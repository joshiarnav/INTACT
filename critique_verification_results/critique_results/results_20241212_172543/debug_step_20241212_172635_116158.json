  "step": {
    "text": "Right. And since $2^4=16$, we can also write the first term as $\\frac{7!}{2^4}$.\n\n# Answer\n\n\\frac{7!}{16}",

      "The nth term of a geometric sequence is given by $ar^{n-1}$, where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.",
      "That's right, so we have the equations $ar^4=7!$ and $ar^7=8!$.",
      "Now if we divide these two equations, we get $\\frac{ar^4}{ar^7}=\\frac{7!}{8!}$.",
      "So, $r^3 = 8$.",
      "That means $r = 2$.",
      "Now we can use the equation $ar^4=7!$ to solve for a.",
      "$a2^4=7!$, so $a=\\frac{7!}{16}$.",
      "So the first term is $\\frac{7!}{16}$."
