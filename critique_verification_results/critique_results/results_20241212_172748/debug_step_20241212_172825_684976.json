    "text": "Now we can just plug in $r=2$ and $n=4$ into the formula for the nth term. That gives us $ar^3=7!$. We can divide both sides of this equation by $2^3$ to get $ar^3=7!$.",

      "The nth term of a geometric sequence is given by $ar^{n-1}$, where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.",
      "That's right, so we have the equations $ar^4=7!$ and $ar^7=8!$.",
      "Now if we divide these two equations, we get $\\frac{ar^4}{ar^7}=\\frac{7!}{8!}$.",
      "So, $r^3 = 8$.",
      "That means $r = 2$."
