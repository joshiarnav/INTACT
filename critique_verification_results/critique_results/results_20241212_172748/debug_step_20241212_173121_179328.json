  "step": {
    "text": "Right. So first let's move all the terms with y to the left side of the equation. So $x^2 - 14x + y^2 - 4y + 7 - 3 = 0$.",

      "Ok, so the first step is to get this equation into the right form.",
      "Right, we want it in the form $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$. That way we can easily find the center and the radius of the circle."
