    "text": "So if we set that equal to the second equation, we get $x-3=5x+1$.\nC: So $x=1$ and $y=\\dfrac{1}{2}$.",

      "Let's begin by finding the intersection point of these lines by setting them equal to each other.\nC: That means we want $2y=-x+3$ to equal $-y=5x+1$.",
      "Right. So we can multiply the first equation by $-1$ to get rid of the negative signs.\nC: That gives us $-2y=x-3$."
