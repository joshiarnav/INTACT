  "step": {
    "text": "Now if we add this equation to the second equation, we can cancel out the $x$ and $y$ terms.\nC: So now we have $-2y+(-y)=x-3+5x+1$.",
    "previous_steps": [
      "Let's begin by finding the intersection point of these lines by setting them equal to each other.\nC: That means we want $2y=-x+3$ to equal $-y=5x+1$.",
      "Right. So we can multiply the first equation by $-1$ to get rid of the negative signs.\nC: That gives us $-2y=x-3$."
