  "problem": "What is the intersection of the lines given by $2y=-x+3$ and $-y=5x+1$?  Enter the answer as an ordered pair.",
  "step": {
    "text": "So if we add that to the second equation, we get $-2y+(-y)=x-3+5x+1$.\nC: That simplifies to $-3y=6x+2$.",
    "previous_steps": [
      "Let's begin by finding the intersection point of these lines by setting them equal to each other.\nC: That means we want $2y=-x+3$ to equal $-y=5x+1$.",
      "Right. So we can multiply the first equation by $-1$ to get rid of the negative signs.\nC: That gives us $-2y=x-3$."
