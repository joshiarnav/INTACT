  "problem": "Regular octagon $A_1A_2A_3A_4A_5A_6A_7A_8$ is inscribed in a circle of area $1.$ Point $P$ lies inside the circle so that the region bounded by $\\overline{PA_1},\\overline{PA_2},$ and the minor arc $\\widehat{A_1A_2}$ of the circle has area $\\tfrac{1}{7},$ while the region bounded by $\\overline{PA_3},\\overline{PA_4},$ and the minor arc $\\widehat{A_3A_4}$ of the circle has area $\\tfrac{1}{9}.$ There is a positive integer $n$ such that the area of the region bounded by $\\overline{PA_6},\\overline{PA_7},$ and the minor arc $\\widehat{A_6A_7}$ of the circle is equal to $\\tfrac{1}{8}-\\tfrac{\\sqrt2}{n}.$ Find $n.$",

      "To start, we can compute the area bounded by the side of the octagon with the minor arc that it subtends",
      "This would be the area of the sector of the circle minus the area of the triangle formed by the center of the circle and the two endpoints of the side of the octagon.",
      "Yeah. And since an octagon has eight sides, we can divide the circle into eight equal sectors.",
      "And we know that the area of the circle is 1, so each sector has area $\\frac{1}{8}$.",
      "Now we have to find the area of the triangle.",
      "We can split the triangle into two right triangles by drawing a line from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the side of the octagon.",
      "That's true. And we know that the hypotenuse of each right triangle is the radius of the circle.",
      "And since the area of the circle is 1, the radius of the circle is $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}}$.",
      "The central angle of the sector that coincides with the sides of the isoceles triangle has measure $\\frac{2\\pi}{8}$",
      "So the right triangle has an angle at the center of the octagon that measures $\\frac{\\pi}{8}$",
      "If we draw a line from the center of the circle to one of the vertices of the octagon, we can see that the right triangle has a leg of length $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}}$ and an angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{8}$.",
      "We have a correction, the hypothenuse of the right triangle has length $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}}$ , not a leg of the right triangle"
