  "problem": "A cube is painted so that one side is blue, two sides are red, and three sides are green. How many different such cubes can be painted? Two cubes are considered the same if one cube can be rotated in any way to match the second cube.",
  "step": {
    "text": "And if we want to check our answer, we can see that there are indeed 60 ways to paint the cube.\n\n# Answer\n\n60",
    "previous_steps": [
      "Let's first consider the number of ways to choose the side that is going to be painted blue.",
      "Yes. Since the cube has six sides, we have six options for the side that we are going to paint blue.",
      "Now, let's consider the number of ways to choose the two sides that are going to be painted red.",
      "Yes. Since we have already chosen one side to paint blue, we only have five sides left. So we have 5 choose 2 ways to choose the sides that we paint red.",
      "Now the remaining three sides must be painted green.",
      "That's correct. So we don't need to consider how to paint those sides.",
      "So the total number of ways to paint the cube is just the product of the number of ways to choose each color.",
      "That's correct. So the total number of ways is $6 * \\binom{5}{2} = 60$."
