      "Let's call the measure of angle $PAB$ $x$. Then, because the three angles are congruent, the measure of each one is $x$.",
      "We know that the sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is $180$.",
      "Actually, it is $180^\\circ$. So $x=60^\\circ$.",
      "We want to find $\\tan x$.",
      "However, the angles are not angles of the same triangle, so they don't sum to $180^\\circ$.",
      "Right. We're finding the tangent of an angle of a triangle, so we should use the tangent addition formula.",
      "That formula is $\\tan(x+y)=\\frac{\\tan x+\\tan y}{1-\\tan x\\tan y}$.",
      "So if we let $AB=13$, $BC=14$, and $CA=15$, we can use the law of cosines to find the tangents of angles $PBC$ and $PCA$.",
      "The law of cosines says that $a^2+b^2-2ab\\cos C=c^2$ where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the sides of the triangle adjacent to angle $C$."
