  "problem": "Two angles of a triangle measure 30 and 45 degrees. If the side of the triangle opposite the 30-degree angle measures $6\\sqrt2$ units, what is the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
  "step": {
    "text": "Right. So we can say $x/\\sin(45) = 6\\sqrt2/\\sin(30)$.",

      "Let's call the unknown side opposite the 45 degree angle $x$.",
      "The side opposite the 30 degree angle is $6\\sqrt2$.",
      "We can use the law of sines to find $x$.",
      "The law of sines says $a/\\sin(A) = b/\\sin(B) = c/\\sin(C)$."
