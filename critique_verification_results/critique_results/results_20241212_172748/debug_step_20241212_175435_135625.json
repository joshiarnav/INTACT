      "We're trying to find the value of $\\sin 45$.",
      "Let's draw a right triangle to help us visualize this problem.",
      "The angle $45^\\circ$ is the angle $A$ in the triangle.",
      "Let's call the side opposite of angle $A$ as $a$.",
      "Let's call the side adjacent to angle $A$ as $b$.",
      "And let's call the hypotenuse $c$.",
      "Since we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to relate $a$, $b$, and $c$.",
      "$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.",
      "That is correct. Now, let's look at the definition of $\\sin$.",
      "$\\sin A = \\frac{a}{c}$.",
      "Assume $c=1$.",
      "So $\\sin A = a$.",
      "And $a^2 + b^2 = 1$.",
      "Since the remaining angle of the triangle is $180^\\circ-90^\\circ-45^\\circ=45^\\circ$ as well, $b=a$.",
      "So $2a^2=1$.",
      "Therefore, $a=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$."
