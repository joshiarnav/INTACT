  "step": {
    "text": "Right, let's do that. We need to divide both sides of the equation by $\\frac{1}{25}$, which is the same as multiplying both sides by $25$. So $25 \\cdot \\frac{x^2}{144} - 25 \\cdot \\frac{y^2}{81} = 25 \\cdot \\frac{1}{25}$.",

      "Let's begin by finding the foci of the ellipse.",
      "The foci of an ellipse are located on the major axis, which is the $x$-axis in this case.",
      "But how do we know that the major axis is the $x$-axis?",
      "Let's find a formula for the foci of the hyperbola first, because the hyperbola is given completely.",
      "That's a good idea. We know that for a hyperbola, the distance from the center to either focus is $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.",
      "In this case, $a=12$ and $b=9$. So the distance is $\\sqrt{12^2+9^2}=\\sqrt{144+81}=\\sqrt{225}=15$.",
      "No, we haven't normalized the equation for the hyperbola."
