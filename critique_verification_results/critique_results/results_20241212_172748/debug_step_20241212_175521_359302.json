      "Let's begin by finding the foci of the ellipse.",
      "The foci of an ellipse are located on the major axis, which is the $x$-axis in this case.",
      "But how do we know that the major axis is the $x$-axis?",
      "Let's find a formula for the foci of the hyperbola first, because the hyperbola is given completely.",
      "That's a good idea. We know that for a hyperbola, the distance from the center to either focus is $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.",
      "In this case, $a=12$ and $b=9$. So the distance is $\\sqrt{12^2+9^2}=\\sqrt{144+81}=\\sqrt{225}=15$.",
      "No, we haven't normalized the equation for the hyperbola.",
      "Right, let's divide both sides by $\\frac{1}{25}$.",
      "We obtain \\[\\frac{x^2}{144/25} - \\frac{y^2}{81/25} = 1.\\]",
      "Now $a=12/5$ and $b=9/5$, so the distance from the center to either focus is $\\sqrt{(12/5)^2+(9/5)^2}=\\sqrt{144/25+81/25}=\\sqrt{225/25}=\\sqrt{9}=3$.",
      "The foci of the hyperbola are located on the $x$-axis, $3$ units to the left and right of the origin.",
      "So the foci of the ellipse must also be located on the $x$-axis, $3$ units to the left and right of the origin.",
      "Since the foci of the ellipse are located at $(-3,0)$ and $(3,0)$, we know that the center of the ellipse is at the origin.",
      "So the major axis is the $x$-axis.",
      "That's true. We also know that the focal length is $3$."
