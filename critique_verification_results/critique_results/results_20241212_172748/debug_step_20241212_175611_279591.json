  "problem": "When we say that Ray is climbing up the stairs $m$ at a time, we mean that he starts on the floor (step $0$) then jumps to step $m$ and then to $2m$ and so on until the number of steps to the top is less than $m$. Ray climbs up a flight of stairs of $n$ steps in two ways. When he does it $4$ steps at a time, there are $3$ steps left at the top. When he does it $5$ steps at a time, there are $2$ steps left at the top. What is the smallest possible value of $n$ that is greater than $10$?",

    "previous_steps": [
      "Let's call $n$ the number of steps.",
      "So, when he climbs them $4$ steps at a time, we know that $n$ leaves a remainder of $3$ when divided by $4$.",
      "That means that $n$ is of the form $4k+3$.",
      "And when he climbs them $5$ steps at a time, we know that $n$ leaves a remainder of $2$ when divided by $5$.",
      "That means that $n$ is of the form $5k+2$.",
      "It is of the form $5l+2$, as $k$ doesn't need to be equal to $l$.",
      "But $n$ is also of the form $4k+3$.",
      "So $n$ is of the form $4k+3$ and $5l+2$ at the same time.",
      "We consider the first values of the form $5l+2$ that are greater than $10$, and check which is the smallest one that leaves a remainder of $3$ modulo $4$.",
      "$5l+2=11$ does not work.",
      "$5l+2=12$ does not work.",
      "For $l=3$, we obtain $5*3+2=17$. This leaves a remainder of $1$ modulo $4$.",
      "For $l=4$, we obtain $5*4+2=22$. This leaves a remainder of $2$ modulo $4$.",
      "For $l=5$, we obtain $5*5+2=27$. This leaves a remainder of $3$ modulo $4$.",
      "So the smallest value of $n$ that is greater than $10$ is $27$.",
      "It is the smallest possible value of $n$ that is greater than $10$ and leaves a remainder of $3$ when divided by $4$, and also leaves a remainder of $2$ when divided by $5$."
