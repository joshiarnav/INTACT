      "To solve this problem, we need to remember the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence.",
      "That formula is $ar^{n-1}$ where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.",
      "That's right. So, we know that the second term is $ar$ and that the fourth term is $ar^3$.",
      "So, we can set up a system of equations. $ar=2$ and $ar^3=6$.",
      "Right. Now we can solve the second equation for r. $r=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{6}{a}}$",
      "Next, we can substitute this expression for r into the first equation.",
      "This gives us $a\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{6}{a}}=2$.",
      "We can now solve for a.",
      "First, we cube both sides of the equation. This gives us $a^3\\frac{6}{a}=2^3$."
