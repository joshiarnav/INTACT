  "problem": "A library has six identical copies of a certain book. At any given time, some of these copies are at the library and some are checked out. How many different ways are there for some of the books to be in the library and the rest to be checked out if at least one book is in the library and at least one is checked out?  (The books should be considered indistinguishable.)",
  "step": {
    "text": "That's right. If we had x indistinguishable books and we wanted to choose y of them, where $y\\le x$, there would be $\\binom{x}{y}=\\frac{x!}{y!(x-y)!}$ ways to do it.",

      "Let's name the number of books in the library x.",
      "The number of books checked out will be 6-x.",
      "Right, and we know that $1\\le x \\le 5$.",
      "So we can write out all the possibilities for x.",
      "We could do that, or we could note that the number of ways for some of the books to be in the library and the rest to be checked out is simply the number of ways to choose the number of books in the library.",
      "So we want to find the number of ways to choose x from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.",
      "That's correct. And since the books are indistinguishable, it doesn't matter which ones are in the library or which ones are checked out.",
      "So we only need to find how many ways there are to choose some number of books from a set of 5."
