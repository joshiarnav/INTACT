      "Let's call the measure of angle $PAB$ $x$. Then, because the three angles are congruent, the measure of each one is $x$.",

      "We want to find $\\tan x$.",
      "However, the angles are not angles of the same triangle, so they don't sum to $180^\\circ$.",
      "Right. We're finding the tangent of an angle of a triangle, so we should use the tangent addition formula.",
      "That formula is $\\tan(x+y)=\\frac{\\tan x+\\tan y}{1-\\tan x\\tan y}$."
