    "text": "We know that $\\tan 60^\\circ=\\sqrt{3}$. So let's plug that into the formula to get $\\tan x=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{3}}{1-\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{3}}$.",

      "Let's call the measure of angle $PAB$ $x$. Then, because the three angles are congruent, the measure of each one is $x$.",
      "We know that the sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is $180$.",
      "Actually, it is $180^\\circ$. So $x=60^\\circ$.",
      "We want to find $\\tan x$.",
      "However, the angles are not angles of the same triangle, so they don't sum to $180^\\circ$.",
      "Right. We're finding the tangent of an angle of a triangle, so we should use the tangent addition formula.",
      "That formula is $\\tan(x+y)=\\frac{\\tan x+\\tan y}{1-\\tan x\\tan y}$."
