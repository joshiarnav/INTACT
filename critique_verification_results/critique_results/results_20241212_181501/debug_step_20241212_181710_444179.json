  "problem": "Two angles of a triangle measure 30 and 45 degrees. If the side of the triangle opposite the 30-degree angle measures $6\\sqrt2$ units, what is the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",

    "text": "So we have a right triangle and can say $\\frac{x}{6\\sqrt2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.",
