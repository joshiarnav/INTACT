      "To solve this problem, we need to remember the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence.",
      "That formula is $ar^{n-1}$ where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.",
      "That's right. So, we know that the second term is $ar$ and that the fourth term is $ar^3$.",
      "So, we can set up a system of equations. $ar=2$ and $ar^3=6$."
