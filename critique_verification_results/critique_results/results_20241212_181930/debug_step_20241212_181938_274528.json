      "In the triangle $ADC$, we have that $x = AE$ is one leg, $y=AD$ is the hypothenuse and $y-2=DE$ is the other leg. Let's apply the Pythagorean theorem there.",
      "We get $x^2+(y-2)^2=y^2$.",
      "Which is the same as $x^2=4y-4$.",
      "And we know that $p = 2+x+2y=2+2\\sqrt{y-1} + 2y$ must be less than 2015.",
      "So $2\\sqrt{y-1}+2y<2013$.",
      "$y=1$ doesn't work, since $x$ must be a positive integer."
