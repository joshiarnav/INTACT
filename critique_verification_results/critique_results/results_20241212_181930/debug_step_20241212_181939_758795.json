How many different values of $p<2015$ are possible?\n$\\textbf{(A) }30\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }31\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }61\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }62\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }63$",

      "Let's call the length of $BC$ $x$ and the length of $AD$ $y$.",
      "The perimeter of the quadrilateral is just $2+x+2y$.",
      "Right, so we want to find all values of $2+x+2y$ that are less than 2015 and $x,y$ are both positive integers.",
      "We can rewrite the equation as $x+2y=p-2$.",
      "Let's construct a point $E$ such that $AE$ is perpendicular to $CD$.",
      "Then $AE$ is equal to $x$.",
      "In the triangle $ADC$, we have that $x = AE$ is one leg, $y=AD$ is the hypothenuse and $y-2=DE$ is the other leg. Let's apply the Pythagorean theorem there.",
      "We get $x^2+(y-2)^2=y^2$.",
      "Which is the same as $x^2=4y-4$.",
      "And we know that $p = 2+x+2y=2+2\\sqrt{y-1} + 2y$ must be less than 2015.",
      "So $2\\sqrt{y-1}+2y<2013$.",
      "$y=1$ doesn't work, since $x$ must be a positive integer.",
      "But $y=2$ does work.",
      "From the equation $x^2 = 4y-4$, we get $y = (x/2)^2 + 1$. So, $y$ is going to be of the form $y = n^2+1$, where $n$ is an integer. We already know that when $n=1, y=1$ and it works.",
      "We can notice that $p = 2+2\\sqrt{y-1} + 2y$ is an increasing function in $y$. So, let's look for the smallest value of $n > 0$ such that $y = n^2+1$ doesn't work. ",
      "Let's try $n = 31$ and see if it works.",
      "Then we have $y = 31^2 + 1 = 962$.",
      "That means $p = 2+2\\sqrt{961} + 2 \\cdot 962 = 1988$",
      "Now, let's try $n=32$."
