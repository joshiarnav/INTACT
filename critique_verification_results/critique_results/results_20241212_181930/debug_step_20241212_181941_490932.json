  "problem": "The numbers 60, 221, and 229 are the legs and hypotenuse of a right triangle.  Find the multiplicative inverse to 450 modulo 3599.  (Express your answer as an integer $n$ with $0\\leq n<3599$.)",
  "step": {
    "text": "And we can divide both sides by $8$ because $8$ is relatively prime to $3599$.",

      "We can start by applying the Pythagorean theorem to the numbers 60, 221, and 229.",
      "That gives $60^2 + 221^2 = 229^2$.",
      "Observe that $450=221+229$.",
      "Rewrite the equation as $60^2=229^2-221^2=(221+229)(229-221)$.",
      "I see that $(221+229)$ is a factor on the right side.",
      "Take this equation modulo $3599$.",
      "This means we can replace $221+229$ with $450$.",
      "And we can replace $229-221$ with $8$.",
      "So $60^2 \\equiv 450 \\cdot 8 \\pmod{3599}$."
