      "So to be divisible by 6, the number must be divisible by 2 and 3.",
      "Right, so it must end in an even number. The largest even digit is 8.",
      "But it also must be divisible by 3. We can find out if a number is divisible by 3 if we add up all of its digits and then if that sum is divisible by 3, then the number is divisible by 3."
