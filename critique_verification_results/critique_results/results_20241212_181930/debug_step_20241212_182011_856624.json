      "To start, we can compute the area bounded by the side of the octagon with the minor arc that it subtends",
      "This would be the area of the sector of the circle minus the area of the triangle formed by the center of the circle and the two endpoints of the side of the octagon.",
      "Yeah. And since an octagon has eight sides, we can divide the circle into eight equal sectors.",
      "And we know that the area of the circle is 1, so each sector has area $\\frac{1}{8}$.",
      "Now we have to find the area of the triangle.",
      "We can split the triangle into two right triangles by drawing a line from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the side of the octagon.",
      "That's true. And we know that the hypotenuse of each right triangle is the radius of the circle."
