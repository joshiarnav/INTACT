  "problem": "Point $P$ is located inside triangle $ABC$ so that angles $PAB, PBC,$ and $PCA$ are all congruent. The sides of the triangle have lengths $AB=13, BC=14,$ and $CA=15.$  Find $\\tan \\angle PAB.$",
  "step": {
    "text": "That is $\\tan x = \\tan(\\angle PAB) = \\tan( \\angle PBC + \\angle PCA) = \\frac{\\tan \\angle PBC + \\tan \\angle PCA}{1 - \\tan \\angle PBC \\cdot \\tan \\angle PCA}$.",

      "Let's call the measure of angle $PAB$ $x$. Then, because the three angles are congruent, the measure of each one is $x$.",
      "We know that the sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is $180$.",
      "Actually, it is $180^\\circ$. So $x=60^\\circ$.",
      "We want to find $\\tan x$.",
      "However, the angles are not angles of the same triangle, so they don't sum to $180^\\circ$.",
      "Right. We're finding the tangent of an angle of a triangle, so we should use the tangent addition formula."
