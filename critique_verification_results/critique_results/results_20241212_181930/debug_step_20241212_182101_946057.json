      "Let's call the integer we're looking for x.",
      "We know x is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.",
      "Well, the LCM of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 is 60.",
      "So x could be written as 60n + 1 for some integer n.",
      "That's correct. We just need to find the smallest integer n such that x is a two-digit number.",
      "If n is 1, then x is 61.",
      "If n is 2, then x is 121.",
      "That's a three-digit number.",
      "So the only value that works is $n=1$.",
      "So the number we're looking for is 61."
