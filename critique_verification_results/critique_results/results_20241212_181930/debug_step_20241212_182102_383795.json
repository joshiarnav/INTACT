  "problem": "Two angles of a triangle measure 30 and 45 degrees. If the side of the triangle opposite the 30-degree angle measures $6\\sqrt2$ units, what is the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
  "step": {
    "text": "And the three angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees, so the last angle is 105 degrees.",

      "The side opposite the 30 degree angle is $6\\sqrt2$."
