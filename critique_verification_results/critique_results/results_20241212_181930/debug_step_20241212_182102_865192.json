  "problem": "Two angles of a triangle measure 30 and 45 degrees. If the side of the triangle opposite the 30-degree angle measures $6\\sqrt2$ units, what is the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",

      "Let's call the unknown side opposite the 45 degree angle $x$.",
      "The side opposite the 30 degree angle is $6\\sqrt2$.",

      "The law of sines says $a/\\sin(A) = b/\\sin(B) = c/\\sin(C)$."
