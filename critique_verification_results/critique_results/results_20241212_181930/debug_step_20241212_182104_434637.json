  "problem": "Two angles of a triangle measure 30 and 45 degrees. If the side of the triangle opposite the 30-degree angle measures $6\\sqrt2$ units, what is the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
  "step": {
    "text": "Plugging in the values of the sines, we obtain $y=\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}$.",

      "Let's call the unknown side opposite the 45 degree angle $x$.",
      "The side opposite the 30 degree angle is $6\\sqrt2$.",
      "We can use the law of sines to find $x$.",
      "The law of sines says $a/\\sin(A) = b/\\sin(B) = c/\\sin(C)$.",
      "We can use the same formula to determine the remaining side.",
      "That side is opposite the 105 degree angle.",
      "We know the angle measures, and we know the side opposite one of the angles, so we can write $x/\\sin(45) = 6\\sqrt2/\\sin(30)$.",
      "Call it $y$, and plug it into the formula.",
      "We obtain $x/\\sin(45^\\circ) = 6\\sqrt{2}/\\sin(30^\\circ) = y/\\sin(105^\\circ)$.",
      "That gives us $x = \\sin(45^\\circ)/\\sin(30^\\circ) \\cdot 6\\sqrt{2} = 12$.",
      "We can also find y by plugging in $x$.",
      "This yields $y=\\sin(105^\\circ)/\\sin(45^\\circ)*12$."
