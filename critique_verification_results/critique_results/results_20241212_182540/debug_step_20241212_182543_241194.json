      "The nth term of a geometric sequence is given by $ar^{n-1}$, where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.",
      "That's right, so we have the equations $ar^4=7!$ and $ar^7=8!$.",
      "Now if we divide these two equations, we get $\\frac{ar^4}{ar^7}=\\frac{7!}{8!}$.",
      "So, $r^3 = 8$.",
      "That means $r = 2$.",
      "Now we can use the equation $ar^4=7!$ to solve for a."
