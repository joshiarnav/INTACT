      "Right, we want it in the form $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$. That way we can easily find the center and the radius of the circle.",
      "So let's move the $4y$ to the left side by subtracting $4y$ from both sides.",
      "And let's move the $-14x$ to the left side by adding $14x$ to both sides.",
      "That gives us $x^2+y^2-7-4y+14x = 3$."
