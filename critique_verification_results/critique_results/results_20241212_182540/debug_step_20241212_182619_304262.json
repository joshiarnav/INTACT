  "problem": "The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers such that $f(f(n)) = 2n$ and $f(4n + 1) = 4n + 3$ for all positive integers $n.$  Find $f(1000).$",
  "step": {
    "text": "And $f(f(508))=1016$.",
    "previous_steps": [
      "Since $f(f(n))=2n$, we have $f(f(1))=f(f(1))=2$.",
      "And since $f(4n+1)=4n+3$, we have $f(5)=f(4*1+1)=4*1+3=7$.",
      "So, $f(f(5))=f(7)=2*5=10$.",
      "And $f(9)=f(4*2+1)=4*2+3=11$.",
      "So, $f(f(9))=f(11)=2*9=18$.",
      "And $f(13)=f(4*3+1)=4*3+3=15$.",
      "So, $f(f(13))=f(15)=2*13=26$.",
      "So we have $f(f(1))=2$, $f(f(5))=10$, $f(f(9))=18$, $f(f(13))=26$, ...",
      "That means that we can write $f(f(4n+1))=2(4n+1)$ for all positive integers $n$.",
      "Now we need to find $f(1000)$.",
      "Ok, let's write $1000$ as $125*2^{3}$.",
      "So $f(1000)=f(125*2^{3})$.",
      "So, $f(1000)=f(f(f(f(f(f(125))))))$.",
      "And we can write $125$ as $4*31 + 1$.",
      "So, $f(125)=f(4*31+1)=4*31+3=127$.",
      "So, $f(1000)=f(f(f(f(f(127)))))=f(f(f(254)))$",
      "Let's go back a little and see that actually $f(1000)=f(f(f(f(f(f(f(125)))))))$. Sorry for that mistake.",
      "That's ok. So we have $f(1000)=f(f(f(f(f(f(127))))))$.",
      "And we know that $f(f(127)) = 254$.",
      "So we have $f(1000)=f(f(f(f(254))))$.",
      "And now $f(f(254))=508$.",
      "So we have $f(1000)=f(f(508))$."
