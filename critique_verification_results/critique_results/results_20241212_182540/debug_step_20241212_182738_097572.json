  "problem": "Two angles of a triangle measure 30 and 45 degrees. If the side of the triangle opposite the 30-degree angle measures $6\\sqrt2$ units, what is the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
  "step": {
    "text": "That side is opposite the 45 degree angle, so the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse is $\\sin 45$.",
