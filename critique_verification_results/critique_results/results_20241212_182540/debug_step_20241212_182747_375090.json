      "Let's find a formula for the foci of the hyperbola first, because the hyperbola is given completely.",
      "That's a good idea. We know that for a hyperbola, the distance from the center to either focus is $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.",
      "In this case, $a=12$ and $b=9$. So the distance is $\\sqrt{12^2+9^2}=\\sqrt{144+81}=\\sqrt{225}=15$.",
