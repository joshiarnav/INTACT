      "So we're looking for an integer $n$ that satisfies two properties: $-90 < n < 90$ and $\\tan n^\\circ = \\tan 312^\\circ$.",
      "Right, and we should mention that the function $\\tan$ has a period of $180^\\circ$.",
      "That's true. That means that $\\tan (x^\\circ) = \\tan (x^\\circ + 180^\\circ)$.",
      "Right. So to find the value of $n$ that satisfies the equation $\\tan n^\\circ = \\tan 312^\\circ$, we can add or subtract $180^\\circ$ from $312^\\circ$ until we find an angle $n^\\circ$ that is between $-90^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$.",
      "Right. So we can subtract $180^\\circ$ once from $312^\\circ$ to get $n^\\circ = 132^\\circ$, but that doesn't satisfy the inequality."
