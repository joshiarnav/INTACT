      "Let's try to divide $x^{13} + x + 90$ by $x^2 - x + a$.",
      "We should get a remainder of 0 for this to work.",
      "Yeah, so let's do polynomial long division.",
      "Ok, so the first term of our dividend is $x^{13}$, and the first term of our divisor is $x^2$.",
      "So $x^{13}$ divided by $x^2$ is $x^{11}$.",
      "And $x^{11}$ times $x^2$ is $x^{13}$.",
      "So our first term matches.",
      "The next term of the dividend is $x$, and the next term of the divisor is $-x$.",
      "$x^{11}$ multiplied by $x$ is $x^{12}$.",
      "And $x^{11}$ multiplied by $a$ is $ax^{11}$.",
      "So, the remainder is $x^{12}-ax^{11}+90$.",
      "And since $x^{12}$ divided by $x^2$ is $x^{10}$, the next term of the quotient is $x^{10}$.",
      "So $x^{10}$ times $x^2$ is $x^{12}$.",
      "And $x^{10}$ times $-x$ is $-x^{11}$."
