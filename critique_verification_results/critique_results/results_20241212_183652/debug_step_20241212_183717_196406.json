      "Let's try to divide $x^{13} + x + 90$ by $x^2 - x + a$.",
      "We should get a remainder of 0 for this to work.",
      "Yeah, so let's do polynomial long division.",
      "Ok, so the first term of our dividend is $x^{13}$, and the first term of our divisor is $x^2$.",
      "So $x^{13}$ divided by $x^2$ is $x^{11}$.",
      "And $x^{11}$ times $x^2$ is $x^{13}$.",
      "So our first term matches.",
      "The next term of the dividend is $x$, and the next term of the divisor is $-x$.",
      "$x^{11}$ multiplied by $x$ is $x^{12}$.",
      "And $x^{11}$ multiplied by $a$ is $ax^{11}$.",
      "So, the remainder is $x^{12}-ax^{11}+90$.",
      "And since $x^{12}$ divided by $x^2$ is $x^{10}$, the next term of the quotient is $x^{10}$.",
      "So $x^{10}$ times $x^2$ is $x^{12}$.",
      "And $x^{10}$ times $-x$ is $-x^{11}$.",
      "Ok, we can take a quick road here. Let's see that if $x=0$, then $a$ must divide 90. And if $x=1$, $a$ must divide 92.",
      "Right. So $a$ must be a factor of 90 and 92.",
      "The factors of 90 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, and 90. The factors of 92 are 1, 2, 4, 23, 46, and 92."
