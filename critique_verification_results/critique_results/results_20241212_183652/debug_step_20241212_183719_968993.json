      "Let's complete the square to make this easier to work with.",
      "We can rewrite the first equation as $x^2-14x+y^2-6y=6$.",
      "The first thing we want to do is complete the square for the $x$ terms.",
      "So we'll add $(14/2)^2$ to both sides.",
      "That gives us $x^2-14x+49+y^2-6y=6+49$.",
      "Now we can complete the square for the $y$ terms.",
      "We just need to add $(6/2)^2$ to both sides.",
      "That gives us $x^2-14x+49+y^2-6y+9=6+49+9$.",
      "Now we can factor both $x^2-14x+49$ and $y^2-6y+9$ terms.",
      "So we get $(x-7)^2+(y-3)^2=0+64$.",
      "We can simplify that to $(x-7)^2+(y-3)^2=64$.",
      "So that's a circle centered at $(7,3)$ with a radius of $8$.",
      "Right. Now we just need to find the slope of the line $3x+4y=k$.",
      "That's just $-3/4$.",
      "Let's express $y$ in terms of $x$ using the expression of the circle.",
      "That's $y=3+\\sqrt{64-(x-7)^2}$.",
      "Now we can plug that in to the equation for the slope."
