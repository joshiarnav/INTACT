      "So to be divisible by 6, the number must be divisible by 2 and 3.",
      "Right, so it must end in an even number. The largest even digit is 8.",
      "But it also must be divisible by 3. We can find out if a number is divisible by 3 if we add up all of its digits and then if that sum is divisible by 3, then the number is divisible by 3.",
      "The sum of the digits of the number is $2+3+4+5+N=14+N$.",
      "For 14+N to be divisible by 3, N must be 1 or 4.",
      "Since 1 is not an even number, the largest digit N is 4."
