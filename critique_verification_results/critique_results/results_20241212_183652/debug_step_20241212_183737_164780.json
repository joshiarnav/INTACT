  "step": {
    "text": "But it also must be divisible by 3. We can find out if a number is divisible by 3 if we add up all of its digits and then if that sum is divisible by 3, then the number is divisible by 3.",
    "previous_steps": [
      "So to be divisible by 6, the number must be divisible by 2 and 3.",
      "Right, so it must end in an even number. The largest even digit is 8."
