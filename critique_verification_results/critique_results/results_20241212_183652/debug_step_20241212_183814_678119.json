      "To start, we can compute the area bounded by the side of the octagon with the minor arc that it subtends",
      "This would be the area of the sector of the circle minus the area of the triangle formed by the center of the circle and the two endpoints of the side of the octagon.",
      "Yeah. And since an octagon has eight sides, we can divide the circle into eight equal sectors.",
      "And we know that the area of the circle is 1, so each sector has area $\\frac{1}{8}$.",
      "Now we have to find the area of the triangle.",
      "We can split the triangle into two right triangles by drawing a line from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the side of the octagon.",
      "That's true. And we know that the hypotenuse of each right triangle is the radius of the circle.",
      "And since the area of the circle is 1, the radius of the circle is $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}}$.",
      "The central angle of the sector that coincides with the sides of the isoceles triangle has measure $\\frac{2\\pi}{8}$",
      "So the right triangle has an angle at the center of the octagon that measures $\\frac{\\pi}{8}$",
      "If we draw a line from the center of the circle to one of the vertices of the octagon, we can see that the right triangle has a leg of length $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}}$ and an angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{8}$.",
      "We have a correction, the hypothenuse of the right triangle has length $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}}$ , not a leg of the right triangle",
      "So the right triangle's side that is adjacent to the angle measuring $\\frac{\\pi}{8}$ has length $(\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{8})\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}}$",
      "And the right triangle's side that is opposite to the angle measuring $\\frac{\\pi}{8}$ has length $(\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{8})\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}}$",
      "So the right triangle has area $\\frac{1}{2}((\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{8})\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}})((\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{8})\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}})$",
      "And since there are two of these right triangles, the area of the central triangle is $((\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{8})\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}})((\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{8})\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}})$",
      "So the area of the region bounded by the side of the octagon and the minor arc it subtends is $\\frac{1}{8} - ((\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{8})\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}})((\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{8})\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}})$",
      "We can use the identity $\\sin 2x = 2(\\sin x)( \\cos x)$ to evaluate $(\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{8})(\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{8})$",
      "Yeah. This is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}(\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$",
      "Then the area of the region bounded by the side of the octagon and the minor arc it subtends is $\\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}(\\frac{1}{\\pi})$",
      "And we know that the area of the region bounded by $\\overline{PA_1},\\overline{PA_2},$ and the minor arc $\\widehat{A_1A_2}$ of the circle has area $\\tfrac{1}{7}$.",
      "And we know that the area of the region bounded by $\\overline{PA_3},\\overline{PA_4},$ and the minor arc $\\widehat{A_3A_4}$ of the circle has area $\\tfrac{1}{9}$.",
      "If we denote the area of $\\triangle PA_1A_2$ by $[PA_1A_2]$ then $[PA_1A_2] = \\frac{1}{7} - \\left( \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4\\pi}\\right)$ ",
      "We can simplify this to $[PA_1A_2] = \\frac{1}{56} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4\\pi}$",

      "$[PA_3A_4] =  \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4\\pi} - \\frac{1}{72}$",
      "We can also get the side length of the octagon, which is $2(\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{8})\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}}$",
      "And we can get the apothem of the octagon, which is $(\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{8})\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}}$.",
      "Using the half-measure identity $\\sin \\frac{x}{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\cos x}{2}}$, we can compute for the value of $\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{8}$",
      "We know that $\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so $\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{8} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{2}}$",
      "Simplifying this, we get that $\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}{2}$",
      "So the side length of the octagon is $2(\\frac{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}{2})\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}}$",
      "And the apothem of the octagon is $(\\frac{\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{2})\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}}$",
      "Now, we plot the octagon on the Cartesian plane such that the circle is centered at the origin, $A_1A_2$ is parallel to the $x$-axis, $A_3A_4$ is parallel to the $y$-axis, $A_1$ is in the fourth quadrant, $A_2$ and $A_3$ are in the first quadrant, and $A_4$ is in the third quadrant. ",
      "The coordinates of $A_1$ are $\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}}\\right)$",

      "We have a correction. The point at $\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}},\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}}\\right)$ is $A_3$",
      "The coordinates of $A_4$ are $\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}},-\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}}\\right)$",
      "So $A_6$ is $\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}}, -\\sqrt{\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}}\\right)$ and $A_7$ is  $\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}},-\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}}\\right)$",
      "Using the Shoelace Formula, we can compute for the area of $\\triangle PA_6A_7$",

      "However, we can't use the shoelace formula right now since we don't know the coordinates of $P$",
      "If we denote the area of $\\triangle PA_6A_7$ by $[PA_6A_7]$ then we need the base and height of $\\triangle PA_6A_7$ to compute for $[PA_6A_7]$",
      "The base of $\\triangle PA_6A_7$ is the distance from $A_6$ to $A_7$ and the height of $\\triangle PA_6A_7$ is the distance from $P$ to $\\overline{A_6A_7}$",
      "But the distance from $A_6$ to $A_7$ is the side length of the octagon",
      "So the base of $\\triangle PA_6A_7$ is $\\sqrt{\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}}$",
      "We should compute for the height of $\\triangle PA_6A_7$",
      "We know that the height of $\\triangle PA_6A_7$ is the distance from $P$ to $\\overline{A_6A_7}$",
      "And the distance from $P$ to $\\overline{A_6A_7}$ is the distance from $A_2$ to $A_7$ minus the distance from $P$ to $\\overline{A_2A_3}$",
      "To compute for $A_2 A_7$, we use the fact that $\\triangle A_2A_7A_6$ is a right triangle",
      "So we can compute for $A_2A_7$ using the Pythagorean Theorem: $A_2A_7 = \\sqrt{A_2A_6^2 + A_6A_7^2}$",
      "$A_6A_7$ is the side length of the octagon while $A_2A_6$ is a diameter of of the circle",
      "So $A_2A_6 = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi}}$",
      "$A_6A_7$ is the side length of the octagon, which is $\\sqrt{\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}}$",
      "So $A_2 A_7 = \\sqrt{4\\frac{1}{\\pi} + \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}} = \\sqrt{6\\frac{1}{\\pi} - \\sqrt{2}\\frac{1}{\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6 - \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}}$",
      "However, we still don't know the distance from $P$ to $\\overline{A_2A_3}$",
      "We can compute the distance from $P$ to $\\overline{A_2A_3}$ using the formula of the distance of a point to the line",
      "The formula for the distance of a point to a line is $\\frac{ax_1 + by_1 + c}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}$ where the equation of the line is $ax + by + c = 0$",
      "Let's find the equation of the line passing through $A_2$ and $A_3$",
      "$A_2$ is at $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}}\\right)$ while $A_3$ is at $\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}},\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}}\\right)$",
