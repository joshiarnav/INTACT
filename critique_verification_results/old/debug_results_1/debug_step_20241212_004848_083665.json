      "We can start by applying the Pythagorean theorem to the numbers 60, 221, and 229.",
      "That gives $60^2 + 221^2 = 229^2$.",
      "Observe that $450=221+229$.",
      "Rewrite the equation as $60^2=229^2-221^2=(221+229)(229-221)$.",
      "I see that $(221+229)$ is a factor on the right side.",

      "This means we can replace $221+229$ with $450$."
