  "problem": "An unfair coin lands on heads with probability $\\frac34$ and tails with probability $\\frac14$.  A heads flip gains $\\$3$, but a tails flip loses $\\$8$.  What is the expected worth of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",

    "text": "That simplifies to $E=\\frac{9}{4}-2$.",

      "So the expected value is equal to the probability of getting heads times the value of heads plus the probability of getting tails times the value of tails.",
      "Let's call the expected value E. So we can write that as $E=\\frac{3}{4}*3+\\frac{1}{4}*(-8)$."
