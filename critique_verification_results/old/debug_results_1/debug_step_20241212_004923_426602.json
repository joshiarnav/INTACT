  "step": {
    "text": "If we subtract $x$ from both sides of the equation, we get $9x+2=-3$.",
    "previous_steps": [
      "Let's begin by finding the intersection point of these lines by setting them equal to each other.\nC: That means we want $2y=-x+3$ to equal $-y=5x+1$.",
      "Right. So we can multiply the first equation by $-1$ to get rid of the negative signs.\nC: That gives us $-2y=x-3$.",
      "The equation of the second line can be written as $y=-5x-1$. And then we can substitute this in the equation of the first line.",
      "That gives us $-2(-5x-1)=x-3$.\nC: We can then distribute the $-2$ on the left side of the equation. That gives us $10x+2=x-3$."
