      "In other words, we need to find the values of $x$ that make the function output a real number.",
      "Right. Let's break this up into two cases.",
      "Ok, first we consider the first radical: $\\sqrt[3]{x - 1}.$",
      "The cube root is defined for any value of $x$",
      "So $x$ can be any real number.",
      "Now let's look at the second radical: $\\sqrt[3]{8 - x}.$",
      "This is also defined for any value of $x$.",
      "But we need to be careful because the two radicals are added together.",
      "The sum of two radicals is only defined if both radicals are defined.",
      "So we need $x$ to be a number that makes both radicals defined.",
      "We have said that both radicals are defined for any value of x",
      "So their sum should also be defined for any value of $x$.",
      "Right. So the domain of the function is all real numbers."
