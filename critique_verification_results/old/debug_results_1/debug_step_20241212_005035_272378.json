  "problem": "Given a triangle, its midpoint triangle is obtained by joining the midpoints of its sides. A sequence of polyhedra $P_{i}$ is defined recursively as follows: $P_{0}$ is a regular tetrahedron whose volume is 1. To obtain $P_{i + 1}$, replace the midpoint triangle of every face of $P_{i}$ by an outward-pointing regular tetrahedron that has the midpoint triangle as a face. The volume of $P_{3}$ is $\\frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.",

    "text": "The side length of the midpoint triangle is half the side length of the original triangle.",

      "So what's a regular tetrahedron?",
      "It is a polyhedron with $4$ faces, each of which are equilateral triangles.",

      "It is also an equilateral triangle.",
      "Then what can we say about the relationship between the side length of the original equilateral triangle and the side length of the midpoint triangle?"
