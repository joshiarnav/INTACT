  "problem": "A standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\\spadesuit$, $\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, and $\\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top three cards are all $\\spadesuit$s?",

      "There are a total of 52 cards in the deck so there are 52 ways to choose the first card.",
      "But once we choose the first card, there are only 51 ways to choose the second card, right?",
      "That's right. And once we choose the first two cards, there are 50 ways to choose the third card.",
      "So there are $52\\times51\\times50=132600$ ways to choose three cards from the deck.",
      "But if the top three cards are all spades, then there are 13 ways to choose the first card.",
      "And once we choose the first card, there are 12 ways to choose the second card.",
      "And 11 ways to choose the third card.",
      "So there are $13\\times12\\times11=1716$ ways to choose three spades from the deck.",
      "So the probability that the top three cards are all spades is $\\dfrac{1716}{132600}$.",
      "To shorten that fraction, don't perform the multiplications too soon and write the desired probability as $p=\\frac{13\\times 12\\times 11}{52\\times 51\\times 50}$.",
      "Yes. And we can see that both the numerator and the denominator are divisible by 13.",
      "We obtain $p=\\frac{12\\times 11}{4\\times 51\\times 50}$. We can simplify this further."
