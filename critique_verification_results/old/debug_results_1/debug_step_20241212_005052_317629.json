      "I think that we should use the discriminant of the quadratic equation to find the rational roots.",
      "Me too. The discriminant is $b^2-4ac$.",
      "But we can simplify that further. The quadratic equation is $y=x^2-7x-c$, so $a=1$, $b=-7$, and $c=-c$.",
      "So the discriminant is $49-4(-c)$. In order for the discriminant to be a perfect square, $49-4(-c)$ must be equal to $0$ or a perfect square.",
      "$49-4(-c)$ is equal to $0$ when $c=\\frac{49}{4}$.",
      "We made a sign error. The expression for the discriminant is $49+4c$.",
      "Right. So $49+4c$ must be equal to $0$ or a perfect square.",
      "We only need to consider integer $c$, i.e. those between $\\left \\lceil{-\\frac{49}{4}}\\right \\rceil$ and $25$ inclusive.",
      "That's a good point. So we have $c\\in \\left \\{-12, -11, \\ldots , 24, 25 \\right \\}$."
