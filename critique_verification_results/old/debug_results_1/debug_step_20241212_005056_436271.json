  "problem": "If the integer $k^{}_{}$ is added to each of the numbers $36^{}_{}$, $300^{}_{}$, and $596^{}_{}$, one obtains the squares of three consecutive terms of an arithmetic series. Find $k^{}_{}$.",
  "step": {
    "text": "And since $d$ is positive, $d=4$.",
    "previous_steps": [
      "So, if we add $k$ to each of the numbers $36$, $300$, and $596$, we get $36+k$, $300+k$, and $596+k$.",
      "And these three numbers are the squares of three consecutive terms of an arithmetic series.",
      "That means that $(36+k)$ is the square of the first term, $(300+k)$ is the square of the second term, and $(596+k)$ is the square of the third term.",
      "So, if we call the first term $a$, then we have that $36+k=a^2$, $300+k=(a+d)^2$, and $596+k=(a+2d)^2$.",
      "That means that $k=a^2-36$, $k=(a+d)^2-300$, and $k=(a+2d)^2-596$.",
      "So, we have that $a^2-36=(a+d)^2-300$, and $a^2-36=(a+2d)^2-596$.",
      "That means that $a^2-36=a^2+2ad+d^2-300$, and $a^2-36=a^2+4ad+4d^2-596$.",
      "So, we have that $2ad+d^2=264$, and $4ad+4d^2=560$.",
      "We can divide the second equation by $4$ to get $ad+d^2=140$.",
      "And we can subtract this equation from the first equation to get $ad=124$.",
      "So, $a=\\frac{124}{d}$.",
      "We can substitute this into the equation $2ad+d^2=264$ to get $2\\cdot\\frac{124}{d}\\cdot d+d^2=264$.",
      "This simplifies to $248+d^2=264$.",
      "So, $d^2=16$."
