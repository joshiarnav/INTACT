    "text": "So the units digit of the base-6 representation of $217*45$ is 3.",

      "So we have to multiply 217 and 45.",
      "Ok, so that's 7*5 which is 35. Then we carry the 3.",

      "First we divide 9 by 6 to get 1 as the first digit.",
      "$1*6=6$. So, now we have $9-6=3$ and we drop the $7$ and divide $37$ by $6$.",
      "The second digit is 6.",
      "So, $6*6=36$. Now we have $37-36=1$.",
      "Now, we drop the $6$ and divide $16$ by $6$.",
      "The third digit is 2.",
      "So, $2*6=12$. Now we have $16-12=4$.",
      "Now, we drop the $5$ and divide $45$ by $6$.",
      "The fourth digit is 7.",
      "So, $7*6=42$. Now we have $45-42=3$."
