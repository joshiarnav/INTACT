      "Let's start with finding $g(2)$.",
      "So the equation is $2x^2+2x-1$, so when we plug in 2 for $x$, we get $2(2)^2+2(2)-1$.",
      "That simplifies to $8+4-1$, which is $11$.",
      "Now we know that $g(2)=11$, so we can plug that into the equation to find $g(g(2))$.",
      "That means we need to plug in 11 for $x$, so we get $2(11)^2+2(11)-1$.",
      "Which simplifies to $2\\cdot121+2\\cdot11-1$.",
      "Continuing to simplify, we get $242+22-1$."
