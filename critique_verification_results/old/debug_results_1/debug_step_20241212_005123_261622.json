  "problem": "Define a $\\it{good\\ word}$ as a sequence of letters that consists only of the letters $A$, $B$, and $C$ --- some of these letters may not appear in the sequence --- and in which $A$ is never immediately followed by $B$, $B$ is never immediately followed by $C$, and $C$ is never immediately followed by $A$. How many seven-letter good words are there?",

      "Let's start at the beginning.",
      "I think the first letter can be any of the 3 letters, so there are 3 choices.",
      "That's true by definition since none of the letters are immediately followed by a certain other letter.",
      "Now let's look at the second letter.",
      "If the first letter was A, then the second letter can only be A or C, so there are only 2 choices.",
      "Right, since B cannot immediately follow A.",
      "Similarly, if the first letter was B, then the second letter can only be A or B, so there are only 2 choices.",
      "And if the first letter was C, then the second letter can only be B or C, so there are only 2 choices.",
      "So in all cases, there are 2 choices for the second letter.",
      "So far, there are 3 * 2 = 6 possible choices.",
      "Now let's look at the third letter.",
      "If the first two letters were AA, then the third letter can only be A or C, so there are only 2 choices.",
      "So, we see that we can apply the same reasoning for the remaining five letters.",
      "So, the last five letters have the same number of choices as the second letter.",
      "So, there are 2 choices for each of the last five letters."
