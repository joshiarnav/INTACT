    "text": "That's right. So, let's first do the denominator. We have a=2 and b=3i, so we get $a^2-b^2=4-9i^2=4-(9\\cdot -1)=4+9=13$.",

      "Let's multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of 2+3i, which is 2-3i.",
      "So, we get $\\displaystyle\\frac{(1-i)(2-3i)}{(2+3i)(2-3i)}$.",
      "The denominator is easy to compute, since we have $(a+b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2$.",
      "The numerator is also not that hard, since we just need to distribute and remember that $i^2=-1$."
