  "problem": "Convert the point $( -2, -2 \\sqrt{3}, -1)$ in rectangular coordinates to cylindrical coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta,z),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$",
  "step": {
    "text": "So in this case, $z=-1$.",

      "Now, let's find the radius $r$. To do this, we'll need to find the distance between the point and the $z$-axis.",
      "This distance is just the square root of the sum of the squares of the $x$- and $y$- coordinates.",
      "In other words, $r=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.",
      "So in this case, $r=\\sqrt{(-2)^2+(-2\\sqrt{3})^2}$.",
      "That simplifies to $\\sqrt{4+12}$.",
      "And then $r=\\sqrt{16}$.",
      "So $r=4$. Now let's find $\\theta$.",
      "First, we need to see in which quadrant the point lies.",
      "The $x$-coordinate is negative and the $y$-coordinate is negative, so the point is in the third quadrant.",
      "$\\theta$ is simply the arctangent of the ratio of the $y$- and $x$- coordinates.",
      "And remember that since we're in the third quadrant, $\\theta$ must be between $\\pi$ and $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.",
      "So in this case, $\\theta=\\arctan{\\frac{-2\\sqrt{3}}{-2}}$.",
      "This simplifies to $\\arctan{\\sqrt{3}}$.",
      "This means the line segment from the point $(-2,-2\\sqrt{3})$ to $(0,0)$ makes an angle measuring $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ with the x-axis",
      "So $\\theta=\\frac{4\\pi}{3}$. Finally, the $z$-coordinate is simply the $z$-coordinate of the point in rectangular coordinates."
