      "Let's first find $\\sqrt[3]{0.000064}$.",
      "We can rewrite that as $0.000064^{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
      "That's true. And $0.000064=\\frac{64}{1000000}$.",
      "So we can rewrite the expression as $\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{64}{1000000}}$",
      "Right. And $\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{64}{1000000}}=\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{64}}{\\sqrt[3]{1000000}}$.",
      "And $\\sqrt[3]{64}=4$.",
      "So $\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{64}{1000000}}=\\frac{4}{100}$.",
      "And $\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{0.000064}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{4}{100}}$.",
      "Simplifying, we get $\\frac{2}{10}$.",
      "And as a decimal, that's $0.2$.",
      "And rounding to the nearest tenth, we get $0.2$."
