    "text": "So Pete started with 10.",

      "First, let's set up an equation. Let x be the number Pete started with.",
      "So the equation would be 4(2x+10)=120.",
      "That's correct. Now all we need to do is solve for x.",
      "First, we can simplify 4(2x+10) to 8x+40.",
      "Now we can set 8x+40 equal to 120.",
      "That gives us 8x=80, so x=10."
