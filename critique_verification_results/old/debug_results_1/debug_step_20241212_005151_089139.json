  "problem": "Pete thinks of a number. He doubles it, adds 10, multiplies by 4, and ends up with 120. What was his original number?",
  "step": {
    "text": "So our answer is correct.\n\n# Answer\n\n10",
    "previous_steps": [
      "First, let's set up an equation. Let x be the number Pete started with.",
      "So the equation would be 4(2x+10)=120.",
      "That's correct. Now all we need to do is solve for x.",
      "First, we can simplify 4(2x+10) to 8x+40.",
      "Now we can set 8x+40 equal to 120.",
      "That gives us 8x=80, so x=10.",
      "So Pete started with 10.",
      "Right. We can check our answer by starting with 10 and performing each of the operations Pete did.",
      "First he doubled it, which gives us 10*2=20.",
      "Then he added 10, which gives 20+10=30.",
      "Finally, he multiplied by 4 which gives 30*4=120.",
      "So we end up with 120, just like the problem says."
