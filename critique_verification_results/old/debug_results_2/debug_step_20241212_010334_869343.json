      "We should get a remainder of 0 for this to work.",
      "Yeah, so let's do polynomial long division.",
      "Ok, so the first term of our dividend is $x^{13}$, and the first term of our divisor is $x^2$.",
      "So $x^{13}$ divided by $x^2$ is $x^{11}$.",
      "And $x^{11}$ times $x^2$ is $x^{13}$.",
      "So our first term matches."
