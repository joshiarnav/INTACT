  "problem": "Two angles of a triangle measure 30 and 45 degrees. If the side of the triangle opposite the 30-degree angle measures $6\\sqrt2$ units, what is the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
  "step": {
    "text": "We know the angle measures, and we know the side opposite one of the angles, so we can write $x/\\sin(45) = 6\\sqrt2/\\sin(30)$.",
    "previous_steps": [
      "Let's call the unknown side opposite the 45 degree angle $x$.",
      "The side opposite the 30 degree angle is $6\\sqrt2$.",
      "We can use the law of sines to find $x$.",
      "The law of sines says $a/\\sin(A) = b/\\sin(B) = c/\\sin(C)$.",
      "We can use the same formula to determine the remaining side.",
      "That side is opposite the 105 degree angle."
