      "I think the easiest way to do this is to convert the number to base 10.",
      "Yeah, me too. To do that, we just need to multiply each digit by the corresponding power of 2 and add everything up.",
      "The first digit from left to right means $1*2^{11}$.",
      "That's $2048$.",
      "The next digit means $0*2^{10}$, which is 0.",
      "The third digit means $0*2^9$, which is $0$.",
      "The fourth digit means $1*2^8$, which is $256$.",
      "The fifth digit means $0*2^7$, or $0$.",
      "The sixth digit means $1*2^6$, which is 64.",
      "The seventh digit means $1*2^5$, which is 32.",
      "The eighth digit means $1*2^4$, which is 16.",
      "The ninth digit means $0*2^3$, or 0.",
      "The tenth digit means $0*2^2$, which is 0.",
      "And the last digit means $1*2^1$, or 2.",
      "Let's add all of that up.",
      "2048 + 0 + 0 + 256 + 0 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 0 + 0 + 2.",
      "And we get 2418.",
      "But we still need to divide that by 4 and find the remainder.",
      "Yeah, so we get 2418 / 4 = 604 remainder 2."
