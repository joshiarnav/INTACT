      "Well, $n$ is a positive integer, but we need to make sure that $3n + 4$ is also a positive integer.",
      "Right. So we need $n > -4/3$. Since $n$ must be a positive integer, we know that $n \\geq 1$.",
      "Well, let's use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of $3n + 4$ and $n$.",
      "Ok. We divide $3n + 4$ by $n$ and find that the remainder is $4$.",
      "So now we need to find the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $4$."
