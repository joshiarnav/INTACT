  "step": {
    "text": "Right. So if the greatest common divisor is 4, then the sum is 4. If the greatest common divisor is 2, then the sum is 2 + 4 = 6. If the greatest common divisor is 1, then the sum is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.",

      "Well, we can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor.",
      "Right, but we have to be careful because the Euclidean algorithm only works for positive integers.",
      "Right. So, to use the Euclidean algorithm, we need to be given two positive integers.",
      "Well, $n$ is a positive integer, but we need to make sure that $3n + 4$ is also a positive integer.",
      "Right. So we need $n > -4/3$. Since $n$ must be a positive integer, we know that $n \\geq 1$.",
      "Well, let's use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of $3n + 4$ and $n$.",
      "Ok. We divide $3n + 4$ by $n$ and find that the remainder is $4$.",
      "So now we need to find the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $4$.",
      "But 4 has only 1, 2, and 4 as factors",
      "So the greatest common divisor must be 4, 2, or 1.",
      "But the question asks for the sum of all possible values of the greatest common divisor."
