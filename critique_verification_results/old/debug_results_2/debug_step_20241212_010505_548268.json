      "For a particle moving in two dimensions, we can find the speed by finding the magnitude of the velocity vector.",
      "Recall that the velocity vector is the derivative of the position vector.",
      "That's right. So the velocity vector is $(2, 4)$.",
      "Now we just need to find the magnitude of this vector.",
      "Recall that the magnitude of a vector $(a, b)$ is $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.",
      "So the magnitude of the vector $(2,4)$ is $\\sqrt{2^2 + 4^2}$."
