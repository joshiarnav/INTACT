      "So, if we add $k$ to each of the numbers $36$, $300$, and $596$, we get $36+k$, $300+k$, and $596+k$.",
      "And these three numbers are the squares of three consecutive terms of an arithmetic series.",
      "That means that $(36+k)$ is the square of the first term, $(300+k)$ is the square of the second term, and $(596+k)$ is the square of the third term.",
