Increasing the height of the cylinder by $6$ units also increases the volume by $y$ cubic units.

      "So we know that if we increase the radius by $6$ units, the volume increases by $y$ cubic units.",
      "And we also know that if we increase the height by $6$ units, the volume also increases by $y$ cubic units.",
      "Right, so let's set up some equations.",
      "I think we should use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $\\pi r^2h$.",
      "Ok, so if we increase the radius by $6$ units, the new volume is $\\pi (r+6)^2h$ and the difference in volume is $\\pi (r+6)^2h - \\pi r^2h = \\pi h(r+6)^2 - \\pi r^2h$.",
      "And that's equal to $y$, so $\\pi h(r+6)^2 - \\pi r^2h = y$.",
      "Ok, and if we increase the height by $6$ units, the new volume is $\\pi r^2(h+6)$ and the difference in volume is $\\pi r^2(h+6) - \\pi r^2h = \\pi r^2(h+6-h)$.",
      "And that's also equal to $y$, so $\\pi r^2(h+6) - \\pi r^2h = y$.",
      "So we end up with two equations.",
      "And we can use substitution to solve the system.",
      "Right, so $\\pi h(r+6)^2 - \\pi r^2h = \\pi r^2(h+6) - \\pi r^2h$.",
      "Ok, so we can subtract $\\pi r^2h$ from both sides of the equation to get $\\pi h(r+6)^2 = \\pi r^2(h+6)$.",
      "And we can divide both sides by $\\pi$ to get $h(r+6)^2 = r^2(h+6)$.",
      "And we know that the original height is 2.",
      "So we can substitute $h=2$ into the equation to get $2(r+6)^2 = r^2(2+6)$.",
      "Ok, so we can simplify that equation to get $2(r+6)^2 = 8r^2$.",
      "And we can simplify even further to get $2(r^2 + 12r + 36) = 8r^2$.",
      "Now we can subtract $2r^2$ from both sides of the equation to get $24r + 72 = 6r^2$.",
      "And we can subtract $24r + 72$ from both sides of the equation to get $6r^2 - 24r - 72 = 0$.",
      "Now we can divide both sides of the equation by $6$ to get $r^2 - 4r - 12 = 0$."
