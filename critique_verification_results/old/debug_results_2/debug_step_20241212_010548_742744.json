      "So the square has to be at least as wide as the $3\\times 4$ rectangle.",
      "And it has to be at least as tall as the $2\\times 3$ rectangle.",
      "So we can put the $3\\times 4$ rectangle down first, and then fit the $2\\times 3$ rectangle next to it.",
      "That means the width of the square is $3+2=5$.",
      "So, we see that a square of length 5 works.",
      "That's true, but we want to find the smallest possible area, so we need to check if a square of length 4 would work."
