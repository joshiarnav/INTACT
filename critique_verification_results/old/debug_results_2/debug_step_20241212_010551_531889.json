      "Let's call the side of the square x.",
      "So the perimeter would be 4x, right?",
      "Yep. The area would be x*x, which is x^2.",
      "So we need to solve the equation 4x=x^2.",
      "We could solve this by factoring or by using the quadratic formula.",
      "Let's factor.",
      "We could start by writing it as x^2-4x=0",
      "From there, we can factor out an x.",
      "So we get x*(x-4)=0",
      "So, x=0 or x-4=0.",
      "Right. The first solution doesn't make sense in this context."
