Only a man can be assigned to a male role, and only a woman can be assigned to a female role. If five men and six women audition, in how many ways can the six roles be assigned?",

      "Right, so we need to multiply these two numbers together to get the total number of combinations of women.",
      "That would be 6*5=30.",
      "Now we need to choose the actors for the remaining two roles.",
      "And at the beginning we had 11 people and we have already chosen 2 for male roles and 2 for female roles.",
      "So there are 11-4=7 people left.",
      "And we have 7 choices for the first role and 6 choices for the second."
