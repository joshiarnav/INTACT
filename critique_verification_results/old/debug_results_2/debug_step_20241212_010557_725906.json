  "problem": "A play has two different male roles, two different female roles and two different roles that can be either gender. Only a man can be assigned to a male role, and only a woman can be assigned to a female role. If five men and six women audition, in how many ways can the six roles be assigned?",
  "step": {
    "text": "Right so there are 25200 ways to assign the six roles.\n\n# Answer\n\n25200",

      "Ok, so we have two male roles, two female roles and two other roles.",
      "Yes, so we need to choose the actors for the male and female roles first.",
      "Right, so we have 5 choices for the first male role and 4 choices for the second male role.",
      "So we need to multiply these two numbers together to get the total number of combinations of men.",
      "That would be 5*4=20.",
      "Now we have 6 choices for the first female role and 5 choices for the second female role.",
      "Right, so we need to multiply these two numbers together to get the total number of combinations of women.",
      "That would be 6*5=30.",
      "Now we need to choose the actors for the remaining two roles.",
      "And at the beginning we had 11 people and we have already chosen 2 for male roles and 2 for female roles.",
      "So there are 11-4=7 people left.",
      "And we have 7 choices for the first role and 6 choices for the second.",
      "Right, so we need to multiply these two numbers together to get the total number of combinations for these two roles.",
      "That would be 7*6=42.",
      "Now we need to multiply all of our results together to get the total number of combinations.",
      "So it would be 20*30*42=25200."
