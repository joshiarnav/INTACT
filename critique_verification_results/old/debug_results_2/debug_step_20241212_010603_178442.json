      "Let's break the terms into two sequences, one for the powers of 2, and one for the powers of 3.",
      "So the powers of 2 are $2^1$, $2^2$, $2^3$, $2^4$, $2^5$...",
      "And the powers of 3 are $3^2$, $3^4$, $3^6$...",
      "So the first sequence is $\\frac{1}{2^1} + \\frac{3}{2^2} + \\frac{5}{2^3} + \\frac{7}{2^4} + \\frac{9}{2^5}...$",

      "We can write a general formula for the first sequence. The $n$th term is $\\frac{2n-1}{2^n}$",
      "We made an error. Upon double-checking, we see that the general formula for the nth term of the first sequence is $\\frac{2n+1}{2^{2n+1}}$",
      "Right. Now let's find a general formula for the second sequence.",
      "The denominator will be $3^{2n}$",
      "Yes, and the numerator is $2n$",
      "So the general formula for the second sequence is $\\frac{2n}{3^{2n}}$.",
      "Now let's combine the two sequences into one.",
      "We'll need to use the common denominator, which is $2^{2n+1} 3^{2n}$.",
      "So the $n$th term of the combined sequence is $\\frac{2n+1}{2^{2n+1}} + \\frac{2n}{3^{2n}}$.",
      "We can combine this into a single fraction: $\\frac{2n+1}{2^{2n+1}} + \\frac{2n}{3^{2n}} = \\frac{3^{2n}(2n+1) + 2n*2^{2n+1}}{2^{2n+1}*3^{2n}}$.",
      "Let's write a general formula for the numerator.",
      "The first term is $3^{2n} * (2n+1)$ and the second term is $2n * 2^{2n+1}$",
      "So the general formula for the numerator is $3^{2n} * (2n+1) + 2n * 2^{2n+1}$.",
      "Now we can write the general formula for the sequence."
