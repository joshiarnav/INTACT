      "This looks like a job for cofactor expansion.",
      "Agreed. Let's do the expansion along the top row.",
      "The first entry is $1$, and its cofactor is\n\\[\\begin{vmatrix} x + y & y \\\\ x & x + y \\end{vmatrix}.\\]\nWe can compute this determinant by cofactor expansion as well, but let's take a shortcut.",
      "The determinant of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ is $ad - bc$.",
      "So the cofactor of the first entry is $(x + y)^2 - xy = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - xy = x^2 + xy + y^2$.\nThe second entry is $x$, and its cofactor is\n\\[\\begin{vmatrix} 1 & y \\\\ 1 & x + y \\end{vmatrix}.\\]\nThis is a $2 \\times 2$ determinant, so its value is $(x + y) - y = x$.\nThe third entry is $y$, and its cofactor is\n\\[\\begin{vmatrix} 1 & x + y \\\\ 1 & x \\end{vmatrix}.\\]\nThis is also a $2 \\times 2$ determinant, so its value is $(x) - (x + y) = -y$.",
      "Now we just need to multiply these out and add them up.",
      "So the answer is $1 \\cdot (x^2 + xy + y^2) + x \\cdot (x) + y \\cdot (-y)$.",
      "Which simplifies to $x^2 + xy + y^2 + x^2 - y^2$."
