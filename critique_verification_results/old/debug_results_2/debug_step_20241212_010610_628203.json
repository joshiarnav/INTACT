    "text": "For a factor of $n$ to be a multiple of 150, a must be between 1 and 10, b must be between 1 and 14, and c must be between 2 and 8.",

      "Right. Any factor of $n$ must be of the form $2^a * 3^b * 5^c$, where a is between 0 and 10, b is between 0 and 14, and c is between 0 and 8.",
      "But for a factor of $n$ to be a multiple of 150, it must have a power of 2 raised to at least 1, a power of 3 raised to at least 1, and a power of 5 raised to at least 2.",
      "That's correct. Let's count the factors of $n$ that are multiples of 150."
