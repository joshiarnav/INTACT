      "First, I will find the solutions in the interval $0\\le x\\le\\pi$.",
      "I will use the double-angle formula for cosine to write $\\cos4x$ in terms of $\\cos2x$.",
      "The double-angle formula for cosine tells us that $\\cos2\\theta=2\\cos^2\\theta-1$.",
      "Therefore, $\\cos4x=2\\cos^2 2x-1$.",
      "I will now use the double-angle formula for cosine to write $\\cos2x$ in terms of $\\cos x$.",
      "So, $\\cos 2x=2\\cos^2 x-1$.",
      "Now, I will replace $\\cos4x$ and $\\cos2x$ in the equation with the expressions we found.",
      "That means we need to solve the equation $2\\cos^2 2x-1+\\cos^2 3x+\\cos^3 2x+\\cos^4 x=0$.",
      "Let's make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let $u=\\cos x$. Then $\\cos^2 x=u^2$, $\\cos^3 x=u^3$, $\\cos^4 x=u^4$, $\\cos 2x=2u^2-1$ and $\\cos^2 2x=(2u^2-1)^2$.",
      "Now we can replace all the trigonometric functions with $u$ and its powers.",
      "The equation becomes $2(2u^2-1)^2+\\cos^2 3x+(2u^2-1)^3+u^4=0$."
