      "Ok. First, let's find the number of positive integers less than 200 divisible by 2.",
      "We can do that by dividing 200 by 2.",
      "We get 100.",
      "Wait, there's an easier way to do this. Notice that this is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers less than $200$ that are divisible by $2*3*5=30$. "
