      "We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.",
      "Ok. First, let's find the number of positive integers less than 200 divisible by 2.",
      "We can do that by dividing 200 by 2.",
      "We get 100.",
      "Wait, there's an easier way to do this. Notice that this is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers less than $200$ that are divisible by $2*3*5=30$. ",
      "That's true. The least positive integer divisible by 30 is 30 and the greatest positive integer divisible by 30 is 180.",
      "So, the number of positive integers less than 200 that are divisible by 2,3, and 5 is the same as the number of positive integers from 30 to 180, inclusive, that are divisible by 30.",
      "That's the same as the number of positive integers from 1 to 6, inclusive, that are divisible by 1."
