  "problem": "A quadrilateral that has consecutive sides of lengths $70,90,130$ and $110$ is inscribed in a circle and also has a circle inscribed in it. The point of tangency of the inscribed circle to the side of length 130 divides that side into segments of length $x$ and $y$. Find $|x-y|$.\n$\\text{(A) } 12\\quad \\text{(B) } 13\\quad \\text{(C) } 14\\quad \\text{(D) } 15\\quad \\text{(E) } 16$",

      "We first find the area of the quadrilateral.",
      "To do that we can use Brahmagupta's Formula, which is $A=\\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)}$ where $s$ is the semiperimeter and $a,b,c,d$ are the side lengths.",
      "The semiperimeter is $s=\\frac{70+90+130+110}{2}=200$.",
      "So we have $A=\\sqrt{(200-70)(200-90)(200-130)(200-110)}$.",
      "Simplifying that gives $A=\\sqrt{(130)(110)(70)(90)}$.",
      "We can simplify further by factoring out a $10$ from each of the terms inside the square root, which gives $A=\\sqrt{(13\\cdot10)(11\\cdot10)(7\\cdot10)(9\\cdot10)}$.",
      "So the area is $A=\\sqrt{(13\\cdot11\\cdot7\\cdot9)\\cdot(10\\cdot10\\cdot10\\cdot10)}$.",
      "So $A=\\sqrt{13\\cdot11\\cdot7\\cdot9\\cdot10000}$."
