      "We first find the area of the quadrilateral.",
      "To do that we can use Brahmagupta's Formula, which is $A=\\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)}$ where $s$ is the semiperimeter and $a,b,c,d$ are the side lengths.",
      "The semiperimeter is $s=\\frac{70+90+130+110}{2}=200$.",
      "So we have $A=\\sqrt{(200-70)(200-90)(200-130)(200-110)}$.",
      "Simplifying that gives $A=\\sqrt{(130)(110)(70)(90)}$.",
      "We can simplify further by factoring out a $10$ from each of the terms inside the square root, which gives $A=\\sqrt{(13\\cdot10)(11\\cdot10)(7\\cdot10)(9\\cdot10)}$.",
      "So the area is $A=\\sqrt{(13\\cdot11\\cdot7\\cdot9)\\cdot(10\\cdot10\\cdot10\\cdot10)}$.",
      "So $A=\\sqrt{13\\cdot11\\cdot7\\cdot9\\cdot10000}$.",
      "And $A=\\sqrt{13\\cdot11\\cdot7\\cdot9}\\cdot100$.",
      "And $A=\\sqrt{9009}\\cdot100$.",
      "Right, and $\\sqrt{9009}$ is $3\\cdot3\\cdot1001$.",
      "So, we have that the area of $ABCD$ is $300\\sqrt{1001}$.",
      "Now we find the radius of the inscribed circle.",
      "We can use the formula $A=rs$ where $A$ is the area, $r$ is the radius of the inscribed circle, and $s$ is the semiperimeter.",
      "We found the area and semiperimeter earlier.",
      "So, we have $r=\\frac{300\\sqrt{1001}}{200}$.",
      "And that simplifies to $r=\\frac{3\\sqrt{1001}}{2}$.",
      "Let $O$ be the center of the incircle and $X,Y,Z$ and $W$ the points of tangency on $AB, BC, CD$ and $DA$ repectively. Now, it's easy to see that quadrilaterals $AXOW$ and $OYCZ$ are similar. Let's use this.",
      "From this, we have $\\frac{CY}{OX}=\\frac{OY}{AX}$.",
      "Let $CZ$ have length $n$. Then we can find that $AX=AW=n-40$.",
      "Right. Also, since $OX$ is a radius of the circle, it has length $r$.",
      "$CY = CZ$, so we have $\\frac{n}{r}=\\frac{r}{n-40}$.",
      "So $n^2-40n=r^2$. We can plug in the value of $r$ we found earlier.",
      "$n^2-40n=\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{1001}}{2}\\right)^2$.",
      "And this simplifies to $n^2-40n=\\frac{9\\cdot1001}{4}$.",
      "We can multiply both sides of the equation by $4$ to get $4n^2-160n=9\\cdot1001$.",
      "Right. And $9\\cdot1001=9009$.",
      "The equation now is $4n^2-160n=9009$.",
      "We want to solve for $n$. To do that we can use the quadratic formula.",
      "Right. The quadratic formula is $n=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.",
      "And for our equation, $a=4, b=-160$ and $c=-9009$."
