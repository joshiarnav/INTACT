      "Well, if it's a factor, then 18 should be divisible by 3.",
      "Right. And 18 is divisible by 3.",
      "So, a is true.",

      "If it is, then we should be able to divide 187 by 17 and get an integer result.",
      "And we do.",
      "But we also have to check if $52$ is a divisor of $187$.",

      "And it isn't. So far, so good.",
      "Now let's see if 24 is a divisor of 72."
