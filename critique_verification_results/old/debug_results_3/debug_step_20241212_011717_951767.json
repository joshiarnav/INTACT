  "problem": "Each edge length of a rectangular solid is a prime number. If the volume of the rectangular solid is 385 cubic units, what is the total surface area, in square units, of the rectangular solid?",
  "step": {
    "text": "So the total surface area would be $334$.",
    "previous_steps": [
      "We know that the volume of this rectangular solid is the product of its three side lengths.",
      "Let's call those side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$. The volume is $abc$.",
      "Since the volume is $385$, we can write the equation $abc=385$.",
      "Now let's figure out the possible values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.",
      "We know that all of the side lengths are prime, and that the only factors of $385$ are $1$, $5$, $7$, $11$, and $385$.",
      "So the possible values for $a$, $b$, and $c$ are $1$, $5$, and $7$.",
      "Actually, that was a mistake. 1 cannot be a possible value because 1 is not prime. So the possible values are 5, 7 and 11.",
      "Now let's find the possible number of surface area. We know that the surface area of a rectangular solid is $2ab+2bc+2ac$.",
      "So let's plug in the possible values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. If $a=5$, $b=7$, and $c=11$, then the surface area would be $2\\cdot5\\cdot7+2\\cdot7\\cdot11+2\\cdot5\\cdot11$.",
      "Which is $70+154+110$."
