      "So first we should find the vertex of the parabola $y=x^2+2$.",
      "Right, so that means $x=0$.",
      "And plugging that into the equation, we get that the vertex is at $(0,2)$.",
      "Now let's find the center of the hyperbola.",
      "Ok, so we know that the center is at $(0,0)$.",
      "Now let's find the slope of the parabola at the vertex.",
      "Right, so the derivative of the parabola is $2x$, so the slope is $0$ at the vertex."
