      "So first we should find the vertex of the parabola $y=x^2+2$.",
      "Right, so that means $x=0$.",
      "And plugging that into the equation, we get that the vertex is at $(0,2)$.",
      "Now let's find the center of the hyperbola.",
      "Ok, so we know that the center is at $(0,0)$.",
      "Now let's find the slope of the parabola at the vertex.",
      "Right, so the derivative of the parabola is $2x$, so the slope is $0$ at the vertex.",
      "Now let's find the slope of the hyperbola.",
      "The $y>0$ branch of the hyperbola has equation $y=\\sqrt{1+mx^2}$.",
      "The derivative of that is $\\frac{mx}{\\sqrt{1+mx^2}}$.",
      "And plugging in $x=0$ we get that the slope is $0$ as well.",
      "So parabola and hyperbola are tangent at the vertex if they intersect at that point.",
      "So we need to find $m$ such that the point $(0,2)$ is on the hyperbola."
