  "problem": "The parabola $y = x^2+2$ and the hyperbola $y^2 - mx^2 = 1$ are tangent. Find $m.$",

    "text": "This occurs when $m=4\\pm2\\sqrt{3}$.",

      "So first we should find the vertex of the parabola $y=x^2+2$.",
      "Right, so that means $x=0$.",
      "And plugging that into the equation, we get that the vertex is at $(0,2)$.",
      "Now let's find the center of the hyperbola.",
      "Ok, so we know that the center is at $(0,0)$.",
      "Now let's find the slope of the parabola at the vertex.",
      "Right, so the derivative of the parabola is $2x$, so the slope is $0$ at the vertex.",
      "Now let's find the slope of the hyperbola.",
      "The $y>0$ branch of the hyperbola has equation $y=\\sqrt{1+mx^2}$.",
      "The derivative of that is $\\frac{mx}{\\sqrt{1+mx^2}}$.",
      "And plugging in $x=0$ we get that the slope is $0$ as well.",
      "So parabola and hyperbola are tangent at the vertex if they intersect at that point.",
      "So we need to find $m$ such that the point $(0,2)$ is on the hyperbola.",
      "However, this doesn't work because $mx^2$ is always $0$ at $x=0$. Let's calculate the intersection points by plugging in the equation for the parabola into that for the hyperbola.",
      "Ok, doing that we get $x^4+4x^2+4-mx^2=1$.",
      "This can be simplified to $x^4+3x^2+3-mx^2=0$.",
      "We can further simplify this to $x^4+(3-m)x^2+3=0$.",
      "So the equation for the intersection points is $x^4+(3-m)x^2+3=0$.",
      "Now let's use the quadratic formula to solve for $x^2$ in this equation.",
      "Ok, so $x^2=\\frac{m-3\\pm\\sqrt{(3-m)^2-4\\cdot1\\cdot3}}{2}$.",
      "This equation can be simplified to $x^2=\\frac{m-3\\pm\\sqrt{m^2-6m+9-12}}{2}$.",
      "And further simplified to $x^2=\\frac{m-3\\pm\\sqrt{m^2-6m-3}}{2}$.",
      "The intersection points are tangent if the discriminant vanishes.",
      "Right, so $m^2-6m-3=0$.",
      "We can solve this equation using the quadratic formula as well.",
      "Ok, so $m=\\frac{6\\pm\\sqrt{6^2-4\\cdot1\\cdot-3}}{2}$.",
      "This is $m=\\frac{6\\pm\\sqrt{48}}{2}$, but we can ignore the negative solution as it wouldn't result in a hyperbola.",
      "We actually made a mistake when simplifying the expression $x^4+4x^2+4-mx^2=1$. It should be simplified to $x^4+(4-m)x^2+3=0$.",
      "Let's solve that equation.",
      "Ok, so $x^2=\\frac{m-4\\pm\\sqrt{(4-m)^2-4\\cdot1\\cdot3}}{2}$.",
      "We are interested in when the discriminant is $0$, i.e. when $(4-m)^2-12=0$."
