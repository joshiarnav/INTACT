  "problem": "Given a triangle, its midpoint triangle is obtained by joining the midpoints of its sides. A sequence of polyhedra $P_{i}$ is defined recursively as follows: $P_{0}$ is a regular tetrahedron whose volume is 1. To obtain $P_{i + 1}$, replace the midpoint triangle of every face of $P_{i}$ by an outward-pointing regular tetrahedron that has the midpoint triangle as a face. The volume of $P_{3}$ is $\\frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.",
  "step": {
    "text": "Ok, so for $i=0$, we have $4$ faces.",
    "previous_steps": [
      "So what's a regular tetrahedron?",
      "It is a polyhedron with $4$ faces, each of which are equilateral triangles.",
      "What can we say about the midpoint triangle of an equilateral triangle?",
      "It is also an equilateral triangle.",
      "Then what can we say about the relationship between the side length of the original equilateral triangle and the side length of the midpoint triangle?",
      "The side length of the midpoint triangle is half the side length of the original triangle.",
      "Then what can we say about the ratio of the volumes of the original tetrahedron and the outward-pointing tetrahedron?",
      "The side length of the midpoint triangle is half the side length of the original triangle, so the volume of the outward-pointing tetrahedron is $(\\frac{1}{2})^3 = \\frac{1}{8}$ times the volume of the original tetrahedron.",
      "So what is the volume of $P_1$?",
      "It is the volume of $P_0$, plus the volume of the $4$ tetraheda we added. We obtain $1+4*1/8=1.5$.",
      "So what is the volume of $P_2$?",
      "Let's find a general expression for the number of faces of $P_i$, and the volume of the tetraheda we add in each step."
