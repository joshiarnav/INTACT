      "We can start by completing the square for the x's and y's respectively.",
      "Ok. We'll start with the x's. So we have $x^2+12x=x^2+12x+36$.",
      "Right. And that equals $(x+6)^2$.",
      "Now we'll do the y's. We have $y^2+16y=y^2+16y+64$.",
      "No, these equations aren't true. But we complete the square by adding $6^2+8^2$ on both sides.",
      "That's true. So we have $x^2+12x+36+y^2+16y+64=0+36+64$.",
      "Right. Now we can rewrite that as $(x+6)^2+(y+8)^2=100$.",
      "This is the equation of a circle with center $(-6,-8)$ and radius 10.",
      "So the area enclosed by the region is equal to the area of the circle, which is $\\pi r^2$."
