      "Ok well let's use polynomial long division.",
      "What's that?",
      "Well let's say we are dividing $x^5 + 7$ by $x + 1$. First we check if the degree of the first term is greater than or equal to the degree of the second term.",
      "The degree of the first term is 5 and the degree of the second term is 1.",
      "That's right. So now we divide the first term of the polynomial by the first term of the divisor.",
      "So we divide $x^5$ by $x$ which is $x^4$.",
      "Right. So now we multiply $x + 1$ by $x^4$ which is $x^5 + x^4$.",
      "And then we subtract that from $x^5 + 7$.",
      "Right. So $x^5 + 7 - (x^5 + x^4)$ is $7 - x^4$.",
      "So now we check if the degree of the result is greater than or equal to the degree of the divisor.",
      "The degree of the result is 4 and the degree of the divisor is 1.",
      "So we can continue. Now we divide the first term of the result by the first term of the divisor.",
      "That would be $-x^4$ divided by $x$ which is $-x^3$.",
      "And then we multiply the divisor by $-x^3$ which is $-x^4 - x^3$.",
      "Then we subtract that from $7 - x^4$ which is $7 - x^4 - (-x^4 - x^3)$. So that's $7 - x^4 + x^4 + x^3$.",
      "So that's $7 + x^3$.",
      "Right. So now we check the degree.",
      "The degree is 3 which is greater than 1.",
      "We divide the highest-order term of the result by the highest-order term of the divisor.",
      "So that's $x^3$ divided by $x$ which is $x^2$.",
      "We multiply the divisor by $x^2$ which is $x^3 + x^2$.",
      "And then we subtract that from the result $7 + x^3$.",
      "So that's $7 + x^3 - (x^3 + x^2)$ which is $7 - x^2$.",
      "So now we check the degree.",
      "The degree is 2.",
      "Which is greater than the degree of the divisor.",
      "So we divide the highest-order term of the result by the highest-order term of the divisor.",
      "That's $-x^2$ divided by $x$ which is $-x$.",
      "We multiply the divisor by $-x$ which is $-x^2 - x$.",
      "And then we subtract that from the result $7 - x^2$.",
      "So that's $7 - x^2 - (-x^2 - x)$ which is $7 - x^2 + x^2 + x$.",
      "And so now we check the degree.",
      "The degree is 1.",
      "Which is equal to the degree of the divisor.",
      "So we divide the highest-order term of the result by the highest-order term of the divisor.",
      "That's $x$ divided by $x$ which is $1$.",
      "We multiply the divisor by $1$ which is $x + 1$.",
      "And then we subtract that from the result $7 - x^2 + x^2 + x$.",
      "So that's $7 - x^2 + x^2 + x - (x + 1)$ which is $7 - 1$."
