      "We need to find when the denominator equals 0.",
      "The denominator is $8x^2-65x+8$.",

      "The quadratic formula is $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.",
      "That's correct. In this case, $a=8$, $b=-65$, and $c=8$.",
      "So, the two values of $x$ that make the denominator 0 are $x=\\frac{65\\pm\\sqrt{65^2-4\\cdot8\\cdot8}}{2\\cdot8}$",
