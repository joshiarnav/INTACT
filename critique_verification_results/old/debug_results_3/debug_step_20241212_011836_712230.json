      "Let's call the radius of the small molds x.",
      "The volume of an object scales with the length cubed.",
      "That means if the ratio of the radii of the two objects is x:1, then the ratio of their volumes is x^3:1^3, or x^3:1.",
      "So, the volume of the big bowl is equal to the sum of the volumes of the small molds.",
      "That means we need to solve the equation 1^3:1=27*x^3:1.",
      "That simplifies to 1=27x^3.",
      "And x^3=1/27."
