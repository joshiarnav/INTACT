  "problem": "Four positive integers $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ have a sum of 64. If $A+3 = B-3 = C \\times 3 = D \\div 3$, what is the value of the product $A \\times B \\times C \\times D$?",

    "text": "We found that A + 3 = C * 3 and A + 3 = D / 3.",

      "Let's first find the value of A.",
      "We know that A + B + C + D = 64.",
      "We also know that A + 3 = B - 3.",
      "So, B = A + 6.",
      "A + B + C + D = 64 then becomes A + A + 6 + C + D = 64.",
      "That simplifies to 2A + C + D = 58.",
      "We also know that A + 3 = C * 3.",
      "So, C = (A + 3) / 3.",

      "We can plug that in to 2A + C + D = 58.",

      "We get 6A + A + 3D = 171.",
      "That simplifies to 7A + 3D = 171.",
      "We also know that A + 3 = D / 3.",
      "So, D = 3A + 9.",
      "We can plug that in to 7A + 3D = 171.",
      "We get 7A + 3(3A + 9) = 171.",
