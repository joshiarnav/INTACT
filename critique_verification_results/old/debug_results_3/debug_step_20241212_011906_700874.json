    "text": "And $x=70-109+25$.",

      "To find the median, we first have to order the list from least to greatest.",
      "$x$ is a negative integer, so it is the first number.",
      "$12$ is the next lowest number.",
      "So, the ordered list is $\\{$x, 12, 14, 38, 45$\\}$.",
      "To find the median, we now pick the middle number.",
      "The middle number is 14, so the median is 14.",
      "We are also given that the median is five less than the mean.",
      "To find the mean, we simply add up all the numbers and divide by the number of numbers.",
      "So the mean is $\\frac{x+12+14+38+45}{5}$.",
      "That simplifies to $\\frac{x+109}{5}$.",
      "So we now have the equation $14=\\frac{x+109}{5}-5$.",
      "If we multiply both sides of the equation by $5$, we get $70=x+109-25$."
