      "Let's break the terms into two sequences, one for the powers of 2, and one for the powers of 3.",
      "So the powers of 2 are $2^1$, $2^2$, $2^3$, $2^4$, $2^5$...",
      "And the powers of 3 are $3^2$, $3^4$, $3^6$...",
      "So the first sequence is $\\frac{1}{2^1} + \\frac{3}{2^2} + \\frac{5}{2^3} + \\frac{7}{2^4} + \\frac{9}{2^5}...$",
      "And the second sequence is $\\frac{2}{3^2} + \\frac{4}{3^4} + \\frac{6}{3^6}...$",
      "We can write a general formula for the first sequence. The $n$th term is $\\frac{2n-1}{2^n}$",
      "We made an error. Upon double-checking, we see that the general formula for the nth term of the first sequence is $\\frac{2n+1}{2^{2n+1}}$",
      "Right. Now let's find a general formula for the second sequence.",
      "The denominator will be $3^{2n}$",
      "Yes, and the numerator is $2n$",
      "So the general formula for the second sequence is $\\frac{2n}{3^{2n}}$.",
      "Now let's combine the two sequences into one.",
      "We'll need to use the common denominator, which is $2^{2n+1} 3^{2n}$.",
      "So the $n$th term of the combined sequence is $\\frac{2n+1}{2^{2n+1}} + \\frac{2n}{3^{2n}}$.",
      "We can combine this into a single fraction: $\\frac{2n+1}{2^{2n+1}} + \\frac{2n}{3^{2n}} = \\frac{3^{2n}(2n+1) + 2n*2^{2n+1}}{2^{2n+1}*3^{2n}}$.",
      "Let's write a general formula for the numerator.",
      "The first term is $3^{2n} * (2n+1)$ and the second term is $2n * 2^{2n+1}$",
      "So the general formula for the numerator is $3^{2n} * (2n+1) + 2n * 2^{2n+1}$.",
      "Now we can write the general formula for the sequence.",
      "Right. The $n$th term is $\\frac{3^{2n} * (2n+1) + 2n * 2^{2n+1}}{2^{2n+1}*3^{2n}}$.",
      "Now we can write the series in summation notation.",
      "The series is $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{3^{2n} * (2n+1) + 2n * 2^{2n+1}}{2^{2n+1}*3^{2n}}$.",
      "We can simplify the series by cancelling terms from numerator and denominator.",
      "So $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{3^{2n} * (2n+1) + 2n * 2^{2n+1}}{2^{2n+1}*3^{2n}} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{3^{2n} * (2n+1)}{2^{2n+1}*3^{2n}} + \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{2n * 2^{2n+1}}{2^{2n+1}*3^{2n}} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{2n+1}{2^{2n+1}} + \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{2n}{3^{2n}}$.",
      "Let's evaluate the first sum.",
      "Let $X$ be the sum of the first sequence, so $X = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2^3} + \\frac{5}{2^5} + \\dots$",
      "Notice that if we multiply $X$ by $\\frac{1}{4}$\u200b, we get $\\frac{X}{4} = \\frac{1}{2^3} + \\frac{3}{2^5} + \\frac{5}{2^7} + \\dots$",
      "If we subtract $\\frac{X}{4}$ from $X$, we get $\\frac{3X}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{2^3} + \\frac{2}{2^5} + \\dots$",
      "We can write this as $\\frac{3X}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2^3} + \\frac{1}{2^5} + \\frac{1}{2^7} + \\dots\\right)$",
      "We can evaluate the sum in parentheses by using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series.",
      "That formula is $\\frac{a}{1-r}$ where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.",
      "In this case, the first term is $\\frac{1}{2^3}$ and the common ratio is $\\frac{1}{2^2}$, so the sum is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{2^3}}{1-\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2^3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{4}{2^3 * 3}$",
      "We can substitute that into the equation we derived earlier to get $\\frac{3X}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{4}{2^3 * 3}$.",
      "Simplifying the right-hand side, we get $\\frac{3X}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{8}{2^3 * 3} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{5}{6}$",
      "So $X = \\frac{5/6}{3/4} = \\frac{5}{6} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{5}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{10}{9}$."
