  "step": {
    "text": "The $x$-coordinate is negative and the $y$-coordinate is negative, so the point is in the third quadrant.",

      "Now, let's find the radius $r$. To do this, we'll need to find the distance between the point and the $z$-axis.",
      "This distance is just the square root of the sum of the squares of the $x$- and $y$- coordinates.",
      "In other words, $r=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.",
      "So in this case, $r=\\sqrt{(-2)^2+(-2\\sqrt{3})^2}$.",
      "That simplifies to $\\sqrt{4+12}$.",
      "And then $r=\\sqrt{16}$.",
      "So $r=4$. Now let's find $\\theta$.",
      "First, we need to see in which quadrant the point lies."
