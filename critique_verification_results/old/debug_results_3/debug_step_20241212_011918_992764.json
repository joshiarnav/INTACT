      "The determinant of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ is $ad - bc$.",
      "So the cofactor of the first entry is $(x + y)^2 - xy = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - xy = x^2 + xy + y^2$.\nThe second entry is $x$, and its cofactor is\n\\[\\begin{vmatrix} 1 & y \\\\ 1 & x + y \\end{vmatrix}.\\]\nThis is a $2 \\times 2$ determinant, so its value is $(x + y) - y = x$.\nThe third entry is $y$, and its cofactor is\n\\[\\begin{vmatrix} 1 & x + y \\\\ 1 & x \\end{vmatrix}.\\]\nThis is also a $2 \\times 2$ determinant, so its value is $(x) - (x + y) = -y$."
