    "ground_truth_solution": "We write both sides with the same base, 5.  This gives us $5^{2r-3} = 5^2$.  Since the bases of both sides are the same, the exponents must be equal.  Therefore, we have $2r-3=2$, so $r=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$.",

      "25 can be written as $5^2$, so the equation becomes $5^{2r-3} = 5^2$.",
      "Now, since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal as well.",
      "This means that $2r-3 = 2$, which is a linear equation that can be solved for $r$.",
      "Adding 3 to both sides, we get $2r = 5$.",
