When the tank is lying flat on its side (not on one of the circular ends), the oil inside is $3$ feet deep. How deep, in feet, would the oil have been if the tank had been standing upright on one of its bases? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",

We can find the length of half the base of the isosceles triangle by using the Pythagorean theorem on the smaller right triangle. Setting half the length of the base to $x$, we have $x^2+1=4$, so $x=\\sqrt{3}$ and the length of the base is $2\\sqrt3$. Therefore, we have that the area of the triangle is $\\frac12 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2\\sqrt3=\\sqrt3$. So, the area of the part of the circle that's covered in oil is $\\frac23 \\cdot 4\\pi + \\sqrt3=\\frac83\\pi+\\sqrt3$.\n\nThus, we have that the oil takes up $\\dfrac{\\frac83\\pi+\\sqrt3}{4\\pi} \\approx \\frac{10.11}{12.57} \\approx 0.805$ of the cylinder.\n\nWith the cylinder upright, the fraction of the cylinder the oil covers is the same as the fraction of the height the oil covers.

Moreover, if $143$ is not divisible by $3$, then $146$ and $149$ are not divisible by $3$ or any multiple of $3$, so $n = 6$ and $n = 9$ do not work.\n\nFor $n = 4$, we can see that $144$ is divisible by $4$ because $44$ is divisible by $4,$ so $n = 4$ works.\n\nFor $n = 7$, we can easily perform division and see that $147$ is divisible by $7,$ so $n = 7$ works.\n\nFor $n = 8$, we have little choice but to find that $\\dfrac{148}{8} = \\dfrac{37}{2},$ and so $n = 8$ does not work.\n\nAll in all, we have that $n$ can be $1,$ $2,$ $4,$ $5,$ or $7,$ so we have $\\boxed{5}$ possible choices for $n$ such that $14n$ is divisible by $n.$",

      "ground_truth_solution": "Once we've picked the first two digits of a $4$-digit palindrome, the last two digits are automatically chosen by mirroring the first two. Thus, we can make exactly one $4$-digit palindrome for every $2$-digit number. For example, the $2$-digit number $57$ gives the palindrome $5775$.\n\nFor an integer to be divisible by $3$, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by $3$. A $4$-digit palindrome has two identical pairs of digits. If the total of all four digits is a multiple of $3$, then the first two digits must also add up to a multiple of $3$ (since doubling a non-multiple of $3$ can't give us a multiple of $3$). Thus, to make a $4$-digit palindrome which is a multiple of $3$, we must use a $2$-digit number that is a multiple of $3$.\n\nThis tells us that the number of $4$-digit palindromes that are divisible by $3$ is identical to the number of multiples of $3$ from $10$ through $99$. Here is a list of those multiples of $3$: $$12, 15, 18, 21, 24, \\ldots, 90, 93, 96, 99.$$ This list consists of the $30$ positive multiples of $3$ greater than $10.$ So, there are $30$ numbers in the list, and therefore $\\boxed{30}$ four-digit palindromes that are divisible by $3$.\n\nHere is a list of those palindromes: $$1221, 1551, 1881, 2112, 2442, \\ldots, 9009, 9339, 9669, 9999.$$",

Then, if any absolute value equals 1, then $a_n=0$. Therefore, if either $|y-x|$ or $|z-y|$ is less than or equal to 1, then that ordered triple meets the criteria. Assume that to be the only way the criteria is met. To prove, let $|y-x|>1$, and $|z-y|>1$. Then, $a_4 \\ge 2z$, $a_5 \\ge 4z$, and $a_6 \\ge 4z$. However, since the minimum values of $a_5$ and $a_6$ are equal, there must be a scenario where the criteria was met that does not meet our earlier scenarios. Calculation shows that to be $z=1$, $|y-x|=2$. Again assume that any other scenario will not meet criteria. To prove, divide the other scenarios into two cases: $z>1$, $|y-x|>1$, and $|z-y|>1$; and $z=1$, $|y-x|>2$, and $|z-y|>1$. For the first one, $a_4 \\ge 2z$, $a_5 \\ge 4z$, $a_6 \\ge 8z$, and $a_7 \\ge 16z$, by which point we see that this function diverges. For the second one, $a_4 \\ge 3$, $a_5 \\ge 6$, $a_6 \\ge 18$, and $a_7 \\ge 54$, by which point we see that this function diverges.\nTherefore, the only scenarios where $a_n=0$ is when any of the following are met: $|y-x|<2$ (280 options) $|z-y|<2$ (280 options, 80 of which coincide with option 1) $z=1$, $|y-x|=2$.

So, we can find the probability that Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's, subtract it from 1, and divide by 2 to find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's. There are three ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's: he can roll two of each, one of each, or none of each. If he rolls two of each, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which two dice roll the 1's. If he rolls one of each, there are $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1}=12$ ways to choose which dice are the 6 and the 1, and for each of those ways there are $4\\cdot4=16$ ways to choose the values of the other dice. If Greg rolls no 1's or 6's, there are $4^4=256$ possible values for the dice. In total, there are $6+12\\cdot16+256=454$ ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's. There are $6^4=1296$ total ways the four dice can roll, so the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\left(1-\\dfrac{454}{1296}\\right)=\\boxed{\\dfrac{421}{1296}}$.",
