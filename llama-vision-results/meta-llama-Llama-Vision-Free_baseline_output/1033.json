    "problem": "My school's math club has 6 boys and 8 girls.  I need to select a team to send to the state math competition.  We want 6 people on the team.  In how many ways can I select the team to have more girls than boys?",
    "solution": "We do this problem with three cases.\n\nCase 1: 4 girls, 2 boys on the team.\n\nWith 4 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$ ways to pick the girls, and $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to pick the boys, for a total of $70 \\times 15 = 1050$.\n\nCase 2: 5 girls, 1 boy on the team.  With 5 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{5} = 56$ ways to pick the girls, and $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to pick the boy, for a total of $56 \\times 6 = 336$.\n\nCase 3: 6 girls on the team. With 6 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{6} = 28$ ways to pick the girls on the team.\n\nThis gives us a sum of $1050 + 336 + 28 = \\boxed{1414}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of girls and boys required for the team to have more girls than boys.\nTo have more girls than boys in the team, we need to select at least 4 girls.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of boys that can be selected in each case.\nIf we select 4 girls, we can select at most 2 boys, so we can select 1, 2 boys. If we select 5 girls, we can select at most 1 boy, so we can select 1 boy. If we select 6 girls, we can select 0 boys.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to select the team with 4 girls and 2 boys.\nThe number of ways to select 4 girls from 8 girls is $\\binom{8}{4} = \\frac{8!}{4!4!} = 70$, and the number of ways to select 2 boys from 6 boys is $\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!4!} = 15$. Therefore, the number of ways to select the team with 4 girls and 2 boys is $70 \\times 15 = 1050$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to select the team with 5 girls and 1 boy.\nThe number of ways to select 5 girls from 8 girls is $\\binom{8}{5} = \\frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56$, and the number of ways to select 1 boy from 6 boys is $\\binom{6}{1} = \\frac{6!}{1!5!} = 6$. Therefore, the number of ways to select the team with 5 girls and 1 boy is $56 \\times 6 = 336$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to select the team with 6 girls and 0 boys.\nThe number of ways to select 6 girls from 8 girls is $\\binom{8}{6} = \\frac{8!}{6!2!} = 28$, and there is only 1 way to select 0 boys from 6 boys.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of ways to select the team.\nThe total number of ways to select the team is the sum of the number of ways to select the team with 4 girls and 2 boys, 5 girls and 1 boy, and 6 girls and 0 boys. Therefore, the total number of ways to select the team is $1050 + 336 + 28 = 1414$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1414}$"
