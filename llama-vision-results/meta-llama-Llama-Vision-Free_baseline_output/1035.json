    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the number of distinguishable ways to write 9 as a sum of 1s, 2s, and 4s, where the order of the addends matters.\n\n## Step 2: Consider using stars and bars method\nWe can use the stars and bars method, but we need to be careful since the addends can be 1, 2, or 4. We can start by considering the number of 4s because it's the largest addend.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of 4s\nWe can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 4s, so let's consider each case separately.\n\n## Step 4: Case 1 - 0 4s\nIf we have 0 4s, then we need to write 9 as a sum of 1s and 2s. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to arrange 9 stars and 1 bar, where the stars represent 1s and the bar represents the transition between 1s and 2s. Using the stars and bars method, we get $\\binom{10}{1} = 10$ ways.\n\n## Step 5: Case 2 - 1 4s\nIf we have 1 4, then we need to write 5 as a sum of 1s and 2s. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to arrange 5 stars and 0 bars, where the stars represent 1s. Using the stars and bars method, we get $\\binom{5}{0} = 1$ way. However, we also need to add 4 to the sum, so we multiply by $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$ ways to arrange the 4 with the 1s and 2s. So, there are $4 \\times 1 = 4$ ways.\n\n## Step 6: Case 3 - 2 4s\nIf we have 2 4s, then we need to write 1 as a sum of 1s and 2s. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to arrange 1 star and 0 bars, where the star represents 1s. Using the stars and bars method, we get $\\binom{1}{0} = 1$ way. However, we also need to add 4 twice to the sum, so we multiply by $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways to arrange the 4s with the 1s and 2s. So, there are $3 \\times 1 = 3$ ways.\n\n## Step 7: Case 4 - 3 4s\nIf we have 3 4s, then we need to write 1 as a sum of 1s and 2s, which is not possible.\n\n## Step 8: Add up the possibilities\nNow, we add up the possibilities for each case: $10 + 4 + 3 = 17$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the final answer\nSince each of these possibilities can be arranged in $3! = 6$ ways, we multiply the total by 6 to get the final answer: $17 \\times 6 = 102$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{102}$"
