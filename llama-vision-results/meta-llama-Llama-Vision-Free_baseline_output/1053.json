    "problem": "If Michael rolls three fair dice, what is the probability that he will roll at least two 1's? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We calculate the complement, or the probability that Michael does not roll at least two 1's, and then subtract from 1.  If Michael does not roll at least two 1's, he must roll either zero or one.  The probability that he rolls no 1's is  $$\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6} = \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{216}$$The probability that he rolls one 1 is $$\\left(\\binom{3}{1}\\cdot\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\\cdot\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6} = \\binom{3}{1}\\left(\\frac{25}{216}\\right) = \\frac{75}{216},$$since we can choose which of the dice rolled a 1 in $\\binom{3}{1}$ ways.  Thus our answer is $1-\\frac{125}{216}-\\frac{75}{216} = \\frac{16}{216}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{27}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of outcomes when rolling three dice.\nWhen rolling three dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the total number of outcomes for three dice is $6^3 = 216$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to roll at least two 1's.\nTo find the number of ways to roll at least two 1's, we can calculate the number of ways to roll exactly two 1's and the number of ways to roll three 1's separately and then sum them up.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to roll exactly two 1's.\nTo roll exactly two 1's, we need to choose 2 out of the 3 dice to roll a 1. This can be done in $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ ways. For each of these ways, the remaining die can be any of the 5 other numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). Therefore, the total number of ways to roll exactly two 1's is $3 \\cdot 5 = 15$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to roll three 1's.\nThere is only one way to roll three 1's, which is when all three dice show a 1.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of ways to roll at least two 1's.\nThe total number of ways to roll at least two 1's is the sum of the number of ways to roll exactly two 1's and the number of ways to roll three 1's, which is $15 + 1 = 16$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of rolling at least two 1's.\nThe probability of rolling at least two 1's is the number of ways to roll at least two 1's divided by the total number of outcomes, which is $\\frac{16}{216}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction.\nThe fraction $\\frac{16}{216}$ can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8. This gives us $\\frac{2}{27}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{27}}$"
