    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of letters in the word ELLIPSE.\nThe word ELLIPSE has 7 letters.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the repeating letters in the word ELLIPSE.\nThe word ELLIPSE has 2 Es, 2 Ls, and 2 Is.\n\n## Step 3: Use the formula for permutations with repetition to calculate the number of ways to arrange the letters.\nThe formula for permutations with repetition is n! / (n1! * n2! * ... nk!), where n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the number of repetitions for each item. In this case, n = 7 (total number of letters), n1 = 2 (number of Es), n2 = 2 (number of Ls), n3 = 2 (number of Is), and n4 = 1 (number of Ps). Plugging in these values, we get 7! / (2! * 2! * 2!).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the factorial of 7.\n7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the factorial of 2.\n2! = 2 * 1 = 2.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the letters.\nThe number of ways to arrange the letters is 5040 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 5040 / 8 = 630.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{630}$"
