    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand that the problem is asking for the number of combinations\nThe coach needs to select 4 members out of 8, and the order in which she selects them does not matter.\n\n## Step 2: Use the combination formula to calculate the number of ways\nThe combination formula is given by C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to be chosen.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the values into the combination formula\nIn this case, n = 8 (total number of team members) and k = 4 (number of members to be selected).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the combination\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!(8-4)!) = 8! / (4!4!).\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression\n8! = 8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1, 4! = 4*3*2*1, so we can simplify the expression as:\nC(8, 4) = (8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((4*3*2*1)*(4*3*2*1)).\n\n## Step 6: Cancel out the common factors in the numerator and denominator\nThe (4*3*2*1) terms will cancel out, leaving us with:\nC(8, 4) = (8*7*6*5) / (4*3*2*1).\n\n## Step 7: Perform the multiplication\n(8*7*6*5) = 1680, and (4*3*2*1) = 24.\n\n## Step 8: Divide to find the final answer\nC(8, 4) = 1680 / 24 = 70.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{70}$"
