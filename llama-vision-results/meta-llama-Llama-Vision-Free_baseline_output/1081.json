    "problem": "Three couples go to the movie theater. They want to seat people together for maximum enjoyment, but instead they randomly file into a row with six seats. What is the probability that they sit in a socially optimal configuration, in which each person is sitting next to his or her partner?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to pick people to fill the first two seats, and 3 ways for those two people to be a couple, for a probability $3/15 = 1/5$ that the first two seats are a couple. If a couple is seated successfully, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to seat people in the next two seats, and 2 ways for those two people to be a couple (you could pick either of the two remaining couples), for a probability $2/6 = 1/3$ that those two seats are a couple. If the first two couples are seated successfully, the last two seats will be guaranteed to go to the last couple. So, the probability that everything goes right is $1/5 \\cdot 1/3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{15}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible seating configurations for the six people.\nTo find the total number of ways to seat the six people, we can use the formula for permutations of a set, which is given by n! (n factorial), where n is the number of items in the set. In this case, we have six people, so the total number of possible seating configurations is 6!.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways the six people can sit together in socially optimal configurations.\nSince we want each person to sit with their partner, we can think of the six people as three \"units\" of two people each. These units can be arranged in 3! ways, but within each unit, the two people can be arranged in 2! ways. However, since the question asks for the probability that the people sit together by couples, we must consider that the internal arrangement within each couple doesn't affect the social optimality, so we only consider the arrangement of the units as a whole.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability that the six people sit together in socially optimal configurations.\nTo find the probability, we divide the number of ways the people can sit together in socially optimal configurations by the total number of possible seating configurations.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of possible seating configurations (6!).\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways the six people can sit together in socially optimal configurations (3!).\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability.\nProbability = (Number of ways to sit together in optimal configurations) / (Total number of possible configurations) = 6 / 720.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the probability.\nProbability = 6 / 720 = 1 / 120.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{120}}$"
