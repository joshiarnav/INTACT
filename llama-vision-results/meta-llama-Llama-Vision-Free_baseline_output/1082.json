    "problem": "A restaurant offers three desserts, and exactly twice as many appetizers as main courses. A dinner consists of an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert. What is the least number of main courses that the restaurant should offer so that a customer could have a different dinner each night in the year 2003?",
    "solution": "Let $m$ denote the number of main courses needed to meet the requirement. Then the number of dinners available is $3\\cdot m \\cdot 2m = 6m^2$.  Thus $m^2$ must be at least $365/6 \\approx 61$.  Since $7^2 = 49<61<64 = 8^2$, $\\boxed{8}$ main courses is enough, but 7 is not.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of different dinners a customer could have in a year.\nIn the year 2003, there were 365 days. To ensure a customer could have a different dinner each night, the total number of different dinners must be at least 365.\n\n## Step 2: Express the number of appetizers in terms of the number of main courses.\nLet's denote the number of main courses as M. According to the problem, the restaurant offers exactly twice as many appetizers as main courses. Therefore, the number of appetizers is 2M.\n\n## Step 3: Express the total number of different dinners in terms of the number of main courses.\nEach dinner consists of an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert. The total number of different dinners is the product of the number of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Since there are 3 desserts, the total number of different dinners is 3M * 2M * 3 = 18M^2.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for the minimum number of main courses required to have at least 365 different dinners.\nTo find the minimum number of main courses, we need to solve the inequality 18M^2 >= 365.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the inequality 18M^2 >= 365 for M.\nDivide both sides of the inequality by 18 to isolate M^2: M^2 >= 365/18. Simplifying 365/18 gives approximately 20.28. Taking the square root of both sides of the inequality, we get M >= sqrt(20.28).\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the square root of 20.28 to determine the minimum number of main courses.\nThe square root of 20.28 is approximately 4.50.\n\n## Step 7: Round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that the number of dinners is at least 365.\nSince the number of main courses must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest integer to ensure the total number of different dinners is at least 365.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the final answer.\nThe minimum number of main courses required to ensure a customer can have a different dinner each night in the year 2003 is 5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
