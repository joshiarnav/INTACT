    "problem": "How many non-empty subsets of $\\{ 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 \\}$ consist entirely of prime numbers?  (We form a subset of the group of numbers by choosing some number of them, without regard to order.  So, $\\{1,2,3\\}$ is the same as $\\{3,1,2\\}$.)",
    "solution": "We consider the subset $\\{ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 \\}$ which consists only of the prime integers in the original set. Any subset consisting entirely of prime numbers must be a subset of this particular subset. And, there are $2^5 - 1 = \\boxed{31}$ non-empty subsets of this 5-element set, which we can easily see by making the choice of including or not including each element.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the prime numbers within the given set\nThe prime numbers within the set $\\{ 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 \\}$ are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of subsets\nTo find the total number of subsets, including the empty set, we can use the formula $2^n$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. Since there are 5 prime numbers, the total number of subsets is $2^5 = 32$.\n\n## Step 3: Subtract the empty set\nWe need to subtract 1 from the total number of subsets to exclude the empty set, as the problem asks for non-empty subsets.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{31}$"
