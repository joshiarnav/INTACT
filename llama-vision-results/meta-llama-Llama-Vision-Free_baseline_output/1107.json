    "problem": "If you flip a fair coin four times, what is the probability of flipping at least three heads in a row? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The quickest way to solve this problem is to count the number of outomes that have three heads in a row, as we already know very clearly that there are $2^4$ outcomes total. So, HHHH, HHHT, THHH are the only 3 outcomes that have three consecutive heads. So, our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{16}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and what is being asked.\nWe need to calculate the probability of getting at least three heads in a row when flipping a fair coin four times.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of outcomes for flipping a coin four times.\nSince each flip has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails), the total number of outcomes for four flips is $2^4 = 16$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the successful outcomes for getting at least three heads in a row.\nTo get at least three heads in a row, we can have either three heads in a row or four heads in a row. We need to calculate the number of ways each scenario can occur.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to get three heads in a row.\nThere are 3 ways to place the single tail among the sequence of three heads: HHTH, HTHH, and THHH.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to get four heads in a row.\nThere is only one way to get four heads in a row: HHHH.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of successful outcomes.\nThe total number of successful outcomes is the sum of the number of ways to get three heads in a row and the number of ways to get four heads in a row: $3 + 1 = 4$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability of getting at least three heads in a row.\nThe probability is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: $\\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$"
