    "problem": "The digits from 1 to 6 are arranged to form a six-digit multiple of 5. What is the probability that the number is greater than 500,000? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Of the digits 1 to 6, 5 must be the units digit since our number is a multiple of 5. We have five digits remaining, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, for five digit places. The number is greater than 500,000 if and only if the hundred thousands digit is 6. The probability that the hundred thousands digit (which can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6) is 6 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We need to determine the total number of arrangements of the digits 1 to 6 that form a six-digit multiple of 5.\n## Step 2:  Since a multiple of 5 must end in 0 or 5, we have two cases to consider.\n## Step 3:  In the first case, if the number ends in 0, the five remaining digits can be arranged in $5!$ ways.\n## Step 4:  In the second case, if the number ends in 5, the four remaining digits can be arranged in $4!$ ways.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the total number of arrangements is $5! + 4!$.\n## Step 6:  We are then asked to find the probability that the number is greater than 500,000.\n## Step 7:  To achieve this, we must arrange the digits 1 to 6 in such a way that the number starts with 5 and is greater than 500,000.\n## Step 8:  If the number starts with 5, the remaining 5 digits must be arranged in $5!$ ways, but we need to ensure that the second digit is greater than 5. Therefore, the second digit can be arranged in 3 ways (1, 2, or 3). The remaining 4 digits can then be arranged in $4!$ ways.\n## Step 9:  So, the number of arrangements starting with 5 and greater than 500,000 is $5! \\times 3$.\n## Step 10:  The probability is then given by the ratio of the number of successful arrangements to the total number of arrangements, which is $\\frac{5! \\times 3}{5! + 4!}$.\n## Step 11:  By simplifying the expression, we can obtain the final probability.\n\n## Step 12: Simplifying the expression $\\frac{5! \\times 3}{5! + 4!}$.\n## Step 13: We can rewrite $5!$ as $5 \\times 4!$.\n## Step 14: Substituting this into the expression, we get $\\frac{5 \\times 4! \\times 3}{5 \\times 4! + 4!}$.\n## Step 15: Cancelling out the $4!$ terms, we have $\\frac{5 \\times 3}{5 + 1}$.\n## Step 16: Simplifying the expression, we get $\\frac{15}{6}$.\n\n## Step 17: Further simplifying the fraction $\\frac{15}{6}$.\n## Step 18: We can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.\n## Step 19: Dividing $\\frac{15}{6}$ by 3, we get $\\frac{5}{2}$.\n\n## Step 20: We must simplify the fraction $\\frac{5}{2}$ further if possible.\n## Step 21: The fraction $\\frac{5}{2}$ is already in its simplest form.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$"
