    "problem": "What is the value of $82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3$?  (No calculators!  And see if you can do it in your head!)",
    "solution": "The given expression is the expansion of $(82+18)^3$.  In general, the cube of $(x+y)$ is \\[(x+y)^3 = 1x^3+3x^2y+3xy^2+1y^3.\\]The first and last terms in the given expression are cubes and the middle two terms both have coefficient 3, giving us a clue that this is a cube of a binomial and can be written in the form \\[(x+y)^3\\]In this case, $x=82$ and $y=18$, so our answer is\\[(82+18)^3\\ = 100^3 = \\boxed{1,\\!000,\\!000}\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are given the expression $82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3$, and we are asked to find its value without using calculators.\n## Step 2:  The expression looks complicated at first, but we can simplify it by recognizing a pattern. We observe that it resembles the expansion of $(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$.\n## Step 3:  By comparing the given expression with the expansion of $(a + b)^3$, we can see that $a = 82$ and $b = 18$.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, the given expression is equivalent to $(82 + 18)^3$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we can simplify this expression by finding the value of $82 + 18$, which is $100$.\n## Step 6:  Substituting $a = 82$ and $b = 18$ in the expansion of $(a + b)^3$, we get $(82 + 18)^3 = 82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3$.\n## Step 7:  Now, we can simply evaluate $(82 + 18)^3$, which is $(100)^3$.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the value of the expression $82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3$ is equal to $(100)^3 = 1000000$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1000000}$"
