    "problem": "A complete cycle of a traffic light takes 60 seconds. During each cycle the light is green for 25 seconds, yellow for 5 seconds, and red for 30 seconds. At a randomly chosen time, what is the probability that the light will NOT be green?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that it will be green is $\\frac{25}{60}=\\frac{5}{12}$. So the probability that it is not green is simply $1-\\frac{5}{12}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{12}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total duration of the entire cycle\nThe entire cycle of the traffic light takes 60 seconds.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the duration for which the light is green\nThe light is green for 25 seconds during each cycle.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability that the light will NOT be green\nThe probability that the light will NOT be green is calculated by subtracting the fraction of time the light is green from 1. This is because the light is either green or not green, and these are the only two possibilities. The fraction of time the light is green is 25/60, since it is green for 25 seconds out of the 60 seconds in the cycle.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the fraction\nTo simplify the fraction 25/60, divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5. This gives us 5/12.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that the light will NOT be green\nThe probability that the light will NOT be green is 1 - (5/12). This simplifies to (12/12 - 5/12), which is (7/12).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{12}}$"
