    "solution": "The total area of the target is $\\pi\\cdot 10^2=100\\pi$.  The area of the inner shaded region is the area of a circle with radius 4, and that is equal to $\\pi\\cdot 4^2=16\\pi$.  We can calculate the area of the shaded ring as the difference in areas of a circle with radius 8 and with radius 6.  This gives an area of $\\pi \\cdot 8^2 - \\pi \\cdot 6^2 = 28\\pi$.  The total shaded area is $16\\pi+28\\pi=44\\pi$.  The probability a dart will hit a shaded region is equal to $\\frac{44\\pi}{100\\pi}=\\boxed{\\frac{11}{25}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the probability of hitting a shaded region, we first need to understand the layout of the target.\nThe target consists of four concentric circles with radii 4 inches, 6 inches, 8 inches, and 10 inches.\n\n## Step 2: We need to determine the areas of the regions that are not shaded, as these will be subtracted from the total area to find the area of the shaded regions.\nThe unshaded regions are the areas of the circles with radii 4 inches, 6 inches, and 8 inches.\n\n## Step 3: The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.\nWe can calculate the areas of the unshaded regions using this formula.\n\n## Step 4: The area of the unshaded region for the circle with radius 4 inches is $\\pi(4^2) = 16\\pi$.\nSimilarly, the area of the unshaded region for the circle with radius 6 inches is $\\pi(6^2) = 36\\pi$, and the area of the unshaded region for the circle with radius 8 inches is $\\pi(8^2) = 64\\pi$.\n\n## Step 5: The total area of the unshaded regions is the sum of their individual areas, which is $16\\pi + 36\\pi + 64\\pi = 116\\pi$.\n\n## Step 6: The total area of the target is the area of the circle with radius 10 inches, which is $\\pi(10^2) = 100\\pi$.\n\n## Step 7: The area of the shaded region is the total area of the target minus the total area of the unshaded regions, which is $100\\pi - 116\\pi = -16\\pi$.\nHowever, we must find the area of the shaded region.\n\n## Step 8: Looking at the diagram, we can see that the shaded region is the area between the circle with radius 4 inches and the circle with radius 6 inches, and the area between the circle with radius 6 inches and the circle with radius 8 inches, and the area between the circle with radius 8 inches and the circle with radius 10 inches.\n\n## Step 9: The area between the circle with radius 4 inches and the circle with radius 6 inches is the area of the circle with radius 6 inches minus the area of the circle with radius 4 inches, which is $\\pi(6^2) - \\pi(4^2) = 36\\pi - 16\\pi = 20\\pi$.\n\n## Step 10: The area between the circle with radius 6 inches and the circle with radius 8 inches is the area of the circle with radius 8 inches minus the area of the circle with radius 6 inches, which is $\\pi(8^2) - \\pi(6^2) = 64\\pi - 36\\pi = 28\\pi$.\n\n## Step 11: The area between the circle with radius 8 inches and the circle with radius 10 inches is the area of the circle with radius 10 inches minus the area of the circle with radius 8 inches, which is $\\pi(10^2) - \\pi(8^2) = 100\\pi - 64\\pi = 36\\pi$.\n\n## Step 12: The total area of the shaded region is the sum of these three areas, which is $20\\pi + 28\\pi + 36\\pi = 84\\pi$.\n\n## Step 13: To find the probability of hitting the shaded region, we need to divide the area of the shaded region by the total area of the target.\n\n## Step 14: The probability of hitting the shaded region is $\\frac{84\\pi}{100\\pi} = \\frac{21}{25}$.\n\n## Step 15: Therefore, the probability of hitting a shaded region is $\\frac{21}{25}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{21}{25}}$"
