    "problem": "A Senate committee has 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats.  In how many ways can we form a subcommittee of 5 members that has at least one member from each party?",
    "solution": "There are a total of $\\binom{14}{5}=2002$ ways of selecting a subcommittee of 5 with no restrictions on the membership. Of these committees, the only ones that will violate the given condition are the ones that consist entirely of Republicans or entirely of Democrats. There are $\\binom{8}{5}=56$ possible subcommittees that have all 5 members selected from among the 8 Republicans and $\\binom{6}{5}=6$ possible subcommittees that have all 5 members selected from among the 6 Democrats. Subtracting the number of subcommittees that don't work from the total number of possible subcommittees gives us our answer: $2002-56-6=\\boxed{1940}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks us to determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a Senate committee consisting of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, such that the subcommittee has at least one member from each party.\n## Step 2:  To solve this problem, we can consider the total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 5 members from the entire committee, and then subtract the number of subcommittees that consist entirely of Republicans or entirely of Democrats.\n## Step 3:  The total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 5 members from the entire committee can be calculated using combinations, denoted as $\\binom{n}{r}$, which gives the number of ways to choose r elements from a set of n distinct elements without considering the order.\n## Step 4:  In this case, the total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 5 members from the entire committee of 14 members is given by $\\binom{14}{5}$.\n## Step 5:  Next, we calculate the number of subcommittees that consist entirely of Republicans or entirely of Democrats.\n## Step 6:  There are $\\binom{8}{5}$ ways to choose a subcommittee of 5 members from the 8 Republicans, and $\\binom{6}{5}$ ways to choose a subcommittee of 5 members from the 6 Democrats.\n## Step 7:  However, the problem asks for the number of subcommittees that have at least one member from each party, so we need to subtract the number of subcommittees that consist entirely of Republicans and Democrats from the total number of subcommittees.\n## Step 8:  This gives us the expression $\\binom{14}{5}-\\binom{8}{5}-\\binom{6}{5}$.\n## Step 9:  By simplifying this expression, we can find the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that has at least one member from each party.\n## Step 10:  We can simplify and calculate the combinations to get the final answer.\n\n## Step 11:  Calculating $\\binom{14}{5}$ gives us $2002$, and calculating $\\binom{8}{5}$ gives us $56$, and calculating $\\binom{6}{5}$ gives us $6$.\n\n## Step 12:  Now, we can substitute these values into the expression $\\binom{14}{5}-\\binom{8}{5}-\\binom{6}{5}$ to find the final answer.\n\n## Step 13:  The final expression becomes $2002-56-6$.\n\n## Step 14:  Simplifying the expression gives us $2002-62$.\n\n## Step 15:  This simplifies to $1940$.\n\n## Step 16:  Therefore, the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that has at least one member from each party is $1940$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1940}$"
