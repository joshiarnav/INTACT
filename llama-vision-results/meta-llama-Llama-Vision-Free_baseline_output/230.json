    "solution": "The number of three-point sets that can be chosen from the nine grid points is \\[\n\\binom{9}{3} = \\frac{9!}{3!\\cdot 6!} = 84.\n\\]Eight of these sets consist of three collinear points: 3 sets of points lie on vertical lines, 3 on horizontal lines, and 2 on diagonals. Hence the probability is $8/84 = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{21}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to identify the total number of possible three-point sets that can be chosen from the given grid.\n## Step 2:  The grid consists of 9 points, and we need to choose 3 points out of these 9 to form a set. This can be calculated using combinations, denoted as $\\binom{n}{r}$, which represents the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n distinct items without considering the order.\n## Step 3:  So, the total number of possible three-point sets is $\\binom{9}{3}=84$.\n## Step 4:  Next, we need to determine the number of sets of three points that lie on the same straight line.\n## Step 5:  We can observe that there are 8 such sets: 3 sets of 3 points in a row, 3 sets of 3 points in a column, and 2 sets of 3 points that are diagonally aligned.\n## Step 6:  Having identified the total number of sets and the number of sets that meet the condition, we can now calculate the probability of choosing a set of three points that lie on the same straight line.\n## Step 7:  The probability is given by the ratio of the number of sets of three points that lie on the same straight line to the total number of possible three-point sets, which is $\\frac{8}{84}=\\frac{2}{21}$.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the probability that the points lie on the same straight line is $\\frac{2}{21}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{21}}$"
