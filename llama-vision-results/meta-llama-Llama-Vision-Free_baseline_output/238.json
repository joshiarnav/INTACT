    "solution": "There are $8!$ ways to place the people around the table, but this counts each valid arrangement 4 times (if you move each person 2, 4, or 6 places clockwise you get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{8!}{4} = \\boxed{10080}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of people seated at each side of the table\nThere are 8 people to be seated, and they are arranged around a square table with 2 people on a side. Therefore, 4 people will sit at each side of the table.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to arrange 4 people at one side of the table\nThe number of ways to choose 4 people out of 8 is given by the combination formula: C(8, 4) = 8! / (4! * (8-4)!) = 70.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of arrangements of 4 people at each side of the table\nOnce the 4 people are chosen to sit at one side of the table, there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange them.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of arrangements for all 4 sides of the table\nSince we have 4 sides to the table, and the arrangements at each side are independent, we multiply the number of arrangements for one side by itself 4 times: 70 * 24 * 24 * 24 = 12441600.\n\n## Step 5: Account for the rotational symmetry of the table\nThe problem states that two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another. There are 4 sides to the table, so each arrangement has 4 equivalent rotations. To account for this, we divide the total number of arrangements by 4: 12441600 / 4 = 3109040.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the fraction (if necessary)\nNo simplification is necessary for this problem.\n\n## Step 7: Write the final answer in the required format.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3109040}$"
