    "problem": "A fisherman can see seven aquatic creatures in a lake --- four crocodiles, a catfish, and two giant squid. If he does not wish to fish two crocodiles consecutively, in how many orders can he catch all seven creatures? (Individuals from the same species are indistinguishable.)",
    "solution": "The crocodiles must be separated from each other by one of the other creatures, so he must catch them first, third, fifth, and seventh. For the second, fourth, and sixth slots, there are $3!$ ways to arrange the remaining three creatures.\n\nHowever, there are two giant squid, so we must divide by $2!$, the number of ways to arrange the squid.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{3!}{2!}=\\boxed{3}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to arrange the seven aquatic creatures without any restrictions.\nThere are 7! ways to arrange 7 creatures, but since the four crocodiles are indistinguishable, we must divide by 4! to account for the overcounting. Similarly, we must divide by 2! to account for the indistinguishability of the two giant squid. This gives us a total of $\\frac{7!}{4!2!}$ ways to arrange the creatures without any restrictions.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the creatures with two crocodiles together.\nIf we consider the two crocodiles as a single entity, we now have six entities in total: four crocodiles, one catfish, one giant squid, and the group of two crocodiles. These six entities can be arranged in 6! ways, but since the four crocodiles are indistinguishable, we must divide by 4! to account for the overcounting. This gives us a total of $\\frac{6!}{4!}$ ways to arrange the creatures with two crocodiles together.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to catch all seven creatures without fishing two crocodiles consecutively.\nTo find the number of ways to catch all seven creatures without fishing two crocodiles consecutively, we subtract the number of ways to arrange the creatures with two crocodiles together from the total number of ways to arrange the creatures without any restrictions. This gives us $\\frac{7!}{4!2!} - \\frac{6!}{4!}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression.\nWe can simplify the expression by expanding the factorials and canceling out common terms. $\\frac{7!}{4!2!} - \\frac{6!}{4!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4!}{4!2!} - \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4!}{4!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{2} - 6 \\times 5 = 105 - 30$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the final result.\n$105 - 30 = 75$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{75}$"
