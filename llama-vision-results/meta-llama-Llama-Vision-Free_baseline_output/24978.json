    "problem": "In a class of 20 students, all but 4 of the students put their names on a typed assignment. If the teacher randomly guesses, what is the probability that she correctly guesses which paper belongs to each of the four remaining students? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that the teacher guesses the first student's paper correctly is $\\frac{1}{4}$.  Given that the first guess is correct, the probability that she guesses the second student's paper correctly is $\\frac{1}{3}$.  Given that both of the first two guesses were correct, the probability that she guesses the third student's paper correctly is $\\frac{1}{2}$.  If the first three are correct, then the fourth will be correct with probability $1$.  The probability that all four guesses will be correct is $\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{24}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of ways the teacher can guess the papers of the 4 remaining students.\n## Step 2:  Since the teacher is guessing the papers randomly, for each of the 4 students, there are 16 possible papers that the teacher can pick.\n## Step 3:  This means that for the first student, there are 16 possible papers to choose from, for the second student, there are 15 remaining papers, for the third student, there are 14 remaining papers, and for the fourth student, there are 13 remaining papers.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, the total number of ways the teacher can guess the papers of the 4 remaining students is $16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we need to find the number of ways in which the teacher can correctly guess the papers of the 4 remaining students.\n## Step 6:  There is only one correct way for the teacher to guess the papers, as each student's paper is unique.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the number of ways in which the teacher can correctly guess the papers is 1.\n## Step 8:  Now, we can calculate the probability that the teacher correctly guesses which paper belongs to each of the four remaining students by dividing the number of ways in which the teacher can correctly guess the papers by the total number of ways the teacher can guess the papers.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the probability is $\\dfrac{1}{16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13}$.\n\n## Step 10:  Now, we can simplify the fraction to its lowest terms.\n## Step 11:  The numerator is 1, and the denominator is $16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13$.\n## Step 12:  We can simplify the denominator by finding the prime factorization of each number and cancelling out any common factors.\n## Step 13:  The prime factorization of 16 is $2^4$, the prime factorization of 15 is $3 \\times 5$, the prime factorization of 14 is $2 \\times 7$, and the prime factorization of 13 is 13.\n## Step 14:  The denominator is therefore $2^4 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 2 \\times 7 \\times 13 = 2^5 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 13$.\n## Step 15:  The numerator is 1, which does not have any prime factors.\n## Step 16:  Therefore, the simplified fraction is $\\dfrac{1}{2^5 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 13}$.\n\n## Step 17:  We can further simplify the fraction by reducing the power of 2 in the denominator to its lowest exponent.\n## Step 18:  The power of 2 in the denominator is 5, which can be reduced to 1 by dividing the numerator and denominator by $2^4$.\n## Step 19:  Therefore, the simplified fraction is $\\dfrac{1}{2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 13}$.\n\n## Step 20:  We can now calculate the product of the numbers in the denominator.\n## Step 21:  The product of 2, 3, 5, 7, and 13 is $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 13 = 2730$.\n## Step 22:  Therefore, the simplified fraction is $\\dfrac{1}{2730}$.\n\n## Step 23:  We can further simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor of the numerator and denominator.\n## Step 24:  The greatest common factor of 1 and 2730 is 1.\n## Step 25:  Since the greatest common factor is 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13} = \\dfrac{1}{2730}}$"
