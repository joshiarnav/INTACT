    "problem": "A box contains exactly five chips, three red and two white. Chips are randomly removed one at a time without replacement until all the red chips are drawn or all the white chips are drawn. What is the probability that the last chip drawn is white?",
    "solution": "Think of continuing the drawing until all five chips are removed from the box. There are ten possible orderings of the colors: RRRWW, RRWRW, RWRRW, WRRRW, RRWWR, RWRWR, WRRWR, RWWRR, WRWRR, and WWRRR. The six orderings that end in R represent drawings that would have ended when the second white chip was drawn. Therefore, the probability that the last chip drawn is white if we stop at the last red or the last white is $6/10 = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}.$\n\nOR\n\nImagine drawing until only one chip remains. If the remaining chip is red, then that draw would have ended when the second white chip was removed. The remaining chip will be red with probability $3/5,$ which means that the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$ that the last chip drawn from the box is white.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem and the possible outcomes\nWe need to calculate the probability that the last chip drawn from the box is white. The box contains 3 red chips and 2 white chips. Since chips are drawn without replacement until all the red chips are drawn or all the white chips are drawn, the possible outcomes are related to the sequence of draws that lead to the last chip being white.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the scenarios that lead to drawing a white chip last\nThere are several scenarios that lead to drawing a white chip last. These include sequences where a white chip is drawn first but eventually a white chip is the last one, or where chips are drawn in a way that delays the last white chip until the end.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the total number of possible orders in which the chips can be drawn\nSince there are 5 chips in total (3 red and 2 white), the total number of possible orders to draw the 5 chips is a permutation of 5 items, which is calculated as 5! (5 factorial), but because we're interested in the order of reds and whites specifically, the total number of possible orders to draw the 5 chips until one color is left is 2! for the order of the two colors, multiplied by the permutations within each color group, which is 3! for the reds and 2! for the whites.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of outcomes where the last chip is white\nFor the last chip to be white, all 3 red chips must be drawn before the last white chip. This involves considering the ways to arrange the red and white chips such that the white chip is the last one drawn. There are permutations of the red chips (3!) and the first 4 draws can be any combination of red and white that ensures a white chip is drawn last.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability\nThe probability of drawing a white chip last is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of outcomes\nThe total number of outcomes is the permutations of the reds and whites which we've determined to be 3! * 2! * 2! (since there are 2 colors and within each color there are different permutations). The number of favorable outcomes can be calculated considering that the last chip must be a white chip, thus the total permutations in which the last chip can be white is 3! * 2! (since there are 3! permutations of the red chips and 2! permutations of the white chips to be drawn first).\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability that the last chip drawn is white\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Given that we want the last chip to be white, and we consider the permutations of the red and white chips, the number of favorable outcomes is 3! * 2! because we just need to ensure the last chip is white, and the red chips can be arranged in 3! ways, and the first white chip can be arranged in 2! ways.\n\n## Step 8: Perform the calculations\nThe total number of outcomes is 3! * 2! * 2! = 6 * 2 * 2 = 24.\nThe number of favorable outcomes is 3! * 2! = 6 * 2 = 12.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the probability\nThe probability that the last chip drawn is white is 12 / 24 = 1/2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$"
