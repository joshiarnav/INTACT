    "solution": "By the Binomial Theorem, we have  \\begin{align*}\n301^4 &= (3(100) + 1)^4\\\\\n&= \\binom40 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 100^4 \\cdot 1^0 + \\binom41 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 100^3 \\cdot 1^1 \\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad+ \\binom42 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 100^2 \\cdot 1^2+ \\binom43 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 100^1 \\cdot 1^3 \\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad+ \\binom44 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 100^0 \\cdot 1^4.\n\\end{align*} All but the last two terms are divisible by $10000=100^2$, so we only have to consider the remainder when the last two terms are divided by 10,000. The last two terms are  \\begin{align*}\n\\binom43 &\\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 100^1 \\cdot 1^3 + \\binom44 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 100^0 \\cdot 1^4\\\\\n&= 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1\\\\\n& = 1200 + 1 = \\boxed{1201}.\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and what is required\nWe need to find the remainder when $301^4$ is divided by 10,000.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the approach to solve the problem\nSince we're dealing with finding a remainder when a number is divided by 10,000, we can use modular arithmetic, which allows us to focus on the last four digits of the number. We can also apply the properties of modular arithmetic, including the fact that $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \\equiv b^c \\pmod{m}$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply modular arithmetic to simplify the problem\nWe can simplify $301^4$ by finding an equivalent expression modulo 10,000. First, we can break down 301 into its last two digits, which are 01. Since $01^4 = 1$, we can express $301^4$ as $1^4$, which will be useful for simplifying the calculation.\n\n## Step 4: Use the fact that $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \\equiv b^c \\pmod{m}$ to rewrite $301^4$\nSince $301 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$, we have $301^4 \\equiv 1^4 \\pmod{100}$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the remainder when $301^4$ is divided by 10,000\nNow, we can see that $1^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$, implying that the remainder when $301^4$ is divided by 10,000 is 1.\n\n## Step 6: Write the final answer\nTherefore, the remainder when $301^4$ is divided by 10,000 is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
