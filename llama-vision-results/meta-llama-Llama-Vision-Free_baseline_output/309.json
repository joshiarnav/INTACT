    "problem": "A team averages 7 losses for every 13 games it wins. If ties are not permitted, what is the probability that the team will win its next game? Express your answer as a percent.",
    "solution": "If a team averages 7 losses for 13 wins, that means the team wins 13 out of 20 games, and $\\frac{13}{20} = .65$, or $\\boxed{65\\%}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the ratio of losses to wins\nThe team averages 7 losses for every 13 games it wins, which gives us a ratio of losses to wins of 7:13.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of games in the ratio\nThe total number of games in the ratio is 7 + 13 = 20.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the probability of winning\nThe probability of winning is the number of games won divided by the total number of games in the ratio, which is 13/20.\n\n## Step 4: Convert the probability to a percent\nTo convert the probability to a percent, we multiply by 100: (13/20) * 100 = 65%.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{65}$"
