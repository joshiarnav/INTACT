    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Count the number of unit triangles in the original triangle.\nIn the original triangle, there are 3 rows, and each row has 3 unit triangles (since they are unit triangles), so there are a total of $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ unit triangles.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of triangles in each new row.\nIf we add three more rows to the bottom of this triangle, with each row having 2 more unit triangles than the previous row, then the first new row will have 5 unit triangles, the second new row will have 7 unit triangles, and the third new row will have 9 unit triangles.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of unit triangles in the new rows.\nThe first new row has 5 unit triangles, the second new row has 7 unit triangles, and the third new row has 9 unit triangles, so the total number of unit triangles in the new rows is $5 + 7 + 9 = 21$.\n\n## Step 4: Add the unit triangles from the original triangle to the new rows to find the total number of unit triangles.\nAdding the total number of unit triangles from the original triangle (9) to the total number of unit triangles in the new rows (21), we get $9 + 21 = 30$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$"
