    "problem": "What is the greatest positive integer $n$ such that $3^n$ is a factor of $200!$?",
    "solution": "If we want the largest such $n$, we must count the number of factors of 3 in the prime factorization of $200!$. The number of multiples of 3 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3} \\right\\rfloor$.  (The notation $\\left\\lfloor x\\right\\rfloor$ means the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, so basically, $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ means ``divide 200 by 3 and round down.\")   However, these are not the only factors of 3 in the product!  Multiples of 9 in the product contribute an extra factor of 3. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{9} \\right\\rfloor$ of these, so we add this number to the $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ factors of 3 we found from counting multiples of 3.  Similarly, we must add in multiples of 27 once and multiples of 81.\n\nThe sum is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{9} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{27} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{81} \\right\\rfloor = 66 + 22 + 7 + 2 = \\boxed{97}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: We need to find the greatest positive integer $n$ such that $3^n$ is a factor of $200!$. To do this, we'll first determine how many factors of 3 are in 200!.\n\n## Step 2: To find the factors of 3 in 200!, we'll use the formula for finding the number of factors of a prime in a factorial, which is given by $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^3} \\right\\rfloor + ...$ until the quotient is less than 1, where $n$ is the factorial number and $p$ is the prime number.\n\n## Step 3: In this case, we'll use the formula with $n = 200$ and $p = 3$. We'll calculate the quotient $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3} \\right\\rfloor$, which is equal to 66.\n\n## Step 4: Next, we'll calculate the quotient $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3^2} \\right\\rfloor$, which is equal to 22.\n\n## Step 5: Now, we'll calculate the quotient $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3^3} \\right\\rfloor$, which is equal to 7.\n\n## Step 6: Since $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3^4} \\right\\rfloor$ is less than 1, we don't need to calculate this quotient.\n\n## Step 7: Adding up the quotients, we get $66 + 22 + 7 = 95$. This means that the greatest positive integer $n$ such that $3^n$ is a factor of $200!$ is 95.\n\n## Step 8: Therefore, the greatest positive integer $n$ such that $3^n$ is a factor of $200!$ is 95.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{95}$"
