    "problem": "A regular dodecahedron is a convex polyhedron with 12 regular pentagonal faces and 20 vertices.  If two distinct vertices are chosen at random, what is the probability that the line connecting them lies inside the dodecahedron?",
    "solution": "There are a total of $\\dbinom{20}{2}=190$ ways to choose two distinct vertices.  When the line is drawn connecting these vertices, some will correspond to edges or face diagonals, and the rest will lie inside the dodecahedron. Each of the 12 pentagonal faces has 5 edges.  This makes a total of $5\\cdot12=60$ edges.  This counts each edge twice, once for each adjacent face, so there are only $60/2=30$ edges.  Each of the 12 pentagonal faces also has $5$ face diagonals.  This can be seen by drawing out an example, or remembering that an $n$ sided polygon has $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$ face diagonals.  This is a total of $5\\cdot 12= 60$ face diagonals.\n\nTherefore, of the 190 ways to choose two vertices, $190-30-60=100$ will give lines that lie inside the dodecahedron when connected.  The probability of selecting such a pair is then: $$\\frac{100}{190}=\\boxed{\\frac{10}{19}}$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the probability that the line connecting two distinct vertices of a regular dodecahedron lies inside the dodecahedron, we first need to understand the total number of ways to choose two vertices from the dodecahedron.\n## Step 2:  A regular dodecahedron has 20 vertices, so the total number of ways to choose two distinct vertices is given by $\\binom{20}{2} = \\frac{20\\cdot19}{2} = 190$.\n## Step 3:  Next, we need to determine the number of pairs of vertices that lie on the same pentagonal face. Each pentagonal face has 5 vertices, so the number of pairs of vertices on the same face is $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$.\n## Step 4:  Additionally, there are 12 pentagonal faces in a dodecahedron, so the total number of pairs of vertices that lie on the same face is $12\\cdot 10 = 120$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we need to consider the number of pairs of vertices that lie on a non-adjacent pentagonal face. There are 30 edges, and each edge lies on 2 faces, so the total number of pairs of vertices that lie on non-adjacent faces is $30\\cdot 2 = 60$.\n## Step 6:  The only pairs of vertices that lie on the same edge are those that are adjacent, and there are 30 such pairs.\n## Step 7:  Now that we have the total number of pairs of vertices and the number of pairs that lie on the same edge, we can calculate the probability that the line connecting two distinct vertices lies inside the dodecahedron.\n## Step 8:  The probability is given by the ratio of the number of pairs of vertices that lie inside the dodecahedron to the total number of pairs of vertices. This is calculated as $(190-30-60)/190 = \\frac{100}{190} = \\frac{10}{19}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{10}{19}}$"
