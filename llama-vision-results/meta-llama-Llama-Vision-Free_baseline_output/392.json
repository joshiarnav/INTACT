    "problem": "Randy presses RAND on his calculator twice to obtain two random numbers between 0 and 1. Let $p$ be the probability that these two numbers and 1 form the sides of an obtuse triangle.  Find $4p$.",
    "solution": "Let the two random numbers be $x$ and $y$. In order to form an obtuse triangle, since 1 will be the longest side, we must simultaneously satisfy the following inequalities: $$x+y>1\\text{ and }x^2+y^2<1.$$The first is the triangle inequality and the second guarantees that the triangle is obtuse. Graphing these in the $xy$-plane, we get the following shaded region. [asy]\ndraw(unitsquare);\ndraw((0,0)--(1,0),EndArrow);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,1),EndArrow);\nlabel(\"0\",(0,0),SW);\nlabel(\"1\",(1,0),S);\nlabel(\"1\",(0,1),W);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,.5),W);\nfill((1,0)--(0,1)..(3/5,4/5)..cycle,gray(.7));\n[/asy] The curve is an arc of the unit circle centered at the origin. This area is then equal to that sector minus the right isosceles triangle within it, or $\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{\\pi-2}{4}.$ And since the area of the square is $1,$ $p = \\frac{\\pi-2}{4}.$\n\nFour times $p$ is $\\boxed{\\pi-2}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what it means for two numbers and 1 to form the sides of an obtuse triangle.\n## Step 2:  We recall that an obtuse triangle is a triangle in which one of the angles is greater than 90 degrees. Also, we know that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side.\n## Step 3:  Since the two numbers are obtained from RAND on the calculator, which generates random numbers between 0 and 1, we can represent these numbers as $a$ and $b$.\n## Step 4:  We need to ensure that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the length of the remaining side, and one of the angles is greater than 90 degrees.\n## Step 5:  The conditions for this are $a + b > 1$, $a + 1 > b$, and $b + 1 > a$. Additionally, we need to satisfy the condition that the square of the longest side is greater than the sum of the squares of the other two sides, which gives $max(a,b)^2 > 1^2 + min(a,b)^2$.\n## Step 6:  To simplify the problem and make it easier to analyze, we can consider the different cases for the values of $a$ and $b$.\n## Step 7:  We note that the order of $a$ and $b$ doesn't matter, so we can assume without loss of generality that $a < b$, and we only consider the region where $a < b$.\n## Step 8:  The condition $a + b > 1$ restricts the region to the area below the line $y = -x + 2$, and the conditions $a + 1 > b$ and $b + 1 > a$ restrict the region to the area below the lines $y = -x + 1$ and $y = x$.\n## Step 9:  We can visualize the area where the conditions are satisfied by graphing the lines $y = -x + 2$, $y = -x + 1$, and $y = x$ on a coordinate plane.\n## Step 10:  By plotting these lines, we can identify the region that satisfies all the conditions for forming an obtuse triangle.\n## Step 11:  We can see that the shaded region is the area where all the conditions are satisfied, and we need to find the area of this region.\n## Step 12:  The area of the shaded region can be calculated as the area of the triangle formed by the points $(0,1)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1/2,1/2)$, which is $\\frac{3}{8}$.\n## Step 13:  Since the total area of the sample space is 1 (a unit square), we can calculate the probability $p$ by taking the area of the shaded region divided by the total area.\n## Step 14:  Therefore, the probability $p$ is $\\frac{3}{8}$, and $4p = 4 \\times \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$"
