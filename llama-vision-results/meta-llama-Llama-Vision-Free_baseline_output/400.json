    "problem": "I have a spinner that lands on 1 with a probability of $\\frac{1}{10}$, 2 with a probability of $\\frac{2}{10}$, 3 with a probability of $\\frac{3}{10}$, and 4 with a probability of $\\frac{4}{10}$. If Phil and Sarah both spin the spinner, what is the probability that they get the same number?",
    "solution": "This problem requires a little bit of casework.  There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's. The probability of getting a 1 is $\\dfrac{1}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 1 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{100}$. Similarly, the probability of getting a 2 is $\\dfrac{2}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 2 is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{100}$, the probability of getting a 3 is $\\dfrac{3}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 3 is $\\left(\\dfrac{3}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{9}{100}$ and the probability of getting a 4 is $\\dfrac{4}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 4 is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{16}{100}$. So our answer is $\\dfrac{1}{100}+\\dfrac{4}{100}+\\dfrac{9}{100}+\\dfrac{16}{100}=\\frac{30}{100}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the probability of getting the same number for each possible outcome.\nTo get the same number, both Phil and Sarah can either both land on 1, both land on 2, both land on 3, or both land on 4.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability that both Phil and Sarah land on 1.\nThe probability of Phil landing on 1 is $\\frac{1}{10}$, and the probability of Sarah landing on 1 is also $\\frac{1}{10}$. Therefore, the probability that both Phil and Sarah land on 1 is $\\frac{1}{10} \\cdot \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{100}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability that both Phil and Sarah land on 2.\nThe probability of Phil landing on 2 is $\\frac{2}{10}$, and the probability of Sarah landing on 2 is also $\\frac{2}{10}$. Therefore, the probability that both Phil and Sarah land on 2 is $\\frac{2}{10} \\cdot \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{4}{100}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that both Phil and Sarah land on 3.\nThe probability of Phil landing on 3 is $\\frac{3}{10}$, and the probability of Sarah landing on 3 is also $\\frac{3}{10}$. Therefore, the probability that both Phil and Sarah land on 3 is $\\frac{3}{10} \\cdot \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{9}{100}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that both Phil and Sarah land on 4.\nThe probability of Phil landing on 4 is $\\frac{4}{10}$, and the probability of Sarah landing on 4 is also $\\frac{4}{10}$. Therefore, the probability that both Phil and Sarah land on 4 is $\\frac{4}{10} \\cdot \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{16}{100}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total probability that Phil and Sarah get the same number.\nThe total probability that Phil and Sarah get the same number is the sum of the probabilities of each possible outcome: $\\frac{1}{100} + \\frac{4}{100} + \\frac{9}{100} + \\frac{16}{100} = \\frac{30}{100}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction.\n$\\frac{30}{100}$ can be simplified to $\\frac{3}{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$"
