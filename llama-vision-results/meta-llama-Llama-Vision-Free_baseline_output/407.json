    "model_solution": "## Step 1: The problem requires finding the coefficient of $x^2y^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^4+(x+2y)^4$. To solve this, we need to expand both expressions separately.\n\n## Step 2: First, let's expand $(x+y)^4$. According to the binomial theorem, the expansion of $(x+y)^4$ is given by $\\binom{4}{0}x^4y^0 + \\binom{4}{1}x^3y^1 + \\binom{4}{2}x^2y^2 + \\binom{4}{3}x^1y^3 + \\binom{4}{4}x^0y^4$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplifying each term in the expansion of $(x+y)^4$, we get $1x^4+4x^3y+6x^2y^2+4xy^3+1y^4$.\n\n## Step 4: Next, let's expand $(x+2y)^4$ using the binomial theorem. The expansion of $(x+2y)^4$ is given by $\\binom{4}{0}x^4(2y)^0 + \\binom{4}{1}x^3(2y)^1 + \\binom{4}{2}x^2(2y)^2 + \\binom{4}{3}x^1(2y)^3 + \\binom{4}{4}x^0(2y)^4$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplifying each term in the expansion of $(x+2y)^4$, we get $1x^4+8x^3y+24x^2y^2+32xy^3+16y^4$.\n\n## Step 6: To find the coefficient of $x^2y^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^4$, we already have it as 6 from the previous step.\n\n## Step 7: To find the coefficient of $x^2y^2$ in the expansion of $(x+2y)^4$, we also already have it as 24 from the previous step.\n\n## Step 8: The coefficient of $x^2y^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^4+(x+2y)^4$ is the sum of the coefficients of $x^2y^2$ in the expansions of $(x+y)^4$ and $(x+2y)^4$.\n\n## Step 9: Therefore, the coefficient of $x^2y^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^4+(x+2y)^4$ is $6+24=30$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$"
