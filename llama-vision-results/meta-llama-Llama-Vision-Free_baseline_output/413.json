    "problem": "We roll a fair 6-sided die 5 times.  What is the probability that exactly 3 of the 5 rolls are either a 1 or a 2?",
    "solution": "The number of possible rolls of 5 dice is $6^5$, since there are 6 possibilities for each of the 5 dice.  Now we count the number of ways to get a 1 or a 2 in exactly 3 of the 5 rolls. First, we pick which 3 of the 5 rolls are 1 or 2: we can do that in $\\binom{5}{3}$ ways.  Now for each of these 3 rolls, there are 2 choices, and for each of the other 2 rolls, there are 4 choices.  Thus the probability is \\[\\frac{\\binom{5}{3}2^34^2}{6^5}=\\boxed{\\frac{40}{243}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, we need to determine the probability of rolling a 1 or 2 on a fair 6-sided die.\n## Step 2:  Since the die is fair, the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6, and the probability of rolling a 2 is also 1/6.\n## Step 3:  Since these are mutually exclusive events (you can't roll both a 1 and a 2 in the same roll), we can add the probabilities together to get the total probability of rolling a 1 or a 2, which is 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3.\n## Step 4:  Next, we need to calculate the probability of exactly 3 out of 5 rolls being either a 1 or a 2.\n## Step 5:  This can be calculated using the binomial probability formula, which is given by P(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * ((1-p)^(n-k)), where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successful trials, nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n## Step 6:  In this case, we have n = 5 (5 rolls), k = 3 (3 rolls that are either a 1 or a 2), and p = 1/3 (the probability of rolling a 1 or a 2).\n## Step 7:  First, we need to calculate the number of combinations of 5 items taken 3 at a time, which is given by 5C3 = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 5! / (3! * 2!) = (5*4) / (2*1) = 10.\n## Step 8:  Now, we can plug in the values into the binomial probability formula to get P(X = 3) = (10) * ((1/3)^3) * ((2/3)^(5-3)) = 10 * (1/27) * (4/9) = 40/243.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the probability that exactly 3 of the 5 rolls are either a 1 or a 2 is 40/243.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{40}{243}}$"
