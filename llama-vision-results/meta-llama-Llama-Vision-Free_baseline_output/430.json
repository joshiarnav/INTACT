    "problem": "Bob and Alice each have a bag that contains one ball of each of the colors,  blue, green, orange, red, and violet. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Bob then randomly selects one ball from his bag and  puts it into Alice's bag. What is the probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same?",
    "solution": "After Alice puts the ball into Bob's bag, his bag will contain six balls: two of one color and one of each of the other colors. After Bob selects a ball and places it into Alice's bag, the two bags will have the same contents if and only if Bob picked one of the two balls in his bag that are the same color. Because there are six balls in the bag when Bob makes his selection, the probability of selecting one of the same colored pair is $2/6=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the total number of outcomes for the first draw\nThe first step is to determine the total number of outcomes when Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag. Since there are 5 distinct colors, and she selects one ball at random, there are 5 possible outcomes for this first draw.\n\n## Step 2: Define the total number of outcomes for the second draw\nThe next step is to determine the total number of outcomes when Bob randomly selects one ball from his bag. Again, since there are 5 distinct colors, and Bob selects one ball at random, there are 5 possible outcomes for this second draw.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of outcomes for the entire process\nTo find the total number of outcomes for the entire process, we multiply the total number of outcomes for the first draw by the total number of outcomes for the second draw. This gives us a total of $5 \\times 5 = 25$ possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the successful outcomes for the first draw\nFor the contents of the two bags to be the same after the process, the first ball Alice selects must be a ball that, when placed in Bob's bag, allows Bob to select a ball of the same color on his second draw. This means Alice must select any ball other than the ball that would match the color of a ball Bob has in his bag. Since each bag contains one ball of each color, this means Alice has 4 successful options for the first draw.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the successful outcomes for the second draw\nFor the second draw, given that Alice has already placed a ball into Bob's bag, Bob has only 1 successful option to match the color of the ball Alice has in her bag. This is because he must select a ball that is the same color as the one Alice has selected, which was placed in his bag.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of successful outcomes for the entire process\nThe total number of successful outcomes for the entire process is the product of the number of successful outcomes for the first draw and the number of successful outcomes for the second draw. This gives us a total of $4 \\times 1 = 4$ successful outcomes.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability of the contents of the bags being the same\nThe probability of the contents of the two bags being the same after the process is the ratio of the total number of successful outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. This gives us a probability of $\\frac{4}{25}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{25}}$"
