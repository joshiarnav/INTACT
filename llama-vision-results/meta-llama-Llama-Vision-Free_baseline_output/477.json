    "problem": "In how many ways can 8 people sit around a round table if Pierre and Thomas want to sit together, but Rosa doesn't want to sit next to either of them? (Treat rotations as not distinct but reflections as distinct.)",
    "solution": "Solution 1: We choose any seat for Pierre, and then seat everyone else relative to Pierre.  There are 2 choices for Thomas; to the right or left of Pierre.  Then, there are 4 possible seats for Rosa that aren't adjacent to Pierre or Thomas. The five remaining people can be arranged in any of $5!$ ways, so there are a total of $2\\cdot 4\\cdot 5!=960$ valid ways to arrange the people around the table.\n\nSolution 2: The total number of ways in which Pierre and Thomas sit together is $6! \\cdot 2 = 1440$. The number of ways in which Pierre and Thomas sit together and Rosa sits next to one of them is $5! \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 480$. So the answer is the difference $1440 - 480 = \\boxed{960}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem\nPierre and Thomas want to sit together, so they can be considered as a single unit, and we will treat them as one entity. Rosa, however, does not want to sit next to either of them, which means she can sit next to the unit of Pierre and Thomas but not directly next to either of the two individuals.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the 3 entities around the table\nSince there are 3 entities (the unit of Pierre and Thomas, Rosa, and the 6 other people), we need to consider the arrangement of these entities around the round table. We can arrange 3 entities around a round table in (3-1)! = 2! = 2 ways.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the people within the unit of Pierre and Thomas\nWithin the unit of Pierre and Thomas, there are 2 people, and they can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the other 6 people\nThe 6 other people can be arranged among themselves in 6! = 720 ways.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of ways to arrange the people\nTo calculate the total number of ways to arrange the people, we need to multiply the number of ways to arrange the entities, the number of ways to arrange the people within the unit of Pierre and Thomas, and the number of ways to arrange the other 6 people. This gives us 2 * 2 * 720 = 2880 ways.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the restriction that Rosa cannot sit next to Pierre or Thomas\nHowever, we need to consider that Rosa cannot sit next to Pierre or Thomas. In half of the arrangements, Rosa will sit next to Pierre and Thomas, so we need to remove these cases.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the people with Rosa sitting next to Pierre or Thomas\nWhen Rosa sits next to Pierre or Thomas, we can consider Pierre and Thomas as two separate individuals again. There are 8 people, and we can arrange 8 people around a round table in (8-1)! = 7! = 5040 ways. However, we need to consider the cases where Rosa sits next to either Pierre or Thomas. There are 2 ways to choose which person Rosa sits next to, and then there are 2 ways to arrange the other 7 people. However, we need to divide by 2 to account for the fact that we are treating rotations as not distinct. Therefore, there are 2 * 2 * 5040 / 2 = 20160 / 2 = 10080 ways to arrange the people with Rosa sitting next to Pierre or Thomas.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total number of valid ways to arrange the people\nTo calculate the total number of valid ways to arrange the people, we need to subtract the number of ways to arrange the people with Rosa sitting next to Pierre or Thomas from the total number of ways to arrange the people. This gives us 2880 - 10080/2 = 2880 - 5040 = -2160. However, this is incorrect. The correct calculation should be (2880 - 10080/2) / 2 = 2880 - 5040 = -2160. However, 2880 - 5040/2 is actually 2880 - 2520 = 360.\n\n## Step 9: Divide by 2 to account for reflections\nHowever, we need to divide the result by 2 to account for reflections. The correct result is (2880 - 5040/2) / 2 = 360 / 2 = 180.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{360}$"
