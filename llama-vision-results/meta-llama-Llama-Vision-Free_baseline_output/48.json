    "problem": "Krishanu and Shaunak each pick an integer at random between 1 and 10, inclusive. What is the probability that the product of their numbers is more than 10? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Since 10 is small for a product, we consider the complementary probability, that their product is at most 10. To do this, we count the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ with $mn\\le10$ ($m$ is Krishanu's number and $n$ is Shaunak's number). If $m=1$, there are 10 such pairs; if $m=2$, there are 5; if $m=3$ there are 3; if $m=4$ or $m=5$, there are 2, and if $m=6,7,8,9,10$ there is 1, for a total of $$10+5+3+2+2+1+1+1+1+1=27$$ordered pairs with product at most 10. The probability one of these is picked is then $27/100$, since there are $10\\cdot10=100$ possible ordered pairs. Therefore, the probability that the product of their numbers is greater than 10 is $1-27/100=\\boxed{\\frac{73}{100}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the probability that the product of Krishanu and Shaunak's numbers is more than 10, we first need to understand the possible outcomes when both of them pick an integer at random between 1 and 10, inclusive.\n## Step 2:  We can start by calculating the total number of possible pairs of integers between 1 and 10, which is simply 10 * 10 = 100, as each person has 10 options.\n## Step 3:  We then need to identify the pairs of integers whose product is not greater than 10. This includes pairs with products of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\n## Step 4:  To count these pairs, we can break it down based on the product of the two numbers. For a product of 1, there is only 1 possibility (1,1). For a product of 2, there are 10 possibilities (1,2), (2,1). For a product of 3, there are 20 possibilities (1,3), (3,1), (2,3), (3,2). For a product of 4, there are 20 possibilities (1,4), (4,1), (2,4), (4,2), (3,4), (4,3). For a product of 5, there are 16 possibilities (1,5), (5,1), (2,5), (5,2), (3,5), (5,3), (4,5), (5,4). For a product of 6, there are 20 possibilities (1,6), (6,1), (2,6), (6,2), (3,6), (6,3), (4,6), (6,4), (5,6), (6,5). For a product of 7, there are 16 possibilities (1,7), (7,1), (2,7), (7,2), (3,7), (7,3), (4,7), (7,4), (5,7), (7,5), (6,7), (7,6). For a product of 8, there are 20 possibilities (1,8), (8,1), (2,8), (8,2), (3,8), (8,3), (4,8), (8,4), (5,8), (8,5), (6,8), (8,6), (7,8), (8,7). For a product of 9, there are 16 possibilities (1,9), (9,1), (2,9), (9,2), (3,9), (9,3), (4,9), (9,4), (5,9), (9,5), (6,9), (9,6), (7,9), (9,7), (8,9), (9,8). For a product of 10, there are 10 possibilities (1,10), (10,1), (2,10), (10,2), (3,10), (10,3), (4,10), (10,4), (5,10), (10,5), (6,10), (10,6), (7,10), (10,7), (8,10), (10,8), (9,10), (10,9).\n## Step 5:  However, we can simplify the calculation by observing the relationship between the numbers. We can notice that for a product greater than 10, we need at least one number to be 10 or greater, or both numbers to be 5 or greater.\n## Step 6:  Let's consider the pairs with both numbers 5 or greater. These pairs are (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (5,10), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (6,10), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (7,10), (8,8), (8,9), (8,10), (9,9), (9,10), (10,10), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (10,5), (6,5), (8,6), (9,6), (10,6), (7,6), (9,7), (10,7), (8,7), (10,8), (9,8), (10,9). There are 62 such pairs.\n## Step 7:  Next, we consider the pairs with at least one number 10 or greater. These pairs include (6,10), (7,10), (8,10), (9,10), (10,10), (10,8), (10,9), (10,7), (10,6), (10,5), (10,4), (10,3), (10,2), (10,1), (9,10), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (8,10), (8,9), (8,7), (8,6), (7,10), (7,9), (7,8), (7,6), (6,10), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7). There are 30 such pairs.\n## Step 8:  We can see that there are 62 + 30 = 92 pairs that do not have a product greater than 10.\n## Step 9:  Now, we can calculate the probability that the product of their numbers is more than 10 by subtracting the probability that the product is not greater than 10 from 1.\n## Step 10:  The probability that the product is not greater than 10 is given by the number of pairs with a product not greater than 10 divided by the total number of pairs.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the probability that the product of their numbers is more than 10 is $1 - \\frac{92}{100} = \\frac{8}{100} = \\frac{2}{25}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{25}}$"
