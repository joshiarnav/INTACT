    "problem": "A class of 25 students includes the Smith quadruplets.  The teacher must select two students from the class to represent the class in the school's student government.  Instead of holding an election, the teacher decides to choose the two representatives at random.  What is the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets?",
    "solution": "There are ${25 \\choose 2} = 300$ possible pairs of student representatives. Of these, since there are 4 Smith quadruplets, there are ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ pairs in which both representatives are Smith quadruplets. So, the probability of both representatives being Smith quadruplets is $\\frac{6}{300} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To begin solving this problem, we first need to understand the context and what the question is asking. The teacher must select two students at random from a class of 25 students to represent the class in the student government. Among these 25 students are the Smith quadruplets.\n## Step 2:  Since the specific names of the quadruplets (two boys and two girls) are not mentioned, we can assume that all four of them are distinct individuals for the purpose of this problem.\n## Step 3:  The problem asks for the probability that both representatives selected by the teacher will be Smith quadruplets. In other words, we want to find the likelihood that two randomly chosen students are among the four quadruplets.\n## Step 4:  To calculate this probability, we first need to determine the total number of ways to choose two students out of the 25 in the class. This is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{r}$, which represents the number of ways to choose r elements from a set of n elements without considering the order. In this case, the number of ways to choose 2 students out of 25 is $\\binom{25}{2}$.\n## Step 5:  Next, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 representatives from the 4 Smith quadruplets. This is also a combination, and it is given by $\\binom{4}{2}$.\n## Step 6:  Once we have these two values, we can calculate the probability by taking the ratio of the number of successful outcomes (choosing 2 quadruplets) to the total number of outcomes (choosing any 2 students).\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets is $\\dfrac{\\binom{4}{2}}{\\binom{25}{2}}$.\n## Step 8:  We can simplify this expression by calculating the values of the combinations.\n## Step 9:  Substituting the values, we get $\\dfrac{\\binom{4}{2}}{\\binom{25}{2}} = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{4!}{2!(4-2)!}}{\\dfrac{25!}{2!(25-2)!}} = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{4 \\times 3}{2}}{\\dfrac{25 \\times 24}{2}} = \\dfrac{6}{300} = \\dfrac{1}{50}$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets is $\\dfrac{1}{50}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{50}}$"
