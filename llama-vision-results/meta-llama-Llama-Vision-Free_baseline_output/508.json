    "problem": "In how many ways can 6 girls and 2 boys sit in a row if the 2 boys insist on sitting next to each other?",
    "solution": "We can consider the two boys as one person, arrange the ``seven'' people first, then arrange the 2 boys.  So the number of seating arrangements in which the boys sit together is $7!\\times 2!=\\boxed{10,\\!080}$.",
    "total_tokens": 362,

    "file_name": "./MATH/test/counting_and_probability/508.json",
    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Consider the 2 boys as a single unit\nTo ensure the 2 boys sit next to each other, we can treat them as a single unit. This effectively reduces our problem to arranging 5 units (6 girls + 1 unit of boys) in a row.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the 5 units\nThe number of ways to arrange 5 units in a row is given by the factorial of 5, denoted as 5!. This is because there are 5 choices for the first position, 4 for the second, 3 for the third, 2 for the fourth, and 1 for the fifth.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways the 2 boys can be arranged within their unit\nSince the 2 boys can sit in 2 different orders within their unit (either boy can be on the left or the right), we need to multiply the number of arrangements of the units by 2.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of arrangements\nThe total number of arrangements is the product of the number of arrangements of the 5 units and the number of arrangements of the 2 boys within their unit.\n\n## Step 5: Compute the values\n5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n2! = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2.\nThe total number of arrangements = 120 \u00d7 2 = 240.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{240}$"
