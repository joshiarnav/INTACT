    "problem": "Steve has one quarter, two nickels and three pennies. Assuming no items are free, for how many different-priced items could Steve individually pay for with exact change?",
    "solution": "Steve can use no quarters or one quarter, for two possibilities.\n\nSteve can use 0, 1, or 2 nickels, for three possibilities.\n\nAnd Steve can use 0, 1, 2, or 3 pennies, for four possibilities.  That gives $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 = 24$ possible combinations.  But we must remove the combination where Steve does not use any coins, leaving us with $24 - 1 = \\boxed{23}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Steve has\nSteve has one quarter, which is worth 25 cents, two nickels, which is worth 10 cents, and three pennies, which is worth 3 cents. So, the total amount of money Steve has is 25 + 10 + 3 = 38 cents.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the different denominations of coins Steve has\nSteve has quarters (25 cents), nickels (10 cents), and pennies (1 cent). These are the different denominations of coins he has.\n\n## Step 3: List all the possible combinations of coins that add up to 38 cents\n- 1 quarter = 25 cents\n- 1 quarter + 1 nickel = 35 cents\n- 1 quarter + 2 nickels = 35 cents\n- 1 quarter + 3 nickels = 40 cents (not possible, exceeds 38 cents)\n- 3 pennies = 3 cents\n- 1 nickel + 3 pennies = 13 cents\n- 2 nickels = 20 cents\n- 2 nickels + 3 pennies = 23 cents\n- 1 quarter + 2 pennies = 27 cents\n- 1 quarter + 1 nickel + 2 pennies = 32 cents\n- 2 nickels + 2 pennies = 22 cents\n- 1 quarter + 3 pennies = 28 cents\n\n## Step 4: Count the number of different-priced items Steve could buy\nWe have 11 different combinations of coins that add up to 38 cents.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$"
