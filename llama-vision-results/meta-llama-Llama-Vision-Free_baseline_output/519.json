    "problem": "In how many ways can 4 distinct beads be placed on a bracelet that has a knot in it?  (Beads cannot slide past the knot.  Two ways are considered the same if one is a reflection of the other, since we can flip the bracelet over.)",
    "solution": "We can just treat the knot as another bead. There are $5!$ ways to place the beads and the knot on the bracelet, but we must divide by 5 for rotational symmetry (5 rotations for each arrangement), and by 2 for reflectional symmetry (we can flip the bracelet to get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{5!}{5 \\times 2} = \\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, let's understand the nature of the problem. We are dealing with arranging 4 distinct beads on a bracelet that has a knot in it. This means that once we place the first bead, the remaining beads will be constrained by the presence of the knot.\n## Step 2:  Since the beads cannot slide past the knot, once we arrange the beads, the bracelet will be in a fixed position. We are also told that two ways are considered the same if one is a reflection of the other. This means we need to account for reflections in our counting.\n## Step 3:  We start by considering the number of ways we can arrange the 4 distinct beads in a linear fashion. There are $4!$ ways to arrange 4 distinct objects in a line, so in this case, we have 4! ways to arrange the beads.\n## Step 4:  However, we need to account for the fact that the bracelet can be flipped over, which means the arrangement of the beads can be the same if it's just a reflection. This effectively halves the number of arrangements, as a reflection essentially gives us the same arrangement.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the beads on the bracelet, taking reflections into account, is $\\frac{4!}{2} = \\frac{24}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
