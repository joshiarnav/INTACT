    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To simplify the given expression, we need to first understand what 18! (18 factorial) and 16! (16 factorial) represent.\n## Step 2:  The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to that number. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n## Step 3:  Therefore, 18! = 18 * 17 * 16 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 and 16! = 16 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.\n## Step 4:  We can simplify the expression by canceling out the common terms in the numerator and denominator, which are all the terms from 16!.\n## Step 5:  So, $\\frac{18!}{16!}$ simplifies to $\\frac{18 * 17 * 16!}{16!}$.\n## Step 6:  The 16! in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving us with 18 * 17.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, $\\frac{18!}{16!}$ simplifies to 18 * 17 = 306.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{306}$"
