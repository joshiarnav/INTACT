    "problem": "Our club has $25$ members, and wishes to pick a president, secretary, and treasurer. In how many ways can we choose the officers, if individual members are allowed to hold $2,$ but not all $3,$ offices?",
    "solution": "With no restriction, the president can be any of the $25$ members, the secretary can be any of the $25$ remaining members, and the treasurer can be any of the remaining $25$ members.\n\nIf the same member holds all three offices, it could be any of the $25$ members, so there are $25$ ways for this to happen. We must exclude these $25$ possibilities, so the answer is $25\\times 25\\times 25-25=\\boxed{15,600}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to pick the president\nThere are 25 ways to pick the president from the 25 members.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of ways to pick the secretary\nOnce the president is picked, there are 24 remaining members from which to pick the secretary.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to pick the treasurer\nAfter the president and secretary are picked, there are 23 remaining members from which to pick the treasurer.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to pick officers with two offices\nThere are 25 ways to pick the president, and then 24 ways to pick the secretary. For the second office, there are two possibilities: either the president or the secretary can become the treasurer. Therefore, there are 25 * 24 * 2 ways to pick officers with two offices.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to pick officers with three offices\nThere are 25 ways to pick the president, 24 ways to pick the secretary, and 23 ways to pick the treasurer. Therefore, there are 25 * 24 * 23 ways to pick officers with three offices.\n\n## Step 6: Subtract the number of ways that all officers were picked in the calculation for two offices from the calculation for two offices to get the final answer\nWe subtract the number of ways that all officers were picked in the calculation for two offices from the calculation for two offices. Since we counted the case in which all three offices were held by different people three times (once for each officer), we must subtract the number of ways of picking officers with three offices, which is 25 * 24 * 23.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the final answer\n25 * 24 * 2 - 25 * 24 * 23 = 1200 - 13800 = -12600.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4200}$"
