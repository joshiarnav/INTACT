    "problem": "If two numbers are randomly chosen without replacement from $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, what is the probability their sum is greater than their product? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers.  Observe that $ab-(a+b)=(a-1)(b-1)-1$.  This quantity is non-negative unless either $a$ or $b$ equals 1.  Therefore, the only pairs of positive integers for which the sum exceeds the product are those of the form $\\{1,n\\}$ where $n$ is a positive integer.  In this case, there are 4 such pairs: $\\{1,2\\}$, $\\{1,3\\}$, $\\{1,4\\}$, and $\\{1,5\\}$.  There are a total of $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ pairs of integers, so the probability that the sum exceeds the product is $\\frac{4}{10}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the sample space\nThe sample space consists of all possible pairs of numbers that can be chosen without replacement from $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n\n## Step 2: Enumerate the pairs in the sample space\nThere are 10 pairs in the sample space: $\\{(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)\\}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the pairs whose sum is greater than their product\nTo calculate the probability, we need to find the number of pairs where the sum is greater than the product. We will examine each pair in the sample space:\n- For $(1,2)$, $1+2=3$ and $1\\cdot2=2$, so the sum is greater than the product.\n- For $(1,3)$, $1+3=4$ and $1\\cdot3=3$, so the sum is not greater than the product.\n- For $(1,4)$, $1+4=5$ and $1\\cdot4=4$, so the sum is not greater than the product.\n- For $(1,5)$, $1+5=6$ and $1\\cdot5=5$, so the sum is not greater than the product.\n- For $(2,3)$, $2+3=5$ and $2\\cdot3=6$, so the sum is not greater than the product.\n- For $(2,4)$, $2+4=6$ and $2\\cdot4=8$, so the sum is not greater than the product.\n- For $(2,5)$, $2+5=7$ and $2\\cdot5=10$, so the sum is not greater than the product.\n- For $(3,4)$, $3+4=7$ and $3\\cdot4=12$, so the sum is not greater than the product.\n- For $(3,5)$, $3+5=8$ and $3\\cdot5=15$, so the sum is not greater than the product.\n- For $(4,5)$, $4+5=9$ and $4\\cdot5=20$, so the sum is not greater than the product.\nWe can see that only $(1,2)$ has a sum greater than its product.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability\nThere are 10 total possible pairs and only 1 pair where the sum is greater than the product, so the probability is $\\frac{1}{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$"
