    "problem": "At a mall's food court, Crystal has $\\$7.50$ to buy a meal (one entree, one drink and one dessert). The table below lists Crystal's choices and their prices including sales tax. How many distinct possible meals can she afford to buy? \\[\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline\n\\text{Entrees} & \\text{Drinks} & \\text{Desserts} \\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Pizza } \\$3.50 & \\text{Lemonade } \\$1.50 & \\text{Frozen Yogurt } \\$3.00 \\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Corn Dog } \\$2.50 & \\text{Soda } \\$1.25 & \\text{Cookies } \\$2.00 \\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Fish~\\& Chips } \\$3.50 & & \\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Fried Rice } \\$4.75 & & \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{array}\\]",
    "solution": "First, notice that Crystal cannot purchase an entire meal that includes Fried Rice.  The cheapest possibility would be Fried Rice, Soda, and Cookies, which still costs 50 cents too much.  Then, looking at the Pizza option, it is not possible for Crystal to purchase Frozen Yogurt with Pizza, as that would leave only one dollar for a drink.  Thus, she can purchase 2 different meals with Pizza (Pizza, Cookies, and either drink).  Since Fish and Chips cost the same as Pizza, there are likewise 2 different possible meals with Fish and Chips.  With a Corn Dog as her entree, Crystal can buy the most expensive meal (Corn Dog, Lemonade, and Frozen Yogurt), thus, she has 4 possible meals (Corn Dog, either drink, either dessert), making for $\\boxed{8\\text{ meals}}$ total.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: List all the possible combinations of entrees, drinks, and desserts.\nTo find the number of distinct possible meals Crystal can afford, we need to list out all the possible combinations of entrees, drinks, and desserts. Let's start by listing the options for each category: Entrees - Pizza, Corn Dog, Fish & Chips, Fried Rice; Drinks - Lemonade, Soda; Desserts - Frozen Yogurt, Cookies. We can now list all the possible combinations.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the total cost of each combination and check if Crystal can afford it.\nWe will now calculate the total cost of each combination and check if Crystal can afford it. We are given that Crystal has $7.50 to spend.\n\n## Step 3: List the combinations that Crystal can afford.\nWe will now list the combinations that Crystal can afford, given that she has $7.50 to spend.\n\n## Step 4: Count the total number of combinations that Crystal can afford.\nWe will finally count the total number of combinations that Crystal can afford.\n\n## Step 5: \nThe total cost of Pizza, Lemonade, and Frozen Yogurt is $3.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00, which is greater than $7.50.\nThe total cost of Pizza, Lemonade, and Cookies is $3.50 + $1.50 + $2.00 = $7.00, which is less than $7.50.\nThe total cost of Pizza, Soda, and Frozen Yogurt is $3.50 + $1.25 + $3.00 = $7.75, which is greater than $7.50.\nThe total cost of Pizza, Soda, and Cookies is $3.50 + $1.25 + $2.00 = $6.75, which is less than $7.50.\nThe total cost of Corn Dog, Lemonade, and Frozen Yogurt is $2.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $7.00, which is less than $7.50.\nThe total cost of Corn Dog, Lemonade, and Cookies is $2.50 + $1.50 + $2.00 = $6.00, which is less than $7.50.\nThe total cost of Corn Dog, Soda, and Frozen Yogurt is $2.50 + $1.25 + $3.00 = $6.75, which is less than $7.50.\nThe total cost of Corn Dog, Soda, and Cookies is $2.50 + $1.25 + $2.00 = $5.75, which is less than $7.50.\nThe total cost of Fish & Chips, Lemonade, and Frozen Yogurt is $3.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00, which is greater than $7.50.\nThe total cost of Fish & Chips, Lemonade, and Cookies is $3.50 + $1.50 + $2.00 = $7.00, which is less than $7.50.\nThe total cost of Fish & Chips, Soda, and Frozen Yogurt is $3.50 + $1.25 + $3.00 = $7.75, which is greater than $7.50.\nThe total cost of Fish & Chips, Soda, and Cookies is $3.50 + $1.25 + $2.00 = $6.75, which is less than $7.50.\nThe total cost of Fried Rice, Lemonade, and Frozen Yogurt is $4.75 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $9.25, which is greater than $7.50.\nThe total cost of Fried Rice, Lemonade, and Cookies is $4.75 + $1.50 + $2.00 = $8.25, which is greater than $7.50.\nThe total cost of Fried Rice, Soda, and Frozen Yogurt is $4.75 + $1.25 + $3.00 = $8.00, which is greater than $7.50.\nThe total cost of Fried Rice, Soda, and Cookies is $4.75 + $1.25 + $2.00 = $7.50, which is less than or equal to $7.50.\n\n## Step 6: The total number of combinations that Crystal can afford is 6.\nCrystal can afford the following combinations: Pizza, Soda, and Cookies; Corn Dog, Lemonade, and Frozen Yogurt; Corn Dog, Lemonade, and Cookies; Corn Dog, Soda, and Frozen Yogurt; Corn Dog, Soda, and Cookies; Fried Rice, Soda, and Cookies.\n\n## Step 7: Count the total number of distinct possible meals that Crystal can afford.\nWe have found that Crystal can afford 6 distinct possible meals.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the final answer.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
