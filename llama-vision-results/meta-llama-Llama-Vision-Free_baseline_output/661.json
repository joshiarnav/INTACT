    "solution": "Note that $5!$ divides $10!$ and $5!$ divides $15!$.  Since $5!$ has no factor larger than $5!$, and $5!$ is a factor of all three, the answer is $5!=\\boxed{120}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the concept of factorial\nFirst, let's understand what a factorial is. The factorial of a number, denoted by the symbol \"!,\" is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, 5! (5 factorial) is equal to 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate 5!\nWe need to calculate 5! which is equal to 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate 10!\nNext, let's calculate 10! which is equal to 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 3628800.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate 15!\nThen, let's calculate 15! which is equal to 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 1307674368000.\n\n## Step 5: Find the greatest common factor of 5!, 10!, and 15!\nTo find the greatest common factor of 5!, 10!, and 15!, we need to find the common factors between the three numbers. Since 5! is the smallest number, it will be the greatest common factor of the three numbers.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the greatest common factor\nThe greatest common factor of 5!, 10!, and 15! is 5! which is equal to 120.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{120}$"
