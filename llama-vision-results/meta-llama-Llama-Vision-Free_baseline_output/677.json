    "problem": "On the student government ballot at Dusable High School, the six candidates for president are listed first, followed by the four candidates for vice president, followed by the five candidates for secretary and ending with the three candidates for treasurer. In how many ways can the candidates be listed on the ballot?",
    "solution": "Since there are six candidates for president, the presidential candidates can be ordered in $6! = 720$ ways. Likewise, there are $4! = 24$ vice presidential permutations. And $5! = 120$ secretarial permutations. Finally, $3! = 6$ treasurer permutations. We must multiply the number of permutations for each position, since each ballot includes all the position permutations: $720 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 120 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{12441600}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the positions and the number of candidates for each position.\nThere are 6 candidates for president, 4 candidates for vice president, 5 candidates for secretary, and 3 candidates for treasurer.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the candidates for each position.\nThe number of ways to arrange the 6 candidates for president is 6! (6 factorial), the number of ways to arrange the 4 candidates for vice president is 4! (4 factorial), the number of ways to arrange the 5 candidates for secretary is 5! (5 factorial), and the number of ways to arrange the 3 candidates for treasurer is 3! (3 factorial).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of ways to arrange all the candidates.\nTo find the total number of ways to arrange all the candidates, multiply the number of ways to arrange each position together: 6! * 4! * 5! * 3!.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the factorial of each number.\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720,\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24,\n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120,\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n\n## Step 5: Multiply the factorials together to get the total number of ways.\n720 * 24 * 120 * 6 = 12441600.\n\nThe final answer is: 12441600"
