    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Identify the constraints for the first and final digits.\nThe first digit of a 3-digit number cannot be 0, but the final digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. Since the first digit is triple the final digit, we need to consider all possible triples of digits from 0 to 9.\n\n## Step 2:  Determine the possible final digits.\nGiven that the final digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, the first digit (which is triple the final digit) can be 0, 3, 6, or 9. These are the only possibilities because if the final digit were 10 or greater, the first digit would be 30 or greater, which would not be a single digit and thus not be a valid first digit for a 3-digit number.\n\n## Step 3:  For each possible final digit, determine the number of 3-digit numbers it can form.\n- For a final digit of 0, there is 1 possibility (10).\n- For a final digit of 1, there is 1 possibility (31).\n- For a final digit of 2, there is 1 possibility (62).\n- For a final digit of 3, there is 1 possibility (93).\n\n## Step 4:  Sum the possibilities for each final digit to get the total number of 3-digit numbers.\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n\n## Step 5:  But remember, we determined that the first digit could be 0 when the final digit is 0. This is incorrect because the first digit cannot be 0 for a 3-digit number. So, we should not count any number ending with 0.\n1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\n## Step 6:  There is another possible final digit that was missed in step 2: the final digit 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. But the first digit would be 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, which are not single digits.\nHowever, the final digit 4 has a first digit of 12, which is not a single digit, so it cannot be a valid number. But the first digit can be 3 for the final digit 4, 6 for the final digit 8.\nSo, we should count the numbers that end with 4, 6, 8.\nFor a final digit of 4, there is 1 possibility (34).\nFor a final digit of 6, there is 1 possibility (36).\nFor a final digit of 8, there is 1 possibility (48).\n\n## Step 7:  Sum the possibilities for the new final digits to get the total number of 3-digit numbers.\n1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\n## Step 8:  Add the total number of 3-digit numbers for the final digits 1, 2, 3, and the new total for the final digits 4, 6, 8.\n3 + 3 = 6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
