    "problem": "The letters of the word `SIXTEEN' are randomly arranged.  What is the probability that the two E's are not next to each other?",
    "solution": "The best way to do this is to find the probability that the two E's are next to each other.  There are $\\dfrac{7!}{2}$ arrangements of the word SIXTEEN.  If we want to find the number of arrangements such that the E's are next to each other, we find the number of arrangements of the six-letter word SIXT(EE)N (where we treat the two E's as a block), which is $6!$.  So the probability that an arrangement of the word SIXTEEN has the two E's next to each other is $\\dfrac{6!}{\\frac{7!}{2}} = \\dfrac{2}{7}$.  So the probability that the two E's aren't next to each other is $1 - \\dfrac{2}{7} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{7}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of arrangements of the letters in the word 'SIXTEEN'.\nThe word 'SIXTEEN' has 7 letters, with two of them being the letter 'E'. To calculate the total number of arrangements, we first calculate the total arrangements of the letters as if all were unique, which is 7!. Then, because there are two 'E's, we divide by the factorial of the number of times the letter 'E' repeats, which is 2!. So, the total number of arrangements is 7! / 2!.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of arrangements in which the two E's are next to each other.\nTo simplify the calculation, we can treat the two 'E's as a single unit, so we now have 6 units in total: the two 'E's (treated as one unit), 'S', 'X', 'T', 'N', and the other 'E' (also treated as one unit). These 6 units can be arranged in 6! ways. However, the two 'E's within their unit can also be arranged among themselves in 2! ways. So, the total number of arrangements with the two 'E's next to each other is 6! * 2!.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of arrangements in which the two E's are not next to each other.\nTo find the number of arrangements where the two 'E's are not next to each other, we subtract the number of arrangements where they are next to each other from the total number of arrangements. This is the total number of arrangements (from step 1) minus the number of arrangements with the 'E's next to each other (from step 2).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that the two E's are not next to each other.\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes (from step 3) divided by the total number of outcomes (from step 1).\n\n## Step 5: Perform the calculations for the total number of arrangements.\n7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040, and 2! = 2 * 1 = 2. So, the total number of arrangements is 5040 / 2 = 2520.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the calculations for the number of arrangements with the two E's next to each other.\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720, and 2! = 2. So, the total number of arrangements with the two 'E's next to each other is 720 * 2 = 1440.\n\n## Step 7: Perform the calculations for the number of arrangements where the two E's are not next to each other.\nThis is the total number of arrangements minus the number of arrangements with the 'E's next to each other: 2520 - 1440 = 1080.\n\n## Step 8: Perform the calculations for the probability.\nThe probability is the number of arrangements where the 'E's are not next to each other (from step 7) divided by the total number of arrangements (from step 5): 1080 / 2520.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the fraction representing the probability.\nTo simplify the fraction 1080 / 2520, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1080 and 2520. The GCD of 1080 and 2520 is 1080. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 1080, we get 1 / 2.33, which is approximately 0.433, but we can also express it as a fraction: 1/2.33 = 216/504 = 27/63 = 9/21 = 3/7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$"
