    "problem": "Mike draws five cards from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that he draws a card from at least three of the four suits? Express your answer as a simplified fraction.",
    "solution": "We calculate the probability that he does not draw a card from at least three of the suits. To do this, we calculate the number of sets of 5 cards from at most two suits and divide by $\\binom{52}5$, the number of sets of 5 cards. Since there are $\\binom42=6$ choices for the two suits, and $\\binom{26}5$ ways to choose 5 cards from the 26 in those two suits, our answer would appear to be $6\\binom{26}5$. But this triple-counts the ways to choose the cards from a single suit: 5 hearts is included in 5 (hearts and spades), 5 (hearts and clubs), and 5 (hearts and diamonds). So we subtract twice the number of ways to choose cards from a single suit: $6\\binom{26}5-2\\cdot4\\binom{13}5$. We divide this by $\\binom{52}5$ to get $$\\frac{6\\cdot26\\cdot25\\cdot24\\cdot23\\cdot22-8\\cdot13\\cdot12\\cdot11\\cdot10\\cdot9}{52\\cdot51\\cdot50\\cdot49\\cdot48}=\\frac{88}{595}.$$Therefore, the probability that he draws three or four of the suits is $1-\\frac{88}{595}=\\boxed{\\frac{507}{595}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the probability that Mike draws a card from at least three of the four suits when he draws five cards from a standard 52-card deck, we need to consider the total number of ways he can draw five cards and the number of successful outcomes.\n## Step 2:  First, let's calculate the total number of ways Mike can draw five cards from the deck. This can be represented by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $r$ is the number of items to choose. In this case, we have $\\binom{52}{5} = \\frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!} = 2,598,960$ ways to draw five cards.\n## Step 3:  Now, we need to determine the number of successful outcomes, which is the number of ways Mike can draw a card from at least three of the four suits.\n## Step 4:  We can approach this by finding the number of ways he can draw four cards from the same suit and one card from a different suit, and then subtracting the number of ways he can draw three cards from the same suit and two cards from different suits.\n## Step 5:  For the first scenario, there are 4 ways to choose the suit and $\\binom{13}{4} = 715$ ways to choose the four cards. Then, there are 48 cards left in the deck, and we need to choose one card from any of the three remaining suits, which gives us $\\binom{48}{1} \\cdot 3 = 144$ ways to choose the remaining card.\n## Step 6:  This gives us a total of $4 \\cdot 715 \\cdot 144 = 4,134,720$ ways to draw four cards from the same suit and one card from a different suit.\n## Step 7:  Now, let's consider the second scenario. There are $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways to choose the suit, and we need to choose three cards from that suit, which can be done in $\\binom{13}{3} = 286$ ways. Then, we need to choose two cards from each of the other three suits, which can be done in $\\binom{13}{2}^3 = 28,561$ ways.\n## Step 8:  This gives us a total of $4 \\cdot 286 \\cdot 28,561 = 32,502,624$ ways to draw three cards from the same suit and two cards from different suits.\n## Step 9:  Finally, we need to subtract the number of ways he can draw three cards from the same suit and two cards from different suits from the number of ways he can draw four cards from the same suit and one card from a different suit.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the probability of drawing a card from at least three of the four suits when drawing five cards from a standard 52-card deck is $\\frac{4,134,720-32,502,624}{2,598,960} = \\frac{2,311,936}{2,598,960} = \\frac{144}{1627} = \\boxed{\\frac{144}{1627}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{144}{1627}}$"
