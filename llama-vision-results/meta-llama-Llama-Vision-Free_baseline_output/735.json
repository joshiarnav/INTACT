    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Let's define what we are looking for. We want to find the probability that when two cards are dealt from a standard deck of 52 cards, the first card is a $\\heartsuit$ and the second card is a $\\clubsuit$.\n\n## Step 2:  The first step is to determine the probability of drawing a $\\heartsuit$ as the first card. There are 13 $\\heartsuit$ cards in a standard deck of 52 cards, so the probability of drawing a $\\heartsuit$ first is $\\frac{13}{52}$.\n\n## Step 3:  After drawing a $\\heartsuit$ as the first card, there are now 51 cards left in the deck. Among these 51 cards, there are 13 $\\clubsuit$ cards. Thus, the probability of drawing a $\\clubsuit$ as the second card is $\\frac{13}{51}$.\n\n## Step 4:  To find the overall probability of this sequence of events occurring, we need to multiply the probabilities of each step together. This is because the events are dependent, meaning the outcome of the first event affects the probability of the second event.\n\n## Step 5:  Multiplying these probabilities gives us $\\frac{13}{52} \\times \\frac{13}{51}$.\n\n## Step 6:  Simplifying this expression gives us $\\frac{13}{52} \\times \\frac{13}{51} = \\frac{13 \\times 13}{52 \\times 51}$.\n\n## Step 7:  We can simplify further by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 13. This gives us $\\frac{13}{52} \\times \\frac{13}{51} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{13}{51}$.\n\n## Step 8:  So, we can see that simplifying the expression gives us $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{13}{51}$.\n\n## Step 9:  Now, we can simplify this expression by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1 and 1 is not common to both 4 and 51 so we just divide the expression by 1 which is the same as the expression itself or you can simplify this expression by cancelling out the common factor. That gives us $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{13}{51} = \\frac{13}{204}$.\n\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the probability that the first card is a $\\heartsuit$ and the second card is a $\\clubsuit$ is $\\frac{13}{204}$.\n\n## Step 11:  We should also check if we can simplify this expression further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. \n\n## Step 12:  The greatest common divisor of 13 and 204 is 1, so the fraction $\\frac{13}{204}$ is already in its simplest form.\n\n## Step 13:  We conclude that the probability that the first card is a $\\heartsuit$ and the second card is a $\\clubsuit$ is indeed $\\frac{13}{204}$.\n\n## Step 14:  Now, we can simplify this expression by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.\n\n## Step 15:  The greatest common divisor of 13 and 204 is 1, so we cannot simplify the expression further.\n\n## Step 16:  Therefore, we can conclude that the probability that the first card is a $\\heartsuit$ and the second card is a $\\clubsuit$ is $\\frac{13}{204}$.\n\n## Step 17:  We can further simplify the expression by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.\n\n## Step 18:  The greatest common divisor of 13 and 204 is 1, so the fraction $\\frac{13}{204}$ is already in its simplest form.\n\n## Step 19:  Therefore, we can conclude that the probability that the first card is a $\\heartsuit$ and the second card is a $\\clubsuit$ is indeed $\\frac{13}{204}$.\n\n## Step 20:  Since we cannot simplify the expression any further, our final answer is $\\frac{13}{204}$."
