    "problem": "Two different numbers are randomly selected from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and they are multiplied. What is the probability that the product is even? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The product of two integers is even unless both of the integers are odd.  Therefore, the only pair of integers from the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ whose product is odd is $\\{1,3\\}$.  Since there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs, the probability of drawing $\\{1,3\\}$ is $\\frac{1}{6}$.  So the probability of drawing two numbers whose product is even is $1-\\dfrac{1}{6}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{6}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem requires us to find the probability of getting an even product when two different numbers are randomly selected from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and multiplied.\n## Step 2:  To find the probability, we need to consider all the possible pairs of numbers that can be formed and then count the pairs that result in an even product.\n## Step 3:  We know that a product is even if at least one of the factors is even. So, we'll identify all the pairs that contain at least one even number.\n## Step 4:  First, we list out all the possible pairs of different numbers from the set: $\\{1, 2\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{1, 4\\}, \\{2, 3\\}, \\{2, 4\\}, \\{3, 4\\}$.\n## Step 5:  Next, we identify the pairs that result in an even product - these are the pairs containing the numbers 2 and 4.\n## Step 6:  There are 6 total possible pairs, and 4 of them contain at least one even number, resulting in an even product.\n## Step 7:  So, the probability of selecting a pair whose product is even is the number of successful outcomes (4) divided by the total number of outcomes (6).\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the probability of getting an even product is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$"
