    "problem": "Nick, Janet, Huiju, and Amanda go to the World's Largest Brat Fest. Each of them is equally likely to order a meat brat, a hot dog, or a veggie brat. What is the probability that 2 of them order a meat brat, and the other two order hot dogs?",
    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability that a person will order a meat brat, a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability that they will order a hot dog, and a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability that they will order a veggie brat. We can choose which two people we want to order meat brats in $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways, and then we want the other two to order hot dogs. Once we've set who we want to order what, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) ^4=\\frac{1}{81}$ probability that they all actually order what we want them to. Therefore, the probability that two people order meat brats and the other two hot dogs is $6\\cdot \\frac{1}{81}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{27}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Identify the total number of outcomes for each person's order.\nEach person has 3 choices for their order: a meat brat, a hot dog, or a veggie brat.\n\n## Step 2:  Determine the total number of outcomes for the group of 4 people.\nSince each person has 3 choices, the total number of outcomes for the group is $3^4 = 81$.\n\n## Step 3:  Identify the number of ways to choose 2 people to order meat brats.\nWe can use combinations to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 4 to order meat brats. This is given by $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\n\n## Step 4:  Calculate the probability of the remaining 2 people ordering hot dogs.\nSince there are 2 remaining people, and they must order hot dogs, there is only 1 way for them to do so for each combination of people who order meat brats.\n\n## Step 5:  Calculate the total number of favorable outcomes.\nThe total number of favorable outcomes is the product of the number of ways to choose 2 people to order meat brats and the number of ways the remaining 2 people can order hot dogs. This is given by $6 \\times 1 = 6$.\n\n## Step 6:  Calculate the probability that 2 of them order a meat brat, and the other two order hot dogs.\nThe probability is given by the ratio of the total number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes for the group, which is $\\frac{6}{81}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction to obtain the final probability.\nSimplifying the fraction $\\frac{6}{81}$, we get $\\frac{2}{27}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{27}}$"
