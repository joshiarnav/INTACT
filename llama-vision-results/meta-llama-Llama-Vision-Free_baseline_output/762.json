    "problem": "Three points are chosen randomly and independently on a circle. What is the probability that all three pairwise distances between the points are less than the radius of the circle?",
    "solution": "We can assume that the circle has its center at $(0,0)$ and a radius of $1$. Call the three points $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $a$, $b$, and $c$ denote the length of the counterclockwise arc from $(1,0)$ to $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively. Rotating the circle if necessary, we can also assume that $a= \\pi/3$. Since $b$ and $c$ are chosen at random from $[0, 2\\pi)$, the ordered pair $(b,c)$ is chosen at random from a square with area $4\\pi^2$ in the $bc$-plane. The condition of the problem is met if and only if \\[\n0<b<\\frac{2\\pi}{3}, \\quad 0<c<\\frac{2\\pi}{3},\n\\quad\\text{and}\\quad |b-c|<\\frac{\\pi}{3}.\n\\]This last inequality is equivalent to $b-\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}<c<b+\\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\n[asy]\nfill((0,0)--(0.33,0)--(0.66,0.33)--(0.66,0.66)--(0.33,0.66)--(0,0.33)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2)--cycle,dashed);\ndraw((0,-0.33)--(1,0.66),dashed);\ndraw((-0.33,0)--(0.66,1),dashed);\ndraw((0.66,0)--(0.66,0.66)--(0,0.66),dashed);\ndraw((-0.5,0)--(2.5,0),Arrow);\ndraw((0,-0.5)--(0,2.5),Arrow);\nlabel(\"$c$\",(0,2.5),W);\nlabel(\"$b$\",(2.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"$\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$\",(0.66,0),S);\nlabel(\"$\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$\",(0,0.66),W);\nlabel(\"$2\\pi$\",(2,0),S);\nlabel(\"$2\\pi$\",(0,2),W);\n[/asy]\n\nThe graph of the common solution to these inequalities is the shaded region shown.

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions under which the three pairwise distances between three randomly chosen points on a circle are all less than the radius of the circle.\n## Step 2:  We should first consider the geometrical aspects of the problem. When three points are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we want to ensure that the distance between each pair of points is less than the radius of the circle.\n## Step 3:  One approach to tackling this problem is to use geometric reasoning and trigonometric principles to analyze the conditions for the pairwise distances to be less than the radius.\n## Step 4:  We know that for any two points on the circle, we can draw a chord between them. We aim to show that if the distance between any two points is less than the radius, then the third point must lie within a certain region on the circle.\n## Step 5:  We can choose one point, say $A$, and then select another point, say $B$, such that the chord $AB$ is less than the radius of the circle. We know that if point $A$ is fixed, then the possible locations of point $B$ are limited.\n## Step 6:  Using trigonometric principles, we can show that the third point, say $C$, must lie within a certain sector of the circle, bounded by the radii of the circle. This is because the sum of the angles of a triangle is always $180^\\circ$, and we want to ensure that each angle is less than $180^\\circ$.\n## Step 7:  By considering the sector in which the third point $C$ must lie, we can determine the probability that the three pairwise distances are less than the radius of the circle.\n## Step 8:  We will then use geometric reasoning to calculate the probability based on the ratio of the sector's area to the total area of the circle.\n\n## Step 9:  Given that point $A$ is fixed, we need to determine the range of possible locations for point $B$ such that the distance $AB$ is less than the radius of the circle.\n## Step 10:  When point $B$ is chosen, we can draw a chord $BC$ such that $AC < AB + BC < 2r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.\n## Step 11:  We can use trigonometric principles to determine the range of possible locations for point $C$ given that $AC < AB + BC < 2r$.\n## Step 12:  We can use the law of cosines to derive an inequality that limits the possible locations of point $C$ to a certain sector of the circle.\n## Step 13:  Using geometric reasoning, we can calculate the area of this sector, which will represent the favorable outcomes for the three pairwise distances to be less than the radius of the circle.\n## Step 14:  We can then use the ratio of this area to the total area of the circle to determine the probability.\n\n## Step 15:  The favorable outcomes are when point $C$ lies within a sector bounded by the radii of the circle, which is determined by the inequality derived using the law of cosines.\n## Step 16:  We can calculate the area of this sector using the formula for the area of a sector of a circle.\n## Step 17:  The area of the sector is given by $\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.\n## Step 18:  The total area of the circle is $\\pi r^2$.\n## Step 19:  Therefore, the probability that the three pairwise distances are less than the radius of the circle is the ratio of the area of the sector to the total area of the circle.\n\n## Step 20:  We can now calculate the probability using the area of the sector and the total area of the circle.\n## Step 21:  The probability is given by $\\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2}{\\pi r^2}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$"
