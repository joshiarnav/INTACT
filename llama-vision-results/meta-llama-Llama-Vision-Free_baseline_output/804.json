    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the number of sides in a polygon and the number of diagonals it has.\n## Step 2:  The formula to calculate the number of diagonals in an n-gon is given by $n(n-3)/2$.\n## Step 3:  This formula works because each vertex of the polygon can be connected to (n-3) other vertices via diagonals, and there are n vertices in total.\n## Step 4:  However, we need to divide by 2 to avoid counting each diagonal twice (once from each of its endpoints).\n## Step 5:  We are asked to find the number of diagonals in the fifth polygon of the given sequence, which means we need to find the number of diagonals in a 15-sided polygon.\n## Step 6:  We can apply the formula $n(n-3)/2$ to find the number of diagonals in a 15-sided polygon.\n## Step 7:  Substituting n = 15 into the formula, we get $15(15-3)/2 = 15 \\cdot 12 / 2 = 15 \\cdot 6 = 90$.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the fifth polygon in the sequence has 90 diagonals.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{90}$"
