    "problem": "Liz has 11 marbles of different colors. In how many ways can she choose 3 of the marbles, if she refuses to choose the green one and the purple one at the same time?",
    "solution": "We can divide this into cases:\n\nCase 1: Liz chooses the green marble, and not the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles (since she won't choose the purple marble). So, there are $\\binom{9}{2}=36$ choices in this case.\n\nCase 2: Liz chooses the purple marble, and not the green marble. As in Case 1, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles. So, there are $\\binom{9}{2}$ choices in this case.\n\nCase 3: Liz chooses neither the green marble nor the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose three marbles from the nine remaining marbles, and there are $\\binom{9}{3}=84$ choices in this case.\n\nThe total number of possible choices is $36+36+84=\\boxed{156}$.\n\nAlternatively, there are $\\binom{11}{3}=165$ ways to select three marbles. Of those, $\\binom{9}{1}=9$ ways contain both the purple marble and the green marble. Therefore, there are $165-9=\\boxed{156}$ ways to select three marbles such that purple and green marbles are not both chosen.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, we need to find the total number of ways Liz can choose 3 marbles out of 11, regardless of the two marbles she refuses to choose together.\nWe calculate this using the combination formula: $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $k$ is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial. For this scenario, we have 11 marbles and we want to choose 3, so the total number of ways is $C(11, 3) = \\frac{11!}{3!(11-3)!} = \\frac{11!}{3!8!} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 165$.\n\n## Step 2: Next, we need to determine the number of ways Liz can choose 3 marbles that include both the green one and the purple one. Since we're choosing 3 marbles and two of them are already picked, we only need to choose 1 more marble from the remaining 9 marbles.\nThe number of ways to choose 1 marble out of 9 is given by $C(9, 1) = \\frac{9!}{1!(9-1)!} = \\frac{9!}{1!8!} = 9$.\n\n## Step 3: Finally, we subtract the number of ways that include both the green and purple marbles from the total number of ways to get the final answer.\nSubtract the result from step 2 from the result in step 1: $165 - 9 = 156$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{156}$"
