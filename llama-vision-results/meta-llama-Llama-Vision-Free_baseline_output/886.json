    "problem": "A license plate consists of two letters followed by two digits; for example, $MP78$. Neither the digits nor the letters may be repeated, and neither the letter $O$ nor the digit $0$ may be used. When reading from left to right, the letters must be in alphabetical order and the digits must be in increasing order. How many different license plate combinations are possible?",
    "solution": "Given any set of two distinct letters (neither of which is O) and two distinct digits (neither of which is 0), we can build exactly one license plate because, whatever the letters and digits, there is only one allowed order.  We can choose two distinct letters (excluding O) in $\\binom{25}{2}$ ways and two distinct digits (excluding 0) in $\\binom{9}{2}$ ways.  Thus the total number of license plates is $\\binom{25}{2}\\binom{9}{2} = \\boxed{10800}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the number of license plate combinations that consist of two letters followed by two digits, where the letters must be in alphabetical order, the digits must be in increasing order, neither the digits nor the letters may be repeated, and neither the letter O nor the digit 0 may be used.\n\n## Step 2: Count the possibilities for the first letter\nFor the first letter, there are 25 possibilities ($A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, $F$, $G$, $H$, $I$, $J$, $K$, $L$, $M$, $N$, $P$, $Q$, $R$, $S$, $T$, $U$, $V$, $W$, $X$, $Y$, $Z$).\n\n## Step 3: Count the possibilities for the second letter\nFor the second letter, given that the letters must be in alphabetical order, there are 24 possibilities (since the second letter must be greater than the first letter).\n\n## Step 4: Count the possibilities for the first digit\nFor the first digit, there are 8 possibilities (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\n\n## Step 5: Count the possibilities for the second digit\nFor the second digit, given that the digits must be in increasing order, there are 8 possibilities for the first digit, and then 7 possibilities for the second digit, since the second digit must be greater than the first digit.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of combinations\nTo calculate the total number of license plate combinations, we multiply the number of possibilities for each part together: $25 \\times 24 \\times 8 \\times 7 = 25 \\times 24 \\times 56$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total number of combinations\n$25 \\times 24 = 600$, and $600 \\times 56 = 33600$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{33600}$"
