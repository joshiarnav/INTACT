    "solution": "The Binomial Theorem says that, to find the coefficient of $x^ay^b$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^{a+b}$, we choose $a$ of the $(a+b)$ terms to contribute $x$ to the product, then the other $b$ terms contribute a $y$. Similarly, to find the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in $(x+y+z)^8$, we choose 3 of the 8 $(x+y+z)$ terms in the product $(x+y+z)^8$ to contribute an $x$ (which we can do in $\\binom{8}{3}$ ways), 3 of the remaining 5 terms to contribute a $y$ (which we can do in $\\binom{5}{3}$ ways), and the remaining 2 terms contribute $z$'s to the product. Thus, our answer is  \\[\\binom{8}{3}\\binom{5}{3}=56\\cdot 10=\\boxed{560}\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks for the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$.\n## Step 2:  To approach this, we can use the Multinomial Theorem, which allows us to expand expressions of the form $(x_1+x_2+\\ldots+x_k)^n$.\n## Step 3:  According to the theorem, the coefficient of $x_1^{a_1}x_2^{a_2}\\ldots x_k^{a_k}$ in the expansion of $(x_1+x_2+\\ldots+x_k)^n$ is given by $\\frac{n!}{a_1!a_2!\\ldots a_k!}$.\n## Step 4:  Here, we have $(x+y+z)^8$, so we want to find the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$, where $a_1=3$, $a_2=3$, and $a_3=2$.\n## Step 5:  Applying the Multinomial Theorem, the required coefficient is then given by $\\frac{8!}{3!3!2!}$.\n## Step 6:  Calculating this, we get $\\frac{8\\cdot 7\\cdot 6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3!}{3!\\cdot 3!\\cdot 2\\cdot 1} = \\frac{8\\cdot 7\\cdot 2\\cdot 5\\cdot 4}{2} = 8\\cdot 7\\cdot 10 = 560$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$ is $\\boxed{560}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{560}$"
