    "problem": "Seven cards each containing one of the following letters C, B, T, A, E, M and H are placed in a hat. Each letter is used only once. Stu will pull four cards out at random and without replacement. What is the probability that Stu pulls out M, A, T, H in this order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that Stu pulls the M out first is 1/7. The probability that he then pulls the A out next is 1/6, since there are now 6 letter remaining.  Continuing in this way, the probability that he pulls out T next is 1/5 and the probability that H then follows is 1/4.  Therefore, the probability that he pulls out M, A, T, H in this order is $1/7 \\times 1/6 \\times 1/5 \\times 1/4 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{840}}$.",

The probability of pulling A as the second card is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of pulling T as the third card after M and A have been pulled\nAfter M and A have been pulled, there are 5 cards left. The probability of pulling T as the third card is $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of pulling H as the fourth card after M, A, and T have been pulled\nAfter M, A, and T have been pulled, there are 4 cards left. The probability of pulling H as the fourth card is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability that Stu pulls out M, A, T, H in this order\nThe probability that Stu pulls out M, A, T, H in this order is $\\frac{1}{7}\\cdot\\frac{1}{6}\\cdot\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{1}{840}$.\n\n## Step 7: Multiply the probability by the total number of ways to choose 4 cards out of 7\nHowever, this is not the correct calculation for the final probability, as we are asked to find the probability that the four cards are pulled in a specific order, and then there are still $\\binom{4}{4}=1$ ways to choose the remaining 4 cards. Therefore, the final probability is $\\frac{1}{7}\\cdot\\frac{1}{6}\\cdot\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot1=\\frac{1}{840}$, which is the same as the calculation in Step 6. But in this case, we need to multiply by 1, which does not change the value.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the fraction $\\frac{1}{840}$\nThe fraction $\\frac{1}{840}$ cannot be simplified further.\n\n## Step 9: Write the final probability\nTherefore, the final probability that Stu pulls out M, A, T, H in this order is $\\frac{1}{840}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{840}}$"
