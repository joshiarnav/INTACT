    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We need to determine the number of distinct arrangements possible for placing 2 indistinguishable IMO gold medals and 2 indistinguishable IPhO gold medals in a row.\n## Step 2:  The problem can be approached by first considering the different cases in which the medals can be arranged.\n## Step 3:  Case 1: Both IMO and IPhO medals are together. This means we have the arrangement \"IMO, IPhO\" or \"IPhO, IMO\". We can choose the positions of the IMO gold medals in 3 different ways, and then the positions of the IPhO gold medals are fixed.\n## Step 4:  Case 2: The IMO gold medals are together but the IPhO gold medals are not. This arrangement can be visualized as \"IMO, _, _\". There are 3 ways to choose the positions of the IMO gold medals, and 2 ways to choose the positions of the IPhO gold medals.\n## Step 5:  Case 3: The IPhO gold medals are together but the IMO gold medals are not. This is similar to Case 2, with the IMO and IPhO positions reversed. Therefore, there are also 6 arrangements in this case.\n## Step 6:  Case 4: The IMO gold medals are not together and the IPhO gold medals are not together. This arrangement can be represented as \"_ , _, _\". There are 3 ways to choose the positions of the IMO gold medals and 2 ways to choose the positions of the IPhO gold medals, resulting in 6 arrangements.\n## Step 7:  Now, we can calculate the total number of distinct arrangements by summing up the arrangements from each of these cases.\n## Step 8:  In Case 1, we have 3 arrangements with the IMO gold medals together, and then 2 arrangements with the IPhO gold medals together, resulting in a total of 3 * 2 = 6 arrangements.\n## Step 9:  For Case 2 and Case 3, we have 6 arrangements in each case.\n## Step 10:  In Case 4, we have 6 arrangements.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements is 6 + 6 + 6 = 18.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
