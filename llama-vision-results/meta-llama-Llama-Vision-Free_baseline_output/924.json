    "problem": "A nursery employee wishes to plant 2 identical Golden Delicious apple trees and 5 identical Bartlett pear trees in one row. How many distinct arrangements are possible?",
    "solution": "We have 7 places to plant trees in our row.  We can choose two of these to be Golden Delicious in $\\binom{7}{2}= \\boxed{21}$ ways.  For each of these choices, we plant the Bartlett pears in the remaining 5 places.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of trees to be planted\nThere are 2 Golden Delicious apple trees and 5 Bartlett pear trees, making a total of 2 + 5 = 7 trees.\n\n## Step 2: Understand that this is a combination problem since the trees of the same variety are identical\nSince the trees are identical within each variety, the order of the trees of the same variety does not matter, but the arrangement of the different varieties does.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of distinct arrangements using combinations\nTo find the number of distinct arrangements, we can use the formula for combinations. However, since we are arranging items where some of them are identical, we need to use the formula for permutations of a set with repeated elements. The formula for permutations of n objects where there are n1, n2, etc. identical objects of each type is n! / (n1! * n2! * ...).\n\n## Step 4: Apply the formula to the given problem\nIn this case, we have 7 total trees (n=7), 2 of which are identical Golden Delicious apple trees (n1=2), and 5 of which are identical Bartlett pear trees (n2=5). Plugging these values into the formula gives us 7! / (2! * 5!).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the factorial values\n7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040, 2! = 2 * 1 = 2, and 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n\n## Step 6: Plug the factorial values into the formula\n5040 / (2 * 120) = 5040 / 240.\n\n## Step 7: Perform the division\n5040 / 240 = 21.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$"
