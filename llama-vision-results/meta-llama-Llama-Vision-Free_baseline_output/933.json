    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the pattern for rows with only even entries\nTo find rows with at least one even entry and no odd entries other than 1, we first need to understand the pattern for rows with only even entries. It is given that the rows with only even entries (other than the first 1) are those of the form $2^n$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the pattern for rows with no odd entries other than 1\nNext, we need to understand that any row with all even entries, other than the first and last 1, must be of the form $2^n$, where n is a positive integer.\n\n## Step 3: Identify rows with at least one even entry and no odd entries other than 1\nFor a row to have at least one even entry and no odd entries other than 1, it must be of the form $2^n$, where n is a positive integer.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the rows of Pascal's triangle that are of the form $2^n$\nNow, let's find the rows that are of the form $2^n$, where n is a positive integer, within the first 100 rows.\n\n## Step 5: Count the number of rows with the form $2^n$\nWe need to find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 100, which will give us the number of rows that are of the form $2^n$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of rows of the form $2^n$ less than or equal to 100\nThe largest power of 2 less than or equal to 100 is $2^6$, so there are 6 rows of Pascal's triangle that are of the form $2^n$.\n\n## Step 7: Consider rows that are not of the form $2^n$\nWe also need to consider rows that are not of the form $2^n$ but still contain at least one even entry and no odd entries other than 1.\n\n## Step 8: Realize that no other rows have this property\nBy the given condition, it is stated that the rows with only even entries, other than the first 1, are those of the form $2^n$. Therefore, no other rows have this property.\n\n## Step 9: Count the total number of rows of the form $2^n$\nThere are a total of 7 rows that are of the form $2^n$ (including row 0).\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the number of rows with the desired property within the first 100 rows\nWe need to exclude row 0 since it only contains one entry, which is 1.\n\n## Step 11: Exclude row 0\nThere are 6 rows with the desired property.\n\n## Step 12: Determine the number of rows containing at least one even entry and no odd entries other than 1\nThis is the number of rows of the form $2^n$ within the first 100 rows.\n\n## Step 13: Provide the final count\nThere are 6 such rows.\n\n## Step 14: Determine the final answer\nThere are 6 rows that contain at least one even entry and no odd entries other than 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
