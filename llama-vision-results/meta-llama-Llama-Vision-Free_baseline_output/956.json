    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To solve this problem, we first need to understand what is being asked. We are looking for the probability that when two numbers between 0 and 1 are chosen at random on a number line, the second number chosen exceeds the first number chosen by a distance greater than $\\frac 14$ unit.\n\n## Step 2: Let's visualize the number line between 0 and 1. When choosing the first number, it can be any point within this range. We can imagine this range as a segment of length 1 on the number line.\n\n## Step 3: To satisfy the condition, the second chosen number must be greater than the first by a distance greater than $\\frac 14$ unit. This means if the first number is $x$, the second number must be greater than $x+\\frac 14$.\n\n## Step 4: We can visualize the area on the number line where this condition is satisfied by drawing a line that represents $x+\\frac 14$. This line will start from $\\frac 14$ (since the smallest number that exceeds any other number by $\\frac 14$ is $\\frac 14$ itself) and end at $1$.\n\n## Step 5: However, we should also consider the scenario where the first number chosen is 0, because if the first number is 0, the only way the second number can exceed it by more than $\\frac 14$ is if it is greater than $\\frac 14$.\n\n## Step 6: We notice that the area satisfying our conditions can be divided into two parts: the area where the first number is less than $\\frac 14$, and the area where the first number is greater than $\\frac 14$.\n\n## Step 7: In the first part, where the first number is less than $\\frac 14$, we have a trapezoid with bases of lengths $1$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$ (because the point where the line $x+\\frac 14$ intersects the number line is $\\frac 14$, and the point where the second line intersects is 1), and height $\\frac 14$.\n\n## Step 8: In the second part, where the first number is greater than $\\frac 14$, we have a rectangle with sides of lengths $\\frac 34$ and $\\frac 34$.\n\n## Step 9: To calculate the area of the trapezoid, we use the formula for the area of a trapezoid: $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$. Plugging in the values, we get $A = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac 34 + 1)(\\frac 14)$.\n\n## Step 10: To calculate the area of the rectangle, we simply multiply the length and width: $A = \\frac 34 \\times \\frac 34$.\n\n## Step 11: To calculate the total area where the condition is satisfied, we add the area of the trapezoid and the area of the rectangle.\n\n## Step 12: The total area of the number line where we are choosing our numbers is 1.\n\n## Step 13: The probability that the second number chosen exceeds the first number chosen by a distance greater than $\\frac 14$ unit is the ratio of the total area where the condition is satisfied to the total area of the number line.\n\n## Step 14: We can calculate the total area of the number line where the condition is satisfied as the sum of the areas of the trapezoid and the rectangle.\n\n## Step 15: The area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac 34 + 1)(\\frac 14)$, which simplifies to $\\frac{7}{32}$.\n\n## Step 16: The area of the rectangle is $\\frac 34 \\times \\frac 34$, which simplifies to $\\frac{9}{16}$.\n\n## Step 17: We then calculate the total area where the condition is satisfied by adding the area of the trapezoid and the area of the rectangle.\n\n## Step 18: The sum of the areas is $\\frac{7}{32} + \\frac{9}{16}$.\n\n## Step 19: To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 32. So we rewrite $\\frac{9}{16}$ as $\\frac{9 \\times 2}{16 \\times 2}$.\n\n## Step 20: This simplifies to $\\frac{18}{32}$.\n\n## Step 21: We then add the fractions $\\frac{7}{32}$ and $\\frac{18}{32}$.\n\n## Step 22: The sum is $\\frac{7 + 18}{32} = \\frac{25}{32}$.\n\n## Step 23: Therefore, the probability that the second number exceeds the first number by more than $\\frac 14$ unit is the ratio of this area to the total area of the number line, which is 1.\n\n## Step 24: The probability is thus $\\frac{25}{32} \\div 1$.\n\n## Step 25: Simplifying this, we get $\\frac{25}{32}$.\n\n## Step 26: Therefore, the probability that the second number chosen will exceed the first number chosen by a distance greater than $\\frac 14$ unit on the number line is $\\frac{25}{32}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{32}}$"
