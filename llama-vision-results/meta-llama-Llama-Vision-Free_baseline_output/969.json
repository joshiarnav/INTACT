    "problem": "Two real numbers are chosen at random between $0$ and $2.$ What is the probability that the sum of their squares is no more than $4?$ Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "We let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$.  The set of all possible pairs $(x,y)$ satisfy the inequalities $0<x<2$ and $0<y<2$; we can graph these points as a square on the $x-y$ plane with vertices $(0,0),(2,0),(2,2)$ and $(0,2)$.  This square has area $4.$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1.5 cm);\n\nfilldraw(arc((0,0),2,0,90)--(0,0)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2)--cycle);\n\nlabel(\"$0$\", (0,0), S);\nlabel(\"$2$\", (2,0), S);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (2,0), E);\nlabel(\"$0$\", (0,0), W);\nlabel(\"$2$\", (0,2), W);\nlabel(\"$y$\", (0,2), N);\n[/asy]\n\nWe want to find the area of the set of points which also satisfies $x^2+y^2\\le 4$.

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the sample space and the condition for the sum of squares.\nThe sample space consists of all possible pairs of real numbers between 0 and 2, which can be represented as points on a 2-dimensional plane. Each point corresponds to a pair (x, y) where 0 \u2264 x \u2264 2 and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 2. The condition for the sum of squares is that x^2 + y^2 \u2264 4.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize that the condition x^2 + y^2 \u2264 4 describes a circle.\nThe equation x^2 + y^2 = 4 represents a circle with a radius of 2, centered at the origin (0, 0).\n\n## Step 3: Understand the geometric interpretation of the problem.\nThe area of the sample space is a square with side length 2, so its area is 2 * 2 = 4. The condition x^2 + y^2 \u2264 4 describes the area inside this circle.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the circle described by x^2 + y^2 \u2264 4.\nThe area of a circle is given by the formula \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. In this case, the radius is 2, so the area of the circle is \u03c0(2)^2 = 4\u03c0.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability.\nThe probability is the ratio of the area of the circle (which satisfies the condition x^2 + y^2 \u2264 4) to the area of the square. Therefore, the probability is the area of the circle divided by the area of the square, which is 4\u03c0 / 4 = \u03c0.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$"
