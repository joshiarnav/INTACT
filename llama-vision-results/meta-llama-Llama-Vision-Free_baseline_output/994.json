    "problem": "How many of the natural numbers from $1$ to $800,$ inclusive, contain the digit $6$ at least twice? (The numbers $266$ and $663$ are two natural numbers that contain the digit $6$ at least twice, but $430$ or $16$ are not.)",
    "solution": "There are $10$ numbers with a $6$ in the hundreds place and a $6$ in the units place.\n\nThere are $10$ numbers with a $6$ in the hundreds place and a $6$ in the tens place.\n\nThere are $8$ numbers with a $6$ in the tens place and a $6$ in the units place. (Remember, we only have the numbers from $1$ to $800.$)\n\nAdding them up, we have $10+10+8 = 28.$ However, we counted $666$ three times. Therefore subtract $2$ from $28$ to get $\\boxed{26}$ numbers containing the digit $6$ at least twice.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total count of numbers from 1 to 800 that contain the digit 6 at least once.\nWe can use complementary counting to find the count of numbers that contain the digit 6 at least once. We will count the numbers that do not contain the digit 6 and subtract this from the total count of numbers.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the count of numbers that do not contain the digit 6 in the hundreds place.\nThere are 7 options for the hundreds place (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8) since the digit 6 is not allowed.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the count of numbers that do not contain the digit 6 in the tens place.\nThere are 9 options for the tens place (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) since the digit 6 is not allowed.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the count of numbers that do not contain the digit 6 in the ones place.\nThere are 9 options for the ones place (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) since the digit 6 is not allowed.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total count of numbers that do not contain the digit 6.\nUsing the counts from the previous steps, we can calculate the total count of numbers that do not contain the digit 6: 7 * 9 * 9 = 567.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total count of numbers from 1 to 800 that contain the digit 6 at least once.\nThe total count of numbers from 1 to 800 is 800. The count of numbers that contain the digit 6 at least once is 800 - 567 = 233.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the count of numbers that contain the digit 6 exactly once.\nWe can use complementary counting to find the count of numbers that contain the digit 6 exactly once. We will count the numbers that contain the digit 6 at least twice and subtract this from the count of numbers that contain the digit 6 at least once.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the count of numbers that contain the digit 6 in the hundreds place and exactly once in the tens and ones places.\nThere are 7 options for the hundreds place (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8) since the digit 6 is not allowed in the hundreds place. There are 8 options for the tens place (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) since the digit 6 is allowed in the tens place. There are 9 options for the ones place (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) since the digit 6 is not allowed in the ones place. However, we must subtract 1 from the count of options for the ones place because we are counting only numbers that contain the digit 6 exactly once.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the count of numbers that contain the digit 6 in the tens place and exactly once in the hundreds and ones places.\nThere are 8 options for the tens place (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) since the digit 6 is not allowed in the tens place. There are 7 options for the hundreds place (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8) since the digit 6 is not allowed in the hundreds place. There are 8 options for the ones place (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) since the digit 6 is allowed in the ones place. However, we must subtract 1 from the count of options for the ones place because we are counting only numbers that contain the digit 6 exactly once.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the count of numbers that contain the digit 6 in the ones place and exactly once in the hundreds and tens places.\nThere are 9 options for the ones place (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) since the digit 6 is not allowed in the ones place. There are 8 options for the tens place (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) since the digit 6 is not allowed in the tens place. There are 7 options for the hundreds place (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8) since the digit 6 is not allowed in the hundreds place.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the total count of numbers that contain the digit 6 exactly once.\nUsing the counts from the previous steps, we can calculate the total count of numbers that contain the digit 6 exactly once: (7 * 8 * 8) + (8 * 7 * 8) + (9 * 8 * 7) = 448.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the count of numbers that contain the digit 6 at least twice.\nThe count of numbers that contain the digit 6 at least twice can be found by subtracting the count of numbers that contain the digit 6 exactly once from the count of numbers that contain the digit 6 at least once: 233 - 448 = -215\n\nHowever, there is a problem in our previous steps. Now let's calculate the number of ways to choose two digits from three places (hundreds, tens, and ones) to be 6: There are 3 options to place the digit 6. For the hundreds place, there are 7 options. For the tens place, there are 8 options. For the ones place, there are 8 options.\n\n## Step 13: Calculate the count of numbers that contain the digit 6 in exactly two places.\nThe count of numbers that contain the digit 6 in exactly two places is: 3 * (7 * 8) = 168.\n\n## Step 14: Calculate the count of numbers that contain the digit 6 in all three places.\nThere are 7 options for the hundreds place (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8). There are 8 options for the tens place (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9). There are 8 options for the ones place (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9). However, we must subtract 1 from the count of options for the hundreds place because we are counting only numbers that contain the digit 6 exactly twice in the tens and ones places.\n\n## Step 15: Calculate the count of numbers that contain the digit 6 in exactly two places and hundreds place is not 6.\nThe count of numbers that contain the digit 6 in exactly two places and hundreds place is not 6 is: 7 * 8 * 8 = 448.\n\n## Step 16: Calculate the count of numbers that contain the digit 6 in all three places.\nThe count of numbers that contain the digit 6 in all three places is: 1 * 8 * 8 = 64.\n\n## Step 17: Calculate the count of numbers that contain the digit 6 at least twice.\nThe count of numbers that contain the digit 6 at least twice is: 168 + 64 = 232\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{232}$"
