    "problem": "Pat is to select six cookies from a tray containing only chocolate chip, oatmeal, and peanut butter cookies. There are at least six of each of these three kinds of cookies on the tray. How many different assortments of six cookies can be selected? (Note that cookies of the same type are not distinguishable.)",
    "solution": "The numbers of the three types of cookies must have a sum of six. Possible sets of whole numbers whose sum is six are \\[\n0,0,6;\\ 0,1,5;\\ 0,2,4;\\ 0,3,3;\\ 1,1,4;\\ 1,2,3;\\ \\ \\text{and}\\ 2,2,2.\n\\]Every ordering of each of these sets determines a different assortment of cookies. There are 3 orders for each of the sets \\[\n0,0,6;\\ 0,3,3;\\ \\text{and}\\ 1,1,4.\n\\]There are 6 orders for each of the sets \\[\n0,1,5;\\ 0,2,4;\\ \\text{and}\\ 1,2,3.\n\\]There is only one order for $2,2,2$. Therefore the total number of assortments of six cookies is $3\\cdot 3 + 3\\cdot 6 + 1 = \\boxed{28}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We're asked to find the number of different assortments of six cookies that Pat can select from a tray containing only chocolate chip, oatmeal, and peanut butter cookies.\n## Step 2:  Since the cookies of the same type are indistinguishable, we can represent the selection of cookies as a stars-and-bars problem, where the stars represent the cookies and the bars separate the different types of cookies.\n## Step 3:  In this case, we have 6 cookies to select, so we can represent this as 6 stars. We want to place 2 bars to separate the different types of cookies into 3 categories, which will give us the number of each type of cookie.\n## Step 4:  The selection of 2 bars from 8 positions (6 stars and 2 bars) can be represented as $\\binom{8}{2}$.\n## Step 5:  So, there are $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways to select the 2 bars, which corresponds to the different assortments of 6 cookies.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the total number of different assortments of six cookies that Pat can select is $\\boxed{28}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28}$"
