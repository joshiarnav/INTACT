    "problem": "A Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans.  In how many distinguishable ways can they sit around a circular table if all the members of each party all sit next to each other?  (If the table is rotated, it should be counted as the same seating.)",
    "solution": "Choose any 5 consecutive seats in which to place the Democrats -- it doesn't matter which 5 consecutive seats that we choose, since we can rotate the table.  Then there are $5!$ ways to place the Democrats in their seats, and $5!$ ways to place the Republicans in their seats, for a total of $5! \\times 5! = \\boxed{14,\\!400}$ arrangements.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the constraint of the problem\nThe problem states that all the members of each party must sit next to each other. This means that the 5 Democrats can be considered as a single block, and the 5 Republicans can be considered as another single block.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the blocks around a circular table\nSince the table is circular, we consider the arrangement of the blocks relative to each other. The 2 blocks (Democrats and Republicans) can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways around the circular table.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the individuals within each block\nWithin each block, the individuals can be arranged in different ways. The 5 Democrats can be arranged in 5! = 120 ways, and the 5 Republicans can also be arranged in 5! = 120 ways.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of distinguishable ways to seat the committee\nThe total number of ways to seat the committee is the product of the number of ways to arrange the blocks and the number of ways to arrange the individuals within each block. Therefore, the total number of ways is 2 * 120 * 120 = 28800.\n\n## Step 5: Account for the fact that rotating the table does not change the seating arrangement\nSince the table is circular, we need to divide the total number of ways by the number of possible rotations that result in the same seating arrangement. For a circular arrangement of 11 people, there are 11 possible rotations that result in the same seating. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of ways by 11.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final answer\nDividing the total number of ways (28800) by the number of possible rotations (11) gives us the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2624}$"
