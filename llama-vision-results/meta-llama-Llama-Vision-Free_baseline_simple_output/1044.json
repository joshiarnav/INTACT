    "problem": "Ben rolls two fair six-sided dice. What is the expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled? Express your answer as a fraction.  (If the two numbers are the same, we take that number to be the \"larger\" number.)",
    "solution": "There are 36 possible outcomes for the two dice. Of these, there is 1 where both dice roll a six, 5 where the first die rolls a six and the other rolls something less than a six, and 5 more where the second die rolls a six and the first die rolls something less than a six. So, there are a total of $1+5+5=11$ ways the larger number rolled can be a six. Similarly, there are $1+4+4=9$ ways the larger number rolled can be a five, $1+3+3=7$ ways the larger number rolled can be a four, $1+2+2=5$ ways the larger number rolled can be a three, $1+1+1=3$ ways the larger number rolled can be a two, and $1$ way the larger number rolled can be a one. The expected value of the larger number is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{36}(11(6)+9(5)&+7(4)+5(3)+3(2)+1(1))\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{36}(66+45+28+15+6+1)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{161}{36}}\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the possible outcomes when rolling two six-sided dice\nWhen rolling two six-sided dice, there are 36 possible outcomes. These can be represented by ordered pairs (x,y), where x and y are the numbers showing on the first and second die, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of pairs where each possible number appears as the larger number\nFor each number from 1 to 6, we need to count the number of pairs where this number appears as the larger number. If the larger number is 1, the pairs are (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,6). There is 1 pair for 1 and 6 pairs for 2 to 6, totaling 1 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 21 pairs for the larger number being 1 to 6.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the probability of rolling each number as the larger number\nSince the dice are fair, each outcome is equally likely. The probability of rolling each number as the larger number is the number of pairs where this number appears as the larger number divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 36.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the expected value of the larger number\nThe expected value of the larger number can be calculated by adding the product of each possible value and its probability.\n\nLet's list the probabilities for each value: \nP(1) = 1/36, P(2) = 6/36, P(3) = 11/36, P(4) = 16/36, P(5) = 21/36, P(6) = 26/36.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the expected value formula\nThe expected value E is the sum of each possible value multiplied by its probability:\nE = 1 * (1/36) + 2 * (6/36) + 3 * (11/36) + 4 * (16/36) + 5 * (21/36) + 6 * (26/36).\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression and calculate the sum\nE = (1/36) + (12/36) + (33/36) + (64/36) + (105/36) + (156/36).\nE = (371/36).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{371}{36}}$"
