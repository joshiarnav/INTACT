    "problem": "If Michael rolls three fair dice, what is the probability that he will roll at least two 1's? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We calculate the complement, or the probability that Michael does not roll at least two 1's, and then subtract from 1.  If Michael does not roll at least two 1's, he must roll either zero or one.  The probability that he rolls no 1's is  $$\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6} = \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{216}$$The probability that he rolls one 1 is $$\\left(\\binom{3}{1}\\cdot\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\\cdot\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6} = \\binom{3}{1}\\left(\\frac{25}{216}\\right) = \\frac{75}{216},$$since we can choose which of the dice rolled a 1 in $\\binom{3}{1}$ ways.  Thus our answer is $1-\\frac{125}{216}-\\frac{75}{216} = \\frac{16}{216}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{27}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, let's consider the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three fair dice. Each die has six faces, so the total number of possible outcomes is $6^3$.\n\n## Step 2:  Next, we want to find the number of ways Michael can roll at least two 1's. We can break this down into cases. First, let's find the number of ways to roll exactly two 1's. There are three ways this can happen: the first die can be a 1 and the other two are not, the second die can be a 1 and the other two are not, or the third die can be a 1 and the other two are not. In each case, the two non-1 dice can be any of the other five numbers, so there are $3 \\times 5 \\times 5$ ways to roll exactly two 1's.\n\n## Step 3:  Now, we'll find the number of ways to roll exactly three 1's. There is only one way for this to happen: all three dice must be 1's.\n\n## Step 4:  Therefore, the total number of ways to roll at least two 1's is $3 \\times 5 \\times 5 + 1 = 76$.\n\n## Step 5:  We can find the probability of rolling at least two 1's by dividing the number of ways to roll at least two 1's by the total number of possible outcomes, so the probability is $\\frac{76}{6^3}$.\n\n## Step 6:  Simplifying, we get $\\frac{19}{54}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{19}{54}}$"
