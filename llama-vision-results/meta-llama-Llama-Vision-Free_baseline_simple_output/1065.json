    "problem": "The dartboard below has a radius of 6 inches. Each of the concentric circles has a radius two inches less than the next larger circle.

    "solution": "The probability for a single dart to land in the non-shaded region is the ratio of the area of the non-shaded region to the area of the entire dartboard. The area of the entire dartboard is $\\pi \\cdot 6^2 = 36\\pi$. The area of the shaded region is the area of the second largest circle minus the area of the smallest circle, or $\\pi \\cdot 4^2 - \\pi \\cdot 2^2 = 12 \\pi$, so the area of the non-shaded region is $36\\pi - 12\\pi = 24\\pi$. Thus, our ratio is $\\frac{24\\pi}{36\\pi}=\\frac{2}{3}$. If each dart has a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance of landing in a non-shaded region and there are 9 darts, then the expected number of darts that land in a non-shaded region is $9 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\boxed{6}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are given a dartboard with concentric circles, where each circle has a radius two inches less than the next larger circle. The radius of the largest circle is 6 inches, and the shaded region corresponds to the area between the second and third largest circles.\n## Step 2:  To find the area of the shaded region, we can calculate the area of the third largest circle and subtract the area of the second largest circle. The area of a circle is given by $\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.\n## Step 3:  The radius of the third largest circle is $6 + 2 = 8$ inches, and the radius of the second largest circle is $6$ inches.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, the area of the shaded region is $\\pi(8^2) - \\pi(6^2) = 64\\pi - 36\\pi = 28\\pi$ square inches.\n## Step 5:  We can also find the area of the entire dartboard, which is the area of the largest circle, given by $\\pi(10^2) = 100\\pi$ square inches.\n## Step 6:  Now that we know the areas of the entire dartboard and the shaded region, we can determine the area of the non-shaded region, which is the area of the dartboard minus the area of the shaded region, or $100\\pi - 28\\pi = 72\\pi$ square inches.\n## Step 7:  Since nine darts land randomly on the target, we want to find the expected number of darts that would land in a non-shaded region.\n## Step 8:  To find this, we can calculate the ratio of the area of the non-shaded region to the area of the entire dartboard, which is $\\frac{72\\pi}{100\\pi} = \\frac{9}{25}$.\n## Step 9:  Multiplying this ratio by the total number of darts that land on the target, we get $\\frac{9}{25} \\cdot 9 = \\frac{81}{25}$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, we would expect $\\frac{81}{25}$ darts to land in a non-shaded region.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{81}{25}}$"
