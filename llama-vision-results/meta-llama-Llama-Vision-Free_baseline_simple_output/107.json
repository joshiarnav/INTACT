    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is asking us to find the number of ways the coach can select 4 members out of 8 for a contest. This is a combination problem, where the order of selection does not matter.\n\n## Step 2: Use the combination formula\nThe combination formula is C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be selected. In this case, n = 8 and r = 4.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the combination\nUsing the combination formula, we get: C(8, 4) = 8! / (4!(8-4)!) = 8! / (4!4!) = (8*7*6*5) / (4*3*2*1) = 70.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{70}$"
