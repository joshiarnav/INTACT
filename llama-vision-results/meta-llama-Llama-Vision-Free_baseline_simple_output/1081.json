    "problem": "Three couples go to the movie theater. They want to seat people together for maximum enjoyment, but instead they randomly file into a row with six seats. What is the probability that they sit in a socially optimal configuration, in which each person is sitting next to his or her partner?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to pick people to fill the first two seats, and 3 ways for those two people to be a couple, for a probability $3/15 = 1/5$ that the first two seats are a couple. If a couple is seated successfully, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to seat people in the next two seats, and 2 ways for those two people to be a couple (you could pick either of the two remaining couples), for a probability $2/6 = 1/3$ that those two seats are a couple. If the first two couples are seated successfully, the last two seats will be guaranteed to go to the last couple. So, the probability that everything goes right is $1/5 \\cdot 1/3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{15}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of possible seating configurations\nTo find the total number of possible seating configurations, we need to consider the number of permutations of 6 people. Since each person is distinct, the total number of permutations is 6!. This is because there are 6 choices for the first seat, 5 choices for the second seat, 4 choices for the third seat, 3 choices for the fourth seat, 2 choices for the fifth seat, and 1 choice for the sixth seat.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of socially optimal seating configurations\nFor a socially optimal configuration, each couple must sit together. We can think of each couple as a single unit, so there are 3 units in total. These 3 units can be arranged in 3! ways. Additionally, within each couple, the two people can be arranged in 2! ways. Therefore, the total number of socially optimal configurations is 3! * 2! * 2!.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of socially optimal configuration\nThe probability of a socially optimal configuration is the number of socially optimal configurations divided by the total number of possible configurations.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the calculations\nThe total number of possible configurations is 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\nThe number of socially optimal configurations is 3! * 2! * 2! = 6 * 2 * 2 = 24.\nThe probability is 24 / 720.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the probability fraction\nWe can simplify the fraction 24/720 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 24. This gives us 1/30.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{30}}$"
