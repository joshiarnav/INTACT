    "problem": "If you flip a fair coin four times, what is the probability of flipping at least three heads in a row? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The quickest way to solve this problem is to count the number of outomes that have three heads in a row, as we already know very clearly that there are $2^4$ outcomes total. So, HHHH, HHHT, THHH are the only 3 outcomes that have three consecutive heads. So, our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{16}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the possible outcomes when flipping a coin four times.\n## Step 2:  There are $2^4=16$ possible outcomes, as each flip can result in either heads or tails.\n## Step 3:  Next, we need to determine the number of successful outcomes, where we flip at least three heads in a row.\n## Step 4:  To do this, we'll break it down into cases:\n## Step 5:  Case 1: Exactly three heads in a row. There are 4 ways to choose where the last tail occurs, resulting in 4 successful outcomes.\n## Step 6:  Case 2: Four heads in a row. There is only 1 way to achieve this, resulting in 1 successful outcome.\n## Step 7:  By adding the successful outcomes from these cases, we get a total of $1+4=5$ successful outcomes.\n## Step 8:  Now that we have the total successful outcomes and the total possible outcomes, we can calculate the probability by dividing the successful outcomes by the total outcomes.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{5}{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$"
