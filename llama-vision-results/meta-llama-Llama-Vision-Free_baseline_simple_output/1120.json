    "problem": "I draw a card from a standard 52-card deck.  If I draw an Ace, I win 1 dollar.  If I draw a 2 through 10, I win a number of dollars equal to the value of the card.  If I draw a face card (Jack, Queen, or King), I win 20 dollars.  If I draw a $\\clubsuit$, my winnings are doubled, and if I draw a $\\spadesuit$, my winnings are tripled.  (For example, if I draw the $8\\clubsuit$, then I win 16 dollars.)  What would be a fair price to pay to play the game?  Express your answer as a dollar value rounded to the nearest cent.\n\nYour answer should be a number with two digits after the decimal point, like $21.43$.",
    "solution": "Let $E_1$ be the expected winnings if a $\\heartsuit$ or $\\diamondsuit$ is drawn.  Since the probability that any particular rank is drawn is the same for any rank, the expected value is simply the average all the winnings for each rank, so \\[ E_1 = \\frac{1}{13}(\\$1+\\$2+\\cdots+\\$10+(3\\times\\$20)) = \\$\\frac{115}{13}. \\]Let $E_2$ be the expected winnings if a $\\clubsuit$ is drawn and $E_3$ the expected winnings if a $\\spadesuit$ is drawn.  Since drawing a $\\clubsuit$ doubles the winnings and drawing a $\\spadesuit$ triples the winnings, $E_2 = 2E_1$ and $E_3 = 3E_1$.  Since there is an equal chance drawing each of the suits, we can average their expected winnings to find the overall expected winnings.  Therefore the expected winnings are \\[ E = \\frac{1}{4}(E_1 + E_1 + E_2 + E_3) = \\frac{1}{4}(7E_1) = {\\$\\frac{805}{52}}, \\]or about $\\boxed{\\$15.48}$, which is the fair price to pay to play the game.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem describes a game where the winnings are determined by drawing a card from a standard 52-card deck. The winnings are based on the value of the card drawn and can be modified by the suit of the card. We are tasked with finding a fair price to pay to play this game, expressed as a dollar value rounded to the nearest cent.\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we need to first calculate the expected value of playing the game. This involves finding the probability of each possible outcome and multiplying it by the corresponding winnings, then summing these products.\n## Step 3:  We know there are 4 Aces, 4 cards with each rank 2 through 10, and 12 face cards (4 Jacks, 4 Queens, 4 Kings) in a standard 52-card deck. Additionally, there are 13 cards in each suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades).\n## Step 4:  First, let's consider the expected value of drawing an Ace. Since there are 4 Aces, the probability of drawing an Ace is $\\frac{4}{52}$. The winnings for drawing an Ace is $\\$1$, so the expected value for drawing an Ace is $\\frac{4}{52} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{13}$.\n## Step 5:  Next, we consider the expected value of drawing a 2 through 10. There are 4 cards for each rank, so the probability of drawing any one of these cards is $\\frac{16}{52}$. Since the winnings are equal to the value of the card, the expected value for drawing a 2 through 10 is $\\frac{16}{52} \\times \\frac{58}{2} = \\frac{29}{1}$.\n## Step 6:  Then, we look at the expected value of drawing a face card. There are 12 face cards, so the probability of drawing a face card is $\\frac{12}{52}$. The winnings for drawing a face card is $\\$20$, so the expected value for drawing a face card is $\\frac{12}{52} \\times 20 = \\frac{24}{1}$.\n## Step 7:  We also need to consider the effect of doubling and tripling the winnings based on the suit of the card. The probability of drawing a $\\clubsuit$ is $\\frac{13}{52}$, and the probability of drawing a $\\spadesuit$ is $\\frac{13}{52}$. The expected value for doubling the winnings is $\\frac{13}{52} \\times 2 = \\frac{26}{52}$, and the expected value for tripling the winnings is $\\frac{13}{52} \\times 3 = \\frac{39}{52}$.\n## Step 8:  To find the expected value of playing the game, we sum the expected values for each possible outcome.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the expected value of playing the game is $\\frac{1}{13} + \\frac{29}{2} + \\frac{24}{1} + \\frac{26}{52} + \\frac{39}{52} = \\frac{13}{13} + \\frac{145}{2} + \\frac{312}{52} + \\frac{52}{52} + \\frac{39}{52} = \\frac{13}{13} + \\frac{145 \\times 26}{2 \\times 26} + \\frac{312 + 52 + 39}{52} = \\frac{13}{13} + \\frac{3775}{52} + \\frac{403}{52} = \\frac{13 \\times 52 + 3775 + 403 \\times 13}{52 \\times 13} = \\frac{676 + 3775 + 5239}{676} = \\frac{8590}{676} = 12.71$.\n## Step 10:  Rounding to the nearest cent, the fair price to pay to play the game is $\\$12.71$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12.71}$"
