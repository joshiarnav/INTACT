    "problem": "There are 30 men and 40 women in the Town Library Club.  They wish to form a 7-person steering committee with 3 men and 4 women.  In how many ways can they form the committee?",
    "solution": "In this problem, we're really selecting two separate committees.  We can choose 3 men from the 30 men total in $$ \\binom{30}{3} = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 4,\\!060 $$ways, and 4 women from the 40 women total in $$ \\binom{40}{4} = \\frac{40 \\times 39 \\times 38 \\times 37}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 91,\\!390 $$ways.  Since these two selections are independent (since for each of the $4,\\!060$ ways to pick the men, there are $91,\\!390$ ways to pick the women), we multiply them together to get the number of ways that we can form the 7-member overall committee: $$ \\binom{30}{3}\\binom{40}{4} = (4,\\!060)(91,\\!390) = \\boxed{371,\\!043,\\!400}. $$",
