    "problem": "The Coventry School's European debate club has 6 German delegates, 5 French delegates, and 3 Italian delegates.  In how many ways can these 14 delegates sit in a row of 14 chairs, if each country's delegates insist on all sitting next to each other?",
    "solution": "We first think of the German delegates forming a single German block, denoted G, the French delegates forming a single French block F, and the Italian delegates forming a single Italian block I.  Then there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the three blocks in a row: $$ \\text{\\textbf{\\large FGI, FIG, GFI, GIF, IFG, IGF.}} $$ Within each block, there are $6!$ ways to arrange the German delegates, $5!$ ways to arrange the French delegates, and $3!$ ways to arrange the Italian delegates.  Therefore, there are $$ 3! \\times 6! \\times 5! \\times 3! = 6 \\times 720 \\times 120 \\times 6 = \\boxed{3,\\!110,\\!400} $$ ways to seat all 14 delegates.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, we need to consider the arrangement of the three groups of delegates from different countries. Since each country's delegates must sit next to each other, we can think of this as arranging the groups themselves.\n## Step 2:  There are 3 groups of delegates (German, French, and Italian), and these can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. This is because there are 3 choices for the first position, 2 choices for the second position, and 1 choice for the third position, giving us a total of 6 different arrangements of the groups.\n## Step 3:  Next, we need to consider the arrangement of the delegates within each group. There are 6 German delegates, 5 French delegates, and 3 Italian delegates, and each can be arranged in different ways within their respective groups.\n## Step 4:  The 6 German delegates can be arranged in 6! = 720 ways. Similarly, the 5 French delegates can be arranged in 5! = 120 ways, and the 3 Italian delegates can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.\n## Step 5:  Now, we can calculate the total number of ways the delegates can sit in a row of 14 chairs by multiplying the number of arrangements of the groups by the number of arrangements within each group.\n## Step 6:  This gives us 6 * 720 * 120 * 6 = 12441600 arrangements.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the total number of ways the 14 delegates can sit in a row of 14 chairs, with each country's delegates sitting next to each other, is 12441600.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12441600}$"
