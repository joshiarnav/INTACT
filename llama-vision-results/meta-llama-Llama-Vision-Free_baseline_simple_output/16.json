    "problem": "The letters $A, B$ and $C$ are used to form every possible three letter ``word.'' When these ``words'' are arranged in alphabetical order and numbered so that $AAA$ is Word 1 and $CCC$ is Word 27, what number will correspond to the position of word $BAB$ on the list?",
    "solution": "There are 9 possible words that start with A to begin the list, so the first word starting with B, BAA, is the 10th word. BAB is the next word after BAA, or word number $\\boxed{11}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the position of the word $BAB$ on the list, we need to determine how many words come before it in alphabetical order.\n## Step 2:  We know that the total number of three-letter words that can be formed using the letters $A, B$, and $C$ is $27$, and these words are arranged in alphabetical order.\n## Step 3:  The word $BAB$ will be placed after all words that start with $A$ and all words that start with $AB$, where the third letter is either $A$ or $B$.\n## Step 4:  Starting with the words that begin with $A$, we have $AAB, AAC, ABA, ABC, ACC$. These words take up positions 1 through 5, and there are $3$ letters for the last letter of each word.\n## Step 5:  Moving on to the words that start with $AB$, we have $ABA, ABC$. These words take up positions 6 and 7, and there are $2$ letters for the last letter of each word.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, we have a total of $3 \\times 5 + 2 \\times 2 = 17$ words that come before the word $BAB$ in alphabetical order.\n## Step 7:  Since the total number of words is 27, $BAB$ will be in the $27 - 17 = 10$th position on the list.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
