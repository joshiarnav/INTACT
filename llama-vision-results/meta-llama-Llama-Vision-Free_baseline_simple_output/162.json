    "problem": "A complete cycle of a traffic light takes 60 seconds. During each cycle the light is green for 25 seconds, yellow for 5 seconds, and red for 30 seconds. At a randomly chosen time, what is the probability that the light will NOT be green?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that it will be green is $\\frac{25}{60}=\\frac{5}{12}$. So the probability that it is not green is simply $1-\\frac{5}{12}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{12}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total duration of the traffic light cycle.\nThe total duration of the traffic light cycle is given as 60 seconds.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the duration for which the light is green.\nThe light is green for 25 seconds during each cycle.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability that the light will NOT be green.\nTo find the probability that the light will NOT be green, we subtract the duration for which the light is green from the total cycle duration, which gives us 60 - 25 = 35 seconds. Then we divide this by the total duration of the cycle, which is 60 seconds.\n\n## Step 4: Express the probability as a common fraction.\nThe probability that the light will NOT be green is therefore 35/60. Simplifying this fraction, we get 7/12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{12}}$"
