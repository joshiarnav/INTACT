    "problem": "Two different 2-digit numbers are randomly chosen and multiplied together.  What is the probability that the resulting product is even?",
    "solution": "Here an `outcome' is selecting two different 2-digit numbers, without regard to order.  There are 90 2-digit numbers, so this can be done in $\\binom{90}{2} = 4005$ ways.\n\nNow we need to count the successful outcomes.  Two numbers multiply together to give an even number if at least one of the original numbers is even.  To count this will require some casework.  However, casework makes us think about using complementary counting here.  We see that it's easier to count when the product of two numbers is odd: this happens when both original numbers are odd.\n\nThere are 45 odd 2-digit numbers, so two of them can be chosen in $\\binom{45}{2}= 990$ ways.  These are the unsuccessful outcomes, so there are $4005-990 = 3015$ successful outcomes.  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{3015}{4005} = \\boxed{\\frac{67}{89}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are tasked with finding the probability that the product of two different 2-digit numbers is even.\n## Step 2:  First, we need to understand what makes a product even. A product is even if at least one of the factors is even.\n## Step 3:  To calculate the probability, we can take the complement approach, i.e., find the probability that the product is odd and then subtract it from 1.\n## Step 4:  For the product to be odd, both factors must be odd. Since there are 45 odd 2-digit numbers (ranging from 11 to 99), we can calculate the total number of ways to choose two odd numbers from this set.\n## Step 5:  Using combinations, we have $\\binom{45}{2}=990$ ways to choose two odd numbers.\n## Step 6:  The total number of ways to choose two 2-digit numbers (without regard to order) can be found using combinations as well, which gives us $\\binom{90}{2}=4,005$.\n## Step 7:  Now that we have the number of successful outcomes (990) and the total possible outcomes (4,005), we can calculate the probability of the product being odd.\n## Step 8:  This probability is given by $\\dfrac{990}{4005} = \\dfrac{9 \\cdot 110}{9 \\cdot 445} = \\dfrac{110}{445}$.\n## Step 9:  Finally, to find the probability of the product being even, we subtract the probability of the product being odd from 1, giving us $1 - \\dfrac{110}{445} = \\dfrac{335}{445} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{67}{89}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{67}{89}}$"
