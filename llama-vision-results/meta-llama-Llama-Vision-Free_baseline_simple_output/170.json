    "problem": "Suppose you have a weighted coin in which heads comes up with probability $\\frac34$ and tails with probability $\\frac14$.  If you flip heads, you win 2 dollars, but if you flip tails, you lose 1 dollar.  What is the expected value of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal.",
    "solution": "By definition, we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities, and add them up: $E = \\frac34(+\\$2) + \\frac14(-\\$1) = \\$1.50 - \\$0.25 = \\boxed{\\$1.25}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the probability of flipping heads\nThe probability of flipping heads is given as $\\frac34$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of flipping tails\nThe probability of flipping tails is given as $\\frac14$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the winnings for each outcome\nIf heads comes up, the winnings are $2. If tails comes up, the winnings are $-1.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the expected value of a coin flip\nThe expected value is the sum of the product of each outcome's probability and its corresponding winnings. So, the expected value $E = (\\frac34 \\times 2) + (\\frac14 \\times -1)$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression for the expected value\n$E = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 2 + \\frac{1}{4} \\times -1 = \\frac{6}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{5}{4}$.\n\n## Step 6: Express the expected value as a decimal\n$\\frac{5}{4}$ as a decimal is $1.25$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.25}$"
