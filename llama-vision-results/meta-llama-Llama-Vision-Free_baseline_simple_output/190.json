    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are asked to find the number of ways to select 5 students from a group of 6 students.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the type of problem\nThis is a combination problem, because the order in which the students are selected does not matter.\n\n## Step 3: Use the combination formula\nThe combination formula is nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to be selected.\n\n## Step 4: Plug in the values\nWe have n = 6 (total number of students) and r = 5 (number of students to be selected).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the combination\n6C5 = 6! / (5!(6-5)!) = 6! / (5!1!) = 6.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression\n6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720, 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120, and 1! = 1. So, 6C5 = 720 / (120*1) = 720 / 120 = 6.\n\n## Step 7: Write the final answer\nThere are 6 ways to select 5 students from a group of 6 students.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
