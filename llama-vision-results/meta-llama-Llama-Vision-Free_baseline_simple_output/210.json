    "problem": "In a math class of 30 students, 12 out of 15 girls are freshmen and 11 out of 15 boys are freshmen. What is the probability that in a randomly selected group of five students from the class, there will be two freshmen girls and three freshmen boys? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest thousandth.",
    "solution": "We can choose 2 freshmen girls and 3 freshman boys in $\\binom{12}{2}\\binom{11}{3} = 10890$ ways.  There are a total of $\\binom{30}{5} = 142506$ possible groups of 5 students we can choose.  Thus the probability of selecting a group of 5 students with 2 freshman girls and 3 freshmen boys is $\\frac{10890}{142506} \\approx \\boxed{0.076}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of girls in the class\nThere are 15 girls in the class.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of freshmen girls in the class\n12 out of 15 girls are freshmen, so 12/15 = 0.8 or 80% of the girls are freshmen.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of boys in the class\nThere are 30 - 15 = 15 boys in the class.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of freshmen boys in the class\n11 out of 15 boys are freshmen, so 11/15 = 0.7333 or 73.33% of the boys are freshmen.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of freshmen in the class\nThe total number of freshmen in the class can be calculated as (12/15) x 15 + (11/15) x 15 = 12 + 11 = 23.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to select 2 freshmen girls from the class\nThe number of ways to select 2 freshmen girls from the 12 freshmen girls is given by the combination formula C(12, 2) = 12! / (2! * (12 - 2)!) = 66.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of ways to select 3 freshmen boys from the class\nThe number of ways to select 3 freshmen boys from the 11 freshmen boys is given by the combination formula C(11, 3) = 11! / (3! * (11 - 3)!) = 165.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the number of ways to select 5 students from the class\nThe number of ways to select 5 students from the 30 students in the class is given by the combination formula C(30, 5) = 30! / (5! * (30 - 5)!) = 142,506.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the number of ways to select 2 freshmen girls and 3 freshmen boys\nThe total number of ways to select 2 freshmen girls and 3 freshmen boys is the product of the number of ways to select the girls and the number of ways to select the boys, i.e., 66 * 165 = 10,890.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the probability of selecting 2 freshmen girls and 3 freshmen boys\nThe probability of selecting 2 freshmen girls and 3 freshmen boys is the total number of ways to select 2 freshmen girls and 3 freshmen boys divided by the total number of ways to select 5 students, i.e., 10,890 / 142,506.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the final probability as a decimal to the nearest thousandth\nThe final probability is 10,890 / 142,506 \u2248 0.0764.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.076}$"
