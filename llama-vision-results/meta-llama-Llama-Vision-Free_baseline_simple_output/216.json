    "problem": "A Senate committee has 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats.  In how many ways can we form a subcommittee of 5 members that has at least one member from each party?",
    "solution": "There are a total of $\\binom{14}{5}=2002$ ways of selecting a subcommittee of 5 with no restrictions on the membership. Of these committees, the only ones that will violate the given condition are the ones that consist entirely of Republicans or entirely of Democrats. There are $\\binom{8}{5}=56$ possible subcommittees that have all 5 members selected from among the 8 Republicans and $\\binom{6}{5}=6$ possible subcommittees that have all 5 members selected from among the 6 Democrats. Subtracting the number of subcommittees that don't work from the total number of possible subcommittees gives us our answer: $2002-56-6=\\boxed{1940}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways we can form a subcommittee of 5 members that has at least one member from each party.\n## Step 2:  Since we have to have at least one member from each party, we start by calculating the number of ways to select the members.\n## Step 3:  First, we consider the case where we select 1 Republican and 4 Democrats. The number of ways to choose 1 Republican from 8 Republicans is given by 8 choose 1, denoted as $\\binom{8}{1}$.\n## Step 4:  Similarly, the number of ways to choose 4 Democrats from 6 Democrats is given by 6 choose 4, denoted as $\\binom{6}{4}$.\n## Step 5:  Multiplying these two values gives us the total number of ways to select 1 Republican and 4 Democrats, which is $\\binom{8}{1}\\binom{6}{4}=8\\cdot 15=120$.\n## Step 6:  Next, we consider the case where we select 2 Republicans and 3 Democrats. The number of ways to choose 2 Republicans from 8 Republicans is given by 8 choose 2, denoted as $\\binom{8}{2}$.\n## Step 7:  Similarly, the number of ways to choose 3 Democrats from 6 Democrats is given by 6 choose 3, denoted as $\\binom{6}{3}$.\n## Step 8:  Multiplying these two values gives us the total number of ways to select 2 Republicans and 3 Democrats, which is $\\binom{8}{2}\\binom{6}{3}=28\\cdot 20=560$.\n## Step 9:  Finally, we consider the case where we select 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats. The number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8 Republicans is given by 8 choose 3, denoted as $\\binom{8}{3}$.\n## Step 10:  Similarly, the number of ways to choose 2 Democrats from 6 Democrats is given by 6 choose 2, denoted as $\\binom{6}{2}$.\n## Step 11:  Multiplying these two values gives us the total number of ways to select 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats, which is $\\binom{8}{3}\\binom{6}{2}=56\\cdot 15=840$.\n## Step 12:  To find the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that has at least one member from each party, we add the results from all these cases: $120 + 560 + 840 = 1520$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1520}$"
