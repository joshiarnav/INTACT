    "problem": "In a class of 20 students, all but 4 of the students put their names on a typed assignment. If the teacher randomly guesses, what is the probability that she correctly guesses which paper belongs to each of the four remaining students? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that the teacher guesses the first student's paper correctly is $\\frac{1}{4}$.  Given that the first guess is correct, the probability that she guesses the second student's paper correctly is $\\frac{1}{3}$.  Given that both of the first two guesses were correct, the probability that she guesses the third student's paper correctly is $\\frac{1}{2}$.  If the first three are correct, then the fourth will be correct with probability $1$.  The probability that all four guesses will be correct is $\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{24}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are given that in a class of 20 students, all but 4 students put their names on a typed assignment.\n## Step 2:  The teacher needs to randomly guess which paper belongs to each of the four remaining students, and we need to find the probability of her correctly guessing all 4.\n## Step 3:  To start, let's consider the number of ways the teacher can guess the names for these 4 students. Since there are 16 students who have already put their names on the assignment, these 4 students can be assigned any of the 16 names, so there are $16^4$ ways to assign the names.\n## Step 4:  However, we are interested in the number of ways in which the teacher can correctly guess the names of the 4 students. Since each of these 4 students must be assigned their own correct name, there is only one correct ordering out of the $16^4$ possible orderings.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the probability of the teacher correctly guessing which paper belongs to each of the 4 remaining students is given by the ratio of the number of successful outcomes (correct guesses) to the total number of possible outcomes.\n## Step 6:  This can be calculated as $\\frac{1}{16^4} = \\frac{1}{65536}$.\n## Step 7:  Hence, the probability of the teacher correctly guessing all 4 students is $\\frac{1}{65536}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{65536}}$"
