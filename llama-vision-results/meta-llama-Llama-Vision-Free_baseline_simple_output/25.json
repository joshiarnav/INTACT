    "problem": "Bob plays a game where, for some number $n$, he chooses a random integer between 0 and $n-1$, inclusive. If Bob plays this game for each of the first four prime numbers, what is the probability that the sum of the numbers he gets is greater than 0?",
    "solution": "The first four primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The only way for the sum of the numbers Bob gets to not be greater than 0 is if he gets a 0 each time he plays the game. The chance that Bob will get a 0 each time he plays is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7}=\\frac{1}{210}$. Therefore, the probability that Bob will not get all 0's is $1-\\frac{1}{210}=\\boxed{\\frac{209}{210}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, we need to identify the first four prime numbers.\nThe first four prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 2:  Next, we'll calculate the total number of possible outcomes when Bob chooses a random integer for each of the first four prime numbers.\nFor the first prime number (2), there are 2 possible integers (0, 1). For the second prime number (3), there are 3 possible integers (0, 1, 2). For the third prime number (5), there are 5 possible integers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). For the fourth prime number (7), there are 7 possible integers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 = 210$.\n\n## Step 3:  Now, we need to determine the number of outcomes where the sum of the numbers Bob gets is greater than 0.\nIt's evident that if Bob gets 0 on any of the first three prime numbers, the sum will not be greater than 0, because 0 + (number from the fourth prime number) will not be greater than 0. Therefore, we'll find the number of outcomes where Bob doesn't get 0 on the first three prime numbers and multiply it by the number of outcomes where Bob gets any number other than 0 on the fourth prime number.\n\n## Step 4:  The following cases need to be considered:\n- Case 1: Bob gets 1 on the first prime number.\n- Case 2: Bob gets 1 on the first prime number and Bob gets 1, 2, or 3 on the second prime number.\n- Case 3: Bob gets 1 on the first prime number and Bob gets 1, 2, or 3 on the second prime number and Bob gets 1, 2, 3, or 4 on the third prime number.\n- Case 4: Bob gets 1 on the first prime number and Bob gets 1, 2, or 3 on the second prime number and Bob gets 1, 2, 3, or 4 on the third prime number and Bob gets 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 on the fourth prime number.\n\n## Step 5:  Now, we'll determine the number of successful outcomes for each of the four cases:\n- Case 1: There are $1 \\times 2 \\times 5 \\times 7 = 70$ successful outcomes.\n- Case 2: There are $1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 = 210$ successful outcomes.\n- Case 3: There are $1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 7 = 840$ successful outcomes.\n- Case 4: There are $1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 6 \\times 7 = 2520$ successful outcomes.\n\n## Step 6:  We'll sum up the successful outcomes for each of the four cases.\nThe total number of successful outcomes is $70 + 210 + 840 + 2520 = 3740$.\n\n## Step 7:  Finally, we'll calculate the probability by dividing the total number of successful outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\nThe probability that the sum of the numbers Bob gets is greater than 0 is $\\frac{3740}{210}$.\n\n## Step 8:  Simplify the fraction.\n$\\frac{3740}{210} = \\frac{748}{42}$\n\n## Step 9:  Simplify the fraction further.\n$\\frac{748}{42} = \\frac{374}{21}$\n\n## Step 10:  Simplify the fraction further.\n$\\frac{374}{21} = 17.809523809524$, rounded to 6 decimal places. However, the original problem asked for an exact answer. Let's simplify the fraction exactly.\n$\\frac{374}{21}$ cannot be simplified exactly, so let's keep it as is.\n\n## Step 11:  However, we can simplify the fraction further by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1, but the numerator and denominator are not divisible, but we can simplify the fraction further to a mixed number $\\frac{17}{1} + \\frac{7}{21}$.\nHowever, we will simplify the fraction to an improper fraction, we just need to divide the numerator by the denominator to get the result of the fraction, then we will get the result of the fraction.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{374}{21}}$"
