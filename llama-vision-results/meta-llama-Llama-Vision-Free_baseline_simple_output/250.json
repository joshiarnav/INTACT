    "problem": "Link is coloring a triforce, which consists of four equilateral triangles and is depicted below. He has three colors to use: gold, black, and green. So that it remains recognizable, he doesn't want to color any two triangles the same color if they share a side. How many different ways can he color the triforce? (Two colorings that differ by rotation are considered distinct.) [asy]\nsize(50);\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(1,1.732)--cycle);\ndraw((1,0)--(1.5,.866)--(.5,.866)--cycle);\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "There are 3 ways to choose a color for the center.  Once the center color is chosen, for each of the remaining triangles there are 2 ways to choose a color (any color except the center color).  Therefore, there are $3\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2 = \\boxed{24}$ ways to color the triforce.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem\nLink needs to color a triforce consisting of four equilateral triangles using three colors: gold, black, and green. The constraint is that no two triangles that share a side can be the same color.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the key elements of the triforce\nThe triforce is made up of four equilateral triangles, and each triangle shares a side with its adjacent triangles.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the coloring scheme\nGiven the constraint, Link can color the top triangle in one of three colors. Once the color of the top triangle is chosen, the colors of the adjacent triangles are determined to be different from the top triangle.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the rotation of the triforce\nSince two colorings that differ by rotation are considered distinct, we need to account for the rotational symmetry of the triforce. There are three possible rotations of the triforce: 0 degrees, 120 degrees, and 240 degrees.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of different colorings\nFor the top triangle, there are 3 possible colors. Once the color of the top triangle is chosen, the colors of the adjacent triangles are determined. Therefore, for each rotation, there is only 1 possible coloring of the triforce.\n\n## Step 6: Account for the total number of rotations\nSince there are 3 possible rotations of the triforce, we need to multiply the number of colorings for each rotation by 3.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the final number of different ways Link can color the triforce\nSince there is only 1 possible coloring for each rotation, and there are 3 rotations, the total number of different ways Link can color the triforce is 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
