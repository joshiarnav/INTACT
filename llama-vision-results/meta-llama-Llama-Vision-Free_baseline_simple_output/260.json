    "problem": "A row of 8 light switches controls different banks of lights in a school gymnasium. In preparation for a school dance, students decide that they want either one or two banks of lights on during the dance. How many possible ways are there of setting these 8 switches so that either one or two banks of lights are on?",
    "solution": "There are two cases here. If one bank of lights is on, there are $\\binom{8}{1}=8$ ways to choose which bank of lights it is. If two banks of lights are on, there are $\\binom{8}{2}=28$ ways to choose which banks of lights they are. The total number of valid settings is $8+28=\\boxed{36}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the possible scenarios for one or two banks of lights to be on.\nTo solve this problem, we need to figure out the possible combinations where either one or two banks of lights are on. This means we have two scenarios: one bank of lights on, and two banks of lights on.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to have one bank of lights on.\nFor one bank of lights to be on, we need to select 1 out of the 8 switches to be in the \"on\" position. This is a combination problem, where the order of selection does not matter. The number of ways to choose 1 switch out of 8 is given by the combination formula: C(8,1) = 8! / (1!(8-1)!) = 8.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to have two banks of lights on.\nFor two banks of lights to be on, we need to select 2 out of the 8 switches to be in the \"on\" position. This is also a combination problem. The number of ways to choose 2 switches out of 8 is given by the combination formula: C(8,2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 28.\n\n## Step 4: Add the number of ways for one bank and two banks to be on to get the total number of possible ways.\nTo find the total number of possible ways to set the switches so that either one or two banks of lights are on, we need to add the number of ways for one bank to be on and the number of ways for two banks to be on. This is 8 + 28.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the sum of the number of ways for one bank and two banks to be on.\n8 + 28 = 36.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$"
