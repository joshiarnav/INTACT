    "problem": "Ben flips a fair nickel four times. What is the probability that Ben flips Head, Tail, Head, Tail, in that order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Since any given flip has equal probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of being a Head or a Tail, and all outcomes are equally likely, the precise sequence given is equal to $\\frac{1}{2^4} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the total number of outcomes for flipping a nickel four times.\nEach flip of a nickel has two possible outcomes: Head or Tail. Since Ben flips the nickel four times, the total number of outcomes is $2^4 = 16$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the specific sequence of outcomes Ben is looking for.\nBen wants to flip Head, Tail, Head, Tail in that order. This means there is only one specific sequence that matches his desired outcome.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the probability of flipping the desired sequence.\nTo find the probability, we divide the number of desired outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, there is only 1 desired outcome (the specific sequence Head, Tail, Head, Tail) and 16 possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability as a common fraction.\nProbability = $\\frac{number\\ of\\ desired\\ outcomes}{total\\ number\\ of\\ possible\\ outcomes} = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$"
