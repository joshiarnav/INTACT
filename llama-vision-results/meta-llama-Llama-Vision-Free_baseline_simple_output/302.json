    "problem": "What is the remainder when $301^4$ is divided by 10,000?",
    "solution": "By the Binomial Theorem, we have  \\begin{align*}\n301^4 &= (3(100) + 1)^4\\\\\n&= \\binom40 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 100^4 \\cdot 1^0 + \\binom41 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 100^3 \\cdot 1^1 \\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad+ \\binom42 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 100^2 \\cdot 1^2+ \\binom43 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 100^1 \\cdot 1^3 \\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad+ \\binom44 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 100^0 \\cdot 1^4.\n\\end{align*} All but the last two terms are divisible by $10000=100^2$, so we only have to consider the remainder when the last two terms are divided by 10,000. The last two terms are  \\begin{align*}\n\\binom43 &\\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 100^1 \\cdot 1^3 + \\binom44 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 100^0 \\cdot 1^4\\\\\n&= 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1\\\\\n& = 1200 + 1 = \\boxed{1201}.\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem requires finding the remainder when $301^4$ is divided by 10,000.\n## Step 2:  We can start by finding the remainder when 301 is divided by 100, which will help us simplify the calculation.\n## Step 3:  Since 301 divided by 100 leaves a remainder of 1, we can express 301 as 100q + 1, where q is the quotient when 301 is divided by 100.\n## Step 4:  Now, we can use the binomial expansion of $(100q+1)^4$ to find the remainder when $301^4$ is divided by 10,000.\n## Step 5:  Using the binomial expansion formula, we get $(100q+1)^4 = 100^4q^4 + 4\\cdot 100^3q^3 + 6\\cdot 100^2q^2 + 4\\cdot 100q + 1$.\n## Step 6:  We are interested in the remainder when this expression is divided by 10,000, which is equivalent to $10^4$.\n## Step 7:  The terms in the expansion that do not affect the remainder when divided by 10,000 are $100^4q^4$, $4\\cdot 100^3q^3$, $6\\cdot 100^2q^2$, and $4\\cdot 100q$.\n## Step 8:  When we divide these terms by 10,000, they all leave a remainder of 0.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the remainder when $(100q+1)^4$ is divided by 10,000 is the same as the remainder when 1 is divided by 10,000.\n## Step 10:  Since 1 is already less than 10,000, the remainder is simply 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
