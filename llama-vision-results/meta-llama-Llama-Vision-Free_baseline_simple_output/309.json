    "problem": "A team averages 7 losses for every 13 games it wins. If ties are not permitted, what is the probability that the team will win its next game? Express your answer as a percent.",
    "solution": "If a team averages 7 losses for 13 wins, that means the team wins 13 out of 20 games, and $\\frac{13}{20} = .65$, or $\\boxed{65\\%}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the ratio of wins to losses\nThe team averages 7 losses for every 13 games it wins, which gives us a ratio of wins to losses of 13:7.\n\n## Step 2: Express the ratio as a fraction\nWe can express the ratio as a fraction, which is 13/20. This fraction represents the total number of games won out of the total number of games played, which is 20.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the probability of winning the next game\nSince the total number of games is 20 (13 wins + 7 losses), the probability of winning is 13/20.\n\n## Step 4: Convert the fraction to a percent\nTo express the probability as a percent, we can convert the fraction to a decimal and then multiply by 100.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the decimal equivalent of the fraction\nThe decimal equivalent of 13/20 is 0.65.\n\n## Step 6: Multiply the decimal by 100\nMultiplying 0.65 by 100 gives us 65%.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{65}$"
