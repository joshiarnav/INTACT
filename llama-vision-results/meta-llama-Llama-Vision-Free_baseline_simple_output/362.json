    "problem": "For how many positive integer values of $n$ is $3^n$ a factor of $15!$?",
    "solution": "We first determine the largest positive integer value of $n$ such that $3^n | 15!$. We determine this by counting the number of factors of 3 in the product.  There are 5 multiples of 3 in the product, and there is one extra factor of 3 in 9, so there are a total of  $5+ 1 = \\boxed{6}$ factors of 3 in the product of the first 15 integers. So, for all $n$ between 1 and 6, inclusive, $3^n$ is a factor of 15!.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are tasked with finding the number of positive integer values of $n$ for which $3^n$ is a factor of $15!$.\n## Step 2:  To begin solving this problem, we need to understand the prime factorization of $15!$, which is the product of all positive integers up to $15$. The prime factorization of $15!$ will contain multiple factors of $3$, as we are interested in the power of $3$ that divides $15!$.\n## Step 3:  To find the highest power of $3$ that divides $15!$, we can calculate the number of factors of $3$ in the prime factorization of all the numbers from $1$ to $15$.\n## Step 4:  We know that $15 = 3 \\cdot 5$, and $10 = 2 \\cdot 5$, so in the prime factorization of $15!$, the number of factors of $3$ will be the sum of the number of times $3$ appears in the prime factorization of all the numbers from $1$ to $15$.\n## Step 5:  This gives us a total of $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{15}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{15}{9} \\right\\rfloor = 5 + 1 = 6$ factors of $3$ in the prime factorization of $15!$.\n## Step 6:  Hence, the highest power of $3$ that divides $15!$ is $3^6$.\n## Step 7:  Now that we know the highest power of $3$ that divides $15!$ is $3^6$, we need to find the positive integer values of $n$ for which $3^n$ is a factor of $15!$. This means we need to find all $n$ such that $3^n$ divides $15!$.\n## Step 8:  Based on our calculation, we know that $3^n$ is a factor of $15!$ if and only if $n$ is less than or equal to $6$.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, we need to count the number of positive integers $n$ that satisfy this condition.\n## Step 10:  The positive integers $n$ that satisfy the condition are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5,$ and $6$.\n## Step 11:  So, the number of positive integer values of $n$ for which $3^n$ is a factor of $15!$ is $\\boxed{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
