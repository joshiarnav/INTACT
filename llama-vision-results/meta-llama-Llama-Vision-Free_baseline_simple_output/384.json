    "model_solution": "## Step 1: We need to determine the number of ways a 3-person committee can be chosen from a group of 8 people.\nThe order in which the committee members are chosen does not matter.\n\n## Step 2: To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula.\nThe combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of people and k is the number of people in the committee.\n\n## Step 3: We can plug in the values into the combination formula.\nn = 8 (total number of people), k = 3 (number of people in the committee).\n\n## Step 4: We can calculate the number of combinations using the formula.\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 8! / (3!5!).\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the factorial expressions in the formula.\n8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40320,\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6,\n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n\n## Step 6: Plug in the simplified factorial expressions into the formula.\nC(8, 3) = 40320 / (6 * 120).\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression by dividing the numerator by the denominator.\nC(8, 3) = 40320 / (6 * 120) = 40320 / 720.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the result of the division.\nC(8, 3) = 40320 / 720 = 56.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{56}$"
