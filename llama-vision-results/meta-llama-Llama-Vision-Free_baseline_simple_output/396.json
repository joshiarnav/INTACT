    "problem": "We roll a fair 6-sided die 5 times.  What is the probability that we get a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls?",
    "solution": "The number of ways to roll exactly 2 6's is $\\binom{5}{2}5^3$, since there are $\\binom{5}{2}$ choices for which of the two dice are 6, and there are 5 choices for each of the other 3 dice. Similarly, the number of ways to roll exactly 1 6 is $\\binom{5}{1}5^4$, and the number of ways to roll no 6's is $\\binom{5}{0}5^5$. So the probability is \\[\\frac{\\binom{5}{2}5^3+\\binom{5}{1}5^4+\\binom{5}{0}5^5}{6^5}=\\boxed{\\frac{625}{648}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of outcomes for rolling a 6-sided die 5 times\nWhen rolling a 6-sided die 5 times, there are $6^5 = 7776$ possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to get a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls\nTo get a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls, we can either get a 6 in exactly 0 of the rolls, or a 6 in exactly 1 of the rolls, or a 6 in exactly 2 of the rolls.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to get a 6 in exactly 0 of the rolls\nThe number of ways to get a 6 in exactly 0 of the rolls is equal to the number of ways to get any number that is not 6 in all 5 rolls, which is $5^5 = 3125$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to get a 6 in exactly 1 of the rolls\nThe number of ways to get a 6 in exactly 1 of the rolls is equal to the number of ways to choose 1 roll out of 5, which is $\\binom{5}{1} = 5$, multiplied by the number of ways to get a 6 in 1 roll and any number that is not 6 in the other 4 rolls, which is $6 \\cdot 5^4 = 1500$. Therefore, the total number of ways to get a 6 in exactly 1 of the rolls is $5 \\cdot 1500 = 7500$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to get a 6 in exactly 2 of the rolls\nThe number of ways to get a 6 in exactly 2 of the rolls is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 rolls out of 5, which is $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$, multiplied by the number of ways to get a 6 in 2 rolls and any number that is not 6 in the other 3 rolls, which is $6 \\cdot 5^3 = 750$. Therefore, the total number of ways to get a 6 in exactly 2 of the rolls is $10 \\cdot 750 = 7500$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of ways to get a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls\nThe total number of ways to get a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls is $3125 + 7500 + 7500 = 18125$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls\nThe probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls is equal to the total number of ways to get a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls divided by the total number of outcomes, which is $\\frac{18125}{7776}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{18125}{7776}}$"
