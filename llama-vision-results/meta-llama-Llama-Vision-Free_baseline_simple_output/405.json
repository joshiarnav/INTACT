    "problem": "In the game of Twister, a spinner randomly selects either an arm or a leg, and also selects one of four colors, one of which is red, each with equal probability, and players have to move the appropriate body part to the appropriately colored spot on the ground. There are four players. Each player spins once, and makes the move the spinner selects. What is the probability that in these four spins, there will be exactly two moves to a red spot, and the body part selected to move will be an arm exactly $3$ times?",
    "solution": "There are  $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to pick which $2$ of the $4$ spins will come up red. Each spin has a $1/4$ chance of coming up red, and $3/4$ chance of not coming up red, so once we pick which $2$ spins we want to come up red, there is a $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{\\!2}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{\\!2}$ chance that the two spins we pick come up red and the other two do not. So, there is a $$6\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{\\!2}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{\\!2}=\\frac{27}{128}$$chance that exactly $2$ come up red.\n\nThere are  $\\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways to pick which 3 of the 4 spins will point to an arm. Each spin has a $1/2$ chance of pointing to an arm, and $1/2$ chance of not pointing to an arm, so once we pick which $3$ spins we want to point to an arm, there is a $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!3}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!1}$ chance that the three spins we pick come up arm and the other one does not. So, there is a $$4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!3}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!1} = \\frac{1}{4}$$chance that exactly $3$ spins point to an arm.\n\nThe color selection and limb selection are independent events, so the probability that they both happen is the product of their individual probabilities; $\\frac{27}{128} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{512}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, let's understand the basic probabilities involved in the game.\nThe spinner can select either an arm or a leg and one of four colors, with each selection being equally probable.\n\n## Step 2: The probability of selecting a red color is 1 out of 4, or 1/4.\nSince there are four colors and each is equally likely to be selected, the probability of landing on a red spot is 1/4.\n\n## Step 3: The probability of selecting an arm is 1 out of 2, or 1/2.\nSince the spinner selects either an arm or a leg, and each option is equally probable, the chance of selecting an arm is 1/2.\n\n## Step 4: The probability of selecting an arm exactly 3 times in 4 spins involves combinations.\nWe need to find the number of ways to choose 3 out of 4 spins to be an arm, which is given by the combination formula C(4, 3) = 4.\n\n## Step 5: For each of these combinations, the probability of selecting an arm exactly 3 times is (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^1 = (1/2)^4 = 1/16.\nSince we are selecting an arm 3 times and a leg once, and each spin is independent, we multiply the probabilities of each event.\n\n## Step 6: Now, we need to find the probability of exactly two moves to a red spot.\nThere are 4 ways to choose which 2 of the 4 spins are to the red spot, and the probability of each of these choices is (1/4)^2 * (3/4)^2 = 9/256.\n\n## Step 7: To find the total probability of exactly two moves to a red spot and an arm exactly 3 times, we multiply the probabilities from step 5 and step 6.\nThe probability is C(4, 3) * (1/16) * 9/256 = 4 * 9/4096 = 36/4096 = 9/1024.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the fraction.\nThe fraction 9/1024 cannot be simplified further.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{1024}}$"
