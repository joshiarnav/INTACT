    "problem": "A drawer contains 3 white balls and 6 black balls.  Two balls are drawn out of the box at random.  What is the probability that they both are white?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ combinations of two balls that can be drawn.  There are $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ combinations of two white balls that can be drawn.  So the probability that two balls pulled out are both white is $\\dfrac{3}{36} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{12}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the total number of balls in the drawer.\nThere are 3 white balls and 6 black balls, making a total of 9 balls.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 9.\nThis can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n - r)!], where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to choose. For this problem, n = 9 and r = 2, so the total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 9 is C(9, 2) = 9! / [2!(9 - 2)!] = 36.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to draw 2 white balls out of 3.\nUsing the combination formula again, we calculate C(3, 2) = 3! / [2!(3 - 2)!] = 3.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of drawing 2 white balls.\nThe probability is the number of ways to draw 2 white balls divided by the total number of ways to draw 2 balls. This is 3 / 36.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the probability fraction.\n3 / 36 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. This gives us 1 / 12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$"
