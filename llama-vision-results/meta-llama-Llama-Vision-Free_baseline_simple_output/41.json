    "problem": "An ant is walking on a hexagon. At each step, he moves from the vertex on which he is standing to an adjacent vertex. After $15$ steps, what is the probability that he is standing on the same vertex on which he began?",
    "solution": "There are two ways in which the ant can return to his original vertex: either he can go part of the way around the hexagon and then retrace his steps, or he can go all the way around the hexagon. In the first case, the ant necessarily moves an even number of steps, because his total number of steps is twice the number of steps needed to get to the point at which he begins to retrace. In the second case, because a hexagon has an even number of vertices, the ant is again moving an even number of steps. Thus, he has no way to return to the vertex on which he began in an odd number of steps, so the probability is $\\boxed{0}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the nature of the ant's movement and how it relates to the vertices of the hexagon.\n## Step 2:  The ant moves from one vertex to an adjacent vertex at each step. We are interested in finding the probability that after 15 steps, the ant is standing on the same vertex where it began.\n## Step 3:  Since the ant starts and ends on the same vertex, it must have made an even number of clockwise and counterclockwise turns in total, and the number of clockwise turns must be equal to the number of counterclockwise turns.\n## Step 4:  This means that the only valid sequences of moves will have the same number of clockwise and counterclockwise turns, and this number must be even.\n## Step 5:  Let's denote the number of clockwise turns as $c$ and the number of counterclockwise turns as $cc$.\n## Step 6:  We know that $c = cc$ and that $c+cc = 15$.\n## Step 7:  We can solve for $c$ to find that $c = cc = \\frac{15}{2}$, but since $c$ and $cc$ must be integers, this implies that $c = cc = 7$ or $c = cc = 9$.\n## Step 8:  However, we also know that the total number of turns must be even, so if $c = 7$ and $cc = 8$ is not a valid solution, then $c = cc = 9$.\n## Step 9:  Now, we need to understand the possible number of ways the ant can make these turns and return to the same vertex.\n## Step 10:  The ant can make 9 clockwise turns and 6 counterclockwise turns, or 9 counterclockwise turns and 6 clockwise turns.\n## Step 11:  The total number of ways to arrange these turns can be calculated using combinations, denoted as $\\binom{n}{r}$, where $n$ is the total number of turns and $r$ is the number of one type of turn.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, we can calculate the total number of valid sequences using $\\binom{15}{9}$, which represents the number of ways to choose 9 clockwise turns out of the 15 total turns.\n## Step 13:  This gives us the total number of valid sequences of moves that result in the ant returning to the starting vertex.\n## Step 14:  Now, we can find the probability by dividing the number of valid sequences by the total number of possible sequences.\n## Step 15:  The total number of possible sequences of 15 moves is $6^{15}$, as the ant has 6 choices for each move.\n## Step 16:  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{\\binom{15}{9}}{6^{15}}$.\n## Step 17:  We can calculate this to get the final probability.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{32768}}$"
