    "problem": "We roll a fair 6-sided die 5 times.  What is the probability that exactly 3 of the 5 rolls are either a 1 or a 2?",
    "solution": "The number of possible rolls of 5 dice is $6^5$, since there are 6 possibilities for each of the 5 dice.  Now we count the number of ways to get a 1 or a 2 in exactly 3 of the 5 rolls. First, we pick which 3 of the 5 rolls are 1 or 2: we can do that in $\\binom{5}{3}$ ways.  Now for each of these 3 rolls, there are 2 choices, and for each of the other 2 rolls, there are 4 choices.  Thus the probability is \\[\\frac{\\binom{5}{3}2^34^2}{6^5}=\\boxed{\\frac{40}{243}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the probability of rolling a 1 or 2 on a fair 6-sided die.\nThe probability of rolling a 1 or 2 on a fair 6-sided die is 2/6, because there are 2 favorable outcomes (rolling a 1 or 2) out of 6 possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of exactly 3 out of 5 rolls being a 1 or 2.\nTo find this probability, we can use the binomial probability formula. The probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials, each with a probability p of success, is given by the formula: P(X=k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * ((1-p)^(n-k)), where nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of combinations for getting exactly 3 successes in 5 trials.\nThe number of combinations of 5 items taken 3 at a time is given by 5C3, which is equal to 10.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of getting exactly 3 successes in 5 trials.\nUsing the binomial probability formula, we can calculate the probability as follows: P(X=3) = (5C3) * ((2/6)^3) * ((4/6)^2).\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression to find the final probability.\nFirst, simplify the fraction 2/6 to 1/3. Then, calculate (1/3)^3 = 1/27 and (4/6)^2 = 16/36 = 4/9. Now, multiply these values together: P(X=3) = 10 * (1/27) * (4/9).\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final probability.\nMultiply the fractions together: P(X=3) = 10 * (1/27) * (4/9) = 40/243.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction to its lowest terms.\nThe fraction 40/243 is already in its lowest terms.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{40}{243}}$"
