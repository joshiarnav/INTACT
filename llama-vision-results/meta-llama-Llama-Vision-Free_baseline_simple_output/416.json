    "problem": "Mary has $6$ identical basil plants, and three different window sills she can put them on. How many ways are there for Mary to put the plants on the window sills?",
    "solution": "Since the plants are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of plants on each window sill.\n\nIf all the plants are on one window  sill, there are $3$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.\n\nIf $5$ plants are on one window sill and the last is on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants go on which window sill.\n\nIf $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.\n\nIf $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are each on one of the other windows, there are $3$ ways to choose which window the $4$ plants are on.\n\nIf $3$ plants are on one window and the other $3$ plants are all on another window, there are $3$ ways to choose which window has no plants.\n\nIf $3$ plants are on one window, $2$ plants on another window, and $1$ plant on the last window, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants are on which windows.\n\nIf $2$ plants are on each window, there is only one way to arrange them.\n\nIn total, there are $3+6+6+3+3+6+1=\\boxed{28}$ ways to arrange the plants on the window sills.\n\nSee if you can find a faster way to do this problem by considering lining up the plants, and placing two dividers among the plants to separate them into three groups corresponding to the sills.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the number of ways Mary can arrange her 6 identical basil plants on 3 different window sills.\n## Step 2:  We can approach this by considering the distribution of the plants into the sills, which can be thought of as a stars-and-bars problem.\n## Step 3:  In this context, the stars represent the basil plants and the bars represent the divisions between the different sills.\n## Step 4:  To find the number of ways the plants can be arranged, we need to consider how many ways we can arrange 6 stars and 2 bars (since there are 3 sills and we need 2 divisions between them).\n## Step 5:  This is a combinatorial problem, and we can solve it using the formula for combinations, which is given by $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$.\n## Step 6:  In this case, we have 8 objects in total (6 stars and 2 bars), so we want to find the number of combinations of 8 objects taken 2 at a time.\n## Step 7:  Substituting these values into the formula, we get $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8\\cdot 7}{2 \\cdot 1} = 28$.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, there are 28 ways for Mary to arrange her basil plants on the window sills.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28}$"
