    "problem": "An envelope contains eight bills: 2 ones, 2 fives, 2 tens, and 2 twenties. Two bills are drawn at random without replacement. What is the probability that their sum is $\\$20$ or more?",
    "solution": "There are \\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{6!\\cdot 2!} = 28\n\\]ways to choose the bills. A sum of at least $\\$20$ is obtained by choosing  both $\\$20$ bills, one of the  $\\$20$ bills and one of the six smaller bills, or both $\\$10$ bills.   Hence the probability is \\[\n\\frac{ 1 + 2\\cdot 6 + 1}{28}=\\frac{14}{28}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\n\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the probability that the sum of two bills drawn at random without replacement from an envelope containing 2 ones, 2 fives, 2 tens, and 2 twenties is $20 or more.\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of ways to draw two bills from the eight available bills.\n## Step 3:  The total number of ways to choose 2 bills out of 8 is given by the combination formula $\\binom{8}{2}=\\frac{8\\cdot7}{2\\cdot1}=28$.\n## Step 4:  Now, we need to find the number of ways to draw two bills that have a sum of $20 or more.\n## Step 5:  We can break down the possible combinations that lead to a sum of $20 or more:\n## Step 6:  1. Two tens: There are $\\binom{2}{2}=1$ way to choose 2 tens.\n## Step 7:  2. Two twenties: There are $\\binom{2}{2}=1$ way to choose 2 twenties.\n## Step 8:  3. A ten and a twenty: There are $\\binom{2}{1}\\binom{2}{1}=2\\cdot2=4$ ways to choose a ten and a twenty.\n## Step 9:  4. A ten and a twenty and a five and a five: There are $\\binom{2}{1}\\binom{2}{1}\\binom{2}{2}=2\\cdot2\\cdot1=4$ ways to choose a ten and a twenty and a five and a five.\n## Step 10:  5. A ten and two fives: There are $\\binom{2}{1}\\binom{2}{2}=2\\cdot1=2$ ways to choose a ten and two fives.\n## Step 11:  6. A twenty and two fives: There are $\\binom{2}{1}\\binom{2}{2}=2\\cdot1=2$ ways to choose a twenty and two fives.\n## Step 12:  7. A twenty, a ten, and a five: There are $\\binom{2}{1}\\binom{2}{1}\\binom{2}{1}=2\\cdot2\\cdot2=8$ ways to choose a twenty, a ten, and a five.\n## Step 13:  8. Two fives and a twenty: There are $\\binom{2}{2}\\binom{2}{1}=1\\cdot2=2$ ways to choose two fives and a twenty.\n## Step 14:  9. Two fives and two tens: There are $\\binom{2}{2}\\binom{2}{2}=1\\cdot1=1$ way to choose two fives and two tens.\n## Step 15:  After considering all these cases, we find that there are $1+1+4+4+2+2+8+2+1=25$ ways to draw two bills that have a sum of $20 or more.\n## Step 16:  Now, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of successful outcomes (25) by the total number of outcomes (28).\n## Step 17:  Therefore, the probability that the sum of two bills drawn at random without replacement from the envelope is $20 or more is $\\frac{25}{28}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{28}}$"
