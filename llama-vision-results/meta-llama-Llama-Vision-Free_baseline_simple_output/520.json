    "problem": "Carlos has chosen twelve different compact discs (CDs) he would like to buy. Four are rap music, five are country music, and three are heavy metal music. Carlos then randomly selects five of the 12 CDs to purchase. What is the probability that his purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{12}{5}=792$ equally likely choices for the set of 5 CDs Carlos purchases.  Of these, $\\binom{9}{5}$ include no heavy metal CDs, $\\binom{8}{5}$ include no rap CDs, and $\\binom{7}{5}$ include no country CDs.  We can add these numbers to find the number of sets of CDs which do not include at least one CD from each category, except that we have counted the set of 5 country CDs twice, since it omits both heavy metal and rap.  Therefore,  \\[\n\\binom{9}{5}+\\binom{8}{5}+\\binom{7}{5}-1=126+56+21-1=202\n\\] of the sets of 5 CDs do not include at least one CD from each category.  Subtracting from 792, we find that 590 of the sets do include at least one CD from each category.  The probability that a chosen randomly set will be one of these is $\\dfrac{590}{792}=\\boxed{\\frac{295}{396}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to select 5 CDs out of 12.\nTo calculate the probability, we first need to find the total number of ways Carlos can select 5 CDs out of the 12 available. This is represented by the combination formula $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $k$ is the number of items to choose, and $!$ denotes factorial. Here, $n=12$ and $k=5$, so the total number of ways to select 5 CDs out of 12 is $C(12, 5) = \\frac{12!}{5!(12-5)!} = \\frac{12!}{5!7!} = 792$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose at least one CD from each category.\nTo find the number of ways to choose at least one CD from each category, we will first calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 CDs and then subtract the number of ways to choose 5 CDs with zero CDs from each category. We can do this by finding the number of ways to choose 5 CDs with no rap CDs, no country CDs, and no heavy metal CDs, and then subtracting the sum of these from the total. The number of ways to choose 5 CDs with no CDs from a particular category is equivalent to choosing 5 CDs out of the remaining 9 CDs from the other categories. Therefore, the number of ways to choose 5 CDs with no rap CDs is $C(8, 5) = 56$, the number of ways to choose 5 CDs with no country CDs is $C(7, 5) = 21$, and the number of ways to choose 5 CDs with no heavy metal CDs is $C(9, 5) = 126$. However, this approach can lead to double counting some scenarios (e.g., choosing no CDs from country and heavy metal). We can instead directly find the scenarios where we don't get at least one from each category by choosing 5 CDs from only one or two categories. Therefore, we will directly calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 CDs from only one category, two categories, and none of the categories.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 CDs from only one category.\nThe number of ways to choose 5 CDs from only the rap category is $C(4, 5) = 0$, since we cannot choose 5 CDs from only 4. The same is true for the country and heavy metal categories.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 CDs from exactly two categories.\nWe can do this in three ways:\n- Choose 5 CDs from the rap and country categories: $C(4+5, 5) = C(9, 5) = 126$.\n- Choose 5 CDs from the country and heavy metal categories: $C(5+3, 5) = C(8, 5) = 56$.\n- Choose 5 CDs from the rap and heavy metal categories: $C(4+3, 5) = C(7, 5) = 21$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 CDs from none of the categories.\nThis is not possible, as Carlos must choose at least one CD from one of the categories.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 CDs with zero CDs from each category.\nTo calculate this, we find the sum of the number of ways to choose 5 CDs from only one category and the number of ways to choose 5 CDs from exactly two categories. The number of ways to choose 5 CDs from only one category is 0. The number of ways to choose 5 CDs from exactly two categories is $126 + 56 + 21 = 203$. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose 5 CDs with zero CDs from each category is 0 + 203 = 203.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability that his purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories.\nThe probability is the number of ways to choose 5 CDs with at least one CD from each category divided by the total number of ways to choose 5 CDs. Since we know that the total number of ways to choose 5 CDs is 792 and the number of ways to choose 5 CDs with zero CDs from each category is 203, we can calculate the probability. However, since calculating the number of ways to choose 5 CDs with at least one CD from each category directly is difficult, we will instead calculate 1 - (the probability of not choosing at least one CD from each category). The probability of not choosing at least one CD from each category is the number of ways to choose 5 CDs with zero CDs from each category divided by the total number of ways to choose 5 CDs. This is $\\frac{203}{792}$. So, the probability of choosing at least one CD from each category is $1 - \\frac{203}{792}$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the final probability.\nThe final probability is $1 - \\frac{203}{792} = \\frac{792 - 203}{792} = \\frac{589}{792}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{589}{792}}$"
