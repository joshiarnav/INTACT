    "problem": "Ali, Bonnie, Carlo and Dianna are going to drive together to a nearby theme park.  The car they are using has four seats: one driver's seat, one front passenger seat and two different back seats. Bonnie and Carlo are the only two who can drive the car. How many possible seating arrangements are there?",
    "solution": "There are 2 choices for the driver.  The other three can seat themselves in $3\\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$ different ways. So the number of seating arrangements is $2 \\times 6 =\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the constraints for the driver's seat.\nThere are only two people who can drive the car, Bonnie and Carlo. Therefore, there are 2 options for the driver's seat.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of options for the front passenger seat.\nOnce the driver is chosen, there are 3 people left to choose from for the front passenger seat.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of options for the back seats.\nAfter the driver and front passenger are chosen, there are 2 people left. They can occupy the two back seats in 2 different orders since the seats are distinct. Therefore, there are 2 options for the arrangement of the back seats.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the rule of product to find the total number of seating arrangements.\nThe total number of arrangements is found by multiplying the number of options for each seat. Therefore, the total number of possible seating arrangements is 2 * 3 * 2 = 12.\n\n## Step 5: Provide the final answer.\nBased on the calculations in the previous steps, we have the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
