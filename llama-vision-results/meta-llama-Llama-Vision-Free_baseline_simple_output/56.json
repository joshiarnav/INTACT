    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $11!$. Then since the I's, S's and the P's are not unique, we divide by $4!$, $4!$, and $2!$ for the arrangements of I's, S's, and P's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{11!}{4! \\times 4! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{34,\\!650}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to recognize that we're dealing with permutations of items that are not all unique. Specifically, the word MISSISSIPPI has repeated letters, which complicates the calculation.\n## Step 2:  If all letters in the word were unique, the number of arrangements would simply be the factorial of the number of letters. However, since there are repeated letters (4 S's, 4 I's, and 2 P's), we have to adjust for these repetitions to avoid overcounting.\n## Step 3:  The formula for permutations of a set of objects where certain objects are indistinguishable involves dividing the total number of permutations (n!) by the product of the factorials of the number of repetitions for each type of indistinguishable object.\n## Step 4:  In this case, we have n = 11 letters in total (since MISSISSIPPI has 11 letters).\n## Step 5:  There are 4 S's, so we divide by 4! (since arrangements of S's don't produce different outcomes).\n## Step 6:  There are 4 I's, so we also divide by 4! (as the arrangement of I's doesn't generate distinct arrangements).\n## Step 7:  There are 2 P's, so we divide by 2! (since the arrangement of P's doesn't result in distinct outcomes).\n## Step 8:  The formula looks like this: 11! / (4! * 4! * 2!).\n## Step 9:  Now, we calculate this. 11! = 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 39,916,800.\n## Step 10:  4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n## Step 11:  We need to do 4! twice, so that's 24 * 24 = 576.\n## Step 12:  2! = 2 * 1 = 2.\n## Step 13:  Now, putting it all together: 39,916,800 / (576 * 2) = 39,916,800 / 1152.\n## Step 14:  39,916,800 / 1152 = 34,650.\n## Step 15:  Therefore, there are 34,650 ways to arrange the letters of the word MISSISSIPPI.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{34650}$"
