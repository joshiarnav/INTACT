    "problem": "A committee is to be made up from a group of 10 candidates. The committee must consist of a chairman and some (not necessarily nonzero) number of members-at-large. How many ways can the committee be chosen? (For example, suppose that Alex is chair while Betty, Carl, and D'Angelo make up the committee. This counts as the same as Alex being chair while Carl, Betty, and D'Angelo make up the committee. It is not the same as Betty being the chair, with Alex, Carl, and D'Angelo making up the committee. It is also not the same as Alex being chair with the committee consisting of Betty and Carl.)",
    "solution": "There are 10 ways to choose the chairman.  After choosing the chairman, we must form the rest of the committee.  For each of the other 9 candidates, we have 2 choices: either the candidate is on the committee or not.  So, the total number of ways we can form a committee with a given chairman is $2^9$.  Therefore, there are $10\\cdot 2^9 =\\boxed{5120}$ ways to form the committee.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem requires us to find the number of ways to choose a committee from a group of 10 candidates. The committee must consist of a chairman and some (not necessarily nonzero) number of members-at-large.\n## Step 2:  We have 10 choices for the chairperson, as any of the 10 candidates can be the chairman.\n## Step 3:  Once the chairman is chosen, we need to determine the number of ways the remaining members-at-large can be chosen from the remaining 9 candidates.\n## Step 4:  Since the order in which the members-at-large are chosen does not matter, we can use the concept of combinations to calculate this.\n## Step 5:  The number of ways to choose the members-at-large from the remaining 9 candidates is given by $2^9$, as each of the 9 candidates can either be included or not included in the committee.\n## Step 6:  To find the total number of ways the committee can be chosen, we multiply the number of choices for the chairman by the number of ways the members-at-large can be chosen.\n## Step 7:  This gives us a total of $10 \\times 2^9 = 10 \\times 512 = \\boxed{5120}$ ways to choose the committee.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5120}$"
