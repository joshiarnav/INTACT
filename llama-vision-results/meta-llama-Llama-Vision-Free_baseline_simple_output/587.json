    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word GAMMAS.\n## Step 2:  The word GAMMAS has 6 letters, but it has repeated letters. There are 2 A's, 2 M's, and the rest are distinct.\n## Step 3:  When we are arranging the letters of the word, we first choose where to place the two A's.\n## Step 4:  This is a combination problem, because the order in which we place the A's does not matter.\n## Step 5:  There are $\\binom{6}{2}$ ways to choose where to place the two A's. $\\binom{n}{k}$ denotes the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n distinct elements.\n## Step 6:  After placing the two A's, we are left with 4 letters: G, M, M, and S.\n## Step 7:  The two M's are indistinguishable, so we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange these two M's among themselves, which is 2!.\n## Step 8:  So, the total number of ways to arrange the letters of the word GAMMAS is $\\frac{\\binom{6}{2} \\times 4!}{2!}$.\n## Step 9:  Simplifying this, we get $\\frac{15 \\times 24}{2}$.\n## Step 10:  This equals $15 \\times 12$, which equals $\\boxed{180}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{180}$"
