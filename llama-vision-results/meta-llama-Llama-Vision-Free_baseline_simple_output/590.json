    "problem": "If $a,$ $b$ and $c$ are three (not necessarily different) numbers chosen randomly and with replacement from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\},$ what is the probability that $ab+c$ is even?",
    "solution": "The quantity $ab+c$ is even if and only if $ab$ and $c$ are both odd or both even. The probability that $c$ is odd is $\\frac{3}{5},$ and the probability that $ab$ is odd is $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{25}$ (because both $a$ and $b$ must be odd). Therefore, the probability that $ab+c$ is even is \\[\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} + \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{9}{25}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{59}{125}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem involves randomly choosing three numbers, $a,$ $b,$ and $c,$ with replacement from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}.$ We need to find the probability that the expression $ab+c$ is even.\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we need to consider the properties of even and odd numbers. An even number is any number that is divisible by 2, while an odd number is not divisible by 2.\n## Step 3:  The expression $ab+c$ will be even if at least one of $a$ or $b$ is even, because the product of two integers is even if at least one of the integers is even.\n## Step 4:  If $a$ is even, then $ab$ will be even regardless of the value of $b.$ In this case, adding an odd $c$ to an even $ab$ will result in an odd number. Similarly, if $a$ is odd, then $ab$ will be odd. For $ab+c$ to be even, $c$ must also be even in this case.\n## Step 5:  Since there are 5 numbers in the set, the probability that $a$ is even is $\\frac{2}{5},$ and the probability that $a$ is odd is $\\frac{3}{5}.$\n## Step 6:  If $a$ is odd, then $ab$ will be odd, and for $ab+c$ to be even, $c$ must be even. The probability that $c$ is even is $\\frac{2}{5}.$\n## Step 7:  It's also possible that both $a$ and $b$ are odd, in which case $ab$ is odd. For $ab+c$ to be even, $c$ must be even in this case, with a probability of $\\frac{2}{5}.$\n## Step 8:  Now, we can calculate the probabilities of the different scenarios:\n## Step 9:  Probability that $a$ is even and $b$ is even and $c$ is even: $\\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{8}{125}$\n## Step 10:  Probability that $a$ is odd and $b$ is even and $c$ is even: $\\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{12}{125}$\n## Step 11:  Probability that $a$ is even and $b$ is odd and $c$ is even: $\\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{12}{125}$\n## Step 12:  To find the overall probability that $ab+c$ is even, we sum up the probabilities of all these cases: $\\frac{8}{125} + \\frac{12}{125} + \\frac{12}{125} = \\frac{32}{125}$\n## Step 13:  Therefore, the probability that $ab+c$ is even is $\\frac{32}{125}.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{32}{125}}$"
