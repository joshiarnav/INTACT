    "problem": "A palindrome is a number which reads the same forward as backward. How many five-digit palindromes can be made from the digits 1, 2, and 9?  (Each digit may be used more than once.)",
    "solution": "A five-digit palindrome would be of the form $ABCBA$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are digits (not necessarily distinct) from $0$ to $9$ (with $A$ from $1$ to $9$). We have three possibilities for each of $A$, $B$ and $C,$ which gives us $3^3 = \\boxed{27}$ possible palindromes.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, let's understand the structure of a five-digit palindrome since we are looking for palindromes made from the digits 1, 2, and 9.\n## Step 2:  A five-digit palindrome has the form $abcba$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the digits.\n## Step 3:  We are given that each digit can be used more than once, so we have to consider the repetition of digits when constructing the palindromes.\n## Step 4:  Now, let's calculate the number of five-digit palindromes that can be formed using the digits 1, 2, and 9.\n## Step 5:  We start with the first digit, $a$. Since we are choosing from the digits 1, 2, and 9, there are 3 choices for the first digit.\n## Step 6:  Moving on to the second digit, $b$, we also have 3 choices from the digits 1, 2, and 9.\n## Step 7:  Similarly, for the third digit, $c$, there are again 3 choices from the digits 1, 2, and 9.\n## Step 8:  Once the first three digits are chosen, the last two digits are fixed as $ba$ to maintain the palindrome property.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the total number of five-digit palindromes can be calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each digit, which gives us $3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 3^3$.\n## Step 10:  Hence, we can find the total number of five-digit palindromes by evaluating $3^3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$"
