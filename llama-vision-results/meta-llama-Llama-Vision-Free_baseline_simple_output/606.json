    "problem": "Three cards are dealt at random from a standard deck (13 clubs, 13 diamonds, 13 hearts, and 13 spades) of 52 cards.  What is the probability that all three cards are $\\heartsuit$s?",
    "solution": "The probability is $\\dfrac{13}{52} \\times \\dfrac{12}{51} \\times \\dfrac{11}{50} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{850}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from a deck of 52.\nTo calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from a deck of 52, we use the combination formula, which is $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items and $k$ is the number of items to choose. So, the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from 52 is $C(52, 3) = \\frac{52!}{3!(52-3)!}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 hearts from the 13 hearts in the deck.\nWe need to determine the number of ways to choose 3 hearts from the 13 hearts in the deck. Using the combination formula again, the number of ways to choose 3 hearts from 13 is $C(13, 3) = \\frac{13!}{3!(13-3)!}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability that all three cards are hearts.\nThe probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability that all three cards are hearts is the number of ways to choose 3 hearts divided by the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from the deck, which is $\\frac{C(13, 3)}{C(52, 3)}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression $\\frac{C(13, 3)}{C(52, 3)}$ to get the probability.\nCalculate the values of $C(13, 3)$ and $C(52, 3)$ and simplify the fraction to obtain the final probability.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $C(13, 3)$.\nUsing the combination formula, $C(13, 3) = \\frac{13!}{3!(13-3)!} = \\frac{13*12*11}{3*2*1} = 286$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $C(52, 3)$.\nUsing the combination formula, $C(52, 3) = \\frac{52!}{3!(52-3)!} = \\frac{52*51*50}{3*2*1} = 22100$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction $\\frac{C(13, 3)}{C(52, 3)}$.\n$\\frac{C(13, 3)}{C(52, 3)} = \\frac{286}{22100} = \\frac{11*26}{850} = \\frac{11}{850*2} = \\frac{11}{1700}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{850*2}=\\frac{11}{1700}}$"
