    "problem": "If two numbers are randomly chosen without replacement from $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, what is the probability their sum is greater than their product? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers.  Observe that $ab-(a+b)=(a-1)(b-1)-1$.  This quantity is non-negative unless either $a$ or $b$ equals 1.  Therefore, the only pairs of positive integers for which the sum exceeds the product are those of the form $\\{1,n\\}$ where $n$ is a positive integer.  In this case, there are 4 such pairs: $\\{1,2\\}$, $\\{1,3\\}$, $\\{1,4\\}$, and $\\{1,5\\}$.  There are a total of $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ pairs of integers, so the probability that the sum exceeds the product is $\\frac{4}{10}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: List all the possible pairs of numbers that can be chosen without replacement from the given set.\nThe possible pairs are (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5).\n\n## Step 2: Determine the total number of pairs.\nThere are 10 possible pairs in total.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the pairs where the sum is greater than the product.\nFor each pair, we need to check if the sum is greater than the product:\n- (1, 2): sum = 3, product = 2, sum > product\n- (1, 3): sum = 4, product = 3, sum > product\n- (1, 4): sum = 5, product = 4, sum > product\n- (1, 5): sum = 6, product = 5, sum > product\n- (2, 3): sum = 5, product = 6, sum < product\n- (2, 4): sum = 6, product = 8, sum < product\n- (2, 5): sum = 7, product = 10, sum < product\n- (3, 4): sum = 7, product = 12, sum < product\n- (3, 5): sum = 8, product = 15, sum < product\n- (4, 5): sum = 9, product = 20, sum < product\n\n## Step 4: Count the number of pairs where the sum is greater than the product.\nFrom step 3, we can see that only 4 pairs meet this condition.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that the sum is greater than the product.\nThe probability is equal to the number of pairs where the sum is greater than the product divided by the total number of pairs. So, the probability is 4/10, which can be simplified.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the fraction.\nThe fraction 4/10 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. Simplifying gives us 2/5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$"
