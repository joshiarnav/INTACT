    "problem": "There are 8 pens along a wall in the pound.  The pound has to allocate 4 pens to dogs, 3 to cats, and one to roosters.  In how many ways can the pound make the allocation?",
    "solution": "There are $8!$ ways to arrange 8 allocations to the pens if they are not identical, but we must divide by $4!$ for the four dog pen allocations and divide by $3!$ for the three cat pen allocations.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{8!}{4! \\times 3!} = \\boxed{280}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 4 pens out of 8 for dogs\nTo calculate the number of ways to choose 4 pens out of 8 for dogs, we use the combination formula, which is given by n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. So, for dogs, the number of ways is 8! / (4!(8-4)!) = 70.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 pens out of the remaining 4 for cats\nAfter allocating pens to dogs, there are 4 pens left. We can choose 3 pens out of 4 for cats. Using the combination formula, the number of ways to choose 3 pens out of 4 for cats is 4! / (3!(4-3)!) = 4.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 1 pen out of the remaining 1 for roosters\nAfter allocating pens to dogs and cats, there is only 1 pen left, which is to be allocated to roosters. There is only one way to choose 1 pen out of 1 for roosters.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways by multiplying the number of ways for each step\nThe total number of ways to make the allocation is the product of the number of ways for each step, which is 70 * 4 * 1 = 280.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{280}$"
