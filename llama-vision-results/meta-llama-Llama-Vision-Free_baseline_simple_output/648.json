    "problem": "A bag contains 12 red marbles and 6 blue marbles. Two marbles are selected at random and without replacement. What is the probability that one marble is red and one is blue? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "If a red marble is chosen first ($\\frac{12}{18}=\\frac{2}{3}$ chance), then there is a $\\frac{6}{17}$ chance that a blue marble will be chosen second. If a blue marble is chosen first ($\\frac{6}{18}=\\frac{1}{3}$ chance), then there is a $\\frac{12}{17}$ chance that a red marble will be chosen second. The total probability that one red and one blue marble will be chosen is $\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{6}{17}+\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{12}{17}=\\boxed{\\frac{8}{17}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of marbles in the bag\nThe bag contains 12 red marbles and 6 blue marbles, making a total of 12 + 6 = 18 marbles.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of ways to select 2 marbles out of 18 without replacement\nThe total number of ways to select 2 marbles out of 18 is calculated using the combination formula, C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of marbles and k is the number of marbles selected. So, C(18, 2) = 18! / [2!(18-2)!] = 18 * 17 / 2 = 153.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to select 1 red marble and 1 blue marble\nTo select 1 red marble out of 12 and 1 blue marble out of 6, we use the combination formula for each color and then multiply those numbers together. For red, C(12, 1) = 12, and for blue, C(6, 1) = 6. So, the total number of ways to select 1 of each color is 12 * 6 = 72.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of selecting 1 red marble and 1 blue marble\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes (selecting 1 red and 1 blue marble) divided by the total number of outcomes (selecting any 2 marbles). So, the probability = 72 / 153.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the probability fraction\nTo simplify the fraction 72/153, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 72 and 153. The GCD of 72 and 153 is 9. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD to simplify the fraction. Simplified probability = (72 / 9) / (153 / 9) = 8 / 17.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{17}}$"
