    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the number of paths from point $C$ to point $B$, we need to consider the steps involved.\n## Step 2:  Each step must be either up or to the right, and we need to calculate the total number of paths that can be formed using these steps.\n## Step 3:  We can visualize this as a grid, where the starting point $C$ is at the coordinates (1,2) and the endpoint $B$ is at the coordinates (5,4).\n## Step 4:  To reach $B$ from $C$, we must take 3 steps up and 4 steps to the right.\n## Step 5:  The order of these steps matters, as the path taken will determine the total number of paths from $C$ to $B$.\n## Step 6:  We can think of this as arranging the steps in a sequence, where the 3 steps up are denoted as \"U\" and the 4 steps to the right are denoted as \"R\".\n## Step 7:  This can be represented as a string of length 7, where 3 of the characters are \"U\" and the other 4 characters are \"R\".\n## Step 8:  The number of ways to arrange these characters can be calculated using combinations, specifically, the formula for combinations of n items taken k at a time: $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.\n## Step 9:  In this case, we want to choose 3 positions out of 7 for the \"U\"s (and the remaining 4 positions will be \"R\"s). This can be calculated as $\\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1}$.\n## Step 10:  Evaluating the expression, we get $\\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35$.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, there are 35 different paths from $C$ to $B$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{35}$"
