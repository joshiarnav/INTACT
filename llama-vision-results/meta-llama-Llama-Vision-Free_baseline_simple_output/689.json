    "solution": "The distances between corners of a unit cube are 1, $\\sqrt{2}$, and $\\sqrt{3}$. If the two shortest sides are 1 and 1, the third side has to be $\\sqrt{2}$. If the two shortest sides are 1 and $\\sqrt{2}$, the third side must be $\\sqrt{3}$. If the two shortest sides are $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{2}$, the third side must also be $\\sqrt{2}$. There is no case where the shortest side is $\\sqrt{3}$. This gives $\\boxed{3}$ non-congruent triangles.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are tasked with finding the number of non-congruent triangles that can be formed using the corners of a unit cube.\n\n## Step 2: Define non-congruent triangles\nNon-congruent triangles are triangles that cannot be transformed into each other through rotation or reflection. In this context, we are looking for distinct triangles that have different sets of vertices.\n\n## Step 3: Count the number of vertices\nA unit cube has 8 corners (vertices).\n\n## Step 4: Determine the number of ways to choose 3 vertices\nTo form a triangle, we need to choose 3 vertices out of the 8 available. This is a combination problem, and can be calculated as C(8,3).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate C(8,3)\nThe formula for C(n,r) is n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial. C(8,3) = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!) = 8! / (3! * 5!) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 56.\n\n## Step 6: Identify congruent triangles\nWe need to eliminate any duplicate triangles that are congruent. These triangles are those that can be obtained by rotating or reflecting other triangles.\n\n## Step 7: Count the congruent triangles\nThere are 8 triangles with 3 adjacent vertices on the same face, 12 triangles formed by choosing two opposite vertices and the vertex that is the midpoint of the opposite face, 6 triangles that are formed by the vertices of the edges of the cube, and 8 triangles that are formed by the vertices of the diagonals of the cube.\n\n## Step 8: Eliminate duplicates\nWe have to subtract the duplicates to get the final count of non-congruent triangles.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the final count of non-congruent triangles\nThe final count of non-congruent triangles is the total count of possible triangles minus the duplicate triangles. This is 56 - 8 - 12 - 6 - 8.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the final count\nThe final count is 56 - 34 = 22.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{22}$"
