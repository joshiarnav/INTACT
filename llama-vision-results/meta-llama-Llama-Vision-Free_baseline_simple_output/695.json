    "problem": "Maria has three identical apples and three identical oranges. How many ways are there for her to distribute the fruits among her four friends if she doesn't give Jacky any oranges?  (Note: Maria takes none of the fruit herself, and some of her friends might not receive any fruit at all.)",
    "solution": "First, just consider the apples. Imagine putting three dividers among the apples, so that Maria's first friend gets the apples to the left of the first divider, Maria's second friend gets the apples between the first and second dividers, Maria's third friend gets the apples between the second and third dividers, and Maria's last friend gets the apples after the third divider. With three dividers and three apples, there are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to arrange the dividers. Now, consider the oranges. Since Maria won't give Jacky any oranges, Maria has to distribute the oranges among her other three friends. With three oranges and two dividers, there are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways for Maria to distribute the oranges. The total number of ways for Maria to distribute the fruit is $20\\cdot 10=\\boxed{200}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to distribute the apples\nSince the apples are identical, we need to consider the number of ways to distribute three identical apples among four friends. This is equivalent to placing three identical balls into four distinct boxes. We can use the \"stars and bars\" method to count the number of ways, which is given by $\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$, where n is the number of balls and k is the number of boxes. In this case, n = 3 and k = 4, so the number of ways to distribute the apples is $\\binom{3+4-1}{4-1}=\\binom{6}{3}=20$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of ways to distribute the oranges\nSince Jacky can't receive any oranges, we need to distribute three identical oranges among three friends (excluding Jacky). This is also equivalent to placing three identical balls into three distinct boxes. Using the \"stars and bars\" method, we get $\\binom{3+3-1}{3-1}=\\binom{5}{2}=10$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of ways to distribute the fruits\nTo find the total number of ways to distribute the fruits, we multiply the number of ways to distribute the apples and the number of ways to distribute the oranges. This gives us $20 \\cdot 10 = 200$.\n\n## Step 4: Verify the result\nWe should verify that the result is reasonable by considering the possible cases. However, since the calculation is straightforward, we can proceed with the answer obtained from the previous steps.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{200}$"
