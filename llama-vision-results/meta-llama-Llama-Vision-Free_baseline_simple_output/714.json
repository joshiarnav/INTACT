    "problem": "The letters of the word `SIXTEEN' are randomly arranged.  What is the probability that the two E's are not next to each other?",
    "solution": "The best way to do this is to find the probability that the two E's are next to each other.  There are $\\dfrac{7!}{2}$ arrangements of the word SIXTEEN.  If we want to find the number of arrangements such that the E's are next to each other, we find the number of arrangements of the six-letter word SIXT(EE)N (where we treat the two E's as a block), which is $6!$.  So the probability that an arrangement of the word SIXTEEN has the two E's next to each other is $\\dfrac{6!}{\\frac{7!}{2}} = \\dfrac{2}{7}$.  So the probability that the two E's aren't next to each other is $1 - \\dfrac{2}{7} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{7}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible arrangements of the letters in the word 'SIXTEEN'.\nWe start by calculating the total number of ways to arrange all 7 letters without any restrictions. This is a permutation problem where order matters, so we use the formula for permutations of n objects, which is n!. In this case, n = 7, so there are 7! = 5040 possible arrangements.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of arrangements where the two E's are next to each other.\nTo find the number of arrangements where the two E's are next to each other, we can treat the two E's as one single unit. This effectively reduces our total units (letters or pairs of letters) to arrange from 7 to 6. The formula for permutations of n objects is n!, so for 6 units, we have 6! = 720 possible arrangements where the two E's are adjacent.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of arrangements where the two E's are not next to each other.\nWe can find this by subtracting the number of arrangements where the two E's are next to each other from the total number of arrangements. So, 5040 - 720 = 4320 arrangements where the two E's are not next to each other.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that the two E's are not next to each other.\nTo find the probability, divide the number of favorable outcomes (where the two E's are not next to each other) by the total number of outcomes. So, the probability is 4320 / 5040.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the fraction to get the final probability.\nTo simplify the fraction 4320 / 5040, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4320 and 5040 to divide both numerator and denominator by it. The GCD of 4320 and 5040 is 1440. So, (4320 / 1440) / (5040 / 1440) = 3 / 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$"
