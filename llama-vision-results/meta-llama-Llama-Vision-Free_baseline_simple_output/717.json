    "problem": "Given that $a$ and $b$ are real numbers such that $-3\\leq a\\leq1$ and $-2\\leq b\\leq 4$, and values for $a$ and $b$ are chosen at random, what is the probability that the product $a\\cdot b$ is positive?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that both $a$ and $b$ are positive is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{6}$. The probability that $a$ and $b$ are both negative is $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{4}$.  Since $ab$ is positive if and only if one of these two events occur, the probability that $ab$ is positive is $\\dfrac{1}{6}+\\dfrac{1}{4}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{12}}$.  Graphically, we can picture the possible outcomes for $(a,b)$ as a rectangle in a Cartesian plane.  The shaded rectangles are the regions in which $ab>0$.

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the probability that the product $a \\cdot b$ is positive, we first need to understand what makes the product positive.\nThe product $a \\cdot b$ is positive if both $a$ and $b$ are either both positive or both negative.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the combinations of signs for $a$ and $b$ that result in a positive product.\nThere are four combinations: (1) $a$ is positive and $b$ is positive, (2) $a$ is negative and $b$ is negative, (3) $a$ is positive and $b$ is negative, and (4) $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive. However, only (1) and (2) result in a positive product.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of the product being positive for each combination.\nThe probability of $a$ being positive and $b$ being positive is $\\frac{1-(-3)}{3+1} \\times \\frac{4-(-2)}{4+2} = \\frac{4}{4} \\times \\frac{6}{6} = \\frac{1}{1} \\times \\frac{1}{1} = 1$. The probability of $a$ being negative and $b$ being negative is $\\frac{-1-(-3)}{3+1} \\times \\frac{-2-(-2)}{4+2} = \\frac{2}{4} \\times \\frac{0}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0 = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Since the only two combinations that result in a positive product are (1) and (2), we can add their probabilities together to find the total probability of the product being positive.\nThe total probability is $1 + 0 = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: However, we need to consider all four quadrants of the coordinate plane where $a$ and $b$ can lie to calculate the probability.\nThis means we must subtract the areas where $a \\cdot b$ is negative, which are the 3rd and 4th quadrants.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of $a$ and $b$ lying in the 3rd and 4th quadrants, where the product is negative.\nThe area of the 3rd quadrant is $\\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{6}{16}$ and the area of the 4th quadrant is $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{6}{16}$.\n\n## Step 7: Add the areas of the 3rd and 4th quadrants together to find the total area where $a \\cdot b$ is negative.\nThe total area is $\\frac{6}{16} + \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{12}{16} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\n## Step 8: To find the probability of $a \\cdot b$ being positive, we must subtract the probability of it being negative from 1.\nSo, the probability of $a \\cdot b$ being positive is $1 - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 9: Therefore, the probability that the product $a\\cdot b$ is positive is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$"
