    "problem": "A $4\\times 4\\times 4$ open cubical box contains 64 identical small cubes that exactly fill the box. How many of these small cubes touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box?",
    "solution": "We count the complement. A cube that does not touch the bottom or a lateral side either touches only the top side or no sides at all. These cubes form a $2\\times2\\times3$ prism, giving 12 cubes. These 12 cubes are subtracted from 64 to leave $\\boxed{52}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, we need to analyze the structure of the $4\\times 4\\times 4$ open cubical box and understand the arrangement of the small cubes within it.\n## Step 2:  The box is composed of 64 identical small cubes that exactly fill the box. We are tasked with finding out how many of these small cubes touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box.\n## Step 3:  Let's consider the bottom layer of the box. It consists of 16 small cubes, arranged in a $4\\times 4$ grid. Therefore, all of these cubes touch the bottom of the box.\n## Step 4:  Moving on to the lateral sides, we observe that each of the four sides of the box has 16 cubes. However, the cubes at the bottom and top of each side do not touch the lateral sides of the box.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, for each side, 8 cubes touch the lateral sides of the box. This accounts for a total of 32 cubes touching the lateral sides of the box.\n## Step 6:  To find the total number of cubes that touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box, we add the number of cubes that touch the bottom and the number of cubes that touch the lateral sides.\n## Step 7:  Hence, the total number of cubes that touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box is $16 + 32 = \\boxed{48}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{48}$"
