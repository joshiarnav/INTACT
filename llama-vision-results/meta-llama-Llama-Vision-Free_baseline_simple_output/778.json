    "solution": "A cube has four red faces if it is attached to exactly two other cubes.  The four top cubes are each attached to only one other cube,  so they have five red faces.  The four bottom corner cubes are each attached to three others, so they have three red faces.  The remaining $\\boxed{6}$ each have four red faces.",
