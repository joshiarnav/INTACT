    "problem": "If $1 \\le a \\le 10$ and $1 \\le b \\le 36$, for how many ordered pairs of integers $(a, b)$ is $\\sqrt{a + \\sqrt{b}}$ an integer?",
    "solution": "If $\\sqrt{a+\\sqrt{b}}$ is an integer, then its square $a+\\sqrt{b}$ is also an integer.  Therefore, $\\sqrt{b}$ is an integer.  In other words, $b$ must be a perfect square.  If we define $c=\\sqrt{b}$, then the problem has asked us to find the number of ordered pairs $(a,c)$ for which $1\\leq a \\leq 10$, $1\\leq c\\leq 6$, and $a+c$ is a perfect square.  We check the 6 possibilities for $c$ separately.  If $c=1$, then $a$ is 3 or 8.  If $c=2$, then $a$ is 2 or 7.  If $c=3$, then $a$ is 1 or 6.  If $c=4$, then $a=5$, and if $c=5$, then $a=4$.  Finally, if $c=6$, then $a$ is either 10 or 3.  Altogether, there are $2+2+2+1+1+2=\\boxed{10}$ ordered pairs $(a,c)$ satisfying the given conditions.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the constraints for $a$ and $b$.\nGiven that $1 \\le a \\le 10$ and $1 \\le b \\le 36$, we need to find how many ordered pairs of integers $(a, b)$ make $\\sqrt{a + \\sqrt{b}}$ an integer.\n\n## Step 2: Express $\\sqrt{a + \\sqrt{b}}$ as an integer.\nFor $\\sqrt{a + \\sqrt{b}}$ to be an integer, $a + \\sqrt{b}$ must be a perfect square.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the perfect squares that are possible for $a + \\sqrt{b}$.\nSince $1 \\le a \\le 10$, the minimum value of $a + \\sqrt{b}$ is $1 + \\sqrt{1} = 2$ and the maximum value is $10 + \\sqrt{36} = 10 + 6 = 16$. Thus, we need to consider perfect squares in the range from 2 to 16.\n\n## Step 4: List the perfect squares in the range from 2 to 16.\nThe perfect squares in this range are $4, 9, 16$.\n\n## Step 5: Break down the problem into sub-problems for each perfect square.\nTo find how many ordered pairs satisfy the condition, we need to consider each perfect square $k^2$ from our list ($4, 9, 16$) and find how many $a$ values make $a + \\sqrt{b}$ equal to $k^2$, given the constraints on $a$ and $b$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $a$ and $b$ when $k^2 = 4$.\nFor $k^2 = 4$, we need to find integer solutions for $a + \\sqrt{b} = 4$ considering our constraints on $a$ and $b$. This means $a$ could be $1, 2, 3$ since $a \\le 10$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $a$ and $b$ when $k^2 = 9$.\nFor $k^2 = 9$, we need to find integer solutions for $a + \\sqrt{b} = 9$. Considering the constraints, $a$ could be $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$ since $a \\le 10$. We need to check which of these values for $a$ can result in an integer value for $\\sqrt{b}$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $a$ and $b$ when $k^2 = 16$.\nFor $k^2 = 16$, we need to find integer solutions for $a + \\sqrt{b} = 16$. Given the constraints, $a$ could be $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10$ since $a \\le 10$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the number of possible values for $b$ for each $k^2$.\nWhen $k^2 = 4$, we can have $a = 1, 2, 3$. For $a = 1$, $b$ can be $1$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 2$, $b$ can be $0$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 3$, $b$ can be $-5$, which is not a valid solution since $b$ must be greater than $1$, so there are $0$ possible pairs for $a = 3$.\n\nWhen $k^2 = 9$, for $a = 1$, $b$ can be $8$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 2$, $b$ can be $7$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 3$, $b$ can be $6$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 4$, $b$ can be $5$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 5$, $b$ can be $4$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 6$, $b$ can be $3$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 7$, $b$ can be $2$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 8$, $b$ can be $1$, so there's $1$ possible pair. However, we need to check if these $b$ values can produce integers for $\\sqrt{b}$. Since $b$ can be an integer in the range $[1, 36]$, we find that all values calculated for $b$ are within the valid range.\n\nWhen $k^2 = 16$, for $a = 1$, $b$ can be $15$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 2$, $b$ can be $14$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 3$, $b$ can be $13$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 4$, $b$ can be $12$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 5$, $b$ can be $11$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 6$, $b$ can be $10$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 7$, $b$ can be $9$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 8$, $b$ can be $8$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 9$, $b$ can be $7$, so there's $1$ possible pair. For $a = 10$, $b$ can be $6$, so there's $1$ possible pair.\n\n## Step 10: Sum the number of possible pairs for each $k^2$.\nWe found $1$ possible pair when $k^2 = 4$, $8$ possible pairs when $k^2 = 9$, and $10$ possible pairs when $k^2 = 16$. Let's calculate the total.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the total number of ordered pairs.\n$1 + 8 + 10 = 19$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$"
