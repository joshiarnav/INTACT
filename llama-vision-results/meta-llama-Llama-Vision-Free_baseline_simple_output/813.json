    "problem": "How many distinct six-letter rearrangements of the word ``Hawaii\" can I form?",
    "solution": "If every letter of ``Hawaii\" were different, there would be $6! = 6\\cdot 5 \\cdots 2 \\cdot 1$ distinct six-letter rearrangements, since for the first letter of the rearrangement there would be six letters to choose from, for the second there would be five, etc. However, ``Hawaii\" contains two copies of the letter $a$ and two copies of the letter $i$. Thus, we must divide by $2$ to eliminate the overcounting we get from two indistinguishable $a$'s, and we must divide by $2$ again to eliminate the overcounting we get from two indistinguishable $i$'s. Our final count is therefore $\\frac{6!}{2\\cdot 2}$. Canceling the $4$ top and bottom gives $6\\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 30 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{180}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem is asking for the number of distinct six-letter rearrangements of the word \"Hawaii\". Since the word has repeated letters, this is a classic problem involving permutations with repetition.\n## Step 2:  We have a total of 6 letters in the word, with 2 As, 2 Is, and one each of H, W, and other letters. If all letters were distinct, there would be 6! ways to arrange them.\n## Step 3:  However, due to the repetition of the letters A and I, we need to account for this by dividing the total number of arrangements by the factorial of the number of times each repeated letter occurs. This is because the repeated letters are indistinguishable in the context of the rearrangement, so we're overcounting by treating them as distinct.\n## Step 4:  For the letter A, there are 2 As, so we divide by 2! (2 factorial). Similarly, for the letter I, there are also 2 Is, so we also divide by 2!.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the formula for calculating the total number of distinct rearrangements is 6! / (2! * 2!).\n\n## Step 6:  Calculating 6! gives us 720.\n## Step 7:  Calculating 2! gives us 2.\n## Step 8:  Calculating 2! gives us 2.\n## Step 9:  Dividing 720 by 2 * 2 gives us 720 / 4 = 180.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{180}$"
