    "problem": "How many ways are there to arrange $6$ beads of distinct colors in a $2 \\times 3$ grid if reflections and rotations are considered the same? (In other words, two arrangements are considered the same if I can rotate and/or reflect one arrangement to get the other.)",
    "solution": "There are $6! = 720$ ways to put the beads on the grid ignoring distinguishability. On the other hand, there are $4$ possible transformations of the board using rotations and reflections (including the identity):\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}\nA & B & C & & C & B & A\\\\\nD & E & F & & F & E & D\n\\end{tabular}\\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}\nF & E & D & & D & E & F\\\\\nC & B & A & & A & B & C\n\\end{tabular}None of these transformations besides the identity fixes an arrangement, so each arrangement is equivalent to three others. As a result, there are $\\tfrac{720}{4} = \\boxed{180}$ different arrangements.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of arrangements of the $6$ beads in a $2 \\times 3$ grid, and then account for the symmetries caused by rotations and reflections.\n## Step 2:  First, we consider the total number of arrangements without any restrictions. Since the beads are distinct, we can arrange them in $6!$ ways.\n## Step 3:  However, we need to account for the symmetries caused by rotations and reflections. For the given $2 \\times 3$ grid, there are $4$ rotational symmetries and $4$ reflection symmetries, resulting in a total of $8$ symmetries.\n## Step 4:  Each arrangement can be rotated $4$ times to produce the same arrangement, which means each arrangement is counted $4$ times.\n## Step 5:  Similarly, each arrangement can be reflected $4$ times to produce the same arrangement.\n## Step 6:  Taking these symmetries into account, each distinct arrangement is counted $8$ times, so we need to divide the total number of arrangements by $8$ to get the actual number of distinct arrangements.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the $6$ beads in a $2 \\times 3$ grid, considering reflections and rotations as the same, is $\\frac{6!}{8} = \\frac{6!}{2^3 \\cdot 3} = 60$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{60}$"
