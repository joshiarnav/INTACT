    "problem": "I have 18 distinguishable socks in my drawer: 8 white, 6 brown, and 4 blue.  In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of the same color?",
    "solution": "The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue.  If the socks are white, there are $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ choices.  If the socks are brown, there are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ choices.  If the socks are blue, there is $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  So the total number of choices for socks is $28 + 15 + 6 = \\boxed{49}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, we'll calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of white socks from the 8 available white socks.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 socks from 8 white socks is given by the combination formula $C(8, 2)$, which is equal to $\\frac{8!}{2!6!}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 socks from 8 white socks.\n$\\frac{8!}{2!6!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28$\n\n## Step 3: Next, we'll calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of brown socks from the 6 available brown socks.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 socks from 6 brown socks is given by the combination formula $C(6, 2)$, which is equal to $\\frac{6!}{2!4!}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 socks from 6 brown socks.\n$\\frac{6!}{2!4!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15$\n\n## Step 5: Lastly, we'll calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of blue socks from the 4 available blue socks.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 socks from 4 blue socks is given by the combination formula $C(4, 2)$, which is equal to $\\frac{4!}{2!2!}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 socks from 4 blue socks.\n$\\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$\n\n## Step 7: To find the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color, we add the number of ways to choose white, brown, and blue socks.\nTotal ways = ways for white + ways for brown + ways for blue = 28 + 15 + 6\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color.\nTotal ways = 28 + 15 + 6 = 49\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{49}$"
