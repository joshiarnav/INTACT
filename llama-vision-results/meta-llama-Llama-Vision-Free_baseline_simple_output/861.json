    "problem": "3 cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that they can be arranged into a group of three consecutive cards, all of the same suit? For this problem, an Ace can either come before a 2 or after a King, but not both (so A23 and QKA both count, but KA2 doesn't).",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{52}{3} = 22,\\!100$ ways to choose 3 cards out of 52, without regard to order. For any suit, there are 12 possible triples of consecutive cards (since the three consecutive cards can start on an A, 2, 3, ..., or Q, but not on a K). Since there are 4 suits, there are $4\\cdot12=48$ valid triples. The chance that three cards chosen randomly are three consecutive cards of the same suit is therefore $\\frac{48}{22,\\!100}=\\boxed{\\frac{12}{5,\\!525}}$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the conditions for selecting three cards from a standard deck of 52 cards.\n## Step 2:  The cards must be of the same suit and in consecutive order. This means we have 4 possible suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades), and for each suit, there are 13 possible consecutive sequences of cards (Ace through King).\n## Step 3:  Therefore, the total number of ways to choose three consecutive cards of the same suit is the product of the number of suits and the number of possible sequences for each suit, which is $4 \\times 13 = 52$.\n## Step 4:  Now, we also need to consider the order in which these three cards can be arranged. Since the cards must be in consecutive order, there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the cards within a sequence.\n## Step 5:  So, the total number of ways to choose three consecutive cards of the same suit and arrange them in order is $52 \\times 6 = 312$.\n## Step 6:  However, we need to consider the total number of ways to choose any three cards from the deck. This is given by the combination formula, $\\binom{52}{3}$, which equals $22,100$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the probability that the chosen cards can be arranged into a group of three consecutive cards of the same suit is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.\n## Step 8:  The probability is calculated as $\\dfrac{312}{22100} = \\dfrac{12}{850}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{12}{850}}$"
