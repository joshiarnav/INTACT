    "problem": "Four points, $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle. What is the probability that segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect?",
    "solution": "Consider the four random points before they are labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$. In the general case, they will be distinct, forming a convex quadrilateral. Suppose $A$ is labeled. If $B$ is labeled as the vertex opposite $A$, segments $AB$ and $CD$ will intersect; otherwise, they will not. Since there are 3 points to label as $B$, the probability these segments intersect is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the conditions under which segments $AB$ and $CD$ will intersect when four points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle.\n## Step 2:  We can establish a correspondence between the points on the circle and the real numbers in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$, where the points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ correspond to the real numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively.\n## Step 3:  Without loss of generality, we can assume that point $A$ corresponds to $0$. Then, the circle can be represented on the coordinate plane, with the points on the circle corresponding to real numbers.\n## Step 4:  We can then consider the segments $AB$ and $CD$. These segments intersect if and only if $b - a < c - d < b - a + 2\\pi$ or $c - d < b - a < c - d + 2\\pi$. These conditions can be visualized on the coordinate plane, where $a$ and $b$ are represented on the x-axis, and $c$ and $d$ are represented on the y-axis.\n## Step 5:  By examining the regions of the coordinate plane that satisfy the conditions for intersection, we can identify the area where the segments intersect.\n## Step 6:  The region can be divided into two triangles, each with area $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\pi = \\frac{1}{8} \\pi$, and a square with area $\\pi^2$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the probability that the segments intersect is the ratio of the area of the shaded region to the area of the entire square, which is $\\frac{2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} \\pi + \\pi^2 - \\pi^2}{\\pi^2}$.\n## Step 8:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$"
