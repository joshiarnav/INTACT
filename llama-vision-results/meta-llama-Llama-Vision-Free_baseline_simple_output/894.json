    "problem": "Six cars pull up to a red light, one at a time. At the light, there are three lanes, one left-turn lane, one straight-going lane, and one right-turn lane. How many ways can the cars stack up so that all three lanes are occupied?\n\nNote that if the first car turns left and the second goes straight, this is considered different from the first car going straight and the second car turning left. In other words, the cars are distinguishable, but pull up to the intersection in a fixed order.",
    "solution": "We count the number of ways that some lane can be left empty, and subtract from the total number, $3^6=729$ because each driver has three choices. Suppose the left-turn lane is left empty. Then each driver is limited to 2 choices, and there are $2^6$ ways to leave the left-turn lane empty. The same logic gives $2^6$ ways to leave the center lane and right-turn lane open. But we have double-counted the situations where two lanes are left empty. Fortunately, since each driver must go into the third lane, there are only 3 situations we have over-counted. This leaves $3\\cdot2^6-3=189$ ways to leave at least one lane unoccupied, or $729-189=\\boxed{540}$ ways to occupy every lane.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Consider the possible ways each car can occupy the lanes.\nEach car has three options for its direction: left, straight, or right.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of possible ways all six cars can occupy the three lanes.\nSince there are three options for the first car, three for the second, three for the third, three for the fourth, three for the fifth, and three for the sixth, the total number of ways they can stack up is $3^6 = 729$.\n\n## Step 3: Consider that the number of ways each car can go is independent of the others.\nSince each car can choose any of the three lanes without restriction based on the choices of the other cars, we do not have to account for any additional constraints.\n\n## Step 4: Recognize that this problem is asking for the number of permutations of the six cars across the three lanes.\nHowever, the question is actually asking for the number of ways six cars can stack up so that all three lanes are occupied, not the permutations of the cars, so the cars are distinguishable in a specific order.\n\n## Step 5: However, we were wrong in the calculation in the previous steps.\nThe final answer should be the number of ways to pick 2 cars to go left, 2 cars to go right, and 2 cars to go straight, then multiply by the number of ways these cars can be ordered.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to pick 2 cars to go left, 2 cars to go right, and 2 cars to go straight.\nThere are $\\binom{6}{2}=15$ ways to pick the cars that go left, $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to pick the cars that go right, and $\\binom{2}{2}=1$ way to pick the cars that go straight.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of ways these cars can be ordered.\nThere are $\\frac{6!}{2!2!2!}=90$ ways to arrange the cars.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total number of ways the cars can stack up.\nTherefore, the total number of ways the cars can stack up is $15 \\times 6 \\times 1 \\times 90 = \\boxed{8100}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8100}$"
