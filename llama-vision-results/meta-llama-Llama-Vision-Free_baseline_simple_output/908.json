    "problem": "Seven cards each containing one of the following letters C, B, T, A, E, M and H are placed in a hat. Each letter is used only once. Stu will pull four cards out at random and without replacement. What is the probability that Stu pulls out M, A, T, H in this order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that Stu pulls the M out first is 1/7. The probability that he then pulls the A out next is 1/6, since there are now 6 letter remaining.  Continuing in this way, the probability that he pulls out T next is 1/5 and the probability that H then follows is 1/4.  Therefore, the probability that he pulls out M, A, T, H in this order is $1/7 \\times 1/6 \\times 1/5 \\times 1/4 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{840}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We first need to understand the total number of ways Stu can pull out four cards out of seven. This is a combination problem, where the order of selection does not matter, but in this specific case, we are interested in the order of M, A, T, and H being selected.\n## Step 2:  The first card Stu pulls out can be any of the 7 cards, so there are 7 possibilities for the first card.\n## Step 3:  After the first card is pulled, there are 6 cards remaining in the hat, so there are 6 possibilities for the second card.\n## Step 4:  After the second card is pulled, there are 5 cards remaining in the hat, so there are 5 possibilities for the third card.\n## Step 5:  Finally, after the third card is pulled, there are 4 cards remaining in the hat, so there are 4 possibilities for the fourth card.\n## Step 6:  However, since we are interested in the specific order of M, A, T, and H, we only want to count the number of ways these 4 cards can be selected in this order.\n## Step 7:  There is only 1 way to select the first card as M, 1 way to select the second card as A, 1 way to select the third card as T, and 1 way to select the fourth card as H, given that the previous cards have been selected.\n## Step 8:  However, the three other cards that Stu selects can be any of the 4 remaining cards in 4P3 = 4*3*2 = 24 ways.\n## Step 9:  We also need to consider the total number of possible four-card selections from the seven cards, which is 7P4 = 7*6*5*4 = 840.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the probability of selecting M, A, T, H in this order is 24/840 = 1/35.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{35}}$"
