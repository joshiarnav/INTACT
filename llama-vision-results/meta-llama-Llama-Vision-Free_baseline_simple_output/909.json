    "problem": "There are 190 people on the beach.  110 are wearing sunglasses, 70 are wearing bathing suits, and 95 are wearing a hat.  Everyone is wearing at least one of these items. 30 are wearing both bathing suits and sunglasses. 25 are wearing both bathing suits and a hat. 40 are wearing both sunglasses and a hat.  How many people are wearing all three items?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be number of people wearing all three items.  Since 30 people are wearing bathing suits and sunglasses, we know that $30 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and sunglasses.  Similarly, $25 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and hats, while $40 - x$ are wearing just sunglasses and a hat.\n\nTo find the number of people wearing just sunglasses, we subtract the people who are wearing sunglasses with other items from the total number of people wearing sunglasses, which is $110 - (30 - x) - (40 - x) - x = 40 + x$.  Similarly, the number of people wearing just hats is $30 + x$, while the number of people wearing just bathing suits is $15 + x$.\n\nSince the total number of people on the beach is 190, and everyone is wearing one of the items, we have: \\begin{align*}\n190 &= (15 + x) + (40 + x) + (30 + x) \\\\\n&\\qquad+ (25 - x ) + (30 - x) + (40 - x) + x\\\\\n&= 180 + x.\n\\end{align*} We can then solve for $x$, so the number of people on the beach wearing all three items is $x = \\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Start by adding the number of people wearing sunglasses, bathing suits, and hats, which gives us a total of 110 + 70 + 95 = 275.\n## Step 2:  However, since this counts people who are wearing two or more items multiple times, we need to adjust for this overcounting.\n## Step 3:  We know that 30 people are wearing both bathing suits and sunglasses, 25 are wearing both bathing suits and a hat, and 40 are wearing both sunglasses and a hat.\n## Step 4:  If we simply subtract the number of people wearing two items from our initial total, we would be subtracting too many people wearing all three items, as they are counted in all three overlaps.\n## Step 5:  To account for this, we add back the number of people wearing all three items three times, as each of these individuals was subtracted three times in our initial adjustment for overlaps.\n## Step 6:  So, our formula for finding the number of people wearing all three items must subtract the sum of the people wearing two items and add back the number of people wearing all three items.\n## Step 7:  Let's denote the number of people wearing all three items as x.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, we can write the equation: 110 + 70 + 95 - 30 - 25 - 40 + x = 190.\n## Step 9:  Now, simplify the equation and solve for x.\n## Step 10:  275 - 95 + x = 190, which simplifies to 180 + x = 190.\n## Step 11:  Subtract 180 from both sides to find x, which equals 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
