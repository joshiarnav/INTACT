    "solution": "Since there are 6 points, we have ${6 \\choose 2} = 15$ different line segments to connect the vertices. However, 6 of those line segments are the sides of the hexagon. The remaining $ 15 - 6 = \\boxed{9}$ segments are the diagonals of the hexagon.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the number of diagonals in a hexagon, we can use a formula that applies to any polygon.\n## Step 2:  The formula to find the number of diagonals in an $n$-sided polygon is $n(n-3)/2$.\n## Step 3:  This formula works because a diagonal is a line segment that connects two non-adjacent vertices of the polygon.\n## Step 4:  For each vertex of the polygon, there are $n-3$ other vertices that we can connect to, forming a diagonal.\n## Step 5:  However, this count includes each diagonal twice (once for each of its endpoints), so we need to divide the total count by $2$ to get the actual number of unique diagonals.\n## Step 6:  Applying this formula to a hexagon, which has $6$ sides, we get $6(6-3)/2 = 6(3)/2 = 9$ diagonals.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the hexagon $ABCDEF$ has $\\boxed{9}$ diagonals.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$"
