    "problem": "When two consecutive whole numbers are randomly selected, what is the probability that one of them is a multiple of 4? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "All whole numbers can be written as $4k$, $4k+1$, $4k+2$, or $4k+3$ for some integer $k$. Suppose we look at the smaller of the two consecutive numbers. If it is of the form $4k$, it is a multiple of 4. If it is of the form $4k+3$, the other is $4k+4$, a multiple of 4. If on the other hand, it can be written as $4k+1$ or $4k+2$, neither number is a multiple of 4. So in two of the four equally likely cases, one of the numbers is a multiple of 4, for a probability of $2/4=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the probability that one of the two consecutive whole numbers selected is a multiple of 4, we need to first identify the favorable outcomes.\n## Step 2:  We know that multiples of 4 occur every 4 numbers. Therefore, if we select two consecutive numbers, there are 4 possible scenarios in which one of them is a multiple of 4.\n## Step 3:  Out of these 4 scenarios, there are two possibilities: either the first number is a multiple of 4 or the second number is a multiple of 4.\n## Step 4:  When the first number is a multiple of 4, the second number will be two more than a multiple of 4. This case can be represented as $(4n, 4n+2)$, where $n$ is any whole number.\n## Step 5:  Conversely, when the second number is a multiple of 4, the first number will be two less than a multiple of 4. This case can be represented as $(4n-2, 4n)$, where $n$ is any whole number.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, there are a total of $4$ possibilities when one of the numbers is a multiple of 4.\n## Step 7:  However, we also need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes when two consecutive whole numbers are selected. Since we are choosing 2 numbers from a set of consecutive whole numbers, there are $4^2 = 16$ total possibilities.\n## Step 8:  Having identified the favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes, we can now calculate the probability that one of the two consecutive numbers is a multiple of 4.\n## Step 9:  Probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, it is $\\frac{4}{16}$.\n## Step 10:  We can simplify the fraction $\\frac{4}{16}$ by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4.\n## Step 11:  Dividing both 4 and 16 by 4, we get $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, the probability that one of the two consecutive whole numbers is a multiple of 4 is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$"
