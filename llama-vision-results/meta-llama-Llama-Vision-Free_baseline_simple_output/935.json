    "problem": "A PE class has 12 students, 6 girls and 6 boys. The coach has 4 jerseys in each of 3 colors to mark 3 teams for a soccer tournament. If the coach wants at least one girl and at least one boy on each team, how many ways can he give out the jerseys? (Jerseys of the same color are indistinguishable.)",
    "solution": "In all, disregarding the gender rule, there are $$\\binom{12}4\\binom84=\\frac{12\\cdot11\\cdot10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7\\cdot6\\cdot5}{4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot4\\cdot3\\cdot2}=34650$$ways of assigning the teams. We will count the number of ways a team can have all boys or all girls and subtract from this total.\n\nThere are 2 choices for the violating gender and 3 choices for the violating color. Once these are picked, there are $\\binom64=15$ ways to choose the violating team, and $\\binom84=70$ ways to pick the other two teams, for a total of $2\\cdot3\\cdot15\\cdot70=6300$ ways to choose a violating team. However, this procedure double-counts the assignments that make one team all girls and another all boys. There are 3 choices for the girls team and then 2 choices for the boys team, and $\\binom64^2=225$ ways to choose the teams, for a total of $2\\cdot3\\cdot225=1350$ double-counted arrangements, leaving $6300-1350=4950$ ways to make a team all girls or all boys. Subtracting this from the total, we get $34650-4950=\\boxed{29700}$ ways for the coach to assign the teams.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, let's break down the problem into choosing the teams.\nWe have 12 students, 6 girls and 6 boys. We want at least one girl and one boy on each of the 3 teams.\n\n## Step 2: We need to find the number of ways to choose the teams such that each team has at least one girl and one boy.\nLet's consider the cases where we choose 1 girl and 5 boys, 2 girls and 4 boys, 3 girls and 3 boys, 4 girls and 2 boys, and 5 girls and 1 boy.\n\n## Step 3: Case 1: 1 girl and 5 boys\nThere are $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to choose 1 girl and $\\binom{6}{5} = 6$ ways to choose 5 boys. The number of ways to choose 1 girl is 6, and the number of ways to choose 5 boys is 6. Since there are 3 teams, there are $3! \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6$ ways to choose the teams.\n\n## Step 4: Case 2: 2 girls and 4 boys\nThere are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose 2 girls and $\\binom{6}{4} = 15$ ways to choose 4 boys. The number of ways to choose 2 girls is 15, and the number of ways to choose 4 boys is 15. Since there are 3 teams, there are $3! \\cdot 15 \\cdot 15$ ways to choose the teams.\n\n## Step 5: Case 3: 3 girls and 3 boys\nThere are $\\binom{6}{3} = 20$ ways to choose 3 girls and $\\binom{6}{3} = 20$ ways to choose 3 boys. The number of ways to choose 3 girls is 20, and the number of ways to choose 3 boys is 20. Since there are 3 teams, there are $3! \\cdot 20 \\cdot 20$ ways to choose the teams.\n\n## Step 6: Case 4: 4 girls and 2 boys\nThere are $\\binom{6}{4} = 15$ ways to choose 4 girls and $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose 2 boys. The number of ways to choose 4 girls is 15, and the number of ways to choose 2 boys is 15. Since there are 3 teams, there are $3! \\cdot 15 \\cdot 15$ ways to choose the teams.\n\n## Step 7: Case 5: 5 girls and 1 boy\nThere are $\\binom{6}{5} = 6$ ways to choose 5 girls and $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to choose 1 boy. The number of ways to choose 5 girls is 6, and the number of ways to choose 1 boy is 6. Since there are 3 teams, there are $3! \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6$ ways to choose the teams.\n\n## Step 8: Now, let's find the total number of ways to choose the teams by adding the number of ways for each case.\nThe total number of ways is $3! \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 + 3! \\cdot 15 \\cdot 15 + 3! \\cdot 20 \\cdot 20 + 3! \\cdot 15 \\cdot 15 + 3! \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6$\n\n## Step 9: We can simplify the expression.\n$3! \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 + 3! \\cdot 15 \\cdot 15 + 3! \\cdot 20 \\cdot 20 + 3! \\cdot 15 \\cdot 15 + 3! \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 = 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 + 15 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 6 + 20 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 6 + 15 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 6 + 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6$\n\n## Step 10: Now, let's find the total number of ways to give out the jerseys.\nThere are 4 jerseys in each color, so for each team, there are $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways to choose 3 jerseys of the same color. Since there are 3 colors and 3 teams, the number of ways to choose the jerseys is $4^3$.\n\n## Step 11: Finally, let's multiply the number of ways to choose the teams and the number of ways to give out the jerseys.\nThe total number of ways is $6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 + 15 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 6 + 20 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 6 + 15 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 6 + 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4^3 = 216 + 1350 + 2400 + 1350 + 216 \\cdot 64$\n\n## Step 12: Now, let's calculate the total number of ways.\n$216 + 1350 + 2400 + 1350 + 216 \\cdot 64 = 216 + 1350 + 2400 + 1350 + 13824$\n\n## Step 13: Finally, let's add the numbers together.\n$216 + 1350 + 2400 + 1350 + 13824 = 19140$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19140}$"
