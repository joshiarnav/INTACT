    "problem": "Chris wants to put six plants in a row on his windowsill. He randomly chooses each plant to be an aloe plant, a basil plant, or a violet. What is the probability that either exactly four of the plants are aloe plants or exactly five of the plants are basil plants?",
    "solution": "It is impossible for Chris to have both four aloe plants and five basil plants, so first we consider the case of four aloe plants. There are $\\binom{6}{4}=15$ ways to choose which of the plants are the aloe plants. For each of these choices, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) ^2$ chance of that choice happening. Therefore, the total probability that Chris chooses exactly four aloe plants is $15\\cdot\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) ^2=\\frac{20}{243}$. There are $\\binom{6}{5}=6$ ways to choose five plants to be the basil plants. For each of these choices, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^5 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) ^1$ chance of that choice happening. Therefore, the total probability that Chris chooses exactly five basil plants is $6\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^5 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) ^1=\\frac{4}{243}$. The probability that Chris chooses either four aloe plants or five basil plants is $\\frac{24}{243}=\\boxed{\\frac{8}{81}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are tasked with finding the probability that either exactly four of the plants are aloe plants or exactly five of the plants are basil plants when Chris randomly chooses each plant to be an aloe plant, a basil plant, or a violet.\n## Step 2:  First, we need to determine the total number of possible ways to arrange the plants in a row on the windowsill. Since Chris has 3 choices for each plant, and there are 6 plants in total, the total number of possible arrangements is $3^6 = 729$.\n## Step 3:  Next, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 4 aloe plants out of 6. This can be done using the combination formula $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of plants and $r$ is the number of aloe plants. So, the number of ways to choose 4 aloe plants is $\\binom{6}{4} = 15$.\n## Step 4:  After choosing the 4 aloe plants, there are 2 remaining spots for the basil and violet plants. Since Chris has 2 choices for each of these remaining spots, the total number of ways to choose the remaining plants is $2^2 = 4$. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose exactly 4 aloe plants is $15 \\times 4 = 60$.\n## Step 5:  Next, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 5 basil plants. This can also be done using the combination formula, $\\binom{6}{5} = 6$. After choosing the 5 basil plants, there is 1 remaining spot for the aloe or violet plant. Since Chris has 2 choices for this remaining spot, the total number of ways to choose the remaining plant is $2$. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose exactly 5 basil plants is $6 \\times 2 = 12$.\n## Step 6:  Having found the number of ways to choose exactly 4 aloe plants and exactly 5 basil plants, we can now calculate the probability of each event occurring. The probability of choosing exactly 4 aloe plants is $\\frac{60}{729}$, and the probability of choosing exactly 5 basil plants is $\\frac{12}{729}$.\n## Step 7:  Finally, we add these two probabilities together to find the total probability of either event occurring.\n## Step 8:  The total probability is $\\frac{60}{729} + \\frac{12}{729} = \\frac{72}{729} = \\frac{8}{81}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{81}}$"
