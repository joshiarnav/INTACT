    "problem": "How many of the factorials from 1! to 100! are divisible by 9?",
    "solution": "To have 9 as a factor, $n!$ must have two factors of 3.  The first such $n$ for which this is true is 6, since  $6! = \\textbf{6} \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times \\textbf{3} \\times 2 \\times 1$.  Since 9 is a factor of $6!$ and $6!$ is a factor of $n!$ for all $n \\ge 6$, the numbers $6!, 7!, 8!, \\ldots, 99!, 100!$ are all divisible by 9.  There are $100 - 6 + 1 = \\boxed{95}$ numbers in that list.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find out how many numbers from 1 to 100 are divisible by 9.\n## Step 2:  However, it's easier to determine how many factorials from 1! to 100! are divisible by 9.\n## Step 3:  A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n## Step 4:  In this case, we need to find the sum of the digits of each number's factorial.\n## Step 5:  We can find a pattern to determine when a factorial's sum of digits will be divisible by 9.\n## Step 6:  We notice that for any number n \u2265 10, the sum of the digits of n! will always be divisible by 9 because n! will include the numbers 9 and 10, which sum to 19. Since 19 is divisible by 9, the sum of the digits of n! will also be divisible by 9.\n## Step 7:  We don't need to calculate the sum of digits for each factorial from 1 to 9, as we know that 1! to 8! are not divisible by 9.\n## Step 8:  We also know that from 9! to 100!, every factorial is divisible by 9.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, we can conclude that the number of factorials from 1! to 100! that are divisible by 9 is equal to the number of factorials from 9! to 100!, which is 100 - 9 + 1 = 92.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{92}$"
