    "problem": "On the $xy$-plane, the origin is labeled with an $M$. The points $(1,0)$, $(-1,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(0,-1)$ are labeled with $A$'s. The points $(2,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(0,2)$, $(-1, 1)$, $(-2, 0)$, $(-1, -1)$, $(0, -2)$, and $(1, -1)$ are labeled with $T$'s. The points $(3,0)$, $(2,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(0, 3)$, $(-1, 2)$, $(-2, 1)$, $(-3, 0)$, $(-2,-1)$, $(-1,-2)$, $(0, -3)$, $(1, -2)$, and $(2, -1)$ are labeled with $H$'s. If you are only allowed to move up, down, left, and right, starting from the origin, how many distinct paths can be followed to spell the word MATH?",
    "solution": "From the M, we can proceed to four different As. Note that the letters are all symmetric, so we can simply count one case (say, that of moving from M to the bottom A) and then multiply by four.\n\nFrom the bottom A, we can proceed to any one of three Ts. From the two Ts to the sides of the A, we can proceed to one of two Hs. From the T that is below the A, we can proceed to one of three Hs. Thus, this case yields $2 \\cdot 2 + 3 = 7$ paths.\n\nThus, there are $4 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{28}$ distinct paths.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of distinct paths that can be followed to spell the word MATH on the given grid.\n## Step 2:  We start by labeling the points on the grid with M, A's, T's, and H's, and then we need to find the paths that spell the word MATH.\n## Step 3:  The word MATH has 4 letters, so we need to find the number of distinct paths from the origin to each letter and then multiply these numbers to get the total number of paths.\n## Step 4:  Let's break down the problem into four parts: finding the number of paths to the letter M, the number of paths to the letter A, the number of paths to the letter T, and the number of paths to the letter H.\n## Step 5:  To find the number of paths to the letter M, we need to count the paths that end at the origin. There is only one such path, which is staying at the origin.\n## Step 6:  Next, let's consider the number of paths to the letter A. We need to count the paths that end at the points (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1). There are 2 paths to (1,0) and (-1,0), and 1 path to (0,1) and (0,-1).\n## Step 7:  Now, we move on to the letter T. We need to count the paths that end at the points (2,0), (-2,0), (1,1), (-1,1), (0,2), (-1,-1), (0,-2), or (1,-1). There are 4 paths to (2,0) and (-2,0), 2 paths to (1,1) and (-1,1), and 2 paths to (0,2) and (0,-2), and 2 paths to (1,-1).\n## Step 8:  Finally, we need to count the number of paths to the letter H. We need to count the paths that end at the points (3,0), (-3,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,3), (-1,2), (-2,1), (-3,0), (-2,-1), (-1,-2), (0,-3), (1,-2), or (2,-1). There are 8 paths to (3,0) and (-3,0), 4 paths to (2,1), and 4 paths to (1,2) and (-1,2), 4 paths to (0,3) and (0,-3), 4 paths to (-2,1), 4 paths to (-1,-2), and 2 paths to (1,-2) and (2,-1).\n## Step 9:  To find the total number of distinct paths to spell the word MATH, we need to multiply the number of paths to each letter: $1 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 12$.\n## Step 10:  After multiplying these numbers, we get $1 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 12 = 384$ paths.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{384}$"
