    "problem": "A theater group has eight members, of which four are females. How many ways are there to assign the roles of a play that involve one female lead, one male lead, and three different objects that can be played by either gender?",
    "solution": "There are 4 ways to select the female lead and 4 ways to select the male lead. Afterwards, there are 6 members who can play the first inanimate object, 5 who can play the second, and 4 for the last.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $4\\times4\\times6\\times5\\times4 = \\boxed{1920\\text{ ways.}}$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose the female lead\nThere are 4 females in the theater group, so there are 4 ways to choose the female lead.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose the male lead after choosing the female lead\nAfter choosing the female lead, there are 7 members left in the group, of which 4 are males. So, there are 4 ways to choose the male lead.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose the three objects\nThere are 6 members left in the group, and any of them can play the three objects. We need to choose 3 people out of 6 for the objects, which can be done in 6 choose 3 ways, denoted as C(6,3). We calculate this using the formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!). C(6,3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 6! / (3! * 3!) = (6*5*4)/(3*2) = 20\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways to assign the roles\nThe total number of ways is the product of the number of ways to choose the female lead, the male lead, and the objects. Total ways = 4 * 4 * 20 = 320\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{320}$"
