    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are tasked with finding the probability that the sum of the rounded values of two randomly selected numbers between 0 and 1 equals the rounded value of their sum.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the possible values of A, B, and C\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are rounded to the nearest integer, the possible values of $A$, $B$, and $C$ are 0 and 1.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the cases where A + B = C\nWe can break down the problem into several cases where $A + B = C$ is possible. We can have $A = B = 0$ and $C = 0$ when $a$ and $b$ are both close to 0 and $c$ is also close to 0. We can have $A = B = 1$ and $C = 2$ when $a$ and $b$ are both close to 1 and $c$ is also close to 2, but since $c$ is the sum of $a$ and $b$, this case is impossible. We can have $A = B = 0$ and $C = 1$ when $a$ and $b$ are both close to 0, and $c$ is close to 1. We can have $A = B = 1$ and $C = 0$ when $a$ and $b$ are both close to 1, and $c$ is close to 2, but since $c$ is the sum of $a$ and $b$, this case is impossible. We can have $A = 0$ and $B = 1$, and $C = 1$ when $a$ is close to 0, $b$ is close to 1, and $c$ is close to 1. We can have $A = 1$ and $B = 0$, and $C = 1$ when $a$ is close to 1, $b$ is close to 0, and $c$ is close to 1.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the case when A = B = 0 and C = 0\nIn this case, we need $a$ and $b$ to be between 0 and 0.5, so $c$ will also be between 0 and 1. Therefore, the probability that $A = B = 0$ and $C = 0$ is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the case when A = B = 0 and C = 1\nIn this case, we need $c$ to be between 0.5 and 1. Since $c$ is the sum of $a$ and $b$, the probability that $A = B = 0$ and $C = 1$ is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the case when A = B = 1 and C = 0\nThis case is impossible since $c$ is always greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 2, and $c$ cannot be 0 if $a$ and $b$ are 1.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the case when A = 0 and B = 1, and C = 1\nIn this case, we need $a$ to be between 0 and 0.5, and $b$ to be between 0.5 and 1. Therefore, the probability that $A = 0$ and $B = 1$ and $C = 1$ is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the case when A = 1 and B = 0, and C = 1\nThis case is the same as the case when $A = 0$ and $B = 1$ and $C = 1$, since the order of $a$ and $b$ does not matter. Therefore, the probability that $A = 1$ and $B = 0$ and $C = 1$ is also 0.25.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the total probability\nTo calculate the total probability that $A + B = C$, we add up the probabilities of each case. However, we must be careful not to count the same case multiple times.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the total probability\nThe total probability is the sum of the probabilities of the cases where $A + B = C$. We have 0.25 for the case when $A = B = 0$ and $C = 0$, 0.25 for the case when $A = B = 0$ and $C = 1$, 0.25 for the case when $A = 0$ and $B = 1$ and $C = 1$, and 0.25 for the case when $A = 1$ and $B = 0$ and $C = 1$. Therefore, the total probability is 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.5}$"
