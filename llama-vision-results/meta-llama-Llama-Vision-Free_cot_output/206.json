For example, if Annie arrived at 2:00, Xenas could arrive at any time between 2:00 and 2:45 and see Annie at the party.  Let one hour equal one unit.  Then, we can calculate the area of the shaded region as the area of the entire square minus the areas of the two unshaded triangles.  This equals $$2\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4}=\\frac{25}{16}.$$ So the area of the shaded region is $$4-\\frac{25}{16}=\\frac{64-25}{16}= \\frac{39}{16}.$$ Since the area of the square is 4, the probability that Annie and Xenas see each other at the party is $$\\dfrac{39/16}{4} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{39}{64}}.$$",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find**\n\nWe are given that Annie and Xenas arrive at a party at a random time between 2:00 and 4:00, stay for 45 minutes, and then leave. We need to find the probability that Annie and Xenas see each other at the party.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need**\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of geometric probability, which involves representing the possible outcomes as points in a geometric region. In this case, we can represent the arrival times of Annie and Xenas as points in a square, where the x-axis represents the arrival time of Annie and the y-axis represents the arrival time of Xenas.\n\nThe key formula we need is the area of the region where Annie and Xenas see each other, divided by the total area of the square.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step**\n\nLet's consider the square with side length 2 (representing the 2-hour time interval from 2:00 to 4:00). The total area of the square is 2^2 = 4 square units.\n\nNow, let's find the area of the region where Annie and Xenas see each other. We can do this by finding the area of the region where their arrival times overlap.\n\nTo do this, we can find the area of the region where Annie arrives before Xenas and the area of the region where Xenas arrives before Annie, and then subtract the overlap.\n\nLet's draw a diagram to visualize the situation:\n\nAnnie arrives between 2:00 and 4:00, and Xenas arrives between 2:00 and 4:00.\n\nThe shaded region represents the area where Annie arrives before Xenas. The area of this region is:\n\n* 2 hours x 45 minutes = 1.5 hours x 45 minutes = 67.5 minutes\n* Convert 67.5 minutes to hours: 67.5 minutes / 60 = 1.125 hours\n* Area of shaded region = 1.125 hours x 1.75 hours (since Xenas can arrive up to 1.75 hours after 2:00) = 1.96875 square units\n\nSimilarly, the shaded region represents the area where Xenas arrives before Annie. The area of this region is the same as the area of the first shaded region.\n\nTo find the total area where Annie and Xenas see each other, we need to subtract the overlap from the sum of the two shaded regions. However, we can also find the overlap directly.\n\nThe overlap is the area where Annie arrives within 45 minutes after Xenas and the area where Xenas arrives within 45 minutes after Annie. This is a square with side length 1.25 hours (45 minutes / 60).\n\nThe area of the overlap is:\n\n* 1.25 hours x 1.25 hours = 1.5625 square units\n\nNow, let's find the probability that Annie and Xenas see each other. We can do this by dividing the area of the region where they see each other (which is the total area minus the overlap) by the total area of the square.\n\nProbability = (4 - 1.5625) / 4 = 2.4375 / 4 = 0.609375\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer yet! We need to simplify this fraction to get the final answer.\n\n**Step 4: Verify our answer and express it in the required format**\n\nWe can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 0.015625. This gives us:\n\nProbability = 0.609375 / 0.015625 = 39/61\n\nSo, the probability that Annie and Xenas see each other at the party is 39/61."
