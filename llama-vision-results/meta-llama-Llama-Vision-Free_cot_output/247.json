    "model_solution": "To solve the problem, we'll follow the steps you outlined.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find**\n\nWe are given the problem to compute $\\dbinom{15}{2}$, which represents the number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of 15 items, without regard to the order of selection. We need to find the numerical value of this expression.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas**\n\nThe key concept here is combinations, which is represented by the formula: $\\dbinom{n}{r} = \\dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $r$ is the number of items to choose, and $!$ denotes the factorial function.\n\nIn this case, we have $n = 15$ and $r = 2$. We will use this formula to compute the value of $\\dbinom{15}{2}$.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step**\n\nNow, let's plug in the values into the formula:\n\n$\\dbinom{15}{2} = \\dfrac{15!}{2!(15-2)!}$\n\nFirst, let's simplify the factorials:\n\n$15! = 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$\n\n$2! = 2 \\times 1$\n\n$13! = 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$\n\nNow, let's plug these values back into the formula:\n\n$\\dbinom{15}{2} = \\dfrac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13!}{2! \\times 13!}$\n\nSimplify further by canceling out the common terms:\n\n$\\dbinom{15}{2} = \\dfrac{15 \\times 14}{2 \\times 1}$\n\n$\\dbinom{15}{2} = \\dfrac{210}{2}$\n\n$\\dbinom{15}{2} = 105$\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer and express it in the required format**\n\nWe have computed the value of $\\dbinom{15}{2}$ to be 105. This is the final answer.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n$\\dbinom{15}{2} = \\boxed{105}$"
