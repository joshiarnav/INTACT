    "problem": "An ant is walking on a hexagon. At each step, he moves from the vertex on which he is standing to an adjacent vertex. After $15$ steps, what is the probability that he is standing on the same vertex on which he began?",
    "solution": "There are two ways in which the ant can return to his original vertex: either he can go part of the way around the hexagon and then retrace his steps, or he can go all the way around the hexagon. In the first case, the ant necessarily moves an even number of steps, because his total number of steps is twice the number of steps needed to get to the point at which he begins to retrace. In the second case, because a hexagon has an even number of vertices, the ant is again moving an even number of steps. Thus, he has no way to return to the vertex on which he began in an odd number of steps, so the probability is $\\boxed{0}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find**\n\nWe have an ant walking on a hexagon, and at each step, it moves to an adjacent vertex. We want to find the probability that after 15 steps, the ant is standing on the same vertex where it began.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of permutations and the properties of hexagons. We can use the fact that there are 6 vertices in a hexagon, and at each step, the ant moves to one of these 6 vertices.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step**\n\nLet's break down the problem into smaller steps:\n\n* After 1 step, the ant has 6 possible positions.\n* After 2 steps, the ant has 6^2 = 36 possible positions.\n* After 3 steps, the ant has 6^3 = 216 possible positions.\n* ...\n* After 15 steps, the ant has 6^15 possible positions.\n\nHowever, we only care about the cases where the ant ends up on the same vertex where it started. To count these cases, we can observe that the ant can never return to its starting vertex after an odd number of steps. This is because the ant can only move to an adjacent vertex, so it can never \"turn back\" to the starting vertex.\n\nTherefore, we only need to consider the cases where the ant takes an even number of steps. Let's count these cases:\n\n* After 2 steps, there are 5 possible positions (since the ant can move to any of the 5 adjacent vertices).\n* After 4 steps, there are 5^2 = 25 possible positions.\n* After 6 steps, there are 5^3 = 125 possible positions.\n* ...\n* After 14 steps, there are 5^7 = 78125 possible positions.\n\nWe can see that the number of possible positions is increasing rapidly, but we can still calculate it.\n\nHowever, we can take a shortcut. Since the ant can never return to its starting vertex after an odd number of steps, the probability of returning to its starting vertex is 0 after an odd number of steps. Since 15 is an odd number, the probability of returning to its starting vertex is 0.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer and express it in the required format**\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"
