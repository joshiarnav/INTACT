    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are distinguishable and the boxes are distinguishable?",
    "solution": "There are 3 different boxes, so each of the 5 balls can be placed in three different locations.  So the answer is $3^5 = \\boxed{243}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find.**\n\nWe have 5 distinguishable balls and 3 distinguishable boxes. We need to find the number of ways to distribute the 5 balls into the 3 boxes.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need.**\n\nSince the balls are distinguishable and the boxes are distinguishable, we can use the concept of permutations to solve this problem. Specifically, we can use the fact that each ball has 3 choices of boxes to be placed in, and we need to make 5 independent choices.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step.**\n\nFor each of the 5 balls, there are 3 choices of boxes to be placed in. Since the choices are independent, we can multiply the number of choices together to get the total number of ways.\n\nSo, the number of ways to put 5 balls in 3 boxes is:\n3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 = 3^5 = 243\n\n**Step 4: Verify our answer and express it in the required format.**\n\nOur answer is 243. This means that there are 243 ways to put 5 distinguishable balls into 3 distinguishable boxes.\n\nTherefore, our final answer is:\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{243}$"
