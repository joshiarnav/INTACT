    "problem": "A cook has 10 red peppers and 5 green peppers. If the cook selects 6 peppers at random, what is the probability that he selects at least 4 green peppers? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We can count the number of ways to choose a group of 4 green and 2 red peppers and the number of ways to choose 5 green and 1 red peppers. These are $\\binom{5}{4}\\binom{10}{2}=5\\cdot45=225$ and $\\binom{5}{5}\\binom{10}{1}=10$. The total number of ways the cook can choose peppers is $\\binom{15}{6}=5005$. Therefore, the probability that out of six randomly chosen peppers at least four will be green is $\\frac{235}{5005}=\\boxed{\\frac{47}{1001}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**1. Understand what we're given and what we need to find:**\n\nWe have:\n- 10 red peppers\n- 5 green peppers\n- The cook selects 6 peppers at random\n\nWe need to find:\n- The probability that the cook selects at least 4 green peppers\n\n**2. Identify the key concepts and formulas we need:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll use the concept of combinations and the formula for probability:\n\n* Combinations: Calculate the number of ways to select a certain number of items from a larger group, without regard to the order.\n* Probability: The number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items being selected.\n\n**3. Solve the problem step by step:**\n\nTo find the probability of selecting at least 4 green peppers, we can use the complementary probability approach. We'll calculate the probability of selecting fewer than 4 green peppers (0, 1, or 2 green peppers) and subtract that from 1.\n\n**Step 3a:** Calculate the number of ways to select 0, 1, or 2 green peppers and 6 peppers in total.\n\nWe'll use the combination formula to calculate the number of ways to select the desired number of green peppers and red peppers.\n\n**Step 3b:** Calculate the total number of ways to select 6 peppers from the 15 available peppers.\n\nWe'll use the combination formula to calculate the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n**Step 3c:** Calculate the probability of selecting 0, 1, or 2 green peppers and 6 peppers in total.\n\nWe'll divide the number of ways to select 0, 1, or 2 green peppers by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n**Step 3d:** Calculate the probability of selecting at least 4 green peppers using the complementary probability approach.\n\nWe'll subtract the probability of selecting 0, 1, or 2 green peppers from 1.\n\nNow, let's calculate the values:\n\n**Step 3a:**\n\n* Select 0 green peppers: C(5, 0) \u00d7 C(10, 6) = 1 \u00d7 210 = 210\n* Select 1 green pepper: C(5, 1) \u00d7 C(10, 5) = 5 \u00d7 252 = 1260\n* Select 2 green peppers: C(5, 2) \u00d7 C(10, 4) = 10 \u00d7 210 = 2100\n\n**Step 3b:**\n\n* Total number of ways to select 6 peppers: C(15, 6) = 5005\n\n**Step 3c:**\n\n* Probability of selecting 0, 1, or 2 green peppers: (210 + 1260 + 2100) / 5005 = 3570 / 5005\n\n**Step 3d:**\n\n* Probability of selecting at least 4 green peppers: 1 - 3570/5005 = (5005 - 3570) / 5005 = 1435 / 5005\n\nNow, let's verify our answer and express it in the required format.\n\n**4. Verify our answer and express it in the required format:**\n\nWe've calculated the probability of selecting at least 4 green peppers as 1435/5005.\n\nTo verify, we can use a calculator or a computer program to calculate the probability using the combination formula.\n\nAfter verification, we can express the answer in the required format.\n\nLet's express the answer as a common fraction:\n\nThe final answer is:"
