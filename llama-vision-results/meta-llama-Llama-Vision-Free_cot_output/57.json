    "problem": "Carson flips over the cards of a standard 52-card deck one at a time. What is the probability that he flips over the ace of spades before any face card (jack, queen or king)?",
    "solution": "There are 12 face cards, three from each suit. Within the deck, the 13 relevant cards (the face cards and the ace of spades) are arranged in some order. The probability that the first of these 13 cards is the ace is therefore $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{13}}$.",

    "model_solution": "I'll help you solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find**\n\nWe are given a standard 52-card deck, and Carson is flipping over the cards one at a time. We need to find the probability that he flips over the ace of spades before any face card (jack, queen, or king).\n\n**Step 2: Identify key concepts and formulas**\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll use the following concepts:\n\n* A standard deck has 52 cards: 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades) with 13 cards each (ace through king).\n* The ace of spades is one of the 52 cards.\n* The face cards (jacks, queens, and kings) are 12 cards in total.\n* The probability of an event is defined as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step**\n\nLet's break down the problem into smaller parts:\n\n**Part 1: Find the probability that the ace of spades is the first card**\n\nIf the ace of spades is the first card, then Carson has a 1 in 52 chance of drawing it first.\n\n**Part 2: Find the probability that the ace of spades is not the first card, but is drawn before any face card**\n\nIf the ace of spades is not the first card, then Carson has 51 cards left. The probability that he draws a non-face card first (including the ace of spades) is 40/51 (since there are 40 non-face cards).\n\nOnce he draws a non-face card, there are 50 cards left. The probability that he draws the ace of spades before any face card is 1/50 (since there is only 1 ace of spades and 48 non-face cards left).\n\n**Part 3: Combine the probabilities**\n\nThe probability that Carson draws the ace of spades before any face card is the sum of the probabilities in Part 1 and Part 2:\n\n(1/52) + (40/51 \u00d7 1/50) = 1/52 + 40/2550\n\n**Simplifying the expression**\n\nTo simplify the expression, we'll find a common denominator (2550) and add the fractions:\n\n(1/52) \u00d7 (49/49) = 49/2550\n(40/51) \u00d7 (50/50) = 2000/2550\nTotal = (49 + 2000)/2550 = 2049/2550\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer and express it in the required format**\n\nOur final answer is 2049/2550. To express it as a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:\n\n2049 \u00f7 2550 \u2248 0.8036\n\nHowever, we are not asked to provide a decimal answer. The answer is a fraction, and we have expressed it in the required format.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2049}{2550}}$"
