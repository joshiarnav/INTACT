    "model_solution": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find**\n\nWe are given the expression $\\dbinom{n}{n}$, and we need to find its value for any positive integer $n$. The expression $\\dbinom{n}{n}$ represents the number of ways to choose $n$ items from a set of $n$ items, which is also known as a combination.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the formula for combinations:\n\n$$\\dbinom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$\n\nwhere $n!$ represents the factorial of $n$, which is the product of all positive integers from 1 to $n$. In this case, we have $r=n$, so we need to find:\n\n$$\\dbinom{n}{n} = \\frac{n!}{n!(n-n)!}$$\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step**\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression:\n\n$$\\dbinom{n}{n} = \\frac{n!}{n!(n-n)!}$$\n\nSince $n-n=0$, we have:\n\n$$\\dbinom{n}{n} = \\frac{n!}{n!0!}$$\n\nWe know that $0!=1$, so we can simplify further:\n\n$$\\dbinom{n}{n} = \\frac{n!}{n!}$$\n\nAny non-zero number divided by itself is equal to 1, so we have:\n\n$$\\dbinom{n}{n} = 1$$\n\n**Step 4: Verify our answer and express it in the required format**\n\nWe have found that $\\dbinom{n}{n}=1$ for any positive integer $n$. This makes sense, because choosing all $n$ items from a set of $n$ items is equivalent to choosing no extra items, which can only be done in one way.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
