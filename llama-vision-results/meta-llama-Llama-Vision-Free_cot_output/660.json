    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find\nWe are given a grid with points A, C, and B. We need to find the number of paths from point C to point B, where every step must be up or to the right.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand that each path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) steps. The number of steps to the right is equal to the number of columns between C and B, and the number of steps up is equal to the number of rows between C and B. We can use combinatorics to find the total number of possible paths.\n\n## Step 3: Count the total number of steps to the right and up\nThe point C is located at (1, 2) and point B is located at (5, 4). This means there are 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up.\n\n## Step 4: Use combinatorics to find the total number of possible paths\nWe have a total of 6 steps, with 4 being steps to the right and 2 being steps up. We can choose the 2 steps up from the total 6 steps in $\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!4!} = 15$ ways.\n\n## Step 5: Verify our answer\nWe have found that there are 15 possible paths from point C to point B.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
