    "solution": "In general, \\[(a+b)^3=a^3+3a^2b+3ab^2+b^3\\]\n\nConsider the decimal part separately, so we're trying to find the greatest integer less than $(10+0.3)^3$. By the Binomial Theorem in the above expansion, this is equal to  \\[10^3+3(10^2)(.3)+3(10)(.3^2)+.3^3\\] Expanding these terms, we have that $(10.3)^3=1000+90+2.7+.027$. From this, we find that the greatest integer less than this quantity is $\\boxed{1092}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find**\n\nWe are given the expression $10.3^3$ and we need to find the greatest integer less than this value without using a calculator.\n\n**Step 2: Identify key concepts and formulas**\n\nSince we're dealing with exponentiation, we can use the fact that $a^3 = a \\cdot a \\cdot a$. We can also break down the number 10.3 into its decimal and integer parts, which are 10 and 0.3, respectively.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step**\n\nLet's start by expanding the expression:\n\n$10.3^3 = 10^3 \\cdot (1 + 0.3)^3$\n\nWe can now use the fact that $(1+x)^3 = 1 + 3x + 3x^2 + x^3$ to expand the expression further:\n\n$10^3 \\cdot (1 + 0.3)^3 = 10^3 \\cdot (1 + 3 \\cdot 0.3 + 3 \\cdot (0.3)^2 + (0.3)^3)$\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n$= 10^3 \\cdot (1 + 0.9 + 0.27 + 0.027)$\n\n$= 10^3 \\cdot 2.157$\n\n$= 10^3 \\cdot 2.16$ (we'll use this approximation to get an upper bound)\n\n$= 2160$\n\nNow, we need to find the greatest integer less than $2160$. Since $2160$ is already an integer, the greatest integer less than $2160$ is $2159$.\n\n**Step 4: Verify our answer and express it in the required format**\n\nWe have found that the greatest integer less than $10.3^3$ is $2159$."
