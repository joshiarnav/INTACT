    "problem": "How many numbers between 1 and 2005 are integer multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12?",
    "solution": "Since $\\frac{2005}{3} = 668\\frac13$, there are 668 multiples of 3 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\\frac{2005}{4} = 501\\frac14$, there are 501 multiples of 4 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\\frac{2005}{12} = 167\\frac{1}{12}$, there are 167 multiples of 12 between 1 and 2005.\n\nEvery multiple of 12 is also a multiple of 3 and of 4, so there are $668-167 = 501$ multiples of 3 that are not multiples of 12 and $501-167 = 334$ multiples of 4 that are not multiples of 12.  That leaves $501 + 334 = \\boxed{835}$ numbers that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12.  (Note: no number can be a multiple of 3 and 4 without also being a multiple of 12.  So, no number is included twice in our count $501+334$.)",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of multiples of 3 between 1 and 2005.\nTo find the number of multiples of 3 between 1 and 2005, we divide 2005 by 3 and take the floor of the result, which gives us the count of multiples of 3 that are less than or equal to 2005.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of multiples of 4 between 1 and 2005.\nSimilarly, to find the number of multiples of 4 between 1 and 2005, we divide 2005 by 4 and take the floor of the result to get the count of multiples of 4 that are less than or equal to 2005.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of multiples of 12 between 1 and 2005.\nTo find the number of multiples of 12 between 1 and 2005, we divide 2005 by 12 and take the floor of the result to get the count of multiples of 12 that are less than or equal to 2005.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of multiples of 3 or 4 between 1 and 2005 without considering the multiples of 12.\nWe add the counts of multiples of 3 and multiples of 4 from steps 1 and 2, but because we counted multiples of 12 twice (once as a multiple of 3 and once as a multiple of 4), we need to subtract the count of multiples of 12 once to correct for the double counting.\n\n## Step 5: Subtract the count of multiples of 12 from the total count of multiples of 3 or 4 to get the final count.\nTo get the final count of numbers that are integer multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12, we subtract the count of multiples of 12 from the total count calculated in step 4.\n\n## Step 6: Perform calculations from previous steps.\nApplying the floor function and calculations:\n- The number of multiples of 3 = floor(2005/3) = 669.\n- The number of multiples of 4 = floor(2005/4) = 501.\n- The number of multiples of 12 = floor(2005/12) = 167.\n- The number of multiples of 3 or 4 = (669 + 501) - 167 = 1003.\n- The final count = 1003.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1003}$"
