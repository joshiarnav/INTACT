    "problem": "Ben rolls two fair six-sided dice. What is the expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled? Express your answer as a fraction.  (If the two numbers are the same, we take that number to be the \"larger\" number.)",
    "solution": "There are 36 possible outcomes for the two dice. Of these, there is 1 where both dice roll a six, 5 where the first die rolls a six and the other rolls something less than a six, and 5 more where the second die rolls a six and the first die rolls something less than a six. So, there are a total of $1+5+5=11$ ways the larger number rolled can be a six. Similarly, there are $1+4+4=9$ ways the larger number rolled can be a five, $1+3+3=7$ ways the larger number rolled can be a four, $1+2+2=5$ ways the larger number rolled can be a three, $1+1+1=3$ ways the larger number rolled can be a two, and $1$ way the larger number rolled can be a one. The expected value of the larger number is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{36}(11(6)+9(5)&+7(4)+5(3)+3(2)+1(1))\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{36}(66+45+28+15+6+1)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{161}{36}}\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Step 1 description\nTo find the expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled, we need to consider the possible outcomes when rolling two fair six-sided dice. Each die has six sides, so the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n## Step 2: Step 2 description\nWe want to find the expected value of the larger number rolled. This means we are interested in the sum of the products of each possible value and its probability. Since the two dice are independent, the probability of rolling a certain number on one die does not affect the probability of rolling a certain number on the other die. Each number on each die has a $\\frac{1}{6}$ probability of being rolled.\n\n## Step 3: Step 3 description\nWe need to consider the pairs of numbers that can be rolled and identify the larger number in each pair. For each possible number from 1 to 6, we calculate the probability that it will be the larger number when rolling two dice.\n\n## Step 4: Step 4 description\nLet's consider each case separately:\n- When one die shows a 1, the other die can show any number from 2 to 6.\n- When one die shows a 2, the other die can show any number from 2 to 6, except 1, which we already counted in the previous case.\n- We continue this process until we consider the case when one die shows a 6, and the other die can show any number from 6 to 6.\n\n## Step 5: Step 5 description\nFor each number $k$ from 1 to 6, the probability that the larger number rolled is $k$ is equal to the probability of rolling a $k$ or higher on one die times the probability of rolling $k-1$ or lower on the other die. This is calculated as $\\frac{6-k+1}{6}\\times\\frac{k}{6}$.\n\n## Step 6: Step 6 description\nThe expected value of the larger number rolled is the sum of the products of each possible value and its probability. We can calculate this by summing the products of each possible value and its probability.\n\n## Step 7: Step 7 description\nWe can calculate the expected value using the formula: $\\sum_{k=1}^{6} k \\times P(k)$. Here, $P(k)$ is the probability that the larger number rolled is $k$.\n\n## Step 8: Step 8 description\nTo find the probability $P(k)$, we use the expression $\\frac{6-k+1}{6}\\times\\frac{k}{6}$ from step 5.\n\n## Step 9: Step 9 description\nSubstitute $P(k)$ into the formula for the expected value: $\\sum_{k=1}^{6} k \\times \\frac{(6-k+1)}{36} \\times \\frac{k}{6}$.\n\n## Step 10: Step 10 description\nSimplify the expression for the expected value by calculating the sum.\n\n## Step 11: Step 11 description\nSimplify the expression further to get the final result for the expected value of the larger number rolled.\n\n## Step 12: Step 12 description\n$E=\\frac{1}{36}\\sum_{k=1}^{6} k(7-k)=\\frac{1}{36}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{6} 7k-\\sum_{k=1}^{6} k^2\\right)=\\frac{1}{36}\\left(7\\sum_{k=1}^{6}k-\\sum_{k=1}^{6}k^2\\right)$\n\n## Step 13: Step 13 description\n$\\sum_{k=1}^{6}k=1+2+3+4+5+6=21$, and $\\sum_{k=1}^{6}k^2=1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2+5^2+6^2=91$.\n\n## Step 14: Step 14 description\nNow substitute the values of $\\sum_{k=1}^{6}k$ and $\\sum_{k=1}^{6}k^2$ into the expression for the expected value.\n\n## Step 15: Step 15 description\n$E=\\frac{1}{36}\\left(7(21)-91\\right)=\\frac{1}{36}(147-91)$\n\n## Step 16: Step 16 description\nSimplify the expression further to get the final result for the expected value of the larger number rolled.\n\n## Step 17: Step 17 description\n$E=\\frac{1}{36}(56)=\\frac{56}{36}$\n\n## Step 18: Step 18 description\nReduce the fraction $\\frac{56}{36}$ to its lowest terms.\n\n## Step 19: Step 19 description\n$\\frac{56}{36}=\\frac{14}{9}$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{14}{9}}$"
