    "problem": "If Michael rolls three fair dice, what is the probability that he will roll at least two 1's? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We calculate the complement, or the probability that Michael does not roll at least two 1's, and then subtract from 1.  If Michael does not roll at least two 1's, he must roll either zero or one.  The probability that he rolls no 1's is  $$\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6} = \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{216}$$The probability that he rolls one 1 is $$\\left(\\binom{3}{1}\\cdot\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\\cdot\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6} = \\binom{3}{1}\\left(\\frac{25}{216}\\right) = \\frac{75}{216},$$since we can choose which of the dice rolled a 1 in $\\binom{3}{1}$ ways.  Thus our answer is $1-\\frac{125}{216}-\\frac{75}{216} = \\frac{16}{216}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{27}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand what the problem is asking for\nWe need to find the probability that Michael rolls at least two 1's when he rolls three fair dice.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of outcomes when rolling three dice\nEach die has 6 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), and since there are 3 dice, the total number of outcomes is $6^3 = 216$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the cases that satisfy the condition of rolling at least two 1's\nThere are three cases to consider:\n- Exactly two 1's are rolled.\n- Three 1's are rolled.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to roll exactly two 1's\nThere are three ways to choose which die is not a 1. The non-1 die can be any of the 5 numbers that are not 1 (2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Therefore, the total number of ways to roll exactly two 1's is $3 \\times 5 = 15$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to roll three 1's\nThere is only one way to roll three 1's, which is when all three dice show a 1.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of ways to roll at least two 1's\nThe total number of ways to roll at least two 1's is $15 + 1 = 16$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability of rolling at least two 1's\nThe probability of rolling at least two 1's is the total number of ways to roll at least two 1's divided by the total number of outcomes, which is $\\frac{16}{216}$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the fraction\nThe fraction $\\frac{16}{216}$ can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 16, resulting in $\\frac{1}{216} \\times \\frac{1}{1}$, no, we simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 16, resulting in $\\frac{1}{16} \\times \\frac{1}{\\frac{216}{16}}$ which equals $\\frac{1}{16} \\times \\frac{1}{\\frac{27}{1}}$ which equals $\\frac{1}{16} \\times \\frac{1}{27}$. $\\frac{1}{16} \\times \\frac{1}{27}$ can be multiplied as $\\frac{1 \\times 1}{16 \\times 27}$ which equals $\\frac{1}{432}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{432}}$"
