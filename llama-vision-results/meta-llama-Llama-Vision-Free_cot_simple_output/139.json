    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the constraints and the possible movements allowed in the grid.\n## Step 2:  We are only allowed to move either up or to the right from any given point on the grid.\n## Step 3:  We want to find the number of paths from point $A$ to point $B$, which means we need to determine the number of ways we can reach $B$ by taking the allowed steps.\n## Step 4:  Looking at the grid, we can see that the only way to reach $B$ from $A$ is by taking three steps to the right and two steps up.\n## Step 5:  This is a classic combinatorics problem where we need to find the number of ways to arrange these steps in a sequence.\n## Step 6:  Since we have a total of five steps (three to the right and two up), we can think of this as arranging the letters $R$ (right) and $U$ (up) in a sequence of five letters.\n## Step 7:  The number of ways to arrange these letters can be found using combinations, as we need to choose the positions for the two $U$ letters (or equivalently, the three $R$ letters) out of the five available positions.\n## Step 8:  This can be calculated using the formula for combinations, which is $\\dbinom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $r$ is the number of items to choose.\n## Step 9:  In our case, we have five steps in total, and we want to choose two of them to be up, so the number of paths is given by $\\dbinom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{10}$ paths from $A$ to $B$ on the grid.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
