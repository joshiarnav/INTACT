    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are distinguishable and the boxes are distinguishable?",
    "solution": "There are 3 different boxes, so each of the 5 balls can be placed in three different locations.  So the answer is $3^5 = \\boxed{243}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We need to determine the number of ways to distribute 5 distinguishable balls into 3 distinguishable boxes.\n## Step 2:  Since each ball can be placed in any of the 3 boxes and the order of the boxes matters, we essentially have 3 choices for each ball.\n## Step 3:  We can approach this by considering each ball individually and calculating the number of choices for each one.\n## Step 4:  For the first ball, there are 3 choices of boxes where it can be placed.\n## Step 5:  Similarly, for the second ball, there are again 3 choices of boxes, and this pattern continues for the remaining 3 balls.\n## Step 6:  So, to find the total number of ways to put the 5 balls in the 3 boxes, we multiply the number of choices for each ball together.\n## Step 7:  This gives us a total of $3^5$ ways to distribute the 5 distinguishable balls into the 3 distinguishable boxes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{243}$"
