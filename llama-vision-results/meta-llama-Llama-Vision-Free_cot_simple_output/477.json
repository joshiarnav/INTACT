    "problem": "In how many ways can 8 people sit around a round table if Pierre and Thomas want to sit together, but Rosa doesn't want to sit next to either of them? (Treat rotations as not distinct but reflections as distinct.)",
    "solution": "Solution 1: We choose any seat for Pierre, and then seat everyone else relative to Pierre.  There are 2 choices for Thomas; to the right or left of Pierre.  Then, there are 4 possible seats for Rosa that aren't adjacent to Pierre or Thomas. The five remaining people can be arranged in any of $5!$ ways, so there are a total of $2\\cdot 4\\cdot 5!=960$ valid ways to arrange the people around the table.\n\nSolution 2: The total number of ways in which Pierre and Thomas sit together is $6! \\cdot 2 = 1440$. The number of ways in which Pierre and Thomas sit together and Rosa sits next to one of them is $5! \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 480$. So the answer is the difference $1440 - 480 = \\boxed{960}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Consider the constraint that Pierre and Thomas must sit together.\nPierre and Thomas can be treated as a single unit, reducing the number of people to place at the table to 7 (the 6 other people plus the Pierre-Thomas unit).\n\n## Step 2:  Consider Rosa's constraint that she cannot sit next to Pierre or Thomas.\nGiven the constraint that Rosa cannot sit next to Pierre or Thomas, there are only two possible positions for Rosa: at the table directly across from the Pierre-Thomas unit or directly across from one of the two spots between the Pierre-Thomas unit and the two adjacent people.\n\n## Step 3:  Calculate the number of ways to arrange the 7 units (6 people plus the Pierre-Thomas unit) around the round table.\nThere are (7-1)! = 6! ways to arrange the 7 units around the round table.\n\n## Step 4:  Calculate the number of ways to arrange the individuals within the 7 units.\nOnce the units are arranged, there are 2 ways to arrange Pierre and Thomas within their unit.\n\n## Step 5:  Calculate the number of ways to arrange the people in the remaining 5 units.\nThere are 5! ways to arrange the remaining 5 people around the table.\n\n## Step 6:  Apply the constraint that Rosa cannot sit next to Pierre or Thomas.\nWe have two possible arrangements for Rosa: she can sit directly across from the Pierre-Thomas unit, and she can sit directly across from one of the two spots between the Pierre-Thomas unit and the two adjacent people.\n\n## Step 7:  Calculate the number of arrangements where Rosa is directly across from the Pierre-Thomas unit.\nFor Rosa to be directly across from the Pierre-Thomas unit, there are 2 spots where she can sit, and the 6 other people can be arranged around the table in (5!)(2) ways.\n\n## Step 8:  Calculate the number of arrangements where Rosa is directly across from one of the two spots between the Pierre-Thomas unit and the two adjacent people.\nFor Rosa to be directly across from one of the two spots between the Pierre-Thomas unit and the two adjacent people, there are 4 spots where she can sit, and the 6 other people can be arranged around the table in (5!)(4) ways.\n\n## Step 9:  Combine the results from steps 7 and 8.\nWe can combine the results from steps 7 and 8 to get the total number of arrangements where Rosa is not next to Pierre or Thomas.\n\n## Step 10:  Calculate the total number of arrangements.\nTotal number of arrangements = [(5!)(2) + (5!)(4)](2)(6!).\n\n## Step 11:  Simplify the expression.\nTotal number of arrangements = [2(5!)](2)(6!).\n\n## Step 12:  Evaluate the expression.\nTotal number of arrangements = (2)(2)(5!)(6!).\nTotal number of arrangements = (4)(5!)(6!).\n\n## Step 13:  Calculate the value of the expression.\n(4)(5!)(6!) = (4)(5*4*3*2*1)(6*5*4*3*2*1).\n\n## Step 14:  Perform the multiplication.\n(4)(5*4*3*2*1)(6*5*4*3*2*1) = (4)(120)(720).\n\n## Step 15:  Simplify the expression.\n(4)(120)(720) = 120*2880.\n\n## Step 16:  Perform the multiplication.\n120*2880 = 345600.\n\n## Step 17:  Divide the result by 2 to account for the fact that reflections are distinct.\nWe must divide the result by 2, because reflections are distinct.\n\n## Step 18:  Calculate the final result.\nFinal result = 345600 / 2 = 172800.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{172800}$"
