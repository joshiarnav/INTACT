    "problem": "During the school year, the 10 members of the chess club play a total of 900 games of chess during their practice matches. Each member plays against every other member $N$ times. What is the value of $N$?",
    "solution": "Since there are 10 club members, there are $\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10\\cdot 9}{2} = 45$ pairings of members.  Thus, each pair must have played $\\frac{900}{45} = \\boxed{20}$ games.",

    "file_name": "./MATH/test/counting_and_probability/498.json",
    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of games played by all members\nEach game involves two members, so for every game, we are counting it twice when we count each member's participation. Since there are 10 members, if each member played against every other member once, the total number of games would be 10 choose 2, which is (10 * 9) / 2 = 45.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of games played\nWe know the total number of games played is 900.\n\n## Step 3: Find the ratio of the total number of games played to the total number of games played by all members\nTo determine how many times each member played against every other member, we divide the total number of games played (900) by the total number of games played by all members (45) to find the value of $N$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate N\nN = 900 / 45 = 20.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$"
