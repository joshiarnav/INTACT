    "problem": "A cook has 10 red peppers and 5 green peppers. If the cook selects 6 peppers at random, what is the probability that he selects at least 4 green peppers? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We can count the number of ways to choose a group of 4 green and 2 red peppers and the number of ways to choose 5 green and 1 red peppers. These are $\\binom{5}{4}\\binom{10}{2}=5\\cdot45=225$ and $\\binom{5}{5}\\binom{10}{1}=10$. The total number of ways the cook can choose peppers is $\\binom{15}{6}=5005$. Therefore, the probability that out of six randomly chosen peppers at least four will be green is $\\frac{235}{5005}=\\boxed{\\frac{47}{1001}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of ways the cook can select 6 peppers out of 15 (10 red and 5 green).\n## Step 2:  The total number of ways to choose 6 peppers out of 15 can be calculated using combinations. This can be expressed as C(15,6), which is calculated as 15! / (6!*(15-6)!).\n## Step 3:  To find the number of ways to select at least 4 green peppers, we'll calculate the number of ways for each scenario (4 green and 2 red, 5 green and 1 red, 6 green) and then sum them up.\n## Step 4:  First, let's calculate the number of ways to choose 4 green peppers and 2 red peppers. This can be expressed as C(5,4) * C(10,2).\n## Step 5:  Second, let's calculate the number of ways to choose 5 green peppers and 1 red pepper. This can be expressed as C(5,5) * C(10,1).\n## Step 6:  Finally, let's calculate the number of ways to choose 6 green peppers. This can be expressed as C(5,6).\n## Step 7:  After calculating each of these, we'll sum them up to find the total number of ways to select at least 4 green peppers.\n## Step 8:  The probability of selecting at least 4 green peppers will then be the total number of ways to select at least 4 green peppers divided by the total number of ways to choose 6 peppers out of 15.\n\n## Step 9:  Now, let's calculate the combinations:\n## Step 10:  Total number of ways to choose 6 peppers out of 15: C(15,6) = 15! / (6!*(15-6)!) = 5005.\n## Step 11:  Number of ways to choose 4 green peppers and 2 red peppers: C(5,4) * C(10,2) = 5 * 45 = 225.\n## Step 12:  Number of ways to choose 5 green peppers and 1 red pepper: C(5,5) * C(10,1) = 1 * 10 = 10.\n## Step 13:  Number of ways to choose 6 green peppers: C(5,6) = 0 (this is impossible since we can't choose 6 out of 5 peppers).\n## Step 14:  Total number of ways to select at least 4 green peppers: 225 + 10 + 0 = 235.\n\n## Step 15:  Now, let's calculate the probability:\n## Step 16:  Probability of selecting at least 4 green peppers = Total number of ways to select at least 4 green peppers / Total number of ways to choose 6 peppers out of 15 = 235 / 5005.\n\n## Step 17:  To simplify the fraction, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 235 and 5005.\n\n## Step 18:  The GCD of 235 and 5005 is 5.\n\n## Step 19:  Now, let's simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD.\n\n## Step 20:  Simplified probability = 235 / 5 / 5005 / 5 = 47 / 1001.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{47}{1001}}$"
