    "problem": "How many numbers between 100 and 200 (inclusive) are not perfect squares?",
    "solution": "There are $200-100+1 = 101$ numbers in the list $100, 101, \\ldots, 200$.  We can find 5 perfect squares in the list, namely $10^2,\\ldots,14^2$.  So the number of non-perfect-squares in the list is $101-5=\\boxed{96}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the count of numbers between 100 and 200 (inclusive) that are not perfect squares, we need to first identify the perfect squares within the given range. The smallest perfect square greater than or equal to 100 is 121, which is \\(11^2\\), and the largest perfect square less than or equal to 200 is 196, which is \\(14^2\\).\n## Step 2:  The next step is to determine the total count of perfect squares within this range. Since 121 is the square of 11 and 196 is the square of 14, we have a sequence of perfect squares: \\(11^2, 12^2, \\ldots, 14^2\\).\n## Step 3:  We need to find how many numbers are in this sequence. Since the sequence starts at 11 and ends at 14, it includes 4 numbers.\n## Step 4:  The total numbers between 100 and 200, inclusive, is 200 - 100 + 1 = 101.\n## Step 5:  To find the count of numbers that are not perfect squares, we subtract the count of perfect squares from the total numbers. So, the count of numbers that are not perfect squares = Total numbers - Count of perfect squares.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{97}$"
