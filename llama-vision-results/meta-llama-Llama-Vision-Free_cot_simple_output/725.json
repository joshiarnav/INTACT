    "solution": "In general, \\[(a+b)^3=a^3+3a^2b+3ab^2+b^3\\]\n\nConsider the decimal part separately, so we're trying to find the greatest integer less than $(10+0.3)^3$. By the Binomial Theorem in the above expansion, this is equal to  \\[10^3+3(10^2)(.3)+3(10)(.3^2)+.3^3\\] Expanding these terms, we have that $(10.3)^3=1000+90+2.7+.027$. From this, we find that the greatest integer less than this quantity is $\\boxed{1092}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Let's break down the problem step by step. We want to find the greatest integer less than $10.3^3$, so the first step is to calculate the value of $10.3^3$.\n## Step 2:  We know that $10.3$ is $10 + 0.3$, and $0.3$ can be thought of as $3/10$.\n## Step 3:  We also know that $10^3 = 1000$.\n## Step 4:  Now, we can use the cube of a binomial formula to expand $(10 + 0.3)^3$. The formula tells us that $(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$.\n## Step 5:  Substituting $10$ for $a$ and $0.3$ for $b$, we get: $(10 + 0.3)^3 = 10^3 + 3 \\cdot 10^2 \\cdot 0.3 + 3 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 0.3^2 + 0.3^3$\n## Step 6:  Simplifying the expression, we get: $(10 + 0.3)^3 = 1000 + 90 + 2.7 + 0.027$\n## Step 7:  Combining the terms, we get: $(10 + 0.3)^3 = 1092.727$\n## Step 8:  Now that we have the value of $(10 + 0.3)^3$, we know that the greatest integer less than this value is the greatest integer less than $1092.727$.\n## Step 9:  To find this integer, we can simply round down the decimal part of the number, which gives us the greatest integer less than the value.\n## Step 10:  Rounding down $1092.727$, we get $1092$.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the greatest integer less than $10.3^3$ is $1092$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1092}$"
