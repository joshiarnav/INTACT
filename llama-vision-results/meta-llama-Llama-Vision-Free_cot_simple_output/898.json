    "problem": "A bag contains two red beads and two green beads. You reach into the bag and pull out a bead, replacing it with a red bead regardless of the color you pulled out.  What is the probability that all beads in the bag are red after three such replacements? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The beads will all be red at the end of the third draw precisely when two  green beads are chosen in the three draws. If the first bead drawn is  green, then there will be one  green and three red beads in the bag before the second draw. So the probability that  green beads are drawn in the first two draws is $$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}= \\frac{1}{8}.\n$$ The probability that a  green bead is chosen, then a red bead, and then a  green bead, is $$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{32}.\n$$ Finally, the probability that a red bead is chosen then two  green beads is $$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}.\n$$ The sum of these probabilities is $$\n\\frac{1}{8}+ \\frac{3}{32}+ \\frac{1}{16}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{32}}.\n$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the initial conditions and the process.\nWe start with a bag containing 2 red beads and 2 green beads. We pull out one bead and replace it with a red bead, regardless of the color pulled out.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the probability of pulling out a red bead on the first pull.\nSince there are 2 red beads out of a total of 4 beads, the probability of pulling out a red bead on the first pull is 2/4 = 1/2.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of pulling out a red bead on the second pull.\nIf a red bead is pulled out on the first pull and replaced with a red bead, there are now 3 red beads and 2 green beads, for a total of 5 beads. The probability of pulling out a red bead from this mix is 3/5.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of pulling out a red bead on the third pull.\nIf a red bead is pulled out on the second pull and replaced with a red bead, there are now 4 red beads and 2 green beads, for a total of 6 beads. The probability of pulling out a red bead from this mix is 4/6 = 2/3.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that all beads are red after three replacements.\nSince each pull is an independent event, the probability of all three pulls resulting in a red bead is the product of the probabilities of each pull: (1/2) * (3/5) * (2/3).\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression to find the final probability.\n(1/2) * (3/5) * (2/3) = 1/5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$"
