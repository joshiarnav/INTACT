    "problem": "I have two cubes such that, on each cube, three faces are painted red and three faces are painted white. If I roll each of the cubes once, what is the probability that they will land such that there is one red face and one white face up?",
    "solution": "There are four possible ways for the cubes to land: two red faces up, the first with a red face and the second with a white face up, the first with a white face and the second with a red face up, and two white faces up. So, there are two ways that the cubes can land such that there is a red face up and a white face up. The probability that we get a red face up is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, the probability that we get a white face up is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the probability that the cubes land such that there is one red face and one white face up is $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\nAlternate solution: After you roll the first cube, the second one must be the other color, which occurs with probability $\\frac{3}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of outcomes for each cube.\nEach cube has 6 faces, so when rolling one cube, there are 6 possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of outcomes for both cubes.\nSince there are two cubes, and each cube has 6 possible outcomes, the total number of outcomes for both cubes is 6 * 6 = 36.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the favorable outcomes for both cubes.\nFor each cube to land such that there is one red face and one white face up, there are 3 favorable outcomes for the red face and 3 favorable outcomes for the white face.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes for both cubes.\nSince there are 3 favorable outcomes for the red face and 3 for the white face, and these are independent events on each cube, the total number of favorable outcomes for both cubes is 3 * 3 = 9.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of both cubes landing such that there is one red face and one white face up.\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, so the probability is 9 / 36.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the fraction representing the probability.\nThe fraction 9 / 36 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9. This results in 1 / 4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$"
