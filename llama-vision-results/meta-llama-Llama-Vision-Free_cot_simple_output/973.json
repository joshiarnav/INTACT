    "problem": "January 1, 2007 was a Monday. In 2007, how many Fridays are there?",
    "solution": "There were 365 days in 2007, and since $364=7\\cdot52$, there were $52$ full weeks and $1$ more day in the year. So there were $\\boxed{52}$ Fridays.",

    "file_name": "./MATH/test/counting_and_probability/973.json",
    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of days in 2007.\n2007 is not a leap year since it is not divisible by 4. Therefore, it has 365 days.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of weeks in 2007.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of days in 2007 by 7 to find the number of weeks. 365 / 7 = 52 remainder 1.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of Fridays in 2007.\nSince 2007 is not a leap year, it has 52 complete weeks and 1 extra day. In each week, there is one Friday. Therefore, in 52 weeks, there are 52 Fridays. We also need to count the extra day. Since January 1, 2007 was a Monday, we need to count the number of Fridays from January 1st to the end of the year.\n\n## Step 4: Count the Fridays from January 1st to the end of the year.\nSince January 1st, 2007 is a Monday, we can count the Fridays: January 5th, January 12th, ..., December 28th. This is essentially counting the number of weeks and adding the first day of the year. We have 52 weeks and the first day of the year is a Monday, so we can ignore this extra day.\n\n## Step 5: Add 1 to the number of complete weeks to account for the extra day.\nSince we have 52 complete weeks and 1 extra day, we add 1 to the number of Fridays in the complete weeks to get the total number of Fridays. 52 + 1 = 53.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of Fridays in 2007.\nWe have 52 complete weeks, each with one Friday. We also have 1 extra day at the end of the year. Since January 1st, 2007 is a Monday, we count the Fridays from January 5th, January 12th, ..., December 28th. This is essentially counting the number of weeks and adding the first day of the year. We have 52 weeks and the first day of the year is a Monday, so we can ignore this extra day. We just need to count the Fridays from January 5th to December 28th.\n\n## Step 7: Count the Fridays from January 5th to December 28th.\nWe can count the Fridays: 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th, 2nd, 9th, 16th, 23rd, 30th, 6th, 13th, 20th, 27th, 3rd, 10th, 17th, 24th, 31st, 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, 4th, 11th, 18th, 25th, 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, 29th, 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th, 2nd, 9th, 16th, 23rd, 30th, 6th, 13th, 20th, 27th, 3rd, 10th, 17th, 24th, 31st, 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th. We have 52 Fridays.\n\n## Step 8: Verify the count.\nLet's count the Fridays again, but this time, let's count them from Monday to Friday: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. We have 5 days in a week. If January 1st, 2007 is a Monday, then January 5th, 2007 is a Friday. Let's count the Fridays from January 5th to December 28th. January: 5th, February: 2nd, 9th, March: 9th, 16th, 23rd, April: 6th, 13th, 20th, 27th, May: 4th, 11th, 18th, 25th, June: 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, 29th, July: 6th, 13th, 20th, 27th, August: 3rd, 10th, 17th, 24th, 31st, September: 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, October: 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th, November: 2nd, 9th, 16th, 23rd, 30th, December: 7th. We have 52 Fridays.\n\n\n\n## Step 9: Determine the final answer.\nWe have 52 weeks and 1 extra day. We can ignore the extra day because January 1st, 2007 is a Monday. We have 52 complete weeks, each with one Friday. Therefore, the total number of Fridays in 2007 is 52.\n\n\n\n## Step 10: Provide the final answer.\nWe calculated the total number of Fridays in 2007. We have 52 complete weeks and 1 extra day. We can ignore the extra day because January 1st, 2007 is a Monday. We have 52 complete weeks, each with one Friday. Therefore, the total number of Fridays in 2007 is 52.\n\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{52}$"
