    "problem": "The probability of rain tomorrow is $\\frac{1}{11}$.  What is the probability that it will not rain tomorrow?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "It must either rain tomorrow or not rain tomorrow, so the sum of the probability that it rains and the probability it doesn't rain is 1.  Therefore, the probability it doesn't rain is $1 - \\frac{1}{11} = \\boxed{\\frac{10}{11}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the probability that it will not rain tomorrow, we need to understand that the probability of an event happening and the probability of it not happening are complementary events and their probabilities add up to 1.\n## Step 2:  Given that the probability of rain tomorrow is $\\frac{1}{11}$, we know that the probability of rain is complementary to the probability of no rain.\n## Step 3:  The probability of an event not happening is calculated by subtracting the probability of the event happening from 1. In this case, it will be $1 - \\frac{1}{11}$.\n## Step 4:  Simplifying $1 - \\frac{1}{11}$ gives us $\\frac{10}{11}$.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the probability that it will not rain tomorrow is $\\frac{10}{11}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{10}{11}}$"
