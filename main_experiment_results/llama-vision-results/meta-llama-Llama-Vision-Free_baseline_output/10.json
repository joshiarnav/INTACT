    "problem": "$n$ fair 6-sided dice are simultaneously rolled. The probability that exactly two of them show a number other than 1 is $\\frac{25}{216}$. Find $n$.",
    "solution": "For $n$ dice, there are $\\binom{n}{2}=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ ways to choose two of them. For each of these ways, there is a $\\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^{n-2}$ chance that all but the chosen two dice will roll a 1. Therefore, we need to find the value of $n$ for which $\\frac{25n(n-1)}{2 \\cdot 6^n}=\\frac{25}{216}$, or $108n(n-1)=6^n$. Plugging in values for $n$, we can see that $n=\\boxed{4}$ works and no value of $n$ less than 4 works. Now we just need to prove that no values of $n$ greater than 4 work. Note that if $n \\geq 5$, then $n < 3^{n-3}$ and $n-1 < 2\\cdot 2^{n-3}$. We can multiply these inequalities to get that when $n \\geq 5$, we have $n(n-1) < 2\\cdot 6^{n-3}$, or $108n(n-1)<6^n$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem requires finding the value of $n$ when $n$ fair 6-sided dice are rolled, and the probability that exactly two of them show a number other than 1 is $\\frac{25}{216}$.\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we need to calculate the probability of the desired event for a given number of dice and then solve for $n$.\n## Step 3:  First, we need to determine the probability that a single die does not show a 1, which is $\\frac{5}{6}$. Similarly, the probability that a single die shows a 1 is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n## Step 4:  Now, we want to calculate the probability that exactly two of the $n$ dice show a number other than 1. This involves choosing 2 dice out of $n$, which can be represented as $\\binom{n}{2}$, and for each of these combinations, the probability is $\\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right) ^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right) ^{n-2}$.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the total probability for this event is given by the expression $\\binom{n}{2}\\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right) ^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right) ^{n-2}$.\n## Step 6:  We are given that this probability is equal to $\\frac{25}{216}$.\n## Step 7:  We can set up the equation $\\binom{n}{2}\\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right) ^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right) ^{n-2} = \\frac{25}{216}$ and solve for $n$.\n## Step 8:  By simplifying the expression, we get $\\binom{n}{2} \\frac{25}{6^{n}} = \\frac{25}{216}$.\n## Step 9:  We can then cancel out the common factor of $25$ from both sides to obtain $\\binom{n}{2} \\frac{1}{6^{n}} = \\frac{1}{216}$.\n## Step 10:  We can further simplify this expression by multiplying both sides by $6^n$ to obtain $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{6^n}{216}$.\n## Step 11:  By expanding the combination, we get $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \\frac{6^n}{216}$.\n## Step 12:  We then need to find the value of $n$ that satisfies this equation.\n## Step 13:  We can start by testing different values of $n$ to see if we can find a match.\n## Step 14:  Since $n$ must be a positive integer, we can start by testing small values of $n$.\n## Step 15:  We know that $n$ cannot be less than 2, because we need at least 2 dice to show a number other than 1.\n## Step 16:  We can begin by testing $n = 2, 3, 4, 5$, and so on until we find a value that satisfies the equation.\n## Step 17:  We can use trial and error to find the correct value of $n$.\n## Step 18:  We can start by substituting $n=2$ into the equation and checking if it satisfies the equation.\n## Step 19:  If $n=2$, we get $\\frac{2(2-1)}{2} = 1$ and $\\frac{6^2}{216} = \\frac{1}{36}$, which is not equal.\n## Step 20:  Next, we can substitute $n=3$ into the equation and check if it satisfies the equation.\n## Step 21:  If $n=3$, we get $\\frac{3(3-1)}{2} = 3$ and $\\frac{6^3}{216} = \\frac{1}{216}$, which is not equal.\n## Step 22:  We continue this process until we find the correct value of $n$ that satisfies the equation.\n## Step 23:  If $n=4$, we get $\\frac{4(4-1)}{2} = 6$ and $\\frac{6^4}{216} = \\frac{1}{216}$, which is equal.\n## Step 24:  Therefore, we have found the value of $n$ that satisfies the equation.\n## Step 25:  Hence, the value of $n$ is $n=4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
