    "problem": "When rolling a certain unfair six-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the probability of obtaining face $F$ is greater than $1/6$, the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is less than $1/6$, the probability of obtaining each of the other faces is $1/6$, and the sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces is 7. When two such dice are rolled, the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $ \\frac{47}{288} $. Given that the probability of obtaining face $F$ is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.",
    "solution": "Let $p(a,b)$ denote the probability of obtaining  $a$ on the first die and $b$ on the second.  Then the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $$p(1,6)+p(2,5)+p(3,4)+p(4,3)+p(5,2)+p(6,1).$$Let the probability of obtaining face $F$ be $(1/6)+x$.  Then the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is $(1/6)-x$. Therefore $$\\begin{aligned}{{47}\\over{288}}&=\n4\\left({1\\over6}\\right)^2+2\\left({1\\over6}+x\\right)\n\\left({1\\over6}-x\\right)\\cr&=\n{4\\over36}+2\\left({1\\over36}-x^2\\right)\\cr&=\n{1\\over6}-2x^2.\\end{aligned}$$Then $2x^2=1/288$, and so $x=1/24$. The probability of obtaining face $F$ is therefore $(1/6)+(1/24)=5/24$, and $m+n=\\boxed{29}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The given problem involves determining the probability of obtaining a specific face on a certain unfair six-sided die and then using this information to find the sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces.\n## Step 2:  The die has faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and we're told that the probability of obtaining face $F$ is greater than $1/6$, the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is less than $1/6$, and the probability of obtaining each of the other faces is $1/6$.\n## Step 3:  We also know that the sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces is 7.\n## Step 4:  Let's denote the faces as $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, and $F$, such that $F$ is the face with a probability greater than $1/6$ and $A$ is the face opposite $F$.\n## Step 5:  The information about the probabilities and sums of numbers on each pair of opposite faces gives us the following equations: $P(F) + P(A) = 1$, $P(D) + P(E) = 1$, $P(A) + P(D) = 1/6$, and $P(F) + P(E) = 1/6$.\n## Step 6:  After solving these equations, we find that $P(F) = \\frac{3}{8}$ and $P(A) = \\frac{5}{8}$, and $P(D) = P(E) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n## Step 7:  Now, to find the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 when two such dice are rolled, we need to consider all the possible combinations of the numbers on the two dice that add up to 7.\n## Step 8:  This includes the cases where both dice land on the same number and the cases where they land on different numbers, taking into account the probabilities of each face.\n## Step 9:  The sum of the probabilities of these cases gives us the total probability of obtaining a sum of 7, which we are told is $\\frac{47}{288}$.\n## Step 10:  We then use this information to find the probability of obtaining face $F$, which is $P(F) = \\frac{3}{8}$, and find the sum of the numbers on the pair of opposite faces.\n## Step 11:  Finally, we need to find the sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces, which turns out to be $7$.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, to find the final answer, we need to add the numerator and denominator of the probability of obtaining face $F$, which is $\\frac{3}{8}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$"
