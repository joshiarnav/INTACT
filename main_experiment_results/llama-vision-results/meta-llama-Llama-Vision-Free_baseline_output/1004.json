    "problem": "How many numbers between 1 and 2005 are integer multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12?",
    "solution": "Since $\\frac{2005}{3} = 668\\frac13$, there are 668 multiples of 3 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\\frac{2005}{4} = 501\\frac14$, there are 501 multiples of 4 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\\frac{2005}{12} = 167\\frac{1}{12}$, there are 167 multiples of 12 between 1 and 2005.\n\nEvery multiple of 12 is also a multiple of 3 and of 4, so there are $668-167 = 501$ multiples of 3 that are not multiples of 12 and $501-167 = 334$ multiples of 4 that are not multiples of 12.  That leaves $501 + 334 = \\boxed{835}$ numbers that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12.  (Note: no number can be a multiple of 3 and 4 without also being a multiple of 12.  So, no number is included twice in our count $501+334$.)",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, we need to find how many multiples of 3 there are between 1 and 2005.\nWe find the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 2005. 2005 divided by 3 is 668.333... So the largest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 2005 is 3 * 668 = 2004.\n\n## Step 2: Next, we need to find how many multiples of 4 there are between 1 and 2005.\nWe find the largest multiple of 4 that is less than or equal to 2005. 2005 divided by 4 is 501.25. So the largest multiple of 4 less than or equal to 2005 is 4 * 501 = 2004.\n\n## Step 3: We need to find how many multiples of 12 there are between 1 and 2005.\nWe find the largest multiple of 12 that is less than or equal to 2005. 2005 divided by 12 is 167.083... So the largest multiple of 12 less than or equal to 2005 is 12 * 167 = 2004.\n\n## Step 4: Next, we apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of multiples of 3 or 4.\nWe add the number of multiples of 3 and 4 and then subtract the number of multiples of 12 (since multiples of 12 are counted twice). The number of multiples of 3 or 4 is 668 + 501 - 167 = 1002.\n\n## Step 5: We must subtract the multiples of 12 from our result in step 4, since they are counted twice.\nWe already know that there are 167 multiples of 12. So we must subtract these from our previous result.\n\n## Step 6: The final step is to calculate the final answer.\n1002 - 167 = 835\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{835}$"
