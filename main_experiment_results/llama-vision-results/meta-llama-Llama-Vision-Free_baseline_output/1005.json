    "problem": "Amy's grandmother gave her 3 identical chocolate chip cookies and 4 identical sugar cookies.  In how many different orders can Amy eat the cookies such that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both?",
    "solution": "We can solve this using complementary counting by finding the number of ways Amy can eat the cookies without eating a chocolate chip cookie first or last, and subtracting that value from the total number of ways Amy can eat the cookies. Since all the chocolate cookies are identical and all the sugar cookies are identical, there are $$\\dbinom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!}=35$$total ways for Amy to eat the cookies. If Amy doesn't eat a chocolate chip cookie first or last, there are $$\\dbinom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!2!}=10$$ways for her to eat the cookies. So, there are $35-10=\\boxed{25}$ ways in which Amy can eat the cookies such that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first recognize that we need to find the total number of different orders in which Amy can eat the cookies under the given conditions.\n## Step 2:  The conditions are that she must eat a chocolate chip cookie first, she must eat a chocolate chip cookie last, or both.\n## Step 3:  The total number of cookies Amy has is 7, consisting of 3 identical chocolate chip cookies and 4 identical sugar cookies.\n## Step 4:  We can approach this problem by first finding the total number of ways Amy can eat the cookies without any restrictions and then subtracting the number of ways in which she does not eat a chocolate chip cookie first or last.\n## Step 5:  The total number of ways to eat the cookies without any restrictions is given by the combination of 7 cookies taken 7 at a time. This can be represented as $\\binom{7}{4}=35$.\n## Step 6:  Now, we need to find the cases in which Amy does not eat a chocolate chip cookie first or last. This can occur in two ways: either she eats no chocolate chip cookies first or she eats no chocolate chip cookies last.\n## Step 7:  In the first case, where she eats no chocolate chip cookies first, Amy must eat 4 sugar cookies first. This leaves 3 chocolate chip cookies and 3 sugar cookies to be eaten in any order. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{3+3-1}{3-1}=\\binom{5}{2}=10$.\n## Step 8:  In the second case, where she eats no chocolate chip cookies last, Amy must eat 4 sugar cookies last. This leaves 3 chocolate chip cookies and 3 sugar cookies to be eaten in any order. The number of ways to do this is also $\\binom{3+3-1}{3-1}=\\binom{5}{2}=10$.\n## Step 9:  Since these two cases are mutually exclusive, we can find the total number of ways Amy does not eat a chocolate chip cookie first or last by adding the number of ways in each case, which is $10+10=20$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the number of ways in which Amy can eat the cookies such that she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both is given by the total number of ways minus the cases where she does not eat a chocolate chip cookie first or last, which is $35-20=\\boxed{15}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
