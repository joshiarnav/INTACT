    "problem": "Pat is to select six cookies from a tray containing only chocolate chip, oatmeal, and peanut butter cookies. There are at least six of each of these three kinds of cookies on the tray. How many different assortments of six cookies can be selected? (Note that cookies of the same type are not distinguishable.)",
    "solution": "The numbers of the three types of cookies must have a sum of six. Possible sets of whole numbers whose sum is six are \\[\n0,0,6;\\ 0,1,5;\\ 0,2,4;\\ 0,3,3;\\ 1,1,4;\\ 1,2,3;\\ \\ \\text{and}\\ 2,2,2.\n\\]Every ordering of each of these sets determines a different assortment of cookies. There are 3 orders for each of the sets \\[\n0,0,6;\\ 0,3,3;\\ \\text{and}\\ 1,1,4.\n\\]There are 6 orders for each of the sets \\[\n0,1,5;\\ 0,2,4;\\ \\text{and}\\ 1,2,3.\n\\]There is only one order for $2,2,2$. Therefore the total number of assortments of six cookies is $3\\cdot 3 + 3\\cdot 6 + 1 = \\boxed{28}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are tasked with finding the number of different assortments of six cookies that can be selected from a tray containing only chocolate chip, oatmeal, and peanut butter cookies.\n## Step 2:  Since there are at least six of each of these three kinds of cookies on the tray, we can start by considering the different combinations of cookies that can be selected.\n## Step 3:  We can start with the scenario where all six cookies are of the same kind. There are three ways to choose the type of cookie: all chocolate chip, all oatmeal, or all peanut butter.\n## Step 4:  Moving on to the case where five cookies are of one kind and one cookie is of another kind, there are three ways to choose the type of the five cookies and then two ways to choose the type of the remaining cookie.\n## Step 5:  For the case where four cookies are of one kind and two are of another, there are three ways to choose the type of the four cookies and then three ways to choose the type of the remaining two cookies. However, since the two cookies of the same type are indistinguishable, we need to divide by 2 to avoid overcounting.\n## Step 6:  Similarly, for the case where four cookies are of one kind and one each of the other two kinds, there are three ways to choose the type of the four cookies and then two ways to choose the types of the remaining two cookies.\n## Step 7:  Lastly, for the case where three cookies are of one kind and one each of the other two kinds, there are three ways to choose the type of the three cookies.\n## Step 8:  To find the total number of different assortments, we need to sum up the number of ways for each case.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the total number of different assortments of six cookies that can be selected is $3 + 3 \\times 2 + \\frac{3 \\times 3}{2} + 3 \\times 2 + 3 = 16$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$"
