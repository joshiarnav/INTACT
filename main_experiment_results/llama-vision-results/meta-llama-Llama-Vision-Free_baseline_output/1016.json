    "problem": "Three-fourths of the students in Mr. Shearer's class have brown hair and six-sevenths of his students are right-handed.  If Mr. Shearer's class has 28 students, what is the smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair?",
    "solution": "Mr. Shearer has $\\frac{3}{4}(28)=21$ students with brown hair and $\\frac{6}{7}(28)=24$ students who are right-handed.  Since there are $28-24=4$ left-handed students, at most 4 of the 21 brown-haired students are left-handed.  Therefore, at least $\\boxed{17}$ of them are right-handed.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information, which states that three-fourths of the students in Mr. Shearer's class have brown hair and six-sevenths of his students are right-handed.\n## Step 2:  We are also told that there are 28 students in the class. We need to find the smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair.\n## Step 3:  Let's start by calculating the number of students with brown hair and the number of students who are right-handed. For brown hair, we have $\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot 28=21$ students, and for being right-handed, we have $\\frac{6}{7}\\cdot 28=24$ students.\n## Step 4:  Now, we want to find the smallest number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair. To do this, we need to find the overlap between the two groups.\n## Step 5:  We know that the total number of students in the class is 28, and this is the sum of the number of students with brown hair and the number of students who are right-handed, minus the number of students who are both right-handed and have brown hair.\n## Step 6:  We can express this as the equation $28=21+24- x$, where $x$ represents the number of students who are both right-handed and have brown hair.\n## Step 7:  Solving for $x$, we get $x=21+24-28=17$. However, this is the maximum number of students who are both right-handed and have brown hair.\n## Step 8:  To find the smallest possible number of students who are both right-handed and have brown hair, we can consider the fact that the number of students who are right-handed and have brown hair must be a multiple of both $\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot 28$ and $\\frac{6}{7}\\cdot 28$.\n## Step 9:  Since 21 students have brown hair and 24 students are right-handed, the smallest possible overlap between these two groups will be the least common multiple (LCM) of 21 and 24.\n## Step 10:  The prime factorization of 21 is $3\\cdot 7$, and the prime factorization of 24 is $2^3\\cdot 3$. To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either factorization.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the LCM of 21 and 24 is $2^3\\cdot 3\\cdot 7=84$. However, we need to remember that there are only 28 students in the class, so the actual number of students who are both right-handed and have brown hair cannot be greater than 28.\n## Step 12:  The smallest possible number of students who are both right-handed and have brown hair is therefore $\\frac{21\\cdot 6}{7} = 18$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$"
