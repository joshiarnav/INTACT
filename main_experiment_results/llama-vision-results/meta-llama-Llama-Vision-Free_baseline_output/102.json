    "problem": "How many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3?",
    "solution": "We list out all the positive integers less than 100 with a units digit of 3:  3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93.  Of these, only 33, 63, and 93 are not prime.  Thus our answer is $\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3, we need to first list all numbers less than 100 that end in 3.\nThese numbers are 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, and 93.\n\n## Step 2: Next, we need to check if each of these numbers is a prime number.\nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n## Step 3: Checking 3, it is a prime number as it cannot be divided evenly by any other number except for 1 and itself.\nChecking 13, it is a prime number.\nChecking 23, it is a prime number.\nChecking 33, it is not a prime number because it can be divided by 3 and 11.\nChecking 43, it is a prime number.\nChecking 53, it is a prime number.\nChecking 63, it is not a prime number because it can be divided by 3 and 21.\nChecking 73, it is a prime number.\nChecking 83, it is a prime number.\nChecking 93, it is not a prime number because it can be divided by 3 and 31.\n\n## Step 4: From the above, we can see that the prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 are 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83.\n\n## Step 5: Count the number of prime numbers that meet the criteria to find the total count.\nThere are 7 prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
