    "problem": "A Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans.  In how many distinguishable ways can they sit around a circular table if all the members of each party all sit next to each other?  (If the table is rotated, it should be counted as the same seating.)",
    "solution": "Choose any 5 consecutive seats in which to place the Democrats -- it doesn't matter which 5 consecutive seats that we choose, since we can rotate the table.  Then there are $5!$ ways to place the Democrats in their seats, and $5!$ ways to place the Republicans in their seats, for a total of $5! \\times 5! = \\boxed{14,\\!400}$ arrangements.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to arrange the Democrats and Republicans as two groups around the circular table.\nThere are two possible arrangements of the groups: DRDRDRDRD or RDRDRDRDR, where D represents a Democrat and R represents a Republican.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the Democrats within their group.\nSince there are 5 Democrats and they are sitting in a circular arrangement, we can fix one Democrat's position to avoid counting rotations as different arrangements. Then, there are 4! ways to arrange the remaining Democrats.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the Republicans within their group.\nSimilarly, since there are 5 Republicans and they are sitting in a circular arrangement, we can also fix one Republican's position. Then, there are 4! ways to arrange the remaining Republicans.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of distinguishable ways to seat the committee members around the circular table.\nWe multiply the number of ways to arrange the groups by the number of ways to arrange the Democrats by the number of ways to arrange the Republicans: 2 * 4! * 4!.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression to get the total number of distinguishable ways to seat the committee members around the circular table.\n2 * 4! * 4! = 2 * 24 * 24 = 2 * 576 = 1152.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1152}$"
