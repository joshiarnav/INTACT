    "problem": "The digits 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 will be put in random order to make a positive five-digit integer. What is the probability that the resulting integer will be divisible by 11? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "If the resulting integer is divisible by 11 then the sum of the first, third, and fifth digits has the same remainder when divided by 11 as the sum of the second and fourth digits. This only occurs when the first, third, and fifth digits are 2, 3, and 7 (in some order) and the second and fourth digits are 4 and 8 (in some order).\n\nThere are $\\binom{5}{2}$ total ways to partition these five digits into a group of 3 and a group of 2. From above, only one of these partitions will result in five-digit integers that are divisible by 11. Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of possible arrangements of the digits 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 to form a five-digit integer.\n## Step 2:  We know that there are 5 different digits, so the first position can be filled in 5 different ways, the second position in 4 different ways, the third in 3 different ways, the fourth in 2 different ways, and the fifth in 1 different way.\n## Step 3:  This gives a total of $5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$ possible arrangements of the digits.\n## Step 4:  Next, we need to find the number of arrangements that result in a five-digit integer divisible by 11.\n## Step 5:  We can use the divisibility rule for 11, which states that the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions (units, hundreds, ten-thousands) and the sum of the digits in the even positions (tens, thousands) must be a multiple of 11 for the number to be divisible by 11.\n## Step 6:  By using this rule, we find that the alternating sum of the 5 given digits is $2 - 3 + 4 - 7 + 8 = 4$, which is not divisible by 11.\n## Step 7:  However, we can find the number of arrangements that result in a sum of 4 or -4 by considering all possible combinations of 5 digits.\n## Step 8:  We can calculate this by considering the 10 possible arrangements for the value of 4 and the 10 possible arrangements for the value of -4.\n## Step 9:  However, since we are looking for arrangements that result in a sum of 4, we will only consider the 10 possible arrangements that give a sum of 4.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the number of arrangements that result in a sum of 4 is 10.\n## Step 11:  Thus, the probability that the resulting integer will be divisible by 11 is $\\frac{10}{120} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$"
