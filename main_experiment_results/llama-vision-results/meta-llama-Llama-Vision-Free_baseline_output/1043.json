    "problem": "For how many three-element sets (order doesn't matter) of positive integers $\\{a,b,c\\}$ is it true that $a\\times b\\times c=2310$?  (The positive integers $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are distinct.)",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $2310$ is $2310 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11.$ Therefore, we have the equation \\[ abc = 2310 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11,\\]where $a, b, c$ must be distinct positive integers and order does not matter. There are $3$ ways to assign each prime number on the right-hand side to one of the variables $a, b, c,$ which gives $3^5 = 243$ solutions for $(a, b, c).$ However, three of these solutions have two $1$s and one $2310,$ which contradicts the fact that $a, b, c$ must be distinct. Because each prime factor appears only once, all other solutions have $a, b, c$ distinct. Correcting for this, we get $243 - 3 = 240$ ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ where $a, b, c$ are all distinct.\n\nFinally, since order does not matter, we must divide by $3!,$ the number of ways to order $a, b, c.$ This gives the final answer, \\[\\frac{240}{3!} = \\frac{240}{6} = \\boxed{40}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Factorize 2310 into its prime factors\nWe start by factorizing 2310 into its prime factors. The prime factorization of 2310 is $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 11$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of distinct factors of 2310\nWe can find the number of distinct factors of 2310 by looking at its prime factorization. Since the prime factorization of 2310 contains 5 different prime factors, and their respective exponents are all 1, the number of distinct factors of 2310 is given by $(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 2^5 = 32$.\n\n## Step 3: Divide the number of distinct factors by 3\nSince we are looking for three-element sets, we need to divide the number of distinct factors by 3, because every set of three distinct factors can be rearranged in 3! = 6 ways. Therefore, the number of distinct sets of three-element sets is 32/3, but since we cannot have a fraction of a set, we must round down to the nearest whole number.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final number of sets\nHowever, when dividing by 3, we need to consider that it's not possible to have a set containing 3 factors of the same prime. Therefore, we must consider the sets that can be formed using the prime factors of 2310, which are $2^{1}$, $3^{1}$, $5^{1}$, $7^{1}$, and $11^{1}$. Now, we have to count the number of combinations of three distinct prime factors that can be used to form the set.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of combinations using the stars and bars method\nWe can use the stars and bars method to calculate the number of combinations. We have 5 different prime factors, and we need to choose 3 of them to form the set. The number of ways to choose 3 stars out of 5 is given by the combination formula $\\binom{5}{3}$. This is equal to $\\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \\frac{5!}{3!2!}$, which is equal to $10$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final number of sets for each combination\nFor each combination of 3 distinct prime factors, we can form different sets of three-element sets by distributing the remaining two prime factors among the three elements of the set. Since the order doesn't matter, we can use the stars and bars method to calculate the number of ways to distribute the remaining two prime factors among the three elements of the set. This is given by the combination formula $\\binom{2+3-1}{2}$, which is equal to $\\binom{4}{2}$. This is equal to $\\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!}$, which is equal to 6.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the final number of sets for each combination\nHowever, in this case, the remaining two prime factors can only be distributed in one way, since the order doesn't matter. Therefore, the number of sets for each combination is 1.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the final number of sets\nThe total number of sets is the product of the number of combinations and the number of sets for each combination, which is 10 * 1 = 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
