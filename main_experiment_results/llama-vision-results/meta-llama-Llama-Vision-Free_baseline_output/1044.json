    "problem": "Ben rolls two fair six-sided dice. What is the expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled? Express your answer as a fraction.  (If the two numbers are the same, we take that number to be the \"larger\" number.)",
    "solution": "There are 36 possible outcomes for the two dice. Of these, there is 1 where both dice roll a six, 5 where the first die rolls a six and the other rolls something less than a six, and 5 more where the second die rolls a six and the first die rolls something less than a six. So, there are a total of $1+5+5=11$ ways the larger number rolled can be a six. Similarly, there are $1+4+4=9$ ways the larger number rolled can be a five, $1+3+3=7$ ways the larger number rolled can be a four, $1+2+2=5$ ways the larger number rolled can be a three, $1+1+1=3$ ways the larger number rolled can be a two, and $1$ way the larger number rolled can be a one. The expected value of the larger number is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{36}(11(6)+9(5)&+7(4)+5(3)+3(2)+1(1))\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{36}(66+45+28+15+6+1)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{161}{36}}\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the possible outcomes when rolling two six-sided dice\nWhen rolling two six-sided dice, there are 36 possible outcomes. These range from (1,1) to (6,6), with each outcome being equally likely.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling a 2 as the larger number\nTo roll a 2 as the larger number, one of the following scenarios must occur: (1,2), (2,1), or (2,2). There are 3 scenarios where 2 is the larger number out of the 36 total possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of rolling a 3 as the larger number\nTo roll a 3 as the larger number, one of the following scenarios must occur: (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), or (3,2), or (3,3). There are 5 scenarios where 3 is the larger number out of the 36 total possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of rolling a 4 as the larger number\nTo roll a 4 as the larger number, one of the following scenarios must occur: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), or (4,3), or (4,4). There are 7 scenarios where 4 is the larger number out of the 36 total possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of rolling a 5 as the larger number\nTo roll a 5 as the larger number, one of the following scenarios must occur: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), or (5,4), or (5,5). There are 9 scenarios where 5 is the larger number out of the 36 total possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of rolling a 6 as the larger number\nTo roll a 6 as the larger number, one of the following scenarios must occur: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), or (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), or (6,6). There are 11 scenarios where 6 is the larger number out of the 36 total possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the expected value of the larger number\nTo calculate the expected value, we multiply each possible value by its probability and sum the results. Since the value 1 through 6 are equally likely to be the larger number, we can calculate the expected value as the average of the possible values: $\\frac{(2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{36}) + (3 \\cdot \\frac{2}{36}) + (4 \\cdot \\frac{3}{36}) + (5 \\cdot \\frac{4}{36}) + (6 \\cdot \\frac{5}{36})}{\\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{2}{36} + \\frac{3}{36} + \\frac{4}{36} + \\frac{5}{36} + \\frac{5}{36}}$\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the expression for the expected value\nWe can simplify the expression by first calculating the numerator and denominator separately.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the numerator\nThe numerator is: $(2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{36}) + (3 \\cdot \\frac{2}{36}) + (4 \\cdot \\frac{3}{36}) + (5 \\cdot \\frac{4}{36}) + (6 \\cdot \\frac{5}{36}) = \\frac{2}{36} + \\frac{6}{36} + \\frac{12}{36} + \\frac{20}{36} + \\frac{30}{36} = \\frac{70}{36}$\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the denominator\nThe denominator is: $\\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{2}{36} + \\frac{3}{36} + \\frac{4}{36} + \\frac{5}{36} + \\frac{5}{36} = \\frac{20}{36}$\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the expression for the expected value\nWe can simplify the expression for the expected value by dividing the numerator by the denominator: $\\frac{70}{36} \\div \\frac{20}{36}$\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the expression\nTo simplify the expression, we can invert and multiply: $\\frac{70}{36} \\cdot \\frac{36}{20} = \\frac{70}{20}$\n\n## Step 13: Reduce the fraction\nWe can reduce the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 10. Therefore, $\\frac{70}{20} = \\frac{70 \\div 10}{20 \\div 10} = \\frac{7}{2}$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}$"
