We know that 6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1 and 4! = 4*3*2*1.\n6!+4! = (6*5*4*3*2*1) + (4*3*2*1) = 720 + 24 = 744.\n\n## Step 2: Next, let's compute the denominator of the fraction, which is 5!. We know that 5! = 5*4*3*2*1.\n5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.\n\n## Step 3: Now, let's simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator by the denominator.\n$\\frac{744}{120}$ = 6.2.\n\n## Step 4: Finally, let's express 6.2 as a mixed number. A mixed number is a combination of a whole number and a proper fraction. We know that 6 is the whole number part and 0.2 is the proper fraction part. We can write 0.2 as $\\frac{1}{5}$.\nSo the mixed number is 6 $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6 \\frac{1}{5}}$"
