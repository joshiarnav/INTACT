    "problem": "A senate committee has 5 Republicans and 4 Democrats.  In how many ways can the committee members sit in a row of 9 chairs, such that all 4 Democrats sit together?",
    "solution": "If we consider the group of Democrats as one person, then there are $6!$ ways to arrange the 6 people (the 5 Republicans and the one Democrat group). Then there are $4!$ ways to arrange arranging the 4 Democrats within their group.  So the number of arrangements is $6! \\times 4! = \\boxed{17,\\!280}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem requires us to find the number of ways in which the committee members sit in a row of 9 chairs such that all 4 Democrats sit together.\n## Step 2:  We can break this problem down into several steps. First, we consider the 4 Democrats as a single unit. This effectively reduces the problem to arranging 6 entities: 5 Republicans and 1 unit of Democrats.\n## Step 3:  We can arrange these 6 entities in $6!$ ways, as there are 6 choices for the first position, 5 for the second, and so on until there is only 1 choice for the last position.\n## Step 4:  However, within the unit of Democrats, there are $4!$ ways to arrange the 4 Democrats among themselves. So, for each arrangement of the 6 entities, there are $4!$ ways to arrange the Democrats within their unit.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the committee members such that all 4 Democrats sit together is $6! \\times 4!$.\n## Step 6:  To find the numerical value, we calculate $6! = 720$ and $4! = 24$. Then, we multiply these two values to get $720 \\times 24 = 17,280$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, there are a total of $17,280$ ways to arrange the committee members such that all 4 Democrats sit together.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17280}$"
