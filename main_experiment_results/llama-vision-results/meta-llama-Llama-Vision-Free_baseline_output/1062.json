    "problem": "A turn consists of rolling a standard die and tossing a fair coin. The game is won when the die shows a 1 or a 6 and the coin shows heads. What is the probability the game will be won before the fourth turn? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability of rolling 1 or 6 is $\\frac{2}{6}$, and the probability of flipping heads is $\\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, the probability that the game will end on the first turn is $\\frac{2}{6}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{6}$.  The probability that the game will not end on the first turn is $1-\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{5}{6}$.  Given that the game is still going after 1 turn, the probability that the game will not end on the second turn is also $\\frac{5}{6}$.  Therefore, the probability that the game does not end by the end of the second turn is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2$.  Similarly, the probability that the game is still going after 3 turns is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^3=\\frac{125}{216}$.  So the probability that the game is over by the end of the third turn is $1-\\dfrac{125}{216}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{91}{216}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the probability of winning on the first turn\nThe probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6, and the probability of tossing heads is 1/2. So, the probability of winning on the first turn is (1/6) * (1/2) = 1/12.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of winning on the second turn\nThe probability of not winning on the first turn is 1 - 1/12 = 11/12. The probability of winning on the second turn, given that the first turn was not a win, is (11/12) * (1/6) * (1/2) = 11/144.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of winning on the third turn\nThe probability of not winning on the first two turns is (1 - 1/12) * (1 - 11/144) = (11/12) * (133/144) = 133/1728. The probability of winning on the third turn, given that the first two turns were not wins, is (133/1728) * (1/6) * (1/2) = 133/10368.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of winning on the fourth turn\nHowever, since we're calculating the probability of winning before the fourth turn, we do not need to calculate the probability of winning on the fourth turn.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total probability of winning before the fourth turn\nThe probability of winning before the fourth turn is the sum of the probabilities of winning on the first three turns: 1/12 + 11/144 + 133/10368.\n\n## Step 6: Convert 1/12, 11/144, and 133/10368 to equivalent fractions with a common denominator of 10368.\n1/12 = 864/10368, 11/144 = 726/10368, and 133/10368 remains the same.\n\n## Step 7: Add the fractions with the common denominator 10368.\n(864 + 726 + 133)/10368 = 1723/10368.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the fraction if possible.\nThe fraction 1723/10368 cannot be simplified further.\n\n## Step 9: The probability of winning before the fourth turn is 1723/10368.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1723}{10368}}$"
