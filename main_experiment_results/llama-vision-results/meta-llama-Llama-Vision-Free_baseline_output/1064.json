    "problem": "If two distinct members of the set $\\{ 2, 4, 12, 14, 21, 28, 98 \\}$ are randomly selected and multiplied, what is the probability that the product is a multiple of 196? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Since a multiple of 196 must have 2 factors of 2 and 2 factors of 7, we can count the pairs by focusing on the factors of 7. For one thing, 98 can be paired with any even number as it has 1 factor of 2, since $98=2 \\cdot 7^2$ takes care of all the other primes. So, 98 can be paired with 2, 4, 12, 14, and 28, for 5 pairs. Then, 28 can be paired with (excluding 98 which we already counted) 21 and 14, both of which have the necessary factor of 7, giving us 2 more pairs. There are no remaining pairs of numbers 21 and smaller that are multiples of 196, because the only pair with two factors of 7, $\\{14, 21 \\}$, has a factor of 2 but not 4. So, there are $5+2=7$ pairs. And in total, there are ${7 \\choose 2 } =21$ possible pairs, giving us a probability of $\\frac{7}{21} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what it means for a product to be a multiple of 196. The prime factorization of 196 is 2^2 * 7^2.\n## Step 2:  We have a set {2, 4, 12, 14, 21, 28, 98} from which we need to select two distinct members and then multiply them.\n## Step 3:  For the product to be a multiple of 196, it must contain at least 2^2 * 7^2 as a factor.\n## Step 4:  Let's consider the prime factorization of each number in the set and then identify the pairs whose product will have 2^2 * 7^2 as a factor.\n## Step 5:  From the set, we can see that the numbers 2, 4, 28, and 98 are multiples of 2, while 14, 21, and 98 are multiples of 7.\n## Step 6:  The multiples of 2^2 are 4 and 28, and the multiples of 7^2 are 49, but since 49 is not in the set, we will look for pairs of numbers that, when multiplied, will give us 7^2 as a factor.\n## Step 7:  Now, let's find the pairs of numbers whose product will have 2^2 * 7^2 as a factor.\n## Step 8:  The pairs that satisfy this condition are: (2, 98), (4, 98), (14, 28), (4, 21), and (12, 28), (12, 14), and (28, 21).\n## Step 9:  These are the pairs whose product will be a multiple of 196.\n## Step 10:  Now, we need to find the total number of ways to choose two distinct members from the given set.\n## Step 11:  The total number of ways to choose two distinct members from a set of 7 elements is given by the combination formula C(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7-2)!) = 21.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, there are 7 ways in which we can select a pair of numbers from the given set such that their product is a multiple of 196.\n## Step 13:  So, the probability that the product is a multiple of 196 is 7/21, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$"
