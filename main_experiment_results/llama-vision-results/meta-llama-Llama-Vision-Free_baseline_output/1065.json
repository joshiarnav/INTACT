    "problem": "The dartboard below has a radius of 6 inches. Each of the concentric circles has a radius two inches less than the next larger circle. If nine darts land randomly on the target, how many darts would we expect to land in a non-shaded region?\n\n[asy]import graph;\nfill(Circle((0,0),15),gray(0.7));\nfill(Circle((0,0),10),white);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),20));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),15));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),10));\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "The probability for a single dart to land in the non-shaded region is the ratio of the area of the non-shaded region to the area of the entire dartboard. The area of the entire dartboard is $\\pi \\cdot 6^2 = 36\\pi$. The area of the shaded region is the area of the second largest circle minus the area of the smallest circle, or $\\pi \\cdot 4^2 - \\pi \\cdot 2^2 = 12 \\pi$, so the area of the non-shaded region is $36\\pi - 12\\pi = 24\\pi$. Thus, our ratio is $\\frac{24\\pi}{36\\pi}=\\frac{2}{3}$. If each dart has a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance of landing in a non-shaded region and there are 9 darts, then the expected number of darts that land in a non-shaded region is $9 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\boxed{6}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, we need to understand the layout and dimensions of the dartboard. The dartboard has three concentric circles representing different regions.\n## Step 2:  The largest circle has a radius of 10 inches, the middle circle has a radius of 8 inches, and the innermost circle has a radius of 6 inches.\n## Step 3:  To find the area of each region, we calculate the area of the circles using the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.\n## Step 4:  The area of the largest circle is $\\pi(10^2) = 100\\pi$ square inches.\n## Step 5:  The area of the middle circle is $\\pi(8^2) = 64\\pi$ square inches.\n## Step 6:  The area of the innermost circle is $\\pi(6^2) = 36\\pi$ square inches.\n## Step 7:  The non-shaded region is the area between the largest and middle circles. We can find this area by subtracting the area of the middle circle from the area of the largest circle: $100\\pi - 64\\pi = 36\\pi$ square inches.\n## Step 8:  The shaded region is the area between the middle and innermost circles. We can find this area by subtracting the area of the innermost circle from the area of the middle circle: $64\\pi - 36\\pi = 28\\pi$ square inches.\n## Step 9:  The probability that a dart lands in the non-shaded region is then the ratio of the area of the non-shaded region to the area of the entire dartboard: $\\frac{36\\pi}{100\\pi} = \\frac{9}{25}$.\n## Step 10:  Since there are 9 darts, we can find the expected number of darts to land in the non-shaded region by multiplying the probability by the total number of darts: $9 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{81}{25}$.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, we expect $\\frac{81}{25}$, or $3.24$, of a dart to land in the non-shaded region. Since we can't have a fraction of a dart land in the region, we round this to the nearest whole number.\n## Step 12:  Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get $\\frac{81}{25} \\approx 3.24$, so we expect 3 darts to land in the non-shaded region.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
