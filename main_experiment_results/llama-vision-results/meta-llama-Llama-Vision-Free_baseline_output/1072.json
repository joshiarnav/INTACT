    "problem": "Two cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that they are either both hearts or both diamonds?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{52}{2}=\\frac{52\\cdot 51}{2}=26\\cdot 51$ ways to choose two cards from a 52-card deck. There are $\\binom{13}{2}=\\frac{13\\cdot 12}{2}$ ways to choose two cards which are both hearts, and the same number of ways to choose two cards which are both diamonds. Therefore, the probability of choosing two cards which are both hearts or both diamonds is $\\frac{13 \\cdot 12}{26 \\cdot 51}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{17}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 cards from a 52-card deck\nThe total number of ways to choose 2 cards from a 52-card deck can be calculated using the combination formula: C(52, 2) = 52! / (2! * (52-2)!) = 52! / (2! * 50!) = (52 * 51) / (2 * 1) = 1326.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 hearts\nThere are 13 hearts in a standard 52-card deck. The number of ways to choose 2 hearts can be calculated using the combination formula: C(13, 2) = 13! / (2! * (13-2)!) = 13! / (2! * 11!) = (13 * 12) / (2 * 1) = 78.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 diamonds\nThere are 13 diamonds in a standard 52-card deck. The number of ways to choose 2 diamonds can be calculated using the combination formula: C(13, 2) = 13! / (2! * (13-2)!) = 13! / (2! * 11!) = (13 * 12) / (2 * 1) = 78.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 hearts or 2 diamonds\nSince these events are mutually exclusive, the number of ways to choose 2 hearts or 2 diamonds is the sum of the number of ways to choose 2 hearts and the number of ways to choose 2 diamonds: 78 + 78 = 156.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of choosing 2 hearts or 2 diamonds\nThe probability of choosing 2 hearts or 2 diamonds is the number of ways to choose 2 hearts or 2 diamonds divided by the total number of ways to choose 2 cards from the deck: 156 / 1326.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the fraction\nTo simplify the fraction, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator and divide both by the GCD. The GCD of 156 and 1326 is 6. So, we can simplify the fraction as (156 / 6) / (1326 / 6) = 26 / 221.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction further if possible\nSince 26 and 221 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{26}{221}}$"
