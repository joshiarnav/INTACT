    "solution": "We can see that $3^2 = 9 < 10 < 4^2 = 16$. Thus, $4^2 = 16$ is the smallest perfect square between 10 and 1000.\n\nWe also see that $31^2 = 961 < 1000 < 32^2 = 1024$. Thus, $31^2 = 961$ is the greatest perfect square between 10 and 1000.\n\nIt follows that there are $31 - 4 + 1 = \\boxed{28}$ perfect squares between 10 and 1000.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve the problem, we first need to understand what perfect squares are. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 4, 9, 16, etc., are all perfect squares because they can be expressed as $2^2$, $3^2$, $4^2$, and so on.\n## Step 2:  The problem asks us to find how many perfect squares have a value between 10 and 1000. To approach this, we start by finding the smallest perfect square greater than 10. This will give us the smallest value we need to consider. The smallest perfect square greater than 10 is 16, which is $4^2$.\n## Step 3:  Similarly, we need to find the largest perfect square less than 1000. The largest perfect square less than 1000 is 961, which is $31^2$.\n## Step 4:  We now have the range of perfect squares between 10 and 1000, which is from $4^2$ to $31^2$.\n## Step 5:  To find the number of perfect squares within this range, we can find the difference between the square of the largest and smallest integers within the range and then add 1. Therefore, we need to find $31^2 - 4^2 + 1$.\n## Step 6:  This simplifies to $961 - 16 + 1$, which equals $946$.\n## Step 7:  So, there are $946$ perfect squares between 10 and 1000.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{946}$"
