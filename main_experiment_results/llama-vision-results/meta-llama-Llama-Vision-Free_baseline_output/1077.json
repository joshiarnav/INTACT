    "problem": "A street has 50 houses on each side, for a total of 100 houses. The addresses on the south side of the street form an arithmetic sequence, as do the addresses on the north side of the street. On the south side, the addresses are 1, 5, 9, etc., and on the north side they are 3, 7, 11, etc. A sign painter paints house numbers on a house for $\\$1$ per digit. If he paints the appropriate house number once on each of these 100 houses, how much does he earn?",
    "solution": "If we combine the house numbers on the north and south sides, we get exactly the odd positive integers. The $100^{\\text{th}}$ odd integer is 199, so we divide the first 100 odd integers into three groups: \\[\\{1, 3,\\ldots, 9\\},\\qquad\\{11, 13, \\ldots, 99\\},\\qquad\\{101, 103, \\ldots, 199\\}\\] There are five numbers with one digit, 45 numbers with two digits, and 50 numbers with three digits. Thus, the total revenue is $1\\times5 + 2\\times 45 + 3\\times 50 = \\boxed{245}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the pattern of house numbers on each side of the street\nThe addresses on the south side of the street form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4, starting at 1. The addresses on the north side also form an arithmetic sequence but with a common difference of 4, starting at 3.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the house numbers on each side of the street\nFor the south side, the house numbers will be 1, 5, 9, 13, ..., 49.\nFor the north side, the house numbers will be 3, 7, 11, 15, ..., 99.\n\n## Step 3: Count the number of digits for each side of the street\nSouth side:\n- All the numbers from 1 to 9 are 1-digit numbers, totaling 9 numbers.\n- All the numbers from 10 to 99 that are in the form 1x are 2-digit numbers, totaling 24 numbers (e.g., 10, 11, ..., 19).\n- The remaining numbers from 10 to 99, in the form 1x where x is not 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, will be 3-digit numbers, totaling 16 numbers (e.g., 100, 101, ..., 112).\nNorth side:\n- All the numbers from 3 to 9 are 1-digit numbers, totaling 7 numbers.\n- All the numbers from 10 to 99 that are in the form 3x are 2-digit numbers, totaling 24 numbers (e.g., 30, 31, ..., 39).\n- The remaining numbers from 10 to 99, in the form 3x where x is not 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, will be 3-digit numbers, totaling 16 numbers (e.g., 30, 31, ..., 39).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of digits for each side of the street\nFor the south side:\n- 1-digit numbers: 9 numbers\n- 2-digit numbers: 24 numbers\n- 3-digit numbers: 16 numbers\nTotal digits on south side = (9 x 1) + (24 x 2) + (16 x 3) = 9 + 48 + 48 = 105\nFor the north side:\n- 1-digit numbers: 7 numbers\n- 2-digit numbers: 24 numbers\n- 3-digit numbers: 16 numbers\nTotal digits on north side = (7 x 1) + (24 x 2) + (16 x 3) = 7 + 48 + 48 = 103\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total amount the sign painter earns\nThe total amount the sign painter earns is the sum of the total digits on each side of the street.\nTotal amount earned = total digits on south side + total digits on north side = 105 + 103 = 208\n\n## Step 6: Convert the number of digits to dollars\nSince the painter earns $1 per digit, the total amount he earns is equal to the total number of digits.\nThus, the total amount earned is $\\$208$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{208}$"
