    "problem": "A European train compartment has six seats.  Four of the seats are broken.  Wilhelm needs to fill out a form like the one here to indicate that there are broken seats.  If he randomly checks off four of the seats in the diagram, what is the probability that he marked the correct seats?

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the probability that Wilhelm marked the correct seats, we first need to understand the total number of ways he can choose 4 seats out of the 6 available seats.\n## Step 2:  This can be calculated using combinations, where the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items is given by the formula $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.\n## Step 3:  Applying this formula, we find that there are $\\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = 15$ ways for Wilhelm to choose which 4 seats he marks.\n## Step 4:  Now, we need to determine the number of ways in which Wilhelm can mark 4 seats, such that the seats he marks are the broken ones.\n## Step 5:  Since there are 4 broken seats, Wilhelm has only 1 way to choose which 4 seats are the broken ones.\n## Step 6:  Now that we have the total number of ways for Wilhelm to choose 4 seats and the number of ways he can choose the correct broken seats, we can proceed to find the probability.\n## Step 7:  The probability of an event occurring is given by the number of ways the event can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n## Step 8:  In this case, the probability that Wilhelm marked the correct seats is $\\frac{1}{15}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{15}}$"
