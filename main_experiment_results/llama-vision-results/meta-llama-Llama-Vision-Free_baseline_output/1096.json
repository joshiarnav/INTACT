    "problem": "When Trilisa takes pictures, they turn out with probability $\\frac{1}{5}$. She wants to take enough pictures so that the probability of at least one turning out is at least $\\frac{3}{4}$. How few pictures can she take to accomplish this?",
    "solution": "The probability that at least one picture turns out is $1$ minus the probability that all the pictures do not turn out.  Since the probability that one picture will not turn out is $\\frac{4}{5}$, the probability that $n$ pictures all do not turn out is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n$.  So we want\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n<\\frac{1}{4}\\Rightarrow 4^{n+1}<5^n$$\n\nWe see that $4^7>5^6$, but $4^8<5^7$.  Thus the smallest allowable value of $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the conditions given. Trilisa wants the probability of at least one picture turning out to be at least $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n## Step 2:  This means we can approach the problem by calculating the probability that none of the pictures turn out and then subtracting that from $1$ to find the probability of at least one turning out.\n## Step 3:  Let's assume Trilisa takes $n$ pictures. The probability that the first picture doesn't turn out is $\\frac{4}{5}$, and the probability that the second picture doesn't turn out is also $\\frac{4}{5}$.\n## Step 4:  Extending this, the probability that none of the first $n$ pictures turn out is $\\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right)^n$.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the probability that at least one of the first $n$ pictures turns out is $1 - \\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right)^n$.\n## Step 6:  Trilisa wants this probability to be at least $\\frac{3}{4}$, which gives us the inequality $\\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right)^n \\le \\frac{1}{4}$.\n## Step 7:  To solve for $n$, we need to find the smallest integer value for $n$ such that $\\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right)^n \\le \\frac{1}{4}$ holds true.\n## Step 8:  This involves taking the logarithm of both sides of the inequality to isolate $n$.\n## Step 9:  We know that $\\log\\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right)^n = n\\log\\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right)$, and $\\log\\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = -2$.\n## Step 10:  Substituting these values into the inequality, we get $n\\log\\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right)\\le -2$.\n## Step 11:  Dividing both sides by $\\log\\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right)$, we obtain the inequality $n \\ge \\frac{-2}{\\log\\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right)}$.\n## Step 12:  Now, we need to find the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies this inequality.\n## Step 13:  The expression $\\frac{-2}{\\log\\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right)}$ is approximately equal to $\\frac{25}{6}$.\n## Step 14:  This means that the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies the inequality $n \\ge \\frac{-2}{\\log\\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right)}$ is $n = 6$.\n## Step 15:  Therefore, Trilisa needs to take at least $6$ pictures to ensure that the probability of at least one turning out is at least $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
