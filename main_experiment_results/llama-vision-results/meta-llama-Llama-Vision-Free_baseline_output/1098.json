    "solution": "If the lower cells contain $A$, $B$ and $C$, then the second row will contain $A + B$ and $B + C$, and the top cell will contain $A + 2B+C$. To obtain the smallest sum, place 1  in the center cell and 2 and 3 in the outer ones. The top number will be 7. For the largest sum, place 9 in the center cell and 7 and 8 in the outer ones. This top number will be 33. The difference is $33-7=\\boxed{26}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To start solving this problem, we need to understand the given process. Three different one-digit positive integers are placed in the bottom row of cells. Then, the numbers in adjacent cells are added and the sum is placed in the cell above them. This process continues until a number is obtained in the top cell.\n## Step 2:  We are asked to find the difference between the largest and smallest numbers possible in the top cell after this process is completed.\n## Step 3:  Let's denote the integers in the bottom row as $a$, $b$, and $c$. Then, the numbers in the middle row are $a+b$, $b+c$, and $c+a$. Finally, the number in the top cell is $(a+b)+(b+c)+(c+a)$.\n## Step 4:  This expression simplifies to $2a+2b+2c$, which further simplifies to $2(a+b+c)$.\n## Step 5:  Our goal is to maximize and minimize the value of $a+b+c$ in order to find the largest and smallest possible numbers in the top cell.\n## Step 6:  The maximum value for $a+b+c$ can be obtained by adding the three largest one-digit positive integers, which are $9$, $8$, and $7$. This gives us a sum of $24$.\n## Step 7:  On the other hand, the minimum value for $a+b+c$ can be obtained by adding the three smallest one-digit positive integers, which are $1$, $2$, and $3$. This gives us a sum of $6$.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the largest possible number in the top cell is $2 \\times 24 = 48$ and the smallest possible number is $2 \\times 6 = 12$.\n## Step 9:  The difference between the largest and smallest numbers possible in the top cell is $48-12=36$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$"
