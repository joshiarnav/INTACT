    "solution": "We may assume that one of the triangles is attached to side $\\overline{AB}$. The second triangle can be attached to $\\overline{BC}$ or $\\overline{CD}$ to obtain two non-congruent figures. If the second triangle is attached to $\\overline{AE}$ or to $\\overline{DE}$, the figure can be reflected about the vertical axis of symmetry of the pentagon to obtain one of the two already counted. Thus the total is $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks for the number of non-congruent figures that can be constructed by attaching two equilateral triangles to the regular pentagon $ABCDE$ in two of the five positions shown.\n## Step 2:  First, let's consider the cases where the two equilateral triangles are attached to opposite vertices of the pentagon. This means one triangle is attached to vertex $A$ and the other to the opposite vertex. In this scenario, there are $5$ choices for where to place the first triangle, and once that's done, the second triangle's position is determined as it must be attached to the opposite vertex. However, these configurations are congruent because they are mirror images of each other, resulting in only $1$ unique figure in this case.\n## Step 3:  Next, let's consider the cases where the two equilateral triangles are attached to two adjacent vertices of the pentagon. We can imagine rotating the figure in such a way that one of the triangles is placed at vertex $A$ and the other at vertex $B$. This rotation brings the figure into congruence with another figure where the triangles are at vertices $B$ and $C$. Hence, there are $3$ unique figures in this case, one for each group of three adjacent vertices ($ABC$, $BCD$, and $CDE$).\n## Step 4:  Therefore, the total number of non-congruent figures is obtained by adding the number of unique figures in the two cases, which is $1 + 3 = \\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
