    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Understand the problem\nWe are given the equation $x+2y = 100$ and we are asked to find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ that satisfy this equation.\n\n## Step 2:  Isolate x in the equation\nWe can isolate $x$ by subtracting $2y$ from both sides of the equation, which gives us $x = 100 - 2y$.\n\n## Step 3:  Determine the bounds for y\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, $100 - 2y$ must also be a positive integer. This means that $100 - 2y > 0$. We can solve for $y$ by subtracting 100 from both sides, which gives us $-2y > -100$. Dividing both sides by -2, we get $y < 50$.\n\n## Step 4:  Determine the bounds for x\nSince $y$ is a positive integer, $2y$ must also be a positive integer. This means that $2y > 0$. We can solve for $y$ by dividing both sides by 2, which gives us $y > 0$. Since $y$ is an integer, $y \\geq 1$.\n\n## Step 5:  Determine the range for y\nFrom the previous steps, we know that $y < 50$ and $y \\geq 1$. Therefore, $y$ can take on any integer value from 1 to 49.\n\n## Step 6:  Calculate the number of possible values for y\nSince $y$ can take on any integer value from 1 to 49, there are 49 possible values for $y$.\n\n## Step 7:  For each value of y, calculate the corresponding value of x\nWe can calculate the corresponding value of $x$ for each value of $y$ by substituting the value of $y$ into the equation $x = 100 - 2y$.\n\n## Step 8:  Count the number of ordered pairs (x, y)\nSince there are 49 possible values for $y$, we can pair each value of $y$ with the corresponding value of $x$ calculated in the previous step. This gives us a total of 49 ordered pairs $(x,y)$.\n\n## Step 9:  Consider the restriction on x\nSince $x$ must be a positive integer, we need to check that $x$ is positive for each value of $y$. This is guaranteed since $y \\geq 1$, which makes $x = 100 - 2y$ positive.\n\n## Step 10:  Conclude the final answer\nThere are 49 ordered pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy the equation $x+2y = 100$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{49}$"
