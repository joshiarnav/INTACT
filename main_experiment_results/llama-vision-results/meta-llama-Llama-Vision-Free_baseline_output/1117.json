    "problem": "The sequence 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, $\\ldots$ contains all the positive integers from least to greatest that are neither squares nor cubes nor perfect fifth powers (in the form of $x^{5}$, where $x$ is an integer). What is the $1000^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence?",
    "solution": "We see that it's easier to count the number of perfect squares, perfect cubes and perfect fifth powers less than $33^{2}=1089$. We see there are 32 perfect squares less than 1089, which are $1^2$, $2^2$, $\\ldots$, $32^2$ and then there are 10 perfect cubes which are $1^3$, $\\ldots$, $10^3$. There are 4 perfect fifth powers less than 1089 which are $1^5$, $\\ldots$, $4^5$. Then notice there are 3 numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes which are 1, $2^{6} = 64$ and $3^{6} = 729$. There are also 2 numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect fifth powers which are $1^{10} = 1$ and $2^{10} = 1024$. The only number which is both a perfect cube and a perfect fifth power is $1^{15}=1$. The only number which is a perfect square, perfect cube, and perfect fifth power all at the same time is $1^{30}=1$. So within the first 1089 positive integers we need to get rid of $32+10+4-3-2-1+1 =41$ integers which means the $1000^{\\text{th}}$ term is $1000+41 = \\boxed{1041}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the $1000^{th}$ term of a sequence that contains all positive integers from least to greatest that are neither squares nor cubes nor perfect fifth powers.\n## Step 2:  First, we need to determine the number of perfect squares, perfect cubes, and perfect fifth powers that are less than or equal to $1000$.\n## Step 3:  We start by finding the number of perfect squares. We know that $32^2=1024$, so there are $31$ perfect squares less than or equal to $1000$.\n## Step 4:  Next, we calculate the number of perfect cubes. Given that $10^3=1000$, there are $9$ perfect cubes less than or equal to $1000$.\n## Step 5:  Then, we find the number of perfect fifth powers. We observe that $4^5=1024$, so there are $3$ perfect fifth powers less than or equal to $1000$.\n## Step 6:  It's worth noting that any integer $n$ that is a square, cube, or fifth power will be of the form $n=x^2$, $n=x^3$, or $n=x^5$ for some integer $x$.\n## Step 7:  To find the $1000^{th}$ term, we need to consider these square, cube, and fifth power numbers and the sequence numbers that are greater than these numbers.\n## Step 8:  We need to calculate the total count of perfect squares, cubes, and fifth powers less than or equal to $1000$, which is $31 + 9 + 3 = 43$.\n## Step 9:  Since we need to find the $1000^{th}$ term of the sequence, we need to find the $1000^{th}$ positive integer that is not a perfect square, cube, or fifth power.\n## Step 10:  This means that our answer should be $1000 - 43 = 957$, but we need to find the $957^{th}$ positive integer that is not a perfect square, cube, or fifth power.\n## Step 11:  To do this, we can calculate the number of perfect squares, cubes, and fifth powers less than $957$, which turns out to be $12 + 8 + 2 = 22$.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, the $957^{th}$ positive integer that is not a perfect square, cube, or fifth power is $957 - 22 = 935$.\n## Step 13:  Hence, we can conclude that $935$ is the $1000^{th}$ term of the sequence.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{935}$"
