    "problem": "I draw a card from a standard 52-card deck.  If I draw an Ace, I win 1 dollar.  If I draw a 2 through 10, I win a number of dollars equal to the value of the card.  If I draw a face card (Jack, Queen, or King), I win 20 dollars.  If I draw a $\\clubsuit$, my winnings are doubled, and if I draw a $\\spadesuit$, my winnings are tripled.  (For example, if I draw the $8\\clubsuit$, then I win 16 dollars.)  What would be a fair price to pay to play the game?  Express your answer as a dollar value rounded to the nearest cent.\n\nYour answer should be a number with two digits after the decimal point, like $21.43$.",
    "solution": "Let $E_1$ be the expected winnings if a $\\heartsuit$ or $\\diamondsuit$ is drawn.  Since the probability that any particular rank is drawn is the same for any rank, the expected value is simply the average all the winnings for each rank, so \\[ E_1 = \\frac{1}{13}(\\$1+\\$2+\\cdots+\\$10+(3\\times\\$20)) = \\$\\frac{115}{13}. \\]Let $E_2$ be the expected winnings if a $\\clubsuit$ is drawn and $E_3$ the expected winnings if a $\\spadesuit$ is drawn.  Since drawing a $\\clubsuit$ doubles the winnings and drawing a $\\spadesuit$ triples the winnings, $E_2 = 2E_1$ and $E_3 = 3E_1$.  Since there is an equal chance drawing each of the suits, we can average their expected winnings to find the overall expected winnings.  Therefore the expected winnings are \\[ E = \\frac{1}{4}(E_1 + E_1 + E_2 + E_3) = \\frac{1}{4}(7E_1) = {\\$\\frac{805}{52}}, \\]or about $\\boxed{\\$15.48}$, which is the fair price to pay to play the game.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing each card\nWe first need to calculate the probability of drawing each type of card: Ace, 2-10, face card, $\\clubsuit$, and $\\spadesuit$. There are 52 cards in a standard deck, so the probability of drawing any specific card is $\\frac{1}{52}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing an Ace\nThere are 4 Aces in a standard deck of cards, so the probability of drawing an Ace is $\\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of drawing a 2-10\nThere are 9 cards (2-10) for each of the 4 suits, so the probability of drawing a 2-10 is $\\frac{36}{52} = \\frac{9}{13}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of drawing a face card\nThere are 12 face cards (Jack, Queen, King) for each of the 4 suits, so the probability of drawing a face card is $\\frac{48}{52} = \\frac{12}{13}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of drawing a $\\clubsuit$\nThere are 13 cards of each suit, so the probability of drawing a $\\clubsuit$ is $\\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of drawing a $\\spadesuit$\nThere are 13 cards of each suit, so the probability of drawing a $\\spadesuit$ is $\\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the expected value of the game\nTo calculate the expected value of the game, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by the amount won and then sum these products. For an Ace, we win 1 dollar with probability $\\frac{1}{13}$, so the expected value from an Ace is $1 \\times \\frac{1}{13} = \\frac{1}{13}$. For a 2-10, we win the value of the card with probability $\\frac{9}{13}$, so the expected value from a 2-10 is $\\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10}{13} = \\frac{55}{13}$. For a face card, we win 20 dollars with probability $\\frac{12}{13}$, so the expected value from a face card is $20 \\times \\frac{12}{13} = \\frac{240}{13}$. For a $\\clubsuit$, we win the value of the card doubled with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$, so the expected value from a $\\clubsuit$ is $2 \\times \\frac{1}{4}(\\frac{1}{13}+\\frac{2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10}{13}+\\frac{240}{13}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{13}+\\frac{55}{13}+\\frac{240}{13}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{296}{13}) = \\frac{148}{13}$. For a $\\spadesuit$, we win the value of the card tripled with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$, so the expected value from a $\\spadesuit$ is $3 \\times \\frac{1}{4}(\\frac{1}{13}+\\frac{2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10}{13}+\\frac{240}{13}) = \\frac{3}{4}(\\frac{1}{13}+\\frac{55}{13}+\\frac{240}{13}) = \\frac{3}{4}(\\frac{296}{13}) = \\frac{888}{13}$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total expected value\nNow we need to add up all of the expected values from each type of card: $\\frac{1}{13} + \\frac{55}{13} + \\frac{240}{13} + \\frac{148}{13} + \\frac{888}{13} = \\frac{1332}{13} = 102.3077...$\n\n## Step 9: Round to the nearest cent\nThe expected value is approximately $102.31$ dollars.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{102.31}$"
