    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the concept of a diagonal in a polyhedron. A diagonal of a polyhedron is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices.\n## Step 2:  We are given a pentagonal prism, which means it has a pentagonal base and rectangular lateral faces.\n## Step 3:  The pentagonal base has 5 vertices, and each vertex can be connected to 2 other vertices to form a diagonal. So, initially, we might think that there are $5 \\times 2 = 10$ diagonals in the pentagonal base.\n## Step 4:  However, we need to consider that each diagonal was counted twice, once for each of its endpoints. This means we have to divide the total count by 2 to avoid double counting.\n## Step 5:  After accounting for this double counting, we find that there are actually $\\frac{5 \\times 2}{2} = 5$ diagonals in the pentagonal base.\n## Step 6:  Now, we move on to the rectangular lateral faces of the pentagonal prism. Each of these faces is a rectangle, and we know that the diagonals of a rectangle are the lines connecting the opposite vertices.\n## Step 7:  There are 5 rectangular lateral faces in the prism, and each face has 2 diagonals.\n## Step 8:  So, the total number of diagonals in the rectangular faces is $5 \\times 2 = 10$.\n## Step 9:  Finally, we need to find the total number of diagonals in the entire prism. We can do this by adding the number of diagonals in the pentagonal base to the number of diagonals in the rectangular faces.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the total number of diagonals in the pentagonal prism is $5 + 10 = 15$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
