    "problem": "There are 30 men and 40 women in the Town Library Club.  They wish to form a 7-person steering committee with 3 men and 4 women.  In how many ways can they form the committee?",
    "solution": "In this problem, we're really selecting two separate committees.  We can choose 3 men from the 30 men total in $$ \\binom{30}{3} = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 4,\\!060 $$ways, and 4 women from the 40 women total in $$ \\binom{40}{4} = \\frac{40 \\times 39 \\times 38 \\times 37}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 91,\\!390 $$ways.  Since these two selections are independent (since for each of the $4,\\!060$ ways to pick the men, there are $91,\\!390$ ways to pick the women), we multiply them together to get the number of ways that we can form the 7-member overall committee: $$ \\binom{30}{3}\\binom{40}{4} = (4,\\!060)(91,\\!390) = \\boxed{371,\\!043,\\!400}. $$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to select 3 men from 30.\nTo select 3 men from 30, we use the combination formula since the order of selection doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, the product of all positive integers up to that number. For the men, this is C(30, 3).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate C(30, 3).\nC(30, 3) = 30! / (3!(30-3)!) = 30! / (3! * 27!) = (30*29*28) / (3*2*1) = 4060.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to select 4 women from 40.\nSimilarly, to select 4 women from 40, we use the combination formula. This is C(40, 4).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate C(40, 4).\nC(40, 4) = 40! / (4!(40-4)!) = 40! / (4! * 36!) = (40*39*38*37) / (4*3*2*1) = 91390.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of ways to form the committee by multiplying the number of ways to select men and women.\nThe total number of ways to form the committee is the product of the number of ways to select the men and the number of ways to select the women, since for each selection of men, there are that many selections of women. Total = C(30, 3) * C(40, 4).\n\n## Step 6: Multiply the results from step 2 and step 4 to get the total.\nTotal = 4060 * 91390.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the final product.\nTotal = 37,136,540.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{37136540}$"
