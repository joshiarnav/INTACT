    "problem": "Without looking at the labels, Adrien placed four CDs in four cases. What is the probability that exactly two of the CDs are in the wrong cases? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Given any pair of the 4 CDs, there is exactly one arrangement with only these two CDs in the correct cases, because each of the remaining two CDs must be in the case of the other one.  Therefore, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ arrangements of the CDs for which exactly two of the CDs are in the correct case.  The probability that one of these 6 arrangements will be chosen from among the $4!=24$ equally likely arrangements is $\\dfrac{6}{24}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the total number of possible outcomes and the number of successful outcomes where exactly two CDs are in the wrong cases.\n## Step 2:  Since there are four CDs and four cases, the total number of possible arrangements of CDs into cases is given by $4!$, which equals $24$.\n## Step 3:  Now, let's consider the successful outcomes, which occur when exactly two of the CDs are in the wrong cases. We can approach this by choosing which two CDs are in the wrong cases, and then determining the arrangements of these CDs.\n## Step 4:  First, we choose which two CDs are in the wrong cases. There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose two CDs from the four available CDs.\n## Step 5:  Now, for a fixed choice of CDs, there are $2$ ways to arrange them in the wrong cases. This is because there are $2$ possible ways to swap the CDs for each pair of CDs we choose.\n## Step 6:  Thus, the total number of successful outcomes is given by multiplying the number of ways to choose the CDs and the number of ways to arrange them, which is $6 \\cdot 2 = 12$.\n## Step 7:  To find the probability, we divide the number of successful outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability that exactly two CDs are in the wrong cases is $\\frac{12}{24}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$"
