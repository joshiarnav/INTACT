    "problem": "There are four red balls and two white balls in a jar. One ball is randomly removed and replaced with a ball of the opposite color. The jar is then shaken and one ball is randomly selected. What is the probability that this ball is red? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We split the problem into two cases.\n\nCase I: A red ball is removed. The probability that a red ball is removed is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$. After it is replaced by a white ball, the probability of drawing a red ball is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the probability that a red ball will be drawn in this case is $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nCase II: A white ball is removed. The probability that a white ball is removed is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$. After it is replaced by a red ball, the probability of drawing a red ball is $\\frac{5}{6}$. Thus, the probability that a red ball will be drawn in this case is $\\frac{5}{18}$.\n\nWe add the two probabilities for a total probability of $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{18}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the probability of selecting a red ball initially and then replacing it with a white ball.\nThe probability of initially selecting a red ball is 4/6, since there are 4 red balls out of a total of 6 balls. The probability of replacing it with a white ball is 2/6, since there are 2 white balls out of a total of 6 balls. So, the probability of selecting a red ball initially and then replacing it with a white ball is (4/6)*(2/6).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of selecting a white ball initially and then replacing it with a red ball.\nThe probability of initially selecting a white ball is 2/6, since there are 2 white balls out of a total of 6 balls. The probability of replacing it with a red ball is 4/6, since there are 4 red balls out of a total of 6 balls. So, the probability of selecting a white ball initially and then replacing it with a red ball is (2/6)*(4/6).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of selecting a red ball after replacing a ball of either color.\nTo find the total probability of selecting a red ball after replacing a ball of either color, we must add the probabilities calculated in Steps 1 and 2. This gives us (4/6)*(2/6) + (2/6)*(4/6).\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression from Step 3.\nWe can simplify the expression (4/6)*(2/6) + (2/6)*(4/6) as follows: (8/36) + (8/36) = 16/36.\n\n## Step 5: Reduce the fraction 16/36 to its simplest form.\nWe can reduce the fraction 16/36 by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4. This gives us 4/9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$"
