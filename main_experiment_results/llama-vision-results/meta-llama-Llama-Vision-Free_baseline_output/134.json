    "problem": "In how many ways can 8 people sit around a round table if 3 of the people -- Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas -- all want to sit together?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "First choose three consecutive seats for Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.  It doesn't matter which three consecutive seats that we choose, since any three such seats can be rotated to any other such seats.  Once the three seats are chosen, there are $3!$ ways to seat the three friends there.  The other five seats are for the other five people, so there are $5!$ ways to seat them there.  The answer is $3! \\times 5! = \\boxed{720}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, let's treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as one single entity since they all want to sit together.\nThis means we now have 6 \"people\" to arrange around the table.\n\n## Step 2: The number of ways to arrange 6 people around a round table is (6-1)! because we're dealing with circular permutations.\nThe formula for circular permutations is (n-1)!, where n is the number of items to arrange. In this case, n = 6, so there are (6-1)! = 5! ways to arrange the 6 entities around the table.\n\n## Step 3: However, within the entity of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas, there are 3! ways they can arrange themselves.\nSince Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit in any order among themselves, we need to multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 entities by the number of ways they can arrange themselves.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways for Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas to sit together around the round table.\nMultiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 entities by the number of ways they can arrange themselves: 5! * 3!.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate 5!.\n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate 3!.\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n\n## Step 7: Multiply the results of 5! and 3! to find the total number of ways Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit together.\n120 * 6 = 720.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{720}$"
