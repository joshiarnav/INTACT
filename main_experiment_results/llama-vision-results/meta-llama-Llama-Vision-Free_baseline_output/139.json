    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem presents a grid with points $A$ and $B$ and asks for the number of paths from $A$ to $B$ while only moving up or to the right.\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we can consider the path as a sequence of steps, where each step can be either up or to the right.\n## Step 3:  Looking at the grid, we see that there are 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up in order to reach point $B$ from point $A$.\n## Step 4:  This means that we can represent each valid path as a string of length 5, consisting of 3 Rs (right steps) and 2 Us (up steps).\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to arrange these 3 Rs and 2 Us in a string of length 5.\n## Step 6:  This is a classic problem of combinations, where we need to choose 2 positions out of 5 to place the Us, and the remaining positions will automatically be Rs.\n## Step 7:  The number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 5 is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $k$ is the number of items to choose.\n## Step 8:  Substituting $n=5$ and $k=2$ into the combination formula, we get $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, there are 10 possible paths from $A$ to $B$ on the grid, considering that every step must be up or to the right.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
