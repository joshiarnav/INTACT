    "problem": "The Coventry School's European debate club has 6 German delegates, 5 French delegates, and 3 Italian delegates.  In how many ways can these 14 delegates sit in a row of 14 chairs, if each country's delegates insist on all sitting next to each other?",
    "solution": "We first think of the German delegates forming a single German block, denoted G, the French delegates forming a single French block F, and the Italian delegates forming a single Italian block I.  Then there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the three blocks in a row: $$ \\text{\\textbf{\\large FGI, FIG, GFI, GIF, IFG, IGF.}} $$ Within each block, there are $6!$ ways to arrange the German delegates, $5!$ ways to arrange the French delegates, and $3!$ ways to arrange the Italian delegates.  Therefore, there are $$ 3! \\times 6! \\times 5! \\times 3! = 6 \\times 720 \\times 120 \\times 6 = \\boxed{3,\\!110,\\!400} $$ ways to seat all 14 delegates.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the total number of delegates and the requirement for each country's delegates to sit together.\nThere are 14 delegates in total (6 German, 5 French, and 3 Italian). We need to find the number of ways these delegates can sit in a row such that the delegates from each country sit next to each other.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the problem into smaller parts.\nTo address this, we can break it down into smaller parts: first, we arrange the countries (German, French, Italian), and then we arrange the delegates within each country.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the countries.\nSince there are 3 countries, and they need to sit next to each other, we can treat each group of country delegates as one unit. Therefore, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the countries.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to arrange delegates within each country.\nWithin each country, the delegates can sit in different orders. For the 6 German delegates, there are 6! = 720 ways to arrange them. For the 5 French delegates, there are 5! = 120 ways to arrange them. For the 3 Italian delegates, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange them.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of ways to arrange the delegates.\nThe total number of ways is the product of the number of ways to arrange the countries and the number of ways to arrange delegates within each country: 6 * 720 * 120 * 6.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the multiplication to find the total number of ways.\n6 * 720 = 4320, 4320 * 120 = 518400, 518400 * 6 = 3110400.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3110400}$"
