    "solution": "We start off with $\\emph{1}$ large rectangle. Then the horizontal and vertical lines together split the large rectangle into $\\emph{4}$ smaller rectangles. In addition, the vertical line by itself splits the large rectangle into $\\emph{2}$ rectangles and the horizontal line by itself splits the large rectangle into $\\emph{2}$ other rectangles. There are $1+4+2+2=\\boxed{9}$ different rectangles in the figure.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Let's start by understanding what constitutes a rectangle in the given figure. A rectangle is formed by two horizontal lines and two vertical lines.\n## Step 2:  In the given figure, there are two horizontal lines and two vertical lines that intersect at various points, forming rectangles.\n## Step 3:  Firstly, let's consider the two horizontal lines and the two vertical lines separately. When we choose any two of the five horizontal lines and any two of the four vertical lines, a rectangle is formed.\n## Step 4:  To calculate the total number of rectangles, we need to consider the combinations of these lines. There are ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ ways to choose two horizontal lines from the five available lines and ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ ways to choose two vertical lines from the four available lines.\n## Step 5:  By the rule of product, we can calculate the total number of rectangles formed by these combinations by multiplying the number of ways to choose horizontal lines and vertical lines, giving us $10 \\times 6 = 60$ rectangles.\n## Step 6:  However, this count includes rectangles that are formed by the intersection of the two horizontal lines and the two vertical lines. These are the rectangles that form the smaller squares within the larger figure. There are 4 of these smaller rectangles, which are counted multiple times in the previous count of 60 rectangles.\n## Step 7:  To correct for this double counting, we need to subtract the number of smaller rectangles, which is 4, from our previous count of 60 rectangles.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the total number of different rectangles in the figure is $60 - 4 = 56$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{56}$"
