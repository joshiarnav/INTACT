    "problem": "A Senate committee has 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent.  In how many ways can they sit around a circular table if all the members of each party all sit next to each other?  (Two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "Choose any seat in which to place the Independent -- it doesn't matter which seat that we choose, since we can rotate the table. Once the Independent's seat has been chosen, either all the Democrats sit to their left and all the Republicans sit to their right, or the other way around. Either way, there are $5!$ ways to put the Democrats in their seats, and $5!$ ways to put the Republicans in their seats. So, the total number of ways to seat the people around the table is $2\\cdot5!\\cdot5!=2\\cdot120\\cdot120=\\boxed{28800}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Consider the restrictions on seating.\nThe members of each party must sit next to each other. This means we can consider the members of each party as a single \"unit\" for the initial placement.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the party units around the circular table.\nSince there are 3 party units (Democrats, Republicans, and Independents), and 3! ways to arrange these units around a circular table, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the party units.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the members within each party unit.\nFor Democrats, there are 5! ways to arrange the members. Similarly, there are 5! ways to arrange the Republicans and 1! (which equals 1) way to arrange the Independent.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways to seat the committee.\nMultiply the number of ways to arrange the party units by the number of ways to arrange the members within each party unit. This is equal to 6 * 5! * 5! * 1 = 6 * 120 * 120 * 1 = 6 * 144000 = 864000.\n\n## Step 5: Since two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other, we need to divide the total number of ways by the number of possible rotations.\nThere are 3 possible rotations for each seating, since a circular table has 3 rotations that are considered the same (i.e., rotating the table 1 position, 2 positions, or 3 positions results in the same arrangement).\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final number of ways to seat the committee.\nDivide the total number of ways to seat the committee by the number of possible rotations: 864000 / 3 = 288000.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{288000}$"
