    "problem": "The letters $A, B$ and $C$ are used to form every possible three letter ``word.'' When these ``words'' are arranged in alphabetical order and numbered so that $AAA$ is Word 1 and $CCC$ is Word 27, what number will correspond to the position of word $BAB$ on the list?",
    "solution": "There are 9 possible words that start with A to begin the list, so the first word starting with B, BAA, is the 10th word. BAB is the next word after BAA, or word number $\\boxed{11}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of possible three-letter words that can be formed using the letters A, B, and C.\nThere are 3 choices for each position in the three-letter word (A, B, or C), and since there are 3 positions, the total number of possible words is 3 * 3 * 3 = 27.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the words that start with A.\nThere are 3 possible words that start with A: AAB, ABB, and ACC.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the words that start with B.\nThere are 3 possible words that start with B: BAA, BAB, and BCC.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the words that start with C.\nThere are 3 possible words that start with C: CAA, CAB, and CCC.\n\n## Step 5: Count the number of words that come before the word BAB on the list.\nThe words that come before BAB are the ones that start with A and the ones that start with B and have A as their second letter. There are 3 words that start with A and 1 word that starts with B and has A as its second letter.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of words that come before the word BAB on the list.\nThe total number of words that come before BAB is the sum of the words that start with A and the words that start with B and have A as their second letter, which is 3 + 1 = 4.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the position of the word BAB on the list.\nTo find the position of the word BAB on the list, we need to add the number of words that come before it to its own position. Since the word BAB is the 4th word in the list of words that start with B, we can find the position of BAB by adding the total number of words that come before it (4) to its own position (4), but we need to consider that we counted the 4 words that start with A and the 1 word that starts with B and has A as its second letter, however, we also counted 1 more word that starts with B and has A as its second letter which is BAA.\n\n## Step 8: Find the correct position of word BAB\nSince the word BAB is the 4th word in the list of words that start with B, we can find the position of BAB by adding the total number of words that come before it (4). We need to find the position of the word BAA which comes before BAB and is the 3rd word in the list of words that start with B. So the position of the word BAB is 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6.\n\n## Step 9: Also note that the correct way to count the position for the word BAB was not explained correctly in the previous steps, we need to re-evaluate the counting method.\n\n## Step 10: Correctly identify the words that come before the word BAB on the list.\nTo find the position of the word BAB on the list, we need to count the number of words that come before it. Word AAA comes first, followed by the three words that start with A and have B as their second letter, then the three words that start with A and have C as their second letter, then the three words that start with B and have A as their second letter, then the word BAB, then the three words that start with B and have C as their second letter, then the three words that start with C and have A as their second letter, then the two words that start with C and have B as their second letter, then the word CCC.\n\n## Step 11: Correctly count the position of the word BAB on the list.\nThe first word is AAA. Then there are 3 words that start with A and have B as their second letter (AAB, ABB, and ABC). Then there are 3 words that start with A and have C as their second letter (ACC, AEC, and AEC - Since there are only 3 distinct letters, and we have used A and B, we can only use C as the second letter). Then there is 1 word that starts with B and has A as its second letter (BAA). Then there is 1 word that starts with B and has A as its second letter (BAB). Therefore, the correct count of words that come before the word BAB is 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 9.\n\n## Step 12: The correct position of BAB on the list.\nSince there are 9 words that come before the word BAB, the correct position of the word BAB on the list is 9 + 1 = 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
