    "problem": "Two different 2-digit numbers are randomly chosen and multiplied together.  What is the probability that the resulting product is even?",
    "solution": "Here an `outcome' is selecting two different 2-digit numbers, without regard to order.  There are 90 2-digit numbers, so this can be done in $\\binom{90}{2} = 4005$ ways.\n\nNow we need to count the successful outcomes.  Two numbers multiply together to give an even number if at least one of the original numbers is even.  To count this will require some casework.  However, casework makes us think about using complementary counting here.  We see that it's easier to count when the product of two numbers is odd: this happens when both original numbers are odd.\n\nThere are 45 odd 2-digit numbers, so two of them can be chosen in $\\binom{45}{2}= 990$ ways.  These are the unsuccessful outcomes, so there are $4005-990 = 3015$ successful outcomes.  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{3015}{4005} = \\boxed{\\frac{67}{89}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define what makes a product even.\nA product of two numbers is even if at least one of the two numbers is even.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of 2-digit numbers.\nThe smallest 2-digit number is 10, and the largest is 99. Therefore, there are 90 2-digit numbers in total (99 - 10 + 1 = 90).\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of even 2-digit numbers.\nSince every other number is even, we can find the number of even 2-digit numbers by dividing the total number of 2-digit numbers by 2, which gives us 45 even numbers.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the number of odd 2-digit numbers.\nSince there are 90 2-digit numbers in total and 45 of them are even, the remaining 45 must be odd.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 numbers from the 90 available.\nThis can be calculated using combinations, where n is the total number (90) and r is the number of items to choose (2). The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / [r!(n - r)!]. Here, it is 90C2 = 90! / [2!(90 - 2)!].\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 numbers such that the product is even.\nThis can happen in two ways: (i) choosing 2 even numbers, or (ii) choosing 1 even number and 1 odd number. The number of ways to choose 2 even numbers is 45C2, and the number of ways to choose 1 even and 1 odd number is 45C1 * 45C1.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 even numbers.\nUsing the formula for combinations from step 5, we find 45C2 = 45! / [2!(45 - 2)!].\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the number of ways to choose 1 even and 1 odd number.\nUsing the formula for combinations from step 5, we find 45C1 * 45C1 = (45 * 45).\n\n## Step 9: Combine the results from steps 7 and 8 to find the total number of ways to get an even product.\nWe add the results from steps 7 and 8: 45C2 + (45C1 * 45C1).\n\n## Step 10: Calculate 45C2.\n45C2 = 45! / [2!(45 - 2)!] = (45 * 44) / (2 * 1) = 990.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate (45C1 * 45C1).\n(45C1 * 45C1) = (45 * 45) = 2025.\n\n## Step 12: Add the results from steps 10 and 11 to find the total number of ways to get an even product.\nTotal number of ways to get an even product = 990 + 2025 = 3015.\n\n## Step 13: Calculate 90C2.\nUsing the formula for combinations, 90! / [2!(90 - 2)!] = (90 * 89) / (2 * 1) = 4045.\n\n## Step 14: Calculate the probability of getting an even product.\nThe probability of getting an even product is the number of ways to get an even product divided by the total number of ways to choose 2 numbers. This is 3015 / 4045.\n\n## Step 15: Simplify the fraction 3015 / 4045 to find the probability.\n3015 and 4045 are both divisible by 5, so simplify the fraction: 3015 / 4045 = 603 / 809.\n\n## Step 16: Calculate the probability as a decimal to confirm the simplification.\n(603 / 809) = 0.7449 (rounded to four decimal places).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{603}{809}}$"
