    "solution": "There are 12 face cards, so there are $\\binom{12}{2}$ ways to choose 2 face cards (without regard to order).  There are $\\binom{52}{2}$ ways to choose any 2 cards (without regard to order).  So the answer is \\[\\frac{\\binom{12}{2}}{\\binom{52}{2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{11}{221}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 cards from a 52-card deck.\nThere are 52 cards in the deck, and we are choosing 2 of them, so the total number of ways to choose 2 cards is given by the combination formula $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $k$ is the number of items to choose, and $!$ denotes factorial. In this case, $n=52$ and $k=2$, so we have $C(52, 2) = \\frac{52!}{2!(52-2)!} = \\frac{52*51}{2} = 1326$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of face cards in the deck.\nThere are 3 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades), and each suit has 3 face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings). Therefore, the total number of face cards is $3*3 = 9$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 face cards from the deck.\nWe have 9 face cards, and we are choosing 2 of them, so the number of ways to choose 2 face cards is given by the combination formula $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n=9$ and $k=2$. Therefore, $C(9, 2) = \\frac{9!}{2!(9-2)!} = \\frac{9*8}{2} = 36$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that both cards chosen are face cards.\nThe probability is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (choosing 2 face cards) to the total number of outcomes (choosing 2 cards from the deck). Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{36}{1326} = \\frac{6}{221}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{6}{221}}$"
