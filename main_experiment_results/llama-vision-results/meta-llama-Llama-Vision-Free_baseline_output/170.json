    "problem": "Suppose you have a weighted coin in which heads comes up with probability $\\frac34$ and tails with probability $\\frac14$.  If you flip heads, you win 2 dollars, but if you flip tails, you lose 1 dollar.  What is the expected value of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal.",
    "solution": "By definition, we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities, and add them up: $E = \\frac34(+\\$2) + \\frac14(-\\$1) = \\$1.50 - \\$0.25 = \\boxed{\\$1.25}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the probabilities of the outcomes\nThe probability of flipping heads, which results in winning 2 dollars, is $\\frac{3}{4}$. The probability of flipping tails, which results in losing 1 dollar, is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the value of flipping heads\nThe value of flipping heads is 2 dollars.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the value of flipping tails\nThe value of flipping tails is -1 dollar.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the expected value of a coin flip\nTo find the expected value, we multiply each outcome's value by its probability and then sum these products. The expected value is thus $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)(2) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)(-1)$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the arithmetic\n$\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)(2) = \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5$ and $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)(-1) = -\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 6: Sum the results of the arithmetic\n$1.5 - \\frac{1}{4} = 1.5 - 0.25 = 1.25$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.25}$"
