    "problem": "My state's lottery has 30 white balls numbered from 1 through 30 and 20 red balls numbered from 1 through 20.  In each lottery drawing, 3 of the white balls and 2 of the red balls are drawn.  To win, you must match all 3 white balls and both red balls, without regard to the order in which they were drawn.  How many possible different combinations may be drawn?",
    "solution": "There are 30 ways to draw the first white ball, 29 ways to draw the second, and 28 ways to draw the third.  However, since order doesn't matter, we must divide by $3!$ to get $\\dfrac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28}{3!} = 4060$ ways to draw three white balls.  There are 20 ways to draw the first red ball and 19 ways to draw the second, however, since order doesn't matter, we must divide by $2!$ to get $\\dfrac{20 \\times 19}{2!} = 190$ ways to draw two red balls.  So the total number of outcomes for both the red and the white balls is $4060 \\times 190 = \\boxed{771,\\!400}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 white balls from 30.\nThe number of ways to choose 3 white balls from 30 is given by the combination formula, C(30, 3). This can be calculated as 30! / (3!(30-3)!) = 30! / (3!27!) = (30*29*28) / (3*2*1) = 4060.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 20.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 20 is given by the combination formula, C(20, 2). This can be calculated as 20! / (2!(20-2)!) = 20! / (2!18!) = (20*19) / (2*1) = 190.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of combinations by multiplying the number of ways to choose white balls and red balls.\nThe total number of combinations is the product of the number of ways to choose the white balls and the number of ways to choose the red balls. This is 4060 * 190.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final product.\nThe final product is 4060 * 190 = 771800.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{771800}$"
