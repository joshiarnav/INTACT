    "problem": "Suppose 2 distinct integers are chosen from 1 through 9, inclusive.  What is the probability that they are both odd?",
    "solution": "Let's consider an `outcome' to be a choice of 2 numbers without regard to order.  There are $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ ways to choose 2 numbers from our set of 9 if we don't care about order.  There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to choose 2 numbers from the 5 odd numbers without regard to order.  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{10}{36} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 distinct integers from 1 through 9.\nThe total number of ways to choose 2 distinct integers from 1 through 9 can be calculated using the combination formula: $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items chosen. In this case, n = 9 and r = 2. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose 2 distinct integers from 1 through 9 is $\\binom{9}{2} = \\frac{9!}{2!(9-2)!} = \\frac{9*8}{2} = 36$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 distinct odd integers from 1 through 9.\nThere are 5 odd integers between 1 and 9 (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9). The number of ways to choose 2 distinct odd integers can be calculated using the combination formula: $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where n is the total number of odd integers and r is the number of odd integers chosen. In this case, n = 5 and r = 2. Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 distinct odd integers is $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5*4}{2} = 10$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability that two distinct integers chosen from 1 through 9 are both odd.\nThe probability that two distinct integers chosen from 1 through 9 are both odd can be calculated by dividing the number of ways to choose 2 distinct odd integers by the total number of ways to choose 2 distinct integers. Probability = (Number of ways to choose 2 distinct odd integers) / (Total number of ways to choose 2 distinct integers) = 10 / 36 = 5 / 18.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}$"
