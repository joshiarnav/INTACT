    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the pattern of squares formed on the given $3 \\times n$ grid of points.\n## Step 2:  Let's start by identifying the different sizes of squares that can be formed. We notice that $1 \\times 1$ squares can be formed by choosing any two adjacent points on the grid, $2 \\times 2$ squares can be formed by choosing any two adjacent $1 \\times 1$ squares, and $3 \\times 3$ squares can be formed by choosing any two adjacent $2 \\times 2$ squares.\n## Step 3:  Now, let's consider the total count of each type of square formed on the grid. There are $(n - 2) \\times 3$ unit squares, $(n - 3) \\times 2$ of the $2 \\times 2$ squares, and $(n - 4)$ of the $3 \\times 3$ squares.\n## Step 4:  Adding these up gives us a total of $3n - 6 + 2n - 6 + n - 4 = 6n - 16$ squares in total.\n## Step 5:  However, we are given that there are a total of $70$ squares on the grid. So, we can equate the total number of squares to the given value and solve for $n$.\n## Step 6:  Setting up the equation, we get $6n - 16 = 70$.\n## Step 7:  Solving for $n$, we add $16$ to both sides of the equation, which gives us $6n = 86$.\n## Step 8:  Finally, dividing by $6$ yields $n = \\frac{86}{6}$.\n## Step 9:  So, the value of $n$ is $n = 14.\\overline{3}$, but since the number of squares on the grid must be an integer, we can check if the actual grid can accommodate a non-integer number of squares.\n## Step 10:  Looking at the diagram, we observe that it is possible to have $14$ squares on each row, but not $14.\\overline{3}$ squares.\n## Step 11:  This leads us to try $n = 14$ and verify if the resulting total number of squares is indeed $70$.\n## Step 12:  For $n = 14$, there are $12$ unit squares, $10$ $2 \\times 2$ squares, and $6$ $3 \\times 3$ squares. This results in a total of $12 + 20 + 6 = 38$ squares.\n## Step 13:  Since this is less than $70$, we can try $n = 15$. For $n = 15$, there are $13$ unit squares, $11$ $2 \\times 2$ squares, and $5$ $3 \\times 3$ squares. This results in a total of $39 + 22 + 5 = 66$ squares.\n## Step 14:  Since this is still less than $70$, we can try $n = 16$. For $n = 16$, there are $14$ unit squares, $12$ $2 \\times 2$ squares, and $4$ $3 \\times 3$ squares. This results in a total of $42 + 24 + 4 = 70$ squares.\n## Step 15:  Therefore, the value of $n$ that gives us a total of $70$ squares on the grid is $n = 16$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$"
