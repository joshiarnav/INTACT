    "problem": "Suppose that $*(n) = \\left\\{ n-2, n+2, 2n, \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\}$. For example, $*(6) = \\{4, 8, 12, 3\\}$. For how many distinct integers $n$ does $*(n)$ have exactly three distinct elements?",
    "solution": "To have three distinct elements, two of $n-2$, $n+2$, $2n$, and $\\frac{n}{2}$ must be equal. It is clear that $n-2$ can never equal $n+2$. However, any other equality pairing among the four is possible, so we simply check for distinctness. If $2n = \\frac{n}{2}$, the solution is $n= 0$. If $n+ 2 = 2n$, $n = 2$. If $n - 2 = 2n$, $n = -2$. If $\\frac{n}{2} = n - 2$, $n = 4$. Finally, if $\\frac{n}{2} = n+ 2$, $n = -4$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{5}$ such $n$.",

If $n$ is even, then the set $*(n)$ contains the elements $\\{n-2, n+2, 2n, \\frac{n}{2}\\}$. For $*(n)$ to have exactly three distinct elements, we must have $n-2 = n+2$ or $n-2 = 2n$ or $n-2 = \\frac{n}{2}$ or $n+2 = 2n$ or $n+2 = \\frac{n}{2}$ or $2n = \\frac{n}{2}$. However, we can quickly see that the only possible case is $n+2=2n$, which gives us $n=2$. We need to check if $n=2$ satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n## Step 4:  When $n=2$, the set $*(2)$ indeed contains three distinct elements: $\\{0, 4, 2\\}$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we consider the case where $n$ is odd. If $n$ is odd, then the set $*(n)$ contains the elements $\\{n-2, n+2, 2n, \\frac{n}{2}\\}$. For $*(n)$ to have exactly three distinct elements, we must have $n-2 = n+2$ or $n-2 = 2n$ or $n-2 = \\frac{n}{2}$ or $n+2 = 2n$ or $n+2 = \\frac{n}{2}$ or $2n = \\frac{n}{2}$. However, we can quickly see that the only possible cases are $n-2=2n$ or $n+2=2n$, which give us $n=-4$ or $n=4$. We need to check if these values satisfy the conditions of the problem.\n## Step 6:  When $n=-4$, the set $*(-4)$ contains three distinct elements: $\\{-6, 2, -8, -2\\}$, which indeed satisfies the conditions of the problem. When $n=4$, the set $*(4)$ contains three distinct elements: $\\{2, 6, 8, 2\\}$, but this set does not satisfy the condition of containing exactly three distinct elements.\n## Step 7:  Next, we consider the case $n-2=\\frac{n}{2}$. This equation reduces to $n=4$. So, we need to check if $n=4$ satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n## Step 8:  When $n=4$, the set $*(4)$ contains three distinct elements: $\\{2, 6, 8, 2\\}$, but this set does not satisfy the condition of containing exactly three distinct elements.\n## Step 9:  Now, we consider the case $n+2=\\frac{n}{2}$. This equation reduces to $n=-4$. We have already checked that $n=-4$ satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n## Step 10:  Next, we consider the case $2n=\\frac{n}{2}$. This equation reduces to $n=0$. We need to check if $n=0$ satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n## Step 11:  When $n=0$, the set $*(0)$ contains three distinct elements: $\\{-2, 2, 0, 0\\}$, but this set does not satisfy the condition of containing exactly three distinct elements.\n## Step 12:  Finally, we consider the case $n-2=2n$. This equation reduces to $n=-4$, and we have already checked that $n=-4$ satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n## Step 13:  Now, we consider the case $n+2=2n$. This equation reduces to $n=4$, but we have already checked that $n=4$ does not satisfy the conditions of the problem.\n## Step 14:  Now, we consider the case $n-2=\\frac{n}{2}$. This equation reduces to $n=4$, but we have already checked that $n=4$ does not satisfy the conditions of the problem.\n## Step 15:  Finally, we consider the case $n+2=\\frac{n}{2}$. This equation reduces to $n=-4$, and we have already checked that $n=-4$ satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n## Step 16:  After analyzing all the cases, we have found that only two values of $n$ satisfy the conditions of the problem: $n=2$ and $n=-4$.\n## Step 17:  Therefore, the number of distinct integers $n$ for which the set $*(n)$ has exactly three distinct elements is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
