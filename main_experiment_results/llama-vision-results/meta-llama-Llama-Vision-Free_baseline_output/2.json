    "problem": "We flip a fair coin 10 times.  What is the probability that we get heads in at least 6 of the 10 flips?",
    "solution": "There are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible outcomes of the 10 coin flips. The probability that we flip at least 6 heads is equal to the probability that we flip at least 6 tails, by symmetry.  Let's call this probability $p$.  The only other possibility is that we flip exactly 5 heads and 5 tails, for which the probability is $\\dfrac{\\binom{10}{5}}{2^{10}} = \\dfrac{252}{1024} = \\dfrac{63}{256}$.  Therefore, $\\dfrac{63}{256} + 2p = 1$, giving $$ p=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{63}{256}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{193}{512}} $$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of outcomes for 10 coin flips.\nThe total number of outcomes for 10 coin flips can be calculated using the formula $2^n$, where n is the number of flips. In this case, $2^{10} = 1024$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the number of successful outcomes for getting heads in at least 6 of the 10 flips.\nTo get the number of successful outcomes, we need to calculate the number of ways to get 6 heads, 7 heads, 8 heads, 9 heads, and 10 heads, and then sum these values. We can use the binomial coefficient formula $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where n is the total number of flips (10), and k is the number of heads.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to get 6 heads.\n$\\binom{10}{6} = \\frac{10!}{6!(10-6)!} = \\frac{10!}{6!4!} = 210$\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to get 7 heads.\n$\\binom{10}{7} = \\frac{10!}{7!(10-7)!} = \\frac{10!}{7!3!} = 120$\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to get 8 heads.\n$\\binom{10}{8} = \\frac{10!}{8!(10-8)!} = \\frac{10!}{8!2!} = 45$\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to get 9 heads.\n$\\binom{10}{9} = \\frac{10!}{9!(10-9)!} = \\frac{10!}{9!1!} = 10$\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of ways to get 10 heads.\n$\\binom{10}{10} = \\frac{10!}{10!(10-10)!} = \\frac{10!}{10!0!} = 1$\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total number of successful outcomes.\nAdd up the number of ways to get 6 heads, 7 heads, 8 heads, 9 heads, and 10 heads: $210 + 120 + 45 + 10 + 1 = 386$\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the probability of getting heads in at least 6 of the 10 flips.\nThe probability is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: $\\frac{386}{1024}$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the fraction to get the final probability.\n$\\frac{386}{1024} = \\frac{193}{512}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{193}{512}}$"
