For example, if Annie arrived at 2:00, Xenas could arrive at any time between 2:00 and 2:45 and see Annie at the party.  Let one hour equal one unit.  Then, we can calculate the area of the shaded region as the area of the entire square minus the areas of the two unshaded triangles.  This equals $$2\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4}=\\frac{25}{16}.$$ So the area of the shaded region is $$4-\\frac{25}{16}=\\frac{64-25}{16}= \\frac{39}{16}.$$ Since the area of the square is 4, the probability that Annie and Xenas see each other at the party is $$\\dfrac{39/16}{4} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{39}{64}}.$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the possible time intervals in which Annie and Xenas can meet at the party. Given that they arrive at random times between 2:00 and 4:00, we can represent their arrival times on a coordinate plane, with Annie's arrival time on the x-axis and Xenas' arrival time on the y-axis.\n## Step 2:  We are interested in the shaded region where the two overlapping squares represent the time intervals during which Annie and Xenas can meet. The first square represents the 45-minute stay of Annie, and the second square represents the 45-minute stay of Xenas.\n## Step 3:  To calculate the probability of Annie and Xenas seeing each other at the party, we need to find the area of the shaded region and divide it by the total area of the square representing possible arrival times, which is 1.\n## Step 4:  The area of the shaded region can be calculated by subtracting the areas of the two unshaded triangles from the total area of the square. Each triangle has a base and height of 1.2 (45 minutes), and the area of each triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(1.2)(1.2) = 0.72$. Therefore, the total area of the shaded region is $1 - 2(0.72) = 0.56$.\n## Step 5:  The probability that Annie and Xenas see each other at the party is then given by the ratio of the area of the shaded region to the total area of the square, which is $\\frac{0.56}{1} = 0.56$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.56}$"
