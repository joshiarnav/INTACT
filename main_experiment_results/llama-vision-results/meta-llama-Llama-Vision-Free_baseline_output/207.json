    "problem": "Tina randomly selects two distinct numbers from the set $$\\{1,2,3,4,5\\},$$and Sergio randomly selects a number from the set $$\\{1,2,\\ldots,10\\}.$$What is the probability that Sergio's number is larger than the sum of the two numbers chosen by Tina?",
    "solution": "There are ten ways for Tina to select a pair of numbers. The sums 9, 8, 4, and 3 can be obtained in just one way, and the sums 7, 6, and 5 can each be obtained in two ways. The probability for each of Sergio's choices is $1/10$. Considering his selections in decreasing order, the total probability of Sergio's choice being greater is \\begin{align*}\n&\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)\\left(1 + \\frac{9}{10} + \\frac{8}{10} +\n\\frac{6}{10} + \\frac{4}{10} + \\frac{2}{10} + \\frac{1}{10} + 0 + 0 + 0\n\\right) \\\\\n& = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider all the possible combinations of numbers that Tina and Sergio can select, and then determine the probability that Sergio's number is larger than the sum of the two numbers chosen by Tina.\n## Step 2:  Tina is choosing two distinct numbers from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, which means there are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ possible combinations of numbers that Tina can choose.\n## Step 3:  Sergio, on the other hand, is choosing a number from the set $\\{1,2,\\ldots,10\\}$, which gives him $10$ possible choices.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is the product of Tina's choices and Sergio's choices, which is $10 \\times 10 = 100$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we need to find the number of outcomes in which Sergio's number is larger than the sum of the two numbers chosen by Tina.\n## Step 6:  We will consider the possible sums of Tina's two numbers, which can range from $3$ to $9$.\n## Step 7:  For the sum of $3$, there are $1$ ways for Tina to choose the numbers $(1,2)$, and Sergio needs to choose a number greater than $3$, so there are $7$ choices for Sergio.\n## Step 8:  For the sum of $4$, there are $3$ ways for Tina to choose the numbers $(1,3)$, $(2,2)$, and $(3,1)$, but since $2$ cannot be chosen twice, there are only $2$ valid combinations. Sergio needs to choose a number greater than $4$, so there are $7$ choices for him.\n## Step 9:  For the sum of $5$, there are $3$ ways for Tina to choose the numbers $(1,4)$, $(2,3)$, and $(3,2)$, but again, since $2$ cannot be chosen twice, there are only $2$ valid combinations. Sergio needs to choose a number greater than $5$, so there are $6$ choices for him.\n## Step 10:  For the sum of $6$, there are $2$ ways for Tina to choose the numbers $(1,5)$ and $(2,4)$, $(3,3)$, but since $3$ cannot be chosen twice, there is only $1$ valid combination. Sergio needs to choose a number greater than $6$, so there are $5$ choices for him.\n## Step 11:  For the sum of $7$, there is $1$ way for Tina to choose the numbers $(1,6)$, $(2,5)$, $(3,4)$, but since $4$ cannot be chosen twice, there is only $1$ valid combination. Sergio needs to choose a number greater than $7$, so there are $4$ choices for him.\n## Step 12:  For the sum of $8$, there is $1$ way for Tina to choose the numbers $(1,7)$, $(2,6)$, $(3,5)$, $(4,4)$, but since $4$ cannot be chosen twice, there is only $1$ valid combination. Sergio needs to choose a number greater than $8$, so there are $3$ choices for him.\n## Step 13:  For the sum of $9$, there is $1$ way for Tina to choose the numbers $(1,8)$, $(2,7)$, $(3,6)$, $(4,5)$, but since $5$ cannot be chosen twice, there is only $1$ valid combination. Sergio needs to choose a number greater than $9$, so there are $2$ choices for him.\n## Step 14:  Therefore, the total number of outcomes where Sergio's number is larger than the sum of the two numbers chosen by Tina is $7+7+6+5+4+3+2=34$.\n## Step 15:  The probability that Sergio's number is larger than the sum of the two numbers chosen by Tina is then $\\frac{34}{100} = \\boxed{\\frac{17}{50}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{50}}$"
