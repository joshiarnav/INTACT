    "problem": "In a math class of 30 students, 12 out of 15 girls are freshmen and 11 out of 15 boys are freshmen. What is the probability that in a randomly selected group of five students from the class, there will be two freshmen girls and three freshmen boys? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest thousandth.",
    "solution": "We can choose 2 freshmen girls and 3 freshman boys in $\\binom{12}{2}\\binom{11}{3} = 10890$ ways.  There are a total of $\\binom{30}{5} = 142506$ possible groups of 5 students we can choose.  Thus the probability of selecting a group of 5 students with 2 freshman girls and 3 freshmen boys is $\\frac{10890}{142506} \\approx \\boxed{0.076}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of freshmen girls\nThere are 15 girls in the class, and 12 out of 15 are freshmen. So the number of freshmen girls is 12.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of freshmen boys\nThere are 15 boys in the class, and 11 out of 15 are freshmen. So the number of freshmen boys is 11.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of ways to select 5 students from 30\nThe total number of ways to select 5 students from 30 is calculated using combinations. We use the formula C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of students and r is the number of students to be selected. In this case, n = 30 and r = 5. So, C(30, 5) = 30! / (5!(30-5)!) = 142,506.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to select 2 freshmen girls from 12\nThe number of ways to select 2 freshmen girls from 12 is calculated using combinations. We use the formula C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the number of freshmen girls and r is the number of freshmen girls to be selected. In this case, n = 12 and r = 2. So, C(12, 2) = 12! / (2!(12-2)!) = 66.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to select 3 freshmen boys from 11\nThe number of ways to select 3 freshmen boys from 11 is calculated using combinations. We use the formula C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the number of freshmen boys and r is the number of freshmen boys to be selected. In this case, n = 11 and r = 3. So, C(11, 3) = 11! / (3!(11-3)!) = 165.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of ways to select 2 freshmen girls and 3 freshmen boys\nThe total number of ways to select 2 freshmen girls and 3 freshmen boys is the product of the number of ways to select 2 freshmen girls and the number of ways to select 3 freshmen boys. Total ways = C(12, 2) * C(11, 3) = 66 * 165 = 10,890.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability\nThe probability is calculated by dividing the total number of ways to select 2 freshmen girls and 3 freshmen boys by the total number of ways to select 5 students from 30. Probability = Total ways / Total number of ways = 10,890 / 142,506.\n\n## Step 8: Express the probability as a decimal to the nearest thousandth\nThe probability is 0.0764 when rounded to the nearest thousandth.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.076}$"
