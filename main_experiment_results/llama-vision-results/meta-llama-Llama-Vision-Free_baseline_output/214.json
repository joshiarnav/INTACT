    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recognize that the expression involves factorials and the rules of arithmetic operations on factorials.\nTo simplify the given expression, we need to consider the properties of factorials and how arithmetic operations affect them. The factorial of a number n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the rules of factorials to the given expression.\nWe have $(x + 1 - x)! \\div (x-x + 1)!$. Simplifying inside the parentheses, we get $1! \\div 1!$.\n\n## Step 3: Recall the value of 1!.\nSince 1! (1 factorial) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 1, it equals $1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the expression $1! \\div 1!$.\nUsing the value of 1! from step 3, we calculate $1! \\div 1! = 1 \\div 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression.\nThe expression $1 \\div 1$ simplifies to 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
