    "problem": "Fruit salad can be made with any $3$ of these $5$ fruits: apples, bananas, grapes, strawberries, and pineapples. If strawberries and pineapples do not taste good together and grapes and bananas do not look appetizing together, how many possible good tasting and appetizing salads are there?",
    "solution": "The number of combinations of fruit possible is $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$. However, if strawberries and pineapples cannot go together, that decreases the number of combinations by three (because they could be paired with apples, grapes, or bananas). Similarly, if grapes and bananas cannot go together, the number of combinations is reduced by another three. Thus, $10 - 3 - 3 = \\boxed{4}$ such salads are possible.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of fruit salad combinations without any restrictions.\nWe can calculate this by using the combination formula, C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of fruits and k is the number of fruits in each salad. In this case, n = 5 and k = 3. So, C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 10.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of salads that include both strawberries and pineapples.\nIf we choose both strawberries and pineapples, we have 3 remaining fruits to choose from, and we need to choose 1 more fruit to make a salad. Using the combination formula, C(3, 1) = 3. So, there are 3 salads that include both strawberries and pineapples.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of salads that include both grapes and bananas.\nIf we choose both grapes and bananas, we have 3 remaining fruits to choose from, and we need to choose 1 more fruit to make a salad. Using the combination formula, C(3, 1) = 3. So, there are 3 salads that include both grapes and bananas.\n\n## Step 4: Subtract the number of salads that include both strawberries and pineapples, and the number of salads that include both grapes and bananas from the total number of fruit salad combinations.\nSince we cannot have both strawberries and pineapples together, and we cannot have both grapes and bananas together, we need to subtract the number of salads that include these pairs of fruits. Therefore, the total number of good tasting and appetizing salads is 10 - 3 - 3 = 4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
