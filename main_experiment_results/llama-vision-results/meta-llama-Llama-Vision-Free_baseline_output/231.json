    "problem": "Alex has four books of different sizes which he wishes to place on a bookshelf. Unfortunately, the bookshelf has a conspicuous hole at one end through which only the smallest book can fall. If he wishes for all his books to stay stationary, in how many ways can he arrange his books?",
    "solution": "The smallest book cannot be placed at one end, so there are three positions which it can occupy. The other books can each be placed in any of the three remaining positions, giving $3!$ arrangements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $3\\times3!=\\boxed{18\\text{ ways.}}$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We first recognize that since the hole in the bookshelf is only large enough for the smallest book to fall through, the smallest book must be placed at one end of the bookshelf.\n## Step 2:  Once the smallest book is placed at one end, there are three remaining books to be arranged. However, the second smallest book cannot be placed at the other end since the hole can only accommodate the smallest book.\n## Step 3:  So, the second smallest book must be placed next to the smallest book. We then have two remaining books to arrange in the two remaining spaces.\n## Step 4:  The first of these two remaining books can be placed in 2 ways since it can be either of the two larger books.\n## Step 5:  Once the first of the two remaining books is placed, the last book can only be placed in one way since the two remaining spots must be filled by the last two books.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, there are 2 ways to arrange the four books.\n## Step 7:  However, we also need to consider the fact that the books of different sizes can be arranged in different orders.\n## Step 8:  There are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the four books of different sizes.\n## Step 9:  Since there are 2 ways to arrange the books given the constraints of the hole in the bookshelf, the total number of arrangements is 2 * 24.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, there are a total of 48 ways for Alex to arrange his books on the bookshelf.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{48}$"
