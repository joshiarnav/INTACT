    "problem": "The positive five-digit integers that use each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 exactly once are ordered from least to greatest. What is the $50^{\\text{th}}$ integer in the list?",
    "solution": "We start with the numbers that start with 1.  There are 4 ways to pick the next digit, then 3 ways to pick the third digit, 2 ways to pick the fourth, and 1 to pick the last.  Therefore, there are $4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24$ integers with 1 as the first digit.  Similarly, another 24 have 2 as the first digit. That's 48 numbers so far, so we want the second smallest number that starts with 3.  The smallest is 31245, and the next smallest is $\\boxed{31254}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the task\nWe need to find the 50th integer from the list of positive five-digit integers that use each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 exactly once, in ascending order.\n\n## Step 2: Count the number of integers starting with 1, 2, and 3\nSince we have 5 numbers to arrange, there are $5! = 120$ possible arrangements of the numbers. We can start counting the number of integers by considering the number of arrangements starting with each digit.\n\n## Step 3: Count the number of integers starting with 1\nWhen the first digit is 1, we have 4 remaining digits to arrange, and there are $4! = 24$ possible arrangements of the remaining digits. So, there are 24 integers starting with 1.\n\n## Step 4: Count the number of integers starting with 2\nWhen the first digit is 2, we have 4 remaining digits to arrange, and there are $4! = 24$ possible arrangements of the remaining digits. So, there are 24 integers starting with 2.\n\n## Step 5: Count the number of integers starting with 3\nWhen the first digit is 3, we have 4 remaining digits to arrange, and there are $4! = 24$ possible arrangements of the remaining digits. So, there are 24 integers starting with 3.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of integers starting with 1, 2, and 3\nThe total number of integers starting with 1, 2, or 3 is $24 + 24 + 24 = 72$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of integers starting with 4\nSince we need to find the 50th integer, we can start counting from the numbers starting with 4. There are $4! = 24$ integers starting with 4.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the number of integers starting with 5\nSince we need to find the 50th integer and there are already 72 integers starting with 1, 2, or 3, and 24 integers starting with 4, there are $50-72-24 = 50-96$ integers that start with 5, but that cannot happen. Therefore, the 50th integer must start with 4.\n\n## Step 9: Find the 50-72=78th number that starts with 4, which will be the 50th integer.\nWe are looking for the 50th number which is greater than 72. We know that 24 numbers start with 4, and we need the 50th number, which will be the 78th number that starts with 4. The first number that starts with 4 is 41235.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the 50th integer\nWe need to find the 78th number that starts with 4. To do this, we can start with 41235 and arrange the remaining digits in ascending order until we reach the 78th number.\n\n## Step 11: Count the 78th number that starts with 4.\nThe first number that starts with 4 is 41235. The second number is 41325. The third number is 41425. The fourth number is 41523. The fifth number is 41532. The sixth number is 41523. The seventh number is 42153. The eighth number is 42315. The ninth number is 42351. The tenth number is 42513. The eleventh number is 42531. The twelfth number is 43125. The thirteenth number is 43152. The fourteenth number is 43215. The fifteenth number is 43251. The sixteenth number is 43512. The seventeenth number is 43521. The eighteenth number is 45213. The nineteenth number is 45231. The twentieth number is 45312. The twenty-first number is 45321. The twenty-second number is 41532. The twenty-third number is 41352. The twenty-fourth number is 41523. The twenty-fifth number is 41532. The twenty-sixth number is 41523. The twenty-seventh number is 42153. The twenty-eighth number is 42315. The twenty-ninth number is 42351. The thirtieth number is 42513. The thirty-first number is 42531. The thirty-second number is 43125. The thirty-third number is 43152. The thirty-fourth number is 43215. The thirty-fifth number is 43251. The thirty-sixth number is 43512. The thirty-seventh number is 43521. The thirty-eighth number is 45213. The thirty-ninth number is 45231. The fortieth number is 45312. The forty-first number is 45321. The forty-second number is 45132. The forty-third number is 45123. The forty-fourth number is 41523. The forty-fifth number is 41532. The forty-sixth number is 41523. The forty-seventh number is 42153. The forty-eighth number is 42315. The forty-ninth number is 42351. The fiftieth number is 42513.\n\n## Step 12: Determine the 50th integer.\nThe 50th integer is 42513.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{42513}$"
