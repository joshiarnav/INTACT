    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to compute the binomial coefficient $\\dbinom{15}{2}$, which represents the number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of 15 distinct items.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the formula for the binomial coefficient\nThe binomial coefficient can be calculated using the formula: $\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n!$ denotes the factorial of $n$, which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$. In our case, $n=15$ and $k=2$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the factorials\nTo apply the formula, we need to calculate the factorials involved. The factorial of a number $n$ is denoted as $n!$ and is calculated as $n! = n \\times (n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times ... \\times 2 \\times 1$. So, we need to calculate $15!$, $2!$, and $(15-2)! = 13!$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate 15!\n$15! = 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 1307674368000$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate 2!\n$2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate 13!\n$13! = 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6227020800$.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the formula\nNow that we have calculated the factorials, we can apply the formula: $\\dbinom{15}{2} = \\dfrac{15!}{2!(15-2)!} = \\dfrac{1307674368000}{2 \\times 6227020800}$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the fraction\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: $\\dbinom{15}{2} = \\dfrac{1307674368000}{2 \\times 6227020800} = \\dfrac{1307674368000}{12454041600}$.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the fraction further\nWe can simplify the fraction further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. However, we notice that we can simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 2, which gives us: $\\dbinom{15}{2} = \\dfrac{1307674368000}{2 \\times 6227020800} = \\dfrac{653837184000}{12454041600}$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the fraction further\nWe can simplify the fraction further by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1245404160.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the simplified fraction\n$\\dbinom{15}{2} = \\dfrac{653837184000}{12454041600} = 52.5$ is incorrect, we need to reevaluate this step\n\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the simplified fraction\nWe can simplify the fraction further by dividing the numerator and denominator by 1245404160, which is the greatest common divisor. However, we also notice that $\\dfrac{1307674368000}{2 \\times 6227020800}$ is actually $\\dfrac{1307674368000}{12454041600}$ which simplifies to $\\dfrac{1307674368000 / 1245404160}{1245404160 / 1245404160}$. $\\dfrac{1307674368000 / 1245404160}{1245404160 / 1245404160}$ simplifies to $\\dfrac{10485760}{1008}$, then to $\\dfrac{1048576}{105}$, which is equal to 9980 or $\\dfrac{9960}{1}$ is not, however  $\\dfrac{1048576}{105}$ which is the same as $\\dfrac{1048576}{105}$ or $\\dfrac{1048576/105}{1}$ which is the same as $\\dfrac{9984}{1}$ which is the same as 9984 / 1 = 9984.\n\n\n\n## Step 13: Calculate the correct value\n$\\dbinom{15}{2} = \\dfrac{1307674368000}{2 \\times 6227020800} = \\dfrac{1307674368000}{12454041600}$ simplifies to $\\dfrac{1307674368000 / 1245404160}{1245404160 / 1245404160}$ which is equal to $\\dfrac{1048576}{105}$ which is equal to 9984.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{105}$"
