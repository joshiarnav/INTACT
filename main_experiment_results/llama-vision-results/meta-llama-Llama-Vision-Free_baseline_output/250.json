    "problem": "Link is coloring a triforce, which consists of four equilateral triangles and is depicted below. He has three colors to use: gold, black, and green. So that it remains recognizable, he doesn't want to color any two triangles the same color if they share a side. How many different ways can he color the triforce? (Two colorings that differ by rotation are considered distinct.) [asy]\nsize(50);\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(1,1.732)--cycle);\ndraw((1,0)--(1.5,.866)--(.5,.866)--cycle);\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "There are 3 ways to choose a color for the center.  Once the center color is chosen, for each of the remaining triangles there are 2 ways to choose a color (any color except the center color).  Therefore, there are $3\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2 = \\boxed{24}$ ways to color the triforce.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are asked to determine the number of different ways Link can color the triforce, which consists of four equilateral triangles, using three colors - gold, black, and green.\n## Step 2:  The condition is that no two triangles that share a side can be colored the same color.\n## Step 3:  Let's start by examining the central triangle. Since it shares sides with three other triangles, all of its sides must be of different colors. This means the central triangle can be colored in 6 ways (3 choices for the first side, 2 for the second, and 1 for the last).\n## Step 4:  Once the central triangle is colored, the three surrounding triangles can be colored in only one way each. The color of the central triangle forces the colors of the surrounding triangles, as they share a side with the central triangle.\n## Step 5:  However, we have to consider the rotational symmetry of the triforce. Any rotation of the triforce will result in the same coloring, so we need to account for this when calculating the total number of distinct colorings.\n## Step 6:  Since there are 6 different ways to color the central triangle, but these are overcounted by a factor of 6 due to the rotational symmetry, we need to divide by 6 to get the actual number of distinct colorings.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the total number of distinct ways to color the triforce is $\\frac{6}{6} = \\boxed{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
