    "problem": "A row of 8 light switches controls different banks of lights in a school gymnasium. In preparation for a school dance, students decide that they want either one or two banks of lights on during the dance. How many possible ways are there of setting these 8 switches so that either one or two banks of lights are on?",
    "solution": "There are two cases here. If one bank of lights is on, there are $\\binom{8}{1}=8$ ways to choose which bank of lights it is. If two banks of lights are on, there are $\\binom{8}{2}=28$ ways to choose which banks of lights they are. The total number of valid settings is $8+28=\\boxed{36}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand that each switch corresponds to a bank of lights, and the students want either one or two banks of lights to be on during the dance.\n## Step 2:  First, we calculate the number of ways to choose 1 bank of lights out of the 8 switches. This can be done using the combination formula, which is nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to choose.\n## Step 3:  So, to choose 1 bank out of 8, we have 8C1 = 8! / (1!(8-1)!) = 8 ways.\n## Step 4:  Next, we calculate the number of ways to choose 2 banks of lights out of the 8 switches. Using the combination formula, we have 8C2 = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 28 ways.\n## Step 5:  Now, to find the total number of ways to set the switches so that either one or two banks of lights are on, we simply add the number of ways to choose 1 bank and the number of ways to choose 2 banks.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the total number of ways is 8 (choosing 1 bank) + 28 (choosing 2 banks) = 36.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$"
