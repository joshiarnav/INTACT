    "problem": "Joan tries to solve a really hard problem once each day.  She has a 1/4 probability of solving it each day.  What is the probability that she will solve it before her sixth try?",
    "solution": "We must find the probability that Joan can solve it at any time before the sixth try, so it is the sum of the probabilities that she will solve it on her first, second, third, fourth, and fifth tries.  We could evaluate all those cases, but seeing all that casework, we wonder if it will be easier to find the probability that she fails to solve it before 6 tries, and subtract the result from 1.\n\nIn order for her to fail to solve it before her sixth try, she must fail 5 times.  The probability of failure on each try is $1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$, so the probability that she fails on each of her first 5 tries is $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^5 = \\frac{243}{1024}$.  Therefore, the probability that she succeeds before her sixth try is \\[1-\\frac{243}{1024} = \\boxed{\\frac{781}{1024}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of days Joan will try to solve the problem.\nJoan tries to solve the problem once each day until she solves it. We are interested in the probability of her solving it before her sixth try, meaning she could try it 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability that she will solve it on the first day.\nThe probability that Joan will solve the problem on the first day is 1/4.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability that she will solve it on the second day if she did not solve it on the first day.\nThe probability that she will not solve it on the first day is 1 - (1/4) = 3/4. The probability that she will solve it on the second day is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that she will solve it on the third day if she did not solve it on the first two days.\nThe probability that she will not solve it on the first two days is (3/4)^2 = 9/16. The probability that she will solve it on the third day is (9/16) * (1/4) = 9/64.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that she will solve it on the fourth day if she did not solve it on the first three days.\nThe probability that she will not solve it on the first three days is (3/4)^3 = 27/64. The probability that she will solve it on the fourth day is (27/64) * (1/4) = 27/256.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability that she will solve it on the fifth day if she did not solve it on the first four days.\nThe probability that she will not solve it on the first four days is (3/4)^4 = 81/256. The probability that she will solve it on the fifth day is (81/256) * (1/4) = 81/1024.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total probability that she will solve it before her sixth try.\nThe total probability that she will solve the problem before her sixth try is the sum of the probabilities of her solving it on each of the first five days.\n\n## Step 8: Sum the probabilities calculated in Steps 2-6.\nThe total probability that Joan will solve the problem before her sixth try is 1/4 + 3/16 + 9/64 + 27/256 + 81/1024.\n\n## Step 9: Find the common denominator for the fractions.\nTo add the fractions in Step 8, we need a common denominator, which is 1024.\n\n## Step 10: Convert each fraction to have the common denominator.\n1/4 = 256/1024, 3/16 = 192/1024, 9/64 = 144/1024, 27/256 = 81/1024.\n\n## Step 11: Add the fractions.\n256/1024 + 192/1024 + 144/1024 + 81/1024 + 81/1024 = 654/1024.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the fraction.\nWe should try to simplify the fraction 654/1024 by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator. However, simplifying the fraction or calculating the decimal is not necessary for the final answer as the question only asks for the probability in a fraction form.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{654}{1024}}$"
