    "problem": "Suppose that we win $\\$3$ if we flip a heads on a coin toss, but lose $\\$2$ if we flip tails.  What is the expected value, in dollars, of our winnings after one flip?",
    "solution": "In one flip, we have a $1/2$ chance of getting heads and winning 3 dollars, and a $1/2$ chance of getting tails and losing two dollars.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\$3) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\$2) = \\boxed{\\$0.50}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the possible outcomes of the coin toss.\nThe possible outcomes are heads (H) and tails (T).\n\n## Step 2: Assign the respective winnings to each outcome.\nWe win $\\$3$ if the outcome is heads, and we lose $\\$2$ if the outcome is tails.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of each outcome.\nSince the coin toss is fair, the probability of heads (H) is $\\frac{1}{2}$ and the probability of tails (T) is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the expected value of our winnings after one flip.\nThe expected value is calculated by multiplying the probability of each outcome by its respective winnings and then summing those products. Hence, the expected value is: $(\\frac{1}{2})(\\$3) + (\\frac{1}{2})(-\\$2)$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression for the expected value.\n$(\\frac{1}{2})(\\$3) + (\\frac{1}{2})(-\\$2) = \\frac{\\$3}{2} - \\frac{\\$2}{2} = \\frac{\\$1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.5}$"
