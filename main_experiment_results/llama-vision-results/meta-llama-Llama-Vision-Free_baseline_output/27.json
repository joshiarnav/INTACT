    "problem": "How many five-digit zip codes exist such that each of the first three digits is greater than 4?",
    "solution": "There are five digits greater than $4$ (5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), and each of the first three zip code digits could be any of them. Hence, there are $5\\cdot 5\\cdot 5 = 125$ ways to choose the first three digits. The last two zip code digits have no restrictions, so there are $10 \\cdot 10 = 100$ ways to choose them. Thus, there are $125 \\cdot 100 = \\boxed{12500}$ such zip codes.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the range for the first digit\nSince the first digit of the zip code must be greater than 4, it can range from 5 to 9, inclusive. This gives us 5 possibilities for the first digit.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the range for the second digit\nThe second digit also must be greater than 4, so it can range from 5 to 9, inclusive. Similar to the first digit, this gives us 5 possibilities for the second digit.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the range for the third digit\nFollowing the same logic as the first two digits, the third digit must be greater than 4 and can range from 5 to 9, inclusive. This also gives us 5 possibilities for the third digit.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the range for the fourth and fifth digits\nThe fourth and fifth digits have no restrictions given in the problem and can range from 0 to 9, inclusive. This gives us 10 possibilities for each of the fourth and fifth digits.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of five-digit zip codes\nTo find the total number of five-digit zip codes, we multiply the number of possibilities for each digit together: the 5 possibilities for the first digit, the 5 for the second, the 5 for the third, and the 10 for both the fourth and fifth digits.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total\n\\[ 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 5^3 \\times 10^2 = 125 \\times 100 = 12500 \\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12500}$"
