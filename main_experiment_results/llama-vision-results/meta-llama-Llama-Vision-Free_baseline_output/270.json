    "problem": "If two standard six-sided dice are tossed, what is the probability that a 5 is rolled on at least one of the two dice? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle for this problem. The probability of getting a 5 on the first roll is obviously $\\frac{1}{6}$, as it is on the second roll. So, the probability of getting a 5 on at least one of the rolls would appear to be $2\\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$. But this is not quite right. We have double counted the case of rolling a 5 twice. In that instance, we have included it in both the count for a 5 on the first roll and the second roll, when it only should have been included once overall. So, our answer is $\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{36} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a 5 on one die\nThere are 6 possible outcomes when rolling one six-sided die. Only one of those outcomes, which is rolling a 5, meets the condition of interest. Therefore, the probability of rolling a 5 on one die is 1/6.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of not rolling a 5 on one die\nSince there are 5 outcomes that do not meet the condition of interest (rolling a 5) when rolling one six-sided die out of 6 possible outcomes, the probability of not rolling a 5 on one die is 5/6.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability that neither of the two dice shows a 5\nTo calculate the probability that neither of the two dice shows a 5, we need to multiply the probability of not rolling a 5 on one die by itself, as the rolls of the two dice are independent events. Therefore, the probability that neither of the two dice shows a 5 is (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that at least one of the two dice shows a 5\nThe probability that at least one of the two dice shows a 5 is equal to 1 minus the probability that neither of the two dice shows a 5. Therefore, the probability that at least one of the two dice shows a 5 is 1 - 25/36 = 11/36.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}$"
