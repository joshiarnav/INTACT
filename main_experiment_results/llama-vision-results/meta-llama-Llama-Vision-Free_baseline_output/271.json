    "problem": "Amy was born on a Tuesday. What is the probability that exactly two of her three best friends were also born on Tuesday? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Since her friends' birthdays are completely independent of her own, each of them has a $\\frac{1}{7}$ probability of being born on a Tuesday, and a $1 - \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{6}{7}$ probability of not being born on a Tuesday. If exactly 2 friends were born on a Tuesday, the probability of this occurring is ${3 \\choose 2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{6}{7} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{6}{343} = \\boxed{\\frac{18}{343}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Let's start by considering the total number of outcomes when it comes to the birthdays of Amy's three best friends. Since each friend can be born on any day of the week, there are $7$ possible days for each friend to be born.\n## Step 2:  Therefore, the total number of outcomes for the birthdays of Amy's three best friends is $7^3=343$.\n## Step 3:  Now, we want to find the number of outcomes in which exactly two of Amy's three best friends were born on Tuesday.\n## Step 4:  To calculate this, we first choose 2 out of the 3 friends to be born on Tuesday, which can be done in $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ ways.\n## Step 5:  For each of these choices, the remaining friend can be born on any of the remaining 6 days of the week, which gives us $6$ possibilities.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the number of outcomes in which exactly two of Amy's three best friends were born on Tuesday is $3 \\cdot 6 = 18$.\n## Step 7:  Finally, the probability that exactly two of Amy's three best friends were born on Tuesday is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, which is $\\frac{18}{343}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{18}{343}}$"
