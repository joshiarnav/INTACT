    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 8 beads of different colors on the vertices of a cube, if rotations of the cube (but not reflections) are considered the same?",
    "solution": "Consider one vertex of the cube. When the cube is rotated, there are 8 vertices which that vertex could end up at. At each of those vertices, there are 3 ways to rotate the cube onto itself with that vertex fixed. So, there are a total of $8\\cdot3=24$ ways to rotate a cube. There are $8!$ ways to arrange the beads, not considering rotations. Since the arrangements come in groups of 24 equivalent arrangements, the actual number of ways to arrange the beads is $8!/24=\\boxed{1680}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the problem\nWe have 8 beads of different colors that need to be placed on the vertices of a cube. The task is to find out how many distinct ways there are to do this, considering rotations of the cube but not reflections as the same.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the concept of rotations and its effect\nRotations of the cube include turning it around any of its axes (x, y, z axes or their combinations) by any angle that brings it into a position indistinguishable from the original. Since we are not considering reflections, the focus is on the cube's ability to rotate and still be considered in the same configuration.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of rotational symmetries of a cube\nA cube has 24 rotational symmetries, which include:\n- 6 faces (each can be rotated by 0 or 90 degrees)\n- 8 vertices (each can be rotated independently)\n- 12 edges (each can be rotated independently)\nHowever, when considering the placement of 8 distinct beads on the vertices, we only need to consider the rotations around the axes that pass through the center of the cube and the vertices.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of distinct arrangements\nSince we have 8 beads of different colors and the cube has 8 vertices, there are 8! ways to place the beads on the vertices if we were not considering rotations. However, because rotations are considered the same, we need to divide this number by the number of rotational symmetries to get the number of distinct arrangements.\n\n## Step 5: Divide by the number of rotational symmetries\nSince the cube has 24 rotational symmetries, and each rotation can bring the cube into a configuration indistinguishable from any other, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by 24 to account for the rotations.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final number of distinct arrangements\nWe divide 8! by 24 to find the number of distinct arrangements.\n\n8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40320\n\n40320 / 24 = 1680\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1680}$"
