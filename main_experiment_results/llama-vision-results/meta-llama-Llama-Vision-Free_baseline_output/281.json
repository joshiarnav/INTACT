    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem requires us to find the number of 9-step paths from point $E$ to point $G$ on a grid.\n## Step 2:  To solve this, we can think of each step as either moving right or moving down, and we need to take a total of 9 steps to reach point $G$.\n## Step 3:  Out of the 9 steps, we need to take 4 steps to the right and 5 steps down to reach point $G$ from point $E$.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, we need to choose 4 of the 9 steps to be 'right' (and the remaining 5 steps will naturally be 'down').\n## Step 5:  This can be calculated using combinations, as we need to choose 4 steps out of 9, which is denoted by $\\binom{9}{4}$ or $\\binom{9}{5}$.\n## Step 6:  The formula for combinations is given by $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n!$ represents the factorial of $n$, which is the product of all positive integers up to $n$.\n## Step 7:  Substituting $n=9$ and $k=4$ into the combination formula, we get $\\binom{9}{4} = \\frac{9!}{4!(9-4)!} = \\frac{9!}{4!5!}$.\n## Step 8:  Calculating the factorials, we get $9! = 362880$, $4! = 24$, and $5! = 120$.\n## Step 9:  Substituting these values into the formula, we get $\\binom{9}{4} = \\frac{362880}{24 \\cdot 120} = \\frac{362880}{2880} = 126$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{126}$ 9-step paths from $E$ to $G$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{126}$"
