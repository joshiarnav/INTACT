    "problem": "The wheel shown is spun twice, so that the numbers indicated by the pointer are randomly determined (with each number on the wheel being equally likely). The two numbers determined in this way are recorded. The first number is divided by 4, determining one of the remainders 1,2,3 marking the columns of the checkerboard shown. The second number is divided by 5, determining one of the remainders 1,2,3,4 marking the rows of the checkerboard. Finally, a checker is placed on the square where this column and row meet.

    "solution": "The first remainder is even with probability $2/6=1/3$ and odd with probability 2/3.  The second remainder is even with probability $3/6=1/2$ and odd with probability 1/2.  The parity of the first remainder and the parity of the second remainder are independent, since they're determined by separate spins of the wheel.\n\nThe shaded squares are those that indicate that both remainders are odd or both are even. Hence the square is shaded with probability \\[\n\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2} =\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\n\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks for the probability of placing a checker on a shaded square of the checkerboard after spinning a wheel twice.\n## Step 2:  We first note that the wheel has numbers from 1 to 9. This indicates that each number on the wheel is equally likely to be determined when the wheel is spun.\n## Step 3:  To calculate the probability, we need to find the total number of possible outcomes and the number of successful outcomes where the checker ends up on a shaded square.\n## Step 4:  We are told that the first number is divided by 4 to determine one of the remainders 1,2,3, marking the columns of the checkerboard, and the second number is divided by 5 to determine one of the remainders 1,2,3,4 marking the rows of the checkerboard.\n## Step 5:  To calculate the number of successful outcomes, we need to find the combinations of remainders from the division of the two numbers that lead to the checker being placed on a shaded square.\n## Step 6:  There are four shaded squares in the checkerboard, which are located at the positions where the column and row meet. We need to determine the combinations of remainders that lead to the checker being placed on these squares.\n## Step 7:  If the remainder when dividing by 4 is $1$ and the remainder when dividing by 5 is $4,$ or if the remainder when dividing by 4 is $2$ and the remainder when dividing by 5 is $1,$ or if the remainder when dividing by 4 is $3$ and the remainder when dividing by 5 is $2,$ then the checker will be on a shaded square.\n## Step 8:  Now we can calculate the probability based on the total number of outcomes and the number of successful outcomes.\n## Step 9:  The total number of possible outcomes can be calculated as $9 \\times 9 = 81$, since there are 9 possible numbers on the wheel for each spin.\n## Step 10:  The number of successful outcomes can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities for each of the successful combinations, which is calculated as $\\frac{1}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{3}{81}$.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the probability of the checker being placed on a shaded square is $\\frac{3}{81}$.\n\n## Step 12:  We have identified the successful combinations, calculated the total number of possible outcomes, and computed the probability.\n## Step 13:  Therefore, we can now calculate the final probability.\n\n## Step 14:  Probability = $\\frac{Number\\ of\\ successful\\ outcomes}{Total\\ number\\ of\\ possible\\ outcomes}$\n## Step 15:  Probability = $\\frac{3}{81}$\n## Step 16:  Probability = $\\frac{1}{27}$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{27}}$"
