    "problem": "Ben flips a fair nickel four times. What is the probability that Ben flips Head, Tail, Head, Tail, in that order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Since any given flip has equal probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of being a Head or a Tail, and all outcomes are equally likely, the precise sequence given is equal to $\\frac{1}{2^4} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the probability of getting a Head or Tail on a single flip\nThe probability of getting a Head on a flip is 1/2, and the probability of getting a Tail is also 1/2.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of the sequence Head, Tail, Head, Tail\nTo find the probability of the sequence Head, Tail, Head, Tail, we need to multiply the probabilities of each flip. Since each flip is independent, the probability of the sequence is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2).\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression for the probability of the sequence\n(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^4 = 1/16.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$"
