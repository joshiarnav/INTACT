    "problem": "How many positive three-digit numbers are not multiples of 7?",
    "solution": "It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \\times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $142 \\times 7 = 994$.  Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers which are multiples of 7.  There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-128 = \\boxed{772}$ three-digit numbers which are not multiples of 7.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the number of positive three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7, we first need to determine the total number of three-digit numbers.\n## Step 2:  The smallest three-digit number is 100 and the largest three-digit number is 999. So, the total number of three-digit numbers is $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$.\n## Step 3:  Now, we need to find how many of these three-digit numbers are multiples of 7. We know that the first three-digit multiple of 7 is 105, and the last three-digit multiple of 7 is 994.\n## Step 4:  To find the number of multiples of 7 within this range, we can use the formula for finding the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: $n = \\frac{{\\text{Last term} - \\text{First term}}}{\\text{Common difference}} + 1$.\n## Step 5:  Applying this formula, we get $n = \\frac{{994 - 105}}{7} + 1 = 128$.\n## Step 6:  Now that we know there are 128 three-digit multiples of 7, we can find the number of three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7 by subtracting this number from the total number of three-digit numbers.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the number of positive three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7 is $900 - 128 = \\boxed{772}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{772}$"
