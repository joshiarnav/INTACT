    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes?",
    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, the only thing we need to keep track of is how many balls are in each box.  In this case, we can just list the cases: we put either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 balls into the first box, and the rest into the second box.  Thus there are $\\boxed{5}$ ways to arrange 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem requires finding the number of ways to distribute 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the possibilities\nSince the balls are indistinguishable, the only factor that matters is how many balls are in each box. We can represent the distribution of balls into the boxes as pairs of numbers, where the first number represents the number of balls in the first box and the second number represents the number of balls in the second box.\n\n## Step 3: Enumerate the possibilities\nThe different distributions can be as follows:\n- (4, 0) represents all 4 balls in the first box, none in the second.\n- (3, 1) represents 3 balls in the first box and 1 in the second.\n- (2, 2) represents 2 balls in the first box and 2 in the second.\n- (1, 3) represents 1 ball in the first box and 3 in the second.\n- (0, 4) represents all 4 balls in the second box, none in the first.\n\n## Step 4: Count the possibilities\nThere are 5 distinct distributions as listed in step 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
