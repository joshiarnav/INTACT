    "problem": "How many positive integers less than or equal to 100 have a prime factor that is greater than 4?",
    "solution": "The easiest solution is to find the number of positive integers with only 2 and 3 as their prime factors. If the number has no factors of 3, the qualifying numbers are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6$ for 7 total. If there is one factor of 3, we have $2^0 \\cdot 3^1, 2^1 \\cdot 3^1, 2^2 \\cdot 3^1, 2^3 \\cdot 3^1, 2^4 \\cdot 3^1, 2^5 \\cdot 3^1$ for 6 total. With two factors of 3, we have $2^0 \\cdot 3^2, 2^1 \\cdot 3^2, 2^2 \\cdot 3^2, 2^3 \\cdot 3^2$ for 4 total. With three factors of 3, we have $2^0 \\cdot 3^3, 2^1 \\cdot 3^3$ for 2 total. Finally, $3^4$ gives us 1 more. So, there are $7+ 6+4+2+1 = 20$ positive integers less than or equal to 100 that have only 2 and 3 as prime factors. Therefore, there are $100-20 = \\boxed{80}$ positive integers less than or equal to 100 that have a prime factor greater than 4.",

This set includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 32, 36, 48, 64, 72, 96.\n\n## Step 3: Count the total numbers from Step 2\nThere are 17 numbers from Step 2.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total count of positive integers less than or equal to 100\nThe total count of positive integers less than or equal to 100 is 100.\n\n## Step 5: Subtract the count from Step 3 from the count from Step 4\nSubtract the count of numbers without prime factors greater than 4 (17) from the total count of positive integers less than or equal to 100 (100).\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{83}$"
