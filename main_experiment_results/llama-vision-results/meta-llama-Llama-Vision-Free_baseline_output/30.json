    "problem": "How many primes are in the row of Pascal's Triangle that starts with a $1$ followed by a $6$?",
    "solution": "If the row contains a $1$, then a $6$, then the binomial coefficients must be $\\binom{6}{0}$ and $\\binom{6}{1}$. All we need to check now are $\\binom{6}{2}$ and $\\binom{6}{3}$, since $\\binom{6}{0} = \\binom{6}{6}$, $\\binom{6}{1} = \\binom{6}{5}$ , and $\\binom{6}{2} = \\binom{6}{4}$. $\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{4! \\times 2!} = 15$, and $\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3! \\times 3!} = 20$. None of those is prime, so there are $\\boxed{0}$ prime numbers in the given row.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the number of primes in the row of Pascal's Triangle that starts with a $1$ followed by a $6$.\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we should first understand the structure of Pascal's Triangle. Each row starts and ends with the number $1$, and the other numbers in the row are the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the triangle.\n## Step 3:  The row that starts with a $1$ followed by a $6$ is actually the $7^{\\text{th}}$ row of Pascal's Triangle.\n## Step 4:  Next, we need to determine the values in this row. Using the combination formula, where the value in the $n^{\\text{th}}$ row and $r^{\\text{th}}$ position is given by $\\binom{n}{r}$, we can find the values in the $7^{\\text{th}}$ row.\n## Step 5:  Calculating these combinations, we get the row as $1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1$.\n## Step 6:  Our task now is to identify the prime numbers in this row. We know that a prime number is a number greater than $1$ that has no positive divisors other than $1$ and itself.\n## Step 7:  Examining the row, we can see that the only prime number in this row is $6$ is not prime, it's  $1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1$. The only prime number in this row is $1$ is not prime, but the number $6$ is not prime either, the numbers  $15, 20$ are not prime and the number $6$ is not prime. $\\boxed{2}$ is not in the row. I made an error. Let me re do the row $1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1$ and identify the prime numbers in this row. I see that the only prime in this row is $\\boxed{2}$ not in the row, then I see that the number $6$ is not prime. Then I see that the numbers $15, 20$ are not prime. Then I see that the number $1$ is not prime .There is no prime in this row.\n## Step 8:  Looking at the row $1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1$, I see that there are no prime numbers in this row.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the number of primes in the row of Pascal's Triangle that starts with a $1$ followed by a $6$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"
