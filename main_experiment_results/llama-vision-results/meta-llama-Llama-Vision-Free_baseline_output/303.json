    "problem": "Sarah wants to order a pizza with 2 different toppings. She has 9 different toppings to choose from. How many different pizzas could she order?",
    "solution": "There are 9 choices of toppings, and we need to choose 2 distinct toppings. This is represented by the number of 2-element subsets of a 9-element set. We use the binomial coefficient ${9 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{36}$ to compute this.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the nature of the problem\nThis is a combination problem because the order of the toppings does not matter.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the total number of toppings available\nSarah has 9 different toppings to choose from.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the number of toppings to be chosen\nSarah wants to order a pizza with 2 different toppings.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of combinations of 2 toppings from 9\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the combination formula\nPlugging the values into the combination formula, we get C(9, 2) = 9! / (2!(9-2)!) = 9! / (2!7!).\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the factorial expressions\n9! = 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, 2! = 2 * 1, and 7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.\n\n## Step 7: Cancel out the common terms in the numerator and the denominator\n9! / (2!7!) = (9 * 8 * 7!) / (2!7!), the 7! cancels out.\n\n## Step 8: Perform the remaining calculations\n(9 * 8) / (2 * 1) = 72 / 2 = 36.\n\n## Step 9: Provide the final answer\n36.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$"
