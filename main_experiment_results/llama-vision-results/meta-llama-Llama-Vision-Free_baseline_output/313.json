    "solution": "Since $x$ and $1/x$ are integers, we know that $x$ is an integer that divides 1 evenly.  Therefore, we must have $x = -1$ or $x = 1$. The same is true for $y$ and $z$. So, the possible sums are $3(-1) = -3$, $2(-1) + 1 = -1$, $2(1) + -1 = 1$ or $3(1) = 3$. So there are $\\boxed{4}$ possible values for the sum.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To start solving the problem, we first need to understand the given conditions. We are provided with the values of $x$, $\\frac{1}{x}$, $y$, $\\frac{1}{y}$, $z$, and $\\frac{1}{z}$, all of which are integers.\n## Step 2:  Let's consider the possible values of $x$, $y$, and $z$. Given that they are integers, each of them can either be positive, negative, or zero.\n## Step 3:  We know that $x$, $y$, and $z$ can be $-1$, $0$, or $1$. This means they can have three possible values each, resulting in $3^3 = 27$ total combinations.\n## Step 4:  Now, we need to find the distinct values of $x+y+z$. Since $x$, $y$, and $z$ can be $-1$, $0$, or $1$, the sum $x+y+z$ can take on any integer value from $-3$ to $3$.\n## Step 5:  To count the number of distinct values of $x+y+z$, we can enumerate the possibilities for each value within this range and identify the combinations that yield the same sum.\n## Step 6:  For example, we know that $x+y+z$ can take on the value $-3$ when $x=y=z=-1$. In a similar manner, we can list out all the combinations for each value from $-3$ to $3$.\n## Step 7:  After listing out all the possible combinations, we can observe that the same value of $x+y+z$ can be obtained from multiple combinations of $x$, $y$, and $z$.\n## Step 8:  For instance, the value $0$ can be obtained from the combinations $(-1, 0, 1)$, $(-1, 1, 0)$, and $(0, -1, 1)$, $(0, 1, -1)$, and $(1, -1, 0)$, $(1, 0, -1)$.\n## Step 9:  We need to count the distinct values that can be obtained from these combinations.\n## Step 10:  By carefully examining the possible combinations and their resulting sums, we can count the distinct values of $x+y+z$.\n## Step 11:  Let's count the distinct values of $x+y+z$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{37}$"
