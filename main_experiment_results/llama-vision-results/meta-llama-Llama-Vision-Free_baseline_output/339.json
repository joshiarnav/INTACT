    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the maximum number of intersection points that can be achieved when drawing four distinct circles in a plane.\n## Step 2:  Each pair of circles can intersect at a maximum of two points. Therefore, to maximize the number of intersection points, we should consider the maximum number of pairs of circles that can be formed.\n## Step 3:  Since we have four circles, the number of pairs can be calculated using the combination formula, denoted as $\\binom{n}{r}=\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$. Here, we want to choose 2 circles out of 4, so we have $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6$ pairs of circles.\n## Step 4:  Each pair of circles can intersect at a maximum of two points. Therefore, the maximum number of intersection points is the product of the number of pairs and the maximum intersection points per pair, which is $6 \\times 2 = 12$ points.\n## Step 5:  However, we have to consider the case where three circles intersect at a common point. This means that the maximum number of intersection points remains the same as before.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the maximum number of points where at least two of the circles intersect is $\\boxed{12}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
