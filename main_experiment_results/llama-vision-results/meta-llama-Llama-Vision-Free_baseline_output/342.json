    "problem": "There are seven wombats in a council. Three of them are hairy-nosed wombats, while the rest are all different species. If the hairy-nosed wombats are indistinguishable but the other wombats are, how many ways can the wombats seat themselves in a row?",
    "solution": "There are $7!$ ways to arrange all the wombats. However, because the order of the hairy-nosed wombats does not matter, we've overcounted by the number of ways to arrange those three wombats, or $3!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{7!}{3!}=\\boxed{840}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of wombats and the number of each species.\nThere are 7 wombats in total. 3 of them are hairy-nosed wombats, and the rest, which is 7 - 3 = 4, are of different species.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the conditions for seating the wombats.\nThe hairy-nosed wombats are indistinguishable from one another, meaning we cannot tell them apart, but the wombats of the other species are distinguishable from one another.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to seat the distinguishable wombats.\nSince there are 4 distinguishable wombats, the number of ways to arrange them is 4!.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to seat the indistinguishable wombats.\nSince there are 3 indistinguishable hairy-nosed wombats, the number of ways to arrange them is 3!.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the formula for permutations with indistinguishable objects.\nThe total number of ways to seat all the wombats is the product of the number of ways to seat the distinguishable wombats and the number of ways to seat the indistinguishable wombats, which is 4! * 3!.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the value of 4! * 3!.\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24, and 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6, so 4! * 3! = 24 * 6 = 144.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{144}$"
