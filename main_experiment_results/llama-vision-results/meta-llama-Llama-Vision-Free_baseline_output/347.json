    "problem": "How many unique diagonals can be drawn in a five-sided convex polygon?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ pairs of vertices.  Five of these pairs correspond to adjacent vertices, which when connected yield edges of the pentagon.  Connecting any one of the $10-5=\\boxed{5}$ remaining pairs of vertices yields a diagonal.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the formula for calculating the number of diagonals in a polygon\nThe formula for calculating the number of diagonals in an n-sided polygon is given by \\(d = \\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\\).\n\n## Step 2: Apply the formula to the five-sided polygon\nIn this case, the polygon is five-sided, so n = 5. Plug this value into the formula to calculate the number of diagonals.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the calculation\n\\[d = \\frac{5(5-3)}{2}\\]\n\\[d = \\frac{5(2)}{2}\\]\n\\[d = \\frac{10}{2}\\]\n\\[d = 5\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
