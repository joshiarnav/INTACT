    "problem": "In how many ways can 5 different keys be placed on a keychain?  (Two arrangements are considered the same if one can be rotated or flipped to be identical to the other.)",
    "solution": "There are $5!$ ways to place the keys on the keychain, but we must divide by 5 for rotational symmetry (5 rotations for each arrangement), and by 2 for reflectional symmetry (we can flip the keychain to get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{5!}{5 \\times 2} = \\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of arrangements without considering rotations or reflections.\nThere are 5 different keys, so there are 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 ways to arrange the keys without considering rotations or reflections.\n\n## Step 2: Account for rotational symmetry.\nSince the keychain can be rotated, each unique arrangement is counted 5 times (once for each position the keychain can be rotated to). Therefore, we divide the total number of arrangements by 5 to account for rotational symmetry. This gives us 120 / 5 = 24 unique arrangements.\n\n## Step 3: Account for reflection symmetry.\nThe keychain can also be flipped over, effectively creating another arrangement that is considered identical. To account for reflection symmetry, we divide the number of unique arrangements by 2. So, we have 24 / 2 = 12.\n\n## Step 4: Finalize the calculation.\nBy dividing the initial total number of arrangements by both the number of possible rotations and reflections, we find that there are 12 unique ways to arrange the keys on the keychain.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
