    "solution": "An odd sum requires either that  the first die is even and the second is odd or that the first die is odd and the second is even. The probability  is \\[\n\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}=\n\\frac{1}{9}+\\frac{4}{9}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}.\n\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the possible outcomes for each die\nEach die has 6 faces, but with repeated numbers. For the first die, the possible outcomes are 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, and for the second die, the possible outcomes are 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes when two dice are rolled\nWhen rolling two dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes for two dice is 6 * 6 = 36.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the conditions for the sum to be odd\nFor the sum of the two dice to be odd, one die must show an odd number and the other die must show an even number.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of outcomes where the first die shows an odd number and the second die shows an even number\nThe odd numbers on the first die are 1 and 3. The even numbers on the second die are 4 and 6. Therefore, the number of outcomes where the first die shows an odd number and the second die shows an even number is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of outcomes where the first die shows an even number and the second die shows an odd number\nThe even numbers on the first die are 2. The odd numbers on the second die are 5. Therefore, the number of outcomes where the first die shows an even number and the second die shows an odd number is 1 * 2 = 2.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of outcomes where the sum is odd\nThe total number of outcomes where the sum is odd is the sum of the outcomes where the first die shows an odd number and the second die shows an even number, and the outcomes where the first die shows an even number and the second die shows an odd number. Therefore, the total number of outcomes where the sum is odd is 4 + 2 = 6.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability that the sum will be odd\nThe probability that the sum will be odd is the total number of outcomes where the sum is odd divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability that the sum will be odd is 6 / 36 = 1/6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$"
