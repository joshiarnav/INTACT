    "problem": "Joe's batting average is .323.  (That is, he averages 0.323 hits per at bat.)  What is the probability that he will get three hits in three at-bats? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "Each of Joe's hits is independent of the others. That is, the probability for one hit does not change depending on whether he hit or missed the previous ball. So, to calculate the probability that he will get three hits in three at-bats, we simply cube $0.323$ to get $0.033$. Rounded to the nearest hundredth, this gives $\\boxed{0.03}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given information\nJoe's batting average is 0.323, which means he has a 32.3% chance of getting a hit in a single at-bat.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of at-bats\nThe problem states that we are considering three at-bats.\n\n## Step 3: Recognize the type of problem\nThis is a binomial probability problem, where each at-bat is a Bernoulli trial with a probability of success (getting a hit) of 0.323.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the number of successes\nWe are interested in the probability of Joe getting exactly 3 hits in 3 at-bats.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the binomial probability formula\nThe probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials, where the probability of success in each trial is p, is given by the binomial probability formula:\nP(X=k) = (nCk) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\nIn this case, n=3, k=3, and p=0.323.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the binomial coefficient\nThe binomial coefficient (nCk) is calculated as:\nnCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\nIn this case, nC3 = 3! / (3!(3-3)!) = 1.\n\n## Step 7: Plug in the values\nSubstituting the values into the binomial probability formula, we get:\nP(X=3) = (1) * (0.323)^3 * (1-0.323)^3\nP(X=3) = (0.323)^3 * (0.677)^3\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the probabilities\nEvaluating the probabilities, we get:\n(0.323)^3 \u2248 0.0339\n(0.677)^3 \u2248 0.3654\nThen, multiplying these values, we get:\n0.0339 * 0.3654 \u2248 0.0124\n\n## Step 9: Round the answer to the nearest hundredth\nRounding the calculated probability to the nearest hundredth, we get:\n0.0124 \u2248 0.01\n\nHowever, I made an error in the calculations. Let's redo the final multiplication:\n(0.323)^3 = 0.0339\n(0.677)^3 = 0.3654\nThe correct multiplication is:\n0.0339 * 0.3654 = 0.0124\nHowever, I made another mistake in rounding the original value of (0.323)^3 and the product itself. Let's redo the final step:\n(0.323)^3 = 0.0339 (this is actually 0.03353)\n(0.677)^3 = 0.3654 (this is actually 0.36507)\nThe correct multiplication is:\n0.03353 * 0.36507 = 0.01224\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.12}$"
