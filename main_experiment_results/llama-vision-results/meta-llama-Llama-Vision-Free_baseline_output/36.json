    "problem": "How many different three-digit odd numbers can be formed using the digits 3, 4, 5 and 6 if digits cannot be repeated?",
    "solution": "Begin by constructing the number from the units digit and working up to the hundreds digit. There are two possible choices for the units digit: $3$ and $5$ (since the number must be odd). Then, after choosing that digit, there are three possible choices for the tens digit ($4$, $6$, and the remaining odd digit), since digits cannot be repeated. Finally, there are then two possible choices for the hundreds digit. Thus, there are $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{12}$ such numbers that can be formed.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the requirements for a three-digit odd number.\nTo form a three-digit odd number, the units place must be an odd digit. From the given digits 3, 4, 5, and 6, the odd digits are 3 and 5.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of options for the units place.\nSince we have two odd digits (3 and 5) to choose from for the units place, there are 2 options.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of options for the hundreds place.\nAfter choosing a digit for the units place, there are three digits left to choose from for the hundreds place since we cannot repeat digits.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of options for the tens place.\nAfter choosing digits for the units and hundreds places, there are two digits left to choose from for the tens place since we cannot repeat digits.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the multiplication principle to find the total number of different three-digit odd numbers.\nTo find the total number of different three-digit odd numbers, we multiply the number of options for each place value: 2 (units place) * 3 (hundreds place) * 2 (tens place).\n\n## Step 6: Perform the multiplication to find the total number of different three-digit odd numbers.\n2 * 3 * 2 = 12\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
