    "problem": "For how many positive integer values of $n$ is $3^n$ a factor of $15!$?",
    "solution": "We first determine the largest positive integer value of $n$ such that $3^n | 15!$. We determine this by counting the number of factors of 3 in the product.  There are 5 multiples of 3 in the product, and there is one extra factor of 3 in 9, so there are a total of  $5+ 1 = \\boxed{6}$ factors of 3 in the product of the first 15 integers. So, for all $n$ between 1 and 6, inclusive, $3^n$ is a factor of 15!.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the prime factorization of 15!\nThe prime factorization of 15! is the product of the prime factors of all the numbers up to 15, each raised to their respective powers. We need to find the powers of 3 in this factorization.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the powers of 3 in 15!\nTo find the powers of 3 in 15!, we need to count the multiples of 3, 3^2, 3^3, and so on, up to 15. There are 5 multiples of 3, 1 multiple of 3^2, and 0 multiples of 3^3.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total power of 3 in 15!\nTo calculate the total power of 3 in 15!, we add the powers of 3 from each multiple: (5 * 1) + (1 * 2) = 7.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the number of positive integer values of n for which 3^n is a factor of 15!\nWe want to find the number of positive integers n for which 3^n is a factor of 15!. Since we found that the total power of 3 in 15! is 7, the possible values of n are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n## Step 5: Count the possible values of n\nThere are 3 possible values of n.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
