    "problem": "In a class of 28 students, the teacher selects four people at random to participate in a geography contest. What is the probability that this group of four students includes at least two of the top three geography students in the class? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We count the number of ways to choose a group of four students including at least two of the top three geography students.  This is just  $\\binom{3}{2}\\cdot \\binom{25}{2} + \\binom{3}{3}\\cdot\\binom{25}{1} = 925$, since we can choose either 2 or 3 of the top students to be in this group.  In all, there are $\\binom{28}{4} = 20475$ groups of four students.  Thus our desired probability is $\\frac{925}{20475} = \\boxed{\\frac{37}{819}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Calculate the total number of ways to select 4 students out of 28.\nTo find the total number of ways to choose 4 students out of 28, we use the combination formula, which is $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. Applying this formula, we get $\\binom{28}{4} = \\frac{28!}{4!(28-4)!}$.\n\n## Step 2:  Calculate the number of ways to choose 4 students such that there are no top three students in the group.\nWe need to find the number of ways to select 4 students from the remaining 25 students, who are not among the top three. Using the combination formula again, we get $\\binom{25}{4} = \\frac{25!}{4!(25-4)!}$.\n\n## Step 3:  Calculate the number of ways to choose 4 students such that there is exactly one top three student in the group.\nWe need to find the number of ways to select 1 student from the top three and 3 students from the remaining 25 students. Using the multiplication principle, we get $\\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{25}{3} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{25!}{3!(25-3)!}$.\n\n## Step 4:  Calculate the number of ways to choose 4 students such that there are exactly two top three students in the group.\nWe need to find the number of ways to select 2 students from the top three and 2 students from the remaining 25 students. Using the multiplication principle, we get $\\binom{3}{2} \\times \\binom{25}{2} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{25!}{2!(25-2)!}$.\n\n## Step 5:  Calculate the total number of successful outcomes.\nWe add the results of steps 3 and 4 to get the total number of successful outcomes. This gives us $\\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{25}{3} + \\binom{3}{2} \\times \\binom{25}{2}$.\n\n## Step 6:  Calculate the probability of selecting at least two top three students.\nThe probability is given by the ratio of the total number of successful outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. This gives us $\\frac{\\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{25}{3} + \\binom{3}{2} \\times \\binom{25}{2}}{\\binom{28}{4}}$.\n\n## Step 7:  Simplify the expression for the probability.\nSimplifying the expression, we get $\\frac{3 \\cdot \\frac{25!}{3!(25-3)!} + 3 \\cdot \\frac{25!}{2!(25-2)!}}{\\frac{28!}{4!(28-4)!}} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 2925 + 3 \\cdot 3003}{12650} = \\frac{3(2925 + 3003)}{12650} = \\frac{3(5928)}{12650} = \\frac{17784}{12650}$.\n\n## Step 8:  Reduce the fraction.\nWe can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 17784 and 12650 is 2.\n\n## Step 9:  Simplify the fraction.\n$\\frac{17784}{12650} = \\frac{17784 \\div 2}{12650 \\div 2} = \\frac{8892}{6330}$. We can simplify the fraction further.\n\n## Step 10:  Simplify the fraction.\n$\\frac{8892}{6330} = \\frac{8892 \\div 2}{6330 \\div 2} = \\frac{4446}{3165}$.\n\n## Step 11:  Simplify the fraction.\n$\\frac{4446}{3165} = \\frac{4446 \\div 3}{3165 \\div 3} = \\frac{1482}{1055}$.\n\n## Step 12:  Simplify the fraction.\n$\\frac{1482}{1055} = \\frac{1482 \\div 1}{1055 \\div 1} = \\frac{1482}{1055}$.\n\n## Step 13:  We need to find the greatest common divisor of 1482 and 1055.\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor.\n\n## Step 14:  Find the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.\n$1482 = 1055 \\cdot 1 + 427$, $1055 = 427 \\cdot 2 + 181$, $427 = 181 \\cdot 2 + 65$, $181 = 65 \\cdot 2 + 51$, $65 = 51 \\cdot 1 + 14$, $51 = 14 \\cdot 3 + 9$, $14 = 9 \\cdot 1 + 5$, $9 = 5 \\cdot 1 + 4$, $5 = 4 \\cdot 1 + 1$.\n\n## Step 15:  The greatest common divisor is 1.\nSince the greatest common divisor is 1, we cannot simplify the fraction further.\n\n## Step 16:  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{1482}{1055}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1482}{1055}}$"
