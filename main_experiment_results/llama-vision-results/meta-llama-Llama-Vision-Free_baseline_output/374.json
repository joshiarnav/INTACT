    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks us to compute the difference between two combinations, $\\dbinom{16}{4}$ and $\\dbinom{16}{12}$.\n## Step 2:  To approach this, we can use the property that $\\dbinom{n}{k}=\\dbinom{n}{n-k}$, where $\\dbinom{n}{k}$ represents the number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $n$ distinct items.\n## Step 3:  Using this property, we can rewrite $\\dbinom{16}{12}$ as $\\dbinom{16}{16-12}=\\dbinom{16}{4}$.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, the expression $\\dbinom{16}{4}-\\dbinom{16}{12}$ simplifies to $\\dbinom{16}{4}-\\dbinom{16}{4}$.\n## Step 5:  However, we are left with a subtraction of the same value, which equals $0$.\n## Step 6:  Hence, $\\dbinom{16}{4}-\\dbinom{16}{12}=0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"
