    "problem": "In how many ways can we seat 6 people at a round table if John and Sam insist on sitting next to each other? (Two seatings are equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "To take care of rotations, we can fix John at the topmost seat.  We then have two choices for Sam: either side of John. The other four may sit anywhere in the other four seats. Thus there are $2\\times 4! = \\boxed{48}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Consider John and Sam as a single unit\nSince John and Sam insist on sitting next to each other, we can treat them as a single unit. This means we have effectively reduced the number of people to be seated to 5 (the unit and the 4 other people).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the 5 units around the table\nWhen arranging people around a round table, we can fix one person's position as a reference point to avoid counting rotations as different arrangements. With 5 units (the John-Sam unit plus the 4 other people), there are (5-1)! = 4! = 24 ways to arrange them around the table.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to arrange John and Sam within their unit\nWithin the John-Sam unit, there are 2 possible arrangements: John on the left and Sam on the right, or Sam on the left and John on the right.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of arrangements\nTo find the total number of arrangements where John and Sam sit next to each other, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 5 units around the table by the number of ways to arrange John and Sam within their unit. This gives us 24 * 2 = 48.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{48}$"
