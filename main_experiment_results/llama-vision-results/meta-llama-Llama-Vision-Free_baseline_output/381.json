    "problem": "How many distinct three-letter sequences with at least one $``T\"$ can be formed by using three of the six letters of $TARGET?$ One such sequence is $``T-R-T.\"$",
    "solution": "We solve by casework.\n\n$\\bullet$ Case I: Exactly one T in the sequence. There are $3$ slots in which the $T$ could be placed. Then, there are $4$ choices $(A,$ $R,$ $G,$ or $E)$ for the second slot and $3$ for the third, giving a total of $3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = 36$ sequences.\n\n$\\bullet$ Case II: Exactly two Ts in the sequence. There are $3$ slots in which the non-$T$ can be placed, and there are $4$ possibilities for the letter choice. So, there are a total of $3 \\cdot 4 = 12$ such sequences.\n\nThus, there are $36 + 12 = \\boxed{48}$ possible sequences.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of distinct three-letter sequences without any restrictions.\nTo do this, we need to consider the number of choices for each letter position in the sequence. Since we are choosing from the six letters of the word TARGET, there are 6 choices for the first letter, 6 choices for the second letter, and 6 choices for the third letter. Multiplying these choices together gives us the total number of distinct sequences without any restrictions: $6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of distinct three-letter sequences with no $``T\"s.\nTo find the sequences that do not contain any $``T\"s, we consider only the remaining five letters (R, A, G, E, and R). There are 5 choices for the first letter, 5 choices for the second letter, and 5 choices for the third letter. Multiplying these choices together gives us the total number of distinct sequences with no $``T\"s: $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125$.\n\n## Step 3: Subtract the total number of distinct three-letter sequences with no $``T\"s from the total number of distinct sequences without any restrictions to find the number of sequences with at least one $``T\"$.\nThe difference between the total number of sequences without restrictions and the total number of sequences with no $``T\"s$ will give us the total number of sequences with at least one $``T\"$: $216 - 125 = 91$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{91}$"
