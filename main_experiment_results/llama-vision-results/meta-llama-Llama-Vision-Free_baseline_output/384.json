    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are asked to find the number of ways a 3-person committee can be chosen from a group of 8 people.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the type of problem\nThis is a combination problem, as the order of selection does not matter.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the combination formula\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of combinations\nWe need to calculate C(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 8! / (3!5!).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the factorial values\n8! = 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 40320,\n3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6,\n5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.\n\n## Step 6: Plug in the factorial values\nC(8, 3) = 40320 / (6 x 120) = 40320 / 720.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction\n40320 / 720 = 56.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{56}$"
