    "solution": "It takes 2 additional segments to create an additional triangle after the first. Since Figure $n$ has $n$ triangles, Figure 25 has 25 triangles. It takes 3 segments to create the first triangle and $2\\cdot24=48$ segments to create the 24 additional triangles, for a total of $3+48=\\boxed{51}$ segments.",

Thus, for n triangles, the total number of segments used is 3n.\n\n## Step 3: Find the number of triangles in Figure 25 of the sequence.\nSince Figure 1 contains 1 triangle, Figure 2 contains 2 triangles, and so on, the number of triangles in Figure 25 can be found by calculating 25.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of segments needed for Figure 25.\nSince each triangle requires 3 segments, we can find the total number of segments needed for Figure 25 by multiplying the number of triangles by 3.\n\n## Step 5: Use the pattern to determine the number of congruent segments required to make Figure 25.\nNumber of triangles in Figure 25 = 25\nNumber of segments in Figure 25 = Number of triangles * 3\nNumber of segments in Figure 25 = 25 * 3\n\n## Step 6: Perform the multiplication to determine the total number of congruent segments required.\nTotal number of segments = 25 * 3 = 75\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{75}$"
