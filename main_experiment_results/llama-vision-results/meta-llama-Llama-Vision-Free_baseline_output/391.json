    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the structure of Pascal's triangle\nPascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients where each number is the number of combinations of a certain size that can be selected from a set of items. It starts with a 1 at the top, then each row below has one more entry than the previous row.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the row in question\nThe row that starts with 1 and then 10 corresponds to the row whose values are the coefficients of the binomial expansion of $(x + y)^n$, where $n$ is the row number starting from 0 (the top row is considered row 0). The row we're interested in is row $n = 10$, since it starts with 1 and then 10.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the formula for a specific entry in Pascal's triangle\nThe $k$th entry in the $n$th row of Pascal's triangle, where the first entry is $k = 0$, can be calculated using the formula $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the next number in the row\nThe row we're examining is the 10th row (since it starts with $n=10$), and we know the first two numbers in this row are 1 and 10. We need to find the next number in this row.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the formula to find the third entry\nWe want to find $\\binom{10}{2}$ because the first entry is the 0th position and we are starting from $k = 0$, so the second entry is in the 1st position, and the third entry is in the 2nd position.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the value of $\\binom{10}{2}$\n$\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \\frac{10*9}{2} = 45$.\n\n## Step 7: Confirm that this is the next number in the row\nSince the first two numbers in this row are 1 and 10, the next number is 45.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{45}$"
