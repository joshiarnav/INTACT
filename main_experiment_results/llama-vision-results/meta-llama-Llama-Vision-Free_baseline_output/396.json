    "problem": "We roll a fair 6-sided die 5 times.  What is the probability that we get a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls?",
    "solution": "The number of ways to roll exactly 2 6's is $\\binom{5}{2}5^3$, since there are $\\binom{5}{2}$ choices for which of the two dice are 6, and there are 5 choices for each of the other 3 dice. Similarly, the number of ways to roll exactly 1 6 is $\\binom{5}{1}5^4$, and the number of ways to roll no 6's is $\\binom{5}{0}5^5$. So the probability is \\[\\frac{\\binom{5}{2}5^3+\\binom{5}{1}5^4+\\binom{5}{0}5^5}{6^5}=\\boxed{\\frac{625}{648}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, we need to understand the problem and work through the logic of rolling a fair 6-sided die 5 times and finding the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls.\n## Step 2:  To calculate the probability, we should break down the problem into manageable parts and consider all possible scenarios.\n## Step 3:  The first step is to find the probability of getting exactly 0 sixes in the 5 rolls. This probability is given by $\\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right) ^5$, since we have 5 independent trials with a $\\frac{5}{6}$ probability of not getting a 6 in each trial.\n## Step 4:  Next, we need to find the probability of getting exactly 1 six in the 5 rolls. This can be calculated using the binomial coefficient, which gives us the number of ways to choose 1 success out of 5 trials. The probability of getting exactly 1 six is $\\binom{5}{1} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right) \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right) ^4$.\n## Step 5:  Similarly, we need to calculate the probability of getting exactly 2 sixes in the 5 rolls. This probability is given by $\\binom{5}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right) ^2 \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right) ^3$.\n## Step 6:  Once we have these probabilities, we can sum them to find the total probability of getting at most 2 sixes in the 5 rolls.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls is given by $\\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right) ^5 + \\binom{5}{1} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right) \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right) ^4 + \\binom{5}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right) ^2 \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right) ^3$.\n## Step 8:  This expression represents the sum of the probabilities of getting exactly 0, 1, or 2 sixes in the 5 rolls, which gives us the total probability of getting at most 2 sixes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{301}{324}}$"
