    "problem": "In the game of Twister, a spinner randomly selects either an arm or a leg, and also selects one of four colors, one of which is red, each with equal probability, and players have to move the appropriate body part to the appropriately colored spot on the ground. There are four players. Each player spins once, and makes the move the spinner selects. What is the probability that in these four spins, there will be exactly two moves to a red spot, and the body part selected to move will be an arm exactly $3$ times?",
    "solution": "There are  $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to pick which $2$ of the $4$ spins will come up red. Each spin has a $1/4$ chance of coming up red, and $3/4$ chance of not coming up red, so once we pick which $2$ spins we want to come up red, there is a $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{\\!2}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{\\!2}$ chance that the two spins we pick come up red and the other two do not. So, there is a $$6\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{\\!2}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{\\!2}=\\frac{27}{128}$$chance that exactly $2$ come up red.\n\nThere are  $\\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways to pick which 3 of the 4 spins will point to an arm. Each spin has a $1/2$ chance of pointing to an arm, and $1/2$ chance of not pointing to an arm, so once we pick which $3$ spins we want to point to an arm, there is a $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!3}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!1}$ chance that the three spins we pick come up arm and the other one does not. So, there is a $$4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!3}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!1} = \\frac{1}{4}$$chance that exactly $3$ spins point to an arm.\n\nThe color selection and limb selection are independent events, so the probability that they both happen is the product of their individual probabilities; $\\frac{27}{128} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{512}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the probability of spinning a red spot\nThe probability of spinning a red spot is 1 out of 4, since there are 4 colors and only 1 of them is red. So, the probability of spinning a red spot is 1/4.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of spinning an arm\nThe probability of spinning an arm is 1 out of 2, since there are 2 body parts (arm or leg) and the spinner selects one of them with equal probability. So, the probability of spinning an arm is 1/2.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of spinning exactly two red spots and three arms in four spins\nWe can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of exactly two successes (spinning a red spot) out of four trials, with a probability of success of 1/4. The probability of exactly two successes is given by:\n\\[P(X = 2) = \\binom{4}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2\\]\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of spinning exactly three arms\nThe probability of spinning exactly three arms out of four spins, with a probability of success of 1/2, is given by the binomial distribution:\n\\[P(X = 3) = \\binom{4}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^1\\]\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of spinning exactly two red spots and three arms in four spins\nThe probability of spinning exactly two red spots and three arms is the product of the probabilities of spinning exactly two red spots and exactly three arms:\n\\[P(\\text{2 red spots and 3 arms}) = P(X = 2) \\times P(X = 3)\\]\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression\nSince\n\\[P(X = 2) = \\binom{4}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = 6 \\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right) \\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\frac{54}{256}\\]\nand\n\\[P(X = 3) = \\binom{4}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^1 = 4 \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\\]\nwe have that\n\\[P(\\text{2 red spots and 3 arms}) = P(X = 2) \\times P(X = 3) = \\frac{54}{256} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{54}{1024}\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{27}{512}}$"
