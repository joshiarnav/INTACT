    "problem": "A drawer contains 3 white balls and 6 black balls.  Two balls are drawn out of the box at random.  What is the probability that they both are white?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ combinations of two balls that can be drawn.  There are $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ combinations of two white balls that can be drawn.  So the probability that two balls pulled out are both white is $\\dfrac{3}{36} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{12}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the total number of balls in the drawer\nThere are 3 white balls and 6 black balls in the drawer, making a total of 9 balls.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of the 9\nThe total number of ways to draw 2 balls out of 9 is given by the combination formula, which is $\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$. In this case, $n = 9$ and $r = 2$, so the total number of ways is $\\frac{9!}{2!(9-2)!} = \\frac{9!}{2!7!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2} = 36$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to draw 2 white balls\nThe number of ways to draw 2 white balls out of the 3 available is also given by the combination formula, which is $\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$. Here, $n = 3$ and $r = 2$, so the number of ways to draw 2 white balls is $\\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \\frac{3!}{2!1!} = 3$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that both balls drawn are white\nThe probability that both balls are white is the number of ways to draw 2 white balls divided by the total number of ways to draw 2 balls. So the probability is $\\frac{3}{36}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the fraction representing the probability\nThe fraction $\\frac{3}{36}$ can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. This gives a simplified probability of $\\frac{1}{12}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$"
