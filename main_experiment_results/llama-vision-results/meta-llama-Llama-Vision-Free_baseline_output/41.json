    "problem": "An ant is walking on a hexagon. At each step, he moves from the vertex on which he is standing to an adjacent vertex. After $15$ steps, what is the probability that he is standing on the same vertex on which he began?",
    "solution": "There are two ways in which the ant can return to his original vertex: either he can go part of the way around the hexagon and then retrace his steps, or he can go all the way around the hexagon. In the first case, the ant necessarily moves an even number of steps, because his total number of steps is twice the number of steps needed to get to the point at which he begins to retrace. In the second case, because a hexagon has an even number of vertices, the ant is again moving an even number of steps. Thus, he has no way to return to the vertex on which he began in an odd number of steps, so the probability is $\\boxed{0}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem and identify key constraints\nWe have an ant moving on a hexagon, and it can move to any adjacent vertex from the one it's currently standing on. We are interested in finding the probability that after $15$ steps, the ant ends up on the same vertex where it started.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the possible number of steps for the ant to return to its starting vertex\nIn order for the ant to return to its starting vertex, it must make $6$ steps to each of the $6$ other vertices and then return to the first vertex, which means it needs to make $6$ steps to the first vertex to return to the starting point. Any number of steps less than $6$ would not allow the ant to return to the starting point.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of steps required for the ant to return to its starting vertex\nSince the ant needs to make $6$ steps to the starting vertex to return to it, and we need to consider all the possible paths, we can use the combination formula. This is a classic problem of finding the number of combinations of $n$ steps to choose $6$ steps, which can be represented as $\\binom{15}{6}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of total paths available to the ant in 15 steps\nSince the ant can move in $6$ different directions from each step, the total number of paths available to the ant in $15$ steps is $6^{15}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of the ant returning to the starting vertex\nUsing the number of total paths available and the number of paths that lead to the starting vertex, we can calculate the probability of the ant returning to the starting vertex. This is given by the ratio of the number of paths that lead back to the starting vertex to the total number of paths available.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $\\binom{15}{6}$\n$\\binom{15}{6} = \\frac{15!}{6!(15-6)!} = \\frac{15!}{6!9!} = \\frac{15*14*13*12*11*10}{6*5*4*3*2*1} = 5005$\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability of the ant returning to the starting vertex\n$P(\\text{ant returns to starting vertex}) = \\frac{\\binom{15}{6}}{6^{15}} = \\frac{5005}{6^{15}}$\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the value of $6^{15}$\n$6^{15} = 6^{2 \\cdot 7 + 1} = (6^2)^7 \\cdot 6 = 36^7 \\cdot 6 = 36^7 \\cdot 6 = 2^{21} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 6$\n\n## Step 9: Calculate $2^{21} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 6$\n$2^{21} = 2097152$, $3^{10} = 59049$, $6 = 6$. Therefore, $2^{21} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 6 = 2097152 \\cdot 59049 \\cdot 6 = 2097152 \\cdot 354294 = 743144121088$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the probability of the ant returning to the starting vertex\n$P(\\text{ant returns to starting vertex}) = \\frac{5005}{743144121088}$\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the fraction to obtain the probability\n$P(\\text{ant returns to starting vertex}) = \\frac{5005}{743144121088} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19}{2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 13}$\n\n## Step 12: Determine the specific simplification to obtain the probability\nThe fraction can be simplified by cancelling the common factors in the numerator and the denominator, $P(\\text{ant returns to starting vertex}) = \\frac{5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19}{2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 13}$\n\n## Step 13: Identify simplification\nWe can simplify the expression by cancelling the $7$ and the $13$ from both the numerator and the denominator, so that we get $P(\\text{ant returns to starting vertex}) = \\frac{5 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19}{2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 7}$\n\n## Step 14: Further simplification\nWe can further simplify the expression by calculating the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is $5 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19 = 19835$. The denominator is $2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 7 = 2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 7 = 2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 7$. Therefore, $P(\\text{ant returns to starting vertex}) = \\frac{19835}{2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 7}$.\n\n## Step 15: Calculate the final probability\n$P(\\text{ant returns to starting vertex}) = \\frac{19835}{2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 7} = \\frac{19835}{2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 7} = \\frac{19835}{2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 7} = \\frac{19835}{2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 7} = 0.0000543113684$\n\n## Step 16: Convert the probability to the required format\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4398046511104}}$"
