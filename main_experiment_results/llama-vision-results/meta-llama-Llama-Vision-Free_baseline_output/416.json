    "problem": "Mary has $6$ identical basil plants, and three different window sills she can put them on. How many ways are there for Mary to put the plants on the window sills?",
    "solution": "Since the plants are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of plants on each window sill.\n\nIf all the plants are on one window  sill, there are $3$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.\n\nIf $5$ plants are on one window sill and the last is on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants go on which window sill.\n\nIf $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.\n\nIf $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are each on one of the other windows, there are $3$ ways to choose which window the $4$ plants are on.\n\nIf $3$ plants are on one window and the other $3$ plants are all on another window, there are $3$ ways to choose which window has no plants.\n\nIf $3$ plants are on one window, $2$ plants on another window, and $1$ plant on the last window, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants are on which windows.\n\nIf $2$ plants are on each window, there is only one way to arrange them.\n\nIn total, there are $3+6+6+3+3+6+1=\\boxed{28}$ ways to arrange the plants on the window sills.\n\nSee if you can find a faster way to do this problem by considering lining up the plants, and placing two dividers among the plants to separate them into three groups corresponding to the sills.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Mary has 6 identical basil plants and 3 different window sills she can place them on. We need to find the number of ways she can arrange these plants on the window sills.\n## Step 2:  This problem can be solved using the concept of combinations with repetitions, also known as \"stars and bars\" or multichoosing.\n## Step 3:  The formula for combinations with repetitions is given by $\\binom{n+r-1}{r}$, where $n$ is the number of distinct objects (in this case, the window sills) and $r$ is the number of items to distribute (the basil plants).\n## Step 4:  In Mary's case, she has 6 plants and 3 window sills, so the number of ways to arrange the plants is $\\binom{3+6-1}{6}$.\n## Step 5:  Plugging in the values, we get $\\binom{8}{6}$.\n## Step 6:  Simplifying this, we have $\\binom{8}{6} = \\frac{8!}{6!(8-6)!}$.\n## Step 7:  Further simplifying, we get $\\binom{8}{6} = \\frac{8!}{6!2!} = \\frac{8\\cdot7}{2\\cdot1}$.\n## Step 8:  Calculating the expression, we find $\\binom{8}{6} = 28$.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, there are 28 ways for Mary to put the 6 identical basil plants on the 3 different window sills.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28}$"
