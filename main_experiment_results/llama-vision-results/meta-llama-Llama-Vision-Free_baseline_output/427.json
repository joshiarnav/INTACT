    "problem": "Phillip flips an unfair coin eight times. This coin is twice as likely to come up heads as tails. How many times as likely is Phillip to get exactly three heads than exactly two heads?",
    "solution": "The probability that Phillip flips $k$ heads is $$\\binom8k\\left(\\frac23\\right)^k\\left(\\frac13\\right)^{8-k}=\\frac1{3^8}\\binom8k2^k,$$  since there are $\\binom{8}{k}$ ways that $k$ out of $8$ coins will come up heads, and each of these arrangements of $k$ heads out of $8$ coins occurs with probability $\\left(\\frac23\\right)^k\\left(\\frac13\\right)^{8-k}$.   Therefore, the ratio of the two probabilities in the problem is equal to $$\\frac{\\binom832^3}{\\binom822^2}=\\frac{8\\cdot7\\cdot6}{3\\cdot2\\cdot1}\\cdot\\frac{2\\cdot1}{8\\cdot7}\\cdot\\frac{2^3}{2^2}=\\frac{6}{3}\\cdot2=\\boxed{4}.$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nPhillip flips an unfair coin eight times. The coin is twice as likely to come up heads as tails. We need to find out how many times as likely Phillip is to get exactly three heads than exactly two heads.\n\n## Step 2: Define the probabilities of getting heads and tails\nLet's denote the probability of getting tails as p. Since the coin is twice as likely to come up heads as tails, the probability of getting heads is 2p.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of getting exactly three heads\nTo get exactly three heads in eight flips, we need to use the binomial probability formula: P(X=k)=(nCk)(p^k)(q^(n-k)), where P(X=k) is the probability of getting k successes, n is the number of trials, nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success, and q is the probability of failure. Here, n=8, k=3, p=2p/3 (probability of heads), and q=1/3 (probability of tails).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of combinations for exactly three heads\nThe number of combinations of 8 items taken 3 at a time (8C3) can be calculated as 8! / (3!(8-3)!), which equals 56.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of getting exactly three heads\nUsing the binomial probability formula, the probability of getting exactly three heads is (56)((2p/3)^3)((1/3)^(8-3)) = (56)(8p^3/27)(1/3^5).\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of getting exactly two heads\nThe number of combinations of 8 items taken 2 at a time (8C2) can be calculated as 8! / (2!(8-2)!), which equals 28.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability of getting exactly two heads\nUsing the binomial probability formula, the probability of getting exactly two heads is (28)((2p/3)^2)((1/3)^(8-2)) = (28)(4p^2/9)(1/3^6).\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the ratio of the probabilities\nNow we can calculate the ratio of the probability of getting exactly three heads to the probability of getting exactly two heads. This is equal to ((56)(8p^3/27)(1/3^5)) / ((28)(4p^2/9)(1/3^6)).\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the ratio\nThe ratio can be simplified as (56*8*9)/(27*28*4)*(p^3)/(p^2)*(1/3^5)*(3^6) which equals (8/3)p*3^1.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the ratio\nSince the probability of getting heads is 2p, we can substitute 2p into the expression for the ratio: (8/3)*2p*3 = 16p/1 = 16.\n\n## Step 11: Find the final answer\nThe final answer should represent how many times more likely Phillip is to get exactly three heads than exactly two heads."
