    "problem": "Suppose that we win $\\$2$ if we flip a heads on a coin toss, but lose $\\$1$ if we flip tails.  What is the expected value, in dollars, of our winnings after one flip?",
    "solution": "In one flip, we have a $1/2$ chance of getting heads and winning 2 dollars, and a $1/2$ chance of getting tails and losing 1 dollar.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\$2) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\$1) = \\boxed{\\$0.50}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the possible outcomes of the coin flip\nThe two possible outcomes of a coin flip are heads and tails.\n\n## Step 2: Assign a value to each outcome\nWe win $\\$2$ if we flip heads, but lose $\\$1$ if we flip tails.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of each outcome\nThe probability of flipping heads is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of flipping tails is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the expected value of our winnings\nThe expected value is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these values. Therefore, the expected value is $(2)(\\frac{1}{2}) + (-1)(\\frac{1}{2})$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression\n$(2)(\\frac{1}{2}) + (-1)(\\frac{1}{2}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$"
