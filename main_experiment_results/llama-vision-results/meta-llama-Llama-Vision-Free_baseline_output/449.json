    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the range of integers between 200 and 300 that are perfect squares.\nTo find the integers between 200 and 300 that are perfect squares, we need to consider the square roots of the numbers. Since the square of an integer between 14 and 17 will fall within the range of 200 and 300.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the perfect squares within the specified range.\nThe perfect squares between 200 and 300 are 16^2 = 256 and 17^2 = 289.\n\n## Step 3: Count the number of perfect squares identified.\nWe have 2 integers that are perfect squares within the specified range.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
