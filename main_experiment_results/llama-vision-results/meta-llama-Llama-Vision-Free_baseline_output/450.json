    "problem": "What is the coefficient of $xy$ in the expansion of $(3x+(2y+1))^2$?",
    "solution": "Using the Binomial Theorem, we can expand this to get $(3x)^2+2(3x)(2y+1)+(2y+1)^2$. The only $xy$ comes from the middle term $2(3x)(2y+1)=12xy+6x$, hence the coefficient is $\\boxed{12}$.",

To find the coefficient of $xy$, we need to expand this expression.\n## Step 3:  The expansion involves squaring the given expression, which means we will have to use the formula $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.\n## Step 4:  Here, $a = 3x$ and $b = 2y+1$. We will substitute these values into the formula.\n## Step 5:  Substituting $a$ and $b$ into the formula, we get:\n## Step 6:  $(3x+(2y+1))^2 = (3x)^2 + 2(3x)(2y+1) + (2y+1)^2$\n## Step 7:  Expanding each term, we get:\n## Step 8:  $(3x)^2 = 9x^2$\n## Step 9:  $2(3x)(2y+1) = 12xy+6x$\n## Step 10:  $(2y+1)^2 = 4y^2 + 4y + 1$\n## Step 11:  Now, we need to find the coefficient of $xy$ in the expanded expression.\n## Step 12:  The term involving $xy$ is $12xy$. So, the coefficient of $xy$ in the expansion is the coefficient of $12xy$.\n## Step 13:  Therefore, the coefficient of $xy$ in the expansion of $(3x+(2y+1))^2$ is $\\boxed{12}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
