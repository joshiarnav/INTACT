    "problem": "Morgan has 3 hockey shirts, 2 football shirts and 7 baseball shirts in her closet. If she randomly selects one of these shirts, what is the probability that it will not be a baseball shirt? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are $3+2 + 7 =12$ shirts to choose from. A total of $2+3 = 5$ of these, all the hockey and football shirts, are not baseball shirts. So, the probability of not getting a baseball shirt is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{12}}$.",
