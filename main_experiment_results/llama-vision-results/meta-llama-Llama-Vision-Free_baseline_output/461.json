    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are distinguishable and the boxes are distinguishable?",
    "solution": "There are 3 different boxes, so each of the 5 balls can be placed in three different locations.  So the answer is $3^5 = \\boxed{243}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are dealing with a problem of distributing distinguishable balls into distinguishable boxes.\n## Step 2:  Since both the balls and the boxes are distinguishable, we can think of this as an independent choice for each ball regarding which box it goes into.\n## Step 3:  Each of the 5 balls has 3 choices of boxes into which it can be placed, and these choices are independent of each other.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, to find the total number of ways to distribute the 5 balls into the 3 boxes, we can simply multiply the number of choices available for each ball, which is 3 in this case.\n## Step 5:  This can be calculated as $3^5$, representing the choice of box for each of the 5 balls.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{243}$"
