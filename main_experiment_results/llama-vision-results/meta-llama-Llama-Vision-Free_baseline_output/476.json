    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the value of 9! (9 factorial) and 11! (11 factorial).\n## Step 2:  The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to that number. So, 9! = 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, and 11! = 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.\n## Step 3:  Now, let's calculate the values of 9! and 11!. 9! = 362,880 and 11! = 39,916,800.\n## Step 4:  The problem is asking us to find the integer factor by which 9! must be multiplied to equal 11!. In other words, we need to find the integer k such that 9! * k = 11!.\n## Step 5:  We can rewrite this equation as k = 11! / 9!. This will give us the integer factor that we need to multiply 9! by to get 11!.\n## Step 6:  Substituting the values we calculated earlier, we get k = 39,916,800 / 362,880.\n## Step 7:  Dividing 39,916,800 by 362,880 gives us 110.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the integer factor by which 9! must be multiplied to equal 11! is 110.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{110}$"
