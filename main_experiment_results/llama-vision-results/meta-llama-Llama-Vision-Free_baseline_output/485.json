    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 4 balls in 3 boxes if two balls are indistinguishably green, two are indistinguishably red, and the boxes are distinguishable?",
    "solution": "We will consider this as a composite of two problems with two indistinguishable balls and 3 distinguishable boxes.  For two indistinguishable green balls, we can place the balls in a box together or in separate boxes.  There are $3$ options to arrange them together (in box 1, 2, or 3) and $3$ options for placing them separately (nothing in box 1, 2, or 3).  So there are 6 ways to arrange the indistinguishable green balls.  By the same reasoning, there are 6 ways to arrange the indistinguishable red balls, for a total of $6 \\times 6 = \\boxed{36}$ arrangements of the 4 balls.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the constraints\nWe have 4 balls in total, with 2 being indistinguishably green and 2 indistinguishably red. The boxes are distinguishable, meaning each box is unique and can be identified.\n\n## Step 2: Calculating distributions\nSince the balls of the same color are indistinguishable, we can think of this problem as distributing 4 items into 3 distinct groups. The items can be thought of as the balls, and the groups as the boxes.\n\n## Step 3: Enumerating the possibilities\nTo enumerate the possibilities, we can start by placing the green balls first, and then place the red balls. We can then count the number of distinct configurations.\n- There are 4 ways to place the two green balls in the boxes: (2,0,2), (0,2,2), (2,2,0), and (0,0,4).\n- For each of these configurations, we can place the two red balls in the remaining spaces in 3 ways: either in a single box, or split between two boxes.\n\n## Step 4: Counting the possibilities for each configuration\n- (2,0,2) and (0,2,2) have 3 possibilities each, since the red balls can be in the same box as the green balls, or in a different box.\n- (2,2,0) has 1 possibility, since the red balls must be in the box with the remaining space.\n- (0,0,4) has 1 possibility, since all 4 balls must be in the same box.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the total number of possibilities\nTo calculate the total number of possibilities, we multiply the number of possibilities for each configuration together.\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n- 2 * 3 = 6\n- 1 * 1 = 1\n- 1 * 1 = 1\nWe add these together to get the total: 12 + 6 + 1 + 1 = 20.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$"
