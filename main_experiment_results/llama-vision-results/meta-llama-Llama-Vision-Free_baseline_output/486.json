    "problem": "How many integers are there on the number line between $\\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$?",
    "solution": "Because 17 is between $5\\times3=15$ and $6\\times 3 = 18$, we know that $\\dfrac{17}{3}$ is somewhere between $5$ and $6$. Since $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{17^2}{3^2}=\\dfrac{289}{9}$, we see that 289 is between $32\\times9=288$ and $33\\times9=297$ and thus that $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$ is between 32 and 33. Therefore, the integers from 6 to 32, inclusive, lie between $\\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$ on the number line, for a total of $32-6+1=\\boxed{27}$ integers.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the integers between two given numbers, we first need to determine the range of the numbers we are dealing with.\nWe are given the numbers $\\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$. First, let's calculate $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$ to understand the range we are dealing with.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$.\n$\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2 = \\dfrac{289}{9}$\n\n## Step 3: We now know that the numbers we are looking for integers between are $\\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\\dfrac{289}{9}$. Let's convert these numbers to a decimal to get a better understanding of the range.\n$\\dfrac{17}{3} = 5.67$ and $\\dfrac{289}{9} = 32.11$\n\n## Step 4: We now know that we are looking for integers between 5.67 and 32.11. Let's count the integers in this range.\nThe integers between 5.67 and 32.11 are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32.\n\n## Step 5: Count the total number of integers in the range.\nThere are 27 integers between 5.67 and 32.11.\n\n## Step 6: Since the number line is continuous, we need to check if the endpoints are included in the count.\nSince the endpoints are not integers, they are not included in the count.\n\n## Step 7: We have determined that the integers between $\\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$ are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32.\n\n## Step 8: We can now calculate the total number of integers between $\\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$.\nThere are 27 integers between $\\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$"
