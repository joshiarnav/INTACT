    "problem": "How many ways are there to put five beads on a necklace if there are eight distinct beads to choose from, and rotations and reflections of the necklace are considered the same?",
    "solution": "Not considering rotations and reflections, there are 8 ways to choose the first bead to put on the necklace, followed by 7, 6, 5, and 4 ways to choose the next beads. For each arrangements of beads on the necklace, there are 5 ways to rotate it and another 5 ways to reflect it and then rotate it to another arrangement. Thus, arrangements of beads on the necklace come in groups of 10 equivalent arrangements. The total number of different arrangements is therefore $8\\cdot7\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot4/10=\\boxed{672}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are given eight distinct beads from which we need to choose five beads to put on a necklace.\n## Step 2:  Since rotations and reflections of the necklace are considered the same, we need to find the number of unique circular arrangements of the beads.\n## Step 3:  To start solving this problem, we first consider the total number of ways to choose 5 beads out of 8, which is given by $\\binom{8}{5}$.\n## Step 4:  However, this count includes many arrangements that are essentially the same when considering rotations and reflections.\n## Step 5:  For instance, if we have a necklace with five distinct beads, there are eight possible rotations (including the original position), and each of these can be flipped to create a mirror image, resulting in a total of 16 identical arrangements.\n## Step 6:  But we're not just considering rotations, we're also considering reflections. This means that each arrangement has 8 rotations and 8 reflections, making a total of 16 identical arrangements.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the total number of unique arrangements is reduced by a factor of 16.\n## Step 8:  This means that the initial count of $\\binom{8}{5}$ overcounts the unique arrangements.\n## Step 9:  To find the number of unique arrangements, we divide the initial count by the number of identical arrangements, which is 16.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\dfrac{\\binom{8}{5}}{16} = \\dfrac{56}{16} = \\boxed{7/2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7/2}$"
