    "problem": "An integer is randomly chosen from the integers 1 through 100, inclusive. What is the probability that the chosen integer is a perfect square or a perfect cube, but not both? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "A number is a perfect square and a perfect cube if and only if it is a perfect sixth power.  Note that $10^2 = 100$ and $4^3<100<5^3$, while $2^6 < 100 < 3^6 = 9^3$.  Hence, there are 10 squares and 4 cubes between 1 and 100, inclusive.  However, there are also 2 sixth powers, so when we add $10 + 4$ to count the number of squares and cubes, we count these sixth powers twice.  However, we don't want to count these sixth powers at all, so we must subtract them twice.  This gives us a total of $10 + 4 - 2\\cdot 2 = 10$ different numbers that are perfect squares or perfect cubes, but not both.  Thus, our probability is $\\frac{10}{100} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the probability of choosing an integer that is a perfect square or a perfect cube but not both, we first need to identify the integers within the range of 1 through 100 that meet these conditions.\n## Step 2:  Perfect squares within this range are those numbers that can be expressed as the square of an integer. We can find these numbers by squaring the integers from 1 to 10, as $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the perfect squares in this range are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.\n## Step 3:  Next, we need to identify the perfect cubes within the range of 1 through 100. These are the numbers that can be expressed as the cube of an integer. We can find these numbers by cubing the integers from 1 to 4, as $4^3 = 64$. Therefore, the perfect cubes in this range are 1, 8, 27, 64, and 100.\n## Step 4:  However, we need to exclude numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes, which are 1 and 64. These numbers are counted twice, so we must subtract them from our list to avoid double counting.\n## Step 5:  After removing the numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes, we are left with the numbers 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 81, and 100 that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes but not both.\n## Step 6:  There are 8 numbers that satisfy the given conditions, so the probability is $\\frac{8}{100} = \\frac{2}{25}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{25}}$"
