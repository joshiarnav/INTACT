    "problem": "I have four identical oranges. How many ways are there for me to divide these oranges into at most three groups?  (By definition, a group must have at least one orange.)",
    "solution": "All the oranges can go in one group, or $3$ can go in one group and $1$ in another group, or $2$ can go in one group and $2$ in another group, or $2$ can go in one group and each of the other $2$ can be in a group by itself.\n\nAs a list, we have: \\begin{align*}\n&4 \\\\\n&3,1\\\\\n&2,2\\\\\n&2,1,1.\n\\end{align*} This gives a total of $\\boxed{4}$ possibilities.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: We can divide the oranges into at most three groups, so we need to consider the cases where the oranges are divided into 1, 2, or 3 groups.\n\n## Step 2: For the case where we divide into 1 group, there is 1 way to do this.\n\n## Step 3: For the case where we divide into 2 groups, the possible distributions are (4,0), (3,1), and (2,2). This gives us 3 ways to divide into 2 groups.\n\n## Step 4: For the case where we divide into 3 groups, the possible distributions are (4,0,0), (3,1,0), and (2,2,0), and (2,1,1). This gives us 4 ways to divide into 3 groups.\n\n## Step 5: To find the total number of ways to divide the oranges into at most three groups, we need to sum up the number of ways from each case.\n\n## Step 6: Summing up the number of ways from each case gives us 1 + 3 + 4 = 8.\n\n## Step 7: Therefore, the total number of ways to divide the oranges into at most three groups is 8.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
