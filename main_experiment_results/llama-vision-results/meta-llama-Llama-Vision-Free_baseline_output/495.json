    "problem": "The Senate has 100 members, 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats.  In how many ways can I choose a 5-person committee consisting of 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats?",
    "solution": "There are 55 ways to choose the first Republican, 54 ways to choose the second Republican, and 53 ways to choose the third Republican; however, we must divide by $3!$ because order does not matter.  So the number of ways to choose Republicans is $\\dfrac{55 \\times 54 \\times 53}{3!} = 26,\\!235$. There are 45 ways to choose the first Democrat and 44 ways to choose the second Democrat, but we must divide by $2!$ because order does not matter.  So the number of ways to choose the Democrats is $\\dfrac{45 \\times 44}{2!} = 990$.  So there are $26,\\!235 \\times 990 = \\boxed{25,\\!972,\\!650}$ ways to choose a committee.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans out of 55.\nThe number of ways to choose 3 Republicans out of 55 can be calculated using the combination formula, $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Here, n = 55 and k = 3.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 Democrats out of 45.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 Democrats out of 45 can also be calculated using the combination formula, where n = 45 and k = 2.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the combination of choosing 3 Republicans out of 55.\n$\\binom{55}{3} = \\frac{55!}{3!(55-3)!} = \\frac{55 \\times 54 \\times 53}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 15,605$\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the combination of choosing 2 Democrats out of 45.\n$\\binom{45}{2} = \\frac{45!}{2!(45-2)!} = \\frac{45 \\times 44}{2 \\times 1} = 990$\n\n## Step 5: Multiply the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans by the number of ways to choose 2 Democrats to get the total number of ways to choose a 5-person committee consisting of 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats.\nTotal number of ways = $\\binom{55}{3} \\times \\binom{45}{2} = 15,605 \\times 990$\n\n## Step 6: Perform the multiplication to get the final answer.\n$15,605 \\times 990 = 15,454,895$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15454895}$"
