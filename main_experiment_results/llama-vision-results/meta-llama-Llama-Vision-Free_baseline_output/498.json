    "problem": "During the school year, the 10 members of the chess club play a total of 900 games of chess during their practice matches. Each member plays against every other member $N$ times. What is the value of $N$?",
    "solution": "Since there are 10 club members, there are $\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10\\cdot 9}{2} = 45$ pairings of members.  Thus, each pair must have played $\\frac{900}{45} = \\boxed{20}$ games.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the number of games played between any two members, we can start by calculating the total number of games played by each member.\n\n## Step 2: Each of the 10 members plays 900 games in total. Since each game involves two members, the total number of games played is counted twice. So, the total number of games played is 900 * 2 = 1800.\n\n## Step 3: Next, we need to consider that each game is played between two members, so we are double counting each game. Therefore, the total number of games played is 1800 / 2 = 900.\n\n## Step 4: The total number of games played by the 10 members is given by the formula (n*(n-1))/2, where n is the total number of members. So, the total number of games is (10*(10-1))/2.\n\n## Step 5: When we calculate this expression, we get (10*9)/2 = 90/2 = 45. This is the total number of unique pairs of members.\n\n## Step 6: Now, each member plays against every other member N times. Therefore, the total number of games played is equal to the total number of unique pairs of members multiplied by N.\n\n## Step 7: We have already calculated the total number of unique pairs of members, which is 45. So, we have 45 * N = 900.\n\n## Step 8: To find the value of N, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 45. Therefore, N = 900 / 45.\n\n## Step 9: When we divide 900 by 45, we get 20. So, the value of N is 20.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$"
