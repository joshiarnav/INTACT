    "problem": "An airline serves a dinner to all the passengers on an airplane. They get their choice of steak or fish. Three steak meals and three fish meals are set aside for the six-member crew. If the meals are distributed to the crew members randomly, what is the probability that both pilots get the fish?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose 2 of the 6 meals for the pilots. There are $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways to choose 2 of the 3 fish meals. So the probability is $3/15 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to distribute the meals to the crew members\nThere are 6 crew members and 6 meals, with 3 being steak and 3 being fish. The total number of ways to distribute the meals is the number of permutations of 6 items, since the order matters (each member gets a distinct meal). This is calculated as 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways both pilots can get the fish\nThere are 2 pilots and 3 fish meals. To ensure both pilots get fish, there are 3 choices for the first pilot and 2 choices for the second pilot. After choosing meals for the pilots, 2 steak meals and 1 fish meal are left for the remaining 4 crew members. The 2 steak meals can be distributed to any of the 4 remaining members in 4P2 ways, which is 4 * 3 = 12 ways. The remaining fish meal can be distributed to any of the remaining 2 members in 2 ways. Therefore, the total number of ways both pilots can get fish is 3 * 2 * 12 * 2 = 144.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability that both pilots get the fish\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. The number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways both pilots can get fish, which we calculated as 144. The total number of outcomes is the total number of ways to distribute the meals, which we calculated as 720.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the probability\nThe probability is 144/720. This can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 144. This gives us 1/5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$"
