    "problem": "Mr. Patrick is preparing a five-question true-false quiz for his class. He flips a coin before writing the first question. If it is heads, he writes a true statement and if it is tails, he writes a false statement. He continues this until all five statements are written. What is the probability that the correct sequence of answers is TFTFT ? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Since all sequences of 5 answers are equally likely, the probability of any given 5-answer sequence is simply $\\frac{1}{2^5}$, since each answer is equally likely to be true or false. So, the answer evaluates to $\\frac{1}{2^5} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{32}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks for the probability that the correct sequence of answers to a five-question true-false quiz is TFTFT, given that Mr. Patrick flips a coin before writing each question and writes a true statement if it's heads and a false statement if it's tails.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of each question being written in the correct sequence\nSince each question is independent, the probability of writing a true statement is 1/2 and the probability of writing a false statement is also 1/2.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of the sequence TFTFT\nTo get the sequence TFTFT, the probability is (1/2)^5 because there are 5 questions and each question has a 1/2 chance of being the correct sequence (T for true and F for false).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final probability\nThe final probability is (1/2)^5 = 1/32.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{32}}$"
