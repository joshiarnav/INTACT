    "problem": "Our basketball team has 10 players, including Steve and Danny.  We need to divide into two teams of 5 for an intra-squad scrimmage.  In how many ways can we do this if Steve and Danny insist on playing on opposing teams?",
    "solution": "If Steve and Danny are on opposite teams, there are 8 other players to choose from for the other 4 spots on Steve's team, so there are $\\binom{8}{4} = \\boxed{70}$ choices.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of players available for selection after Steve and Danny are placed on opposing teams.\nSince Steve and Danny are on opposing teams, we have 8 players left to choose from to fill the remaining 4 spots on each team.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 4 players from the remaining 8 players to fill the first team.\nThis can be calculated using the combination formula $\\binom{n}{k}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of players to choose from and $k$ is the number of players to be chosen. Therefore, the number of ways to choose 4 players from 8 players is $\\binom{8}{4}=\\frac{8!}{4!(8-4)!}=\\frac{8!}{4!4!}=70$.\n\n## Step 3: After selecting the first team, there is only one way to form the second team.\nSince the remaining 4 players will automatically form the second team when the first team is chosen, there is only one way to form the second team after the first team has been selected.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways to divide the players into two teams.\nTo find the total number of ways to divide the players into two teams, we multiply the number of ways to choose the first team by the number of ways to choose the second team. However, since the second team is automatically formed once the first team is chosen, the total number of ways is simply equal to the number of ways to choose the first team, which is 70.\n\n## Step 5: Accounting for the fact that the teams are indistinguishable.\nSince the two teams are indistinguishable, we have counted each possible team twice (once when Steve's team is considered the \"first\" team and once when Danny's team is considered the \"first\" team). Therefore, the actual total number of distinct ways to divide the players into two teams is half of the calculated total, which is 70 / 2 = 35.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{35}$"
