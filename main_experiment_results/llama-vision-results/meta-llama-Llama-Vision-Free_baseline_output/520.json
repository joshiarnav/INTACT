    "problem": "Carlos has chosen twelve different compact discs (CDs) he would like to buy. Four are rap music, five are country music, and three are heavy metal music. Carlos then randomly selects five of the 12 CDs to purchase. What is the probability that his purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{12}{5}=792$ equally likely choices for the set of 5 CDs Carlos purchases.  Of these, $\\binom{9}{5}$ include no heavy metal CDs, $\\binom{8}{5}$ include no rap CDs, and $\\binom{7}{5}$ include no country CDs.  We can add these numbers to find the number of sets of CDs which do not include at least one CD from each category, except that we have counted the set of 5 country CDs twice, since it omits both heavy metal and rap.  Therefore,  \\[\n\\binom{9}{5}+\\binom{8}{5}+\\binom{7}{5}-1=126+56+21-1=202\n\\] of the sets of 5 CDs do not include at least one CD from each category.  Subtracting from 792, we find that 590 of the sets do include at least one CD from each category.  The probability that a chosen randomly set will be one of these is $\\dfrac{590}{792}=\\boxed{\\frac{295}{396}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1\nFirst let's determine the number of ways Carlos can choose 5 CDs from the 12 CDs he has chosen. This is a combination problem, and can be represented by the formula $C(n, k) = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items chosen. In this case, $n=12$ and $k=5$, so the number of ways to choose 5 CDs from the 12 CDs can be represented as $C(12,5) = \\frac{12!}{5!(12-5)!}$.\n\n## Step 2\nWe want to determine the number of favorable outcomes, i.e., the number of ways Carlos can choose 5 CDs that include at least one CD from each of the three categories. We can choose one CD from each of the three categories in $C(4,1)C(5,1)C(3,1)$, and choose two CDs from one category in $\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{5}{0}\\dbinom{3}{0}$, and choose three CDs from one category in $\\dbinom{4}{0}\\dbinom{5}{3}\\dbinom{3}{0}$.\n\n## Step 3\nWe want to determine the probability of Carlos choosing 5 CDs that include at least one CD from each of the three categories. The probability can be found by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.\n\n## Step 4\nWe can calculate the number of favorable outcomes by adding the number of ways to choose one CD from each category, the number of ways to choose two CDs from one category, and the number of ways to choose three CDs from one category.\n\n## Step 5\nWe can calculate the total number of outcomes by using the formula $C(12,5) = \\frac{12!}{5!(12-5)!}$.\n\n## Step 6\nWe can calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.\n\n## Step 7\nThe number of ways to choose one CD from each category is $C(4,1)C(5,1)C(3,1)$.\n\n## Step 8\nThe number of ways to choose two CDs from one category is $\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{5}{0}\\dbinom{3}{0}$.\n\n## Step 9\nThe number of ways to choose three CDs from one category is $\\dbinom{4}{0}\\dbinom{5}{3}\\dbinom{3}{0}$.\n\n## Step 10\nWe can calculate the total number of favorable outcomes by adding the number of ways to choose one CD from each category, the number of ways to choose two CDs from one category, and the number of ways to choose three CDs from one category.\n\n## Step 11\nThe total number of ways to choose 5 CDs from the 12 CDs can be calculated using the combination formula $C(12,5)$.\n\n## Step 12\nWe can calculate the probability by dividing the total number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.\n\n## Step 13\nThe probability that Carlos's purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories can be calculated as $\\frac{\\dbinom{4}{1}\\dbinom{5}{1}\\dbinom{3}{1}+\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{5}{0}\\dbinom{3}{0}+\\dbinom{4}{0}\\dbinom{5}{3}\\dbinom{3}{0}}{\\dbinom{12}{5}}$.\n\n## Step 14\nWe can simplify the expression by calculating the values of the combinations.\n\n## Step 15\n$\\dbinom{4}{1}\\dbinom{5}{1}\\dbinom{3}{1} = 4\\cdot5\\cdot3 = 60$.\n\n## Step 16\n$\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{5}{0}\\dbinom{3}{0} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!}\\cdot1\\cdot1 = 6$.\n\n## Step 17\n$\\dbinom{4}{0}\\dbinom{5}{3}\\dbinom{3}{0} = \\frac{4!}{0!(4-0)!}\\cdot\\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!}\\cdot1 = 10$.\n\n## Step 18\n$\\dbinom{12}{5} = \\frac{12!}{5!(12-5)!} = 792$.\n\n## Step 19\nWe can substitute these values into the expression for the probability.\n\n## Step 20\n$\\frac{\\dbinom{4}{1}\\dbinom{5}{1}\\dbinom{3}{1}+\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{5}{0}\\dbinom{3}{0}+\\dbinom{4}{0}\\dbinom{5}{3}\\dbinom{3}{0}}{\\dbinom{12}{5}} = \\frac{60+6+10}{792}$.\n\n## Step 21\n$\\frac{60+6+10}{792} = \\frac{76}{792}$.\n\n## Step 22\n$\\frac{76}{792} = \\frac{19}{198}$.\n\n## Step 23\nSo the probability that Carlos's purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories is $\\frac{19}{198}$.\n\n## Step 24\nTherefore, we have found the probability that Carlos's purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories.\n\n## Step 25\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{19}{198}}$"
