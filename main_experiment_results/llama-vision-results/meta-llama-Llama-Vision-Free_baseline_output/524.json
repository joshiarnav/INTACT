    "problem": "Regions $A, B, C, J$ and $K$ represent ponds. Logs leave pond $A$ and float down flumes (represented by arrows) to eventually end up in pond $B$ or pond $C$. On leaving a pond, the logs are equally likely to use any available exit flume. Logs can only float in the direction the arrow is pointing. What is the probability that a log in pond $A$ will end up in pond $B$?

    "solution": "There are two paths from A to B: A to K to B, and A to J to B.  The probability that a log will go from A to K to B is the probability that it will choose the middle flume initially times the probability that it will choose the flume to the right given that it chose the middle flume initially: $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\frac{1}{6}$.  Similarly, the probability that the log will go from A to J to B is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{9}$.  In total, the probability that the log reaches B is $\\dfrac{1}{6}+\\dfrac{1}{9}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the probability that a log in pond A will end up in pond B, we need to consider the various paths that a log can take from pond A to pond B.\n## Step 2:  Given that the logs are equally likely to use any available exit flume, we can start by analyzing the possible exit points from pond A.\n## Step 3:  From pond A, there are three possible exit points to pond J, and two possible exit points to pond K.\n## Step 4:  We know that the logs can only float in the direction the arrow is pointing, which means that once a log enters a pond, it can only move in the direction of the available exit flumes.\n## Step 5:  Now, we can trace the paths that a log can take from pond A to pond B. The log can go from pond A to pond J and then to pond B, or from pond A to pond K and then to pond B.\n## Step 6:  We see that in both cases, the log will eventually reach pond B from pond A.\n## Step 7:  However, we also notice that there are additional paths that the log can take from pond A to pond C, before finally ending up in pond B.\n## Step 8:  These additional paths include going from pond A to pond J, then to pond C, and finally to pond B; and going from pond A to pond K, then to pond C, and finally to pond B.\n## Step 9:  It's essential to consider all these paths to accurately calculate the probability of a log ending up in pond B.\n## Step 10:  Now, we can calculate the probability of a log ending up in pond B by considering the total number of paths that lead to pond B and the total number of paths that are available from pond A.\n## Step 11:  The probability of a log ending up in pond B is the number of paths leading to pond B divided by the total number of paths available from pond A.\n## Step 12:  Based on the given diagram, we can see that there are two paths that lead to pond B from pond A, and a total of 5 paths available from pond A.\n## Step 13:  Therefore, the probability that a log in pond A will end up in pond B is $\\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$"
