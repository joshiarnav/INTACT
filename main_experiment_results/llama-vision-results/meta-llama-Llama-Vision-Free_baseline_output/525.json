    "problem": "In how many ways can $7$ people sit around a round table if no two of the $3$ people Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other? (Seating arrangements which are rotations of each other are treated as the same.)",
    "solution": "After Pierre sits, we can place Rosa either two seats from Pierre (that is, with one seat between them) or three seats from Pierre. We tackle these two cases separately:\n\nCase 1: Rosa is two seats from Pierre. There are $2$ such seats. For either of these, there are then four empty seats in a row, and one empty seat between Rosa and Pierre. Thomas can sit in either of the middle two of the four empty seats in a row. So, there are $2\\cdot 2 = 4$ ways to seat Rosa and Thomas in this case. There are then $4$ seats left, which the others can take in $4! = 24$ ways. So, there are $4\\cdot 24 = 96$ seatings in this case.\n\nCase 2: Rosa is three seats from Pierre (that is, there are $2$ seats between them). There are $2$ such seats. Thomas can't sit in either of the $2$ seats directly between them, but after Rosa sits, there are $3$ empty seats in a row still, and Thomas can only sit in the middle seat of these three. Once again, there are $4$ empty seats remaining, and the $4$ remaining people can sit in them in $4! = 24$ ways. So, we have $2\\cdot 24 = 48$ seatings in this case.\n\nPutting our two cases together gives a total of $96+48 = \\boxed{144}$ seatings.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways 7 people can sit around a round table without any restrictions.\nThe total number of ways to arrange 7 people in a circle is (7-1)!, because we can fix one person's position and arrange the others around them.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of ways 7 people can sit around a round table with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting next to each other.\nWe can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit, so we have 5 units (the 3-person unit plus the 4 other people) to arrange in a circle, which gives us (5-1)! arrangements. However, within the 3-person unit, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in 3! ways. Therefore, the total number of arrangements with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting next to each other is (5-1)! * 3!.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways 7 people can sit around a round table with the restriction that no two of the 3 people Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other.\nThe total number of arrangements with the restriction is the total number of arrangements without restrictions minus the total number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the formula (n-1)! = (7-1)! = 6! to the total number of ways 7 people can sit around a round table without any restrictions.\n6! = 720.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the formula (n-1)! * m! to the total number of ways 7 people can sit around a round table with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting next to each other.\n(5-1)! * 3! = 4! * 3! = 24 * 6 = 144.\n\n## Step 6: Subtract the total number of ways 7 people can sit around a round table with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting next to each other from the total number of ways 7 people can sit around a round table without any restrictions.\n720 - 144 = 576.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{576}$"
