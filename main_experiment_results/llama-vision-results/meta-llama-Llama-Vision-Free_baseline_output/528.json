    "problem": "A cook has 10 red peppers and 5 green peppers. If the cook selects 6 peppers at random, what is the probability that he selects at least 4 green peppers? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We can count the number of ways to choose a group of 4 green and 2 red peppers and the number of ways to choose 5 green and 1 red peppers. These are $\\binom{5}{4}\\binom{10}{2}=5\\cdot45=225$ and $\\binom{5}{5}\\binom{10}{1}=10$. The total number of ways the cook can choose peppers is $\\binom{15}{6}=5005$. Therefore, the probability that out of six randomly chosen peppers at least four will be green is $\\frac{235}{5005}=\\boxed{\\frac{47}{1001}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the total number of ways to select 6 peppers from 15.\nThe cook has a total of 15 peppers (10 red and 5 green). To find the total number of ways to select 6 peppers, we use the combination formula, which is $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $k$ is the number of items to choose, and $!$ denotes factorial. Therefore, the total number of ways to select 6 peppers from 15 is $C(15, 6) = \\frac{15!}{6!(15-6)!}$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the factorial expression to find the total number of combinations.\nWe can simplify $C(15, 6) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}$, which is equal to $5005$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to select at least 4 green peppers.\nTo select at least 4 green peppers, the cook can choose either 4 green peppers and 2 red peppers, 5 green peppers and 1 red pepper, or 6 green peppers.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to select 4 green peppers and 2 red peppers.\nTo select 4 green peppers out of 5, we use the combination formula $C(5, 4) = \\frac{5!}{4!1!} = 5$. To select 2 red peppers out of 10, we use the combination formula $C(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = 45$. Therefore, the number of ways to select 4 green peppers and 2 red peppers is $5 \\times 45 = 225$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to select 5 green peppers and 1 red pepper.\nTo select 5 green peppers out of 5, we use the combination formula $C(5, 5) = \\frac{5!}{5!0!} = 1$. To select 1 red pepper out of 10, we use the combination formula $C(10, 1) = \\frac{10!}{1!(10-1)!} = 10$. Therefore, the number of ways to select 5 green peppers and 1 red pepper is $1 \\times 10 = 10$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to select 6 green peppers.\nTo select 6 green peppers out of 5, we use the combination formula $C(5, 6) = \\frac{5!}{6!(5-6)!} = 0$, as we cannot choose 6 green peppers from only 5.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total number of ways to select at least 4 green peppers.\nThe total number of ways to select at least 4 green peppers is $225 + 10 + 0 = 235$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the probability of selecting at least 4 green peppers.\nThe probability of selecting at least 4 green peppers is equal to the number of ways to select at least 4 green peppers divided by the total number of ways to select 6 peppers, which is $\\frac{235}{5005}$.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the fraction.\nSimplifying the fraction $\\frac{235}{5005}$ gives $\\frac{47}{1001}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{47}{1001}}$"
