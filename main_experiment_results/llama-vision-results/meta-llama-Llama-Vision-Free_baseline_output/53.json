    "problem": "Ali, Bonnie, Carlo and Dianna are going to drive together to a nearby theme park.  The car they are using has four seats: one driver's seat, one front passenger seat and two different back seats. Bonnie and Carlo are the only two who can drive the car. How many possible seating arrangements are there?",
    "solution": "There are 2 choices for the driver.  The other three can seat themselves in $3\\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$ different ways. So the number of seating arrangements is $2 \\times 6 =\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the constraints of the problem\nThe problem specifies that there are four individuals (Ali, Bonnie, Carlo, and Dianna) who need to be seated in a car with four seats: one driver's seat, one front passenger seat, and two back seats. The constraint is that Bonnie and Carlo are the only two who can drive the car.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of options for the driver's seat\nSince Bonnie and Carlo are the only two who can drive, there are two options for who can sit in the driver's seat.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of options for the front passenger seat\nOnce the driver is chosen, there are three remaining individuals who can sit in the front passenger seat. Therefore, there are three options for the front passenger seat.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of options for the two back seats\nOnce the driver and front passenger are chosen, there are two remaining individuals who can sit in the two back seats. The first back seat can be filled by any of the two remaining individuals, and the second back seat can be filled by the last individual. Therefore, there are 2 options for the first back seat and 1 option for the second back seat, giving a total of 2 * 1 = 2 options for the back seats.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of seating arrangements\nTo find the total number of seating arrangements, we multiply the number of options for each seat together: 2 (driver) * 3 (front passenger) * 2 (back seats) = 12.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the permutations of the remaining two people in the back seats\nSince the problem asks for the number of possible seating arrangements, and the order of people in the back seats matters (i.e., Ali and Dianna in the back seats is distinct from Dianna and Ali in the back seats), we must multiply the number of arrangements by the number of permutations of the remaining two people in the back seats. This number is 2, since there are 2 ways to arrange the remaining two people.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the final number of seating arrangements\nSince each of the 12 arrangements can be permuted in 2 ways, the total number of seating arrangements is 2 * 12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$"
