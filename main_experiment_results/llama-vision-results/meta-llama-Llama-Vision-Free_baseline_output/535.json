    "problem": "A school organization consists of 5 teachers, 7 parents and 6 students. A subcommittee of this group is formed by choosing 2 teachers, 3 parents and 3 students. How many different subcommittees can be formed?",
    "solution": "We can break this problem into three parts.  First, we will count the number of ways to choose teachers for the subcommittee.  We need to choose 2 teachers from the 5 in the school organization, which gives $\\dbinom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose the teachers.  Next, we choose parents.  We need to choose 3 parents out of 7, which gives $\\dbinom{7}{3}=35$ ways to choose the parents.  Finally, we choose the students.  There are 3 students chosen from 6, which gives $\\dbinom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose the students.  Each of these selections is independent, so the total number of possible subcommittees will be $10\\cdot 35\\cdot 20=\\boxed{7000}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 teachers from 5.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 teachers from 5 can be calculated using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial. So, for the teachers, we have C(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 10.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 parents from 7.\nUsing the same combination formula, we calculate the number of ways to choose 3 parents from 7. So, for the parents, we have C(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!) = 35.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 students from 6.\nAgain, applying the combination formula, we calculate the number of ways to choose 3 students from 6. So, for the students, we have C(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 20.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of different subcommittees that can be formed.\nTo find the total number of different subcommittees, we multiply the number of ways to choose the teachers, parents, and students together. So, the total number of subcommittees = 10 * 35 * 20.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the product of 10, 35, and 20.\n10 * 35 = 350, then 350 * 20 = 7000.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7000}$"
