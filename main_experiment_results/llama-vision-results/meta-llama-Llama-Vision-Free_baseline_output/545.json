    "problem": "How many subsets of the set of divisors of $72$ contain only composite numbers? For example, $\\{8,9\\}$ and $\\{4,8,12\\}$ are two such sets. Include the empty set in your count.",
    "solution": "We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \\cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to find all the divisors of 72.\n## Step 2:  The prime factorization of 72 is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2$. Therefore, any divisor of 72 will be of the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b$, where $a$ can range from 0 to 3 and $b$ can range from 0 to 2.\n## Step 3:  We can now list out all the divisors of 72 by considering all possible combinations of the powers of 2 and 3. This gives us the set of divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n## Step 4:  Now, we need to identify which of these divisors are composite numbers. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. In other words, it is any positive integer greater than one that is not a prime number.\n## Step 5:  We can see that all the numbers in the set of divisors are composite except for 1 and 2, and 3. So, our set of composite numbers is {4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72}.\n## Step 6:  Now we need to find the total number of subsets that can be formed using these composite numbers. The number of subsets of a set is given by $2^n$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. This is because for each element, we have two choices - either include it in the subset or not include it.\n## Step 7:  Since we have 9 composite numbers in our set, the total number of subsets that can be formed is $2^9 = 512$.\n## Step 8:  However, we also need to consider the empty set as a valid subset. Therefore, we need to add 1 to the total count of subsets.\n## Step 9:  Hence, the total number of subsets of the set of divisors of 72 that contain only composite numbers, including the empty set, is $512+1=\\boxed{513}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{513}$"
