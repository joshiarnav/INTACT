    "problem": "How many numbers between 100 and 200 (inclusive) are not perfect squares?",
    "solution": "There are $200-100+1 = 101$ numbers in the list $100, 101, \\ldots, 200$.  We can find 5 perfect squares in the list, namely $10^2,\\ldots,14^2$.  So the number of non-perfect-squares in the list is $101-5=\\boxed{96}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the numbers between 100 and 200 that are not perfect squares, we first need to identify the perfect squares within this range.\n## Step 2:  The largest perfect square less than 200 is $14^2=196$, and the smallest perfect square greater than 100 is $10^2=100$.\n## Step 3:  This means the perfect squares between 100 and 200 are $10^2, 11^2, 12^2, 13^2,$ and $14^2$.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, there are a total of 5 perfect squares in this range.\n## Step 5:  Since there are 101 numbers from 100 to 200 (inclusive), we can find the numbers that are not perfect squares by subtracting the number of perfect squares from the total count.\n## Step 6:  So, the number of numbers between 100 and 200 that are not perfect squares is $101 - 5 = 96$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{96}$"
