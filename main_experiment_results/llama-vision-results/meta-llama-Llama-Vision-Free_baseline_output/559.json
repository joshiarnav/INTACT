    "model_solution": "## Step 1: List all possible outcomes for both coins\nWe will calculate all the possible outcomes for both coins and then determine the number of outcomes with the same number of heads.\n\n## Step 2: List all possible outcomes for Coin A\nFor Coin A, which is flipped three times, we can get 0, 1, 2, or 3 heads. There are 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes for Coin A: HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT.\n\n## Step 3: List all possible outcomes for Coin B\nFor Coin B, which is flipped four times, we can get 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 heads. There are 2^4 = 16 possible outcomes for Coin B: HHHH, HHHT, HHTH, HHTT, HTHH, HTHT, HTTH, HTTT, THHH, THHT, THTH, THTT, TTHH, TTHT, TTTH, TTTT.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the number of outcomes with the same number of heads\nWe will compare each outcome of Coin A with each outcome of Coin B and count the number of outcomes with the same number of heads.\n\n## Step 5: Count the outcomes with 0 heads\nCoin A has 1 outcome with 0 heads (TTT) and Coin B has 1 outcome with 0 heads (TTTT). There is 1 outcome with 0 heads from both coins.\n\n## Step 6: Count the outcomes with 1 head\nCoin A has 3 outcomes with 1 head (HTT, THT, TTH) and Coin B has 4 outcomes with 1 head (HTTT, HTTH, THTT, TTHT). There are 3*4 = 12 outcomes with 1 head from both coins.\n\n## Step 7: Count the outcomes with 2 heads\nCoin A has 3 outcomes with 2 heads (HHT, HTH, THH) and Coin B has 6 outcomes with 2 heads (HHTT, HTHT, HTTH, THHT, THTH, TTHH). There are 3*6 = 18 outcomes with 2 heads from both coins.\n\n## Step 8: Count the outcomes with 3 heads\nCoin A has 1 outcome with 3 heads (HHH) and Coin B has 4 outcomes with 3 heads (HHHT, HHTH, HTHH, THHH). There are 1*4 = 4 outcomes with 3 heads from both coins.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the total number of outcomes with the same number of heads\nThe total number of outcomes with the same number of heads is 1 + 12 + 18 + 4 = 35.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the total number of outcomes\nThe total number of outcomes for both coins is 8 * 16 = 128.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the probability\nThe probability of getting the same number of heads from both coins is 35/128.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the fraction\nThe fraction 35/128 cannot be simplified.\n\n## Step 13: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{35}{128}}$"
