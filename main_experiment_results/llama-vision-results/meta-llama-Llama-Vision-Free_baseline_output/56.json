    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $11!$. Then since the I's, S's and the P's are not unique, we divide by $4!$, $4!$, and $2!$ for the arrangements of I's, S's, and P's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{11!}{4! \\times 4! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{34,\\!650}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem requires finding the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI, which means we need to calculate the total number of permutations of these letters.\n## Step 2:  There are 11 letters in the word MISSISSIPPI.\n## Step 3:  However, some of the letters repeat, with 4 S's, 4 I's, 2 P's, and 1 M. We need to account for the repetitions when calculating the total number of arrangements.\n## Step 4:  The total number of arrangements for a set of objects where some objects are indistinguishable is given by the formula $\\dfrac{n!}{n_1! \\cdot n_2! \\cdot ... \\cdot n_k!}$, where $n$ is the total number of objects, and $n_1, n_2, ..., n_k$ are the counts of each type of indistinguishable object.\n## Step 5:  Applying this formula to the word MISSISSIPPI, we get $\\dfrac{11!}{4! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 1!}$.\n## Step 6:  This simplifies to $\\dfrac{39916800}{24 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 2}$.\n## Step 7:  After simplifying, we get $\\dfrac{39916800}{1152}$.\n## Step 8:  Dividing $39916800$ by $1152$ gives us the total number of arrangements.\n## Step 9:  Calculating the value, we find that the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word MISSISSIPPI is $34650$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{34650}$"
