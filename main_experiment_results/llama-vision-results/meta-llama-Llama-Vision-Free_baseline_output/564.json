    "problem": "Five 6-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show a 1 or a 2?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which of the five dice show a 1 or 2. The probability of any one of these occurring is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{\\!3}$. So the overall probability is $$10\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{\\!3}=\\frac{10\\times 2^3}{3^5}=\\boxed{\\frac{80}{243}}.$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the total number of outcomes when rolling five 6-sided dice.\nEach die has 6 faces, so when rolling one die, there are 6 possible outcomes. Since we are rolling five dice, the total number of outcomes is $6^5$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of ways to choose exactly two dice out of five to show a 1 or a 2.\nThis is a combination problem, where we need to choose 2 dice out of 5 to show a 1 or a 2. The formula for combinations is $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. So, the number of ways to choose exactly two dice is $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = 10$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of the chosen dice showing a 1 or a 2 and the remaining dice not showing a 1 or a 2.\nEach chosen die has a $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$ chance of showing a 1 or a 2. Each non-chosen die has a $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$ chance of not showing a 1 or a 2. Since we have 2 chosen dice and 3 non-chosen dice, the probability of the chosen dice showing a 1 or a 2 and the remaining dice not showing a 1 or a 2 is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total probability by multiplying the number of ways to choose exactly two dice by the probability of the chosen dice showing a 1 or a 2 and the remaining dice not showing a 1 or a 2.\nThe total probability is the number of ways to choose exactly two dice (10) multiplied by the probability of the chosen dice showing a 1 or a 2 and the remaining dice not showing a 1 or a 2: $10 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression to get the final probability.\nSubstitute the values into the expression: $10 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = 10 \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right) \\left(\\frac{8}{27}\\right) = 10 \\left(\\frac{8}{243}\\right) = \\frac{80}{243}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{80}{243}}$"
