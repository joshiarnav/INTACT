    "problem": "A committee is to be made up from a group of 10 candidates. The committee must consist of a chairman and some (not necessarily nonzero) number of members-at-large. How many ways can the committee be chosen? (For example, suppose that Alex is chair while Betty, Carl, and D'Angelo make up the committee. This counts as the same as Alex being chair while Carl, Betty, and D'Angelo make up the committee. It is not the same as Betty being the chair, with Alex, Carl, and D'Angelo making up the committee. It is also not the same as Alex being chair with the committee consisting of Betty and Carl.)",
    "solution": "There are 10 ways to choose the chairman.  After choosing the chairman, we must form the rest of the committee.  For each of the other 9 candidates, we have 2 choices: either the candidate is on the committee or not.  So, the total number of ways we can form a committee with a given chairman is $2^9$.  Therefore, there are $10\\cdot 2^9 =\\boxed{5120}$ ways to form the committee.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks for the number of ways to choose a committee consisting of a chairman and some members-at-large from a group of 10 candidates, where the order of selection matters but the order of the members-at-large does not, and the number of members-at-large can be any non-negative integer.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the problem\nThe problem can be broken down into two parts: choosing the chairman and choosing the members-at-large.\n\n## Step 3: Choose the chairman\nThere are 10 candidates, and any one of them can be chosen as the chairman. Therefore, there are 10 ways to choose the chairman.\n\n## Step 4: Choose the members-at-large\nOnce the chairman is chosen, there are 9 candidates left. Any number of them can be chosen as members-at-large. Since the order of the members-at-large does not matter, this is equivalent to choosing a subset of the remaining 9 candidates. The number of ways to choose a k-element subset from a set of n elements is given by the binomial coefficient (n choose k), which is denoted as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\". Therefore, there are C(9, 0) + C(9, 1) + C(9, 2) + ... + C(9, 9) ways to choose the members-at-large.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to choose the members-at-large\nWe can use the formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!) to calculate the binomial coefficients. However, in this case, we can simplify the calculation by noting that the sum of binomial coefficients for a given n is equal to 2^n. Therefore, the number of ways to choose the members-at-large is 2^9 = 512.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of ways to choose the committee\nThe total number of ways to choose the committee is the product of the number of ways to choose the chairman and the number of ways to choose the members-at-large. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose the committee is 10 * 512 = 5120.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5120}$"
