    "problem": "Carson flips over the cards of a standard 52-card deck one at a time. What is the probability that he flips over the ace of spades before any face card (jack, queen or king)?",
    "solution": "There are 12 face cards, three from each suit. Within the deck, the 13 relevant cards (the face cards and the ace of spades) are arranged in some order. The probability that the first of these 13 cards is the ace is therefore $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{13}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of cards in a standard deck and the total number of face cards.\nA standard deck contains 52 cards. Among the 52 cards, there are 4 suits, each containing 13 cards (including an ace, numbered cards 2 through 10, and 3 face cards: jack, queen, and king). Therefore, there are 3 face cards per suit.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of face cards in the deck.\nSince there are 3 face cards (jack, queen, and king) per suit and there are 4 suits, the total number of face cards in the deck is 3 * 4 = 12.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of cards that are not face cards.\nSince there are 52 cards in total and 12 of them are face cards, the number of cards that are not face cards is 52 - 12 = 40.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the position of the ace of spades in the deck.\nThe ace of spades is one of the 52 cards, but since it is one of the 13 cards in the spades suit that are not face cards, it is among the 40 cards that are not face cards.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that Carson flips over the ace of spades before any face card.\nIf the ace of spades is among the first 12 cards (the face cards), it will be flipped over before any face card. The probability of this happening is 12/52, since there are 12 face cards in the deck. If the ace of spades is among the next 40 - 12 = 28 cards, the probability that it will be flipped over before any face card is the total number of favorable outcomes (28) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (52). However, since the favorable outcome in this scenario is the ace of spades being the first card to be flipped over after the face cards, we must consider the total number of cards that are not face cards. Therefore, the correct probability is the number of cards that are not face cards divided by the total number of cards in the deck.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability that the ace of spades is flipped before any face card.\nThe probability that the ace of spades is one of the first 12 cards is 12/52 = 3/13. The probability that it is among the remaining cards is 28/52, which simplifies to 7/13.\n\n## Step 7: Combine the probabilities to find the total probability that the ace of spades is flipped before any face card.\nHowever, as we have calculated in step 6, the probability calculation for the scenario where the ace is among the first 12 cards (3/13) is actually incorrect for this specific problem context. The correct approach should consider the total number of favorable outcomes (when the ace of spades is one of the first 40 cards) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (52). The correct probability calculation is simply the total number of cards that are not face cards (40) divided by the total number of cards in the deck (52), as the ace of spades is among these non-face cards.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the correct probability.\nThe correct probability is 40/52, which simplifies to 10/13.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{10}{13}}$"
