    "problem": "Alyssa has four marbles: a red one, a blue one, a green one, and a yellow one. In how many different ways can she form a set consisting of some of the marbles if she must choose at least one marble?  (In a set of chosen marbles, it does not matter in what order she chose the marbles.)",
    "solution": "Each of the four marbles can either be in Alyssa's set, or not.  That gives two possibilities for each marble, for a total of $2^4=16$ possible sets.  However, we are told the set must have at least one marble.  We need to subtract one to eliminate the case of an empty set, which we counted.  Our final answer is $16-1=\\boxed{15}$ sets.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Alyssa must choose at least one marble, so we can break this problem down by considering the different combinations of marbles she can choose.\nTo find the total number of ways Alyssa can form a set, we will calculate the number of combinations for each possible set size and then sum them up.\n\n## Step 2: We consider the different combinations for each possible set size:\n- If Alyssa chooses 1 marble, there are 4 possible combinations.\n- If Alyssa chooses 2 marbles, there are 6 possible combinations.\n- If Alyssa chooses 3 marbles, there are 4 possible combinations.\n- If Alyssa chooses all 4 marbles, there is 1 possible combination.\n\n## Step 3: We calculate the total number of combinations by adding the combinations for each set size.\nThe total number of combinations is 4 + 6 + 4 + 1.\n\n## Step 4: We evaluate the expression 4 + 6 + 4 + 1.\n4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 15.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
