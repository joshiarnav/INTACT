    "problem": "Mr. Smith brings home 7 animals for his 7 children.  Each child will adopt a pet to be her or his own.  There are 4 different cats (a Siamese, a Persian, a Calico, and a Minx), 2 different dogs (a Poodle and a Golden Retriever), and a goldfish.  Anna and Betty refuse to take care of the goldfish, and Charlie and Danny insist on having cats.  The other 3 kids are easier to please -- they'll take anything.  In how many ways can Mr. Smith give the children pets they'll want?",
    "solution": "Charlie can take one of the 4 cats, and Danny can take one of the 3 remaining cats, so there are $4\\times 3=12$ ways to give cats to these two kids. Since Anna and Betty can't take a goldfish, they select from the 4 remaining animals so there are $4\\times 3=12$ ways to give pets to these two kids. For the other three kids, there are $3\\times 2\\times 1=6$ ways to give out the remaining 3 pets. The answer is $12\\times 12\\times 6=\\boxed{864}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to distribute the 4 cats among Charlie and Danny.\nSince Charlie and Danny insist on having cats, there are 2 different cats Charlie can have, and 3 different cats Danny can have, so there are $2\\cdot 3 = 6$ different ways to distribute the 4 cats among Charlie and Danny.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to distribute the remaining animals to the remaining children.\nThere are 3 children remaining (Anna, Betty, and the third child). Since the remaining 3 kids are easier to please, they'll take anything. The remaining 3 animals (1 dog and 2 cats) can be distributed among the 3 remaining children in $3! = 6$ ways.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of ways to distribute the animals among the children.\nSince the distribution of the cats among Charlie and Danny is independent of the distribution of the remaining animals, we can multiply the number of ways to distribute the cats among Charlie and Danny by the number of ways to distribute the remaining animals. Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the animals among the children is $6 \\cdot 6 = 36$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final answer.\nSince there are 4 different cats (a Siamese, a Persian, a Calico, and a Minx), 2 different dogs (a Poodle and a Golden Retriever), and a goldfish, and the goldfish can be given to either Anna or Betty. Therefore, there are 2 ways to distribute the goldfish. So the final answer is $36\\cdot 2 = 72$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{72}$"
