    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We need to calculate the number of arrangements of the letters in the word GAMMAS.\n## Step 2:  Since there are 6 letters in the word, if all the letters were unique, there would be 6! arrangements.\n## Step 3:  However, the letters M and S are repeated twice each, so we need to divide the total number of arrangements by 2! twice to account for the repetition.\n## Step 4:  To calculate the total number of arrangements, we will use the formula: total arrangements = (total number of letters)! / ((number of repeated letters of one type)! * (number of repeated letters of another type)!).\n## Step 5:  Applying this formula, we get: total arrangements = 6! / (2! * 2!).\n## Step 6:  Calculating the factorial of 6, we get 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n## Step 7:  Calculating the factorial of 2, we get 2! = 2 * 1 = 2.\n## Step 8:  Substituting these values into the formula, we get: total arrangements = 720 / (2 * 2) = 720 / 4 = 180.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{180}$"
