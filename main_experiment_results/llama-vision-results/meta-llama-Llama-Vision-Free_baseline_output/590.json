    "problem": "If $a,$ $b$ and $c$ are three (not necessarily different) numbers chosen randomly and with replacement from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\},$ what is the probability that $ab+c$ is even?",
    "solution": "The quantity $ab+c$ is even if and only if $ab$ and $c$ are both odd or both even. The probability that $c$ is odd is $\\frac{3}{5},$ and the probability that $ab$ is odd is $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{25}$ (because both $a$ and $b$ must be odd). Therefore, the probability that $ab+c$ is even is \\[\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} + \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{9}{25}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{59}{125}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the condition for $ab+c$ to be even\nThe expression $ab+c$ will be even if either $ab$ is even or $c$ is even.\n\n## Step 2: Identify when $ab$ is even\n$ab$ is even when at least one of $a$ or $b$ is even. This means that the product $ab$ will be even if either $a$ or $b$ (or both) is chosen from the set $\\{2,4\\}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of possibilities for choosing $a$ and $b$\nSince $a$ and $b$ are chosen randomly and with replacement from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\},$ there are $5$ possible choices for each of $a$ and $b$, resulting in a total of $5 \\times 5 = 25$ possible pairs $(a,b)$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of possibilities for $ab$ to be odd\nThe product $ab$ will be odd if both $a$ and $b$ are odd. This means that both $a$ and $b$ must be chosen from the set $\\{1,3,5\\}$. There are $3$ possible choices for each of $a$ and $b$, resulting in a total of $3 \\times 3 = 9$ pairs $(a,b)$ that make $ab$ odd.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of possibilities for $ab$ to be even\nSince there are $25$ possible pairs $(a,b)$ in total, and $9$ of them make $ab$ odd, the number of pairs $(a,b)$ that make $ab$ even is $25 - 9 = 16$.\n\n## Step 6: Identify when $c$ is even\n$c$ is even when it is chosen from the set $\\{2,4\\}$, so there are $2$ possibilities for $c$ to be even.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of possibilities for $ab+c$ to be even\nWe have two cases:\n\n- Case 1: $ab$ is even. In this case, $c$ can be any number, so there are $2 + 3 = 5$ possibilities for $c$ to make $ab+c$ even.\n- Case 2: $ab$ is odd, but $c$ is even. In this case, $c$ must be the even number, and there are $9$ possibilities for $ab$ to be odd, so there are $9 \\times 1 = 9$ possibilities in this case.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total number of possibilities for $ab+c$ to be even\nThe total number of possibilities for $ab+c$ to be even is the sum of the possibilities in the two cases, which is $5 \\times 16 + 9 = 109$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the probability that $ab+c$ is even\nThe probability that $ab+c$ is even is the number of possibilities for $ab+c$ to be even divided by the total number of possibilities for $a$, $b$, and $c$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are chosen randomly and with replacement from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\},$ there are $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125$ possible triples $(a,b,c)$. Therefore, the probability that $ab+c$ is even is $\\frac{109}{125}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{109}{125}}$"
