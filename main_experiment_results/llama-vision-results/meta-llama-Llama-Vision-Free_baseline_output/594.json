    "problem": "A palindrome is a number which reads the same forward as backward. How many five-digit palindromes can be made from the digits 1, 2, and 9?  (Each digit may be used more than once.)",
    "solution": "A five-digit palindrome would be of the form $ABCBA$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are digits (not necessarily distinct) from $0$ to $9$ (with $A$ from $1$ to $9$). We have three possibilities for each of $A$, $B$ and $C,$ which gives us $3^3 = \\boxed{27}$ possible palindromes.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the structure of a five-digit palindrome\nA five-digit palindrome has the form abcba, where a, b, and c are digits.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the possible values for the first digit (a)\nThe first digit (a) can be any one of the three digits 1, 2, or 9. So, there are 3 choices for a.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the possible values for the second and third digits (b and c)\nThe second and third digits (b and c) can be any one of the three digits 1, 2, or 9. So, there are 3 choices for b and 3 choices for c.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of five-digit palindromes\nTo find the total number of five-digit palindromes, we multiply the number of choices for each digit. Therefore, the total number of five-digit palindromes is 3 x 3 x 3 = 27.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$"
