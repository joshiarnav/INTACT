    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the pattern of the list.\nThe numbers in the list increase by 4 each time.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the starting and ending numbers in the list.\nThe first number in the list is 6 and the last number is 86.\n\n## Step 3: Find the difference between the first and last numbers.\nTo find the difference, subtract the first number from the last number: 86 - 6 = 80.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of steps between the first and last numbers.\nSince each step increases by 4, we can divide the difference by 4: 80 / 4 = 20.\n\n## Step 5: Add 1 to the number of steps to find the total number of numbers in the list.\nSince we are counting the first number as well, we add 1 to the number of steps: 20 + 1 = 21.\n\n## Step 6: Write the final answer.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$"
