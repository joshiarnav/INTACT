    "problem": "How many ways are there to answer a $10$-question true/false test, where at least $3$ of the questions have been answered with a false?",
    "solution": "There are $2^{10} = 1024$ ways to answer the questions on the true/false test. However, we can also compute the number of ways of answering the questions on the true/false test by using combinations; there are $\\binom{10}{k}$ ways to answer $k$ of the questions on the test with a false, so we have: $$\\binom{10}{0} + \\binom{10}{1} + \\cdots + \\binom{10}{9} + \\binom{10}{10} = 2^{10}.$$ The desired answer is \\begin{align*}\n&\\binom{10}{3} + \\binom{10}{4} + \\cdots + \\binom{10}{9} + \\binom{10}{10} \\\\\n=\\text{ }&2^{10} - \\binom{10}{0} - \\binom{10}{1} - \\binom{10}{2} = 1024 - 1 - 10 - 45 \\\\\n=\\text{ }&\\boxed{968}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the conditions given. We have a 10-question true/false test, and we want to find the number of ways to answer the test such that at least 3 of the questions have been answered with a false.\n## Step 2:  We can start by finding the total number of ways to answer the test without any restrictions. Since each question can be answered in 2 ways (true or false), there are $2^{10} = 1024$ ways to answer the test with no restrictions.\n## Step 3:  Now, we need to find the number of ways to answer the test such that 0, 1, or 2 questions are answered with a false. This will help us find the number of ways to answer the test with at least 3 false answers by subtracting these cases from the total.\n## Step 4:  We can use the combination formula to find the number of ways to answer the test with 0, 1, or 2 false answers. The combination formula is given by $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of questions and $k$ is the number of false answers.\n## Step 5:  To find the number of ways to answer the test with 0 false answers, we use $\\binom{10}{0} = 1$, because there is only one way to answer all questions as true.\n## Step 6:  To find the number of ways to answer the test with 1 false answer, we use $\\binom{10}{1} = 10$, because there are 10 ways to choose 1 question out of 10 to be answered as false.\n## Step 7:  To find the number of ways to answer the test with 2 false answers, we use $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$, because there are 45 ways to choose 2 questions out of 10 to be answered as false.\n## Step 8:  Now, we subtract the sum of these cases from the total number of ways to answer the test with no restrictions to find the number of ways to answer the test with at least 3 false answers.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the total number of ways to answer the test with at least 3 false answers is $1024 - (1 + 10 + 45)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{968}$"
