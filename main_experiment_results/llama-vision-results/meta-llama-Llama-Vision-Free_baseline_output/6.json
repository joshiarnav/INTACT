    "problem": "How many (non-congruent) isosceles triangles exist which have a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the measure of the each of the equal sides.  Since the perimeter is 10 units, the side lengths measure $x$, $x$, and $10-2x$ units.  Since the third side length must be positive, we have $10-2x>0$ which implies $x<5$.  By the triangle inequality, the sum of the two equal sides must exceed the third side.  Solving  $x+x>10-2x$ gives $x>2.5$.  There are $\\boxed{2}$ integers strictly between 2.5 and 5.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand what an isosceles triangle is.\nAn isosceles triangle has at least two sides of equal length.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the constraints for the side lengths of the triangle.\nSince the perimeter of the triangle is 10, the sum of the lengths of its three sides must be 10.\n\n## Step 3: List all the possible sets of three integers that add up to 10.\nThese sets are: (1, 1, 8), (1, 2, 7), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 5), and (2, 2, 6), (2, 3, 5), and (3, 3, 4).\n\n## Step 4: Eliminate sets that do not form valid triangles.\nTo eliminate sets, we must apply the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the triangle inequality to each set of possible side lengths.\nFor the set (1, 1, 8), 1 + 1 < 8, so this set does not form a valid triangle. For the set (1, 2, 7), 1 + 2 < 7, so this set does not form a valid triangle. For the set (1, 3, 6), 1 + 3 < 6, so this set does not form a valid triangle. For the set (1, 4, 5), 1 + 4 > 5, 4 + 5 > 1, and 1 + 5 > 4, so this set forms a valid triangle. For the set (2, 2, 6), 2 + 2 < 6, so this set does not form a valid triangle. For the set (2, 3, 5), 2 + 3 > 5, 3 + 5 > 2, and 2 + 5 > 3, so this set forms a valid triangle. For the set (3, 3, 4), 3 + 3 > 4, 3 + 4 > 3, and 3 + 4 > 3, so this set forms a valid triangle.\n\n## Step 6: Count the number of non-congruent isosceles triangles.\nWe found three sets that form valid triangles: (1, 4, 5), (2, 3, 5), and (3, 3, 4).\n\n## Step 7: Provide the final answer.\nThere are 3 non-congruent isosceles triangles that have a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
