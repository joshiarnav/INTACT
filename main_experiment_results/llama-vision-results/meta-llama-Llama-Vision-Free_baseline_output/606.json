    "problem": "Three cards are dealt at random from a standard deck (13 clubs, 13 diamonds, 13 hearts, and 13 spades) of 52 cards.  What is the probability that all three cards are $\\heartsuit$s?",
    "solution": "The probability is $\\dfrac{13}{52} \\times \\dfrac{12}{51} \\times \\dfrac{11}{50} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{850}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from a deck of 52.\nTo find the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from a deck of 52, we use the combination formula: $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial. So, the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from 52 is $C(52, 3) = \\frac{52!}{3!(52-3)!}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from 52.\nWe calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from 52 using the formula from step 1: $C(52, 3) = \\frac{52!}{3!49!} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 22100$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to choose 3 hearts from the 13 hearts in the deck.\nTo find the number of ways to choose 3 hearts from 13 hearts, we use the combination formula: $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where n is the total number of hearts, k is the number of hearts to choose, and ! denotes factorial. So, the number of ways to choose 3 hearts from 13 is $C(13, 3) = \\frac{13!}{3!(13-3)!}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 hearts from 13.\nWe calculate the number of ways to choose 3 hearts from 13 using the formula from step 3: $C(13, 3) = \\frac{13!}{3!10!} = \\frac{13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 286$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that all three cards are hearts.\nTo find the probability that all three cards are hearts, we divide the number of ways to choose 3 hearts from 13 by the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from 52.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability.\nWe calculate the probability by dividing the number of ways to choose 3 hearts from 13 by the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from 52: $\\frac{286}{22100}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction to obtain the probability.\nSimplifying the fraction $\\frac{286}{22100}$, we get $\\frac{11}{850}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{850}}$"
