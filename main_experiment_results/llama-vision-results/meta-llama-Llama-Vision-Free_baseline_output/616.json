    "problem": "There are 8 pens along a wall in the pound.  The pound has to allocate 4 pens to dogs, 3 to cats, and one to roosters.  In how many ways can the pound make the allocation?",
    "solution": "There are $8!$ ways to arrange 8 allocations to the pens if they are not identical, but we must divide by $4!$ for the four dog pen allocations and divide by $3!$ for the three cat pen allocations.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{8!}{4! \\times 3!} = \\boxed{280}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to select 4 pens for dogs from 8 pens.\nTo find the number of ways to select 4 pens out of 8 for the dogs, we use the combination formula: C(8,4) = 8! / (4! * (8-4)!).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to select 3 pens for cats from the remaining 4 pens.\nAfter allocating pens to the dogs, there are 4 pens left. We need to calculate how many ways we can select 3 pens out of these 4 for the cats. This is given by the combination formula: C(4,3) = 4! / (3! * (4-3)!).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to select 1 pen for roosters from the remaining pens.\nOnce the pens are allocated to dogs and cats, there are 1 pen left. Since we are only choosing 1 pen out of 1, there is only 1 way to do this, given by C(1,1) = 1.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways to make the allocation.\nThe total number of ways to make the allocation is the product of the ways to select pens for each type of animal.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the arithmetic to find the total number of ways to make the allocation.\nWe will perform the actual arithmetic for each step:\n- C(8,4) = 8! / (4! * 4!) = 70\n- C(4,3) = 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4\n- The total number of ways is C(8,4) * C(4,3) * C(1,1) = 70 * 4 * 1 = 280\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{280}$"
