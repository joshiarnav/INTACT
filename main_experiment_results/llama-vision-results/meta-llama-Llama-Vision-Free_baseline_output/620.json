    "solution": "There are nine possible products, as there are three different numbers upon which the first spinner could land and three different numbers upon which the second spinner could land. If the first spinner lands on $-3$ or $-1$, the second spinner can land on either 2 or 4 to create a negative product, giving four possibilities. If the first spinner lands on the 5, the second spinner must land on the $-6$ to create a negative product. Thus, there are five possible ways to create a negative product, so the probability that the product of the values is negative is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are given two circles with spinners at their centers, each divided into three equal regions. We need to find the probability that the product of the two values obtained by spinning both spinners is negative.\n## Step 2:  To solve this, we can first enumerate all the possible outcomes when both spinners are spun. Each spinner has 3 equal sections, so when both are spun, there are a total of $3 \\times 3 = 9$ possible outcomes.\n## Step 3:  Now, we need to identify the combinations that result in a negative product. This occurs when one spinner shows a positive value and the other shows a negative value.\n## Step 4:  There are three negative values on the first spinner (-3, -6, -4) and two positive values on the second spinner (2, 5). Therefore, there are $3 \\times 2 = 6$ outcomes where the product is negative.\n## Step 5:  Now that we have the number of successful outcomes, we can calculate the probability of getting a negative product by dividing the number of successful outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{6}{9} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$"
