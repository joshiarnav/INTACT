    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what constitutes a rectangle in the given array.\n## Step 2:  A rectangle can be formed by drawing any four lines connecting the horizontal and vertical grid lines that intersect at a right angle.\n## Step 3:  We are given an array with 9 grid points, and we want to find the total number of rectangles in this array.\n## Step 4:  The array contains different sizes and orientations of rectangles, including $1$ by $1$, $2$ by $2$, $\\sqrt{2}$ by $\\sqrt{2}$ (on the diagonal), $1$ by $2$, $1$ by $3$, and $2$ by $3$ rectangles.\n## Step 5:  We can calculate the number of rectangles of each size and then add them up to find the total number of rectangles in the array.\n## Step 6:  Let's start by counting the number of $1$ by $1$ squares. Since there are $9$ grid points, we can form $9$ such squares.\n## Step 7:  Moving on to $2$ by $2$ squares, we can fit $4$ of these squares within the array.\n## Step 8:  Next, we consider the $\\sqrt{2}$ by $\\sqrt{2}$ squares. There are $4$ such squares in the given array.\n## Step 9:  For $1$ by $2$ rectangles, we can fit $6$ of these rectangles within the array.\n## Step 10:  Similarly, we can fit $6$ $1$ by $3$ rectangles and $2$ $2$ by $3$ rectangles in the array.\n## Step 11:  Now, we can add up the counts of all these different types of rectangles to find the total number of rectangles in the array.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, the total number of rectangles in the array is $9 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 6 + 2 = 31$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{31}$"
