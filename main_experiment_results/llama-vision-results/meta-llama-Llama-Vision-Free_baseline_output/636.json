    "problem": "Pat wants to select 8 pieces of fruit to bring in the car for the people he's driving to Montana with. He randomly chooses each piece of fruit to be an orange, an apple, or a banana. What is the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples?",
    "solution": "It is impossible for Pat to select both 3 oranges and 6 apples, so we can calculate the probabilities of these mutually exclusive cases separately and then add to get our final answer. The probability that 3 particular pieces of fruit will be oranges and the rest will not be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^5=\\dfrac{32}{6561}$, and there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways of selecting three pieces of fruit to be the oranges so the probability that 3 will be oranges is $56\\cdot\\dfrac{32}{6561}=\\dfrac{1792}{6561}$. Similarly, the probability that 6 particular pieces of fruit will be apples and the other two won't be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^6\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{6561}$ and there are $\\binom{8}{6}=28$ ways of selecting which ones will be the apples, so multiplying again gives us a probability of $28\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{6561}=\\dfrac{112}{6561}$. Adding those two probabilities give us our final answer: $\\dfrac{1792}{6561}+\\dfrac{112}{6561}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1904}{6561}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes for choosing 8 pieces of fruit from 3 types (orange, apple, banana).\nThe total number of outcomes is calculated using the formula for combinations with repetitions allowed, which in this case simplifies to 3^8 since for each piece of fruit, there are 3 choices.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 oranges out of 8 pieces of fruit.\nThis can be calculated using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial. For exactly 3 oranges, we use C(8, 3).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 6 apples out of 8 pieces of fruit.\nSimilarly, for exactly 6 apples, we use C(8, 6).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining fruits for each scenario.\nFor exactly 3 oranges, the remaining 5 pieces of fruit must be either apples or bananas, so we calculate the number of ways to choose this using C(5, k) where k can be either 0 or 5 (since we're only considering scenarios of exactly 3 oranges and exactly 6 apples combined, not mixed). For exactly 6 apples, the remaining 2 pieces of fruit must be either oranges or bananas, so we calculate the number of ways to choose this using C(2, k) where k can be either 0 or 2.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining fruits for the scenario of exactly 3 oranges.\nSince we are choosing exactly 3 oranges, the remaining 5 fruits can be any combination of apples and bananas. This calculation will be the product of choosing 5 fruits out of the remaining 5 places with either apple or banana, which is 2^5, considering each of the 5 spots can be either an apple or a banana.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining fruits for the scenario of exactly 6 apples.\nSince we are choosing exactly 6 apples, the remaining 2 fruits can be either oranges or bananas. This calculation will be the product of choosing 2 fruits out of the remaining 2 places with either orange or banana, which is 2^2, considering each of the 2 spots can be either an orange or a banana.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 oranges and the number of ways to choose exactly 6 apples.\nUsing the combination formula, C(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 56 ways to choose exactly 3 oranges.\nUsing the combination formula, C(8, 6) = 8! / (6!(8-6)!) = 28 ways to choose exactly 6 apples.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining fruits for exactly 3 oranges and exactly 6 apples.\nFor exactly 3 oranges, we have 2^5 = 32 ways to choose the remaining fruits.\nFor exactly 6 apples, we have 2^2 = 4 ways to choose the remaining fruits.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the total number of favorable outcomes by multiplying the number of ways to choose exactly 3 oranges and the number of ways to choose the remaining fruits, and the same for exactly 6 apples.\nFor exactly 3 oranges, the total number of favorable outcomes is 56 * 32 = 1792.\nFor exactly 6 apples, the total number of favorable outcomes is 28 * 4 = 112.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes for choosing 8 pieces of fruit from 3 types.\nThe total number of outcomes is 3^8 = 6561.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the probability of either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit being oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit being apples.\nThe probability is the total number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, (1792 + 112) / 6561.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the expression to get the final probability.\nThe probability = (1904) / 6561.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1904}{6561}}$"
