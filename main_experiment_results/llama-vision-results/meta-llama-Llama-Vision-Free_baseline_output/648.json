    "problem": "A bag contains 12 red marbles and 6 blue marbles. Two marbles are selected at random and without replacement. What is the probability that one marble is red and one is blue? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "If a red marble is chosen first ($\\frac{12}{18}=\\frac{2}{3}$ chance), then there is a $\\frac{6}{17}$ chance that a blue marble will be chosen second. If a blue marble is chosen first ($\\frac{6}{18}=\\frac{1}{3}$ chance), then there is a $\\frac{12}{17}$ chance that a red marble will be chosen second. The total probability that one red and one blue marble will be chosen is $\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{6}{17}+\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{12}{17}=\\boxed{\\frac{8}{17}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of marbles in the bag.\nThe total number of marbles in the bag is the sum of red and blue marbles, which is 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the total number of ways to select two marbles from the bag without replacement.\nThe total number of ways to select two marbles from 18 without replacement is given by the combination formula C(18, 2), which is calculated as 18! / (2! * (18-2)!).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of ways to select two marbles using the combination formula.\n18! / (2! * 16!) = (18 * 17) / (2 * 1) = 9 * 17 = 153.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes, where one marble is red and one is blue.\nThe number of red marbles is 12 and the number of blue marbles is 6. The number of ways to select one red marble and one blue marble is the product of the number of ways to select one red marble and the number of ways to select one blue marble, which is C(12, 1) * C(6, 1).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to select one red marble and one blue marble using the combination formula.\nC(12, 1) = 12, and C(6, 1) = 6. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 12 * 6 = 72.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of selecting one red marble and one blue marble.\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 72 / 153.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction to its simplest form.\nTo simplify the fraction 72 / 153, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 72 and 153.\n\n## Step 8: Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 72 and 153.\nThe factors of 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72 and the factors of 153 are 1, 3, 9, 17, 51, 153. The greatest common factor is 9.\n\n## Step 9: Divide both the numerator and denominator by the greatest common divisor to simplify the fraction.\n72 / 9 = 8 and 153 / 9 = 17. Therefore, the simplified fraction is 8 / 17.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{17}}$"
