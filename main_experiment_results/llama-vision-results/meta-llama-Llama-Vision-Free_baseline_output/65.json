    "problem": "Beth rolls a fair six-sided die. If she rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar, but if she rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar. If she rolls 1 nothing happens. What is the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are 3 possible prime numbers which can be rolled (2, 3, and 5), and two possible composite numbers which can be rolled (4 and 6). Each number has a $\\dfrac{1}{6}$ chance of being rolled. So, the expected value of Beth's winnings is $$\\frac{3}{6}(1)+\\frac{2}{6}(-1)+\\frac{1}{6}(0)=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the possible outcomes when rolling a fair six-sided die.\nThe possible outcomes when rolling a fair six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the prime and composite numbers among the outcomes.\nThe prime numbers among the outcomes are 2, 3, and 5. The composite numbers among the outcomes are 4 and 6. The number 1 is neither prime nor composite, so nothing happens when it's rolled.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of each outcome.\nSince the die is fair, each outcome has an equal probability of $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the winnings for each outcome.\nBeth wins 1 dollar for rolling a prime number (2, 3, 5) and loses 1 dollar for rolling a composite number (4, 6). If she rolls a 1, nothing happens.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win.\nExpected value = (probability of rolling a 2) * (winnings for 2) + (probability of rolling a 3) * (winnings for 3) + (probability of rolling a 4) * (winnings for 4) + (probability of rolling a 5) * (winnings for 5) + (probability of rolling a 6) * (winnings for 6) + (probability of rolling a 1) * (winnings for 1)\nExpected value = ($\\frac{1}{6}$)(1) + ($\\frac{1}{6}$)(1) + ($\\frac{1}{6}$)(-1) + ($\\frac{1}{6}$)(1) + ($\\frac{1}{6}$)(-1) + ($\\frac{1}{6}$)(0)\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expected value expression.\nExpected value = $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} + 0$\nExpected value = $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{6}$\nExpected value = $\\frac{2}{6} - \\frac{2}{6}$\nExpected value = $\\frac{0}{6}$\nExpected value = 0\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"
