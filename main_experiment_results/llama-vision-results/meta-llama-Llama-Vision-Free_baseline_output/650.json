    "problem": "Our basketball team has 10 players.  We need to divide into two teams of 5 for an intra-squad scrimmage.  In how many ways can we do this without restrictions?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{10}{5} = 252$ ways to choose players for the first team, and the second team gets the remaining players.  However, since the teams are interchangeable, we must divide by two, so the answer is $252 / 2 = \\boxed{126}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and what is being asked.\nWe are tasked with finding the number of ways to divide a basketball team of 10 players into two teams of 5 for an intra-squad scrimmage without any restrictions.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to select the first team of 5 players.\nTo divide the team into two groups of 5, we can start by selecting the first team of 5 players. This can be done using combinations, specifically \"10 choose 5,\" which calculates the number of ways to choose 5 players out of 10 without regard to order.\n\n## Step 3: Recognize that selecting the first team automatically determines the second team.\nAfter selecting the first team of 5 players, the remaining 5 players automatically form the second team. Therefore, we do not need to calculate the number of ways to select the second team separately.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate \"10 choose 5\" to determine the number of ways to divide the team.\nThe formula for combinations is \"n choose r\" = n! / [r!(n - r)!], where \"n\" is the total number of items, and \"r\" is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 10 and r = 5.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the combination formula.\nCalculate \"10 choose 5\" using the combination formula: 10! / [5!(10 - 5)!] = 10! / (5! * 5!).\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the factorials and simplify the expression.\n10! = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1,\n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, and\n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the combination formula with factorials.\n10! / (5! * 5!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).\n\n## Step 8: Perform the arithmetic to find the number of combinations.\n(10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) = 30240, and\n(5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 120.\n\n## Step 9: Divide to find the final number of combinations.\n30240 / 120 = 252.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{252}$"
