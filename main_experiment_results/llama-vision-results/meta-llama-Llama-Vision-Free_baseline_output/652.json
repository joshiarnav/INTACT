    "problem": "Matt and Ryan are playing an exciting round of Rock Paper Scissors: The Collectible Card Game. Matt is convinced that Rock can beat anything, so his deck consists only of 8 Rock cards.   Ryan's deck consists of 5 Paper cards and 3 Scissors cards.  In the game, Matt randomly selects 3 cards from his deck and places them on the table.  Ryan then randomly selects 3 cards and places one on each of Matt's cards.  If Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock, then what's the probability that Ryan beats Matt in a landslide by choosing 3 Paper cards in a row?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ equally likely ways for Ryan to pick 3 of his 8 cards to play. There are are $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways for those 3 cards to be 3 of his 5 paper cards. So, the probability that he picks 3 paper cards  is $\\frac{\\text{successful outcomes}}{\\text{total equally-likely outcomes}} = \\frac{10}{56}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{28}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of ways Matt can select 3 cards from his 8 Rock cards.\nMatt has 8 Rock cards, and he needs to select 3 of them. This can be calculated using combinations, specifically \"8 choose 3\". The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial. So, the total number of ways Matt can select 3 Rock cards is C(8, 3).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate C(8, 3) to get the total number of Matt's selections.\nC(8, 3) = 8! / [3!(8-3)!] = 8! / (3! * 5!) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 56.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the total number of ways Ryan can select 3 cards from his deck.\nRyan has 5 Paper cards and 3 Scissors cards, making a total of 8 cards. He needs to select 3 cards. This can also be calculated using combinations, specifically \"8 choose 3\".\n\n## Step 4: Calculate C(8, 3) to get the total number of Ryan's selections.\nFollowing the same calculation as step 2, C(8, 3) = 56.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the number of ways Ryan can select 3 Paper cards from his deck.\nRyan has 5 Paper cards, and he needs to select 3 of them. This can be calculated using combinations, specifically \"5 choose 3\".\n\n## Step 6: Calculate C(5, 3) to get the number of Ryan's selections of 3 Paper cards.\nC(5, 3) = 5! / [3!(5-3)!] = 5! / (3! * 2!) = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1) = 10.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability that Ryan beats Matt in a landslide by choosing 3 Paper cards in a row.\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes (Ryan selecting 3 Paper cards) divided by the total number of outcomes. The number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways Ryan can select 3 Paper cards, which is 10. The total number of outcomes is the total number of ways Matt can select 3 cards multiplied by the total number of ways Ryan can select 3 cards, which is 56 * 56.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total number of outcomes.\nTotal outcomes = 56 * 56 = 3136.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the probability.\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes = 10 / 3136.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the fraction to calculate the final probability.\n10 / 3136 = 5 / 1568.\n\n## Step 11: Since the format requires a numerical answer, simplify the fraction further if possible.\nThe final fraction 5 / 1568 cannot be simplified further into a whole number or a simpler fraction without a calculator.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{1568}}$"
