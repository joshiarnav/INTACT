    "problem": "A player pays $\\$5$ to play a game. A six-sided die is rolled. If the number on the die is odd, the game is lost. If the number on the die is even, the die is rolled again. In this case the player wins some amount of money if the second number matches the first and loses otherwise. How much money should the player win if the game is fair? (In a fair game the probability of winning times the amount won is what the player should pay.)",
    "solution": "Let $x$ represent the amount the player wins if the game is fair.  The chance of an even number is $1/2$, and the chance of matching this number on the second roll is $1/6$. So the probability of winning is $(1/2)(1/6)=1/12$. Therefore $(1/12)x=\\$5$ and $x=\\boxed{60}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, we need to calculate the probability of winning the game, which includes the scenarios of rolling an even number on the first die and then matching it on the second roll.\n## Step 2:  There are two possible even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. Thus, the probability of rolling an even number on the first die is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n## Step 3:  If an even number is rolled, the die is rolled again. In this case, the probability of matching the first number is $\\frac{1}{6}$ because there is only one way to match the first number out of the six possible outcomes.\n## Step 4:  So, the overall probability of winning is the product of the probability of rolling an even number on the first die and the probability of matching it on the second roll, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\n## Step 5:  Since the game is fair, the probability of winning times the amount won should equal the cost of playing the game, which is $\\$5$.\n## Step 6:  Let $x$ be the amount of money the player should win if the game is fair. Then the equation becomes $\\frac{1}{12}x = 5$.\n## Step 7:  To solve for $x$, we multiply both sides of the equation by $12$, giving us $x = 5 \\cdot 12$.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the amount of money the player should win if the game is fair is $x = 60$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{60}$"
