    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of steps required to reach point B from point C, and understand the constraints of movement which is only up or to the right.\n## Step 2:  The path from C to B involves 4 steps to the right and 2 steps upwards, totaling 6 steps.\n## Step 3:  We can think of this problem as arranging the 4 steps to the right and 2 steps upwards in a sequence, where the order matters. This is a combinatorics problem that can be solved using combinations with repetitions.\n## Step 4:  The total number of steps is 6, out of which 4 steps are to the right and 2 steps are upwards. We need to choose 2 out of these 6 steps to be upwards, and the remaining 4 steps will naturally be to the right.\n## Step 5:  The number of ways to choose 2 steps out of 6 to be upwards can be calculated using the combination formula $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of steps and $r$ is the number of steps to be chosen.\n## Step 6:  Substituting the values, we get $\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
