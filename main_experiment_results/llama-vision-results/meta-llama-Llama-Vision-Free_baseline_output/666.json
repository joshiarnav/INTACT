    "problem": "The Greek army contained two types of soldiers: the upper class and the lower class soldiers. If there were a total of 5 upper class soldiers, and 10 lower class soldiers in a certain part of Athens, and the battle of Thermopylae demands a force of 4 upper class soldiers and 8 lower class soldiers, how many different battalions can be sent?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{4}$ different ways to choose 4 from 5 upper class soldiers. For each of these, there are $\\binom{10}{8}$ ways to choose 8 lower class soldiers. The number of different battalions, then, is $\\binom{5}{4}\\cdot \\binom{10}{8} = \\boxed{225}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the maximum number of battalions that can be formed with the available upper class soldiers.\nTo form a battalion, we need 4 upper class soldiers. We have 5 upper class soldiers available. The maximum number of battalions that can be formed is the integer part of the division of the total number of upper class soldiers by the number of upper class soldiers required for each battalion, which is 5 / 4 = 1.25. So, we can form 1 battalion with the available upper class soldiers.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the maximum number of battalions that can be formed with the available lower class soldiers.\nTo form a battalion, we need 8 lower class soldiers. We have 10 lower class soldiers available. The maximum number of battalions that can be formed is the integer part of the division of the total number of lower class soldiers by the number of lower class soldiers required for each battalion, which is 10 / 8 = 1.25. So, we can form 1 battalion with the available lower class soldiers.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the limiting factor for forming battalions.\nSince both types of soldiers are available in limited quantities and each battalion requires a specific number of each type, we must identify the limiting factor. In this case, the number of battalions that can be formed is limited by the smaller integer part of the division of the available soldiers by the soldiers required for each battalion. Here, both the upper class and lower class soldiers allow for only 1 battalion to be formed based on their availability. However, the key is to realize that the limiting factor for forming complete battalions is actually the smallest quotient obtained in the division which is 1 for both upper and lower class soldiers.\n\n## Step 4: Consider if the limiting factor allows for the formation of more than one battalion.\nGiven that the limiting factor for both upper and lower class soldiers is 1, it means we can only form 1 complete battalion with the available soldiers, as there won't be enough of either type to form more than one battalion that meets the 4:8 ratio.\n\n## Step 5: Consider if the remaining soldiers can be used to form additional battalions.\nFor the upper class soldiers, we can only form 1 battalion since we have 5 upper class soldiers and need 4 for each battalion. We will have 1 upper class soldier left over. For the lower class soldiers, we can only form 1 battalion since we have 10 lower class soldiers and need 8 for each battalion. We will have 2 lower class soldiers left over. Since these leftover soldiers do not meet the required ratio for forming another complete battalion, we cannot form additional battalions with the remaining soldiers.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the total number of different battalions that can be sent.\nGiven that we can form only 1 complete battalion with the available upper and lower class soldiers, and we cannot form additional battalions with the leftover soldiers, the total number of different battalions that can be sent is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
