    "solution": "On her first turn, Kendra must get 10 points.  If she wants a total of 30 after three turns, she must then either get two tens in a row or a 5 and then a 15.  To get three tens in a row, she can move any direction on her first move, go in two possible directions for her second move, and go in two possible directions for her third spin, meaning her probability of success is $\\frac{1}{4}$.  On the other hand, if she wants to get a 10, a 5, and a 15, she can only move left or right on her first move, further out on her second move, and then up or down on her third move, leading to a probability of success of $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{16}$.  Adding, her total probability is $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$.",

However, we also need to ensure that Kendra ends up at the space labeled 20.\n## Step 7:  This can only happen in the following cases: (10, 10, 10), (20, 5, 5), (5, 20, 5), or (5, 5, 20).\n## Step 8:  We can then calculate the total number of ways to reach each of these cases.\n## Step 9:  For the case (10, 10, 10), there are $4^3 = 64$ ways to reach this case.\n## Step 10:  For the cases (20, 5, 5), (5, 20, 5), and (5, 5, 20), there are $4 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 32$ ways to reach each case, as there are 4 ways to get the 20 and 4 ways to get the 5's, and 2 different orders for the 5's.\n## Step 11:  By summing up the total number of ways to reach each case, we get $64 + 32 \\times 3 = 160$ ways to reach a sum of 30.\n## Step 12:  With each spin having a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$, the probability of reaching a sum of 30 is $\\frac{160}{4^3} = \\frac{160}{64} = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n## Step 13:  However, we need to consider that Kendra can only land on the space labeled 20 in the specified cases, so we need to adjust the probability accordingly.\n## Step 14:  Therefore, the correct probability is $\\frac{5}{32}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{32}}$"
