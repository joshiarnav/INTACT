    "problem": "There are eight boys and six girls who are members of the trumpet section in the band. From the members of the trumpet section, a quintet is being formed. If the quintet must consist of three boys and two girls, how many quintets are possible?",
    "solution": "First, we consider how many ways there are to choose three boys from eight. There are $8$ choices for the first boy, $7$ for the second, and $6$ for the third. However, because the boys are indistinct from one another, we have overcounted, and must divide by $3 \\cdot 2$. Similarly, there are $6 \\cdot 5$ ways to choose the two girls, divided by $2$ for overcounting. Thus, there are $\\frac{8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2} = \\boxed{840}$ possible quintets.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 8 boys.\nThe number of ways to choose 3 boys from 8 boys can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of boys (8) and r is the number of boys to be chosen (3).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 6 girls.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 girls from 6 girls can also be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of girls (6) and r is the number of girls to be chosen (2).\n\n## Step 3: Multiply the number of ways to choose 3 boys and 2 girls.\nTo find the total number of quintets possible, we need to multiply the number of ways to choose 3 boys and 2 girls. This is because for each selection of 3 boys, there are multiple selections of 2 girls, and vice versa.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of combinations for boys.\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 8! / (3!5!) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1) = 56.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of combinations for girls.\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 6! / (2!4!) = (6*5) / (2*1) = 15.\n\n## Step 6: Multiply the number of combinations for boys and girls.\nTotal combinations = C(8, 3) * C(6, 2) = 56 * 15 = 840.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{840}$"
