    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if the three E's are unique, which is $5!$. Then since the E's are not unique, we divide by $3!$ for the arrangements of E, for an answer of $\\dfrac{5!}{3!} = \\boxed{20}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Count the total number of letters in the word TEPEE.\nThe word TEPEE has 5 letters.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of repetitions of each letter in the word TEPEE.\nThere are 2 Es and 2 Ps, and the other letters appear once.\n\n## Step 3: Use the formula for permutations with repetitions to calculate the total number of arrangements.\nThe formula for permutations with repetitions is the total number of letters factorial divided by the product of the factorials of the number of repetitions for each repeated letter. In this case, the total number of arrangements = 5! / (2! * 2!).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the factorial of 5.\n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the factorial of 2 for the repetitions of E and P.\n2! = 2 * 1 = 2.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of arrangements by dividing the factorial of 5 by the product of the factorials of 2 for the repetitions of E and P.\nTotal arrangements = 5! / (2! * 2!) = 120 / (2 * 2) = 30.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$"
