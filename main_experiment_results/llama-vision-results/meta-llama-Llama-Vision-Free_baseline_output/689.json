    "solution": "The distances between corners of a unit cube are 1, $\\sqrt{2}$, and $\\sqrt{3}$. If the two shortest sides are 1 and 1, the third side has to be $\\sqrt{2}$. If the two shortest sides are 1 and $\\sqrt{2}$, the third side must be $\\sqrt{3}$. If the two shortest sides are $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{2}$, the third side must also be $\\sqrt{2}$. There is no case where the shortest side is $\\sqrt{3}$. This gives $\\boxed{3}$ non-congruent triangles.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the problem\nWe need to find the number of non-congruent triangles that can be drawn such that their vertices lie on the corners of a unit cube.\n\n## Step 2: Identifying the number of vertices of a unit cube\nA unit cube has 8 vertices, which can serve as the corners to form the triangles.\n\n## Step 3: Considering the different types of triangles\nWe can form triangles using 3 vertices. We should consider the different types of triangles that can be formed, including those with vertices on adjacent faces, opposite faces, and diagonals of the cube.\n\n## Step 4: Calculating the number of triangles with vertices on adjacent faces\nThere are 8 vertices on the cube, and each vertex is connected to 3 adjacent vertices. However, we should not count each triangle twice, as they can be formed in two different orders. Therefore, the number of triangles with vertices on adjacent faces is (8 * 3) / 2 = 12.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the number of triangles with vertices on opposite faces\nWe can select 2 opposite vertices on the cube, which will determine the third vertex. There are 4 pairs of opposite vertices, resulting in 4 triangles.\n\n## Step 6: Calculating the number of triangles with vertices on diagonals of the cube\nWe can choose 3 vertices diagonally, which will form a triangle. There are 4 such triangles.\n\n## Step 7: Calculating the total number of non-congruent triangles\nWe need to sum up the number of triangles with vertices on adjacent faces, opposite faces, and diagonals of the cube. The total number of non-congruent triangles is 12 + 4 + 4 = 20.\n\n## Step 8: Considering the degenerate triangles\nWe should verify if there are any degenerate triangles formed by the vertices of the cube. However, there are no such triangles in this case.\n\n## Step 9: Finalizing the solution\nAfter considering all the possible types of triangles, we can conclude that there are 20 non-congruent triangles that can be drawn such that their vertices lie on the corners of a unit cube.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$"
