    "problem": "A club has 20 members, 12 boys and 8 girls.  Two of the members are chosen at random.  What is the probability that a boy and a girl are chosen?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{20}{2} = 190$ ways to choose two members of the group. There are $12$ ways to choose a boy and $8$ ways to choose a girl for a total of $12 \\cdot 8 = 96$ ways to choose a boy and a girl.  This means that there is a $\\dfrac{96}{190} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{48}{95}}$ chance that the two random members of the group are a boy and a girl.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 members out of 20.\nTo find the total number of ways to choose 2 members out of 20, we use the combination formula: $\\binom{n}{r}=\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items and $r$ is the number of items to choose. In this case, $n=20$ and $r=2$. Substituting these values into the formula, we get: $\\binom{20}{2}=\\frac{20!}{2!(20-2)!}=\\frac{20*19}{2}=190$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 1 boy out of 12.\nTo choose 1 boy out of 12, we use the combination formula: $\\binom{n}{r}=\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of boys and $r$ is the number of boys to choose. In this case, $n=12$ and $r=1$. Substituting these values into the formula, we get: $\\binom{12}{1}=\\frac{12!}{1!(12-1)!}=12$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 1 girl out of 8.\nTo choose 1 girl out of 8, we use the combination formula: $\\binom{n}{r}=\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of girls and $r$ is the number of girls to choose. In this case, $n=8$ and $r=1$. Substituting these values into the formula, we get: $\\binom{8}{1}=\\frac{8!}{1!(8-1)!}=8$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose 1 boy and 1 girl.\nSince the choices of a boy and a girl are independent, we multiply the number of ways to choose 1 boy and 1 girl: $12*8=96$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that a boy and a girl are chosen.\nTo find the probability, we divide the number of ways to choose 1 boy and 1 girl by the total number of ways to choose 2 members: $\\frac{96}{190}=\\frac{48}{95}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{48}{95}}$"
