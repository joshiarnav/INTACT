    "problem": "I coach a soccer team with 15 members.  I want to choose a starting lineup consisting of 11 players, two of whom will represent the team in the captains meeting at the beginning of the game.  In how many ways can I choose my starting lineup, including designating the two captains?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{15}{2}=105$ ways to select the 2 captains from among the 15 players on the team. We then need to choose the remaining 9 starters from among the remaining 13 players, which can be done in $\\binom{13}{9}=715$ ways. This gives us a total of $\\binom{15}{2}\\cdot\\binom{13}{9}=105\\cdot715=\\boxed{75,\\!075}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 11 players from 15\nTo choose a starting lineup of 11 players from a team of 15, we use the combination formula, which is given by nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial. For this step, we calculate 15C11.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate 15C11\n15C11 = 15! / (11! * (15-11)!) = 15! / (11! * 4!) = (15*14*13*12) / (4*3*2*1) = 1365.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 captains from 11 players\nTo choose 2 captains from the 11 players selected, we apply the combination formula again. Here, n = 11 (the number of selected players) and r = 2 (the number of captains to choose). So, we calculate 11C2.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate 11C2\n11C2 = 11! / (2! * (11-2)!) = 11! / (2! * 9!) = (11*10) / (2*1) = 55.\n\n## Step 5: Multiply the results of Step 2 and Step 4 to get the total number of ways to choose the starting lineup and designate the captains\nThe total number of ways is the product of the number of ways to choose the starting lineup and the number of ways to choose the captains. This is calculated as 15C11 * 11C2.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the multiplication\n15C11 * 11C2 = 1365 * 55.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the product\n1365 * 55 = 75075.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{75075}$"
