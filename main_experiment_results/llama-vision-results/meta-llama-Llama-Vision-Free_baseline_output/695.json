    "problem": "Maria has three identical apples and three identical oranges. How many ways are there for her to distribute the fruits among her four friends if she doesn't give Jacky any oranges?  (Note: Maria takes none of the fruit herself, and some of her friends might not receive any fruit at all.)",
    "solution": "First, just consider the apples. Imagine putting three dividers among the apples, so that Maria's first friend gets the apples to the left of the first divider, Maria's second friend gets the apples between the first and second dividers, Maria's third friend gets the apples between the second and third dividers, and Maria's last friend gets the apples after the third divider. With three dividers and three apples, there are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to arrange the dividers. Now, consider the oranges. Since Maria won't give Jacky any oranges, Maria has to distribute the oranges among her other three friends. With three oranges and two dividers, there are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways for Maria to distribute the oranges. The total number of ways for Maria to distribute the fruit is $20\\cdot 10=\\boxed{200}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and constraints\nMaria has 3 identical apples and 3 identical oranges. She cannot distribute any oranges to Jacky. She needs to distribute these fruits among her four friends in such a way that some friends might not receive any fruit.\n\n## Step 2: Distribute the apples first\nSince the oranges have a restriction, let's start by distributing the apples. Each apple can be given to any of the four friends. Since the apples are identical, we only need to consider how many apples each friend receives, not which specific apple. We can represent the distribution of apples as a sequence of 4 numbers, where each number represents how many apples a friend receives.\n\n## Step 3: Distribute the oranges\nAfter distributing the apples, let's consider the distribution of oranges. Since Jacky cannot receive any oranges, each of the other three friends can receive up to 3 oranges. Similarly, we represent the distribution of oranges as a sequence of 3 numbers, where each number represents how many oranges a friend receives.\n\n## Step 4: Find all possible combinations of apple and orange distributions\nWe can distribute 0 to 3 apples to Jacky and then distribute the rest of the apples to the other three friends. This results in 4 possibilities for the number of apples Jacky receives and 4 possibilities for the number of apples each of the other friends receives, giving us 4*4*4=64 possibilities for the apples. Once the apples are distributed, we can then distribute the oranges in 4*3*2=24 ways among the remaining 3 friends.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of ways\nThe total number of ways is the product of the number of ways to distribute the apples and the number of ways to distribute the oranges, which is 64*24=1536.\n\n## Step 6: However, this calculation includes cases where Jacky receives oranges\nSince Jacky cannot receive any oranges, these cases must be subtracted from the total.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of ways to distribute the oranges with Jacky receiving some\nIf Jacky receives some oranges, we can distribute the oranges in the following ways: 1 way for Jacky to receive 1 orange and 6 ways for the remaining 2 oranges to be distributed among the other 3 friends; 1 way for Jacky to receive 2 oranges and 3 ways for the remaining 1 orange to be distributed among the other 3 friends; 1 way for Jacky to receive 3 oranges and there are no ways for the remaining 0 oranges to be distributed among the other 3 friends.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total number of ways with Jacky receiving some oranges\nThere are 1*6+1*3+1*1=10 ways for Jacky to receive some oranges.\n\n## Step 9: Subtract the cases where Jacky receives some oranges from the total\nSubtract the cases where Jacky receives some oranges from the total number of cases. This leaves 1536-10*4=1504 cases.\n\n## Step 10: However, this is not the final answer because we are counting cases where Jacky receives 4 apples\nWe need to subtract these cases as well.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the number of ways to distribute the apples with Jacky receiving 4\nThere is only 1 way to distribute the apples with Jacky receiving 4.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the number of ways to distribute the oranges with Jacky receiving 4 apples\nSince Jacky receives 4 apples, the only possibility is that the other 3 friends receive 0 apples. There are 1 way to distribute the oranges in this case.\n\n## Step 13: Subtract the cases where Jacky receives 4 apples from the total\nSubtract the cases where Jacky receives 4 apples from the total number of cases. This leaves 1504-1=1503 cases.\n\n## Step 14: However, this problem statement is a bit ambiguous and there are cases where some friends receive no oranges. We need to account for this in our final answer.\nWe also need to account for the cases where some friends receive no apples and no oranges.\n\n## Step 15: Calculate the number of ways to distribute the apples and oranges with Jacky receiving 0 apples and 0 oranges\nThere is only 1 way to distribute the apples with Jacky receiving 0 apples. There are 1 ways to distribute the oranges with the remaining 3 friends receiving 0 oranges.\n\n## Step 16: Subtract the cases where Jacky receives 0 apples and 0 oranges from the total\nHowever, this is the only case where Jacky receives 0 apples and 0 oranges.\n\n## Step 17: Calculate the number of ways to distribute the apples and oranges with Jacky receiving 1 apple and 0 oranges\nThere are 4 ways to distribute the apples with Jacky receiving 1 apple.
