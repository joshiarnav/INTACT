    "problem": "A 12-slice pizza was made with only pepperoni and mushroom toppings, and every slice has at least one topping. Only five slices have pepperoni, and exactly eight slices have mushrooms. How many slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms?",
    "solution": "There are 12 total slices, and 5 of them have pepperoni and 8 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number that have both toppings. So, there are $5-n$ slices with only pepperoni and $8-n$ with only mushrooms.  So, there are a total of $n + (5-n) + (8-n)$ slices.  Since there are 12 slices, we have $(5-n) + (8-n) + n = 12$, from which we find that $n=\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Let's denote the total number of slices with pepperoni as P, the total number of slices with mushrooms as M, and the total number of slices with both as B.\n## Step 2:  We know that there are 12 slices in total, with at least one topping on each slice. This means that the number of slices with only pepperoni (P - B) plus the number of slices with only mushrooms (M - B) plus the number of slices with both (B) must equal 12.\n## Step 3:  We are given that only five slices have pepperoni, so P = 5.\n## Step 4:  Similarly, we are told that exactly eight slices have mushrooms, so M = 8.\n## Step 5:  Since every slice has at least one topping, the total number of slices equals the sum of slices with pepperoni and slices with mushrooms minus the slices with both (to avoid double-counting), which can be expressed as: 12 = P + M - B.\n## Step 6:  Substituting the known values for P and M into the equation gives: 12 = 5 + 8 - B.\n## Step 7:  Simplifying the equation by adding the known numbers gives: 12 = 13 - B.\n## Step 8:  To solve for B, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 13 from both sides, which gives: -1 = -B.\n## Step 9:  Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for B gives us: B = 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
