    "problem": "How many 5-digit numbers have at least one 2 or one 3 among their digits?",
    "solution": "A 5-digit number can have for its leftmost digit anything from 1 to 9 inclusive, and for each of its next four digits anything from 0 through 9 inclusive. Thus there are $9\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10=90,\\!000$ 5-digit numbers.\n\nA 5-digit number with no 2 or 3 as a digit can have for its first digit 1 or anything from 4 through 9, and can have for each other digit any of those numbers or 0.\n\nThere are $7 \\times 8\\times 8\\times 8\\times 8=28,\\!672$ such 5-digit numbers. Therefore the number of 5-digit numbers with at least one 2 or one 3 as a digit is  $90,\\!000-28,\\!672=\\boxed{61,328}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what is being asked. We are looking for the number of 5-digit numbers that have at least one 2 or one 3 among their digits.\n## Step 2:  A straightforward way to approach this problem would be to calculate the total number of 5-digit numbers and then subtract the number of 5-digit numbers that do not have any 2 or 3 among their digits.\n## Step 3:  We start by calculating the total number of 5-digit numbers. Since the first digit cannot be 0, there are 9 choices for the first digit and 10 choices for each of the remaining four digits. This gives us a total of $9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 = 90,000$ 5-digit numbers in total.\n## Step 4:  Now, let's find the number of 5-digit numbers that do not have any 2 or 3 among their digits. For the first digit, there are 7 choices (1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) since it cannot be 0, 2, or 3. For each of the remaining four digits, there are 8 choices (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) as they cannot be 2 or 3. This gives us a total of $7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = 32,768$ 5-digit numbers without any 2 or 3 among their digits.\n## Step 5:  Finally, to find the number of 5-digit numbers that have at least one 2 or one 3 among their digits, we subtract the number of 5-digit numbers without any 2 or 3 from the total number of 5-digit numbers. This gives us $90,000 - 32,768 = 57,232$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57232}$"
