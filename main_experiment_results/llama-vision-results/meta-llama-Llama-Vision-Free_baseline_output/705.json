    "problem": "Mr. Cole needs to select 3 girls and 5 boys to go on a backpacking trip. In how many ways can he do this if 6 girls and 11 boys are interested in going on the trip?",
    "solution": "In this problem, Mr. Cole is really selecting two separate groups.  He can choose 3 girls from the 6 girls total in $$ \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20 $$ways, and 5 boys from the 11 boys total in $$ \\binom{11}{5} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 462 $$ways.  Since these two selections are independent (since for each of the 20 ways to pick the girls, there are 462 ways to pick the boys), we multiply them together to get the number of ways that we can form the 8-member trip: $$ \\binom{6}{3}\\binom{11}{5} = (20)(462) = \\boxed{9,\\!240}. $$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to select 3 girls from 6.\nTo select 3 girls out of 6, we use the combination formula, $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $k$ is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, the product of all positive integers up to that number. For the girls, this will be $C(6, 3) = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!}$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the expression for selecting 3 girls.\nWe calculate the factorial of 6, which is $6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720$, and the factorial of 3 is $3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$. Substituting these values into our formula, we get $C(6, 3) = \\frac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to select 5 boys from 11.\nSimilarly, to select 5 boys out of 11, we use the combination formula, $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. For the boys, this will be $C(11, 5) = \\frac{11!}{5!(11-5)!} = \\frac{11!}{5!6!}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression for selecting 5 boys.\nWe calculate the factorial of 11, which is $11! = 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6!$. We already know that $6! = 720$ from Step 2. So, $11! = 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 720$. The factorial of 5 is $5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$. Substituting these values into our formula, we get $C(11, 5) = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 720}{120 \\times 720}$. We can simplify this to $C(11, 5) = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{120}$.\n\n## Step 5: Continue simplifying the expression for selecting 5 boys.\nWe calculate $11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 = 55440$. So, $C(11, 5) = \\frac{55440}{120} = 462$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of ways to select 3 girls and 5 boys.\nThe total number of ways to select 3 girls and 5 boys is the product of the number of ways to select 3 girls and the number of ways to select 5 boys, which is $20 \\times 462$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the product.\nWe multiply 20 and 462 to get the total number of ways to select 3 girls and 5 boys, which is $20 \\times 462 = 9240$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9240}$"
