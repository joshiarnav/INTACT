    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 2 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes?",
    "solution": "Since both the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, we can arrange them with 5 in one and 0 in the other, 4 in one and 1 in the other, or 3 in one and 2 in the other, for a total of $\\boxed{3}$ different arrangements.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem.\nThe problem involves distributing indistinguishable balls into indistinguishable boxes. Since both the balls and the boxes are indistinguishable, the problem can be solved by considering the distribution pattern rather than the specific identity of the balls or the boxes.\n\n## Step 2: Enumerate the possible distributions.\nGiven 5 indistinguishable balls and 2 indistinguishable boxes, we can enumerate the possible distributions based on the number of balls in each box. The distributions can be as follows:\n- 5 balls in one box and 0 in the other.\n- 4 balls in one box and 1 in the other.\n- 3 balls in one box and 2 in the other.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the indistinguishability of the boxes.\nSince the boxes are indistinguishable, each distribution listed in Step 2 counts as one unique way because there is no way to differentiate between the boxes, regardless of which one contains more balls.\n\n## Step 4: Count the unique distributions.\nFrom Step 3, there are 3 unique distributions:\n- (5, 0)\n- (4, 1)\n- (3, 2)\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
