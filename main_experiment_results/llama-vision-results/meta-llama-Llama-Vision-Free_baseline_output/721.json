    "problem": "Bin $A$ has one white ball and four black balls.  Bin $B$ has three balls labeled $\\$1$ and one ball labeled $\\$7$.  Bin $W$ has five balls labeled $\\$8$ and one ball labeled $\\$500$.  A game is played as follows: a ball is randomly selected from bin $A$.  If it is black, then a ball is randomly selected from bin $B$; otherwise, if the original ball is white, then a ball is randomly selected from bin $W$.  You win the amount printed on the second ball selected.  What is your expected win?",
    "solution": "Since Bin $A$ has one white ball and four black balls, the money ball has a $\\dfrac{1}{5}$ chance of coming from Bin $W$ and a $\\dfrac{4}{5}$ chance of coming from Bin $B$.  The total expected value therefore is $E = \\dfrac{1}{5}E_W + \\dfrac{4}{5}E_B$, where $E_W$ and $E_B$ are the expected values of a ball drawn from bins $W$ and $B$, respectively.  Since Bin $W$ has five 8 dollar balls and one 500 dollar ball, its expected value is \\[ E_W = \\frac{5}{6}\\times\\$8 + \\frac{1}{6}\\times\\$500 = \\$90. \\]Since Bin $B$ has three 1 dollar balls and one 7 dollar ball, its expected value is \\[ E_B = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\$1 + \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\$7 = \\$2.5. \\]Therefore \\[ E = \\frac{1}{5}E_W + \\frac{4}{5}E_B = \\frac{1}{5}(\\$90) + \\frac{4}{5}(\\$2.5) = \\boxed{\\$20}. \\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We need to calculate the expected value (or win) for the described game, which involves selecting a ball from bin A, then another ball from either bin B or bin W based on the first selection, and finally winning the amount printed on the second selected ball.\n## Step 2:  Let's start by calculating the probabilities associated with each selection from bin A, which determines the subsequent selection from either bin B or bin W.\n## Step 3:  The probability of selecting a black ball from bin A is $\\frac{4}{5}$, and the probability of selecting a white ball is $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n## Step 4:  Now, we need to calculate the expected value of the game by considering the possible outcomes and their respective probabilities.\n## Step 5:  First, let's consider the scenario when a black ball is selected from bin A. In this case, the expected value from the selection from bin B is $\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot1 + \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot7\\right) = \\frac{4}{5}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{3+7}{4}\\right) = \\frac{4}{5}\\cdot2 = \\frac{8}{5}$.\n## Step 6:  Next, let's consider the scenario when a white ball is selected from bin A. In this case, the expected value from the selection from bin W is $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot8 + \\frac{1}{6}\\cdot500\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{40+500}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}\\cdot\\frac{540}{6} = \\frac{1}{5}\\cdot90 = 18$.\n## Step 7:  To find the overall expected value, we need to combine the results from the two scenarios, taking into account their respective probabilities.\n## Step 8:  The overall expected value is calculated by multiplying the probability of each scenario by its corresponding expected value and summing these products.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the overall expected value is $\\frac{8}{5} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} + 18 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{32}{25} + \\frac{18}{5} = \\frac{32}{25} + \\frac{90}{25} = \\frac{122}{25}$.\n## Step 10:  So, the expected win from playing the game is $\\frac{122}{25}$ dollars.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{122}{25}}$"
