    "problem": "I have an unfair coin that lands as heads with probability of $\\dfrac{2}{3}$. If I flip the coin 5 times, what is the probability that I get exactly two heads?",
    "solution": "We need exactly two flips to come up heads and three to come up tails. The odds that two flips come up heads is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2$ and the odds that the other three all come up tails is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3$. We then need to consider the distinct ways of positioning the heads among the 5 flips: we can put the first one in any of 5 places and the second one in any of the remaining 4 places, but they aren't distinct so we need divide by 2 for a total of $\\dfrac{5\\times4}{2}=10$ ways. Thus the probability is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2\\times\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\times10=\\boxed{\\dfrac{40}{243}}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can view flipping this coin 5 times as being equivalent to the expansion of $(h+t)^5$ where $h=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $t=\\frac{1}{3}$. The value of the $h^nt^{5-n}$ term in this expansion will be the probability of getting exactly $n$ heads, so setting $n=2$ and applying the binomial theorem gives us $p=\\dbinom{5}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3=\\boxed{\\dfrac{40}{243}}$, which is the same answer we got using the other method.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Identify the type of problem\nThis is a binomial probability problem because we have repeated trials (flipping the coin 5 times) with each trial having two outcomes (heads or tails), a fixed probability of success (getting heads) for each trial, and the trials are independent of each other.\n\n## Step 2:  Define the parameters\nThe probability of getting heads on a single flip is $p = \\dfrac{2}{3}$, and the probability of getting tails is $q = 1 - p = \\dfrac{1}{3}$. We flip the coin 5 times, so $n = 5$. We want to find the probability of exactly 2 heads, which means we need 2 successes in 5 trials.\n\n## Step 3:  Use the binomial probability formula\nThe binomial probability formula is given by $P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k q^{n-k}$, where $\\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient, which calculates the number of ways to choose $k$ successes from $n$ trials. In this case, we need to calculate $\\binom{5}{2} \\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^{5-2}$.\n\n## Step 4:  Calculate the binomial coefficient\n$\\binom{5}{2} = \\dfrac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\dfrac{5!}{2!3!} = \\dfrac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\n## Step 5:  Calculate the probability\nNow we can calculate the probability using the formula: $P(X = 2) = 10 \\times \\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = 10 \\times \\dfrac{4}{9} \\times \\dfrac{1}{27} = 10 \\times \\dfrac{4}{243} = \\dfrac{40}{243}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{40}{243}}$"
