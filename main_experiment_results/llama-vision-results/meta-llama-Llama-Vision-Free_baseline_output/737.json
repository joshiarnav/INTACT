    "problem": "How many license plates can be formed if every license plate has 2 different letters (A through Z) followed by 2 different one digit (0-9) numbers?",
    "solution": "The first letter can be any of the 26 letters of the alphabet, while the second letter can be any of the 25 remaining letters. The first digit can be any of the 10 digits, while the second digit can be any of the 9 remaining digits. The number of license plates is $26\\times 25\\times 10\\times 9=\\boxed{58,500}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose the first letter\nThere are 26 letters in the English alphabet, so there are 26 ways to choose the first letter.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose the second letter\nSince the second letter must be different from the first, there are 25 remaining letters to choose from.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose the first digit\nThere are 10 digits in the decimal system, so there are 10 ways to choose the first digit.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose the second digit\nSince the second digit must be different from the first, there are 9 remaining digits to choose from.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the product rule to find the total number of license plates\nThe total number of license plates is the product of the number of ways to choose each part. This is found by multiplying the number of choices for each component together.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of license plates\nTotal number of license plates = (Number of ways to choose the first letter) * (Number of ways to choose the second letter) * (Number of ways to choose the first digit) * (Number of ways to choose the second digit)\nTotal number of license plates = 26 * 25 * 10 * 9\n\n## Step 7: Perform the multiplication\n26 * 25 = 650\n650 * 10 = 6500\n6500 * 9 = 58500\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{58500}$"
