    "problem": "A $4\\times 4\\times 4$ open cubical box contains 64 identical small cubes that exactly fill the box. How many of these small cubes touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box?",
    "solution": "We count the complement. A cube that does not touch the bottom or a lateral side either touches only the top side or no sides at all. These cubes form a $2\\times2\\times3$ prism, giving 12 cubes. These 12 cubes are subtracted from 64 to leave $\\boxed{52}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, we should visualize the $4\\times 4\\times 4$ open cubical box and understand its structure to figure out which small cubes touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box.\n## Step 2:  The box is made up of 64 identical small cubes, arranged in a cubical structure, with each side being composed of 4 cubes.\n## Step 3:  We are asked to find the number of small cubes that touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box.\n## Step 4:  To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps. First, we note that the bottom of the box is a $4 \\times 4$ square grid, and each cube on this grid touches the bottom.\n## Step 5:  Next, we consider the four lateral sides of the box, each of which is also a $4 \\times 4$ square grid. Cubes on the edges between the bottom and the lateral sides, as well as the cubes directly adjacent to these edges, will touch the lateral sides.\n## Step 6:  We can calculate the number of cubes touching the bottom by simply counting the $4 \\times 4$ grid.\n## Step 7:  Then, we can calculate the number of cubes touching the four lateral sides by considering the cubes on the edges between the bottom and the lateral sides, as well as the cubes directly adjacent to these edges.\n## Step 8:  To find the total number of cubes that touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides, we add the number of cubes touching the bottom and the number of cubes touching the lateral sides.\n## Step 9:  We should be careful not to double-count any cubes in this process.\n## Step 10:  Let's proceed with these calculations to find the total number of small cubes that touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box.\n\n## Step 11:  Number of cubes on the bottom: $16$\n## Step 12:  Number of cubes on the edges: $8 \\cdot 4 = 32$\n## Step 13:  Number of cubes that are not on the bottom but touch one of the four sides: $32 - 16 = 16$\n\n## Step 14:  The total number of cubes touching the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box is $16 + 16 = 32$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{32}$"
