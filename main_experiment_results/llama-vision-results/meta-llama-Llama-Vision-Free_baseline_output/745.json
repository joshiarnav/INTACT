    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem involves determining the fraction of unit cubes in a 6-by-6-by-6 cube that has at least two painted faces.\n## Step 2:  First, we need to calculate the total number of unit cubes in the 6-by-6-by-6 cube. Since each edge of the cube is made up of 6 unit cubes, the total number of unit cubes is $6^3 = 216$.\n## Step 3:  Next, we need to find the number of unit cubes with at least two painted faces. We can do this by analyzing the different types of unit cubes based on their location within the larger cube.\n## Step 4:  We note that there are 3 types of unit cubes: those on the edge, those on the corner, and those in the center of the cube.\n## Step 5:  First, let's consider the unit cubes on the edges. Each edge has 6 unit cubes, and there are 12 edges in total. So, there are $6 \\times 12 = 72$ unit cubes on the edges.\n## Step 6:  Now, each of the 8 corner unit cubes has 3 faces painted, and each of the 24 edge unit cubes has 2 faces painted.\n## Step 7:  To find the number of unit cubes with 2 painted faces, we need to subtract the 8 corner unit cubes from the total number of edge unit cubes, giving us $24 - 8 = 16$ unit cubes with 2 painted faces.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the total number of unit cubes with at least 2 faces painted is $8 + 16 = 24$.\n## Step 9:  To find the fraction of the unit cubes with at least two painted faces, we divide the total number of unit cubes with at least two painted faces by the total number of unit cubes.\n## Step 10:  The fraction is then $\\frac{24}{216}$.\n## Step 11:  Simplifying the fraction gives us $\\frac{1}{9}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$"
