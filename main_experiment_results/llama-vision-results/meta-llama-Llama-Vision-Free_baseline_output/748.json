    "problem": "I have 7 books I want to arrange on a shelf. Two of them are math books, and one is a physics book. How many ways are there for me to arrange the books if I want to put the math books next to each other, and put both of them to the left of the physics book? (Note that all the books are distinguishable.)",
    "solution": "We can arrange the books on the shelf, pretending that the two math books are actually one book because they must be next to each other. In exactly half of these arrangements, the math books will be to the left of the physics book, giving $6!/2=360$ arrangements. However, in each of these arrangements there are two ways to arrange the math books, so the total number of arrangements is $360\\cdot2=\\boxed{720}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the total number of books to be arranged\nThere are 7 books in total that need to be arranged on the shelf.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the restriction for the math books\nThe two math books must be arranged next to each other.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the restriction for the physics book\nThe physics book must be placed to the right of both math books.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the math books as a single unit\nSince the two math books must be together, we can think of them as a single unit for the initial arrangement, reducing the total units to be arranged to 6 (the math unit, the physics book, and the remaining 4 books).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to arrange these 6 units\nSince the order of the books matters, the number of ways to arrange 6 distinct units is 6!.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the two math books within the math unit\nSince there are two math books that can be arranged within the single unit, there are 2! ways to arrange them.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total number of ways to arrange the books\nTo find the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange the books within the math unit, which is 6! * 2!.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the value of 6! * 2!\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720, and 2! = 2 * 1 = 2. Multiplying these values, we get 720 * 2 = 1440.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1440}$"
