    "problem": "A bin has 5 white balls and $k$ black balls in it, where $k$ is an unknown positive integer.  A ball is drawn at random from the bin.  If a white ball is drawn, the player wins 1 dollar, but if a black ball is drawn, the player loses 1 dollar.  If the expected $\\textit{loss}$ for playing the game is 50 cents, then what is $k$?",
    "solution": "There are 5 white balls and $5+k$ total balls, so the probability that a white ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{5}{5+k}$.  Similarly, the probability that a black ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{k}{5+k}$.  So  \\[ E = \\frac{5}{5+k}(1) + \\frac{k}{5+k}(-1) = -\\frac{1}{2}. \\] Multiply both sides of the equation by $2(5+k)$ to get $10 - 2k = -5 -k$, and we see that $\\boxed{k = 15}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the value of $k$, the number of black balls in the bin.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the probability of drawing a white ball\nThere are 5 white balls and $k$ black balls, making the total number of balls $5 + k$. The probability of drawing a white ball is the number of white balls divided by the total number of balls, which is $\\frac{5}{5+k}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the probability of drawing a black ball\nThe probability of drawing a black ball is the number of black balls divided by the total number of balls, which is $\\frac{k}{5+k}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the expected loss\nThe expected loss is the sum of the probability of drawing a white ball multiplied by the loss when drawing a white ball (which is $-1$ dollars) and the probability of drawing a black ball multiplied by the loss when drawing a black ball (which is $1$ dollar). Let $E$ be the expected loss, then we have:\n$E = -1 \\cdot \\frac{5}{5+k} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{k}{5+k} = -\\frac{5}{5+k} + \\frac{k}{5+k}$\n\n## Step 5: Solve for E\nSimplifying the expression for $E$, we get:\n$E = \\frac{-5 + k}{5+k}$\n\n## Step 6: Set the expected loss equal to 50 cents (0.5 dollars) and solve for $k$\nWe have that $E = 0.5$, so we can write:\n$\\frac{-5 + k}{5+k} = 0.5$\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $k$\nCross multiplying and solving for $k$, we get:\n$-5 + k = 2.5 + 0.5k$\n$-7.5 = -0.5k$\n$k = 15$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
