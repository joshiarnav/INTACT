    "problem": "A singles tournament had six players. Each player played every other player only once, with no ties. If Helen won 4 games, Ines won 3 games, Janet won 2 games, Kendra won 2 games and Lara won 2 games, how many games did Monica win?",
    "solution": "Each of the six players played 5 games, and each game involved two players. So there were $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ games. Helen, Ines, Janet, Kendra and Lara won a total of $4+3+2+2+2=13$ games, so Monica won $15-13=\\boxed{2}$ games.",

    "file_name": "./MATH/test/counting_and_probability/763.json",
    "model_solution": "Let's break down the information:\n\n* There are 6 players, so there are 6! = 720 possible pairings.\n* Since each player played every other player only once, the total number of games played is 720 / 2 = 360.\n\nSince there are no ties, each game is won by one player. We know that Helen won 4 games, Ines won 3 games, Janet won 2 games, Kendra won 2 games, and Lara won 2 games. This accounts for 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 13 games.\n\nWe know that there are 360 games in total, so Monica must have won 360 - 13 = 347 games.\n\nThe answer is 347."
