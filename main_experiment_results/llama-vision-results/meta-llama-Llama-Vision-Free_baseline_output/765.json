    "problem": "There are 360 people in my school.  15 take calculus, physics, and chemistry, and 15 don't take any of them.  180 take calculus.  Twice as many students take chemistry as take physics.  75 take both calculus and chemistry, and 75 take both physics and chemistry.  Only 30 take both physics and calculus.  How many students take physics?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of students taking physics, so the number in chemistry is $2x$.  There are 15 students taking all three, and 30 students in both physics and calculus, meaning there are $30 - 15 = 15$ students in just physics and calculus.  Similarly there are $60$ students in just chemistry and calculus, and $60$ in physics and chemistry.  Since there are $x$ students in physics and $15 + 15 + 60 = 90$ students taking physics along with other classes, $x - 90$ students are just taking physics.  Similarly, there are $2x - 135$ students taking just chemistry and $90$ students taking just calculus.  Knowing that there are 15 students not taking any of them, the sum of these eight categories is 360, the total number of people at the school:   \\[\n(x - 90) + (2x - 135) + 90 + 60 + 15 + 60 + 15 + 15 = 360.\n\\] We solve for $x$ and find that the number of physics students is $x = \\boxed{110}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the sets and their intersections\nLet's denote the total number of students as S = 360. We'll use C for the set of students taking calculus, P for the set of students taking physics, and Ch for the set of students taking chemistry. The intersections of these sets will be denoted with a dot, e.g., C \u2229 P for the set of students taking both calculus and physics.\n\n## Step 2: Identify given information\nWe know that:\n- |C \u222a P \u222a Ch| = 360 - 15 = 345 (since 15 students don't take any of the three subjects)\n- |C| = 180\n- |C \u2229 Ch| = 75\n- |P \u2229 Ch| = 75\n- |P \u2229 C| = 30\n- 2|P| = |Ch| (twice as many students take chemistry as take physics)\n- |C \u2229 P \u2229 Ch| = 15 (15 take all three subjects)\n\n## Step 3: Use the inclusion-exclusion principle\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets states:\n|C \u222a P \u222a Ch| = |C| + |P| + |Ch| - |C \u2229 P| - |C \u2229 Ch| - |P \u2229 Ch| + |C \u2229 P \u2229 Ch|\nWe can substitute the given values into this formula, keeping in mind that we need to find |P|.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute given values and solve for |P|\n345 = 180 + |P| + |Ch| - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15\nSubtracting known quantities:\n345 = 180 + |P| + |Ch| - 165\nSimplifying:\n345 = |P| + |Ch| + 15\n\n## Step 5: Express |Ch| in terms of |P|\nWe are told that 2|P| = |Ch|.\nSo, |Ch| = 2|P|.\nSubstituting into the equation:\n345 = |P| + 2|P| + 15\n\n## Step 6: Solve for |P|\n345 = 3|P| + 15\nSubtracting 15 from both sides:\n330 = 3|P|\nDividing by 3:\n110 = |P|\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{110}$"
