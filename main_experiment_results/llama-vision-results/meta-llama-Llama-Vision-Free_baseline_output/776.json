    "problem": "The planning committee at school has 11 members. Exactly five of these members are teachers. A four-person subcommittee with at least one member who is not a teacher must be formed from the members of the planning committee. How many distinct subcommittees are possible?",
    "solution": "Because there are 5 teachers on the committee, there are 6 non-teachers. Now, in total, we can form ${11 \\choose 4} = 330$ subcomittees. The number of subcommittees with zero non-teachers is the number of subcommittees formed by the 5 teachers, totaling ${5 \\choose 4} = 5$. So, the number of subcomittees with at least one non-teacher is $330 - 5 = \\boxed{325}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1\nTo find the number of distinct subcommittees, we must first identify all possible combinations of subcommittees that have at least one member who is not a teacher. There are five teachers on the planning committee. This means there are six members who are not teachers.\n\n## Step 2\nTo form a subcommittee with at least one member who is not a teacher, we must exclude the possibility of having only teachers on the subcommittee. We can calculate the number of distinct subcommittees by calculating the number of subcommittees that can be formed from the 11 members, and then subtracting the number of subcommittees that can be formed consisting entirely of teachers.\n\n## Step 3\nTo calculate the total number of subcommittees of 4 members that can be formed from the 11 members, we use the combination formula $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of members and $k$ is the number of members in the subcommittee. Here, $n=11$ and $k=4$, so we have $C(11,4)=\\frac{11!}{4!(11-4)!} = \\frac{11!}{4!7!}$, which simplifies to $330$.\n\n## Step 4\nTo calculate the number of subcommittees that can be formed consisting of only teachers, we use the combination formula. Here, $n=5$ and $k=4$, so we have $C(5,4)=\\frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = \\frac{5!}{4!1!}$, which simplifies to $5$.\n\n## Step 5\nWe can calculate the number of distinct subcommittees of 4 members that can be formed from the 11 members with at least one member who is not a teacher by subtracting the number of subcommittees that can be formed consisting entirely of teachers from the total number of subcommittees. We have $330 - 5$, which equals $325$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{325}$"
