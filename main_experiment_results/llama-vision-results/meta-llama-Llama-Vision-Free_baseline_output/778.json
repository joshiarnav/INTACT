    "solution": "A cube has four red faces if it is attached to exactly two other cubes.  The four top cubes are each attached to only one other cube,  so they have five red faces.  The four bottom corner cubes are each attached to three others, so they have three red faces.  The remaining $\\boxed{6}$ each have four red faces.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are given a figure made up of 14 white cubes, all of which are painted red on their faces.\n## Step 2:  The figure is then separated into individual cubes, and we are tasked with determining the number of individual cubes that have exactly four red faces.\n## Step 3:  To tackle this problem, we need to consider the structure of the figure and how the cubes are connected, including the number of shared faces between adjacent cubes.\n## Step 4:  It's clear that the 8 corner cubes have 4 red faces, while the 6 middle cubes on the edges of the large cube have 3 red faces.\n## Step 5:  Now, we need to identify the cubes with exactly four red faces. These must be the cubes on the very outside of the figure, but not on the corners.\n## Step 6:  There are four such cubes: one on top, one on the bottom, and two on the sides.\n## Step 7:  Each of these cubes has four red faces: the top and bottom, and the two sides.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the number of individual cubes with exactly four red faces is $\\boxed{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
