    "problem": "A bag has 4 red and 6 blue marbles.  A marble is selected and not replaced, then a second is selected.  What is the probability that both are the same color?",
    "solution": "The probability that both marbles are red is given by: $$ P(\\text{both red}) = P(\\text{1st red}) \\times P(\\text{2nd red \\textbf{after} 1st red is drawn}). $$The probability that the first marble is red is $\\frac{4}{10}$.  After drawing a red marble, there are 3 red marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also red is $\\frac{3}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{4}{10}\\times \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{2}{15}. $$Similarly, the probability that both marbles are blue is given by: $$ P(\\text{both blue}) = P(\\text{1st blue}) \\times P(\\text{2nd blue \\textbf{after} 1st blue drawn}). $$The probability that that the first marble is blue is $\\frac{6}{10}$.  After drawing a blue marble, there are 5 blue marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also blue is $\\frac{5}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\\text{both blue}) = \\frac{6}{10}\\times \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}. $$Since drawing two red marbles and drawing two blue marbles are exclusive events, we add the individual probabilities to get the probability of one or the other occurring.  Therefore: \\begin{align*}P(\\text{both same color}) &= P(\\text{both red}) + P(\\text{both blue}) \\\\ &= \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\boxed{ \\frac{7}{15}}. \\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the total number of marbles in the bag initially.\nThere are 4 red and 6 blue marbles, making a total of 10 marbles initially.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing two marbles of the same color, starting with drawing a red marble first.\nThe probability of drawing a red marble first is 4/10, since there are 4 red marbles out of 10 marbles total. After removing one red marble, there are 3 red marbles left out of 9 marbles total, so the probability of drawing a second red marble is 3/9. The probability of drawing two red marbles in sequence is (4/10) * (3/9).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of drawing two marbles of the same color, starting with drawing a blue marble first.\nThe probability of drawing a blue marble first is 6/10, since there are 6 blue marbles out of 10 marbles total. After removing one blue marble, there are 5 blue marbles left out of 9 marbles total, so the probability of drawing a second blue marble is 5/9. The probability of drawing two blue marbles in sequence is (6/10) * (5/9).\n\n## Step 4: Add the probabilities of drawing two red marbles and two blue marbles together to find the total probability of drawing two marbles of the same color.\nWe need to calculate (4/10) * (3/9) + (6/10) * (5/9) to find the total probability.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression (4/10) * (3/9) + (6/10) * (5/9).\nFirst, simplify the fractions: (4/10) simplifies to (2/5) and (6/10) simplifies to (3/5). Then, the expression becomes (2/5) * (3/9) + (3/5) * (5/9). Multiplying the fractions in the first term gives (6/45) and multiplying the fractions in the second term gives (15/45). Adding these terms together results in (6/45) + (15/45) = (21/45).\n\n## Step 6: Further simplify the fraction 21/45 by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor.\nThe greatest common divisor of 21 and 45 is 3. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3 gives (7/15).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{15}}$"
