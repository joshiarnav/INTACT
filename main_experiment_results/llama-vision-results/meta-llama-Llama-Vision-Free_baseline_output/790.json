    "problem": "3 cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that they form a pair?  (A 3-card hand is a 'pair' if two of the cards match in rank but the third card is different.  For example, 668 is a pair, but 999 is not.)",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{52}{3} = 22,\\!100$ ways to choose 3 cards out of 52, without regard to order.  To choose two cards of matching rank, there are 13 different ranks and $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ combinations of suits to choose from, for a total of $13 \\times 6 = 78$ different possibilities.  There are 48 remaining cards not in the same rank as the first two.  This means there are $78 \\times 48 = 3,\\!744$ ways to choose a hand that is a pair.  So the probability that a randomly drawn hand is a pair is $\\dfrac{3744}{22100} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{72}{425}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of 3-card hands that can be chosen from a standard 52-card deck.\nThere are $\\binom{52}{3} = \\frac{52!}{3!(52-3)!} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 22100$ possible 3-card hands.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose a pair.\nThere are 13 ranks of cards in a standard deck, and for each rank, there are 4 cards (one of each suit). To choose a pair, we first choose a rank, which can be done in $\\binom{13}{1} = 13$ ways. Then, from the 4 cards of the chosen rank, we choose 2 cards, which can be done in $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$ ways. After choosing the pair, we have 48 cards remaining in the deck, from which we choose the third card, which can be done in $\\binom{48}{1} = 48$ ways.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of ways to choose a pair.\nThe total number of ways to choose a pair is $13 \\times 6 \\times 48 = 3744$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose a pair with three cards of the same suit.\nThere are 4 suits in a standard deck, and for each suit, there are 13 cards (one of each rank). To choose a pair with three cards of the same suit, we first choose a suit, which can be done in $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$ ways. Then, from the 13 cards of the chosen suit, we choose 3 cards, which can be done in $\\binom{13}{3} = \\frac{13!}{3!(13-3)!} = \\frac{13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 286$ ways.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of ways to choose a pair with three cards of the same suit.\nThe total number of ways to choose a pair with three cards of the same suit is $4 \\times 286 = 1144$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to choose a pair with three cards of different suits.\nWe subtract the number of ways to choose a pair with three cards of the same suit from the total number of ways to choose a pair. Therefore, the number of ways to choose a pair with three cards of different suits is $3744 - 1144 = 2600$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability of choosing a pair.\nThe probability of choosing a pair is the total number of ways to choose a pair divided by the total number of possible 3-card hands. Therefore, the probability of choosing a pair is $\\frac{2600}{22100} = \\frac{130}{1105}$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the fraction if possible.\nThe fraction $\\frac{130}{1105}$ can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5. Therefore, $\\frac{130}{1105} = \\frac{26}{221}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{26}{221}}$"
