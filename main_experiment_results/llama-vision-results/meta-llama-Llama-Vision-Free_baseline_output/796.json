    "problem": "In how many ways can we seat 8 people around a table if Alice and Bob won't sit next to each other?  (Two seatings are the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "There are 8 choices for seats for Alice to sit in.  Once Alice is seated, there are 5 seats left for Bob, since he won't sit in either seat immediately next to Alice.  This leaves 6 people to place in the remaining 6 seats, which can be done in $6!$ ways.  However, we must divide by 8 to account for the 8 rotations of the table.  So the number of arrangements is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 5 \\times 6!}{8} = 5 \\times 6! = \\boxed{3600}$. Alternatively, we can account for the rotations at the beginning, by fixing the table around Alice.  Bob can't sit in her seat, or the two seats next to her.  This leaves 5 places for him to sit.  Then, this leaves 6 unique seats for the 6 remaining people, so there are 6! ways to sit them after Bob is sitting.  So the answer is $5 \\times 6! = \\boxed{3600}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and what's being asked\nWe are tasked with finding the number of ways to seat 8 people around a table, with the restriction that Alice and Bob cannot sit next to each other. The seating arrangements are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of ways to seat 8 people around the table without restrictions\nTo start, let's consider the total number of ways to seat the 8 people around the table without any restrictions. Since the people are distinct, the number of ways to arrange them is (8-1)!, which is 7!\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of ways to seat 8 people around the table where Alice and Bob are seated next to each other\nNow, we need to find the number of seating arrangements where Alice and Bob are seated next to each other. We can consider Alice and Bob as a single entity, and then calculate the number of ways to arrange 7 entities around the table. This is equal to (7-1)!, which is 6!. However, within this entity, Alice and Bob can be arranged in 2 different ways (Alice to the left of Bob or Bob to the left of Alice), so we multiply the number of arrangements by 2. Therefore, the total number of arrangements where Alice and Bob are seated next to each other is 2 * 6!.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final number of seating arrangements where Alice and Bob are not seated next to each other\nTo find the number of seating arrangements where Alice and Bob are not seated next to each other, we subtract the number of arrangements where they are seated next to each other from the total number of arrangements. This gives us: 7! - 2 * 6!.\n\n## Step 5: Compute the values\n7! = 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5040\n6! = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720\n2 * 6! = 1440\nSo, 7! - 2 * 6! = 5040 - 1440 = 3600\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3600}$"
