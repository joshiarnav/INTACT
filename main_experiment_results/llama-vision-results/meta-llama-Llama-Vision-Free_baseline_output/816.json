    "problem": "When counting from $3$ to $201$, $53$ is the $51^\\mathrm{st}$ number counted. When counting backwards from $201$ to $3$, $53$ is the $n^\\mathrm{th}$ number counted. What is $n$?",
    "solution": "Note that $n$ is equal to the number of integers between $53$ and $201$, inclusive. Thus, $n=201-53+1=\\boxed{149}$.",
