    "problem": "Four-digit integers are formed using the digits 2, 3, 4 and 5. Any of the digits can be used any number of times. How many such four-digit integers are palindromes? Palindromes read the same forward and backward.",
    "solution": "If the four-digit integer is to be a palindrome, then the third digit must be the same as the second and the fourth must be the same as the first.  So, once we choose the first two digits, we can only form the palindrome in one way. There are 4 choices for the first digit and 4 choices for the second digit, so there are $4 \\times 4 = \\boxed{16}$ such integers.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the conditions for a four-digit integer to be a palindrome.\nTo form a palindrome, the first and last digits must be the same, and the second and third digits must also be the same. This means we have two distinct pairs of digits that must be identical in a palindrome.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the choices for the first and last digits.\nWe have four choices for the first and last digits: 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since any digit can be repeated, the first digit can match any of the four options, and the last digit must match it.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the choices for the second and third digits.\nAfter choosing the first and last digits, we are left with three choices for the second and third digits, since we can choose any of the remaining digits, including repeating the choice made for the first and last digits.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of palindromes.\nTo find the total number of palindromes, we multiply the number of choices for the first and last digit by the number of choices for the second and third digit.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of palindromes.\nThe number of choices for the first and last digit is 4. The number of choices for the second and third digit is 3. Thus, the total number of palindromes is 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
