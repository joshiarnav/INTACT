    "solution": "There are $3$ points we can get to from $A$.  Each of these connects to two points adjacent to $B$ and to $A$.  We can't go back to $A$ and then get to $B$ in one step, but we can choose either of the other two points.  So there are $3(2)=\\boxed{6}$ paths from $A$ to $B$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the cube and how many different paths can be taken from vertex $A$ to vertex $B$.\n## Step 2:  Since the question asks for three-step paths along the edges of the cube, we can visualize the movement from $A$ to $B$ in terms of the number of steps in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions.\n## Step 3:  In order to reach $B$ from $A$, we need to take one step in the positive $x$ direction, one step in the positive $y$ direction, and one step in the negative $z$ direction.\n## Step 4:  The steps can be ordered in $3! = 6$ ways, such as $x$ then $y$ then $z$, or $x$ then $z$ then $y$, and so on.\n## Step 5:  This means that there are 6 different paths that we can take while moving from $A$ to $B$, considering the possible orderings of steps in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions.\n## Step 6:  Hence, the total number of different three-step paths along the edges of a cube that take us from vertex $A$ to vertex $B$ is $\\boxed{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
