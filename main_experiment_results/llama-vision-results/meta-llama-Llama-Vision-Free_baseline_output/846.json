    "solution": "We can make a triangle out of any three vertices, so the problem is really asking how many ways there are to choose three vertices from six. There are six choices for the first vertex, five for the second, and four for the third. However, we've overcounted, so we have to determine how many different orders there are in which we could choose those same three vertices. That is, if we choose $x$ for the first vertex, $y$ for the second, and $z$ for the third, it will be the same triangle as if we had chosen $y$ for the first vertex, $z$ for the second, and $x$ for the third. We can pick any three of the vertices first, any two second, and then the last is determined, so we've overcounted by a factor of six. Thus, our final answer is $\\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4}{6} = \\boxed{20}$ triangles.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of ways we can choose three vertices from a hexagon to form a triangle.\n## Step 2:  The order in which we choose the vertices does not matter, as the same triangle will be formed regardless of the order.\n## Step 3:  We can approach this problem by using combinations, denoted as $\\binom{n}{r}$, which represents the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n distinct items without considering the order.\n## Step 4:  In this case, we have a hexagon with 6 vertices, and we want to choose 3 of them to form a triangle.\n## Step 5:  The number of ways to choose 3 vertices from 6 can be calculated using the combination formula: $\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20$.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, there are 20 different triangles that can be formed using three vertices of a hexagon as vertices of a triangle.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$"
