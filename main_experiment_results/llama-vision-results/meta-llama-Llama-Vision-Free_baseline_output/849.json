    "problem": "How many ways are there to arrange $6$ beads of distinct colors in a $2 \\times 3$ grid if reflections and rotations are considered the same? (In other words, two arrangements are considered the same if I can rotate and/or reflect one arrangement to get the other.)",
    "solution": "There are $6! = 720$ ways to put the beads on the grid ignoring distinguishability. On the other hand, there are $4$ possible transformations of the board using rotations and reflections (including the identity):\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}\nA & B & C & & C & B & A\\\\\nD & E & F & & F & E & D\n\\end{tabular}\\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}\nF & E & D & & D & E & F\\\\\nC & B & A & & A & B & C\n\\end{tabular}None of these transformations besides the identity fixes an arrangement, so each arrangement is equivalent to three others. As a result, there are $\\tfrac{720}{4} = \\boxed{180}$ different arrangements.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of arrangements without considering rotations and reflections\nTo find the total number of arrangements without considering rotations and reflections, we can use the concept of permutations. Since we have 6 distinct beads to place in a 2x3 grid, we can arrange them in 6! ways.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of arrangements considering rotations\nSince the grid is a 2x3 grid, it has 4-fold rotational symmetry. This means that if we rotate an arrangement by 90, 180, 270 degrees, or 360 degrees, it will be considered the same. So, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by 4 to account for rotations.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of arrangements considering reflections\nIn addition to rotations, we also need to consider reflections. A reflection of an arrangement will be considered the same. There are two types of reflections: horizontal and vertical. We need to divide the number of arrangements by 2 to account for horizontal reflections and again by 2 to account for vertical reflections.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final number of arrangements considering both rotations and reflections\nTo get the final number of distinct arrangements, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by 4 (for rotations) and by 2 (for horizontal reflection) and by 2 (for vertical reflection).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of distinct arrangements\nThe total number of distinct arrangements is given by 6! / (4*2*2).\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression\n6! / (4*2*2) = (6*5*4*3*2*1) / (4*2*2) = 720 / 16 = 45\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{45}$"
