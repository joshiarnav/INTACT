    "problem": "During a party, a total of 78 handshakes occurred. If each person shook hands once with each of the other people, how many people were at the party?",
    "solution": "Since each person shakes hands with each other person, every pair of people will shake hands once. So, 78 represents the number of pairs, which we can count as ${n \\choose 2}$ where $n$ is the number of people at the party. So, $n(n-1) = 2 \\cdot 78 = 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 13 = 12 \\cdot 13$. So, $n=13$ gives us $\\boxed{13}$ people at the party.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the total number of people at the party, we can approach this problem by using the concept of combinations. Since each handshake involves two people, we can treat each handshake as an unordered pair of people.\n## Step 2:  We are given that a total of 78 handshakes occurred, and we want to find the number of people at the party.\n## Step 3:  We can represent this situation using the combination formula $\\binom{n}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of people at the party. The number of handshakes is equal to $\\binom{n}{2}$, which represents the number of ways to choose 2 people out of $n$ to form a handshake.\n## Step 4:  Substituting the given value of handshakes, we have the equation $\\binom{n}{2} = 78$. This equation represents the total number of handshakes in terms of the number of people at the party.\n## Step 5:  To solve for $n$, we can use the combination formula: $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. Substituting this into our equation, we get $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 78$.\n## Step 6:  Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction, we get the quadratic equation $n(n-1) = 156$.\n## Step 7:  We can rewrite this equation as $n^2 - n - 156 = 0$ to set up for factoring or using the quadratic formula.\n## Step 8:  Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(n - 13)(n + 12) = 0$.\n## Step 9:  Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible solutions: $n - 13 = 0$ and $n + 12 = 0$, which yield $n = 13$ and $n = -12$.\n## Step 10:  Since the number of people at the party cannot be negative, we discard the solution $n = -12$ and conclude that there were $\\boxed{13}$ people at the party.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$"
