    "problem": "I have 18 distinguishable socks in my drawer: 8 white, 6 brown, and 4 blue.  In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of the same color?",
    "solution": "The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue.  If the socks are white, there are $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ choices.  If the socks are brown, there are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ choices.  If the socks are blue, there is $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  So the total number of choices for socks is $28 + 15 + 6 = \\boxed{49}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color from the given 18 distinguishable socks.\n## Step 2:  First, we can choose a pair of white socks from the 8 white socks available. This can be calculated using combinations, denoted as $\\dbinom{n}{r}$, which represents the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n distinct items without considering the order. Therefore, we have $\\dbinom{8}{2}$ ways to choose a pair of white socks.\n## Step 3:  Similarly, we can choose a pair of brown socks from the 6 brown socks available, giving us $\\dbinom{6}{2}$ ways to do so.\n## Step 4:  Finally, we can choose a pair of blue socks from the 4 blue socks available, which can be done in $\\dbinom{4}{2}$ ways.\n## Step 5:  To find the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color, we need to add the number of ways to choose each color together.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color is $\\dbinom{8}{2} + \\dbinom{6}{2} + \\dbinom{4}{2}$.\n## Step 7:  By evaluating these combinations, we get $\\dbinom{8}{2} = 28$, $\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15$, and $\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6$.\n## Step 8:  Adding these values together, we get $28 + 15 + 6 = 49$.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, there are 49 ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{49}$"
