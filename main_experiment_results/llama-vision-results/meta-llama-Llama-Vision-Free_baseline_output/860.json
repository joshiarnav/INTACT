    "problem": "John rolls a pair of standard 6-sided dice. What is the probability that the two numbers he rolls are relatively prime? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We have to use a little bit of casework to solve this problem. If the first die shows a 1, the second die can be anything (6 cases). If the first die shows 2 or 4, the second die is limited to 1, 3, or 5 ($2\\cdot3 = 6$ cases). If the first die shows 3, the second die can be 1, 2, 4, or 5 (4 cases). If the first die shows 5, the second die can be anything but 5 (5 cases). If the first die shows 6, the second die can be only 1 or 5 (2 cases). There are 36 ways to roll two dice, 23 of which are valid, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{23}{36}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify what it means for two numbers to be relatively prime\nTwo numbers are relatively prime if they have no common factors other than 1. This means that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers is 1.\n\n## Step 2: List all the possible outcomes when rolling a pair of 6-sided dice\nThere are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two 6-sided dice. Each die has 6 possible outcomes, so the total number of outcomes is 6 x 6 = 36.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the pairs of numbers that are relatively prime\nThe pairs of numbers that are relatively prime are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,3), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,5).\n\n## Step 4: Count the number of pairs that are relatively prime\nThere are 18 pairs that are relatively prime.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that the two numbers rolled are relatively prime\nThe probability is equal to the number of favorable outcomes (pairs that are relatively prime) divided by the total number of outcomes. probability = 18 / 36 = 1/2\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the fraction if necessary\nThe fraction 1/2 cannot be simplified further.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$"
