    "problem": "3 cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that they can be arranged into a group of three consecutive cards, all of the same suit? For this problem, an Ace can either come before a 2 or after a King, but not both (so A23 and QKA both count, but KA2 doesn't).",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{52}{3} = 22,\\!100$ ways to choose 3 cards out of 52, without regard to order. For any suit, there are 12 possible triples of consecutive cards (since the three consecutive cards can start on an A, 2, 3, ..., or Q, but not on a K). Since there are 4 suits, there are $4\\cdot12=48$ valid triples. The chance that three cards chosen randomly are three consecutive cards of the same suit is therefore $\\frac{48}{22,\\!100}=\\boxed{\\frac{12}{5,\\!525}}$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Determine the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from a 52-card deck.\nThere are $\\binom{52}{3}$ ways to choose 3 cards from a 52-card deck.\n\n## Step 2:  Identify the different suits that the consecutive cards can have.\nThe consecutive cards can have any of the four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, or spades.\n\n## Step 3:  Calculate the number of ways to choose the suit of the consecutive cards.\nThere are 4 ways to choose the suit of the consecutive cards.\n\n## Step 4:  Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 consecutive cards of the same suit.\nFor each suit, there are 13 ways to choose 3 consecutive cards. This can be done by choosing any of the 13 cards in the suit and then selecting the next two cards in sequence.\n\n## Step 5:  Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 consecutive cards of the same suit.\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 consecutive cards of the same suit is $13 \\times 4 = 52$.\n\n## Step 6:  Account for the permutations of the 3 consecutive cards.\nEach set of 3 consecutive cards can be arranged in 3! = 6 different ways. However, we need to divide by 2 because for each set of 3 consecutive cards, there are two valid arrangements: one where the cards are in ascending order and one where they are in descending order.\n\n## Step 7:  Calculate the total number of valid arrangements of 3 consecutive cards of the same suit.\nThe total number of valid arrangements is $52 \\div 2 = 26$.\n\n## Step 8:  Determine the total number of valid outcomes.\nThe total number of valid outcomes is the product of the total number of suits and the total number of valid arrangements, which is $4 \\times 26 = 104$.\n\n## Step 9:  Calculate the probability of choosing 3 consecutive cards of the same suit.\nThe probability of choosing 3 consecutive cards of the same suit is $\\frac{104}{\\binom{52}{3}}$.\n\n## Step 10:  Simplify the probability fraction.\n$\\frac{104}{\\binom{52}{3}} = \\frac{104}{22,100} = \\frac{52}{11,050} = \\frac{26}{5,525}$.\n\n## Step 11:  Compute the probability.\n$\\frac{26}{5,525}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{26}{5525}}$"
