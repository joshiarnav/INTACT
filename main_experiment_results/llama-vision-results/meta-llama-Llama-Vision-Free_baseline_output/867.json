    "problem": "Derek's phone number, $336$ - $7624,$ has the property that the three-digit prefix, $336,$ equals the product of the last four digits, $7 \\times 6 \\times 2 \\times 4.$ How many seven-digit phone numbers beginning with $336$ have this property?",
    "solution": "We begin by factoring $336$. $336 = 2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7.$ Because we are looking for phone numbers, we want four single digits that will multiply to equal $336.$ Notice that $7$ cannot be multiplied by anything, because $7 \\cdot 2$ is $14,$ which is already two digits. So, one of our digits is necessarily $7.$  The factor $3$ can be multiplied by at most $2,$ and the highest power of $2$ that we can have is $2^3 = 8.$ Using these observations, it is fairly simple to come up with the following list of groups of digits whose product is $336:$ \\begin{align*}\n&1, 6, 7, 8\\\\\n&2, 4, 6, 7\\\\\n&2, 3, 7, 8 \\\\\n&3, 4, 4, 7\n\\end{align*}For the first three groups, there are $4! = 24$ possible rearrangements of the digits. For the last group, $4$ is repeated twice, so we must divide by $2$ to avoid overcounting, so there are $\\frac{4!}{2} = 12$ possible rearrangements of the digits. Thus, there are $3 \\cdot 24 + 12 = \\boxed{84}$ possible phone numbers that can be constructed to have this property.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem is asking us to find the number of seven-digit phone numbers that begin with the prefix $336$ and have the property that the first three digits equal the product of the last four digits.\n## Step 2:  To approach this, we first need to determine the possible values for the last four digits that satisfy the given condition.\n## Step 3:  The product of the last four digits is $7 \\times 6 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 336.$ We are looking for seven-digit numbers that have $336$ as the first three digits, so the last four digits must be a product of $336$.\n## Step 4:  We need to list out the factors of $336$, which are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 21, 24, 28, 42, 56, 84,$ and $336.$\n## Step 5:  We can ignore the factor $1$ as it would result in a six-digit number, which doesn't satisfy the given condition.\n## Step 6:  Additionally, we can ignore the factors $2, 3, 4, 6,$ and $7$ since they are already part of the first three digits, $336$.\n## Step 7:  So, we are left with the remaining factors: $8, 12, 14, 21, 24, 28, 42, 56, 84,$ and $336$.\n## Step 8:  Next, we need to consider the placement of these factors. The first digit of the last four digits can be anything from $1$ to $8.$\n## Step 9:  From these options, only $8$ is available to use, as the other options will make the product exceed $9$ (the maximum digit in a phone number).\n## Step 10:  We can then calculate the number of options for the remaining three digits.\n## Step 11:  We find that there are $8 \\times 7 \\times 6 = 336$ possible combinations for the last three digits if we start with $8$.\n## Step 12:  However, we need to consider the case where we start with a factor other than $8.$\n## Step 13:  We can calculate the number of options for the remaining three digits for each factor.\n## Step 14:  The possible combinations for factors other than $8$ are $9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 21, 28, 35, 42, 56, 84,$ and $112.$\n## Step 15:  After calculating, we find that for each of these factors, we have $7 \\times 6 \\times 5 = 210$ possible combinations for the last three digits.\n## Step 16:  Since there are $4$ factors other than $8,$ we multiply $210$ by $4$ to get the total possible combinations for the last three digits when starting with a factor other than $8.$\n## Step 17:  This results in a total of $4 \\times 210 = 840$ possible combinations for the last three digits when starting with a factor other than $8.$\n## Step 18:  To find the total number of seven-digit phone numbers beginning with $336$ that have this property, we add the number of combinations starting with $8$ to the number of combinations starting with factors other than $8.$\n## Step 19:  This gives us $336 + 840 = \\boxed{1176}$ possible seven-digit phone numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1176}$"
