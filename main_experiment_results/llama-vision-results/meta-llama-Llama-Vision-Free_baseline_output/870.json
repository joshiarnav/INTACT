    "problem": "Four points, $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle. What is the probability that segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect?",
    "solution": "Consider the four random points before they are labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$. In the general case, they will be distinct, forming a convex quadrilateral. Suppose $A$ is labeled. If $B$ is labeled as the vertex opposite $A$, segments $AB$ and $CD$ will intersect; otherwise, they will not. Since there are 3 points to label as $B$, the probability these segments intersect is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, we need to understand the problem and what it's asking for. We have four points, $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, and we need to find the probability that segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect.\n\n## Step 2:  To approach this, we can consider the total number of ways the four points can be arranged on the circle's circumference and then determine how many of these arrangements result in an intersection of segments $AB$ and $CD$.\n\n## Step 3:  We can begin by ordering the four points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ clockwise around the circle as $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. This creates a sequence of the points, which will help us identify the cases where the segments intersect.\n\n## Step 4:  We observe that the intersection of segments $AB$ and $CD$ occurs when the points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are ordered as $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ or as $A$, $B$, $D$, $C$.\n\n## Step 5:  To calculate the probability of the segments intersecting, we need to find the total number of ways the points can be arranged on the circle and then count the number of arrangements that lead to an intersection.\n\n## Step 6:  Since there are $4! = 24$ ways to order the four points on the circle's circumference, we can calculate the probability of the segments intersecting by determining the favorable outcomes and dividing it by the total possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 7:  Considering the cases where the intersection occurs, we find that there are $8$ different orderings that satisfy the intersection condition, out of the $24$ total possible orderings.\n\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the probability of the segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersecting is $\\frac{8}{24} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n## Step 9:  Hence, we can confidently conclude that the probability of segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersecting is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$"
