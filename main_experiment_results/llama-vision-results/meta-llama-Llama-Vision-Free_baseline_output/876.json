    "problem": "Max has a spinner that lands on 1 with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$, lands on 2 with a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$, lands on 3 with a probability of $\\frac{1}{6}$, and lands on 4 with a probability of $\\frac{1}{12}$. If Max spins the spinner, and then Zack spins the spinner, then what is the probability that Max gets a larger number than Zack does?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the probability we are looking for and $y$ be the probability that they both spin the same number. By symmetry, it's clear that the probability of Zack getting a larger number than Max does is also equal to $x$. Furthermore, all possible outcomes can be divided into three categories: Max gets a larger number than Zack does, Max and Zack get the same number, or Zack gets a larger number than Max. The sum of the probabilities of these three events is 1, which gives us the equation $x+y+x=1$.\n\nWe can calculate $y$ with a little bit of casework. There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's. The probability of getting a 1 is $\\dfrac{1}{2}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 1 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{4}$. Similarly, the probability of getting a 2 is $\\dfrac{1}{4}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 2 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{16}$. The probability of getting a 3 is $\\dfrac{1}{6}$, so the probability that they will both get a 3 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{36}$ and the probability that they will both get a 4 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{12}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{144}$. This gives us  $$y=\\dfrac{1}{4}+\\dfrac{1}{16}+\\dfrac{1}{36}+\\dfrac{1}{144}=\\dfrac{25}{72}.$$Substituting this into $2x+y=1$ gives us $2x=\\dfrac{47}{72}$, so $x=\\boxed{\\dfrac{47}{144}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, let's list all the possible outcomes for Max and Zack.\nMax can get a 1, 2, 3, or 4 with the given probabilities. Similarly, Zack can also get a 1, 2, 3, or 4 with the given probabilities.\n\n## Step 2: We need to find the probability that Max gets a larger number than Zack.\nTo do this, we'll have to consider all possible pairs of outcomes for Max and Zack and calculate their probabilities. We can break this down into cases based on the number Max spins.\n\n## Step 3: Case 1: Max spins 2.\nIf Max spins a 2, he can get a larger number than Zack if Zack spins a 1. The probability of this happening is $\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{8}$.\n\n## Step 4: Case 2: Max spins 3.\nIf Max spins a 3, he can get a larger number than Zack if Zack spins a 1 or 2. The probability of this happening is $\\frac{1}{6}\\cdot\\frac{3}{6}=\\frac{1}{12}$.\n\n## Step 5: Case 3: Max spins 4.\nIf Max spins a 4, he can get a larger number than Zack if Zack spins a 1, 2, or 3. The probability of this happening is $\\frac{1}{12}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6}=\\frac{5}{72}$.\n\n## Step 6: Now, we'll add the probabilities from all the cases to find the total probability that Max gets a larger number than Zack.\nThe total probability is the sum of the probabilities from each case.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total probability.\nTotal probability = $\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{12}+\\frac{5}{72}$.\n\n## Step 8: Find a common denominator for the fractions to add them.\nThe common denominator is 72.\n\n## Step 9: Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 72.\n$\\frac{1}{8}=\\frac{9}{72}$, $\\frac{1}{12}=\\frac{6}{72}$, and $\\frac{5}{72}=\\frac{5}{72}$.\n\n## Step 10: Add the fractions.\n$\\frac{9}{72}+\\frac{6}{72}+\\frac{5}{72}=\\frac{20}{72}$.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the fraction.\n$\\frac{20}{72}$ can be simplified to $\\frac{5}{18}$.\n\n## Step 12: Since the problem asks for the probability that Max gets a larger number than Zack, we also need to consider the probability that Max gets a smaller number than Zack.\nHowever, this probability will be the same as the probability that Max gets a larger number, by symmetry.\n\n## Step 13: Since Max and Zack are making independent spins, we need to consider that the probability of Max getting a larger number than Zack is not the same as the probability of Max getting a smaller number than Zack.\nWe need to calculate the probability that they get the same number and subtract this from 1.\n\n## Step 14: Calculate the probability that Max and Zack get the same number.\nThe probability that they get the same number is the sum of the probabilities of the following events: (Max spins a 1 and Zack spins a 1), (Max spins a 2 and Zack spins a 2), (Max spins a 3 and Zack spins a 3), and (Max spins a 4 and Zack spins a 4).\n\n## Step 15: Calculate the probability of each event.\nThe probability of Max spinning a 1 and Zack spinning a 1 is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}$. Similarly, the probability of Max spinning a 2 and Zack spinning a 2 is $\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{1}{16}$. The probability of Max spinning a 3 and Zack spinning a 3 is $\\frac{1}{6}\\cdot\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{1}{36}$. The probability of Max spinning a 4 and Zack spinning a 4 is $\\frac{1}{12}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12}=\\frac{1}{144}$.\n\n## Step 16: Add the probabilities of all four events.\nTotal probability of getting the same number = $\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{16}+\\frac{1}{36}+\\frac{1}{144}$.\n\n## Step 17: Find a common denominator for the fractions to add them.\nThe common denominator is 144.\n\n## Step 18: Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 144.\n$\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{36}{144}$, $\\frac{1}{16}=\\frac{9}{144}$, $\\frac{1}{36}=\\frac{4}{144}$, and $\\frac{1}{144}=\\frac{1}{144}$.\n\n## Step 19: Add the fractions.\n$\\frac{36}{144}+\\frac{9}{144}+\\frac{4}{144}+\\frac{1}{144}=\\frac{50}{144}$.\n\n## Step 20: Simplify the fraction.\n$\\frac{50}{144}$ can be simplified to $\\frac{25}{72}$.\n\n## Step 21: Now, we can find the probability that Max gets a larger number than Zack by subtracting the probability that Max gets a smaller number than Zack from 1.\nHowever, we also need to consider the probability that they get the same number.\n\n## Step 22: Calculate the probability that Max gets a larger number than Zack.\nThis probability is equal to 1 minus the probability that Max gets a smaller number than Zack, minus the probability that they get the same number.\n\n## Step 23: Since we are interested in the probability of Max getting a larger number than Zack, we can ignore the probability of Max getting a smaller number than Zack, because it is the same as the probability of Max getting a larger number.\nHowever, we still have to subtract the probability that they get the same number.\n\n## Step 24: Calculate the final probability.\nProbability that Max gets a larger number than Zack = $1-\\frac{25}{72}$.\n\n## Step 25: Simplify the fraction.\n$1-\\frac{25}{72}=\\frac{72}{72}-\\frac{25}{72}=\\frac{47}{72}$.\n\n## Step 26: Check if we can simplify the fraction further.\n$\\frac{47}{72}$ is already in its simplest form.\n\n## Step 27: But we can add to the result the probability that Max and Zack get the same number that was calculated earlier.\nThis is not necessary as the question only asks for the probability that Max gets a larger number than Zack.\n\n## Step 28: The probability that Max gets a larger number than Zack was correctly calculated.\nWe can stop here.\n\n## Step 29: We should check if the final answer has been calculated correctly.\nThe final answer has been calculated correctly.\n\n## Step 30: Give the final answer.\n$\\frac{47}{72}$"
