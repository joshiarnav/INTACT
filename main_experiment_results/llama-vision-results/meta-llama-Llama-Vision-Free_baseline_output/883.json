    "problem": "Suelyn counts up from 1 to 9, and then immediately counts down again to 1, and then back up to 9, and so on, alternately counting up and down $$(1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,\\ldots ).$$ What is the $1000^{\\text{th}}$ integer in her list?",
    "solution": "We can treat this list as a sequence with a repetitive pattern. We see the sequence repeats itself every 16 elements (from 1 to 9 then back to 2). Because 1000 divided by 16 is 62 with a remainder of 8, to get 1000 terms in this list, we repeat the block 62 times, and then go 8 more elements.  This means that the $1000^{\\text{th}}$ integer is the same as the $8^{\\text{th}}$ integer, which is $\\boxed{8}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Let's analyze the pattern of Suelyn's counting.\nSuelyn starts counting from 1 and goes up to 9, then immediately counts down to 1, and then back up to 9 again. This creates an alternating pattern of increasing and decreasing by 1 each time.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of integers in each cycle.\nEach cycle consists of 18 integers: 9 integers going up and 9 integers going down.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of complete cycles before the 1000th integer.\nDivide 1000 by 18 to determine the number of complete cycles before reaching the 1000th integer. $1000/18 = 55$ with a remainder of 10.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the position of the 1000th integer within the 55th cycle.\nSince 55 complete cycles contain 55 x 18 = 990 integers, the 1000th integer is the 10th integer in the 55th cycle.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the direction of the 55th cycle.\nSince the pattern alternates between increasing and decreasing, and the 55th cycle is an odd cycle, it will be an increasing cycle.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the 10th integer in the 55th cycle.\nSince the 55th cycle consists of 9 integers going up, the 10th integer will be the same as the 10th integer in the pattern. Since the pattern starts with 1 and goes up to 9, we need to find the 10th integer in the sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, ...). To find this integer, we can find the remainder of 10 divided by 18, which is 4.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the 1000th integer.\nThe remainder 4 indicates the position of the 1000th integer in the pattern. Since the pattern starts with 1 and goes up to 9, the 4th integer in the sequence is 4.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
