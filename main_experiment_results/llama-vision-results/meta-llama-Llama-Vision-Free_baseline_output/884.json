    "problem": "A group of 10 Caltech students go to Lake Street for lunch. Each student eats at either Chipotle or Panda Express.  In how many different ways can the students collectively go to lunch?",
    "solution": "For each person, there are 2 choices: eat at Chipotle, or eat at Panda Express. To get the total number of outcomes, we multiply the number of possibilities for each person; $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 2 = 2^{10}=\\boxed{1024}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the choices available to each student\nEach student has two options for lunch: Chipotle or Panda Express.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of choices for 10 students\nSince each student has 2 options and there are 10 students, the total number of different ways the students can collectively go to lunch can be found by raising 2 to the power of 10.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of ways\n2^10 = 1024\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1024}$"
