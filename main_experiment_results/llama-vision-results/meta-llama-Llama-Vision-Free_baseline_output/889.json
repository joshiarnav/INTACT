    "solution": "There are $7!$ ways to put the beads on the grid, not considering rotations and reflections. Arrangements can be reflected or not reflected and can be rotated by 0, 60, 120, 180, 240, or 300 degrees, so they come in groups of twelve equivalent arrangements. Correcting for the symmetries, we find that there are $7!/12=\\boxed{420}$ distinct arrangements.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the constraints\nThe problem requires us to find the number of distinct arrangements of seven beads of different colors on a hexagonal grid, considering rotations and reflections as equivalent arrangements.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the symmetries of the hexagon\nThe hexagon has 6-fold rotational symmetry and reflectional symmetry. This means that if we rotate the hexagon by 60 degrees, or reflect it across any line of symmetry, the arrangement is considered equivalent.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of arrangements without considering symmetries\nThere are 7 beads, and each bead can be placed in any of the 6 positions on the hexagon. Therefore, without considering symmetries, there are $6^7$ possible arrangements.\n\n## Step 4: Account for rotational symmetries\nSince the hexagon has 6-fold rotational symmetry, each arrangement is counted 6 times. Therefore, we divide the total number of arrangements by 6 to account for rotational symmetries.\n\n## Step 5: Account for reflectional symmetries\nIn addition to rotational symmetries, the hexagon also has reflectional symmetries. Each arrangement is counted twice due to reflectional symmetries. Therefore, we divide the result from step 4 by 2 to account for reflectional symmetries.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final number of distinct arrangements\nThe final number of distinct arrangements is obtained by dividing the total number of arrangements by 6 and then by 2. This gives us $\\dfrac{6^7}{12} = 6^5$.\n\n## Step 7: Compute the final answer\n$6^5 = 7776$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7776}$"
