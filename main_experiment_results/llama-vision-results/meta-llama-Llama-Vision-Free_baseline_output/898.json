    "problem": "A bag contains two red beads and two green beads. You reach into the bag and pull out a bead, replacing it with a red bead regardless of the color you pulled out.  What is the probability that all beads in the bag are red after three such replacements? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The beads will all be red at the end of the third draw precisely when two  green beads are chosen in the three draws. If the first bead drawn is  green, then there will be one  green and three red beads in the bag before the second draw. So the probability that  green beads are drawn in the first two draws is $$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}= \\frac{1}{8}.\n$$ The probability that a  green bead is chosen, then a red bead, and then a  green bead, is $$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{32}.\n$$ Finally, the probability that a red bead is chosen then two  green beads is $$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}.\n$$ The sum of these probabilities is $$\n\\frac{1}{8}+ \\frac{3}{32}+ \\frac{1}{16}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{32}}.\n$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the setup of the problem\nWe have a bag with 2 red beads and 2 green beads. With each draw, a bead is replaced with a red bead. We want to find the probability that after three such replacements, all beads in the bag are red.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the possible outcomes for each draw\nFor each draw, there are two possible outcomes: either a red bead is drawn or a green bead is drawn.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the probability of drawing a red bead in the first draw\nSince there are 2 red beads and 4 total beads in the bag initially, the probability of drawing a red bead first is 2/4 = 1/2.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the effect of replacement on the second draw\nRegardless of the color drawn on the first draw, a red bead is added back to the bag, changing the composition to 3 red beads and 2 green beads. Thus, the probability of drawing a red bead on the second draw is 3/5.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the effect of replacement on the third draw\nAfter the second draw, the bag composition changes to 4 red beads and 1 green bead. Thus, the probability of drawing a red bead on the third draw is 4/5.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of all beads being red after three replacements\nThe probability of all events happening in sequence is the product of the individual probabilities. Therefore, we multiply the probabilities of each draw being red: (1/2) * (3/5) * (4/5).\n\n## Step 7: Perform the multiplication to find the probability\n(1/2) * (3/5) * (4/5) = (1 * 3 * 4) / (2 * 5 * 5) = 12 / 50 = 6 / 25.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{6}{25}}$"
