    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are tasked with finding the number of paths from point A to point C, with the constraint that every step must be either up or to the right.\n## Step 2:  The first step is to understand the nature of the problem. We can visualize the problem as finding the number of ways to reach point C from A by moving up or to the right in a grid, where the total number of steps is fixed.\n## Step 3:  To reach point C, we need to take a total of 3 steps up and 4 steps to the right. This forms a sequence of 7 steps, where 3 of them are ups and 4 are rights.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, this is essentially a problem of arranging 3 ups and 4 rights in a sequence of 7 steps. This is a classic combinatorics problem that can be solved using combinations.\n## Step 5:  We can choose the positions of the 3 ups in the sequence of 7 steps in $\\dbinom{7}{3}$ ways. This value represents the number of ways to choose 3 positions out of 7, which is the same as arranging 3 ups and 4 rights in the sequence of 7 steps.\n## Step 6:  By calculating $\\dbinom{7}{3}$, we can determine the total number of paths from A to C, adhering to the given constraints.\n## Step 7:  Substituting the values into the combination formula, we get $\\dbinom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35$.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{35}$ paths from point A to point C.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{35}$"
