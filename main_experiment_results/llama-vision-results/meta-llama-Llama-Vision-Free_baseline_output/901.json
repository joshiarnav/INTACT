    "problem": "In how many ways can a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer be chosen from a group of $4$ guys and $4$ girls and at least one girl and at least one guy holds at least one of those three positions? One person cannot serve in more than one position.",
    "solution": "We have $8$ choices for president, $7$ choices for vice-president, and $6$ choices for treasurer, for a total of $8\\times7\\times6 = 336$ choices. Now we have to subtract the number of choices that don't satisfy the requirement, where the $3$ officers are all boys or all girls. For either case, we have $4$ choices for president, $3$ choices of vice-president, and $2$ choices for treasurer, a total of $4\\times3\\times2 = 24$ choices. So we have $2\\times 24 = 48$ total choices that don't satisfy the requirement.\n\nThus, there are $336-48=\\boxed{288}$ good choices.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks us to determine the number of ways to choose a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer from a group of 4 guys and 4 girls, with the condition that at least one girl and at least one guy holds at least one of those three positions.\n## Step 2:  We begin by considering the total number of ways to choose the three positions without any restrictions, which is simply the number of permutations of 3 people from a total of 8, given by $P(8,3) = 8\\cdot7\\cdot6 = 336$.\n## Step 3:  However, we need to exclude the cases where all 3 positions are held by either guys or girls, as these do not meet the condition of having at least one girl and one guy in the positions.\n## Step 4:  Let's consider the number of ways in which all 3 positions are held by guys. This can be calculated as the number of permutations of 3 people from the group of 4 guys, given by $P(4,3) = 4\\cdot3\\cdot2 = 24$.\n## Step 5:  Similarly, we need to calculate the number of ways in which all 3 positions are held by girls. This is also given by $P(4,3) = 4\\cdot3\\cdot2 = 24$.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the total number of ways to choose the 3 positions with at least one girl and one guy is the difference between the total number of ways without restrictions and the sum of the cases with all guys and all girls, which is $336 - 24 - 24 = 288$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{288}$"
