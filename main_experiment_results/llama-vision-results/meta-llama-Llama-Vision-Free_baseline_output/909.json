    "problem": "There are 190 people on the beach.  110 are wearing sunglasses, 70 are wearing bathing suits, and 95 are wearing a hat.  Everyone is wearing at least one of these items. 30 are wearing both bathing suits and sunglasses. 25 are wearing both bathing suits and a hat. 40 are wearing both sunglasses and a hat.  How many people are wearing all three items?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be number of people wearing all three items.  Since 30 people are wearing bathing suits and sunglasses, we know that $30 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and sunglasses.  Similarly, $25 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and hats, while $40 - x$ are wearing just sunglasses and a hat.\n\nTo find the number of people wearing just sunglasses, we subtract the people who are wearing sunglasses with other items from the total number of people wearing sunglasses, which is $110 - (30 - x) - (40 - x) - x = 40 + x$.  Similarly, the number of people wearing just hats is $30 + x$, while the number of people wearing just bathing suits is $15 + x$.\n\nSince the total number of people on the beach is 190, and everyone is wearing one of the items, we have: \\begin{align*}\n190 &= (15 + x) + (40 + x) + (30 + x) \\\\\n&\\qquad+ (25 - x ) + (30 - x) + (40 - x) + x\\\\\n&= 180 + x.\n\\end{align*} We can then solve for $x$, so the number of people on the beach wearing all three items is $x = \\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, let's denote the total number of people on the beach as T, the number of people wearing sunglasses as S, the number wearing bathing suits as B, and the number wearing a hat as H.\n## Step 2:  From the problem, we know T = 190, S = 110, B = 70, and H = 95.\n## Step 3:  The formula to calculate the total number of people wearing at least one item, considering overlaps, is given by T = S + B + H - (S \u2229 B) - (B \u2229 H) - (S \u2229 H) + (S \u2229 B \u2229 H), where (S \u2229 B), (B \u2229 H), and (S \u2229 H) denote the number of people wearing both sunglasses and bathing suits, both bathing suits and a hat, and both sunglasses and a hat respectively, and (S \u2229 B \u2229 H) denotes the number of people wearing all three items.\n## Step 4:  We are given that 30 people are wearing both bathing suits and sunglasses (S \u2229 B), 25 are wearing both bathing suits and a hat (B \u2229 H), and 40 are wearing both sunglasses and a hat (S \u2229 H).\n## Step 5:  The formula now becomes 190 = 110 + 70 + 95 - 30 - 25 - 40 + (S \u2229 B \u2229 H).\n## Step 6:  Simplifying the equation, we get 190 = 275 - 95 + (S \u2229 B \u2229 H).\n## Step 7:  Further simplifying, we get 190 = 180 + (S \u2229 B \u2229 H).\n## Step 8:  To find the number of people wearing all three items, we rearrange the equation to solve for (S \u2229 B \u2229 H), which results in (S \u2229 B \u2229 H) = 190 - 180.\n## Step 9:  This simplifies to (S \u2229 B \u2229 H) = 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
