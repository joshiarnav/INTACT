    "solution": "Since there are 6 points, we have ${6 \\choose 2} = 15$ different line segments to connect the vertices. However, 6 of those line segments are the sides of the hexagon. The remaining $ 15 - 6 = \\boxed{9}$ segments are the diagonals of the hexagon.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are given a hexagon $ABCDEF$ and asked to find the number of diagonals it has.\n## Step 2:  To solve this problem, we can use a formula that calculates the number of diagonals in an n-gon.\n## Step 3:  For an n-gon, the number of diagonals can be found using the formula $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$.\n## Step 4:  This formula works by considering each vertex of the polygon. From each vertex, we can draw a diagonal to every other vertex, excluding the adjacent vertices.\n## Step 5:  Since there are n vertices, we might initially think there are n diagonals from each vertex, but we have to exclude the two adjacent vertices, which reduces the count to n-3 diagonals from each vertex.\n## Step 6:  However, this counts each diagonal twice (once from each of its endpoints), so we divide by 2 to get the correct count.\n## Step 7:  Applying this formula to the hexagon, which has 6 sides, we get $\\frac{6(6-3)}{2} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 3}{2} = 9$ diagonals.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the hexagon $ABCDEF$ has $\\boxed{9}$ diagonals.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$"
