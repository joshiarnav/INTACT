    "problem": "When two consecutive whole numbers are randomly selected, what is the probability that one of them is a multiple of 4? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "All whole numbers can be written as $4k$, $4k+1$, $4k+2$, or $4k+3$ for some integer $k$. Suppose we look at the smaller of the two consecutive numbers. If it is of the form $4k$, it is a multiple of 4. If it is of the form $4k+3$, the other is $4k+4$, a multiple of 4. If on the other hand, it can be written as $4k+1$ or $4k+2$, neither number is a multiple of 4. So in two of the four equally likely cases, one of the numbers is a multiple of 4, for a probability of $2/4=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the possible pairs of consecutive whole numbers\nWe can start by listing the pairs of consecutive whole numbers. Since we are dealing with whole numbers, we can consider the pairs as (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), and so on.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the pairs where one of the consecutive numbers is a multiple of 4\nWe need to find the pairs of consecutive numbers where one of them is a multiple of 4. The multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, and so on. So, the pairs that satisfy this condition are (4, 5), (8, 9), (12, 13), and so on.\n\n## Step 3: Count the number of pairs where one of the consecutive numbers is a multiple of 4\nThere are infinitely many pairs, but we can count the number of pairs in a certain range. However, since we are dealing with a probability, we can count the number of pairs in a certain range and then divide that by the total number of pairs in that range.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of pairs of consecutive whole numbers\nThe total number of pairs of consecutive whole numbers is infinite. However, we can consider a certain range, such as from 1 to 100. In this range, there are 100 pairs of consecutive numbers.\n\n## Step 5: Count the number of pairs of consecutive whole numbers where one of them is a multiple of 4\nIn the range from 1 to 100, the pairs of consecutive numbers where one of them is a multiple of 4 are (4, 5), (8, 9), (12, 13), ..., (96, 97). There are 25 such pairs.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability that one of the consecutive numbers is a multiple of 4\nThe probability is calculated by dividing the number of successful outcomes (25 pairs where one of the consecutive numbers is a multiple of 4) by the total number of outcomes (100 pairs of consecutive numbers).\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction if possible\nThe fraction is 25/100, which can be simplified to 1/4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$"
