    "problem": "A PE class has 12 students, 6 girls and 6 boys. The coach has 4 jerseys in each of 3 colors to mark 3 teams for a soccer tournament. If the coach wants at least one girl and at least one boy on each team, how many ways can he give out the jerseys? (Jerseys of the same color are indistinguishable.)",
    "solution": "In all, disregarding the gender rule, there are $$\\binom{12}4\\binom84=\\frac{12\\cdot11\\cdot10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7\\cdot6\\cdot5}{4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot4\\cdot3\\cdot2}=34650$$ways of assigning the teams. We will count the number of ways a team can have all boys or all girls and subtract from this total.\n\nThere are 2 choices for the violating gender and 3 choices for the violating color. Once these are picked, there are $\\binom64=15$ ways to choose the violating team, and $\\binom84=70$ ways to pick the other two teams, for a total of $2\\cdot3\\cdot15\\cdot70=6300$ ways to choose a violating team. However, this procedure double-counts the assignments that make one team all girls and another all boys. There are 3 choices for the girls team and then 2 choices for the boys team, and $\\binom64^2=225$ ways to choose the teams, for a total of $2\\cdot3\\cdot225=1350$ double-counted arrangements, leaving $6300-1350=4950$ ways to make a team all girls or all boys. Subtracting this from the total, we get $34650-4950=\\boxed{29700}$ ways for the coach to assign the teams.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of students to be placed on each team\nThere are 3 teams and each team should have at least one girl and one boy. The total number of students is 12, so each team must have 4 students.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to select students for each team\nSince there are 6 girls and 6 boys, the number of ways to choose 4 students (at least one girl and one boy) for each team can be calculated using combinations. However, we need to consider the cases where we select the teams with the correct gender distribution for each team.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the cases for each team selection\nFor the first team, we can select 1 girl and 3 boys or 3 girls and 1 boy. We can calculate the combinations for these cases.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate combinations for the first team selection\n- For 1 girl and 3 boys: C(6, 1) * C(6, 3)\n- For 3 girls and 1 boy: C(6, 3) * C(6, 1)\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the combinations for the other two teams\nSince the first team's selection of 1 girl and 3 boys leaves 5 girls and 3 boys, we can calculate the combinations for the second team. We will repeat this calculation for the third team.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate combinations for the second team\n- Using the same logic as step 4, we calculate combinations for the second team.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total combinations\nMultiply the combinations for each team together to get the total number of ways.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the calculation\nGiven that each jersey color is indistinguishable, we must divide the total combinations by the factorial of 3, since there are 3 teams.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate C(6, 1) and C(6, 3)\n- C(6, 1) = 6\n- C(6, 3) = 20\n\n## Step 10: Calculate combinations for the teams\nFor the first team: 6 * 20 = 120\nFor the second team: 20 * 6 = 120 (Since we have 5 girls and 3 boys left)\nFor the third team: 5 * 3 = 15 (Since we have 5 girls and 3 boys left)\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the total combinations before simplifying\n120 * 120 * 15 = 216000\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the calculation\nWe must divide the total combinations by the factorial of 3 (3!) to account for indistinguishable jersey colors.\n\n## Step 13: Calculate 3!\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n\n## Step 14: Simplify the calculation\nDivide the total combinations by 6: 216000 / 6 = 36000\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36000}$"
