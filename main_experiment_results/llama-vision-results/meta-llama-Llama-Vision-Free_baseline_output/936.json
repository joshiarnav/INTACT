    "problem": "Two jokers are added to a $52$ card deck and the entire stack of $54$ cards is shuffled randomly.  What is the expected number of cards that will be strictly between the two jokers?",
    "solution": "Each card has an equal likelihood of being either on top of the jokers, in between them, or below the jokers.  Thus, on average, $1/3$ of them will land between the two jokers. Multiplying this by the 52 yields our answer of $\\boxed{\\frac{52}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of cards that will be strictly between the two jokers in a shuffled deck of 54 cards.\n## Step 2:  We can start by considering the position of the two jokers in the deck. Since there are 54 cards in total, there are 53 possible positions for the first joker and 52 possible positions for the second joker.\n## Step 3:  Now, we need to think about how many cards will be strictly between the two jokers, which means we should exclude the jokers themselves.\n## Step 4:  If the jokers are placed at positions 1 and 2, there are 52 cards between them. If they are placed at positions 2 and 3, there are 51 cards between them, and so on.\n## Step 5:  This indicates that the number of cards between the two jokers is a decreasing value from 52 to 1.\n## Step 6:  To find the expected number of cards between the jokers, we need to calculate the average of this range.\n## Step 7:  The average of a range of values is given by the average of the first and last value. In this case, the average is $\\frac{52+1}{2}=26.5$.\n## Step 8:  However, we must note that this is not the final answer. Since there is only one position for the first joker, we don't need to average across every position, but instead, we can calculate the expected value directly.\n## Step 9:  The expected number of cards between the jokers can be found by considering the average number of cards in the range, which is given by $26.5$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the expected number of cards between the two jokers is $\\boxed{26.5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{26.5}$"
