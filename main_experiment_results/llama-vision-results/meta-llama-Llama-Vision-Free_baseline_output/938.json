    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To begin, we need to understand the conditions given in the problem. We are dealing with a set $R$ of rectangles that have specific properties: (1) only the grid points shown are used as vertices, (2) all sides are either vertical or horizontal, and (3) no two rectangles in the set are congruent.\n## Step 2:  Given these conditions, we are tasked with finding the maximum possible number of rectangles that can be included in set $R$ and then determining what fraction of these rectangles are squares.\n## Step 3:  Let's consider the possible sizes of rectangles. We can have $1$ by $1$, $1$ by $2$, $2$ by $1$, $2$ by $3$, and $3$ by $2$ rectangles. These are the only sizes that fit within the grid and satisfy the given conditions.\n## Step 4:  We start by counting the number of each type of rectangle. There are $4$ possible $1$ by $2$ rectangles, $2$ possible $2$ by $3$ rectangles, and $2$ possible $3$ by $2$ rectangles. In addition to these, there are $4$ possible $1$ by $1$ squares.\n## Step 5:  Combining these counts, we get a total of $4+2+2+4=12$ rectangles in set $R$.\n## Step 6:  Next, we consider the number of squares. There are $4$ possible $1$ by $1$ squares in the grid.\n## Step 7:  To find the fraction of rectangles that are squares, we divide the number of squares by the total number of rectangles in set $R$.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the fraction of rectangles in set $R$ that are squares is $\\frac{4}{12}=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$"
