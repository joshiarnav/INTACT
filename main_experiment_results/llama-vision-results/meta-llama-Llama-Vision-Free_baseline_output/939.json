    "problem": "How many triples $(a,b,c)$ of even positive integers satisfy $a^3 + b^2 + c \\leq 50$?",
    "solution": "If $a \\geq 4$, then $a^3+b^2+c>a^3\\geq 4^3>50$. But we want $a^3+b^2+c \\leq 50$, so we must have $a=2$.  Now we substitute $a=2$ into $a^3+b^2+c \\leq 50$, which gives $b^2+c\\leq 42$. Since $b^2<42$, we know that $b$ must be one of 2, 4, or 6.\n\nWhen $b=2,$ $c\\leq 38$. There are 19 even positive integers less than or equal to 38, namely $2\\times 1$, $2\\times 2$, $\\ldots$, $2\\times 19$.\n\nWhen $b=4,$ $c\\leq 26$. There are 13 even positive integers less than or equal to 26.\n\nWhen $b=6,$ $c\\leq 6$. There are 3 even positive integers less than or equal to 6.\n\nThus the answer is $19+13+3=\\boxed{35}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Since we are dealing with even positive integers, we can represent $a$, $b$, and $c$ as $2x$, $2y$, and $2z$ respectively, where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive integers.\n## Step 2:  Substituting these representations into the given inequality, we get $(2x)^3 + (2y)^2 + 2z \\leq 50$.\n## Step 3:  Simplifying this, we get $8x^3 + 4y^2 + 2z \\leq 50$.\n## Step 4:  Dividing the entire inequality by 2, we obtain $4x^3 + 2y^2 + z \\leq 25$.\n## Step 5:  We're looking to find the number of triples $(a,b,c)$ of even positive integers that satisfy this inequality.\n## Step 6:  The constraints on $x$, $y$, and $z$ are such that $x$ can be at most 2, $y$ can be at most 3, and $z$ can be at most 24.\n## Step 7:  We need to consider the possible values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ within these constraints and count the valid triples that satisfy the inequality.\n## Step 8:  We can systematically go through each possible combination of $x$, $y$, and $z$ within their respective ranges to find the valid triples.\n## Step 9:  By considering all possible combinations of $x$, $y$, and $z$, we can count the total number of valid triples that satisfy the inequality.\n## Step 10:  Once we have considered all the possible combinations, we can sum them up to find the total number of valid triples.\n## Step 11:  The total number of valid triples is the final answer to the problem.\n\n## Step 12:  Now we start counting the number of valid triples for each combination of $x$, $y$, and $z$.\n## Step 13:  For $x = 1$, $y$ can be 1, 2, or 3. When $y = 1$, $z$ can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, or 23, giving 23 combinations. When $y = 2$, $z$ can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, or 22, giving 22 combinations. When $y = 3$, $z$ can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, or 22, giving 22 combinations.\n## Step 14:  So, for $x = 1$, we have $23 + 22 + 22 = 67$ valid triples.\n## Step 15:  Next, for $x = 2$, $y$ can be 1, 2, or 3. When $y = 1$, $z$ can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, giving 9 combinations. When $y = 2$, $z$ can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, giving 8 combinations. When $y = 3$, $z$ can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, giving 8 combinations.\n## Step 16:  So, for $x = 2$, we have $9 + 8 + 8 = 25$ valid triples.\n\n## Step 17:  Now, let's calculate the total number of valid triples by adding the number of valid triples for $x = 1$ and $x = 2$.\n\n## Step 18:  Total number of valid triples = Number of valid triples for $x = 1$ + Number of valid triples for $x = 2$ = 67 + 25 = 92.\n\n## Step 19:  Therefore, the total number of valid triples is $\\boxed{92}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{92}$"
