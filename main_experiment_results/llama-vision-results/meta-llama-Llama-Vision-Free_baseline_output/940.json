    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find how many multiples of $9^3$ are greater than $9^4$ and less than $9^5$. This means we need to find the number of integers between $9^4$ and $9^5$ that are divisible by $9^3$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the range of multiples\nTo find this, we first need to understand the range in which we are looking for multiples of $9^3$. The lower limit is the smallest multiple of $9^3$ greater than $9^4$, and the upper limit is the largest multiple of $9^3$ less than $9^5$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the lower limit\nWe know that $9^4 = 9^3 \\times 9$. Therefore, the lower limit of the range should be greater than $9^4$, which implies we are looking for the smallest multiple of $9^3$ that exceeds $9^4$. Since $9^4$ is a multiple of $9^3$, the first multiple of $9^3$ greater than $9^4$ is $9^3 \\times 10$, but this is actually beyond our range. We should look for the first multiple of $9^3$ that is greater than $9^3$. The first multiple of $9^3$ would be $9^3 \\times 2$, so the lower limit would actually be any multiple of $9^3$ greater than $9^3$. We are looking for any multiple of $9^3$ greater than $9^3$ that is less than $9^5$, however.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the upper limit\nThe upper limit is the largest multiple of $9^3$ less than $9^5$. Since $9^5 = 9^3 \\times 9^2$, the largest multiple of $9^3$ less than $9^5$ would be $9^3 \\times 9^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the range of multiples of $9^3$\nHowever, our task is to find how many multiples of $9^3$ are greater than $9^4$ and less than $9^5$, so the range would be between $9^3$ and $9^3 \\times 9^2$, with the first multiple being $9^3$ and the last multiple being $9^3 \\times 9^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate how many multiples of $9^3$ there are in this range\nNow, we need to find the number of multiples of $9^3$ that are between $9^3$ and $9^3 \\times 9^2$.\nLet's analyze this: we have $9^3 \\times 1$ to $9^3 \\times 9^2 = 9^5$.\nThere are $9^2$ numbers between $9^3$ and $9^5$, but we need to subtract the numbers below $9^3$ that are not in our range, however since our first number $9^3$ is actually within our range we simply need to calculate the number of multiples between $9^3$ and $9^3 \\times 9^2$, which is $9^2$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the final count of multiples\nNow we calculate the final count of multiples of $9^3$ in the specified range.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the final count of multiples\nSince the range of multiples of $9^3$ is from $9^3$ to $9^3 \\times 9^2$, we simply need to count the multiples of $9^3$ within this range. We have the first multiple as $9^3$ and the last multiple as $9^3 \\times 9^2$.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the final count\nThe number of multiples of $9^3$ is equal to the largest multiple divided by $9^3$ minus the smallest multiple divided by $9^3$ plus 1.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the count of multiples\nThere are $9^2$ multiples of $9^3$ in the specified range.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the final count\nSince we know that there are $9^2$ multiples of $9^3$ between $9^3$ and $9^3 \\times 9^2$, we can simply calculate the final count of multiples of $9^3$.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the final count\nWe know that there are $9^2 = 81$ multiples of $9^3$ between $9^3$ and $9^3 \\times 9^2$.\n\n## Step 13: Determine the final answer\nSince we know that there are 81 multiples of $9^3$ between $9^3$ and $9^3 \\times 9^2$, our final answer is 81.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{81}$"
