    "problem": "What is the probability that flipping a fair coin three times produces fewer than two heads? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "This is the probability of flipping no heads (three tails) or one head (two tails). This is the same as the probability of flipping two heads (one tail) or three heads (no tails), since we can just interchange heads and tails. Since all outcomes are covered, both probabilities add up to 1, so the desired probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, let's understand the basic outcomes when flipping a fair coin three times.\nThere are 8 total outcomes: HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, TTT.\n\n## Step 2:  The question asks for the probability of getting fewer than two heads. This translates to getting 0 or 1 head(s).\nWe need to calculate the number of ways to get exactly 0 heads and exactly 1 head.\n\n## Step 3:  For exactly 0 heads, there is only one outcome: TTT.\n\n## Step 4:  For exactly 1 head, there are 3 outcomes: THT, TTH, HTT.\n\n## Step 5:  To get the total number of favorable outcomes, we add the outcomes for 0 heads and 1 head: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n## Step 6:  The total number of outcomes is 8.\n\n## Step 7:  To find the probability, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.\n\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the probability of getting fewer than two heads is 4/8, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$"
