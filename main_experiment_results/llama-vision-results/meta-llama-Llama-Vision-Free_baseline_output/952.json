    "problem": "Chris wants to put six plants in a row on his windowsill. He randomly chooses each plant to be an aloe plant, a basil plant, or a violet. What is the probability that either exactly four of the plants are aloe plants or exactly five of the plants are basil plants?",
    "solution": "It is impossible for Chris to have both four aloe plants and five basil plants, so first we consider the case of four aloe plants. There are $\\binom{6}{4}=15$ ways to choose which of the plants are the aloe plants. For each of these choices, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) ^2$ chance of that choice happening. Therefore, the total probability that Chris chooses exactly four aloe plants is $15\\cdot\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) ^2=\\frac{20}{243}$. There are $\\binom{6}{5}=6$ ways to choose five plants to be the basil plants. For each of these choices, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^5 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) ^1$ chance of that choice happening. Therefore, the total probability that Chris chooses exactly five basil plants is $6\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^5 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) ^1=\\frac{4}{243}$. The probability that Chris chooses either four aloe plants or five basil plants is $\\frac{24}{243}=\\boxed{\\frac{8}{81}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible plant arrangements for six plants with three options each.\nThere are 3 options for each of the 6 plants, so the total number of possible arrangements is $3^6 = 729$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose exactly four aloe plants out of six plants.\nWe use the combination formula to find the number of ways to choose 4 aloe plants out of 6, which is $\\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{6!}{4!2!} = 15$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the remaining two plants (basil and violet) around the 4 aloe plants.\nFor each arrangement of 4 aloe plants, we have 2 remaining spots, which can be filled with 2 basil and 1 violet, or 1 basil and 2 violets. This gives us a total of $2 \\times 2 = 4$ possible arrangements for each of the 15 ways to choose 4 aloe plants.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose exactly five basil plants out of six plants.\nSimilarly, we use the combination formula to find the number of ways to choose 5 basil plants out of 6, which is $\\binom{6}{5} = \\frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the remaining one plant (either aloe or violet) around the 5 basil plants.\nFor each arrangement of 5 basil plants, we have 1 remaining spot, which can be filled with 1 aloe plant or 1 violet. This gives us a total of $1 \\times 2 = 2$ possible arrangements for each of the 6 ways to choose 5 basil plants.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of successful outcomes for exactly four aloe plants or exactly five basil plants.\nThe total number of successful outcomes for exactly four aloe plants is $15 \\times 4 = 60$. The total number of successful outcomes for exactly five basil plants is $6 \\times 2 = 12$. The total number of successful outcomes is $60 + 12 = 72$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability of getting exactly four aloe plants or exactly five basil plants.\nThe probability is the total number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is $\\frac{72}{729}$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the probability fraction.\nThe fraction $\\frac{72}{729}$ can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9. This gives us $\\frac{8}{81}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{81}}$"
