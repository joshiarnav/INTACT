    "problem": "We call a number a descending number if each digit is strictly smaller than the digit that comes before it.  For example, 863 is a descending number.  How many 3-digit descending numbers are there?",
    "solution": "For every 3 different digits, there is one corresponding descending number, which is just the digits in descending order.  So the answer is the number of combinations of three different digits, which is  $\\binom{10}{3} = \\boxed{120}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define what a 3-digit descending number is\nA 3-digit descending number is a number with three digits where each digit is strictly smaller than the digit that comes before it.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the possible values for the hundreds digit\nSince the number is a 3-digit number, the hundreds digit cannot be zero. Therefore, the hundreds digit can be any number from 1 to 9, inclusive.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the possible values for the tens digit\nThe tens digit must be less than the hundreds digit. Since the hundreds digit can be any number from 1 to 9, the tens digit can be any number from 0 to the hundreds digit minus 1.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the possible values for the ones digit\nThe ones digit must be less than the tens digit. Therefore, the ones digit can be any number from 0 to the tens digit minus 1.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of possible combinations for each case\nSince the hundreds digit can be any number from 1 to 9, there are 9 possibilities for the hundreds digit. For each of these possibilities, the tens digit can be any number from 0 to 8 minus the hundreds digit, which gives 9 possibilities for the tens digit when the hundreds digit is 1, but 8 possibilities when the hundreds digit is 2, 7 possibilities when the hundreds digit is 3, and so on, until 0 possibilities when the hundreds digit is 9. Therefore, the total number of 3-digit descending numbers is given by the sum of the products of the number of possibilities for the hundreds and tens digits for each case.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of possible 3-digit descending numbers\nWe need to calculate the sum of the products of the number of possibilities for the hundreds and tens digits for each case. There are 9 possibilities for the hundreds digit. When the hundreds digit is 1, there are 9 possibilities for the tens digit. When the hundreds digit is 2, there are 8 possibilities for the tens digit. When the hundreds digit is 3, there are 7 possibilities for the tens digit. When the hundreds digit is 4, there are 6 possibilities for the tens digit. When the hundreds digit is 5, there are 5 possibilities for the tens digit. When the hundreds digit is 6, there are 4 possibilities for the tens digit. When the hundreds digit is 7, there are 3 possibilities for the tens digit. When the hundreds digit is 8, there are 2 possibilities for the tens digit. When the hundreds digit is 9, there is 1 possibility for the tens digit.\n\n## Step 7: Sum up the products for each case\nThe sum of the products is (9\u00d79) + (8\u00d78) + (7\u00d77) + (6\u00d76) + (5\u00d75) + (4\u00d74) + (3\u00d73) + (2\u00d72) + (1\u00d71) = 81 + 64 + 49 + 36 + 25 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 285.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{285}$"
