    "problem": "I have two cubes such that, on each cube, three faces are painted red and three faces are painted white. If I roll each of the cubes once, what is the probability that they will land such that there is one red face and one white face up?",
    "solution": "There are four possible ways for the cubes to land: two red faces up, the first with a red face and the second with a white face up, the first with a white face and the second with a red face up, and two white faces up. So, there are two ways that the cubes can land such that there is a red face up and a white face up. The probability that we get a red face up is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, the probability that we get a white face up is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the probability that the cubes land such that there is one red face and one white face up is $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\nAlternate solution: After you roll the first cube, the second one must be the other color, which occurs with probability $\\frac{3}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the possible outcomes for each cube\nEach cube has 6 faces, with 3 faces painted red and 3 faces painted white. When rolling one cube, there are 6 possible outcomes for the top face landing.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the favorable outcomes for the first cube\nFor the first cube to land with one red face up, there are 3 possible outcomes (3 red faces). Similarly, for the first cube to land with one white face up, there are 3 possible outcomes (3 white faces).\n\n## Step 3: Identify the favorable outcomes for the second cube\nFor the second cube to land with one red face up, there are 3 possible outcomes (3 red faces). Similarly, for the second cube to land with one white face up, there are 3 possible outcomes (3 white faces).\n\n## Step 4: Determine the total number of outcomes when rolling two cubes\nSince each cube has 6 possible outcomes, the total number of outcomes when rolling two cubes is 6 x 6 = 36.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the number of favorable outcomes for the combined rolls\nFor the combined rolls to land with one red face and one white face up, there are 3 x 3 = 9 possible outcomes. However, this accounts for the cases where one cube lands with a red face up and the other lands with a white face up (3 red x 3 white). We must also consider the cases where one cube lands with a white face up and the other lands with a red face up (3 white x 3 red), which is the same as above. Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 9 + 9 = 18.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of the desired outcome\nHowever, we must correct our approach in step 5. The situation is easier to analyze by considering the possible outcomes of one cube and then matching it with the possible outcomes of the other cube. There are 3 red faces and 3 white faces on each cube. So, for one cube, the probability it lands with a red face up is 1/2, and the probability it lands with a white face up is also 1/2. When rolling two cubes, the situations in which we get one red and one white face up are mutually exclusive. There are two cases: (i) the first cube lands red, and the second lands white, or (ii) the first cube lands white, and the second lands red. The probability of case (i) is 3/6 x 3/6 = 9/36, and the probability of case (ii) is also 9/36. So the total probability is 9/36 + 9/36.\n\n## Step 7: Perform the addition\n9/36 + 9/36 = 18/36.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the fraction\nWe can simplify the fraction 18/36 by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 18. 18/18 = 1, and 36/18 = 2. So, 18/36 simplifies to 1/2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$"
