    "problem": "A Senate committee consists of 5 Republicans, 6 Democrats, and 2 Independents.  A subcommittee of 3 members is randomly chosen.  What is the probability that the subcommittee consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent?",
    "solution": "There are 5 ways to choose a Republican, 6 ways to choose a Democrat, and 2 ways to choose an Independent for a total of $5 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 60$ different subcommittees of a Republican, Democrat, and Independent.   There are $\\binom{13}{3} = \\dfrac{13\\cdot12\\cdot 11}{3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1} = 286$ ways to choose 3 people from 13 to form a committee, so there are 286 possible committees. Therefore, the probability that the subcommittee is made up of a Republican, Democrat, and Independent is $\\dfrac{60}{286} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{30}{143}}$ .",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of subcommittees that can be formed\nThe total number of subcommittees that can be formed from 13 members is given by the combination formula: $13C3 = \\frac{13!}{3!(13-3)!}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of subcommittees consisting of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent\nTo form a subcommittee with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent, we can choose 1 Republican from 5 Republicans, 1 Democrat from 6 Democrats, and 1 Independent from 2 Independents. The number of ways to do this is given by the product of the combinations: $5C1 \\times 6C1 \\times 2C1$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the combination formulas\nThe total number of subcommittees is $13C3 = \\frac{13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 286$. The number of subcommittees with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent is $5C1 \\times 6C1 \\times 2C1 = 5 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 60$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability\nThe probability of choosing a subcommittee with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent is the number of subcommittees with this composition divided by the total number of subcommittees: $\\frac{60}{286}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the probability fraction\nTo simplify the fraction, find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator. The greatest common divisor of 60 and 286 is 2. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2: $\\frac{60}{286} = \\frac{30}{143}$.\n\n## Step 6: Reduce the fraction to its simplest form\nThe fraction $\\frac{30}{143}$ is already in its simplest form.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{30}{143}}$"
