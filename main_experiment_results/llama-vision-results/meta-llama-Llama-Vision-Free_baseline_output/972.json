    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of letters in the word CIRCLE\nThe word CIRCLE has 7 letters.\n\n## Step 2: Identify and count the repeating letters in the word CIRCLE\nIn the word CIRCLE, there are 2 C's, 2 I's, and 1 R, 1 L, and 1 E.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the formula for permutations with repetition to calculate the number of arrangements\nThe formula for permutations with repetition is n! / (n1! * n2! * ...), where n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, etc., are the counts of each repeating item. In this case, n = 7, n1 = 2 for C, n2 = 2 for I, and the rest are single occurrences.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the factorial of the total number of letters (n)\n7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the factorial of each repeating letter\n2! for both C and I, which is 2 * 1 = 2.\n\n## Step 6: Plug the values into the permutations with repetition formula\nThe formula becomes 5040 / (2 * 2).\n\n## Step 7: Perform the division\n5040 / (2 * 2) = 5040 / 4 = 1260.\n\n## Step 8: Write the final answer\n1260.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1260}$"
