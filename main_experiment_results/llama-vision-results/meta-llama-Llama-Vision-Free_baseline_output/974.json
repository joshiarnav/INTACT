    "problem": "How many of the factorials from 1! to 100! are divisible by 9?",
    "solution": "To have 9 as a factor, $n!$ must have two factors of 3.  The first such $n$ for which this is true is 6, since  $6! = \\textbf{6} \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times \\textbf{3} \\times 2 \\times 1$.  Since 9 is a factor of $6!$ and $6!$ is a factor of $n!$ for all $n \\ge 6$, the numbers $6!, 7!, 8!, \\ldots, 99!, 100!$ are all divisible by 9.  There are $100 - 6 + 1 = \\boxed{95}$ numbers in that list.",

Hence every factorial from 1! to 100! will contain at least one factor of 9.\n\n## Step 7: Determine how many multiples of 9 there are from 1 to 100.\nThere are 11 multiples of 9 between 1 and 100: 9, 18, 27, ... 99.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the case where a factorial contains more than one factor of 9.\nAny number that contains more than one factor of 9 will also be divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 9: Notice that every multiple of 9 squared is divisible by 9 squared.\nSince any multiple of 9 squared will contain more than one factor of 9, it will also be divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 10: Determine how many multiples of 9 squared there are from 1 to 100.\nThere are 3 multiples of 9 squared between 1 and 100: 9^2=81 and 9^3 is greater than 100.\n\n## Step 11: Consider the case where a factorial contains more than one factor of 9 squared.\nAny number that contains more than one factor of 9 squared will also be divisible by 9 squared.\n\n## Step 12: Notice that every multiple of 9 cubed is divisible by 9 cubed.\nSince any multiple of 9 cubed will contain more than one factor of 9 squared, it will also be divisible by 9 squared.\n\n## Step 13: Determine how many multiples of 9 cubed there are from 1 to 100.\nThere are 1 multiples of 9 cubed between 1 and 100: 9^3 = 729 is greater than 100.\n\n## Step 14: Realize that there are multiples of 9 cubed between 1 and 100.\nSince 9^3 is greater than 100, there are no multiples of 9 cubed between 1 and 100.\n\n## Step 15: Consider the case where a factorial contains more than one factor of 9 cubed.\nAny number that contains more than one factor of 9 cubed will also be divisible by 9 cubed.\n\n## Step 16: Notice that every multiple of 9 to the power of n, where n is 4 or greater, is greater than 100.\nSince any multiple of 9 to the power of 4 or greater will be greater than 100, it will not be a factor of any factorial from 1! to 100!.\n\n## Step 17: Understand that all factorials from 1! to 100! will have multiples of 9, 9 squared, but not 9 cubed.\nSince 9^3 is greater than 100, no factorial from 1! to 100! contains 9 cubed.\n\n## Step 18: Determine that every factorial from 1! to 100! will contain at least one multiple of 9, but not necessarily 9 squared.\nSince every factorial will contain a multiple of 9, but not necessarily a multiple of 9 squared, we can conclude that every factorial from 1! to 100! is divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 19: Determine that there are 100 numbers from 1 to 100, inclusive.\nThere are 100 numbers from 1 to 100, inclusive.\n\n## Step 20: Since every factorial from 1! to 100! is divisible by 9, we can conclude that the answer is 100.\nSince every factorial from 1! to 100! is divisible by 9, we can conclude that the answer is 100.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{100}$"
