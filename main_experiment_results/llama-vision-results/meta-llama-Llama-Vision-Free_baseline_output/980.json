    "problem": "If we flip 6 coins, what is the probability of getting at least 2 heads?",
    "solution": "There are $2^6 = 64$ possible outcomes, since each of the 6 coins has 2 possibilities.  If we do not get at least 2 heads, then we get either no heads or one heads.  There is only 1 way to get 0 heads, and $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to get 1 head, so the probability of getting at most one head is $\\dfrac{7}{64}$.  Therefore, the probability of getting at least 2 heads is $1-\\dfrac{7}{64}=\\boxed{\\frac{57}{64}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the possible outcomes when flipping 6 coins.\nFlipping 6 coins gives 2^6 = 64 possible outcomes because each coin has 2 possible outcomes: heads or tails.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to get exactly 2 heads.\nThis can be calculated using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of flips (6) and k is the number of heads we want (2). Therefore, C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to get exactly 3 heads.\nUsing the same combination formula, C(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 20.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to get exactly 4 heads.\nUsing the combination formula again, C(6, 4) = 6! / (4!(6-4)!) = 15.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to get exactly 5 heads.\nC(6, 5) = 6! / (5!(6-5)!) = 6.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to get exactly 6 heads.\nC(6, 6) = 6! / (6!(6-6)!) = 1.\n\n## Step 7: Sum the number of ways to get at least 2 heads.\nThe total number of ways to get at least 2 heads is the sum of the outcomes from steps 2 through 6: 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 57.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the probability of getting at least 2 heads.\nDivide the total number of ways to get at least 2 heads by the total number of possible outcomes: 57 / 64.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the fraction to obtain the final probability.\nThe fraction 57/64 is already in its simplest form.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{57}{64}}$"
