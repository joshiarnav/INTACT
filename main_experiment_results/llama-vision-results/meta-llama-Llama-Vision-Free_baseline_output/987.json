    "problem": "23 people attend a party. Each person shakes hands with at least one other person. What is the minimum possible number of handshakes?",
    "solution": "If each person shakes hands with exactly one other person, then there will be $\\frac{23 \\cdot 1}{2}$ handshakes, since two people are required to complete a handshake. This is equal to 11.5 handshakes, which is clearly impossible. We can achieve 12 handshakes by forming two rows of 11 and 12 people. Each person in the first row shakes hands a different person in the second row. This will give eleven handshakes. The leftover person must shake hands with someone, giving $\\boxed{12}$ handshakes total.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the minimum possible number of handshakes, we should consider the scenario that minimizes the number of handshakes while still ensuring each person shakes hands with at least one other person.\n## Step 2:  The most efficient way to minimize handshakes is to arrange the people in a circle. This way, each person is only shaking hands with two others, which is the minimum number of handshakes required for each person.\n## Step 3:  In a circle of 23 people, each person shakes hands with two neighbors, resulting in a total of 23 handshakes.\n## Step 4:  However, we have to remember that each handshake involves two people, so we need to divide the total count by 2 to avoid counting each handshake twice.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the minimum possible number of handshakes is $\\frac{23 \\times 2}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{23}$"
