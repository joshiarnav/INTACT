    "problem": "On the $xy$-plane, the origin is labeled with an $M$. The points $(1,0)$, $(-1,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(0,-1)$ are labeled with $A$'s. The points $(2,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(0,2)$, $(-1, 1)$, $(-2, 0)$, $(-1, -1)$, $(0, -2)$, and $(1, -1)$ are labeled with $T$'s. The points $(3,0)$, $(2,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(0, 3)$, $(-1, 2)$, $(-2, 1)$, $(-3, 0)$, $(-2,-1)$, $(-1,-2)$, $(0, -3)$, $(1, -2)$, and $(2, -1)$ are labeled with $H$'s. If you are only allowed to move up, down, left, and right, starting from the origin, how many distinct paths can be followed to spell the word MATH?",
    "solution": "From the M, we can proceed to four different As. Note that the letters are all symmetric, so we can simply count one case (say, that of moving from M to the bottom A) and then multiply by four.\n\nFrom the bottom A, we can proceed to any one of three Ts. From the two Ts to the sides of the A, we can proceed to one of two Hs. From the T that is below the A, we can proceed to one of three Hs. Thus, this case yields $2 \\cdot 2 + 3 = 7$ paths.\n\nThus, there are $4 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{28}$ distinct paths.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1\nThe problem asks for the number of distinct paths that can be followed to spell the word MATH on the xy-plane, starting from the origin. This means that we can only move up, down, left, or right, and we need to visit the points labeled with M, A, T, and H in the correct order to spell the word MATH. For M, we can only go right. For A, we can go right or up. For T, we can go right, up, or left. For H, we can go right, up, left, or down. \n\n## Step 2\nThe number of ways to spell MATH is the product of the number of ways to spell M, A, T, and H. We can obtain this by counting the number of distinct paths to each point. For M, the only point is (0,0), so there is 1 way to spell M. For A, there are 2 points to choose from, (1,0) or (0,1), so there are 2 ways to spell A. For T, there are 8 points to choose from, so there are 8 ways to spell T. For H, there are 12 points to choose from, so there are 12 ways to spell H. \n\n## Step 3\nSince there is only one way to spell M, there are 2 ways to spell A, there are 8 ways to spell T, and there are 12 ways to spell H, the total number of distinct paths that can be followed to spell the word MATH is the product of these values, which is 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 12 = 192.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{192}$"
