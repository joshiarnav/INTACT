    "problem": "A theater group has eight members, of which four are females. How many ways are there to assign the roles of a play that involve one female lead, one male lead, and three different objects that can be played by either gender?",
    "solution": "There are 4 ways to select the female lead and 4 ways to select the male lead. Afterwards, there are 6 members who can play the first inanimate object, 5 who can play the second, and 4 for the last.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $4\\times4\\times6\\times5\\times4 = \\boxed{1920\\text{ ways.}}$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to select the female lead.\nThere are four female members, so there are four different ways to select the female lead.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to select the male lead after the female lead is chosen.\nSince there are eight members in total and one female lead has already been selected, there are seven members left. Out of these seven members, four are females, and the male lead should not be chosen from the females. Therefore, there are seven - four = three male members. Thus, there are three different ways to select the male lead.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to select the three remaining roles.\nAfter the female and male leads are chosen, there are six members left, and any of the three roles can be played by either gender. This means for each role, there are six choices.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the rule of product for counting.\nTo find the total number of ways to assign the roles, we need to multiply the number of choices at each step. The number of ways to assign the female lead is 4, the number of ways to assign the male lead is 3, and the number of ways to assign the three remaining roles is 6 * 5 * 4 = 120.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of ways to assign the roles.\nMultiply the number of choices at each step: 4 * 3 * 120.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the multiplication.\n4 * 3 * 120 = 4 * 360 = 1440.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1440}$"
