    "problem": "Each digit in the number 2001 is placed on a different card. In how many ways can three different cards be selected so that the product of the numbers on those cards is not zero?",
    "solution": "There are four cards total, two of which have a zero on them. If three cards are selected, therefore, at least one of them must have a zero on it, making the product of the numbers on those three cards zero. Thus, there are $\\boxed{0}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the conditions under which the product of the numbers on three different cards from the number 2001 (which are 2, 0, 0, and 1) would not be zero.\n## Step 2:  The product of these numbers would only be zero if we select any card with the digit 0, because any number multiplied by zero is zero. Thus, we need to find combinations that do not include a zero.\n## Step 3:  Since we have two zeros in the number 2001, we have two scenarios to consider: selecting both zeros, or selecting only one zero.\n## Step 4:  The first scenario (selecting both zeros) is impossible because we are selecting only three cards, and we cannot choose two zero cards without also choosing a non-zero card, which would actually be a card with a 2 or a 1.\n## Step 5:  In the second scenario (selecting only one zero), we can choose one of the two zero cards in 2 ways (since there are two zeros), and we must also choose one of the two non-zero cards in 2 ways (since there are two non-zero digits in the number 2001).\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the total number of ways to select three cards so that the product of the numbers on those cards is not zero is the number of ways to choose one zero card, times the number of ways to choose one non-zero card:  $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n## Step 7:  However, we must remember that we are selecting three cards, which means we need to choose one card from each category (one zero and two non-zero cards). The two non-zero cards can be chosen in $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ way, because we must choose both the 2 and the 1.\n## Step 8:  Since we are choosing only one zero card and two non-zero cards, the total number of ways to select three cards so that the product of the numbers on those cards is not zero is $1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
