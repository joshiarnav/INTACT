    "problem": "How many three-digit positive integers are multiples of 11?",
    "solution": "The first three-digit positive integer that is a multiple of 11 is 110, which is $11\\times 10$.  The last is 990, which is $11\\times 90$.  So, the number of three-digit multiples of 11 is the same as the number of numbers in the list $10, 11, 12, \\ldots, 90$, which is $90-10+1 = \\boxed{81}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the number of three-digit positive integers that are multiples of 11, we need to determine the range of three-digit multiples of 11.\n## Step 2:  The smallest three-digit multiple of 11 is 110, and the largest is 990.\n## Step 3:  We can find the number of multiples of 11 within this range by calculating the difference between the largest and smallest multiples, and then dividing by 11, and finally adding 1 to include both the endpoints of the range.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, the number of three-digit positive integers that are multiples of 11 is given by the expression $\\frac{990 - 110}{11} + 1$.\n## Step 5:  This simplifies to $\\frac{880}{11} + 1$.\n## Step 6:  Performing the division, we get $80 + 1$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the total number of three-digit positive integers that are multiples of 11 is $80 + 1 = 81$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{81}$"
