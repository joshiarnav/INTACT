    "problem": "The probability of rain tomorrow is $\\frac{1}{11}$.  What is the probability that it will not rain tomorrow?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "It must either rain tomorrow or not rain tomorrow, so the sum of the probability that it rains and the probability it doesn't rain is 1.  Therefore, the probability it doesn't rain is $1 - \\frac{1}{11} = \\boxed{\\frac{10}{11}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the probability of it raining tomorrow\nThe probability of rain tomorrow is given as $\\frac{1}{11}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of it not raining tomorrow\nSince the only two possible outcomes are rain or no rain, and these outcomes are mutually exclusive, we can find the probability of it not raining by subtracting the probability of rain from 1. Therefore, the probability of it not raining tomorrow is $1 - \\frac{1}{11}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression\nTo simplify $1 - \\frac{1}{11}$, we can rewrite 1 as $\\frac{11}{11}$ and then subtract $\\frac{1}{11}$ from it, which gives us $\\frac{11}{11} - \\frac{1}{11} = \\frac{10}{11}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{10}{11}}$"
