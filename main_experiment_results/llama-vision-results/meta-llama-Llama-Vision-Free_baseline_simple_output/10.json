    "problem": "$n$ fair 6-sided dice are simultaneously rolled. The probability that exactly two of them show a number other than 1 is $\\frac{25}{216}$. Find $n$.",
    "solution": "For $n$ dice, there are $\\binom{n}{2}=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ ways to choose two of them. For each of these ways, there is a $\\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^{n-2}$ chance that all but the chosen two dice will roll a 1. Therefore, we need to find the value of $n$ for which $\\frac{25n(n-1)}{2 \\cdot 6^n}=\\frac{25}{216}$, or $108n(n-1)=6^n$. Plugging in values for $n$, we can see that $n=\\boxed{4}$ works and no value of $n$ less than 4 works. Now we just need to prove that no values of $n$ greater than 4 work. Note that if $n \\geq 5$, then $n < 3^{n-3}$ and $n-1 < 2\\cdot 2^{n-3}$. We can multiply these inequalities to get that when $n \\geq 5$, we have $n(n-1) < 2\\cdot 6^{n-3}$, or $108n(n-1)<6^n$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1\nWe first consider the case when $n=5$. We can calculate the total number of outcomes when rolling 5 dice. Since each die has 6 sides, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling 5 dice is $6^5$.\n\n## Step 2\nNext, we need to determine the number of outcomes that result in exactly two dice showing a number other than 1.\n\n## Step 3\nThere are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which two dice will show a number other than 1. For each of these 10 ways, the probability that the chosen dice show a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, and the other three dice show a 1, is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3$.\n\n## Step 4\nTherefore, the probability of getting exactly two dice showing a number other than 1, when rolling 5 dice, is $10\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3=\\frac{25}{324}$.\n\n## Step 5\nSince this is not equal to $\\frac{25}{216}$, we can eliminate the case $n=5$.\n\n## Step 6\nNow we consider the case when $n=6$. We can calculate the total number of outcomes when rolling 6 dice. Since each die has 6 sides, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling 6 dice is $6^6$.\n\n## Step 7\nNext, we need to determine the number of outcomes that result in exactly two dice showing a number other than 1.\n\n## Step 8\nThere are $\\binom{6}{2}=15$ ways to choose which two dice will show a number other than 1. For each of these 15 ways, the probability that the chosen dice show a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, and the other four dice show a 1, is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^4$.\n\n## Step 9\nTherefore, the probability of getting exactly two dice showing a number other than 1, when rolling 6 dice, is $15\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^4=\\frac{25}{324}$.\n\n## Step 10\nSince this is not equal to $\\frac{25}{216}$, we can eliminate the case $n=6$.\n\n## Step 11\nNow we consider the case when $n=7$. We can calculate the total number of outcomes when rolling 7 dice. Since each die has 6 sides, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling 7 dice is $6^7$.\n\n## Step 12\nNext, we need to determine the number of outcomes that result in exactly two dice showing a number other than 1.\n\n## Step 13\nThere are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ ways to choose which two dice will show a number other than 1. For each of these 21 ways, the probability that the chosen dice show a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, and the other five dice show a 1, is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^5$.\n\n## Step 14\nTherefore, the probability of getting exactly two dice showing a number other than 1, when rolling 7 dice, is $21\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^5=\\frac{25}{216}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
