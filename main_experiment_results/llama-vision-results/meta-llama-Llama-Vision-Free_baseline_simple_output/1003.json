    "problem": "When rolling a certain unfair six-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the probability of obtaining face $F$ is greater than $1/6$, the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is less than $1/6$, the probability of obtaining each of the other faces is $1/6$, and the sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces is 7. When two such dice are rolled, the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $ \\frac{47}{288} $. Given that the probability of obtaining face $F$ is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.",
    "solution": "Let $p(a,b)$ denote the probability of obtaining  $a$ on the first die and $b$ on the second.  Then the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $$p(1,6)+p(2,5)+p(3,4)+p(4,3)+p(5,2)+p(6,1).$$Let the probability of obtaining face $F$ be $(1/6)+x$.  Then the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is $(1/6)-x$. Therefore $$\\begin{aligned}{{47}\\over{288}}&=\n4\\left({1\\over6}\\right)^2+2\\left({1\\over6}+x\\right)\n\\left({1\\over6}-x\\right)\\cr&=\n{4\\over36}+2\\left({1\\over36}-x^2\\right)\\cr&=\n{1\\over6}-2x^2.\\end{aligned}$$Then $2x^2=1/288$, and so $x=1/24$. The probability of obtaining face $F$ is therefore $(1/6)+(1/24)=5/24$, and $m+n=\\boxed{29}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem and understand the constraints.\nWe have an unfair six-sided die with faces numbered 1 through 6, where the probability of obtaining face $F$ is greater than $1/6$, the probability of obtaining the face opposite $F$ is less than $1/6$, and the probability of obtaining each of the other faces is $1/6$. The sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces is 7.\n\n## Step 2: Denote the probability of obtaining face $F$ as $x$, then the probability of obtaining its opposite face will be $1/6 - x$.\nBecause the probability of obtaining each of the other faces is $1/6$ and there are four such faces, the sum of the probabilities of obtaining all these faces is $4\\cdot 1/6 = 2/3$, therefore the sum of $x$ and $1/6 - x$ should also be $1/3$. This is because the sum of all probabilities must be $1$, and the other four faces have a probability of $1/6$ each, which adds up to $2/3$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the values of $x$ and $1/6-x$.\nWe find the possible range of $x$. We have $x > 1/6$ and $1/6-x < 1/6$. This gives us $x > 1/6$ and $x < 1/2$, so $1/6 < x < 1/2$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the given information to set up an equation to find the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 when rolling two dice.\nWe know that the sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces is 7. If we denote the value of face $F$ as $a$, then the value of its opposite face will be $7-a$. The probability of obtaining a sum of 7 in two rolls is then given by the sum of probabilities of the following pairs: $(a,7-a)$, $(7-a,a)$, $(a,a)$, $(7-a,7-a)$, $(a,4)$, $(4,a)$, $(3,4)$, $(4,3)$, $(2,5)$, $(5,2)$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probabilities for each case using the values of $x$ and $1/6-x$.\nWe know that the probability of obtaining $F$ is $x$ and the probability of obtaining its opposite face is $1/6-x$. The probability of obtaining each of the other faces is $1/6$. The equation for the sum of probabilities will then be: $x^2 + (1/6-x)^2 + 4\\cdot 1/36 + 4\\cdot x\\cdot (1/6-x) + 2\\cdot 1/36 + 2\\cdot x\\cdot (1/6) + 2\\cdot (1/6-x)\\cdot (1/6) = 47/288$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the equation and find the value of $x$.\nWe simplify the equation to get $x^2 + (1/6-x)^2 + 4x(1/6-x)/6 + 2x/6 + 2(1/6-x)/6 = 47/288$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $x$.\nSolving this equation, we get $x =  \\frac{5}{12}.$\n\n## Step 8: Compute $m + n$ given that $x = m/n$.\nWe know that $m/n = 5/12$, so $m + n = 5 + 12 = 17$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17}$"
