    "problem": "How many numbers between 1 and 2005 are integer multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12?",
    "solution": "Since $\\frac{2005}{3} = 668\\frac13$, there are 668 multiples of 3 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\\frac{2005}{4} = 501\\frac14$, there are 501 multiples of 4 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\\frac{2005}{12} = 167\\frac{1}{12}$, there are 167 multiples of 12 between 1 and 2005.\n\nEvery multiple of 12 is also a multiple of 3 and of 4, so there are $668-167 = 501$ multiples of 3 that are not multiples of 12 and $501-167 = 334$ multiples of 4 that are not multiples of 12.  That leaves $501 + 334 = \\boxed{835}$ numbers that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12.  (Note: no number can be a multiple of 3 and 4 without also being a multiple of 12.  So, no number is included twice in our count $501+334$.)",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of multiples of 3 and 4 between 1 and 2005.\n## Step 2:  We start by finding the number of multiples of 3. We can do this by dividing 2005 by 3 and taking the floor of the result, which gives us $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2005}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 668$.\n## Step 3:  Similarly, we find the number of multiples of 4 by dividing 2005 by 4 and taking the floor of the result, giving us $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2005}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 501$.\n## Step 4:  However, we need to account for the numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 4, which are multiples of 12. The number of multiples of 12 between 1 and 2005 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2005}{12} \\right\\rfloor = 167$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of multiples of 3 or 4. We add the number of multiples of 3 and 4 and then subtract the number of multiples of 12 to avoid double counting.\n## Step 6:  So, the total number of multiples of 3 or 4 is $668 + 501 - 167 = 1002$.\n## Step 7:  However, we need to exclude the numbers that are multiples of 12. We have already counted these numbers in our previous step, so we need to add them back to the total to exclude them.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the final answer is $1002 - 167 = \\boxed{835}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{835}$"
