    "problem": "Amy's grandmother gave her 3 identical chocolate chip cookies and 4 identical sugar cookies.  In how many different orders can Amy eat the cookies such that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both?",
    "solution": "We can solve this using complementary counting by finding the number of ways Amy can eat the cookies without eating a chocolate chip cookie first or last, and subtracting that value from the total number of ways Amy can eat the cookies. Since all the chocolate cookies are identical and all the sugar cookies are identical, there are $$\\dbinom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!}=35$$total ways for Amy to eat the cookies. If Amy doesn't eat a chocolate chip cookie first or last, there are $$\\dbinom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!2!}=10$$ways for her to eat the cookies. So, there are $35-10=\\boxed{25}$ ways in which Amy can eat the cookies such that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, let's break down the problem and understand what we're asked to find. Amy has 3 identical chocolate chip cookies and 4 identical sugar cookies, and we need to determine in how many different orders she can eat the cookies such that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both.\n## Step 2:  To approach this, we can calculate the total number of ways Amy can eat the cookies where she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, the total number of ways she can eat the cookies where she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, and then subtract the number of ways she eats a chocolate chip cookie both first and last.\n## Step 3:  Let's consider the order in which she eats the cookies. If she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, there are $7$ choices for where she eats it (since the cookies are identical, we only care about the order, not the specific cookie that is eaten first), and then $6$ remaining cookies, so there are $7 \\cdot 6!$ ways to eat the cookies with a chocolate chip cookie first.\n## Step 4:  Similarly, if she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, there are $7$ choices for where she eats it, and then $6!$ ways to arrange the other cookies, so there are also $7 \\cdot 6!$ ways to eat the cookies with a chocolate chip cookie last.\n## Step 5:  To find the number of ways she eats a chocolate chip cookie both first and last, we have $6$ remaining cookies to order, so there are $6!$ ways to do this.\n## Step 6:  Now, to find the total number of ways Amy can eat the cookies such that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both, we need to add the number of ways she eats a chocolate chip cookie first and the number of ways she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, and subtract the number of ways she eats a chocolate chip cookie both first and last.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the total number of ways Amy can eat the cookies is $7 \\cdot 6! + 7 \\cdot 6! - 6! = 14 \\cdot 6!$.\n## Step 8:  We can calculate $6! = 720$, and then $14 \\cdot 6! = 14 \\cdot 720 = \\boxed{10080}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10080}$"
