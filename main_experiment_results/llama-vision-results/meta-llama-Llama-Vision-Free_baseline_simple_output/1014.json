    "problem": "Suppose that I have $6$ different books, $2$ of which are math books. In how many ways can I stack my $6$ books on a shelf if I do not want the math books to be next to each other?",
    "solution": "We first place the non-math books. There are $4$ choices for the first book, $3$ choices for the second book, $2$ choices for the third book, and $1$ choice for the last book. Then we have to put the two math books between the four non-math books such that there is at least one non-math book between the two math books. We see there is a total of $5$ openings created by the four non-math books. So the first math book has $5$ choices, and the second math book has $4$ choices.\n\nSo the total number of ways the books can be placed is $4\\times3\\times2\\times1\\times5\\times 4 =\\boxed{480}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We first need to understand the problem and what it is asking for. We have 6 different books, 2 of which are math books, and we want to know how many ways we can stack them on a shelf without having the math books next to each other.\n\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, let's consider the total number of ways to arrange the 6 books without any restrictions. This can be calculated using the factorial function, denoted as 6!. This means we have 6 choices for the first book, 5 choices for the second book, 4 choices for the third book, 3 choices for the fourth book, 2 choices for the fifth book, and 1 choice for the last book. Multiplying these choices together gives us a total of 6! = 720 ways to arrange the books.\n\n## Step 3:  However, we need to account for the restriction that the math books cannot be next to each other. To do this, let's consider the math books as a single \"math unit\" and calculate the number of ways to arrange the 5 \"units\" (4 non-math books and 1 math unit) in a row. This can be calculated as 5!, giving us 120 possible arrangements.\n\n## Step 4:  Now, for each of these 120 arrangements, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the math books within the math unit. Since there are 2 math books, they can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways.\n\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the books without having the math books next to each other is obtained by multiplying the number of ways to arrange the 5 units (120) by the number of ways to arrange the math books within the math unit (2), giving us 120 * 2 = 240.\n\n## Step 6:  However, we initially overcounted the number of ways to arrange the math books. When we treated the 2 math books as a single unit, we did not account for the fact that they can be swapped within the unit, resulting in 2! = 2 extra arrangements for each of the 120 possible arrangements of the 5 units.\n\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the books without having the math books next to each other is 240 - 2*120 = 240 - 240 = 0 + 6*5*4 = 120.\n\n## Step 8:  So the final answer is 6 * 5 * 4 = 120.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{360}$"
