    "problem": "Three-fourths of the students in Mr. Shearer's class have brown hair and six-sevenths of his students are right-handed.  If Mr. Shearer's class has 28 students, what is the smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair?",
    "solution": "Mr. Shearer has $\\frac{3}{4}(28)=21$ students with brown hair and $\\frac{6}{7}(28)=24$ students who are right-handed.  Since there are $28-24=4$ left-handed students, at most 4 of the 21 brown-haired students are left-handed.  Therefore, at least $\\boxed{17}$ of them are right-handed.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair, we first need to understand the given information.\n## Step 2:  We know that $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the students in Mr. Shearer's class have brown hair, and $\\frac{6}{7}$ of his students are right-handed.\n## Step 3:  The total number of students in the class is 28, so we can use these fractions to calculate the minimum number of students that satisfy both conditions.\n## Step 4:  Let's start with the students who have brown hair. The total number of students with brown hair is $\\frac{3}{4} \\times 28 = 21$.\n## Step 5:  Similarly, the total number of right-handed students is $\\frac{6}{7} \\times 28 = 24$.\n## Step 6:  Now, we want to find the smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair.\n## Step 7:  The smallest number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair is the result of multiplying the total number of students by the fractions that represent the two conditions. We have $\\frac{3}{4}$ for brown hair and $\\frac{6}{7}$ for being right-handed.\n## Step 8:  However, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which are 4 and 7. The LCM of 4 and 7 is 28.\n## Step 9:  To find the smallest possible number of students that satisfy both conditions, we can multiply the fractions representing the two conditions by the LCM, which is 28.\n## Step 10:  So, $\\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{6}{7} \\times 28 = 18$. Thus, the smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair is 18.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$"
