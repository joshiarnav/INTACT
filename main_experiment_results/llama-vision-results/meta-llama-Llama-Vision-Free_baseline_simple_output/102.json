    "problem": "How many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3?",
    "solution": "We list out all the positive integers less than 100 with a units digit of 3:  3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93.  Of these, only 33, 63, and 93 are not prime.  Thus our answer is $\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are tasked with finding the number of prime numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.\n## Step 2:  To begin, we need to identify all the numbers less than 100 that have a units digit of 3.\n## Step 3:  These numbers are 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93.\n## Step 4:  We then need to determine which of these numbers are prime.\n## Step 5:  To do this, we'll go through each number and check if it is divisible by any integer greater than 1 and less than itself.\n## Step 6:  Starting with 3, we see that it is a prime number as it can only be divided by 1 and itself.\n## Step 7:  Moving on to 13, it is also a prime number as it is only divisible by 1 and itself.\n## Step 8:  Similarly, we find that 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83 are prime numbers.\n## Step 9:  However, 33, 63, and 93 are not prime numbers as they can be divided by 3.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3 are 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, totaling 7 prime numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
