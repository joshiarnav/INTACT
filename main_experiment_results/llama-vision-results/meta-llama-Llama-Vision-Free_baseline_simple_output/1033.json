    "problem": "My school's math club has 6 boys and 8 girls.  I need to select a team to send to the state math competition.  We want 6 people on the team.  In how many ways can I select the team to have more girls than boys?",
    "solution": "We do this problem with three cases.\n\nCase 1: 4 girls, 2 boys on the team.\n\nWith 4 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$ ways to pick the girls, and $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to pick the boys, for a total of $70 \\times 15 = 1050$.\n\nCase 2: 5 girls, 1 boy on the team.  With 5 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{5} = 56$ ways to pick the girls, and $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to pick the boy, for a total of $56 \\times 6 = 336$.\n\nCase 3: 6 girls on the team. With 6 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{6} = 28$ ways to pick the girls on the team.\n\nThis gives us a sum of $1050 + 336 + 28 = \\boxed{1414}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the composition of the team that satisfies the condition\nThe team must have more girls than boys, which means the possible compositions of the team are 5 girls and 1 boy, 4 girls and 2 boys, 3 girls and 3 boys is not more girls than boys, 2 girls and 4 boys is not more girls than boys, and 1 girl and 5 boys is not more girls than boys.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to select 5 girls and 1 boy\nThe number of ways to select 5 girls from 8 girls is C(8,5), and the number of ways to select 1 boy from 6 boys is C(6,1). The total number of ways for this composition is C(8,5) * C(6,1).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to select 4 girls and 2 boys\nThe number of ways to select 4 girls from 8 girls is C(8,4), and the number of ways to select 2 boys from 6 boys is C(6,2). The total number of ways for this composition is C(8,4) * C(6,2).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to select 3 girls and 3 boys\nThe number of ways to select 3 girls from 8 girls is C(8,3), and the number of ways to select 3 boys from 6 boys is C(6,3). The total number of ways for this composition is C(8,3) * C(6,3).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways for each composition\nC(8,5) = 56, C(6,1) = 6, so 56 * 6 = 336.\nC(8,4) = 70, C(6,2) = 15, so 70 * 15 = 1050.\nC(8,3) = 56, C(6,3) = 20, so 56 * 20 = 1120.\n\n## Step 6: Add the number of ways for all compositions\nThe total number of ways is 336 + 1050 + 1120.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total number of ways\n336 + 1050 + 1120 = 2506.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2506}$"
