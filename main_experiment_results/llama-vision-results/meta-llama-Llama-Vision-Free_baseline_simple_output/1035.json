    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider all possible combinations of 1's, 2's, and 4's that sum up to 9 and then determine the number of distinguishable ways to arrange these combinations.\n## Step 2:  We can start by considering the number of 4's in the arrangement. If there are 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 4's, we can work out the possible combinations that sum up to 9.\n## Step 3:  For 0 4's, the sum can be obtained with 9 1's. However, this is not possible since we do not have 9 1's.\n## Step 4:  For 1 4, we have 5 left to sum up to 9, which can be done with 2 2's and 1 1, or 5 1's. This gives us 2 possibilities.\n## Step 5:  For 2 4's, we have 3 left to sum up to 9, which can be done with 1 2 and 1 1, 3 1's, or 1 1 and 1 1 1, resulting in 3 possibilities.\n## Step 6:  For 3 4's, we have 1 left to sum up to 9, which can be done with 1 2 and 1 1, or 1 1 and 1 1 1 is not valid, or 1 1. This gives us 2 possibilities.\n## Step 7:  For 4 4's, we have 1 left to sum up to 9, which can be done with 1 2 and 1 1, or 1 1 and 1 1 1 is not valid, or 1 1. This gives us 1 possibility.\n## Step 8:  To find the total number of distinguishable arrangements, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the 1's, 2's, and 4's for each combination.\n## Step 9:  For 1 4, 2 2's, and 1 1, there are 3! ways to arrange them.\n## Step 10:  For 1 4, 5 1's, there are 6! ways to arrange them.\n## Step 11:  For 2 4's, 1 2, and 1 1, there are 3! ways to arrange them.\n## Step 12:  For 2 4's, 3 1's, there are 5! ways to arrange them.\n## Step 13:  For 2 4's, 1 1, and 1 1, there are 3! ways to arrange them.\n## Step 14:  For 3 4's, 1 2, and 1 1, there are 4! ways to arrange them.\n## Step 15:  For 3 4's, 1 1, and 1 1, there are 4! ways to arrange them.\n## Step 16:  For 4 4's, 1 2, and 1 1, there are 3! ways to arrange them.\n## Step 17:  To find the total number of distinguishable arrangements, we need to multiply the number of ways to arrange the numbers for each combination and then sum up the results.\n## Step 18:  Therefore, the total number of distinguishable ways to write 9 as the sum of 1's, 2's, and 4's is 2*3! + 6*6! + 3*3! + 5*5! + 3*3! + 4*4! + 4*4! + 3*3! = 2*6 + 6*720 + 3*6 + 5*120 + 3*6 + 24*24 + 24*24 + 3*6 = 12 + 4320 + 18 + 600 + 18 + 576 + 576 + 18 = 4548.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4548}$"
