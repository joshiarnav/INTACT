    "problem": "The digits 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 will be put in random order to make a positive five-digit integer. What is the probability that the resulting integer will be divisible by 11? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "If the resulting integer is divisible by 11 then the sum of the first, third, and fifth digits has the same remainder when divided by 11 as the sum of the second and fourth digits. This only occurs when the first, third, and fifth digits are 2, 3, and 7 (in some order) and the second and fourth digits are 4 and 8 (in some order).\n\nThere are $\\binom{5}{2}$ total ways to partition these five digits into a group of 3 and a group of 2. From above, only one of these partitions will result in five-digit integers that are divisible by 11. Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the divisibility rule for 11, which states that a number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11.\n## Step 2:  Given the digits 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, we need to determine the possible arrangements that result in a positive five-digit integer divisible by 11.\n## Step 3:  We know that the alternating sum of the digits is $2-3+4-7+8=-4$, and for the number to be divisible by 11, the alternating sum must equal 0 or a multiple of 11.\n## Step 4:  However, we see that we cannot achieve an alternating sum of 0 or a multiple of 11 with the given set of digits.\n## Step 5:  Since the alternating sum of the given digits is either $-4$ or $-4+11=7$, we need to find the number of ways we can arrange the digits to obtain these sums.\n## Step 6:  We can achieve an alternating sum of $-4$ in two ways: either with the order $2-3+4-7+8$ or with the order $8-7+4-3+2$.\n## Step 7:  Similarly, we can achieve an alternating sum of $7$ in two ways: either with the order $2-3+4+8-7$ or with the order $8-7+4+3-2$.\n## Step 8:  This gives us a total of $2+2=4$ possible arrangements that result in a number divisible by 11.\n## Step 9:  Since the total number of possible arrangements for the 5 digits is $5!$, we can calculate the probability by taking the ratio of the number of desired outcomes to the total number of outcomes.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{4}{5!} = \\frac{4}{120} = \\frac{1}{30}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{30}}$"
