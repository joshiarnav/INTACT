    "problem": "For how many three-element sets (order doesn't matter) of positive integers $\\{a,b,c\\}$ is it true that $a\\times b\\times c=2310$?  (The positive integers $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are distinct.)",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $2310$ is $2310 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11.$ Therefore, we have the equation \\[ abc = 2310 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11,\\]where $a, b, c$ must be distinct positive integers and order does not matter. There are $3$ ways to assign each prime number on the right-hand side to one of the variables $a, b, c,$ which gives $3^5 = 243$ solutions for $(a, b, c).$ However, three of these solutions have two $1$s and one $2310,$ which contradicts the fact that $a, b, c$ must be distinct. Because each prime factor appears only once, all other solutions have $a, b, c$ distinct. Correcting for this, we get $243 - 3 = 240$ ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ where $a, b, c$ are all distinct.\n\nFinally, since order does not matter, we must divide by $3!,$ the number of ways to order $a, b, c.$ This gives the final answer, \\[\\frac{240}{3!} = \\frac{240}{6} = \\boxed{40}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to factorize the number 2310 into its prime factors to understand the possible combinations of its divisors.\n## Step 2:  The prime factorization of 2310 is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11$.\n## Step 3:  The next step is to determine the number of ways we can form a three-element set from this prime factorization, ensuring that the order doesn't matter and the numbers are distinct.\n## Step 4:  We can form such a set by selecting a combination of the prime factors $2, 3, 5, 7, 11$ to create the numbers $a, b, c$.\n## Step 5:  We can form a set with one of those numbers, and the other two numbers are the other prime factors. For example, we can have $\\{2, 3, 5\\cdot 7\\cdot 11\\}$.\n## Step 6:  We can also form a set with two of the numbers, and the other number is the product of the remaining prime factors. For example, we can have $\\{2\\cdot 3, 5\\cdot 7\\cdot 11\\}$.\n## Step 7:  Alternatively, we can have $\\{2\\cdot 5, 3\\cdot 7\\cdot 11\\}$.\n## Step 8:  Finally, we can have $\\{2\\cdot 7, 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 11\\}$.\n## Step 9:  We can also have $\\{2\\cdot 11, 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7\\}$.\n## Step 10:  Or, we can have $\\{3\\cdot 5, 2\\cdot 7\\cdot 11\\}$.\n## Step 11:  And finally, we can have $\\{3\\cdot 7, 2\\cdot 5\\cdot 11\\}$.\n## Step 12:  Now, we can also form a set with three of the numbers, and the other number is 1.\n## Step 13:  For example, we can have $\\{2\\cdot 3, 5\\cdot 7, 11\\}$.\n## Step 14:  We can also have $\\{2\\cdot 5, 3\\cdot 7, 11\\}$.\n## Step 15:  Alternatively, we can have $\\{2\\cdot 7, 3\\cdot 5, 11\\}$.\n## Step 16:  Finally, we can have $\\{2\\cdot 11, 3\\cdot 5, 7\\}$.\n## Step 17:  We can also have $\\{3\\cdot 7, 2\\cdot 5, 11\\}$.\n## Step 18:  Or, we can have $\\{3\\cdot 11, 2\\cdot 5, 7\\}$.\n## Step 19:  And finally, we can have $\\{5\\cdot 7, 2\\cdot 3, 11\\}$.\n## Step 20:  We can also have $\\{5\\cdot 11, 2\\cdot 3, 7\\}$.\n## Step 21:  Alternatively, we can have $\\{7\\cdot 11, 2\\cdot 3, 5\\}$.\n## Step 22:  Now, we need to count all these combinations to determine the total number of three-element sets that satisfy the given condition.\n## Step 23:  After listing all the combinations, we find that there are a total of $8$ sets that can be formed from the prime factors of 2310.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
