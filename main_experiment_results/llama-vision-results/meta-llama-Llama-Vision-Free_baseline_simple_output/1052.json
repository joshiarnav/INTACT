    "problem": "A senate committee has 5 Republicans and 4 Democrats.  In how many ways can the committee members sit in a row of 9 chairs, such that all 4 Democrats sit together?",
    "solution": "If we consider the group of Democrats as one person, then there are $6!$ ways to arrange the 6 people (the 5 Republicans and the one Democrat group). Then there are $4!$ ways to arrange arranging the 4 Democrats within their group.  So the number of arrangements is $6! \\times 4! = \\boxed{17,\\!280}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the seating arrangement and the constraints given.\n## Step 2:  We have a total of 9 chairs for the committee members, with 5 Republicans and 4 Democrats.\n## Step 3:  The condition specified is that all 4 Democrats must sit together.\n## Step 4:  To approach this, we can consider the 4 Democrats as a single entity or a \"block.\" This block, along with the 5 Republicans, forms 6 entities that need to be arranged in the 9 chairs.\n## Step 5:  The 6 entities (5 Republicans + 1 block of Democrats) can be arranged in $6!$ ways.\n## Step 6:  However, within the block of Democrats, the 4 Democrats can also be rearranged among themselves, which can be done in $4!$ ways.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the committee members such that all 4 Democrats sit together is $6! \\times 4!$.\n## Step 8:  Calculating this, we get $6! \\times 4! = 720 \\times 24 = 17280$.\n## Step 9:  Hence, the committee members can sit in a row of 9 chairs with all 4 Democrats sitting together in 17280 different ways.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17280}$"
