    "model_solution": "## Step 1: The formula for combinations is given by $\\dbinom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n!$ denotes the factorial of $n$. We need to apply this formula to compute $\\dbinom{8}{6}$.\n\n## Step 2: To apply the formula, we will first calculate the factorial of $8$, which is denoted as $8!$. $8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$.\n\n## Step 3: Next, we need to calculate the factorial of $6$, which is denoted as $6!$. $6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$.\n\n## Step 4: We also need to calculate the factorial of $8-6=2$, which is denoted as $2!$. $2! = 2 \\times 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Now, we can use the values we calculated to compute $\\dbinom{8}{6} = \\frac{8!}{6!(8-6)!} = \\frac{8!}{6!2!}$.\n\n## Step 6: Substituting the values we found in steps 2-4 into the equation, we get $\\dbinom{8}{6} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1)(2 \\times 1)}$.\n\n## Step 7: We can simplify the fraction by cancelling out the common terms in the numerator and the denominator, which are $6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$.\n\n## Step 8: After cancelling out the common terms, we are left with $\\dbinom{8}{6} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1}$.\n\n## Step 9: Finally, we can simplify the fraction further to find the value of $\\dbinom{8}{6}$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplifying the fraction gives us $\\dbinom{8}{6} = 4 \\times 7 = 28$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28}$"
