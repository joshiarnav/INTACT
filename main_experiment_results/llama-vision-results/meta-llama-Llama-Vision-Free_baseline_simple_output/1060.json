    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks us to determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ELLIPSE.\n## Step 2:  To solve this, we first need to understand the concept of permutations, which is used for arranging objects in a specific order.\n## Step 3:  We start by calculating the total number of arrangements for all the letters in the word ELLIPSE, if all the letters were distinct.\n## Step 4:  The word ELLIPSE has 7 letters, so if all the letters were distinct, there would be $7!$ ways to arrange them.\n## Step 5:  However, we need to account for the fact that some of the letters in the word are repeated.\n## Step 6:  The letters L and I are each repeated twice, and E is repeated twice as well.\n## Step 7:  To correct for overcounting due to these repeated letters, we divide the total number of arrangements by the factorial of the number of times each letter is repeated.\n## Step 8:  So, we divide $7!$ by $2!$ to account for the repeated Ls, then again by $2!$ to account for the repeated Is, and finally by $2!$ to account for the repeated Es.\n## Step 9:  This gives us $\\dfrac{7!}{2!\\times 2! \\times 2!}$ ways to arrange the letters of the word ELLIPSE.\n## Step 10:  We can simplify this expression by calculating the factorial of 7 and the factorials of 2, and then performing the division.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ELLIPSE is $\\dfrac{7!}{2!\\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{1260}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1260}$"
