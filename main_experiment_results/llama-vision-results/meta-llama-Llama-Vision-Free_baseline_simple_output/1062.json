    "problem": "A turn consists of rolling a standard die and tossing a fair coin. The game is won when the die shows a 1 or a 6 and the coin shows heads. What is the probability the game will be won before the fourth turn? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability of rolling 1 or 6 is $\\frac{2}{6}$, and the probability of flipping heads is $\\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, the probability that the game will end on the first turn is $\\frac{2}{6}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{6}$.  The probability that the game will not end on the first turn is $1-\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{5}{6}$.  Given that the game is still going after 1 turn, the probability that the game will not end on the second turn is also $\\frac{5}{6}$.  Therefore, the probability that the game does not end by the end of the second turn is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2$.  Similarly, the probability that the game is still going after 3 turns is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^3=\\frac{125}{216}$.  So the probability that the game is over by the end of the third turn is $1-\\dfrac{125}{216}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{91}{216}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of outcomes for one turn.\nFor one turn, the die has 6 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), and the coin has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails). So, the total number of outcomes for one turn is 6 * 2 = 12.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of winning on the first turn.\nThe game is won when the die shows a 1 or a 6 and the coin shows heads. So, the probability of winning on the first turn is (1/6) for the die to show a 1 or 6 multiplied by (1/2) for the coin to show heads, which is (1/6) * (1/2) = 1/12.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of winning on the second turn.\nThe probability of not winning on the first turn is 1 - (1/12) = 11/12. For the second turn, the probability of winning is the same as the first turn, which is (1/12).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of winning on the third turn.\nThe probability of not winning on the first two turns is (11/12) * (11/12). For the third turn, the probability of winning is (1/12).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of winning on the fourth turn.\nThe probability of not winning on the first three turns is ((11/12) * (11/12)) * (11/12). For the fourth turn, the probability of winning is (1/12).\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total probability of winning before the fourth turn.\nThe total probability of winning before the fourth turn is the sum of the probabilities of winning on the first, second, and third turns. This is (1/12) + ((11/12) * (1/12)) + (((11/12) * (11/12)) * (1/12)).\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression for the total probability.\nWe can simplify the expression (1/12) + ((11/12) * (1/12)) + (((11/12) * (11/12)) * (1/12)) by calculating the values of each term and then adding them together: (1/12) + (11/144) + (121/3456).\n\n## Step 8: Perform the addition to find the total probability.\nTo add the fractions (1/12) + (11/144) + (121/3456), we need to find a common denominator, which is 3456. Convert each fraction to have this common denominator: (288/3456) + (242/3456) + (121/3456).\n\n## Step 9: Add the fractions together.\n(288/3456) + (242/3456) + (121/3456) = (651/3456).\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the fraction if necessary.\nThe fraction (651/3456) cannot be simplified further.\n\n## Step 11: Convert the improper fraction to a common fraction.\nWe can convert the improper fraction (651/3456) to a common fraction by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 651/3456 = 0.1882 (approximately), but we need to express it as a simplified common fraction.\n\n## Step 12: Realize that steps 10 and 11 are not required.\nSince 651 and 3456 can be divided by their greatest common divisor, which is 3, we can simplify the fraction.\n\n## Step 13: Simplify the fraction.\nDivide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, 3. This gives us (651/3)/(3456/3) = 217/1152.\n\n## Step 14: Further simplify the fraction if possible.\n217 and 1152 have a greatest common divisor of 1, so the fraction (217/1152) cannot be simplified further.\n\n## Step 15: Express the final probability as a simplified fraction.\nThe final probability of winning before the fourth turn is (217/1152).\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{217}{1152}}$"
