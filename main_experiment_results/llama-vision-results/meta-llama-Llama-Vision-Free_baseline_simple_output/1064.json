    "problem": "If two distinct members of the set $\\{ 2, 4, 12, 14, 21, 28, 98 \\}$ are randomly selected and multiplied, what is the probability that the product is a multiple of 196? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Since a multiple of 196 must have 2 factors of 2 and 2 factors of 7, we can count the pairs by focusing on the factors of 7. For one thing, 98 can be paired with any even number as it has 1 factor of 2, since $98=2 \\cdot 7^2$ takes care of all the other primes. So, 98 can be paired with 2, 4, 12, 14, and 28, for 5 pairs. Then, 28 can be paired with (excluding 98 which we already counted) 21 and 14, both of which have the necessary factor of 7, giving us 2 more pairs. There are no remaining pairs of numbers 21 and smaller that are multiples of 196, because the only pair with two factors of 7, $\\{14, 21 \\}$, has a factor of 2 but not 4. So, there are $5+2=7$ pairs. And in total, there are ${7 \\choose 2 } =21$ possible pairs, giving us a probability of $\\frac{7}{21} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are given a set of numbers: $\\{ 2, 4, 12, 14, 21, 28, 98 \\}$. We need to find the probability that the product of two distinct members of this set is a multiple of 196.\n## Step 2:  To find the pairs of numbers that multiply to give a multiple of 196, we need to consider the prime factorization of 196, which is $2^2\\cdot 7^2$.\n## Step 3:  From the set, we can observe that the numbers $14$, $28$, and $98$ are multiples of 4, but only $98$ is a multiple of 196. Therefore, any pair that includes 98 as one of its members will be a multiple of 196, as $98 = 2\\cdot 7^2$.\n## Step 4:  Additionally, we need to consider pairs of numbers that are multiples of both 4 and 7, as their product will have a factor of 196.\n## Step 5:  Upon examining the set, we find that the numbers 4 and 28 are the only other pair that multiplies to give a multiple of 196.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the pairs that give a multiple of 196 are $\\{14,98\\}$, $\\{28,98\\}$, $\\{4,98\\}$, and $\\{4,28\\}$, and $\\{28,14\\}$.\n## Step 7:  The total number of ways to choose two numbers from the set is given by ${7 \\choose 2} = 21$.\n## Step 8:  We have found 5 successful pairs that multiply to give a multiple of 196.\n## Step 9:  This means the probability of selecting a pair of numbers whose product is a multiple of 196 is $\\frac{5}{21}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{21}}$"
