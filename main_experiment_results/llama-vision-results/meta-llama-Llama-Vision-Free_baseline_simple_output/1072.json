    "problem": "Two cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that they are either both hearts or both diamonds?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{52}{2}=\\frac{52\\cdot 51}{2}=26\\cdot 51$ ways to choose two cards from a 52-card deck. There are $\\binom{13}{2}=\\frac{13\\cdot 12}{2}$ ways to choose two cards which are both hearts, and the same number of ways to choose two cards which are both diamonds. Therefore, the probability of choosing two cards which are both hearts or both diamonds is $\\frac{13 \\cdot 12}{26 \\cdot 51}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{17}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 cards from a 52-card deck.\nThe total number of ways to choose 2 cards from a 52-card deck is given by the combination formula $C(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $r$ is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial. So, the total number of ways to choose 2 cards from 52 is $C(52, 2) = \\frac{52!}{2!(52-2)!} = \\frac{52*51}{2} = 1326$.\n\n## Step 2:  Determine the number of ways to choose 2 hearts.\nThere are 13 hearts in a standard 52-card deck. Using the combination formula, the number of ways to choose 2 hearts is $C(13, 2) = \\frac{13!}{2!(13-2)!} = \\frac{13*12}{2} = 78$.\n\n## Step 3:  Determine the number of ways to choose 2 diamonds.\nSimilar to the hearts, there are 13 diamonds in a standard 52-card deck. Using the combination formula, the number of ways to choose 2 diamonds is also $C(13, 2) = 78$.\n\n## Step 4:  Calculate the total number of favorable outcomes.\nThe total number of favorable outcomes (both hearts or both diamonds) is the sum of the number of ways to choose 2 hearts and the number of ways to choose 2 diamonds. So, the total number of favorable outcomes is $78 + 78 = 156$.\n\n## Step 5:  Calculate the probability of choosing either both hearts or both diamonds.\nThe probability of choosing either both hearts or both diamonds is the total number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of ways to choose 2 cards. So, the probability is $\\frac{156}{1326}$.\n\n## Step 6:  Simplify the fraction to find the final probability.\nTo simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6. Thus, the simplified probability is $\\frac{156}{1326} = \\frac{26}{221}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{26}{221}}$"
