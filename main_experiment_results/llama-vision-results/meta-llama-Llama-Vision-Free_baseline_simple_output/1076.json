    "problem": "How many perfect squares have a value between 10 and 1000?",
    "solution": "We can see that $3^2 = 9 < 10 < 4^2 = 16$. Thus, $4^2 = 16$ is the smallest perfect square between 10 and 1000.\n\nWe also see that $31^2 = 961 < 1000 < 32^2 = 1024$. Thus, $31^2 = 961$ is the greatest perfect square between 10 and 1000.\n\nIt follows that there are $31 - 4 + 1 = \\boxed{28}$ perfect squares between 10 and 1000.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are tasked with finding the number of perfect squares that have a value between 10 and 1000.\n## Step 2:  To begin, we need to identify the smallest perfect square that is greater than 10. This will give us the starting point for our search.\n## Step 3:  The smallest perfect square greater than 10 is 16, which is the square of 4. Therefore, the first perfect square we need to consider is $4^2 = 16$.\n## Step 4:  Next, we need to determine the largest perfect square that is less than 1000. This will give us the end point for our search.\n## Step 5:  The largest perfect square less than 1000 is 31, which is the square of 31. Therefore, the last perfect square we need to consider is $31^2 = 961$.\n## Step 6:  Now that we have identified the range of perfect squares we need to consider, we can count the number of perfect squares in this range.\n## Step 7:  The perfect squares in this range are $4^2, 5^2, 6^2, \\ldots, 31^2$.\n## Step 8:  We can count the number of perfect squares by subtracting the square of the starting number from the square of the ending number, and then adding 1 to include the starting point.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the number of perfect squares between 10 and 1000 is $31 - 4 + 1 = 28$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28}$"
