    "problem": "A street has 50 houses on each side, for a total of 100 houses. The addresses on the south side of the street form an arithmetic sequence, as do the addresses on the north side of the street. On the south side, the addresses are 1, 5, 9, etc., and on the north side they are 3, 7, 11, etc. A sign painter paints house numbers on a house for $\\$1$ per digit. If he paints the appropriate house number once on each of these 100 houses, how much does he earn?",
    "solution": "If we combine the house numbers on the north and south sides, we get exactly the odd positive integers. The $100^{\\text{th}}$ odd integer is 199, so we divide the first 100 odd integers into three groups: \\[\\{1, 3,\\ldots, 9\\},\\qquad\\{11, 13, \\ldots, 99\\},\\qquad\\{101, 103, \\ldots, 199\\}\\] There are five numbers with one digit, 45 numbers with two digits, and 50 numbers with three digits. Thus, the total revenue is $1\\times5 + 2\\times 45 + 3\\times 50 = \\boxed{245}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the address sequences for both the south and north sides of the street.\nThe south side sequence starts with 1 and increases by 4 each time, resulting in the sequence 1, 5, 9, ..., 49. The north side sequence starts with 3 and increases by 4 each time, resulting in the sequence 3, 7, 11, ..., 101.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the number of digits in the addresses on the south side of the street.\nWe need to count the number of digits in each address on the south side. Since the addresses are in the sequence 1, 5, 9, ..., 49, we can count the number of addresses with 1 digit, 2 digits, and 3 digits. The sequence 1, 5, 9, ..., 49 has 13 addresses with 1 digit, 13 addresses with 2 digits, and 24 addresses with 3 digits.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for painting house numbers on the south side of the street.\nThe sign painter earns $1 per digit. So, for the south side, he earns $13 * $1 + $13 * $2 + $24 * $3.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the number of digits in the addresses on the north side of the street.\nWe need to count the number of digits in each address on the north side. Since the addresses are in the sequence 3, 7, 11, ..., 101, we can count the number of addresses with 1 digit, 2 digits, and 3 digits. The sequence 3, 7, 11, ..., 101 has 0 addresses with 1 digit, 25 addresses with 2 digits, and 25 addresses with 3 digits.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total earnings for painting house numbers on the north side of the street.\nThe sign painter earns $1 per digit. So, for the north side, he earns $0 * $1 + $25 * $2 + $25 * $3.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total earnings for painting house numbers on both the south and north sides of the street.\nTo find the total earnings, we need to add the earnings from both the south and north sides. Total earnings = ($13 * $1 + $13 * $2 + $24 * $3) + ($0 * $1 + $25 * $2 + $25 * $3).\n\n## Step 7: Perform the calculations to find the total earnings.\nTotal earnings = ($13 * $1 + $13 * $2 + $24 * $3) + ($0 * $1 + $25 * $2 + $25 * $3) = ($13 + $26 + $72) + ($0 + $50 + $75) = $111 + $125.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the sum.\n$111 + $125 = $236.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{236}$"
