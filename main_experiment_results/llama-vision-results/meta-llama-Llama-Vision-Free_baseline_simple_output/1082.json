    "problem": "A restaurant offers three desserts, and exactly twice as many appetizers as main courses. A dinner consists of an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert. What is the least number of main courses that the restaurant should offer so that a customer could have a different dinner each night in the year 2003?",
    "solution": "Let $m$ denote the number of main courses needed to meet the requirement. Then the number of dinners available is $3\\cdot m \\cdot 2m = 6m^2$.  Thus $m^2$ must be at least $365/6 \\approx 61$.  Since $7^2 = 49<61<64 = 8^2$, $\\boxed{8}$ main courses is enough, but 7 is not.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem requires us to find the least number of main courses that a restaurant should offer so that each customer could have a different dinner each night in the year 2003. To start, we need to understand the relationship between the number of appetizers, main courses, and desserts.\n## Step 2:  We know that the restaurant offers three desserts. Additionally, they offer exactly twice as many appetizers as main courses. This implies that if the number of main courses is denoted by $m$, then the number of appetizers will be $2m$.\n## Step 3:  Since a dinner consists of an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert, we need to find the least value of $m$ such that the total number of different dinners is greater than or equal to 365 (the number of days in the year 2003).\n## Step 4:  To calculate the total number of different dinners, we need to find the product of the number of options for each course, which is $3 \\times 2m \\times m = 6m^2$.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, we must solve the inequality $6m^2 \\ge 365$ to determine the minimum value of $m$ that satisfies this condition.\n## Step 6:  Dividing both sides of the inequality by $6$, we obtain $m^2 \\ge \\frac{365}{6}$.\n## Step 7:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $m \\ge \\sqrt{\\frac{365}{6}}$.\n## Step 8:  Upon calculating the square root, we find that $m \\ge 6.42$.\n## Step 9:  Since we can't have a fraction of a main course, the least integer greater than $6.42$ is $7$. Therefore, the restaurant should offer at least $7$ main courses to ensure that each customer could have a different dinner each night in the year 2003.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
