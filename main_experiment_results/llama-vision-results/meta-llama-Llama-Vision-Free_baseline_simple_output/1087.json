    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem involves a European train compartment with six seats, four of which are broken. Wilhelm needs to randomly select four seats to indicate that they are broken on a maintenance report form. We need to find the probability that Wilhelm marks the correct broken seats.\n## Step 2:  Since there are four broken seats, Wilhelm has a total of $\\binom{4}{4}=1$ way to choose all four broken seats correctly.\n## Step 3:  However, he also has $\\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways to choose three of the four broken seats correctly but mark one of the two working seats as broken. Similarly, he has $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose two of the four broken seats correctly but mark the other two working seats as broken.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, Wilhelm has a total of $1+4+6=11$ ways to incorrectly mark the seats.\n## Step 5:  Hence, the probability that Wilhelm marks the correct seats is $\\frac{1}{11}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{11}}$"
