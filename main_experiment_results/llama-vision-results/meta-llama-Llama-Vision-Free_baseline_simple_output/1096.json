    "problem": "When Trilisa takes pictures, they turn out with probability $\\frac{1}{5}$. She wants to take enough pictures so that the probability of at least one turning out is at least $\\frac{3}{4}$. How few pictures can she take to accomplish this?",
    "solution": "The probability that at least one picture turns out is $1$ minus the probability that all the pictures do not turn out.  Since the probability that one picture will not turn out is $\\frac{4}{5}$, the probability that $n$ pictures all do not turn out is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n$.  So we want\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n<\\frac{1}{4}\\Rightarrow 4^{n+1}<5^n$$\n\nWe see that $4^7>5^6$, but $4^8<5^7$.  Thus the smallest allowable value of $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",

We want to find the smallest n such that $1 - \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n \\geq \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the inequality\n$1 - \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n \\geq \\frac{3}{4}$\n$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n \\leq \\frac{1}{4}$\nWe can use the inequality $(0.8)^5 < 0.4$ to find a range of n that satisfies the inequality.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for n\n$(0.8)^5 < 0.4$ and $(0.8)^4 > 0.4$, so we know that $5 < n < 4$ is not true. However, we can see that $(0.8)^6 > 0.4$ and $(0.8)^7 < 0.4$. We can then try values of n to see which one satisfies the inequality.\n\n## Step 7: Test n = 4\n$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = 0.4096$, which is not less than or equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 8: Test n = 5\n$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^5 = 0.32768$, which is not less than or equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 9: Test n = 6\n$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^6 = 0.262144$, which is not less than or equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 10: Test n = 7\n$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^7 = 0.2097152$, which is not less than or equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 11: Test n = 8\n$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^8 = 0.16777216$, which is not less than or equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 12: Test n = 9\n$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^9 = 0.134217728$, which is not less than or equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 13: Test n = 10\n$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{10} = 0.1073741824$, which is not less than or equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 14: Test n = 11\n$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{11} = 0.0859375$, which is less than or equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 15: The smallest n that satisfies the inequality\nWe can conclude that the smallest value of n that satisfies the inequality is 11.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$"
