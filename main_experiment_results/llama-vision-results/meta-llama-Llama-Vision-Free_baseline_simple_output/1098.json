    "problem": "Three different one-digit positive integers are placed in the bottom row of cells. Numbers in adjacent cells are added and the sum is placed in the cell above them. In the second row, continue the same process to obtain a number in the top cell. What is the difference between the largest and smallest numbers possible in the top cell?

    "solution": "If the lower cells contain $A$, $B$ and $C$, then the second row will contain $A + B$ and $B + C$, and the top cell will contain $A + 2B+C$. To obtain the smallest sum, place 1  in the center cell and 2 and 3 in the outer ones. The top number will be 7. For the largest sum, place 9 in the center cell and 7 and 8 in the outer ones. This top number will be 33. The difference is $33-7=\\boxed{26}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the largest and smallest numbers possible in the top cell, we need to determine the possible values that can be placed in the top cell based on the numbers in the bottom row.\n## Step 2:  Let's represent the numbers in the bottom row as $a$, $b$, and $c$ from left to right. Then the numbers in the second row will be $a+b$, $b+c$, and $a+c$ from left to right.\n## Step 3:  Moving to the top cell, we get the sum of the second row, which is $(a+b) + (b+c) + (a+c) = 2a + 2b + 2c = 2(a + b + c)$.\n## Step 4:  This indicates that the sum of the numbers in the bottom row has a direct relationship with the number in the top cell. Therefore, to maximize the number in the top cell, we need to maximize the sum of the numbers in the bottom row.\n## Step 5:  The largest possible one-digit positive integers are 9, 8, and 7, so the largest possible sum is $9 + 8 + 7 = 24$. This results in the largest number in the top cell being $2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n## Step 6:  Conversely, to minimize the number in the top cell, we need to minimize the sum of the numbers in the bottom row. The smallest possible one-digit positive integers are 1, 2, and 3, so the smallest possible sum is $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$. This results in the smallest number in the top cell being $2 \\times 6 = 12$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the difference between the largest and smallest numbers possible in the top cell is $48 - 12 = 36$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$"
