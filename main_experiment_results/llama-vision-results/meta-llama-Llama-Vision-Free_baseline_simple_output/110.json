    "solution": "We consider the subset $\\{ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 \\}$ which consists only of the prime integers in the original set. Any subset consisting entirely of prime numbers must be a subset of this particular subset. And, there are $2^5 - 1 = \\boxed{31}$ non-empty subsets of this 5-element set, which we can easily see by making the choice of including or not including each element.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, we need to identify the prime numbers within the given set of numbers, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.\n## Step 2:  From the given set, the prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. These are the numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves, making them prime.\n## Step 3:  Next, we need to determine the number of non-empty subsets that can be formed using these prime numbers. A non-empty subset is any subset that contains at least one element.\n## Step 4:  To calculate the total number of subsets, including the empty set, we use the formula $2^n$, where $n$ is the total number of elements in the set. In this case, $n=5$, so the total number of subsets (including the empty set) is $2^5=32$.\n## Step 5:  However, we need to exclude the empty set from our count since we're looking for non-empty subsets. Therefore, the total number of non-empty subsets of prime numbers is $32-1=31$.\n## Step 6:  So, the number of non-empty subsets consisting entirely of prime numbers is $31$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{31}$"
