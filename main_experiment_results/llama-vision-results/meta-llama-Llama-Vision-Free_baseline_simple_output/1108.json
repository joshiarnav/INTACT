    "solution": "We may assume that one of the triangles is attached to side $\\overline{AB}$. The second triangle can be attached to $\\overline{BC}$ or $\\overline{CD}$ to obtain two non-congruent figures. If the second triangle is attached to $\\overline{AE}$ or to $\\overline{DE}$, the figure can be reflected about the vertical axis of symmetry of the pentagon to obtain one of the two already counted. Thus the total is $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks for the number of non-congruent figures that can be constructed by attaching two equilateral triangles to the regular pentagon $ABCDE$ in two of the five shown positions.\n## Step 2:  We are given a regular pentagon and we need to determine the number of non-congruent figures we can form by attaching two equilateral triangles in different positions.\n## Step 3:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the possible positions of the first equilateral triangle. Since there are 5 vertices in the pentagon, there are 5 different positions where the first triangle can be attached.\n## Step 4:  Once the first triangle is attached, we need to consider the possible positions of the second triangle. The second triangle cannot be attached to the same vertex or edge that the first triangle is attached to. This means the second triangle has 3 remaining positions to be attached.\n## Step 5:  However, we need to account for the cases where the two triangles are congruent. When the triangles are the same, the order of attachment does not matter, and the figure will be the same regardless of the order. So, for each pair of positions for the two triangles, we need to consider whether the triangles are the same or not.\n## Step 6:  There are 5 choices for the first position and 3 choices for the second position, resulting in $5 \\cdot 3 = 15$ possibilities if we do not consider the cases where the triangles are the same.\n## Step 7:  However, in 5 of these cases, the two triangles are the same, resulting in 10 cases with different triangles.\n## Step 8:  We also need to consider the cases where the triangles are rotated or reflected, which would result in the same figure.\n## Step 9:  After accounting for these cases, we find that there are $\\frac{10}{3}$ cases that result in the same figure. Therefore, in addition to the 10 cases with different triangles, there is 1 case that results in the same figure. Thus, we have a total of 12 non-congruent figures.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
