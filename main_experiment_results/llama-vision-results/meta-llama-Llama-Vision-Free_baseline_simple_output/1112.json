    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are given the equation $x + 2y = 100$, and we need to find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ that satisfy this equation.\n## Step 2:  To approach this, we can start by isolating one of the variables. Let's solve for $x$ in terms of $y$. This gives us $x = 100 - 2y$.\n## Step 3:  Now, we know that $x$ must be a positive integer, which means $100 - 2y > 0$. Simplifying this inequality, we get $2y < 100$, which further simplifies to $y < 50$.\n## Step 4:  Since $y$ is a positive integer, the possible values for $y$ are $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 49$. This gives us a total of $49$ possible values for $y$.\n## Step 5:  For each value of $y$, we can calculate the corresponding value of $x$ using the equation $x = 100 - 2y$.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, for each of the $49$ values of $y$, we get a unique ordered pair $(x,y)$ that satisfies the equation $x+2y=100$.\n## Step 7:  Hence, the total number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ that satisfy the equation is $\\boxed{49}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{49}$"
