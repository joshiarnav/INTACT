    "problem": "The sequence 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, $\\ldots$ contains all the positive integers from least to greatest that are neither squares nor cubes nor perfect fifth powers (in the form of $x^{5}$, where $x$ is an integer). What is the $1000^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence?",
    "solution": "We see that it's easier to count the number of perfect squares, perfect cubes and perfect fifth powers less than $33^{2}=1089$. We see there are 32 perfect squares less than 1089, which are $1^2$, $2^2$, $\\ldots$, $32^2$ and then there are 10 perfect cubes which are $1^3$, $\\ldots$, $10^3$. There are 4 perfect fifth powers less than 1089 which are $1^5$, $\\ldots$, $4^5$. Then notice there are 3 numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes which are 1, $2^{6} = 64$ and $3^{6} = 729$. There are also 2 numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect fifth powers which are $1^{10} = 1$ and $2^{10} = 1024$. The only number which is both a perfect cube and a perfect fifth power is $1^{15}=1$. The only number which is a perfect square, perfect cube, and perfect fifth power all at the same time is $1^{30}=1$. So within the first 1089 positive integers we need to get rid of $32+10+4-3-2-1+1 =41$ integers which means the $1000^{\\text{th}}$ term is $1000+41 = \\boxed{1041}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the sequence and its restrictions\nThe sequence contains all positive integers that are neither squares, cubes, nor perfect fifth powers.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the perfect fifth powers in the sequence\nThe perfect fifth powers are $1^{5}=1$ (not in the sequence) and $2^{5}=32$, $3^{5}=243$, and $4^{5}=1024$. These need to be excluded.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the numbers less than $32$\nSince $32$ is the first perfect fifth power, we need to check which numbers less than $32$ are squares or cubes. These are $1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 25$. But we already know that the sequence contains $2, 3, 5, 6, 7$. Hence, we have to exclude $1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 25$.\n\n## Step 4: Count the excluded numbers and determine the number of terms to be excluded between 32 and 243\nWe have to exclude $1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 25$, which is $6$ numbers. Between $32$ and $243$, we have the perfect fifth powers $243$. We also have to exclude the perfect squares and cubes between $32$ and $243$. The perfect squares are $36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225$. The perfect cubes are $27, 64, 125$. We have to exclude the numbers that are counted twice, which are $64$ and $1$. Hence, the total number of terms to be excluded between $32$ and $243$ is $10+8-2+3=19$.\n\n## Step 5: Count the excluded numbers and determine the number of terms to be excluded between 243 and 1024\nWe have to exclude $243$, and the perfect squares and cubes between $243$ and $1024$. The perfect squares are $256, 289, 324, 361, 400, 441, 484, 529, 576, 625, 676, 729, 784, 841, 900, 961$. The perfect cubes are $279, 343, 512, 729$. We have to exclude the numbers that are counted twice, which are $1, 64, 729$. Hence, the total number of terms to be excluded between $243$ and $1024$ is $15+4-3=16$.\n\n## Step 6: Count the total number of excluded numbers and determine the 1000th term of the sequence\nWe have to exclude $6$ numbers less than $32$, $19$ numbers between $32$ and $243$, and $16$ numbers between $243$ and $1024$. Hence, the total number of terms to be excluded is $6+19+16=41$. Since the first $6$ terms of the sequence are $2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10$, the first $6+41=47$ terms of the sequence are $2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46$. The 1000th term of the sequence is the $1000-47+1=954$th term of the sequence $47, 47+19=66, 66+16=82, 82+1=83, 83+2=85, 85+3=88, 88+4=92, 92+5=97, 97+6=103, 103+7=110, 110+8=118, 118+9=127, 127+10=137, 137+11=148, 148+12=160, 160+13=173, 173+14=187, 187+15=202, 202+16=218, 218+17=235, 235+18=253, 253+19=272, 272+20=292, 292+21=313, 313+22=335, 335+23=358, 358+24=382, 382+25=407, 407+26=433, 433+27=460, 460+28=488, 488+29=517, 517+30=547, 547+31=578, 578+32=610, 610+33=643, 643+34=677, 677+35=712, 712+36=748, 748+37=785, 785+38=823, 823+39=862, 862+40=902, 902+41=943, 943+1=944$. However, we are looking for the 1000th term of the sequence. We need to continue the pattern and find the next number that is not a perfect square or perfect cube, which is the 1000th term of the sequence.\n\n## Step 7: Find the next number that is not a perfect square or perfect cube\nSince $944$ is the 943rd term of the sequence, we need to find the next number that is not a perfect square or perfect cube. We can start checking numbers greater than $944$ and see if they are perfect squares or perfect cubes. We find that $1024$ is a perfect sixth power, but not a perfect square, cube, or fifth power. Hence, the 1000th term of the sequence is $1024$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1024}$"
