    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the number of diagonals in a pentagonal prism, we need to break down the process into manageable steps.\n## Step 2:  First, we'll consider the pentagonal faces of the prism. Each vertex of the pentagonal face can be connected to every other vertex that is not adjacent to it, forming a diagonal. Since there are 5 vertices in a pentagon, each vertex can be connected to 2 other vertices, which is the number of diagonals emanating from that vertex. Therefore, the total number of diagonals emanating from the pentagonal faces is $5 \\cdot 2 = 10$.\n## Step 3:  However, we need to account for the fact that the 5 diagonals emanating from one vertex are also counted for the adjacent vertex. This means we have counted each diagonal twice, so we need to divide the total count by 2 to correct for the overcounting.\n## Step 4:  Moving on to the rectangular faces, we have 5 rectangles in a pentagonal prism. Each rectangle has 2 diagonals. So, the total number of diagonals emanating from the rectangular faces is $5 \\cdot 2 = 10$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we can calculate the total number of diagonals in the pentagonal prism by adding the diagonals from the pentagonal faces and the rectangular faces, which gives us $10 + 10 = 20$.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the total number of diagonals in the pentagonal prism is $\\boxed{20}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$"
