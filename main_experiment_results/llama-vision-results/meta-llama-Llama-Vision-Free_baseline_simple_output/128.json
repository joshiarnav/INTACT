    "problem": "Without looking at the labels, Adrien placed four CDs in four cases. What is the probability that exactly two of the CDs are in the wrong cases? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Given any pair of the 4 CDs, there is exactly one arrangement with only these two CDs in the correct cases, because each of the remaining two CDs must be in the case of the other one.  Therefore, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ arrangements of the CDs for which exactly two of the CDs are in the correct case.  The probability that one of these 6 arrangements will be chosen from among the $4!=24$ equally likely arrangements is $\\dfrac{6}{24}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the probability that exactly two of the CDs are in the wrong cases, we need to consider the total number of ways in which the CDs can be placed in the cases, and then determine the number of successful outcomes where exactly two CDs are in the wrong cases.\n## Step 2:  The total number of ways to arrange the CDs in the cases is given by $4!$, as there are $4$ options for the first case, $3$ options for the second case, $2$ options for the third case, and $1$ option for the last case.\n## Step 3:  Now, let's calculate the number of successful outcomes where exactly two CDs are in the wrong cases. We can approach this by choosing $2$ CDs out of the $4$ that will be misplaced, and then arranging these misplaced CDs along with the other $2$ CDs in the correct positions.\n## Step 4:  There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose the $2$ CDs that will be misplaced. This means we have $6$ combinations of misplaced CDs.\n## Step 5:  Once we have chosen the $2$ CDs to be misplaced, there is only one way to arrange these misplaced CDs along with the other $2$ CDs in the correct positions, as the misplaced CDs must be placed in the cases of the other $2$ CDs. Therefore, for each combination of misplaced CDs, there is exactly $1$ way to arrange them correctly.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the total number of successful outcomes where exactly two CDs are in the wrong cases is $6$.\n## Step 7:  To find the probability, we divide the number of successful outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes, giving us $\\frac{6}{24}=\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$"
