    "problem": "There are four red balls and two white balls in a jar. One ball is randomly removed and replaced with a ball of the opposite color. The jar is then shaken and one ball is randomly selected. What is the probability that this ball is red? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We split the problem into two cases.\n\nCase I: A red ball is removed. The probability that a red ball is removed is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$. After it is replaced by a white ball, the probability of drawing a red ball is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the probability that a red ball will be drawn in this case is $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nCase II: A white ball is removed. The probability that a white ball is removed is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$. After it is replaced by a red ball, the probability of drawing a red ball is $\\frac{5}{6}$. Thus, the probability that a red ball will be drawn in this case is $\\frac{5}{18}$.\n\nWe add the two probabilities for a total probability of $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{18}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the initial probability of drawing a red ball\nThere are four red balls and two white balls, making a total of six balls in the jar. The probability of drawing a red ball initially is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 4/6 or 2/3.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing a red ball after a red ball was added\nIf a red ball is added to the jar, the total number of balls becomes seven, with five red balls and two white balls. The probability of drawing a red ball in this case is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 5/7.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of drawing a red ball after a white ball was added\nIf a white ball is added to the jar, the total number of balls becomes seven, with four red balls and three white balls. The probability of drawing a red ball in this case is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, which is 4/7.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that the second ball drawn is red given that the first ball drawn is red\nTo calculate this, we multiply the probability of drawing a red ball first, which is 2/3, by the probability of drawing a red ball second after a red ball is added, which is 5/7.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that the second ball drawn is red given that the first ball drawn is white\nTo calculate this, we multiply the probability of drawing a white ball first, which is 2/3, by the probability of drawing a red ball second after a white ball is added, which is 4/7.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the overall probability that the second ball drawn is red\nTo get this, we add the results from step 4 and step 5. So, (2/3) * (5/7) + (1/3) * (4/7).\n\n## Step 7: Perform the arithmetic\nFirst, we multiply the fractions: (2/3) * (5/7) = 10/21 and (1/3) * (4/7) = 4/21.\n\n## Step 8: Add the fractions\nSince both fractions have a denominator of 21, we can directly add the numerators: 10/21 + 4/21 = 14/21.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the fraction\nThe fraction 14/21 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 7. This results in 2/3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$"
