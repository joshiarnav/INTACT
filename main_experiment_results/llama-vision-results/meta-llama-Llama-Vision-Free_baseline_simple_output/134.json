    "problem": "In how many ways can 8 people sit around a round table if 3 of the people -- Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas -- all want to sit together?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "First choose three consecutive seats for Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.  It doesn't matter which three consecutive seats that we choose, since any three such seats can be rotated to any other such seats.  Once the three seats are chosen, there are $3!$ ways to seat the three friends there.  The other five seats are for the other five people, so there are $5!$ ways to seat them there.  The answer is $3! \\times 5! = \\boxed{720}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Consider the constraints and requirements of the problem\nThe problem requires counting the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table with the condition that 3 specific people, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas, must sit together.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of ways to arrange the group of 3 people who want to sit together\nSince the three people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together, we can treat them as a single unit. This gives us 6 units in total (the group of 3 people and the 5 other individuals).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to arrange these 6 units around the round table\nThe number of ways to arrange 6 units in a circle is (6 - 1)!, because the rotations of the same arrangement are considered the same. So, we have 5! ways to arrange these units.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit\nWithin the unit of the three people who want to sit together, there are 3! ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the product rule to find the total number of arrangements\nTo find the total number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 units by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of arrangements\nTotal number of arrangements = (5!) * (3!) = 120 * 6 = 720.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{720}$"
