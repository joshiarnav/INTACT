    "problem": "The digits from 1 to 6 are arranged to form a six-digit multiple of 5. What is the probability that the number is greater than 500,000? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Of the digits 1 to 6, 5 must be the units digit since our number is a multiple of 5. We have five digits remaining, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, for five digit places. The number is greater than 500,000 if and only if the hundred thousands digit is 6. The probability that the hundred thousands digit (which can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6) is 6 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem requires arranging the digits 1 to 6 in a six-digit number that is a multiple of 5, and finding the probability that the number is greater than 500,000.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the total number of arrangements\nSince there are 6 digits and the order matters, the total number of arrangements can be calculated using the factorial function, which is 6!. This is because for the first digit, we have 6 choices, for the second digit we have 5 choices, and so on, resulting in 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720 possible arrangements.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the condition for a number to be greater than 500,000\nA six-digit number is greater than 500,000 if its first digit is greater than or equal to 5. Since we are only arranging the digits 1 to 6, we need to consider the arrangements where the first digit is 5 or 6.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of valid arrangements\nThe digits from 5 to 6 can be chosen as the first digit in 2 ways (either 5 or 6). After choosing the first digit, we have 5 remaining digits to arrange in any order, which can be done in 5! = 120 ways. Therefore, the total number of valid arrangements is 2 * 120 = 240.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability\nThe probability of a number being greater than 500,000 is the ratio of the number of valid arrangements to the total number of arrangements, which is 240/720.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the fraction\nWe can simplify the fraction 240/720 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 240. This results in 1/3.\n\n## Step 7: Express the answer as a common fraction\nThe probability that the number is greater than 500,000 is 1/3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$"
