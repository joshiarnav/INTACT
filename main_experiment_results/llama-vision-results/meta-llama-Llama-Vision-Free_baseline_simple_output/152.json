    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The given equation is a cubic equation that involves various operations, such as cubing, subtraction, and addition.\n## Step 2:  First, let's simplify the equation by evaluating the expression on the right-hand side. The expression $25+2(5)(3)+9$ can be simplified to $25+30+9=64$.\n## Step 3:  Now, the equation becomes $\\left(\\dfrac{x}{3}\\right)^3-3x^2+81x-729=64$.\n## Step 4:  Next, we move all terms to the left-hand side to set the equation to zero, which gives us $\\left(\\dfrac{x}{3}\\right)^3-3x^2+81x-729-64=0$.\n## Step 5:  Simplifying further, we have $\\left(\\dfrac{x}{3}\\right)^3-3x^2+81x-793=0$.\n## Step 6:  To simplify the equation, we can make the substitution $y=\\frac{x}{3}$. This transforms the equation into $y^3-9y^2+243y-793=0$.\n## Step 7:  Now, we have a cubic equation in terms of $y$. We can attempt to factorize the equation or find its roots using various methods.\n## Step 8:  Upon factoring, we find that the equation can be expressed as $(y-9)(y^2+81)=0$.\n## Step 9:  Since we made the substitution $y=\\frac{x}{3}$, we need to transform our solution back to the original variable $x$. This means we need to solve for $x$ from the equation $\\frac{x}{3}=9$.\n## Step 10:  Multiplying both sides by $3$ gives us the solution for $x$, which is $x=27$.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the real number $x$ that satisfies the given equation is $x=27$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$"
