    "solution": "We start off with $\\emph{1}$ large rectangle. Then the horizontal and vertical lines together split the large rectangle into $\\emph{4}$ smaller rectangles. In addition, the vertical line by itself splits the large rectangle into $\\emph{2}$ rectangles and the horizontal line by itself splits the large rectangle into $\\emph{2}$ other rectangles. There are $1+4+2+2=\\boxed{9}$ different rectangles in the figure.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully count the different rectangles present in the given figure.\n## Step 2:  The figure consists of horizontal and vertical lines, and we need to identify all possible rectangles formed by these lines.\n## Step 3:  First, let's consider the large rectangle that encompasses the entire figure. It is formed by the intersection of the horizontal line at the top and the vertical line at the left, and it has dimensions of 8 units by 5 units.\n## Step 4:  Next, we identify the smaller rectangles within the large rectangle. There are two smaller rectangles that have dimensions of 8 units by 3 units, and two smaller rectangles with dimensions of 6 units by 2 units (but since we have only one pair of lines that can form a 6x2 rectangle, we actually have only 1 of these).\n## Step 5:  Additionally, we can form 4 smaller rectangles with dimensions of 2 units by 3 units within the figure.\n## Step 6:  Lastly, we have 2 smaller rectangles with dimensions of 1 unit by 2 units, and 2 smaller rectangles with dimensions of 1 unit by 3 units.\n## Step 7:  By adding up these different types of rectangles, we can determine the total number of rectangles present in the figure.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the total number of rectangles is $1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 11$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$"
