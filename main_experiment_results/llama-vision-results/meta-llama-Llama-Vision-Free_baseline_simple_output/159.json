    "problem": "A Senate committee has 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent.  In how many ways can they sit around a circular table if all the members of each party all sit next to each other?  (Two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "Choose any seat in which to place the Independent -- it doesn't matter which seat that we choose, since we can rotate the table. Once the Independent's seat has been chosen, either all the Democrats sit to their left and all the Republicans sit to their right, or the other way around. Either way, there are $5!$ ways to put the Democrats in their seats, and $5!$ ways to put the Republicans in their seats. So, the total number of ways to seat the people around the table is $2\\cdot5!\\cdot5!=2\\cdot120\\cdot120=\\boxed{28800}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Consider the parties as single units\nWe need to arrange 3 units (Democrats, Republicans, and Independents) around a circular table.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the units\nSince the table is circular, we consider rotations as equivalent arrangements. So, there are (3-1)! = 2! = 2 ways to arrange the units.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the Democrats\nThere are 5! ways to arrange the Democrats in their designated seats.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the Republicans\nThere are 5! ways to arrange the Republicans in their designated seats.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the Independent\nThere is only 1 way to arrange the Independent in their designated seat.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of arrangements\nThe total number of arrangements is the product of the number of ways to arrange the units, the Democrats, the Republicans, and the Independent. Total = 2 * 5! * 5! * 1 = 2 * 120 * 120 = 28800.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28800}$"
