    "solution": "There are 12 face cards, so there are $\\binom{12}{2}$ ways to choose 2 face cards (without regard to order).  There are $\\binom{52}{2}$ ways to choose any 2 cards (without regard to order).  So the answer is \\[\\frac{\\binom{12}{2}}{\\binom{52}{2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{11}{221}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem requires finding the probability of drawing two face cards (Jacks, Queens, or Kings) from a standard 52-card deck.\n## Step 2:  We first need to determine the probability of drawing one face card from the deck. There are 3 face cards in each suit (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) and there are 4 suits in a deck.\n## Step 3:  So, the total number of face cards in the deck is $3 \\cdot 4 = 12$.\n## Step 4:  The probability of drawing one face card from the deck is therefore $\\frac{12}{52}$.\n## Step 5:  After drawing the first face card, there are 11 face cards remaining in a deck of 51 cards. Thus, the probability of drawing a second face card, given that the first card drawn was a face card, is $\\frac{11}{51}$.\n## Step 6:  To find the total probability of drawing two face cards, we multiply the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event: $\\frac{12}{52} \\cdot \\frac{11}{51}$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the probability that both cards drawn are face cards is $\\frac{12}{52} \\cdot \\frac{11}{51} = \\frac{11}{221}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{221}}$"
