    "problem": "Suppose 2 distinct integers are chosen from 1 through 9, inclusive.  What is the probability that they are both odd?",
    "solution": "Let's consider an `outcome' to be a choice of 2 numbers without regard to order.  There are $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ ways to choose 2 numbers from our set of 9 if we don't care about order.  There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to choose 2 numbers from the 5 odd numbers without regard to order.  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{10}{36} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, we need to determine the total number of distinct pairs of integers that can be chosen from the numbers 1 through 9.\n## Step 2:  Since we are choosing 2 distinct integers from 9, the total number of pairs is given by the combination formula $\\binom{9}{2}=\\frac{9!}{2!(9-2)!}=\\frac{9\\times8}{2}=36$.\n## Step 3:  Next, we need to find the number of pairs of odd integers that can be chosen. There are 5 odd integers between 1 and 9 (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), so the number of pairs of odd integers is given by $\\binom{5}{2}=\\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!}=\\frac{5\\times4}{2}=10$.\n## Step 4:  To find the probability that both integers are odd, we divide the number of pairs of odd integers by the total number of pairs.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the probability that both integers are odd is $\\frac{10}{36}=\\frac{5}{18}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}$"
