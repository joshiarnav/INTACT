    "problem": "200 points are equally spaced on the circumference of a circle.  How many squares can be formed with 4 of the 200 points as vertices?",
    "solution": "For any given one of the 200 points, we can find exactly one square with that point as one of the vertices---that point, the point diametrically opposite it, and the endpoints of the diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter formed by connecting the first two points.  Each square then accounts for 4 vertices, so there are $200/4=\\boxed{50}$ squares.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand that to form a square, we need to select 4 distinct points.\nThe problem is asking us to calculate the number of ways we can choose 4 points from 200 to form squares.\n\n## Step 2: Determine that the order in which we select the points does not matter.\nSince the order of selecting the points does not matter, we are dealing with combinations.\n\n## Step 3: Use the combination formula to find the number of ways to choose 4 points from 200.\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of combinations.\nHere, n = 200 and k = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get C(200, 4) = 200! / (4! * (200 - 4)!).\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression.\nC(200, 4) = 200! / (4! * 196!) = (200 * 199 * 198 * 197) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1).\n\n## Step 6: Perform the multiplication.\n200 * 199 * 198 * 197 = 197,976,000.\n\n## Step 7: Perform the division to get the final answer.\n197,976,000 / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 197,976,000 / 24 = 8,252,500.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8252500}$"
