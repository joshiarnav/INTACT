    "problem": "Suppose that $*(n) = \\left\\{ n-2, n+2, 2n, \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\}$. For example, $*(6) = \\{4, 8, 12, 3\\}$. For how many distinct integers $n$ does $*(n)$ have exactly three distinct elements?",
    "solution": "To have three distinct elements, two of $n-2$, $n+2$, $2n$, and $\\frac{n}{2}$ must be equal. It is clear that $n-2$ can never equal $n+2$. However, any other equality pairing among the four is possible, so we simply check for distinctness. If $2n = \\frac{n}{2}$, the solution is $n= 0$. If $n+ 2 = 2n$, $n = 2$. If $n - 2 = 2n$, $n = -2$. If $\\frac{n}{2} = n - 2$, $n = 4$. Finally, if $\\frac{n}{2} = n+ 2$, $n = -4$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{5}$ such $n$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the function $*(n)$ and its possible values\nThe function $*(n)$ takes an integer $n$ and returns a set of four values: $n-2$, $n+2$, $2n$, and $\\frac{n}{2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the conditions for $*(n)$ to have exactly three distinct elements\nFor $*(n)$ to have exactly three distinct elements, two of the four values must be equal. This can happen in three ways: (i) $n-2 = n+2$, (ii) $n-2 = 2n$, (iii) $n-2 = \\frac{n}{2}$, (iv) $n+2 = 2n$, (v) $n+2 = \\frac{n}{2}$, or (vi) $2n = \\frac{n}{2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the equation $n-2 = n+2$\nThe equation $n-2 = n+2$ has no solution, since it implies $0 = 4$, which is a contradiction.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation $n-2 = 2n$\nThe equation $n-2 = 2n$ has the solution $n = -2$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the equation $n-2 = \\frac{n}{2}$\nThe equation $n-2 = \\frac{n}{2}$ has the solution $n = -4$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the equation $n+2 = 2n$\nThe equation $n+2 = 2n$ has the solution $n = -2$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve the equation $n+2 = \\frac{n}{2}$\nThe equation $n+2 = \\frac{n}{2}$ has the solution $n = -4$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the equation $2n = \\frac{n}{2}$\nThe equation $2n = \\frac{n}{2}$ has the solution $n = 0$.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the number of distinct integers $n$ that satisfy the conditions\nThe solutions to the equations in steps 4, 5, 7 and 8 are distinct integers. Since the equations in steps 3 and 6 do not have solutions, there are 5 distinct integers $n$ that satisfy the conditions.\n\n## Step 10: Verify that the solutions are distinct integers\nWe have verified that the solutions $n = -2, -4, 0$ are distinct integers and that $n = -2$ is a solution to two equations and $n = -4$ is a solution to two equations.\n\n## Step 11: Determine the total number of distinct integers $n$ that satisfy the conditions\nIt can be seen that $n = -2$ and $n = -4$ are counted twice since they satisfy two equations. Therefore, we must subtract 2 from the total count of 5.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the final total of distinct integers\nThe total count of distinct integers $n$ is $5 - 2 = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
