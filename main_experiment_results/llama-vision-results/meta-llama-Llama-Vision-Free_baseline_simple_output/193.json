Given that a dart is thrown that hits the target at a random point, what is the probability that it hits a shaded region?

    "solution": "The total area of the target is $\\pi\\cdot 10^2=100\\pi$.  The area of the inner shaded region is the area of a circle with radius 4, and that is equal to $\\pi\\cdot 4^2=16\\pi$.  We can calculate the area of the shaded ring as the difference in areas of a circle with radius 8 and with radius 6.  This gives an area of $\\pi \\cdot 8^2 - \\pi \\cdot 6^2 = 28\\pi$.  The total shaded area is $16\\pi+28\\pi=44\\pi$.  The probability a dart will hit a shaded region is equal to $\\frac{44\\pi}{100\\pi}=\\boxed{\\frac{11}{25}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the probability that the dart hits a shaded region, we first need to calculate the areas of the regions involved.\n## Step 2: There are four concentric circles in the target, with radii 4 inches, 6 inches, 8 inches, and 10 inches. We need to find the areas of the circles that are shaded and the total area of the target.\n## Step 3: The areas of the circles with radii 2, 3, and 4 are $\\pi \\cdot 2^2 = 4\\pi$, $\\pi \\cdot 3^2 = 9\\pi$, and $\\pi \\cdot 4^2 = 16\\pi$ respectively.\n## Step 4: The area of the shaded region can be calculated as the difference between the area of the circle with radius 4 and the sum of the areas of the circles with radii 2, 3, and 4.\n## Step 5: The area of the shaded region is $16\\pi - (4\\pi + 9\\pi + 16\\pi) = 16\\pi - 29\\pi = -13\\pi$.\n## Step 6: However, this is incorrect as the area of the shaded region cannot be negative. The correct approach is to calculate the area of the shaded region for each individual circle and then sum these areas.\n## Step 7: The area of the shaded region for the circle with radius 4 is $\\pi \\cdot 4^2 - \\pi \\cdot 3^2 = 16\\pi - 9\\pi = 7\\pi$.\n## Step 8: The area of the shaded region for the circle with radius 3 is $\\pi \\cdot 3^2 - \\pi \\cdot 2^2 = 9\\pi - 4\\pi = 5\\pi$.\n## Step 9: The area of the shaded region for the circle with radius 2 is $\\pi \\cdot 2^2 - \\pi \\cdot 1^2 = 4\\pi - \\pi = 3\\pi$.\n## Step 10: The area of the shaded region for the circle with radius 1 is not given but we can assume it to be 0 for this particular problem.\n## Step 11: The total area of the shaded region is $7\\pi + 5\\pi + 3\\pi = 15\\pi$.\n## Step 12: The probability that the dart hits the shaded region can be calculated as the ratio of the area of the shaded region to the total area of the target.\n## Step 13: The total area of the target is the area of the largest circle with radius 5, which is $\\pi \\cdot 5^2 = 25\\pi$.\n## Step 14: Therefore, the probability of hitting the shaded region is $\\frac{15\\pi}{25\\pi} = \\frac{3}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$"
