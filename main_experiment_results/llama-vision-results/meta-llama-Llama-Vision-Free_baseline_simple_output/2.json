    "problem": "We flip a fair coin 10 times.  What is the probability that we get heads in at least 6 of the 10 flips?",
    "solution": "There are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible outcomes of the 10 coin flips. The probability that we flip at least 6 heads is equal to the probability that we flip at least 6 tails, by symmetry.  Let's call this probability $p$.  The only other possibility is that we flip exactly 5 heads and 5 tails, for which the probability is $\\dfrac{\\binom{10}{5}}{2^{10}} = \\dfrac{252}{1024} = \\dfrac{63}{256}$.  Therefore, $\\dfrac{63}{256} + 2p = 1$, giving $$ p=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{63}{256}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{193}{512}} $$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Calculate the total number of possible outcomes when flipping a coin 10 times.\nWhen flipping a coin 10 times, each flip has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails), so the total number of possible outcomes for 10 flips is $2^{10} = 1024$.\n\n## Step 2:  Determine the number of ways to get exactly 6 heads in 10 flips.\nThe number of ways to get exactly 6 heads in 10 flips can be calculated using the combination formula: $\\binom{10}{6} = \\frac{10!}{6!(10-6)!} = \\frac{10!}{6!4!} = \\frac{10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7}{4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot1} = 210$.\n\n## Step 3:  Determine the number of ways to get exactly 7 heads in 10 flips.\nThe number of ways to get exactly 7 heads in 10 flips can be calculated using the combination formula: $\\binom{10}{7} = \\frac{10!}{7!(10-7)!} = \\frac{10!}{7!3!} = \\frac{10\\cdot9\\cdot8}{3\\cdot2\\cdot1} = 120$.\n\n## Step 4:  Determine the number of ways to get exactly 8 heads in 10 flips.\nThe number of ways to get exactly 8 heads in 10 flips can be calculated using the combination formula: $\\binom{10}{8} = \\frac{10!}{8!(10-8)!} = \\frac{10!}{8!2!} = \\frac{10\\cdot9}{2\\cdot1} = 45$.\n\n## Step 5:  Determine the number of ways to get exactly 9 heads in 10 flips.\nThe number of ways to get exactly 9 heads in 10 flips can be calculated using the combination formula: $\\binom{10}{9} = \\frac{10!}{9!(10-9)!} = \\frac{10!}{9!1!} = 10$.\n\n## Step 6:  Determine the number of ways to get exactly 10 heads in 10 flips.\nThe number of ways to get exactly 10 heads in 10 flips can be calculated using the combination formula: $\\binom{10}{10} = \\frac{10!}{10!(10-10)!} = \\frac{10!}{10!0!} = 1$.\n\n## Step 7:  Calculate the total number of ways to get at least 6 heads in 10 flips by summing the results from steps 2 to 6.\nThe total number of ways to get at least 6 heads is the sum of the ways to get exactly 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 heads: $210 + 120 + 45 + 10 + 1 = 386$.\n\n## Step 8:  Calculate the probability of getting at least 6 heads in 10 flips by dividing the result from step 7 by the total number of possible outcomes from step 1.\nThe probability of getting at least 6 heads is $\\frac{386}{1024}$.\n\n## Step 9:  Simplify the probability from step 8 to its simplest form.\nTo simplify the fraction, we can factor out the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator. The greatest common divisor of 386 and 1024 is 2, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2: $\\frac{386}{1024} = \\frac{193}{512}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{193}{512}}$"
