For example, if Annie arrived at 2:00, Xenas could arrive at any time between 2:00 and 2:45 and see Annie at the party.  Let one hour equal one unit.  Then, we can calculate the area of the shaded region as the area of the entire square minus the areas of the two unshaded triangles.  This equals $$2\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4}=\\frac{25}{16}.$$ So the area of the shaded region is $$4-\\frac{25}{16}=\\frac{64-25}{16}= \\frac{39}{16}.$$ Since the area of the square is 4, the probability that Annie and Xenas see each other at the party is $$\\dfrac{39/16}{4} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{39}{64}}.$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Let's visualize the problem by representing the times Annie and Xenas arrive at the party on a coordinate plane, with the x-axis representing the time Annie arrives and the y-axis representing the time Xenas arrives.\n## Step 2:  The region where Annie and Xenas see each other at the party can be shaded to represent the successful outcomes. We can start by identifying the boundaries of this region, which are defined by the times Annie and Xenas arrive.\n## Step 3:  We know that Annie arrives at a random time between 2:00 and 4:00 and stays for 45 minutes, meaning she could arrive anytime between 2:00 and 3:15. Similarly, Xenas also arrives at a random time between 2:00 and 4:00 and stays for 45 minutes.\n## Step 4:  To ensure that they see each other, the difference between their arrival times must be less than 45 minutes, which translates to a shaded region on the coordinate plane. This region is bounded by the lines y = x + 45 and y = x - 45.\n## Step 5:  The total area of the square representing all possible arrival times for Annie and Xenas is 4 units by 4 units, resulting in a total area of 16 square units.\n## Step 6:  To find the area of the shaded region, we can break it down into two triangles. Each triangle has a base and height of 3 units, so the area of one triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 3 = \\frac{9}{2}$ square units. Since there are two identical triangles in the shaded region, the total area of the shaded region is $\\frac{9}{2} + \\frac{9}{2} = 9$ square units.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the probability that Annie and Xenas see each other at the party is the area of the shaded region divided by the total area, which is $\\frac{9}{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{16}}$"
