    "problem": "Tina randomly selects two distinct numbers from the set $$\\{1,2,3,4,5\\},$$and Sergio randomly selects a number from the set $$\\{1,2,\\ldots,10\\}.$$What is the probability that Sergio's number is larger than the sum of the two numbers chosen by Tina?",
    "solution": "There are ten ways for Tina to select a pair of numbers. The sums 9, 8, 4, and 3 can be obtained in just one way, and the sums 7, 6, and 5 can each be obtained in two ways. The probability for each of Sergio's choices is $1/10$. Considering his selections in decreasing order, the total probability of Sergio's choice being greater is \\begin{align*}\n&\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)\\left(1 + \\frac{9}{10} + \\frac{8}{10} +\n\\frac{6}{10} + \\frac{4}{10} + \\frac{2}{10} + \\frac{1}{10} + 0 + 0 + 0\n\\right) \\\\\n& = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine all the possible pairs of distinct numbers that Tina can choose from the set {1,2,3,4,5}.\nTina can choose two distinct numbers from the set {1,2,3,4,5} in 10 ways, since there are 5 numbers to choose from and the order in which she chooses them matters.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the sum of each pair of numbers chosen by Tina.\nThe sums of the pairs of numbers chosen by Tina are:\n- For (1,2), the sum is 1+2=3.\n- For (1,3), the sum is 1+3=4.\n- For (1,4), the sum is 1+4=5.\n- For (1,5), the sum is 1+5=6.\n- For (2,3), the sum is 2+3=5.\n- For (2,4), the sum is 2+4=6.\n- For (2,5), the sum is 2+5=7.\n- For (3,4), the sum is 3+4=7.\n- For (3,5), the sum is 3+5=8.\n- For (4,5), the sum is 4+5=9.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of integers in the set {1,2,...,10} that are greater than each sum calculated in Step 2.\n- For 3, the integers greater than 3 are 4,5,6,7,8,9,10, so there are 7 such integers.\n- For 4, the integers greater than 4 are 5,6,7,8,9,10, so there are 6 such integers.\n- For 5, the integers greater than 5 are 6,7,8,9,10, so there are 5 such integers.\n- For 6, the integers greater than 6 are 7,8,9,10, so there are 4 such integers.\n- For 7, the integers greater than 7 are 8,9,10, so there are 3 such integers.\n- For 8, the integers greater than 8 are 9,10, so there are 2 such integers.\n- For 9, the integers greater than 9 are 10, so there is 1 such integer.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of favorable outcomes.\nThe total number of favorable outcomes is the sum of the number of integers greater than each sum calculated in Step 2.\n7+6+5+4+3+2+1=28.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes.\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the total number of ways Sergio can choose a number from the set {1,2,...,10}, which is 10. Since Tina can choose two distinct numbers in 10 ways, the total number of possible outcomes is 10*10=100.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability that Sergio's number is larger than the sum of the two numbers chosen by Tina.\nThe probability that Sergio's number is larger than the sum of the two numbers chosen by Tina is the total number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\nProbability = 28/100 = 0.28.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction representing the probability.\nThe fraction 28/100 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4.\nSimplified Probability = 7/25.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{25}}$"
