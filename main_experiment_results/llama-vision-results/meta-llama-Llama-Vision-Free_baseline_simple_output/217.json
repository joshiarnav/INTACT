    "problem": "Fruit salad can be made with any $3$ of these $5$ fruits: apples, bananas, grapes, strawberries, and pineapples. If strawberries and pineapples do not taste good together and grapes and bananas do not look appetizing together, how many possible good tasting and appetizing salads are there?",
    "solution": "The number of combinations of fruit possible is $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$. However, if strawberries and pineapples cannot go together, that decreases the number of combinations by three (because they could be paired with apples, grapes, or bananas). Similarly, if grapes and bananas cannot go together, the number of combinations is reduced by another three. Thus, $10 - 3 - 3 = \\boxed{4}$ such salads are possible.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of fruit salad combinations possible with 5 fruits taken 3 at a time.\nThe total number of combinations can be found using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where \"n\" is the total number of items and \"k\" is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 5 (total fruits) and k = 3 (fruits to choose for the salad).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of combinations using the formula.\nApplying the formula, we find C(5, 3) = 5! / [3!(5-3)!] = 5! / (3! * 2!) = (5*4*3) / (3*2) = 10.\n\n## Step 3: Identify combinations that are not allowed due to taste or appearance issues.\nStrawberries and pineapples do not taste good together, and grapes and bananas do not look appetizing together. This means we need to subtract the combinations that include both strawberries and pineapples, and both grapes and bananas. However, we must also consider combinations that include both strawberries and bananas or both grapes and pineapples, as these would also not be allowed.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of combinations that include both strawberries and pineapples.\nSince there are 2 fruits that don't go together, we need to find the combinations of the remaining 3 fruits taken 1 at a time. This is simply C(3, 1) = 3.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of combinations that include both grapes and bananas.\nUsing the same logic as step 4, we need to find combinations of the remaining 3 fruits taken 1 at a time, which is also C(3, 1) = 3.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of combinations that include both strawberries and bananas or both grapes and pineapples.\nHowever, we need to consider combinations that include both strawberries and bananas or both grapes and pineapples. These combinations are actually already accounted for in the combinations that include both strawberries and pineapples and both grapes and bananas.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of combinations that include both strawberries and bananas or both grapes and pineapples.\nSince we've already accounted for the combinations that include both strawberries and pineapples and both grapes and bananas, we don't need to calculate anything else.\n\n## Step 8: Subtract the number of combinations that are not allowed from the total number of combinations to find the good tasting and appetizing salads.\nTotal combinations - not allowed combinations = good combinations. Total combinations = 10, not allowed combinations = 3 (Step 4) + 3 (Step 5). However, we must consider that we've double counted combinations that include both grapes and bananas and strawberries and bananas. Combinations that include both grapes and bananas and strawberries and bananas are actually combinations of the remaining 3 fruits taken 1 at a time, which is 3. We have to subtract this from the total not allowed to avoid double counting. Thus, 10 - (3 + 3 - 3) = 10 - 3 = 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
