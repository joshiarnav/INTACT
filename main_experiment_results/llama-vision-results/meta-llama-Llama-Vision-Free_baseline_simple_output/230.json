    "solution": "The number of three-point sets that can be chosen from the nine grid points is \\[\n\\binom{9}{3} = \\frac{9!}{3!\\cdot 6!} = 84.\n\\]Eight of these sets consist of three collinear points: 3 sets of points lie on vertical lines, 3 on horizontal lines, and 2 on diagonals. Hence the probability is $8/84 = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{21}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the probability that three randomly chosen points from the given grid lie on the same straight line.\n## Step 2:  To start with, we need to understand the total number of three-point sets that can be chosen from the grid. Since there are 9 points in the grid, we can choose 3 points from these 9 in $\\dbinom{9}{3} = 84$ ways.\n## Step 3:  Now, we need to find the number of sets of three points that lie on the same line. These sets include the three points on each row, column, and the two diagonals. There are 3 rows and 3 columns, giving us $3 + 3 = 6$ lines. Additionally, we have 2 diagonals, making a total of 8 lines.\n## Step 4:  However, we also need to consider the number of sets of three points that lie on the same line within the grid. For the lines that are horizontal or vertical, there are 3 sets of three points each. For the diagonals, there is only 1 set of three points.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the total number of sets of three points that lie on the same line is $3 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 1 = 11$. This is because each row and column contributes 3 sets, and each diagonal contributes 2 sets.\n## Step 6:  Having found the total number of sets of points that lie on the same line, we can calculate the probability by taking the ratio of the number of successful outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the probability that three randomly chosen points lie on the same straight line is $\\dfrac{11}{84}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{84}}$"
