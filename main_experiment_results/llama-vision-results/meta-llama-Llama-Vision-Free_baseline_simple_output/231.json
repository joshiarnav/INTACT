    "problem": "Alex has four books of different sizes which he wishes to place on a bookshelf. Unfortunately, the bookshelf has a conspicuous hole at one end through which only the smallest book can fall. If he wishes for all his books to stay stationary, in how many ways can he arrange his books?",
    "solution": "The smallest book cannot be placed at one end, so there are three positions which it can occupy. The other books can each be placed in any of the three remaining positions, giving $3!$ arrangements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $3\\times3!=\\boxed{18\\text{ ways.}}$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the key constraint for arranging the books\nThe smallest book can fall through the hole, so it must be placed at the end of the bookshelf where the hole is located.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the number of choices for the position of the smallest book\nSince the smallest book must be placed at one end, there are only two choices for its position: the left end or the right end.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of arrangements for the remaining three books\nOnce the position of the smallest book is determined, there are three books remaining that can be arranged in any order. The number of arrangements for these three books is 3 factorial (3!), which equals 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways to arrange all four books\nTo find the total number of ways to arrange all four books, we need to multiply the number of choices for the position of the smallest book by the number of arrangements for the remaining three books. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is 2 * 6 = 12.\n\n## Step 5: Account for the fact that some arrangements are the same\nWe don't have to do anything in this step because we have correctly calculated the number of arrangements.\n\n## Step 6: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
