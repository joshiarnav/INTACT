    "problem": "In how many ways can 8 people be seated around a square table with 2 people on a side?  (Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.)",
    "solution": "There are $8!$ ways to place the people around the table, but this counts each valid arrangement 4 times (if you move each person 2, 4, or 6 places clockwise you get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{8!}{4} = \\boxed{10080}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side.\n## Step 2:  First, let's consider the table as a fixed object and arrange the 8 people in a circle, which is the first step in solving the problem.\n## Step 3:  We know that there are (8-1)! = 7! ways to arrange the people in a circle, as there are 7 unique rotations that produce the same configuration.\n## Step 4:  However, we also need to consider the distinct arrangements that can be formed by rotating the table.\n## Step 5:  Since the table is square and has 4 sides, there are 4 unique rotations that result in the same configuration.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, we need to adjust the total number of arrangements to account for these equivalent rotations.\n## Step 7:  This means we divide the total number of arrangements in a circle (7!) by the number of rotations that produce the same configuration (4).\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements around the square table is 7!/4 = 7*6*5*4*3*2*1/4 = 7*6*5*3*2*1 = 2520/4 = 630.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{630}$"
