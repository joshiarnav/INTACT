    "problem": "A fisherman can see seven aquatic creatures in a lake --- four crocodiles, a catfish, and two giant squid. If he does not wish to fish two crocodiles consecutively, in how many orders can he catch all seven creatures? (Individuals from the same species are indistinguishable.)",
    "solution": "The crocodiles must be separated from each other by one of the other creatures, so he must catch them first, third, fifth, and seventh. For the second, fourth, and sixth slots, there are $3!$ ways to arrange the remaining three creatures.\n\nHowever, there are two giant squid, so we must divide by $2!$, the number of ways to arrange the squid.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{3!}{2!}=\\boxed{3}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, let's consider the total number of ways the fisherman can catch all seven creatures without any restrictions.\nThe total number of ways to arrange seven indistinguishable creatures is given by the formula for combinations with repetitions, but since the order matters here and the creatures are to be distinguished by their type, we will use permutations. However, given that the crocodiles are indistinguishable, we must correct for overcounting.\n\n## Step 2: Let's consider the crocodiles as one block and the other creatures (catfish and squid) as separate blocks since the fisherman doesn't want to fish two crocodiles consecutively.\nWe have 5 blocks now - 1 block of crocodiles, 1 catfish, and 2 blocks of squid. We want to order these 5 blocks. There are 5! = 120 ways to order 5 distinct blocks.\n\n## Step 3: Now, let's consider the internal arrangements of the crocodiles since we are treating them as a block.\nSince there are 4 indistinguishable crocodiles within the block, there is 1 way to arrange them (as they are identical).\n\n## Step 4: Within the squid blocks, there are 2! ways to arrange each squid since they are distinguishable.\nHowever, since the squid blocks are indistinguishable, we must divide the total arrangements of the blocks by 2! to correct for overcounting the arrangements of the squid blocks.\n\n## Step 5: Now, we can calculate the total number of orders the fisherman can catch all seven creatures, accounting for the restrictions.\nWe multiply the number of ways to order the 5 blocks by the number of ways to arrange the crocodiles within the block, and divide by the number of ways to arrange the squid blocks, accounting for overcounting. This gives us: $\\frac{5!}{2!} \\times 1 = \\frac{120}{2} = 60$.\n\n## Step 6: However, there's an error in the previous step. The correct way to account for the internal arrangements of the squid and the restriction of consecutive crocodiles is to simply subtract the cases where the crocodiles are consecutive from the total number of arrangements without any restrictions.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions first.\nTo calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions, we need to consider the arrangement of the 7 creatures as distinct. This would be 7! but we must correct for overcounting since the crocodiles are indistinguishable.\n\n## Step 8: Correct for overcounting for the total number of arrangements without restrictions.\nWe have 7! total arrangements, but since there are 4 indistinguishable crocodiles, we must divide by 4! to correct for overcounting.\n\n## Step 9: Now, calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions.\nThis gives us: $\\frac{7!}{4!} = \\frac{5040}{24} = 210$.\n\n## Step 10: Next, let's consider the cases where the crocodiles are consecutive.\nIf we treat the 4 crocodiles as one block, then we have 4 blocks in total (1 crocodile block, 1 catfish block, and 2 squid blocks).\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the total number of arrangements with the crocodiles as one block.\nThere are 4! ways to order these 4 blocks, but we need to correct for overcounting since the squid blocks are indistinguishable.\n\n## Step 12: Correct for overcounting for the squid blocks.\nWe divide by 2! to correct for the overcounting of the squid blocks, giving us: $\\frac{4!}{2!} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12$.\n\n## Step 13: Now, let's consider the internal arrangement of the crocodiles within their block.\nSince there are 4 indistinguishable crocodiles, there is 1 way to arrange them.\n\n## Step 14: Calculate the total number of arrangements with the crocodiles consecutive.\nWe multiply the number of ways to order the 4 blocks by the number of ways to arrange the crocodiles within the block, giving us: $12 \\times 1 = 12$.\n\n## Step 15: Finally, we subtract the cases where the crocodiles are consecutive from the total number of arrangements without any restrictions.\nSubtract the number of arrangements with the crocodiles consecutive from the total number of arrangements without any restrictions: $210 - 12 = 198$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{198}$"
