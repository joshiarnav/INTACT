    "problem": "The positive five-digit integers that use each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 exactly once are ordered from least to greatest. What is the $50^{\\text{th}}$ integer in the list?",
    "solution": "We start with the numbers that start with 1.  There are 4 ways to pick the next digit, then 3 ways to pick the third digit, 2 ways to pick the fourth, and 1 to pick the last.  Therefore, there are $4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24$ integers with 1 as the first digit.  Similarly, another 24 have 2 as the first digit. That's 48 numbers so far, so we want the second smallest number that starts with 3.  The smallest is 31245, and the next smallest is $\\boxed{31254}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of five-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 exactly once. Since the order matters and no digit can be repeated, this is a permutation problem. The total number of permutations of n distinct objects taken r at a time is given by $nPr = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$, where $n!$ denotes the factorial of n. In this case, we have 5 distinct digits, and we are taking 5 at a time, so the total number of possible integers is $5! = 120$.\n\n## Step 2: Understand how the ordering affects the arrangement of the digits. To find the 50th number, we need to consider how the numbers are arranged from least to greatest. The first digit will determine the range of numbers. For example, the numbers starting with 1 will be smaller than the numbers starting with 2.\n\n## Step 3: First, we consider the integers that start with 1. The remaining 4 digits can be arranged in $4! = 24$ ways. Therefore, the first 24 numbers in the list are those that start with 1.\n\n## Step 4: Next, we consider the integers that start with 2. Similarly, the remaining 4 digits can be arranged in $4! = 24$ ways. Therefore, the next 24 numbers in the list are those that start with 2.\n\n## Step 5: We need to find the 50th number in the list. From the previous steps, we know that the first 24 numbers are those that start with 1, and the next 24 numbers are those that start with 2. So, the 50th number will be the first number that starts with 3.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the 50th number that starts with 3. We are looking for the first number in the list that starts with 3. Since the numbers are ordered from least to greatest, we need to find the smallest possible arrangement of the remaining digits (3, 2, 4, 5, 1). The smallest possible number would be 31254.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{31254}$"
