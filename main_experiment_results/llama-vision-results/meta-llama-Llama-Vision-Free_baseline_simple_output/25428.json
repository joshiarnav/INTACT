    "problem": "A standard deck of cards has 26 cards which are considered \"red\" (the 'hearts' and 'diamonds') and 26 which are considered \"black\" (the 'spades' and 'clubs'). In how many different ways can we choose two red cards from the deck? (Note: Order matters in the sense that drawing an ace of hearts followed by jack of diamonds is different than drawing a jack of diamonds followed by ace of hearts, for instance.)",
    "solution": "For the number of successful possibilities, there are 26 ways to pick a red card first (since there are 26 total red cards), then there are 25 ways to also pick a second red card (since there are 25 red cards remaining after we've chosen the first card).  Thus, there are a total of $26 \\times 25 = \\boxed{650}$ total successful possibilities.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the deck composition\nA standard deck of cards consists of 52 cards, divided into two colors: red and black. Each color has its suits: hearts and diamonds are red, and spades and clubs are black. This means there are 13 cards of each red suit and 13 cards of each black suit.\n\n## Step 2: Calculating the number of red cards in the deck\nThe problem specifies that there are 26 red cards in the deck. This is because each of the two red suits (hearts and diamonds) contains 13 cards.\n\n## Step 3: Understanding the task\nWe are asked to find out how many different ways we can choose two red cards from the deck, considering the order of the cards drawn. This means the order of the two chosen red cards matters.\n\n## Step 4: Calculating the number of ways to choose the first card\nThere are 26 red cards in the deck, so there are 26 different ways to choose the first red card.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the number of ways to choose the second card\nAfter choosing the first card, there are 25 red cards left in the deck (since one has been removed). Therefore, there are 25 different ways to choose the second red card.\n\n## Step 6: Applying the rule of product\nSince the order of the cards matters, we use the rule of product to find the total number of ways to choose two red cards. This rule states that if one event can occur in 'm' ways and a second event can occur in 'n' ways, then the events together can occur in m*n ways.\n\n## Step 7: Calculating the total number of ways\nUsing the rule of product, we multiply the number of ways to choose the first card by the number of ways to choose the second card. This gives us 26 * 25 = 650.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{650}$"
