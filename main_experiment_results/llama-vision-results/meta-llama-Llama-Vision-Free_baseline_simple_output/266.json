    "problem": "Suppose that we win $\\$3$ if we flip a heads on a coin toss, but lose $\\$2$ if we flip tails.  What is the expected value, in dollars, of our winnings after one flip?",
    "solution": "In one flip, we have a $1/2$ chance of getting heads and winning 3 dollars, and a $1/2$ chance of getting tails and losing two dollars.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\$3) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\$2) = \\boxed{\\$0.50}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the possible outcomes and their respective probabilities.\nThere are two possible outcomes for a coin toss: heads or tails. Each outcome has a probability of 1/2, since the coin is fair.\n\n## Step 2: Assign a monetary value to each outcome.\nWe win $\\$3$ if we flip heads and lose $\\$2$ if we flip tails.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the expected value using the formula for expected value.\nThe expected value (E) is the sum of the product of each outcome's value and its probability. In this case, the formula is E = (3)(1/2) + (-2)(1/2).\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression to find the expected value.\nE = (3/2) + (-2/2) = 1/2 - 2/2 = -1/2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$"
