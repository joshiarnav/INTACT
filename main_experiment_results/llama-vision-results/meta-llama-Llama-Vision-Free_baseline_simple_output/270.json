    "problem": "If two standard six-sided dice are tossed, what is the probability that a 5 is rolled on at least one of the two dice? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle for this problem. The probability of getting a 5 on the first roll is obviously $\\frac{1}{6}$, as it is on the second roll. So, the probability of getting a 5 on at least one of the rolls would appear to be $2\\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$. But this is not quite right. We have double counted the case of rolling a 5 twice. In that instance, we have included it in both the count for a 5 on the first roll and the second roll, when it only should have been included once overall. So, our answer is $\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{36} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the possible outcomes when two dice are tossed.\nWhen two six-sided dice are tossed, there are 6 possible outcomes for the first die and 6 possible outcomes for the second die. This results in a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of outcomes where at least one 5 is rolled.\nTo calculate the number of outcomes where at least one 5 is rolled, we can use the complementary probability approach. This means we will first find the number of outcomes where no 5 is rolled on either die, and then subtract that from the total number of outcomes to get the number of outcomes where at least one 5 is rolled.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of outcomes where no 5 is rolled on either die.\nThere are 5 possible outcomes for each die that are not a 5. So, the number of outcomes where no 5 is rolled on either die is 5 * 5 = 25.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of outcomes where at least one 5 is rolled.\nThe number of outcomes where at least one 5 is rolled is the total number of outcomes minus the number of outcomes where no 5 is rolled. So, 36 - 25 = 11.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of rolling a 5 on at least one of the two dice.\nThe probability of rolling a 5 on at least one of the two dice is the number of outcomes where at least one 5 is rolled, divided by the total number of outcomes. So, 11 / 36.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}$"
