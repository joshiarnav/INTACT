    "problem": "Amy was born on a Tuesday. What is the probability that exactly two of her three best friends were also born on Tuesday? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Since her friends' birthdays are completely independent of her own, each of them has a $\\frac{1}{7}$ probability of being born on a Tuesday, and a $1 - \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{6}{7}$ probability of not being born on a Tuesday. If exactly 2 friends were born on a Tuesday, the probability of this occurring is ${3 \\choose 2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{6}{7} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{6}{343} = \\boxed{\\frac{18}{343}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of each of Amy's three best friends being born on a Tuesday.\n## Step 2:  Since there are 7 days in a week, the probability of each friend being born on a Tuesday is $\\frac{1}{7}$.\n## Step 3:  Now, to find the probability that exactly two of her three best friends were also born on Tuesday, we need to consider the possible combinations of this scenario.\n## Step 4:  The first friend can be born on a Tuesday in $\\frac{1}{7}$ ways, the second in $\\frac{1}{7}$ ways, and the third in $\\frac{6}{7}$ ways, because the third friend cannot be born on a Tuesday in this case.\n## Step 5:  Now, there are three ways to choose which of Amy's three friends was not born on a Tuesday, as any one of them can be the one not born on a Tuesday. This means we have to multiply the probabilities for each of these scenarios and then multiply by 3 to account for all possible combinations.\n## Step 6:  Thus, we get the probability of exactly two of her three best friends being born on Tuesday as $3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{18}{343}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{18}{343}}$"
