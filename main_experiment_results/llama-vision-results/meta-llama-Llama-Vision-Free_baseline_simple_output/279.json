    "problem": "A box contains exactly five chips, three red and two white. Chips are randomly removed one at a time without replacement until all the red chips are drawn or all the white chips are drawn. What is the probability that the last chip drawn is white?",
    "solution": "Think of continuing the drawing until all five chips are removed from the box. There are ten possible orderings of the colors: RRRWW, RRWRW, RWRRW, WRRRW, RRWWR, RWRWR, WRRWR, RWWRR, WRWRR, and WWRRR. The six orderings that end in R represent drawings that would have ended when the second white chip was drawn. Therefore, the probability that the last chip drawn is white if we stop at the last red or the last white is $6/10 = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}.$\n\nOR\n\nImagine drawing until only one chip remains. If the remaining chip is red, then that draw would have ended when the second white chip was removed. The remaining chip will be red with probability $3/5,$ which means that the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$ that the last chip drawn from the box is white.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We need to find the probability that the last chip drawn from the box is white. The box contains 3 red and 2 white chips.\n## Step 2:  To solve this, we first note that the last chip drawn must be white. This means that all the red chips must have been drawn before the last chip.\n## Step 3:  The possible orders in which the chips can be drawn are: $R_1, R_2, R_3, W_1$ or $R_1, R_2, W_1, R_3$ or $R_1, W_1, R_2, R_3$ or $W_1, R_1, R_2, R_3$ or $R_1, R_2, R_3, W_1$.\n## Step 4:  We want to find the probability of the last set of chips being drawn in the order $W_1, R_1, R_2, R_3$. This set is one of the five possible orders, so it has a $\\frac{1}{5}$ probability of occurring.\n## Step 5:  The probability of the last set of chips being drawn in the order $W_1, R_1, R_2, R_3$ is $\\frac{1}{5}$, but this is not the probability that the last chip drawn is white.\n## Step 6:  We should also consider the probability of the chips being drawn in the order $R_1, R_2, R_3, W_1$, which is also $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n## Step 7:  Since there are two possible orders that lead to the last chip being white, the probability that the last chip drawn is white is $\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$"
