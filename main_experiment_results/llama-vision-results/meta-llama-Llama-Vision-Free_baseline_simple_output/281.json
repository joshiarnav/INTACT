    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the constraints and the grid layout provided.\n## Step 2:  The grid has 6 columns and 5 rows, with the starting point labeled as $E$ at the top right corner and the ending point labeled as $G$ at the bottom left corner.\n## Step 3:  We are tasked with finding the number of 9-step paths from point $E$ to point $G$ on this grid.\n## Step 4:  To reach $G$ from $E$, we must take 4 steps to the right and 5 steps down in any order, totaling 9 steps.\n## Step 5:  We can approach this problem by finding the number of ways to choose 4 steps out of the 9 total steps to be \"right\" (and the remaining 5 will be \"down\"), which is a classic combination problem.\n## Step 6:  The number of ways to choose $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n!$ represents the factorial of $n$, which is the product of all positive integers up to $n$.\n## Step 7:  In our case, we want to choose 4 \"right\" steps out of 9 total steps, so we can calculate the number of paths as $\\binom{9}{4} = \\frac{9!}{4!(9-4)!} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}$.\n## Step 8:  By simplifying the expression, we get $\\frac{9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{3024}{24} = 126$.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{126}$ 9-step paths from $E$ to $G$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{126}$"
