    "problem": "The wheel shown is spun twice, so that the numbers indicated by the pointer are randomly determined (with each number on the wheel being equally likely). The two numbers determined in this way are recorded. The first number is divided by 4, determining one of the remainders 1,2,3 marking the columns of the checkerboard shown. The second number is divided by 5, determining one of the remainders 1,2,3,4 marking the rows of the checkerboard. Finally, a checker is placed on the square where this column and row meet. What is the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square of the checkerboard?\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1cm);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((1.7,1)--(-1.7,-1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((1.7,-1)--(-1.7,1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,2)--(0,-2));\nlabel(\"1\",(0.8,0.5),NW);\nlabel(\"2\",(0.8,-0.5),SW);\nlabel(\"6\",(-0.8,0.5),NE);\nlabel(\"9\",(-0.8,-0.5),SE);\nlabel(\"3\",(-0.7,0),W);\nlabel(\"7\",(0.7,0),E);\ndraw((-2.8,0)--(-2.1,0),Arrow);\nlabel(\"Pointer\",(-2.8,0),W);\nfill((3,0)--(3,1)--(4,1)--(4,0)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfill((3,-2)--(3,-1)--(4,-1)--(4,-2)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfill((4,1)--(4,2)--(5,2)--(5,1)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfill((4,-1)--(4,0)--(5,0)--(5,-1)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfill((5,0)--(5,1)--(6,1)--(6,0)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfill((5,-2)--(5,-1)--(6,-1)--(6,-2)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw((3,-2)--(3,2)--(6,2)--(6,-2)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((3,-1)--(6,-1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((3,0)--(6,0),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((3,1)--(6,1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((4,-2)--(4,2),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((5,-2)--(5,2),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"1\",(3.5,-2),S);\nlabel(\"2\",(4.5,-2),S);\nlabel(\"3\",(5.5,-2),S);\nlabel(\"1\",(3,-1.5),W);\nlabel(\"2\",(3,-0.5),W);\nlabel(\"3\",(3,0.5),W);\nlabel(\"4\",(3,1.5),W);\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "The first remainder is even with probability $2/6=1/3$ and odd with probability 2/3.  The second remainder is even with probability $3/6=1/2$ and odd with probability 1/2.  The parity of the first remainder and the parity of the second remainder are independent, since they're determined by separate spins of the wheel.\n\nThe shaded squares are those that indicate that both remainders are odd or both are even. Hence the square is shaded with probability \\[\n\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2} =\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\n\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem describes a scenario where a wheel is spun twice, determining two numbers randomly.\n## Step 2:  The first number obtained is divided by 4, and the remainder (1, 2, or 3) is used to mark a column on a checkerboard.\n## Step 3:  Similarly, the second number is divided by 5, and the remainder (1, 2, 3, or 4) is used to mark a row on the checkerboard.\n## Step 4:  The checker is then placed on the square where this column and row meet.\n## Step 5:  We are required to find the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square of the checkerboard.\n## Step 6:  To approach this problem, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each number obtained from spinning the wheel and how they determine the position of the checker on the checkerboard.\n## Step 7:  The first number that is divided by 4 can result in remainders of 1, 2, or 3, which correspond to the columns of the checkerboard.\n## Step 8:  Similarly, the second number divided by 5 can result in remainders of 1, 2, 3, or 4, which correspond to the rows of the checkerboard.\n## Step 9:  The total number of possible pairs of remainders is $3 \\times 4 = 12$.\n## Step 10:  We need to find the number of pairs of remainders that result in the checker being placed on a shaded square.\n## Step 11:  We can observe that for the checker to be placed on a shaded square, the remainder when the first number is divided by 4 must be 1, 2, or 3, and the remainder when the second number is divided by 5 must be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n## Step 12:  We notice that there is exactly one shaded square in each of the 6 possible pairs of remainders.\n## Step 13:  Therefore, the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square is the ratio of the number of successful outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.\n## Step 14:  Since there are 6 pairs of remainders that result in a shaded square and a total of 12 possible pairs of remainders, the probability is $\\frac{6}{12} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$"
