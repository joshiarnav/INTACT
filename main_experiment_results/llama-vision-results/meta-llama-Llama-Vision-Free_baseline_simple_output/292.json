    "problem": "How many positive three-digit numbers are not multiples of 7?",
    "solution": "It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \\times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $142 \\times 7 = 994$.  Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers which are multiples of 7.  There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-128 = \\boxed{772}$ three-digit numbers which are not multiples of 7.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of positive three-digit numbers and then subtract the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7.\n## Step 2:  First, let's calculate the total number of positive three-digit numbers. The smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999. So, the total number of positive three-digit numbers is $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$.\n## Step 3:  Now, we need to find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7. The smallest three-digit number that is a multiple of 7 is 105, and the largest is 994.\n## Step 4:  To find the number of multiples of 7 in this range, we use the formula $\\frac{\\text{largest value} - \\text{smallest value}}{\\text{common difference}} + 1$. Applying this formula, we get $\\frac{994 - 105}{7} + 1 = 128$.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, there are 128 three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7.\n## Step 6:  Finally, to find the number of three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7, we subtract the number of multiples of 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers, giving us $900 - 128 = 772$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{772}$"
