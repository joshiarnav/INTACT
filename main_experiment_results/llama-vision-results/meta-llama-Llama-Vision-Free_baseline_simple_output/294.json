    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes?",
    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, the only thing we need to keep track of is how many balls are in each box.  In this case, we can just list the cases: we put either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 balls into the first box, and the rest into the second box.  Thus there are $\\boxed{5}$ ways to arrange 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the number of ways to distribute 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the possible distributions\nSince the balls are indistinguishable, we only need to consider the number of balls in each box. The possible distributions are: (4,0), (3,1), (2,2), (1,3), and (0,4).\n\n## Step 3: Count the number of ways for each distribution\nFor (4,0), there is 1 way to put all the balls in one box.\nFor (3,1), there is 1 way to put 3 balls in one box and 1 in the other.\nFor (2,2), there is 1 way to put 2 balls in each box.\nFor (1,3), there is 1 way to put 1 ball in one box and 3 in the other.\nFor (0,4), there is 1 way to put all the balls in the other box.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways\nWe count the number of ways for each distribution and add them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
