    "problem": "How many positive integers less than or equal to 100 have a prime factor that is greater than 4?",
    "solution": "The easiest solution is to find the number of positive integers with only 2 and 3 as their prime factors. If the number has no factors of 3, the qualifying numbers are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6$ for 7 total. If there is one factor of 3, we have $2^0 \\cdot 3^1, 2^1 \\cdot 3^1, 2^2 \\cdot 3^1, 2^3 \\cdot 3^1, 2^4 \\cdot 3^1, 2^5 \\cdot 3^1$ for 6 total. With two factors of 3, we have $2^0 \\cdot 3^2, 2^1 \\cdot 3^2, 2^2 \\cdot 3^2, 2^3 \\cdot 3^2$ for 4 total. With three factors of 3, we have $2^0 \\cdot 3^3, 2^1 \\cdot 3^3$ for 2 total. Finally, $3^4$ gives us 1 more. So, there are $7+ 6+4+2+1 = 20$ positive integers less than or equal to 100 that have only 2 and 3 as prime factors. Therefore, there are $100-20 = \\boxed{80}$ positive integers less than or equal to 100 that have a prime factor greater than 4.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem is asking us to count the number of positive integers less than or equal to 100 that have a prime factor greater than 4.\n## Step 2:  First, we need to identify the prime numbers greater than 4 that are less than or equal to 100. These primes are 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.\n## Step 3:  To find the count of numbers with a prime factor greater than 4, we can start by finding the count of numbers that do not have any prime factors greater than 4. This will be the complement of the set we are looking for.\n## Step 4:  The numbers that do not have any prime factors greater than 4 are those that are only divisible by 1, 2, and 3, or any combination of these. We need to count the numbers that are only divisible by 2, 3, and the combinations thereof, as these are the numbers with prime factors less than or equal to 4.\n## Step 5:  The multiples of 2 that are less than or equal to 100 are 2, 4, 6, ..., 100. There are 50 of these. The multiples of 4 that are less than or equal to 100 are 4, 8, 12, ..., 100. There are 25 of these. The multiples of 3 that are less than or equal to 100 are 3, 6, 9, ..., 99. There are 33 of these. We need to be careful not to double count the numbers that are multiples of both 2 and 3, so we must subtract those.\n## Step 6:  The multiples of 6 that are less than or equal to 100 are 6, 12, 18, ..., 96. There are 16 of these. So, we have a total of $50 + 25 + 33 - 16 = 92$ numbers that are multiples of 2, 3, or both.\n## Step 7:  Since there are 100 positive integers less than or equal to 100, the number of positive integers that are not multiples of 2, 3, or both is $100 - 92 = 8$.\n## Step 8:  However, we must also consider that we have counted the numbers that are multiples of 4 and 6 twice. We need to add back the multiples of 12 that are less than or equal to 100, which are 12, 24, 36, ..., 96. There are 8 of these.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the total number of positive integers less than or equal to 100 that are not multiples of 2, 3, or both is $8 + 8 = 16$.\n## Step 10:  However, we also need to consider that we have counted the numbers that are multiples of 2 and 3 only once, since they are multiples of 6. So, we must add the multiples of 6 back in, but we have already added them once, so we do not need to add them again.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the total number of positive integers less than or equal to 100 that have a prime factor greater than 4 is $100 - 16 = 84$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{84}$"
