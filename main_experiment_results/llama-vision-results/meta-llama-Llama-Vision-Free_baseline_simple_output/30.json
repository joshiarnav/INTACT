    "problem": "How many primes are in the row of Pascal's Triangle that starts with a $1$ followed by a $6$?",
    "solution": "If the row contains a $1$, then a $6$, then the binomial coefficients must be $\\binom{6}{0}$ and $\\binom{6}{1}$. All we need to check now are $\\binom{6}{2}$ and $\\binom{6}{3}$, since $\\binom{6}{0} = \\binom{6}{6}$, $\\binom{6}{1} = \\binom{6}{5}$ , and $\\binom{6}{2} = \\binom{6}{4}$. $\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{4! \\times 2!} = 15$, and $\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3! \\times 3!} = 20$. None of those is prime, so there are $\\boxed{0}$ prime numbers in the given row.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the number of primes in the row of Pascal's Triangle that starts with a $1$ followed by a $6$, we first need to understand how the numbers in Pascal's Triangle are generated.\n## Step 2:  Each number in Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it, and the first and last numbers in each row are always $1$. So, the row in question is the $7^{th}$ row of Pascal's Triangle, which reads $1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1$.\n## Step 3:  To determine which of these numbers are primes, we need to check each number in the row to see if it has any divisors other than $1$ and itself.\n## Step 4:  The number $6$ is not prime because it can be factored into $2 \\times 3$, the number $15$ is also not prime as it can be factored into $3 \\times 5$, and the same goes for $20$, which can be factored into $4 \\times 5$.\n## Step 5:  We can determine the primality of the remaining numbers using the fact that a prime number is only divisible by $1$ and itself. \n## Step 6:  If we try to divide any of the other numbers in the row by $2$, $3$, or $5$, we find that none of them are divisible by these prime numbers. Therefore, the remaining numbers, $1$ and $6$, are the only ones that are not prime.\n## Step 7:  The number $1$ is not considered a prime number, but $6$ is not a prime number as we discussed earlier. \n## Step 8:  Hence, the row of Pascal's Triangle that starts with a $1$ followed by a $6$ contains $\\boxed{0}$ primes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"
