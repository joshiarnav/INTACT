    "problem": "Sarah wants to order a pizza with 2 different toppings. She has 9 different toppings to choose from. How many different pizzas could she order?",
    "solution": "There are 9 choices of toppings, and we need to choose 2 distinct toppings. This is represented by the number of 2-element subsets of a 9-element set. We use the binomial coefficient ${9 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{36}$ to compute this.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the type of problem\nThis is a combinations problem because the order of the toppings does not matter.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the number of items to choose from\nSarah has 9 different toppings to choose from.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the number of items to choose\nSarah wants to choose 2 different toppings.\n\n## Step 4: Use the combinations formula\nThe number of combinations can be found using the formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the number of items to choose from and k is the number of items to choose.\n\n## Step 5: Plug in the values\nC(9, 2) = 9! / (2!(9-2)!) = 9! / (2!7!)\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the factorials\n9! = 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 362880\n2! = 2 x 1 = 2\n7! = 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5040\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression\nC(9, 2) = 362880 / (2 x 5040) = 362880 / 10080\n\n## Step 8: Perform the division\nC(9, 2) = 36\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$"
