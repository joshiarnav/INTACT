    "solution": "Since $x$ and $1/x$ are integers, we know that $x$ is an integer that divides 1 evenly.  Therefore, we must have $x = -1$ or $x = 1$. The same is true for $y$ and $z$. So, the possible sums are $3(-1) = -3$, $2(-1) + 1 = -1$, $2(1) + -1 = 1$ or $3(1) = 3$. So there are $\\boxed{4}$ possible values for the sum.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Let's consider the possible values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ since $x$, $\\frac{1}{x}$, $y$, $\\frac{1}{y}$, $z$, and $\\frac{1}{z}$ are all integers. This means that $x$, $y$, and $z$ can be $1$, $-1$, or $0$.\n\n## Step 2: Given that $x$, $y$, and $z$ are integers, the sum $x+y+z$ can be any integer. We need to determine how many distinct values of $x+y+z$ are possible.\n\n## Step 3: When $x=0$, $y=0$, or $z=0$, the sum $x+y+z$ is $0$. Therefore, one distinct value of $x+y+z$ is $0$.\n\n## Step 4: When $x=1$, $y=1$, and $z=1$, the sum $x+y+z$ is $3$. Therefore, one distinct value of $x+y+z$ is $3$.\n\n## Step 5: When $x=-1$, $y=-1$, and $z=-1$, the sum $x+y+z$ is $-3$. Therefore, one distinct value of $x+y+z$ is $-3$.\n\n## Step 6: Let's consider the case when two variables are equal to $1$ and the third variable is equal to $-1$. When $x=1$, $y=1$, and $z=-1$, the sum $x+y+z$ is $1$. When $x=1$, $y=-1$, and $z=1$, the sum $x+y+z$ is $1$. When $x=-1$, $y=1$, and $z=1$, the sum $x+y+z$ is $1$. Therefore, one distinct value of $x+y+z$ is $1$.\n\n## Step 7: Similarly, there is one distinct value for the sum $x+y+z$ when two variables are equal to $-1$ and the third variable is equal to $1$: $-1$.\n\n## Step 8: When one variable is equal to $1$, one variable is equal to $-1$, and one variable is equal to $0$, the sum $x+y+z$ is $0$ or $0$. Therefore, we already counted this case.\n\n## Step 9: In the case where one variable is equal to $0$ and the other two variables are equal to $-1$, the sum $x+y+z$ is $-2$. Similarly, in the case where one variable is equal to $0$ and the other two variables are equal to $1$, the sum $x+y+z$ is $2$. Therefore, we have two more distinct values of $x+y+z$: $-2$ and $2$.\n\n## Step 10: In the case where one variable is equal to $1$ and the other two variables are equal to $0$, the sum $x+y+z$ is $1$. Similarly, in the case where one variable is equal to $-1$ and the other two variables are equal to $0$, the sum $x+y+z$ is $-1$. Therefore, we have two more distinct values of $x+y+z$: $1$ and $-1$.\n\n## Step 11: Now, let's consider the case when two variables are equal to $0$ and one variable is equal to $-1$ or $1$. In this case, the sum $x+y+z$ is either $-1$ or $1$.\n\n## Step 12: When one variable is equal to $1$, one variable is equal to $-1$, and one variable is equal to $0$, the sum $x+y+z$ is $0$. We have already counted this case.\n\n## Step 13: Now, we have counted all possible cases. The distinct values of $x+y+z$ are $0$, $1$, $-1$, $2$, $-2$, $3$, and $-3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
