    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the maximum number of intersection points that can occur between any two circles.\n## Step 2:  Each pair of circles can intersect at a maximum of 2 points. If we have 4 distinct circles, we can calculate the maximum number of intersection points by considering all possible pairs of circles.\n## Step 3:  There are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ pairs of circles. For each pair, there can be at most 2 intersection points.\n## Step 4:  This means that the total maximum number of intersection points for all 4 circles can be calculated by multiplying the number of pairs of circles (6) by the maximum number of intersection points per pair (2).\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the maximum number of points where at least two of the circles intersect is $6 \\times 2 = 12$.\n## Step 6:  Hence, the maximum number of points where at least two of the circles intersect is 12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
