    "problem": "There are seven wombats in a council. Three of them are hairy-nosed wombats, while the rest are all different species. If the hairy-nosed wombats are indistinguishable but the other wombats are, how many ways can the wombats seat themselves in a row?",
    "solution": "There are $7!$ ways to arrange all the wombats. However, because the order of the hairy-nosed wombats does not matter, we've overcounted by the number of ways to arrange those three wombats, or $3!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{7!}{3!}=\\boxed{840}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We first need to determine the total number of ways the seven wombats can be seated in a row without any restrictions.\n## Step 2:  To do this, we consider that there are 7 choices for the first seat, 6 choices for the second seat, 5 choices for the third seat, and so on, until there is only one choice for the last seat.\n## Step 3:  Multiplying these choices together gives us the total number of ways to seat the wombats, which is 7! (7 factorial).\n## Step 4:  The 7! is calculated as 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, which equals 5040.\n## Step 5:  Next, we need to consider the restrictions imposed by the indistinguishable hairy-nosed wombats.\n## Step 6:  Since the three hairy-nosed wombats are indistinguishable, we must adjust the total number of seatings to account for this.\n## Step 7:  We can think of the three hairy-nosed wombats as being a single unit, which can be arranged in 7!/(3!) ways.\n## Step 8:  Here, the 7! represents the number of ways to arrange all 7 wombats, and the 3! represents the number of ways to arrange the 3 hairy-nosed wombats among themselves (since they are indistinguishable).\n## Step 9:  The number 7!/(3!) is calculated as (7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1)/(3 x 2 x 1), which equals 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 2 x 1.\n## Step 10:  Calculating this, we get 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 2 x 1 = 840.\n## Step 11:  However, we must also consider the arrangement of the 4 remaining wombats, which can be done in 4! ways.\n## Step 12:  The total number of ways to seat the wombats is then 840 x 4!.\n## Step 13:  Calculating this, we get 840 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 20160.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20160}$"
