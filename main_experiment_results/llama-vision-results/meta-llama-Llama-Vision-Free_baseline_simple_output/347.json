    "problem": "How many unique diagonals can be drawn in a five-sided convex polygon?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ pairs of vertices.  Five of these pairs correspond to adjacent vertices, which when connected yield edges of the pentagon.  Connecting any one of the $10-5=\\boxed{5}$ remaining pairs of vertices yields a diagonal.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the number of unique diagonals in a five-sided convex polygon, we first need to understand what constitutes a diagonal in a polygon.\n## Step 2:  A diagonal is a line segment that connects two non-adjacent vertices of a polygon. This means it cannot be a side of the polygon.\n## Step 3:  In a five-sided polygon, also known as a pentagon, we have 5 vertices. To draw a diagonal, we can choose any two of these 5 vertices.\n## Step 4:  However, we need to exclude the cases where the two chosen vertices are adjacent (i.e., they share a side), because those would not be diagonals.\n## Step 5:  To calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 vertices out of 5, we use the combination formula, denoted as $\\binom{n}{k}$, which gives the number of ways to choose k items from n items without regard to the order. In this case, $\\binom{5}{2}$.\n## Step 6:  This gives us $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5*4}{2} = 10$ ways to choose 2 vertices.\n## Step 7:  Now, we need to subtract the 5 pairs of adjacent vertices, because each pair of adjacent vertices does not form a diagonal.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the number of unique diagonals in a five-sided convex polygon is $10 - 5 = 5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
