    "problem": "In how many ways can 5 different keys be placed on a keychain?  (Two arrangements are considered the same if one can be rotated or flipped to be identical to the other.)",
    "solution": "There are $5!$ ways to place the keys on the keychain, but we must divide by 5 for rotational symmetry (5 rotations for each arrangement), and by 2 for reflectional symmetry (we can flip the keychain to get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{5!}{5 \\times 2} = \\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Consider the total number of arrangements without considering rotations or flips\nThere are 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120 ways to arrange the 5 keys on the keychain.\n\n## Step 2: Account for rotational symmetry\nThe keychain can be rotated 5 times to be in the same position. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by 5 to account for rotational symmetry: 120/5 = 24.\n\n## Step 3: Account for reflection symmetry\nThe keychain can also be flipped over. Therefore, we need to divide the number of arrangements by 2 to account for reflection symmetry: 24/2 = 12.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the total number of unique arrangements\nAfter accounting for both rotational and reflection symmetry, we find that there are 12 unique arrangements of the 5 keys on the keychain.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
