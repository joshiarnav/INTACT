    "problem": "One fair die has faces 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3 and another has faces 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6. The dice  are rolled and the numbers on the top faces are added. What is the probability that the sum will be odd?",
    "solution": "An odd sum requires either that  the first die is even and the second is odd or that the first die is odd and the second is even. The probability  is \\[\n\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}=\n\\frac{1}{9}+\\frac{4}{9}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}.\n\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of outcomes when rolling two dice.\nEach die has 6 faces, so when rolling two dice, there are 6 * 6 = 36 total possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 2: Identify which outcomes result in an odd sum.\nTo have an odd sum, one die must show an odd number and the other must show an even number.\n\n## Step 3: Enumerate the odd and even faces on each die.\nDie 1 has faces 1, 1, 3, 3, which are odd, and faces 2, 2, which are even. Die 2 has faces 4, 4, which are even, and faces 5, 5, 6, 6, which are even.\n\n## Step 4: Correct the enumeration of faces for each die.\nDie 1 actually has faces 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, so it has 3 odd faces and 3 even faces. Die 2 has faces 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, so it has 3 even faces and 3 odd faces.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of outcomes that result in an odd sum.\nThe number of ways to choose one odd face from Die 1 and one even face from Die 2 is 3 * 3 = 9, and the number of ways to choose one even face from Die 1 and one odd face from Die 2 is also 3 * 3 = 9. So, the total number of outcomes resulting in an odd sum is 9 + 9 = 18.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability that the sum will be odd.\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, so the probability that the sum will be odd is 18 / 36.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction.\nThe fraction 18 / 36 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 18. 18 / 18 = 1 and 36 / 18 = 2, so 18 / 36 simplifies to 1 / 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$"
