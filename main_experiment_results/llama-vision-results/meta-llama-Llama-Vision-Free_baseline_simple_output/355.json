    "problem": "What is the greatest positive integer $n$ such that $3^n$ is a factor of $200!$?",
    "solution": "If we want the largest such $n$, we must count the number of factors of 3 in the prime factorization of $200!$. The number of multiples of 3 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3} \\right\\rfloor$.  (The notation $\\left\\lfloor x\\right\\rfloor$ means the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, so basically, $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ means ``divide 200 by 3 and round down.\")   However, these are not the only factors of 3 in the product!  Multiples of 9 in the product contribute an extra factor of 3. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{9} \\right\\rfloor$ of these, so we add this number to the $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ factors of 3 we found from counting multiples of 3.  Similarly, we must add in multiples of 27 once and multiples of 81.\n\nThe sum is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{9} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{27} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{81} \\right\\rfloor = 66 + 22 + 7 + 2 = \\boxed{97}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the prime factorization of 200!\nTo find the greatest positive integer $n$ such that $3^n$ is a factor of $200!$, we first need to determine the prime factorization of $200!$. This involves breaking down $200!$ into its prime factors and their respective powers.\n\n## Step 2: Count the number of factors of 3 in 200!\nWe know that the prime factorization of $200!$ includes many factors of 3, since $200!$ is the product of all integers from 1 to 200. To count the number of factors of 3 in $200!$, we will first count the multiples of 3, then the multiples of $3^2$, and finally the multiples of $3^3$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of multiples of 3 in 200!\nThe number of multiples of 3 in $200!$ can be calculated by dividing 200 by 3, which gives us 66. This represents the number of times 3 appears as a factor in the prime factorization of $200!$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of multiples of $3^2$ in 200!\nNext, we need to calculate the number of multiples of $3^2$ in $200!$. This can be done by dividing 200 by $3^2$, which gives us 33. However, we must subtract the multiples of $3^3$ to avoid overcounting.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of multiples of $3^3$ in 200!\nTo find the number of multiples of $3^3$, we divide 200 by $3^3$, which equals 6. This is the maximum number of times $3^3$ can appear as a factor in the prime factorization of $200!$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of factors of 3 in 200!\nNow that we have the counts for the multiples of 3, $3^2$, and $3^3$, we can calculate the total number of factors of 3 in $200!$. We add the counts of multiples of 3 and $3^2$, and then add the count of multiples of $3^3$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the greatest positive integer $n$\nThe total number of factors of 3 in $200!$ represents the greatest positive integer $n$ such that $3^n$ is a factor of $200!$. We sum the counts from the previous steps to find this value.\n\n## Step 8: Final calculation\nTo find the value of $n$, we add the number of multiples of 3, the number of multiples of $3^2$, and subtract the number of multiples of $3^3$, since they are counted twice.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the value of n\n66 + 33 - 6 = 93.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{93}$"
