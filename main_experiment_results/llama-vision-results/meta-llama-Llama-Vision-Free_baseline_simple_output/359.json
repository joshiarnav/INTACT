    "problem": "Joe's batting average is .323.  (That is, he averages 0.323 hits per at bat.)  What is the probability that he will get three hits in three at-bats? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "Each of Joe's hits is independent of the others. That is, the probability for one hit does not change depending on whether he hit or missed the previous ball. So, to calculate the probability that he will get three hits in three at-bats, we simply cube $0.323$ to get $0.033$. Rounded to the nearest hundredth, this gives $\\boxed{0.03}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Joe's batting average is .323, which means that he gets a hit in 32.3% of his at-bats.\n## Step 2:  To find the probability that Joe will get three hits in three at-bats, we need to consider the probability of each individual at-bat resulting in a hit.\n## Step 3:  Since each at-bat is an independent event, we can multiply the probabilities of each at-bat resulting in a hit to find the overall probability of three hits in three at-bats.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, the probability of getting three hits in three at-bats is $(0.323)(0.323)(0.323)$, which is approximately $0.323^3$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we need to calculate the value of $0.323^3$ to find the final probability.\n## Step 6:  Using a calculator, $0.323^3 \\approx 0.0339$.\n## Step 7:  However, we are asked to express the answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.\n## Step 8:  Rounding $0.0339$ to the nearest hundredth gives us $0.03$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.03}$"
