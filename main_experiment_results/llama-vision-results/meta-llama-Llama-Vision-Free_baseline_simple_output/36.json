    "problem": "How many different three-digit odd numbers can be formed using the digits 3, 4, 5 and 6 if digits cannot be repeated?",
    "solution": "Begin by constructing the number from the units digit and working up to the hundreds digit. There are two possible choices for the units digit: $3$ and $5$ (since the number must be odd). Then, after choosing that digit, there are three possible choices for the tens digit ($4$, $6$, and the remaining odd digit), since digits cannot be repeated. Finally, there are then two possible choices for the hundreds digit. Thus, there are $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{12}$ such numbers that can be formed.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To form an odd number, the units place must be an odd digit.\nThe digits 3 and 5 are odd, so we have two choices for the units place.\n\n## Step 2: After choosing the units place, we have three remaining digits to choose from for the hundreds place.\nSince we cannot repeat digits, there are three choices for the hundreds place.\n\n## Step 3: After choosing the hundreds and units place, we have two remaining digits to choose from for the tens place.\nSince we cannot repeat digits, there are two choices for the tens place.\n\n## Step 4: To find the total number of different three-digit odd numbers, we multiply the number of choices for each place.\nMultiplying the number of choices for each place, we get 2 * 3 * 2 = 12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
