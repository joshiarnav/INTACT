    "problem": "In a class of 28 students, the teacher selects four people at random to participate in a geography contest. What is the probability that this group of four students includes at least two of the top three geography students in the class? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We count the number of ways to choose a group of four students including at least two of the top three geography students.  This is just  $\\binom{3}{2}\\cdot \\binom{25}{2} + \\binom{3}{3}\\cdot\\binom{25}{1} = 925$, since we can choose either 2 or 3 of the top students to be in this group.  In all, there are $\\binom{28}{4} = 20475$ groups of four students.  Thus our desired probability is $\\frac{925}{20475} = \\boxed{\\frac{37}{819}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the probability that the group of four students includes at least two of the top three geography students, we first need to understand the total number of possible groups of four students that can be selected from the class of 28 students.\n## Step 2:  This can be calculated using combinations, where the number of ways to choose 4 students out of 28 is given by $\\binom{28}{4}=\\frac{28!}{4!(28-4)!}=28\\cdot27\\cdot26\\cdot25=358\\,800$.\n## Step 3:  Now, we want to find the number of successful outcomes, where a successful outcome is a group of four students that includes at least two of the top three geography students.\n## Step 4:  We can break this down into two cases: one where the group includes exactly two of the top three students, and the other where the group includes all three of the top students.\n## Step 5:  If there are exactly two top students in the group, there are $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ ways to choose the two top students, and $\\binom{25}{2}=300$ ways to choose two more students from the remaining 25 students. This gives us a total of $3\\cdot300=900$ successful outcomes for this case.\n## Step 6:  If the group includes all three of the top students, there is only $\\binom{25}{1}=25$ ways to choose the fourth student from the remaining 25 students.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the total number of successful outcomes is $900+25=925$.\n## Step 8:  Now that we have the total number of successful outcomes, we can find the probability of selecting a group that includes at least two of the top three students by dividing the number of successful outcomes by the total number of possible groups.\n## Step 9:  This gives us a probability of $\\dfrac{925}{\\binom{28}{4}}=\\dfrac{925}{\\frac{28\\cdot27\\cdot26\\cdot25}{4\\cdot3\\cdot2}}=\\dfrac{925}{358800}=\\boxed{\\frac{25}{1008}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{1008}}$"
