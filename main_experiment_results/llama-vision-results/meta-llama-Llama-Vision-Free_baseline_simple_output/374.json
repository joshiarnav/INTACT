    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are given the expression $\\dbinom{16}{4}-\\dbinom{16}{12}$ to compute, which involves combinations.\n## Step 2:  The first step is to understand what the expression represents. $\\dbinom{n}{r}$ represents the number of ways to choose $r$ elements from a set of $n$ elements, and is calculated using the formula $\\dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$.\n## Step 3:  We can simplify the given expression using Pascal's identity, which states that $\\dbinom{n}{r} = \\dbinom{n-1}{r-1} + \\dbinom{n-1}{r}$.\n## Step 4:  Applying Pascal's identity, we can rewrite $\\dbinom{16}{4}$ as $\\dbinom{15}{4} + \\dbinom{15}{3}$.\n## Step 5:  Similarly, we can rewrite $\\dbinom{16}{12}$ as $\\dbinom{15}{12} + \\dbinom{15}{11}$.\n## Step 6:  By substituting these expressions back into the original expression, we get $\\dbinom{15}{4} + \\dbinom{15}{3} - \\dbinom{15}{12} - \\dbinom{15}{11}$.\n## Step 7:  We can further simplify this by applying Pascal's identity again to express $\\dbinom{15}{4}$ and $\\dbinom{15}{3}$ in terms of $\\dbinom{14}{4}$, $\\dbinom{14}{3}$, $\\dbinom{14}{2}$, and $\\dbinom{14}{1}$.\n## Step 8:  Similarly, we can express $\\dbinom{15}{12}$ and $\\dbinom{15}{11}$ in terms of $\\dbinom{14}{12}$, $\\dbinom{14}{11}$, $\\dbinom{14}{10}$, and $\\dbinom{14}{9}$.\n## Step 9:  Simplifying these expressions, we find that $\\dbinom{15}{4} + \\dbinom{15}{3} - \\dbinom{15}{12} - \\dbinom{15}{11} = \\dbinom{14}{4} + \\dbinom{14}{3} + \\dbinom{14}{2} + \\dbinom{14}{1} - (\\dbinom{14}{12} + \\dbinom{14}{11} + \\dbinom{14}{10} + \\dbinom{14}{9})$.\n## Step 10:  To simplify this further, we can apply Pascal's identity one more time to find that $\\dbinom{14}{4} + \\dbinom{14}{3} + \\dbinom{14}{2} + \\dbinom{14}{1} = \\dbinom{14}{4}$ and $\\dbinom{14}{12} + \\dbinom{14}{11} + \\dbinom{14}{10} + \\dbinom{14}{9} = \\dbinom{14}{4}$.\n## Step 11:  Thus, the given expression simplifies to $\\dbinom{14}{4} - \\dbinom{14}{4}$.\n## Step 12:  Since $\\dbinom{14}{4}$ and $\\dbinom{14}{4}$ are the same value, their difference is $0$.\n## Step 13:  Therefore, the final result of the expression $\\dbinom{16}{4}-\\dbinom{16}{12}$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"
