    "problem": "In how many ways can we seat 6 people at a round table if John and Sam insist on sitting next to each other? (Two seatings are equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "To take care of rotations, we can fix John at the topmost seat.  We then have two choices for Sam: either side of John. The other four may sit anywhere in the other four seats. Thus there are $2\\times 4! = \\boxed{48}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Consider John and Sam as a single entity\nSince John and Sam insist on sitting next to each other, we can treat them as a single entity for the purpose of seating arrangements. This effectively reduces the number of individuals to be seated from 6 to 5.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to arrange 5 entities around a round table\nFor seating arrangements around a round table, each position is considered unique only if it's not a rotation of the previous arrangement. There are 4 unique positions around a round table for 5 entities. This is because the first person can sit in any of the 5 positions, but the rest of the arrangements are considered the same if they are rotations of each other. The number of ways to arrange 5 entities around a round table is (5-1)!, which is 4!.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways John and Sam can sit next to each other within their entity\nWithin their entity, John and Sam can sit in two different orders: John on the left and Sam on the right, or Sam on the left and John on the right.\n\n## Step 4: Multiply the number of ways to arrange the 5 entities by the number of ways John and Sam can sit next to each other\nThe total number of ways to seat the 6 people at a round table with John and Sam sitting next to each other is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 5 entities around a round table (calculated in Step 2) and the number of ways John and Sam can sit next to each other within their entity (calculated in Step 3).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the final number of arrangements\nThe total number of arrangements is 4! * 2.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the value of 4!\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n\n## Step 7: Multiply 4! by 2\n24 * 2 = 48.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{48}$"
