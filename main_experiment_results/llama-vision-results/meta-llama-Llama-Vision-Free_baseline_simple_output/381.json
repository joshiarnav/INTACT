    "problem": "How many distinct three-letter sequences with at least one $``T\"$ can be formed by using three of the six letters of $TARGET?$ One such sequence is $``T-R-T.\"$",
    "solution": "We solve by casework.\n\n$\\bullet$ Case I: Exactly one T in the sequence. There are $3$ slots in which the $T$ could be placed. Then, there are $4$ choices $(A,$ $R,$ $G,$ or $E)$ for the second slot and $3$ for the third, giving a total of $3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = 36$ sequences.\n\n$\\bullet$ Case II: Exactly two Ts in the sequence. There are $3$ slots in which the non-$T$ can be placed, and there are $4$ possibilities for the letter choice. So, there are a total of $3 \\cdot 4 = 12$ such sequences.\n\nThus, there are $36 + 12 = \\boxed{48}$ possible sequences.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, let's calculate the total number of distinct three-letter sequences that can be formed using the six letters of \"TARGET\" without any restrictions.\nThere are 6 options for the first letter, 6 options for the second letter, and 6 options for the third letter. Therefore, the total number of distinct three-letter sequences without any restrictions is $6\\times6\\times6=216.$\n\n## Step 2: Now, let's calculate the number of distinct three-letter sequences that can be formed using the six letters of \"TARGET\" with no \"T\"s.\nThere are 4 options for the first letter, 4 options for the second letter, and 4 options for the third letter. Therefore, the total number of distinct three-letter sequences with no \"T\"s is $4\\times4\\times4=64.$\n\n## Step 3: To find the number of distinct three-letter sequences with at least one \"T\", we subtract the number of distinct three-letter sequences with no \"T\"s from the total number of distinct three-letter sequences without any restrictions.\nNumber of sequences with at least one \"T\" = Total number of sequences - Number of sequences with no \"T\"s\n\n## Step 4: Plug in the numbers into the equation.\nNumber of sequences with at least one \"T\" = $216 - 64 = 152.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{152}$"
