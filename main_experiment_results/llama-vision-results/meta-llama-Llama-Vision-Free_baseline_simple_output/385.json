    "problem": "A regular dodecahedron is a convex polyhedron with 12 regular pentagonal faces and 20 vertices.  If two distinct vertices are chosen at random, what is the probability that the line connecting them lies inside the dodecahedron?",
    "solution": "There are a total of $\\dbinom{20}{2}=190$ ways to choose two distinct vertices.  When the line is drawn connecting these vertices, some will correspond to edges or face diagonals, and the rest will lie inside the dodecahedron. Each of the 12 pentagonal faces has 5 edges.  This makes a total of $5\\cdot12=60$ edges.  This counts each edge twice, once for each adjacent face, so there are only $60/2=30$ edges.  Each of the 12 pentagonal faces also has $5$ face diagonals.  This can be seen by drawing out an example, or remembering that an $n$ sided polygon has $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$ face diagonals.  This is a total of $5\\cdot 12= 60$ face diagonals.\n\nTherefore, of the 190 ways to choose two vertices, $190-30-60=100$ will give lines that lie inside the dodecahedron when connected.  The probability of selecting such a pair is then: $$\\frac{100}{190}=\\boxed{\\frac{10}{19}}$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of a regular dodecahedron. It has 12 regular pentagonal faces and 20 vertices.\n## Step 2:  We are asked to find the probability that the line connecting two distinct randomly chosen vertices lies inside the dodecahedron.\n## Step 3:  The total number of ways to choose 2 vertices from 20 is given by the combination formula $\\binom{20}{2} = 190$.\n## Step 4:  Next, we need to determine the number of pairs of vertices that lie on the same pentagon. Each pentagon has 5 vertices, so there are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ pairs of vertices that lie on the same pentagon.\n## Step 5:  Additionally, we need to consider the pairs of vertices that lie on the same edge. Each pentagon has 5 edges, and each edge connects 2 vertices. Since there are 12 pentagons, there are 12 edges per pentagon, but each edge is counted twice, so the total number of edges is 30. Therefore, there are 30 pairs of vertices that lie on the same edge.\n## Step 6:  However, we have counted the pairs of vertices that lie on the same edge twice, so we need to subtract 30 from the total number of pairs of vertices that lie on the same pentagon or edge.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the total number of pairs of vertices that lie on the same pentagon or edge is $12 \\times 10 - 30 = 90$.\n## Step 8:  Now, we can calculate the probability that a randomly chosen pair of vertices does not lie on the same pentagon or edge. This is given by $\\frac{190-90}{190}=\\frac{100}{190}=\\frac{10}{19}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{10}{19}}$"
