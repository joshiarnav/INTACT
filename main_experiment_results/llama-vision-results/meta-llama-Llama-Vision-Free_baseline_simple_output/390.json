    "solution": "It takes 2 additional segments to create an additional triangle after the first. Since Figure $n$ has $n$ triangles, Figure 25 has 25 triangles. It takes 3 segments to create the first triangle and $2\\cdot24=48$ segments to create the 24 additional triangles, for a total of $3+48=\\boxed{51}$ segments.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find out how many congruent segments are needed to make Figure 25 of the sequence, we need to understand the pattern of segment usage as the figures progress.\n## Step 2:  Looking at Figure 1, it consists of 3 segments, forming one equilateral triangle. Figure 2 contains 6 segments, forming 2 equilateral triangles. Figure 3, with 7 segments, forms 3 equilateral triangles.\n## Step 3:  It's noticeable that each figure contains one more triangle than the preceding figure, and the number of segments in each figure is one more than the number of triangles.\n## Step 4:  This means that Figure 4 would have 10 segments, forming 4 equilateral triangles.\n## Step 5:  From this pattern, we can infer that each subsequent figure requires one more segment than the previous figure.\n## Step 6:  So, to determine the number of segments needed for Figure 25, we can simply add 1 to the number of triangles in Figure 24.\n## Step 7:  Figure 24 will have 24 equilateral triangles, so the total number of segments required for Figure 25 will be 24 + 1 = 25.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, Figure 25 will require $\\boxed{25}$ congruent segments.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{25}$"
