    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the next number in the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1 and then 10, we must first understand the pattern of Pascal's triangle.\n## Step 2:  Each number in Pascal's triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The first and last numbers in each row are always 1.\n## Step 3:  The row in question corresponds to the binomial coefficients of the expansion of $(a+b)^{10}$.\n## Step 4:  The binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$ is given by $\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n!$ denotes the factorial of $n$.\n## Step 5:  The numbers in the row starting with 1 and then 10 correspond to $\\binom{10}{0}$, $\\binom{10}{1}$, $\\binom{10}{2}$, and so on.\n## Step 6:  The next number in the row is $\\binom{10}{2}$, which is given by $\\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the next number in the row of Pascal's triangle is $45$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{45}$"
