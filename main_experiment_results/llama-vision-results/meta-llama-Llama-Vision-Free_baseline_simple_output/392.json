    "problem": "Randy presses RAND on his calculator twice to obtain two random numbers between 0 and 1. Let $p$ be the probability that these two numbers and 1 form the sides of an obtuse triangle.  Find $4p$.",
    "solution": "Let the two random numbers be $x$ and $y$. In order to form an obtuse triangle, since 1 will be the longest side, we must simultaneously satisfy the following inequalities: $$x+y>1\\text{ and }x^2+y^2<1.$$The first is the triangle inequality and the second guarantees that the triangle is obtuse. Graphing these in the $xy$-plane, we get the following shaded region. [asy]\ndraw(unitsquare);\ndraw((0,0)--(1,0),EndArrow);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,1),EndArrow);\nlabel(\"0\",(0,0),SW);\nlabel(\"1\",(1,0),S);\nlabel(\"1\",(0,1),W);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,.5),W);\nfill((1,0)--(0,1)..(3/5,4/5)..cycle,gray(.7));\n[/asy] The curve is an arc of the unit circle centered at the origin. This area is then equal to that sector minus the right isosceles triangle within it, or $\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{\\pi-2}{4}.$ And since the area of the square is $1,$ $p = \\frac{\\pi-2}{4}.$\n\nFour times $p$ is $\\boxed{\\pi-2}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are tasked with finding the probability that two randomly generated numbers between 0 and 1, along with the number 1, can form the sides of an obtuse triangle.\n## Step 2:  We know that an obtuse triangle has one obtuse angle, which occurs when the square of the longest side is greater than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n## Step 3:  Let's consider the possible scenarios for the two generated numbers, $x$ and $y$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x < y$.\n## Step 4:  We can then visualize the possible range of values for $x$ and $y$ in the $xy$-coordinate system, where $x$ ranges from 0 to 1 and $y$ ranges from $x$ to 1.\n## Step 5:  To form an obtuse triangle with sides $x$, $y$, and 1, we must have $1^2 > x^2 + y^2$. This inequality simplifies to $y^2 > 1 - x^2$.\n## Step 6:  In the $xy$-coordinate system, the region that satisfies $y^2 > 1 - x^2$ can be geometrically represented by the area below the curve $y = \\sqrt{1-x^2}$, which is the upper half of the unit circle centered at the origin.\n## Step 7:  By analyzing the region, we observe that the area where $x$ and $y$ satisfy $y^2 > 1 - x^2$ forms a quarter circle with a radius of 1, minus the area of a right triangle with sides 1 and 1.\n## Step 8:  The total area of the region where $x$ and $y$ satisfy the inequality is $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi - \\frac{1}{2}$.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the probability $p$ can be calculated as the ratio of the area of the shaded region to the total area, which is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{4}\\pi - \\frac{1}{2}}{1} = \\frac{1}{4}\\pi - \\frac{1}{2}$.\n## Step 10:  Finally, to find $4p$, we multiply the value of $p$ by 4, giving us $4p = 4(\\frac{1}{4}\\pi - \\frac{1}{2})$.\n## Step 11:  Simplifying this expression, we get $4p = \\pi - 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\pi - 2}$"
