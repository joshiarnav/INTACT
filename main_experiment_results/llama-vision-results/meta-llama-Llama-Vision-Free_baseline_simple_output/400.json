    "problem": "I have a spinner that lands on 1 with a probability of $\\frac{1}{10}$, 2 with a probability of $\\frac{2}{10}$, 3 with a probability of $\\frac{3}{10}$, and 4 with a probability of $\\frac{4}{10}$. If Phil and Sarah both spin the spinner, what is the probability that they get the same number?",
    "solution": "This problem requires a little bit of casework.  There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's. The probability of getting a 1 is $\\dfrac{1}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 1 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{100}$. Similarly, the probability of getting a 2 is $\\dfrac{2}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 2 is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{100}$, the probability of getting a 3 is $\\dfrac{3}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 3 is $\\left(\\dfrac{3}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{9}{100}$ and the probability of getting a 4 is $\\dfrac{4}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 4 is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{16}{100}$. So our answer is $\\dfrac{1}{100}+\\dfrac{4}{100}+\\dfrac{9}{100}+\\dfrac{16}{100}=\\frac{30}{100}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the probability that Phil and Sarah get the same number on the spinner, we must first consider all the possible outcomes when both spin the spinner.\n## Step 2:  The spinner has four numbers, so there are a total of $4 \\times 4 = 16$ possible outcomes.\n## Step 3:  We can calculate the probability of each outcome by multiplying the probability of each number on the spinner.\n## Step 4:  The probability of both Phil and Sarah getting 1 is $\\frac{1}{10}\\times\\frac{1}{10}=\\frac{1}{100}$.\n## Step 5:  The probability of both getting 2 is $\\frac{2}{10}\\times\\frac{2}{10}=\\frac{4}{100}$.\n## Step 6:  The probability of both getting 3 is $\\frac{3}{10}\\times\\frac{3}{10}=\\frac{9}{100}$.\n## Step 7:  The probability of both getting 4 is $\\frac{4}{10}\\times\\frac{4}{10}=\\frac{16}{100}$.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the total probability that they get the same number is $\\frac{1}{100}+\\frac{4}{100}+\\frac{9}{100}+\\frac{16}{100}=\\frac{30}{100}=\\frac{3}{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$"
