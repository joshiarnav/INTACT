    "solution": "To find the coefficient of $x^2y^2$, we can find the coefficient in each of the 4th powers. These are the only things that can contribute $x^2y^2$ terms to the final expansion.\n\nThe expansion of $(x+y)^4$ will have a coefficient of $\\binom{4}{2}$ for $x^2y^2$, by the Binomial Theorem.\n\nThe expansion of $(x+2y)^4$ will have a coefficient of $2^2\\binom{4}{2}$ for $x^2y^2$.\n\nThus the coefficient of $x^2y^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^4+(x+2y)^4$ will be $\\binom{4}{2}+4\\binom{4}{2}=\\boxed{30}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the coefficient of $x^2y^2$, we first need to understand how the expansion of a binomial raised to a power works.\n## Step 2:  We're given the expression $(x+y)^4+(x+2y)^4$, and we're interested in the term $x^2y^2$.\n## Step 3:  Using the Binomial Theorem, we can expand each of the individual expressions and then combine like terms.\n## Step 4:  The Binomial Theorem states that $(a+b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k}b^k$, where $\\binom{n}{k}$ represents the binomial coefficient.\n## Step 5:  For the first expression, $(x+y)^4$, applying the Binomial Theorem, we get $x^4+4x^3y+6x^2y^2+4xy^3+y^4$.\n## Step 6:  Similarly, for the second expression, $(x+2y)^4$, applying the Binomial Theorem, we get $x^4+8x^3y+24x^2y^2+32xy^3+16y^4$.\n## Step 7:  To find the coefficient of $x^2y^2$ in the expanded form of the given expression, we need to look at the corresponding term in the expansion of both expressions and add them together.\n## Step 8:  From the first expression, the term corresponding to $x^2y^2$ is $6x^2y^2$.\n## Step 9:  From the second expression, the term corresponding to $x^2y^2$ is $24x^2y^2$.\n## Step 10:  Adding these terms together, we get $6x^2y^2+24x^2y^2$.\n## Step 11:  Combining like terms, we obtain $30x^2y^2$.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, the coefficient of $x^2y^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^4+(x+2y)^4$ is $30$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$"
