    "problem": "Phillip flips an unfair coin eight times. This coin is twice as likely to come up heads as tails. How many times as likely is Phillip to get exactly three heads than exactly two heads?",
    "solution": "The probability that Phillip flips $k$ heads is $$\\binom8k\\left(\\frac23\\right)^k\\left(\\frac13\\right)^{8-k}=\\frac1{3^8}\\binom8k2^k,$$  since there are $\\binom{8}{k}$ ways that $k$ out of $8$ coins will come up heads, and each of these arrangements of $k$ heads out of $8$ coins occurs with probability $\\left(\\frac23\\right)^k\\left(\\frac13\\right)^{8-k}$.   Therefore, the ratio of the two probabilities in the problem is equal to $$\\frac{\\binom832^3}{\\binom822^2}=\\frac{8\\cdot7\\cdot6}{3\\cdot2\\cdot1}\\cdot\\frac{2\\cdot1}{8\\cdot7}\\cdot\\frac{2^3}{2^2}=\\frac{6}{3}\\cdot2=\\boxed{4}.$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the probability of getting heads and tails for one flip.\nLet's denote the probability of getting heads as P(H) and the probability of getting tails as P(T). Since the coin is twice as likely to come up heads as tails, we can express this as P(H) = 2P(T). Given that the sum of probabilities for all outcomes is 1, we have P(H) + P(T) = 1. Substituting P(H) = 2P(T) gives us 2P(T) + P(T) = 1, which simplifies to 3P(T) = 1. Therefore, P(T) = 1/3, and P(H) = 2/3.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of getting exactly three heads in eight flips.\nThe probability of getting exactly three heads in eight flips can be calculated using the binomial probability formula P(X = k) = C(n, k) * P^k * (1-P)^(n-k), where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successful outcomes, C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\", P is the probability of success on a single trial, and (1-P) is the probability of failure on a single trial. In this case, n = 8, k = 3, P(H) = 2/3, and (1-P(H)) = 1/3. Therefore, the probability of getting exactly three heads is P(X = 3) = C(8, 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^5.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of getting exactly two heads in eight flips.\nSimilarly, the probability of getting exactly two heads in eight flips is P(X = 2) = C(8, 2) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^6.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the binomial coefficients C(8, 3) and C(8, 2).\nC(n, k) can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial. Therefore, C(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 8! / (3!5!) = 56, and C(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 8! / (2!6!) = 28.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute the binomial coefficients and probabilities into the formulas for P(X = 3) and P(X = 2).\nP(X = 3) = 56 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^5 = 56 * 8/27 * 1/243 = 56 * 8 / 6561 = 448/6561. P(X = 2) = 28 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^6 = 28 * 4/9 * 1/729 = 28 * 4 / 6561 = 112/6561.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the ratio of P(X = 3) to P(X = 2) to find how many times as likely Phillip is to get exactly three heads than exactly two heads.\nThe ratio of P(X = 3) to P(X = 2) is (448/6561) / (112/6561) = 448/112 = 4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
