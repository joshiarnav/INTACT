    "problem": "Bob and Alice each have a bag that contains one ball of each of the colors,  blue, green, orange, red, and violet. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Bob then randomly selects one ball from his bag and  puts it into Alice's bag. What is the probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same?",
    "solution": "After Alice puts the ball into Bob's bag, his bag will contain six balls: two of one color and one of each of the other colors. After Bob selects a ball and places it into Alice's bag, the two bags will have the same contents if and only if Bob picked one of the two balls in his bag that are the same color. Because there are six balls in the bag when Bob makes his selection, the probability of selecting one of the same colored pair is $2/6=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We first need to understand the process and the possible outcomes when Alice and Bob each select a ball and then exchange them between their bags.\n## Step 2:  There are a total of 5 colors of balls, and each bag starts with one ball of each of these colors.\n## Step 3:  When Alice selects a ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag, there are 5 possible balls she can choose from.\n## Step 4:  After Alice's selection, Bob then selects one ball from his bag and puts it into Alice's bag. Again, there are 5 possible balls Bob can choose from.\n## Step 5:  We are interested in finding the probability that after this process, the contents of the two bags are the same. This means that after the exchanges, each bag will contain one ball of each of the 5 colors, except for the one color that was swapped between them.\n## Step 6:  We can approach this problem by calculating the probability of the complementary event, i.e., the probability that the bags do not end up with the same contents, and then subtracting it from 1 to get the desired probability.\n## Step 7:  If the bags do not end up with the same contents, it means that the two balls that were swapped between the bags are different colors. This can occur in 4 ways: blue and green, blue and orange, blue and red, blue and violet, green and orange, green and red, green and violet, orange and red, orange and violet, and red and violet.\n## Step 8:  However, we can simplify this problem by considering the swapping of balls as a combination, which leads to $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ possible ways to choose the two balls that will be swapped.\n## Step 9:  Out of these 10 possible ways, 4 result in the bags having different contents, as mentioned earlier.\n## Step 10:  This gives us a probability of $\\frac{4}{10}=\\frac{2}{5}$ that the bags do not end up with the same contents.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the probability that the bags do end up with the same contents is $1-\\frac{2}{5}=\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$"
