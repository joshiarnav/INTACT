    "problem": "Suppose that we win $\\$2$ if we flip a heads on a coin toss, but lose $\\$1$ if we flip tails.  What is the expected value, in dollars, of our winnings after one flip?",
    "solution": "In one flip, we have a $1/2$ chance of getting heads and winning 2 dollars, and a $1/2$ chance of getting tails and losing 1 dollar.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\$2) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\$1) = \\boxed{\\$0.50}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, let's understand the question and what is being asked. We are dealing with a situation where we win $\\$2$ if we flip heads on a coin toss, but lose $\\$1$ if we flip tails.\n## Step 2:  Now, we need to find the expected value of our winnings after one flip. The expected value is the average value we expect to get if we repeated the experiment many times.\n## Step 3:  There are two possible outcomes of a coin flip: heads and tails. We have a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance of flipping heads and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance of flipping tails.\n## Step 4:  In the case of flipping heads, our winnings are $\\$2$. In the case of flipping tails, our winnings are $-\\$1$.\n## Step 5:  To find the expected value, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by the value of that outcome and then add these products together.\n## Step 6:  So, we have $\\frac{1}{2}\\times2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\times(-1)$.\n## Step 7:  Simplifying this expression gives us $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{-1}{2}$.\n## Step 8:  Combining the fractions, we get $\\frac{1-1}{2}$.\n## Step 9:  This simplifies to $\\frac{0}{2}$, which equals $\\$0$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the expected value of our winnings after one flip is $\\$0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"
