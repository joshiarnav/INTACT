    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the range of integers to check.\nWe are looking for integers between 200 and 300, so we need to check integers in this range.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the range of possible square roots.\nTo find the perfect squares within the given range, we need to determine the square roots of the endpoints of the range. The square root of 200 is approximately 14.14, and the square root of 300 is approximately 17.32.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the integers that are square roots within the range.\nSince we are looking for integers that are square roots, we need to round up the lower bound and round down the upper bound. The smallest integer greater than 14.14 is 15, and the largest integer less than 17.32 is 17.\n\n## Step 4: Count the number of integers within the range that are square roots.\nWe have the integers 15, 16, and 17 as the possible square roots within the range.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of perfect squares between 200 and 300.\nSince the square of each identified integer is a perfect square, we need to calculate the squares of these integers and count how many are within the given range. 15^2 = 225, 16^2 = 256, and 17^2 = 289. All of these are between 200 and 300.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the total count of perfect squares.\nWe have 3 integers within the range that are square roots, and the squares of these integers are all within the given range.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
