    "problem": "Morgan has 3 hockey shirts, 2 football shirts and 7 baseball shirts in her closet. If she randomly selects one of these shirts, what is the probability that it will not be a baseball shirt? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are $3+2 + 7 =12$ shirts to choose from. A total of $2+3 = 5$ of these, all the hockey and football shirts, are not baseball shirts. So, the probability of not getting a baseball shirt is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{12}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the probability that the randomly selected shirt is not a baseball shirt, we first need to determine the total number of shirts Morgan has.\n## Step 2:  Morgan has 3 hockey shirts, 2 football shirts, and 7 baseball shirts in her closet, making a total of $3 + 2 + 7 = 12$ shirts.\n## Step 3:  The probability of the event not happening is given by 1 minus the probability of the event happening.\n## Step 4:  In this case, the event is selecting a baseball shirt, so the probability of not selecting a baseball shirt is $1 - P(\\text{baseball shirt})$.\n## Step 5:  The probability of selecting a baseball shirt is the number of baseball shirts divided by the total number of shirts, which is $\\frac{7}{12}$.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the probability of not selecting a baseball shirt is $1 - \\frac{7}{12} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{12}}$"
