    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are distinguishable and the boxes are distinguishable?",
    "solution": "There are 3 different boxes, so each of the 5 balls can be placed in three different locations.  So the answer is $3^5 = \\boxed{243}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Since both the balls and boxes are distinguishable, we can use the concept of choices with repetitions for each ball.\n## Step 2:  For each of the 5 balls, there are 3 choices of boxes where it can be placed.\n## Step 3:  This means that for each ball, there are 3 options, and since the choice for each ball is independent of the others, we can use the multiplication principle.\n## Step 4:  The multiplication principle states that if there are $a$ ways to do one thing and $b$ ways to do another thing, then there are $a \\cdot b$ ways to do both things.\n## Step 5:  Applying this principle to our situation, we have $3$ choices for each of the 5 balls, so the total number of ways to put the balls in the boxes is $3^5$.\n## Step 6:  This is because each of the 5 balls can be placed in any of the 3 boxes, giving us $3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ ways in total.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, there are $3^5 = 243$ ways to put 5 distinguishable balls in 3 distinguishable boxes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{243}$"
