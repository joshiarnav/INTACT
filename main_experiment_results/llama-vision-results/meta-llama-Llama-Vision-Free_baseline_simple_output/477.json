    "problem": "In how many ways can 8 people sit around a round table if Pierre and Thomas want to sit together, but Rosa doesn't want to sit next to either of them? (Treat rotations as not distinct but reflections as distinct.)",
    "solution": "Solution 1: We choose any seat for Pierre, and then seat everyone else relative to Pierre.  There are 2 choices for Thomas; to the right or left of Pierre.  Then, there are 4 possible seats for Rosa that aren't adjacent to Pierre or Thomas. The five remaining people can be arranged in any of $5!$ ways, so there are a total of $2\\cdot 4\\cdot 5!=960$ valid ways to arrange the people around the table.\n\nSolution 2: The total number of ways in which Pierre and Thomas sit together is $6! \\cdot 2 = 1440$. The number of ways in which Pierre and Thomas sit together and Rosa sits next to one of them is $5! \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 480$. So the answer is the difference $1440 - 480 = \\boxed{960}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, we need to consider the constraint that Pierre and Thomas want to sit together, but Rosa doesn't want to sit next to either of them. We can start by treating Pierre and Thomas as a single unit, which allows us to simplify the problem.\n## Step 2:  Now, we have 7 \"people\" to arrange around the round table: the unit of Pierre and Thomas, and the 5 other individuals, including Rosa.\n## Step 3:  Since rotations are considered not distinct, we fix the unit of Pierre and Thomas in one position to avoid counting rotations as distinct arrangements.\n## Step 4:  We can arrange the 6 \"people\" in 6! ways around the table.\n## Step 5:  However, within the unit of Pierre and Thomas, there are 2 ways to arrange them. Therefore, we have 2 * 6! ways to arrange the 6 \"people\".\n## Step 6:  Next, we need to remove the cases where Rosa is sitting next to Pierre or Thomas. We can consider these cases separately to ensure we're not counting them.\n## Step 7:  If Rosa sits next to Pierre, we can treat Rosa, Pierre, and Thomas as a single unit, and we have 5 \"people\" to arrange around the table, which can be done in 5! ways.\n## Step 8:  Similarly, if Rosa sits next to Thomas, we can treat Rosa, Thomas, and Pierre as a single unit, and we have 5 \"people\" to arrange around the table, which can be done in 5! ways.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the round table, considering the given constraints, is 2 * 6! - 2 * 5!.\n## Step 10:  Substituting the factorial values, we get 2 * 720 - 2 * 120.\n## Step 11:  Simplifying, we have 1440 - 240.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the round table is 1200.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1200}$"
