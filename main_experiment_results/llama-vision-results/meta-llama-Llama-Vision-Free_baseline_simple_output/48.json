    "problem": "Krishanu and Shaunak each pick an integer at random between 1 and 10, inclusive. What is the probability that the product of their numbers is more than 10? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Since 10 is small for a product, we consider the complementary probability, that their product is at most 10. To do this, we count the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ with $mn\\le10$ ($m$ is Krishanu's number and $n$ is Shaunak's number). If $m=1$, there are 10 such pairs; if $m=2$, there are 5; if $m=3$ there are 3; if $m=4$ or $m=5$, there are 2, and if $m=6,7,8,9,10$ there is 1, for a total of $$10+5+3+2+2+1+1+1+1+1=27$$ordered pairs with product at most 10. The probability one of these is picked is then $27/100$, since there are $10\\cdot10=100$ possible ordered pairs. Therefore, the probability that the product of their numbers is greater than 10 is $1-27/100=\\boxed{\\frac{73}{100}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the possible outcomes for both Krishanu and Shaunak's picks.\nKrishanu and Shaunak can each pick an integer between 1 and 10, inclusive. This means each of them has 10 possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the total number of possible combinations of their picks.\nSince both Krishanu and Shaunak have 10 possible outcomes, the total number of combinations is 10 * 10 = 100.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the combinations where the product is more than 10.\nTo have a product greater than 10, at least one of the numbers picked must be greater than 1, and the other number must be greater than 1 as well. However, there's an exception: if one picks 10 and the other picks a number greater than 1, it also satisfies the condition.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of combinations where the product is not more than 10.\nThe combinations where the product is not more than 10 include:\n- Both picking 1.\n- One picks 1 and the other picks 2 through 10.\n- Both pick 2 through 9.\n- One picks 10 and the other picks 1.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of combinations where both pick 1.\nThe number of combinations where both pick 1 is 1.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of combinations where one picks 1 and the other picks 2 through 10.\nThere are 9 choices for the number that is not 1. Since this can happen in two ways (either Krishanu picks 1 and Shaunak picks a different number, or Shaunak picks 1 and Krishanu picks a different number), the total number of combinations in this case is 9 * 2 = 18.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of combinations where both pick 2 through 9.\nThere are 9 choices for the numbers that are not 1 or 10. Since both numbers must be chosen from these 9 options, the total number of combinations in this case is 9 * 9 = 81.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the number of combinations where one picks 10 and the other picks 1.\nThere is 1 combination where one person picks 10 and the other picks 1.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the total number of combinations where the product is not more than 10.\n1 (both pick 1) + 18 (one picks 1, the other picks 2-10) + 81 (both pick 2-9) + 1 (one picks 10, the other picks 1) = 101.\n\n## Step 10: However, this is incorrect. Since one of the combinations counted in step 9 is (1,10) which does satisfy the condition for product>10, this should not be included in the count of the product <= 10 combinations. This results in a total number of combinations where the product is not more than 10 to be recalculated.\nLet's correct the calculation:\n- There are indeed 1 combinations where both pick 1.\n- There are 9 choices for the number that is not 1. Since this can happen in two ways (either Krishanu picks 1 and Shaunak picks a different number, or Shaunak picks 1 and Krishanu picks a different number), the total number of combinations in this case is 9 * 2 = 18.\n- There are 9 choices for the numbers that are not 1 or 10. Since both numbers must be chosen from these 9 options, the total number of combinations in this case is 8 * 8 = 64.\n- There is 1 combination where one person picks 10 and the other picks 1, but this is indeed one of the products >10, so it should be counted as such.\n\n## Step 11: Recalculate the total number of combinations where the product is not more than 10.\n1 (both pick 1) + 18 (one picks 1, the other picks 2-10) + 64 (both pick 2-9) = 83.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the number of combinations where the product is more than 10.\nThe total number of combinations where the product is more than 10 is 100 - 83 = 17.\n\n## Step 13: Calculate the probability that the product of their numbers is more than 10.\nThe probability is the number of combinations where the product is more than 10 divided by the total number of combinations.\n\n## Step 14: Express the probability as a common fraction.\nProbability = 17 / 100\n\n## Step 15: Simplify the fraction.\nSince there are no common factors of 17 and 100, the fraction cannot be simplified.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{100}}$"
