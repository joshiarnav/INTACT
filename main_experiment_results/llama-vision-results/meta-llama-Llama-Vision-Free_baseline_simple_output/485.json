    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 4 balls in 3 boxes if two balls are indistinguishably green, two are indistinguishably red, and the boxes are distinguishable?",
    "solution": "We will consider this as a composite of two problems with two indistinguishable balls and 3 distinguishable boxes.  For two indistinguishable green balls, we can place the balls in a box together or in separate boxes.  There are $3$ options to arrange them together (in box 1, 2, or 3) and $3$ options for placing them separately (nothing in box 1, 2, or 3).  So there are 6 ways to arrange the indistinguishable green balls.  By the same reasoning, there are 6 ways to arrange the indistinguishable red balls, for a total of $6 \\times 6 = \\boxed{36}$ arrangements of the 4 balls.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of ways to distribute the 4 balls (2 green and 2 red) into the 3 distinguishable boxes.\n## Step 2:  Since the boxes are distinguishable, we can approach this problem by considering the number of ways to select the boxes for the 2 green balls and then the number of ways to select the boxes for the 2 red balls.\n## Step 3:  First, let's consider the 2 green balls. We can choose 2, 1, or 0 boxes for the green balls. The number of ways to choose 2 boxes for the green balls is ${3\\choose 2}=3$. This is because we have 3 options (boxes 1, 2, or 3) and we need to choose 2 of them. Similarly, the number of ways to choose 1 box for the green balls is ${3\\choose 1}=3$ and the number of ways to choose 0 boxes for the green balls is ${3\\choose 0}=1$.\n## Step 4:  Now, for the 2 red balls, we have the same options: choose 2, 1, or 0 boxes. However, we need to ensure that the green and red balls are distributed in a way that each box contains at most 2 balls.\n## Step 5:  If we choose 2 boxes for the green balls, then the 2 red balls must go in the remaining box. The number of ways to choose 2 boxes for the green balls and 1 box for the red balls is ${3\\choose 2}\\cdot {1\\choose 1}=3$.\n## Step 6:  If we choose 1 box for the green balls, then the 2 red balls must go in the other 2 boxes. The number of ways to choose 1 box for the green balls and 2 boxes for the red balls is ${3\\choose 1}\\cdot {2\\choose 2}=3$.\n## Step 7:  If we choose 0 boxes for the green balls, then the 2 red balls must go in 1 of the 3 boxes and the 2 green balls go in the remaining 2 boxes. The number of ways to choose 0 boxes for the green balls and 1 box for the red balls is ${3\\choose 0}\\cdot {2\\choose 1}=3$.\n## Step 8:  By summing up these cases, we get a total of $3+3+3=9$ ways to distribute the 4 balls into the 3 distinguishable boxes.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, there are 9 ways to put 4 balls in 3 boxes if two balls are indistinguishably green, two are indistinguishably red, and the boxes are distinguishable.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$"
