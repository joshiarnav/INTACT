    "problem": "How many integers are there on the number line between $\\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$?",
    "solution": "Because 17 is between $5\\times3=15$ and $6\\times 3 = 18$, we know that $\\dfrac{17}{3}$ is somewhere between $5$ and $6$. Since $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{17^2}{3^2}=\\dfrac{289}{9}$, we see that 289 is between $32\\times9=288$ and $33\\times9=297$ and thus that $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$ is between 32 and 33. Therefore, the integers from 6 to 32, inclusive, lie between $\\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\\left(\\dfrac{17}{3}\\right)^2$ on the number line, for a total of $32-6+1=\\boxed{27}$ integers.",
