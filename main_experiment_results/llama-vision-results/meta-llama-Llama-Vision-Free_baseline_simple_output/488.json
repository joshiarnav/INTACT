    "problem": "How many ways are there to put five beads on a necklace if there are eight distinct beads to choose from, and rotations and reflections of the necklace are considered the same?",
    "solution": "Not considering rotations and reflections, there are 8 ways to choose the first bead to put on the necklace, followed by 7, 6, 5, and 4 ways to choose the next beads. For each arrangements of beads on the necklace, there are 5 ways to rotate it and another 5 ways to reflect it and then rotate it to another arrangement. Thus, arrangements of beads on the necklace come in groups of 10 equivalent arrangements. The total number of different arrangements is therefore $8\\cdot7\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot4/10=\\boxed{672}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the number of ways to put five beads on a necklace, we first consider the number of circular arrangements of the beads.\n## Step 2:  Since the beads are distinct and we need to find the number of ways to arrange 5 distinct beads in a circle, we can calculate this using the formula for permutations of n objects in a circle, which is $(n-1)!$.\n## Step 3:  Substituting $n = 5$ into the formula, we get $(5-1)! = 4! = 24$.\n## Step 4:  Now, we need to consider the symmetries of the necklace, which includes rotations and reflections.\n## Step 5:  Rotations of the necklace are considered the same, so we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of rotations that result in the same arrangement.\n## Step 6:  There are 5 rotations (0 degrees, 72 degrees, 144 degrees, 216 degrees, and 288 degrees) that result in the same arrangement.\n## Step 7:  Next, we consider the reflections of the necklace. Each arrangement has a reflection that is considered the same, so we divide the total number of arrangements by 2.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of the 5 beads on the necklace is $\\dfrac{24}{5 \\times 2} = \\dfrac{24}{10} = \\dfrac{12}{5}$.\n## Step 9:  However, we cannot have a fraction of arrangements, so we need to re-evaluate our approach to ensure we are considering all possible symmetries correctly.\n## Step 10:  We should consider the number of distinct arrangements when we have 5 identical beads, which is 1, and then multiply it by the number of ways to choose 5 beads out of 8 distinct beads, which is ${8 \\choose 5} = 56$.\n## Step 11:  However, this counts each arrangement 10 times (as there are 10 rotations of the circle), so we divide by 10.\n## Step 12:  After re-evaluating, we get $\\dfrac{56}{10} = \\dfrac{28}{5}$.\n## Step 13:  However, this is still a fractional number, indicating we need to re-examine our approach to ensure we are considering all symmetries correctly.\n## Step 14:  We should also consider that the necklace can be flipped over, which means we need to divide by 2 again to account for this symmetry.\n## Step 15:  After re-evaluating with the correct approach, we find that the total number of distinct arrangements of the 5 beads on the necklace is $\\dfrac{56}{10 \\times 2} = \\dfrac{28}{20} = \\dfrac{7}{5}$.\n## Step 16:  However, this is still a fractional number, so we need to re-consider the calculation for distinct arrangements when we have 5 identical beads and choose 5 beads out of 8 distinct beads.\n## Step 17:  We should count the distinct arrangements when we have 5 identical beads, which is 1, and then multiply it by the number of ways to choose 5 beads out of 8 distinct beads, which is ${8 \\choose 5} = 56$.\n## Step 18:  However, this counts each arrangement 10 times, so we divide by 10 to get $\\dfrac{56}{10} = \\dfrac{28}{5}$.\n## Step 19:  After re-evaluating, we find that the total number of distinct arrangements of the 5 beads on the necklace is actually $\\dfrac{56}{10}$.\n## Step 20:  However, we can further simplify this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.\n## Step 21:  We find that the greatest common divisor of 56 and 10 is 2, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2.\n## Step 22:  This gives us $\\dfrac{28}{5}$.\n## Step 23:  However, we cannot have a fractional number of arrangements, so we need to find the correct number of distinct arrangements.\n## Step 24:  The correct approach is to calculate the total number of arrangements and then divide by the number of rotations and reflections.\n## Step 25:  We can calculate the total number of arrangements using the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is $\\dfrac{n!}{(n-r)!}$.\n## Step 26:  In this case, we have 8 distinct beads and we need to choose 5 beads, so the total number of arrangements is $\\dfrac{8!}{(8-5)!} = \\dfrac{8!}{3!} = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 = 6720$.\n## Step 27:  However, this counts each arrangement 10 times (as there are 10 rotations of the circle), so we divide by 10.\n## Step 28:  We also need to consider the reflections of the necklace, which means we need to divide by 2 again.\n## Step 29:  After re-evaluating, we get $\\dfrac{6720}{10 \\times 2} = \\dfrac{6720}{20} = 336$.\n## Step 30:  Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of the 5 beads on the necklace is 336.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{336}$"
