    "problem": "An integer is randomly chosen from the integers 1 through 100, inclusive. What is the probability that the chosen integer is a perfect square or a perfect cube, but not both? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "A number is a perfect square and a perfect cube if and only if it is a perfect sixth power.  Note that $10^2 = 100$ and $4^3<100<5^3$, while $2^6 < 100 < 3^6 = 9^3$.  Hence, there are 10 squares and 4 cubes between 1 and 100, inclusive.  However, there are also 2 sixth powers, so when we add $10 + 4$ to count the number of squares and cubes, we count these sixth powers twice.  However, we don't want to count these sixth powers at all, so we must subtract them twice.  This gives us a total of $10 + 4 - 2\\cdot 2 = 10$ different numbers that are perfect squares or perfect cubes, but not both.  Thus, our probability is $\\frac{10}{100} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are tasked with finding the probability that a randomly chosen integer from 1 through 100, inclusive, is either a perfect square or a perfect cube, but not both.\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we need to first identify the perfect squares and perfect cubes within the range of 1 to 100.\n## Step 3:  The perfect squares in this range are $1^2=1,2^2=4,3^2=9,4^2=16,5^2=25,6^2=36,7^2=49,8^2=64,$ and $9^2=81$. There are a total of 9 perfect squares.\n## Step 4:  The perfect cubes in this range are $1^3=1,2^3=8,3^3=27,4^3=64,$ and $5^3=125$. However, we need to exclude $1$ and $64$ from the perfect cubes since they are also perfect squares. There are a total of 3 perfect cubes, excluding those that are also perfect squares.\n## Step 5:  Next, we need to find the total number of integers that are either a perfect square or a perfect cube, but not both. We do this by subtracting the intersection of the two sets from the total count of perfect squares and perfect cubes.\n## Step 6:  There are 9 perfect squares and 3 perfect cubes, with 2 numbers in the intersection (1 and 64). Therefore, the total number of integers that are either a perfect square or a perfect cube, but not both, is $9+3-2=10$.\n## Step 7:  Lastly, we calculate the probability by dividing the number of desired outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. The desired outcomes are the integers that are either a perfect square or a perfect cube, but not both, and the total possible outcomes are the integers between 1 and 100, inclusive.\n## Step 8:  The probability that the chosen integer is a perfect square or a perfect cube, but not both, is therefore $\\frac{10}{100}=\\frac{1}{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$"
