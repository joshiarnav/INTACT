    "problem": "I have four identical oranges. How many ways are there for me to divide these oranges into at most three groups?  (By definition, a group must have at least one orange.)",
    "solution": "All the oranges can go in one group, or $3$ can go in one group and $1$ in another group, or $2$ can go in one group and $2$ in another group, or $2$ can go in one group and each of the other $2$ can be in a group by itself.\n\nAs a list, we have: \\begin{align*}\n&4 \\\\\n&3,1\\\\\n&2,2\\\\\n&2,1,1.\n\\end{align*} This gives a total of $\\boxed{4}$ possibilities.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, let's consider the different possibilities for dividing the oranges into groups.\n## Step 2:  We have four identical oranges, and we want to find the number of ways to divide them into at most three groups.\n## Step 3:  One way to approach this problem is to list down the different possibilities and count them.\n## Step 4:  We can start by listing all the possible combinations: (4,0,0), (3,1,0), (2,2,0), (2,1,1).\n## Step 5:  It's essential to keep in mind that the groups are not labeled, so the order of the groups doesn't matter.\n## Step 6:  Now let's count the number of ways for each combination:\n## Step 7:  For (4,0,0), there is only 1 way.\n## Step 8:  For (3,1,0), there is also only 1 way.\n## Step 9:  For (2,2,0), there is only 1 way.\n## Step 10:  For (2,1,1), there is also only 1 way.\n## Step 11:  Now, let's add up the number of ways for each combination to find the total number of ways.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, the total number of ways for dividing the oranges into at most three groups is $1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = \\boxed{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
