    "problem": "The Senate has 100 members, 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats.  In how many ways can I choose a 5-person committee consisting of 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats?",
    "solution": "There are 55 ways to choose the first Republican, 54 ways to choose the second Republican, and 53 ways to choose the third Republican; however, we must divide by $3!$ because order does not matter.  So the number of ways to choose Republicans is $\\dfrac{55 \\times 54 \\times 53}{3!} = 26,\\!235$. There are 45 ways to choose the first Democrat and 44 ways to choose the second Democrat, but we must divide by $2!$ because order does not matter.  So the number of ways to choose the Democrats is $\\dfrac{45 \\times 44}{2!} = 990$.  So there are $26,\\!235 \\times 990 = \\boxed{25,\\!972,\\!650}$ ways to choose a committee.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 55 Republicans.\nTo calculate this, we will use the combination formula: $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Here, $n=55$ and $k=3$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of combinations for the Republicans.\n$\\binom{55}{3} = \\frac{55!}{3!(55-3)!} = \\frac{55*54*53}{3*2*1}$\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to choose 2 Democrats from 45 Democrats.\nUsing the same combination formula, we have $n=45$ and $k=2$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of combinations for the Democrats.\n$\\binom{45}{2} = \\frac{45!}{2!(45-2)!} = \\frac{45*44}{2*1}$\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to choose a 5-person committee consisting of 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats.\nThis is the product of the combinations for Republicans and Democrats. $\\binom{55}{3} * \\binom{45}{2}$\n\n## Step 6: Perform the multiplication and calculations from step 2 and step 4.\n$\\binom{55}{3} = 17710$ and $\\binom{45}{2} = 990$. Multiply the two results: $17710 * 990 = 17509800$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17509800}$"
