    "problem": "During the school year, the 10 members of the chess club play a total of 900 games of chess during their practice matches. Each member plays against every other member $N$ times. What is the value of $N$?",
    "solution": "Since there are 10 club members, there are $\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10\\cdot 9}{2} = 45$ pairings of members.  Thus, each pair must have played $\\frac{900}{45} = \\boxed{20}$ games.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the value of N, which represents the number of times each member plays against every other member, we first need to determine the total number of games played between any two members of the chess club.\n## Step 2:  Since there are 10 members, the total number of games played between any two members can be calculated using the combination formula $\\binom{n}{2}$, where n is the total number of members. This formula represents the number of ways to choose 2 members from a group of n members.\n## Step 3:  Applying the combination formula, we get $\\binom{10}{2}=\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2}=45$ games played between any two members.\n## Step 4:  Now, we need to find the value of N, which represents the number of times each member plays against every other member. Let's assume that each member plays against every other member N times.\n## Step 5:  Since there are 10 members, each member plays against 9 other members, resulting in a total of $10 \\cdot 9 = 90$ games. However, this counts each game twice, as it counts both perspectives of every game (e.g., it counts both Alice vs. Bob and Bob vs. Alice as separate games).\n## Step 6:  Therefore, we need to divide the total number of games by 2 to get the correct count of games played between any two members. This gives us $N = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{45}$"
