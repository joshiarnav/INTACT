    "problem": "An airline serves a dinner to all the passengers on an airplane. They get their choice of steak or fish. Three steak meals and three fish meals are set aside for the six-member crew. If the meals are distributed to the crew members randomly, what is the probability that both pilots get the fish?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose 2 of the 6 meals for the pilots. There are $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways to choose 2 of the 3 fish meals. So the probability is $3/15 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to distribute the meals to the crew members.\nThe total number of meals set aside for the crew is 6 (3 steak and 3 fish). Since each of the 6 crew members gets a meal, we are distributing 6 distinct items to 6 distinct people. This is a permutation problem, and the total number of ways to distribute these meals is 6! (6 factorial), which equals 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways both pilots can get the fish.\nFor both pilots to get the fish, we have already decided their meals. This leaves us with 4 meals (2 steak and 2 fish) to distribute among the remaining 4 crew members. Since the order matters (as each meal is distinct), we use permutations for the remaining crew members. Thus, we calculate 4! (4 factorial), which equals 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to distribute the remaining 4 meals after the pilots have been given fish.\nThe remaining meals are 2 steak and 2 fish. We need to find the number of ways to distribute these among the 4 remaining crew members, who have not yet been given meals. This is a permutation problem with 4 items to be distributed to 4 people, so we calculate 4! (4 factorial), which equals 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of favorable outcomes.\nThe total number of favorable outcomes is the product of the number of ways both pilots can get the fish (Step 2) and the number of ways to distribute the remaining meals (Step 3). This equals 24 * 24 = 576.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that both pilots get the fish.\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes (Step 4) divided by the total number of outcomes (Step 1). So, the probability equals 576 / 720.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the fraction obtained in Step 5 to get the final probability.\nTo simplify the fraction 576 / 720, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator. The GCD of 576 and 720 is 144. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 144, we get 4 / 5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$"
