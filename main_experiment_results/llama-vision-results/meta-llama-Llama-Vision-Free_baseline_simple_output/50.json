    "problem": "A class of 25 students includes the Smith quadruplets.  The teacher must select two students from the class to represent the class in the school's student government.  Instead of holding an election, the teacher decides to choose the two representatives at random.  What is the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets?",
    "solution": "There are ${25 \\choose 2} = 300$ possible pairs of student representatives. Of these, since there are 4 Smith quadruplets, there are ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ pairs in which both representatives are Smith quadruplets. So, the probability of both representatives being Smith quadruplets is $\\frac{6}{300} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to choose 2 representatives from 25 students.\nTo find the total number of ways to choose 2 representatives from 25 students, we use the combination formula, which is given by $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $r$ is the number of items to choose, and $!$ denotes factorial. In this case, $n=25$ and $r=2$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 representatives from 25 students.\nApplying the combination formula, we get $\\binom{25}{2} = \\frac{25!}{2!(25-2)!} = \\frac{25*24}{2} = 300$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to choose 2 representatives from the 4 Smith quadruplets.\nTo find the number of ways to choose 2 representatives from the 4 Smith quadruplets, we use the same combination formula. In this case, $n=4$ and $r=2$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 representatives from the 4 Smith quadruplets.\nApplying the combination formula, we get $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4*3}{2} = 6$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets.\nThe probability of choosing two representatives who are both Smith quadruplets is given by the ratio of the number of ways to choose 2 representatives from the 4 Smith quadruplets to the total number of ways to choose 2 representatives from 25 students.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets.\nThe probability is $\\frac{6}{300} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$"
