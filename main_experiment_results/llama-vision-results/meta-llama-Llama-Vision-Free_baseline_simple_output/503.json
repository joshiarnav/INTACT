    "problem": "Mr. Patrick is preparing a five-question true-false quiz for his class. He flips a coin before writing the first question. If it is heads, he writes a true statement and if it is tails, he writes a false statement. He continues this until all five statements are written. What is the probability that the correct sequence of answers is TFTFT ? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Since all sequences of 5 answers are equally likely, the probability of any given 5-answer sequence is simply $\\frac{1}{2^5}$, since each answer is equally likely to be true or false. So, the answer evaluates to $\\frac{1}{2^5} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{32}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the probability of getting the sequence TFTFT for the first question.\nThe first question can be either true (T) or false (F), and since Mr. Patrick flips a coin to decide, the probability of getting the first T is 1/2.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the probability of getting the sequence TFTFT for the second question.\nAfter getting the first T, there are two possible scenarios: the sequence is TTF... or TFTF. Since there is a 1/2 chance of getting a T or F after the first flip, the probability of getting the T after a T is 1/2.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the probability of getting the sequence TFTFT for the third question.\nThere are now three possible scenarios: the sequence is TTFF..., TFTF, or TFFT. Since there is a 1/2 chance of getting a T or F after the first two flips, the probability of getting an F after two Ts is 1/4.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the probability of getting the sequence TFTFT for the fourth question.\nThere are now four possible scenarios: the sequence is TTTF..., TTFF, TFTF, or TFFT. Since there is a 1/2 chance of getting a T or F after the first three flips, the probability of getting an F after three Ts and one F is 1/8.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the probability of getting the sequence TFTFT for the fifth question.\nThere are now five possible scenarios: the sequence is TTTTF..., TTFFF, TFTFF, TFTFF, or TFFTF. Since there is a 1/2 chance of getting a T or F after the first four flips, the probability of getting a T after four Ts, one F, and one T is 1/16.\n\n## Step 6: Multiply the probabilities of each step to get the total probability of the sequence.\nThe total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step: (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/4) * (1/8) * (1/16).\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the product.\n(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/4) * (1/8) * (1/16) = 1/1024.\n\n## Step 8: The probability is already expressed as a common fraction.\nThe probability is 1/1024.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1024}}$"
