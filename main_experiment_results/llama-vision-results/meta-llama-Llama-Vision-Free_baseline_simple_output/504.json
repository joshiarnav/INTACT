    "problem": "A 6-sided die is weighted so that the probability of any number being rolled is proportional to the value of the roll.  (So, for example, the probability of a 2 being rolled is twice that of a 1 being rolled.)  What is the expected value of a roll of this weighted die?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the probability that a 1 is rolled.  Then the probability that a 2 is rolled is $2x$, the probability that a 3 is rolled is $3x$, and so on.  Since the sum of all these probabilities must be 1, we have that $x + 2x + \\cdots + 6x = 1$, which means that $21x = 1$, so $x = \\frac{1}{21}$.  Therefore \\[ E = \\frac{1}{21}(1) + \\frac{2}{21}(2) + \\cdots + \\frac{6}{21}(6) = \\frac{1^2 + 2^2 + \\cdots 6^2}{21} = \\boxed{\\frac{13}{3}}. \\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem\nWe are given a 6-sided die with probabilities of rolling each number proportional to the value of the roll.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the possible outcomes and their associated probabilities\nLet's label the possible outcomes as $x_1, x_2, ..., x_6$, where $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, ..., x_6 = 6$. The probability of each outcome is proportional to its value. So, we can express the probabilities as $p_1, p_2, ..., p_6$, where $p_i = kx_i$ for some constant $k$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the value of the constant k\nSince the probabilities must sum to 1, we have $p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_6 = 1$. Substituting the expressions for $p_i$, we get $k(x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_6) = 1$. We can simplify this to $k(1 + 2 + ... + 6) = 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of the values of the outcomes\nWe can calculate the sum of the values of the outcomes as $1 + 2 + ... + 6 = \\frac{6(7)}{2} = 21$.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute the sum into the equation for k\nSubstituting the sum into the equation for $k$, we get $k(21) = 1$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for k\nDividing both sides by 21, we get $k = \\frac{1}{21}$.\n\n## Step 7: Express the probabilities in terms of k\nNow that we have the value of $k$, we can express the probabilities as $p_1 = \\frac{1}{21}, p_2 = \\frac{2}{21}, ..., p_6 = \\frac{6}{21}$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the expected value\nThe expected value of a roll is the sum of the product of each outcome and its probability. So, we can calculate the expected value as $E = \\frac{1}{21}(1) + \\frac{2}{21}(2) + ... + \\frac{6}{21}(6)$.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the expression for the expected value\nWe can simplify the expression for the expected value by factoring out the common factor of $\\frac{1}{21}$: $E = \\frac{1}{21}(1 + 2(2) + 3(3) + 4(4) + 5(5) + 6(6))$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the sum inside the parentheses\nWe can calculate the sum inside the parentheses by expanding and combining like terms: $1 + 2(2) + 3(3) + 4(4) + 5(5) + 6(6) = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 = 91$.\n\n## Step 11: Substitute the sum into the expression for the expected value\nSubstituting the sum into the expression for the expected value, we get $E = \\frac{1}{21}(91)$.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the expression for the expected value\nWe can simplify the expression for the expected value by dividing: $E = \\frac{91}{21}$.\n\n## Step 13: Simplify the fraction\nWe can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 7: $E = \\frac{13}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{13}{3}}$"
