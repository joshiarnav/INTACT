    "problem": "In how many ways can 6 girls and 2 boys sit in a row if the 2 boys insist on sitting next to each other?",
    "solution": "We can consider the two boys as one person, arrange the ``seven'' people first, then arrange the 2 boys.  So the number of seating arrangements in which the boys sit together is $7!\\times 2!=\\boxed{10,\\!080}$.",
    "total_tokens": 262,
    "time_taken": 33.88819217681885,
    "file_name": "./MATH/test/counting_and_probability/508.json",
    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Consider the 2 boys as 1 unit to ensure they sit together.\nWe can treat the 2 boys as a single unit to ensure they sit next to each other.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of arrangements for the 7 units (5 girls + 1 unit of 2 boys).\nThere are 7 units in total (5 girls + 1 unit of 2 boys), and we can arrange these 7 units in 7! = 5040 ways.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of arrangements for the 2 boys within their unit.\nWithin the unit of 2 boys, there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange the boys.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of arrangements with the boys sitting together.\nTo find the total number of arrangements with the boys sitting together, we multiply the number of arrangements of the 7 units by the number of arrangements of the 2 boys within their unit: 5040 * 2 = 10080.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10080}$"
