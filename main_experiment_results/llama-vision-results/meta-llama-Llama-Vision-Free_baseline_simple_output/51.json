    "problem": "Paul and Jesse each choose a number at random from the first six primes. What is the probability that the sum of the numbers they choose is even?",
    "solution": "The only way for the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose to be odd is if one of them chooses 2 and the other chooses an odd prime. There are five ways for Paul to choose 2 and Jesse to choose an odd prime, and there are five ways for Jesse to choose 2 and Paul to choose an odd prime. Since there are $6\\cdot 6=36$ total possible ways for Paul and Jesse to choose their numbers, the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose is NOT even is $\\frac{10}{36}=\\frac{5}{18}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose IS even is $1-\\frac{5}{18}=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{18}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To start solving this problem, we first need to understand what an even sum of numbers means in the context of this question. An even sum results from either both numbers being even or both numbers being odd.\n## Step 2:  The first six primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Among these, 2 is the only even prime, and the rest are odd.\n## Step 3:  Therefore, for the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose to be even, they must both choose odd numbers, as there's only one even prime available.\n## Step 4:  The total number of ways they can each choose a prime is $6 \\times 6 = 36$, as there are six primes for Paul to choose from, and six primes for Jesse to choose from.\n## Step 5:  To find the number of ways both can choose odd primes, we consider that there are five odd primes to choose from for each of them. Thus, the total number of ways for both to choose odd primes is $5 \\times 5 = 25$.\n## Step 6:  Now, to find the probability that the sum of the numbers they choose is even, we need to calculate the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (choosing two odd primes) to the total number of possible outcomes.\n## Step 7:  The probability is then calculated as $\\frac{25}{36}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{36}}$"
