    "problem": "Steve has one quarter, two nickels and three pennies. Assuming no items are free, for how many different-priced items could Steve individually pay for with exact change?",
    "solution": "Steve can use no quarters or one quarter, for two possibilities.\n\nSteve can use 0, 1, or 2 nickels, for three possibilities.\n\nAnd Steve can use 0, 1, 2, or 3 pennies, for four possibilities.  That gives $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 = 24$ possible combinations.  But we must remove the combination where Steve does not use any coins, leaving us with $24 - 1 = \\boxed{23}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total value of the coins Steve has\nSteve has one quarter, which is $0.25, two nickels, which is $0.10, and three pennies, which is $0.03. So, the total value of the coins is $0.25 + $0.10 + $0.03 = $0.38.\n\n## Step 2: List the different possible combinations of coins that add up to $0.38\nThe combinations of coins and their total values are as follows:\n- Quarter ($0.25), nickel ($0.05), and 3 pennies ($0.03) = $0.33\n- Quarter ($0.25) and 13 pennies ($0.13) = $0.38\n- Quarter ($0.25) and 2 nickels ($0.10) = $0.35\n- 2 nickels ($0.10) and 28 pennies ($0.28) = $0.38\n- 2 nickels ($0.10) and 8 pennies ($0.08) = $0.18\n- 2 nickels ($0.10) and 3 pennies ($0.03) = $0.13\n- 2 nickels ($0.10) = $0.10\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of different-priced items Steve could buy\nWe can ignore the combinations that add up to $0.18, $0.13, and $0.10 because they are not $0.38 exactly. The combinations that add up to $0.38 are:\n- Quarter ($0.25), nickel ($0.05), and 3 pennies ($0.03) = $0.33 (can't buy with this combination)\n- Quarter ($0.25) and 13 pennies ($0.13) = $0.38 (can buy with this combination)\n- 2 nickels ($0.10) and 28 pennies ($0.28) = $0.38 (can buy with this combination)\n\n## Step 4: Count the different-priced items\nSteve could buy 2 different-priced items.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$"
