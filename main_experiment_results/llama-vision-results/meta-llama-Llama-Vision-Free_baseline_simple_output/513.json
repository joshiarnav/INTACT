    "problem": "Our basketball team has 10 players, including Steve and Danny.  We need to divide into two teams of 5 for an intra-squad scrimmage.  In how many ways can we do this if Steve and Danny insist on playing on opposing teams?",
    "solution": "If Steve and Danny are on opposite teams, there are 8 other players to choose from for the other 4 spots on Steve's team, so there are $\\binom{8}{4} = \\boxed{70}$ choices.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recognize that Steve and Danny must be on opposing teams, so we can think of them as fixed units.\nThere are two teams that we can put Steve and Danny on: team A and team B.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining players for team A.\nThere are 8 players left to choose from for team A, and we need to choose 3 of them.  We can calculate this using the combination formula, which is nCr = n! / ((n-r)! * r!), where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to be chosen.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the combination for choosing 3 players out of 8.\nWe can calculate this using the combination formula as follows:\n8C3 = 8! / ((8-3)! * 3!) = 8! / (5! * 3!) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1) = 56\n\n## Step 4: Recognize that once we have chosen the remaining players for team A, the remaining 4 players will automatically be on team B.\nSince Steve and Danny are already on opposite teams, the 4 remaining players will automatically be on the opposing team of the 3 chosen players.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of ways to divide the players into two teams with Steve and Danny on opposing teams.\nSince we have 56 ways to choose 3 players out of 8, this is also the total number of ways to divide the players into two teams with Steve and Danny on opposing teams.\n\n## Step 6: Write the final answer.\nWe have calculated that there are 56 ways to divide the players into two teams with Steve and Danny on opposing teams.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{56}$"
