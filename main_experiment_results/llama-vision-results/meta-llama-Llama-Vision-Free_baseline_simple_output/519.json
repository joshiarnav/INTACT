    "problem": "In how many ways can 4 distinct beads be placed on a bracelet that has a knot in it?  (Beads cannot slide past the knot.  Two ways are considered the same if one is a reflection of the other, since we can flip the bracelet over.)",
    "solution": "We can just treat the knot as another bead. There are $5!$ ways to place the beads and the knot on the bracelet, but we must divide by 5 for rotational symmetry (5 rotations for each arrangement), and by 2 for reflectional symmetry (we can flip the bracelet to get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{5!}{5 \\times 2} = \\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem\nThe problem involves arranging 4 distinct beads on a bracelet with a knot, meaning that the beads cannot slide past the knot, and two arrangements are considered the same if one is a reflection of the other.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of distinct arrangements without considering reflections\nSince there are 4 distinct beads, we can arrange them in $4! = 24$ ways on the bracelet.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the reflection symmetry of the bracelet\nBecause the bracelet can be flipped over, each arrangement has a corresponding reflection, which is considered the same arrangement. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of distinct arrangements by 2 to account for this symmetry.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final number of distinct arrangements\nDivide the total number of distinct arrangements (24) by 2 to account for the reflection symmetry.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the final answer\n$\\frac{24}{2} = 12$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
