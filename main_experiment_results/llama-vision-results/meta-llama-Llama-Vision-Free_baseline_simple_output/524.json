    "problem": "Regions $A, B, C, J$ and $K$ represent ponds. Logs leave pond $A$ and float down flumes (represented by arrows) to eventually end up in pond $B$ or pond $C$. On leaving a pond, the logs are equally likely to use any available exit flume. Logs can only float in the direction the arrow is pointing. What is the probability that a log in pond $A$ will end up in pond $B$?

    "solution": "There are two paths from A to B: A to K to B, and A to J to B.  The probability that a log will go from A to K to B is the probability that it will choose the middle flume initially times the probability that it will choose the flume to the right given that it chose the middle flume initially: $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\frac{1}{6}$.  Similarly, the probability that the log will go from A to J to B is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{9}$.  In total, the probability that the log reaches B is $\\dfrac{1}{6}+\\dfrac{1}{9}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a log in pond $A$ will end up in pond $B$.\n## Step 2:  When a log leaves pond $A$, it has three equally likely exit flumes to choose from: the one leading to pond $J$, the one leading to pond $K$, and the one leading to pond $C$.\n## Step 3:  Out of these three options, we are interested in the probability that the log ends up in pond $B$. Therefore, we need to calculate the probability of the log passing through pond $J$ and then pond $K$ before reaching pond $B$.\n## Step 4:  The probability of a log passing through pond $J$ from pond $A$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$, as there are three equally likely exit flumes. Once in pond $J$, the log has two equally likely exit flumes to choose from: the one leading to pond $B$ and the one leading to pond $K$.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the probability that the log ends up in pond $B$ after passing through pond $J$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n## Step 6:  Now, we can calculate the total probability by multiplying the probability of the log passing through pond $J$ and then pond $B$.\n## Step 7:  This gives us $\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the probability that a log in pond $A$ will end up in pond $B$ is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$"
