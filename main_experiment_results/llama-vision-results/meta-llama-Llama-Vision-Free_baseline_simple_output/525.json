    "problem": "In how many ways can $7$ people sit around a round table if no two of the $3$ people Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other? (Seating arrangements which are rotations of each other are treated as the same.)",
    "solution": "After Pierre sits, we can place Rosa either two seats from Pierre (that is, with one seat between them) or three seats from Pierre. We tackle these two cases separately:\n\nCase 1: Rosa is two seats from Pierre. There are $2$ such seats. For either of these, there are then four empty seats in a row, and one empty seat between Rosa and Pierre. Thomas can sit in either of the middle two of the four empty seats in a row. So, there are $2\\cdot 2 = 4$ ways to seat Rosa and Thomas in this case. There are then $4$ seats left, which the others can take in $4! = 24$ ways. So, there are $4\\cdot 24 = 96$ seatings in this case.\n\nCase 2: Rosa is three seats from Pierre (that is, there are $2$ seats between them). There are $2$ such seats. Thomas can't sit in either of the $2$ seats directly between them, but after Rosa sits, there are $3$ empty seats in a row still, and Thomas can only sit in the middle seat of these three. Once again, there are $4$ empty seats remaining, and the $4$ remaining people can sit in them in $4! = 24$ ways. So, we have $2\\cdot 24 = 48$ seatings in this case.\n\nPutting our two cases together gives a total of $96+48 = \\boxed{144}$ seatings.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and constraints\nWe are asked to find the number of ways 7 people can sit around a round table, with the restriction that no two of the 3 people Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of ways to seat 7 people around a round table\nThe total number of ways to seat 7 people around a round table is (7-1)!, because we can fix one person's position and arrange the remaining 6 people in (7-1)! ways.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to seat 7 people around a round table with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting next to each other\nWe will consider Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single block. This block, along with the remaining 4 people, forms a group of 5 people. The total number of ways to seat these 5 people around a round table is (5-1)!. Now, within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit in 3! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to seat 7 people around a round table with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting next to each other is 3!* (5-1)!.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to seat 7 people around a round table with the restriction\nTo find the number of ways 7 people can sit around a round table with the restriction, we subtract the number of ways with the restriction from the total number of ways to seat 7 people around a round table.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the final number\nNow, we will calculate the final number of ways. This is (7-1)! - 3!* (5-1)!. The total number of ways to seat 7 people around a round table is (7-1)! = 6! = 720. The total number of ways to seat 7 people around a round table with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting next to each other is 3!* (5-1)! = 3!* 4! = 6 * 24 = 144. Now, we need to subtract these two numbers: 720 - 144 = 576.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{576}$"
