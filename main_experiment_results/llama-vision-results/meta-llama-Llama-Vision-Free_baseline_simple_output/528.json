    "problem": "A cook has 10 red peppers and 5 green peppers. If the cook selects 6 peppers at random, what is the probability that he selects at least 4 green peppers? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We can count the number of ways to choose a group of 4 green and 2 red peppers and the number of ways to choose 5 green and 1 red peppers. These are $\\binom{5}{4}\\binom{10}{2}=5\\cdot45=225$ and $\\binom{5}{5}\\binom{10}{1}=10$. The total number of ways the cook can choose peppers is $\\binom{15}{6}=5005$. Therefore, the probability that out of six randomly chosen peppers at least four will be green is $\\frac{235}{5005}=\\boxed{\\frac{47}{1001}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We need to find the probability of selecting at least 4 green peppers when 6 peppers are chosen at random from a total of 15 peppers.\n## Step 2:  To approach this, we can calculate the probability of selecting exactly 4 green peppers, exactly 5 green peppers, and exactly 6 green peppers, and then sum these probabilities.\n## Step 3:  First, let's determine the total number of ways to choose 6 peppers from the 15 available. This can be calculated using combinations, denoted as $\\binom{n}{r}$, where $n$ is the total number of items and $r$ is the number of items to choose. In this case, we have $\\binom{15}{6}=5005$ ways to choose 6 peppers from 15.\n## Step 4:  Now, let's consider the specific cases where we choose exactly 4 green peppers. There are 5 green peppers, and we want to choose 4 of them, which can be done in $\\binom{5}{4}=5$ ways. We also need to choose 2 red peppers from the 10 available, which can be done in $\\binom{10}{2}=45$ ways. Therefore, there are $5\\cdot 45=225$ ways to choose exactly 4 green peppers.\n## Step 5:  Next, we consider the case where we choose exactly 5 green peppers. There are $\\binom{5}{5}=1$ way to choose all 5 green peppers, and we also need to choose 1 red pepper from the 10 available, which can be done in $\\binom{10}{1}=10$ ways. Therefore, there are $1\\cdot 10=10$ ways to choose exactly 5 green peppers.\n## Step 6:  Finally, we consider the case where we choose all 6 peppers as green peppers. There is $\\binom{5}{6}=0$ way to choose all 6 green peppers, since we cannot choose 6 peppers from only 5 green peppers.\n## Step 7:  Having determined the number of ways for each case, we can now calculate the total number of ways to choose at least 4 green peppers by summing the ways for each individual case.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the total number of successful outcomes is $225+10+0=235$.\n## Step 9:  Finally, we can find the probability by dividing the total number of successful outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes, which is $\\dfrac{235}{5005}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{47}{1001}}$"
