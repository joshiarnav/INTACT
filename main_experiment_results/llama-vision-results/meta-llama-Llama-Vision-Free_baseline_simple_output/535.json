    "problem": "A school organization consists of 5 teachers, 7 parents and 6 students. A subcommittee of this group is formed by choosing 2 teachers, 3 parents and 3 students. How many different subcommittees can be formed?",
    "solution": "We can break this problem into three parts.  First, we will count the number of ways to choose teachers for the subcommittee.  We need to choose 2 teachers from the 5 in the school organization, which gives $\\dbinom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose the teachers.  Next, we choose parents.  We need to choose 3 parents out of 7, which gives $\\dbinom{7}{3}=35$ ways to choose the parents.  Finally, we choose the students.  There are 3 students chosen from 6, which gives $\\dbinom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose the students.  Each of these selections is independent, so the total number of possible subcommittees will be $10\\cdot 35\\cdot 20=\\boxed{7000}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to choose 2 teachers out of 5\nTo find the number of ways to choose 2 teachers out of 5, we use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, for the teachers, we have C(5, 2).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 teachers out of 5\nUsing the formula from step 1, we calculate C(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 5! / (2!3!) = (5*4) / (2*1) = 10.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to choose 3 parents out of 7\nUsing the same combination formula as in step 1, we find the number of ways to choose 3 parents out of 7: C(7, 3).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 parents out of 7\nUsing the formula from step 3, we calculate C(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!) = 7! / (3!4!) = (7*6*5) / (3*2*1) = 35.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the number of ways to choose 3 students out of 6\nUsing the same combination formula as in step 1, we find the number of ways to choose 3 students out of 6: C(6, 3).\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 students out of 6\nUsing the formula from step 5, we calculate C(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 6! / (3!3!) = (6*5*4) / (3*2*1) = 20.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total number of different subcommittees that can be formed by multiplying the results from step 2, step 4, and step 6\nTo get the total number of different subcommittees, we multiply the results from step 2, step 4, and step 6: 10 * 35 * 20.\n\n## Step 8: Final calculation\n10 * 35 * 20 = 7000.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7000}$"
