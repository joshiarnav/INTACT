    "problem": "How many subsets of the set of divisors of $72$ contain only composite numbers? For example, $\\{8,9\\}$ and $\\{4,8,12\\}$ are two such sets. Include the empty set in your count.",
    "solution": "We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \\cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Find the divisors of 72\nFirst, we need to find all the divisors of 72. To do this, we'll list the numbers that divide 72 without leaving a remainder.\n\n## Step 2: List all the divisors of 72\nThe divisors of 72 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the composite numbers among the divisors\nNow, we need to identify which of these divisors are composite numbers. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. In other words, it is a number that is not prime.\n\n## Step 4: Classify the divisors as composite or prime\nFrom the list of divisors, we can classify the numbers as follows:\n- Composite: 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\n- Prime: 2, 3\n\n## Step 5: Count the number of composite divisors\nNow that we have identified the composite divisors, we can count how many there are. There are 9 composite divisors.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of subsets that contain only composite numbers\nTo calculate the total number of subsets that contain only composite numbers, we can use the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in the subset. However, in this case, we are considering subsets of the composite divisors only, which means we are dealing with a subset of the original set. Since there are 9 composite divisors, we have 2^9 possible subsets. However, we also need to include the empty set in our count.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the final answer\nWe can calculate the final answer by using the formula 2^n and including the empty set. 2^9 = 512.\n\n## Step 8: Final Answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{512}$"
