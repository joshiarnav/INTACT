    "problem": "How many numbers between 100 and 200 (inclusive) are not perfect squares?",
    "solution": "There are $200-100+1 = 101$ numbers in the list $100, 101, \\ldots, 200$.  We can find 5 perfect squares in the list, namely $10^2,\\ldots,14^2$.  So the number of non-perfect-squares in the list is $101-5=\\boxed{96}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the range of numbers that are perfect squares between 100 and 200.\nTo do this, we need to find the smallest and largest integers whose squares are between 100 and 200.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the smallest integer whose square is greater than or equal to 100.\nWe start by finding the square root of 100, which is 10.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to 200.\nWe find the square root of 200, which is approximately 14.142. So the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to 200 is 14.\n\n## Step 4: List all perfect squares between 100 and 200.\nThe perfect squares between 100 and 200 are: $11^2=121$, $12^2=144$, $13^2=169$, and $14^2=196$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of perfect squares between 100 and 200.\nThere are 4 perfect squares in the range.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of integers between 100 and 200 (inclusive).\nSince the range is inclusive, the total number of integers is 200 - 100 + 1 = 101.\n\n## Step 7: Subtract the number of perfect squares from the total number of integers to find the number of numbers that are not perfect squares.\nWe subtract the number of perfect squares (4) from the total number of integers (101) to get 101 - 4 = 97.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{97}$"
