    "problem": "Five 6-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show a 1 or a 2?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which of the five dice show a 1 or 2. The probability of any one of these occurring is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{\\!3}$. So the overall probability is $$10\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{\\!3}=\\frac{10\\times 2^3}{3^5}=\\boxed{\\frac{80}{243}}.$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five 6-sided dice.\nWhen rolling five 6-sided dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes, so the total number of possible outcomes for all five dice is $6^5 = 7776$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose exactly two dice out of five to show a 1 or a 2.\nTo choose exactly two dice out of five to show a 1 or a 2, we use the combination formula $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $r$ is the number of items to choose. In this case, $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of the chosen two dice showing a 1 or a 2.\nFor each of the two chosen dice to show a 1 or a 2, there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. So, the probability for each of the two chosen dice is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of the other three dice not showing a 1 or a 2.\nFor each of the other three dice not to show a 1 or a 2, there are 4 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. So, the probability for each of the other three dice is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total probability of exactly two dice showing a 1 or a 2.\nThe probability of exactly two dice showing a 1 or a 2 is the product of the number of ways to choose two dice, the probability of the chosen two dice showing a 1 or a 2, and the probability of the other three dice not showing a 1 or a 2. This is given by $\\binom{5}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = 10 \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right) \\left(\\frac{8}{27}\\right) = \\frac{80}{243}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{80}{243}}$"
