    "problem": "Carson flips over the cards of a standard 52-card deck one at a time. What is the probability that he flips over the ace of spades before any face card (jack, queen or king)?",
    "solution": "There are 12 face cards, three from each suit. Within the deck, the 13 relevant cards (the face cards and the ace of spades) are arranged in some order. The probability that the first of these 13 cards is the ace is therefore $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{13}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of cards in a standard deck.\nThere are 52 cards in a standard deck.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of face cards in a standard deck.\nThere are 3 face cards (jack, queen, king) in each suit, and there are 4 suits, so the total number of face cards is 3 * 4 = 12.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of cards that are not face cards.\nThere are 52 - 12 = 40 cards that are not face cards.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of cards that are not the ace of spades and are not face cards.\nThere are 39 cards that are not the ace of spades and are not face cards.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of cards that are the ace of spades.\nThere is only 1 ace of spades.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of cards that are either the ace of spades or not face cards.\nThere is 1 ace of spades, and 40 cards that are not face cards, but this includes the ace of spades, so we need to subtract the ace of spades to avoid double counting. 40 + 1 - 1 = 40.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability that Carson flips over the ace of spades before any face card.\nThe probability that Carson flips over the ace of spades before any face card is 1 / 40.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{40}}$"
