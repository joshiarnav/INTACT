    "problem": "Alyssa has four marbles: a red one, a blue one, a green one, and a yellow one. In how many different ways can she form a set consisting of some of the marbles if she must choose at least one marble?  (In a set of chosen marbles, it does not matter in what order she chose the marbles.)",
    "solution": "Each of the four marbles can either be in Alyssa's set, or not.  That gives two possibilities for each marble, for a total of $2^4=16$ possible sets.  However, we are told the set must have at least one marble.  We need to subtract one to eliminate the case of an empty set, which we counted.  Our final answer is $16-1=\\boxed{15}$ sets.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We need to find the number of ways Alyssa can form a set consisting of some of her marbles, with the condition that she must choose at least one marble.\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we first identify that choosing a set of marbles is equivalent to choosing a subset of the marbles, where the order of selection does not matter.\n## Step 3:  We have a total of 4 marbles: red, blue, green, and yellow. Since Alyssa must choose at least one marble, the problem boils down to finding the number of non-empty subsets that can be formed from these 4 marbles.\n## Step 4:  We can calculate the total number of subsets by considering all possible combinations of marbles, including the empty set.\n## Step 5:  There are $2^4=16$ total subsets of marbles, including the empty set.\n## Step 6:  However, we need to exclude the empty set from our count, as Alyssa must choose at least one marble.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the number of non-empty subsets of marbles is $16-1=15$.\n## Step 8:  Hence, Alyssa can form 15 different sets consisting of some of her marbles, with the condition that she must choose at least one marble.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
