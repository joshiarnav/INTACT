    "problem": "Our club has $25$ members, and wishes to pick a president, secretary, and treasurer. In how many ways can we choose the officers, if individual members are allowed to hold $2,$ but not all $3,$ offices?",
    "solution": "With no restriction, the president can be any of the $25$ members, the secretary can be any of the $25$ remaining members, and the treasurer can be any of the remaining $25$ members.\n\nIf the same member holds all three offices, it could be any of the $25$ members, so there are $25$ ways for this to happen. We must exclude these $25$ possibilities, so the answer is $25\\times 25\\times 25-25=\\boxed{15,600}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: We need to calculate the number of ways to choose the officers for each individual office.\nWe have three offices to fill: president, secretary, and treasurer.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose the president.\nThe president can be any of the 25 members, so there are 25 ways to choose the president.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose the secretary.\nAfter choosing the president, there are 24 members left, so there are 24 ways to choose the secretary.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose the treasurer.\nAfter choosing the president and secretary, there are 23 members left, so there are 23 ways to choose the treasurer.\n\n## Step 5: However, we need to account for the restriction that no member can hold all three offices.\nSince we cannot choose the same member for all three offices, we need to subtract the cases where the same member is chosen for all three offices.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to choose all three officers to be the same person.\nThere are 25 ways to choose a single member to hold all three offices.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total number of ways to choose the officers without the restriction.\nTo find the total number of ways to choose the officers without the restriction, we multiply the number of choices for each office together: 25 * 24 * 23.\n\n## Step 8: Subtract the cases where the same member is chosen for all three offices from the total.\nWe subtract the 25 cases where the same member is chosen for all three offices from the total.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the final number of ways to choose the officers with the restriction.\nThe final number of ways to choose the officers is (25 * 24 * 23) - 25.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the final expression.\n(25 * 24 * 23) - 25 = 13860 - 25 = 13835.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13835}$"
