    "problem": "Mr. Smith brings home 7 animals for his 7 children.  Each child will adopt a pet to be her or his own.  There are 4 different cats (a Siamese, a Persian, a Calico, and a Minx), 2 different dogs (a Poodle and a Golden Retriever), and a goldfish.  Anna and Betty refuse to take care of the goldfish, and Charlie and Danny insist on having cats.  The other 3 kids are easier to please -- they'll take anything.  In how many ways can Mr. Smith give the children pets they'll want?",
    "solution": "Charlie can take one of the 4 cats, and Danny can take one of the 3 remaining cats, so there are $4\\times 3=12$ ways to give cats to these two kids. Since Anna and Betty can't take a goldfish, they select from the 4 remaining animals so there are $4\\times 3=12$ ways to give pets to these two kids. For the other three kids, there are $3\\times 2\\times 1=6$ ways to give out the remaining 3 pets. The answer is $12\\times 12\\times 6=\\boxed{864}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Identify the total number of pets available for distribution.\nThere are 4 different cats, 2 different dogs, and 1 goldfish, making a total of 7 pets available.\n\n## Step 2:  Determine the number of children who will take cats.\nCharlie and Danny insist on having cats, so 2 children will take cats.\n\n## Step 3:  Calculate the number of ways to distribute the cats.\nSince Charlie and Danny will take cats, there are 2 cats left. These 2 cats can be distributed to the remaining 2 children in 2! = 2 ways.\n\n## Step 4:  Determine the number of children who will take either a dog or the goldfish.\nThere are 5 children left, and they will take either a dog or the goldfish. Anna and Betty refuse to take care of the goldfish, so they will take dogs.\n\n## Step 5:  Calculate the number of ways to distribute the dogs.\nThere are 2 dogs and 2 children who will take them, so there are 2! = 2 ways to distribute the dogs.\n\n## Step 6:  Calculate the number of ways to distribute the goldfish.\nThe goldfish can be given to any of the 3 children who have not been assigned a pet yet. Therefore, there are 3 ways to distribute the goldfish.\n\n## Step 7:  Calculate the total number of ways to distribute the pets.\nThe total number of ways to distribute the pets is the product of the number of ways to distribute the cats, dogs, and goldfish. This is equal to 2 * 2 * 3 = 12.\n\n## Step 8:  Calculate the final number of ways to distribute the pets.\nSince the order of distribution matters, we need to multiply the result by the number of ways to distribute the remaining 2 pets among the 2 children. This is equal to 2! = 2.\n\n## Step 9:  Calculate the final number of ways to distribute the pets.\nThe final number of ways to distribute the pets is 12 * 2 = 24.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$"
