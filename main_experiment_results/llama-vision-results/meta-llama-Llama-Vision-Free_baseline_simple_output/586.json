    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the definition of binomial coefficient\nThe binomial coefficient, often referred to as \"n choose k\", is calculated as $\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n!$ denotes the factorial of $n$, which is the product of all positive integers up to $n$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the definition to $\\dbinom{n}{n}$\nFor $\\dbinom{n}{n}$, we substitute $k=n$ into the formula, giving us $\\dbinom{n}{n} = \\dfrac{n!}{n!(n-n)!}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression\nSince $n-n = 0$, we have $n-n)! = 0!$. And by definition, $0! = 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Final simplification\nThe expression now reduces to $\\dbinom{n}{n} = \\dfrac{n!}{n! \\cdot 1}$.\n\n## Step 5: Cancel the $n!$ terms\nThis simplifies to $\\dbinom{n}{n} = \\dfrac{1}{1}$, which simplifies further to just $1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
