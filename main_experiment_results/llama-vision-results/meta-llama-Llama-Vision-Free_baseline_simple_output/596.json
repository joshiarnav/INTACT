    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the pattern of the list\nThe list starts with 6 and each subsequent number increases by 4.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the first and last terms of the list\nThe first term is 6 and the last term is 86.\n\n## Step 3: Use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence\nThe formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the number of terms, and $d$ is the common difference.\n\n## Step 4: Plug in the values for $a_n$, $a_1$, and $d$\nWe have $a_n = 86$, $a_1 = 6$, and $d = 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $n$\nSubstituting the values into the formula, we get $86 = 6 + (n-1) \\cdot 4$. Subtracting 6 from both sides gives $80 = (n-1) \\cdot 4$. Dividing both sides by 4 gives $20 = n - 1$. Adding 1 to both sides gives $n = 21$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$"
