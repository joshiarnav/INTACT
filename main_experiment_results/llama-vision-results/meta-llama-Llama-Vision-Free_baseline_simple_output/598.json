    "problem": "How many ways are there to answer a $10$-question true/false test, where at least $3$ of the questions have been answered with a false?",
    "solution": "There are $2^{10} = 1024$ ways to answer the questions on the true/false test. However, we can also compute the number of ways of answering the questions on the true/false test by using combinations; there are $\\binom{10}{k}$ ways to answer $k$ of the questions on the test with a false, so we have: $$\\binom{10}{0} + \\binom{10}{1} + \\cdots + \\binom{10}{9} + \\binom{10}{10} = 2^{10}.$$ The desired answer is \\begin{align*}\n&\\binom{10}{3} + \\binom{10}{4} + \\cdots + \\binom{10}{9} + \\binom{10}{10} \\\\\n=\\text{ }&2^{10} - \\binom{10}{0} - \\binom{10}{1} - \\binom{10}{2} = 1024 - 1 - 10 - 45 \\\\\n=\\text{ }&\\boxed{968}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the number of ways to answer a 10-question true/false test with at least 3 questions answered with a false, we can use complementary counting.\n## Step 2:  We start by finding the total number of ways to answer the test without any restrictions.\n## Step 3:  Since each question can be answered as true or false, there are $2^{10} = 1024$ ways to answer the test without any restrictions.\n## Step 4:  Now, we need to find the number of ways to answer the test with at most 2 questions answered with a false.\n## Step 5:  This includes cases where 0, 1, or 2 questions are answered with a false. We can use the binomial coefficient to find the number of ways for each case.\n## Step 6:  For 0 false answers, there's only 1 way to answer all 10 questions as true.\n## Step 7:  For 1 false answer, there are $\\binom{10}{1} = 10$ ways to choose which question is answered as false.\n## Step 8:  For 2 false answers, there are $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways to choose which questions are answered as false.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the total number of ways to answer the test with at most 2 false answers is $1 + 10 + 45 = 56$.\n## Step 10:  By complementary counting, the number of ways to answer the test with at least 3 false answers is $1024 - 56 = \\boxed{968}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{968}$"
