    "problem": "How many (non-congruent) isosceles triangles exist which have a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the measure of the each of the equal sides.  Since the perimeter is 10 units, the side lengths measure $x$, $x$, and $10-2x$ units.  Since the third side length must be positive, we have $10-2x>0$ which implies $x<5$.  By the triangle inequality, the sum of the two equal sides must exceed the third side.  Solving  $x+x>10-2x$ gives $x>2.5$.  There are $\\boxed{2}$ integers strictly between 2.5 and 5.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of an isosceles triangle and what is meant by \"non-congruent\" triangles.\n## Step 2:  An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length, and the third side, which is not equal in length to the other two, is called the base.\n## Step 3:  When we talk about non-congruent triangles, we're referring to triangles that have different side lengths. This means that even if two triangles have the same perimeter, they are considered non-congruent if they have different side lengths.\n## Step 4:  Now, given that the perimeter of the isosceles triangles we're interested in is 10 and the side lengths are integers, we need to find all combinations of side lengths that satisfy these conditions.\n## Step 5:  Since an isosceles triangle has two equal sides, let's denote the length of the equal sides as x and the length of the base as y. We know that the perimeter of the triangle is 10, so we can express this as 2x + y = 10.\n## Step 6:  We also know that the length of the base (y) must be less than the sum of the other two sides (x + x), and greater than their difference (x - x). This is because the base cannot be longer than the sum of the other two sides, nor shorter than their difference.\n## Step 7:  Since we are looking for integer side lengths, we can start by considering the possible values of y that satisfy these conditions.\n## Step 8:  If y = 1, then 2x = 9, which means x is not an integer, so this case is not valid.\n## Step 9:  If y = 2, then 2x = 8, which again means x is not an integer, so this case is not valid either.\n## Step 10:  If y = 3, then 2x = 7, which again gives us a non-integer value for x, so this case is also not valid.\n## Step 11:  If y = 4, then 2x = 6, which again results in a non-integer value for x, so this case is not valid.\n## Step 12:  If y = 5, then 2x = 5, which means x is not an integer, so this case is not valid.\n## Step 13:  If y = 6, then 2x = 4, which gives us x = 2, so this case is valid.\n## Step 14:  If y = 7, then 2x = 3, which means x is not an integer, so this case is not valid.\n## Step 15:  If y = 8, then 2x = 2, which gives us x = 1, so this case is valid.\n## Step 16:  If y = 9, then 2x = 1, which means x is not an integer, so this case is not valid.\n## Step 17:  If y = 10, then 2x = 0, which again means x is not an integer, so this case is not valid.\n## Step 18:  We have found two valid cases: when y = 6 and x = 2, and when y = 8 and x = 1.\n## Step 19:  Therefore, there are two non-congruent isosceles triangles with integer side lengths and a perimeter of 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
