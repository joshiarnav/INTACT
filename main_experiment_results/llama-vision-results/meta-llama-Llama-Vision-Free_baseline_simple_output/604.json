    "problem": "I have 5 marbles numbered 1 through 5 in a bag.  Suppose I take out two different marbles at random.  What is the expected value of the product of the numbers on the marbles?  Answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ different pairs of marbles that can be drawn, and the expected value of the product is the average of the products of each pair.  This is  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{10}[(1\\times 2)&+(1\\times 3)+(1\\times 4)+(1\\times 5)+{}\\\\\n&(2\\times 3)+(2\\times 4)+(2\\times 5)+(3\\times 4)+(3\\times 5)+(4\\times 5)]\\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad=\\frac{85}{10} = \\boxed{8.5}. \\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem and the objective\nWe are asked to find the expected value of the product of the numbers on two different marbles drawn randomly from a bag containing 5 marbles numbered 1 through 5.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\nThere are 5 different marbles, and we draw 2 different marbles at random. The total number of possible outcomes can be calculated by using the combination formula: $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where n is the total number of marbles, and r is the number of marbles drawn. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = 10$.\n\n## Step 3: List all possible outcomes and their corresponding products\nLet's list all possible outcomes and their corresponding products:\n- (1, 2) with product 2\n- (1, 3) with product 3\n- (1, 4) with product 4\n- (1, 5) with product 5\n- (2, 3) with product 6\n- (2, 4) with product 8\n- (2, 5) with product 10\n- (3, 4) with product 12\n- (3, 5) with product 15\n- (4, 5) with product 20\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the expected value\nTo find the expected value, we multiply each outcome by its probability and sum them up. Since each outcome has a probability of $\\frac{1}{10}$, the expected value can be calculated as follows:\nExpected value = (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20)/10\nExpected value = 85/10\n\n## Step 5: Round the expected value to the nearest tenth\nThe expected value is 8.5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8.5}$"
