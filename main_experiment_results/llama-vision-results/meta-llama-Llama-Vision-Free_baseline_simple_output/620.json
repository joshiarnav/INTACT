    "solution": "There are nine possible products, as there are three different numbers upon which the first spinner could land and three different numbers upon which the second spinner could land. If the first spinner lands on $-3$ or $-1$, the second spinner can land on either 2 or 4 to create a negative product, giving four possibilities. If the first spinner lands on the 5, the second spinner must land on the $-6$ to create a negative product. Thus, there are five possible ways to create a negative product, so the probability that the product of the values is negative is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, we need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when both spinners are spun.\n## Step 2:  Each spinner has 3 regions, so when both spinners are spun, the total number of outcomes is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n## Step 3:  Now, we need to find the number of outcomes where the product of the two values is negative.\n## Step 4:  To have a negative product, one spinner must land on a positive value and the other on a negative value.\n## Step 5:  There are 3 negative values on the first spinner and 3 positive values on the second spinner, so the number of outcomes where the first spinner lands on a negative value and the second on a positive value is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n## Step 6:  Similarly, there are 3 positive values on the first spinner and 3 negative values on the second spinner, so the number of outcomes where the first spinner lands on a positive value and the second on a negative value is also $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the total number of outcomes where the product of the two values is negative is $9 + 9 = 18$.\n## Step 8:  However, we need to correct our approach for counting the favorable outcomes.\n## Step 9:  We should consider that a negative product can occur when one spinner lands on a negative value and the other on a positive value.\n## Step 10:  There are $3$ negative values on the first spinner and $3$ positive values on the second spinner, so the number of outcomes where the first spinner lands on a negative value and the second on a positive value is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n## Step 11:  Similarly, there are $3$ positive values on the first spinner and $3$ negative values on the second spinner, so the number of outcomes where the first spinner lands on a positive value and the second on a negative value is also $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n## Step 12:  Thus, the correct total number of favorable outcomes is indeed $9 + 9 = 18$.\n## Step 13:  But, we need to correct our understanding of what constitutes a negative product, as it can occur when one spinner lands on a negative value and the other on a positive value.\n## Step 14:  So, the number of favorable outcomes is $3 \\times 3 = 9$, as there are $3$ negative values on the first spinner and $3$ positive values on the second spinner.\n## Step 15:  Similarly, the number of favorable outcomes is also $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n## Step 16:  However, we need to subtract the case where both spinners land on the positive value, as this does not yield a negative product.\n## Step 17:  Hence, the correct number of favorable outcomes is $9 + 9 - 1 = 17$.\n## Step 18:  Therefore, the probability that the product of the two values is negative is $\\frac{17}{36}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{36}}$"
