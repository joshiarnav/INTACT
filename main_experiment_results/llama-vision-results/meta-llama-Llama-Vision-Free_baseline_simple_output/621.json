    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand what constitutes a rectangle in the given array.\n## Step 2:  A rectangle can be formed by drawing horizontal and vertical lines between the points on the grid.\n## Step 3:  We are asked to find the total number of rectangles in the array.\n## Step 4:  To do this, we can start by counting the number of squares of different sizes in the array.\n## Step 5:  There are $9$ unit squares, $4$ of which are $2$ by $2$ squares, and $1$ which is a $3$ by $3$ square.\n## Step 6:  We need to consider all possible combinations of these squares to form rectangles of different sizes.\n## Step 7:  Let's start by counting the number of squares of different sizes. There are $9$ unit squares, $4$ of which are $2$ by $2$ squares, and $1$ which is a $3$ by $3$ square.\n## Step 8:  The $9$ unit squares can be combined to form $4$ rectangles with a side length of $2$, and the $4$ squares of size $2$ can be combined to form $6$ rectangles of size $2$ by $2$.\n## Step 9:  Additionally, the $4$ squares of size $2$ can be combined with the square of size $3$ to form $4$ rectangles of size $3$ by $2$.\n## Step 10:  Furthermore, the square of size $3$ can be combined with the unit squares to form $4$ rectangles of size $3$ by $1$ and $2$ rectangles of size $3$ by $3$.\n## Step 11:  We also need to consider the cases where the unit squares are combined to form a rectangle of size $1$ by $2$ and $1$ by $3$.\n## Step 12:  Additionally, the unit squares can be combined to form $2$ rectangles of size $2$ by $3$.\n## Step 13:  Now, we can sum up the number of rectangles in each of these cases to find the total number of rectangles in the array.\n## Step 14:  By adding the counts from each case, we get a total of $9$ rectangles of size $1$ by $1$, $4$ rectangles of size $2$ by $2$, $4$ rectangles of size $3$ by $3$, $4$ rectangles of size $1$ by $2$, $4$ rectangles of size $1$ by $3$, $2$ rectangles of size $2$ by $3$, $6$ rectangles of size $2$ by $2$, $4$ rectangles of size $2$ by $3$, and $4$ rectangles of size $3$ by $2$.\n## Step 15:  Therefore, the total number of rectangles in the array is $9 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 4 = 41$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{41}$"
