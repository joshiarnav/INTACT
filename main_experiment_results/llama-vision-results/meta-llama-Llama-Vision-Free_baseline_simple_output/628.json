    "problem": "At a mall's food court, Crystal has $\\$7.50$ to buy a meal (one entree, one drink and one dessert). The table below lists Crystal's choices and their prices including sales tax. How many distinct possible meals can she afford to buy? \\[\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline\n\\text{Entrees} & \\text{Drinks} & \\text{Desserts} \\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Pizza } \\$3.50 & \\text{Lemonade } \\$1.50 & \\text{Frozen Yogurt } \\$3.00 \\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Corn Dog } \\$2.50 & \\text{Soda } \\$1.25 & \\text{Cookies } \\$2.00 \\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Fish~\\& Chips } \\$3.50 & & \\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Fried Rice } \\$4.75 & & \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{array}\\]",
    "solution": "First, notice that Crystal cannot purchase an entire meal that includes Fried Rice.  The cheapest possibility would be Fried Rice, Soda, and Cookies, which still costs 50 cents too much.  Then, looking at the Pizza option, it is not possible for Crystal to purchase Frozen Yogurt with Pizza, as that would leave only one dollar for a drink.  Thus, she can purchase 2 different meals with Pizza (Pizza, Cookies, and either drink).  Since Fish and Chips cost the same as Pizza, there are likewise 2 different possible meals with Fish and Chips.  With a Corn Dog as her entree, Crystal can buy the most expensive meal (Corn Dog, Lemonade, and Frozen Yogurt), thus, she has 4 possible meals (Corn Dog, either drink, either dessert), making for $\\boxed{8\\text{ meals}}$ total.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the budget constraint\nCrystal has $\\$7.50$ to spend on a meal, which includes one entree, one drink, and one dessert.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the maximum cost of the dessert\nTo maximize the number of distinct possible meals, we want to minimize the cost of the dessert. The cheapest dessert is Cookies, which costs $\\$2.00$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the maximum cost of the drink\nTo maximize the number of distinct possible meals, we want to minimize the cost of the drink. The cheapest drink is Soda, which costs $\\$1.25$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the maximum cost of the entree\nTo maximize the number of distinct possible meals, we want to minimize the cost of the entree. There are three options for entree: Pizza ($\\$3.50$), Corn Dog ($\\$2.50$), and Fish~\\& Chips ($\\$3.50$). We should consider the cost of the entree that will allow us to stay within the budget after purchasing the cheapest dessert and the cheapest drink.\n\n## Step 5: List the possible combinations of meals\nWe need to consider all the possible combinations of entrees, drinks, and desserts that Crystal can afford. The cost of each meal must be less than or equal to $\\$7.50$.\n\n- Option 1: Pizza ($\\$3.50$) + Soda ($\\$1.25$) + Cookies ($\\$2.00$) = $\\$6.75$\n- Option 2: Corn Dog ($\\$2.50$) + Soda ($\\$1.25$) + Cookies ($\\$2.00$) = $\\$5.75$\n- Option 3: Fish~\\& Chips ($\\$3.50$) + Soda ($\\$1.25$) + Cookies ($\\$2.00$) = $\\$6.75$\n- Option 4: Pizza ($\\$3.50$) + Lemonade ($\\$1.50$) + Cookies ($\\$2.00$) = $\\$7.00$\n- Option 5: Corn Dog ($\\$2.50$) + Lemonade ($\\$1.50$) + Cookies ($\\$2.00$) = $\\$6.00$\n- Option 6: Fish~\\& Chips ($\\$3.50$) + Lemonade ($\\$1.50$) + Cookies ($\\$2.00$) = $\\$7.00$\n- Option 7: Pizza ($\\$3.50$) + Soda ($\\$1.25$) + Frozen Yogurt ($\\$3.00$) = $\\$7.75$ (exceeds budget)\n- Option 8: Corn Dog ($\\$2.50$) + Soda ($\\$1.25$) + Frozen Yogurt ($\\$3.00$) = $\\$6.75$\n- Option 9: Fish~\\& Chips ($\\$3.50$) + Soda ($\\$1.25$) + Frozen Yogurt ($\\$3.00$) = $\\$7.75$ (exceeds budget)\n- Option 10: Pizza ($\\$3.50$) + Lemonade ($\\$1.50$) + Frozen Yogurt ($\\$3.00$) = $\\$8.00$ (exceeds budget)\n- Option 11: Corn Dog ($\\$2.50$) + Lemonade ($\\$1.50$) + Frozen Yogurt ($\\$3.00$) = $\\$7.00$\n- Option 12: Fish~\\& Chips ($\\$3.50$) + Lemonade ($\\$1.50$) + Frozen Yogurt ($\\$3.00$) = $\\$8.00$ (exceeds budget)\n\n## Step 6: Determine the number of distinct possible meals\nWe found 7 different combinations of meals that Crystal can afford.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
