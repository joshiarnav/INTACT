    "problem": "Pat wants to select 8 pieces of fruit to bring in the car for the people he's driving to Montana with. He randomly chooses each piece of fruit to be an orange, an apple, or a banana. What is the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples?",
    "solution": "It is impossible for Pat to select both 3 oranges and 6 apples, so we can calculate the probabilities of these mutually exclusive cases separately and then add to get our final answer. The probability that 3 particular pieces of fruit will be oranges and the rest will not be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^5=\\dfrac{32}{6561}$, and there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways of selecting three pieces of fruit to be the oranges so the probability that 3 will be oranges is $56\\cdot\\dfrac{32}{6561}=\\dfrac{1792}{6561}$. Similarly, the probability that 6 particular pieces of fruit will be apples and the other two won't be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^6\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{6561}$ and there are $\\binom{8}{6}=28$ ways of selecting which ones will be the apples, so multiplying again gives us a probability of $28\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{6561}=\\dfrac{112}{6561}$. Adding those two probabilities give us our final answer: $\\dfrac{1792}{6561}+\\dfrac{112}{6561}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1904}{6561}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of two mutually exclusive events: exactly 3 oranges out of 8 pieces of fruit, and exactly 6 apples out of 8 pieces of fruit.\n## Step 2:  First, we'll find the probability of exactly 3 oranges. This can be calculated using the binomial probability formula: P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the total number of trials (8 in this case), k is the number of successful trials (3 for oranges), p is the probability of success on a single trial (1/3 for oranges), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n## Step 3:  The number of combinations of 8 items taken 3 at a time is C(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!) = 56.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, the probability of exactly 3 oranges is P(X = 3) = C(8, 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^5 = 56 * (1/27) * (32/243) = 224/729.\n## Step 5:  Next, we'll find the probability of exactly 6 apples. Similarly, this can be calculated using the binomial probability formula: P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the total number of trials (8 in this case), k is the number of successful trials (6 for apples), p is the probability of success on a single trial (1/3 for apples), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n## Step 6:  The number of combinations of 8 items taken 6 at a time is C(8, 6) = 8! / (6! * (8-6)!) = 28.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the probability of exactly 6 apples is P(X = 6) = C(8, 6) * (1/3)^6 * (2/3)^2 = 28 * (1/729) * (4/9) = 112/2187.\n## Step 8:  Since these are mutually exclusive events, we can add the probabilities together to find the total probability: P(exactly 3 oranges or exactly 6 apples) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 6) = 224/729 + 112/2187.\n## Step 9:  To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 729 and 2187 is 2187. So, we'll convert the fraction 224/729 to have a denominator of 2187: 224/729 * 3/3 = 672/2187.\n## Step 10:  Now we can add the fractions: P(exactly 3 oranges or exactly 6 apples) = 672/2187 + 112/2187 = 784/2187.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples is 784/2187.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{784}{2187}}$"
