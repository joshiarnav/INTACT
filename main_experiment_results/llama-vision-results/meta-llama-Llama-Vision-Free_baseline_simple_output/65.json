    "problem": "Beth rolls a fair six-sided die. If she rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar, but if she rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar. If she rolls 1 nothing happens. What is the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are 3 possible prime numbers which can be rolled (2, 3, and 5), and two possible composite numbers which can be rolled (4 and 6). Each number has a $\\dfrac{1}{6}$ chance of being rolled. So, the expected value of Beth's winnings is $$\\frac{3}{6}(1)+\\frac{2}{6}(-1)+\\frac{1}{6}(0)=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the possible outcomes when Beth rolls the die.\nBeth can roll a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the prime numbers in the possible outcomes.\nThe prime numbers in the possible outcomes are 2, 3, and 5.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the composite numbers in the possible outcomes.\nThe composite numbers in the possible outcomes are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of rolling a prime number.\nThere are 3 prime numbers and 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling a prime number is 3/6 = 1/2.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of rolling a composite number.\nThere are 2 composite numbers and 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling a composite number is 2/6 = 1/3.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of rolling 1.\nThere is 1 outcome where Beth rolls a 1 and 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling 1 is 1/6.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the amount of money Beth wins or loses for each outcome.\nBeth wins $1 for rolling a prime number, loses $1 for rolling a composite number, and wins $0 for rolling a 1.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the expected value.\nThe expected value is calculated by multiplying the amount of money won or lost by the probability of each outcome and then adding the results.\nExpected value = (Probability of prime number) * ($1) + (Probability of composite number) * (-$1) + (Probability of rolling 1) * ($0)\nExpected value = (1/2) * $1 + (1/3) * (-$1) + (1/6) * $0\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the expected value calculation.\nExpected value = $1/2 - $1/3\nTo subtract fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6 in this case.\nExpected value = $3/6 - $2/6\nExpected value = $1/6\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$"
