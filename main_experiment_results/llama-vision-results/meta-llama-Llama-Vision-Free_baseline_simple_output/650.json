    "problem": "Our basketball team has 10 players.  We need to divide into two teams of 5 for an intra-squad scrimmage.  In how many ways can we do this without restrictions?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{10}{5} = 252$ ways to choose players for the first team, and the second team gets the remaining players.  However, since the teams are interchangeable, we must divide by two, so the answer is $252 / 2 = \\boxed{126}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To determine the number of ways we can divide the 10 basketball players into two teams of 5 without any restrictions, we first need to understand that each player has two options for the team they can join.\n## Step 2:  Since there are 10 players and each needs to choose a team, we can calculate the total number of ways to form the teams using the concept of combinations.\n## Step 3:  The first player has 2 choices of teams, and the second player also has 2 choices, and so on, until the tenth player, who also has 2 choices.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, each player's choices can be expressed as 2 choices, repeated 10 times, resulting in $2^{10}$.\n## Step 5:  However, we need to account for the fact that we're dividing the players into two identical teams, which means that the order of the teams doesn't matter.\n## Step 6:  This means we're essentially counting each unique division twice, once for each possible ordering of the two teams.\n## Step 7:  To correct for this, we need to divide the total number of ways by 2, resulting in $\\dfrac{2^{10}}{2}$.\n## Step 8:  Simplifying this gives us $2^{9}$, which is equal to $512$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{512}$"
