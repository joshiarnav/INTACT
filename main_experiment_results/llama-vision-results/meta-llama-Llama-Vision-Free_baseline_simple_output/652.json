    "problem": "Matt and Ryan are playing an exciting round of Rock Paper Scissors: The Collectible Card Game. Matt is convinced that Rock can beat anything, so his deck consists only of 8 Rock cards.   Ryan's deck consists of 5 Paper cards and 3 Scissors cards.  In the game, Matt randomly selects 3 cards from his deck and places them on the table.  Ryan then randomly selects 3 cards and places one on each of Matt's cards.  If Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock, then what's the probability that Ryan beats Matt in a landslide by choosing 3 Paper cards in a row?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ equally likely ways for Ryan to pick 3 of his 8 cards to play. There are are $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways for those 3 cards to be 3 of his 5 paper cards. So, the probability that he picks 3 paper cards  is $\\frac{\\text{successful outcomes}}{\\text{total equally-likely outcomes}} = \\frac{10}{56}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{28}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the probability of Ryan selecting 3 Paper cards.\nRyan has 5 Paper cards and 3 Scissors cards, for a total of 8 cards. He must select 3 cards, so we use the combination formula to find the probability that he selects 3 Paper cards: $\\frac{\\binom{5}{3}}{\\binom{8}{3}}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the combination values for step 1.\n$\\binom{5}{3}=\\frac{5!}{3!2!}=10$ and $\\binom{8}{3}=\\frac{8!}{3!5!}=56$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of Ryan selecting 3 Paper cards.\n$\\frac{\\binom{5}{3}}{\\binom{8}{3}}=\\frac{10}{56}=\\frac{5}{28}$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the probability that Ryan's Paper beats Matt's Rock.\nFor Ryan to beat Matt in a landslide, all three of Ryan's cards must be Paper and all three of Matt's cards must be Rock.  Since Matt has 8 Rock cards, the probability of him randomly selecting 3 Rock cards is $\\frac{\\binom{8}{3}}{\\binom{8}{3}}=1$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the probability of Ryan's Paper beating Matt's Rock.\nSince there is a 1 in 3 chance that Ryan's Paper beats Matt's Rock, the probability that Ryan's Paper beats Matt's Rock three times in a row is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{27}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability that Ryan beats Matt in a landslide.\nSince the probability that Ryan selects 3 Paper cards and the probability that Ryan's Paper beats Matt's Rock are independent events, we can find the probability that Ryan beats Matt in a landslide by multiplying the probabilities of these two events: $\\frac{5}{28} \\times \\frac{1}{27}$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the final probability.\n$\\frac{5}{28} \\times \\frac{1}{27}=\\frac{5}{756}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{756}}$"
