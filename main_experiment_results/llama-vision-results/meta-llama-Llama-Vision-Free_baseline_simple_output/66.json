    "problem": "A player pays $\\$5$ to play a game. A six-sided die is rolled. If the number on the die is odd, the game is lost. If the number on the die is even, the die is rolled again. In this case the player wins some amount of money if the second number matches the first and loses otherwise. How much money should the player win if the game is fair? (In a fair game the probability of winning times the amount won is what the player should pay.)",
    "solution": "Let $x$ represent the amount the player wins if the game is fair.  The chance of an even number is $1/2$, and the chance of matching this number on the second roll is $1/6$. So the probability of winning is $(1/2)(1/6)=1/12$. Therefore $(1/12)x=\\$5$ and $x=\\boxed{60}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the probability of losing the game immediately after the first roll.\nThe probability of losing the game immediately after the first roll is the probability of rolling an odd number. Since a six-sided die has three odd numbers (1, 3, and 5) out of six possible outcomes, the probability of rolling an odd number is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the probability of winning or losing after the second roll.\nThe probability of winning after the second roll is the probability of rolling an even number first (which forces a second roll) and then rolling the same even number again. There are three even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, and 6), so the probability of rolling an even number first is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$. The probability of rolling the same even number again is $\\frac{1}{6}$ because there is only one specific even number to match out of six possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of winning after the second roll is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the probability of losing after the second roll.\nTo lose after the second roll, the player must roll an even number first and then roll an odd number. The probability of rolling an even number first is $\\frac{1}{2}$. The probability of rolling an odd number after an even number is also $\\frac{1}{2}$ because there are three odd numbers and three even numbers on the die, making each outcome equally likely. Therefore, the probability of losing after the second roll is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the overall probability of winning the game.\nThe overall probability of winning the game includes winning immediately after the first roll (which there is no chance of) and winning after the second roll. Since the player loses immediately after the first roll with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$, we exclude this from our winning probability. Therefore, the overall probability of winning is $\\frac{1}{12}$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the overall probability of losing the game.\nThe overall probability of losing the game includes losing immediately after the first roll and losing after the second roll. The probability of losing immediately after the first roll is $\\frac{1}{2}$. The probability of losing after the second roll is $\\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, the overall probability of losing is $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the amount the player should win if the game is fair.\nIn a fair game, the probability of winning times the amount won equals the cost of playing the game. The probability of winning is $\\frac{1}{12}$, and the cost of playing the game is $\\$5$. To find the amount the player should win, we set up the equation $\\frac{1}{12} \\times \\text{amount won} = 5$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for the amount won.\nSolving the equation $\\frac{1}{12} \\times \\text{amount won} = 5$ for the amount won, we get $\\text{amount won} = 5 \\times 12 = 60$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{60}$"
