    "problem": "What is the greatest common factor of 5!, 10!, and 15!?",
    "solution": "Note that $5!$ divides $10!$ and $5!$ divides $15!$.  Since $5!$ has no factor larger than $5!$, and $5!$ is a factor of all three, the answer is $5!=\\boxed{120}$.",

This means that 5! is a common factor of 10! and 15!. Therefore, the greatest common factor is 5!.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the greatest common factor\n5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{120}$"
