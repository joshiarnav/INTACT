    "problem": "The Greek army contained two types of soldiers: the upper class and the lower class soldiers. If there were a total of 5 upper class soldiers, and 10 lower class soldiers in a certain part of Athens, and the battle of Thermopylae demands a force of 4 upper class soldiers and 8 lower class soldiers, how many different battalions can be sent?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{4}$ different ways to choose 4 from 5 upper class soldiers. For each of these, there are $\\binom{10}{8}$ ways to choose 8 lower class soldiers. The number of different battalions, then, is $\\binom{5}{4}\\cdot \\binom{10}{8} = \\boxed{225}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of battalions that can be formed with only upper class soldiers.\nThere are 5 upper class soldiers, but each battalion requires 4 upper class soldiers. To find out how many battalions can be formed with only upper class soldiers, we divide the total number of upper class soldiers by the number required per battalion: 5 / 4 = 1.25. Since we cannot have a fraction of a battalion, it's not possible to form a battalion with only upper class soldiers that meets the required ratio.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of battalions that can be formed with only lower class soldiers.\nThere are 10 lower class soldiers, and each battalion requires 8 lower class soldiers. To find out how many battalions can be formed with only lower class soldiers, we divide the total number of lower class soldiers by the number required per battalion: 10 / 8 = 1.25. Since we cannot have a fraction of a battalion, it's not possible to form a battalion with only lower class soldiers that meets the required ratio.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of battalions that can be formed by combining upper and lower class soldiers to meet the required force.\nSince it's not possible to form a complete battalion with only upper or only lower class soldiers, we need to consider combinations. However, the problem statement does not specify that we must use all available soldiers. Instead, it asks how many different battalions can be sent. Given that each battalion requires 4 upper and 8 lower class soldiers, and we have 5 upper and 10 lower class soldiers, we can calculate the number of battalions by dividing the available soldiers by the soldiers needed per battalion: 5 upper / 4 = 1.25 and 10 lower / 8 = 1.25. But since we can't have fractions, we have only one complete combination: 4 upper and 8 lower class soldiers, which forms one battalion. However, this is not the complete answer since we have extra soldiers that could be combined in another way.\n\n## Step 4: Determine if there are any other combinations of soldiers that could form a battalion.\nGiven that the problem statement asks for how many different battalions can be sent, and considering we have extra soldiers, we can form an additional battalion with the remaining soldiers. However, we are limited by the smallest ratio of 4 upper to 8 lower class soldiers. We cannot form another complete battalion with the remaining soldiers because there are not enough upper class soldiers to form another complete group of 4, and we are limited by the requirement for the upper class soldiers.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of battalions that can be sent.\nBased on the previous steps, we can form a total of 1 battalion with the exact required number of soldiers, and no additional complete battalions can be formed due to the limitation of the smallest ratio of soldiers required per battalion.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
