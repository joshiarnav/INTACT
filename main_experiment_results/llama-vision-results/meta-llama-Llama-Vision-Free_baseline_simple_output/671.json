    "solution": "For the ball to end up back in the center, the ball must deflect left 4 of the 8 times, and right the other 4 times. There are $\\binom{8}{4}$ ways to pick which 4 of the rows to deflect the ball left and then the other 4 to deflect it right.  Each deflection is to the left with probability $\\frac12$ and to the right with probability $\\frac12$, so each possible path to the bottom occurs with probability $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!8}$.  Thus, the probability that 4 out of 8 deflections go left and the ball goes in the middle is \\[\\binom{8}{4}\\frac{1}{2^8}=\\boxed{\\frac{35}{128}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the nature of the game of Plinko and the rules governing the ball's movement.\n## Step 2:  The game is played by dropping a ball at the top-middle of a set of pegs. Each time the ball hits a peg, it has a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability of deflecting either to the left or to the right.\n## Step 3:  Our goal is to find the probability that the ball lands in the middle slot as shown in the diagram.\n## Step 4:  We can simplify the problem by considering the ball's movement as a series of independent events. At each peg, the ball has a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance of going left or right. This means that the ball's trajectory can be represented as a sequence of lefts and rights.\n## Step 5:  Since there are 7 pegs and 8 slots, we can represent the ball's movement using a 7-digit sequence of Rs and Ls, where R represents a move to the right and L represents a move to the left.\n## Step 6:  For the ball to land in the middle slot, it must move to the left at every other peg, resulting in a sequence of 4 Rs and 3 Ls.\n## Step 7:  We can calculate the total number of possible sequences using the binomial coefficient, denoted as $\\binom{n}{k}$, which represents the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n distinct items without regard to the order.\n## Step 8:  In this case, there are $\\binom{7}{3}$ possible sequences of 7 digits containing 3 Ls and 4 Rs.\n## Step 9:  Since each sequence has a probability of $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{7}$, the probability of reaching the middle slot is given by $\\frac{\\binom{7}{3}}{2^7}$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the probability that the ball lands in the middle slot is $\\frac{\\binom{7}{3}}{2^7}=\\frac{35}{128}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{35}{128}}$"
