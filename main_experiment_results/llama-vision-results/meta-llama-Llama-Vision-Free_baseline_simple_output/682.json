    "problem": "There are eight boys and six girls who are members of the trumpet section in the band. From the members of the trumpet section, a quintet is being formed. If the quintet must consist of three boys and two girls, how many quintets are possible?",
    "solution": "First, we consider how many ways there are to choose three boys from eight. There are $8$ choices for the first boy, $7$ for the second, and $6$ for the third. However, because the boys are indistinct from one another, we have overcounted, and must divide by $3 \\cdot 2$. Similarly, there are $6 \\cdot 5$ ways to choose the two girls, divided by $2$ for overcounting. Thus, there are $\\frac{8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2} = \\boxed{840}$ possible quintets.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 8 boys\nTo choose 3 boys from 8 boys, we can use the combination formula $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of boys and $k$ is the number of boys we want to choose. So, $C(8, 3) = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3!5!}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 8 boys\nWe calculate the factorial of each number: $8! = 40320$, $3! = 6$, and $5! = 120$. Then we plug these values into the combination formula: $C(8, 3) = \\frac{40320}{6 \\cdot 120} = \\frac{40320}{720} = 56$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 6 girls\nTo choose 2 girls from 6 girls, we use the combination formula again. $C(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6!}{2!4!}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 6 girls\nWe calculate the factorial of each number: $6! = 720$, $2! = 2$, and $4! = 24$. Then we plug these values into the combination formula: $C(6, 2) = \\frac{720}{2 \\cdot 24} = \\frac{720}{48} = 15$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of quintets\nThe total number of quintets is the product of the number of ways to choose 3 boys and 2 girls. Total quintets = $56 \\cdot 15$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the product\nTotal quintets = $56 \\cdot 15 = 840$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{840}$"
