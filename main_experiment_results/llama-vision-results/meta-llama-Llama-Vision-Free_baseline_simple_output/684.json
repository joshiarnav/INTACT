    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if the three E's are unique, which is $5!$. Then since the E's are not unique, we divide by $3!$ for the arrangements of E, for an answer of $\\dfrac{5!}{3!} = \\boxed{20}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem requires us to find the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word \"TEPEE\".\n## Step 2:  The word \"TEPEE\" has 5 letters, with two Es repeated.\n## Step 3:  To calculate the number of arrangements, we can use the formula for permutations of a set with repeated elements, which is n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!), where n is the total number of elements, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the frequencies of each repeated element.\n## Step 4:  In this case, we have 5 letters in total, with 2 Es repeated.\n## Step 5:  Applying the formula, we get 5! / 2! to account for the repeated Es.\n## Step 6:  Calculating 5! gives us 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120, and 2! gives us 2 * 1 = 2.\n## Step 7:  So, the total number of arrangements is 120 / 2 = 60.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, there are 60 ways to arrange the letters of the word \"TEPEE\".\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{60}$"
