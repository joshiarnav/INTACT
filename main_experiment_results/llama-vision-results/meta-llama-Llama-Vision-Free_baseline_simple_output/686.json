    "problem": "Julie baked cupcakes for her family at home and for a party at school. She iced 4 cupcakes with red frosting, 2 cupcakes with orange frosting, 2 with yellow, 2 with green, 3 with blue and the last 3 with violet frosting. Each cupcake is iced with exactly one color of frosting. Julie plans to take exactly 10 of the cupcakes to her party, and will take either all of the cupcakes of a particular color or none of the cupcakes of that color. How many different combinations of cupcakes could she take to her party?",
    "solution": "If Julie includes one of the colors that cover three cupcakes, she must also include the other color that covers three cupcakes. This is because she must make ten cupcakes total, and all of the other colors cover an even number of cupcakes, so there is no way to make ten with three and some combination of even numbers. Thus, if she includes blue and violet, she has four cupcakes left to choose. There are three ways in which she can choose four cupcakes if she chooses colors that cover two (green and orange, green and yellow, or orange and yellow). Alternately, she can choose a color that covers four (red). Finally, if she doesn't include any colors that cover three cupcakes, she must choose all of the other cupcakes in order to make ten. Thus, Julie has $\\boxed{5}$ different combinations of cupcakes.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of cupcakes of each color that Julie can take to her party.\nJulie has 4 red, 2 orange, 2 yellow, 2 green, 3 blue, and 3 violet cupcakes.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of combinations for each color of cupcakes that Julie can take to her party.\nFor red, she can take 0 or 4 cupcakes.\nFor orange, she can take 0 or 2 cupcakes.\nFor yellow, she can take 0 or 2 cupcakes.\nFor green, she can take 0 or 2 cupcakes.\nFor blue, she can take 0 or 3 cupcakes.\nFor violet, she can take 0 or 3 cupcakes.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of combinations.\nThere are 2 choices for red, 2 for orange, 2 for yellow, 2 for green, 2 for blue, and 2 for violet, giving a total of $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 64$ combinations.\n\n## Step 4:  A more efficient way to find the number of combinations is to consider that Julie needs to take exactly 10 cupcakes to her party. She can take cupcakes of the following color combinations: 4 red, 2 orange, 2 yellow, 2 green; 4 red, 2 orange, 2 yellow, 1 green, 1 blue; 4 red, 2 orange, 2 yellow, 1 green, 2 blue; 4 red, 2 orange, 2 yellow, 3 blue; 4 red, 2 orange, 2 yellow, 2 violet; 4 red, 2 orange, 2 yellow, 3 violet; 4 red, 2 orange, 2 yellow, 2 violet, 1 blue; 4 red, 2 orange, 2 yellow, 2 violet, 2 blue; 4 red, 2 orange, 2 yellow, 2 violet, 3 blue; 2 orange, 2 yellow, 2 green, 4 blue; 2 orange, 2 yellow, 2 green, 3 violet; 2 orange, 2 yellow, 2 green, 2 violet, 2 blue; 2 orange, 2 yellow, 2 green, 2 violet, 3 blue; 2 orange, 2 yellow, 3 blue, 4 violet; 2 orange, 2 yellow, 3 blue, 3 violet; 2 orange, 2 yellow, 2 violet, 3 violet; 2 orange, 3 blue, 4 violet; 2 orange, 3 blue, 3 violet.\n\n## Step 5: The number of combinations in step 4 is 15.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
