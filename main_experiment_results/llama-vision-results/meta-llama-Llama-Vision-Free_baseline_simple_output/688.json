    "problem": "How many 3-digit numbers have a first digit which is triple the final digit?",
    "solution": "There are only three possibilities for the first digit: \\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\\hline\n\\text{First digit} & \\text{Last digit} \\\\ \\hline\n3 & 1 \\\\ \\hline\n6 & 2 \\\\ \\hline\n9 & 3 \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\] The middle digit can be any of the $10$ digits. The answer is $3\\times 10=\\boxed{30}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We need to determine the number of 3-digit numbers where the first digit is triple the final digit.\n## Step 2:  To approach this, we should consider all possible combinations of the first and last digits, as these determine the middle digit.\n## Step 3:  We know that the first digit must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 9, and the final digit must be at least 1 and at most 9.\n## Step 4:  This means that the final digit can be any number from 1 to 9, since it's non-zero to form a 3-digit number.\n## Step 5:  Considering these constraints, we need to list out the possibilities for the first and last digits, keeping in mind that the first digit is triple the last digit.\n## Step 6:  If the last digit is 1, then the first digit is 3. If the last digit is 2, then the first digit is 6. If the last digit is 3, then the first digit is 9. If the last digit is 4, then the first digit is 12, which is not possible for a single digit.\n## Step 7:  For the last digit being 5 or more, the first digit will be 15 or greater, which cannot be a single digit.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the valid possibilities are (1, 3), (2, 6), and (3, 9).\n## Step 9:  So, the total number of valid 3-digit numbers is 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
