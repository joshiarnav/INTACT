    "problem": "A club has 20 members, 12 boys and 8 girls.  Two of the members are chosen at random.  What is the probability that a boy and a girl are chosen?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{20}{2} = 190$ ways to choose two members of the group. There are $12$ ways to choose a boy and $8$ ways to choose a girl for a total of $12 \\cdot 8 = 96$ ways to choose a boy and a girl.  This means that there is a $\\dfrac{96}{190} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{48}{95}}$ chance that the two random members of the group are a boy and a girl.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 members out of 20.\nTo find the total number of ways to choose 2 members out of 20, we use the combination formula: $C(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$. Here, n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 20 and r = 2.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the combination formula for the total number of ways to choose 2 members out of 20.\n$C(20, 2) = \\frac{20!}{2!(20-2)!} = \\frac{20*19}{2} = 190$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 1 boy out of 12 and 1 girl out of 8.\nTo choose 1 boy out of 12, we use the combination formula again: $C(12, 1) = \\frac{12!}{1!(12-1)!} = 12$.\nSimilarly, to choose 1 girl out of 8: $C(8, 1) = \\frac{8!}{1!(8-1)!} = 8$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 1 boy and 1 girl.\nThe total number of ways to choose 1 boy and 1 girl is the product of the number of ways to choose 1 boy and the number of ways to choose 1 girl: $12 * 8 = 96$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that a boy and a girl are chosen.\nThe probability that a boy and a girl are chosen is the number of ways to choose 1 boy and 1 girl divided by the total number of ways to choose 2 members: $\\frac{96}{190}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the fraction.\n$\\frac{96}{190} = \\frac{48}{95}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{48}{95}}$"
