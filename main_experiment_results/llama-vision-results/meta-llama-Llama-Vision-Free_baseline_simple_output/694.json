    "problem": "I coach a soccer team with 15 members.  I want to choose a starting lineup consisting of 11 players, two of whom will represent the team in the captains meeting at the beginning of the game.  In how many ways can I choose my starting lineup, including designating the two captains?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{15}{2}=105$ ways to select the 2 captains from among the 15 players on the team. We then need to choose the remaining 9 starters from among the remaining 13 players, which can be done in $\\binom{13}{9}=715$ ways. This gives us a total of $\\binom{15}{2}\\cdot\\binom{13}{9}=105\\cdot715=\\boxed{75,\\!075}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to choose 11 players from 15 members without considering the captains' positions.\nTo do this, we will use the combination formula, which calculates the number of ways to choose k items from a group of n items without regard to the order of selection. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n - k)!], where \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. For this step, we need to calculate C(15, 11).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate C(15, 11) to find out how many ways we can choose 11 players from 15 members.\nC(15, 11) = 15! / [11!(15 - 11)!] = 15! / (11! * 4!) = (15 * 14 * 13 * 12) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) because the factorials in the numerator and the denominator cancel out all but the first four numbers in the numerator. This simplifies to 1365.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to choose 2 captains from the 11 chosen players.\nThis is also a combination problem, where we need to choose 2 captains from the 11 players selected. We will use the combination formula again: C(11, 2).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate C(11, 2) to find out how many ways we can choose 2 captains from 11 players.\nC(11, 2) = 11! / [2!(11 - 2)!] = 11! / (2! * 9!) = (11 * 10) / (2 * 1) because the factorials in the numerator and the denominator cancel out all but the first two numbers in the numerator. This simplifies to 55.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of ways to choose the starting lineup, including designating the two captains.\nThis is done by multiplying the number of ways to choose 11 players from 15 members by the number of ways to choose 2 captains from the 11 players. Total ways = C(15, 11) * C(11, 2).\n\n## Step 6: Compute the product of C(15, 11) and C(11, 2) to get the final answer.\nTotal ways = 1365 * 55 = 75075.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{75075}$"
