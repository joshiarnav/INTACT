    "problem": "A 12-slice pizza was made with only pepperoni and mushroom toppings, and every slice has at least one topping. Only five slices have pepperoni, and exactly eight slices have mushrooms. How many slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms?",
    "solution": "There are 12 total slices, and 5 of them have pepperoni and 8 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number that have both toppings. So, there are $5-n$ slices with only pepperoni and $8-n$ with only mushrooms.  So, there are a total of $n + (5-n) + (8-n)$ slices.  Since there are 12 slices, we have $(5-n) + (8-n) + n = 12$, from which we find that $n=\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the total number of slices and the number of slices with each topping\nThere are 12 slices in total. Five slices have pepperoni, and eight slices have mushrooms.\n\n## Step 2: Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate the number of slices with both toppings\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for two sets, the number of elements in the union of the sets is the sum of the number of elements in each set, minus the number of elements in the intersection of the sets. In this case, if we let P be the set of slices with pepperoni and M be the set of slices with mushrooms, then |P \u222a M| = |P| + |M| - |P \u2229 M|.\n\n## Step 3: Plug in the known values into the formula from step 2\n|P \u222a M| = 12, |P| = 5, and |M| = 8. We can now substitute these values into the formula from step 2 to find |P \u2229 M|.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of slices with both toppings\n|P \u222a M| = |P| + |M| - |P \u2229 M|\n12 = 5 + 8 - |P \u2229 M|\n12 = 13 - |P \u2229 M|\n|P \u2229 M| = 13 - 12\n|P \u2229 M| = 1\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
