    "problem": "How many 5-digit numbers have at least one 2 or one 3 among their digits?",
    "solution": "A 5-digit number can have for its leftmost digit anything from 1 to 9 inclusive, and for each of its next four digits anything from 0 through 9 inclusive. Thus there are $9\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10=90,\\!000$ 5-digit numbers.\n\nA 5-digit number with no 2 or 3 as a digit can have for its first digit 1 or anything from 4 through 9, and can have for each other digit any of those numbers or 0.\n\nThere are $7 \\times 8\\times 8\\times 8\\times 8=28,\\!672$ such 5-digit numbers. Therefore the number of 5-digit numbers with at least one 2 or one 3 as a digit is  $90,\\!000-28,\\!672=\\boxed{61,328}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of 5-digit numbers without restrictions\nFirst, we need to find out how many 5-digit numbers exist in total without any restrictions on their digits. Since the first digit cannot be zero, there are 9 choices for the first digit (1-9) and 10 choices for each of the remaining 4 digits (0-9).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of 5-digit numbers without a 2 or 3 among their digits\nNext, we need to calculate how many 5-digit numbers do not have a 2 or a 3 among their digits. For the first digit, there are 7 choices (1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) since we exclude 2 and 3. For each of the other 4 digits, there are 8 choices (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) since we also exclude 2 and 3.\n\n## Step 3: Subtract the number of 5-digit numbers without a 2 or 3 from the total number of 5-digit numbers\nTo find the number of 5-digit numbers with at least one 2 or one 3 among their digits, we subtract the number of 5-digit numbers without a 2 or 3 from the total number of 5-digit numbers.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the calculations\nThe total number of 5-digit numbers without restrictions is 9 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 90,000.\nThe number of 5-digit numbers without a 2 or 3 is 7 * 8 * 8 * 8 * 8 = 32,768.\nTherefore, the number of 5-digit numbers with at least one 2 or one 3 among their digits is 90,000 - 32,768 = 57,232.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57232}$"
