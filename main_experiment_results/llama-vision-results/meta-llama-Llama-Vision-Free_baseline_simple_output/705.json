    "problem": "Mr. Cole needs to select 3 girls and 5 boys to go on a backpacking trip. In how many ways can he do this if 6 girls and 11 boys are interested in going on the trip?",
    "solution": "In this problem, Mr. Cole is really selecting two separate groups.  He can choose 3 girls from the 6 girls total in $$ \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20 $$ways, and 5 boys from the 11 boys total in $$ \\binom{11}{5} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 462 $$ways.  Since these two selections are independent (since for each of the 20 ways to pick the girls, there are 462 ways to pick the boys), we multiply them together to get the number of ways that we can form the 8-member trip: $$ \\binom{6}{3}\\binom{11}{5} = (20)(462) = \\boxed{9,\\!240}. $$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to select the girls.\nMr. Cole needs to select 3 girls out of 6. This can be calculated using the combination formula, which is given by C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to select.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to select 3 girls out of 6.\nUsing the combination formula, we get C(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 6! / (3!3!) = (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 20.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to select the boys.\nMr. Cole needs to select 5 boys out of 11. This can also be calculated using the combination formula.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to select 5 boys out of 11.\nUsing the combination formula, we get C(11, 5) = 11! / (5!(11-5)!) = 11! / (5!6!) = (11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7) / (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 462.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of ways to select the group.\nThe total number of ways to select the group is the product of the number of ways to select the girls and the number of ways to select the boys. Total ways = C(6, 3) \u00d7 C(11, 5) = 20 \u00d7 462.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of ways to select the group.\nTotal ways = 20 \u00d7 462 = 9240.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9240}$"
