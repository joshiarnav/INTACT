    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 2 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes?",
    "solution": "Since both the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, we can arrange them with 5 in one and 0 in the other, 4 in one and 1 in the other, or 3 in one and 2 in the other, for a total of $\\boxed{3}$ different arrangements.",
    "total_tokens": 300,

    "file_name": "./MATH/test/counting_and_probability/71.json",
    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem involves distributing 5 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes. This means that the order and identity of the boxes and the balls do not matter.\n## Step 2:  Since the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, we can simplify this problem by considering the possible distributions of the balls into the boxes. The possible distributions are: (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), and (5, 0).\n## Step 3:  However, because the boxes are indistinguishable, the distributions (0, 5) and (5, 0) are the same, as are the distributions (1, 4) and (4, 1), and the distributions (2, 3) and (3, 2).\n## Step 4:  This means that there are only 2 distinct distributions: (0, 5) and (1, 4), (2, 3).\n## Step 5:  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{2}$ ways to put 5 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
