    "problem": "Bin $A$ has one white ball and four black balls.  Bin $B$ has three balls labeled $\\$1$ and one ball labeled $\\$7$.  Bin $W$ has five balls labeled $\\$8$ and one ball labeled $\\$500$.  A game is played as follows: a ball is randomly selected from bin $A$.  If it is black, then a ball is randomly selected from bin $B$; otherwise, if the original ball is white, then a ball is randomly selected from bin $W$.  You win the amount printed on the second ball selected.  What is your expected win?",
    "solution": "Since Bin $A$ has one white ball and four black balls, the money ball has a $\\dfrac{1}{5}$ chance of coming from Bin $W$ and a $\\dfrac{4}{5}$ chance of coming from Bin $B$.  The total expected value therefore is $E = \\dfrac{1}{5}E_W + \\dfrac{4}{5}E_B$, where $E_W$ and $E_B$ are the expected values of a ball drawn from bins $W$ and $B$, respectively.  Since Bin $W$ has five 8 dollar balls and one 500 dollar ball, its expected value is \\[ E_W = \\frac{5}{6}\\times\\$8 + \\frac{1}{6}\\times\\$500 = \\$90. \\]Since Bin $B$ has three 1 dollar balls and one 7 dollar ball, its expected value is \\[ E_B = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\$1 + \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\$7 = \\$2.5. \\]Therefore \\[ E = \\frac{1}{5}E_W + \\frac{4}{5}E_B = \\frac{1}{5}(\\$90) + \\frac{4}{5}(\\$2.5) = \\boxed{\\$20}. \\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem involves calculating the expected win from a game that involves randomly selecting balls from three different bins, A, B, and W, based on certain conditions.\n## Step 2:  First, let's break down the process into two scenarios based on the color of the ball selected from bin A.\n## Step 3:  If a black ball is selected from bin A, a ball is then randomly selected from bin B. Bin B contains three balls labeled $\\$1$ and one ball labeled $\\$7$.\n## Step 4:  The probability of selecting a black ball from bin A is $\\dfrac{4}{5}$, and the probability of selecting a ball worth $\\$1$ from bin B is $\\dfrac{3}{4}$.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the probability of winning $\\$1$ is $\\dfrac{4}{5} \\times \\dfrac{3}{4} = \\dfrac{3}{5}$.\n## Step 6:  Similarly, the probability of winning $\\$7$ is $\\dfrac{4}{5} \\times \\dfrac{1}{4} = \\dfrac{1}{5}$.\n## Step 7:  Next, if a white ball is selected from bin A, a ball is then randomly selected from bin W. Bin W contains five balls labeled $\\$8$ and one ball labeled $\\$500$.\n## Step 8:  The probability of selecting a white ball from bin A is $\\dfrac{1}{5}$, and the probability of selecting a ball worth $\\$8$ from bin W is $\\dfrac{5}{6}$.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the probability of winning $\\$8$ is $\\dfrac{1}{5} \\times \\dfrac{5}{6} = \\dfrac{1}{6}$.\n## Step 10:  Similarly, the probability of winning $\\$500$ is $\\dfrac{1}{5} \\times \\dfrac{1}{6} = \\dfrac{1}{30}$.\n## Step 11:  Now, we can calculate the expected value of winning by multiplying each possible win by its corresponding probability and summing them up.\n## Step 12:  The expected value of winning is $\\dfrac{3}{5} \\cdot 1 + \\dfrac{1}{5} \\cdot 7 + \\dfrac{1}{6} \\cdot 8 + \\dfrac{1}{30} \\cdot 500$.\n## Step 13:  Simplifying the expression, we get $\\dfrac{3}{5} + \\dfrac{7}{5} + \\dfrac{8}{6} + \\dfrac{500}{30}$.\n## Step 14:  Further simplification yields $\\dfrac{3}{5} + \\dfrac{7}{5} + \\dfrac{4}{3} + \\dfrac{50}{3}$.\n## Step 15:  Combining the terms, we get $\\dfrac{6}{5} + \\dfrac{8}{3}$.\n## Step 16:  To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is $15$.\n## Step 17:  Converting the fractions to have a common denominator, we get $\\dfrac{6}{5} \\cdot \\dfrac{3}{3} + \\dfrac{8}{3} \\cdot \\dfrac{5}{5} = \\dfrac{18}{15} + \\dfrac{40}{15}$.\n## Step 18:  Adding the fractions, we get $\\dfrac{18}{15} + \\dfrac{40}{15} = \\dfrac{58}{15}$.\n## Step 19:  Therefore, the expected value of winning is $\\dfrac{58}{15}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{58}{15}}$"
