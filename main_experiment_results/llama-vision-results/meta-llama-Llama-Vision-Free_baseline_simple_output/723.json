    "problem": "I have an unfair coin that lands as heads with probability of $\\dfrac{2}{3}$. If I flip the coin 5 times, what is the probability that I get exactly two heads?",
    "solution": "We need exactly two flips to come up heads and three to come up tails. The odds that two flips come up heads is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2$ and the odds that the other three all come up tails is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3$. We then need to consider the distinct ways of positioning the heads among the 5 flips: we can put the first one in any of 5 places and the second one in any of the remaining 4 places, but they aren't distinct so we need divide by 2 for a total of $\\dfrac{5\\times4}{2}=10$ ways. Thus the probability is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2\\times\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\times10=\\boxed{\\dfrac{40}{243}}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can view flipping this coin 5 times as being equivalent to the expansion of $(h+t)^5$ where $h=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $t=\\frac{1}{3}$. The value of the $h^nt^{5-n}$ term in this expansion will be the probability of getting exactly $n$ heads, so setting $n=2$ and applying the binomial theorem gives us $p=\\dbinom{5}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3=\\boxed{\\dfrac{40}{243}}$, which is the same answer we got using the other method.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Identify the type of probability distribution.\nThis is a binomial distribution problem. We have a fixed number of independent trials (5 coin flips), each with a constant probability of success (getting heads, which is 2/3), and we want to find the probability of a specific number of successes (exactly 2 heads).\n\n## Step 2:  Define the parameters of the binomial distribution.\nThe probability of getting heads (success) is p = 2/3, and the probability of not getting heads (failure) is q = 1 - p = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. The number of trials (coin flips) is n = 5, and we want the probability of exactly k = 2 successes (heads).\n\n## Step 3:  Use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability.\nThe formula for the binomial probability is P(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * q^(n-k), where \"n choose k\" is the binomial coefficient calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!) and ! denotes factorial.\n\n## Step 4:  Calculate the binomial coefficient.\nThe binomial coefficient for 5 choose 2 is 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = (5*4) / (2*1) = 10.\n\n## Step 5:  Calculate the probability of exactly 2 heads.\nSubstitute the values into the binomial formula: P(X = 2) = (10) * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^(5-2) = 10 * (4/9) * (1/27).\n\n## Step 6:  Simplify the expression to find the final probability.\nP(X = 2) = 10 * (4/9) * (1/27) = 40 / 243.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{40}{243}}$"
