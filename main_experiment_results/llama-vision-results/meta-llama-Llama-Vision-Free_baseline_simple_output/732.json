    "problem": "Mike draws five cards from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that he draws a card from at least three of the four suits? Express your answer as a simplified fraction.",
    "solution": "We calculate the probability that he does not draw a card from at least three of the suits. To do this, we calculate the number of sets of 5 cards from at most two suits and divide by $\\binom{52}5$, the number of sets of 5 cards. Since there are $\\binom42=6$ choices for the two suits, and $\\binom{26}5$ ways to choose 5 cards from the 26 in those two suits, our answer would appear to be $6\\binom{26}5$. But this triple-counts the ways to choose the cards from a single suit: 5 hearts is included in 5 (hearts and spades), 5 (hearts and clubs), and 5 (hearts and diamonds). So we subtract twice the number of ways to choose cards from a single suit: $6\\binom{26}5-2\\cdot4\\binom{13}5$. We divide this by $\\binom{52}5$ to get $$\\frac{6\\cdot26\\cdot25\\cdot24\\cdot23\\cdot22-8\\cdot13\\cdot12\\cdot11\\cdot10\\cdot9}{52\\cdot51\\cdot50\\cdot49\\cdot48}=\\frac{88}{595}.$$Therefore, the probability that he draws three or four of the suits is $1-\\frac{88}{595}=\\boxed{\\frac{507}{595}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways Mike can draw five cards from a 52-card deck.\nThere are $\\binom{52}{5}=\\frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!}$ ways for Mike to draw five cards from the deck.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to draw three cards from three suits.\nThe number of ways to choose 3 cards from 3 suits is $\\binom{3}{3}=1$.\nThen, for each of the 3 suits, we choose 1 card from 13, so there are $13^3=2197$ possibilities.\nThe remaining two cards can be chosen from the last suit in $\\binom{13}{2}=\\frac{13\\cdot 12}{2}=78$ ways.\nTherefore, the total number of ways for Mike to draw three cards from three suits is $1\\cdot 2197\\cdot 78=171,066$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to draw four cards from four suits.\nThe number of ways to choose 4 cards from 4 suits is $\\binom{4}{4}=1$.\nThen, for each of the 4 suits, we choose 1 card from 13, so there are $13^4=28,561$ possibilities.\nTherefore, the total number of ways for Mike to draw four cards from four suits is $1\\cdot 28,561=28,561$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to draw five cards from four suits.\nThe number of ways to choose 5 cards from 4 suits is $\\binom{4}{4}=1$.\nThen, for each of the 4 suits, we choose 1 card from 13, so there are $13^4=28,561$ possibilities.\nTherefore, the total number of ways for Mike to draw five cards from four suits is $1\\cdot 28,561=28,561$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of drawing a card from at least three of the four suits.\nTo find the probability, add the number of ways to draw three cards from three suits, four cards from four suits, and five cards from four suits, then divide by the total number of ways to draw five cards.\nProbability = $\\frac{171,066+28,561+28,561}{\\frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!}}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the probability fraction.\nFirst, calculate the denominator: $\\binom{52}{5}=\\frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!}=2,598,960$.\nThen, add the numerators: $171,066+28,561+28,561=228,188$.\nThe simplified probability is $\\frac{228,188}{2,598,960}=\\frac{57197}{649740}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction.\nDivide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, 1.\n\n## Step 8: Reduce the fraction to its simplest form.\n$\\frac{57197}{649740}$ is already in its simplest form.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{57197}{649740}}$"
