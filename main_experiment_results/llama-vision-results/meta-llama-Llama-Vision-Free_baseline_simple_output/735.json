    "problem": "Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card is a $\\heartsuit$ and the second card is a $\\clubsuit$?",
    "solution": "The probability that the first card is a $\\heartsuit$ is $\\dfrac14$. The second card then has a probability of $\\dfrac{13}{51}$ of being $\\clubsuit$.  So the answer is $\\dfrac14 \\times \\dfrac{13}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{204}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, let's break down the problem into two parts: the probability of drawing a $\\heartsuit$ as the first card and then drawing a $\\clubsuit$ as the second card.\n## Step 2:  There are 52 cards in total in a standard deck, with 13 cards of each suit, including hearts and clubs.\n## Step 3:  The probability of drawing a $\\heartsuit$ as the first card is $\\frac{13}{52}$ since there are 13 hearts in the deck and a total of 52 cards.\n## Step 4:  After drawing a $\\heartsuit$, there are 51 cards left in the deck because one card has been removed.\n## Step 5:  Among these 51 cards, there are 13 $\\clubsuit$ cards, so the probability of drawing a $\\clubsuit$ as the second card is $\\frac{13}{51}$.\n## Step 6:  To find the probability of both events happening together (drawing a $\\heartsuit$ followed by a $\\clubsuit$), we multiply the probabilities of each event.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the probability of drawing a $\\heartsuit$ followed by a $\\clubsuit$ is $\\frac{13}{52} \\times \\frac{13}{51}$.\n## Step 8:  This gives us the final probability of $\\frac{13}{52} \\times \\frac{13}{51} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{13}{51}$.\n## Step 9:  Simplifying this, we get $\\frac{13}{204}$.\n## Step 10:  So, the probability that the first card is a $\\heartsuit$ and the second card is a $\\clubsuit$ is $\\frac{13}{204}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{13}{204}}$"
