    "problem": "How many license plates can be formed if every license plate has 2 different letters (A through Z) followed by 2 different one digit (0-9) numbers?",
    "solution": "The first letter can be any of the 26 letters of the alphabet, while the second letter can be any of the 25 remaining letters. The first digit can be any of the 10 digits, while the second digit can be any of the 9 remaining digits. The number of license plates is $26\\times 25\\times 10\\times 9=\\boxed{58,500}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of choices for the first letter\nThere are 26 choices for the first letter.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of choices for the second letter\nSince the second letter must be different from the first letter, there are 25 choices for the second letter.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of choices for the first digit\nThere are 10 choices for the first digit.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of choices for the second digit\nSince the second digit must be different from the first digit, there are 9 choices for the second digit.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of possible license plates\nTo find the total number of possible license plates, we multiply the number of choices for each position together: 26 * 25 * 10 * 9.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of possible license plates\n26 * 25 = 650, 650 * 10 = 6500, 6500 * 9 = 58500.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{58500}$"
