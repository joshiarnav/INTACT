    "problem": "A solid 6-by-6-by-6 cube is constructed from unit cubes and the entire outer surface is painted. What fraction of the unit cubes has at least two painted faces? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The corner cubes and edge cubes are the only ones with at least two painted faces. There are $4\\cdot12=48$ edge cubes and $8$ corner cubes, for a total of $56$ out of $6^3$. The fraction is  \\[\n\\frac{56}{6^3}=\\frac{7\\cdot2^3}{3^3\\cdot2^3}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{27}}.\n\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are given a 6-by-6-by-6 cube made from unit cubes, and we need to determine the fraction of the unit cubes that have at least two painted faces.\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we need to consider the different configurations of the unit cubes with respect to the painted faces.\n## Step 3:  First, let's consider the cubes that have three painted faces. These are the cubes on the corners of the large cube, and there are $8$ such cubes.\n## Step 4:  Next, let's consider the cubes that have two painted faces. These are the cubes on the edges of the large cube but not on the corners. There are $12$ edges on a cube, and each edge has $2$ such cubes, yielding a total of $12 \\times 2 = 24$ cubes with two painted faces.\n## Step 5:  Then, we consider the cubes that have one painted face. These are the cubes on the faces of the large cube but not on the edges. Each face has $4$ such cubes, and there are $6$ faces, giving us a total of $6 \\times 4 = 24$ cubes with one painted face.\n## Step 6:  Finally, there are the cubes with no painted faces, which are the cubes inside the large cube and not on the surface. This gives us a total of $6 \\times 6 \\times 6 - 24 - 24 - 8 = 172$ cubes with no painted faces.\n## Step 7:  Now, we can calculate the fraction of the unit cubes with at least two painted faces by adding the number of cubes with two painted faces and the number of cubes with three painted faces, and then dividing by the total number of unit cubes.\n## Step 8:  The fraction of the unit cubes with at least two painted faces is $\\frac{24+8}{6^3} = \\frac{32}{216} = \\frac{8}{54} = \\frac{4}{27}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{27}}$"
