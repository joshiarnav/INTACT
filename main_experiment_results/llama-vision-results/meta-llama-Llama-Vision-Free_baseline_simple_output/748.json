    "problem": "I have 7 books I want to arrange on a shelf. Two of them are math books, and one is a physics book. How many ways are there for me to arrange the books if I want to put the math books next to each other, and put both of them to the left of the physics book? (Note that all the books are distinguishable.)",
    "solution": "We can arrange the books on the shelf, pretending that the two math books are actually one book because they must be next to each other. In exactly half of these arrangements, the math books will be to the left of the physics book, giving $6!/2=360$ arrangements. However, in each of these arrangements there are two ways to arrange the math books, so the total number of arrangements is $360\\cdot2=\\boxed{720}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the constraints for arranging the books.\nWe have 7 distinguishable books in total. Two of these are math books, and one is a physics book. The constraint is that the two math books must be placed next to each other, and both must be placed to the left of the physics book.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the math books as a single entity for the initial arrangement.\nSince the two math books must be next to each other, we can initially treat them as a single entity, giving us 6 entities in total to arrange on the shelf (the math books as one entity, the physics book, and the 5 remaining distinguishable books).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the entities.\nThere are 6 entities in total to arrange: 1 entity (the math books together), 1 physics book, and 5 distinguishable books. The number of ways to arrange these entities is 6!.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the math books within their entity.\nSince the two math books are distinguishable, there are 2! ways to arrange them within their entity.\n\n## Step 5: Combine the arrangements of entities and math books to get the total number of arrangements.\nTo find the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the entities (Step 3) by the number of ways to arrange the math books within their entity (Step 4). This gives us 6! * 2!.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the value of 6! * 2!.\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720, and 2! = 2 * 1 = 2. Multiplying these together gives 720 * 2 = 1440.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1440}$"
