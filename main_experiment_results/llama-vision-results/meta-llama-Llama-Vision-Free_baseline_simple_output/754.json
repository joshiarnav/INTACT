    "problem": "A bin has 5 white balls and $k$ black balls in it, where $k$ is an unknown positive integer.  A ball is drawn at random from the bin.  If a white ball is drawn, the player wins 1 dollar, but if a black ball is drawn, the player loses 1 dollar.  If the expected $\\textit{loss}$ for playing the game is 50 cents, then what is $k$?",
    "solution": "There are 5 white balls and $5+k$ total balls, so the probability that a white ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{5}{5+k}$.  Similarly, the probability that a black ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{k}{5+k}$.  So  \\[ E = \\frac{5}{5+k}(1) + \\frac{k}{5+k}(-1) = -\\frac{1}{2}. \\] Multiply both sides of the equation by $2(5+k)$ to get $10 - 2k = -5 -k$, and we see that $\\boxed{k = 15}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the expected loss for playing the game\nThe expected loss for playing the game is the sum of the products of the probability of each outcome and its loss. In this case, there are two outcomes: drawing a white ball or drawing a black ball.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing a white ball\nThe probability of drawing a white ball is the number of white balls divided by the total number of balls, which is $\\frac{5}{5 + k}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of drawing a black ball\nThe probability of drawing a black ball is the number of black balls divided by the total number of balls, which is $\\frac{k}{5 + k}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the expected loss\nThe expected loss is the sum of the products of the probability of each outcome and its loss, which is:\n$\\left(\\frac{5}{5 + k}\\right)(-1) + \\left(\\frac{k}{5 + k}\\right)(1)$.\n\n## Step 5: Set up an equation using the given information\nThe expected loss for playing the game is 50 cents, so we can set up the equation:\n$\\left(\\frac{5}{5 + k}\\right)(-1) + \\left(\\frac{k}{5 + k}\\right)(1) = -0.50$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $k$\nWe can now simplify and solve for $k$:\n$\\frac{-5 + k}{5 + k} = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\nCross-multiplying and simplifying, we get:\n$-10 + 2k = -k$.\nAdding $10$ to both sides, we get:\n$2k = 10 + k$.\nSubtracting $k$ from both sides, we get:\n$k = 10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
