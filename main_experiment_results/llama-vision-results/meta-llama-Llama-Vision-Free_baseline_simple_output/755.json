    "problem": "Two different numbers are randomly selected from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and they are multiplied. What is the probability that the product is even? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The product of two integers is even unless both of the integers are odd.  Therefore, the only pair of integers from the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ whose product is odd is $\\{1,3\\}$.  Since there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs, the probability of drawing $\\{1,3\\}$ is $\\frac{1}{6}$.  So the probability of drawing two numbers whose product is even is $1-\\dfrac{1}{6}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{6}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes when two numbers are selected from the set.\nThere are 4 numbers in the set, and when two numbers are selected, the total number of outcomes is given by the combination formula $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items and $k$ is the number of items to choose. In this case, $n=4$ and $k=2$, so the total number of outcomes is $C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\cdot 2} = 6$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the pairs of numbers whose product is even.\nA product of two numbers is even if at least one of the numbers is even. The even numbers in the set are 2 and 4. The pairs of numbers that include at least one even number are (1,2), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), and (4,4). However, we are given that the two numbers are chosen without replacement and are different, so (4,4) is not a valid outcome. Therefore, the valid pairs are (1,2), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), and (3,4).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability that the product of the two selected numbers is even.\nThe probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. In this case, there are 5 favorable outcomes (the pairs (1,2), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), and (3,4)) and 6 total outcomes. So, the probability that the product is even is $\\frac{5}{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{6}}$"
