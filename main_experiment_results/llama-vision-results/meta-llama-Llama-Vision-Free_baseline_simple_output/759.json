    "problem": "Nick, Janet, Huiju, and Amanda go to the World's Largest Brat Fest. Each of them is equally likely to order a meat brat, a hot dog, or a veggie brat. What is the probability that 2 of them order a meat brat, and the other two order hot dogs?",
    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability that a person will order a meat brat, a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability that they will order a hot dog, and a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability that they will order a veggie brat. We can choose which two people we want to order meat brats in $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways, and then we want the other two to order hot dogs. Once we've set who we want to order what, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) ^4=\\frac{1}{81}$ probability that they all actually order what we want them to. Therefore, the probability that two people order meat brats and the other two hot dogs is $6\\cdot \\frac{1}{81}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{27}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes for each person.\nEach person has 3 options: a meat brat, a hot dog, or a veggie brat. Therefore, there are $3^4$ total possible outcomes for the group.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways 2 people can order a meat brat and the other 2 order hot dogs.\nTo find the number of ways 2 people can order a meat brat and the other 2 order hot dogs, we need to calculate the combinations of choosing 2 out of the 4 people to order meat brats, and the remaining 2 will order hot dogs. The number of ways to choose 2 people out of 4 is given by the combination formula $C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of the desired outcome.\nThe probability of each person ordering a meat brat or a hot dog is $\\frac{1}{3}$, and since the choices are independent, the probability that 2 people order a meat brat and the other 2 order hot dogs is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^4$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final probability.\nWe now multiply the number of ways to choose the 2 people who order meat brats (from step 2) by the probability of the desired outcome (from step 3) to find the final probability. Therefore, the final probability is $6 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^4 = 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{81} = \\frac{6}{81}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the final probability.\nThe final probability of $\\frac{6}{81}$ can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. Doing so yields $\\frac{2}{27}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{27}}$"
