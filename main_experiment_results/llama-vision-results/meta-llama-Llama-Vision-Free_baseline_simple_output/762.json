    "problem": "Three points are chosen randomly and independently on a circle. What is the probability that all three pairwise distances between the points are less than the radius of the circle?",
    "solution": "We can assume that the circle has its center at $(0,0)$ and a radius of $1$. Call the three points $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $a$, $b$, and $c$ denote the length of the counterclockwise arc from $(1,0)$ to $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively. Rotating the circle if necessary, we can also assume that $a= \\pi/3$. Since $b$ and $c$ are chosen at random from $[0, 2\\pi)$, the ordered pair $(b,c)$ is chosen at random from a square with area $4\\pi^2$ in the $bc$-plane. The condition of the problem is met if and only if \\[\n0<b<\\frac{2\\pi}{3}, \\quad 0<c<\\frac{2\\pi}{3},\n\\quad\\text{and}\\quad |b-c|<\\frac{\\pi}{3}.\n\\]This last inequality is equivalent to $b-\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}<c<b+\\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\n[asy]\nfill((0,0)--(0.33,0)--(0.66,0.33)--(0.66,0.66)--(0.33,0.66)--(0,0.33)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2)--cycle,dashed);\ndraw((0,-0.33)--(1,0.66),dashed);\ndraw((-0.33,0)--(0.66,1),dashed);\ndraw((0.66,0)--(0.66,0.66)--(0,0.66),dashed);\ndraw((-0.5,0)--(2.5,0),Arrow);\ndraw((0,-0.5)--(0,2.5),Arrow);\nlabel(\"$c$\",(0,2.5),W);\nlabel(\"$b$\",(2.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"$\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$\",(0.66,0),S);\nlabel(\"$\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$\",(0,0.66),W);\nlabel(\"$2\\pi$\",(2,0),S);\nlabel(\"$2\\pi$\",(0,2),W);\n[/asy]\n\nThe graph of the common solution to these inequalities is the shaded region shown. The area of this region is \\[\n\\left(\\frac{6}{8}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)^2 =\n\\pi^2/3,\n\\]so the requested probability is \\[\n\\frac{\\pi^2/3}{4\\pi^2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}.\n\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To calculate the probability that all three pairwise distances between the points are less than the radius of the circle, we first consider the total number of ways the points can be placed on the circle.\n## Step 2:  We start by labeling the points $A,$ $B,$ and $C$ in order as they are chosen, and we denote the center of the circle as $O$.\n## Step 3:  Since the radius of the circle is fixed, we can focus on the angles formed by the points as they are placed.\n## Step 4:  This effectively reduces the problem to the placement of the points relative to a fixed starting point $A$.\n## Step 5:  We then consider the positions of points $B$ and $C$ relative to $A$ and the circle's center $O$.\n## Step 6:  The angle formed by the points $B$ and $C$ with the center $O$ can be represented as $\\theta = \\angle AOB = \\angle AOC = \\angle BOC.$\n## Step 7:  We are interested in the probability that the distance between the points is less than the radius of the circle, which translates to the condition that $\\theta > \\frac{\\pi}{3}.$\n## Step 8:  To determine this probability, we can use geometric probability, by considering the area of the sector that satisfies the condition $\\theta > \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and comparing it to the total area of the circle.\n## Step 9:  The condition $\\theta > \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ defines a sector in the circle, and we need to calculate the area of this sector.\n## Step 10:  The area of the sector can be calculated using the formula for the area of a sector of a circle, which is given by $A = \\frac{\\theta}{2\\pi} \\cdot \\pi r^2 = \\frac{\\theta}{2} r^2.$\n## Step 11:  We then need to compare this area to the total area of the circle, which is $A_{\\text{total}} = \\pi r^2.$\n## Step 12:  The probability we are looking for is the ratio of the area of the sector to the total area of the circle, which is given by $\\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}{2\\pi}.$\n## Step 13:  Simplifying this ratio gives us the final probability that all three pairwise distances between the points are less than the radius of the circle.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$"
