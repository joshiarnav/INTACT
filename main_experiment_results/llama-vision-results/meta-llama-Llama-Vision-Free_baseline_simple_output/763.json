    "problem": "A singles tournament had six players. Each player played every other player only once, with no ties. If Helen won 4 games, Ines won 3 games, Janet won 2 games, Kendra won 2 games and Lara won 2 games, how many games did Monica win?",
    "solution": "Each of the six players played 5 games, and each game involved two players. So there were $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ games. Helen, Ines, Janet, Kendra and Lara won a total of $4+3+2+2+2=13$ games, so Monica won $15-13=\\boxed{2}$ games.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of games played in the tournament.\nIn a tournament where each player plays every other player once, the total number of games can be calculated using the formula n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of players. So, with 6 players, the total number of games is 6(6-1)/2 = 15.\n\n## Step 2: Sum up the number of games won by Helen, Ines, Janet, Kendra, and Lara.\nHelen won 4 games, Ines won 3 games, Janet won 2 games, Kendra won 2 games, and Lara won 2 games. So, the total number of games won by these 5 players is 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 13.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of games Monica won.\nSince the total number of games played in the tournament is 15 and the 5 players (Helen, Ines, Janet, Kendra, and Lara) won a total of 13 games, Monica must have won the remaining games. Therefore, Monica won 15 - 13 = 2 games.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
