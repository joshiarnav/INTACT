    "problem": "There are 360 people in my school.  15 take calculus, physics, and chemistry, and 15 don't take any of them.  180 take calculus.  Twice as many students take chemistry as take physics.  75 take both calculus and chemistry, and 75 take both physics and chemistry.  Only 30 take both physics and calculus.  How many students take physics?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of students taking physics, so the number in chemistry is $2x$.  There are 15 students taking all three, and 30 students in both physics and calculus, meaning there are $30 - 15 = 15$ students in just physics and calculus.  Similarly there are $60$ students in just chemistry and calculus, and $60$ in physics and chemistry.  Since there are $x$ students in physics and $15 + 15 + 60 = 90$ students taking physics along with other classes, $x - 90$ students are just taking physics.  Similarly, there are $2x - 135$ students taking just chemistry and $90$ students taking just calculus.  Knowing that there are 15 students not taking any of them, the sum of these eight categories is 360, the total number of people at the school:   \\[\n(x - 90) + (2x - 135) + 90 + 60 + 15 + 60 + 15 + 15 = 360.\n\\] We solve for $x$ and find that the number of physics students is $x = \\boxed{110}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Let's denote the number of students taking calculus as C, the number of students taking physics as P, and the number of students taking chemistry as K.\n## Step 2:  Given that 180 students take calculus, we have C = 180.\n## Step 3:  We also know that 15 students take all three subjects, and 75 students take both calculus and chemistry, and 75 take both physics and chemistry.\n## Step 4:  Furthermore, 30 students take both physics and calculus.\n## Step 5:  Also, we are told that 15 students don't take any of the subjects.\n## Step 6:  Since twice as many students take chemistry as take physics, we can write K = 2P.\n## Step 7:  We know that 360 students are in the school, so 360 - 15 - 15 = 330 students take at least one of the subjects.\n## Step 8:  We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate the total number of students who take at least one subject.\n## Step 9:  The formula for this principle is Total = C + P + K - C \u2229 P - C \u2229 K - P \u2229 K + C \u2229 P \u2229 K.\n## Step 10:  We have C = 180, C \u2229 P = 30, C \u2229 K = 75, P \u2229 K = 75, and C \u2229 P \u2229 K = 15.\n## Step 11:  Substituting these values into the formula, we get 330 = 180 + P + 2P - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15.\n## Step 12:  Simplifying this equation, we get 330 = 180 + 3P - 75 - 75 + 15.\n## Step 13:  Further simplifying, we get 330 = 180 + 3P - 135.\n## Step 14:  Simplifying again, we get 330 = 45 + 3P.\n## Step 15:  Now, solving for P, we get 3P = 330 - 45 = 285.\n## Step 16:  Finally, we get P = 285/3 = 95.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{95}$"
