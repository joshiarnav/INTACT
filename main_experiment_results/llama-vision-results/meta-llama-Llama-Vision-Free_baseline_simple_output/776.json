    "problem": "The planning committee at school has 11 members. Exactly five of these members are teachers. A four-person subcommittee with at least one member who is not a teacher must be formed from the members of the planning committee. How many distinct subcommittees are possible?",
    "solution": "Because there are 5 teachers on the committee, there are 6 non-teachers. Now, in total, we can form ${11 \\choose 4} = 330$ subcomittees. The number of subcommittees with zero non-teachers is the number of subcommittees formed by the 5 teachers, totaling ${5 \\choose 4} = 5$. So, the number of subcomittees with at least one non-teacher is $330 - 5 = \\boxed{325}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of teachers and non-teachers in the planning committee.\nThere are 5 teachers and 6 non-teachers in the planning committee.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose a subcommittee with at least one non-teacher.\nTo do this, we will calculate the total number of subcommittees that can be formed and subtract the number of subcommittees that consist entirely of teachers.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of subcommittees that can be formed.\nWe can choose 4 people out of 11, so the total number of subcommittees is $\\binom{11}{4} = \\frac{11!}{(4!)(7!)} = 330$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of subcommittees that consist entirely of teachers.\nWe can choose 4 people out of the 5 teachers, so the number of subcommittees that consist entirely of teachers is $\\binom{5}{4} = \\frac{5!}{(4!)(1!)} = 5$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of subcommittees with at least one non-teacher.\nThis is the total number of subcommittees minus the number of subcommittees with only teachers. Therefore, the number of subcommittees with at least one non-teacher is $330 - 5 = 325$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{325}$"
