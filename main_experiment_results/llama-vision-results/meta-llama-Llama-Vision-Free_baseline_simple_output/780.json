    "problem": "A bag has 4 red and 6 blue marbles.  A marble is selected and not replaced, then a second is selected.  What is the probability that both are the same color?",
    "solution": "The probability that both marbles are red is given by: $$ P(\\text{both red}) = P(\\text{1st red}) \\times P(\\text{2nd red \\textbf{after} 1st red is drawn}). $$The probability that the first marble is red is $\\frac{4}{10}$.  After drawing a red marble, there are 3 red marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also red is $\\frac{3}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{4}{10}\\times \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{2}{15}. $$Similarly, the probability that both marbles are blue is given by: $$ P(\\text{both blue}) = P(\\text{1st blue}) \\times P(\\text{2nd blue \\textbf{after} 1st blue drawn}). $$The probability that that the first marble is blue is $\\frac{6}{10}$.  After drawing a blue marble, there are 5 blue marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also blue is $\\frac{5}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\\text{both blue}) = \\frac{6}{10}\\times \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}. $$Since drawing two red marbles and drawing two blue marbles are exclusive events, we add the individual probabilities to get the probability of one or the other occurring.  Therefore: \\begin{align*}P(\\text{both same color}) &= P(\\text{both red}) + P(\\text{both blue}) \\\\ &= \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\boxed{ \\frac{7}{15}}. \\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing two red marbles\nThere are 4 red marbles out of a total of 10 marbles.  The probability of drawing a red marble first is 4/10 = 2/5.  After removing one red marble, there are 3 red marbles left out of 9. The probability of drawing a second red marble is 3/9 = 1/3.  The probability of drawing two red marbles is the product of these probabilities: (2/5)(1/3) = 2/15.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing two blue marbles\nThere are 6 blue marbles out of a total of 10 marbles.  The probability of drawing a blue marble first is 6/10 = 3/5.  After removing one blue marble, there are 5 blue marbles left out of 9. The probability of drawing a second blue marble is 5/9.  The probability of drawing two blue marbles is the product of these probabilities: (3/5)(5/9) = 1/3.\n\n## Step 3: Add the probabilities of drawing two red marbles and two blue marbles\nTo find the total probability of drawing two marbles of the same color, we need to add the probabilities of drawing two red marbles and two blue marbles: 2/15 + 1/3 = 2/15 + 5/15 = 7/15.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{15}}$"
