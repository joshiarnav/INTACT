    "problem": "How many nine-digit numbers can be made using each of the digits 1 through 9 exactly once with the digits alternating between odd and even?",
    "solution": "There are five odd digits and four even digits to be used. Because the digits must alternate between odd and even, this means that there is only one possible way to distribute odds (O) and evens (E): OEOEOEOEO. Now, there are $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2 = 120$ ways to arrange the odd numbers, as there are five choices for the first slot, four for the second, and so on. Similarly, there are $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$ ways to arrange the even numbers. Our final answer is the product of $120$ and $24$, which is $\\boxed{2880}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the odd and even digits within the range of 1 through 9.\nThe odd digits are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, while the even digits are 2, 4, 6, and 8.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of odd and even digits available for the nine-digit number.\nThere are 5 odd digits and 4 even digits available.\n\n## Step 3: Recognize that the digits must alternate between odd and even in the nine-digit number.\nThis means that the first digit must be odd, followed by an even digit, then another odd digit, and so on, until the last digit.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the odd and even digits according to the given pattern.\nThere are 5 odd digits, so they can be arranged in 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 ways. Similarly, there are 4 even digits that can be arranged in 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 ways.\n\n## Step 5: Combine the arrangements of odd and even digits to find the total number of possible nine-digit numbers.\nThe total number of arrangements is the product of the number of ways to arrange the odd digits and the number of ways to arrange the even digits: 120 * 24 = 2880.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the alternating pattern constraint.\nSince the digits must alternate between odd and even, the arrangement of odd and even digits is fixed once the odd digits are chosen. Therefore, the calculation in step 5 already accounts for the alternating pattern constraint.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2880}$"
