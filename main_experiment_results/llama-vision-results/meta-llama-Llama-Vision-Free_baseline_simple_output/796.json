    "problem": "In how many ways can we seat 8 people around a table if Alice and Bob won't sit next to each other?  (Two seatings are the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "There are 8 choices for seats for Alice to sit in.  Once Alice is seated, there are 5 seats left for Bob, since he won't sit in either seat immediately next to Alice.  This leaves 6 people to place in the remaining 6 seats, which can be done in $6!$ ways.  However, we must divide by 8 to account for the 8 rotations of the table.  So the number of arrangements is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 5 \\times 6!}{8} = 5 \\times 6! = \\boxed{3600}$. Alternatively, we can account for the rotations at the beginning, by fixing the table around Alice.  Bob can't sit in her seat, or the two seats next to her.  This leaves 5 places for him to sit.  Then, this leaves 6 unique seats for the 6 remaining people, so there are 6! ways to sit them after Bob is sitting.  So the answer is $5 \\times 6! = \\boxed{3600}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We have 8 people who need to be seated around a table, and there's a restriction that Alice and Bob cannot sit next to each other.\n## Step 2:  To start solving this problem, let's consider the total number of ways to seat 8 people around a table without any restrictions.\n## Step 3:  Since the table is circular, we can fix one person's position as a reference point, and arrange the remaining 7 people around the table.\n## Step 4:  There are $7!$ ways to arrange the remaining 7 people once the reference person is fixed.\n## Step 5:  However, we need to account for the fact that the table is circular, so if we rotate the seating arrangement, it should be considered the same.\n## Step 6:  This means we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of possible rotations, which is 8.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the total number of possible seating arrangements without any restrictions is $\\dfrac{7!}{8}$.\n## Step 8:  Now, we need to find the number of arrangements where Alice and Bob do sit next to each other, and then subtract this from the total number of arrangements to get our final answer.\n## Step 9:  If Alice and Bob sit together, we can consider them as a single entity, so we effectively have 7 entities (the single Alice-Bob entity and the 6 other people) to arrange around the table.\n## Step 10:  There are $6!$ ways to arrange these 7 entities around the table.\n## Step 11:  However, within the Alice-Bob entity, Alice and Bob can be seated in 2 different orders (Alice to the left of Bob or Bob to the left of Alice).\n## Step 12:  Therefore, the total number of arrangements where Alice and Bob sit next to each other is $2 \\times 6!$.\n## Step 13:  To find the number of arrangements where Alice and Bob do not sit next to each other, we subtract the number of arrangements where they do sit next to each other from the total number of arrangements.\n## Step 14:  This gives us $\\dfrac{7!}{8} - 2 \\times 6!$.\n## Step 15:  Now, let's simplify the expression to get the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{34650}$"
