    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the number of diagonals in the fifth polygon, we need to use the formula for calculating the number of diagonals in an n-gon, which is $n(n-3)/2$.\n## Step 2:  First, we need to determine the value of n for the fifth polygon. Looking at the sequence given, it seems that the number of sides of each polygon is increasing by 3, starting from 3. Therefore, the number of sides of the fifth polygon would be 3 + (5-1)*3 = 15.\n## Step 3:  Now that we have the value of n, we can use the formula $n(n-3)/2$ to calculate the number of diagonals in the fifth polygon. Substituting n = 15 into the formula, we get $\\frac{15(15-3)}{2} = \\frac{15 \\times 12}{2} = \\frac{180}{2} = 90$.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, the fifth polygon has $\\boxed{90}$ diagonals.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{90}$"
