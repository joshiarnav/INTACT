    "problem": "A player chooses one of the numbers 1 through 4. After the choice has been made, two regular four-sided (tetrahedral) dice are rolled, with the sides of the dice numbered 1 through 4. If the number chosen appears on the bottom of exactly one die after it is rolled, then the player wins $\\$1.$ If the number chosen appears on the bottom of both of the dice, then the player wins $\\$2.$ If the number chosen does not appear on the bottom of either of the dice, the player loses $\\$1.$ What is the expected return to the player, in dollars, for one roll of the dice? Give your answer as a fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability of the number appearing 0, 1, and 2 times is \\begin{align*}\n&P(0) = \\frac{3}{4}\\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{9}{16},\\\\\n&P(1) = 2\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{6}{16},\n\\quad\\text{and}\\\\\n&P(2) = \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16},\n\\end{align*} respectively. So the expected return, in dollars, to the player is \\begin{align*}\nP(0)\\cdot (-1) + P(1)\\cdot (1) + P(2)\\cdot (2) &= \\frac{-9 + 6 +\n2}{16} \\\\\n&= \\boxed{-\\frac{1}{16}}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the possible outcomes for the player.\nThe player can choose one of the numbers 1 through 4, and then two dice are rolled. The player wins $1 if the chosen number appears on the bottom of exactly one die, wins $2 if it appears on the bottom of both dice, and loses $1 if it does not appear on the bottom of either die.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of each winning condition.\nThe probability of the chosen number appearing on the bottom of exactly one die can be found using the binomial coefficient. There are $\\binom{2}{1}=2$ ways to choose which die does not show the number, and for each of these choices, there are $1$ way for the die that shows the number to land on the chosen number and $3$ ways for the other die to not show the number. So, the probability of the chosen number appearing on the bottom of exactly one die is $\\frac{2\\cdot 1 \\cdot 3}{4^2} = \\frac{6}{16}.$\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of the chosen number appearing on the bottom of both dice.\nThe probability of the chosen number appearing on the bottom of both dice is $1$ divided by the total number of outcomes for the two dice, which is $4^2=16$. Therefore, the probability of the chosen number appearing on the bottom of both dice is $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of the chosen number not appearing on the bottom of either die.\nThe probability of the chosen number not appearing on the bottom of either die is $3$ divided by the total number of outcomes for the two dice, which is $4^2=16$. Therefore, the probability of the chosen number not appearing on the bottom of either die is $\\frac{3}{16}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the expected return using the probabilities of the winning conditions.\nThe expected return is the sum of the products of each outcome and its probability. In this case, the expected return is $(\\$2)\\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right)+(\\$1)\\left(\\frac{6}{16}\\right)+(-\\$1)\\left(\\frac{3}{16}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression for the expected return.\n$(\\$2)\\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right)+(\\$1)\\left(\\frac{6}{16}\\right)+(-\\$1)\\left(\\frac{3}{16}\\right) = \\$\\frac{2}{16} + \\$\\frac{6}{16} - \\$\\frac{3}{16} = \\$\\frac{5}{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$"
