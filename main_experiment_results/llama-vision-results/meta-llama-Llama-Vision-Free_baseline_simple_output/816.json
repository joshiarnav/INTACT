    "problem": "When counting from $3$ to $201$, $53$ is the $51^\\mathrm{st}$ number counted. When counting backwards from $201$ to $3$, $53$ is the $n^\\mathrm{th}$ number counted. What is $n$?",
    "solution": "Note that $n$ is equal to the number of integers between $53$ and $201$, inclusive. Thus, $n=201-53+1=\\boxed{149}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We need to determine the position of the number $53$ when counting backwards from $201$ to $3$.\n## Step 2:  When counting from $3$ to $201$, we know that $53$ is the $51^\\mathrm{st}$ number.\n## Step 3:  To find the position of $53$ when counting backwards, we first need to understand the total count of numbers from $201$ to $3$.\n## Step 4:  Since we are counting backwards, we need to find the position of $53$ in the reverse sequence.\n## Step 5:  There are $201-3+1=199$ numbers in the sequence from $3$ to $201$.\n## Step 6:  To find the position of $53$, we need to calculate how many numbers we need to go back from $53$ to reach the start of the sequence.\n## Step 7:  This can be found by subtracting the current position of $53$ from the total count, which gives us $199-51+1=149$.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, $53$ is the $149^\\mathrm{th}$ number when counting backwards from $201$ to $3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{149}$"
