    "problem": "Four-digit integers are formed using the digits 2, 3, 4 and 5. Any of the digits can be used any number of times. How many such four-digit integers are palindromes? Palindromes read the same forward and backward.",
    "solution": "If the four-digit integer is to be a palindrome, then the third digit must be the same as the second and the fourth must be the same as the first.  So, once we choose the first two digits, we can only form the palindrome in one way. There are 4 choices for the first digit and 4 choices for the second digit, so there are $4 \\times 4 = \\boxed{16}$ such integers.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define what makes a four-digit integer a palindrome.\nA four-digit integer is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward, meaning the first and fourth digits are the same, and the second and third digits are the same.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the choices for the first and second digits.\nSince any of the digits 2, 3, 4, or 5 can be used any number of times, there are 4 choices for the first digit and 4 choices for the second digit.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the constraints for the first and second digits to form a palindrome.\nFor a four-digit integer to be a palindrome, the first and fourth digits must be the same, and the second and third digits must be the same. This means the first digit can be repeated in the fourth position, and the second digit can be repeated in the third position.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the number of palindromes.\nSince there are 4 choices for the first digit and 4 choices for the second digit, and these choices determine the entire palindrome (as the first and fourth digits are the same, and the second and third digits are the same), the total number of palindromes is 4 * 4 = 16.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$"
