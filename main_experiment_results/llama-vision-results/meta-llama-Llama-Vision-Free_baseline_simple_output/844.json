    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the number of different three-step paths along the edges of a cube that take us from vertex $A$ to vertex $B$.\n## Step 2:  To start, we can consider the possible paths step by step. The first step can be taken in 3 different ways - moving right, up, or forward from vertex $A$.\n## Step 3:  Once the first step is taken, there are only 2 possible directions for the second step, as we cannot move back to the starting vertex.\n## Step 4:  After the second step, for the third step, there is only 1 possible direction to move to reach vertex $B$.\n## Step 5:  To find the total number of different paths, we need to multiply the number of choices at each step, which gives us $3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$.\n## Step 6:  However, we need to consider the different routes taken to reach vertex $B$. We can take the right path, then up, then forward, or we can take the right path, then forward, then up, or we can take the up path, then right, then forward, or we can take the up path, then forward, then right, or we can take the forward path, then right, then up, or we can take the forward path, then up, then right.\n## Step 7:  We can observe that all these paths are essentially the same path, just described in different orders. Therefore, there are only 4 distinct paths to reach vertex $B$.\n## Step 8:  We have the paths R-U-F, R-F-U, U-R-F, U-F-R, F-R-U, and F-U-R. When we compare these, we can see that R-U-F and F-U-R are the same, and R-F-U and U-F-R are the same, and U-R-F and R-U-F are the same.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, we have 4 distinct paths.\n## Step 10:  Hence, the number of different three-step paths along the edges of a cube that take us from vertex $A$ to vertex $B$ is $\\boxed{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
