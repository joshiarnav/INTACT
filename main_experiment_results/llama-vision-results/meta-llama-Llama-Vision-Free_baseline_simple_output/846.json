    "solution": "We can make a triangle out of any three vertices, so the problem is really asking how many ways there are to choose three vertices from six. There are six choices for the first vertex, five for the second, and four for the third. However, we've overcounted, so we have to determine how many different orders there are in which we could choose those same three vertices. That is, if we choose $x$ for the first vertex, $y$ for the second, and $z$ for the third, it will be the same triangle as if we had chosen $y$ for the first vertex, $z$ for the second, and $x$ for the third. We can pick any three of the vertices first, any two second, and then the last is determined, so we've overcounted by a factor of six. Thus, our final answer is $\\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4}{6} = \\boxed{20}$ triangles.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are given a hexagon and we need to find the number of different triangles that can be formed by selecting three vertices of the hexagon.\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we can start by understanding the basic properties of triangles. A triangle is formed by connecting three non-collinear points. In the context of a hexagon, these points are the vertices of the hexagon.\n## Step 3:  Considering the total number of vertices of the hexagon, we find that there are six vertices.\n## Step 4:  Now, to form a triangle, we need to choose three of these vertices. The order in which we choose these vertices does not matter, as the same triangle will be formed.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, we are dealing with combinations, where we need to choose 3 vertices out of 6. This can be calculated using the combination formula $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $r$ is the number of items to choose.\n## Step 6:  Applying the combination formula, we get $\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6\\cdot5\\cdot4}{3\\cdot2\\cdot1} = 20$.\n## Step 7:  This means that there are a total of 20 different ways to choose 3 vertices out of 6, which corresponds to the number of different triangles that can be formed.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the total number of different triangles that can be formed using three vertices of a hexagon as vertices of a triangle is $\\boxed{20}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$"
