    "problem": "During a party, a total of 78 handshakes occurred. If each person shook hands once with each of the other people, how many people were at the party?",
    "solution": "Since each person shakes hands with each other person, every pair of people will shake hands once. So, 78 represents the number of pairs, which we can count as ${n \\choose 2}$ where $n$ is the number of people at the party. So, $n(n-1) = 2 \\cdot 78 = 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 13 = 12 \\cdot 13$. So, $n=13$ gives us $\\boxed{13}$ people at the party.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the problem type\nThis is a combination problem. We are trying to find the number of people, which is the number of elements in a set and can be represented as \"n\" in the combination formula.\n\n## Step 2: Use the combination formula\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2, where C(n, 2) is the number of combinations of n items taken 2 at a time.\n\n## Step 3: Plug in the number of handshakes\nWe are given that the total number of handshakes is 78. Therefore, we can write the equation as n(n-1)/2 = 78.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for n\nWe will solve the equation n(n-1)/2 = 78 for n.\n\n## Step 5: Multiply both sides by 2\nWe will multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction. This gives us n(n-1) = 156.\n\n## Step 6: Expand the left side of the equation\nThe left side of the equation n(n-1) is equal to n^2 - n.\n\n## Step 7: Rewrite the equation\nSo, we can rewrite the equation as n^2 - n = 156.\n\n## Step 8: Rearrange the equation\nWe can rearrange the equation as n^2 - n - 156 = 0.\n\n## Step 9: Solve the quadratic equation\nWe will use the quadratic formula to solve the equation n^2 - n - 156 = 0.\n\n## Step 10: Plug in the coefficients into the quadratic formula\nThe coefficients for the quadratic equation are a = 1, b = -1, and c = -156.\n\n## Step 11: Plug the coefficients into the quadratic formula\nThe quadratic formula is n = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.\n\n## Step 12: Substitute the coefficients into the quadratic formula\nSubstituting the coefficients into the quadratic formula, we get n = (1 \u00b1 sqrt((-1)^2 - 4(1)(-156))) / (2(1)).\n\n## Step 13: Simplify the expression\nWe can simplify the expression under the square root: n = (1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 624)) / 2.\n\n## Step 14: Simplify further\nSimplifying further, we get n = (1 \u00b1 sqrt(625)) / 2.\n\n## Step 15: Solve for n\nWe get n = (1 \u00b1 25) / 2.\n\n## Step 16: Solve for n\nWe have two possible solutions: n = (1 + 25) / 2 or n = (1 - 25) / 2.\n\n## Step 17: Solve for n\nSimplifying these two possible solutions, we get n = 26 / 2 or n = -24 / 2.\n\n## Step 18: Solve for n\nSimplifying further, we get n = 13 or n = -12.\n\n## Step 19: Choose a valid solution\nSince the number of people cannot be negative, we choose the valid solution n = 13.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$"
