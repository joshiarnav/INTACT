    "problem": "John rolls a pair of standard 6-sided dice. What is the probability that the two numbers he rolls are relatively prime? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We have to use a little bit of casework to solve this problem. If the first die shows a 1, the second die can be anything (6 cases). If the first die shows 2 or 4, the second die is limited to 1, 3, or 5 ($2\\cdot3 = 6$ cases). If the first die shows 3, the second die can be 1, 2, 4, or 5 (4 cases). If the first die shows 5, the second die can be anything but 5 (5 cases). If the first die shows 6, the second die can be only 1 or 5 (2 cases). There are 36 ways to roll two dice, 23 of which are valid, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{23}{36}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To solve this problem, we need to first identify the relatively prime pairs that can be rolled with a pair of standard 6-sided dice.\nRelatively prime pairs are those pairs of numbers whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.\n\n## Step 2: We can list out all possible outcomes of rolling a pair of dice and then identify which pairs are relatively prime.\nThe possible outcomes are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\n## Step 3: We can then identify the pairs that are relatively prime.\nThe relatively prime pairs are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,3), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,5).\n\n## Step 4: Count the total number of outcomes and the number of relatively prime pairs.\nThere are 36 possible outcomes, and there are 24 relatively prime pairs.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of rolling a relatively prime pair.\nProbability is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, so the probability is 24/36, which can be simplified.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the fraction 24/36 to its simplest form.\nThe greatest common divisor of 24 and 36 is 12, so we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 12. 24/12 = 2 and 36/12 = 3, so the simplified fraction is 2/3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$"
