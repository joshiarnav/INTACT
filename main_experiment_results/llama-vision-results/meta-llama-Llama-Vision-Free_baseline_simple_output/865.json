    "problem": "Liz has 11 marbles of different colors. In how many ways can she choose 3 of the marbles, if she refuses to choose the green one and the purple one at the same time?",
    "solution": "We can divide this into cases:\n\nCase 1: Liz chooses the green marble, and not the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles (since she won't choose the purple marble). So, there are $\\binom{9}{2}=36$ choices in this case.\n\nCase 2: Liz chooses the purple marble, and not the green marble. As in Case 1, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles. So, there are $\\binom{9}{2}$ choices in this case.\n\nCase 3: Liz chooses neither the green marble nor the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose three marbles from the nine remaining marbles, and there are $\\binom{9}{3}=84$ choices in this case.\n\nThe total number of possible choices is $36+36+84=\\boxed{156}$.\n\nAlternatively, there are $\\binom{11}{3}=165$ ways to select three marbles. Of those, $\\binom{9}{1}=9$ ways contain both the purple marble and the green marble. Therefore, there are $165-9=\\boxed{156}$ ways to select three marbles such that purple and green marbles are not both chosen.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, let's determine the total number of ways Liz can choose 3 marbles out of 11 without any restrictions. This is a combination problem, where the order of selection does not matter.\n## Step 2:  The formula for combinations is given by C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 11 (total marbles) and k = 3 (marbles to choose).\n## Step 3:  Substituting these values into the combination formula, we get C(11, 3) = 11! / (3!(11-3)!) = 11! / (3!8!) = (11 * 10 * 9) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 165.\n## Step 4:  This means there are 165 ways for Liz to choose 3 marbles out of 11 without any restrictions.\n## Step 5:  Now, let's consider the condition that Liz refuses to choose the green one and the purple one at the same time. To account for this restriction, we need to subtract the number of combinations that include both the green and purple marbles.\n## Step 6:  If Liz chooses both the green and purple marbles, she has to choose 1 more marble from the remaining 9 marbles. This is a combination problem as well, with n = 9 and k = 1.\n## Step 7:  Using the combination formula, C(9, 1) = 9! / (1!(9-1)!) = 9.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, there are 9 ways for Liz to choose 3 marbles that include both the green and purple marbles.\n## Step 9:  To find the total number of ways Liz can choose 3 marbles without choosing both the green and purple ones at the same time, we subtract the number of combinations with both green and purple marbles from the total number of combinations without any restrictions.\n## Step 10:  The result of this subtraction is 165 - 9 = 156.\n## Step 11:  Thus, there are 156 ways for Liz to choose 3 marbles without choosing both the green and purple ones at the same time.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{156}$"
