    "problem": "Derek's phone number, $336$ - $7624,$ has the property that the three-digit prefix, $336,$ equals the product of the last four digits, $7 \\times 6 \\times 2 \\times 4.$ How many seven-digit phone numbers beginning with $336$ have this property?",
    "solution": "We begin by factoring $336$. $336 = 2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7.$ Because we are looking for phone numbers, we want four single digits that will multiply to equal $336.$ Notice that $7$ cannot be multiplied by anything, because $7 \\cdot 2$ is $14,$ which is already two digits. So, one of our digits is necessarily $7.$  The factor $3$ can be multiplied by at most $2,$ and the highest power of $2$ that we can have is $2^3 = 8.$ Using these observations, it is fairly simple to come up with the following list of groups of digits whose product is $336:$ \\begin{align*}\n&1, 6, 7, 8\\\\\n&2, 4, 6, 7\\\\\n&2, 3, 7, 8 \\\\\n&3, 4, 4, 7\n\\end{align*}For the first three groups, there are $4! = 24$ possible rearrangements of the digits. For the last group, $4$ is repeated twice, so we must divide by $2$ to avoid overcounting, so there are $\\frac{4!}{2} = 12$ possible rearrangements of the digits. Thus, there are $3 \\cdot 24 + 12 = \\boxed{84}$ possible phone numbers that can be constructed to have this property.",

This can be represented as $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways to arrange the $2$'s, and then the remaining positions must be filled with the remaining factors.\n## Step 9:  There is only 1 way to arrange the $3$ and the $7,$ so the total number of combinations is the product of these possibilities, which is $4$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, there are $4$ possible combinations of the last four digits that can multiply to $336.$\n## Step 11:  Now, we can calculate the total number of seven-digit phone numbers beginning with $336$ that have this property.\n## Step 12:  The total number of such phone numbers is the product of the possibilities for the first three digits and the $4$ possible combinations of the last four digits that multiply to $336.$\n## Step 13:  Therefore, the total number of such phone numbers is $4 \\times 4 = 16.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$"
