    "problem": "Max has a spinner that lands on 1 with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$, lands on 2 with a probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$, lands on 3 with a probability of $\\frac{1}{6}$, and lands on 4 with a probability of $\\frac{1}{12}$. If Max spins the spinner, and then Zack spins the spinner, then what is the probability that Max gets a larger number than Zack does?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the probability we are looking for and $y$ be the probability that they both spin the same number. By symmetry, it's clear that the probability of Zack getting a larger number than Max does is also equal to $x$. Furthermore, all possible outcomes can be divided into three categories: Max gets a larger number than Zack does, Max and Zack get the same number, or Zack gets a larger number than Max. The sum of the probabilities of these three events is 1, which gives us the equation $x+y+x=1$.\n\nWe can calculate $y$ with a little bit of casework. There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's. The probability of getting a 1 is $\\dfrac{1}{2}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 1 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{4}$. Similarly, the probability of getting a 2 is $\\dfrac{1}{4}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 2 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{16}$. The probability of getting a 3 is $\\dfrac{1}{6}$, so the probability that they will both get a 3 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{36}$ and the probability that they will both get a 4 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{12}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{144}$. This gives us  $$y=\\dfrac{1}{4}+\\dfrac{1}{16}+\\dfrac{1}{36}+\\dfrac{1}{144}=\\dfrac{25}{72}.$$Substituting this into $2x+y=1$ gives us $2x=\\dfrac{47}{72}$, so $x=\\boxed{\\dfrac{47}{144}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the possible outcomes for Max and Zack\nMax can land on 1, 2, 3, or 4 with probabilities of $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, and $\\frac{1}{12}$ respectively. The same probabilities apply to Zack.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the cases where Max gets a larger number than Zack\nWe need to consider the cases where Max's number is larger than Zack's. This can occur when Max spins a 2 and Zack spins a 1, when Max spins a 3 and Zack spins a 1 or 2, when Max spins a 4 and Zack spins a 1, 2, or 3.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of Max getting a 2 and Zack getting a 1\nThe probability of Max getting a 2 is $\\frac{1}{4}$, and the probability of Zack getting a 1 is $\\frac{1}{2}$. So the combined probability is $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of Max getting a 3 and Zack getting a 1\nThe probability of Max getting a 3 is $\\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability of Zack getting a 1 is $\\frac{1}{2}$. So the combined probability is $\\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of Max getting a 3 and Zack getting a 2\nThe probability of Max getting a 3 is $\\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability of Zack getting a 2 is $\\frac{1}{4}$. So the combined probability is $\\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{24}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of Max getting a 4 and Zack getting a 1\nThe probability of Max getting a 4 is $\\frac{1}{12}$, and the probability of Zack getting a 1 is $\\frac{1}{2}$. So the combined probability is $\\frac{1}{12} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{24}$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability of Max getting a 4 and Zack getting a 2\nThe probability of Max getting a 4 is $\\frac{1}{12}$, and the probability of Zack getting a 2 is $\\frac{1}{4}$. So the combined probability is $\\frac{1}{12} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{48}$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the probability of Max getting a 4 and Zack getting a 3\nThe probability of Max getting a 4 is $\\frac{1}{12}$, and the probability of Zack getting a 3 is $\\frac{1}{6}$. So the combined probability is $\\frac{1}{12} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{72}$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the total probability of Max getting a larger number than Zack\nWe need to add the probabilities of all the cases calculated in the previous steps. The total probability is $\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{24} + \\frac{1}{24} + \\frac{1}{48} + \\frac{1}{72}$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the sum of the fractions\nTo add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 is 144. We can rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 144:\n\n$\\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{18}{144}$,\n$\\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{12}{144}$,\n$\\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{6}{144}$,\n$\\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{6}{144}$,\n$\\frac{1}{48} = \\frac{3}{144}$,\n$\\frac{1}{72} = \\frac{2}{144}$.\n\n## Step 11: Add the fractions\nNow we can add the fractions:\n$\\frac{18}{144} + \\frac{12}{144} + \\frac{6}{144} + \\frac{6}{144} + \\frac{3}{144} + \\frac{2}{144} = \\frac{47}{144}$.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the fraction (if necessary)\nThe fraction $\\frac{47}{144}$ cannot be simplified further.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{47}{144}}$"
