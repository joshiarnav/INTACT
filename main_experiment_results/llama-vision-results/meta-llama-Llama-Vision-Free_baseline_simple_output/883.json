    "problem": "Suelyn counts up from 1 to 9, and then immediately counts down again to 1, and then back up to 9, and so on, alternately counting up and down $$(1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,\\ldots ).$$ What is the $1000^{\\text{th}}$ integer in her list?",
    "solution": "We can treat this list as a sequence with a repetitive pattern. We see the sequence repeats itself every 16 elements (from 1 to 9 then back to 2). Because 1000 divided by 16 is 62 with a remainder of 8, to get 1000 terms in this list, we repeat the block 62 times, and then go 8 more elements.  This means that the $1000^{\\text{th}}$ integer is the same as the $8^{\\text{th}}$ integer, which is $\\boxed{8}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the pattern of Suelyn's counting\nSuelyn is alternately counting up and down from 1 to 9. When she counts up, she starts at 1 and goes up to 9, and when she counts down, she starts at 9 and goes down to 1.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of elements in one full cycle of counting up and down\nSince Suelyn counts up from 1 to 9 and then counts down from 9 to 1, there are 18 elements in one full cycle of counting (9 up and 9 down).\n\n## Step 3: Find out how many full cycles there are before reaching the 1000th integer\nSince each full cycle has 18 elements, we divide 1000 by 18 to find out how many full cycles there are before reaching the 1000th integer. This will give us the number of times Suelyn has completed the cycle of counting up and down.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the remainder after subtracting the full cycles\nWe will subtract the product of the quotient from the number of elements in one full cycle from the 1000th position to find the position of the 1000th integer. This will give us the position within the cycle that we are interested in.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the value of the 1000th integer\nSince each cycle consists of 18 elements, we can determine the value of the 1000th integer by finding out what the 4th element is in the 56th cycle. Since the 4th element in the 56th cycle is 4, we can conclude that the 1000th integer is 4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
