    "problem": "A group of 10 Caltech students go to Lake Street for lunch. Each student eats at either Chipotle or Panda Express.  In how many different ways can the students collectively go to lunch?",
    "solution": "For each person, there are 2 choices: eat at Chipotle, or eat at Panda Express. To get the total number of outcomes, we multiply the number of possibilities for each person; $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 2 = 2^{10}=\\boxed{1024}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of choices for each student.\nEach of the 10 students can choose to eat at either Chipotle or Panda Express. This means each student has 2 options.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of different ways the students can go to lunch.\nTo find the total number of different ways the students can go to lunch, we need to calculate the number of possible combinations of choices for all 10 students. This can be done by raising the number of choices per student (which is 2) to the power of the total number of students (which is 10). The formula for this calculation is 2^10.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate 2^10.\n2^10 equals 1024.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1024}$"
