    "problem": "A license plate consists of two letters followed by two digits; for example, $MP78$. Neither the digits nor the letters may be repeated, and neither the letter $O$ nor the digit $0$ may be used. When reading from left to right, the letters must be in alphabetical order and the digits must be in increasing order. How many different license plate combinations are possible?",
    "solution": "Given any set of two distinct letters (neither of which is O) and two distinct digits (neither of which is 0), we can build exactly one license plate because, whatever the letters and digits, there is only one allowed order.  We can choose two distinct letters (excluding O) in $\\binom{25}{2}$ ways and two distinct digits (excluding 0) in $\\binom{9}{2}$ ways.  Thus the total number of license plates is $\\binom{25}{2}\\binom{9}{2} = \\boxed{10800}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the possible choices for the letters\nWe have 25 letters to choose from for the first letter, since we cannot use O. After choosing the first letter, there are 24 letters left for the second letter, since we must choose a letter that is in alphabetical order with the first letter and we cannot use O.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of possible letter combinations\nThe total number of possible letter combinations is 25 * 24 = 600.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the possible choices for the digits\nWe have 9 digits to choose from for the first digit, since we cannot use 0. After choosing the first digit, there are 8 digits left for the second digit, since we must choose a digit that is in increasing order with the first digit and we cannot use 0.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of possible digit combinations\nThe total number of possible digit combinations is 9 * 8 = 72.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of different license plate combinations\nWe multiply the number of possible letter combinations by the number of possible digit combinations to get the total number of different license plate combinations. total_combinations = 600 * 72 = 43200.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{43200}$"
