    "solution": "There are $7!$ ways to put the beads on the grid, not considering rotations and reflections. Arrangements can be reflected or not reflected and can be rotated by 0, 60, 120, 180, 240, or 300 degrees, so they come in groups of twelve equivalent arrangements. Correcting for the symmetries, we find that there are $7!/12=\\boxed{420}$ distinct arrangements.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem requires us to find the number of distinct ways to arrange seven beads of different colors on a hexagonal grid, considering reflections and rotations of an arrangement as equivalent.\n## Step 2:  The given grid has a symmetry group with 12 symmetries, which includes 6 rotations and 6 reflections. This means that any arrangement of the beads can be transformed into 12 different equivalent arrangements by applying these symmetries.\n## Step 3:  To solve this problem, we can start by calculating the total number of ways to arrange the beads on the hexagonal grid without considering any symmetries.\n## Step 4:  Since there are 7 distinct beads, there are $7!$ ways to arrange them on the grid without considering any symmetries.\n## Step 5:  However, we need to account for the symmetries to find the number of distinct arrangements.\n## Step 6:  Since there are 12 symmetries, each arrangement can be transformed into 12 equivalent arrangements by applying these symmetries.\n## Step 7:  To find the number of distinct arrangements, we divide the total number of arrangements ($7!$) by the number of equivalent arrangements due to symmetry ($12$).\n## Step 8:  This gives us $\\dfrac{7!}{12} = \\dfrac{7\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot1}{12} = 7\\cdot5\\cdot2\\cdot1 = 70$.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, there are $70$ distinct ways to arrange the seven beads of distinct colors on the hexagonal grid, considering reflections and rotations of an arrangement as equivalent.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{70}$"
