    "problem": "A bag contains two red beads and two green beads. You reach into the bag and pull out a bead, replacing it with a red bead regardless of the color you pulled out.  What is the probability that all beads in the bag are red after three such replacements? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The beads will all be red at the end of the third draw precisely when two  green beads are chosen in the three draws. If the first bead drawn is  green, then there will be one  green and three red beads in the bag before the second draw. So the probability that  green beads are drawn in the first two draws is $$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}= \\frac{1}{8}.\n$$ The probability that a  green bead is chosen, then a red bead, and then a  green bead, is $$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{32}.\n$$ Finally, the probability that a red bead is chosen then two  green beads is $$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}.\n$$ The sum of these probabilities is $$\n\\frac{1}{8}+ \\frac{3}{32}+ \\frac{1}{16}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{32}}.\n$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We need to calculate the probability of having all red beads in the bag after three replacements, given that it contains two red beads and two green beads initially.\n## Step 2:  The first step is to determine the probability of drawing a red bead in any given replacement. Since there are 2 red beads and 2 green beads initially, the probability of drawing a red bead is $\\frac{2}{4}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n## Step 3:  After drawing a red bead, it gets replaced with a new red bead, so the total number of red beads becomes 3, and the total number of beads becomes 4. Therefore, the probability of drawing a red bead in the next replacement remains $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n## Step 4:  We can continue this process for the third replacement, which also has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we need to calculate the probability of all three events happening in sequence, i.e., drawing a red bead in each of the three replacements.\n## Step 6:  The probability of all these events happening is given by the product of their individual probabilities, which is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the probability that all beads in the bag are red after three replacements is $\\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$"
