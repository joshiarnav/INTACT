    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, let's examine the problem and understand what is being asked. We have a grid with certain points labeled, and we need to find the number of paths from point $A$ to point $C$, where every step must be either up or to the right.\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we can first identify that in order to reach point $C$ from point $A$, we must take a total of $3$ steps to the right and $4$ steps upwards. Therefore, we need to find the total number of ways we can arrange these $3$ rightward steps within the $7$ total steps.\n## Step 3:  This is essentially a combinatorics problem, and it can be solved using combinations. We can calculate the number of ways to choose the positions of the rightward steps from the total $7$ steps using the combination formula, which is given by $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items and $r$ is the number of items to be chosen.\n## Step 4:  In this case, we have $7$ total steps, and we want to choose $3$ of them to be rightward steps. Therefore, the number of ways to do this is $\\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35$.\n## Step 5:  So, there are $35$ different paths from $A$ to $C$, with every step being either up or to the right.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{35}$"
