    "problem": "In how many ways can a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer be chosen from a group of $4$ guys and $4$ girls and at least one girl and at least one guy holds at least one of those three positions? One person cannot serve in more than one position.",
    "solution": "We have $8$ choices for president, $7$ choices for vice-president, and $6$ choices for treasurer, for a total of $8\\times7\\times6 = 336$ choices. Now we have to subtract the number of choices that don't satisfy the requirement, where the $3$ officers are all boys or all girls. For either case, we have $4$ choices for president, $3$ choices of vice-president, and $2$ choices for treasurer, a total of $4\\times3\\times2 = 24$ choices. So we have $2\\times 24 = 48$ total choices that don't satisfy the requirement.\n\nThus, there are $336-48=\\boxed{288}$ good choices.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, we need to determine the total number of ways to choose the President, Vice-President, and Treasurer from the group of 8 people.\n## Step 2:  There are 8 choices for the President, 7 choices for the Vice-President, and 6 choices for the Treasurer.\n## Step 3:  This gives us a total of $8 \\times 7 \\times 6 = 336$ ways to choose the three positions without any restrictions.\n## Step 4:  Next, we need to consider the cases where all three positions are held by guys, as we're required to have at least one guy and one girl in at least one of the positions.\n## Step 5:  If all three positions are held by guys, then there are 4 choices for the President, 3 choices for the Vice-President, and 2 choices for the Treasurer.\n## Step 6:  This results in $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24$ ways to choose the positions with only guys.\n## Step 7:  Similarly, if all three positions are held by girls, there are 4 choices for the President, 3 choices for the Vice-President, and 2 choices for the Treasurer, giving us another 24 ways.\n## Step 8:  To find the number of ways with at least one guy and one girl in at least one of the positions, we subtract the cases with only guys and only girls from the total number of ways.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the number of ways is $336 - 24 - 24 = \\boxed{288}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{288}$"
