    "problem": "How many different positive integers divisible by 4 can be formed using each of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 at most once, and no other digits? For example, 12 counts, but 512 does not.",
    "solution": "The only one-digit integer divisible by $4$ that we can construct is $4$.\n\nWe can construct $3$ two-digit integers divisible by $4$: $12$, $32$, and $24$.\n\nAn integer is divisible by $4$ if its rightmost two digits are divisible by $4$.  Thus we can append either or both of the remaining two digits to any of these two-digit integers and preserve divisibility by $4$.  For each, there are $2$ ways to choose one digit to append, and $2$ ways to order the digits if we append both of them.  Thus we get $4$ more integers for each, or $12$ total.\n\nThe full number is $12+3+1=\\boxed{16}$ integers.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are tasked with finding the number of different positive integers that are divisible by 4 and can be formed using each of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 at most once.\n## Step 2:  To be divisible by 4, the number formed must have its last two digits forming a number that is divisible by 4.\n## Step 3:  We can start by considering all possible arrangements of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 and then determine which of these arrangements meet the condition of being divisible by 4.\n## Step 4:  There are $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24$ possible permutations of the four digits.\n## Step 5:  However, we're only interested in the numbers that are divisible by 4, so we need to identify the pairs of digits that form multiples of 4.\n## Step 6:  The possible pairs of digits that form multiples of 4 are 12, 24, 32, and 4. We will consider each of these pairs and find the number of arrangements of the remaining digits.\n## Step 7:  If the pair is 12, we have 2 remaining digits, 3 and 4. These can be arranged in $2! = 2$ ways.\n## Step 8:  Similarly, if the pair is 24 or 32, we also have 2 remaining digits, which can be arranged in $2! = 2$ ways.\n## Step 9:  If the pair is 4, then we are left with the digits 1, 2, and 3. These can be arranged in $3! = 6$ ways.\n## Step 10:  By summing up the number of arrangements for each pair, we can find the total number of different positive integers that are divisible by 4 and can be formed using the given digits.\n## Step 11:  After calculating, we find that the total number of such integers is $2 + 2 + 2 + 6 = 12$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
