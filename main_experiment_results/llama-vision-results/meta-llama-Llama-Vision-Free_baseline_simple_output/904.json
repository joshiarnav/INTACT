    "solution": "The Binomial Theorem says that, to find the coefficient of $x^ay^b$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^{a+b}$, we choose $a$ of the $(a+b)$ terms to contribute $x$ to the product, then the other $b$ terms contribute a $y$. Similarly, to find the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in $(x+y+z)^8$, we choose 3 of the 8 $(x+y+z)$ terms in the product $(x+y+z)^8$ to contribute an $x$ (which we can do in $\\binom{8}{3}$ ways), 3 of the remaining 5 terms to contribute a $y$ (which we can do in $\\binom{5}{3}$ ways), and the remaining 2 terms contribute $z$'s to the product. Thus, our answer is  \\[\\binom{8}{3}\\binom{5}{3}=56\\cdot 10=\\boxed{560}\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We need to find the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$. The expansion of a multinomial expression can be found using the multinomial theorem.\n## Step 2:  According to the multinomial theorem, the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$ is given by $\\sum_{n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 8} \\binom{8}{n_1, n_2, n_3} x^{n_1} y^{n_2} z^{n_3}$, where $\\binom{8}{n_1, n_2, n_3}$ represents the multinomial coefficient.\n## Step 3:  We are interested in the term $x^3y^3z^2$, which corresponds to the case where $n_1=3$, $n_2=3$, and $n_3=2$.\n## Step 4:  To find the coefficient of this term, we need to calculate the multinomial coefficient $\\binom{8}{3, 3, 2}$.\n## Step 5:  The multinomial coefficient can be calculated using the formula $\\binom{8}{3, 3, 2} = \\frac{8!}{3!3!2!}$.\n## Step 6:  Calculating the value of the multinomial coefficient, we get $\\binom{8}{3, 3, 2} = \\frac{8!}{3!3!2!} = \\frac{8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 56$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$ is $56$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{56}$"
