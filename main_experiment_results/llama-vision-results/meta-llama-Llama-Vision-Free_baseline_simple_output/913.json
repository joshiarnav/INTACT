    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the type of problem\nThis problem involves counting distinct arrangements of indistinguishable objects, which can be solved using combinatorics.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the total number of objects\nThe mathematical prodigy has 2 indistinguishable IMO gold medals and 2 indistinguishable IPhO gold medals, for a total of 4 objects.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the arrangements as a string of symbols\nWe can represent the arrangements as a string of 4 symbols, where each symbol is either an IMO gold medal (G) or an IPhO gold medal (g).\n\n## Step 4: Count the number of distinct arrangements\nSince the medals of the same type are indistinguishable, we only need to count the number of distinct arrangements of the two types of medals. This can be done using combinations with repetition.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of distinct arrangements\nWe need to choose the positions of the 2 IMO gold medals (or equivalently, the positions of the 2 IPhO gold medals) out of the 4 available positions. This can be done in $\\binom{4}{2}=\\frac{4!}{2!2!}=6$ ways.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the arrangements as a string of 4 positions\nThe 6 arrangements can be represented as the following strings of 4 positions: GGgg, GgGg, GggG, ggGG, gGGg, ggGg.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the arrangements as a string of 4 symbols with two type of medals\nThe string of 4 symbols can have the following arrangements:\nGgGg, GGGg, GgGG, ggGG, ggGg, GggG.\n\n## Step 8: Counting the distinct arrangement of the medals\nThere are 6 possible arrangements of the medals.\n\n## Step 9: Calculating the total number of distinct arrangements\nThere are 6 distinct arrangements.\n\n## Step 10: Writing the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
