    "problem": "A nursery employee wishes to plant 2 identical Golden Delicious apple trees and 5 identical Bartlett pear trees in one row. How many distinct arrangements are possible?",
    "solution": "We have 7 places to plant trees in our row.  We can choose two of these to be Golden Delicious in $\\binom{7}{2}= \\boxed{21}$ ways.  For each of these choices, we plant the Bartlett pears in the remaining 5 places.",
    "total_tokens": 392,

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of trees to be planted\nThe total number of trees to be planted is 2 (Golden Delicious apple trees) + 5 (Bartlett pear trees) = 7 trees.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of distinct arrangements using the formula for permutations of a multiset\nThe number of distinct arrangements can be calculated using the formula for permutations of a multiset: n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!), where n is the total number of objects, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the numbers of each type of indistinguishable object. In this case, n = 7 (total trees), n1 = 2 (Golden Delicious apple trees), and n2 = 5 (Bartlett pear trees).\n\n## Step 3: Apply the formula to calculate the number of distinct arrangements\nUsing the formula, the number of distinct arrangements is 7! / (2! * 5!). First, calculate the factorial of 7: 7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040. Then, calculate the factorial of 2: 2! = 2 * 1 = 2. Next, calculate the factorial of 5: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. Now, divide the factorial of 7 by the product of the factorials of 2 and 5: 5040 / (2 * 120) = 5040 / 240 = 21.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$"
