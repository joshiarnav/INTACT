    "problem": "Let $F$ be the first digit and $L$ be the last digit of the expanded integer form of $2007^3$. What is the value of $F + L$?",
    "solution": "We can rewrite $2007^3$ as the cube of a binomial: \\begin{align*}\n2007^3 &= (2\\cdot 10^3 + 7)^3\\\\\n&= \\binom{3}{0} (2\\cdot 10^3)^3 + \\cdots + \\binom{3}{3} 7^3\n\\end{align*}\n\nOnly the first and last term of the binomial expansion affect the values of $F$ and $L$. The first term is equal to $8\\cdot 10^9$, so $F = 8$. The last term is equal to 343, so $L = 3$. Therefore, $F + L = \\boxed{11}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to find the expanded integer form of $2007^3$.\n## Step 2:  We can start by expanding $2007^3$ using the formula $(a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$. Here, $a=2000$ and $b=7$.\n## Step 3:  Substituting these values into the formula, we get $(2000+7)^3 = 2000^3 + 3\\cdot 2000^2 \\cdot 7 + 3\\cdot 2000 \\cdot 7^2 + 7^3$.\n## Step 4:  Simplifying this expression, we get $2000^3 + 4200000 + 441000 + 343$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we need to calculate the value of each term. $2000^3$ can be calculated as $8,000,000,000$. $4200000$ is equal to $4,200,000$. $441000$ is equal to $441,000$, and $343$ is simply $343$.\n## Step 6:  Adding these values together, we get $8,000,000,000 + 4,200,000 + 441,000 + 343$.\n## Step 7:  This simplifies to $8,444,644,343$.\n## Step 8:  Now, we are interested in the first and last digits of this number, denoted by $F$ and $L$ respectively.\n## Step 9:  The first digit $F$ is $8$ and the last digit $L$ is $3$.\n## Step 10:  To find the value of $F + L$, we simply add $8$ and $3$ together, giving us $11$.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the value of $F + L$ is $\\boxed{11}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$"
