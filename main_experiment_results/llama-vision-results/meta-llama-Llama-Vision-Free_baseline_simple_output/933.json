    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem involves analyzing the pattern in Pascal's triangle to determine the number of rows that contain at least one even entry and no odd entries other than 1 within the first 100 rows.\n## Step 2:  We can start by understanding how to identify rows with the desired property. A row with the property will contain at least one even entry and no odd entries other than 1. This means that all entries in the row must be even, except for the 1's at the beginning and end.\n## Step 3:  To find such rows, we look for rows that have only 1's at the ends and all other entries are even.\n## Step 4:  If a row $n$ has the property, then we know that $n$ must be a power of 2, because the $k$th number in row $n$ is given by the combination ${n \\choose k}$.\n## Step 5:  Furthermore, we need to check if the row contains any odd entries other than 1. We find that the only odd entries in a row $n$ are in the positions $k$ and $n-k$ for $k$ ranging from $1$ to $\\frac{n}{2}-1$. Therefore, if $n$ is a power of 2, then we can express it as $n=2^m$, and we need to check whether ${2^m \\choose k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$ for $k$ ranging from $1$ to $2^{m-1}-1$.\n## Step 6:  We can simplify this expression using the combination formula and modular arithmetic. By doing this, we can find the condition for the row $n$ to have the desired property.\n## Step 7:  After identifying the condition for a row to have the property, we need to find the number of rows within the first 100 rows that satisfy this condition.\n## Step 8:  We notice that the first 100 rows correspond to $m=0,1,2,...,96$, and we need to count the rows for each of these values of $m$.\n## Step 9:  To determine the number of valid rows for each $m$, we need to count the number of multiples of 4 within the range of $m$.\n## Step 10:  After finding the valid rows for each $m$, we sum up the counts for all $m$ to get the total number of rows that satisfy the condition.\n## Step 11:  The final count gives us the number of rows in the first 100 rows of Pascal's triangle that contain at least one even entry and no odd entries other than 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{26}$"
