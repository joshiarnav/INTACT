    "problem": "Two jokers are added to a $52$ card deck and the entire stack of $54$ cards is shuffled randomly.  What is the expected number of cards that will be strictly between the two jokers?",
    "solution": "Each card has an equal likelihood of being either on top of the jokers, in between them, or below the jokers.  Thus, on average, $1/3$ of them will land between the two jokers. Multiplying this by the 52 yields our answer of $\\boxed{\\frac{52}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are asked to find the expected number of cards that will be strictly between the two jokers in a shuffled deck of 54 cards, including two jokers.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the position of the two jokers\nThe two jokers can be placed in any position in the deck, but we are interested in the cards between them.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of cards between the two jokers\nFor any given position of the first joker, there are 52 cards that can come before it. After the first joker, there will be 51 cards remaining that can come after it. However, we are interested in the cards strictly between the two jokers. Thus, we need to consider the position of the second joker as well.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of a specific card being between the two jokers\nIf we fix the position of the first joker at $i$, then the position of the second joker can be at any position from $i+1$ to $53$. The probability of a specific card being between the two jokers is the number of ways to place the second joker after the first joker, divided by the total number of ways to arrange the cards.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the expected number of cards between the two jokers\nWe can use the linearity of expectation to find the expected number of cards between the two jokers. For each card in the deck, we calculate the probability that it is between the two jokers, and then sum up these probabilities.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of a specific card being between the two jokers\nFor a given card at position $i$ in the deck, the probability that it is between the two jokers is $\\frac{52-i}{53}$. This is because if the first joker is placed at position $i$, the second joker can be placed at any position from $i+1$ to $53$, and the probability of the second joker being placed after the first joker is $\\frac{52-i}{53}$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the expected number of cards between the two jokers\nWe can use the linearity of expectation to find the expected number of cards between the two jokers. The expected number of cards between the two jokers is given by $\\sum_{i=1}^{52} \\frac{52-i}{53}$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the sum\nThe sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. We have $\\sum_{i=1}^{52} \\frac{52-i}{53} = \\frac{1}{53} \\sum_{i=1}^{52} (52-i) = \\frac{1}{53} \\left( 52 \\cdot 52 - \\frac{52 \\cdot 51}{2} \\right)$.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying the expression, we get $\\frac{1}{53} \\left( 52 \\cdot 52 - \\frac{52 \\cdot 51}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{53} \\left( 2704 - 1326 \\right) = \\frac{1378}{53}$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the fraction\nSimplifying the fraction, we get $\\frac{1378}{53} = 26$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{26}$"
