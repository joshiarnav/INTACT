    "problem": "Set $R$ is a set of rectangles such that (1) only the grid points shown here are used as vertices, (2) all sides are vertical or horizontal and (3) no two rectangles in the set are congruent. If $R$ contains the maximum possible number of rectangles given these conditions, what fraction of the rectangles in set $R$ are squares? Express your answer as a common fraction.

    "solution": "If we list out the possible sizes of the rectangles, we have: \\begin{align*}\n&1\\times1, \\ 1\\times2, \\ 1\\times3, \\ 1\\times4, \\\\\n&2\\times2, \\ 2\\times3, \\ 2\\times4, \\\\\n&3\\times3, \\ 3\\times4,\\text{ and} \\\\\n&4\\times4.\n\\end{align*} Thus, there are ten possible sizes, each of which must be represented by one rectangle in set $R.$ Four of these sizes are squares, so the fraction in $R$ that are squares is $\\frac{4}{10} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To maximize the number of rectangles in the set $R$ given the conditions, we need to carefully consider the arrangements of rectangles that satisfy all the given criteria.\n## Step 2:  Firstly, we note that only grid points as vertices are allowed, and all sides are either vertical or horizontal.\n## Step 3:  We also know that no two rectangles in the set should be congruent, which implies that the arrangement should be such that each rectangle is unique.\n## Step 4:  To start, we need to identify the different possible side lengths of the rectangles. By observing the grid, we can see that the side lengths can be 1, 2, or $\\sqrt{2}$.\n## Step 5:  Next, we want to count the number of rectangles of each side length. We can systematically count the number of rectangles for each side length and keep track of the count.\n## Step 6:  For a side length of 1, we can count the number of rectangles with side length 1 by visually counting them on the grid.\n## Step 7:  Similarly, for a side length of 2, we can count the number of rectangles with side length 2 and keep track of the count.\n## Step 8:  Lastly, for a side length of $\\sqrt{2}$, we can count the number of rectangles with this side length and add it to our total count.\n## Step 9:  Once we have the count for each side length, we can calculate the total number of rectangles in the set $R$ by summing up the counts.\n## Step 10:  Now that we have the total count of rectangles, we need to determine the number of squares among these rectangles.\n## Step 11:  We can identify the squares as the rectangles with side length 1 and side length 2, as well as the rectangles with both side lengths being $\\sqrt{2}$.\n## Step 12:  After counting the squares, we can calculate the fraction of rectangles in set $R$ that are squares by dividing the count of squares by the total count of rectangles.\n## Step 13:  This will give us the required fraction of rectangles in set $R$ that are squares.\n\n## Step 14:  To determine the total number of rectangles, we can count the rectangles with side length 1, side length 2, and side length $\\sqrt{2}$, and then sum these counts to get the total.\n\n## Step 15:  Calculating the counts:\n## Step 16:  Rectangles with side length 1: There are 8 such rectangles.\n## Step 17:  Rectangles with side length 2: There are 7 such rectangles.\n## Step 18:  Rectangles with side length $\\sqrt{2}$: There are 5 such rectangles.\n## Step 19:  Therefore, the total number of rectangles is $8 + 7 + 5 = 20$.\n\n## Step 20:  Next, we need to count the number of squares among these rectangles. We can identify the squares by their side lengths.\n\n## Step 21:  Counting the squares:\n## Step 22:  Squares with side length 1: There are 4 such squares.\n## Step 23:  Squares with side length 2: There is 1 such square.\n## Step 24:  Therefore, the total number of squares is $4 + 1 = 5$.\n\n## Step 25:  With the total count of rectangles and the count of squares, we can now calculate the fraction of rectangles in set $R$ that are squares.\n\n## Step 26:  The fraction of rectangles in set $R$ that are squares is given by the ratio of the count of squares to the total count of rectangles.\n## Step 27:  Therefore, the fraction of rectangles that are squares is $\\frac{5}{20} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$"
