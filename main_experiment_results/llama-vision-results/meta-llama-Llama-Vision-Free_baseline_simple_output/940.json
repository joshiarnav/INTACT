    "solution": "Since $9^4=9(9^3)$ and $9^5=9^2\\cdot9^3=81(9^3)$, we must count the number of integers between 10 and 80, inclusive. That number is $80-10+1=71$, so there are $\\boxed{71}$ multiples of $9^3$ greater than $9^4$ and less than $9^5$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We need to find the number of multiples of $9^3$ that are greater than $9^4$ and less than $9^5$.\n## Step 2:  To start, we can express the conditions as inequalities involving $9^3$.\n## Step 3:  We want to find the number of multiples of $9^3$ that fall within the range of $9^4$ and $9^5$, which translates to $9^4 < k < 9^5$, where $k$ represents the multiples of $9^3$.\n## Step 4:  We can equivalently express the inequality as $9^4 < k < 9^5$ as $9^4/9^3 < k/9^3 < 9^5/9^3$.\n## Step 5:  This simplifies to $9 < k/9^3 < 9^2$, which means $k$ must be greater than $9 \\cdot 9^3$ and less than $9^2 \\cdot 9^3$.\n## Step 6:  Further simplifying, we get $9^4 < k < 9^6$, which means we are looking for multiples of $9^3$ within this range.\n## Step 7:  As the multiples of $9^3$ are of the form $9^3 \\cdot n$, where $n$ is an integer, we need to find the range of $n$ that satisfies the given inequality.\n## Step 8:  The inequality $9^4 < k < 9^6$ translates to $9^4/9^3 < n < 9^6/9^3$, which gives us $9 < n < 9^3$.\n## Step 9:  This implies that we are looking for the multiples of $9^3$ within the range $9 < n < 9^3$, which means $n$ can take values from $9 + 1$ to $9^3 - 1$, as these are the possible multiples.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the number of multiples of $9^3$ within the given range is $9^3 - (9 + 1) = 729 - 10 = 719$.\n## Step 11:  So, there are $\\boxed{719}$ multiples of $9^3$ that are greater than $9^4$ and less than $9^5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{719}$"
