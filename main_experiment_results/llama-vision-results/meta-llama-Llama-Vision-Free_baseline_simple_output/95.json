    "problem": "What is the probability that flipping a fair coin three times produces fewer than two heads? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "This is the probability of flipping no heads (three tails) or one head (two tails). This is the same as the probability of flipping two heads (one tail) or three heads (no tails), since we can just interchange heads and tails. Since all outcomes are covered, both probabilities add up to 1, so the desired probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem involves finding the probability of flipping a fair coin three times and getting fewer than two heads. This means we are looking for the scenarios where we get 0 heads or 1 head.\n## Step 2:  To start, let's list all the possible outcomes when flipping a coin three times. Since each flip can result in either heads (H) or tails (T), there are $2^3 = 8$ total outcomes.\n## Step 3:  Now, we need to identify the outcomes that result in fewer than two heads. This includes the outcomes with 0 heads and those with 1 head.\n## Step 4:  The outcomes with 0 heads are TTT.\n## Step 5:  The outcomes with 1 head are HTT, THT, and TTH.\n## Step 6:  Having identified these outcomes, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.\n## Step 7:  There are 3 outcomes with 1 head and 1 outcome with 0 heads, giving us a total of 4 favorable outcomes.\n## Step 8:  The total number of outcomes is 8, since each flip has 2 possibilities and we're flipping the coin 3 times.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes (4) divided by the total number of outcomes (8).\n## Step 10:  This simplifies to $\\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$"
