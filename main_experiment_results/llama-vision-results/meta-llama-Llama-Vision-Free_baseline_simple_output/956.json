    "problem": "Two numbers between $0$ and $1$ on a number line are to be chosen at random. What is the probability that the second number chosen will exceed the first number chosen by a distance greater than $\\frac 14$ unit on the number line? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that the second number is more than $\\frac14$ unit greater than the first number decreases linearly from $\\frac34$ to $0$ as the first number increases linearly from $0$ to $\\frac34$. The average of this probability is $\\frac12 \\cdot \\frac34= \\frac38$. Since there is a $\\frac34$ chance of choosing a number from $0$ to $\\frac34$, the probability is $\\frac34 \\cdot \\frac38 = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{32}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the nature of the question. We are tasked with finding the probability that the second number chosen from a set of two random numbers between $0$ and $1$ on a number line exceeds the first number chosen by a distance greater than $\\frac{1}{4}$ unit.\n## Step 2:  It's easier to approach this problem by considering the complement of the event we are interested in. The complement of the event is when the two numbers are chosen such that the second number does not exceed the first number by a distance greater than $\\frac{1}{4}$ unit. In other words, the second number is either less than the first number or the second number is less than the first number by a distance of $\\frac{1}{4}$ or less.\n## Step 3:  Visualizing this on a number line, we can see that the total area of a square representing all possible outcomes is $1 \\times 1 = 1$. We then need to find the area of the region where the second number does not exceed the first number by a distance greater than $\\frac{1}{4}$ unit.\n## Step 4:  This area consists of two triangles, each of base $\\frac{3}{4}$ and height $1$. The combined area of these two triangles is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 2 = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n## Step 5:  The probability that the second number chosen will exceed the first number chosen by a distance greater than $\\frac{1}{4}$ unit is therefore $1 - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$"
