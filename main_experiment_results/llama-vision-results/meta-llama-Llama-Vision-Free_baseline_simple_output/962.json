    "problem": "We call a number a descending number if each digit is strictly smaller than the digit that comes before it.  For example, 863 is a descending number.  How many 3-digit descending numbers are there?",
    "solution": "For every 3 different digits, there is one corresponding descending number, which is just the digits in descending order.  So the answer is the number of combinations of three different digits, which is  $\\binom{10}{3} = \\boxed{120}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem\nWe need to find the number of 3-digit descending numbers, where each digit is strictly smaller than the digit that comes before it.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the possible choices for the first digit\nSince the number is 3-digit, the first digit cannot be 0. Therefore, there are 9 possible choices for the first digit: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the possible choices for the second digit\nGiven the first digit, the second digit must be smaller than the first digit. Therefore, there are 9 possible choices for the second digit, but one less than the first digit. For example, if the first digit is 8, then the second digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. So, the number of choices for the second digit depends on the first digit.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the possible choices for the third digit\nGiven the first two digits, the third digit must be smaller than the second digit. Therefore, there are 9 possible choices for the third digit, but two less than the first digit. For example, if the first digit is 8 and the second digit is 5, then the third digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the number of choices for the third digit depends on the first two digits.\n\n## Step 5: Recognize that step 4 was mistaken and revise it.\nThe third digit can be any digit that is smaller than the second digit. Therefore, it can be any digit from 0 up to but not including the second digit.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of 3-digit descending numbers\nLet's first calculate the total number of choices for the three digits.\nFor the first digit, there are 9 choices.\nFor the second digit, there are 9 choices.\nFor the third digit, the number of choices depends on the first two digits.\n\n## Step 7: Correct the calculation for the third digit\nFor each choice of the first two digits, the third digit can be any of the 9 digits, but it must be less than the second digit. Therefore, there are 9-1=8 choices for the third digit, regardless of the first two digits.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total number of 3-digit descending numbers using the correct information\nTo correctly calculate the total number of 3-digit descending numbers, we must multiply the number of choices for each digit together.\n\n## Step 9: Multiply the number of choices for each digit together\nThere are 9 choices for the first digit, 9 choices for the second digit, and 8 choices for the third digit.\n\n## Step 10: Perform the multiplication\nTotal number of 3-digit descending numbers = 9 * 9 * 8 = 648\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{648}$"
