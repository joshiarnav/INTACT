    "problem": "I have two cubes such that, on each cube, three faces are painted red and three faces are painted white. If I roll each of the cubes once, what is the probability that they will land such that there is one red face and one white face up?",
    "solution": "There are four possible ways for the cubes to land: two red faces up, the first with a red face and the second with a white face up, the first with a white face and the second with a red face up, and two white faces up. So, there are two ways that the cubes can land such that there is a red face up and a white face up. The probability that we get a red face up is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, the probability that we get a white face up is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the probability that the cubes land such that there is one red face and one white face up is $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\nAlternate solution: After you roll the first cube, the second one must be the other color, which occurs with probability $\\frac{3}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the possible outcomes for each cube when rolled\nEach cube has 6 faces in total. For each cube, there are 3 red faces and 3 white faces. Therefore, when rolling one cube, there are 3 possible outcomes where a red face is up and 3 possible outcomes where a white face is up.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of combinations for both cubes that result in one red and one white face\nTo have one red and one white face up after rolling both cubes, we consider the two scenarios: having one red face and one white face on the first cube and the opposite on the second (red then white) or vice versa (white then red). For the first cube, there are 3 ways to get a red face and 3 ways to get a white face. The same goes for the second cube. Therefore, the total number of combinations that result in one red and one white face is 3*3*3*3.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total possible outcomes when rolling both cubes\nSince each cube has 6 faces and we are rolling two cubes, the total possible outcomes are 6*6.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of having one red face and one white face up\nTo find the probability, we divide the total number of combinations that result in one red and one white face by the total possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the fraction obtained from the probability calculation\nWe calculate the probability as (3*3*3*3)/(6*6) which simplifies to 81/36.\n\n## Step 6: Further simplify the fraction to obtain the final probability\nThe fraction 81/36 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9. This results in 9/4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{4}}$"
