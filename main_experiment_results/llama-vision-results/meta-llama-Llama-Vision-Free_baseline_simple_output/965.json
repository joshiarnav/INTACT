    "problem": "A Senate committee consists of 5 Republicans, 6 Democrats, and 2 Independents.  A subcommittee of 3 members is randomly chosen.  What is the probability that the subcommittee consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent?",
    "solution": "There are 5 ways to choose a Republican, 6 ways to choose a Democrat, and 2 ways to choose an Independent for a total of $5 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 60$ different subcommittees of a Republican, Democrat, and Independent.   There are $\\binom{13}{3} = \\dfrac{13\\cdot12\\cdot 11}{3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1} = 286$ ways to choose 3 people from 13 to form a committee, so there are 286 possible committees. Therefore, the probability that the subcommittee is made up of a Republican, Democrat, and Independent is $\\dfrac{60}{286} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{30}{143}}$ .",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members out of the total 13 members\nThe total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members out of 13 is given by the combination formula $C(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where n is the total number of members and r is the number of members in the subcommittee. In this case, $n = 13$ and $r = 3$, so the total number of ways is $C(13, 3) = \\frac{13!}{3!(13-3)!} = \\frac{13!}{3!10!}$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the expression for the total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members\nSimplifying the expression for the total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members, we get $\\frac{13!}{3!10!} = \\frac{13\\cdot12\\cdot11}{3\\cdot2\\cdot1} = 286$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent\nThe number of ways to choose 1 Republican out of 5 is given by $C(5, 1) = 5$, the number of ways to choose 1 Democrat out of 6 is given by $C(6, 1) = 6$, and the number of ways to choose 1 Independent out of 2 is given by $C(2, 1) = 2$. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent is $5\\cdot6\\cdot2 = 60$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that the subcommittee consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent\nThe probability that the subcommittee consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent is given by the ratio of the number of ways to choose 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent to the total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members. This is equal to $\\frac{60}{286}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the fraction to find the final probability\nThe fraction $\\frac{60}{286}$ can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. This gives $\\frac{30}{143}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{30}{143}}$"
