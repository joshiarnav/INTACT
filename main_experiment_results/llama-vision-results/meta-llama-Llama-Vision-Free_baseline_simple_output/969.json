    "problem": "Two real numbers are chosen at random between $0$ and $2.$ What is the probability that the sum of their squares is no more than $4?$ Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "We let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$.  The set of all possible pairs $(x,y)$ satisfy the inequalities $0<x<2$ and $0<y<2$; we can graph these points as a square on the $x-y$ plane with vertices $(0,0),(2,0),(2,2)$ and $(0,2)$.  This square has area $4.$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1.5 cm);\n\nfilldraw(arc((0,0),2,0,90)--(0,0)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2)--cycle);\n\nlabel(\"$0$\", (0,0), S);\nlabel(\"$2$\", (2,0), S);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (2,0), E);\nlabel(\"$0$\", (0,0), W);\nlabel(\"$2$\", (0,2), W);\nlabel(\"$y$\", (0,2), N);\n[/asy]\n\nWe want to find the area of the set of points which also satisfies $x^2+y^2\\le 4$.

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem and understand the conditions\nWe are choosing two real numbers at random between $0$ and $2.$ The condition we are interested in is the sum of their squares being no more than $4.$ Let's denote the two numbers as $x$ and $y.$ Therefore, we want $x^2 + y^2 \\leq 4.$\n\n## Step 2: Visualize the problem in a two-dimensional space\nTo understand the region that satisfies the given condition, we can visualize it in a two-dimensional space where the x-axis represents $x$ and the y-axis represents $y.$ The condition $x^2 + y^2 \\leq 4$ defines a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 2.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the area of the circle that satisfies the condition\nThe area of the circle where the condition is satisfied can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle, which is $A = \\pi r^2,$ where $r$ is the radius. Since the radius of the circle is 2, the area is $A = \\pi \\cdot 2^2 = 4\\pi.$ However, this is the whole area of the circle up to the point where the circle is at the boundaries of the square defined by the range $[0, 2].$\n\n## Step 4: Determine the area of the square that defines the sample space\nThe sample space is defined by the square with side length 2, so the area of the square is $2^2 = 4.$\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square\nThe probability that the sum of the squares of the two numbers is no more than $4$ is equal to the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square. This ratio is $\\frac{4\\pi}{4}.$\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the ratio\nSimplifying the ratio, we get $\\frac{4\\pi}{4} = \\pi.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\pi}$"
