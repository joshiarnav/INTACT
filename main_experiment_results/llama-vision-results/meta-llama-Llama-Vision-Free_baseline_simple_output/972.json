    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word CIRCLE, we first note that there are 7 letters in total.\n## Step 2:  Since some letters repeat, we must account for the repeated letters to avoid overcounting. Specifically, there are 2 repeated letters: 2 C's and 2 I's, and 2 L's.\n## Step 3:  For a word with repeated letters, the total number of arrangements is given by the formula $\\dfrac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\\cdots n_k!}$, where $n$ is the total number of letters and $n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k$ are the counts of the repeated letters.\n## Step 4:  In the case of the word CIRCLE, we have 7 letters in total ($n=7$) and the repeated letters are C (appears twice), I (appears twice), and L (appears twice).\n## Step 5:  Plugging these values into the formula, we get $\\dfrac{7!}{2!\\cdot 2!\\cdot 2!}$.\n## Step 6:  We can simplify this expression further by calculating the factorials and performing the division.\n## Step 7:  First, we find that $7! = 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 5040$.\n## Step 8:  Then, we find that $2! = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$, and since we have $2!$ three times in the denominator, we need to calculate $2! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 2! = 8$.\n## Step 9:  Now, we can rewrite the expression as $\\dfrac{5040}{8}$.\n## Step 10:  Finally, we simplify this expression to find the total number of arrangements.\n## Step 11:  Dividing $5040$ by $8$ gives us $630$.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{630}$ ways to arrange the letters of the word CIRCLE.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{630}$"
