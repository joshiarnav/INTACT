    "problem": "January 1, 2007 was a Monday. In 2007, how many Fridays are there?",
    "solution": "There were 365 days in 2007, and since $364=7\\cdot52$, there were $52$ full weeks and $1$ more day in the year. So there were $\\boxed{52}$ Fridays.",
    "total_tokens": 427,

    "file_name": "./MATH/test/counting_and_probability/973.json",
    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of days in 2007.\n2007 is not a leap year, so it has 365 days.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of weeks in 2007.\nSince there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of days by 7 to find the number of weeks. 365 / 7 = 52 with a remainder of 1.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of Fridays in 2007.\nSince we know that every week has one Friday and there are 52 weeks in 2007, we can calculate the total number of Fridays. However, since 2007 has 1 day left over after 52 weeks, we need to determine if that leftover day is a Friday.\n\n## Step 4: Determine if January 1, 2007 being a Monday affects the number of Fridays in 2007.\nJanuary 1, 2007 being a Monday does not directly impact the number of Fridays in 2007 because the pattern of days of the week repeats every 7 days. However, we need to consider the leftover day after 52 weeks.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the day of the week for January 1, 2007 plus 365 days.\nJanuary 1, 2007 is a Monday. We need to find the day of the week 365 days later. Since 365 is 1 week and 1 day, January 1, 2008 will be a Tuesday.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of Fridays in 2007.\nEvery 7 days, there is one Friday. Since there are 52 complete weeks in 2007, there are 52 Fridays. The leftover day after 52 weeks is not a Friday (as Tuesday is the leftover day), so we only count the Fridays in the complete weeks.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{52}$"
