    "problem": "If we flip 6 coins, what is the probability of getting at least 2 heads?",
    "solution": "There are $2^6 = 64$ possible outcomes, since each of the 6 coins has 2 possibilities.  If we do not get at least 2 heads, then we get either no heads or one heads.  There is only 1 way to get 0 heads, and $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to get 1 head, so the probability of getting at most one head is $\\dfrac{7}{64}$.  Therefore, the probability of getting at least 2 heads is $1-\\dfrac{7}{64}=\\boxed{\\frac{57}{64}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks for the probability of getting at least 2 heads when flipping 6 coins.\n## Step 2:  To solve this, we first need to understand the total number of outcomes when flipping 6 coins. Since each coin has 2 possible outcomes, heads or tails, the total number of outcomes for 6 coins is $2^6 = 64$.\n## Step 3:  The next step is to find the number of ways to get exactly 2 heads, 3 heads, 4 heads, 5 heads, and 6 heads, and sum them up to find the total number of successful outcomes.\n## Step 4:  We can calculate the number of ways to get exactly $k$ heads out of $n$ coin flips using the binomial coefficient formula $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where \"n choose k\" represents the number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $n$ distinct items.\n## Step 5:  Plugging in the values, we get $\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15$, $\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = 20$, $\\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = 15$, $\\binom{6}{5} = \\frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = 6$, and $\\binom{6}{6} = \\frac{6!}{6!(6-6)!} = 1$.\n## Step 6:  The total number of successful outcomes is the sum of these values, which is $15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 57$.\n## Step 7:  Finally, we can calculate the probability of getting at least 2 heads by dividing the total number of successful outcomes by the total number of outcomes, which is $\\frac{57}{64}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{57}{64}}$"
