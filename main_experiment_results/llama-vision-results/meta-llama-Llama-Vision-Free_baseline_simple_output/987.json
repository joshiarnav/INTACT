    "problem": "23 people attend a party. Each person shakes hands with at least one other person. What is the minimum possible number of handshakes?",
    "solution": "If each person shakes hands with exactly one other person, then there will be $\\frac{23 \\cdot 1}{2}$ handshakes, since two people are required to complete a handshake. This is equal to 11.5 handshakes, which is clearly impossible. We can achieve 12 handshakes by forming two rows of 11 and 12 people. Each person in the first row shakes hands a different person in the second row. This will give eleven handshakes. The leftover person must shake hands with someone, giving $\\boxed{12}$ handshakes total.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the minimum number of handshakes required for a single person.\nTo minimize the number of handshakes, we want each person to shake hands with as few other people as possible. The minimum number of handshakes for a single person is 1.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total minimum number of handshakes for all 23 people.\nIf each person shakes hands with one other person, we might initially think that 23 handshakes occur. However, this counts each handshake twice (once for each person involved in the handshake). To find the total number of handshakes, we divide the total number of handshakes counted by 2.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the handshake formula to find the minimum number of handshakes.\nThe formula is: (total number of people * minimum handshakes per person) / 2.\n\n## Step 4: Plug in the numbers and calculate the result.\n(total number of people * minimum handshakes per person) / 2 = (23 * 1) / 2 = 11.5.\n\n## Step 5: Since you can't have half a handshake, round up to the nearest integer.\nHowever, because we are looking for the minimum number of handshakes and we've determined that each person must shake hands with at least one other person, we must consider the fact that 23 people cannot all shake hands with just one other person without at least one pair of people shaking hands with each other, which would be counted twice in the initial calculation.\n\n## Step 6: Recalculate considering that the initial calculation doesn't account for the fact that a handshake between two people is counted twice.\nFor each person to shake hands with at least one other person, the minimum would be if one person shook hands with another, and the rest shook hands with only the first two. However, this would still not give us an integer result when dividing by 2. So we must adjust our thinking to consider that since each handshake is counted twice, the formula must actually reflect that. We need to consider the actual minimum number that allows for all individuals to have at least one handshake, while minimizing the total count.\n\n## Step 7: Adjust the calculation to reflect the actual scenario.\nGiven that each person must shake hands with at least one other, the actual calculation should consider the minimum to achieve this while avoiding the division by 2. This is actually a classic problem that can be solved more intuitively. If we have 23 people, the first person shakes hands with one other person, the second person shakes hands with the first, and so on until the 23rd person. However, this counts each handshake twice, so we divide by 2. But to avoid confusion, let's consider the scenario where we have two groups of people that are not connected by handshakes to start with, and then make them connected.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the logic to get the right answer.\nImagine 22 people sitting in a circle and one person standing in the middle. Each person in the circle shakes hands with the person next to them. The person standing in the middle doesn't shake hands with anyone. This way, there are 22 handshakes, and we're left with the person standing in the middle who doesn't shake hands with anyone else. Now we need to find the minimum number of handshakes to add to the 22 already there so that all 23 people have shaken hands with at least one other person.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the minimum number of handshakes needed to include the last person.\nSince the last person needs to shake hands with at least one other person, and the only other person available is one of the people in the circle, that person will shake hands with the last person. This will add one more handshake to the total of 22.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the final total.\nThe final total number of handshakes is 22 (from the circle) + 1 (the additional handshake) = 23.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{23}$"
