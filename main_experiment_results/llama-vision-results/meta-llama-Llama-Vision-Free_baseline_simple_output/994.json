    "problem": "How many of the natural numbers from $1$ to $800,$ inclusive, contain the digit $6$ at least twice? (The numbers $266$ and $663$ are two natural numbers that contain the digit $6$ at least twice, but $430$ or $16$ are not.)",
    "solution": "There are $10$ numbers with a $6$ in the hundreds place and a $6$ in the units place.\n\nThere are $10$ numbers with a $6$ in the hundreds place and a $6$ in the tens place.\n\nThere are $8$ numbers with a $6$ in the tens place and a $6$ in the units place. (Remember, we only have the numbers from $1$ to $800.$)\n\nAdding them up, we have $10+10+8 = 28.$ However, we counted $666$ three times. Therefore subtract $2$ from $28$ to get $\\boxed{26}$ numbers containing the digit $6$ at least twice.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of natural numbers from $1$ to $800$ that contain the digit $6$ at least once.\n## Step 2:  Let's break this down by considering the different cases where the digit $6$ appears in the numbers.\n## Step 3:  First, we'll consider the numbers where $6$ appears in the tens place. We can choose the first digit in $8$ ways, the unit digit in $10$ ways, and the tens place must be $6$, giving us a total of $8 \\cdot 10 = 80$ numbers in this case.\n## Step 4:  Next, we'll consider the numbers where $6$ appears in the unit place. We can choose the first digit in $8$ ways, the tens digit in $9$ ways, and the unit place must be $6$, again giving us a total of $8 \\cdot 9 = 72$ numbers in this case.\n## Step 5:  Lastly, we'll consider the numbers where $6$ appears in the hundreds place. We can choose the first digit in $8$ ways and the tens and unit digits in $9$ and $10$ ways respectively, giving us a total of $8 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 10 = 720$ numbers in this case.\n## Step 6:  However, we've overcounted by including the numbers that contain a $6$ in two places. To correct this, we need to subtract the numbers that contain a $6$ in two places.\n## Step 7:  To calculate the numbers containing a $6$ in two places, we can break it down into three cases: the $6$ appears in the tens and unit places, the $6$ appears in the hundreds and tens places, and the $6$ appears in the hundreds and unit places.\n## Step 8:  For the first case, we can choose the first digit in $8$ ways, and the tens and unit digits must both be $6$, giving us a total of $8$ numbers.\n## Step 9:  For the second case, we can choose the first digit in $8$ ways, and the tens and unit digits can be any of $9 \\cdot 10 = 90$ numbers, giving us a total of $8 \\cdot 90 = 720$ numbers.\n## Step 10:  For the third case, we can choose the first digit in $8$ ways, and the tens and unit digits can be any of $9 \\cdot 10 = 90$ numbers, giving us a total of $8 \\cdot 90 = 720$ numbers.\n## Step 11:  However, we've overcounted again by including the numbers that contain a $6$ in all three places. There are $8$ numbers that contain a $6$ in all three places, so we need to add back these overcounted numbers.\n## Step 12:  By adding up the numbers containing a $6$ in at least two places, we can find the total numbers from $1$ to $800$ that contain a $6$ at least once.\n## Step 13:  Finally, we'll subtract this total from the total numbers from $1$ to $800$ that contain a $6$ at least once to get the numbers that contain the digit $6$ at least twice.\n\n## Step 14:  Therefore, the total numbers from $1$ to $800$ that contain a $6$ at least once is $80 + 72 + 720 = 872$.\n\n## Step 15:  Now, let's find the numbers from $1$ to $800$ that contain the digit $6$ at least twice. We can subtract the total numbers that contain a $6$ in at least two places, which includes the numbers containing a $6$ in two places and the numbers containing a $6$ in all three places, from the total numbers that contain a $6$ at least once.\n\n## Step 16:  So, the numbers from $1$ to $800$ that contain the digit $6$ at least twice is $872 - (8 + 720 + 720) + 8 = 872 - 1448 + 8 = \\boxed{432}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{432}$"
