    "problem": "Each digit in the number 2001 is placed on a different card. In how many ways can three different cards be selected so that the product of the numbers on those cards is not zero?",
    "solution": "There are four cards total, two of which have a zero on them. If three cards are selected, therefore, at least one of them must have a zero on it, making the product of the numbers on those three cards zero. Thus, there are $\\boxed{0}$ ways.",
    "total_tokens": 374,

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are given the number 2001, and we need to select three different cards from these digits such that the product of the numbers on those cards is not zero.\n## Step 2:  This implies that we cannot select the card with the digit 0, as it would make the product zero if it were part of the selection.\n## Step 3:  We have four digits to choose from: 1, 2, 0, and 1. However, we cannot select the digit 0 because it would make the product zero. Therefore, we have three options: 1, 2, and 1.\n## Step 4:  Since we cannot have two cards with the same digit, we have to exclude the scenario where both 1's are selected.\n## Step 5:  To find the number of ways to choose three different cards without the digit 0, we need to consider the scenarios where we have one or two 1's and no 0.\n## Step 6:  If we select one card with the digit 1, there are 2 ways to choose the other two digits, which are 2 and 1.\n## Step 7:  If we select two cards with the digit 1, there are 1 way to choose the third digit, which is 2.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the total number of ways to choose three different cards without the digit 0 is $2 + 1 = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
