    "problem": "How many three-digit positive integers are multiples of 11?",
    "solution": "The first three-digit positive integer that is a multiple of 11 is 110, which is $11\\times 10$.  The last is 990, which is $11\\times 90$.  So, the number of three-digit multiples of 11 is the same as the number of numbers in the list $10, 11, 12, \\ldots, 90$, which is $90-10+1 = \\boxed{81}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the number of three-digit positive integers that are multiples of 11, we need to identify the range of three-digit numbers that are divisible by 11.\n## Step 2:  The smallest three-digit multiple of 11 is $110$ and the largest is $990$. These numbers represent the range of three-digit numbers that we need to consider for our calculation.\n## Step 3:  To find the total count of multiples of 11 within this range, we can calculate the number of multiples of 11 between 110 and 990, inclusive.\n## Step 4:  We start by finding the position of 110 and 990 in the sequence of multiples of 11. The position can be calculated using the formula $\\frac{a}{11}$, where $a$ is the number in question.\n## Step 5:  For 110, the position is $\\frac{110}{11} = 10$, and for 990, the position is $\\frac{990}{11} = 90$.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, we have a total of $90 - 10 + 1 = 81$ multiples of 11 between 110 and 990, inclusive.\n## Step 7:  Hence, there are $\\boxed{81}$ three-digit positive integers that are multiples of 11.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{81}$"
