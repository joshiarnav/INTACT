    "problem": "How many numbers between 1 and 2005 are integer multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12?",
    "solution": "Since $\\frac{2005}{3} = 668\\frac13$, there are 668 multiples of 3 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\\frac{2005}{4} = 501\\frac14$, there are 501 multiples of 4 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\\frac{2005}{12} = 167\\frac{1}{12}$, there are 167 multiples of 12 between 1 and 2005.\n\nEvery multiple of 12 is also a multiple of 3 and of 4, so there are $668-167 = 501$ multiples of 3 that are not multiples of 12 and $501-167 = 334$ multiples of 4 that are not multiples of 12.  That leaves $501 + 334 = \\boxed{835}$ numbers that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12.  (Note: no number can be a multiple of 3 and 4 without also being a multiple of 12.  So, no number is included twice in our count $501+334$.)",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step as you suggested.\n\n**1. Understand what we're given and what we need to find:**\n\nWe are looking for numbers between 1 and 2005 that are integer multiples of 3 or 4, but not 12. In other words, we want to count the numbers that are divisible by either 3 or 4, but exclude any numbers that are also divisible by 12.\n\n**2. Identify key concepts and formulas:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll need to use the following concepts:\n\n* The principle of inclusion-exclusion, which states that the number of elements in a union of two sets can be found by adding the number of elements in each set and then subtracting the number of elements in their intersection.\n* The fact that if a number is divisible by both 3 and 4, it is also divisible by 12 (since 12 is the least common multiple of 3 and 4).\n\n**3. Solve the problem step by step:**\n\nLet's break down the problem into smaller parts:\n\n**Part 1: Count the numbers that are multiples of 3**\n\n* The largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 2005 is 2004.\n* We can find the number of multiples of 3 between 1 and 2005 by dividing 2004 by 3 and rounding down to the nearest integer: floor(2004/3) = 668.\n\n**Part 2: Count the numbers that are multiples of 4**\n\n* The largest multiple of 4 that is less than or equal to 2005 is 2004.\n* We can find the number of multiples of 4 between 1 and 2005 by dividing 2004 by 4 and rounding down to the nearest integer: floor(2004/4) = 501.\n\n**Part 3: Count the numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 4 (i.e., multiples of 12)**\n\n* The largest multiple of 12 that is less than or equal to 2005 is 2004.\n* We can find the number of multiples of 12 between 1 and 2005 by dividing 2004 by 12 and rounding down to the nearest integer: floor(2004/12) = 167.\n\n**Part 4: Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion**\n\n* The total number of multiples of 3 or 4 is the sum of the number of multiples of 3 and the number of multiples of 4, minus the number of multiples of both 3 and 4 (i.e., multiples of 12): 668 + 501 - 167 = 1002.\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the numbers that are multiples of 12. Since we've already counted these numbers in Part 3, we can simply subtract the count of multiples of 12 from the total: 1002 - 167 = 835.\n\n**4. Verify our answer and express it in the required format:**\n\nWe've solved the problem step by step, and our answer is 835. We can verify this answer by checking if it is reasonable and if it satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 835."
