    "problem": "A Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans.  In how many distinguishable ways can they sit around a circular table if all the members of each party all sit next to each other?  (If the table is rotated, it should be counted as the same seating.)",
    "solution": "Choose any 5 consecutive seats in which to place the Democrats -- it doesn't matter which 5 consecutive seats that we choose, since we can rotate the table.  Then there are $5!$ ways to place the Democrats in their seats, and $5!$ ways to place the Republicans in their seats, for a total of $5! \\times 5! = \\boxed{14,\\!400}$ arrangements.",

    "model_solution": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**1. Understand the problem and what we need to find**\n\nWe have a Senate committee with 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans. We need to find the number of distinguishable ways they can sit around a circular table, assuming all members of each party sit next to each other.\n\n**2. Identify key concepts and formulas**\n\nSince the table is circular, we need to consider the concept of circular permutations. However, we also need to account for the fact that all members of each party sit together. This means we can treat each party as a single unit.\n\nWe can use the formula for permutations of a circular object, which is (n-1)!, where n is the number of objects. However, we also need to consider the permutations within each party.\n\n**3. Solve the problem step by step**\n\n**Step 1: Treat each party as a single unit**\n\nWe have two parties, so we can treat each party as a single unit. This means we have 2 units to arrange around the circular table. We can use the formula for circular permutations to find the number of ways to arrange these 2 units: (2-1)! = 1.\n\nHowever, within each party, the members can be arranged in different orders. For the 5 Democrats, there are 5! ways to arrange them. Similarly, for the 5 Republicans, there are 5! ways to arrange them.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of distinguishable ways**\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways to arrange the two parties by the number of ways to arrange each party internally.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the two parties is 1 (from step 1).\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the Democrats is 5! = 120.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the Republicans is 5! = 120.\n\nSo, the total number of distinguishable ways is:\n\n1 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 120 = 14400\n\n**4. Verify the answer and express it in the required format**\n\nOur answer seems reasonable. We have 10 people, and we're arranging them in a circular manner with some restrictions. The final answer is indeed a large number, which makes sense given the number of possible arrangements.\n\nThe final answer is: $14400$"
