    "problem": "If Michael rolls three fair dice, what is the probability that he will roll at least two 1's? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We calculate the complement, or the probability that Michael does not roll at least two 1's, and then subtract from 1.  If Michael does not roll at least two 1's, he must roll either zero or one.  The probability that he rolls no 1's is  $$\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6} = \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{216}$$The probability that he rolls one 1 is $$\\left(\\binom{3}{1}\\cdot\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\\cdot\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{6} = \\binom{3}{1}\\left(\\frac{25}{216}\\right) = \\frac{75}{216},$$since we can choose which of the dice rolled a 1 in $\\binom{3}{1}$ ways.  Thus our answer is $1-\\frac{125}{216}-\\frac{75}{216} = \\frac{16}{216}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{27}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find**\n\nWe are given that Michael rolls three fair dice. We need to find the probability that he will roll at least two 1's.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need**\n\nSince we are dealing with a probability problem involving dice, we need to consider the following:\n\n* The probability of getting a 1 on a single die is 1/6.\n* The probability of getting a non-1 (i.e. 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) on a single die is 5/6.\n* We need to consider all possible outcomes when rolling three dice, which is a total of 6^3 = 216 possible outcomes.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step**\n\nTo find the probability of rolling at least two 1's, we can use the complement rule: P(at least two 1's) = 1 - P(fewer than two 1's).\n\nLet's calculate the probability of fewer than two 1's:\n\n**Case 1: No 1's**\n\nThe probability of not rolling a 1 on a single die is 5/6. Since there are three dice, the probability of not rolling a 1 on any of them is (5/6)^3 = 125/216.\n\n**Case 2: Exactly one 1**\n\nThe probability of rolling a 1 on one specific die is 1/6, and the probability of not rolling a 1 on the other two dice is (5/6)^2 = 25/36. Since there are three possible dice that could roll the 1, we multiply this probability by 3 to account for all possible cases: 3 \\* (1/6) \\* (25/36) = 25/72.\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of these two cases to get the total probability of fewer than two 1's:\n\nP(fewer than two 1's) = 125/216 + 25/72 = (125 \\* 3 + 25) / 216 = 400/216.\n\n**Step 4: Find the probability of at least two 1's**\n\nUsing the complement rule, we can now find the probability of at least two 1's:\n\nP(at least two 1's) = 1 - P(fewer than two 1's) = 1 - 400/216 = 816/216 = 41/27/6.\n\nWait, that's not a fraction... \n\nLet's simplify the fraction:\n\n816/216 = 2/3.\n\nHowever, there is another way to approach this problem using combinations.\n\nDo you want me to show both solutions?"
