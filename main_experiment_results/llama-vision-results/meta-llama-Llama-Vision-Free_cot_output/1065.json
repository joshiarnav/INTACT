    "problem": "The dartboard below has a radius of 6 inches. Each of the concentric circles has a radius two inches less than the next larger circle.

    "solution": "The probability for a single dart to land in the non-shaded region is the ratio of the area of the non-shaded region to the area of the entire dartboard. The area of the entire dartboard is $\\pi \\cdot 6^2 = 36\\pi$. The area of the shaded region is the area of the second largest circle minus the area of the smallest circle, or $\\pi \\cdot 4^2 - \\pi \\cdot 2^2 = 12 \\pi$, so the area of the non-shaded region is $36\\pi - 12\\pi = 24\\pi$. Thus, our ratio is $\\frac{24\\pi}{36\\pi}=\\frac{2}{3}$. If each dart has a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance of landing in a non-shaded region and there are 9 darts, then the expected number of darts that land in a non-shaded region is $9 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\boxed{6}$.",

    "model_solution": "It seems like you've laid out a clear plan for solving the problem! Let's go through each step together:\n\n**1. Understand what we're given and what we need to find:**\n\nWe're given a dartboard with three concentric circles, each with a radius that is two inches less than the next larger circle. The outermost circle has a radius of 6 inches. We need to find out how many darts, out of nine that land randomly on the target, we would expect to land in a non-shaded region.\n\n**2. Identify key concepts and formulas:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll need to understand the areas of the different regions of the dartboard. The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.\n\n**3. Solve the problem step by step:**\n\nLet's calculate the areas of the different regions:\n\n* The area of the shaded region (the small circle) is $A_1 = \\pi(4^2) = 16\\pi$.\n* The area of the non-shaded region (the annulus) is $A_2 = \\pi(6^2) - \\pi(4^2) = 36\\pi - 16\\pi = 20\\pi$.\n* Since we're interested in the non-shaded region, we'll focus on $A_2$.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many darts we would expect to land in the non-shaded region. Since the nine darts are randomly distributed, we can assume that the probability of a dart landing in the non-shaded region is proportional to the area of the non-shaded region.\n\n**4. Calculate the expected number of darts in the non-shaded region:**\n\nLet's calculate the ratio of the area of the non-shaded region to the total area of the dartboard:\n\n$\\frac{A_2}{A_1+A_2} = \\frac{20\\pi}{16\\pi + 20\\pi} = \\frac{20\\pi}{36\\pi} = \\frac{5}{9}$\n\nSince the ratio of the areas is $\\frac{5}{9}$, we would expect $\\frac{5}{9}$ of the total number of darts to land in the non-shaded region.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected number of darts in the non-shaded region:\n\n$\\frac{5}{9} \\cdot 9 = 5$\n\nTherefore, we would expect 5 darts to land in the non-shaded region.\n\n**5. Verify our answer and express it in the required format:**\n\nWe've solved the problem step by step, and we're confident that our answer is correct. Now, let's express our answer in the required format.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
