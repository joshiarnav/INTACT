    "problem": "I draw a card from a standard 52-card deck.  If I draw an Ace, I win 1 dollar.  If I draw a 2 through 10, I win a number of dollars equal to the value of the card.  If I draw a face card (Jack, Queen, or King), I win 20 dollars.  If I draw a $\\clubsuit$, my winnings are doubled, and if I draw a $\\spadesuit$, my winnings are tripled.

    "solution": "Let $E_1$ be the expected winnings if a $\\heartsuit$ or $\\diamondsuit$ is drawn.  Since the probability that any particular rank is drawn is the same for any rank, the expected value is simply the average all the winnings for each rank, so \\[ E_1 = \\frac{1}{13}(\\$1+\\$2+\\cdots+\\$10+(3\\times\\$20)) = \\$\\frac{115}{13}. \\]Let $E_2$ be the expected winnings if a $\\clubsuit$ is drawn and $E_3$ the expected winnings if a $\\spadesuit$ is drawn.  Since drawing a $\\clubsuit$ doubles the winnings and drawing a $\\spadesuit$ triples the winnings, $E_2 = 2E_1$ and $E_3 = 3E_1$.  Since there is an equal chance drawing each of the suits, we can average their expected winnings to find the overall expected winnings.  Therefore the expected winnings are \\[ E = \\frac{1}{4}(E_1 + E_1 + E_2 + E_3) = \\frac{1}{4}(7E_1) = {\\$\\frac{805}{52}}, \\]or about $\\boxed{\\$15.48}$, which is the fair price to pay to play the game.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find**\n\nWe need to find the fair price to pay to play a game where we draw a card from a standard 52-card deck. The winnings depend on the value of the card and the suit of the card. We need to calculate the expected value of playing the game and express it as a dollar value rounded to the nearest cent.\n\n**Step 2: Identify key concepts and formulas**\n\nThe key concepts in this problem are:\n\n* Probability: We need to calculate the probability of drawing each type of card.\n* Expected value: We need to calculate the expected value of playing the game, which is the sum of the products of each possible outcome and its probability.\n* Suit effects: We need to account for the effects of drawing a card of a specific suit (clubs or spades) on the winnings.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the expected value**\n\nLet's calculate the expected value of playing the game:\n\n* Probability of drawing an Ace: 4/52 (since there are 4 Aces in a deck of 52 cards) = 1/13\n* Probability of drawing a 2 through 10: 36/52 (since there are 36 cards with values 2-10 in a deck of 52 cards) = 9/13\n* Probability of drawing a face card: 12/52 (since there are 12 face cards in a deck of 52 cards) = 3/13\n* Probability of drawing a club: 13/52 (since there are 13 clubs in a deck of 52 cards)\n* Probability of drawing a spade: 13/52 (since there are 13 spades in a deck of 52 cards)\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected value:\n\n* Expected value of drawing an Ace: (1/13) \u00d7 1 = 1/13\n* Expected value of drawing a 2 through 10: (9/13) \u00d7 (2+3+...+10) = (9/13) \u00d7 54 = 486/13\n* Expected value of drawing a face card: (3/13) \u00d7 20 = 60/13\n* Expected value of drawing a club: (13/52) \u00d7 (winnings \u00d7 2) = (13/52) \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 value of card)\n* Expected value of drawing a spade: (13/52) \u00d7 (winnings \u00d7 3) = (13/52) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 value of card)\n\nWe need to calculate the value of the expected winnings for each type of card. Let's denote the value of the expected winnings as E.\n\nFor the Ace, 2 through 10, and face card, the expected winnings are:\n\n* E = (1/13) \u00d7 1 + (9/13) \u00d7 54/9 + (3/13) \u00d7 20 = 1 + 54 + 60/13 = 61.46\n\nFor the club and spade, the expected winnings are:\n\n* E = (13/52) \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 value of card) + (13/52) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 value of card) = (13/52) \u00d7 (2 + 3) \u00d7 value of card = (13/52) \u00d7 5 \u00d7 value of card\n\nWe need to calculate the value of the card, which depends on the suit. Let's denote the value of the card as V.\n\nFor the club, the expected winnings are:\n\n* E = (13/52) \u00d7 5 \u00d7 V \u00d7 2 = (13/52) \u00d7 10 \u00d7 V\n\nFor the spade, the expected winnings are:\n\n* E = (13/52) \u00d7 5 \u00d7 V \u00d7 3 = (13/52) \u00d7 15 \u00d7 V\n\n**Step 4: Combine the expected values**\n\nNow, let's combine the expected values:\n\n* E = 61.46 + (13/52) \u00d7 10 \u00d7 V + (13/52) \u00d7 15 \u00d7 V = 61.46 + (13/52) \u00d7 (10 + 15) \u00d7 V = 61.46 + (13/52) \u00d7 25 \u00d7 V\n\nWe need to find the value of V, which represents the value of the card. We can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 52/13:\n\n* 52E/13 = 52 \u00d7 61.46 + 25V\n* 4E = 3193.12 + 25V\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of E and V:\n\n* 4 \u00d7 61.46 = 245.84\n* 245.84 = 3193.12 + 25V\n* 25V = 3947.28\n* V = 157.871\n\nHowever, V represents the value of the card, which is an integer between 1 and 10. We made an error in our calculation.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem:\n\nThe expected value of drawing a club is:\n\n* (13/52) \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 value of card) = (1/4) \u00d7 2 \u00d7 value of card = 0.5 \u00d7 value of card\n\nThe expected value of drawing a spade is:\n\n* (13/52) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 value of card) = (1/4) \u00d7 3 \u00d7 value of card = 0.75 \u00d7 value of card\n\nWe can simplify the expected value calculation:\n\n* E = 0.5 \u00d7 value of card \u00d7 (0.5 + 0.75)\n* E = 1.25 \u00d7 value of card \u00d7 (1/4)\n* E = 0.3125 \u00d7 value of card\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected value:\n\n* E = (1/13) \u00d7 1 + (9/13) \u00d7 54/9 + (3/13) \u00d7 20 + 0.3125 \u00d7 value of card\n* E = 1 + 6 + 4.61538 + 0.3125 \u00d7 value of card\n* E = 11.61538 + 0.3125 \u00d7 value of card\n\nWe can calculate the expected value for each type of card:\n\n* Expected value of drawing an Ace: 1\n* Expected value of drawing a 2 through 10: 6\n* Expected value of drawing a face card: 4.61538\n* Expected value of drawing a club or spade: 11.61538 + 0.3125 \u00d7 value of card\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected value of playing the game:\n\n* E = (1/13) \u00d7 1 + (9/13) \u00d7 6 + (3/13) \u00d7 4.61538 + (1/13) \u00d7 (11.61538 + 0.3125 \u00d7 value of card) + (1/13) \u00d7 (11.61538 + 0.3125 \u00d7 value of card)\n* E = 1/13 + 54/13 + 13.84514/13 + 2 \u00d7 (11.61538 + 0.3125 \u00d7 value of card)/13\n* E = 1/13 + 54/13 + 13.84514/13 + 2 \u00d7 11.61538/13 + 2 \u00d7 0.3125 \u00d7 value of card/13\n* E = 1/13 + 54/13 + 13.84514/13 + 23.23076/13 + 0.625 \u00d7 value of card/13\n\nNow, let's simplify the expected value calculation:\n\n* E = 1/13 + 54/13 + 13.84514/13 + 23.23076/13 + 0.625 \u00d7 value of card/13\n* E = (1 + 54 + 13.84514 + 23.23076)/13 + 0.625 \u00d7 value of card/13\n* E = 92.0759/13 + 0.625 \u00d7 value of card/13\n* E = 7.0734 + 0.0488 \u00d7 value of card\n\nWe can calculate the value of the expected winnings for each type of card:\n\n* E = 7.0734 + 0.0488 \u00d7 value of card\n\nNow, let's find the expected value of playing the game:\n\n* E = (1/13) \u00d7 (7.0734 + 0.0488 \u00d7 value of card) \u00d7 4 + (9/13) \u00d7 (7.0734 + 0.0488 \u00d7 2) + (3/13) \u00d7 (7.0734 + 0.0488 \u00d7 20)\n* E = (4/13) \u00d7 7.0734 + (4/13) \u00d7 0.0488 \u00d7 value of card + (9/13) \u00d7 7.0734 + (9/13) \u00d7 0.0488 \u00d7 2 + (3/13) \u00d7 7.0734 + (3/13) \u00d7 0.0488 \u00d7 20\n* E = (4/13) \u00d7 7.0734 + (9/13) \u00d7 7.0734 + (3/13) \u00d7 7.0734 + 0.0488 \u00d7 value of card \u00d7 (4/13 + 18/13 + 60/13)\n* E = (4 + 9 + 3)/13 \u00d7 7.0734 + 0.0488 \u00d7 value of card \u00d7 82/13\n* E = 16/13 \u00d7 7.0734 + 0.0488 \u00d7 value of card \u00d7 82/13\n* E = 113.0888/13 + 0.0488 \u00d7 value of card \u00d7 82/13\n* E = 8.7007 + 0.3848 \u00d7 value of card\n\nWe can calculate the expected value of playing the game for each type of card:\n\n* Expected value of drawing an Ace: 8.7007\n* Expected value of drawing a 2 through 10: 8.7007 + 0.3848 \u00d7 2 = 8.7007 + 0.7696 = 9.4703\n* Expected value of drawing a face card: 8.7007 + 0.3848 \u00d7 20 = 8.7007 + 7.696 = 16.3967\n* Expected value of drawing a club or spade: 8.7007 + 0.3848 \u00d7 value of card\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected value of playing the game:\n\n* E = (1/13) \u00d7 8.7007 + (9/13) \u00d7 9.4703 + (3/13) \u00d7 16.3967 + (1/13) \u00d7 (8.7007 + 0.3848 \u00d7 value of card) + (1/13) \u00d7 (8.7007 + 0.3848 \u00d7 value of card)\n* E = 8.7007/13 + 85.1237/13 + 49.1901/13 + 2 \u00d7 (8.7007 + 0.3848 \u00d7 value of card)/13\n* E = 8.7007/13 + 85.1237/13 + 49.1901/13 + 2 \u00d7 8.7007/13 + 2 \u00d7 0.3848 \u00d7 value of card/13\n* E = 8.7007/13 + 85.1237/13 + 49.1901/13 + 2 \u00d7 8.7007/13 + 2 \u00d7 0.3848 \u00d7 value of card/13\n\nNow, let's simplify the expected value calculation:\n\n* E = 8.7007/13 + 85.1237/13 + 49.1901/13 + 2 \u00d7 8.7007/13 + 2 \u00d7 0.3848 \u00d7 value of card/13\n* E = (8.7007 + 85.1237 + 49.1901 + 2 \u00d7 8.7007)/13 + 2 \u00d7 0.3848 \u00d7 value of card/13\n* E = (151.7151)/13 + 2 \u00d7 0.3848 \u00d7 value of card/13\n* E = 11.6842 + 0.7696 \u00d7 value of card\n\nWe can calculate the expected value of playing the game:\n\n* E = 11.6842 + 0.7696 \u00d7 value of card\n\nNow, let's find the fair price to pay to play the game:\n\n* Fair price = -E\n* Fair price = -11.6842 - 0.7696 \u00d7 value of card\n\nWe can calculate the fair price to pay to play the game:\n\n* Fair price = -11.6842 - 0.7696 \u00d7 value of card\n\nNow, let's round the fair price to the nearest cent:\n\n* Fair price \u2248 -11.68\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-11.68}$"
