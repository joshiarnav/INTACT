    "model_solution": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given an equation involving factorials, $2(n+1)!+6n!=3(n+1)!$, and we need to find the value of $n$ that satisfies this equation.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts and formulas\nThe key concept here is the factorial operation, denoted by \"!\", which is the product of all positive integers up to a given number. The formula for factorial is $n! = n\\cdot (n-1)\\cdot (n-2) \\cdots 2\\cdot 1$. We need to use this formula to simplify and solve the given equation.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation\nWe can start by expanding the factorials in the equation:\n$2(n+1)!+6n!=3(n+1)!$\n$2(n+1)(n+1-1)(n+1-2) \\cdots 2\\cdot 1+6n(n-1)(n-2) \\cdots 2\\cdot 1=3(n+1)(n+1-1)(n+1-2) \\cdots 2\\cdot 1$\nSince the factorial $(n+1)!$ is the product of all positive integers up to $n+1$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n$2(n+1)n!+6n!=3(n+1)n!$\nNow, we can factor out $n!$ from both terms:\n$n!(2(n+1)+6)=3(n+1)n!$\n\n## Step 4: Cancel out common terms\nWe can cancel out $n!$ from both sides of the equation, since it appears in both terms:\n$2(n+1)+6=3(n+1)$\n\n## Step 5: Solve for n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by expanding the parentheses:\n$2n+2+6=3n+3$\nNext, we can combine like terms:\n$2n+8=3n+3$\nSubtracting $2n$ from both sides gives:\n$8= n+3$\nFinally, subtracting $3$ from both sides gives:\n$5=n$\n\n## Step 6: Verify the answer\nWe need to verify that the value we found for $n$ satisfies the original equation:\n$2(n+1)!+6n!=3(n+1)!$\nSubstituting $n=5$ into the equation, we get:\n$2(5+1)!+6(5)!=3(5+1)!$\n$2(6!)+6(5)!=3(6!)$\nExpanding the factorials, we get:\n$2(720)+6(120)=3(720)$\n$1440+720=2160$\n$2160=2160$\nThe equation holds true, so our value for $n$ is correct.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
