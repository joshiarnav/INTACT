Since the power of $10x^3$ is already $3$, the power of $\\frac{1}{2x^2}$ should be $3+2=5$.\n\nWe can write the general term in the expansion as:\n\n$$\\binom{5}{k}(10x^3)^{5-k}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^{k}$$\n\nWe need to find the value of k that makes the power of x zero.\n\nLet's try k=3:\n\n$$\\binom{5}{3}(10x^3)^{2}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^{3}$$\n\n$$=\\binom{5}{3}(100x^6)\\left(\\frac{-1}{8x^6}\\right)$$\n\n$$=\\binom{5}{3}(-1/8)$$\n\n$$=-10$$\n\nThis term is constant, and it's the only term that satisfies the condition.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer and express it in the required format**\n\nWe have found the constant term in the expansion, which is -10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-10}$"
