    "model_solution": "Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the problem and what needs to be found.\nWe are given a pentagonal prism, a three-dimensional shape with two identical pentagonal bases connected by a rectangular lateral face. A diagonal is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices. We need to find the number of diagonals in this pentagonal prism.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts and formulas.\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of a pentagonal prism and how to count the diagonals. We will count the diagonals on each face and then subtract the ones that are not diagonals.\n\n## Step 3: Count the number of diagonals on each face.\nEach pentagonal face has 5 vertices, and each vertex is connected to 4 other vertices. However, 2 of these connections are edges, not diagonals. Therefore, each vertex has 3 diagonals, and since there are 5 vertices, there are 5 x 3 = 15 diagonals on each pentagonal face. Since there are 2 pentagonal faces, there are a total of 2 x 15 = 30 diagonals on the pentagonal faces.\n\n## Step 4: Count the number of diagonals on the rectangular faces.\nEach rectangular face has 4 vertices, and each vertex is connected to 2 other vertices. However, 2 of these connections are edges, not diagonals. Therefore, each vertex has 2 diagonals, and since there are 4 vertices on each rectangular face and 3 rectangular faces, there are 4 x 2 x 3 = 24 diagonals on the rectangular faces.\n\n## Step 5: Subtract the overlapping diagonals.\nWhen counting the total number of diagonals, we counted some diagonals twice. Each diagonal on the pentagonal faces intersects with 2 rectangular faces, and each diagonal on the rectangular faces intersects with 2 pentagonal faces. However, we should only count each diagonal once. Since there are 30 diagonals on the pentagonal faces and 24 diagonals on the rectangular faces, and each diagonal is counted twice, we need to subtract the overlapping diagonals.\n\n## Step 6: Find the total number of diagonals.\nSince there are 30 diagonals on the pentagonal faces and 24 diagonals on the rectangular faces, and the diagonals on the pentagonal faces intersect with the diagonals on the rectangular faces, we can find the total number of diagonals by adding the diagonals on the pentagonal faces and the rectangular faces and then subtracting the overlapping diagonals.\n\nHowever, we realize that each diagonal is actually counted 4 times (once for each vertex it connects). So the formula should be:\n\nTotal diagonals = (number of diagonals on pentagonal faces) + (number of diagonals on rectangular faces) - (overlapping diagonals)\n= (5 * 3 * 2) + (4 * 2 * 3) - (5 * 4 * 2 / 2)\n= 30 + 24 - 20\n= 34\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{34}$"
