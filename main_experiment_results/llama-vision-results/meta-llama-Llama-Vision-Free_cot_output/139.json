    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We need to determine the number of paths from point $A$ to point $B$ on the grid, with the restriction that every step must be either up or to the right.\n## Step 2:  First, let's understand the grid layout and the movement restrictions. We can move either up or to the right, and the path must end at point $B$.\n## Step 3:  To solve this, we can consider the path as a sequence of steps. Since we need to move 3 units up and 5 units to the right to reach point $B$ from $A$, we can think of the path as a sequence of 3 up-steps and 5 right-steps.\n## Step 4:  We need to find the number of ways to arrange these steps in a valid path. This can be represented as a combination problem, where we choose 3 out of the total 8 steps to be up-steps.\n## Step 5:  The formula for combinations is given by $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $k$ is the number of items to choose.\n## Step 6:  In this case, we have 8 total steps, and we want to choose 3 of them to be up-steps. So, we can use the combination formula to find the number of valid paths.\n## Step 7:  Applying the formula, we get $\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3! \\cdot 5!} = \\frac{8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 56$.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{56}$ paths from $A$ to $B$ on the grid, with every step being up or to the right.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{56}$"
