    "model_solution": "It seems like you want to outline a general approach to solving a problem step by step. I'll adapt this to the specific problem of counting rectangles in the given figure.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the problem and what we're looking for\nWe need to count the number of different rectangles in the given figure. A rectangle is defined by two horizontal segments and two vertical segments. We can count the rectangles by considering the different ways these segments can be chosen.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts and formulas\nTo count the rectangles, we can consider the following:\n- The horizontal segments can be chosen in 4 ways (the top, middle, bottom, or any two of the horizontal lines).\n- The vertical segments can be chosen in 3 ways (the left, middle, or right vertical line).\n- We need to consider all possible combinations of horizontal and vertical segments.\n\n## Step 3: Count the number of rectangles\nLet's count the rectangles by considering the different ways the horizontal and vertical segments can be chosen.\n- There are 4 ways to choose the horizontal segments (top, middle, bottom, or any two of the horizontal lines).\n- There are 3 ways to choose the vertical segments (left, middle, or right vertical line).\n- However, we can't simply multiply these numbers, as some rectangles will be counted multiple times.\n- For example, if we choose the top and bottom horizontal segments, the left and right vertical segments form a rectangle that is also formed by choosing the middle horizontal segment and the left or right vertical segment.\n- We need to consider the different ways the vertical segments can be chosen when only two horizontal segments are chosen.\n- When only two horizontal segments are chosen, there are 2 ways to choose the vertical segments (left and right).\n\n## Step 4: Count rectangles formed by two horizontal segments\nWhen two horizontal segments are chosen, there are 2 ways to choose the vertical segments (left and right vertical line).\nSo, there are $2 \\times 1 = 2$ rectangles formed by two horizontal segments.\n\n## Step 5: Count rectangles formed by three horizontal segments\nWhen three horizontal segments are chosen, there is 1 way to choose the vertical segment (the middle vertical line).\nSo, there are $1 \\times 1 = 1$ rectangle formed by three horizontal segments.\n\n## Step 6: Count rectangles formed by four horizontal segments\nWhen four horizontal segments are chosen, there are 3 ways to choose the vertical segments (left, middle, or right vertical line).\nSo, there are $1 \\times 3 = 3$ rectangles formed by four horizontal segments.\n\n## Step 7: Count rectangles formed by one horizontal and one vertical segment\nThere are 4 ways to choose one horizontal segment and 3 ways to choose one vertical segment.\nHowever, each of these combinations forms a rectangle that has been counted multiple times already.\nSo, we need to subtract these rectangles from the total count.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total number of rectangles\nWe can calculate the total number of rectangles by adding the counts from steps 4, 5, and 6, and then subtracting the count from step 7.\nSo, the total number of rectangles is $2 + 1 + 3 = 6$.\n\n## Step 9: Verify our answer\nThe total number of rectangles is $6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
