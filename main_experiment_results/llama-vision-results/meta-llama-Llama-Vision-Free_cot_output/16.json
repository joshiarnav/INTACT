    "problem": "The letters $A, B$ and $C$ are used to form every possible three letter ``word.'' When these ``words'' are arranged in alphabetical order and numbered so that $AAA$ is Word 1 and $CCC$ is Word 27, what number will correspond to the position of word $BAB$ on the list?",
    "solution": "There are 9 possible words that start with A to begin the list, so the first word starting with B, BAA, is the 10th word. BAB is the next word after BAA, or word number $\\boxed{11}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find.**\n\nWe are given three letters $A, B,$ and $C$ that are used to form every possible three-letter \"word.\" These words are arranged in alphabetical order and numbered from 1 to 27, with $AAA$ being Word 1 and $CCC$ being Word 27. We need to find the position of the word $BAB$ on this list.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need.**\n\nWe can use the concept of permutations to solve this problem. Since there are three letters and each letter can be used any number of times, we have 3 choices for the first letter, 3 choices for the second letter, and 3 choices for the third letter. This gives us a total of $3^3 = 27$ possible three-letter words.\n\nWe can also use the concept of combinatorics to find the position of the word $BAB$. We know that $BAB$ starts with $B$, then $A$, and finally $B$. We need to find the number of words that come before $BAB$ that start with $B$.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step.**\n\nLet's count the number of words that come before $BAB$ that start with $B$.\n\nThere are 3 choices for the first letter, which is $B$. For the second letter, there are 2 choices, which are $A$ and $C$ (since we don't want $BAB$ itself). For the third letter, there are 2 choices, which are $A$ and $C$ (since we don't want $BAB$ itself).\n\nSo, the number of words that come before $BAB$ that start with $B$ is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\nNow, we need to add 1 to this number, since $BAB$ itself is also a word that starts with $B$. Therefore, the total number of words that come before $BAB$ is $4 + 1 = 5$.\n\nSince $BAB$ is the 6th word that starts with $B$, we need to add the number of words that come before $BAB$ that start with $A$ and $C$. There are $3 \\times 3 = 9$ such words.\n\nTherefore, the total number of words that come before $BAB$ is $5 + 9 = 14$.\n\nSince $AAA$ is Word 1, the position of $BAB$ is $14 + 1 = 15$.\n\n**Step 4: Verify our answer and express it in the required format.**\n\nOur answer is $\\boxed{15}.$"
