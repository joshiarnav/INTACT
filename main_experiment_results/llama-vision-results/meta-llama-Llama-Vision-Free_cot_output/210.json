    "problem": "In a math class of 30 students, 12 out of 15 girls are freshmen and 11 out of 15 boys are freshmen.

    "solution": "We can choose 2 freshmen girls and 3 freshman boys in $\\binom{12}{2}\\binom{11}{3} = 10890$ ways.  There are a total of $\\binom{30}{5} = 142506$ possible groups of 5 students we can choose.  Thus the probability of selecting a group of 5 students with 2 freshman girls and 3 freshmen boys is $\\frac{10890}{142506} \\approx \\boxed{0.076}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n**1. Understanding what we're given and what we need to find:**\n\nWe have a class of 30 students, consisting of 15 girls and 15 boys. Out of the girls, 12 are freshmen, and out of the boys, 11 are freshmen. We need to find the probability of selecting a group of 5 students, consisting of 2 freshmen girls and 3 freshmen boys.\n\n**2. Identifying the key concepts and formulas we need:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll need to use the concept of combinations (choosing a group of students from a larger group without regard to order) and the formula for probability. The formula for probability is:\n\nP(event) = (number of favorable outcomes) / (total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is selecting 2 freshmen girls and 3 freshmen boys, and the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of ways to select 5 students from the class.\n\n**3. Solving the problem step by step:**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of ways to select 2 freshmen girls from the 12 girls who are freshmen. This can be done using combinations:\n\nC(12, 2) = (12!)/(2!(12-2)!) = (12!)/(2!10!) = (12*11)/(2) = 66\n\nSimilarly, let's calculate the number of ways to select 3 freshmen boys from the 11 boys who are freshmen:\n\nC(11, 3) = (11!)/(3!(11-3)!) = (11!)/(3!8!) = (11*10*9)/(3*2) = 165\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of ways to select 5 students from the class, regardless of their freshmen status. This is also a combination:\n\nC(30, 5) = (30!)/(5!(30-5)!) = (30!)/(5!25!) = (30*29*28*27*26)/(5*4*3*2) = 142,506\n\nNow, we can find the number of ways to select 2 freshmen girls and 3 freshmen boys by multiplying the number of ways to select 2 freshmen girls by the number of ways to select 3 freshmen boys:\n\n66 * 165 = 10,890\n\nNow, we can find the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nP(event) = 10,890 / 142,506 \u2248 0.076\n\n**4. Verifying our answer and expressing it in the required format:**\n\nLet's verify our answer by checking that it's a valid probability (between 0 and 1). Our answer is approximately 0.076, which is within the valid range.\n\nFinally, we can express our answer in the required format: a decimal to the nearest thousandth."
