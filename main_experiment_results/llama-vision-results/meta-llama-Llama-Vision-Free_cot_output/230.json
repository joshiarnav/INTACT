    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nTo start solving the problem, we need to understand what's being asked. We have a grid of 9 points, and we choose a set of 3 points randomly from this grid. Each set of 3 points has the same probability of being chosen. We want to find the probability that these 3 points lie on the same straight line.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas\nSince we are dealing with a grid and selecting points, the key concept here is combinations. However, to determine the probability of the points lying on the same straight line, we need to consider the total number of ways to choose 3 points from the grid and the number of sets of 3 points that lie on the same line.\n\n## Step 3: Count the total number of ways to choose 3 points from the grid\nThere are 9 points in the grid, and we need to choose 3 of them. This can be calculated using the combination formula, which is given by nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of points and r is the number of points to be chosen. So, the total number of ways to choose 3 points from the grid is 9C3.\n\n## Step 4: Count the number of sets of 3 points that lie on the same line\nThere are sets of points that lie on the same line: the horizontal lines, the vertical lines, and the diagonal lines. We need to count the number of sets of 3 points on each type of line.\n\n## Step 5: Count the sets of 3 points on horizontal lines\nThere are 3 horizontal lines, and on each line, there are 3 points. Therefore, there are 3 sets of 3 points on the horizontal lines.\n\n## Step 6: Count the sets of 3 points on vertical lines\nSimilarly, there are 3 vertical lines, and on each line, there are 3 points. Therefore, there are 3 sets of 3 points on the vertical lines.\n\n## Step 7: Count the sets of 3 points on diagonal lines\nThere are 2 diagonal lines. On each diagonal line, there are 3 points. Therefore, there are 2 sets of 3 points on the diagonal lines.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total number of sets of 3 points that lie on the same line\nWe have 3 sets of 3 points on the horizontal lines, 3 sets of 3 points on the vertical lines, and 2 sets of 3 points on the diagonal lines. Therefore, the total number of sets of 3 points that lie on the same line is 3 + 3 + 2.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate 9C3\nUsing the combination formula, we can calculate 9C3 as 9! / (3!(9-3)!) = 84.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the probability\nThe probability that the 3 points lie on the same line is the total number of sets of 3 points that lie on the same line divided by the total number of ways to choose 3 points from the grid.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the probability\nThe total number of sets of 3 points that lie on the same line is 3 + 3 + 2 = 8. The total number of ways to choose 3 points from the grid is 84. Therefore, the probability that the 3 points lie on the same line is 8/84.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the fraction\nThe fraction 8/84 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4. Simplifying the fraction, we get 2/21.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{21}}$"
