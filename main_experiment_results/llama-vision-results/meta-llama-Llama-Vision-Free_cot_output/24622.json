    "problem": "The positive five-digit integers that use each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 exactly once are ordered from least to greatest. What is the $50^{\\text{th}}$ integer in the list?",
    "solution": "We start with the numbers that start with 1.  There are 4 ways to pick the next digit, then 3 ways to pick the third digit, 2 ways to pick the fourth, and 1 to pick the last.  Therefore, there are $4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24$ integers with 1 as the first digit.  Similarly, another 24 have 2 as the first digit. That's 48 numbers so far, so we want the second smallest number that starts with 3.  The smallest is 31245, and the next smallest is $\\boxed{31254}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the problem and what's required\nWe are given the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and we need to find the 50th positive five-digit integer that can be formed using each of these digits exactly once.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts and formulas\nTo approach this problem, we need to consider the order of the digits and how many different arrangements can be made. We can use the concept of permutations to solve this problem.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of permutations\nThe total number of permutations of 5 different digits is given by 5!. This is because for the first digit, we have 5 choices, for the second digit, we have 4 choices (since one digit is already used), and so on.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the range of numbers for the first 50 integers\nWe need to find the range of numbers for the first 50 integers. We can start by finding the first few numbers in the list:\n12345, 12354, 12435, 12453, 12534, 12543, 13245, 13254, 13425, 13452, 13524, 13542, ...\n\n## Step 5: Identify the pattern and calculate the number of integers in the range\nWe can observe a pattern in the numbers: the first digit is fixed as 1, and the remaining 4 digits are permuted in 4! = 24 ways. This accounts for the first 24 integers in the list.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the remaining number of integers\nSince we need to find the 50th integer, we have already accounted for the first 24 integers. The next 24 integers will start with 2 as the first digit.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the starting point for the next 24 integers\nThe first integer in the next range is the 25th integer, which starts with 2. We need to find the 26th integer in this range.\n\n## Step 8: Find the 26th integer in the range starting with 2\nTo find the 26th integer, we need to find the 2nd integer in the range starting with 213, which is 21345.\n\n## Step 9: Verify the answer\nThe 50th integer is indeed 21345.\n\n## Step 10: Express the answer in the required format\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21345}$"
