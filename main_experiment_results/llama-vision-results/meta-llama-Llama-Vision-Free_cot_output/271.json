    "problem": "Amy was born on a Tuesday. What is the probability that exactly two of her three best friends were also born on Tuesday? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Since her friends' birthdays are completely independent of her own, each of them has a $\\frac{1}{7}$ probability of being born on a Tuesday, and a $1 - \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{6}{7}$ probability of not being born on a Tuesday. If exactly 2 friends were born on a Tuesday, the probability of this occurring is ${3 \\choose 2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{6}{7} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{6}{343} = \\boxed{\\frac{18}{343}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem into manageable steps.\n\n**Step 1: Understand what we're given and what we need to find.**\n\nWe are given that Amy was born on a Tuesday. We need to find the probability that exactly two of her three best friends were also born on Tuesday.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need.**\n\nSince we are dealing with probabilities and combinations, we will need to use the concept of probability and the combination formula.\n\nThe probability of an event is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe combination formula is:\n\nnCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, we have 7 possible days of the week (Monday to Sunday), and we know that Amy was born on a Tuesday. We need to find the probability that exactly two of her three best friends were also born on Tuesday.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step.**\n\nLet's break it down further:\n\n* The probability that any one of Amy's friends was born on a Tuesday is 1/7, since there are 7 possible days of the week.\n* The probability that any one of Amy's friends was not born on a Tuesday is 6/7, since there are 6 other days of the week.\n\nWe want to find the probability that exactly two of Amy's three best friends were also born on Tuesday. This means that one friend was born on a Tuesday and two friends were not born on a Tuesday.\n\nThe probability of this event can be calculated as the product of the probabilities of each individual event:\n\nP(Tuesday, not Tuesday, not Tuesday) = (1/7) \u00d7 (6/7) \u00d7 (6/7)\n\nHowever, we need to consider all possible combinations of exactly two friends being born on Tuesday. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nnCk = 3C2 = 3! / (2!(3-2)!) = 3\n\nSo, there are 3 possible combinations of exactly two friends being born on Tuesday.\n\nThe probability of each of these combinations is:\n\n(1/7) \u00d7 (6/7) \u00d7 (6/7) = 36/343\n\nSince there are 3 possible combinations, we multiply the probability of each combination by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 36/343 = 108/343\n\n**Step 4: Verify our answer and express it in the required format.**\n\nWe have calculated the probability that exactly two of Amy's three best friends were also born on Tuesday. Our answer is 108/343.\n\nTo verify our answer, we can check that it is a valid probability:\n\n0 \u2264 108/343 \u2264 1\n\nThis inequality is true, so our answer is valid.\n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly two of Amy's three best friends were also born on Tuesday is 108/343."
