    "problem": "How many positive three-digit numbers are not multiples of 7?",
    "solution": "It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \\times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $142 \\times 7 = 994$.  Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers which are multiples of 7.  There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-128 = \\boxed{772}$ three-digit numbers which are not multiples of 7.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find**\n\nWe are asked to find the number of positive three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7.\n\nA three-digit number is any number between 100 and 999, inclusive. We want to count how many of these numbers are not divisible by 7.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas**\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll use basic counting and divisibility concepts. We know that a number is divisible by 7 if it leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 7.\n\nWe can count the total number of three-digit numbers and then subtract the number of multiples of 7 to find the desired result.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step**\n\n**Step 3.1: Count the total number of three-digit numbers**\n\nThe smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999. We can count the numbers in this range:\n\n999 - 100 + 1 = 900\n\nThere are 900 three-digit numbers.\n\n**Step 3.2: Count the number of multiples of 7 in the three-digit range**\n\nWe can find the smallest and largest three-digit multiples of 7:\n\nSmallest: 105\nLargest: 994\n\nWe can count the number of multiples of 7 in this range:\n\n994 - 105 = 889\n889 / 7 = 127 (integer division)\n\nThere are 127 multiples of 7 in the three-digit range.\n\n**Step 3.3: Subtract the number of multiples of 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers**\n\nWe subtract the number of multiples of 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers:\n\n900 - 127 = 773\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer**\n\nWe have counted the number of three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7. Let's verify our answer:\n\nThere are indeed 773 three-digit numbers that are not divisible by 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{773}$"
