    "problem": "What is the greatest positive integer $n$ such that $3^n$ is a factor of $200!$?",
    "solution": "If we want the largest such $n$, we must count the number of factors of 3 in the prime factorization of $200!$. The number of multiples of 3 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3} \\right\\rfloor$.  (The notation $\\left\\lfloor x\\right\\rfloor$ means the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, so basically, $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ means ``divide 200 by 3 and round down.\")   However, these are not the only factors of 3 in the product!  Multiples of 9 in the product contribute an extra factor of 3. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{9} \\right\\rfloor$ of these, so we add this number to the $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ factors of 3 we found from counting multiples of 3.  Similarly, we must add in multiples of 27 once and multiples of 81.\n\nThe sum is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{9} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{27} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{81} \\right\\rfloor = 66 + 22 + 7 + 2 = \\boxed{97}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's solve this problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\nWe are given the factorial of 200, denoted as 200!, and we need to find the greatest positive integer $n$ such that $3^n$ is a factor of 200!. In other words, we want to determine the highest power of 3 that divides 200! without leaving a remainder.\n\n**Step 2: Identify key concepts and formulas**\nTo solve this problem, we will use the concept of prime factorization and the formula for the highest power of a prime number $p$ that divides $n!$, which is given by:\n\n$$v_p(n!) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^k} \\right\\rfloor$$\n\nwhere $\\left\\lfloor x \\right\\rfloor$ represents the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step**\n\nTo find the greatest positive integer $n$ such that $3^n$ is a factor of 200!, we need to calculate the highest power of 3 that divides 200!.\n\nUsing the formula, we have:\n\n$$v_3(200!) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3^k} \\right\\rfloor$$\n\nLet's evaluate the floor functions:\n\n$$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 66.67 \\right\\rfloor = 66$$\n$$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{9} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 22.22 \\right\\rfloor = 22$$\n$$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{27} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 7.41 \\right\\rfloor = 7$$\n$$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{81} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 2.47 \\right\\rfloor = 2$$\n$$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{243} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 0.82 \\right\\rfloor = 0$$\n\nNow, we add up the values:\n\n$$v_3(200!) = 66 + 22 + 7 + 2 + 0 = 97$$\n\nTherefore, the greatest positive integer $n$ such that $3^n$ is a factor of 200! is $n = 97$.\n\n**Step 4: Verify and express the answer**\nWe have found that $n = 97$. To verify, we can check if $3^{98}$ is indeed not a factor of 200!. We can do this by trying to divide 200! by $3^{98}$.\n\nHowever, this step is not necessary, as we have already calculated the highest power of 3 that divides 200! using the formula.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{97}$"
