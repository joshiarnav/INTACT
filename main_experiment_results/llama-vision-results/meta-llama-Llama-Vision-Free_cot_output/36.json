    "problem": "How many different three-digit odd numbers can be formed using the digits 3, 4, 5 and 6 if digits cannot be repeated?",
    "solution": "Begin by constructing the number from the units digit and working up to the hundreds digit. There are two possible choices for the units digit: $3$ and $5$ (since the number must be odd). Then, after choosing that digit, there are three possible choices for the tens digit ($4$, $6$, and the remaining odd digit), since digits cannot be repeated. Finally, there are then two possible choices for the hundreds digit. Thus, there are $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{12}$ such numbers that can be formed.",

    "model_solution": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find**\n\nWe are given four digits: 3, 4, 5, and 6. We need to find how many different three-digit odd numbers can be formed using these digits, without repeating any digit.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need**\n\nTo form a three-digit number, we need to arrange the digits in a specific order. Since we are forming odd numbers, the units digit must be odd (3 or 5). We can use the concept of permutations to count the number of ways to arrange the digits.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step**\n\nLet's break down the problem into smaller steps:\n\nStep 3.1: Choose the units digit (odd digit)\n\nThere are 2 options for the units digit: 3 or 5.\n\nStep 3.2: Choose the tens digit\n\nThere are 3 remaining digits to choose from (excluding the units digit).\n\nStep 3.3: Choose the hundreds digit\n\nThere are 2 remaining digits to choose from (excluding the tens digit and units digit).\n\nTo find the total number of different three-digit odd numbers, we need to multiply the number of options at each step:\n\nNumber of options for units digit = 2\nNumber of options for tens digit = 3\nNumber of options for hundreds digit = 2\n\nTotal number of different three-digit odd numbers = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 12\n\n**Step 4: Verify our answer**\n\nWe have found that there are 12 different three-digit odd numbers that can be formed using the digits 3, 4, 5, and 6, without repeating any digit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
