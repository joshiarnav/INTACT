    "problem": "We roll a fair 6-sided die 5 times.  What is the probability that we get a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls?",
    "solution": "The number of ways to roll exactly 2 6's is $\\binom{5}{2}5^3$, since there are $\\binom{5}{2}$ choices for which of the two dice are 6, and there are 5 choices for each of the other 3 dice. Similarly, the number of ways to roll exactly 1 6 is $\\binom{5}{1}5^4$, and the number of ways to roll no 6's is $\\binom{5}{0}5^5$. So the probability is \\[\\frac{\\binom{5}{2}5^3+\\binom{5}{1}5^4+\\binom{5}{0}5^5}{6^5}=\\boxed{\\frac{625}{648}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find**\n\nWe are rolling a fair 6-sided die 5 times. We want to find the probability that we get a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls. This means we want to find the probability of getting 0, 1, or 2 sixes in the 5 rolls.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the concept of binomial probability. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) \\* (p^k) \\* (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting k successes (in this case, getting a 6)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 5 rolls)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (in this case, 1/6, since there is one favorable outcome out of 6 possible outcomes)\n- q is the probability of failure on a single trial (in this case, 5/6, since there are 5 unfavorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes)\n- k is the number of successes we want to find the probability of (in this case, 0, 1, or 2 sixes)\n\nWe will need to calculate the probability of getting 0, 1, or 2 sixes separately and then add them together to find the overall probability.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step**\n\nLet's break down the problem into three cases:\n\n**Case 1: Getting 0 sixes**\n\nUsing the binomial probability formula, we get:\n\nP(X = 0) = (5C0) \\* (1/6)^0 \\* (5/6)^5\n= 1 \\* 1 \\* (5/6)^5\n= (5/6)^5\n\n**Case 2: Getting 1 six**\n\nUsing the binomial probability formula, we get:\n\nP(X = 1) = (5C1) \\* (1/6)^1 \\* (5/6)^4\n= 5 \\* (1/6) \\* (5/6)^4\n= 5 \\* (1/6) \\* (5^4/6^4)\n= 5 \\* 5^4 / 6^5\n\n**Case 3: Getting 2 sixes**\n\nUsing the binomial probability formula, we get:\n\nP(X = 2) = (5C2) \\* (1/6)^2 \\* (5/6)^3\n= 10 \\* (1/36) \\* (5/6)^3\n= 10 \\* (1/36) \\* (5^3/6^3)\n= 10 \\* 5^3 / 6^5\n\nNow, we add the probabilities together:\n\nP(X \u2264 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)\n= (5/6)^5 + 5 \\* 5^4 / 6^5 + 10 \\* 5^3 / 6^5\n\n**Step 4: Verify our answer and express it in the required format**\n\nWe can simplify the expression by finding a common denominator:\n\nP(X \u2264 2) = (5/6)^5 + 5 \\* 5^4 / 6^5 + 10 \\* 5^3 / 6^5\n= (5/6)^5 \\* (1 + 5 \\* 5/6 + 10 \\* 5^2/6^2)\n= (5/6)^5 \\* (1 + 25/6 + 250/36)\n= (5/6)^5 \\* (36 + 150 + 250)/36\n= (5/6)^5 \\* 436/36\n\nTo simplify the expression further, we can cancel out the common factor of 4:\n\nP(X \u2264 2) = (5/6)^5 \\* 109/9\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nP(X \u2264 2) = 109 \\* (5^5 / 6^5) / 9\n= 109 \\* 5^5 / (6^5 \\* 9)\n= 109 \\* 3125 / (6^5 \\* 9)\n= 109 \\* 3125 / 46656\n= 342375/46656\n\u2248 0.7324\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls is approximately 0.7324."
