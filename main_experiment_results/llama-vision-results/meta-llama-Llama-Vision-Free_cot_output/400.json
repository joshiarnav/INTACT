    "problem": "I have a spinner that lands on 1 with a probability of $\\frac{1}{10}$, 2 with a probability of $\\frac{2}{10}$, 3 with a probability of $\\frac{3}{10}$, and 4 with a probability of $\\frac{4}{10}$. If Phil and Sarah both spin the spinner, what is the probability that they get the same number?",
    "solution": "This problem requires a little bit of casework.  There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's. The probability of getting a 1 is $\\dfrac{1}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 1 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{100}$. Similarly, the probability of getting a 2 is $\\dfrac{2}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 2 is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{100}$, the probability of getting a 3 is $\\dfrac{3}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 3 is $\\left(\\dfrac{3}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{9}{100}$ and the probability of getting a 4 is $\\dfrac{4}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 4 is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{16}{100}$. So our answer is $\\dfrac{1}{100}+\\dfrac{4}{100}+\\dfrac{9}{100}+\\dfrac{16}{100}=\\frac{30}{100}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand what we're given and what we need to find.**\n\nWe are given a spinner with 4 numbers: 1, 2, 3, and 4, each with a specific probability of landing on that number. We need to find the probability that Phil and Sarah both get the same number when they spin the spinner.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need.**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the concept of joint probability, which is the probability that two events occur together. In this case, the events are Phil spinning a certain number and Sarah spinning the same number. Since the spinner is independent, we can use the formula for joint probability:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) \u00d7 P(B)\n\nwhere P(A) is the probability of event A occurring, and P(B) is the probability of event B occurring.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step.**\n\nThere are four possible scenarios where Phil and Sarah get the same number:\n1) Both Phil and Sarah spin 1.\n2) Both Phil and Sarah spin 2.\n3) Both Phil and Sarah spin 3.\n4) Both Phil and Sarah spin 4.\n\nWe can calculate the probability of each scenario using the joint probability formula.\n\n**Scenario 1: Both Phil and Sarah spin 1.**\n\nP(Phil spins 1) = $\\frac{1}{10}$\nP(Sarah spins 1) = $\\frac{1}{10}$\nP(Both Phil and Sarah spin 1) = P(Phil spins 1) \u00d7 P(Sarah spins 1) = $\\frac{1}{10}$ \u00d7 $\\frac{1}{10}$ = $\\frac{1}{100}$\n\n**Scenario 2: Both Phil and Sarah spin 2.**\n\nP(Phil spins 2) = $\\frac{2}{10}$\nP(Sarah spins 2) = $\\frac{2}{10}$\nP(Both Phil and Sarah spin 2) = P(Phil spins 2) \u00d7 P(Sarah spins 2) = $\\frac{2}{10}$ \u00d7 $\\frac{2}{10}$ = $\\frac{4}{100}$\n\n**Scenario 3: Both Phil and Sarah spin 3.**\n\nP(Phil spins 3) = $\\frac{3}{10}$\nP(Sarah spins 3) = $\\frac{3}{10}$\nP(Both Phil and Sarah spin 3) = P(Phil spins 3) \u00d7 P(Sarah spins 3) = $\\frac{3}{10}$ \u00d7 $\\frac{3}{10}$ = $\\frac{9}{100}$\n\n**Scenario 4: Both Phil and Sarah spin 4.**\n\nP(Phil spins 4) = $\\frac{4}{10}$\nP(Sarah spins 4) = $\\frac{4}{10}$\nP(Both Phil and Sarah spin 4) = P(Phil spins 4) \u00d7 P(Sarah spins 4) = $\\frac{4}{10}$ \u00d7 $\\frac{4}{10}$ = $\\frac{16}{100}$\n\n**Step 4: Find the total probability.**\n\nTo find the total probability that Phil and Sarah get the same number, we need to add up the probabilities of all four scenarios:\n\nP(Phil and Sarah get the same number) = P(Both Phil and Sarah spin 1) + P(Both Phil and Sarah spin 2) + P(Both Phil and Sarah spin 3) + P(Both Phil and Sarah spin 4)\n= $\\frac{1}{100}$ + $\\frac{4}{100}$ + $\\frac{9}{100}$ + $\\frac{16}{100}$\n= $\\frac{30}{100}$\n= $\\frac{3}{10}$\n\nTherefore, the probability that Phil and Sarah both get the same number is $\\frac{3}{10}$."
