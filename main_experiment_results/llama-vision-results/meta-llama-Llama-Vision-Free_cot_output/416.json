    "problem": "Mary has $6$ identical basil plants, and three different window sills she can put them on. How many ways are there for Mary to put the plants on the window sills?",
    "solution": "Since the plants are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of plants on each window sill.\n\nIf all the plants are on one window  sill, there are $3$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.\n\nIf $5$ plants are on one window sill and the last is on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants go on which window sill.\n\nIf $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.\n\nIf $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are each on one of the other windows, there are $3$ ways to choose which window the $4$ plants are on.\n\nIf $3$ plants are on one window and the other $3$ plants are all on another window, there are $3$ ways to choose which window has no plants.\n\nIf $3$ plants are on one window, $2$ plants on another window, and $1$ plant on the last window, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants are on which windows.\n\nIf $2$ plants are on each window, there is only one way to arrange them.\n\nIn total, there are $3+6+6+3+3+6+1=\\boxed{28}$ ways to arrange the plants on the window sills.\n\nSee if you can find a faster way to do this problem by considering lining up the plants, and placing two dividers among the plants to separate them into three groups corresponding to the sills.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and identify what we need to find.**\n\nWe are given that Mary has 6 identical basil plants and 3 different window sills. We need to find the number of ways to arrange the 6 plants on the 3 window sills.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need.**\n\nThis problem involves combinatorics, specifically the concept of arranging objects in distinct groups. We can use the formula for combinations with repetitions, which is:\n\nC(n + k - 1, k)\n\nwhere n is the number of objects (plants) and k is the number of groups (window sills).\n\nHowever, in this case, we are arranging the plants in distinct groups, so we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the plants within each group. We can use the concept of permutations to solve this part of the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step.**\n\nLet's break down the problem into smaller parts:\n\n* First, let's consider the number of ways to choose 3 window sills out of 3. This is equivalent to arranging the 3 window sills in a row, which can be done in 3! = 6 ways.\n* Next, let's consider the number of ways to arrange the 6 plants on the 3 window sills. We can think of this as distributing the 6 plants into 3 distinct groups, where each group represents a window sill. We can use the formula for combinations with repetitions, but we also need to consider the number of ways to arrange the plants within each group.\n* Since the plants are identical, the order of the plants within each group does not matter. However, the number of plants on each window sill matters. Let's consider the number of ways to distribute the 6 plants into 3 groups of different sizes: (x, y, z), where x + y + z = 6.\n\nWe can count the number of ways to distribute the plants by using the formula for combinations with repetitions. However, we also need to consider the number of ways to arrange the plants within each group.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to distribute the plants and arrange them within each group.**\n\nLet's consider the number of ways to distribute the 6 plants into 3 groups of different sizes: (x, y, z), where x + y + z = 6.\n\nWe can use the stars and bars method to count the number of ways to distribute the plants. The number of ways to distribute the plants is given by:\n\nC(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(8, 2) = 28\n\nHowever, this counts the number of ways to distribute the plants, but it does not take into account the arrangement of the plants within each group.\n\nSince the plants are identical, the order of the plants within each group does not matter. However, the number of plants on each window sill matters. Let's consider the number of ways to arrange the plants within each group.\n\nFor each group (x, y, z), we can arrange the plants in x! ways, y! ways, and z! ways, respectively. However, since the plants are identical, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the plants within each group, which is x!x!... ( repeated x times), y!y!... ( repeated y times), and z!z!... ( repeated z times).\n\nThe total number of ways to arrange the plants is given by:\n\n(6! / (x!x!... (repeated x times)))(6! / (y!y!... (repeated y times)))(6! / (z!z!... (repeated z times)))\n\nSince x + y + z = 6, we can simplify the above expression by considering the different cases:\n\n* (3, 2, 1)\n* (3, 3, 0)\n* (2, 2, 2)\n\nFor each case, we can calculate the number of ways to arrange the plants and multiply it by the number of ways to distribute the plants.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\n\nAfter calculating the number of ways to distribute the plants and arrange them within each group for each case, we can multiply the results together to get the total number of ways to arrange the plants.\n\nLet's calculate the final answer:\n\nCase 1: (3, 2, 1)\n\nNumber of ways to distribute the plants: C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(8, 2) = 28\n\nNumber of ways to arrange the plants within each group:\n\n* 3! / (3!1!0!) = 1\n* 2! / (2!0!) = 1\n* 1! / (1!0!) = 1\n\nTotal number of ways: 28 x 1 x 1 x 1 = 28\n\nCase 2: (3, 3, 0)\n\nNumber of ways to distribute the plants: C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(8, 2) = 28\n\nNumber of ways to arrange the plants within each group:\n\n* 3! / (3!0!0!) = 1\n* 3! / (3!0!0!) = 1\n\nTotal number of ways: 28 x 1 x 1 = 28\n\nCase 3: (2, 2, 2)\n\nNumber of ways to distribute the plants: C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(8, 2) = 28\n\nNumber of ways to arrange the plants within each group:\n\n* 2! / (2!0!0!) = 1\n* 2! / (2!0!0!) = 1\n* 2! / (2!0!0!) = 1\n\nTotal number of ways: 28 x 1 x 1 x 1 = 28\n\nThe total number of ways to arrange the plants is the sum of the number of ways for each case:\n\n28 + 28 + 28 = 84\n\nHowever, we are not done yet. We need to consider the number of ways to arrange the 3 window sills.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final answer.**\n\nThe total number of ways to arrange the plants is 84, but we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the 3 window sills. Since the window sills are distinct, we can arrange them in 3! = 6 ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to arrange the plants is:\n\n84 x 6 = 504\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{504}$"
