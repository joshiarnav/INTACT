    "solution": "In one flip, we have a $1/2$ chance of getting heads and winning 2 dollars, and a $1/2$ chance of getting tails and losing 1 dollar.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\$2) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\$1) = \\boxed{\\$0.50}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand what we're given and what we need to find.**\n\nWe are given a scenario where we win $\\$2$ if we flip a heads on a coin toss, but lose $\\$1$ if we flip tails. We need to find the expected value of our winnings after one flip.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need.**\n\nThe key concept here is the expected value, which is a measure of the average outcome of a random event. In this case, we have two possible outcomes: winning $\\$2$ (with probability 0.5) and losing $\\$1$ (with probability 0.5).\n\nThe formula for expected value is:\n\nE(X) = (probability of outcome 1) \u00d7 (value of outcome 1) + (probability of outcome 2) \u00d7 (value of outcome 2) + ... + (probability of outcome n) \u00d7 (value of outcome n)\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step.**\n\nLet's apply the formula for expected value:\n\nE(X) = (0.5) \u00d7 ($2) + (0.5) \u00d7 (-$1)\n\nE(X) = $1 - $0.5\n\nE(X) = $0.50\n\nSo, the expected value of our winnings after one flip is $0.50.\n\n**Step 4: Verify our answer and express it in the required format.**\n\nWe have found that the expected value of our winnings after one flip is $0.50. This is our final answer.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\nThe final answer is: $0.50"
