    "model_solution": "Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand what we're given and what we need to find**\n\nWe have 4 identical oranges and need to divide them into at most 3 groups, with each group having at least 1 orange. We want to find the number of ways to do this.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need**\n\nSince the oranges are identical, we only need to consider the number of oranges in each group, not the order of the groups. This is a classic problem of distributing identical objects into distinct groups.\n\nWe can use a combination of stars and bars (combinatorial counting) and casework to solve this problem.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step**\n\nLet's consider the possible number of groups: 1, 2, or 3.\n\n* If we have 1 group, there's only 1 way to put all 4 oranges in it.\n* If we have 2 groups, we can use stars and bars to count the number of ways to distribute the 4 oranges. We can represent the 4 oranges as 4 stars, and use 1 bar to separate the two groups. The number of ways to arrange these stars and bars is C(5, 1) = 5, where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n* If we have 3 groups, we again use stars and bars. We can represent the 4 oranges as 4 stars, and use 2 bars to separate the three groups. The number of ways to arrange these stars and bars is C(6, 2) = 15.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where we have 1 orange in one group and 3 oranges in another group. This is equivalent to choosing 1 group to hold the single orange, which can be done in 3 ways.\n\nAdding up the possibilities from each case, we get:\n\n1 (1 group) + 5 (2 groups) + 15 (3 groups) + 3 (1 orange in one group, 3 in another) = 24\n\n**Step 4: Verify our answer and express it in the required format**\n\nWe have found that there are 24 ways to divide the 4 identical oranges into at most 3 groups.\n\nLet's express our answer in the required format:\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$"
