    "problem": "A 6-sided die is weighted so that the probability of any number being rolled is proportional to the value of the roll.  (So, for example, the probability of a 2 being rolled is twice that of a 1 being rolled.)  What is the expected value of a roll of this weighted die?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the probability that a 1 is rolled.  Then the probability that a 2 is rolled is $2x$, the probability that a 3 is rolled is $3x$, and so on.  Since the sum of all these probabilities must be 1, we have that $x + 2x + \\cdots + 6x = 1$, which means that $21x = 1$, so $x = \\frac{1}{21}$.  Therefore \\[ E = \\frac{1}{21}(1) + \\frac{2}{21}(2) + \\cdots + \\frac{6}{21}(6) = \\frac{1^2 + 2^2 + \\cdots 6^2}{21} = \\boxed{\\frac{13}{3}}. \\]",

    "model_solution": "Sounds like a solid approach! Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**1. Understand what we're given and what we need to find:**\n\nWe're given a 6-sided die that's weighted so that the probability of any number being rolled is proportional to the value of the roll. This means that the probability of rolling a 2 is twice that of rolling a 1, the probability of rolling a 3 is three times that of rolling a 1, and so on.\n\nWe need to find the expected value of a roll of this weighted die. The expected value is a measure of the average value we can expect to get if we were to roll the die many times.\n\n**2. Identify the key concepts and formulas we need:**\n\nThe key concept here is the idea of probability being proportional to the value of the roll. We can represent this as follows:\n\nProbability of rolling a 1 = 1/x\nProbability of rolling a 2 = 2/x\nProbability of rolling a 3 = 3/x\n... (and so on)\n\nwhere x is some constant that makes the probabilities add up to 1.\n\nThe formula for expected value is:\n\nExpected value = (sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability)\n\nIn this case, we want to calculate:\n\nExpected value = (1 \u00d7 P(1)) + (2 \u00d7 P(2)) + (3 \u00d7 P(3)) + ... + (6 \u00d7 P(6))\n\nwhere P(1), P(2), ..., P(6) are the probabilities of rolling each number.\n\n**3. Solve the problem step by step:**\n\nLet's start by finding the probability of each outcome. We know that the probabilities add up to 1, so we can write:\n\n1/x + 2/x + 3/x + 4/x + 5/x + 6/x = 1\n\nTo simplify this, we can multiply both sides by x:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = x\n\nThis tells us that x = 21.\n\nNow we can find the probability of each outcome:\n\nP(1) = 1/x = 1/21\nP(2) = 2/x = 2/21\nP(3) = 3/x = 3/21\n...\nP(6) = 6/x = 6/21\n\nNow we can plug these probabilities into the expected value formula:\n\nExpected value = (1 \u00d7 1/21) + (2 \u00d7 2/21) + (3 \u00d7 3/21) + (4 \u00d7 4/21) + (5 \u00d7 5/21) + (6 \u00d7 6/21)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nExpected value = (1/21) + (4/21) + (9/21) + (16/21) + (25/21) + (36/21)\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\nExpected value = (91/21)\n\n**4. Verify our answer and express it in the required format:**\n\nOur answer is the expected value of a roll of the weighted die, which is 91/21.\n\nSince the problem asks us to express our answer as a common fraction, we can leave it as is:\n\nExpected value = 91/21\n\nThis is our final answer!"
