    "problem": "In how many ways can 6 girls and 2 boys sit in a row if the 2 boys insist on sitting next to each other?",
    "solution": "We can consider the two boys as one person, arrange the ``seven'' people first, then arrange the 2 boys.  So the number of seating arrangements in which the boys sit together is $7!\\times 2!=\\boxed{10,\\!080}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find**\n\nWe have 6 girls and 2 boys who need to sit in a row. The constraint is that the 2 boys must sit next to each other. We need to find the total number of ways in which they can sit in a row.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas**\n\nThe key concept here is that we have two distinct cases to consider:\n\n* Case 1: The 2 boys sit together as one unit.\n* Case 2: We need to consider the arrangement of the 2 boys within the unit.\n\nWe will use the formula for permutations to calculate the number of ways the girls can sit in a row, and then multiply it by the number of ways the 2 boys can sit within their unit.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step**\n\n**Step 3.1: Calculate the number of ways the 6 girls can sit in a row**\n\nThere are 6 girls, and they can sit in any order. The number of ways to arrange 6 distinct objects is 6!. Therefore, the number of ways the 6 girls can sit in a row is:\n\n6! = 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 720\n\n**Step 3.2: Calculate the number of ways the 2 boys can sit within their unit**\n\nSince the 2 boys must sit next to each other, we can consider them as one unit. This unit can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways (i.e., boy 1 on the left and boy 2 on the right, or vice versa).\n\n**Step 3.3: Calculate the total number of ways the 6 girls and 2 boys can sit in a row**\n\nWe multiply the number of ways the 6 girls can sit in a row (720) by the number of ways the 2 boys can sit within their unit (2). Therefore, the total number of ways is:\n\n720 \u00d7 2 = 1440\n\n**Step 4: Verify our answer and express it in the required format**\n\nOur answer is 1440, which represents the total number of ways the 6 girls and 2 boys can sit in a row if the 2 boys insist on sitting next to each other."
