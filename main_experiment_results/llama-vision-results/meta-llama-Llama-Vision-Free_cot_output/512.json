    "problem": "Steve has one quarter, two nickels and three pennies. Assuming no items are free, for how many different-priced items could Steve individually pay for with exact change?",
    "solution": "Steve can use no quarters or one quarter, for two possibilities.\n\nSteve can use 0, 1, or 2 nickels, for three possibilities.\n\nAnd Steve can use 0, 1, 2, or 3 pennies, for four possibilities.  That gives $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 = 24$ possible combinations.  But we must remove the combination where Steve does not use any coins, leaving us with $24 - 1 = \\boxed{23}.$",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**1. Understand what we're given and what we need to find:**\n\nSteve has the following coins:\n\n* 1 quarter = $0.25\n* 2 nickels = $0.10 (2 x $0.05)\n* 3 pennies = $0.03 (3 x $0.01)\n\nSteve wants to know how many different-priced items he can individually pay for with exact change using these coins.\n\n**2. Identify the key concepts and formulas we need:**\n\nWe don't need any specific formulas for this problem, but we'll need to think creatively about how Steve can combine his coins to make different amounts.\n\n**3. Solve the problem step by step:**\n\nLet's list all the possible combinations of coins that add up to a whole number of cents:\n\n* Using just the quarter: $0.25\n* Using just the nickels: $0.05, $0.10\n* Using just the pennies: $0.01, $0.02, $0.03\n* Using a combination of coins:\n\t+ Quarter + nickel: $0.30\n\t+ Quarter + pennies: $0.26, $0.27, $0.28\n\t+ Nickel + pennies: $0.06, $0.07, $0.08, $0.09, $0.10\n\t+ Two nickels: $0.10\n\t+ Two nickels + pennies: $0.11, $0.12, $0.13, $0.14, $0.15\n\nWe can make 15 different amounts using Steve's coins:\n\n$0.01, $0.02, $0.03, $0.05, $0.06, $0.07, $0.08, $0.09, $0.10, $0.11, $0.12, $0.13, $0.14, $0.15, $0.25, $0.26, $0.27, $0.28, $0.30, $0.31\n\nHowever, we can simplify this list by removing the duplicate amounts and amounts greater than $0.30:\n\n$0.01, $0.02, $0.03, $0.05, $0.06, $0.07, $0.08, $0.09, $0.10, $0.11, $0.12, $0.13, $0.14, $0.15, $0.25, $0.30\n\nThere are 16 different amounts, but we can make all of these amounts using just the coins Steve has.\n\n**4. Verify our answer and express it in the required format:**\n\nWe've verified that we can make 15 different amounts using Steve's coins, but we can simplify the list to 16 different amounts. We can express the answer in the required format as:\n\nThe final answer is: $16"
