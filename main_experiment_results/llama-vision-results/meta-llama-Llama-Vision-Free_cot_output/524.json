    "solution": "There are two paths from A to B: A to K to B, and A to J to B.  The probability that a log will go from A to K to B is the probability that it will choose the middle flume initially times the probability that it will choose the flume to the right given that it chose the middle flume initially: $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\frac{1}{6}$.  Similarly, the probability that the log will go from A to J to B is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{9}$.  In total, the probability that the log reaches B is $\\dfrac{1}{6}+\\dfrac{1}{9}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find\nWe're given a diagram representing ponds $A, B, C, J$, and $K$ and the flumes (arrows) that logs can use to move from one pond to another. We need to find the probability that a log in pond $A$ will end up in pond $B$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need\nThe problem involves probability and the movement of logs through flumes. Since the logs are equally likely to use any available exit flume, we can apply the concept of equal probability to each exit. The key concept here is the probability of a log choosing an exit flume, which is 1/2 for each available exit.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the problem step by step\nWe can start by considering the initial probability of a log entering pond $A$. Since we're only concerned with the log ending up in pond $B$, we can ignore the other ponds.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of a log entering pond $B$ from pond $A$\nFrom pond $A$, there are three exit flumes, but only one leads to pond $B$. Since the logs are equally likely to use any available exit flume, the probability of a log entering pond $B$ from pond $A$ is 1/3.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of a log entering pond $K$ and then pond $B$\nFrom pond $A$, a log can enter pond $K$ with a probability of 1/2, and then pond $B$ with a probability of 1/2. So, the probability of a log entering pond $K$ and then pond $B$ is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total probability of a log entering pond $B$\nWe can find the total probability of a log entering pond $B$ by adding the probabilities from steps 4 and 5.\n\n## Step 7: Add the probabilities from steps 4 and 5\nTotal probability = probability from step 4 + probability from step 5 = 1/3 + 1/4.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the common denominator\nTo add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 12.\n\n## Step 9: Rewrite the fractions with the common denominator\n1/3 = 4/12 and 1/4 = 3/12.\n\n## Step 10: Add the fractions\n4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12.\n\n## Step 11: The total probability is 7/12.\n\n## Step 12: Express the answer as a common fraction.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{12}}$"
