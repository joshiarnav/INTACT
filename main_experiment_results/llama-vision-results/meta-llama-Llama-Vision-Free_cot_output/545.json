    "problem": "How many subsets of the set of divisors of $72$ contain only composite numbers? For example, $\\{8,9\\}$ and $\\{4,8,12\\}$ are two such sets. Include the empty set in your count.",
    "solution": "We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \\cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem into manageable steps.\n\n**Step 1: Understand what we're given and what we need to find.**\n\nWe are given the set of divisors of 72, and we need to find the number of subsets that contain only composite numbers. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need.**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to:\n\n* Find the set of divisors of 72.\n* Identify which divisors are composite numbers.\n* Use the concept of subsets to count the number of subsets that contain only composite numbers.\n\nNo specific formulas are needed for this problem, but we will likely need to use basic combinatorial concepts and set theory.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step.**\n\nLet's start by finding the set of divisors of 72:\n\nThe prime factorization of 72 is $2^3\\cdot3^2$. To find the set of divisors, we can use the fact that every divisor of 72 can be written in the form $2^a\\cdot3^b$, where $0\\leq a\\leq3$ and $0\\leq b\\leq2$.\n\nUsing this fact, we can list all the divisors of 72:\n\n* $1 = 2^0\\cdot3^0$\n* $2 = 2^1\\cdot3^0$\n* $3 = 2^0\\cdot3^1$\n* $4 = 2^2\\cdot3^0$\n* $6 = 2^1\\cdot3^1$\n* $8 = 2^3\\cdot3^0$\n* $9 = 2^0\\cdot3^2$\n* $12 = 2^2\\cdot3^1$\n* $18 = 2^1\\cdot3^2$\n* $24 = 2^3\\cdot3^1$\n* $36 = 2^2\\cdot3^2$\n* $72 = 2^3\\cdot3^2$\n\nNext, let's identify which divisors are composite numbers. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself.\n\n* $1$ is not composite.\n* $2$ is not composite.\n* $3$ is not composite.\n* $4$ is composite.\n* $6$ is composite.\n* $8$ is composite.\n* $9$ is composite.\n* $12$ is composite.\n* $18$ is composite.\n* $24$ is composite.\n* $36$ is composite.\n* $72$ is composite.\n\nSo, the composite divisors of 72 are $\\{4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36,72\\}$.\n\nNow, let's count the number of subsets that contain only composite numbers. We can use the fact that the empty set is a subset of any set, so we include it in our count.\n\nWe can count the number of subsets by considering the number of elements in the set of composite divisors. There are 9 composite divisors, so the number of subsets is $2^9 = 512$.\n\nHowever, this count includes subsets that contain non-composite divisors. To correct for this, we need to subtract the number of subsets that contain non-composite divisors.\n\nThere are 3 non-composite divisors: $\\{1,2,3\\}$. The number of subsets that contain only these 3 divisors is $2^3 = 8$.\n\nHowever, this count includes the empty set, which we already included in our count of subsets that contain only composite divisors. To correct for this, we need to subtract 1 from this count.\n\nSo, the corrected count is $512 - 8 + 1 = 505$.\n\n**Step 4: Verify our answer and express it in the required format.**\n\nWe have found that the number of subsets of the set of divisors of 72 that contain only composite numbers is 505.\n\nTherefore, our final answer is:\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{505}$"
