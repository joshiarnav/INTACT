    "problem": "How many numbers between 100 and 200 (inclusive) are not perfect squares?",
    "solution": "There are $200-100+1 = 101$ numbers in the list $100, 101, \\ldots, 200$.  We can find 5 perfect squares in the list, namely $10^2,\\ldots,14^2$.  So the number of non-perfect-squares in the list is $101-5=\\boxed{96}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the solution step by step as you suggested.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find**\n\nWe are given a range of numbers from 100 to 200 (inclusive) and need to find how many numbers in this range are not perfect squares.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need**\n\nWe don't need any specific formulas to solve this problem. We just need to identify the perfect squares in the given range and count the remaining numbers.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step**\n\nLet's find the perfect squares between 100 and 200:\n\n* The square root of 100 is 10, and the square root of 200 is approximately 14.14.\n* So, the perfect squares between 100 and 200 are: 121 (11^2), 144 (12^2), and 169 (13^2).\n\nThere are 3 perfect squares between 100 and 200.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of integers between 100 and 200 (inclusive): 200 - 100 + 1 = 101.\n\nSince there are 3 perfect squares, the number of non-perfect squares between 100 and 200 is: 101 - 3 = 98.\n\n**Step 4: Verify our answer and express it in the required format**\n\nOur answer is 98. We have verified that this is correct by counting the total number of integers in the range and subtracting the number of perfect squares.\n\nFinal answer: $\\boxed{98}$"
