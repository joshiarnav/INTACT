    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the problem\nWe are given that $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are three numbers chosen randomly and with replacement from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$. The problem asks for the probability that $ab+c$ is even.\n\n## Step 2: Identifying the key concepts and formulas\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand what makes the expression $ab+c$ even. Since the expression involves multiplication and addition, we can focus on the evenness of $ab$ and then consider the effect of $c$.\n\n## Step 3: Breaking down the cases where ab+c is even\nFor $ab+c$ to be even, we need either $ab$ to be even or $c$ to be even (or both). Let's consider these cases:\n\n- Case 1: $ab$ is even.\n- Case 2: $c$ is even.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing Case 1: ab is even\n$ab$ will be even if either $a$ or $b$ (or both) is even. The even numbers in the given set are 2 and 4. Therefore, for $ab$ to be even, at least one of $a$ or $b$ needs to be chosen from these two options.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the probability for Case 1\nThere are 5 options for each of $a$ and $b$. For $ab$ to be even, we can choose an even number for either $a$ or $b$ (or both), which gives us 2 options for even numbers and 3 options for odd numbers, resulting in a total of 2*5 + 3*5 = 17 options out of 5*5 = 25 possible combinations for $a$ and $b$. The probability for Case 1 is 17/25.\n\n## Step 6: Analyzing Case 2: c is even\n$c$ will be even if it is chosen as 2 or 4. Therefore, there are 2 options for $c$ that would make the expression even.\n\n## Step 7: Calculating the probability for Case 2\nFor the expression $ab+c$ to be even due to $c$, we don't need to consider the values of $a$ and $b$ as long as $c$ is chosen correctly. Since $c$ has 2 options that make it even, and the rest of the combinations (those that don't make $ab$ even) are 3*5 = 15, the probability for Case 2 is 2/5.\n\n## Step 8: Calculating the total probability\nSince these cases are not mutually exclusive (both $ab$ and $c$ can be even), we need to consider the overlap. However, given the structure of our cases, the overlap doesn't directly influence the calculation because the cases are defined in a way that they don't directly overlap in terms of making the expression even. Instead, we'll consider the total probability as the sum of the probabilities for each case.\n\n## Step 9: Final calculation\nWe found the probability for Case 1 to be 17/25 and for Case 2 to be 2/5. Since we are looking for the probability that $ab+c$ is even, we can add these two probabilities together, but we need to express them with a common denominator. However, we should note that the direct addition of these probabilities doesn't necessarily give us the right answer because we've approached the problem from a different angle.\n\n## Step 10: Correcting the approach\nThe correct approach is to directly calculate the probability that $ab+c$ is even without splitting the cases as done previously. This can be done by understanding that the only time $ab+c$ will not be even is when both $a$ and $b$ are odd (because then $ab$ is odd, and the sum of an odd and an odd number is even). This simplifies the calculation significantly.\n\n## Step 11: Simplifying the calculation\nThere are 3 odd numbers in the set (1, 3, 5), and there are 5 options for each of $a$ and $b$. Therefore, the probability that both $a$ and $b$ are odd is (3/5)*(3/5) = 9/25. The probability that $ab+c$ is not even is 9/25. Since we are looking for the probability that $ab+c$ is even, we subtract this from 1.\n\n## Step 12: Calculating the final probability\nThe probability that $ab+c$ is even is therefore 1 - 9/25.\n\n## Step 13: Simplifying the final probability\n1 - 9/25 = (25 - 9) / 25 = 16/25.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{16}{25}}$"
