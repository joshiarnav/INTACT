    "problem": "How many (non-congruent) isosceles triangles exist which have a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the measure of the each of the equal sides.  Since the perimeter is 10 units, the side lengths measure $x$, $x$, and $10-2x$ units.  Since the third side length must be positive, we have $10-2x>0$ which implies $x<5$.  By the triangle inequality, the sum of the two equal sides must exceed the third side.  Solving  $x+x>10-2x$ gives $x>2.5$.  There are $\\boxed{2}$ integers strictly between 2.5 and 5.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find.**\n\nWe are given that we need to find the number of non-congruent isosceles triangles with a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths. An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length, and the perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all three sides.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need.**\n\nFor an isosceles triangle, we can denote the lengths of the two equal sides as \"a\" and the length of the base (the third side) as \"b\". Since the perimeter is 10, we know that:\n\n2a + b = 10\n\nWe also know that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side (triangle inequality). This gives us:\n\na + a > b (or 2a > b)\na + b > a (or b > 0)\nb + a > a (or b > 0)\n\nWe don't need to worry about the last two inequalities, as b is a positive integer.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step.**\n\nLet's list out the possible values of \"a\" and \"b\" that satisfy the equation 2a + b = 10 and the inequality 2a > b.\n\nSince the perimeter is 10, the maximum value of \"a\" is 5 (because 2 \u00d7 5 = 10). We can try different values of \"a\" starting from 5 and decreasing by 1 each time, and see which values of \"b\" satisfy the equation and inequality.\n\nFor a = 5, b = 0 (but b must be positive, so we can eliminate this case)\n\nFor a = 4, b = 2 (this satisfies the equation and inequality)\nFor a = 3, b = 4 (this satisfies the equation and inequality)\nFor a = 2, b = 6 (but 2 \u00d7 2 is not greater than 6, so we can eliminate this case)\nFor a = 1, b = 8 (but 2 \u00d7 1 is not greater than 8, so we can eliminate this case)\n\nWe can stop here, because a = 0 would give us a = 0 and b = 10, which means the triangle would degenerate into a line (not a valid triangle).\n\n**Step 4: Verify our answer and express it in the required format.**\n\nWe have found 2 non-congruent isosceles triangles with a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths: one with side lengths (4, 4, 2) and another with side lengths (3, 3, 4).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
