There are $\\binom{4}{2}=\\frac{4!}{2!2!}=6$ ways to choose two vertical lines and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose two horizontal lines, for a total of $6\\cdot6=\\boxed{36}$ rectangles.",

    "model_solution": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a 3x3 array of squares, and we need to find the total number of rectangles in the array.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key concepts and formulas\nTo find the number of rectangles, we can count the individual squares and then subtract the number of squares that are not part of a rectangle.\n\n## Step 3: Count the individual squares\nThe array is 3x3, so there are 3 rows and 3 columns, making a total of 9 squares.\n\n## Step 4: Identify squares that are not part of a rectangle\nIn a 3x3 grid, the squares that are not part of a rectangle are those on the border of the grid. There are 4 such squares (2 on the top row, 2 on the bottom row).\n\n## Step 5: Count the total number of rectangles\nWe can count the number of rectangles as follows:\n* 1x1 rectangles: There are 9 squares, so there are 9 1x1 rectangles.\n* 2x1 rectangles: There are 6 such rectangles (3 horizontal and 3 vertical).\n* 2x2 rectangles: There is 1 such rectangle.\n* 3x1 rectangles: There is 1 such rectangle.\n* 3x3 rectangles: There is 1 such rectangle.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of rectangles\nWe add up the number of rectangles of each size:\n9 (1x1) + 6 (2x1) + 1 (2x2) + 1 (3x1) + 1 (3x3) = 18\n\n## Step 7: Verify the answer\nWe have counted all the possible rectangles in the array.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$"
