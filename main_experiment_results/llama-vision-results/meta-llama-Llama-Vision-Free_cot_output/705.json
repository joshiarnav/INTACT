    "problem": "Mr. Cole needs to select 3 girls and 5 boys to go on a backpacking trip. In how many ways can he do this if 6 girls and 11 boys are interested in going on the trip?",
    "solution": "In this problem, Mr. Cole is really selecting two separate groups.  He can choose 3 girls from the 6 girls total in $$ \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20 $$ways, and 5 boys from the 11 boys total in $$ \\binom{11}{5} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 462 $$ways.  Since these two selections are independent (since for each of the 20 ways to pick the girls, there are 462 ways to pick the boys), we multiply them together to get the number of ways that we can form the 8-member trip: $$ \\binom{6}{3}\\binom{11}{5} = (20)(462) = \\boxed{9,\\!240}. $$",

Understand what we're given and what we need to find.**\n\nWe are given:\n- 6 girls interested in going on the trip\n- 11 boys interested in going on the trip\n- Mr. Cole needs to select 3 girls and 5 boys for the trip\n\nWe need to find:\n- The total number of ways Mr. Cole can select 3 girls and 5 boys to go on the trip\n\n**2. Identify the key concepts and formulas we need.**\n\nThis problem involves combinations, which is a concept in combinatorics. We need to use the combination formula to find the number of ways to select a certain number of items from a larger group.\n\nThe combination formula is:\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of items to choose from\n- k is the number of items to choose\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations\n- ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)\n\nWe need to use this formula twice:\n- Once to find the number of ways to select 3 girls from 6\n- Once to find the number of ways to select 5 boys from 11\n\n**3. Solve the problem step by step.**\n\nFirst, let's find the number of ways to select 3 girls from 6:\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!)\n= 6! / (3!3!)\n= (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)\n= 20\n\nNext, let's find the number of ways to select 5 boys from 11:\nC(11, 5) = 11! / (5!(11-5)!)\n= 11! / (5!6!)\n= (11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7) / (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)\n= 462\n\n**4. Verify our answer and express it in the required format.**\n\nNow that we have the number of ways to select 3 girls and 5 boys, we can find the total number of ways by multiplying these two numbers:\nTotal number of ways = C(6, 3) \u00d7 C(11, 5)\n= 20 \u00d7 462\n= 9240\n\nTherefore, there are 9240 ways for Mr. Cole to select 3 girls and 5 boys to go on the trip.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9240}$"
