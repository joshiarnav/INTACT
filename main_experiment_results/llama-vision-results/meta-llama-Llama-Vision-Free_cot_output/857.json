    "problem": "Our physics club has $20$ members, among which we have 3 officers: President, Vice President, and Treasurer.  However, one member, Alex, hates another member, Bob.  How many ways can we fill the offices if Alex refuses to serve as an officer if Bob is also an officer? (No person is allowed to hold more than one office.)",
    "solution": "The best way to approach this problem is to use complementary counting. We already know that there are $20 \\times 19 \\times 18$ ways to choose the 3 officers if we ignore the restriction about Alex and Bob.  So now we want to count the number of ways that both Alex and Bob serve as officers.\n\nFor this, we will use constructive counting.  We need to pick an office for Alex, then pick an office for Bob, then put someone in the last office.  We have 3 choices for an office for Alex, either President, VP, or Treasurer.  Once we pick an office for Alex, we have 2 offices left from which to choose an office for Bob.\n\nOnce we have both Alex and Bob installed in offices, we have 18 members left in the club to pick from for the remaining vacant office.  So there are $3 \\times 2 \\times 18$ ways to pick officers such that Alex and Bob are both in an office.  Remember that these are the cases that we want to exclude, so to finish the problem we subtract these cases from the total number of cases.  Hence the answer is: $$ (20 \\times 19 \\times 18) - (3 \\times 2 \\times 18) = ((20 \\times 19)-6) \\times 18 = 374 \\times 18 = \\boxed{6732}. $$",

    "model_solution": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand what we're given and what we need to find.**\n\nWe have a physics club with 20 members, including 3 officers: President, Vice President, and Treasurer. One member, Alex, hates another member, Bob. We need to find the number of ways to fill the offices if Alex refuses to serve as an officer if Bob is also an officer.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need.**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the following:\n\n* The total number of ways to fill the offices without any restrictions (this will be our denominator).\n* The number of ways to fill the offices where Alex and Bob are both officers (this will be our numerator).\n* We can use the concept of permutations to calculate the number of ways to fill the offices.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of ways to fill the offices without any restrictions.**\n\nIf there were no restrictions, there would be 20 choices for the President, 19 choices for the Vice President, and 18 choices for the Treasurer. Therefore, the total number of ways to fill the offices without any restrictions is:\n\n20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18 = 6840\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to fill the offices where Alex and Bob are both officers.**\n\nIf Alex and Bob are both officers, we need to choose one of them as the President, the other as the Vice President, and then choose one of the remaining 18 members as the Treasurer. There are 3 ways to choose the President (either Alex or Bob, and then the other one as the Vice President), and then 18 choices for the Treasurer. Therefore, the number of ways to fill the offices where Alex and Bob are both officers is:\n\n3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to fill the offices if Alex refuses to serve as an officer if Bob is also an officer.**\n\nWe subtract the number of ways to fill the offices where Alex and Bob are both officers from the total number of ways to fill the offices:\n\n6840 - 54 = 6786\n\nTherefore, there are 6786 ways to fill the offices if Alex refuses to serve as an officer if Bob is also an officer.\n\n**Step 6: Verify our answer and express it in the required format.**\n\nOur answer makes sense, as we have taken into account the restriction that Alex refuses to serve as an officer if Bob is also an officer. We have also used the correct formulas to calculate the number of ways to fill the offices.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6786}$"
