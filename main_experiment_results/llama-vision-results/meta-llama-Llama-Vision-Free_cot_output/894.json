    "problem": "Six cars pull up to a red light, one at a time. At the light, there are three lanes, one left-turn lane, one straight-going lane, and one right-turn lane. How many ways can the cars stack up so that all three lanes are occupied?\n\nNote that if the first car turns left and the second goes straight, this is considered different from the first car going straight and the second car turning left. In other words, the cars are distinguishable, but pull up to the intersection in a fixed order.",
    "solution": "We count the number of ways that some lane can be left empty, and subtract from the total number, $3^6=729$ because each driver has three choices. Suppose the left-turn lane is left empty. Then each driver is limited to 2 choices, and there are $2^6$ ways to leave the left-turn lane empty. The same logic gives $2^6$ ways to leave the center lane and right-turn lane open. But we have double-counted the situations where two lanes are left empty. Fortunately, since each driver must go into the third lane, there are only 3 situations we have over-counted. This leaves $3\\cdot2^6-3=189$ ways to leave at least one lane unoccupied, or $729-189=\\boxed{540}$ ways to occupy every lane.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step as you suggested.\n\n**1) Understand what we're given and what we need to find:**\n\nWe have 6 distinguishable cars that pull up to a red light one at a time. There are 3 lanes at the light: a left-turn lane, a straight-going lane, and a right-turn lane. We need to find the number of ways the cars can stack up so that all three lanes are occupied.\n\n**2) Identify the key concepts and formulas we need:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll need to use the concept of permutations with repetition. Since each car can choose from 3 lanes and there are 6 cars, we'll have repeated choices.\n\nThe formula for permutations with repetition is:\n\nn! / (n1! \u00d7 n2! \u00d7 ... \u00d7 nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and ni is the number of items in the ith group.\n\nIn our case, n = 6 (total number of cars), and n1 = n2 = n3 = 2 (each lane can be chosen by two cars).\n\n**3) Solve the problem step by step:**\n\nNow, let's solve the problem step by step:\n\na) Choose the left-turn lane:\nThere are 6 ways to choose the first car, 5 ways for the second car, 4 ways for the third car, 3 ways for the fourth car, 2 ways for the fifth car, and 1 way for the sixth car. This can be represented as 6! = 720 ways to choose the left-turn lane.\n\nb) Choose the straight-going lane:\nSimilarly, there are 6 ways to choose the first car, 5 ways for the second car, 4 ways for the third car, 3 ways for the fourth car, 2 ways for the fifth car, and 1 way for the sixth car. This can be represented as 6! = 720 ways to choose the straight-going lane.\n\nc) Choose the right-turn lane:\nThere are 6 ways to choose the first car, 5 ways for the second car, 4 ways for the third car, 3 ways for the fourth car, 2 ways for the fifth car, and 1 way for the sixth car. This can be represented as 6! = 720 ways to choose the right-turn lane.\n\nd) Multiply the number of ways for each lane:\nTo find the total number of ways to stack up the cars, we multiply the number of ways for each lane:\n\n720 \u00d7 720 \u00d7 720 = 360,720\n\n**4) Verify our answer and express it in the required format:**\n\nWe have found that there are 360,720 ways for the cars to stack up so that all three lanes are occupied. This answer makes sense, as it's a large number of possible arrangements.\n\nNow, let's format our answer:\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{360,720}$"
