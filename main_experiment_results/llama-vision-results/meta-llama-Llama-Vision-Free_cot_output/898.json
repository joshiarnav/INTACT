    "problem": "A bag contains two red beads and two green beads. You reach into the bag and pull out a bead, replacing it with a red bead regardless of the color you pulled out.  What is the probability that all beads in the bag are red after three such replacements? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The beads will all be red at the end of the third draw precisely when two  green beads are chosen in the three draws. If the first bead drawn is  green, then there will be one  green and three red beads in the bag before the second draw. So the probability that  green beads are drawn in the first two draws is $$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}= \\frac{1}{8}.\n$$ The probability that a  green bead is chosen, then a red bead, and then a  green bead, is $$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{32}.\n$$ Finally, the probability that a red bead is chosen then two  green beads is $$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}.\n$$ The sum of these probabilities is $$\n\\frac{1}{8}+ \\frac{3}{32}+ \\frac{1}{16}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{32}}.\n$$",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find.**\n\nWe have a bag with 2 red beads and 2 green beads. We will draw a bead, replace it with a red bead, and repeat this process 3 times. We want to find the probability that all 4 beads in the bag are red after 3 such replacements.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need.**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of conditional probability. We will need to calculate the probability of drawing a red bead at each step, given the previous draws.\n\nWe can use the formula for conditional probability:\n\nP(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\nHowever, since we are replacing the bead each time, the probability of drawing a red bead at each step is the same, and we can simplify our calculations.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step.**\n\nLet's break down the problem into three steps:\n\n**Step 3.1: After the first replacement**\n\nInitially, we have 2 red beads and 2 green beads. We draw a bead and replace it with a red bead.\n\n* Probability of drawing a red bead: 2/4 = 1/2\n* Probability of drawing a green bead: 2/4 = 1/2\n\nAfter the first replacement, we have 3 red beads and 1 green bead.\n\n**Step 3.2: After the second replacement**\n\nWe draw a bead and replace it with a red bead.\n\n* Probability of drawing a red bead: 3/4\n* Probability of drawing a green bead: 1/4\n\nAfter the second replacement, we have 4 red beads and 0 green beads.\n\n**Step 3.3: After the third replacement**\n\nWe draw a bead and replace it with a red bead.\n\n* Probability of drawing a red bead: 4/4 = 1\n* Probability of drawing a green bead: 0/4 = 0\n\nAfter the third replacement, we are certain to have 4 red beads.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final probability**\n\nHowever, we need to take into account that we are drawing a bead and replacing it with a red bead in each step. This means that the probability of having 4 red beads after 3 replacements is the same as the probability of having 4 red beads after the second replacement.\n\nSo, the final probability is the probability of having 4 red beads after the second replacement, which is 3/4.\n\nWe can verify this by considering the possible outcomes after the second replacement:\n\n* 4 red beads: probability 3/4 (since we have 3 red beads and 1 green bead)\n* 3 red beads and 1 green bead: probability 1/4 (since we have 3 red beads and 1 green bead)\n\nThe probability of having 4 red beads after the third replacement is the same as the probability of having 4 red beads after the second replacement, which is 3/4.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$."
