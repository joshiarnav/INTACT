    "solution": "The Binomial Theorem says that, to find the coefficient of $x^ay^b$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^{a+b}$, we choose $a$ of the $(a+b)$ terms to contribute $x$ to the product, then the other $b$ terms contribute a $y$. Similarly, to find the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in $(x+y+z)^8$, we choose 3 of the 8 $(x+y+z)$ terms in the product $(x+y+z)^8$ to contribute an $x$ (which we can do in $\\binom{8}{3}$ ways), 3 of the remaining 5 terms to contribute a $y$ (which we can do in $\\binom{5}{3}$ ways), and the remaining 2 terms contribute $z$'s to the product. Thus, our answer is  \\[\\binom{8}{3}\\binom{5}{3}=56\\cdot 10=\\boxed{560}\\]",

    "model_solution": "Let's solve this step by step as you suggested.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find**\n\nWe are given the expression $(x+y+z)^8$ and we need to find the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in its expansion.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas**\n\nThe key concept here is the Binomial Theorem, which allows us to expand expressions of the form $(a+b)^n$. However, in this case, we have a trinomial $(x+y+z)^8$, so we will need to use the Multinomial Theorem, which is a generalization of the Binomial Theorem.\n\nThe Multinomial Theorem states that for any positive integer $n$, we have:\n\n$$(x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_k)^n = \\sum_{\\substack{n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k \\geq 0\\\\n_1 + n_2 + \\dots + n_k = n}} \\binom{n}{n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k} x_1^{n_1} x_2^{n_2} \\dots x_k^{n_k}$$\n\nwhere $\\binom{n}{n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k}$ is a multinomial coefficient, defined as:\n\n$$\\binom{n}{n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k} = \\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \\dots n_k!}$$\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step**\n\nTo find the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$, we need to find the term in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$ that contains $x^3y^3z^2$. We can apply the Multinomial Theorem with $n=8$, $k=3$, $n_1=3$, $n_2=3$, and $n_3=2$.\n\nUsing the Multinomial Theorem formula, we get:\n\n$$\\binom{8}{3, 3, 2} x^3 y^3 z^2$$\n\nTo calculate the multinomial coefficient, we can use the formula:\n\n$$\\binom{n}{n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k} = \\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \\dots n_k!}$$\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n$$\\binom{8}{3, 3, 2} = \\frac{8!}{3! 3! 2!}$$\n\nExpanding the factorials, we get:\n\n$$\\binom{8}{3, 3, 2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3}{3 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 1}$$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$$\\binom{8}{3, 3, 2} = 56$$\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ is:\n\n$$\\binom{8}{3, 3, 2} = 56$$\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer**\n\nWe have found the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$ to be 56.\n\nLet's verify our answer by plugging it back into the original expression and expanding it:\n\n$$(x+y+z)^8 = \\sum_{\\substack{n_1, n_2, n_3 \\geq 0\\\\n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 8}} \\binom{8}{n_1, n_2, n_3} x^{n_1} y^{n_2} z^{n_3}$$\n\nExpanding the sum, we get:\n\n$$(x+y+z)^8 = x^8 + 8x^7y + 28x^6y^2 + 56x^5y^3 + \\dots$$\n\nLooking at the terms of the expansion, we see that the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ is indeed 56.\n\nWe have verified our answer, and we can conclude that the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$ is indeed 56."
