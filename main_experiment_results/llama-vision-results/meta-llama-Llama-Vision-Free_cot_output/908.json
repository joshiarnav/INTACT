    "problem": "Seven cards each containing one of the following letters C, B, T, A, E, M and H are placed in a hat. Each letter is used only once. Stu will pull four cards out at random and without replacement. What is the probability that Stu pulls out M, A, T, H in this order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that Stu pulls the M out first is 1/7. The probability that he then pulls the A out next is 1/6, since there are now 6 letter remaining.  Continuing in this way, the probability that he pulls out T next is 1/5 and the probability that H then follows is 1/4.  Therefore, the probability that he pulls out M, A, T, H in this order is $1/7 \\times 1/6 \\times 1/5 \\times 1/4 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{840}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step as you suggested.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and what we need to find**\n\nWe have seven cards with letters C, B, T, A, E, M, and H. Stu will pull out four cards at random and without replacement. We need to find the probability that Stu pulls out M, A, T, H in this specific order.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the concept of permutations, which is the number of ways to arrange objects in a specific order. We also need to use the formula for probability, which is:\n\nP(event) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\n\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is that Stu pulls out M, A, T, H in the correct order.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step**\n\nStep 3a: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\n\nWhen Stu pulls out the first card, there are 7 possible cards he can choose from. When he pulls out the second card, there are 6 remaining cards, and so on. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is:\n\n7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 = 840\n\nStep 3b: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes\n\nTo calculate the number of favorable outcomes, we need to consider the specific order of M, A, T, H. There is only one way to arrange these four cards in this order.\n\nStep 3c: Calculate the probability of the favorable outcome\n\nThe probability of the favorable outcome is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nP(M, A, T, H) = 1 / 840\n\nStep 4: Verify the answer and express it in the required format\n\nWe have calculated the probability of Stu pulling out M, A, T, H in the specific order. The answer is:\n\n1/840"
