    "problem": "A Senate committee consists of 5 Republicans, 6 Democrats, and 2 Independents.  A subcommittee of 3 members is randomly chosen.  What is the probability that the subcommittee consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent?",
    "solution": "There are 5 ways to choose a Republican, 6 ways to choose a Democrat, and 2 ways to choose an Independent for a total of $5 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 60$ different subcommittees of a Republican, Democrat, and Independent.   There are $\\binom{13}{3} = \\dfrac{13\\cdot12\\cdot 11}{3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1} = 286$ ways to choose 3 people from 13 to form a committee, so there are 286 possible committees. Therefore, the probability that the subcommittee is made up of a Republican, Democrat, and Independent is $\\dfrac{60}{286} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{30}{143}}$ .",

    "model_solution": "Let's break it down step by step.\n\n**1. Understand what we're given and what we need to find.**\n\nWe have a Senate committee with 5 Republicans, 6 Democrats, and 2 Independents. A subcommittee of 3 members is randomly chosen. We need to find the probability that the subcommittee consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent.\n\n**2. Identify the key concepts and formulas we need.**\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll need to use the concept of combinations. Specifically, we'll need to calculate the total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members from the entire committee, and then find the number of ways to choose 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent. We'll use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\n**3. Solve the problem step by step.**\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members from the entire committee.\n\nLet T be the total number of committee members: T = 5 (R) + 6 (D) + 2 (I) = 13.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members is:\n\nC(13, 3) = 13! / (3!(13-3)!)\n= 13! / (3!10!)\n= (13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)\n= 286\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent.\n\nThere are 5 ways to choose 1 Republican, 6 ways to choose 1 Democrat, and 2 ways to choose 1 Independent.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 1 of each is:\n\n5 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 2 = 60\n\nStep 3: Calculate the probability.\n\nThe probability is the number of ways to choose 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent, divided by the total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members:\n\nP = 60 / 286\n\n**4. Verify our answer and express it in the required format.**\n\nWe've calculated the probability, but let's verify that our answer makes sense. Since the subcommittee is randomly chosen, the probability should be less than 1 (i.e., not 100%).\n\nAfter calculating, we get:\n\nP = 60 / 286 \u2248 0.210\n\nSo, the probability that the subcommittee consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent is approximately 21.0%.\n\nLet's express our answer in the required format:\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{60}{286}}$"
