    "solution": "We let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$.  The set of all possible pairs $(x,y)$ satisfy the inequalities $0<x<2$ and $0<y<2$; we can graph these points as a square on the $x-y$ plane with vertices $(0,0),(2,0),(2,2)$ and $(0,2)$.

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understand what we're given and what we need to find.\nWe are given two real numbers chosen at random between $0$ and $2$. We need to find the probability that the sum of their squares is no more than $4$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas we need.\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of probability and how to calculate it. We also need to use the formula for the area of a circle, as the problem involves the sum of squares, which can be represented as a circle on a coordinate plane.\n\n## Step 3: Next, let's solve the problem step by step.\nLet's consider the two real numbers as coordinates on a coordinate plane. We can represent the condition \"the sum of their squares is no more than $4$\" as a circle with radius $2$ centered at the origin. The area of this circle is $\\pi(2)^2 = 4\\pi$.\n\nWe also need to find the total area of the region on the coordinate plane where the two real numbers can be chosen. This region is a square with side length $2$, so its area is $2^2 = 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Now, let's calculate the probability.\nThe probability that the sum of the squares of the two real numbers is no more than $4$ is equal to the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square. This is given by:\n\n$\\frac{4\\pi}{4} = \\pi$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\pi}$"
