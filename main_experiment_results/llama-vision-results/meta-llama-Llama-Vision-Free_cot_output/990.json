    "problem": "On the $xy$-plane, the origin is labeled with an $M$. The points $(1,0)$, $(-1,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(0,-1)$ are labeled with $A$'s. The points $(2,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(0,2)$, $(-1, 1)$, $(-2, 0)$, $(-1, -1)$, $(0, -2)$, and $(1, -1)$ are labeled with $T$'s. The points $(3,0)$, $(2,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(0, 3)$, $(-1, 2)$, $(-2, 1)$, $(-3, 0)$, $(-2,-1)$, $(-1,-2)$, $(0, -3)$, $(1, -2)$, and $(2, -1)$ are labeled with $H$'s. If you are only allowed to move up, down, left, and right, starting from the origin, how many distinct paths can be followed to spell the word MATH?",
    "solution": "From the M, we can proceed to four different As. Note that the letters are all symmetric, so we can simply count one case (say, that of moving from M to the bottom A) and then multiply by four.\n\nFrom the bottom A, we can proceed to any one of three Ts. From the two Ts to the sides of the A, we can proceed to one of two Hs. From the T that is below the A, we can proceed to one of three Hs. Thus, this case yields $2 \\cdot 2 + 3 = 7$ paths.\n\nThus, there are $4 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{28}$ distinct paths.",

The origin is labeled with an M, and the points (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), and (0,-1) are labeled with A's. The remaining points are labeled with H's. We need to find the number of distinct paths that can be followed to spell the word MATH, starting from the origin, by only moving up, down, left, and right.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key concepts and formulas**\n\nThis problem can be solved using combinatorics and lattice paths. We need to count the number of ways to arrange the steps (up, down, left, right) to spell the word MATH.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the problem step by step**\n\nLet's break down the problem into smaller sub-problems:\n\n* To spell the word MATH, we need to make 4 steps to the right (for the letter M) and 1 step up (for the letter A), and then 3 steps up (for the letter T) and 2 steps up (for the letter H).\n* We can choose the 4 steps to the right in 8C4 = 70 ways.\n* For each of these 70 ways, we can choose the 1 step up in 5C1 = 5 ways.\n* For each of these 350 ways, we can choose the 3 steps up in 7C3 = 35 ways.\n* For each of these 12250 ways, we can choose the 2 steps up in 9C2 = 36 ways.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways for each step:\n\n70 x 5 x 35 x 36 = 220500\n\n**Step 4: Verify the answer**\n\nThe answer makes sense, as we have counted the number of ways to arrange the steps to spell the word MATH.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{220500}$"
