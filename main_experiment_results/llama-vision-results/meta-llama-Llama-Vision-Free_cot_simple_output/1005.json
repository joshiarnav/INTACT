    "problem": "Amy's grandmother gave her 3 identical chocolate chip cookies and 4 identical sugar cookies.  In how many different orders can Amy eat the cookies such that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both?",
    "solution": "We can solve this using complementary counting by finding the number of ways Amy can eat the cookies without eating a chocolate chip cookie first or last, and subtracting that value from the total number of ways Amy can eat the cookies. Since all the chocolate cookies are identical and all the sugar cookies are identical, there are $$\\dbinom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!}=35$$total ways for Amy to eat the cookies. If Amy doesn't eat a chocolate chip cookie first or last, there are $$\\dbinom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!2!}=10$$ways for her to eat the cookies. So, there are $35-10=\\boxed{25}$ ways in which Amy can eat the cookies such that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We need to find the number of different orders in which Amy can eat the cookies, with the condition that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both.\n## Step 2:  First, let's consider the total number of ways Amy can eat the cookies without any restrictions. There are $7$ cookies in total, so the number of ways to eat the cookies is given by $7!$, as there are $7$ choices for the first cookie, $6$ for the second, and so on.\n## Step 3:  However, since the chocolate chip cookies are identical and the sugar cookies are identical, the $3$ chocolate chip cookies are considered the same, and the $4$ sugar cookies are also considered the same. So, we need to divide the total number of ways by $3!$ to account for the identical chocolate chip cookies and by $4!$ to account for the identical sugar cookies.\n## Step 4:  This gives us the total number of ways to eat the cookies without any restrictions as $\\dfrac{7!}{3!4!}$.\n## Step 5:  Next, let's consider the complementary scenario, where Amy eats all the cookies without eating a chocolate chip cookie first, last, or at all. In this case, the only way to eat the cookies is to eat all $4$ sugar cookies first, followed by any order of the remaining $3$ chocolate chip cookies.\n## Step 6:  The number of ways to order these $3$ chocolate chip cookies is given by $3!$, as there are $3$ choices for the first cookie, $2$ for the second, and $1$ for the last.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the total number of ways to eat the cookies without eating a chocolate chip cookie first, last, or at all is $4! \\times 3!$.\n## Step 8:  Applying the principle of complementary counting, the number of ways Amy can eat the cookies such that she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both is given by the total number of ways to eat the cookies minus the number of ways to eat the cookies without eating a chocolate chip cookie first, last, or at all.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the desired number of ways is $\\dfrac{7!}{3!4!} - 4! \\times 3!$.\n## Step 10:   Calculating this gives us $\\dfrac{7!}{3!4!} - 4! \\times 3! = \\dfrac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} - 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 35 - 24 = 11$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$"
