    "problem": "A Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans.  In how many distinguishable ways can they sit around a circular table if all the members of each party all sit next to each other?  (If the table is rotated, it should be counted as the same seating.)",
    "solution": "Choose any 5 consecutive seats in which to place the Democrats -- it doesn't matter which 5 consecutive seats that we choose, since we can rotate the table.  Then there are $5!$ ways to place the Democrats in their seats, and $5!$ ways to place the Republicans in their seats, for a total of $5! \\times 5! = \\boxed{14,\\!400}$ arrangements.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the seating arrangement of the 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans around a circular table, with all members of the same party sitting next to each other.\n## Step 2:  Since the table is circular, if we rotate it, the seating arrangement should be considered the same. This means we need to account for the circular permutations.\n## Step 3:  First, let's consider the Democrats and Republicans as single units and arrange these 2 units around the circular table. There are 2! ways to arrange these 2 units. However, because the table is circular, we have to divide by 2 to account for the rotations that result in the same seating arrangement. So, there are 2!/2 = 1 way to arrange the units around the circular table.\n## Step 4:  Now, within each unit, the 5 members of the same party can be arranged in 5! ways.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the total number of distinguishable ways for the 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans to sit around the circular table, with all members of each party sitting next to each other, is given by the product of the ways to arrange the units and the ways to arrange the members within each unit.\n## Step 6:  This gives us a total of $1\\cdot 5!\\cdot 5!$ ways to seat the committee members around the circular table.\n## Step 7:  Calculating this value, we get $1\\cdot 120\\cdot 120 = 14400$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14400}$"
