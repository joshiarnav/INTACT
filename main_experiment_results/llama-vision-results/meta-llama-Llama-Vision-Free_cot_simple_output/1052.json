    "problem": "A senate committee has 5 Republicans and 4 Democrats.  In how many ways can the committee members sit in a row of 9 chairs, such that all 4 Democrats sit together?",
    "solution": "If we consider the group of Democrats as one person, then there are $6!$ ways to arrange the 6 people (the 5 Republicans and the one Democrat group). Then there are $4!$ ways to arrange arranging the 4 Democrats within their group.  So the number of arrangements is $6! \\times 4! = \\boxed{17,\\!280}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, we need to treat the 4 Democrats as a single unit, which means we have 6 units in total: 5 Republicans and 1 unit of Democrats.\nWe treat the 4 Democrats as a single unit because we want them to sit together.\n\n## Step 2: We can arrange these 6 units in 6! = 720 ways.\nSince there are 6 units in total, we can arrange them in 6! (6 factorial) ways.\n\n## Step 3: However, within the unit of Democrats, the 4 Democrats can also be arranged among themselves in 4! = 24 ways.\nWe need to consider the arrangement of Democrats within their unit as well.\n\n## Step 4: So, in total, the number of ways to arrange the senators is 6! * 4! = 720 * 24 = 17280.\nWe multiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange the Democrats within their unit.\n\n## Step 5: But we also need to consider the arrangement of the 5 Republicans among themselves within the 5 available spots.\nThe 5 Republicans can be arranged among themselves in 5! = 120 ways.\n\n## Step 6: So, in total, the number of ways to arrange the senators is 6! * 4! * 5! = 17280 * 120 = 2073600.\nWe multiply the number of ways to arrange the units, arrange the Democrats within their unit, and arrange the Republicans among themselves.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2073600}$"
