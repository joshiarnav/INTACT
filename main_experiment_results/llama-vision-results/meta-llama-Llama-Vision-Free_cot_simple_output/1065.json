    "problem": "The dartboard below has a radius of 6 inches. Each of the concentric circles has a radius two inches less than the next larger circle. If nine darts land randomly on the target, how many darts would we expect to land in a non-shaded region?\n\n[asy]import graph;\nfill(Circle((0,0),15),gray(0.7));\nfill(Circle((0,0),10),white);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),20));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),15));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),10));\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "The probability for a single dart to land in the non-shaded region is the ratio of the area of the non-shaded region to the area of the entire dartboard. The area of the entire dartboard is $\\pi \\cdot 6^2 = 36\\pi$. The area of the shaded region is the area of the second largest circle minus the area of the smallest circle, or $\\pi \\cdot 4^2 - \\pi \\cdot 2^2 = 12 \\pi$, so the area of the non-shaded region is $36\\pi - 12\\pi = 24\\pi$. Thus, our ratio is $\\frac{24\\pi}{36\\pi}=\\frac{2}{3}$. If each dart has a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance of landing in a non-shaded region and there are 9 darts, then the expected number of darts that land in a non-shaded region is $9 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\boxed{6}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the layout of the dartboard and how the areas of the different regions are related.\n## Step 2:  The dartboard consists of three concentric circles, with the largest circle having a radius of 6 inches, the middle circle having a radius of 4 inches, and the smallest circle having a radius of 2 inches.\n## Step 3:  The shaded region is the area between the middle and smallest circles, and the non-shaded region is the area outside the shaded region but inside the largest circle.\n## Step 4:  We are given that each of the concentric circles has a radius two inches less than the next larger circle.\n## Step 5:  We need to calculate the area of the non-shaded region, which is the area of the largest circle minus the area of the shaded region.\n## Step 6:  The area of the largest circle is $\\pi \\cdot 6^2 = 36\\pi$ square inches.\n## Step 7:  The area of the shaded region is the area of the middle circle minus the area of the smallest circle, which is $\\pi \\cdot 4^2 - \\pi \\cdot 2^2 = 16\\pi - 4\\pi = 12\\pi$ square inches.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the area of the non-shaded region is $36\\pi - 12\\pi = 24\\pi$ square inches.\n## Step 9:  Now, we are given that nine darts land randomly on the target. We need to determine how many darts we would expect to land in the non-shaded region.\n## Step 10:  The proportion of the non-shaded region to the entire dartboard is $\\frac{24\\pi}{36\\pi} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n## Step 11:  So, if nine darts land randomly on the target, we can expect $\\frac{2}{3}$ of them to land in the non-shaded region.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, the expected number of darts to land in the non-shaded region is $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 9 = 6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
