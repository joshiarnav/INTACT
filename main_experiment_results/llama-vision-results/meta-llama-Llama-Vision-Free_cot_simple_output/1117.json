    "problem": "The sequence 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, $\\ldots$ contains all the positive integers from least to greatest that are neither squares nor cubes nor perfect fifth powers (in the form of $x^{5}$, where $x$ is an integer). What is the $1000^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence?",
    "solution": "We see that it's easier to count the number of perfect squares, perfect cubes and perfect fifth powers less than $33^{2}=1089$. We see there are 32 perfect squares less than 1089, which are $1^2$, $2^2$, $\\ldots$, $32^2$ and then there are 10 perfect cubes which are $1^3$, $\\ldots$, $10^3$. There are 4 perfect fifth powers less than 1089 which are $1^5$, $\\ldots$, $4^5$. Then notice there are 3 numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes which are 1, $2^{6} = 64$ and $3^{6} = 729$. There are also 2 numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect fifth powers which are $1^{10} = 1$ and $2^{10} = 1024$. The only number which is both a perfect cube and a perfect fifth power is $1^{15}=1$. The only number which is a perfect square, perfect cube, and perfect fifth power all at the same time is $1^{30}=1$. So within the first 1089 positive integers we need to get rid of $32+10+4-3-2-1+1 =41$ integers which means the $1000^{\\text{th}}$ term is $1000+41 = \\boxed{1041}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the sequence generation criteria\nThe sequence contains all positive integers that are neither squares, cubes, nor perfect fifth powers.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the pattern for squares, cubes, and perfect fifth powers\nSquares are in the form of $x^{2}$, cubes are in the form of $x^{3}$, and perfect fifth powers are in the form of $x^{5}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the maximum value of perfect fifth powers less than the 1000th term\nTo determine the maximum value of perfect fifth powers less than the 1000th term, we need to find the perfect fifth power that is greater than the 1000th term.\n\n## Step 4: Find the perfect fifth power that is greater than the 1000th term\nThe perfect fifth power greater than the 1000th term is $7^{5}=16807$. Therefore, the maximum value of perfect fifth powers less than the 1000th term is $6^{5}=7776$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of perfect fifth powers in the sequence\nThere are 6 perfect fifth powers: $1^{5}, 2^{5}, 3^{5}, 4^{5}, 5^{5},$ and $6^{5}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of squares and cubes in the sequence\nWe need to find the number of squares and cubes that are less than the 1000th term.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of squares in the sequence\nThe largest square less than the 1000th term is $31^{2}=961$. Therefore, there are 31 squares in the sequence.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the number of cubes in the sequence\nThe largest cube less than the 1000th term is $9^{3}=729$. Therefore, there are 9 cubes in the sequence.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the total number of numbers that are squares, cubes, or perfect fifth powers\nWe need to add the number of squares, cubes, and perfect fifth powers, and subtract 1 to avoid double counting $1^{5} = 1^{2} = 1^{3}$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the total number of numbers that are squares, cubes, or perfect fifth powers\nThe total number of numbers that are squares, cubes, or perfect fifth powers is $6 + 31 + 9 - 1 = 45$.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the number of terms in the sequence before the 1000th term\nWe need to subtract the total number of numbers that are squares, cubes, or perfect fifth powers from 999.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the number of terms in the sequence before the 1000th term\nThe number of terms in the sequence before the 1000th term is $999 - 45 = 954$.\n\n## Step 13: Find the 1000th term\nSince the numbers that are squares, cubes, or perfect fifth powers are removed from the sequence, the 1000th term of the sequence will be the 1000th number in the natural numbers, minus the numbers that are squares, cubes, or perfect fifth powers.\n\n## Step 14: Find the 1000th number in the natural numbers\nThe 1000th number in the natural numbers is 1000.\n\n## Step 15: Subtract the numbers that are squares, cubes, or perfect fifth powers from the 1000th number\nWe need to subtract the numbers that are squares, cubes, or perfect fifth powers from the 1000th number.\n\n## Step 16: Find the first perfect fifth power greater than 954\nSince the 1000th term is 954, and we need to find the first perfect fifth power greater than 954.\n\n## Step 17: Find the first perfect fifth power greater than 954\nThe first perfect fifth power greater than 954 is $7^{5}=16807$.\n\n## Step 18: Determine the last perfect fifth power less than the 1000th term\nSince the 1000th term is 954, the last perfect fifth power less than the 1000th term is $6^{5}=7776$.\n\n## Step 19: Find the number of perfect fifth powers that are less than 954\nWe need to find the number of perfect fifth powers that are less than 954.\n\n## Step 20: Find the number of perfect fifth powers that are less than 954\nThere are 6 perfect fifth powers less than 954: $1^{5}, 2^{5}, 3^{5}, 4^{5}, 5^{5},$ and $6^{5}$.\n\n## Step 21: Find the number of squares and cubes that are less than 954\nSince there are 954 numbers in the sequence before the 1000th term, we need to find the number of squares and cubes that are less than 954.\n\n## Step 22: Find the number of squares that are less than 954\nThere are 31 squares less than 954: $1^{2}, 2^{2}, \\ldots, 31^{2}$.\n\n## Step 23: Find the number of cubes that are less than 954\nThere are 9 cubes less than 954: $1^{3}, 2^{3}, \\ldots, 9^{3}$.\n\n## Step 24: Calculate the total number of numbers that are squares, cubes, or perfect fifth powers and less than 954\nWe need to add the number of squares, cubes, and perfect fifth powers, and subtract 1 to avoid double counting $1^{5} = 1^{2} = 1^{3}$.\n\n## Step 25: Calculate the total number of numbers that are squares, cubes, or perfect fifth powers and less than 954\nThe total number of numbers that are squares, cubes, or perfect fifth powers and less than 954 is $6 + 31 + 9 - 1 = 45$.\n\n## Step 26: Find the 954th term of the sequence\nThe 954th term of the sequence is the 954th number in the natural numbers, minus the numbers that are squares, cubes, or perfect fifth powers.\n\n## Step 27: Find the 954th number in the natural numbers\nThe 954th number in the natural numbers is 954.\n\n## Step 28: Calculate the final answer\nWe need to find the number that is 954 - 45 = 909.\n\n## Step 29: Check for squares, cubes, and perfect fifth powers between 909 and 954\nWe need to check for squares, cubes, and perfect fifth powers between 909 and 954.\n\n## Step 30: Check for squares between 909 and 954\nThe largest square less than 954 is 31^2 = 961, so the squares between 909 and 954 are 30^2 = 900.\n\n## Step 31: Check for cubes between 909 and 954\nThe largest cube less than 954 is 9^3 = 729, so there are no cubes between 909 and 954.\n\n## Step 32: Check for perfect fifth powers between 909 and 954\nThe largest perfect fifth power less than 954 is 6^5 = 7776, so there are no perfect fifth powers between 909 and 954.\n\n## Step 33: Determine the 1000th term of the sequence\nSince the numbers that are squares, cubes, or perfect fifth powers are removed from the sequence, the 1000th term of the sequence will be the 1000th number in the natural numbers, minus the numbers that are squares, cubes, or perfect fifth powers.\n\n## Step 34: Find the 1000th term of the sequence\nThe 1000th term of the sequence is 1000 - 45 = 955.\n\n## Step 35: Check if 955 is a square, cube, or perfect fifth power\nWe need to check if 955 is a square, cube, or perfect fifth power.\n\n## Step 36: Check if 955 is a square\n955 is not a square.\n\n## Step 37: Check if 955 is a cube\n955 is not a cube.\n\n## Step 38: Check if 955 is a perfect fifth power\n955 is not a perfect fifth power.\n\n## Step 39: Determine the correct answer\nSince 955 is not a square, cube, or perfect fifth power, it is the 1000th term of the sequence.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{955}$"
