    "problem": "I draw a card from a standard 52-card deck.  If I draw an Ace, I win 1 dollar.  If I draw a 2 through 10, I win a number of dollars equal to the value of the card.  If I draw a face card (Jack, Queen, or King), I win 20 dollars.  If I draw a $\\clubsuit$, my winnings are doubled, and if I draw a $\\spadesuit$, my winnings are tripled.  (For example, if I draw the $8\\clubsuit$, then I win 16 dollars.)  What would be a fair price to pay to play the game?  Express your answer as a dollar value rounded to the nearest cent.\n\nYour answer should be a number with two digits after the decimal point, like $21.43$.",
    "solution": "Let $E_1$ be the expected winnings if a $\\heartsuit$ or $\\diamondsuit$ is drawn.  Since the probability that any particular rank is drawn is the same for any rank, the expected value is simply the average all the winnings for each rank, so \\[ E_1 = \\frac{1}{13}(\\$1+\\$2+\\cdots+\\$10+(3\\times\\$20)) = \\$\\frac{115}{13}. \\]Let $E_2$ be the expected winnings if a $\\clubsuit$ is drawn and $E_3$ the expected winnings if a $\\spadesuit$ is drawn.  Since drawing a $\\clubsuit$ doubles the winnings and drawing a $\\spadesuit$ triples the winnings, $E_2 = 2E_1$ and $E_3 = 3E_1$.  Since there is an equal chance drawing each of the suits, we can average their expected winnings to find the overall expected winnings.  Therefore the expected winnings are \\[ E = \\frac{1}{4}(E_1 + E_1 + E_2 + E_3) = \\frac{1}{4}(7E_1) = {\\$\\frac{805}{52}}, \\]or about $\\boxed{\\$15.48}$, which is the fair price to pay to play the game.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing each type of card\nThe probability of drawing an Ace is 4/52 since there are 4 Aces in a standard 52-card deck.\nThe probability of drawing a 2 through 10 is 9/52 since there are 9 cards in this range.\nThe probability of drawing a face card is 12/52 since there are 12 face cards in a standard 52-card deck.\nThe probability of drawing a $\\clubsuit$ is 13/52 since there are 13 $\\clubsuit$s in a standard 52-card deck.\nThe probability of drawing a $\\spadesuit$ is 13/52 since there are 13 $\\spadesuit$s in a standard 52-card deck.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the expected value of drawing an Ace\nThe expected value of drawing an Ace is $(4/52) \\cdot 1 = 1/13$ dollars.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the expected value of drawing a 2 through 10\nSince there are 9 cards in this range, we can calculate the expected value of drawing a 2 through 10 as follows:\n$(2/52) \\cdot 2 + (3/52) \\cdot 3 + (4/52) \\cdot 4 + (5/52) \\cdot 5 + (6/52) \\cdot 6 + (7/52) \\cdot 7 + (8/52) \\cdot 8 + (9/52) \\cdot 9 + (10/52) \\cdot 10 = 133/52$ dollars.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the expected value of drawing a face card\nThe expected value of drawing a face card is $(4/52) \\cdot 20 + (4/52) \\cdot 20 + (4/52) \\cdot 20 = 160/52$ dollars.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the expected value of drawing a $\\clubsuit$ or a $\\spadesuit$\nTo calculate the expected value of drawing a $\\clubsuit$ or a $\\spadesuit$, we need to consider the probability of drawing a $\\clubsuit$ and a $\\spadesuit$ and the effect of doubling or tripling the winnings. The expected value of drawing a $\\clubsuit$ or a $\\spadesuit$ is:\n$(13/52) \\cdot (1/13) \\cdot 2 + (13/52) \\cdot (133/52) \\cdot 2 + (13/52) \\cdot (160/52) \\cdot 2 + (13/52) \\cdot (1/13) \\cdot 3 + (13/52) \\cdot (133/52) \\cdot 3 + (13/52) \\cdot (160/52) \\cdot 3 = 697/52$ dollars.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the overall expected value of playing the game\nThe overall expected value of playing the game is the sum of the expected values of drawing each type of card:\n$(1/13) + (133/52) + (160/52) + (697/52) = 1059/52$ dollars.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the overall expected value\nTo simplify the overall expected value, we divide the numerator by the denominator:\n$1059/52 = 20.3385$ dollars.\n\n## Step 8: Round the overall expected value to the nearest cent\nThe overall expected value rounded to the nearest cent is $20.34$ dollars.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20.34}$"
