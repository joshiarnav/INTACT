    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To begin solving the given equation, we first need to understand the factorial notation and how it applies to the equation.\n## Step 2:  The expression $n!$ represents the product of all positive integers from $1$ to $n$. For instance, $5! = 5\\cdot4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot1 = 120$.\n## Step 3:  We are given the equation $2(n+1)!+6n!=3(n+1)!$, and we want to find the value of $n$ that satisfies this equation.\n## Step 4:  We start by simplifying the equation using the properties of factorials. We can rewrite $(n+1)!$ as $(n+1)\\cdot n!$, which gives us $2(n+1)\\cdot n! + 6n! = 3(n+1)\\cdot n!$.\n## Step 5:  Next, we factor out $n!$ from the left-hand side of the equation to obtain $n!(2(n+1)+6)=n!(3(n+1))$.\n## Step 6:  This simplifies to $2(n+1)+6=3(n+1)$, as the $n!$ terms cancel out.\n## Step 7:  Now, we can solve for $n$ by expanding the expressions on both sides of the equation. This gives us $2n+2+6=3n+3$.\n## Step 8:  Combining like terms, we get $8= n+3$.\n## Step 9:  To isolate $n$, we subtract $3$ from both sides, yielding $n=5$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the value of $n$ that satisfies the given equation is $n=5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
