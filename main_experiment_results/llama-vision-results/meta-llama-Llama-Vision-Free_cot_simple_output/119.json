    "solution": "To get a constant term, the exponents of $x$ must cancel.  If we take the term with 2 $x^3$'s and 3 $\\frac{1}{x^2}$'s, then they will cancel.  By the Binomial Theorem, this term is $$\\binom52 (10x^3)^2\\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^3=10\\cdot100\\cdot-\\frac{1}{8}\\cdot x^6\\cdot\\frac{1}{x^6}$$$$\\Rightarrow \\frac{1000}{-8}=\\boxed{-125}$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the general form of the expansion.\nThe expansion is given by the binomial theorem, which is $(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k}b^{k}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the terms within the parentheses, $n$ is the power to which the expression is raised, and $\\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the term that will not have any x.\nThe constant term occurs when the powers of x from each term add up to zero. For the first term $10x^3$, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 3, and for the second term $-\\frac{1}{2x^2}$, the coefficient of $x^{-2}$ is -2.\n\n## Step 3: Find k for the constant term.\nTo get the constant term, we want $3(5-k) - 2k = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation from step 3 to find the value of k.\nSimplifying the equation gives $15-3k-2k=0$, which simplifies to $15-5k=0$. Solving for $k$ gives $k = 3$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the constant term.\nNow that we have $k$, we can find the constant term by substituting $k$ into the binomial coefficient and multiplying the appropriate powers of the terms in the parentheses. The constant term is $\\binom{5}{3}(10)^2(-\\frac{1}{2})^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression from step 5 to find the constant term.\n$\\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \\frac{5!}{3!2!} = \\frac{5*4}{2} = 10$. So, the constant term is $10(10)^2(-\\frac{1}{2})^2 = 10*100*\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the product from step 6.\n$10*100*\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1000}{4} = 250$.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{250}$"
