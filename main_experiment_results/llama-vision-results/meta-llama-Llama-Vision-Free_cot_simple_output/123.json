    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the number of diagonals in a pentagonal prism, we first need to understand what constitutes a diagonal in this context.\n## Step 2: A diagonal is a line segment that connects two non-adjacent vertices of the polyhedron. In the case of a pentagonal prism, we have a pentagon as the base and two identical rectangular faces that connect the base to each other.\n## Step 3: The diagonals can be formed by connecting the vertices of the base to the vertices of the other base, or by connecting the vertices of the base to the vertices of the rectangular faces.\n## Step 4: For the base of the prism, which is a pentagon, the number of diagonals can be calculated using the formula for diagonals in a polygon: $n(n-3)/2$, where $n$ is the number of vertices. In this case, the number of diagonals in the base is $5(5-3)/2=5$.\n## Step 5: Now, we need to consider the diagonals formed by connecting the vertices of the base to the vertices of the rectangular faces. Each vertex of the base can be connected to every other vertex of the other base, except for the adjacent vertices. This means there are 4 other vertices that can be connected from each vertex of the base.\n## Step 6: However, we have to account for the fact that the connection from each vertex of the base to the vertices of the other base forms a diagonal, and each of these connections is counted twice (once from each base). Therefore, the total number of diagonals formed by connecting the vertices of the base to the vertices of the rectangular faces is $5\\times4=20$.\n## Step 7: Since we have counted the diagonals formed by connecting the vertices of the base to the vertices of the other base twice, we need to adjust for this overcounting. The correct number of diagonals formed by connecting the vertices of the base to the vertices of the rectangular faces is half of $20$, which is $10$.\n## Step 8: In total, the number of diagonals in the pentagonal prism is the sum of the diagonals in the base and the diagonals formed by connecting the vertices of the base to the vertices of the rectangular faces, which is $5+10=15$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
