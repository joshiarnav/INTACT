    "problem": "In how many ways can 8 people sit around a round table if 3 of the people -- Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas -- all want to sit together?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "First choose three consecutive seats for Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.  It doesn't matter which three consecutive seats that we choose, since any three such seats can be rotated to any other such seats.  Once the three seats are chosen, there are $3!$ ways to seat the three friends there.  The other five seats are for the other five people, so there are $5!$ ways to seat them there.  The answer is $3! \\times 5! = \\boxed{720}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, we need to consider the restriction that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all want to sit together. This means that we can initially treat the three of them as a single entity when thinking about seating arrangements.\n## Step 2:  With 3 people treated as 1 entity, we have a total of 6 entities to arrange around the round table (the single entity of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas, plus the 5 remaining individuals).\n## Step 3:  When arranging 6 entities around a round table, the number of distinct arrangements is given by (6-1)!, which accounts for the fact that rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical.\n## Step 4:  Calculating this, we get (6-1)! = 5! = 120 distinct arrangements for the 6 entities around the round table.\n## Step 5:  However, within the entity of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas, there are 3! ways to arrange the 3 individuals among themselves. This is because there are 3 choices for who sits to the left of the entity, 2 choices for who sits to the right, and the remaining person sits in the middle.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, for each of the 120 distinct arrangements of the 6 entities, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the individuals within the entity of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.\n## Step 7:  Multiplying the number of distinct arrangements of the entities around the table by the number of ways to arrange the individuals within the entity, we get a total of 120 * 6 = 720 ways for 8 people to sit around a round table with the given restriction.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{720}$"
