    "solution": "We start off with $\\emph{1}$ large rectangle. Then the horizontal and vertical lines together split the large rectangle into $\\emph{4}$ smaller rectangles. In addition, the vertical line by itself splits the large rectangle into $\\emph{2}$ rectangles and the horizontal line by itself splits the large rectangle into $\\emph{2}$ other rectangles. There are $1+4+2+2=\\boxed{9}$ different rectangles in the figure.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the total number of rectangles in the figure, we should consider different cases and count the rectangles in each case.\n## Step 2:  First, let's look for the horizontal and vertical lines in the figure. There are two horizontal lines (at $y=0$ and $y=3$) and two vertical lines (at $x=0$ and $x=6$). \n## Step 3:  We can use these lines to form the sides of the rectangles.\n## Step 4:  We'll start by considering the smallest rectangles that can be formed. These are the $1$ by $1$ squares formed by the intersection of two lines.\n## Step 5:  Now, let's count the $1$ by $1$ squares. There are $6$ such squares formed by the intersections of the horizontal and vertical lines.\n## Step 6:  Moving on to larger rectangles, we can count the $2$ by $2$ squares. There is $1$ such square formed by the intersection of the lines at $x=0$ and $x=6$ and the lines at $y=0$ and $y=3$.\n## Step 7:  Next, we have the $1$ by $2$ rectangles. There are $4$ such rectangles formed by the horizontal lines and the vertical lines.\n## Step 8:  Finally, there is $1$ rectangle of size $2$ by $3$ formed by the lines $y=0$, $y=3$, $x=0$, and $x=6$.\n## Step 9:  By adding up all these different types of rectangles, we can find the total number of rectangles in the figure.\n## Step 10:  So, the total number of rectangles is $6+1+4+1=\\boxed{12}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
