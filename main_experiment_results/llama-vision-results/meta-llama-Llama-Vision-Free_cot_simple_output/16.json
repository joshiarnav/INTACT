    "problem": "The letters $A, B$ and $C$ are used to form every possible three letter ``word.'' When these ``words'' are arranged in alphabetical order and numbered so that $AAA$ is Word 1 and $CCC$ is Word 27, what number will correspond to the position of word $BAB$ on the list?",
    "solution": "There are 9 possible words that start with A to begin the list, so the first word starting with B, BAA, is the 10th word. BAB is the next word after BAA, or word number $\\boxed{11}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To determine the position of the word \"BAB\" on the list, we need to understand the pattern of how the words are arranged in alphabetical order.\nThere are 3 choices for the first letter, 3 choices for the second letter, and 3 choices for the third letter.\n\n## Step 2: Since the words are arranged in alphabetical order, we need to count the number of words that come before \"BAB\".\nWe can break this down by counting the words that start with A, then B, and finally the words that start with C.\n\n## Step 3: For words starting with A, there are 3 possible choices for the second letter (B, C, or A), and 3 possible choices for the third letter (A, B or C).\nThis gives us a total of $3 \\times 3 = 9$ words that start with A.\n\n## Step 4: For words starting with B, there are 3 possible choices for the second letter (A, C, or B), and 3 possible choices for the third letter (A, B or C).\nHowever, we want to count only the words that have B as the first letter, so the second letter must be A, and the third letter can be any of the three letters (A, B, or C). This gives us 3 words that start with BA, then 3 words that start with BB (of which \"BAB\" is one), and finally 3 words that start with BC.\n\n## Step 5: The total number of words that start with B and come before \"BAB\" is $3 + 1 + 3 = 7$.\n\n## Step 6: Now we need to add the number of words that start with A and the number of words that start with B and come before \"BAB\" to determine the position of \"BAB\".\nThe total number of words that come before \"BAB\" is $9 + 7 = 16$.\n\n## Step 7: Since \"BAB\" comes after the 16th word, it must be in the 17th position.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17}$"
