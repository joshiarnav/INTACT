    "problem": "A complete cycle of a traffic light takes 60 seconds. During each cycle the light is green for 25 seconds, yellow for 5 seconds, and red for 30 seconds. At a randomly chosen time, what is the probability that the light will NOT be green?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that it will be green is $\\frac{25}{60}=\\frac{5}{12}$. So the probability that it is not green is simply $1-\\frac{5}{12}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{12}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Calculate the total duration of the complete cycle of the traffic light.\nThe complete cycle of the traffic light takes 60 seconds.\n\n## Step 2:  Calculate the duration for which the light is green during each cycle.\nThe light is green for 25 seconds during each cycle.\n\n## Step 3:  Calculate the probability that the light will be green at a randomly chosen time.\nThe probability that the light will be green at a randomly chosen time is the duration for which the light is green divided by the total duration of the cycle, which is 25/60.\n\n## Step 4:  Simplify the fraction 25/60.\nThe fraction 25/60 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5. This results in 5/12.\n\n## Step 5:  Calculate the probability that the light will NOT be green.\nThe probability that the light will NOT be green is 1 minus the probability that the light will be green. This is 1 - 5/12.\n\n## Step 6:  Simplify the expression 1 - 5/12.\nFirst, we need to find a common denominator, which in this case is 12. We can rewrite 1 as 12/12. Then, we have 12/12 - 5/12 = 7/12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{12}}$"
