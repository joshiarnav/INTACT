    "problem": "200 points are equally spaced on the circumference of a circle.  How many squares can be formed with 4 of the 200 points as vertices?",
    "solution": "For any given one of the 200 points, we can find exactly one square with that point as one of the vertices---that point, the point diametrically opposite it, and the endpoints of the diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter formed by connecting the first two points.  Each square then accounts for 4 vertices, so there are $200/4=\\boxed{50}$ squares.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand how squares can be formed using 4 points on the circumference of a circle.\n## Step 2:  The points are equally spaced, which means that any set of 4 points can form a square by selecting points that are 90 degrees apart.\n## Step 3:  To find the number of squares that can be formed, we first need to consider the number of different sets of 4 points that can be chosen from the 200 points on the circle.\n## Step 4:  This is a combination problem, and the number of combinations of 4 points from a total of 200 points can be calculated using the combination formula: $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n## Step 5:  Applying this formula, we get $\\binom{200}{4} = \\frac{200!}{4!(200-4)!} = \\frac{200 \\times 199 \\times 198 \\times 197}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 3,108,105$.\n## Step 6:  However, not all of these combinations will form squares. We need to take into account the rotational symmetry of the circle, where a rotation of the square does not result in a distinct square.\n## Step 7:  To account for this, we need to consider that each square can be rotated 4 times (0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees) and still be considered the same square.\n## Step 8:  Taking this into account, we need to divide the total number of combinations by 4 to get the actual number of squares that can be formed.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the actual number of squares that can be formed is $\\frac{3,108,105}{4} = \\boxed{777,526.25}$, but the answer must be an integer.\n## Step 10:  Upon reevaluation, we realize that we made an error in our calculation. We should be counting the number of squares directly, not the number of combinations of four points.\n## Step 11:  We can select any 4 points from the 200 points on the circle to form a square. However, we must be careful to ensure that the points are 90 degrees apart to form a square.\n## Step 12:  If we fix one point, we can choose 3 other points to form a square. However, not all combinations of 3 points will result in a square due to the requirement of 90-degree angles.\n## Step 13:  If we fix one point, there are 199 other points that can be chosen, but only a subset of these will form squares with the fixed point.\n## Step 14:  The correct approach involves considering the different positions of the first point and then determining how many valid squares can be formed with that point as a vertex.\n## Step 15:  When we choose any point as the first corner of the square, there are 199 other points to choose from, but only a subset of these points will form a square.\n## Step 16:  We need to identify the pattern of valid points that can be chosen to form a square with the fixed point.\n## Step 17:  We can start by choosing a point, and then identify how many points are 90 degrees away from it, which will form the other three corners of the square.\n## Step 18:  Any point that is 90 degrees away from the first point will form a valid square with the first point.\n## Step 19:  To identify the points that are 90 degrees away, we can use the fact that there are 200 equally spaced points on the circumference of the circle.\n## Step 20:  We can visualize the circle and identify the points that are 90 degrees away from a given point.\n## Step 21:  We can see that for any chosen point, there are 50 points that are 90 degrees away, which will form a square with the chosen point.\n## Step 22:  Therefore, the total number of squares that can be formed is $200 \\times 50 = \\boxed{10,000}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10000}$"
