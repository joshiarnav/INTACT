    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of squares of three different sizes whose vertices are points on the given rectangular $3\\times n$ grid of points.\n## Step 2: First, let's analyze the squares of size $1\\times 1$. Each square of this size has its vertices at four of the points on the grid. By visual inspection, we can see that there are $n$ squares of this size in the grid.\n## Step 3: Next, let's consider the squares of size $2\\times 2$. Each square of this size has its vertices at four of the points on the grid. For each square of this size, there are $n-1$ possible locations on the grid. Therefore, there are $(n-1)$ squares of this size in the grid.\n## Step 4: Lastly, let's examine the squares of size $3\\times 3$. Each square of this size has its vertices at four of the points on the grid. For each square of this size, there are $n-2$ possible locations on the grid. Hence, there are $(n-2)$ squares of this size in the grid.\n## Step 5: Now, we know that the total number of squares is 70. Therefore, we can set up the equation $n + (n-1) + (n-2) = 70$ to represent the total number of squares.\n## Step 6: Simplifying the equation, we get $3n - 3 = 70$.\n## Step 7: Adding $3$ to both sides of the equation, we get $3n = 73$.\n## Step 8: Dividing both sides of the equation by $3$, we get $n = 73/3$.\n## Step 9: Since $n$ represents the number of units on the grid, it must be an integer.\n## Step 10: Therefore, we must re-evaluate our equation to ensure we have the correct solution.\n## Step 11: Re-examining the problem, we realize that the equation we derived may not be the correct representation of the total number of squares.\n## Step 12: Let's re-evaluate the number of squares of each size. For each square of size $1\\times 1$, we have $n$ such squares. For each square of size $2\\times 2$, we have $n-1$ such squares. And for each square of size $3\\times 3$, we have $n-2$ such squares.\n## Step 13: However, we also have squares of size $1\\times 2$ and $2\\times 3$. We can count the number of squares of these sizes by visual inspection. There are $n-1$ squares of size $1\\times 2$ and $n-2$ squares of size $2\\times 3$.\n## Step 14: The total number of squares is then given by $n + (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-1) + (n-2) = 70$.\n## Step 15: Simplifying the equation, we get $5n - 6 = 70$.\n## Step 16: Adding $6$ to both sides of the equation, we get $5n = 76$.\n## Step 17: Dividing both sides of the equation by $5$, we get $n = 76/5$.\n## Step 18: Since $n$ represents the number of units on the grid, it must be an integer.\n## Step 19: Therefore, we must re-examine our equation to ensure we have the correct solution.\n## Step 20: Re-examining the problem, we realize that the equation we derived may not be the correct representation of the total number of squares.\n## Step 21: Let's re-evaluate the number of squares of each size. For each square of size $1\\times 1$, we have $n$ such squares. For each square of size $2\\times 2$, we have $n-1$ such squares. For each square of size $3\\times 3$, we have $n-2$ such squares.\n## Step 22: We also have squares of size $1\\times 2$. There are $n$ such squares. We also have squares of size $2\\times 3$. There are $n-1$ such squares.\n## Step 23: The total number of squares is then given by $n + (n-1) + (n-2) + n + (n-1) = 70$.\n## Step 24: Simplifying the equation, we get $4n - 4 = 70$.\n## Step 25: Adding $4$ to both sides of the equation, we get $4n = 74$.\n## Step 26: Dividing both sides of the equation by $4$, we get $n = 74/4$.\n## Step 27: Since $n$ represents the number of units on the grid, it must be an integer.\n## Step 28: Therefore, $n$ must be a whole number.\n## Step 29: The value of $n$ must be an integer, so we can try to find the nearest integer that satisfies the equation.\n## Step 30: In this case, $n = 74/4$ is not an integer, but the nearest integer is $n = 19$, which is not a solution to the equation.\n## Step 31: Let's re-examine the problem. We realize that we need to consider the total number of squares of all sizes on the grid.\n## Step 32: By visual inspection, we can see that there are three squares of size $1\\times 1$, six squares of size $1\\times 2$, and three squares of size $2\\times 2$ in the grid.\n## Step 33: We can also see that there are two squares of size $2\\times 3$ and one square of size $3\\times 3$ in the grid.\n## Step 34: Therefore, the total number of squares is $3 + 6 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15$ for a grid of size $3\\times 6$.\n## Step 35: However, the total number of squares given in the problem is 70.\n## Step 36: Now, let's consider the total number of squares for a grid of size $3\\times n$.\n## Step 37: The total number of squares of size $1\\times 1$ is $n$.\n## Step 38: The total number of squares of size $1\\times 2$ is $n-1$.\n## Step 39: The total number of squares of size $2\\times 2$ is $n-2$.\n## Step 40: The total number of squares of size $2\\times 3$ is $n-3$.\n## Step 41: The total number of squares of size $3\\times 3$ is $1$.\n## Step 42: Therefore, the total number of squares is $n + (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + 1 = 70$.\n## Step 43: Simplifying the equation, we get $5n - 5 = 70$.\n## Step 44: Adding $5$ to both sides of the equation, we get $5n = 75$.\n## Step 45: Dividing both sides of the equation by $5$, we get $n = 75/5$.\n## Step 46: Since $n$ represents the number of units on the grid, it must be an integer.\n## Step 47: Therefore, $n$ must be a whole number.\n## Step 48: The value of $n$ must be an integer, so we can try to find the nearest integer that satisfies the equation.\n## Step 49: In this case, $n = 75/5$ is not an integer, but the nearest integer is $n = 15$, which is a solution to the equation.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$"
