For example, if Annie arrived at 2:00, Xenas could arrive at any time between 2:00 and 2:45 and see Annie at the party.  Let one hour equal one unit.  Then, we can calculate the area of the shaded region as the area of the entire square minus the areas of the two unshaded triangles.  This equals $$2\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4}=\\frac{25}{16}.$$ So the area of the shaded region is $$4-\\frac{25}{16}=\\frac{64-25}{16}= \\frac{39}{16}.$$ Since the area of the square is 4, the probability that Annie and Xenas see each other at the party is $$\\dfrac{39/16}{4} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{39}{64}}.$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we must first understand the time frame in which Annie and Xenas can meet. The party starts at 2:00 and ends at 4:00, which gives us a total of 2 hours. Since each of them stays for 45 minutes, the window in which they can meet is 1.5 hours. We can convert 1.5 hours into minutes to make the calculation easier, which equals 90 minutes.\n\n## Step 2:  Next, we consider the time interval in which Annie and Xenas can see each other. For this to happen, their arrival times must overlap by at least 45 minutes. This means that if we plot their arrival times on a coordinate plane, where the x-axis represents the time Annie arrives and the y-axis represents the time Xena arrives, the region where they see each other would be a square with side length 90 minutes, minus two right-angled triangles outside this square.\n\n## Step 3:  The area of the entire square representing all possible arrival times is $90^2$ square minutes.\n\n## Step 4:  Each triangle outside the desired region has a base and height of 45 minutes, so the area of each is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 45 \\cdot 45 = \\frac{2025}{2}$ square minutes.\n\n## Step 5:  Since there are two triangles, the total area of the triangles is $2 \\cdot \\frac{2025}{2} = 2025$ square minutes.\n\n## Step 6:  The area of the shaded region, where Annie and Xenas see each other, is the area of the entire square minus the area of the two triangles: $90^2 - 2025$ square minutes.\n\n## Step 7:  To find the probability that Annie and Xenas see each other, we calculate the ratio of the shaded area to the entire square, which is $\\dfrac{90^2 - 2025}{90^2}$.\n\n## Step 8:  Simplifying the expression, we get $\\dfrac{8100 - 2025}{8100}$.\n\n## Step 9:  Further simplifying, we get $\\dfrac{6075}{8100}$.\n\n## Step 10:  We can further simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 225.\n\n## Step 11:  Dividing the numerator and the denominator by 225, we get $\\dfrac{6075 \\div 225}{8100 \\div 225}$.\n\n## Step 12:  Simplifying the fraction, we get $\\dfrac{27}{36}$.\n\n## Step 13:  We can further simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9.\n\n## Step 14:  Dividing the numerator and the denominator by 9, we get $\\dfrac{27 \\div 9}{36 \\div 9}$.\n\n## Step 15:  Simplifying the fraction, we get $\\dfrac{3}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$"
