    "problem": "In a math class of 30 students, 12 out of 15 girls are freshmen and 11 out of 15 boys are freshmen. What is the probability that in a randomly selected group of five students from the class, there will be two freshmen girls and three freshmen boys? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest thousandth.",
    "solution": "We can choose 2 freshmen girls and 3 freshman boys in $\\binom{12}{2}\\binom{11}{3} = 10890$ ways.  There are a total of $\\binom{30}{5} = 142506$ possible groups of 5 students we can choose.  Thus the probability of selecting a group of 5 students with 2 freshman girls and 3 freshmen boys is $\\frac{10890}{142506} \\approx \\boxed{0.076}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the number of freshmen girls and boys\nThere are 12 freshmen girls out of 15 girls, which is 12/15. Similarly, there are 11 freshmen boys out of 15 boys, which is 11/15.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of selecting one freshman girl\nThe probability of selecting one freshman girl is 12/15, which can be simplified to 4/5.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of selecting one freshman boy\nThe probability of selecting one freshman boy is 11/15.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to select 2 freshman girls\nThe number of ways to select 2 freshman girls from 12 is represented by the combination formula C(12, 2) = 12! / (2! * (12-2)!) = 66.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to select 3 freshman boys\nThe number of ways to select 3 freshman boys from 11 is represented by the combination formula C(11, 3) = 11! / (3! * (11-3)!) = 165.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of ways to select 5 students\nThe total number of ways to select 5 students from 30 is represented by the combination formula C(30, 5) = 30! / (5! * (30-5)!) = 142,506.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total number of ways to select 2 freshman girls and 3 freshman boys\nThe total number of ways to select 2 freshman girls and 3 freshman boys is the product of the number of ways to select 2 freshman girls and 3 freshman boys, which is 66 * 165 = 10,890.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the probability of selecting 2 freshman girls and 3 freshman boys\nThe probability of selecting 2 freshman girls and 3 freshman boys is the ratio of the total number of ways to select 2 freshman girls and 3 freshman boys to the total number of ways to select 5 students, which is 10,890 / 142,506.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the probability\nThe probability is 10,890 / 142,506, which is approximately 0.0764.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.076}$"
