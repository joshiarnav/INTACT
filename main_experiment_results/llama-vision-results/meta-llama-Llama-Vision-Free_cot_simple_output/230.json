    "solution": "The number of three-point sets that can be chosen from the nine grid points is \\[\n\\binom{9}{3} = \\frac{9!}{3!\\cdot 6!} = 84.\n\\]Eight of these sets consist of three collinear points: 3 sets of points lie on vertical lines, 3 on horizontal lines, and 2 on diagonals. Hence the probability is $8/84 = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{21}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks for the probability that three randomly chosen points on a grid lie on the same straight line.\n## Step 2:  First, we need to understand the total number of possible three-point sets on the grid. There are $9$ points in total, and we need to choose $3$ of them to form a set. This can be calculated using combinations, denoted as $\\binom{n}{k}$, where $n$ is the total number of items to choose from, and $k$ is the number of items to choose. So, the total number of sets is $\\binom{9}{3}=84$.\n## Step 3:  Now, we need to identify the sets of points that lie on the same straight line. These sets can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines. For horizontal lines, there are $3$ possible lines, and for vertical lines, there are also $3$ possible lines. This makes a total of $6$ lines. However, for diagonal lines, there are $2$ possible lines.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, the total number of successful outcomes is $3 + 3 + 2 = 8$.\n## Step 5:  With the total number of possible outcomes and the number of successful outcomes determined, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of successful outcomes by the total number of outcomes.\n## Step 6:  The probability is $\\frac{8}{84} = \\frac{2}{21}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{21}}$"
