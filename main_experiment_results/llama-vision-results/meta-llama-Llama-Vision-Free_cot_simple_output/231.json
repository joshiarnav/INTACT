    "problem": "Alex has four books of different sizes which he wishes to place on a bookshelf. Unfortunately, the bookshelf has a conspicuous hole at one end through which only the smallest book can fall. If he wishes for all his books to stay stationary, in how many ways can he arrange his books?",
    "solution": "The smallest book cannot be placed at one end, so there are three positions which it can occupy. The other books can each be placed in any of the three remaining positions, giving $3!$ arrangements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $3\\times3!=\\boxed{18\\text{ ways.}}$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the constraint\nThe hole at one end of the bookshelf means only the smallest book can fall through it, and the other three books must stay on the shelf. This constraint implies that the smallest book can only occupy the first position on the shelf.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of choices for the first position\nSince the smallest book must be in the first position, there is only 1 choice for this position.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of arrangements for the remaining three books\nAfter the smallest book is placed in the first position, there are 3 remaining books to be arranged on the shelf. These 3 books can be arranged in 3! (3 factorial) ways, which is the number of permutations of 3 items. 3! = 3*2*1 = 6.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of arrangements\nTo find the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of choices for the first position by the number of arrangements for the remaining three books. total_arrangements = 1 * 6 = 6.\n\n## Step 5: Account for the fact that the order of the remaining books matters\nSince the order of the remaining three books matters, we need to consider all possible arrangements of these books. This is already accounted for in the calculation of 3!.\n\n## Step 6: Consider if any of the 4 books can fall through the hole\nThe problem states that only the smallest book can fall through the hole, so we must ensure that it is always in the first position.\n\n## Step 7: Verify if the solution accounts for the unique arrangement of the smallest book\nSince the smallest book must be in the first position, we have verified that our solution correctly accounts for this constraint.\n\n## Step 8: Review the solution for any errors or omissions\nOur solution correctly identified the constraint, calculated the arrangements for the remaining books, and accounted for the unique arrangement of the smallest book.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
