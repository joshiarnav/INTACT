    "problem": "A fisherman can see seven aquatic creatures in a lake --- four crocodiles, a catfish, and two giant squid. If he does not wish to fish two crocodiles consecutively, in how many orders can he catch all seven creatures? (Individuals from the same species are indistinguishable.)",
    "solution": "The crocodiles must be separated from each other by one of the other creatures, so he must catch them first, third, fifth, and seventh. For the second, fourth, and sixth slots, there are $3!$ ways to arrange the remaining three creatures.\n\nHowever, there are two giant squid, so we must divide by $2!$, the number of ways to arrange the squid.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{3!}{2!}=\\boxed{3}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe have seven aquatic creatures in a lake: four crocodiles, one catfish, and two giant squid. The fisherman wants to catch all seven creatures but does not want to catch two crocodiles consecutively. We need to find the number of orders in which he can catch all seven creatures.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the total number of arrangements without restrictions\nFirst, let's consider the total number of arrangements of the seven aquatic creatures without any restrictions. We have 7 positions to fill, and for each position, we have a choice of 7 creatures (since individuals from the same species are indistinguishable). However, once a choice is made, that choice cannot be repeated. Therefore, the total number of arrangements without restrictions is given by 7! (7 factorial), which equals 5040.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of arrangements with two consecutive crocodiles\nWe need to find the number of arrangements where two crocodiles are caught consecutively. To do this, we can treat the two consecutive crocodiles as a single entity, which we'll call \"CC\". Now, we have six entities to arrange: CC, the catfish, and the two giant squid. We can arrange these six entities in 6! (6 factorial) ways. However, within the \"CC\" entity, the two crocodiles can be arranged in 2! ways, which also needs to be accounted for. Thus, the total number of arrangements with two consecutive crocodiles is 6! * 2! = 1440.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of valid arrangements\nTo find the number of valid arrangements where the fisherman does not catch two crocodiles consecutively, we need to subtract the number of arrangements with two consecutive crocodiles from the total number of arrangements without restrictions. Therefore, the number of valid arrangements is 5040 - 1440 = 3600.\n\n## Step 5: Account for the presence of two giant squid\nSince the two giant squid are considered indistinguishable, we have overcounted by a factor of 2! (2 factorial) in the previous steps. To account for this, we need to divide the result by 2!.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final answer\nAfter accounting for the presence of two giant squid, the final answer is 3600 / 2 = 1800.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1800}$"
