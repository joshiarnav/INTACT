    "problem": "The positive five-digit integers that use each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 exactly once are ordered from least to greatest. What is the $50^{\\text{th}}$ integer in the list?",
    "solution": "We start with the numbers that start with 1.  There are 4 ways to pick the next digit, then 3 ways to pick the third digit, 2 ways to pick the fourth, and 1 to pick the last.  Therefore, there are $4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24$ integers with 1 as the first digit.  Similarly, another 24 have 2 as the first digit. That's 48 numbers so far, so we want the second smallest number that starts with 3.  The smallest is 31245, and the next smallest is $\\boxed{31254}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are tasked with finding the 50th integer in a list of positive five-digit integers that use each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 exactly once.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the structure of the integers\nTo approach this, we can break down the process of generating these integers into steps based on the leading digit. We'll examine the number of integers that start with each possible digit and then determine the 50th integer.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of integers starting with 1\nWhen the integer starts with 1, there are 4! = 24 possible arrangements of the remaining digits. This is because we have 4 remaining digits to arrange in 4! ways.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of integers starting with 2\nSimilarly, when the integer starts with 2, there are also 24 possible arrangements of the remaining digits. This means we have a total of 24 + 24 = 48 integers starting with 1 or 2.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the 50th integer\nSince we know that the first 48 integers start with either 1 or 2, the 50th integer must start with the digit 3.\n\n## Step 6: Find the 50th integer starting with 3\nNow, we need to find the 2nd integer starting with 3. We can do this by arranging the remaining digits in increasing order.\n\n## Step 7: Arrange the remaining digits in increasing order\nThe remaining digits are 1, 4, and 5. To get the 2nd integer starting with 3, we need to arrange these digits in increasing order.\n\n## Step 8: Arrange the digits to get the 50th integer\nThe 2nd integer starting with 3 is 31245.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{31254}$"
