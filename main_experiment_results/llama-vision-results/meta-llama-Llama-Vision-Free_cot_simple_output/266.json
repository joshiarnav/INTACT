    "problem": "Suppose that we win $\\$3$ if we flip a heads on a coin toss, but lose $\\$2$ if we flip tails.  What is the expected value, in dollars, of our winnings after one flip?",
    "solution": "In one flip, we have a $1/2$ chance of getting heads and winning 3 dollars, and a $1/2$ chance of getting tails and losing two dollars.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\$3) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\$2) = \\boxed{\\$0.50}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the possible outcomes of a single coin flip.\nFor a single coin flip, there are two possible outcomes: heads or tails.\n\n## Step 2: Assign a value to each outcome.\nWe win $\\$3$ if we flip heads, but lose $\\$2$ if we flip tails.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of each outcome.\nSince the coin is fair, the probability of flipping heads is $\\frac{1}{2}$ and the probability of flipping tails is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the expected value using the probabilities and the assigned values.\nTo find the expected value, we multiply the value of each outcome by its probability and then add these products together. For heads, this is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\$3$ and for tails, it is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (-\\$2)$. Then we add these two values together.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the arithmetic to find the expected value.\nExpected value = (value of heads $\\times$ probability of heads) + (value of tails $\\times$ probability of tails)\nExpected value = ($\\$3 \\times \\frac{1}{2}$) + ($-\\$2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}$)\nExpected value = $\\$1.50 - \\$1.00$\nExpected value = $\\$0.50$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.5}$"
