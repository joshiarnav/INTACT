    "problem": "If two standard six-sided dice are tossed, what is the probability that a 5 is rolled on at least one of the two dice? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle for this problem. The probability of getting a 5 on the first roll is obviously $\\frac{1}{6}$, as it is on the second roll. So, the probability of getting a 5 on at least one of the rolls would appear to be $2\\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$. But this is not quite right. We have double counted the case of rolling a 5 twice. In that instance, we have included it in both the count for a 5 on the first roll and the second roll, when it only should have been included once overall. So, our answer is $\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{36} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the possible outcomes when rolling two six-sided dice\nWhen rolling two dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes, so there are a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes for two dice.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the outcomes where at least one of the dice shows a 5\nTo find the probability of rolling at least one 5, we can count the outcomes where at least one die shows a 5. There are two scenarios to consider:\n- Scenario 1: Exactly one die shows a 5.\n- Scenario 2: Both dice show a 5.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of outcomes where exactly one die shows a 5\nIn this scenario, we have two cases to consider:\n- Case 1: The first die shows a 5 and the second die does not.\n- Case 2: The first die does not show a 5 and the second die shows a 5.\nFor Case 1, there is 1 outcome where the first die shows a 5 (5/6 probability) and 5 outcomes where the second die does not show a 5 (5/6 probability), resulting in 1 * 5 = 5 outcomes. Similarly, for Case 2, there are 5 outcomes where the first die does not show a 5 (5/6 probability) and 1 outcome where the second die does show a 5 (1/6 probability), also resulting in 5 * 1 = 5 outcomes.\nTherefore, the total number of outcomes where exactly one die shows a 5 is 5 + 5 = 10 outcomes.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of outcomes where both dice show a 5\nThere is only 1 outcome where both dice show a 5 (1/6 probability for each die), resulting in 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36 outcomes.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of outcomes where at least one die shows a 5\nAdding the outcomes from Step 3 and Step 4, we get 10 + 1 = 11 outcomes where at least one die shows a 5.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of rolling at least one 5\nTo find the probability, we divide the number of outcomes where at least one die shows a 5 by the total number of possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is 11/36.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}$"
