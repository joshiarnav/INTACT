    "problem": "Amy was born on a Tuesday. What is the probability that exactly two of her three best friends were also born on Tuesday? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Since her friends' birthdays are completely independent of her own, each of them has a $\\frac{1}{7}$ probability of being born on a Tuesday, and a $1 - \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{6}{7}$ probability of not being born on a Tuesday. If exactly 2 friends were born on a Tuesday, the probability of this occurring is ${3 \\choose 2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{6}{7} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{6}{343} = \\boxed{\\frac{18}{343}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the probability that exactly two of Amy's three best friends were also born on Tuesday, we need to consider the probability of each friend being born on a Tuesday and the probability of the other not being born on a Tuesday.\n## Step 2:  Since each of Amy's three best friends can be born on a Tuesday with a probability of $\\frac{1}{7}$, we can use this to calculate the probability of exactly two of them being born on a Tuesday.\n## Step 3:  We need to choose 2 friends out of the 3 to be born on a Tuesday. This can be done in $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ ways.\n## Step 4:  For each of these 3 choices, the probability that the 2 chosen friends were born on a Tuesday and the other was not is $\\left( \\frac{1}{7} \\right) ^2 \\left( \\frac{6}{7} \\right) = \\frac{6}{343}$.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the probability that exactly two of Amy's three best friends were also born on Tuesday is $3\\cdot \\frac{6}{343} = \\frac{18}{343}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{18}{343}}$"
