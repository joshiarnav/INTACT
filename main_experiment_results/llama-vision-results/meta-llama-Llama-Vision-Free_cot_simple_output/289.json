    "problem": "Ben flips a fair nickel four times. What is the probability that Ben flips Head, Tail, Head, Tail, in that order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Since any given flip has equal probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of being a Head or a Tail, and all outcomes are equally likely, the precise sequence given is equal to $\\frac{1}{2^4} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks for the probability of Ben flipping a Head, Tail, Head, Tail in that specific order when he flips a fair nickel four times.\n## Step 2:  Since Ben is flipping a fair nickel, each flip has 2 possible outcomes - Head or Tail. This means that for each flip, the probability of getting either Head or Tail is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n## Step 3:  The events of each flip are independent, so the probability of getting a Head on the first flip and a Tail on the second flip, and so on, is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each individual event.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, the probability of getting a Head on the first flip is $\\frac{1}{2}$, the probability of getting a Tail on the second flip is also $\\frac{1}{2}$, and so on for the remaining two flips.\n## Step 5:  Multiplying these probabilities together gives us the probability of the sequence of flips happening in the specified order.\n## Step 6:  So, the probability of getting a Head, followed by a Tail, then a Head, and finally a Tail in that order is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$"
