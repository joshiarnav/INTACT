    "problem": "How many positive three-digit numbers are not multiples of 7?",
    "solution": "It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \\times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $142 \\times 7 = 994$.  Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers which are multiples of 7.  There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-128 = \\boxed{772}$ three-digit numbers which are not multiples of 7.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the number of positive three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7, we can first determine the total number of three-digit numbers, which is found by subtracting the smallest three-digit number (100) from the largest three-digit number (999) and adding 1.\n## Step 2:  Starting with 100 and ending with 999, we have a total of $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$ three-digit numbers.\n## Step 3:  Now, we need to identify the multiples of 7 within this range of three-digit numbers. The first three-digit multiple of 7 is $7 \\cdot 14 = 98$, and the last three-digit multiple of 7 is $7 \\cdot 142 = 994$.\n## Step 4:  To find the number of three-digit multiples of 7, we can subtract the smallest three-digit multiple of 7 (which is 98) from the largest three-digit multiple of 7 (which is 994), and then divide by 7, and add 1 to account for the inclusive range.\n## Step 5:  This gives us $\\frac{994 - 98}{7} + 1 = 128$, which means there are 128 three-digit multiples of 7.\n## Step 6:  To find the number of three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7, we subtract the number of three-digit multiples of 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers, giving us $900 - 128 = \\boxed{772}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{772}$"
