    "problem": "What is the remainder when $301^4$ is divided by 10,000?",
    "solution": "By the Binomial Theorem, we have  \\begin{align*}\n301^4 &= (3(100) + 1)^4\\\\\n&= \\binom40 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 100^4 \\cdot 1^0 + \\binom41 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 100^3 \\cdot 1^1 \\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad+ \\binom42 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 100^2 \\cdot 1^2+ \\binom43 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 100^1 \\cdot 1^3 \\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad+ \\binom44 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 100^0 \\cdot 1^4.\n\\end{align*} All but the last two terms are divisible by $10000=100^2$, so we only have to consider the remainder when the last two terms are divided by 10,000. The last two terms are  \\begin{align*}\n\\binom43 &\\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 100^1 \\cdot 1^3 + \\binom44 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 100^0 \\cdot 1^4\\\\\n&= 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1\\\\\n& = 1200 + 1 = \\boxed{1201}.\\end{align*}",
