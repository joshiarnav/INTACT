    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand what the expression $\\dbinom{22}{19}$ represents.\nThe expression $\\dbinom{22}{19}$ represents the number of ways to choose 19 items from a set of 22 distinct items without considering the order of selection. This is known as a combination.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the formula for combinations.\nThe formula for combinations is given by $\\dbinom{n}{r} = \\dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $r$ is the number of items to choose, and $!$ denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the given values into the combination formula.\nHere, $n = 22$ and $r = 19$. We need to calculate $\\dbinom{22}{19} = \\dfrac{22!}{19!(22-19)!}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression using factorial properties.\nWe know that $22! = 22 \\times 21 \\times 20 \\times 19!$, and $(22-19)! = 3!$. So the expression simplifies to $\\dfrac{22 \\times 21 \\times 20 \\times 19!}{19! \\times 3!}$.\n\n## Step 5: Cancel out the common terms.\nThe $19!$ in the numerator and the denominator cancel out, leaving $\\dfrac{22 \\times 21 \\times 20}{3!}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the factorial of 3.\n$3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute the value of 3! back into the expression and simplify.\n$\\dfrac{22 \\times 21 \\times 20}{6} = \\dfrac{9240}{6}$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the final value.\n$\\dfrac{9240}{6} = 1540$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1540}$"
