    "problem": "What is the greatest positive integer $n$ such that $3^n$ is a factor of $200!$?",
    "solution": "If we want the largest such $n$, we must count the number of factors of 3 in the prime factorization of $200!$. The number of multiples of 3 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3} \\right\\rfloor$.  (The notation $\\left\\lfloor x\\right\\rfloor$ means the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, so basically, $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ means ``divide 200 by 3 and round down.\")   However, these are not the only factors of 3 in the product!  Multiples of 9 in the product contribute an extra factor of 3. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{9} \\right\\rfloor$ of these, so we add this number to the $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ factors of 3 we found from counting multiples of 3.  Similarly, we must add in multiples of 27 once and multiples of 81.\n\nThe sum is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{9} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{27} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{81} \\right\\rfloor = 66 + 22 + 7 + 2 = \\boxed{97}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the greatest positive integer $n$ such that $3^n$ is a factor of $200!$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the method\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate how many factors of 3 are in the prime factorization of $200!$. We can count the multiples of 3, then add the multiples of $3^2$, and so on.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of factors of 3 in the prime factorization of 200!\nWe start by counting the multiples of 3 in the prime factorization of 200!. There are 66 multiples of 3, which is the floor of $200/3$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of factors of $3^2$ in the prime factorization of 200!\nWe then count the multiples of $3^2$ in the prime factorization of 200!. There are 22 multiples of $3^2$, which is the floor of $200/9$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of factors of $3^3$ in the prime factorization of 200!\nWe then count the multiples of $3^3$ in the prime factorization of 200!. There are 7 multiples of $3^3$, which is the floor of $200/27$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of factors of $3^4$ in the prime factorization of 200!\nWe then count the multiples of $3^4$ in the prime factorization of 200!. There is 2 multiples of $3^4$, which is the floor of $200/81$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of factors of $3^5$ in the prime factorization of 200!\nWe then count the multiples of $3^5$ in the prime factorization of 200!. There is 0 multiples of $3^5$, which is the floor of $200/243$.\n\n## Step 8: Find the total number of factors of 3\nThe total number of factors of 3 is the sum of the factors of $3^1$, $3^2$, $3^3$, $3^4$, and $3^5$. This is $66 + 22 + 7 + 2 + 0 = 97$.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the greatest positive integer n\nThe greatest positive integer $n$ such that $3^n$ is a factor of $200!$ is the total number of factors of 3, which is 97.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{97}$"
