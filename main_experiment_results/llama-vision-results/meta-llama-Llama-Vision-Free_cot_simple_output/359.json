    "problem": "Joe's batting average is .323.  (That is, he averages 0.323 hits per at bat.)  What is the probability that he will get three hits in three at-bats? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "Each of Joe's hits is independent of the others. That is, the probability for one hit does not change depending on whether he hit or missed the previous ball. So, to calculate the probability that he will get three hits in three at-bats, we simply cube $0.323$ to get $0.033$. Rounded to the nearest hundredth, this gives $\\boxed{0.03}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the problem\nTo find the probability that Joe will get three hits in three at-bats, we need to understand the nature of his batting average. His batting average of .323 means that in any given at-bat, the probability of him getting a hit is .323, and the probability of him not getting a hit is 1 - .323 = .677.\n\n## Step 2: Identifying the type of distribution\nThis is a binomial distribution problem because each at-bat is a Bernoulli trial with two possible outcomes (hit or no hit), and we are interested in the probability of a specific number of successes (hits) in a fixed number of trials (at-bats).\n\n## Step 3: Applying the binomial probability formula\nThe probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials, where the probability of success on each trial is p, is given by the binomial probability formula: P(X=k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). Here, we want to find the probability of getting exactly 3 hits in 3 at-bats, so n=3, k=3, p=.323, and (1-p)=.677.\n\n## Step 4: Calculating the binomial coefficient\nThe binomial coefficient \"n choose k\", denoted as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\", is calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!). For this problem, \"3 choose 3\" equals 3! / (3!(3-3)!) = 1, since there is only one way to choose all the items.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the probability\nUsing the values from step 3 and the binomial coefficient from step 4 in the binomial probability formula: P(X=3) = (1) * (.323)^3 * (.677)^(3-3) = (.323)^3 * (.677)^0 = (.323)^3.\n\n## Step 6: Computing the value\nNow, we need to compute the value of (.323)^3.\n\n## Step 7: Performing the calculation\n(.323)^3 = .323 * .323 * .323 = .105361.\n\n## Step 8: Rounding the answer to the nearest hundredth\nThe probability that Joe will get three hits in three at-bats is approximately .1054 when rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\n## Step 9: Converting the result to a decimal\nWe already have the result as a decimal, so no conversion is needed.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.11}$"
