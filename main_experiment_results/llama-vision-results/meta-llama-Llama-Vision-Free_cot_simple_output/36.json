    "problem": "How many different three-digit odd numbers can be formed using the digits 3, 4, 5 and 6 if digits cannot be repeated?",
    "solution": "Begin by constructing the number from the units digit and working up to the hundreds digit. There are two possible choices for the units digit: $3$ and $5$ (since the number must be odd). Then, after choosing that digit, there are three possible choices for the tens digit ($4$, $6$, and the remaining odd digit), since digits cannot be repeated. Finally, there are then two possible choices for the hundreds digit. Thus, there are $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{12}$ such numbers that can be formed.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the restrictions for the three-digit odd number.\nTo form a three-digit odd number, the units place can only be filled by an odd digit. From the given set of digits (3, 4, 5, 6), the odd digits available are 3 and 5.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of possibilities for the units place.\nSince there are two odd digits (3 and 5) available to fill the units place, there are 2 possibilities.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of possibilities for the hundreds place.\nAfter choosing a digit for the units place, there are three remaining digits (including the even digits 4 and 6, in addition to the remaining odd digit) available to fill the hundreds place. Therefore, there are 3 possibilities.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of possibilities for the tens place.\nAfter choosing digits for the units and hundreds place, there are two remaining digits available to fill the tens place. Therefore, there are 2 possibilities.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of different three-digit odd numbers that can be formed.\nTo find the total number of different three-digit odd numbers that can be formed, we need to multiply the number of possibilities for each place. This is because each choice in one place can be combined with each choice in the other places.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
