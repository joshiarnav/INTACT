    "problem": "For how many positive integer values of $n$ is $3^n$ a factor of $15!$?",
    "solution": "We first determine the largest positive integer value of $n$ such that $3^n | 15!$. We determine this by counting the number of factors of 3 in the product.  There are 5 multiples of 3 in the product, and there is one extra factor of 3 in 9, so there are a total of  $5+ 1 = \\boxed{6}$ factors of 3 in the product of the first 15 integers. So, for all $n$ between 1 and 6, inclusive, $3^n$ is a factor of 15!.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Factorize the number 15! and the number $3^n$\nFirst, let's understand what 15! means. It represents the product of all positive integers up to 15, i.e., $15! = 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times \\ldots \\times 2 \\times 1$. To find out if $3^n$ is a factor of $15!$, we need to analyze the prime factorization of both numbers.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the prime factorization of 15!\nThe prime factorization of 15! includes all prime numbers up to 15. The prime factorization of 15! will be $15! = 2^i \\times 3^j \\times 5^k \\times \\ldots$, where $i$, $j$, and $k$ represent the powers of the prime numbers 2, 3, and 5, respectively.\n\n## Step 3: Find the number of factors of 3 in 15!\nTo determine the number of factors of 3 in 15!, we will find the highest power of 3 that divides 15!. We can find this by counting the number of multiples of 3, 3^2, 3^3, and so on, up to 15. The highest power of 3 that divides 15! is $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{15}{3}\\right\\rfloor +\\left\\lfloor\\frac{15}{3^2}\\right\\rfloor +\\left\\lfloor\\frac{15}{3^3}\\right\\rfloor$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of factors of 3 in 15!\n$\\left\\lfloor\\frac{15}{3}\\right\\rfloor +\\left\\lfloor\\frac{15}{3^2}\\right\\rfloor +\\left\\lfloor\\frac{15}{3^3}\\right\\rfloor = 5 + 1 + 0 = 6$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the number of values of $n$ for which $3^n$ is a factor of 15!\nSince $3^6$ is the highest power of 3 that divides 15!, any positive value of $n$ less than or equal to 6 will make $3^n$ a factor of 15!.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
