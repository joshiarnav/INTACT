    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what the expression $\\dbinom{n}{r}$ represents. This expression, read as \"n choose r,\" calculates the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items without regard to the order of selection. The formula for $\\dbinom{n}{r}$ is given by $\\dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$.\n## Step  Step 2:  We are required to compute the value of $\\dbinom{16}{4}-\\dbinom{16}{12}$. Let's start by evaluating each of these binomial coefficients individually.\n## Step  Step 3:  The expression $\\dbinom{16}{4}$ represents the number of ways to choose 4 items from a set of 16 items, and we can calculate it using the formula as $\\dfrac{16!}{4!(16-4)!} = 1820$.\n## Step  Step 4:  Similarly, $\\dbinom{16}{12}$ represents the number of ways to choose 12 items from a set of 16 items, which we can also compute using the formula as $\\dfrac{16!}{12!(16-12)!} = 560$.\n## Step  Step 5:  Now, to find the value of $\\dbinom{16}{4}-\\dbinom{16}{12}$, we simply subtract the value of $\\dbinom{16}{12}$ from $\\dbinom{16}{4}$, which gives us $1820 - 560 = \\boxed{1260}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1260}$"
