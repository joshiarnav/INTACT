    "problem": "We roll a fair 6-sided die 5 times.  What is the probability that we get a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls?",
    "solution": "The number of ways to roll exactly 2 6's is $\\binom{5}{2}5^3$, since there are $\\binom{5}{2}$ choices for which of the two dice are 6, and there are 5 choices for each of the other 3 dice. Similarly, the number of ways to roll exactly 1 6 is $\\binom{5}{1}5^4$, and the number of ways to roll no 6's is $\\binom{5}{0}5^5$. So the probability is \\[\\frac{\\binom{5}{2}5^3+\\binom{5}{1}5^4+\\binom{5}{0}5^5}{6^5}=\\boxed{\\frac{625}{648}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of outcomes when rolling a die 5 times.\nThe total number of outcomes when rolling a die 5 times is $6^5$ since each roll has 6 possible outcomes and there are 5 rolls in total.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to get no 6's in the 5 rolls.\nTo get no 6's in the 5 rolls, each roll must be one of the other 5 numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). Thus, there are $5^5$ ways to get no 6's in the 5 rolls.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to get exactly one 6 in the 5 rolls.\nTo get exactly one 6 in the 5 rolls, one roll must be a 6, and the other four rolls must be one of the other 5 numbers. There are $\\binom{5}{1} = 5$ ways to choose which roll will be the 6, and $5^4$ ways to choose the other four rolls. Thus, there are $(\\binom{5}{1})(5^4) = (5)(625) = 3125$ ways to get exactly one 6 in the 5 rolls.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to get exactly two 6's in the 5 rolls.\nTo get exactly two 6's in the 5 rolls, two rolls must be 6's, and the other three rolls must be one of the other 5 numbers. There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to choose which rolls will be 6's, and $5^3$ ways to choose the other three rolls. Thus, there are $(\\binom{5}{2})(5^3) = (10)(125) = 1250$ ways to get exactly two 6's in the 5 rolls.\n\n## Step 5: Add the number of ways to get no 6's, exactly one 6, and exactly two 6's in the 5 rolls.\nThe sum of the number of ways to get no 6's, exactly one 6, and exactly two 6's in the 5 rolls is $5^5 + 3125 + 1250 = 3125 + 3125 + 1250 = 7500$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls.\nThe probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls is $\\dfrac{7500}{6^5} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{125}{162}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{125}{162}}$"
