    "problem": "I have a spinner that lands on 1 with a probability of $\\frac{1}{10}$, 2 with a probability of $\\frac{2}{10}$, 3 with a probability of $\\frac{3}{10}$, and 4 with a probability of $\\frac{4}{10}$. If Phil and Sarah both spin the spinner, what is the probability that they get the same number?",
    "solution": "This problem requires a little bit of casework.  There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's. The probability of getting a 1 is $\\dfrac{1}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 1 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{100}$. Similarly, the probability of getting a 2 is $\\dfrac{2}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 2 is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{100}$, the probability of getting a 3 is $\\dfrac{3}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 3 is $\\left(\\dfrac{3}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{9}{100}$ and the probability of getting a 4 is $\\dfrac{4}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 4 is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{16}{100}$. So our answer is $\\dfrac{1}{100}+\\dfrac{4}{100}+\\dfrac{9}{100}+\\dfrac{16}{100}=\\frac{30}{100}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the probability of both Phil and Sarah getting the same number on each possible outcome.\nTo calculate the probability that both Phil and Sarah get the same number, we need to consider each possible outcome where they both land on the same number, and then add those probabilities together.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of both landing on 1.\nThe probability that Phil lands on 1 is $\\frac{1}{10}$, and similarly, the probability that Sarah lands on 1 is $\\frac{1}{10}$. So, the probability that both land on 1 is $(\\frac{1}{10}) * (\\frac{1}{10}) = \\frac{1}{100}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of both landing on 2.\nThe probability that Phil lands on 2 is $\\frac{2}{10}$, and similarly, the probability that Sarah lands on 2 is $\\frac{2}{10}$. So, the probability that both land on 2 is $(\\frac{2}{10}) * (\\frac{2}{10}) = \\frac{4}{100}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of both landing on 3.\nThe probability that Phil lands on 3 is $\\frac{3}{10}$, and similarly, the probability that Sarah lands on 3 is $\\frac{3}{10}$. So, the probability that both land on 3 is $(\\frac{3}{10}) * (\\frac{3}{10}) = \\frac{9}{100}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of both landing on 4.\nThe probability that Phil lands on 4 is $\\frac{4}{10}$, and similarly, the probability that Sarah lands on 4 is $\\frac{4}{10}$. So, the probability that both land on 4 is $(\\frac{4}{10}) * (\\frac{4}{10}) = \\frac{16}{100}$.\n\n## Step 6: Sum the probabilities of all the equal outcomes to find the total probability that Phil and Sarah get the same number.\nAdding the probabilities calculated in steps 2 through 5: $\\frac{1}{100} + \\frac{4}{100} + \\frac{9}{100} + \\frac{16}{100} = \\frac{30}{100}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction.\n$\\frac{30}{100}$ can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10. So, $\\frac{30}{100} = \\frac{3}{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$"
