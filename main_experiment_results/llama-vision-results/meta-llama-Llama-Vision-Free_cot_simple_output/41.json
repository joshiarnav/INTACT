    "problem": "An ant is walking on a hexagon. At each step, he moves from the vertex on which he is standing to an adjacent vertex. After $15$ steps, what is the probability that he is standing on the same vertex on which he began?",
    "solution": "There are two ways in which the ant can return to his original vertex: either he can go part of the way around the hexagon and then retrace his steps, or he can go all the way around the hexagon. In the first case, the ant necessarily moves an even number of steps, because his total number of steps is twice the number of steps needed to get to the point at which he begins to retrace. In the second case, because a hexagon has an even number of vertices, the ant is again moving an even number of steps. Thus, he has no way to return to the vertex on which he began in an odd number of steps, so the probability is $\\boxed{0}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are dealing with an ant moving on a hexagon, where it moves from one vertex to an adjacent one at each step.\n## Step 2:  The question asks for the probability that after 15 steps, the ant is standing on the same vertex on which it began.\n## Step 3:  To approach this problem, we need to consider the possible paths the ant can take and calculate the probability of ending up back at the starting vertex.\n## Step 4:  The ant must end up back at the starting vertex after 15 steps if it has taken an odd number of steps in either direction (either $6$ steps in one direction and 9 steps in the other, or 9 steps in one direction and 6 steps in the other).\n## Step 5:  Now, let's consider the probability of the ant taking 6 steps in one direction and 9 steps in the other. There are $10$ ways to order 6 steps in one direction and 9 steps in the other.\n## Step 6:  The probability that the ant takes 6 steps in one direction and 9 steps in the other is $\\frac{10}{6!9!}$, as there are $10$ ways to arrange these steps and $6!9!$ ways to arrange any 6 steps in one direction and 9 steps in the other.\n## Step 7:  Similarly, the probability of the ant taking 9 steps in one direction and 6 steps in the other is also $\\frac{10}{9!6!}$.\n## Step 8:  Since these are mutually exclusive events, we can find the total probability by adding them together: $\\frac{10}{6!9!} + \\frac{10}{9!6!}$.\n## Step 9:  After simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{10}{6!9!} + \\frac{10}{9!6!} = \\frac{20}{6!9!} = \\frac{5}{6!7!}$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the probability that the ant ends up back at the starting vertex after 15 steps is $\\frac{5}{6!7!}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2176}}$"
