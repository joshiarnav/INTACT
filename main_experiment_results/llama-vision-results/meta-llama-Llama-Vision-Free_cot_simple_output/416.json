    "problem": "Mary has $6$ identical basil plants, and three different window sills she can put them on. How many ways are there for Mary to put the plants on the window sills?",
    "solution": "Since the plants are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of plants on each window sill.\n\nIf all the plants are on one window  sill, there are $3$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.\n\nIf $5$ plants are on one window sill and the last is on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants go on which window sill.\n\nIf $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.\n\nIf $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are each on one of the other windows, there are $3$ ways to choose which window the $4$ plants are on.\n\nIf $3$ plants are on one window and the other $3$ plants are all on another window, there are $3$ ways to choose which window has no plants.\n\nIf $3$ plants are on one window, $2$ plants on another window, and $1$ plant on the last window, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants are on which windows.\n\nIf $2$ plants are on each window, there is only one way to arrange them.\n\nIn total, there are $3+6+6+3+3+6+1=\\boxed{28}$ ways to arrange the plants on the window sills.\n\nSee if you can find a faster way to do this problem by considering lining up the plants, and placing two dividers among the plants to separate them into three groups corresponding to the sills.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are trying to find the number of ways to arrange 6 identical plants on 3 different window sills.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize the indistinguishable nature of the plants\nSince the plants are identical, the only thing that matters is which window sill each plant is on, not which specific plant is on which window sill.\n\n## Step 3: Choose the distribution of plants\nWe can use a \"stars and bars\" approach to choose the distribution of plants on the window sills. This means we need to choose how many plants will go on each window sill.\n\n## Step 4: Enumerate possible distributions\nThere are only a few ways to distribute 6 identical plants among 3 window sills. We can have all 6 plants on one window sill, or we can distribute them among two or three window sills.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways for each distribution\n- All 6 plants on one window sill: There are 3 ways to choose which window sill has all 6 plants.\n- 5 plants on one window sill, 1 on another: There are 3 ways to choose which window sill has 5 plants, and 2 ways to choose which window sill has 1 plant.\n- 4 plants on one window sill, 2 on another: There are 3 ways to choose which window sill has 4 plants, and 2 ways to choose which window sill has 2 plants.\n- 4 plants on one window sill, 1 on another, 1 on another: There are 3 ways to choose which window sill has 4 plants, and 3 ways to choose which of the remaining two window sills has 1 plant.\n- 3 plants on one window sill, 3 on another: There are 3 ways to choose which window sill has 3 plants.\n- 3 plants on one window sill, 2 on another, 1 on another: There are 3 ways to choose which window sill has 3 plants, and 2 ways to choose which of the remaining two window sills has 2 plants.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate total number of ways\nSum up the number of ways for each distribution:\n3 (all 6 on one) + 3*2 (5 on one, 1 on another) + 3*2 (4 on one, 2 on another) + 3*3 (4 on one, 1 on each of the others) + 3 (3 on one, 3 on another) + 3*2 (3 on one, 2 on one of the others) = 3 + 6 + 6 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 33\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the calculation\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for the number of ways to choose k items from n items with repetition, which is given by the formula $n+k-1 \\choose k$. In this case, we have $3+6-1 \\choose 6$, which is ${8 \\choose 6}$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate ${8 \\choose 6}$\nTo calculate ${8 \\choose 6}$, we can use the formula ${n \\choose k} = {n! \\over k!(n-k)!}$, where $n!$ denotes the factorial of n.\n${8 \\choose 6} = {8! \\over 6!(8-6)!} = {8! \\over 6!2!} = {8*7 \\over 2} = 28$\n\n## Step 9: Account for identical plants\nSince the plants are identical, however, we must divide that number by the number of ways to arrange the plants among themselves. Since we have 6 identical plants, there are 6! ways to arrange them, but we are only considering how the plants are distributed among the window sills, not which plant is which on a particular window sill.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the plants among themselves\nSince we are not considering which plant is which on a particular window sill, we do not need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the plants among themselves.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the final answer\nSince we are considering the distribution of the plants on the window sills, not the arrangement of the plants among themselves, we do not need to divide the result from step 8 by the number of ways to arrange the plants among themselves.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$"
