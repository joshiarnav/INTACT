    "problem": "Suppose that we win $\\$2$ if we flip a heads on a coin toss, but lose $\\$1$ if we flip tails.  What is the expected value, in dollars, of our winnings after one flip?",
    "solution": "In one flip, we have a $1/2$ chance of getting heads and winning 2 dollars, and a $1/2$ chance of getting tails and losing 1 dollar.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\$2) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\$1) = \\boxed{\\$0.50}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To calculate the expected value of our winnings after one flip, we need to consider the possible outcomes of the coin toss and their associated probabilities.\n## Step 2:  There are two possible outcomes when flipping a coin: heads or tails.\n## Step 3:  For each outcome, there's a specific amount of money we win or lose. If we flip heads, we win $\\$2$, and if we flip tails, we lose $\\$1$.\n## Step 4:  Now, to find the expected value, we multiply the probability of each outcome by the amount we win or lose in that outcome. The probability of flipping heads is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of flipping tails is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n## Step 5:  So, the expected value is calculated as: $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times (\\2) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times (-1)$.\n## Step 6:  This simplifies to $\\frac{\\2}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}$.\n## Step 7:  Simplifying further, we get $1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the expected value, in dollars, of our winnings after one flip is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$"
