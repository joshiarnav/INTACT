    "problem": "I have four identical oranges. How many ways are there for me to divide these oranges into at most three groups?  (By definition, a group must have at least one orange.)",
    "solution": "All the oranges can go in one group, or $3$ can go in one group and $1$ in another group, or $2$ can go in one group and $2$ in another group, or $2$ can go in one group and each of the other $2$ can be in a group by itself.\n\nAs a list, we have: \\begin{align*}\n&4 \\\\\n&3,1\\\\\n&2,2\\\\\n&2,1,1.\n\\end{align*} This gives a total of $\\boxed{4}$ possibilities.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of oranges\nThere are 4 identical oranges.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the possible number of groups\nWe are dividing the oranges into at most three groups, meaning we can have 1, 2, or 3 groups.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the distribution for 1 group\nIf we have only 1 group, there is only 1 way to distribute the oranges since all 4 oranges must go into this group.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the distribution for 2 groups\nFor 2 groups, we have several possibilities:\n- (4,0): All oranges in one group, none in the other. There is only 1 way to do this because the oranges are identical.\n- (3,1): Three oranges in one group, one in the other. Since the oranges are identical, it doesn't matter which orange is in the smaller group, so there is only 1 way to do this.\nThere are 2 scenarios for distributing the oranges into 2 groups.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the distribution for 3 groups\nFor 3 groups, we also have several possibilities:\n- (3,1,0): Three oranges in one group, one in another, and none in the third. There is only 1 way to do this since the oranges are identical.\n- (2,2,0): Two oranges in two separate groups, and none in the third. Again, since the oranges are identical, there's only 1 way to make each distinct pair.\n- (2,1,1): Two oranges in one group, and one orange in each of the other two groups. The oranges in the two-group are indistinguishable as are the oranges in the two single-group. This results in 3 permutations (2-1-1, 1-2-1, 1-1-2) but considering the indistinguishability of the oranges, we only count each distribution once.\nThere are 3 scenarios for distributing the oranges into 3 groups.\n\n## Step 6: Add the total number of ways for each number of groups\nTo find the total number of ways, we add the ways from each scenario: 1 way for 1 group, 2 ways for 2 groups, and 3 ways for 3 groups.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total\nTotal ways = 1 (for 1 group) + 2 (for 2 groups) + 3 (for 3 groups) = 6\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
