    "problem": "An airline serves a dinner to all the passengers on an airplane. They get their choice of steak or fish. Three steak meals and three fish meals are set aside for the six-member crew. If the meals are distributed to the crew members randomly, what is the probability that both pilots get the fish?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose 2 of the 6 meals for the pilots. There are $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways to choose 2 of the 3 fish meals. So the probability is $3/15 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to distribute the meals to the crew members.\nThere are 6 crew members and 6 meals set aside for them. The first crew member can choose any of the 6 meals, the second crew member can choose any of the remaining 5 meals, the third crew member can choose any of the remaining 4 meals, the fourth crew member can choose any of the remaining 3 meals, the fifth crew member can choose any of the remaining 2 meals, and the sixth crew member will be left with the last meal. Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the meals is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 6!.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways both pilots can get the fish.\nThere are 3 fish meals set aside for the crew. For both pilots to get the fish, we first need to choose 2 fish meals out of the 3 available fish meals for the pilots, which can be done in 3C2 = 3 ways. Then, out of the 3 remaining steak meals, we need to distribute one to each of the remaining 4 crew members. This can be done in 3P4 = 3! ways.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of ways both pilots can get the fish.\nFrom Step 2, we know that there are 3 ways to choose the 2 fish meals for the pilots and 3! ways to distribute the steak meals to the remaining crew members. Therefore, the total number of ways both pilots can get the fish is 3 * 3!.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that both pilots get the fish.\nThe probability that both pilots get the fish is the total number of ways both pilots can get the fish divided by the total number of ways to distribute the meals. Therefore, the probability is (3 * 3!) / 6!.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression.\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720. 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6. Therefore, (3 * 3!) = 18. So, (3 * 3!) / 6! = 18 / 720 = 1 / 40.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{40}}$"
