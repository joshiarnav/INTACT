    "problem": "A 6-sided die is weighted so that the probability of any number being rolled is proportional to the value of the roll.  (So, for example, the probability of a 2 being rolled is twice that of a 1 being rolled.)  What is the expected value of a roll of this weighted die?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the probability that a 1 is rolled.  Then the probability that a 2 is rolled is $2x$, the probability that a 3 is rolled is $3x$, and so on.  Since the sum of all these probabilities must be 1, we have that $x + 2x + \\cdots + 6x = 1$, which means that $21x = 1$, so $x = \\frac{1}{21}$.  Therefore \\[ E = \\frac{1}{21}(1) + \\frac{2}{21}(2) + \\cdots + \\frac{6}{21}(6) = \\frac{1^2 + 2^2 + \\cdots 6^2}{21} = \\boxed{\\frac{13}{3}}. \\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the probability of each outcome\nSince the probability of any number being rolled is proportional to the value of the roll, we can let the probability of rolling a 1 be x, the probability of rolling a 2 be 2x, and so on, up to the probability of rolling a 6 being 6x.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the value of x\nThe total probability of all outcomes must equal 1, so we can set up the equation x + 2x + 3x + 4x + 5x + 6x = 1. Simplifying this, we get 21x = 1.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for x\nDividing both sides of the equation by 21, we find that x = 1/21.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the expected value\nThe expected value is the sum of each outcome's value multiplied by its probability. For this die, the expected value E is given by E = (1)(x) + (2)(2x) + (3)(3x) + (4)(4x) + (5)(5x) + (6)(6x).\n\n## Step 5: Plug in the value of x\nSubstituting the value of x into the formula, we get E = (1)(1/21) + (2)(2/21) + (3)(3/21) + (4)(4/21) + (5)(5/21) + (6)(6/21).\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression\nCombining the fractions, we get E = 1/21 + 4/21 + 9/21 + 16/21 + 25/21 + 36/21.\n\n## Step 7: Add the fractions\nAdding the numerators, we get E = 91/21.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the fraction\nSince 91 and 21 are both multiples of 7, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 7, giving E = 13/3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{13}{3}}$"
