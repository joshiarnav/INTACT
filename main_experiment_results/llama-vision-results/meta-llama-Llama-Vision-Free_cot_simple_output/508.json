    "problem": "In how many ways can 6 girls and 2 boys sit in a row if the 2 boys insist on sitting next to each other?",
    "solution": "We can consider the two boys as one person, arrange the ``seven'' people first, then arrange the 2 boys.  So the number of seating arrangements in which the boys sit together is $7!\\times 2!=\\boxed{10,\\!080}$.",
    "total_tokens": 253,
    "time_taken": 40.1373507976532,
    "file_name": "./MATH/test/counting_and_probability/508.json",
    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Consider the 2 boys as a single entity\nSince the 2 boys insist on sitting next to each other, we can treat them as a single entity for the initial arrangement.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of entities\nThere are 6 girls and 1 entity of 2 boys, making a total of 7 entities.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the entities\nThe 7 entities can be arranged in a row in 7! = 5040 ways.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways the boys can sit\nWithin the single entity of 2 boys, there are 2! = 2 ways for the boys to sit next to each other.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of ways\nMultiply the number of ways to arrange the entities by the number of ways the boys can sit: 5040 * 2 = 10080.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10080}$"
