    "problem": "Steve has one quarter, two nickels and three pennies. Assuming no items are free, for how many different-priced items could Steve individually pay for with exact change?",
    "solution": "Steve can use no quarters or one quarter, for two possibilities.\n\nSteve can use 0, 1, or 2 nickels, for three possibilities.\n\nAnd Steve can use 0, 1, 2, or 3 pennies, for four possibilities.  That gives $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 = 24$ possible combinations.  But we must remove the combination where Steve does not use any coins, leaving us with $24 - 1 = \\boxed{23}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total value of each type of coin Steve has.\nSteve has 1 quarter, which is worth $0.25. He has 2 nickels, which are worth $0.05 * 2 = $0.10. He has 3 pennies, which are worth $0.01 * 3 = $0.03.\n\n## Step 2: Find the total value of all the coins combined.\nThe total value of Steve's coins is $0.25 + $0.10 + $0.03 = $0.38.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the possible combinations of coins that can form different-priced items.\nWe need to find all the possible combinations of coins that can add up to different values below $0.38. We can start by using the quarter, then the quarter and a nickel, then the quarter and two nickels, then the quarter and a nickel and a penny, and so on.\n\n## Step 4: List all the possible combinations of coins that can form different-priced items.\n- $0.25 (quarter)\n- $0.30 (quarter and a nickel)\n- $0.35 (quarter and two nickels)\n- $0.36 (quarter, nickel, and a penny)\n- $0.10 (two nickels)\n- $0.05 (one nickel)\n- $0.04 (two pennies)\n- $0.03 (three pennies)\n- $0.07 (five pennies)\n- $0.08 is not possible with the given coins.\n- $0.09 (six pennies)\n- $0.01 (one penny)\n\n## Step 5: Count the number of different-priced items that can be formed.\nThere are 11 different-priced items that can be formed.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$"
