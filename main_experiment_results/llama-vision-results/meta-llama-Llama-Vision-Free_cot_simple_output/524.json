    "solution": "There are two paths from A to B: A to K to B, and A to J to B.  The probability that a log will go from A to K to B is the probability that it will choose the middle flume initially times the probability that it will choose the flume to the right given that it chose the middle flume initially: $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\frac{1}{6}$.  Similarly, the probability that the log will go from A to J to B is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{9}$.  In total, the probability that the log reaches B is $\\dfrac{1}{6}+\\dfrac{1}{9}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the probability that a log in pond $A$ will end up in pond $B$. To approach this, we first need to understand the flow of logs through the system of ponds and flumes.\n## Step 2:  The given diagram represents the ponds and the direction of the flow of logs. Logs leave pond $A$ and float down flumes to eventually end up in pond $B$ or pond $C$. The flow of logs is restricted to the direction of the arrows on the flumes.\n## Step 3:  Let's consider a log starting from pond $A$. It has three exit options: the flume leading to pond $J$, the flume leading to pond $K$, and the flume leading to the central pond.\n## Step 4:  Considering each of these exit options, we can calculate the probability of a log ending up in pond $B$.\n## Step 5:  If the log enters pond $J$, it must then use one of the two exits leading from pond $J$ to $B$ or $K$. Since the log is equally likely to use any available exit flume, the probability of it ending up in pond $B$ is $1/2$.\n## Step 6:  If the log enters pond $K$, it must then use the single exit leading from pond $K$ to $A$ or $B$.\n## Step 7:  However, we can see from the diagram that the exit from pond $K$ to $A$ is not present, meaning that the only possible exit from pond $K$ is to $B$. This gives a probability of $1$.\n## Step 8:  Now, let's consider the log entering the central pond. There are three exits from this central pond to $A$, $B$, or $C$.\n## Step 9:  By symmetry, each exit has the same probability of being chosen. Since the log must eventually reach pond $B$, we can apply the principle of symmetry to conclude that the probability of it reaching pond $B$ from the central pond is $1/3$.\n## Step 10:  With these probabilities determined, we can calculate the overall probability of a log in pond $A$ ending up in pond $B$ by considering all the possible paths it can take.\n## Step 11:  This involves calculating the combined probabilities of entering ponds $J$ and $K$, and then using the determined probabilities for each of these cases to find the overall probability.\n## Step 12:  The detailed calculation of the combined probabilities will be presented in the next steps.\n\n## Step 13:  Now, let's calculate the probability of a log in pond $A$ ending up in pond $B$.\n## Step 14:  First, we consider a log starting from pond $A$. It has three exit options: the flume leading to pond $J$, the flume leading to pond $K$, and the flume leading to the central pond.\n## Step 15:  From pond $J$, the log has a probability of $1/2$ to end up in pond $B$, and from pond $K$, it has a probability of $1$ to end up in pond $B$.\n## Step 16:  Now, let's consider the log entering the central pond. There are three exits from this central pond to $A$, $B$, or $C$. By symmetry, each exit has the same probability of being chosen.\n## Step 17:  Since the log must eventually reach pond $B$, we can apply the principle of symmetry to conclude that the probability of it reaching pond $B$ from the central pond is $1/3$.\n## Step 18:  Now, let's calculate the combined probabilities of entering ponds $J$ and $K$. The probability of entering pond $J$ is $1/3$, and the probability of entering pond $K$ is also $1/3$. The remaining probability of $1/3$ corresponds to entering the central pond.\n## Step 19:  Using these probabilities, we can calculate the overall probability of a log in pond $A$ ending up in pond $B$.\n## Step 20:  The overall probability is the sum of the probabilities of entering ponds $J$ and $K$ and then ending up in pond $B$, and the probability of entering the central pond and then ending up in pond $B$.\n## Step 21:  Therefore, the overall probability is given by $(1/3)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (1/3)(1) + (1/3)(1/3)$.\n## Step 22:  Simplifying this expression, we get $(1/6) + (1/3) + (1/9) = (3 + 6 + 2)/18 = 11/18$.\n\n## Step 23:  Therefore, the probability that a log in pond $A$ will end up in pond $B$ is $\\frac{11}{18}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{18}}$"
