    "problem": "In how many ways can $7$ people sit around a round table if no two of the $3$ people Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other? (Seating arrangements which are rotations of each other are treated as the same.)",
    "solution": "After Pierre sits, we can place Rosa either two seats from Pierre (that is, with one seat between them) or three seats from Pierre. We tackle these two cases separately:\n\nCase 1: Rosa is two seats from Pierre. There are $2$ such seats. For either of these, there are then four empty seats in a row, and one empty seat between Rosa and Pierre. Thomas can sit in either of the middle two of the four empty seats in a row. So, there are $2\\cdot 2 = 4$ ways to seat Rosa and Thomas in this case. There are then $4$ seats left, which the others can take in $4! = 24$ ways. So, there are $4\\cdot 24 = 96$ seatings in this case.\n\nCase 2: Rosa is three seats from Pierre (that is, there are $2$ seats between them). There are $2$ such seats. Thomas can't sit in either of the $2$ seats directly between them, but after Rosa sits, there are $3$ empty seats in a row still, and Thomas can only sit in the middle seat of these three. Once again, there are $4$ empty seats remaining, and the $4$ remaining people can sit in them in $4! = 24$ ways. So, we have $2\\cdot 24 = 48$ seatings in this case.\n\nPutting our two cases together gives a total of $96+48 = \\boxed{144}$ seatings.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, we consider the total number of ways 7 people can sit around a round table without any restrictions.\nThere are 6 positions around the table. If we were to arrange the 7 people in a line, there would be 7! ways to do it. But since we're arranging them around a circle, we need to divide by the number of rotations that would result in the same arrangement. There are 7 rotations, so we divide by 7. Therefore, the total number of unique seating arrangements without restrictions is (7-1)! = 6! = 720.\n\n## Step 2: Now, we need to find the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other.\nWe can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit, reducing the number of \"people\" to 5. These 5 units can be arranged around the table in (5-1)! = 4! = 24 ways.\n\n## Step 3: Within the unit of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas, there are 3! ways to arrange the 3 people.\nSo, for each of the 24 arrangements of the 5 units, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit.\n\n## Step 4: We also need to consider the number of ways to arrange the remaining 4 people around the table.\nThis can be done in 4! = 24 ways.\n\n## Step 5: Therefore, the total number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other is 24 * 6 * 24 = 3456.\nThis is the total number of seating arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are not separated.\n\n## Step 6: Now, we subtract the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other from the total number of arrangements without restrictions.\nThis will give us the number of seating arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are separated by at least one person.\n\n## Step 7: The number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are separated by at least one person is therefore 720 - 3456 = -2736.\nThis cannot be correct, as we are counting a negative number of arrangements.\n\n## Step 8: There seems to be an error in the above steps, since we cannot have a negative number of arrangements.\nLet's re-evaluate the steps to find the correct number of arrangements.\n\n## Step 9: We realize that the error is in the calculation of the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other.\nThe correct calculation is 24 * 6 = 144 ways to arrange the 5 units and the 3 people within their unit, but we need to consider that within each of these 144 arrangements, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.\n\n## Step 10: However, within the 144 arrangements of the 5 units and Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas, we can also permute the 3 people Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas in 3! ways, so the correct count for the number of ways the 3 people can sit next to each other is actually 24 * 6 * 3! = 24 * 6 * 6 = 864.\n\n## Step 11: Now, we subtract the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other from the total number of arrangements without restrictions.\nThis will give us the number of seating arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are separated by at least one person.\n\n## Step 12: The number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are separated by at least one person is therefore 720 - 864 = -144.\nThis is still not correct. We need to rethink the calculation.\n\n## Step 13: We need to find a different approach to solve this problem.\nWe can consider seating the 3 people Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas first and then placing the remaining 4 people around the table.\n\n## Step 14: There are 4 spots for Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas to sit in such a way that they are not next to each other.\nThese 4 spots are the 4 gaps between the remaining 4 people.\n\n## Step 15: Once the 3 people Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are seated, the remaining 4 people can be arranged around the table in 4! = 24 ways.\n\n## Step 16: Therefore, the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are separated by at least one person is 4 * 24 = 96.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{96}$"
