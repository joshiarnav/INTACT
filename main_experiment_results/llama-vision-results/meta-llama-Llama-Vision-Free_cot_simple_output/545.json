    "problem": "How many subsets of the set of divisors of $72$ contain only composite numbers? For example, $\\{8,9\\}$ and $\\{4,8,12\\}$ are two such sets. Include the empty set in your count.",
    "solution": "We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \\cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Find the divisors of 72.\nFirst, we need to find all the divisors of 72. The divisors of 72 are the numbers that divide 72 without leaving a remainder. We can list them out: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the composite numbers among the divisors.\nFrom the list of divisors, we need to identify the composite numbers. Composite numbers are the numbers that have more than two factors. In our list, the composite numbers are: 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of subsets that can be formed using the composite numbers.\nThe total number of subsets that can be formed using the composite numbers is 2^n, where n is the number of composite numbers. In this case, we have 9 composite numbers, so the total number of subsets is 2^9 = 512.\n\n## Step 4: Exclude the subsets that contain the number 1.\nWe need to exclude the subsets that contain the number 1 because the problem states that the subsets should contain only composite numbers. Since the number 1 is not composite, we need to exclude all subsets that contain it. The number of subsets that contain 1 is equal to the total number of subsets of the remaining 8 composite numbers, which is 2^8 = 256.\n\n## Step 5: Find the total number of subsets that contain only composite numbers.\nTo find the total number of subsets that contain only composite numbers, we need to subtract the number of subsets that contain 1 from the total number of subsets. Therefore, the total number of subsets that contain only composite numbers is 512 - 256 = 256.\n\n## Step 6: Include the empty set in the count.\nWe need to include the empty set in the count. The empty set is also a subset that contains only composite numbers, so we need to add 1 to our total count.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the final answer.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{257}$"
