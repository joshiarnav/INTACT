    "problem": "Determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word MISSISSIPPI.",
    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $11!$. Then since the I's, S's and the P's are not unique, we divide by $4!$, $4!$, and $2!$ for the arrangements of I's, S's, and P's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{11!}{4! \\times 4! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{34,\\!650}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Identify the total number of letters in the word MISSISSIPPI.\nThe word MISSISSIPPI has 11 letters.\n\n## Step 2:  Determine the number of repetitions for each letter in the word.\nM is repeated 4 times, I is repeated 4 times, S is repeated 4 times, and P is repeated 2 times.\n\n## Step 3:  Calculate the total number of arrangements without considering repetitions.\nIf all letters were unique, the total arrangements would be 11!.\n\n## Step 4:  Account for the repetitions in the arrangements.\nSince there are repetitions, the arrangements need to be adjusted by dividing by the factorial of the number of repetitions for each letter.\n\n## Step 5:  Calculate the adjustment for each type of repetition.\nThere are 4 Ms, 4 Is, 4 Ss, and 2 Ps, so we divide by 4! for each type of letter.\n\n## Step 6:  Apply the formula to calculate the total arrangements considering the repetitions.\nThe formula for permutations with repetitions is the total number of letters factorial divided by the product of each type of letter's factorial. For MISSISSIPPI, this is 11! / (4! * 4! * 4! * 2!).\n\n## Step 7:  Simplify the expression to calculate the final number of arrangements.\n11! = 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 39,916,800\n4! = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24\n2! = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\nSo, the calculation is 39,916,800 / (24 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 2).\n\n## Step 8:  Complete the calculation.\nFirst, calculate the denominator: 24 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 24 = 13824, and then 13824 * 2 = 27648.\nThen, divide 39,916,800 by 27648.\n\n## Step 9:  Final calculation step.\n39,916,800 / 27648 = 1440.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1440}$"
