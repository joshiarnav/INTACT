    "problem": "Five 6-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show a 1 or a 2?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which of the five dice show a 1 or 2. The probability of any one of these occurring is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{\\!3}$. So the overall probability is $$10\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{\\!3}=\\frac{10\\times 2^3}{3^5}=\\boxed{\\frac{80}{243}}.$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the probability of a single die showing a 1 or a 2\nThe probability of a single die showing a 1 or a 2 is 2/6, because there are 2 favorable outcomes (1 and 2) out of 6 possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of exactly two dice showing a 1 or a 2\nWe can choose which two dice show a 1 or a 2 in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ different ways.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of the chosen dice showing a 1 or a 2 and the other dice not showing a 1 or a 2\nFor each of the 10 ways of choosing which two dice show a 1 or a 2, the probability that the chosen dice actually roll a 1 or a 2 and the other dice roll something else is $\\left(\\frac{2}{6}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{4}{6}\\right)^3=\\frac{32}{729}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the overall probability by multiplying the number of ways by the probability of each way\nThe overall probability is $10\\cdot \\frac{32}{729}=\\frac{320}{729}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{320}{729}}$"
