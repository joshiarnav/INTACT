    "problem": "Carson flips over the cards of a standard 52-card deck one at a time. What is the probability that he flips over the ace of spades before any face card (jack, queen or king)?",
    "solution": "There are 12 face cards, three from each suit. Within the deck, the 13 relevant cards (the face cards and the ace of spades) are arranged in some order. The probability that the first of these 13 cards is the ace is therefore $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{13}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of cards in a standard deck\nA standard deck contains 52 cards.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the face cards in a standard deck\nThere are 3 face cards for each suit: jack, queen, and king. With 4 suits, that makes a total of 3 * 4 = 12 face cards.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the ace of spades in the deck\nThere is only 1 ace of spades in the deck.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of face cards, including the ace of spades\nSince the ace of spades is also a face card, we add it to the total of face cards, making it 12 + 1 = 13 face cards.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the order of drawing cards\nThe order matters here because we want the ace of spades before any face card. This makes it a problem of permutations where the order of drawing is important.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of drawing the ace of spades first\nTo draw the ace of spades before any face card, it must be drawn first. The probability of drawing the ace of spades first is 1 out of 52 because there is only 1 ace of spades in a deck of 52 cards.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability of drawing any face card next\nIf the ace of spades is drawn first, there are now 51 cards left, and 13 of them are face cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing any face card next is 13 out of 51.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the combined probability of both events\nHowever, since we're considering the entire process, we must also account for the scenario where the ace of spades is not drawn first. But for the specific question of probability asked, it seems we are only looking at the scenario where the ace of spades is drawn before any face card, which does not need to consider the rest of the deck as a whole. Thus, we directly calculate the probability of the ace of spades being drawn first and then any face card being drawn next.\n\nThe probability of drawing the ace of spades first is 1/52, and the probability of drawing any face card next is 13/51. Therefore, the combined probability is (1/52) * (13/51).\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the expression for combined probability\n(1/52) * (13/51) = 13/(52*51) = 13/2652.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the fraction further if possible\n13/2652 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1 (since 13 and 2652 share no common factors other than 1). So, 13/2652 is already in its simplest form.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{13}{2652}}$"
