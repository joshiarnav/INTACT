    "problem": "If $a,$ $b$ and $c$ are three (not necessarily different) numbers chosen randomly and with replacement from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\},$ what is the probability that $ab+c$ is even?",
    "solution": "The quantity $ab+c$ is even if and only if $ab$ and $c$ are both odd or both even. The probability that $c$ is odd is $\\frac{3}{5},$ and the probability that $ab$ is odd is $\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{25}$ (because both $a$ and $b$ must be odd). Therefore, the probability that $ab+c$ is even is \\[\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} + \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{9}{25}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{59}{125}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To determine the probability that $ab+c$ is even, we need to consider all the possible combinations of $a,$ $b,$ and $c.$ Since $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are chosen randomly and with replacement from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\},$ there are $5$ possible choices for each of $a,$ $b,$ and $c.$\n\n## Step 2: In order for $ab+c$ to be even, we need $c$ to be even. This is because the product of $a$ and $b$ can be either even or odd, but adding an odd number $c$ to it would make it odd. Therefore, $c$ must be even for $ab+c$ to be even.\n\n## Step 3: Given that there are $5$ choices for each of $a,$ $b,$ and $c,$ there are a total of $5^3=125$ possible combinations of $a,$ $b,$ and $c.$\n\n## Step 4: Now, we need to determine the number of combinations where $ab+c$ is even. Since $c$ must be even for $ab+c$ to be even, we only need to consider the cases where $c$ is even.\n\n## Step 5: There are $2$ even numbers in the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\},$ which are $2$ and $4.$ Therefore, there are $2$ choices for $c.$\n\n## Step 6: For each of the $2$ choices of $c,$ there are $5$ choices for $a$ and $5$ choices for $b.$\n\n## Step 7: This gives us a total of $2\\cdot5\\cdot5=50$ combinations where $c$ is even.\n\n## Step 8: Since there are $50$ combinations where $c$ is even, the probability that $ab+c$ is even is given by $\\frac{50}{125}.$\n\n## Step 9: Simplifying the fraction, we get $\\frac{2}{5}.$\n\n## Step 10: Therefore, the probability that $ab+c$ is even is $\\frac{2}{5}.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$"
