    "problem": "How many (non-congruent) isosceles triangles exist which have a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the measure of the each of the equal sides.  Since the perimeter is 10 units, the side lengths measure $x$, $x$, and $10-2x$ units.  Since the third side length must be positive, we have $10-2x>0$ which implies $x<5$.  By the triangle inequality, the sum of the two equal sides must exceed the third side.  Solving  $x+x>10-2x$ gives $x>2.5$.  There are $\\boxed{2}$ integers strictly between 2.5 and 5.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Let's first understand what an isosceles triangle is.\nAn isosceles triangle is a triangle with two sides of equal length.\n\n## Step 2: The perimeter of the triangle is given as 10, and the side lengths must be integers.\nLet's denote the two equal sides as 'x' and the base as 'y'. Therefore, we have the equation: x + x + y = 10, which simplifies to 2x + y = 10.\n\n## Step 3: Since the side lengths must be integers, we need to find all integer combinations of x and y that satisfy the equation 2x + y = 10.\nTo find these combinations, we can start with the smallest possible value of x (which is 1) and find the corresponding value of y, and then increase x by 1 and find the new value of y until x is less than half of 10 (the largest possible integer value for x).\n\n## Step 4: Let's list the possible combinations of x and y that satisfy the equation 2x + y = 10.\n- x = 1, y = 8\n- x = 2, y = 6\n- x = 3, y = 4\n- x = 4, y = 2\n- x = 5, y = 0\n\n## Step 5: Now, we need to check if all these combinations form valid isosceles triangles.\nA valid triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. For isosceles triangles, this means that the base must be less than the sum of the other two sides, and the two equal sides must be greater than the base.\n\n## Step 6: Checking the combinations obtained in step 4 against the triangle inequality theorem.\n- For (x = 1, y = 8), the inequality holds (1 + 1 > 8 is not true, so this is not a valid triangle).\n- For (x = 2, y = 6), the inequality holds (2 + 2 > 6 is true).\n- For (x = 3, y = 4), the inequality holds (3 + 3 > 4 is true).\n- For (x = 4, y = 2), the inequality holds (4 + 4 > 2 is true).\n- For (x = 5, y = 0), the inequality does not hold (5 + 5 \u2264 0 is not true, but rather 5 + 5 > 0 is true, however 5 + 0 < 5 is not true, so this is not a valid triangle).\n\n## Step 7: Now, let's count the number of valid isosceles triangles found in step 6.\nWe have 3 valid isosceles triangles: (x = 2, y = 6), (x = 3, y = 4), and (x = 4, y = 2).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
