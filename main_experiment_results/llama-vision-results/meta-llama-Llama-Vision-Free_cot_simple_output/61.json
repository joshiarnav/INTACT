    "problem": "If two numbers are randomly chosen without replacement from $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, what is the probability their sum is greater than their product? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers.  Observe that $ab-(a+b)=(a-1)(b-1)-1$.  This quantity is non-negative unless either $a$ or $b$ equals 1.  Therefore, the only pairs of positive integers for which the sum exceeds the product are those of the form $\\{1,n\\}$ where $n$ is a positive integer.  In this case, there are 4 such pairs: $\\{1,2\\}$, $\\{1,3\\}$, $\\{1,4\\}$, and $\\{1,5\\}$.  There are a total of $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ pairs of integers, so the probability that the sum exceeds the product is $\\frac{4}{10}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the total number of outcomes when two numbers are chosen without replacement from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\nThere are 5 choices for the first number and 4 choices for the second number, since the numbers are chosen without replacement. So, the total number of outcomes is $5 \\times 4 = 20$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the cases where the sum of two numbers is greater than their product.\nLet's consider all possible pairs of numbers from the given set and determine when their sum is greater than their product.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate all possible pairs and their sums and products:\n- (1, 2): sum = 3, product = 2, sum > product\n- (1, 3): sum = 4, product = 3, sum > product\n- (1, 4): sum = 5, product = 4, sum > product\n- (1, 5): sum = 6, product = 5, sum > product\n- (2, 3): sum = 5, product = 6, sum < product\n- (2, 4): sum = 6, product = 8, sum < product\n- (2, 5): sum = 7, product = 10, sum < product\n- (3, 4): sum = 7, product = 12, sum < product\n- (3, 5): sum = 8, product = 15, sum < product\n- (4, 5): sum = 9, product = 20, sum < product\n\n## Step 4: Count the total number of favorable outcomes.\nFrom the evaluation in Step 3, we see that 5 pairs have a sum greater than their product.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability.\nThe probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{5}{20} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$"
