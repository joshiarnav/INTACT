    "solution": "There are nine possible products, as there are three different numbers upon which the first spinner could land and three different numbers upon which the second spinner could land. If the first spinner lands on $-3$ or $-1$, the second spinner can land on either 2 or 4 to create a negative product, giving four possibilities. If the first spinner lands on the 5, the second spinner must land on the $-6$ to create a negative product. Thus, there are five possible ways to create a negative product, so the probability that the product of the values is negative is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the probability that the product of the two values is negative, we need to consider the different combinations of values that will result in a negative product.\n## Step 2: Since the product of two numbers is negative if one number is positive and the other is negative, we need to count the number of combinations where one spinner lands on a positive number and the other lands on a negative number.\n## Step 3: We can see from the diagram that the first spinner has numbers 1, 2, and 3, and the second spinner has numbers -6, 4, and 2.\n## Step 4: There are three negative numbers on the second spinner, and three positive numbers on the first spinner.\n## Step 5: Therefore, the total number of combinations where one spinner lands on a positive number and the other lands on a negative number is 3 x 3 = 9.\n## Step 6: The total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of options on each spinner, which is 3 x 3 = 9.\n## Step 7: Since there are 9 favorable outcomes (combinations where the product is negative) out of a total of 9 possible outcomes, the probability of the product being negative is 9/9 = 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$"
