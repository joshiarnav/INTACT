    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are tasked with finding the number of paths from point $C$ to point $B$ on a grid, where each step must be either up or to the right.\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, let's first understand the total number of steps required to reach point $B$ from point $C$. The point $C$ is located at $(1, 2)$, and point $B$ is at $(5, 4)$. This means we need to take a total of $3$ steps up and $4$ steps to the right to reach point $B$ from point $C$.\n## Step 3:  Therefore, we have a total of $7$ steps, out of which we need to choose $3$ steps to be up (and the remaining $4$ steps will naturally be to the right).\n## Step 4:  This is a combination problem, as the order of the steps does not matter. We can use the combination formula, denoted as $\\binom{n}{r}$, which gives the number of ways to choose $r$ items from a set of $n$ items without considering the order.\n## Step 5:  In this case, we want to find the number of combinations of $7$ steps taken $3$ at a time, which is calculated as $\\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35$.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, there are $35$ paths from point $C$ to point $B$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{35}$"
