    "problem": "Maria has three identical apples and three identical oranges. How many ways are there for her to distribute the fruits among her four friends if she doesn't give Jacky any oranges?  (Note: Maria takes none of the fruit herself, and some of her friends might not receive any fruit at all.)",
    "solution": "First, just consider the apples. Imagine putting three dividers among the apples, so that Maria's first friend gets the apples to the left of the first divider, Maria's second friend gets the apples between the first and second dividers, Maria's third friend gets the apples between the second and third dividers, and Maria's last friend gets the apples after the third divider. With three dividers and three apples, there are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to arrange the dividers. Now, consider the oranges. Since Maria won't give Jacky any oranges, Maria has to distribute the oranges among her other three friends. With three oranges and two dividers, there are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways for Maria to distribute the oranges. The total number of ways for Maria to distribute the fruit is $20\\cdot 10=\\boxed{200}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the constraints for distributing the fruits.\nMaria has three identical apples and three identical oranges. She cannot give any oranges to Jacky.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the ways to distribute the oranges.\nSince Maria cannot give any oranges to Jacky, she has to give all the oranges to the remaining three friends. This means we need to find the number of ways to distribute three identical items (oranges) among three distinct people.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to distribute the oranges.\nThis is a stars-and-bars problem, where we are distributing three identical objects into three distinct bins. The number of ways to do this is given by the formula $\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$, where n is the number of objects and k is the number of bins. Here, n=3 (three oranges) and k=3 (three friends), so the number of ways to distribute the oranges is $\\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = 10$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the ways to distribute the apples.\nAfter distributing the oranges, we are left with three identical apples to be distributed among all four friends, including Jacky. We can give 0, 1, 2, or 3 apples to Jacky, and the remaining apples will be distributed among the other three friends. This is also a stars-and-bars problem.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to distribute the apples.\nSince there are three apples and four friends, we can distribute them in four different ways:\n- All three apples go to one friend, which can happen in 4 ways.\n- Two apples go to one friend and one apple goes to another friend, which can happen in 4 x 3 = 12 ways.\n- One apple goes to each of the four friends, which can happen in 4 ways.\n- One apple goes to one friend and the other two apples go to another friend, which can happen in 4 x 3 = 12 ways.\nHowever, since the apples are identical, we need to account for overcounting. There is only one way to give 0 apples to Jacky and distribute the three apples among the other three friends. There is only one way to give 3 apples to Jacky and give 0 apples to the other friends. Therefore, we can only count each of these cases once. So the number of ways to distribute the apples is 4 + 12 + 4 + 12 = 32.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of ways to distribute the fruits.\nWe multiply the number of ways to distribute the oranges by the number of ways to distribute the apples: 10 * 32 = 320.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{320}$"
