    "problem": "A 12-slice pizza was made with only pepperoni and mushroom toppings, and every slice has at least one topping. Only five slices have pepperoni, and exactly eight slices have mushrooms. How many slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms?",
    "solution": "There are 12 total slices, and 5 of them have pepperoni and 8 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number that have both toppings. So, there are $5-n$ slices with only pepperoni and $8-n$ with only mushrooms.  So, there are a total of $n + (5-n) + (8-n)$ slices.  Since there are 12 slices, we have $(5-n) + (8-n) + n = 12$, from which we find that $n=\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. There are 12 slices in total.\n2. Every slice has at least one topping.\n3. Only 5 slices have pepperoni.\n4. Exactly 8 slices have mushrooms.\n\nWe want to find out how many slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms.\n\nLet's use a Venn diagram to visualize the situation:\n\n**Pepperoni** | **Mushroom** | **Neither**\n---------|---------|---------\n x       |         |         (5)\n         |  x      |         (8)\n         |         |         (0) (we know there are 0 slices with neither topping)\n\nWe know that the total number of slices with pepperoni is 5. Let's call the number of slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms \"x\". Then, the number of slices with only pepperoni is 5 - x.\n\nSimilarly, the total number of slices with mushrooms is 8. Let's call the number of slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms \"x\" again. Then, the number of slices with only mushrooms is 8 - x.\n\nNow, we know that the total number of slices is 12. We can write an equation:\n\n(5 - x) + (8 - x) + x = 12\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n13 - x = 12\n\nSubtracting 13 from both sides, we get:\n\n-x = -1\n\nMultiplying both sides by -1, we get:\n\nx = 1\n\nSo, there is **1** slice that has both pepperoni and mushrooms."
