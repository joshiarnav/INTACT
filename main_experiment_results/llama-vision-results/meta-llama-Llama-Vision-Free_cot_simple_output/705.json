    "problem": "Mr. Cole needs to select 3 girls and 5 boys to go on a backpacking trip. In how many ways can he do this if 6 girls and 11 boys are interested in going on the trip?",
    "solution": "In this problem, Mr. Cole is really selecting two separate groups.  He can choose 3 girls from the 6 girls total in $$ \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20 $$ways, and 5 boys from the 11 boys total in $$ \\binom{11}{5} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 462 $$ways.  Since these two selections are independent (since for each of the 20 ways to pick the girls, there are 462 ways to pick the boys), we multiply them together to get the number of ways that we can form the 8-member trip: $$ \\binom{6}{3}\\binom{11}{5} = (20)(462) = \\boxed{9,\\!240}. $$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to select 3 girls from 6 interested girls.\nTo find the number of ways to select 3 girls from 6, we use the combination formula \\(C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items, \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. For selecting 3 girls from 6, the formula becomes \\(C(6, 3) = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!}\\).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to select 3 girls from 6.\nWe calculate \\(C(6, 3) = \\frac{6!}{3!3!}\\). Since \\(6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720\\), \\(3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\\), and \\(3! = 6\\), we have \\(C(6, 3) = \\frac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to select 5 boys from 11 interested boys.\nUsing the same combination formula, we calculate the number of ways to select 5 boys from 11 as \\(C(11, 5) = \\frac{11!}{5!(11-5)!}\\).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to select 5 boys from 11.\nWe calculate \\(C(11, 5) = \\frac{11!}{5!6!}\\). Since \\(11! = 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 39,916,800\\), \\(5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\\), and \\(6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720\\), we have \\(C(11, 5) = \\frac{39,916,800}{120 \\times 720} = \\frac{39,916,800}{86,400} = 462\\).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of ways to select 3 girls and 5 boys.\nTo find the total number of ways to select 3 girls and 5 boys, we multiply the number of ways to select 3 girls by the number of ways to select 5 boys. This is because for each selection of 3 girls, there are as many selections of 5 boys as calculated in step 4.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of ways to select 3 girls and 5 boys.\nThe total number of ways is \\(20 \\times 462\\).\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the final result.\n\\(20 \\times 462 = 9,240\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9240}$"
