    "problem": "Mike draws five cards from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that he draws a card from at least three of the four suits? Express your answer as a simplified fraction.",
    "solution": "We calculate the probability that he does not draw a card from at least three of the suits. To do this, we calculate the number of sets of 5 cards from at most two suits and divide by $\\binom{52}5$, the number of sets of 5 cards. Since there are $\\binom42=6$ choices for the two suits, and $\\binom{26}5$ ways to choose 5 cards from the 26 in those two suits, our answer would appear to be $6\\binom{26}5$. But this triple-counts the ways to choose the cards from a single suit: 5 hearts is included in 5 (hearts and spades), 5 (hearts and clubs), and 5 (hearts and diamonds). So we subtract twice the number of ways to choose cards from a single suit: $6\\binom{26}5-2\\cdot4\\binom{13}5$. We divide this by $\\binom{52}5$ to get $$\\frac{6\\cdot26\\cdot25\\cdot24\\cdot23\\cdot22-8\\cdot13\\cdot12\\cdot11\\cdot10\\cdot9}{52\\cdot51\\cdot50\\cdot49\\cdot48}=\\frac{88}{595}.$$Therefore, the probability that he draws three or four of the suits is $1-\\frac{88}{595}=\\boxed{\\frac{507}{595}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the probability of drawing a card from at least three of the four suits when drawing five cards from a standard 52-card deck, we need to first understand the total number of possible outcomes and the number of successful outcomes.\n## Step 2: There are a total of $\\binom{52}{5}=\\frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!}=2,598,960$ ways to draw 5 cards from a 52-card deck.\n## Step 3: We will calculate the probability of drawing exactly 3 suits, then multiply by the number of combinations for each of those cases, then add it to the probability of drawing all 4 suits.\n## Step 4: To draw exactly 3 suits, we can choose 3 suits out of the 4 in $\\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways. Then, we can choose 3 cards out of the 13 in each of those suits in $\\binom{13}{3}=286$ ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to draw exactly 3 suits is $4 \\cdot 286=1144$.\n## Step 5: To draw exactly 4 suits, there is only one way to choose the 4 suits, and we choose 1 card out of 13 in each of those suits, so there are $\\binom{13}{1}^4=28,561$ ways to draw all 4 suits.\n## Step 6: Since these events are mutually exclusive, we can calculate the total number of successful outcomes as $1144+28,561=30,705$.\n## Step 7: Finally, we can calculate the probability as $\\frac{30,705}{2,598,960}=\\frac{3027}{25980}$"
