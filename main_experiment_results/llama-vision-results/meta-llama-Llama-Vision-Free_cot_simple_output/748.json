    "problem": "I have 7 books I want to arrange on a shelf. Two of them are math books, and one is a physics book. How many ways are there for me to arrange the books if I want to put the math books next to each other, and put both of them to the left of the physics book? (Note that all the books are distinguishable.)",
    "solution": "We can arrange the books on the shelf, pretending that the two math books are actually one book because they must be next to each other. In exactly half of these arrangements, the math books will be to the left of the physics book, giving $6!/2=360$ arrangements. However, in each of these arrangements there are two ways to arrange the math books, so the total number of arrangements is $360\\cdot2=\\boxed{720}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the constraints\nFirst, let's understand the constraints given in the problem. We have 7 books in total. Two of them are math books that must be placed next to each other, and one is a physics book that must be placed to the right of the two math books.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the math books as one unit\nTo simplify the problem, let's consider the two math books as one single unit. This effectively reduces the number of units we are arranging from 7 to 6 (the single math unit, the physics book, and the 5 remaining books).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the arrangements of the 6 units\nWe can now calculate the number of ways to arrange these 6 units. This is a straightforward permutation problem, where the number of arrangements is given by the factorial of the number of units. So, there are $6!$ ways to arrange the 6 units.\n\n## Step 4: Account for the arrangement of the math books\nHowever, within the single math unit, the two math books can themselves be arranged in two ways (since they are distinguishable). Therefore, for each of the arrangements of the 6 units, there are 2 ways to arrange the math books within their unit.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of arrangements\nTo find the total number of arrangements that satisfy the given conditions, we multiply the number of arrangements of the 6 units by the number of arrangements within the math unit. So, the total number of arrangements is $6! \\times 2$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the value of $6! \\times 2$\n$6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720$, and multiplying this by 2 gives us $720 \\times 2 = 1440$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1440}$"
