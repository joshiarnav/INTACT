    "problem": "When counting from $3$ to $201$, $53$ is the $51^\\mathrm{st}$ number counted. When counting backwards from $201$ to $3$, $53$ is the $n^\\mathrm{th}$ number counted. What is $n$?",
    "solution": "Note that $n$ is equal to the number of integers between $53$ and $201$, inclusive. Thus, $n=201-53+1=\\boxed{149}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the position of the number $53$ when counting backwards from $201$ to $3$, we need to understand the relationship between the position of $53$ when counting forward and its position when counting backward.\n## Step 2:  When counting from $3$ to $201$, $53$ is the $51^\\mathrm{st}$ number counted. This means that there are $50$ numbers between $3$ and $53$ when counting forward.\n## Step 3:  To find the number of numbers between $53$ and $201$ when counting forward, we can subtract $53$ from $201$ and then add $1$ to include both $53$ and $201$. This gives us $201 - 53 + 1 = 149$ numbers between $53$ and $201$ when counting forward.\n## Step 4:  When counting backward from $201$ to $3$, the total number of numbers in the sequence is $201 - 3 + 1 = 199$. Let's denote the number of numbers between $53$ and $201$ when counting backward as $n$. Since we need to count backwards, we can find the value of $n$ using the relationship $n = 199 - 149$.\n## Step 5:  We can then solve for $n$ to find its value when counting backward from $201$ to $3$.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, we can now calculate the value of $n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{50}$"
