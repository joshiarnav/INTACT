    "problem": "Our physics club has $20$ members, among which we have 3 officers: President, Vice President, and Treasurer.  However, one member, Alex, hates another member, Bob.  How many ways can we fill the offices if Alex refuses to serve as an officer if Bob is also an officer? (No person is allowed to hold more than one office.)",
    "solution": "The best way to approach this problem is to use complementary counting. We already know that there are $20 \\times 19 \\times 18$ ways to choose the 3 officers if we ignore the restriction about Alex and Bob.  So now we want to count the number of ways that both Alex and Bob serve as officers.\n\nFor this, we will use constructive counting.  We need to pick an office for Alex, then pick an office for Bob, then put someone in the last office.  We have 3 choices for an office for Alex, either President, VP, or Treasurer.  Once we pick an office for Alex, we have 2 offices left from which to choose an office for Bob.\n\nOnce we have both Alex and Bob installed in offices, we have 18 members left in the club to pick from for the remaining vacant office.  So there are $3 \\times 2 \\times 18$ ways to pick officers such that Alex and Bob are both in an office.  Remember that these are the cases that we want to exclude, so to finish the problem we subtract these cases from the total number of cases.  Hence the answer is: $$ (20 \\times 19 \\times 18) - (3 \\times 2 \\times 18) = ((20 \\times 19)-6) \\times 18 = 374 \\times 18 = \\boxed{6732}. $$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, we need to calculate the total number of ways to select the 3 officers from the 20 members without any restrictions.\nThere are 20 choices for President, 19 choices for Vice President (since one member is already chosen as President), and 18 choices for Treasurer. Thus, the total number of ways to select the 3 officers without any restrictions is $20 \\times 19 \\times 18$.\n\n## Step 2: Next, we need to determine the number of ways Alex and Bob could both be officers.\nWe need to consider the following cases:\n- Alex as President, Bob as Vice President, and any member as Treasurer (there are 17 choices for Treasurer)\n- Alex as Vice President, Bob as President, and any member as Treasurer (there are 17 choices for Treasurer)\n- Bob as President, Alex as Vice President, and any member as Treasurer (there are 17 choices for Treasurer)\n- Alex as Treasurer, Bob as President, and any member as Vice President (there are 17 choices for Vice President)\n- Alex as Treasurer, Bob as Vice President, and any member as President (there are 17 choices for President)\n- Alex as Treasurer, Bob as Treasurer is not allowed since there can only be one Treasurer, so we don't need to consider it\n\n## Step 3: We calculate the total number of ways Alex and Bob could both be officers.\nThe number of ways Alex and Bob could both be officers is $17 \\times 3$.\n\n## Step 4: Now, we calculate the total number of ways to select the 3 officers if Alex refuses to serve as an officer if Bob is also an officer.\nWe will subtract the number of ways Alex and Bob could both be officers from the total number of ways to select the 3 officers without any restrictions.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the values.\nTotal ways without restrictions: $20 \\times 19 \\times 18 = 6840$\nTotal ways Alex and Bob could both be officers: $17 \\times 3 = 51$\nSo, the total number of ways to select the 3 officers if Alex refuses to serve as an officer if Bob is also an officer is $6840 - 51 = 6789$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6789}$"
