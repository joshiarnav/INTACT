    "problem": "John rolls a pair of standard 6-sided dice. What is the probability that the two numbers he rolls are relatively prime? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We have to use a little bit of casework to solve this problem. If the first die shows a 1, the second die can be anything (6 cases). If the first die shows 2 or 4, the second die is limited to 1, 3, or 5 ($2\\cdot3 = 6$ cases). If the first die shows 3, the second die can be 1, 2, 4, or 5 (4 cases). If the first die shows 5, the second die can be anything but 5 (5 cases). If the first die shows 6, the second die can be only 1 or 5 (2 cases). There are 36 ways to roll two dice, 23 of which are valid, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{23}{36}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the total possible outcomes when rolling two 6-sided dice.\nWhen rolling two 6-sided dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the total number of outcomes for two dice is 6 * 6 = 36.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the pairs of numbers that are relatively prime.\nTwo numbers are relatively prime if they have no common positive divisors other than 1. For the pairs of numbers rolled by John, we need to identify which pairs meet this criterion. The pairs of numbers that are relatively prime are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,3), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (6,1).\n\n## Step 3: Count the number of pairs that are relatively prime.\nFrom Step 2, we have identified 16 pairs that are relatively prime.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of rolling two numbers that are relatively prime.\nTo find the probability, we divide the number of pairs that are relatively prime (found in Step 3) by the total number of possible outcomes (found in Step 1).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the final probability fraction.\nThe probability of rolling two numbers that are relatively prime is 16/36. This can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the fraction.\n16 divided by 4 is 4, and 36 divided by 4 is 9. Therefore, the fraction 16/36 simplifies to 4/9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$"
