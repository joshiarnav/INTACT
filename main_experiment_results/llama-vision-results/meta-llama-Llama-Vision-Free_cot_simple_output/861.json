    "problem": "3 cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that they can be arranged into a group of three consecutive cards, all of the same suit? For this problem, an Ace can either come before a 2 or after a King, but not both (so A23 and QKA both count, but KA2 doesn't).",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{52}{3} = 22,\\!100$ ways to choose 3 cards out of 52, without regard to order. For any suit, there are 12 possible triples of consecutive cards (since the three consecutive cards can start on an A, 2, 3, ..., or Q, but not on a K). Since there are 4 suits, there are $4\\cdot12=48$ valid triples. The chance that three cards chosen randomly are three consecutive cards of the same suit is therefore $\\frac{48}{22,\\!100}=\\boxed{\\frac{12}{5,\\!525}}$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, let's consider the ways to choose three consecutive cards of the same suit from a standard deck of 52 cards. We have 4 suits in total: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades.\n## Step 2: For each suit, we need to determine the number of ways to choose three consecutive cards. Since we are choosing cards that are consecutive in the order of the cards (Ace through King), we can choose any set of three consecutive cards. There are 13 possible sets of three consecutive cards in each suit (e.g., Ace through 3, 2 through 4, 3 through 5, and so on up to King through Ace). However, we also have to account for the fact that an Ace can either come before a 2 or after a King, so there are only 10 sets that are valid for our purposes (not counting KA2).\n## Step 3: Therefore, for each suit, there are 10 valid sets of three consecutive cards.\n## Step 4: Since there are four suits, we have a total of $4 \\cdot 10 = 40$ sets of three consecutive cards.\n## Step 5: Next, we need to determine the ways to choose 3 cards from the 52-card deck. The number of ways to choose 3 cards from 52 is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{r}=\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$ where $n$ is the total number of items, $r$ is the number of items chosen, and $!$ denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n## Step 6: We can use this formula to find the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from the 52-card deck: $\\binom{52}{3}=\\frac{52!}{3!(52-3)!}=\\frac{52!}{3!\\cdot49!}=22100$.\n## Step 7: Finally, we can find the probability by dividing the total number of sets of three consecutive cards by the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from the 52-card deck. So the probability is $\\frac{40}{22100}$.\n## Step 8: Therefore, the probability that the three chosen cards can be arranged in a group of three consecutive cards, all of the same suit, is $\\frac{40}{22100}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{552}}$"
