    "solution": "The Binomial Theorem says that, to find the coefficient of $x^ay^b$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^{a+b}$, we choose $a$ of the $(a+b)$ terms to contribute $x$ to the product, then the other $b$ terms contribute a $y$. Similarly, to find the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in $(x+y+z)^8$, we choose 3 of the 8 $(x+y+z)$ terms in the product $(x+y+z)^8$ to contribute an $x$ (which we can do in $\\binom{8}{3}$ ways), 3 of the remaining 5 terms to contribute a $y$ (which we can do in $\\binom{5}{3}$ ways), and the remaining 2 terms contribute $z$'s to the product. Thus, our answer is  \\[\\binom{8}{3}\\binom{5}{3}=56\\cdot 10=\\boxed{560}\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are given the expression $(x+y+z)^8$ and we need to find the coefficient of the term $x^3y^3z^2$.\n## Step 2:  To find this coefficient, we can use the Binomial Theorem, which states that for any non-negative integer $n$, the expansion of $(a+b)^n$ is given by $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k$.\n## Step 3:  Here, we have $(x+y+z)^8$, which is similar to the form $(a+b)^n$. So, we can apply the Binomial Theorem to expand it.\n## Step 4:  The Binomial Theorem tells us that in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$, each term will be of the form $\\binom{8}{k}x^{8-k}y^kz^k$ for some non-negative integer $k$.\n## Step 5:  We are specifically interested in the term $x^3y^3z^2$. To find the coefficient of this term, we need to find the term in the expansion that corresponds to $x^3y^3z^2$.\n## Step 6:  Since there are three variables $x$, $y$, and $z$, we need to consider the distribution of powers among them. The exponent of $x$ is $3$, of $y$ is $3$, and of $z$ is $2$.\n## Step 7:  Using the Binomial Theorem, the term corresponding to $x^3y^3z^2$ is $\\binom{8}{3}x^3y^3z^2$, but since there are three variables, the term must be $\\binom{8}{1,3,4}x^3y^3z^2$.\n## Step 8:  The coefficient of this term is given by $\\binom{8}{1,3,4}=\\binom{8}{4}=\\frac{8!}{4!(8-4)!}$.\n## Step 9:  We need to evaluate this expression to find the coefficient of the term $x^3y^3z^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$.\n## Step 10:  Calculating the value of $\\binom{8}{4}$ gives us $\\frac{8!}{4!4!}=\\frac{8\\cdot7\\cdot6\\cdot5}{4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot1}=70$.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$ is $70$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{70}$"
