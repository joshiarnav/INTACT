    "problem": "Seven cards each containing one of the following letters C, B, T, A, E, M and H are placed in a hat. Each letter is used only once. Stu will pull four cards out at random and without replacement. What is the probability that Stu pulls out M, A, T, H in this order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that Stu pulls the M out first is 1/7. The probability that he then pulls the A out next is 1/6, since there are now 6 letter remaining.  Continuing in this way, the probability that he pulls out T next is 1/5 and the probability that H then follows is 1/4.  Therefore, the probability that he pulls out M, A, T, H in this order is $1/7 \\times 1/6 \\times 1/5 \\times 1/4 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{840}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to select 4 cards out of 7\nTo find the total number of ways to select 4 cards out of 7, we can use the combination formula. The number of ways to choose 4 cards out of 7 without regard to order is given by \\(C(7, 4)\\), which is calculated as \\(\\frac{7!}{4!(7-4)!} = \\frac{7!}{4!3!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\\).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing M first\nThe probability of drawing M first is the number of times M can appear first divided by the total number of ways to draw the first card, which is 7. This is \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of drawing A second\nAfter M is drawn, there are 6 cards left, and A must be among them. The probability of drawing A second is the number of times A can appear second divided by the remaining number of cards, which is 6. This is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of drawing T third\nAfter M and A are drawn, there are 5 cards left, and T must be among them. The probability of drawing T third is the number of times T can appear third divided by the remaining number of cards, which is 5. This is \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of drawing H fourth\nAfter M, A, and T are drawn, there are 4 cards left, and H must be among them. The probability of drawing H fourth is the number of times H can appear fourth divided by the remaining number of cards, which is 4. This is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the overall probability of drawing M, A, T, H in this order\nTo find the overall probability of drawing M, A, T, H in this order, we multiply the probabilities calculated in steps 2 through 5: \\(\\frac{1}{7} \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4} = \\frac{1}{840}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{840}}$"
