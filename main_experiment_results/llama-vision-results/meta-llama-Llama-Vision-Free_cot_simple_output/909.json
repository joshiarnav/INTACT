    "problem": "There are 190 people on the beach.  110 are wearing sunglasses, 70 are wearing bathing suits, and 95 are wearing a hat.  Everyone is wearing at least one of these items. 30 are wearing both bathing suits and sunglasses. 25 are wearing both bathing suits and a hat. 40 are wearing both sunglasses and a hat.  How many people are wearing all three items?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be number of people wearing all three items.  Since 30 people are wearing bathing suits and sunglasses, we know that $30 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and sunglasses.  Similarly, $25 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and hats, while $40 - x$ are wearing just sunglasses and a hat.\n\nTo find the number of people wearing just sunglasses, we subtract the people who are wearing sunglasses with other items from the total number of people wearing sunglasses, which is $110 - (30 - x) - (40 - x) - x = 40 + x$.  Similarly, the number of people wearing just hats is $30 + x$, while the number of people wearing just bathing suits is $15 + x$.\n\nSince the total number of people on the beach is 190, and everyone is wearing one of the items, we have: \\begin{align*}\n190 &= (15 + x) + (40 + x) + (30 + x) \\\\\n&\\qquad+ (25 - x ) + (30 - x) + (40 - x) + x\\\\\n&= 180 + x.\n\\end{align*} We can then solve for $x$, so the number of people on the beach wearing all three items is $x = \\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break this down step by step.\n\nLet's start with the total number of people wearing each item:\n\n* Sunglasses: 110\n* Bathing suits: 70\n* Hats: 95\n\nWe also know that 30 are wearing both bathing suits and sunglasses, 25 are wearing both bathing suits and a hat, and 40 are wearing both sunglasses and a hat.\n\nLet's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of people wearing all three items. This principle states that the total number of people wearing at least one item is equal to the sum of the number of people wearing each item, minus the sum of the number of people wearing each pair of items, plus the number of people wearing all three items.\n\nWe can set up an equation based on this principle:\n\nTotal = S + B + H - (SB + BH + SH) + A\n\nwhere:\n* Total is the total number of people on the beach (190)\n* S is the number of people wearing sunglasses (110)\n* B is the number of people wearing bathing suits (70)\n* H is the number of people wearing hats (95)\n* SB is the number of people wearing sunglasses and bathing suits (30)\n* BH is the number of people wearing bathing suits and hats (25)\n* SH is the number of people wearing sunglasses and hats (40)\n* A is the number of people wearing all three items (which we want to find)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n190 = 110 + 70 + 95 - (30 + 25 + 40) + A\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n190 = 275 - 95 + A\n190 = 180 + A\n\nSubtracting 180 from both sides, we get:\n\n10 = A\n\nTherefore, 10 people are wearing all three items: sunglasses, bathing suits, and hats."
