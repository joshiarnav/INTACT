    "problem": "A nursery employee wishes to plant 2 identical Golden Delicious apple trees and 5 identical Bartlett pear trees in one row. How many distinct arrangements are possible?",
    "solution": "We have 7 places to plant trees in our row.  We can choose two of these to be Golden Delicious in $\\binom{7}{2}= \\boxed{21}$ ways.  For each of these choices, we plant the Bartlett pears in the remaining 5 places.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the number of distinct arrangements possible for planting 2 identical Golden Delicious apple trees and 5 identical Bartlett pear trees in one row.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the problem\nSince the trees are identical within their respective types, we only need to consider the arrangement of the two types of trees.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of trees\nThere are 2 Golden Delicious apple trees and 5 Bartlett pear trees, making a total of 7 trees.\n\n## Step 4: Use the formula for combinations of identical items\nThe formula for combinations of identical items is n! / (k1! * k2! * ...), where n is the total number of items, and k1, k2, etc., are the counts of identical items.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the formula\nWe have 7 trees in total (n=7), 2 Golden Delicious apple trees (k1=2), and 5 Bartlett pear trees (k2=5). Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is 7! / (2! * 5!).\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the factorial values\n7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040, 2! = 2 * 1 = 2, and 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of distinct arrangements\nNow we can calculate the number of distinct arrangements using the formula: 5040 / (2 * 120) = 5040 / 240 = 21.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$"
