    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern in Pascal's triangle for even and odd entries.\n## Step 2:  We are asked to find how many of the first 100 rows contain at least one even entry and no odd entries other than 1.\n## Step 3:  Let's analyze the given information: the first row of Pascal's triangle is the row with a single 1. The second row contains one odd entry and one even entry. The third row contains two odd entries and two even entries.\n## Step 4:  We can generalize that every row in the triangle is either all odd, or it starts and ends with 1, and all other entries are even.\n## Step 5:  If a row in Pascal's triangle has $n$ as its row number, then the parity of its entries follows the $n$th row of the following matrix, where each entry is 0 if it is even and 1 if it is odd.\n## Step 6:  First, let's establish that the parity of entries in a row of Pascal's triangle follows a pattern in relation to the row number $n$. If $n$ is a power of 2, then all the entries in the row will be even.\n## Step 7:  On the other hand, if $n$ is not a power of 2, then all the entries other than the first and last will be even, and the first and last entries will be 1.\n## Step 8:  Now, let's find how many rows of the first 100 rows of Pascal's triangle will contain at least one even entry and no odd entries other than 1.\n## Step 9:  To do this, we need to find the number of rows for which $n$ is a power of 2, and then the number of rows for which $n$ is not a power of 2.\n## Step 10:  The powers of 2 less than 100 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. Therefore, there are 7 rows where all entries are even.\n## Step 11:  Similarly, there are 96 rows for which $n$ is not a power of 2.\n## Step 12:  So, out of the 100 rows, 96 rows have at least one even entry and no odd entries other than 1.\n## Step 13:  Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{96}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{96}$"
