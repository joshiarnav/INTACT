    "problem": "What is the probability that flipping a fair coin three times produces fewer than two heads? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "This is the probability of flipping no heads (three tails) or one head (two tails). This is the same as the probability of flipping two heads (one tail) or three heads (no tails), since we can just interchange heads and tails. Since all outcomes are covered, both probabilities add up to 1, so the desired probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of outcomes when flipping a fair coin three times and then calculate the number of outcomes that result in fewer than two heads.\n## Step 2:  First, let's consider the total number of outcomes when flipping a coin three times. Since each flip has two possibilities (heads or tails), the total number of outcomes is $2^3 = 8$.\n## Step 3:  Now, we need to calculate the number of outcomes that result in fewer than two heads. This means we're looking for the number of outcomes with 0 heads or 1 head.\n## Step 4:  To get 0 heads, we need all three flips to result in tails, which can happen in only 1 way.\n## Step 5:  To get 1 head, there are three possible positions it can occur in - first, second, or third flip. So, there are 3 ways to get 1 head.\n## Step 6:  The total number of outcomes with fewer than two heads is $1+3=4$.\n## Step 7:  Now, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (fewer than two heads) by the total number of outcomes.\n## Step 8:  So, the probability of getting fewer than two heads is $\\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$"
