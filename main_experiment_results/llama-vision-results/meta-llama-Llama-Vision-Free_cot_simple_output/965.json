    "problem": "A Senate committee consists of 5 Republicans, 6 Democrats, and 2 Independents.  A subcommittee of 3 members is randomly chosen.  What is the probability that the subcommittee consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent?",
    "solution": "There are 5 ways to choose a Republican, 6 ways to choose a Democrat, and 2 ways to choose an Independent for a total of $5 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 60$ different subcommittees of a Republican, Democrat, and Independent.   There are $\\binom{13}{3} = \\dfrac{13\\cdot12\\cdot 11}{3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1} = 286$ ways to choose 3 people from 13 to form a committee, so there are 286 possible committees. Therefore, the probability that the subcommittee is made up of a Republican, Democrat, and Independent is $\\dfrac{60}{286} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{30}{143}}$ .",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are asked to find the probability of forming a subcommittee of 3 members with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent from a Senate committee consisting of 5 Republicans, 6 Democrats, and 2 Independents.\n## Step 2:  To solve this problem, we can start by calculating the total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members from the entire committee. This can be calculated using the combination formula $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of members and $r$ is the number of members to be chosen.\n## Step 3:  In this case, we have $n=13$ members (5 Republicans, 6 Democrats, and 2 Independents) and we want to choose $r=3$ members for the subcommittee. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members from the entire committee is $\\binom{13}{3} = \\frac{13!}{3!(13-3)!} = 286$.\n## Step 4:  Next, we need to find the number of ways to choose 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent for the subcommittee. We can calculate these combinations separately and then multiply them to find the total number of favorable outcomes.\n## Step 5:  There are $\\binom{5}{1} = 5$ ways to choose 1 Republican, $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to choose 1 Democrat, and $\\binom{2}{1} = 2$ ways to choose 1 Independent.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is $5 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 60$.\n## Step 7:  Now, we can calculate the probability of forming a subcommittee with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n## Step 8:  This gives us $\\frac{60}{286}$, which can be simplified to $\\frac{30}{143}$.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the probability of forming a subcommittee with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent is $\\frac{30}{143}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{30}{143}}$"
