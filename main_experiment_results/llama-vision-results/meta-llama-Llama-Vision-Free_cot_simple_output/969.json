    "problem": "Two real numbers are chosen at random between $0$ and $2.$ What is the probability that the sum of their squares is no more than $4?$ Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "We let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$.  The set of all possible pairs $(x,y)$ satisfy the inequalities $0<x<2$ and $0<y<2$; we can graph these points as a square on the $x-y$ plane with vertices $(0,0),(2,0),(2,2)$ and $(0,2)$.

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are tasked with finding the probability that the sum of the squares of two real numbers chosen at random between $0$ and $2$ is no more than $4$.\n## Step 2:  To begin, let's consider the sample space, which consists of all possible pairs of real numbers $(x, y)$ chosen at random between $0$ and $2.$\n## Step 3:  Our condition is that the sum of their squares, $x^2 + y^2$, should be no more than $4$. This gives us a region in the square $0 \\le x \\le 2, 0 \\le y \\le 2$ with $x^2 + y^2 \\le 4$, which forms a circle centered at the origin with radius $2$.\n## Step 4:  To find the area of this region, we note that it's a quarter of a circle with radius $2$, so the area is $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi \\cdot 2^2 = \\pi.$\n## Step 5:  Next, we need to determine the total area of the sample space, which is the area of the square with side length $2$, that is, $2^2 = 4.$\n## Step 6:  Now, we can calculate the probability by taking the ratio of the area of the region that satisfies our condition to the total area of the sample space.\n## Step 7:  The probability is given by the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square, which is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}.$\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the probability that the sum of the squares of the two real numbers chosen at random between $0$ and $2$ is no more than $4$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$"
