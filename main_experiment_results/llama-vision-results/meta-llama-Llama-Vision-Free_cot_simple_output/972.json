    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Identify the total number of letters in the word CIRCLE\nThe word CIRCLE has 7 letters.\n\n## Step 2:  Determine the number of repetitions for each letter\nIn the word CIRCLE, there are 2 C's, 1 I, 1 R, 1 L, and 1 E.\n\n## Step 3:  Apply the formula for permutations with repeated elements\nThe formula for permutations of n objects where there are n1, n2, etc. repeated elements is n! / (n1! * n2! * ...). In this case, n is 7, n1 is 2 (for C), and the rest of the letters appear once.\n\n## Step 4:  Calculate the factorial of the total number of letters\n7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040.\n\n## Step 5:  Calculate the factorial of the repeated letter \"C\"\n2! = 2 * 1 = 2.\n\n## Step 6:  Apply the formula with the calculated factorials\nThe number of arrangements is 7! / 2! = 5040 / 2.\n\n## Step 7:  Perform the division\n5040 / 2 = 2520.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2520}$"
