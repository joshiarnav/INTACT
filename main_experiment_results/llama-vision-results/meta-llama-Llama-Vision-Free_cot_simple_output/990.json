    "problem": "On the $xy$-plane, the origin is labeled with an $M$. The points $(1,0)$, $(-1,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(0,-1)$ are labeled with $A$'s. The points $(2,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(0,2)$, $(-1, 1)$, $(-2, 0)$, $(-1, -1)$, $(0, -2)$, and $(1, -1)$ are labeled with $T$'s. The points $(3,0)$, $(2,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(0, 3)$, $(-1, 2)$, $(-2, 1)$, $(-3, 0)$, $(-2,-1)$, $(-1,-2)$, $(0, -3)$, $(1, -2)$, and $(2, -1)$ are labeled with $H$'s. If you are only allowed to move up, down, left, and right, starting from the origin, how many distinct paths can be followed to spell the word MATH?",
    "solution": "From the M, we can proceed to four different As. Note that the letters are all symmetric, so we can simply count one case (say, that of moving from M to the bottom A) and then multiply by four.\n\nFrom the bottom A, we can proceed to any one of three Ts. From the two Ts to the sides of the A, we can proceed to one of two Hs. From the T that is below the A, we can proceed to one of three Hs. Thus, this case yields $2 \\cdot 2 + 3 = 7$ paths.\n\nThus, there are $4 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{28}$ distinct paths.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, let's understand the problem.\nWe are given a grid on the xy-plane labeled with M, A's, T's, and H's. The goal is to determine the number of distinct paths that can be followed, starting from the origin, and spelling the word MATH.\n\n## Step 2: Let's analyze the grid.\nThe points are labeled with M, A's, T's, and H's as follows:\n- The origin is labeled with an M.\n- The points (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), and (0,-1) are labeled with A's.\n- The points (2,0), (1,1), (0,2), (-1, 1), (-2, 0), (-1, -1), (0, -2), and (1, -1) are labeled with T's.\n- The points (3,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0, 3), (-1, 2), (-2, 1), (-3, 0), (-2,-1), (-1,-2), (0, -3), (1, -2), and (2, -1) are labeled with H's.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the order of M, A, T, and H on the grid.\nWe need to find paths that spell MATH.\n\n## Step 4: Find the number of ways to spell M.\nThere is only one way to spell M, which is starting at the origin.\n\n## Step 5: Find the number of ways to spell A.\nTo spell A, we need to move to one of the four points labeled with A's, which are (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), and (0,-1). There are 4 ways to do this.\n\n## Step 6: Find the number of ways to spell T.\nTo spell T, we need to move to one of the 8 points labeled with T's, which are (2,0), (1,1), (0,2), (-1, 1), (-2, 0), (-1, -1), (0, -2), and (1, -1). There are 8 ways to do this.\n\n## Step 7: Find the number of ways to spell H.\nTo spell H, we need to move to one of the 12 points labeled with H's, which are (3,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0, 3), (-1, 2), (-2, 1), (-3, 0), (-2,-1), (-1,-2), (0, -3), (1, -2), and (2, -1). There are 12 ways to do this.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total number of distinct paths to spell MATH.\nWe multiply the number of ways to spell each letter together: 1 * 4 * 8 * 12 = 384.\n\n## Step 9: Account for the possibility of skipping some letters.\nHowever, we also need to consider the possibility of skipping some letters. Let's start with M.\n\n## Step 10: If we do not start with M, the total number of distinct paths becomes 0.\n\n## Step 11: Now we calculate the number of ways to skip M.\nThere is only one way to skip M, which is to start with A.\n\n## Step 12: Now we calculate the number of ways to skip A.\nTo skip A, we need to move past the four points labeled with A's without visiting any of them.\n\n## Step 13: We will assume that M is in the path.\nWe will calculate the number of ways to skip A assuming M is in the path.\n\n## Step 14: We will calculate the number of ways to spell A with M in the path.\nIf M is in the path, we have four options for A (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), and (0,-1), and there are 8 ways to spell T and 12 ways to spell H.\n\n## Step 15: Calculate the number of ways to spell A with M in the path.\nThere are 4 * 8 * 12 = 384 ways to spell A with M in the path.\n\n## Step 16: Now we calculate the number of ways to skip A.\nIf we skip A, we have 8 ways to spell T and 12 ways to spell H.\n\n## Step 17: Calculate the number of ways to skip A.\nThere are 8 * 12 = 96 ways to skip A.\n\n## Step 18: Now we calculate the number of ways to spell MATH.\nTo spell MATH, we either spell A and M or skip A and spell M.\n\n## Step 19: Now we calculate the total number of distinct paths to spell MATH.\nWe add the number of ways to spell A and M (384) and the number of ways to skip A and spell M (96).\n\n## Step 20: Calculate the total number of distinct paths to spell MATH.\n384 + 96 = 480.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{480}$"
