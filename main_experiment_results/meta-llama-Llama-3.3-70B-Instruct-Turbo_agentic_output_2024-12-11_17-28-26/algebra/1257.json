    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We are looking at the range of $f(x)$ when $x$ is in the interval $[1,\\infty)$. Because $k < 0$, $f(x)$ is decreasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. We see that $f(1) = 1^k = 1$, and as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ approaches 0, but never reaches it.  Hence, on the interval $[1,\\infty)$, $f(x)$ takes on all values between 0 (exclusive) and 1 inclusive, which means the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{(0,1]}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$, we first need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = x^k$ where $k < 0$. Since $k < 0$, $f(x)$ represents a decreasing function as $x$ increases because when $k$ is negative, as $x$ gets larger, $x^k$ gets smaller. \n\nThis is the first step in analyzing the function's behavior on the given interval. Next, we would evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval and determine its behavior as $x$ approaches infinity.\nTo continue with the analysis, let's evaluate the function $f(x) = x^k$ at the endpoints of the interval $[1, \\infty)$.\n\nAt $x = 1$, $f(1) = 1^k = 1$ because any number raised to the power of anything will be 1 if the base is 1 (except for $0^0$, which is undefined).\n\nAs $x$ approaches infinity, since $k < 0$, $f(x) = x^k$ approaches 0. This is because a negative exponent causes the function value to decrease as $x$ increases, and as $x$ gets infinitely large, $x^k$ gets infinitely close to 0.\n\nGiven that $f(x)$ is a decreasing function on the interval $[1, \\infty)$, and considering the values at the endpoints, the range of $f(x)$ on this interval starts from the value at $x = 1$, which is 1, and decreases towards 0 as $x$ approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ is $(0, 1]$.\n\n$\\\nSince we have already determined that the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ starts from the value at $x = 1$, which is 1, and decreases towards 0 as $x$ approaches infinity, and given that $f(x)$ is a decreasing function on this interval, the range of $f(x)$ is indeed all the values between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{(0, 1]}$",
