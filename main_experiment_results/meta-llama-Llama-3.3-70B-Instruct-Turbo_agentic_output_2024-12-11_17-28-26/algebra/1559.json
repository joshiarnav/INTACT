    "problem": "If $27^8=9^q$, what is $q$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We begin by expressing both sides of the equation in terms of the base 2: $(3^3)^8=(3^2)^q$, which simplifies to $3^{24}=3^{2q}$. Setting the exponents equal to each other, $24=2q$, or $q=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To solve the equation \\(27^8 = 9^q\\), let's first express both sides of the equation in terms of the same base. Since \\(27 = 3^3\\) and \\(9 = 3^2\\), we can rewrite the equation as \\((3^3)^8 = (3^2)^q\\). This simplifies to \\(3^{24} = 3^{2q}\\).\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents, which gives us \\(24 = 2q\\). To solve for \\(q\\), we divide both sides of the equation by 2.\n\n\\(q = \\frac{24}{2}\\)\n\n\\(q = 12\\)\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is $\\boxed{12}$.",
