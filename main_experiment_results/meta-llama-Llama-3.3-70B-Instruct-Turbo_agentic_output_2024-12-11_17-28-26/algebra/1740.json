    "problem": "A box with a volume of 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold 50 paperclips. How many paperclips could a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ hold?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of paperclips that a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ could hold. Setting up the ratio $\\frac{50}{16}=\\frac{x}{48}$ and solving for $x$ gives $x=150$.  Hence, a 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ box could hold $\\boxed{150}$ paperclips.  We also could have noted that tripling the size of the box triples the number of paperclips we can hold, so the new box can hold $50\\cdot 3 = 150$ paperclips.",

    "model_solution": "To find out how many paperclips a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold, we first need to determine the ratio of the volume of the larger box to the smaller box. \n\nThe ratio of the volumes is calculated as: \nVolume of larger box / Volume of smaller box = 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ / 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ = 3.\nTo find out how many paperclips a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold, we use the ratio of the volumes to scale up the number of paperclips the smaller box can hold. Since the volume ratio is 3, the larger box can hold 3 times as many paperclips as the smaller box.\n\nNumber of paperclips in larger box = 3 * Number of paperclips in smaller box\n= 3 * 50\n= 150\n\nTherefore, a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold $\\boxed{150}$ paperclips.",
