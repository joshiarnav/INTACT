    "solution": "If the line $x+y=b$ intersects the midpoint, which is: $$\\left(\\frac{2+4}{2},\\frac{5+9}{2}\\right)=(3,7)$$This point lies on the line $x+y=b$, so we must have $3+7=b$. Thus, $b=\\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $b$, we first need to determine the midpoint of the line segment from $(2,5)$ to $(4,9)$. The midpoint formula is given by $\\left( \\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2} \\right)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the endpoints. \n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the midpoint as $\\left( \\frac{2+4}{2}, \\frac{5+9}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{6}{2}, \\frac{14}{2} \\right) = \\left( 3, 7 \\right)$.\nNow that we have found the midpoint of the line segment to be $(3, 7)$, we can use the fact that this point lies on the line $x+y=b$. Substituting the coordinates of the midpoint into the equation of the line, we get:\n\n$3 + 7 = b$\n\nCombining the constants on the left-hand side, we have:\n\n$10 = b$\n\nTherefore, the value of $b$ is $\\boxed{10}$.",
