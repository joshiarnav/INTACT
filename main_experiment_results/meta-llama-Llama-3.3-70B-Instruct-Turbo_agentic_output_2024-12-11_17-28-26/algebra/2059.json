    "solution": "We can have $\\log_{10}10=1$ and $\\log_{10}100=2$.  Since $\\log_{10}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\\log_{10}10<\\log_{10}17<\\log_{10}100$, meaning $1<\\log_{10}17<2$.  Thus, the desired sum is $1+2=\\boxed{3}$.",

Since $10^1 = 10$ and $10^2 = 100$, and 17 is greater than 10 but less than 100, $\\log_{10}{17}$ must be between 1 and 2. \n\nThus, $a = 1$ and $b = 2$. \n\nNext step will calculate $a + b$.\nTo find the value of $a + b$, we simply add the two consecutive integers $a$ and $b$ together. \n\n$a + b = 1 + 2 = 3$\n\nTherefore, the sum of $a$ and $b$ is $3$. \n\n$\\boxed{3}$",
