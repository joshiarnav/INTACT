    "solution": "We factor the denominator in the left-hand side to get \\[\\frac{5x+2}{(x-10)(x+3)}= \\frac{A}{x - 10} + \\frac{B}{x + 3}.\\]We then multiply both sides by $(x - 10)(x + 3)$, to get \\[5x + 2 = A(x + 3) + B(x - 10).\\]We can solve for $A$ and $B$ by substituting suitable values of $x$.  For example, setting $x = 10$, the equation becomes $52 = 13A$, so $A = 4$.  Setting $x = -3$, the equation becomes $-13 = -13B$, so $B = 1$.  Therefore, $(A,B) = \\boxed{(4,1)}$.",
