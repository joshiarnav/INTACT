    "solution": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the solutions the the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$. We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively, so $p+q = m/10$ and $pq = 420/10 = 42$. Since $m = 10(p+q)$, we minimize $m$ by minimizing the sum $p+q$. Since $p$ and $q$ are integers and multiply to 42, the possible values of $(p,q)$ are $(1,42),(2,21),(3,14),(6,7),(7,6),(14,3),(21,2),(42,1)$. (Note that if $p$ and $q$ are both negative, then $p+q$ is negative, so $m$ would be negative, which is excluded by the problem.) The sum $p+q$ is minimized when $(p,q) = (6,7)$ or $(7,6)$. In either case, $m = 10(p+q) = 10(6+7) = \\boxed{130}.$",

A quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ has integral solutions if and only if the discriminant, $b^2 - 4ac$, is a perfect square.\n\nFor the given equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$, we have $a = 10$, $b = -m$, and $c = 420$. The discriminant is $(-m)^2 - 4 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 420 = m^2 - 16800$. \n\nWe need $m^2 - 16800$ to be a perfect square for the equation to have integral solutions. Let's express this as $m^2 - 16800 = k^2$, where $k$ is an integer. Rearranging, we get $m^2 - k^2 = 16800$. \n\nThis is the first step in solving for $m$. We will factor $16800$ and use the difference of squares identity\nThe difference of squares identity states that $m^2 - k^2 = (m + k)(m - k)$. Applying this identity to our equation, we have $(m + k)(m - k) = 16800$. To find the smallest positive value of $m$, we need to factor $16800$ into two factors that are as close as possible in value, because $m$ will be the average of these two factors.\n\nThe prime factorization of $16800$ is $2^5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$. We can factor $16800$ as $120 \\cdot 140$, which gives us $(m + k) = 140$ and $(m - k) = 120$. \n\nSolving these two equations simultaneously, we add them to get $2m = 260$, so $m = 130$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive value of $m$ so that the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ has integral solutions is $\\boxed{130}$.",
