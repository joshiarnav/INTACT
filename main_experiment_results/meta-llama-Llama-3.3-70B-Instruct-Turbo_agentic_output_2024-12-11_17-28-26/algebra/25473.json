    "problem": "Joann rode her bike at an average speed of 12 miles per hour for three and a half hours. If her friend, Fran, rides for 3 hours, at what average speed, in miles per hour, would she have to ride her bike to travel the same distance that Joann traveled?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "In $3\\frac{1}{2}$ hours, Joann covers $\\left(3\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ hours}\\right)(12\\text{ mph})=42$ miles.  If Fran's average speed in miles per hour is $s$, then Fran covers $3s$ miles in $3$ hours.  Solving $3s=42$ we find $s=\\boxed{14}$ miles per hour.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, the first step is to calculate the distance that Joann traveled. We can do this by multiplying her average speed (12 miles per hour) by the time she rode her bike (3.5 hours). \n\nDistance = Speed * Time \nDistance = 12 * 3.5 \nDistance = 42 miles\n\nSo, Joann traveled a total distance of 42 miles.\nNow that we know Joann traveled a total distance of 42 miles, the next step is to find the average speed at which Fran needs to ride her bike to cover the same distance in 3 hours.\n\nWe can use the same formula: Distance = Speed * Time. Since we want to find the speed, we can rearrange the formula to solve for Speed: Speed = Distance / Time.\n\nFor Fran, the distance is 42 miles (the same distance Joann traveled), and the time is 3 hours. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nSpeed = 42 miles / 3 hours\nSpeed = 14 miles per hour\n\nTherefore, Fran needs to ride her bike at an average speed of 14 miles per hour to travel the same distance that Joann traveled.\n\n$\\boxed{14}$",
