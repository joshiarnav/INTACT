    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First we try factoring the left side to simplify it: $$\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15}=\\frac{4(x-3)}{(x-3)(x+5)}=\\frac{4}{x+5}.$$Now we can multiply both sides by $(x+5)$ and solve for $x$: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{4}{x+5}&=x+2\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n4&=(x+5)(x+2)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=x^2+7x+10\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=x^2+7x+6\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=(x+6)(x+1).\n\\end{align*}So $p=-1$ and $q=-6$, making $p-q=\\boxed{5}$.",
