    "solution": "Since $E$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$, it has coordinates $(\\frac{1}{2}(8+0),\\frac{1}{2}(0+0))=(4,0)$.\nThe line passing through the points $A$ and $E$ has slope $\\frac{6-0}{0-4}=-\\frac{3}{2}$; the $y$-intercept of this line is the $y$-coordinate of point $A$, or 6.\nTherefore, the equation of the line passing through points $A$ and $E$ is $y=-\\frac{3}{2}x+6$.\nPoint $F$ is the intersection point of the lines with equation $y=-\\frac{3}{8}x+3$ and $y=-\\frac{3}{2}x+6$.\nTo find the coordinates of point $F$ we solve the system of equations by equating $y$:\n\\begin{align*}\n-\\tfrac{3}{8}x+3&=-\\tfrac{3}{2}x+6\\\\\n8(-\\tfrac{3}{8}x+3)&=8(-\\tfrac{3}{2}x+6)\\\\\n-3x+24&=-12x+48\\\\\n9x&=24\n\\end{align*}Thus the $x$-coordinate of point $F$ is $x=\\frac{8}{3}$; it follows that $y=-\\frac{3}{2}\\times \\frac{8}{3}+6=2$.  Hence $F=(\\frac{8}{3},2)$ and sum of its coordinates are $\\frac{8}{3} + 2 = \\frac{8}{3}+\\frac{6}{3}=\\boxed{\\frac{14}{3}}$.",
