    "problem": "Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles. If it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles, using the same rates, how many minutes would it take Jordan to run 5 miles?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since Steve's 3-mile time is 24 minutes, Jordan ran 2 miles in $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot24=12$ minutes.  Therefore, each mile takes Jordan 6 minutes to run, so he would take $6\\cdot5=\\boxed{30}$ minutes to run five miles.",

Since Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles, and it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles, we can find the time it took Jordan to run 2 miles.\n\nTime taken by Jordan to run 2 miles = (1/2) * Time taken by Steve to run 3 miles\n= (1/2) * 24 minutes\n= 12 minutes\n\nSo, Jordan ran 2 miles in 12 minutes.\nNow that we know Jordan ran 2 miles in 12 minutes, we can find Jordan's rate of running in miles per minute.\n\nRate = Distance / Time\n= 2 miles / 12 minutes\n= 1/6 miles per minute\n\nUsing this rate, we can find the time it would take Jordan to run 5 miles.\n\nTime = Distance / Rate\n= 5 miles / (1/6 miles per minute)\n= 5 * 6 minutes\n= 30 minutes\n\nTherefore, it would take Jordan 30 minutes to run 5 miles.\n\n$\\boxed{30}$",
