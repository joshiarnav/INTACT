    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Note that $f(x)$ is defined if and only if $x\\ge 3$.\n\nThus $f(f(x)) = f(\\sqrt{x-3})$ is defined if and only if $$\\sqrt{x-3}\\ge 3.$$ This is true if and only if $$x-3\\ge 3^2,$$ or equivalently, if $x\\ge 12$. So the smallest real number for which $f(f(x))$ is defined is $\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest real number $x$ in the domain of $f(f(x))$, we first need to determine the expression for $f(f(x))$. \n\nGiven $f(x) = \\sqrt{x-3}$, we substitute $f(x)$ into $f(f(x))$:\n$f(f(x)) = f(\\sqrt{x-3}) = \\sqrt{\\sqrt{x-3} - 3}$.\n\nNow we have the expression for $f(f(x))$. Next, we will determine the conditions for the domain of $f(f(x))$.\nTo find the domain of $f(f(x))$, we need to ensure that the expression under the square root is non-negative. \n\nGiven $f(f(x)) = \\sqrt{\\sqrt{x-3} - 3}$, we have two conditions to consider:\n\n1. The expression under the inner square root must be non-negative: $x - 3 \\geq 0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x \\geq 3$.\n2. The expression under the outer square root must be non-negative: $\\sqrt{x-3} - 3 \\geq 0$. Solving for $x$, we get $\\sqrt{x-3} \\geq 3$. Squaring both sides, we get $x - 3 \\geq 9$, which simplifies to $x \\geq 12$.\n\nSince both conditions must be satisfied, the smallest real number $x$ in the domain of $f(f(x))$ is the larger of the two values, which is $x \\geq 12$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest real number $x$ in the domain of $f(f(x))$ is $\\boxed{12}$.",
