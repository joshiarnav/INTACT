    "solution": "The number of squares in the rectangles is an arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference 1. Thus, at Stage 6, there will be 6 squares. Since each square has an area of $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ square inches, the total area of the rectangle at Stage 6 is $6 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{54}$ square inches.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the pattern of adding squares\nAt each stage, a 3'' by 3'' square is added to the existing rectangle. This means that the length of the rectangle increases by 3 inches at each stage, while the width remains the same at 3 inches.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of squares at Stage 6\nSince one square is added at each successive stage, at Stage 6, there will be 6 squares in total.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total area of the rectangle at Stage 6\nThe area of each square is 3 * 3 = 9 square inches. Since there are 6 squares at Stage 6, the total area of the rectangle will be 6 * 9 = 54 square inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{54}$",
