    "problem": "The graph of a certain quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertex $(-4,0)$ which passes through the point $(1,-75)$.  What is the value of $a$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic must be of the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$.  The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, which gives us the equation $-75 = 25a$.  Hence, $a = -75/25 = \\boxed{-3}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To find the value of $a$, we should start by using the given vertex $(-4,0)$ to express the quadratic equation in vertex form, which is $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the parabola. \n\nGiven the vertex $(-4,0)$, we can express the equation as $y = a(x-(-4))^2 + 0$, which simplifies to $y = a(x+4)^2$. \n\nThis equation represents the parabola with the given vertex. Next, we can use the point $(1,-75)$ to solve for $a$.\nTo solve for $a$, we substitute the point $(1,-75)$ into the equation $y = a(x+4)^2$. This gives us $-75 = a(1+4)^2$. \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get $-75 = a(5)^2$, which further simplifies to $-75 = 25a$. \n\nNow, we solve for $a$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $25$, giving us $a = -75/25$. \n\nSimplifying the fraction, we find $a = -3$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{-3}$.",
