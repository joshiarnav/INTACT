    "solution": "The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$. This must equal $s$. Setting the two equal and solving, we get \\begin{align*}\ns&=\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\\\\n4s&=s^2\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4 &= s\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4\\sqrt{3}&= 3s \\\\\n\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} &=s\n\\end{align*} Thus, the perimeter of the triangle is $3s=\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}} \\text{units}$.",
