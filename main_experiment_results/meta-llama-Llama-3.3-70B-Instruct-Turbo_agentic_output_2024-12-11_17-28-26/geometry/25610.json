    "solution": "Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the dimensions of the box. It is given that \\[140=4a+4b+4c{\\qquad \\rm and\n\\qquad}21=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}\\] hence \\[35=a+b+c{\\qquad (1)\\qquad\n\\rm and\\qquad}441=a^2+b^2+c^2{\\qquad (2)}.\\]\n\nSquare both sides of $(1)$ and combine with $(2)$ to obtain \\begin{align*}\n1225 & = (a+b+c)^2 \\\\\n&= a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2bc+2ca \\\\\n&= 441+2ab+2bc+2ca.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus the surface area of the box is \\[ 2ab+2bc+2ca=1225-441=\\boxed{784}.\\]",

We're given two pieces of information: the sum of the lengths of the twelve edges of the box is $140$, and the distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner is $21$. \n\nFrom the first piece of information, we know that there are $4$ edges of length $a$, $4$ edges of length $b$, and $4$ edges of length $c$. So, the sum of all the edge lengths is $4a + 4b + 4c = 140$. Simplifying this gives us $a + b + c = 35$.\n\nFrom the second piece of information, we can use the distance formula in three dimensions to find the relationship between $a$, $b$, and $c$. The distance $d$ between two points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ in 3D space is given by $d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_\n## Step 1: Understand the given problem and the previous steps\nWe have a rectangular box with length, width, and height denoted as $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively.
