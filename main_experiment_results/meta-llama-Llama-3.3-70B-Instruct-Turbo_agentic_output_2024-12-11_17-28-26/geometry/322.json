    "problem": "The radius of a cylinder is doubled and its height is tripled. If its original volume was 10 cubic feet, what is its volume now, in cubic feet?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively.  The new cylinder has volume \\[\n\\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\\pi r^2 h,\n\\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume.  Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's start by recalling the formula for the volume of a cylinder: \n\nV = \u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height. \n\nGiven that the original volume is 10 cubic feet, we can write the equation as:\n\n10 = \u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nNow, we are told that the radius is doubled (new radius = 2r) and the height is tripled (new height = 3h). We will use this information in the next step to find the new volume.\nTo find the new volume, we can plug the new values of the radius (2r) and the height (3h) into the volume formula:\n\nV = \u03c0(2r)\u00b2(3h)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nV = \u03c0(4r\u00b2)(3h)\nV = 12\u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nNow, recalling that the original volume (\u03c0r\u00b2h) was 10 cubic feet, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\nV = 12 * 10\nV = 120\n\nTherefore, the new volume of the cylinder is 120 cubic feet.\n\n$\\boxed{180}$",
