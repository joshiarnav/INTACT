From $\\triangle AEC$ we have $\\angle ACE = 180^\\circ-60^\\circ-90^\\circ= 30^\\circ$.\n\nNow let $EC$ and $BD$ intersect at $F$. $\\angle BFE=\\angle DFC$ by vertical angles and $\\angle BEF=\\angle CDF=90^\\circ$, so $\\angle FBE=\\angle FCD$, which is equal to 30 degrees.  Now summing the angles in $\\triangle ABC$, we have $60^\\circ+30^\\circ+3y+y+30^\\circ=180$, solving yields $4y=60$ so $y=15$ and we see $\\triangle BDC$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Also, $\\triangle ABD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle.\n\nLet $ AD = x$, so $AB = 2x$ and $DB = DC = x\\sqrt{3}$. $BC = x\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{2} = x\\sqrt{6}$.  We are given that this equals 12, so we find $x = 12/\\sqrt{6} = 2\\sqrt{6}$.  It follows that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ can be found via  \\[(1/2)(AC)(BD)=(1/2)(x+x\\sqrt{3})(x\\sqrt{3})=12\\sqrt{3}+36.\\] To find $EC$, notice that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ can also be written as $(1/2)(AB)(EC)$.  Thus, \\[(1/2)(4\\sqrt{6})(EC)=12\\sqrt{3}+36 \\Rightarrow EC = 3(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}).\\]  Hence $a=3$, $b=2$, and $c=6$, so $a+b+c=\\boxed{11}$.",
