Thus, denoting the side length of $BEFC$ as $x$, we can create the ratios: $\\frac{28}{x} = \\frac{x}{58} \\Rightarrow x^2 = 1624$, and since $x^2$ is the area of square $BCFE$, $\\boxed{1624}$ is the answer.",

The lengths of $AB$ and $CD$ are provided as 28 units and 58 units, respectively. We need to find the area of the inscribed square $BCFE$.\n\n\n## Step 2: Identify key properties of the figure\nLet's denote the side length of the square as $x$. Since the square is inscribed in the right triangle, $\\angle CDF = \\angle AEB = 90^{\\circ}$, and $\\angle BAE = \\angle CFD$. This implies that $\\triangle AEB \\sim \\triangle FDC$ by Angle-Angle Similarity.\n\n\n## Step 3: Establish the relationship between the sides of the triangles\nUsing the similarity of $\\triangle AEB$ and $\\triangle FDC$, we can establish the following proportion: $\\frac{AB}{x} = \\frac{x}{CD}$.\n\n\n## Step 4: Substitute the given values into the proportion\nWe can now! substitute the given values of $AB = 28$ and $CD = 58$ into the proportion: $\\frac{28",
