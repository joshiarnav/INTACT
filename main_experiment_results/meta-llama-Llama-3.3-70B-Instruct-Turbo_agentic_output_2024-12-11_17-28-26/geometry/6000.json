Now, we have a regular tetrahedron $EFGH$, which by symmetry has twice the volume of our original solid. This tetrahedron has side length $2s = 12\\sqrt{2}$. Using the formula for the volume of a regular tetrahedron, which is $V = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}S^3}{12}$, where S is the side length of the tetrahedron, the volume of our original solid is:\n$V = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot (12\\sqrt{2})^3}{12} = \\boxed{288}$.",
