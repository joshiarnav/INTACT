Let $a = BC$, $b = AC$, $c = AB$, and $\\alpha = \\angle AXB$. Remark that\\[\\angle AI_1B = 180^\\circ - (\\angle I_1AB + \\angle I_1BA) = 180^\\circ - \\tfrac12(180^\\circ - \\alpha) = 90^\\circ + \\tfrac\\alpha 2.\\]Applying the Law of Sines to $\\triangle ABI_1$ gives\\[\\frac{AI_1}{AB} = \\frac{\\sin\\angle ABI_1}{\\sin\\angle AI_1B}\\qquad\\Rightarrow\\qquad AI_1 = \\frac{c\\sin\\frac B2}{\\cos\\frac\\alpha 2}.\\]Analogously one can derive $AI_2 = \\tfrac{b\\sin\\frac C2}{\\sin\\frac\\alpha 2}$, and so\\[[AI_1I_2] = \\frac{bc\\sin\\frac A2 \\sin\\frac B2\\sin\\frac C2}{2\\cos\\frac\\alpha 2\\sin\\frac\\alpha 2} = \\frac{bc\\sin\\frac A2 \\sin\\frac B2\\sin\\frac C2}{\\sin\\alpha}\\geq bc\\sin\\frac A2 \\sin\\frac B2\\sin\\frac C2,\\]with equality when $\\alpha = 90^\\circ$, that is, when $X$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to $\\overline{BC}$. In this case the desired area is $bc\\sin\\tfrac A2\\sin\\tfrac B2\\sin\\tfrac C2$. To make this feasible to compute, note that\\[\\sin\\frac A2=\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\cos A}2}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}}2} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{(a-b+c)(a+b-c)}{4bc}}.\\]Applying similar logic to $\\sin \\tfrac B2$ and $\\sin\\tfrac C2$ and simplifying yields a final answer of\\begin{align*}bc\\sin\\frac A2\\sin\\frac B2\\sin\\frac C2&=bc\\cdot\\dfrac{(a-b+c)(b-c+a)(c-a+b)}{8abc}\\\\&=\\dfrac{(30-32+34)(32-34+30)(34-30+32)}{8\\cdot 32}=\\boxed{126}.\\end{align*}",
