    "problem": "A triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units. The length of the third side is $x$ units, where $x$ is an integer. What is the largest possible perimeter of the triangle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to first consider the Triangle Inequality Theorem. This theorem states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. \n\nLet's apply this theorem to the given sides of length 5 and 6 units, and the unknown third side of length x units. We get the following inequalities:\n- 5 + 6 > x\n- 5 + x > 6\n- 6 + x > 5\n\nSimplifying these inequalities, we get:\n- 11 > x\n- x > 1\n- x > -1 \n\nSince x must be an integer and the length of a side cannot be negative, we can disregard the last inequality and consider only the first two. The first inequality tells us that x must be less than 11, and the second inequality tells us that x must be greater than 1. \n\nNow, we have a range for x: 1 < x < 11. Since x is an integer, the possible values for x are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nTo find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to find the largest possible value of x within the given range. Since the largest possible value of x is 9 (from the range 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), we can calculate the largest possible perimeter by adding the lengths of all three sides: 5 + 6 + 9 = 20.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible perimeter of the triangle is $\\boxed{20}$.",
