    "solution": "To make the $8$ triangles have the same area, the base must be divided into $8$ segments of length $1$ inch each.  Define points $A$, $B_0$, $B_1$, $B_2$, $B_3$, and $B_4$ as in the figure.  For $0\\leq k\\leq 3$, the perimeter $P(k)$ of triangle $A B_k B_{k+1}$ in inches is \\[\nP(k)=1+\\sqrt{10^2+k^2}+\\sqrt{10^2+(k+1)^2},\n\\]where each distance $A B_k$ is calculated by applying the Pythagorean theorem to right triangle $A B_0 B_k$.  Since $P(k)$ increases as $k$ increases, its largest value is $P(3)=1+\\sqrt{100+3^2}+\\sqrt{100+4^2}$, which to the nearest hundredth is $\\boxed{22.21}$ inches.

Since the area of each piece is 5 square inches and the height of the original triangle is 10 inches, the height of each piece can be determined.\nLet's denote the height of each piece as h. Since the area of each trapezoid is 5 square inches, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid: Area = (1/2) * (sum of the lengths of the bases) * h. We know that the area is 5, but we need the lengths of the bases to proceed.\n\n## Step 6: To find the lengths of the bases of each trapezoid, we need to understand the relationship between the cuts and the dimensions of the original triangle. The cuts are parallel to the base, so each cut creates a smaller triangle that is similar to the original triangle.\nBy similarity, the ratio of the height of the smaller triangle to the height of the original triangle is equal to the ratio of the base of the smaller triangle to the base of the original triangle.
