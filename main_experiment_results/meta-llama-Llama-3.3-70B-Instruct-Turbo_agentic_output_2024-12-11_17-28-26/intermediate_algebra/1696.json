    "solution": "Since $z^2 = 24-32i$, we must have $|z^2| = |24-32i| = |8(3-4i)| = 8|3-4i| = 8(5) = 40$.  We also have $|z|^2 = |z|\\cdot |z| = |(z)(z)| = |z^2|$, so $|z^2| = 40$ means that $|z|^2 = 40$, which gives us $|z| = \\sqrt{40} = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{10}}$.",

Given $z^2 = 24-32i$, we can find the magnitude of $z^2$ using the formula $|a+bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. \n\nSo, $|z^2| = |24-32i| = \\sqrt{24^2 + (-32)^2} = \\sqrt{576 + 1024} = \\sqrt{1600} = 40$. \n\nThis is the first step. We will use this result to find $|z|$ in the next step.\nWe have found that $|z^2| = 40$. The next step is to use the property of complex numbers that states $|z^2| = |z|^2$. This means that the magnitude of $z^2$ is equal to the square of the magnitude of $z$. \n\nSo, we have $|z|^2 = |z^2| = 40$. To find $|z|$, we take the square root of both sides: $|z| = \\sqrt{40} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 10} = \\sqrt{4} \\cdot \\sqrt{10} = 2\\sqrt{10}$.\n\nTherefore, $|z| = 2\\sqrt{10}$, but since we are following a step-by-step process, we will wait for the confirmation that this is the final step before boxing the answer. \n\nNext step (if final step use $\\boxed{answer}$): $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{10}}$",
