    "problem": "One of the roots of\n\\[ax^3 + 3x^2 + bx - 65 = 0,\\]is $-2 - 3i,$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.  Find the real root of this cubic polynomial.",

    "solution": "Since $-2 - 3i$ is a root\n\\[a (-2 - 3i)^3 + 3 (-2 - 3i)^2 + b (-2 - 3i) - 65 = 0.\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[(-80 + 46a - 2b) + (36 - 9a - 3b)i = 0.\\]Then $-80 + 46a - 2b = 0$ and $36 - 9a - 3b = 0.$  Solving, we find $a = 2$ and $b = 6.$\n\nThe cubic polynomial is then $2x^3 + 3x^2 + 6x - 65 = 0,$ which factors as $(2x - 5)(x^2 + 4x + 13) = 0.$  Therefore, the real root is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the Complex Conjugate Root Theorem\nThe Complex Conjugate Root Theorem states that if a polynomial equation with real coefficients has a complex root, then its conjugate is also a root of the polynomial. Since $-2 - 3i$ is a root of the given cubic polynomial, its complex conjugate, $-2 + 3i$, is also a root.\n\n## Step 2: Form the quadratic polynomial with the given roots\nUsing the roots $-2 - 3i$ and $-2 + 3i$, we can form a quadratic polynomial that has these roots. The product of the roots is $(-2 - 3i)(-2 + 3i) = (-2)^2 - (3i)^2 = 4 + 9 = 13$. The sum of the roots is $(-2 - 3i) + (-2 + 3i) = -4$. Thus, the quadratic polynomial is $x^2 + 4x + 13$.\n\n## Step 3: Factor the cubic polynomial\nGiven that $x^2 + 4x + 13$ is a factor of the cubic polynomial $ax",
