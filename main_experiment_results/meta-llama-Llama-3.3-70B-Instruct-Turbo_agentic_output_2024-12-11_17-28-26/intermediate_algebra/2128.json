    "problem": "One of the asymptotes of a hyperbola has equation $y=3x.$ The foci of the hyperbola have the same $x-$coordinate, which is $5.$ Find the equation of the other asymptote of the hyperbola, giving your answer in the form \"$y = mx + b$\".",

    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Because the foci both lie on the line $x=5$ and the center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the segment connecting the foci, the center must also lie on the line $x=5.$ However, we also know that the asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at the center. Therefore, the center of the hyperbola lies on both the line $x=5$ and the line $y=3x,$ so its coordinates are $(5, 15).$\n\nBecause the hyperbola has a horizontal axis, the other asymptote must have slope $-3.$ Therefore, we can write a point-slope equation for the other asymptote: \\[y - 15 = -3(x - 5),\\]which is equivalent to $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}.$",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To find the equation of the other asymptote of the hyperbola, we first note that since the foci have the same x-coordinate (5), the center of the hyperbola must also lie on this vertical line. Additionally, the asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at the center. Since we are given one of the asymptotes as y = 3x, the center must lie on this line as well. \n\nSo, we can find the y-coordinate of the center by plugging x = 5 into y = 3x. This gives us y = 3 * 5 = 15. Thus, the coordinates of the center are (5, 15).\nSince the center of the hyperbola is at (5, 15) and one of the asymptotes is y = 3x, the other asymptote must be symmetric with respect to the center. This means that the slope of the other asymptote will be the negative of the slope of the given asymptote. \n\nThe slope of the given asymptote is 3, so the slope of the other asymptote will be -3. Now we can use the point-slope form of a line, y - y1 = m(x - x1), where (x1, y1) is the point on the line (in this case, the center of the hyperbola) and m is the slope. \n\nPlugging in the values, we get y - 15 = -3(x - 5). Simplifying this equation, we get y - 15 = -3x + 15, which further simplifies to y = -3x + 30.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the other asymptote of the hyperbola is $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}$.",
