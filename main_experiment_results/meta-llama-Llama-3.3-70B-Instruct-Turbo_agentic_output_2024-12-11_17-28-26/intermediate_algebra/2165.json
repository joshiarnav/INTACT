    "model_solution": "To find the remainder when $6x^4-14x^3-4x^2+2x-26$ is divided by $2x - 6$, we will use polynomial long division or synthetic division. However, since $2x - 6$ is a linear divisor, we can also directly apply the Remainder Theorem for a quicker solution. \n\nThe first step is to recognize that the divisor $2x - 6$ can be written as $2(x - 3)$, which means we are interested in the value of $x$ that makes $2x - 6 = 0$. Solving $2x - 6 = 0$ gives $x = 3$. \n\nAccording to the Remainder Theorem, the remainder of the division of a polynomial $f(x)$ by $x - c$ (or in this case, $2(x - 3)$) is $f(c)$. Therefore, we will substitute $x = 3$ into the polynomial $6x^4-14x^3-4x^2+2x-26$ to find the remainder.\nTo find the remainder, we substitute $x = 3$ into the polynomial $6x^4-14x^3-4x^2+2x-26$.\n\nCalculating $6(3)^4 - 14(3)^3 - 4(3)^2 + 2(3) - 26$:\n\n$6(3)^4 = 6 \\times 81 = 486$,\n$14(3)^3 = 14 \\times 27 = 378$,\n$4(3)^2 = 4 \\times 9 = 36$,\n$2(3) = 6$.\n\nSubstituting these values back into the equation gives:\n$486 - 378 - 36 + 6 - 26$.\n\nPerforming the subtraction and addition:\n$486 - 378 = 108$,\n$108 - 36 = 72$,\n$72 + 6 = 78$,\n$78 - 26 = 52$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $6x^4-14x^3-4x^2+2x-26$ is divided by $2x - 6$ is $52$.\nThe final step is to confirm that the calculation is complete and accurate. Since we have correctly applied the Remainder Theorem by substituting $x = 3$ into the polynomial and performed the arithmetic operations, we can conclude that the remainder is indeed $52$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $6x^4-14x^3-4x^2+2x-26$ is divided by $2x - 6$ is $\\boxed{52}$.",
