By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, we know that $x+4, x+4, x+1, x+6$ are all the linear factors of the polynomial, so the quadratic factors can only be multiplied from these linear factors.\nThere are only two possible distinct groupings (not counting rearrangements) -- $(x^2 + 8x + 16)(x^2 + 7x + 6)$ and $(x^2 + 5x + 4)(x^2 + 10x + 24)$. In the first case, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 405$, and in the second case, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 717$. The largest of the two options is $\\boxed{717}$.",
