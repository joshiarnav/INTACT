    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block. We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$. Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{26}$, we need to perform long division. \n\nDividing 3 by 26 using long division, we get: \n0.115384615384... \n\nThis is a repeating decimal, with the repeating block being 115384. \n\nNow we need to find the 100th digit after the decimal point in this repeating decimal. \n\nWe'll proceed with the next step to find this digit.\n## Step 1: Identify the length of the repeating block in the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{26}$.\nThe repeating block in the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{26}$ is 115384, which has a length of 6 digits.\n\n## Step 2: Determine how many complete cycles of the repeating block occur before reaching the 100th digit after the decimal point.\nTo find the number of complete cycles of the repeating block, we divide the position of the digit we are interested in (100) by the length of the repeating block (6). 100 divided by 6 gives 16 with a remainder of 4.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the position of the digit within the repeating block that corresponds to the 100th digit after the decimal point.\nSince 16 complete cycles of the repeating block consist of $16 \\times 6 = 96$ digits, the 100th digit will be the 4th digit in the repeating block, because $100 - 96 = 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the digit in the 4th position of the repeating block.\nThe repeating block is 115384.
