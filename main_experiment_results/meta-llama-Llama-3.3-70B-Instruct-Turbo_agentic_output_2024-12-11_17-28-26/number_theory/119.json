    "problem": "In a physical education class, students line up in four rows to do exercises. One particular class has over 30 students, with three rows having the same number of students and one row having one more student than the other three rows. What is the smallest possible class size for this physical education class?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If the first three rows have 1 student, the last row must have two students, so there are 5 students in total. This is not greater than 30, so we must add another student to each row. This gives 9, which is still not greater than 30. We have to keep adding 4 until we get to a number greater than 30. As a result, we reach 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33. 33 is the first integer greater than 30, so this class has $\\boxed{33}$ students.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To find the smallest possible class size, let's denote the number of students in each of the three equal rows as 'x'. Since one row has one more student than the other three rows, the number of students in that row is 'x + 1'. The total number of students can be represented as 3x + (x + 1). \n\nThis gives us the equation: Total students = 3x + x + 1 = 4x + 1. \n\nWe know that the total number of students is over 30. So, the next step is to find the smallest value of 'x' that satisfies this condition.\nTo find the smallest possible class size, we need to find the smallest value of 'x' that makes the total number of students greater than 30. \n\nThe equation for the total number of students is: Total students = 4x + 1.\n\nSince the total number of students must be greater than 30, we can set up the inequality: 4x + 1 > 30.\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides of the inequality: 4x > 29.\n\nDivide both sides of the inequality by 4: x > 7.25.\n\nSince 'x' must be a whole number (as it represents the number of students in each row), the smallest possible value of 'x' is 8.\n\nNow, we can calculate the smallest possible class size by substituting 'x' into the equation: Total students = 4x + 1 = 4(8) + 1 = 32 + 1 = 33.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible class size for this physical education class is $\\boxed{33}$.",
