It follows that the sum of the divisors is equal to $(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4)(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3)$, as each factor of $432$ is represented when the product is expanded.

For a number in the form of $a^m * b^n$, where $a$ and $b$ are prime factors and $m$ and $n$ are their powers, the sum of its divisors (including itself) is given by $(1 + a + a^2 + ... + a^m)(1 + b + b^2 + ... + b^n)$.

For the prime factor $2^4$, the sum of its divisors is $1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31$.

So, the total sum of divisors is $31 * 40 = 1240$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the sum of proper divisors for $432$\nThe sum of proper divisors is the total sum of divisors minus the number itself. Therefore, the sum of proper divisors of $432$ is $1240 - 432 = 808$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{808}$",
