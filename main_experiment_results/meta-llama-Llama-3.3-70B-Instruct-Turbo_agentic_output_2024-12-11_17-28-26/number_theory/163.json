    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits, let's start by understanding the properties of numbers divisible by 9. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 9. \n\nSince we're looking for the smallest four-digit number, we'll start with the smallest possible thousands digit, which is 1. This will be one of our odd digits.\nTo continue with the solution, let's consider the smallest possible four-digit number starting with 1. We have 1 as one of our odd digits. For the smallest possible number, we want the other odd digit to be as small as possible as well. The next smallest odd digit after 1 is 3.\n\nSo far, our number looks like 1 _ _ 3 or 1 3 _ _, with 1 and 3 being our two odd digits. Now, we need to find two even digits to complete the number.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Let's calculate the sum of our current digits: 1 + 3 = 4. We need to find two even digits whose sum, when added to 4, results in a number divisible by 9.\n\nThe smallest possible even digits are 0 and 2, but 0 + 2 + 4 = 6, which is not divisible by 9. The next combination could be 0 and 4, but 0 + 4 + 4 = 8, which is also not divisible by 9. The next possible combination is 0 and\nTo find the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits, let's continue from where we left off.\n\nWe have 1 as one of our odd digits and 3 as the other. The sum of these digits is 1 + 3 = 4. We need to find two even digits whose sum, when added to 4, results in a number divisible by 9.\n\nWe've tried !0 + 2! and !0 + 4!, but neither combination worked. The next possible combination is !0 + 6! or !2 + 4!, but !0 + 6 + 4 = 10! and !2 + 4 + 4 = 10!, which are also not divisible by 9. \n\nHowever, if we try !0 + 8!, we get !0 + 8 + 4 = 12!, which is still not divisible by 9. The next combination could be !2 + 6!, but !2 + 6 + 4 = 12!, which is also not divisible by 9.\n\nLet's try !4 + 6!. Then, !4 + 6 + 4 =\nTo continue with the solution, let's calculate the sum of the digits for the combination 4 + 6. \n\nWe have 1 + 3 = 4 as the sum of our odd digits. Now, we add 4 + 6 to this sum: 4 + 4 + 6 = 14. This is still not divisible by 9.\n\nHowever, if we try the next possible combination, which is 4 + 8, we get: 4 + 4 + 8 = 16, which is also not divisible by 9.\n\nThe next combination could be 6 + 8, but 4 + 6 + 8 = 18, which is divisible by 9. \n\nSo, we have found two even digits, 6 and 8 (or 8 and 6, since order doesn't matter for this step), whose sum, when added to the sum of our odd digits, results in a number divisible by 9.\n\nNow, we need to arrange these digits to form the smallest possible four-digit number. We already have 1 as the thousands digit.

Then, we have 6 and 8 left. To minimize the number, the smaller of the two remaining digits, 6, should go in the tens place, and 8 should go in the units place.\n\nSo, the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits is 1368.\n\n$\\boxed{1368}$",
