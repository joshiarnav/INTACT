    "solution": "We begin by converting $233_{10}$ into base-4. Since $4^3=64$ is the largest power of 4 that is less than 233, and $3\\cdot64=192$ is the largest multiple of 64 that is less than 233, the coefficient of the $4^3$ term will be 3. From here, we are left with a remainder of $233-192=41$. The largest power of 4 that is less than this number is $4^2=16$, and the largest multiple of 16 that is less than 41 is $2\\cdot16=32$. This leaves us with $41-32=9$, which we can express as $2\\cdot4^1+1\\cdot4^0$. So, we find that $233_{10}=3\\cdot4^3+2\\cdot4^2+2\\cdot{4^1}+1\\cdot4^0=3221_4$, which has $\\boxed{2}$ odd digits.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of odd digits in the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$, the first step is to convert the decimal number 233 to its base-4 equivalent. This involves dividing 233 by 4 and noting the remainder, then dividing the quotient by 4 and noting the remainder, and repeating this process until the quotient becomes 0. \n\n233 \u00f7 4 = 58 remainder 1.\nTo continue converting 233 to its base-4 equivalent, we'll take the quotient from the previous division, which is 58, and divide it by 4.\n\n58 \u00f7 4 = 14 remainder 2.\n\nNext, we'll divide the new quotient, 14, by 4.\n\n14 \u00f7 4 = 3 remainder 2.\n\nThen, we'll divide the new quotient, 3, by 4.\n\n3 \u00f7 4 = 0 remainder 3.\n\nNow that the quotient is 0, we can stop. The base-4 representation of $233_{10}$ is $3221_4$ (reading the remainders from bottom to top). \n\nTo find the number of odd digits in $3221_4$, we'll identify the odd digits.
