    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, let's start by considering the possible hundreds digits. Since we want the largest three-digit integer, we should start with the largest possible hundreds digit, which is 9. \n\nThis means the number will be in the form of 9xy, where x and y are the tens and units digits, respectively. We will consider the possible values of x and y in the next step.\nTo continue solving the problem, let's analyze the possible values of x and y. Since the number 9xy must be divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, x and y cannot be 0. Also, x and y must be distinct from each other and from 9.\n\nWe can start by trying the largest possible value for x, which is 8, since x cannot be 9. If x = 8, then 9xy must be divisible by 8 and 9. For a number to be divisible by 8, its last three digits (in this case, xy) must be divisible by 8. \n\nLet's try to find the largest possible value of y such that 8y is divisible by 8. The largest possible value of y that satisfies this condition is 6, since 86 is divisible by 2 but not by 8, and 88 is not a valid option because the digits must be distinct.\n\nHowever, we also need to ensure that 986 is divisible by 9.
