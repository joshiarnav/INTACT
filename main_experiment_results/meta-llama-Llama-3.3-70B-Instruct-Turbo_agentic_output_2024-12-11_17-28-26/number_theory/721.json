    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The first odd multiple of 3 is 3. The next is 9, then 15, 21, adding 6 each time. The $n$th odd multiple of 3 is $6n-3$; the 10th odd multiple of 3 is therefore $60-3=\\boxed{57}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3, let's start by identifying the pattern of such numbers. Odd multiples of 3 are numbers that can be divided by 3 without a remainder and are also odd. The first few odd multiples of 3 are 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, and so on. These numbers can be represented as 3 * 1, 3 * 3, 3 * 5, 3 * 7, 3 * 9, etc., where the multiplier (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...) is an odd number.\nTo find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3, we need to continue the pattern of odd multipliers. The sequence of odd multipliers is 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19. \n\nSince we are looking for the tenth number, we will use the tenth odd multiplier, which is 19. The tenth odd multiple of 3 can be calculated as 3 * 19 = 57.\n\nTherefore, the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is $\\boxed{57}$.",
