    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The units digit of $mn$ is $1^6 = 1$.  Searching for a units digit for $n$ (which is clearly odd), we find that $7 \\cdot 3 = 1$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit of $n$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To find the units digit of $n$, we first note that the units digit of $mn$ is the product of the units digits of $m$ and $n$. Since $mn = 21^6$, the units digit of $mn$ is the same as the units digit of $1^6$, which is 1. We are also given that the units digit of $m$ is 7. \n\nSo, we have: units digit of $m$ * units digit of $n$ = units digit of $mn$, which translates to $7 *$ units digit of $n$ = 1.\nTo find the units digit of $n$, we need to solve the equation $7 \\times$ units digit of $n$ = 1. Since we are dealing with units digits, we are essentially looking for a single-digit number that, when multiplied by 7, gives a units digit of 1.\n\nWe know that $7 \\times 3 = 21$, which means the units digit of this product is 1. Therefore, the units digit of $n$ must be 3, because $7 \\times 3$ equals 21, and the units digit of 21 is 1.\n\n$\\boxed{3}$",
