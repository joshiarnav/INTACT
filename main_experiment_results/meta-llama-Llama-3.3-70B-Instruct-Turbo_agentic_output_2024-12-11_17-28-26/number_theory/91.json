    "problem": "For some positive integer $k$, when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. What is the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$, we first need to determine the possible values of $k$. We are given that when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. This can be expressed as:\n\n$60 = q \\cdot k^2 + 6$\n\nwhere $q$ is the quotient. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\n$60 - 6 = q \\cdot k^2$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$54 = q \\cdot k^2$\n\nSince $54 = 2 \\cdot 3^3$, the possible values of $k^2$ are the divisors of 54 that are perfect squares. The divisors of 54 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54, and the perfect squares among them are 1 and 9. \n\nTherefore, $k^2$ can be 1 or 9, which means $k$ can be 1 or 3.\nTo find the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$, we need to consider the possible values of $k$ that we found in the previous step, which are 1 and 3.\n\nIf $k = 1$, then when 100 is divided by $k$, the remainder is 0, because 100 is exactly divisible by 1.\n\nIf $k = 3$, then when 100 is divided by $k$, we can perform the division to find the remainder: \n\n100 \u00f7 3 = 33 with a remainder of 1.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$ can be either 0 or 1. However, since $k$ must be a positive integer greater than 1 (because $k^2$ is a divisor of 54 and $k^2$ is not 1), $k$ cannot be 1. \n\nSo, the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
