    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since $2 \\cdot 93 \\equiv 186 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$, $2^{-1} \\equiv \\boxed{93} \\pmod{185}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find $2^{-1} \\pmod{185}$, we first need to understand what this means. The expression $2^{-1} \\pmod{185}$ refers to the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 185. In other words, we are looking for an integer x such that $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$. \n\nThe first step is to check if 2 and 185 are coprime, which is necessary for the multiplicative inverse to exist. We can do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2 and 185. Since 2 is a prime number and 185 is not a multiple of 2, the GCD of 2 and 185 is 1, meaning they are coprime.\nTo find the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 185, we need to solve the equation $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$. Since 2 and 185 are coprime, we know that this inverse exists.\n\nOne method to find the multiplicative inverse is to use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. However, for small numbers, we can also proceed by trial and error or by using properties of modular arithmetic.\n\nIn this case, we can observe that $2 \\times 93 = 186$, which is $1 \\pmod{185}$ because $186 = 185 + 1$. Therefore, $93$ is the multiplicative inverse of $2$ modulo $185$ because $2 \\times 93 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$.\n\nThus, the solution to $2^{-1} \\pmod{185}$ is $\\boxed{93}$.",
