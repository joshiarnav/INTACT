    "problem": "Three different natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors. How many factors does $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ have?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",

    "model_solution": "To begin solving this problem, let's recall what it means for a natural number to have exactly three natural-number factors. A natural number with exactly three factors must be the square of a prime number, because its factors would then be 1, the prime number itself, and the square of the prime number.\n\nSo, we can express $x$, $y$, and $z$ as $x = p^2$, $y = q^2$, and $z = r^2$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are distinct prime numbers. \n\nThis is the starting point for solving the problem. Next, we would express $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ in terms of $p$, $q$, and $r$.\nTo express $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ in terms of $p$, $q$, and $r$, we substitute $x = p^2$, $y = q^2$, and $z = r^2$ into the expression.\n\nSo, $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ becomes $(p^2)^2(q^2)^3(r^2)^4 = p^4q^6r^8$.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of factors of $p^4q^6r^8$. The number of factors of any number in the form $a^m*b^n*c^o...$ (where $a$, $b$, $c$, ... are distinct prime numbers) is calculated by multiplying together one more than each of the exponents: $(m+1)*(n+1)*(o+1)...$. \n\nApplying this rule to $p^4q^6r^8$, the number of factors is $(4+1)*(6+1)*(8+1) = 5*7*9$.\n\nCalculating this product gives us the total number of factors of $x^{2}y\nTo find the total number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$, we calculate the product $5*7*9$.\n\n$5*7*9 = 315$\n\nTherefore, the total number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ is $\\boxed{315}$.",
