    "problem": "Chloe wants to buy a hoodie that costs $\\$32.75$. She empties her wallet and finds she only has three $\\$10$ bills, eight quarters, and a pile of dimes. What is the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie?",

    "solution": "Let $n$ represent the unknown number of dimes. Chloe's total amount of money is $$3(\\$10)+8(\\$.25)+n(\\$.10) \\ge \\$32.75.$$Simplifying gives  \\begin{align*}\n30+2+.10n &\\ge 32.75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\n.10n &\\ge .75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge \\frac{.75}{.10} \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge 7.5.\n\\end{align*}Chloe must have at least $\\boxed{8}$ dimes in her pile.",

    "model_solution": "To find the minimum number of dimes Chloe needs, we first need to calculate how much money she already has from the three $10 bills and the eight quarters.\n\nThree $10 bills equal $30.\nEight quarters equal $2, since each quarter is $0.25 and 8 * $0.25 = $2.\nSo, Chloe has $30 + $2 = $32 from the bills and quarters. \n\nNow, we need to figure out how much more money she needs to buy the $32.75 hoodie.\nTo find out how much more money Chloe needs, we subtract the total amount she already has ($32) from the price of the hoodie ($32.75).\n\n$32.75 (hoodie price) - $32 (money she has) = $0.75\n\nSo, Chloe needs an additional $0.75 to pay for the hoodie. Since each dime is worth $0.10, we need to find out how many dimes are required to make $0.75.\n\nTo do this, we divide $0.75 by $0.10 (the value of one dime).\n\n$0.75 \u00f7 $0.10 = 7.5\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a dime, Chloe needs to have at least 8 dimes to have enough money (because 7 dimes would only be $0.70, which is less than the $0.75 needed).\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of dimes Chloe must have is $\\boxed{8}$.",
