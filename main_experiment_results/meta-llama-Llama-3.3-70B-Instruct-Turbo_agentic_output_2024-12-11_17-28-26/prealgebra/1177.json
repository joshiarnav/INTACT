    "problem": "In a right triangle with integer length sides, the hypotenuse has length 39 units. How many units is the length of the shorter leg?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since they only ask for one length, you can assume that there's only one possible triangle.  Then, quickly note that $39 = 3\\cdot 13$, and that 5 - 12 - 13 is a Pythagorean triple.  Therefore, the shorter leg has length $\\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's start by recalling the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b): a^2 + b^2 = c^2. \n\nGiven that the hypotenuse has a length of 39 units, we can set up the equation as follows: a^2 + b^2 = 39^2. \n\nNow we need to find integer values of a and b that satisfy this equation, with a being the shorter leg. We'll look for Pythagorean triples or use trial and error to find possible combinations of a and b.\nTo find the integer values of a and b that satisfy the equation a^2 + b^2 = 39^2, we can start by calculating 39^2, which is 1521. So the equation becomes a^2 + b^2 = 1521.\n\nWe know that a is the shorter leg, so we can start by trying small integer values for a and calculating b^2 = 1521 - a^2 to see if b is also an integer.\n\nLet's try a few values for a:\n- If a = 1, then b^2 = 1521 - 1 = 1520, which is not a perfect square.\n- If a = 2, then b^2 = 1521 - 4 = 1517, which is not a perfect square.\n- If a = 3, then b^2 = 1521 - 9 = 1512, which is not a perfect square.\n- If a = 4, then b^2 = 1521 - 16 = 1505, which is not a perfect square.\n- If a = 5, then b^2 = 1521 - 25 = 149\nTo continue, let's try a few more values for a:\n- If a = 5, then b^2 = 1521 - 25 = 1496, which is not a perfect square.\n- If a = 6, then b^2 = 1521 - 36 = 1485, which is not a perfect square.\n- If a = 7, then b^2 = 1521 - 49 = 1472, which is not a perfect square.\n- If a = 8, then b^2 = 1521 - 64 = 1457, which is not a perfect square.\n- If a = 9, then b^2 = 1521 - 81 = 1440, which is not a perfect square.\n- If a = 10, then b^2 = 1521 - 100 = 1421, which is not a perfect square.\n- If a = 11, then b^2 = 1521 - 121 = 1400, which is not a perfect square.\n- If a = 12, then b^2 = 1521 - 144 = 1377, which is not a\nTo continue, let's try a few more values for a:\n- If a = 12, then b^2 = 1521 - 144 = 1377, which is not a perfect square.\n- If a = 13, then b^2 = 1521 - 169 = 1352, which is not a perfect square.\n- If a = 14, then b^2 = 1521 - 196 = 1325, which is not a perfect square.\n- If a = 15, then b^2 = 1521 - 225 = 1296, which is a perfect square (36^2 = 1296).\nSo, we have found a possible combination: a = 15 and b = 36.\n\nSince we are looking for the length of the shorter leg, we can conclude that the length of the shorter leg is 15 units.\n\n$\\boxed{15}$",
