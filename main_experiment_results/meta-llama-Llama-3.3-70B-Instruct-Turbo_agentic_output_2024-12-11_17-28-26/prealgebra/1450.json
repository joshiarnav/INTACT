    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "A product is what you get when you multiply things together. To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators together to get the new numerator. So, the numerator is $1\\times3=3$.\n\nThen, multiply the denominators together to get the new denominator. $5\\times7 = 35$. Therefore our answer is:  \\[\\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{35}}.\\]",
