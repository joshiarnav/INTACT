    "problem": "How many integers between 1 and 200 are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Integers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 must be multiples of 15.  We can start by listing the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200: $$15,30,45,60,75,90,105,120,135,150,165,180,195$$ Checking only the even numbers, we can eliminate those that are multiples of 4, leaving us with: $$15,30,45,75,90,105,135,150,165,195$$ Finally, we need to eliminate any remaining multiples of 7.  The only multiples of 7 we need to be concerned with are those ending in 5 or 0.  The only number on the list that is a multiple of 7 is 105.  Our final list is: $$15,30,45,75,90,135,150,165,195$$ This leaves us with $\\boxed{9}$ integers.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps. \n\nStep 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5. The multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ... and the multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ... . The smallest number that appears in both lists is 15, which is the LCM of 3 and 5. This means that any number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5 must be a multiple of 15.\n\nWe will use this information to proceed with the next step.\n## Step 2: Determine the total number of multiples of 15 between 1 and 200.\nTo find the number of multiples of 15 between 1 and 200, we divide 200 by 15. This gives us 200 / 15 = 13.333, which means that there are 13 multiples of 15 between 1 and 200.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 4 between 1 and 200.\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 4 is 60. The multiples of 60 between 1 and 200 are 60, 120, and 180. Therefore, there are 3 multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 4 between 1 and 200.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 7 between 1 and 200.\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 7 is 105. The only multiple of 105 between 1 and 200 is 105. Therefore, there is 1 multiple of 15 that is also a multiple of 7 between 1 and 200.\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of multiples of 15 that are not multiples of either 4 or 7 between 1 and 200.\nTo find the total number of multiples of 15 that are not multiples of either 4 or 7, we subtract the number of multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 4 and the number of multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 7 from the total number of multiples of 15. However, we need to check if there's any overlap (numbers that are multiples of both 4 and 7) to avoid double subtraction.\n\nThe LCM of 4 and 7 is 28, and the LCM of 15 and 28 is 420, which is greater than 200. This means there are no multiples of 15 between 1 and 200 that are also multiples of both 4 and 7. Therefore, no adjustment for overlap is needed.\n\nTotal multiples of 15 = 13\nMultiples of 15 that are also multiples of 4 = 3\nMultiples of 15 that are also multiples of 7 = 1\n\nTotal multiples of 15 not multiples of 4 or 7 = Total",
