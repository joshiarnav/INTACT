    "problem": "If $x^2 = y - 3$ and $x = -5$, then what is the value of $y$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Substituting $-5$ for $x$ in the first equation, we have $(-5)^2 = y-3$.  So $25=y-3$. Adding $3$ to both sides, $y=\\boxed{28}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of y, we need to substitute the given value of x into one of the equations. Since we are given x = -5, we can start by substituting this value into the equation x^2 = y - 3.\n\nSo, the first step is: \n(-5)^2 = y - 3\nWhich simplifies to: \n25 = y - 3\n\nNow we wait for the next instruction.\nTo solve for y, we need to isolate y on one side of the equation. Since 3 is being subtracted from y, we can add 3 to both sides of the equation to get y by itself.\n\nThe next step is:\n25 + 3 = y - 3 + 3\nWhich simplifies to:\n28 = y\n\nSince we have now isolated y, this is the final step.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28}$",
