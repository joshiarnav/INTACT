    "problem": "A toy store manager received a large order of Mr. Slinkums just in time for the holidays. The manager places $20\\%$ of them on the shelves, leaving the other 120 Mr. Slinkums in storage. How many Mr. Slinkums were in this order?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If $20\\%$ of the toys were put on the shelves, the $80\\%$ of the toys were left in storage.  Therefore, we are given $80\\% T=120$, where $T$ is the number of toys in the order.  Rewriting $80\\%$ as $\\frac{4}{5}$ and multiplying both sides by $\\frac{5}{4}$, we find that $T=120\\cdot\\frac{5}{4}=30\\cdot 5=\\boxed{150}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order, let's first identify what we know: \n- 20% of the Mr. Slinkums were placed on the shelves.\n- The remaining Mr. Slinkums, which is 80% of the total (since 100% - 20% = 80%), were left in storage, and this equals 120 Mr. Slinkums.\n\nLet's denote the total number of Mr. Slinkums as \"x\". We can then say that 80% of x equals 120. This can be represented as 0.80x = 120. \n\nWe'll solve for x in the equation 0.80x = 120 in the next step.\nTo solve for x, we'll divide both sides of the equation 0.80x = 120 by 0.80. \n\nx = 120 / 0.80\nx = 150\n\nTherefore, the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order is 150.\n\n$\\boxed{150}$",
