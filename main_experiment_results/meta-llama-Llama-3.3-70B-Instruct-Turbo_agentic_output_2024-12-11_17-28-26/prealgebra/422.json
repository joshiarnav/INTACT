    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "A circle's radius is half its diameter, so if the diameter of a circle is 4 meters, then its radius is 2 meters.  The area of the circle is $\\pi(\\text{radius})^2=\\pi(2\\text{ m})^2=\\boxed{4\\pi}$ square meters.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To find the area of the circle, we first need to find the radius of the circle. Since the diameter is given as 4 meters, the radius will be half of the diameter, which is $4 \\div 2 = 2$ meters.\nNow that we have the radius, we can use the formula for the area of a circle, which is $\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius. Plugging in the value of the radius, we get $\\pi (2)^2 = \\pi \\cdot 4 = 4\\pi$ square meters.\n\n$\\boxed{4\\pi}$",
