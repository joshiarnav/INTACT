    "problem": "Piravena must make a trip from $A$ to $B$, then from $B$ to $C$, then from $C$ to $A$.  Each of these three parts of the trip is made entirely by bus or entirely by airplane.  The cities form a right-angled triangle as shown, with $C$ a distance of 3000 km from $A$ and with $B$ a distance of 3250 km from $A$. To take a bus, it costs Piravena $\\$0.15$ per kilometer. To take an airplane, it costs her a $\\$100$ booking fee, plus $\\$0.10$ per kilometer.

    "solution": "Since $\\triangle ABC$ is a right-angled triangle, then we may use the Pythagorean Theorem.\nThus, $AB^2=BC^2+CA^2$, and so  \\begin{align*}\nBC^2&=AB^2-CA^2\\\\\n&=3250^2-3000^2\\\\\n&=250^2(13^2-12^2)\\\\\n&=250^2(5^2)\\\\\n&=1250^2.\n\\end{align*} therefore $BC=1250$ km (since $BC>0$).\nPiravena travels a distance of $3250+1250+3000=\\boxed{7500}$ km for her complete trip.",

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean theorem with the given distances to calculate the distance between B and C.\nLet's denote the distance between B and C as $d_{BC}$. Using the Pythagorean theorem: $d_{BC}^2 = d_{AB}^2 - d_{AC}^2$, where $d_{AB}$ is the distance between A and B, and $d_{AC}$ is the distance between A and C. Substituting the given values: $d_{BC}^2 = 3250^2 - 3000^2$.\n\n##",
