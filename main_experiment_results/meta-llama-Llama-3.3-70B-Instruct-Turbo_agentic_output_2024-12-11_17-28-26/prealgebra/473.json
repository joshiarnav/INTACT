    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To round $18.4851$ to the nearest hundredth, we must look at the hundreds and the thousands digits of the number in question. Since the thousands digit ($5$) is greater than or equal to $5$, the hundreds digit $8$ rounds up to $9$. Therefore, $18.4851$ rounded to the nearest hundredth is equal to $\\boxed{18.49}$.",

    "model_solution": "To round 18.4851 to the nearest hundredth, the first step is to look at the thousandth place, which is 5 in this case (the third digit after the decimal point).\nSince the digit in the thousandth place is 5, which is greater than or equal to 5, the next step is to round up the digit in the hundredth place. The digit in the hundredth place is 8, so rounding up gives 9. Therefore, 18.4851 rounded to the nearest hundredth is 18.49.\n\n$\\boxed{18.49}$",
