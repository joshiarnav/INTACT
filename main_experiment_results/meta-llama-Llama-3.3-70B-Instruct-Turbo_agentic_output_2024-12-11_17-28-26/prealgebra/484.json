    "problem": "A teacher has a class with $24$ students in it. If she wants to split the students into equal groups of at most $10$ students each, what is the least number of groups that she needs?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "For the teacher to be able to split her students into $x$ groups of $y$ students each, $y$ must be a divisor of $24$. Since we want to create as few groups as possible, we need to maximize the number of students in each group. Thus, $y$ should be the greatest divisor of $24$ that is less than or equal to $10$. This means that $y=8$ and $x=3$. The teacher can create $\\boxed{3}$ groups of $8$ students each.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least number of groups, we first need to identify the largest possible group size that is less than or equal to 10 students, since using the largest possible group size will result in the least number of groups. \n\nIn this case, the factors of 24 that are less than or equal to 10 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. The largest factor is 8, but we also need to consider if 24 can be divided evenly into groups larger than 8 but still less than or equal to 10, and that would be the factor that is closest to 10 without exceeding it, but still a divisor of 24. However, the next largest factor after 8 that is less than or equal to 10 is not a factor of 24. Therefore, the largest possible group size the teacher can use is 8 students per group, but we must verify if there's an even larger divisor of 24 that's less than or equal to 10, which in this context is not applicable as 8 is indeed the largest factor of 24 that meets the criteria.\nTo determine the least number of groups, we need to divide the total number of students (24) by the largest possible group size (8). \n\nNumber of groups = Total number of students / Group size\n= 24 / 8\n= 3\n\nSince 24 divided by 8 equals 3 with no remainder, the teacher can indeed split the students into equal groups of 8 students each with no students left over. Therefore, the least number of groups that the teacher needs is 3.\n\n$\\boxed{3}$",
