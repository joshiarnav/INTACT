The first step is to translate the given information into a mathematical equation.\n\nThe equation based on the given information is:\n(1/2) * (1/7) * T = (1/3) * (1/5) * 90\n\nThis equation represents the given statement: \"One-half of one-seventh of $T$ equals one-third of one-fifth of 90.\"\nTo find the value of $T$, we'll simplify and solve the equation.\n\nFirst, let's simplify both sides of the equation by calculating the products of the fractions:\n\n(1/2) * (1/7) = 1/14\n\n(1/3) * (1/5) = 1/15\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n(1/14) * T = (1/15) * 90\n\nNext, we'll multiply both sides by 14 to isolate $T$ on one side:\nT = (1/15) * 90 * 14\n\nNow, let's simplify the right side:\nT = (90 * 14) / 15\n\nCalculate the product of 90 and 14:\n90 * 14 = 1260\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\nT = 1260 / 15\n\nNow, divide 1260 by 15:\nT = 84\n\nTherefore, the value of $T$ is $\\boxed{84}$.",
