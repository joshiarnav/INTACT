We first identify these small triangles as the basic unit of the figure.\n\n## Step 2: Count the small triangles\nBy visually inspecting the figure, we can count the number of small triangles. There are 11 small triangles that are not part of any larger triangle.\n\n## Step 3: Identify larger triangles\nIn addition to the small triangles, we notice that there are larger triangles formed by combining smaller triangles. Specifically, there are triangles formed by 4 small triangles.\n\n## Step 4: Count the larger triangles\nWe count the number of larger triangles formed by 4 small triangles. There are 4 such triangles in the figure.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the largest triangle\nThere is also one large triangle that encompasses 9 small triangles.\n\n## Step 6: Count the total number of triangles\nTo find the total number of triangles, we sum the counts from each step: 11 small triangles + 4 larger triangles + 1 largest triangle.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11+4+1=16}$",
