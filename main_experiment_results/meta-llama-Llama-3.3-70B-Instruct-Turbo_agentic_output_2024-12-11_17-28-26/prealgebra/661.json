    "solution": "First, let's calculate the area of the plot of land in cm. Then, we'll convert as the questions ask.\n\nRecall the formula for the area of a trapezoid is given by $\\mbox{Area} = (\\mbox{bottom} + \\mbox{ top})\\times \\mbox{height} \\times \\frac{1}{2}$, so the area of this trapezoid is $$(10 \\mbox{cm} + 15 \\mbox{cm}) \\times 10 \\mbox{cm} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 125 \\mbox{cm}^2.$$Now, we are given that $1 \\mbox{ cm } = 2 \\mbox{ miles }$. Squaring both sides, that means $$1 \\mbox{ cm}^2 = 4 \\mbox{ miles}^2.$$We are told that $1 \\mbox{ miles}^2 = 640 \\mbox{ acres}$, so the above equation is actually:\n\n$$1 \\mbox{ cm}^2 = 4 \\mbox{ miles}^2 \\times \\frac{ 640 \\mbox{ acres}}{1 \\mbox{ miles}^2} = 2560 \\mbox{ acres}.$$Finally, we can convert $$125 \\mbox{ cm}^2 \\times \\frac{ 2560 \\mbox{ acres}}{1 \\mbox{ cm}^2} = \\boxed{320000 \\mbox{ acres}}.$$",
