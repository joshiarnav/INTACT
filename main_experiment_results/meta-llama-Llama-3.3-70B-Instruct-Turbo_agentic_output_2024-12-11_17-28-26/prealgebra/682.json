    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "When we write $\\frac{5}{33}$ as a decimal using long division, we get $0.\\overline{15}=0.15151515\\ldots$. Notice the pattern we have here: if $n$ is odd, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal point is $1$; if $n$ is even, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal place is $5$. Since $92$ is an even number, the digit at the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point is $\\boxed{5}.$",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, the first step is to convert the given fraction $\\frac{5}{33}$ into a decimal. We can do this by dividing the numerator (5) by the denominator (33) using long division. \n\nPerforming the long division: 5 \u00f7 33 = 0.1515... \n\nWe observe that the decimal form of $\\frac{5}{33}$ is a repeating decimal, with the repeating pattern being \"15\".\nTo find the digit in the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point, we can use the fact that the decimal form of $\\frac{5}{33}$ has a repeating pattern of \"15\". Since the pattern has a length of 2 digits, we can divide 92 by 2 to see how many times the pattern repeats fully.\n\n92 \u00f7 2 = 46\n\nThis means that the pattern \"15\" repeats 46 times, which accounts for the first 92 digits. However, since 92 is an even number, the last digit of the 46th repetition will be the 92nd digit.\n\nThe pattern \"15\" is 2 digits long, and it ends with the digit \"5\". Since the pattern repeats an even number of times (46 times) to reach the 92nd digit, and \"15\" is an even-length pattern, the 92nd digit will be the last digit of the pattern, which is \"5\".\n\nTherefore, the digit in the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point is $\\boxed{5}$.",
