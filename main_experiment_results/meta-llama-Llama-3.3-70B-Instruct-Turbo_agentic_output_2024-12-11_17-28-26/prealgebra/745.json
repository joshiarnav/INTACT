    "problem": "How many diagonals does a convex polygon with 23 sides have?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If the polygon has 23 sides, then it has 23 vertices. A diagonal is created by choosing 2 non-adjacent vertices and connecting them. First we choose a vertex. There are 23 choices. Then we choose another vertex that is not adjacent to the one we already chose. There are 20 choices for this. However, we have double counted all the diagonals, so the number of diagonals is $\\frac{23 \\cdot 20}{2}=23 \\cdot 10=\\boxed{230} \\text{ diagonals}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To find the number of diagonals in a convex polygon, we can use a formula. The first step is to understand the formula, which is:\n\nNumber of diagonals = n(n-3)/2\n\nwhere n is the number of sides of the polygon. \n\nIn this case, n = 23.\nTo find the number of diagonals in the convex polygon with 23 sides, we will substitute n = 23 into the formula:\n\nNumber of diagonals = n(n-3)/2\n= 23(23-3)/2\n= 23(20)/2\n= 460/2\n= 230\n\nSo, the convex polygon with 23 sides has 230 diagonals.\n\n$\\boxed{230}$",
