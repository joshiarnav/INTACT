    "problem": "If $x$ is a positive multiple of 8 and $x^2>100$, but $x<20$, what is $x$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "This question gives multiple clues on what $x$ could be. Because $x^2>100$, we know that $x$ must be greater than 10, but $x$ is also less than 20. So $x$ is a multiple of 8 that is between 10 and 20. The only value that fits this description is $\\boxed{16}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To find the value of $x$, we'll start by analyzing the given conditions. The first condition states that $x$ is a positive multiple of 8. This means $x$ can be expressed as $8n$, where $n$ is a positive integer. \n\nSo, the possible values of $x$ are 8, 16, 24, 32, and so on. We'll use this information to narrow down the options in the next step.\nThe next condition to consider is $x^2 > 100$. To find the values of $x$ that satisfy this condition, we need to find the square root of 100, which is 10. This means $x$ must be greater than 10, since $x$ is positive.\n\nSo, from the possible values of $x$ (8, 16, 24, 32, ...), we can eliminate 8 because $8^2 = 64$, which is less than 100 is not true, but 8 is less than 10 and any value less than 10 will have a square less than 100 when considering positive multiples of 8, so 8 is eliminated.\n\nThe remaining possible values are 16, 24, 32, and so on.\n\nThe last condition states that $x < 20$. From the remaining possible values (16, 24, 32, ...), we can see that only one value satisfies this condition.\n\nThe value of $x$ that satisfies all the given conditions is $\\boxed{16}$.",
