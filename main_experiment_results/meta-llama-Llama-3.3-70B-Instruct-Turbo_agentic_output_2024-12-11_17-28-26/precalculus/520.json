In spherical coordinates, a point in space is represented by three quantities: \\(\\rho\\), \\(\\theta\\), and \\(\\phi\\).

The correct answer choice corresponding to a sphere is (D).\nThe final step is to confirm that the description matches the characteristics of the shape indicated by the answer choice. Since a sphere is defined as the set of all points in space that are a fixed distance (the radius) away from a given center point (the origin in this case), and the equation \\(\\rho = c\\) specifies that every point described by the equation is at a constant distance \\(c\\) from the origin, the equation indeed describes a sphere.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{(D)}$.",
