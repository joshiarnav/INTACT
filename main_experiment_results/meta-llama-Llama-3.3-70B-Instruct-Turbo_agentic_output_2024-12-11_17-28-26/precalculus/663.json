    "model_solution": "The first step is to recall the standard period of the cosine function, which is $2\\pi$. The standard period is the distance along the x-axis over which the function repeats itself. For the function $y = \\cos x$, the period is $2\\pi$. However, in the given function $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, the angle inside the cosine function is $\\frac{x}{2}$, not $x$. This indicates that the function is being horizontally stretched or compressed, which affects its period.\nTo find the period of $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, we need to determine how the coefficient of $\\frac{1}{2}$ inside the cosine function affects the period. The general formula for the period of $y = \\cos bx$ is $\\frac{2\\pi}{|b|}$. In our case, $b = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nUsing the formula, we substitute $b = \\frac{1}{2}$ into $\\frac{2\\pi}{|b|}$ to find the period of $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$. Thus, the period is $\\frac{2\\pi}{|\\frac{1}{2}|} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\\pi \\times 2 = 4\\pi$.\n\nTherefore, the period of $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$ is $\\boxed{4\\pi}$.",
