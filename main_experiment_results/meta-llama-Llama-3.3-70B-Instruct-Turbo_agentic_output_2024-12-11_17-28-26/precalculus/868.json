    "solution": "Two angles have the same tangent if and only if they differ by a multiple of $\\pi.$  This means $\\tan x - x$ is a multiple of $\\pi.$  Let\n\\[T(x) = \\tan x - x.\\]First, we prove that the function $T(x)$ is strictly increasing on the interval $\\left[ 0, \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right).$  Let $0 \\le x < y < \\frac{\\pi}{2}.$  Then\n\\[y - x < \\tan (y - x) = \\frac{\\tan y - \\tan x}{1 + \\tan x \\tan y} \\le \\tan y - \\tan x.\\]Re-arranging, we get $\\tan x - x < \\tan y - y,$ or $T(x) < T(y).$\n\nNote that as $x$ approaches $\\frac{\\pi}{2},$ $T(x)$ approaches infinity.  This means for every nonnegative integer $n,$ there exists a unique value of $x$ such that $T(x) = n \\pi.$\n\nWe have the estimate $300 \\pi \\approx 942.48.$  Hence,\n\\[T(\\tan^{-1} 942) = 942 - \\tan^{-1} 942 < 942 < 300 \\pi.\\]Also,\n\\[T(\\tan^{-1} 924) = 942 - \\tan^{-1} 942 > 942 - \\frac{\\pi}{2} > 299 \\pi.\\]Since $299 \\pi < T(\\tan^{-1} 942) < 300 \\pi,$ the equation $T(x) = n \\pi$ has a solution on the interval $[0, \\tan^{-1} 942]$ if and only if $0 \\le n < 300,$ so there are $\\boxed{300}$ solutions.",

To find the solutions on the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$, we need to consider the properties of the tangent function and its inverse.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the tangent function\nThe tangent function is periodic with period $\\pi$, meaning it repeats every $\\pi$ units. The equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ will be satisfied when $x$ and $\\tan x$ differ by an integer multiple of $\\pi$, because the tangent function has the same value at $x$ and $x + k\\pi$ for any integer $k$.\n\n## Step 3: Using the given inequality\nGiven that $\\tan \\theta > \\theta$ for $0 < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we can infer that as $x$ increases from $0$ to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $\\tan x$ increases faster than $x$.
