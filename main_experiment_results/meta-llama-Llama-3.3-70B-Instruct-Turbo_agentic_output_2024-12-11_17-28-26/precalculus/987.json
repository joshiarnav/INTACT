This means it increases linearly but very slowly.\n- The function \\(g(x) = \\sin x\\) is a periodic trigonometric function that oscillates between -1 and 1.

Specifically, within this first period, \\(f(x)\\) intersects \\(g(x)\\) twice: once as \\(g(x)\\) increases from 0 to 1 and once as \\(g(x)\\) decreases from 1 to 0, due to the symmetry of the sine function about \\(\\pi/2\\) within its period.\n\nHowever, considering the entire real number line, we must account for the periodic nature of \\(g(x)\\) and the linear, yet slow, increase of \\(f(x)\\).
