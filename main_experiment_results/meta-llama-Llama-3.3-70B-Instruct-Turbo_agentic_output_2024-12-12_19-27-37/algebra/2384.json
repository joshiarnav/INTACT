    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "From the information given, we have $x^2 = 2x + 48$. Rearranging, we get $x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$, which we can factor as $(x+6)(x-8) = 0$. Therefore, $x = -6\\text{ or }8$.  Since we want the lesser, $\\boxed{-6}$ is our answer.",

    "model_solution": "Let's denote the integer as 'x'. We need to set up the equation according to the given problem. The equation will be: \n\nx^2 = 2x + 48\nTo solve for 'x', we need to rearrange the equation into a standard quadratic equation format by moving all terms to one side of the equation. This gives us:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 48 = 0\n\nThis is the next step in solving the given problem.\nTo solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 1, b = -2, and c = -48. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:\n\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a((-2)^2 - 4*1*(-48))) / 2*1\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a(4 + 192)) / 2\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a196) / 2\nx = (2 \u00b1 14) / 2\n\nThis gives us two possible values for x: \n\nx = (2 + 14) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8\nx = (2 - 14) / 2 = -12 / 2 = -6\n\nSince we are looking for the least integer, we consider both solutions.\nTo determine the least integer, we compare the two possible values for x: 8 and -6. Since -6 is less than 8, the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double is -6.\n\n$\\boxed{-6}$",
