    "problem": "The third and fourth terms of a geometric sequence are 12 and 16, respectively. What is the first term of the sequence?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence. Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$. Solving, we have $a\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To find the first term of the geometric sequence, let's denote the first term as 'a' and the common ratio as 'r'. Since it's a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 'r'. Given that the third term is 12 and the fourth term is 16, we can set up the equation: ar^2 = 12 and ar^3 = 16.\nTo find the common ratio 'r', we can divide the equation for the fourth term by the equation for the third term: $\\frac{ar^3}{ar^2} = \\frac{16}{12}$. This simplifies to $r = \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\nNow that we have found the common ratio 'r' to be $\\frac{4}{3}$, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to solve for the first term 'a'. Using the equation $ar^2 = 12$ and substituting $r = \\frac{4}{3}$, we get $a(\\frac{4}{3})^2 = 12$. This simplifies to $a(\\frac{16}{9}) = 12$. Solving for 'a', we have $a = \\frac{12 \\times 9}{16}$. \n\nThis gives $a = \\frac{108}{16}$, which further simplifies to $a = \\frac{27}{4}$.\nThe value of $a = \\frac{27}{4}$ is the solution to the problem, so the next step is to present it as the final answer. $\\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$",
