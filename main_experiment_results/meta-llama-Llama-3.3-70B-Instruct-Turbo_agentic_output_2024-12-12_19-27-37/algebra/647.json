    "solution": "We will complete the square on the given quadratic expression to find the vertex. Factoring $-3$ from the first two terms, we have \\[y=-3(x^2+10x)-81\\]In order to make the expression inside the parentheses a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(10/2)^2=25$ inside the parentheses. Doing this, we get \\[y=-3(x^2+10x+25-25)-81 = -3(x+5)^2-6\\]The graph of an equation of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ is a parabola with vertex at $(h,k)$, so the vertex of our parabola is at $(-5,-6)$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{-6}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the vertex of the parabola, we need to rewrite the given equation in vertex form, $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex. The first step is to complete the square on the quadratic term. \n\nWe start with the given equation: $y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81$. Factor out the coefficient of $x^2$, which is -3: $y = -3(x^2 + 10x) - 81$.\nTo complete the square for the quadratic term $x^2 + 10x$, we take the coefficient of $x$, which is $10$, divide it by $2$, giving us $5$, and then square it, resulting in $25$. We then add and subtract $25$ inside the parenthesis: $y = -3(x^2 + 10x + 25 - 25) - 81$. \n\nThis can be rewritten as: $y = -3((x^2 + 10x + 25) - 25) - 81$. \n\nSimplifying further: $y = -3(x + 5)^2 + 75 - 81$. \n\nCombining the constants: $y = -3(x + 5)^2 - 6$. \n\nNow the equation is in vertex form, $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex. From this, we can identify that $h = -5$ and $k = -6$. Since the vertex is $(m,n)$ and we found $k$ to be $-6$, $n = -6$.\nThe next step is to confirm that we have found the value of $n$, which is the $y$-coordinate of the vertex. Since we've already determined that $n = -6$ from the vertex form of the equation, we can conclude that we have found the solution to the problem. \n\n$\\boxed{-6}$",
