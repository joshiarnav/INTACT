We also need to consider the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle, where the side lengths follow a specific ratio.\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the side lengths are in the ratio $1 : \\sqrt{3} : 2$, where the side opposite the $30^\\circ$ angle is $1$, the side opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle is $\\sqrt{3}$, and the hypotenuse is $2$. Using this ratio, we can determine that the sine of $60^\\circ$ is equal to the ratio of the side opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle to the hypotenuse, which is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nThe next step is to confirm that the ratio $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is indeed the value of $\\sin 60^\\circ$ by ensuring it matches the definition of sine in a right-angled triangle and the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle.
