    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to use the Triangle Inequality Theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.

From the inequalities, we have:\nx < 11\nx > 1\nSince x is an integer, the possible values of x are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. \n\nWe need to find the largest possible value of x to maximize the perimeter.\nThe next step is to find the largest possible value of x from the given range of possible values, which is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The largest value of x is 10. Now, we can calculate the largest possible perimeter of the triangle by adding the lengths of all three sides: 5 + 6 + 10 = 21.\nThe largest possible perimeter of the triangle is 5 + 6 + 10 = 21. \n\n$\\boxed{21}$",
