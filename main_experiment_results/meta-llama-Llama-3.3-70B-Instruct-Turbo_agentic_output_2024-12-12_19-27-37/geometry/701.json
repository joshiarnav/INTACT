Thus, the side length of the octagon is $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWe can compute the octagon's area by subtracting the area of the four right isosceles triangles from the area of square $BDEF$.\n\nThe four right isosceles triangles are congruent by symmetry and each has an area of $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 1 \\cdot 1$, so their total area is \\[4\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 2.\\]  Each side of square $BDEF$ is comprised of a leg of a right isosceles triangle, a side of the octagon, and another leg of a different right isosceles triangle.  Hence, the side length of $BDEF$ is $1+\\sqrt{2}+1=2+\\sqrt{2}$, and the area of $BDEF$ is \\[(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4+2+4\\sqrt{2}.\\] Finally, the area of the octagon is \\[4+2+4\\sqrt{2} - 2 = \\boxed{4+4\\sqrt{2}}.\\]",
