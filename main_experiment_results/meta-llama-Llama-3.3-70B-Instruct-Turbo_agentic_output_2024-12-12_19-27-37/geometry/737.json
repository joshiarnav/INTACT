    "solution": "Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2.\\]  Solving for $r$ and keeping the positive value yields $r^2=81$, so $r = 9$.  Hence the volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=81\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\pi = \\boxed{972\\pi}.\\]",

Dividing both sides by $4\\pi$, we get $r^2 = 81$. Taking the square root of both sides, we obtain $r = 9$.\nNow that we have the radius $r = 9$, the next step is to recall the formula for the volume of a sphere: $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, and substitute $r = 9$ into this formula to find the volume.
