            "To solve $f_4(x) = x$, we set $\\frac{55x + 78}{13x + 42} = x$.\n\nMultiplying both sides by $13x + 42$ gives $55x + 78 = x(13x + 42)$.\n\nExpanding the right side yields $55x + 78 = 13x^2 + 42x$.\n\nRearranging this into a quadratic equation gives $13x^2 - 13x - 78 = 0$.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 13, resulting in $x^2 - x - 6 = 0$.\n\nNotice that this is the same quadratic equation we obtained when solving $f(x) = x$ and $f_2(x) = x$. Thus, the solutions are again $x = 3$ and $x = -2$.\n\nThis observation indicates that $f_4(x)$ does not introduce any new fixed points beyond those of $f(x)$ and $f_2(x)$, suggesting a pattern where the fixed points of $f_n(x)$ for any $n$ are $x = 3$ and $x",

            "To conclude the analysis, given that the fixed points of $f(x)$, $f_2(x)$, and $f_4(x)$ are the same, namely $x = 3$ and $x = -2$, and considering the nature of the function $f_n(x)$, it appears that these are the only values of $x$ for which $f_n(x) = x$ for any positive integer $n$. The pattern observed in $f_2(x)$, $f_3(x)$, and $f_4(x)$ suggests that applying $f$ repeatedly does not introduce new fixed points beyond $x = 3$ and $x = -2$.\n\nSince $f_n(x)$ for any $n$ does not seem to introduce new fixed points other than $x = 3$ and $x = -2$, and given that these values are the fixed points of the original function $f(x)$, we can deduce that the set $S$ of all real numbers $x$ such that $f_n(x) = x$ for some positive integer $n$ consists only of $x = 3$ and $x = -2$.\n\nTherefore, the number",
