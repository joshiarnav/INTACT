    "solution": "We can factor the equation as\n\\[x^6 (x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379) = 0.\\]Since we are looking for positive real solutions, this reduces to\n\\[x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379.\\]Consider the function $f(x) = x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379.$  This is increasing for $x > 0.$  Also, $f(0) < 0$ and $f(1) > 0,$ so there is exactly $\\boxed{1}$ positive real solution, which lies in the interval $(0,1).$",

The first factor, $x^6$, equals zero if and only if $x = 0$. However, since we are interested in positive real solutions, $x = 0$ is not a valid solution.

We need to determine the number of positive real roots of this polynomial equation. \n\nNext step: Apply Descartes' Rule of Signs to determine the possible number of positive real roots of the polynomial $x^4+7x^3+14x^2+1729x-1379=0$.\nTo apply Descartes' Rule of Signs, we examine the polynomial $x^4+7x^3+14x^2+1729x-1379=0$ and count the number of sign changes in the coefficients of the terms. The coefficients are 1, 7, 14, 1729, and -1379. There is only one sign change, from positive to negative, between 1729 and -1379. According to Descartes' Rule of Signs, the number of positive real roots is either equal to the number of sign changes or less than the number of sign changes by a positive even integer. Since there is only one sign change, the polynomial has exactly one positive real root.\nSince we have determined that the polynomial $x^4+7x^3+14x^2+1729x-1379=0$ has exactly one positive real root using Descartes' Rule of Signs, and this is the only factor that could contribute positive real solutions to the original equation, we conclude that the original equation $x^{10}+7x^9+14x^8+1729x^7-1379x^6=0$ has exactly one positive real solution. \n\n$\\boxed{1}$",
