            "The next step is to confirm that the value of $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2 = 321$ is indeed the greatest possible value by ensuring that all possible combinations of $(a, b, c, d)$ have been considered and that no other combinations yield a larger value for $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$.\n\nGiven that we have exhaustively examined the combinations arising from the factored form of $p(x)$ and considered the symmetry of the system, it is reasonable to conclude that $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2 = 321$ is the greatest possible value.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$ is $\\boxed{321}$.",
