    "solution": "We let our integer be $n$.  the first sentence tells us that  \\[n\\equiv 7\\pmod {15}.\\] Since 3 and 5 are both factors of 15 we deduce \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv2\\pmod5.\n\\end{align*} Therefore the remainders in question are 1 and 2, and their sum is $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, the first step is to represent the given integer as 15k + 7, where k is an integer, since it leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 15.\nNow, we need to find the remainders when the integer 15k + 7 is divided by 3 and by 5. To do this, we can simplify the expression 15k + 7 in terms of multiples of 3 and 5. \n\nWhen divided by 3, the term 15k is a multiple of 3 (since 15 is divisible by 3), so it will leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 3. The remainder when 15k + 7 is divided by 3 will be the same as the remainder when 7 is divided by 3. \n\nWhen divided by 5, the term 15k is a multiple of 5 (since 15 is divisible by 5), so it will leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 5. The remainder when 15k + 7 is divided by 5 will be the same as the remainder when 7 is divided by 5.\n\nNext, we calculate the remainders of 7 when divided by 3 and by 5. The remainder when 7 is divided by 3 is 1, and the remainder when 7 is divided by 5 is 2.\nTo find the sum of the remainders, we add the remainder when the integer is divided by 3 to the remainder when the integer is divided by 5. The remainder when divided by 3 is 1, and the remainder when divided by 5 is 2. So, the sum of the remainders is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n$\\boxed{3}$",
