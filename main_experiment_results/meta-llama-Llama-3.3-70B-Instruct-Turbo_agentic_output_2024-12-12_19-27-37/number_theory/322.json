    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, the first step is to identify the possible range of numbers that we need to consider. Since we are looking for the largest three-digit integer, we will start from 999 and work our way down. We also need to ensure that the number is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, which means the digits must be factors of the number.\nTo proceed with solving the problem, the next step is to analyze the hundreds digit of the desired number. Since we are looking for the largest three-digit integer, we start by considering 9 as the hundreds digit.\n\nReasoning: If the hundreds digit is 9, then the number is divisible by 9, which means the sum of its digits must also be divisible by 9. This information will help narrow down the possible combinations of digits for the tens and units places.\nThe next step is to find the possible combinations of tens and units digits that, when added to 9, result in a sum that is divisible by 9, and also ensure that the entire three-digit number is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits. We will start by listing the possible sums of the tens and units digits that are divisible by 9 when added to 9. Since 9 + 0 + 0 = 9, 9 + 1 + 8 = 18, 9 + 2 + 7 = 18, 9 + 3 + 6 = 18, 9 + 4 + 5 = 18, and so on, we can consider combinations such as (0, 0), (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), and their permutations, while ensuring the digits are distinct and non-zero. However, we must also verify that the resulting three-digit numbers are divisible by each of their distinct, non-zero digits. \n\nFor example, for the combination (1, 8), the number 918 must be divisible by 1, 8, and 9.\nTo proceed, we need to examine each possible combination of tens and units digits that result in a sum divisible by 9 when added to 9, and verify that the resulting three-digit numbers are divisible by each of their distinct, non-zero digits. \n\nStarting with the combinations (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), and (4, 5), and their permutations, we can check the divisibility of the resulting numbers. For instance, 918 must be divisible by 1, 8, and 9. Since 918 is divisible by 1 and 9, but 918 \u00f7 8 = 114.75, which is not an integer, 918 does not meet the criteria.\n\nNext, we will check the number 927. Since 927 is divisible by 1, 7, and 9, but 927 \u00f7 2 is not an integer (although 2 is not a factor in this case, we were considering the permutation), we need to consider numbers like 936, 945, 972, 981, and 998, ensuring each number is divisible by its distinct, non-zero digits. \n\nChecking 936: It's\nTo proceed with solving the problem, the next step is to examine each possible combination of tens and units digits that result in a sum divisible by 9 when added to 9, and verify that the resulting three-digit numbers are divisible by each of their distinct, non-zero digits.\n\nLet's start checking the numbers:\n- 918: Not divisible by 8.\n- 927: Not a valid permutation to check since we considered (2, 7) and not (1, 9, 2, 7) but rather the number 927 with digits (9, 2, 7).\n- 936: It's divisible by 9 and 6, but 936 \u00f7 3 = 312, which is an integer. However, we need to ensure it meets the criteria of being divisible by each distinct, non-zero digit.\n- 945: It's divisible by 9, but 945 \u00f7 5 = 189, and 945 \u00f7 4 is not an integer, but we are checking divisibility by 5 and 9. Since 4 is not a factor in this case, we see that 945 is divisible by 5 and 9.\n- 972:\nTo proceed with solving the problem, the next step is to continue checking the numbers:\n- 918: Not divisible by 8.\n- 927: Not a valid permutation to check since we considered (2, 7) and not (1, 9, 2, 7) but rather the number 927 with digits (9, 2, 7).\n- 936: It's divisible by 9, 3, and 6.\n- 945: It's divisible by 9 and 5.\n- 972: It's divisible by 9, but 972 \u00f7 7 = 139.142... and 972 \u00f7 2 = 486, which means 972 is divisible by 2 and 9, but not by 7.\n- 981: It's divisible by 9, but 981 \u00f7 8 = 122.625, and 981 \u00f7 1 = 981, which means 981 is divisible by 1 and 9, but not by 8.\n- 998: Not a valid option since the digits must be distinct and non-zero, but if we were to consider it, 998 \u00f7 9 =\nThe next step is to continue checking the numbers and find the largest three-digit integer that meets the criteria. \nFrom the previous checks:\n- 918: Not divisible by 8.\n- 927: Not a valid permutation to check since we considered (2, 7) and not (1, 9, 2, 7) but rather the number 927 with digits (9, 2, 7).\n- 936: It's divisible by 9, 3, and 6.\n- 945: It's divisible by 9 and 5.\n- 972: It's divisible by 9 and 2, but not by 7.\n- 981: It's divisible by 9 and 1, but not by 8.\n- 998: Not a valid option since the digits must be distinct and non-zero.\n\nWe found that 936 is divisible by 9, 3, and 6, meeting the criteria. Now we need to check other possible combinations to ensure we have the largest three-digit number that meets the criteria. \n\nSince we are looking for the largest three-digit integer and have found a potential candidate in 936, the next step is to verify if there\nTo verify if there are any larger three-digit integers that meet the criteria, the next step is to consider hundreds digits less than 9 and repeat the process of finding combinations of tens and units digits that result in a sum divisible by the hundreds digit, and ensure the entire three-digit number is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits. \n\nConsidering the next largest hundreds digit, which is 8, we need to find combinations of tens and units digits such that their sum is divisible by 8, and the resulting three-digit number is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.
