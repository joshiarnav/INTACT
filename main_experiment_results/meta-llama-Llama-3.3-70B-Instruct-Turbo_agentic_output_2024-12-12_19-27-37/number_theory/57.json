    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 10\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 12\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 10+4+12 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $24$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "To start solving this problem, we can represent the three integers based on the given remainders when they are divided by 24. Let's denote the three integers as $a$, $b$, and $c$. Given the remainders, we can express $a$, $b$, and $c$ as follows:\n\n$a = 24n + 10$\n$b = 24m + 4$\n$c = 24p + 12$\n\nwhere $n$, $m$, and $p$ are non-negative integers.\nTo find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24, we need to add the expressions for $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n\n$a + b + c = (24n + 10) + (24m + 4) + (24p + 12)$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$a + b + c = 24n + 24m + 24p + 10 + 4 + 12$\n\nSimplify further:\n\n$a + b + c = 24(n + m + p) + 26$\n\nSince $24(n + m + p)$ is divisible by 24, we can rewrite $26$ as $24 + 2$ to make it clear what the remainder is when the sum is divided by 24:\n\n$a + b + c = 24(n + m + p) + 24 + 2$\n\n$a + b + c = 24(n + m + p + 1) + 2$\n\nNow it's clear that when $a + b + c$ is divided by 24, the remainder is 2.\nThe next step is to confirm that the remainder is indeed 2 when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24. This can be done by realizing that the $24(n + m + p + 1)$ term is a multiple of 24 and thus does not contribute to the remainder, leaving only the constant term 2 as the remainder.\n\nTherefore, the final step is to state the solution as $\\boxed{2}$.",
