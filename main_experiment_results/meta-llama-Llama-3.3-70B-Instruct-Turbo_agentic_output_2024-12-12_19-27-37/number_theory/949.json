    "solution": "Subtract 1 from both sides to obtain $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$. Add 12 to the right-hand side to get $8x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{12}$. Now divide both sides by 8, remembering to divide 12 by the greatest common factor of 12 and 8, thus obtaining $x \\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. This gives $a+m = 2 + 3 = \\boxed{5}$. Here we have used the fact that $ad \\equiv bd\\pmod{m}$ if and only if $a\\equiv b \\pmod{m/\\text{gcd}(m,d)}$, for integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a$, $b$, and $d$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve the given congruence $8x+1\\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$, the first step is to subtract 1 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with $x$. This gives $8x \\equiv 5 - 1 \\pmod{12}$, which simplifies to $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$.\nThe next step is to simplify the equation further by dividing both sides of the congruence by the greatest common divisor of $8$ and $12$, which is $4$. This yields $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, since dividing the modulus $12$ by $4$ results in $3$.\nTo solve $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, we need to find the modular inverse of $2$ modulo $3$. Since $2 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, the modular inverse of $2$ is $2$ itself. Thus, multiplying both sides of the congruence by $2$ gives $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. \n\nNow, we have $a = 2$ and $m = 3$, so $a + m = 2 + 3 = 5$.\nThe next step is to calculate the final answer by adding $a$ and $m$. $a + m = 2 + 3 = 5$.
