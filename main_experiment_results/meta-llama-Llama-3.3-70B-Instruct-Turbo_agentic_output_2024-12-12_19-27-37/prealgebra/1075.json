    "problem": "There is a committee composed of eight women and two men. When they meet, they sit in a row---the women in indistinguishable rocking chairs and the men on indistinguishable stools.  How many distinct ways are there for me to arrange the eight chairs and two stools for a meeting?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Because the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from each other and the stools are indistinguishable from each other, we can think of first placing the two stools somewhere in the ten slots and then filling the rest with rocking chairs. The first stool has $10$ slots in which it can go, and the second has $9$. However, because they are indistinguishable from each other, we have overcounted the number of ways to place the stools by a factor of $2$, so we divide by $2$. Thus, there are $\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = \\boxed{45}$ distinct ways to arrange the ten chairs and stools for a meeting.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To find the number of distinct ways to arrange the ten seats, we can start by considering the total number of positions available for the seats. Since there are ten seats in total (eight rocking chairs and two stools), we have ten positions to fill. We will use the concept of combinations to solve this problem, as the order of the identical chairs or stools does not matter. \n\nThe first step is to recognize that this is a combination problem where we need to choose the positions for the two stools (or equivalently, the eight rocking chairs) out of the ten total positions. The formula for combinations, which represents the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items without regard to the order, is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!]\n\nIn this case, we want to find the number of ways to choose 2 positions for the stools out of 10 total positions.\nTo find the number of distinct ways to arrange the seats, we will apply the combination formula with n = 10 (total positions) and k = 2 (positions for the stools). Plugging these values into the combination formula gives us:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / [2!(10-2)!]\n\nSimplifying this expression will give us the total number of distinct arrangements. \n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / [2!8!] \n\n= (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)\n\n= 45\n\nTherefore, the next step is to simplify and calculate the value of C(10, 2), which equals 45. Since this is the final calculation, the solution to the problem is $\\boxed{45}$.",
