    "problem": "Chloe wants to buy a hoodie that costs $\\$32.75$. She empties her wallet and finds she only has three $\\$10$ bills, eight quarters, and a pile of dimes. What is the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $n$ represent the unknown number of dimes. Chloe's total amount of money is $$3(\\$10)+8(\\$.25)+n(\\$.10) \\ge \\$32.75.$$Simplifying gives  \\begin{align*}\n30+2+.10n &\\ge 32.75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\n.10n &\\ge .75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge \\frac{.75}{.10} \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge 7.5.\n\\end{align*}Chloe must have at least $\\boxed{8}$ dimes in her pile.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To find the minimum number of dimes Chloe needs, first, we should calculate the total amount of money she has from the three $10 bills and the eight quarters. Three $10 bills amount to $30, and eight quarters amount to $2. So, the total amount from these is $30 + $2 = $32.\nTo determine the minimum number of dimes Chloe needs, we now need to find out how much more money she needs to buy the hoodie after using the $10 bills and the quarters. The hoodie costs $32.75, and she has $32 from the bills and quarters. So, we subtract the amount she has from the cost of the hoodie to find the remaining amount she needs: $32.75 - $32 = $0.75. Since each dime is worth $0.10, we will divide the remaining amount she needs by the value of a dime to find the minimum number of dimes required.\nTo find the minimum number of dimes Chloe needs, we divide the remaining amount she needs, $0.75, by the value of a dime, $0.10. This calculation is $\\frac{0.75}{0.10} = 7.5$. Since we cannot have a fraction of a coin, Chloe will need 8 dimes to have at least $0.75.\nSince we've already determined that Chloe needs 8 dimes to have at least $0.75, the next step is to confirm that this calculation provides the minimum number of dimes required for her to buy the hoodie. Therefore, the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie is $\\boxed{8}$.",
