    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7; the largest two-digit prime is 97 (98 and 99 are both composite).  The product of these three primes is $5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 97 = 35 \\cdot 97 = 35(100-3)=3500-105=\\boxed{3395}$.",

One-digit primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, and two-digit primes range from 11 to 97.\nTo find the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime, the next step is to identify the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime from the given list. The two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7, and the largest two-digit prime is 97.\nTo find the product, we need to multiply the two largest one-digit primes (5 and 7) and the largest two-digit prime (97). The next step is to calculate this product: $5 \\times 7 \\times 97$.\nTo find the product, we will multiply the numbers: $5 \\times 7 = 35$, then $35 \\times 97$. \n\nNext step: $35 \\times 97 = 3395$.\nThe product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime is $3395$.\nThe next step is to confirm that the calculation is correct and provide the product as the solution to the problem: $\\boxed{3395}$",
