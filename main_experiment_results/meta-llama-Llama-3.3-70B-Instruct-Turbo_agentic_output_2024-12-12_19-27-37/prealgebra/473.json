    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To round $18.4851$ to the nearest hundredth, we must look at the hundreds and the thousands digits of the number in question. Since the thousands digit ($5$) is greater than or equal to $5$, the hundreds digit $8$ rounds up to $9$. Therefore, $18.4851$ rounded to the nearest hundredth is equal to $\\boxed{18.49}$.",

The hundredth place is 8, so it will become 9. \n\nNext step: Change 18.4851 to 18.49.\nThe final step is to confirm that 18.49 is the result of rounding 18.4851 to the nearest hundredth. \n\n$\\boxed{18.49}$",
