    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since 91 is not divisible by the first three prime numbers, we try dividing $91\\div 7$.  We find a quotient of 13, so $91=7\\times 13$ and the sum of these prime factors is $7+13=\\boxed{20}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the prime factors of 91, the first step is to factorize 91 into its prime factors. We start by finding the smallest prime number that can divide 91, which is 7, since 91 \u00f7 7 = 13. Both 7 and 13 are prime numbers. So, the prime factorization of 91 is 7 * 13.\nThe next step is to find the sum of these prime factors, which is 7 + 13 = 20.\nThe final step is to confirm that the sum of the prime factors is indeed the solution to the problem, so the sum of the prime factors of 91 is $\\boxed{20}$.",
