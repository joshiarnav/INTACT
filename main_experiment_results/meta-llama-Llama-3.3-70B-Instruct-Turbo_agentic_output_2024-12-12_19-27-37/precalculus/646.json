The dot product of two vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix}$ is given by $ac + bd$. Applying this to the given vectors, we get the equation $2x + 5(-3) = 0$.\nTo solve for $x$, we simplify the equation $2x + 5(-3) = 0$ by first performing the multiplication, which gives $2x - 15 = 0$. Then, we isolate $x$ by adding $15$ to both sides of the equation, resulting in $2x = 15$.
