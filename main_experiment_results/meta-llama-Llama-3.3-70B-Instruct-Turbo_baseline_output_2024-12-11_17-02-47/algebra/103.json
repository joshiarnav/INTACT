    "solution": "We only need to worry about the terms that multiply to have a degree of $2$. This would be given by the product of the terms $3x^2$ and $-4$ as well as the product of the terms $-2x$ and $-7x$. Thus, $$(3x^2) \\times (-4) + (-2x) \\times (-7x) = -12x^2 + 14x^2 = 2x^2,$$and the coefficient is $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the possible combinations that result in an $x^2$ term\nTo find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion of the given product, we need to consider all possible combinations of terms from the two polynomials that multiply to give $x^2$. These combinations are $x^2 \\cdot 1$, $x \\cdot x$, and $1 \\cdot x^2$. However, since the first polynomial does not have a constant term, we only consider $x^2 \\cdot 1$ and $x \\cdot x$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the terms in each polynomial that can contribute to $x^2$\nFrom the first polynomial, $ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x$, the terms that can contribute to $x^2$ are $3x^2$ and $-2x$. From the second polynomial, $bx^2 - 7x - 4$, the terms that can contribute are $-4$ (when multiplied by $x^2$ from the first polynomial) and $-7x$ (when multiplied by $-2x$ from the first polynomial).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the $x^2$ term from the $x^2 \\cdot 1$ combination\nThe term $3x^2$ from the first polynomial multiplied by $-4$ from the second polynomial gives $3x^2 \\cdot -4 = -12x^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the $x^2$ term from the $x \\cdot x$ combination\nThe term $-2x$ from the first polynomial multiplied by $-7x$ from the second polynomial gives $-2x \\cdot -7x = 14x^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Add the coefficients of the $x^2$ terms to find the total coefficient\nAdding the coefficients from the two relevant combinations: $-12 + 14 = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
