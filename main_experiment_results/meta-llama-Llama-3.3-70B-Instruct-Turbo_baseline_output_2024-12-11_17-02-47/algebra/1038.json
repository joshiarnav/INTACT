    "problem": "What is the greatest integer $n$ such that $n^2 - 11n +24 \\leq 0$?",
    "solution": "We can factor $n^2-11n+24$ as $(n-3)(n-8)$. For this quantity to be less than or equal to 0, one of the factors must be less than or equal to 0 and the other factor must be greater than or equal to 0. Specifically, since $n-8<n-3$ for all $n$, we must have $$n-8 \\le 0 \\le n-3.$$ The first inequality, $n-8\\le 0$, tells us that $n\\le 8$. The second inequality, $0\\le n-3$, tells us that $n\\ge 3$. The solutions to the original inequality must satisfy both conditions, so they are given by $3\\le n\\le 8$. The largest integer in this interval is $n=\\boxed{8}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given inequality\nThe given inequality is $n^2 - 11n +24 \\leq 0$. This is a quadratic inequality, which can be factored or solved using the quadratic formula to find the roots.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the quadratic expression\nThe quadratic expression $n^2 - 11n +24$ can be factored as $(n-8)(n-3)$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the inequality with the factored expression\nSubstituting the factored form into the inequality gives $(n-8)(n-3) \\leq 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the critical points\nThe critical points occur where $(n-8)(n-3) = 0$. This gives $n = 8$ or $n = 3$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the intervals of inequality\nTo solve the inequality, we examine the sign of the expression $(n-8)(n-3)$ in the intervals defined by the critical points: $(-\\infty, 3)$, $(3, 8)$, and $(8, \\infty)$.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the interval $(-\\infty, 3)$\nFor $n < 3$, both $(n-8)$ and $(n-3)$ are negative, so their product is positive.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the interval $(3, 8)$\nFor $3 < n < 8$, $(n-8)$ is negative and $(n-3)$ is positive, so their product is negative.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the interval $(8, \\infty)$\nFor $n > 8$, both $(n-8)$ and $(n-3)$ are positive, so their product is positive.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the solution interval\nThe inequality $(n-8)(n-3) \\leq 0$ is satisfied when the product is negative or zero, which occurs in the interval $[3, 8]$.\n\n## Step 10: Identify the greatest integer $n$ in the solution interval\nThe greatest integer $n$ in the interval $[3, 8]$ is $8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
