    "solution": "There is a vertical asymptote where the denominator equals 0 and thus $y$ is undefined. For the denominator to equal 0, we have $5x-7=0\\Rightarrow x=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the condition for a vertical asymptote\nA vertical asymptote occurs in a rational function when the denominator equals zero, and the numerator does not.\n\n## Step 2: Set the denominator equal to zero\nFor the given function $y=\\frac{x+2}{5x-7}$, we set the denominator $5x-7$ equal to zero to find the x-value where the vertical asymptote occurs.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for x\nSolving $5x-7 = 0$ gives $5x = 7$, and thus $x = \\frac{7}{5}$.\n\n## Step 4: Check if the numerator is not zero at this x-value\nSubstitute $x = \\frac{7}{5}$ into the numerator $x+2$ to ensure it does not equal zero. Since $\\frac{7}{5} + 2 \\neq 0$, the condition for a vertical asymptote is met.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{5}}$"
