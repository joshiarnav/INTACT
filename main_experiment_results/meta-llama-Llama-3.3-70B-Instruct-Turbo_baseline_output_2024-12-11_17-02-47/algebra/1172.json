    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Evaluate the inner function g(x) at x=5\nFirst, we need to find the value of g(5) by substituting x=5 into the equation for g(x), which is g(x) = 2x - 1. So, g(5) = 2*5 - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the value of g(5) into the function f(x)\nNow that we know g(5) = 9, we substitute this value into the equation for f(x), which is f(x) = x^2 + 1. Therefore, f(g(5)) = f(9) = 9^2 + 1.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the value of f(g(5))\nCalculate the value of f(g(5)) by squaring 9 and then adding 1. So, 9^2 = 81, and 81 + 1 = 82.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{82}$"
