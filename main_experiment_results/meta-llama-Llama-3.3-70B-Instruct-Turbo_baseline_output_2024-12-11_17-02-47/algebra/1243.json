    "solution": "We know that by definition, $i^2=-1$, so $i^4=(-1)^2=1.$ More generally, for all integers k, $i^{4k}=(i^4)^k=1^k=1$. This means that $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}= i^8(i^3)+i^{16}(1)+i^{20}(i)+i^{24}(i^2)+i^{28}(i^3)=i^3+1+i+i^2+i^3$. Since $i^3=-i$, we can simplify this to get our final result: $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}=-i+1+i-1-i=\\boxed{-i}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the definition of the imaginary unit\nThe imaginary unit $i$ is defined as the square root of $-1$, denoted by $i = \\sqrt{-1}$. From this definition, it follows that $i^2 = -1$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the pattern of powers of $i$\nTo evaluate the given expression, we need to understand the pattern of powers of $i$. The powers of $i$ follow a cyclic pattern: $i^1 = i$, $i^2 = -1$, $i^3 = -i$, $i^4 = 1$, and then the cycle repeats every 4 powers.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate $i^{11}$\nTo evaluate $i^{11}$, we divide the exponent by 4 and look at the remainder. $11 \\div 4 = 2$ with a remainder of $3$. Since the remainder is $3$, $i^{11}$ is equivalent to $i^3$, which equals $-i$.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate $i^{16}$\nFor $i^{16}$, we divide the exponent by 4. $16 \\div 4 = 4$ with a remainder of $0$. Since the remainder is $0$, $i^{16}$ is equivalent to $i^0$ or $i^4$, which equals $1$.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate $i^{21}$\nTo evaluate $i^{21}$, we divide the exponent by 4. $21 \\div 4 = 5$ with a remainder of $1$. Since the remainder is $1$, $i^{21}$ is equivalent to $i^1$, which equals $i$.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate $i^{26}$\nFor $i^{26}$, we divide the exponent by 4. $26 \\div 4 = 6$ with a remainder of $2$. Since the remainder is $2$, $i^{26}$ is equivalent to $i^2$, which equals $-1$.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate $i^{31}$\nTo evaluate $i^{31}$, we divide the exponent by 4. $31 \\div 4 = 7$ with a remainder of $3$. Since the remainder is $3$, $i^{31}$ is equivalent to $i^3$, which equals $-i$.\n\n## Step 8: Sum the evaluated powers of $i$\nNow, we sum the results: $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31} = -i + 1 + i - 1 - i$.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying the expression, we notice that $-i + i = 0$ and $1 - 1 = 0$, so we are left with $-i$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{- i}$"
