    "problem": "Phoenix hiked the Rocky Path Trail last week. It took four days to complete the trip. The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles. The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day. The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles. The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles. How many miles long was the trail?",
    "solution": "Let the number of miles Phoenix hiked in each day be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=22\\\\\n(b+c)/2=13 \\Rightarrow b+c&=26\\\\\nc+d&=30\\\\\na+c&=26\n\\end{align*} Notice that we do not have to solve for any of the variables. We can add $a + b = 22$ to $c + d = 30$ and find that $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52.$ Therefore, the entire trail was $\\boxed{52}$ miles long.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the variables for each day's hike\nLet's denote the miles hiked on the first day as $a$, the second day as $b$, the third day as $c$, and the fourth day as $d$.\n\n## Step 2: Set up the equations based on the given information\nFrom the problem, we have the following equations:\n1. $a + b = 22$ (The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles)\n2. $(b + c)/2 = 13$ (The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day)\n3. $c + d = 30$ (The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles)\n4. $a + c = 26$ (The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles)\n\n## Step 3: Simplify equation 2 to make it easier to work with\nMultiply both sides of equation 2 by 2 to get rid of the fraction: $b + c = 26$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the system of equations\nWe can start by solving equations 1 and 4 to find the values of $a$ and $c$.\nFrom equation 1: $a = 22 - b$.\nFrom equation 4: $c = 26 - a$.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute $a$ from equation 1 into equation 4 to find a relationship between $b$ and $c$\nSubstituting $a = 22 - b$ into $a + c = 26$ gives $22 - b + c = 26$, which simplifies to $c - b = 4$.\n\n## Step 6: Use the relationship between $b$ and $c$ from step 5 and the simplified equation 2 to solve for $b$\nWe have $b + c = 26$ from step 3 and $c - b = 4$. Adding these two equations gives $2c = 30$, so $c = 15$.\nSubstituting $c = 15$ into $c - b = 4$ gives $15 - b = 4$, which simplifies to $b = 11$.\n\n## Step 7: Find $a$ using the value of $b$\nSubstitute $b = 11$ into $a + b = 22$ to get $a + 11 = 22$, which simplifies to $a = 11$.\n\n## Step 8: Find $d$ using the value of $c$\nSubstitute $c = 15$ into $c + d = 30$ to get $15 + d = 30$, which simplifies to $d = 15$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the total length of the trail\nThe total length of the trail is $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52$ miles.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{52}$"
