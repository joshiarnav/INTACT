    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the problem as a geometric series\nThe given expression is a geometric series, which is the sum of the terms of a geometric sequence. In this case, the first term $a_1 = \\frac{1}{3}$ and the common ratio $r = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of terms in the series\nThere are 6 terms in the given series.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series\nThe sum $S_n$ of the first $n$ terms of a geometric series can be found using the formula $S_n = \\frac{a_1(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}$, where $a_1$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute the given values into the formula\nSubstituting $a_1 = \\frac{1}{3}$, $r = \\frac{1}{3}$, and $n = 6$ into the formula gives $S_6 = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^6)}{1 - \\frac{1}{3}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying the expression, $S_6 = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^6)}{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^6)$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the value of $(\\frac{1}{3})^6$\n$(\\frac{1}{3})^6 = \\frac{1}{729}$.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute the value of $(\\frac{1}{3})^6$ into the expression\n$S_6 = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\frac{1}{729}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{728}{729}) = \\frac{364}{729}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{364}{729}}$"
