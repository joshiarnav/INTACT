    "solution": "First, we can factor out $1000=10^3$, so $\\sqrt[3]{2744000}=10\\sqrt[3]{2744}$.  To proceed, we can take out factors of two from 2744, to find that $2744=2\\cdot1372=2\\cdot2\\cdot686=2^3\\cdot343$.  With a little bit of guess and check, notice that $7^3=343$.  Therefore, $10\\sqrt[3]{2744}=10(14)=\\boxed{140}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Factor out 1000 from 2744000\nFirst, we notice that 2744000 has a factor of 1000, which is $10^3$. So, we can rewrite $\\sqrt[3]{2744000}$ as $\\sqrt[3]{1000 \\times 2744}$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the cube root of 1000\nSince $1000 = 10^3$, the cube root of 1000 is 10. So, we can simplify $\\sqrt[3]{1000 \\times 2744}$ as $10\\sqrt[3]{2744}$.\n\n## Step 3: Factor 2744\nNow, we need to factor 2744 to see if it has any perfect cube factors. Checking the factors of 2744, we find that $2744 = 14^3$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the cube root of 2744\nGiven that $2744 = 14^3$, the cube root of 2744 is 14. So, we can simplify $10\\sqrt[3]{2744}$ as $10 \\times 14$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the final value\nMultiplying 10 by 14 gives us 140.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{140}$"
