    "problem": "If $27^8=9^q$, what is $q$?",
    "solution": "We begin by expressing both sides of the equation in terms of the base 2: $(3^3)^8=(3^2)^q$, which simplifies to $3^{24}=3^{2q}$. Setting the exponents equal to each other, $24=2q$, or $q=\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Rewrite both sides of the equation with a common base\nWe can express $27$ as $3^3$ and $9$ as $3^2$. Thus, the equation becomes $(3^3)^8 = (3^2)^q$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the power of a power rule to both sides\nUsing the rule $(a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}$, we simplify the equation to $3^{3 \\cdot 8} = 3^{2 \\cdot q}$, which further simplifies to $3^{24} = 3^{2q}$.\n\n## Step 3: Set the exponents equal to each other\nSince the bases on both sides of the equation are equal, we can equate the exponents, giving us $24 = 2q$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $q$\nDividing both sides of the equation by $2$, we find $q = 12$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
