    "problem": "A box with a volume of 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold 50 paperclips. How many paperclips could a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ hold?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of paperclips that a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ could hold. Setting up the ratio $\\frac{50}{16}=\\frac{x}{48}$ and solving for $x$ gives $x=150$.  Hence, a 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ box could hold $\\boxed{150}$ paperclips.  We also could have noted that tripling the size of the box triples the number of paperclips we can hold, so the new box can hold $50\\cdot 3 = 150$ paperclips.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the ratio of the volumes of the two boxes.\nTo find out how many paperclips the larger box can hold, we first need to determine the ratio of the volumes of the two boxes. The volume of the smaller box is 16 $\\text{cm}^3$, and the volume of the larger box is 48 $\\text{cm}^3$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the volumes.\nThe ratio of the volumes is calculated by dividing the volume of the larger box by the volume of the smaller box: 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ / 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ = 3.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the ratio to the number of paperclips the smaller box can hold.\nSince the volume of the larger box is 3 times the volume of the smaller box, it can hold 3 times as many paperclips as the smaller box. The smaller box can hold 50 paperclips.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of paperclips the larger box can hold.\nTo find out how many paperclips the larger box can hold, we multiply the number of paperclips the smaller box can hold by the ratio of the volumes: 50 paperclips * 3 = 150 paperclips.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{150}$"
