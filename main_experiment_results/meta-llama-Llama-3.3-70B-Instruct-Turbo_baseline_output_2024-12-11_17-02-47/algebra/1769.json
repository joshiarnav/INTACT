    "problem": "What is the value of $\\displaystyle\\frac{235^2-221^2}{14}$?",
    "solution": "The key to this problem is noticing that $235^2 - 221^2$ factors into $(235+221)(235-221)$. So, our fraction becomes $\\frac{(235+221)(235-221)}{14} = \\frac{456 \\cdot 14}{14}$, which simplifies to $\\boxed{456}$.",
