    "problem": "Two parabolas are the graphs of the equations $y=2x^2-7x+1$ and $y=8x^2+5x+1$. Give all points where they intersect.  List the points in order of increasing $x$-coordinate, separated by semicolons.",
    "solution": "First, set the two equations equal to each other to get $2x^2-7x+1=8x^2+5x+1$. Combine like terms to get $6x^2+12x=0$. Then, we can divide by $6$ to get $x^2+2x=0$. To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{2}\\right)^2=1$ to both sides, giving $(x+1)^2=1$.\n\nSo we have $x+1=\\pm1$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x=-2$ or $0$. Using these in our original parabolas, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-2, 23)}$ and $\\boxed{(0, 1)}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the intersection points of the two parabolas, we need to set their equations equal to each other and solve for x.\nThe equation for the first parabola is $y=2x^2-7x+1$ and the equation for the second parabola is $y=8x^2+5x+1$. Setting them equal gives $2x^2-7x+1 = 8x^2+5x+1$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the equation by combining like terms.\nCombine like terms to get $0 = 6x^2 + 12x$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation for x.\nFactor out a $6x$ to get $0 = 6x(x + 2)$. This gives two solutions: $x = 0$ and $x = -2$.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute the x-values back into one of the original equations to find the corresponding y-values.\nFor $x = 0$, using the first equation $y=2x^2-7x+1$, we get $y = 2(0)^2 - 7(0) + 1 = 1$. For $x = -2$, we get $y = 2(-2)^2 - 7(-2) + 1 = 8 + 14 + 1 = 23$.\n\n## Step 5: Write down the intersection points in the required format.\nThe intersection points are $(0, 1)$ and $(-2, 23)$. In order of increasing $x$-coordinate, the points are $(-2, 23); (0, 1)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(-2, 23); (0, 1)}$"
