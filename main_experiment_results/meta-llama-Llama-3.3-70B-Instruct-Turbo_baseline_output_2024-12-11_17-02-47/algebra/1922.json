    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, we need to distribute the coefficients in front of each parenthesis to the terms inside.\nFor the first term, $3(x - 4)$, we distribute the $3$ to get $3x - 12$. For the second term, $4(7 - 2x^2 + 5x)$, we distribute the $4$ to get $28 - 8x^2 + 20x$. For the third term, $-8(2x - 1)$, we distribute the $-8$ to get $-16x + 8$.\n\n## Step 2: Now, we need to combine like terms.\nCombining all the terms we obtained from distributing, we have $3x - 12 + 28 - 8x^2 + 20x - 16x + 8$. Simplifying, $-8x^2$ has no like term to combine with, $3x + 20x - 16x$ combines to $7x$, and $-12 + 28 + 8$ combines to $24$. So, the simplified expression is $-8x^2 + 7x + 24$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the coefficient of $x$ in the simplified expression.\nThe term with $x$ is $7x$, meaning the coefficient of $x$ is $7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
