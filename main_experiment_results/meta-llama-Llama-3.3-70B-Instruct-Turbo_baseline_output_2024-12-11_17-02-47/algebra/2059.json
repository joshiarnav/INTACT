    "solution": "We can have $\\log_{10}10=1$ and $\\log_{10}100=2$.  Since $\\log_{10}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\\log_{10}10<\\log_{10}17<\\log_{10}100$, meaning $1<\\log_{10}17<2$.  Thus, the desired sum is $1+2=\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand what the problem is asking\nThe problem is asking for the sum of two consecutive integers $a$ and $b$ such that the value of $\\log_{10}{17}$ falls between these two integers.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the definition of a logarithm\nThe logarithm $\\log_{10}{x}$ gives the power to which 10 must be raised to produce the number $x$. In other words, if $\\log_{10}{x} = y$, then $10^y = x$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the range of $\\log_{10}{17}$\nWe know that $\\log_{10}{10} = 1$ and $\\log_{10}{100} = 2$ because $10^1 = 10$ and $10^2 = 100$. Since $17$ is between $10$ and $100$, $\\log_{10}{17}$ must be between $1$ and $2$.\n\n## Step 4: Identify $a$ and $b$\nGiven that $\\log_{10}{17}$ is between $1$ and $2$, we can conclude that $a = 1$ and $b = 2$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $a + b$\nTo find the sum of $a$ and $b$, we simply add them together: $a + b = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
