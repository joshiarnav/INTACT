    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the inverse of a function, we need to switch the roles of x and y and then solve for y.\nLet's start by writing the given function as $y = 4 - 5x$.\n\n## Step 2: Switch the roles of x and y.\nSwitching x and y gives us $x = 4 - 5y$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for y.\nNow, we need to solve this equation for y. First, we'll subtract 4 from both sides to get $x - 4 = -5y$.\n\n## Step 4: Divide both sides by -5 to solve for y.\nDividing both sides by -5 gives us $y = \\frac{4-x}{5}$.\n\n## Step 5: Write the inverse function.\nThe inverse function of $f(x)$ is denoted as $f^{-1}(x)$, so we have $f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{4-x}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4-x}{5}}$"
