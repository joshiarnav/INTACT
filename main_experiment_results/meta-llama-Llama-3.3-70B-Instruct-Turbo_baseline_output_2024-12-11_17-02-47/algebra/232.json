    "problem": "A 1$\\%$ late charge was added to Jenna's bill on the $30^{\\text{th}}$ day past its due date. The resulting total was then increased by 1$\\%$ because she did not pay the bill in the next 30 days either. Her original bill was $\\$400$. Exactly how much is the bill now?",
    "solution": "The first late charge brings the bill to $400 \\cdot 1.01 = 400 + 4 = 404$. The second late charge brings the bill to $404 \\cdot 1.01 = 404 + 4.04 = \\boxed{408.04}$ dollars.\n\n-OR-\n\nEach increase multiples the bill by $1+1\\%=1.01$. Therefore, her final bill is $\\$400(1.01)^2=\\$408.04$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, let's calculate the late charge that was added to Jenna's bill on the 30th day past its due date.\nThe late charge is 1% of her original bill, which was $400. So, the late charge is 0.01 * $400 = $4.\n\n## Step 2: Next, let's calculate the total bill after the late charge was added.\nThe total bill after the late charge is the original bill plus the late charge, which is $400 + $4 = $404.\n\n## Step 3: Then, let's calculate the increase in the total bill because Jenna did not pay the bill in the next 30 days.\nThe increase is 1% of the total bill after the late charge, which is 0.01 * $404 = $4.04.\n\n## Step 4: Finally, let's calculate the final total bill after the increase.\nThe final total bill is the total bill after the late charge plus the increase, which is $404 + $4.04 = $408.04.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{408.04}$"
