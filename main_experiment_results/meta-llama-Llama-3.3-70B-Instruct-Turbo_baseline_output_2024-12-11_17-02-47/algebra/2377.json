    "solution": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the solutions the the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$. We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively, so $p+q = m/10$ and $pq = 420/10 = 42$. Since $m = 10(p+q)$, we minimize $m$ by minimizing the sum $p+q$. Since $p$ and $q$ are integers and multiply to 42, the possible values of $(p,q)$ are $(1,42),(2,21),(3,14),(6,7),(7,6),(14,3),(21,2),(42,1)$. (Note that if $p$ and $q$ are both negative, then $p+q$ is negative, so $m$ would be negative, which is excluded by the problem.) The sum $p+q$ is minimized when $(p,q) = (6,7)$ or $(7,6)$. In either case, $m = 10(p+q) = 10(6+7) = \\boxed{130}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the nature of the solutions to a quadratic equation.\nTo find the smallest positive value of $m$ for which the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ has integral solutions, we need to recall the properties of quadratic equations and their roots. A quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ has roots given by the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. For the given equation, $a = 10$, $b = -m$, and $c = 420$. The roots will be integers if $\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$ is an integer.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula to the given equation.\nSubstitute $a = 10$, $b = -m$, and $c = 420$ into the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-(-m) \\pm \\sqrt{(-m)^2 - 4 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 420}}{2 \\cdot 10} = \\frac{m \\pm \\sqrt{m^2 - 16800}}{20}$. For $x$ to be an integer, $\\sqrt{m^2 - 16800}$ must be an integer.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the condition for integral solutions.\nThe expression under the square root, $m^2 - 16800$, must be a perfect square for the roots to be integers. Let's denote this perfect square as $k^2$, where $k$ is an integer. Therefore, $m^2 - 16800 = k^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the smallest positive $m$ that satisfies the condition.\nRearrange the equation to solve for $m$: $m^2 = k^2 + 16800$. To find the smallest positive $m$, we need the smallest $k$ that makes $m$ an integer. Since $m^2$ must be greater than 16800 to yield a real solution, the smallest possible value for $k$ that could result in an integer $m$ would be the smallest integer $k$ where $k^2$ is greater than or equal to 16800 but still results in a perfect square when added to 16800.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the smallest possible $m$.\nTo simplify the calculation, we look for the smallest perfect square greater than 16800, which is $129^2 = 16641$. The next perfect square is $130^2 = 16900$. Thus, $k = 130$ because $130^2 - 16800 = 100$, which is a perfect square, indicating that $m^2 = 16900$ would yield an integral solution for $x$. Therefore, $m = \\sqrt{16900} = 130$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{130}$"
