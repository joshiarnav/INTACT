    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem in terms of an equation\nLet's denote the integer as $x$. According to the problem, the square of $x$ is 48 more than its double. This can be written as $x^2 = 2x + 48$.\n\n## Step 2: Rearrange the equation into a quadratic equation\nTo solve for $x$, we need to rearrange the equation into the standard form of a quadratic equation: $x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation\nWe can solve the quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -2$, and $c = -48$. Plugging these values into the formula gives us $x = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(-48)}}{2(1)}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying inside the square root: $x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 192}}{2}$, which further simplifies to $x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{196}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for both values of $x$\nSince $\\sqrt{196} = 14$, we have $x = \\frac{2 \\pm 14}{2}$. This gives us two possible values for $x$: $x = \\frac{2 + 14}{2} = 8$ and $x = \\frac{2 - 14}{2} = -6$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the least integer\nBetween $8$ and $-6$, the least integer is $-6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-6}$"
