    "problem": "Joann rode her bike at an average speed of 12 miles per hour for three and a half hours. If her friend, Fran, rides for 3 hours, at what average speed, in miles per hour, would she have to ride her bike to travel the same distance that Joann traveled?",
    "solution": "In $3\\frac{1}{2}$ hours, Joann covers $\\left(3\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ hours}\\right)(12\\text{ mph})=42$ miles.  If Fran's average speed in miles per hour is $s$, then Fran covers $3s$ miles in $3$ hours.  Solving $3s=42$ we find $s=\\boxed{14}$ miles per hour.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled by Joann\nTo find the distance traveled by Joann, we need to multiply her average speed by the time she rode her bike. Distance = Speed * Time = 12 miles/hour * 3.5 hours = 42 miles.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the speed Fran needs to travel the same distance in 3 hours\nNow, we need to calculate the speed at which Fran must ride to cover the same distance of 42 miles in 3 hours. Speed = Distance / Time = 42 miles / 3 hours = 14 miles per hour.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$"
