    "problem": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the two distinct solutions to the equation $$\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15}=x+2.$$If $p > q$, what is the value of $p - q$?",
    "solution": "First we try factoring the left side to simplify it: $$\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15}=\\frac{4(x-3)}{(x-3)(x+5)}=\\frac{4}{x+5}.$$Now we can multiply both sides by $(x+5)$ and solve for $x$: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{4}{x+5}&=x+2\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n4&=(x+5)(x+2)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=x^2+7x+10\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=x^2+7x+6\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=(x+6)(x+1).\n\\end{align*}So $p=-1$ and $q=-6$, making $p-q=\\boxed{5}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Write down the given equation\nThe given equation is $\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15}=x+2$.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the denominator\nThe denominator can be factored as $x^2+2x-15 = (x+5)(x-3)$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the numerator\nThe numerator can be simplified as $4x-12 = 4(x-3)$.\n\n## Step 4: Rewrite the equation with the simplified numerator and factored denominator\nThe equation becomes $\\frac{4(x-3)}{(x+5)(x-3)}=x+2$.\n\n## Step 5: Cancel out the common factor (x-3) from the numerator and denominator\nWe can cancel out $(x-3)$ from the numerator and denominator, but we must note that $x \\neq 3$ since that would make the denominator zero. The equation becomes $\\frac{4}{x+5}=x+2$.\n\n## Step 6: Multiply both sides by (x+5) to eliminate the denominator\nMultiplying both sides by $(x+5)$ gives $4 = (x+2)(x+5)$.\n\n## Step 7: Expand the right side of the equation\nExpanding the right side gives $4 = x^2 + 7x + 10$.\n\n## Step 8: Rearrange the equation into a quadratic equation\nRearranging the equation gives $x^2 + 7x + 6 = 0$.\n\n## Step 9: Factor the quadratic equation\nFactoring the quadratic equation gives $(x+1)(x+6) = 0$.\n\n## Step 10: Solve for x\nSolving for $x$ gives $x = -1$ or $x = -6$.\n\n## Step 11: Determine p and q\nSince $p > q$, $p = -1$ and $q = -6$.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate p - q\nThe difference $p - q$ is $-1 - (-6) = 5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
