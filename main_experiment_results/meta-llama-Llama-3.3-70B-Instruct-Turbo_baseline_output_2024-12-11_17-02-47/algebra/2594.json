    "problem": "The third and fourth terms of a geometric sequence are 12 and 16, respectively. What is the first term of the sequence?",
    "solution": "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence. Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$. Solving, we have $a\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence\nThe formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is $a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{(n-1)}$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the term number.\n\n## Step 2: Set up equations based on the given terms\nGiven that the third term ($a_3$) is 12 and the fourth term ($a_4$) is 16, we can set up the following equations using the formula:\n$a_3 = a_1 \\cdot r^{(3-1)} = a_1 \\cdot r^2 = 12$\n$a_4 = a_1 \\cdot r^{(4-1)} = a_1 \\cdot r^3 = 16$\n\n## Step 3: Solve for the common ratio $r$\nTo find $r$, we can divide the equation for $a_4$ by the equation for $a_3$:\n$\\frac{a_1 \\cdot r^3}{a_1 \\cdot r^2} = \\frac{16}{12}$\nThis simplifies to $r = \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute $r$ back into one of the original equations to solve for $a_1$\nUsing $a_1 \\cdot r^2 = 12$ and $r = \\frac{4}{3}$, we substitute $r$:\n$a_1 \\cdot (\\frac{4}{3})^2 = 12$\n$a_1 \\cdot \\frac{16}{9} = 12$\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $a_1$\nMultiply both sides by $\\frac{9}{16}$ to solve for $a_1\"):\n$a_1 = 12 \\cdot \\frac{9}{16}$\n$a_1 = \\frac{108}{16}$\n$a_1 = \\frac{27}{4}$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$"
