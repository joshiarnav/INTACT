    "problem": "What is the value of $c$ if $x\\cdot(3x+1)<c$ if and only when $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$?",
    "solution": "When $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$, we have $x\\cdot(3x+1)-c<0$. This means that $x(3x+1)-c=0$ at $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x=2$. We now know that $x(3x+1)-c=0$ is a quadratic equation with roots at $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x=2$, and we want to use these roots to find a quadratic of the same form as the problem.  $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ gives us $(3x+7)=0$ and $x=2$ gives us $(x-2)=0$. \\begin{align*}\nx(3x+1)-c&=(3x+7)(x-2)\\\\\n&=3x^2+x-14\\\\\n&=x(3x+1)-14.\n\\end{align*} So, $c=\\boxed{14}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the given inequality and its conditions\nThe given inequality $x\\cdot(3x+1)<c$ needs to be satisfied if and only if $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$. This means the inequality holds true for all values of $x$ in the interval $\\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$ and does not hold true for $x$ outside this interval.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the quadratic function\nThe expression $x\\cdot(3x+1)$ can be simplified to $3x^2 + x$. This is a quadratic function, and its graph is a parabola that opens upwards because the coefficient of $x^2$ (which is 3) is positive.\n\n## Step 3: Finding critical points of the inequality\nTo find the critical points, we look at the values of $x$ where $3x^2 + x = c$. However, since we are given the interval $\\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$ where the inequality holds, we can use the endpoints of this interval to determine $c$. Plugging in $x = -\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x = 2$ into $3x^2 + x$ should give us the same value, which is $c$, because these are the points where the inequality transitions between being true and false.\n\n## Step 4: Calculating $c$ using the endpoints\nFor $x = -\\frac{7}{3}$:\n\\[3\\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right) = 3\\left(\\frac{49}{9}\\right) - \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{49}{3} - \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{42}{3} = 14.\\]\n\nFor $x = 2$:\n\\[3(2)^2 + 2 = 3(4) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14.\\]\n\nBoth calculations yield the same result, confirming that $c = 14$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$"
