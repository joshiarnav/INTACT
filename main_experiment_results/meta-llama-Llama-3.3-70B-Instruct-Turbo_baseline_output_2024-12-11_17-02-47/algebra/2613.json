    "problem": "The letters of the alphabet are each assigned a random integer value, and $H=10$. The value of a word comes from the sum of its letters' values. If $MATH$ is 35 points, $TEAM$ is 42 points and $MEET$ is 38 points, what is the value of $A$?",
    "solution": "$MATH$ is 35 points, and $H$ is 10 points, so $MAT$ is 25 points. $TEAM = E + MAT$, so $E = 42 - 25 = 17$ points. $MEET$ is 38 points, and $E$ is 17 points, so $MT = 38 - 2 \\cdot 17 = 4$ points. Finally, because $TEAM = E + MT + A$, we can solve for $A$: $17 + 4 + A = 42$, so $A= 42 - 17 - 4 = \\boxed{21}$ points.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify given information\nWe are given that each letter of the alphabet has a random integer value, with $H = 10$. We also have the following word values: $MATH = 35$, $TEAM = 42$, and $MEET = 38$. We need to find the value of the letter $A$.\n\n## Step 2: Set up equations based on the given word values\nFrom $MATH = 35$, we know that $M + A + T + H = 35$. Given $H = 10$, we can substitute this value into the equation to get $M + A + T + 10 = 35$ or $M + A + T = 25$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the value of $TEAM$ to set up another equation\nSince $TEAM = 42$, we have $T + E + A + M = 42$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the value of $MEET$ to set up another equation\nGiven $MEET = 38$, we get $M + E + E + T = 38$ or $M + 2E + T = 38$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the system of equations to find the value of $A$\nWe have three equations:\n1. $M + A + T = 25$\n2. $T + E + A + M = 42$\n3. $M + 2E + T = 38$\n\n## Step 6: Simplify and solve for $A$\nWe can simplify equation (2) by substituting $M + T$ from equation (1), yielding $25 + E = 42$ or $E = 17$ after subtracting $25$ from both sides.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute $E$ into equation (3) to find $M + T$\nSubstituting $E = 17$ into equation (3) gives $M + 2(17) + T = 38$, which simplifies to $M + 34 + T = 38$ or $M + T = 4$ after subtracting $34$ from both sides.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $A$ using the simplified equations\nNow that we have $M + T = 4$, we can substitute this back into the equation $M + A + T = 25$ to solve for $A$. Substituting $M + T = 4$ into this equation gives $4 + A = 25$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the value of $A$\nSolving for $A$ in $4 + A = 25$ gives $A = 25 - 4$ or $A = 21$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$"
