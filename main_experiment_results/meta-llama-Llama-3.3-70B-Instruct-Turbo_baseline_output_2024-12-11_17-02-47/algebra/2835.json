    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the coordinates of point E\nSince E is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$, its x-coordinate is the average of the x-coordinates of B and C, which is $\\frac{0+8}{2}=4$. The y-coordinate of E is the average of the y-coordinates of B and C, which is $\\frac{0+0}{2}=0$. Therefore, the coordinates of point E are (4,0).\n\n## Step 2: Determine the coordinates of point D\nSince D is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, its x-coordinate is the average of the x-coordinates of A and B, which is $\\frac{0+0}{2}=0$. The y-coordinate of D is the average of the y-coordinates of A and B, which is $\\frac{6+0}{2}=3$. Therefore, the coordinates of point D are (0,3).\n\n## Step 3: Find the equation of the line passing through points A and E\nTo find the equation of the line passing through points A(0,6) and E(4,0), we first need to find the slope of the line. The slope is given by $\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\\frac{0-6}{4-0}=\\frac{-6}{4}=-\\frac{3}{2}$. The equation of the line in slope-intercept form is $y=mx+b$, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Since the line passes through point A(0,6), we can substitute these values into the equation to find b: $6=-\\frac{3}{2}(0)+b \\Rightarrow b=6$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $y=-\\frac{3}{2}x+6$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the equation of the line passing through points C and D\nTo find the equation of the line passing through points C(8,0) and D(0,3), we first need to find the slope of the line. The slope is given by $\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\\frac{3-0}{0-8}=\\frac{3}{-8}=-\\frac{3}{8}$. The equation of the line in slope-intercept form is $y=mx+b$, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Since the line passes through point D(0,3), we can substitute these values into the equation to find b: $3=-\\frac{3}{8}(0)+b \\Rightarrow b=3$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $y=-\\frac{3}{8}x+3$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the point of intersection F of the two lines\nTo find the point of intersection F, we need to solve the system of equations:\n$y=-\\frac{3}{2}x+6$\n$y=-\\frac{3}{8}x+3$\nWe can set the two equations equal to each other:\n$-\\frac{3}{2}x+6=-\\frac{3}{8}x+3$\nMultiplying both sides by 8 to eliminate the fractions:\n$-12x+48=-3x+24$\nSubtracting 24 from both sides:\n$-12x+24=-3x$\nAdding 3x to both sides:\n$-9x+24=0$\nSubtracting 24 from both sides:\n$-9x=-24$\nDividing both sides by -9:\n$x=\\frac{-24}{-9}=\\frac{8}{3}$\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of point F, we can substitute it into one of the equations to find the y-coordinate. Using the first equation:\n$y=-\\frac{3}{2}(\\frac{8}{3})+6$\n$y=-4+6$\n$y=2$\nTherefore, the coordinates of point F are $(\\frac{8}{3}, 2)$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the sum of the x and y coordinates of point F\nThe sum of the x and y coordinates of point F is $\\frac{8}{3}+2$. To add these numbers, we need to find a common denominator, which is 3. So we can rewrite 2 as $\\frac{6}{3}$. Now we can add:\n$\\frac{8}{3}+\\frac{6}{3}=\\frac{14}{3}$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{14}{3}}$"
