    "problem": "The Cookie Monster encounters a cookie whose boundary is the equation $x^2+y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3 y$ and is very confused. He wants to know if this cookie is a lunch-sized cookie or a snack-sized cookie. What is the radius of this cookie?",
    "solution": "The equation $x^2+y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3 y$ can be rewritten as $x^2-x+y^2-3y=6.5$. Completing the square and writing decimals as fractions, this can further be rewritten as $\\left( x - \\dfrac{1}{2} \\right)^2 - \\dfrac{1}{4} + \\left( y - \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)^2 - \\dfrac{9}{4}=\\dfrac{13}{2}$. Moving the constants to the right side of the equation, this is $\\left( x - \\dfrac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( y - \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)^2 = \\dfrac{10}{4}+\\dfrac{13}{2}=\\dfrac{18}{2}=9$, which is the equation of a circle with center $\\left( \\dfrac{1}{2}, \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)$ and radius $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Rewrite the given equation to standard form\nThe given equation is $x^2 + y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3y$. To rewrite it in standard form, we need to move all terms to one side: $x^2 + y^2 - x - 3y - 6.5 = 0$.\n\n## Step 2: Complete the square for both x and y terms\nTo complete the square for $x$, we add $(\\frac{-1}{2})^2 = 0.25$ to both sides. For $y$, we add $(\\frac{-3}{2})^2 = 2.25$ to both sides. The equation becomes: $x^2 - x + 0.25 + y^2 - 3y + 2.25 = 6.5 + 0.25 + 2.25$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying, we get: $(x - 0.5)^2 + (y - 1.5)^2 = 9$.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the radius\nThe standard form of a circle's equation is $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $r$ is the radius. Comparing this with our equation, $r^2 = 9$, so $r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
