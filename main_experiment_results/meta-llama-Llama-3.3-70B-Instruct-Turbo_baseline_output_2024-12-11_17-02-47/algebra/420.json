    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Distribute the terms in the first part of the expression\nTo simplify the expression $5(3-i)+3i(5-i)$, we start by distributing the terms in the first part, which gives $5*3 - 5*i = 15 - 5i$.\n\n## Step 2: Distribute the terms in the second part of the expression\nNext, we distribute the terms in the second part of the expression, $3i(5-i)$. This gives $3i*5 - 3i*i = 15i - 3i^2$. Since $i^2 = -1$, we substitute this value in to get $15i - 3(-1) = 15i + 3$.\n\n## Step 3: Combine the results of the first and second parts of the expression\nNow, we combine the results from the first and second parts: $(15 - 5i) + (15i + 3)$. Combining like terms, we get $15 - 5i + 15i + 3 = 15 + 3 + 10i = 18 + 10i$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18 + 10i}$"
