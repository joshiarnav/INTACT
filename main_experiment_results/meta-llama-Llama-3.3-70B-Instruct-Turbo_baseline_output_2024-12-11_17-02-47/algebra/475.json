    "problem": "What is the greatest integer $x$ such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime?",
    "solution": "We can factor the quadratic $6x^2-47x+15$ as $(2x-15)(3x-1)$. So we have $|6x^2-47x+15|=|(2x-15)(3x-1)|=|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|$. In order for $|6x^2-47x+15|$ to be prime, its only divisors must be $1$ and itself. Thus one of $|2x-15|$ or $|3x-1|$ must be equal to $1$.\n\nIf $|3x-1|=1$, then $3x-1=1$ or $3x-1=-1$. These equations yield $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $x=0$, respectively. We throw out $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ since it is not an integer, and keep $x=0$ as a candidate.\n\nIf $|2x-15|=1$, then $2x-15=1$, in which case $2x=16$ and $x=8$, or $2x-15=-1$, in which case $2x=14$ and $x=7$.\n\nThus our candidates for the greatest $x$ are $0, 7$, and $8$. It remains to check whether the other factor is prime. We first check $x=8$. Since $|2x-15|=1$, we know $|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|=|3x-1|=|24-1|=23$, which is prime. Thus $\\boxed{8}$ is the largest integer for which $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To solve this problem, we first need to understand what a prime number is.\nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n## Step 2: We are given the expression $|6x^2-47x+15|$ and we are asked to find the greatest integer $x$ for which this expression is a prime number.\nTo simplify the expression, let's factor the quadratic equation $6x^2-47x+15$.\n\n## Step 3: Factor the quadratic equation $6x^2-47x+15$.\nThe equation can be factored as $(2x-15)(3x-1)$.\n\n## Step 4: Now we can rewrite the original expression as $|(2x-15)(3x-1)|$.\nFor $|(2x-15)(3x-1)|$ to be a prime number, its only divisors must be 1 and itself. This means that one of the factors $|2x-15|$ or $|3x-1|$ must be equal to 1, since the product of two numbers greater than 1 cannot be a prime number.\n\n## Step 5: Let's solve the equations $|2x-15|=1$ and $|3x-1|=1$ to find possible values of $x$.\nSolving $|2x-15|=1$ gives us two possible values: $x=8$ and $x=7$.\nSolving $|3x-1|=1$ gives us two possible values: $x=0$ and $x=\\frac{2}{3}$.\nSince $x$ must be an integer, we discard $x=\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n## Step 6: Now we need to check which of these values of $x$ (8, 7, and 0) produce a prime number when substituted into the expression $|(2x-15)(3x-1)|$.\nFor $x=8$, $|(2*8-15)(3*8-1)| = |(1)(23)| = 23$, which is a prime number.\nFor $x=7$, $|(2*7-15)(3*7-1)| = |(-1)(20)| = 20$, which is not a prime number.\nFor $x=0$, $|(2*0-15)(3*0-1)| = |(-15)(-1)| = 15$, which is not a prime number.\n\n## Step 7: From the previous step, we see that $x=8$ is the greatest integer for which $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is a prime number.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
