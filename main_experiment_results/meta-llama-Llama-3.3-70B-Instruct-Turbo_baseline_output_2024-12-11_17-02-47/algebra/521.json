    "problem": "Given positive integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x\\neq y$ and $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{18}$, what is the smallest possible value for $x + y$?",
    "solution": "Simplifying, we have  $18(x+y)=xy$, so $xy - 18x - 18y = 0$ Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick by adding 324 to both sides, we get $xy-18x-18y +324=324$, so \\[(x-18)(y-18)=324.\\]Now we seek the minimal $x+y,$ which occurs when $x-18$ and $y-18$ are as close to each other in value as possible. The two best candidates are $(x-18,y-18)=(12,27)$ or $(9,36),$ of which $(x,y)=(30,45)$ attains the minimum sum of $\\boxed{75}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Start by examining the given equation $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{18}$.\nWe need to find the smallest possible value for $x + y$ given this equation and the constraints that $x$ and $y$ are positive integers and $x \\neq y$.\n\n## Step 2: Manipulate the equation to get it in terms of $x$ and $y$.\nTo do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation: $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{y + x}{xy}$.\n\n## Step 3: Set the manipulated equation equal to $\\frac{1}{18}$.\nThis gives us $\\frac{y + x}{xy} = \\frac{1}{18}$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $xy$ in terms of $x$ and $y$.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $18xy$ gives $18(y + x) = xy$, which simplifies to $18x + 18y = xy$.\n\n## Step 5: Rearrange the equation to solve for $xy - 18x - 18y$.\nThis yields $xy - 18x - 18y = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick.\nAdding $18^2$ to both sides of the equation gives $xy - 18x - 18y + 18^2 = 18^2$, which can be factored into $(x - 18)(y - 18) = 18^2$.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the factor pairs of $18^2 = 324$.\nThe pairs are $(1, 324)$, $(2, 162)$, $(3, 108)$, $(4, 81)$, $(6, 54)$, $(9, 36)$, and $(12, 27)$, along with their corresponding negations. However, since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, we only consider positive factor pairs.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $x$ and $y$ using the factor pairs.\nFor $(1, 324)$, we get $x = 19$ and $y = 342$ or vice versa. For $(2, 162)$, we get $x = 20$ and $y = 180$ or vice versa. For $(3, 108)$, we get $x = 21$ and $y = 126$ or vice versa. For $(4, 81)$, we get $x = 22$ and $y = 99$ or vice versa. For $(6, 54)$, we get $x = 24$ and $y = 72$ or vice versa. For $(9, 36)$, we get $x = 27$ and $y = 54$ or vice versa. For $(12, 27)$, we get $x = 30$ and $y = 45$ or vice versa.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate $x + y$ for each pair and find the smallest sum.\nThe sums are $19 + 342 = 361$, $20 + 180 = 200$, $21 + 126 = 147$, $22 + 99 = 121$, $24 + 72 = 96$, $27 + 54 = 81$, and $30 + 45 = 75$. The smallest sum is $75$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{75}$"
