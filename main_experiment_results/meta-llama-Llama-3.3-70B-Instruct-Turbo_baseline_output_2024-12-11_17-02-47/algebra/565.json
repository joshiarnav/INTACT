    "problem": "What is the sum of all values of $k$ such that the equation $2x^2-kx+8=0$ has two distinct integer solutions?",
    "solution": "We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively. Let the two roots of the equation be $p$ and $q$. Then $p+q=k/2$. However the only other restriction on $p$ and $q$ is that $pq = 4$ and that $p$ and $q$ are distinct integers. For each such possibility $(p,q)$, we also have the possibility $(-p,-q)$ since $(-p)(-q) = pq = 4$. This gives two values of $k$: $k=2(p+q)$ and $k=2(-p-q)$. Since these occur in such pairs, the sum of all possible values of $k$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nAlternatively, one can note that the only way to factor 4 into 2 distinct integer factors is $4\\cdot1$ and $(-4)(-1)$, so that the two possible values of $k$ are $10$ and $-10$, given a sum of $0$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the condition for a quadratic equation to have two distinct integer solutions\nFor a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, it must have two distinct integer solutions if its discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is a perfect square and greater than zero.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the condition to the given equation $2x^2-kx+8=0$\nThe discriminant of the given equation is $(-k)^2-4(2)(8)$, which simplifies to $k^2-64$. For the equation to have two distinct integer solutions, $k^2-64$ must be a perfect square and greater than zero.\n\n## Step 3: Express the condition as an equation\nWe have $k^2-64 = m^2$, where $m$ is an integer and $m^2 > 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $k$\nRearranging the equation, we get $k^2 = m^2 + 64$. To find integer values of $k$ that satisfy this equation, we look for pairs of perfect squares that differ by 64.\n\n## Step 5: Find pairs of perfect squares that differ by 64\nBy inspection or trial and error, we find that the pairs of perfect squares that differ by 64 are $m^2 = 25$ and $k^2 = 89$ (since $89 - 25 = 64$), but $k^2 = 89$ does not yield an integer $k$. Another possible pair could be $m^2 = 49$ and $k^2 = 113$ (since $113 - 49 = 64$), but again, $k^2 = 113$ does not yield an integer $k$. However, considering $m^2 = 0$ and $k^2 = 64$ gives us $k = \\pm 8$.\n\n## Step 6: Apply Vieta's formulas to check for integer roots\nGiven that the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is $-\\frac{b}{a}$ and the product is $\\frac{c}{a}$, for our equation, the sum of the roots is $\\frac{k}{2}$ and the product is $\\frac{8}{2}=4$. Since we are looking for distinct integer roots and their product is 4, the possible pairs are $(1, 4)$ and $(-1, -4)$, as well as $(2, 2)$ and $(-2, -2)$, but the latter two pairs do not give distinct roots.\n\n## Step 7: Determine $k$ using the sum of the roots\nFor the roots $(1, 4)$, the sum is $5$, so $\\frac{k}{2} = 5$, which gives $k = 10$. For the roots $(-1, -4)$, the sum is $-5$, so $\\frac{k}{2} = -5$, which gives $k = -10$.\n\n## Step 8: Sum the values of $k$\nThe sum of all possible values of $k$ that yield distinct integer solutions is $10 + (-10) = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"
