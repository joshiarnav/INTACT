    "problem": "Two parabolas are the graphs of the equations $y=3x^2+4x-5$ and $y=x^2+11$. Give all points where they intersect. List the points in order of increasing $x$-coordinate, separated by semicolons.",
    "solution": "Setting the right-hand sides of the given equations equal gives $3x^2+4x-5=x^2+11$. Combining like terms gives $2x^2+4x=16$. Dividing by $2$ gives $x^2+2x=8$, and rearranging gives $x^2 +2x - 8=0$.  Factoring gives $(x+4)(x-2)=0$, so our solutions are $x=-4$ and $x=2$.  Substituting these into either of the original equations to find the corresponding values of $y$, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-4, 27);(2, 15)}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Set up the equations to find the intersection points\nTo find the intersection points of the two parabolas, we need to set the two equations equal to each other: $3x^2+4x-5=x^2+11$.\n\n## Step 2: Combine like terms and simplify the equation\nCombine like terms to get $3x^2 - x^2 + 4x - 5 - 11 = 0$, which simplifies to $2x^2 + 4x - 16 = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation for x\nWe can solve the quadratic equation $2x^2 + 4x - 16 = 0$ by factoring or using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 2$, $b = 4$, and $c = -16$. Plugging these values into the formula gives $x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^2 - 4*2*(-16)}}{2*2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the discriminant and solve for x\nThe discriminant is $b^2 - 4ac = 4^2 - 4*2*(-16) = 16 + 128 = 144$. So, $x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{144}}{4} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 12}{4}$. This gives two solutions for $x$: $x_1 = \\frac{-4 + 12}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2$ and $x_2 = \\frac{-4 - 12}{4} = \\frac{-16}{4} = -4$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the corresponding y-values for the intersection points\nNow that we have the $x$-values, we can substitute them back into one of the original equations to find the corresponding $y$-values. Using $y = x^2 + 11$, for $x = 2$, $y = 2^2 + 11 = 4 + 11 = 15$. For $x = -4$, $y = (-4)^2 + 11 = 16 + 11 = 27$.\n\n## Step 6: List the intersection points in order of increasing x-coordinate\nThe intersection points are $(-4, 27)$ and $(2, 15)$. In order of increasing $x$-coordinate, the points are $(-4, 27); (2, 15)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(-4, 27); (2, 15)}$"
