    "problem": "If a rectangular prism has a length of $l$, a width of $w$, and a height of $h$, then the length of its diagonal is equal to $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}$. Suppose $l = 3$ and $h = 12$; if the length of the diagonal is $13$, what is the width?",
    "solution": "We are given that $$\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + w^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{153 + w^2} = 13.$$Squaring both sides, it follows that $$153 + w^2 = 13^2 = 169 \\quad\\Longrightarrow \\quad w = \\pm 4.$$Since the width must be a positive quantity, the answer is $\\boxed{4}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and the formula for the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism.\nThe problem provides a formula for the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, which is $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}$. Given $l = 3$, $h = 12$, and the length of the diagonal is $13$, we need to find the width $w$.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the given values into the formula for the length of the diagonal.\nSubstituting $l = 3$, $h = 12$, and the diagonal length $= 13$ into the formula gives us $13 = \\sqrt{3^2 + w^2 + 12^2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the equation for $w$.\nSquaring both sides of the equation $13 = \\sqrt{3^2 + w^2 + 12^2}$ gives $169 = 9 + w^2 + 144$. Simplifying this, we get $169 = 153 + w^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Isolate $w^2$ and solve for $w$.\nSubtracting 153 from both sides of the equation $169 = 153 + w^2$ yields $16 = w^2$. Taking the square root of both sides gives us $w = \\pm 4$. Since width cannot be negative, $w = 4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
