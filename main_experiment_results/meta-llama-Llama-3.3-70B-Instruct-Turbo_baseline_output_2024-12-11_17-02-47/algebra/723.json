    "problem": "Suppose $x$ and $y$ are integers such that  $xy+5x+4y=-5$.  Find the greatest possible value of $y$.",
    "solution": "Note that $(x+4)(y+5)$ equals $xy+5x+4y+20$.  So, add $20$ to both sides of the original equation to get $xy+5x+4y+20=15$, so now we may apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and write the equation as $(x+4)(y+5)=15$.\n\nThen, the potential ordered pairs $((x+4),(y+5))$ with $x<y$ are $(-15,-1)$, $(-5,-3)$, $(1,15)$ and $(3,5)$, since these are the pairs of integers that multiply to 15.  The greatest value for $y+5$ is thus $15$.  We solve $y+5=15$ for $y$ to yield $y=\\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick\nTo solve the given equation $xy+5x+4y=-5$, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick. This trick involves adding a constant to both sides of the equation to make factoring easier. Adding 20 to both sides gives us $xy+5x+4y+20=15$.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the equation\nNow we can factor the equation into $(x+4)(y+5)=15$. This step is crucial as it allows us to find the possible values of $x$ and $y$ by considering the factors of 15.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the factors of 15\nThe factors of 15 are $\\pm1, \\pm3, \\pm5, \\pm15$. We need to consider all possible combinations of these factors to find the corresponding values of $x$ and $y$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the possible values of $y$\nFrom the factored equation $(x+4)(y+5)=15$, we can set up equations for $y+5$ using the factors of 15. The possible values for $y+5$ are $1, 3, 5, 15, -1, -3, -5, -15$. Solving for $y$ gives us the possible values of $y$ as $-4, -2, 0, 10, -6, -8, -10, -20$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the greatest possible value of $y$\nAmong the possible values of $y$, the greatest one is $10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
