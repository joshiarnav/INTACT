    "problem": "Alex has 12 friends and 63 coins. What is the minimum number of additional coins he needs so that he can give each friend at least one coin and no two friends receive the same number of coins?",
    "solution": "Alex wants to minimize the number of coins he gives to his friends without giving any two of them the same number of coins. The minimum number of coins he can give to a friend is 1. He then gives 2 coins to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 12. The total number of coins Alex has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+12 = \\frac{12 \\cdot 13}{2}=78$.  Thus, Alex needs $78-63=\\boxed{15}$ more coins.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the minimum number of coins Alex needs to distribute among his friends such that each friend gets at least one coin and no two friends receive the same number of coins.\nTo achieve this, we need to consider the minimum number of coins that can be distributed in a unique, sequential manner. Since Alex has 12 friends, the sequence of coins given to each friend would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of coins needed for this distribution.\nThe sum of the first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula: sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2. In this case, n = 12, so the total number of coins needed is (12 * (12 + 1)) / 2 = (12 * 13) / 2 = 156 / 2 = 78.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the minimum number of additional coins Alex needs to achieve this distribution.\nSince Alex already has 63 coins, we subtract this from the total number of coins needed: 78 - 63 = 15.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
