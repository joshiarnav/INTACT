    "problem": "Anton has two species of ants, Species A and Species B, in his ant farm. The two species are identical in appearance, but Anton knows that every day, there are twice as many ants of Species A than before, while there are three times as many ants of Species B. On Day 0, Anton counts that there are 30 ants in his ant farm. On Day 5, Anton counts that there are 3281 ants in his ant farm. How many of these are of Species A?",
    "solution": "Suppose that there are $a$ ants of Species A and $b$ ants of Species B on Day 0. We thus have that $a+b=30$. Notice that on Day 1, there will be $2a$ ants of Species A, on Day 2, there will be $2(2a) = 4a$ ants of Species A, and on Day 3, there will be $2(4a)=8a$ ants of Species A, etc. Following this line of reasoning, on Day 5, there will be $2^5a$ ants of Species A and $3^5b$ ants of Species B, meaning that $32a+243b=3281$. We now solve this system of linear equations. We have that $32a+32b=960$, so \\begin{align*}(32a+243b)-(32a+32b) &= 211b \\\\\n&= 3281-960 \\\\\n&= 2321.\\end{align*}We then have $b = \\frac{2321}{211} = 11$. This means that $a=30-11=19$, and there are $32\\cdot 19 = \\boxed{608}$ ants of Species A on Day 5.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the variables for the initial number of ants of Species A and Species B\nLet's denote the initial number of ants of Species A as $a$ and the initial number of ants of Species B as $b$. On Day 0, we have $a + b = 30$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ants of each species on Day 5\nSince the number of ants of Species A doubles every day, on Day 5, there will be $2^5 \\cdot a = 32a$ ants of Species A. Similarly, since the number of ants of Species B triples every day, on Day 5, there will be $3^5 \\cdot b = 243b$ ants of Species B.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the total number of ants on Day 5\nWe are given that on Day 5, there are 3281 ants in total. Therefore, $32a + 243b = 3281$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the system of equations to find the values of $a$ and $b$\nWe have two equations:\n1. $a + b = 30$\n2. $32a + 243b = 3281$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find $a$ and $b$.\n\n## Step 5: Express $b$ in terms of $a$ from the first equation\nFrom the first equation, $b = 30 - a$.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute $b$ in the second equation and solve for $a$\nSubstitute $b = 30 - a$ into $32a + 243b = 3281$:\n$32a + 243(30 - a) = 3281$.\nExpanding gives:\n$32a + 7290 - 243a = 3281$.\nCombining like terms:\n$-211a = -4009$.\nSolving for $a$:\n$a = 19$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of ants of Species A on Day 5\nSince $a = 19$, the number of ants of Species A on Day 5 is $32a = 32 \\cdot 19 = 608$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{608}$"
