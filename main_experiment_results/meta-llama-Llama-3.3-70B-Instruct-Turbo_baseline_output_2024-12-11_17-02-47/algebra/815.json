    "problem": "The product of two positive integers plus their sum is 103. The integers are relatively prime, and each is less than 20. What is the sum of the two integers?",
    "solution": "Let our numbers be $a$ and $b$ with $a>b.$ Then $ab+a+b=103$. With Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick in mind, we add $1$ to both sides and get $ab+a+b+1 = 104$, which factors as $(a+1)(b+1)=104$. We consider pairs $(a+1, b+1)$ of factors of $104$: $(104,1), (52,2), (26,4), (13,8)$. Since $a<20$, we can rule out the first 3 pairs, which gives $a=12$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\\boxed{19}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem and establish the equation\nLet's denote the two positive integers as $x$ and $y$. According to the problem, the product of the two integers plus their sum is 103. This can be expressed as $xy + x + y = 103$. We also know that $x$ and $y$ are relatively prime and each is less than 20.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick\nTo solve the equation $xy + x + y = 103$, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, which involves adding 1 to both sides of the equation. This gives us $xy + x + y + 1 = 104$. The equation can now be factored into $(x+1)(y+1) = 104$.\n\n## Step 3: Factorize 104 and find pairs of factors\nWe need to find pairs of factors of 104 such that $x+1$ and $y+1$ are both less than 21 (since $x$ and $y$ are less than 20). The factors of 104 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 26, 52, and 104. Possible pairs of factors are (1, 104), (2, 52), (4, 26), and (8, 13).\n\n## Step 4: Check each pair of factors for relatively prime integers less than 20\n- For (1, 104), we have $x=0$ and $y=103$, which does not satisfy the conditions.\n- For (2, 52), we have $x=1$ and $y=51$, which does not satisfy the condition that both integers are less than 20.\n- For (4, 26), we have $x=3$ and $y=25$, which also does not satisfy the condition.\n- For (8, 13), we have $x=7$ and $y=12$, which satisfies all the given conditions: both are positive integers less than 20, and they are relatively prime.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the sum of the two integers\nNow that we have found the integers $x=7$ and $y=12$, we can calculate their sum: $7 + 12 = 19$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$"
