    "problem": "The graph of a certain quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertex $(-4,0)$ which passes through the point $(1,-75)$.  What is the value of $a$?",
    "solution": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic must be of the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$.  The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, which gives us the equation $-75 = 25a$.  Hence, $a = -75/25 = \\boxed{-3}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the vertex form of a quadratic equation\nThe vertex form of a quadratic equation is $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the vertex into the vertex form of the quadratic equation\nGiven the vertex $(-4, 0)$, the equation can be written as $y = a(x + 4)^2 + 0$ or simply $y = a(x + 4)^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the given point to solve for $a$\nThe point $(1, -75)$ lies on the parabola, so substituting $x = 1$ and $y = -75$ into the equation $y = a(x + 4)^2$ gives $-75 = a(1 + 4)^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $a$\nSimplifying the equation gives $-75 = a(5)^2$, which further simplifies to $-75 = 25a$. Solving for $a$ gives $a = -75 / 25$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the value of $a$\nCalculating $-75 / 25$ gives $a = -3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-3}$"
