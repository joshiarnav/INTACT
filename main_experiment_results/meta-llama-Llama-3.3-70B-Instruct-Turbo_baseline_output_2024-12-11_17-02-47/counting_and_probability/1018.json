    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to get exactly 8 heads in 10 flips\nWe need to calculate the number of combinations of getting exactly 8 heads out of 10 flips. This can be calculated using the combination formula $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where n is the total number of flips and k is the number of heads we want. So, $C(10, 8) = \\frac{10!}{8!(10-8)!}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of combinations for getting exactly 8 heads\nCalculating $C(10, 8) = \\frac{10!}{8!(2)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45$. This means there are 45 ways to get exactly 8 heads in 10 flips.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the total number of possible outcomes for 10 flips\nSince each flip has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails), the total number of outcomes for 10 flips is $2^{10} = 1024$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of getting exactly 8 heads in 10 flips\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes (getting exactly 8 heads) divided by the total number of outcomes. So, the probability is $\\frac{45}{1024}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{45}{1024}}$"
