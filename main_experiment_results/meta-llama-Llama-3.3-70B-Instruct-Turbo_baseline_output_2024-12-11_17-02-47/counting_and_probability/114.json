    "problem": "Bob rolls a fair six-sided die each morning. If Bob rolls a composite number, he eats sweetened cereal. If he rolls a prime number, he eats unsweetened cereal. If he rolls a 1, then he rolls again. In a non-leap year, what is the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal?

    "solution": "Bob is equally likely to end up rolling a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Three of these numbers are prime and two are composite, so there is a $\\frac{3}{5}$ chance he will eat unsweetened cereal and a $\\frac{2}{5}$ chance that he will eat sweetened cereal. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, so the expected value of the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal is $\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot365=219$ and the expected value of the number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal is $\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot365=146$. The difference between 219 days and 146 days is $\\boxed{73}$ days.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the possible outcomes for Bob's die roll.\nBob can roll a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 on his fair six-sided die. However, if he rolls a 1, he rolls again. So, the effective possible outcomes are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n## Step 2: Classify each outcome as prime or composite to determine the type of cereal Bob eats.\n- 2 is a prime number.\n- 3 is a prime number.\n- 4 is a composite number.\n- 5 is a prime number.\n- 6 is a composite number.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of Bob eating unsweetened cereal (prime numbers) and sweetened cereal (composite numbers).\nThere are 3 prime numbers (2, 3, 5) and 2 composite numbers (4, 6) in the effective outcomes.\n- Probability of eating unsweetened cereal = 3/5\n- Probability of eating sweetened cereal = 2/5\n\n## Step 4: Determine the number of days in a non-leap year.\nA non-leap year has 365 days.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the expected number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and sweetened cereal in a non-leap year.\n- Expected days of unsweetened cereal = (3/5) * 365\n- Expected days of sweetened cereal = (2/5) * 365\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal.\nExpected difference = Expected days of unsweetened cereal - Expected days of sweetened cereal\n= (3/5) * 365 - (2/5) * 365\n= (3/5 - 2/5) * 365\n= (1/5) * 365\n= 73\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{73}$"
