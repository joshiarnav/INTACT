    "problem": "How many three-digit numbers are multiples of neither 5 nor 7?",
    "solution": "It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 5 or 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \\times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 that is a three-digit number is $142 \\times 7 = 994$.  Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7.  The smallest multiple of 5 that is a three-digit number is $20\\times 5 = 100$, and the largest multiple of 5 that is a three digit number is $199\\times 5 =995$. So there are $199-20+1=180$ multiples of 5.\n\nNow notice that we have counted some numbers twice: those multiples of $5\\times7=35$. The smallest multiple of 35 is $3\\times 35 = 105$, the largest multiple of 35 is $28\\times35 =980$. So there are $28-3+1=26$ multiples of 35.\n\nWe have 128 multiples of 7 and 180 multiples of 5, but we count 26 multiples twice.  So, there are a total of $128+180-26 = 282$ distinct three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 (or both).   There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-282=\\boxed{618}$ three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7 nor 5.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of three-digit numbers.\nTo find the total number of three-digit numbers, we consider numbers from 100 to 999. Since the first digit can be any number from 1 to 9 (9 options), the second digit can be any number from 0 to 9 (10 options), and the third digit can also be any number from 0 to 9 (10 options), the total number of three-digit numbers is calculated as follows: $9 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 900$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of multiples of 5 within the three-digit range.\nThe first multiple of 5 in the three-digit range is 100 and the last is 995. To find how many multiples of 5 there are, we can use the formula: $\\frac{Last\\ term\\ -\\ First\\ term}{Common\\ difference} + 1$. Applying this formula gives: $\\frac{995 - 100}{5} + 1 = \\frac{895}{5} + 1 = 179 + 1 = 180$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of multiples of 7 within the three-digit range.\nThe first multiple of 7 in the three-digit range is 105 and the last is 994. Using the same formula as before: $\\frac{994 - 105}{7} + 1 = \\frac{889}{7} + 1 = 127 + 1 = 128$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of multiples of 35 (the least common multiple of 5 and 7) within the three-digit range.\nSince multiples of 35 are counted twice (as multiples of 5 and 7), we need to find how many multiples of 35 are in the range to adjust our count. The first multiple of 35 in the three-digit range is 105 and the last is 980. Using the formula: $\\frac{980 - 105}{35} + 1 = \\frac{875}{35} + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7.\nTo find the total number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7, we add the number of multiples of 5 and 7 and then subtract the number of multiples of 35 to avoid double counting: $180 + 128 - 26 = 282$.\n\n## Step 6: Subtract the total number of multiples of 5 or 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers to find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7.\nFinally, to find the number of three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 5 or 7, we subtract the total number of multiples of 5 or 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers: $900 - 282 = 618$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{618}$"
