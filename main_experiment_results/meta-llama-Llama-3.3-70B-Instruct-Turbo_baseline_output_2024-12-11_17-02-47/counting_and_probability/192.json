We note that the points that are closer to $A$ than they are to $C$ are the points that are on the same side of $\\ell$ as $A$.

Since triangle $ABC$'s area is $\\frac{3 \\cdot 4}{2}$, it follows that the probability we seek is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$, as before.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To solve this problem, we need to determine the area of the region where point P is closer to C than it is to either A or B.\nThe region where P is closer to C than it is to either A or B can be found by drawing the perpendicular bisectors of segments AC and BC.\n\n## Step 2: Drawing the perpendicular bisectors of segments AC and BC will divide triangle ABC into different regions.\nThe perpendicular bisector of AC will divide triangle ABC into two regions: one where P is closer to A and one where P is closer to C. Similarly, the perpendicular bisector of BC will divide triangle ABC into two regions: one where P is closer to B and one where P is closer to C.\n\n## Step 3: The region where P is closer to C than it is to either A or B is the area where the two regions closer to C overlap.\nThis overlapping region is the area of the triangle formed by the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of AC and BC and side AB of triangle ABC.\n\n## Step 4: To find the probability that P is closer to C than it is to either A or B, we need to find the ratio of the area of this overlapping region to the area of triangle ABC.\nThis ratio will give us the probability that a randomly selected point P is closer to C than it is to either A or B.\n\n## Step 5: Since triangle ABC is a 3-4-5 right triangle, we can use its area to calculate the probability.\nThe area of triangle ABC can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is base times height divided by 2.\n\n## Step 6: Calculating the area of triangle ABC.\nThe area of triangle ABC = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 3 * 4 = 6.\n\n## Step 7: The region where P is closer to C than it is to either A or B is a rectangle with sides 1 and 2 (which is half the area of the 2x2 square formed by the perpendicular bisectors and side AB), and a right triangle with sides 1 and 2.\nHowever, considering the geometry and the fact that the perpendicular bisector of the hypotenuse of a right triangle divides the triangle into two smaller congruent triangles, and the bisectors of the other two sides divide the triangle into four smaller congruent triangles, the area where P is closer to C is actually half the area of triangle ABC.\n\n## Step 8: Calculating the area of the region where P is closer to C than it is to either A or B.\nThe area of this region is half the area of triangle ABC, which is 6 / 2 = 3, but considering the logic provided in step 7, the correct way to find the area where P is closer to C than to A or B involves understanding the geometric properties of the triangle and its bisectors.\n\n## Step 9: The correct way to find the probability involves understanding that the region closer to C than to A or B, given the properties of a right triangle and its bisectors, actually covers half of the triangle's area.\nGiven the properties of right triangles and the behavior of perpendicular bisectors, the region of interest for point P covers half of the area of triangle ABC.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the probability.\nThe probability = (area of the region closer to C) / (area of triangle ABC) = (1/2) * area of triangle ABC / area of triangle ABC = 1/2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$"
