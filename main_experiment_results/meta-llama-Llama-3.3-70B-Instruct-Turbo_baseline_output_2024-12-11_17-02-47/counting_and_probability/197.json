    "problem": "A pirate is searching for buried treasure on 6 islands. On each island, there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that the island has buried treasure and no traps, a $\\frac{1}{12}$ chance that the island has traps but no treasure, and a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance that the island has neither traps nor treasure. What is the probability that while searching all 6 islands, the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure, and none with traps?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose 3 islands. For each of these choices, there is a probability of $\\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3$ that the chosen islands have treasure and the remaining ones have neither treasure nor traps. Therefore, the probability that the pirate encounters exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps is $20 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the probability of an island having treasure and no traps\nThe probability of an island having treasure and no traps is given as $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the probability of an island having neither treasure nor traps\nThe probability of an island having neither treasure nor traps is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 islands out of 6 for the treasure islands\nThe number of ways to choose 3 islands out of 6 for the treasure islands can be calculated using combinations. This is given by $\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of 3 islands having treasure and no traps, and 3 islands having neither treasure nor traps\nThe probability of 3 islands having treasure and no traps is $(\\frac{1}{4})^3$, and the probability of 3 islands having neither treasure nor traps is $(\\frac{2}{3})^3$. Since these are independent events, we multiply these probabilities together: $(\\frac{1}{4})^3 \\times (\\frac{2}{3})^3$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the combined probability of exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps\nThe combined probability is the product of the number of ways to choose the islands and the probability of those islands having the specified conditions: $20 \\times (\\frac{1}{4})^3 \\times (\\frac{2}{3})^3$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression\n$20 \\times (\\frac{1}{4})^3 \\times (\\frac{2}{3})^3 = 20 \\times \\frac{1}{64} \\times \\frac{8}{27} = 20 \\times \\frac{8}{1728} = 20 \\times \\frac{1}{216} = \\frac{20}{216} = \\frac{5}{54}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$"
