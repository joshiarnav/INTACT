    "problem": "An unfair coin lands on heads with probability $\\frac34$ and tails with probability $\\frac14$.  A heads flip gains $\\$3$, but a tails flip loses $\\$8$.  What is the expected worth of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "By definition, we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities, and add them up: $E = \\frac34(+\\$3) + \\frac14(-\\$8) = \\boxed{\\$0.25}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the probabilities of the two outcomes\nThe probability of landing on heads is $\\frac{3}{4}$ and the probability of landing on tails is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the worth of each outcome\nA heads flip gains $\\$3$ and a tails flip loses $\\$8$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the expected worth of a coin flip\nThe expected worth of a coin flip is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing the results. So, the expected worth is $(\\frac{3}{4})(\\$3) + (\\frac{1}{4})(-\\$8)$.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the arithmetic\n$(\\frac{3}{4})(\\$3) = \\$2.25$ and $(\\frac{1}{4})(-\\$8) = -\\$2.00$. The expected worth is $\\$2.25 - \\$2.00 = \\$0.25$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.25}$"
