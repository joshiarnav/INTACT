    "problem": "Suppose 5 different integers are randomly chosen from between 20 and 69, inclusive.  What is the probability that they each have a different tens digit?",
    "solution": "In this set of integers, there are 5 tens digits: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.  If 5 integers all have different tens digits, then there must be exactly one integer among the 5 with each tens digit.  Since there are 10 different integers for each tens digit, the number of ways to pick, without regard to order, 5 different integers with different tens digits is $10^5$.  The total number of combinations of 5 integers is $\\binom{50}{5}$.  So the probability that 5 integers drawn all have the different tens digits is $$ \\frac{10^5}{\\binom{50}{5}} = \\frac{100000}{2118760} = \\boxed{\\frac{2500}{52969}}. $$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the range of tens digits in the given numbers\nThe tens digits in the numbers from 20 to 69 are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. There are 5 different tens digits.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the total number of ways to choose 5 different integers from the given range\nTo choose 5 different integers from the 50 numbers (20 to 69 inclusive), we use combinations since the order does not matter. The total number of ways to choose 5 integers out of 50 is given by the combination formula $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, $C(50, 5) = \\frac{50!}{5!(50-5)!}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 integers with different tens digits\nFor each tens digit (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), there are 10 different units digits (0 through 9). Since we need 5 different tens digits and each tens digit can be combined with any of the 10 units digits, we have 10 choices for each of the 5 tens digits. Therefore, the number of ways to choose 5 integers with different tens digits is $10^5$ because for each of the 5 tens digits, we have 10 options (units digits) to choose from.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability\nThe probability that the 5 integers each have a different tens digit is the number of favorable outcomes (choosing 5 integers with different tens digits) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (total number of ways to choose 5 integers from the given range). So, the probability is $\\frac{10^5}{C(50, 5)}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the combination\n$C(50, 5) = \\frac{50!}{5!(50-5)!} = \\frac{50 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times 47 \\times 46}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 2,118,760$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final probability\nThe final probability is $\\frac{10^5}{2,118,760} = \\frac{100,000}{2,118,760}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction\n$\\frac{100,000}{2,118,760} = \\frac{2500}{52969}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2500}{52969}}$"
