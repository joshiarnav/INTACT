    "solution": "Since $12! = 12 \\cdot 11!$, we can examine the sum better by factoring $11!$ out of both parts: $$ 11! + 12! = 11! + 12 \\cdot 11! = 11!(1 + 12) = 11! \\cdot 13. $$Since no prime greater than 11 divides $11!$, $\\boxed{13}$ is the largest prime factor of $11! + 12!$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are tasked with finding the largest prime divisor of the expression $11! + 12!$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the expression\nFirst, let's simplify the given expression. We can factor out $11!$ from both terms: $11! + 12! = 11! + 12 \\times 11! = 11!(1 + 12) = 11! \\times 13$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify prime divisors\nNow, we need to consider the prime divisors of $11! \\times 13$. The prime divisors of $11!$ are all the prime numbers up to 11, which are $2, 3, 5, 7, 11$. Additionally, we have the prime number $13$ from the simplified expression.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the largest prime divisor\nAmong these prime divisors, we need to find the largest one. Since $13$ is larger than any prime divisor of $11!$, it is the largest prime divisor of the expression $11! + 12!$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$"
