    "problem": "Four horizontal lines and four vertical lines are drawn in a plane. In how many ways can four lines be chosen such that a rectangular region is enclosed?",
    "solution": "In order for the four lines to enclose a rectangular region, we must choose two horizontal and two vertical lines.  If we were to choose more than two of one of these types of lines, we would not be able to enclose any region.  We can count independently the number of ways to choose vertical and horizontal lines.  There will be $\\dbinom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose horizontal lines, and the same number of ways to choose two vertical lines.  Since these are independent, there are a total of $6\\cdot 6=\\boxed{36}$ ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the requirements for a rectangle\nTo enclose a rectangular region, we need to choose two horizontal lines and two vertical lines.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose two horizontal lines\nWe have four horizontal lines, and we need to choose two of them. This can be calculated using combinations, specifically \"4 choose 2\", which is denoted as C(4, 2) or sometimes as $\\binom{4}{2}$. The formula for combinations is $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. So, for the horizontal lines, we have $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\cdot 2} = 6$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose two vertical lines\nSimilarly, we have four vertical lines, and we need to choose two of them. Using the same combination formula, we get $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose two vertical lines.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle\nTo find the total number of ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle, we multiply the number of ways to choose two horizontal lines by the number of ways to choose two vertical lines. So, $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$"
