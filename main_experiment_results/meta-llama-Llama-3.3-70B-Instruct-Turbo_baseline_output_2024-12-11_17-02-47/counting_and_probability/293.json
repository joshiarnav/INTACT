    "problem": "William is taking the 25-question, multiple choice American Mathematics Competition. Each question has five answer choices. William guesses random answers for the last four questions. What is the probability that he will get at least one of these final four questions right?",
    "solution": "We find the probability that William misses the last four questions, and subtract from 1. The probability of William missing a question is $\\frac{4}{5}$, so the probability that he misses all four is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = \\frac{256}{625}$. The probability that he gets at least one right is $1-\\frac{256}{625} =\\boxed{\\frac{369}{625}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the probability of getting a single question wrong\nThe probability of getting a single question wrong is calculated by subtracting the probability of getting it right from 1. Since there are 5 answer choices and only one is correct, the probability of getting a question right is 1/5. Therefore, the probability of getting a question wrong is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of getting all 4 questions wrong\nTo find the probability of getting at least one question right, we first calculate the probability of getting all 4 questions wrong. Since the probability of getting a single question wrong is 4/5, the probability of getting all 4 questions wrong is (4/5)^4.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate (4/5)^4\n(4/5)^4 = 256/625.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the probability of getting at least one question right\nThe probability of getting at least one question right is 1 minus the probability of getting all 4 questions wrong. So, the probability is 1 - 256/625.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate 1 - 256/625\n1 - 256/625 = 369/625.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{369}{625}}$"
