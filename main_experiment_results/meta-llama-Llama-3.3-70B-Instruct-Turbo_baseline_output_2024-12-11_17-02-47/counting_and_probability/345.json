    "problem": "If two distinct numbers are selected at random from the first seven prime numbers, what is the probability that their sum is an even number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2. There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum IS even is $1-\\frac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the first seven prime numbers.\nThe first seven prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the total number of ways to select two distinct numbers from the first seven prime numbers.\nTo find the total number of ways to select two distinct numbers from the seven prime numbers, we use the combination formula: $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Here, $n = 7$ and $k = 2$, so the total number of ways is $C(7, 2) = \\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify which prime numbers are odd and which is even.\nFrom the list of the first seven prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17), the only even prime number is 2, and the rest (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17) are odd.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the number of ways to select two numbers such that their sum is even.\nFor the sum of two numbers to be even, either both numbers must be even or both must be odd. Since there is only one even prime number (2) in the list, the number of ways to select two even numbers is $C(1, 2) = 0$ (because we cannot select two distinct numbers from a single number). The number of ways to select two odd numbers from the six odd prime numbers is $C(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers selected at random is even.\nThe probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (sum is even) by the total number of outcomes. So, the probability is $\\frac{15}{21}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the fraction if necessary.\nThe fraction $\\frac{15}{21}$ can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. Thus, $\\frac{15}{21} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$"
