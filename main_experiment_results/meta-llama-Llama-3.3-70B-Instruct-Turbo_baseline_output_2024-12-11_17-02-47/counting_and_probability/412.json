    "solution": "There are eight vertices of a cube, and we choose three of these to form a triangle. Thus, the number of distinct triangles that can be formed is $\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8\\cdot7\\cdot6}{3\\cdot2} = \\boxed{56}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of vertices in a cube.\nA cube has 8! = 8 vertices.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of distinct triangles that can be formed.\nTo form a triangle, we need to choose 3 different vertices out of the 8 available. This is a combination problem, where the order of selection doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / [(n-r)! * r!], where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items being chosen. For this problem, n = 8 (the number of vertices) and r = 3 (the number of vertices needed to form a triangle).\n\n## Step 3: Apply the combination formula to find the number of distinct triangles.\nUsing the combination formula: nCr = 8! / [(8-3)! * 3!]. Simplifying this gives: 8! / [5! * 3!]. Calculating the factorials: 8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40320, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120, and 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6. Then, substituting these values back into the formula: 40320 / [120 * 6].\n\n## Step 4: Complete the calculation to find the number of distinct triangles.\n40320 / [120 * 6] = 40320 / 720 = 56.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{56}$"
