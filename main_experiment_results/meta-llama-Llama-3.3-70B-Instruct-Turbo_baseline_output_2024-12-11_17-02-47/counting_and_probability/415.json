    "problem": "The numbers from 1 to 150, inclusive, are placed in a bag and a number is randomly selected from the bag. What is the probability it is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "It is easier to count the number of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. We see there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150, namely $1^{2}, 2^{2}, \\ldots, 12^{2}$, and there are 5 perfect cubes, namely $1^{3}, \\ldots, 5^{3}$. Then notice there are two repetitions, $1^{6} =1^2 = 1^3 = 1$ and $2^{6} = 8^2 = 4^3 = 64$. So there is a total of $12+5-2=15$ integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Thus, we get $150-15=135$ integers from 1 to 150 that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes. So the probability that we select such a number is $\\frac{135}{150} = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the total number of outcomes when selecting a number from 1 to 150.\nThe total number of outcomes is 150, since there are 150 numbers in the bag.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the numbers that are perfect squares from 1 to 150.\nTo find the perfect squares, we need to identify the numbers that can be expressed as $n^2$ where $n$ is an integer. The perfect squares from 1 to 150 are $1^2=1$, $2^2=4$, $3^2=9$, $4^2=16$, $5^2=25$, $6^2=36$, $7^2=49$, $8^2=64$, $9^2=81$, $10^2=100$, $11^2=121$, and $12^2=144$. There are 12 perfect squares.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the numbers that are perfect cubes from 1 to 150.\nTo find the perfect cubes, we need to identify the numbers that can be expressed as $n^3$ where $n$ is an integer. The perfect cubes from 1 to 150 are $1^3=1$, $2^3=8$, $3^3=27$, $4^3=64$, and $5^3=125$. There are 5 perfect cubes.\n\n## Step 4: Identify any overlap between the perfect squares and perfect cubes.\nThe numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes (in other words, sixth powers) are $1^6=1$ and $2^6=64$. There are 2 numbers that are counted twice.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of unique perfect squares and perfect cubes.\nThe total number of unique perfect squares and perfect cubes is the sum of perfect squares and perfect cubes minus the overlap to avoid double counting. This is $12 + 5 - 2 = 15$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability that a selected number is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube.\nThe probability that a number is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube is $1 - \\frac{15}{150}$. Simplifying this gives $1 - \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{9}{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$"
