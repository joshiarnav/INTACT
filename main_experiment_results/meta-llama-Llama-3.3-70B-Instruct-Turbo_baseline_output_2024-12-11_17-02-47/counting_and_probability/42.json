    "problem": "How many different positive, four-digit integers can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9 and 9?",
    "solution": "We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting. That is, if we had 4 distinct digits, there would be $4! = 24$ orderings. However, we must divide by 2! once for the repetition of the digit 2, and divide by 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digit were different we would have twice as many orderings). So, our answer is $\\frac{4!}{2!\\cdot 2!} = 2 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{6}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of digits available\nThere are 4 digits available: 2, 2, 9, and 9.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of arrangements if all digits were unique\nIf all digits were unique, the number of arrangements would be 4! (4 factorial), which equals 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24.\n\n## Step 3: Account for repeated digits\nSince the digit 2 is repeated twice and the digit 9 is also repeated twice, we must divide the total number of arrangements by the factorial of the number of times each digit is repeated. For the two 2's, we divide by 2! (2 factorial), and for the two 9's, we also divide by 2! (2 factorial).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final number of arrangements\nThe final number of arrangements is calculated as 4! / (2! * 2!), which equals 24 / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
