    "problem": "In how many different ways can four students stand in a straight line if two of the students refuse to stand next to each other?",
    "solution": "We will count the number of ways in which the two students do stand next to each other and then subtract that from the total number of ways all four students can stand in a line without the restriction. If the two students stand next to each other, then we can treat them as a block. There are three blocks: two one-student blocks and one two-student block. We can arrange the blocks in $3!=6$ ways, and there are 2 ways to arrange the students within the two-student block, for a total of $6\\cdot2=12$ ways. The total number of ways to arrange all four students in a line without restrictions is $4!=24$ ways. Thus, the number of ways with the restriction is $24-12=\\boxed{12}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways four students can stand in a line without any restrictions.\nThe total number of ways to arrange four students in a line is given by 4!, which equals 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways the two students who refuse to stand next to each other are together.\nIf we consider the two students who refuse to stand next to each other as a single entity, then we have three entities in total (the pair and the two other students). These three entities can be arranged in 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 ways. However, the two students within the pair can also be arranged between themselves in 2! = 2 ways. So, the total number of ways the two students can stand next to each other is 6 * 2 = 12.\n\n## Step 3: Subtract the number of ways the two students are together from the total number of ways to get the number of ways they are not together.\nTo find the number of ways the four students can stand in a line with the restriction that two of them do not stand next to each other, we subtract the number of ways they can stand together from the total number of ways. So, 24 - 12 = 12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
