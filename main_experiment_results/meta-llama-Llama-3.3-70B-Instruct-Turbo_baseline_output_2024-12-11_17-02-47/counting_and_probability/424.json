    "problem": "How many three digit numbers are left if we exclude all three digit numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent?",
    "solution": "The only three digit numbers which are ruled out are numbers of the form $ABA$, where A and B are different digits. There are 9 ways to choose A, since it can't be 0, and once A has been chosen there are 9 ways to choose B. Since there are $9\\cdot10\\cdot10=900$ total three digit numbers, and $9\\cdot9=81$ numbers which aren't valid, there are $900-81=\\boxed{819}$ valid numbers.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of three-digit numbers.\nTo find the total number of three-digit numbers, we consider that the first digit can be any number from 1 to 9 (since 0 cannot be the first digit), and the second and third digits can be any number from 0 to 9. This gives us 9 choices for the first digit and 10 choices for each of the second and third digits, resulting in a total of $9 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 900$ three-digit numbers.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the pattern to exclude.\nWe need to exclude all three-digit numbers where exactly two digits are the same, but these two digits are not adjacent. This means the first and third digits are the same, but different from the second digit.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of three-digit numbers to exclude.\nFor the numbers to exclude, the first and third digits must be the same (and not 0, since the first digit cannot be 0), giving us 9 choices for the first and third digits (1-9). The second digit must be different from the first and third, giving us 9 choices for the second digit (since it can be any digit from 0 to 9 except the one chosen for the first and third digits). This results in $9 \\times 9 = 81$ numbers to exclude.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of three-digit numbers left after exclusion.\nTo find the number of three-digit numbers left after excluding the ones with exactly two non-adjacent same digits, we subtract the number of excluded numbers from the total number of three-digit numbers. So, $900 - 81 = 819$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{819}$"
