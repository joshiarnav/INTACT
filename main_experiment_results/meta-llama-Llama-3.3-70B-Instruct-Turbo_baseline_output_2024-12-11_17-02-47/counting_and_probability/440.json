    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given constraints\nThe problem states that a point $(x,y)$ is randomly selected within the bounds $0 \\le x \\le 3$ and $0 \\le y \\le 6$. This defines a rectangle in the Cartesian plane with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, $(3,6)$, and $(0,6)$.\n\n## Step 2: Visualize the condition $x+y \\le 4$\nThe condition $x+y \\le 4$ describes a region in the plane. By rearranging the inequality, we get $y \\le -x + 4$. This is the equation of a line with a slope of $-1$ and a $y$-intercept at $(0,4)$. The region that satisfies the condition $x+y \\le 4$ is the area below or on this line.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the intersection points of the line $y = -x + 4$ with the rectangle\nTo find where the line $y = -x + 4$ intersects the boundary of the rectangle, we consider the edges of the rectangle. The line intersects the $x$-axis when $y = 0$, which gives $0 = -x + 4$, or $x = 4$. However, since $x$ is bounded by $0 \\le x \\le 3$, the intersection relevant to our area of interest is when $x = 3$, which gives $y = -3 + 4 = 1$. The line also intersects the $y$-axis at $y = 4$ when $x = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the region where $x+y \\le 4$\nThe region that satisfies $x+y \\le 4$ within the given rectangle is a trapezoid with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(0,4)$, $(3,1)$, and $(3,0)$. The area of a trapezoid is given by $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the parallel sides, and $h$ is the height (the distance between the parallel sides). In this case, $b_1 = 4$ (the length from $(0,0)$ to $(0,4)$), $b_2 = 1$ (the length from $(3,0)$ to $(3,1)$), and $h = 3$ (the distance from $x = 0$ to $x = 3$). Thus, the area of the trapezoid is $A = \\frac{1}{2}(4 + 1) \\cdot 3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 = \\frac{15}{2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total area of the rectangle\nThe total area of the rectangle defined by $0 \\le x \\le 3$ and $0 \\le y \\le 6$ is $A_{total} = 3 \\cdot 6 = 18$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability that $x+y \\le 4$\nThe probability that a randomly selected point $(x,y)$ satisfies $x+y \\le 4$ is the ratio of the area where $x+y \\le 4$ to the total area of the rectangle. Thus, the probability is $P = \\frac{A}{A_{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{15}{2}}{18} = \\frac{15}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{18} = \\frac{15}{36} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{12}}$"
