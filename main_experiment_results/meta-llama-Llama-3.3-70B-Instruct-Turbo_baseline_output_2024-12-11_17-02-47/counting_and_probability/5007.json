    "problem": "What is the largest $2$-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$?\n",
    "solution": "Expanding the binomial coefficient, we get ${200 \\choose 100}=\\frac{200!}{100!100!}$. Let the required prime be $p$; then $10 \\le p < 100$. If $p > 50$, then the factor of $p$ appears twice in the denominator. Thus, we need $p$ to appear as a factor at least three times in the numerator, so $3p<200$. The largest such prime is $\\boxed{61}$, which is our answer.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify what is being asked.\nWe are tasked with finding the largest 2-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$. This means we need to calculate the value of $n$ and then find its prime factors.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the value of $n = {200\\choose 100}$.\nThe formula for combinations, denoted as ${n\\choose k}$, is $\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Applying this formula, $n = \\frac{200!}{100!100!}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression for $n$ to make it easier to work with.\nWe can simplify $n$ by canceling out common factors in the numerator and denominator. This leaves us with $n = \\frac{200 \\times 199 \\times 198 \\times ... \\times 101}{100 \\times 99 \\times 98 \\times ... \\times 1}$.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the prime factors of $n$.\nTo find the prime factors, we look at the numerator and denominator of $n$. We know that $n$ will have prime factors from the numbers $200$ down to $101$, as the rest are canceled out by the denominator.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the largest 2-digit prime factor.\nLooking at the prime numbers between $10$ and $99$, we can check which of these divide $n$ without remainder. Given the nature of $n$, it's likely that several large 2-digit primes will be factors.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the prime factorization of $n$ to find the largest 2-digit prime factor.\nThe prime factorization of $n$ involves breaking down the numerator into its prime factors and then removing any factors that are also in the denominator. Since we're looking for the largest 2-digit prime factor, we focus on primes less than $100$.\n\n## Step 7: Recall or derive the largest 2-digit prime number.\nThe largest 2-digit prime number is $97$. If $97$ is a factor of any of the numbers in the numerator and not canceled out by the denominator, it could be the largest 2-digit prime factor of $n$.\n\n## Step 8: Confirm if $97$ is indeed a factor of $n$.\nGiven $n = {200\\choose 100}$, and knowing that $97$ is a prime number between $100$ and $200$, it will not be canceled out by the denominator. Thus, if $97$ is a factor of any number in the product series of the numerator, it will be a factor of $n$.\n\n## Step 9: Determine if $97$ is a factor of any number in the numerator.\nSince $97$ is a prime number and is itself between $100$ and $200$, it will be included in the product series of the numerator. Hence, $97$ is indeed a factor of $n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{97}$"
