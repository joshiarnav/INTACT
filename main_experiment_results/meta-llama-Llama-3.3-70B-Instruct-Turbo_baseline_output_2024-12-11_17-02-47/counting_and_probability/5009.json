    "problem": "Let $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ be the vertices of a regular tetrahedron each of whose edges measures 1 meter. A bug, starting from vertex $A$, observes the following rule: at each vertex it chooses one of the three edges meeting at that vertex, each edge being equally likely to be chosen, and crawls along that edge to the vertex at its opposite end. Let $p = \\frac n{729}$ be the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ when it has crawled exactly 7 meters. Find the value of $n$.\n",
    "solution": "Let $P(n)$ denote the probability that the bug is at $A$ after it has crawled $n$ meters. Since the bug can only be at vertex $A$ if it just left a vertex which is not $A$, we have $P(n + 1) = \\frac13 (1 - P(n))$. We also know $P(0) = 1$, so we can quickly compute $P(1)=0$, $P(2) = \\frac 13$, $P(3) = \\frac29$, $P(4) = \\frac7{27}$, $P(5) = \\frac{20}{81}$, $P(6) = \\frac{61}{243}$ and $P(7) = \\frac{182}{729}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{182}$. One can solve this recursion fairly easily to determine a closed-form expression for $P(n)$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem and understand the scenario\nWe have a regular tetrahedron with vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, and a bug starting from vertex $A$. The bug crawls along the edges of the tetrahedron, choosing one of the three edges at each vertex with equal probability. We need to find the probability that the bug is back at vertex $A$ after crawling exactly 7 meters.\n\n## Step 2: Establish a recursive relationship for the probability\nLet's denote $P(n)$ as the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ after crawling $n$ meters. We notice that for the bug to be at vertex $A$ after crawling $n$ meters, it must have just left a vertex that is not $A$. Thus, we have the recursive relationship $P(n + 1) = \\frac13 (1 - P(n))$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the initial condition for the recursion\nThe initial condition is $P(0) = 1$, as the bug starts at vertex $A$ with certainty.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the recursive relationship to find $P(1)$, $P(2)$, $P(3)$, $P(4)$, $P(5)$, $P(6)$, and $P(7)$\nUsing the recursive relationship $P(n + 1) = \\frac13 (1 - P(n))$, we can calculate the probabilities step by step:\n- $P(1) = 0$\n- $P(2) = \\frac13$\n- $P(3) = \\frac29$\n- $P(4) = \\frac7{27$\n- $P(5) = \\frac{20}{81}$\n- $P(6) = \\frac{61}{243}$\n- $P(7) = \\frac{182}{729}$\n\n## Step 5: Express the probability $p$ in the required format\nThe probability $p$ that the bug is at vertex $A$ after crawling exactly 7 meters is $\\frac{182}{729}$. Hence, $n = 182$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{182}$"
