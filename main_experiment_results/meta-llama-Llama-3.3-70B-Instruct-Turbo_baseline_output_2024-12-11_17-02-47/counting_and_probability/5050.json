    "solution": "Let the two disjoint subsets be $A$ and $B$, and let $C = S-(A+B)$. For each $i \\in S$, either $i \\in A$, $i \\in B$, or $i \\in C$. So there are $3^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ into disjoint $A$, $B$, and $C$.\nHowever, there are $2^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ such that $A = \\emptyset$ and $S = B+C$, and there are $2^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ such that $B = \\emptyset$ and $S = A+C$. But, the combination such that $A = B = \\emptyset$ and $S = C$ is counted twice.\nThus, there are $3^{10}-2\\cdot2^{10}+1$ ordered pairs of sets $(A,B)$. But since the question asks for the number of unordered sets $\\{ A,B \\}$, $n = \\frac{1}{2}(3^{10}-2\\cdot2^{10}+1) = 28501 \\equiv \\boxed{501} \\pmod{1000}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem and understand the concept of disjoint subsets.\nWe need to find the number of sets of two non-empty disjoint subsets of the set $\\mathcal{S} = \\lbrace1,2,3,\\ldots,10\\rbrace$. Disjoint subsets are sets that have no common elements.\n\n## Step 2: Choose two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ from $\\mathcal{S}$.\nFor every element $i \\in \\mathcal{S}$, there are $3$ choices: $i$ could be in $A$, in $B$, or in neither $A$ nor $B$. This can be represented as a ternary (base $3$) number, where each digit corresponds to the choice made for each element in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of possible combinations for the two disjoint subsets.\nSince there are $10$ elements in $\\mathcal{S}$ and $3$ choices for each element, there are $3^{10}$ possible combinations.\n\n## Step 4: Subtract the cases where either $A$ or $B$ is empty.\nHowever, we need to subtract the cases where either $A$ or $B$ is empty, as the problem specifies non-empty disjoint subsets. There are $2^{10}$ ways for $A$ to be empty (each element in $\\mathcal{S}$ can either be in $B$ or in neither), and similarly $2^{10}$ ways for $B$ to be empty. But we have subtracted the case where both $A$ and $B$ are empty twice, so we need to add $1$ back.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ordered pairs of sets $(A,B)$.\nThe number of ordered pairs of sets $(A,B)$ is $3^{10} - 2 \\cdot 2^{10} + 1$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of unordered sets $\\{A,B\\}$.\nSince the question asks for the number of unordered sets $\\{A,B\\}$, we need to divide the number of ordered pairs by $2$ to account for the fact that $(A,B)$ and $(B,A)$ are the same unordered set.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the final value of $n$.\nSo, $n = \\frac{1}{2}(3^{10} - 2 \\cdot 2^{10} + 1)$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the remainder obtained when $n$ is divided by $1000$.\nWe need to find the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$. This involves calculating $n \\mod 1000$.\n\n## Step 9: Perform the calculation of $n \\mod 1000$.\nLet's calculate $n = \\frac{1}{2}(3^{10} - 2 \\cdot 2^{10} + 1) \\mod 1000$.\n\n$3^{10} \\mod 1000 = 59049 \\mod 1000 = 49$,\n$2^{10} \\mod 1000 = 1024 \\mod 1000 = 24$,\n$2 \\cdot 2^{10} \\mod 1000 = 2 \\cdot 24 \\mod 1000 = 48$,\n$3^{10} - 2 \\cdot 2^{10} + 1 \\mod 1000 = 49 - 48 + 1 \\mod 1000 = 2$,\n$n \\mod 1000 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\mod 1000 = 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{501}$"
