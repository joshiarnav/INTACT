They fall into three categories: there are those which are entirely contained within a single face of the cube (whose sides are two edges and one face diagonal), those which lie in a plane perpendicular to one face of the cube (whose sides are one edge, one face diagonal and one space diagonal of the cube) and those which lie in a plane oblique to the edges of the cube, whose sides are three face diagonals of the cube.\nEach face of the cube contains ${4\\choose 3} = 4$ triangles of the first type, and there are $6$ faces, so there are $24$ triangles of the first type. Each of these is a right triangle with legs of length $1$, so each triangle of the first type has area $\\frac 12$.\nEach edge of the cube is a side of exactly $2$ of the triangles of the second type, and there are $12$ edges, so there are $24$ triangles of the second type. Each of these is a right triangle with legs of length $1$ and $\\sqrt 2$, so each triangle of the second type has area $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nEach vertex of the cube is associated with exactly one triangle of the third type (whose vertices are its three neighbors), and there are $8$ vertices of the cube, so there are $8$ triangles of the third type. Each of the these is an equilateral triangle with sides of length $\\sqrt 2$, so each triangle of the third type has area $\\frac{\\sqrt 3}2$.\nThus the total area of all these triangles is $24 \\cdot \\frac12 + 24\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt2}2 + 8\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt3}2 = 12 + 12\\sqrt2 + 4\\sqrt3 = 12 + \\sqrt{288} + \\sqrt{48}$ and the answer is $12 + 288 + 48 = \\boxed{348}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a $1$ by $1$ by $1$ cube, and we need to find the sum of the areas of all triangles whose vertices are also vertices of this cube. The sum is expressed as $m + \\sqrt{n} + \\sqrt{p}$, where $m, n,$ and $p$ are integers.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the vertices and triangles\nThe cube has $8$ vertices, and we can form triangles by choosing any $3$ of these vertices. We need to consider the different categories of triangles that can be formed, such as those contained within a single face of the cube, those lying in a plane perpendicular to one face of the cube, and those lying in a plane oblique to the edges of the cube.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the areas of triangles within a single face\nEach face of the cube contains ${4\\choose 3} = 4$ triangles of the first type, and since there are $6$ faces, there are $4 \\times 6 = 24$ triangles of this type. Each of these is a right triangle with legs of length $1$, yielding an area of $\\frac{1}{2}$ for each type.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the areas of triangles in a plane perpendicular to one face\nEach edge of the cube is associated with exactly $2$ triangles of the second type, and since there are $12$ edges, there are $12 \\times 2 = 24$ triangles of this type. Each of these also forms a right triangle, but with legs of length $1$ and $\\sqrt 2$, yielding an area of $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ for each type.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the areas of triangles in a plane oblique to the edges of the cube\nEach vertex of the cube is associated with exactly one triangle of the third type. Thus, there are $8$ triangles of this type. Each of these equilateral triangles has sides of length $\\sqrt 2$, so its area is $\\frac{\\sqrt 3}{2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the sum of areas of all triangles\nThe sum of the areas of all these triangles is $24 \\times \\frac{1}{2} + 24 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + 8 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 12 + 12\\sqrt2 + 4\\sqrt3 = 12 + \\sqrt{288} + \\sqrt{48}$.\n\n## Step 7: Express the sum in the required format\nThe sum of areas can be expressed as $m + \\sqrt{n} + \\sqrt{p}$, where $m = 12$, $n = 288$, and $p = 48$. Therefore, $m + n + p = 12 + 288 + 48 = 348$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{348}$"
