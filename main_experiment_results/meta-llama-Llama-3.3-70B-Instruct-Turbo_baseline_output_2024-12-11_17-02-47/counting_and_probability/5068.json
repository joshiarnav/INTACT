    "problem": "Seven teams play a soccer tournament in which each team plays every other team exactly once. No ties occur, each team has a $50\\%$ chance of winning each game it plays, and the outcomes of the games are independent. In each game, the winner is awarded a point and the loser gets 0 points. The total points are accumilated to decide the ranks of the teams. In the first game of the tournament, team $A$ beats team $B.$ The probability that team $A$ finishes with more points than team $B$ is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

    "solution": "The results of the five remaining games are independent of the first game, so by symmetry, the probability that $A$ scores higher than $B$ in these five games is equal to the probability that $B$ scores higher than $A$. We let this probability be $p$; then the probability that $A$ and $B$ end with the same score in these five games is $1-2p$.\nOf these three cases ($|A| > |B|, |A| < |B|, |A|=|B|$), the last is the easiest to calculate (see solution 2 for a way to directly calculate the other cases).\nThere are ${5\\choose k}$ ways to $A$ to have $k$ victories, and ${5\\choose k}$ ways for $B$ to have $k$ victories. Summing for all values of $k$,\n$1-2p = \\frac{1}{2^{5} \\times 2^{5}}\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{5} {5\\choose k}^2\\right) = \\frac{1^2+5^2+10^2+10^2+5^2+1^2}{1024} = \\frac{126}{512}.$\nThus $p = \\frac 12 \\left(1-\\frac{126}{512}\\right) = \\frac{193}{512}$. The desired probability is the sum of the cases when $|A| \\ge |B|$, so the answer is $\\frac{126}{512} + \\frac{193}{512} = \\frac{319}{512}$, and $m+n = \\boxed{831}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe problem describes a soccer tournament with seven teams, where each team plays every other team once. The outcomes are independent, with each team having a 50% chance of winning each game. The winner of each game receives a point, and the loser gets 0 points. The first game results in team A beating team B. We are tasked with finding the probability that team A finishes with more points than team B.\n\n## Step 2: Identifying Key Factors\nThere are a total of ${7 \\choose 2} = 21$ games played in the tournament. Team A and team B each play 5 other teams, and the results of these 10 games, along with the first game, will determine the final standings. The probability that A scores higher than B in these five games is equal to the probability that B scores higher than A, as the teams are symmetric in this regard. We also need to consider the probability that A and B end with the same score.\n\n## Step 3: Calculating Probabilities\nLet's denote the probability that A scores higher than B as $p$, the probability that B scores higher than A as $q$, and the probability that A and B end with the same score as $r$. Since the teams are symmetric, $p = q$. Additionally, we know that $p + q + r = 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Same Score Probability\nTo calculate $r$, we need to consider the cases where A and B have the same score. This can happen in the following ways: A and B both win $k$ games out of the remaining 5 games, where $k$ ranges from 0 to 5. The probability of each case can be calculated using combinations and the fact that each team has a 50% chance of winning each game.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating $r$\nThe probability $r$ can be calculated by summing the probabilities of all the cases where A and B have the same score. This involves calculating $\\sum_{k=0}^{5}\\binom{5}{k}^2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{10}$.\n\n## Step 6: Finding $p$\nAfter calculating $r$, we can use the fact that $p + q + r = 1$ and $p = q$ to solve for $p$. Since $p = q$, we have $2p + r = 1$, so $p = \\frac{1 - r}{2}$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculating $r$ Value\nWe calculate $r = \\sum_{k=0}^{5}\\binom{5}{k}^2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{10} = \\frac{1}{2^{10}}\\left(\\binom{5}{0}^2 + \\binom{5}{1}^2 + \\binom{5}{2}^2 + \\binom{5}{3}^2 + \\binom{5}{4}^2 + \\binom{5}{5}^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{2^{10}}\\left(1 + 25 + 100 + 100 + 25 + 1\\right) = \\frac{252}{2^{10}} = \\frac{63}{256}$.\n\n## Step 8: Finding $p$ Value\nUsing $r = \\frac{63}{256}$, we can find $p = \\frac{1 - r}{2} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{63}{256}}{2} = \\frac{193}{512}$.\n\n## Step 9: Final Probability and Answer\nThe probability that team A finishes with more points than team B is $p = \\frac{193}{512}$. Thus, the sum of the numerator and the denominator is $193 + 512 = 705$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{705}$"
