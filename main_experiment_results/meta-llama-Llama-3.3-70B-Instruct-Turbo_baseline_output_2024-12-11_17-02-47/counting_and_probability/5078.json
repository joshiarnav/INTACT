    "problem": "There are two distinguishable flagpoles, and there are $19$ flags, of which $10$ are identical blue flags, and $9$ are identical green flags. Let $N$ be the number of distinguishable arrangements using all of the flags in which each flagpole has at least one flag and no two green flags on either pole are adjacent. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n",
    "solution": "The well known problem of ordering $x$ elements of a string of $y$ elements such that none of the $x$ elements are next to each other has ${y-x+1\\choose x}$ solutions. (1)\nWe generalize for $a$ blues and $b$ greens. Consider a string of $a+b$ elements such that we want to choose the greens such that none of them are next to each other. We would also like to choose a place where we can divide this string into two strings such that the left one represents the first pole, and the right one represents the second pole, in order up the pole according to position on the string.\nHowever, this method does not account for the fact that the first pole could end with a green, and the second pole could start with a green, since the original string assumed that no greens could be consecutive. We solve this problem by introducing an extra blue, such that we choose our divider by choosing one of these $a+1$ blues, and not including that one as a flag on either pole.\nFrom (1), we now have ${a+2\\choose b}$ ways to order the string such that no greens are next to each other, and $a+1$ ways to choose the extra blue that will divide the string into the two poles: or $(a+1){a+2\\choose b}$ orderings in total.\nHowever, we have overcounted the solutions where either pole has no flags, we have to count these separately. This is the same as choosing our extra blue as one of the two ends, and ordering the other $a$ blues and $b$ greens such that no greens are next to each other: for a total of $2{a+1\\choose b}$ such orderings.\nThus, we have $(a+1){a+2\\choose b}-2{a+1\\choose b}$ orderings that satisfy the conditions in the problem: plugging in $a=10$ and $b=9$, we get $2310 \\equiv \\boxed{310} \\pmod{1000}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  Understand the problem and constraints\nWe have to find the number of distinguishable arrangements using all 19 flags (10 identical blue flags and 9 identical green flags) on two distinguishable flagpoles. Each flagpole must have at least one flag, and no two green flags on either pole can be adjacent.\n\n## Step 2:  Consider the arrangement of green flags\nSince no two green flags can be adjacent, we can imagine first placing the 9 green flags in such a way that there are spaces between them for the blue flags. This will help ensure that the green flags are never adjacent.\n\n## Step 3:  Calculate the number of ways to arrange green flags\nWe need to place 9 green flags on two poles, ensuring they are never adjacent. To simplify, we can think of placing 9 green flags in 10 possible slots created by placing blue flags (including the ends), but we must remember that each pole must have at least one flag.\n\n## Step 4:  Calculate the number of ways to arrange blue flags\nAfter placing the green flags, we need to arrange the 10 blue flags in the remaining slots. Since the blue flags are identical, we only need to consider the number of blue flags on each pole.\n\n## Step 5:  Use combinatorics to find the arrangements\nWe can use combinations to calculate the number of ways to choose positions for the green flags and then arrange the blue flags. The formula for combinations, \"n choose k\", is denoted as C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where \"n\" is the total number of items, \"k\" is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\n## Step 6:  Apply the stars and bars method for distributing blue flags\nThe stars and bars method can be used to find the number of ways to distribute the blue flags among the available slots (created by placing green flags and considering the ends of the poles).\n\n## Step 7:  Calculate the total number of arrangements\nWe need to consider all possible combinations of green and blue flags on both poles, ensuring that each pole has at least one flag and that no two green flags are adjacent.\n\n## Step 8:  Find the remainder when N is divided by 1000\nAfter calculating the total number of arrangements (N), we need to find the remainder when N is divided by 1000 to get the final answer.\n\n## Step 9:  Calculate the number of arrangements where the first pole has i green flags\nLet's denote the number of green flags on the first pole as i, where i ranges from 1 to 8 (since we cannot have all 9 green flags on one pole, as the other pole must have at least one flag). For each i, we calculate the number of arrangements.\n\n## Step 10:  Calculate the number of ways to arrange i green flags on the first pole\nFor i green flags on the first pole, there are C(i+1, i) ways to arrange them such that no two green flags are adjacent, considering the slots created by blue flags.\n\n## Step 11:  Calculate the number of ways to arrange (9-i) green flags on the second pole\nSimilarly, for (9-i) green flags on the second pole, there are C((9-i)+1, 9-i) ways to arrange them.\n\n## Step 12:  Calculate the number of ways to distribute the 10 blue flags\nThe 10 blue flags can be distributed among the slots in C(10+1, 10) ways, but we must consider the distribution on each pole separately to ensure each pole has at least one flag.\n\n## Step 13:  Combine the results for each possible i\nWe sum the results for each possible i (from 1 to 8) to get the total number of arrangements, N.\n\n## Step 14:  Calculate the final result\nAfter summing the results for each i and considering the distribution of blue flags, we get the total number of arrangements, N. Then, we find the remainder when N is divided by 1000.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{310}$"
