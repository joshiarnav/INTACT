    "problem": "A mother purchases 5 blue plates, 2 red plates, 2 green plates, and 1 orange plate. How many ways are there for her to arrange these plates for dinner around her circular table if she doesn't want the 2 green plates to be adjacent?\n",
    "solution": "We apply the complement principle: we find the total number of cases in which the 2 green places are adjacent, and subtract from the total number of cases.\nThere are $\\frac{10!}{5!2!2!1!} = 7560$ ways to arrange the plates in a linear fashion. However, since the plates are arranged in a circle, there are $10$ ways to rotate the plates, and so there are $7560/10 = 756$ ways to arrange the plates in a circular fashion (consider, for example, fixing the orange plate at the top of the table).\nIf the two green plates are adjacent, we may think of them as a single entity, so that there are now $9$ objects to be placed around the table in a circular fashion. Using the same argument, there are $\\frac{9!}{5!2!1!1!} = 1512$ ways to arrange the objects in a linear fashion, and $1512/9 = 168$ ways in a circular fashion.\nThus, the answer is $756 - 168 = \\boxed{588}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to arrange the plates in a linear fashion.\nTo find the total number of ways to arrange the plates in a linear fashion, we can use the formula for permutations of a multiset: $\\frac{n!}{n_1! \\cdot n_2! \\cdot ... \\cdot n_k!}$, where $n$ is the total number of objects and $n_1, n_2, ..., n_k$ are the counts of each distinct object. In this case, we have 10 plates in total, with 5 blue, 2 red, 2 green, and 1 orange. So, the total number of linear arrangements is $\\frac{10!}{5! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 1!} = \\frac{10!}{5! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 2!} = 7560$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of ways to arrange the plates in a circular fashion.\nFor circular arrangements, we divide the total number of linear arrangements by the number of plates, since each linear arrangement has $n$ equivalent circular arrangements. Therefore, the total number of circular arrangements is $\\frac{7560}{10} = 756$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the plates where the 2 green plates are adjacent.\nTo find the number of arrangements where the 2 green plates are adjacent, we can treat the 2 green plates as a single unit, resulting in 9 objects to arrange (5 blue, 2 red, 1 orange, and 1 green unit). The number of linear arrangements is $\\frac{9!}{5! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 1!} = \\frac{9!}{5! \\cdot 2!} = 1512$. Then, the number of circular arrangements with the green plates adjacent is $\\frac{1512}{9} = 168$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to arrange the plates where the 2 green plates are not adjacent.\nThe number of arrangements where the 2 green plates are not adjacent is the total number of circular arrangements minus the number of arrangements where the green plates are adjacent. So, $756 - 168 = 588$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{588}$"
