    "problem": "A paperboy delivers newspapers to 10 houses along Main Street. Wishing to save effort, he doesn't always deliver to every house, but to avoid being fired he never misses three consecutive houses. Compute the number of ways the paperboy could deliver papers in this manner.\n",
    "solution": "We can find a recursion. Let $D_n$ be the number of legal delivery sequences for $n$ houses. If a sequence ends with a delivery, we simply append one to $D_{n - 1}$. If it ends in $1$ nondelivery, we append a nondelivery and a delivery to $D_{n - 2}$. If it ends in $2$ nondeliveries, we append them and a delivery to $D_{n - 3}$. So\n$D_n = D_{n - 1} + D_{n - 2} + D_{n - 3}$.\nThus, since clearly $D_1 = 2$, $D_2 = 4$, $D_3 = 7$, we have $D_4 = 13$, $D_5 = 24$, $D_6 = 44$, $D_7 = 81$, $D_8 = 149$, $D_9 = 274$, $D_{10} = \\boxed{504}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem and understand the constraints\nThe paperboy needs to deliver newspapers to 10 houses along Main Street, with the constraint that he never misses three consecutive houses. This means he can choose to deliver or not deliver to each house, but he must deliver to at least one of every three consecutive houses.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the approach to solve the problem\nTo solve this, we can use a recursive approach or dynamic programming, considering the sequences of deliveries and non-deliveries. Let's denote $a_n$ as the number of ways to deliver papers to $n$ houses without missing three consecutive houses.\n\n## Step 3: Establish the base cases for recursion or dynamic programming\nFor 1 house, there are 2 ways (deliver or not). For 2 houses, there are $2^2 = 4$ ways (each house can be delivered or not, independently). For 3 houses, there are 7 ways because we must exclude the case where all three houses are missed (which violates the rule), from the $2^3 = 8$ total combinations.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the recursive relationship\nA sequence of $n$ houses can be formed from a sequence of $n-1$ houses by either delivering to the $n$th house (which can always be done) or not delivering to the $n$th house (in which case the $(n-1)$th and $(n-2)$th houses must have been delivered to, to avoid missing three consecutive houses). This leads to the relationship $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$, because we can append a delivery to any of the $a_{n-1}$ sequences, append a non-delivery to any of the $a_{n-2}$ sequences that end in a delivery (to ensure the last two houses aren't missed), and append a non-delivery to any of the $a_{n-3}$ sequences that end in two deliveries (to ensure the last three houses aren't missed).\n\n## Step 5: Apply the recursive relationship to find $a_{10}$\nGiven the base cases $a_1 = 2$, $a_2 = 4$, and $a_3 = 7$, we can calculate $a_4$, $a_5$, ..., up to $a_{10}$ using the recursive formula $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $a_4$ to $a_{10}$\n$a_4 = a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = 7 + 4 + 2 = 13$,\n$a_5 = a_4 + a_3 + a_2 = 13 + 7 + 4 = 24$,\n$a_6 = a_5 + a_4 + a_3 = 24 + 13 + 7 = 44$,\n$a_7 = a_6 + a_5 + a_4 = 44 + 24 + 13 = 81$,\n$a_8 = a_7 + a_6 + a_5 = 81 + 44 + 24 = 149$,\n$a_9 = a_8 + a_7 + a_6 = 149 + 81 + 44 = 274$,\n$a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 + a_7 = 274 + 149 + 81 = 504$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{504}$"
