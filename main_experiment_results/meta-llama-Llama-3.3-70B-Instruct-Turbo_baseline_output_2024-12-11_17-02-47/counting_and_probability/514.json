    "problem": "License plates from different states follow different alpha-numeric formats, which dictate which characters of a plate must be letters and which must be numbers. Florida has license plates with an alpha-numeric format like the one pictured. North Dakota, on the other hand, has a different format, also pictured. Assuming all 10 digits are equally likely to appear in the numeric positions, and all 26 letters are equally likely to appear in the alpha positions, how many more license plates can Florida issue than North Dakota?

    "solution": "Florida issues license plates in which the first three and last slots are filled with letters, and the fourth and fifth are filled with digits. Thus, there are $26^4 \\cdot 10^2$ Florida license plates possible. North Dakota, however, issues license plates in which the first three slots are filled with letters and the last three slots are filled with digits. There are thus $26^3 \\cdot 10^3$ possible North Dakota license plates. Multiplying these out and taking the difference yields an answer of $\\boxed{28121600}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the format for each state's license plate\nFlorida's license plate format is given as three letters, followed by two numbers, and then one letter (e.g., HJF 94K), while North Dakota's format is three letters, followed by three numbers (e.g., DGT 317).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of possible license plates for Florida\nFor Florida, there are 26 possibilities for each of the first three letters, 10 possibilities for each of the next two numbers, and 26 possibilities for the last letter. The total number of license plates Florida can issue is $26^3 \\times 10^2 \\times 26 = 26^4 \\times 10^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of possible license plates for North Dakota\nFor North Dakota, there are 26 possibilities for each of the first three letters, and 10 possibilities for each of the next three numbers. The total number of license plates North Dakota can issue is $26^3 \\times 10^3$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the difference in the number of license plates between Florida and North Dakota\nTo find out how many more license plates Florida can issue than North Dakota, we subtract the number of North Dakota's possible plates from the number of Florida's possible plates: $26^4 \\times 10^2 - 26^3 \\times 10^3$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression\nWe can factor out $26^3 \\times 10^2$ from both terms: $26^3 \\times 10^2 (26 - 10)$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final difference\n$26^3 = 17576$, $10^2 = 100$, and $26 - 10 = 16$. Therefore, the difference is $17576 \\times 100 \\times 16$.\n\n## Step 7: Perform the multiplication\n$17576 \\times 100 = 1757600$, and $1757600 \\times 16 = 28121600$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28121600}$"
