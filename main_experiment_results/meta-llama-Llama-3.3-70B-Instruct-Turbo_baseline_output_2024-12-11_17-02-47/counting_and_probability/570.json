    "problem": "If Greg rolls four fair six-sided dice, what is the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's?",
    "solution": "We notice that the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's must equal the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's. So, we can find the probability that Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's, subtract it from 1, and divide by 2 to find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's. There are three ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's: he can roll two of each, one of each, or none of each. If he rolls two of each, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which two dice roll the 1's. If he rolls one of each, there are $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1}=12$ ways to choose which dice are the 6 and the 1, and for each of those ways there are $4\\cdot4=16$ ways to choose the values of the other dice. If Greg rolls no 1's or 6's, there are $4^4=256$ possible values for the dice. In total, there are $6+12\\cdot16+256=454$ ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's. There are $6^4=1296$ total ways the four dice can roll, so the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\left(1-\\dfrac{454}{1296}\\right)=\\boxed{\\dfrac{421}{1296}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of outcomes when rolling four fair six-sided dice.\nWhen rolling four dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the total number of outcomes for four dice is $6^4 = 1296$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to roll the same number of 1's and 6's.\nTo find the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's, it's helpful to first calculate the probability of rolling the same number of 1's and 6's, and then use the complement rule along with the probability of rolling more 6's than 1's. The ways to roll the same number of 1's and 6's include rolling two of each, one of each, or none of each.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to roll two 1's and two 6's.\nThe number of ways to choose which two of the four dice will be 1's (and thus the other two will be 6's) is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$. For each of these ways, the remaining two dice can be any of the four other numbers (2, 3, 4, 5), so there are $4^2 = 16$ possibilities for the remaining dice. However, since we are specifically looking at the cases where we have exactly two 1's and two 6's, the calculation is simply $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ without the need for the $4^2$ factor, as the dice in question are already determined to be 1's and 6's.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to roll one 1 and one 6.\nThe number of ways to choose which die will be the 1 is $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$, and then there are $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways to choose which of the remaining dice will be the 6. The other two dice can be any of the four other numbers (2, 3, 4, 5), so there are $4^2 = 16$ possibilities for them. Thus, the total number of ways to roll one 1 and one 6 is $4 \\times 3 \\times 16 = 192$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to roll no 1's or 6's.\nFor each of the four dice, there are 4 possibilities (2, 3, 4, 5) since we're excluding 1's and 6's. Thus, the total number of ways to roll no 1's or 6's is $4^4 = 256$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of ways to roll the same number of 1's and 6's.\nAdding the results from steps 3, 4, and 5 gives us $6 + 192 + 256 = 454$ ways to roll the same number of 1's and 6's.\n\n## Step 7: Recognize that the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's is equal to the probability of rolling more 6's than 1's due to symmetry.\nSince the dice are fair and there's a symmetry between 1's and 6's, the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's is equal to the probability of rolling more 6's than 1's.\n\n## Step 8: Use the complement rule to find the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's.\nThe total probability of all outcomes is 1. The probability of rolling the same number of 1's and 6's is $\\frac{454}{1296}$. Since the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's is equal to the probability of rolling more 6's than 1's, let's denote this probability as $P$. Therefore, $P + P + \\frac{454}{1296} = 1$, because these cover all possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for $P$.\n$2P + \\frac{454}{1296} = 1$. Rearranging gives $2P = 1 - \\frac{454}{1296}$. Simplifying, $2P = \\frac{1296 - 454}{1296} = \\frac{842}{1296}$. Thus, $P = \\frac{842}{2 \\times 1296} = \\frac{421}{1296}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{421}{1296}}$"
