    "problem": "An integer greater than 9 and less than 100 is randomly chosen. What is the probability that its digits are different?",
    "solution": "We calculate the probability that the digits are the same, and subtract from 1. From the 90 integers to be chosen from, only 9 have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, ..., 99. Therefore, the probability that the digits are the same is $\\frac{9}{90} = \\frac{1}{10}$, so the probability that the digits are different is $1-\\frac{1}{10}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the total number of two-digit integers.\nThere are 90 two-digit integers in total, ranging from 10 to 99, since we are looking for integers greater than 9 and less than 100.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of two-digit integers where the digits are the same.\nThese are the numbers 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99, totaling 9 integers.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of two-digit integers where the digits are different.\nTo find this, we subtract the number of integers with the same digits from the total number of two-digit integers: 90 - 9 = 81.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that a randomly chosen two-digit integer has different digits.\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes (integers with different digits) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (total number of two-digit integers): probability = 81 / 90.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the fraction to express the probability in its simplest form.\nThe fraction 81 / 90 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9. Thus, 81 / 9 = 9 and 90 / 9 = 10, resulting in 9 / 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$"
