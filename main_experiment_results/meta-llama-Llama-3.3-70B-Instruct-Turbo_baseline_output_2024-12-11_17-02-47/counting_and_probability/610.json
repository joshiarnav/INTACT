    "problem": "Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards (13 hearts, 13 clubs, 13 spades, and 13 diamonds).  What is the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen?",
    "solution": "The probability that the first card is a 6 is $\\dfrac{1}{13}$.  There are then 51 cards remaining, so the probability the second card is a Queen is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  The answer is then $\\dfrac{1}{13} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{663}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing a 6 as the first card\nThe total number of cards in a standard deck is 52. There are 4 sixes in the deck (one for each suit: hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds). So, the probability of drawing a 6 as the first card is 4/52, which simplifies to 1/13.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing a Queen as the second card\nAfter the first card is drawn, there are 51 cards left in the deck. There are 4 Queens in the deck. So, the probability of drawing a Queen as the second card is 4/51.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the overall probability of both events happening\nTo find the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen, we multiply the probabilities of the two events. So, the overall probability is (1/13) * (4/51).\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the overall probability\n(1/13) * (4/51) = 4 / (13 * 51) = 4 / 663.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{663}}$"
