    "problem": "If I have a $4\\times 4$ chess board, in how many ways can I place four distinct pawns on the board such that each column and row of the board contains no more than one pawn?",
    "solution": "Because our chess board is $4 \\times 4$, there must be exactly one pawn in each column and each row. Consider the ways to place one pawn in each row. In the first row, there are four potential spots for a pawn. However, no matter where we place the pawn, it takes up one column. So, in the second row, there are only three potential spots for a pawn. Similarly, there are two spots in the third row and only one in the fourth. Thus, there are $4\\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 24$ ways in which we can place the pawns. Now, because each pawn is distinct, we have four possible pawns to place in the first slot, three in the second, two in the fourth, and one in the last. So there are $24$ possible orderings of the pawns. Our final answer is thus $24^2 = \\boxed{576}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to place the first pawn on the board.\nTo place the first pawn, we have a $4 \\times 4$ board, meaning there are $4 \\times 4 = 16$ possible squares on which to place the pawn.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to place the second pawn after the first pawn has been placed.\nAfter placing the first pawn, the row and column that pawn occupies are no longer available for subsequent pawns. This means for the second pawn, we have $3$ rows and $3$ columns available, resulting in $3 \\times 3 = 9$ possible squares.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to place the third pawn after the first two pawns have been placed.\nWith the first two pawns placed and their respective rows and columns restricted, we now have $2$ rows and $2$ columns available for the third pawn. Thus, there are $2 \\times 2 = 4$ possible squares for the third pawn.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to place the fourth pawn after the first three pawns have been placed.\nAfter the first three pawns are placed, only $1$ row and $1$ column remain unrestricted. This leaves us with $1 \\times 1 = 1$ possible square for the fourth pawn.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of ways to place the four distinct pawns on the board.\nTo find the total number of ways to place all four pawns, we multiply the number of ways to place each pawn in sequence: $16 \\times 9 \\times 4 \\times 1 = 576$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{576}$"
