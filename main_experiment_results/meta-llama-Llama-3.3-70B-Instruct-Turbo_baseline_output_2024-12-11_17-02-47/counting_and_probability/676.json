    "problem": "I have 10 distinguishable socks in my drawer: 4 white, 4 brown, and 2 blue.  In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of the same color?",
    "solution": "The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue.  If the socks are white, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are brown, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are blue, there is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ choice.  So the total number of choices for socks is $6 + 6 + 1 = \\boxed{13}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the types of socks and their quantities.\nThere are 3 types of socks: white, brown, and blue, with quantities 4, 4, and 2 respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of socks for each color.\nFor white socks, the number of ways to choose a pair is given by the combination formula $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $k$ is the number of items to choose, and $!$ denotes factorial. So, for white socks, we have $C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\cdot 2} = 6$ ways.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of brown socks.\nUsing the same combination formula, for brown socks, we have $C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\cdot 2} = 6$ ways.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of blue socks.\nUsing the same combination formula, for blue socks, we have $C(2, 2) = \\frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = \\frac{2}{2 \\cdot 1} = 1$ way.\n\n## Step 5: Sum the number of ways to choose a pair of socks for each color to get the total number of ways.\nTotal number of ways = ways to choose white + ways to choose brown + ways to choose blue = $6 + 6 + 1 = 13$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$"
