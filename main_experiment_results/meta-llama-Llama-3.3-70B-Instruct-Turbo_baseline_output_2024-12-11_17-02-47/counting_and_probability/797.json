    "problem": "A math conference is presenting a lecture series with six different lecturers. If Dr. Smith's lecture depends on Dr. Jones's lecture, so that Dr. Smith must be scheduled at some time after Dr. Jones, in how many orders can the six lecturers be scheduled?",
    "solution": "There are a total of $6!$ ways to order the 6 lectures with no restriction. By symmetry, exactly half of these will have Dr. Jones's lecture before Dr. Smith's lecture. Thus there are $6!/2 = \\boxed{360}$ ways to schedule the conference.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Total number of lecturers\nThere are 6 different lecturers that need to be scheduled.\n\n## Step 2: Total possible orders without restrictions\nTo find the total number of ways to schedule the lecturers without any restrictions, we calculate the factorial of the total number of lecturers. This is because for the first position, we have 6 choices, for the second position, we have 5 choices (since one lecturer has already been scheduled), and so on, until we have only 1 choice for the last position. So, the total possible orders without restrictions are 6! (6 factorial).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate 6 factorial\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n\n## Step 4: Accounting for the restriction\nSince Dr. Smith's lecture must be scheduled after Dr. Jones's lecture, exactly half of the total possible orders will meet this criterion. This is because for every valid order where Dr. Jones lectures before Dr. Smith, there is an equivalent invalid order where Dr. Smith lectures before Dr. Jones.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the final number of valid orders\nTo find the number of valid orders, we divide the total possible orders by 2. valid_orders = 720 / 2 = 360.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{360}$"
