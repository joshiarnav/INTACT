    "problem": "I have a drawer with 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives in it. If I reach in and randomly remove three pieces of silverware, what is the probability that I get one fork, one spoon, and one knife?",
    "solution": "First, we can find the denominator of our fraction.  There are a total of $\\dbinom{18}{3}=816$ ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware out of 18.  To find the numerator, we need to count the number of ways to choose one piece of each type of silverware.  There are 6 ways we could choose a fork, 6 ways to choose a spoon, and 6 ways to choose a knife, making a total of $6\\cdot 6 \\cdot 6=216$ ways to choose a fork, a knife, and a spoon so our final probability is $\\frac{216}{816}=\\boxed{\\frac{9}{34}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware from 18\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware out of 18 can be calculated using the combination formula: $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Here, $n = 18$ (total pieces of silverware) and $k = 3$ (pieces to be chosen). So, $C(18, 3) = \\frac{18!}{3!(18-3)!} = \\frac{18 \\times 17 \\times 16}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 816$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 1 fork, 1 spoon, and 1 knife\nThere are 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives. The number of ways to choose 1 fork, 1 spoon, and 1 knife is calculated by multiplying the number of ways to choose each one: $C(6, 1) \\times C(6, 1) \\times C(6, 1) = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of choosing 1 fork, 1 spoon, and 1 knife\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes (choosing 1 fork, 1 spoon, and 1 knife) divided by the total number of outcomes (choosing any 3 pieces of silverware). So, the probability is $\\frac{216}{816}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the fraction\nSimplify the fraction $\\frac{216}{816}$ by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 216 and 816. The GCD of 216 and 816 is 24. Divide both numerator and denominator by 24: $\\frac{216 \\div 24}{816 \\div 24} = \\frac{9}{34}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{34}}$"
