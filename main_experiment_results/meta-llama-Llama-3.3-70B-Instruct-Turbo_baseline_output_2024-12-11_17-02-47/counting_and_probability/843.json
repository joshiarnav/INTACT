    "problem": "A bag contains 3 tan, 2 pink and 4 violet chips. If the 9 chips are randomly drawn from the bag, one at a time and without replacement, what is the probability that the chips are drawn in such a way that the 3 tan chips are drawn consecutively, the 2 pink chips are drawn consecutively, and the 4 violet chips are drawn consecutively, but not necessarily in the tan-pink-violet order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We count the number of ways to draw the tan chips consecutively, the pink chips consecutively, and the violet chips consecutively (although not necessarily in that order).  First of all, we can draw the tan chips in $3!$ ways, the pink chips in $2!$ ways, and the violet chips in $4!$ ways.  We can choose our drawing order (e.g pink-tan-violet) in $3!$ ways.  Thus we have $3!2!4!3!$ satisfying arrangements and $9!$ total ways of drawing the chips.  So our answer is $\\frac{3!2!4!3!}{9!} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{210}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Count the total number of ways to draw 9 chips from the bag without replacement.\nThe total number of ways to draw 9 chips from the bag without replacement is 9!.\n\n## Step 2: Count the number of ways to draw the 3 tan chips, 2 pink chips, and 4 violet chips consecutively.\nWe can consider the 3 tan chips as one block, the 2 pink chips as one block, and the 4 violet chips as one block. Then we have 3 blocks to arrange, which can be done in 3! ways.\n\n## Step 3: Within each block, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the chips.\nFor the 3 tan chips, they can be arranged in 3! ways. For the 2 pink chips, they can be arranged in 2! ways. For the 4 violet chips, they can be arranged in 4! ways.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways to draw the chips consecutively.\nThe total number of ways to draw the chips consecutively is 3! * 3! * 2! * 4!.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that the chips are drawn in such a way that the 3 tan chips are drawn consecutively, the 2 pink chips are drawn consecutively, and the 4 violet chips are drawn consecutively.\nThe probability is (3! * 3! * 2! * 4!) / 9!.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the probability fraction.\nWe can simplify the fraction by cancelling out common factors in the numerator and denominator.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the final probability fraction.\n3! * 3! * 2! * 4! = 6 * 6 * 2 * 24 = 1728.\n9! = 362880.\nSo, the probability is 1728 / 362880 = 1/210.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{210}}$"
