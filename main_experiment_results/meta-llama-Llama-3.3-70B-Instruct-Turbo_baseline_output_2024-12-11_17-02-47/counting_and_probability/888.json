    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem presents a tessellation, which is a repeating pattern of shapes that fit together without overlapping. We're tasked with determining the least number of colors needed to shade this tessellation such that no two tiles sharing a side have the same color.\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we can start by examining the structure of the tessellation. It's composed of hexagonal tiles arranged in a repeating pattern. We need to consider the minimum number of colors required to ensure that no adjacent tiles share the same color.\n## Step 3:  Looking at the tessellation, we notice that each tile shares sides with six neighboring tiles. This means that each tile must be colored differently from its six surrounding tiles.\n## Step 4:  A common strategy for solving problems like this is to look for a pattern or arrangement that allows for the minimum number of colors to be used. In this case, we can observe that the tessellation resembles a chessboard, where each tile is surrounded by tiles of the opposite color.\n## Step 5:  By alternating between two colors for each tile, we can ensure that no two adjacent tiles share the same color. This is similar to the classic chessboard coloring, where black and white squares alternate.\n## Step 6:  Based on this observation, it's clear that we only need $\\boxed{2}$ colors to shade the tessellation, as each tile can be colored with one of two colors, ensuring that no adjacent tiles have the same color.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
