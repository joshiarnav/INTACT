    "problem": "If I roll 5 standard 6-sided dice and multiply the number on the face of each die, what is the probability that the result is a composite number?",
    "solution": "While it is almost tempting to make this into the casework problem to end all casework problems, using complementary probability makes the problem a lot simpler, so we will find the probability that the product is not composite.\n\nIt's clear that if more than one die shows a roll greater than 1, the resulting product will have more than one factor that is greater than 1 and therefore be composite. Additionally, if any of the dice show a 4 or a 6, the product will obviously be composite. So in order for the product to not be composite, we need at least four dice to be a 1 and the fifth die to either be another 1 or a 2, a 3, or a 5.\n\nThere's exactly one way in which all the the dice can be 1's, and for each of the other three cases there are 5 ways since the die that isn't a 1 can appear in any of the 5 other positions, so there are a total of $3\\cdot5+1=16$ ways of rolling the dice that result in a product that isn't composite. Additionally, there are 6 options for the roll of each of the 5 dice for a total of $6^5=7776$ possible outcomes, which means that the probability of the product not being composite is $\\dfrac{16}{7776}$ and the probability that it is composite is $1-\\frac{16}{7776}=\\frac{7760}{7776}=\\boxed{\\frac{485}{486}}$.\n\nNote: Many students have tried to argue that 1 is not a prime number and should not be counted. As we are doing complementary probability, it is important to consider all numbers that are not composite, and 1 is definitely not composite.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define what a composite number is\nA composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. Conversely, a prime number has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the total number of outcomes when rolling 5 dice\nEach die has 6 possible outcomes, so the total number of outcomes for 5 dice is $6^5 = 7776$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the cases where the product is not composite\nTo find the probability that the product is composite, it's easier to first calculate the probability that the product is not composite and then subtract that from 1. The product will not be composite if at least four dice show a 1, and the fifth die shows either a 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to get a non-composite product\n- If all five dice show a 1, there's exactly 1 way this can happen.\n- For each of the other three cases (where four dice show a 1 and the last die shows a 2, 3, or 5), there are 5 ways since the non-1 die can appear in any of the 5 positions. So, that gives us $3 \\times 5 = 15$ ways.\n- Adding these together, we get $1 + 15 = 16$ ways to roll the dice such that the product is not composite.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of getting a composite number\nThe probability of the product not being composite is $16 / 7776$. Therefore, the probability that the product is composite is $1 - (16 / 7776)$.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the calculation\n$1 - (16 / 7776) = (7776 - 16) / 7776 = 7760 / 7776$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction if necessary\nThe fraction $7760 / 7776$ can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 16. This gives us $485 / 486$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{485}{486}}$"
