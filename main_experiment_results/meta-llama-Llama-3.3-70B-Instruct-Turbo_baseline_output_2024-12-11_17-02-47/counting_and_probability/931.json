    "problem": "When two fair 6-sided dice are tossed, the numbers $a$ and $b$ are obtained. What is the probability that the two digit number $ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) and $a$ and $b$ are all divisible by 3?",
    "solution": "$ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) is divisible by 3 only when $a+b$ is divisible by 3. Since 3 divides both $a$ and $a+b$, 3 must divide $b$. Therefore, $a$ and $b$ can equal 3 or 6. The probability that $a$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. The probability that $b$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. Therefore, The probability that both $a$ and $b$ equal 3 or 6 is $\\left(\\frac13\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac19}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the possible outcomes when two dice are tossed.\nWhen two dice are tossed, each die can result in a number from 1 to 6. So, for two dice, the total possible outcomes are 6 * 6 = 36.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the favorable outcomes where both digits are divisible by 3.\nFor a two-digit number $ab$ to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Additionally, since both $a$ and $b$ must be divisible by 3, the possible values for $a$ and $b$ are 3 and 6.\n\n## Step 3: Enumerate the favorable outcomes.\nGiven the constraint that both $a$ and $b$ must be divisible by 3, the favorable outcomes are (3,3), (3,6), (6,3), and (6,6).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of the favorable outcomes.\nThe probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. There are 4 favorable outcomes.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability.\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes = 4 / 36 = 1 / 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$"
