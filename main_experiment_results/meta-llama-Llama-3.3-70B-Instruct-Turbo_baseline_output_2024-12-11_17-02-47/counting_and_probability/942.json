    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 14, 15, 16 \\}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the range of possible differences\nThe maximum positive difference that can be obtained is $16 - 1 = 15$, and the minimum positive difference is $2 - 1 = 1$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify all possible differences\nAny integer from 1 to 15 can be obtained as a difference of two distinct members of the set. For example, $1 = 2 - 1$, $2 = 3 - 1$, and so on, up to $15 = 16 - 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Count the number of different positive integers\nSince all integers from 1 to 15 can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set, the total number of different positive integers is equal to 15.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
