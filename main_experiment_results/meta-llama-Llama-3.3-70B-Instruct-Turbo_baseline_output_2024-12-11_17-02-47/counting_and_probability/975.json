    "solution": "The hexagons in the second column to the left must be yellow and green, but either color can be on top: 2 possibilities. With either possibility, the rest of the figure is easily colored in, with the color of every other hexagon being forced.  (ex. In the third column, the middle hexagon must be red, and the top and bottom must be the opposite of the top and bottom in the second column)  Thus, there are only $\\boxed{2}$ possibilities.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem\nThe problem states that each hexagon is colored either red, yellow, or green, such that no two hexagons with a common side are colored the same color. We are given that the hexagon with the label \"R\" is colored red.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the possible colors for the adjacent hexagons\nSince the hexagon with the label \"R\" is colored red, the two hexagons adjacent to it can only be colored with the remaining two colors, which are yellow and green.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the possible color combinations for the adjacent hexagons\nThere are two possible color combinations for the two hexagons adjacent to the red hexagon: (1) yellow and green, or (2) green and yellow.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the possible colors for the next layer of hexagons\nOnce the colors of the two hexagons adjacent to the red hexagon are determined, the colors of the next layer of hexagons can be determined. The hexagons in this layer can only be colored with the remaining color that is not used by the adjacent hexagons.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the total number of possible color combinations\nSince there are two possible color combinations for the adjacent hexagons, and the colors of the remaining hexagons are determined by these combinations, there are two possible ways to color the entire figure.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
