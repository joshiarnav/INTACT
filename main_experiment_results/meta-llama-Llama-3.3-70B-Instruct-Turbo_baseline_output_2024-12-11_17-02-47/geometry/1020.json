    "problem": "In a trapezoid $ABCD$ with $AB$ parallel to $CD$, the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$. If the area of triangle $ABE$ is 50 square units, and the area of triangle $ADE$ is 20 square units, what is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?",
    "solution": "[asy]\nsize(2.5inch);\npair A,B,C,D,E;\nA = (-3,4);\nB = (5,4);\nC = (4,0);\nD = (0,0);\nE = intersectionpoint(A--C, B--D);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle); draw(A--C); draw(B--D);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW); label(\"$B$\", B, NE); label(\"$C$\", C, SE); label(\"$D$\", D, SW); label(\"$E$\", E, N);\n[/asy] We will write the area of triangle $XYZ$ as $[XYZ].$  Since triangles $ADC$ and $BCD$ share a base and have the same altitude length to that base, they have the same area. Since $[BCD] = [ADC]$, we have $[BCE] + [CDE] = [ADE] + [CDE]$, so  $[BCE] = [ADE] = 20$.\n\nTo find the area of triangle $CDE$, we note that triangles $CDE$ and $ABE$ are similar, and the ratio of their sides is $DE/BE$. Triangles $ADE$ and $ABE$ share an altitude, so $DE/BE = [ADE]/[ABE] = 20/50 = 2/5$. Since the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their sides, $[CDE]/[ABE] = (DE/BE)^2 = 4/25$, and $[CDE] = (4/25)[ABE] = (4/25)(50) = 8$. Thus, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $[ABE] + [ADE] + [BCE] + [CDE] = 50+20+20+8 = \\boxed{98}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the formula for the area of a triangle\nThe area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: Area = (base * height) / 2.\n\n## Step 2: Establish the relationship between the areas of triangles ABE and ADE\nGiven that the area of triangle ABE is 50 square units and the area of triangle ADE is 20 square units, we notice that these two triangles share the same height, which is the perpendicular distance from point E to line AD.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the ratio of the bases of triangles ABE and ADE\nSince the areas of triangles ABE and ADE are given as 50 and 20 square units respectively, and they share the same height, the ratio of their bases (AB and AD) is equal to the ratio of their areas. This implies that AB:AD = 50:20 = 5:2.\n\n## Step 4: Recall the properties of trapezoids\nIn a trapezoid, the line that connects the midpoints of the legs (here, the line connecting the midpoints of AD and BC) is parallel to the bases and is equal in length to the average of the lengths of the bases.\n\n## Step 5: Understand the relationship between triangles ABE, ADE, and the entire trapezoid ABCD\nTriangles ABE and ADE together form triangle ABD, which is half of the trapezoid when divided along one of its diagonals. Knowing the areas of triangles ABE and ADE allows us to calculate the area of triangle ABD.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the area of triangle ABD\nThe area of triangle ABD is the sum of the areas of triangles ABE and ADE, which is 50 + 20 = 70 square units.\n\n## Step 7: Use the ratio of the bases to find the area of triangle BCD\nSince AB:CD = 5:2 (from the given areas of triangles ABE and ADE), and knowing that the height of both triangles ABD and BCD is the same (because AB is parallel to CD), the ratio of the areas of triangles ABD and BCD will also be 5:2.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the area of triangle BCD\nLet's assume the area of triangle BCD is 2x. Then the area of triangle ABD would be 5x/2 * 2 = 5x, because the ratio of their areas is 5:2. We already know the area of ABD is 70 square units. So, 5x = 70, x = 14. This means the area of triangle BCD is 2x = 2 * 14 = 28 square units.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the area of trapezoid ABCD\nThe area of trapezoid ABCD is the sum of the areas of triangles ABD and BCD. Since we've calculated the area of ABD as 70 square units and the area of BCD as 28 * (5/2) = 70 square units (because triangle BCD's area must be in the same ratio to ABD as the bases are), we realize the mistake in calculating BCD's area directly from the ratio without considering the actual given areas. The correct approach to finding the area of BCD should utilize the fact that triangles ABE and ADE share a height with ABD, and thus the total area of ABD is given. The ratio of areas between ABE and ADE directly translates to the sides because they share a common vertex and base line (AD), implying the ratio of AB to AD (or CD, considering parallel lines and similar triangles) is indeed reflective of the areas of triangles sharing the same height. Given the areas of ABE and ADE, and their sum making ABD, to find BCD's area correctly, recognize that triangles CDE and BCD would be in a similar ratio as ABE and ADE due to parallel lines and shared angles, thus making the areas of triangles BCD and ABD in a similar ratio as their bases. However, the direct calculation of BCD from given data requires understanding that the total area of the trapezoid can also be approached by considering the areas of triangles ABE, ADE, and their relation to the entire figure.\n\n## Step 10: Correctly calculate the area of trapezoid ABCD\nRecognizing the error in the previous step's calculation for triangle BCD's area, we should instead directly utilize the given areas and the properties of trapezoids. The areas of triangles ABE and ADE provide insight into the ratio of the lengths of AB and AD (or CD), which is crucial for understanding the trapezoid's geometry. However, the calculation of the trapezoid's total area can be more straightforward: considering the heights and bases of triangles ABE and ADE, and recognizing that these triangles are parts of the larger triangles ABD and BCD, which make up the trapezoid. The correct approach involves understanding the proportional relationship between the areas of triangles and the lengths of their bases when they share a common height. Given that the ratio of the areas of triangles ABE and ADE is 5:2, this directly relates to the ratio of AB to AD. But to find the total area of the trapezoid, we must consider the areas of triangles ABD and BCD together, recognizing that the given areas already provide a significant portion of the information needed to calculate the total area.\n\n## Step 11: Final calculation for the area of trapezoid ABCD\nGiven that triangles ABE and ADE have areas of 50 and 20 square units, respectively, and together form triangle ABD with an area of 70 square units, and knowing the ratio of the bases AB to CD is 5:2, we can infer the area of triangle BCD by understanding that the heights of triangles ABD and BCD are the same (due to parallel bases in the trapezoid). If the area of ABD (which includes both ABE and ADE) is 70 square units, and considering the ratio of areas and bases, the total area of the trapezoid can be found by recognizing the proportional relationship between the areas of the triangles and the lengths of their bases. However, the direct path to the solution involves recognizing that the area of triangle ABD is given, and using the properties of trapezoids and the given ratio, we can find the area of BCD and thus the total area of ABCD.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{98}$"
