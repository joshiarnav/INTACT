    "problem": "A triangle with side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5 is inscribed in a circle of radius 3.  What is the area of the triangle? Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $3x$, $4x$, and $5x$.  The triangle is a right triangle, so its hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle.  Thus $5x=2\\cdot 3=6$, so $x=6/5$.  The area of the triangle is \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3x\\cdot 4x =\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{18}{5}\\cdot \\frac{24}{5}\n=\\frac{216}{25}=\\boxed{8.64}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the nature of the triangle\nThe triangle in question has side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5, which is a classic example of a right-angled triangle, as it satisfies the Pythagorean theorem (3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2).\n\n## Step 2: Find the actual side lengths of the triangle\nGiven that the triangle is inscribed in a circle of radius 3, and knowing the ratio of the sides, we need to find the actual lengths. Since the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle, corresponding to the ratio 5) is also the diameter of the circle (due to the inscribed right triangle properties), its length is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is twice the radius, so 2 * 3 = 6 units.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the multiplier for the side lengths\nTo find the actual lengths of the sides, we need to determine the multiplier used to scale the ratio 3:4:5 to the actual side lengths. Since the hypotenuse is 6 units and it corresponds to the ratio 5, the multiplier is 6 / 5.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the actual lengths of the sides\nUsing the multiplier found (6 / 5), we can calculate the lengths of the other two sides:\n- The side corresponding to the ratio 3 has a length of (3 * 6) / 5.\n- The side corresponding to the ratio 4 has a length of (4 * 6) / 5.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the area of the triangle\nThe area of a right-angled triangle can be found using the formula: Area = 1/2 * base * height, where the base and height are the two sides that form the right angle. In this case, the sides corresponding to the ratios 3 and 4 are the base and height.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the calculations for the side lengths\n- The length of the side corresponding to ratio 3 is (3 * 6) / 5 = 18 / 5 = 3.6.\n- The length of the side corresponding to ratio 4 is (4 * 6) / 5 = 24 / 5 = 4.8.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the area using the actual side lengths\nArea = 1/2 * 3.6 * 4.8 = 1/2 * 17.28 = 8.64.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8.64}$"
