    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ has vertices with coordinates $A(2,3),$ $B(7,8),$ and $C(-4,6)$. The triangle is reflected about line $L$. The image points are $A'(2,-5),$ $B'(7,-10),$ and $C'(-4,-8)$. What is the equation of line $L$?",
    "solution": "Since only the $y$ portions of the coordinates move, we know that the line of reflection must be a horizontal line. Now we just need to find the midpoint between an original point and its reflected image to pinpoint the location of the line. The $y$-coordinate of point $A$ is 3 and the $y$-coordinate of $A'$ is $-5$; therefore, the midpoint is at $(2, -1)$. The line of refection is $\\boxed{y = -1}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the midpoint of the line segments joining each point to its image\nTo find the equation of line $L$, we first need to find the midpoint of the line segments joining each point to its image. The midpoint formula is given by $(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$. For points $A(2,3)$ and $A'(2,-5)$, the midpoint is $(\\frac{2+2}{2}, \\frac{3-5}{2}) = (2, -1)$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the midpoint of the line segments joining point B to its image\nUsing the same midpoint formula for points $B(7,8)$ and $B'(7,-10)$, the midpoint is $(\\frac{7+7}{2}, \\frac{8-10}{2}) = (7, -1)$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the midpoint of the line segments joining point C to its image\nUsing the same midpoint formula for points $C(-4,6)$ and $C'(-4,-8)$, the midpoint is $(\\frac{-4-4}{2}, \\frac{6-8}{2}) = (-4, -1)$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the equation of line $L$\nSince all the midpoints have the same $y$-coordinate, $-1$, line $L$ is a horizontal line passing through $y = -1$. The equation of a horizontal line is given by $y = c$, where $c$ is the $y$-coordinate of any point on the line.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{y = -1}$"
