    "solution": "We start by drawing a diagram.  When the paper is folded, sides $AD$ and $CD$ coincide on the longer dashed line, and points $A$ and $C$ meet at $G$, as you can see below.  [asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(1,.4)); draw((0,0)--(.4,1));\ndraw((1,.4)--(.4,1),dashed);\ndraw((0,0)--(.7,.7),dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,1), NW); label(\"$B$\",(1,1), NE); label(\"$C$\",(1,0), SE); label(\"$D$\",(0,0), SW);\nlabel(\"$F$\",(1,.4), E); label(\"$E$\",(.4,1), N);\nlabel(\"$G$\",(.7,.7), NE);\n[/asy] Now, we assign variables.  We are looking for the length of $AE$, so let $AE=x$.  Then, $BE=1-x$.  Because of the symmetry of the square and the fold, everything to the left of line $BD$ is a mirror image of everything to the right of $BD$.  Thus, $\\triangle BEF$ is an isosceles right triangle (45-45-90), so $EF=\\sqrt{2}EB = \\sqrt{2}(1-x)$.  Also, $\\triangle EGB$ and $\\triangle FGB$ are congruent 45-45-90 triangles, so $GB = \\frac{EB}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nAlso, notice that because the way the paper is folded (its original position versus its final position), we have more congruent triangles, $\\triangle AED \\cong \\triangle GED$.  This means that $AD=GD=1$.\n\nLastly, notice that since $G$ is on $BD$, we have $BD=BG+GD$. $BD$ is a diagonal of the square, so it has side length $\\sqrt{2}$, $GD=1$, and $GB = \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}$.  Thus, our equation becomes \\[\\sqrt{2} = 1 + \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}.\\] Multiplying both sides by $\\sqrt{2}$ yields $2=\\sqrt{2}+1-x$; solving for $x$ yields $x=\\sqrt{2}-1$.  Thus, $AE=\\sqrt{2}-1=\\sqrt{k}-m$, and we see that $k+m=2+1=\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the given conditions\nWe are given a square $ABCD$ with side length $1$ unit. Points $E$ and $F$ are on sides $AB$ and $CB$ respectively, with $AE = CF$. When the square is folded along the lines $DE$ and $DF$, sides $AD$ and $CD$ coincide and lie on diagonal $BD$. We need to find the length of segment $AE$ and express it in the form $\\sqrt{k}-m$ units.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the situation after folding the square\nAfter folding the square, $AD$ and $CD$ coincide and lie on diagonal $BD$. Let's denote $AE = CF = x$. Then, $BE = BF = 1 - x$. Since $ABCD$ is a square, angle $FDE$ is a right angle.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $FDE$\nConsidering triangle $FDE$, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem: $FD^2 + DE^2 = FE^2$. Since $FD = DE$, we have $FD = DE = \\sqrt{2}x$. Also, $FE = 1 - x + x = 1$ (as $AE = CF = x$). However, this would not be correct as $FE$ should be $1$ when $x = 0$, so let's analyze this further.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the relationship between $x$ and the side lengths of the triangle $FDE$\nWhen $x = 0$, $FE = 1$ and $FD = DE = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot 0 = 0$. However, when $x$ increases, $FE$ becomes less than $1$. Let's consider the triangle $FDE$ when $x$ is not equal to $0$. As $FD = DE$, triangle $FDE$ is an isosceles right triangle.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $FDE$ with the correct understanding of $FE$\nWe should find the relationship between $x$ and the lengths of $FD$, $DE$, and $FE$. Since $AE = x$ and $AB = 1$, $BE = 1 - x$. Similarly, $CF = x$ and $CB = 1$, so $BF = 1 - x$. As triangle $FDE$ is a right triangle, $FE^2 = FD^2 + DE^2$. Considering $FD = DE = \\sqrt{2}x$ is incorrect, we need to correctly determine $FD$ and $DE$.\n\n## Step 6: Correctly determine the lengths of $FD$ and $DE$\nLet's analyze triangle $BDE$. Since $ABCD$ is a square, angle $BDE$ is $45^\\circ$. Thus, triangle $BDE$ is an isosceles right triangle. If $BE = 1 - x$, then $DE = BD - BE = \\sqrt{2} - (1 - x)$. However, we need to express $DE$ and $DF$ in terms of $x$.\n\n## Step 7: Express $DE$ and $DF$ in terms of $x$\nFrom the condition that $AD$ and $CD$ coincide when folded, we can derive the relationship between $x$ and the side lengths. As $AE = CF = x$ and $AB = 1$, $BE = 1 - x$. Since triangle $BDE$ is a right triangle and $DE = DF$, $DE = DF = \\sqrt{2} - 1 + x$ is not correct. We should find the correct expressions for $DE$ and $DF$.\n\n## Step 8: Find the correct expressions for $DE$ and $DF$\nConsidering triangle $ADE$, $DE = \\sqrt{1 + x^2}$ and $DF = \\sqrt{1 + (1 - x)^2}$. However, this is still not correct. Let's consider the condition $AE = CF = x$ and the fact that $AD$ and $CD$ coincide when folded.\n\n## Step 9: Apply the condition that $AD$ and $CD$ coincide when folded\nWhen $AD$ and $CD$ coincide, $DF = 1 - x$ and $DE = x$. Then, $FE = \\sqrt{DF^2 + DE^2} = \\sqrt{(1 - x)^2 + x^2}$. Since triangle $BDF$ is also a right triangle, $BD^2 = DF^2 + BF^2$. As $BD = \\sqrt{2}$, we can find the relationship between $x$ and the side lengths.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the relationship between $x$ and the side lengths\nWe have $BD^2 = DF^2 + BF^2$, so $2 = (1 - x)^2 + (1 - x)^2$. Simplifying, $2 = 2(1 - x)^2$, which gives $(1 - x)^2 = 1$. Thus, $1 - x = \\pm 1$, but since $x$ is a length, $1 - x = 1$ is not possible. So, $1 - x = -1$ is not valid, we need to reconsider our equations.\n\n## Step 11: Reconsider the equations and find the correct relationship\nLet's analyze the triangle $FDE$ again. As $FD = DE$, triangle $FDE$ is an isosceles right triangle. Considering triangle $BDE$, we have $BD^2 = BE^2 + DE^2$. Since $BD = \\sqrt{2}$ and $BE = 1 - x$, we have $2 = (1 - x)^2 + DE^2$. However, we need to express $DE$ in terms of $x$.\n\n## Step 12: Express $DE$ in terms of $x$\nAs $AE = x$, $DE = \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$. However, this is not correct. Let's consider the triangle $ADE$. We have $AD^2 = AE^2 + DE^2$, so $1 = x^2 + DE^2$. Thus, $DE = \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$.\n\n## Step 13: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $BDE$\nNow, let's apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $BDE$: $BD^2 = BE^2 + DE^2$. Substituting $BD = \\sqrt{2}$, $BE = 1 - x$, and $DE = \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$, we get $2 = (1 - x)^2 + 1 - x^2$. Simplifying this equation will give us the value of $x$.\n\n## Step 14: Solve for $x$\nExpanding $(1 - x)^2$ as $1 - 2x + x^2$, we have $2 = 1 - 2x + x^2 + 1 - x^2$. This simplifies to $2 = 2 - 2x$, which gives $2x = 0$. However, this is not correct as it implies $x = 0$. Let's reconsider our equations.\n\n## Step 15: Reconsider the equation and solve for $x$\nThe correct equation should be derived from the condition that $AD$ and $CD$ coincide when folded. This gives us $DE = x\\sqrt{2}$ and $DF = (1 - x)\\sqrt{2}$. Applying the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $FDE$, we have $FE^2 = DE^2 + DF^2$. Substituting $FE = 1$, $DE = x\\sqrt{2}$, and $DF = (1 - x)\\sqrt{2}$, we get $1 = 2x^2 + 2(1 - x)^2$. Simplifying this equation will give us the value of $x$.\n\n## Step 16: Solve the equation for $x$\nExpanding the equation $1 = 2x^2 + 2(1 - x)^2$, we get $1 = 2x^2 + 2(1 - 2x + x^2)$. This simplifies to $1 = 2x^2 + 2 - 4x + 2x^2$, which further simplifies to $4x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0$. Solving this quadratic equation will give us the value of $x$.\n\n## Step 17: Solve the quadratic equation\nThe quadratic equation $4x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0$ can be solved using the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Here, $a = 4$, $b = -4$, and $c = 1$. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 16}}{8}$. This simplifies to $x = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 18: Express $x$ in the required form\nHowever, we need to express $x$ in the form $\\sqrt{k} - m$. We can rewrite the equation $4x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0$ as $(2x - 1)^2 = 0$. This gives $2x - 1"
