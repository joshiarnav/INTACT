    "problem": "A hemisphere-shaped bowl with radius 1 foot is filled full with chocolate.  All of the chocolate is then evenly distributed between 27 congruent, smaller hemisphere-shaped molds.  What is the radius of each of the smaller molds, in feet?",
    "solution": "A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so a hemisphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$.  The large hemisphere-shaped bowl has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi(1^3) = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ cubic feet.\n\nLet each of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds have radius $r$.  Their total volume, in terms of $r$, is $27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$ cubic feet, so we have \\[27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi.\\]Dividing both sides by $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ yields $27r^3 =1$, so $r=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$ feet.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the volume of the original hemisphere-shaped bowl.\nThe volume \\(V\\) of a hemisphere with radius \\(r\\) is given by \\(V = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3\\). Given that the radius \\(r = 1\\) foot, we substitute this value into the formula to find the volume of the original bowl: \\(V = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi (1)^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\) cubic feet.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the volume of chocolate each smaller mold will receive.\nSince the chocolate from the original bowl is evenly distributed among 27 smaller hemisphere-shaped molds, we divide the total volume of the original bowl by 27 to find the volume of chocolate each smaller mold will receive: \\(V_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}\\pi}{27} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi \\times \\frac{1}{27} = \\frac{2}{81}\\pi\\) cubic feet.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the radius of each smaller hemisphere-shaped mold.\nThe volume of each smaller hemisphere-shaped mold is given by \\(V_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi r_{\\text{small}}^3\\), where \\(r_{\\text{small}}\\) is the radius of the smaller mold. We set this equal to the volume of chocolate each mold receives: \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r_{\\text{small}}^3 = \\frac{2}{81}\\pi\\). Simplifying, we find \\(r_{\\text{small}}^3 = \\frac{1}{27}\\), which implies \\(r_{\\text{small}} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\) feet.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$"
