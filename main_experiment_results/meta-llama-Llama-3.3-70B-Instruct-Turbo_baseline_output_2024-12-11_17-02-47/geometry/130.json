    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the measure of angle QRC, we first need to identify the relationship between the angles given in the problem and how they relate to the circle with center C.\n## Step 2:  Given that the sides of triangle PQR are tangent to the circle with center C, we know that line segments PC, QC, and RC are each radii of the circle and thus are perpendicular to the sides of the triangle at the points of tangency.\n## Step 3:  We are provided with the measures of angles PQR and QPR, which are 63 degrees and 59 degrees, respectively.\n## Step 4:  The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. Using this fact, we can calculate the measure of angle PRQ.\n## Step 5:  Angle PRQ = 180 - (angle PQR + angle QPR) = 180 - (63 + 59) = 180 - 122 = 58 degrees.\n## Step 6:  Since line RC is a radius of the circle and is perpendicular to the side PR of the triangle, it bisects angle PRQ into two equal angles.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, angle QRC = angle PRQ / 2 = 58 / 2 = 29 degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{29}$"
