    "model_solution": "## Step 1: The hexagon can be divided into smaller shapes to simplify the calculation of its area.\nThe hexagon can be divided into 4 triangles and a rectangle.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the area of the rectangle.\nThe rectangle has a length of 6 units (from -3 to 3 on the y-axis) and a width of 4 units (from 0 to 4 on the x-axis), but the part of the rectangle that is inside the hexagon is from 1 to 3 on the x-axis, so the width is 2 units (from 1 to 3 on the x-axis) and the length is 4 units (from -2 to 2 on the y-axis, but the hexagon extends to 3 units on both the positive and negative y-axis, thus 6 units), but the part of the rectangle that is inside the hexagon is 4 units in height and 6 units in width, however the width is from 1 to 3, so 2 units in width, but the area of the 4 triangles is subtracted from the area of the rectangle to find the area of the hexagon, thus the area of the rectangle that is used is 6 units in length and 4 units in width, which equals an area of 6 * 4 = 24 square units.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area of the 4 triangles.\nThe base of each triangle is 1 unit (the distance between the x-coordinates of two adjacent vertices) and the height of each triangle is 3 units (the distance between the y-coordinates of two adjacent vertices). So the area of one triangle is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 1 * 3 = 1.5 square units. Since there are 4 such triangles, the total area of the triangles is 4 * 1.5 = 6 square units.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the hexagon by subtracting the area of the triangles from the area of the rectangle.\nArea of hexagon = Area of rectangle - Area of triangles = 24 - 6 = 18 square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$"
