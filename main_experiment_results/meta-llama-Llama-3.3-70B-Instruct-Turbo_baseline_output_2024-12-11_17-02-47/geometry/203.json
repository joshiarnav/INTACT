    "problem": "A circle centered at $O$ is circumscribed about $\\triangle ABC$ as follows: [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pO;\npO = (0, 0);\npA = pO + dir(-20);\npB = pO + dir(90);\npC = pO + dir(190);\ndraw(pA--pB--pC--pA);\ndraw(pO--pA);\ndraw(pO--pB);\ndraw(pO--pC);\nlabel(\"$O$\", pO, S);\nlabel(\"$110^\\circ$\", pO, NE);\nlabel(\"$100^\\circ$\", pO, NW);\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, SE);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, N);\nlabel(\"$C$\", pC, SW);\ndraw(circle(pO, 1));\n[/asy] What is the measure of $\\angle BAC$, in degrees?",
    "solution": "We can see that $\\angle AOC = 360^\\circ - (110^\\circ + 100^\\circ) = 150^\\circ.$ Now, $\\triangle AOC$ and $\\triangle AOB$ are both isosceles triangles. That means that $\\angle OAC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (180^\\circ - 150^\\circ) = 15^\\circ$ and $\\angle OAB = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (180^\\circ - 110^\\circ) = 35^\\circ.$  Therefore, our answer is $\\angle BAC = \\angle OAB + \\angle OAC = 15^\\circ + 35^\\circ = \\boxed{50^\\circ}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\nIn the context of a circle circumscribed about a triangle, this means that the angles of the triangle are half the measure of their respective intercepted arcs.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the measures of the arcs intercepted by the angles of $\\triangle ABC$.\nGiven that $\\angle AOB = 110^\\circ$ and $\\angle AOC = 100^\\circ$, and knowing that $\\angle BOC$ would be $360^\\circ - (110^\\circ + 100^\\circ)$ because the sum of the angles around a point is $360^\\circ$, we can determine the measure of $\\angle BOC$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the measure of $\\angle BOC$.\n$\\angle BOC = 360^\\circ - (110^\\circ + 100^\\circ) = 360^\\circ - 210^\\circ = 150^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the measure of $\\angle BAC$ using the inscribed angle theorem.\nThe measure of $\\angle BAC$ is half the measure of the arc $\\widehat{BC}$, which is the same as $\\angle BOC$. Therefore, $\\angle BAC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\angle BOC$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the measure of $\\angle BAC$.\n$\\angle BAC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 150^\\circ = 75^\\circ$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{75}$"
