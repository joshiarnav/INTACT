    "problem": "Jimmy owns a cube-shaped container that measures $10$ inches on each side. He fills this container with water until it is half full. Then he throws ten giant ice cubes that measure $2$ inches on each side into the container. In inches cubed, how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water?",
    "solution": "First let's compute the volume of the container. The container measures $10\\times10\\times10$ so its volume is  $$10\\cdot10\\cdot10=10^3=1000$$inches cubed. Since the container is only half full, there are $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10^3=500$$inches cubed of water in it. Additionally, there are ten ice cubes each with a volume of $2^3$. This means that the total volume of the ice cubes is $$10\\cdot2^3=10\\cdot8=80.$$Altogether, the water and the ice cubes occupy $500+80=580$ inches cubed. This means that there are $1000-580=\\boxed{420}$ inches cubed of space in the container unoccupied by water and ice.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the volume of the container\nThe container is a cube with each side measuring 10 inches, so its volume is $10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 1000$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the volume of water in the container\nThe container is half full of water, so the volume of water is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1000 = 500$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the volume of one giant ice cube\nEach ice cube is a cube with each side measuring 2 inches, so its volume is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total volume of the ten giant ice cubes\nSince there are ten ice cubes, the total volume of the ice cubes is $10 \\times 8 = 80$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total volume occupied by water and ice\nThe total volume occupied by water and ice is $500 + 80 = 580$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the volume of the container unoccupied by ice or water\nThe volume of the container unoccupied by ice or water is $1000 - 580 = 420$ cubic inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{420}$"
