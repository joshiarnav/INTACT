    "solution": "Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the dimensions of the box. It is given that \\[140=4a+4b+4c{\\qquad \\rm and\n\\qquad}21=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}\\] hence \\[35=a+b+c{\\qquad (1)\\qquad\n\\rm and\\qquad}441=a^2+b^2+c^2{\\qquad (2)}.\\]\n\nSquare both sides of $(1)$ and combine with $(2)$ to obtain \\begin{align*}\n1225 & = (a+b+c)^2 \\\\\n&= a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2bc+2ca \\\\\n&= 441+2ab+2bc+2ca.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus the surface area of the box is \\[ 2ab+2bc+2ca=1225-441=\\boxed{784}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the variables for the dimensions of the rectangular box\nLet's denote the length, width, and height of the rectangular box as $a$, $b$, and $c$, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Express the sum of the lengths of the twelve edges of the box\nThe sum of the lengths of the twelve edges is given by $4a + 4b + 4c = 140$, which simplifies to $a + b + c = 35$.\n\n## Step 3: Express the distance from one corner to the farthest corner of the box\nThe distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner can be represented as $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = 21$.\n\n## Step 4: Square both sides of the equation from step 3 to eliminate the square root\nSquaring both sides gives $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 441$.\n\n## Step 5: Use the equation from step 2 to find an expression that can be used to substitute into the equation from step 4\nSquaring the equation $a + b + c = 35$ yields $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 1225$.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute the result of step 4 into the equation from step 5 to solve for the surface area\nSubstituting $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 441$ into the squared equation gives $441 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 1225$, which simplifies to $2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 784$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total surface area of the box\nThe total surface area of the box is given by $2ab + 2ac + 2bc$, so the surface area is $784$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{784}$"
