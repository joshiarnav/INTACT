The other leg, which is also the height of the original triangle, has length $\\sqrt{9^2-4^2}=\\sqrt{65}$.  Thus, the original triangle has base length 8, height $\\sqrt{65}$, and area \\[\\frac{1}{2}(8)(\\sqrt{65})=\\boxed{4\\sqrt{65}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the type of triangle\nThe triangle has side lengths 8, 9, and 9, which means it is an isosceles triangle because two sides have equal lengths.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the height of the triangle\nTo find the area, we need the height of the triangle. Since it's an isosceles triangle, drawing a line from the vertex opposite the base to the midpoint of the base will create two right triangles. This line is also the height (altitude) of the isosceles triangle.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the height\nThe base of the triangle is 8 units (the unequal side), and the other two sides are 9 units each. When we split the triangle in half, we get two right triangles with one leg being half of the base (8/2 = 4 units) and the hypotenuse being 9 units. We can use the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) to find the other leg, which is the height (h) of the original triangle.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the Pythagorean theorem calculation\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem: h^2 + 4^2 = 9^2.\nThis simplifies to: h^2 + 16 = 81.\nSubtract 16 from both sides: h^2 = 65.\nTake the square root of both sides: h = sqrt(65).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the area of the triangle\nThe formula for the area of a triangle is (base * height) / 2. Substituting the known values gives: Area = (8 * sqrt(65)) / 2.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the area formula\nArea = (8 * sqrt(65)) / 2 = 4 * sqrt(65).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4 \\sqrt{65}}$"
