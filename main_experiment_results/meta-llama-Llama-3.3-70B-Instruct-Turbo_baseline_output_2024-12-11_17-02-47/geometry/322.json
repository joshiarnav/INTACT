    "problem": "The radius of a cylinder is doubled and its height is tripled. If its original volume was 10 cubic feet, what is its volume now, in cubic feet?",
    "solution": "Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively.  The new cylinder has volume \\[\n\\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\\pi r^2 h,\n\\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume.  Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder\nThe volume \\(V\\) of a cylinder is given by the formula \\(V = \\pi r^2 h\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the cylinder and \\(h\\) is its height.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the original volume using the given information\nGiven that the original volume is 10 cubic feet, we can write this as \\(10 = \\pi r^2 h\\), but we don't need to solve for \\(r\\) or \\(h\\) explicitly since we're interested in how the volume changes when \\(r\\) and \\(h\\) are modified.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the effect of doubling the radius and tripling the height on the volume\nIf the radius is doubled (\\(2r\\)) and the height is tripled (\\(3h\\)), the new volume \\(V'\\) can be calculated using the modified formula \\(V' = \\pi (2r)^2 (3h)\\).\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression for the new volume\nSubstitute the changes into the formula: \\(V' = \\pi (4r^2) (3h) = 12\\pi r^2 h\\).\n\n## Step 5: Compare the new volume to the original volume\nSince the original volume \\(V = \\pi r^2 h = 10\\) cubic feet, the new volume \\(V'\\) is \\(12\\) times the original volume, because \\(V' = 12 \\times \\pi r^2 h\\).\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the new volume\nGiven that the original volume is 10 cubic feet, the new volume is \\(12 \\times 10 = 120\\) cubic feet.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{120}$"
