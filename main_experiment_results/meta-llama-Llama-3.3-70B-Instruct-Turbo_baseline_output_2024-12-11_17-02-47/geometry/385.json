    "problem": "What is the volume in cubic inches of a right, rectangular prism with side, front and bottom faces having an area 15 square inches, 10 square inches and 6 square inches, respectively?",
    "solution": "Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the areas of the three faces of the rectangular prism.\nThe areas of the side, front, and bottom faces are given as 15 square inches, 10 square inches, and 6 square inches, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Assign variables to the dimensions of the rectangular prism.\nLet's denote the length, width, and height of the prism as $l$, $w$, and $h$, respectively.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate equations based on the given areas of the faces.\nThe area of the side face is $l \\times h = 15$, the area of the front face is $w \\times h = 10$, and the area of the bottom face is $l \\times w = 6$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the system of equations to find the values of $l$, $w$, and $h$.\nFrom the equation $l \\times w = 6$, we can express $l$ in terms of $w$ as $l = \\frac{6}{w}$.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute $l = \\frac{6}{w}$ into the equation $l \\times h = 15$ to find $h$ in terms of $w$.\n$\\frac{6}{w} \\times h = 15$ implies $h = \\frac{15w}{6} = \\frac{5w}{2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute $h = \\frac{5w}{2}$ into the equation $w \\times h = 10$ to solve for $w$.\n$w \\times \\frac{5w}{2} = 10$ implies $\\frac{5w^2}{2} = 10$, so $5w^2 = 20$, and thus $w^2 = 4$, which gives $w = 2$ (since $w$ must be positive).\n\n## Step 7: Find the value of $l$ using $w = 2$ in the equation $l \\times w = 6$.\n$l \\times 2 = 6$ implies $l = 3$.\n\n## Step 8: Find the value of $h$ using $w = 2$ in the equation $h = \\frac{5w}{2}$.\n$h = \\frac{5 \\times 2}{2} = 5$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the volume of the rectangular prism using the formula $V = l \\times w \\times h$.\n$V = 3 \\times 2 \\times 5 = 30$ cubic inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$"
