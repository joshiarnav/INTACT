The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is the sum of these, which is $3s$.  The area of $\\triangle ABC$ may also be expressed as $(\\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$, so $3s = (\\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$.

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and recall the properties of an equilateral triangle.\nThe problem involves an equilateral triangle $\\triangle ABC$ and a point $P$ inside it. From $P$, perpendiculars $PQ$, $PR$, and $PS$ are drawn to the sides $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{CA}$, respectively. Given $PQ=1$, $PR=2$, and $PS=3$, we need to find the length of $AB$ in terms of radicals.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle and the relationship between the area and the perpendiculars.\nThe area $A$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by $A = \\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$. Additionally, the area of the triangle can be expressed as the sum of the areas of the three triangles formed by the perpendiculars, which is $A = \\frac{1}{2} (PQ + PR + PS) s$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up an equation to relate the area of the equilateral triangle to the given perpendicular lengths.\nGiven that $PQ=1$, $PR=2$, and $PS=3$, the sum of these lengths is $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$. Using the area formula $A = \\frac{1}{2} (PQ + PR + PS) s$, we can write $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot s = 3s$.\n\n## Step 4: Equate the two expressions for the area of the equilateral triangle and solve for $s$.\nSetting the two area expressions equal to each other, we have $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} = 3s$. To solve for $s$, we first multiply both sides by $4$ to get $s^2 \\sqrt{3} = 12s$. Then, we rearrange the equation to $s^2 \\sqrt{3} - 12s = 0$ and factor out an $s$ to get $s(\\sqrt{3}s - 12) = 0$. Since $s$ cannot be $0$ (as it is the side length of the triangle), we solve $\\sqrt{3}s - 12 = 0$ for $s$. This gives $\\sqrt{3}s = 12$, and thus $s = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Rationalizing the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{3}$, we obtain $s = \\frac{12\\sqrt{3}}{3} = 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$"
