    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and the relationships between the different components of the triangle $ABC$ and point $D$.\nWe have a right triangle $ABC$ with $AC = 7,$ $BC = 24,$ and right angle at $C.$ Point $M$ is the midpoint of $AB,$ and $D$ is on the same side of line $AB$ as $C$ so that $AD = BD = 15.$\n\n## Step 2: Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the length of $AB$.\nBy applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle $ABC$, we get $AB = \\sqrt{AC^2 + BC^2} = \\sqrt{7^2 + 24^2} = \\sqrt{49 + 576} = \\sqrt{625} = 25$.\n\n## Step 3: Since $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, we can determine the length of $AM$ and $BM$.\nGiven that $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, we have $AM = BM = \\frac{AB}{2} = \\frac{25}{2}$.\n\n## Step 4: We need to find the area of triangle $CDM$.\nTo calculate the area of triangle $CDM$, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle: $Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\times base \\times height$. Here, the base is $DM$ and the height is the perpendicular distance from $C$ to line $AB$.\n\n## Step 5: To find the height of triangle $CDM$, we can use the fact that $CD$ is the hypotenuse of right triangle $CDB$ and apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find $CD$.\nHowever, we first need to find $CD$. To find $CD$, we can use the fact that $AD = BD = 15$ and apply the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle $ADB$ or use other properties of the triangle.\n\n## Step 6: Instead of directly calculating $CD$, let's use the property that the area of triangle $CDM$ can also be expressed as $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot CM \\cdot DM \\cdot \\sin(\\angle CMD)$ or use similar triangles to find the height.\nConsidering the triangle $ABC$ and the fact that $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, we can find the height of triangle $CDM$ by using similar triangles or other geometric properties.\n\n## Step 7: Using the similar triangles $ACM$ and $BCM$, and knowing that $CM$ is the height of triangle $ABC$, we can find $CM$.\n$CM = \\frac{AC \\cdot BC}{AB} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 24}{25} = \\frac{168}{25}$.\n\n## Step 8: Next, let's find the length of $DM$ using the fact that $AD = BD = 15$ and $AM = BM = \\frac{25}{2}$.\nWe can find $DM$ by using the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $ADM$ or by using other geometric properties.\n\n## Step 9: However, calculating $DM$ directly is complex, so let's consider using similar triangles or the Pythagorean Theorem in a different approach to find the area of triangle $CDM$.\nUsing the fact that $AD = BD = 15$, we can find the height of triangle $CDM$ by dropping a perpendicular from $C$ to $AB$ and using similar triangles.\n\n## Step 10: Let's denote the foot of the perpendicular from $C$ to $AB$ as $N$.\n$CN$ is the height of triangle $ABC$ and can be found using $CN = \\frac{AC \\cdot BC}{AB} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 24}{25} = \\frac{168}{25}$.\n\n## Step 11: Now, we need to find the length of $MN$ to calculate the area of triangle $CDM$.\n$MN = AM - AN = \\frac{25}{2} - \\frac{7 \\cdot 24}{25} \\cdot \\frac{25}{24} = \\frac{25}{2} - 7 = \\frac{25 - 14}{2} = \\frac{11}{2}$.\n\n## Step 12: We also need to find $DN$ to calculate the area of triangle $CDM$ using the base $DM$ and height $CN$.\nHowever, since $DN$ is not directly needed for the area calculation using the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot DM \\cdot CN$, we proceed with calculating the area using known values.\n\n## Step 13: The area of triangle $CDM$ can be calculated using the formula $Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot DM \\cdot CN$ or by using similar triangles and the known area of triangle $ABC$.\nThe area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AC \\cdot BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 7 \\cdot 24 = 84$. The area of triangle $CDM$ can also be expressed in terms of the area of triangle $ABC$ and the ratio of sides.\n\n## Step 14: Since $DM$ is the base of triangle $CDM$ and $CN$ is the height, we can use similar triangles to find the ratio of areas.\nHowever, let's simplify the calculation by directly using the known values and properties of right triangles.\n\n## Step 15: To calculate the area of triangle $CDM$, we can use the formula $Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot base \\cdot height$.\nGiven that $CN = \\frac{168}{25}$ and using similar triangles or the ratio of sides, we can find the area of triangle $CDM$.\n\n## Step 16: Let's denote the area of triangle $CDM$ as $A_{CDM}$.\nUsing the similar triangles $ACM$ and $BCM$, and the fact that $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, we can express the area of triangle $CDM$ in terms of $CN$ and $DM$.\n\n## Step 17: Since $AD = BD = 15$, triangle $ ABD$ is an isosceles triangle.\nUsing this information and the properties of right triangles, we can find the area of triangle $CDM$.\n\n## Step 18: Let's use the fact that the area of triangle $CDM$ can be expressed as $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot CN \\cdot DM$.\nGiven that $CN = \\frac{168}{25}$ and $DM = \\sqrt{AD^2 - AM^2} = \\sqrt{15^2 - \\left(\\frac{25}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{225 - \\frac{625}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{900 - 625}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{275}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{275}}{2}$, we can calculate the area.\n\n## Step 19: Now, let's calculate the area of triangle $CDM$ using the formula $A_{CDM} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot CN \\cdot DM$.\n$A_{CDM} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{168}{25} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{275}}{2} = \\frac{168 \\cdot \\sqrt{275}}{100} = \\frac{84 \\cdot \\sqrt{275}}{50} = \\frac{84 \\cdot 5\\sqrt{11}}{50} = \\frac{42 \\cdot \\sqrt{11}}{5}$.\n\n## Step 20: The area of triangle $CDM$ is $\\frac{42 \\cdot \\sqrt{11}}{5}$, so the values of $m$, $n$, and $p$ are $42$, $11$, and $5$ respectively.\nThus, the sum $m + n + p = 42 + 11 + 5 = 58$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{58}$"
