    "problem": "Square $ABCD$ has sides of length 2. Set $S$ is the set of all line segments that have length 2 and whose endpoints are on adjacent sides of the square. The midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ enclose a region whose area to the nearest hundredth is $k$. Find $100k$.\n",
    "solution": "Without loss of generality, let $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, $(0,2)$, and $(2,2)$ be the vertices of the square. Suppose the endpoints of the segment lie on the two sides of the square determined by the vertex $(0,0)$. Let the two endpoints of the segment have coordinates $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$. Because the segment has length 2, $x^2+y^2=4$. Using the midpoint formula, we find that the midpoint of the segment has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Let $d$ be the distance from $(0,0)$ to $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Using the distance formula we see that $d=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2}= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}\\left(x^2+y^2\\right)}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}(4)}=1$. Thus the midpoints lying on the sides determined by vertex $(0,0)$ form a quarter-circle with radius 1.\n[asy] size(100); pointpen=black;pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); pair A=(0,0),B=(2,0),C=(2,2),D=(0,2); D(A--B--C--D--A);  picture p; draw(p,CR(A,1));draw(p,CR(B,1));draw(p,CR(C,1));draw(p,CR(D,1)); clip(p,A--B--C--D--cycle); add(p); [/asy]\nThe set of all midpoints forms a quarter circle at each corner of the square.

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the geometry of the problem\nWe have a square $ABCD$ with sides of length 2. The set $S$ consists of all line segments of length 2 with endpoints on adjacent sides of the square.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the midpoint formation\nThe midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ form a quarter circle at each corner of the square $ABCD$. This is because the line segments in $S$ can be thought of as the radii of a circle with radius 1 (since the segments have a length of 2, the radius is half of that), and their midpoints would form a quarter circle.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area enclosed by the midpoints\nThe midpoints form a quarter circle at each corner of the square. The radius of these quarter circles is 1. The area enclosed by all midpoints is the area of the square minus the areas of the four quarter circles. The area of the square is $2 \\times 2 = 4$. The area of one quarter circle is $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi(1)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, so the area of four quarter circles is $4 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\pi$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total enclosed area\nThe total enclosed area is $4 - \\pi$. To find the area to the nearest hundredth, we compute $4 - \\pi \\approx 4 - 3.14159 \\approx 0.85841$.\n\n## Step 5: Find $100k$\nGiven that $k$ is the area to the nearest hundredth, $k \\approx 0.85841$. Therefore, $100k \\approx 100 \\times 0.85841 \\approx 85.841$. Rounded to the nearest whole number as requested, $100k \\approx 86$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{86}$"
