    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the equation of a line with slope 3 that divides a given region $\\mathcal{R}$ into two equal areas. The region $\\mathcal{R}$ consists of eight circles packed in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the line's equation form\nWe're given that the line's equation is in the form $ax = by + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers with a greatest common divisor of 1.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the line's slope\nThe line has a slope of 3, which can be expressed as $y = 3x + c$. To convert this into the required form, we can rewrite it as $3x = y - c$ and then further manipulate it to get $3x = 1y - c$, which matches the given form.\n\n## Step 4: Find the value of c\nWe need to find the value of $c$ that satisfies the condition of dividing the region $\\mathcal{R}$ into two equal areas.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the circles and the line\nThe line passes through the tangency point of the bottom left circle and the one to its right. It also passes through the tangency of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it. This information can help us determine the line's position and find the value of $c$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the coordinates of the tangency points\nThe tangency point of the bottom left circle and the one to its right is $\\left(1, 1\\right)$. The tangency point of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it is $\\left(3, 3\\right)$.\n\n## Step 7: Use the coordinates to find the value of c\nWe can use the coordinates of the tangency points to find the value of $c$. Substituting $\\left(1, 1\\right)$ into the equation $y = 3x + c$, we get $1 = 3(1) + c$, which simplifies to $c = -2$.\n\n## Step 8: Express the line's equation in the required form\nThe line's equation is $y = 3x - 2$, which can be rewritten as $3x = y + 2$. Comparing this with the required form $ax = by + c$, we find $a = 3$, $b = 1$, and $c = 2$ (after adjusting for the positive value of $c$ as per the problem statement).\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the sum of the squares of a, b, and c\nTo find the final answer, we calculate $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3^2 + 1^2 + 2^2$.\n\n## Step 10: Compute the sum\n$3^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 9 + 1 + 4 = 14$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{138}$"
