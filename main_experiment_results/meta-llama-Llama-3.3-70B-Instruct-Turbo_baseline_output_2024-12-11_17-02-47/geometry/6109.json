    "problem": "A right circular cone has base radius $r$ and height $h$. The cone lies on its side on a flat table. As the cone rolls on the surface of the table without slipping, the point where the cone's base meets the table traces a circular arc centered at the point where the vertex touches the table. The cone first returns to its original position on the table after making $17$ complete rotations. The value of $h/r$ can be written in the form $m\\sqrt {n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n$.\n",
    "solution": "The path is a circle with radius equal to the slant height of the cone, which is $\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}}$. Thus, the length of the path is $2\\pi\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}}$.\nAlso, the length of the path is 17 times the circumference of the base, which is $34r\\pi$. Setting these equal gives $\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}} = 17r$, or $h^{2} = 288r^{2}$. Thus, $\\dfrac{h^{2}}{r^{2}} = 288$, and $\\dfrac{h}{r} = 12\\sqrt {2}$, giving an answer of $12 + 2 = \\boxed{14}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the path traced by the cone as it rolls\nThe cone rolls on the table without slipping, and the point where the cone's base meets the table traces a circular arc. This path is essentially a circle with a radius equal to the slant height of the cone, which can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem as $\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the circumference of the circular path\nThe circumference of the circular path traced by the cone is $2\\pi\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$, as this is the distance around the circle.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the circumference of the cone's base\nThe circumference of the cone's base is $2\\pi r$, which is the distance around the base of the cone.\n\n## Step 4: Understand the relationship between the cone's rotations and the path's circumference\nSince the cone returns to its original position after making 17 complete rotations, the circumference of the circular path is 17 times the circumference of the cone's base. This relationship can be expressed as $2\\pi\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2} = 17(2\\pi r)$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the equation from Step 4\nDivide both sides of the equation by $2\\pi$ to simplify: $\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2} = 17r$.\n\n## Step 6: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root\nSquaring both sides of the equation yields $r^2 + h^2 = 289r^2$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $h^2$\nRearrange the equation to isolate $h^2$: $h^2 = 289r^2 - r^2 = 288r^2$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $h/r$\nTake the square root of both sides to solve for $h/r$: $h/r = \\sqrt{288}$.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify $\\sqrt{288}$\n$\\sqrt{288}$ can be simplified as $\\sqrt{144 \\cdot 2} = 12\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate $m + n$\nThe value of $h/r$ is $12\\sqrt{2}$, so $m = 12$ and $n = 2$. Therefore, $m + n = 12 + 2 = 14$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12 + 2}$"
