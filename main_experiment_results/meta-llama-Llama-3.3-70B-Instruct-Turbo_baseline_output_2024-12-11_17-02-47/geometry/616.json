    "problem": "A triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units. The length of the third side is $x$ units, where $x$ is an integer. What is the largest possible perimeter of the triangle?",
    "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the triangle inequality theorem\nThe triangle inequality theorem states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. This means that for our triangle with sides of length 5, 6, and $x$, the following inequalities must hold: $5 + 6 > x$, $5 + x > 6$, and $6 + x > 5$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the inequalities\nSimplifying the inequalities from Step 1, we get: $11 > x$, $x > 1$, and $x > -1$. Since $x$ is an integer and the length of a side cannot be negative, we can disregard the last inequality. Thus, we have $11 > x$ and $x > 1$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the range for $x$\nCombining the inequalities from Step 2, we find that $x$ must be an integer greater than 1 and less than 11. This gives us a range for $x$: $1 < x < 11$. Since $x$ is an integer, the possible values for $x$ are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\n\n## Step 4: Find the largest possible perimeter\nThe perimeter $P$ of the triangle is given by the sum of its sides: $P = 5 + 6 + x = 11 + x$. To find the largest possible perimeter, we need to choose the largest possible value for $x$ from the range determined in Step 3. The largest integer value for $x$ that satisfies the inequalities is 10.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the largest possible perimeter\nSubstitute the largest possible value of $x$ into the perimeter formula: $P = 11 + 10 = 21$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$"
