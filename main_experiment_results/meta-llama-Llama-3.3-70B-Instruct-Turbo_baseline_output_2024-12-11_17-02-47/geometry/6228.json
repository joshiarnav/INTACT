Draw $X$, where $X$ is on $BC$ and $AC \\parallel PX$. By AA Similarity, $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle PBX$, so $PX = 3an$, $BX = 4an$, and $CX = 4an - 4n$.\nAlso, let $\\angle ABC = a$ and $\\angle BAC = b$. Since the angles of a triangle add up to $180^{\\circ}$, $\\angle BCA = 180-a-b$. By Exterior Angle Theorem, $\\angle ACX = a+b$, and since $CP$ bisects $\\angle ACX$, $\\angle PCX = \\frac{a+b}{2}$. Because $AC \\parallel PX$, $\\angle BXP = 180 - a - b$. Thus, $\\angle CPX = \\frac{a+b}{2}$, making $\\triangle CPX$ an isosceles triangle.\nBecause $\\triangle CPX$ is isosceles, $PX = CX$, so $4an - 4n = 3an$. That means $a = 4$, so $PB = 4 \\cdot AB$. Thus, $PA = PB - AB = 3 \\cdot AB$, so $PA : AB = \\boxed{3:1}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Apply Angle Bisector Theorem to find the ratio of lengths of the segments that the angle bisector intersects.\nThe Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, an angle bisector divides the side opposite the angle into segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle. However, in this case, we are dealing with the exterior angle bisector. For the exterior angle bisector theorem, the ratio of the lengths of the segments of the extended side that are formed by intersecting an exterior angle bisector and the side is related to the ratio of the other two sides of the triangle.\n\n## Step 2: Use the Exterior Angle Bisector Theorem to relate the ratios of the segments.\nGiven that $AC:CB = 3:4$, according to the Exterior Angle Bisector Theorem, the ratio $PA:AB$ will be related to the ratio of the sides $AC$ and $CB$. Specifically, the theorem states that $PA:AB = AC:CB$ when considering the exterior angle bisector of $\\angle ACB$ intersecting the extension of $AB$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the ratio $PA:AB$ using the given ratio $AC:CB = 3:4$.\nGiven the ratio $AC:CB = 3:4$ and applying the Exterior Angle Bisector Theorem, we find that $PA:AB = AC:CB = 3:4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3:1}$"
