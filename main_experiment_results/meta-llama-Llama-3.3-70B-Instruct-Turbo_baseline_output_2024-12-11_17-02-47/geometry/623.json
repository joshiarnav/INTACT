    "solution": "Let the coordinates of $A$ be $(a_1,a_2)$. Then since $A$ is on the graph of $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, we know that $a_2 = -\\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$. We can also use our knowledge of special right triangles to write $a_2$ in terms of $a_1$. Let $C$ be the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ and let $O$ be the origin. Then $OCA$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, so the ratio of the length of $OC$ to the length of $CA$ is $\\sqrt{3}:1$. Now the coordinates of C are $(0, a_2)$, so the length of $OC$ is just $-a_2$ (since $a_2$ is negative) and the length of $CA$ is $a_1$. This means $\\dfrac{-a_2}{a_1}=\\sqrt{3} \\Longrightarrow a_2=-\\sqrt{3}a_1$.\n\nWe can now set our two equations for $a_2$ equal to each other and get $-\\sqrt{3}a_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$. Multiplying both sides by $-\\frac{2}{a_1}$ immediately gives $a_1=2\\sqrt{3}$. From here we could solve for $a_2$ using one of our equations and then use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the side length of the equilateral triangle, but there's a better way. We remember that the hypotenuse of our special triangle is twice as long as the shortest side of it, which has length $a_1=2\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore our answer is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To solve this problem, we need to first understand the properties of an equilateral triangle and how it relates to the given graph of $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$.\nThe graph of $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$ is a downward-facing parabola, and we want to find two points $A$ and $B$ on this graph such that triangle $ABO$ is equilateral.\n\n## Step 2: Since triangle $ABO$ is equilateral, the distance from $A$ to $O$ is the same as the distance from $B$ to $O$, and both are equal to the length of one side of the equilateral triangle.\nLet's denote the coordinates of point $A$ as $(x, -\\frac{1}{2}x^2)$ and the coordinates of point $B$ as $(-x, -\\frac{1}{2}x^2)$, as $A$ and $B$ are symmetric about the $y$-axis.\n\n## Step 3: Using the distance formula, the distance from $A$ to $O$ is given by $\\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 0\\right)^2}$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4}$.\nSimilarly, the distance from $B$ to $O$ is $\\sqrt{(-x-0)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 0\\right)^2}$, which also simplifies to $\\sqrt{x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4}$.\n\n## Step 4: The distance from $A$ to $B$ can be found using the distance formula as well, which gives us $\\sqrt{(x-(-x))^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}x^2\\right)\\right)^2}$, simplifying to $\\sqrt{(2x)^2 + 0}$, which further simplifies to $2x$.\nSince triangle $ABO$ is equilateral, the distance from $A$ to $B$ is equal to the distance from $A$ to $O$, so we have $2x = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4}$.\n\n## Step 5: Squaring both sides of the equation $2x = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4}$ gives $4x^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4$.\nRearranging the terms, we get $\\frac{1}{4}x^4 - 3x^2 = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Factoring out $x^2$ from the equation $\\frac{1}{4}x^4 - 3x^2 = 0$ gives $x^2\\left(\\frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3\\right) = 0$.\nThis implies that either $x^2 = 0$ or $\\frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3 = 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Solving for $x^2$ in the equation $\\frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3 = 0$ gives $\\frac{1}{4}x^2 = 3$, which simplifies to $x^2 = 12$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $x = \\pm \\sqrt{12}$, which further simplifies to $x = \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n## Step 8: Since the coordinates of point $A$ are $(x, -\\frac{1}{2}x^2)$ and we found $x = \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}$, the coordinates of $A$ can be $(2\\sqrt{3}, -6)$ or $(-2\\sqrt{3}, -6)$.\nGiven that $A$ and $B$ are symmetric about the $y$-axis, if $A$ is $(2\\sqrt{3}, -6)$, then $B$ is $(-2\\sqrt{3}, -6)$, and vice versa.\n\n## Step 9: The length of one side of the equilateral triangle $ABO$ is the distance from $A$ to $B$, which we already determined to be $2x$.\nSubstituting $x = 2\\sqrt{3}$ into $2x$ gives us $2(2\\sqrt{3}) = 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$"
