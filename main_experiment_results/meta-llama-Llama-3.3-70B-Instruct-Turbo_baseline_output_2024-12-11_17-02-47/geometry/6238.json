    "problem": "Two points $A(x_1, y_1)$ and $B(x_2, y_2)$ are chosen on the graph of $f(x) = \\ln x$, with $0 < x_1 < x_2$. The points $C$ and $D$ trisect $\\overline{AB}$, with $AC < CB$. Through $C$ a horizontal line is drawn to cut the curve at $E(x_3, y_3)$. Find $x_3$ if $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 1000$.\n",
    "solution": "Since $C$ is the trisector of line segment $\\overline{AB}$ closer to $A$, the $y$-coordinate of $C$ is equal to two thirds the $y$-coordinate of $A$ plus one third the $y$-coordinate of $B$. Thus, point $C$ has coordinates $(x_0, \\frac{2}{3} \\ln 1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\ln 1000) = (x_0, \\ln 10)$ for some $x_0$. Then the horizontal line through $C$ has equation $y = \\ln 10$, and this intersects the curve $y = \\ln x$ at the point $(10, \\ln 10)$, so $x_3 = \\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Find the coordinates of point A and B\nFirst, we need to find the coordinates of points A and B. Given that $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 1000$, and the function $f(x) = \\ln x$, we can find the corresponding $y$-values. For point A, $y_1 = \\ln(1) = 0$. For point B, $y_2 = \\ln(1000)$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the value of $y_2$\nWe need to calculate the value of $y_2$. Given that $y_2 = \\ln(1000)$ and knowing that $\\ln(1000) = \\ln(10^3) = 3\\ln(10)$, we can approximate $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.3026$. Thus, $y_2 \\approx 3 \\times 2.3026 = 6.9078$. However, for the purpose of finding $x_3$, we'll keep $y_2$ in terms of $\\ln(1000)$ for precision.\n\n## Step 3: Find the coordinates of point C\nSince points C and D trisect $\\overline{AB}$, with $AC < CB$, point C is located at $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the distance from A to B. The $y$-coordinate of C, $y_c$, can be found by adding $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the difference between $y_2$ and $y_1$ to $y_1$. Thus, $y_c = y_1 + \\frac{1}{3}(y_2 - y_1) = 0 + \\frac{1}{3}(\\ln(1000) - 0) = \\frac{1}{3}\\ln(1000)$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the function $f(x) = \\ln x$ to find $x_3$\nGiven that the line through C is horizontal and cuts the curve at E, the $y$-coordinate of E, $y_3$, is equal to $y_c$. Since $y_3 = \\ln(x_3)$, we have $\\ln(x_3) = \\frac{1}{3}\\ln(1000)$. We know that $\\ln(1000) = \\ln(10^3) = 3\\ln(10)$, so $\\ln(x_3) = \\ln(10)$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $x_3$\nTo find $x_3$, we solve the equation $\\ln(x_3) = \\ln(10)$. This implies $x_3 = 10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
