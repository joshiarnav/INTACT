    "solution": "$\\triangle ABC$ is a right isosceles ($45^\\circ - 45^\\circ - 90^\\circ$) triangle, so $AC=AB\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2}$.  Thus, the side length of the octagon is $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWe can compute the octagon's area by subtracting the area of the four right isosceles triangles from the area of square $BDEF$.\n\nThe four right isosceles triangles are congruent by symmetry and each has an area of $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 1 \\cdot 1$, so their total area is \\[4\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 2.\\]  Each side of square $BDEF$ is comprised of a leg of a right isosceles triangle, a side of the octagon, and another leg of a different right isosceles triangle.  Hence, the side length of $BDEF$ is $1+\\sqrt{2}+1=2+\\sqrt{2}$, and the area of $BDEF$ is \\[(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4+2+4\\sqrt{2}.\\] Finally, the area of the octagon is \\[4+2+4\\sqrt{2} - 2 = \\boxed{4+4\\sqrt{2}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: The problem provides a square $BDEF$ and a regular octagon $ABCGHFED$.\nThe square $BDEF$ has side length $2 + \\sqrt{2}$, but to find this, we first need to calculate the length of the sides of the octagon.\n\n## Step 2: We are given that $AB = BC = 1$.\nThe length of $AB$ and $BC$ being $1$ unit each gives us a starting point to determine the dimensions of the octagon and the square.\n\n## Step 3: To find the area of the regular octagon $ABCGHFED$, we can start by finding the area of the square $BDEF$.\nThe area of the square is the square of its side length, which can be determined by using the length of $AB$, $BC$, and the properties of the $45-45-90$ triangle $ABC$.\n\n## Step 4: Triangle $ABC$ is a $45-45-90$ triangle since $AB = BC = 1$.\nIn a $45-45-90$ triangle, the sides are in the ratio $1:1:\\sqrt{2}$, so $AC = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\n## Step 5: By examining the figure, we see that the side length of square $BDEF$ is $2 + \\sqrt{2}$.\nThis length is derived by adding the length of $BC$ to the length of $CD$, where $CD$ is equal to $AC$ due to the properties of the regular octagon.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the area of square $BDEF$.\nArea of square $BDEF$ = side length squared = $(2 + \\sqrt{2})^2$.\n\n## Step 7: The area of the regular octagon $ABCGHFED$ can be found by subtracting the areas of the four isosceles right triangles from the area of square $BDEF$.\nEach of these triangles has a base and height of $1$, so their area can be easily calculated.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the area of one isosceles right triangle.\nArea of one triangle = $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot$ base $\\cdot$ height = $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the combined area of the four isosceles right triangles.\nCombined area of the four triangles = $4 \\cdot$ area of one triangle.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the area of the regular octagon $ABCGHFED$.\nArea of the octagon = area of square $BDEF$ - combined area of the four triangles.\n\n## Step 11: Perform the necessary calculations.\nArea of square $BDEF$ = $(2 + \\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 + 4\\sqrt{2} + 2 = 6 + 4\\sqrt{2}$.\nArea of one triangle = $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nCombined area of the four triangles = $4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 2$.\nArea of the octagon = $6 + 4\\sqrt{2} - 2 = 4 + 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4 + 4\\sqrt{2}}$"
