    "problem": "The surface area of a particular sphere is $324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2.\\]  Solving for $r$ and keeping the positive value yields $r^2=81$, so $r = 9$.  Hence the volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=81\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\pi = \\boxed{972\\pi}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the formula for the surface area of a sphere\nThe surface area of a sphere is given by the formula $4\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere.\n\n## Step 2: Use the given surface area to solve for the radius of the sphere\nGiven that the surface area of the sphere is $324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$, we can set up the equation $4\\pi r^2 = 324\\pi$ and solve for $r$. Dividing both sides by $4\\pi$, we get $r^2 = 81$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find $r = 9$.\n\n## Step 3: Recall the formula for the volume of a sphere\nThe volume of a sphere is given by the formula $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the volume of the sphere using the radius found in step 2\nSubstituting $r = 9$ into the volume formula, we get $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (9)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (729) = 972\\pi$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{972\\pi}$"
