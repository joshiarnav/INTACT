    "problem": "How many different triangles can be formed having a perimeter of 7 units if each side must have integral length?",
    "solution": "Let $a,b,$ and $c$ represent the three side lengths of the triangle. The perimeter is $a+b+c=7,$ so $b+c=7-a$. We know by the Triangle Inequality that the sum of two side lengths of a triangle must be greater than the third side length. If we focus on the variable $a$, we have\n\\[b+c>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 7-a>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 3.5>a.\\]We could easily replace $a$ with $b$ or $c$, so the maximum length of any of the three sides is $3$. If $a=3$, then $b+c=4$ and $b$ and $c$ could be $1$ and $3$ in some order or $2$ and $2$ in some order. If we let $a=2$ or $a=1$ and the maximum side length is $3$, we'll still end up with triangles of side lengths $(1,3,3)$ or $(2,2,3)$. There are $\\boxed{2}$ different triangles.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the triangle inequality theorem\nThe triangle inequality theorem states that for any triangle with sides of lengths a, b, and c, it must be true that a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a. This theorem will guide us in determining which combinations of side lengths can form valid triangles.\n\n## Step 2: List all possible combinations of integral side lengths that sum to 7\nGiven that the perimeter of the triangle is 7 units and each side must have an integral length, we can list all possible combinations of side lengths. These combinations include (1, 1, 5), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 3), and (2, 2, 3).\n\n## Step 3: Apply the triangle inequality theorem to each combination\nWe will apply the triangle inequality theorem to each of the combinations listed in Step 2 to determine which ones can form valid triangles.\n- For (1, 1, 5), 1 + 1 < 5, so this combination does not satisfy the triangle inequality.\n- For (1, 2, 4), 1 + 2 < 4, so this combination also does not satisfy the triangle inequality.\n- For (1, 3, 3), 1 + 3 > 3, 1 + 3 > 3, and 3 + 3 > 1, so this combination satisfies the triangle inequality.\n- For (2, 2, 3), 2 + 2 > 3, 2 + 3 > 2, and 2 + 3 > 2, so this combination also satisfies the triangle inequality.\n\n## Step 4: Count the valid combinations\nFrom Step 3, we identified two combinations that can form valid triangles: (1, 3, 3) and (2, 2, 3).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
