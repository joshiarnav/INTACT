    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  The problem involves finding the value of $AD \\div BC$ in simplest radical form, where $ABC$ and $BCD$ are equilateral triangles.\n## Step 2:  We can start by letting $s$ be the length of each side of the equilateral triangles. Then, $BC = s$.\n## Step 3:  To find the length of $AD$, we notice that it is the sum of the altitudes from $A$ and $D$ to $BC$. Each of these altitudes has a length of $s\\sqrt{3}/2$ due to the properties of equilateral triangles.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, $AD = s\\sqrt{3}$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we can calculate the value of $AD \\div BC$ by substituting the lengths we found earlier: $AD \\div BC = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{s}$.\n## Step 6:  Simplifying this expression gives us $AD \\div BC = \\sqrt{3}$.\n## Step 7:  So, the value of $AD \\div BC$ when expressed in simplest radical form is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}$"
