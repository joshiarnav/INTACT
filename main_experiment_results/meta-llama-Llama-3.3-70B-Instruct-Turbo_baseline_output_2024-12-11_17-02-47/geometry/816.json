    "problem": "A square sheet of paper has area $6 \\text{ cm}^2$. The front is white and the back is black. When the sheet is folded so that point $A$ rests on the diagonal as shown, the visible black area is equal to the visible white area. How many centimeters is $A$ from its original position? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the length of a leg of the black isosceles triangle.  Then the black area is $\\frac{1}{2}(x)(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x^2$.  The white area is $6-x^2$.  Solving $\\frac{1}{2}x^2=6-x^2$, we find $x^2=4$, so $x=2$.  The distance from A to its original position is the length of a hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs have length $x$.  Therefore, A is $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$ centimeters from its original position.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and visualize it\nWe have a square sheet of paper with an area of $6 \\text{ cm}^2$. The front side is white, and the back side is black. When folded along the diagonal, point $A$ rests on the diagonal, and the visible black area equals the visible white area. We are tasked with finding the distance of point $A$ from its original position after folding.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the area of the square\nGiven that the area of the square is $6 \\text{ cm}^2$, we can find the length of one side of the square by taking the square root of its area. Thus, the side length of the square is $\\sqrt{6} \\text{ cm}$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the black and white areas after folding\nWhen the sheet is folded, the black area is the triangle formed by the fold, and the white area is the remaining part of the square. Let $x$ be the length of a leg of the black triangle. The area of the black triangle is then $\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, and the area of the white portion is $6 - x^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Set up the equation based on the given condition\nThe visible black area is equal to the visible white area, so we can set up the equation $\\frac{1}{2}x^2 = 6 - x^2$ to find the value of $x$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the equation for $x$\nSolving the equation, we get $\\frac{1}{2}x^2 = 6 - x^2 \\implies \\frac{3}{2}x^2 = 6 \\implies x^2 = 4 \\implies x = 2$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the distance from $A$ to its original position\nThe distance from $A$ to its original position is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with leg lengths of $x$ (which is 2) and $x$ (which is also 2). Using the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is $\\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{8} = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$"
