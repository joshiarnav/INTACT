    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the greatest and least possible integral values of $x$, we need to apply the triangle inequality theorem.\nThe triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side.\n\n## Step 2: Let's denote the unknown side as $x$, and the other two sides as 5 and 6.\nWe can set up the inequalities based on the triangle inequality theorem: $x + 5 > 6$, $x + 6 > 5$, and $5 + 6 > x$.\n\n## Step 3: Solving the inequalities, we get $x > 1$, $x > -1$, and $x < 11$.\nSince $x$ must be greater than 1 and less than 11, the possible integral values of $x$ range from 2 to 10.\n\n## Step 4: The greatest possible integral value of $x$ is 10, and the least possible integral value of $x$ is 2.\nTo find the positive difference between the greatest and least possible integral values of $x$, we subtract the least value from the greatest value: $10 - 2 = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
