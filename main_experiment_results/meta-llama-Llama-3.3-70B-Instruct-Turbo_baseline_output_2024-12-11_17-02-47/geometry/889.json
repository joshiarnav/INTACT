    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, let's analyze the given figure and identify the key elements of the problem.\nWe have a rectangle $ABCD$ with $AB=12$ units, and $AZ=WC=6$ units. The area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is given as 120 square units. We are asked to find the area of triangle $BQW$.\n\n## Step 2: To start solving the problem, we need to find the length of the base of the trapezoid $ZWCD$, which is $CD$.\nSince $ABCD$ is a rectangle, $CD$ is equal to $AB$, which is 12 units.\n\n## Step 3: Next, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid to find the length of the top base $ZW$.\nThe area of a trapezoid is given by the formula: $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases and $h$ is the height. In this case, $b_1 = CD = 12$, $b_2 = ZW$, and $h = WC = 6$. We are given that the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is 120 square units. Substituting these values into the formula, we get $120 = \\frac{1}{2}(12 + ZW) \\times 6$. Solving for $ZW$, we find $ZW = 12 - 8 = 4$ units.\n\n## Step 4: Alternatively, we can also find the length of $ZW$ by using the fact that the area of the trapezoid $ZWCD$ is equal to the area of the rectangle $ABCD$ minus the areas of triangles $AZD$ and $BWC$.\nThe area of rectangle $ABCD$ is $12 \\times 20 = 240$ square units. The area of triangle $AZD$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 12 = 36$ square units. The area of triangle $BWC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 12 = 36$ square units. So, the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is $240 - 36 - 36 = 168$ square units. However, we are given that the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is 120 square units. This implies that the height of the trapezoid is not the full height of the rectangle, but rather $CD = 12$ and $ZW = 8$ units.\n\n## Step 5: Now, let's find the length of $QW$ and $QB$ to calculate the area of triangle $BQW$.\nSince $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$, $QW = \\frac{1}{2}ZW = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 = 4$ units. Similarly, $QB = \\frac{1}{2}AB = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6$ units.\n\n## Step 6: However, looking closely at the figure, we can see that triangle $BQW$ is similar to triangle $BWC$.\nAs $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$, $BQ$ is half of $BW$. Since $ZW = 8$ units and $WC = 6$ units, $BW = 20 - 6 - 8 = 6$ units. Therefore, $BQ = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 = 4$ units is incorrect. Instead, we should find the height of triangle $BQW$ using the similarity of triangles $BQW$ and $BWC$. The height of triangle $BWC$ is 6 units.\n\n## Step 7: Using the similarity of triangles $BQW$ and $BWC$, we can find the height of triangle $BQW$.\nThe ratio of the heights of the two triangles is equal to the ratio of their corresponding bases. Therefore, $\\frac{height\\ of\\ \\triangle BQW}{6} = \\frac{4}{12}$. Solving for the height of $\\triangle BQW$, we get $height\\ of\\ \\triangle BQW = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = 2$ units.\n\n## Step 8: Now, we can find the area of triangle $BQW$ using the formula for the area of a triangle.\nThe area of a triangle is given by the formula: $A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height. In this case, $b = QW = 4$ units and $h = 2 \\times 3 = 6$ units is incorrect. Instead, $h = 8$ units. However, $h = 8$ is also incorrect. Since $BQW$ is similar to $BWC$, the ratio of the areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, $\\frac{Area\\ of\\ \\triangle BQW}{Area\\ of\\ \\triangle BWC} = (\\frac{4}{12})^2$. We know that the area of $\\triangle BWC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 \\times 6 = 36$ square units.\n\n## Step 9: Using the ratio of the areas, we can find the area of triangle $BQW$.\n$\\frac{Area\\ of\\ \\triangle BQW}{36} = (\\frac{1}{3})^2$. Solving for the area of $\\triangle BQW$, we get $Area\\ of\\ \\triangle BQW = \\frac{1}{9} \\times 36 = 4$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
