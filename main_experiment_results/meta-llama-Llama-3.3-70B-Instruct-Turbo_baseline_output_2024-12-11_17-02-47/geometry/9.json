    "problem": "A round pizza is $\\frac13$ of an inch thick and has a diameter of 12 inches. It is cut into 12 congruent pieces. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one piece? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "The entire pizza has radius 6 inches and volume $\\pi (6^2)(1/3) = 12\\pi$ cubic inches.  One slice has 1/12th this volume, or $\\boxed{\\pi}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the radius of the pizza\nThe diameter of the pizza is given as 12 inches, so the radius is half of the diameter, which is $12 \\div 2 = 6$ inches.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the volume of the entire pizza\nThe formula for the volume of a cylinder is $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height (or thickness in this case). Given that the pizza is $\\frac13$ of an inch thick, the volume of the entire pizza is $V = \\pi (6)^2 \\left(\\frac13\\right) = \\pi (36) \\left(\\frac13\\right) = 12\\pi$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the volume of one piece of the pizza\nSince the pizza is cut into 12 congruent pieces, the volume of one piece is $\\frac{1}{12}$ of the volume of the entire pizza. Therefore, the volume of one piece is $\\frac{1}{12} \\times 12\\pi = \\pi$ cubic inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\pi}$"
