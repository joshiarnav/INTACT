    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the unit circle definition of cosine\nThe cosine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. However, for angles greater than 90 degrees, we use the unit circle to define cosine. In the unit circle, the cosine of an angle is the x-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the quadrant of the angle 240 degrees\nThe angle 240 degrees is in the third quadrant of the unit circle. In the third quadrant, the x-coordinate is negative and the y-coordinate is negative.\n\n## Step 3: Find the reference angle for 240 degrees\nTo find the cosine of 240 degrees, we need to find its reference angle. The reference angle is the acute angle between the terminal side of the angle and the x-axis. For 240 degrees, the reference angle is 60 degrees because 240 degrees is 180 degrees (which brings us to the opposite side of the unit circle) plus 60 degrees.\n\n## Step 4: Recall the cosine of the reference angle 60 degrees\nThe cosine of 60 degrees is 1/2. Since 240 degrees is in the third quadrant where cosine values are negative, the cosine of 240 degrees will be the negative of the cosine of 60 degrees.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the cosine of 240 degrees\nUsing the information from the previous steps, we can calculate the cosine of 240 degrees as the negative of the cosine of 60 degrees. So, $\\cos 240^\\circ = -\\cos 60^\\circ = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$"
