    "problem": "In trapezoid $ABCD$, the parallel sides $AB$ and $CD$ have lengths of 8 and 20 units, respectively, and the altitude is 12 units. Points $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of sides $AD$ and $BC$, respectively. What is the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ in square units?",
    "solution": "Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, quadrilateral $EFCD$ is a trapezoid with half the altitude of the original trapezoid (the altitude of trapezoid $EFCD$ is $12/2 = 6$). The length of base $CD$ is still $20$, but now we have to find the length of base $EF$. Since $EF$ connects the midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, its length is also the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$. Thus, $EF$ has length $\\frac{8+20}{2} = 14$. Finally, we can find the area of the trapezoid with the formula $\\text{Area} = a \\left(\\frac{b_1+b_2}{2}\\right)$ where $a$ is the altitude and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases. The area of trapezoid $EFCD $ is $6 \\left(\\frac{14+20}{2}\\right)=6 \\cdot 17 = \\boxed{102}$ square units.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the given information about trapezoid $ABCD$.\nThe trapezoid $ABCD$ has parallel sides $AB$ and $CD$ with lengths of 8 and 20 units, and the altitude is 12 units.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the properties of midpoints $E$ and $F$ in the trapezoid.\nPoints $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of sides $AD$ and $BC$, respectively. This means that quadrilateral $EFCD$ is also a trapezoid, and $EF$ is parallel to $AB$ and $CD$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the length of $EF$.\nSince $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, the length of $EF$ is the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$. Therefore, $EF = \\frac{AB + CD}{2} = \\frac{8 + 20}{2} = 14$ units.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the altitude of trapezoid $EFCD$.\nThe altitude of trapezoid $EFCD$ is half the altitude of the original trapezoid $ABCD$, because $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the legs. Thus, the altitude of $EFCD$ is $\\frac{12}{2} = 6$ units.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the formula for the area of a trapezoid to $EFCD$.\nThe formula for the area of a trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (a + b) \\times h$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the parallel sides and $h$ is the altitude. Substituting $EF$ and $CD$ for $a$ and $b$, and the altitude of $EFCD$ for $h$, we get: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (14 + 20) \\times 6$.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the arithmetic to find the area of $EFCD$.\nArea $= \\frac{1}{2} \\times 34 \\times 6 = 102$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{102}$"
