    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the quotient when $8x^3+16x^2-7x+4$ is divided by $2x+5$, we can use polynomial long division.\nWe start by dividing the highest degree term of the dividend by the highest degree term of the divisor.\n\n## Step 2: Divide $8x^3$ by $2x$ to get $4x^2$. This will be the first term of the quotient.\nNow, we multiply the entire divisor $2x+5$ by $4x^2$ to get $8x^3+20x^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Subtract $8x^3+20x^2$ from the original dividend $8x^3+16x^2-7x+4$ to get $-4x^2-7x+4$.\nNow, we bring down the next term, which is $-7x+4$, and repeat the process.\n\n## Step 4: Divide $-4x^2$ by $2x$ to get $-2x$. This will be the next term of the quotient.\nNow, we multiply the entire divisor $2x+5$ by $-2x$ to get $-4x^2-10x$.\n\n## Step 5: Subtract $-4x^2-10x$ from $-4x^2-7x+4$ to get $3x+4$.\nNow, we bring down the next term, which is $+4$, and repeat the process.\n\n## Step 6: Divide $3x$ by $2x$ to get $\\frac{3}{2}$. This will be the next term of the quotient.\nNow, we multiply the entire divisor $2x+5$ by $\\frac{3}{2}$ to get $3x+\\frac{15}{2}$.\n\n## Step 7: Subtract $3x+\\frac{15}{2}$ from $3x+4$ to get $-\\frac{7}{2}$.\nSince $-\\frac{7}{2}$ is a constant and cannot be divided by $2x$ to get a polynomial term, this is the remainder.\n\n## Step 8: Now, we combine the terms of the quotient: $4x^2-2x+\\frac{3}{2}$.\nThus, the quotient is $4x^2-2x+\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4x^2-2x+\\frac{3}{2}}$"
