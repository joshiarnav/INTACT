    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the given root and its complex conjugate\nThe given root is $-2 - i \\sqrt{5}$. Since the polynomial has real coefficients, the other root must be the complex conjugate of the given root, which is $-2 + i \\sqrt{5}$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the general form of a monic quadratic polynomial\nA monic quadratic polynomial in $x$ has the form $x^2 + bx + c$, where $b$ and $c$ are coefficients that we need to determine.\n\n## Step 3: Use the roots to form the factors of the polynomial\nGiven the roots $-2 - i \\sqrt{5}$ and $-2 + i \\sqrt{5}$, the factors of the polynomial are $(x - (-2 - i \\sqrt{5}))$ and $(x - (-2 + i \\sqrt{5}))$, which simplify to $(x + 2 + i \\sqrt{5})$ and $(x + 2 - i \\sqrt{5})$.\n\n## Step 4: Multiply the factors to obtain the polynomial\nTo find the polynomial, we multiply the factors: $(x + 2 + i \\sqrt{5})(x + 2 - i \\sqrt{5})$. Using the difference of squares formula $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$, this simplifies to $(x + 2)^2 - (i \\sqrt{5})^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression\nExpanding $(x + 2)^2$ gives $x^2 + 4x + 4$. Since $i^2 = -1$, $(i \\sqrt{5})^2 = -5$. Therefore, the polynomial simplifies to $x^2 + 4x + 4 - (-5)$, which further simplifies to $x^2 + 4x + 4 + 5$.\n\n## Step 6: Final simplification\nCombining like terms, we get $x^2 + 4x + 9$ as the monic quadratic polynomial.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{x^2 + 4x + 9}$"
