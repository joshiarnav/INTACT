    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the change of base formula for logarithms\nThe change of base formula for logarithms is $\\text{log}_b a = \\frac{\\text{log}_c a}{\\text{log}_c b}$ for any positive real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ where $c \\neq 1$. This formula allows us to express a logarithm in terms of another base.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the change of base formula to the given equation\nUsing the change of base formula, we can rewrite $\\frac{1}{\\text{log}_2a}$ as $\\frac{1}{\\frac{\\text{log}a}{\\text{log}2}} = \\frac{\\text{log}2}{\\text{log}a}$. Similarly, $\\frac{1}{\\text{log}_3a} = \\frac{\\text{log}3}{\\text{log}a}$ and $\\frac{1}{\\text{log}_4a} = \\frac{\\text{log}4}{\\text{log}a}$. Substituting these into the original equation gives $\\frac{\\text{log}2}{\\text{log}a} + \\frac{\\text{log}3}{\\text{log}a} + \\frac{\\text{log}4}{\\text{log}a} = 1$.\n\n## Step 3: Combine the fractions\nSince all the fractions have the same denominator, $\\text{log}a$, we can combine them into a single fraction: $\\frac{\\text{log}2 + \\text{log}3 + \\text{log}4}{\\text{log}a} = 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the property of logarithms to simplify the numerator\nThe sum of logarithms with the same base is equal to the logarithm of the product of the numbers inside the logarithms. Thus, $\\text{log}2 + \\text{log}3 + \\text{log}4 = \\text{log}(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4) = \\text{log}24$. Substituting this back into the equation gives $\\frac{\\text{log}24}{\\text{log}a} = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $a$\nTo solve for $a$, we can set $\\text{log}24 = \\text{log}a$ because the denominators are the same and the equation equals 1. This implies $a = 24$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$"
