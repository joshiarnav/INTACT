    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Observe the given equation\nThe equation given is $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) = [p(x)]^2 + 12$ for all real numbers $x.$ This equation involves a polynomial $p(x)$ and relates its values at different arguments.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the general form of $p(x)$\nSince $p(x)$ is a polynomial with real coefficients, we can express it as $p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n - 1} x^{n - 1} + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0,$ where $a_n \\neq 0$ unless $p(x)$ is the zero polynomial.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the degree of $p(x)$\nLet $n$ be the degree of $p(x).$ Then the degree of $p(x^3)$ is $3n,$ and the degree of $[p(x)]^2$ is $2n.$ For the given equation to hold, the degree of $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2)$ must be equal to the degree of $[p(x)]^2 + 12.$\n\n## Step 4: Equate the degrees of the polynomials\nThe degree of $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2)$ is $3n - 3$ if $n \\geq 1$ (since the leading term of $p(x^3)$ and the leading term of $p(x^3 - 2)$ cancel out when subtracted), and the degree of $[p(x)]^2 + 12$ is $2n.$ Thus, we have $3n - 3 = 2n,$ which implies $n = 3.$\n\n## Step 5: Express $p(x)$ as a cubic polynomial\nGiven that $n = 3,$ we express $p(x)$ as $p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d.$\n\n## Step 6: Substitute $p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ into the given equation\nBy substituting $p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ into the equation $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) = [p(x)]^2 + 12,$ we can solve for the coefficients $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$\n\n## Step 7: Expand $p(x^3)$ and $p(x^3 - 2)$\n$p(x^3) = ax^9 + bx^6 + cx^3 + d$ and $p(x^3 - 2) = a(x^3 - 2)^3 + b(x^3 - 2)^2 + c(x^3 - 2) + d = a(x^9 - 6x^6 + 12x^3 - 8) + b(x^6 - 4x^3 + 4) + cx^3 - 2c + d.$\n\n## Step 8: Calculate $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2)$\n$p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) = ax^9 + bx^6 + cx^3 + d - (ax^9 - 6ax^6 + 12ax^3 - 8a + bx^6 - 4bx^3 + 4b + cx^3 - 2c + d) = 6ax^6 - 11ax^3 + 8a - 4bx^3 + 4b + 2c.$\n\n## Step 9: Expand $[p(x)]^2 + 12$\n$[p(x)]^2 + 12 = (ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)^2 + 12 = a^2x^6 + 2abx^5 + (2ac + b^2)x^4 + (2ad + 2bc)x^3 + (2bd + c^2)x^2 + (2cd)x + d^2 + 12.$\n\n## Step 10: Equate coefficients\nEquate the coefficients of $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2)$ and $[p(x)]^2 + 12.$\n\n## Step 11: Solve the system of equations\nThe coefficients of the $x^6$ terms give $6a = a^2,$ so $a = 0$ or $a = 6.$ The constant terms give $8a + 4b + 2c = d^2 + 12.$\n\n## Step 12: Consider $a = 0$\nIf $a = 0,$ then the equation $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) = [p(x)]^2 + 12$ simplifies, and we find that $b = c = d = 0$ (since there are no terms to cancel out the $x^2,$ $x,$ and constant terms on the right-hand side). However, $a = 0$ and $b = c = d = 0$ imply that $p(x) = 0,$ which does not satisfy the original equation.\n\n## Step 13: Consider $a = 6$\nIf $a = 6,$ then we have $6 \\cdot 6 = 36 = a^2.$ We then equate the coefficients of $x^5,$ $x^4,$ $x^3,$ $x^2,$ and $x$ to find $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$ The $x^5$ term gives $2ab = 0,$ so $b = 0.$ The $x^4$ term gives $2ac + b^2 = 0,$ which implies $c = 0$ since $b = 0.$ The $x^3$ term gives $6 \\cdot 6 - 11 \\cdot 6 = 2ad + 2bc,$ which simplifies to $-30 = 2ad$ (since $b = c = 0$), so $d = -15.$ The $x^2$ and $x$ terms give $2bd + c^2 = 0$ and $2cd = 0,$ respectively, both of which are satisfied when $b = c = 0$ and $d = -15.$ Finally, the constant term gives $8 \\cdot 6 + 4 \\cdot 0 + 2 \\cdot 0 = (-15)^2 + 12,$ which holds.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6x^3 - 15}$"
