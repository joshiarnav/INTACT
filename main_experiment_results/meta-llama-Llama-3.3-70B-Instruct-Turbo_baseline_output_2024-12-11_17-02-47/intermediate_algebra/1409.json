    "solution": "Let $y$ be a number in the range of $f.$ This means that there is a real number $x$ such that \\[y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}.\\]Multiplying both sides by $x^2-x+1$ and rearranging, we get the equation \\[yx^2-(y+1)x+y=0.\\]Since $x^2-x+1 = (x-\\tfrac12)^2 + \\tfrac34 > 0$ for all $x,$ our steps are reversible, so $y$ is in the range of $f$ if and only if this equation has a real solution for $x.$ In turn, this equation has a real solution for $x$ if and only if the discriminant of this quadratic is nonnegative. Therefore, the range of $f$ consists exactly of the values of $y$ which satisfy \\[(y+1)^2 - 4y^2 \\ge 0,\\]or \\[0 \\ge 3y^2 - 2y - 1.\\]This quadratic factors as \\[0 \\ge (3y+1)(y-1),\\]which means that the solutions to the inequality are given by $-\\tfrac13 \\le y \\le 1.$ Therefore, the range of $g$ is the closed interval $\\boxed{[-\\tfrac13, 1]}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Analyze the given function\nThe function given is $f(x) = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}$. To find the range, we need to determine all possible output values ($y$) that this function can produce for any real number input ($x$).\n\n## Step 2: Set up the equation to find the range\nTo find the range, we set $y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}$ and solve for $x$ in terms of $y$. This will help us understand what values $y$ can take.\n\n## Step 3: Rearrange the equation\nStarting with $y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}$, we can rearrange this equation to get it in terms of $x$. Multiply both sides by $x^2-x+1$ to get $y(x^2-x+1) = x$. This simplifies to $yx^2 - yx + y = x$.\n\n## Step 4: Further simplification\nRearranging the terms gives us $yx^2 - (y + 1)x + y = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$, with $y$ as a parameter.\n\n## Step 5: Condition for real solutions\nFor the equation $yx^2 - (y + 1)x + y = 0$ to have real solutions for $x$, its discriminant must be non-negative. The discriminant is given by the formula $D = b^2 - 4ac$, where $a = y$, $b = -(y + 1)$, and $c = y$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the discriminant\nSubstituting $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the discriminant formula gives $D = [-(y + 1)]^2 - 4(y)(y) = (y + 1)^2 - 4y^2 = y^2 + 2y + 1 - 4y^2 = -3y^2 + 2y + 1$.\n\n## Step 7: Set up the inequality for the discriminant\nFor real solutions, the discriminant $D = -3y^2 + 2y + 1 \\geq 0$. We need to solve this inequality for $y$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the quadratic inequality\nTo solve $-3y^2 + 2y + 1 \\geq 0$, we can first find the roots of the equation $-3y^2 + 2y + 1 = 0$ by using the quadratic formula $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = -3$, $b = 2$, and $c = 1$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the roots\nThe roots are given by $y = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(-3)(1)}}{2(-3)} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 12}}{-6} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{16}}{-6} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 4}{-6}$. So, $y = \\frac{-2 + 4}{-6} = \\frac{2}{-6} = -\\frac{1}{3}$ or $y = \\frac{-2 - 4}{-6} = \\frac{-6}{-6} = 1$.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the intervals for the inequality\nThe inequality $-3y^2 + 2y + 1 \\geq 0$ will be true for values of $y$ between the roots $-1/3$ and $1$, because the coefficient of $y^2$ is negative, meaning the parabola opens downwards. Thus, the solution to the inequality is $-1/3 \\leq y \\leq 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[-\\frac{1}{3}, 1]}$"
