    "problem": "The domain of the function $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$ is $[0,\\infty)$. What is the range?",
    "solution": "We have $q(x) = (x^2+2)^2$. We wish to determine the set of all $y$ for which $q(x)=y$ has solutions. We must have $y\\ge 0$, since $q(x)$ is a square and squares are nonnegative. Under the assumption $y\\ge 0$, we have:\n$$\\begin{array}{r r@{~=~}l}\n& y & (x^2+2)^2 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & \\sqrt y & x^2+2 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & \\sqrt y-2 & x^2 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$We see that $\\sqrt y-2\\ge 0$ because squares are nonnegative. Thus, we need $y\\ge 4$. When $y\\ge 4$, we have $y=q(x)$ by setting $x$ equal to either of $\\pm \\sqrt{\\sqrt y-2}$, and so any $y\\ge 4$ can be achieved.\n\nTherefore, the range of $q(x)$ is $\\boxed{[4,\\infty)}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given function and its domain\nThe function given is $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$, and its domain is specified as $[0,\\infty)$. This means we're only considering non-negative values of $x$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the structure of the function\nThe function $q(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4. It can be rewritten as $q(x) = (x^2 + 2)^2$, which is a perfect square. Since $x^2 + 2$ will always be positive for $x$ in the domain $[0,\\infty)$, and the square of any real number is non-negative, the minimum value of $q(x)$ occurs when $x=0$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the minimum value of the function\nSubstitute $x=0$ into the function: $q(0) = 0^4 + 4(0)^2 + 4 = 4$. This is the minimum value of the function within its domain.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the behavior of the function as $x$ increases\nAs $x$ increases from $0$ to $\\infty$, $x^2$ increases, and thus $x^4$ increases even faster. This means $q(x)$ will increase without bound as $x$ gets larger.\n\n## Step 5: Conclude the range of the function\nSince the minimum value of $q(x)$ is 4 and $q(x)$ increases without bound as $x$ increases, the range of $q(x)$ is all real numbers greater than or equal to 4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[4,\\infty)}$"
