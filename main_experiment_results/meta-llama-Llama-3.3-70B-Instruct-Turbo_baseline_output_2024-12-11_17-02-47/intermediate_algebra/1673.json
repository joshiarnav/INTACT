    "problem": "If $a$ is a nonzero integer and $b$ is a positive number such that $ab^2=\\log_{10} b$, what is the median of the set $\\{0, 1, a, b,\n1/b\\}$?",
    "solution": "Because $b<10^b$ for all $b>0$, it follows that $\\log_{10}b<b$.  If $b\\geq 1$, then $0<\\left(\\log_{10}b\\right)/b^2<1$, so $a$ cannot be an integer. Therefore $0<b<1$, so $\\log_{10}b<0$ and $a =\n\\left(\\log_{10}b\\right)/b^2<0$.  Thus $a<0<b<1<1/b$, and the median of the set is $\\boxed{b}$.\n\nNote that the conditions of the problem can be met with $b = 0.1$ and $a = -100$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the equation given\nThe equation $ab^2=\\log_{10} b$ tells us that $b$ must be greater than 0 and not equal to 1, because $\\log_{10} 1 = 0$ and $ab^2$ would be 0, which contradicts the fact that $a$ is a nonzero integer.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the possible range of $b$\nSince $b$ is positive and $b \\neq 1$, and considering the nature of the logarithmic function, $b$ must be greater than 1 for the equation to hold true because $ab^2$ needs to be positive to equal $\\log_{10} b$.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the value of $1/b$\nGiven that $b > 1$, $1/b$ must be less than 1.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the order of the set\nKnowing that $b > 1$ and $1/b < 1$, and considering the elements of the set $\\{0, 1, a, b, 1/b\\}$, we can start to order them. $0$ is the smallest, and $1/b$ will be between $0$ and $1$. $b$ will be greater than $1$. The value of $a$ is unknown but since it's an integer, it could be anywhere in the order.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the possible values of $a$\nHowever, because $ab^2 = \\log_{10} b$, and given that $b > 1$, $\\log_{10} b > 0$. This means $a$ must be positive because $b^2$ is positive, and the product $ab^2$ must be positive.\n\n## Step 6: Final ordering and median determination\nGiven that $0 < 1/b < 1 < b$, and knowing $a$ is a positive integer, $a$ could be 1 or greater. If $a = 1$, the set becomes $\\{0, 1/b, 1, b\\}$ or $\\{0, 1, 1/b, b\\}$ depending on the exact value of $1/b$. If $a > 1$, then $a$ would be between $1$ and $b$ or greater than $b$. However, the median of the set $\\{0, 1, a, b, 1/b\\}$, given that $0 < 1/b < 1 < b$ and $a$ is a positive integer, will be $b$ because regardless of the exact value of $a$, the middle value when the set is ordered will be $b$ since $a$'s position can vary but $b$ remains greater than 1 and $1/b$ is less than 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{b}$"
