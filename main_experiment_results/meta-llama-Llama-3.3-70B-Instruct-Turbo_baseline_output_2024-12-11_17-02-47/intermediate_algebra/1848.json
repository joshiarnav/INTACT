    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the given root and its implications\nGiven that $2+\\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the equation $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10 = 0$, and knowing that the coefficients $a$ and $b$ are rational, we recognize that the radical conjugate of $2+\\sqrt{3}$, which is $2-\\sqrt{3}$, must also be a root of the equation. This is because, for a polynomial with rational coefficients, irrational roots always come in conjugate pairs.\n\n## Step 2: Find the third root using Vieta's formulas\nAccording to Vieta's formulas, for a cubic equation $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ with roots $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$, the sum of the roots equals $-a$, the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time equals $b$, and the product of the roots equals $-c$. Since we know two of the roots are $2+\\sqrt{3}$ and $2-\\sqrt{3}$, and the constant term $c = 10$, we can find the third root. The product of the roots is $-10$, so $(2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3})(r_3) = -10$. Simplifying $(2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3})$ gives $1$, so $r_3 = -10$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Vieta's formulas to find $b$\nNow, knowing all three roots ($2+\\sqrt{3}$, $2-\\sqrt{3}$, and $-10$), we can apply Vieta's formula to find $b$. The formula states that $b$ equals the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time. So, $b = (2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3}) + (2+\\sqrt{3})(-10) + (2-\\sqrt{3})(-10)$. Simplifying, $(2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3}) = 1$ (from the difference of squares formula $(a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2$), and the other two products are $-10(2+\\sqrt{3})$ and $-10(2-\\sqrt{3})$. Thus, $b = 1 - 10(2+\\sqrt{3}) - 10(2-\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression for $b$\nSimplifying $b = 1 - 10(2+\\sqrt{3}) - 10(2-\\sqrt{3})$, we get $b = 1 - 10(2+\\sqrt{3} + 2 - \\sqrt{3})$ because the $\\sqrt{3}$ terms cancel out when added together. This further simplifies to $b = 1 - 10(4)$, since $2+\\sqrt{3} + 2 - \\sqrt{3} = 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the final value of $b$\nFinally, calculating $b = 1 - 10(4)$ gives $b = 1 - 40$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-39}$"
