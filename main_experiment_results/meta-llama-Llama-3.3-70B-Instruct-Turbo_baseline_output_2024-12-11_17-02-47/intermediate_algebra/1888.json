    "problem": "A parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is reflected about the $x$-axis. The parabola and its reflection are translated horizontally five units in opposite directions to become the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$, respectively. Which of the following describes the graph of $y=(f+g)(x)$?\n\n(A) a parabola tangent to the $x$-axis\n(B) a parabola not tangent to the $x$-axis\n(C) a horizontal line\n(D) a non-horizontal line\n(E) the graph of a cubic function",
    "solution": "Write the equation of the original parabola as $y = a(x - h)^2 + k,$ where $a \\neq 0.$  Then the equation of the reflected parabola is\n\\[y = -a(x - h)^2 - k.\\]When the parabolas are translated horizontally by 5 units, in opposite directions, their equations become\n\\[y = a(x - h \\pm 5)^2 + k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -a(x - h \\mp 5)^2 - k.\\]The sum of these expressions is\n\\[\\pm 20ax \\mp 20ah = \\pm 20a (x - h),\\]which is the equation of a non-horizontal line.  The answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(D)}}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given information\nThe original parabola has the equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$. When reflected about the $x$-axis, its equation becomes $y = -ax^2 - bx - c$.\n\n## Step 2: Translate the parabolas horizontally\nThe original parabola is translated 5 units to the right, so its equation becomes $y = a(x - 5)^2 + b(x - 5) + c$. The reflected parabola is translated 5 units to the left, so its equation becomes $y = -a(x + 5)^2 - b(x + 5) - c$.\n\n## Step 3: Express the translated parabolas in terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$\nLet $f(x) = a(x - 5)^2 + b(x - 5) + c$ and $g(x) = -a(x + 5)^2 - b(x + 5) - c$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the sum $(f+g)(x)$\nTo find the sum $(f+g)(x)$, we add the expressions for $f(x)$ and $g(x)$:\n$(f+g)(x) = a(x - 5)^2 + b(x - 5) + c - a(x + 5)^2 - b(x + 5) - c$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression for $(f+g)(x)$\nExpanding the terms in the expression:\n$(f+g)(x) = a(x^2 - 10x + 25) + b(x - 5) + c - a(x^2 + 10x + 25) - b(x + 5) - c$.\nSimplifying further:\n$(f+g)(x) = ax^2 - 10ax + 25a + bx - 5b + c - ax^2 - 10ax - 25a - bx - 5b - c$.\nCombining like terms:\n$(f+g)(x) = -20ax - 10b$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the nature of the graph of $(f+g)(x)$\nThe expression $(f+g)(x) = -20ax - 10b$ represents a linear equation, which is a non-horizontal line unless $a = 0$, but since $a$ is part of the original parabola equation, we consider the general case where $a$ is not necessarily zero. Thus, the graph of $y = (f+g)(x)$ is a non-horizontal line.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(D)}$"
