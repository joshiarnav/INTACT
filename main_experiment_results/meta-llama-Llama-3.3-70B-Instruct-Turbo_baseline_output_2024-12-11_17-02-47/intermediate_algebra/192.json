    "problem": "For which value of $x$ does the function $f(x) = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}$ cross its horizontal asymptote?",
    "solution": "The horizontal asymptote of $f$ is the horizontal line that $f$ approaches as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. When the leading terms of the numerator and denominator have the same degree, that line is at the value equal to the ratio of the leading coefficients, namely $y = 2/1 = 2$. Setting this equal to $f(x)$, $$f(x) = 2 = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}.$$Clearing the denominator, $$2(x^2 - 4x + 1) = 2x^2 - 8x + 2 = 2x^2 - 5x - 7 \\Longrightarrow 3x = 9 \\Longrightarrow x = \\boxed{3}.$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Find the horizontal asymptote of the function\nTo find the horizontal asymptote, we compare the degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and the denominator. Since both have the same degree (degree 2), the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients of the numerator and the denominator. For $f(x) = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}$, the leading coefficients are 2 and 1, respectively. Thus, the horizontal asymptote is $y = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$.\n\n## Step 2: Set the function equal to its horizontal asymptote\nTo find where $f(x)$ crosses its horizontal asymptote, we set $f(x)$ equal to 2 and solve for $x$. This gives us the equation $\\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1} = 2$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the equation for $x$\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $x^2 - 4x + 1$ to clear the denominator gives $2x^2 - 5x - 7 = 2(x^2 - 4x + 1)$. Simplifying this equation, we get $2x^2 - 5x - 7 = 2x^2 - 8x + 2$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify and solve for $x$\nSubtracting $2x^2$ from both sides of the equation gives $-5x - 7 = -8x + 2$. Adding $8x$ to both sides gives $3x - 7 = 2$. Adding 7 to both sides gives $3x = 9$. Dividing both sides by 3 gives $x = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
