    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the Complex Conjugate Root Theorem\nThe Complex Conjugate Root Theorem states that if a polynomial equation with real coefficients has a complex root, then its conjugate is also a root of the polynomial. Therefore, if $-2 - 3i$ is a root, then $-2 + 3i$ must also be a root.\n\n## Step 2: Form the quadratic equation having the given roots\nUsing the roots $-2 - 3i$ and $-2 + 3i$, we can form a quadratic equation that has these roots. The product of the roots is $(-2 - 3i)(-2 + 3i) = (-2)^2 - (3i)^2 = 4 - 9i^2 = 4 + 9 = 13$. The sum of the roots is $(-2 - 3i) + (-2 + 3i) = -4$. Thus, the quadratic equation is $x^2 + 4x + 13 = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the quadratic equation to help factor the cubic polynomial\nWe know that the cubic polynomial $ax^3 + 3x^2 + bx - 65$ must be divisible by $x^2 + 4x + 13$ since both $-2 - 3i$ and $-2 + 3i$ are roots of the cubic polynomial. So, we can write $ax^3 + 3x^2 + bx - 65 = (x^2 + 4x + 13)(cx + d)$ for some constants $c$ and $d$.\n\n## Step 4: Expand and equate coefficients\nExpanding $(x^2 + 4x + 13)(cx + d)$ gives $cx^3 + (4c + d)x^2 + (13c + 4d)x + 13d$. Equating coefficients of like powers of $x$ with the cubic polynomial $ax^3 + 3x^2 + bx - 65$, we get the following system of equations:\n- $a = c$\n- $3 = 4c + d$\n- $b = 13c + 4d$\n- $-65 = 13d$\n\n## Step 5: Solve the system of equations for $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$\nFrom the last equation, $-65 = 13d$, we find $d = -5$. Substituting $d = -5$ into the second equation, $3 = 4c + d$, gives $3 = 4c - 5$, so $4c = 8$ and $c = 2$. Since $a = c$, we have $a = 2$. Finally, substituting $c = 2$ and $d = -5$ into the third equation, $b = 13c + 4d$, yields $b = 13(2) + 4(-5) = 26 - 20 = 6$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the real root of the cubic polynomial\nNow that we know $a = 2$, $b = 6$, and the quadratic factor $x^2 + 4x + 13$, we can write the cubic polynomial as $2x^3 + 3x^2 + 6x - 65 = (x^2 + 4x + 13)(2x - 5)$. Thus, the real root of the cubic polynomial is found by setting $2x - 5 = 0$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$"
