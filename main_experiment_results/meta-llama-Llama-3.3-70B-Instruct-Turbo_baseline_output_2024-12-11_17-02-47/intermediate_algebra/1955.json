    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To solve the given equation, let's first isolate one of the radicals to simplify the equation.\nWe start with the equation \\[\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + \\sqrt{x - 1} = 1.\\] Let's isolate $\\sqrt{x - 1}$ by moving $\\sqrt[3]{2 - x}$ to the other side of the equation: \\[\\sqrt{x - 1} = 1 - \\sqrt[3]{2 - x}.\\]\n\n## Step 2: Next, to remove the square root, we'll square both sides of the equation.\nSquaring both sides gives us: \\[(\\sqrt{x - 1})^2 = (1 - \\sqrt[3]{2 - x})^2.\\] This simplifies to: \\[x - 1 = 1 - 2\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + (\\sqrt[3]{2 - x})^2.\\]\n\n## Step 3: We should simplify and rearrange the equation to make it easier to solve.\nLet's simplify and rearrange the terms: \\[x - 1 = 1 - 2\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + (2 - x)^{2/3}.\\] This can be further simplified to: \\[x - 2 = -2\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + (2 - x)^{2/3}.\\] Let's make a substitution to simplify the equation further: let $y = \\sqrt[3]{2 - x}$, which means $y^3 = 2 - x$ or $x = 2 - y^3$. Substituting $x$ in the equation gives us: \\[2 - y^3 - 2 = -2y + y^2.\\]\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation after substitution.\nSimplifying, we get: \\[-y^3 = -2y + y^2.\\] Rearranging gives us: \\[y^3 - y^2 + 2y = 0.\\] Factoring out a $y$, we get: \\[y(y^2 - y + 2) = 0.\\] The quadratic part $y^2 - y + 2$ does not have real roots since the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac = (-1)^2 - 4(1)(2) = 1 - 8 = -7$ is negative, meaning it has complex roots. Thus, the only real solution for $y$ is when $y = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $x$ using the value of $y$.\nSince $y = \\sqrt[3]{2 - x} = 0$, solving for $x$ gives us: \\[2 - x = 0^3 = 0.\\] Therefore, $x = 2$.\n\n## Step 6: Check if the solution satisfies the original equation.\nPlugging $x = 2$ back into the original equation to check for validity: \\[\\sqrt[3]{2 - 2} + \\sqrt{2 - 1} = \\sqrt[3]{0} + \\sqrt{1} = 0 + 1 = 1.\\] This confirms that $x = 2$ is indeed a solution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
