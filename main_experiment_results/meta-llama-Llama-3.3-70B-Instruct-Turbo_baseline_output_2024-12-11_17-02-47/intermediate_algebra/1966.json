    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the geometric sequence terms\nGiven that $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $a_3$ are the first three terms of a geometric sequence and $a_1 = 1$, we can express $a_2$ and $a_3$ in terms of the common ratio $r$. In a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by $r$. Thus, $a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r$ and $a_3 = a_2 \\cdot r = a_1 \\cdot r^2$.\n\n## Step 2: Express $a_2$ and $a_3$ in terms of $r$\nSince $a_1 = 1$, we have $a_2 = 1 \\cdot r = r$ and $a_3 = 1 \\cdot r^2 = r^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate the expression $4a_2 + 5a_3$ in terms of $r$\nSubstitute $a_2 = r$ and $a_3 = r^2$ into the expression $4a_2 + 5a_3$ to get $4r + 5r^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the minimum value of $4r + 5r^2$\nTo find the minimum value of the quadratic expression $4r + 5r^2$, we can complete the square or use calculus. The expression can be rewritten as $5(r^2 + \\frac{4}{5}r)$. Completing the square gives $5(r^2 + \\frac{4}{5}r + \\frac{4}{25}) - \\frac{4}{5}$, which simplifies to $5(r + \\frac{2}{5})^2 - \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the minimum value\nThe minimum value of $5(r + \\frac{2}{5})^2 - \\frac{4}{5}$ occurs when $(r + \\frac{2}{5})^2 = 0$, which means $r = -\\frac{2}{5}$. Substituting $r = -\\frac{2}{5}$ back into the expression gives the minimum value: $5(0) - \\frac{4}{5} = -\\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}}$"
