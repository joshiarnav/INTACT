    "model_solution": "## Step 1: We start by assuming that $\\sqrt{37-20\\sqrt3} = a-b\\sqrt3$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers.\nThis assumption is based on the form of the expression inside the square root, which involves both rational and irrational components.\n\n## Step 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\n$(\\sqrt{37-20\\sqrt3})^2 = (a-b\\sqrt3)^2$ simplifies to $37-20\\sqrt3 = (a^2+3b^2) - 2ab\\sqrt3$.\n\n## Step 3: Equate the coefficients of the rational and irrational parts on both sides of the equation.\nEquating the rational parts gives $37 = a^2+3b^2$, and equating the irrational parts gives $-20 = -2ab$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the system of equations obtained in step 3.\nFrom $-20 = -2ab$, we can solve for $ab = 10$. We need to find integers $a$ and $b$ whose product is 10. Possible pairs are (1,10), (10,1), (2,5), and (5,2).\n\n## Step 5: Test these pairs in the equation $37 = a^2+3b^2$ to find the correct values of $a$ and $b$.\nFor (1,10), $1^2 + 3*10^2 = 1 + 300 = 301$, which is not equal to 37.\nFor (10,1), $10^2 + 3*1^2 = 100 + 3 = 103$, which is not equal to 37.\nFor (2,5), $2^2 + 3*5^2 = 4 + 75 = 79$, which is not equal to 37.\nFor (5,2), $5^2 + 3*2^2 = 25 + 12 = 37$, which matches our target.\n\n## Step 6: Identify $a$ and $b$ from step 5 that satisfy both equations.\n$a=5$ and $b=2$ satisfy both $ab=10$ and $a^2+3b^2=37$.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute $a$ and $b$ back into the expression $a-b\\sqrt3$ to find the simplified form of $\\sqrt{37-20\\sqrt3}$.\n$\\sqrt{37-20\\sqrt3} = 5 - 2\\sqrt3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5-2\\sqrt3}$"
