    "problem": "One of the asymptotes of a hyperbola has equation $y=3x.$ The foci of the hyperbola have the same $x-$coordinate, which is $5.$ Find the equation of the other asymptote of the hyperbola, giving your answer in the form \"$y = mx + b$\".",
    "solution": "Because the foci both lie on the line $x=5$ and the center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the segment connecting the foci, the center must also lie on the line $x=5.$ However, we also know that the asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at the center. Therefore, the center of the hyperbola lies on both the line $x=5$ and the line $y=3x,$ so its coordinates are $(5, 15).$\n\nBecause the hyperbola has a horizontal axis, the other asymptote must have slope $-3.$ Therefore, we can write a point-slope equation for the other asymptote: \\[y - 15 = -3(x - 5),\\]which is equivalent to $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the equation of the other asymptote of the hyperbola, we first need to understand the properties of hyperbolas and their asymptotes.\nA hyperbola is defined as the set of all points such that the absolute value of the difference between the distances from two fixed points (foci) is constant. The asymptotes of a hyperbola intersect at its center and are given by the equations $y = \\pm \\frac{b}{a}x$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Since the foci of the hyperbola have the same $x-$coordinate, which is $5$, the center of the hyperbola must also lie on this vertical line.\nThe center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the line segment joining the two foci. Since the foci have the same $x-$coordinate, the $x-$coordinate of the center is also $5$.\n\n## Step 3: The given asymptote $y=3x$ passes through the center of the hyperbola.\nSince the center of the hyperbola lies on the line $x=5$, we can substitute $x=5$ into the equation of the given asymptote to find the $y-$coordinate of the center. $y = 3 \\times 5 = 15$.\n\n## Step 4: The center of the hyperbola is $(5, 15)$.\nNow that we have the coordinates of the center, we can use the fact that the asymptotes of a hyperbola are symmetric with respect to the center.\n\n## Step 5: The other asymptote must have a slope of $-3$ since the slopes of the asymptotes are negatives of each other.\nThe equation of the other asymptote can be written as $y = -3x + b$. To find $b$, we can use the fact that the asymptote passes through the center of the hyperbola.\n\n## Step 6: Substituting the coordinates of the center into the equation of the other asymptote, we get $15 = -3 \\times 5 + b$.\nSolving for $b$, we have $15 = -15 + b$, so $b = 30$.\n\n## Step 7: The equation of the other asymptote is $y = -3x + 30$.\nThis is the required equation of the other asymptote of the hyperbola.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}$"
