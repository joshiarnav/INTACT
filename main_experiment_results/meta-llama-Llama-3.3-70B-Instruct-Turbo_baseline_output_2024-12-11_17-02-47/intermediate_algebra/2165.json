    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the remainder when a polynomial is divided by another polynomial, we can use polynomial long division or the remainder theorem.\nThe remainder theorem states that if a polynomial f(x) is divided by (x - a), the remainder is f(a). In this case, since we're dividing by 2x - 6, we first need to express it in the form (x - a), which gives us 2(x - 3). Thus, a = 3.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute x = 3 into the polynomial $6x^4-14x^3-4x^2+2x-26$ to find the remainder.\nWe calculate $6(3)^4 - 14(3)^3 - 4(3)^2 + 2(3) - 26$.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the arithmetic calculation.\n$6(3)^4 = 6 * 81 = 486$,\n$14(3)^3 = 14 * 27 = 378$,\n$4(3)^2 = 4 * 9 = 36$,\n$2(3) = 6$.\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation: $486 - 378 - 36 + 6 - 26$.\n\n## Step 4: Complete the arithmetic to find the remainder.\n$486 - 378 = 108$,\n$108 - 36 = 72$,\n$72 + 6 = 78$,\n$78 - 26 = 52$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{52}$"
