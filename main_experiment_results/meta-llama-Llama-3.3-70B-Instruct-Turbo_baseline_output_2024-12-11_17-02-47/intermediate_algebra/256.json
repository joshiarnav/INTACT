First, let's simplify the equations to make the system easier to solve.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equations\nFrom the equation for $n = 1$, we have $d = 1 - a - b - c$.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute $d$ into the other equations\nSubstituting $d$ into the equations for $n = 2, 3,$ and $4$ gives us:\n- For $n = 2$: $8a + 4b + 2c + 1 - a - b - c = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- For $n = 3$: $27a + 9b + 3c + 1 - a - b - c = \\frac{1}{9}$\n- For $n = 4$: $64a + 16b + 4c + 1 - a - b - c = \\frac{1}{16}$\n\n## Step 6: Simplify these equations further\n- For $n = 2$: $7a + 3b + c = -\\frac{3}{4}$\n- For $n = 3$: $26a + 8b + 2c = -\\frac{8}{9}$\n- For $n = 4$: $63a + 15b + 3c = -\\frac{15}{16}$\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$\nWe can solve this system of equations for $a$, $b$, and $c$ using methods like substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination in the next steps.\n\n## Step 8: Eliminate $c$ from the equations\nMultiplying the equation for $n = 2$ by $2$ and the equation for $n = 3$ by $-1$ gives:\n- $14a + 6b + 2c = -\\frac{3}{2}$\n- $-26a - 8b - 2c = \\frac{8}{9}$\n\nAdding these two equations eliminates $c$:\n$-12a - 2b = -\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{8}{9}$\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the result of eliminating $c$\n$-12a - 2b = -\\frac{27}{18} + \\frac{16}{18} = -\\frac{11}{18}$\n\n## Step 10: Solve for $a$ and $b$\nWe need another equation that involves just $a$ and $b$. Let's eliminate $c$ from the equations for $n = 2$ and $n = 4$:\n- For $n = 2$: $7a + 3b + c = -\\frac{3}{4}$\n- For $n = 4$: $63a + 15b + 3c = -\\frac{15}{16}$\n\nMultiplying the first equation by $3$ and the second by $-1$:\n- $21a + 9b + 3c = -\\frac{9}{4}$\n- $-63a - 15b - 3c = \\frac{15}{16}$\n\nAdding these equations:\n$-42a - 6b = -\\frac{9}{4} + \\frac{15}{16}$\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the new equation\n$-42a - 6b = -\\frac{36}{16} + \\frac{15}{16} = -\\frac{21}{16}$\n\n## Step 12: Solve the system of equations for $a$ and $b$\nNow we have two equations:\n- $-12a - 2b = -\\frac{11}{18}$\n- $-42a - 6b = -\\frac{21}{16}$\n\nWe can simplify these equations to make them easier to solve.\n\n## Step 13: Multiply the first equation to make the coefficients of $b$ equal\nMultiplying the first equation by $3$ gives:\n$-36a - 6b = -\\frac{11}{6}$\n\n## Step 14: Subtract the second equation from this new equation\n$-36a - 6b - (-42a - 6b) = -\\frac{11}{6} - (-\\frac{21}{16})$\n\n## Step 15: Solve for $a$\n$6a = -\\frac{11}{6} + \\frac{21}{16}$\n\n## Step 16: Find a common denominator and simplify\n$6a = -\\frac{11*16}{6*16} + \\frac{21*6}{16*6} = -\\frac{176}{96} + \\frac{126}{96} = -\\frac{50}{96}$\n\n## Step 17: Simplify $a$\n$a = -\\frac{50}{96*6} = -\\frac{50}{576}$\n\n## Step 18: Solve for $b$\nSubstitute $a$ back into one of the simplified equations to solve for $b$.\n\n## Step 19: Calculation of $b$ is complex and prone to error, let's reconsider our approach\nGiven the complexity of manually solving this system of equations and the propensity for arithmetic mistakes, a more efficient approach would involve using a matrix or a computational tool to find $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. However, since we need to follow the format to the letter and provide a step-by-step solution, let's simplify our strategy by directly evaluating $p(5)$ using the method of differences or another suitable method for cubic polynomials, acknowledging that direct computation might be challenging without computational tools.\n\n## Step 20: Consider an alternative approach using the method of differences or Lagrange interpolation\nGiven the cubic polynomial and its values at four distinct points, we could use Lagrange interpolation to find $p(5)$. This method allows us to compute the value of the polynomial at any point, given its values at a set of distinct points.\n\n## Step 21: Apply Lagrange interpolation\nThe Lagrange interpolating polynomial is given by:\n\\[p(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} y_i \\prod_{j=1, j \\neq i}^{4} \\frac{x - x_j}{x_i - x_j}\\]\nwhere $y_i = \\frac{1}{i^2}$ and $x_i = i$ for $i = 1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\n## Step 22: Calculate $p(5)$ using Lagrange interpolation\nSubstituting $x = 5$ and the given values into the formula gives:\n\\[p(5) = \\frac{1}{1^2} \\cdot \\frac{(5-2)(5-3)(5-4)}{(1-2)(1-3)(1-4)} + \\frac{1}{2^2} \\cdot \\frac{(5-1)(5-3)(5-4)}{(2-1)(2-3)(2-4)} + \\frac{1}{3^2} \\cdot \\frac{(5-1)(5-2)(5-4)}{(3-1)(3-2)(3-4)} + \\frac{1}{4^2} \\cdot \\frac{(5-1)(5-2)(5-3)}{(4-1)(4-2)(4-3)}\\]\n\n## Step 23: Simplify the expression for $p(5)$\n\\[p(5) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{(3)(2)(1)}{(-1)(-2)(-3)} + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{(4)(2)(1)}{(1)(-1)(-2)} + \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot \\frac{(4)(3)(1)}{(2)(1)(-1)} + \\frac{1}{16} \\cdot \\frac{(4)(3)(2)}{(3)(2)(1)}\\]\n\n## Step 24: Perform the arithmetic\n\\[p(5) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{6}{-6} + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{8}{2} + \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot \\"
