    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given sequence\nWe are given a sequence of real numbers $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots$ that satisfies the equation $a_n = a_{n - 1} a_{n + 1}$ for all $n \\ge 2$. We need to find $a_{2009}$ given $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$ and $a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$.\n\n## Step 2: Derive a recursive formula for $a_{n+1}$\nFrom the given equation $a_n = a_{n - 1} a_{n + 1}$, we can express $a_{n+1}$ in terms of $a_n$ and $a_{n-1}$ as $a_{n+1} = \\frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}}$.\n\n## Step 3: Observe the periodic pattern in the sequence\nUsing the recursive formula, we can calculate a few terms to observe any pattern. Starting with $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$ and $a_2 = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{7}}{a_0}$ (assuming $a_0$ is some initial value), $a_3 = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$, and so on. Given the nature of the recursion, it seems the sequence might exhibit periodic behavior after some initial terms.\n\n## Step 4: Establish the periodicity of the sequence\nLet's calculate the first few terms explicitly to identify any repeating pattern. Given $a_n = a_{n-1}a_{n+1}$, rearranging gives $a_{n+1} = \\frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}}$. This implies that the sequence will repeat every 6 terms because $a_{n+6} = a_n$ due to the nature of the recursion, which can be verified by substituting $n+1, n+2, \\dots, n+6$ into the formula and observing the cyclic dependency.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the position of $a_{2009}$ in the sequence's cycle\nSince the sequence repeats every 6 terms, we need to find the remainder when 2009 is divided by 6. $2009 \\mod 6 = 5$, meaning $a_{2009}$ is equivalent to $a_5$ in the sequence's cycle.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $a_5$ using the given information\nTo find $a_5$, we can use the periodicity of the sequence and the given values. Since $a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$ and knowing the sequence repeats every 6 terms, we look for a term that is 5 positions after a known term in the cycle, considering $a_{1776}$ as $a_6$ in the cycle (since $1776 \\mod 6 = 0$). Given $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$ and the relationship between terms, we can derive $a_5$ by utilizing the periodic nature and the given values.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the periodicity to find $a_{2009}$\nSince $a_{1776} = a_6$ in the cycle and $a_6 = a_0$ in the pattern, and knowing $a_{2009}$ corresponds to $a_5$ in the cycle, we use the given $a_1$ and $a_{1776}$ to establish the cycle's values. Given $a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$, which would correspond to $a_6$ in a cycle starting from $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$, and knowing the sequence's periodic nature, $a_{2009}$ would have the same value as $a_5$ in this cycle.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate $a_5$ directly\nFrom $a_n = a_{n-1}a_{n+1}$, letting $n=2$ gives $a_2 = a_1a_3$. For $n=3$, $a_3 = a_2a_4$. Continuing this pattern and using the fact that $a_6 = a_0$ (in terms of cycle position), and given values, we aim to find $a_5$. Since $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$ and $a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$, which is $a_6$ in the cycle, implying $a_6 = a_0 = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$, we can deduce $a_5$ using the inverse relationship of the sequence's definition.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for $a_5$ using $a_1$ and $a_6$\nGiven $a_6 = \\frac{a_5}{a_4}$ and $a_5 = \\frac{a_4}{a_3}$, $a_4 = \\frac{a_3}{a_2}$, $a_3 = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$, and $a_2 = \\frac{a_1}{a_0}$, but knowing $a_6 = a_0$ and $a_1$, we can solve for $a_5$. If $a_0 = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$ and $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$, then using the periodic nature and the formula, $a_5 = \\frac{a_6}{a_1} = \\frac{13 + \\sqrt{7}}{1 + \\sqrt{7}}$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the expression for $a_5$\nTo simplify $\\frac{13 + \\sqrt{7}}{1 + \\sqrt{7}}$, we rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator: $\\frac{13 + \\sqrt{7}}{1 + \\sqrt{7}} \\cdot \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{7}}{1 - \\sqrt{7}}$.\n\n## Step 11: Perform the multiplication\n$\\frac{(13 + \\sqrt{7})(1 - \\sqrt{7})}{(1 + \\sqrt{7})(1 - \\sqrt{7})} = \\frac{13 - 13\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{7} - 7}{1 - 7} = \\frac{6 - 12\\sqrt{7}}{-6}$.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the fraction\n$\\frac{6 - 12\\sqrt{7}}{-6} = -1 + 2\\sqrt{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-1 + 2\\sqrt{7}}$"
