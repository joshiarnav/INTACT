    "problem": "For how many real values of $c$ do we have $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$?",
    "solution": "We have $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\sqrt{{\\frac12}^2 + (-c)^2} = \\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14}$, so $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ gives us $\\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14} = \\frac34$.  Squaring both sides gives $c^2 + \\frac14 = \\frac9{16}$, so $c^2=\\frac5{16}$.  Taking the square root of both sides gives $c = \\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ and $c=-\\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ as solutions, so there are $\\boxed{2}$ real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nWe also could have solved this equation by noting that $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ means that the complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is $\\frac34$ units from the origin in the complex plane.  Therefore, it is on the circle centered at the origin with radius $\\frac34$.  The complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is also on the vertical line that intersects the real axis at $\\frac12$, which is inside the aforementioned circle.  Since this line goes inside the circle, it must intersect the circle at $\\boxed{2}$ points, which correspond to the values of $c$ that satisfy the original equation.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nThe problem asks us to find the number of real values of $c$ for which the given equation $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ holds true.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the definition of the absolute value of a complex number\nThe absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, is given by $|z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the definition to the given complex number\nFor the complex number $\\frac12 - ci$, we have $a = \\frac12$ and $b = -c$. So, the absolute value is $\\left|\\frac12 - ci\\right| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + (-c)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac14 + c^2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Set up the equation based on the given condition\nWe are given that $\\left|\\frac12 - ci\\right| = \\frac34$. Substituting the expression for the absolute value, we get $\\sqrt{\\frac14 + c^2} = \\frac34$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the equation for $c$\nSquaring both sides of the equation gives $\\frac14 + c^2 = \\left(\\frac34\\right)^2 = \\frac9{16}$. Subtracting $\\frac14$ from both sides yields $c^2 = \\frac9{16} - \\frac14 = \\frac9{16} - \\frac4{16} = \\frac5{16}$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the real values of $c$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives $c = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac5{16}}$. Therefore, $c = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt5}{4}$.\n\n## Step 7: Count the number of real values of $c$\nThere are two real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
