    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recognize that z^2 + z + 1 = 0 is a quadratic equation\nThe equation $z^2 + z + 1 = 0$ is a quadratic equation in the form $az^2 + bz + c = 0$, where $a = 1$, $b = 1$, and $c = 1$. This equation can be solved using the quadratic formula.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the quadratic equation for z\nTo solve $z^2 + z + 1 = 0$, we can use the quadratic formula, $z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Substituting $a = 1$, $b = 1$, and $c = 1$ into the formula gives $z = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4}}{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{-3}$ involves the imaginary unit $i$, where $i = \\sqrt{-1}$, the solutions are $z = \\frac{-1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the roots of the equation in terms of complex numbers\nThe roots of the equation $z^2 + z + 1 = 0$ are complex numbers, specifically $z = \\frac{-1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $z = \\frac{-1 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. These roots can also be represented in polar form, which may be useful for calculating powers of $z$.\n\n## Step 4: Notice the relationship between z and its powers\nSince $z^2 + z + 1 = 0$, we can rearrange this equation to find $z^2 = -z - 1$. This relationship can be used to express higher powers of $z$ in terms of lower powers.\n\n## Step 5: Express higher powers of z in terms of lower powers\nUsing $z^2 = -z - 1$, we can find expressions for $z^3$, $z^4$, and so on, to look for a pattern. For example, $z^3 = z \\cdot z^2 = z \\cdot (-z - 1) = -z^2 - z = -(-z - 1) - z = 1$. This means $z^3 = 1$, which is a critical observation for simplifying $z^{97} + z^{98} + z^{99} + z^{100} + z^{101}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the given expression using the pattern observed\nSince $z^3 = 1$, we can reduce each power of $z$ in the given expression modulo 3. Thus, $z^{97} = z^{1}$, $z^{98} = z^{2}$, $z^{99} = z^{0} = 1$, $z^{100} = z^{1}$, and $z^{101} = z^{2}$. Substituting these into the expression gives $z + z^2 + 1 + z + z^2$.\n\n## Step 7: Further simplify the expression\nCombining like terms, we have $2z + 2z^2 + 1$. Since $z^2 = -z - 1$, we substitute to get $2z + 2(-z - 1) + 1 = 2z - 2z - 2 + 1 = -1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-1}$"
