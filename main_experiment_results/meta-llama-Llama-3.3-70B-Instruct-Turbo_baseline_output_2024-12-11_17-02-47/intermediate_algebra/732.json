    "problem": "You have a rectangular prism box with length $x+5$ units, width $x-5$ units, and height $x^{2}+25$ units. For how many positive integer values of $x$ is the volume of the box less than 700 units?",
    "solution": "To find the volume of the box, we multiply the three dimensions: $(x+5)(x-5)(x^{2}+25) = (x^{2}-25)(x^{2}+25) = x^{4}-625$. We want to find $x$ such that $x^{4}-625<700$, which simplifies to $x^{4}<1325$. Taking the fourth root shows us that $x$ is less than $\\sqrt[4]{1325}$, which is between 6 and 7 (since $6^4=1296$ while $7^4=2401$). So $x$ could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, we see that the width is $x-5$ units, and this must be a positive number, so the only value of $x$ which works is 6. Thus, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ possible value of $x$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism.\nThe volume \\(V\\) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula \\(V = lwh\\), where \\(l\\) is the length, \\(w\\) is the width, and \\(h\\) is the height.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the given dimensions into the volume formula.\nGiven that the length \\(l = x + 5\\), the width \\(w = x - 5\\), and the height \\(h = x^2 + 25\\), the volume formula becomes \\(V = (x + 5)(x - 5)(x^2 + 25)\\).\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the volume formula.\nSimplifying the expression, we notice that \\((x + 5)(x - 5) = x^2 - 25\\). Thus, \\(V = (x^2 - 25)(x^2 + 25)\\).\n\n## Step 4: Further simplify the volume formula.\nRecognizing that \\((x^2 - 25)(x^2 + 25) = x^4 - 625\\), the volume formula simplifies to \\(V = x^4 - 625\\).\n\n## Step 5: Set up the inequality for the volume condition.\nWe are told that the volume of the box must be less than 700 units. So, we set up the inequality \\(x^4 - 625 < 700\\).\n\n## Step 6: Solve the inequality for \\(x^4\\).\nAdding 625 to both sides of the inequality gives \\(x^4 < 1325\\).\n\n## Step 7: Find the fourth root of both sides of the inequality.\nTaking the fourth root of both sides gives \\(x < \\sqrt[4]{1325}\\).\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the fourth root of 1325.\n\\(\\sqrt[4]{1325} \\approx 6.88\\).\n\n## Step 9: Consider the constraints on \\(x\\) due to the dimensions of the box.\nGiven that the width is \\(x - 5\\), \\(x\\) must be greater than 5 to have a positive width.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the range of positive integer values of \\(x\\) that satisfy both the volume condition and the dimension constraints.\nSince \\(x\\) must be a positive integer, \\(x > 5\\), and \\(x < 6.88\\), the only possible integer value for \\(x\\) that satisfies these conditions is \\(x = 6\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
