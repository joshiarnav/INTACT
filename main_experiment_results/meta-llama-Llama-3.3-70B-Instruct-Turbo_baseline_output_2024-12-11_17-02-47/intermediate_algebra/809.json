    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the equation of the parabola\nThe equation of the parabola is given by $y = -x^2 + 6x - 5$.\n\n## Step 2: Find the coordinates of point C\nSince point $C = (p,q)$ lies on the parabola, we can substitute $p$ into the equation of the parabola to find $q$. Thus, $q = -p^2 + 6p - 5$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the equation of the line AB\nTo find the equation of the line passing through points $A = (1,0)$ and $B = (4,3)$, we first need to find the slope of the line. The slope is given by $\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{3 - 0}{4 - 1} = 1$. The equation of the line in slope-intercept form is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. Using point $A$, we can find $b$: $0 = 1(1) + b \\Rightarrow b = -1$. Thus, the equation of the line is $y = x - 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the height of triangle ABC\nThe height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from point $C$ to line $AB$. The height $h$ can be found using the formula $h = \\frac{|Ax + By + C|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}$, where the line is in the form $Ax + By + C = 0$. Rearranging the equation of the line to this form, we get $x - y - 1 = 0$. Thus, $A = 1$, $B = -1$, and $C = -1$. The height $h$ is then $h = \\frac{|1(p) - 1(q) - 1|}{\\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = \\frac{|p - q - 1|}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute q into the height equation\nSince $q = -p^2 + 6p - 5$, we substitute this into the equation for $h$: $h = \\frac{|p - (-p^2 + 6p - 5) - 1|}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{|p^2 - 5p + 4|}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the base of triangle ABC\nThe base of the triangle is the distance between points $A$ and $B$, which is $|1 - 4| = 3$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the area of triangle ABC\nThe area of a triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. Thus, the area $A$ is $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times \\frac{|p^2 - 5p + 4|}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3|p^2 - 5p + 4|}{2\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n## Step 8: Maximize the area of triangle ABC\nTo maximize the area, we need to maximize $|p^2 - 5p + 4|$. Since this is a quadratic equation, its maximum value occurs at its vertex. The vertex of a parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ occurs at $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. Thus, $p = -\\frac{-5}{2(1)} = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the maximum area\nSubstitute $p = \\frac{5}{2}$ into the equation for the area: $A = \\frac{3|(\\frac{5}{2})^2 - 5(\\frac{5}{2}) + 4|}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3|(\\frac{25}{4}) - \\frac{25}{2} + 4|}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3|(\\frac{25}{4}) - \\frac{50}{4} + \\frac{16}{4}|}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3|-\\frac{9}{4}|}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{9}{4}}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{27}{8\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{27\\sqrt{2}}{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{27\\sqrt{2}}{16}}$"
