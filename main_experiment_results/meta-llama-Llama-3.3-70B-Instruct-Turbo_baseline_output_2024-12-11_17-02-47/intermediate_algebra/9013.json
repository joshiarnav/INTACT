This can be done by squaring 25 and 72 and then adding the two results together.\n\n## Step 2: Square 25 and 72\n$25^2 = 625$ and $72^2 = 5184$.\n\n## Step 3: Add the squared values together\n$625 + 5184 = 5809$.\n\n## Step 4: Factorize 5809 to find its prime divisors\nNow, we need to factorize 5809 to find its prime divisors. This involves finding the prime numbers that multiply together to give 5809.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the prime factorization of 5809\nAfter examining 5809, we find that $5809 = 37 \\times 157$, where both 37 and 157 are prime numbers.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the largest prime divisor\nFrom the prime factorization, we can see that the largest prime divisor of $25^2+72^2$ is 157.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{157}$"
