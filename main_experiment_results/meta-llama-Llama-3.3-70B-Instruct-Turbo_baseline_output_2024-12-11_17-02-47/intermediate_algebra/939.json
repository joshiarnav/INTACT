    "solution": "Let $r$ and $s$ be the two common roots.  Then $r$ and $s$ are the roots of\n\\[(x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) - (x^3 + bx^2 + 14 + 8) = (a - b) x^2 - 3x - 2.\\]Note that $r$ and $s$ are also the roots of\n\\begin{align*}\n&4(x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) - 3(x^3 + bx^2 + 14x + 8) \\\\\n&= x^3 + (4a - 3b) x^2 + 2x \\\\\n&= x[x^2 + (4a - 3b) x + 2].\n\\end{align*}Since the constant coefficient of $x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6$ is nonzero, both $r$ and $s$ are non-zero.  Therefore, $r$ and $s$ are the roots of\n\\[x^2 + (4a - 3b) x + 2.\\]Hence, both $r$ and $s$ are the roots of $-x^2 + (3b - 4a) x - 2.$  But $r$ and $s$ are also the roots of $(a - b) x^2 - 3x - 2,$ so the coefficients must match.  This gives us $a - b = -1$ and $3b - 4a = -3.$  Solving, we find $(a,b) = \\boxed{(6,7)}.$\n\nFor these values, the given cubics become\n\\begin{align*}\nx^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6 &= (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3), \\\\\nx^3 + 7x^2 + 14x + 8 &= (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 4).\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Let's assume the common roots are $r$ and $s$.\nWe are given two cubic polynomials and we need to find the coefficients $a$ and $b$ such that these polynomials have two distinct roots in common. Let's denote these common roots as $r$ and $s$.\n\n## Step 2: Express the polynomials as a product of linear factors.\nThe first polynomial can be expressed as $(x - r)(x - s)(x - t)$, where $t$ is the third root of the first polynomial. Similarly, the second polynomial can be expressed as $(x - r)(x - s)(x - u)$, where $u$ is the third root of the second polynomial.\n\n## Step 3: Expand the factored form of the first polynomial.\nBy expanding the factored form of the first polynomial, we get $x^3 - (r + s + t)x^2 + (rs + rt + st)x - rst = x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6$.\n\n## Step 4: Expand the factored form of the second polynomial.\nBy expanding the factored form of the second polynomial, we get $x^3 - (r + s + u)x^2 + (rs + ru + su)x - rsu = x^3 + bx^2 + 14x + 8$.\n\n## Step 5: Equate the coefficients of the $x^2$ terms.\nEquating the coefficients of the $x^2$ terms in the expanded forms of the two polynomials, we get $-(r + s + t) = a$ and $-(r + s + u) = b$.\n\n## Step 6: Equate the constant terms.\nEquating the constant terms in the expanded forms of the two polynomials, we get $-rst = 6$ and $-rsu = 8$.\n\n## Step 7: Divide the two equations obtained from the constant terms.\nDividing the two equations obtained from the constant terms, we get $\\frac{-rst}{-rsu} = \\frac{6}{8}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{t}{u} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\n## Step 8: Equate the coefficients of the $x$ terms.\nEquating the coefficients of the $x$ terms in the expanded forms of the two polynomials, we get $rs + rt + st = 11$ and $rs + ru + su = 14$.\n\n## Step 9: Subtract the two equations obtained from the coefficients of the $x$ terms.\nSubtracting the two equations obtained from the coefficients of the $x$ terms, we get $(rs + rt + st) - (rs + ru + su) = 11 - 14$, which simplifies to $rt - ru + st - su = -3$.\n\n## Step 10: Factor out common terms.\nFactoring out common terms, we get $t(r - u) + s(t - u) = -3$, which further simplifies to $(r + s)(t - u) = -3$.\n\n## Step 11: Substitute $\\frac{t}{u} = \\frac{3}{4}$ into the equation.\nSubstituting $\\frac{t}{u} = \\frac{3}{4}$ into the equation, we get $(r + s)(\\frac{3}{4}u - u) = -3$, which simplifies to $-(r + s)\\frac{1}{4}u = -3$.\n\n## Step 12: Solve for $u$.\nSolving for $u$, we get $u = \\frac{12}{r + s}$.\n\n## Step 13: Substitute $u = \\frac{12}{r + s}$ into $-rsu = 8$.\nSubstituting $u = \\frac{12}{r + s}$ into $-rsu = 8$, we get $-rs\\frac{12}{r + s} = 8$, which simplifies to $-\\frac{12rs}{r + s} = 8$.\n\n## Step 14: Solve for $rs$.\nSolving for $rs$, we get $rs = -\\frac{2}{3}(r + s)$.\n\n## Step 15: Substitute $rs = -\\frac{2}{3}(r + s)$ into $rs + rt + st = 11$.\nSubstituting $rs = -\\frac{2}{3}(r + s)$ into $rs + rt + st = 11$, we get $-\\frac{2}{3}(r + s) + rt + st = 11$.\n\n## Step 16: Substitute $t = \\frac{3}{4}u = \\frac{3}{4}\\frac{12}{r + s} = \\frac{9}{r + s}$.\nSubstituting $t = \\frac{3}{4}u = \\frac{3}{4}\\frac{12}{r + s} = \\frac{9}{r + s}$, we get $-\\frac{2}{3}(r + s) + r\\frac{9}{r + s} + s\\frac{9}{r + s} = 11$.\n\n## Step 17: Simplify the equation.\nSimplifying the equation, we get $-\\frac{2}{3}(r + s) + \\frac{9r + 9s}{r + s} = 11$, which further simplifies to $-\\frac{2}{3}(r + s) + \\frac{9(r + s)}{r + s} = 11$.\n\n## Step 18: Combine like terms.\nCombining like terms, we get $-\\frac{2}{3}(r + s) + 9 = 11$, which simplifies to $-\\frac{2}{3}(r + s) = 2$.\n\n## Step 19: Solve for $r + s$.\nSolving for $r + s$, we get $r + s = -3$.\n\n## Step 20: Substitute $r + s = -3$ into $rs = -\\frac{2}{3}(r + s)$.\nSubstituting $r + s = -3$ into $rs = -\\frac{2}{3}(r + s)$, we get $rs = -\\frac{2}{3}(-3)$, which simplifies to $rs = 2$.\n\n## Step 21: Solve the system of equations $r + s = -3$ and $rs = 2$.\nSolving the system of equations $r + s = -3$ and $rs = 2$, we find that $r$ and $s$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0$, which factors into $(x + 1)(x + 2) = 0$.\n\n## Step 22: Find the roots of the quadratic equation.\nThe roots of the quadratic equation are $r = -1$ and $s = -2$.\n\n## Step 23: Substitute $r = -1$ and $s = -2$ into $-rst = 6$.\nSubstituting $r = -1$ and $s = -2$ into $-rst = 6$, we get $-(-1)(-2)t = 6$, which simplifies to $-2t = 6$.\n\n## Step 24: Solve for $t$.\nSolving for $t$, we get $t = -3$.\n\n## Step 25: Substitute $r = -1$, $s = -2$, and $t = -3$ into $-(r + s + t) = a$.\nSubstituting $r = -1$, $s = -2$, and $t = -3$ into $-(r + s + t) = a$, we get $-(-1 - 2 - 3) = a$, which simplifies to $a = 6$.\n\n## Step 26: Substitute $r = -1$ and $s = -2$ into $u = \\frac{12}{r + s}$.\nSubstituting $r = -1$ and $s = -2$ into $u = \\frac{12}{r + s}$, we get $u = \\frac{12}{-1 - 2}$, which simplifies to $u = -4$.\n\n## Step 27: Substitute $r = -1$, $s = -2$, and $u = -4$ into $-(r + s + u) = b$.\nSubstituting $r = -1$, $s = -2$, and $u = -4$ into $-(r + s + u) = b$, we get $-(-1 - 2 - 4) = b$, which simplifies to $b = 7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(6,7)}$"
