    "problem": "If the seven-digit number $854n526$ is divisible by $11$, what is $n$?",
    "solution": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the divisibility rule for 11\nA number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in the odd positions and the sum of its digits in the even positions is either 0 or a multiple of 11.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the odd and even positions in the number $854n526$\nThe odd positions are the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th digits: 8, 4, n, 6.\nThe even positions are the 2nd, 4th, and 6th digits: 5, 5, 2.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the sum of the digits in the odd positions\nSum of odd positions = 8 + 4 + n + 6 = 18 + n.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of the digits in the even positions\nSum of even positions = 5 + 5 + 2 = 12.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the divisibility rule for 11\nFor the number to be divisible by 11, the difference between the sum of the odd positions and the sum of the even positions must be 0 or a multiple of 11.\nSo, (18 + n) - 12 = 6 + n must be 0 or a multiple of 11.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for n\n6 + n must equal 0 or a multiple of 11. Since n is a single digit, the only possible value that makes 6 + n a multiple of 11 is when 6 + n = 11, because 6 + n = 0 is impossible for a positive digit n.\nTherefore, n = 11 - 6 = 5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
