    "problem": "Convert $199_{10}$ to base 2. Let $x$ be the number of zeros and $y$ be the number of ones in base 2. What is the value of $y-x?$",
    "solution": "The largest power of 2 that divides $199$ is $2^7$, which equals 128. Since $(1\\cdot 2^7)=128<199<(2\\cdot 2^7)=256$, the digit in the $2^7$ place is $1$. We know that $199-128=71$, and that $71$ can be expressed as $64+4+2+1$, or $(1\\cdot 2^6)+(1\\cdot 2^2)+(1\\cdot 2^1)+(1\\cdot 2^0)$. This means that $199_{10}=11000111_2$. Therefore, $x=3$ and $y=5$; and $y-x=5-3=\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To convert $199_{10}$ to base 2, we first need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 199.\nThe largest power of 2 less than or equal to 199 is $2^7 = 128$.\n\n## Step 2: We then subtract this power of 2 from 199 and repeat the process with the remainder until we reach 0.\nSubtracting $2^7$ from 199 gives us $199 - 128 = 71$.\n\n## Step 3: Now, we find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 71.\nThe largest power of 2 less than or equal to 71 is $2^6 = 64$.\n\n## Step 4: We subtract $2^6$ from 71.\nSubtracting $2^6$ from 71 gives us $71 - 64 = 7$.\n\n## Step 5: Next, we find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 7.\nThe largest power of 2 less than or equal to 7 is $2^2 = 4$.\n\n## Step 6: We subtract $2^2$ from 7.\nSubtracting $2^2$ from 7 gives us $7 - 4 = 3$.\n\n## Step 7: Now, we find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 3.\nThe largest power of 2 less than or equal to 3 is $2^1 = 2$.\n\n## Step 8: We subtract $2^1$ from 3.\nSubtracting $2^1$ from 3 gives us $3 - 2 = 1$.\n\n## Step 9: Lastly, we find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 1.\nThe largest power of 2 less than or equal to 1 is $2^0 = 1$.\n\n## Step 10: We subtract $2^0$ from 1.\nSubtracting $2^0$ from 1 gives us $1 - 1 = 0$.\n\n## Step 11: Now that we have the powers of 2 that make up 199, we can express 199 in base 2.\nFrom the powers of 2 used (7, 6, 2, 1, 0), we can express $199_{10}$ as $11000111_2$.\n\n## Step 12: We then count the number of zeros and ones in the base 2 representation of 199.\nIn $11000111_2$, there are 3 zeros and 5 ones.\n\n## Step 13: Calculate the value of $y-x$.\n$y = 5$ (number of ones) and $x = 3$ (number of zeros), so $y-x = 5 - 3 = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
