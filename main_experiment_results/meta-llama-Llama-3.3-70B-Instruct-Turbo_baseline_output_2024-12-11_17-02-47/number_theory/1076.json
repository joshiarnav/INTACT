    "problem": "What is the digit in the tens place when $7^{2005}$ is expressed in decimal notation?",
    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of the last two digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $07, 49, 43, 01, 07, 49, 43, 01,\\ldots$ . The cycle of the last two digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 numbers long: 07, 49, 43, 01. Thus, to find the tens digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=0$ or 1 corresponds to the tens digit 0, and $R=2$ or 3 corresponds to the units digit 4). Since $2005\\div4=501R1$, the tens digit of $7^{2005}$ is $ \\boxed{0}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: We need to find the pattern of the last two digits of powers of 7 to determine the tens digit of $7^{2005}$.\nTo find the pattern, we start calculating the last two digits of increasing powers of 7: $7^1=07$, $7^2=49$, $7^3=43$, $7^4=01$, $7^5=07$, $7^6=49$, $7^7=43$, $7^8=01$, and so on. We notice that the sequence repeats every 4 powers.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the position of $7^{2005}$ in the pattern.\nGiven that the pattern repeats every 4 powers, we divide 2005 by 4 to find the remainder, which tells us the position in the pattern. $2005 \\div 4 = 501$ remainder $1$. This means $7^{2005}$ will have the same last two digits as $7^1$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the tens digit based on the pattern.\nSince $7^{2005}$ corresponds to $7^1$ in the pattern, and $7^1 = 07$, the tens digit is $0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"
