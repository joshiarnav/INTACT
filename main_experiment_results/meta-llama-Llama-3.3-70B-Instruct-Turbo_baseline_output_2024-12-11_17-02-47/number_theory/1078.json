    "problem": "When an integer is divided by 15, the remainder is 7. Find the sum of the remainders when the same integer is divided by 3 and by 5.",
    "solution": "We let our integer be $n$.  the first sentence tells us that  \\[n\\equiv 7\\pmod {15}.\\] Since 3 and 5 are both factors of 15 we deduce \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv2\\pmod5.\n\\end{align*} Therefore the remainders in question are 1 and 2, and their sum is $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nWe are given an integer that, when divided by 15, leaves a remainder of 7. We need to find the sum of the remainders when this integer is divided by 3 and by 5.\n\n## Step 2: Express the integer based on the given condition\nLet's denote the integer as $n$. According to the problem, $n$ can be expressed as $n = 15q + 7$, where $q$ is the quotient obtained when $n$ is divided by 15.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the remainder when $n$ is divided by 3\nTo find the remainder when $n$ is divided by 3, we consider $n = 15q + 7$. Since $15q$ is divisible by 3 (because 15 is divisible by 3), the remainder when $n$ is divided by 3 is the same as the remainder when 7 is divided by 3. When 7 is divided by 3, the remainder is 1.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the remainder when $n$ is divided by 5\nSimilarly, to find the remainder when $n$ is divided by 5, we look at $n = 15q + 7$. Since $15q$ is divisible by 5 (because 15 is divisible by 5), the remainder when $n$ is divided by 5 is the same as the remainder when 7 is divided by 5. When 7 is divided by 5, the remainder is 2.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the sum of the remainders\nThe remainder when $n$ is divided by 3 is 1, and the remainder when $n$ is divided by 5 is 2. Thus, the sum of these remainders is $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
