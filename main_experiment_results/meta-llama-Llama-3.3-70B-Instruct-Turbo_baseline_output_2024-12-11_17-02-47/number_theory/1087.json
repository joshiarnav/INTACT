    "problem": "What is the $100$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{3}{26}$ is expressed as a decimal?",
    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block. We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$. Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Convert the fraction to a decimal\nTo find the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{26}$, we perform long division. Dividing 3 by 26, we get a repeating decimal.\n\n## Step 2: Perform long division to find the repeating pattern\nPerforming long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26} = 0.115384615384...$ where the pattern $115384$ repeats.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the length of the repeating pattern\nThe length of the repeating pattern is 6 digits, which is $115384$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the position of the 100th digit\nSince the pattern repeats every 6 digits, we divide 100 by 6 to find how many complete cycles there are before reaching the 100th digit. $100 \\div 6 = 16$ remainder $4$. This means the 100th digit is the 4th digit in the repeating pattern.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the 4th digit in the repeating pattern\nThe repeating pattern is $115384$. The 4th digit in this pattern is $3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
