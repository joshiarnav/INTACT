    "solution": "In the rightmost column there is no carrying, so our base must be greater than 5. However, in the next column we see that $6_{b}+3_{b}=11_{b}$. This tells us that $b$ divides into 9 once, with a remainder 1. Therefore, $b=\\boxed{8}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given equation\nWe are given an equation in base $b$: $161_{b}+134_{b}=315_{b}$. This means that when we add the numbers $161$ and $134$ in base $b$, the result should be $315$ in base $b$.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the numbers to decimal form for easier calculation\nTo solve for $b$, let's first convert these numbers to their decimal equivalents. The number $161_{b}$ in decimal form is $1 \\cdot b^2 + 6 \\cdot b^1 + 1 \\cdot b^0 = b^2 + 6b + 1$. The number $134_{b}$ in decimal form is $1 \\cdot b^2 + 3 \\cdot b^1 + 4 \\cdot b^0 = b^2 + 3b + 4$. The number $315_{b}$ in decimal form is $3 \\cdot b^2 + 1 \\cdot b^1 + 5 \\cdot b^0 = 3b^2 + b + 5$.\n\n## Step 3: Write the equation with the decimal equivalents\nSubstituting these decimal equivalents back into the original equation gives us $(b^2 + 6b + 1) + (b^2 + 3b + 4) = 3b^2 + b + 5$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation by combining like terms yields $2b^2 + 9b + 5 = 3b^2 + b + 5$.\n\n## Step 5: Rearrange the equation to solve for $b$\nRearranging the equation to set it equal to zero gives $2b^2 + 9b + 5 - 3b^2 - b - 5 = 0$, which simplifies to $-b^2 + 8b = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Factor the equation\nFactoring out $b$ from the equation yields $b(-b + 8) = 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $b$\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us two possible solutions: $b = 0$ or $-b + 8 = 0$, which means $b = 8$. Since $b$ represents the base of a number system, it cannot be zero. Therefore, the only valid solution is $b = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
