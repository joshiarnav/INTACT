    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the smallest and largest two-digit multiples of 7.\nThe smallest two-digit multiple of 7 is 14, and the largest two-digit multiple of 7 is 98.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the total number of two-digit multiples of 7.\nTo find the number of terms, we use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the number of terms, and $d$ is the common difference. For the sequence of two-digit multiples of 7, $a_1 = 14$, $a_n = 98$, and $d = 7$. Substituting these values into the formula gives $98 = 14 + (n-1)7$. Solving for $n$, we get $84 = (n-1)7$, which simplifies to $n-1 = 12$, and thus $n = 13$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the sum of all the two-digit multiples of 7.\nThe sum $S_n$ of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$. Substituting $n = 13$, $a_1 = 14$, and $a_n = 98$ into the formula gives $S_{13} = \\frac{13}{2}(14 + 98)$.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the arithmetic to find the sum.\n$S_{13} = \\frac{13}{2}(14 + 98) = \\frac{13}{2}(112) = 13 \\times 56 = 728$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the arithmetic mean.\nThe arithmetic mean is the sum of the terms divided by the number of terms. Thus, the mean is $\\frac{728}{13}$.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the division to find the mean.\n$\\frac{728}{13} = 56$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{56}$"
