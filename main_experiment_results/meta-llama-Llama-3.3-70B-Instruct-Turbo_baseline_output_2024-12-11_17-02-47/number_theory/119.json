    "problem": "In a physical education class, students line up in four rows to do exercises. One particular class has over 30 students, with three rows having the same number of students and one row having one more student than the other three rows. What is the smallest possible class size for this physical education class?",
    "solution": "If the first three rows have 1 student, the last row must have two students, so there are 5 students in total. This is not greater than 30, so we must add another student to each row. This gives 9, which is still not greater than 30. We have to keep adding 4 until we get to a number greater than 30. As a result, we reach 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33. 33 is the first integer greater than 30, so this class has $\\boxed{33}$ students.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem describes a physical education class where students line up in four rows. Three of the rows have the same number of students, and one row has one more student than the other three. We need to find the smallest possible class size that satisfies these conditions and has more than 30 students.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the number of students in each row\nLet's denote the number of students in each of the three equal rows as x. The row with one more student than the others will then have x + 1 students.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of students\nThe total number of students in the class can be represented as the sum of the students in all four rows: x + x + x + (x + 1) = 4x + 1.\n\n## Step 4: Find the smallest class size with more than 30 students\nWe need to find the smallest value of x such that 4x + 1 > 30. This means 4x > 29.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for x\nTo find the smallest integer value of x that satisfies 4x > 29, we can start by dividing both sides of the inequality by 4, which gives x > 7.25. Since x must be an integer (as it represents the number of students), the smallest possible value for x is 8.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the smallest class size\nSubstitute x = 8 into the total number of students formula: 4x + 1 = 4*8 + 1 = 32 + 1 = 33.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{33}$"
