    "problem": "A number is divisible by $9$ if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9.$ For example, the number $19\\,836$ is divisible by $9$ but $19\\,825$ is not.\n\nIf $D\\,767\\,E89$ is divisible by $9,$ where $D$ and $E$ each represent a single digit, what is the sum of all possible values of the sum $D+E?$",
    "solution": "For $D\\,767\\,E89$ to be divisible by $9,$ we must have $$D+7+6+7+E+8+9 = 37+D+E$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $D$ and $E$ are each a single digit, we know each is between $0$ and $9.$ Therefore, $D+E$ is between $0$ and $18.$ Therefore, $37+D+E$ is between $37$ and $55.$ The numbers between $37$ and $55$ that are divisible by $9$ are $45$ and $54.$\n\nIf $37+D+E=45,$ then $D+E=8.$\n\nIf $37+D+E=54,$ then $D+E=17.$\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $D+E$ are $8$ and $17.$ Our answer is then $8+17=\\boxed{25}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the divisibility rule for 9\nA number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. This means that for the number $D\\,767\\,E89$ to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits $D + 7 + 6 + 7 + E + 8 + 9$ must be divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 2: Express the sum of digits\nThe sum of the digits can be expressed as $D + E + 37$. For $D\\,767\\,E89$ to be divisible by 9, $D + E + 37$ must be divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the condition for divisibility by 9\nSince 37 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 9 (because $36$ is the closest multiple of 9 below 37), $D + E + 37$ will be divisible by 9 if $D + E + 1$ is divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 4: Find possible values of $D + E$\nFor $D + E + 1$ to be divisible by 9, $D + E + 1$ could be 9, 18, 27, etc. Since $D$ and $E$ are single digits, the maximum value for $D + E$ is 18 (when both $D$ and $E$ are 9). Therefore, possible values for $D + E + 1$ are 9 and 18, which means possible values for $D + E$ are 8 and 17.\n\n## Step 5: Sum all possible values of $D + E$\nTo find the sum of all possible values of $D + E$, we simply add the possible values: $8 + 17 = 25$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{25}$"
