    "problem": "A divisor of a number is a proper divisor if it is not equal to the number. What is the sum of the proper divisors of $432$?",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $432 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^3$. It follows that the sum of the divisors is equal to $(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4)(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3)$, as each factor of $432$ is represented when the product is expanded. We have to subtract $432$ so that we only count the proper divisors, so the answer is \\begin{align*}\n(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16)(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) - 432 &= (31)(40) - 432\\\\\n&= 1240 - 432\\\\\n&= \\boxed{808}.\\\\\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Find the prime factorization of 432\nTo find the sum of the proper divisors of 432, we first need to determine its prime factorization. The prime factorization of 432 is $2^4 \\cdot 3^3$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the sum of divisors\nThe sum of divisors of a number can be found using the formula $(1+p_1+p_1^2+...+p_1^{a_1})(1+p_2+p_2^2+...+p_2^{a_2})$, where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the prime factors of the number and $a_1$ and $a_2$ are their respective powers. Applying this formula to $432 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^3$, we get the sum of divisors as $(1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4)(1+3+3^2+3^3)$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the sum of powers of 2\nCalculating the sum of powers of 2: $1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 1+2+4+8+16 = 31$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of powers of 3\nCalculating the sum of powers of 3: $1+3+3^2+3^3 = 1+3+9+27 = 40$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total sum of divisors\nThe total sum of divisors is the product of the sums calculated in steps 3 and 4: $31 \\cdot 40 = 1240$.\n\n## Step 6: Subtract the number itself to get the sum of proper divisors\nSince we want the sum of the proper divisors, we subtract 432 from the total sum of divisors: $1240 - 432 = 808$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{808}$"
