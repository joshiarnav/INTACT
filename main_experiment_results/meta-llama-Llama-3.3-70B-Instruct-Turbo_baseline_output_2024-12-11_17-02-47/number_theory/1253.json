    "problem": "What is the largest number, with its digits all different, whose digits add up to 16?",
    "solution": "For a number to be as large as possible, we want as many places (digits) as possible. To allow for as many digits as possible, we want the digits to be small so that there will be more digits that add up to $16$. We start with the smallest number, $0$ and keep adding the next number. $0+1+2+3+4=10$. However, we cannot add $5$, because then we are left with $16-10-5=1$, and we already have the number $1$. Therefore, the next number to be added would be $16-10=6$.\nNow, we have the numbers $0,1,2,3,4,6$ to form a number. We want the larger places to have larger numbers. Therefore, we order the numbers in decreasing order to form the number $\\boxed{643210}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem\nThe problem asks for the largest number with all different digits, whose digits sum up to 16. This means we need to find a combination of unique digits (0-9) that add up to 16.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the maximum number of digits possible\nTo maximize the number, we want to use as many digits as possible. Starting from the smallest digit (0), we add digits until we reach or get close to 16. Since we're looking for the largest number, we'll start with the largest digits, but to maximize the number of digits, we should start from the smallest.\n\n## Step 3: Find the combination of digits that sums up to 16\nStarting with 0 and adding the next smallest digits: 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. We still need to add 6 more to reach 16. The next digit would be 5 (since 6 would exceed 16 when added to 10), but adding 5 would only get us to 15. We need one more digit to reach 16. Since we've used 0-4 and 5, the next available digit is 6, but using 6 directly exceeds our target. However, if we replace the 5 with a 6, we exceed the target. So, we actually look for a combination that fits exactly.\n\n## Step 4: Adjust the combination to fit the criteria\nConsidering the sum we have (10) and the need to add 6 to it, we look for a combination that allows us to reach 16 without repeating digits. One approach is to use larger digits first and then fill in with smaller ones. Starting over: 9 (the largest digit) + 7 (the next largest that keeps us under 16 when combined with 9) = 16. This combination is straightforward and uses only two digits, but to maximize the value of the number, we want to use as many digits as possible while keeping them unique.\n\n## Step 5: Re-evaluate for maximum digit usage\nGiven the constraint that digits must be unique and sum to 16, let's try to use more digits. A possible combination could involve starting with smaller numbers and adding more of them. However, the direct approach of using 9 and 7 is efficient for a two-digit solution. For more digits, consider: 9 + 8 = 17, which exceeds our limit. So, we look at combinations like 9 + 6 + 1 = 16, which fits our criteria perfectly and uses three digits.\n\n## Step 6: Arrange the digits to form the largest possible number\nWith the digits 9, 6, and 1, to form the largest possible number, we arrange them in descending order: 961.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{976}$"
