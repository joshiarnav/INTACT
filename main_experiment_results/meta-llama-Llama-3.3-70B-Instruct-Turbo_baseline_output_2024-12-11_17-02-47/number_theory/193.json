    "solution": "We start by testing palindromic sequences in base 4. Since the positive integer must be greater than 5, we start by analyzing $22_4$, which is $1010_2$. We then test $33_4$, which is $1111_2$. Converting to base 10, we have $33_4 = 3(4) + 3 = \\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and requirements\nWe need to find the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that forms a palindrome when expressed in both base 2 (binary) and base 4 (quaternary) number systems.\n\n## Step 2: Start with base 4 palindromes\nSince the number must be a palindrome in both base 2 and base 4, we start by examining potential palindromes in base 4, as this will limit our search space more than starting with base 2.\n\n## Step 3: Test the smallest base 4 palindromes greater than 5\nThe smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 is 6. We start testing from this point, looking for numbers that are palindromes in base 4. The first few palindromes in base 4 greater than 5 (in base 10) would include 11 (in base 4), which is 5 in base 10, so we need to look at the next option.\n\n## Step 4: Convert potential base 4 palindromes to base 10 and check if they are greater than 5\nThe next base 4 palindrome to consider after 11 (base 4) would be 22 (base 4), which converts to 2*4^1 + 2*4^0 = 8 + 2 = 10 in base 10. However, we need to verify if this number is also a palindrome in base 2.\n\n## Step 5: Convert the base 10 number to base 2 and check for palindrome\nConverting 10 (base 10) to base 2 gives us 1010, which is not a palindrome.\n\n## Step 6: Continue searching for a base 4 palindrome that is also a palindrome in base 2\nThe next potential palindrome in base 4 would be 33 (base 4), which converts to 3*4^1 + 3*4^0 = 12 + 3 = 15 in base 10.\n\n## Step 7: Convert 15 (base 10) to base 2 and check for palindrome\nConverting 15 (base 10) to base 2 gives us 1111, which is a palindrome.\n\n## Step 8: Verify that 15 meets all criteria\n15 is greater than 5, it is a palindrome in base 4 (33), and it is also a palindrome in base 2 (1111).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
