    "problem": "Find the number of odd digits in the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$.",
    "solution": "We begin by converting $233_{10}$ into base-4. Since $4^3=64$ is the largest power of 4 that is less than 233, and $3\\cdot64=192$ is the largest multiple of 64 that is less than 233, the coefficient of the $4^3$ term will be 3. From here, we are left with a remainder of $233-192=41$. The largest power of 4 that is less than this number is $4^2=16$, and the largest multiple of 16 that is less than 41 is $2\\cdot16=32$. This leaves us with $41-32=9$, which we can express as $2\\cdot4^1+1\\cdot4^0$. So, we find that $233_{10}=3\\cdot4^3+2\\cdot4^2+2\\cdot{4^1}+1\\cdot4^0=3221_4$, which has $\\boxed{2}$ odd digits.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Convert the given decimal number to base-4\nTo convert $233_{10}$ to base-4, we need to divide the number by 4 and keep track of the remainders. The remainders will represent the digits in the base-4 representation, with the last remainder being the rightmost digit.\n\n## Step 2: Perform the division steps\nDivide 233 by 4:\n- $233 \\div 4 = 58$ remainder 1\n- $58 \\div 4 = 14$ remainder 2\n- $14 \\div 4 = 3$ remainder 2\n- $3 \\div 4 = 0$ remainder 3\n\n## Step 3: Write down the base-4 representation\nStarting from the last remainder, the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$ is $3221_4$.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the odd digits in the base-4 representation\nIn base-4, the odd digits are 1 and 3. From the base-4 representation $3221_4$, we can identify the odd digits as 1 and 3.\n\n## Step 5: Count the number of odd digits\nThere are 2 odd digits in the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
