    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks for the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$. This means we need to find the smallest integer $x$ such that when $4x$ is divided by 27, the remainder is 13.\n\n## Step 2: Find the modular inverse of 4 modulo 27\nTo solve the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$, we need to find the modular inverse of 4 modulo 27. The modular inverse of $a$ modulo $m$ is an integer $b$ such that $ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$. In this case, we need to find $b$ such that $4b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the modular inverse\nTo find the modular inverse of 4 modulo 27, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or simply check integers of the form $27k+1$ where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer, to see if any of them are divisible by 4. However, a quicker method is to notice that $4 \\times 7 = 28$, which is $1$ more than $27$. Thus, $4 \\times 7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}$, meaning $7$ is the modular inverse of $4$ modulo $27$.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the modular inverse to solve the congruence\nNow that we know the modular inverse of 4 modulo 27 is 7, we can multiply both sides of the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$ by 7 to solve for $x$. This gives us $x \\equiv 7 \\times 13 \\pmod{27}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the solution\nWe calculate $7 \\times 13 = 91$. To find the smallest positive integer $x$ that satisfies the congruence, we need to find $91 \\pmod{27}$.\n\n## Step 6: Reduce 91 modulo 27\nDivide 91 by 27 to find the remainder. $91 \\div 27 = 3$ with a remainder of $10$. Thus, $91 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{27}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
