    "problem": "When $555_{10}$ is expressed in this base, it has 4 digits, in the form ABAB, where A and B are two different digits.  What base is it?",
    "solution": "First, let us find which bases result in $555_{10}$ having four digits. We must find base b such that $b^{4}>555_{10}\\geq b^{3}$. We easily determine that b can range from 5 to 8, inclusive.  We can now try each of these four bases to see which yields a number in the form ABAB.  For base six, we find that $6^{3}=216$, which can go into 555 only two times at most, leaving $555-2\\cdot216 = 123$ for the next three digits. $6^{2}=36$ goes into 123 three times at most, leaving us with $123-3\\cdot36 = 15$. Then, $6^{1}=6$ goes into 15 two times at most, leaving $15-2\\cdot6 = 3$ for the ones digit. So, the base $\\boxed{6}$ equivalent of $555_{10}$ is $2323_{6}$, which satisfies all of the requirements stated.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the range of bases for a 4-digit number\nTo express $555_{10}$ in another base with 4 digits, the base must be such that $b^{4} > 555_{10} \\geq b^{3}$, where $b$ is the base. This means we are looking for a base where $b^{3} \\leq 555 < b^{4}$.\n\n## Step 2: Find the smallest possible base\nWe start by finding the smallest base $b$ such that $b^{3} \\leq 555$. This requires testing different bases starting from $b=4$ upwards because $4^{3} = 64$ and $5^{3} = 125$, and we know $6^{3} = 216$ which is still less than 555, so we continue.\n\n## Step 3: Test base 6\nFor $b=6$, $6^{3} = 216$ which is less than 555, and $6^{4} = 1296$ which is greater than 555. So, base 6 is a potential base for expressing $555_{10}$ with 4 digits.\n\n## Step 4: Convert $555_{10}$ to base 6\nNow, convert $555_{10}$ to base 6 to see if it fits the ABAB pattern.\n- $555 \\div 6 = 92$ remainder 3\n- $92 \\div 6 = 15$ remainder 2\n- $15 \\div 6 = 2$ remainder 3\n- $2 \\div 6 = 0$ remainder 2\nSo, in base 6, $555_{10}$ is $2323_{6}$, which fits the ABAB pattern.\n\n## Step 5: Determine if base 6 is the correct base\nSince $555_{10}$ in base 6 is $2323_{6}$, and it follows the ABAB pattern with A=2 and B=3, base 6 satisfies the conditions given in the problem.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
