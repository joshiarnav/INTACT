    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the criteria for divisibility\nTo find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we must first establish the criteria for divisibility. A number is divisible by another if the remainder when the first number is divided by the second is zero. For a three-digit number $abc$ (where $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent the hundreds, tens, and ones place, respectively), it must be divisible by $a$, $b$, and $c$, and $a$, $b$, and $c$ must all be distinct and non-zero.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the constraints on the hundreds digit\nThe hundreds digit $a$ cannot be zero, and since we're looking for the largest possible number, we should start by considering $9$ as the hundreds digit, as it is the largest possible digit. This also helps in narrowing down our search, as the number must be divisible by $9$, which means the sum of its digits must also be divisible by $9$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply divisibility rules for common digits\nFor a number to be divisible by $9$, the sum of its digits must be divisible by $9$. Since we're starting with $9$ as the hundreds digit, the remaining digits $b$ and $c$ must sum to a number that, when added to $9$, results in a sum divisible by $9$. This gives us a few possible combinations to consider, but we must also ensure the entire number is divisible by $b$ and $c$, which further limits our options.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate potential candidates\nStarting with $9$ as the hundreds digit, potential sums for $b + c$ that would make $a + b + c$ divisible by $9$ include $0$, $9$, $18$, etc. However, $b$ and $c$ must also be non-zero and distinct, limiting our options. We then need to check each potential combination to see if the resulting three-digit number is indeed divisible by each of its digits.\n\n## Step 5: Assess divisibility by potential tens and ones digits\nGiven the constraint that the number must be divisible by its distinct, non-zero digits, and starting with $9$ as the hundreds digit, we look for pairs of $b$ and $c$ that meet these criteria and also make the entire number divisible by $9$. Since $b$ and $c$ must be distinct and non-zero, and considering the divisibility rules for various digits (e.g., $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$), we can systematically test potential combinations.\n\n## Step 6: Test specific combinations\nConsidering the divisibility by $9$ and the need for distinct, non-zero digits, one promising combination is $9$ for $a$, and then finding suitable $b$ and $c$ that are distinct, non-zero, and make the entire number divisible by each of them. A systematic approach involves checking each possible combination that fulfills these conditions, starting from the highest possible values for $b$ and $c$ to maximize the resulting three-digit number.\n\n## Step 7: Identify the largest valid number\nThrough the process of testing combinations that fulfill the divisibility criteria, we aim to identify the largest three-digit number that meets all conditions. Given the constraints and the need for the number to be divisible by its distinct, non-zero digits, the solution will be the largest number that satisfies these conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{936}$"
