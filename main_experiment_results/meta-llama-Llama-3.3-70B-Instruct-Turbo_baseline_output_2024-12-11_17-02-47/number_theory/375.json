    "problem": "How many even divisors does $7!$ have?",
    "solution": "By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, we may count the number of even divisors of $7!$ by counting the number of ways to form the prime factorization of an even divisor of $7!$.  Suppose that $7!$ is divisible by an even positive integer $r$.  Since the prime factorization of $7!$ is $7\\cdot(2\\cdot3)\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\cdot2)\\cdot3\\cdot2=2^4\\cdot3^2\\cdot5\\cdot7$, the prime factorization of $r$ does not include any primes other than $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$.  Express $r$ in terms of its prime factorization as $2^a3^b5^c7^d$.  Then $7!/r=2^{4-a}3^{2-b}5^{1-c}7^{1-d}$.  Since $7!/r$ is an integer, $d$ must equal $0$ or $1$, $c$ must equal $0$ or $1$, and $b$ must equal $0$, $1$ or $2$.  Finally, $a$ may be no larger than $4$, but it must be at least $1$ since $r$ is even.  Altogether there are $2\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=48$ total possibilities for the four exponents $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, and hence $\\boxed{48}$ even divisors.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate 7!\nTo find the number of even divisors of 7!, we first need to calculate 7!. 7! = 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5040.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the prime factorization of 7!\nNext, we need to determine the prime factorization of 7!. The prime factorization of 7! is 2^4 x 3^2 x 5 x 7.\n\n## Step 3: Understand what makes a divisor even\nA divisor of 7! will be even if it contains at least one factor of 2.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of even divisors\nTo calculate the number of even divisors, we need to consider the possible combinations of prime factors that include at least one 2. Since the prime factorization of 7! has 2^4, the possible powers of 2 in an even divisor are 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, and 2^4. For each of these, we can combine with any combination of the other prime factors (3^0 to 3^2, 5^0 to 5^1, 7^0 to 7^1). The number of even divisors can be calculated as follows: (4) * (3) * (2) * (2) = 48.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{48}$"
