    "problem": "What is the sum of the tens digit and the units digit in the decimal representation of $9^{2004}$?",
    "solution": "Write $9$ as $10-1$ and consider raising 9 to the 2004 power by multiplying out the expression \\[\n\\overbrace{(10-1)(10-1)(10-1)\\cdots(10-1)}^{2004\\text{ factors}}\n\\] There will be $2^{2004}$ terms in this expansion (one for each way to choose either 10 or $-1$ for each of the 2004 factors of $(10-1)$), but most of them will not affect the tens or units digit because they will have two or more factors of 10 and therefore will be divisible by 100.  Only the 2004 terms of $-10$ which come from choosing $-1$ in 2003 of the factors and 10 in the remaining one as well as the term $(-1)^{2004}=1$ remain.  Let $N$ represent the sum of all of the terms with more than 1 factor of 10.  We have \\begin{align*}\n(10-1)^{2004}&=N+2004(-10)+1\\\\\n&= N-20,\\!040+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-40+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-39.\n\\end{align*} So $9^{2004}$ is 39 less than a multiple of 100 and therefore ends in 61.  The sum of 6 and 1 is $\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the pattern of the last two digits of powers of 9\nTo find the sum of the tens digit and the units digit in the decimal representation of $9^{2004}$, we first need to determine the pattern of the last two digits of powers of 9.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the first few powers of 9 modulo 100 to identify a pattern\nWe start calculating the powers of 9 modulo 100 to observe any recurring pattern in the last two digits:\n- $9^1 \\equiv 9 \\mod 100$\n- $9^2 \\equiv 81 \\mod 100$\n- $9^3 \\equiv 29 \\mod 100$\n- $9^4 \\equiv 61 \\mod 100$\n- $9^5 \\equiv 49 \\mod 100$\n- $9^6 \\equiv 41 \\mod 100$\n- $9^7 \\equiv 69 \\mod 100$\n- $9^8 \\equiv 21 \\mod 100$\n- $9^9 \\equiv 89 \\mod 100$\n- $9^{10} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100$\nThe powers of 9 modulo 100 repeat every 10 powers.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the pattern to $9^{2004}$\nGiven that $9^{10} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100$, we divide 2004 by 10 to find the remainder, which tells us where in the pattern $9^{2004}$ falls. $2004 \\div 10 = 200$ remainder $4$. This means $9^{2004} \\equiv (9^{10})^{200} \\cdot 9^4 \\equiv 1^{200} \\cdot 9^4 \\equiv 9^4 \\mod 100$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $9^4 \\mod 100$ to find the last two digits\nWe already calculated $9^4 \\equiv 61 \\mod 100$ in step 2. Thus, the last two digits of $9^{2004}$ are 61.\n\n## Step 5: Sum the tens digit and the units digit\nThe tens digit is 6 and the units digit is 1. The sum of these digits is $6 + 1 = 7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
