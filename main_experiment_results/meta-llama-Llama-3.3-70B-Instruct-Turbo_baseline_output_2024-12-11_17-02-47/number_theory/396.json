    "problem": "What is the base $2$ representation of $84_{10}$?",
    "solution": "We first find that the largest power of $2$ that is less than $84$ is $2^6 = 64$. Our next step is to find the largest power of $2$ that is less than $84 - 64 = 20$ which is $2^4=16$. This leaves us left with $20 - 16 = 4$, but $4 = 2 ^2$, so we have $$84 = 1 \\cdot 2^6 + 0 \\cdot 2^5 + 1 \\cdot 2^4 + 0 \\cdot 2^3 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 0 \\cdot 2^0.$$Thus, our base $2$ representation of $84_{10}$ is $\\boxed{1010100_2}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to convert the decimal number $84_{10}$ to its binary representation in base $2$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the conversion process\nTo convert a decimal number to binary, we repeatedly divide the decimal number by $2$ and record the remainders until the quotient becomes $0$. The remainders, read from bottom to top, give the binary representation.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the conversion process\nStart dividing $84$ by $2$ and record the remainders:\n- $84 \\div 2 = 42$ remainder $0$\n- $42 \\div 2 = 21$ remainder $0$\n- $21 \\div 2 = 10$ remainder $1$\n- $10 \\div 2 = 5$ remainder $0$\n- $5 \\div 2 = 2$ remainder $1$\n- $2 \\div 2 = 1$ remainder $0$\n- $1 \\div 2 = 0$ remainder $1$\n\n## Step 4: Write the binary representation\nReading the remainders from the last step to the first gives the binary representation: $1010100_2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10101002}$"
