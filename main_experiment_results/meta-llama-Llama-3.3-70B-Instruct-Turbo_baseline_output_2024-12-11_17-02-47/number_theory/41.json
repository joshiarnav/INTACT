    "problem": "If $k$ and $\\ell$ are positive 4-digit integers such that $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$, what is the smallest possible value for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$?",
    "solution": "The identity $\\gcd(k,\\ell)\\cdot\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = k\\ell$ holds for all positive integers $k$ and $\\ell$. Thus, we have $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = \\frac{k\\ell}{3}.$$Also, $k$ and $\\ell$ must be 4-digit multiples of $3$, so our choices for each are $$1002,1005,1008,1011,1014,\\ldots,$$and by minimizing the product $k\\ell$, we minimize the least common multiple of $k$ and $\\ell$. However, $k$ and $\\ell$ cannot both be $1002$, since their greatest common divisor would then be $1002$ (not $3$). Setting $k=1002$ and $\\ell=1005$, we obtain $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$ as desired, and we obtain the smallest possible value for the least common multiple: \\begin{align*}\n\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[1002,1005] &= \\frac{1002\\cdot 1005}{3} \\\\\n&= 1002\\cdot 335 \\\\\n&= (1000\\cdot 335)+(2\\cdot 335)\\\\\n&= \\boxed{335{,}670}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the relationship between gcd and lcm\nThe product of the gcd (greatest common divisor) and lcm (least common multiple) of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers. Thus, $\\gcd(k,\\ell) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = k\\ell$.\n\n## Step 2: Express lcm in terms of gcd\nFrom the relationship in step 1, we can express $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$ as $\\frac{k\\ell}{\\gcd(k,\\ell)}$. Given $\\gcd(k,\\ell) = 3$, the equation simplifies to $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = \\frac{k\\ell}{3}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the conditions for k and l\nSince $k$ and $\\ell$ are positive 4-digit integers and $\\gcd(k,\\ell) = 3$, both $k$ and $\\ell$ must be multiples of 3 but cannot be multiples of any higher power of 3 or any other prime number that would increase their gcd beyond 3.\n\n## Step 4: Find the smallest possible values for k and l\nThe smallest 4-digit multiple of 3 is 1002. However, to minimize $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$, we need $k$ and $\\ell$ to be as small as possible while still meeting the condition that their gcd is exactly 3. Thus, we can choose $k = 1002$ and $\\ell = 1005$, as these are the smallest 4-digit numbers that are multiples of 3 and have a gcd of 3.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the smallest possible lcm\nSubstitute $k = 1002$ and $\\ell = 1005$ into the formula $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = \\frac{k\\ell}{3}$. Thus, $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[1002,1005] = \\frac{1002 \\cdot 1005}{3}$.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the calculation\nCalculate $\\frac{1002 \\cdot 1005}{3} = \\frac{1007010}{3} = 335670$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{335670}$"
