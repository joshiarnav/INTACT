    "problem": "What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}?$",
    "solution": "First, we simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$ to $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, we have $$17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$This means that $17n$ can be written in the form $7a+2$, where $a$ is an integer. So we have $17n=7a+2$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\\frac{7a+2}{17}=n$ is an integer. By trying values for $a$, we find that the smallest integer $a$ which satisfies the equation is $7$. Therefore, the least value for $n$ is $\\frac{51}{17}=\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the concept of modular arithmetic\nWe are asked to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$. This means that when $17n$ is divided by $7$, the remainder is the same as when $1234$ is divided by $7$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$\nFirst, let's simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$. We divide $1234$ by $7$ to find the remainder. $1234 \\div 7 = 176$ with a remainder of $2$. Therefore, $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify $17 \\pmod{7}$\nNext, simplify $17 \\pmod{7}$. $17$ divided by $7$ gives $2$ with a remainder of $3$. Thus, $17 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n## Step 4: Rewrite the original equation with simplifications\nNow, we can rewrite the original equation as $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, since $17 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ and $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the multiplicative inverse of $3 \\pmod{7}$\nTo solve for $n$, we need the multiplicative inverse of $3 \\pmod{7}$. The multiplicative inverse of $3 \\pmod{7}$ is an integer $x$ such that $3x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. By trying out numbers or using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that $5$ is the multiplicative inverse of $3 \\pmod{7}$ because $3 \\times 5 = 15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $n$\nUsing the multiplicative inverse, we multiply both sides of the equation $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$ by $5$. This gives $5 \\times 3n \\equiv 5 \\times 2 \\pmod{7}$, which simplifies to $n \\equiv 10 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify $n \\equiv 10 \\pmod{7}$\nFinally, simplify $n \\equiv 10 \\pmod{7}$. Since $10$ divided by $7$ gives $1$ with a remainder of $3$, $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$. Thus, the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the original equation is $3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
