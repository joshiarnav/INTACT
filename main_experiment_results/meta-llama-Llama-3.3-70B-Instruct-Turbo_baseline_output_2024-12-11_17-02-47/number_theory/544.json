    "problem": "When Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 5, she has 3 remaining, and when she divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 remaining. If Claire has fewer than 60 cupcakes, what is the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that she could have?",
    "solution": "If Claire has $N$ cupcakes, we know that $N = 5x+3$ and $N = 7y+4$ for some integers $x$ and $y$. Equating these two forms of $N$, we have $7y+1=5x$. We also know that $N<60$. We can write out all the sufficiently small possible values of $7y+1$: $$1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57.$$Of these, the numbers that are also of the form $5x$ are $15$ and $50$. These correspond to solutions $N=18,$ $N=53$. Thus, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes is $53+18 = \\boxed{71}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nClaire has a certain number of cupcakes, and when she divides them into groups of 5, she has 3 cupcakes remaining. Similarly, when she divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 cupcakes remaining.\n\n## Step 2: Formulate equations based on the problem statement\nLet's denote the total number of cupcakes as N. We can write two equations based on the given information:\nN = 5x + 3\nN = 7y + 4\nwhere x and y are integers representing the number of groups of 5 and 7 cupcakes, respectively.\n\n## Step 3: Find the possible values of N\nWe need to find the values of N that satisfy both equations. To do this, we can set the two equations equal to each other:\n5x + 3 = 7y + 4\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n5x - 7y = 1\n\n## Step 4: Solve the linear Diophantine equation\nWe need to find integer solutions to the equation 5x - 7y = 1. One way to solve this is by using the method of substitution or by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5 and 7 using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n## Step 5: Find a particular solution\nA particular solution to the equation 5x - 7y = 1 is x = 3 and y = 2, as 5(3) - 7(2) = 15 - 14 = 1.\n\n## Step 6: Find the general solution\nThe general solution to the equation 5x - 7y = 1 is given by:\nx = 3 + 7k\ny = 2 + 5k\nwhere k is an integer.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute the general solution back into one of the original equations\nSubstituting x = 3 + 7k into the equation N = 5x + 3, we get:\nN = 5(3 + 7k) + 3\nN = 15 + 35k + 3\nN = 18 + 35k\n\n## Step 8: Find the possible values of N that are less than 60\nWe need to find the values of k that result in N < 60. We can plug in different values of k and check if N is less than 60.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the possible values of N\nFor k = 0, N = 18 + 35(0) = 18.\nFor k = 1, N = 18 + 35(1) = 53.\nFor k = 2, N = 18 + 35(2) = 88, which is greater than 60, so we stop here.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the sum of all possible values of N\nThe sum of all possible values of N is 18 + 53 = 71.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{71}$"
