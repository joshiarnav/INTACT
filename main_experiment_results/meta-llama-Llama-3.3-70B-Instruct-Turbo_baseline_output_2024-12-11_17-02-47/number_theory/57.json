    "problem": "When three positive integers are divided by $24$, the remainders are $10,$ $4,$ and $12,$ respectively.\n\nWhen the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, what is the remainder?",
    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 10\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 12\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 10+4+12 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $24$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and what is given\nWe are given three positive integers which, when divided by 24, leave remainders of 10, 4, and 12, respectively. We need to find the remainder when the sum of these three integers is divided by 24.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the integers based on the given remainders\nLet's denote the three integers as $a$, $b$, and $c$. Based on the given information, we can represent $a$, $b$, and $c$ as $a = 24p + 10$, $b = 24q + 4$, and $c = 24r + 12$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are integers.\n\n## Step 3: Sum the three integers\nThe sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ can be expressed as $S = a + b + c = (24p + 10) + (24q + 4) + (24r + 12)$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression for the sum\nCombining like terms, $S = 24p + 24q + 24r + 10 + 4 + 12 = 24(p + q + r) + 26$.\n\n## Step 5: Express the sum in terms of 24 to find the remainder\nWe can further simplify $S$ as $S = 24(p + q + r) + 24 + 2$, since $26 = 24 + 2$. This means $S = 24(p + q + r + 1) + 2$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the remainder when the sum is divided by 24\nFrom the expression $S = 24(p + q + r + 1) + 2$, it's clear that when $S$ is divided by 24, the remainder will be 2, because $24(p + q + r + 1)$ is divisible by 24, leaving the remainder dependent on the \"+2\".\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
