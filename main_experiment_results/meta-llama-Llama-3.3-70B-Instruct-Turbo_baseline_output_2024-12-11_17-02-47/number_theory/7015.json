    "solution": "$n^3 \\equiv 888 \\pmod{1000} \\implies n^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ and $n^3 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125}$. $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$ due to the last digit of $n^3$. Let $n = 5a + 2$. By expanding, $125a^3 + 150a^2 + 60a + 8 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125} \\implies 5a^2 + 12a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$.\nBy looking at the last digit again, we see $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod5$, so we let $a = 5a_1 + 3$ where $a_1 \\in \\mathbb{Z^+}$. Plugging this in to $5a^2 + 12a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$ gives $10a_1 + 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$. Obviously, $a_1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$, so we let $a_1 = 5a_2 + 2$ where $a_2$ can be any non-negative integer.\nTherefore, $n = 2 + 5(3+ 5(2+5a_2)) = 125a_2 + 67$. $n^3$ must also be a multiple of $8$, so $n$ must be even. $125a_2 + 67 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2 \\implies a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Therefore, $a_2 = 2a_3 + 1$, where $a_3$ is any non-negative integer. The number $n$ has form $125(2a_3+1)+67 = 250a_3+192$. So the minimum $n = \\boxed{192}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and what is being asked\nWe are looking for the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n^3$ ends in $888$. This means that when we cube the number $n$, the last three digits should be $888$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the pattern of cubes modulo 1000\nTo find the pattern, we need to consider how the last three digits of a number behave when cubed. We can use modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. Specifically, we are interested in finding $n$ such that $n^3 \\equiv 888 \\pmod{1000}$.\n\n## Step 3: Break down the modular equation\nThe modular equation $n^3 \\equiv 888 \\pmod{1000}$ can be broken down into two separate modular equations: $n^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ and $n^3 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125}$, due to $888 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ and $888 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125}$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the first modular equation\nFor $n^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$, any even number $n$ will satisfy this condition because the cube of an even number is always divisible by $8$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the second modular equation\nFor $n^3 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125}$, we need to find a number $n$ such that when cubed, it leaves a remainder of $13$ when divided by $125$. This requires checking numbers or using a more systematic approach like using the Chinese Remainder Theorem or noticing patterns in cubes modulo $125$.\n\n## Step 6: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem or inspection to find n\nBy inspecting cubes or using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can find the smallest $n$ that satisfies both conditions. Noting that $n=2$ satisfies the first condition, we then look for a number that satisfies the second condition and is even.\n\n## Step 7: Find the solution by inspection or trial and error\nAfter checking several numbers, we find that $n = 192$ is the smallest positive integer whose cube ends in $888$ because $192^3 = 7077888$, which indeed ends in $888$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{192}$"
