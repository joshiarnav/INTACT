    "problem": "Call a positive integer $N$ a 7-10 double if the digits of the base-$7$ representation of $N$ form a base-$10$ number that is twice $N$. For example, $51$ is a 7-10 double because its base-$7$ representation is $102$. What is the largest 7-10 double?\n",
    "solution": "We let $N_7 = \\overline{a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0}_7$; we are given that\n\\[2(a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_7 = (a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_{10}\\](This is because the digits in $N$ ' s base 7 representation make a number with the same digits in base 10 when multiplied by 2)\nExpanding, we find that\n\\[2 \\cdot 7^n a_n + 2 \\cdot 7^{n-1} a_{n-1} + \\cdots + 2a_0 = 10^na_n + 10^{n-1}a_{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0\\]\nor re-arranging,\n\\[a_0 + 4a_1 = 2a_2 + 314a_3 + \\cdots + (10^n - 2 \\cdot 7^n)a_n\\]\nSince the $a_i$s are base-$7$ digits, it follows that $a_i < 7$, and the LHS is less than or equal to $30$. Hence our number can have at most $3$ digits in base-$7$. Letting $a_2 = 6$, we find that $630_7 = \\boxed{315}_{10}$ is our largest 7-10 double.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem and understand what is being asked\nWe need to find the largest positive integer $N$ that, when represented in base-7 and the digits of that representation are read as a base-10 number, that base-10 number is exactly twice the value of $N$.\n\n## Step 2: Establish the base-7 to base-10 conversion process\nTo convert a number from base-7 to base-10, we multiply each digit by 7 raised to the power of its position from right to left, starting at 0. For example, the base-7 number $102_7$ is equal to $1*7^2 + 0*7^1 + 2*7^0 = 49 + 0 + 2 = 51_{10}$.\n\n## Step 3: Define the condition for a 7-10 double\nLet $N$ be the number in base-10, and let its base-7 representation be $d_nd_{n-1}...d_1d_0$. The value of $N$ in base-10 is $d_0*7^0 + d_1*7^1 + ... + d_{n-1}*7^{n-1} + d_n*7^n$. The condition for $N$ to be a 7-10 double is that $d_nd_{n-1}...d_1d_0$ in base-10 is equal to $2N$. Thus, $d_n*10^n + d_{n-1}*10^{n-1} + ... + d_1*10^1 + d_0*10^0 = 2*(d_0*7^0 + d_1*7^1 + ... + d_{n-1}*7^{n-1} + d_n*7^n)$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the possible number of digits in base-7 for the largest 7-10 double\nSince we are looking for the largest such $N$, we start by considering the number of digits in its base-7 representation. The more digits, the larger the number. However, the relationship between the base-7 and base-10 representations imposes a limit on how large $N$ can be.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the limitations and constraints\nEach digit in the base-7 representation can be at most 6 (since the base is 7), which limits the possible values when converting back to base-10. Additionally, the base-10 number formed by the digits must be exactly twice the original number, which further constrains the possible values.\n\n## Step 6: Start with the highest possible digit for the most significant digit in base-7\nSince we're looking for the largest $N$, we start with the highest possible digit in base-7, which is 6, for the most significant digit.\n\n## Step 7: Test with a 3-digit number in base-7\nLet's consider a 3-digit number in base-7, $abc_7$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits in base-7. The value in base-10 is $a*7^2 + b*7^1 + c*7^0 = 49a + 7b + c$. The condition for it to be a 7-10 double is $100a + 10b + c = 2*(49a + 7b + c)$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the equation for a 3-digit number\nSimplifying the equation gives $100a + 10b + c = 98a + 14b + 2c$, which further simplifies to $2a - 4b - c = 0$.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the limitations of base-7 digits\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits in base-7, they are integers from 0 to 6. We need to find values that satisfy the equation $2a - 4b - c = 0$ under these constraints.\n\n## Step 10: Test possible values for $a$, $b$, and $c$\nGiven that we are looking for the largest possible $N$, we start testing with the largest possible value for $a$, which is 6.\n\n## Step 11: Solve for $b$ and $c$ with $a = 6$\nSubstituting $a = 6$ into the equation gives $12 - 4b - c = 0$, or $4b + c = 12$. Considering the base-7 constraints, possible values for $b$ and $c$ that satisfy this equation need to be found.\n\n## Step 12: Find suitable $b$ and $c$\nTesting values for $b$ and $c$ that satisfy $4b + c = 12$ and are valid base-7 digits (0 to 6) is necessary.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate $b = 3$ and solve for $c$\nIf $b = 3$, then $12 - 4*3 = 0$, which means $c = 0$. This gives a potential solution where $a = 6$, $b = 3$, and $c = 0$.\n\n## Step 14: Convert the base-7 number to base-10 and verify\nThe base-7 number $630_7$ converts to $6*7^2 + 3*7^1 + 0*7^0 = 294 + 21 + 0 = 315_{10}$. The base-10 number formed by the digits is $630_{10}$. We need to verify if $630_{10}$ is indeed twice $315_{10}$.\n\n## Step 15: Verify the condition for a 7-10 double\n$630_{10}$ is exactly twice $315_{10}$, as $2 * 315 = 630$. Thus, $315$ is a 7-10 double.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{315}$"
