    "problem": "Find the least odd prime factor of $2019^8+1$.\n",
    "solution": "We know that $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ for some prime $p$. We want to find the smallest odd possible value of $p$. By squaring both sides of the congruence, we find $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is a positive divisor of $16$.\nHowever, if the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $1, 2, 4,$ or $8,$ then $2019^8$ will be equivalent to $1 \\pmod{p},$ which contradicts the given requirement that $2019^8\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$.\nTherefore, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $16$. Because all orders modulo $p$ divide $\\phi(p)$, we see that $\\phi(p)$ is a multiple of $16$. As $p$ is prime, $\\phi(p) = p\\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{p}\\right) = p - 1$. Therefore, $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$. The two smallest primes equivalent to $1 \\pmod{16}$ are $17$ and $97$. As $2019^8 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$ and $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{97}$, the smallest possible $p$ is thus $\\boxed{97}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nWe need to find the least odd prime factor of the expression $2019^8+1$.\n\n## Step 2: Utilize the properties of modular arithmetic\nTo approach this problem, we can use modular arithmetic, specifically focusing on properties related to prime numbers and congruences.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the concept of orders of numbers modulo p\nFor a prime $p$, if $2019^8\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$, then $2019^{16}\\equiv 1\\pmod{p}$. This implies that the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is a positive divisor of $16$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze possible orders of 2019 modulo p\nHowever, if the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $1, 2, 4,$ or $8$, then $2019^8$ will be equivalent to $1\\pmod{p}$, which contradicts the requirement that $2019^8\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the order of 2019 modulo p\nThus, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $16$. Because all orders modulo $p$ divide $\\phi(p)$, where $\\phi(p)$ is Euler's totient function, we have that $\\phi(p)$ is a multiple of $16$.\n\n## Step 6: Apply Euler's totient function properties for prime p\nAs $p$ is prime, $\\phi(p) = p\\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{p}\\right) = p - 1$. Therefore, $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$.\n\n## Step 7: Find the smallest prime equivalent to 1 modulo 16\nThe two smallest primes equivalent to $1 \\pmod{16}$ are $17$ and $97$.\n\n## Step 8: Test the primes 17 and 97\nWe need to check whether $2019^8$ satisfies the congruence $2019^8\\equiv -1\\pmod{17}$ or $2019^8\\equiv -1\\pmod{97}$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the congruence modulo 17\nCalculating $2019^8 \\pmod{17}$, we find $2019^8 \\not\\equiv -1\\pmod{17}$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the congruence modulo 97\nCalculating $2019^8 \\pmod{97}$, we find $2019^8 \\equiv -1\\pmod{97}$.\n\n## Step 11: Determine the least odd prime factor\nTherefore, the smallest possible $p$ is $\\boxed{97}$.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{97}$"
