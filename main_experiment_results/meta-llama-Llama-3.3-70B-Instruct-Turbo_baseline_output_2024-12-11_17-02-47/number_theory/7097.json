Now, there are $242$ factors of $11$, so $11^{242} \\mid m^m$, and then $m = 11k$ for $k \\geq 22$. Now, $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = \\gcd(11+k,210) = 1$. Noting $k = 26$ is the minimal that satisfies this, we get $(n,m) = (121,286)$. Thus, it is easy to verify this is minimal and we get $\\boxed{407}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given conditions\nThe problem gives us three conditions to work with: $\\gcd(m+n,210)=1$, $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$, and $m$ is not a multiple of $n$. We need to find the least possible value of $m+n$ that satisfies all these conditions.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the condition $\\gcd(m+n,210)=1$\nThis condition implies that the sum $m+n$ should not share any common factors with $210$, other than $1$. The prime factorization of $210$ is $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7$. So, $m+n$ cannot be divisible by $2, 3, 5,$ or $7$.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the condition $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$\nThis condition suggests that $m$ and $n$ should be related in such a way that $m^m$ contains all the prime factors of $n^n$. Since $m$ is not a multiple of $n$, $n$ must have prime factors that are present in $m$, but the powers of these factors in $m$ are less than in $n$.\n\n## Step 4: Explore possible values for $n$ based on its prime factorization\nLet's consider the prime factorization of $n$. If $n$ is a prime power, say $n = p^k$, then $m$ must contain $p$ in its factorization, but with a lower power than $k$. This implies $m = p^j$ where $j < k$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine a suitable $n$ and $m$ to satisfy the conditions\nTaking the lowest prime not included in the factorization of $210$, which is $11$, we can consider $n$ as a power of $11$. If $n = 11^2 = 121$, then for $m^m$ to be a multiple of $n^n = 121^{121}$, $m$ must include $11$ in its prime factorization, but not be a multiple of $121$. So, $m$ could be $11k$ where $k$ is not a multiple of $11$.\n\n## Step 6: Find a value of $m$ that works with $n = 121$\nFor the smallest possible $m$ that satisfies the condition $m^m$ is a multiple of $121^{121}$, we can choose $m = 11k$ where $k$ is chosen such that $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1$. The lowest $k$ that satisfies these conditions and also ensures $m+n$ is minimal needs to be determined.\n\n## Step 7: Consider $k = 1$ to get the smallest possible $m$\nIf $k = 1$, then $m = 11$. However, $m = 11$ and $n = 121$ do not satisfy the condition $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1$ because $m+n = 132$ is divisible by $2$ and $3$, which are factors of $210$.\n\n## Step 8: Choose $k$ to satisfy $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1$\nWe need to find the smallest $k$ such that $11k + 121$ is not divisible by $2, 3, 5,$ or $7$. Trying $k = 2, 3, 4...$ until we find a suitable $k$ that makes $m+n$ coprime with $210$.\n\n## Step 9: Test $k = 26$ to ensure $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1$\nFor $k = 26$, $m = 11 \\times 26 = 286$ and $n = 121$. Then, $m+n = 407$. Checking if $407$ is coprime with $210$, we find that $\\gcd(407, 210) = 1$ because $407$ is a prime number and does not share any factors with $210$.\n\n## Step 10: Verify that $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$\nWith $m = 286$ and $n = 121$, we need to verify that $286^{286}$ is indeed a multiple of $121^{121}$. Since $286 = 2 \\times 11 \\times 13$ and $121 = 11^2$, $286^{286}$ will contain the factor $11^{572}$, ensuring it's a multiple of $121^{121}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{407}$"
