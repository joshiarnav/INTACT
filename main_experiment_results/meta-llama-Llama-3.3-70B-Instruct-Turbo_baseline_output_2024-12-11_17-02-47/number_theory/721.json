    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3, we first need to understand what it means for a number to be odd and a multiple of 3.\n## Step 2:  An odd number is any integer that cannot be exactly divided by 2. Examples of odd numbers include 1, 3, 5, and so on.\n## Step 3:  A multiple of 3 is any number that can be divided by 3 without leaving a remainder. Examples of multiples of 3 include 3, 6, 9, and so on.\n## Step 4:  Combining these two conditions, we're looking for numbers that are odd and can be divided by 3. This means we're looking for odd multiples of 3.\n## Step 5:  The sequence of odd multiples of 3 starts with 3, then 9, 15, 21, and so on. This is because we're adding 6 (which is 2 times 3) to get from one odd multiple of 3 to the next.\n## Step 6:  To find the tenth number in this sequence, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the term number, and $d$ is the common difference.\n## Step 7:  Here, $a_1 = 3$ (the first odd multiple of 3), $d = 6$ (the common difference between consecutive odd multiples of 3), and $n = 10$ (since we're looking for the tenth term).\n## Step 8:  Plugging these values into the formula gives us $a_{10} = 3 + (10-1)6 = 3 + 9*6 = 3 + 54 = 57$.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is 57.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57}$"
