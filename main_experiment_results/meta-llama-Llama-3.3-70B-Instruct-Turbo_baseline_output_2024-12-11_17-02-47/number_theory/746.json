    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks to find an integer $n$ such that when $-3737$ is divided by $8$, the remainder is $n$. This is represented by the congruence $n \\equiv -3737 \\pmod{8}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the remainder when -3737 is divided by 8\nTo find $n$, we need to calculate the remainder when $-3737$ is divided by $8$. This can be done by performing the division: $-3737 \\div 8$.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the division\n$-3737$ divided by $8$ equals $-467$ with a remainder of $7$, since $-3737 = -467 \\times 8 + 7$. This means $-3737$ is $7$ more than a multiple of $8$.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the value of $n$\nSince $n$ is the remainder when $-3737$ is divided by $8$, and we found that remainder to be $7$, $n$ must be $7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
