    "model_solution": "## Step 1: We start by expressing the given decimal as a fraction to make it easier to work with.\nGiven $\\frac{a}{a+27} = 0.865$, we first convert 0.865 to a fraction. Since $0.865 = \\frac{865}{1000} = \\frac{173}{200}$, we have $\\frac{a}{a+27} = \\frac{173}{200}$.\n\n## Step 2: Now, we set up an equation using the given fraction and solve for $a$.\nBy cross-multiplying, we get $200a = 173(a + 27)$. Expanding this equation, we have $200a = 173a + 4671$.\n\n## Step 3: Solving for $a$ involves isolating $a$ on one side of the equation.\nSubtracting $173a$ from both sides gives $27a = 4671$. Then, dividing both sides by 27 yields $a = \\frac{4671}{27}$.\n\n## Step 4: Finally, calculate the value of $a$.\nCalculating the value gives $a = 173$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{173}$"
