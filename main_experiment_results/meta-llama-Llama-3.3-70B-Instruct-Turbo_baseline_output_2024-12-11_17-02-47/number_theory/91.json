    "problem": "For some positive integer $k$, when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. What is the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$?",
    "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the problem statement\nWe are given that when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. This can be represented as $60 \\equiv 6 \\mod k^2$. We need to find the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplifying the given congruence\nThe given congruence $60 \\equiv 6 \\mod k^2$ can be simplified to $60 - 6 \\equiv 0 \\mod k^2$, which gives us $54 \\equiv 0 \\mod k^2$. This implies that $k^2$ divides 54.\n\n## Step 3: Finding the factors of 54\nWe need to find the factors of 54 to determine the possible values of $k$. The factors of 54 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54.\n\n## Step 4: Identifying perfect square factors\nSince $k^2$ must divide 54, we look for perfect square factors of 54. The perfect square factors are 1 and 9.\n\n## Step 5: Determining the possible values of $k$\nGiven that $k^2$ can be 1 or 9, the possible values of $k$ are 1 and 3, since $k$ must be a positive integer.\n\n## Step 6: Checking the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$\nFor $k = 1$, the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$ is 0. For $k = 3$, the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$ is 1.\n\n## Step 7: Selecting the appropriate value of $k$\nSince $k$ must be a positive integer and we are looking for a non-trivial solution (i.e., $k \\neq 1$), we choose $k = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
