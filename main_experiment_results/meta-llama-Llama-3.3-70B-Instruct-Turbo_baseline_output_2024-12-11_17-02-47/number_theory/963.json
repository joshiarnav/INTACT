    "problem": "The arithmetic progressions $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$ and $\\{3, 10, 17, 24, \\ldots \\}$ have some common values. What is the largest value less than 500 that they have in common?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be a common term. We know that \\begin{align*}\na&\\equiv 2\\pmod 3\\\\\na&\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer such that $a=2+3n$. Substituting this into $(2)$ yields \\[2+3n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 5\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $5$. Then $n\\ge 5\\implies a=2+3n\\ge 17$. $17$ satisfies the original congruences, so it is the smallest common term. Subtracting $17$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align*}\na-17&\\equiv -15\\equiv 0\\pmod 3\\nonumber\\\\\na-17&\\equiv -14\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\\nonumber\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,7)$, we get $a-17\\equiv 0\\pmod{3\\cdot 7}$, that is, $a\\equiv 17\\pmod{21}$.\n\nSo all common terms must be of the form $17+21m$ for some non-negative integer $m$. Note that any number of the form also satisfies the original congruences. The largest such number less than $500$ is $17+21\\cdot 22=\\boxed{479}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the common difference in the first arithmetic progression\nThe common difference in the first arithmetic progression is $5 - 2 = 3$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the common difference in the second arithmetic progression\nThe common difference in the second arithmetic progression is $10 - 3 = 7$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the first term where the progressions could potentially intersect\nTo find where the two progressions intersect, we can set up an equation where the terms of the two progressions are equal. Let $2 + 3n = 3 + 7m$, where $n$ and $m$ are integers representing the term numbers in the first and second progressions, respectively.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for the relationship between n and m\nRearranging the equation $2 + 3n = 3 + 7m$ gives $3n - 7m = 1$. This is a linear Diophantine equation. To solve it, we need to find integers $n$ and $m$ that satisfy this equation.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the Diophantine equation\nUsing the method of finding a particular solution and then the general solution, a particular solution can be found by inspection or systematically. A particular solution is $n = 5$ and $m = 2$ because $3*5 - 7*2 = 15 - 14 = 1$. The general solution for $n$ and $m$ can be expressed as $n = 5 + 7k$ and $m = 2 + 3k$, where $k$ is any integer.\n\n## Step 6: Find the first few common terms\nSubstitute $n = 5 + 7k$ into the equation for the first arithmetic progression: $2 + 3(5 + 7k) = 17 + 21k$. This represents the common terms. To find the first common term, let $k = 0$: $17 + 21*0 = 17$. This confirms that 17 is a common term.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the largest common value less than 500\nNow, we need to find the largest value of $k$ such that $17 + 21k < 500$. We solve the inequality $17 + 21k < 500$ for $k$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the inequality for k\n$17 + 21k < 500$ implies $21k < 483$, which implies $k < 483 / 21$. Calculating $483 / 21$ gives approximately $23.00$. Therefore, the largest integer $k$ that satisfies the inequality is $22$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the largest common value less than 500\nSubstitute $k = 22$ into $17 + 21k$ to find the largest common value less than 500: $17 + 21*22 = 17 + 462 = 479$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{479}$"
