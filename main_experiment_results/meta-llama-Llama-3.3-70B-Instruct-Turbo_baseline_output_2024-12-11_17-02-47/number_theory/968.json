    "problem": "Three different natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors. How many factors does $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ have?",
    "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the property of the number of factors of a given number\nA number with exactly three natural-number factors must be the square of a prime number, because the only factors of such a number are 1, the prime number itself, and the square of the prime number.\n\n## Step 2: Express x, y, and z in terms of squares of prime numbers\nLet's denote x, y, and z as $p^{2}$, $q^{2}$, and $r^{2}$ respectively, where p, q, and r are distinct prime numbers.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$\n$x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ = $(p^{2})^{2}(q^{2})^{3}(r^{2})^{4}$ = $p^{4}q^{6}r^{8}$.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the formula for the number of factors of a given number\nThe number of factors of a given number $a^{m}b^{n}c^{o}$, where a, b, and c are distinct prime numbers, is (m+1)(n+1)(o+1).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$\nThe number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ = (4+1)(6+1)(8+1) = 5 * 7 * 9 = 315.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{315}$"
