    "problem": "Natural numbers of the form $F_n=2^{2^n} + 1 $ are called Fermat numbers. In 1640, Fermat conjectured that all numbers $F_n$, where $n\\neq 0$, are prime. (The conjecture was later shown to be false.) What is the units digit of $F_{1000}$?",
    "solution": "Let's first try to find the cycle of units digits of $2^n$, starting with $n=1$: $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $2^n$ is 4 digits long: 2, 4, 8, 6. To find the units digit of $2^n$, for any positive integer $n$, we simply need to find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 2, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 4, etc.) Since $2^{1000}\\div4=2^{998}$ without remainder, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6. Therefore, the units digit of $F_n=2^{2^{1000}}+1$ is $6+1=\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the definition of Fermat numbers\nFermat numbers are defined as $F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the pattern for the units digit of $2^n$\nTo find the units digit of $F_{1000}$, we first need to find the pattern for the units digit of $2^n$. When we calculate the units digits of successive powers of 2, we get the sequence 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, ... . This sequence repeats every 4 powers.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the exponent modulo 4\nSince the pattern repeats every 4 powers, we need to find $2^{1000}$ modulo 4. $2^{1000}$ mod 4 is equivalent to finding the remainder when $2^{1000}$ is divided by 4. Since $2^2 = 4$, any even power of 2 is divisible by 4, leaving a remainder of 0 when divided by 4, but we are interested in $2^{2^{1000}}$. We need to find $2^{1000}$ mod 4 to determine which part of the cycle $2^{2^{1000}}$ falls into.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $2^{1000}$ mod 4\nAny integer power of 2, when divided by 4, will have a remainder of 0 if the exponent is even and greater than 0, because $2^2 = 4$. Therefore, $2^{1000}$ mod 4 equals 0.\n\n## Step 5: Apply this to $2^{2^{1000}}$\nHowever, the fact that $2^{1000}$ mod 4 equals 0 doesn't directly tell us the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$. Instead, we look at the pattern of units digits for $2^n$ and consider that $2^{2^{1000}}$ will have the same units digit as $2^4$, $2^8$, $2^{12}$, etc., because these are the powers of 2 that are themselves powers of 2 (i.e., $2^{2n}$). The units digit of $2^4$ is 6.\n\n## Step 6: Find the units digit of $F_{1000}$\nGiven $F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1$, the units digit of $F_{1000}$ will be the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}} + 1$. Since the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6, adding 1 gives us a units digit of 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
