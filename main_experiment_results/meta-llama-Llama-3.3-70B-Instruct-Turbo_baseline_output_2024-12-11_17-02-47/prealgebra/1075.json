    "problem": "There is a committee composed of eight women and two men. When they meet, they sit in a row---the women in indistinguishable rocking chairs and the men on indistinguishable stools.  How many distinct ways are there for me to arrange the eight chairs and two stools for a meeting?",
    "solution": "Because the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from each other and the stools are indistinguishable from each other, we can think of first placing the two stools somewhere in the ten slots and then filling the rest with rocking chairs. The first stool has $10$ slots in which it can go, and the second has $9$. However, because they are indistinguishable from each other, we have overcounted the number of ways to place the stools by a factor of $2$, so we divide by $2$. Thus, there are $\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = \\boxed{45}$ distinct ways to arrange the ten chairs and stools for a meeting.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the type of problem\nThis problem is about arranging items with repetition. Since the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from each other, as are the stools, we are essentially looking to find the number of ways to choose the positions for the stools (or equivalently, the rocking chairs) in the row.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the formula for arranging items with repetition\nWhen arranging items with repetition, the formula to use is the combination formula, which in this context can be thought of as choosing the positions for one type of item (e.g., the stools) out of the total number of positions. The formula for combinations is given by $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items to arrange, $r$ is the number of items of one type (e.g., the number of stools), and $n!$ denotes the factorial of $n$, which is the product of all positive integers up to $n$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the formula to the given problem\nIn this problem, we have $n = 10$ total positions (8 women + 2 men) and we want to choose the positions for the $r = 2$ stools. Plugging these values into the combination formula gives us $\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \\frac{10!}{2!8!}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying the factorial terms gives $\\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{45}$"
