    "problem": "Chloe wants to buy a hoodie that costs $\\$32.75$. She empties her wallet and finds she only has three $\\$10$ bills, eight quarters, and a pile of dimes. What is the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ represent the unknown number of dimes. Chloe's total amount of money is $$3(\\$10)+8(\\$.25)+n(\\$.10) \\ge \\$32.75.$$Simplifying gives  \\begin{align*}\n30+2+.10n &\\ge 32.75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\n.10n &\\ge .75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge \\frac{.75}{.10} \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge 7.5.\n\\end{align*}Chloe must have at least $\\boxed{8}$ dimes in her pile.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total cost of the hoodie\nThe cost of the hoodie is $32.75.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Chloe has from the $10 bills\nChloe has 3 $10 bills, which equals 3 * $10 = $30.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Chloe has from the quarters\nChloe has 8 quarters, and each quarter is $0.25. So, the total amount from quarters is 8 * $0.25 = $2.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the remaining amount needed to pay for the hoodie\nThe amount Chloe has from $10 bills and quarters is $30 + $2 = $32. The remaining amount needed is $32.75 - $32 = $0.75.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the minimum number of dimes needed to cover the remaining amount\nEach dime is worth $0.10. To find the minimum number of dimes needed, we divide the remaining amount by the value of a dime: $0.75 / $0.10 = 7.5.\n\n## Step 6: Since we cannot have a fraction of a dime, we need to round up to the nearest whole number\nWe round up 7.5 to 8, because Chloe needs at least 8 dimes to have enough money to pay for the hoodie.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
