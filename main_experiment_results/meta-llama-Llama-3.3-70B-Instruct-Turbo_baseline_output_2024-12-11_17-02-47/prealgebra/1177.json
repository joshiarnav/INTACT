    "problem": "In a right triangle with integer length sides, the hypotenuse has length 39 units. How many units is the length of the shorter leg?",
    "solution": "Since they only ask for one length, you can assume that there's only one possible triangle.  Then, quickly note that $39 = 3\\cdot 13$, and that 5 - 12 - 13 is a Pythagorean triple.  Therefore, the shorter leg has length $\\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the Pythagorean Theorem\nThe Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b), given by the formula $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$. Here, we are given that $c = 39$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem\nSubstitute $c = 39$ into the Pythagorean Theorem to get $39^2 = a^2 + b^2$. This simplifies to $1521 = a^2 + b^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the Possible Values for a and b\nSince $a$ and $b$ are integers and we are looking for the shorter leg, we need to find integer values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the equation $1521 = a^2 + b^2$. We also know that $a < b$ since we are looking for the length of the shorter leg.\n\n## Step 4: Factor 1521 to Find Possible Squares\nNotice that $1521 = 39^2$, and we can look for factorizations or known Pythagorean triples that might help. However, since 1521 is a square itself, we look for squares that could add up to it, keeping in mind that one side must be shorter than the other.\n\n## Step 5: Identify Relevant Pythagorean Triples\nA common method to generate Pythagorean triples does not directly apply since we're given the hypotenuse and need to find the legs. Instead, we can look for patterns or known triples that might be scaled up. Given that $39^2 = 1521$, and knowing some common Pythagorean triples, we might recall that $15^2 + 36^2 = 225 + 1296 = 1521$. This is a known Pythagorean triple (15, 36, 39).\n\n## Step 6: Determine the Shorter Leg\nFrom the identified Pythagorean triple (15, 36, 39), the shorter leg is 15 units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
