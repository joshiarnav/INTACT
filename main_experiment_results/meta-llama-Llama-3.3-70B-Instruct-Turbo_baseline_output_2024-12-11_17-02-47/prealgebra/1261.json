Then, $40\\%$ of $0.5x$ is $0.4 \\times 0.5x = 0.2x$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation to find the percentage\nLet $p$ be the percentage we're looking for. The equation is $p\\%$ of $x = 0.2x$. In mathematical terms, this is $\\frac{p}{100}x = 0.2x$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $p$\nDivide both sides of the equation by $x$ to get $\\frac{p}{100} = 0.2$. Then, multiply both sides by $100$ to solve for $p$: $p = 0.2 \\times 100 = 20$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$"
