    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the relationship between x, y, and z\nThe value of $x$ is one-half the value of $y$, which can be expressed as $x = \\frac{1}{2}y$. The value of $y$ is one-fifth the value of $z$, which can be expressed as $y = \\frac{1}{5}z$.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the given value of z into the equation for y\nGiven $z = 60$, we substitute this into the equation for $y$: $y = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 60 = 12$.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the value of y into the equation for x\nNow that we know $y = 12$, we substitute this into the equation for $x$: $x = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
