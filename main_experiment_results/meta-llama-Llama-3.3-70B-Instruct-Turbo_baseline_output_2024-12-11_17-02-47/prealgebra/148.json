    "problem": "The average of the numbers 23 and $x$ is 27. What is the positive difference between 23 and $x$? (Recall that the average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2).",
    "solution": "To calculate the average of two numbers, we add them and divide the sum by $2$.  From the given information, we have the equation  \\[\\frac{23+x}{2}=27.\\]  Multiplying both sides by $2$ yields \\[23+x=54.\\]  Thus, $x=54-23=31$.  Finally, the positive difference between $31$ and $23$ is \\[31-23=\\boxed{8}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the formula for calculating the average of two numbers.\nThe average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2. So, for the numbers 23 and $x$, the average is $(23 + x)/2$.\n\n## Step 2: Use the given information to set up an equation involving $x$.\nWe are told that the average of 23 and $x$ is 27. Using the formula from Step 1, we can write this as $(23 + x)/2 = 27$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the equation from Step 2 for $x$.\nTo solve for $x$, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2, which gives $23 + x = 54$. Subtracting 23 from both sides yields $x = 54 - 23$, so $x = 31$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the positive difference between 23 and $x$.\nThe positive difference between 23 and $x$ (which we found to be 31) is $|23 - 31| = | -8 | = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
