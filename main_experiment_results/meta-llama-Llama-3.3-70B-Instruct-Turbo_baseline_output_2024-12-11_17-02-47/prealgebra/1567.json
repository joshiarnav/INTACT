    "problem": "How many integers between 1 and 200 are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7?",
    "solution": "Integers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 must be multiples of 15.  We can start by listing the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200: $$15,30,45,60,75,90,105,120,135,150,165,180,195$$ Checking only the even numbers, we can eliminate those that are multiples of 4, leaving us with: $$15,30,45,75,90,105,135,150,165,195$$ Finally, we need to eliminate any remaining multiples of 7.  The only multiples of 7 we need to be concerned with are those ending in 5 or 0.  The only number on the list that is a multiple of 7 is 105.  Our final list is: $$15,30,45,75,90,135,150,165,195$$ This leaves us with $\\boxed{9}$ integers.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5\nTo find the integers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, we first need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5. The LCM of 3 and 5 is 15.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of multiples of 15 between 1 and 200\nNext, we need to find how many multiples of 15 are between 1 and 200. We can do this by dividing 200 by 15 and taking the floor of the result, which gives us the number of multiples of 15 that are less than or equal to 200. 200 / 15 = 13.333, so the floor is 13.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 4\nNow, we need to identify the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 4, so we can exclude them. The LCM of 15 and 4 is 60. Multiples of 60 between 1 and 200 are 60, 120, and 180.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 7\nWe also need to identify the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 7, to exclude them. The LCM of 15 and 7 is 105. The only multiple of 105 between 1 and 200 is 105.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of multiples of 15 that are not multiples of 4 or 7\nWe found that there are 13 multiples of 15 between 1 and 200. From these, we need to exclude the multiples of 60 (3 numbers) and the multiple of 105 (1 number). However, we should note that 105 is not a multiple of 4, but it is a multiple of 7 and has already been accounted for in the exclusion based on the LCM of 15 and 7. Therefore, we exclude 3 multiples of 60 and 1 multiple of 105, but since 105 is not a multiple of 4, we do not need to worry about double exclusion. Thus, 13 - 3 - 1 = 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$"
