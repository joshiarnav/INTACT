    "problem": "A 12-slice pizza was made with only pepperoni and mushroom toppings, and every slice has at least one topping. Only six slices have pepperoni, and exactly ten slices have mushrooms. How many slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms?",
    "solution": "There are 12 total slices, and 6 of them have pepperoni and 10 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number of the slices that have both toppings, so there are $6-n$ with just pepperoni and $10-n$ with just mushrooms.  Since every slice has at least one topping, and there are 12 slices, we must have $(6-n) + (10-n) + n = 12$, which gives $n=\\boxed{4}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the total number of slices and the distribution of toppings.\nWe have a 12-slice pizza. Out of these, 6 slices have pepperoni and 10 slices have mushrooms.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize that some slices must have both toppings to meet the conditions given.\nSince every slice has at least one topping, and we know the exact distribution of pepperoni and mushroom slices, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find out how many slices have both.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\nThe principle states that the total number of slices with either pepperoni or mushrooms (or both) equals the sum of slices with pepperoni and slices with mushrooms, minus the slices with both, because they were counted twice. The formula looks like this: Total = Pepperoni + Mushrooms - Both.\n\n## Step 4: Plug in the known values into the formula.\nWe know that the total number of slices with at least one topping is 12 (since every slice has at least one topping), the number of slices with pepperoni is 6, and the number of slices with mushrooms is 10. So, we have 12 = 6 + 10 - Both.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for the number of slices with both toppings.\nRearranging the equation to solve for Both, we get Both = 6 + 10 - 12.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of slices with both toppings.\nBoth = 16 - 12 = 4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
