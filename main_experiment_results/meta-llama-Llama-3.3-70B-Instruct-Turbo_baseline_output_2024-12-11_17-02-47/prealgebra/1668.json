    "solution": "The chart shows the amounts of sales at the end of each year.  Therefore we're looking for a year on the chart that has the largest difference from the previous year.    Determining the sales that increased the most number of dollars is equivalent to finding the right endpoint of the segment with the steepest slope.  From observation, we can determine that that line corresponds to the year $\\boxed{1998}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to determine the year after 1994 when the sales increased the most in terms of dollars. This means we need to find the year with the greatest difference in sales compared to the previous year.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the graph\nLooking at the graph, we can see that each point represents the end-of-year sales amount for each year. The x-axis represents the years, and the y-axis represents the sales amounts in millions of dollars.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the years and sales amounts\nFrom the graph, we can identify the years and their corresponding sales amounts:\n- 1994: 3 units (approximately $1.5 million)\n- 1996: 4 units (approximately $2 million)\n- 1998: 5 units (approximately $2.5 million)\n- 2000: 6 units (approximately $3 million)\n- 2002: 5.5 units (approximately $2.75 million)\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the differences in sales\nTo find the year with the greatest increase in sales, we need to calculate the differences in sales between consecutive years:\n- 1996-1994: 1 unit (approximately $0.5 million)\n- 1998-1996: 1 unit (approximately $0.5 million)\n- 2000-1998: 1 unit (approximately $0.5 million)\n- 2002-2000: -0.5 units (approximately -$0.25 million)\n\nHowever, we notice that there is a significant increase between 1998 and 2000. Let's examine the increase from 1996 to 1998 and from 1998 to 2000 more closely.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the year with the greatest increase\nUpon closer inspection of the graph, we see that the line segment from 1998 to 2000 is the steepest, indicating the greatest increase in sales. This corresponds to the year 2000, but since the question asks for the year after 1994 when sales increased the most, we should look for the year when this increase happened, which is 1998, as the increase from 1997 to 1998 is the largest, but the data point for 1997 is not given, however, the greatest increase is between 1997 and 1998, hence the year is 1998.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1998}$"
