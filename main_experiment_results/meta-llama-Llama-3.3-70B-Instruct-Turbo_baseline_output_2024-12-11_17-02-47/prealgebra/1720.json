    "problem": "Given three members of a group -- Alice, Bob, and Carol -- in how many ways can these three be chosen to be the three officers (president, secretary, and treasurer) of the group, assuming no person holds more than one job?",
    "solution": "In this problem we are choosing a committee, so the order in which we choose the 3 people does not matter.  We could have chosen them in any of the following orders (where A is Alice, B is Bob, and C is Carol): ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.  So each possible committee corresponds to $3! = \\boxed{6}$ possible orderings.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of positions to be filled\nThere are three positions to be filled: president, secretary, and treasurer.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of candidates for each position\nFor the position of president, there are 3 candidates (Alice, Bob, and Carol). After the president is chosen, there will be 2 candidates left for the position of secretary. Once the secretary is chosen, there will be 1 candidate left for the position of treasurer.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose the officers\nTo find the total number of ways to choose the officers, we multiply the number of candidates for each position. The number of ways to choose the president is 3, the number of ways to choose the secretary is 2 (since one person has already been chosen as president), and the number of ways to choose the treasurer is 1 (since two people have already been chosen).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways\nThe total number of ways to choose the officers is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
