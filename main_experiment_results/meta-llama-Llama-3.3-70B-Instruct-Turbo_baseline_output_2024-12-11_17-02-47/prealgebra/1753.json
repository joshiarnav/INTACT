    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a right-angled triangle $EAB$ with $BE = 9$ units. Two squares, $ABCD$ and $AEFG$, are drawn on the sides $AB$ and $AE$ of the triangle. We need to find the sum of the areas of these two squares.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean theorem\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem, in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, $BE$ is the hypotenuse, and $AB$ and $AE$ are the other two sides. So, we have $BE^2 = AB^2 + AE^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the sum of the areas of the squares\nThe area of a square is given by the formula $side^2$. Therefore, the sum of the areas of the two squares $ABCD$ and $AEFG$ is $AB^2 + AE^2$. From the Pythagorean theorem, we know that $AB^2 + AE^2 = BE^2$. Given that $BE = 9$ units, we can calculate $BE^2$ to find the sum of the areas of the squares.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $BE^2$\n$BE^2 = 9^2 = 81$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{81}$"
