    "problem": "In order to compute the area of a particular circle, Juan first measures the length of its diameter. The actual diameter is 20 cm, but Juan's measurement has an error of up to $20\\%$. What is the largest possible percent error, in percent, in Juan's computed area of the circle?",
    "solution": "Juan can measure the diameter as a length anywhere between $20 - 20\\cdot 0.2 = 16$ and $20 + 20\\cdot 0.2 = 24$  cm. The actual area of the circle is $\\pi (20/2)^2=100\\pi$ square cm, but Juan can compute the area anywhere in the range $\\pi (16/2)^2=64 \\pi$ square cm to $\\pi (24/2)^2=144 \\pi$ square cm. Using the lower bound of the range, Juan's error is $(100\\pi - 64\\pi)/(100\\pi)=36\\%$. Using the upper bound of the range, Juan's error is $(144\\pi - 100\\pi)/(100\\pi)=44\\%$. Thus, the largest possible percent error is $\\boxed{44}$ percent.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the true area of the circle.\nThe formula to calculate the area of a circle is $A = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius. Given that the diameter is 20 cm, the radius is 10 cm. So, the true area is $A = \\pi (10)^2 = 100\\pi$ square cm.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the largest possible value of Juan's measurement.\nJuan's measurement has an error of up to $20\\%$. The largest possible measurement is $20 + 0.20 \\times 20 = 20 + 4 = 24$ cm.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area based on Juan's largest possible measurement.\nThe radius based on Juan's largest measurement is $24 / 2 = 12$ cm. The area calculated from this measurement is $A = \\pi (12)^2 = 144\\pi$ square cm.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the percent error in Juan's computation.\nThe percent error is calculated using the formula $\\frac{|True\\ value - Measured\\ value|}{True\\ value} \\times 100$. Substituting the values, we get $\\frac{|100\\pi - 144\\pi|}{100\\pi} \\times 100 = \\frac{44\\pi}{100\\pi} \\times 100 = 44$ percent.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{44}$"
