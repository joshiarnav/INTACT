    "solution": "Since more than half the employees are Administrative Specialists, the median salary will be an administrative specialist, thus, $\\boxed{\\$23{,}000}$.",

    "file_name": "./MATH_subsample_uniform/prealgebra/1896.json",
    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of employees\nTo find the median salary, we first need to determine the total number of employees. According to the table, the total number of employees is 1 (President) + 5 (Vice-President) + 10 (Director) + 6 (Associate Director) + 37 (Administrative Specialist) = 59.\n\n## Step 2: Arrange the salaries in ascending order\nWe need to arrange the salaries in ascending order to find the median. The salaries in ascending order are: $\\$23{,}000$ (37 times), $\\$50{,}000$ (6 times), $\\$75{,}000$ (10 times), $\\$90{,}000$ (5 times), and $\\$130{,}000$ (1 time).\n\n## Step 3: Find the middle value\nSince there are 59 employees (an odd number), the middle value is the 30th salary. This is because the median is the middle value in a dataset when it is ordered from smallest to largest. If we count the salaries from lowest to highest, the first 37 salaries are $\\$23{,}000$, so the 30th salary will be within this group.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the median salary\nSince the 30th salary falls within the group of 37 Administrative Specialists who all have the same salary of $\\$23{,}000$, the median salary is $\\$23{,}000$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{23000}$"
