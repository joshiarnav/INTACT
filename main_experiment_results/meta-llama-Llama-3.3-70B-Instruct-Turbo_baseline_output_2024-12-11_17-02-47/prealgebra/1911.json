    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the possible side lengths of the equilateral triangles\nTo find the number of equilateral triangles with all three vertices in the lattice, we first need to identify the possible side lengths of these triangles. The distance between nearest neighbors is given as 1 unit.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the possible equilateral triangles with a side length of 1 unit\nWe can start by identifying the equilateral triangles with a side length of 1 unit. These are the smallest possible equilateral triangles that can be formed using the lattice points.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the possible equilateral triangles with a side length of $\\sqrt{3}$ units\nNext, we need to consider the possibility of forming equilateral triangles with a side length of $\\sqrt{3}$ units. This is the distance between points that are two units apart in the lattice.\n\n## Step 4: Count the number of equilateral triangles with a side length of 1 unit\nBy examining the lattice, we can see that there are six equilateral triangles with a side length of 1 unit. These triangles are formed by the points that are nearest neighbors to each other.\n\n## Step 5: Count the number of equilateral triangles with a side length of $\\sqrt{3}$ units\nUpon closer inspection, we find that there are two equilateral triangles with a side length of $\\sqrt{3}$ units. These triangles are formed by the points that are two units apart in the lattice.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of equilateral triangles\nTo get the total number of equilateral triangles, we simply add the number of triangles with a side length of 1 unit and the number of triangles with a side length of $\\sqrt{3}$ units.\n\n## Step 7: Add the number of equilateral triangles with a side length of 1 unit and $\\sqrt{3}$ units\nTotal number of equilateral triangles = Number of triangles with a side length of 1 unit + Number of triangles with a side length of $\\sqrt{3}$ units = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
