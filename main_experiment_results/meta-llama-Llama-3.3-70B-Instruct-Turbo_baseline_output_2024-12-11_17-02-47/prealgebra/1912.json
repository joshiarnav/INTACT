    "solution": "Since the arithmetic mean of these expressions is 24, we can write the expression for the mean: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{(x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)}{5}&=24\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad (x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)&=5\\cdot 24\n\\end{align*}\n\nCombining like terms on the left, we find $5x+40=120$, so $5x=80$, from which we have $x=16$. Our final answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",

To find the arithmetic mean, we sum all the expressions and then divide by the number of expressions.\nThe arithmetic mean = (x + 8 + 15 + 2x + 13 + 2x + 4) / 5 = 24.\n\n## Step 2: Now we can write the equation based on the given information and solve for x.\n(x + 8 + 15 + 2x + 13 + 2x + 4) / 5 = 24.\n\n## Step 3: Combine like terms in the equation.\n(5x + 40) / 5 = 24.\n\n## Step 4: Multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to eliminate the denominator.\n5x + 40 = 120.\n\n## Step 5: Subtract 40 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x.\n5x = 80.\n\n## Step 6: Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to solve for x.\nx = 16.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$"
