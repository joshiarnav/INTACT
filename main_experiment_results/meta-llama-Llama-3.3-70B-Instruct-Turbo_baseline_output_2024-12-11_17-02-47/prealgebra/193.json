    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the range of numbers\nWe need to examine the numbers between 30 and 50 to determine which are prime.\n\n## Step 2: List the numbers in the range\nThe numbers between 30 and 50 are 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49.\n\n## Step 3: Define what a prime number is\nA prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the definition to each number in the range\n- 31 is prime because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n- 32 is not prime because it is divisible by 2.\n- 33 is not prime because it is divisible by 3.\n- 34 is not prime because it is divisible by 2.\n- 35 is not prime because it is divisible by 5 and 7.\n- 36 is not prime because it is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.\n- 37 is prime because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n- 38 is not prime because it is divisible by 2.\n- 39 is not prime because it is divisible by 3 and 13.\n- 40 is not prime because it is divisible by 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20.\n- 41 is prime because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n- 42 is not prime because it is divisible by 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21.\n- 43 is prime because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n- 44 is not prime because it is divisible by 2, 4, 11, 22.\n- 45 is not prime because it is divisible by 3, 5, 9, 15.\n- 46 is not prime because it is divisible by 2 and 23.\n- 47 is prime because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n- 48 is not prime because it is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24.\n- 49 is not prime because it is divisible by 7.\n\n## Step 5: Count the prime numbers identified\nFrom the analysis, the prime numbers between 30 and 50 are 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47. There are 5 prime numbers in total.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
