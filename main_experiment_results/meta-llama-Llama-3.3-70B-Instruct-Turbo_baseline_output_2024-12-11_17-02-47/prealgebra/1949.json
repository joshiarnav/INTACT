    "solution": "A number 10 less than an even perfect square cannot be prime, so let's check odd perfect squares greater than 10:\n\n$\\bullet$ $5^2=25,$ $25-10=15,$ composite.\n\n$\\bullet$ $7^2=49,$ $49-10=39,$ composite.\n\n$\\bullet$ $9^2=81,$ $81-10=71.$\n\nChecking prime numbers up to $7$ $($the  largest prime less than $\\sqrt{71})$ as potential divisors, we  see that $71$ is prime. Thus, the smallest prime that is $10$ less  than a perfect square is $\\boxed{71}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand what the problem is asking for\nWe need to find the smallest positive number that is both prime and $10$ less than a perfect square.\n\n## Step 2: Set up the equation for a number that is $10$ less than a perfect square\nLet's denote the number as $n$. According to the problem, $n = x^2 - 10$, where $x$ is an integer.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the properties of prime numbers\nA prime number is a natural number greater than $1$ that has no positive divisors other than $1$ and itself. We need to check each $n$ for primality.\n\n## Step 4: Start checking from the smallest possible perfect square\nThe smallest perfect square is $1^2 = 1$, but $1^2 - 10$ is negative, so we start with $x = 4$ because $3^2 - 10 = 9 - 10 = -1$, which is also negative.\n\n## Step 5: Check $x = 4$\nFor $x = 4$, $n = 4^2 - 10 = 16 - 10 = 6$. However, $6$ is not a prime number.\n\n## Step 6: Check $x = 5$\nFor $x = 5$, $n = 5^2 - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15$. $15$ is not a prime number.\n\n## Step 7: Check $x = 6$\nFor $x = 6$, $n = 6^2 - 10 = 36 - 10 = 26$. $26$ is not a prime number.\n\n## Step 8: Check $x = 7$\nFor $x = 7$, $n = 7^2 - 10 = 49 - 10 = 39$. $39$ is not a prime number.\n\n## Step 9: Check $x = 8$\nFor $x = 8$, $n = 8^2 - 10 = 64 - 10 = 54$. $54$ is not a prime number.\n\n## Step 10: Check $x = 9$\nFor $x = 9$, $n = 9^2 - 10 = 81 - 10 = 71$. $71$ is a prime number.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{71}$"
