    "problem": "If $x^2 = y - 3$ and $x = -5$, then what is the value of $y$?",
    "solution": "Substituting $-5$ for $x$ in the first equation, we have $(-5)^2 = y-3$.  So $25=y-3$. Adding $3$ to both sides, $y=\\boxed{28}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Substitute the value of x into the equation $x^2 = y - 3$\nWe are given $x = -5$. By substituting this value into the equation, we get $(-5)^2 = y - 3$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate $(-5)^2$\n$(-5)^2 = 25$, so the equation becomes $25 = y - 3$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for y\nTo solve for y, we add 3 to both sides of the equation: $25 + 3 = y$. This simplifies to $28 = y$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28}$"
