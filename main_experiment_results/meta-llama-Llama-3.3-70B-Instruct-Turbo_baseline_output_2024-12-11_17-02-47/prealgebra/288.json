    "problem": "What is the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime?",
    "solution": "The two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7; the largest two-digit prime is 97 (98 and 99 are both composite).  The product of these three primes is $5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 97 = 35 \\cdot 97 = 35(100-3)=3500-105=\\boxed{3395}$.",

The two-digit primes include 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the largest two-digit prime\nThe largest two-digit prime is 97.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime\nTo find the product, we multiply the two largest one-digit primes (5 and 7) by the largest two-digit prime (97). The calculation is 5 * 7 * 97.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the multiplication\n5 * 7 = 35, then 35 * 97 = 3395.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3395}$"
