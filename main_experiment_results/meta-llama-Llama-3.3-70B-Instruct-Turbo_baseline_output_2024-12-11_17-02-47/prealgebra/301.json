    "problem": "What is the greatest common factor of 68 and 92?",
    "solution": "$68=2^2\\cdot17$ and $92=2^2\\cdot23$. The only prime number that these two prime factorizations have in common is the number 2. If a number's prime factorization has a 2 raised to a power greater than 2, it will not be a factor of either of these numbers, so their GCF is $2^2=\\boxed{4}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: List the factors of each number\nTo find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 68 and 92, we first need to list all the factors of each number. The factors of 68 are 1, 2, 4, 17, 34, and 68. The factors of 92 are 1, 2, 4, 23, 46, and 92.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the common factors\nNext, we identify the factors that are common to both numbers. From the listed factors, we can see that the common factors of 68 and 92 are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the greatest common factor\nThe greatest common factor is the largest of the common factors identified. Among 1, 2, and 4, the largest is 4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
