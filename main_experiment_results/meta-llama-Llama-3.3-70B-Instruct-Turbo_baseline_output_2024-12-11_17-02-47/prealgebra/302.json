    "problem": "What is $ 6 \\div 3 - 2 - 8 + 2 \\cdot 8$?",
    "solution": "Recall that multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction. We get \\[\n6 \\div 3 - 2 - 8 + 2 \\cdot 8 = 2 - 2 - 8 + 16.\n\\]We rewrite the subtractions as additions of negations so we can rearrange:  \\begin{align*}\n2 - 2 - 8 + 16 &= 2 + (-2) + (-8) + 16 \\\\\n&= 16 + 2 + (-2) + (-8) \\\\\n&= 18 - (2+8) \\\\\n&= 18-10 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{8}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\nWe start with the given expression: $6 \\div 3 - 2 - 8 + 2 \\cdot 8$. There are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to multiplication and division.\n\n## Step 2: Perform the multiplication and division operations from left to right.\nFirst, we do the division: $6 \\div 3 = 2$. Then, we do the multiplication: $2 \\cdot 8 = 16$. So, the expression now becomes $2 - 2 - 8 + 16$.\n\n## Step 3: Next, we perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.\nWe start from the left: $2 - 2 = 0$. Then, $0 - 8 = -8$. Finally, $-8 + 16 = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
