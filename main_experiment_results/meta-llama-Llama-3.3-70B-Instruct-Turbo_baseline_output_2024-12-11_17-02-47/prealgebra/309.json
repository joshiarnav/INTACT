    "problem": "In a history class, the probability of earning an A is .7 times the probability of earning a B, and the probability of earning a C is 1.4 times the probability of earning a B. Assuming that all grades are A, B, or C, how many B's will there be in a history class of 31 students?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of students who earn a B. Then we know that the number of students who get an A is $.7x$ and the number of students who earn a C is $1.4x$. Since every student in the class gets an A, B, or C and there are 31 students, this gives us the equation $.7x + x + 1.4x = 31 \\Rightarrow 3.1x = 31 \\Rightarrow x =\\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the probabilities of earning grades A, B, and C.\nLet's denote the probability of earning grade A as P(A), grade B as P(B), and grade C as P(C). According to the problem, P(A) = 0.7 * P(B) and P(C) = 1.4 * P(B).\n\n## Step 2: Establish the relationship between the probabilities of all grades.\nSince all grades are A, B, or C, the sum of their probabilities must equal 1. Therefore, P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the expressions for P(A) and P(C) from Step 1 into the equation from Step 2.\nSubstituting P(A) = 0.7 * P(B) and P(C) = 1.4 * P(B) into P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1 gives 0.7 * P(B) + P(B) + 1.4 * P(B) = 1.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for P(B).\nCombining like terms in the equation 0.7 * P(B) + P(B) + 1.4 * P(B) = 1 results in 3.1 * P(B) = 1. Solving for P(B) gives P(B) = 1 / 3.1.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate P(B) as a decimal.\nP(B) = 1 / 3.1 \u2248 0.3226.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the expected number of B's in a class of 31 students.\nThe expected number of B's can be found by multiplying the total number of students by the probability of earning a B. So, the number of B's = P(B) * total number of students = 0.3226 * 31.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the expected number of B's.\nExpected number of B's \u2248 0.3226 * 31 \u2248 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
