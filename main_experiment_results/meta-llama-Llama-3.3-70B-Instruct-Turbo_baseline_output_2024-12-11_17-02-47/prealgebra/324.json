    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total percentage of sales for pens and pencils.\nThe total percentage of sales for pens and pencils is 38 + 35 = 73%.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the percentage of sales that were not pens or pencils.\nSince the total percentage of sales must equal 100%, the percentage of sales that were not pens or pencils can be found by subtracting the total percentage of pens and pencils from 100%. So, 100% - 73% = 27%.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$"
