    "solution": "The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so we must have \\[\\angle M + \\angle A + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle S = 540^\\circ.\\] Since $\\angle A$ and $\\angle S$ are supplementary, we have $\\angle A +\\angle S = 180^\\circ$.  Combining this with $\\angle H = \\angle M = \\angle T$, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\angle M + \\angle A + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle S& =\n(\\angle M + \\angle T + \\angle H) \\\\\n&\\qquad+ (\\angle A +\\angle S) \\\\\n&= 3\\angle H + 180^\\circ,\\end{align*} so $3\\angle H + 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ$.  Therefore, $3\\angle H = 360^\\circ$ and $\\angle H = \\boxed{120^\\circ}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the sum of interior angles in a pentagon\nThe sum of interior angles in a pentagon is given by the formula $180(n-2)$, where $n$ is the number of sides. For a pentagon, $n = 5$, so the sum of interior angles is $180(5-2) = 180(3) = 540$ degrees.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the given angle relationships\nWe are given that $\\angle M \\cong \\angle T \\cong \\angle H$, meaning these three angles are congruent and have the same measure. Let's denote the measure of these angles as $x$ degrees. We are also given that $\\angle A$ is supplementary to $\\angle S$, meaning the sum of $\\angle A$ and $\\angle S$ is $180$ degrees.\n\n## Step 3: Express the sum of the interior angles using the given relationships\nLet the measure of $\\angle A$ be $y$ degrees and the measure of $\\angle S$ be $180 - y$ degrees, since they are supplementary. The sum of all interior angles in the pentagon can be expressed as $x + y + x + (180 - y) + x = 540$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation from Step 3: $x + y + x + 180 - y + x = 540$. The $y$ and $-y$ cancel out, resulting in $3x + 180 = 540$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $x$\nSubtract 180 from both sides of the equation: $3x = 540 - 180$, which simplifies to $3x = 360$. Then divide both sides by 3 to solve for $x$: $x = 360 / 3 = 120$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{120}$"
