    "problem": "What is the number of square meters in the area of a circle with diameter 4 meters? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "A circle's radius is half its diameter, so if the diameter of a circle is 4 meters, then its radius is 2 meters.  The area of the circle is $\\pi(\\text{radius})^2=\\pi(2\\text{ m})^2=\\boxed{4\\pi}$ square meters.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the formula for the area of a circle\nThe area of a circle can be calculated using the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the radius of the circle\nGiven that the diameter of the circle is 4 meters, the radius $r$ is half of the diameter, so $r = 4 / 2 = 2$ meters.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area of the circle\nSubstitute the value of the radius into the area formula: $A = \\pi (2)^2 = \\pi \\times 4 = 4\\pi$ square meters.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4\\pi}$"
