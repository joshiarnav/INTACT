    "problem": "Round to the nearest hundredth: 18.4851",
    "solution": "To round $18.4851$ to the nearest hundredth, we must look at the hundreds and the thousands digits of the number in question. Since the thousands digit ($5$) is greater than or equal to $5$, the hundreds digit $8$ rounds up to $9$. Therefore, $18.4851$ rounded to the nearest hundredth is equal to $\\boxed{18.49}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: We need to round the given number, 18.4851, to the nearest hundredth.\nTo round to the nearest hundredth, we look at the thousandths place, which is the third digit after the decimal point.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the digit in the hundredths place and the digit in the thousandths place.\nThe digit in the hundredths place is 8 and the digit in the thousandths place is 5.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the rounding rule.\nIf the digit in the thousandths place is 5 or greater, we round up the digit in the hundredths place. If it is less than 5, we leave the digit in the hundredths place unchanged.\n\n## Step 4: Round the number.\nSince the digit in the thousandths place is 5, we round up the digit in the hundredths place. So, 18.4851 rounded to the nearest hundredth is 18.49.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18.49}$"
