    "problem": "The circular region of the sign (below, left) has an area of 154 square inches. Vanessa would like to place a tiny ribbon (shaded) around the circle's edge. To be sure she has enough ribbon, she decides to buy 2 inches more of the ribbon than the original circle's circumference. How many inches of ribbon will Vanessa need to buy if she estimates $\\pi = \\frac{22}{7}$?\n\n[asy]import graph;\nsize(125,72.5);\npicture p;\ndraw(p,unitsquare);\nfilldraw(p,Circle((.5,.5),.3),white);\nlabel(p,\"Enter\",(.5,.5),ZapfChancery(\"m\",\"n\"));\nadd(p);\nfilldraw(Circle((2,.5),.4),gray(.6));\nadd(shift(1.5*right)*p);\ndraw((1.1,.5)--(1.4,.5),EndArrow(5,25));[/asy]",
    "solution": "Say the radius of the circle is $r$. Then the area of the circle is $\\pi r^2,$ which we estimate to $154=\\frac{22}{7}r^2$. If we multiply both sides by $\\frac{7}{22}$, we get $r^2=49$ or $r=7$. The circle's circumference is $2\\pi r$, which we again estimate to $\\frac{44}{7}r=44$. Vanessa wants two extra inches of ribbon, so she needs to buy $44+2=\\boxed{46}$ inches of ribbon.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, we need to find the radius of the circular region of the sign.\nLet's denote the radius of the circular region as $r$. The area of the circular region is given as 154 square inches. We can use the formula for the area of a circle, $A = \\pi r^2$, to find the radius.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the given area and the estimated value of $\\pi$ into the formula to solve for $r$.\nWe have $154 = \\frac{22}{7}r^2$. Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{7}{22}$ gives $r^2 = 49$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $r = 7$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the circumference of the circle using the estimated value of $\\pi$.\nThe circumference $C$ of a circle is given by $C = 2\\pi r$. Substituting the estimated value of $\\pi$ and the radius $r$, we get $C = 2 \\times \\frac{22}{7} \\times 7 = 44$ inches.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the length of the ribbon Vanessa needs to buy.\nVanessa wants to buy 2 inches more than the original circle's circumference. So, the length of the ribbon she needs to buy is $44 + 2 = 46$ inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{46}$"
