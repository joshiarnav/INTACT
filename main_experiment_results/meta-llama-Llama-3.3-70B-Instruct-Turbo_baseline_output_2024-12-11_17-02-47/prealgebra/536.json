    "problem": "A zoo has a menagerie containing four pairs of different animals, one male and one female for each. The zookeeper wishes to feed the animals in a specific pattern: each time he feeds a single animal, the next one he feeds must be a different gender. If he starts by feeding the male giraffe, how many ways can he feed all the animals?",
    "solution": "If the zookeeper starts with the male giraffe, there are 4 females which he can feed next. Once one is selected, there are 3 males he can feed next, then 3 females, 2 males, 2 females, 1 male, and 1 female.\n\nThe total number of possibilities is $4\\times3\\times3\\times2\\times2 = \\boxed{144}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of animals and their genders.\nThere are four pairs of different animals, meaning there are 4 males and 4 females, totaling 8 animals.\n\n## Step 2: Establish the feeding pattern rule.\nThe zookeeper must alternate the gender of the animal each time he feeds one. Since he starts with a male, the pattern will be male-female-male-female and so on.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of choices at each step of the feeding pattern.\n1. For the first feeding, the choice is already made (the male giraffe), so there is 1 way to start.\n2. For the second feeding, since it must be a female and there are 4 females, there are 4 choices.\n3. For the third feeding, it must be a male, and since one male (the giraffe) has already been fed, there are 3 remaining males to choose from.\n4. For the fourth feeding, it must be a female, and since one female has been fed, there are 3 remaining females.\n5. For the fifth feeding, it must be a male, with 2 males remaining.\n6. For the sixth feeding, it must be a female, with 2 females remaining.\n7. For the seventh feeding, it must be a male, with 1 male remaining.\n8. For the eighth feeding, it must be the last female, so there's only 1 choice.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways to feed the animals based on the choices at each step.\nThe total number of ways = 1 (for the first male) * 4 (females to choose from) * 3 (males remaining) * 3 (females remaining) * 2 (males remaining) * 2 (females remaining) * 1 (male remaining) * 1 (female remaining).\n\n## Step 5: Perform the multiplication.\nTotal ways = 1 * 4 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 144.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{144}$"
