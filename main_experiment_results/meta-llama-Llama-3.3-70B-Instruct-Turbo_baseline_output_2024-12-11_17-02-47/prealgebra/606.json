    "problem": "An equilateral triangle has sides of length 2 units. A second equilateral triangle is formed having sides that are $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the first triangle. A third equilateral triangle is formed having sides that are $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the second triangle. The process is continued until four equilateral triangles exist. What will be the percent increase in the perimeter from the first triangle to the fourth triangle? Express your answer to the nearest tenth.",
    "solution": "If the side length of each successive equilateral triangle is $150\\%$ of the previous triangle, then we can multiply the previous side length by 1.5. We will need to do this three times to get to the fourth triangle, so its side length will be $$1.5^3 = 1.5 \\times 1.5 \\times 1.5 = 3.375$$ times the  original side length. This is the same as $337.5\\%$ of the original side length, which represents a $337.5 - 100 = 237.5\\%$ increase over the original side length. The perimeter is also a length, so it will be affected in the same way. The percent increase in the perimeter is $\\boxed{237.5\\%}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the original perimeter of the first equilateral triangle.\nThe original perimeter is calculated by multiplying the length of the side of the equilateral triangle by 3 since all sides are equal. Thus, the original perimeter is $2 \\times 3 = 6$ units.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the side length of the second equilateral triangle.\nThe second triangle's side length is $150\\%$ of the first triangle's side length. This can be calculated as $2 \\times 1.5 = 3$ units.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the side length of the third equilateral triangle.\nThe third triangle's side length is $150\\%$ of the second triangle's side length. This can be calculated as $3 \\times 1.5 = 4.5$ units.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the side length of the fourth equilateral triangle.\nThe fourth triangle's side length is $150\\%$ of the third triangle's side length. This can be calculated as $4.5 \\times 1.5 = 6.75$ units.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the perimeter of the fourth equilateral triangle.\nThe perimeter of the fourth triangle is $6.75 \\times 3 = 20.25$ units.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the percent increase in the perimeter from the first triangle to the fourth triangle.\nThe percent increase is calculated using the formula $\\left( \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\right) \\times 100$. Thus, the percent increase is $\\left( \\frac{20.25 - 6}{6} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{14.25}{6} \\right) \\times 100 = 2.375 \\times 100 = 237.5\\%$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{237.5}$"
