    "problem": "If $\\frac{5}{33}$ is expressed in decimal form, what digit is in the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point?",
    "solution": "When we write $\\frac{5}{33}$ as a decimal using long division, we get $0.\\overline{15}=0.15151515\\ldots$. Notice the pattern we have here: if $n$ is odd, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal point is $1$; if $n$ is even, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal place is $5$. Since $92$ is an even number, the digit at the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point is $\\boxed{5}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, let's convert the fraction $\\frac{5}{33}$ to decimal form.\nTo do this, we divide the numerator by the denominator: $5 \\div 33 = 0.151515...$.\n\n## Step 2: We notice that the decimal form of $\\frac{5}{33}$ is a repeating decimal, with the sequence \"15\" repeating indefinitely.\nThis means that every two digits, the sequence repeats.\n\n## Step 3: Since the sequence \"15\" is two digits long, we can find the location of the 92nd digit by finding the remainder when 92 is divided by 2.\n92 divided by 2 is 46 with a remainder of 0.\n\n## Step 4: Because there is no remainder, the 92nd digit will be the last digit in the repeating sequence \"15\".\nThe last digit in the sequence \"15\" is 5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
