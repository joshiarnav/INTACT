    "problem": "How many diagonals does a convex polygon with 23 sides have?",
    "solution": "If the polygon has 23 sides, then it has 23 vertices. A diagonal is created by choosing 2 non-adjacent vertices and connecting them. First we choose a vertex. There are 23 choices. Then we choose another vertex that is not adjacent to the one we already chose. There are 20 choices for this. However, we have double counted all the diagonals, so the number of diagonals is $\\frac{23 \\cdot 20}{2}=23 \\cdot 10=\\boxed{230} \\text{ diagonals}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the formula for calculating the number of diagonals in a convex polygon.\nThe formula to calculate the number of diagonals in a convex polygon is given by $n(n-3)/2$, where $n$ is the number of sides of the polygon.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the value of $n$ into the formula to find the number of diagonals.\nGiven that the polygon has 23 sides, we substitute $n = 23$ into the formula: $23(23-3)/2$.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the arithmetic to calculate the result.\nCalculate $23-3$ first, which equals $20$. Then, multiply $23$ by $20$ to get $460$. Finally, divide $460$ by $2$ to get the total number of diagonals.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final result of the division.\n$460 / 2 = 230$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{230}$"
