    "problem": "A square 10cm on each side has four quarter circles drawn with centers at the four corners. How many square centimeters are in the area of the shaded region? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize (1.5 cm);\n\ndraw((-1,-1)--(1,-1)--(1,1)--(-1,1)--cycle);\nfilldraw(arc((1,1),1,270,180)--arc((-1,1),1,360,270)--arc((-1,-1),1,90,0)--arc((1,-1),1,180,90)--cycle,gray);\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "We first notice that the area of the shaded region is the area of the square minus the areas of the four quarter circles. Each quarter circle has a radius half the side length, so if we sum the areas of the four quarter circles, we have the area of one full circle with radius $5$ cm. Now, we know the area of a square is the square of its side length, so the square has an area of $100 \\text{ cm}^2$. A circle has an area of $\\pi$ times its radius squared, so the four quarter circles combined have an area of $\\pi(5)^2=25\\pi \\text{ cm}^2$. From this, we know that the area of the shaded region is $\\boxed{100-25\\pi} \\text{ cm}^2$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the area of the square\nThe area of the square can be calculated by multiplying the length of its side by itself. Since each side of the square is 10cm, the area of the square is $10 \\times 10 = 100$ square centimeters.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the area of the four quarter circles\nThe four quarter circles together form a complete circle with a radius of 5cm (half the length of the side of the square). The area of a circle can be calculated using the formula $\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. So, the area of the four quarter circles is $\\pi \\times 5^2 = 25\\pi$ square centimeters.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area of the shaded region\nThe area of the shaded region can be calculated by subtracting the area of the four quarter circles from the area of the square. So, the area of the shaded region is $100 - 25\\pi = 100 - 25\\pi$ square centimeters.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{100 - 25\\pi}$"
