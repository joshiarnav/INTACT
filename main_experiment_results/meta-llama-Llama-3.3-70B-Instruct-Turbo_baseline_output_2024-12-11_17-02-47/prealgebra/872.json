    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 3 and 6\nTo find the GCF, we list the factors of each number. The factors of 3 are 1 and 3. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The greatest factor they have in common is 3.\n\n## Step 2: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 6\nTo find the LCM, we list the multiples of each number. The multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. The multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, etc. The smallest multiple they have in common is 6.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the sum of the GCF and LCM\nNow, we add the GCF and LCM together. GCF + LCM = 3 + 6 = 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$"
