    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the area of triangle ABC, we first need to identify key properties of the triangle.\nGiven the 30-degree angle and the altitude CD, we recognize that triangle ACD is a 30-60-90 triangle because CD is the altitude and also the side opposite the 30-degree angle.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the length of the sides of triangle ACD.\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides is 1:sqrt(3):2. Given that CD (the side opposite the 30-degree angle) is sqrt(3) centimeters, this aligns with the ratio 1:sqrt(3):2, meaning that AD (the side opposite the 60-degree angle) would be 2 times the length of CD, but since CD corresponds to the sqrt(3) part of the ratio, we deduce that AD = 2 and AC = 2 * 2 = 4, as AC is the hypotenuse of triangle ACD and thus twice the shortest side.\n\n## Step 3: Find the length of side BC to calculate the area of triangle ABC.\nGiven triangle ABC is also a 30-60-90 triangle (since angle A is 30 degrees and we've established AC = 4, which is twice the length of AD), we can apply the 1:sqrt(3):2 ratio again. Here, AC corresponds to the \"2\" part of the ratio, meaning BC (the side opposite the 30-degree angle in triangle ABC) is half of AC times sqrt(3), but since AC = 4 and corresponds to the \"2\" in the ratio, BC would simply be 2, as it's the side opposite the 30-degree and should be half of the hypotenuse's length times sqrt(3), but given our established lengths, it directly fits the 1:sqrt(3):2 ratio for triangle ABC with AC = 4.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of triangle ABC.\nThe area of a triangle can be found using the formula: Area = 0.5 * base * height. Here, BC can serve as the base, and AD (or the altitude from A to BC) can serve as the height. Given BC = 2 and AD = 2 (from step 2, recognizing the triangle types and their side ratios), the area of triangle ABC = 0.5 * BC * AD.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{3}}$"
