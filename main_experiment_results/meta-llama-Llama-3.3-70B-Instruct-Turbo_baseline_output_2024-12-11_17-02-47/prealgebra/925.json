    "problem": "A number in the set $\\{50, 51, 52, 53, ... , 999\\}$ is randomly selected. What is the probability that it is a two-digit number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "To count the number of numbers in this set, we subtract 49 from all of the numbers, giving the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 950 \\}$, making it obvious that there are 950 numbers total. Furthermore, the set $\\{ 50, 51, 52, \\ldots, 98, 99 \\}$ corresponds to the more easily counted $\\{ 1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 49, 50 \\}$ by subtracting 49. So, the probability of selecting a two-digit number is $\\frac{50}{950} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the total set of numbers\nThe set of numbers is given as $\\{50, 51, 52, 53, ... , 999\\}$. To find the total count of numbers in this set, we subtract the starting number from the ending number and add 1. Since the numbers are consecutive and start from 50, the total count of numbers is $999 - 50 + 1 = 950$.\n\n## Step 2: Define the subset of two-digit numbers\nThe subset of two-digit numbers within the given set starts from 50 and ends at 99. To find the count of two-digit numbers, we subtract the starting number from the ending number and add 1. Thus, the count of two-digit numbers is $99 - 50 + 1 = 50$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of selecting a two-digit number\nThe probability of selecting a two-digit number is calculated by dividing the count of two-digit numbers by the total count of numbers in the set. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{50}{950}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the fraction\nTo simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 50 and 950. The GCD of 50 and 950 is 50. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 50, we get $\\frac{1}{19}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$"
