    "solution": "Since the point lies in the $xz$-plane, it is of the form $(x,0,z).$  We want this point to be equidistant to the points $(1,-1,0),$ $(2,1,2),$ and $(3,2,-1),$ which gives us the equations\n\\begin{align*}\n(x - 1)^2 + 1^2 + z^2 &= (x - 2)^2 + 1^2 + (z - 2)^2, \\\\\n(x - 1)^2 + 1^2 + z^2 &= (x - 3)^2 + 2^2 + (z + 1)^2.\n\\end{align*}These equations simplify to $2x + 4z = 7$ and $4x - 2z = 12.$  Solving these equation, we find $x = \\frac{31}{10}$ and $z = \\frac{1}{5},$ so the point we seek is $\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{31}{10}, 0, \\frac{1}{5} \\right)}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Let's denote the point in the $xz$-plane as $(x,0,z)$ since it has no $y$-component.\nWe are looking for a point $(x,0,z)$.\n\n## Step 2: The distance $d_1$ from $(x,0,z)$ to $(1,-1,0)$ can be found using the distance formula in 3D space.\n$d_1 = \\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (0 - (-1))^2 + (z - 0)^2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation for $d_1$.\n$d_1 = \\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + 1 + z^2}$.\n\n## Step 4: The distance $d_2$ from $(x,0,z)$ to $(2,1,2)$ can be found using the distance formula in 3D space.\n$d_2 = \\sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + (0 - 1)^2 + (z - 2)^2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the equation for $d_2$.\n$d_2 = \\sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + 1 + (z - 2)^2}$.\n\n## Step 6: The distance $d_3$ from $(x,0,z)$ to $(3,2,-1)$ can be found using the distance formula in 3D space.\n$d_3 = \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + (0 - 2)^2 + (z - (-1))^2}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the equation for $d_3$.\n$d_3 = \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + 4 + (z + 1)^2}$.\n\n## Step 8: Since the point $(x,0,z)$ is equidistant from the three given points, we can set $d_1 = d_2$ and $d_1 = d_3$.\nThis gives us two equations: $(x - 1)^2 + 1 + z^2 = (x - 2)^2 + 1 + (z - 2)^2$ and $(x - 1)^2 + 1 + z^2 = (x - 3)^2 + 4 + (z + 1)^2$.\n\n## Step 9: Expand and simplify the first equation $(x - 1)^2 + 1 + z^2 = (x - 2)^2 + 1 + (z - 2)^2$.\nThis yields $x^2 - 2x + 1 + 1 + z^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 + 1 + z^2 - 4z + 4$.\n\n## Step 10: Further simplify the first equation by canceling like terms and solving for $x$ or $z$.\nThis simplifies to $-2x + 2 = -4x + 9 - 4z$, which can be rearranged to $2x + 4z = 7$.\n\n## Step 11: Expand and simplify the second equation $(x - 1)^2 + 1 + z^2 = (x - 3)^2 + 4 + (z + 1)^2$.\nThis yields $x^2 - 2x + 1 + 1 + z^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9 + 4 + z^2 + 2z + 1$.\n\n## Step 12: Further simplify the second equation by canceling like terms and solving for $x$ or $z$.\nThis simplifies to $-2x + 2 = -6x + 14 + 2z$, which can be rearranged to $4x - 2z = 12$.\n\n## Step 13: Now we have a system of linear equations: $2x + 4z = 7$ and $4x - 2z = 12$.\nWe can solve this system for $x$ and $z$.\n\n## Step 14: Multiply the first equation by 2 to align it with the coefficients of the second equation for easier elimination.\nThis gives $4x + 8z = 14$.\n\n## Step 15: Subtract the second equation from the modified first equation to eliminate $x$.\n$(4x + 8z) - (4x - 2z) = 14 - 12$, which simplifies to $10z = 2$.\n\n## Step 16: Solve for $z$.\n$z = 2 / 10 = 1/5$.\n\n## Step 17: Substitute $z = 1/5$ back into one of the original equations to solve for $x$.\nUsing $2x + 4z = 7$, we get $2x + 4(1/5) = 7$.\n\n## Step 18: Solve for $x$.\n$2x + 4/5 = 7$, which simplifies to $2x = 7 - 4/5$.\n$2x = (35 - 4) / 5$.\n$2x = 31 / 5$.\n$x = 31 / 10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{31}{10}, \\  0, \\  \\frac{1}{5}\\right)}$"
