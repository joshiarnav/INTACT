    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the definition of the absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number.\nThe absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number $z = a + bi$, denoted as $|z|$, is defined as $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the given condition $|z| = 1$.\nGiven $|z| = 1$, this implies that $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 1$, which further implies $a^2 + b^2 = 1$. This is the equation of a unit circle centered at the origin in the complex plane.\n\n## Step 3: Express $z$ in polar form.\nAny complex number $z$ can be expressed in polar form as $z = re^{i\\theta}$, where $r$ is the modulus of $z$ and $\\theta$ is the argument of $z$. Since $|z| = 1$, $r = 1$, and thus $z = e^{i\\theta}$.\n\n## Step 4: Understand the expression $z^{6!}-z^{5!}$.\nSubstituting $z = e^{i\\theta}$ into the expression gives $e^{i\\theta \\cdot 6!} - e^{i\\theta \\cdot 5!}$. Simplifying, $6! = 720$ and $5! = 120$, so the expression becomes $e^{i720\\theta} - e^{i120\\theta}$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Euler's formula.\nEuler's formula states that $e^{ix} = \\cos(x) + i\\sin(x)$. Applying this to the expression yields $(\\cos(720\\theta) + i\\sin(720\\theta)) - (\\cos(120\\theta) + i\\sin(120\\theta))$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression to be in the form of a real number.\nFor the expression to be a real number, the imaginary parts must cancel out. This simplifies to $\\cos(720\\theta) - \\cos(120\\theta) + i(\\sin(720\\theta) - \\sin(120\\theta))$. For this to be real, $\\sin(720\\theta) - \\sin(120\\theta) = 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve the condition for the expression to be real.\nUsing sum-to-product identities, $\\sin(A) - \\sin(B) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{A+B}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{A-B}{2}\\right)$. Applying this, $2\\cos\\left(\\frac{720\\theta+120\\theta}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{720\\theta-120\\theta}{2}\\right) = 0$. Simplifying gives $2\\cos(420\\theta)\\sin(300\\theta) = 0$.\n\n## Step 8: Find conditions for $\\theta$ that satisfy the equation.\nEither $\\cos(420\\theta) = 0$ or $\\sin(300\\theta) = 0$. For $\\cos(420\\theta) = 0$, $420\\theta = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2}$, and for $\\sin(300\\theta) = 0$, $300\\theta = m\\pi$, where $n$ and $m$ are integers.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for $\\theta$ in both conditions.\nFor $\\cos(420\\theta) = 0$, $\\theta = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{840}$. For $\\sin(300\\theta) = 0$, $\\theta = \\frac{m\\pi}{300}$.\n\n## Step 10: Consider the range of $\\theta$.\nSince $\\theta$ represents the argument of a complex number, it can range from $0$ to $2\\pi$.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the number of solutions within the range.\nFor $\\theta = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{840}$, the values of $n$ that yield unique $\\theta$ in the range $0$ to $2\\pi$ need to be counted. Similarly, for $\\theta = \\frac{m\\pi}{300}$, count the unique values of $m$ in the same range.\n\n## Step 12: Determine the total number of unique solutions.\nThe total number of unique solutions is the sum of unique solutions from both conditions. Since the range of $\\theta$ is $0$ to $2\\pi$, and given the periodic nature of sine and cosine, the solutions will repeat after $2\\pi$. Thus, we need to ensure we count each distinct solution within this range.\n\n## Step 13: Account for overlapping solutions.\nSome solutions from both conditions might overlap (i.e., satisfy both equations). These need to be identified and counted only once.\n\n## Step 14: Calculate the final count of distinct complex numbers $z$.\nAfter identifying all unique $\\theta$ values that satisfy the condition within the specified range and accounting for any overlaps, calculate the total count of distinct complex numbers $z$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1440}$"
