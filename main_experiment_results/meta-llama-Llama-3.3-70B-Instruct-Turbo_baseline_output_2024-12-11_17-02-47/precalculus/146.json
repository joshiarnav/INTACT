    "solution": "The side length of the regular tetrahedron is the distance between $(0,1,2)$ and $(4,2,1),$ which is\n\\[\\sqrt{(0 - 4)^2 + (1 - 2)^2 + (2 - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{18} = 3 \\sqrt{2}.\\]So if $(x,y,z)$ is the fourth vertex, with integer coordinates, then\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 2)^2 &= 18, \\\\\n(x - 4)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + (z - 1)^2 &= 18, \\\\\n(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 5)^2 &= 18.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting the first and third equations, we get $6x + 6z - 30 = 0$, so $x + z = 5,$ which means $z = 5 - x.$  Subtracting the first and second equation, we get $8x + 2y - 2z - 16 = 0,$ so\n\\[y = z - 4x + 8 = (5 - x) - 4x + 8 = 13 - 5x.\\]Substituting into the first equation, we get\n\\[x^2 + (12 - 5x)^2 + (3 - x)^2 = 18.\\]This simplifies to $27x^2 - 126x + 135 = 0,$ which factors as $9(x - 3)(3x - 5) = 0.$  Since $x$ is an integer, $x = 3.$  Then $y = -2$ and $z = 2.$  Thus, the fourth vertex is $\\boxed{(3,-2,2)}.$",

This means that the distance between any two vertices is the same.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the distances between the given vertices\nTo find the length of the edges, we calculate the distances between the given vertices. Let's denote the vertices as $A(0,1,2),$ $B(4,2,1),$ and $C(3,1,5)$. The distance formula between two points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ in 3D space is $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 + (z_2-z_1)^2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the distance formula to find the length of the edges\n- Distance between $A$ and $B$: $\\sqrt{(4-0)^2 + (2-1)^2 + (1-2)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 1 + 1} = \\sqrt{18}$.\n- Distance between $B$ and $C$: $\\sqrt{(3-4)^2 + (1-2)^2 + (5-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1 + 16} = \\sqrt{18}$.\n- Distance between $A$ and $C$: $\\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (1-1)^2 + (5-2)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 0 + 9} = \\sqrt{18}$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the length of the edges of the tetrahedron\nSince all distances between the given vertices are equal, with a value of $\\sqrt{18}$, this confirms that the given points are vertices of a regular tetrahedron, and the length of each edge is $\\sqrt{18}$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the fourth vertex\nThe fourth vertex $D$ must be equidistant from $A$, $B$, and $C$, with the distance being $\\sqrt{18}$. This means that $D$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of the line segments $AB$, $BC$, and $AC$. However, since we're looking for integer coordinates and given the symmetry and properties of a tetrahedron, we can use the fact that the centroid of the triangle $ABC$ (which is also the centroid of the tetrahedron) can help us find the fourth vertex.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the centroid of triangle $ABC$\nThe centroid $G$ of a triangle with vertices $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$, $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3, z_3)$ is given by $\\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3}{3}, \\frac{y_1+y_2+y_3}{3}, \\frac{z_1+z_2+z_3}{3}\\right)$. For $A$, $B$, and $C$, the centroid $G$ is $\\left(\\frac{0+4+3}{3}, \\frac{1+2+1}{3}, \\frac{2+1+5}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{7}{3}, \\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{8}{3}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 7: Use the centroid to find the fourth vertex\nThe fourth vertex $D$ of the tetrahedron is symmetric to the centroid $G$ of the triangle $ABC$ with respect to the centroid of the tetrahedron. Since the tetrahedron's centroid divides the median into a 3:1 ratio, where the longer segment is towards the vertex, and given that $G$ is also the centroid of the tetrahedron, the fourth vertex must be at a position that maintains this symmetry and has integer coordinates.\n\n## Step 8: Apply symmetry and integer constraint to find the fourth vertex\nGiven the symmetry and the need for integer coordinates, and knowing that the distance from $D$ to $A$, $B$, and $C$ must be $\\sqrt{18}$, we look for a point that satisfies these conditions and is symmetrically positioned with respect to the centroid of the triangle $ABC$. The centroid of the tetrahedron, which coincides with $G$, helps in finding a point that is symmetric and satisfies the distance condition.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the position of the fourth vertex\nGiven the constraints and the need for integer coordinates, let's consider the vector from $G$ to each of the vertices and use the fact that the fourth vertex must be equidistant from $A$, $B$, and $C$. This involves solving equations based on the distance formula and the symmetry of the tetrahedron.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(3, 3, 0)}$"
