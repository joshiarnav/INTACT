    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given function\nThe function given is $y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x}$. This function will have $x$-intercepts wherever $\\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0$, which means $\\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi$ for any nonzero integer $n$, since the sine of any integer multiple of $\\pi$ radians is zero.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the range of $n$\nTo find the $x$-intercepts within the interval $(0.0001, 0.001)$, we need to determine the range of $n$ that satisfies $\\frac{1}{n\\pi}$ being within this interval. This means we are looking for $n$ such that $0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the inequalities for $n$\nFirst, solve the left inequality: $0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi}$. This gives $n\\pi < \\frac{1}{0.0001}$, which simplifies to $n < \\frac{1}{0.0001\\pi} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.00031416} \\approx 3183$.\n\nNext, solve the right inequality: $\\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001$. This gives $n\\pi > \\frac{1}{0.001}$, which simplifies to $n > \\frac{1}{0.001\\pi} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.0031416} \\approx 318$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of $x$-intercepts\nSince $n$ must be an integer, and from Step 3 we know $318 < n < 3183$, the number of $x$-intercepts within the given interval is the number of integers between 319 and 3183, inclusive.\n\n## Step 5: Find the number of integers in the range\nThe number of integers from 319 to 3183, inclusive, is $3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2865}$"
