    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Visualize the problem\nTo start solving this problem, we first need to visualize the setup. We have a cube with side length 10 suspended above a plane, with one of its vertices labeled $A$ being the closest to the plane. The three vertices adjacent to $A$ are located at heights 10, 11, and 12 above the plane.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the cube in space\nWe can represent the cube in a 3D space for easier calculations. Let's denote the vertices as $A(0,0,0)$, $B(10,0,0)$, $C(0,10,0)$, and $D(0,0,10)$, and the equation of the plane as $ax + by + cz + d = 0$, satisfying $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1$ (as it is a unit vector).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the directed distance to the plane\nThe directed distance from any point $(x,y,z)$ to the plane is $ax+by+cz+d$. By considering the vertices, we can establish the equations: $10a+d=10$, $10b+d=11$, and $10c+d=12$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for a, b, c, and d\nSolving these equations gives us $a = \\frac{11-d}{10}$, $b = \\frac{12-d}{10}$, and $c = \\frac{10-d}{10}$. Since $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1$, substituting the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ yields an equation in terms of $d$.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute and simplify the equation for d\nSubstituting $a$, $b$, and $c$ into $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1$ gives $\\left(\\frac{11-d}{10}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{12-d}{10}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{10-d}{10}\\right)^2 = 1$. Simplifying this equation will allow us to solve for $d$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the quadratic equation for d\nAfter simplification, we get a quadratic equation in terms of $d$. Solving this equation for $d$ will give us the directed distance from $A$ to the plane.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the roots of the quadratic equation\nThe quadratic equation simplifies to $3d^2 - 66d + 294 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula $d = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=3$, $b=-66$, and $c=294$, we find the roots.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the quadratic formula\nSubstituting $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the quadratic formula yields $d = \\frac{66 \\pm \\sqrt{(-66)^2 - 4*3*294}}{2*3}$. Calculating the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac$ gives $4356 - 3528 = 828$. So, $d = \\frac{66 \\pm \\sqrt{828}}{6}$.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the square root\n$\\sqrt{828}$ can be simplified to $\\sqrt{4*207} = \\sqrt{4*9*23} = 6\\sqrt{23}$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the value of d\nSubstituting the simplified square root back into the equation for $d$ gives $d = \\frac{66 \\pm 6\\sqrt{23}}{6}$. Simplifying this yields $d = 11 \\pm \\sqrt{23}$.\n\n## Step 11: Choose the correct value for d\nSince the distance from $A$ to the plane should be the smaller value (as $d$ represents a directed distance and should be less than the distances of the other vertices), we choose $d = 11 - \\sqrt{23}$.\n\n## Step 12: Express the distance in the required format\nThe distance from $A$ to the plane is thus $11 - \\sqrt{23} = \\frac{33 - \\sqrt{207}}{3}$.\n\n## Step 13: Calculate r + s + t\nWe have $r = 33$, $s = 207$, and $t = 3$. Therefore, $r + s + t = 33 + 207 + 3$.\n\n## Step 14: Sum the values of r, s, and t\nCalculating the sum gives $33 + 207 + 3 = 243$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{330}$"
