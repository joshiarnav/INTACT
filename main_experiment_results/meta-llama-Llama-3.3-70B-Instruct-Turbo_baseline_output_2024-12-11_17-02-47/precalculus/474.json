    "problem": "What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that all the roots of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity?",
    "solution": "Multiplying the equation $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ by $z^2 + 1$, we get $z^6 + 1 = 0$.  Multiplying this equation by $z^6 - 1 = 0$, we get $z^{12} - 1 = 0$.  Therefore, every root of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ is a $12^{\\text{th}}$ root of unity.\n\nWe can factor $z^{12} - 1 = 0$ as\n\\[(z^6 - 1)(z^6 + 1) = (z^6 - 1)(z^2 + 1)(z^4 - z^2 + 1) = 0.\\]The $12^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity are $e^{0}$, $e^{2 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{4 \\pi i/12}$, $\\dots$, $e^{22 \\pi i/12}$.  We see that $e^{0}$, $e^{4 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{8 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{12 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{16 \\pi i/12}$, and $e^{20 \\pi i/12}$ are the roots of $z^6 - 1 = 0$.  Also, $e^{6 \\pi i/12} = e^{\\pi i/2} = i$ and $e^{18 \\pi i/12} = e^{3 \\pi i/2} = -i$ are the roots of $z^2 + 1 = 0$.  Thus, the roots of\n\\[z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0\\]are the remaining four $12^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity, namely $e^{2 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{10 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{14 \\pi i/12}$, and $e^{22 \\pi i/12}$.  The complex number $e^{2 \\pi i/12}$ is a primitive $12^{\\text{th}}$ root of unity, so by definition, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $(e^{2 \\pi i/12})^n = 1$ is 12.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recognize the equation as a quadratic in disguise\nThe given equation $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ can be viewed as a quadratic equation by letting $y = z^2$, thus transforming it into $y^2 - y + 1 = 0$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the quadratic equation for y\nUsing the quadratic formula $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = 1$, we get $y = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{-3} = i\\sqrt{3}$, the solutions for $y$ are $y = \\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Express the solutions in polar form\nThe solutions $y = \\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ can be expressed in polar form. Both solutions are on the unit circle in the complex plane, and their magnitudes are 1. The argument (angle) of $\\frac{1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$, and the argument of $\\frac{1 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is $-\\frac{\\pi}{3}$. Thus, $y = e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$ and $y = e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$.\n\n## Step 4: Convert back to z\nSince $y = z^2$, we have $z^2 = e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$ and $z^2 = e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $z = \\pm e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$ and $z = \\pm e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the roots of unity\nThe solutions $z = \\pm e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$ and $z = \\pm e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$ are the $12^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity because $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$ and $e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$ are primitive $12^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity, and their negatives are also $12^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
