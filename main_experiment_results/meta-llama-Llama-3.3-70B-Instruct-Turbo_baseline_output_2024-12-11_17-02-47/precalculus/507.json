    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand matrix multiplication\nTo compute the product of two matrices, we need to multiply the elements of each row of the first matrix by the elements of each column of the second matrix and sum the products.\n\n## Step 2: Multiply the first row of the first matrix by the first column of the second matrix\nThe first row of the first matrix is (2, 0) and the first column of the second matrix is (8, 1). So, the element in the first row and first column of the resulting matrix is (2 * 8) + (0 * 1) = 16.\n\n## Step 3: Multiply the first row of the first matrix by the second column of the second matrix\nThe first row of the first matrix is (2, 0) and the second column of the second matrix is (-2, 1). So, the element in the first row and second column of the resulting matrix is (2 * -2) + (0 * 1) = -4.\n\n## Step 4: Multiply the second row of the first matrix by the first column of the second matrix\nThe second row of the first matrix is (5, -3) and the first column of the second matrix is (8, 1). So, the element in the second row and first column of the resulting matrix is (5 * 8) + (-3 * 1) = 40 - 3 = 37.\n\n## Step 5: Multiply the second row of the first matrix by the second column of the second matrix\nThe second row of the first matrix is (5, -3) and the second column of the second matrix is (-2, 1). So, the element in the second row and second column of the resulting matrix is (5 * -2) + (-3 * 1) = -10 - 3 = -13.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 16 & -4 \\\\ 37 & -13 \\end{pmatrix}}$"
