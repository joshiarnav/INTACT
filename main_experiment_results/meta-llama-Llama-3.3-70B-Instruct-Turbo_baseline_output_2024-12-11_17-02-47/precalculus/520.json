    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given equation in spherical coordinates\nThe equation given is $\\rho = c$, where $\\rho$ is the radial distance from the origin in spherical coordinates, and $c$ is a positive constant.\n\n## Step 2: Interpret the meaning of the equation\nIn spherical coordinates, $\\rho$ represents the distance from any point to the origin. If this distance is fixed at $c$, it means that every point with this $\\rho$ value lies on the surface of a sphere with radius $c$, because all points at a fixed distance from a center point define a sphere.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the geometric shape described by the equation\nGiven that $\\rho = c$ describes all points at a constant distance $c$ from the origin, the shape is a sphere. This is because, by definition, a sphere is the set of all points in space that are a fixed distance (the radius) away from a given center point (the origin in this case).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(D)}$"
