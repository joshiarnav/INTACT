    "solution": "The vector pointing from $(-1,1,1)$ to $(1,-1,1)$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$  Since the plane we are interested in is perpendicular to the plane $x + 2y + 3z = 5,$ its normal vector must be orthogonal to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}.$  But the normal vector of the plane is also orthogonal to $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$  So, to find the normal vector of the plane we are interested in, we take the cross product of these vectors:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -6 \\\\ -6 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Scaling, we take $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector.  Therefore, the equation of the plane is of the form\n\\[x + y - z + D = 0.\\]Substituting the coordinates of $(-1,1,1),$ we find that the equation of the plane is $\\boxed{x + y - z + 1 = 0}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Find the normal vector to the given plane\nTo find the equation of a plane that is perpendicular to another plane, we first need a normal vector to the given plane. The coefficients of $x$, $y$, and $z$ in the equation of the given plane give the components of its normal vector. For the plane $x + 2y + 3z = 5$, the normal vector is $\\mathbf{n} = \\langle 1, 2, 3 \\rangle$.\n\n## Step 2: Find a vector in the plane we are trying to define\nTwo points $(-1,1,1)$ and $(1,-1,1)$ lie in the plane we are trying to find the equation for. A vector that lies in this plane can be found by subtracting the coordinates of these two points: $\\mathbf{v} = \\langle 1 - (-1), -1 - 1, 1 - 1 \\rangle = \\langle 2, -2, 0 \\rangle$.\n\n## Step 3: Find a normal vector to the plane we are trying to define\nSince the plane we are trying to define is perpendicular to the given plane, a normal vector to our plane will be parallel to the given plane. This means it will be perpendicular to the normal vector of the given plane. We can use the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ from Step 2 and the normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ of the given plane to find a normal vector to our plane by taking their cross product: $\\mathbf{n}_{\\text{our plane}} = \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{n}$. Calculating the cross product: $\\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ 2 & -2 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\end{vmatrix} = \\mathbf{i}(-2 \\cdot 3 - 0 \\cdot 2) - \\mathbf{j}(2 \\cdot 3 - 0 \\cdot 1) + \\mathbf{k}(2 \\cdot 2 - (-2) \\cdot 1) = \\mathbf{i}(-6) - \\mathbf{j}(6) + \\mathbf{k}(6) = \\langle -6, -6, 6 \\rangle$. Simplifying this vector by dividing all components by their greatest common divisor (which is 6) gives $\\langle -1, -1, 1 \\rangle$ as a normal vector to our plane.\n\n## Step 4: Use one of the given points and the normal vector to find the equation of the plane\nUsing the point-normal form of the equation of a plane $A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) = 0$, where $\\langle A, B, C \\rangle$ is the normal vector to the plane and $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is a point on the plane, we can substitute the normal vector $\\langle -1, -1, 1 \\rangle$ and one of the given points, say $(-1, 1, 1)$, into this equation: $-1(x - (-1)) - 1(y - 1) + 1(z - 1) = 0$. Simplifying gives $-x - 1 - y + 1 + z - 1 = 0$ or $-x - y + z - 1 = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Ensure the equation is in the required format\nThe equation $-x - y + z - 1 = 0$ needs to be in the format $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0$ where $A > 0$. Multiplying the entire equation by $-1$ to make the coefficient of $x$ positive gives $x + y - z + 1 = 0$. Now, the equation is in the correct format.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1x + 1y -1z + 1 = 0}$"
