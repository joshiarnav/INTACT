    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, let's write down the given equation and identify the variable.\nThe equation given is $2\\sin^3 x - 5 \\sin^2 x + 2 \\sin x = 0$, where $x$ is the variable.\n\n## Step 2: Factor out the common term $\\sin x$ from the equation.\nFactoring out $\\sin x$, we get $\\sin x(2\\sin^2 x - 5 \\sin x + 2) = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Factor the quadratic term $2\\sin^2 x - 5 \\sin x + 2$.\nThe quadratic term can be factored as $(2\\sin x - 1)(\\sin x - 2) = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for $\\sin x$.\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we get $\\sin x = 0$, $2\\sin x - 1 = 0$, and $\\sin x - 2 = 0$. Solving these, we find $\\sin x = 0$, $\\sin x = \\frac{1}{2}$, and $\\sin x = 2$. However, $\\sin x = 2$ is not valid since $\\sin x$ cannot exceed 1.\n\n## Step 5: Find the values of $x$ in the range $0 \\le x \\le 2\\pi$ that satisfy $\\sin x = 0$ and $\\sin x = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFor $\\sin x = 0$, $x = 0$, $\\pi$, and $2\\pi$. For $\\sin x = \\frac{1}{2}$, $x = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ and $\\frac{5\\pi}{6}$.\n\n## Step 6: Count the number of distinct solutions for $x$ in the given range.\nWe have $0$, $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$, $\\frac{5\\pi}{6}$, $\\pi$, and $2\\pi$ as solutions, which gives us a total of 5 distinct solutions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
