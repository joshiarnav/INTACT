    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the general equation of a plane\nThe general equation of a plane in three-dimensional space is given by $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0$, where $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are constants and $x$, $y$, $z$ are the variables.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the significance of the foot of the perpendicular\nThe foot of the perpendicular from the origin to the plane represents a point on the plane that is closest to the origin. This means that the line connecting the origin to this point is perpendicular to the plane.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the normal vector of the plane\nThe vector from the origin to the foot of the perpendicular, which is $(12, -4, 3)$, serves as a normal vector to the plane because it is perpendicular to the plane.\n\n## Step 4: Use the point-normal form of the equation of a plane\nGiven a point $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ that lies on a plane and a normal vector $(A, B, C)$ to the plane, the equation of the plane can be written as $A(x - x_1) + B(y - y_1) + C(z - z_1) = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute the known values into the equation\nUsing the point $(12, -4, 3)$ and the normal vector $(12, -4, 3)$, we substitute these values into the equation: $12(x - 12) - 4(y - (-4)) + 3(z - 3) = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the equation\nExpanding the equation gives $12x - 144 - 4y - 16 + 3z - 9 = 0$. Simplifying further yields $12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Ensure the equation meets the required conditions\nThe coefficients of $x$, $y$, and $z$ are already integers, $A = 12 > 0$, and we need to check if $\\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1$. Here, $\\gcd(12, 4, 3, 169) = 1$, so the equation is in the required form.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0}$"
