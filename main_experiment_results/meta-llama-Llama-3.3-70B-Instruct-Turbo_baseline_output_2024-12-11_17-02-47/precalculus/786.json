    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix, we will use the expansion method.\nWe will calculate the determinant by expanding along the first row, which involves multiplying each element in the first row by its cofactor and summing these products.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the cofactor for the first element (2) in the first row.\nThe cofactor for the first element is found by taking the determinant of the 2x2 matrix formed by removing the row and column of the first element, and then multiplying by $(-1)^{i+j}$ where i and j are the row and column indices of the element. For the first element, this means removing the first row and first column, resulting in the matrix:\n\\[\\begin{vmatrix} 4 & -3 \\\\ 2 & 5 \\end{vmatrix}.\\]\nThe determinant of this 2x2 matrix is $(4*5) - (-3*2) = 20 + 6 = 26$. Since the first element is in the first row and first column, $i=1$ and $j=1$, so $(-1)^{1+1} = 1$. Thus, the cofactor for the first element is $1 * 26 = 26$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the cofactor for the second element (0) in the first row.\nFollowing the same process, the cofactor for the second element involves removing the first row and second column, resulting in the matrix:\n\\[\\begin{vmatrix} 7 & -3 \\\\ 2 & 5 \\end{vmatrix}.\\]\nThe determinant of this 2x2 matrix is $(7*5) - (-3*2) = 35 + 6 = 41$. Since the second element is in the first row and second column, $i=1$ and $j=2$, so $(-1)^{1+2} = -1$. Thus, the cofactor for the second element is $-1 * 41 = -41$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the cofactor for the third element (-1) in the first row.\nThe cofactor for the third element involves removing the first row and third column, resulting in the matrix:\n\\[\\begin{vmatrix} 7 & 4 \\\\ 2 & 2 \\end{vmatrix}.\\]\nThe determinant of this 2x2 matrix is $(7*2) - (4*2) = 14 - 8 = 6$. Since the third element is in the first row and third column, $i=1$ and $j=3$, so $(-1)^{1+3} = 1$. Thus, the cofactor for the third element is $1 * 6 = 6$.\n\n## Step 5: Compute the determinant of the 3x3 matrix by multiplying each element in the first row by its cofactor and summing these products.\nThe determinant is calculated as $(2 * 26) + (0 * -41) + (-1 * 6) = 52 + 0 - 6 = 46$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{46}$"
