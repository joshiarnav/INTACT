    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the relationship between the angle of two vectors and the angle of their negatives.\nThe angle between two vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the same as the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $-\\mathbf{b}$, but the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is different.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the relationship between the given angle and the desired angle.\nSince the angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is $43^\\circ$, the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ will be the supplement of $43^\\circ$, because $-\\mathbf{a}$ points in the opposite direction of $\\mathbf{a}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the supplement of $43^\\circ$ to find the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$.\nThe supplement of an angle $\\theta$ is $180^\\circ - \\theta$. So, the supplement of $43^\\circ$ is $180^\\circ - 43^\\circ = 137^\\circ$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{137}$"
