    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Find the direction vector of the line\nTo find the direction vector of the line passing through points $(3,4,1)$ and $(5,1,6)$, we subtract the coordinates of the first point from the coordinates of the second point. This gives us the direction vector $\\vec{d} = (5-3, 1-4, 6-1) = (2, -3, 5)$.\n\n## Step 2: Write the parametric equation of the line\nUsing the point-slope form of a line in 3D space, with the point $(3,4,1)$ and the direction vector $\\vec{d} = (2, -3, 5)$, we can write the parametric equation of the line as $x = 3 + 2t$, $y = 4 - 3t$, and $z = 1 + 5t$, where $t$ is a parameter.\n\n## Step 3: Find the intersection with the $xy$-plane\nThe $xy$-plane is defined by $z = 0$. To find where the line intersects the $xy$-plane, we set $z = 0$ in the parametric equation $z = 1 + 5t$ and solve for $t$. This gives us $0 = 1 + 5t$, which simplifies to $5t = -1$, and thus $t = -\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the intersection\nSubstitute $t = -\\frac{1}{5}$ into the parametric equations for $x$ and $y$. For $x$, we have $x = 3 + 2(-\\frac{1}{5}) = 3 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{15}{5} - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{13}{5}$. For $y$, we have $y = 4 - 3(-\\frac{1}{5}) = 4 + \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{20}{5} + \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{23}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(\\frac{13}{5},\\frac{23}{5},0)}$"
