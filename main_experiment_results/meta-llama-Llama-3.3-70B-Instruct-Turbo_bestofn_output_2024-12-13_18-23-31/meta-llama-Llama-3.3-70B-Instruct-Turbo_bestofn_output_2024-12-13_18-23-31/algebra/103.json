    "## Step 1: Identify the terms in the first polynomial that can contribute to the $x^2$ term in the expansion.\nThe $x^2$ term in the expansion can come from multiplying $x^2$ by constant terms, $x$ by $x$ terms, or $x^2$ by constant terms from the other polynomial. In $(ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)$, the terms that can contribute to the $x^2$ term are $3x^2$ and $-2x$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the terms in the second polynomial that can contribute to the $x^2$ term in the expansion when multiplied by the terms from the first polynomial.\nFrom $(bx^2 - 7x - 4)$, the terms that can contribute when multiplied by terms from the first polynomial are $bx^2$ (which needs to be multiplied by a constant term or an $x^0$ term from the first polynomial, but since there isn't one, it will be multiplied by $-2x$ to get $x^2$ terms indirectly), $-7x$ (which can be multiplied by $-2x$ to get an $x^2$ term), and $-4$ (which can be multiplied by $3x^2$ to get an $x^2$ term).\n\n## Step 3: Multiply the terms from both polynomials that can give $x^2$ and calculate their coefficients.\n- Multiplying $3x^2$ by $-4$ gives $-12x^2$.\n- Multiplying $-2x$ by $-7x$ gives $14x^2$.\n- Multiplying $3x^2$ by $bx^2$ would give a term with a higher power of $x$, so it's not relevant for the $x^2$ term.\n- Multiplying $-2x$ by $bx^2$ gives $-2bx^3$, which is not relevant for the $x^2$ term.\n- The term $ax^3$ from the first polynomial does not contribute to the $x^2$ term because it needs to be multiplied by a term that would reduce its power, but the second polynomial does not have a term that can do this to contribute to $x^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Sum the coefficients of the $x^2$ terms obtained from the multiplication.\nThe coefficients are $-12$ from $-12x^2$ and $14$ from $14x^2$, so the sum is $-12 + 14 = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the terms that can multiply to give $x^2$\nTo find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion of the given product, we need to identify the terms from each polynomial that can multiply together to give $x^2$.

    "## Step 1: Identify the terms in the first polynomial that can contribute to the $x^2$ term in the expansion.\nThe terms in the first polynomial are $ax^3$, $3x^2$, and $-2x$. To get an $x^2$ term in the expansion, we need to consider how these terms can multiply with terms in the second polynomial to give $x^2$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the terms in the second polynomial that can contribute to the $x^2$ term in the expansion.\nThe terms in the second polynomial are $bx^2$, $-7x$, and $-4$. We need to find combinations of terms from both polynomials that multiply to give $x^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the possible combinations of terms from both polynomials that result in $x^2$.\n- The $ax^3$ term from the first polynomial can contribute to $x^2$ if it multiplies with a term that has $x^{-1}$, but since there's no $x^{-1}$ term, it won't directly contribute to $x^2$.\n- The $3x^2$ term can contribute if it multiplies with a constant term (since $x^2 \\cdot x^0 = x^2$).\n- The $-2x$ term can contribute if it multiplies with a term that has $x$ (since $x \\cdot x = x^2$).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the $x^2$ term from the product of the two polynomials based on the identified combinations.\n- The $3x^2$ term from the first polynomial multiplies with the $-4$ term from the second polynomial: $3x^2 \\cdot -4 = -12x^2$.\n- The $-2x$ term from the first polynomial multiplies with the $-7x$ term from the second polynomial: $-2x \\cdot -7x = 14x^2$.\n- Additionally, we should consider the product of $ax^3$ with any term that could result in $x^2$, but since there's no $x^{-1}$ term in the second polynomial, $ax^3$ won't contribute directly to the $x^2$ term.\n- We also need to consider the product of the $3x^2$ term with the $bx^2$ term, but this will result in $x^4$, not $x^2$.\n- Lastly, consider the $-2x$ term multiplying with $bx^2$: $-2x \\cdot bx^2 = -2bx^3$, which does not contribute to the $x^2$ term.\n\n## Step 5: Sum the coefficients of the $x^2$ terms calculated from the combinations.\nThe total $x^2$ term coefficient is the sum of the coefficients from the relevant products: $-12 + 14 = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"

  "solution": "We only need to worry about the terms that multiply to have a degree of $2$. This would be given by the product of the terms $3x^2$ and $-4$ as well as the product of the terms $-2x$ and $-7x$.
