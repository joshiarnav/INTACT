    "## Step 1: Identify the given inequality\nThe given inequality is $n^2 - 11n + 24 \\leq 0$. We need to find the greatest integer $n$ that satisfies this inequality.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the quadratic expression\nTo solve the inequality, let's first factor the quadratic expression $n^2 - 11n + 24$. It can be factored as $(n - 8)(n - 3)$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the inequality with the factored expression\nNow, we rewrite the inequality using the factored form: $(n - 8)(n - 3) \\leq 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the critical points\nThe critical points occur where $(n - 8) = 0$ or $(n - 3) = 0$. So, the critical points are $n = 8$ and $n = 3$.\n\n## Step 5: Test the intervals\nWe need to test the intervals defined by these critical points: $(-\\infty, 3)$, $(3, 8)$, and $(8, \\infty)$ to see where the inequality is satisfied.\n\n## Step 6: Test a value from each interval\nFor $n < 3$, let's test $n = 0$: $(0 - 8)(0 - 3) = (-8)(-3) = 24 > 0$. For $3 < n < 8$, let's test $n = 5$: $(5 - 8)(5 - 3) = (-3)(2) = -6 < 0$. For $n > 8$, let's test $n = 9$: $(9 - 8)(9 - 3) = (1)(6) = 6 > 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the solution interval\nFrom step 6, we see that the inequality $(n - 8)(n - 3) \\leq 0$ is satisfied when $3 \\leq n \\leq 8$.\n\n## Step 8: Find the greatest integer $n$ in the solution interval\nThe greatest integer $n$ within the interval $3 \\leq n \\leq 8$ is $8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the inequality\nWe need to find the greatest integer $n$ that satisfies the inequality $n^2 - 11n + 24 \\leq 0$. This means we are looking for the largest integer value of $n$ for which the quadratic expression is less than or equal to zero.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the quadratic expression\nTo solve this inequality, it's helpful to factor the quadratic expression. The expression $n^2 - 11n + 24$ can be factored into $(n - 8)(n - 3)$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the inequality with the factored expression\nNow, we rewrite the inequality using the factored form: $(n - 8)(n - 3) \\leq 0$. This means the product of $(n - 8)$ and $(n - 3)$ must be less than or equal to zero.\n\n## Step 4: Find the critical points\nThe critical points occur where $(n - 8) = 0$ or $(n - 3) = 0$, which gives us $n = 8$ or $n = 3$. These points divide the number line into three intervals: $(-\\infty, 3)$, $(3, 8)$, and $(8, \\infty)$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the sign of the expression in each interval\n- In the interval $(-\\infty, 3)$, both $(n - 8)$ and $(n - 3)$ are negative, so their product is positive.\n- In the interval $(3, 8)$, $(n - 8)$ is negative and $(n - 3)$ is positive, so their product is negative.\n- In the interval $(8, \\infty)$, both $(n - 8)$ and $(n - 3)$ are positive, so their product is positive.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the interval that satisfies the inequality\nThe interval where the product is less than or equal to zero is $(3, 8)$, including the endpoints where the product equals zero. Thus, $3 \\leq n \\leq 8$ satisfies the inequality.\n\n## Step 7: Find the greatest integer $n$ in the interval\nSince we are looking for the greatest integer $n$, we take the upper bound of the interval, which is $8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the inequality\nWe are given the quadratic inequality $n^2 - 11n +24 \\leq 0$. The goal is to find the greatest integer $n$ that satisfies this inequality.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the quadratic expression\nTo solve the inequality, first, we need to factor the quadratic expression. The expression $n^2 - 11n +24$ can be factored into $(n - 8)(n - 3)$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the inequality with the factored expression\nNow, we rewrite the inequality using the factored form: $(n - 8)(n - 3) \\leq 0$. This means the solutions are the values of $n$ for which the expression $(n - 8)(n - 3)$ is less than or equal to zero.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the critical points\nThe critical points occur where $(n - 8)(n - 3) = 0$. Setting each factor equal to zero gives us $n = 8$ and $n = 3$. These are the points where the expression changes sign.\n\n## Step 5: Test the intervals\nTo find where $(n - 8)(n - 3) \\leq 0$, we test the intervals defined by the critical points: $(-\\infty, 3)$, $(3, 8)$, and $(8, \\infty)$. For $n < 3$, both $(n - 8)$ and $(n - 3)$ are negative, making the product positive. For $3 < n < 8$, $(n - 8)$ is negative and $(n - 3)$ is positive, making the product negative. For $n > 8$, both factors are positive, making the product positive again.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the interval satisfying the inequality\nFrom step 5, we see that the interval $(3, 8)$ satisfies the condition $(n - 8)(n - 3) \\leq 0$ because the product is negative in this interval. Additionally, we include the endpoints $3$ and $8$ because the inequality is \"less than or equal to\" zero.\n\n## Step 7: Find the greatest integer in the interval\nThe greatest integer $n$ in the interval $[3, 8]$ is $8$, since we are looking for the largest integer that satisfies the given inequality.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"

  "solution": "We can factor $n^2-11n+24$ as $(n-3)(n-8)$. For this quantity to be less than or equal to 0, one of the factors must be less than or equal to 0 and the other factor must be greater than or equal to 0. Specifically, since $n-8<n-3$ for all $n$, we must have $$n-8 \\le 0 \\le n-3.$$ The first inequality, $n-8\\le 0$, tells us that $n\\le 8$. The second inequality, $0\\le n-3$, tells us that $n\\ge 3$. The solutions to the original inequality must satisfy both conditions, so they are given by $3\\le n\\le 8$. The largest integer in this interval is $n=\\boxed{8}$.",
