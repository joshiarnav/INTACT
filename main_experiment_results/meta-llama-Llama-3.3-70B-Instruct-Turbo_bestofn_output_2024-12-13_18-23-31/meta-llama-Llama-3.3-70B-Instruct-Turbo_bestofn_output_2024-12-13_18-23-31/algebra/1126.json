    "To find the vertical asymptote of the given function $y=\\frac{x+2}{5x-7}$, we need to determine the value of $x$ that makes the denominator equal to zero, since a fraction becomes undefined when its denominator is zero.\n\nThe denominator of the function is $5x-7$. To find the value of $x$ that makes this expression equal to zero, we can set up the equation:\n\n$5x-7=0$\n\nNow, we can solve for $x$:\n\n$5x=7$\n\n$x=\\frac{7}{5}$\n\nTherefore, the vertical asymptote occurs at $x=\\frac{7}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{5}}$",
