    "## Step 1: Define the function h(u)\nGiven $h(4x-1) = 2x + 7$, let's define $u = 4x - 1$. This means $x = \\frac{u + 1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute x in terms of u into the equation for h(4x-1)\nSubstituting $x = \\frac{u + 1}{4}$ into $h(4x-1) = 2x + 7$ gives $h(u) = 2\\left(\\frac{u + 1}{4}\\right) + 7$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation for h(u)\nSimplifying $h(u) = 2\\left(\\frac{u + 1}{4}\\right) + 7$ yields $h(u) = \\frac{u + 1}{2} + 7 = \\frac{u + 1 + 14}{2} = \\frac{u + 15}{2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Set up the equation h(x) = x\nNow we need to find $x$ for which $h(x) = x$. Substituting $h(x) = \\frac{x + 15}{2}$ into the equation gives $\\frac{x + 15}{2} = x$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the equation for x\nMultiplying both sides of the equation $\\frac{x + 15}{2} = x$ by 2 gives $x + 15 = 2x$. Subtracting $x$ from both sides yields $15 = x$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",

  "solution": "First, we find an expression for $h(x)$.  From our definition of $h$, we have $h(4y-1) = 2y+7$.  So, if we let $x=4y-1$, so that $y = (x+1)/4$, we have  \\[h(x) = 2\\cdot\\frac{x+1}{4} + 7 = \\frac{x+1}{2} + 7.\\] Setting this equal to $x$ gives \\[x =\\frac{x+1}{2} + 7.\\] Multiplying both sides by 2 gives $2x = x+1 + 14$, so $x = \\boxed{15}$.",
