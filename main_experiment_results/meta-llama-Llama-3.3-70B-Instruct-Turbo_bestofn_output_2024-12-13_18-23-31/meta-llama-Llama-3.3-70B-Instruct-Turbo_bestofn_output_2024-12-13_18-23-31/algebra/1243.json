  "critique": "## Step 1: Analyze the first solution for clarity and correctness.\nThe first solution clearly explains the properties of the imaginary unit \\( i \\) and how its powers cycle every 4 steps. It then applies this understanding to simplify each term in the given expression and finally adds these simplified terms together to get the answer.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the second solution for clarity and correctness.\nThe second solution also correctly explains the properties of \\( i \\) and applies modular arithmetic to simplify each power of \\( i \\). The explanation is concise and directly leads to the simplified form of each term, which are then added together to find the final answer.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the third solution for clarity and correctness.\nThe third solution similarly explains the cycling of \\( i \\)'s powers and applies this to simplify each term. It uses the same method of finding remainders when dividing exponents by 4 to determine the simplified form of each power of \\( i \\), and then adds these simplified terms together.\n\n## Step 4: Compare the solutions for efficiency, clarity, and correctness.\nAll three solutions are correct and follow a similar logical process. However, Solution 2 is slightly more concise in its explanation of simplifying powers of \\( i \\) using modular arithmetic, making it perhaps easier to follow for those familiar with this concept.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the best solution based on the comparison.\nGiven that all solutions are essentially correct and clear, but considering the request for the \"best\" solution, we look for the one that might be most efficient or easiest to understand. Solution 2 is chosen because it directly applies modular arithmetic to simplify the terms, which can be a quick and efficient method for those familiar with it.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
  "solution": "We know that by definition, $i^2=-1$, so $i^4=(-1)^2=1.$ More generally, for all integers k, $i^{4k}=(i^4)^k=1^k=1$. This means that $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}= i^8(i^3)+i^{16}(1)+i^{20}(i)+i^{24}(i^2)+i^{28}(i^3)=i^3+1+i+i^2+i^3$. Since $i^3=-i$, we can simplify this to get our final result: $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}=-i+1+i-1-i=\\boxed{-i}.$",
