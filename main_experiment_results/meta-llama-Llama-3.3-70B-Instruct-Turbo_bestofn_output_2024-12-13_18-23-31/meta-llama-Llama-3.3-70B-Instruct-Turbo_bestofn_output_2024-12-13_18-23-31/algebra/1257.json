    "## Step 1: Understand the function $f(x) = x^k$ where $k < 0$\nThe function $f(x) = x^k$ where $k < 0$ represents a decreasing function because when $k$ is negative, as $x$ increases, $f(x)$ decreases. This is characteristic of functions where $k$ is less than 0.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the behavior of the function on the interval $[1, \\infty)$\nSince $k < 0$, the function $f(x)$ is a decreasing! function on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. At $x = 1$, $f(1) = 1^k = 1$ for any $k$, including negative $k$. As $x$ approaches infinity, $f(x) = x^k$ approaches 0 because a negative exponent causes the function to decrease towards 0 as the base increases.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$\nGiven that $f(x)$ starts at 1 (when $x = 1$) and decreases towards 0 (as $x$ approaches infinity), the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ includes all values between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive). This is because $f(x)$ will never actually reach 0, but gets infinitely close to it as $x$ goes to infinity.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(0, 1]}$",
    "## Step 1: Understanding the function\nThe given function is $f(x) = x^k$ where $k < 0$. This implies that $f(x)$ is a decreasing function as $x$ increases because when $k$ is negative, as $x$ increases, $x^k$ decreases.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluating the function at the interval boundaries\nTo find the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$, we need to evaluate $f(x)$ at the boundaries of the interval. At $x = 1$, $f(1) = 1^k = 1$ for any value of $k$, including negative $k$. As $x$ approaches $\\infty$, $f(x) = x^k$ approaches $0$ because a negative exponent causes the function to decrease towards $0$ as the base increases.\n\n## Step 3: Determining the behavior of the function within the interval\nSince $k < 0$, $f(x)$ is a decreasing function over the interval $[1, \\infty)$. This means that the maximum value of $f(x)$ in this interval is at $x = 1$, where $f(1) = 1$, and the minimum value approaches $0$ as $x$ approaches $\\infty$.\n\n## Step 4: Defining the range\nGiven that the function starts at $1$ and decreases towards $0$ without reaching it as $x$ goes from $1$ to $\\infty$, the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ is $(0, 1]$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(0, 1]}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given function and its behavior\nThe function given is $f(x) = x^k$ where $k < 0$. Since $k$ is less than 0, $f(x)$ represents a function with a form of $1/x^n$ where $n > 0$. This type of function is a decreasing function for all $x > 0$ because as $x$ increases, $f(x)$ decreases, and vice versa.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the behavior of the function on the interval $[1, \\infty)$\nGiven the interval $[1, \\infty)$, we need to evaluate how $f(x)$ behaves as $x$ ranges from 1 to infinity. Since $k < 0$, as $x$ increases, $x^k$ decreases. At $x = 1$, $f(x) = 1^k = 1$ for any $k$, including negative $k$. As $x$ approaches infinity, $x^k$ approaches 0, because a negative exponent causes the function value to decrease towards 0 as the base increases.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the range of $f(x)$ on the given interval\nSince $f(x)$ starts at 1 (when $x = 1$) and decreases towards 0 (as $x$ approaches infinity), and given that $f(x)$ is continuous and decreasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$, the range of $f(x)$ includes all values between 0 (exclusive, since it's approached but not reached) and 1 (inclusive, since it's reached at $x = 1$).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(0, 1]}$"

  "solution": "We are looking at the range of $f(x)$ when $x$ is in the interval $[1,\\infty)$. Because $k < 0$, $f(x)$ is decreasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. We see that $f(1) = 1^k = 1$, and as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ approaches 0, but never reaches it.  Hence, on the interval $[1,\\infty)$, $f(x)$ takes on all values between 0 (exclusive) and 1 inclusive, which means the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{(0,1]}$.",
