  "problem": "Phoenix hiked the Rocky Path Trail last week. It took four days to complete the trip. The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles. The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day. The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles. The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles. How many miles long was the trail?",

    "## Step 1: Define variables for each day's hike\nLet's denote the miles hiked on the first day as $a$, the second day as $b$, the third day as $c$, and the fourth day as $d$.\n\n## Step 2: Translate given information into equations\nFrom the problem, we have the following equations:\n1. $a + b = 22$ (The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles)\n2. $\\frac{b + c}{2} = 13$ (The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day)\n3. $c + d = 30$ (The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles)\n4. $a + c = 26$ (The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles)\n\n## Step 3: Solve equation 2 for $b + c$\nMultiplying both sides of equation 2 by 2 gives $b + c = 26$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the equations to find the value of each variable\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously. From equation 1, we have $b = 22 - a$. From equation 4, we have $c = 26 - a$. Substituting $b$ and $c$ into the equation $b + c = 26$ gives $22 - a + 26 - a = 26$, which simplifies to $48 - 2a = 26$, leading to $-2a = -22$ and thus $a = 11$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the value of $b$\nSubstitute $a = 11$ into $a + b = 22$ to get $11 + b = 22$, which simplifies to $b = 11$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the value of $c$\nSubstitute $a = 11$ into $a + c = 26$ to get $11 + c = 26$, which simplifies to $c = 15$.\n\n## Step 7: Find the value of $d$\nSubstitute $c = 15$ into $c + d = 30$ to get $15 + d = 30$, which simplifies to $d = 15$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total length of the trail\nThe total length of the trail is $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52$ miles.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{52}$",

From equation 1, we have $a = 22 - b$. From equation 4, substituting $a$ from equation 1, we get $22 - b + c = 26$, which simplifies to $c - b = 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Use the simplified equation from step 3 and the result from step 4\nFrom step 3, we have $b + c = 26$, and from step 4, $c - b = 4$. Adding these two equations gives $2c = 30$, which means $c = 15$. Substituting $c = 15$ into $c - b = 4$ gives $15 - b = 4$, so $b = 11$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the values of $a$ and $d$\nNow that we have $b = 11$, we can find $a$ using $a + b = 22$, which gives $a = 22 - 11 = 11$. With $c = 15$, using $c + d = 30$, we find $d = 30 - 15 = 15$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total length of the trail\nThe total length of the trail is $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{52}$",
