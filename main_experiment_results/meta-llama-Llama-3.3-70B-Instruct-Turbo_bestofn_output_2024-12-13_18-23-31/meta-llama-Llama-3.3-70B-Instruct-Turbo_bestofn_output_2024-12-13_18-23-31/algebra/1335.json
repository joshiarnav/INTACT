    "## Step 1: Understand the given operation\nThe operation $\\#$ is defined as $a \\# b = a + \\frac{a}{b}$. This means we need to add $a$ to the result of dividing $a$ by $b$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the operation to the given values\nGiven $a = 6$ and $b = 2$, we substitute these values into the definition of the operation: $6 \\# 2 = 6 + \\frac{6}{2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the arithmetic\nNow, we perform the arithmetic to find the result: $6 + \\frac{6}{2} = 6 + 3$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final result\nFinally, we calculate the sum: $6 + 3 = 9$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",
