    "## Step 1: Express both sides of the equation with the same base.\nWe start by recognizing that 27 can be expressed as $3^3$ and 9 can be expressed as $3^2$. Therefore, we rewrite the equation as $(3^3)^8 = (3^2)^q$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the power of a power rule to both sides of the equation.\nUsing the power of a power rule, we simplify both sides of the equation: $3^{3*8} = 3^{2*q}$. This simplifies to $3^{24} = 3^{2q}$.\n\n## Step 3: Set the exponents equal to each other.\nSince the bases are the same on both sides of the equation, we can set the exponents equal to each other: $24 = 2q$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $q$.\nTo solve for $q$, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: $q = 24 / 2$. Therefore, $q = 12$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
