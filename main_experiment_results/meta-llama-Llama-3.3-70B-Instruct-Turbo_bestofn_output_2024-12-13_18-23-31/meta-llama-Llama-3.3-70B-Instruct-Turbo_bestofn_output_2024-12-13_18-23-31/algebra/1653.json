    "## Step 1: To find the area of the triangular region, we first need to determine the coordinates where the line intersects the x and y axes.\nThe equation given is $2x + y = 6$. To find the y-intercept, we let $x = 0$ and solve for $y$. This gives $y = 6$. For the x-intercept, we let $y = 0$ and solve for $x$, which gives $2x = 6$ and thus $x = 3$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the area of the triangle using the formula for the area of a triangle.\nThe formula for the area of a triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times base \\times height$. In this case, the base of the triangle is the x-intercept (3 units), and the height is the y-intercept (6 units).\n\n## Step 3: Apply the formula with the given values.\nSubstitute the base and height into the formula: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 6$.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the calculation.\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 6 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 18 = 9$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the equation of the line\nThe equation given is $2x + y = 6$. This equation represents a line in the slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the equation to slope-intercept form\nTo find the y-intercept and the x-intercept, we need to convert the equation into slope-intercept form. Rearranging the terms, we get $y = -2x + 6$. This means the y-intercept is 6.\n\n## Step 3: Find the x-intercept of the line\nTo find the x-intercept, set $y = 0$ in the equation $2x + y = 6$. This gives $2x + 0 = 6$, which simplifies to $2x = 6$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 3$. So, the x-intercept is 3.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the vertices of the triangle\nThe vertices of the triangle are the x-intercept, the y-intercept, and the origin (0, 0). From the previous steps, we have the x-intercept as (3, 0) and the y-intercept as (0, 6).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the area of the triangle\nThe area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. In this case, the base is the distance from the origin to the x-intercept, which is 3 units, and the height is the distance from the origin to the y-intercept, which is 6 units.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the area formula\nSubstituting the values into the formula, we get $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 6 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 18 = 9$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the equation of the line\nThe equation given is $2x + y = 6$. This can be rearranged in slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. Rearranging, we get $y = -2x + 6$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the y-intercept\nFrom the rearranged equation $y = -2x + 6$, we can see that the y-intercept, where $x = 0$, is $y = 6$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the x-intercept\nTo find the x-intercept, set $y = 0$ in the original equation $2x + y = 6$. This gives $2x = 6$, and solving for $x$ yields $x = 3$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the triangular region\nThe area of a triangle is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. In this case, the base of the triangle is the x-intercept (3 units), and the height is the y-intercept (6 units).

  "solution": "To start, use the equation to solve for the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the line.  Letting $x$ equal 0, the $y$-intercept is 6.  Letting $y$ equal 0, we find that $2x=6$ so the $x$-intercept is 3.
