    "## Step 1: Calculate the ratio of the volumes of the two boxes\nTo find out how many paperclips the larger box can hold, we first need to determine the ratio of the volumes of the two boxes. The volume of the smaller box is 16 $\\text{cm}^3$, and the volume of the larger box is 48 $\\text{cm}^3$. The ratio of the larger box to the smaller box is 48 / 16.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the ratio\nSimplifying the ratio gives us 48 / 16 = 3. This means the larger box has 3 times the volume of the smaller box.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the ratio to the number of paperclips the smaller box can hold\nSince the smaller box can hold 50 paperclips, and the larger box has 3 times the volume, we can multiply the number of paperclips the smaller box can hold by 3 to find out how many paperclips the larger box can hold. So, 50 * 3 = 150.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{150}$",

Therefore, it can hold 3 times as many paperclips as the smaller box.\n   - Number of paperclips smaller box can hold = 50\n   - Number of paperclips larger box can hold = 3 * Number of paperclips smaller box can hold = 3 * 50 = 150\n\nTherefore, a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ could hold $\\boxed{150}$ paperclips.",
    "To determine how many paperclips a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold, we first need to establish the ratio of paperclips to volume in the smaller box and then apply that ratio to the larger box.\n\n1. **Establish the ratio of paperclips to volume in the smaller box:**\n   - Volume of the smaller box = 16 $\\text{cm}^3$\n   - Number of paperclips the smaller box can hold = 50\n   - Ratio = Number of paperclips / Volume = 50 / 16\n\n2. **Calculate the number of paperclips the larger box can hold:**\n   - Volume of the larger box = 48 $\\text{cm}^3$\n   - Using the ratio from the smaller box, we calculate the number of paperclips the larger box can hold as follows:\n     - Number of paperclips in the larger box = (50 / 16) * 48\n\n3. **Perform the calculation:**\n   - Number of paperclips in the larger box = (50 / 16) * 48\n   - Simplify the fraction first: 50 / 16 = 3.125\n   - Then multiply by 48: 3.125 * 48 = 150\n\nTherefore, a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ could hold $\\boxed{150}$ paperclips."

  "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of paperclips that a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ could hold. Setting up the ratio $\\frac{50}{16}=\\frac{x}{48}$ and solving for $x$ gives $x=150$.  Hence, a 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ box could hold $\\boxed{150}$ paperclips.  We also could have noted that tripling the size of the box triples the number of paperclips we can hold, so the new box can hold $50\\cdot 3 = 150$ paperclips.",
