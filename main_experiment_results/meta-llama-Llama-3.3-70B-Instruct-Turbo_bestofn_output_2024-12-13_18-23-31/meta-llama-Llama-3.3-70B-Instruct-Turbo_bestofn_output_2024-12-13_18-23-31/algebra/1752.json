    "## Step 1: Find the midpoint of the line segment from (2,5) to (4,9).\nTo find the midpoint, we use the midpoint formula: $\\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\\right)$. Substituting the given points, we get $\\left(\\frac{2+4}{2}, \\frac{5+9}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{6}{2}, \\frac{14}{2}\\right) = (3, 7)$.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the midpoint into the equation of the line $x+y=b$ to find $b$.\nThe midpoint $(3, 7)$ lies on the line $x+y=b$. Substituting $x=3$ and $y=7$ into the equation, we get $3+7=b$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $b$.\nSolving the equation $3+7=b$, we find $b=10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",
