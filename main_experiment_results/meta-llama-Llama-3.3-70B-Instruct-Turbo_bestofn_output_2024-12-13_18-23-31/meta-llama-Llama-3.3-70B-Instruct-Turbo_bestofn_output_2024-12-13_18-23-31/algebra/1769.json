    "## Step 1: Identify the given expression\nThe given expression is $\\displaystyle\\frac{235^2-221^2}{14}$. This involves the difference of squares in the numerator.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the difference of squares formula\nThe difference of squares formula states that $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$. Applying this to the given expression, we get $\\displaystyle\\frac{(235+221)(235-221)}{14}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression\nNow, simplify the expression inside the parentheses: $(235+221) = 456$ and $(235-221) = 14$. So, the expression becomes $\\displaystyle\\frac{456 \\times 14}{14}$.\n\n## Step 4: Cancel out the common factor\nNotice that 14 is present in both the numerator and the denominator. These can be canceled out, leaving us with $456$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{456}$",
