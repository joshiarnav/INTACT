    "## Step 1: To find the points of intersection between the two parabolas, we need to set their equations equal to each other, because at the points of intersection, their y-values will be the same for the same x-value.\nWe have the equations $y=2x^2-7x+1$ and $y=8x^2+5x+1$. Setting them equal gives $2x^2-7x+1 = 8x^2+5x+1$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the equation by combining like terms to solve for x.\nSubtract $2x^2$ from both sides, add $7x$ to both sides, and subtract $1$ from both sides to get $0 = 6x^2 + 12x$. This simplifies further to $0 = 6x(x + 2)$ after factoring out a $6x$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation for x.\nThe equation $0 = 6x(x + 2)$ can be solved by setting each factor equal to zero. So, $6x = 0$ or $x + 2 = 0$. Solving these gives $x = 0$ or $x = -2$.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute the x-values back into one of the original equations to find the corresponding y-values.\nFor $x = 0$, substituting into $y = 2x^2 - 7x + 1$ gives $y = 2(0)^2 - 7(0) + 1 = 1$.\nFor $x = -2$, substituting into $y = 2x^2 - 7x + 1$ gives $y = 2(-2)^2 - 7(-2) + 1 = 8 + 14 + 1 = 23$.\n\n## Step 5: List the points of intersection in order of increasing x-coordinate.\nThe points are $(-2, 23)$ and $(0, 1)$. In order of increasing x-coordinate, the list is $(-2, 23); (0, 1)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(-2, 23); (0, 1)}$",
    "## Step 1: To find the points where the two parabolas intersect, we need to set their equations equal to each other and solve for x.\nThe equation for the first parabola is $y=2x^2-7x+1$ and the equation for the second parabola is $y=8x^2+5x+1$. Setting them equal gives $2x^2-7x+1 = 8x^2+5x+1$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the equation by combining like terms.\nSubtracting $2x^2$ from both sides gives $-7x+1 = 6x^2+5x+1$. Subtracting $5x$ from both sides gives $-12x+1 = 6x^2+1$. Subtracting 1 from both sides gives $-12x = 6x^2$. Dividing both sides by 6 gives $-2x = x^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation.\nRearranging gives $x^2 + 2x = 0$. Factoring out x gives $x(x + 2) = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the quadratic equation for x.\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives two solutions: $x = 0$ and $x + 2 = 0$, which means $x = -2$.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute the x-values back into one of the original equations to find the corresponding y-values.\nFor $x = 0$, substituting into $y=2x^2-7x+1$ gives $y = 2(0)^2 - 7(0) + 1 = 1$. For $x = -2$, substituting into $y=2x^2-7x+1$ gives $y = 2(-2)^2 - 7(-2) + 1 = 8 + 14 + 1 = 23$.\n\n## Step 6: List the points of intersection in order of increasing x-coordinate.\nThe points are $(0, 1)$ and $(-2, 23)$. In order of increasing x-coordinate, the points are $(-2, 23); (0, 1)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(-2, 23); (0, 1)}$",

This gives us two possible values for $x$: $x=0$ and $x=-2$.\n\n## Step 4: Now, we substitute these $x$ values back into one of the original equations to find the corresponding $y$ values.\nFor $x=0$, using $y=2x^2-7x+1$, we get $y=2(0)^2-7(0)+1=1$. For $x=-2$, we get $y=2(-2)^2-7(-2)+1=2(4)+14+1=8+14+1=23$.\n\n## Step 5: Finally, we list the points of intersection in order of increasing $x$-coordinate.\nThe points are $(-2, 23)$ and $(0, 1)$.
