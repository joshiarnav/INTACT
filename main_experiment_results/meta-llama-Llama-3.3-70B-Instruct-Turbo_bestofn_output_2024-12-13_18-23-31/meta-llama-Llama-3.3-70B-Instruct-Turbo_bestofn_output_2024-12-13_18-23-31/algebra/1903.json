    "## Step 1: Convert the given logarithmic equation to exponential form\nWe start with the equation $\\log_9 (x-2) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Converting this to exponential form gives us $9^{\\frac{1}{2}} = x - 2$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve for x\nSince $9^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 3$, we have $3 = x - 2$. Solving for x gives us $x = 3 + 2 = 5$.\n\n## Step 3: Find $\\log_{625} x$\nNow that we know $x = 5$, we need to find $\\log_{625} 5$. Recognizing that $625 = 5^4$, we can rewrite this as $\\log_{5^4} 5$.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the change of base formula\nUsing the change of base formula $\\log_b a = \\frac{1}{\\log_a b}$ and knowing that $\\log_{a^n} b = \\frac{1}{n} \\log_a b$, we find that $\\log_{5^4} 5 = \\frac{1}{4} \\log_5 5$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the logarithm\nSince $\\log_a a = 1$, we have $\\log_5 5 = 1$. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{4} \\log_5 5 = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$",
