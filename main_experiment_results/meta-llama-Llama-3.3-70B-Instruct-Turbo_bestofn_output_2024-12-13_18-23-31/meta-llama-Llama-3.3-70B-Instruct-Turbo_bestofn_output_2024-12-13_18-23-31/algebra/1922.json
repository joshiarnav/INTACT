    "## Step 1: Distribute the coefficients in the first term\nTo find the coefficient of $x$, we need to simplify the given expression step by step. We start with the first term, $3(x - 4)$, and distribute the $3$ to get $3x - 12$.\n\n## Step 2: Distribute the coefficients in the second term\nNext, we look at the second term, $4(7 - 2x^2 + 5x)$, and distribute the $4$ to get $28 - 8x^2 + 20x$.\n\n## Step 3: Distribute the coefficients in the third term\nThen, we examine the third term, $-8(2x - 1)$, and distribute the $-8$ to get $-16x + 8$.\n\n## Step 4: Combine like terms from all the distributed terms\nNow, we combine all the terms: $3x - 12 + 28 - 8x^2 + 20x - 16x + 8$. Simplifying this gives $-8x^2 + (3x + 20x - 16x) + (28 - 12 + 8)$, which further simplifies to $-8x^2 + 7x + 24$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the coefficient of $x$\nThe coefficient of $x$ in the simplified expression $-8x^2 + 7x + 24$ is $7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
    "## Step 1: First, we need to distribute the coefficients to the terms inside the parentheses for each part of the expression.\nFor the first part, $3(x - 4)$, we distribute the 3 to get $3x - 12$. For the second part, $4(7 - 2x^2 + 5x)$, we distribute the 4 to get $28 - 8x^2 + 20x$. For the last part, $-8(2x - 1)$, we distribute the -8 to get $-16x + 8$.\n\n## Step 2: Now, we combine like terms from each part of the expression.\nCombining all the terms, we have $3x - 12 + 28 - 8x^2 + 20x - 16x + 8$. Simplifying this gives $-8x^2 + (3x + 20x - 16x) + (28 - 12 + 8)$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression further by combining the coefficients of $x$ and the constants.\nThe coefficient of $x$ is $3 + 20 - 16 = 7$. The constants combine to $28 - 12 + 8 = 24$. So, the simplified expression is $-8x^2 + 7x + 24$.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the coefficient of $x$ in the simplified expression.\nThe coefficient of $x$ in the expression $-8x^2 + 7x + 24$ is 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
    "## Step 1: Distribute the coefficients in the first term\nTo simplify the given expression, we first distribute the coefficients in each term. For the first term $3(x - 4)$, we distribute $3$ across the terms inside the parentheses, which gives $3x - 12$.\n\n## Step 2: Distribute the coefficients in the second term\nFor the second term $4(7 - 2x^2 + 5x)$, we distribute $4$ across the terms inside the parentheses. This yields $28 - 8x^2 + 20x$.\n\n## Step 3: Distribute the coefficients in the third term\nFor the third term $-8(2x - 1)$, we distribute $-8$ across the terms inside the parentheses, resulting in $-16x + 8$.\n\n## Step 4: Combine all the distributed terms into a single expression\nCombining all the terms from the previous steps, we have $3x - 12 + 28 - 8x^2 + 20x - 16x + 8$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression\nNow, let's simplify the expression by combining like terms. The terms with $x^2$ are $-8x^2$. The terms with $x$ are $3x + 20x - 16x$, which simplifies to $7x$. The constant terms are $-12 + 28 + 8$, which simplifies to $24$. Therefore, the simplified expression is $-8x^2 + 7x + 24$.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the coefficient of $x$\nThe coefficient of $x$ in the simplified expression $-8x^2 + 7x + 24$ is $7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
