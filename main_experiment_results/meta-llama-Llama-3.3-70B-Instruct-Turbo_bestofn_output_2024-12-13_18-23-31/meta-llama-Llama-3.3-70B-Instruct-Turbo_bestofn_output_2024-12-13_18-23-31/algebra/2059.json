    "## Step 1: Recall the definition of logarithm\nThe logarithm $\\log_{10}{x}$ gives us the power to which 10 must be raised to obtain $x$. In other words, if $y = \\log_{10}{x}$, then $10^y = x$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the range of $\\log_{10}{17}$\nWe need to find the consecutive integers $a$ and $b$ such that $a < \\log_{10}{17} < b$. To do this, we can consider the powers of 10 that are closest to 17. Since $10^1 = 10$ and $10^2 = 100$, $\\log_{10}{17}$ must be between 1 and 2.\n\n## Step 3: Identify $a$ and $b$\nFrom the previous step, it is clear that $a = 1$ and $b = 2$, because $\\log_{10}{17}$ is greater than 1 (since 17 is greater than 10) and less than 2 (since 17 is less than 100).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $a + b$\nTo find $a + b$, we simply add the values of $a$ and $b$ together: $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

  "solution": "We can have $\\log_{10}10=1$ and $\\log_{10}100=2$.  Since $\\log_{10}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\\log_{10}10<\\log_{10}17<\\log_{10}100$, meaning $1<\\log_{10}17<2$.  Thus, the desired sum is $1+2=\\boxed{3}$.",
