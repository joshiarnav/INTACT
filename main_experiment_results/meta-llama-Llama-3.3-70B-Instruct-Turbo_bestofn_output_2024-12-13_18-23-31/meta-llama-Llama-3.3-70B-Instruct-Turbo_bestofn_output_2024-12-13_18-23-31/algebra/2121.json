    "## Step 1: Understand what the problem is asking for\nWe are looking for the ones digit of the first prime number, $a$, in an increasing arithmetic sequence where all four numbers ($a$, $b$, $c$, $d$) are prime, the common difference is 6, and $a > 5$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine possible ones digits for prime numbers greater than 5\nPrime numbers greater than 5 can only end in 1, 3, 7, or 9.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the common difference and its impact on the sequence\nGiven that the common difference is 6, we need to find a sequence where adding 6 to the ones digit of $a$ results in a valid ones digit for a prime number, and repeating this process two more times also results in valid ones digits for prime numbers.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the possibilities for $a$'s ones digit\nIf $a$ ends in 1, then $b$ ends in 7, $c$ ends in 3, and $d$ ends in 9, which is a valid sequence.\nIf $a$ ends in 3, then $b$ ends in 9, $c$ ends in 5, which is not valid since 5 is not a possible ones digit for prime numbers in this context (as it would be part of the sequence and not lead to a prime for $d$).\nIf $a$ ends in 7, then $b$ ends in 3, $c$ ends in 9, and $d$ ends in 5, which is not valid for the same reason as above.\nIf $a$ ends in 9, then $b$ ends in 5, which is not valid since a prime cannot end in 5 in this sequence.\n\n## Step 5: Conclude which ones digit $a$ must have\nFrom step 4, the only valid sequence starts with $a$ ending in 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

    "## Step 1: Identify the constraints and requirements of the problem.\nWe are given four primes $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ that form an increasing arithmetic sequence. The common difference between consecutive terms is 6, and $a > 5$. We need to find the ones digit of $a$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the possible ones digits of prime numbers greater than 5.\nPrime numbers greater than 5 can have ones digits of 1, 3, 7, or 9. This is because any number ending in 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8 is either divisible by 2 or 5, and thus not prime (except for the number 2 itself).\n\n## Step 3: Consider the sequence and the common difference to narrow down the options for the ones digit of $a$.\nGiven the common difference of 6, we should consider how adding 6 to the ones digit of $a$ would affect the sequence. Since $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are all prime, each term in the sequence must end in one of the possible prime digits (1, 3, 7, 9).\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the effect of adding 6 to each possible ones digit of $a$.\n- If $a$ ends in 1, $b$ would end in 7 (since $1 + 6 = 7$), $c$ would end in 3 (since $7 + 6 = 13$, and $3$ is the ones digit of $13$), and $d$ would end in 9 (since $3 + 6 = 9$). This sequence works because all the resulting digits (1, 7, 3, 9) are valid ones digits for prime numbers.\n- If $a$ ends in 3, $b$ would end in 9 (since $3 + 6 = 9$), $c$ would end in 5 (since $9 + 6 = 15$, and $5$ is the ones digit of $15$), which does not work because 5 is not a valid ones digit for a prime greater than 5 in this context.\n- If $a$ ends in 7, $b$ would end in 3 (since $7 + 6 = 13$, and $3$ is the ones digit of $13$), $c$ would end in 9 (since $3 + 6 = 9$), and $d$ would end in 5 (since $9 + 6 = 15$, and $5$ is the ones digit of $15$), which does not work because 5 is not a valid ones digit for a prime greater than 5 in this context.\n- If $a$ ends in 9, $b$ would end in 5 (since $9 + 6 = 15$, and $5$ is the ones digit of $15$), which does not work because 5 is not a valid ones digit for a prime greater than 5 in this context.\n\n## Step 5: Conclude the ones digit of $a$ based on the valid sequence.\nFrom the analysis, the only valid sequence where all terms can be prime (given the constraints) is when $a$ ends in 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"

  "solution": "Every prime number greater than 5 has a ones digit of 1, 3, 7, or 9.  For each of these digits, let's add 6, take the resulting ones digit, and repeat the process two more times. We get the following sequences of digits. \\begin{align*}\n1, 7, 3, 9 \\\\\n3, 9, 5, 1 \\\\\n7, 3, 9, 5 \\\\\n9, 5, 1, 7\n\\end{align*} Only the first of these sequences could be the sequence of ones digits of four prime numbers, since each of the other three sequences contains 5.  Therefore, the units digit of $a$ is $\\boxed{1}$. The example $a=11$ shows that there exists such a sequence of consecutive prime numbers.",
