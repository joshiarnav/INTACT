    "## Step 1: Multiply both sides by the denominator\nWe start by multiplying both sides of the equation by the denominator of the left-hand side, which is $x^2-7x-30$, to clear the fractions. This gives us \\[5x+2 = A(x+3) + B(x-10).\\]\n\n## Step 2: Factor the denominator\nThe denominator $x^2-7x-30$ can be factored into $(x-10)(x+3)$, which is useful for finding a common denominator when adding the fractions on the right-hand side.\n\n## Step 3: Choose suitable values for x to solve for A and B\nTo solve for $A$ and $B$, we can choose values of $x$ that will make one of the terms on the right-hand side disappear. Setting $x = 10$ will make the term with $B$ disappear, and setting $x = -3$ will make the term with $A$ disappear.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for A\nSetting $x = 10$ gives us \\[5(10) + 2 = A(10+3) + B(0)\\] which simplifies to \\[52 = 13A\\]. Solving for $A$ gives us \\[A = \\frac{52}{13} = 4\\].\n\n## Step 5: Solve for B\nSetting $x = -3$ gives us \\[5(-3) + 2 = A(0) + B(-3-10)\\] which simplifies to \\[-13 = -13B\\]. Solving for $B$ gives us \\[B = \\frac{-13}{-13} = 1\\].\n\n## Step 6: Write the solution as an ordered pair\nThus, we have found $A = 4$ and $B = 1$, so the solution is $(A,B) = (4,1)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(4, 1)}$",

Setting $x = 10$ will make the term with $B$ zero, and setting $x = -3$ will make the term with $A$ zero.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for A\nSetting $x = 10$, we get \\[5(10) + 2 = A(10+3) + B(0)\\] which simplifies to \\[52 = 13A\\].

Solving for $B$, we find \\[B = \\frac{-13}{-13} = 1\\].\n\n## Step 5: Write the solution as an ordered pair\nNow that we have found $A = 4$ and $B = 1$, we can write the solution as an ordered pair $(A,B)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(4, 1)}$",
