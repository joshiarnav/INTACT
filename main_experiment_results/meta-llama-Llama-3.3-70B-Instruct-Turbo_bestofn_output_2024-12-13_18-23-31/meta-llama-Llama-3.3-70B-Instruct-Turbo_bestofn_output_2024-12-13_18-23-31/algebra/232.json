    "## Step 1: Calculate the amount added to Jenna's original bill on the 30th day past its due date.\nA 1% late charge was added to Jenna's bill. To find 1% of $400, we calculate 0.01 * 400 = $4.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total bill after the first late charge.\nThe original bill was $400, and $4 was added as a late charge. So, the total bill after the first late charge is 400 + 4 = $404.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the amount added to Jenna's bill because she did not pay in the next 30 days.\nAnother 1% increase was applied to the $404 total. To find 1% of $404, we calculate 0.01 * 404 = $4.04.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final total bill after the second increase.\nThe total bill after the first late charge was $404, and $4.04 was added as the second late charge. So, the final total bill is 404 + 4.04 = $408.04.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{408.04}$",

  "solution": "The first late charge brings the bill to $400 \\cdot 1.01 = 400 + 4 = 404$. The second late charge brings the bill to $404 \\cdot 1.01 = 404 + 4.04 = \\boxed{408.04}$ dollars.\n\n-OR-\n\nEach increase multiples the bill by $1+1\\%=1.01$.
