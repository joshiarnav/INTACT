    "To find the smallest positive value of $m$ so that the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ has integral solutions, we can use the properties of quadratic equations.\n\nA quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ has integral solutions if and only if the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac$ is a perfect square.\n\nIn this case, the quadratic equation is $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$. The discriminant is $(-m)^2 - 4(10)(420) = m^2 - 16800$.\n\nFor the equation to have integral solutions, $m^2 - 16800$ must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square as $k^2$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nSo, we have $m^2 - 16800 = k^2$. Rearranging, we get $m^2 - k^2 = 16800$.\n\nFactoring the left-hand side as a difference of squares, we get $(m + k)(m - k) = 16800$.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest positive value of $m$ that satisfies this equation. To do this, we can find the factors of $16800$ and try to express them as $(m + k)$ and $(m - k)$.\n\nThe prime factorization of $16800$ is $2^5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$. We can try different combinations of these factors to find the smallest positive value of $m$.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, we find that $(m + k) = 120$ and $(m - k) = 140$ satisfy the equation, since $120 \\cdot 140 = 16800$.\n\nSolving these equations, we get $m = 130$ and $k = 10$. Since $m$ is positive, this is a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive value of $m$ so that the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ has integral solutions is $\\boxed{130}$.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{130}$",
    "To find the smallest positive value of $m$ so that the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ has integral solutions, we need to consider the properties of quadratic equations and their roots.\n\nA quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ has roots given by the quadratic formula:\n\\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\nFor the given equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$, $a = 10$, $b = -m$, and $c = 420$. Substituting these into the quadratic formula gives:\n\\[x = \\frac{m \\pm \\sqrt{(-m)^2 - 4 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 420}}{2 \\cdot 10}\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{m \\pm \\sqrt{m^2 - 16800}}{20}\\]\n\nFor the roots to be integers, $\\sqrt{m^2 - 16800}$ must be an integer, and when divided by 20, the entire fraction results in an integer. This implies that $m^2 - 16800$ must be a perfect square.\n\nLet's denote $\\sqrt{m^2 - 16800} = n$, where $n$ is an integer. Then:\n\\[m^2 - 16800 = n^2\\]\n\\[m^2 = n^2 + 16800\\]\n\nWe are looking for the smallest positive $m$ that satisfies this condition and also results in integral solutions for $x$. The smallest possible value for $n$ that would make $m$ positive and minimize it would be when $n^2$ is the smallest perfect square that, when added to 16800, results in another perfect square.\n\nHowever, to simplify the approach, let's consider the factorization of $420$ since the product of the roots of the quadratic equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ is $420/10 = 42$ (from Vieta's formulas, $c/a = 420/10 = 42$). For the roots to be integers, they must multiply to $42$. The pairs of integers that multiply to $42$ are:\n- $1$ and $42$\n- $2$ and $21$\n- $3$ and $14$\n- $6$ and $7$\n- And their negatives.\n\nSince $m$ must be positive and is related to the sum of the roots (from Vieta's formulas, $-b/a = m/10 = \\text{sum of the roots}$), we look for the pair of roots that would give the smallest positive sum, because $m = 10 \\times (\\text{sum of the roots})$.\n\nThe smallest positive sum comes from the pair $6$ and $7$ (or $-6$ and $-7$, but we are interested in the positive $m$), giving a sum of $13$. Thus, the smallest positive value of $m$ is:\n\\[m = 10 \\times 13 = 130\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{130}$",

  "solution": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the solutions the the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$. We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively, so $p+q = m/10$ and $pq = 420/10 = 42$. Since $m = 10(p+q)$, we minimize $m$ by minimizing the sum $p+q$. Since $p$ and $q$ are integers and multiply to 42, the possible values of $(p,q)$ are $(1,42),(2,21),(3,14),(6,7),(7,6),(14,3),(21,2),(42,1)$. (Note that if $p$ and $q$ are both negative, then $p+q$ is negative, so $m$ would be negative, which is excluded by the problem.) The sum $p+q$ is minimized when $(p,q) = (6,7)$ or $(7,6)$. In either case, $m = 10(p+q) = 10(6+7) = \\boxed{130}.$",
