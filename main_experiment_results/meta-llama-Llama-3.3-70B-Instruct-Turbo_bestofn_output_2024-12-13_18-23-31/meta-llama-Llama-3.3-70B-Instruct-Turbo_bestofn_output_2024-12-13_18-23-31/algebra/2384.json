    "## Step 1: Define the problem algebraically\nLet's denote the integer as $x$. According to the problem, the square of $x$ is 48 more than its double. This can be written as $x^2 = 2x + 48$.\n\n## Step 2: Rearrange the equation into a quadratic equation\nTo solve for $x$, we need to rearrange the equation into a standard quadratic form: $x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation\nWe can solve the quadratic equation $x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$ by factoring or using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -2$, and $c = -48$. Substituting these values into the formula gives $x = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-48)}}{2 \\cdot 1}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify and calculate the roots\nSimplifying the equation inside the square root first, we get $x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 192}}{2}$. This further simplifies to $x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{196}}{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{196} = 14$, the equation simplifies to $x = \\frac{2 \\pm 14}{2}$. This gives two possible values for $x$: $x = \\frac{2 + 14}{2} = 8$ and $x = \\frac{2 - 14}{2} = -6$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the least integer\nBetween the two solutions $x = 8$ and $x = -6$, the least integer is $-6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-6}$",
