    "## Step 1: Simplify the denominator\nFirst, let's simplify $\\sqrt[3]{16}$.

    "## Step 1: Simplify the radical in the denominator\nWe start by simplifying $\\sqrt[3]{16}$.

Since the cube of $3\\sqrt[3]{2}$ would give us $3^3 \\cdot 2 = 54 \\cdot 2 = 108$ in the denominator if we were multiplying by $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ twice more (because $(\\sqrt[3]{2})^3 = 2$), but we are looking to keep the denominator as simple as possible while still rationalizing it. However, we actually need to get rid of the cube root, and to do that, we can utilize the fact that $(\\sqrt[3]{2})^3 = 2$. Thus, we aim to get $\\sqrt[3]{4}$ in the denominator when multiplied out, as $\\sqrt[3]{4} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{2} = \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$ is not our goal here but rather to simplify the expression further.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the correct form to rationalize the denominator\nGiven that our goal is to simplify $\\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{2}}$, we realize the mistake in the thought process in Step 4. The correct approach to rationalize $\\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{2}}$ is to multiply both the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt[3]{4}$ because $\\sqrt[3]{2} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{4} = \\sqrt[3]{2 \\cdot 4} = \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$.\n\n## Step 6: Multiply the expression by the chosen form\nWe multiply the expression $\\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{2}}$ by $\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}$: $$\\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{\\sqrt[3]{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{3\\sqrt[3]{8}}$$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression\nSince $\\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$, we substitute this back into our expression: $$\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{3 \\cdot 2}$$.\n\n## Step 8: Final simplification\nSimplify the fraction: $$\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{6}$$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{6}}$"
