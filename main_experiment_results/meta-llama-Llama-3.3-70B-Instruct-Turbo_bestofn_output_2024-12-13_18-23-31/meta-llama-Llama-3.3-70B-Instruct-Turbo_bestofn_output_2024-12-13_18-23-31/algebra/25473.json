  "problem": "Joann rode her bike at an average speed of 12 miles per hour for three and a half hours. If her friend, Fran, rides for 3 hours, at what average speed, in miles per hour, would she have to ride her bike to travel the same distance that Joann traveled?",
  "all_solutions": [
    "## Step 1: Calculate the distance Joann traveled\nTo find the distance Joann traveled, we multiply her average speed by the time she rode her bike. Distance = speed * time = 12 miles/hour * 3.5 hours = 42 miles.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the speed Fran needs to travel the same distance in 3 hours\nSince Fran needs to travel the same distance (42 miles) in 3 hours, we divide the distance by the time to find the required average speed. Speed = distance / time = 42 miles / 3 hours = 14 miles per hour.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$",
    "## Step 1: Calculate the total distance Joann traveled\nTo calculate the distance Joann traveled, we need to multiply her average speed by the time she rode her bike. Distance = speed * time. For Joann, the distance is 12 miles/hour * 3.5 hours.\n\n## Step 2: Perform the multiplication to find Joann's distance\nJoann's distance = 12 * 3.5 = 42 miles.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the formula to find Fran's average speed\nSince Fran needs to travel the same distance in 3 hours, we use the formula Distance = speed * time, and solve for speed. Fran's speed = Distance / time.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Fran's required average speed\nFran's speed = 42 miles / 3 hours = 14 miles per hour.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$",
    "## Step 1: Calculate the distance Joann traveled.\nTo calculate the distance Joann traveled, we use the formula distance = speed * time. Given that Joann's speed was 12 miles per hour and she rode for 3.5 hours, we can calculate the distance as 12 * 3.5.\n\n## Step 2: Perform the multiplication to find the distance Joann traveled.\n12 * 3.5 = 42 miles. So, Joann traveled 42 miles.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the speed Fran needs to travel the same distance in 3 hours.\nTo find the speed Fran needs, we use the formula speed = distance / time. Given that Fran needs to travel 42 miles in 3 hours, we calculate her needed speed as 42 / 3.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the division to find Fran's needed speed.\n42 / 3 = 14 miles per hour. So, Fran needs to ride at an average speed of 14 miles per hour to travel the same distance as Joann in 3 hours.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$"
