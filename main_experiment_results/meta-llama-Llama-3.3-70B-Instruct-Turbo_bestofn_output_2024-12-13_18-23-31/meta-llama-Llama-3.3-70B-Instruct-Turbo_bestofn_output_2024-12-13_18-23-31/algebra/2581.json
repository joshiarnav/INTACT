    "## Step 1: Recognize the binomial square pattern\nTo be a square of a binomial, the quadratic expression $4x^2 + 14x + a$ must factor into $(2x + b)^2$, where $b$ is a constant.\n\n## Step 2: Expand the binomial square\nExpanding $(2x + b)^2$ gives $4x^2 + 4bx + b^2$. This must be equivalent to $4x^2 + 14x + a$.\n\n## Step 3: Match coefficients\nMatching the coefficients of the linear term in both expressions, we get $4bx = 14x$. This implies $4b = 14$, so $b = \\frac{14}{4} = \\frac{7}{2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Find $a$ using $b$\nSince $b^2 = a$, we substitute $b = \\frac{7}{2}$ to find $a$. Thus, $a = \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{49}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{49}{4}}$",

    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the properties of a perfect square binomial\nTo be a perfect square, the given trinomial $4x^2 + 14x + a$ must factor into the form $(2x + b)^2$, where $b$ is a constant. This is because the leading coefficient of $4x^2$ is $4$, which is the square of $2$.\n\n## Step 2: Expand the perfect square binomial\nExpanding $(2x + b)^2$ gives us $(2x + b)(2x + b) = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2$. For this to be equivalent to $4x^2 + 14x + a$, the linear term $4bx$ must equal $14x$, and the constant term $b^2$ must equal $a$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $b$ by comparing coefficients of the linear terms\nComparing $4bx$ to $14x$, we see that $4b = 14$. Solving for $b$ gives $b = \\frac{14}{4} = \\frac{7}{2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $a$ using the value of $b$\nSince $b^2 = a$, and we found $b = \\frac{7}{2}$, then $a = \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{49}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{49}{4}}$"

  "solution": "If $4x^2 + 14x + a$  is the square of a binomial, then the binomial has the form $2x +b$ for some number $b$, because $(2x)^2 = 4x^2$.  So, we compare $(2x+b)^2$ to $4x^2 + 14x + a$. Expanding $(2x+b)^2$ gives \\[(2x+b)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2(2x)(b) + b^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2.\\] Equating the linear term of this to the linear term of $4x^2+14x+a$, we have $4bx=14x$, so $b=\\frac{14}{4}=\\frac{7}{2}$. Squaring the binomial gives $\\left(2x+\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2=4x^2+14x+\\frac{49}{4}$. Therefore, $a=\\boxed{\\frac{49}{4}}$.",
