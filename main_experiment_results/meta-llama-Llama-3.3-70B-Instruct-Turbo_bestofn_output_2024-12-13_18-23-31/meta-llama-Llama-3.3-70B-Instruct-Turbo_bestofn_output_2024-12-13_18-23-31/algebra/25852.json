    "## Step 1: Write down the given equation\nThe equation given is $\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15}=x+2$.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the denominator\nWe can factor the denominator as $x^2+2x-15 = (x+5)(x-3)$.\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the equation with the factored denominator\nThe equation becomes $\\frac{4x-12}{(x+5)(x-3)}=x+2$.\n\n## Step 4: Factor the numerator\nWe can factor the numerator as $4x-12 = 4(x-3)$.\n\n## Step 5: Rewrite the equation with both numerator and denominator factored\nThe equation now is $\\frac{4(x-3)}{(x+5)(x-3)}=x+2$.\n\n## Step 6: Cancel out the common factor (x-3)\nWe can cancel out the $(x-3)$ from both the numerator and the denominator, but we must remember that $x \\neq 3$ because that would make the denominator zero. The equation simplifies to $\\frac{4}{x+5}=x+2$.\n\n## Step 7: Multiply both sides by (x+5) to clear the fraction\nThis gives $4 = (x+2)(x+5)$.\n\n## Step 8: Expand the right side of the equation\nExpanding the right side gives $4 = x^2 + 7x + 10$.\n\n## Step 9: Rearrange the equation into standard quadratic form\nRearranging the terms gives $x^2 + 7x + 6 = 0$.\n\n## Step 10: Factor the quadratic equation\nThe quadratic equation factors as $(x+1)(x+6) = 0$.\n\n## Step 11: Solve for x\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives $x+1=0$ or $x+6=0$, so $x=-1$ or $x=-6$.\n\n## Step 12: Identify p and q\nSince $p > q$, $p = -1$ and $q = -6$.\n\n## Step 13: Calculate p - q\nThe difference $p - q = -1 - (-6) = -1 + 6 = 5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

    "## Step 1: First, we need to simplify and solve the given equation to find the values of $p$ and $q$.\nWe start with the equation $\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15}=x+2$.

Thus, the equation becomes $\\frac{4(x-3)}{(x+5)(x-3)}=x+2$.\n\n## Step 3: Cancel out the common factor in the numerator and denominator.\nSince $(x-3)$ is present in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out, resulting in $\\frac{4}{x+5}=x+2$.
