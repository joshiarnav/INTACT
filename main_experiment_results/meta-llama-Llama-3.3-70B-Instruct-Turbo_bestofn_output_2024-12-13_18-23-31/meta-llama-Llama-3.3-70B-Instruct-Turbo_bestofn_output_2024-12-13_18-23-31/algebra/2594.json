    "## Step 1: Recall the formula for a geometric sequence\nThe formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is $a_n = a_1 * r^{(n-1)}$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the term number.\n\n## Step 2: Use the given terms to set up equations\nGiven the third term $a_3 = 12$ and the fourth term $a_4 = 16$, we can set up the following equations using the geometric sequence formula:\n$a_3 = a_1 * r^{(3-1)} = a_1 * r^2 = 12$\n$a_4 = a_1 * r^{(4-1)} = a_1 * r^3 = 16$\n\n## Step 3: Solve for the common ratio $r$\nDividing the equation for $a_4$ by the equation for $a_3$ gives:\n$\\frac{a_1 * r^3}{a_1 * r^2} = \\frac{16}{12}$\nThis simplifies to $r = \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$\n\n## Step 4: Solve for the first term $a_1$\nSubstitute $r = \\frac{4}{3}$ into one of the original equations to solve for $a_1$. Using $a_1 * r^2 = 12$:\n$a_1 * (\\frac{4}{3})^2 = 12$\n$a_1 * \\frac{16}{9} = 12$\n$a_1 = \\frac{12 * 9}{16}$\n$a_1 = \\frac{108}{16}$\n$a_1 = \\frac{27}{4}$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$",

    "To find the first term of a geometric sequence given the third and fourth terms, we need to understand the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence, which is \\(a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{(n-1)}\\), where \\(a_n\\) is the nth term, \\(a_1\\) is the first term, and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\nGiven:\n- The third term (\\(a_3\\)) is 12.\n- The fourth term (\\(a_4\\)) is 16.\n\nStep 1: Find the common ratio (\\(r\\)).\nThe common ratio can be found by dividing the fourth term by the third term, since in a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by \\(r\\).

  "solution": "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence. Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$. Solving, we have $a\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",
