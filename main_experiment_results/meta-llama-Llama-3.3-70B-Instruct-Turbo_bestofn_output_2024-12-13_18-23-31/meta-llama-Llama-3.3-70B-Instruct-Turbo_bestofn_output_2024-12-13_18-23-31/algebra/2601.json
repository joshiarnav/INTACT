    "## Step 1: Understand the given inequality and its conditions\nThe given inequality is $x\\cdot(3x+1)<c$, and it holds if and only if $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$. This means the inequality is true for all $x$ in the interval $\\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$ and false for all $x$ outside this interval.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the inequality at the endpoints of the interval\nTo find the value of $c$, we need to consider what happens at the endpoints of the given interval, $x = -\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x = 2$. At these points, the inequality becomes an equality, because the inequality is strict (<) and the interval is open, meaning the endpoints themselves are not included in the solution set where the inequality is true.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the expression at $x = -\\frac{7}{3}$\nSubstitute $x = -\\frac{7}{3}$ into the expression $x\\cdot(3x+1)$ to get:\n\\[\n\\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right)\\cdot\\left(3\\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right)+1\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right)\\cdot\\left(-7+1\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right)\\cdot(-6) = 14\n\\]\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the expression at $x = 2$\nSubstitute $x = 2$ into the expression $x\\cdot(3x+1)$ to get:\n\\[\n2\\cdot(3\\cdot2+1) = 2\\cdot(6+1) = 2\\cdot7 = 14\n\\]\n\n## Step 5: Determine the value of $c$\nSince both endpoints yield the same value when substituted into the expression, and given that the inequality holds true for all $x$ within the interval and not true outside of it, the value of $c$ must be equal to this common value. Thus, $c$ equals the result obtained from either endpoint calculation.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given inequality and its conditions\nThe given inequality is $x\\cdot(3x+1)<c$, and it holds if and only if $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$. This means the inequality is true for all values of $x$ between $-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $2$, but not true for $x$ outside this interval.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the behavior of the quadratic function\nThe expression $x\\cdot(3x+1)$ simplifies to $3x^2 + x$, which is a quadratic function. This function represents a parabola that opens upwards because the coefficient of $x^2$ (which is 3) is positive.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the critical points of the inequality\nGiven that the inequality holds for $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$, the critical points are $x = -\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x = 2$. At these points, the inequality becomes an equality, which gives us $3x^2 + x = c$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $c$ using the critical points\nWe can substitute either $x = -\\frac{7}{3}$ or $x = 2$ into the equation $3x^2 + x = c$ to find $c$.\n\nFor $x = -\\frac{7}{3}$:\n\\[3\\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right) = c\\]\n\\[3\\left(\\frac{49}{9}\\right) - \\frac{7}{3} = c\\]\n\\[\\frac{49}{3} - \\frac{7}{3} = c\\]\n\\[\\frac{42}{3} = c\\]\n\\[14 = c\\]\n\nFor $x = 2$:\n\\[3(2)^2 + 2 = c\\]\n\\[3(4) + 2 = c\\]\n\\[12 + 2 = c\\]\n\\[14 = c\\]\n\nBoth critical points yield the same value for $c$, confirming the consistency of the solution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given inequality and its conditions\nThe given inequality is $x\\cdot(3x+1)<c$, and it holds if and only if $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$. This means the inequality is true for all values of $x$ between $-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $2$, exclusive of the endpoints.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the behavior of the quadratic function\nThe expression $x\\cdot(3x+1)$ simplifies to $3x^2 + x$. This is a quadratic function that opens upwards because the coefficient of $x^2$ (which is $3$) is positive. Therefore, its minimum value occurs at its vertex.\n\n## Step 3: Find the vertex of the quadratic function\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola given by $ax^2 + bx + c$ can be found using the formula $-\\frac{b}{2a}$. For $3x^2 + x$, $a = 3$ and $b = 1$. So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is $-\\frac{1}{2\\cdot3} = -\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the critical points\nHowever, since the inequality holds if and only if $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$, the critical points for our consideration are $-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $2$, not necessarily the vertex.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the quadratic at the endpoints of the interval\nTo find $c$, we need to evaluate $3x^2 + x$ at $x = -\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x = 2$ because $c$ must be greater than the values of the function at these points for the inequality to hold within the given interval.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the value of the function at $x = -\\frac{7}{3}$\nSubstitute $x = -\\frac{7}{3}$ into $3x^2 + x$:\n$3\\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right) = 3\\left(\\frac{49}{9}\\right) - \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{49}{3} - \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{42}{3} = 14$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the value of the function at $x = 2$\nSubstitute $x = 2$ into $3x^2 + x$:\n$3(2)^2 + 2 = 3\\cdot4 + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14$.\n\n## Step 8: Determine $c$ based on the calculations\nBoth calculations yield the same value, which means $c$ must be greater than $14$ for the inequality to hold true within the specified interval. However, since the question asks for the value of $c$ such that the inequality holds if and only if $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$, $c$ should be exactly the value that the function reaches at the endpoints, making the inequality true for $x$ within the interval and not true for $x$ outside it.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$"

  "solution": "When $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$, we have $x\\cdot(3x+1)-c<0$. This means that $x(3x+1)-c=0$ at $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x=2$. We now know that $x(3x+1)-c=0$ is a quadratic equation with roots at $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x=2$, and we want to use these roots to find a quadratic of the same form as the problem.  $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ gives us $(3x+7)=0$ and $x=2$ gives us $(x-2)=0$. \\begin{align*}\nx(3x+1)-c&=(3x+7)(x-2)\\\\\n&=3x^2+x-14\\\\\n&=x(3x+1)-14.\n\\end{align*} So, $c=\\boxed{14}$.",
