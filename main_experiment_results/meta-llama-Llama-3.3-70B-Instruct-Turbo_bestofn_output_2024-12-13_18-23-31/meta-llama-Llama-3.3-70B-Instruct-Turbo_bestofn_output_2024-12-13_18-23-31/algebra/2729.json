    "## Step 1: Expand the equation\nWe start by expanding the given equation $(2b+5)(b-1)=6b$ to solve for $b$. The expanded form is $2b^2 + 5b - 2b - 5 = 6b$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation gives $2b^2 + 3b - 5 = 6b$.\n\n## Step 3: Move all terms to one side\nWe then move all terms to one side to set the equation to 0: $2b^2 + 3b - 5 - 6b = 0$, which simplifies to $2b^2 - 3b - 5 = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the quadratic equation\nTo solve the quadratic equation $2b^2 - 3b - 5 = 0$, we can use the quadratic formula $b = \\frac{-c \\pm \\sqrt{c^2 - 4ad}}{2a}$, where $a = 2$, $c = -3$, and $d = -5$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the quadratic formula\nPlugging the values into the quadratic formula gives $b = \\frac{-(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(2)(-5)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 40}}{4} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}{4}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the solutions\nSimplifying the solutions gives $b = \\frac{3 \\pm 7}{4}$. This results in two possible values for $b$: $b = \\frac{3 + 7}{4} = \\frac{10}{4} = \\frac{5}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{3 - 7}{4} = \\frac{-4}{4} = -1$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the largest possible value of $b$\nThe largest possible value of $b$ is $\\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$",
    "## Step 1: Expand the equation\nFirst, we need to expand the given equation: $(2b+5)(b-1)=6b.$ This means we apply the distributive property (also known as FOIL for binomials) to the left side of the equation. The expansion results in $2b^2 - 2b + 5b - 5 = 6b.$\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the equation\nNow, simplify the equation by combining like terms: $2b^2 + 3b - 5 = 6b.$\n\n## Step 3: Move all terms to one side\nTo solve for $b$, we need to get all terms on one side of the equation. So, we subtract $6b$ from both sides to get $2b^2 - 3b - 5 = 0.$\n\n## Step 4: Solve the quadratic equation\nWe now have a quadratic equation in the form of $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a = 2$, $b = -3$, and $c = -5$. We can solve this equation for $b$ using the quadratic formula: $b = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Substituting the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the formula gives $b = \\frac{-(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(2)(-5)}}{2(2)}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the quadratic formula\nSimplify the equation inside the square root: $b = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 40}}{4}$. This further simplifies to $b = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}{4}$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $b$\nSince $\\sqrt{49} = 7$, we have $b = \\frac{3 \\pm 7}{4}$. This gives us two possible values for $b$: $b = \\frac{3 + 7}{4} = \\frac{10}{4} = \\frac{5}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{3 - 7}{4} = \\frac{-4}{4} = -1$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the largest possible value of $b$\nWe need to find the largest possible value of $b$ from the solutions obtained. Comparing $\\frac{5}{2}$ and $-1$, it's clear that $\\frac{5}{2}$ is the larger value.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$",
