    "## Step 1: Recall the definition of logarithm\nThe logarithm $\\log_ba = c$ is defined as $b^c = a$. In this case, we need to find $x$ such that $8^x = 2$.\n\n## Step 2: Rewrite 8 as a power of 2\n$8 = 2^3$, so we can rewrite the equation as $(2^3)^x = 2$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply exponent rule\nUsing the rule $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$, we simplify the equation to $2^{3x} = 2$.\n\n## Step 4: Equate the exponents\nSince the bases are the same, we equate the exponents: $3x = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for x\nDividing both sides of the equation by 3, we find $x = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the properties of logarithms\nWe need to evaluate $\\log_82$, which is asking \"to what power must 8 be raised, to get 2?\" This can be solved using the properties of logarithms.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the change of base formula\nThe change of base formula for logarithms states that $\\log_ab = \\frac{\\log_cb}{\\log_ca}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive numbers and $c \\neq 1$. However, to solve this problem, we can also consider the properties of the numbers involved, specifically looking for a relationship between 8 and 2 that can help us simplify the expression.\n\n## Step 3: Identify a relationship between 8 and 2\nNotice that $8 = 2^3$. This relationship can help us express $\\log_82$ in a simpler form because it directly relates the base (8) to the result (2) through an exponent.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the logarithmic identity\nGiven $8 = 2^3$, we want to find $x$ such that $8^x = 2$. Substituting $8$ with $2^3$, we get $(2^3)^x = 2$. Using the property of exponents $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$, we simplify this to $2^{3x} = 2^1$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for x\nTo find $x$, we equate the exponents: $3x = 1$.

This formula allows us to change the base of a logarithm to a more convenient one.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the change of base formula to the given problem\nUsing the change of base formula, we can rewrite $\\log_82$ as $\\frac{\\log 2}{\\log 8}$. Here, we choose the common logarithm (base 10) as our new base for simplicity, but any base will work.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the denominator using logarithm properties\nWe know that $8 = 2^3$. Using the property of logarithms that $\\log_ab^c = c \\log_ab$, we can simplify $\\log 8$ to $\\log 2^3 = 3\\log 2$.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute the simplified denominator back into the fraction\nSubstituting $3\\log 2$ for $\\log 8$, our fraction becomes $\\frac{\\log 2}{3\\log 2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the fraction\nThe $\\log 2$ in the numerator and the denominator cancel out, leaving us with $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$"
