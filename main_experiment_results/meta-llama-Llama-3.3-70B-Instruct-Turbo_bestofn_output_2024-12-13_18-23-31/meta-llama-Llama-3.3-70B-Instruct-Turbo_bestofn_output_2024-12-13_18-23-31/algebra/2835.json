    "## Step 1: Determine the coordinates of point E\nSince E is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$, its coordinates can be calculated by averaging the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of B and C. Therefore, the coordinates of E are $((0+8)/2, (0+0)/2) = (4, 0)$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the coordinates of point D\nSince D is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, its coordinates can be calculated by averaging the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of A and B. Therefore, the coordinates of D are $((0+0)/2, (6+0)/2) = (0, 3)$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the equation of the line passing through points A and E\nTo find the equation of the line passing through points A and E, we need to calculate the slope of the line. The slope is given by $\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{6-0}{0-4} = -\\frac{3}{2}$. The equation of the line in slope-intercept form is $y = -\\frac{3}{2}x + b$. We can substitute the coordinates of point A into this equation to solve for b: $6 = -\\frac{3}{2}(0) + b \\implies b = 6$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = -\\frac{3}{2}x + 6$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the equation of the line passing through points C and D\nTo find the equation of the line passing through points C and D, we need to calculate the slope of the line. The slope is given by $\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{3-0}{0-8} = -\\frac{3}{8}$. The equation of the line in slope-intercept form is $y = -\\frac{3}{8}x + b$. We can substitute the coordinates of point C into this equation to solve for b: $0 = -\\frac{3}{8}(8) + b \\implies b = 3$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = -\\frac{3}{8}x + 3$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the point of intersection of the two lines\nTo find the point of intersection F, we need to solve the system of equations:\n$y = -\\frac{3}{2}x + 6$ and $y = -\\frac{3}{8}x + 3$.\nWe can set these two equations equal to each other and solve for x:\n$-\\frac{3}{2}x + 6 = -\\frac{3}{8}x + 3 \\implies -\\frac{3}{2}x + \\frac{3}{8}x = 3 - 6 \\implies -\\frac{12}{8}x + \\frac{3}{8}x = -3 \\implies -\\frac{9}{8}x = -3 \\implies x = \\frac{8}{3}$.\nThen substitute this x-value into one of the equations to solve for y:\n$y = -\\frac{3}{2}(\\frac{8}{3}) + 6 \\implies y = -4 + 6 \\implies y = 2$.\nTherefore, the coordinates of point F are $(\\frac{8}{3}, 2)$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the sum of the x and y coordinates of point F\nThe sum of the x and y coordinates of point F is $\\frac{8}{3} + 2 = \\frac{8}{3} + \\frac{6}{3} = \\frac{14}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{14}{3}}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the coordinates of point E\nSince E is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$, we can find its coordinates by taking the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of points B and C. The x-coordinate of E is $\\frac{0+8}{2} = 4$, and the y-coordinate of E is $\\frac{0+0}{2} = 0$. So, the coordinates of point E are (4, 0).\n\n## Step 2: Determine the coordinates of point D\nSince D is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, we can find its coordinates by taking the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of points A and B. The x-coordinate of D is $\\frac{0+0}{2} = 0$, and the y-coordinate of D is $\\frac{6+0}{2} = 3$. So, the coordinates of point D are (0, 3).\n\n## Step 3: Find the equation of the line passing through points A and E\nTo find the equation of the line, we need the slope and the y-intercept. The slope of the line passing through points A(0, 6) and E(4, 0) can be found using the formula $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Substituting the values, we get $m = \\frac{0 - 6}{4 - 0} = \\frac{-6}{4} = -\\frac{3}{2}$. The y-intercept is the y-coordinate of point A, which is 6. So, the equation of the line is $y = -\\frac{3}{2}x + 6$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the equation of the line passing through points C and D\nTo find the equation of the line, we need the slope and the y-intercept. The slope of the line passing through points C(8, 0) and D(0, 3) can be found using the formula $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Substituting the values, we get $m = \\frac{3 - 0}{0 - 8} = \\frac{3}{-8} = -\\frac{3}{8}$. The y-intercept is the y-coordinate of point D, which is 3. So, the equation of the line is $y = -\\frac{3}{8}x + 3$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the point of intersection of the two lines\nTo find the point of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations:\n$y = -\\frac{3}{2}x + 6$ and $y = -\\frac{3}{8}x + 3$.\nWe can equate the two equations and solve for x:\n$-\\frac{3}{2}x + 6 = -\\frac{3}{8}x + 3$.\nMultiplying the entire equation by 8 to get rid of the fractions, we get:\n$-12x + 48 = -3x + 24$.\nNow, we can solve for x:\n$-12x + 3x = 24 - 48$.\n$-9x = -24$.\n$x = \\frac{-24}{-9}$.\n$x = \\frac{8}{3}$.\nNow that we have the x-coordinate, we can substitute it into one of the equations to find the y-coordinate:\n$y = -\\frac{3}{2}(\\frac{8}{3}) + 6$.\n$y = -\\frac{8}{2} + 6$.\n$y = -4 + 6$.\n$y = 2$.\nSo, the coordinates of point F are $(\\frac{8}{3}, 2)$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the sum of the x and y coordinates of point F\nThe sum of the x and y coordinates of point F is $\\frac{8}{3} + 2$.\n$\\frac{8}{3} + 2 = \\frac{8}{3} + \\frac{6}{3}$.\n$\\frac{8}{3} + \\frac{6}{3} = \\frac{14}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{14}{3}}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the coordinates of point E\nTo find the coordinates of point E, we need to find the midpoint of segment BC. The midpoint formula is given by: ( (x1+x2)/2 , (y1+y2)/2 ). For points B(0,0) and C(8,0), the coordinates of E will be: ( (0+8)/2 , (0+0)/2 ) = (4, 0).\n\n## Step 2: Determine the coordinates of point D\nTo find the coordinates of point D, we need to find the midpoint of segment AB. The midpoint formula is given by: ( (x1+x2)/2 , (y1+y2)/2 ). For points A(0,6) and B(0,0), the coordinates of D will be: ( (0+0)/2 , (6+0)/2 ) = (0, 3).\n\n## Step 3: Find the equation of line AE\nTo find the equation of line AE, we need to find the slope of the line first. The slope formula is given by: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). For points A(0,6) and E(4,0), the slope will be: m = (0 - 6) / (4 - 0) = -6/4 = -3/2. Now we can use the point-slope form of a line: y - y1 = m(x - x1). Using point A(0,6), we get: y - 6 = (-3/2)(x - 0).\n\n## Step 4: Find the equation of line CD\nTo find the equation of line CD, we need to find the slope of the line first. The slope formula is given by: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). For points C(8,0) and D(0,3), the slope will be: m = (3 - 0) / (0 - 8) = 3/-8 = -3/8. Now we can use the point-slope form of a line: y - y1 = m(x - x1). Using point C(8,0), we get: y - 0 = (-3/8)(x - 8).\n\n## Step 5: Solve the equations of lines AE and CD to find the coordinates of point F\nWe have the equations of lines AE and CD. To find the coordinates of point F, we need to solve these equations simultaneously. The equation of line AE is y - 6 = (-3/2)(x - 0) and the equation of line CD is y - 0 = (-3/8)(x - 8). We can rewrite these equations as y = (-3/2)x + 6 and y = (-3/8)x + 3. Setting these two equations equal to each other, we get: (-3/2)x + 6 = (-3/8)x + 3.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for x\nMultiplying the entire equation by 8 to eliminate the fractions, we get: -12x + 48 = -3x + 24. Now, let's solve for x: -12x + 3x = 24 - 48, -9x = -24, x = -24/-9, x = 8/3.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for y\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into one of the equations to find the value of y. Using the equation y = (-3/2)x + 6, we get: y = (-3/2)(8/3) + 6, y = -4 + 6, y = 2.\n\n## Step 8: Find the sum of the x and y coordinates of point F\nThe sum of the x and y coordinates of point F is 8/3 + 2. To add these numbers, we need to get a common denominator: 8/3 + 6/3 = 14/3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{14}{3}}$"
