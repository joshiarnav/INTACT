  "problem": "The Cookie Monster encounters a cookie whose boundary is the equation $x^2+y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3 y$ and is very confused. He wants to know if this cookie is a lunch-sized cookie or a snack-sized cookie. What is the radius of this cookie?",

    "## Step 1: Rearrange the equation to standard form\nTo find the radius of the cookie, we need to rearrange the given equation into the standard form of a circle, which is $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius. The given equation is $x^2 + y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3y$. First, let's move all terms to one side to get $x^2 + y^2 - x - 3y - 6.5 = 0$.\n\n## Step 2: Complete the square for both x and y\nTo complete the square for $x$, we add $(\\frac{-1}{2})^2 = 0.25$ to both sides. For $y$, we add $(\\frac{-3}{2})^2 = 2.25$ to both sides. The equation becomes $x^2 - x + 0.25 + y^2 - 3y + 2.25 = 6.5 + 0.25 + 2.25$. This simplifies to $(x - 0.5)^2 + (y - 1.5)^2 = 9$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the radius\nFrom the standard form of the circle equation $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we can see that $r^2 = 9$. Therefore, the radius $r$ of the circle (or the cookie) is the square root of 9, which is 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

  "solution": "The equation $x^2+y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3 y$ can be rewritten as $x^2-x+y^2-3y=6.5$.
