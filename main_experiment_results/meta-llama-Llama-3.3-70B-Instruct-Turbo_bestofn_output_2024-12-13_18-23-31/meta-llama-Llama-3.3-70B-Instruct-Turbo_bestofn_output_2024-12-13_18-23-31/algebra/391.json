    "## Step 1: To find the value of $\\left[f^{-1}(2)\\right]^{-2}$, we first need to find $f^{-1}(2)$.\nTo do this, we'll start by finding the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ of the given function $f(x)=\\frac{16}{5+3x}$.\n\n## Step 2: Let's denote $y = f(x) = \\frac{16}{5+3x}$ and solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ to find the inverse function.\nWe have $y = \\frac{16}{5+3x}$. Multiply both sides by $(5+3x)$ to get $y(5+3x) = 16$.\n\n## Step 3: Expand and solve for $x$.\n$5y + 3yx = 16$. Subtract $5y$ from both sides to get $3yx = 16 - 5y$. Then divide by $3y$ to isolate $x$: $x = \\frac{16 - 5y}{3y}$.\n\n## Step 4: Replace $y$ with $x$ to express the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$.\nThe inverse function is $f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{16 - 5x}{3x}$.\n\n## Step 5: Now, we need to find $f^{-1}(2)$ by substituting $x = 2$ into the inverse function.\n$f^{-1}(2) = \\frac{16 - 5(2)}{3(2)} = \\frac{16 - 10}{6} = \\frac{6}{6} = 1$.\n\n## Step 6: Finally, we calculate $\\left[f^{-1}(2)\\right]^{-2}$.\n$\\left[f^{-1}(2)\\right]^{-2} = (1)^{-2} = 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
