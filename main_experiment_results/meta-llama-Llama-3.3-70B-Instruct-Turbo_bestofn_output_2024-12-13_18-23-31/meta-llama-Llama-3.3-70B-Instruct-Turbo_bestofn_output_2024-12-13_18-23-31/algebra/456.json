The first term $a_1$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$, and the common ratio $r$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$ since each term is half the preceding term.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric sequence.\nThe sum $S_n$ of the first $n$ terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula $S_n = \\frac{a_1(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the given values into the formula.\nGiven that $a_1 = \\frac{1}{4}$, $r = \\frac{1}{2}$, and $S_n = \\frac{63}{128}$, we substitute these values into the formula: $\\frac{63}{128} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}(1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n)}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation.\nSimplifying the denominator of the right side gives $1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. The equation simplifies to $\\frac{63}{128} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}(1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n)}{\\frac{1}{2}}$. Further simplification yields $\\frac{63}{128} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}(1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n)$, which simplifies to $\\frac{63}{128} = \\frac{1}{8}(1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n)$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $n$.\nMultiplying both sides by $8$ to clear the fraction gives $8 \\cdot \\frac{63}{128} = 1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n$. Simplifying the left side yields $\\frac{63}{16} = 1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n$. To isolate $(\\frac{1}{2})^n$, we rearrange the equation: $(\\frac{1}{2})^n = 1 - \\frac{63}{16}$. Simplifying the right side gives $(\\frac{1}{2})^n = \\frac{16 - 63}{16} = -\\frac{47}{16}$. However, this step contains a mistake in calculation. Let's correct that and follow the proper steps to solve for $n$.\n\n## Step 6: Correct the mistake and properly solve for $n$.\nThe correct step after simplification should involve directly addressing the equation $\\frac{63}{128} = \\frac{1}{8}(1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n)$. Multiplying both sides by $8$ yields $\\frac{63}{16} = 1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n$. Then, correctly rearranging and solving for $(\\frac{1}{2})^n$ gives $(\\frac{1}{2})^n = 1 - \\frac{63}{16}$. However, the error was in the calculation and interpretation. The correct calculation should be: $\\frac{63}{128} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n)$. Simplifying correctly: $\\frac{63}{128} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2})^n$. This simplifies further to $\\frac{63}{128} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2})^n$. To solve for $n$, let's correct the approach entirely.\n\n## Step 7: Correct approach to solve for $n$.\nStarting again from the correct formula $S_n = \\frac{a_1(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}$, and given $S_n = \\frac{63}{128}$, $a_1 = \\frac{1}{4}$, and $r = \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $\\frac{63}{128} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}(1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n)}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}}$. Simplifying, $\\frac{63}{128} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}(1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n)}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}(1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n) = \\frac{1}{8}(1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n)$. Multiplying both sides by $8$ gives $8 \\cdot \\frac{63}{128} = 1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n$. Thus, $\\frac{63}{16} = 1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n$. Rearranging, $(\\frac{1}{2})^n = 1 - \\frac{63}{16}$. This step was incorrectly approached. The right approach should directly tackle the equation without the mistake.\n\n## Step 8: Properly rearrange and solve the equation for $n$.\nGiven $\\frac{63}{128} = \\frac{1}{8}(1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n)$, multiplying by $8$ yields $\\frac{63}{16} = 1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n$. The correct rearrangement is $1 - \\frac{63}{16} = (\\frac{1}{2})^n$. Thus, $(\\frac{1}{2})^n = 1 - \\frac{63}{16} = \\frac{16 - 63}{16} = -\\frac{47}{16}$. This calculation is incorrect due to a mistake in the simplification process. Let's correct this and directly solve for $n$ with the proper approach.\n\n## Step 9: Correct calculation for solving $n$.\nCorrectly, from $\\frac{63}{128} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}}$, simplifying yields $\\frac{63}{128} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n)$. Therefore, $\\frac{63}{64} = 1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n$. Solving for $(\\frac{1}{2})^n$ gives $(\\frac{1}{2})^n = 1 - \\frac{63}{64} = \\frac{64 - 63}{64} = \\frac{1}{64} = (\\frac{1}{2})^6$. This implies $n = 6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
