    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given the expression $|6x^2-47x+15|$ and asked to find the greatest integer $x$ for which this expression is prime.\n\n## Step 2: Factorize the quadratic expression\nThe given quadratic expression $6x^2-47x+15$ can be factorized to $(2x-15)(3x-1)$.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the absolute value\nGiven the absolute value $|6x^2-47x+15|$, we can express it as $|(2x-15)(3x-1)|$. For this expression to be prime, its only divisors must be $1$ and itself.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the conditions for the expression to be prime\nTo ensure the expression is prime, one of the factors $|2x-15|$ or $|3x-1|$ must be equal to $1$, since the product of two numbers greater than $1$ cannot be prime.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $x$ when $|3x-1|=1$\nSolving the equation $|3x-1|=1$, we get two cases: $3x-1=1$ and $3x-1=-1$. Solving these, we find $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $x=0$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $x$ when $|2x-15|=1$\nSolving the equation $|2x-15|=1$, we get two cases: $2x-15=1$ and $2x-15=-1$. Solving these, we find $x=8$ and $x=7$.\n\n## Step 7: Check the validity of the solutions\nAmong the solutions $x=\\frac{2}{3}$, $x=0$, $x=8$, and $x=7$, we need to find the greatest integer $x$. Since $\\frac{2}{3}$ is not an integer, it is not a valid solution for this problem.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the greatest integer $x$\nComparing the integer solutions $x=0$, $x=8$, and $x=7$, the greatest integer $x$ is $8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nWe are given the expression $|6x^2-47x+15|$ and asked to find the greatest integer $x$ for which this expression is prime.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the quadratic expression\nTo simplify the expression, let's factor the quadratic $6x^2-47x+15$. Factoring gives $(2x-15)(3x-1)$.\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the expression with the factored quadratic\nSubstituting the factored form into the original expression gives $|(2x-15)(3x-1)|$.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the properties of prime numbers\nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For $|(2x-15)(3x-1)|$ to be prime, its only divisors must be 1 and itself.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the absolute value expression\nGiven $|(2x-15)(3x-1)|$, if either $(2x-15)$ or $(3x-1)$ is equal to 1 or -1, then the absolute value of the product could potentially be a prime number, because one of the factors would be 1 (or -1, which doesn't change the absolute value), leaving the other factor to be a prime number.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for x when (2x-15) = 1 or -1\nSetting $(2x-15) = 1$ gives $2x = 16$, hence $x = 8$. Setting $(2x-15) = -1$ gives $2x = 14$, hence $x = 7$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for x when (3x-1) = 1 or -1\nSetting $(3x-1) = 1$ gives $3x = 2$, hence $x = \\frac{2}{3}$. Setting $(3x-1) = -1$ gives $3x = 0$, hence $x = 0$.\n\n## Step 8: Check which solutions yield a prime number\nWe check $x = 8$ and $x = 7$ because they are the integer solutions from step 6. For $x = 8$, $|(2*8-15)(3*8-1)| = |(1)(23)| = 23$, which is prime. For $x = 7$, $|(2*7-15)(3*7-1)| = |(-1)(20)| = 20$, which is not prime.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the greatest integer x that yields a prime number\nFrom step 8, $x = 8$ yields a prime number.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",

  "solution": "We can factor the quadratic $6x^2-47x+15$ as $(2x-15)(3x-1)$. So we have $|6x^2-47x+15|=|(2x-15)(3x-1)|=|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|$. In order for $|6x^2-47x+15|$ to be prime, its only divisors must be $1$ and itself. Thus one of $|2x-15|$ or $|3x-1|$ must be equal to $1$.\n\nIf $|3x-1|=1$, then $3x-1=1$ or $3x-1=-1$. These equations yield $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $x=0$, respectively. We throw out $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ since it is not an integer, and keep $x=0$ as a candidate.\n\nIf $|2x-15|=1$, then $2x-15=1$, in which case $2x=16$ and $x=8$, or $2x-15=-1$, in which case $2x=14$ and $x=7$.\n\nThus our candidates for the greatest $x$ are $0, 7$, and $8$. It remains to check whether the other factor is prime. We first check $x=8$. Since $|2x-15|=1$, we know $|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|=|3x-1|=|24-1|=23$, which is prime. Thus $\\boxed{8}$ is the largest integer for which $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime.",
