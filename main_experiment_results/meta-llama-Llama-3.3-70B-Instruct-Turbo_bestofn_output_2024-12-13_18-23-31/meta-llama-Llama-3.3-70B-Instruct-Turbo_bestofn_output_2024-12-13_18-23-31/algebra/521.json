    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the given equation\nWe are given the equation $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{18}$ and we need to find the smallest possible value for $x + y$ where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers and $x \\neq y$.\n\n## Step 2: Manipulate the equation to find an expression for $x + y$\nTo start solving the problem, let's first manipulate the given equation to simplify and eventually find an expression that involves $x + y$. Multiply both sides of the equation by $18xy$ to eliminate the fractions: $18xy(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y}) = 18xy(\\frac{1}{18})$. This simplifies to $18y + 18x = xy$.\n\n## Step 3: Rearrange the equation to solve for $x + y$\nRearranging the terms in the equation $18y + 18x = xy$ gives us $xy - 18x - 18y = 0$. To make it easier to factor, we can add $18^2$ to both sides of the equation, resulting in $xy - 18x - 18y + 18^2 = 18^2$. This can be rewritten as $(x - 18)(y - 18) = 18^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the factor pairs of $18^2$\nSince $18^2 = 324$, we need to find the factor pairs of $324$. The factor pairs are: $(1, 324), (2, 162), (3, 108), (4, 81), (6, 54), (9, 36), (12, 27), (18, 18)$. However, since $x$ and $y$ must be different, we exclude the pair $(18, 18)$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $x + y$ for each factor pair\nFor each factor pair $(a, b)$ where $a \\leq b$, we calculate $x$ and $y$ as $x = a + 18$ and $y = b + 18$, and then find $x + y$. The pairs to consider are: $(1, 324), (2, 162), (3, 108), (4, 81), (6, 54), (9, 36), (12, 27)$.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the smallest $x + y$\nCalculating $x + y$ for each pair:\n- For $(1, 324)$, $x = 19$, $y = 342$, $x + y = 361$.\n- For $(2, 162)$, $x = 20$, $y = 180$, $x + y = 200$.\n- For $(3, 108)$, $x = 21$, $y = 126$, $x + y = 147$.\n- For $(4, 81)$, $x = 22$, $y = 99$, $x + y = 121$.\n- For $(6, 54)$, $x = 24$, $y = 72$, $x + y = 96$.\n- For $(9, 36)$, $x = 27$, $y = 54$, $x + y = 81$.\n- For $(12, 27)$, $x = 30$, $y = 45$, $x + y = 75$.\nThe smallest $x + y$ is $75$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{75}$",
    "## Step 1: Multiply both sides of the equation by $18xy$ to eliminate the fractions\nMultiplying both sides of the equation $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{18}$ by $18xy$ gives $18y + 18x = xy$.\n\n## Step 2: Rearrange the equation to solve for $xy$\nRearranging the equation gives $xy - 18x - 18y = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick by adding $18^2$ to both sides\nAdding $18^2$ to both sides gives $xy - 18x - 18y + 18^2 = 18^2$, which can be factored into $(x - 18)(y - 18) = 18^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the factor pairs of $18^2$\n$18^2 = 324$, and the factor pairs of $324$ are $(1, 324), (2, 162), (3, 108), (4, 81), (6, 54), (9, 36), (12, 27), (18, 18)$.\n\n## Step 5: Since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers and $x \\neq y$, find the pair of factors that gives the smallest $x + y$\nTo minimize $x + y$, we need to find the pair of factors of $324$ that are closest in value, because $x = 18 + \\text{factor 1}$ and $y = 18 + \\text{factor 2}$.

    "## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the constraint\nThe given equation is $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{18}$, where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers and $x \\neq y$. This equation needs to be rearranged to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$.\n\n## Step 2: Rearrange the given equation\nTo find the relationship between $x$ and $y$, we first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side: $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{y + x}{xy}$. Setting this equal to $\\frac{1}{18}$ gives $\\frac{y + x}{xy} = \\frac{1}{18}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation\nMultiplying both sides by $18xy$ to clear the denominators gives $18(y + x) = xy$. This simplifies to $18x + 18y = xy$.\n\n## Step 4: Rearrange the equation to solve for one variable in terms of the other\nRearranging the equation to solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ (or vice versa) gives $xy - 18y = 18x$. Factoring out $y$ yields $y(x - 18) = 18x$.\n\n## Step 5: Express $y$ in terms of $x$\nDividing both sides by $(x - 18)$ gives $y = \\frac{18x}{x - 18}$.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the constraint that $x$ and $y$ are positive integers\nSince $x$ and $y$ must be positive integers, we need to find values of $x$ that make $y$ a positive integer as well. The expression $y = \\frac{18x}{x - 18}$ indicates that $x - 18$ must be a factor of $18x$.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze factors of 18 to minimize $x + y$\nThe factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. To minimize $x + y$, we should look for values of $x$ that are close to 18 but also result in $y$ being a positive integer.\n\n## Step 8: Test values of $x$ to find the minimum $x + y$\nLet's test $x = 19$, which is just above 18 and could potentially yield a small $y$. Plugging $x = 19$ into $y = \\frac{18x}{x - 18}$ gives $y = \\frac{18 \\cdot 19}{19 - 18} = 342$.\n\n## Step 9: Check for other potential values of $x$ that could yield smaller $y$\nFor $x = 20$, $y = \\frac{18 \\cdot 20}{20 - 18} = 180$. For $x = 21$, $y = \\frac{18 \\cdot 21}{21 - 18} = 126$. For $x = 22$, $y = \\frac{18 \\cdot 22}{22 - 18} = 99$. For $x = 23$, $y = \\frac{18 \\cdot 23}{23 - 18} = 82.8$, which is not an integer.\n\n## Step 10: Find the smallest possible value for $x + y$\nContinuing to decrease $x$ while ensuring $y$ is an integer, we notice that for $x = 24$, $y = \\frac{18 \\cdot 24}{24 - 18} = 72$. For $x = 25$, $y = \\frac{18 \\cdot 25}{25 - 18} = 62.5$, which is not an integer. For $x = 26$, $y = \\frac{18 \\cdot 26}{26 - 18} = 58.5$, which is also not an integer. For $x = 27$, $y = \\frac{18 \\cdot 27}{27 - 18} = 54$. For $x = 28$, $y = \\frac{18 \\cdot 28}{28 - 18} = 50.4$, which is not an integer. For $x = 30$, $y = \\frac{18 \\cdot 30}{30 - 18} = 45$. For $x = 36$, $y = \\frac{18 \\cdot 36}{36 - 18} = 36$.\n\n## Step 11: Identify the pair $(x, y)$ that gives the smallest sum\nFrom step 10, the pair $(x, y) = (36, 36)$ does not satisfy $x \\neq y$. However, for $x = 20$, $y = 180$, and for $x = 21$, $y = 126$. The smallest sum from the tested values where $x \\neq y$ is when $x = 19$ and $y = 342$, or other combinations like $x = 20$ and $y = 180$, but the question asks for the minimum sum $x + y$ where both are integers and $x \\neq y$.\n\n## Step 12: Re-evaluate the approach to minimize $x + y$\nSince we need $x + y$ to be minimized and both $x$ and $y$ to be integers with $x \\neq y$, let's re-evaluate our method. The equation $xy - 18x - 18y = 0$ can be rearranged using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick: $xy - 18x - 18y + 18^2 = 18^2$, which factors to $(x - 18)(y - 18) = 18^2 = 324$. We look for pairs of factors of 324 that when added to 18 give the smallest possible sum for $x + y$.\n\n## Step 13: Apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick\nThe factors of 324 are (1, 324), (2, 162), (3, 108), (4, 81), (6, 54), (9, 36), and (12, 27). Adding 18 to each factor to get $x$ and $y$ gives the pairs: (19, 342), (20, 180), (21, 126), (22, 99), (24, 72), (27, 54), and (30, 45). The smallest sum where $x \\neq y$ is from the pair (27, 54) or other similar pairs, but we seek the minimum sum.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{54 + 27 = 81}$"
