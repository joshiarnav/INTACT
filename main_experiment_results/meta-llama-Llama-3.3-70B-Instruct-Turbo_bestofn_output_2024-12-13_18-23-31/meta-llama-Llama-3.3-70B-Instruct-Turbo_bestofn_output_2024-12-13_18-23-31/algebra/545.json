    "## Step 1: Determine the slope of the line\nTo find the slope of the line, we can use the formula: $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. We can choose two points on the line to calculate the slope. Let's choose the points $(-3, -5)$ and $(2, 5)$. The slope is $\\frac{5-(-5)}{2-(-3)} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the y-intercept of the line\nTo find the y-intercept of the line, we can use the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line: $y = mx + b$. We already know the slope $m$ is $2$. Now we need to find the value of $b$. We can substitute one of the points on the line into the equation to solve for $b$. Let's use the point $(-3, -5)$. Substituting $x = -3$ and $y = -5$ into the equation $y = 2x + b$, we get $-5 = 2(-3) + b$. Solving for $b$, we have $-5 = -6 + b$, so $b = 1$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate $mb$\nNow that we have found $m = 2$ and $b = 1$, we can calculate $mb$ by multiplying $m$ and $b$. Therefore, $mb = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the components of the equation y = mx + b\nThe equation y = mx + b consists of two main components: the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b). The slope (m) represents the rate of change of the line, while the y-intercept (b) is the point at which the line crosses the y-axis.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the slope (m) of the line\nTo find the slope, we can use two points on the line. From the graph, we can see that the line passes through the points (-3, -5) and (2, 5). The slope formula is m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points. Therefore, m = (5 - (-5)) / (2 - (-3)) = (5 + 5) / (2 + 3) = 10 / 5 = 2.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the y-intercept (b) of the line\nWe can use one of the points on the line to find the y-intercept. Let's use the point (-3, -5). We substitute x = -3 and y = -5 into the equation y = mx + b and solve for b. We have -5 = 2(-3) + b. This simplifies to -5 = -6 + b. Adding 6 to both sides, we get b = 1.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the product of m and b (mb)\nNow that we have found the values of m and b, we can calculate their product. mb = 2 * 1 = 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
    "## Step 1: To find the equation of the line in the form $y=mx+b$, we first need to determine the slope ($m$) and the y-intercept ($b$).\nThe line passes through two points that can be identified on the grid: $(-3, -5)$ and $(2, 5)$.

  "solution": "Looking at the graph, we can see the line intersects the y-axis at y=1.  This is the y-intercept, which is equal to the value of $b$.  Now, we need to find the slope of the line.  Looking carefully, we can see that for every one unit to the right the line travels, it goes up by two units.  For example, starting from the y-intercept at $(0,1)$, the line passes through a lattice point one unit over and two units up from there, at $(1,3)$.  The rise over run is then $\\frac{2}{1}$, so the slope is 2.  The equation of this line is $y=2x+1$.  Therefore, $mb=2(1)=\\boxed{2}$.",
