    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a quadratic equation $2x^2-kx+8=0$ and we need to find the sum of all values of $k$ for which the equation has two distinct integer solutions.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Vieta's formulas\nFor a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the sum of the roots is given by $-\\frac{b}{a}$ and the product of the roots is given by $\\frac{c}{a}$. Applying this to the given equation, we get that the sum of the roots is $\\frac{k}{2}$ and the product of the roots is $\\frac{8}{2}=4$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the product of the roots\nSince the product of the roots is 4, the possible pairs of distinct integer roots are $(1, 4)$, $(-1, -4)$, $(2, 2)$, and $(-2, -2)$. However, we are looking for distinct integer solutions, so we can exclude $(2, 2)$ and $(-2, -2)$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of the roots for each pair\nFor the pair $(1, 4)$, the sum of the roots is $1+4=5$. For the pair $(-1, -4)$, the sum of the roots is $-1+(-4)=-5$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the corresponding values of $k$\nUsing the formula for the sum of the roots, we get $\\frac{k}{2}=5$ and $\\frac{k}{2}=-5$. Solving for $k$, we get $k=10$ and $k=-10$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the sum of the values of $k$\nThe sum of the values of $k$ is $10+(-10)=0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and what is being asked\nWe are given a quadratic equation $2x^2 - kx + 8 = 0$ and asked to find the sum of all values of $k$ for which this equation has two distinct integer solutions.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the conditions for a quadratic equation to have distinct integer solutions\nFor a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are given by the formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. For the solutions to be distinct integers, the discriminant $\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$ must be a rational number (specifically, an integer) and the entire expression must simplify to an integer.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the conditions for distinct integer solutions to the given equation\nFor the equation $2x^2 - kx + 8 = 0$, $a = 2$, $b = -k$, and $c = 8$. The solutions are given by $x = \\frac{k \\pm \\sqrt{k^2 - 4*2*8}}{2*2} = \\frac{k \\pm \\sqrt{k^2 - 64}}{4}$. For these solutions to be distinct integers, $\\sqrt{k^2 - 64}$ must be an integer.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the condition for the discriminant to be a perfect square\nThe expression under the square root, $k^2 - 64$, must be a perfect square for the solutions to be integers. Let's denote this perfect square as $m^2$, where $m$ is an integer. So, $k^2 - 64 = m^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $k$ in terms of $m$\nRearranging the equation gives $k^2 = m^2 + 64$. This means $k^2$ must be a perfect square that is 64 more than another perfect square.\n\n## Step 6: Find pairs of perfect squares with a difference of 64\nThe difference between two perfect squares can be factored as $(m + n)(m - n) = 64$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers and $m^2$ and $n^2$ are the perfect squares in question. However, given that we seek $k^2 = m^2 + 64$, a more direct approach is considering values of $m$ and checking if $m^2 + 64$ is also a perfect square.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate possible values of $m$\nWe examine values of $m$ to see if $m^2 + 64$ equals another perfect square. Notably, $m=0$ yields $k^2 = 64$, hence $k = \\pm 8$. For $m = 1$, $k^2 = 65$, which is not a perfect square. For $m = 2$, $k^2 = 68$, also not a perfect square. For $m = 3$, $k^2 = 73$, again not a perfect square. For $m = 4$, $k^2 = 80$, not a perfect square. For $m = 5$, $k^2 = 89$, not a perfect square. For $m = 6$, $k^2 = 100$, so $k = \\pm 10$. For $m = 7$, $k^2 = 113$, not a perfect square. For $m = 8$, $k^2 = 128$, which is not a perfect square but $m=8$ gives us $k^2 = 128 = 16^2 - 8^2$, fitting our difference of squares condition but actually we look for $k^2 = m^2 + 64$ directly.\n\n## Step 8: Sum the valid $k$ values\nThe valid values for $k$ from step 7 are $8$ and $-8$ and also $10$ and $-10$ from direct evaluation. Summing these values gives $8 - 8 + 10 - 10 = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
    "## Step 1: Recall the conditions for a quadratic equation to have two distinct integer solutions.\nA quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ has two distinct integer solutions if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is a perfect square and the roots are integers.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the condition for two distinct integer solutions to the given equation.\nFor the given equation $2x^2-kx+8=0$, we need the discriminant $(-k)^2-4(2)(8)$ to be a perfect square. This simplifies to $k^2-64$ being a perfect square.\n\n## Step 3: Express the condition as an equation.\nThe equation based on the condition is $k^2-64 = m^2$, where $m$ is an integer.\n\n## Step 4: Rearrange the equation to highlight the relationship between $k$ and $m$.\nRearranging gives $k^2 = m^2 + 64$.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the possible values of $m$ that make $k$ an integer.\nSince $k^2$ must be an integer, $m^2 + 64$ must also be an integer. This means $m$ must be an integer as well.\n\n## Step 6: Look for pairs of perfect squares with a difference of 64.\nTo find integer solutions for $k$, we look for perfect squares that differ by 64. One such pair is $8^2$ and $0^2$ because $8^2 - 0^2 = 64$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $k$ using the pairs of perfect squares.\nFor $m=0$ and $k=8$ (since $8^2 = 64$), we get one possible value of $k$. For $m=8$ and $k$ being the square root of $8^2 + 64 = 128$, $k$ would not be an integer. However, considering negative values, $k$ could also be $-8$.\n\n## Step 8: Check if the roots of the quadratic equation are integers for $k=8$ and $k=-8$.\nFor $k=8$, the equation becomes $2x^2-8x+8=0$. Simplifying, we get $x^2-4x+4=0$, which factors into $(x-2)^2=0$. This has a repeated root, not distinct roots, so $k=8$ does not satisfy the condition of distinct integer solutions.\n\nFor $k=-8$, the equation becomes $2x^2+8x+8=0$. Simplifying, we get $x^2+4x+4=0$, which factors into $(x+2)^2=0$. This also has a repeated root, not distinct roots, so $k=-8$ does not satisfy the condition either.\n\n## Step 9: Reconsider the approach for finding $k$.\nGiven that the steps above led to a misunderstanding in applying the conditions for integer roots, we should directly apply Vieta's formulas for sum and product of roots. For a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ with roots $r_1$ and $r_2$, the sum of the roots $r_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{b}{a}$ and the product of the roots $r_1 \\cdot r_2 = \\frac{c}{a}$.\n\n## Step 10: Apply Vieta's formulas to the given equation.\nFor $2x^2-kx+8=0$, the sum of the roots is $\\frac{k}{2}$ and the product of the roots is $\\frac{8}{2} = 4$. Since we are looking for distinct integer solutions, the product of the roots being 4 gives us pairs of integers that multiply to 4: $(1, 4)$, $(-1, -4)$, $(2, 2)$, and $(-2, -2)$. However, since the roots must be distinct, we only consider $(1, 4)$ and $(-1, -4)$.\n\n## Step 11: Solve for $k$ using the sum of the roots.\nFor the pair $(1, 4)$, the sum of the roots is $1 + 4 = 5 = \\frac{k}{2}$. Solving for $k$ gives $k = 10$. For the pair $(-1, -4)$, the sum of the roots is $-1 + (-4) = -5 = \\frac{k}{2}$. Solving for $k$ gives $k = -10$.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the sum of all possible values of $k$.\nThe sum of all possible values of $k$ is $10 + (-10) = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"

  "solution": "We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively. Let the two roots of the equation be $p$ and $q$. Then $p+q=k/2$. However the only other restriction on $p$ and $q$ is that $pq = 4$ and that $p$ and $q$ are distinct integers. For each such possibility $(p,q)$, we also have the possibility $(-p,-q)$ since $(-p)(-q) = pq = 4$. This gives two values of $k$: $k=2(p+q)$ and $k=2(-p-q)$. Since these occur in such pairs, the sum of all possible values of $k$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nAlternatively, one can note that the only way to factor 4 into 2 distinct integer factors is $4\\cdot1$ and $(-4)(-1)$, so that the two possible values of $k$ are $10$ and $-10$, given a sum of $0$.",
