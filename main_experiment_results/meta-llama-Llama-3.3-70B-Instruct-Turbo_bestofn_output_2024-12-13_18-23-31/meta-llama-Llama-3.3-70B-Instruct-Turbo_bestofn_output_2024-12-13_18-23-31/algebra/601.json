    "## Step 1: To find the intersection points of the two parabolas, we need to set their equations equal to each other.\nSetting the two equations equal gives us $3x^2+4x-5=x^2+11$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the equation by moving all terms to one side to solve for x.\nCombine like terms to get $3x^2 - x^2 + 4x - 5 - 11 = 0$, which simplifies to $2x^2 + 4x - 16 = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation for x.\nTo solve $2x^2 + 4x - 16 = 0$, we can use the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 2$, $b = 4$, and $c = -16$.\n\n## Step 4: Plug the values of a, b, and c into the quadratic formula.\nSubstituting the values into the formula gives $x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{(4)^2 - 4(2)(-16)}}{2(2)}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the equation inside the square root.\nThis simplifies to $x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 128}}{4}$, which further simplifies to $x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{144}}{4}$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for x.\nSolving for x gives $x = \\frac{-4 \\pm 12}{4}$. This results in two possible values for x: $x_1 = \\frac{-4 + 12}{4} = 2$ and $x_2 = \\frac{-4 - 12}{4} = -4$.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute the x-values back into one of the original equations to find the corresponding y-values.\nFor $x = 2$, using $y = x^2 + 11$ gives $y = (2)^2 + 11 = 4 + 11 = 15$. For $x = -4$, it gives $y = (-4)^2 + 11 = 16 + 11 = 27$.\n\n## Step 8: List the points of intersection in order of increasing x-coordinate.\nThe points of intersection are $(-4, 27)$ and $(2, 15)$. In order of increasing x-coordinate, the points are $(-4, 27); (2, 15)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(-4, 27); (2, 15)}$",
    "## Step 1: To find the points where the two parabolas intersect, we need to set their equations equal to each other and solve for x.\nWe have the equations $y=3x^2+4x-5$ and $y=x^2+11$. Setting them equal gives $3x^2+4x-5=x^2+11$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the equation by moving all terms to one side to set it equal to zero.\nThis results in $3x^2+4x-5-x^2-11=0$, which simplifies to $2x^2+4x-16=0$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation for x.\nWe can use the quadratic formula, $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=2$, $b=4$, and $c=-16$. Plugging these values into the formula gives $x=\\frac{-4\\pm\\sqrt{4^2-4*2*(-16)}}{2*2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the discriminant and solve for x.\nThe discriminant is $b^2-4ac = 4^2-4*2*(-16) = 16+128 = 144$. So, $x=\\frac{-4\\pm\\sqrt{144}}{4}$, which simplifies to $x=\\frac{-4\\pm12}{4}$. This gives two solutions: $x=\\frac{-4+12}{4}=2$ and $x=\\frac{-4-12}{4}=-4$.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute the x values back into one of the original equations to find the corresponding y values.\nFor $x=2$, using $y=x^2+11$, we get $y=2^2+11=4+11=15$. For $x=-4$, we get $y=(-4)^2+11=16+11=27$.\n\n## Step 6: List the points of intersection in order of increasing x-coordinate.\nThe points are $(-4, 27)$ and $(2, 15)$.

  "solution": "Setting the right-hand sides of the given equations equal gives $3x^2+4x-5=x^2+11$. Combining like terms gives $2x^2+4x=16$. Dividing by $2$ gives $x^2+2x=8$, and rearranging gives $x^2 +2x - 8=0$.  Factoring gives $(x+4)(x-2)=0$, so our solutions are $x=-4$ and $x=2$.  Substituting these into either of the original equations to find the corresponding values of $y$, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-4, 27);(2, 15)}$.",
