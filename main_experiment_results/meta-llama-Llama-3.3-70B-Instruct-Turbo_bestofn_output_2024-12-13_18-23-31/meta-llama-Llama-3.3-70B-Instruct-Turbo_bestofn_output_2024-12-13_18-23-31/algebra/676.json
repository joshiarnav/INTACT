    "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nWe have a rectangular prism with a length ($l$) of 3, a height ($h$) of 12, and the length of its diagonal is given as 13. We need to find the width ($w$) of the prism.\n\n## Step 2: Use the formula for the length of the diagonal\nThe formula for the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism is $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}$. We are given that this length is 13. So, we can set up the equation $\\sqrt{3^2 + w^2 + 12^2} = 13$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the equation for $w$\nFirst, we square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root: $3^2 + w^2 + 12^2 = 13^2$. This simplifies to $9 + w^2 + 144 = 169$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify and solve for $w^2$\nCombine the constants on the left side: $w^2 + 153 = 169$. Then, subtract 153 from both sides to isolate $w^2$: $w^2 = 169 - 153$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $w^2$\nSubtract to find $w^2$: $w^2 = 16$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $w$\nTake the square root of both sides to solve for $w$: $w = \\sqrt{16}$. Since width cannot be negative, $w = 4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
