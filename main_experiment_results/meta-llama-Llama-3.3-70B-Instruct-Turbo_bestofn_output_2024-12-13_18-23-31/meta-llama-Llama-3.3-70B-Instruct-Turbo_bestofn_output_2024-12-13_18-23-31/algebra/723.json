    "## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the goal\nWe are given the equation $xy+5x+4y=-5$, and we need to find the greatest possible value of $y$ for integer values of $x$ and $y$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick to the given equation\nUsing Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we can add $20$ to both sides of the equation to get $xy+5x+4y+20=15$. This can be factored into $(x+4)(y+5)=15$.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the factor pairs of $15$\nThe factor pairs of $15$ are $(1,15)$, $(3,5)$, $(-1,-15)$, and $(-3,-5)$. These pairs represent the possible combinations of $(x+4)$ and $(y+5)$ that satisfy the equation.\n\n## Step 4: Find the corresponding values of $y$ for each factor pair\nFor $(x+4, y+5) = (1, 15)$, we have $y+5=15$, which gives $y=10$.\nFor $(x+4, y+5) = (3, 5)$, we have $y+5=5$, which gives $y=0$.\nFor $(x+4, y+5) = (15, 1)$, we have $y+5=1$, which gives $y=-4$.\nFor $(x+4, y+5) = (-1, -15)$, we have $y+5=-15$, which gives $y=-20$.\nFor $(x+4, y+5) = (-3, -5)$, we have $y+5=-5$, which gives $y=-10$.\nFor $(x+4, y+5) = (-15, -1)$, we have $y+5=-1$, which gives $y=-6$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the greatest possible value of $y$\nAmong the possible values of $y$ obtained, the greatest value is $10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",
    "## Step 1: Rearrange the given equation\nThe given equation is $xy+5x+4y=-5$. We can rearrange this equation to prepare it for factorization by adding a constant to both sides. Adding 20 to both sides gives $xy+5x+4y+20=15$.\n\n## Step 2: Factorize the rearranged equation\nNow, we try to factorize the rearranged equation. The equation can be rewritten as $(x+4)(y+5)=15$. This step involves finding two numbers that multiply to give 15 and then setting up the factors accordingly.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the factor pairs of 15\nThe factor pairs of 15 are (1, 15) and (3, 5). Since $(x+4)$ and $(y+5)$ must be integers, we consider these pairs to find possible values for $x$ and $y$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for y using the factor pairs\nUsing the factor pairs, we set up equations for $(x+4)$ and $(y+5)$:\n1. $(x+4)(y+5)=15$ could be $(x+4)=1$ and $(y+5)=15$, or\n2. $(x+4)=3$ and $(y+5)=5$, or\n3. $(x+4)=5$ and $(y+5)=3$, or\n4. $(x+4)=15$ and $(y+5)=1$.\nFrom these, solving for $y$ gives us the potential values of $y$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the potential values of y\n1. If $(y+5)=15$, then $y=10$.\n2. If $(y+5)=5$, then $y=0$.\n3. If $(y+5)=3$, then $y=-2$.\n4. If $(y+5)=1$, then $y=-4$.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the greatest possible value of y\nAmong the potential values of $y$ calculated, we need to find the greatest one.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",

The pairs of factors of 15 are $(1, 15)$, $(3, 5)$, $(-1, -15)$, and $(-3, -5)$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $y$ using the factors of 15\nUsing the factored form $(x+4)(y+5)=15$, we can solve for $y$ by considering the possible pairs of factors. For $(x+4, y+5)$, the possible pairs are $(1, 15)$, $(15, 1)$, $(3, 5)$, $(5, 3)$, $(-1, -15)$, $(-15, -1)$, $(-3, -5)$, and $(-5, -3)$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the corresponding values of $y$\nFrom the pairs of factors, we can determine the corresponding values of $y$ by solving $y+5 = 15$, $y+5 = 1$, $y+5 = 3$, $y+5 = 5$, $y+5 = -1$, $y+5 = -15$, $y+5 = -3$, and $y+5 = -5$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the possible values of $y$\nSolving the equations from step 6, we get $y = 10$, $y = -4$, $y = -2$, $y = 0$, $y = -6$, $y = -20$, $y = -8$, and $y = -10$.\n\n## Step 8: Identify the greatest possible value of $y$\nFrom the possible values calculated in step 7, the greatest possible value of $y$ is 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"

  "solution": "Note that $(x+4)(y+5)$ equals $xy+5x+4y+20$.  So, add $20$ to both sides of the original equation to get $xy+5x+4y+20=15$, so now we may apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and write the equation as $(x+4)(y+5)=15$.\n\nThen, the potential ordered pairs $((x+4),(y+5))$ with $x<y$ are $(-15,-1)$, $(-5,-3)$, $(1,15)$ and $(3,5)$, since these are the pairs of integers that multiply to 15.  The greatest value for $y+5$ is thus $15$.  We solve $y+5=15$ for $y$ to yield $y=\\boxed{10}$.",
