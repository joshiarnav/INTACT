    "## Step 1: Determine the time it took Jordan to run 2 miles based on Steve's running time.\nSince Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles, and it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles, Jordan ran 2 miles in 24 / 2 = 12 minutes.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Jordan's running rate in miles per minute.\nTo find Jordan's running rate, we divide the distance he ran by the time it took him. So, his rate is 2 miles / 12 minutes = 1/6 miles per minute.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the time it would take Jordan to run 5 miles at his rate.\nUsing Jordan's running rate of 1/6 miles per minute, the time it would take him to run 5 miles is 5 miles / (1/6 miles/minute) = 5 * 6 = 30 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$",

    "## Step 1: Calculate the time it took Jordan to run 2 miles\nSince it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles, and Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles, we first need to find the time it took Jordan to run 2 miles. Half of Steve's time is 24 / 2 = 12 minutes.\n\n## Step 2: Determine Jordan's running rate\nTo find Jordan's running rate, we divide the distance he ran by the time it took him. His rate is 2 miles / 12 minutes = 1/6 miles per minute.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the time it would take Jordan to run 5 miles\nUsing Jordan's running rate of 1/6 miles per minute, we can calculate the time it would take him to run 5 miles. Time = Distance / Rate = 5 miles / (1/6 miles per minute) = 5 * 6 = 30 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$"

  "solution": "Since Steve's 3-mile time is 24 minutes, Jordan ran 2 miles in $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot24=12$ minutes.  Therefore, each mile takes Jordan 6 minutes to run, so he would take $6\\cdot5=\\boxed{30}$ minutes to run five miles.",
