    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of coins Alex needs to distribute among his 12 friends such that each friend gets at least one coin and no two friends receive the same number of coins. \n\nLet's start by giving 1 coin to the first friend, 2 coins to the second friend, 3 coins to the third friend, and so on, until the 12th friend gets 12 coins. \n\nThe total number of coins given away can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 12 = (12 * 13) / 2 = 78\n\nSince Alex already has 63 coins, the minimum number of additional coins he needs is the difference between the total number of coins required (78) and the number of coins he already has (63). \n\nSo, the minimum number of additional coins Alex needs is 78 - 63 = 15.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",
    "To solve this problem, let's think step by step.\n\nStep 1: Alex needs to give each of his 12 friends at least one coin, and no two friends should receive the same number of coins. The minimum number of coins he can give to his friends, ensuring each gets a different number, starts from 1 and goes up to 12 (since he has 12 friends). \n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of coins Alex would give away if he followed the sequence from 1 to 12 coins per friend. This is essentially the sum of the first 12 natural numbers. The formula to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers is \\( \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\).\n\nStep 3: Apply the formula for n = 12 to find the total number of coins needed:\n\\[ \\frac{12(12 + 1)}{2} = \\frac{12 \\times 13}{2} = 6 \\times 13 = 78 \\]\n\nStep 4: Since Alex has 63 coins and he needs a total of 78 coins to achieve his goal, we need to find out how many more coins he needs. This is calculated by subtracting the number of coins he has from the total number needed:\n\\[ 78 - 63 = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, Alex needs 15 more coins to ensure each of his 12 friends receives at least one coin and that no two friends receive the same number of coins.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",
    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Requirement**: Alex needs to give each of his 12 friends at least one coin, and no two friends can receive the same number of coins. This means the distribution must be such that each friend gets a unique number of coins.\n\n2. **Minimum Distribution**: The minimum distribution that satisfies the condition of uniqueness would start from 1 coin for the first friend, 2 coins for the second, 3 for the third, and so on until the 12th friend, who would receive 12 coins.\n\n3. **Calculating the Minimum Coins Needed**: To find the total minimum number of coins required for this unique distribution, we sum the numbers from 1 to 12. This can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is \\( \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\). For n = 12, the calculation is:\n\\[ \\frac{12(12 + 1)}{2} = \\frac{12 \\times 13}{2} = 78 \\]\n\n4. **Determining Additional Coins Needed**: Since Alex already has 63 coins and needs a total of 78 coins to achieve this unique distribution, the minimum number of additional coins he needs is:\n\\[ 78 - 63 = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, Alex needs 15 more coins to ensure each of his 12 friends receives a unique number of coins, starting from at least 1 coin.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"

  "solution": "Alex wants to minimize the number of coins he gives to his friends without giving any two of them the same number of coins. The minimum number of coins he can give to a friend is 1. He then gives 2 coins to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 12. The total number of coins Alex has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+12 = \\frac{12 \\cdot 13}{2}=78$.  Thus, Alex needs $78-63=\\boxed{15}$ more coins.",
