    "## Step 1: Define the variables for the initial number of ants of each species.\nLet's denote the initial number of ants of Species A as $A$ and the initial number of ants of Species B as $B$. On Day 0, we have $A + B = 30$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the growth of each species over 5 days.\nSince the number of ants of Species A doubles every day, after 5 days, the number of ants of Species A will be $2^5 \\cdot A = 32A$.\nSimilarly, the number of ants of Species B triples every day, so after 5 days, the number of ants of Species B will be $3^5 \\cdot B = 243B$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the total number of ants on Day 5.\nWe know that on Day 5, the total number of ants is 3281. So, we can set up the equation $32A + 243B = 3281$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the system of equations for A and B.\nWe have two equations:\n1. $A + B = 30$\n2. $32A + 243B = 3281$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of $A$ and $B$.\n\n## Step 5: Express B in terms of A from the first equation.\nFrom the first equation, $B = 30 - A$.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute B in the second equation and solve for A.\nSubstituting $B = 30 - A$ into the second equation gives us $32A + 243(30 - A) = 3281$.\nSimplifying, we get $32A + 7290 - 243A = 3281$.\nCombining like terms, $-211A = -4009$.\nSolving for $A$, $A = 19$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of ants of Species A on Day 5.\nSince $A = 19$, the number of ants of Species A on Day 5 is $32 \\cdot 19 = 608$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{608}$",

    "## Step 1: Define the problem and identify what we need to find\nWe are given that Anton has two species of ants in his ant farm, Species A and Species B. The number of ants of Species A doubles every day, and the number of ants of Species B triples every day. On Day 0, there are 30 ants in total, and by Day 5, the total number of ants is 3281.

  "solution": "Suppose that there are $a$ ants of Species A and $b$ ants of Species B on Day 0. We thus have that $a+b=30$. Notice that on Day 1, there will be $2a$ ants of Species A, on Day 2, there will be $2(2a) = 4a$ ants of Species A, and on Day 3, there will be $2(4a)=8a$ ants of Species A, etc. Following this line of reasoning, on Day 5, there will be $2^5a$ ants of Species A and $3^5b$ ants of Species B, meaning that $32a+243b=3281$. We now solve this system of linear equations. We have that $32a+32b=960$, so \\begin{align*}(32a+243b)-(32a+32b) &= 211b \\\\\n&= 3281-960 \\\\\n&= 2321.\\end{align*}We then have $b = \\frac{2321}{211} = 11$. This means that $a=30-11=19$, and there are $32\\cdot 19 = \\boxed{608}$ ants of Species A on Day 5.",
