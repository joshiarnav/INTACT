    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and define the variables\nLet's denote the two positive integers as $x$ and $y$. We are given that their product plus their sum equals 103, which can be written as $xy + x + y = 103$. Also, $x$ and $y$ are relatively prime and each is less than 20.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick\nWe can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick to factor the equation $xy + x + y = 103$. Adding 1 to both sides gives us $xy + x + y + 1 = 104$. This can be factored into $(x+1)(y+1) = 104$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the factor pairs of 104\nNow, we need to find the pairs of factors of 104. The pairs are: $(1, 104)$, $(2, 52)$, $(4, 26)$, $(8, 13)$. Since $x$ and $y$ are less than 20, we only consider pairs where both factors are less than 21.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the relatively prime condition\nGiven that $x$ and $y$ are relatively prime, we need to find a pair of factors of 104 where $x+1$ and $y+1$ have no common factor other than 1. The pair $(8, 13)$ seems promising because 8 and 13 are relatively prime.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $x$ and $y$\nFrom the pair $(8, 13)$, we can solve for $x$ and $y$. If $x+1 = 8$ and $y+1 = 13$, then $x = 7$ and $y = 12$. We should verify if these values satisfy the original equation and the condition that they are relatively prime.\n\n## Step 6: Verify the solution\nPlugging $x = 7$ and $y = 12$ into the original equation gives $7 \\times 12 + 7 + 12 = 84 + 19 = 103$, which matches the given condition. Also, 7 and 12 are relatively prime, satisfying another condition of the problem.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the sum of $x$ and $y$\nThe sum of the two integers $x$ and $y$ is $7 + 12 = 19$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$",
    "## Step 1: Define the problem and identify key constraints\nWe are looking for two positive integers, let's call them $x$ and $y$, such that their product plus their sum equals 103. Additionally, $x$ and $y$ are relatively prime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1, and each is less than 20.\n\n## Step 2: Set up the equation based on the given information\nThe equation representing the problem is $xy + x + y = 103$. We need to solve this equation for $x$ and $y$ under the given constraints.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick to the equation\nTo make the equation more manageable, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, which involves adding 1 to both sides of the equation to get $xy + x + y + 1 = 104$. This can be factored into $(x + 1)(y + 1) = 104$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the factor pairs of 104\nWe need to find all the factor pairs of 104, which are pairs of numbers that multiply to give 104. The factor pairs of 104 are (1, 104), (2, 52), (4, 26), (8, 13).\n\n## Step 5: Adjust for the original variables and apply the constraints\nSince we used $x + 1$ and $y + 1$ in our factored equation, we need to subtract 1 from each part of the factor pairs to find potential values for $x$ and $y$. This gives us the pairs (0, 103), (1, 51), (3, 25), (7, 12). We then apply the constraints that $x$ and $y$ must be positive integers less than 20 and relatively prime.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the pair that meets all the constraints\nAmong the adjusted pairs, (7, 12) is the only pair that meets all the constraints: both numbers are positive integers less than 20, and they are relatively prime.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the sum of the two integers\nNow, we calculate the sum of the two integers that meet the criteria. The sum is $7 + 12 = 19$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$",

Adding 1 to both sides gives us $xy + x + y + 1 = 104$. This can be rewritten as $(x+1)(y+1) = 104$.\n\n## Step 3: Factor 104\nNow, we need to find the pairs of factors of 104. The factors of 104 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 26, 52, and 104. We are looking for pairs of factors that multiply to !04.\n\n## Step 4: Identify relevant factor pairs of 104\nThe pairs of factors of 104 are: (1, 104), (2, 52), (4, 26), and (8, 13). Since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers less than 20, and given that $x+1$ and $y+1$ must also be less than 21 (since $x$ and $y$ are less than 20), we can examine these pairs for suitability.\n\n## Step 5: Examine each pair for suitability\n- The pair (1, 104) gives $x=0$, which is not valid since $x$ must be a positive integer.\n- The pair (2, 52) gives $x=1$, $y=51$, which is not valid since $y$ is not less than 20.\n- The pair (4, 26) gives $x=3$, $y=25$, which is not valid since $y$ is not less than 20.\n- The pair (8, 13) gives $x=7$, $y=12$, which is valid since both $x$ and $y$ are less than 20 and positive.\n\n## Step 6: Check for relative primality\nWe must ensure that $x$ and $y$ are relatively prime. For $x=7$ and $y=12$, their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1, meaning they are relatively prime.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the sum of the two integers\nThe sum of $x$ and $y$ is $7 + 12 = 19$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$"

  "solution": "Let our numbers be $a$ and $b$ with $a>b.$ Then $ab+a+b=103$. With Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick in mind, we add $1$ to both sides and get $ab+a+b+1 = 104$, which factors as $(a+1)(b+1)=104$. We consider pairs $(a+1, b+1)$ of factors of $104$: $(104,1), (52,2), (26,4), (13,8)$. Since $a<20$, we can rule out the first 3 pairs, which gives $a=12$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\\boxed{19}$.",
