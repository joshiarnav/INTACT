    "## Step 1: Identify the pattern of growth\nAt each stage, a 3'' by 3'' square is added to the rectangle.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of squares at each stage\nAt Stage 1, there is 1 square. At Stage 2, there are 2 squares. This pattern continues, with the number of squares increasing by 1 at each successive stage.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of squares at Stage 6\nFollowing the pattern, at Stage 6, there will be 6 squares.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total area at Stage 6\nEach square has an area of $3 \\times 3 = 9$ square inches. Since there are 6 squares at Stage 6, the total area will be $6 \\times 9 = 54$ square inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{54}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the pattern of square additions\nAt each stage, a 3'' by 3'' square is added to the existing rectangle.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of squares at Stage 6\nSince one square is added at each stage, at Stage 6, there will be 6 squares in total.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area of one square\nThe area of one square is 3 * 3 = 9 square inches.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total area at Stage 6\nTo find the total area at Stage 6, multiply the area of one square by the total number of squares at Stage 6. total_area = 9 * 6 = 54 square inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{54}$",

  "solution": "The number of squares in the rectangles is an arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference 1. Thus, at Stage 6, there will be 6 squares. Since each square has an area of $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ square inches, the total area of the rectangle at Stage 6 is $6 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{54}$ square inches.",
