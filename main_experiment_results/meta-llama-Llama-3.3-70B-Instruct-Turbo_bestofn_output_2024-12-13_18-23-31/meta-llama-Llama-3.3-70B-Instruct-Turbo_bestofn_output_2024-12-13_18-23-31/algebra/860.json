    "## Step 1: Factor the given equation\nThe equation given is $x^2 + ax = -14$. We can factor out $x$ to get $x(x + a) = -14$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the factors of -14\nTo find integer solutions for $x$, we need to consider the factors of $-14$. The factors of $-14$ are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14$.\n\n## Step 3: Pair the factors to satisfy the equation\nWe need to find pairs of factors that multiply to $-14$. The pairs are: $(1, -14)$, $(-1, 14)$, $(2, -7)$, $(-2, 7)$.\n\n## Step 4: Relate the pairs to $x$ and $(x + a)$\nSince $x(x + a) = -14$, we can relate each pair of factors to $x$ and $(x + a)$. For example, for the pair $(1, -14)$, we can let $x = 1$ and $x + a = -14$, or $x = -14$ and $x + a = 1$. We do the same for the other pairs.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $a$ in each case\nFor $(1, -14)$:\n- If $x = 1$ and $x + a = -14$, then $1 + a = -14$, so $a = -15$. This $a$ is not positive, so we discard it.\n- If $x = -14$ and $x + a = 1$, then $-14 + a = 1$, so $a = 15$.\n\nFor $(-1, 14)$:\n- If $x = -1$ and $x + a = 14$, then $-1 + a = 14$, so $a = 15$.\n- If $x = 14$ and $x + a = -1$, then $14 + a = -1$, so $a = -15$. This $a$ is not positive, so we discard it.\n\nFor $(2, -7)$:\n- If $x = 2$ and $x + a = -7$, then $2 + a = -7$, so $a = -9$. This $a$ is not positive, so we discard it.\n- If $x = -7$ and $x + a = 2$, then $-7 + a = 2$, so $a = 9$.\n\nFor $(-2, 7)$:\n- If $x = -2$ and $x + a = 7$, then $-2 + a = 7$, so $a = 9$.\n- If $x = 7$ and $x + a = -2$, then $7 + a = -2$, so $a = -9$. This $a$ is not positive, so we discard it.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the greatest possible value of $a$\nFrom the cases that yield a positive $a$, the greatest value of $a$ is $15$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",
    "## Step 1: Factor the given equation\nWe start by factoring the given equation $x^2 + ax = -14$. This can be rewritten as $x^2 + ax + 14 = 0$. Factoring this quadratic equation, we get $(x + p)(x + q) = 0$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers.\n\n## Step 2: Express the equation in its factored form\nFrom the factored form, we can express the equation as $x^2 + ax + 14 = (x + p)(x + q) = x^2 + (p + q)x + pq$. This implies that $a = p + q$ and $pq = 14$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the pairs of integers whose product is 14\nWe need to find pairs of integers $(p, q)$ whose product is 14. The possible pairs are $(1, 14)$, $(-1, -14)$, $(2, 7)$, and $(-2, -7)$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the possible values of $a$\nUsing the pairs from Step 3, we calculate the possible values of $a$ by adding the pairs: $a = 1 + 14 = 15$, $a = -1 - 14 = -15$, $a = 2 + 7 = 9$, and $a = -2 - 7 = -9$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the greatest positive value of $a$\nSince $a$ must be a positive integer, the greatest possible value of $a$ from the calculated values is 15.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",
    "## Step 1: Factor the given equation\nWe can factor the given equation $x^2 + ax = -14$ as $x(x + a) = -14$. This step is important because it helps us understand how the solutions for $x$ are related to the value of $a$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the integer factor pairs of -14\nTo find the integer solutions for $x$, we need to identify all the integer factor pairs of -14. The factor pairs of -14 are: $(1, -14)$, $(-1, 14)$, $(2, -7)$, and $(-2, 7)$.\n\n## Step 3: Relate the factor pairs to the equation\nFrom the factorization $x(x + a) = -14$, we can see that $x$ and $x + a$ must be a factor pair of -14. For example, if $x = 1$, then $x + a = -14$, which gives $a = -15$. However, since $a$ must be positive, this solution is not valid. We need to consider all factor pairs and find the corresponding values of $a$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the possible values of $a$\nUsing the factor pairs, we can calculate the possible values of $a$:\n- For $(1, -14)$, we have $x = 1$ and $x + a = -14$, giving $a = -15$, which is not valid since $a$ must be positive.\n- For $(-1, 14)$, we have $x = -1$ and $x + a = 14$, giving $a = 15$, which is a valid positive value for $a$.\n- For $(2, -7)$, we have $x = 2$ and $x + a = -7$, giving $a = -9$, which is not valid since $a$ must be positive.\n- For $(-2, 7)$, we have $x = -2$ and $x + a = 7$, giving $a = 9$, which is a valid positive value for $a$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the greatest possible value of $a$\nFrom the calculations, the greatest possible value of $a$ that is positive and results in integer solutions for $x$ is 15.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"

  "solution": "The left-hand side factors into $x(x+a)=-14$, so $x$ and $x+a$ both divide $-14$. One of the two factors is negative and the other positive, since their product is negative. $x+a>x$, so $x+a>0$ and $x<0$. This leaves 4 possibilities for $x$, since it is negative and divides $-14$ evenly: $-1$, $-2$, $-7$, and $-14$. $x=-1$ gives $x+a=14$ and therefore $a=15$. Similarly, $x=-2$, $x=-7$, and $x=-14$ give $a=9$, $a=9$, and $a=15$, respectively. The largest value for $a$ is thus $\\boxed{15}$.",
