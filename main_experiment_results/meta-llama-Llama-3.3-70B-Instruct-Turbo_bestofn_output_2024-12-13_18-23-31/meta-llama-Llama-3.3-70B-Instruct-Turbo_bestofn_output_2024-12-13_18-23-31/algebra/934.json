    "## Step 1: Understand the properties of the given quadratic equation\nThe vertex form of a quadratic equation is given by $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola. Given that the vertex is $(-4, 0)$, we can write the equation as $y = a(x + 4)^2$.\n\n## Step 2: Use the given point to find the value of $a$\nSince the parabola passes through the point $(1, -75)$, we can substitute $x = 1$ and $y = -75$ into the equation to solve for $a$. Plugging these values into the equation $y = a(x + 4)^2$, we get $-75 = a(1 + 4)^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $a$\nNow, we solve the equation $-75 = a(5)^2$ for $a$. This simplifies to $-75 = 25a$. To find $a$, we divide both sides by $25$, giving $a = -75 / 25$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the value of $a$\nPerforming the division, we find $a = -3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-3}$",
