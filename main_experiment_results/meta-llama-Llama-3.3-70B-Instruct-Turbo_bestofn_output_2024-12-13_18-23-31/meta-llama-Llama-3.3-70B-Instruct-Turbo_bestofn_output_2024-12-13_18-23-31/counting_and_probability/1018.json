    "## Step 1: Identify the type of problem\nThis is a binomial probability problem, where we have a fixed number of trials (10 coin flips), each trial has only two possible outcomes (heads or tails), the probability of success (getting heads) is the same for every trial (0.5, since it's a fair coin), and the trials are independent.\n\n## Step 2: Define the parameters\n- Number of trials (n) = 10\n- Number of successful trials (k) = 8 (since we want exactly 8 heads)\n- Probability of success on a single trial (p) = 0.5 (since the coin is fair)\n- Probability of failure on a single trial (q) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\n## Step 3: Apply the binomial probability formula\nThe formula for the binomial probability is given by:\n\\[P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k q^{n-k}\\]\nwhere \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, calculated as \\(n! / [k!(n-k)!]\\).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the binomial coefficient\n\\[\\binom{10}{8} = \\frac{10!}{8!(10-8)!} = \\frac{10!}{8!2!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45\\]\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability\n\\[P(X = 8) = \\binom{10}{8} \\times (0.5)^8 \\times (0.5)^{10-8} = 45 \\times (0.5)^8 \\times (0.5)^2 = 45 \\times (0.5)^{10}\\]\n\\[P(X = 8) = 45 \\times \\frac{1}{2^{10}} = 45 \\times \\frac{1}{1024}\\]\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the fraction\n\\[P(X = 8) = \\frac{45}{1024}\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{45}{1024}}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to get exactly 8 heads in 10 flips\nTo find the number of ways to get exactly 8 heads in 10 flips, we can use the binomial coefficient formula. The binomial coefficient, often referred to as \"n choose k\", is calculated as $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of trials, $k$ is the number of successful outcomes, and $!$ denotes factorial. For our problem, $n = 10$ (total flips) and $k = 8$ (number of heads we want).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the binomial coefficient for getting exactly 8 heads in 10 flips\nUsing the formula from Step 1, we calculate $\\binom{10}{8} = \\frac{10!}{8!(10-8)!} = \\frac{10!}{8!2!}$. Simplifying, $\\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}{8! \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45$. So, there are 45 ways to get exactly 8 heads in 10 flips.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the total number of possible outcomes for 10 coin flips\nEach flip has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails), and there are 10 flips in total. The total number of outcomes for 10 flips is $2^{10} = 1024$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of getting exactly 8 heads in 10 flips\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes (getting exactly 8 heads) divided by the total number of possible outcomes. From Step 2, we have 45 favorable outcomes, and from Step 3, we have ! Calculate the probability\nThe probability of getting exactly 8 heads in 10 flips is $\\frac{45}{1024}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{45}{1024}}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to get exactly 8 heads out of 10 flips\nTo find the number of ways to get exactly 8 heads out of 10 flips, we can use the combination formula. The formula for combinations is $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of trials (flips in this case), $k$ is the number of successful outcomes (heads in this case), and $!$ denotes factorial. For our problem, $n = 10$ and $k = 8$. So, the number of ways to get exactly 8 heads is $\\binom{10}{8} = \\frac{10!}{8!(10-8)!} = \\frac{10!}{8!2!}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the factorial values and solve the combination formula\nNow, let's calculate the factorial values and solve the combination formula. $10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 3628800$, $8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 40320$, and $2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2$. Plugging these into the combination formula gives $\\binom{10}{8} = \\frac{3628800}{40320 \\times 2} = \\frac{3628800}{80640} = 45$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of getting exactly 8 heads in 10 flips\nThe probability of getting heads on a single flip is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of getting tails is also $\\frac{1}{2}$. Since we want exactly 8 heads out of 10 flips, the probability of any single sequence of 8 heads and 2 tails (like HHHHHHHHTT) is $(\\frac{1}{2})^8 \\times (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = (\\frac{1}{2})^{10}$. Since there are 45 different ways to get exactly 8 heads out of 10 flips, the total probability is $45 \\times (\\frac{1}{2})^{10}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final probability\nNow, let's calculate the final probability. $(\\frac{1}{2})^{10} = \\frac{1}{1024}$, so $45 \\times \\frac{1}{1024} = \\frac{45}{1024}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{45}{1024}}$"
