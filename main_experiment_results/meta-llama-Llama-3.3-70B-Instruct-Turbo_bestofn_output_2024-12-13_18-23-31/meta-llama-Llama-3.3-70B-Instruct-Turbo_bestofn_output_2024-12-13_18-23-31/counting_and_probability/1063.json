    "## Step 1: First, let's analyze the given conditions for the sequence.\nWe are given that the sequence must begin with L, end with Q, and no letter can appear in a sequence more than once.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the total number of letters available in the word EQUALS.\nThe word EQUALS has 6 letters: E, Q, U, A, L, S.\n\n## Step 3: Since the first letter must be L and the last letter must be Q, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the remaining two letters from the available letters (excluding L and Q).\nAfter placing L and Q, we are left with 4 letters: E, U, A, S.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose the second letter of the sequence.\nSince no letter can appear more than once and L and Q are already placed, there are 4 options for the second letter (E, U, A, S).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to choose the third letter of the sequence.\nAfter selecting the second letter, there will be 3 remaining letters to choose from for the third position.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of distinct sequences using the multiplication principle.\nThe total number of sequences is the product of the number of choices for each position: 1 (for L) * 4 (for the second letter) * 3 (for the third letter) * 1 (for Q).\n\n## Step 7: Perform the multiplication.\n1 * 4 * 3 * 1 = 12\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the total letters and the constraints.\nThe word EQUALS has 6 letters: E, Q, U, A, L, S. The sequence must start with L, end with Q, and no letter can be repeated.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the fixed positions.\nSince the sequence must begin with L and end with Q, these two positions are fixed. This leaves us with the middle two positions to fill.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of options for the second position.\nWith L and Q already used, we have 4 letters left (E, U, A, S) that can fill the second position. So, there are 4 options for the second position.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of options for the third position.\nAfter filling the second position, we have 3 letters left that can fill the third position, since no letter can be repeated. So, there are 3 options for the third position.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of distinct sequences.\nTo find the total number of distinct sequences, we multiply the number of options for each position. Since the first and last positions are fixed, we only multiply the options for the second and third positions: 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of letters and the specific conditions given for the sequence.\nWe have the letters E, Q, U, A, L, and S. The conditions are that the sequence must start with L, end with Q, and no letter can be repeated.\n\n## Step 2: Place the letters that are already determined in the sequence.\nGiven that the sequence must start with L and end with Q, we have: L _ _ Q.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of choices for the second position in the sequence.\nSince we cannot repeat any letters and L and Q are already used, we have 4 choices for the second position (E, U, A, or S).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of choices for the third position in the sequence.\nAfter choosing a letter for the second position, we are left with 3 letters that have not been used (excluding L and Q, and the one chosen for the second position).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of distinct sequences.\nThe total number of distinct sequences is the product of the choices for the second and third positions, since these are independent choices. Therefore, the total number of sequences = 4 (choices for the second position) * 3 (choices for the third position).\n\n## Step 6: Perform the multiplication to find the total number of distinct sequences.\nTotal number of sequences = 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"

  "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",
