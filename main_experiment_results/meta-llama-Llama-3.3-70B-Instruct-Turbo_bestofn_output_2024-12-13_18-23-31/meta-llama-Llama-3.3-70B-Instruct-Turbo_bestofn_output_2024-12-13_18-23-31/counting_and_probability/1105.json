    "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row without any restrictions.\nThe total number of ways to arrange 8 people in a row is given by 8!, since there are 8 choices for the first seat, 7 choices for the second seat, and so on, down to 1 choice for the last seat.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of ways 8 people can be seated with John, Wilma, and Paul sitting in three consecutive seats.\nTo calculate this, we treat John, Wilma, and Paul as a single unit, giving us 6 \"people\" to arrange. The number of ways to arrange these 6 \"people\" is 6!. However, within the unit of John, Wilma, and Paul, they can be arranged in 3! different ways. Therefore, the total number of arrangements with John, Wilma, and Paul in consecutive seats is 6! * 3!.\n\n## Step 3: Subtract the number of restricted arrangements from the total number of arrangements to find the number of ways 8 people can be seated with John, Wilma, and Paul not sitting in three consecutive seats.\nThe total number of arrangements without restrictions is 8!, and the number of arrangements with John, Wilma, and Paul in consecutive seats is 6! * 3!. Therefore, the number of ways 8 people can be seated with John, Wilma, and Paul not sitting in three consecutive seats is 8! - (6! * 3!).\n\n## Step 4: Compute the values of 8! and 6! * 3!.\n8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40320.\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\nSo, 6! * 3! = 720 * 6 = 4320.\n\n## Step 5: Subtract the number of restricted arrangements from the total number of arrangements.\n40320 - 4320 = 36000.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36000}$",
    "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row without any restrictions.\nThe total number of ways to arrange 8 people in a row is 8!. This is because there are 8 choices for the first seat, 7 choices for the second seat, 6 choices for the third seat, and so on, until there is only 1 choice for the last seat.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways 8 people can be seated with John, Wilma, and Paul sitting in three consecutive seats.\nTo calculate this, we can treat John, Wilma, and Paul as a single unit, which we'll call JWP. This gives us 6 units in total (JWP and the 5 other people), which can be arranged in 6! ways. However, within the JWP unit, John, Wilma, and Paul can be arranged in 3! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways with John, Wilma, and Paul sitting consecutively is 6! * 3!.\n\n## Step 3: Subtract the number of ways with restrictions from the total number of ways to find the number of ways without John, Wilma, and Paul sitting consecutively.\nThe number of ways without John, Wilma, and Paul sitting consecutively is the total number of ways (8!) minus the number of ways with them sitting consecutively (6! * 3!).\n\n## Step 4: Perform the calculations.\n8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40320.\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n6! * 3! = 720 * 6 = 4320.\nTotal ways without restrictions = 40320.\nTotal ways with restrictions = 4320.\nWays without John, Wilma, and Paul sitting consecutively = 40320 - 4320 = 36000.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36000}$",

This gives us 6 units (the 3-person unit plus the 5 other individuals) to arrange in a row, which can be done in 6! ways. However, within the 3-person unit, John, Wilma, and Paul can arrange themselves in 3! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways for John, Wilma, and Paul to sit consecutively is 6! * 3!.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways John, Wilma, and Paul will not sit consecutively.\nTo find the number of ways John, Wilma, and Paul will not sit consecutively, we subtract the number of ways they can sit consecutively from the total number of arrangements without restrictions. This gives us 8! - (6! * 3!).\n\n## Step 4: Compute the values of 8! and 6! * 3!.\n8! = 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 40320.\n6! = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720.\n3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6.\nSo, 6! * 3! = 720 * 6 = 4320.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the final number of ways John, Wilma, and Paul will not sit consecutively.\n40320 - 4320 = 36000.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36000}$"

  "solution": "The number of all seating arrangements is $8!$. The number of seating arrangements in which John, Wilma and Paul sit next to each other is $6!\\times 3!$. We can arrive at $6!\\times 3!$ by considering John, Wilma and Paul as one person, arranging the ``six'' people (the JWP super-person plus the 5 other people) first, then arranging John, Wilma and Paul.  Thus the number of acceptable arrangements is $$8!-6!\\times 3!=8\\times 7\\times 6! - 6!\\times 3! = (8\\times 7 - 3!)6! = (50)(720)=\\boxed{36000}.$$",
