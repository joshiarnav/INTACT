    "## Step 1: Determine the possible outcomes for Bob's die roll.\nBob can roll a composite number (4, 6), a prime number (2, 3, 5), or a 1. If he rolls a 1, he rolls again.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of Bob eating unsweetened cereal on any given day.\nThe prime numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 3, and 5. So, the probability of rolling a prime number is 3/5, since there are 3 prime numbers out of the 5 possible numbers (excluding 1).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of Bob eating sweetened cereal on any given day.\nThe composite numbers on a six-sided die are 4 and 6. So, the probability of rolling a composite number is 2/5, since there are 2 composite numbers out of the 5 possible numbers (excluding 1).\n\n## Step 4: Determine the expected value of the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal in a non-leap year.\nThere are 365 days in a non-leap year. The expected value of the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal is 365 * (3/5) = 219.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the expected value of the number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal in a non-leap year.\nThe expected value of the number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal is 365 * (2/5) = 146.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal.\nThe difference is 219 - 146 = 73.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{73}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the possible outcomes when Bob rolls the die\nWhen Bob rolls a fair six-sided die, there are 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the action for each outcome\nIf Bob rolls a 1, he rolls again. If he rolls a composite number (4, 6), he eats sweetened cereal. If he rolls a prime number (2, 3, 5), he eats unsweetened cereal.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of eating unsweetened cereal\nThe prime numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 3, and 5. Since the die is fair, the probability of rolling any number is equal. However, because rolling a 1 requires rolling again, the effective outcomes are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Thus, the probability of eating unsweetened cereal (rolling a prime) is 3/5, as there are 3 prime numbers (2, 3, 5) out of the 5 effective outcomes (excluding the 1).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of eating sweetened cereal\nThe composite numbers on a six-sided die are 4 and 6. Using the same logic as in step 3, the probability of eating sweetened cereal is 2/5, since there are 2 composite numbers out of the 5 effective outcomes.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the number of days in a non-leap year\nA non-leap year has 365 days.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the expected number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal\nThe expected number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal is the probability of eating unsweetened cereal multiplied by the number of days in a non-leap year: (3/5) * 365.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the expected number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal\nThe expected number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal is the probability of eating sweetened cereal multiplied by the number of days in a non-leap year: (2/5) * 365.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the difference between the expected number of days of unsweetened and sweetened cereal\nThe difference is calculated as the expected number of days of unsweetened cereal minus the expected number of days of sweetened cereal: (3/5)*365 - (2/5)*365.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the calculation\n(3/5)*365 - (2/5)*365 = (3/5 - 2/5)*365 = (1/5)*365 = 73.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{73}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the outcomes for Bob's die roll\nBob rolls a fair six-sided die. The possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Since Bob rolls again if he rolls a 1, we can disregard the 1 as an outcome.\n\n## Step 2: Classify the outcomes as prime or composite\nFrom the remaining outcomes (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), we classify them as prime or composite. Prime numbers are numbers that have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves. Composite numbers are numbers with more than two divisors. Therefore, the prime numbers in the outcomes are 2, 3, and 5, while the composite numbers are 4 and 6.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of Bob eating unsweetened cereal\nThere are 3 prime numbers (2, 3, 5) out of the 5 possible outcomes (excluding 1). So the probability of Bob eating unsweetened cereal is 3/5.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of Bob eating sweetened cereal\nThere are 2 composite numbers (4, 6) out of the 5 possible outcomes (excluding 1). So the probability of Bob eating sweetened cereal is 2/5.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the expected value of the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal in a non-leap year\nA non-leap year has 365 days. Since the probability of Bob eating unsweetened cereal is 3/5, the expected value of the number of days he eats unsweetened cereal is (3/5) * 365 = 219.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the expected value of the number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal in a non-leap year\nThe probability of Bob eating sweetened cereal is 2/5. So the expected value of the number of days he eats sweetened cereal is (2/5) * 365 = 146.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal\nThe expected value of the difference is the expected value of the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal minus the expected value of the number of days he eats sweetened cereal. So, the difference is 219 - 146 = 73.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{73}$"

  "solution": "Bob is equally likely to end up rolling a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Three of these numbers are prime and two are composite, so there is a $\\frac{3}{5}$ chance he will eat unsweetened cereal and a $\\frac{2}{5}$ chance that he will eat sweetened cereal. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, so the expected value of the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal is $\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot365=219$ and the expected value of the number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal is $\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot365=146$. The difference between 219 days and 146 days is $\\boxed{73}$ days.",
