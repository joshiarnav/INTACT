    "## Step 1: Determine the possible outcomes when rolling two dice\nWhen rolling two dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes, so the total number of outcomes for two dice is 6 * 6 = 36.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of outcomes with no 1's\nTo calculate the number of outcomes with no 1's, we consider that for each die, there are 5 outcomes that are not a 1 (2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Therefore, the total number of outcomes with no 1's is 5 * 5 = 25.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of outcomes with exactly one 1\nThere are two scenarios for getting exactly one 1: the first die is a 1 and the second is not, or the second die is a 1 and the first is not. For the first scenario, there is 1 outcome for the first die (1) and 5 outcomes for the second die (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), giving 1 * 5 = 5 outcomes. The same applies to the second scenario, giving another 5 outcomes. Therefore, the total number of outcomes with exactly one 1 is 5 + 5 = 10.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of outcomes with exactly two 1's\nThere is only 1 outcome where both dice show a 1.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of each outcome\n- The probability of getting no 1's is 25/36.\n- The probability of getting exactly one 1 is 10/36.\n- The probability of getting exactly two 1's is 1/36.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the expected number of 1's\nThe expected number of 1's is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. So, it is (0 * 25/36) + (1 * 10/36) + (2 * 1/36).\n\n## Step 7: Perform the calculation\nExpected number of 1's = (0 * 25/36) + (1 * 10/36) + (2 * 1/36) = 0 + 10/36 + 2/36 = 12/36 = 1/3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$",
    "## Step 1: Define the possible outcomes when rolling two dice\nWhen rolling two standard dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes, resulting in a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes for the pair of dice.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of outcomes with at least one 1\nTo find the expected number of 1's, we first need to identify the outcomes that contain at least one 1. These can be categorized into three cases: (1) exactly one 1, and (2) exactly two 1's.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to get exactly one 1\nThere are two scenarios for getting exactly one 1: the first die shows a 1 and the second does not, or the second die shows a 1 and the first does not. For the first scenario, there is 1 way for the first die to show a 1, and 5 ways for the second die to show a non-1 (since it cannot be 1), resulting in 1 * 5 = 5 outcomes. The same logic applies to the second scenario, resulting in another 5 outcomes. Thus, there are a total of 5 + 5 = 10 outcomes with exactly one 1.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to get exactly two 1's\nThere is exactly 1 way for both dice to show a 1, resulting in 1 outcome with exactly two 1's.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of getting exactly one 1 and exactly two 1's\nThe probability of getting exactly one 1 is the number of outcomes with exactly one 1 divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 10/36. The probability of getting exactly two 1's is 1/36.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the expected number of 1's\nThe expected number of 1's is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products. For exactly one 1, this is 1 * (10/36). For exactly two 1's, this is 2 * (1/36). The expected value E is E = (1 * 10/36) + (2 * 1/36).\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expected value expression\nE = 10/36 + 2/36 = 12/36. This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12. Thus, E = 1/3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$",
    "## Step 1: Define the possible outcomes for a single die roll\nWhen a single standard die is rolled, there are 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling a 1 on a single die\nThe probability of rolling a 1 on a single die is 1 out of 6, since there is only one favorable outcome (rolling a 1) out of the 6 possible outcomes. This probability is 1/6.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the possible outcomes for rolling two dice\nWhen two standard dice are rolled, each die has 6 possible outcomes, resulting in 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes for the pair of dice.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of outcomes with at least one 1\nTo find the expected number of 1's, we first need to consider the cases where 1's appear. These cases are: (1) exactly one die shows a 1, and (2) both dice show a 1.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of outcomes where exactly one die shows a 1\nThere are two scenarios for this: (a) the first die is a 1 and the second is not, and (b) the second die is a 1 and the first is not. For (a), there is 1 favorable outcome for the first die and 5 favorable outcomes for the second die (since it cannot be a 1), resulting in 1 * 5 = 5 favorable outcomes. The same logic applies to (b), resulting in another 5 favorable outcomes. Thus, there are 5 + 5 = 10 outcomes where exactly one die shows a 1.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of outcomes where both dice show a 1\nThere is only 1 outcome where both dice show a 1.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability of each case\nThe probability of exactly one die showing a 1 is the number of outcomes where exactly one die shows a 1 divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 10/36. The probability of both dice showing a 1 is 1/36.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the expected number of 1's\nThe expected number of 1's is calculated by considering the product of the number of 1's in each case and its probability, and then summing these products. For the case where exactly one die shows a 1, the contribution is 1 * (10/36). For the case where both dice show a 1, the contribution is 2 * (1/36). The expected number of 1's is thus (1 * 10/36) + (2 * 1/36).\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the expression for the expected number of 1's\nThe expected number of 1's is (10/36) + (2/36) = 12/36, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$"

  "solution": "The probability of rolling a number other than 1 on one die is $\\frac{5}{6}$, so the probability of rolling zero 1's on two dice is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{36}$. The probability of rolling a 1 on one die is $\\frac{1}{6}$, so the probability of rolling 1's on two dice (for a total of two 1's) is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{36}$. Since the only other possibility is rolling exactly one 1, the probability of rolling one 1 is $1-\\frac{25}{36}-\\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{10}{36}$. We find the expected number of 1's to be $E = \\frac{1}{36} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{10}{36} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{25}{36} \\cdot 0 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
