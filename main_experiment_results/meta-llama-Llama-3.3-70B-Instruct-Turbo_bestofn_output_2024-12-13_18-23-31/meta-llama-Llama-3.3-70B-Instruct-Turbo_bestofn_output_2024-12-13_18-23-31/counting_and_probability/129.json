    "## Step 1: Understand the given equation\nThe given equation is $\\binom{20}{n}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{11}$. We need to find the sum of all integer values $n$ that satisfy this equation.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Pascal's identity\nPascal's identity states that $\\binom{n}{k}+\\binom{n}{k-1}=\\binom{n+1}{k}$. We can use this identity to simplify the given equation.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation using Pascal's identity\nUsing Pascal's identity, we can rewrite $\\binom{21}{11}$ as $\\binom{20}{11}+\\binom{20}{10}$. Substituting this back into the original equation gives $\\binom{20}{n}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{20}{11}+\\binom{20}{10}$.\n\n## Step 4: Cancel out the common term\nWe can cancel out $\\binom{20}{10}$ from both sides of the equation, leaving us with $\\binom{20}{n}=\\binom{20}{11}$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the values of $n$\nSince $\\binom{20}{n}=\\binom{20}{11}$, we know that $n$ can be either $11$ or $9$, because $\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the sum of the values of $n$\nThe sum of the values of $n$ is $11 + 9 = 20$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$",
    "## Step 1: Recall Pascal's Identity\nPascal's Identity states that $\\binom{n}{k} + \\binom{n}{k-1} = \\binom{n+1}{k}$. This identity will be crucial for simplifying the given equation.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Pascal's Identity to the given equation\nGiven the equation $\\binom{20}{n} + \\binom{20}{10} = \\binom{21}{11}$, we can use Pascal's Identity to simplify it. According to Pascal's Identity, $\\binom{20}{10} + \\binom{20}{11} = \\binom{21}{11}$. This implies that for the given equation to hold, $\\binom{20}{n}$ must equal $\\binom{20}{11}$, because both equations equal $\\binom{21}{11}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the value of n\nFrom Step 2, we see that $\\binom{20}{n} = \\binom{20}{11}$. This equality holds when $n = 11$ or $n = 9$, because $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$. Therefore, the possible values for $n$ are $9$ and $11$.\n\n## Step 4: Verify the solutions\nWe need to verify that both $n = 9$ and $n = 11$ satisfy the original equation. For $n = 11$, the equation becomes $\\binom{20}{11} + \\binom{20}{10} = \\binom{21}{11}$, which is true by Pascal's Identity. For $n = 9$, the equation becomes $\\binom{20}{9} + \\binom{20}{10} = \\binom{21}{11}$. Since $\\binom{20}{9} = \\binom{20}{11}$, this also satisfies the equation, as it reduces to the same case as $n = 11$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the sum of all integer values of n\nThe sum of all integer values of $n$ that satisfy the equation is $9 + 11 = 20$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$",
