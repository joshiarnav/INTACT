    "## Step 1: Determine the range of three-digit numbers\nThe smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999. We need to consider all numbers within this range.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of three-digit numbers\nTo find the total count of three-digit numbers, we subtract the lower limit from the upper limit and then add 1 to include both limits. total_numbers = 999 - 100 + 1 = 900.\n\n## Step 3: Find the number of multiples of 5 within the range\nThe first multiple of 5 in the range is 100, and the last is 995. To find how many multiples of 5 there are, we calculate (995 - 100) / 5 + 1 = 180.\n\n## Step 4: Find the number of multiples of 7 within the range\nThe first multiple of 7 in the range is 105, and the last is 994. To find how many multiples of 7 there are, we calculate (994 - 105) / 7 + 1 = 128.\n\n## Step 5: Find the number of multiples of both 5 and 7 (35) within the range\nThe first multiple of 35 in the range is 105, and the last is 980. To find how many multiples of 35 there are, we calculate (980 - 105) / 35 + 1 = 26.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of multiples of 5 or 7\nTotal multiples of 5 or 7 = multiples of 5 + multiples of 7 - multiples of both 5 and 7 = 180 + 128 - 26 = 282.\n\n## Step 7: Subtract the total number of multiples of 5 or 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers to find the numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7\nnumbers_not_multiple_of_5_or_7 = total_numbers - total_multiples_of_5_or_7 = 900 - 282 = 618.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{618}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of three-digit numbers.\nTo find the total number of three-digit numbers, we consider numbers from 100 to 999. Since the first digit can be anything from 1 to 9 (9 choices), the second digit can be anything from 0 to 9 (10 choices), and the third digit can also be anything from 0 to 9 (10 choices), the total number of three-digit numbers is calculated as follows: $9 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 900$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5.\nThe smallest three-digit multiple of 5 is 100, and the largest is 995. To find how many multiples of 5 there are, we calculate the number of steps from 100 to 995 with a step size of 5. This can be calculated using the formula $\\frac{(\\text{last term} - \\text{first term})}{\\text{common difference}} + 1$. Applying this formula: $\\frac{995 - 100}{5} + 1 = \\frac{895}{5} + 1 = 179 + 1 = 180$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7.\nThe smallest three-digit multiple of 7 is 105, and the largest is 994. To find how many multiples of 7 there are, we use a similar approach as with multiples of 5: $\\frac{994 - 105}{7} + 1 = \\frac{889}{7} + 1 = 127 + 1 = 128$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of both 5 and 7 (multiples of 35).\nThe smallest three-digit multiple of 35 is 105, and the largest is 980. To find how many multiples of 35 there are, we apply the formula again: $\\frac{980 - 105}{35} + 1 = \\frac{875}{35} + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of either 5 or 7.\nTo find the total number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of either 5 or 7, we add the number of multiples of 5 and 7 and then subtract the number of multiples of both (to avoid double counting). This gives us $180 + 128 - 26 = 282$.\n\n## Step 6: Subtract the total number of multiples of 5 or 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers to find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7.\nFinally, to find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, we subtract the total number of multiples of 5 or 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers: $900 - 282 = 618$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{618}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of three-digit numbers.\nThe smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999. To find the total count of three-digit numbers, we subtract the lower limit from the upper limit and then add 1. Thus, the total count = 999 - 100 + 1 = 900.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of multiples of 5 within the three-digit range.\nThe first multiple of 5 in the three-digit range is 100, and the last is 995. To find how many multiples of 5 there are, we can use the formula: (last term - first term) / common difference + 1. Applying this, we get (995 - 100) / 5 + 1 = 895 / 5 + 1 = 179 + 1 = 180.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of multiples of 7 within the three-digit range.\nThe first multiple of 7 in the three-digit range is 105, and the last is 994. Using the same formula as before: (994 - 105) / 7 + 1 = 889 / 7 + 1 = 127 + 1 = 128.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of multiples of 35 (the least common multiple of 5 and 7) within the three-digit range.\nThe first multiple of 35 in the three-digit range is 105, and the last is 980. Again, using the formula: (980 - 105) / 35 + 1 = 875 / 35 + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of multiples of 5 or 7.\nThe principle states that to find the total count of numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7, we add the count of multiples of 5 to the count of multiples of 7 and then subtract the count of multiples of their least common multiple (35), because those were counted twice. So, the total count of multiples of 5 or 7 = 180 (multiples of 5) + 128 (multiples of 7) - 26 (multiples of 35) = 308 - 26 = 282.\n\n## Step 6: Subtract the total count of multiples of 5 or 7 from the total count of three-digit numbers.\nTo find the count of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, we subtract the count of multiples of 5 or 7 from the total count of three-digit numbers. So, 900 (total three-digit numbers) - 282 (multiples of 5 or 7) = 618.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{618}$"

  "solution": "It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 5 or 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \\times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 that is a three-digit number is $142 \\times 7 = 994$.  Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7.  The smallest multiple of 5 that is a three-digit number is $20\\times 5 = 100$, and the largest multiple of 5 that is a three digit number is $199\\times 5 =995$. So there are $199-20+1=180$ multiples of 5.\n\nNow notice that we have counted some numbers twice: those multiples of $5\\times7=35$. The smallest multiple of 35 is $3\\times 35 = 105$, the largest multiple of 35 is $28\\times35 =980$. So there are $28-3+1=26$ multiples of 35.\n\nWe have 128 multiples of 7 and 180 multiples of 5, but we count 26 multiples twice.  So, there are a total of $128+180-26 = 282$ distinct three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 (or both).   There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-282=\\boxed{618}$ three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7 nor 5.",
