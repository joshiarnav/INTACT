    "## Step 1: To solve this problem, we first need to understand the geometric configuration and what the question is asking.\nThe question is about the probability that a randomly selected point $P$ inside triangle $ABC$ is closer to vertex $C$ than to either $A$ or $B$.\n\n## Step 2: It's important to recall the properties of triangles and the concept of closest points.\nIn a triangle, the point closest to a vertex (in this case, $C$) than to the other two vertices lies within the region defined by the perpendicular bisectors of the sides adjacent to that vertex.\n\n## Step 3: We must identify the perpendicular bisectors of segments $AC$ and $BC$.\nThe perpendicular bisector of a segment passes through the midpoint of the segment and is perpendicular to it.\n\n## Step 4: For triangle $ABC$, with $AB = 5$, $BC = 4$, and $CA = 3$, it's a right-angled triangle (since $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$, adhering to the Pythagorean theorem).\nGiven that, we can utilize the properties of right triangles and the fact that the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle intersect at the circumcenter.\n\n## Step 5: The circumcenter of a right triangle is the midpoint of the hypotenuse.\nTherefore, the circumcenter (and thus the point where the perpendicular bisectors meet) of triangle $ABC$ is the midpoint of $AB$.\n\n## Step 6: To find the region closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$, we consider the perpendicular bisectors of $AC$ and $BC$.\nHowever, as triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with $\\angle ACB = 90^\\circ$, the perpendicular bisector of $AC$ is parallel to $BC$ and the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ is parallel to $AC$.\n\n## Step 7: The area where $P$ is closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$ is bounded by these bisectors and is a rectangle with sides equal to half the lengths of $AC$ and $BC$.\nThe area of this rectangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the area of triangle $ABC$ to determine the total area in which $P$ can lie.\nThe area of a triangle given its base and height is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot base \\cdot height$. Here, $AC = 3$ and $BC = 4$ can serve as the height and base of triangle $ABC$, so its area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the probability by dividing the area where $P$ is closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$ by the total area of triangle $ABC$.\nThis gives us $\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4}{\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4}$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the fraction to obtain the probability.\n$\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4}{\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$",
    "## Step 1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry of the triangle $ABC$ and the points within it that are closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$.\nThe triangle $ABC$ is a right-angled triangle with sides $AB = 5$, $BC = 4$, and $CA = 3$. We are looking for the probability that a point $P$ selected inside this triangle is closer to $C$ than to either $A$ or $B$.\n\n## Step 2: We should identify the regions within the triangle where $P$ is closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$.\nTo do this, we can use the concept of perpendicular bisectors. The perpendicular bisector of a line segment passes through the midpoint of the segment and is perpendicular to it. Points on one side of the perpendicular bisector are closer to one endpoint of the segment, and points on the other side are closer to the other endpoint.\n\n## Step 3: Draw the perpendicular bisectors of segments $AC$ and $BC$ to divide the triangle into regions based on proximity to the vertices.\nThe perpendicular bisector of $AC$ divides the triangle into points closer to $A$ and points closer to $C$. Similarly, the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ divides the triangle into points closer to $B$ and points closer to $C$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the shape of the region that is closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$.\nThe region closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$ is the area where the two perpendicular bisectors intersect, which is a rectangle with vertices at the midpoints of $AC$ and $BC$ and the intersection points of the perpendicular bisectors with $AB$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the area of the region closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$ and compare it to the total area of triangle $ABC$ to find the probability.\nGiven that $ABC$ is a 3-4-5 right triangle, its area can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. Here, the base and height are 3 and 4, respectively, so the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 4 = 6$ square units.\n\n## Step 6: Find the dimensions and area of the rectangle closer to $C$.\nSince the perpendicular bisectors of $AC$ and $BC$ cut these sides in half, the rectangle's sides are $\\frac{3}{2}$ (half of $AC$) and $\\frac{4}{2} = 2$ (half of $BC$), but considering the geometry of the triangle and the intersection points, the effective area for $P$ being closer to $C$ is actually a smaller region defined by these bisectors and the sides of the triangle.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the area of the smaller region defined by the perpendicular bisectors and the sides of the triangle.\nUpon closer inspection, the region closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$ is actually actually actually half the area of the triangle, not a rectangle as initially considered. This is because the perpendicular bisectors divide the triangle into smaller triangles and rectangles, but the area of interest for being closer to $C$ than $A$ or $B$ specifically is bounded by these bisectors and the triangle's sides, effectively making it half the area of triangle $ABC$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the probability that $P$ is closer to $C$ than to either $A$ or $B$.\nGiven that the area where $P$ is closer to $C$ is half the area of triangle $ABC$, the probability is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$",

In a right-angled triangle, these bisectors have a simple geometric interpretation related to the triangle's sides and angles.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the perpendicular bisector of $AC$ and $BC$.\nThe perpendicular bisector of $AC$ passes through the midpoint of $AC$ and is perpendicular to $AC$. Similarly, the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ passes through the midpoint of $BC$ and is perpendicular to $BC$. Given the right angle at $C$, these bisectors create a region within the triangle that represents all points closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$.\n\n## Step 5: Recognize the shape of the region closer to $C$.\nThe region closer to $C$ is bounded by the perpendicular bisectors of $AC$ and $BC$ and is actually a rectangle with one corner at $C$ and the others at the midpoints of $AC$ and $BC$, extending to the midpoint of $AB$. This is because, in a right triangle, the perpendicular bisectors of the sides intersect at the midpoint of the hypotenuse.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the area of triangle $ABC$.\nThe area $A_{\\triangle ABC}$ of triangle $ABC$ can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle: $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times base \\times height$. In this case, we can use $BC = 4$ as the base and $CA = 3$ as the height, so $A_{\\triangle ABC} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 3 = 6$ square units.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the area of the region closer to $C$.\nThe region closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$ forms a rectangle with sides $\\frac{3}{2}$ (half of $AC$) and $\\frac{4}{2} = 2$ (half of $BC$), so the area of this region $A_{\\text{closer to C}} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 2 = 3$ square units.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the probability.\nThe probability that $P$ is closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$ is the ratio of the area of the region closer to $C$ to the total area of triangle $ABC$. So, the probability $= \\frac{A_{\\text{closer to C}}}{A_{\\triangle ABC}} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$"
