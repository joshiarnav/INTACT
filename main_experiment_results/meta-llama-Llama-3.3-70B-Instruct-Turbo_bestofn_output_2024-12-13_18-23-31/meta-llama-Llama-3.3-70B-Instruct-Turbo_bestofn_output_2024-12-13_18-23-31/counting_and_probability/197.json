    "## Step 1: Determine the probability of an island having treasure and no traps\nThe probability of an island having buried treasure and no traps is given as $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the probability of an island having neither traps nor treasure\nThe probability that an island has neither traps nor treasure is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 islands out of 6 for the treasure\nTo find the number of ways to choose exactly 3 islands out of 6 for the treasure, we use the combination formula: $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Here, $n=6$ (total islands) and $k=3$ (islands with treasure), so the calculation is $C(6, 3) = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of 3 islands having treasure and 3 having neither traps nor treasure\nThe probability of 3 islands having treasure is $(\\frac{1}{4})^3$ and the probability of 3 islands having neither traps nor treasure is $(\\frac{2}{3})^3$. Since these outcomes are independent of each other, we multiply these probabilities.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the combined probability\nThe combined probability of choosing 3 islands with treasure and 3 with neither traps nor treasure out of 6 islands is $C(6, 3) \\times (\\frac{1}{4})^3 \\times (\\frac{2}{3})^3 = 20 \\times \\frac{1}{64} \\times \\frac{8}{27}$.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the multiplication\n$20 \\times \\frac{1}{64} \\times \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{20 \\times 8}{64 \\times 27} = \\frac{160}{1728}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction\n$\\frac{160}{1728} = \\frac{5}{54}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$",

So, $C(6, 3) = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of 3 islands having treasure and 3 islands having neither treasure nor traps\nThe probability of 3 islands having treasure is $(\\frac{1}{4})^3$ and the probability of 3 islands having neither treasure nor traps is $(\\frac{2}{3})^3$. So, the combined probability for this specific arrangement is $(\\frac{1}{4})^3 \\times (\\frac{2}{3})^3$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total probability of encountering exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps\nSince there are 20 different ways to choose which 3 islands out of 6 will have treasure, we multiply the probability of one specific arrangement happening by the number of ways that arrangement can occur. So, the total probability is $20 \\times (\\frac{1}{4})^3 \\times (\\frac{2}{3})^3$.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the multiplication\n$20 \\times (\\frac{1}{4})^3 \\times (\\frac{2}{3})^3 = 20 \\times \\frac{1}{64} \\times \\frac{8}{27} = 20 \\times \\frac{8}{1728} = \\frac{160}{1728}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction\n$\\frac{160}{1728} = \\frac{5}{54}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$",

For our case, $n = 6$ and $k = 3$, so the calculation is $C(6, 3) = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of the desired outcome for the chosen islands\nThe probability that the 3 chosen islands have treasure (and no traps) is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3$, and the probability that the other 3 have neither treasure nor traps is $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total probability of encountering exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps\nThe total probability is the product of the probability of choosing the islands and the probability of the desired outcome for those islands. This gives us $C(6, 3) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = 20 \\times \\frac{1}{64} \\times \\frac{8}{27} = 20 \\times \\frac{8}{1728} = \\frac{160}{1728}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the fraction if necessary\nThe fraction $\\frac{160}{1728}$ can be simplified. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 16, resulting in $\\frac{10}{108}$. Further simplification by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2 gives $\\frac{5}{54}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$"
