    "## Step 1: Define the possible outcomes of a coin flip and their associated probabilities.\nThe coin can land on either heads or tails. The probability of landing on heads is $\\frac{3}{4}$, and the probability of landing on tails is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the gain or loss associated with each outcome.\nA heads flip gains $\\$3$, and a tails flip loses $\\$8$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the expected worth of a coin flip using the formula for expected value.\nThe expected value (E) of a coin flip is calculated as the sum of each outcome's value multiplied by its probability. So, $E = (P(\\text{heads}) \\times \\text{value of heads}) + (P(\\text{tails}) \\times \\text{value of tails})$.\n\n## Step 4: Plug in the values into the expected value formula.\n$E = \\left(\\frac{3}{4} \\times \\$3\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times -\\$8\\right)$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the arithmetic to find the expected value.\n$E = \\left(\\frac{3}{4} \\times \\$3\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times -\\$8\\right) = \\$2.25 - \\$2.00 = \\$0.25$.\n\n## Step 6: Round the expected value to the nearest hundredth as requested in the problem.\nThe expected value is already a decimal and is $\\$0.25$, which is precise to the hundredth place.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.25}$",
