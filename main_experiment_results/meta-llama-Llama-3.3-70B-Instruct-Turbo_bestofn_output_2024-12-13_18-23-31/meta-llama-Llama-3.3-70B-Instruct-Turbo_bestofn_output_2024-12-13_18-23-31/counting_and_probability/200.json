    "## Step 1: Understanding the problem\nThe problem states that the probability of Kim having a math test today is $\\frac{4}{7}$. We need to find the probability that Kim does not have a math test today.\n\n## Step 2: Identifying the relationship between the probabilities\nThe probability of an event happening and the probability of the same event not happening are complementary. This means that if the probability of having a math test is $\\frac{4}{7}$, then the probability of not having a math test can be found by subtracting this probability from 1, since the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes must equal 1.\n\n## Step 3: Calculating the probability of not having a math test\nTo find the probability that Kim does not have a math test, we subtract the probability of having a math test from 1. So, the calculation is $1 - \\frac{4}{7}$.\n\n## Step 4: Performing the calculation\n$1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{7}{7} - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{3}{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given probability\nThe probability that Kim has a math test today is $\\frac{4}{7}$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the rule for finding the probability of the complement of an event\nThe probability of an event not happening is 1 minus the probability of the event happening.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the rule to find the probability that Kim does not have a math test\nTo find the probability that Kim does not have a math test, we subtract the probability of having a math test from 1. So, the probability is $1 - \\frac{4}{7}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression\nTo simplify $1 - \\frac{4}{7}$, we can express 1 as $\\frac{7}{7}$ because $\\frac{7}{7} = 1$. Then, we perform the subtraction: $\\frac{7}{7} - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{7-4}{7} = \\frac{3}{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the probability that Kim does not have a math test today, given that the probability of her having a math test is $\\frac{4}{7}$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the rule of complementary probabilities\nThe probability of an event happening plus the probability of the event not happening is equal to 1. In this case, the probability of Kim having a math test plus the probability of Kim not having a math test equals 1.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the rule of complementary probabilities\nLet $P(H)$ be the probability of Kim having a math test and $P(NH)$ be the probability of Kim not having a math test. We know that $P(H) = \\frac{4}{7}$. According to the rule of complementary probabilities, $P(H) + P(NH) = 1$. Therefore, $\\frac{4}{7} + P(NH) = 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $P(NH)$\nTo find $P(NH)$, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. So, $P(NH) = 1 - \\frac{4}{7}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $P(NH)$\n$P(NH) = 1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{7}{7} - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{3}{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$"
