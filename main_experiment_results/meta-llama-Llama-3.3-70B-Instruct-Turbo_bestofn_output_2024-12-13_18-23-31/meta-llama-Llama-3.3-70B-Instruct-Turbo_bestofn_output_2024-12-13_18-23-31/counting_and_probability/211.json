    "## Step 1: Determine the range of tens digits in the given numbers\nThe tens digits in the numbers from 20 to 69 are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. This gives us a total of 5 different tens digits.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 different integers with different tens digits\nTo have 5 different integers with different tens digits, we can choose one number from each tens group (20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69). There are 10 numbers in each tens group. So, the number of ways to choose one number from each group is $10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 10^5 = 100,000$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 different integers from the given range\nThe total number of integers from 20 to 69 is $69 - 20 + 1 = 50$. We need to choose 5 different integers from these 50. This can be done in $\\binom{50}{5} = \\frac{50!}{5!(50-5)!} = \\frac{50!}{5!45!} = 2,118,760$ ways.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that the 5 integers have different tens digits\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes (choosing 5 integers with different tens digits) divided by the total number of outcomes (choosing any 5 integers). So, the probability is $\\frac{100,000}{2,118,760}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the fraction to get the final probability\n$\\frac{100,000}{2,118,760} = \\frac{100000}{2118760} = \\frac{2500}{52969}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2500}{52969}}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the range of tens digits in the given numbers\nThe tens digits in the numbers from 20 to 69 are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. There are 5 different tens digits.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 numbers without any restriction\nThe total number of integers between 20 and 69, inclusive, is 50. We choose 5 numbers out of these 50, so the total number of ways to choose 5 numbers without any restriction is given by the combination formula: $C(50, 5) = \\frac{50!}{5!(50-5)!}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 numbers with different tens digits\nFor each tens digit (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), there are 10 different units digits (0 through 9). Since we need 5 different tens digits, we can choose one number from each tens group in $10^5$ ways because for each of the 5 tens digits, we have 10 choices.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that the 5 chosen numbers have different tens digits\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes (choosing 5 numbers with different tens digits) divided by the total number of outcomes (choosing any 5 numbers). This probability is $\\frac{10^5}{C(50, 5)}$.\n\n## Step 5: Compute the combination $C(50, 5)$\n$C(50, 5) = \\frac{50!}{5!(50-5)!} = \\frac{50 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times 47 \\times 46}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 2,118,760$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability\nThe probability is $\\frac{10^5}{2,118,760} = \\frac{100,000}{2,118,760}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction to obtain! the final probability\n$\\frac{100,000}{2,118,760} = \\frac{2500}{52969}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2500}{52969}}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the range of tens digits in the given numbers.\nThe tens digits for numbers between 20 and 69 inclusive are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 different integers from the given range without restriction.\nTo choose 5 integers from 50 (since 69 - 20 + 1 = 50), we use combinations. The total number of ways is given by $C(50, 5)$, which equals $\\frac{50!}{5!(50-5)!}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 integers such that each has a different tens digit.\nSince there are 5 different tens digits and we need each of the 5 chosen numbers to have a unique tens digit, we can choose one number from each tens group. There are 10 numbers for each tens digit (e.g., 20-29 for 2, 30-39 for 3, etc.), so for each tens digit, there are 10 choices. Thus, the number of ways to choose 5 numbers with different tens digits is $10^5$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that the 5 chosen integers each have a different tens digit.\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes (Step 3) divided by the total number of outcomes (Step 2). So, the probability is $\\frac{10^5}{C(50, 5)}$.\n\n## Step 5: Compute $C(50, 5)$ to get a numerical value.\n$C(50, 5) = \\frac{50 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times 47 \\times 46}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 2,118,760$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the numerical value of the probability.\nThe probability is $\\frac{10^5}{2,118,760} = \\frac{100,000}{2,118,760}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction to obtain the final probability.\n$\\frac{100,000}{2,118,760} \\approx 0.0472$. However, the problem likely seeks the answer as a simplified fraction or a specific format, but given the format requirements, it seems we need to calculate it exactly as a fraction: $\\frac{100000}{2118760}$ simplifies by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 20, resulting in $\\frac{5000}{105938}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2500}{52969}}$"

  "solution": "In this set of integers, there are 5 tens digits: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.  If 5 integers all have different tens digits, then there must be exactly one integer among the 5 with each tens digit.  Since there are 10 different integers for each tens digit, the number of ways to pick, without regard to order, 5 different integers with different tens digits is $10^5$.  The total number of combinations of 5 integers is $\\binom{50}{5}$.  So the probability that 5 integers drawn all have the different tens digits is $$ \\frac{10^5}{\\binom{50}{5}} = \\frac{100000}{2118760} = \\boxed{\\frac{2500}{52969}}. $$",
