    "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nWe are asked to find the largest prime divisor of the expression $11! + 12!$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the expression\nNotice that $12! = 12 \\times 11!$, so we can factor out $11!$ from the expression: $11! + 12! = 11! + 12 \\times 11! = 11!(1 + 12) = 11! \\times 13$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the prime factors\nThe expression now is $11! \\times 13$. We know that $11!$ is the product of all positive integers up to 11, which includes several prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11). However, since we are looking for the largest prime divisor, we should note that 13 is a prime number and is larger than any prime factor within $11!$.\n\n## Step 4: Conclusion\nGiven that $13$ is a prime number and is larger than any prime factor that could be present within $11!$, it is the largest prime divisor of $11! + 12!$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$",

To simplify this, we notice that 12! = 12 * 11!, so the expression can be rewritten as 11! + 12 * 11!.\n\n## Step 2: Factor out 11! from the expression\nBy factoring out 11!, we get 11!(1 + 12), which simplifies to 11! * 13.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the prime factors of the expression\nThe prime factors of 11! include all prime numbers up to 11, which are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. However, since we are looking for the largest prime divisor of 11! * 13, we need to consider the prime factorization of the entire product.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the largest prime divisor\nGiven that 13 is a prime number and is larger than any prime factor present within 11!, the largest prime divisor of 11! + 12!

  "solution": "Since $12! = 12 \\cdot 11!$, we can examine the sum better by factoring $11!$ out of both parts: $$ 11! + 12! = 11! + 12 \\cdot 11! = 11!(1 + 12) = 11! \\cdot 13. $$Since no prime greater than 11 divides $11!$, $\\boxed{13}$ is the largest prime factor of $11! + 12!$.",
