    "## Step 1: Define the problem and understand what is being asked.\nWe are given a square with vertices at (0,0), (0,2), (2,2), and (2,0), and we need to find the probability that a point $(x,y)$ chosen randomly and uniformly inside this square satisfies the condition $x+y < 3$.\n\n## Step 2: Visualize the square and the condition $x+y < 3$.\nTo visualize the condition $x+y < 3$, we can plot the line $x+y = 3$ on the same coordinate system as the square. This line has a slope of -1 and passes through the point (3,0) and (0,3). The region where $x+y < 3$ is the area below this line.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the area of the square where $x+y < 3$.\nThe line $x+y = 3$ intersects the square at two points: (1,2) and (2,1). This means the area where $x+y \\geq 3$ is a triangle with vertices at (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2). The rest of the square satisfies $x+y < 3$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the entire square.\nThe area of the square is the length of one side squared. Since one side is 2 units long, the area of the square is $2^2 = 4$ square units.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the area of the triangle where $x+y \\geq 3$.\nThe triangle's base and height are both 1 unit (from 1 to 2 on both the x and y axes). The area of a triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$, so the area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ square units.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the area where $x+y < 3$.\nThe area where $x+y < 3$ is the total area of the square minus the area of the triangle where $x+y \\geq 3$. This is $4 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}$ square units.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability that $x+y < 3$.\nThe probability is the ratio of the area where $x+y < 3$ to the total area of the square. This is $\\frac{\\frac{7}{2}}{4} = \\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$",

We need to find the probability that $x+y < 3$.\n\n## Step 2: Visualize the square and the condition $x+y < 3$\nThe square has side length 2, and the condition $x+y < 3$ describes an area within the square. This condition can be graphed as a line $x+y = 3$ and then determining the area below this line that is also within the square.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the area of the entire square\nThe area of the square can be calculated by squaring the side length, which is $2^2 = 4$ square units.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the area where $x+y < 3$\nTo find the area where $x+y < 3$, we first graph the line $x+y = 3$. This line intersects the square at points (1,2) and (2,1), because when $x=1$, $y=2$ and when $x=2$, $y=1$ satisfy $x+y = 3$. The area that does not satisfy $x+y < 3$ is a right triangle with vertices (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2).

The line $x+y = 3$ can be plotted by finding two points on it, such as (0,3) and (3,0), and drawing a line through them. The region that satisfies $x+y < 3$ is below this line.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the area where the condition is satisfied\nThe area of the entire square is $2 \\times 2 = 4$ square units. To find the area where $x+y < 3$, we notice that the line $x+y = 3$ intersects the square at (1,2) and (2,1), because when $x=1$, $y=2$ and when $x=2$, $y=1$ are the points where the line crosses the boundary of the square.
