    "## Step 1: Understand the basic requirement to form a rectangle\nTo enclose a rectangular region, we need to select two horizontal lines and two vertical lines.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose two horizontal lines out of four\nThe number of ways to choose 2 horizontal lines out of 4 is given by the combination formula $C(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $r$ is the number of items to choose, and $!$ denotes factorial. For horizontal lines, this becomes $C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\cdot 2} = 6$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose two vertical lines out of four\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 2 vertical lines out of 4 is $C(4, 2) = 6$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the total number of ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle\nTo find the total number of ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle, we multiply the number of ways to choose two horizontal lines by the number of ways to choose two vertical lines: $6 \\cdot 6 = 36$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$",

To form a rectangle, we must choose two horizontal lines and two vertical lines.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose two horizontal lines out of four.\nThe number of ways to choose two horizontal lines out of four can be calculated using combinations. This can be represented as C(4, 2), which is equal to 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 4! / (2! * 2!) = (4 * 3) / (2 * 1) = 6.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose two vertical lines out of four.\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose two vertical lines out of four is also C(4, 2) = 6.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways to choose two horizontal lines and two vertical lines.\nTo find the total number of ways to choose two horizontal lines and two vertical lines, we multiply the number of ways to choose two horizontal lines by the number of ways to choose two vertical lines.

  "solution": "In order for the four lines to enclose a rectangular region, we must choose two horizontal and two vertical lines.  If we were to choose more than two of one of these types of lines, we would not be able to enclose any region.  We can count independently the number of ways to choose vertical and horizontal lines.  There will be $\\dbinom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose horizontal lines, and the same number of ways to choose two vertical lines.  Since these are independent, there are a total of $6\\cdot 6=\\boxed{36}$ ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle.",
