    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of handshakes without the coach.\nLet's denote the total number of gymnasts as $n$. Each gymnast shakes hands with every other gymnast once, except for herself. This can be represented by the combination formula $C(n, 2)$, which calculates the number of ways to choose 2 gymnasts out of $n$ to form a handshake. The formula for combinations is $C(n, 2) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the coach's handshakes.\nThe coach only shakes hands with gymnasts from her own team. Let's denote the number of gymnasts on the coach's team as $m$. The coach's handshakes will add to the total count of handshakes. Since the coach shakes hands with each gymnast on her team once, the number of handshakes the coach participates in is $m$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation for the total number of handshakes.\nThe total number of handshakes, including those with the coach, is given as 281. This can be represented by the equation: $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + m = 281$.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the constraints for minimizing the coach's handshakes.\nTo minimize $m$, we need to maximize $n$ such that $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ is as close as possible to 281, but still less than or equal to 281, since $m$ cannot be negative.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $n$ to maximize gymnast handshakes.\nWe need to find the largest $n$ such that $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\leq 281$. This involves solving the inequality $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\leq 281$ for $n$.\n\n## Step 6: Test values of $n$.\nLet's test values of $n$ starting from a guess. For instance, if we start with $n = 24$, we get $\\frac{24(24-1)}{2} = 276$, which is close to 281 but still less. This leaves room for $m$ handshakes.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate $m$ based on $n = 24$.\nIf $n = 24$, then $\\frac{24(24-1)}{2} = 276$. Subtracting this from the total handshakes gives $281 - 276 = 5$. So, $m = 5$.\n\n## Step 8: Confirm this is the minimum $m$.\nGiven that $n = 24$ and $m = 5$ satisfy the conditions and we've maximized $n$ to minimize $m$, we have found the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

Since the coach shakes hands with each gymnast on her team once, the number of handshakes the coach participates in is $m$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the given total number of handshakes.\nWe are given that the total number of handshakes, including those with the coach, is 281. So, we can set up the equation: $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + m = 281$. We need to find the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in, which means finding the smallest possible $m$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for the smallest possible $m$.\nTo find the smallest possible $m$, we should look for the largest possible $n$ such that $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ is closest to 281 without exceeding it, because the more handshakes among gymnasts, the fewer handshakes the coach needs to participate in to reach the total of 281.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the largest possible $n$ for gymnast handshakes.\nWe need to solve $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\leq 281$ for the largest possible integer $n$. This means $n^2 - n - 562 \\leq 0$. We can approximate $n$ by solving the quadratic equation $n^2 - n - 562 = 0$ and then testing integers around the solution to find the largest $n$ that still satisfies the inequality.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the quadratic equation.\nThe quadratic equation $n^2 - n - 562 = 0$ can be solved using the quadratic formula: $n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = -562$. Substituting these values in gives $n = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-562)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 2248}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{2249}}{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{2249} \\approx 47.4$, $n \\approx \\frac{1 \\pm 47.4}{2}$. This gives two solutions, but we're interested in the positive one: $n \\approx \\frac{1 + 47.4}{2} \\approx 24.2$. Thus, the largest integer $n$ could be is 24, because we need $n$ to be an integer and the total handshakes to not exceed 281.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total gymnast handshakes for $n = 24$.\nFor $n = 24$, the total number of handshakes among gymnasts is $\\frac{24(24-1)}{2} = \\frac{24 \\times 23}{2} = 276$.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the fewest number of handshakes for the coach.\nGiven that the total number of handshakes is 281 and the gymnasts accounted for 276 handshakes, the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in is $281 - 276 = 5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

This can be represented by the combination formula $C(n, 2) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, which gives the number of handshakes between gymnasts.\n\n## Step 2: Account for the coach's handshakes\nThe coach only shakes hands with gymnasts from her own team. Let's denote the number of gymnasts on the coach's team as $m$. The coach's handshakes will be $m$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation for total handshakes\nThe total number of handshakes, including those with the coach, is given as 281.

  "solution": "The number of gymnasts is some integer $n$, so that the number of gymnast-gymnast handshakes is ${n \\choose 2}$ for some $n$. Also, the coach must participate in an integer $k<n$ number of handshakes. So, ${n \\choose 2} + k = 281$. If we want to minimize $k$, we need the maximal $n$ such that ${n \\choose 2} \\le 281$, which implies $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 281$ or $n^2 - n - 562 \\le 0 $. So, the maximal $n$ is 24.
