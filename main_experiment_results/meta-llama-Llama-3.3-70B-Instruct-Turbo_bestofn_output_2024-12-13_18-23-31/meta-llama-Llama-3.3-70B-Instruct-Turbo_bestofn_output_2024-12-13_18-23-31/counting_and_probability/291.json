    "## Step 1: Understand what the problem is asking for\nThe problem asks us to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $7!$ and $(5!)^2$. To do this, we first need to calculate the values of $7!$ and $(5!)^2$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate $7!$\n$7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate $(5!)^2$\nFirst, calculate $5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$. Then, $(5!)^2 = 120^2 = 14400$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the prime factorization of $7!$ and $(5!)^2$\nFor $7! = 5040$, the prime factorization is $2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7$. For $(5!)^2 = 14400$, the prime factorization is $(2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5)^2 = 2^6 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the common prime factors and their lowest powers\nThe common prime factors between $7!$ and $(5!)^2$ are $2$, $3$, and $5$. The lowest power of $2$ they have in common is $2^4$ (from $7!$), the lowest power of $3$ is $3^2$ (common to both), and the lowest power of $5$ is $5^1$ (from $7!$).\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the GCD using the common prime factors and their lowest powers\nThe GCD is $2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 = 16 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 720$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{720}$",
    "## Step 1: Factorize 7! into its prime factors\nTo find the prime factorization of 7!, we calculate 7! = 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 2^4 x 3^2 x 5 x 7.\n\n## Step 2: Factorize (5!)^2 into its prime factors\nNow, let's calculate the prime factorization of (5!)^2. First, find 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 2^3 x 3 x 5. Then, (5!)^2 = (2^3 x 3 x 5)^2 = 2^6 x 3^2 x 5^2.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the common prime factors between 7! and (5!)^2\nComparing the prime factorizations, the common prime factors are 2, 3, and 5.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the powers of common prime factors that are the smallest between the two factorizations\nFor 2, the smallest power between 7! and (5!)^2 is 2^4 (from 7!). For 3, it's 3^2 (common in both). For 5, it's 5 (from 7!).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the greatest common divisor using the common prime factors and their smallest powers\nThe greatest common divisor (GCD) is the product of these common prime factors raised to their respective smallest powers: 2^4 x 3^2 x 5.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the product\n2^4 = 16, 3^2 = 9, and multiplying these by 5 gives 16 x 9 x 5 = 720.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{720}$",
    "## Step 1: Calculate the value of 7!\nTo find the value of 7!, we multiply all integers from 1 to 7. 7! = 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 5040.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the value of (5!)^2\nFirst, calculate 5! by multiplying all integers from 1 to 5. 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120. Then, square the result to find (5!)^2. (5!)^2 = 120^2 = 14400.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the prime factors of 7! and (5!)^2\nFor 7!, the prime factors are 2^4 \u00d7 3^2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7. For (5!)^2, we first find the prime factors of 5!, which are 2^3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5. Then, squaring these factors gives (2^3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5)^2 = 2^6 \u00d7 3^2 \u00d7 5^2.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the common prime factors between 7! and (5!)^2\nThe common prime factors are 2, 3, and 5. From 7!, we have 2^4, 3^2, and 5. From (5!)^2, we have 2^6, 3^2, and 5^2.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the powers of common prime factors to find the greatest common divisor (GCD)\nFor the GCD, we take the smallest power of each common prime factor. So, we have 2^4 (from 7!), 3^2 (common to both), and 5 (from 7!). Thus, the GCD = 2^4 \u00d7 3^2 \u00d7 5.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the GCD\nGCD = 2^4 \u00d7 3^2 \u00d7 5 = 16 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 5 = 720.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{720}$"
