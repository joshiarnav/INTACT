    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWilliam is guessing random answers for the last 4 questions of the American Mathematics Competition, and each question has 5 answer choices.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of getting a single question wrong\nSince William is guessing randomly and there are 5 answer choices, the probability of getting a single question wrong is $\\frac{4}{5}$, because there are 4 incorrect answers out of the 5 choices.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of getting all 4 questions wrong\nTo find the probability that William gets at least one question right, we first calculate the probability of him getting all 4 questions wrong. Since the guesses are independent, we multiply the probability of getting a single question wrong by itself 4 times: $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4$\n$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = \\frac{4^4}{5^4} = \\frac{256}{625}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of getting at least one question right\nThe probability of getting at least one question right is the complement of getting all questions wrong. This is calculated as $1 - \\frac{256}{625}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $1 - \\frac{256}{625}$\n$1 - \\frac{256}{625} = \\frac{625}{625} - \\frac{256}{625} = \\frac{369}{625}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{369}{625}}$",

Since the guesses are independent, the probability of getting all four questions wrong is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of getting at least one question right\nThe probability of getting at least one question right is the complement of getting all four questions wrong. Therefore, the probability of getting at least one question right is $1 - \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression\nNow, let's simplify $1 - \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4$.\n$1 - \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = 1 - \\frac{256}{625} = \\frac{625 - 256}{625} = \\frac{369}{625}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{369}{625}}$",
