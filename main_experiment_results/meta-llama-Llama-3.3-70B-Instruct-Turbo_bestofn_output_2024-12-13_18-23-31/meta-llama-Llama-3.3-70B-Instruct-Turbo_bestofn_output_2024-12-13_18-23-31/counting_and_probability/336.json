    "## Step 1: To find the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3, we need to consider the pattern of multiples of 7.\nMultiples of 7 follow a pattern where the last digit repeats every 10 numbers (7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, and then it repeats).\n\n## Step 2: Identify the first multiple of 7 that ends with the digit 3.\nThe first multiple of 7 that ends with the digit 3 is 63.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the pattern for multiples of 7 that end in 3.\nSince 63 is the first multiple and the pattern of the last digit of multiples of 7 repeats every 10 numbers, we can find the next multiple by adding 10 to the previous multiple's position in the cycle (not the multiple itself). However, to maintain the ending digit of 3, we actually look for a pattern in the multiples themselves. Given that 7*9 = 63, the next number following this pattern would be 7*(9+10) because adding 10 to the multiplier brings us to the next number ending in 3 due to the cyclical nature of the last digit in multiples of 7.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3.\nStarting from 63, we increment by 70 (which is 7*10) to find the next number that ends in 3 because every 10th multiple of 7 will have the same ending digit due to the multiplication properties. So, we check 63, 133, 203, and so on, until we reach a number that is close to 1000.\n\n## Step 5: List out the sequence to ensure accuracy.\nStarting with 63, we add 70 to get the next number: 63, 133, 203, 273, 343, 413, 483, 553, 623, 693, 763, 833, 903, 973. We stop here because the next number, 1043, is greater than 1000.\n\n## Step 6: Count the total number of multiples of 7 that end with the digit 3 and are less than 1000.\nCounting the numbers in the sequence: 63, 133, 203, 273, 343, 413, 483, 553, 623, 693, 763, 833, 903, 973, we find there are 14 such numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$",
    "## Step 1: To find the positive multiples of 7 that end with the digit 3, we need to consider the pattern of multiples of 7.\nMultiples of 7 follow a sequence where each number is 7 greater than the previous number. We are looking for numbers in this sequence that end in 3.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the first multiple of 7 that ends with the digit 3.\nThe first few multiples of 7 are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63. We see that 63 is the first multiple of 7 that ends with the digit 3.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the pattern for multiples of 7 that end with the digit 3.\nSince 63 is the first multiple and we are looking for numbers less than 1000, we need to find how the sequence of multiples of 7 that end in 3 continues. The next number would be 63 + 70 (since 10 is the base for our decimal system and we're dealing with the last digit), but we are specifically looking for multiples of 7, so we consider the sequence in terms of multiples of 7. The pattern will repeat every 10 multiples of 7 because the last digit of a multiple of 7 repeats in a cycle due to the properties of our decimal system.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3.\nGiven that 63 is the first, we need to find how many numbers follow this pattern up to 1000. The sequence of multiples of 7 that end in 3 would be 63, 133, 203, ..., up to a number less than 1000. To find out how many such numbers exist, we can set up an inequality to solve for n, where the nth term is less than 1000. The sequence can be expressed as 63 + 70n (since each subsequent number that ends in 3 and is a multiple of 7 is 70 more than the previous), and we want 63 + 70n < 1000.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the inequality 63 + 70n < 1000 for n.\nSubtract 63 from both sides to get 70n < 937. Then, divide both sides by 70 to solve for n: n < 937 / 70.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the division to find the value of n.\nn < 13.38 (approximately). Since n must be an integer (because it represents the number of terms in the sequence), the largest value of n that satisfies the inequality is 13.\n\n## Step 7: Interpret the result.\nThis means there are 14 numbers in the sequence (since we start counting from 0), but because we are counting from the first occurrence (63), we actually have 14 numbers including 63.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$",
    "## Step 1: To find the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3, we need to consider the properties of multiples of 7 and the pattern of their last digits.\nMultiples of 7 follow a cyclic pattern in their last digit, which repeats every 10 numbers (7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, and then the cycle repeats).\n\n## Step 2: We need to identify which multiples of 7 end with the digit 3.\nFrom the pattern, we observe that the multiples of 7 that end with the digit 3 are those of the form 10n + 3, where n is an integer, and are divisible by 7. The first few multiples of 7 that end with 3 are 63, 133, 203, etc.\n\n## Step 3: Next, let's find the smallest and largest multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3.\nThe smallest multiple is 63 (7 * 9), and the largest multiple less than 1000 is 993 (7 * 141).\n\n## Step 4: Now, we need to determine the number of terms in the sequence of multiples of 7 that end with the digit 3 and are less than 1000.\nThe sequence starts with 63 and ends with 993. We can express these multiples as 7 * (10n + 9), where n = 0, 1, 2, ..., until 10n + 9 = 141 (since 7 * 141 = 987, which is the closest multiple of 7 less than 993 that ends in a 7, but we need the last multiple ending in 3, which is 993 or 7 * 141 + 6, implying the sequence ends at n = 14 because 7 * (10 * 14 + 9) = 7 * 149 = 1043, which exceeds 1000, so we actually consider up to 7 * (10 * 13 + 9) = 7 * 139 = 973, and then 7 * 141 + 6 = 993, meaning we look for multiples up to 141, but counting only those ending in 3).\n\n## Step 5: We calculate the number of multiples based on the identified pattern and range.\nThe number of multiples can be calculated by finding how many numbers of the form 10n + 9 are there between 9 (for 63) and 141 (for 993), inclusive, since every 10th number will produce a multiple of 7 ending in 3 when multiplied by 7. Given the sequence and the fact that we are essentially counting in steps of 10 (due to the 10n pattern), we count the multiples directly: 63, 133, 203, ..., 993. This pattern shows that for every increment of 10 in the multiplier (n), we get a multiple of 7 ending in 3. From 63 to 993, we count the multiples directly, which can also be calculated by considering the difference in the multipliers (141 - 9)/10 + 1, accounting for the inclusive range and the step of 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$"

  "solution": "Listing the first 10 multiples of 7, which are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, we see that the only positive multiples of 7 that end in 3 are those that are the product of 7 and a number that ends in 9.  Therefore, the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3 are $7\\cdot 9 = 63$, $7\\cdot 19= 133$, $7\\cdot 29 = 203$, . . .  Notice that we can get from each to the next by adding $7\\cdot 10 = 70$, so our multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 are 63, 133, 203, . . ., 903, 973.  The last one is 910 more than the first. Since $910/70=13$, we see that we have taken 13 steps of 70 to get from the first number in the list to the last. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{14}$ numbers in the list.",
