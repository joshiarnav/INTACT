    "## Step 1: List the first seven prime numbers\nThe first seven prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the conditions for the sum to be even\nFor the sum of two numbers to be even, either both numbers must be even or both numbers must be odd. Since there is only one even prime number in the list (2), the only way to get an even sum with two distinct numbers is if both numbers are odd.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose two distinct odd prime numbers from the list\nThere are 6 odd prime numbers in the list. The number of ways to choose 2 distinct odd prime numbers from 6 is given by the combination formula: $C(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways to choose two distinct prime numbers from the list\nThere are 7 prime numbers in total. The number of ways to choose 2 distinct prime numbers from 7 is given by the combination formula: $C(7, 2) = \\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that the sum is even\nThe probability that the sum is even is the number of favorable outcomes (choosing two odd primes) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (choosing any two distinct primes). So, the probability is $\\frac{15}{21}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the fraction\nThe fraction $\\frac{15}{21}$ can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. Thus, $\\frac{15}{21} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$",

Since there is only one even prime number (2) among the first seven prime numbers, the condition of both being even is very restrictive, leaving the feasible scenario where both selected numbers are odd for the sum to be even.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of distinct pairs possible from the seven prime numbers\nTo calculate the total number of distinct pairs from seven numbers, we use the combination formula because the order in which we select the numbers does not matter. The formula for combinations is \\(C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial. For selecting 2 numbers out of 7, the calculation is \\(C(7, 2) = \\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \\frac{7*6}{2} = 21\\).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of pairs of odd prime numbers\nSince there are 6 odd prime numbers among the first seven primes (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17), we calculate the number of distinct pairs of these odd numbers using the combination formula: \\(C(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6*5}{2} = 15\\).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of selecting two distinct numbers whose sum is an even number\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. From step 4, we have 15 favorable outcomes (pairs of odd numbers), and from step 3, we have a total of 21 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is \\( \\frac{15}{21} \\).\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the fraction\nThe fraction \\( \\frac{15}{21} \\) can be simplified by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 15 and 21. The GCD of 15 and 21 is 3. Dividing both numerator and denominator by 3 gives \\( \\frac{5}{7} \\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$",

So, $C(7, 2) = \\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21$.\n\n## Step 5:  Calculate the number of ways to select two distinct numbers such that their sum is even.\nTo have an even sum, we can either pick two even numbers or two odd numbers. Since there's only one even prime number (2), the number of ways to choose two even numbers is 1 (which is $C(1, 2) = 0$ because we cannot choose 2 distinct even numbers from a set of 1). For odd numbers, we can choose 2 from the 6 available odd primes, so $C(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15$. Thus, the total number of favorable outcomes is 0 (for choosing two evens) + 15 (for choosing two odds) = 15.\n\n## Step 6:  Calculate the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers selected at random is even.\nThe probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes. So, the probability = $\\frac{15}{21}$.\n\n## Step 7:  Simplify the fraction to express the probability in its simplest form.\nThe fraction $\\frac{15}{21}$ can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. Thus, $\\frac{15}{21} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$"

  "solution": "The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2. There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum IS even is $1-\\frac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",
