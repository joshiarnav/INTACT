    "To form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats, we can break the process down into two steps: choosing the Republicans and choosing the Democrats.\n\nStep 1: Choosing the Republicans\nWe have 8 Republicans, and we want to choose 3 of them. This is a combination problem, because the order in which we choose the Republicans does not matter. The number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8 is given by the combination formula:\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!)\n= 8! / (3! * 5!)\n= (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n= 56\n\nStep 2: Choosing the Democrats\nWe have 6 Democrats, and we want to choose 2 of them. This is also a combination problem. The number of ways to choose 2 Democrats from 6 is given by the combination formula:\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!)\n= 6! / (2! * 4!)\n= (6 * 5) / (2 * 1)\n= 15\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of ways to form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats. Since these choices are independent, we multiply the number of ways to choose the Republicans by the number of ways to choose the Democrats:\nTotal number of ways = C(8, 3) * C(6, 2)\n= 56 * 15\n= 840\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{840}$",
    "To form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8 and 2 Democrats from 6.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8. This can be done using the combination formula, $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $r$ is the number of items to choose, and $!$ denotes factorial.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8 is $\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3!5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56$.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 Democrats from 6. Using the combination formula, $\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6!}{2!4!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15$.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats by multiplying the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats.\n\nTotal number of ways = (number of ways to choose 3 Republicans) \u00d7 (number of ways to choose 2 Democrats) = 56 \u00d7 15 = 840.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{840}$",
    "To form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats, we first need to select the Republicans and then the Democrats.\n\nStep 1: Selecting the Republicans\nWe have 8 Republicans and we need to choose 3 of them. This is a combination problem, because the order in which we choose the Republicans does not matter. The number of ways to choose 3 Republicans out of 8 is given by the combination formula: \n\\[C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\]\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. For the Republicans:\n\\[C(8, 3) = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3!5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{336}{6} = 56\\]\n\nStep 2: Selecting the Democrats\nWe have 6 Democrats and we need to choose 2 of them. Using the same combination formula:\n\\[C(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6!}{2!4!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\\]\n\nStep 3: Finding the total number of ways to form the subcommittee\nThe total number of ways to form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats is the product of the number of ways to choose the Republicans and the number of ways to choose the Democrats:\n\\[Total\\ ways = C(8, 3) \\times C(6, 2) = 56 \\times 15 = 840\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{840}$"
