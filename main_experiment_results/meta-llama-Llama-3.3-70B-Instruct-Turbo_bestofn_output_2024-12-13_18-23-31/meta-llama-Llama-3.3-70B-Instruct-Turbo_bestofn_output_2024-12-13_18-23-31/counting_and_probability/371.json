    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are tasked with finding the number of ways to distribute 5 indistinguishable balls into 3 distinguishable boxes.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the method for solution\nSince the balls are indistinguishable, we can use a \"stars and bars\" method to solve this problem. This method involves visualizing the distribution of balls into boxes as a sequence of stars (representing the balls) and bars (representing the divisions between the boxes).\n\n## Step 3: Apply the stars and bars method\nWe have 5 stars (for the 5 balls) and 2 bars (to divide the balls into 3 groups, representing the 3 boxes). The total number of arrangements of these stars and bars can be found by calculating the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 7 (5 stars + 2 bars) for the bars.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of arrangements\nThe number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 7 is given by the combination formula: C(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7-2)!) = 7! / (2! * 5!) = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1) = 21.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks for the number of ways to distribute 5 indistinguishable balls into 3 distinguishable boxes.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the method to solve the problem\nThis is a classic problem of distributing indistinguishable objects into distinguishable containers, which can be solved using the concept of \"stars and bars\" or combinations with repetition.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the stars and bars method\nThe stars and bars method involves visualizing the distribution of balls into boxes as a sequence of stars (representing the balls) and bars (representing the divisions between the boxes). For 5 balls and 3 boxes, we have 5 stars and 2 bars (since 3 boxes require 2 divisions). The number of ways to arrange these stars and bars is given by the formula for combinations with repetition, which is (n+k-1) choose (k-1), where n is the number of objects (balls) and k is the number of containers (boxes).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the combinations with repetition\nHere, n = 5 (the number of balls) and k = 3 (the number of boxes). Applying the formula (n+k-1) choose (k-1), we get (5+3-1) choose (3-1) = 7 choose 2.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate 7 choose 2\nThe formula for \"n choose k\" is n! / (k!(n-k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. So, 7 choose 2 = 7! / (2!(7-2)!) = 7! / (2!5!) = (7*6) / (2*1) = 21.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$",

  "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of balls in the different boxes.\n\nThere are $3$ ways to arrange the balls as $(5,0,0)$ (specifically, box 1 can have 5, box 2 can have 5, box 3 can have 5).\n\nThere are $3! = 6$ to arrange $(4,1,0)$ and $3! = 6$ ways to arrange $(3,2,0)$; in each case, we must choose one of the 3 boxes to have the largest number of balls, and also one of the remaining two boxes to be left empty.\n\nHowever, there are only $3$ ways to arrange $(3,1,1)$, and $3$ ways to arrange $(2,2,1)$; in each case, we must choose one box to have the `different' number of balls (3 in the $(3,1,1)$ case and 1 in the $(2,2,1)$ case).\n\nThis gives a total of $3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = \\boxed{21}$ arrangements.",
