    "## Step 1: Identify the total number of friends Cara has.\nCara has 5 friends sitting at the circular table with her.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the concept of pairs in the context of the problem.\nSince Cara needs to be sitting between two people, we are looking to find all possible combinations of 2 friends from the total of 5 that Cara could be seated between.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the combination formula to find the number of possible pairs.\nThe formula for combinations, where order does not matter (as is the case here since the pair AB is the same as BA), is given by $C(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of combinations of 2 friends from 5.\nHere, n = 5 (total friends) and r = 2 (friends to choose for a pair). Plugging these values into the combination formula gives $C(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the combination formula with the given values.\nSimplifying $C(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!}$ gives $C(5, 2) = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 3!}$. The $3!$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving $C(5, 2) = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1}$.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the arithmetic to get the final answer.\nCalculating $C(5, 2) = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1}$ gives $C(5, 2) = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the total number of friends Cara has.\nCara is sitting with 5 friends.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between.\nSince Cara can be sitting between any two of her 5 friends, we can calculate the number of possible pairs by using the combination formula. The formula for combinations is given by $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $r$ is the number of items to choose, and $!$ denotes factorial. In this case, we want to choose 2 friends out of 5 to sit next to Cara.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the combination formula to find the number of possible pairs.\nUsing the combination formula, the number of possible pairs of friends Cara could be sitting between is $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the total number of friends Cara has.\nCara is sitting with 5 friends at a circular table.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of choices for the person on Cara's left.\nSince Cara can be sitting between any two of her 5 friends, there are 5 choices for the person on her left.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of choices for the person on Cara's right.\nAfter choosing the person on Cara's left, there are 4 remaining friends who could be on her right.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of pairs considering the circular arrangement.\nHowever, because the table is circular and the arrangement is considered the same if everyone shifts positions in the same direction, we need to account for this by not double counting pairs. The initial calculation might consider each pair twice (once in either order), but given the circular nature and that we're looking for pairs without regard to order (i.e., A on the left and B on the right is the same as B on the left and A on the right in a circular context), we need to adjust our calculation to reflect choosing 2 people out of 5 without considering order.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the combination formula to find the number of pairs.\nThe formula for combinations, where order does not matter, is given by C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. For Cara's situation, we want to find C(5, 2), which represents choosing 2 friends out of 5 to sit between, without regard to order.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate C(5, 2).\nC(5, 2) = 5! / [2!(5-2)!] = (5*4*3*2*1) / [(2*1)*(3*2*1)] = (5*4) / (2*1) = 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"

  "solution": "The number of pairs of neighbors for Cara actually has nothing to do with the shape of the table she is sitting at. That is, all that matters is that she has 5 friends and two of them will be her neighbors. There are ${5 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{10}$ pairs of friends that she can thus sit between.",
