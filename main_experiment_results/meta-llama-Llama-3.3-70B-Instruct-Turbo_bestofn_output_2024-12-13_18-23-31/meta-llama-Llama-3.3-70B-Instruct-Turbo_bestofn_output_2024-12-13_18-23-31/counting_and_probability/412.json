    "## Step 1: To determine the number of distinct triangles that can be formed by connecting three different vertices of a cube, we first need to establish the total number of vertices a cube has.\nA cube has 8 vertices.\n\n## Step 2: Since a triangle is formed by connecting 3 vertices, we need to calculate the number of combinations of 3 vertices out of the 8 available.\nThis is a combination problem, not permutation, because the order in which the vertices are chosen does not matter.\n\n## Step 3: The formula for calculating the number of combinations is given by C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, the product of all positive integers up to that number.\nFor our problem, n = 8 (total vertices) and k = 3 (vertices needed to form a triangle).\n\n## Step 4: Plugging the values into the combination formula, we get C(8, 3) = 8! / [3!(8-3)!].\nCalculating the factorials: 8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, 3! = 3 * 2 * 1, and (8-3)! = 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression by calculating the factorials and simplifying the fraction.\n8! = 40320, 3! = 6, and 5! = 120.\nSo, C(8, 3) = 40320 / (6 * 120) = 40320 / 720.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the final division to find the number of distinct triangles.\n40320 / 720 = 56.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{56}$",
