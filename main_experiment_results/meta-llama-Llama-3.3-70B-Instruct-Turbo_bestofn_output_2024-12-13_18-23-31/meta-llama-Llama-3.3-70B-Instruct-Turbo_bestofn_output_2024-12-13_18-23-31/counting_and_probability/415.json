    "## Step 1: Identify the total number of outcomes\nThere are 150 numbers in the bag, so there are a total of 150 possible outcomes when selecting a number.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of perfect squares\nTo find the number of perfect squares from 1 to 150, we need to find the largest perfect square less than or equal to 150. Since $12^2 = 144$ and $13^2 = 169$, the largest perfect square less than or equal to 150 is $12^2$. Thus, there are 12 perfect squares.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of perfect cubes\nTo find the number of perfect cubes from 1 to 150, we need to find the largest perfect cube less than or equal to 150. Since $5^3 = 125$ and $6^3 = 216$, the largest perfect cube less than or equal to 150 is $5^3$. Thus, there are 5 perfect cubes.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the overlap of perfect squares and perfect cubes\nThere are numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes, which are 6th powers. From 1 to 150, the 6th powers are $1^6 = 1$ and $2^6 = 64$. So, there are 2 numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of perfect squares and perfect cubes\nTo find the total number of perfect squares and perfect cubes, we add the number of perfect squares and perfect cubes and then subtract the overlap to avoid double counting. So, the total number is $12 + 5 - 2 = 15$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of not selecting a perfect square or a perfect cube\nThe probability of selecting a number that is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube is $1 - \\frac{15}{150} = \\frac{135}{150} = \\frac{9}{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify perfect squares from 1 to 150\nTo find the perfect squares from 1 to 150, we need to identify the numbers that can be expressed as $n^2$ where $n$ is an integer. The perfect squares in this range are $1^2=1$, $2^2=4$, $3^2=9$, $4^2=16$, $5^2=25$, $6^2=36$, $7^2=49$, $8^2=64$, $9^2=81$, $10^2=100$, $11^2=121$, and $12^2=144$. There are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150.\n\n## Step 2: Identify perfect cubes from 1 to 150\nTo find the perfect cubes from 1 to 150, we need to identify the numbers that can be expressed as $n^3$ where $n$ is an integer. The perfect cubes in this range are $1^3=1$, $2^3=8$, $3^3=27$, $4^3=64$, and $5^3=125$. There are 5 perfect cubes from 1 to 150.\n\n## Step 3: Identify numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes\nWe notice that $1$ and $64$ are both perfect squares and perfect cubes. These numbers should not be counted twice when calculating the total number of perfect squares and perfect cubes.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of perfect squares and perfect cubes\nThe total number of perfect squares and perfect cubes, without counting duplicates, is $12 + 5 - 2 = 15$. This is because we have 12 perfect squares, 5 perfect cubes, and we subtract 2 to account for the duplicates ($1$ and $64$).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of selecting a number that is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube\nThe total number of integers from 1 to 150 is 150. The probability of selecting a number that is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube is calculated by subtracting the probability of selecting a perfect square or a perfect cube from 1. This can be expressed as $1 - \\frac{15}{150}$. Simplifying, we get $1 - \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{9}{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the total number of outcomes\nThe total number of outcomes is the total count of numbers from 1 to 150, inclusive, which is 150.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of perfect squares\nTo find the number of perfect squares from 1 to 150, we need to find the largest perfect square less than or equal to 150. Since $12^2 = 144$ and $13^2 = 169$, the largest perfect square less than or equal to 150 is $12^2$. Thus, there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of perfect cubes\nTo find the number of perfect cubes from 1 to 150, we need to find the largest perfect cube less than or equal to 150. Since $5^3 = 125$ and $6^3 = 216$, the largest perfect cube less than or equal to 150 is $5^3$. Thus, there are 5 perfect cubes from 1 to 150.\n\n## Step 4: Identify overlapping numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes\nNumbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes must be 6th powers. From 1 to 150, the numbers that are 6th powers are $1^6 = 1$ and $2^6 = 64$. Thus, there are 2 numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of perfect squares and perfect cubes, accounting for overlap\nThe total count of numbers that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes (or both) is the sum of the counts of perfect squares and perfect cubes minus the count of numbers that are both, to avoid double counting. This gives $12 + 5 - 2 = 15$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of selecting a number that is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube\nThe probability of selecting a number that is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube is calculated by subtracting the probability of selecting a number that is a perfect square or a perfect cube from 1. The probability of selecting a perfect square or a perfect cube is the count of such numbers divided by the total count of numbers, which is $\\frac{15}{150}$. Thus, the probability of selecting a number that is neither is $1 - \\frac{15}{150}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the probability fraction\n$1 - \\frac{15}{150} = \\frac{150}{150} - \\frac{15}{150} = \\frac{135}{150}$. This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15. Thus, $\\frac{135}{150} = \\frac{9}{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$"

  "solution": "It is easier to count the number of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. We see there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150, namely $1^{2}, 2^{2}, \\ldots, 12^{2}$, and there are 5 perfect cubes, namely $1^{3}, \\ldots, 5^{3}$. Then notice there are two repetitions, $1^{6} =1^2 = 1^3 = 1$ and $2^{6} = 8^2 = 4^3 = 64$. So there is a total of $12+5-2=15$ integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Thus, we get $150-15=135$ integers from 1 to 150 that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes. So the probability that we select such a number is $\\frac{135}{150} = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",
