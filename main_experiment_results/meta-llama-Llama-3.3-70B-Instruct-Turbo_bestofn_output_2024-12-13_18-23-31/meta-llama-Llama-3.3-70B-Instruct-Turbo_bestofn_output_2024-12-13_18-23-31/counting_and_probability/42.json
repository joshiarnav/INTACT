    "## Step 1: Understanding the problem\nWe need to find the number of different positive, four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the total permutations without considering repetition\nIf all digits were unique, the total number of permutations for a four-digit number would be 4! (4 factorial), since there are 4 choices for the first digit, 3 for the second, 2 for the third, and 1 for the last.\n\n## Step 3: Accounting for the repetition of the digit 2\nSince the digit 2 is repeated twice, we must divide the total permutations by the factorial of the number of times it is repeated, which is 2!. This is because for every unique permutation, there are 2! ways to arrange the two 2s that result in the same number.\n\n## Step 4: Accounting for the repetition of the digit 9\nSimilarly, the digit 9 is also repeated twice. So, we must also divide by 2! to account for the arrangements of the two 9s that result in the same number.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the final number of permutations\nThe formula to find the number of permutations with repetitions is: total permutations / (repetitions of each digit!). So, it's 4! / (2! * 2!). Calculating this gives: 4! / (2! * 2!) = 24 / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of digits to arrange\nWe have 4 digits in total: 2, 2, 9, and 9.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the repeating digits\nAmong these digits, 2 is repeated twice and 9 is also repeated twice.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of arrangements\nTo calculate the total number of arrangements of these digits, we'll use the formula for permutations of items where some items repeat. The formula is the total number of digits factorial, divided by the product of each repeating digit's factorial. In this case, it's 4! / (2! * 2!).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the factorial of each number\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24,\n2! = 2 * 1 = 2,\nand another 2! = 2 * 1 = 2.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of arrangements\nTotal arrangements = 4! / (2! * 2!) = 24 / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the digits to be used and their repetitions.\nThe digits to be used are 2, 2, 9, and 9, indicating that the digit 2 repeats twice and the digit 9 also repeats twice.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of positions to fill in the integer.\nSince we are forming four-digit integers, there are 4 positions to fill.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of arrangements considering the repetitions.\nTo calculate the total number of arrangements of these digits, we start with the total number of arrangements if all digits were unique, which is 4! (4 factorial). However, because the digit 2 repeats twice and the digit 9 also repeats twice, we must divide by the factorials of their counts to account for the overcounting of arrangements that only differ by the swapping of identical digits.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the formula for permutations with repetitions.\nThe formula for permutations of a set of objects with repetitions is n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!), where n is the total number of objects, and r1, r2, ..., rk are the counts of each repeated object. In this case, n = 4 (total digits), r1 = 2 (for the two 2s), and r2 = 2 (for the two 9s). So, the calculation is 4! / (2! * 2!).\n\n## Step 5: Perform the calculation.\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24, and 2! * 2! = (2 * 1) * (2 * 1) = 4. Thus, 24 / 4 = 6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"

  "solution": "We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting. That is, if we had 4 distinct digits, there would be $4! = 24$ orderings. However, we must divide by 2! once for the repetition of the digit 2, and divide by 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digit were different we would have twice as many orderings). So, our answer is $\\frac{4!}{2!\\cdot 2!} = 2 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{6}$.",
