    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the exclusion criteria\nWe need to find the number of three-digit numbers where we exclude all numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent. This means the numbers to exclude follow the pattern ABA, where A and B are different digits.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the total number of three-digit numbers without any exclusions\nThe smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999. Therefore, the total number of three-digit numbers without any exclusions is 999 - 100 + 1 = 900.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of three-digit numbers to exclude\nFor the pattern ABA, there are 9 choices for A (since it cannot be 0) and, once A is chosen, there are 9 choices for B (since B must be different from A). This gives us 9 * 9 = 81 numbers to exclude.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final number of three-digit numbers left after exclusion\nSubtract the number of excluded numbers from the total number of three-digit numbers: 900 - 81 = 819.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{819}$",
    "## Step 1:  Identify the total number of three-digit numbers without any restrictions.\nTo find the total number of three-digit numbers, we consider that the first digit cannot be 0, so there are 9 choices for the first digit (1-9), and 10 choices for each of the second and third digits (0-9). Therefore, the total number of three-digit numbers is $9 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 900$.\n\n## Step 2:  Determine the number of three-digit numbers with exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent.\nFor a three-digit number with exactly two digits the same but not adjacent, the first and third digits must be the same, and the second digit must be different. There are 9 choices for the first digit (since it cannot be 0), and once the first digit is chosen, the third digit is determined (to be the same as the first). Then, there are 9 choices for the second digit (since it must be different from the first digit). Therefore, the number of such numbers is $9 \\times 9 = 81$.\n\n## Step 3:  Calculate the number of three-digit numbers left after excluding the numbers with exactly two digits the same but not adjacent.\nThe number of three-digit numbers left after excluding the specified numbers is found by subtracting the number of excluded numbers from the total number of three-digit numbers: $900 - 81 = 819$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{819}$",

So, the total number of three-digit numbers is 999 - 100 + 1 = 900.\n\n## Step 2:  Determine the pattern to exclude, which is having exactly two digits the same but not adjacent.\nFor a three-digit number, the pattern to exclude is where the first and last digits are the same, but the middle digit is different. This can be represented as ABA, where A and B are different digits.\n\n## Step 3:  Calculate the number of three-digit numbers following the pattern ABA.\nTo calculate the numbers following the pattern ABA, we consider the following:\n- The first digit (A) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0 for a three-digit number), giving us 9 choices.\n- The last digit (A) must be the same as the first, so there's 1 choice once the first digit is decided.\n- The middle digit (B) can be any digit from 0 to 9 except the digit chosen for A, giving us 9 choices (since one digit is already chosen for A).\n\n## Step 4:  Calculate the total number of ABA pattern numbers.\nThe total number of ABA pattern numbers is 9 choices for A * 9 choices for B = 81.\n\n## Step 5:  Subtract the number of excluded patterns from the total number of three-digit numbers.\nTo find the number of three-digit numbers left after excluding the ABA pattern, subtract the number of ABA patterns from the total number of three-digit numbers: 900 - 81.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{819}$"

  "solution": "The only three digit numbers which are ruled out are numbers of the form $ABA$, where A and B are different digits. There are 9 ways to choose A, since it can't be 0, and once A has been chosen there are 9 ways to choose B. Since there are $9\\cdot10\\cdot10=900$ total three digit numbers, and $9\\cdot9=81$ numbers which aren't valid, there are $900-81=\\boxed{819}$ valid numbers.",
