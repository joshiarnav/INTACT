    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and constraints\nThe problem asks for the probability that a randomly selected point $(x, y)$ within the given constraints $0 \\le x \\le 3$ and $0 \\le y \\le 6$ satisfies the condition $x + y \\le 4$. This means we need to find the ratio of the area where $x + y \\le 4$ to the total area of the region defined by $0 \\le x \\le 3$ and $0 \\le y \\le 6$.\n\n## Step 2: Visualize the region\nThe region defined by $0 \\le x \\le 3$ and $0 \\le y \\le 6$ is a rectangle with a length of 3 units and a width of 6 units. The condition $x + y \\le 4$ defines an area within this rectangle. To visualize this, we can plot the line $x + y = 4$ and consider the area below or on this line as the region of interest.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area of the region of interest\nThe line $x + y = 4$ intersects the $y$-axis at $y = 4$ (when $x = 0$) and intersects the $x$-axis at $x = 4$ (when $y = 0$). However, since $x$ is constrained to $0 \\le x \\le 3$, the line intersects the right boundary of the rectangle at $x = 3$, where $y = 1$ (because $3 + y = 4$ gives $y = 1$). The region that satisfies $x + y \\le 4$ is a trapezoid with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, $(3,1)$, and $(0,4)$. The area of a trapezoid is given by $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the parallel sides, and $h$ is the height between them.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the trapezoid\nFor the trapezoid in question, $b_1 = 4$ (the length from $(0,0)$ to $(0,4)$), $b_2 = 1$ (the length from $(3,0)$ to $(3,1)$), and $h = 3$ (the distance from $x = 0$ to $x = 3$). Plugging these values into the formula gives $A = \\frac{1}{2}(4 + 1) \\times 3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 3 = \\frac{15}{2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total area of the rectangle\nThe total area of the rectangle defined by $0 \\le x \\le 3$ and $0 \\le y \\le 6$ is $A_{total} = length \\times width = 3 \\times 6 = 18$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability\nThe probability that $x + y \\le 4$ is the ratio of the area of the region where $x + y \\le 4$ to the total area of the rectangle. This is given by $P = \\frac{A}{A_{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{15}{2}}{18} = \\frac{15}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{18} = \\frac{15}{36} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{12}}$",
    "## Step 1: Define the total area of the region\nThe total area in which the point $(x, y)$ can lie is a rectangle with dimensions $3 \\times 6$, since $0 \\le x \\le 3$ and $0 \\le y \\le 6$. Thus, the total area is $3 \\times 6 = 18$ square units.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the area where $x+y \\le 4$\nTo find the area where $x+y \\le 4$, we need to visualize the line $x+y = 4$ and determine the region below or on this line within the given rectangle. The line $x+y = 4$ intersects the $x$-axis at $(4, 0)$ and the $y$-axis at $(0, 4)$. However, since $x$ only goes up to $3$, we consider the intersection of this line with the boundary of our rectangle.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the intersection points of the line $x+y = 4$ with the rectangle\nWhen $x = 3$, $3 + y = 4$, so $y = 1$. This means the line intersects the right side of the rectangle at $(3, 1)$. When $y = 0$, $x + 0 = 4$, which is outside our region of interest since $x$ cannot exceed $3$. The line also intersects the top of the rectangle, but since the condition is $x+y \\le 4$, we're interested in where it intersects the bottom and right sides.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the region where $x+y \\le 4$\nThe region where $x+y \\le 4$ forms a trapezoid within the rectangle. The top base of the trapezoid (along the $x$-axis) is $4$ units long (from $x = 0$ to $x = 4$ is not possible since $x$ only goes to $3$, but we consider the full length where $y = 0$ to $x = 3$), and the bottom base (along the line $x+y = 4$) is $1$ unit long when $x = 3$. However, to accurately describe the shape, we recognize it's more complex due to the bounds of $x$ and $y$. The correct visualization is a triangle formed by connecting $(0,4)$, $(3,1)$, and $(0,0)$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the area of the triangle\nThe area of a triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. Here, the base can be considered as $3$ (along the $x$-axis from $0$ to $3$), and the height is $4$ (from $y = 0$ to $y = 4$ at $x = 0$). However, given the actual geometry, we need to consider the effective base and height for the area calculation correctly. The effective height (difference in $y$ values) when $x = 0$ is $4$, and when $x = 3$, $y = 1$, so the effective area calculation needs to consider the triangle's actual dimensions.\n\n## Step 6: Correctly calculate the area of the region where $x+y \\le 4$\nThe correct way to think about the area is to see it as a triangle with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(3,1)$, and $(0,4)$. The base of this triangle is $3$ (from $x = 0$ to $x = 3$), and the height is $4$ (from $y = 0$ to $y = 4$ at $x = 0$), but since the line $x+y = 4$ cuts across, forming the hypotenuse of the triangle, we use the formula for the area of a triangle which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. However, recognizing the geometric error, the correct approach is to see the area as $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 4$ because the line effectively creates a triangular region within the rectangle.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability\nThe probability that $x+y \\le 4$ is the ratio of the area where $x+y \\le 4$ to the total area. This is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 4}{18}$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the probability fraction\nThe probability simplifies to $\\frac{6}{18} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$",

The line $x+y = 4$ intersects the $y$-axis at $(0,4)$ and the $x$-axis at $(4,0)$. However, since $x$ only goes up to 3, we consider the intersection with the right boundary of our rectangle at $x=3$, which gives $y = 1$ when $x+y = 4$. Thus, the area satisfying $x+y \\le 4$ forms a trapezoid within the rectangle.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area of the trapezoid\nThe trapezoid has two parallel sides (bases) formed by the segments of the lines $y=0$ and $x+y=4$ within the rectangle. The longer base (along $y=0$) is from $x=0$ to $x=3$, so its length is 3. The shorter base (along $x=3$) is from $y=0$ to $y=1$, so its length is 1 (since at $x=3$, $y$ can only go up to 1 to satisfy $x+y \\le 4$). However, to accurately describe the area, we should consider the heights of the trapezoid at its bases. At $x=0$, $y$ goes from 0 to 4 (since $0+y \\le 4$), giving a height of 4. At $x=3$, $y$ goes from 0 to 1 (since $3+y \\le 4$), giving a height of 1. The formula for the area of a trapezoid is $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases, and $h$ is the height between them. However, considering our specific case, we actually calculate the area as the sum of a rectangle and a triangle: the rectangle from $x=0$ to $x=3$ and $y=0$ to $y=1$ (area of $3 \\times 1 = 3$), and a triangle above this rectangle, bounded by $x+y=4$, with a base of 3 (from $x=0$ to $x=3$) and a height of 3 (from $y=1$ at $x=3$ to $y=4$ at $x=0$). The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 3 = \\frac{9}{2}$. Thus, the total area of the trapezoid is $3 + \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} + \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{15}{2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that $x+y \\le 4$\nThe probability is the ratio of the area where $x+y \\le 4$ to the total area. The area where $x+y \\le 4$ is $\\frac{15}{2}$ square units, and the total area is $18$ square units. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{\\frac{15}{2}}{18} = \\frac{15}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{18} = \\frac{15}{36} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{12}}$"
