    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nKarl needs to select four crayons out of 12, and the order of selection does not matter. This is a combination problem, where we need to find the number of ways to choose 4 items from a set of 12 items.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the formula for combination\nThe formula for combination is given by: $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to be chosen.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the formula to the problem\nIn this case, n = 12 (total number of crayons) and k = 4 (number of crayons to be chosen). Plugging these values into the formula, we get: $C(12, 4) = \\frac{12!}{4!(12-4)!} = \\frac{12!}{4!8!}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying the expression, we get: $C(12, 4) = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{11880}{24} = 495$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{495}$",

    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the number of ways Karl can select four crayons out of 12, where the order of selection does not matter.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the type of problem\nThis is a combination problem since the order of selection does not matter. The formula for combinations is given by C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to be selected.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the combination formula\nHere, n = 12 (total number of crayons) and k = 4 (number of crayons to be selected). Plugging these values into the combination formula, we get C(12, 4) = 12! / [4!(12-4)!].\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the factorial values\nCalculate the factorial of each number. 12! = 12 x 11 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, 4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, and (12-4)! = 8! = 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression\nWe can simplify the expression by canceling out the common factors in the numerator and denominator. C(12, 4) = (12 x 11 x 10 x 9) / (4 x 3 x 2 x 1).\n\n## Step 6: Perform the multiplication and division\nCalculate the numerator and denominator separately and then divide. Numerator = 12 x 11 x 10 x 9 = 11880, Denominator = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24.\n\n## Step 7: Final calculation\nDivide the numerator by the denominator to get the final answer. C(12, 4) = 11880 / 24 = 495.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{495}$"

  "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",
