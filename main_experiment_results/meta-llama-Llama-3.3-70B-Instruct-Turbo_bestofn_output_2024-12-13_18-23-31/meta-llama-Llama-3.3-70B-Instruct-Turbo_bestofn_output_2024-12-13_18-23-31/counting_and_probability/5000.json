  "problem": "A soccer team has $22$ available players. A fixed set of $11$ players starts the game, while the other $11$ are available as substitutes. During the game, the coach may make as many as $3$ substitutions, where any one of the $11$ players in the game is replaced by one of the substitutes. No player removed from the game may reenter the game, although a substitute entering the game may be replaced later. No two substitutions can happen at the same time. The players involved and the order of the substitutions matter. Let $n$ be the number of ways the coach can make substitutions during the game (including the possibility of making no substitutions). Find the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$.\n",

    "## Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe problem is asking for the number of ways the coach can make substitutions during a game, considering that the coach can make up to 3 substitutions, and the order of substitutions matters.\n\n## Step 2: Calculating the Number of Ways for No Substitutions\nIf the coach makes no substitutions, there is only 1 way to do this.\n\n## Step 3: Calculating the Number of Ways for 1 Substitution\nFor 1 substitution, the coach can choose any of the 11 starting players to substitute out and any of the 11 substitutes to substitute in. This gives $11 \\times 11 = 121$ ways.\n\n## Step 4: Calculating the Number of Ways for 2 Substitutions\nFor 2 substitutions, the coach has 11 choices for the first player to substitute out, 10 choices for the second player to substitute out, 11 choices for the first substitute to bring in, and 10 choices for the second substitute to bring in. This gives $11 \\times 10 \\times 11 \\times 10 = 12100$ ways.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the Number of Ways for 3 Substitutions\nFor 3 substitutions, the coach has 11 choices for the first player to substitute out, 10 choices for the second player to substitute out, 9 choices for the third player to substitute out, 11 choices for the first substitute to bring in, 10 choices for the second substitute to bring in, and 9 choices for the third substitute to bring in. This gives $11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 = 108900$ ways.\n\n## Step 6: Summing Up All Possible Ways and Finding the Remainder\nTo find the total number of ways, we sum the results from steps 2 through 5: $1 + 121 + 12100 + 108900 = 120122$. Then, we find the remainder when this total is divided by 1000.\n\n## Step 7: Calculating the Remainder\nThe remainder when 120122 is divided by 1000 is 122.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{122}$",

  "solution": "There are $0-3$ substitutions. The number of ways to sub any number of times must be multiplied by the previous number. This is defined recursively. The case for $0$ subs is $1$, and the ways to reorganize after $n$ subs is the product of the number of new subs ($12-n$) and the players that can be ejected ($11$). The formula for $n$ subs is then $a_n=11(12-n)a_{n-1}$ with $a_0=1$.\nSumming from $0$ to $3$ gives $1+11^2+11^{3}\\cdot 10+11^{4}\\cdot 10\\cdot 9$. Notice that $10+9\\cdot11\\cdot10=10+990=1000$. Then, rearrange it into $1+11^2+11^3\\cdot (10+11\\cdot10\\cdot9)= 1+11^2+11^3\\cdot (1000)$. When taking modulo $1000$, the last term goes away. What is left is $1+11^2=\\boxed{122}$.",
