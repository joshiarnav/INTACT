    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are tasked with finding the largest 2-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$. To approach this problem, we first need to understand what ${200\\choose 100}$ represents. This expression is a binomial coefficient, which calculates the number of ways to choose 100 items from a set of 200 items without regard to order.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the binomial coefficient\nThe formula for a binomial coefficient is ${n\\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Applying this to our problem, we get ${200\\choose 100} = \\frac{200!}{100!100!}$. This calculation involves factorials, which are the products of all positive integers up to a given number.\n\n## Step 3: Factor out the factorials\nTo simplify the calculation, we can factor out the factorials. Notice that $200! = 200 \\times 199 \\times 198 \\times ... \\times 101 \\times 100!$. Thus, we can rewrite the expression as $\\frac{200 \\times 199 \\times 198 \\times ... \\times 101}{100!}$, since the $100!$ in the numerator and denominator cancel out.\n\n## Step 4: Look for prime factors\nNow, we need to look for prime factors of the expression, particularly focusing on 2-digit primes. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. We can factor out the primes from the numerator.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the largest 2-digit prime factor\nFrom the factored form, we need to identify the largest 2-digit prime factor. This involves checking the primes in the range of 10 to 99, as these are the 2-digit primes.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the factorization of the expression\nAnalyzing the factorization, we notice that all the numbers from 200 down to 101 are included. Among these, the largest 2-digit prime is 97, but we must verify if it is indeed a factor of ${200\\choose 100}$.\n\n## Step 7: Verify the presence of 97\nSince 97 is a prime number and it falls within the range of numbers being multiplied (from 200 down to 101), it is indeed a factor of the expression ${200\\choose 100}$.\n\n## Step 8: Conclude the largest 2-digit prime factor\nGiven that 97 is the largest 2-digit prime and it is a factor of ${200\\choose 100}$, we conclude that the largest 2-digit prime factor of $n = {200\\choose 100}$ is 97.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{97}$",

This is a binomial coefficient, calculated as $\\frac{200!}{100!100!}$, which represents the number of ways to choose 100 items out of 200 without regard to order.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the binomial coefficient\nThe binomial coefficient ${200\\choose 100}$ can be calculated using the formula $\\frac{200!}{100!100!}$. However, calculating this directly is impractical due to the large factorials involved. Instead, we look for patterns or properties that can help simplify the problem.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the binomial coefficient\nWe can simplify the calculation by looking at the prime factorization of the factorials. The idea is to find the power of each prime in the numerator and denominator and then simplify. However, given the large numbers, direct calculation is still not feasible without computational tools.\n\n## Step 4: Identify prime factors\nSince we're looking for the largest 2-digit prime factor, we need to consider prime numbers less than 100. Notably, large prime numbers close to 100, such as 97, 89, 83, etc., could be potential candidates if they divide $n$. However, directly testing these without calculation is challenging.\n\n## Step 5: Use properties of binomial coefficients\nRecall that ${n\\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ is divisible by all prime numbers $p$ such that $p \\leq n$ and $p$ does not divide $k!$ or $(n-k)!$. Given $n=200$ and $k=100$, any prime $p > 100$ cannot be a factor of ${200\\choose 100}$ because it would not divide $100!$ or $100!$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the largest 2-digit prime factor\nSince directly computing ${200\\choose 100}$ is not straightforward without a calculator, we consider significant prime factors. Noting that $n$ will have factors of all primes up to 100 (due to the nature of factorials), the largest 2-digit prime (which is less than 100) could potentially be a factor. The largest 2-digit prime is 97.\n\n## Step 7: Confirm the factor\nTo confirm if 97 is indeed a factor, we consider its properties. Since 97 is a prime number and is less than 200, and it does not divide 100! (because 97 is prime and larger than any factor in 100!), it should be a factor of ${200\\choose 100}$ unless it's countered by being a factor of the denominator in the binomial coefficient formula, which it's not due to its prime nature and being larger than factors in 100!.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{97}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand what the problem is asking for\nWe need to find the largest 2-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$. This means we first need to understand what ${200\\choose 100}$ represents and how to calculate it.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate ${200\\choose 100}$\nThe expression ${200\\choose 100}$ represents the number of ways to choose 100 items out of 200 without regard to order. It is calculated using the formula ${n\\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n!$ denotes the factorial of $n$, which is the product of all positive integers up to $n$. So, ${200\\choose 100} = \\frac{200!}{100!(200-100)!} = \\frac{200!}{100!100!}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the factorial expression\nTo simplify, notice that $\\frac{200!}{100!100!}$ can be written as $\\frac{200 \\times 199 \\times 198 \\times ... \\times 101}{100 \\times 99 \\times 98 \\times ... \\times 1}$, because the $100!$ in the denominator cancels out the last 100 numbers of $200!$ in the numerator.\n\n## Step 4: Identify prime factors in the simplified expression\nWe are looking for the largest 2-digit prime factor. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The largest 2-digit prime number is 97. Since our expression includes all numbers from 200 down to 101 in the numerator, we should check if any of these numbers have prime factors that are 2-digit primes, especially focusing on the larger 2-digit primes like 97, 89, 83, etc.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the relevance of prime numbers to the factorial expression\nGiven that ${200\\choose 100}$ includes products of consecutive numbers, we should recognize that any prime number less than or equal to 200 will be a factor of at least one of the numbers in the product series of $200!$. Therefore, to find the largest 2-digit prime factor, we consider prime numbers less than 100, as any prime greater than 100 would not be a factor of ${200\\choose 100}$ due to the nature of factorials and combinations.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the largest 2-digit prime factor\nAmong the prime numbers less than 100, the largest ones are 97, 89, 83, 79, 73, 71, 67, 61, 59, 53, 47, 43, 41, 37, 31, 29, 23, 19, 17, 13, 11, 7, 5, 3, and 2. Since ${200\\choose 100}$ is the product of all numbers from 101 to 200, divided by the product of all numbers from 1 to 100, any prime number less than 100 will be a factor of the expression. The question then is which of these primes is the largest and also a factor of ${200\\choose 100}$.\n\n## Step 7: Realize that all primes less than 100 are factors of ${200\\choose 100}$\nSince ${200\\choose 100}$ includes all numbers from 101 to 200 in its numerator, and given that every number in this range is divisible by at least one prime number less than 100 (due to the nature of factorials and prime numbers), we can deduce that all prime numbers less than 100 are indeed factors of ${200\\choose 100}$. Therefore, the largest 2-digit prime factor of ${200\\choose 100}$ would be the largest prime number less than 100.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{97}$"

  "solution": "Expanding the binomial coefficient, we get ${200 \\choose 100}=\\frac{200!}{100!100!}$. Let the required prime be $p$; then $10 \\le p < 100$. If $p > 50$, then the factor of $p$ appears twice in the denominator. Thus, we need $p$ to appear as a factor at least three times in the numerator, so $3p<200$.
