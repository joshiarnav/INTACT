    "## Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe problem describes a bug starting from vertex $A$ of a regular tetrahedron and crawling along the edges according to certain rules. The tetrahedron has vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, and each edge is 1 meter long. The bug chooses one of the three edges at each vertex with equal probability and crawls along that edge to the opposite vertex.\n\n## Step 2: Defining the Recursive Relationship\nLet's define $P(n)$ as the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ after crawling $n$ meters. Since the bug can only be at vertex $A$ if it just left a vertex that is not $A$, we have a recursive relationship. The probability of being at $A$ after crawling $n$ meters depends on not being at $A$ after crawling $n-1$ meters.\n\n## Step 3: Establishing the Base Case\nThe base case is $P(0) = 1$, because initially, when the bug has crawled 0 meters, it is definitely at vertex $A$.\n\n## Step 4: Deriving the Recursive Formula\nFor $n \\geq 1$, the bug can be at vertex $A$ if and only if it was not at $A$ in the previous step. Given that it was not at $A$, it has a $\\frac{1}{3}$ chance of reaching $A$ in the next step. Therefore, the recursive formula is $P(n) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(n-1))$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating $P(1)$ to $P(7)$\nUsing the recursive formula, we calculate step by step:\n- $P(1) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(0)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - 1) = 0$\n- $P(2) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(1)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - 0) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n- $P(3) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(2)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - \\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{9}$\n- $P(4) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(3)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - \\frac{2}{9}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{7}{9} = \\frac{7}{27}$\n- $P(5) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(4)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - \\frac{7}{27}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{20}{27} = \\frac{20}{81}$\n- $P(6) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(5)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - \\frac{20}{81}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{61}{81} = \\frac{61}{243}$\n- $P(7) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(6)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - \\frac{61}{243}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{182}{243} = \\frac{182}{729}$\n\n## Step 6: Finding $n$\nGiven $P(7) = \\frac{182}{729}$, we have $p = \\frac{n}{729} = \\frac{182}{729}$. Therefore, $n = 182$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{182}$",
    "## Step 1: Define the problem and understand the scenario\nWe have a regular tetrahedron with vertices A, B, C, and D. Each edge of the tetrahedron is 1 meter long. A bug starts at vertex A and moves to an adjacent vertex by crawling along one of the three edges connected to its current vertex. The bug chooses each edge with equal probability.\n\n## Step 2: Establish the recursive relationship for the probability\nLet's denote $P(n)$ as the probability that the bug is at vertex A after crawling n meters. For the bug to be at vertex A after crawling n meters, it must have just left a vertex that is not A. Thus, it must not be at A after crawling (n-1) meters. Given that it's not at A after (n-1) meters, the probability that it reaches A in the next step is 1/3, because there's only one edge from any non-A vertex that leads to A out of the three edges available.\n\n## Step 3: Derive the recursive formula\nThe probability $P(n)$ that the bug is at vertex A after crawling n meters can be expressed in terms of the probability $P(n-1)$ that it is not at A after crawling (n-1) meters. Since the bug can only be at A if it just came from a different vertex, we have: $P(n) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(n-1))$.\n\n## Step 4: Set the initial condition\nThe initial condition is $P(0) = 1$, because the bug starts at vertex A with certainty.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the recursive formula to find P(1), P(2), ..., P(7)\nUsing the recursive formula $P(n) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(n-1))$, we can calculate the probabilities step by step:\n- $P(1) = 0$ because the bug cannot be at A after just 1 step.\n- $P(2) = \\frac{1}{3}$, because after the first step it's not at A, and then it has a 1/3 chance of returning to A.\n- $P(3) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(2)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - \\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{9}$.\n- $P(4) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(3)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - \\frac{2}{9}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{7}{9} = \\frac{7}{27}$.\n- $P(5) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(4)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - \\frac{7}{27}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{20}{27} = \\frac{20}{81}$.\n- $P(6) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(5)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - \\frac{20}{81}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{61}{81} = \\frac{61}{243}$.\n- $P(7) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(6)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - \\frac{61}{243}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{182}{243} = \\frac{182}{729}$.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the value of n for P(7)\nGiven $P(7) = \\frac{182}{729}$, the value of $n$ in $p = \\frac{n}{729}$ is 182.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{182}$",
    "## Step 1: Define the problem and its constraints\nWe have a regular tetrahedron with vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, and a bug starting from vertex $A$. The bug moves along the edges of the tetrahedron, choosing each edge with equal probability, and we want to find the probability that the bug is back at vertex $A$ after crawling exactly 7 meters.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the recursive pattern of the bug's movement\nLet's denote $P(n)$ as the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ after crawling $n$ meters. We notice that if the bug is at vertex $A$ after crawling $n$ meters, it must have just left a vertex that is not $A$. Thus, it has a $\\frac{1}{3}$ chance of reaching vertex $A$ in the next step. Therefore, we can establish a recursive relationship to calculate $P(n)$.\n\n## Step 3: Establish the recursive relationship\nWe have the relationship $P(n + 1) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(n))$. This is because the bug can only be at vertex $A$ at step $n+1$ if it was not at $A$ at step $n$, and it chooses the edge leading to $A$ at step $n+1$, which happens with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the initial condition\nThe initial condition is $P(0) = 1$ because the bug starts at vertex $A$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $P(1)$, $P(2)$, $P(3)$, $P(4)$, $P(5)$, $P(6)$, and $P(7)$ using the recursive relationship\n$P(1) = 0$ because the bug cannot be at $A$ after just 1 step.\n$P(2) = \\frac{1}{3}$ because it has a $\\frac{1}{3}$ chance of returning to $A$ after 2 steps.\n$P(3) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(2)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{9}$.\n$P(4) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(3)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - \\frac{2}{9}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{7}{9} = \\frac{7}{27}$.\n$P(5) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(4)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - \\frac{7}{27}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{20}{27} = \\frac{20}{81}$.\n$P(6) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(5)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - \\frac{20}{81}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{61}{81} = \\frac{61}{243}$.\n$P(7) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(6)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - \\frac{61}{243}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{182}{243} = \\frac{182}{729}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $n$ from $P(7)$\nGiven $P(7) = \\frac{n}{729}$, we find that $n = 182$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{182}$"
