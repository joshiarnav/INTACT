    "## Step 1: Define the variables for the problem\nLet's denote the total number of students studying Spanish as $S$, the total number of students studying French as $F$, and the number of students studying both as $B$. We know that $S + F - B = 2001$ because each student studies either Spanish or French, and some study both.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the minimum and maximum number of students studying Spanish\nGiven that the number who study Spanish is between $80\\%$ and $85\\%$ of the school population, we can find the minimum and maximum numbers of students studying Spanish. The minimum number of students studying Spanish is $80\\%$ of $2001$, which is $0.80 \\times 2001 = 1600.8$. Since the number of students must be an integer, the minimum number of students studying Spanish is $1601$. The maximum number of students studying Spanish is $85\\%$ of $2001$, which is $0.85 \\times 2001 = 1700.85$. Therefore, the maximum number of students studying Spanish is $1700$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the minimum and maximum number of students studying French\nSimilarly, given that the number who study French is between $30\\%$ and $40\\%$ of the school population, we can find the minimum and maximum numbers of students studying French. The minimum number of students studying French is $30\\%$ of $2001$, which is $0.30 \\times 2001 = 600.3$. Thus, the minimum number of students studying French is $601$. The maximum number of students studying French is $40\\%$ of $2001$, which is $0.40 \\times 2001 = 800.4$. Therefore, the maximum number of students studying French is $800$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the smallest number of students who could study both languages, m\nTo find the smallest number of students who could study both languages ($m$), we need to minimize $B = S + F - 2001$. This occurs when $S$ and $F$ are minimized. So, $m = 1601 + 601 - 2001 = 201$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the largest number of students who could study both languages, M\nTo find the largest number of students who could study both languages ($M$), we need to maximize $B = S + F - 2001$. This occurs when $S$ and $F$ are maximized. So, $M = 1700 + 800 - 2001 = 499$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate M - m\nNow, we can calculate $M - m$ to find the difference between the largest and smallest number of students who could study both languages. $M - m = 499 - 201 = 298$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{298}$",
    "## Step 1: Calculate the minimum and maximum number of students studying Spanish.\nTo find the minimum and maximum number of students studying Spanish, we need to calculate 80% and 85% of the total number of students. The minimum number of students studying Spanish is $\\lceil 80\\% \\cdot 2001 \\rceil = \\lceil 0.8 \\cdot 2001 \\rceil = \\lceil 1600.8 \\rceil = 1601$. The maximum number of students studying Spanish is $\\lfloor 85\\% \\cdot 2001 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 0.85 \\cdot 2001 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1700.85 \\rfloor = 1700$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the minimum and maximum number of students studying French.\nTo find the minimum and maximum number of students studying French, we need to calculate 30% and 40% of the total number of students. The minimum number of students studying French is $\\lceil 30\\% \\cdot 2001 \\rceil = \\lceil 0.3 \\cdot 2001 \\rceil = \\lceil 600.3 \\rceil = 601$. The maximum number of students studying French is $\\lfloor 40\\% \\cdot 2001 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 0.4 \\cdot 2001 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 800.4 \\rfloor = 800$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the smallest number of students who could study both languages (m).\nThe smallest number of students who could study both languages occurs when the number of students studying Spanish is minimized and the number of students studying French is minimized. Let's denote the number of students studying Spanish as $S$, the number of students studying French as $F$, and the number of students studying both as $B$. We have $S + F - B = 2001$. The smallest $B$ can be is when $S$ and $F$ are at their minimum, so $m = 1601 + 601 - 2001 = 201$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the largest number of students who could study both languages (M).\nThe largest number of students who could study both languages occurs when the number of students studying Spanish is maximized and the number of students studying French is maximized. Using the same equation $S + F - B = 2001$, the largest $B$ can be is when $S$ and $F$ are at their maximum, so $M = 1700 + 800 - 2001 = 499$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the difference between the largest and smallest number of students studying both languages.\nTo find the difference, subtract the smallest number from the largest: $M - m = 499 - 201 = 298$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{298}$",
    "## Step 1: Define the variables for the problem\nLet's denote S as the number of students studying Spanish, F as the number of students studying French, and x as the number of students studying both languages.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the range of students studying Spanish\nGiven that the number of students studying Spanish is between 80% and 85% of the total students (2001), the range for S can be calculated as: $0.8 \\times 2001 \\leq S \\leq 0.85 \\times 2001$. Thus, $1600.8 \\leq S \\leq 1700.85$. Since the number of students must be an integer, we can round this range to $1601 \\leq S \\leq 1700$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the range of students studying French\nSimilarly, the number of students studying French is between 30% and 40% of the total students (2001), so the range for F can be calculated as: $0.3 \\times 2001 \\leq F \\leq 0.4 \\times 2001$. Thus, $600.3 \\leq F \\leq 800.4$. Rounding to integers, we get $601 \\leq F \\leq 800$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the smallest number of students who could study both languages (m)\nThe smallest number of students studying both languages occurs when S is minimized and F is minimized. Therefore, we use the smallest values from the ranges calculated: $S = 1601$ and $F = 601$. The total number of students studying either Spanish or French or both is $S + F - x = 2001$, where x is the number of students studying both. Rearranging for x gives $x = S + F - 2001$. Substituting S and F gives $m = 1601 + 601 - 2001 = 201$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the largest number of students who could study both languages (M)\nThe largest number of students studying both languages occurs when S is maximized and F is maximized. Thus, we use the largest values from the ranges: $S = 1700$ and $F = 800$. Using the same equation $x = S + F - 2001$ and substituting S and F gives $M = 1700 + 800 - 2001 = 499$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the difference between M and m\nTo find $M - m$, we simply subtract the smallest number of students studying both languages from the largest number: $M - m = 499 - 201$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{298}$"
