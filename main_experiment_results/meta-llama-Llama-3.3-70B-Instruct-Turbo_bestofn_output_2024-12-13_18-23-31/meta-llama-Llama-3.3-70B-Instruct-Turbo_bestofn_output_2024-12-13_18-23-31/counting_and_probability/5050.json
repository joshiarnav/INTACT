    "## Step 1: Define the problem and the approach to solve it\nWe are given a set $\\mathcal{S}$ that contains the elements $\\lbrace1,2,3,\\ldots,10\\rbrace$. We need to find the number of sets of two non-empty disjoint subsets of $\\mathcal{S}$, denoted as $n$, and then find the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$. To approach this, let's consider how we can form these disjoint subsets.\n\n## Step 2: Counting the number of ways to select elements for the first subset\nFor each element $i \\in \\mathcal{S}$, there are $3$ choices: it could be in $A$, in $B$, or in neither $A$ nor $B$. This gives us $3^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $\\mathcal{S}$ into disjoint $A$ and $B$. However, this count includes cases where either $A$ or $B$ (or both) are empty, which do not meet the criteria of non-empty disjoint subsets.\n\n## Step 3: Adjust the count to exclude empty subsets\nWe need to subtract the cases where $A$ is empty, $B$ is empty, or both $A$ and $B$ are empty. If $A$ is empty, then all $10$ elements of $\\mathcal{S}$ must be in $B$ or in neither $A$ nor $B$, giving $2^{10}$ possibilities. Similarly, there are $2^{10}$ possibilities if $B$ is empty. However, we've double-counted the case where both $A$ and $B$ are empty, which can happen in only $1$ way.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we subtract the cases where $A$ or $B$ is empty from the total count of $3^{10}$, but then add back the case where both are empty since it's been subtracted twice. This gives us $3^{10} - 2 \\cdot 2^{10} + 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the value\nWe now calculate $3^{10} - 2 \\cdot 2^{10} + 1$ to find $n$. $3^{10} = 59049$, $2^{10} = 1024$, so $n = 59049 - 2 \\cdot 1024 + 1 = 59049 - 2048 + 1 = 57002$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$\nFinally, we need to find the remainder when $n = 57002$ is divided by $1000$ to get our answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{502}$",

Disjoint subsets are sets that have no common elements. This means for any two subsets $A$ and $B$ that are disjoint, $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the total number of possible subsets of $\\mathcal{S}$\nFor a set with $n$ elements, the total number of subsets (including the empty set) is $2^n$. Since $\\mathcal{S}$ has 10 elements, there are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible subsets of $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the counting method for disjoint subsets\nTo count the number of sets of two non-empty disjoint subsets, we can consider the following approach: for each element $i$ in $\\mathcal{S}$, it can either be in subset $A$, in subset $B$, or in neither. This gives us $3^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $\\mathcal{S}$ into disjoint $A$ and $B$. However, this count includes cases where either $A$ or $B$ (or both) are empty.\n\n## Step 4: Adjust the count for non-empty disjoint subsets\nFrom the $3^{10}$ total ways to organize elements into $A$ and $B$, we need to subtract the cases where $A$ is empty (and all elements are either in $B$ or neither), where $B$ is empty (and all elements are either in $A$ or neither), but add back the case where both $A$ and $B$ are empty since it's subtracted twice. There are $2^{10}$ ways for $A$ to be empty (each element can be in $B$ or neither), and similarly $2^{10}$ ways for $B$ to be empty. There's exactly 1 way for both $A$ and $B$ to be empty (all elements are in neither). So, the adjustment is $3^{10} - 2 \\times 2^{10} + 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the adjusted count\nNow, let's calculate the adjusted count: $3^{10} - 2 \\times 2^{10} + 1$. This is $59049 - 2 \\times 1024 + 1 = 59049 - 2048 + 1 = 57002$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the remainder when divided by 1000\nTo find the remainder when $n = 57002$ is divided by 1000, we take $n \\mod 1000$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

Similarly, there are $2^{10}$ ways for $B$ to be empty and $A$ to be any subset of $\\mathcal{S}$. However, we've counted the case where both $A$ and $B$ are empty twice, so we need to subtract $1$ to avoid double-counting.\n\n## Step 4: Account for the cases where either $A$ or $B$ is empty.\nThe total number of cases where either $A$ or $B$ is empty (but not both) is $2 \\times 2^{10} - 1$. We subtract this from the total number of ways to organize the elements into $A$ and $B$ to get the number of ordered pairs of sets $(A,B)$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of unordered sets $\\{ A,B \\}$.\nSince the question asks for the number of unordered sets $\\{ A,B \\}$, we must divide the number of ordered pairs $(A,B)$ by $2$ to avoid counting each pair twice.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final number of sets of two non-empty disjoint subsets.\nThe total number of ways to organize the elements into non-empty disjoint $A$ and $B$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(3^{10}-2 \\times 2^{10} + 1)$.\n\n## Step 7: Compute the value.\nLet's calculate this: $\\frac{1}{2}(3^{10}-2 \\times 2^{10} + 1) = \\frac{1}{2}(59049 - 2 \\times 1024 + 1) = \\frac{1}{2}(59049 - 2048 + 1) = \\frac{1}{2}(57002) = 28501$.\n\n## Step 8: Find the remainder when divided by $1000$.\nTo find the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$, we compute $n \\mod 1000$. Here, $28501 \\mod 1000 = 501$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{501}$"
