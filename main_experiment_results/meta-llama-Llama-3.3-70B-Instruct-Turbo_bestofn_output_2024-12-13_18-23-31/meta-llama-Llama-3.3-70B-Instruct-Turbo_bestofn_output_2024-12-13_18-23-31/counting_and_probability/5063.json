  "problem": "The cards in a stack of $2n$ cards are numbered consecutively from 1 through $2n$ from top to bottom. The top $n$ cards are removed, kept in order, and form pile $A.$ The remaining cards form pile $B.$ The cards are then restacked by taking cards alternately from the tops of pile $B$ and $A,$ respectively. In this process, card number $(n+1)$ becomes the bottom card of the new stack, card number 1 is on top of this card, and so on, until piles $A$ and $B$ are exhausted. If, after the restacking process, at least one card from each pile occupies the same position that it occupied in the original stack, the stack is named magical. For example, eight cards form a magical stack because cards number 3 and number 6 retain their original positions. Find the number of cards in the magical stack in which card number 131 retains its original position.\n",

    "## Step 1: Understanding the problem and the process of restacking\nThe problem describes a process where a stack of $2n$ cards is divided into two piles, A and B, after removing the top $n$ cards. The cards are then restacked alternately from piles B and A. We are tasked with finding the number of cards in the magical stack where card number 131 retains its original position after restacking.\n\n## Step 2: Identifying the pattern of card placement after restacking\nSince the cards are alternately restacked from piles B and A, the cards from pile B will be marked as even numbers in the new pile, while the cards from pile A will be marked as odd numbers in the new pile. This pattern helps in understanding how cards are placed after restacking.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing the position of card 131 in the original stack\nCard 131 is an odd number, which means it must come from pile A. For card 131 to retain its original position, it must be placed back in the stack after alternating cards from piles B and A, such that it ends up in the 131st position.\n\n## Step 4: Calculating the number of cards from pile B that come before card 131\nSince card 131 is odd and comes from pile A, there must be exactly 130 cards before it in the new stack, with 65 cards from pile B and 65 cards from pile A. This is because the cards are alternately placed from piles B and A.\n\n## Step 5: Determining the total number of cards in pile A and pile B\nGiven that card 131 comes from pile A and is the 66th card in pile A (since it's the 131st card overall and there are 65 cards from pile A before it), and there are 65 cards from pile B before it, we can deduce that $n = 196$ because card 131 is in pile A, and it is the 66th card in pile A.\n\n## Step 6: Calculating the total number of cards in the original stack\nThe total number of cards in the original stack is $2n$, where $n$ is the number of cards in pile A. Since $n = 196$, the total number of cards is $2 \\times 196 = 392$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{392}$",

The cards are then restacked alternately from piles B and A. We need to find the number of cards in the magical stack where card number 131 retains its original position after restacking.\n\n## Step 2:  Analyze the conditions for a card to retain its original position.\nFor a card to retain its original position, it must be placed back in the stack after alternating cards are drawn from piles B and A. Since card 131 is odd, it must be in pile A. Moreover, to retain its original position, exactly $131 - 1 = 130$ numbers must be in front of it, and since each pair of alternate cards contains one card from pile B and one from pile A, there must be $\\frac{130}{2} = 65$ cards from pile B and 65 cards from pile A in front of card 131.\n\n## Step 3:  Determine the total number of cards in the stack.\nGiven that card 131 is the $66^{th}$ card in pile A, and there are $n$ cards in pile A, it follows that $n \\geq 66 \\cdot 2 = 132$. Additionally, since card 131 is the $196^{th}$ card in the combined pile, there must be $196 - 65 = 131$ cards from pile B. Therefore, the total number of cards in the stack is $2n$, and we need to find the smallest $n$ that satisfies these conditions.\n\n## Step 4:  Calculate the smallest $n$ that satisfies the conditions.\nSince $n$ must be at least 132, and the total number of cards in the stack must be $2n$, the smallest $n$ that satisfies the conditions will give us the number of cards in the magical stack where card 131 retains its original position.\n\n## Step 5:  Apply the condition that $n$ must be greater than or equal to 196 to ensure card 131 is in its original position.\nWe know that card 131 is in pile A and is the $131^{st}$ card overall. To retain its position, there should be 65 cards from each of piles A and B before it. Since the $131^{st}$ card is in position 131, we have $n \\geq 196$ to ensure there are enough cards in pile A for the conditions to be satisfied.\n\n## Step 6:  Calculate the total number of cards in the magical stack.\nGiven that $n \\geq 196$, the smallest value for $n$ to satisfy all conditions is 196. Thus, the total number of cards in the magical stack where card 131 retains its original position is $2 \\times 196$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{392}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the process of restacking the cards\nThe problem describes a process where a stack of $2n$ cards, numbered from 1 to $2n$, is divided into two piles: pile $A$ consisting of the top $n$ cards and pile $B$ consisting of the remaining $n$ cards. The cards are then restacked alternately from piles $B$ and $A$. We need to find the number of cards in the magical stack where card number 131 retains its original position after restacking.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the conditions for a card to retain its original position\nFor a card to retain its original position, it must be placed back in the stack after alternating draws from piles $B$ and $A$ in such a way that it ends up in the same position as it was originally. This means that the card must be drawn from the pile at a specific point in the alternating draw process that corresponds to its original position.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the position of card 131 in the original stack\nCard 131 is in the position that is $131 - 1 = 130$ cards from the top of the stack, since the top card is card 1. Given that cards are alternately drawn from piles $B$ and $A$, and considering that $131$ is an odd number, it must come from pile $A$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of cards drawn before card 131\nSince cards are alternately drawn from piles $B$ and $A$, and card 131 is from pile $A$, there must be an equal number of cards drawn from both piles before card 131 is drawn. This means that $\\frac{130}{2} = 65$ cards must have been drawn from each pile before drawing card 131.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the total number of cards in the stack\nSince card 131 is in pile $A$, and $65$ cards from pile $A$ have been drawn before it, this implies that $n$, the number of cards in pile $A$, must be greater than 65. Moreover, since card 131 ends up in its original position, the number of cards in the stack can be derived from the fact that the $131^{st}$ card is in the position that allows it to be drawn after $65$ pairs of cards have been alternately drawn from piles $B$ and $A$. This suggests that $n$ should be such that it accommodates this arrangement.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of cards in the stack based on the given conditions\nGiven that $131$ retains its original position, and knowing that $65$ cards from each pile are drawn before it, the total number of cards in the stack can be calculated. The total number of cards drawn before card 131 is $65 \\times 2 = 130$, and since card 131 is also part of the stack, the total number of cards must be $2n = 130 + 1 + (n - 65 - 1)$, because card 131 is the $66^{th}$ card in pile $A$. This simplifies to $2n = 196$, because we have $130$ cards before card 131, plus card 131 itself, plus the remaining cards in pile $A$ after card 131.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{392}$"

  "solution": "Since a card from B is placed on the bottom of the new stack, notice that cards from pile B will be marked as an even number in the new pile, while cards from pile A will be marked as odd in the new pile.
