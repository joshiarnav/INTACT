    "## Step 1: Understanding the problem and setting the context\nThe problem describes a soccer tournament with seven teams where each team plays every other team once. The outcomes of the games are independent, with each team having a 50% chance of winning each game. The winner of a game is awarded 1 point, and the loser gets 0 points. The first game results in team A beating team B. We are asked to find the probability that team A finishes with more points than team B.\n\n## Step 2: Identifying the possible outcomes for the remaining games\nAfter the first game, there are 5 remaining games for team A and 5 remaining games for team B, as each team plays every other team once. This means that the results of these games will determine the final ranking of the teams.\n\n## Step 3: Realizing the symmetry and simplification\nThe results of the 5 remaining games for team A and team B are independent of the first game. Therefore, we can assume that team A and team B have an equal probability of winning their remaining games. This simplifies the problem, as we only need to consider the probability of team A scoring higher than team B in these remaining games.\n\n## Step 4: Calculating the probability using combinations\nTo calculate the probability that team A finishes with more points than team B, we need to consider all possible outcomes of the remaining 10 games (5 games for team A and 5 games for team B) and find the probability that team A has more points than team B.\n\n## Step 5: Considering the cases where team A has more points\nWe can break this down into cases where team A has more wins than team B in the remaining games. Since there are a total of 10 remaining games, we can use combinations to calculate the probability of team A having more wins than team B.\n\n## Step 6: Finding the probability for each case\nFor each case, we calculate the probability of team A having k wins (where k ranges from 0 to 5) and team B having less than k wins. We can use the binomial coefficient to calculate the number of combinations for each case.\n\n## Step 7: Summing up the probabilities for all cases\nWe sum up the probabilities for all cases where team A has more wins than team B. This will give us the total probability that team A finishes with more points than team B.\n\n## Step 8: Calculating the probability\nAfter considering all possible cases and calculating the probabilities, we find that the probability is $\\frac{319}{512}$.\n\n## Step 9: Finding the sum of m and n\nThe problem requires us to find the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the probability, i.e., m + n.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{831}$"
