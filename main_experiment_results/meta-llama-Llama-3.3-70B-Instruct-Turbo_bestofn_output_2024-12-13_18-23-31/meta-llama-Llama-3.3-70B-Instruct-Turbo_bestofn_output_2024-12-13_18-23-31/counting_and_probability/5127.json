    "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of plates\nThe total number of plates is 5 blue + 2 red + 2 green + 1 orange = 10 plates.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of arrangements for the plates in a linear fashion\nTo arrange the plates in a linear fashion, we use the formula for permutations of items with repetition:\nTotal linear arrangements = 10! / (5! * 2! * 2! * 1!) = 7560.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of arrangements for the plates in a circular fashion\nFor circular arrangements, we divide the total linear arrangements by the number of plates to account for the rotation symmetry:\nTotal circular arrangements = 7560 / 10 = 756.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of arrangements where the 2 green plates are adjacent\nTo do this, we treat the 2 green plates as a single unit, resulting in 9 units to arrange (5 blue + 2 red + 1 orange + 1 green unit).\nTotal linear arrangements with green plates adjacent = 9! / (5! * 2! * 1! * 1!) = 1512.\nTotal circular arrangements with green plates adjacent = 1512 / 9 = 168.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of arrangements where the 2 green plates are not adjacent\nTo find the number of arrangements where the 2 green plates are not adjacent, we subtract the number of arrangements where they are adjacent from the total number of circular arrangements:\nArrangements with green plates not adjacent = Total circular arrangements - Total circular arrangements with green plates adjacent = 756 - 168.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{588}$",

  "solution": "We apply the complement principle: we find the total number of cases in which the 2 green places are adjacent, and subtract from the total number of cases.\nThere are $\\frac{10!}{5!2!2!1!} = 7560$ ways to arrange the plates in a linear fashion. However, since the plates are arranged in a circle, there are $10$ ways to rotate the plates, and so there are $7560/10 = 756$ ways to arrange the plates in a circular fashion (consider, for example, fixing the orange plate at the top of the table).\nIf the two green plates are adjacent, we may think of them as a single entity, so that there are now $9$ objects to be placed around the table in a circular fashion. Using the same argument, there are $\\frac{9!}{5!2!1!1!} = 1512$ ways to arrange the objects in a linear fashion, and $1512/9 = 168$ ways in a circular fashion.\nThus, the answer is $756 - 168 = \\boxed{588}$.",
