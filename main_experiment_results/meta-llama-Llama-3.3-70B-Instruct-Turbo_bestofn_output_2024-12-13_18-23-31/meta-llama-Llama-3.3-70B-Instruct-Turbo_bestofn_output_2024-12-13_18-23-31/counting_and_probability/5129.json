    "## Step 1: Define the problem\nWe need to find the number of ways a paperboy can deliver papers to 10 houses without missing three consecutive houses.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the approach\nThis problem can be solved using recursion or dynamic programming, as it involves finding a pattern in the number of ways to deliver papers based on previous actions.\n\n## Step 3: Establish the base cases\nLet's denote $a_n$ as the number of ways to deliver papers to $n$ houses without missing three consecutive houses. The base cases are:\n- $a_1 = 2$ (deliver or not deliver to the first house)\n- $a_2 = 4$ (for each of the two houses, deliver or not deliver)\n- $a_3 = 7$ (considering all combinations where not all three houses are missed)\n\n## Step 4: Find the recursive relationship\nFor $n \\geq 4$, the number of ways $a_n$ can be calculated by considering the following:\n- If the paperboy delivers to the $n$th house, he can do so in $a_{n-1}$ ways (since the $n$th house being delivered to does not depend on the previous houses).\n- If the paperboy does not deliver to the $n$th house but delivers to the $(n-1)$th house, he can do so in $a_{n-2}$ ways (since the $(n-1)$th house being delivered ensures that not three consecutive houses are missed).\n- If the paperboy does not deliver to the $n$th and $(n-1)$th houses, he must deliver to the $(n-2)$th house to avoid missing three consecutive houses, giving $a_{n-3}$ ways.\n\n## Step 5: Formulate the recursion\nThus, the recursive formula is $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$ for $n \\geq 4$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the values\nWe already have $a_1 = 2$, $a_2 = 4$, and $a_3 = 7$. We need to calculate $a_{10}$ using the recursive formula:\n- $a_4 = a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = 7 + 4 + 2 = 13$\n- $a_5 = a_4 + a_3 + a_2 = 13 + 7 + 4 = 24$\n- $a_6 = a_5 + a_4 + a_3 = 24 + 13 + 7 = 44$\n- $a_7 = a_6 + a_5 + a_4 = 44 + 24 + 13 = 81$\n- $a_8 = a_7 + a_6 + a_5 = 81 + 44 + 24 = 149$\n- $a_9 = a_8 + a_7 + a_6 = 149 + 81 + 44 = 274$\n- $a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 + a_7 = 274 + 149 + 81 = 504$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{504}$",

The base cases are $a_1 = 2$ (deliver or not deliver to the first house), $a_2 = 4$ (for each of the two houses, deliver or not deliver), and $a_3 = 7$ (as there are 7 combinations for three houses: deliver to all, miss one and deliver to the other two in 3 different ways, or deliver to one and miss the other two in 3 different ways, but we must exclude the case where all three are missed).\n\n## Step 4: Find the recursive formula\nFor $n$ houses, the paperboy can deliver a paper to the $n$th house or not. If he delivers to the $n$th house, there are $a_{n-1}$ ways to deliver papers to the previous $n-1$ houses. If he does not deliver to the $n$th house, he must deliver to the $(n-1)$th house to avoid missing three consecutive houses, giving $a_{n-2}$ ways for the first $n-2$ houses, or he must deliver to the $(n-2)$th house but not the $(n-1)$th, which is included in $a_{n-3}$ ways for the first $n-3$ houses. However, the correct recursive relationship to consider is that if he doesn't deliver to the $n$th house, he could either deliver to the $(n-1)$th (in which case we consider the $n-2$ case) or not deliver to the $(n-1)$th but deliver to the $(n-2)$th (which leads us back to the $n-3$ case). Therefore, the correct recursive formula considering all valid scenarios is $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$, because these cases cover all possible valid delivery sequences to $n$ houses.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $a_{10}$\nTo find $a_{10}$, we apply the recursive formula iteratively from $a_4$ up to $a_{10}$, using the base cases $a_1 = 2$, $a_2 = 4$, and $a_3 = 7$.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the recursive formula\n$a_4 = a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = 7 + 4 + 2 = 13$,\n$a_5 = a_4 + a_3 + a_2 = 13 + 7 + 4 = 24$,\n$a_6 = a_5 + a_4 + a_3 = 24 + 13 + 7 = 44$,\n$a_7 = a_6 + a_5 + a_4 = 44 + 24 + 13 = 81$,\n$a_8 = a_7 + a_6 + a_5 = 81 + 44 + 24 = 149$,\n$a_9 = a_8 + a_7 + a_6 = 149 + 81 + 44 = 274$,\n$a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 + a_7 = 274 + 149 + 81 = 504$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{504}$",
    "## Step 1: Define the problem and understand the constraints\nThe paperboy needs to deliver papers to 10 houses along Main Street. He never misses three consecutive houses, but he can skip one or two houses in a row. We need to compute the number of ways he can deliver papers under these conditions.\n\n## Step 2: Establish the base cases for the recursive relationship\nLet's denote $a_n$ as the number of ways the paperboy can deliver papers to $n$ houses without missing three consecutive houses. The base cases are when $n = 1$, $n = 2$, and $n = 3$. For $n = 1$, there are 2 ways: deliver or not deliver. For $n = 2$, there are 4 ways: deliver-deliver, deliver-not deliver, not deliver-deliver, and not deliver-not deliver. For $n = 3$, there are 7 ways: deliver-deliver-deliver, deliver-deliver-not deliver, deliver-not deliver-deliver, not deliver-deliver-deliver, deliver-not deliver-not deliver, not deliver-deliver-not deliver, and not deliver-not deliver-deliver. However, the not deliver-not deliver-not deliver sequence is not allowed.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the recursive relationship\nFor any $n > 3$, the number of ways the paperboy can deliver papers is the sum of the number of ways he can deliver papers to $n-1$ houses (if he delivers to the current house) and the number of ways he can deliver papers to $n-2$ houses (if he delivers to the current house after skipping one house) and the number of ways he can deliver papers to $n-3$ houses (if he delivers to the current house after skipping two houses). However, this thinking slightly overcomplicates the matter. A simpler way to look at it is that for $n$ houses, if the paperboy delivers to the first house, he has $a_{n-1}$ options for the rest. If he doesn't deliver to the first house, he must deliver to the second to avoid missing three in a row, giving him $a_{n-2}$ options for the rest if he delivers to the second house, and $a_{n-3}$ options if he skips the second as well but must deliver to the third.\n\n## Step 4: Correct the understanding of the recursive relationship\nHowever, the correct insight into the recursive relationship should focus on the last house. If the last house receives a paper, there are $a_{n-1}$ ways to deliver to the previous $n-1$ houses. If the last house does not receive a paper, then the second-to-last house must receive a paper to avoid three consecutive skips, leading to $a_{n-2}$ ways for the first $n-2$ houses. But if the last two houses do not receive papers, then the third-to-last house must receive a paper, giving $a_{n-3}$ ways for the first $n-3$ houses.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the initial values and set up the recursive formula\nThe initial values are $a_1 = 2$, $a_2 = 4$, and $a_3 = 7$. For $n > 3$, $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$, because these account for all possible scenarios of delivery to the last house(s) without missing three consecutive houses.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the recursive formula to find $a_{10}$\nTo find $a_{10}$, we need to calculate $a_4$ through $a_9$ using the recursive formula $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate $a_4$ to $a_{10}$\n- $a_4 = a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = 7 + 4 + 2 = 13$\n- $a_5 = a_4 + a_3 + a_2 = 13 + 7 + 4 = 24$\n- $a_6 = a_5 + a_4 + a_3 = 24 + 13 + 7 = 44$\n- $a_7 = a_6 + a_5 + a_4 = 44 + 24 + 13 = 81$\n- $a_8 = a_7 + a_6 + a_5 = 81 + 44 + 24 = 149$\n- $a_9 = a_8 + a_7 + a_6 = 149 + 81 + 44 = 274$\n- $a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 + a_7 = 274 + 149 + 81 = 504$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{504}$"

  "solution": "We can find a recursion. Let $D_n$ be the number of legal delivery sequences for $n$ houses. If a sequence ends with a delivery, we simply append one to $D_{n - 1}$. If it ends in $1$ nondelivery, we append a nondelivery and a delivery to $D_{n - 2}$. If it ends in $2$ nondeliveries, we append them and a delivery to $D_{n - 3}$. So\n$D_n = D_{n - 1} + D_{n - 2} + D_{n - 3}$.\nThus, since clearly $D_1 = 2$, $D_2 = 4$, $D_3 = 7$, we have $D_4 = 13$, $D_5 = 24$, $D_6 = 44$, $D_7 = 81$, $D_8 = 149$, $D_9 = 274$, $D_{10} = \\boxed{504}$.",
