    "## Step 1: Define the problem and understand the constraints\nWe need to find the number of 10-digit positive integers that have all digits either 1 or 2 and specifically have two consecutive 1's.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the total possible number of 10-digit integers with digits 1 or 2\nSince each digit can be either 1 or 2, for a 10-digit number, there are 2 possibilities for each digit. Thus, the total number of 10-digit integers with digits 1 or 2, regardless of consecutive 1's, is $2^{10}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of 10-digit integers with no consecutive 1's\nTo find the number of integers with two consecutive 1's, we can use the complement approach: find the total number of 10-digit integers with digits 1 or 2, and then subtract the number of 10-digit integers with no consecutive 1's.\n\nLet $a_n$ be the number of n-digit integers with no consecutive 1's and consisting only of the digits 1 and 2. We can derive a recursive formula for $a_n$ by considering how an n-digit number is formed from an (n-1)-digit number.\n\n## Step 4: Derive the recursive formula for $a_n$\nFor an n-digit number, if the last digit is 2, we can append it to any (n-1)-digit number without creating consecutive 1's, giving us $a_{n-1}$ possibilities. If the last digit is 1, it must be appended to an (n-1)-digit number that ends in 2 to avoid consecutive 1's. The number of (n-1)-digit numbers ending in 2 can be derived from the number of (n-2)-digit numbers (since we can append '2' to any of those), which gives us $a_{n-2}$ possibilities.\n\nThus, the recursive formula is $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the recursive formula with initial conditions\nWe know $a_1 = 2$ (since the single digit can be either 1 or 2) and $a_2 = 3$ (since the two-digit numbers can be 11, 12, or 22). Using the recursive formula $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$, we can calculate $a_{10}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $a_{10}$\nFollowing the recursive formula:\n- $a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 3 + 2 = 5$\n- $a_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 5 + 3 = 8$\n- $a_5 = a_4 + a_3 = 8 + 5 = 13$\n- $a_6 = a_5 + a_4 = 13 + 8 = 21$\n- $a_7 = a_6 + a_5 = 21 + 13 = 34$\n- $a_8 = a_7 + a_6 = 34 + 21 = 55$\n- $a_9 = a_8 + a_7 = 55 + 34 = 89$\n- $a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 = 89 + 55 = 144$\n\n## Step 7: Find the number of 10-digit integers with two consecutive 1's\nThe total number of 10-digit integers with digits 1 or 2 is $2^{10} = 1024$. The number of 10-digit integers with no consecutive 1's is $a_{10} = 144$. Therefore, the number of 10-digit integers with two consecutive 1's is $1024 - 144 = 880$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{880}$",
    "## Step 1: Define the problem and understand the constraints\nWe are looking for 10-digit positive integers that consist only of the digits 1 or 2 and have two consecutive 1's. This means we need to find the total count of such numbers.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the approach to solve the problem\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of complementary counting, where we first find the total number of 10-digit integers with digits 1 or 2, and then subtract the number of 10-digit integers with no consecutive 1's.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of 10-digit integers with digits 1 or 2\nSince each digit can be either 1 or 2, there are 2 possibilities for each of the 10 digits. Therefore, the total number of 10-digit integers with digits 1 or 2 is $2^{10} = 1024$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of 10-digit integers with no consecutive 1's\nLet's define $a_n$ as the number of $n$-digit integers with no consecutive 1's and consisting only of the digits 1 and 2. We can derive a recursive formula for $a_n$ by considering the last digit. If the last digit is 2, then the preceding $n-1$ digits can be any combination without consecutive 1's, giving $a_{n-1}$ possibilities. If the last digit is 1, then the second-to-last digit must be 2 to avoid consecutive 1's, and the preceding $n-2$ digits can be any combination without consecutive 1's, giving $a_{n-2}$ possibilities. Therefore, $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the initial conditions for the recursion\nThe initial conditions are $a_1 = 2$ (since the single digit can be either 1 or 2) and $a_2 = 3$ (since the two digits can be 11, 12, or 22).\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $a_{10}$ using the recursive formula\nUsing the recursive formula $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and the initial conditions, we can calculate $a_{10}$ step by step:\n- $a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 3 + 2 = 5$\n- $a_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 5 + 3 = 8$\n- $a_5 = a_4 + a_3 = 8 + 5 = 13$\n- $a_6 = a_5 + a_4 = 13 + 8 = 21$\n- $a_7 = a_6 + a_5 = 21 + 13 = 34$\n- $a_8 = a_7 + a_6 = 34 + 21 = 55$\n- $a_9 = a_8 + a_7 = 55 + 34 = 89$\n- $a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 = 89 + 55 = 144$\n\n## Step 7: Find the number of 10-digit integers with two consecutive 1's\nThe number of 10-digit integers with two consecutive 1's is the total number of 10-digit integers with digits 1 or 2 minus the number of 10-digit integers with no consecutive 1's, which is $2^{10} - a_{10} = 1024 - 144$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the final answer\n$1024 - 144 = 880$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{880}$",

Let's find the number of 10-digit integers with no consecutive 1's and then subtract this from the total number of possible integers.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the complement approach using recursion or dynamic programming\nLet $a_n$ be the number of n-digit integers with no consecutive 1's. We can derive a recursive relation for $a_n$ by considering the last digit. If the last digit is 2, we can append it to any $(n-1)$-digit integer with no consecutive 1's, giving us $a_{n-1}$ possibilities. If the last digit is 1, the second-to-last digit must be 2, so we can append \"21\" to any $(n-2)$-digit integer with no consecutive 1's, giving us $a_{n-2}$ possibilities. Therefore, $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the recursive relation\nWe know that $a_1 = 2$ (both 1 and 2 are allowed) and $a_2 = 3$ (11 is not allowed, but 12, 21, and 22 are allowed). Using the recursive relation $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$, we can calculate $a_{10}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $a_{10}$\nFollowing the recursive relation: $a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 3 + 2 = 5$, $a_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 5 + 3 = 8$, $a_5 = a_4 + a_3 = 8 + 5 = 13$, $a_6 = a_5 + a_4 = 13 + 8 = 21$, $a_7 = a_6 + a_5 = 21 + 13 = 34$, $a_8 = a_7 + a_6 = 34 + 21 = 55$, $a_9 = a_8 + a_7 = 55 + 34 = 89$, $a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 = 89 + 55 = 144$.\n\n## Step 7: Find the number of 10-digit integers with two consecutive 1's\nThe total number of 10-digit integers with two consecutive 1's is the total number of possible integers minus the number of integers with no consecutive 1's, which is $2^{10} - a_{10} = 1024 - 144$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the final answer\n$1024 - 144 = 880$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{880}$"

  "solution": "We take as our universe the set of 10-digit integers whose digits are all either 1 or 2, of which there are $2^{10}$, and we count the complement. The complement is the set of 10-digit positive integers composed of the digits 1 and 2 with no two consecutive 1s. Counting such numbers is a popular combinatorial problem: we approach it via a recursion.\nThere are two \"good\" one-digit numbers (1 and 2) and three good two-digit numbers (12, 21 and 22). Each such $n$-digit number is formed either by gluing \"2\" on to the end of a good $(n - 1)$-digit number or by gluing \"21\" onto the end of a good $(n - 2)$-digit number. This is a bijection between the good $n$-digit numbers and the union of the good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. Thus, the number of good $n$-digit numbers is the sum of the number of good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. The resulting recursion is exactly that of the Fibonacci numbers with initial values $F_1 = 2$ and $F_2 = 3$.\nThus, our final answer is $2^{10} - F_{10} = 1024 - 144 = \\boxed{880}$.",
