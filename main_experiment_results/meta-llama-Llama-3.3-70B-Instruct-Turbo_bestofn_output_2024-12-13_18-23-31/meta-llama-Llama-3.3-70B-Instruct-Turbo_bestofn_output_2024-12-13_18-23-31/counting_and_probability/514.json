  "problem": "License plates from different states follow different alpha-numeric formats, which dictate which characters of a plate must be letters and which must be numbers. Florida has license plates with an alpha-numeric format like the one pictured. North Dakota, on the other hand, has a different format, also pictured. Assuming all 10 digits are equally likely to appear in the numeric positions, and all 26 letters are equally likely to appear in the alpha positions, how many more license plates can Florida issue than North Dakota?

    "## Step 1: Determine the format for each state's license plate.\nFlorida's format is given as three letters, followed by two numbers, and then one letter (e.g., HJF 94K), while North Dakota's format is three letters, followed by three numbers (e.g., DGT 317).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of license plates Florida can issue.\nFor Florida, there are 26 possibilities for each of the first three letters, 10 possibilities for each of the next two numbers, and 26 possibilities for the last letter. Therefore, the total number of license plates Florida can issue is $26^3 \\times 10^2 \\times 26 = 26^4 \\times 10^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of license plates North Dakota can issue.\nFor North Dakota, there are 26 possibilities for each of the first three letters, and 10 possibilities for each of the next three numbers. Therefore, the total number of license plates North Dakota can issue is $26^3 \\times 10^3$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the difference in the number of license plates that can be issued between the two states.\nThe difference in the number of license plates is $26^4 \\times 10^2 - 26^3 \\times 10^3$. This can be simplified by factoring out $26^3 \\times 10^2$, resulting in $26^3 \\times 10^2 (26 - 10)$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the calculation to find the numerical difference.\nSubstituting the values into the equation gives us $26^3 \\times 10^2 \\times 16$. Calculating $26^3$ first yields $17576$, then multiplying by $10^2$ gives $1757600$, and finally multiplying by $16$ results in $28121600$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28121600}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the formats of the license plates for Florida and North Dakota.\nThe problem asks us to find the difference in the number of license plates that can be issued by Florida and North Dakota, given their respective alpha-numeric formats. Florida's format has 3 letters, followed by 2 numbers, and then 1 letter, while North Dakota's format has 3 letters, followed by 3 numbers.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of license plates that can be issued by Florida.\nFor Florida, there are 26 possible letters for each of the 4 letter positions (since there are 26 letters in the alphabet) and 10 possible digits for each of the 2 numeric positions (since there are 10 digits from 0 to 9). Therefore, the total number of license plates that can be issued by Florida is $26^4 \\times 10^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of license plates that can be issued by North Dakota.\nFor North Dakota, there are 26 possible letters for each of the 3 letter positions and 10 possible digits for each of the 3 numeric positions. Therefore, the total number of license plates that can be issued by North Dakota is $26^3 \\times 10^3$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the difference in the number of license plates that can be issued by Florida and North Dakota.\nTo find the difference, subtract the total number of license plates that can be issued by North Dakota from the total number that can be issued by Florida: $26^4 \\times 10^2 - 26^3 \\times 10^3$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression to find the numerical difference.\n$26^4 \\times 10^2 - 26^3 \\times 10^3 = 26^3 \\times 26 \\times 10^2 - 26^3 \\times 10^3 = 26^3 \\times (26 \\times 10^2 - 10^3)$.\n\n## Step 6: Further simplify the expression.\n$26^3 \\times (26 \\times 10^2 - 10^3) = 26^3 \\times (2600 - 1000) = 26^3 \\times 1600$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate $26^3$.\n$26^3 = 26 \\times 26 \\times 26 = 17576$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the final difference.\n$26^3 \\times 1600 = 17576 \\times 1600 = 28121600$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28121600}$",

  "critique": "Solution 1 is the most straightforward and easiest to follow, but Solution 2 provides a bit more detail in the steps and Solution 3 is similar to Solution 1.

  "solution": "Florida issues license plates in which the first three and last slots are filled with letters, and the fourth and fifth are filled with digits. Thus, there are $26^4 \\cdot 10^2$ Florida license plates possible. North Dakota, however, issues license plates in which the first three slots are filled with letters and the last three slots are filled with digits. There are thus $26^3 \\cdot 10^3$ possible North Dakota license plates. Multiplying these out and taking the difference yields an answer of $\\boxed{28121600}$.",
