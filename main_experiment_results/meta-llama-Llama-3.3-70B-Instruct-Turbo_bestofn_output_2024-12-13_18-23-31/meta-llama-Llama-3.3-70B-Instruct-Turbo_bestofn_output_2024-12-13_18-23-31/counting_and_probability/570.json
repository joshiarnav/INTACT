    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling four six-sided dice.\nWhen rolling four dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes. Since the rolls of the dice are independent, the total number of outcomes for all four dice is $6^4 = 1296$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to roll the same number of 1's and 6's.\nTo have more 1's than 6's, we first need to consider the cases where Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's, as these will be excluded from the successful outcomes. This can happen in three ways: rolling two of each, rolling one of each, or rolling none of each.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to roll two 1's and two 6's.\nThe number of ways to choose which two of the four dice roll 1's (and thus the other two roll 6's) is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$. For each of these combinations, the other two dice can roll any of the four remaining numbers (2, 3, 4, 5), giving $4^2 = 16$ possibilities for the remaining dice. However, we are only considering the cases where the dice show either 1 or 6, so there are no additional possibilities for the other two dice. Thus, there are $6$ ways to roll two 1's and two 6's.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to roll one 1 and one 6.\nThe number of ways to choose which one of the four dice rolls a 1 is $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$, and then we choose which one of the remaining three dice rolls a 6, which can be done in $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways. The remaining two dice can each be any of the four numbers 2, 3, 4, or 5, giving $4^2 = 16$ possibilities for these dice. Thus, there are $4 \\times 3 \\times 16 = 192$ ways to roll one 1 and one 6.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to roll no 1's or 6's.\nFor each of the four dice, there are 4 possible outcomes (2, 3, 4, 5) that are neither 1 nor 6, giving $4^4 = 256$ ways to roll no 1's or 6's.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of successful outcomes where Greg rolls more 1's than 6's.\nThe total number of ways to roll more 1's than 6's can be found by considering the complement: the total number of outcomes minus the outcomes where Greg rolls an equal number of 1's and 6's or more 6's than 1's. However, due to symmetry, the number of ways to roll more 1's than 6's is equal to the number of ways to roll more 6's than 1's. The number of ways to roll the same number of 1's and 6's is $6 + 192 + 256 = 454$. The total number of outcomes where Greg rolls more 1's than 6's or more 6's than 1's is $1296 - 454 = 842$. By symmetry, half of these outcomes will have more 1's than 6's, so there are $842 / 2 = 421$ successful outcomes.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's.\nThe probability of rolling more 1's than 6's is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is $421 / 1296$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{421}{1296}}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of outcomes when rolling four dice.\nWhen rolling four six-sided dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes. Since we are rolling four dice, the total number of outcomes is $6^4 = 1296$.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the symmetry between rolling 1's and 6's.\nThe probability of rolling more 1's than 6's is the same as rolling more 6's than 1's due to symmetry. This means we can calculate the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's and then multiply it by 2 to account for the reverse scenario, but we also need to consider the scenario where the number of 1's and 6's are equal.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of rolling an equal number of 1's and 6's.\nTo find the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's, we first need to calculate the probability of rolling an equal number of 1's and 6's, which includes the scenarios of rolling two of each, one of each, or none of each. However, calculating this directly can be complex.\n\n## Step 4: Use the complement principle to simplify the calculation.\nInstead of directly calculating the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's, we can use the fact that the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes is 1. This includes the scenarios of rolling more 1's than 6's, more 6's than 1's, and an equal number of 1's and 6's.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of rolling an equal number of 1's and 6's.\nThe probability of rolling an equal number of 1's and 6's can be further broken down into cases: rolling two of each, one of each, or none of each. Calculating each case separately is necessary.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of rolling two 1's and two 6's.\nThe number of ways to choose which two of the four dice show 1's (and thus the other two show 6's) is $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$. The probability of each of these specific outcomes is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^4$. So, the probability of rolling two 1's and two 6's is $6 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^4 = \\frac{6}{1296}$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability of rolling one 1 and one 6.\nThe number of ways to choose which one of the four dice shows a 1 (and which one shows a 6) is $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1} = 12$. The remaining two dice can each be any of the four other numbers (2, 3, 4, 5), so there are $4^2 = 16$ possibilities for the remaining dice. The probability of each of these specific outcomes is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{4}{6}\\right)^2$. So, the probability of rolling one 1 and one 6 is $12 \\times 16 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{4}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{12 \\times 16 \\times 4^2}{6^4} = \\frac{384}{1296}$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the probability of rolling no 1's or 6's.\nThe probability that none of the four dice shows a 1 or a 6 is $\\left(\\frac{4}{6}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 = \\frac{16}{81}$.\n\n## Step 9: Sum the probabilities of equal 1's and 6's scenarios.\nThe total probability of rolling an equal number of 1's and 6's is the sum of the probabilities calculated in steps 6, 7, and 8: $\\frac{6}{1296} + \\frac{384}{1296} + \\frac{16}{81}$. Converting $\\frac{16}{81}$ to have a denominator of 1296, $\\frac{16}{81} = \\frac{16 \\times 16}{81 \\times 16} = \\frac{256}{1296}$. So, the sum is $\\frac{6 + 384 + 256}{1296} = \\frac{646}{1296}$.\n\n## Step 10: Apply the complement principle.\nGiven that the probability of all outcomes must sum to 1, and knowing the probability of rolling an equal number of 1's and 6's, we can find the combined probability of rolling more 1's than 6's or more 6's than 1's. The probability of not rolling an equal number of 1's and 6's is $1 - \\frac{646}{1296} = \\frac{650}{1296}$.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's.\nSince the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's is the same as rolling more 6's than 1's due to symmetry, and together they make up the probability of not rolling an equal number of 1's and 6's, we divide the probability of not rolling an equal number by 2. So, the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{650}{1296}$.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the final probability.\nThe probability of rolling more 1's than 6's simplifies to $\\frac{650}{2 \\times 1296} = \\frac{325}{1296}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{325}{1296}}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of outcomes when rolling four dice.\nWhen rolling four six-sided dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the total number of outcomes for four dice is $6^4 = 1296$.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the symmetry between rolling 1's and 6's.\nSince the dice are fair, the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's is the same as rolling more 6's than 1's. Let's denote the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's as $P(1>6)$, the probability of rolling more 6's than 1's as $P(6>1)$, and the probability of rolling an equal number of 1's and 6's as $P(1=6)$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of rolling an equal number of 1's and 6's.\nTo calculate $P(1=6)$, we need to consider the cases where Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's. This can happen in the following ways: rolling two 1's and two 6's, rolling one 1 and one 6, or rolling no 1's or 6's.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to roll two 1's and two 6's.\nThe number of ways to choose which two of the four dice roll 1's (and thus the other two roll 6's) is given by the combination formula $C(4,2) = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6$. For each of these combinations, the other two dice can be any of the remaining four numbers (2, 3, 4, 5), so there are $4^2 = 16$ possibilities for the other two dice. However, we are only considering the case where all four dice show either 1 or 6, so there is only 1 possibility for each die, resulting in $C(4,2) = 6$ ways to roll two 1's and two 6's.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to roll one 1 and one 6.\nThe number of ways to choose which one of the four dice rolls a 1 is $C(4,1) = 4$, and then there are $C(3,1) = 3$ ways to choose which of the remaining dice rolls a 6. The other two dice can be any of the four numbers (2, 3, 4, 5), resulting in $4^2 = 16$ possibilities. So, the total number of ways to roll one 1 and one 6 is $C(4,1) \\times C(3,1) \\times 4^2 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 16 = 192$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to roll no 1's or 6's.\nThe number of ways for all four dice to show neither a 1 nor a 6 is $4^4 = 256$ since each die has 4 possible outcomes (2, 3, 4, 5).\n\n## Step 7: Sum the outcomes for equal numbers of 1's and 6's and calculate $P(1=6)$.\nThe total number of ways to roll an equal number of 1's and 6's is $6 + 192 + 256 = 454$. Therefore, $P(1=6) = \\frac{454}{1296}$.\n\n## Step 8: Use the symmetry to find $P(1>6)$.\nGiven that $P(1>6) = P(6>1)$ and $P(1>6) + P(6>1) + P(1=6) = 1$, we can find $P(1>6)$. Since $P(1=6) = \\frac{454}{1296}$, $P(1>6) + P(1>6) = 1 - \\frac{454}{1296}$, which simplifies to $2P(1>6) = \\frac{842}{1296}$.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for $P(1>6)$.\nDividing both sides by 2 gives $P(1>6) = \\frac{842}{2592} = \\frac{211}{648}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{211}{648}}$"

  "critique": "## Step 1: Evaluate Solution 1 for correctness and completeness.\nSolution 1 provides a detailed step-by-step approach to calculating the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's when four fair six-sided dice are rolled. It correctly identifies the total number of outcomes and attempts to calculate the number of successful outcomes by considering the complement principle and symmetry.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate Solution 2 for correctness and completeness.\nSolution 2 also approaches the problem by considering symmetry and the complement principle.

  "solution": "We notice that the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's must equal the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's. So, we can find the probability that Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's, subtract it from 1, and divide by 2 to find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's. There are three ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's: he can roll two of each, one of each, or none of each. If he rolls two of each, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which two dice roll the 1's. If he rolls one of each, there are $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1}=12$ ways to choose which dice are the 6 and the 1, and for each of those ways there are $4\\cdot4=16$ ways to choose the values of the other dice. If Greg rolls no 1's or 6's, there are $4^4=256$ possible values for the dice. In total, there are $6+12\\cdot16+256=454$ ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's. There are $6^4=1296$ total ways the four dice can roll, so the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\left(1-\\dfrac{454}{1296}\\right)=\\boxed{\\dfrac{421}{1296}}$.",
