    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of integers between 9 and 100.\nThere are 90 integers in total from 10 to 99, since 10 is the smallest two-digit integer and 99 is the largest.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of integers where the digits are the same.\nThese integers are 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99. So, there are 9 integers where both digits are the same.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of integers where the digits are different.\nTo find the number of integers with different digits, subtract the number of integers with the same digits from the total number of integers. So, 90 - 9 = 81 integers have different digits.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of choosing an integer with different digits.\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. So, the probability = 81 / 90.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the probability fraction.\nThe fraction 81 / 90 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9. Thus, 81 / 9 = 9 and 90 / 9 = 10, so the simplified fraction is 9 / 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$",
