    "## Step 1: Determine the probability of the first card being a 6.\nThere are 4 sixes (6 of hearts, 6 of clubs, 6 of spades, 6 of diamonds) in a standard deck of 52 cards. So, the probability of drawing a 6 as the first card is 4 out of 52.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of the first card being a 6.\nThe probability of the first card being a 6 is 4/52, which simplifies to 1/13.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the probability of the second card being a Queen.\nAfter drawing the first card, there are 51 cards left in the deck. Among these, there are 4 Queens (Queen of hearts, Queen of clubs, Queen of spades, Queen of diamonds). So, the probability of drawing a Queen as the second card is 4 out of 51.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of the second card being a Queen.\nThe probability of the second card being a Queen is 4/51.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the overall probability of both events happening.\nTo find the probability of both events happening (first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen), we multiply the probabilities of the two events.\n\n## Step 6: Multiply the probabilities of the first and second events.\nThe probability of the first card being a 6 and the second card being a Queen is (1/13) * (4/51).\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression.\n(1/13) * (4/51) = 4/(13*51) = 4/663.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{663}}$",
    "## Step 1: Calculate the probability of the first card being a 6\nThere are 4 sixes in a standard deck of 52 cards (one for each suit: hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds). The probability of drawing a 6 as the first card is therefore 4 out of 52, which simplifies to 1/13.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of the second card being a Queen\nAfter the first card is drawn, there are 51 cards remaining in the deck. Among these, there are 4 Queens (one for each suit). Thus, the probability of drawing a Queen as the second card, given that the first card was a 6, is 4 out of 51.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the combined probability of both events happening\nTo find the probability of both events occurring (the first card being a 6 and the second card being a Queen), we multiply the probabilities of each event happening in sequence. This means multiplying the probability of the first card being a 6 by the probability of the second card being a Queen.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the multiplication\nThe probability of the first card being a 6 is 1/13, and the probability of the second card being a Queen is 4/51. Multiplying these probabilities gives (1/13) * (4/51).\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression\nMultiplying the fractions (1/13) * (4/51) gives 4/(13*51), which simplifies to 4/663.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{663}}$",

The probability of drawing a 6 as the first card is therefore 4 out of 52, which can be expressed as 4/52.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of the second card being a Queen\nAfter the first card is drawn, there are 51 cards remaining in the deck. There are 4 Queens in the deck. The probability of drawing a Queen as the second card, given that the first card was a 6, is 4 out of 51, since regardless of the first card, there are still 4 Queens in the deck unless the first card was a Queen, which is not the case here since the first card is a 6. So, this probability is 4/51.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the combined probability of both events happening\nTo find the probability that both events occur (the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen), we multiply the probabilities of the two events. So, the combined probability is (4/52) * (4/51).\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression for the combined probability\nWe simplify (4/52) * (4/51). First, simplify 4/52 to 1/13 (since both numerator and denominator can be divided by 4). So, we have (1/13) * (4/51).\n\n## Step 5: Perform the multiplication\n(1/13) * (4/51) = 4/(13*51) = 4/663.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{663}}$"
