    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and constraints\nWe have a $4 \\times 4$ chessboard and need to place four distinct pawns in such a way that no row or column contains more than one pawn.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the placement process\nTo ensure that each row and column contains no more than one pawn, we can think of placing the pawns one by one, considering the available rows and columns for each placement.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to place the first pawn\nFor the first pawn, we can choose any of the $4 \\times 4 = 16$ squares on the board. So, there are 16 ways to place the first pawn.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to place the second pawn\nAfter placing the first pawn, for the second pawn, we have to choose from the remaining $3 \\times 3 = 9$ squares (since one row and one column are now occupied). So, there are 9 ways to place the second pawn.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to place the third pawn\nAfter placing the first two pawns, for the third pawn, we have to choose from the remaining $2 \\times 2 = 4$ squares (since two rows and two columns are now occupied). So, there are 4 ways to place the third pawn.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to place the fourth pawn\nAfter placing the first three pawns, there is only $1 \\times 1 = 1$ square left for the fourth pawn (since three rows and three columns are now occupied). So, there is 1 way to place the fourth pawn.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the multiplication principle to find the total number of ways\nThe total number of ways to place the four distinct pawns on the board is the product of the number of ways to place each pawn: $16 \\times 9 \\times 4 \\times 1 = 576$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{576}$",
    "## Step 1: Understanding the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the number of ways to place four distinct pawns on a $4\\times 4$ chess board such that each column and row contains no more than one pawn.\n\n## Step 2: Breaking down the problem\nTo solve this, we can think of it as a series of choices. For the first pawn, we have $4 \\times 4 = 16$ possible positions to place it since the board is empty.\n\n## Step 3: Considering subsequent pawns\nAfter placing the first pawn, for the second pawn, we will have fewer choices because we cannot place it in the same row or column as the first pawn. This means that for the second pawn, we will have $3 \\times 3 = 9$ possible positions.\n\n## Step 4: Further reducing choices for the next pawns\nFollowing the same logic, after placing the first two pawns, the third pawn will have $2 \\times 2 = 4$ possible positions since two rows and two columns are now restricted.\n\n## Step 5: Final pawn placement\nFor the last pawn, there will only be $1 \\times 1 = 1$ possible position left, as three rows and three columns will be restricted by the first three pawns.\n\n## Step 6: Calculating total possibilities\nHowever, since the pawns are distinct, we need to consider the order in which they are placed. The total number of ways to place the pawns is the product of the number of choices at each step: $16 \\times 9 \\times 4 \\times 1$.\n\n## Step 7: Accounting for overcounting\nBut we must remember that the order of placement doesn't matter for the final arrangement. Since there are $4!$ ways to order the four distinct pawns, we have overcounted by a factor of $4!$.\n\n## Step 8: Correcting for overcounting\nThe correct calculation should consider the distinctness of the pawns but also account for the fact that the order of placement does not affect the final arrangement. Therefore, we actually calculate the total number of arrangements without needing to adjust for overcounting because each step of placement uniquely leads to a distinct final arrangement due to the pawns' distinctness.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{576}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe have a $4 \\times 4$ chessboard, and we need to place four distinct pawns on the board such that each column and row contains no more than one pawn.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of ways to place the first pawn\nFor the first pawn, we have $4 \\times 4 = 16$ possible positions to place it since the board is empty and there are no restrictions yet.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to place the second pawn\nAfter placing the first pawn, for the second pawn, we have $3 \\times 3 = 9$ possible positions. This is because one row and one column are already occupied by the first pawn, leaving 3 rows and 3 columns where the second pawn can be placed.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the number of ways to place the third pawn\nAfter placing the first two pawns, for the third pawn, we have $2 \\times 2 = 4$ possible positions. With two pawns on the board, two rows and two columns are occupied, leaving 2 rows and 2 columns available for the third pawn.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the number of ways to place the fourth pawn\nAfter placing the first three pawns, there is only $1 \\times 1 = 1$ possible position left for the fourth pawn. Three rows and three columns are occupied by the first three pawns, leaving only one position available.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of ways to place all four pawns\nTo find the total number of ways to place the four distinct pawns, we multiply the number of ways to place each pawn: $16 \\times 9 \\times 4 \\times 1 = 576$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{576}$"

  "solution": "Because our chess board is $4 \\times 4$, there must be exactly one pawn in each column and each row. Consider the ways to place one pawn in each row. In the first row, there are four potential spots for a pawn. However, no matter where we place the pawn, it takes up one column. So, in the second row, there are only three potential spots for a pawn. Similarly, there are two spots in the third row and only one in the fourth. Thus, there are $4\\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 24$ ways in which we can place the pawns. Now, because each pawn is distinct, we have four possible pawns to place in the first slot, three in the second, two in the fourth, and one in the last. So there are $24$ possible orderings of the pawns. Our final answer is thus $24^2 = \\boxed{576}$.",
