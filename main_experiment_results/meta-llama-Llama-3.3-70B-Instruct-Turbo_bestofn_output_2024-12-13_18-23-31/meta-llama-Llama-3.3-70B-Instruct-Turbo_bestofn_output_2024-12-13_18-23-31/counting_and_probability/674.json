    "## Step 1: Determine the number of color options for each stripe\nThere are 2 possible colors for each stripe: purple and gold.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of possibilities for the first stripe\nSince there are 2 possible colors, there are 2 possibilities for the first stripe.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of possibilities for the second stripe\nThe second stripe can also be either of the 2 colors, regardless of the color chosen for the first stripe. So, there are 2 possibilities for the second stripe.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of possibilities for the third stripe\nSimilarly, the third stripe can be either of the 2 colors, regardless of the colors chosen for the first and second stripes. So, there are 2 possibilities for the third stripe.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of possible flag combinations\nTo find the total number of possible flag combinations, multiply the number of possibilities for each stripe together: $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
