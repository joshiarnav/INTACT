    "## Step 1: Identify the colors of socks and their quantities.\nThere are 3 colors of socks: white (4 socks), brown (4 socks), and blue (2 socks).\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of ways to choose a pair of socks for each color.\nFor white socks, the number of ways to choose a pair is the combination of 4 socks taken 2 at a time, which is calculated as C(4, 2) = (4 * 3) / (2 * 1) = 6.\nFor brown socks, similarly, the number of ways to choose a pair is C(4, 2) = (4 * 3) / (2 * 1) = 6.\nFor blue socks, the number of ways to choose a pair is C(2, 2) = (2 * 1) / (2 * 1) = 1.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color.\nThe total number of ways is the sum of the ways to choose a pair for each color: 6 (white) + 6 (brown) + 1 (blue) = 13.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the types of socks and their quantities.\nThere are 3 types of socks: white, brown, and blue, with quantities 4, 4, and 2, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of white socks.\nTo choose a pair of white socks from the 4 available, we use the combination formula $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $k$ is the number of items to choose. For white socks, $n = 4$ and $k = 2$, so the number of ways to choose a pair of white socks is $C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\cdot 2} = 6$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of brown socks.\nSimilarly, for brown socks, $n = 4$ and $k = 2$, so the number of ways to choose a pair of brown socks is also $C(4, 2) = 6$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of blue socks.\nFor blue socks, $n = 2$ and $k = 2$, so the number of ways to choose a pair of blue socks is $C(2, 2) = \\frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Sum the number of ways to choose pairs of each color to get the total number of ways.\nTo get the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color, we add the results from steps 2, 3, and 4: $6 + 6 + 1 = 13$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to choose a pair of white socks.\nTo choose a pair of white socks from the 4 available, we use the combination formula since the order in which we choose the socks does not matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, the product of all positive integers up to that number. For white socks, n = 4 and k = 2.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of white socks using the combination formula.\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 24 / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to choose a pair of brown socks.\nSimilar to Step 1, we have 4 brown socks, and we want to choose 2 of them. We use the same combination formula with n = 4 and k = 2.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of brown socks.\nThis calculation is the same as for the white socks because we have the same number of brown socks as white socks. So, C(4, 2) for brown socks is also 6.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the number of ways to choose a pair of blue socks.\nWe have 2 blue socks, and we want to choose 2 of them. Using the combination formula with n = 2 and k = 2.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of blue socks.\nC(2, 2) = 2! / (2!(2-2)!) = 2 / (2 * 1) = 1.\n\n## Step 7: Add up all the ways to choose pairs of socks of the same color.\nTo get the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color, we add the results from Steps 2, 4, and 6: 6 (white) + 6 (brown) + 1 (blue) = 13.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$"

  "solution": "The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue.  If the socks are white, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are brown, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are blue, there is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ choice.  So the total number of choices for socks is $6 + 6 + 1 = \\boxed{13}$.",
