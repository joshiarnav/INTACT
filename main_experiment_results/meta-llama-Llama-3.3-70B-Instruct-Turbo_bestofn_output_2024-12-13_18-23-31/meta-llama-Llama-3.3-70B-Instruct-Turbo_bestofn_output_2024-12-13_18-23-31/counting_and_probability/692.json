    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the formula for combinations\nTo compute $\\dbinom{10}{5}$, we need to understand what this expression means. It represents the number of ways to choose 5 items out of 10 without regard to order. The formula for combinations is $\\dbinom{n}{r} = \\dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n!$ denotes the factorial of $n$, which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the formula for combinations to the given problem\nFor our problem, $n = 10$ and $r = 5$. Plugging these values into the formula gives us $\\dbinom{10}{5} = \\dfrac{10!}{5!(10-5)!}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the factorials and calculate\nNow, we simplify the expression by calculating the factorials. $10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$, $5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$, and $(10-5)! = 5!$. So, the expression becomes $\\dfrac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}$ because the $5!$ in the denominator cancels out the last 5 numbers of $10!$.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the multiplication and division\nWe then perform the multiplication and division: $\\dfrac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\dfrac{30240}{120}$.\n\n## Step 5: Final calculation\nFinally, we do the final division to get $\\dfrac{30240}{120} = 252$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{252}$",

For this problem, we need to compute $\\dbinom{10}{5}$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the formula for combination\nSubstitute $n = 10$ and $r = 5$ into the combination formula: $\\dbinom{10}{5} = \\dfrac{10!}{5!(10-5)!}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate factorials\nCalculate the factorial of each number involved in the formula. $10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$, $5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$, and $(10-5)! = 5!$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression\nWe can simplify the expression by canceling out common factors in the numerator and denominator.

Calculate one $5!$: $5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$. Since we have $5!$ twice in the denominator, we square this result: $120 \\times 120 = 14400$.\n\n## Step 6: Divide the numerator by the denominator\nFinally, divide the result from the numerator by the result from the denominator: $\\dfrac{30240}{14400}$.\n\n## Step 7: Final calculation\nPerform the final division to get the result of the combination: $\\dfrac{30240}{14400} = 2.1$. However, since combinations result in whole numbers (as they represent counts of ways to choose items), there was a miscalculation in simplifying the factorials and calculating the result.\n\n## Step 8: Correct simplification and calculation\nLet's correct the calculation by properly simplifying the factorials and then computing the result. Given $\\dbinom{10}{5} = \\dfrac{10!}{5!5!}$, we simplify it to $\\dfrac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}$ because the $5!$ in the numerator and one of the $5!$ in the denominator cancel out.\n\n## Step 9: Final calculation\nCalculate the numerator and denominator correctly: Numerator = $10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 = 30240$, Denominator = $5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$.
