    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of colors available\nGeorge has 7 different colors to choose from for painting his room.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the number of colors George wants to choose\nGeorge wants to choose 2 colors out of the 7 available.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the combination formula to find the number of ways\nThe number of ways to choose 2 colors out of 7 can be calculated using the combination formula: $C(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the combination\nSubstituting n = 7 (total colors) and r = 2 (colors to choose) into the combination formula: $C(7, 2) = \\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \\frac{7!}{2!5!}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the factorial expressions\nCalculate the factorials: $7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040$, $2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2$, and $5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute the factorial values into the formula\nPlug the factorial values into the combination formula: $C(7, 2) = \\frac{5040}{2 \\times 120} = \\frac{5040}{240}$.\n\n## Step 7: Perform the final division\nCalculate the final result: $C(7, 2) = \\frac{5040}{240} = 21$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the type of problem\nThis is a combination problem, where George needs to choose 2 colors out of 7 available colors. The order in which the colors are chosen does not matter.\n\n## Step 2: Use the combination formula\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the combination formula to the problem\nHere, n = 7 (total number of colors) and k = 2 (number of colors to choose). So, we calculate C(7, 2) = 7! / [2!(7-2)!].\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the factorials\n7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040,\n2! = 2 * 1 = 2,\n(7-2)! = 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n\n## Step 5: Plug the factorials into the combination formula\nC(7, 2) = 5040 / [2 * 120] = 5040 / 240.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression\nC(7, 2) = 5040 / 240 = 21.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nGeorge needs to choose two colors out of seven to paint his room. This is a combination problem, because the order of the colors does not matter.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the formula for combinations\nThe formula for combinations is given by: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items to choose from, r is the number of items to choose, and '!' denotes factorial, the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given number.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the formula to the problem\nIn this scenario, n = 7 (since there are seven colors) and r = 2 (since George is choosing two colors). So, we need to calculate C(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!) = 7! / (2!5!).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the factorials\n7! = 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5040, 2! = 2 x 1 = 2, and 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute the factorial values into the formula\nC(7, 2) = 5040 / (2 x 120) = 5040 / 240.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final value\n5040 / 240 = 21.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$"
