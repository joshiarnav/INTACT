    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of cards in a standard deck and the number of $\\diamondsuit$ cards.\nA standard deck contains 52 cards, with 13 cards in each suit. Since there are 4 suits ($\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, $\\clubsuit$, and $\\spadesuit$), and we're interested in $\\diamondsuit$ cards, there are 13 $\\diamondsuit$ cards.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of drawing a $\\diamondsuit$ card first.\nThe probability of the first card being a $\\diamondsuit$ is the number of $\\diamondsuit$ cards divided by the total number of cards, which is $\\frac{13}{52}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ace cards in the deck and consider two scenarios for the second draw.\nThere are 4 ace cards in a standard deck, one in each suit. We need to consider two scenarios for the second draw: (1) the first card drawn was an ace of $\\diamondsuit$, and (2) the first card drawn was a $\\diamondsuit$ but not an ace.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of drawing an ace as the second card if the first card was the ace of $\\diamondsuit$.\nIf the first card drawn was the ace of $\\diamondsuit$, there would be 51 cards left, with 3 aces remaining. The probability of drawing an ace in this scenario is $\\frac{3}{51}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of drawing an ace as the second card if the first card was a $\\diamondsuit$ but not an ace.\nIf the first card drawn was a $\\diamondsuit$ but not an ace, there would be 51 cards left, with 4 aces remaining. The probability of drawing an ace in this scenario is $\\frac{4}{51}$.\n\n## Step 6: Combine the probabilities from the two scenarios, considering the likelihood of each scenario occurring.\nThe probability of drawing the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ first is $\\frac{1}{52}$, and the probability of drawing any other $\\diamondsuit$ first is $\\frac{12}{52}$. We then multiply these probabilities by the respective probabilities of drawing an ace in the second step and sum them up.\n\n## Step 7: Perform the calculations.\nThe probability of the first card being the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card being an ace is $\\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51}$. The probability of the first card being any other $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card being an ace is $\\frac{12}{52} \\times \\frac{4}{51}$.

  "solution": "We have two cases because if the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$, it could be an ace or not be an ace.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{3}{51} = \\dfrac{1}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the three remaining aces, which gives a probability of $\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot \\dfrac{1}{17} = \\dfrac{1}{884}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{12}{52} = \\dfrac{3}{13}$ chance that a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the ace is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{4}{51}$ chance that an ace is drawn second, giving a $\\dfrac{3}{13}\\cdot \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{4}{221}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nSo the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\\dfrac{1}{884} + \\dfrac{4}{221} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}$.\n\nNotice that we can avoid some of the large denominators above by organizing this computation as follows: $$\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{3}{51}+\\dfrac{12}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{1\\cdot 3+12\\cdot 4}{52\\cdot 51} = \\dfrac{51}{52\\cdot 51}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}.$$",
