    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the formula for combinations\nThe problem asks us to compute $\\dbinom{16}{5}$, which represents the number of ways to choose 5 items out of 16 without regard to order. The formula for combinations is $\\dbinom{n}{r} = \\dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n!$ denotes the factorial of $n$, which is the product of all positive integers up to $n$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the formula for combinations to the given problem\nWe will use the formula $\\dbinom{n}{r} = \\dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$ with $n = 16$ and $r = 5$. So, $\\dbinom{16}{5} = \\dfrac{16!}{5!(16-5)!}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the factorials and simplify the expression\nNow, let's calculate the factorials and simplify. $16! = 16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$, $5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$, and $(16-5)! = 11! = 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$. We can simplify $\\dfrac{16!}{5!(16-5)!}$ by canceling out the common factors in the numerator and denominator.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression by canceling out common factors\n$\\dfrac{16!}{5!(16-5)!} = \\dfrac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11!}{5! \\times 11!}$. The $11!$ in the numerator and denominator can be canceled out, leaving us with $\\dfrac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12}{5!}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the remaining factorials and simplify\n$5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$. So, $\\dfrac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12}{120}$.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the multiplication in the numerator\n$16 \\times 15 = 240$, $240 \\times 14 = 3360$, $3360 \\times 13 = 43680$, $43680 \\times 12 = 524160$.\n\n## Step 7: Divide the product by 120\n$\\dfrac{524160}{120} = 4368$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4368}$"
