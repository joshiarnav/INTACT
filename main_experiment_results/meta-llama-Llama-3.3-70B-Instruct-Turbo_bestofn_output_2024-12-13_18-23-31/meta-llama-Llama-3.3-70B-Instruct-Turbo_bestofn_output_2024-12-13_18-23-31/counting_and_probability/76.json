    "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to choose 6 people out of 7\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 6 people out of the 7 who arrived for dinner. This can be calculated using combinations, specifically \"7 choose 6\", which is denoted as C(7, 6) and calculated as 7! / (6! * (7-6)!).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to arrange 6 people in a circular manner\nAfter choosing 6 people, we need to arrange them around a circular table. The number of ways to arrange n distinct objects in a circular manner is (n-1)!, because rotations are considered the same. Therefore, for 6 people, the number of arrangements is (6-1)! = 5!.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the calculations for Step 1\nC(7, 6) = 7! / (6! * 1!) = 7.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the calculations for Step 2\nThe number of arrangements for 6 people around a circular table is 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of different ways to choose and seat the people\nThe total number of ways is the product of the number of ways to choose 6 people out of 7 and the number of ways to arrange them around the table. Total = C(7, 6) * 5! = 7 * 120.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the final multiplication\n7 * 120 = 840.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{840}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to choose six people out of seven.\nTo choose six people out of seven, we use the combination formula, which is given by $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of people and $k$ is the number of people we want to choose. In this case, $n = 7$ and $k = 6$, so the number of ways to choose six people out of seven is $C(7, 6) = \\frac{7!}{6!(7-6)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6!}{6! \\times 1!} = 7$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to seat six people at a circular table.\nOnce we have chosen six people, we need to seat them at a circular table. The number of ways to arrange $n$ distinct objects in a circle is $(n-1)!$, because we can fix one person and arrange the remaining $n-1$ people in $(n-1)!$ ways. In this case, $n = 6$, so the number of ways to seat six people at a circular table is $(6-1)! = 5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of different ways to choose six people and seat them at the table.\nTo find the total number of different ways to choose six people and seat them at the table, we multiply the number of ways to choose six people out of seven by the number of ways to seat six people at a circular table. This gives us $7 \\times 120 = 840$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{840}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to choose six people from seven.\nTo start solving this problem, we first need to determine the number of ways we can choose six people out of the seven to seat at the table. This is a combination problem, since the order in which we choose the people does not matter. The formula for combinations is given by $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $k$ is the number of items to choose, and $!$ denotes factorial. Here, $n = 7$ and $k = 6$, so the number of ways to choose six people from seven is $C(7, 6) = \\frac{7!}{6!(7-6)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6!}{6! \\times 1!} = 7$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to seat six people at a circular table.\nAfter choosing six people, we need to seat them at a circular table. The number of ways to arrange $n$ distinct objects in a circle is $(n-1)!$, because we can fix one person's position and arrange the rest. Here, we have six people, so the number of ways to seat them at the circular table is $(6-1)! = 5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the product rule to find the total number of different seatings.\nThe product rule states that if one event can occur in $m$ ways and a second event can occur in $n$ ways, then the events together can occur in $m \\times n$ ways. Here, we have two events: choosing six people from seven (which can be done in 7 ways) and seating them at the circular table (which can be done in 120 ways). Therefore, the total number of different ways to choose six people and seat them at the table is $7 \\times 120 = 840$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{840}$"

  "solution": "There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing.  To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person.  This suggests that there are $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people.  However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count.  Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table.  There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.",
