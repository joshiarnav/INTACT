    "## Step 1: Understand the spinner and its possible outcomes\nThe spinner has five congruent sectors, numbered from 1 to 5. Each spin of the spinner can result in one of these five numbers.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the total number of possible outcomes for Jane and her brother\nSince both Jane and her brother spin the spinner once, the total number of possible outcomes is 5 * 5 = 25.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the winning conditions for Jane\nJane wins if the non-negative difference between her number and her brother's number is less than 3. This means she will win in the following cases: (1) if the numbers are the same, (2) if the difference is 1, or (3) if the difference is 2.\n\n## Step 4: Enumerate the winning outcomes for Jane\nTo calculate the probability of Jane winning, we need to enumerate all the winning outcomes based on the conditions identified in Step 3.\n\n- For the numbers being the same, the outcomes are (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5). That's 5 outcomes.\n- For a difference of 1, the outcomes are (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,3), (4,5), (5,4). That's 8 outcomes.\n- For a difference of 2, the outcomes are (1,3), (3,1), (2,4), (4,2), (3,5), (5,3). That's 6 outcomes.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of winning outcomes for Jane\nAdding up the outcomes from Step 4: 5 (same number) + 8 (difference of 1) + 6 (difference of 2) = 19 winning outcomes.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of Jane winning\nThe probability of Jane winning is the number of winning outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability = 19 / 25.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{19}{25}}$",

  "solution": "We consider the unordered pairs, or sets, of spins for which the difference of the numbers are greater than or equal to 3, or those games which Jane loses. These can only occur in the sets $\\{1, 4\\}$, $\\{1, 5 \\}$ or $\\{ 2, 5 \\}$. Each of these unordered pairs can occur in 2 orderings (depending on whether Jane or her brother spins each number). So, there are $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ losing combinations out of $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ for Jane. So, her winning probability is $1 - \\frac{6}{25} = \\boxed{\\frac{19}{25}}$.",
