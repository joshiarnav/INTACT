  "problem": "A math conference is presenting a lecture series with six different lecturers. If Dr. Smith's lecture depends on Dr. Jones's lecture, so that Dr. Smith must be scheduled at some time after Dr. Jones, in how many orders can the six lecturers be scheduled?",

    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of lecturers\nThere are six different lecturers that need to be scheduled.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of possible orders without any restrictions\nTo find the total number of possible orders for the six lecturers without any restrictions, we use the concept of permutations. The formula for permutations of n items is n!, where \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. So, for six lecturers, the total number of possible orders is 6! = 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 720.\n\n## Step 3: Account for the restriction that Dr. Smith must be scheduled after Dr. Jones\nGiven the restriction that Dr. Smith's lecture must be scheduled after Dr. Jones's lecture, we need to consider how this affects the total number of possible orders. Exactly half of the total possible orders will have Dr. Smith scheduled after Dr. Jones, and the other half will have Dr. Smith scheduled before Dr. Jones. This is because for every schedule where Dr. Smith is after Dr. Jones, there is a corresponding schedule where their positions are swapped, violating the condition.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of valid orders\nSince half of the total possible orders will meet the condition of having Dr. Smith scheduled after Dr. Jones, we divide the total number of possible orders by 2. So, the number of valid orders is 720 / 2 = 360.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{360}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of lecturers\nThere are six different lecturers that need to be scheduled.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of possible orders without any restrictions\nTo find the total number of possible orders for the six lecturers without any restrictions, we use the factorial of the number of lecturers, since each position in the schedule can be filled by any of the remaining lecturers. This is calculated as 6! (6 factorial), which equals 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720 possible orders.\n\n## Step 3: Account for the restriction between Dr. Smith and Dr. Jones\nGiven that Dr. Smith must be scheduled after Dr. Jones, exactly half of the total possible orders will meet this criterion. This is because for every valid order where Dr. Jones lectures before Dr. Smith, there is a corresponding invalid order where their positions are swapped.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of valid orders\nSince half of the total possible orders will have Dr. Jones before Dr. Smith, we divide the total number of possible orders by 2 to find the number of valid orders.

    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of lecturers\nThere are six different lecturers scheduled to give lectures.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of possible orders without restrictions\nTo find the total number of ways to arrange the six lecturers without any restrictions, we use the factorial function. The number of ways to arrange n items is n!. So, for six lecturers, the total number of possible orders is 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the restriction imposed by Dr. Smith's and Dr. Jones's lectures\nGiven that Dr. Smith must be scheduled after Dr. Jones, exactly half of the total possible orders will meet this criterion. This is because for every valid order where Dr. Jones lectures before Dr. Smith, there is a corresponding invalid order where Dr. Smith lectures before Dr. Jones.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of valid orders\nSince half of the total possible orders are valid (where Dr. Jones lectures before Dr. Smith), we divide the total number of possible orders by 2. So, the number of valid orders is 720 / 2 = 360.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{360}$"

  "solution": "There are a total of $6!$ ways to order the 6 lectures with no restriction. By symmetry, exactly half of these will have Dr. Jones's lecture before Dr. Smith's lecture. Thus there are $6!/2 = \\boxed{360}$ ways to schedule the conference.",
