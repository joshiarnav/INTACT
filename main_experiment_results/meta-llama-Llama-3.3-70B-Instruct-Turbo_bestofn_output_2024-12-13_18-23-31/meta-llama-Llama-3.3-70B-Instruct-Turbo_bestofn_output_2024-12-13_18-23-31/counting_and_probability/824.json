    "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware out of 18\nTo find the total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware out of 18, we use the combination formula $C(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $r$ is the number of items to choose. In this case, $n = 18$ and $r = 3$. So, $C(18, 3) = \\frac{18!}{3!(18-3)!} = \\frac{18*17*16}{3*2*1} = 816$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife\nThere are 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives. The number of ways to choose one of each is $6 * 6 * 6 = 216$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of choosing one fork, one spoon, and one knife\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. So, the probability is $\\frac{216}{816}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the fraction\nSimplifying the fraction $\\frac{216}{816}$ gives $\\frac{27}{102}$, which simplifies further to $\\frac{9}{34}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{34}}$",
    "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware out of 18\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware out of 18 can be calculated using the combination formula, which is given by: $\\dbinom{n}{r} = \\dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$. In this case, $n = 18$ (total number of pieces) and $r = 3$ (number of pieces to choose). So, $\\dbinom{18}{3} = \\dfrac{18!}{3!(18-3)!} = \\dfrac{18*17*16}{3*2*1} = 816$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 1 fork, 1 spoon, and 1 knife\nThere are 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives. The number of ways to choose 1 fork out of 6 is $\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6$. Similarly, the number of ways to choose 1 spoon out of 6 is $\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6$, and the number of ways to choose 1 knife out of 6 is $\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6$. Since these choices are independent, the total number of ways to choose 1 fork, 1 spoon, and 1 knife is $6 * 6 * 6 = 216$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of choosing 1 fork, 1 spoon, and 1 knife\nThe probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. The number of favorable outcomes (choosing 1 fork, 1 spoon, and 1 knife) is 216, and the total number of possible outcomes (choosing any 3 pieces of silverware) is 816. So, the probability is $\\dfrac{216}{816} = \\dfrac{27}{102}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the probability fraction\nThe fraction $\\dfrac{27}{102}$ can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. So, $\\dfrac{27}{102} = \\dfrac{9}{34}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{34}}$",

  "solution": "First, we can find the denominator of our fraction.  There are a total of $\\dbinom{18}{3}=816$ ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware out of 18.  To find the numerator, we need to count the number of ways to choose one piece of each type of silverware.  There are 6 ways we could choose a fork, 6 ways to choose a spoon, and 6 ways to choose a knife, making a total of $6\\cdot 6 \\cdot 6=216$ ways to choose a fork, a knife, and a spoon so our final probability is $\\frac{216}{816}=\\boxed{\\frac{9}{34}}$.",
