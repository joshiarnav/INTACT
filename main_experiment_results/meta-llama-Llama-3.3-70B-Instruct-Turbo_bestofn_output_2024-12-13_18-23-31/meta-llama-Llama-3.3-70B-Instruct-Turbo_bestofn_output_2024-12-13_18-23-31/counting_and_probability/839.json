    "## Step 1: Define the problem and understand the constraints\nWe are tasked with finding the number of seven-letter \"good words\" that can be formed using the letters A, B, and C. A good word is defined as a sequence where A is never immediately followed by B, B is never immediately followed by C, and C is never immediately followed by A.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of choices for the first letter\nFor the first letter of the sequence, we have 3 choices: A, B, or C, since there are no restrictions on the first letter.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of choices for the subsequent letters\nAfter choosing the first letter, for each subsequent letter, we have 2 choices because once we've chosen a letter, there is only one letter that cannot follow it according to the rules. For example, if we start with A, we can follow it with either A or C, but not B. This pattern holds for any letter we choose, resulting in 2 choices for each subsequent letter.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of good words\nTo find the total number of seven-letter good words, we multiply the number of choices for each letter together. Since we have 3 choices for the first letter and 2 choices for each of the 6 subsequent letters, the calculation is 3 * 2^6.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the calculation\n3 * 2^6 = 3 * 64 = 192.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{192}$",
    "## Step 1: Define the possible letters and their restrictions\nWe are given that a \"good word\" consists only of the letters $A$, $B$, and $C$, with the restrictions that $A$ cannot be immediately followed by $B$, $B$ cannot be immediately followed by $C$, and $C$ cannot be immediately followed by $A$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of possibilities for the first letter\nFor the first letter of the sequence, we have 3 possibilities: $A$, $B$, or $C$, since there are no restrictions on the first letter.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of possibilities for the subsequent letters\nAfter the first letter, each subsequent letter has 2 possibilities. This is because once a letter is chosen, there is only one letter that cannot immediately follow it, leaving 2 options out of the 3 letters.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of good words\nTo find the total number of seven-letter good words, we multiply the number of possibilities for each letter together. For the first letter, we have 3 possibilities. For each of the subsequent 6 letters, we have 2 possibilities due to the restrictions. Therefore, the total number of good words is $3 \\times 2^6$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $3 \\times 2^6$\n$3 \\times 2^6 = 3 \\times 64 = 192$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{192}$",
    "## Step 1: Define the problem and the constraints for a \"good word\".\nA good word consists only of the letters $A$, $B$, and $C$, and none of these letters can immediately follow another in a specific order: $A$ cannot be followed by $B$, $B$ cannot be followed by $C$, and $C$ cannot be followed by $A$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of choices for the first letter of the good word.\nSince the first letter can be any of $A$, $B$, or $C$ without restriction, there are 3 choices for the first letter.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of choices for each subsequent letter in the good word.\nFor each subsequent letter, given the constraints, there are only 2 choices. For example, if the first letter is $A$, the second letter can be either $A$ or $C$ because $B$ cannot follow $A$. This pattern holds for any letter: once a letter is chosen, there are only 2 options for the next letter due to the restrictions.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of seven-letter good words.\nTo find the total number of seven-letter good words, we multiply the number of choices for each letter position. For the first letter, there are 3 choices. For each of the subsequent 6 letters, there are 2 choices due to the constraints. So, the calculation is $3 \\times 2^6$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the calculation.\n$3 \\times 2^6 = 3 \\times 64 = 192$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{192}$"
