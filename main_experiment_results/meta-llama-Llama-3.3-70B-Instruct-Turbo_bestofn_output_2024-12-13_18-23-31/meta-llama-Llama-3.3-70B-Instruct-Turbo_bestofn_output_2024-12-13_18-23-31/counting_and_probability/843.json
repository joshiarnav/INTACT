  "problem": "A bag contains 3 tan, 2 pink and 4 violet chips. If the 9 chips are randomly drawn from the bag, one at a time and without replacement, what is the probability that the chips are drawn in such a way that the 3 tan chips are drawn consecutively, the 2 pink chips are drawn consecutively, and the 4 violet chips are drawn consecutively, but not necessarily in the tan-pink-violet order?

    "## Step 1: Count the total number of possible chip orders.\nThere are 9 chips in the bag, so there are $9!$ possible orders in which the chips can be drawn.\n\n## Step 2: Count the number of possible orders where the tan, pink, and violet chips are drawn consecutively.\nWe can treat each group of consecutive chips as a single unit. There are 3 groups (tan, pink, violet), so there are $3!$ possible orders for these groups. Within each group, the chips can be ordered in $3!$ (tan), $2!$ (pink), and $4!$ (violet) ways, respectively.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of possible orders where the tan, pink, and violet chips are drawn consecutively.\nThe total number of possible orders is $3! \\times 3! \\times 2! \\times 4!$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that the chips are drawn in such a way that the 3 tan chips are drawn consecutively, the 2 pink chips are drawn consecutively, and the 4 violet chips are drawn consecutively.\nThe probability is $\\frac{3! \\times 3! \\times 2! \\times 4!}{9!}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression.\n$\\frac{3! \\times 3! \\times 2! \\times 4!}{9!} = \\frac{6 \\times 6 \\times 2 \\times 24}{362,880} = \\frac{1728}{362,880} = \\frac{1}{210}$.\n\nThe final answer is:$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{210}}$",

  "solution": "We count the number of ways to draw the tan chips consecutively, the pink chips consecutively, and the violet chips consecutively (although not necessarily in that order).  First of all, we can draw the tan chips in $3!$ ways, the pink chips in $2!$ ways, and the violet chips in $4!$ ways.  We can choose our drawing order (e.g pink-tan-violet) in $3!$ ways.  Thus we have $3!2!4!3!$ satisfying arrangements and $9!$ total ways of drawing the chips.  So our answer is $\\frac{3!2!4!3!}{9!} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{210}}$.",
