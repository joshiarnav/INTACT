    "## Step 1:  First, let's analyze the tessellation pattern given in the problem.\nThe tessellation consists of hexagonal tiles arranged in a honeycomb-like pattern. Each tile shares sides with six neighboring tiles.\n\n## Step 2:  To determine the least number of colors needed, we need to consider the constraints of the problem: no two tiles sharing a side can be the same color.\nGiven the hexagonal arrangement, if we color one tile, the six tiles surrounding it must be colored differently.\n\n## Step 3:  Let's consider the minimum number of colors required to meet this condition.\nSince each tile is surrounded by six others, we might initially think that six different colors would be needed. However, this is not the case, as we can alternate colors in a pattern that allows fewer colors to be used.\n\n## Step 4:  Looking at the pattern, we can observe that it resembles a chessboard or a checkerboard, where each tile is surrounded by tiles of the opposite color.\nIn a checkerboard pattern, only two colors are needed to ensure that no two adjacent tiles (or squares, in the case of a checkerboard) have the same color.\n\n## Step 5:  Applying this to our tessellation, if we color the tiles in an alternating pattern, similar to a checkerboard, we can achieve the condition of no two tiles sharing a side being the same color using just two colors.\nFor example, we could color the tiles in a sequence of color A, color B, color A, color B, and so on, ensuring that each tile is surrounded by tiles of the opposite color.\n\n## Step 6:  Therefore, based on this analysis, the least number of colors needed to shade the tessellation such that no two tiles sharing a side are the same color is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

    "## Step 1:  The problem presents a tessellation pattern, and we are tasked with determining the minimum number of colors required to shade the tiles such that no two adjacent tiles share the same color.\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, let's start by examining the pattern and identifying any repeating structures or symmetries that could help us find a solution.\n## Step 3:  Looking at the tessellation, we can see that each tile is a hexagon with a specific arrangement of neighboring tiles. This pattern resembles a honeycomb or a hexagonal grid, which is often associated with efficient packing and tessellations.\n## Step 4:  A common strategy for coloring such patterns is to use a small set of colors and apply them in a repeating manner to ensure that adjacent tiles do not share the same color.\n## Step 5:  In this case, we can observe that the tessellation has a repeating pattern of hexagons, where each hexagon is surrounded by six neighboring hexagons.\n## Step 6:  We can color the central hexagon with one color, and then alternately color the surrounding hexagons with a second color. This strategy ensures that no two adjacent hexagons have the same color.\n## Step 7:  By applying this coloring scheme, we can see that only two colors are needed to shade the entire tessellation without any adjacent tiles sharing the same color.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the minimum number of colors required to shade the tessellation such that no two tiles sharing a side are the same color is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"

  "solution": "Clearly one color isn't enough; $\\boxed{2}$ colors will work because the tessellation shown is topologically identical to a chessboard (that is, imagine straightening out the diagonal lines to form an array of squares. This process doesn't change which tiles share a side.).",
