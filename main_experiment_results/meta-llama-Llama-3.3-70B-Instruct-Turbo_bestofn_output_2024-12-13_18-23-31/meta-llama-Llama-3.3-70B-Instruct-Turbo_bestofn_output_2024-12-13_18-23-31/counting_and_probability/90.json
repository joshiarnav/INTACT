    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling 5 standard 6-sided dice.\nWhen rolling 5 dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the total number of outcomes for all 5 dice is $6^5 = 7776$.\n\n## Step 2: Understand what a composite number is.\nA composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. Conversely, a number is considered to be composite if it is not prime. For the product of the dice to be composite, we need to consider the cases where the product is not a prime number.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the cases where the product of the dice is not composite.\nThe product will not be composite if at least four dice show a 1, and the fifth die shows either a 1, 2, 3, or 5. If all the dice show a 1, there is exactly one way this can happen. For each of the other three cases (where four dice show a 1 and the last die shows a 2, 3, or 5), there are 5 ways since the non-1 die can appear in any of the 5 positions.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to achieve a non-composite product.\n- All 1s: 1 way\n- Four 1s and a 2: 5 ways\n- Four 1s and a 3: 5 ways\n- Four 1s and a 5: 5 ways\nThis totals to $1 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 16$ ways to get a non-composite product.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that the product is composite.\nThe probability that the product is composite is 1 minus the probability that the product is not composite. The probability of getting a non-composite product is the number of ways to get a non-composite product divided by the total number of outcomes. Therefore, the probability of a composite product is $1 - \\frac{16}{7776}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the probability calculation.\n$1 - \\frac{16}{7776} = \\frac{7776 - 16}{7776} = \\frac{7760}{7776}$.\n\n## Step 7: Further simplify the fraction if possible.\nThe fraction $\\frac{7760}{7776}$ can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 16. Thus, $\\frac{7760 \\div 16}{7776 \\div 16} = \\frac{485}{486}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{485}{486}}$",

  "solution": "While it is almost tempting to make this into the casework problem to end all casework problems, using complementary probability makes the problem a lot simpler, so we will find the probability that the product is not composite.\n\nIt's clear that if more than one die shows a roll greater than 1, the resulting product will have more than one factor that is greater than 1 and therefore be composite. Additionally, if any of the dice show a 4 or a 6, the product will obviously be composite. So in order for the product to not be composite, we need at least four dice to be a 1 and the fifth die to either be another 1 or a 2, a 3, or a 5.\n\nThere's exactly one way in which all the the dice can be 1's, and for each of the other three cases there are 5 ways since the die that isn't a 1 can appear in any of the 5 other positions, so there are a total of $3\\cdot5+1=16$ ways of rolling the dice that result in a product that isn't composite. Additionally, there are 6 options for the roll of each of the 5 dice for a total of $6^5=7776$ possible outcomes, which means that the probability of the product not being composite is $\\dfrac{16}{7776}$ and the probability that it is composite is $1-\\frac{16}{7776}=\\frac{7760}{7776}=\\boxed{\\frac{485}{486}}$.\n\nNote: Many students have tried to argue that 1 is not a prime number and should not be counted. As we are doing complementary probability, it is important to consider all numbers that are not composite, and 1 is definitely not composite.",
