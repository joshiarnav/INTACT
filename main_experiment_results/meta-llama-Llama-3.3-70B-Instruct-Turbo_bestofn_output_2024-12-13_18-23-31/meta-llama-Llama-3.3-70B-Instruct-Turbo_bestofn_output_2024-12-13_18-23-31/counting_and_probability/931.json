    "## Step 1: Determine the possible outcomes for two 6-sided dice\nWhen two fair 6-sided dice are tossed, each die has 6 possible outcomes. Since we are tossing two dice, the total number of outcomes is 6 * 6 = 36.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the numbers on a 6-sided die that are divisible by 3\nThe numbers on a 6-sided die that are divisible by 3 are 3 and 6.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the possible combinations of $a$ and $b$ that are divisible by 3\nFor $ab$ to be divisible by 3, both $a$ and $b$ must be divisible by 3. The possible combinations for $a$ and $b$ are (3,3), (3,6), (6,3), and (6,6).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of $ab$ being divisible by 3\nThere are 4 favorable outcomes: (3,3), (3,6), (6,3), and (6,6). The total number of possible outcomes is 36. The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability\nThe probability = number of favorable outcomes / total number of outcomes = 4 / 36 = 1 / 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the total possible outcomes when two 6-sided dice are tossed.\nWhen two 6-sided dice are tossed, each die can land on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since there are 6 possible outcomes for each die, the total number of outcomes for two dice is 6 * 6 = 36.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the favorable outcomes where both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 3.\nFor $a$ and $b$ to be divisible by 3, they must be one of the following numbers: 3 or 6, since these are the only numbers between 1 and 6 that are divisible by 3. Thus, the pairs $(a, b)$ that satisfy this condition are (3,3), (3,6), (6,3), and (6,6).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of getting a two-digit number $ab$ where both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 3.\nThere are 4 favorable outcomes as identified in Step 2. The total possible outcomes were determined in Step 1 as 36. Therefore, the probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 4 / 36.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the probability fraction if necessary.\nThe fraction 4 / 36 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4. Simplifying gives 1 / 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the total possible outcomes when two dice are tossed.\nWhen two dice are tossed, each die has 6 possible outcomes. Since we have two dice, the total possible outcomes are 6 * 6 = 36.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the conditions for $ab$, $a$, and $b$ to be divisible by 3.\nFor $ab$ to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits $a + b$ must be divisible by 3. Additionally, both $a$ and $b$ must individually be divisible by 3.\n\n## Step 3: List the possible values of $a$ and $b$ that are divisible by 3.\nGiven that $a$ and $b$ are the results of a dice toss, the possible values for both $a$ and $b$ that are divisible by 3 are 3 and 6.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the combinations of $a$ and $b$ where both are divisible by 3 and the two-digit number $ab$ is also divisible by 3.\nThe combinations where both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 3 are (3,3), (3,6), (6,3), and (6,6). We need to check which of these combinations also make $ab$ divisible by 3.\n\n## Step 5: Check each combination to see if the two-digit number $ab$ is divisible by 3.\n- For (3,3), $ab = 33$, and $3 + 3 = 6$, which is divisible by 3.\n- For (3,6), $ab = 36$, and $3 + 6 = 9$, which is divisible by 3.\n- For (6,3), $ab = 63$, and $6 + 3 = 9$, which is divisible by 3.\n- For (6,6), $ab = 66$, and $6 + 6 = 12$, which is divisible by 3.\nSo, all combinations satisfy the condition.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability.\nThere are 4 successful outcomes where $a$, $b$, and $ab$ are all divisible by 3. The total possible outcomes are 36. Thus, the probability is 4/36 = 1/9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$"

  "solution": "$ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) is divisible by 3 only when $a+b$ is divisible by 3. Since 3 divides both $a$ and $a+b$, 3 must divide $b$. Therefore, $a$ and $b$ can equal 3 or 6. The probability that $a$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. The probability that $b$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. Therefore, The probability that both $a$ and $b$ equal 3 or 6 is $\\left(\\frac13\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac19}$.",
