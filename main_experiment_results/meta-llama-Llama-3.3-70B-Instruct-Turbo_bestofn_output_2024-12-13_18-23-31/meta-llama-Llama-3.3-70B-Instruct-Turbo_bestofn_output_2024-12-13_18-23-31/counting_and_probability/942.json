    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find how many different positive integers can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 14, 15, 16 \\}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the range of possible differences\nThe largest difference will be obtained by subtracting the smallest number from the largest number in the set, which is $16 - 1 = 15$. The smallest difference will be obtained by subtracting two consecutive numbers, which is $2 - 1 = 1$.\n\n## Step 3: Consider all possible differences\nAny positive integer from 1 to 15 can be obtained as a difference of two distinct members of the set. For example, 1 can be obtained as $2 - 1$, 2 can be obtained as $3 - 1$, and so on up to 15 which can be obtained as $16 - 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Count the number of different positive integers\nSince we can obtain any positive integer from 1 to 15 as a difference of two distinct members of the set, the total number of different positive integers is 15.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the set given.\nThe problem asks us to find how many different positive integers can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 14, 15, 16 \\}$. This means we need to consider all possible pairs of distinct numbers from this set and calculate their differences.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the range of possible differences.\nThe smallest possible difference is $2 - 1 = 1$, and the largest possible difference is $16 - 1 = 15$. This gives us a range of differences from 1 to 15.\n\n## Step 3: Consider if all integers within this range can! be formed.\nSince we can get a difference of 1 (from 2-1), 2 (from 3-1), 3 (from 4-1), and so on up to 15 (from 16-1), it suggests that all integers from 1 to 15 can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the given set.\n\n## Step 4: Confirm that no other differences are possible outside this range.\nGiven the set only goes up to 16, the maximum difference we can achieve is 15 (by subtracting 1 from 16). Similarly, the minimum difference is 1 (by subtracting 1 from 2). Thus, we cannot achieve differences greater than 15 or less than 1 with the given set.\n\n## Step 5: Count the total number of different positive integers that can be represented.\nSince all integers from 1 to 15 can be represented, the total count is 15.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the set given\nThe set given is a sequence of consecutive integers from 1 to 16.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the differences that can be achieved\nTo find the different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set, we should start by looking at the smallest and largest possible differences. The smallest difference will be 1 (between consecutive numbers), and the largest difference will be 15 (between 1 and 16).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the range of possible differences\nSince the set is consecutive and includes all integers from 1 to 16, any positive integer from 1 up to 15 can be formed by subtracting two appropriate numbers from the set. For example, to get a difference of 1, we can subtract 2 from 3 (3-2=1), and to get a difference of 15, we can subtract 1 from 16 (16-1=15).\n\n## Step 4: Enumerate the possible differences\nBy considering all possible pairs of distinct numbers from the set, we can see that we can achieve differences from 1 up to 15. For instance:\n- A difference of 1 can be achieved with (2-1), (3-2), ..., (16-15).\n- A difference of 2 can be achieved with (3-1), (4-2), ..., (16-14).\n- This pattern continues until the difference of 15, which can be achieved with (16-1).\n\n## Step 5: Count the number of different positive integers\nGiven the sequence and the ability to form any difference from 1 to 15, we count how many distinct positive integers can be represented. Since we can achieve every difference from 1 through 15, there are 15 different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
