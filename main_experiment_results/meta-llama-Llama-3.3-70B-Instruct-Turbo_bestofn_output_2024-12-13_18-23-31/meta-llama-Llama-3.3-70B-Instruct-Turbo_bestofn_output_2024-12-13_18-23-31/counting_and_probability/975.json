    "## Step 1: The problem presents a figure with interconnected hexagons, where each hexagon must be colored red, yellow, or green, and no two hexagons with a common side can have the same color.\nThe figure has a specific hexagon colored red, and we need to determine the number of different ways the entire figure can be colored while adhering to the given conditions.\n\n## Step 2: To approach this problem, we can start by examining the hexagons adjacent to the given red hexagon.\nSince these hexagons share a side with the red hexagon, they cannot be colored red. This means they can only be colored yellow or green.\n\n## Step 3: Let's consider the possible color combinations for the hexagons adjacent to the red hexagon.\nThere are two possibilities: either the two adjacent hexagons are both yellow, or one is yellow and the other is green.\n\n## Step 4: If the two adjacent hexagons are both yellow, then the next hexagon in line (to the right of the red hexagon) must be green.\nThis is because no two hexagons with a common side can have the same color, so the next hexagon cannot be yellow.\n\n## Step 5: Continuing this pattern of color assignment, we can determine the color of each hexagon in the figure.\nBy analyzing the constraints imposed by the already colored hexagons, we can systematically determine the possible color combinations for the entire figure.\n\n## Step 6: Upon careful examination, it becomes evident that there are only two possible ways to color the figure while satisfying the given conditions.\nThese two possibilities arise from the initial choice of colors for the hexagons adjacent to the red hexagon.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
    "## Step 1:  First, we need to understand the constraints of coloring the hexagons. Each hexagon must be colored red, yellow, or green, and no two hexagons that share a side can have the same color.\n## Step 2:  We're given that the hexagon with the letter \"R\" is colored red. This gives us a starting point to work from.\n## Step 3:  Looking at the hexagons adjacent to the red one, we can determine that they must be colored either yellow or green, as they share a side with the red hexagon.\n## Step 4:  Let's consider the possible color combinations for the two hexagons adjacent to the red one. There are two cases: (1) the top hexagon is yellow and the bottom hexagon is green, or (2) the top hexagon is green and the bottom hexagon is yellow.\n## Step 5:  After determining the colors of the adjacent hexagons, we need to consider the constraints imposed on the rest of the figure. The colors of the remaining hexagons will be forced by the colors chosen for the adjacent hexagons.\n## Step 6:  For each of the two cases, we can continue to apply the coloring constraints to the remaining hexagons, ensuring that no two hexagons with a common side have the same color.\n## Step 7:  By considering these constraints and applying them to the entire figure, we can determine the total number of different ways the figure can be colored.\n## Step 8:  It's important to ensure that we account for all possible combinations while adhering to the given constraints.\n## Step 9:  After thorough analysis, we can conclude that there are only two possible ways to color the figure, as the coloring of the adjacent hexagons forces the colors of the remaining hexagons.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the total number of different ways the figure can be colored is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
    "## Step 1: Understanding the constraints of the problem\nThe hexagon with the letter R is already colored red. Each hexagon must be colored red, yellow, or green, and no two hexagons with a common side can have the same color.\n\n## Step 2: Determining the color of the adjacent hexagons\nSince the hexagon with R is colored red, the two hexagons adjacent to it (one above and one below) cannot be red. They must be either yellow or green. The choice of color for these two hexagons will determine the coloring of the rest of the figure.\n\n## Step 3: Considering the possibilities for the adjacent hexagons\nThere are two possibilities for the colors of the two hexagons adjacent to the red hexagon: (1) one is yellow and the other is green, or (2) both are the same color, which is not allowed by the problem statement. Thus, the only viable option is that one is yellow and the other is green.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing the impact of the color choice on the rest of the figure\nOnce the colors of the two adjacent hexagons are decided (one yellow and one green), the rest of the figure's coloring falls into place. The hexagons that share a side with the yellow one cannot be yellow, and similarly, the hexagons that share a side with the green one cannot be green. This creates a pattern where the colors alternate.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the number of possible colorings\nGiven that the first choice (the color of the hexagon adjacent to the red one) determines the rest of the coloring due to the constraints, we need to consider how many different ways this initial choice can be made. There are two possible colors for the first hexagon (yellow or green), and once that is chosen, the coloring of the rest of the figure is determined by the rules.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"

  "solution": "The hexagons in the second column to the left must be yellow and green, but either color can be on top: 2 possibilities. With either possibility, the rest of the figure is easily colored in, with the color of every other hexagon being forced.  (ex. In the third column, the middle hexagon must be red, and the top and bottom must be the opposite of the top and bottom in the second column)  Thus, there are only $\\boxed{2}$ possibilities.",
