    "## Step 1: Understand the given information\nWe are given a trapezoid $ABCD$ where $AB$ is parallel to $CD$, and the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$. The area of triangle $ABE$ is given as 50 square units, and the area of triangle $ADE$ is given as 20 square units.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize the relationship between the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$\nThe ratio of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ is $\\frac{50}{20} = \\frac{5}{2}$. This ratio also applies to the lengths of $AB$ and $AD$ because they share the same height from $E$.\n\n## Step 3: Establish the relationship between the areas of triangles $CDE$ and $ECB$\nSince $AB$ is parallel to $CD$, the ratio of the areas of triangles $CDE$ and $ECB$ will also be $\\frac{5}{2}$, as the triangles share the same height from $E$ but have bases ($CD$ and $CB$) that are in the same ratio as $AB$ and $AD$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of triangle $CDE$\nGiven that the area of triangle $ADE$ is 20 square units, and knowing the ratio of areas between $ABE$ and $ADE$, we can infer the area of triangle $CDE$ using the ratio $\\frac{5}{2}$ between corresponding sides and thus areas of triangles $CDE$ and $ECB$. However, to find $CDE$'s area directly from given information, we recognize that triangles $ADE$ and $CDE$ share a base and have the same height, so their areas are related to the total length of $AD$ and $CD$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the total area of the trapezoid $ABCD$\nTo find the area of trapezoid $ABCD$, we can sum the areas of triangles $ABE$, $ADE$, $CDE$, and $ECB$. Alternatively, recognizing that triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ together form triangle $ABD$ and that $ECB$ and $CDE$ together would form triangle $BCD$, we can use the relationship between these areas to find the total area.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the area of triangle $ABD$\nThe area of triangle $ABD$ is the sum of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$, which is $50 + 20 = 70$ square units.\n\n## Step 7: Use the ratio to find the area of triangle $BCD$\nGiven the ratio $\\frac{5}{2}$ between corresponding segments and thus between the areas of $ABE$ and $ADE$, and knowing that this ratio applies throughout, we can infer that the ratio of the areas of $ABD$ to $BCD$ will also be $\\frac{5}{2}$. Since $ABD$'s area is 70, we can set up a proportion or directly calculate $BCD$'s area using the ratio.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for the area of $BCD$\nThe area of $BCD$ can be found by using the ratio $\\frac{5}{2}$ between $ABD$ and $BCD$. So, $BCD = \\frac{2}{5} \\times ABD = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 70 = 28$ square units.\n\n## Step 9: Find the total area of trapezoid $ABCD$\nThe total area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is the sum of the areas of triangles $ABD$ and $BCD$. Thus, $70 + 28 = 98$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{98}$",

The area of triangle $ABE$ is given as 50 square units, and the area of triangle $ADE$ is given as 20 square units.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize the relationship between the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$\nSince $AB$ is parallel to $CD$, the height of both triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ is the same because they share the same base $AD$. This means the ratio of their areas is directly proportional to the ratio of their bases.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the bases of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$\nLet's denote the length of $AB$ as $AB = x$ and the length of $AD$ as $AD = y$. However, for the ratio of areas, we actually need to compare segments $AE$ and $DE$ since these are the bases of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ respectively, in relation to their common height. The ratio of the areas of $ABE$ to $ADE$ is $50:20$ or $5:2$. This ratio also applies to the segments $AE$ and $DE$ because the triangles share the same height from $E$ perpendicular to $AD$.\n\n## Step 4: Establish the relationship between $AE$ and $DE$ with the areas\nGiven that the ratio of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ is $5:2$, and knowing that the area of a triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$, the ratio of $AE$ to $DE$ will also be $5:2$ because the heights cancel out.\n\n## Step 5: Relate the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ to the entire trapezoid $ABCD$\nThe total area of trapezoid $ABCD$ can be found by adding the areas of triangles $ABE$, $ADE$, $BCE$, and $CDE$. However, noticing that triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ together form triangle $ABC$ and that $BCE$ and $CDE$ together would form triangle $BCD$, we can also approach this by considering the relationship between the areas of triangles $ABC$ and $BCD$.\n\n## Step 6: Use the ratio of $AE$ to $DE$ to find the ratio of $AB$ to $CD$\nGiven that $AE:DE = 5:2$, and considering the parallel lines $AB$ and $CD$, the ratio of $AB$ to $CD$ will also be $5:2$ because the diagonals divide the trapezoid into triangles that have proportional sides.\n\n## Step 7: Find the area of triangle $ABC$\nThe area of triangle $ABC$ is the sum of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$, which is $50 + 20 = 70$ square units.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the area of triangle $BCD$\nSince the ratio of $AB$ to $CD$ is $5:2$, and knowing the area of triangle $ABC$ is 70 square units, we can find the area of triangle $BCD$. The ratio of the areas of triangles $ABC$ to $BCD$ will be the same as the ratio of their bases $AB$ to $CD$, which is $5:2$. Let the area of triangle $BCD$ be $x$. We have $\\frac{70}{x} = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for the area of triangle $BCD$\nRearranging the equation $\\frac{70}{x} = \\frac{5}{2}$ gives us $x = \\frac{70 \\times 2}{5} = 28$ square units.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the total area of trapezoid $ABCD$\nThe total area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is the sum of the areas of triangles $ABC$ and $BCD$, which is $70 + 28 = 98$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{98}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nWe have a trapezoid $ABCD$ where $AB$ is parallel to $CD$, and the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$. The area of triangle $ABE$ is given as 50 square units, and the area of triangle $ADE$ is given as 20 square units. We are asked to find the area of the trapezoid $ABCD$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the properties of trapezoids and triangles\nSince $AB$ is parallel to $CD$, the triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ share a common height, which is the perpendicular distance from $E$ to $AB$. Also, the ratio of the areas of two triangles with a common height is equal to the ratio of their bases.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the ratio of the bases of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$\nLet's denote the length of $AB$ as $a$ and the length of $CD$ as $b$. Since the area of triangle $ABE$ is 50 square units and the area of triangle $ADE$ is 20 square units, the ratio of their areas is $50:20 = 5:2$. This ratio also applies to the lengths of $AE$ and $DE$ because they share the same height.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the length of $CD$ in terms of $AB$\nGiven that the ratio of $AE$ to $DE$ is $5:2$, and $AE + DE = AC$, we can establish a proportion between the lengths of the segments of the diagonals. However, to find the area of the trapezoid, we need to consider the ratio of the bases $AB$ and $CD$. Since triangles $ABC$ and $ ADC$ share a common height (the height of the trapezoid), the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of their bases. The area of triangle $ABE$ is 50, and the area of triangle $ADE$ is 20, which implies the ratio of $AB$ to $CD$ is related to the ratio of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the area of trapezoid $ABCD$\nThe area of a trapezoid can be calculated using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(a + b)h$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the parallel sides, and $h$ is the height (the perpendicular distance between the parallel sides). However, we don't have the height directly, but we can use the given areas to find the ratio of the bases and then apply it to find the total area.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the concept of similar triangles\nTriangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ are similar because they share the same angle at $A$ and have parallel sides due to the trapezoid's properties. The ratio of their areas (50:20) simplifies to 5:2, which also represents the ratio of $AB$ to $CD$ indirectly through the proportions of the triangles' sides.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the area of the entire trapezoid\nSince the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ are given, and we know that the ratio of the areas of $ABE$ to $ADE$ is 5:2, we can infer that the area of triangle $CDE$ will be in the same proportion to $ADE$ as $ABE$ is to $ADE$ because $AB$ is parallel to $CD$. This means the area of triangle $CDE$ will be proportional to $ADE$ in a 5:2 ratio, implying the area of $CDE$ is 20 * (7/5) = 28 square units, given the total ratio parts for $ABE$ and $ADE$ is 7 parts (5 parts for $ABE$ and 2 parts for $ADE$), and $CDE$ would correspond to the remaining parts to maintain the proportionality with the entire length $AC$. However, the direct calculation from given data leads us to recognize that triangles $ABE$ and $ADC$ share a base and have the same height (since $AB$ is parallel to $CD$), meaning the total area of the trapezoid can be approached by considering the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ as parts of the whole.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total area directly\nThe area of triangle $ABC$ is the sum of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$, which is 50 + 20 = 70 square units. The ratio of $AB$ to $CD$ can be inferred from the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$, which is 5:2. This implies that the area of triangle $ADC$ would be in the same proportion larger than $ABC$ as $CD$ is larger than $AB$. Since $ABE$ and $ADE$ together form $ABC$ and their ratio to the corresponding part of $ADC$ is known, we use the fact that $ABCD$'s area is the sum of $ABC$'s and $ADC$'s areas. Knowing $ABC$'s area and the proportion between $AB$ and $CD$, we deduce $ADC$'s area must be such that when added to $ABC$'s area, it respects the 5:2 ratio in terms of base lengths, thus implying a total area that encompasses both triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$ proportionally.\n\n## Step 9: Apply the ratio to find the area of $ADC$\nGiven the total area of $ABC$ is 70 square units, and knowing the ratio of the bases $AB$ to $CD$ is 5:2 (from the areas of $ABE$ and $ADE$), we recognize the areas of $ABC$ and $ADC$ must be in a similar ratio because they share the same height. Thus, if $ABC$'s area is 70, representing the 5 parts, $ADC$'s area would represent the 7 parts (since 5 parts correspond to $ABC$ and 2 parts to $ADE$, implying the total length $AC$ is divided into 7 parts). This means $ADC$'s area is (7/5)*70 = 98 square units.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the total area of the trapezoid\nThe total area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is the sum of the areas of triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$. Since we've determined the area of $ABC$ to be 70 square units and the area of $ADC$ to be 98 square units (maintaining the proportion derived from the given areas and the properties of similar triangles), the total area of the trapezoid $ABCD$ is 70 + 98 = 168 square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{98}$"
