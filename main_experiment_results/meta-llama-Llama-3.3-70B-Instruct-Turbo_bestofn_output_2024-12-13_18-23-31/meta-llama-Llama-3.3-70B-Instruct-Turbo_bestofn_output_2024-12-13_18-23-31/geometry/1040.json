    "## Step 1: Recall the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle\nThe area \\(A\\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s\\) is given by \\(A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\\).\n\n## Step 2: Set up the equation based on the given information\nWe are told that the area of the triangle is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides. So, we can set up the equation as \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = s\\).\n\n## Step 3: Solve the equation for \\(s\\)\nTo find \\(s\\), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get rid of the fraction: \\(\\sqrt{3} s^2 = 4s\\). Then, we can rearrange the equation to set it to 0: \\(\\sqrt{3} s^2 - 4s = 0\\). Factoring out an \\(s\\), we get \\(s(\\sqrt{3} s - 4) = 0\\). This gives us two possible solutions for \\(s\\): \\(s = 0\\) or \\(\\sqrt{3} s - 4 = 0\\). Since \\(s = 0\\) does not make sense for the side of a triangle, we solve \\(\\sqrt{3} s - 4 = 0\\) for \\(s\\). Adding 4 to both sides and then dividing by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), we get \\(s = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}\\).\n\n## Step 4: Rationalize the denominator of \\(s\\) if necessary\nTo rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\): \\(s = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the perimeter of the equilateral triangle\nThe perimeter \\(P\\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s\\) is \\(P = 3s\\). Substituting \\(s = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\) into the formula gives \\(P = 3 \\times \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} = 4\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$",
