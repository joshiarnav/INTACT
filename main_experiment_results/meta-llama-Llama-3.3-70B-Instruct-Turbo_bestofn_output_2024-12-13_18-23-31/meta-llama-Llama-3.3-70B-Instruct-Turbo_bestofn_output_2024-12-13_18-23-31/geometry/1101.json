    "## Step 1: Identify the coordinates of the original and image points\nThe original points are $A(2,3),$ $B(7,8),$ and $C(-4,6)$, and their respective image points after reflection about line $L$ are $A'(2,-5),$ $B'(7,-10),$ and $C'(-4,-8)$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the midpoint between each original point and its image\nTo find the equation of line $L$, we need to calculate the midpoint of the line segment connecting each original point to its image. The midpoint formula is $\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)$. Applying this formula to the points $A$ and $A'$ gives $\\left(\\frac{2 + 2}{2}, \\frac{3 - 5}{2}\\right) = (2, -1)$.\n\n## Step 3: Verify the midpoint for other pairs of points\nFor $B$ and $B'$, the midpoint is $\\left(\\frac{7 + 7}{2}, \\frac{8 - 10}{2}\\right) = (7, -1)$. For $C$ and $C'$, the midpoint is $\\left(\\frac{-4 - 4}{2}, \\frac{6 - 8}{2}\\right) = (-4, -1)$.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the pattern and determine the equation of line $L$\nAll midpoints have a $y$-coordinate of $-1$, indicating that line $L$ is horizontal and passes through $y = -1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{y = -1}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the type of transformation\nThe given transformation is a reflection. In a reflection, each point of the original figure is mapped to a new point that is the same distance from the line of reflection but on the opposite side.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the line of reflection\nTo find the equation of the line of reflection, we need to find the midpoint between each original point and its image. The line of reflection will pass through these midpoints.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the midpoint between A and A'\nThe coordinates of A are (2,3) and the coordinates of A' are (2,-5). The midpoint formula is ((x1+x!2)/2 , (y1+y2)/2). So, the midpoint between A and A' is ((2+2)/2 , (3+(-5))/2) = (2, -1).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the midpoint between B and B'\nThe coordinates of B are (7,8) and the coordinates of B' are (7,-10). Using the midpoint formula, the midpoint between B and B' is ((7+7)/2 , (8+(-10))/2) = (7, -1).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the midpoint between C and C'\nThe coordinates of C are (-4,6) and the coordinates of C' are (-4,-8). Using the midpoint formula, the midpoint between C and C' is ((-4+(-4))/2 , (6+(-8))/2) = (-4, -1).\n\n## Step 6: Determine the equation of the line\nSince all midpoints have the same y-coordinate (-1), the line of reflection is horizontal. A horizontal line has an equation of the form y = b, where b is the y-coordinate of any point on the line.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{y = -1}$",

The midpoint formula is $(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$. For $A$ and $A'$, the midpoint is $(\\frac{2+2}{2}, \\frac{3-5}{2}) = (2, -1)$.

  "solution": "Since only the $y$ portions of the coordinates move, we know that the line of reflection must be a horizontal line. Now we just need to find the midpoint between an original point and its reflected image to pinpoint the location of the line. The $y$-coordinate of point $A$ is 3 and the $y$-coordinate of $A'$ is $-5$; therefore, the midpoint is at $(2, -1)$. The line of refection is $\\boxed{y = -1}$.",
