    "## Step 1: Draw and visualize the given triangle ABC and point D.\nFirst, let's visualize the given problem. We have a triangle ABC where AC = BC = 7 and AB = 2. Point D lies on the line AB such that B is between A and D, and CD = 8.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to the right-angled triangles.\nTo find the length of BD, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. Let's draw the altitude from C to AB and denote the foot of this altitude as E. Since AC = BC, triangle ACE and triangle BCE are congruent right-angled triangles.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the height of triangle ABC using the Pythagorean theorem.\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem on triangle ACE or BCE, we can find the height CE. We have CE = sqrt(AC^2 - AE^2) = sqrt(7^2 - 1^2) = sqrt(49 - 1) = sqrt(48).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the length of AE (or BE) using the given information.\nSince AB = 2 and AE = BE due to the congruence of triangles ACE and BCE, we know that AE = BE = 1.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle CDE to find BD.\nNow, let's apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle CDE. We have CD = 8, CE = sqrt(48), and DE = BD + BE. Plugging in the known values, we get 8^2 = (BD + 1)^2 + 48.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the equation from step 5 to find the length of BD.\nExpanding the equation 64 = (BD + 1)^2 + 48, we get (BD + 1)^2 = 64 - 48 = 16. Taking the square root of both sides, we have BD + 1 = 4. Solving for BD, we get BD = 4 - 1 = 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

    "## Step 1: Draw and visualize the given information\nFirst, let's draw the triangle $\\triangle ABC$ and point $D$ according to the given information. We have $AC=BC=7$ and $AB=2$, and $CD=8$. Since $AC=BC$, $\\triangle ABC$ is an isosceles triangle.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the type of triangle and relevant properties\nGiven that $AC=BC$, we know that $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, and the altitude from $C$ to $AB$ will bisect $AB$. Let's denote the point where this altitude meets $AB$ as $E$. Since $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, $AE=EB=1$ because $AB=2$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the altitude\nTo find the length of the altitude $CE$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in $\\triangle CEB$ (or $\\triangle CEA$), where $CE$ is the height. Since $BC=7$ and $EB=1$, we have $CE = \\sqrt{BC^2 - EB^2} = \\sqrt{7^2 - 1^2} = \\sqrt{49 - 1} = \\sqrt{48}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the square root of 48\n$\\sqrt{48}$ can be simplified as $\\sqrt{16 \\times 3} = 4\\sqrt{3}$ because $\\sqrt{16} = 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to $\\triangle CED$\nNow, considering $\\triangle CED$, we know $CD=8$ and $CE=4\\sqrt{3}$. We can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find $ED$. The theorem states $CD^2 = CE^2 + ED^2$. Substituting the known values gives $8^2 = (4\\sqrt{3})^2 + ED^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $ED$\nFrom $8^2 = (4\\sqrt{3})^2 + ED^2$, we get $64 = 48 + ED^2$. Simplifying, $ED^2 = 64 - 48 = 16$, so $ED = \\sqrt{16} = 4$.\n\n## Step 7: Find $BD$\nSince $ED = 4$ and $EB = 1$, $BD = ED - EB = 4 - 1 = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
