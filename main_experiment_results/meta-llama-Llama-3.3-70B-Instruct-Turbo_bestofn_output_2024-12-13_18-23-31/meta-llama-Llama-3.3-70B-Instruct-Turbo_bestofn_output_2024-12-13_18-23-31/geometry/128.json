    "## Step 1: Determine the volume of the large hemisphere-shaped bowl.\nThe volume \\(V\\) of a hemisphere with radius \\(r\\) is given by \\(V = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3\\). Since the radius of the large hemisphere-shaped bowl is 1 foot, we can calculate its volume by substituting \\(r = 1\\) into the formula: \\(V_{large} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi (1)^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\) cubic feet.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the volume of chocolate each smaller mold will receive.\nThe total volume of chocolate from the large bowl is evenly distributed among 27 smaller hemisphere-shaped molds. Therefore, the volume of chocolate each smaller mold will receive is \\(V_{small} = \\frac{V_{large}}{27} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}\\pi}{27} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi \\times \\frac{1}{27} = \\frac{2}{81}\\pi\\) cubic feet.\n\n## Step 3: Find the radius of each smaller hemisphere-shaped mold.\nThe volume of each smaller hemisphere-shaped mold is given by \\(V_{small} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the smaller mold. We already know that \\(V_{small} = \\frac{2}{81}\\pi\\). Setting these equal gives \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{81}\\pi\\). Simplifying this equation to solve for \\(r\\) gives \\(r^3 = \\frac{2}{81} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{1}{27}\\), and therefore \\(r = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$",
