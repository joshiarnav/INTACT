    "## Step 1: Recall that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.\nWe know that $\\angle PQR = 63^\\circ$ and $\\angle QPR = 59^\\circ$. To find $\\angle QRP$, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the measure of angle $\\angle QRP$.\nUsing the fact from step 1, $\\angle PQR + \\angle QPR + \\angle QRP = 180^\\circ$. Substituting the given values, $63^\\circ + 59^\\circ + \\angle QRP = 180^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle QRP = 180^\\circ - 63^\\circ - 59^\\circ = 58^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 3: Recognize that the line from $R$ to $C$ bisects $\\angle QRP$ because $C$ is the center of the inscribed circle.\nSince the line from $R$ to $C$ bisects $\\angle QRP$, $\\angle QRC = \\frac{1}{2} \\angle QRP$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the measure of angle $\\angle QRC$.\nUsing the result from step 2, $\\angle QRP = 58^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle QRC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 58^\\circ = 29^\\circ$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{29}$",

Therefore, $\\angle QRC$ is half of $\\angle QRP$ because $C$ lies on the angle bisector of $\\angle QRP$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $\\angle QRC$.\nSince $\\angle QRP = 58^\\circ$, $\\angle QRC$ is half of this, so $\\angle QRC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 58^\\circ = 29^\\circ$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{29}$",
