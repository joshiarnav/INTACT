    "## Step 1: The given figure consists of a hexagon inscribed within a rectangle, with the rectangle's dimensions being 6 units in length and 4 units in width.\nThe area of the rectangle can be calculated by multiplying its length and width, giving us $6 \\times 4 = 24$ square units.\n\n## Step 2: To find the area of the hexagon, we need to subtract the areas of the four right-angled triangles from the area of the rectangle.\nEach of the four triangles has a base of 1 unit and a height of 3 units. The area of a triangle is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\times base \\times height$. Substituting the values, we get $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 3 = \\frac{3}{2}$ square units for each triangle.\n\n## Step 3: Since there are four such triangles, the total area of the triangles is $4 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 6$ square units.\nNow, to find the area of the hexagon, we subtract the total area of the triangles from the area of the rectangle, which gives us $24 - 6 = 18$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$",

The triangles are formed by the diagonal lines connecting the vertices of the hexagon, while the rectangle is formed by the horizontal and vertical lines.\n## Step 3:  We know that each triangle has a base of 1 unit and a height of 3 units, so the area of each triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 3 = \\frac{3}{2}$ square units.\n## Step 4:  Since there are four such triangles, the total area of the triangles is $4 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 6$ square units.\n## Step 5:  The rectangle has a length of 6 units and a width of 4 units, so its area is $6 \\times 4 = 24$ square units.\n## Step 6:  However, the area of the hexagon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the four triangles, so we subtract the total area of the triangles from the area of the rectangle to get the area of the hexagon.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the area of the hexagon is $24 - 6 = 18$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$",
    "## Step 1: To find the area of the given hexagon, we should start by identifying the shapes that form it.\nThe hexagon can be divided into smaller, more manageable shapes to calculate its total area.\n\n## Step 2: Looking at the hexagon, we notice that it is made up of 4 triangles and a rectangle.\nThese triangles and the rectangle are formed by the lines connecting the dots in the diagram.\n\n## Step 3: We should calculate the area of each individual shape: the 4 triangles and the rectangle.\nThis will involve determining the base and height of each triangle and the length and width of the rectangle.\n\n## Step 4: The 4 triangles have a base of 1 unit and a height of 3 units.\nUsing the formula for the area of a triangle (Area = 0.5 * base * height), we can calculate the area of one triangle and then multiply it by 4 to get the total area of all the triangles.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the area of one triangle.\nArea = 0.5 * base * height = 0.5 * 1 * 3 = 1.5 square units.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total area of all 4 triangles.\nTotal area of triangles = 4 * area of one triangle = 4 * 1.5 = 6 square units.\n\n## Step 7: Next, we calculate the area of the rectangle.\nThe length of the rectangle is 6 units (from -3 to 3 on the x-axis) and the width is 4 units (from -2 to 2 on the y-axis, but considering the hexagon's boundaries, it is actually 4 units from the top to the bottom of the rectangle, including the parts outside the hexagon which will be subtracted by the triangles).\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the area of the rectangle.\nArea of rectangle = length * width = 6 * 4 = 24 square units.\n\n## Step 9: However, we need to adjust our understanding of the rectangle's dimensions based on the diagram.\nThe rectangle that is actually part of the hexagon has a length of 6 units and a width of 4 units, but the calculation should consider the space occupied by the triangles.\n\n## Step 10: To find the area of the hexagon, we should subtract the total area of the triangles from the area of the rectangle that bounds the hexagon.\nThis will give us the area of the hexagon itself.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the area of the hexagon.\nArea of hexagon = Area of rectangle - Total area of triangles = 24 - 6 = 18 square units, but considering the actual space occupied and the method of calculation, the initial assessment needs adjustment.\n\n## Step 12: Adjusting the calculation based on a clearer understanding of the shapes involved.\nThe correct approach should involve recognizing the hexagon as being formed by a rectangle with two triangles removed from it, not adding triangles to a rectangle.\n\n## Step 13: Reassessing the dimensions and the shapes involved in the hexagon.\nThe correct dimensions and calculation method should reflect the geometry of the given figure accurately.\n\n## Step 14: The hexagon can be seen as a rectangle with a width of 6 units and a height of 4 units, minus the areas of the 4 triangles.\nHowever, considering the arrangement, the triangles are already part of the space inside the rectangle that bounds the hexagon.\n\n## Step 15: Final calculation of the hexagon's area.\nArea = Area of the rectangle that encompasses the hexagon - Area of the 4 triangles that are outside the hexagon but inside the bounding rectangle.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$"
