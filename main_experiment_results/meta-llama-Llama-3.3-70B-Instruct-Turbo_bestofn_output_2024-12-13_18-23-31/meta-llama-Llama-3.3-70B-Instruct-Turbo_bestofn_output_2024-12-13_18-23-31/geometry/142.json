    "To compute $\\sin 60^\\circ$, we should recall the definition of sine in a right-angled triangle. The sine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.\n\n## Step 1: Recall the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle\nA 30-60-90 triangle has specific side length ratios. The side opposite the $30^\\circ$ angle is in the ratio $1$, the side opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle is in the ratio $\\sqrt{3}$, and the hypotenuse is in the ratio $2$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the definition of sine to the 60-degree angle\nGiven the ratios, the side opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle is $\\sqrt{3}$ and the hypotenuse is $2$. Therefore, $\\sin 60^\\circ = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$",
