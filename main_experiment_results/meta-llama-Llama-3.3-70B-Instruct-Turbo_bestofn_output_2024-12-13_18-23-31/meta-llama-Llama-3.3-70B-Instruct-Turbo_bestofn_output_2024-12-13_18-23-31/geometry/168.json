    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and define the parameters\nTo solve this problem, we first need to understand the geometric configuration described. We have a square and a circle intersecting in such a way that each side of the square intersects the circle, creating a chord on the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle. Let's denote the radius of the circle as $r$. This means each chord created on the circle by the sides of the square has a length of $r$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the side length of the square\nGiven that each chord of the circle (created by the sides of the square) is equal in length to the radius of the circle, we can use this information to find the side length of the square. Drawing a line from the center of the circle to the midpoint of one of these chords (which is also a side of the square) creates a right triangle. This line acts as the height of the right triangle, and half of the chord acts as the base. Since the chord's length is $r$, half of the chord is $r/2$. The hypotenuse of this right triangle is the radius of the circle, $r$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the height (which is also half the side length of the square) as $\\sqrt{r^2 - (\\frac{r}{2})^2} = \\sqrt{r^2 - \\frac{r^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3r^2}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}r}{2}$. Therefore, the full side length of the square is $2 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}r}{2} = \\sqrt{3}r$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the areas of the square and the circle\nThe area of the square, $A_{square}$, is found by squaring the side length of the square: $A_{square} = (\\sqrt{3}r)^2 = 3r^2$. The area of the circle, $A_{circle}$, is given by the formula $\\pi r^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle\nThe ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{A_{square}}{A_{circle}} = \\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}$. Simplifying this expression, we can cancel out $r^2$ from the numerator and the denominator, leaving $\\frac{3}{\\pi}$ as the ratio.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$",
    "## Step 1: Draw the figure to understand the problem\nTo solve this problem, we first need to draw the figure of a square and a circle intersecting in such a way that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle. Let's denote the radius of the circle as 'r'. Drawing this figure will help us visualize the problem.\n\n## Step 2: Find the length of the side of the square\nBy drawing the figure, we can observe that the length of the side of the square is equal to 'r' times the square root of 3. This can be derived by considering the equilateral triangle formed by the radii of the circle and the chord of the circle that lies on the side of the square.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area of the square\nThe area of the square can be calculated using the formula $side^2$. Since the length of the side of the square is $r\\sqrt{3}$, the area of the square is $(r\\sqrt{3})^2 = 3r^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the circle\nThe area of the circle can be calculated using the formula $\\pi r^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle\nTo find the ratio, we will divide the area of the square by the area of the circle. So, the ratio is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the ratio\nWe can simplify the ratio by cancelling out the $r^2$ term. The simplified ratio is $\\frac{3}{\\pi}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$",
    "## Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric relationship between the square and the circle and how they intersect. Each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle.\n\n## Step 2: Drawing the Diagram\nDrawing a diagram will help visualize the problem. When we draw the square and the circle according to the given conditions, we can observe the geometric relationships and possibly find similar triangles or useful angles.\n\n## Step 3: Identifying Key Geometric Properties\nBy drawing the radii to the endpoints of the chord (which is also the side of the square), we form an equilateral triangle because the chord's length is equal to the radius of the circle. This means each angle in this triangle is 60 degrees.\n\n## Step 4: Finding the Side Length of the Square\nSince we have an equilateral triangle, and we know that the radius of the circle equals the side of the square divided by \u221a3 (from the properties of the 30-60-90 triangle formed when drawing the altitude of the equilateral triangle), we can find the relationship between the radius of the circle and the side length of the square.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the Ratio of Areas\nThe area of the square is \\(s^2\\), where \\(s\\) is the length of a side. The area of the circle is \\(\\pi r^2\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius. We need to express \\(s\\) in terms of \\(r\\) to find the ratio of the areas.\n\n## Step 6: Expressing Side Length of Square in Terms of Radius\nGiven that the chord (side of the square) forms an equilateral triangle with the radii, the side of the square \\(s = r\\sqrt{3}\\), because in a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides opposite these angles is \\(1 : \\sqrt{3} : 2\\), and here the radius acts as the side opposite the 30-degree angle.\n\n## Step 7: Calculating the Areas\nThe area of the square is \\(s^2 = (r\\sqrt{3})^2 = 3r^2\\). The area of the circle is \\(\\pi r^2\\).\n\n## Step 8: Finding the Ratio\nThe ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is \\(\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2} = \\frac{3}{\\pi}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$"

Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.",
