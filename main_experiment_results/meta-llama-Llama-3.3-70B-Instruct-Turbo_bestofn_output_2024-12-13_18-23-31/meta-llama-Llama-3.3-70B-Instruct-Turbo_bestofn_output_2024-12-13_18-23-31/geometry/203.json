    "## Step 1: Recall that the measure of an angle at the center of a circle is twice the measure of the angle at the circumference of the circle that subtends the same arc.\nThis principle can be used to find the measure of angles in a triangle inscribed in a circle.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the angles given at the center of the circle.\nThe given angles at the center of the circle are $110^\\circ$ and $100^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the measure of the third angle at the center of the circle.\nSince the sum of the angles around a point is $360^\\circ$, the third angle at the center can be found by subtracting the sum of the given angles from $360^\\circ$. Therefore, the third angle at the center is $360^\\circ - 110^\\circ - 100^\\circ = 150^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the principle from step 1 to find the measure of angle BAC.\nSince $\\angle BAC$ is the angle at the circumference of the circle that subtends the same arc as the $150^\\circ$ angle at the center, $\\angle BAC$ is half of $150^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle BAC = 150^\\circ / 2 = 75^\\circ$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{75}$",

  "solution": "We can see that $\\angle AOC = 360^\\circ - (110^\\circ + 100^\\circ) = 150^\\circ.$ Now, $\\triangle AOC$ and $\\triangle AOB$ are both isosceles triangles.
