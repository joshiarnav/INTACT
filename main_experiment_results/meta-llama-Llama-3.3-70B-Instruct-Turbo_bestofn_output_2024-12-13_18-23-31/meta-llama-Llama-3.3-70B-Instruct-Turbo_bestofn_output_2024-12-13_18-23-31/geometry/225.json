  "problem": "Jimmy owns a cube-shaped container that measures $10$ inches on each side. He fills this container with water until it is half full. Then he throws ten giant ice cubes that measure $2$ inches on each side into the container. In inches cubed, how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water?",

    "## Step 1: Calculate the volume of the container.\nThe container is cube-shaped and measures 10 inches on each side, so its volume is $10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 1000$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the volume of water in the container.\nSince Jimmy fills the container until it is half full, the volume of water is half the volume of the container, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1000 = 500$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the volume of a single giant ice cube.\nEach giant ice cube measures 2 inches on each side, so its volume is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total volume of the ten giant ice cubes.\nJimmy throws ten giant ice cubes into the container, so their total volume is $10 \\times 8 = 80$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total volume occupied by water and ice.\nThe total volume occupied by water and ice is the sum of their volumes, which is $500 + 80 = 580$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the volume of the container unoccupied by ice or water.\nThe volume of the container unoccupied by ice or water is the volume of the container minus the total volume occupied by water and ice, which is $1000 - 580 = 420$ cubic inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{420}$",
    "## Step 1: Calculate the volume of the container\nThe volume of a cube is calculated by multiplying the length of one side by itself three times. Given that each side of Jimmy's container is $10$ inches, the volume of the container is $10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 1000$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the volume of water in the container\nSince Jimmy fills the container until it is half full, the volume of water in the container is half of the container's total volume, which is $1000 / 2 = 500$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the volume of one giant ice cube\nEach giant ice cube is also a cube, measuring $2$ inches on each side. The volume of one ice cube is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total volume of the ten giant ice cubes\nJimmy throws ten giant ice cubes into the container. The total volume of these ice cubes is $10 \\times 8 = 80$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total volume occupied by water and ice\nTo find the total volume occupied by water and ice, we add the volume of water to the volume of the ice cubes, which gives $500 + 80 = 580$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the volume of the container unoccupied by ice or water\nThe volume of the container unoccupied by ice or water is the total volume of the container minus the volume occupied by water and ice, which is $1000 - 580 = 420$ cubic inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{420}$",
    "## Step 1: Calculate the total volume of the container\nThe total volume of a cube is given by the formula $V = s^3$, where $s$ is the length of one side. In this case, the side length of the container is $10$ inches, so the total volume of the container is $V = 10^3 = 1000$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the volume of the water in the container\nJimmy fills the container until it is half full. The volume of the water is therefore half of the total volume of the container, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1000 = 500$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the volume of a single giant ice cube\nEach giant ice cube measures $2$ inches on each side, and the volume of a cube is given by $V = s^3$. So, the volume of a single giant ice cube is $V = 2^3 = 8$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total volume of all the giant ice cubes\nJimmy throws ten giant ice cubes into the container. The total volume of all the giant ice cubes is $10 \\times 8 = 80$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total volume occupied by water and ice\nThe total volume occupied by water and ice is the sum of the volume of the water and the volume of all the giant ice cubes, which is $500 + 80 = 580$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the volume of the container unoccupied by ice or water\nThe volume of the container unoccupied by ice or water is the difference between the total volume of the container and the total volume occupied by water and ice, which is $1000 - 580 = 420$ cubic inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{420}$"

  "solution": "First let's compute the volume of the container. The container measures $10\\times10\\times10$ so its volume is  $$10\\cdot10\\cdot10=10^3=1000$$inches cubed. Since the container is only half full, there are $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10^3=500$$inches cubed of water in it. Additionally, there are ten ice cubes each with a volume of $2^3$. This means that the total volume of the ice cubes is $$10\\cdot2^3=10\\cdot8=80.$$Altogether, the water and the ice cubes occupy $500+80=580$ inches cubed. This means that there are $1000-580=\\boxed{420}$ inches cubed of space in the container unoccupied by water and ice.",
