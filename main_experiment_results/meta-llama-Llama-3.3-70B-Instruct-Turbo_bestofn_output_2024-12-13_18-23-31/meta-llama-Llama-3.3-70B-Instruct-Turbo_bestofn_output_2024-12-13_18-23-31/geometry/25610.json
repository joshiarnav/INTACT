    "## Step 1: Define the dimensions of the rectangular box\nLet's denote the length, width, and height of the rectangular box as $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Express the sum of the lengths of the twelve edges\nThe sum of the lengths of the twelve edges of the rectangular box can be expressed as $4a + 4b + 4c = 140$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation from step 2\nSimplifying the equation $4a + 4b + 4c = 140$ gives us $a + b + c = 35$.\n\n## Step 4: Express the distance from one corner to the farthest corner\nThe distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner can be expressed as $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = 21$.\n\n## Step 5: Square both sides of the equation from step 4\nSquaring both sides of $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = 21$ gives us $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 441$.\n\n## Step 6: Use the equation from step 3 to find an expression for the sum of the squares of the dimensions\nWe know that $(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ac$. Substituting $a + b + c = 35$ and $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 441$ into this equation gives us $35^2 = 441 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ac$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $2ab + 2bc + 2ac$\nExpanding $35^2$ gives $1225 = 441 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ac$. Simplifying this equation gives $2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 1225 - 441$ which equals $784$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total surface area of the box\nThe total surface area of the box is given by $2ab + 2bc + 2ac$. Since we found $2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 784$, the total surface area of the box is $784$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{784}$",
    "## Step 1: Define the dimensions of the box\nLet's denote the length, width, and height of the rectangular box as $l$, $w$, and $h$ respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Express the given conditions mathematically\nThe sum of the lengths of the twelve edges of the box is $140$, which translates to $4l + 4w + 4h = 140$. Simplifying, we get $l + w + h = 35$.\nThe distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner is $21$, which gives us the equation $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = 21$. Squaring both sides, we obtain $l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = 441$.\n\n## Step 3: Find a relationship between the dimensions\nWe can use the equation $l + w + h = 35$ to find a relationship that helps in calculating the surface area. Squaring this equation gives $l^2 + w^2 + h^2 + 2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 1225$. We already know that $l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = 441$, so substituting this in gives $441 + 2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 1225$. Simplifying, we get $2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 784$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the surface area of the box\nThe total surface area $A$ of the box is given by $A = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh$. From the previous step, we found that $2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 784$, which directly gives us the surface area.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{784}$",
