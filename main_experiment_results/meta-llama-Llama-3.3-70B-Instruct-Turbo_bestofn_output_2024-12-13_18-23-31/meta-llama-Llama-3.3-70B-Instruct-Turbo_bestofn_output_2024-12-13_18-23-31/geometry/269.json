    "To find the area of the triangle, we can use Heron's formula. However, since this triangle is isosceles (two sides are equal), we can also consider using the properties of isosceles triangles to simplify our calculations.\n\nFirst, let's determine the type of the triangle:\n- The given side lengths are 8, 9, and 9.\n- Since two sides are equal (9 and 9), the triangle is isosceles.\n\nFor an isosceles triangle, the altitude (height) to the base is also a median and an angle bisector. This means if we draw a perpendicular from the vertex opposite the base to the base, it will divide the base into two equal segments.\n\nThe base of the triangle is 8 units (the unequal side), and the other two sides are 9 units each.\n\nNow, let's find the height (altitude) of the triangle:\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height. Since the altitude divides the base into two equal parts, each part will be 8 / 2 = 4 units.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem in one of the right triangles formed by the altitude:\n\\[ \\text{Height}^2 + 4^2 = 9^2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Height}^2 + 16 = 81 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Height}^2 = 81 - 16 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Height}^2 = 65 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Height} = \\sqrt{65} \\]\n\nNow that we have the height, we can find the area of the triangle using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times \\sqrt{65} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Area} = 4 \\times \\sqrt{65} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Area} = 4\\sqrt{65} \\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{65}}$",
    "To find the area of a triangle with side lengths 8, 9, and 9, we first recognize that this is an isosceles triangle since two sides have the same length. \n\nStep 1: Determine the type of triangle and the base and height.\n- The base of the triangle can be taken as 8 (the unequal side), and the two equal sides are 9 units each.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the height of the triangle.\n- To find the height, we draw a perpendicular from the vertex opposite the base to the base, which bisects the base due to the triangle's isosceles nature.\n- This creates two right triangles with a base of 4 (half of 8), a hypotenuse of 9, and an unknown height (h).\n- Using the Pythagorean theorem in one of these right triangles: \\(h^2 = 9^2 - 4^2\\).\n- Calculating \\(h^2 = 81 - 16 = 65\\).\n- Therefore, \\(h = \\sqrt{65}\\).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the area of the triangle.\n- The formula for the area of a triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\).\n- Plugging in the values: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times \\sqrt{65}\\).\n- Simplifying: \\(4\\sqrt{65}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{65}}$",
