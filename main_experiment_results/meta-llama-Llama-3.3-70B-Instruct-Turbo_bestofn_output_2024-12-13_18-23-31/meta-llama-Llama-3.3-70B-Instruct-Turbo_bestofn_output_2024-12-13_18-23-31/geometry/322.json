    "To find the new volume of the cylinder, we first need to recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is \\(V = \\pi r^2 h\\), where \\(V\\) is the volume, \\(r\\) is the radius, and \\(h\\) is the height.\n\nGiven that the original volume (\\(V_{original}\\)) is 10 cubic feet, we have:\n\\[V_{original} = \\pi r^2 h = 10\\]\n\nNow, if the radius is doubled (\\(2r\\)) and the height is tripled (\\(3h\\)), we substitute these new values into the volume formula to find the new volume (\\(V_{new}\\)):\n\\[V_{new} = \\pi (2r)^2 (3h)\\]\n\nExpanding the equation:\n\\[V_{new} = \\pi (4r^2) (3h)\\]\n\\[V_{new} = 12 \\pi r^2 h\\]\n\nSince \\(\\pi r^2 h = 10\\) (from the original volume equation), we substitute this back into our equation for \\(V_{new}\\):\n\\[V_{new} = 12 \\times 10\\]\n\\[V_{new} = 120\\]\n\nTherefore, the new volume of the cylinder is 120 cubic feet.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{120}$",

  "solution": "Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively.  The new cylinder has volume \\[\n\\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\\pi r^2 h,\n\\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume.  Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.",
