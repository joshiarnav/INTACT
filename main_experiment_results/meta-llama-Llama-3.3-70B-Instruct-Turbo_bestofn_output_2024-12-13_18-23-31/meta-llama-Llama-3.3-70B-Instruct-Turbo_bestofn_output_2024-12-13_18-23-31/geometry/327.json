    "## Step 1: To find the perimeter of one of the congruent quadrilaterals, we first need to determine the points where the line $y = x/2$ intersects the sides of the square.\nThe line $y = x/2$ will intersect two sides of the square: the right side and the left side. The right side of the square is the line $x = a$, and the left side is the line $x = -a$.\n\n## Step 2: Find the intersection points of the line $y = x/2$ with the right and left sides of the square.\nFor the right side, $x = a$, so $y = a/2$. Thus, the intersection point on the right side is $(a, a/2)$.\nFor the left side, $x = -a$, so $y = -a/2$. Thus, the intersection point on the left side is $(-a, -a/2)$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral.\nThe quadrilateral has vertices at $(-a, -a)$, $(-a, -a/2)$, $(a, a/2)$, and $(a, -a)$. We need to calculate the lengths of its sides to find the perimeter.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the lengths of the sides.\n- The length of the side from $(-a, -a)$ to $(-a, -a/2)$ is $|-a/2 - (-a)| = |a/2| = a/2$.\n- The length of the side from $(-a, -a/2)$ to $(a, a/2)$ can be found using the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(-a - a)^2 + (-a/2 - a/2)^2} = \\sqrt{(-2a)^2 + (-a)^2} = \\sqrt{4a^2 + a^2} = \\sqrt{5a^2} = a\\sqrt{5}$.\n- The length of the side from $(a, a/2)$ to $(a, -a)$ is $|-a - a/2| = |-3a/2| = 3a/2$.\n- The length of the side from $(a, -a)$ to $(-a, -a)$ is $|-a - a| = |-2a| = 2a$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the perimeter of the quadrilateral.\nThe perimeter $P$ is the sum of all the side lengths: $P = a/2 + a\\sqrt{5} + 3a/2 + 2a$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the perimeter expression.\n$P = a/2 + 3a/2 + 2a + a\\sqrt{5} = 4a + a\\sqrt{5}$.\n\n## Step 7: Divide the perimeter by $a$ to get the final value.\n$P/a = (4a + a\\sqrt{5})/a = 4 + \\sqrt{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4 + \\sqrt{5}}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the points where the line intersects the square.\nTo find the intersection points, we consider the vertices of the square and the equation of the line $y = \\frac{x}{2}$. The line intersects two sides of the square, specifically the right and left sides, because its slope is less than the slope of the line connecting the top-left and bottom-right vertices of the square but greater than the slope of the line connecting the top-right and bottom-left vertices.\n\n## Step 2: Find the intersection points of the line with the sides of the square.\nThe line intersects the right side of the square where $x = a$. Substituting $x = a$ into the equation $y = \\frac{x}{2}$ gives $y = \\frac{a}{2}$. Thus, one intersection point is $(a, \\frac{a}{2})$.\nThe line intersects the left side of the square where $x = -a$. Substituting $x = -a$ into the equation $y = \\frac{x}{2}$ gives $y = -\\frac{a}{2}$. Thus, the other intersection point is $(-a, -\\frac{a}{2})$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral.\nThe quadrilateral formed by the line cutting the square has vertices at $(-a, -a)$, $(-a, -\\frac{a}{2})$, $(a, \\frac{a}{2})$, and $(a, -a)$. The lengths of its sides are as follows:\n- The vertical segment from $(-a, -a)$ to $(-a, -\\frac{a}{2})$ has a length of $\\frac{a}{2}$.\n- The segment from $(-a, -\\frac{a}{2})$ to $(a, \\frac{a}{2})$ can be calculated using the distance formula, $d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Substituting the given points yields $d = \\sqrt{(a - (-a))^2 + (\\frac{a}{2} - (-\\frac{a}{2}))^2} = \\sqrt{(2a)^2 + (a)^2} = \\sqrt{4a^2 + a^2} = \\sqrt{5a^2} = a\\sqrt{5}$.\n- The vertical segment from $(a, \\frac{a}{2})$ to $(a, -a)$ has a length of $\\frac{3a}{2}$.\n- The horizontal segment from $(-a, -a)$ to $(a, -a)$ has a length of $2a$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the perimeter of the quadrilateral.\nThe perimeter $P$ of the quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of its sides:\n$P = \\frac{a}{2} + a\\sqrt{5} + \\frac{3a}{2} + 2a$.\nSimplifying gives:\n$P = \\frac{a}{2} + \\frac{3a}{2} + 2a + a\\sqrt{5} = \\frac{4a}{2} + 2a + a\\sqrt{5} = 2a + 2a + a\\sqrt{5} = 4a + a\\sqrt{5}$.\n\n## Step 5: Divide the perimeter by $a$ to find the value asked for in the problem.\n$\\frac{P}{a} = \\frac{4a + a\\sqrt{5}}{a} = 4 + \\sqrt{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4 + \\sqrt{5}}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the intersection points of the line y = x/2 with the sides of the square.\nTo find these points, we need to consider the line equation y = x/2 and the equations of the lines representing the sides of the square. The sides of the square are given by the equations y = a, y = -a, x = a, and x = -a.\n\n## Step 2: Find the intersection points of the line y = x/2 with the sides of the square.\n- Intersection with the right side (x = a): Substituting x = a into y = x/2 gives y = a/2. So, one intersection point is (a, a/2).\n- Intersection with the left side (x = -a): Substituting x = -a into y = x/2 gives y = -a/2. So, another intersection point is (-a, -a/2).\n- Intersection with the top side (y = a): Substituting y = a into y = x/2 gives x = 2a, but this point lies outside the square since x cannot exceed a. Thus, we only consider intersections with the vertical sides.\n- Intersection with the bottom side (y = -a): Similarly, substituting y = -a into y = x/2 gives x = -2a, which also lies outside the square.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral formed by the line y = x/2 and the square.\nThe quadrilateral has vertices at (-a, -a), (-a, -a/2), (a, a/2), and (a, -a). The lengths of its sides are:\n- From (-a, -a) to (-a, -a/2): |(-a/2) - (-a)| = a/2.\n- From (-a, -a/2) to (a, a/2): This is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 2a (horizontal) and a (vertical), so its length is sqrt((2a)^2 + a^2) = sqrt(4a^2 + a^2) = sqrt(5a^2) = asqrt(5).\n- From (a, a/2) to (a, -a): |(-a) - (a/2)| = 3a/2.\n- From (a, -a) to (-a, -a): 2a (this is one of the sides of the square).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the perimeter of one of the congruent quadrilaterals.\nThe perimeter P = a/2 + asqrt(5) + 3a/2 + 2a. Simplifying, P = a/2 + 3a/2 + 2a + asqrt(5) = 4a + asqrt(5).\n\n## Step 5: Divide the perimeter by a to find the value expressed in terms of a.\nPerimeter divided by a = (4a + asqrt(5)) / a = 4 + sqrt(5).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4 + \\sqrt{5}}$"
