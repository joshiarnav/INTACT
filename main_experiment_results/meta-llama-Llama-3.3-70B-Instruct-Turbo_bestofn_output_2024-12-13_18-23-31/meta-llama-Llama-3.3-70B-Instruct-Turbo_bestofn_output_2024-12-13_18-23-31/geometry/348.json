    "## Step 1: Calculate the length of the base edges\nThe pyramid has a square base with each side measuring 10 cm. Since the base is a square, all four base edges are equal in length, each being 10 cm.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the length of the slant edges\nTo find the length of the slant edges, we need to consider the right triangle formed by the height of the pyramid (12 cm), half the diagonal of the base, and the slant edge. The diagonal of the base can be found using the Pythagorean theorem since the base is a square. The diagonal (d) of the base is given by $d = \\sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = \\sqrt{200} = 10\\sqrt{2}$ cm. Half of this diagonal is $5\\sqrt{2}$ cm.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of a slant edge\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, the length of a slant edge (l) can be calculated as $l = \\sqrt{(12)^2 + (5\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 50} = \\sqrt{194}$ cm.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the numerical value of the length of a slant edge\nCalculating the numerical value: $l \\approx \\sqrt{194} \\approx 13.9284$ cm.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the sum of all edge lengths\nThe pyramid has 4 base edges and 4 slant edges. The sum of all edge lengths is $4 \\times 10 + 4 \\times 13.9284 = 40 + 55.7136 = 95.7136$ cm.\n\n## Step 6: Round the sum to the nearest whole number\nRounded to the nearest whole number, the sum is approximately 96 cm.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{96}$",
    "## Step 1: Calculate the length of the edges on the base of the pyramid\nThe base of the pyramid is a square with each side measuring 10 cm. Since there are 4 edges on the base, the total length of these edges is 4 * 10 = 40 cm.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the length of the slant edges\nTo find the length of the slant edges, we need to consider the right triangle formed by the height of the pyramid (12 cm), half the diagonal of the base, and the slant edge. The diagonal of the base can be found using the Pythagorean theorem since the base is a square. The diagonal (d) of the base is given by d = sqrt(10^2 + 10^2) = sqrt(200) = 10 * sqrt(2) cm. Half of this diagonal is 5 * sqrt(2) cm.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the length of a slant edge\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle formed by the height (12 cm), half the diagonal of the base (5 * sqrt(2) cm), and the slant edge (se), we have se = sqrt((12)^2 + (5 * sqrt(2))^2) = sqrt(144 + 50) = sqrt(194) cm.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total length of all slant edges\nThere are 4 slant edges, so the total length of these edges is 4 * sqrt(194) cm.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the numerical value of the total length of the slant edges\nUsing a calculator, sqrt(194) is approximately 13.9284 cm. Thus, the total length of the slant edges is 4 * 13.9284 = 55.7136 cm.\n\n## Step 6: Add the lengths of the base edges and the slant edges to find the total length of all edges\nThe total length of all edges = length of base edges + length of slant edges = 40 cm + 55.7136 cm.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total length of all edges and round to the nearest whole number\nTotal length = 40 + 55.7136 = 95.7136 cm. Rounded to the nearest whole number, the total length is approximately 96 cm.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{96}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the geometry of the right pyramid\nThe pyramid has a square base with each side measuring 10 cm. The height of the pyramid, from the center of the base to the peak, is 12 cm.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the length of the edges on the base\nSince the base is a square with each side measuring 10 cm, the length of the edges on the base is 10 cm. There are 4 such edges.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the length of the slant edges\nTo find the length of the slant edges, we need to consider the right triangle formed by the height of the pyramid (12 cm), half the diagonal of the base, and the slant edge. The diagonal of the base can be found using the Pythagorean theorem on the square base, where the diagonal is the hypotenuse. Since the base is a square, the diagonal (d) can be calculated using the formula $d = \\sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = \\sqrt{200}$. However, for the slant edge calculation, we only need half of this diagonal. The half diagonal is $\\frac{\\sqrt{200}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of a slant edge\nThe length of a slant edge (s) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: $s = \\sqrt{12^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{200}}{2}\\right)^2}$. Simplifying inside the square root: $s = \\sqrt{144 + \\frac{200}{4}} = \\sqrt{144 + 50} = \\sqrt{194}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the numerical value of the length of a slant edge\nCalculating $\\sqrt{194}$ gives approximately 13.928.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total length of all edges\nThe pyramid has 4 base edges and 4 slant edges. The total length of the edges is $4 \\times 10 + 4 \\times \\sqrt{194}$. Substituting the value of $\\sqrt{194}$ with its approximation: $40 + 4 \\times 13.928 = 40 + 55.712 = 95.712$.\n\n## Step 7: Round the total length to the nearest whole number\nRounding 95.712 to the nearest whole number gives 96.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{96}$"

The base has side $10$, so the diagonal will satisfy: $$d^2=10^2+10^2=200$$ $$d=10\\sqrt{2}$$ Half of this is $5\\sqrt{2}$.  Now we can look at the right triangle formed by the altitude from the vertex of the pyramid, the line just drawn in, and with hypotenuse as the edge we need to find the length of.  The length of this edge is: $$\\sqrt{12^2+(5\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{144+50}=\\sqrt{194}\\approx 13.928$$ The total length of all edges is: $$4(10)+4(13.928)\\approx \\boxed{ 96}$$",
