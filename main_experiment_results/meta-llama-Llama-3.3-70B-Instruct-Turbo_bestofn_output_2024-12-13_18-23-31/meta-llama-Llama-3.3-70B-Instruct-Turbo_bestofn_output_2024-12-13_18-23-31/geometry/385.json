    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a right, rectangular prism, and we need to find its volume in cubic inches. The side, front, and bottom faces of the prism have areas of 15 square inches, 10 square inches, and 6 square inches, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Define the dimensions of the prism\nLet's denote the length, width, and height of the prism as $l$, $w$, and $h$, respectively.\n\n## Step 3: Set up equations based on the given areas\nThe areas of the side, front, and bottom faces can be represented by the equations:\n$lw = 6$ (bottom face),\n$lh = 15$ (side face),\n$wh = 10$ (front face).\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equations to find the volume\nTo find the volume, we need to calculate $lwh$. One way to do this is to multiply all three equations together:\n$(lw)(lh)(wh) = 6 \\times 15 \\times 10$.\nThis simplifies to:\n$l^2w^2h^2 = 900$.\nTaking the square root of both sides gives us:\n$lwh = \\sqrt{900}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the volume\nSince $\\sqrt{900} = 30$, the volume of the prism is $30$ cubic inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$",
    "## Step 1: Define the variables for the dimensions of the rectangular prism\nLet's denote the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism as $l$, $w$, and $h$, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Establish the equations based on the given areas of the faces\nGiven that the side, front, and bottom faces have areas of 15 square inches, 10 square inches, and 6 square inches, we can write the following equations:\n- $l \\times h = 15$\n- $l \\times w = 10$\n- $w \\times h = 6$\n\n## Step 3: Solve the system of equations to find the values of $l$, $w$, and $h$\nFrom the equation $w \\times h = 6$, we can express $w$ as $w = \\frac{6}{h}$.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute $w$ from Step 3 into the equation $l \\times w = 10$ to find $l$ in terms of $h$\nSubstituting $w = \\frac{6}{h}$ into $l \\times w = 10$, we get $l \\times \\frac{6}{h} = 10$, which simplifies to $l = \\frac{10h}{6} = \\frac{5h}{3}$.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute $l$ from Step 4 into the equation $l \\times h = 15$ to solve for $h$\nSubstituting $l = \\frac{5h}{3}$ into $l \\times h = 15$, we get $\\frac{5h}{3} \\times h = 15$, which simplifies to $\\frac{5h^2}{3} = 15$. Solving for $h$ gives $5h^2 = 45$, and thus $h^2 = 9$, leading to $h = 3$ (since $h$ must be positive).\n\n## Step 6: Use the value of $h$ to find $w$ and then $l$\nWith $h = 3$, from $w \\times h = 6$, we find $w = \\frac{6}{3} = 2$.\nThen, using $l \\times w = 10$ and $w = 2$, we find $l = \\frac{10}{2} = 5$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the volume of the rectangular prism\nThe volume $V$ of a rectangular prism is given by $V = l \\times w \\times h$. Substituting the values of $l = 5$, $w = 2$, and $h = 3$ into the formula gives $V = 5 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 30$ cubic inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$",

Multiplying both sides by $w^2$ gives $60 = 15w^2$. Dividing both sides by 15 gives $4 = w^2$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $w = 2$ (since $w$ must be positive).\n\n## Step 8: Find $l$ and $h$ using $w$\nWith $w = 2$, from $l \\times w = 6$, we get $l = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$. And from $w \\times h = 10$, we get $h = \\frac{10}{2} = 5$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the volume\nThe volume $V$ of a rectangular prism is given by $V = l \\times w \\times h$. Substituting $l = 3$, $w = 2$, and $h = 5$ gives $V = 3 \\times 2 \\times 5 = 30!$ cubic inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$"

  "solution": "Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.",
