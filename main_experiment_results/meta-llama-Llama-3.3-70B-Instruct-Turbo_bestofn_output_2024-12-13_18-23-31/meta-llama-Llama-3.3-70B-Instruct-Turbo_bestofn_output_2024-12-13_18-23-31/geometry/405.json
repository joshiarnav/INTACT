    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a triangle $ABC$ with a perimeter of 2007 units. The sides of the triangle are all integers, and their lengths follow the condition $AB < BC \\leq AC$. We need to find the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the triangle inequality\nFor any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. This gives us three inequalities: $AB + BC > AC$, $AB + AC > BC$, and $BC + AC > AB$. Since $AB < BC \\leq AC$, we can use these inequalities to understand the possible range of values for the sides.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the conditions for side lengths\nGiven that $AB < BC \\leq AC$ and the perimeter is 2007, we can express $AC$ in terms of $AB$ and $BC$ as $AC = 2007 - AB - BC$. Substituting this into the inequalities from the triangle inequality, we can derive conditions that $AB$ and $BC$ must satisfy to form a valid triangle.\n\n## Step 4: Minimize $BC - AB$\nTo find the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$, we need to consider how to minimize the difference between $BC$ and $AB$ while still adhering to the triangle inequality and the condition that all sides are integers. Since the sides are integers and $AB < BC$, the smallest possible difference between $BC$ and $AB$ would be 1, achieved when $BC = AB + 1$. However, we must ensure that this setup can satisfy the triangle inequality and the given perimeter condition.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the perimeter and integer constraint\nThe perimeter of 2007 is an odd number, which means that the sum of the three integer side lengths must be odd. Given that $AB < BC \\leq AC$, and knowing that $BC$ and $AB$ are consecutive integers (to minimize $BC - AB$), we can explore how to distribute the total perimeter of 2007 among $AB$, $BC$, and $AC$ to meet these conditions.\n\n## Step 6: Explore specific values for $AB$ and $BC$\nLet's assume $BC = AB + 1$. To minimize $BC - AB$, we want to start with the smallest possible values for $AB$ and $BC$ that could satisfy the triangle inequality and the given conditions. However, since the perimeter is fixed at 2007, and we need to ensure that $AC$ is also an integer and that $BC \\leq AC$, we have to distribute the perimeter in a way that respects these constraints.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the condition to the perimeter\nGiven that the perimeter is 2007, an odd number, and considering that $AB$ and $BC$ are consecutive integers, we can express $AC$ as $2007 - AB - (AB + 1)$. This simplifies to $2007 - 2AB - 1 = 2006 - 2AB$. To ensure $AC$ is an integer and $BC \\leq AC$, we must find integer values of $AB$ and $BC$ that satisfy these conditions and the triangle inequality.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the triangle inequality with $BC = AB + 1$\nSubstituting $BC = AB + 1$ and $AC = 2006 - 2AB$ into the triangle inequalities gives us conditions in terms of $AB$ that must be satisfied. Specifically, $AB + (AB + 1) > 2006 - 2AB$ simplifies to $4AB > 2005$, or $AB > 501.25$. Thus, the smallest integer $AB$ can be is 502, making $BC = 503$.\n\n## Step 9: Check the condition $BC \\leq AC$\nWith $AB = 502$ and $BC = 503$, $AC = 2006 - 2*502 = 2006 - 1004 = 1002$. Since $503 \\leq 1002$, this condition is satisfied.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate $BC - AB$\nFinally, with $BC = 503$ and $AB = 502$, the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$ is $503 - 502 = 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
    "## Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe problem involves finding the smallest possible difference in lengths between two sides of a triangle, given that the triangle has a perimeter of 2007 units and all sides are integers with $AB < BC \\leq AC$.\n\n## Step 2: Applying the Triangle Inequality\nFor any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. This gives us three inequalities: $AB + BC > AC$, $AB + AC > BC$, and $BC + AC > AB$.\n\n## Step 3: Considering the Perimeter\nThe perimeter of the triangle is 2007 units, meaning $AB + BC + AC = 2007$. Since all sides are integers and $AB < BC \\leq AC$, we need to consider how to distribute the total perimeter among the sides to minimize $BC - AB$.\n\n## Step 4: Minimizing $BC - AB$\nTo minimize $BC - AB$, we want $BC$ to be as close in value to $AB$ as possible, while still adhering to the conditions that $AB < BC \\leq AC$ and satisfying the triangle inequality.\n\n## Step 5: Exploring Possible Distributions\nGiven that the perimeter is odd (2007), and we are looking for integer side lengths, we must ensure that the sum of the two smaller sides is greater than the largest side. A possible approach to minimizing $BC - AB$ is to start with the smallest possible values for $AB$ and $BC$ and see if we can satisfy the conditions.\n\n## Step 6: Using the Condition $AB < BC \\leq AC$\nSince we want to minimize $BC - AB$ and we know $AB + BC + AC = 2007$, let's consider making $AB$ and $BC$ as close as possible. If $AB = BC$, it would violate the $AB < BC$ condition. Thus, the smallest possible difference where $AB$ and $BC$ are integers and $AB < BC$ would be when $BC = AB + 1$.\n\n## Step 7: Checking for Validity\nLet's assume $AB = x$ and $BC = x + 1$. Then, $AC = 2007 - AB - BC = 2007 - x - (x + 1) = 2006 - 2x$. To satisfy the triangle inequality, we must ensure $AB + BC > AC$, $AB + AC > BC$, and $BC + AC > AB$.\n\n## Step 8: Applying the Triangle Inequality with Our Assumptions\n- $AB + BC > AC$ becomes $x + (x + 1) > 2006 - 2x$, simplifying to $4x > 2005$ or $x > 501.25$. Since $x$ must be an integer, $x \\geq 502$.\n- $AB + AC > BC$ becomes $x + (2006 - 2x) > x + 1$, simplifying to $2006 > x + 1$ or $x < 2005$, which is always true given our other constraints.\n- $BC + AC > AB$ becomes $(x + 1) + (2006 - 2x) > x$, simplifying to $2007 > 2x$, or $x < 1003.5$. Since $x$ is an integer, $x \\leq 1003$.\n\n## Step 9: Finding the Smallest Possible $BC - AB$\nGiven $x \\geq 502$ and $x \\leq 1003$, and considering $BC = AB + 1$, the smallest possible value for $BC - AB$ when $AB$ and $BC$ are at their minimum difference (and still satisfying all conditions) would be $1$, as this is the smallest possible integer difference where $AB < BC$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
    "## Step 1: Apply the Triangle Inequality\nThe triangle inequality states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Therefore, for triangle $ABC$, we have: $AB + BC > AC$, $AB + AC > BC$, and $BC + AC > AB$.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the Perimeter and Side Lengths\nGiven that the perimeter of triangle $ABC$ is 2007 units, we can express this as $AB + BC + AC = 2007$. Since all sides are integers and $AB < BC \\leq AC$, we need to find a combination that satisfies these conditions and the triangle inequality.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the Smallest Possible Value of $BC - AB$\nTo minimize $BC - AB$, we want $BC$ to be as small as possible and $AB$ to be as large as possible while still maintaining $AB < BC$. However, because $AB$, $BC$, and $AC$ are all integers and must satisfy the triangle inequality, the smallest possible difference between $BC$ and $AB$ will occur when $AB$ and $BC$ are consecutive integers.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the Condition of Consecutive Integers\nIf $AB$ and $BC$ are consecutive integers, then $BC = AB + 1$. To minimize $BC - AB$, we need to find the smallest possible values for $AB$ and $BC$ that fit this condition and also satisfy the triangle inequality and the perimeter condition.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the Case with the Smallest Possible $AB$ and $BC$\nLet's consider the scenario where $AB$ is the smallest possible integer value. Given $AB < BC \\leq AC$ and the perimeter is 2007, if we start with the smallest possible values for $AB$ and $BC$ and consider them as consecutive integers, we have to ensure that $AC$ can still be an integer and that the triangle inequality holds.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the Perimeter Condition with Consecutive Integers\nIf $BC = AB + 1$, then the perimeter $2007 = AB + (AB + 1) + AC$. Simplifying, $2007 = 2AB + 1 + AC$, or $2006 = 2AB + AC$. Since $AC$ must be greater than or equal to $BC$, and $BC = AB + 1$, $AC \\geq AB + 1$. Substituting $AC$ with $AB + 1$ gives us a starting point to find suitable integer values for $AB$ and $AC$ that satisfy the triangle inequality and the perimeter condition.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $AB$ and $AC$ with the Smallest Possible Difference\nGiven $2006 = 2AB + AC$ and knowing $AC \\geq AB + 1$, let's find integer values of $AB$ and $AC$ that satisfy these conditions and minimize $BC - AB$. Since $BC - AB = 1$ when $BC = AB + 1$, our goal is to confirm that such a scenario is possible under the given constraints.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the Triangle Inequality with Specific Values\nWe need to ensure that the triangle inequality holds for the smallest possible $AB$ and $BC$ with $BC = AB + 1$. This means $AB + (AB + 1) > AC$, $AB + AC > AB + 1$, and $(AB + 1) + AC > AB$. Given $AC \\geq AB + 1$, the critical condition to satisfy is $2AB + 1 > AC$.\n\n## Step 9: Find Suitable Integer Values for $AB$ and $AC$\nLet's consider values for $AB$ and calculate $AC$ based on the perimeter equation $2006 = 2AB + AC$. To minimize $BC - AB$ while ensuring $BC = AB + 1$ and satisfying the triangle inequality, we look for the smallest $AB$ where $AC$ can be an integer and $AC \\geq AB + 1$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate with a Specific Example\nAssuming $AB = x$, then $BC = x + 1$. The perimeter equation becomes $2007 = x + (x + 1) + AC$, which simplifies to $2006 = 2x + AC$. To satisfy the triangle inequality and have $BC - AB = 1$, we need to find an $x$ that allows $AC$ to be an integer and greater than or equal to $x + 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
