    "## Step 1:  To find the area of the square $BCFE$ inscribed in right triangle $AGD$, we can utilize the properties of similar triangles and the relationship between the side lengths of the square and the triangle.\n## Step 2:  Let's denote the side length of the square as $x$, and the length of the line segment $FG$ as $y$. Since $\\triangle AEB \\sim \\triangle FGC$, we can establish a proportion to relate the lengths of corresponding sides.\n## Step 3:  The proportion $\\frac{AB}{x} = \\frac{x}{CD}$ arises from the similarity of the triangles, allowing us to solve for $x$.\n## Step 4:  Plugging in the given values, we get $\\frac{28}{x} = \\frac{x}{58}$, which simplifies to $x^2 = 28 \\cdot 58$.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the area of the square $BCFE$ is given by $x^2$, and substituting the product of $28$ and $58$ yields the area.\n## Step 6:  Hence, we can calculate the area of the square using the derived value of $x^2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1624}$",
