    "## Step 1: Recall the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle\nThe area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the formula for the area of a triangle using its base and height\nThe area of a triangle with base $b$ and height $h$ is given by $\\frac{1}{2}bh$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area of the equilateral triangle $\\triangle ABC$ using the given perpendiculars\nThe area of $\\triangle ABC$ can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of triangles $\\triangle APB$, $\\triangle BPC$, and $\\triangle CPA$. Using the formula from Step 2, we can express the area of $\\triangle ABC$ as $\\frac{1}{2}AB \\cdot PQ + \\frac{1}{2}BC \\cdot PR + \\frac{1}{2}CA \\cdot PS$. Since $\\triangle ABC$ is equilateral, $AB = BC = CA$. Let's denote $AB = s$. Then the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}s \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{2}s \\cdot 2 + \\frac{1}{2}s \\cdot 3 = \\frac{1}{2}s(1 + 2 + 3) = \\frac{1}{2}s \\cdot 6 = 3s$.\n\n## Step 4: Equate the two expressions for the area of $\\triangle ABC$\nFrom Step 1, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$. From Step 3, the area is $3s$. Setting these equal gives $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} = 3s$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the equation from Step 4 for $s$\nMultiplying both sides by $4$ to clear the fraction gives $s^2 \\sqrt{3} = 12s$. Dividing both sides by $s$ (since $s \\neq 0$ as it is the side length of a triangle) gives $s\\sqrt{3} = 12$. Dividing both sides by $\\sqrt{3}$ gives $s = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Rationalizing the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{3}$ gives $s = \\frac{12\\sqrt{3}}{3} = 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$",
