    "## Step 1:  Visualizing the Problem\nImagine a cube with faces $ABCD$ and $BCFG$, where $AB=12$. A beam of light starts at vertex $A$ and reflects off face $BCFG$ at point $P$. The coordinates of $P$ can be considered as $(7,5)$ if we imagine a coordinate system on face $BCFG$ with $B$ as the origin. Given the dimensions, we can visualize the path of the light beam and its reflections within the cube.\n\n## Step 2:  Understanding the Path of the Light Beam\nSince the coordinates of the cube's vertices only involve 0's and 12's, the X, Y, and Z distances traveled by the light must all be divisible by 12. Given that the change in Y is 5 and the change in X is 7, and that 5 and 7 are relatively prime to 12, the light must make 12 reflections onto the XY plane or the face parallel to the XY plane.\n\n## Step 3:  Calculating the Distance Traveled for Each Reflection\nWith each reflection, the distance traveled by the light can be calculated using the distance formula in three dimensions, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{(12^2) + (5^2) + (7^2)} = \\sqrt{144 + !25 + 49} = \\sqrt{218}$ for each reflection.\n\n## Step 4:  Finding the Total Distance Traveled\nSince there are 12 reflections, the total distance traveled by the light from the time it leaves point $A$ until it next reaches a vertex of the cube is $12\\sqrt{218}$.\n\n## Step 5:  Calculating the Final Answer\nTo get the final answer, we need to find $m+n$ where the total distance traveled is given by $m\\sqrt{n}$. Here, $m=12$ and $n=218$, so $m+n = 12 + 218 = 230$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{230}$",

  "solution": "When a light beam reflects off a surface, the path is like that of a ball bouncing. Picture that, and also imagine X, Y, and Z coordinates for the cube vertices. The coordinates will all involve 0's and 12's only, so that means that the X, Y, and Z distance traveled by the light must all be divisible by 12. Since the light's Y changes by 5 and the X changes by 7 (the Z changes by 12, don't worry about that), and 5 and 7 are relatively prime to 12, the light must make 12 reflections onto the XY plane or the face parallel to the XY plane.\nIn each reflection, the distance traveled by the light is $\\sqrt{ (12^2) + (5^2) + (7^2) }$ = $\\sqrt{218}$. This happens 12 times, so the total distance is $12\\sqrt{218}$. $m=12$ and $n=218$, so therefore, the answer is $m+n=\\boxed{230}$.",
