    "## Step 1: Understanding the given information\nWe have two circles, $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$, intersecting at two points, one of which is $(9,6)$. The product of the radii of these circles is $68$. Additionally, the x-axis and the line $y = mx$ (where $m > 0$) are tangent to both circles.\n\n## Step 2: Finding the equation of the line passing through the given point\nGiven that the line $y = mx$ passes through the point $(9,6)$, we can substitute these coordinates into the equation of the line to find $m$. This gives $6 = 9m$, from which we can solve for $m$.\n\n## Step 3: Considering the angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$\nLet's denote the angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$ as $\\theta$.

Additionally, we know that the x-axis and the line $y = mx$ (where $m > 0$) are tangent to both circles.\n\n## Step 2: Considering the angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$\nLet's denote the angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$ as $\\theta$. From the given information, we can infer that the centers of the two circles lie on the angle bisector of this angle. This angle bisector passes through the point $(9,6)$.\n\n## Step 3: Finding the relationship between the centers of the circles and the point $(9,6)$\nThe angle bisector of $\\theta$ is the line $y = x \\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}$. Since this line passes through the point $(9,6)$, we can establish the relation $6 = 9 \\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}$. This allows us to find $\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculating $\\sin{\\theta}$ and $\\cos{\\theta}$\nUsing the half-angle formula, we can calculate $\\sin{\\theta}$ and $\\cos{\\theta}$. From $\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}} = \\frac{2}{3}$, we can derive $\\sin{\\theta} = \\frac{4}{5}$ and $\\cos{\\theta} = \\frac{3}{5}$.\n\n## Step 5: Finding the relationship between $m$ and the trigonometric functions of $\\theta$\nSince $m = \\tan{\\theta}$, we can use the previously calculated values of $\\sin{\\theta}$ and $\\cos{\\theta}$ to find $m$.

    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and visualize the given information\nWe are dealing with two intersecting circles, $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$, with one of the intersection points at $(9,6)$. The product of the radii of these circles is given as $68$. Additionally, we know that the x-axis and the line $y = mx$ (where $m > 0$) are tangent to both circles.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$ to find a relation with the circle centers and the point of intersection\nLet's denote the angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$ as $\\theta$. Then, $\\tan \\theta = m$. Since the line $y=mx$ is tangent to both circles and the x-axis is also tangent to both circles, the centers of the circles lie on the angle bisector of the angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$. The angle bisector of this angle is the line $y = x \\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the relationship between the coordinates of the centers of the circles and the point $(9,6)$\nGiven that $(9,6)$ is on the angle bisector, we can relate the coordinates of the centers of the circles to this point. Since the point $(9,6)$ lies on the line $y = x \\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2}$, we have $6 = 9 \\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2}$. This implies $\\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n## Step 4: Use trigonometric identities to relate $\\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2}$ to $\\tan \\theta$\nUsing the trigonometric identity for the tangent of a half-angle, $\\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{1 - \\cos \\theta}{\\sin \\theta}$, and knowing that $\\tan \\theta = m$, we can relate $\\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2}$ to $m$. We also know that $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{2 \\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2}}{1 - \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2}}$. Substituting $\\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{2}{3}$ into this equation gives us $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}}{1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}}{\\frac{5}{9}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{9}{5} = \\frac{12}{5}$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the given condition that the product of the radii is $68$ and consider the similarity of triangles to find $m$\nHowever, the step above was for understanding the relationship between the angle and the tangent. To actually find $m$, we should consider the geometric relations and the fact that the product of the radii is $68$. Since we need to find $m$ in the form $a\\sqrt{b}/c$ and the question involves the product of radii and the position of the circles, let's focus on the correct approach to utilize the given information about the radii and the point of intersection.\n\n## Step 6: Correctly derive the value of $m$ using the geometric properties of the circles and the given conditions\nGiven the complexity of directly calculating $m$ from the previous steps, we recognize the need to apply geometric principles related to the circles' radii, their points of tangency, and the intersection point. The centers of the two circles must be equidistant from the point $(9,6)$ and lie on the line that bisects the angle between the x-axis and the line $y=mx$. Utilizing the fact that the circles are tangent to both the x-axis and the line $y=mx$, and considering the product of their radii, we can deduce the relationship between the radii and the slope $m$. This involves understanding that the line connecting the centers of the circles, the point of intersection, and the points of tangency with the x-axis and the line $y=mx$ are all related geometrically.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the correct formula or relationship that leads to the calculation of $m$\nGiven that $\\tan \\theta = m$ and utilizing the half-angle formula, we have $\\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{2}{3}$. The relationship between the tangent of an angle and its half-angle, considering the geometry of the problem and the condition involving the radii, should lead us to the correct expression for $m$. However, the critical step involves recognizing the geometric relationships between the circles, the points of tangency, and the intersection point to correctly apply the given conditions and solve for $m$.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the correct geometric and trigonometric relationships to solve for $m$\nThe key insight is to use the given point $(9,6)$, the product of the radii, and the geometric properties of circles and tangents to find the slope $m$. This involves considering the right triangles formed by the radii of the circles to the points of tangency with the x-axis and the line $y=mx$, and applying trigonometric relationships to find $m$. The correct approach should directly utilize the given numeric conditions and geometric properties to solve for $m$ without incorrect assumptions.\n\n## Step 9: Final calculation for $m$ using the correct relationships and given conditions\nGiven the need for a direct and correct calculation, let's reconsider the relationship between the tangent of the angle, the half-angle formula, and the given conditions. Knowing that $\\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{2}{3}$ and utilizing the formula for $\\tan \\theta$ in terms of $\\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2}$, we find that $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{2 \\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2}}{1 - \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2}}$. Substituting $\\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{2}{3}$ into the equation yields $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}}{1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}}{\\frac{5}{9}} = \\frac{12}{5}$. This step correctly calculates $\\tan \\theta$, which equals $m$.\n\n## Step 10: Express $m$ in the required form $a\\sqrt{b}/c$ and calculate the sum $a + b + c$\nThe value of $m$ is $\\frac{12}{5}$, which can be seen as $m = \\frac{12}{5} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 1}{5 \\cdot 1}$. However, to express it in the form $a\\sqrt{b}/c$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers and $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, we recognize that $m = \\frac{12}{5}$ already meets the criteria for $a$ and $c$ being positive integers but does not explicitly require a square root form here since it's a simple fraction. The question's format implies we need to identify $a$, $b$, and $c$ for a more complex fraction involving a square root, but given $m$'s simplicity, we directly identify $a=12$, $b=1$ (since there's no square root explicitly needed for $\\frac{12}{5}$), and $c=5$. Thus, the sum $a + b + c = 12 + 1 + 5 = 18$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
