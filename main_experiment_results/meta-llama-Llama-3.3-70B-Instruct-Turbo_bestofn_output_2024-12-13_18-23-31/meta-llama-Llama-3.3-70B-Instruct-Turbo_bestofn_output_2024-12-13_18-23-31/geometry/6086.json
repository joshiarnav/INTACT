    "## Step 1: Determine the geometry of the problem\nWe have a square $ABCD$ with sides of length 2. The set $S$ consists of all line segments of length 2 with endpoints on adjacent sides of the square.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the shape enclosed by the midpoints of the line segments\nThe midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ form a quarter circle at each corner of the square. This is because the line segments in $S$ can be thought of as the radii of a circle with radius 1 (half the length of the line segment).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area enclosed by the midpoints\nThe total area enclosed by the midpoints is the area of the square minus the areas of the four quarter circles. The area of the square is $2^2 = 4$. The area of each quarter circle is $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi(1)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, so the total area of the four quarter circles is $4 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\pi$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area enclosed by the midpoints\nThe area enclosed by the midpoints is $4 - \\pi$.\n\n## Step 5: Round the area to the nearest hundredth\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the area is $4 - \\pi \\approx 4 - 3.14 = 0.86$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $100k$\nWe are given that the area to the nearest hundredth is $k$, so $k = 0.86$. Therefore, $100k = 100 \\times 0.86 = 86$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{86}$",

The goal is to find the area enclosed by the midpoints of these line segments.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the geometry of the line segments\nWithout loss of generality, we consider the vertices of the square to be at $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, $(0,2)$, and $(2,2)$. Suppose the two endpoints of the segment lie on the two sides of the square determined by the vertex $(0,0)$. Let the coordinates of the two endpoints of the segment be $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the distance formula\nSince the segment has a length of 2, we can use the distance formula to express this relationship as $x^2 + y^2 = 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the midpoint of the segment\nUsing the midpoint formula, we find that the midpoint of the segment has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 5: Distance from the origin to the midpoint\nThe distance $d$ from $(0,0)$ to $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$ can be calculated using the distance formula: $d^2 = \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(x^2 + y^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 4 = 1$.

The area of the square is $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$. The combined area of the four quarter circles is $\\pi \\cdot 1^2 = \\pi$. Therefore, the area enclosed by the midpoints is $4 - \\pi \\approx 0.86$ to the nearest hundredth.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the final answer\nGiven that $k$ is the area to the nearest hundredth, $k = 0.86$.

This is because the line segments in $S$ can be thought of as the radii of a circle with radius 1 (half of the length of the line segment), and their midpoints trace out a quarter circle as the line segments move around each corner.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area enclosed by the midpoints\nThe total area enclosed by the midpoints of the line segments is the area of the square minus the areas of the four quarter circles at the corners.

Suppose the endpoints of the segment lie on the two sides of the square determined by the vertex $(0,0)$. Let the two endpoints of the segment have coordinates $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$. Because the segment has length 2, $x^2+y^2=4$. Using the midpoint formula, we find that the midpoint of the segment has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$.
