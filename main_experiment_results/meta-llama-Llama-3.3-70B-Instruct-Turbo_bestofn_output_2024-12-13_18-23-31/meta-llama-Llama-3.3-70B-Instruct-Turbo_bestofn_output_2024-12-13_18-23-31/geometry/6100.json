    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the given figure\nThe problem involves packing eight circles of diameter 1 in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane and finding the equation of a line that divides the union of these circular regions into two equal areas. The line $l$ has a slope of 3.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the line that divides the region into two equal areas\nTo divide the region into two equal areas, the line must pass through the tangency point of the bottom left circle and the one to its right. Similarly, it should also pass through the tangency of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it. This ensures that the line cuts congruent areas, allowing for the division of the region into two equal areas.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the coordinates of the tangency points\nThe tangency point of the bottom left circle and the one to its right is $\\left(1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. The tangency point of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it is $\\left(\\frac{3}{2},2\\right)$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the coordinates of the tangency points to find the equation of the line\nUsing the coordinates of the two tangency points, we can find the equation of the line. The line passes through $\\left(1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\frac{3}{2},2\\right)$, and it has a slope of 3.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the equation of the line using the point-slope form\nUsing the point-slope form of a line, $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line, we can find the equation of the line.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute the values of the slope and the coordinates of the point into the point-slope form\nSubstituting $m = 3$ and the point $\\left(1, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ into the equation gives $y - \\frac{1}{2} = 3(x - 1)$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the equation to find the line in the form $ax = by + c$\nRearranging the equation to the form $ax = by + c$ yields $6x = 2y + 5$.\n\n## Step 8: Identify the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ and calculate $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$\nFrom the equation $6x = 2y + 5$, we can identify $a = 6$, $b = 2$, and $c = 5$. Then, we can calculate $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 6^2 + 2^2 + 5^2$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$\nCalculating $6^2 + 2^2 + 5^2$ gives $36 + 4 + 25 = 65$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{65}$",

Similarly, it should also pass through the tangency of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it.

Using these coordinates, we can find the equation of the line.\n\n## Step 4: Derive the equation of the line\nWith a slope of 3, the equation of the line can be written as $y = 3x + c$. Substituting the given coordinates, we can solve for $c$. Using $\\left(1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, we get $\\frac{1}{2} = 3(1) + c$, which simplifies to $c = -\\frac{5}{2}$. However, we need to express the equation in the form $ax=by+c$.

    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem presents eight circles of diameter 1 packed in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane. The task is to find the equation of a line with a slope of 3 that divides the union of these circular regions into two equal areas. The line's equation should be in the form $ax = by + c$, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers with a greatest common divisor of 1.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the line's general equation\nThe line $l$ has a slope of 3, so its equation can be written as $y = 3x + c$. However, to match the given form $ax = by + c$, we rearrange it to $3x = y + c$, and then to $3x - y - c = 0$. Comparing with the desired form, we have $a = 3$, $b = 1$, and $c$ needs to be determined.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the value of $c$\nTo find $c$, we need to understand how the line divides the region $\\mathcal{R}$ into two equal areas. The line passes through the tangency point of the bottom left circle and the one to its right. Similarly, it also passes through the tangency of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it. This information will help in finding the value of $c$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the coordinates of the tangency points\nThe bottom left circle has a center at $(1,1)$ and a radius of 1. The circle to its right has a center at $(3,1)$, and they are tangent at $(2,1)$. The top circle in the middle column has a center at $(3,3)$, and the one beneath it has a center at $(3,1)$. They are tangent at $(3,2)$.\n\n## Step 5: Use the coordinates to find $c$\nSince the line passes through $(2,1)$ and $(3,2)$, we can substitute either point into the equation $y = 3x + c$ to solve for $c$. Using $(2,1)$, we have $1 = 3(2) + c$, which simplifies to $1 = 6 + c$, and solving for $c$ gives $c = -5$. However, we need to ensure the equation is in the form $ax = by + c$ and that the coefficients are positive integers.\n\n## Step 6: Finalize the equation and calculate $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$\nThe line's equation in the desired form is $3x = y - 5$, which matches the form $ax = by + c$ when rearranged as $3x - y + 5 = 0$. Thus, $a = 3$, $b = 1$, and $c = 5$. To find $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$, we calculate $3^2 + 1^2 + 5^2 = 9 + 1 + 25 = 35$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{35}$"

  "solution": "The line passing through the tangency point of the bottom left circle and the one to its right and through the tangency of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it is the line we are looking for: a line passing through the tangency of two circles cuts congruent areas, so our line cuts through the four aforementioned circles splitting into congruent areas, and there are an additional two circles on each side.
