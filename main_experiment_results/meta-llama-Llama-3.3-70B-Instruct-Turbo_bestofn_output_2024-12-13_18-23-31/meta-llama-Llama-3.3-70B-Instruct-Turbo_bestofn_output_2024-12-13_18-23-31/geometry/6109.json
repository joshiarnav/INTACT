  "problem": "A right circular cone has base radius $r$ and height $h$. The cone lies on its side on a flat table. As the cone rolls on the surface of the table without slipping, the point where the cone's base meets the table traces a circular arc centered at the point where the vertex touches the table. The cone first returns to its original position on the table after making $17$ complete rotations. The value of $h/r$ can be written in the form $m\\sqrt {n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n$.\n",

    "## Step 1: Understand the path traced by the cone's base as it rolls\nThe cone's base traces a circular path as it rolls on the table. This path is essentially a circle with a radius equal to the slant height of the cone, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem as $\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the circumference of the circular path traced by the cone's base\nThe circumference of the circular path is $2\\pi\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$, as it is a circle with radius $\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the circumference of the cone's base\nThe circumference of the cone's base is $2\\pi r$, as it is a circle with radius $r$.\n\n## Step 4: Understand the relationship between the number of rotations and the circumferences\nThe cone makes 17 complete rotations as it traces the circular path once. Therefore, the circumference of the circular path is 17 times the circumference of the cone's base: $2\\pi\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2} = 17(2\\pi r)$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the equation from step 4 to find the relationship between $r$ and $h$\nSimplifying the equation gives $\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2} = 17r$. Squaring both sides of the equation yields $r^2 + h^2 = 289r^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $h/r$\nRearranging the equation from step 5 to solve for $h^2$ gives $h^2 = 288r^2$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $h = 12\\sqrt{2}r$. Therefore, $h/r = 12\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n## Step 7: Find $m + n$ from the expression $h/r = m\\sqrt{n}$\nFrom step 6, $m = 12$ and $n = 2$. So, $m + n = 12 + 2 = 14$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$",
    "## Step 1: Understanding the problem\nThe problem describes a right circular cone rolling on a table and tracing a circular arc. We need to find the ratio of the cone's height to its base radius, given that it returns to its original position after making 17 complete rotations.\n\n## Step 2: Identifying key concepts\nThe path traced by the cone forms a circle with a radius equal to the slant height of the cone, which is given by $\\sqrt{r^{2} + h^{2}}$.
