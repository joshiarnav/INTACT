Since $M$ and $N$ are midpoints, the length of $MN$ is half the difference between the lengths of the bases $AD$ and $BC$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the length of MN\nUsing the given lengths $BC = 1000$ and $AD = 2008$, we can find the length of $MN$ as follows:\n$MN = \\frac{AD - BC}{2} = \\frac{2008 - 1000}{2} = \\frac{1008}{2} = 504$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{504}$",
