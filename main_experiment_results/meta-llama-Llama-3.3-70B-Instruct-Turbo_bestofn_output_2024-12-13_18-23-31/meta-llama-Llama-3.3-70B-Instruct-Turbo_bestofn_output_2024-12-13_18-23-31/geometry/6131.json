    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and visualize the given information\nWe have a square $ABCD$ and points $E$ and $F$ on sides $AD$ and $BC$, respectively. The segments $BE$, $EF$, and $FD$ are all equal, each measuring 30 units.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the geometrical properties at play\nThe segments $BE$, $EF$, and $FD$ divide the square into three equal horizontal sections. This implies that the square can be divided into three equal parts horizontally, with $EF$ being the middle segment.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the side length of the square\nTo find the area of the square, we first need to find the length of its side. We can utilize the right-angled triangles formed by the segments $BE$, $EF$, and $FD$. Let's denote the side length of the square as $x$. By applying the Pythagorean theorem to one of these triangles, we can find the value of $x$. Specifically, considering the right triangle formed by $BE$, half of $EF$ (since $EF$ is the base of this triangle and equals 30), and half of the side of the square (from $B$ to the midpoint of $AD$), we have: $(\\frac{x}{3})^2 + x^2 = 30^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation derived from the Pythagorean theorem for $x$\nThe equation becomes $\\frac{x^2}{9} + x^2 = 900$. Simplifying this equation, we get $\\frac{10x^2}{9} = 900$. Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{9}{10}$ gives $x^2 = 810$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find $x = \\sqrt{810} = 9\\sqrt{10}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the area of the square\nThe area of the square is given by $x^2$. Since we found $x = 9\\sqrt{10}$, the area is $(9\\sqrt{10})^2 = 81 \\cdot 10 = 810$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{810}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and visualize the square $ABCD$ with points $E$ and $F$.\nWe have a square $ABCD$ where point $E$ lies on side $AD$ and point $F$ lies on side $BC$. The given condition is that $BE = EF = FD = 30$. We need to find the area of the square $ABCD$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the geometric properties of the figure.\nThe segments $BE$, $EF$, and $FD$ divide the square into three equal horizontal sections. Let's denote the side length of the square as $x$. Since $BE = EF = FD = 30$, we can consider the right triangle formed by $BE$, the side of the square, and the segment connecting $E$ to the point directly below $B$ on $AD$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle.\nConsidering the right triangle formed by $BE$, half the side length of the square ($\\frac{x}{2}$), and the segment connecting $E$ to the point directly below $B$ on $AD$, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem: $(\\frac{x}{2})^2 + x^2 = 30^2$. However, recognizing the segments $BE$, $EF$, and $FD$ are equal and form the sides of a larger right triangle with the diagonal of the square being the hypotenuse is key.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the relationship of the segments with the square.\nGiven that $BE = EF = FD = 30$, we notice that $BE$ and $FD$ are the legs of a right triangle where the hypotenuse is the diagonal of the square $ABCD$. However, the diagonal is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the side length of the square. But considering the segments $BE$, $EF$, and $FD$ divide the square into equal parts horizontally and that the triangle formed by connecting points $B$, $E$, and $F$ can help in understanding the geometry.\n\n## Step 5: Utilize the properties of the right triangle $BEF$ and the fact that $BE = EF = FD$ to establish a relationship with the side length $x$.\nWe notice that $BE$, $EF$, and $FD$ form the sides of an isosceles right triangle when combined, where the hypotenuse would be the diagonal of the square, and each of these segments is a leg of a right triangle with half the square's side length. Since $BE = EF = FD = 30$, considering the diagonal of the square as the hypotenuse of a larger right triangle formed by these segments might be misleading without directly involving the side length $x$.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the right triangle that involves half of the square\u2019s side length and the segment $BE$ or $FD$.\nLet\u2019s consider the right triangle with hypotenuse $BE$ (or $FD$), one leg being half the side length of the square ($\\frac{x}{2}$), and the other leg being $x$. Applying the Pythagorean theorem here gives us $(\\frac{x}{2})^2 + x^2 = 30^2$. Simplifying, $\\frac{x^2}{4} + x^2 = 900$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve the equation for $x$.\nCombining like terms, $\\frac{5x^2}{4} = 900$. Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{4}{5}$ gives $x^2 = 720$. Therefore, $x = \\sqrt{720}$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the area of the square $ABCD$.\nThe area of a square is given by the formula $x^2$, where $x$ is the length of a side. Since we found $x^2 = 720$, this directly gives us the area.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{720}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe have a square $ABCD$ with points $E$ and $F$ on sides $AD$ and $BC$ respectively. The segments $BE$, $EF$, and $FD$ are all equal to $30$ units. Our task is to find the area of the square $ABCD$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key geometric properties\nThe segments $BE$, $EF$, and $FD$ divide the square into three equal horizontal sections. Let's denote the length of the side of the square as $x$. Since $BE = EF = FD = 30$, the length of each of the three sections is $x/3$ (except for the top and bottom sections which include the additional length from $E$ to $D$ and $B$ to $F$ but considering the equal division, the middle section's length is $x/3$).\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem\nTo find the length of the side of the square, we can use the Pythagorean theorem on the right-angled triangles formed by $BE$ and $EF$. We have a right triangle with hypotenuse $BE = 30$ and one leg being $x/3$ (since $E$ divides $AD$ in such a way that $AE$ and $ED$ are $x/3$ each if we were considering equal divisions for the segments $BE$, $BF$, and $FD$). However, we must consider the entire length $x$ in relation to these segments for accurate calculations.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate using the Pythagorean theorem\nConsidering the triangle $\\triangle BEF$, $BE = 30$, $EF = 30$, and if we draw a perpendicular from $E$ to $BC$ (let's call the intersection point $G$), we can see that $BG = x/3$ because $BE$ is the hypotenuse of $\\triangle BEG$. However, since $EF$ also equals $30$, and considering the segments created by drawing a line from $E$ to $BC$ and extending it to $F$, we actually should directly apply the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle formed by the line connecting $E$ and $F$ (which equals $30$), and the sides of the square.\n\n## Step 5: Apply correct geometric principles\nLet's reconsider our approach with the correct geometric principles. The segments $BE$, $EF$, and $FD$ create three right triangles when we draw lines from $E$ to $BC$ and from $F$ to $AD$. However, given $BE = EF = FD$, it indicates a specific geometric relationship that can help us find $x$.\n\n## Step 6: Correct approach with the Pythagorean theorem\nConsider $\\triangle ABE$, where $AB = x$ (side of the square), and $BE = 30$. However, to apply the Pythagorean theorem correctly, we must understand that $AE$ is a part of $AD$, and since $BE = EF = FD = 30$, it suggests that the square is divided in such a way that these segments create equal lengths on the sides they intersect.\n\n## Step 7: Re-evaluate the geometric setup\nGiven $BE = EF = FD = 30$, and considering the square's properties, the correct approach involves understanding the geometric and algebraic relationships between the segments and the square's side length.\n\n## Step 8: Utilize the given equalities\nThe given equalities $BE = EF = FD = 30$ imply a specific geometric configuration. Let's denote $AE = y$ and $AF = z$. However, given the square's symmetry and the equal lengths of $BE$, $EF$, and $FD$, we should consider how these equalities divide the square.\n\n## Step 9: Correct application of geometric principles\nConsider the right triangle formed by drawing a line from $E$ to $F$ (which is $30$) and the respective segments of the square it intersects. This triangle will help in applying the Pythagorean theorem correctly to find $x$.\n\n## Step 10: Solve for the side length\nTo find the area of the square, we first need to find the length of its side, $x$. Given the right triangle with $EF = 30$, and knowing that this triangle is part of the larger square, we apply geometric principles to find $x$. Since $BE = EF = FD$, and considering the square's structure, we can derive that $x^2 + (\\frac{x}{3})^2 = 30^2$ for the triangle involving $BE$ or $FD$, but considering $EF$ and its relation to the square's sides gives us a more direct path to $x$.\n\n## Step 11: Apply the correct formula\nGiven the triangle $\\triangle BEF$, where $BE = EF = 30$, and considering the square's properties, we have $x^2 + (\\frac{x}{3})^2 = 900$ for a triangle involving a side and a segment like $BE$ or $FD$, but for a direct calculation involving $EF$ and the sides of the square, we need to consider how $EF$ relates to $x$ directly.\n\n## Step 12: Solve the equation for x\nHowever, considering the setup and directly applying the Pythagorean theorem to relevant triangles, we find that $x^2 + x^2 = 30^2 + 30^2$ because $BE$ and $FD$ essentially create two right triangles with $EF$ when considering the full length of the sides of the square they intersect.\n\n## Step 13: Calculate x\nGiven $2x^2 = 30^2 + 30^2$, we simplify to $2x^2 = 1800$, and solving for $x$ gives $x^2 = 900$, hence $x = \\sqrt{900} = 30$.\n\n## Step 14: Calculate the area of the square\nThe area of a square is given by $x^2$, where $x$ is the length of a side. Since we found $x = 30\\sqrt{2}$ is incorrect based on the misinterpretation in steps, and correctly it should directly relate to how the segments divide the square and apply to its area, the actual calculation directly from correct principles should give us $x$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{810}$"
