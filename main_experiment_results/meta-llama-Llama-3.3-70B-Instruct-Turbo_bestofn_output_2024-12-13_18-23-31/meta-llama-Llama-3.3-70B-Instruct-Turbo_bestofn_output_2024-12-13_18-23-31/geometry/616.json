    "## Step 1: Understand the triangle inequality theorem\nThe triangle inequality theorem states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. This gives us three inequalities for a triangle with sides of length a, b, and c: a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the triangle inequality to the given problem\nGiven two sides of lengths 5 and 6 units, and the third side of length x units, we can write the inequalities as: 5 + 6 > x, 5 + x > 6, and 6 + x > 5. Simplifying these, we get: 11 > x, x > 1, and x > -1. Since x must be an integer and represents a length, it must be positive, making the relevant inequalities 11 > x and x > 1.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the range of x\nFrom the inequalities, x must be greater than 1 and less than 11. So, 1 < x < 11. Since x is an integer, the possible values of x range from 2 to 10.\n\n## Step 4: Find the largest possible perimeter\nThe perimeter (P) of the triangle is the sum of all its sides, given by P = 5 + 6 + x. To find the largest possible perimeter, we need to use the largest possible value of x, which is 10. Therefore, the largest possible perimeter is P = 5 + 6 + 10 = 21.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$",

The second inequality simplifies to x > 1, and the third to x > -1. Since x must be an integer and the length of a side cannot be negative, we consider x > 1 and x < 11.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the range of x considering integer values\nGiven x is an integer, the possible values for x range from 2 to 10, inclusive, because x has to be greater than 1 and less than 11.\n\n## Step 4: Find the largest possible perimeter\nThe perimeter (P) of a triangle is the sum of its side lengths, so P = 5 + 6 + x.

    "## Step 1: Understand the triangle inequality theorem\nThe triangle inequality theorem states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. In this case, with sides of length 5 and 6 units, and the third side of length $x$ units, we must have: $5 + 6 > x$, $5 + x > 6$, and $6 + x > 5$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the triangle inequality to find the range of $x$\nFrom $5 + 6 > x$, we get $11 > x$. From $5 + x > 6$, we get $x > 1$. From $6 + x > 5$, we get $x > -1$. Since $x$ must be an integer and the length of a side cannot be negative, we combine these inequalities to find that $x$ must satisfy $1 < x < 11$, and since $x$ is an integer, $2 \\leq x \\leq 10$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the largest possible perimeter\nThe perimeter $P$ of the triangle is given by $P = 5 + 6 + x = 11 + x$. To find the largest possible perimeter, we need to use the largest possible value of $x$ within the constraints found. The largest integer value of $x$ that satisfies the inequality is 10.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the largest possible perimeter\nSubstitute $x = 10$ into the perimeter formula: $P = 11 + 10 = 21$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$"

  "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",
