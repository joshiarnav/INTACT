    "## Step 1: Recall the Angle Bisector Theorem\nThe Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, an angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the lengths of the other two sides.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem to the given triangle\nGiven that the ratio $AC:CB$ is $3:4$, we can apply the Angle Bisector Theorem to $\\triangle ABC$. The theorem implies that the ratio of the lengths of the segments of side $AB$ (formed by intersecting the angle bisector of $\\angle ACB$) will also be $3:4$.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the exterior angle bisector\nHowever, the problem involves the bisector of the exterior angle at $C$, which intersects $BA$ extended at $P$. To handle this, we need to apply the Exterior Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the ratio of the lengths of the segments formed by the exterior angle bisector (intersecting the extension of the side) is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the Exterior Angle Bisector Theorem\nThe Exterior Angle Bisector Theorem tells us that $\\frac{PA}{AB} = \\frac{AC}{CB}$. Given that $\\frac{AC}{CB} = \\frac{3}{4}$, we can substitute to find $\\frac{PA}{AB}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the ratio $\\frac{PA}{AB}$\nSubstituting the given ratio $\\frac{AC}{CB} = \\frac{3}{4}$ into the equation from the Exterior Angle Bisector Theorem, we get $\\frac{PA}{AB} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the correct format for the answer\nThe ratio $\\frac{PA}{AB}$ is $\\frac{3}{4}$, which corresponds to option $\\boxed{3:4}$.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3:1}$",
    "## Step 1: Apply Angle Bisector Theorem to find the ratio of lengths of the segments that the angle bisector intersects.\nThe Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments on the third side that are formed by intersecting an angle bisector and the side is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle. This theorem applies to the interior angle bisector. For the exterior angle bisector, a similar relationship can be derived by considering the exterior angle bisector theorem, which states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments formed by the exterior angle bisector (extended side) is equal to the ratio of the other two sides of the triangle.\n\n## Step 2: Use the Exterior Angle Bisector Theorem to relate the ratio of segments PA and AB to the ratio of the sides of the triangle.\nGiven that the ratio $AC:CB$ is $3:4$, we can use the Exterior Angle Bisector Theorem to find the ratio $PA:AB$. According to the theorem, $PA:AB = AC:CB$ when considering the exterior angle bisector at $C$ intersecting the extension of $BA$. Therefore, $PA:AB = 3:4$.\n\n## Step 3: Correctly apply the ratio to the segments PA and AB.\nTo express the ratio $PA:AB$ correctly, we must consider the relationship given by the Exterior Angle Bisector Theorem and the fact! that $PA$ is the segment outside the triangle (on the extension of $AB$) and $AB$ is the segment inside the triangle. The theorem directly relates the ratio of the sides of the triangle to the ratio of these segments.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3:1}$",
    "## Step 1: Apply Angle Bisector Theorem to find the ratio of interest\nThe Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments on the third side that are formed by intersecting an angle bisector and the side is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle. This theorem applies to the interior angle bisector. However, for an exterior angle bisector, we can use a similar principle but with a consideration for the exterior angle property.\n\n\n## Step 2: Identify relevant theorem for exterior angle bisector\nFor the exterior angle bisector of a triangle, the ratio of the segments of the extended side (in this case, $PA$ and $AB$) is related to the ratio of the other two sides of the triangle. This relationship, however, is inverted when considering the exterior angle bisector compared to the interior angle bisector.\n\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Exterior Angle Bisector Theorem\nGiven that $AC:CB = 3:4$, we use the principle that the ratio $PA:AB$ will be the inverse of the ratio of the sides adjacent to the exterior angle bisector, which are $AC$ and $CB$. However, we need to consider the relationship in the context of exterior angle bisector theorem properly, which may directly relate to how the exterior angle bisector divides the opposite side in relation to the triangle's side lengths.\n\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the ratio $PA:AB$ based on the given information and theorem\nThe Exterior Angle Bisector Theorem, in a way similar to the Angle Bisector Theorem but considering the exterior angle, suggests that $PA:AB$ equals $AC:CB$ when considering the segments created by the intersection of the exterior angle bisector with the extension of the side. However, the direct application might need adjustment based on how the theorem specifically addresses exterior angles and extended segments.\n\n\n## Step 5: Correctly apply the theorem with the understanding of exterior angle properties\nGiven that the exterior angle bisector theorem might not directly give us the ratio $PA:AB$ from $AC:CB$ without considering the extended segment and the angle properties, let's correct the approach. The theorem actually implies that the ratio of $PA$ to $AB$ is related to the sides of the triangle but requires understanding that the exterior angle bisector creates segments related to the triangle's geometry.\n\n\n## Step 6: Finalize the calculation based on the correct understanding of the theorem\nTo find $PA:AB$, knowing $!AC:CB = 3:4$, and considering the properties of the exterior angle bisector intersecting the extended side, we use the fact that the ratio of segments formed by the exterior angle bisector is inversely related to the sides of the triangle. This means we look for a relationship that reflects how $PA$ and $AB$ are divided in relation to $AC$ and $CB$, but with the correct application of the exterior angle bisector theorem.\n\n\n## Step 7: Directly calculate $PA:AB$ using the corrected understanding\nGiven the misstep in direct application, recall that for the exterior angle bisector of $\\triangle ABC$ intersecting $BA$ extended at $P$, the ratio $PA:AB$ is actually actually related to $AC:CB$ but considering the exterior angle and its intersection with the extension of $AB$, the correct relationship to use is $PA:AB = AC:CB$ when considering the proportional segments created by the exterior angle bisector in relation to the sides of the triangle.\n\n\n## Step 8: Correct the final step with the accurate relationship\nThe ratio $PA:AB$ is equal to $AC:CB$ when applying the concept correctly to the exterior angle bisector and its intersection with the extended side of the triangle.

Draw $X$, where $X$ is on $BC$ and $AC \\parallel PX$. By AA Similarity, $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle PBX$, so $PX = 3an$, $BX = 4an$, and $CX = 4an - 4n$.\nAlso, let $\\angle ABC = a$ and $\\angle BAC = b$. Since the angles of a triangle add up to $180^{\\circ}$, $\\angle BCA = 180-a-b$. By Exterior Angle Theorem, $\\angle ACX = a+b$, and since $CP$ bisects $\\angle ACX$, $\\angle PCX = \\frac{a+b}{2}$.
