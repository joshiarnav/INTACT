    "## Step 1: To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the properties of an equilateral triangle and how it relates to the given graph of $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$.\nThe graph of $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$ is a parabola that opens downwards. Since triangle $ABO$ is equilateral, the length of $AO$ is equal to the length of $BO$, and both are equal to the length of $AB$.\n\n## Step 2: We can use the property of an equilateral triangle to find the length of one side.\nSince $AO = BO$, and $A$ and $B$ lie on the graph of $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, we can consider the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ to be $(x, -\\frac{1}{2}x^2)$ and $(-x, -\\frac{1}{2}x^2)$, respectively.\n\n## Step 3: Using the distance formula, we can find the length of $AO$ or $BO$.\nThe distance formula between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$. Applying this formula to find the length of $AO$, we have $\\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (-\\frac{1}{2}x^2-0)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4}$.\n\n## Step 4: Since triangle $ABO$ is equilateral, the length of $AB$ is equal to the length of $AO$.\nThe length of $AB$ can be found using the distance formula between points $A$ and $B$, which is $\\sqrt{(x-(-x))^2 + (-\\frac{1}{2}x^2-(-\\frac{1}{2}x^2))^2} = \\sqrt{(2x)^2 + 0} = \\sqrt{4x^2} = 2x$.\n\n## Step 5: Now we can equate the length of $AO$ (or $BO$) to the length of $AB$ to find the value of $x$.\nSetting $\\sqrt{x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4} = 2x$, we can solve for $x$.\n\n## Step 6: Squaring both sides of the equation $\\sqrt{x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4} = 2x$ gives $x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4 = 4x^2$.\nRearranging this equation, we get $\\frac{1}{4}x^4 - 3x^2 = 0$. Factoring out $x^2$, we have $x^2(\\frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3) = 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Solving the equation $x^2(\\frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3) = 0$ gives us two possible values for $x^2$: $x^2 = 0$ or $\\frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3 = 0$.\nSince $x^2 = 0$ would result in points $A$ and $B$ being at the origin, which does not form a triangle, we consider $\\frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3 = 0$. Solving for $x^2$, we get $\\frac{1}{4}x^2 = 3$, which gives $x^2 = 12$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find $x = \\pm \\sqrt{12}$, but since we are looking for a length, we consider the positive value $x = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n## Step 8: Finally, we can find the length of one side of triangle $ABO$ by substituting $x = 2\\sqrt{3}$ into the expression for the length of $AB$.\nThe length of $AB$ is $2x = 2(2\\sqrt{3}) = 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$",
    "## Step 1: To find the length of one side of triangle ABO, we first need to determine the coordinates of points A and B on the graph of y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2.\nThe equation of the graph is y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2. Since triangle ABO is equilateral, the distance between points A and B must be equal to the distance from point O to either point A or point B.\n\n## Step 2: The distance between two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) in a coordinate plane is given by the distance formula: d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}.\nIn this case, point O is at (0, 0), so the distance from O to A (or B) can be simplified as d = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.\n\n## Step 3: Since the triangle is equilateral, the length of each side is the same. Let's denote this length as s. Then, the distance from O to A (or B) is also s.\nWe know that the y-coordinate of points A and B is the same because they lie on the line y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2 and form an equilateral triangle with O. Thus, if point A is at (x, -\\frac{1}{2}x^2), point B must be at (-x, -\\frac{1}{2}x^2) due to symmetry about the y-axis.\n\n## Step 4: The distance between points A and B can be found using the distance formula. Since their y-coordinates are the same, the formula simplifies to d = \\sqrt{(x - (-x))^2 + (-\\frac{1}{2}x^2 - (-\\frac{1}{2}x^2))^2} = \\sqrt{(2x)^2} = 2x.\nGiven that triangle ABO is equilateral, this distance must also be equal to s.\n\n## Step 5: The distance from O to A (or B) is given by s = \\sqrt{x^2 + (-\\frac{1}{2}x^2)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4}.\nSince the triangle is equilateral, the distance between A and B, which is 2x, must equal the distance from O to A (or B), so we have 2x = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4}.\n\n## Step 6: Squaring both sides of the equation 2x = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4} gives 4x^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4.\nRearranging the terms results in \\frac{1}{4}x^4 - 3x^2 = 0.\n\n## Step 7: Factoring out x^2 from the equation \\frac{1}{4}x^4 - 3x^2 = 0 yields x^2(\\frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3) = 0.\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives two possible solutions: x^2 = 0 or \\frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3 = 0.\n\n## Step 8: The solution x^2 = 0 leads to x = 0, which corresponds to point O and does not give a valid side length for the triangle.\nSolving \\frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3 = 0 for x^2 gives \\frac{1}{4}x^2 = 3, and then x^2 = 12.\n\n## Step 9: Taking the square root of x^2 = 12 gives x = \\pm\\sqrt{12} = \\pm2\\sqrt{3}.\nSince the distance between A and B is 2x and x must be positive to give a valid length, we use x = 2\\sqrt{3}.\n\n## Step 10: The length of one side of triangle ABO is thus 2x = 2(2\\sqrt{3}) = 4\\sqrt{3}.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$",

  "solution": "Let the coordinates of $A$ be $(a_1,a_2)$. Then since $A$ is on the graph of $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, we know that $a_2 = -\\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$. We can also use our knowledge of special right triangles to write $a_2$ in terms of $a_1$. Let $C$ be the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ and let $O$ be the origin. Then $OCA$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, so the ratio of the length of $OC$ to the length of $CA$ is $\\sqrt{3}:1$. Now the coordinates of C are $(0, a_2)$, so the length of $OC$ is just $-a_2$ (since $a_2$ is negative) and the length of $CA$ is $a_1$. This means $\\dfrac{-a_2}{a_1}=\\sqrt{3} \\Longrightarrow a_2=-\\sqrt{3}a_1$.\n\nWe can now set our two equations for $a_2$ equal to each other and get $-\\sqrt{3}a_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$. Multiplying both sides by $-\\frac{2}{a_1}$ immediately gives $a_1=2\\sqrt{3}$. From here we could solve for $a_2$ using one of our equations and then use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the side length of the equilateral triangle, but there's a better way. We remember that the hypotenuse of our special triangle is twice as long as the shortest side of it, which has length $a_1=2\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore our answer is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$.",
