    "## Step 1: Find the y-coordinates of points A and B\nFirst, we need to find the y-coordinates of points A and B. Since $y = \\ln x$, we have $y_1 = \\ln x_1 = \\ln 1 = 0$ and $y_2 = \\ln x_2 = \\ln 1000$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the y-coordinate of point C\nSince points C and D trisect $\\overline{AB}$, with $AC < CB$, point C is one-third of the way from point A to point B. Therefore, the y-coordinate of point C is $y_C = y_1 + \\frac{1}{3}(y_2 - y_1) = 0 + \\frac{1}{3}(\\ln 1000 - 0) = \\frac{1}{3}\\ln 1000$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the x-coordinate of point E\nSince point E has the same y-coordinate as point C, we have $y_3 = y_C = \\frac{1}{3}\\ln 1000$. We also know that $y_3 = \\ln x_3$. Therefore, $\\ln x_3 = \\frac{1}{3}\\ln 1000$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for x_3\nTo solve for $x_3$, we can exponentiate both sides of the equation: $x_3 = e^{\\frac{1}{3}\\ln 1000}$. Using the property of logarithms that $\\ln a^b = b\\ln a$, we can rewrite this as $x_3 = e^{\\ln (1000^{\\frac{1}{3}})} = 1000^{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\sqrt[3]{1000} = 10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",
    "## Step 1: To find the coordinates of point C, which trisects segment AB, we first need to determine the coordinates of points A and B.\nGiven that $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 1000$, and the function is $f(x) = \\ln x$, we can find $y_1$ and $y_2$ by substituting $x_1$ and $x_2$ into the function. So, $y_1 = \\ln(1) = 0$ and $y_2 = \\ln(1000)$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the value of $y_2$.\n$y_2 = \\ln(1000) = \\ln(10^3) = 3\\ln(10)$, because of the logarithm property $\\ln(a^b) = b\\ln(a)$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the coordinates of point C, which is one of the trisecting points of segment AB, closer to A.\nThe trisecting points divide the segment into three equal parts.

    "## Step 1: Find the y-coordinates of points A and B\nTo find the y-coordinates of points A and B, we use the function $f(x) = \\ln x$. For point A, $y_1 = \\ln(x_1) = \\ln(1) = 0$. For point B, $y_2 = \\ln(x_2) = \\ln(1000)$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the y-coordinate of point C\nSince points C and D trisect $\\overline{AB}$, with $AC < CB$, point C is located at one-third of the distance from A to B. The y-coordinate of point C can be found using the formula $y_C = y_1 + \\frac{1}{3}(y_2 - y_1)$.

Since $1000 = 10^3$, $\\ln(1000) = \\ln(10^3) = 3\\ln(10)$.

  "solution": "Since $C$ is the trisector of line segment $\\overline{AB}$ closer to $A$, the $y$-coordinate of $C$ is equal to two thirds the $y$-coordinate of $A$ plus one third the $y$-coordinate of $B$. Thus, point $C$ has coordinates $(x_0, \\frac{2}{3} \\ln 1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\ln 1000) = (x_0, \\ln 10)$ for some $x_0$. Then the horizontal line through $C$ has equation $y = \\ln 10$, and this intersects the curve $y = \\ln x$ at the point $(10, \\ln 10)$, so $x_3 = \\boxed{10}$.",
