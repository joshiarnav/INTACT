    "## Step 1:  To find $\\cos C$ in the given right triangle, we first need to understand what $\\cos C$ represents.\n## Step 2:  In a right-angled triangle, the cosine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.\n## Step 3:  Looking at the triangle, we see that the side adjacent to angle $C$ is $AC$, and the hypotenuse is $BC$.\n## Step 4:  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of side $AC$. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n## Step 5:  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $AC = \\sqrt{BC^2 - AB^2}$, where $AB = 6$ and $BC = 10$.\n## Step 6:  Substituting these values into the formula, we get $AC = \\sqrt{10^2 - 6^2} = \\sqrt{100 - 36} = \\sqrt{64} = 8$.\n## Step 7:  Now that we know the lengths of $AC$ and $BC$, we can find $\\cos C$ using the formula $\\cos C = \\frac{AC}{BC}$.\n## Step 8:  Plugging in the values, we get $\\cos C = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, $\\cos C = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$",
