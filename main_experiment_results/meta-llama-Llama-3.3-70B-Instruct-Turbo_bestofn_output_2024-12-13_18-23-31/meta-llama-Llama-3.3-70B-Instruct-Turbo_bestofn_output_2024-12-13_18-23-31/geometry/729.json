    "## Step 1: Calculate the radius of the cylinder when 8-inch sides are taped together\nWhen the 8-inch sides are taped together, the circumference of the base of the cylinder is 8 inches. The formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = 2\\pi r$, where $C$ is the circumference and $r$ is the radius. So, $8 = 2\\pi r$, which implies $r = \\frac{8}{2\\pi} = \\frac{4}{\\pi}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the volume of the cylinder when 8-inch sides are taped together\nThe height of the cylinder is 6 inches (the other dimension of the paper). The formula for the volume of a cylinder is $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $V$ is the volume, $r$ is the radius, and $h$ is the height. Substituting the values, we get $V_1 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^2 6 = \\pi \\frac{16}{\\pi^2} 6 = \\frac{96}{\\pi}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the radius of the cylinder when 6-inch sides are taped together\nWhen the 6-inch sides are taped together, the circumference of the base of the cylinder is 6 inches. Using the same formula as before, $6 = 2\\pi r$, which implies $r = \\frac{6}{2\\pi} = \\frac{3}{\\pi}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the volume of the cylinder when 6-inch sides are taped together\nThe height of this cylinder is 8 inches. Substituting the values into the volume formula, we get $V_2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{3}{\\pi}\\right)^2 8 = \\pi \\frac{9}{\\pi^2} 8 = \\frac{72}{\\pi}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes\nThe positive difference between the volumes is $|V_1 - V_2| = \\left|\\frac{96}{\\pi} - \\frac{72}{\\pi}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{24}{\\pi}\\right| = \\frac{24}{\\pi}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $\\pi$ times the positive difference of the volumes\nMultiplying the difference by $\\pi$, we get $\\pi \\times \\frac{24}{\\pi} = 24$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$",

  "solution": "Amy's cylinder has a height of 8 and a base circumference of 6.
