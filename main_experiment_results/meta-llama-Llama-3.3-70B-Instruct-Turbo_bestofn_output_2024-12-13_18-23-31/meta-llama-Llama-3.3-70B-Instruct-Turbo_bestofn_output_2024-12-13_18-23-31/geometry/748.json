    "## Step 1: Recall the formula for the circumference of a circle\nThe circumference $C$ of a circle is given by the formula $C = 2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. We're given that the circumference of circle $A$ is 60 feet.\n\n## Step 2: Use the given circumference to find the radius of the circle\nGiven $C = 60$ feet, we can solve for $r$ using the formula $C = 2\\pi r$. Thus, $60 = 2\\pi r$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \\frac{60}{2\\pi} = \\frac{30}{\\pi}$ feet.\n\n## Step 3: Understand the relationship between the central angle and the arc length\nThe length of an arc $\\widehat{BC}$ on a circle is directly proportional to the central angle $\\theta$ (in radians) subtended by the arc and the radius $r$ of the circle. The formula for the arc length $L$ is given by $L = r\\theta$.\n\n## Step 4: Convert the given central angle from degrees to radians\nThe central angle given is $60^{\\circ}$. To convert degrees to radians, we multiply by $\\frac{\\pi}{180}$. Thus, $60^{\\circ} = 60 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ radians.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the length of the arc $\\widehat{BC}$\nUsing the formula $L = r\\theta$ and substituting the values of $r = \\frac{30}{\\pi}$ and $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, we find $L = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{3} = 10$ feet.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
