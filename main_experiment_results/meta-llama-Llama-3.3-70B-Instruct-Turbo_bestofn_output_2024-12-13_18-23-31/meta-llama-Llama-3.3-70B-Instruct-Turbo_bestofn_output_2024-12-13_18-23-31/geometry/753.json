    "## Step 1: Understand the triangle inequality theorem\nThe triangle inequality theorem states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. This gives us the conditions to form a valid triangle.\n\n## Step 2: List all possible combinations of integral side lengths that sum to 7\nGiven that the perimeter of the triangle is 7 units and each side must have integral length, we list all combinations of three integers that sum to 7. These combinations are: (1, 1, 5), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 3), and (2, 2, 3).\n\n## Step 3: Apply the triangle inequality to eliminate invalid combinations\nFor each combination from step 2, we apply the triangle inequality theorem:\n- (1, 1, 5): 1 + 1 < 5, so this combination does not form a valid triangle.\n- (1, 2, 4): 1 + 2 < 4, so this combination does not form a valid triangle.\n- (1, 3, 3): 1 + 3 > 3, 3 + 3 > 1, and 1 + 3 > 3, so this combination forms a valid triangle.\n- (2, 2, 3): 2 + 2 > 3, 2 + 3 > 2, and 2 + 3 > 2, so this combination forms a valid triangle.\n\n## Step 4: Count the valid combinations\nFrom step 3, we identified 2 valid combinations that can form different triangles with integral side lengths and a perimeter of 7 units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

  "solution": "Let $a,b,$ and $c$ represent the three side lengths of the triangle. The perimeter is $a+b+c=7,$ so $b+c=7-a$. We know by the Triangle Inequality that the sum of two side lengths of a triangle must be greater than the third side length. If we focus on the variable $a$, we have\n\\[b+c>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 7-a>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 3.5>a.\\]We could easily replace $a$ with $b$ or $c$, so the maximum length of any of the three sides is $3$. If $a=3$, then $b+c=4$ and $b$ and $c$ could be $1$ and $3$ in some order or $2$ and $2$ in some order. If we let $a=2$ or $a=1$ and the maximum side length is $3$, we'll still end up with triangles of side lengths $(1,3,3)$ or $(2,2,3)$. There are $\\boxed{2}$ different triangles.",
