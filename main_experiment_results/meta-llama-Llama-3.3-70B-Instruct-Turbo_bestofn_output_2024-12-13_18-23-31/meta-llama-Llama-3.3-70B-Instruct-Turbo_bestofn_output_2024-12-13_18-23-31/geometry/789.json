    "## Step 1: We are given that triangles $ABC$ and $BCD$ are equilateral triangles.\nThis means all their sides are of equal length. Let's denote the length of the sides as $s$.\n\n## Step 2: To find the value of $AD \\div BC$, we first need to determine the lengths of $AD$ and $BC$.\nSince $BC$ is a side of an equilateral triangle, its length is $s$. Now, we need to find the length of $AD$.\n\n## Step 3: Notice that $AD$ consists of the altitudes from $A$ and $D$ to $BC$.\nIn an equilateral triangle, the altitude is $\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}!$. Since $AD$ is made up of two such altitudes, its length is $s\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n## Step 4: Now, we can find the value of $AD \\div BC$ by dividing the length of $AD$ by the length of $BC$.\nSo, $AD \\div BC = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{s}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression $\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{s}$.\nThe $s$ terms cancel out, leaving us with $\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify key properties of the figure\nThe figure consists of two equilateral triangles, $ABC$ and $BCD$. Since both triangles are equilateral, all their sides are equal in length. Let's denote the length of the sides of the equilateral triangles as $s$. Therefore, $AB = BC = CA = s$ and $BD = CD = CB = s$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the relationship between AD and BC\nTo find the relationship between $AD$ and $BC$, we need to consider the properties of the equilateral triangles and how $AD$ is related to $BC$. Given that $ABC$ and $BCD$ are equilateral, the length of $AD$ can be determined by considering the altitude of an equilateral triangle.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the altitude of an equilateral triangle\nThe altitude $h$ of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using the formula $h = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, where $s$ is the length of a side of the equilateral triangle.\n\n## Step 4: Find the length of AD\nSince $AD$ consists of the altitudes from $A$ and $D$ to $BC$, its length is twice the altitude of one equilateral triangle.

    "## Step 1: To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of the given figure, which consists of two equilateral triangles $ABC$ and $BCD$.\nGiven that triangles $ABC$ and $BCD$ are equilateral, all their sides are of equal length. Let's denote the length of the sides as $s$. Therefore, $AB = BC = CA = s$ and $BD = CD = DB = s$.\n\n## Step 2: Since the triangles are equilateral, the height of each triangle can be calculated using the formula $h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a$, where $a$ is the length of a side of the equilateral triangle.\nFor triangle $ABC$, the height $AH = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s$, where $H$ is the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$.
