    "## Step 1: First, let's analyze the given triangle ABC.\nTriangle $ABC$ is a right-angled triangle with $\\angle C = 90^\\circ$, $AC = 6$, and $BC = 8$. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $AB$. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of AB.\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem, $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100$. Therefore, $AB = \\sqrt{100} = 10$.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the similarity of triangles DBE and ABC.\nTriangles $DBE$ and $ABC$ are similar because they share the same angle at $B$ and both have a right angle. Therefore, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.\n\n## Step 4: Establish the ratio of corresponding sides in triangles DBE and ABC.\nThe ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal. So, $BD/BA = DE/AC$. We know $DE = 4$ and $AC = 6$. We need to find $BD$, and we already know $BA = 10$ from Step 2.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for BD using the ratio of corresponding sides.\nFrom the established ratio $BD/BA = DE/AC$, we substitute the known values to get $BD/10 = 4/6$. Simplifying this equation gives $BD = (4/6) * 10$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the value of BD.\n$BD = (4/6) * 10 = (2/3) * 10 = 20/3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{20}{3}}$",
    "## Step 1: Given information\nWe are given a right-angled triangle $ABC$ with $\\angle C = 90^\\circ$, $AC = 6$, and $BC = 8$. Points $D$ and $E$ are on $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{BC}$, respectively, with $\\angle BED = 90^\\circ$ and $DE = 4$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Pythagorean Theorem to triangle $ABC$\nFirst, let's find the length of $AB$. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2$. Substituting the given values, $AB^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100$. Therefore, $AB = \\sqrt{100} = 10$.\n\n## Step 3: Similarity between triangles $DBE$ and $ABC$\nSince $\\angle BED = 90^\\circ$ and $\\angle B$ is common to both triangles $DBE$ and $ABC$, these triangles are similar by Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion.\n\n## Step 4: Use similarity to set up a proportion\nBecause the triangles are similar, the corresponding sides are in proportion. Specifically, $\\frac{BD}{BA}=\\frac{DE}{AC}$. Substituting the known lengths, $\\frac{BD}{10}=\\frac{4}{6}$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the proportion for $BD$\nTo find $BD$, cross multiply the proportion to get $6BD = 4 \\times 10$. This simplifies to $6BD = 40$. Dividing both sides by 6 gives $BD = \\frac{40}{6}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the fraction\n$BD = \\frac{40}{6}$ can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. Thus, $BD = \\frac{20}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{20}{3}}$"
