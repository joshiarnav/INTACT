    "## Step 1:  First, let's understand the given diagram and the information provided. We have a triangle $RQS$ where $P$ is a point on $RS$ such that $QP$ bisects $\\angle SQR$. This means that $\\angle PQS = \\angle PQR = x^\\circ$. Additionally, we know that $PQ = PR$, and $\\angle RSQ = 2y^\\circ$.\n## Step 2:  Since $RPS$ is a straight line, we can conclude that $\\angle SPQ = 180^\\circ - \\angle RPQ = 180^\\circ - 3y^\\circ$. Now, let's consider the triangle $\\triangle PQS$. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\\circ$, so we can write the equation $x^\\circ+2y^\\circ + (180^\\circ - 3y^\\circ) = 180^\\circ$.\n## Step 3:  Simplifying this equation gives us $x-y+180 = 180$, which reduces to $x=y$. This relationship between $x$ and $y$ will be helpful in further calculations.\n## Step 4:  Now, let's focus on the triangle $\\triangle RQP$. Since $QP=RP$, we have an isosceles triangle, and the base angles are equal. Therefore, $\\angle PQR = \\angle PRQ = x^\\circ$. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\\circ$, so we can write another equation: $x^\\circ+3y^\\circ+x^\\circ=180^\\circ$.\n## Step 5:  Substituting $x=y$ into this equation gives us $y+3y+y=180$, which simplifies to $5y=180$. Solving for $y$ yields $y=36$.\n## Step 6:  Finally, we need to find the measure of $\\angle RPQ$, which is $3y^\\circ$. Substituting the value of $y$, we get $3 \\times 36 = 108$ degrees.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the measure of $\\angle RPQ$ is $\\boxed{108}$ degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{108}$",
    "## Step 1: Given information\nWe are given a diagram where $P$ is on $RS$ such that $QP$ bisects $\\angle SQR$. It's also given that $PQ=PR$, $\\angle RSQ=2y^\\circ$, and $\\angle RPQ=3y^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 2: Find the measure of $\\angle RQS$\nSince $QP$ bisects $\\angle SQR$, we know that $\\angle RQS = \\angle PQS = x^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the measure of $\\angle RQP$\nAs $PQ = PR$, we have that $\\triangle PQR$ is isosceles. Therefore, $\\angle RQP = \\angle QRP = x^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the measure of $\\angle QRP$\nWe already know that $\\angle QRP = x^\\circ$ from the previous step.\n\n## Step 5: Use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$\nIn $\\triangle RQS$, we have $\\angle RQS + \\angle QRS + \\angle RSQ = 180^\\circ$. Substituting the known values, we get $x^\\circ + (180^\\circ - 3y^\\circ - x^\\circ) + 2y^\\circ = 180^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $x$ in terms of $y$\nFrom the equation in Step 5, we can simplify to find $x$ in terms of $y$. However, we actually need to find the measure of $\\angle RPQ$, which is $3y^\\circ$. So, we should focus on finding $y$.\n\n## Step 7: Find the measure of $\\angle RPQ$ using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$\nIn $\\triangle PQR$, we have $\\angle RPQ + \\angle PQR + \\angle QRP = 180^\\circ$. Substituting the known values, we get $3y^\\circ + x^\\circ + x^\\circ = 180^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 8: Use the information that $QP$ bisects $\\angle SQR$ to relate $x$ and $y$\nSince $QP$ bisects $\\angle SQR$, we know that $\\angle RQS = \\angle PQS = x^\\circ$. Also, $\\angle RSQ = 2y^\\circ$, so $\\angle SQR = 2x^\\circ = 180^\\circ - 2y^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for $y$\nFrom the information given and the fact that $\\angle RQS = x^\\circ$, we can deduce that $2x^\\circ = 180^\\circ - 2y^\\circ$. Since $\\angle RPQ = 3y^\\circ$, we need to find $y$. Using the equation from Step 7 and the relation between $x$ and $y$, we can solve for $y$.\n\n## Step 10: Solve the equation to find $y$\nWe have $2x^\\circ = 180^\\circ - 2y^\\circ$, which implies $x^\\circ = 90^\\circ - y^\\circ$. Substituting into the equation from Step 7, $3y^\\circ + (90^\\circ - y^\\circ) + (90^\\circ - y^\\circ) = 180^\\circ$. Simplifying, $3y^\\circ + 180^\\circ - 2y^\\circ = 180^\\circ$, which gives $y^\\circ = 36^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 11: Find the measure of $\\angle RPQ$\nNow that we know $y = 36^\\circ$, we can find the measure of $\\angle RPQ$, which is $3y^\\circ = 3 \\times 36^\\circ = 108^\\circ$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{108}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given diagram and problem statement\nWe are given a diagram where $P$ is a point on line segment $RS$, and $QP$ bisects $\\angle SQR$. Additionally, it's given that $PQ = PR$, $\\angle RSQ = 2y^\\circ$, and $\\angle RPQ = 3y^\\circ$. Our goal is to find the measure of $\\angle RPQ$ in degrees.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the relationship between angles given that $QP$ bisects $\\angle SQR$\nSince $QP$ bisects $\\angle SQR$, this means that $\\angle RQP = \\angle PQS = x^\\circ$. As $PQ = PR$, we also know that $\\triangle PQR$ is isosceles, so $\\angle RQP = \\angle QRP = x^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Angle Sum Property in $\\triangle RQP$\nThe sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\\circ$, so we can write the equation: $x^\\circ + x^\\circ + 3y^\\circ = 180^\\circ$. This simplifies to $2x + 3y = 180$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the information about $\\angle RSQ$ to find another equation\nWe're told that $\\angle RSQ = 2y^\\circ$. Since $\\angle RQS = 2x^\\circ$ (as $QP$ bisects $\\angle SQR$), and the sum of angles on a straight line is $180^\\circ$, we have $2x + 2y = 180$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the system of equations to find $y$\nNow, we have two equations: $2x + 3y = 180$ and $2x + 2y = 180$. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us $y = 180 - 180 = 0$. However, this approach doesn't seem right as it would imply all angles are $0^\\circ$, which doesn't make sense in this context. Let's correct the approach by directly solving for $y$ using the fact that $\\angle RPQ = 3y^\\circ$ and the properties of the triangle.\n\n## Step 6: Correct the mistake by focusing on the relationship between $x$ and $y$\nSince $\\angle RQP = x^\\circ$ and $\\angle PQS = x^\\circ$, and given that $\\angle RSQ = 2y^\\circ$, we need to consider the angles in $\\triangle RQS$ to find a correct relationship between $x$ and $y$. Knowing that $QP$ bisects $\\angle SQR$ and $PQ = PR$, we should look into how these conditions affect the angles, particularly focusing on $\\angle RPQ = 3y^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the correct relationship to solve for $y$\nRecognizing the mistake in the previous steps, let's directly use the given information that $\\angle RPQ = 3y^\\circ$ and the fact that the sum of angles in $\\triangle RQP$ must be $180^\\circ$. Given that $\\angle RQP = \\angle QRP$ due to the isosceles nature of $\\triangle PQR$, and knowing $\\angle RQS = 2x$, we need an equation that relates these angles to $y$ correctly.\n\n## Step 8: Re-evaluate the equation $2x + 2y = 180$ and its implications\nGiven that $\\angle RSQ = 2y^\\circ$ and $QP$ bisects $\\angle SQR$, implying $\\angle RQS = 2x^\\circ$, we should consider how these angles relate to the full circle and the properties of triangles to find $y$.\n\n## Step 9: Use the isosceles triangle properties and angle bisector correctly\nIn an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Since $PQ = PR$, $\\angle PQR = \\angle PRQ = x^\\circ$. Given that $QP$ bisects $\\angle SQR$, we know $\\angle RQP = x^\\circ$. Since $\\angle RPQ = 3y^\\circ$, using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we can relate $x$ and $y$.\n\n## Step 10: Solve for $y$ using the correct relationships and angle sums\nGiven that $\\angle RPQ = 3y^\\circ$ and the triangle's angle sum is $180^\\circ$, and knowing that $\\angle RQS = 2x$, we need to correctly apply these relationships to solve for $y$. Since $2x + 3y = 180$ and considering the properties of the triangle and the bisector, we aim to find the value of $y$.\n\n## Step 11: Final calculation for $y$\nGiven the equation $2x + 2y = 180$ from the straight line and knowing that in $\\triangle RQP$, $2x + 3y = 180$, we see that the difference between these equations gives us $y$. However, recognizing that we need to directly calculate $y$ based on given conditions without incorrect assumptions is crucial.\n\n## Step 12: Apply the exterior angle theorem\nConsidering $\\triangle RQP$, $\\angle RSQ$ is an exterior angle, so $\\angle RSQ = \\angle RQP + \\angle RPQ$. Given that $\\angle RSQ = 2y^\\circ$ and $\\angle RPQ = 3y^\\circ$, and knowing $\\angle RQP = x^\\circ$, we can relate these to find $y$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$"

Substituting into the equation from Step 7, $3y^\\circ + (90^\\circ - y^\\circ) + (90^\\circ - y^\\circ) = 180^\\circ$.
