    "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and the conditions.\nThe problem presents a square sheet of paper with an area of $6 \\text{ cm}^2$, where one side is white and the other is black. When folded so that point $A$ rests on the diagonal, the visible black area equals the visible white area. We need to find the distance of point $A$ from its original position after the fold.\n\n## Step 2: Denote variables for easier calculation.\nLet $x$ be the length of a leg of the black isosceles triangle formed after the fold. The area of the black triangle is then given by $\\frac{1}{2}(x)(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, and the area of the white portion is $6-x^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the given conditions.\nSince the visible black area is equal to the visible white area, we can equate the two expressions: $\\frac{1}{2}x^2=6-x^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for $x$.\nRearranging the equation gives us $\\frac{3}{2}x^2=6$, and solving for $x$ yields $x^2=4$, which means $x=2$. This is the length of the leg of the black triangle.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the distance from $A$ to its original position.\nThe distance from $A$ to its original position can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, where the distance is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length $x$. Thus, the distance is $\\sqrt{x^2+x^2}=\\sqrt{2x^2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute $x$ into the distance formula and simplify.\nSubstituting $x=2$ into the distance formula gives us $\\sqrt{2 \\cdot 2^2} = \\sqrt{8}$. Simplifying $\\sqrt{8}$ yields $2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$",

We need to find how many centimeters $A$ is from its original position after folding.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the side length of the square sheet\nGiven that the area of the square sheet is $6 \\text{ cm}^2$, we can calculate the side length of the square by taking the square root of the area. So, the side length $s$ is $\\sqrt{6}$ cm.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the geometry after folding\nWhen the sheet is folded along the diagonal, the black area forms a triangle, and the white area forms a quadrilateral (which can be further divided into two triangles and a square). The total black area is equal to the total white area. Let $x$ be the length of a leg of the black triangle. The area of the black triangle is then $\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, and the area of the white portion is $6 - x^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Set up the equation based on the given conditions\nSince the visible black area is equal to the visible white area, we have $\\frac{1}{2}x^2 = 6 - x^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the equation for $x$\nTo find $x$, we need to solve the equation $\\frac{1}{2}x^2 = 6 - x^2$. Rearranging terms, we get $\\frac{3}{2}x^2 = 6$. Dividing both sides by $\\frac{3}{2}$ gives $x^2 = 4$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x = 2$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the distance from $A$ to its original position\nThe distance from $A$ to its original position is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length $x$. Since $x = 2$, using the Pythagorean theorem, the distance $d$ is $d = \\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$",
