    "## Step 1: Understand the given figure and problem\nThe figure shows a rectangle $ABCD$ with $AB=12$ units, and $AZ=WC=6$ units. The area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is given as 120 square units. We are asked to find the area of triangle $BQW$.\n\n## Step 2: Find the length of CD\nSince $ABCD$ is a rectangle, $CD=AB=12$ units.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the height of the trapezoid ZWCD\nThe height of the trapezoid $ZWCD$ is the same as the height of the rectangle $ABCD$, which is $CD=12$ units.\n\n## Step 4: Use the area formula of the trapezoid to find the length of ZD and WC\nThe formula for the area of a trapezoid is $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the parallel sides, and $h$ is the height. For trapezoid $ZWCD$, $b_1 = ZD$, $b_2 = WC$, and $h = CD = 12$. Given that $AZ = WC = 6$, and the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is 120 square units, we can set up an equation: $\\frac{1}{2}(ZD + WC) \\times 12 = 120$. Since $WC = 6$, we have $\\frac{1}{2}(ZD + 6) \\times 12 = 120$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for ZD\nFrom the equation $\\frac{1}{2}(ZD + 6) \\times 12 = 120$, simplifying gives $(ZD + 6) \\times 6 = 120$. Therefore, $ZD + 6 = 20$, so $ZD = 14$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the length of QW\nSince $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$, $QW = \\frac{1}{2}ZW$. Given that $ZW = ZD - WD = ZD - (CD - WC) = 14 - (12 - 6) = 8$, $QW = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 = 4$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the area of triangle BQW\nTo find the area of triangle $BQW$, we need the base and the height. The base $QW = 4$. The height can be found using the length of $AB$ and $AZ$. Since $AZ = 6$, $BZ = AB - AZ = 12 - 6 = 6$. Because $ZW$ is parallel to $AB$, the height of triangle $BQW$ is the same as $BZ$, which is 6 units.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the area formula for the triangle BQW\nUsing the formula for the area of a triangle $A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height, we can calculate the area of triangle $BQW$ as $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 6 = 12$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
    "## Step 1: First, let's analyze the given figure and problem statement.\nWe have a rectangle $ABCD$ with $AZ=WC=6$ units and $AB=12$ units. The area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is given as 120 square units. We need to find the area of triangle $BQW$.\n\n## Step 2: To start, we should find the length of the base of the trapezoid, which is $CD$.\nSince $ABCD$ is a rectangle, $CD$ is equal to $AB$, which is given as 12 units.\n\n## Step 3: Next, let's determine the height of the trapezoid $ZWCD$.\nThe height of the trapezoid can be found by calculating the length of $ZD$. Since $AZ = 6$ units and $AD = 20$ units (as $AB = 12$ units and $AZ = 6$ units, $AD$ can be found using the Pythagorean theorem), we can find $ZD$ by subtracting $AZ$ from $AD$, giving us $ZD = 20 - 6 = 14$ units.\n\n## Step 4: Now, let's use the formula for the area of a trapezoid to set up an equation and solve for $ZW$.\nThe area of a trapezoid is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases and $h$ is the height. Substituting the given values, we get $120 = \\frac{1}{2}(ZW + CD) \\times 14$. Since $CD = 12$ units, we have $120 = \\frac{1}{2}(ZW + 12) \\times 14$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the equation for $ZW$.\nBy rearranging the equation, we can find $ZW$. $120 = \\frac{1}{2}(ZW + 12) \\times 14$ implies $240 = 14(ZW + 12)$, which further implies $ZW + 12 = \\frac{240}{14} = \\frac{120}{7}$. Therefore, $ZW = \\frac{120}{7} - 12 = \\frac{120 - 84}{7} = \\frac{36}{7}$.\n\n## Step 6: Since $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$, $ZQ = QW = \\frac{1}{2}ZW = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{36}{7} = \\frac{18}{7}$ units.\nNow that we have the length of $QW$, we need to find the height of triangle $BQW$ to calculate its area.\n\n## Step 7: To find the height of triangle $BQW$, we need to drop a perpendicular from $Q$ to $AB$ and denote the intersection point as $P$.\nSince $ABCD$ is a rectangle, $P$ will be the midpoint of $AB$. The length of $BP$ can be calculated as $BP = \\frac{1}{2}AB = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6$ units.\n\n## Step 8: Now we can find the height of triangle $BQW$, which is $QP$.\nThe height $QP$ can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. Since $QW = \\frac{18}{7}$ units and $WP = 6 - \\frac{18}{7} = \\frac{12}{7}$ units, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle $QPW$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate $QP$.\nHowever, we can see that $QP$ can also be found by determining the length of $AQ$ and then using $AQ$ and $AP$ to find $QP$. Since $AZ = 6$ units and $ZD = 14$ units, $AD = 20$ units. The length of $AQ$ can be calculated using the similar triangles $AZD$ and $AQC$. As $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$, the ratio of $AQ$ to $AD$ is the same as the ratio of $ZQ$ to $ZD$. Therefore, $\\frac{AQ}{AD} = \\frac{ZQ}{ZD}$, which implies $\\frac{AQ}{20} = \\frac{\\frac{18}{7}}{14}$.\n\n## Step 10: Solve for $AQ$.\n$\\frac{AQ}{20} = \\frac{\\frac{18}{7}}{14}$ implies $AQ = \\frac{\\frac{18}{7} \\times 20}{14} = \\frac{360}{98} = \\frac{180}{49}$ units.\n\n## Step 11: Find $QP$ using $AQ$ and $AP$.\nSince $AP = 6$ units and $AB = 12$ units, $QP = AQ - AP = \\frac{180}{49} - 6 = \\frac{180 - 294}{49} = \\frac{-114}{49}$ units. However, we made an error in the signs; let's correct that and simplify the calculation of $QP$ by directly using the properties of the rectangle and the known lengths.\n\n## Step 12: Correct the approach for finding the height of triangle $BQW$.\nWe should instead use the similar triangles $ZQC$ and $ZWD$. As $ZQ = \\frac{18}{7}$ units and $ZW = \\frac{36}{7}$ units, the ratio of $ZQ$ to $ZW$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$. This same ratio applies to the sides of the similar triangles, allowing us to find the height of triangle $BQW$. However, the key insight here is recognizing that we can use the area of the trapezoid and the known lengths to find the area of triangle $BQW$ directly.\n\n## Step 13: Calculate the area of triangle $BQW$.\nSince the area of the trapezoid $ZWCD$ is 120 square units, and the area of the rectangle $ABCD$ is $12 \\times 20 = 240$ square units, the area of triangle $AZD$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 20 = 60$ square units. The area of triangle $BQC$ can be found by subtracting the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ and triangle $AZD$ from the area of rectangle $ABCD$, and then subtracting the area of triangle $BQW$ from triangle $BWC$. Alternatively, we can directly find the area of triangle $BQW$ using the base and height.\n\n## Step 14: Final calculation for the area of triangle $BQW$.\nHowever, we made the calculation more complicated than necessary. Let's simplify: since $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$, the area of triangle $BQW$ is half the area of triangle $BZW$. The area of triangle $BZW$ can be found using the base $BW = 6$ units and the height, which is the same as the height of the rectangle, 20 units, but considering the part above the trapezoid. The area of triangle $BZW$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 14 = 42$ square units because $ZD = 14$ units and $AZ = 6$ units, and we are considering the height from $Z$ to $B$. Thus, the area of triangle $BQW$ is half of this, $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 42 = 21$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$",
    "## Step 1: To find the area of triangle $BQW$, we first need to understand the given figure and the information provided.\nThe figure shows a rectangle $ABCD$, with $AZ=WC=6$ units and $AB=12$ units. We are also given that the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is 120 square units.\n\n## Step 2: Let's start by finding the length of $CD$, which is also the length of $AB$ since $ABCD$ is a rectangle.\nGiven that $AB=12$ units, we know that $CD=12$ units as well.\n\n## Step 3: Next, we calculate the length of $ZW$. Since $AZ=WC=6$ units, $ZW$ is parallel to $CD$, and $ABCD$ is a rectangle, we can determine that $ZW=CD=12$ units.\nHowever, to find the length of $ZW$, we should consider the height of the trapezoid $ZWCD$. Let's denote the height of the trapezoid as $h$. Since $AZ=6$ and $AB=12$, $h=AB-AZ=12-6=6$ units.\n\n## Step 4: Given that the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is 120 square units, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid: $\\frac{1}{2}(b_1+b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the parallel bases and $h$ is the height.\nSubstituting the known values, we have $\\frac{1}{2}(ZW+CD)h=120$. Since $CD=12$ and $h=6$, we can solve for $ZW$:\n$\\frac{1}{2}(ZW+12)6=120$.\nSimplifying this equation gives us $ZW+12=40$, so $ZW=40-12=28$ units.\n\n## Step 5: However, we realized that we made an incorrect assumption about the height of the trapezoid. Let's correct this by finding the actual height of the trapezoid $ZWCD$.\nThe height of the trapezoid can be found by considering the given triangles and the rectangle. Let's denote the height of the trapezoid as $h$. Since $AZ=WC=6$, we have $h=AB-AZ=12-6=6$ units is incorrect. Instead, we should find the height using the given area of the trapezoid.\n\n## Step 6: To find the height of the trapezoid $ZWCD$, we use the formula for the area of a trapezoid: $\\frac{1}{2}(b_1+b_2)h=120$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the parallel bases and $h$ is the height.\nLet's denote the length of $ZW$ as $x$. Since $AZ=WC=6$, we have $x=CD=12$ units. Now, we can substitute the known values into the formula: $\\frac{1}{2}(x+12)h=120$.\nWe also know that $h=CD-AZ=12-6=6$ is incorrect. Instead, we should use the given information to find $h$. Since $ZW$ is parallel to $CD$, the height $h$ can be found using the given area.\n\n## Step 7: The area of the trapezoid $ZWCD$ is given as 120 square units. We can use this information to find the height $h$.\nLet's denote the length of $ZW$ as $x$. Since $AZ=WC=6$, we have $x=12$ units. The area formula for the trapezoid becomes $\\frac{1}{2}(12+12)h=120$.\nSimplifying the equation, we get $12h=120$, so $h=10$ units.\n\n## Step 8: Now that we have the correct height of the trapezoid, we can find the length of $QW$ and then calculate the area of triangle $BQW$.\nSince $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$, we have $QW=\\frac{1}{2}ZW$. To find $ZW$, we should consider the rectangle $ABCD$ and the given lengths.\n\n## Step 9: Let's find the length of $ZW$. Since $AZ=WC=6$ units and $AB=12$ units, we can determine that $ZW=CD=12$ units is incorrect. Instead, we should use the given information to find $ZW$.\nConsidering the height $h=10$ and the given area of the trapezoid, we consider the triangle $AZW$. Since $AZ=6$, $ZW=12$ is not the correct way to find $ZW$. We can use the given information about the rectangle and the area of the trapezoid.\n\n## Step 10: Given the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is 120 square units and $h=10$, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid to find $ZW$.\nThe formula becomes $\\frac{1}{2}(ZW+12)10=120$. Solving for $ZW$, we get $ZW+12=24$, so $ZW=12$ units.\n\n## Step 11: Since $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$, we have $QW=\\frac{1}{2}ZW=6$ units.\nNow, we can calculate the area of triangle $BQW$ using the formula for the area of a triangle: $\\frac{1}{2}bh$.\n\n## Step 12: To find the area of triangle $BQW$, we need to determine the base and height of the triangle.\nThe base of triangle $BQW$ is $QW=6$ units, and the height can be found using the given lengths and the rectangle $ABCD$.\n\n## Step 13: The height of the triangle $BQW$ can be found by considering the rectangle $ABCD$ and the given lengths.\nSince $AZ=WC=6$ units and $AB=12$ units, the height of triangle $BQW$ is $BQ=12-6=6$ units is incorrect. Instead, we should use the given information to find the height.\n\n## Step 14: Let's find the height of triangle $BQW$. Considering the rectangle $ABCD$, we have $AB=12$ units and $AZ=6$ units.\nThe height of triangle $BQW$ is $BQ=AB-AZ=12-6=6$ units.\n\n## Step 15: Now that we have the base and height of triangle $BQW$, we can calculate its area using the formula for the area of a triangle: $\\frac{1}{2}bh$.\nSubstituting the known values, we get $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 = 24$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$"
