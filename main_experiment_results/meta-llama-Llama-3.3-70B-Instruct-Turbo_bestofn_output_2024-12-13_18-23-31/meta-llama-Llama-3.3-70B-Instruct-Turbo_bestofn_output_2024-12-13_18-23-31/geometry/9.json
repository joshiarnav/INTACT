    "## Step 1: Determine the formula for the volume of a cylinder\nThe volume \\(V\\) of a cylinder is given by the formula \\(V = \\pi r^2 h\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the cylinder's base and \\(h\\) is the height (or thickness) of the cylinder.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the radius of the pizza\nGiven that the diameter of the pizza is 12 inches, the radius \\(r\\) is half of the diameter, so \\(r = 12 / 2 = 6\\) inches.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the volume of the whole pizza\nUsing the volume formula and given that the pizza is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of an inch thick, we substitute \\(r = 6\\) inches and \\(h = \\frac{1}{3}\\) inch into the volume formula: \\(V = \\pi (6)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\).\n\n## Step 4: Perform the calculation for the volume of the whole pizza\n\\(V = \\pi (36) \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 12\\pi\\) cubic inches.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the volume of one piece of the pizza\nSince the pizza is cut into 12 congruent pieces, the volume of one piece is the total volume of the pizza divided by 12: \\(V_{\\text{one piece}} = \\frac{12\\pi}{12} = \\pi\\) cubic inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\pi}$",
