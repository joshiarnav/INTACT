    "## Step 1: Recall the unit circle definition of cosine\nThe cosine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. However, for angles greater than 90 degrees, we use the unit circle to define cosine. In the unit circle, the cosine of an angle is the x-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the angle to a corresponding angle in the unit circle\nThe angle 240 degrees is in the third quadrant of the unit circle. To find its corresponding angle in the first quadrant, we subtract 180 degrees: 240 - 180 = 60 degrees. This means the reference angle for 240 degrees is 60 degrees.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the cosine of the reference angle\nThe cosine of 60 degrees is known to be 1/2 or 0.5. This is a standard angle with well-known trigonometric ratios.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the sign of the cosine in the third quadrant\nIn the third quadrant, the x-coordinate (which corresponds to the cosine of an angle) is negative.\n\n## Step 5: Combine the sign from the quadrant with the cosine of the reference angle\nSince the cosine of 60 degrees is 0.5 and the cosine in the third quadrant is negative, the cosine of 240 degrees is -0.5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-0.5}$",

This is a standard trigonometric value that can be recalled from memory or derived from the properties of an equilateral triangle.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the sign of the cosine in the third quadrant\nIn the third quadrant of the unit circle, the cosine function is negative. This is because the x-coordinate of any point in the third quadrant is negative.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the sign to the cosine of 60 degrees to find the cosine of 240 degrees\nSince the cosine in the third quadrant is negative, we multiply the cosine of 60 degrees by -1 to get the cosine of 240 degrees.
