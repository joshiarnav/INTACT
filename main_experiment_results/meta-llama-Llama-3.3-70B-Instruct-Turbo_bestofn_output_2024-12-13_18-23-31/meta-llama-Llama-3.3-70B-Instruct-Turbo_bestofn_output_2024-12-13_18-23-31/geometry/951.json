    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the figure\nWe are given a square piece of paper $ABCD$ with each side measuring 6 cm. The paper is folded along the line $GF$ such that corner $C$ coincides with $E$, the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$. We need to find the length of $\\overline{FD}$ after the fold.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key properties after the fold\nAfter folding, $\\overline{CF}$ becomes $\\overline{EF}$, so $CF=EF=6-x$, where $x$ is the length of $\\overline{FD}$. Also, since $ABCD$ is a square, angle $FDE$ is a right angle.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $\\triangle FDE$, we get $(6-x)^2=x^2+3^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for x\nExpanding the equation, we have $36-12x+x^2=x^2+9$. Simplifying, we get $36-12x=9$, which further simplifies to $27=12x$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = \\frac{9}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{4}}$",
