    "## Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe have a unit cube, and one of its corners is chopped off in such a way that the cut passes through the three vertices adjacent to the chosen corner. This means the cut surface is an equilateral triangle, given the symmetry of the cube.\n\n## Step 2: Visualizing the Cut\nWhen the corner is cut off, the freshly cut face is a triangle (since it cuts through three adjacent vertices), and this face will be placed on a table. The height of the remaining cube will be perpendicular to this face.\n\n## Step 3: Determining the Height\nTo find the height of the remaining cube, we need to understand the geometry of the cut. The cut face is an equilateral triangle, and the original cube has edges of length 1 (since it's a unit cube). The height of the remaining cube will be the distance from the cut face to the opposite vertex of the cube.\n\n## Step 4: Using Geometry to Find Height\nConsider the cube's structure: when a corner is cut off, the remaining part of the cube can be seen as a pyramid with its apex being the vertex opposite to the cut face and its base being the cut face (an equilateral triangle). The original cube has side lengths of 1. When the corner is cut, the triangle formed is equilateral, and each side of this triangle cuts a face of the cube into two segments, effectively creating a smaller equilateral triangle on each face adjacent to the cut corner.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the Height\nTo calculate the height of the remaining cube, we consider the altitude of the tetrahedron formed by the cut. This altitude (height) can be found by understanding that the tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron (given the cube's symmetry and the nature of the cut), and for such a tetrahedron, the height (altitude) can be calculated based on the side length of the cube. The formula for the height (h) of a regular tetrahedron inscribed in a cube, where the cube has side length a, is \\(h = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}a\\). Since our cube is a unit cube (a = 1), substituting a = 1 into the formula gives us \\(h = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}}$",
    "## Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe problem involves a unit cube with one corner chopped off in such a way that the cut passes through the three vertices adjacent to the chosen corner. This means the cut creates a new triangular face on the cube.\n\n## Step 2: Visualizing the Cut\nWhen the corner is cut off, it exposes a triangular face because the cut intersects the three edges of the cube that meet at the corner that was removed. This triangular face is an equilateral triangle since the cube is a unit cube, and all its edges are of equal length.\n\n## Step 3: Determining the Height\nTo find the height of the remaining cube when this freshly cut face is placed on a table, we need to understand the geometry involved. The cut creates a tetrahedron that is removed from the cube. The remaining solid is a polyhedron with one face being an equilateral triangle.\n\n## Step 4: Calculating the Height of the Remaining Cube\nThe key to solving this problem is recognizing that the height of the remaining cube, when the cut face is placed on the table, corresponds to the distance from the plane of the cut (the equilateral triangle face) to the opposite face of the cube. This situation can be analyzed by considering the geometry of the removed tetrahedron and the remaining solid.\n\n## Step 5: Applying Geometric Principles\nThe tetrahedron that is removed has a base that is an equilateral triangle, and its three sides are the faces of the cube that meet at the chopped corner. By using the principles of geometry and the properties of an equilateral triangle, we can calculate the height of the remaining cube.\n\n## Step 6: Calculation\nThe height (h) of the tetrahedron that is cut off can be found by considering it as a part of the cube. If we imagine a line from the vertex of the cut to the center of the opposite face of the cube, this line would be perpendicular to the base of the tetrahedron (the equilateral triangle) and would bisect it. The volume of the tetrahedron can be related to the volume of the cube, but for finding the height of the remaining part, we focus on geometric relations.\n\n## Step 7: Geometric Relation for Height\nGiven the cube's structure, the cut creates a situation where the remaining height can be derived from the properties of the equilateral triangle and the geometry of the cube. The height of the remaining solid can be found using the formula for the distance from a point to a plane or by analyzing similar triangles formed within the cube.\n\n## Step 8: Finalizing the Calculation\nSince the cut passes through the midpoints of the edges of the cube adjacent to the corner being removed, it effectively creates a smaller equilateral triangle on the face of the cube opposite to where the corner was. The height of the remaining cube, when placed on the freshly cut face, would thus relate to the proportions of the cube and the geometry of the cut.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and visualize the scenario\nThe problem describes a unit cube with one corner chopped off in such a way that the cut runs through the three vertices adjacent to the chosen corner. This means that the cut surface is a triangle, and when this freshly-cut face is placed on a table, we need to find the height of the remaining cube.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the geometry of the cut\nWhen the corner is chopped off, the cut surface is a triangular face. Since the cut runs through the three vertices adjacent to the chosen corner, this triangular face is an equilateral triangle because all the edges of the cube are of equal length (since it's a unit cube), and the cut is symmetric with respect to these edges.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area of the cut surface\nThe cut surface is an equilateral triangle with side length 1 (since it's a unit cube). To find the area of an equilateral triangle, we use the formula: Area = (\u221a3 / 4) * side^2. So, the area of the cut surface is (\u221a3 / 4) * 1^2 = \u221a3 / 4.\n\n## Step 4: Understand the relationship between the cut surface and the height of the remaining cube\nWhen the cut surface is placed on a table, the height of the remaining cube is perpendicular to this surface. The volume of the removed piece (the tetrahedron) is 1/6 of the volume of the unit cube because it is formed by cutting off one corner of the cube, which is symmetric and involves 1/6 of the cube's volume when considering the total of 6 possible corners and the corresponding volumes of the tetrahedrons formed by cutting each one.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the height of the remaining cube\nThe volume of the removed tetrahedron is 1/6 of the cube's volume. The cube has a volume of 1^3 = 1 cubic unit. Therefore, the volume of the tetrahedron is 1/6 cubic units. The formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given its base area (A) and height (h) is V = (1/3) * A * h. Since the base of the tetrahedron is the equilateral triangle formed by the cut, and we know its area is \u221a3 / 4, we can set up the equation: 1/6 = (1/3) * (\u221a3 / 4) * h. Solving for h gives us the height from the cut surface to the vertex, but what we need is the height of the remaining part of the cube when placed on the table.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the actual height of the remaining cube\nGiven the equation 1/6 = (1/3) * (\u221a3 / 4) * h, simplifying it yields h = (1/6) * (3) * (4 / \u221a3) = 2 / \u221a3. However, this is the height from the base of the tetrahedron to its apex, not the height of the remaining cube. The height of the remaining cube when the freshly-cut face is placed on the table can be understood by considering the geometry of the cube and the removed tetrahedron. The height we calculated is related to the internal structure of the tetrahedron, not directly the height of the remaining cube. Since the cut removes a corner and the remaining part is placed on the cut surface, the actual height is related to the altitude of the tetrahedron from its base (the cut surface) to the opposite vertex. The correct approach involves understanding that the removed piece's volume helps us understand the proportion of the cube's volume removed but does not directly give us the height of the remaining part without considering the geometry of the cut and the resulting figure.\n\n## Step 7: Re-evaluate the geometry for the correct solution\nTo find the height of the remaining cube, consider the cube's structure and the effect of removing the corner. The removed piece is a tetrahedron, and its removal exposes a triangular face. The key insight is recognizing that the height of the remaining cube, when the cut face is on the table, relates to the distance from the cut surface to the opposite face of the cube. This involves understanding the spatial relationships and applying geometric principles correctly to find the height.\n\n## Step 8: Apply similar triangles or geometric principles to solve\nThe correct approach to finding the height involves recognizing the geometric relationships between the parts of the cube and the tetrahedron. By visualizing or drawing the cube and the removed tetrahedron, one can see that the problem involves understanding the proportions and relationships between the different parts of the cube after the corner is removed. The height of the remaining cube can be found by considering the perpendicular distance from the cut surface to the opposite face of the cube.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$"
