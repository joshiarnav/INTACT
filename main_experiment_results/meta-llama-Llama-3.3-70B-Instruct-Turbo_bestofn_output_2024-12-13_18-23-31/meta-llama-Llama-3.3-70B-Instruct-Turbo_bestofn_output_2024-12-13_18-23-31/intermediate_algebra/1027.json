    "## Step 1: Understanding the given function\nThe given function is $f(x,y,z) = \\frac{x}{x + y} + \\frac{y}{y + z} + \\frac{z}{z + x}.$ We are asked to find the set of all possible values of $f(x,y,z)$ for positive real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z$.\n\n## Step 2: Establishing lower and upper bounds\nSince $x,$ $y,$ $z$ are positive real numbers, we notice that each fraction $\\frac{x}{x + y}$, $\\frac{y}{y + z}$, and $\\frac{z}{z + x}$ is less than 1 because the denominator is always greater than the numerator. This means $f(x,y,z) < 3$.\n\n## Step 3: Exploring the lower bound\nTo find a lower bound, we observe that if any of $x,$ $y,$ or $z$ is much larger than the others, the function values will approach 1 for the dominant term and approach 0 for the other terms, because the larger denominator in those fractions will make the fractions smaller. However, since all $x,$ $y,$ $z$ are positive, we cannot actually reach 0 or 3, but we can get arbitrarily close.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing the function for lower limit\nConsider the case where $x = y = z$. Plugging this into $f(x,y,z)$ gives $f(x,x,x) = \\frac{x}{x + x} + \\frac{x}{x + x} + \\frac{x}{x + x} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$. This is a specific value the function can take, indicating that $f(x,y,z)$ can be $\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Considering the range of possible values\nGiven that $f(x,y,z)$ can approach but never actually reach 3, and it can achieve $\\frac{3}{2}$, and considering symmetry and the nature of the fractions, the function should be able to achieve values between 1 and 2. It's also reasonable to consider that values slightly above 1 and below 2 are achievable as $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ vary.\n\n## Step 6: Proving the lower limit is 1\nFor any positive $x,$ $y,$ $z$, we can see that $f(x,y,z) > 1$ because each term is positive and contributes to the sum. However, we must prove that $f(x,y,z)$ can be arbitrarily close to 1 but not less than 1. Given the nature of the function, making one variable much smaller than the others will result in the function value approaching 1.\n\n## Step 7: Establishing the range\nFrom steps 2 through 6, we have established that $f(x,y,z)$ can approach but not reach 3, can achieve $\\frac{3}{2}$, and can approach but not go below 1. Thus, the set of all possible values of $f(x,y,z)$ is greater than 1 and less than 3, but includes $\\frac{3}{2}$ as a specific achievable value.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(1,2)}$",
    "## Step 1: Understanding the given function\nThe function $f(x,y,z) = \\frac{x}{x + y} + \\frac{y}{y + z} + \\frac{z}{z + x}$ involves the variables $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ as positive real numbers.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the function's behavior\nSince $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are positive real numbers, each term of the function $f(x,y,z)$ is also positive.\n\n## Step 3: Establishing lower bounds for each term\nFor any positive real numbers $a$ and $b$, $\\frac{a}{a+b} < 1$ because $a < a + b$. Therefore, each term of $f(x,y,z)$ is less than 1.\n\n## Step 4: Finding the lower bound of $f(x,y,z)$\nBecause each term is less than 1 and there are three terms, the sum $f(x,y,z)$ must be less than 3.\n\n## Step 5: Examining equality conditions\nEquality occurs in $\\frac{x}{x+y} < 1$ only when $y$ approaches 0, and similarly for the other terms. However, since $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are positive, equality cannot occur for any of the terms.\n\n## Step 6: Establishing the upper bound\nTo find the lower bound of $f(x,y,z)$, notice that if $x = y = z$, then $f(x,y,z) = \\frac{3}{2}$ because each term becomes $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 7: Considering the range of $f(x,y,z)$\nGiven that $f(x,y,z)$ can approach 1 (when one of $x,$ $y,$ or $z$ is much larger than the others) but cannot reach 1, and $f(x,y,z)$ can be $\\frac{3}{2}$ (when $x = y = z$), we consider what happens when the variables are unequal.\n\n## Step 8: Analyzing the impact of variable ratios\nAs the ratio between any two variables ($x$ to $y$, $y$ to $z$, $z$ to $x$) increases, the function value moves away from $\\frac{3}{2}$. However, because each term is always positive and less than 1, the sum must always be greater than 1.\n\n## Step 9: Examining limits for the function\nWhen one variable is much larger than the others, the function approaches 1 because two terms approach 0 and one term approaches 1.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion on the range of $f(x,y,z)$\nGiven that $f(x,y,z)$ can approach 1 but not reach it, and it can reach $\\frac{3}{2}$, and considering the behavior as variables change, $f(x,y,z)$ must be greater than 1 and less than 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(1,2)}$",

We are asked to find the set of all possible values of $f(x,y,z)$ for positive real numbers $x, y, z$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the function's components\nEach component of the function $f(x,y,z)$ is a fraction of the form $\\frac{a}{a + b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers. This type of fraction is always less than 1 because the denominator is always greater than the numerator.\n\n## Step 3: Finding the lower bound\nSince each term of $f(x,y,z)$ is of the form $\\frac{a}{a + b}$, and $0 < \\frac{a}{a + b} < 1$, the sum of these terms must be greater than 1, because if we had $x = y = z$, then each term would be $\\frac{1}{2}$, resulting in $f(x,y,z) = \\frac{3}{2}$. However, to prove the lower bound more rigorously, we can observe that for any positive $x, y, z$, the inequality $\\frac{x}{x + y} > 0$ holds, and similarly for the other terms. Thus, $f(x,y,z) > 0$. Furthermore, since the terms are symmetric and each term is less than 1, the minimum value should occur when $x = y = z$, giving us $f(x,y,z) = \\frac{3}{2}$ as a potential lower bound for the specific case of equality, but we need to show that $f(x,y,z) > 1$ in general.\n\n## Step 4: Proving $f(x,y,z) > 1$\nTo prove that $f(x,y,z) > 1$, consider the following: since $\\frac{x}{x + y} + \\frac{y}{x + y} = 1$, we can rearrange this to show that $\\frac{x}{x + y} = 1 - \\frac{y}{x + y}$. Applying similar logic to the other terms, we can see that $f(x,y,z)$ can be rewritten in a way that shows its components must sum to more than 1 because of the overlapping contributions of $x, y, z$ in each denominator. More directly, we can observe that if $f(x,y,z) \\leq 1$, then given the strict positivity of $x, y, z$, it's impossible for the sum of these fractions to be less than or equal to 1 because each fraction contributes a positive value, and their sum must reflect the distribution of $x, y, z$ across the terms.\n\n## Step 5: Finding the upper bound\nFor the upper bound, consider that each term $\\frac{x}{x + y}$, $\\frac{y}{y + z}$, and $\\frac{z}{z + x}$ is less than 1. If we try to maximize $f(x,y,z)$, we see that making any one of $x, y, z$ very large compared to the others will not increase the value of $f(x,y,z)$ beyond a certain point, because the terms are balanced against each other. However, we can show more rigorously that $f(x,y,z) < 2$ by noting that for any positive real numbers $a, b$, $\\frac{a}{a + b} < 1$, and thus the sum of three such terms cannot exceed 2, especially since each term's denominator includes the sum of two different variables, preventing any single term from approaching 1 too closely when the others are also considered.\n\n## Step 6: Combining bounds and considering equality cases\nGiven the above steps, $f(x,y,z)$ must be greater than 1 but less than 2. The exact lower and upper bounds can be approached but not reached under certain conditions. For instance, to approach the lower bound of $\\frac{3}{2}$, we let $x = y = z$. To approach the upper bound of 2, we could consider cases where one variable is much larger than the others, but due to the cyclic nature of $f(x,y,z)$, the function will not actually reach 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(1,2)}$"
