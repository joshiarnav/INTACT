    "## Step 1: Rewrite the equation for better understanding\nStart with the given equation: \\[\\sqrt{x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} + 2 = \\sqrt{x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} - 2.\\] To simplify, let's move the constants to one side: \\[\\sqrt{x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} - \\sqrt{x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} = -4.\\]\n\n## Step 2: Square both sides to eliminate the square roots\nSquaring both sides of the equation \\[\\sqrt{x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} - \\sqrt{x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} = -4\\] yields \\[(\\sqrt{x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} - \\sqrt{x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}})^2 = (-4)^2.\\] Expanding the left side gives \\[x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4} - 2\\sqrt{(x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4})(x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4})} + x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4} = 16.\\]\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation after squaring\nSimplifying, we notice that the $-4\\sqrt{x-4}$ and $+4\\sqrt{x-4}$ cancel out, resulting in \\[2x - 2\\sqrt{(x - 4 \\sqrt{x! - 4})(x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4})} = 16.\\] The expression under the square root simplifies to \\[2x - 2\\sqrt{x^2 - 16(x-4)} = 16.\\]\n\n## Step 4: Further simplify the equation\nThis simplifies to \\[2x - 2\\sqrt{x^2 - 16x + 64} = 16.\\] Further simplification yields \\[2x - 2\\sqrt{(x-8)^2} = 16,\\] which then becomes \\[2x - 2|x-8| = 16.\\]\n\n## Step 5: Consider the cases for the absolute value\nFor $x > 8$, $|x-8| = x-8$, so the equation becomes \\[2x - 2(x-8) = 16,\\] simplifying to \\[2x - 2x + 16 = 16,\\] which simplifies to \\[16 = 16.\\] This means all $x > 8$ satisfy the equation. For $4 < x \\leq 8$, $|x-8| = -(x-8)$, so the equation becomes \\[2x - 2(-(x-8)) = 16,\\] simplifying to \\[2x + 2x - 16 = 16,\\] which gives \\[4x = 32,\\] and thus \\[x = 8.\\] However, since we are considering $x > 4$ and the behavior of the absolute value, the solution $x=8$ is included in the range of $x > 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[8, \\infty)}$",
    "## Step 1: Initial Equation\nWe are given the equation \\[\\sqrt{x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} + 2 = \\sqrt{x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} - 2.\\] The goal is to solve for $x > 4$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, let's simplify the equation by isolating the square root terms. We can start by moving the constants to one side: \\[\\sqrt{x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} - \\sqrt{x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} = -4.\\]\n\n## Step 3: Square Both Sides\nTo eliminate the square roots, we will square both sides of the equation. Squaring gives: \\[(\\sqrt{x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} - \\sqrt{x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}})^2 = (-4)^2.\\] Expanding this yields \\[x - 4\\sqrt{x - 4} - 2\\sqrt{(x - 4\\sqrt{x - 4})(x + 4\\sqrt{x - 4})} + x + 4\\sqrt{x - 4} = 16.\\]\n\n## Step 4: Simplify After Squaring\nSimplifying the equation results in \\[2x - 2\\sqrt{(x - 4\\sqrt{x - 4})(x + 4\\sqrt{x - 4})} = 16.\\] Further simplification of the term under the square root gives \\[2x - 2\\sqrt{x^2 - 16(x - 4)} = 16.\\] Simplifying inside the square root: \\[2x - 2\\sqrt{x^2 - 16x + 64} = 16.\\] Which simplifies to \\[2x - 2\\sqrt{(x - 8)^2} = 16.\\]\n\n## Step 5: Solve for x\nSince $\\sqrt{(x - 8)^2} = |x - 8|$, and knowing $x > 4$, we have \\[2x - 2|x - 8| = 16.\\] For $x > 8$, $|x - 8| = x - 8$, so the equation becomes \\[2x - 2(x - 8) = 16,\\] which simplifies to \\[2x - 2x + 16 = 16,\\] resulting in \\[16 = 16.\\] This means all $x > 8$ satisfy the simplified equation, but we need to check the validity of this solution in the original equation.\n\n## Step 6: Validate Solution\nLet's substitute $x > 8$ back into the original equation to validate. For $x > 8$, \\[\\sqrt{x - 4\\sqrt{x - 4}} + 2 = \\sqrt{x + 4\\sqrt{x - 4}} - 2\\] becomes \\[\\sqrt{x - 4\\sqrt{x - 4}} - \\sqrt{x + 4\\sqrt{x - 4}} + 4 = 0.\\] After squaring both sides and simplifying, we indeed find that $x > 8$ could be a valid solution set, but to ensure accuracy, let's correct the process by directly addressing the equation without assuming $x > 8$ initially.\n\n## Step 7: Correcting the Approach\nGiven the misstep in assuming $x > 8$ without direct derivation, let's correct the approach. After squaring both sides and simplifying, we had \\[2x - 2\\sqrt{(x - 8)^2} = 16.\\] Since $\\sqrt{(x - 8)^2} = |x - 8|$, for $x > 4$, we consider $x \\geq 8$ for $|x - 8| = x - 8$. Thus, \\[2x - 2(x - 8) = 16,\\] simplifying to \\[16 = 16,\\] indicating that our solution should satisfy $x \\geq 8$ without directly implying all $x > 4$ are solutions.\n\n## Step 8: Finalizing Solution\nConsidering the domain $x > 4$ and the nature of the equation, the solution set should indeed reflect values where the expressions under the square roots are non-negative and the equation holds true. Given the correction and validation, the solution indicates $x$ should be such that it satisfies the original equation without violating the domain or the square root constraints.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[8, \\infty)}$",
    "## Step 1: Start by simplifying the given equation to make it easier to solve.\nGiven the equation \\[\\sqrt{x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} + 2 = \\sqrt{x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} - 2,\\] let's first move the constants to one side to isolate the square root terms. This gives us \\[\\sqrt{x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} - \\sqrt{x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} = -4.\\]\n\n## Step 2: Attempt to eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation.\nTo eliminate the square roots, we'll square both sides of the equation \\[\\sqrt{x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} - \\sqrt{x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} = -4.\\] Squaring both sides yields \\[(\\sqrt{x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}} - \\sqrt{x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}})^2 = (-4)^2,\\] which expands to \\[x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4} - 2\\sqrt{(x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4})(x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4})} + x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4} = 16.\\]\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation after squaring both sides.\nAfter expanding, the equation simplifies to \\[2x - 2\\sqrt{(x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4})(x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4})} = 16.\\] The term under the square root can be further simplified as \\[(x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4})(x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}) = x^2 - 16(x - 4) = x^2 - 16x + 64.\\] Thus, the equation becomes \\[2x - 2\\sqrt{x^2 - 16x + 64} = 16.\\]\n\n## Step 4: Further simplify and solve the equation.\nSimplifying the equation gives us \\[2x - 16 = 2\\sqrt{x^2 - 16x + 64}.\\] Dividing by 2, we get \\[x - 8 = \\sqrt{x^2 - 16x + 64}.\\] Squaring both sides again to eliminate the square root yields \\[(x - 8)^2 = x^2 - 16x + 64,\\] which expands to \\[x^2 - 16x + 64 = x^2 - 16x + 64.\\] This equation is an identity and thus true for all real values of $x$. However, we need to consider the restrictions imposed by the square root functions and the initial condition $x > 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the domain restrictions of the square root functions.\nGiven the original equation involves $\\sqrt{x - 4}$, we must ensure that $x - 4 \\geq 0$, which implies $x \\geq 4$. Since the problem specifies $x > 4$, all solutions must adhere to this condition. Additionally, the expressions under the square roots must be non-negative. For $\\sqrt{x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}}$ and $\\sqrt{x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}}$ to be real, $x - 4 \\sqrt{x - 4} \\geq 0$ and $x + 4 \\sqrt{x - 4} \\geq 0$. The latter is always true given $x > 4$, but the former requires $x \\geq 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}$.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the condition $x \\geq 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}$.\nLet's solve $x = 4 \\sqrt{x - 4}$ to find any critical points. Squaring both sides gives $x^2 = 16(x - 4)$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 16x + 64 = 0$. This factors as $(x - 8)^2 = 0$, so $x = 8$. Thus, the condition from the square root is satisfied for $x \\geq 8$ given the initial requirement that $x > 4$.\n\n## Step 7: Combine all conditions to find the solution set.\nConsidering all conditions, we find that $x$ must satisfy $x > 4$ and the specific condition derived from ensuring the square root expressions are non-negative, which led to $x \\geq 8$ as a critical point from the squared equation. However, we must remember that our steps involved squaring, which might introduce extraneous solutions. Checking the validity of solutions in the original equation is crucial.\n\n## Step 8: Validate the solution by checking against the original equation.\nPlugging $x = 8$ back into the original equation to verify its validity: \\[\\sqrt{8 - 4 \\sqrt{8 - 4}} + 2 = \\sqrt{8 + 4 \\sqrt{8 - 4}} - 2,\\] simplifies to \\[\\sqrt{8 - 4 \\cdot 2} + 2 = \\sqrt{8 + 4 \\cdot 2} - 2,\\] which further simplifies to \\[\\sqrt{0} + 2 = \\sqrt{16} - 2,\\] and then to \\[0 + 2 = 4 - 2,\\] confirming that $x = 8$ is indeed a solution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[8,\\infty)}$"
