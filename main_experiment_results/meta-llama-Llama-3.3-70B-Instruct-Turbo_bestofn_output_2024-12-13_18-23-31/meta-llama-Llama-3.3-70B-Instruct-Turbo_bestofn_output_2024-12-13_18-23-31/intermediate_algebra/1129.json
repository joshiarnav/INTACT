    "## Step 1: To find the quotient when $8x^3+16x^2-7x+4$ is divided by $2x+5$, we will perform polynomial long division.\nThe process involves dividing the highest degree term of the dividend by the highest degree term of the divisor, then multiplying the entire divisor by the result, subtracting that from the dividend, and repeating the process with the resulting polynomial until we cannot proceed further.\n\n## Step 2: Divide the leading term of the dividend, $8x^3$, by the leading term of the divisor, $2x$, to get $4x^2$.\nThis will be the first term of the quotient.\n\n## Step 3: Multiply the entire divisor, $2x+5$, by $4x^2$ to get $8x^3 + 20x^2$.\nSubtract this from the original dividend $8x^3+16x^2-7x+4$ to get a new polynomial: $-4x^2 - 7x + 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Now, divide the leading term of the new polynomial, $-4x^2$, by the leading term of the divisor, $2x$, to get $-2x$.\nThis is the next term of the quotient.\n\n## Step 5: Multiply the entire divisor, $2x+5$, by $-2x$ to get $-4x^2 - 10x$.\nSubtract this from the current polynomial $-4x^2 - 7x + 4$ to get $3x + 4$.\n\n## Step 6: Divide the leading term of the resulting polynomial, $3x$, by the leading term of the divisor, $2x$, to get $\\frac{3}{2}$.\nThis is the next term of the quotient.\n\n## Step 7: Multiply the entire divisor, $2x+5$, by $\\frac{3}{2}$ to get $3x + \\frac{15}{2}$.\nSubtract this from the current polynomial $3x + 4$ to get $4 - \\frac{15}{2}$, which simplifies to $-\\frac{7}{2}$.\n\n## Step 8: Since $-\\frac{7}{2}$ is a constant and cannot be divided by $2x$ to get a polynomial term, the division process stops here.\nThe quotient, without the remainder, is $4x^2 - 2x + \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4x^2 - 2x + \\frac{3}{2}}$",
