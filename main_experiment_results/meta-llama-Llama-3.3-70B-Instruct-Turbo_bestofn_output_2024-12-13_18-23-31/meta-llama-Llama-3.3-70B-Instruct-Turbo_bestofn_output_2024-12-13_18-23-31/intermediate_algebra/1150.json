    "## Step 1: Identify the given root and its complex conjugate\nThe given root is $-2 - i \\sqrt{5}$. Since the polynomial has real coefficients, the other root must be the complex conjugate of the given root, which is $-2 + i \\sqrt{5}$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the general form of a monic quadratic polynomial\nA monic quadratic polynomial in $x$ has the form $x^2 + bx + c$, where $b$ and $c$ are coefficients that we need to determine.\n\n## Step 3: Use the sum and product of roots to find the coefficients of the polynomial\nFor a quadratic polynomial $x^2 + bx + c$, the sum of the roots equals $-b$ and the product of the roots equals $c$. The sum of the roots is $(-2 - i \\sqrt{5}) + (-2 + i \\sqrt{5}) = -4$. The product of the roots is $(-2 - i \\sqrt{5}) \\cdot (-2 + i \\sqrt{5}) = (-2)^2 - (i \\sqrt{5})^2 = 4 - (i^2) \\cdot 5 = 4 + 5 = 9$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the coefficients of the polynomial\nFrom the sum of the roots, we have $-b = -4$, so $b = 4$. From the product of the roots, we have $c = 9$. Therefore, the monic quadratic polynomial is $x^2 + 4x + 9$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{x^2 + 4x + 9}$",
    "## Step 1: Recall the Complex Conjugate Root Theorem\nThe Complex Conjugate Root Theorem states that if a polynomial equation with real coefficients has a complex root, then its complex conjugate is also a root of the polynomial. Therefore, if $-2 - i \\sqrt{5}$ is a root, then $-2 + i \\sqrt{5}$ must also be a root.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the Roots\nThe roots of the quadratic polynomial are $-2 - i \\sqrt{5}$ and $-2 + i \\sqrt{5}$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the Roots to Form the Quadratic Equation\nA monic quadratic polynomial can be written in factored form as $(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the roots. Substituting the given roots into this formula gives us $(x - (-2 - i \\sqrt{5}))(x - (-2 + i \\sqrt{5}))$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the Expression\nExpanding the expression $(x + 2 + i \\sqrt{5})(x + 2 - i \\sqrt{5})$ using the difference of squares formula $(a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2$, we get $(x+2)^2 - (i\\sqrt{5})^2$. Simplifying further yields $x^2 + 4x + 4 - (i^2)(\\sqrt{5})^2$. Since $i^2 = -1$, this simplifies to $x^2 + 4x + 4 + 5$.\n\n## Step 5: Final Simplification\nCombining like terms in the expression $x^2 + 4x + 4 + 5$ results in $x^2 + 4x + 9$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{x^2 + 4x + 9}$",

The sum of the roots is $(-2 - i \\sqrt{5}) + (-2 + i \\sqrt{5}) = -4$. The product of the roots is $(-2 - i \\sqrt{5}) \\times (-2 + i \\sqrt{5}) = (-2)^2 - (i \\sqrt{5})^2 =! 4 - (i^2) \\times 5 = 4 + 5 = 9$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the coefficients $b$ and $c$\nFrom Step 3, we have $-b = -4$, so $b = 4$.
