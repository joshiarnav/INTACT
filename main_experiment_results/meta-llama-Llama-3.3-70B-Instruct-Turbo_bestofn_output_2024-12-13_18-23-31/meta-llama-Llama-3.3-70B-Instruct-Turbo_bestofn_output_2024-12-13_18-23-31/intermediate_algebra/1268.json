    "## Step 1: Recall the change of base formula for logarithms\nThe change of base formula for logarithms is $\\log_ba = \\frac{\\log_ca}{\\log_cb}$, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive numbers and $c \\neq 1$. This formula allows us to express a logarithm in terms of another base.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the change of base formula to the given equation\nUsing the change of base formula, we can rewrite $\\frac{1}{\\text{log}_2a}$ as $\\log_a2$, $\\frac{1}{\\text{log}_3a}$ as $\\log_a3$, and $\\frac{1}{\\text{log}_4a}$ as $\\log_a4$. The equation becomes $\\log_a2 + \\log_a3 + \\log_a4 = 1$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the property of logarithms to combine the terms\nThe sum of logarithms with the same base is equal to the logarithm of the product of the numbers inside the logarithms. Therefore, $\\log_a2 + \\log_a3 + \\log_a4 = \\log_a(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4) = \\log_a24$.\n\n## Step 4: Rewrite the equation with the combined logarithm\nThe equation now becomes $\\log_a24 = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $a$\nBy definition, $\\log_a24 = 1$ means that $a^1 = 24$, so $a = 24$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$",
