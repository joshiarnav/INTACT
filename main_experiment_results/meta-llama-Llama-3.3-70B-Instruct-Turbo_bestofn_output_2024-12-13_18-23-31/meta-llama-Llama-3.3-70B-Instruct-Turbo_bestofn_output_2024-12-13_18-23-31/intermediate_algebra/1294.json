    "## Step 1: Recall the relationship between the magnitude of complex numbers and their product.\nThe magnitude of the product of two complex numbers $a$ and $b$ is equal to the product of their magnitudes, i.e., $|ab| = |a||b|$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the given information to find $|ab|$.\nGiven $|a|=2$ and $|b|=\\sqrt{26}$, we can calculate $|ab|$ as $|ab| = |a||b| = 2 \\times \\sqrt{26} = 2\\sqrt{26}$.\n\n## Step 3: Express $ab$ in terms of $t$ and find its magnitude.\nGiven $ab = t-2i$, the magnitude $|ab|$ can also be expressed as $\\sqrt{t^2 + (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{t^2 + 4}$.\n\n## Step 4: Equate the two expressions for $|ab|$ to find $t$.\nSetting the two expressions for $|ab|$ equal to each other gives $2\\sqrt{26} = \\sqrt{t^2 + 4}$. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root yields $(2\\sqrt{26})^2 = t^2 + 4$, which simplifies to $4 \\times 26 = t^2 + 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $t$.\nThe equation simplifies to $104 = t^2 + 4$. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives $100 = t^2$. Taking the square root of both sides, and considering only the positive value of $t$ as requested, yields $t = 10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",
