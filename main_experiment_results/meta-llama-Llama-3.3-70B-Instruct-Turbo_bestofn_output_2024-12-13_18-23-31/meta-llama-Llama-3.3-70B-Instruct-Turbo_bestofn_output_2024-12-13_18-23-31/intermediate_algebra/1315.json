    "## Step 1: To compute the given sum, we first need to analyze the structure of the terms in the series.\nThe series is given by $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})}$. We notice that the denominator can be factored using the difference of squares identity.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the difference of squares identity to the denominator.\nWe can rewrite the denominator as $(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}) = (3^k - 2^k)(3 \\cdot 3^k - 2 \\cdot 2^k)$.\n\n## Step 3: Further simplify the expression by factoring out common terms.\nThis can be simplified to $(3^k - 2^k)(3 \\cdot 3^k - 2 \\cdot 2^k) = 3^k \\cdot 3^{k+1} - 2^k \\cdot 3^{k+1} - 3^k \\cdot 2^{k+1} + 2^k \\cdot 2^{k+1}$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the difference of squares identity to simplify the expression.\nHowever, noticing the structure of the given term, we can simplify it using partial fraction decomposition. Let's assume $\\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})} = \\frac{A}{3^k - 2^k} + \\frac{B}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for A and B in the partial fraction decomposition.\nMultiplying both sides by $(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})$ gives $6^k = A(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}) + B(3^k - 2^k)$. By choosing suitable values for $k$, we can solve for $A$ and $B$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the equation for A and B by choosing suitable values for k.\nLet's set $3^k - 2^k = 0$ to solve for $A$, but since $3^k$ is always greater than $2^k$ for positive $k$, we can't easily solve this way. Instead, we match coefficients or use another method to find $A$ and $B$.\n\n## Step 7: Match coefficients to find A and B.\nNotice that $6^k = 2^k \\cdot 3^k$. We want to express this in a form that matches our partial fraction decomposition. Given that $6^k = A(3^{k+1} - 2^{k+1}) + B(3^k - 2^k)$, we aim to find $A$ and $B$ such that the equation holds.\n\n## Step 8: Plug in values to find A and B.\nTo simplify, let's consider the relationship between terms. Notice that $\\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})} = \\frac{2^k}{3^k - 2^k} - \\frac{2^{k+1}}{3^{k+1} - 2^{k+1}}$ after decomposition.\n\n## Step 9: Realize the telescoping nature of the series.\nThe series now becomes $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{2^k}{3^k - 2^k} - \\frac{2^{k+1}}{3^{k+1} - 2^{k+1}}\\right)$. This is a telescoping series where consecutive terms cancel out.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the telescoping series.\nIn a telescoping series, all terms except the first and last cancel out. Since this is an infinite series, we look at the behavior as $k$ approaches infinity. The term $\\frac{2^{k+1}}{3^{k+1} - 2^{k+1}}$ approaches $0$ as $k$ approaches infinity because $3^{k+1}$ grows faster than $2^{k+1}$.\n\n## Step 11: Compute the remaining term.\nThus, we only need to consider the first term of the series, which is $\\frac{2^1}{3^1 - 2^1} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
    "## Step 1: Decompose the given series into partial fractions to simplify the calculation.\nWe start by expressing the given series in terms of partial fractions, i.e., $\\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})} = \\frac{A}{3^k - 2^k} + \\frac{B}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}}$. This will help us simplify the series into a more manageable form.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the values of A and B using the partial fraction decomposition method.\nTo find the values of A and B, we equate the numerator of the original expression to the sum of the numerators of the partial fractions, which gives $6^k = A(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}) + B(3^k - 2^k)$. By choosing appropriate values for $3^k$ and $2^k$, we can solve for A and B.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for A and B by substituting appropriate values for $3^k$ and $2^k$.\nSetting $3^k = 2^k$ gives $6^k = A(3 \\cdot 2^k - 2 \\cdot 2^k) = A \\cdot 2^k$, from which we find $A = 2^k / 2^k = 1$. Setting $3^{k + 1} = 2^{k + 1}$ gives $6^k = B(3^k - 2^k)$, but since $3^{k + 1} = 3 \\cdot 3^k$ and $2^{k + 1} = 2 \\cdot 2^k$, we can also set $3^k = 2^{k + 1}$ to solve for B. However, we realize that a direct substitution may not be straightforward due to the nature of the equation. Instead, we apply the method of equating coefficients.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the method of equating coefficients to solve for A and B.\nBy expanding the equation $6^k = A(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}) + B(3^k - 2^k)$ and comparing coefficients, we can solve for A and B. However, we recognize that a more efficient approach involves using the structure of the partial fraction decomposition to directly find the coefficients.\n\n## Step 5: Use the structure of the partial fraction decomposition to directly find the coefficients A and B.\nThe partial fraction decomposition of the given series can be rewritten as $\\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})} = \\frac{2^k}{3^k - 2^k} - \\frac{2^{k + 1}}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}}$. This decomposition allows us to directly identify the coefficients A and B.\n\n## Step 6: Compute the sum of the series by applying the partial fraction decomposition.\nBy expressing the series as a sum of partial fractions, we can rewrite it as $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2^k}{3^k - 2^k} - \\frac{2^{k + 1}}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}} \\right)$. This is a telescoping series, where most of the terms cancel each other out, leaving only the first and last terms.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the telescoping series to find the sum.\nThe telescoping series simplifies to $\\frac{2^1}{3^1 - 2^1} - \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{2^{k + 1}}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}}$. Since $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{2^{k + 1}}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}} = 0$, the sum of the series reduces to $\\frac{2^1}{3^1 - 2^1} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
    "## Step 1: Decompose the given series into partial fractions\nTo tackle the given series, we first attempt to decompose the fraction into partial fractions. The given term is $\\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})}$. We express it as $\\frac{A}{3^k - 2^k} + \\frac{B}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}}$.\n\n## Step 2: Find the values of A and B\nMultiplying both sides by $(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})$, we get $6^k = A(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}) + B(3^k - 2^k)$. We will solve for A and B.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for A\nSetting $3^k = 2^k$ to solve for A (which won't actually make the denominators zero but allows us to solve for A), we see this approach doesn't directly simplify to an easy solution because $3^k$ never equals $2^k$ for any positive k. Instead, we'll use the standard method of equating coefficients or substituting convenient values for k that simplify the equation.\n\n## Step 4: Standard approach to solve for A and B\nLet's try setting $3^k = 2^k$ in the equation $6^k = A(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}) + B(3^k - 2^k)$, but since $3^k$ can never equal $2^k$ for any k, we directly apply algebraic manipulations. For simplification, consider the equation $6^k = A(3^{k+1} - 2^{k+1}) + B(3^k - 2^k)$. By observation, we notice that $6^k = 2^k \\cdot 3^k$, and we aim to express this in terms of the given factors.\n\n## Step 5: Solve by choosing suitable values for k\nAnother approach to solve for A and B is to use specific values of k that simplify the denominators. However, a more direct method involves recognizing patterns that fit the given series. Notice that $\\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})}$ can be rewritten using the identity $a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$, but here we directly tackle the partial fractions.\n\n## Step 6: Partial fraction decomposition\nWe observe that $\\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})} = \\frac{2^k}{3^k - 2^k} - \\frac{2^{k+1}}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}}$. This step involves recognizing the pattern that allows the decomposition into simpler fractions, which is crucial for simplifying the series.\n\n## Step 7: Summing the series\nNow, summing the series $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})}$, we substitute the partial fractions back into the series. This gives us $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty (\\frac{2^k}{3^k - 2^k} - \\frac{2^{k+1}}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}})$. We notice this is a telescoping series where consecutive terms cancel out.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the telescoping series\nThe series becomes $(\\frac{2^1}{3^1 - 2^1} - \\frac{2^{2}}{3^{2} - 2^{2}}) + (\\frac{2^2}{3^2 - 2^2} - \\frac{2^{3}}{3^{3} - 2^{3}}) + \\cdots$. We see that each term after the first and before the last cancels out, leaving us with $\\frac{2^1}{3^1 - 2^1}$ as the only remaining term since the series converges and the terms $\\frac{2^{k+1}}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}}$ approach zero as k approaches infinity.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the remaining term\n$\\frac{2^1}{3^1 - 2^1} = \\frac{2}{3 - 2} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
