    "## Step 1: Recognize that the function f(x) is an even function.\nThe function $f(x) = ax^6 + bx^4 - cx^2 + 3$ is an even function because it only contains even powers of x and a constant term. This means $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all values of x.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the property of even functions to f(91) and f(-91).\nGiven that $f(x)$ is an even function, it follows that $f(-91) = f(91)$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate f(91) + f(-91) using the property from step 2.\nSince $f(-91) = f(91)$ and we are given that $f(91) = 1$, then $f(91) + f(-91) = 1 + 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Compute the sum.\nThe sum of $f(91) + f(-91) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
