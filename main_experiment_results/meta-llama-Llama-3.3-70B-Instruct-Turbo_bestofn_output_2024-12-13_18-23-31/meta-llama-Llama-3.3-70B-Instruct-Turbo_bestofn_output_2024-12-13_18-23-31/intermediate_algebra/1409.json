    "## Step 1: To find the range of the function, we need to understand what the range of a function represents.\nThe range of a function is the set of all possible output values it can produce for the given input values.\n\n## Step 2: The given function is \\[f(x) = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}.\\]\nWe are looking for all possible values of $f(x)$ as $x$ varies over all real numbers.\n\n## Step 3: To determine the range, let's consider a number $y$ in the range of $f$.\nThis means there exists a real number $x$ such that \\[y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}.\\]\n\n## Step 4: Rearranging the equation to solve for $x$, we get \\[yx^2-(y+1)x+y=0.\\]\nFor $y$ to be in the range of $f$, this equation must have a real solution for $x$.\n\n## Step 5: The quadratic equation $yx^2-(y+1)x+y=0$ will have real solutions if and only if its discriminant is nonnegative.\nThe discriminant of the quadratic $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $b^2-4ac$. Applying this to our equation, the discriminant is \\[(y+1)^2 - 4(y)(y) = y^2 + 2y + 1 - 4y^2 = -3y^2 + 2y + 1.\\]\n\n## Step 6: For real solutions, we require the discriminant $-3y^2 + 2y + 1 \\geq 0$.\nThis inequality can be solved to find the values of $y$ for which the quadratic has real roots, which in turn gives us the range of $f$.\n\n## Step 7: Solving $-3y^2 + 2y + 1 \\geq 0$, first find the roots of the equation $-3y^2 + 2y + 1 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=-3$, $b=2$, and $c=1$, we get \\[y = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2-4(-3)(1)}}{2(-3)} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4+12}}{-6} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{16}}{-6} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 4}{-6}.\\]\nThus, \\[y = \\frac{-2 + 4}{-6} = \\frac{2}{-6} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\] or \\[y = \\frac{-2 - 4}{-6} = \\frac{-6}{-6} = 1.\\]\n\n## Step 8: Since the coefficient of $y^2$ in the inequality $-3y^2 + 2y + 1 \\geq 0$ is negative, the parabola opens downwards.\nThis means the solution to the inequality will be the interval between the roots, including the roots themselves because of the $\\geq$ sign.\n\n## Step 9: Therefore, the range of $f$ is from $-\\frac{1}{3}$ to $1$, including both $-\\frac{1}{3}$ and $1$.\nSo, the range of $f$ in interval notation is $\\boxed{[-\\frac{1}{3}, 1]}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[-\\frac{1}{3}, 1]}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the function\nTo find the range of the function $f(x) = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}$, we first note that the denominator of the function, $x^2-x+1$, is always positive for any real number $x$. This is because the discriminant of the quadratic equation $x^2-x+1=0$ is $(-1)^2-4(1)(1) = -3$, which is negative, indicating that the quadratic equation has no real roots and the quadratic expression is always positive.\n\n## Step 2: Set up the equation for the range\nLet $y$ be any number in the range of $f$. Then, there exists a real number $x$ such that $y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}$. Rearranging this equation to solve for $x$, we get the quadratic equation $yx^2-(y+1)x+y=0$.\n\n## Step 3: Condition for real roots\nFor $y$ to be in the range of $f$, the quadratic equation $yx^2-(y+1)x+y=0$ must have real roots. This means the discriminant of this quadratic equation, $(y+1)^2-4(y)(y)$, must be non-negative.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the discriminant\nThe discriminant is given by $(y+1)^2-4y^2 = y^2+2y+1-4y^2 = -3y^2+2y+1$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the inequality\nFor the quadratic equation to have real roots, the discriminant must satisfy $-3y^2+2y+1 \\geq 0$. Rearranging this inequality gives $3y^2-2y-1 \\leq 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the quadratic inequality\nTo solve $3y^2-2y-1 \\leq 0$, we can factor the quadratic expression. Unfortunately, this expression does not factor easily, so we use the quadratic formula to find the roots: $y = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2-4(3)(-1)}}{2(3)} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4+12}}{6} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{16}}{6} = \\frac{2 \\pm 4}{6}$. Thus, $y = \\frac{2 + 4}{6} = 1$ or $y = \\frac{2 - 4}{6} = -\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the interval\nThe roots of the equation $3y^2-2y-1 = 0$ are $y = 1$ and $y = -\\frac{1}{3}$. Since the coefficient of $y^2$ (which is 3) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, meaning the inequality $3y^2-2y-1 \\leq 0$ is satisfied between the roots. Therefore, the range of $f(x)$ is $-\\frac{1}{3} \\leq y \\leq 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[-\\frac{1}{3}, 1]}$",
    "## Step 1: Analyze the given function\nThe function given is $f(x) = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}$. To find the range of this function, we need to consider all possible output values ($y$) that this function can produce for any real number input ($x$).\n\n## Step 2: Set up the equation to find the range\nTo find the range, we set $y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}$ and solve for $x$ in terms of $y$. This will help us understand what values of $y$ are possible.\n\n## Step 3: Manipulate the equation\nRearrange the equation to get it in terms of $x$: $y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}$ becomes $yx^2 - yx + y = x$.\n\n## Step 4: Rearrange into a quadratic equation\nFurther rearranging gives us $yx^2 - (y+1)x + y = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$, with coefficients dependent on $y$.\n\n## Step 5: Condition for real solutions\nFor $x$ to have real solutions, the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be non-negative. The discriminant is given by $D = b^2 - 4ac$, where $a = y$, $b = -(y+1)$, and $c = y$. So, $D = [-(y+1)]^2 - 4(y)(y)$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the discriminant\nExpanding the expression for $D$ gives $D = (y+1)^2 - 4y^2 = y^2 + 2y + 1 - 4y^2 = -3y^2 + 2y + 1$.\n\n## Step 7: Set the discriminant to be non-negative\nFor real solutions, $D \\geq 0$, which means $-3y^2 + 2y + 1 \\geq 0$. We need to solve this inequality for $y$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the quadratic inequality\nFirst, find the roots of the equation $-3y^2 + 2y + 1 = 0$ by using the quadratic formula $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = -3$, $b = 2$, and $c = 1$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the roots\nPlugging the values into the quadratic formula gives $y = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{(2)^2 - 4(-3)(1)}}{2(-3)} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 12}}{-6} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{16}}{-6} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 4}{-6}$. So, $y = \\frac{-2 + 4}{-6}$ or $y = \\frac{-2 - 4}{-6}$, which simplifies to $y = \\frac{2}{-6} = -\\frac{1}{3}$ or $y = \\frac{-6}{-6} = 1$.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the interval for the range\nSince the coefficient of $y^2$ in the inequality $-3y^2 + 2y + 1 \\geq 0$ is negative, the parabola opens downwards. This means the solution to the inequality is between the roots. Therefore, the range of $f(x)$ is $-\\frac{1}{3} \\leq y \\leq 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[-\\frac{1}{3}, 1]}$"

  "solution": "Let $y$ be a number in the range of $f.$ This means that there is a real number $x$ such that \\[y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}.\\]Multiplying both sides by $x^2-x+1$ and rearranging, we get the equation \\[yx^2-(y+1)x+y=0.\\]Since $x^2-x+1 = (x-\\tfrac12)^2 + \\tfrac34 > 0$ for all $x,$ our steps are reversible, so $y$ is in the range of $f$ if and only if this equation has a real solution for $x.$ In turn, this equation has a real solution for $x$ if and only if the discriminant of this quadratic is nonnegative. Therefore, the range of $f$ consists exactly of the values of $y$ which satisfy \\[(y+1)^2 - 4y^2 \\ge 0,\\]or \\[0 \\ge 3y^2 - 2y - 1.\\]This quadratic factors as \\[0 \\ge (3y+1)(y-1),\\]which means that the solutions to the inequality are given by $-\\tfrac13 \\le y \\le 1.$ Therefore, the range of $g$ is the closed interval $\\boxed{[-\\tfrac13, 1]}.$",
