    "## Step 1: Understanding the problem statement\nWe need to find the integer closest to the sum $1000\\sum_{n=3}^{10000}\\frac{1}{n^2-4}$.\n\n## Step 2: Breaking down the summation\nTo simplify the summation, we first factor the denominator: $n^2 - 4 = (n+2)(n-2)$.\n\n## Step 3: Applying partial fraction decomposition\nWe can use partial fraction decomposition to simplify $\\frac{1}{n^2-4}$ into $\\frac{1}{(n+2)(n-2)} = \\frac{A}{n-2} + \\frac{B}{n+2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Finding the values of A and B\nMultiplying both sides by $(n+2)(n-2)$, we get $1 = A(n+2) + B(n-2)$. Setting $n = 2$, we find $1 = 4A$, so $A = \\frac{1}{4}$. Setting $n = -2$, we find $1 = -4B$, so $B = -\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 5: Rewriting the summation\nSubstituting the values of A and B back into the decomposition, we have $\\frac{1}{n^2-4} = \\frac{1/4}{n-2} - \\frac{1/4}{n+2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Expanding the summation\nNow, we expand the summation: $\\sum_{n=3}^{10000}\\frac{1}{n^2-4} = \\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{n=3}^{10000}(\\frac{1}{n-2} - \\frac{1}{n+2})$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplifying the telescoping series\nThis series telescopes because terms cancel out: $\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{n=3}^{10000}(\\frac{1}{n-2} - \\frac{1}{n+2}) = \\frac{1}{4}[(\\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4}) - (\\frac{1}{9999} + \\frac{1}{10000} + \\frac{1}{10001} + \\frac{1}{10002})]$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculating the sum\nThe sum simplifies to $\\frac{1}{4}[(1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4}) - (\\frac{1}{9999} + \\frac{1}{10000} + \\frac{1}{10001} + \\frac{1}{10002})]$.\n\n## Step 9: Approximating the sum\nSince $\\frac{1}{9999}$, $\\frac{1}{10000}$, $\\frac{1}{10001}$, and $\\frac{1}{10002}$ are very small, they contribute negligibly to the sum. Thus, we approximate the sum as $\\frac{1}{4}(1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4})$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculating the approximate sum\nThe approximate sum is $\\frac{1}{4}(\\frac{25}{12}) = \\frac{25}{48}$.\n\n## Step 11: Multiplying by 1000\nFinally, we multiply by 1000 to get $1000 * \\frac{25}{48} = \\frac{25000}{48}$.\n\n## Step 12: Calculating the final value\n$\\frac{25000}{48} \\approx 520.83$.\n\n## Step 13: Rounding to the nearest integer\nThe integer closest to $520.83$ is $521$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{521}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a series $1000\\sum_{n=3}^{10000}\\frac1{n^2-4}$ and need to find the integer closest to its sum.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the fraction using partial fractions\nTo simplify the given expression, we can use partial fraction decomposition. The fraction $\\frac{1}{n^2-4}$ can be broken down into partial fractions. First, factor the denominator to get $\\frac{1}{(n-2)(n+2)}$. Then, decompose it into $\\frac{A}{n-2} + \\frac{B}{n+2}$. Solving for A and B gives $A = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $B = -\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 3: Rewrite the series using the partial fractions\nSubstitute the partial fractions back into the series to get $1000\\sum_{n=3}^{10000}\\left(\\frac{1/4}{n-2} - \\frac{1/4}{n+2}\\right)$. This simplifies to $250\\sum_{n=3}^{10000}\\left(\\frac{1}{n-2} - \\frac{1}{n+2}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 4: Expand the series to observe the telescoping effect\nWhen expanding the series, notice that most terms cancel out due to the telescoping nature of the series.

    "## Step 1: Understanding the given series\nThe given series is $1000\\sum_{n=3}^{10000}\\frac1{n^2-4}$. To simplify this, we first need to factor the denominator to get a better understanding of the series. The denominator can be factored into $(n+2)(n-2)$.\n\n## Step 2: Partial fraction decomposition\nWe can use partial fraction decomposition to break down the series into simpler components. The decomposition of $\\frac{1}{n^2-4}$ into partial fractions yields $\\frac{1}{(n-2)(n+2)} = \\frac{A}{n-2} + \\frac{B}{n+2}$. Solving for A and B, we find $A = \\frac{1}{4}$ and $B = -\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 3: Rewriting the series with partial fractions\nSubstituting the values of A and B back into the series, we get $1000\\sum_{n=3}^{10000} \\left( \\frac{1/4}{n-2} - \\frac{1/4}{n+2} \\right)$. This simplifies to $250\\sum_{n=3}^{10000} \\left( \\frac{1}{n-2} - \\frac{1}{n+2} \\right)$.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluating the telescoping series\nThe series is a telescoping series, meaning that many terms will cancel out when expanded. Expanding the series, we notice that terms start canceling out: $250\\left( \\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{8} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{9998} - \\frac{1}{10002} + \\frac{1}{9999} - \\frac{1}{10003} + \\frac{1}{10000} - \\frac{1}{10004} \\right)$. Most terms will cancel except for $\\frac{1}{1}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{3}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, $-\\frac{1}{9999}$, $-\\frac{1}{10000}$, $-\\frac{1}{10001}$, $-\\frac{1}{10002}$, $-\\frac{1}{10003}$, and $-\\frac{1}{10004}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the remaining terms\nThe remaining terms after cancellation are $250\\left( \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{9999} - \\frac{1}{10000} - \\frac{1}{10001} - \\frac{1}{10002} - \\frac{1}{10003} - \\frac{1}{10004} \\right)$. Calculating the sum of these fractions gives us the value of the series.\n\n## Step 6: Performing the calculation\n$250\\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{9999} - \\frac{1}{10000} - \\frac{1}{10001} - \\frac{1}{10002} - \\frac{1}{10003} - \\frac{1}{10004} \\right)$ simplifies to $250\\left( \\frac{25}{12} - \\left( \\frac{1}{9999} + \\frac{1}{10000} + \\frac{1}{10001} + \\frac{1}{10002} + \\frac{1}{10003} + \\frac{1}{10004} \\right) \\right)$. The sum of the fractions from $\\frac{1}{9999}$ to $\\frac{1}{10004}$ is very small compared to $\\frac{25}{12}$, so it has a negligible effect on the overall sum when subtracted.\n\n## Step 7: Final calculation\nThe significant part of the calculation is $250 \\times \\frac{25}{12}$, which equals $\\frac{6250}{12}$. This is approximately $520.83$. The subtraction of the small fractions will slightly reduce this value, but not significantly enough to change the closest integer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{521}$"
