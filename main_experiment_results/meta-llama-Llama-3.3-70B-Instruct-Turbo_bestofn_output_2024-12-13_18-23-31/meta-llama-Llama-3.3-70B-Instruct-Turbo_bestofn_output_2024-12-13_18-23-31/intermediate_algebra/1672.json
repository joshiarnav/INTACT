    "## Step 1: Analyze the given function\nThe given function is $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$. This is a polynomial function of degree 4.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the domain of the function\nThe domain of the function is given as $[0, \\infty)$. This means $x$ can take any value from 0 to infinity.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the minimum value of the function\nSince the domain starts at 0, let's evaluate $q(x)$ at $x = 0$ to find the minimum value. $q(0) = 0^4 + 4(0)^2 + 4 = 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the behavior of the function as x increases\nAs $x$ increases from 0 to infinity, $x^4$ and $4x^2$ will increase without bound. This means $q(x)$ will also increase without bound as $x$ increases.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the range of the function\nGiven that the minimum value of $q(x)$ is 4 and $q(x)$ increases without bound as $x$ increases, the range of $q(x)$ is all values from 4 to infinity.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[4,\\infty)}$",
    "## Step 1: Analyze the given function\nThe given function is $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$. To find the range, we need to understand how this function behaves as $x$ varies over its domain $[0, \\infty)$.\n\n## Step 2: Examine the structure of the function\nNotice that $q(x)$ can be rewritten as $q(x) = (x^2 + 2)^2$. This form makes it clear that $q(x)$ is always non-negative since it is the square of a real number.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the minimum value of the function\nGiven $q(x) = (x^2 + 2)^2$, the minimum value occurs when $x^2 + 2$ is at its smallest, which happens when $x = 0$ because $x^2$ cannot be negative. Substituting $x = 0$ into the equation yields $q(0) = (0^2 + 2)^2 = 4$. Thus, the minimum value of $q(x)$ is 4.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the behavior of the function as x increases\nAs $x$ increases from 0 towards infinity, $x^2$ increases, which means $x^2 + 2$ also increases. Since $q(x)$ is the square of $x^2 + 2$, as $x^2 + 2$ increases, $q(x)$ increases without bound.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the range of the function\nGiven that the minimum value of $q(x)$ is 4 and $q(x)$ increases without bound as $x$ increases from 0 to infinity, the range of $q(x)$ is from 4 to infinity.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[4,\\infty)}$",
    "## Step 1: Analyze the given function\nThe function given is $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$. We are told that the domain of this function is $[0,\\infty)$.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the domain\nThe domain $[0,\\infty)$ means that $x$ can be any real number greater than or equal to 0.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the function for its minimum value\nSince $x^4$ and $4x^2$ are always positive or zero for any real $x$, and given that the domain starts at 0, we should check the value of the function at $x = 0$ to find the minimum value of $q(x)$ because both $x^4$ and $4x^2$ will be 0 at $x = 0$. Thus, $q(0) = 0^4 + 4*0^2 + 4 = 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine if the function increases without bound\nAs $x$ increases beyond 0, both $x^4$ and $4x^2$ increase without bound. This means that $q(x)$ will also increase without bound as $x$ gets larger.\n\n## Step 5: Conclude the range of the function\nGiven that the minimum value of $q(x)$ is 4 (at $x = 0$) and $q(x)$ increases without bound as $x$ increases, the range of $q(x)$ is from 4 to infinity.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[4,\\infty)}$"

  "solution": "We have $q(x) = (x^2+2)^2$. We wish to determine the set of all $y$ for which $q(x)=y$ has solutions. We must have $y\\ge 0$, since $q(x)$ is a square and squares are nonnegative. Under the assumption $y\\ge 0$, we have:\n$$\\begin{array}{r r@{~=~}l}\n& y & (x^2+2)^2 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & \\sqrt y & x^2+2 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & \\sqrt y-2 & x^2 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$We see that $\\sqrt y-2\\ge 0$ because squares are nonnegative. Thus, we need $y\\ge 4$. When $y\\ge 4$, we have $y=q(x)$ by setting $x$ equal to either of $\\pm \\sqrt{\\sqrt y-2}$, and so any $y\\ge 4$ can be achieved.\n\nTherefore, the range of $q(x)$ is $\\boxed{[4,\\infty)}$.",
