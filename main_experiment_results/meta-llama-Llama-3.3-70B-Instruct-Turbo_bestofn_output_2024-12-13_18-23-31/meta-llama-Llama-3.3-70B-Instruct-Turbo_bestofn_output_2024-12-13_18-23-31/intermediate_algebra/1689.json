    "## Step 1: Analyzing the given functions and graphs\nWe are given two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, where $g(x) = af(bx) + c$. The graph of $y = f(x)$ is provided, and we need to determine the ordered triple $(a, b, c)$ based on the graph of $y = g(x)$.\n\n## Step 2: Understanding the transformations applied to $f(x)$ to obtain $g(x)$\nThe function $g(x)$ is a transformation of $f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is stretched horizontally by a factor of $1/b$, stretched vertically by a factor of $|a|$, and then shifted downward by $|c|$ units if $c$ is positive or upward if $c$ is negative.\n\n## Step 3: Identifying the horizontal stretch factor $b$\nBy comparing the graphs of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, we notice that the graph of $g(x)$ is a horizontal stretch of the graph of $f(x)$ by a factor of $2$, since the points on the graph of $g(x)$ are twice as far from the $y$-axis as the corresponding points on the graph of $f(x)$. Therefore, $b = 1/2$.\n\n## Step 4: Identifying the vertical stretch factor $a$\nThe graph of $g(x)$ appears to be the same height as the graph of $f(x)$, indicating that there is no vertical stretch. Hence, $a = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Identifying the vertical shift $c$\nThe graph of $g(x)$ is shifted downward by $4$ units compared to the graph of $f(x)$. This means $c = -4$.\n\n## Step 6: Writing down the ordered triple $(a, b, c)$\nFrom the analysis above, we can conclude that $(a, b, c) = (1, 1/2, -4)$.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( 1, \\  \\frac{1}{2}, \\  -4\\right)}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the type of transformations applied to the graph of $y = f(x)$ to obtain $y = g(x)$.\nThe graph of $y = g(x)$ is a transformation of the graph of $y = f(x)$. By comparing the two graphs, we can see that $y = g(x)$ is obtained by stretching $y = f(x)$ horizontally by a factor of 2 and shifting it down by 4 units.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the values of $b$ and $c$ based on the identified transformations.\nFrom the transformation, we can determine that $b = \\frac{1}{2}$ because the graph is stretched horizontally by a factor of 2, which means $b$ is the reciprocal of the horizontal stretch factor. The value of $c = -4$ because the graph is shifted down by 4 units.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the value of $a$ based on the transformation.\nSince there is no vertical stretch or compression mentioned or visible in the transformation from $f(x)$ to $g(x)$, we can conclude that $a = 1$. This is because the transformation does not involve any scaling in the vertical direction.\n\n## Step 4: Combine the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ to obtain the ordered triple $(a, b, c)$.\nTherefore, the ordered triple is $(1, \\frac{1}{2}, -4)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( 1, \\  \\frac{1}{2}, \\  -4\\right)}$",

The horizontal stretch is by a factor of $2$, since the same $y$-values are attained at $x$-values that are twice as large.\n\n## Step 3: Identifying the vertical shift\nIn addition to the horizontal stretch, the graph of $y = g(x)$ is also shifted downward by $4$ units compared to the graph of $y = f(x)$.\n\n## Step 4: Determining the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$\nThe horizontal stretch corresponds to the value of $b$, which is $\\frac{1}{2}$. The vertical shift corresponds to the value of $c$, which is $-4$. Since there is no vertical stretch, the value of $a$ is $1$.\n\n## Step 5: Writing the ordered triple $(a, b, c)$\nFrom the previous steps, we have determined that $a = 1$, $b = \\frac{1}{2}$, and $c = -4$. Therefore, the ordered triple $(a, b, c)$ is $\\boxed{(1, \\frac{1}{2}, -4)}$.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( 1, \\  \\frac{1}{2}, \\  -4\\right)}$"
