    "## Step 1: Recall the definition of the modulus of a complex number\nThe modulus $|z|$ of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is given by $|z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Use the given equation $z^2 = 24 - 32i$ to find $|z^2|$\nFirst, we need to find the modulus of $z^2$. The modulus $|z^2|$ of $z^2 = 24 - 32i$ is $|z^2| = \\sqrt{24^2 + (-32)^2} = \\sqrt{576 + 1024} = \\sqrt{1600} = 40$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the property $|z^2| = |z|^2$ to find $|z|$\nSince $|z^2| = |z|^2$, we have $|z|^2 = 40$.

Given $z^2 = 24 - 32i$, we first need to find $|z^2|$ to use the property $|z^2| = |z|^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the modulus of $z^2$\nTo find $|z^2|$, we apply the modulus definition to $z^2 = 24 - 32i$. Thus, $|z^2| = \\sqrt{24^2 + (-32)^2} = \\sqrt{576 + 1024} = \\sqrt{1600} = 40$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the property of the modulus of a squared complex number\nSince $|z^2| = |z|^2$, we have $|z|^2 = 40$.
