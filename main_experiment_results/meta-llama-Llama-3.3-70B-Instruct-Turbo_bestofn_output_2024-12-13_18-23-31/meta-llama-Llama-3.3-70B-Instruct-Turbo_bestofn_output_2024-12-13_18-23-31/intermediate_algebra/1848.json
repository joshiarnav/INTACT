    "## Step 1: Recognize that if $2+\\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the given polynomial, then its conjugate $2-\\sqrt{3}$ must also be a root, because the coefficients of the polynomial are rational.\nSince the coefficients of the polynomial are rational, complex or irrational roots must come in conjugate pairs. This means $2-\\sqrt{3}$ is also a root.\n\n## Step 2: Use the two roots to form a quadratic equation that has these roots, which can be done using the pattern $(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the roots.\nThe quadratic equation having $2+\\sqrt{3}$ and $2-\\sqrt{3}$ as roots can be found using the formula for the product of roots: $(x - (2+\\sqrt{3}))(x - (2-\\sqrt{3}))$. Simplifying this expression yields $(x-2-\\sqrt{3})(x-2+\\sqrt{3}) = (x-2)^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 - 3 = x^2 - 4x + 1$.\n\n## Step 3: Since the given equation is a cubic equation, there must be a third root, which we can denote as $r$. The cubic equation can be factored into the product of the quadratic equation found in step 2 and a linear factor $(x - r)$.\nThe cubic equation can be represented as $(x^2 - 4x + 1)(x - r) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10$. We need to expand this and compare coefficients to find $b$.\n\n## Step 4: Expand the product $(x^2 - 4x + 1)(x - r)$ and compare it to the cubic equation $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10$ to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $r$.\nExpanding $(x^2 - 4x + 1)(x - r)$ gives $x^3 - rx^2 - 4x^2 + 4rx + x - r = x^3 - (r + 4)x^2 + (4r + 1)x - r$. Comparing coefficients with $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10$, we have $-(r + 4) = a$ and $4r + 1 = b$.\n\n## Step 5: Use the constant term $-r = 10$ to find $r$, which is $-10$. Then, substitute $r = -10$ into $4r + 1 = b$ to find $b$.\nSolving $-r = 10$ for $r$ gives $r = -10$. Substituting $r = -10$ into $4r + 1 = b$ yields $4(-10) + 1 = b$, which simplifies to $-40 + 1 = b$, so $b = -39$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-39}$",

Thus, \\[b = 1 + (-10)(2+\\sqrt{3}) + (-10)(2-\\sqrt{3}) = 1 - 20 - 10\\sqrt{3} - 20 + 10\\sqrt{3} = 1 - 40 = -39.\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-39}$",
    "## Step 1: Recognize that if $2+\\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the given polynomial, then its conjugate $2-\\sqrt{3}$ must also be a root, because the polynomial has rational coefficients.\nThis is due to the Complex Conjugate Root Theorem, which states that if a polynomial has rational coefficients, and $a + \\sqrt{b}$ is a root of the polynomial (where $a$ and $b$ are rational, and $\\sqrt{b}$ is irrational), then its conjugate $a - \\sqrt{b}$ is also a root.\n\n## Step 2: Find the third root of the polynomial using Vieta's formulas.\nVieta's formulas for a cubic polynomial $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ with roots $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$ state that:\n- $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -a$\n- $r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = b$\n- $r_1r_2r_3 = -c$\nGiven $r_1 = 2 + \\sqrt{3}$ and $r_2 = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$, and $c = 10$, we can use these formulas to find $r_3$ and then $b$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the product of the first two roots to help find the third root.\nThe product of the first two roots is $(2 + \\sqrt{3})(2 - \\sqrt{3}) = 2^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Use Vieta's formulas to find the third root $r_3$.\nFrom Vieta's, $r_1r_2r_3 = -c$.
