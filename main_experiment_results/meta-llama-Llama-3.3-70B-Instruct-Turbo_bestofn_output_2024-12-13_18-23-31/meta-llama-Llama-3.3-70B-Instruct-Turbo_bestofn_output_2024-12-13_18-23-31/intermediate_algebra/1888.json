    "## Step 1: Reflecting the parabola about the x-axis\nWhen the parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is reflected about the x-axis, its equation becomes $y=-ax^2-bx-c$.\n\n## Step 2: Translating the parabola and its reflection horizontally\nThe parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is translated 5 units to the right, resulting in $y=a(x-5)^2+b(x-5)+c$, which simplifies to $y=ax^2+(b-10a)x+(25a-5b+c)$. The reflected parabola $y=-ax^2-bx-c$ is translated 5 units to the left, resulting in $y=-a(x+5)^2-b(x+5)-c$, which simplifies to $y=-ax^2-(b+10a)x+(25a-5b-c)$.\n\n## Step 3: Finding the sum of the translated parabolas\nTo find the equation of $y=(f+g)(x)$, we add the equations of the translated parabolas: $y=(ax^2+(b-10a)x+(25a-5b+c))+(-ax^2-(b+10a)x+(25a-5b-c))$. Simplifying this expression gives $y=-20ax-10b+50a-10b$ or $y=-20ax-20b+50a$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing the resulting equation\nHowever, upon reevaluating the simplification process, we should notice that the $x^2$ terms cancel out when adding $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. The correct simplification after adding the two equations should focus on the cancellation of the quadratic terms and the combination of the linear and constant terms. Thus, $y = (ax^2 + (b-10a)x + (25a-5b+c)) + (-ax^2 - (b+10a)x + (25a-5b-c))$. This simplifies to $y = -20ax - 20b + 50a$, which can be further simplified to $y = -20ax + (50a - 20b)$. This equation represents a line, not a parabola or any higher-order function, because it is in the form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\n## Step 5: Determining the nature of the line\nSince the equation $y = -20ax + (50a - 20b)$ has a variable coefficient for $x$ that depends on $a$, the slope of the line is not necessarily zero ( unless $a=0$), indicating it is not horizontal. The presence of the term $-20ax$ means the line's slope is dependent on the value of $a$, making it non-horizontal for most cases.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(D)}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the transformation of the parabola\nWhen the parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is reflected about the $x$-axis, its equation becomes $y=-ax^2-bx-c$. This is because reflecting about the $x$-axis changes the sign of the $y$ values.\n\n## Step 2: Translate the parabolas horizontally\nThe original parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is translated 5 units to the right, resulting in the equation $y=a(x-5)^2+b(x-5)+c$.

    "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and the transformations applied to the parabola.\nThe problem describes a parabola with the equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ that undergoes a reflection about the $x$-axis. After the reflection, the original parabola and its reflection are translated horizontally five units in opposite directions. This results in two new functions, $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$, representing the translated parabola and its reflection, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the equations of $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$ after the transformations.\nWhen the original parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is reflected about the $x$-axis, its equation becomes $y=-ax^2-bx-c$. The original parabola is then translated 5 units to the right, resulting in $y=f(x) = a(x-5)^2 + b(x-5) + c$. The reflected parabola is translated 5 units to the left, resulting in $y=g(x) = -a(x+5)^2 - b(x+5) - c$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the equation of $y=(f+g)(x)$ by adding the equations of $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$.\nTo find $y=(f+g)(x)$, we add the equations of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$:\n\\[y = (f+g)(x) = a(x!-5)^2 + b(x-5) + c - a(x+5)^2 - b(x+5) - c\\]\n\\[y = a(x^2 - 10x + 25) + b(x - 5) + c - a(x^2 + 10x + 25) - b(x + 5) - c\\]\n\\[y = ax^2 - 10ax + 25a + bx - 5b + c - ax^2 - 10ax - 25a - bx - 5b - c\\]\n\\[y = -20ax - 10b\\]\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the resulting equation to determine the type of graph it represents.\nThe resulting equation $y = -20ax - 10b$ is linear, as it is in the form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. This indicates that the graph of $y=(f+g)(x)$ is a non-horizontal line, since the slope $-20a$ is not necessarily zero.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(D)}$"
