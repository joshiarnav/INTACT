    "## Step 1: Find the horizontal asymptote of the function $f(x) = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}$.\nTo find the horizontal asymptote, we need to consider the limit of the function as $x$ approaches infinity. Since the degrees of the numerator and denominator are the same, the horizontal asymptote is given by the ratio of the leading coefficients of the numerator and denominator. In this case, the leading coefficient of the numerator is 2 and the leading coefficient of the denominator is 1.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the horizontal asymptote.\nThe horizontal asymptote is $y = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$.\n\n## Step 3: Set the function equal to the horizontal asymptote and solve for $x$.\nTo find the value of $x$ where the function crosses its horizontal asymptote, we set $f(x)$ equal to the horizontal asymptote and solve for $x$. So, we have $\\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1} = 2$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation and solve for $x$.\nMultiplying both sides by $x^2 - 4x + 1$, we get $2x^2 - 5x - 7 = 2(x^2 - 4x + 1)$. Expanding the right side gives $2x^2 - 5x - 7 = 2x^2 - 8x + 2$. Subtracting $2x^2$ from both sides gives $-5x - 7 = -8x + 2$. Adding $8x$ to both sides gives $3x - 7 = 2$. Adding 7 to both sides gives $3x = 9$. Dividing both sides by 3 gives $x = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

  "solution": "The horizontal asymptote of $f$ is the horizontal line that $f$ approaches as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. When the leading terms of the numerator and denominator have the same degree, that line is at the value equal to the ratio of the leading coefficients, namely $y = 2/1 = 2$. Setting this equal to $f(x)$, $$f(x) = 2 = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}.$$Clearing the denominator, $$2(x^2 - 4x + 1) = 2x^2 - 8x + 2 = 2x^2 - 5x - 7 \\Longrightarrow 3x = 9 \\Longrightarrow x = \\boxed{3}.$$",
