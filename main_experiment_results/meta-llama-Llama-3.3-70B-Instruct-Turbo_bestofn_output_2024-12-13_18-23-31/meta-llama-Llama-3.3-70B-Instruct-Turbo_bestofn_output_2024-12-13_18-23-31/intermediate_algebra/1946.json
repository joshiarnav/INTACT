    "## Step 1: Recall the complex conjugate root theorem\nThe complex conjugate root theorem states that if a polynomial equation with real coefficients has a complex root, then the conjugate of that complex root is also a root of the polynomial. Since $-2 - 3i$ is a root of the given cubic polynomial, its complex conjugate, $-2 + 3i$, is also a root.\n\n## Step 2: Formulate the quadratic polynomial with the given roots\nUsing the roots $-2 - 3i$ and $-2 + 3i$, we can construct a quadratic equation that has these roots. The product of the roots is $(-2 - 3i)(-2 + 3i) = (-2)^2 - (3i)^2 = 4 + 9 = 13$. The sum of the roots is $(-2 - 3i) + (-2 + 3i) = -4$. A quadratic equation with roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ can be written in factored form as $x^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + (r_1 \\cdot r_2) = 0$. Substituting the sum and product of the roots, we get $x^2 + 4x + 13$.\n\n## Step 3: Factor the cubic polynomial\nThe cubic polynomial can be factored using the quadratic polynomial from Step 2. Since $x^2 + 4x + 13$ represents the non-real roots, the cubic polynomial $ax^3 + 3x^2 + bx - 65$ can be written as $a(x^2 + 4x + 13)(x - r)$, where $r$ is the real root we are trying to find.\n\n## Step 4: Expand the factored form of the cubic polynomial\nExpanding $a(x^2 + 4x + 13)(x - r)$ gives $a(x^3 - rx^2 + 4x^2 - 4rx + 13x - 13r) = a(x^3 + (4 - r)x^2 + (13 - 4r)x - 13r)$.\n\n## Step 5: Match coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given cubic polynomial\nComparing coefficients of $a(x^3 + (4 - r)x^2 + (13 - 4r)x - 13r)$ with $ax^3 + 3x^2 + bx - 65$, we get two important equations: $a(4 - r) = 3$ and $-13ar = -65$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $a$ and $r$ using the equations from Step 5\nSolving $-13ar = -65$ for $r$, we find $r = \\frac{65}{13a} = \\frac{5}{a}$. Substituting $r = \\frac{5}{a}$ into $a(4 - r) = 3$, we get $a(4 - \\frac{5}{a}) = 3$, which simplifies to $4a - 5 = 3$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $a$\nRearranging $4a - 5 = 3$ gives $4a = 8$, so $a = 2$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $r$ using $a = 2$\nSubstituting $a = 2$ into $r = \\frac{5}{a}$ gives $r = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$",

    "## Step 1: Recall the Complex Conjugate Root Theorem\nWhen a polynomial has real coefficients, any complex roots it has appear in conjugate pairs. This means that if $-2 - 3i$ is a root of the given polynomial, its complex conjugate, $-2 + 3i$, is also a root.\n\n## Step 2: Formulate the Quadratic Polynomial Having the Given Roots\nGiven the roots $-2 - 3i$ and $-2 + 3i$, we can construct a quadratic polynomial that has these roots using the pattern $(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the roots. Substituting the given roots, we get $(x - (-2 - 3i))(x - (-2 + 3i)) = (x + 2 + 3i)(x + 2 - 3i)$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the Quadratic Expression\nExpanding $(x + 2 + 3i)(x + 2 - 3i)$ gives $x^2 + 2x - 3ix + 2x + 4 + 6i - 3ix - 6i - 9i^2$. Since $i^2 = -1$, we replace $-9i^2$ with $9$. Also, the $6i$ and $-6i$ cancel out, as do the $-3ix$ and $+3ix$, resulting in $x^2 + 4x + 13$.\n\n## Step 4: Factor the Original Cubic Polynomial\nThe cubic polynomial can be factored as $ax^3 + 3x^2 + bx - 65 = (x^2 + 4x + 13)(ax + c)$ for some real number $c$, since we know $x^2 + 4x + 13$ is a factor due to the complex roots.\n\n## Step 5: Expand and Match Coefficients\nExpanding $(x^2 + 4x + 13)(ax + c)$ yields $ax^3 + (4a + c)x^2 + (13a + 4c)x + 13c$. Matching coefficients with the original cubic polynomial $ax^3 + 3x^2 + bx - 65$, we get $4a + c = 3$ and $13c = -65$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $c$ and Then $a$\nFrom $13c = -65$, solving for $c$ gives $c = -5$. Substituting $c = -5$ into $4a + c = 3$, we get $4a - 5 = 3$, which simplifies to $4a = 8$, hence $a = 2$.\n\n## Step 7: Find $b$\nWith $a = 2$ and $c = -5$, the coefficient of $x$ in the expanded form is $13a + 4c = 13(2) + 4(-5)! = 26 - 20 = 6$. Thus, $b = 6$.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the Real Root\nKnowing $a = 2$ and having the factor $x^2 + 4x + 13$, we look at the constant term of the original polynomial to find the real root. The product of the roots equals $-\\frac{-65}{2} = \\frac{65}{2}$. Since the product of the complex roots is $13$, the real root $r$ satisfies $13r = \\frac{65}{2}$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the Real Root\nSolving $13r = \\frac{65}{2}$ for $r$ gives $r = \\frac{65}{2 \\times 13} = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$"
