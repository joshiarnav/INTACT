    "## Step 1: To solve the given equation, let's first isolate one of the radicals to simplify the equation.\nWe start with the equation \\[\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + \\sqrt{x - 1} = 1.\\] Let's isolate $\\sqrt{x - 1}$ by moving $\\sqrt[3]{2 - x}$ to the other side. This gives us \\[\\sqrt{x - 1} = 1 - \\sqrt[3]{2 - x}.\\]\n\n## Step 2: Next, to eliminate the square root, we'll square both sides of the equation.\nSquaring both sides gives us \\[(\\sqrt{x - 1})^2 = (1 - \\sqrt[3]{2 - x})^2.\\] Simplifying this yields \\[x - 1 = 1 - 2\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + (\\sqrt[3]{2 - x})^2.\\]\n\n## Step 3: We simplify and rearrange the equation to make it easier to solve.\nLet's simplify and rearrange the terms: \\[x - 1 = 1 - 2\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + (2 - x)^{2/3}.\\] This can be further simplified to \\[x - 2 = -2\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + (2 - x)^{2/3}.\\] Let's make a substitution to simplify the equation further: let $y = \\sqrt[3]{2 - x}$, which means $y^3 = 2 - x$ or $x = 2 - y^3$. Substituting $x$ in the equation yields \\[2 - y^3 - 2 = -2y + y^2.\\]\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation after substitution.\nAfter substitution, the equation simplifies to \\[-y^3 = -2y + y^2.\\] Rearranging gives us \\[y^3 - y^2 + 2y = 0.\\] Factoring out a $y$ yields \\[y(y^2 - y + 2) = 0.\\] The quadratic part $y^2 - y + 2$ does not have real roots since its discriminant $(-1)^2 - 4(1)(2) = 1 - 8 = -7$ is negative, meaning it cannot be factored further into real factors. Thus, the only real solution for $y$ from this equation is $y = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $x$ using the solution for $y$.\nGiven $y = \\sqrt[3]{2 - x} = 0$, solving for $x$ gives us $2 - x = 0^3 = 0$, which simplifies to $x = 2$.\n\n## Step 6: Verify the solution by substituting it back into the original equation.\nSubstituting $x = 2$ back into the original equation \\[\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + \\sqrt{x - 1} = 1\\] gives \\[\\sqrt[3]{2 - 2} + \\sqrt{2 - 1} = \\sqrt[3]{0} + \\sqrt{1} = 0 + 1 = 1,\\] which confirms that $x = 2$ is indeed a solution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the goal\nThe given equation is $\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + \\sqrt{x - 1} = 1.$ We need to find all the solutions for $x$ that satisfy this equation.\n\n## Step 2: Isolate one of the radicals\nTo simplify the equation, let's isolate one of the radicals. We can start by isolating $\\sqrt{x - 1}$ on one side. So, we rearrange the equation to get $\\sqrt{x - 1} = 1 - \\sqrt[3]{2 - x}$.\n\n## Step 3: Square both sides to remove the square root\nSquaring both sides of the equation $\\sqrt{x - 1} = 1 - \\sqrt[3]{2 - x}$ gives $x - 1 = (1 - \\sqrt[3]{2 - x})^2$. This step helps to remove the square root.\n\n## Step 4: Expand the squared expression\nExpanding the right side of the equation gives $x - 1 = 1 - 2\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + (\\sqrt[3]{2 - x})^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify and rearrange the equation\nSimplifying and rearranging the terms gives $x - 2 = -2\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + (2 - x)^{2/3}$. Further simplification leads to $x - 2 = (2 - x)^{2/3} - 2(2 - x)^{1/3}$.\n\n## Step 6: Make a substitution to simplify the equation\nLet's make a substitution $y = (2 - x)^{1/3}$, which implies $y^3 = 2 - x$ and thus $x = 2 - y^3$. Substituting into the equation yields $2 - y^3 - 2 = y^2 - 2y$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the equation after substitution\nSimplifying the equation gives $-y^3 = y^2 - 2y$, which can be further rearranged to $y^3 + y^2 - 2y = 0$.\n\n## Step 8: Factor out common terms\nFactoring out $y$ gives $y(y^2 + y - 2) = 0$, and factoring the quadratic inside the parentheses yields $y(y + 2)(y - 1) = 0$.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for y\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions $y = 0$, $y = -2$, and $y = 1$.\n\n## Step 10: Back-substitute to find x\nRecall that $y = (2 - x)^{1/3}$. So, for $y = 0$, we have $0 = (2 - x)^{1/3}$, which gives $x = 2$. For $y = -2$, we get $-2 = (2 - x)^{1/3}$, leading to $-8 = 2 - x$ and thus $x = 10$. For $y = 1$, we have $1 = (2 - x)^{1/3}$, resulting in $1 = 2 - x$ and hence $x = 1$.\n\n## Step 11: Check the solutions\nWe must check each solution in the original equation to ensure they are valid due to the steps involving squaring, which might introduce extraneous solutions.\n\n- For $x = 2$, $\\sqrt[3]{2 - 2} + \\sqrt{2 - 1} = 0 + 1 = 1$, which is valid.\n- For $x = 10$, $\\sqrt[3]{2 - 10} + \\sqrt{10 - 1} = \\sqrt[3]{-8} + \\sqrt{9} = -2 + 3 = 1$, which is valid.\n- For $x = 1$, $\\sqrt[3]{2 - 1} + \\sqrt{1 - 1} = \\sqrt[3]{1} + 0 = 1$, which is valid.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1,2,10}$",

This simplifies to $2 - x = 1 - 3\\sqrt{x - 1} + 3(x - 1) - (x - 1)\\sqrt{x - 1}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation after cubing both sides.\nSimplifying, we have $2 - x = 1 - 3\\sqrt{x - 1} + 3x - 3 - x\\sqrt{x - 1} + \\sqrt{x - 1}$. Further simplification gives $2 - x = 3x - 2 - 2\\sqrt{x - 1} - x\\sqrt{x - 1}$.\n\n## Step 5: Move all terms to one side and combine like terms.\nMoving all terms to one side gives $0 = 4x - 4 - 2\\sqrt{x - 1} - x\\sqrt{x - 1}$.
