    "## Step 1: Recall the definition of a geometric sequence\nA geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. In this case, the terms are $a_1,$ $a_2,$ and $a_3$, and the common ratio is $r$. Therefore, $a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r$ and $a_3 = a_2 \\cdot r = a_1 \\cdot r^2$.\n\n## Step 2: Express $a_2$ and $a_3$ in terms of $r$\nGiven $a_1 = 1$, we have $a_2 = 1 \\cdot r = r$ and $a_3 = 1 \\cdot r^2 = r^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute $a_2$ and $a_3$ into the expression $4a_2 + 5a_3$\nSubstituting the expressions for $a_2$ and $a_3$ from Step 2 into $4a_2 + 5a_3$ gives $4r + 5r^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the minimum value of $4r + 5r^2$\nTo find the minimum value of the quadratic expression $4r + 5r^2$, we complete the square or use calculus. The expression can be rewritten as $5(r^2 + \\frac{4}{5}r)$. Completing the square gives $5((r + \\frac{2}{5})^2 - \\frac{4}{25}) = 5(r + \\frac{2}{5})^2 - \\frac{4}{5}$. The minimum value occurs when $r + \\frac{2}{5} = 0$, or $r = -\\frac{2}{5}$. However, we are interested in the value of the expression at this minimum, which is $-\\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}}$",
