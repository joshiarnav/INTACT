    "## Step 1: Start by assuming the given expression can be simplified into the form $a-b\\sqrt{3}$.\nWe assume $\\sqrt{37-20\\sqrt{3}} = a-b\\sqrt{3}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers.\n\n## Step 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\nSquaring both sides gives us $37-20\\sqrt{3} = (a-b\\sqrt{3})^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Expand the squared expression on the right side.\nExpanding the right side gives $37-20\\sqrt{3} = a^2 - 2ab\\sqrt{3} + 3b^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Equate the coefficients of the $\\sqrt{3}$ terms and the constant terms separately.\nFrom the equation, we get two separate equations: $37 = a^2 + 3b^2$ and $-20\\sqrt{3} = -2ab\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the equation $-20\\sqrt{3} = -2ab\\sqrt{3}$ for $ab$.\nDividing both sides by $-2\\sqrt{3}$ gives us $ab = 10$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the system of equations $37 = a^2 + 3b^2$ and $ab = 10$.\nSince $ab = 10$, we can try integer pairs that multiply to 10 and see which pair satisfies $37 = a^2 + 3b^2$.\n\n## Step 7: Test possible integer pairs for $(a, b)$ that satisfy both $ab = 10$ and $37 = a^2 + 3b^2$.\nPossible pairs are $(1, 10)$, $(10, 1)$, $(2, 5)$, and $(5, 2)$. We test these pairs in the equation $37 = a^2 + 3b^2$.\n\n## Step 8: Check the pair $(5, 2)$.\nPlugging in $a = 5$ and $b = 2$ into $37 = a^2 + 3b^2$ gives $37 = 5^2 + 3(2)^2 = 25 + 12 = 37$, which matches.\n\n## Step 9: Confirm that the pair $(5, 2)$ satisfies the condition and write the simplified expression.\nSince $(5, 2)$ satisfies both conditions, we have $\\sqrt{37-20\\sqrt{3}} = 5-2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5-2\\sqrt{3}}$",
