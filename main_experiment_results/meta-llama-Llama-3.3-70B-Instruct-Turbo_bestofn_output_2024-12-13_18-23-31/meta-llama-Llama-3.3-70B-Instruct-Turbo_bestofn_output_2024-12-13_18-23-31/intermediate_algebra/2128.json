    "## Step 1: Recall the properties of hyperbola asymptotes\nThe asymptotes of a hyperbola intersect at its center. Since the foci have the same x-coordinate, the hyperbola is vertical, and its asymptotes have equations of the form $y = mx + b$ and $y = -mx + b'$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ and $b'$ are the y-intercepts.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the slope of the other asymptote\nGiven that one of the asymptotes has the equation $y = 3x$, its slope is $3$. The slopes of the asymptotes of a hyperbola are negatives of each other. Therefore, the slope of the other asymptote is $-3$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the equation of the line passing through the center of the hyperbola\nThe center of the hyperbola lies on both asymptotes. Since the foci have the same x-coordinate, which is $5$, the center must also lie on the line $x = 5$. To find the y-coordinate of the center, we substitute $x = 5$ into the equation of the given asymptote $y = 3x$ to get $y = 3(5) = 15$. Thus, the center of the hyperbola is $(5, 15)$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the point-slope form to find the equation of the other asymptote\nUsing the point-slope form $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is the center $(5, 15)$ and $m$ is the slope $-3$, we can write the equation of the other asymptote as $y - 15 = -3(x - 5)$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the equation of the other asymptote\nSimplifying the equation $y - 15 = -3(x - 5)$ gives $y - 15 = -3x + 15$, which further simplifies to $y = -3x + 30$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the properties of a hyperbola and its asymptotes.\nA hyperbola is defined as the set of all points such that the absolute value of the difference between the distances from two fixed points (foci) is constant. The asymptotes of a hyperbola intersect at its center and are symmetric with respect to the center.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize the implications of the foci having the same x-coordinate.\nSince the foci have the same x-coordinate, the hyperbola is vertical (its transverse axis is vertical), and its center lies on the line x = 5.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the slope of the given asymptote and the implications for the other asymptote.\nThe given asymptote has the equation y = 3x, which means it has a slope of 3. Because the asymptotes of a hyperbola are symmetric with respect to the center, the other asymptote must have a slope of -3 (the negative reciprocal is not required here since the asymptotes are not perpendicular; they are symmetric with respect to the center).\n\n## Step 4: Use the point-slope formula to find the equation of the other asymptote.\nThe point-slope formula is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line. We know the slope (m = -3) and that the line passes through the center of the hyperbola, which lies on the line x = 5. Since the given asymptote y = 3x passes through the center, we can find the y-coordinate of the center by substituting x = 5 into y = 3x, which gives y = 3*5 = 15. Therefore, the center of the hyperbola is (5, 15).\n\n## Step 5: Apply the point-slope formula with the known point and slope.\nSubstituting the known values into the point-slope formula: y - 15 = -3(x - 5).\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the equation to the form y = mx + b.\nExpanding the equation: y - 15 = -3x + 15. Adding 15 to both sides: y = -3x + 30.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}$",

The asymptotes of a vertical hyperbola have slopes $m$ and $-m$. We are given that one asymptote has the equation $y = 3x$. This means that the slope of this asymptote is $3$. Therefore, the slope of the other asymptote must be $-3$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the equation of the other asymptote\nThe center of the hyperbola lies on both asymptotes. Since the foci have the same $x-$coordinate $5$, the center must also lie on the line $x = 5$. To find the $y-$coordinate of the center, we can substitute $x = 5$ into the equation of the given asymptote: $y = 3 \\cdot 5 = 15$. Thus, the center of the hyperbola is $(5, 15)$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the point-slope form to find the equation of the other asymptote\nUsing the point-slope form of a line $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope, we can find the equation of the other asymptote. The point is the center $(5, 15)$, and the slope is $-3$. Substituting these values into the point-slope form, we get $y - 15 = -3(x - 5)$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation $y - 15 = -3(x - 5)$, we have $y - 15 = -3x + 15$, which simplifies to $y = -3x + 30$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}$"

  "solution": "Because the foci both lie on the line $x=5$ and the center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the segment connecting the foci, the center must also lie on the line $x=5.$ However, we also know that the asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at the center. Therefore, the center of the hyperbola lies on both the line $x=5$ and the line $y=3x,$ so its coordinates are $(5, 15).$\n\nBecause the hyperbola has a horizontal axis, the other asymptote must have slope $-3.$ Therefore, we can write a point-slope equation for the other asymptote: \\[y - 15 = -3(x - 5),\\]which is equivalent to $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}.$",
