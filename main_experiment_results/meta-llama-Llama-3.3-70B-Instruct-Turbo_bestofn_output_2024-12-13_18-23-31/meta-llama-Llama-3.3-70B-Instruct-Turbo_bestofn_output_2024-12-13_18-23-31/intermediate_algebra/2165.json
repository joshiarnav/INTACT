    "## Step 1: To find the remainder when a polynomial is divided by another polynomial, we can use polynomial long division or the Remainder Theorem.\nThe Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of the division of a polynomial f(x) by a divisor of the form (x - c) is just f(c). However, since our divisor is 2x - 6, we first need to rewrite it in the form (x - c), which gives us 2(x - 3). Thus, we are interested in finding f(3) because the divisor is equivalent to x - 3 when we factor out the coefficient of x.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Remainder Theorem by substituting x = 3 into the polynomial $6x^4-14x^3-4x^2+2x-26$.\nWe calculate $6(3)^4 - 14(3)^3 - 4(3)^2 + 2(3) - 26$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate each term separately.\n- $6(3)^4 = 6 * 81 = 486$\n- $14(3)^3 = 14 * 27 = 378$\n- $4(3)^2 = 4 * 9 = 36$\n- $2(3) = 6$\n- The constant term is -26.\n\n## Step 4: Combine the calculated terms to find the remainder.\n$486 - 378 - 36 + 6 - 26 = 52$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{52}$",
    "## Step 1: To find the remainder of the division of a polynomial by another polynomial of the form (x - a) or (2x - 6) in this case, we can use the Remainder Theorem.\nThe Remainder Theorem tells us that the remainder of the division of a polynomial f(x) by a divisor of the form (x - a) is just f(a).

    "## Step 1: To find the remainder of a polynomial divided by another polynomial, we can use polynomial long division or synthetic division. However, since we are dividing by a linear polynomial $2x - 6$, we can also directly apply the Remainder Theorem.\nThe Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of the division of a polynomial $f(x)$ by a divisor of the form $(x - c)$ is just $f(c)$. In this case, our divisor is $2x - 6$, which we can rearrange to look like $(x - c)$ by factoring out 2, giving us $2(x - 3)$. Thus, $c = 3$.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute $x = 3$ into the polynomial $6x^4-14x^3-4x^2+2x-26$ to find the remainder.\nUsing $x = 3$, the polynomial becomes $6(3)^4 - 14(3)^3 - 4(3)^2 + 2(3) - 26$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the value of the polynomial at $x = 3$.\nFirst, calculate the powers of 3: $(3)^4 = 81$, $(3)^3 = 27$, and $(3)^2 = 9$.\nThen, substitute these values into the polynomial: $6(81) - 14(27) - 4(9) + 2(3) - 26$.\nPerform the multiplication: $486 - 378 - 36 + 6 - 26$.\n\n## Step 4: Complete the arithmetic to find the remainder.\nAdd and subtract the numbers in the order given: $486 - 378 = 108$, then $108 - 36 = 72$, next $72 + 6 = 78$, and finally $78 - 26 = 52$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{52}$"
