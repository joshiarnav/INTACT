    "## Step 1: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality\nThe Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality states that for any vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ in an inner product space, we have\n\\[\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i^2 \\right).\\]\nIn our case, we can rewrite the expression as\n\\[\\frac{x + 2y + 3}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + 1}} = \\frac{(x)(1) + (y)(2) + (1)(3)}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + 1}}.\\]\nLet $\\mathbf{a} = (x, y, 1)$ and $\\mathbf{b} = (1, 2, 3).$ Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we have\n\\[(x + 2y + 3)^2 \\leq (x^2 + y^2 + 1)(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2) = (x^2 + y^2 + 1)(14).\\]\n\n## Step 2: Derive the Maximum Value\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get\n\\[\\frac{x + 2y + 3}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + 1}} \\leq \\sqrt{14}.\\]\nThis means the maximum value of the expression is $\\sqrt{14}.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{14}}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the goal\nThe goal is to find the maximum value of the given expression over all real numbers $x$ and $y$. The expression involves a fraction with a numerator that is a linear combination of $x$ and $y$, and a denominator that is the square root of a quadratic expression in $x$ and $y$.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize the potential application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality\nThe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is a fundamental inequality in mathematics that states that for any vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ in an inner product space, the following inequality holds: $(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b})^2 \\leq (\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{a})(\\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{b})$. This can be extended to real numbers as well, where it can be applied to expressions involving sums of products.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality\nIn this case, we can treat $x$, $y$, and $1$ as the components of vector $\\mathbf{a}$, and $1$, $2$, and $3$ as the components of vector $\\mathbf{b}$. Applying Cauchy-Schwarz, we get: $(1 \\cdot x + 2 \\cdot y + 3 \\cdot 1)^2 \\leq (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2)(x^2 + y^2 + 1)$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the inequality from Cauchy-Schwarz\nSimplifying, we have: $(x + 2y + 3)^2 \\leq (14)(x^2 + y^2 + 1)$.\n\n## Step 5: Relate the inequality to the original expression\nTaking the square root of both sides of the inequality and rearranging gives: $\\frac{x + 2y + 3}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + 1}} \\leq \\sqrt{14}$.\n\n## Step 6: Identify when equality occurs\nEquality in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality occurs when the two vectors are linearly dependent, i.e., one vector is a scalar multiple of the other. For our purposes, this means $x = k \\cdot 1$, $y = k \\cdot 2$, and $1 = k \\cdot 3$, where $k$ is a scalar. Solving these equations simultaneously will give us the values of $x$ and $y$ for which the maximum is achieved.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $x$ and $y$ when equality occurs\nFrom $1 = k \\cdot 3$, we find $k = \\frac{1}{3}$. Then, $x = \\frac{1}{3}$ and $y = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n## Step 8: Conclude the maximum value\nTherefore, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $x = \\frac{1}{3}$ and $y = \\frac{2}{3}$, and this maximum value is $\\sqrt{14}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{14}}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the goal\nThe goal is to find the maximum value of the expression $\\frac{x + 2y + 3}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + 1}}$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize the structure of the expression\nThe expression has a numerator that is a linear combination of $x$, $y$, and a constant, and a denominator that is the square root of a sum of squares of $x$, $y$, and 1. This structure suggests the use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which relates inner products in Euclidean space to norms.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality\nThe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ in an inner product space, the inequality $|\\langle \\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b} \\rangle|^2 \\leq \\langle \\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{a} \\rangle \\cdot \\langle \\mathbf{b}, \\mathbf{b} \\rangle$ holds. In the context of this problem, we can consider $\\mathbf{a} = (x, y, 1)$ and $\\mathbf{b} = (1, 2, 3)$, so the inequality becomes $(x + 2y + 3)^2 \\leq (x^2 + y^2 + 1)(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2)$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the inequality from Cauchy-Schwarz\nSimplifying, we get $(x + 2y + 3)^2 \\leq (x^2 + y^2 + 1)(14)$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $|x + 2y + 3| \\leq \\sqrt{14} \\cdot \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + 1}$, and since we're interested in the maximum value of $\\frac{x + 2y + 3}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + 1}}$, we consider the case where $x + 2y + 3$ is positive, yielding $\\frac{x + 2y + 3}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + 1}} \\leq \\sqrt{14}$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine when equality occurs\nEquality in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality occurs when $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ are linearly dependent, i.e., one is a scalar multiple of the other. For our vectors $\\mathbf{a} = (x, y, 1)$ and $\\mathbf{b} = (1, 2, 3)$, this means $(x, y, 1) = c(1, 2, 3)$ for some scalar $c$. Thus, $x = c$, $y = 2c$, and $1 = 3c$, giving $c = \\frac{1}{3}$, $x = \\frac{1}{3}$, and $y = \\frac{2}{3}$. This shows that the maximum value can be achieved.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{14}}$"
