    "## Step 1: Factor out x^6 from the equation\nFactoring out $x^6$ from the given equation yields $x^6(x^4+7x^3+14x^2+1729x-1379)=0$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the solutions for the first part of the equation\nFor the equation $x^6=0$, the only solution is $x=0$. However, since we are looking for positive real solutions, $x=0$ is not a valid solution in this context.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the second part of the equation\nWe now focus on the equation $x^4+7x^3+14x^2+1729x-1379=0$. To find positive real solutions, we need to consider the behavior of this polynomial.\n\n## Step 4: Apply Descartes' Rule of Signs\nAccording to Descartes' Rule of Signs, the number of positive real roots in a polynomial is either equal to the number of sign changes in the coefficients of the polynomial or less than that by a positive even integer. In the polynomial $x^4+7x^3+14x^2+1729x-1379=0$, there is 1 sign change (from positive to negative), which means there is exactly 1 positive real root.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

    "## Step 1: Factor out the common term\nWe can start by factoring out $x^6$ from the equation, as it is common to all terms. This gives us $x^6(x^4+7x^3+14x^2+1729x-1379)=0$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the solutions for the first factor\nFrom the factored form, it's clear that if $x^6=0$, then $x=0$. However, since we are looking for positive real solutions, $x=0$ is not a valid solution for our case.\n\n## Step 3: Focus on the second factor for positive real solutions\nWe now focus on the equation $x^4+7x^3+14x^2+1729x-1379=0$ for positive real solutions.\n\n## Step 4: Apply Descartes' Rule of Signs\nDescartes' Rule of Signs states that the number of positive real roots in a polynomial equation is either equal to the number of sign changes in the coefficients of the polynomial or less than that by a positive even integer.

  "solution": "We can factor the equation as\n\\[x^6 (x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379) = 0.\\]Since we are looking for positive real solutions, this reduces to\n\\[x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379.\\]Consider the function $f(x) = x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379.$  This is increasing for $x > 0.$  Also, $f(0) < 0$ and $f(1) > 0,$ so there is exactly $\\boxed{1}$ positive real solution, which lies in the interval $(0,1).$",
