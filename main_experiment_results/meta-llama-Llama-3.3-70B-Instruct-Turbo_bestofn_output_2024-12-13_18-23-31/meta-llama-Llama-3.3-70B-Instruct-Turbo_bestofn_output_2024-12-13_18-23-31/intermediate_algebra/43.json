    "## Step 1: Understand the given function and conditions\nThe function $f$ is defined as $f(z) = i\\overline{z}$, where $z$ is a complex number and $\\overline{z}$ is its complex conjugate. We need to find the values of $z$ that satisfy both $|z| = 5$ and $f(z) = z$.\n\n## Step 2: Express $z$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts\nLet $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. The complex conjugate of $z$ is $\\overline{z} = a - bi$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the function $f(z)$ to $z = a + bi$\nUsing the definition of $f(z)$, we have $f(z) = i\\overline{z} = i(a - bi) = ai - bi^2 = ai + b$, since $i^2 = -1$.\n\n## Step 4: Equate $f(z)$ to $z$ to find the relationship between $a$ and $b$\nGiven $f(z) = z$, we have $ai + b = a + bi$. This implies that $a = b$.\n\n## Step 5: Use the condition $|z| = 5$ to find the values of $a$ and $b$\nThe magnitude of $z$ is given by $|z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. Since $|z| = 5$, we have $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 5$, which gives $a^2 + b^2 = 25$. Since $a = b$ from Step 4, we can substitute $b$ with $a$ to get $a^2 + a^2 = 25$, or $2a^2 = 25$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $a$\nSolving the equation $2a^2 = 25$ gives $a^2 = \\frac{25}{2}$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $a = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{25}{2}} = \\pm\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\pm\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Since $a = b$, $b$ will also have the same values.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the number of solutions for $z$\nGiven that $a = b$ and $a$ can be either $\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ or $-\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, there are two possible combinations for $z$: $z = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}i$ and $z = -\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}i$. Thus, there are two values of $z$ that satisfy both conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

The complex conjugate of $z$ is $\\overline{z} = x - yi$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the function $f(z)$ to $z = x + yi$\nSubstituting $z = x + yi$ into the function $f(z) = i\\overline{z}$ gives $f(z) = i(x - yi) = ix + y$.\n\n## Step 4: Equate $f(z)$ to $z$ to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$\nSince $f(z) = z$, we have $ix + y = x + yi$. This implies that $ix = yi$ and $y = x$, or $x = y$ after dividing both sides by $i$ and using $i^2 = -1$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the condition $|z| = 5$ to $z = x + yi$\nGiven $|z| = 5$, we have $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 5$.
