    "## Step 1: Apply the Remainder Theorem for the division by $x - 1$\nAccording to the Remainder Theorem, if a polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by $x - c$, the remainder is $f(c)$. Therefore, when $f(x)$ is divided by $x - 1$, we substitute $x = 1$ into the polynomial to find the remainder. So, $f(1) = a(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + b(1) - 5 = a - 6 + b - 5 = a + b - 11$. We are given that this remainder is $-5$, so we have the equation $a + b - 11 = -5$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Remainder Theorem for the division by $x + 2$\nSimilarly, when $f(x)$ is divided by $x + 2$, we substitute $x = -2$ into the polynomial. So, $f(-2) = a(-2)^3 - 6(-2)^2 + b(-2) - 5 = -8a - 24 - 2b - 5 = -8a - 2b - 29$. We are given that this remainder is $-53$, so we have the equation $-8a - 2b - 29 = -53$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equations from Step 1 and Step 2\nFrom Step 1, we have $a + b - 11 = -5$, which simplifies to $a + b = 6$.\nFrom Step 2, we have $-8a - 2b - 29 = -53$, which simplifies to $-8a - 2b = -24$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the system of equations\nWe can solve the system of equations $a + b = 6$ and $-8a - 2b = -24$.\nFirst, let's simplify the second equation by dividing everything by $-2$, which gives us $4a + b = 12$.\nNow, we subtract the first equation from this new form of the second equation: $(4a + b) - (a + b) = 12 - 6$, which simplifies to $3a = 6$, and thus $a = 2$.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute $a = 2$ back into one of the original equations to solve for $b$\nUsing $a + b = 6$ and substituting $a = 2$, we get $2 + b = 6$, which simplifies to $b = 4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(2,4)}$",

We can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of $b$ in both equations equal:\n$2(a + b) = 2(6)$, which gives $2a + 2b = 12$.\n\nNow, we have:\n1. $2a + 2b = 12$\n2. $-8a - 2b = -24$\n\nAdding both equations to eliminate $b$:\n$(2a - 8a) + (2b - 2b) = 12 - 24$, which simplifies to $-6a = -12$.\n\nSolving for $a$:\n$a = 2$\n\n## Step 5: Substitute $a$ back into one of the original equations to solve for $b$\nSubstituting $a = 2$ into $a + b = 6$:\n$2 + b = 6$, which simplifies to $b = 4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(2, 4)}$"
