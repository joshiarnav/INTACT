    "## Step 1: We are given the function $f(x) = 4x^5 + 5x^{-4}$ and we are asked to find the minimum value of this function for a positive real number $x$.\nTo find the minimum value, we can use calculus, specifically the derivative of the function.\n\n## Step 2: Let's find the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$.\nUsing the power rule, the derivative of $4x^5$ is $20x^4$ and the derivative of $5x^{-4}$ is $-20x^{-5}$.\nSo, $f'(x) = 20x^4 - 20x^{-5}$.\n\n## Step 3: To find the critical points, we need to set $f'(x)$ equal to zero and solve for $x$.\n$20x^4 - 20x^{-5} = 0$.\n$20x^4 = 20x^{-5}$.\n$x^4 = x^{-5}$.\n$x^9 = 1$.\nSince $x$ is a positive real number, $x = 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Now, we need to check if $x = 1$ corresponds to a minimum value.\nWe can use the second derivative test.\nThe second derivative of $f(x)$ is $f''(x) = 80x^3 + 100x^{-6}$.\nEvaluating $f''(x)$ at $x = 1$, we get $f''(1) = 80 + 100 > 0$.\nSince $f''(1) > 0$, $x = 1$ corresponds to a minimum value.\n\n## Step 5: Finally, we need to find the minimum value of $f(x)$.\nWe substitute $x = 1$ into the original function: $f(1) = 4(1)^5 + 5(1)^{-4}$.\n$f(1) = 4 + 5 = 9$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",
