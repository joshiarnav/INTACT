    "## Step 1: Understand the given sequence and its properties.\nThe sequence is defined by the relation $a_n = a_{n - 1} a_{n + 1}$ for all $n \\ge 2.$ This implies that each term is the product of the preceding and following terms.\n\n## Step 2: Rewrite the given relation to express $a_{n+1}$ in terms of $a_n$ and $a_{n-1}$.\nRearranging the given equation, we get $a_{n + 1} = \\frac{a_n}{a_{n - 1}}$ for $n \\ge 2.$ This provides a way to calculate the next term in the sequence if the previous two terms are known.\n\n## Step 3: Use the given values to calculate the next terms in the sequence and look for a pattern.\nGiven $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$ and $a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7},$ we can start calculating terms around $a_{1776}$ to identify any patterns or periodicity in the sequence.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $a_2$ using $a_1$ and the relation $a_{n+1} = \\frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}}$.\nSince $a_2 = \\frac{a_1}{a_0}$ and $a_0$ is not directly given, we cannot calculate $a_2$ directly from the information provided. Instead, we'll use the given relation to find a pattern or use the provided terms to deduce properties of the sequence.\n\n## Step 5: Observe the pattern and periodicity of the sequence.\nLet's calculate a few terms around $a_{1776}$ and observe any recurring patterns. Given the nature of the sequence, it might exhibit periodic behavior after a certain number of terms.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the periodicity of the sequence.\nBy analyzing the relation $a_{n + 1} = \\frac{a_n}{a_{n - 1}},$ we notice that if $a_{n-1} = a_{n+1},$ then $a_n = 1$ or the sequence could become periodic with a period related to the initial conditions.\n\n## Step 7: Use the given $a_{1776}$ to find a pattern or relation that could help in finding $a_{2009}$.\nSince $a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$ and knowing that the sequence might exhibit periodic behavior, let's consider how the terms might repeat or relate to each other over a certain period.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate $a_{2009}$ based on observed patterns or periodicity.\nGiven the potential periodicity of the sequence and the specific values provided, we aim to find a relation or pattern that allows us to calculate $a_{2009}$ using $a_{1776}$ and $a_1$.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the relation between terms and how they might cycle or depend on initial conditions.\nGiven $a_{n+1} = \\frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}},$ if the sequence becomes periodic after a certain point, the period and the values within that period would depend on the initial conditions $a_1$ and potentially $a_2$.\n\n## Step 10: Solve for $a_{2009}$ using identified patterns or sequence properties.\nTo solve for $a_{2009}$, we need to understand how the sequence evolves from $a_1$ to $a_{1776}$ and then to $a_{2009}$, considering any periodic behavior or specific patterns that emerge due to the sequence's definition.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{13 + \\sqrt{7}}{1 + \\sqrt{7}} = \\frac{13 + \\sqrt{7}}{1 + \\sqrt{7}} \\cdot \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{7}}{1 - \\sqrt{7}} = \\frac{13 - 13\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{7} - 7}{1 - 7} = \\frac{6 - 12\\sqrt{7}}{-6} = -1 + 2\\sqrt{7}}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given sequence\nWe are given a sequence of real numbers $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $a_3,$ $\\dots$ that satisfies the equation $a_n = a_{n - 1} a_{n + 1}$ for all $n \\ge 2$. This equation can be rearranged to $a_{n + 1} = \\frac{a_n}{a_{n - 1}}$.\n\n## Step 2: Express $a_{n+1}$ in terms of $a_{n-1}$ and $a_n$\nFrom the given equation, we find that $a_{n + 1} = \\frac{a_n}{a_{n - 1}}$. We can use this recursive relation to find the pattern in the sequence.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the first few terms to identify a pattern\nWe start with $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$. To find $a_2$, we need $a_3$. However, we can express $a_3$ in terms of $a_2$ and $a_1$. Let's proceed with finding $a_2$ and $a_3$ to see if there's a recurring pattern.\n\n## Step 4: Derive $a_2$ and $a_3$ using the recursive relation\nSince $a_{n+1} = \\frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}}$, let $n = 2$ to get $a_3 = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$. For $n = 3$, $a_4 = \\frac{a_3}{a_2}$. Substituting $a_3$ from the previous equation, we get $a_4 = \\frac{1}{a_1}$. Given $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$, $a_4 = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sqrt{7}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify $a_4$ to identify any pattern or repetition\nTo simplify $\\frac{1}{1 + \\sqrt{7}}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator: $\\frac{1}{1 + \\sqrt{7}} \\cdot \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{7}}{1 - \\sqrt{7}} = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{7}}{1 - 7} = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{7}}{-6} = \\frac{\\sqrt{7} - 1}{6}$.\n\n## Step 6: Establish the periodic nature of the sequence\nNotice that $a_4 = \\frac{\\sqrt{7} - 1}{6}$. If we continue this process, we'll find that the sequence becomes periodic with a period of 6, because $a_7 = a_1$, $a_8 = a_2$, and so on, due to the nature of the recurrence relation.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the position of $a_{2009}$ in the sequence's period\nGiven that the sequence has a period of 6, we divide 2009 by 6 to find the remainder, which tells us where $a_{2009}$ falls within the period. $2009 \\mod 6 = 5$, meaning $a_{2009}$ corresponds to $a_5$ in the sequence's period.\n\n## Step 8: Find $a_5$ using the periodic pattern and given values\nSince $a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$, and knowing the sequence's periodic nature, we can find $a_5$. Given $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$ and the periodicity, we need to relate $a_{1776}$ to $a_5$ or $a_6$ to use the given information effectively.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate $a_5$ or $a_6$ to determine $a_{2009}$\nSince $a_{1776}$ corresponds to $a_6$ in the period (as $1776 \\mod 6 = 0$), and we know $a_6 = \\frac{1}{a_1}$, we can then use the periodicity and given values to find $a_5$ and thus $a_{2009}$.\n\n## Step 10: Apply the periodicity to find $a_{2009}$\nGiven that $a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$ and it corresponds to $a_6$ in the sequence, and knowing $a_6 = \\frac{1}{a_1}$, we see that $a_5$ would be $a_{1775}$ in the sequence, which is $\\frac{a_6}{a_7} = \\frac{a_6}{a_1}$. Since $a_6 = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$ and $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$, $a_5 = \\frac{13 + \\sqrt{7}}{1 + \\sqrt{7}}$. Simplifying, $a_5 = \\frac{(13 + \\sqrt{7})(\\sqrt{7} - 1)}{(1 + \\sqrt{7})(\\sqrt{7} - 1)} = \\frac{13\\sqrt{7} - 13 + 7 - \\sqrt{7}}{7 - 1} = \\frac{12\\sqrt{7} - 6}{6} = 2\\sqrt{7} - 1$. Thus, $a_{2009} = a_5 = 2\\sqrt{7} - 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-1+2\\sqrt{7}}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given sequence\nThe sequence of real numbers is defined by the recursion $a_n = a_{n - 1} a_{n + 1}$ for all $n \\ge 2.$ This means that each term in the sequence is the product of the previous term and the next term.\n\n## Step 2: Rearrange the given recursion\nWe can rearrange the given recursion to get $a_{n + 1} = \\frac{a_n}{a_{n - 1}}.$ This will help us find a pattern in the sequence.\n\n## Step 3: Find the pattern in the sequence\nLet's calculate a few terms to see if there is a pattern. We have $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$ and $a_2 = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\cdot a_3.$ Using the recursion, we find $a_3 = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}.$ Then, $a_4 = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\frac{1}{a_1}.$ Continuing this pattern, we get $a_5 = \\frac{a_4}{a_3} = \\frac{1}{a_2},$ $a_6 = \\frac{a_5}{a_4} = a_1,$ and $a_7 = \\frac{a_6}{a_5} = a_2.$ We notice that the sequence is periodic with period 6, and the terms repeat in the following order: $a_1, a_2, \\frac{a_2}{a_1}, \\frac{1}{a_1}, \\frac{1}{a_2}, a_1.$\n\n## Step 4: Determine the value of $a_2$\nSince the sequence has a period of 6, we can use the given values of $a_1$ and $a_{1776}$ to find $a_2$. We know that $1776 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{6},$ so $a_6 = a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7}.$ Since $a_6 = a_1,$ we have $a_1 = 13 + \\sqrt{7}.$ However, this is not the case, as we are given $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}.$ Therefore, we must find $a_2$ using a different method.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $a_2$ using $a_1$ and $a_7$\nSince $a_7 = a_2$ and $a_7 = \\frac{a_6}{a_5} = \\frac{a_1}{a_5},$ and $a_5 = \\frac{1}{a_2},$ we have $a_2 = \\frac{a_1}{\\frac{1}{a_2}} = a_1 \\cdot a_2.$ Thus, $a_2 = \\frac{a_1}{1 - a_1} = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{7}}{1 - (1 + \\sqrt{7})} = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{7}}{- \\sqrt{7}} = - \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{7}}{\\sqrt{7}} = - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}} - 1 = -1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{\\sqrt{7}} = -1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{7}.$ However, the problem doesn't require us to explicitly calculate $a_2$ to find $a_{2009}$. The periodicity of the sequence allows us to relate $a_{2009}$ directly to $a_5$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine $a_{2009}$\nSince $2009 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{6},$ we have $a_{2009} = a_5 = \\frac{1}{a_2}.$ But to find $a_{2009}$ in terms of given values, we notice that $a_{1776} = a_6 = a_1$ in the periodic sequence, but given $a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7},$ it indicates $a_6$ of the repeating pattern is actually $a_{1776},$ and since the sequence repeats every 6 terms, $a_{2009}$ would correspond to $a_5$ in the repeating pattern. Given that $a_6 = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$ and using the relation $a_5 = \\frac{1}{a_2}$ and $a_6 = a_1,$ we should look for a pattern or relation that can help determine $a_{2009}$ based on given information without explicitly calculating $a_2$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate $a_{2009}$ based on the periodicity and given information\nFrom the periodic nature, $a_{2009} = a_5.$ Since $a_5 = \\frac{1}{a_2}$ and $a_6 = a_1,$ and given $a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7},$ we need a direct relation between $a_1, a_6,$ and $a_5$ or $a_2$ to solve for $a_{2009}$. Knowing $a_{1776}$ is equivalent to $a_6$ in the pattern, and $a_6$ is also $a_1$ in the repeating sequence, but given as $13 + \\sqrt{7}$, we must utilize the periodicity and given values to deduce $a_{2009}$ without explicitly solving for $a_2$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $a_{2009}$ using the relation between terms\nSince $a_{2009}$ corresponds to $a_5$ and $a_5 = \\frac{1}{a_2},$ we need to establish a direct relationship or utilize the periodicity and given terms to solve for $a_{2009}$. Given that $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$ and $a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7},$ and recognizing the sequence's periodic nature, we should observe that $a_{2009}$ is $a_5$ in the cycle. Since we have $a_6 = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$ and $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7},$ and knowing $a_5 = \\frac{1}{a_2},$ the relation between $a_1, a_2,$ and the subsequent terms will help determine $a_{2009}$. Considering the cycle, $a_5$ would be related to $a_1$ and $a_6$ through the periodicity and the nature of the sequence's definition.\n\n## Step 9: Establish the relation between $a_1, a_6,$ and $a_5$\nGiven $a_6 = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$ and $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7},$ and knowing the sequence repeats every 6 terms, the relationship between these terms can help determine $a_{2009}$. Since $a_5$ is the term before $a_6$ in the repeating pattern, and we know $a_6$ and $a_1$, we should utilize the nature of the sequence to find $a_5$ or $a_{2009}$.\n\n## Step 10: Determine $a_{2009}$ based on given values and sequence properties\nSince $a_{2009} = a_5$ and the sequence is periodic, knowing $a_1$ and $a_6$ allows us to deduce the value of $a_5$ or $a_{2009}$. We need to consider how $a_5$ relates to $a_1$ and $a_6$ within the sequence's periodic nature and use given information to calculate $a_{2009}$.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate $a_{2009}$ using given information and sequence properties\nSince we have $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$ and $a_6 = 13 + \\sqrt{7},$ we recognize $a_6$ as $a_1$ in the repeating sequence but with a different value due to the periodic nature. To find $a_{2009}$, which corresponds to $a_5$, we need to establish a direct or indirect relationship that incorporates the given values and the sequence's definition.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{-6 + 12 \\sqrt{7}}{6}}$"
