    "## Step 1: Recall the formula for calculating the distance of foci from the center in an ellipse and a hyperbola.\nFor an ellipse with the equation \\(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\), the distance of each focus from the center is given by \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}\\) when \\(a > b\\), or \\(c = \\sqrt{b^2 - a^2}\\) when \\(b > a\\). For a hyperbola with the equation \\(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\), the distance of each focus from the center is given by \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).\n\n## Step 2: Identify the type of conic sections and their respective foci distances.\nThe first equation \\(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\) represents an ellipse with foci at \\((0, \\pm 4)\\), which means \\(c = 4\\). The second equation \\(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\) represents a hyperbola with foci at \\((\\pm 6, 0)\\), which means \\(c = 6\\).\n\n## Step 3: Apply the formula for the ellipse to find a relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\nGiven that the foci of the ellipse are at \\((0, \\pm 4)\\), and assuming \\(a > b\\) (since the foci are on the y-axis), we have \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = 4\\). Thus, \\(a^2 - b^2 = 16\\).\n\n## Step 4: Apply the formula for the hyperbola to find another relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\nFor the hyperbola with foci at \\((\\pm 6, 0)\\), we have \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 6\\). Thus, \\(a^2 + b^2 = 36\\).\n\n## Step 5: Solve the system of equations derived from the relationships between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) for both the ellipse and the hyperbola.\nWe have two equations:\n1. \\(a^2 - b^2 = 16\\)\n2. \\(a^2 + b^2 = 36\\)\n\nAdding these two equations to eliminate \\(b^2\\), we get:\n\\[2a^2 = 52\\]\n\\[a^2 = 26\\]\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second to eliminate \\(a^2\\), we get:\n\\[2b^2 = 20\\]\n\\[b^2 = 10\\]\n\n## Step 6: Calculate \\(|ab|\\) using the values of \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\).\n\\[|ab| = \\sqrt{a^2 \\cdot b^2} = \\sqrt{26 \\cdot 10} = \\sqrt{260} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 65} = 2\\sqrt{65}\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{65}}$",
