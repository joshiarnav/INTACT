    "## Step 1: Understand the given equation\nWe are given the equation $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$. This equation represents the absolute value or modulus of a complex number. The absolute value of a complex number $a + bi$ is given by $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the absolute value formula to the given complex number\nFor the complex number $\\frac12 - ci$, the absolute value is $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + (-c)^2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the given condition\nWe have $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + (-c)^2} = \\frac34$. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root gives $\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + c^2 = \\left(\\frac34\\right)^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $c^2$\nSimplifying the equation from step 3: $\\frac14 + c^2 = \\frac{9}{16}$. Subtract $\\frac14$ from both sides to isolate $c^2$: $c^2 = \\frac{9}{16} - \\frac14$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the right side of the equation\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator: $c^2 = \\frac{9}{16} - \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{5}{16}$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $c$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives $c = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{16}}$. Therefore, $c = \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the number of real values of $c$\nSince $c$ can be either positive or negative $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}$, there are 2 real values of $c$ that satisfy the given equation.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"

  "solution": "We have $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\sqrt{{\\frac12}^2 + (-c)^2} = \\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14}$, so $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ gives us $\\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14} = \\frac34$.  Squaring both sides gives $c^2 + \\frac14 = \\frac9{16}$, so $c^2=\\frac5{16}$.  Taking the square root of both sides gives $c = \\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ and $c=-\\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ as solutions, so there are $\\boxed{2}$ real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nWe also could have solved this equation by noting that $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ means that the complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is $\\frac34$ units from the origin in the complex plane.  Therefore, it is on the circle centered at the origin with radius $\\frac34$.  The complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is also on the vertical line that intersects the real axis at $\\frac12$, which is inside the aforementioned circle.  Since this line goes inside the circle, it must intersect the circle at $\\boxed{2}$ points, which correspond to the values of $c$ that satisfy the original equation.",
