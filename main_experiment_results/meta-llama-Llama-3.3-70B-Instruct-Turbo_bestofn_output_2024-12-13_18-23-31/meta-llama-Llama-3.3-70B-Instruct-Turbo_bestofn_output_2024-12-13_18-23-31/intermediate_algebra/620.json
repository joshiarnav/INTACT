    "To find a quadratic function that meets the given criteria, we can start by using the fact that the function has zeros at $x=2$ and $x=4$. This means the function can be written in the form $f(x) = a(x-2)(x-4)$, where $a$ is a constant we need to determine.\n\nSince the function takes the value $6$ when $x=3$, we can substitute $x=3$ and $f(x)=6$ into the equation to solve for $a$:\n\n$$6 = a(3-2)(3-4)$$\n$$6 = a(1)(-1)$$\n$$6 = -a$$\n$$a = -6$$\n\nNow that we have found $a$, we can write the quadratic function as:\n$$f(x) = -6(x-2)(x-4)$$\n\nTo put this into the expanded form $ax^2 + bx + c$, we multiply out the terms:\n\n$$f(x) = -6(x^2 - 4x - 2x + 8)$$\n$$f(x) = -6(x^2 - 6x + 8)$$\n$$f(x) = -6x^2 + 36x - 48$$\n\nTherefore, the expanded form of the quadratic function is $\\boxed{-6x^2 + 36x - 48}$.",

  "solution": "An example of a quadratic function with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ is $(x-2)(x-4)$. However, when $x=3$, this function takes the value $-1$. However, multiplying the entire quadratic by $-6$ does not change the location of the zeroes, and does give us the desired value at $x=3$.\n\nThus, $-6(x-2)(x-4)$ has all the desired properties. The expanded form of this expression is $\\boxed{-6x^2+36x-48}$.\n\nNote that this is the only such quadratic. Any quadratic must factor as $a(x-r)(x-s)$, where its zeroes are $r$ and $s$; thus a quadratic with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ must be of the form $a(x-2)(x-4)$, and the coefficient $a=-6$ is forced by the value at $x=3$.",
