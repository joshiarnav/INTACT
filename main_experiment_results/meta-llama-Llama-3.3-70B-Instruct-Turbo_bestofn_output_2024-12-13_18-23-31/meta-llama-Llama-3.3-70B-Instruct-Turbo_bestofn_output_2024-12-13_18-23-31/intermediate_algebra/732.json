    "## Step 1: Determine the formula for the volume of the rectangular prism box.\nThe volume \\(V\\) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula \\(V = lwh\\), where \\(l\\) is the length, \\(w\\) is the width, and \\(h\\) is the height. For the given box, the volume formula becomes \\(V = (x+5)(x-5)(x^{2}+25)\\).\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the volume formula.\nSimplifying the expression \\((x+5)(x-5)(x^{2}+25)\\), we first notice that \\((x+5)(x-5) = x^{2} - 25\\). Thus, the volume formula simplifies to \\(V = (x^{2} - 25)(x^{2} + 25)\\).\n\n## Step 3: Further simplify the volume formula.\nRecognizing that \\((x^{2} - 25)(x^{2} + 25) = x^{4} - 625\\), the volume formula becomes \\(V = x^{4} - 625\\).\n\n## Step 4: Set up the inequality for the volume condition.\nWe are told that the volume of the box must be less than 700 units. Therefore, we set up the inequality \\(x^{4} - 625 < 700\\).\n\n## Step 5: Solve the inequality for \\(x^{4}\\).\nAdding 625 to both sides of the inequality gives \\(x^{4} < 1325\\).\n\n## Step 6: Find the fourth root of both sides of the inequality.\nTaking the fourth root of both sides gives \\(x < \\sqrt[4]{1325}\\).\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the fourth root of 1325.\nCalculating \\(\\sqrt[4]{1325}\\) gives approximately \\(6.88\\).\n\n## Step 8: Consider the constraints on \\(x\\) due to the dimensions of the box.\nGiven that the width is \\(x - 5\\) units, \\(x\\) must be greater than 5 to ensure a positive width.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the range of positive integer values of \\(x\\) that satisfy both the volume condition and the dimension constraints.\nSince \\(x < 6.88\\) and \\(x > 5\\), and considering \\(x\\) must be a positive integer, the possible values for \\(x\\) are 6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

  "solution": "To find the volume of the box, we multiply the three dimensions: $(x+5)(x-5)(x^{2}+25) = (x^{2}-25)(x^{2}+25) = x^{4}-625$. We want to find $x$ such that $x^{4}-625<700$, which simplifies to $x^{4}<1325$. Taking the fourth root shows us that $x$ is less than $\\sqrt[4]{1325}$, which is between 6 and 7 (since $6^4=1296$ while $7^4=2401$). So $x$ could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, we see that the width is $x-5$ units, and this must be a positive number, so the only value of $x$ which works is 6. Thus, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ possible value of $x$.",
