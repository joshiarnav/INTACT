    "## Step 1: Identify the formula for finding the midpoint of a line segment in the complex plane.\nThe midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $z_1 = a + bi$ and $z_2 = c + di$ can be found using the formula: $\\frac{z_1 + z_2}{2} = \\frac{(a + c) + (b + d)i}{2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the midpoint formula to the given endpoints.\nLet $z_1 = -11 + 3i$ and $z_2 = 3 - 7i$. Applying the formula: $\\frac{(-11 + 3i) + (3 - 7i)}{2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the addition inside the parentheses.\nAdding the real parts and the imaginary parts separately: $\\frac{(-11 + 3) + (3 - 7)i}{2} = \\frac{-8 - 4i}{2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Divide the result by 2 to find the midpoint.\nDividing both the real and imaginary parts by 2: $\\frac{-8}{2} - \\frac{4}{2}i = -4 - 2i$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-4 - 2i}$",

    "## Step 1: To find the mid-point of a line segment in the complex plane, we need to average the real parts and the imaginary parts of the end-points separately.\nThe formula to find the mid-point of two complex numbers $a + bi$ and $c + di$ is $\\frac{(a + c)}{2} + \\frac{(b + d)}{2}i$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the real and imaginary parts of the given end-points.\nFor the first point, $-11 + 3i$, the real part is $-11$ and the imaginary part is $3$.
