    "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nWe are given two circles defined by the equations $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ and $(x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 16$. We need to find the locus of the centers $(a,b)$ of all circles externally tangent to $C_1$ and internally tangent to $C_2$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the centers and radii of the given circles\nThe center of $C_1$ is $(0,0)$ and its radius is $1$. The center of $C_2$ is $(2,0)$ and its radius is $4$.\n\n## Step 3: Denote the center and radius of the desired circle\nLet the center of the desired circle be $(a,b)$ and its radius be $r$.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the condition of external tangency to $C_1$\nThe distance between the center of the desired circle and the center of $C_1$ is the sum of their radii, so we have $\\sqrt{(a-0)^2 + (b-0)^2} = r + 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the condition of internal tangency to $C_2$\nThe distance between the center of the desired circle and the center of $C_2$ is the difference of their radii, so we have $\\sqrt{(a-2)^2 + (b-0)^2} = 4 - r$.\n\n## Step 6: Square both equations to simplify\nSquaring both equations gives $a^2 + b^2 = (r+1)^2$ and $(a-2)^2 + b^2 = (4-r)^2$.\n\n## Step 7: Expand the squared equations\nExpanding the squared equations gives $a^2 + b^2 = r^2 + 2r + 1$ and $a^2 - 4a + 4 + b^2 = 16 - 8r + r^2$.\n\n## Step 8: Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $a^2$ and $b^2$\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation gives $-4a + 4 = 16 - 8r + r^2 - r^2 - 2r - 1$, which simplifies to $-4a + 4 = 15 - 10r$.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for $r$ in terms of $a$\nRearranging the equation gives $10r = 15 + 4a - 4$, so $r = \\frac{11 + 4a}{10}$.\n\n## Step 10: Substitute $r$ into one of the original equations to find the locus\nSubstituting $r$ into the equation $a^2 + b^2 = r^2 + 2r + 1$ gives $a^2 + b^2 = \\left(\\frac{11 + 4a}{10}\\right)^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{11 + 4a}{10}\\right) + 1$.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the equation to find the locus\nExpanding and simplifying the equation gives $a^2 + b^2 = \\frac{121 + 88a + 16a^2}{100} + \\frac{22 + 8a}{10} + 1$, which further simplifies to $a^2 + b^2 = \\frac{16a^2 + 88a + 121 + 220 + 80a + 100}{100}$.\n\n## Step 12: Combine like terms and multiply through by 100 to clear the fraction\nCombining like terms gives $a^2 + b^2 = \\frac{16a^2 + 168a + 441}{100}$, and multiplying through by 100 gives $100a^2 + 100b^2 = 16a^2 + 168a + 441$.\n\n## Step 13: Rearrange the equation into the standard form\nRearranging the equation gives $100a^2 - 16a^2 + 100b^2 - 168a - 441 = 0$, which simplifies to $84a^2 + 100b^2 - 168a - 441 = 0$.\n\n## Step 14: Ensure the equation is in the required format\nThe equation $84a^2 + 100b^2 - 168a - 441 = 0$ is already in the required format.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{84a^2 + 100b^2 - 168a - 441 = 0}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given equations of circles\nThe equation $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ represents a circle $C_1$ with center at $(0,0)$ and radius $1$. The equation $(x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 16$ represents a circle $C_2$ with center at $(2,0)$ and radius $4$.\n\n## Step 2: Denote the center of the desired circle\nLet's denote the center of the circle that is externally tangent to $C_1$ and internally tangent to $C_2$ as $(a,b)$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the distance formula to set up equations for tangency\nThe distance between the center of $C_1$ and the center of the desired circle is the sum of their radii, which we'll call $r$. This gives us the equation $\\sqrt{(a-0)^2 + (b-0)^2} = r + 1$. Similarly, the distance between the center of $C_2$ and the center of the desired circle is the difference of their radii, giving us $\\sqrt{(a-2)^2 + (b-0)^2} = |r - 4|$.\n\n## Step 4: Square both sides of the equations to simplify\nSquaring both sides of the first equation gives $a^2 + b^2 = (r + 1)^2$. Squaring both sides of the second equation gives $(a-2)^2 + b^2 = (r - 4)^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Expand the squared equations\nExpanding the first equation gives $a^2 + b^2 = r^2 + 2r + 1$. Expanding the second equation gives $a^2 - 4a + 4 + b^2 = r^2 - 8r + 16$.\n\n## Step 6: Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $a^2$ and $b^2$\nSubtracting the two equations gives $-4a + 4 = -10r + 15$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $r$ in terms of $a$\nRearranging the equation gives $10r = 4a - 11$, so $r = \\frac{4a - 11}{10}$.\n\n## Step 8: Substitute $r$ back into one of the original equations\nSubstituting $r = \\frac{4a - 11}{10}$ into $a^2 + b^2 = r^2 + 2r + 1$ gives $a^2 + b^2 = \\left(\\frac{4a - 11}{10}\\right)^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{4a - 11}{10}\\right) + 1$.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the equation\nExpanding the equation gives $a^2 + b^2 = \\frac{16a^2 - 88a + 121}{100} + \\frac{8a - 22}{10} + 1$. Simplifying further gives $a^2 + b^2 = \\frac{16a^2 - 88a + 121 + 80a - 220 + 100}{100}$. This reduces to $a^2 + b^2 = \\frac{16a^2 - 8a + 1}{100}$.\n\n## Step 10: Multiply the entire equation by 100 to get integer coefficients\nMultiplying by 100 gives $100a^2 + 100b^2 = 16a^2 - 8a + 1$. Rearranging gives $84a^2 + 100b^2 + 8a - 1 = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{84a^2 + 100b^2 + 8a - 1 = 0}$",
