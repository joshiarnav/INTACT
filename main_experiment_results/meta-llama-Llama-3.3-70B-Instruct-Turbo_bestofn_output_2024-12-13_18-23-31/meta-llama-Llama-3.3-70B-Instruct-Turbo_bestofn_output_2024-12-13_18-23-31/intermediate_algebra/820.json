    "## Step 1: Factor out the greatest common factor\nFirst, let's factor out the greatest common factor, which is $x$. This gives us $x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20)$.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the cubic expression\nNow, we need to factor the cubic expression $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$. We can try to factor this by finding a rational root. Possible rational roots are factors of 20 divided by factors of 6. By inspection or using synthetic division, we find that $x=1/2$ is a root, as $6(1/2)^3+19(1/2)^2-51(1/2)+20 = 0$. So, we can factor $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$ as $(2x-1)(3x^2+11x-20)$.\n\n## Step 3: Factor the quadratic expression\nNext, we factor the quadratic expression $3x^2+11x-20$. This can be factored as $(3x-4)(x+5)$.\n\n## Step 4: Write the complete factorization\nCombining all the steps, the complete factorization of the given polynomial is $x(2x-1)(3x-4)(x+5)$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the roots\nTo find the roots, we set each factor equal to zero. So, the roots are $x=0$, $x=1/2$, $x=4/3$, and $x=-5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0, 1/2, 4/3, -5}$",
    "## Step 1: Factor out the greatest common factor\nFirst, let's factor out the greatest common factor, which in this case is $x$. Factoring out $x$ gives us $x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20)$.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the cubic polynomial\nNow, let's try to factor the cubic polynomial $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$. Looking at the coefficients, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem, which suggests possible roots as factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Rational Root Theorem\nThe constant term is 20, and its factors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm5, \\pm10, \\pm20$. The leading coefficient is 6, and its factors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm3, \\pm6$. Therefore, the possible rational roots are $\\pm1, \\pm\\frac{1}{2}, \\pm\\frac{1}{3}, \\pm\\frac{1}{6}, \\pm2, \\pm\\frac{2}{3}, \\pm4, \\pm\\frac{4}{3}, \\pm5, \\pm\\frac{5}{2}, \\pm\\frac{5}{3}, \\pm\\frac{5}{6}, \\pm10, \\pm\\frac{10}{3}, \\pm20, \\pm\\frac{20}{3}$.\n\n## Step 4: Test possible rational roots\nWe start by testing these possible roots. Through synthetic division or direct substitution, we find that $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ is a root of the cubic polynomial.\n\n## Step 5: Factor the cubic polynomial completely\nSince $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ is a root, we can factor $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$ as $(2x-1)(3x^2+11x-20)$. Further factoring the quadratic $3x^2+11x-20$ gives us $(3x-4)(x+5)$.\n\n## Step 6: Combine all the factors\nCombining all the factors, including the $x$ we factored out initially, we get $x(2x-1)(3x-4)(x+5)$.\n\n## Step 7: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us the roots: $x = 0$ from $x = 0$, $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ from $2x - 1 = 0$, $x = \\frac{4}{3}$ from $3x - 4 = 0$, and $x = -5$ from $x + 5 = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{4}{3}, -5}$",
    "## Step 1: Factor out the greatest common factor\nFirst, we observe the polynomial $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$ and notice that we can factor out $x$ from every term, giving us $x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20)$.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the remaining polynomial\nNext, we attempt to factor the polynomial $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$. Looking for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of 20 divided by factors of 6. Testing simple factors like $x = 1$ or $x = -1$ can sometimes yield quick results.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Rational Root Theorem\nWe test $x = 1$ by substituting it into $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$, giving $6(1)^3+19(1)^2-51(1)+20 = 6+19-51+20 = -6$. Since $x = 1$ is not a root, we try $x = -1$: $6(-1)^3+19(-1)^2-51(-1)+20 = -6+19+51+20 = 84$. $x = -1$ is not a root either.\n\n## Step 4: Further simplification and factoring\nLet's try $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ (a factor of 20 divided by a factor of 6) in $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$: $6(\\frac{1}{2})^3+19(\\frac{1}{2})^2-51(\\frac{1}{2})+20 = \\frac{3}{4}+\\frac{19}{4}-\\frac{51}{2}+20 = \\frac{3}{4}+\\frac{19}{4}-\\frac{102}{4}+\\frac{80}{4} = 0$. So, $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ is a root.\n\n## Step 5: Perform polynomial division\nSince $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ is a root, we divide $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$ by $(2x-1)$ to find the other factor: $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20 = (2x-1)(3x^2+11x-20)$.\n\n## Step 6: Factor the quadratic equation\nNow, we factor the quadratic $3x^2+11x-20$. Looking for two numbers that multiply to $3 \\times -20 = -60$ and add up to $11$, we find $15$ and $-4$ because $15 \\times -4 = -60$ and $15 + (-4) = 11$. So, we can rewrite the quadratic as $3x^2+15x-4x-20$, which then factors into $3x(x+5)-4(x+5)$.\n\n## Step 7: Final factoring\nFactoring out $(x+5)$ from $3x(x+5)-4(x+5)$ gives $(3x-4)(x+5)$.\n\n## Step 8: Combine all factors\nCombining all the steps, the factored form of the original polynomial is $x(2x-1)(3x-4)(x+5)$.\n\n## Step 9: Find the roots\nThe roots are found when each factor equals zero: $x = 0$, $2x - 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{1}{2}$, $3x - 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{4}{3}$, and $x + 5 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{4}{3}, -5}$"

  "solution": "Since the polynomial has no constant term, we can immediately factor out an $x$ from every term\n$$x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20),$$and our first root $x=0$. Let $g(x) = 6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$. Then the remaining roots of our original polynomial are the roots of $g(x)$. By trying out simple values, we can see that $g(0) = 20 > 0$ and $g(1) = 6+19-51+20 = -6<0$. Thus, there must be a root of $g(x)$ between $0$ and $1$. From the Rational Root Theorem, we know that if $g(p/q) = 0$ then $p$ must divide $20$ and $q$ must divide $6$.\n\nChecking rational numbers of the form $p/q$, where $p$ divides $20$ and $q$ divides $6$, and $p/q$ is between $0$ and $1$, we find that\n$$\\begin{aligned} g\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) &= 6\\cdot\\frac{1}{8}+19\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}-51\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}+20 = 0.\n\\end{aligned}$$This means that $2x - 1$ is a factor of $g(x).$ Dividing by $2x-1$ gives us $g(x) = (2x-1)(3x^2+11x-20)$.\n\nThe quadratic $3x^2+11x-20$ factors as $(3x-4)(x+5),$ so our last two roots are $4/3$ and $-5$.\n\nThus, the roots of $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$ are $\\boxed{0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{4}{3}, -5}$.",
