    "## Step 1: Calculate $25^2+72^2$\nFirst, we need to calculate $25^2+72^2$. This means squaring 25 and 72 and then adding the results together. $25^2 = 625$ and $72^2 = 5184$. Adding these together gives $625 + 5184 = 5809$.\n\n## Step 2: Factorize 5809\nNext, we should attempt to factorize 5809 to find its prime divisors. We start by trying to divide 5809 by the smallest prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.) and move upwards until we find a factor.\n\n## Step 3: Find the prime factorization of 5809\nAfter attempting division with several small prime numbers, we find that 5809 is not easily divisible by them. Continuing the factorization process, we can either use trial division with larger primes or look for a more systematic approach to factorize 5809.\n\n## Step 4: Determine if 5809 is a prime number\nBefore proceeding further, let's check if 5809 itself is a prime number, as a prime number's only divisors are 1 and itself. If 5809 is prime, then it is its own largest prime divisor.\n\n## Step 5: Factorization of 5809\nUpon further examination or using a factorization method, we find that $5809 = 37 \\times 157$. Both 37 and 157 are prime numbers.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the largest prime divisor\nBetween 37 and 157, the largest prime divisor is 157.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{157}$",
    "## Step 1: Calculate the value of $25^2+72^2$\nTo find the largest prime divisor of $25^2+72^2$, we first need to calculate the value of $25^2+72^2$. This is equal to $625+5184$.\n\n## Step 2: Perform the addition to get the value of $25^2+72^2$\nPerforming the addition, we get $625+5184 = 5809$.\n\n## Step 3: Factorize 5809 to find its prime divisors\nNext, we need to factorize 5809 to find its prime divisors.
