    "## Step 1: Split the series into two groups\nWe can split the given series into two groups: $\\dfrac12 + \\dfrac{3}{2^3} + \\dfrac{5}{2^5} \\cdots$ and $\\dfrac{2}{3^2} + \\dfrac{4}{3^4} + \\dfrac{6}{3^6} \\cdots$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the sum of the first sequence\nLet $X = \\dfrac12 + \\dfrac{3}{2^3} + \\dfrac{5}{2^5} \\cdots$. Then $\\dfrac{X}{2^2} = \\dfrac{1}{2^3} + \\dfrac{3}{2^5} + \\dfrac{5}{2^7} \\cdots$. Subtracting these two equations, we get $X - \\dfrac{X}{2^2} = \\dfrac12 + \\dfrac{2}{2^3} + \\dfrac{2}{2^5} \\cdots$. Simplifying, we have $\\dfrac{3}{4}X = \\dfrac12 + \\dfrac{1}{2^2} + \\dfrac{1}{2^4} \\cdots$. This is a geometric series with first term $\\dfrac12$ and common ratio $\\dfrac14$. The sum of this geometric series is $\\dfrac{\\dfrac12}{1-\\dfrac14} = \\dfrac23$. Therefore, $\\dfrac{3}{4}X = \\dfrac23$, and $X = \\dfrac{8}{9}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the sum of the second sequence\nLet $Y = \\dfrac{2}{3^2} + \\dfrac{4}{3^4} + \\dfrac{6}{3^6} \\cdots$. Then $\\dfrac{Y}{3^2} = \\dfrac{2}{3^4} + \\dfrac{4}{3^6} + \\dfrac{6}{3^8} \\cdots$. Subtracting these two equations, we get $Y - \\dfrac{Y}{3^2} = \\dfrac{2}{3^2} + \\dfrac{2}{3^4} + \\dfrac{2}{3^6} \\cdots$. Simplifying, we have $\\dfrac{8}{9}Y = \\dfrac{2}{3^2} + \\dfrac{2}{3^4} + \\dfrac{2}{3^6} \\cdots$. This is a geometric series with first term $\\dfrac{2}{3^2}$ and common ratio $\\dfrac19$. The sum of this geometric series is $\\dfrac{\\dfrac{2}{3^2}}{1-\\dfrac19} = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{2}{9}}{\\dfrac{8}{9}} = \\dfrac14$. Therefore, $\\dfrac{8}{9}Y = \\dfrac14$, and $Y = \\dfrac{9}{32}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of the series\nThe sum of the series is $X + Y = \\dfrac{8}{9} + \\dfrac{9}{32} = \\dfrac{8 \\cdot 32}{9 \\cdot 32} + \\dfrac{9 \\cdot 9}{32 \\cdot 9} = \\dfrac{256}{288} + \\dfrac{81}{288} = \\dfrac{337}{288}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate a+b\nSince $\\dfrac{a}{b} = \\dfrac{337}{288}$, and $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, we have $a = 337$ and $b = 288$. Therefore, $a + b = 337 + 288 = 625$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{625}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the series\nThe given series is a sum of fractions where the numerators increase by 1 consecutively, and the denominators alternate between powers of 2 and 3 with increasing exponents.\n\n## Step 2: Split the series into two parts\nTo better understand and compute the series, we can split it into two separate series: one for the fractions with powers of 2 in the denominators and one for the fractions with powers of 3 in the denominators.\n\n## Step 3: Series with powers of 2 in the denominators\nThe series with powers of 2 in the denominators is $\\dfrac{1}{2^1} + \\dfrac{3}{2^3} + \\dfrac{5}{2^5} + \\cdots$. This can be represented as $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{2n-1}{2^{2n-1}}$.\n\n## Step 4: Series with powers of 3 in the denominators\nThe series with powers of 3 in the denominators is $\\dfrac{2}{3^2} + \\dfrac{4}{3^4} + \\dfrac{6}{3^6} + \\cdots$. This can be represented as $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{2n}{3^{2n}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Compute the sum of the series with powers of 2\nLet $X = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{2n-1}{2^{2n-1}}$. Multiplying $X$ by 4 and subtracting $X$ from it will help us find a simpler series to compute.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the value of $X$\nAfter performing the operations mentioned in Step 5, we get $3X = \\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{2}{2^3} + \\dfrac{2}{2^5} + \\cdots$. Simplifying further, $3X = \\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{1}{2^2} + \\dfrac{1}{2^4} + \\dfrac{1}{2^6} + \\cdots$. Recognizing this as a geometric series, we can find its sum.\n\n## Step 7: Sum of the geometric series for $X$\nThe geometric series for $X$ simplifies to $3X = \\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{1}{2^2} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{1 - \\dfrac{1}{2^2}}$. After calculating, $3X = \\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{\\dfrac{1}{4}}{1 - \\dfrac{1}{4}} = \\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{1}{4} \\cdot \\dfrac{4}{3} = \\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{1}{3} = \\dfrac{3}{6} + \\dfrac{2}{6} = \\dfrac{5}{6}$. Therefore, $X = \\dfrac{5}{18}$.\n\n## Step 8: Compute the sum of the series with powers of 3\nLet $Y = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{2n}{3^{2n}}$. This can be calculated by recognizing it as a derivative of a geometric series.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the value of $Y$\n$Y$ can be found by differentiating the geometric series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x^n = \\dfrac{1}{1-x}$ with respect to $x$ and then multiplying by $x$ to get $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} nx^n = \\dfrac{x}{(1-x)^2}$. Substituting $x = \\dfrac{1}{9}$ (since $3^{2n} = (3^2)^n = 9^n$), we get $Y = \\dfrac{2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{9}}{(1 - \\dfrac{1}{9})^2} = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{2}{9}}{(\\dfrac{8}{9})^2} = \\dfrac{2}{9} \\cdot \\dfrac{81}{64} = \\dfrac{9}{32}$.\n\n## Step 10: Sum of the entire series\nThe sum of the entire series is $X + Y = \\dfrac{5}{18} + \\dfrac{9}{32}$.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the sum\nTo add these fractions, find a common denominator: $\\dfrac{5}{18} \\cdot \\dfrac{16}{16} + \\dfrac{9}{32} \\cdot \\dfrac{9}{9} = \\dfrac{80}{288} + \\dfrac{81}{288} = \\dfrac{161}{288}$.\n\n## Step 12: Compute $a+b$\nSince $\\dfrac{a}{b} = \\dfrac{161}{288}$ and $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, $a = 161$ and $b = 288$. Therefore, $a + b = 161 + 288$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{449}$",
    "## Step 1: Break down the given series\nThe given series is $\\dfrac ab=\\dfrac1{2^1}+\\dfrac2{3^2}+\\dfrac3{2^3}+\\dfrac4{3^4}+\\dfrac5{2^5}+\\dfrac6{3^6}+\\cdots$. We can split this into two groups: $\\dfrac12 + \\dfrac{3}{2^3} + \\dfrac{5}{2^5} \\cdots$ and $\\dfrac{2}{3^2} + \\dfrac{4}{3^4} + \\dfrac{6}{3^6} \\cdots$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the sum of the first sequence\nLet's denote the sum of the first sequence as $X = \\dfrac12 + \\dfrac{3}{2^3} + \\dfrac{5}{2^5} \\cdots$. To find the sum of this sequence, we can use the formula for an infinite geometric series. Multiplying $X$ by $\\dfrac{1}{4}$ gives $\\dfrac{1}{4}X = \\dfrac{1}{2^3} + \\dfrac{3}{2^5} + \\dfrac{5}{2^7} \\cdots$. Subtracting $\\dfrac{1}{4}X$ from $X$ gives $\\dfrac{3}{4}X = \\dfrac12 + \\dfrac{2}{2^3} + \\dfrac{2}{2^5} \\cdots$. This can be further simplified into $\\dfrac{3}{4}X = \\dfrac12 + \\dfrac{1}{2^2} + \\dfrac{1}{2^4} \\cdots$. The sum of the series $\\dfrac{1}{2^2} + \\dfrac{1}{2^4} \\cdots$ is a geometric series with first term $\\dfrac{1}{4}$ and common ratio $\\dfrac{1}{4}$, which sums to $\\dfrac{\\dfrac{1}{4}}{1 - \\dfrac{1}{4}} = \\dfrac{1}{3}$. So, $\\dfrac{3}{4}X = \\dfrac12 + \\dfrac{1}{3}$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for X\n$\\dfrac{3}{4}X = \\dfrac12 + \\dfrac{1}{3} = \\dfrac{3}{6} + \\dfrac{2}{6} = \\dfrac{5}{6}$. Therefore, $X = \\dfrac{4}{3} \\times \\dfrac{5}{6} = \\dfrac{10}{9}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of the second sequence\nLet's denote the sum of the second sequence as $Y = \\dfrac{2}{3^2} + \\dfrac{4}{3^4} + \\dfrac{6}{3^6} \\cdots$. To find the sum of this sequence, we can use a similar approach as before. Multiplying $Y$ by $\\dfrac{1}{9}$ gives $\\dfrac{1}{9}Y = \\dfrac{2}{3^4} + \\dfrac{4}{3^6} + \\dfrac{6}{3^8} \\cdots$. Subtracting $\\dfrac{1}{9}Y$ from $Y$ gives $\\dfrac{8}{9}Y = \\dfrac{2}{3^2} + \\dfrac{2}{3^4} + \\dfrac{2}{3^6} \\cdots$. This can be further simplified into $\\dfrac{8}{9}Y = \\dfrac{2}{3^2} + \\dfrac{2}{3^4} + \\dfrac{2}{3^6} \\cdots$. The sum of the series $\\dfrac{2}{3^4} + \\dfrac{2}{3^6} \\cdots$ is a geometric series with first term $\\dfrac{2}{81}$ and common ratio $\\dfrac{1}{9}$, which sums to $\\dfrac{\\dfrac{2}{81}}{1 - \\dfrac{1}{9}} = \\dfrac{1}{36}$. So, $\\dfrac{8}{9}Y = \\dfrac{2}{9} + \\dfrac{1}{36}$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for Y\n$\\dfrac{8}{9}Y = \\dfrac{2}{9} + \\dfrac{1}{36} = \\dfrac{8}{36} + \\dfrac{1}{36} = \\dfrac{9}{36} = \\dfrac{1}{4}$. Therefore, $Y = \\dfrac{9}{8} \\times \\dfrac{1}{4} = \\dfrac{9}{32}$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the sum of X and Y\nNow, we can find the sum of $X$ and $Y$. $X + Y = \\dfrac{10}{9} + \\dfrac{9}{32}$. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is $288$. $\\dfrac{10}{9} = \\dfrac{10 \\times 32}{9 \\times 32} = \\dfrac{320}{288}$ and $\\dfrac{9}{32} = \\dfrac{9 \\times 9}{32 \\times 9} = \\dfrac{81}{288}$. So, $X + Y = \\dfrac{320}{288} + \\dfrac{81}{288} = \\dfrac{401}{288}$.\n\n## Step 7: Compute a+b\nGiven $\\dfrac{a}{b} = \\dfrac{401}{288}$, and $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, $a = 401$ and $b = 288$. Therefore, $a + b = 401 + 288 = 689$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{689}$"
