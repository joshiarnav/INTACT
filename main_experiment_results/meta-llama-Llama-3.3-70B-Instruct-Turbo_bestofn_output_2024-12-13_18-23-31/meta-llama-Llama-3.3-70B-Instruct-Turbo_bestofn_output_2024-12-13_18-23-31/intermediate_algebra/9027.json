    "## Step 1: Recognize the system of equations as related to the coefficients of a polynomial when factored and expanded.\nThe system of equations is reminiscent of the expansion of a polynomial of the form $(x^2 + ax + c)(x^2 + bx + d)$, where the coefficients $a, b, c, d$ are the same as those in the given system of equations.\n\n## Step 2: Formulate the polynomial using the given system of equations.\nConsider the polynomial $p(x) = (x^2 + ax + c)(x^2 + bx + d)$. When expanded, it should match the pattern suggested by the system of equations.\n\n## Step 3: Expand the polynomial $p(x)$ to relate it to the system of equations.\nThe expansion of $p(x)$ is $x^4 + (a+b)x^3 + (ab+c+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + cd$.\n\n## Step 4: Match the expanded polynomial with the system of equations to find a quartic equation.\nBy matching coefficients, we get the quartic equation $x^4 + 15x^3 + 78x^2 + 160x + 96 = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the quartic equation to find its roots.\nThe quartic equation can be factored into $(x+4)(x+4)(x+1)(x+6) = 0$, yielding roots $-4, -4, -1, -6$.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the factors of the quartic equation to determine possible values for $a, b, c, d$.\nThe factors suggest two possible groupings for the quadratic factors: $(x^2 + 8x + 16)(x^2 + 7x + 6)$ and $(x^2 + 5x + 4)(x^2 + 10x + 24)$, among others, considering the multiplicity of the root $-4$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ for each possible grouping.\nFor the first grouping, $(x^2 + 8x + 16)(x^2 + 7x + 6)$, we have $a=8$, $b=7$, $c=16$, $d=6$, so $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 8^2 + 7^2 + 16^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 49 + 256 + 36 = 405$.\nFor the second grouping, $(x^2 + 5x + 4)(x^2 + 10x + 24)$, we have $a=5$, $b=10$, $c=4$, $d=24$, so $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 5^2 + 10^2 + 4^2 + 24^2 = 25 + 100 + 16 + 576 = 717$.\n\n## Step 8: Identify the grouping that yields the greatest value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$.\nComparing the calculated values, $717$ is greater than $405$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{717}$",

Consider a quadratic equation of the form $(x^2 + ax + c)(x^2 + bx + d)$.\n\n## Step 2: Expand the quadratic equation to match the system of equations.\nExpanding the quadratic equation gives us: $x^4 + (a+b)x^3 + (ab+c+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + cd$.\n\n## Step 3: Match the coefficients of the expanded quadratic equation with the given system of equations.\nMatching coefficients, we have: $a+b = 15$, $ab+c+d = 78$, $ad+bc = 160$, and $cd = 96$.\n\n## Step 4: Recognize that the given system represents the coefficients of a quartic polynomial when factored into two quadratic equations.\nThe system represents the coefficients of a quartic polynomial that can be factored into two quadratic equations.\n\n## Step 5: Construct the quartic polynomial using the given coefficients.\nThe quartic polynomial is $x^4 + 15x^3 + 78x^2 + 160x + 96$.\n\n## Step 6: Factor the quartic polynomial into two quadratic equations.\nWe need to factor $x^4 + 15x^3 + 78x^2 + 160x + 96$ into $(x^2 + ax + c)(x^2 + bx + d)$.\n\n## Step 7: Use the Rational Root Theorem to find potential rational roots of the quartic polynomial.\nPotential rational roots are factors of 96, which are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm3, \\pm4, \\pm6, \\pm8, \\pm12, \\pm16, \\pm24, \\pm32, \\pm48, \\pm96$.\n\n## Step 8: Test potential rational roots to find a root.\nThrough trial and error or using synthetic division, we find that $x = -4$ and $x = -2$ could be roots of the quartic polynomial (though the exact process of finding these roots is not detailed here due to the complexity of manual calculations).\n\n## Step 9: Factor the quartic polynomial using the found roots.\nIf $x = -4$ and $x = -2$ are roots, then $(x + 4)$ and $(x + 2)$ are factors. Dividing the quartic polynomial by these factors, we can find the other factor as $(x^2 + 9x + 12)$.\n\n## Step 10: Completely factor the quartic polynomial.\nCompletely factoring gives us $(x+4)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)$ or more correctly for our purposes $(x^2 + 6x + 8)(x^2 + 9x + 12)$, which can be matched to our original quadratic forms.\n\n## Step 11: Match the factors to the quadratic forms to find values of $a, b, c, d$.\nFrom the factor $(x^2 + 6x + 8)$, we get $a = 6$, $c = 8$. From $(x^2 + 9x + 12)$, we get $b = 9$, $d = 12$.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$.\nUsing $a = 6$, $b = 9$, $c = 8$, $d = 12$, we find $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 6^2 + 9^2 + 8^2 + 12^2$.\n\n## Step 13: Perform the calculation of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$.\nCalculating $6^2 + 9^2 + 8^2 + 12^2 = 36 + 81 + 64 + 144$.\n\n## Step 14: Complete the calculation to find the numerical value.\n$36 + 81 + 64 + 144 = 325$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{725}$"
