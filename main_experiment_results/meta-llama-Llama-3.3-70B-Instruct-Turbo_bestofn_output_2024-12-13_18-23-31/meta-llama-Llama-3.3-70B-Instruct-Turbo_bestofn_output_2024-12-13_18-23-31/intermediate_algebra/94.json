    "## Step 1: Understand the given conditions\nWe are given that $|a| = |b| = |c| = r > 0$, and the equation $az^2 + bz + c = 0$ holds for complex numbers $a, b, c, z$. We need to find the largest possible value of $|z|$.\n\n## Step 2: Re-arrange the equation\nThe equation can be re-arranged as $az^2 = -bz - c$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Triangle Inequality\nBy the Triangle Inequality, $|az^2| = |-bz - c| \\le |bz| + |c|$.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute the given conditions\nSince $|a| = |b| = |c| = r$, we have $r|z|^2 \\le r|z| + r$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the inequality\nDividing both sides by $r$ gives $|z|^2 \\le |z| + 1$.\n\n## Step 6: Rearrange the inequality\nThis can be rewritten as $|z|^2 - |z| - 1 \\le 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve the quadratic inequality\nSolving the quadratic inequality $|z|^2 - |z| - 1 \\le 0$ gives us the roots of the corresponding equation $|z|^2 - |z| - 1 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, $|z| = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the range of $|z|$\nSince $|z|$ must be positive, the largest possible value of $|z|$ is when $|z| = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}}$",
    "## Step 1:  Given the equation $az^2 + bz + c = 0$, we need to find the largest possible value of $|z|$.\nWe start with the given equation $az^2 + bz + c = 0$ and rearrange it to $az^2 = -bz - c$.\n\n## Step 2:  Apply the Triangle Inequality to $az^2 = -bz - c$.\nBy the Triangle Inequality, $|az^2| = |-bz - c| \\le |bz| + |c|$.\n\n## Step 3:  Substitute $|a| = |b| = |c| = r$ into the inequality.\nSince $|a| = |b| = |c| = r$, we have $|az^2| = r|z|^2$ and $|bz| + |c| = r|z| + r$.\n\n## Step 4:  Use the inequality $r|z|^2 \\le r|z| + r$ to find the largest possible value of $|z|$.\nThus, $r|z|^2 \\le r|z| + r$. Dividing both sides by $r$ gives $|z|^2 \\le |z| + 1$.\n\n## Step 5:  Rearrange the inequality $|z|^2 \\le |z| + 1$ into a quadratic inequality.\nThis can be rewritten as $|z|^2 - |z| - 1 \\le 0$.\n\n## Step 6:  Solve the quadratic inequality $|z|^2 - |z| - 1 \\le 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula, the roots of $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$ are $x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$.

    "## Step 1: Re-arrange the given equation\nWe start with the given equation $az^2 + bz + c = 0$. This equation can be re-arranged as $az^2 = -bz - c$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Triangle Inequality\nThe Triangle Inequality states that for any complex numbers $x$ and $y$, $|x + y| \\leq |x| + |y|$. Applying this to the re-arranged equation, we get $|az^2| = |-bz - c| \\leq |bz| + |c|$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the given information about the absolute values of $a$, $b$, and $c$\nSince $|a| = |b| = |c| = r > 0$, we can substitute these into the inequality from Step 2 to get $|a||z|^2 \\leq |b||z| + |c|$, which simplifies to $r|z|^2 \\leq r|z| + r$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the inequality\nDivide the entire inequality by $r$ (since $r > 0$) to get $|z|^2 \\leq |z| + 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the inequality for $|z|$\nRearrange the inequality into a quadratic form: $|z|^2 - |z| - 1 \\leq 0$. This is a quadratic inequality in terms of $|z|$. Let $x = |z|$, so we have $x^2 - x - 1 \\leq 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the quadratic inequality\nTo solve $x^2 - x - 1 \\leq 0$, we can factor the quadratic equation $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$ to find its roots. The roots can be found using the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. For our equation, $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = -1$. Substituting these values into the formula gives $x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Thus, the roots are $x = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $x = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Since the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive, the solution to the inequality $x^2 - x - 1 \\leq 0$ is $\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\leq x \\leq \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 7: Interpret the solution in the context of $|z|$\nSince $x = |z|$, the largest possible value of $|z|$ is when $x = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}}$"
