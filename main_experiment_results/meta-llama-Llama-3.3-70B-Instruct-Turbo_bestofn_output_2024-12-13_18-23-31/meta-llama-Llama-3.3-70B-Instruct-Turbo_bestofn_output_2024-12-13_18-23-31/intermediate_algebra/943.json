    "## Step 1: Recall the factorization of the sum of cubes\nWe know that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc)$. Given $a + b + c = 0$, this simplifies to $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the factorization of the sum of fifth powers\nGiven $a + b + c = 0$, we also have a relation for the fifth powers, but it's more complex. However, we can utilize the fact that $a^5 + b^5 + c^5 = 5abc(a^2 + ab + b^2)$ when $a + b + c = 0$, but we actually need to relate it directly to our given equations. The key relation we have is $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = a^5 + b^5 + c^5$, and from step 1, we know $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$.\n\n## Step 3: Establish the relationship between $a^3 + b^3 + c^3$ and $a^5 + b^5 + c^5$\nSince $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = a^5 + b^5 + c^5$, and knowing $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$, we have $3abc = a^5 + b^5 + c^5$. However, we need to find a direct way to relate $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ to the given equations.\n\n## Step 4: Relate $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ to $abc$ and the given equations\nGiven $a + b + c = 0$, we can square both sides to get $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 0$. This implies $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = -2(ab + ac + bc)$. We also know from the expansion of $(a + b + c)^3 = 0$ that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3ab(a + b) + 3ac(a + c) + 3bc(b + c) + 6abc = 0$. Simplifying this with $a + b + c = 0$, we get $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = 0$, which we already used to find $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$.\n\n## Step 5: Connect $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ to $a^3 + b^3 + c^3$ and $a^5 + b^5 + c^5$\nWe need a direct link between $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ and the higher power equations. Knowing $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$ and aiming to find $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$, let's consider the equation $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = a^5 + b^5 + c^5$ in terms of $abc$ and symmetric polynomials.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ using known relations\nSince $a + b + c = 0$, we have $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = -2(ab + ac + bc)$ as found earlier. However, to directly solve for $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$, we must utilize the given $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = a^5 + b^5 + c^5$ in a manner that connects to $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$. Given that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$ and this equals $a^5 + b^5 + c^5$, we need an expression that links $abc$ or $a^3 + b^3 + c^3$ directly to $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$.\n\n## Step 7: Utilize Newton's Sums or similar methods to find $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$\nNewton's Sums relate the coefficients of a polynomial to its roots, which can be applied here. For a cubic equation with roots $a, b, c$ and $a + b + c = 0$, we have $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + ac + bc)$. Since $a + b + c = 0$, this simplifies. However, to directly apply Newton's Sums or a similar principle, consider that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$ implies a relationship between the symmetric polynomials that can be used to find $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve using the fact that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$ and given conditions\nSince $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = a^5 + b^5 + c^5$ and knowing $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$, for $a^5 + b^5 + c^5$ to equal $3abc$, and considering the constraints, let's find a direct path to $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$. Recall that when $a + b + c = 0$, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = -2(ab + ac + bc)$. We need to link this to $3abc = a^5 + b^5 + c^5$.\n\n## Step 9: Apply the condition $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = a^5 + b^5 + c^5$ to solve for $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$\nGiven $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$ and this equals $a^5 + b^5 + c^5$, and knowing $a + b + c = 0$, let's use the fact that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$ to imply $abc$ is a key.

Given $a + b + c = 0$, we have $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$.\n\n## Step 2: Express $a^5 + b^5 + c^5$ in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$\nWe know that $a^5 + b^5 + c^5 = (a^3 + b^3 + c^3)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc) - 3abc(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc) + 5abc(a + b + c)$, but since $a + b + c = 0$, the last term vanishes, simplifying the expression.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression for $a^5 + b^5 + c^5$ using $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$\nGiven $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$ and $a + b + c = 0$, we can simplify $a^5 + b^5 + c^5$ as $a^5 + b^5 + c^5 = 3abc(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc) - 3abc(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc) = 0$ if we were to incorrectly simplify. However, the correct approach involves utilizing the given equation $a^3+b^3+c^3=a^5+b^5+c^5$ directly in relation to the condition $a+b+c=0$ and exploring the properties of symmetric polynomials.\n\n## Step 4: Correct approach using symmetric polynomials and given conditions\nSince $a+b+c=0$, we can express $c = -a - b$. Substituting $c$ in terms of $a$ and $b$ into the equation $a^3+b^3+c^3=a^5+b^5+c^5$ would lead to complex expressions. Instead, recall that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$ when $a + b + c = 0$. The condition $a^3+b^3+c^3=a^5+b^5+c^5$ implies $3abc = a^5+b^5+c^5$.

Also, recall that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc)$, which simplifies to $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$ since $a + b + c = 0$. To find $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$, we should look for a relationship that connects $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ with $a^3 + b^3 + c^3$ or $a^5 + b^5 + c^5$ under the given constraints.\n\n## Step 6: Direct calculation using the given constraints\nGiven $a + b + c = 0$, we know $c = -a - b$. Substituting into $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$ gives $a^3 + b^3 - (a + b)^3 = 3ab(-a - b)$, simplifying to $-3ab(a + b) = 3ab(-a - b)$, which is consistent but doesn't directly help. We need a relation involving $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$. Considering $a^5 + b^5 + c^5 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3$ and knowing $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$, we explore how $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ relates to $abc$ or other known quantities.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify using $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$ and the condition $a+b+c=0$\nSince $a+b+c=0$, then $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = -2(ab + ac + bc)$.

  "solution": "From the factorization\n\\[a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc),\\]we know that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc.$\n\nSince $a + b + c = 0,$ $c = -a - b,$ so\n\\begin{align*}\na^5 + b^5 + c^5 &= a^5 + b^5 - (a + b)^5 \\\\\n&= -5a^4 b - 10a^3 b^2 - 10a^2 b^3 - 5ab^4 \\\\\n&= -5ab(a^3 + 2a^2 b + 2ab^2 + b^3) \\\\\n&= -5ab[(a^3 + b^3) + (2a^2 b + 2ab^2)] \\\\\n&= -5ab[(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) + 2ab(a + b)] \\\\\n&= -5ab(a + b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) \\\\\n&= 5abc(a^2 + ab + b^2),\n\\end{align*}so\n\\[3abc = 5abc(a^2 + ab + b^2).\\]Since $a,$ $b,$ $c$ are all nonzero, we can write\n\\[a^2 + ab + b^2 = \\frac{3}{5}.\\]Hence,\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 &= a^2 + b^2 + (a + b)^2 \\\\\n&= a^2 + b^2 + a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\\\\n&= 2a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2 \\\\\n&= 2(a^2 + ab + b^2) = \\boxed{\\frac{6}{5}}.\n\\end{align*}",
