    "To determine if the number $854n526$ is divisible by $11$, we use the divisibility rule for $11$, which states that the alternating sum of the digits must be divisible by $11$. \n\nSo, let's calculate this alternating sum:\n$8 - 5 + 4 - n + 5 - 2 + 6$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$8 - 5 + 4 - n + 5 - 2 + 6 = 16 - n$\n\nFor the number to be divisible by $11$, $16 - n$ must be divisible by $11$. \n\nThe only value of $n$ that satisfies this condition is when $16 - n = 11$, because $16 - n$ must be a positive number less than $16$ (since $n$ is a single digit), and it must be divisible by $11$. \n\nTherefore, solving $16 - n = 11$ gives:\n$n = 16 - 11$\n$n = 5$\n\nThus, the value of $n$ that makes the number $854n526$ divisible by $11$ is $5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

    "To determine if the seven-digit number $854n526$ is divisible by $11$, we can use the divisibility rule for $11$, which states that the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions (units, hundreds, ten-thousands, etc.) and the sum of the digits in the even positions (tens, thousands, hundred-thousands, etc.) must be divisible by $11$.\n\nFirst, let's identify the positions of the digits:\n- $8$ is in the hundred-thousands place (odd position),\n- $5$ is in the ten-thousands place (even position),\n- $4$ is in the thousands place (odd position),\n- $n$ is in the hundreds place (even position),\n- $5$ is in the tens place (odd position),\n- $2$ is in the units place (even position),\n- $6$ is in the millions place (odd position, if we consider the number in the format $xyzxyzx$ for odd/even positioning).\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions:\n- Sum of digits in odd positions: $8 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 23$\n- Sum of digits in even positions: $5 + n + 2 = 7 + n$\n\nThe difference between these sums must be divisible by $11$ for the entire number to be divisible by $11$:\n\\[23 - (7 + n) = 16 - n\\]\n\nFor $16 - n$ to be divisible by $11$, $n$ must be such that the result is either $0$ or a multiple of $11$. The possible values for $n$ that satisfy this condition are:\n- $n = 5$, because $16 - 5 = 11$, which is divisible by $11$.\n\nThus, the value of $n$ that makes $854n526$ divisible by $11$ is $\\boxed{5}$."

  "solution": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$.",
