    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the given number in base 10\nWe need to convert the decimal number $199_{10}$ to its binary representation in base 2.\n\n## Step 2: Convert $199_{10}$ to base 2\nTo convert $199_{10}$ to base 2, we start by finding the largest power of 2 that fits into 199, which is $2^7 = 128$. The remainder after subtracting 128 from 199 is 71.\n\n## Step 3: Continue breaking down the remainder\nNext, we find the largest power of 2 that fits into 71, which is $2^6 = 64$. The remainder after subtracting 64 from 71 is 7.\n\n## Step 4: Further break down the remainder\nThen, we find the largest power of 2 that fits into 7, which is $2^2 = 4$. The remainder after subtracting 4 from 7 is 3.\n\n## Step 5: Break down the remainder again\nWe continue by finding the largest power of 2 that fits into 3, which is $2^1 = 2$. The remainder after subtracting 2 from 3 is 1.\n\n## Step 6: Final step in breaking down the remainder\nLastly, we have 1, which is $2^0 = 1$.\n\n## Step 7: Represent $199_{10}$ in base 2\nFrom the steps above, we can represent $199_{10}$ in base 2 as $11000111_2$ because we used $2^7, 2^6, 2^2, 2^1$, and $2^0$.\n\n## Step 8: Count the number of zeros and ones\nIn the binary representation $11000111_2$, the number of zeros ($x$) is 3 and the number of ones ($y$) is 5.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate $y-x$\nTo find $y-x$, we subtract the number of zeros from the number of ones: $y - x = 5 - 3 = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"

  "solution": "The largest power of 2 that divides $199$ is $2^7$, which equals 128. Since $(1\\cdot 2^7)=128<199<(2\\cdot 2^7)=256$, the digit in the $2^7$ place is $1$. We know that $199-128=71$, and that $71$ can be expressed as $64+4+2+1$, or $(1\\cdot 2^6)+(1\\cdot 2^2)+(1\\cdot 2^1)+(1\\cdot 2^0)$. This means that $199_{10}=11000111_2$. Therefore, $x=3$ and $y=5$; and $y-x=5-3=\\boxed{2}$.",
