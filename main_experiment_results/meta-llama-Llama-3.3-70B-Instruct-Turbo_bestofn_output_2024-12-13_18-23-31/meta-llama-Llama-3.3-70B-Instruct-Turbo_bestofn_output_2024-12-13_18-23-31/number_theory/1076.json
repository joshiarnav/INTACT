    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the digit in the tens place when $7^{2005}$ is expressed in decimal notation.\n\n## Step 2: Look for patterns in powers of 7\nTo find a pattern, let's calculate the first few powers of 7 and look at their last two digits:\n- $7^1 = 7$\n- $7^2 = 49$\n- $7^3 = 343$\n- $7^4 = 2401$\n- $7^5 = 16807$\n- $7^6 = 117649$\n- $7^7 = 823543$\n- $7^8 = 5764801$\n- ...\n\n## Step 3: Identify the pattern\nLooking at the last two digits of the powers of 7, we notice a repeating pattern every 4 powers:\n- $7^1$ ends in 07\n- $7^2$ ends in 49\n- $7^3$ ends in 43\n- $7^4$ ends in 01\n- $7^5$ ends in 07\n- $7^6$ ends in 49\n- $7^7$ ends in 43\n- $7^8$ ends in 01\n- ...\n\n## Step 4: Apply the pattern to $7^{2005}$\nSince the pattern repeats every 4 powers, we can find the remainder when 2005 is divided by 4 to determine which part of the pattern $7^{2005}$ falls into.\n2005 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 1.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the tens digit\nGiven that 2005 has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, $7^{2005}$ will have the same last two digits as $7^1$, which is 07. Therefore, the digit in the tens place is 0.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

  "solution": "Let's find the cycle of the last two digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $07, 49, 43, 01, 07, 49, 43, 01,\\ldots$ . The cycle of the last two digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 numbers long: 07, 49, 43, 01. Thus, to find the tens digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=0$ or 1 corresponds to the tens digit 0, and $R=2$ or 3 corresponds to the units digit 4). Since $2005\\div4=501R1$, the tens digit of $7^{2005}$ is $ \\boxed{0}$.",
