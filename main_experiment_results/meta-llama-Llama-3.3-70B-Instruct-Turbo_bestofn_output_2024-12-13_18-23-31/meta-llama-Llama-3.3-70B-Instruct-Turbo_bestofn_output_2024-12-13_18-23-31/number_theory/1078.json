    "To solve this problem, let's consider the properties of division and remainders.\n\n1. **Understanding the initial condition**: When an integer (let's call it $n$) is divided by 15, the remainder is 7. This can be represented as $n = 15q + 7$, where $q$ is the quotient of the division.\n\n2. **Division by 3**: Now, we need to find the remainder when $n$ is divided by 3. Since $n = 15q + 7$, let's analyze how this expression behaves when divided by 3. The term $15q$ is always divisible by 3 because 15 is divisible by 3. Therefore, the remainder when dividing $n$ by 3 depends solely on the remainder of 7 divided by 3. When 7 is divided by 3, the remainder is 1.\n\n3. **Division by 5**: Next, we find the remainder when $n$ is divided by 5. Again, considering $n = 15q + 7$, the term $15q$ is always divisible by 5 because 15 is divisible by 5. Thus, the remainder when dividing $n$ by 5 depends solely on the remainder of 7 divided by 5. When 7 is divided by 5, the remainder is 2.\n\n4. **Sum of the remainders**: To find the sum of the remainders when $n$ is divided by 3 and by 5, we simply add the remainders found in steps 2 and 3. So, the sum of the remainders is $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",
    "To find the sum of the remainders when the integer is divided by 3 and by 5, given that the remainder is 7 when divided by 15, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding the given condition**: The integer, when divided by 15, leaves a remainder of 7.
