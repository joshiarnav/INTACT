    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the key pieces of information.\nWe are given that the total number of people in the incoming freshman class is less than 500. When the freshmen line up in columns of 23, there are 22 people in the last column, indicating that the total number of people leaves a remainder of 22 when divided by 23. Similarly, when they line up in columns of 21, there are 14 people in the last column, meaning the total number of people leaves a remainder of 14 when divided by 21.\n\n## Step 2: Establish the system of linear congruences based on the given information.\nLet's denote the total number of people as N. From the first piece of information, we have N \u2261 22 (mod 23), and from the second piece, we have N \u2261 14 (mod 21).\n\n## Step 3: Solve the first congruence for a general form of N.\nFor N \u2261 22 (mod 23), we can express N as N = 23k + 22, where k is an integer.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute the general form of N into the second congruence to find a specific solution.\nSubstituting N = 23k + 22 into N \u2261 14 (mod 21), we get 23k + 22 \u2261 14 (mod 21). Simplifying, 23k \u2261 -8 (mod 21). Since 23 \u2261 2 (mod 21), we can further simplify to 2k \u2261 -8 (mod 21).\n\n## Step 5: Solve for k in the simplified congruence.\nTo solve 2k \u2261 -8 (mod 21), first simplify -8 to its positive equivalent modulo 21, which is 13 (since -8 + 21 = 13). So, we have 2k \u2261 13 (mod 21). To find the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 21, we look for a number x such that 2x \u2261 1 (mod 21). Since 2*11 = 22 \u2261 1 (mod 21), the inverse of 2 is 11. Thus, multiplying both sides of the congruence by 11, we get k \u2261 11*13 (mod 21), which simplifies to k \u2261 143 (mod 21). Reducing 143 modulo 21 gives k \u2261 11 (mod 21).\n\n## Step 6: Express k in terms of another integer to substitute back into the equation for N.\nWe can express k as k = 21m + 11, where m is an integer.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute the expression for k back into the equation for N to find a specific solution.\nSubstituting k = 21m + 11 into N = 23k + 22, we get N = 23(21m + 11) + 22. Simplifying, N = 483m + 253 + 22, which further simplifies to N = 483m + 275.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the constraint that N must be less than 500 to find the solution.\nGiven N < 500, we look at N = 483m + 275. For m = 0, N = 275, which satisfies the constraint. For m = 1, N = 483*1 + 275 = 758, which does not satisfy the constraint. Therefore, the only valid solution under the constraint N < 500 is when m = 0.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{275}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify what is given\nWe are given that the total number of people in the incoming freshman class is less than 500. When the students line up in columns of 23, there are 22 people left in the last column. Similarly, when they line up in columns of 21, there are 14 people left in the last column.\n\n## Step 2: Translate given information into mathematical expressions\nLet's denote the total number of people in the class as N. From the first condition, we can say N = 23a + 22, where 'a' is an integer representing the number of full columns when the students line up in columns of 23. From the second condition, we can say N = 21b + 14, where 'b' is an integer representing the number of full columns when the students line up in columns of 21.\n\n## Step 3: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) or trial and error method to find N\nSince 23 and 21 are relatively prime (their greatest common divisor is 1), the Chinese Remainder Theorem can be applied. However, given the small range of possible values (less than 500), we can also use a trial and error method to find a value of N that satisfies both conditions.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the trial and error method\nWe start with the first condition, N = 23a + 22, and check values of 'a' to see if any resulting N also satisfies the second condition, N = 21b + 14, for any integer 'b'.\n\n## Step 5: Test values for 'a' in the first equation\nStart with a = 1, then N = 23*1 + 22 = 45. Checking if this satisfies the second condition: 45 = 21b + 14. Solving for 'b', we get 45 - 14 = 21b, which simplifies to 31 = 21b. This does not yield an integer 'b', so a = 1 is not a solution.\n\n## Step 6: Continue testing values for 'a'\nWe continue this process, increasing 'a' by 1 and checking each resulting N to see if it satisfies the second condition.\n\n## Step 7: Find a suitable value for 'a' that satisfies both conditions\nAfter several trials, we find a value for 'a' that gives us an N that also satisfies the second condition. Given the specific nature of the problem, we are looking for a value of N such that N = 23a + 22 and N = 21b + 14. Let's calculate directly: we need to find the first few values of N that satisfy both equations and are less than 500.\n\n## Step 8: Listing potential values for N based on the first condition\nFor a = 1, N = 45; for a = 2, N = 68; for a = 3, N = 91; for a = 4, N = 114; for a = 5, N = 137; for a = 6, N = 160; for a = 7, N = 183; for a = 8, N = 206; for a = 9, N = 229; for a = 10, N = 252; for a = 11, N = 275; for a = 12, N = 298; for a = 13, N = 321; for a = 14, N = 344; for a = 15, N = 367; for a = 16, N = 390; for a = 17, N = 413; for a = 18, N = 436; for a = 19, N = 459; for a = 20, N = 482.\n\n## Step 9: Checking these values against the second condition\nWe now check these potential values of N against the second condition, N = 21b + 14, to find a match.\n\n## Step 10: Identify a value of N that satisfies both conditions\nUpon checking, we find that N = 413 satisfies both conditions: 413 = 23*18 + 22 (from the first condition) and 413 = 21*19 + 14 (from the second condition).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{413}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem describes a situation where the number of people in the incoming freshman class must satisfy two conditions based on different column arrangements. First, when divided into columns of 23, there are 22 people left in the last column. This can be represented as $N = 23a + 22$, where $N$ is the total number of people and $a$ is an integer representing the number of full columns. Second, when divided into columns of 21, there are 14 people left in the last column, which can be represented as $N = 21b + 14$, where $b$ is an integer representing the number of full columns in this arrangement.\n\n## Step 2: Set up equations based on the given conditions\nFrom the first condition, we have $N = 23a + 22$. From the second condition, we have $N = 21b + 14$. Since both expressions equal $N$, we can set them equal to each other to find a relationship between $a$ and $b$: $23a + 22 = 21b + 14$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the equation for a and b\nRearrange the equation to solve for one variable in terms of the other: $23a - 21b = 14 - 22$ which simplifies to $23a - 21b = -8$. This equation needs to be solved for integers $a$ and $b$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the linear Diophantine equation\nTo solve $23a - 21b = -8$, we can use methods for solving linear Diophantine equations. One approach is to find a particular solution and then the general solution. A particular solution can be found by inspection or by using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n## Step 5: Find a particular solution\nWe need to find integers $a$ and $b$ that satisfy $23a - 21b = -8$. By trial and error or using the Euclidean algorithm, we can find a particular solution. Let's simplify the equation to make it easier to find a solution.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify and solve\nThe equation can be rewritten as $23a = 21b - 8$. We are looking for integers $a$ and $b$ that satisfy this equation. Given the nature of the problem, we expect multiple solutions, but we are constrained by the fact that $N < 500$, which means $a$ and $b$ must be within certain limits.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem or inspect possible values\nSince $23$ and $21$ are relatively prime (their greatest common divisor is 1), the Chinese Remainder Theorem could be applied to find a unique solution modulo $23 \\times 21 = 483$. However, given the small range of possible values, we can also proceed by inspecting possible values or systematically checking values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy both $N = 23a + 22$ and $N = 21b + 14$.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the constraints and find the solution\nGiven that $N < 500$, we start by checking feasible values of $a$ and $b$ that make $N$ less than 500 and satisfy both equations. Since we are dealing with a relatively small number of people, manual checking or writing a small program to iterate through possible values of $a$ and $b$ can quickly yield the solution.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the solution\nLet's manually check some values. For $a = 1$, $N = 23*1 + 22 = 45$. For $b = 1$, $N = 21*1 + 14 = 35$. These do not match, so we continue. Because the numbers are small, and we are looking for a match that satisfies both conditions, we look for patterns or use trial and error efficiently.\n\n## Step 10: Apply trial and error efficiently\nWe need to find values of $a$ and $b$ where $23a + 22 = 21b + 14$. Simplifying, $23a - 21b = -8$. We can try values of $a$ and $b$ to see when this condition is met, keeping in mind that $N < 500$.\n\n## Step 11: Find the correct value of N\nAfter trial and error or a systematic approach, we find that a particular set of $a$ and $b$ satisfies the condition. Let's calculate: if we try $a = 4$, then $N = 23*4 + 22 = 92 + 22 = 114$. Checking if this satisfies the second condition, $114 = 21b + 14$, we solve for $b$: $114 - 14 = 21b$, which gives $100 = 21b$, and thus $b = 100 / 21$, which is not an integer. So, $a = 4$ does not give us an integer solution for $b$. We continue this process until we find a match.\n\n## Step 12: Solve for a and b\nLet's find the correct values. We know $23a - 21b = -8$. This can be rearranged as $23a = 21b - 8$. We are looking for integer solutions where $N < 500$. By checking values or using a more systematic approach to solve the linear Diophantine equation, we aim to find $a$ and $b$ that satisfy both conditions.\n\n## Step 13: Final calculation\nAfter calculating and checking values, we find that $a = 7$ and $b = 8$ satisfy the conditions because $23*7 + 22 = 161 + 22 = 183$ and $21*8 + 14 = 168 + 14 = 182$ do not match exactly due to a miscalculation in the steps. The correct approach should involve systematically solving the equation $23a - 21b = -8$ and checking for $N < 500$. The mistake was in the manual checking process. The correct method involves using the Chinese Remainder Theorem or a systematic approach to solve for $a$ and $b$ correctly.\n\n## Step 14: Correct the calculation\nTo find the correct solution, let's re-evaluate our approach. We need to solve $23a + 22 = 21b + 14$ for integers $a$ and $b$ where the total $N$ is less than 500. This involves finding the first few positive solutions to the linear Diophantine equation $23a - 21b = -8$ and selecting the one that satisfies $N < 500$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{413}$"

  "solution": "If $n$ is the number of people in the incoming class, then $n$ yields a remainder of $14$ when divided by $21$. Since both 21 and 14 are divisible by 7, this means that $n$ is divisible by $7$. Define $k=n/7$, and note that $7k \\equiv 14\\pmod{21}$. Dividing by 7, we get $k\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. Multiplying by 7 again, we get $n\\equiv 14\\pmod{3}$, which implies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$.
