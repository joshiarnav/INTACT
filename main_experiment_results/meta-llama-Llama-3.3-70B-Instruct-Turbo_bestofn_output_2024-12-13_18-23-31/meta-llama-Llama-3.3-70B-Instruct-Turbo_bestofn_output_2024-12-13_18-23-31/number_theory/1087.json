    "## Step 1: Convert the fraction to a decimal\nTo find the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{26}$, we perform long division. Dividing 3 by 26, we get a repeating decimal $0.115384615384...$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the repeating pattern\nThe repeating block in the decimal representation is $115384$. This block has 6 digits.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the position of the 100th digit\nSince the repeating block has 6 digits, we need to find where the 100th digit falls within this block. We do this by finding the remainder when 100 is divided by 6. $100 \\mod 6 = 4$. This means the 100th digit is the same as the 4th digit in the repeating block.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the 4th digit in the repeating block\nThe repeating block is $115384$. The 4th digit in this block is $3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",
    "## Step 1: Convert the fraction to a decimal\nTo find the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{26}$, we can divide the numerator by the denominator. Performing long division, we get $0.115384615384...$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the repeating pattern\nLooking at the decimal representation, we notice that the pattern $115384$ repeats. This is because $\\frac{3}{26}$ is a rational number with a repeating decimal.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the length of the repeating pattern\nThe length of the repeating pattern is $6$ digits, which is $115384$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the position of the 100th digit\nSince the pattern repeats every $6$ digits, we can divide $100$ by $6$ to find the number of complete cycles of the pattern. $100 \\div 6 = 16$ remainder $4$. This means the $100$th digit is the $4$th digit in the repeating pattern.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the 100th digit\nThe repeating pattern is $115384$. The $4$th digit in this pattern is $3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nTo find the $100$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{3}{26}$ is expressed as a decimal, we first need to convert the fraction into a decimal.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the fraction to decimal\nDividing $3$ by $26$ gives a repeating decimal. To find the repeating pattern, we perform long division.\n\n## Step 3: Perform long division\nPerforming long division of $3$ by $26$, we get $0.115384615384...$ as the decimal representation. The sequence $115384$ repeats.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the repeating pattern\nThe repeating pattern is $115384$. This pattern has $6$ digits.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the position of the 100th digit\nTo find the $100$th digit after the decimal point, we need to see where it falls within the repeating pattern. Since the pattern repeats every $6$ digits, we divide $100$ by $6$ to see how many complete patterns there are before reaching the $100$th digit.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the remainder\n$100 \\div 6 = 16$ remainder $4$. This means that the $100$th digit is the $4$th digit in the repeating pattern.\n\n## Step 7: Identify the 100th digit\nThe repeating pattern is $115384$. The $4$th digit in this pattern is $3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"

  "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block. We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$. Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{3}$.",
