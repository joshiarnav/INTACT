    "## Step 1: Understand the given equation\nThe equation $161_{b}+134_{b}=315_{b}$ implies that we are dealing with numbers in base $b$. To solve for $b$, we must convert these numbers into their decimal equivalents and solve the resulting equation.\n\n## Step 2: Convert $161_{b}$ to decimal\n$161_{b}$ in decimal form is $1 \\cdot b^2 + 6 \\cdot b^1 + 1 \\cdot b^0 = b^2 + 6b + 1$.\n\n## Step 3: Convert $134_{b}$ to decimal\n$134_{b}$ in decimal form is $1 \\cdot b^2 + 3 \\cdot b^1 + 4 \\cdot b^0 = b^2 + 3b + 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Convert $315_{b}$ to decimal\n$315_{b}$ in decimal form is $3 \\cdot b^2 + 1 \\cdot b^1 + 5 \\cdot b^0 = 3b^2 + b + 5$.\n\n## Step 5: Set up the equation using decimal equivalents\nSubstituting the decimal equivalents back into the original equation gives $(b^2 + 6b + 1) + (b^2 + 3b + 4) = 3b^2 + b + 5$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify and solve the equation\nSimplifying the equation yields $2b^2 + 9b + 5 = 3b^2 + b + 5$.\nMoving all terms to one side gives $0 = b^2 - 8b$.\nFactoring out $b$ yields $0 = b(b - 8)$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $b$\nThis gives two possible solutions for $b$: $b = 0$ or $b = 8$. However, $b$ cannot be 0 because it is the base of a number system, so $b = 8$ is the only valid solution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
    "## Step 1: Convert the given numbers to base 10 to make the equation comparable.\nFirst, let's express $161_{b}$, $134_{b}$, and $315_{b}$ in base 10. $161_{b}$ in base 10 is $1*b^2 + 6*b + 1$. $134_{b}$ in base 10 is $1*b^2 + 3*b + 4$. $315_{b}$ in base 10 is $3*b^2 + 1*b + 5$.\n\n## Step 2: Write the equation using the base 10 expressions.\nThe equation $161_{b}+134_{b}=315_{b}$ becomes $(1*b^2 + 6*b + 1) + (1*b^2 + 3*b + 4) = (3*b^2 + 1*b + 5)$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation.\nCombine like terms: $2*b^2 + 9*b + 5 = 3*b^2 + 1*b + 5$.\n\n## Step 4: Rearrange the equation to solve for $b$.\nSubtract $3*b^2 + 1*b + 5$ from both sides to get $-b^2 + 8*b = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Factor out $b$.\nFactor $b$ out of the equation: $b(-b + 8) = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $b$.\nThis gives two possible solutions: $b = 0$ or $-b + 8 = 0$, which means $b = 8$. Since $b$ represents the base of a number system, it cannot be 0. Thus, $b = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given equation in base $b$\nThe equation given is $161_{b}+134_{b}=315_{b}$. This means we are dealing with numbers in a base other than 10, and we need to find the value of $b$ that makes this equation true.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the numbers to the base 10 system for easier calculation\nTo solve for $b$, it's helpful to convert these base $b$ numbers into the base 10 system, so we can perform arithmetic operations easily. The base 10 values are calculated as follows:\n- $161_{b} = 1*b^2 + 6*b + 1$\n- $134_{b} = 1*b^2 + 3*b + 4$\n- $315_{b} = 3*b^2 + 1*b + 5$\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the base 10 representations\nSubstituting the base 10 representations back into the original equation gives:\n\\[1*b^2 + 6*b + 1 + 1*b^2 + 3*b + 4 = 3*b^2 + 1*b + 5\\]\n\n## Step 4: Simplify and solve the equation\nCombine like terms:\n\\[2*b^2 + 9*b + 5 = 3*b^2 + 1*b + 5\\]\nSubtract $3*b^2 + 1*b + 5$ from both sides to get:\n\\[-b^2 + 8*b = 0\\]\nFactoring out $b$ gives:\n\\[b(-b + 8) = 0\\]\nSo, $b = 0$ or $b = 8$. Since $b$ represents the base of a number system, it cannot be 0.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the valid solution for $b$\nGiven that $b$ must be a positive integer greater than the highest digit value used in the numbers (in this case, greater than 6), $b = 8$ is a valid solution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
