    "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nWe are given an addition problem where the digit represented by $\\triangle$ needs to be found. The problem is in base 6.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the units column\nLooking at the units column, we have $\\triangle + 0 + 2 = 1_6$. However, since we are working in base 6, the sum of $\\triangle + 2$ must be greater than or equal to 6 to result in a carry-over and end in 1.\n\n## Step 3: Determine possible values for $\\triangle$\nGiven that $\\triangle + 2$ results in a carry-over and the final digit is 1, we can deduce that $\\triangle + 2 = 7$ (in base 10) because $7_{10} = 11_6$, which would give us a 1 in the units place and a carry-over of 1.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $\\triangle$\nFrom $\\triangle + 2 = 7$, we subtract 2 from both sides to find $\\triangle = 5$.\n\n## Step 5: Verify the solution\nLet's verify that $\\triangle = 5$ satisfies the entire addition problem:\n$$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & 3 & 2 & 1 & 5_6\\\\ & & & 5 & 4 & 0_6\\\\ &+ & & & 5 & 2_6\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & 4 & 2 & 5 & 1_6\\\\ \\end{array} $$\nStarting from the right, $5 + 0 + 2 = 7_{10} = 11_6$, which gives us a 1 in the units place and a carry-over of 1.\nThe next column gives us $1 + 4 + 5 = 10_{10} = 14_6$, which results in 4 in the next place and a carry-over of 1.\nThen, $1 + 1 + 2 = 4_{10} = 4_6$, which fits perfectly.\nLastly, $3 + 0 = 3_{10} = 3_6$, but we have a carry-over, so it becomes $3 + 1 = 4_{10} = 4_6$, which matches the given sum.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
    "## Step 1: Analyzing the units column\nTo find the value of $\\triangle$, we first analyze the units column. In base 6, the sum of $\\triangle$, 0, and 2 must equal 1, considering any carry-over. Since $\\triangle + 0 + 2 = 1$ (in base 6), and given that $\\triangle$ must be a single digit in base 6, we have to consider the possibility of a carry-over from this addition.\n\n## Step 2: Considering the carry-over\nIn base 6, if $\\triangle + 2$ equals or exceeds 6, then a carry-over of 1 to the next column occurs. The only way $\\triangle + 2$ could result in a unit digit of 1 in base 6, considering a carry-over, is if $\\triangle + 2 = 7$ (in base 10), because 7 in base 10 is 11 in base 6. Thus, $\\triangle$ would be 5 in base 10, which is also 5 in base 6.\n\n## Step 3: Verifying the tens column\nNow, let's verify if $\\triangle = 5$ satisfies the tens column. The tens column involves adding 1 (from $\\triangle$), 4, and 5 (the value we're testing for $\\triangle$), along with any carry-over from the units column. Since we determined a carry-over of 1 from the units column, we add $1 + 4 + 5 + 1 = 11$ (in base 10). In base 6, 11 is written as 15. This means the tens column should have a 5 in the sum (which matches our target sum) and a carry-over of 1 to the hundreds column.\n\n## Step 4: Checking the hundreds column\nThe hundreds column involves adding 2 (from the top number), $\\triangle$ (which we're verifying as 5), and 0 (from the middle number), plus any carry-over. From the tens column, we have a carry-over of 1. So, $2 + 5 + 0 + 1 = 8$ (in base 10). In base 6, 8 is written as 12. This means the hundreds column should have a 2 in the sum (which matches our target sum) and a carry-over of 1 to the thousands column.\n\n## Step 5: Finalizing the thousands column\nThe thousands column involves adding 3 (from the top number), $\\triangle$ (which we've determined to be 5), and 0 (from the middle number, since there's no number in the thousands place for the middle or bottom numbers), plus any carry-over from the hundreds column. We have a carry-over of 1 from the hundreds column. So, $3 + 0 + 1 = 4$ (in base 10), which matches the target sum's thousands digit.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
    "## Step 1: Understanding the problem\nWe need to solve for the value of $\\triangle$ in the given base-6 addition problem.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the rightmost column\nLooking at the rightmost column, we see that $\\triangle + 0 + 2 = 1$ in base 6. This implies that $\\triangle + 2$ results in a number that ends in 1 in base 6.\n\n## Step 3: Considering base-6 arithmetic\nIn base 6, the only way for $\\triangle + 2$ to end in 1 is if $\\triangle + 2 = 11_6$ (since $11_6$ is the smallest number in base 6 that ends in 1 and is greater than 6). This would mean $\\triangle = 5$ because $5 + 2 = 11_6$ in base 6.\n\n## Step 4: Checking the third column from the right\nMoving to the third column from the right, we have $1 + 4 + \\triangle = \\triangle$ in base 6, considering any potential carry from the previous step. Since we've determined $\\triangle = 5$, substituting it in gives $1 + 4 + 5 = 14_6$. However, the sum in the result row for this column is $\\triangle$, which we're trying to confirm is 5. The calculation $1 + 4 + 5$ indeed equals $14_6$, and since the next column to the left must account for the carry, this step supports our choice of $\\triangle$ but let's ensure it fits the entire problem.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing the second column from the right with the carry\nThe second column from the right involves adding the carry from the previous step. Since $1 + 4 + 5 = 14_6$, we have a carry of 2 (because $14_6$ is $1*6^1 + 4*6^0$). So, in the second column, we're essentially adding $2 + \\triangle + 1$ (from the carry and the digits in that position), and this sum should match the result in the second column from the right. However, we need to account for the fact that our result row shows $\\triangle$ in the third position, which means the sum of $2 + \\triangle + 1$ must produce a carry that results in $\\triangle$ being the remainder when divided by 6.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluating the leftmost columns\nGiven $\\triangle = 5$, let's see how it fits the entire problem, especially focusing on the carry and the leftmost columns. If $\\triangle = 5$, then the column with $3$ and $\\triangle$ (which is $5$) being added with a carry must result in $4$ (as per the result row). This means $3 + 5 + carry = 4$ (in base 6), considering any carry from the previous addition.\n\n## Step 7: Final check with the carry\nGiven that $\\triangle = 5$, let's ensure it satisfies the entire equation, especially with carries. The rightmost column's calculation and the subsequent columns' calculations must align with base-6 arithmetic, including any carries. We've established that $\\triangle = 5$ seems plausible based on initial calculations, but ensuring it fits the entire problem is crucial.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"

  "solution": "We notice that in the units column, it's impossible for $\\triangle+2=1_6$. So, it must be the case that $\\triangle+2=11_6=7$. That would mean $\\triangle=7-2=\\boxed{5}$.
