    "## Step 1: Determine the condition for $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ to be an integer.\nFor $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ to be an integer, $2n - 1$ must be a factor of 20. This means $2n - 1$ has to be one of the divisors of 20, which are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm5, \\pm10, \\pm20$. However, since $2n - 1$ is odd, we only consider the odd divisors of 20, which are $\\pm1, \\pm5$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve for $n$ using the possible values of $2n - 1$.\nWe solve the equation $2n - 1 = d$ for each possible odd divisor $d$ of 20.\n- For $2n - 1 = 1$, we have $2n = 2$, so $n = 1$.\n- For $2n - 1 = -1$, we have $2n = 0$, so $n = 0$.\n- For $2n - 1 = 5$, we have $2n = 6$, so $n = 3$.\n- For $2n - 1 = -5$, we have $2n = -4$, so $n = -2$.\n\n## Step 3: Sum all the integer values of $n$ obtained.\nThe integer values of $n$ that satisfy the condition are $1, 0, 3, -2$. To find the sum, we add these values together: $1 + 0 + 3 - 2 = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

  "solution": "The expression $2n-1$ is odd for every integer $n$, and conversely every odd integer takes the form $2n-1$ for some integer $n$.  Therefore, there is one solution $n$ for each (not necessarily positive) odd divisor of 20.  The positive odd divisors of 20 are 1 and 5, so we solve $2n-1=-5$, $2n-1=-1$, $2n-1=1$, and $2n-1=5$ to find the solutions $n=-2$, $n=0$, $n=1$, and $n=3$.  These values for $n$ sum to $\\boxed{2}$.",
