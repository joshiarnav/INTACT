    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the smallest number that is divisible by all integers from 1 through 9. This means the number must be a multiple of each of these integers.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key factors\nTo find such a number, we should look at the prime factorization of each integer from 1 to 9, because the smallest number divisible by all these integers will be the least common multiple (LCM) of these integers.\n\n## Step 3: Prime factorization of integers 1 through 9\n- 1 doesn't contribute any prime factors since 1 is not considered a prime number.\n- 2 = 2\n- 3 = 3\n- 4 = 2^2\n- 5 = 5\n- 6 = 2 * 3\n- 7 = 7\n- 8 = 2^3\n- 9 = 3^2\n\n## Step 4: Determine the LCM\nTo find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number found in the factorizations:\n- The highest power of 2 is 2^3 (from 8).\n- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9).\n- We also include 5 and 7 since they are prime and not contained within other numbers' factorizations in higher powers.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the LCM\nLCM = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 = 8 * 9 * 5 * 7 = 2520.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2520}$"
