    "## Step 1: Identify the range of two-digit multiples of 7\nThe smallest two-digit multiple of 7 is 14, and the largest two-digit multiple of 7 is 98.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of terms in the sequence\nTo find the number of terms, we calculate the difference between the largest and smallest term, divide by the common difference (7), and then add 1. The sequence of two-digit multiples of 7 is 14, 21, ..., 98. The formula to find the number of terms (n) is given by: $n = \\frac{(\\text{last term} - \\text{first term})}{\\text{common difference}} + 1$. Applying this formula, $n = \\frac{98 - 14}{7} + 1 = \\frac{84}{7} + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the sum of the arithmetic series\nThe sum (S) of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula: $S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (\\text{first term} + \\text{last term})$. Substituting the known values, $S = \\frac{13}{2} \\times (14 + 98) = \\frac{13}{2} \\times 112 = 13 \\times 56 = 728$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the arithmetic mean\nThe arithmetic mean (average) is the sum of the terms divided by the number of terms. Using the sum calculated in Step 3 and the number of terms from Step 2, the mean is $\\frac{728}{13}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the mean\nCalculating the mean: $\\frac{728}{13} = 56$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{56}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the smallest and largest two-digit multiples of 7.\nThe smallest two-digit multiple of 7 is 14, and the largest two-digit multiple of 7 is 98.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of two-digit multiples of 7.\nTo find the number of terms, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the last term (98 in this case), $a_1$ is the first term (14), $n$ is the number of terms, and $d$ is the common difference (7 for multiples of 7). Plugging in the values, we get $98 = 14 + (n-1)7$. Simplifying, $98 - 14 = (n-1)7$, which gives $84 = (n-1)7$. Solving for $n$, we get $n-1 = 84 / 7 = 12$, so $n = 12 + 1 = 13$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the sum of all the two-digit multiples of 7.\nThe sum $S$ of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula $S = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term. Plugging in the values, we get $S = \\frac{13}{2}(14 + 98)$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression for the sum.\n$S = \\frac{13}{2}(14 + 98) = \\frac{13}{2}(112) = 13 \\times 56 = 728$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the arithmetic mean of the two-digit multiples of 7.\nThe arithmetic mean is the sum of the terms divided by the number of terms. So, the mean is $728 / 13$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression for the mean.\n$728 / 13 = 56$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{56}$",

Simplifying this equation yields $84 = (n-1)7$, and solving for $n$ gives $n = 13$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the sum of all the two-digit multiples of 7.\nThe sum $S_n$ of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$. Substituting $n = 13$, $a_1 = 14$, and $a_n = 98$ into this formula gives $S_{13} = \\frac{13}{2}(14 + 98) = \\frac{13}{2}(112) = 13 \\times 56 = 728$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the arithmetic mean of the two-digit multiples of 7.\nThe arithmetic mean is calculated by dividing the sum of the terms by the number of terms. Thus, the mean is $\\frac{728}{13}$. Calculating this gives the mean as $56$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{56}$"
