    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the smallest possible class size for a physical education class where students line up in four rows. Three of the rows have the same number of students, and one row has one more student than the other three.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the number of students in each row\nLet's denote the number of students in the three equal rows as x. The row with one more student will then have x + 1 students.\n\n## Step 3: Express the total number of students\nThe total number of students can be represented as the sum of the students in all four rows: 3x + (x + 1).\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression for the total number of students\nSimplifying the expression gives us 4x + 1.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the smallest possible class size\nSince the class has over 30 students, we need to find the smallest value of x that makes 4x + 1 greater than 30.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the inequality 4x + 1 > 30\nSubtract 1 from both sides of the inequality to get 4x > 29.\n\n## Step 7: Find the smallest integer value of x that satisfies the inequality\nDivide both sides by 4 to get x > 7.25. Since x must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a student), the smallest possible value for x is 8.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the smallest possible class size\nSubstitute x = 8 into the expression for the total number of students: 4x + 1 = 4*8 + 1 = 32 + 1 = 33.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{33}$",

The row with one more student will then have x + 1 students.\n\n## Step 3: Express the total number of students\nThe total number of students (T) can be expressed as the sum of the students in all four rows: T = x + x + x + (x + 1).\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression for the total number of students\nSimplifying the expression, we get T = 3x + (x + 1) = 4x + 1.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the smallest possible class size over 30\nSince the class has over 30 students, we need to find the smallest value of x that satisfies T > 30. We can start by testing the smallest possible values for x and calculate T until we find a value greater than 30.\n\n## Step 6: Test values of x\nStarting with x = 1, we get T = 4*1 + 1 = 5, which is less than 30.\nTrying x = 2, we get T = 4*2 + 1 = 9, still less than 30.\nTrying x = 3, we get T = 4*3 + 1 = 13, less than 30.\nTrying x = 4, we get T = 4*4 + 1 = 17, less than 30.\nTrying x = 5, we get T = 4*5 + 1 = 21, less than 30.\nTrying x = 6, we get T = 4*6 + 1 = 25, less than 30.\nTrying x = 7, we get T = 4*7 + 1 = 29, less than 30.\nTrying x = 8, we get T = 4*8 + 1 = 33, which is greater than 30.\n\n## Step 7: Identify the smallest possible class size\nThe smallest possible class size that satisfies the given conditions is when x = 8, resulting in a total of 33 students.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{33}$",

This simplifies to 4x + 1.\n\n## Step 4: Find the smallest class size with more than 30 students\nWe need to find the smallest integer value of x such that 4x + 1 > 30. To do this, we can solve the inequality 4x + 1 > 30 for x.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the inequality for x\nSubtract 1 from both sides of the inequality to get 4x > 29.

  "solution": "If the first three rows have 1 student, the last row must have two students, so there are 5 students in total. This is not greater than 30, so we must add another student to each row. This gives 9, which is still not greater than 30. We have to keep adding 4 until we get to a number greater than 30. As a result, we reach 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33. 33 is the first integer greater than 30, so this class has $\\boxed{33}$ students.",
