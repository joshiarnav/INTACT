    "## Step 1: Understand the sequence $a_n = n! + n$\nWe have a sequence defined by $a_n = n! + n$, where $n$ starts from $0$ and increases consecutively. To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two consecutive terms, we first need to calculate a few initial terms of the sequence to observe any patterns or properties that might help in determining the GCD.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate initial terms of the sequence\nLet's calculate the first few terms of the sequence:\n- $a_0 = 0! + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1$\n- $a_1 = 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$\n- $a_2 = 2! + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4$\n- $a_3 = 3! + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9$\n- $a_4 = 4! + 4 = 24 + 4 = 28$\n- $a_5 = 5! + 5 = 120 + 5 = 125$\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the GCD of consecutive terms\nNow, let's find the GCD of consecutive terms:\n- GCD($a_0, a_1$) = GCD(1, 2) = 1\n- GCD($a_1, a_2$) = GCD(2, 4) = 2\n- GCD($a_2, a_3$) = GCD(4, 9) = 1\n- GCD($a_3, a_4$) = GCD(9, 28) = 1\n- GCD($a_4, a_5$) = GCD(28, 125) = 1\n\n## Step 4: Determine the pattern for GCD\nFrom the calculated GCDs, we observe that after the first two terms, the GCD of consecutive terms tends to be 1 because the factorial component ($n!$) of each term makes it highly unlikely for consecutive terms to share common factors other than 1, especially as $n$ increases. The addition of $n$ to $n!$ does not introduce a consistent pattern that would increase the GCD beyond 1 for consecutive terms.\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion on maximum possible GCD value\nGiven the nature of the sequence and the observation from the initial terms, the maximum possible value of the GCD of two consecutive terms in the sequence $a_n = n! + n$ appears to be 2, which occurs between $a_1$ and $a_2$. For $n \\geq 2$, the factorial term dominates, and the chance of having a GCD greater than 1 with the next term becomes negligible due to the unique factorization of factorials and the addition of $n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

The exception seems to be when $n$ is small.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the effect of $n!$ on GCD\nAs $n$ increases, $n!$ becomes a larger and larger component of $a_n$, making it less likely for consecutive terms to share common factors greater than 1, since $n!$ includes the product of all positive integers up to $n$. This suggests that for higher values of $n$, the GCD of $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$ will typically be 1.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate GCD for small $n$\nGiven the sequence's nature, the highest GCD values between consecutive terms are likely to occur at small values of $n$, as seen with GCD($a_1, a_2$) = 2. For larger $n$, the factorial growth makes common factors (other than 1) unlikely.\n\n## Step 7: Conclusion on maximum GCD\nBased on the analysis, the maximum possible value of the GCD of two consecutive terms in the sequence $a_n = n! + n$ appears to be 2, observed between $a_1$ and $a_2$. For larger $n$, the nature of the factorial function makes it improbable to have a GCD greater than 1 due to the unique and increasing factors introduced by $n!$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the sequence given\nThe sequence given is $a_n = n! + n$, where $n \\ge 0$. This means the first few terms of the sequence are $a_0 = 0! + 0 = 1$, $a_1 = 1! + 1 = 2$, $a_2 = 2! + 2 = 4$, $a_3 = 3! + 3 = 9$, $a_4 = 4! + 4 = 28$, and so on.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the definition of the greatest common divisor (GCD)\nThe greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers without a remainder. For two consecutive terms of the sequence, we need to find the GCD of $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the potential GCD for consecutive terms\nTo find the maximum possible value of the GCD of two consecutive terms, let's examine the relationship between $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$. Given $a_n = n! + n$ and $a_{n+1} = (n+1)! + (n+1)$, we can see that $a_{n+1}$ will always be larger due to the nature of factorial growth.\n\n## Step 4: Use the Euclidean algorithm concept\nThe Euclidean algorithm states that the GCD of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number. Therefore, we can consider the difference $a_{n+1} - a_n$ to simplify our calculation.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the difference $a_{n+1} - a_n$\nThe difference is $a_{n+1} - a_n = (n+1)! + (n+1) - (n! + n)$. Simplifying, we get $a_{n+1} - a_n = (n+1)! - n! + 1$. Since $(n+1)! = (n+1) \\cdot n!$, we can further simplify to $a_{n+1} - a_n = n! \\cdot (n+1 - 1) + 1 = n! \\cdot n + 1 = n \\cdot n! + 1$.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the GCD of $a_n$ and $a_{n+1} - a_n$\nSince $a_{n+1} - a_n = n \\cdot n! + 1$, and $a_n = n! + n$, we are looking for the GCD of $n! + n$ and $n \\cdot n! + 1$. Notice that $n \\cdot n! + 1$ will always be relatively prime to $n!$ because it's $n!$ multiplied by $n$ plus 1, meaning it shares no common factors with $n!$ itself except for 1.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the maximum possible GCD\nFor $n = 1$, $a_1 = 2$ and $a_2 = 4$. The GCD of 2 and 4 is 2. For $n > 1$, because $n!$ grows so rapidly and $n \\cdot n! + 1$ will not share any factors with $n! + n$ (as adding 1 to a multiple of $n!$ ensures it's not divisible by any factor of $n!$), the GCD will typically be 1 for larger $n$ due to the nature of factorials making each term relatively prime to its consecutive term.\n\n## Step 8: Identify any special cases\nGiven the nature of the sequence and the rapid growth of factorials, special cases where the GCD is greater than 1 are unlikely for larger $n$. However, we've identified $n=1$ as a potential special case where the GCD is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"

  "solution": "We start by taking the first step in the Euclidean algorithm: subtract the initial two terms. Notice that\n\\begin{align*}a_{n+1} - (n+1)a_n &= (n+1)! + n + 1 - (n+1)(n! + n) \\\\ &= (n+1)! + n + 1 - (n+1)! - n(n+1) \\\\ &= -n^2 + 1 = -(n-1)(n+1).\n\\end{align*}It follows that by the Euclidean Algorithm, \\begin{align*}\\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, a_{n+1}) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, a_{n+1} - (n+1)a_n)\\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, (n-1)(n+1)),\\end{align*}since the minus sign is irrelevant for calculating the gcd.\n\nWe know that $n-1$ divides $n!$, so that $n-1$ is relatively prime to $a_n = n! + n$:\n$$\\text{gcd}\\,(n-1,n!+n) = \\text{gcd}\\,(n-1,n) = 1.$$Thus, we can ignore the factor of $n-1$ completely, and say that\n$$\\text{gcd}\\,(a_n,a_{n+1}) = \\text{gcd}\\,(n! + n, n+1).$$Now, we have several cases, depending on whether $n+1$ is prime or composite. We also have a few edge cases to consider. The basic idea is that when $n+1$ is composite and greater than $4$, $n+1$ is a factor of $n!$, whereas when $n+1$ is prime, we can apply Wilson's Theorem.\n\n$\\textit{Case 0:}$ For $n = 0$, we find that $a_0 = 1, a_1 = 2$, with greatest common divisor $1$.\n\n$\\textit{Case composite:}$\n\n$\\qquad \\textit{Subcase 1:}$ If $n+1$ is composite and can be written as the product of two distinct integers greater than $1$ (say $n+1 = a \\times b$, $a > b > 1$), then $n+1$ divides\n$$n! = 1 \\times \\cdots \\times b \\times \\cdots \\times a \\times \\cdots \\times n.$$By the same argument as before, since $n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime, then $n! + n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime, yielding a greatest common divisor of $1$.\n\n$\\qquad \\textit{Subcase 2:}$ If $n+1 = p^2$ for some prime $p$, then $n! + n = (p^2 - 1)! + p^2-1$. If $2p < p^2 - 1$, then $p$ and $2p$ are both factors that appear in the expansion of $n!$, so $n+1$ divides $n!$ and the previous argument applies. For $p = 2$, we can quickly check that $3! + 3 = 9$ is relatively prime with $4$.\n\n$\\textit{Case prime:}$ If $n + 1 = p$ for some prime $p$, then $n! + n \\equiv (p-1)! + (p-1) \\equiv -2 \\pmod{p}$ by Wilson's Theorem. Thus, $n! + n$ is relatively prime with $n+1$ unless $n = 1$, for which we obtain $a_1 = 2, a_2 = 4$, with greatest common divisor 2.\n\nSo, the largest the greatest common divisor of two consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n$ can be is $\\boxed{2}$, which is achieved when we take $n=1$.",
