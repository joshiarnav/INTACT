    "## Step 1: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive multiple of 25 where the product of its digits is also a multiple of 25.\nWe know that a number is a multiple of 25 if it ends in 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since we're looking for the least positive multiple, we should start with the smallest possibilities.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the possibilities for the last two digits.\nThe last two digits must be 25 or 75 for the number to be a multiple of 25 and have a digit product that could be a multiple of 25, since 0 multiplied by any number is 0, and 50 does not contain a 5, which is necessary for a product to be a multiple of 25.\n\n## Step 3: Look at the digit product requirement.\nFor the product of the digits to be a multiple of 25, we need at least two digits that when multiplied give us a multiple of 25. This could be achieved with two 5s (since 5*5 = 25), or any combination that includes at least one 5 and another number that when multiplied by 5 gives a multiple of 25.\n\n## Step 4: Explore numbers ending in 25.\nStarting with the smallest multiple of 25 that could meet the criteria, we look at numbers ending in 25. However, a single 5 is not enough to make the product of digits a multiple of 25 unless there's another 5.\n\n## Step 5: Explore numbers ending in 75.\nFor numbers ending in 75, the product of the digits would be 7*5 = 35, which is not a multiple of 25. So, we need to consider other digits that when included would make the product a multiple of 25.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the smallest multiple of 25 with two 5s.\nThe smallest number that comes to mind which is a multiple of 25 and includes two 5s is 525. Here, 5*2*5 = 50, which is a multiple of 25.\n\n## Step 7: Verify if 525 meets all the criteria.\n525 is a multiple of 25 because it ends in 25, and the product of its digits (5*2*5) is 50, which is also a multiple of 25.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{525}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the requirements of the problem\nTo find the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25, we need to analyze the properties of multiples of 25 and how they relate to the product of their digits.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize the properties of multiples of 25\nMultiples of 25 always end in 00, 25, 50, or 75. This is because 25 is a factor of 100, so when multiplying 25 by any integer, the last two digits can only be certain combinations that reflect the multiplication pattern of 25.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the product of digits for multiples of 25\nFor the product of the digits of a number to be a multiple of 25, the number must contain at least one 5 (since 5 is a prime factor of 25). Additionally, because 25 requires two factors of 5 to be considered a multiple, the digits must include at least two 5s or a combination of digits that when multiplied give a multiple of 25.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze possible smallest multiples of 25\nStarting with the smallest multiples of 25 and considering the digits' product:\n- 25 itself does not have a product of digits that is a multiple of 25 (2*5 = 10).\n- 50 also does not (5*0 = 0, which is a multiple but not positive).\n- 75 has a product of digits that is a multiple of 25 (7*5 = 35, which is not a multiple of 25).\n- 100 has a product of digits that is 0 (1*0*0 = 0), which is a multiple but not positive.\n\n## Step 5: Explore combinations that include 5 and meet the criteria\nConsidering numbers that end in 25 (since they are multiples of 25 and include a 5), and looking for the smallest one where the product of the digits is also a multiple of 25:\n- The number 525 is a multiple of 25, and its digits' product (5*2*5 = 50) is also a multiple of 25.\n\n## Step 6: Confirm the solution\n525 meets both criteria: it is a multiple of 25, and the product of its digits (50) is also a multiple of 25. Since we are looking for the least positive multiple, and starting from the lowest multiples of 25, 525 is indeed the smallest number that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{525}$",

  "solution": "Every multiple of 25 ends in 00, 25, 50, or 75.  Since we want the product of the digits to be a positive multiple of 25, the final two digits must be either 25 or 75.\n\nA nonzero product of digits is a multiple of 25 exactly when two or more of the digits is are equal to 5. If a number ends in 75 and the product of its digits is a multiple of 25, then replacing 75 by 25 in that number will also give a smaller number whose product of digits is a multiple of 25.  Therefore we are looking for a number whose final two digits are 25 and for which 5 is one of the other digits.\n\nSince 525 is the smallest such number, the answer must be $\\boxed{525}$.",
