    "## Step 1: Understand the divisibility rule for 9\nA number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. This means that for the number $D\\,767\\,E89$ to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits $D + 7 + 6 + 7 + E + 8 + 9$ must be divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 2: Express the sum of the digits\nThe sum of the digits can be expressed as $D + 7 + 6 + 7 + E + 8 + 9 = D + E + 37$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the condition for divisibility by 9\nFor $D\\,767\\,E89$ to be divisible by 9, $D + E + 37$ must be divisible by 9. This means $D + E + 37$ is equal to a multiple of 9.\n\n## Step 4: Find the possible values of $D + E + 37$\nSince $D + E + 37$ must be divisible by 9, the possible values for $D + E + 37$ include 45 (which is $9 \\times 5$) and 54 (which is $9 \\times 6$), because 37 is between 36 (which is $9 \\times 4$) and 45.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the possible values of $D + E$\nIf $D + E + 37 = 45$, then $D + E = 45 - 37 = 8$. If $D + E + 37 = 54$, then $D + E = 54 - 37 = 17$.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the range of D and E\nBoth $D$ and $E$ are single-digit numbers, meaning they can range from 0 to 9. However, $D$ cannot be 0 since it is the leading digit of the number. Thus, $D$ ranges from 1 to 9, and $E$ ranges from 0 to 9.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the validity of $D + E = 8$ and $D + E = 17$\nFor $D + E = 8$, given that $D$ and $E$ are single digits and $D$ must be at least 1, this sum is valid (e.g., $D = 1, E = 7$ or $D = 2, E = 6$). For $D + E = 17$, considering $D$ and $E$ are single digits, this sum is also valid (e.g., $D = 8, E = 9$ or $D = 9, E = 8$).\n\n## Step 8: Sum all possible values of $D + E$\nThe possible values for $D + E$ are 8 and 17. Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $D + E$ is $8 + 17 = 25$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{25}$"

  "solution": "For $D\\,767\\,E89$ to be divisible by $9,$ we must have $$D+7+6+7+E+8+9 = 37+D+E$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $D$ and $E$ are each a single digit, we know each is between $0$ and $9.$ Therefore, $D+E$ is between $0$ and $18.$ Therefore, $37+D+E$ is between $37$ and $55.$ The numbers between $37$ and $55$ that are divisible by $9$ are $45$ and $54.$\n\nIf $37+D+E=45,$ then $D+E=8.$\n\nIf $37+D+E=54,$ then $D+E=17.$\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $D+E$ are $8$ and $17.$ Our answer is then $8+17=\\boxed{25}.$",
