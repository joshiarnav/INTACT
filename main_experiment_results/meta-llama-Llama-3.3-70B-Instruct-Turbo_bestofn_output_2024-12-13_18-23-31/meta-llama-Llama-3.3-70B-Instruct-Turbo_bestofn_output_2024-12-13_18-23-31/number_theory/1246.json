    "## Step 1: Prime factorization of 432\nTo find the sum of the proper divisors of 432, we first need to find its prime factorization. The prime factorization of 432 is $2^4 \\cdot 3^3$.\n\n## Step 2: Understanding the formula for sum of divisors\nThe sum of divisors, including the number itself, can be calculated using the formula $(1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + ... + p_1^{a_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + ... + p_2^{a_2})$, where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are prime factors of the number and $a_1$ and $a_2$ are their respective powers.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the sum of divisors for 432\nUsing the formula, we calculate the sum of all divisors for 432. For the prime factor 2 with a power of 4, the sum is $1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31$. For the prime factor 3 with a power of 3, the sum is $1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40$. Therefore, the total sum of divisors is $31 \\cdot 40 = 1240$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of proper divisors\nThe sum of proper divisors is the total sum of divisors minus the number itself. So, we subtract 432 from 1240 to find the sum of the proper divisors.\n\n## Step 5: Final calculation\nSum of proper divisors = Total sum of divisors - The number itself = 1240 - 432 = 808.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{808}$",
    "## Step 1: Find the prime factorization of 432\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of 432. We start by dividing 432 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. We get 216. Continuing, 216 is also divisible by 2, giving 108. Repeating, 108 is divisible by 2, giving 54. Again, 54 is divisible by 2, giving 27. Now, 27 is not divisible by 2, but it is divisible by 3, giving 9. Then, 9 is divisible by 3, giving 3. Lastly, 3 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 432 is $2^4 \\cdot 3^3$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the sum of the divisors of 432\nTo calculate the sum of the divisors, we use the formula that involves the prime factorization. For a number in the form of $a^m \\cdot b^n$, where $a$ and $b$ are prime numbers and $m$ and $n$ are their powers, the sum of its divisors is calculated by $(1 + a + a^2 + ... + a^m)(1 + b + b^2 + ... + b^n)$. Applying this to $432 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^3$, the sum of the divisors is $(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4)(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3)$.\n\n## Step 3: Compute the sum of the powers of 2\nCalculate the sum of the powers of 2: $1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31$.\n\n## Step 4: Compute the sum of the powers of 3\nCalculate the sum of the powers of 3: $1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total sum of the divisors\nMultiply the sums from step 3 and step 4 to get the total sum of the divisors: $31 \\cdot 40 = 1240$.\n\n## Step 6: Subtract the number itself to get the sum of the proper divisors\nSince we are asked for the sum of the proper divisors, we need to subtract 432 from the total sum of the divisors: $1240 - 432 = 808$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{808}$",
