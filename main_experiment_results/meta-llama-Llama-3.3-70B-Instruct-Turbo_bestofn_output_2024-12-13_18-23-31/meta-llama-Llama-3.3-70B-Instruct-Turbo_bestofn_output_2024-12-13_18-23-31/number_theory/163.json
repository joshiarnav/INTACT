    "## Step 1: Determine the smallest possible four-digit number.\nThe smallest four-digit number is 1000.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the requirements for the number.\nThe number must be divisible by 9, have two even digits, and have two odd digits.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the divisibility rule for 9.\nA number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 4: Start with the smallest possible digits to form the smallest number.\nTo achieve the smallest possible number, we should start with 1 as the first odd digit, since starting with 0 would not make it a four-digit number.\n\n## Step 5: Choose the next smallest odd digit.\nThe next smallest odd digit after 1 is 3.\n\n## Step 6: Choose the smallest even digits.\nThe smallest even digits are 0 and 2, but since we need a four-digit number, 0 cannot be the first digit. However, it can be one of the other digits.\n\n## Step 7: Arrange the digits to form the smallest possible number that meets the criteria.\nConsidering the need for a small number and the requirements, a possible arrangement could be 1023, but we need to ensure the sum of the digits is divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 8: Check if 1023 meets the divisibility rule for 9.\n1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is not divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 9: Find the next possible arrangement that increases the sum to be divisible by 9.\nIncreasing the digits slightly while keeping the number as small as possible, we could consider arrangements like 1089, which has two even (0, 8) and two odd digits (1, 9).\n\n## Step 10: Check if 1089 meets the divisibility rule for 9.\n1 + 0 + 8 + 9 = 18, which is divisible by 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1089}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the requirements for the number\nThe number must be a four-digit number, divisible by 9, and have two even and two odd digits.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the divisibility rule of 9\nA number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 3: Find the smallest possible digits to form the number\nTo minimize the number, we should start with the smallest digits. For even digits, the smallest are 0 and 2. For odd digits, the smallest are 1 and 3, but since we need to ensure the number is a four-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0.\n\n## Step 4: Consider possible combinations of digits\nGiven the constraints, a possible combination that minimizes the value while ensuring it's a four-digit number could involve starting with '1' (the smallest odd digit that can be used as the first digit) and then distributing the other digits to meet the criteria.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the divisibility rule of 9\nWe must find a combination where the sum of the digits is divisible by 9. Starting with '1' as the first digit, we can explore combinations like 1, 0, 2, and an odd digit that, when summed, give a multiple of 9.\n\n## Step 6: Test a potential combination\nA potential smallest combination could be 1 (odd), 0 (even), 2 (even), and an odd digit to make the sum divisible by 9. Let's find the smallest odd digit 'x' that makes 1 + 0 + 2 + x divisible by 9. This gives us 3 + x = 9n, where n is an integer. The smallest 'x' to make this true is when 3 + x = 9, giving x = 6, which is even, not odd. We made a mistake in assuming we could use 1, 0, 2, and another digit to get the smallest number. We need to reconsider the digits to ensure we have two even and two odd digits and the sum is divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 7: Reconsider the combination with the correct approach\nLet's consider the sum of digits again with a focus on meeting all criteria. The smallest four-digit number starts with '1'. To ensure divisibility by 9 and meet the even/odd requirement, we could look at combinations like 1, 2, 3, and another digit 'x' that makes the sum divisible by 9. The sum of 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and to reach the next multiple of 9 (which is 9), 'x' would need to be 3. However, this doesn't meet the even/odd distribution requirement as it would be 1, 2, 3, 3, which doesn't have two even digits. Let's correct our approach to ensure we're considering the requirements properly.\n\n## Step 8: Correct approach to meeting all criteria\nWe need two even and two odd digits, and the number must be divisible by 9. Starting with '1' as the smallest possible first digit (odd), we can select '2' as one of the even digits to keep the number small. For the sum of digits to be divisible by 9, and ensuring we have two odd and two even digits, let's consider other combinations that meet these criteria, such as using '0' and '8' as the even digits (since 0 cannot be the first digit, it's a good candidate for one of the other digits), and '1' and '9' as the odd digits, which sums up to 18, divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 9: Finalize the smallest number meeting all criteria\nThe combination 1, 0, 8, 9 meets all the criteria: it's a four-digit number, has two even (0, 8) and two odd digits (1, 9), and the sum of its digits (1 + 0 + 8 + 9 = 18) is divisible by 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1089}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the requirements for the number\nThe number must be a four-digit positive integer, divisible by 9, and have two even and two odd digits.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the divisibility rule for 9\nA number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the smallest possible four-digit number\nThe smallest four-digit number is 1000.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the even and odd digit requirement\nTo have two even and two odd digits, we could start with the smallest even and odd digits (0, 2, 1, 3) but we need to ensure the number is divisible by 9 and is the smallest possible four-digit number.\n\n## Step 5: Find the smallest set of digits that sum to a multiple of 9\nStarting with 1000, we try to find the smallest digits that satisfy the conditions. However, 1, 0, 0, 0 sum to 1, which is not divisible by 9. The smallest possible sum divisible by 9, considering we need two even and two odd digits and aiming for the smallest possible number, would be 9 itself.\n\n## Step 6: Construct a four-digit number with the smallest possible digits that meet all criteria\nThe digits 0, 1, 8, and 0 sum to 9, which is divisible by 9. However, we need to construct the smallest possible four-digit number with these digits, ensuring we have two even and two odd digits. The smallest arrangement that makes sense is 1080, but this does not meet the requirement of having two even and two odd digits since it has three even/zero digits and only one odd digit.\n\n## Step 7: Adjust the digits to meet the even/odd requirement\nConsidering the requirement for two even and two odd digits, and the need for the number to be divisible by 9, let's adjust our approach. A suitable set could be 0, 2, 7, and 0 because 0 + 2 + 7 + 0 = 9, which is divisible by 9, but again, this doesn't meet the even/odd requirement properly due to the repetition of 0.\n\n## Step 8: Find the correct smallest digits that meet all the criteria\nA correct and minimal set that meets the divisibility requirement and the even/odd digit distribution could involve the digits 0, 8 (for the even), and 1, 0 (initially thought for odd, but 0 is even), realizing we made another mistake in distribution. Let's correct the approach by considering 1, 8 (odd and even), and then finding another pair that keeps the sum at 9 or a multiple of 9. A correct minimal set is actually 1, 8, 0, and 0, which sums to 9, but we recognize the error in distribution again.\n\n## Step 9: Correct the distribution of even and odd digits\nTo correct our distribution, let's think of the smallest possible digits again with the right distribution: two even (0, 8) and two odd (1, 0 is not odd, so let's adjust). If we take 0 and 8 as our even digits, we need two odd digits that, when added to 0 + 8 = 8, give us a sum divisible by 9. So, 8 (from 0 + 8) + 1 + 0 does not work because 0 is not odd. Let's reconsider with the smallest odd digits that can make this work: 1 and 7 (since 1 + 7 + 0 + 1 does not meet our initial distribution of exactly two even and two odd, we adjust our thinking).\n\n## Step 10: Finalize the correct smallest digits\nConsidering the errors in previous steps, the focus should be on achieving a sum of digits divisible by 9 with the correct distribution of even and odd digits. A correct approach involves selecting digits that are minimal and meet both the divisibility and parity requirements. Let's think about using 1 and 7 for the odd digits (summing to 8), and then selecting even digits that, when added to 8, result in a sum divisible by 9. Since 8 + 1 = 9, we actually have a simple solution with 1, 7 (odd), and 0, 1 (but we've repeated the digit 1 and not correctly distributed even/odd yet).\n\n## Step 11: Construct the smallest number that meets all criteria\nRealizing the mistakes in distribution, the correct and minimal approach is to consider what smallest digits can give us a sum of 9 (or a multiple of 9) with two even and two odd digits. The correct smallest digits to consider should be 1, 8 (sums to 9, but we need two even and two odd), which was an oversight. Considering again, for a sum of 9 with the right distribution: 0 (even), 8 (even), 1 (odd), and to keep it minimal and divisible by 9, another odd digit that keeps the sum at 9 or the next multiple. Since we are aiming for the smallest four-digit number, let's correct our understanding of what digits to use.\n\n## Step 12: Final correction and construction\nGiven the aim for a four-digit number, divisible by 9, with two even and two odd digits, and considering our mistakes in distribution, let's finalize with the correct smallest digits: 0, 8 (even), and for the odd, 1 and 0 (no, because 0 is even). Correctly, we should look at the smallest possible odd digits that can complement our even digits to make a sum divisible by 9. If we use 1 and 7 (odd digits), and 0 and 1 (but we need another even), realizing the confusion, the simplest correct set that meets all criteria and corrects the oversight is actually having the digits 1, 7, 0, and 1, which does not correctly meet our even/odd distribution due to repetition and incorrect assignment of parity.\n\n## Step 13: Correct assignment of digits for the smallest number\nTo meet all criteria correctly: the smallest four-digit number, divisible by 9, with exactly two even and two odd digits, let's correctly assign the digits without repetition and ensuring divisibility by 9. Considering the smallest possible digits again and correcting for the distribution: 1 (odd), 7 (odd), 0 (even), and 1 (no, because we've repeated and not met the even requirement correctly).\n\n## Step 14: Finalize with the correct digits and their placement\nFor the smallest possible four-digit number that is divisible by 9 and has two even and two odd digits, considering all corrections, let's place the digits correctly: we need a sum divisible by 9. The digits 0, 8, 1, and 0 sum to 9, but do not meet the distribution requirement correctly because of the repetition of 0. The correct approach is finding the smallest digits that meet the sum requirement and the parity distribution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1089}$"

  "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$.",
