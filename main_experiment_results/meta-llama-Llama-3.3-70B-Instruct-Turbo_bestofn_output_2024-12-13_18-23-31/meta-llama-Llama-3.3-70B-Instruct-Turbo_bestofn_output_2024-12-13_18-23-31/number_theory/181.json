    "## Step 1: Identify the range of prime numbers between 20 and 30.\nThe prime numbers between 20 and 30 are 23 and 29.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the division and remainder concept.\nWhen a number $n$ is divided by 8 and leaves a remainder of 5, it can be represented as $n = 8k + 5$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the division and remainder concept to the prime numbers in the given range.\nLet's start with the first prime number, 23, and check if it satisfies the given condition.\nFor $n = 23$, we have $23 = 8k + 5$. Solving for $k$, we get $k = (23 - 5)/8 = 18/8 = 2.25$, which is not an integer.\n\n## Step 4: Check the second prime number.\nFor $n = 29$, we have $29 = 8k + 5$. Solving for $k$, we get $k = (29 - 5)/8 = 24/8 = 3$, which is an integer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{29}$",

This means $n$ can be represented as $n = 8k + 5$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\n## Step 3: Test the prime numbers in the given range against the remainder condition.\nFor $n = 23$: $23 = 8(2) + 7$. This does not satisfy the remainder condition of leaving a remainder of 5 when divided by 8.\nFor $n = 29$: $29 = 8(3) + 5$. This satisfies the remainder condition.\n\n## Step 4: Select the prime number that satisfies the condition.\nFrom the testing in step 3, $n = 29$ is the prime number that satisfies the given condition.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{29}$",

  "solution": "We look at multiples of 8 greater than 15 and less than 25 (since adding 5 should make the number between 20 and 30). So the multiples of 8 that we consider are 16 and 24. Adding 5, we get 21 and 29. Only 29 is a prime number so $n=\\boxed{29}$.\n\nOR\n\nWhen we divide 20 by 8, we get a remainder of 4. That means 21 will have a remainder of 5. The next number with a remainder of 5 would be $21+8=29$. When we consider 21 and 29, $\\boxed{29}$ is the prime number.",
