    "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nWe need to find the sum of the digits of the decimal representation of $2^{2005} \\times 5^{2007} \\times 3$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the expression\nFirst, let's simplify the given expression. $2^{2005} \\times 5^{2007} \\times 3$ can be rewritten as $2^{2005} \\times 5^{2005} \\times 5^{2} \\times 3$.\n\n## Step 3: Further simplification\nSince $2^{2005} \\times 5^{2005}$ equals $10^{2005}$, the expression can be further simplified to $10^{2005} \\times 5^{2} \\times 3$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $5^{2} \\times 3$\nNow, we calculate $5^{2} \\times 3$, which equals $25 \\times 3 = 75$.\n\n## Step 5: Multiply by $10^{2005}$\nTo find the decimal representation, we multiply $75$ by $10^{2005}$. This results in a number with $2005$ zeros after $75$, which is $75$ followed by $2005$ zeros.\n\n## Step 6: Find the sum of the digits\nThe sum of the digits of the decimal representation of $2^{2005} \\times 5^{2007} \\times 3$ is $7 + 5 = 12$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",

    "## Step 1: Identify the key components of the problem\nThe problem asks for the sum of the digits of the decimal representation of $2^{2005} \\times 5^{2007} \\times 3$. To simplify this, we should first look for any patterns or simplifications that can be made.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the expression using exponent properties\nNotice that $2^{2005} \\times 5^{2007}$ can be simplified by combining $2^{2005}$ and $5^{2005}$ into $10^{2005}$, since $2 \\times 5 = 10$. This leaves us with $5^2$ (or $25$) from $5^{2007}$ after combining $5^{2005}$ with $2^{2005}$ to get $10^{2005}$. Thus, the expression simplifies to $10^{2005} \\times 25 \\times 3$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the remaining multiplication\nNow, we multiply the remaining numbers: $25 \\times 3 = 75$. So, the expression further simplifies to $10^{2005} \\times 75$.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the effect of $10^{2005}$ on the decimal representation\n$10^{2005}$ is a large power of 10, which means it will shift the decimal point of the number it multiplies by 2005 places to the right. However, since we are only concerned with the sum of the digits, we can ignore the power of 10 because it does not change the sum of the digits of the number it multiplies (it merely adds zeros, which do not contribute to the sum of digits).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the sum of the digits of the relevant part\nThe relevant part for the sum of digits is $75$. The sum of the digits of $75$ is $7 + 5 = 12$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
