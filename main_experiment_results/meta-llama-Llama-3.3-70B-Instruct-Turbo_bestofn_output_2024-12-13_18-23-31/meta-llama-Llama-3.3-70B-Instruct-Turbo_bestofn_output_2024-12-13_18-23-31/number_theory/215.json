    "## Step 1: Determine the pattern of units digits for powers of 13\nTo find the units digit of $13^{2003}$, we first look for a pattern in the units digits of powers of 13. The units digit of $13^1$ is 3.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the units digits of higher powers of 13\nWe continue by calculating the units digits of $13^2$, $13^3$, $13^4$, and so on, to identify any repeating pattern. $13^2 = 169$, so the units digit is 9. $13^3 = 2197$, so the units digit is 7. $13^4 = 28561$, so the units digit is 1. $13^5 = 371293$, so the units digit is 3. We observe that the units digits repeat in a cycle: 3, 9, 7, 1.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the length of the cycle for the units digits of powers of 13\nFrom the calculations, we see that the cycle of units digits for powers of 13 is 3, 9, 7, 1, and it repeats every 4 powers. This means that for any power of 13, the units digit depends on the remainder when the exponent is divided by 4.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the remainder when 2003 is divided by 4\nTo find the units digit of $13^{2003}$, we need to find the remainder when 2003 is divided by 4. 2003 divided by 4 gives a quotient of 500 and a remainder of 3.\n\n## Step 5: Use the remainder to find the units digit of $13^{2003}$\nSince the remainder is 3, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is the same as the units digit of $13^3$. We already calculated that the units digit of $13^3$ is 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the pattern of units digits for powers of 13\nTo find the units digit of $13^{2003}$, we first need to observe the pattern of units digits when raising 13 to various powers. The units digit of $13^1$ is 3.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the units digit for higher powers of 13\nWe continue by calculating the units digit for higher powers of 13 to identify a pattern. For $13^2$, the units digit is 9 (since $13^2 = 169$), for $13^3$, the units digit is 7 (since $13^3 = 2197$), and for $13^4$, the units digit is 1 (since $13^4 = 28561$).\n\n## Step 3: Identify the repeating pattern\nAfter $13^4$, the pattern repeats because $13^5$ has a units digit of 3 (since $13^5 = 13 \\times 13^4$), which is the same as $13^1$. Thus, the pattern of units digits for powers of 13 is 3, 9, 7, 1 and it repeats every 4 powers.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the pattern to $13^{2003}$\nGiven that the pattern repeats every 4 powers, we divide 2003 by 4 to find the remainder. 2003 divided by 4 gives a quotient of 500 with a remainder of 3. This means that $13^{2003}$ will have the same units digit as $13^3$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the units digit of $13^{2003}$\nSince $13^3$ has a units digit of 7, $13^{2003}$ also has a units digit of 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",

  "solution": "Powers of 13 have the same units digit as the corresponding powers of 3; and $$\n3^1 = 3, \\quad 3^2 = 9, \\quad 3^3 = 27, \\quad 3^4 = 81, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 3^5 = 243.\n$$Since the units digit of $3^1$ is the same as the units digit of $3^5$, units digits of powers of 3 cycle through $3, 9, 7,$ and $1$. Hence the units digit of $3^{2000}$ is $1$, so the units digit of $3^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$. The same is true of the units digit of $13^{2003}$.",
