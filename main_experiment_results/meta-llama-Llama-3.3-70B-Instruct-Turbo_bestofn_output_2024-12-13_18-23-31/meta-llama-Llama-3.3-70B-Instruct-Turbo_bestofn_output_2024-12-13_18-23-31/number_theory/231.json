    "## Step 1: Convert the decimal number to base-4\nTo find the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$, we will divide the number by 4 and keep track of the remainders. The remainders will represent the digits in the base-4 representation, with the last remainder being the rightmost digit.\n\n## Step 2: Perform the division\nDivide 233 by 4:\n- $233 \\div 4 = 58$ remainder 1\n- $58 \\div 4 = 14$ remainder 2\n- $14 \\div 4 = 3$ remainder 2\n- $3 \\div 4 = 0$ remainder 3\n\n## Step 3: Determine the base-4 representation\nThe base-4 representation of $233_{10}$ is $3221_4$, reading the remainders from the last to the first.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the odd digits in base-4\nIn base-4, the odd digits are 1 and 3. We need to count how many of these digits appear in the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$.\n\n## Step 5: Count the odd digits\nLooking at $3221_4$, we find one 3 and one 1. Therefore, there are 2 odd digits in the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

    "## Step 1: Convert the given decimal number to base-4\nTo convert $233_{10}$ to base-4, we need to divide it by 4 and keep track of the remainders. We start by dividing 233 by 4.\n\n## Step 2: Perform the division and find the remainder\n233 divided by 4 gives a quotient of 58 and a remainder of 1. The remainder is part of the base-4 representation.\n\n## Step 3: Continue the division process with the quotient\nNow, we divide the quotient 58 by 4. This gives a new quotient of 14 and a remainder of 2.\n\n## Step 4: Repeat the division process\nNext, we divide the quotient 14 by 4, which gives a new quotient of 3 and a remainder of 2.\n\n## Step 5: Continue the division process again\nThen, we divide the quotient 3 by 4, resulting in a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 3. Since the quotient is now 0, we stop the division process.\n\n## Step 6: Write down the base-4 representation\nThe base-4 representation of $233_{10}$ is $3221_4$, reading the remainders from the last to the first.\n\n## Step 7: Count the number of odd digits in the base-4 representation\nIn base-4, the odd digits are 1 and 3. From the base-4 representation $3221_4$, we count the occurrences of 1 and 3.\n\n## Step 8: Identify and count the odd digits\nThere are 2 odd digits (1 and 3) in the base-4 representation $3221_4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"

  "solution": "We begin by converting $233_{10}$ into base-4. Since $4^3=64$ is the largest power of 4 that is less than 233, and $3\\cdot64=192$ is the largest multiple of 64 that is less than 233, the coefficient of the $4^3$ term will be 3. From here, we are left with a remainder of $233-192=41$. The largest power of 4 that is less than this number is $4^2=16$, and the largest multiple of 16 that is less than 41 is $2\\cdot16=32$. This leaves us with $41-32=9$, which we can express as $2\\cdot4^1+1\\cdot4^0$. So, we find that $233_{10}=3\\cdot4^3+2\\cdot4^2+2\\cdot{4^1}+1\\cdot4^0=3221_4$, which has $\\boxed{2}$ odd digits.",
