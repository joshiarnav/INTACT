    "## Step 1: To solve the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$, we first need to find the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27.\nThe multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27 is an integer $a$ such that $4a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}$. We need to find this $a$.\n\n## Step 2: To find the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or simply check multiples of 4 to see which one leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 27.\nBy inspection or using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that $4 \\times 7 = 28$, which is $1$ more than $27$. Thus, $7$ is the multiplicative inverse of $4$ modulo $27$ because $4 \\times 7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}$.\n\n## Step 3: Now that we have the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27, which is 7, we can multiply both sides of the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$ by 7 to solve for $x$.\nMultiplying both sides by 7 gives $7 \\times 4x \\equiv 7 \\times 13 \\pmod{27}$, which simplifies to $x \\equiv 91 \\pmod{27}$ because $7 \\times 4 = 28 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}$ and $7 \\times 13 = 91$.\n\n## Step 4: We need to find the smallest positive integer that satisfies $x \\equiv 91 \\pmod{27}$.\nTo find the smallest positive integer, we reduce 91 modulo 27. Since $91 = 27 \\times 3 + 10$, we have $x \\equiv 10 \\pmod{27}$. Thus, the smallest positive integer $x$ that satisfies the original congruence is 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",

    "To solve the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$, we need to find the smallest positive integer $x$ that satisfies this equation.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe given congruence is $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$. This means that $4x - 13$ must be divisible by 27.\n\n## Step 2: Finding the Modular Multiplicative Inverse of 4 Modulo 27\nTo solve the congruence, we first need to find the modular multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27. This is an integer $y$ such that $4y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}$. We can find this by inspection or by using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\n\n## Step 3: Applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm\nWe apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients $y$ and $z$ such that $4y + 27z = 1$. However, since 4 and 27 are relatively prime (gcd(4, 27) = 1), we know that such $y$ and $z$ exist.\n\n## Step 4: Calculating the Modular Multiplicative Inverse\nTo simplify the calculation, we can look for a multiple of 4 that is 1 more than a multiple of 27, or use the algorithm directly. However, a quicker approach is to notice that $4 \\times 7 = 28$, which is $1 \\pmod{27}$. Thus, the modular multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27 is 7.\n\n## Step 5: Multiplying Both Sides of the Congruence by the Inverse\nWe multiply both sides of the given congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$ by 7 to isolate $x$. This gives us $x \\equiv 7 \\times 13 \\pmod{27}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculating the Value of $x$\nNow, we calculate $7 \\times 13 = 91$. To find $x$ in the range of $0$ to $26$ (since we're working modulo 27), we reduce 91 modulo 27.\n\n## Step 7: Reducing 91 Modulo 27\nWe divide 91 by 27 to find the remainder. $91 \\div 27 = 3$ remainder $10$. Thus, $91 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{27}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
