    "## Step 1: Determine the range of bases for a 4-digit number\nTo have a 4-digit number in base $b$, the number $555_{10}$ must satisfy the condition $b^3 \\leq 555 < b^4$. This means we are looking for a base where $b^3$ is less than or equal to 555 and $b^4$ is greater than 555.\n\n## Step 2: Find the cube root and fourth root of 555\nTo narrow down the possible bases, we calculate the cube root and fourth root of 555. The cube root of 555 is approximately 8.17, and the fourth root of 555 is approximately 4.74.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the range of bases\nGiven that the cube root of 555 is approximately 8.17 and the fourth root is approximately 4.74, the base $b$ must be greater than 4.74 and less than or equal to 8.17, since $b$ has to be an integer. This gives us a range of possible bases from 5 to 8.\n\n## Step 4: Test each base in the range\nNow, we need to test each possible base (5, 6, 7, 8) to see if $555_{10}$ can be expressed in the form ABAB, where A and B are two different digits.\n\n## Step 5: Convert $555_{10}$ to each possible base\nStarting with base 5:\n- Base 5: $555_{10} = 4200_5$, which does not fit the ABAB pattern.\n- Base 6:\n- To convert $555_{10}$ to base 6, we divide 555 by 6 repeatedly and record the remainders.\n- $555 \\div 6 = 92$ remainder 3\n- $92 \\div 6 = 15$ remainder 2\n- $15 \\div 6 = 2$ remainder 3\n- $2 \\div 6 = 0$ remainder 2\n- So, $555_{10} = 2323_6$, which fits the ABAB pattern.\n\n## Step 6: Verify if base 6 is the correct base\nSince $555_{10}$ expressed in base 6 results in a 4-digit number in the form ABAB (2323), base 6 satisfies the given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

This means we are looking for a base $b$ such that $b^3$ is less than or equal to 555 and $b^4$ is greater than 555.\n\n## Step 2: Find the range of $b$\nWe need to solve the inequality $b^3 \\leq 555 < b^4$. Let's first find the cube root and fourth root of 555 to establish the range of $b$. The cube root of 555 is approximately 8.17, and the fourth root of 555 is approximately 4.74. This suggests that $b$ must be greater than or equal to 5 (since $4^3 = 64$ and $5^3 = 125$) and less than 9 (since $8^3 = 512$ and $9^3 = 729$), but we need to consider the upper limit imposed by $b^4$ as well.\n\n## Step 3: Test potential bases\nGiven that $b$ has to be an integer and that $5^3 = 125$, $6^3 = 216$, $7^3 = 343$, $8^3 = 512$, and $9^3 = 729$, we can see that $b$ could potentially be 6, 7, or 8 since $555$ falls between $6^3$ and $7^3$ but is less than $8^3$. However, we need to check which of these bases results in a number with the form ABAB when $555_{10}$ is converted.\n\n## Step 4: Convert $555_{10}$ to potential bases\nLet's convert $555_{10}$ into bases 6, 7, and 8 to see if any result in the ABAB pattern.\n\n- For base 6: Dividing 555 by 6 gives 92 remainder 3, 92 divided by 6 gives 15 remainder 2, 15 divided by 6 gives 2 remainder 3, and 2 divided by 6 gives 0 remainder 2. Thus, $555_{10}$ in base 6 is $2323_6$, which matches the ABAB pattern.\n\n- For base 7: Dividing 555 by 7 gives 79 remainder 2, 79 divided by 7 gives 11 remainder 2, 11 divided by 7 gives 1 remainder 4, and 1 divided by 7 gives 0 remainder 1. Thus, $555_{10}$ in base 7 is $4221_7$, which does not match the ABAB pattern.\n\n- For base 8: Dividing 555 by 8 gives 69 remainder 3, 69 divided by 8 gives 8 remainder 5, 8 divided by 8 gives 1 remainder 0, and 1 divided by 8 gives 0 remainder 1. Thus, $555_{10}$ in base 8 is $1053_8$, which does not match the ABAB pattern.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the correct base\nFrom step 4, we can see that base 6 is the only base that results in a 4-digit number with the form ABAB when $555_{10}$ is converted.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nThe problem states that when the decimal number $555_{10}$ is expressed in a certain base, it results in a 4-digit number in the form ABAB, where A and B are two different digits.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the range of the base\nFor a base $b$ to result in a 4-digit number when $555_{10}$ is converted, it must satisfy the condition $b^3 \\leq 555 < b^4$. This is because the smallest 4-digit number in base $b$ is $b^3$ (1000 in base $b$) and the largest 4-digit number is $b^4 - 1$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the inequality for the base\nTo find the possible bases, we need to solve the inequality $b^3 \\leq 555 < b^4$. Let's start by finding the cube root and fourth root of 555. $\\sqrt[3]{555} \\approx 8.17$ and $\\sqrt[4]{555} \\approx 4.74$. This means $b$ must be greater than or equal to 5 (since $4^3 = 64$ and $5^3 = 125$) and less than 9 (since $8^3 = 512$ and $9^3 = 729$).\n\n## Step 4: Test possible bases\nGiven that A and B are different digits and the number is in the form ABAB, we can test bases 5, 6, 7, and 8 to see if any of them result in a number that fits this pattern.\n\n## Step 5: Convert $555_{10}$ to base 5\nFirst, let's convert $555_{10}$ to base 5.\n- $555 \\div 5 = 111$ remainder 0\n- $111 \\div 5 = 22$ remainder 1\n- $22 \\div 5 = 4$ remainder 2\n- $4 \\div 5 = 0$ remainder 4\nSo, $555_{10}$ in base 5 is $4210_5$. This does not fit the ABAB pattern.\n\n## Step 6: Convert $555_{10}$ to base 6\nNext, convert $555_{10}$ to base 6.\n- $555 \\div 6 = 92$ remainder 3\n- $92 \\div 6 = 15$ remainder 2\n- $15 \\div 6 = 2$ remainder 3\n- $2 \\div 6 = 0$ remainder 2\nSo, $555_{10}$ in base 6 is $2323_6$. This fits the ABAB pattern.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the base\nSince $555_{10}$ in base 6 results in a number that fits the ABAB pattern with different digits, we have found the base that satisfies the problem's conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"

  "solution": "First, let us find which bases result in $555_{10}$ having four digits. We must find base b such that $b^{4}>555_{10}\\geq b^{3}$. We easily determine that b can range from 5 to 8, inclusive.  We can now try each of these four bases to see which yields a number in the form ABAB.  For base six, we find that $6^{3}=216$, which can go into 555 only two times at most, leaving $555-2\\cdot216 = 123$ for the next three digits. $6^{2}=36$ goes into 123 three times at most, leaving us with $123-3\\cdot36 = 15$. Then, $6^{1}=6$ goes into 15 two times at most, leaving $15-2\\cdot6 = 3$ for the ones digit. So, the base $\\boxed{6}$ equivalent of $555_{10}$ is $2323_{6}$, which satisfies all of the requirements stated.",
