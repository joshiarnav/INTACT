    "## Step 1: Determine the conditions for divisibility\nTo find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we need to start by considering the properties of numbers and their divisibility rules. A number is divisible by its digits if the remainder when the number is divided by each of its digits is zero. We also know that the number must be less than 1000, since it's a three-digit number.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the hundreds digit\nSince we're looking for the largest such number, we should start with the largest possible hundreds digit, which is 9. This is because starting with 9 gives us the highest possible starting point for our three-digit number.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the tens and units digits\nWith 9 as the hundreds digit, we need to find the appropriate tens and units digits. These digits must be distinct, non-zero, and the entire number must be divisible by each of them. Given that the number is divisible by 9 (the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9), and we are looking for the largest possible number, we should consider starting from the highest possible values for the tens and units digits that meet these criteria.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate possible combinations\nStarting with 9 as the hundreds digit, we evaluate possible combinations for the tens and units digits that are distinct, non-zero, and ensure the entire number is divisible by each digit. We need to remember that for a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3, and for it to be divisible by 2, its last digit must be even.\n\n## Step 5: Apply divisibility rules to find the solution\nThe divisibility rule for 9 states that the sum of the digits must be divisible by 9. Considering the largest possible digits, if we start with 9 and want to maximize the value, we could consider digits like 8 and 7 (since 9 + 8 + 7 = 24, which is not divisible by 9, we need to find another combination). Another combination could involve 9, 6, and a smaller digit that makes the sum divisible by 9 and also meets the other divisibility criteria.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the largest valid number\nConsidering the need for the sum of the digits to be divisible by 9 and for the number to be divisible by its distinct, non-zero digits, we examine combinations like 936, where 9 + 3 + 6 = 18, which is divisible by 9. We also need to check divisibility by 3 and 6. Since 936 is divisible by both 3 and 6, and these digits are distinct and non-zero, this could be a potential candidate for the largest such number.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{936}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the conditions for divisibility\nTo find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we first need to consider the conditions for divisibility. The number must be divisible by each of its digits, which means each digit must be a factor of the number.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the possible hundreds digits\nSince we're looking for the largest three-digit integer, we start with the largest possible hundreds digit, which is 9. If 9 is a digit, the number must be divisible by 9, meaning the sum of its digits must also be divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 3: Explore possible tens and units digits for the hundreds digit 9\nConsidering 9 as the hundreds digit, we need to find the largest possible tens and units digits that, together with 9, form a number divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits. The sum of the digits must be divisible by 9. Possible combinations could involve digits like 6 and 3 (since 9 + 6 + 3 = 18, which is divisible by 9), but we must ensure the entire number is divisible by each digit.\n\n## Step 4: Check divisibility by potential digits\nFor a number like 963, we check divisibility by 9, 6, and 3. The number 963 is divisible by 9 (as 963 / 9 = 107), by 3 (as 963 / 3 = 321), but we must verify divisibility by 6 as well. A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3. Since 963 is not even, it's not divisible by 2, thus not divisible by 6.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the next largest hundreds digit\nIf we cannot find a suitable number starting with 9 that meets all criteria, we consider the next largest hundreds digit, which is 8, and repeat the process of finding suitable tens and units digits that make the number divisible by each of its digits.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the divisibility rules for other digits\nFor a number to be divisible by 8, the last three digits must form a number divisible by 8, but since we're dealing with a three-digit number, the entire number itself must be divisible by 8 if 8 is one of its digits. This is a challenging condition, so we may need to consider smaller hundreds digits like 7, 6, 5, or 4, and find combinations where the number is divisible by each distinct, non-zero digit.\n\n## Step 7: Assess specific numbers for divisibility\nLet's consider a practical example with the hundreds digit being smaller than 9, such as 6. A potential number could be 936, but as previously determined, this doesn't work due to divisibility issues with its digits. Another approach is to start from the largest possible number and work downwards, checking each number that meets the initial criteria (divisible by 9, since it's the largest digit we can start with) and then verify divisibility by the other digits.\n\n## Step 8: Identify the largest valid number\nUpon evaluating the conditions and performing checks, we find that 936 is indeed the largest three-digit number that meets the given conditions. It's divisible by 9 (936 / 9 = 104), by 3 (936 / 3 = 312), and by 6 (936 / 6 = 156), fulfilling the requirement that it's divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{936}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the conditions for divisibility\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits. This means the number must be divisible by its hundreds, tens, and units digits, and all these digits must be different and non-zero.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the possible hundreds digits\nSince we're looking for the largest three-digit number, we start with the largest possible hundreds digit, which is 9. If the hundreds digit is 9, the number is divisible by 9, meaning the sum of its digits must also be divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 3: Explore possible tens and units digits for the hundreds digit 9\nFor a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Starting with 9 as the hundreds digit, we need to find tens and units digits that, when added to 9, result in a sum divisible by 9. Possible sums include 18 (9 + 9), 27 (9 + 9 + 9), but since we need distinct digits, we consider combinations like 9 + 8 + 1 = 18 or 9 + 7 + 2 = 18, and so on.\n\n## Step 4: Check divisibility by tens and units digits\nThe tens and units digits must also divide the number without a remainder. Starting with the highest possible digits and ensuring they are distinct and non-zero, we check combinations for divisibility.\n\n## Step 5: Test the combination 9, 8, and 1\nConsidering the combination 9, 8, and 1 (since 9 + 8 + 1 = 18, which is divisible by 9), we form the number 981 and check if it is divisible by 8 and 1. 981 is divisible by 1 (all numbers are) and by 9 (as the sum of digits is 18), but it's not divisible by 8.\n\n## Step 6: Test the combination 9, 7, and 2\nFor the combination 9, 7, and 2 (9 + 7 + 2 = 18), we also need to ensure the formed number is divisible by 7 and 2. The number 972 is divisible by 9 (sum of digits is 18) and by 2 (last digit is even), but we must verify if it's divisible by 7.\n\n## Step 7: Verify divisibility of 972 by 7\n972 divided by 7 equals 139.043 (approx.), which is not a whole number, meaning 972 is not divisible by 7.\n\n## Step 8: Test the combination 9, 6, and 3\nConsidering 9, 6, and 3 (9 + 6 + 3 = 18), the number 963 is divisible by 9. We must check if it's divisible by 6 and 3. For a number to be divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3. Since 963 is not even, it's not divisible by 2, thus not by 6. However, it is divisible by 3.\n\n## Step 9: Explore other combinations\nWe continue exploring other combinations that fulfill the divisibility conditions for 9 and also consider other hundreds digits if necessary.\n\n## Step 10: Consider the combination 9, 5, and 4\nFor 9, 5, and 4, the sum is 18, making the number divisible by 9. Checking divisibility by 5 and 4, the number must end in 0 or 5 to be divisible by 5, and the last two digits must form a number divisible by 4.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate the number 954 for divisibility by 5 and 4\n954 is not divisible by 5 since it does not end in 0 or 5.\n\n## Step 12: Assess the combination 9, 8, and 1 again for a possible arrangement\nRevisiting the combination 9, 8, and 1, and considering the arrangement 918, we check if it's divisible by 8 and 1. 918 is divisible by 9 (as 9 + 1 + 8 = 18) and by 1, but we must verify its divisibility by 8.\n\n## Step 13: Verify divisibility of 918 by 8\nThe last three digits of 918, which are 18, are not divisible by 8, but since we are considering the whole number, we divide 918 by 8, which gives 114.75, indicating 918 is not divisible by 8.\n\n## Step 14: Test the combination 9, 6, and 3 in a different arrangement\nConsidering the arrangement 936, it's divisible by 9 (since 9 + 3 + 6 = 18) and by 3 (as the sum of digits is divisible by 3), but it needs to be verified for divisibility by 6.\n\n## Step 15: Verify divisibility of 936 by 6\n936 is divisible by both 3 (sum of digits is 18) and 2 (last digit is even), making it divisible by 6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{936}$"

  "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",
