    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the divisibility rule for 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11.\n\nGiven the number in the form $AB,CBA$, we can express it as $10000A + 1000B + 100C + 10B + A$. \n\nThe alternating sum of its digits is $A - B + C - B + A = 2A - 2B + C$.\n\nFor the number to be divisible by 11, $2A - 2B + C$ must be divisible by 11.\n\nSince $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct digits, we want to maximize $A$ to get the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$. \n\nThe maximum value for $A$ can be 9 (since it's a 5-digit number and $A$ cannot be 0). \n\nNow, let's try to find suitable values for $B$ and $C$ such that $2A - 2B + C$ is divisible by 11, and $AB,CBA$ is maximized.\n\nGiven $A = 9$, we have $2(9) - 2B + C = 18 - 2B + C$.\n\nWe need $18 - 2B + C$ to be divisible by 11. Possible values for $18 - 2B + C$ that are divisible by 11 include 0, 11, and -11 (since we're dealing with single-digit values for $B$ and $C$, and we cannot get a value greater than 18).\n\nTrying $18 - 2B + C = 11$, we get $-2B + C = -7$. \n\nTo maximize $B$, let's try $B = 6$ (since we want $AB,CBA$ to be as large as possible), which gives us $C = 5$ ($-2(6) + C = -7$ implies $C = 5$).\n\nSo, $A = 9$, $B = 6$, and $C = 5$ give us a possible number: $96569$.\n\nWe should verify if $2A - 2B + C = 2(9) - 2(6) + 5 = 18 - 12 + 5 = 11$ is indeed divisible by 11, which it is.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven is $\\boxed{96569}$.",

A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in the odd positions and the sum of its digits in the even positions is either 0 or a multiple of 11.\n\nGiven the number $AB,CBA$, let's identify the odd and even positions:\n- Odd positions: $A$ (first digit), $C$ (third digit), $B$ (fifth digit)\n- Even positions: $B$ (second digit), $B$ (fourth digit), $A$ (this is not actually in an even position in a 5-digit number, but $A$ is the last digit in our consideration)\n\nThe sum of the digits in the odd positions is $A + C + B$.\nThe sum of the digits in the even positions is $B + B$.\n\nThe difference between these sums is $(A + C + B) - (B + B) = A + C - B$.\n\nFor $AB,CBA$ to be divisible by 11, $A + C - B$ must be 0 or a multiple of 11.\n\nTo maximize $AB,CBA$, we want $A$ to be as large as possible. Since $A$ cannot be 0 (because then $AB,CBA$ would not be a five-digit integer), the largest possible value for $A$ is 9.\n\nNow, let's try to find suitable values for $B$ and $C$ that make $A + C - B$ a multiple of 11, keeping in mind that all digits must be distinct.\n\nIf $A = 9$, we need $9 + C - B$ to be 0 or a multiple of 11. The largest possible value for $B$ that allows $9 + C - B$ to be a multiple of 11 (and considering $B$ and $C$ must be distinct from $A$ and each other) would be a good starting point.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities for $B$ and $C$ with $A = 9$:\n- For $9 + C - B = 0$, we have $C - B = -9$. Given $C$ and $B$ are distinct digits, this equation cannot be satisfied because $C$ and $B$ cannot be negative, and their difference cannot be -9 with both being single-digit numbers.\n- For $9 + C - B = 11$, we have $C - B = 2$. This could work with various combinations, but we need to maximize $AB,CBA$ while ensuring $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct.\n\nConsidering $A = 9$ and aiming for the highest possible $AB,CBA$, let's look at high values for $B$ that could satisfy our conditions with $C - B = 2$.\n\nIf $B = 8$, then $C = 10$, which is not possible since $C$ must be a single digit.\n\nIf $B = 7$, then $C = 9$, which is not possible since $A$ and $C$ cannot be the same.\n\nIf $B = 6$, then $C = 8$, which satisfies our conditions because $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct.\n\nSo, with $A = 9$, $B = 6$, and $C = 8$, we have $9 + 8 - 6 = 11$, which is divisible by 11.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven is $96,869$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{96869}$"

  "solution": "We can test an integer for divisibility by $11$ by alternately adding and subtracting its digits.  For example, $8162$ is divisible by 11 because $8-1+6-2=11$ is divisible by 11.  In this case, $2A-2B+C$ must be divisible by 11.  If there are satisfactory values of $B$ and $C$ corresponding to $A=9$, then the resulting integer would be larger than any integer with $A<9$.  Therefore, we try $A=9$ first.  If $A=9$, then $C-2B+18$ must be divisible by $11$.  Equivalently, $C-2B$ equals $-7$ or $4$, which implies $C=2B-7$ or $C=2B+4$.  Wanting to make $B$ as large as possible, we try $B=9,8,7,\\ldots$. $B$ cannot be $9$ because $A$, $B$, and $C$ must be distinct.  If $B=8$, then $C=9$, so again the digits are not distinct.  If $B=7$, then $C=7$ and still the digits are not distinct.  If $B=6$, then $C=5$, and $AB,\\!CBA=\\boxed{96,\\!569}$.",
