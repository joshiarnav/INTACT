    "## Step 1: First, let's find the prime factorization of $7!$, which is $7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$.\n$7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1$.\n\n## Step 2: To find the total number of divisors, including both even and odd, we use the formula $(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)(d+1)$ where $a, b, c, d$ are the powers of the prime factors in the prime factorization.\nUsing the prime factorization from step 1, the total number of divisors is $(4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 5 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 60$.\n\n## Step 3: Next, let's determine the number of odd divisors. An odd divisor will not include any factor of 2. So, we consider the prime factorization without the factor of $2^4$, which is $3^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1$.\nThe number of odd divisors is found by the formula $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 12$.\n\n## Step 4: To find the number of even divisors, we subtract the number of odd divisors from the total number of divisors.\nNumber of even divisors = Total number of divisors - Number of odd divisors = $60 - 12 = 48$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{48}$",
    "## Step 1: Calculate the prime factorization of 7!\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of 7!, which is 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. This equals 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 7.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the properties of even divisors\nAn even divisor must have at least one 2 in its prime factorization. Since 7! has 2^4 in its prime factorization, any even divisor can have 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, or 2^4 in its factorization.\n\n## Step 3: Count the possible powers of 2 for even divisors\nFor an even divisor, the power of 2 can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. That gives us 4 possibilities.\n\n## Step 4: Count the possible powers of 3 for all divisors\nThe power of 3 in the prime factorization of any divisor of 7! can be 0, 1, or 2, since 7! = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 7. That gives us 3 possibilities.\n\n## Step 5: Count the possible powers of 5 for all divisors\nThe power of 5 can be 0 or 1, since 7! has one 5 in its prime factorization. That gives us 2 possibilities.\n\n## Step 6: Count the possible powers of 7 for all divisors\nThe power of 7 can be 0 or 1, since 7! has one 7 in its prime factorization. That gives us 2 possibilities.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total number of even divisors\nThe total number of even divisors is found by multiplying the possibilities for each prime factor together. So, it's 4 (for 2) * 3 (for 3) * 2 (for 5) * 2 (for 7) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 2 = 48.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{48}$",

The prime factorization of 7! is 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 * 7.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the requirements for even divisors\nAn even divisor must have at least one factor of 2. Since 7! has 2^4 as part of its prime factorization, any divisor that includes 2 raised to any power from 1 to 4 will be even.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of even divisors\nThe total number of divisors for 7! can be found by multiplying together one more than each of the exponents in its prime factorization: (4+1) * (2+1) * (1+1) * (1+1) = 5 * 3 * 2 * 2 = 60. However, to specifically count the even divisors, we must exclude those divisors that do not contain any factor of 2.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of odd divisors\nOdd divisors are those that do not contain any factor of 2. The prime factorization without the 2s is 3^2 * 5 * 7. The number of odd divisors can be calculated by multiplying together one more than each of the exponents in this modified prime factorization: (2+1) * (1+1) * (1+1) = 3 * 2 * 2 = 12.\n\n## Step 5: Find the number of even divisors\nThe total number of divisors is 60, and the number of odd divisors is 12.

  "solution": "By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, we may count the number of even divisors of $7!$ by counting the number of ways to form the prime factorization of an even divisor of $7!$.  Suppose that $7!$ is divisible by an even positive integer $r$.  Since the prime factorization of $7!$ is $7\\cdot(2\\cdot3)\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\cdot2)\\cdot3\\cdot2=2^4\\cdot3^2\\cdot5\\cdot7$, the prime factorization of $r$ does not include any primes other than $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$.  Express $r$ in terms of its prime factorization as $2^a3^b5^c7^d$.  Then $7!/r=2^{4-a}3^{2-b}5^{1-c}7^{1-d}$.  Since $7!/r$ is an integer, $d$ must equal $0$ or $1$, $c$ must equal $0$ or $1$, and $b$ must equal $0$, $1$ or $2$.  Finally, $a$ may be no larger than $4$, but it must be at least $1$ since $r$ is even.  Altogether there are $2\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=48$ total possibilities for the four exponents $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, and hence $\\boxed{48}$ even divisors.",
