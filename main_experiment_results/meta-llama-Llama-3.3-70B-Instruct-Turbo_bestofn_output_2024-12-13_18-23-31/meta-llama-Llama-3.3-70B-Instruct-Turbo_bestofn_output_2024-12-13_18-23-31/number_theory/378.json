    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find all positive integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ results in an integer.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the fraction\nThe fraction $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ can be broken down into $1 + \\frac{18}{n}$, because $\\frac{n}{n} = 1$ and $\\frac{18}{n}$ is the remainder.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the condition for the fraction to be an integer\nFor $1 + \\frac{18}{n}$ to be an integer, $\\frac{18}{n}$ must be an integer because $1$ is already an integer.\n\n## Step 4: Find all positive integer divisors of 18\nThe divisors of 18 are the numbers that divide 18 without leaving a remainder. These include 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\n## Step 5: Sum all the divisors found in step 4\nTo find the sum, we add all the divisors together: $1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 18 = 39$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{39}$",

For this to be an integer, $\\frac{18}{n}$ must be an integer because $1$ is already an integer.\n\n## Step 3: Identify possible values of $n$\nSince $\\frac{18}{n}$ needs to be an integer, $n$ must be a factor of $18$.

    "## Step 1: Understand the condition for $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ to be an integer\nFor $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ to be an integer, $n$ must divide $n+18$ without leaving a remainder. This implies that $n$ must also divide the difference between $n+18$ and $n$, which is $18$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the divisors of 18\nTo find all positive integer values of $n$ that satisfy the condition, we need to find all the divisors of $18$. The divisors of $18$ are $1, 2, 3, 6, 9,$ and $18$.\n\n## Step 3: Verify that each divisor satisfies the condition\nEach of these divisors makes $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ an integer because they divide $18$ without a remainder, which in turn means they divide $n+18$ without a remainder when $n$ is one of these divisors.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of the divisors\nThe sum of these divisors is $1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 18 = 39$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{39}$"
