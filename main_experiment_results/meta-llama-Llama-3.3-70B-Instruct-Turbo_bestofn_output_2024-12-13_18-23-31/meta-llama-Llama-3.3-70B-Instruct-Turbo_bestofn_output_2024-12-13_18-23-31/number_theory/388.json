    "## Step 1: Identify the problem and the goal\nThe problem asks for the sum of the tens digit and the units digit in the decimal representation of $9^{2004}$. To solve this, we need to find the last two digits of $9^{2004}$.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the pattern of the last two digits of powers of 9\nTo find the pattern, let's calculate the last two digits of the first few powers of 9:\n- $9^1 = 09$\n- $9^2 = 81$\n- $9^3 = 29$\n- $9^4 = 61$\n- $9^5 = 49$\n- $9^6 = 41$\n- $9^7 = 69$\n- $9^8 = 21$\n- $9^9 = 89$\n- $9^{10} = 01$\nWe notice that the sequence of the last two digits repeats every 10 powers of 9.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the relevant power of 9 for $9^{2004}$\nSince the pattern repeats every 10 powers, we need to find the remainder when 2004 is divided by 10. $2004 \\mod 10 = 4$. This means the last two digits of $9^{2004}$ are the same as the last two digits of $9^4$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the last two digits of $9^4$\nFrom the pattern observed in step 2, $9^4$ ends in 61.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the sum of the tens digit and the units digit\nThe tens digit is 6 and the units digit is 1. Therefore, the sum of the tens digit and the units digit is $6 + 1 = 7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",

    "## Step 1: Identify the pattern of the last two digits of powers of 9\nWe start by calculating the last two digits of the first few powers of 9 to identify any repeating pattern. For 9^1, the last two digits are 09. For 9^2, the last two digits are 81. For 9^3, the last two digits are 29. For 9^4, the last two digits are 61. For 9^5, the last two digits are 49. For 9^6, the last two digits are 41. For 9^7, the last two digits are 69. For 9^8, the last two digits are 21. For 9^9, the last two digits are 89. For 9^10, the last two digits are 01. We notice that a pattern emerges where the sequence of the last two digits repeats every 10 powers of 9 (09, 81, 29, 61, 49, 41, 69, 21, 89, 01).\n\n## Step 2: Determine the remainder when the exponent is divided by 10\nTo find the last two digits of 9^2004, we need to find the remainder when 2004 is divided by 10 since the pattern repeats every 10 powers. 2004 divided by 10 equals 200 with a remainder of 4.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the last two digits of 9^2004 based on the pattern and remainder\nGiven that the remainder is 4, we look at the pattern established in step 1. The fourth power of 9 in the pattern has the last two digits as 61.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of the tens digit and the units digit\nThe tens digit of 61 is 6 and the units digit is 1. Therefore, the sum of the tens digit and the units digit is 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"

  "solution": "Write $9$ as $10-1$ and consider raising 9 to the 2004 power by multiplying out the expression \\[\n\\overbrace{(10-1)(10-1)(10-1)\\cdots(10-1)}^{2004\\text{ factors}}\n\\] There will be $2^{2004}$ terms in this expansion (one for each way to choose either 10 or $-1$ for each of the 2004 factors of $(10-1)$), but most of them will not affect the tens or units digit because they will have two or more factors of 10 and therefore will be divisible by 100.  Only the 2004 terms of $-10$ which come from choosing $-1$ in 2003 of the factors and 10 in the remaining one as well as the term $(-1)^{2004}=1$ remain.  Let $N$ represent the sum of all of the terms with more than 1 factor of 10.  We have \\begin{align*}\n(10-1)^{2004}&=N+2004(-10)+1\\\\\n&= N-20,\\!040+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-40+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-39.\n\\end{align*} So $9^{2004}$ is 39 less than a multiple of 100 and therefore ends in 61.  The sum of 6 and 1 is $\\boxed{7}$.",
