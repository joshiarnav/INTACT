    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to convert the decimal number $84_{10}$ to its binary representation in base $2$.\n\n## Step 2: Divide the number by 2\nTo start converting $84_{10}$ to binary, we divide it by $2$ and note the remainder. $84 \\div 2 = 42$ with a remainder of $0$.\n\n## Step 3: Continue dividing the quotient by 2\nNext, we divide the quotient $42$ by $2$. $42 \\div 2 = 21$ with a remainder of $0$.\n\n## Step 4: Repeat the division process\nWe continue by dividing $21$ by $2$. $21 \\div 2 = 10$ with a remainder of $1$.\n\n## Step 5: Continue the division process further\nNow, divide $10$ by $2$. $10 \\div 2 = 5$ with a remainder of $0$.\n\n## Step 6: Keep dividing\nDivide $5$ by $2$. $5 \\div 2 = 2$ with a remainder of $1$.\n\n## Step 7: Next division step\nDivide $2$ by $2$. $2 \\div 2 = 1$ with a remainder of $0$.\n\n## Step 8: Final division step\nLastly, divide $1$ by $2$. $1 \\div 2 = 0$ with a remainder of $1$.\n\n## Step 9: Construct the binary representation\nNow, we construct the binary representation by reading the remainders from the last step to the first: $1010100_2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10101002}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the largest power of 2 that fits into 84\nTo find the base 2 representation of 84, we start by determining the largest power of 2 that fits into 84. This will help us find the leftmost digit in the binary representation.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the largest power of 2\nThe largest power of 2 that fits into 84 is $2^6 = 64$. This means the leftmost digit in our binary representation is 1, and we subtract 64 from 84 to continue breaking down the number.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the next digit\nAfter subtracting 64 from 84, we have 20 left. We now need to find the largest power of 2 that fits into 20. This will help us determine the next digit in the binary representation.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the next power of 2\nThe largest power of 2 that fits into 20 is $2^4 = 16$. This means the next digit in our binary representation is 1, and we subtract 16 from 20 to continue.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the next digit\nAfter subtracting 16 from 20, we have 4 left. We need to find the largest power of 2 that fits into 4 to determine the next digit in the binary representation.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the next power of 2\nThe largest power of 2 that fits into 4 is $2^2 = 4$. This means the next digit in our binary representation is 1, and we subtract 4 from 4, leaving us with 0.\n\n## Step 7: Fill in the remaining digits\nSince we've accounted for all the value with $2^6$, $2^4$, and $2^2$, the remaining digits (for $2^5$, $2^3$, and $2^1$, and $2^0$) are 0.\n\n## Step 8: Write the binary representation\nCombining all the digits from the steps above, we get the binary representation of 84 as 1010100.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1010100}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the largest power of 2 that fits into 84\nTo find the base 2 representation of 84, we start by determining the largest power of 2 that fits into 84. Since 2^6 = 64 is the largest power of 2 less than 84, we'll use this as our starting point.\n\n## Step 2: Subtract the largest power of 2 from 84 and note the remainder\nSubtract 2^6 (64) from 84, which gives us 84 - 64 = 20. We note that the remainder is 20, and we also note that the coefficient for 2^6 in the binary representation is 1.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the largest power of 2 that fits into the remainder 20\nNow, we look for the largest power of 2 that fits into 20. Since 2^4 = 16 is the largest power of 2 less than 20, we use this as our next step.\n\n## Step 4: Subtract the largest power of 2 from 20 and note the new remainder\nSubtract 2^4 (16) from 20, which gives us 20 - 16 = 4. We note that the remainder is now 4, and we also note that the coefficient for 2^4 in the binary representation is 1.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the largest power of 2 that fits into the remainder 4\nNext, we find the largest power of 2 that fits into 4. Since 2^2 = 4 is equal to our remainder, we use this.\n\n## Step 6: Subtract the largest power of 2 from 4 and note the final remainder\nSubtract 2^2 (4) from 4, which gives us 4 - 4 = 0. The remainder is now 0, and we note that the coefficient for 2^2 in the binary representation is 1.\n\n## Step 7: Compile the binary representation\nWe've determined the coefficients for 2^6, 2^4, and 2^2 are all 1. Since we didn't use 2^5, 2^3, or 2^1, their coefficients are 0. Thus, the binary representation of 84 is 1010100.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10101002}$"

  "solution": "We first find that the largest power of $2$ that is less than $84$ is $2^6 = 64$. Our next step is to find the largest power of $2$ that is less than $84 - 64 = 20$ which is $2^4=16$. This leaves us left with $20 - 16 = 4$, but $4 = 2 ^2$, so we have $$84 = 1 \\cdot 2^6 + 0 \\cdot 2^5 + 1 \\cdot 2^4 + 0 \\cdot 2^3 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 0 \\cdot 2^0.$$Thus, our base $2$ representation of $84_{10}$ is $\\boxed{1010100_2}$.",
