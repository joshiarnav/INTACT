    "## Step 1: Recall the relationship between gcd and lcm\nThe relationship between the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers k and \u2113 is given by the formula: $\\gcd(k,\\ell) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = k\\ell$.\n\n## Step 2: Express lcm in terms of gcd\nFrom the formula in step 1, we can express $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$ as $\\frac{k\\ell}{\\gcd(k,\\ell)}$. Given that $\\gcd(k,\\ell) = 3$, we have $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = \\frac{k\\ell}{3}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the conditions for k and \u2113\nSince $k$ and $\\ell$ are positive 4-digit integers and $\\gcd(k,\\ell) = 3$, both $k$ and $\\ell$ must be multiples of 3 but cannot both be multiples of any higher power of 3 or any other prime number (to maintain the gcd of 3).\n\n## Step 4: Find the smallest possible values for k and \u2113\nThe smallest 4-digit multiple of 3 is 1002. However, to minimize the lcm, we should choose one number to be the smallest possible (1002) and the other to be the next smallest that maintains the gcd of 3 but is not a multiple of any higher power of 3 or other common factors. The next multiple of 3 that is a 4-digit number and satisfies the condition is 1005, as it is also not a multiple of any higher power of 3 and does not share additional factors with 1002.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the smallest possible lcm\nSubstituting $k = 1002$ and $\\ell = 1005$ into the formula $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = \\frac{k\\ell}{3}$ gives $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[1002,1005] = \\frac{1002 \\times 1005}{3}$.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the multiplication and division\n$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[1002,1005] = \\frac{1002 \\times 1005}{3} = \\frac{1007010}{3} = 335670$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{335670}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand what the greatest common divisor (gcd) and least common multiple (lcm) mean.\nThe greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. The least common multiple (lcm) of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the relationship between gcd and lcm.\nFor any two positive integers $a$ and $b$, the relationship between their gcd and lcm is given by $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$. This implies that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = \\frac{ab}{\\gcd(a,b)}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the implications of $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$.\nSince $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$, both $k$ and $\\ell$ must be multiples of 3 but share no other prime factors (otherwise, their gcd would be greater than 3). Given that $k$ and $\\ell$ are 4-digit integers, the smallest possible values for $k$ and $\\ell$ that satisfy this condition need to be determined.\n\n## Step 4: Find the smallest 4-digit multiples of 3.\nThe smallest 4-digit multiple of 3 is 1002 (since 1000 is not divisible by 3, and 1002 is the first number after 1000 that is divisible by 3). However, to minimize the lcm, we should also consider the next multiple of 3 that does not share any additional factors with 1002, meaning it should not be a multiple of any other prime factor present in 1002 aside from 3.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the prime factorization of 1002.\n1002 factors into $2 \\times 3 \\times 167$. Thus, the next smallest multiple of 3 that does not share these factors (aside from 3) would ideally be a prime multiple of 3 or have a minimal set of prime factors that do not overlap with those of 1002.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the smallest suitable $\\ell$.\nGiven that we want to minimize the lcm and that $\\ell$ should be a 4-digit integer, the next smallest multiple of 3 after 1002 that does not share additional prime factors with 1002 (other than the necessary factor of 3) would be 1005. However, 1005 factors into $3 \\times 5 \\times 67$, which indeed shares only the factor of 3 with 1002, making it a suitable candidate for $\\ell$ to minimize the lcm.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the lcm using $k=1002$ and $\\ell=1005$.\nUsing the formula $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = \\frac{k\\ell}{\\gcd(k,\\ell)}$, and given $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$, we can substitute $k=1002$ and $\\ell=1005$ into the formula to find the smallest possible value for the lcm.\n\n## Step 8: Perform the calculation.\n$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[1002,1005] = \\frac{1002 \\times 1005}{3} = \\frac{1007010}{3} = 335670$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{335670}$",

Given that $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$, this means that both $k$ and $\\ell$ are divisible by 3.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the relationship between gcd, lcm, and the product of two numbers.\nFor any two numbers $k$ and $\\ell$, the product of $k$ and $\\ell$ is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm.

This means the smallest possible values for $k$ and $\\ell$ that meet these criteria and are multiples of 3 are 1002 (the smallest 4-digit multiple of 3) and 1005 (the next smallest 4-digit multiple of 3 that is not a multiple of any other common factor with 1002 besides 3).\n\n## Step 5: Find the smallest possible lcm using the smallest values for k and ell that fit the criteria.\nSubstituting $k = 1002$ and $\\ell = 1005$ into the equation $\\text{lcm}[k,\\ell] = \\frac{k\\ell}{3}$ gives $\\text{lcm}[1002,1005] = \\frac{1002 \\times 1005}{3}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the smallest possible lcm.\nPerform the multiplication first: $1002 \\times 1005 = 1,007,010$. Then divide by 3 to find the lcm: $\\frac{1,007,010}{3} = 335,670$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{335670}$"
