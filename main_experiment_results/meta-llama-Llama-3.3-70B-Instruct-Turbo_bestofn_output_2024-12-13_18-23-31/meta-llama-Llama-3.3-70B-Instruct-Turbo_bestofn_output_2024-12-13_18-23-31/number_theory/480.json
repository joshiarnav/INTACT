    "## Step 1: Define the conditions under which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.\n$n$ does not divide $g(n)$ if $n$ is prime, since a prime number has no proper divisors other than 1, making $g(n) = 1$. Additionally, $n$ does not divide $g(n)$ if $n$ is the square of a prime, because the proper divisors of the square of a prime $p$ are 1 and $p$, making $g(n) = p$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify prime numbers from 2 to 50.\nThe prime numbers between 2 and 50 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47.\n\n## Step 3: Count the number of prime numbers identified in Step 2.\nThere are 15 prime numbers between 2 and 50.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the squares of prime numbers from 2 to 50.\nThe squares of prime numbers between 2 and 50 are: 4 (square of 2), 9 (square of 3), 25 (square of 5), and 49 (square of 7).\n\n## Step 5: Count the number of squares of prime numbers identified in Step 4.\nThere are 4 squares of prime numbers between 2 and 50.\n\n## Step 6: Determine if there are any other numbers for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.\nFor any other composite number that is not the square of a prime, $n$ will divide $g(n)$ because $g(n)$ will include the product of at least two proper divisors that multiply to $n$. Therefore, no additional numbers need to be considered beyond primes and squares of primes.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total number of values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$ by adding the counts from Step 3 and Step 5.\nThe total number of values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$ is the sum of the number of prime numbers and the number of squares of prime numbers: 15 (primes) + 4 (squares of primes) = 19.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$",
    "## Step 1: Understanding the definition of $g(n)$\nThe function $g(n)$ is defined as the product of the proper positive integer divisors of $n$. A proper divisor of $n$ is any divisor of $n$ excluding $n$ itself.\n\n## Step 2: Identifying cases where $n$ does not divide $g(n)$\nFor $n$ to not divide $g(n)$, $n$ must have a specific property regarding its divisors. We need to consider the types of numbers and their divisor patterns to identify such cases.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing prime numbers\nIf $n$ is a prime number, its only proper divisors are $1$. Thus, $g(n) = 1$ for prime numbers, meaning $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$ since $g(n)$ is $1$.\n\n## Step 4: Considering perfect squares of prime numbers\nFor numbers that are perfect squares of prime numbers ($n = p^2$, where $p$ is a prime), the proper divisors are $1$ and $p$. Hence, $g(n) = 1 \\times p = p$. Since $n = p^2$, $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$ because $g(n)$ is $p$, not $p^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Examining composite numbers\nFor composite numbers that are not perfect squares of primes, they typically have more than two proper divisors, including the case where $n$ can be factored into two distinct primes or more. In many cases, the product of these divisors will include $n$ itself, meaning $n$ will divide $g(n)$.\n\n## Step 6: Identifying numbers where $n$ does not divide $g(n)$\nBased on the analysis, we need to count the prime numbers and the perfect squares of prime numbers within the range $2 \\le n \\le 50$, as these are the cases where $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.\n\n## Step 7: Counting prime numbers from 2 to 50\nThe prime numbers between 2 and 50 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47. There are 15 prime numbers.\n\n## Step 8: Counting perfect squares of prime numbers from 2 to 50\nThe perfect squares of prime numbers between 2 and 50 are: $2^2 = 4$, $3^2 = 9$, $5^2 = 25$, $7^2 = 49$. There are 4 such numbers.\n\n## Step 9: Calculating the total number of values of $n$ where $n$ does not divide $g(n)$\nTo find the total number of values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$, we add the number of prime numbers to the number of perfect squares of prime numbers.\n\n## Step 10: Adding the counts from step 7 and step 8\nTotal count = number of prime numbers + number of perfect squares of prime numbers = 15 + 4 = 19.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$",

A proper divisor of $n$ is any divisor of $n$ excluding $n$ itself.\n\n## Step 2: Identify cases where n does not divide g(n)\nFor $n$ to not divide $g(n)$, $n$ must have a specific property that makes its product of proper divisors not divisible by $n$. This typically occurs when $n$ is a prime number, since a prime number's only proper divisors are $1$, making $g(n) = 1$. Thus, $n$ cannot divide $1$ if $n > 1$. Another case is when $n$ is the square of a prime number, because the only proper divisors are $1$ and the prime number itself, so $g(n) = \\text{prime number}$, which cannot be divided by $n$.\n\n## Step 3: Count prime numbers from 2 to 50\nFirst, we identify the prime numbers between $2$ and $50$. These are $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47$.

The squares of prime numbers less than or equal to $\\sqrt{50}$ are $4 (2^2), 9 (3^2), 25 (5^2), 49 (7^2)$. There are $4$ such numbers.\n\n## Step 5: Consider other types of numbers\nFor any other type of number (composite numbers that are not the square of a prime), $n$ will divide $g(n)$ because these numbers have at least two proper divisors that multiply together to give $n$ or a multiple of $n$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total count of n that does not divide g(n)\nThe total count of $n$ values where $n$ does not divide $g(n)$ is the sum of the counts of prime numbers and the squares of prime numbers. So, $15 + 4 = 19$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$"

  "solution": "If $n$ is prime, then $g(n) = 1$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. The primes less than or equal to $50$ are $$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.$$There are $15$ of these primes. Also, if $n$ is the square of a prime, then $g(n) = \\sqrt{n}$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. By looking at the list of primes we already generated, we see that there are four perfect squares of primes less than $50$. If $n$ is any other composite integer, then it can be decomposed into the product of integers $a$ and $b$ with both integers greater than $1$. We have that $ab$ divides $g(n)$ (since $g(n)$ is the product of a collection of integers including $a$ and $b$). Since $ab=n$, this implies that $n$ divides $g(n)$. As a result, there are $15 + 4 = \\boxed{19}$ values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.",
