    "## Step 1: Understand the given congruences\nWe are given two congruences: $4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$ and $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$. These can be simplified to find a value for $x$ that satisfies both equations.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the first congruence\nFor the first congruence $4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$, we can simplify it by dividing both sides by 4, which is a common factor of 4 and 20. This yields $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$, because when we divide the modulus 20 by the greatest common factor of 4 and 20 (which is 4), we get 5.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the second congruence\nFor the second congruence $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$, we need to find an $x$ that satisfies this equation. To simplify, notice that $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$ can be rewritten as $3x\\equiv -4\\pmod{20}$, because $16\\equiv -4\\pmod{20}$. Multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 3 modulo 20, which is 7 (since $3*7\\equiv 1\\pmod{20}$), we get $x\\equiv -28\\pmod{20}$. Simplifying further, $-28\\equiv -8\\pmod{20}$, or $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$, because $-8\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$.\n\n## Step 4: Find a common solution for $x$\nFrom step 2, $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$ implies $x$ could be 2, 7, 12, 17, etc. From step 3, we found $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$. Thus, $x=12$ is a common solution that satisfies both congruences.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $x^2$ and its remainder when divided by 20\nGiven $x=12$, we calculate $x^2 = 12^2 = 144$. To find the remainder when 144 is divided by 20, we perform the division: $144 \\div 20 = 7$ with a remainder of 4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
    "## Step 1: Understanding the first congruence\nFirst, we observe the given congruence $4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$. This means that $4x$ divided by $20$ leaves a remainder of $8$. We can simplify this congruence by dividing both sides by $4$, but we must also divide the modulus $20$ by the greatest common divisor of $20$ and $4$, which is $4$. Thus, we get $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$.\n\n## Step 2: Understanding the second congruence\nNext, we look at the second given congruence $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$. This implies that $3x$ divided by $20$ leaves a remainder of $16$. To simplify, we can try to find an $x$ that satisfies both congruences.\n\n## Step 3: Finding a common solution for both congruences\nSince we have $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$ from the first congruence, we can test values of $x$ that satisfy this condition in the second congruence. Substituting $x=2$ into $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$ gives $6\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$, which is not true. We need to find another value of $x$ that satisfies both conditions.\n\n## Step 4: Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem or inspection to find x\nGiven that $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$, possible values for $x$ include $2, 7, 12, 17$, etc. We can substitute these values into the second congruence to find a match. For $x=12$, $3x=36$, and $36\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$ because $36-16=20$. Thus, $x=12$ is a solution to both congruences.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$\nNow that we know $x=12$, we can find $x^2$ and then find the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$. $x^2 = 12^2 = 144$.\n\n## Step 6: Finding the remainder of $x^2$ divided by $20$\nTo find the remainder of $144$ divided by $20$, we perform the division: $144 \\div 20 = 7$ with a remainder of $4$. Thus, the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$ is $4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and what is required\nWe are! given two congruence equations: $4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$ and $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$. We need to find the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the first congruence equation\nFirst, let's solve $4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$. To do this, we need to find an $x$ such that $4x - 8$ is divisible by $20$. This can be simplified to $4x \\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$, which further simplifies to $2x \\equiv 4\\pmod{10}$ by dividing everything by $2$. This means $x \\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the second congruence equation\nNext, let's solve $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$. This means $3x - 16$ is divisible by $20$. We can simplify this to $3x \\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$. Finding a multiplicative inverse of $3$ modulo $20$ or by inspection, we find $x \\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$ as one solution since $3*12 = 36$ which is $16$ more than a multiple of $20$.\n\n## Step 4: Find a common solution for both equations\nFrom step 2, $x \\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$, which implies $x$ could be $2, 7, 12, 17, ...$. From step 3, we have $x \\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$. Thus, $x = 12$ is a common solution that satisfies both equations.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$\nNow that we know $x = 12$, we can calculate $x^2 = 12^2 = 144$. To find the remainder when $144$ is divided by $20$, we perform the division: $144 \\div 20 = 7$ with a remainder of $4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
