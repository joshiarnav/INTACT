    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given two numbers, $a$ and $b$, and their respective remainders when divided by 45 and 30. We need to find the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15.\n\n## Step 2: Write equations for a and b\nWhen $a$ is divided by 45, the remainder is 37. This can be written as $a = 45q_1 + 37$, where $q_1$ is the quotient.\nWhen $b$ is divided by 30, the remainder is 9. This can be written as $b = 30q_2 + 9$, where $q_2$ is the quotient.\n\n## Step 3: Add the equations for a and b\nWe add the equations for $a$ and $b$ to get $a+b = 45q_1 + 37 + 30q_2 + 9$.\nSimplifying, we get $a+b = 45q_1 + 30q_2 + 46$.\n\n## Step 4: Factor out 15 from the first two terms\nWe can factor out 15 from the first two terms: $a+b = 15(3q_1 + 2q_2) + 46$.\n\n## Step 5: Rewrite 46 in terms of 15\nWe can rewrite 46 as $45 + 1$, which is $15 \\times 3 + 1$.\nSo, $a+b = 15(3q_1 + 2q_2) + 15 \\times 3 + 1$.\nSimplifying, we get $a+b = 15(3q_1 + 2q_2 + 3) + 1$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the remainder\nWhen $a+b$ is divided by 15, the remainder is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
