    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find all possible quantities of cupcakes Claire could have if she has fewer than 60 cupcakes and when divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 3, and when divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 4.\n\n## Step 2: Set up the equations based on the given conditions\nLet's denote the total number of cupcakes as N. According to the problem, N divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 3, and N divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 4. This can be represented as:\nN = 5a + 3\nN = 7b + 4\nwhere a and b are integers.\n\n## Step 3: Find the possible values of N using the first condition\nFrom the first equation (N = 5a + 3), the possible values of N that are less than 60 and satisfy the condition are:\n3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38, 43, 48, 53, 58.\n\n## Step 4: Find the possible values of N using the second condition\nFrom the second equation (N = 7b + 4), the possible values of N that are less than 60 and satisfy the condition are:\n4, 11, 18, 25, 32, 39, 46, 53.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the common values that satisfy both conditions\nThe values that appear in both lists from step 3 and step 4 are the possible quantities of cupcakes Claire could have:\n18, 53.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the sum of all possible quantities\nTo find the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes, we add the common values together:\n18 + 53 = 71.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{71}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given conditions\nClaire has cupcakes that when divided by 5 leave a remainder of 3, and when divided by 7 leave a remainder of 4.\n\n## Step 2: Establish the equations based on the conditions\nLet's denote the total number of cupcakes as \\(N\\). According to the problem, we have two conditions:\n1. \\(N \\equiv 3 \\mod 5\\)\n2. \\(N \\equiv 4 \\mod 7\\)\n\n## Step 3: Solve the first congruence\nFor \\(N \\equiv 3 \\mod 5\\), this means \\(N = 5k + 3\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the second congruence\nFor \\(N \\equiv 4 \\mod 7\\), this means \\(N = 7m + 4\\), where \\(m\\) is an integer.\n\n## Step 5: Find a common solution for both congruences\nTo find a number that satisfies both conditions, we can list possible values for \\(N\\) from both equations and find the common values. Alternatively, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) since 5 and 7 are coprime.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem\nGiven \\(N = 5k + 3\\) and \\(N = 7m + 4\\), we need to find \\(N\\) that satisfies both. The CRT states that there is a unique solution modulo \\(5 \\times 7 = 35\\).\n\n## Step 7: Find the smallest common solution\nWe can start by substituting \\(N\\) from the first equation into the second: \\(5k + 3 \\equiv 4 \\mod 7\\). Simplifying, \\(5k \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\). Multiplying both sides by 3 (since \\(3 \\times 5 = 15 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\)), we get \\(k \\equiv 3 \\mod 7\\), or \\(k = 7n + 3\\), where \\(n\\) is an integer.\n\n## Step 8: Substitute \\(k\\) back into the equation for \\(N\\)\nSubstituting \\(k = 7n + 3\\) into \\(N = 5k + 3\\), we get \\(N = 5(7n + 3) + 3 = 35n + 15 + 3 = 35n + 18\\).\n\n## Step 9: Determine the possible quantities of cupcakes\nGiven \\(N = 35n + 18\\) and knowing Claire has fewer than 60 cupcakes, we can find all possible values of \\(N\\) by trying different values of \\(n\\).\n\n## Step 10: Calculate possible values for \\(N\\)\nFor \\(n = 0\\), \\(N = 35 \\times 0 + 18 = 18\\).\nFor \\(n = 1\\), \\(N = 35 \\times 1 + 18 = 53\\).\nSince \\(n = 2\\) would give \\(N = 35 \\times 2 + 18 = 88\\), which is greater than 60, we stop here.\n\n## Step 11: Sum all possible quantities\nThe sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes is \\(18 + 53 = 71\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{71}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the conditions given\nClaire has cupcakes that when divided by 5 leave a remainder of 3, and when divided by 7 leave a remainder of 4. This can be represented as two equations: $x \\equiv 3 \\mod 5$ and $x \\equiv 4 \\mod 7$, where $x$ is the total number of cupcakes.\n\n## Step 2: Express the conditions in terms of linear equations\nFrom $x \\equiv 3 \\mod 5$, we can say $x = 5n + 3$ for some integer $n$. From $x \\equiv 4 \\mod 7$, we can say $x = 7m + 4$ for some integer $m$.\n\n## Step 3: Find a general solution that satisfies both conditions\nTo find a number that satisfies both conditions, we can list possible values for $x$ from both equations and find the common numbers. Alternatively, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) since 5 and 7 are coprime. However, given the small range of possible values (fewer than 60 cupcakes), listing and comparing is feasible.\n\n## Step 4: List possible values for x from both conditions\nFor $x = 5n + 3$, possible values include 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38, 43, 48, 53, 58, etc.\nFor $x = 7m + 4$, possible values include 4, 11, 18, 25, 32, 39, 46, 53, etc.\n\n## Step 5: Identify common values that satisfy both conditions\nFrom the lists, the numbers that appear in both sequences are 18 and 53.

  "solution": "If Claire has $N$ cupcakes, we know that $N = 5x+3$ and $N = 7y+4$ for some integers $x$ and $y$. Equating these two forms of $N$, we have $7y+1=5x$. We also know that $N<60$. We can write out all the sufficiently small possible values of $7y+1$: $$1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57.$$Of these, the numbers that are also of the form $5x$ are $15$ and $50$. These correspond to solutions $N=18,$ $N=53$. Thus, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes is $53+18 = \\boxed{71}$.",
