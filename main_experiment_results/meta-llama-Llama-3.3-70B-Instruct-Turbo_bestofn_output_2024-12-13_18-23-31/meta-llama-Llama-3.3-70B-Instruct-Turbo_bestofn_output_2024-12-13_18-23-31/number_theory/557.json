    "## Step 1: Determine the pattern of units digits for powers of 5\nWhen raising 5 to various powers, we observe a pattern in the units digits. For example, $5^1 = 5$, $5^2 = 25$, $5^3 = 125$, and $5^4 = 625$. We notice that the units digit of any power of 5 is always 5.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the pattern to find the units digit of $5^4$\nGiven the pattern observed in step 1, we can directly conclude that the units digit of $5^4$ will also be 5, as the units digit of any power of 5 is consistently 5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

We can see that the units digit of any power of 5 is always 5.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the pattern to find the units digit of $5^4$\nGiven the pattern observed in step 1, we can directly determine the units digit of $5^4$ without calculating the full value.

    "## Step 1: Understand the pattern of units digits for powers of 5\nWhen raising 5 to different powers, the units digit follows a pattern. For $5^1$, the units digit is 5, for $5^2$, it's 25, so the units digit is 5, and this pattern continues for all powers of 5 because no matter how many times you multiply 5 by itself, the last digit will always be 5.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the pattern to $5^4$\nGiven the pattern, we don't actually need to calculate $5^4$ fully to find the units digit. Since any power of 5 ends in 5, $5^4$ will also end in 5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
