    "## Step 1: Express the three positive integers in terms of 24 with their respective remainders.\nLet the three integers be $a$, $b$, and $c$, where $a = 24p + 10$, $b = 24q + 4$, and $c = 24r + 12$. Here, $p$, $q$, and $r$ are integers representing the quotients when $a$, $b$, and $c$ are divided by 24, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Sum the three integers to find their total.\nThe sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $S = a + b + c = (24p + 10) + (24q + 4) + (24r + 12)$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression for the sum of the three integers.\nCombining like terms, $S = 24p + 24q + 24r + 10 + 4 + 12 = 24(p + q + r) + 26$.\n\n## Step 4: Express the sum in a form that shows its remainder when divided by 24.\nSince $24(p + q + r)$ is divisible by 24, we can focus on the remainder of the constant term, 26, when divided by 24. The remainder of 26 divided by 24 is 2.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24.\nTherefore, when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24, the remainder is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information\nWe are given three positive integers that, when divided by 24, leave remainders of 10, 4, and 12, respectively. We can represent these integers as $24a + 10$, $24b + 4$, and $24c + 12$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are non-negative integers.\n\n## Step 2: Sum the three integers\nTo find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24, we first need to sum the integers. The sum is $(24a + 10) + (24b + 4) + (24c + 12)$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the sum\nSimplifying the sum gives us $24a + 24b + 24c + 10 + 4 + 12$, which further simplifies to $24(a + b + c) + 26$.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the remainder when dividing by 24\nWhen dividing $24(a + b + c)$ by 24, the remainder is 0 because $24(a + b + c)$ is perfectly divisible by 24. So, we only need to consider the remainder when 26 is divided by 24.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the remainder of 26 divided by 24\nDividing 26 by 24 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

We need to find the remainder when the sum of these three integers is divided by 24.\n\n## Step 2: Representing the integers\nLet's represent the three integers based on the given remainders. We can express them as $24a + 10$, $24b + 4$, and $24c + 12$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are non-negative integers.\n\n## Step 3: Finding the sum of the integers\nThe sum of the three integers can be expressed as $(24a + 10) + (24b + 4) + (24c + 12)$. Simplifying this, we get $24a + 24b + 24c + 26$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplifying the sum\nFactoring out the common factor of 24 from the first three terms, we have $24(a + b + c) + 26$. Since $24(a + b + c)$ is divisible by 24, it will leave no remainder when divided by 24.\n\n## Step 5: Finding the remainder of the sum\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 26 is divided by 24. 26 divided by 24 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
