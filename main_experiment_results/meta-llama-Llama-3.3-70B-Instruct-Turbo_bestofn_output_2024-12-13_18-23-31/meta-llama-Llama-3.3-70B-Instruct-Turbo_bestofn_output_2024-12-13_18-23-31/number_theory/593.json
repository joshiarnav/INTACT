    "## Step 1: Convert $1001_2$ to base 10\nFirst, let's convert the binary number $1001_2$ into base 10. The number $1001_2$ can be broken down as follows: $1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0$. This calculation yields $8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9$.\n\n## Step 2: Convert $121_3$ to base 10\nNext, let's convert the ternary number $121_3$ into base 10. The number $121_3$ can be broken down as follows: $1*3^2 + 2*3^1 + 1*3^0$. This calculation yields $9 + 6 + 1 = 16$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the product of the two base 10 numbers\nNow, we multiply the two base 10 numbers obtained from the conversions: $9 * 16 = 144$.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{144}$",
    "## Step 1: Convert $1001_2$ to base 10.\nTo convert $1001_2$ to base 10, we need to calculate the powers of 2 multiplied by each digit of the binary number from right to left. The calculation is as follows: $1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9$.\n\n## Step 2: Convert $121_3$ to base 10.\nTo convert $121_3$ to base 10, we apply a similar process using powers of 3: $1*3^2 + 2*3^1 + 1*3^0 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the product of the two base 10 numbers.\nNow that we have both numbers in base 10, we can find their product by multiplying them together: $9 * 16 = 144$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{144}$",

  "solution": "In order to find the product of the two, we first convert both values into base 10. We have that $1001_2=1(2^3)+0(2^2)+0(2^1)+1(2^0)=8+1=9$, and that $121_3=1(3^2)+2(3^1)+1(3^0)=9+6+1=16$. The product of the two is just $(9)(16)=\\boxed{144}$.",
