    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the given equations\nWe have two equations in base 6: ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$ and ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$. We need to find the values of $A$, $B$, and $C$ to form the three-digit number ${ABC}$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the first equation in base 6\nFrom the first equation, ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$, we can infer that adding a one-digit number $C$ to a two-digit number $AB$ results in a two-digit number $C0$. This means $B + C$ must equal $0$ in base 6, which implies $B + C = 6$ in base 10 because there is no carry in base 6 that results in a zero in the units place without a carry to the next place.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the second equation in base 6\nFrom the second equation, ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$, we see that adding $AB$ and $BA$ gives $CC$. This implies that $A + B$ must have a carry in base 6 since the sum of two single-digit numbers in base 6 resulting in a two-digit number with the same digit repeated (like $CC$) is not possible without a carry.\n\n## Step 4: Break down the possibilities for $A$, $B$, and $C$\nGiven $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct non-zero digits less than 6, we can list the possible values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We also know from Step 2 that $B + C = 6$ in base 10, which limits the combinations further.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the possible combinations for $B$ and $C$\nGiven $B + C = 6$, the possible combinations are (1,5), (2,4), and (3,3), but since $B$ and $C$ must be distinct, (3,3) is not an option.\n\n## Step 6: Test the combinations with the second equation\nLet's test the combinations (1,5) and (2,4) with the second equation to see which one fits. If $B = 1$ and $C = 5$, then for ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$, $A + 1$ must carry over to make $C = 5$, which is not feasible since $A$ is at most 4 (because 5 is taken by $C$). If $B = 2$ and $C = 4$, then $A + 2$ needs to produce a carry for the tens place to be $C = 4$, which is plausible if $A$ is 3 or more, but $A$ must also be such that $A + B$ (in base 6) results in a carry to produce $C$ in the tens place.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $A$, $B$, and $C$ using both equations\nConsidering the carry from $A + B$ and knowing $B + C = 6$, let's try $B = 2$ and $C = 4$. For ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$, if $C = 4$, then $B + C$ should end in 0 in base 6, which aligns with our earlier deduction. For ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$, if $B = 2$ and $C = 4$, $A$ must be such that $A + 2$ (in base 6) produces a carry to make the tens place $4$. The only value that fits is $A = 3$ because $3 + 2 = 5$ in base 6, which carries over to make the tens place $4$ when adding $AB$ and $BA$.\n\n## Step 8: Verify the solution\nWith $A = 3$, $B = 2$, and $C = 4$, let's verify both equations. First, ${32_6}+{4_6}={40_6}$ checks out because $2 + 4 = 10$ in base 6, which is $0$ with a carry, and $3 + 0$ (from the carry) equals $3$, but since we're carrying, it becomes $4$ in the tens place, fitting our base 6 equation. Second, ${32_6}+{23_6}={44_6}$ also works because $2 + 3 = 5$ in base 6, which carries over, and $3 + 2$ plus the carry equals $10$ in base 6, which is $4$ with a carry, resulting in $44_6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{324}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and what is being asked\nWe are given two equations in base-6: ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$ and ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$. We need to find the three-digit number ${ABC}$ where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are non-zero distinct digits less than 6.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the first equation ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$\nIn base-6, when we add a one-digit number $C$ to a two-digit number $AB$, and the result is $C0$, it implies that the sum of $B$ and $C$ does not carry over to the next digit (since the result is $0$ in the units place), or if it does, the carry is absorbed in the tens place, resulting in $C$.\n\n## Step 3: Break down the first equation further\nFor the units place in the first equation, $B + C$ must equal $0$ in base-6, which means $B + C = 6$ since $B$ and $C$ are non-zero and distinct. This is because in base-6, the only way two single-digit numbers can sum to a number ending in $0$ is if their sum is $6$ (since $6$ is the base and would be represented as $10$ in base-6, but here it results in a carry and $0$ in the units place).\n\n## Step 4: Consider possible values for B and C\nGiven $B + C = 6$, possible pairs for $(B, C)$ are $(1, 5)$, $(2, 4)$, and $(3, 3)$, but since $B$ and $C$ must be distinct, $(3, 3)$ is not valid. So, we have two potential pairs: $(1, 5)$ and $(2, 4)$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the second equation ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$\nIn this equation, when adding $AB$ and $BA$, the resulting sum in the units place must be $C$ (since the result is ${CC_6}$), which means $A + B$ must end in $C$ when considering any potential carry from the addition of $B + A$ in the units place.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the possibilities from Step 4 to the second equation\nFor $(B, C) = (1, 5)$, $A + 1$ must end in $5$ in base-6, which is impossible since $A$ is less than 6 and adding 1 to any single-digit number less than 5 cannot result in 5. For $(B, C) = (2, 4)$, $A + 2$ must end in $4$ in base-6, which could be possible if $A = 2$, but $A$ and $B$ must be distinct.\n\n## Step 7: Re-evaluate the possibilities considering the constraints\nSince $A$ and $B$ must be distinct and $A + B$ should result in a number that ends with $C$ in base-6, let's reconsider the addition in base-6: For $B = 1$ and $C = 5$, there's no direct $A$ that fits. For $B = 4$ and $C = 2$, if $A = 5$, then $A + B = 5 + 4 = 13$ in base-6, which is $13_6$ or $1 \\times 6 + 3$, but this does not directly help as we need the result to be $CC_6$.\n\n## Step 8: Correctly solve the second equation with the right approach\nGiven that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct non-zero digits, let's directly apply the possible combinations to the second equation, ensuring we're considering base-6 arithmetic correctly. The mistake was in assuming direct additions without considering base-6 rules properly.\n\n## Step 9: Final analysis of both equations together\nConsidering both equations and the constraint that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct non-zero digits less than 6, let's directly evaluate which combinations satisfy both equations. The key insight is recognizing how numbers add up in base-6 and ensuring that the carry from one digit to the next is properly accounted for.\n\n## Step 10: Apply base-6 addition rules to find the correct combination\nIn base-6, for the equation ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$, if $B + C$ results in a carry (which would be the case since $B + C = 6$ as determined earlier), this carry must be absorbed by $A$ to result in $C$ for the tens place. Given the possible combinations, let's directly test them in both equations to find the valid combination.\n\n## Step 11: Solve for A, B, and C using both equations\nLet's directly solve the system considering the base-6 rules and the distinct, non-zero nature of $A$, $B$, and $C$. Given the earlier analysis, a detailed check of combinations is necessary to ensure no potential solution is overlooked.\n\n## Step 12: Final calculation and selection of A, B, and C\nAfter analyzing the possibilities and applying the base-6 arithmetic rules, the combination that fits both equations must be determined. This involves checking each possible combination of $A$, $B$, and $C$ that meets the criteria of being distinct, non-zero, and less than 6, and ensuring that both equations are satisfied.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{415}$",
    "## Step 1: Analyze the first equation in base-6\nThe first equation is ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$. In base-6, when a single digit $C$ is added to a two-digit number $AB$ and the result is $C0$, it implies that $B + C$ equals a number that ends in $0$ when expressed in base-6. This means $B + C = 6$ or $B + C = 12$ in base-10 because only these sums would result in a carry in base-6 that turns the tens place into $C$ and the ones place into $0$. However, since $B$ and $C$ are distinct digits less than 6, their sum cannot be 12. Thus, $B + C = 6$.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the possibilities for B and C\nGiven that $B + C = 6$ and both $B$ and $C$ are distinct non-zero digits less than 6, the possible pairs for $(B, C)$ are $(1, 5)$, $(2, 4)$, $(3, 3)$, $(4, 2)$, and $(5, 1)$. However, since $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct, and considering the constraints from the second equation as well, we can rule out $(3, 3)$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the second equation in base-6\nThe second equation is ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$. This implies that when you add $AB$ and $BA$ in base-6, the result is $CC$. In base-6, when adding two numbers, if the first digits ($A$ and $B$) sum to a value greater than or equal to 6, there will be a carry to the next place. For $A + B$ to result in a carry that makes the first digit of the sum $C$, we need to consider the possibilities where $A + B \\geq 6$ since $C$ is a non-zero digit.\n\n## Step 4: Combine insights from both equations\nConsidering both equations, for $B + C = 6$ and knowing that $A$, $B$, and $C$ must be distinct, we examine the possible combinations:\n- For $(B, C) = (1, 5)$, $A$ must be such that $A + 1 \\geq 6$ (considering carry), suggesting $A = 5$, but this contradicts $C$ being 5.\n- For $(B, C) = (2, 4)$, $A + 2 \\geq 6$ suggests $A = 4$, but again, $C$ is 4, causing a contradiction.\n- For $(B, C) = (4, 2)$, $A + 4 \\geq 6$ suggests $A$ could be 2 or greater. Since $A$ cannot be 2 (because $C$ is 2), $A$ could be greater, but it must also satisfy the equation $AB + BA = CC$.\n- For $(B, C) = (5, 1)$, $A + 5 \\geq 6$ suggests $A$ could be 1 or greater, but $A$ cannot be 1 because $C$ is 1.\n\n## Step 5: Detailed examination of the second equation for valid combinations\nGiven the constraints, let's examine the possibility of $(B, C) = (4, 2)$ more closely. If $B = 4$ and $C = 2$, then from the first equation, we have $A4_6 + 2_6 = 20_6$, implying $A + 4 = 2$ (with a carry of 1 to the tens place), which doesn't work because $A$ would be negative. This was an error in reasoning; correctly, we should consider how numbers in base-6 add up, focusing on the fact that $A$ and $B$ must add to a value that, when considering base-6, results in a carry that affects the tens place to make it equal to $C$.\n\n## Step 6: Re-evaluate the combination considering base-6 addition rules\nConsidering base-6 rules, when adding two digits, if their sum is greater than or equal to 6, a carry is generated. The correct approach is to find a combination where $A + B$ results in a carry that makes the first digit of the sum equal to $C$, and also satisfies $B + C = 6$.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the correct logic to find A, B, and C\nLet's apply the logic correctly: For $B + C = 6$, and considering the base-6 addition, if $B = 1$ and $C = 5$, we run into issues as seen before. The key is finding a combination where both equations are satisfied. Given the mistake in step 5, let's reconsider with correct base-6 addition logic.\n\n## Step 8: Final analysis with correct understanding of base-6\nIn base-6, for the equation $AB_6 + BA_6 = CC_6$, if $A$ and $B$ are added and the result is greater than or equal to 6, it carries over. Considering $B + C = 6$, let's correctly solve for $A$, $B$, and $C$ using both equations with proper base-6 logic.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for A, B, and C using both equations\nGiven ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$ and ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$, and knowing $B + C = 6$, let's find values that satisfy both equations. If $B = 1$ and $C = 5$, then for the second equation to be true, $A + B$ must carry over to make the tens place $C$. However, the direct approach to solving this requires considering all possible combinations that satisfy both the sum and the carry in base-6.\n\n## Step 10: Correctly identify A, B, and C\nGiven the constraints and re-evaluating the steps, we see that a detailed examination of base-6 addition and the constraints provided by both equations is necessary. Let's simplify: if $B + C = 6$ and both are less than 6, then possible pairs are limited. Considering the equation $AB_6 + BA_6 = CC_6$, and knowing that in base-6, the carry and sum must satisfy the equation, let's directly solve it.\n\n## Step 11: Final calculation\nSince $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct non-zero digits less than 6, and $B + C = 6$, let's consider the pairs $(1, 5)$, $(5, 1)$, $(2, 4)$, and $(4, 2)$. For $AB_6 + BA_6 = CC_6$, we need $A + B$ to equal $C$ or $C + 6$ (to account for carry). Given the equation and the need for $A$, $B$, and $C$ to be distinct, the combination that fits is $A = 4$, $B = 1$, and $C = 5$ because $41_6 + 14_6 = 55_6$ and $41_6 + 5_6 = 50_6$, satisfying both equations.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{415}$"
