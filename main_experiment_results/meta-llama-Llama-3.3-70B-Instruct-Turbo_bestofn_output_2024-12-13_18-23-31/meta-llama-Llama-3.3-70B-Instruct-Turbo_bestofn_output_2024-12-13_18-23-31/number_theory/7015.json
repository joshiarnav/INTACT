    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer whose cube ends in $888$.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the problem\nTo solve this, we can start by considering the properties of cubes and their last digits. Since the cube ends in $888$, we know that the last digit of the cube must be $8$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the possible last digits of the integer\nThe last digit of a cube can be determined by the last digit of the original number. We need to find which digit, when cubed, results in a last digit of $8$. By trying out the digits $0$ through $9$, we find that $2$ is the only digit whose cube ends in $8$ ($2^3 = 8$).\n\n## Step 4: Express the integer\nGiven that the cube of the integer $n$ ends in $888$, we can express $n$ as $10a + 2$, where $a$ is an integer representing all but the last digit of $n$.\n\n## Step 5: Expand the cube of the integer\nExpanding $(10a + 2)^3$, we get $1000a^3 + 600a^2 + 120a + 8$. For this to end in $888$, $1000a^3 + 600a^2 + 120a$ must end in $880$, or $1000a^3 + 600a^2 + 120a = 1000k + 880$ for some integer $k$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the equation\nThis simplifies to $5a^3 + 3a^2 + a = 5k + 4$ for some integer $k$, or $5(a^3 + \\frac{3}{5}a^2 + \\frac{1}{5}a) = 5k + 4$. Since $a$ is an integer, $a^3 + \\frac{3}{5}a^2 + \\frac{1}{5}a$ must be very close to an integer.\n\n## Step 7: Test values for a\nTesting successive values of $a$, we look for the first instance where the cube of $10a + 2$ ends in $888$.\n\n## Step 8: Perform trial and error to find the solution\nThrough trial and error or by solving the modular arithmetic, we can test values of $a$ starting from $0$ and increasing until we find the smallest value of $n = 10a + 2$ whose cube ends in $888$.\n\n## Step 9: Modular arithmetic approach\nAnother approach is to use modular arithmetic, specifically looking for $n$ such that $n^3 \\equiv 888 \\mod 1000$. This can help narrow down the possibilities for $n$ more systematically.\n\n## Step 10: Find the smallest n\nAfter testing or applying modular arithmetic, we find that the smallest positive integer $n$ whose cube ends in $888$ is $192$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{192}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer whose cube ends in $888$. This means we're looking for an integer $n$ such that $n^3 \\equiv 888 \\pmod{1000}$.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the modular arithmetic\nTo solve $n^3 \\equiv 888 \\pmod{1000}$, we can break it down into two separate modular equations: $n^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ and $n^3 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125}$, due to $888 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ and $888 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125}$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve $n^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, $n^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ implies that $n$ must be even, as any odd number cubed will be odd and thus cannot satisfy the condition of being divisible by $8$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve $n^3 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125}$\nWe need to find $n$ such that $n^3 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125}$. This requires checking values or using a more sophisticated approach like Euler's criterion or noticing patterns in cubes modulo 125.\n\n## Step 5: Consider possible values of $n$ modulo 125\nBy inspection or trial and error, we can look for values of $n$ such that $n^3 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125}$. Given the small range, it's feasible to check values manually or notice that since $n$ must be even (from Step 3), we can start with even values.\n\n## Step 6: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) if necessary\nOnce we have solutions to both $n^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ and $n^3 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125}$, we can apply the CRT to find the solution modulo 1000, which combines the solutions modulo 8 and 125.\n\n## Step 7: Find the smallest $n$ satisfying both conditions\nThrough calculation or further research, we find that $n=192$ is the smallest positive integer whose cube ends in $888$, as it satisfies both modular conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{192}$",
    "## Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nTo find the smallest positive integer whose cube ends in $888$, we need to consider how the last digits of a number behave when cubed. The last digit of the cube of any number is determined by the last digit of the original number.\n\n## Step 2: Breaking Down the Problem\nThe cube of a number $n$ can be expressed as $n^3$. We are looking for a number $n$ such that $n^3 \\equiv 888 \\mod 1000$. This means the last three digits of $n^3$ must be $888$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing the Last Digit\nFor the last digit of $n^3$ to be $8$, $n$ must end in $2$, because $2^3 = 8$, which is the only cube of a single-digit number that ends in $8$.\n\n## Step 4: Considering the Last Two Digits\nTo narrow down the possibilities for the last two digits of $n$, we need to find a number whose cube ends in $88$. By testing numbers that end in $2$, we can look for patterns or use modular arithmetic to find a suitable candidate.\n\n## Step 5: Modular Arithmetic Approach\nWe need $n^3 \\equiv 888 \\mod 1000$. This can be broken down into two congruences: $n^3 \\equiv 0 \\mod 8$ and $n^3 \\equiv 13 \\mod 125$. The first congruence is automatically satisfied if $n$ is even. For the second, we look for $n$ such that $n^3 \\equiv 13 \\mod 125$.\n\n## Step 6: Finding a Pattern for the Last Three Digits\nThrough examination or computation, we find that $192^3 = 7077888$, which ends in $888$. This suggests that the smallest positive integer whose cube ends in $888$ could be related to $192$.\n\n## Step 7: Confirming the Solution\nSince $192$ is the smallest number we found that satisfies the condition, and we've systematically considered how the last digits of numbers behave when cubed, $192$ is likely the smallest positive integer whose cube ends in $888$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{192}$"

  "solution": "$n^3 \\equiv 888 \\pmod{1000} \\implies n^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ and $n^3 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125}$. $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$ due to the last digit of $n^3$. Let $n = 5a + 2$. By expanding, $125a^3 + 150a^2 + 60a + 8 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125} \\implies 5a^2 + 12a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$.\nBy looking at the last digit again, we see $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod5$, so we let $a = 5a_1 + 3$ where $a_1 \\in \\mathbb{Z^+}$. Plugging this in to $5a^2 + 12a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$ gives $10a_1 + 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$. Obviously, $a_1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$, so we let $a_1 = 5a_2 + 2$ where $a_2$ can be any non-negative integer.\nTherefore, $n = 2 + 5(3+ 5(2+5a_2)) = 125a_2 + 67$. $n^3$ must also be a multiple of $8$, so $n$ must be even. $125a_2 + 67 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2 \\implies a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Therefore, $a_2 = 2a_3 + 1$, where $a_3$ is any non-negative integer. The number $n$ has form $125(2a_3+1)+67 = 250a_3+192$. So the minimum $n = \\boxed{192}$.",
