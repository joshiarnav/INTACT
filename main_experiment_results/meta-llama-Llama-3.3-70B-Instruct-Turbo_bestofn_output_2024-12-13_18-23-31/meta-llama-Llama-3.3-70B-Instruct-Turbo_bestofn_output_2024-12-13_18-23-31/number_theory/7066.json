    "## Step 1: Determine the product of the first 100 positive odd integers\nThe product of the first 100 positive odd integers can be represented as $P = 1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot ... \\cdot 199$. This can also be written as $P = \\frac{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot ... \\cdot 200}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot ... \\cdot 200} = \\frac{200!}{2^{100} \\cdot 100!}$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the prime factorization of P in terms of 3\nTo find the largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k$, we need to find the number of times 3 appears in the prime factorization of $P$. This involves finding the number of times 3 appears in the prime factorization of $200!$ and subtracting the number of times 3 appears in the prime factorization of $100!$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of times 3 appears in the prime factorization of 200!\nTo calculate the number of times 3 appears in the prime factorization of $200!$, we use the formula $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{9}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{27}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{81}\\right\\rfloor$. Applying this formula, we get $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{9}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{27}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{81}\\right\\rfloor = 66 + 22 + 7 + 2 = 97$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of times 3 appears in the prime factorization of 100!\nUsing the same formula, we calculate the number of times 3 appears in the prime factorization of $100!$: $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{3}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{9}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{27}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{81}\\right\\rfloor = 33 + 11 + 3 + 1 = 48$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the largest integer k such that P is divisible by 3^k\nThe largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k$ is the difference between the number of times 3 appears in the prime factorization of $200!$ and the number of times 3 appears in the prime factorization of $100!$. Therefore, $k =! 97 - 48 = 49$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{49}$",
