    "To find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3, we first need to identify the pattern these numbers follow.\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Odd multiples of 3 are those numbers which can be divided by 3 without leaving a remainder and are odd. The first few odd multiples of 3 are 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, ...\n\n2. **List the sequence**: The sequence of the first few odd multiples of 3 is 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57.\n\n3. **Find the tenth number**: By listing the sequence, we can see that the tenth number that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is 57.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57}$",
    "To find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3, we first need to understand what it means to be both odd and a multiple of 3.\n\n1. **Odd numbers** are those which cannot be divided evenly by 2. Examples include 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.\n2. **Multiples of 3** are numbers that can be divided evenly by 3. Examples include 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc.\n\nCombining these two conditions, we're looking for numbers that are odd and can be divided evenly by 3. This means we're looking at numbers like 3, 9, 15, 21, etc., because they are odd and multiples of 3.\n\nLet's list them out to find the tenth one:\n1. 3\n2. 9\n3. 15\n4. 21\n5. 27\n6. 33\n7. 39\n8. 45\n9. 51\n10. 57\n\nTherefore, the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is $\\boxed{57}$.",
    "To find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3, we first need to understand what kind of numbers we are looking for. \n\n1. **Odd numbers** are those which cannot be divided evenly by 2.

Examples include 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc.\n\nSince we need numbers that are both odd and multiples of 3, we look for numbers in the sequence of multiples of 3 and then filter out the even ones. \n\nThe sequence of multiples of 3 starts as 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, etc. Filtering out the even numbers (6, 12, 18, 24, 30), we are left with the odd multiples of 3: 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, etc.\n\nNow, we need to find the tenth number in this sequence of odd multiples of 3. To generate more numbers in the sequence, we continue the pattern:\n\n1. 3\n2. 9\n3. 15\n4. 21\n5. 27\n6. 33\n7. 39\n8. 45\n9. 51\n10. 57\n\nTherefore, the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is $\\boxed{57}$."

  "solution": "The first odd multiple of 3 is 3. The next is 9, then 15, 21, adding 6 each time. The $n$th odd multiple of 3 is $6n-3$; the 10th odd multiple of 3 is therefore $60-3=\\boxed{57}$.",
