    "## Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe problem requires finding an integer $n$ such that when $-3737$ is divided by $8$, the remainder is $n$. This is essentially what $n \\equiv -3737 \\pmod{8}$ means.\n\n## Step 2: Calculating the Remainder\nTo find $n$, we divide $-3737$ by $8$ and determine the remainder. The division can be done as follows: $-3737 \\div 8 = -467$ with a remainder. To find the remainder, we multiply $-467$ by $8$ and subtract this product from $-3737$.\n\n## Step 3: Performing the Calculation\n$-467 \\times 8 = -3736$. Subtracting this from $-3737$ gives $-3737 - (-3736) = -3737 + 3736 = -1$.\n\n## Step 4: Finding the Positive Remainder\nSince the remainder is $-1$ and we need a positive integer $n$ where $0 \\le n \\le 7$, we add $8$ to $-1$ to get a positive equivalent remainder within the specified range. Therefore, $-1 + 8 = 7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",

The division can be done as follows: $-3737 \\div 8 = -467$ with a remainder of $7$, since $-3737 = -467 \\times 8 + 7$. However, since we're looking for a positive $n$ and the remainder is $7$ when considering the absolute value, we should consider how negative numbers behave in modular arithmetic.\n\n## Step 3: Handling Negative Numbers in Modular Arithmetic\nIn modular arithmetic, a negative number $a$ can be adjusted to its positive equivalent by adding the modulus $m$ to it until it becomes positive. That is, if $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$, then $a + km \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ for any integer $k$. Since $-3737 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}$ directly, because $-3737 + 467 \\times 8 = 7$, our $n$ is indeed $7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
