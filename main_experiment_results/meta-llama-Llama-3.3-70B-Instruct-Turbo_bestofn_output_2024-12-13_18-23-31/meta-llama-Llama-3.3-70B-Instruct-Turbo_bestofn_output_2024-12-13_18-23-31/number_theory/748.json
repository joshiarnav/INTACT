    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the given equation\nWe have the fraction $\\frac{a}{a+27}$, where $a$ is a positive integer, and it equals $0.865$. Our goal is to find the value of $a$.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the decimal to a fraction for easier comparison\nFirst, let's convert $0.865$ into a fraction. $0.865 = \\frac{865}{1000} = \\frac{173}{200}$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation using the fraction\nNow, we set up the equation: $\\frac{a}{a+27} = \\frac{173}{200}$.\n\n## Step 4: Cross multiply to solve for $a$\nTo solve for $a$, we cross multiply: $200a = 173(a + 27)$.\n\n## Step 5: Expand and simplify the equation\nExpanding the equation gives: $200a = 173a + 4661$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $a$\nSubtract $173a$ from both sides to isolate $a$: $200a - 173a = 4661$.\nThis simplifies to $27a = 4661$.\nDivide both sides by $27$ to solve for $a$: $a = \\frac{4661}{27}$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the value of $a$\nPerform the division to find the value of $a$: $a = 173$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{173}$",
