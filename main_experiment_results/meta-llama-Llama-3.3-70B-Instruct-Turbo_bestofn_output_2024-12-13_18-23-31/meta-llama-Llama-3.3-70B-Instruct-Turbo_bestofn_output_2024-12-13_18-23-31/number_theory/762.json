    "## Step 1: Identify the pattern of units digits for powers of 21\nThe units digit of $21^1$ is 1, and since $1^6$ also ends in 1, we can observe that any power of 21 will have a units digit of 1.\n\n## Step 2: Use the units digit of the product to find the units digit of n\nGiven $mn = 21^6$, the units digit of $mn$ must be 1. We also know that $m$ has a units digit of 7.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the possible units digits of n\nTo find the units digit of $n$ such that when multiplied by 7 (the units digit of $m$) gives a units digit of 1, we consider which digit multiplied by 7 results in a number ending in 1.\n\n## Step 4: Test possible units digits\nTesting digits from 0 to 9, we find that $7 \\times 3 = 21$, which ends in 1.\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion\nTherefore, the units digit of $n$ that satisfies the condition given is 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the pattern of units digits for powers of 21\nSince $21^1 = 21$, $21^2 = 441$, $21^3 = 9261$, $21^4 = 194481$, $21^5 = 4084101$, and $21^6 = 85766121$, we can observe that the units digit of $21^n$ follows a pattern. For $21^1$, the units digit is 1, for $21^2$ it's 1, and this pattern continues because $1 \\times 1 = 1$, so the units digit of any power of 21 will always be 1.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the units digit of $mn$\nGiven $mn = 21^6$, and knowing the units digit of $21^6$ is 1, we understand that the product of the units digits of $m$ and $n$ must result in a number that ends in 1.\n\n## Step 3: Find the possible units digits for $n$\nGiven $m$ has a units digit of 7, we need to find a number $n$ such that when multiplied by 7, the result ends in 1. Possible units digits for $n$ that when multiplied by 7 result in a number ending in 1 are considered. Since $7 \\times 3 = 21$, which ends in 1, the units digit of $n$ must be 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the units digit of $n$ given that $mn = 21^6$ and $m$ has a units digit of 7.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the units digit of $21^6$\nThe units digit of $21^6$ can be found by looking at the pattern of units digits of powers of 1. Since $1^1 = 1$, $1^2 = 1$, and so on, the units digit of any power of 1 is always 1. However, we should also consider the units digit of $21$ specifically. The units digit of $21$ is 1, and when raised to any power, it remains 1. Thus, $21^6$ has a units digit of 1.\n\n## Step 3: Find the possible units digits of $n$\nSince $mn = 21^6$, the product of the units digits of $m$ and $n$ must equal the units digit of $21^6$, which is 1. Given that $m$ has a units digit of 7, we need to find a number $n$ such that when multiplied by 7, the result has a units digit of 1.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the units digit of $n$\nThe units digit of $n$ can be determined by finding a number that, when multiplied by 7, results in a units digit of 1. Going through the possible units digits (0-9) and multiplying each by 7, we look for the product that ends in 1. Since $7 \\times 3 = 21$, which has a units digit of 1, the units digit of $n$ must be 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
