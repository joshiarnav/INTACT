    "## Step 1: Determine the range of possible clever integers\nTo find clever integers, we need to look for even integers greater than 20 and less than 120. This means the range of possible clever integers is from 22 to 118.\n\n## Step 2: Identify which clever integers have a digit sum of 9\nWe need to find even numbers within the range where the sum of their digits equals 9. Possible combinations include 27 (2+7=9), 36 (3+6=9), 45 (4+5=9), 54 (5+4=9), 63 (6+3=9), 72 (7+2=9), 81 (8+1=9), 90 (9+0=9), 108 (1+0+8=9), and 117 (1+1+7=9). However, clever integers must be even, so we only consider 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108.\n\n## Step 3: Determine which clever integers are divisible by 27\nAmong the clever integers 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, we need to find which ones are divisible by 27. The numbers 54 and 108 are divisible by 27.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the fraction of clever integers divisible by 27\nThere are 5 clever integers in total (36, 54, 72, 90, 108), and 2 of them (54, 108) are divisible by 27. So, the fraction of clever integers divisible by 27 is 2/5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the range of possible clever integers.\nThe clever integers must be even, greater than 20, less than 120, and the sum of their digits must be 9. So, the range of clever integers starts from 22 (the first even number greater than 20) and ends at 118 (the last even number less than 120).\n\n## Step 2: Identify all possible clever integers within the given range.\nTo find the clever integers, we need to consider all even numbers between 22 and 118 and check which ones have a sum of digits equal to 9. The possible candidates are: 27 (not even, so excluded), 36, 45 (not even, so excluded), 54, 63 (not even, so excluded), 72, 81 (not even, so excluded), 90, 108, and 117 (not even and out of range, so excluded). Thus, the clever integers are 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108.\n\n## Step 3: Determine which clever integers are divisible by 27.\nFrom the list of clever integers (36, 54, 72, 90, 108), we need to find out which ones are divisible by 27. Checking each one: 36 is divisible by 27 (36 = 27 * 1.33, not divisible), 54 is divisible by 27 (54 = 27 * 2), 72 is not divisible by 27, 90 is not divisible by 27, and 108 is divisible by 27 (108 = 27 * 4). So, the clever integers divisible by 27 are 54 and 108.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the fraction of clever integers that are divisible by 27.\nTo find the fraction, we divide the number of clever integers divisible by 27 by the total number of clever integers. There are 2 clever integers divisible by 27 (54 and 108) and 5 clever integers in total (36, 54, 72, 90, 108). Thus, the fraction is 2/5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$",
    "## Step 1: Define the criteria for a \"clever integer\"\nA clever integer must be an even integer greater than 20, less than 120, and the sum of its digits must be 9.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the possible range of clever integers\nGiven that the integer must be greater than 20 and less than 120, we can start by listing the possible even numbers in this range that satisfy the condition of having a digit sum of 9.\n\n## Step 3: Identify even numbers between 20 and 120 with a digit sum of 9\nStarting from the lowest even number greater than 20, we check each even number to see if the sum of its digits equals 9. Possible candidates include 27 (2+7=9), 36 (3+6=9), 45 (4+5=9), 54 (5+4=9), 63 (6+3=9), 72 (7+2=9), 81 (8+1=9), 90 (9+0=9), 108 (1+0+8=9), and 117 (1+1+7=9). However, we must exclude odd numbers and numbers outside the specified range, leaving us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108 as potential clever integers.\n\n## Step 4: Filter the list to include only even numbers\nFrom the previous step, we already have only even numbers: 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108.\n\n## Step 5: Determine which clever integers are divisible by 27\nTo be divisible by 27, the number must be a multiple of 27. From our list of clever integers (36, 54, 72, 90, 108), we check each to see if it is divisible by 27. Only 54 and 108 are divisible by 27.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the fraction of clever integers divisible by 27\nWe have 5 clever integers in total (36, 54, 72, 90, 108) and 2 of them (54, 108) are divisible by 27. The fraction is therefore 2 out of 5, or 2/5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$"
