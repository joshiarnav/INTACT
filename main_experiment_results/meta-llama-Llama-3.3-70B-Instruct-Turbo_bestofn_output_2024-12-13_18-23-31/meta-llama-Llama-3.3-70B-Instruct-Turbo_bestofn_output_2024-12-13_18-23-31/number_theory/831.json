    "## Step 1: Pairing the terms of the series\nWe can pair the terms of the series $S = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + \\cdots + 2009 - 2010$ as follows: $(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + \\cdots + (2009 - 2010)$. Each pair sums to $-1$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculating the number of pairs\nThere are $2010/2 = 1005$ pairs in total because we are pairing two terms at a time.\n\n## Step 3: Calculating the sum of all pairs\nSince each pair sums to $-1$ and there are $1005$ pairs, the sum $S$ is equal to $-1 \\times 1005 = -1005$.\n\n## Step 4: Finding the residue modulo 2010\nTo find the residue of $S$ modulo 2010, we need to ensure the result is within the range $0$ to $2010 - 1$. Since $-1005$ is negative, we add $2010$ to it to get a positive equivalent residue within the desired range: $-1005 + 2010 = 1005$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1005}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the series\nThe series $S$ is an alternating sum of consecutive integers, starting from 1 and ending at 2010.\n\n## Step 2: Pair the terms of the series\nWe can pair the terms of the series as follows: $(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + \\cdots + (2009 - 2010)$.

  "solution": "Note that $x + 2010 \\equiv x \\pmod{2010}$. Add 2010 to every negative summand and rearrange the terms to find $S \\equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 2008 + 2009 \\pmod{2010}$. The right-hand side is the sum of the integers from 1 to 2010, so $S \\equiv \\frac{2010 \\cdot 2011}{2} \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 2011 \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 1 \\equiv \\boxed{1005} \\pmod{2010}$.",
