    "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nWe are given that when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. This can be expressed as $60 = qk^2 + 6$, where $q$ is the quotient of the division.\n\n## Step 2: Rewrite the equation\nRewrite the equation as $60 - 6 = qk^2$, which simplifies to $54 = qk^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Factorize 54\nSince $54 = 2 \\times 3^3$, and it is equal to $qk^2$, we need to find a perfect square that divides 54.\n\n## Step 4: Identify possible values for $k^2$\nThe perfect squares that divide 54 are $1$ and $9$ (since $1^2 = 1$ and $3^2 = 9$).\n\n## Step 5: Consider possible values for $k$\nGiven $k^2$ could be $1$ or $9$, $k$ could be $1$ or $3$ since $k$ is a positive integer.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$\nFor $k = 1$, the remainder when 100 is divided by $1$ is $0$. For $k = 3$, the remainder when 100 is divided by $3$ is $1$.\n\n## Step 7: Select the appropriate remainder\nSince $k = 1$ would imply that the remainder when 60 is divided by $k^2$ is 0 (which does not meet the condition given), $k$ must be $3$. Therefore, the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$ is $1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This can be expressed as $60 = qk^2 + 6$, where $q$ is the quotient of the division.\n\n## Step 2: Rearrange the equation to find a relationship between 54 and $k^2$\nRearranging the equation, we get $60 - 6 = qk^2$, which simplifies to $54 = qk^2$. This implies that $k^2$ is a factor of 54.\n\n## Step 3: Find the factors of 54\nThe factors of 54 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54. Since $k^2$ is a factor of 54, we need to consider the perfect square factors of 54.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the perfect square factors of 54\nThe perfect square factors of 54 are 1 and 9, as $1^2 = 1$ and $9^2 = 81$ is not a factor of 54, but $3^2 = 9$ is a factor of 54.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the possible values of $k$\nGiven that $k^2$ is a factor of 54 and $k$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $k$ are 1 and 3, since $1^2 = 1$ and $3^2 = 9$.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the case when $k = 1$\nIf $k = 1$, then $k^2 = 1$. However, when 60 is divided by 1, the remainder is 0, not 6. So, $k = 1$ does not satisfy the given condition.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the case when $k = 3$\nIf $k = 3$, then $k^2 = 9$. When 60 is divided by 9, the remainder is indeed 6. So, $k = 3$ satisfies the given condition.\n\n## Step 8: Find the remainder when 100 is divided by $k = 3$\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 100 is divided by 3. 100 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 33 and a remainder of 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

Since $k^2$ must divide 54 and $k$ is a positive integer, the possible values for $k$ are the square roots of the square factors of 54, which are $1^2 = 1$, $2^2 = 4$ (not a factor of 54), and $3^2 = 9$. Thus, $k$ could be 1 or 3 since $k$ must be an integer and $k^2$ must be a factor of 54.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the possible values of $k$ for the remainder condition\nFor $k = 1$, $k^2 = 1$, and dividing 60 by 1 gives a remainder of 0, not 6, so $k = 1$ does not satisfy the given condition.

  "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
