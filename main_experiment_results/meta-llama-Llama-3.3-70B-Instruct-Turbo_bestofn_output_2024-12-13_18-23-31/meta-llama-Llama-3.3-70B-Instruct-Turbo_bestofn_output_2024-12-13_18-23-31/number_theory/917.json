    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nTo find $2^{-1} \\pmod{185}$, we need to find the modular multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 185. This means finding an integer x such that $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$.\n\n## Step 2: Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm\nThe Extended Euclidean Algorithm can be used to find the modular multiplicative inverse. We need to find integers x and y such that $2x + 185y = 1$. However, since 2 and 185 are relatively prime (gcd(2,185) = 1), we know that the inverse exists.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm\nWe start by applying the Euclidean Algorithm to find the gcd of 2 and 185:\n- $185 = 2 \\times 92 + 1$\n- $2 = 1 \\times 2 + 0$\n\n## Step 4: Back-substitute to find x and y\nFrom the first equation, we can express 1 as a linear combination of 185 and 2:\n- $1 = 185 - 2 \\times 92$\n\nThus, $x = -92$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the residue of x modulo 185\nSince $x = -92$, to find the equivalent residue between 0 and 184, we add 185 to -92:\n- $x \\equiv -92 + 185 \\equiv 93 \\pmod{185}$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{93}$",

However, for small numbers, we can also proceed by trial and error or by using properties of modular arithmetic.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or inspection method\nSince 185 is not a large number, we can look for a multiple of 2 that is 1 more than a multiple of 185. Alternatively, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients of B\u00e9zout's identity, $2x + 185y = 1$, where $x$ is the inverse we seek.\n\n## Step 4: Perform calculations\nLet's start with the inspection method and simple calculations. We are looking for $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$. This means $2x = 1 + 185k$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for x\nTo solve for $x$, we need to find an $x$ that satisfies the equation $2x = 1 + 185k$. Given that we want the answer between 0 and 184, we look for the smallest positive $x$ that satisfies this equation.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse\nBy trying different values or using the algorithm, we notice that $2 \\times 93 = 186$, which is $1 + 185$.

This number $x$ is the modular inverse of 2 modulo 185.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the definition of modular inverse\nThe modular inverse of a number $a$ modulo $m$ is a number $x$ such that $ax \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$. In this case, we are looking for $x$ such that $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse\nThe Extended Euclidean Algorithm can be used to find the modular inverse.
