    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find an integer value for $n$ in the range $4 \\le n \\le 8$ that satisfies the congruence $n \\equiv 7882 \\pmod{5}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the modulus of 7882 by 5\nTo find the value that $n$ is congruent to mod 5, we calculate $7882 \\mod 5$. This means dividing 7882 by 5 and finding the remainder.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the calculation of 7882 mod 5\n$7882 \\div 5 = 1576$ with a remainder of $2$.
