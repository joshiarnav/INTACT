    "## Step 1: Subtract 1 from both sides of the equation\nFirst, we subtract 1 from both sides of the given congruence $8x + 1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$ to get $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$.\n\n## Step 2: Divide both sides by the greatest common factor of 8 and 12\nWe notice that 8 and 12 have a greatest common factor of 4. To simplify the equation, we divide both sides by 4, yielding $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, since dividing the modulus 12 by the greatest common factor 4 results in a new modulus of 3.\n\n## Step 3: Find the modular inverse of 2 modulo 3\nTo solve $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, we need to find the modular inverse of 2 modulo 3. The modular inverse of 2 modulo 3 is 2 itself because $2 \\times 2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n\n## Step 4: Multiply both sides by the modular inverse\nWe multiply both sides of the congruence $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ by 2, resulting in $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify a and m\nFrom the equation $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, we identify $a = 2$ and $m = 3$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate a + m\nFinally, we calculate $a + m = 2 + 3 = 5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given congruence equation\nThe given congruence equation is $8x + 1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$. This means that $8x + 1$ and $5$ have the same remainder when divided by $12$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the congruence equation\nTo simplify, subtract $1$ from both sides of the equation to get $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$.\n\n## Step 3: Reduce the coefficient of $x$ modulo $12$\nNotice that $8$ and $12$ share a common factor of $4$. To simplify the equation further and make the coefficient of $x$ smaller, we can divide both sides of the equation (including the modulus) by their greatest common divisor, which is $4$. This yields $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, since dividing the modulus $12$ by $4$ gives $3$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $x$\nNow, we need to find the value of $x$ that satisfies $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. To do this, we can try values of $x$ from $0$ to $2$ (since we're working modulo $3$) to see which one works. For $x = 0$, $2x = 0 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. For $x = 1$, $2x = 2 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. For $x = 2$, $2x = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ because $4$ divided by $3$ leaves a remainder of $1$.

    "To solve the given congruence $8x + 1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$, we'll proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, subtract 1 from both sides of the congruence to isolate the term involving $x$:\n\\[8x + 1 - 1 \\equiv 5 - 1 \\pmod{12}\\]\n\\[8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}\\]\n\nNext, we want to simplify the equation further if possible.
