    "## Step 1: Identify the common difference in each arithmetic progression\nThe common difference in the first arithmetic progression is $5 - 2 = 3$, and the common difference in the second arithmetic progression is $10 - 3 = 7$.\n\n## Step 2: Express the terms of each arithmetic progression using a formula\nFor the first arithmetic progression, the nth term can be expressed as $2 + 3(n - 1)$, and for the second arithmetic progression, the nth term can be expressed as $3 + 7(n - 1)$.\n\n## Step 3: Set the two formulas equal to each other to find the common terms\nTo find the common terms, we need to set the two formulas equal to each other: $2 + 3(n - 1) = 3 + 7(n - 1)$. We will solve for n.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for n\n$2 + 3n - 3 = 3 + 7n - 7$\n$3n - 1 = 7n - 4$\n$-1 + 4 = 7n - 3n$\n$3 = 4n$\n$n = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nHowever, since n must be an integer, the approach in step 3 was incorrect. Instead, we should look for the first term where the two sequences could potentially intersect by finding the first number in each sequence that is greater than the first term of the other sequence.\n\n## Step 5: Find the first few terms of each sequence to look for a pattern or intersection\nFirst sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 56, 59, 62, 65, 68, 71, 74, 77, 80, 83, 86, 89, 92, 95, 98, 101, 104, 107, 110, 113, 116, 119, 122, 125, 128, 131, 134, 137, 140, 143, 146, 149, 152, 155, 158, 161, 164, 167, 170, 173, 176, 179, 182, 185, 188, 191, 194, 197, 200, ...\nSecond sequence: 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 52, 59, 66, 73, 80, 87, 94, 101, 108, 115, 122, 129, 136, 143, 150, 157, 164, 171, 178, 185, 192, 199, ...\n\n## Step 6: Identify the common terms from the lists generated in step 5\nFrom the lists, we can see that the common terms are 17, 38, 59, 80, 101, 122, 143, 164, 185, 206, 227, 248, 269, 290, 311, 332, 353, 374, 395, 416, 437, 458, 479.\n\n## Step 7: Find the largest common term less than 500\nThe largest value less than 500 that the two sequences have in common is 479.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{479}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the common difference in each arithmetic progression\nThe common difference in the first progression $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$ is $3$ (since $5 - 2 = 3$), and the common difference in the second progression $\\{3, 10, 17, 24, \\ldots \\}$ is $7$ (since $10 - 3 = 7$).\n\n## Step 2: Express the terms of each progression using a formula\nFor the first progression, the nth term can be expressed as $2 + 3(n - 1)$, and for the second progression, the nth term can be expressed as $3 + 7(n - 1)$.\n\n## Step 3: Set the two formulas equal to each other to find common terms\nTo find the common terms, we set $2 + 3(n - 1) = 3 + 7(n - 1)$ and solve for $n$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for n\nExpanding both sides gives $2 + 3n - 3 = 3 + 7n - 7$. Simplifying, we get $3n - 1 = 7n - 4$. Rearranging the equation to solve for $n$, we subtract $3n$ from both sides to get $-1 = 4n - 4$. Adding $4$ to both sides gives $3 = 4n$. Dividing both sides by $4$ yields $n = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\n## Step 5: Realize the mistake in step 4 and correct the approach\nThe approach in step 4 was incorrect because we're looking for a common value that satisfies both sequences, not the value of n that makes the two sequences equal at the same term number. Instead, we should look for values that satisfy both $2 + 3k = 3 + 7m$ for some integers $k$ and $m$.\n\n## Step 6: Correctly solve for common terms\nTo find a common term, we need to find integers $k$ and $m$ such that $2 + 3k = 3 + 7m$. This can be rearranged as $3k - 7m = 1$. This is a linear Diophantine equation.\n\n## Step 7: Solve the Diophantine equation\nTo solve $3k - 7m = 1$, we can use the method of finding a particular solution and then the general solution. A particular solution can be found by inspection or trial and error. One particular solution is $k = 5$ and $m = 2$ because $3*5 - 7*2 = 15 - 14 = 1$.\n\n## Step 8: Find the general solution for k and m\nThe general solution for $k$ and $m$ can be expressed as $k = 5 + 7t$ and $m = 2 + 3t$, where $t$ is any integer.\n\n## Step 9: Substitute the general solution back into one of the original sequences\nSubstituting $k = 5 + 7t$ into the first sequence formula, we get the common term as $2 + 3(5 + 7t - 1) = 2 + 3(4 + 7t) = 2 + 12 + 21t = 14 + 21t$.\n\n## Step 10: Find the largest common term less than 500\nNow, we need to find the largest $t$ for which $14 + 21t < 500$. This involves solving the inequality $14 + 21t < 500$ for $t$.\n\n## Step 11: Solve the inequality for t\nSubtract 14 from both sides to get $21t < 486$. Divide both sides by 21 to get $t < \\frac{486}{21}$. Simplifying, $t < 23.142857...$. Since $t$ must be an integer, the largest possible value for $t$ is $23$.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the largest common term less than 500\nUsing $t = 23$, the largest common term less than 500 is $14 + 21*23 = 14 + 483 = 497$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{497}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the common difference in each arithmetic progression.\nThe common difference in the first progression $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$ is $5 - 2 = 3$. The common difference in the second progression $\\{3, 10, 17, 24, \\ldots \\}$ is $10 - 3 = 7$.\n\n## Step 2: Express the terms of each progression using a formula.\nFor the first progression, the nth term can be expressed as $2 + 3(n - 1)$, which simplifies to $3n - 1$. For the second progression, the nth term can be expressed as $3 + 7(n - 1)$, which simplifies to $7n - 4$.\n\n## Step 3: Set the two formulas equal to each other to find the common terms.\nTo find where they intersect, we set $3n - 1 = 7m - 4$, where $n$ and $m$ are integers representing the term numbers in each progression.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for one variable in terms of the other.\nRearranging the equation gives $3n = 7m - 3$. Solving for $n$ yields $n = \\frac{7m - 3}{3}$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the conditions for n to be an integer.\nFor $n$ to be an integer, $7m - 3$ must be divisible by 3. This means $7m - 3$ is a multiple of 3, or $7m \\equiv 0 \\mod 3$. Since 7 is not divisible by 3, $m$ must be chosen such that $7m$ leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 3, which simplifies to finding $m$ where $m \\equiv 1 \\mod 3$ (because $7 \\times 1 = 7$, and $7 \\mod 3 = 1$), to satisfy the equation $7m \\equiv 3 \\mod 3$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the first few values of m that satisfy the condition.\nThe values of $m$ that satisfy $m \\equiv 1 \\mod 3$ include $1, 4, 7, 10, \\ldots$. We need to test these values to find corresponding $n$ values that are integers.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the corresponding n values and the common terms.\nFor $m = 1$, $n = \\frac{7 \\times 1 - 3}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}$, which is not an integer.\nFor $m = 4$, $n = \\frac{7 \\times 4 - 3}{3} = \\frac{25}{3}$, which is not an integer.\nFor $m = 7$, $n = \\frac{7 \\times 7 - 3}{3} = \\frac{46}{3}$, which is not an integer.\nContinuing this pattern, we look for $m$ where the calculation yields an integer $n$.\n\n## Step 8: Correctly apply the condition to find a suitable m.\nLet's correct the approach by directly finding a common term through the equation $3n - 1 = 7m - 4$ and ensuring both $n$ and $m$ are integers. This requires testing values or finding a pattern that satisfies both sequences.\n\n## Step 9: Apply a correct method to find common terms.\nTo find common terms, we can list terms from each sequence and look for overlaps or use a systematic approach to solve for $n$ and $m$ where both are integers. However, a more efficient method involves recognizing that common terms must satisfy both $3n - 1$ and $7m - 4$.\n\n## Step 10: Recognize the need for a systematic approach to solve for common terms.\nGiven the sequences $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$ and $\\{3, 10, 17, 24, \\ldots \\}$, we look for terms that appear in both. This involves either listing terms until a common term is found or using the equations $3n - 1$ and $7m - 4$ to solve for $n$ and $m$ systematically.\n\n## Step 11: Solve the system of linear equations with a correct approach.\nWe need to find integers $n$ and $m$ such that $3n - 1 = 7m - 4$. This can be rearranged as $3n = 7m - 3$. To find a solution, we can use substitution or elimination methods, keeping in mind that $n$ and $m$ must be integers.\n\n## Step 12: Apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem or similar method.\nSince we're looking for values that satisfy both progressions, and given their differences (3 and 7), using the Chinese Remainder Theorem or a similar approach might provide a direct method to find common terms.\n\n## Step 13: Find the first common term.\nBy inspection or trial and error, we can start listing terms of both sequences until we find a match: Sequence 1: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 56, 59, 62, 65, 68, 71, 74, 77, 80, 83, 86, 89, 92, 95, 98, 101, 104, 107, 110, 113, 116, 119, 122, 125, 128, 131, 134, 137, 140, 143, 146, 149, 152, 155, 158, 161, 164, 167, 170, 173, 176, 179, 182, 185, 188, 191, 194, 197, 200, 203, 206, 209, 212, 215, 218, 221, 224, 227, 230, 233, 236, 239, 242, 245, 248, 251, 254, 257, 260, 263, 266, 269, 272, 275, 278, 281, 284, 287, 290, 293, 296, 299, 302, 305, 308, 311, 314, 317, 320, 323, 326, 329, 332, 335, 338, 341, 344, 347, 350, 353, 356, 359, 362, 365, 368, 371, 374, 377, 380, 383, 386, 389, 392, 395, 398, 401, 404, 407, 410, 413, 416, 419, 422, 425, 428, 431, 434, 437, 440, 443, 446, 449, 452, 455, 458, 461, 464, 467, 470, 473, 476, 479, 482, 485, 488, 491, 494, 497; Sequence 2: 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 52, 59, 66, 73, 80, 87, 94, 101, 108, 115, 122, 129, 136, 143, 150, 157, 164, 171, 178, 185, 192, 199, 206, 213, 220, 227, 234, 241, 248, 255, 262, 269, 276, 283, 290, 297, 304, 311, 318, 325, 332, 339, 346, 353, 360, 367, 374, 381, 388, 395, 402, 409, 416, 423, 430, 437, 444, 451, 458, 465, 472, 479, 486, 493. The first common term is 17 (where $n=6$ and $m=3$), but we need the largest value less than 500.\n\n## Step 14: Calculate subsequent common terms.\nGiven that 17 is a common term, and knowing the least common multiple (LCM) of the common differences (3 and 7) is 21, we can find subsequent common terms by adding 21 to the previous common term until we reach a value close to 500.\n\n## Step 15: List common terms less than 500.\nStarting with 17, we add 21 successively: 17, 38, 59, 80, 101, 122, 143, 164, 185, 206, 227, 248, 269, 290, 311, 332, 353, 374, 395, 416, 437, 458, 479. The largest common term less than 500 is 479.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{479}$"
