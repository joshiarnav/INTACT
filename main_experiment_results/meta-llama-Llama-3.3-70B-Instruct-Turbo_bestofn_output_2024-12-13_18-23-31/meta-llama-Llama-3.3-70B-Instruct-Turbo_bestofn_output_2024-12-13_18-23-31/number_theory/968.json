    "## Step 1: Recall the property of the number of factors of a given number\nA number with exactly three factors must be the square of a prime number, because its factors are 1, the prime number itself, and the square of the prime number.\n\n## Step 2: Express x, y, and z in terms of prime numbers\nGiven the property from Step 1, we can express $x$, $y$, and $z$ as $x=p^2$, $y=q^2$, and $z=r^2$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are distinct prime numbers.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the prime factorization of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$\nSubstitute $x$, $y$, and $z$ from Step 2 into $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ to get $(p^2)^{2}(q^2)^{3}(r^2)^{4} = p^{4}q^{6}r^{8}$.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the formula to find the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$\nThe number of factors of any composite number $a^{m}b^{n}c^{o}$ (where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are distinct prime numbers) is given by $(m+1)(n+1)(o+1)$. For $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4} = p^{4}q^{6}r^{8}$, the number of factors would be $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of factors\nUsing the formula from Step 4, we find the number of factors: $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1) = 5 \\times 7 \\times 9$.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the multiplication\n$5 \\times 7 \\times 9 = 315$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{315}$",

  "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",
