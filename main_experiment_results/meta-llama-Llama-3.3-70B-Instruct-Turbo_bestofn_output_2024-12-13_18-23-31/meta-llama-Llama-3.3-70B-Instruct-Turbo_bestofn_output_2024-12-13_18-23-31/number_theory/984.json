  "problem": "Natural numbers of the form $F_n=2^{2^n} + 1 $ are called Fermat numbers. In 1640, Fermat conjectured that all numbers $F_n$, where $n\\neq 0$, are prime. (The conjecture was later shown to be false.) What is the units digit of $F_{1000}$?",

    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and recall the properties of Fermat numbers.\nFermat numbers are of the form $F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1$, and we are asked to find the units digit of $F_{1000}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the pattern of units digits for powers of 2.\nWhen raising 2 to different powers, the units digits follow a pattern: 2, 4, 8, 6, and then the pattern repeats.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze how the pattern applies to $2^{2^n}$.\nFor $2^{2^n}$, the exponent $2^n$ will always be an even number because $2^n$ is multiplied by itself. This means we're looking at the powers of 2 raised to even powers, which always result in the last two digits being part of the pattern 4, 6 (from 2^2 = 4, 2^4 = 16, etc.), but since $2^n$ grows rapidly, we simplify our view to the fact that $2^{2^n}$ ends in 6 for $n > 1$ because any power of 2, when squared (making it an even exponent), ends in 6 if the original power of 2 is greater than 1.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the impact of adding 1 to $2^{2^n}$.\nAdding 1 to a number that ends in 6 results in a number that ends in 7.\n\n## Step 5: Apply this understanding to $F_{1000}$.\nGiven that $F_{1000} = 2^{2^{1000}} + 1$, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ will be 6, and therefore the units digit of $F_{1000}$ will be 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",

This pattern occurs because $2^1 = 2$, $2^2 = 4$, $2^3 = 8$, $2^4 = 16$ (units digit is 6), $2^5 = 32$ (units digit is 2), and so on.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the pattern to $2^{2^n}$\nFor $2^{2^n}$, we are interested in the exponent $2^n$. Since the pattern of units digits for $2^x$ repeats every 4 powers, we need to find the remainder when $2^{1000}$ is divided by 4 to determine the position in the pattern.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $2^{1000}$ modulo 4\nAny even number squared is divisible by 4 (since $2^2 = 4$), and thus $2^{1000}$, being an even number itself (specifically, a power of 2), when squared, will result in a number that is a multiple of 4. This means $2^{1000}$ modulo 4 equals 0.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the units digit based on the pattern\nSince $2^{1000}$ modulo 4 equals 0, it signifies the last step in the repeating pattern (2, 4, 8, 6) before it repeats. However, this step is about understanding the cycle, but we actually need to look at the power of 2 that results from $2^{2^{1000}}$. Given that $2^{1000}$ is a multiple of 4, the power of 2, $2^{2^{1000}}$, will have a units digit that corresponds to the end of a complete cycle in the pattern (2, 4, 8, 6), which is 6.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the effect of adding 1 to the units digit\nThe Fermat number $F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1$, so we add 1 to the units digit found in the previous step. Since the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6, adding 1 gives us a units digit of 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",

  "solution": "Let's first try to find the cycle of units digits of $2^n$, starting with $n=1$: $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $2^n$ is 4 digits long: 2, 4, 8, 6.
