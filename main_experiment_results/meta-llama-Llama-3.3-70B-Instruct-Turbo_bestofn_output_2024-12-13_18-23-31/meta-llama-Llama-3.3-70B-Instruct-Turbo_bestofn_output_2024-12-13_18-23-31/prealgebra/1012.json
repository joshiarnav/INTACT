    "## Step 1: Understanding the problem\nWe need to express the sum of two repeating decimals, $0.\\overline{3}$ and $0.\\overline{2}$, as a common fraction.\n\n## Step 2: Converting repeating decimals to fractions\nTo convert $0.\\overline{3}$ to a fraction, let $x = 0.\\overline{3}$. Then $10x = 3.\\overline{3}$. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives $9x = 3$, so $x = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n## Step 3: Converting the second repeating decimal to a fraction\nTo convert $0.\\overline{2}$ to a fraction, let $y = 0.\\overline{2}$. Then $10y = 2.\\overline{2}$. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives $9y = 2$, so $y = \\frac{2}{9}$.\n\n## Step 4: Adding the two fractions\nNow, we add the two fractions together: $\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9}$. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is $9$. So we convert $\\frac{1}{3}$ to $\\frac{3}{9}$.\n\n## Step 5: Performing the addition\n$\\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$",

To convert this to a fraction, we can use the property of repeating decimals. Multiplying $x$ by $10$ gives $10x = 3.\\overline{3}$.

Subtracting $y$ from $10y$ gives $9y = 2$, so $y = \\frac{2}{9}$.\n\n## Step 4: Add the two fractions\nNow that we have $0.\\overline{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$ and $0.\\overline{2} = \\frac{2}{9}$, we can add them together.

  "solution": "In general, to express the number $0.\\overline{n}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $10x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&10x &=& n&.nnnnn\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.nnnnn\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&9x &=& n &\n\\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\\overline{n} = \\frac{n}{9}$.\n\nHence, our original problem reduces to computing $\\frac 39 + \\frac 29 = \\boxed{\\frac 59}$.",
