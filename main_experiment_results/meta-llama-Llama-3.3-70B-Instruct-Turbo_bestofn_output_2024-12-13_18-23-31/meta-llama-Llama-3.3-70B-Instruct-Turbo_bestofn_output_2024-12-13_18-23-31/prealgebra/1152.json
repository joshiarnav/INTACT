    "## Step 1: Identify the second smallest prime number\nThe smallest prime number is 2. The second smallest prime number is 3.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the square of the second smallest prime number\nTo find the square of 3, we calculate $3^2 = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the cube of the result from step 2\nNow, we need to find the cube of 9. The cube of 9 is $9^3 = 9 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 729$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{729}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the second smallest prime number.\nThe smallest prime number is 2. The next prime number, and thus the second smallest, is 3.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the square of the second smallest prime number.\nTo find the square of 3, we calculate $3^2 = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the cube of the result from step 2.\nTo find the cube of 9, we calculate $9^3 = 9 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 729$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{729}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the prime numbers\nFirst, we need to identify the prime numbers. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the second smallest prime number\nFrom the list of prime numbers, we can see that the second smallest prime number is 3.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the square of the second smallest prime number\nTo calculate the square of 3, we multiply 3 by itself: $3^2 = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the cube of the result\nNow, we need to calculate the cube of 9. The cube of a number is obtained by multiplying the number by itself three times: $9^3 = 9 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 729$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{729}$"
