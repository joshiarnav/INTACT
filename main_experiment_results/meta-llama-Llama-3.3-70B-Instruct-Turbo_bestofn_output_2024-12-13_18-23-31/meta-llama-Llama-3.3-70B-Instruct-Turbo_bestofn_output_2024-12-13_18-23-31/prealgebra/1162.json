    "## Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the hoodie\nThe total cost of the hoodie is $32.75.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Chloe has from the three $10 bills\nThree $10 bills equal $30.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Chloe has from the eight quarters\nEight quarters equal 8 * $0.25 = $2.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the remaining amount needed to pay for the hoodie after using the $10 bills and quarters\nThe remaining amount needed is $32.75 - $30 - $2 = $0.75.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the minimum number of dimes needed to cover the remaining amount\nSince each dime is worth $0.10, the minimum number of dimes needed is $0.75 / $0.10 = 7.5. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a dime, Chloe needs to have at least 8 dimes to cover the remaining amount.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
    "## Step 1: Calculate the total amount Chloe has from the three $10 bills.\nChloe has 3 * $10 = $30 from the three $10 bills.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total amount Chloe has from the eight quarters.\nSince each quarter is $0.25, Chloe has 8 * $0.25 = $2 from the eight quarters.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount needed to buy the hoodie after using the $10 bills and the quarters.\nThe total amount Chloe has so far is $30 + $2 = $32. The hoodie costs $32.75, so she still needs $32.75 - $32 = $0.75.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the minimum number of dimes needed to cover the remaining amount.\nSince each dime is $0.10, to find the minimum number of dimes needed, we divide the remaining amount by the value of one dime: $0.75 / $0.10 = 7.5. Since we cannot have half a dime, Chloe needs 8 dimes to have at least $0.75.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",

  "solution": "Let $n$ represent the unknown number of dimes. Chloe's total amount of money is $$3(\\$10)+8(\\$.25)+n(\\$.10) \\ge \\$32.75.$$Simplifying gives  \\begin{align*}\n30+2+.10n &\\ge 32.75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\n.10n &\\ge .75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge \\frac{.75}{.10} \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge 7.5.\n\\end{align*}Chloe must have at least $\\boxed{8}$ dimes in her pile.",
