    "## Step 1: Recall the Pythagorean Theorem\nThe Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b), or \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). Here, we know \\(c = 39\\) units.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the Problem's Constraint\nWe are looking for integer lengths of the sides, which means both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be integers. The problem asks for the length of the shorter leg, so we are looking to find the smaller of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem with Known Hypotenuse\nGiven \\(c = 39\\), we have \\(a^2 + b^2 = 39^2\\). So, \\(a^2 + b^2 = 1521\\).\n\n## Step 4: Consider Possible Integer Combinations\nTo find integer solutions, we can look for Pythagorean triples that satisfy the equation. A common method is to iterate through possible values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but given the large hypotenuse, it's more efficient to look for patterns or use known Pythagorean triples and see if they can be scaled up.\n\n## Step 5: Recall or Derive a Relevant Pythagorean Triple\nOne of the simpler Pythagorean triples is \\(3, 4, 5\\), but scaling this up to match a hypotenuse of 39 does not yield an integer solution directly. Another approach is to recognize that \\(39 = 3 \\times 13\\), suggesting we might find a multiple of a basic Pythagorean triple that fits.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the Relevant Pythagorean Triple\nThe Pythagorean triple \\(5, 12, 13\\) can be scaled by a factor of 3 to give \\(15, 36, 39\\), which matches our hypotenuse. This is derived from recognizing \\(39 = 3 \\times 13\\), and knowing \\(5, 12, 13\\) is a Pythagorean triple.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the Shorter Leg\nFrom the scaled Pythagorean triple \\(15, 36, 39\\), the shorter leg is \\(15\\) units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",
    "## Step 1: Recall the Pythagorean Theorem\nThe Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b), which can be expressed as \\(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\\). Here, we know that \\(c = 39\\).\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem\nGiven \\(c = 39\\), we have \\(39^2 = a^2 + b^2\\). So, \\(1521 = a^2 + b^2\\).\n\n## Step 3: Determine Possible Values for a and b\nSince we're dealing with integer lengths and looking for the shorter leg, we need to find integer values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) that satisfy the equation. This involves factoring or recognizing Pythagorean triples that could fit, given that 39 is a multiple of 3, a common factor in some Pythagorean triples.\n\n## Step 4: Identify Relevant Pythagorean Triples\nOne way to simplify the search is to recognize common Pythagorean triples and see if any can be scaled up to have a hypotenuse of 39. A well-known Pythagorean triple is 3-4-5. However, we need to check if there's a multiple of this or another triple that results in a hypotenuse of 39.\n\n## Step 5: Check for Factorization\nTo simplify the calculation, we can also look for factors of 1521 that are perfect squares, which would directly give us \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). However, given the nature of the problem, it's more efficient to look for patterns or known triples that fit.\n\n## Step 6: Apply Knowledge of Pythagorean Triples\nA less common triple that fits is 15-36-39. This is derived from the basic 5-12-13 triple scaled by 3. Checking this, \\(15^2 + 36^2 = 225 + 1296 = 1521 = 39^2\\), confirming that 15 and 36 are indeed the legs of a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 39.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the Shorter Leg\nBetween 15 and 36, the shorter leg is 15.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",
    "## Step 1: Recall the Pythagorean Theorem\nThe Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be expressed as \\(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\\), where \\(c\\) is the length of the hypotenuse, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the lengths of the other two sides.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to the Problem\nGiven that the hypotenuse \\(c = 39\\) units, we can substitute this into the Pythagorean Theorem equation to get \\(39^2 = a^2 + b^2\\). This simplifies to \\(1521 = a^2 + b^2\\).\n\n## Step 3: Determine the Possible Values of a and b\nSince we are looking for integer length sides and we want to find the shorter leg, we need to find integer values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) that satisfy the equation \\(1521 = a^2 + b^2\\). Given that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be integers, and knowing that one of these values will be the shorter leg, we can start by testing possible values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), keeping in mind that \\(a < b\\) if \\(a\\) is the shorter leg.\n\n## Step 4: Identify Pythagorean Triples\nIt's helpful to recall Pythagorean triples, which are sets of three integers that satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem. However, not all triples will have a hypotenuse of 39. We need to specifically find a pair whose hypotenuse is 39.\n\n## Step 5: Test Possible Combinations\nTo simplify the testing, we can look for known Pythagorean triples that could be scaled up to have a hypotenuse of 39. Since 39 is a multiple of 3, we might look for a basic Pythagorean triple that can be multiplied by 3 to get closer to our target hypotenuse length.\n\n## Step 6: Recall Basic Pythagorean Triples\nOne of the basic Pythagorean triples is 3-4-5. Multiplying each of these by a factor could give us a hypotenuse of 39 if the factor is correct. Let's calculate: if we multiply 3-4-5 by a factor, we get \\(3x - 4x - 5x\\). We need \\(5x = 39\\), so \\(x = 39 / 5\\), which is not an integer.\n\n## Step 7: Consider Other Triples\nAnother method is to look for factors of 1521 that are perfect squares, which would directly give us \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). However, without a straightforward way to factor 1521 into two perfect squares, we should consider other small Pythagorean triples.\n\n## Step 8: Examine Factorization of 1521\nWe look for pairs of squares that add up to 1521. Knowing some common Pythagorean triples can help. For instance, the 15-36-39 triple is a known Pythagorean triple.\n\n## Step 9: Identify the Correct Triple\nRecognizing that 15-36-39 is indeed a Pythagorean triple because \\(15^2 + 36^2 = 225 + 1296 = 1521 = 39^2\\), we can conclude that the lengths of the sides of the triangle are 15, 36, and 39 units.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the Shorter Leg\nBetween 15 and 36, the shorter leg is 15 units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
