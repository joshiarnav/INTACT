    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks for the percentage of $x$ that equals $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$. This means we need to find a percentage $p$ such that $p\\%$ of $x$ is equal to $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$\nFirst, we find $50\\%$ of $x$, which is $0.5x$. Then, $40\\%$ of $0.5x$ is $0.4 \\times 0.5x = 0.2x$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation for $p\\%$ of $x$\nWe are looking for $p$ such that $p\\%$ of $x$ equals $0.2x$. The equation for this is $\\frac{p}{100}x = 0.2x$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $p$\nDividing both sides of the equation by $x$ gives $\\frac{p}{100} = 0.2$. Multiplying both sides by $100$ gives $p = 20$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nThe problem asks for a percentage of $x$ that equals $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$. This involves finding a fraction of $x$ that is equivalent to the specified percentages of $x$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$\nTo find $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$, we first calculate $50\\%$ of $x$, which is $0.5x$, and then find $40\\%$ of this result. $40\\%$ of $0.5x$ is $0.4 \\times 0.5x = 0.2x$.\n\n## Step 3: Express the result as a percentage of $x$\nWe need to find what percentage of $x$ equals $0.2x$. This can be expressed as $(0.2x / x) \\times 100$ to convert it into a percentage.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the percentage\n$(0.2x / x) \\times 100 = 0.2 \\times 100 = 20\\%$.
