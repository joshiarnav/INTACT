    "## Step 1: Understand what is being asked\nWe are asked to find the number of distinct prime factors of the number 210.\n\n## Step 2: Factorize 210 into its prime factors\nTo find the distinct prime factors, we first need to factorize 210. We start by breaking it down into its simplest factors: 210 = 2 * 105.\n\n## Step 3: Continue factorizing until we reach prime numbers\nWe continue factorizing 105, which can be broken down into 3 * 35. Then, breaking down 35 into 5 * 7. So, we have 210 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the distinct prime factors\nFrom the factorization, we find that the distinct prime factors of 210 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n## Step 5: Count the distinct prime factors\nWe count the distinct prime factors identified in the previous step. There are 4 distinct prime factors.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
    "## Step 1: First, we need to find the prime factorization of 210.\nTo find the prime factorization, we start by dividing 210 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n\n## Step 2: Divide 210 by 2.\n210 divided by 2 equals 105.\n\n## Step 3: Now, we need to continue factoring 105.\nWe look for the next smallest prime number that can divide 105. Since 105 is odd, we start with 3, which is the next smallest prime number after 2.\n\n## Step 4: Divide 105 by 3.\n105 divided by 3 equals 35.\n\n## Step 5: Continue factoring 35.\nWe look for the next prime number that can divide 35.
