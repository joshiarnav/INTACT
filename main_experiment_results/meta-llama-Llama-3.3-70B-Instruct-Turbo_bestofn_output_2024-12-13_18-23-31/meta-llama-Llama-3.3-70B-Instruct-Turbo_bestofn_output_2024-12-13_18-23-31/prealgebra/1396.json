    "## Step 1: Convert the decimal numbers to fractions\nTo simplify the division, we first convert the decimal numbers into fractions. $0.18$ can be written as $\\frac{18}{100}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{9}{50}$. $0.003$ can be written as $\\frac{3}{1000}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{3}{1000}$.\n\n## Step 2: Perform the division of fractions\nWhen dividing by a fraction, it is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. Therefore, $\\frac{9}{50} \\div \\frac{3}{1000}$ becomes $\\frac{9}{50} \\times \\frac{1000}{3}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the multiplication of fractions\nTo multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators together to get the new numerator and multiply the denominators together to get the new denominator. Therefore, $\\frac{9}{50} \\times \\frac{1000}{3}$ becomes $\\frac{9 \\times 1000}{50 \\times 3}$.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the multiplication\nMultiplying the numerators gives $9 \\times 1000 = 9000$. Multiplying the denominators gives $50 \\times 3 = 150$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the resulting fraction\nThe resulting fraction is $\\frac{9000}{150}$. This can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 150. $\\frac{9000 \\div 150}{150 \\div 150} = \\frac{60}{1}$.\n\n## Step 6: Write the simplified fraction as a number\nSince $\\frac{60}{1}$ is equal to $60$, our final answer is a whole number.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{60}$"
