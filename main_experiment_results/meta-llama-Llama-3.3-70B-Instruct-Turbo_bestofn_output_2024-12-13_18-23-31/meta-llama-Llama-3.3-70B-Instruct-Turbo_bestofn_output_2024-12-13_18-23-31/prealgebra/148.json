    "## Step 1: Define the formula for the average of two numbers\nThe average of two numbers is defined as their sum divided by 2. In this case, the average of 23 and $x$ is given as 27. So, we can write the equation as $(23 + x) / 2 = 27$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the equation for $x$\nTo find the value of $x$, we first multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction. This gives us $23 + x = 54$.\n\n## Step 3: Isolate $x$ in the equation\nNext, we subtract 23 from both sides of the equation to solve for $x$. This yields $x = 54 - 23$, which simplifies to $x = 31$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the positive difference between 23 and $x$\nNow that we know $x = 31$, we can find the positive difference between 23 and $x$. The positive difference is $|23 - 31| = | -8 | = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
