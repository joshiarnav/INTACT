    "## Step 1: Identify the multiples of both 3 and 5 between 1 and 200.\nTo find the multiples of both 3 and 5, we need to find the multiples of their least common multiple (LCM), which is 15. So, we will list the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200.\n\n## Step 2: List the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200.\nThe multiples of 15 between 1 and 200 are: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165, 180, and 195.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the multiples of 4 among the listed numbers.\nNow, we need to identify which of these numbers are also multiples of 4, so we can exclude them. The multiples of 4 among the listed numbers are: 60, 120, and 180.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the multiples of 7 among the listed numbers.\nNext, we need to identify which of the remaining numbers are multiples of 7, so we can exclude them as well. The multiple of 7 among the listed numbers is: 105.\n\n## Step 5: Exclude the multiples of 4 and 7 from the total count of multiples of 15.\nAfter excluding the multiples of 4 (60, 120, 180) and the multiple of 7 (105), we subtract these from the total count of multiples of 15. There are 13 multiples of 15, and we exclude 4 numbers (since 105 is not a multiple of 4 but is a multiple of 7 and has been counted separately).\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final count of numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7.\nThe total count of numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7 is 13 - 4 = 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5\nTo find the integers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, we first need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5. The LCM of 3 and 5 is 15.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of multiples of 15 between 1 and 200\nNext, we need to calculate how many multiples of 15 are there between 1 and 200. We can do this by dividing 200 by 15 and taking the floor of the result, which gives us the number of whole multiples of 15 in the range. 200 / 15 = 13.333..., so the floor of this is 13.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 4\nNow, we need to identify the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 4, which means they are multiples of the LCM of 15 and 4. The LCM of 15 and 4 is 60. We calculate the number of multiples of 60 between 1 and 200 by dividing 200 by 60 and taking the floor, which gives us 200 / 60 = 3.333..., so the floor is 3.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 7\nWe also need to identify the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 7, meaning they are multiples of the LCM of 15 and 7. The LCM of 15 and 7 is 105. We calculate the number of multiples of 105 between 1 and 200 by dividing 200 by 105 and taking the floor, which gives us 200 / 105 = 1.904..., so the floor is 1.\n\n## Step 5: Check for overlap between multiples of 60 and 105\nTo ensure we're not double-counting any numbers that are multiples of both 60 and 105 (which would be multiples of their LCM, 420), we check if there are any multiples of 420 between 1 and 200. Since 420 is greater than 200, there are no multiples of 420 in this range, meaning there's no overlap to account for.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final number of multiples of 15 that are not multiples of 4 or 7\nFinally, to find the number of integers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7, we subtract the number of multiples of 60 and 105 from the total number of multiples of 15. That gives us 13 - (3 + 1) = 13 - 4 = 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",

So, 200 / 15 = 13.333, which means there are 13 multiples of 15 between 1 and 200.\n\n## Step 3: Find the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 4 between 1 and 200\nThe LCM of 15 and 4 is 60. We calculate the number of multiples of 60 between 1 and 200 by dividing 200 by 60, which gives 3.333. Thus, there are 3 multiples of 60 (and hence of 4) between 1 and 200.\n\n## Step 4: Find the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 7 between 1 and 200\nThe LCM of 15 and 7 is 105. Dividing 200 by 105 gives 1.904.

So, 13 - (3 + 1) = 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$"

  "solution": "Integers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 must be multiples of 15.  We can start by listing the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200: $$15,30,45,60,75,90,105,120,135,150,165,180,195$$ Checking only the even numbers, we can eliminate those that are multiples of 4, leaving us with: $$15,30,45,75,90,105,135,150,165,195$$ Finally, we need to eliminate any remaining multiples of 7.  The only multiples of 7 we need to be concerned with are those ending in 5 or 0.  The only number on the list that is a multiple of 7 is 105.  Our final list is: $$15,30,45,75,90,135,150,165,195$$ This leaves us with $\\boxed{9}$ integers.",
