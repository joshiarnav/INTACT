    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of slices with pepperoni.\nThere are 6 slices with pepperoni.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the total number of slices with mushrooms.\nThere are 10 slices with mushrooms.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices if we add the slices with pepperoni and mushrooms without considering overlap.\nIf we simply add the slices with pepperoni and the slices with mushrooms, we get 6 + 10 = 16 slices. However, we know there are only 12 slices in total.\n\n## Step 4: Understand the concept of overlap.\nThe difference between the total number of slices counted (16) and the actual total number of slices (12) represents the slices that were counted twice because they have both pepperoni and mushrooms.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of slices that have both pepperoni and mushrooms.\nTo find the number of slices that have both toppings, we subtract the actual total number of slices from the counted total: 16 - 12 = 4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",

  "solution": "There are 12 total slices, and 6 of them have pepperoni and 10 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number of the slices that have both toppings, so there are $6-n$ with just pepperoni and $10-n$ with just mushrooms.  Since every slice has at least one topping, and there are 12 slices, we must have $(6-n) + (10-n) + n = 12$, which gives $n=\\boxed{4}$.",
