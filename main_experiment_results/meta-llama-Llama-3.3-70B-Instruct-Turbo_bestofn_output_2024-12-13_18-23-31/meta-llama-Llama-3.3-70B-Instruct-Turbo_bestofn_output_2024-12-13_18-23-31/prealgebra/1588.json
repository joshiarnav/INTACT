    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given that the product of three different positive integers is equal to $7^3$. This means that each integer must be a factor of $7^3$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the factors of $7^3$\n$7^3 = 7 \\times 7 \\times 7 = 343$. The factors of $7^3$ are 1, 7, 49, 343.\n\n## Step 3: Find three different positive integers whose product equals $7^3$\nTo find three different positive integers whose product equals $7^3$, we can try different combinations of the factors. One possible combination is $1 \\times 7 \\times 49 = 343$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of the three integers\nNow, we calculate the sum of the three integers: $1 + 7 + 49 = 57$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks for the sum of three different positive integers whose product equals $7^3$. To start, we need to find all the different combinations of three positive integers that multiply to $7^3$.\n\n## Step 2: Factorize $7^3$\n$7^3$ can be factorized into its prime factors, which is simply $7 \\times 7 \\times 7$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the combinations of integers\nGiven that the product is $7^3$, and we need three different positive integers, the possible combinations are limited because the only prime factor is 7. The combinations could be $1, 7, 7^2$ since these are the only factors that multiply to $7^3$ and are different.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of the integers\nWe calculate the sum of $1 + 7 + 7^2$. Since $7^2 = 49$, the sum is $1 + 7 + 49$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the addition\nAdding $1 + 7 + 49$ gives us $57$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find three different positive integers whose product equals $7^3$. Since $7^3 = 7 \\times 7 \\times 7$, the only way to have three different integers is to use 1, 7, and $7^2$ (49), as these are the only factors of $7^3$ that can be combined in a different way.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the integers\nThe integers are 1, 7, and 49, as these are the factors of $7^3$ when trying to find three distinct numbers.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the sum of the integers\nTo find the sum, we add the three integers together: $1 + 7 + 49$.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the addition\n$1 + 7 + 49 = 57$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57}$"
