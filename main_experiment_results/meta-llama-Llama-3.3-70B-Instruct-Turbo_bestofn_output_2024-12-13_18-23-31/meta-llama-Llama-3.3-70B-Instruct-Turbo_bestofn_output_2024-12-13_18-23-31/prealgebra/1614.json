    "To solve this problem, let's start by expressing the number of marbles each person has in terms of $a$, the number of marbles Angela has.\n\n1. Angela has $a$ marbles.\n2. Brian has twice as many marbles as Angela, so Brian has $2a$ marbles.\n3. Caden has three times as many marbles as Brian, which means Caden has $3 \\times 2a = 6a$ marbles.\n4. Daryl has five times the number of marbles Caden has, so Daryl has $5 \\times 6a = 30a$ marbles.\n\nNow, we know that in total, Angela, Brian, Caden, and Daryl have 78 marbles. We can write an equation to represent this:\n\n\\[a + 2a + 6a + 30a = 78\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[39a = 78\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 39 to solve for $a$:\n\n\\[a = \\frac{78}{39}\\]\n\n\\[a = 2\\]\n\nSo, the value of $a$ is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

  "solution": "First, quantify the number of marbles each person has:\n\n$\\bullet$ Angela has $a$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Brian has $2\\times a$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Caden has $3\\times(2\\times a)$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Daryl has $5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))$ marbles.\n\nIn total, the four people have $a+2\\times a+3\\times(2\\times a)+5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))$ marbles. And that expression equals 78, since in total the four people have 78 marbles. Now evaluate the resulting equation. \\begin{align*}\n78&=a+2\\times a+3\\times(2\\times a)+5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))\\\\\n&=a+2a+3(2a)+5(3(2a))\\\\\n&=a+2a+6a+5(6a)\\\\\n&=a+2a+6a+30a\\\\\n&=39a \\quad\\implies\\\\\na&=\\boxed{2}.\n\\end{align*}",
