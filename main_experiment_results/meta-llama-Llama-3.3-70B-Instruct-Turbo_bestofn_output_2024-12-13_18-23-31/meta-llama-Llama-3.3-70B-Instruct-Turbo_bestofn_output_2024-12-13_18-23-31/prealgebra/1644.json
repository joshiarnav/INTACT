    "## Step 1: Identify the given information\nWe are given that $\\overline{AB}\\parallel \\overline{CD}$, and $\\angle AXE$ is $108^\\circ$ less than 3 times $\\angle CYX$. We need to find $\\angle BXY$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall relevant geometric properties\nSince $\\overline{AB}\\parallel \\overline{CD}$, we know that corresponding angles are equal. This means that $\\angle AXE = \\angle CYX$ because they are corresponding angles formed by the transversal $\\overline{XE}$ intersecting the parallel lines $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up an equation for the angles\nLet's denote $\\angle CYX$ as $y$. According to the given information, $\\angle AXE = 3y - 108^\\circ$. Since $\\angle AXE = \\angle CYX$, we can write the equation $y = 3y - 108^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for $y$\nTo find the value of $y$, we need to solve the equation $y = 3y - 108^\\circ$. Subtracting $3y$ from both sides gives us $-2y = -108^\\circ$. Dividing both sides by $-2$ yields $y = 54^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the measure of $\\angle BXY$\nSince $\\angle BXY$ and $\\angle CYX$ are vertical angles, they are equal in measure. Therefore, $\\angle BXY = \\angle CYX = 54^\\circ$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{54}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the given information\nWe are given that $\\overline{AB}\\parallel \\overline{CD}$, which implies that $\\angle CYX$ and $\\angle BXY$ are corresponding angles and thus congruent. We are also given that $\\angle AXE$ is $108^\\circ$ less than 3 times $\\angle CYX$.\n\n## Step 2: Express the relationship between $\\angle AXE$ and $\\angle CYX$\nLet's denote $\\angle CYX$ as $x$. Since $\\angle AXE$ and $\\angle CYX$ are vertical angles, they are equal in measure. Therefore, $\\angle AXE = x$. According to the problem, $\\angle AXE = 3x - 108^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation\nSince $\\angle AXE = x$ and $\\angle AXE = 3x - 108^\\circ$, we can set up the equation $x = 3x - 108^\\circ$ to find the measure of $\\angle CYX$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation\nSimplifying the equation $x = 3x - 108^\\circ$, we get $108^\\circ = 3x - x$, which simplifies to $108^\\circ = 2x$. Dividing both sides by 2, we find $x = 54^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the measure of $\\angle BXY$\nSince $\\angle CYX$ and $\\angle BXY$ are corresponding angles and thus congruent, $\\angle BXY = \\angle CYX = 54^\\circ$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{54}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the given information\nWe are given that $\\overline{AB}\\parallel \\overline{CD}$ and $\\angle AXE$ is $108^\\circ$ less than 3 times $\\angle CYX$. We need to find $\\angle BXY$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the properties of parallel lines and transversals\nWhen two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal, and alternate interior angles are equal.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the properties to the given diagram\nSince $\\overline{AB}\\parallel \\overline{CD}$, $\\angle AXE$ and $\\angle CYX$ are alternate interior angles, but we are interested in $\\angle BXY$. Notice that $\\angle BXY$ and $\\angle CYX$ are corresponding angles because they are formed by the transversal $\\overline{XY}$ intersecting the parallel lines $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$.\n\n## Step 4: Set up an equation based on the given relationship between $\\angle AXE$ and $\\angle CYX$\nLet $\\angle CYX = x$. Then $\\angle AXE = 3x - 108^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 5: Use the fact that $\\angle AXE$ and $\\angle CYX$ are vertical angles to find a relationship between $\\angle BXY$ and $\\angle CYX$\nSince $\\angle AXE$ and $\\angle CYX$ are vertical angles, and we know that $\\angle BXY$ and $\\angle CYX$ are corresponding angles (hence equal), we have $\\angle BXY = \\angle CYX = x$.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the fact that $\\angle AXE$ and $\\angle BXY$ are supplementary to solve for $x$\n$\\angle AXE + \\angle BXY = 180^\\circ$ because they form a straight line. Substituting the expressions we have: $3x - 108^\\circ + x = 180^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve the equation for $x$\n$4x - 108^\\circ = 180^\\circ$. Adding $108^\\circ$ to both sides gives $4x = 288^\\circ$. Dividing both sides by 4 gives $x = 72^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 8: Find $\\angle BXY$\nSince $\\angle BXY = x$, we have $\\angle BXY = 72^\\circ$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{72}$"

  "critique": "## Step 1: Analyzing Solution 1\nSolution 1 starts by identifying the given information and recalling relevant geometric properties. It then sets up an equation for the angles and solves for the value of $y$, which represents $\\angle CYX$. The solution correctly determines that $\\angle BXY = \\angle CYX = 54^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing Solution 2\nSolution 2 also begins with identifying the given information and expressing the relationship between $\\angle AXE$ and $\\angle CYX$. It sets up an equation and solves for $x$, which represents $\\angle CYX$. Similar to Solution 1, it finds that $\\angle BXY = \\angle CYX = 54^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing Solution 3\nSolution 3 identifies the given information and recalls properties of parallel lines and transversals. However, it incorrectly applies these properties to find the relationship between $\\angle AXE$ and $\\angle CYX$ and mistakenly treats $\\angle AXE$ and $\\angle BXY$ as supplementary, leading to an incorrect equation and solution.\n\n## Step 4: Comparing the Solutions\nBoth Solution 1 and Solution 2 correctly apply geometric principles and arrive at the same answer, $\\angle BXY = 54^\\circ$. Solution 3, however, contains errors in applying geometric properties and solving the equation, resulting in an incorrect answer.\n\n## Step 5: Selecting the Best Solution\nGiven that Solution 1 and Solution 2 are correct and Solution 3 is incorrect, either Solution 1 or Solution 2 could be considered the best. However, since the task is to return strictly the index number of the best solution and both correct solutions are equally valid, we can choose either. For consistency and following the instruction to return one index, we'll choose the first correct solution encountered.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
