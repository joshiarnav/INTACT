    "## Step 1: Identify the monthly balances from the graph\nThe monthly balances are given as $100 for January, $200 for February, $150 for March, and $150 for April.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the sum of the monthly balances\nTo find the average, we first need to calculate the sum of the monthly balances. Sum = $100 + $200 + $150 + $150 = $600.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of months\nThere are 4 months in the period shown.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the average monthly balance\nTo find the average, we divide the sum of the monthly balances by the number of months. Average = Sum / Number of months = $600 / 4 = $150.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{150}$",
