    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the year after 1994 when the sales increase was the most in terms of dollars. This means we need to find the year with the greatest difference in sales amount compared to the previous year.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the graph\nLooking at the graph, we see that each point represents the end-of-year sales amount for a particular year. The years are marked on the x-axis, and the sales amounts are marked on the y-axis. We need to examine the graph to identify the year with the largest increase in sales.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the years and sales amounts\nFrom the graph, we can see that the years marked are '94, '96, '98, '00, and '02. The sales amounts for these years can be estimated from the graph. However, to determine the year with the greatest increase, we need to look for the steepest rise in the graph from one year to the next.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the year with the greatest increase\nBy examining the graph, we notice that the line segment from '96 to '98 shows the steepest increase. This indicates that the sales amount increased the most from '96 to '98 compared to any other year.\n\n## Step 5: Specify the year\nSince we are looking for the year after 1994, and the greatest increase occurred from '96 to '98, the year we are looking for is 1998.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1998}$",
    "## Step 1: Analyzing the graph\nThe graph represents end-of-year sales amounts for each year, starting from 1994. We need to find the year after 1994 when sales increased the most in terms of dollars.\n\n## Step 2: Identifying the largest increase\nTo find the year with the largest increase in sales, we need to look for the steepest rise in the graph from one year to the next. This will indicate the year when sales increased by the most number of dollars.\n\n## Step 3: Examining the graph for the steepest rise\nLooking at the graph, we can see that there are a few notable increases, but the steepest rise appears to be between 1996 and 1998.\n\n## Step 4: Calculating the increase\nFrom the graph, we can estimate that the sales amount increased from approximately 3 units (15 million dollars) in 1996 to around 4.2 units (21 million dollars) in 1998. This represents an increase of about 1.2 units or 6 million dollars from 1996 to 1998.\n\n## Step 5: Comparing with other increases\nComparing this increase with others on the graph, we can see that there is another significant increase between 1998 and 2000. However, we need to determine if this increase is the largest.\n\n## Step 6: Checking the 1998-2000 increase\nFrom 1998 to 2000, the sales amount increased from approximately 4.2 units (21 million dollars) to about 4.8 units (24 million dollars). This represents an increase of 0.6 units or 3 million dollars.\n\n## Step 7: Identifying the year with the largest increase\nSince we are looking for the year after 1994 with the largest increase in sales, we need to identify the year that corresponds to the steepest rise on the graph.\n\n## Step 8: Selecting the correct year\nBased on our analysis, the largest increase in sales occurred between 1996 and 1998. However, the question asks for the year after 1994, so we need to select the year that corresponds to the end of this period of increase.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1998}$",

We can see the sales amounts for each year: '94, '96, '98, '00, and '02.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the sales increases\nTo find the year with the largest sales increase, we need to calculate the differences in sales amounts between consecutive years.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the sales increases\nLooking at the graph, we can estimate the sales increases:\n- From '94 to '96, the increase is approximately 1.5 to 2 units (from 3 to 4.5 or 5 units on the y-axis, but not exactly sure without precise numbers).\n- From '96 to '98, the increase is approximately 0.5 units (from 4.5 or 5 to around 5.5 units, but the exact '96 and '98 values are not provided, thus making this a rough estimate).\n- From '98 to '00, the increase is approximately 1.5 units (from around 5.5 to 7 units).\n- From '00 to '02, the decrease is apparent, so this is not the year we're looking for.\n\n## Step 6: Find the year with the largest increase\nBased on the estimated increases, the largest increase seems to be from '98 to '00, with an increase of approximately 1.5 units on the graph, which translates to the largest dollar amount increase.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1998}$"

  "solution": "The chart shows the amounts of sales at the end of each year.  Therefore we're looking for a year on the chart that has the largest difference from the previous year.    Determining the sales that increased the most number of dollars is equivalent to finding the right endpoint of the segment with the steepest slope.  From observation, we can determine that that line corresponds to the year $\\boxed{1998}$.",
