    "## Step 1: Identify the positions to be filled\nThere are three positions to be filled: president, secretary, and treasurer.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of choices for each position\nFor the position of president, there are 3 possible choices (Alice, Bob, or Carol). Once the president is chosen, there are 2 remaining choices for the position of secretary. After the secretary is chosen, there is only 1 remaining choice for the position of treasurer.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of ways to fill the positions\nTo find the total number of ways to fill the positions, we multiply the number of choices for each position together. The total number of ways is 3 (choices for president) * 2 (choices for secretary) * 1 (choice for treasurer) = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

  "solution": "In this problem we are choosing a committee, so the order in which we choose the 3 people does not matter.  We could have chosen them in any of the following orders (where A is Alice, B is Bob, and C is Carol): ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.  So each possible committee corresponds to $3! = \\boxed{6}$ possible orderings.",
