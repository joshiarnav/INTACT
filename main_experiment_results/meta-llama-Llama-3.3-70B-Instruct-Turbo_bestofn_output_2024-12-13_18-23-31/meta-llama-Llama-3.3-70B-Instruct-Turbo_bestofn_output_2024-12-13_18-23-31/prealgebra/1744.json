    "To find the value of $\\frac{~\\frac{2}{5}~}{\\frac{3}{7}}$, we need to follow the steps for dividing fractions.\n\n## Step 1: Invert the second fraction\nWhen we divide by a fraction, it's equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal of that fraction. So, $\\frac{~\\frac{2}{5}~}{\\frac{3}{7}}$ becomes $\\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{7}{3}$.\n\n## Step 2: Multiply the numerators and denominators\nNow, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together: $\\frac{2 \\times 7}{5 \\times 3}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the products\nMultiplying the numerators gives $2 \\times 7 = 14$, and multiplying the denominators gives $5 \\times 3 = 15$. So, we have $\\frac{14}{15}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{14}{15}}$",
