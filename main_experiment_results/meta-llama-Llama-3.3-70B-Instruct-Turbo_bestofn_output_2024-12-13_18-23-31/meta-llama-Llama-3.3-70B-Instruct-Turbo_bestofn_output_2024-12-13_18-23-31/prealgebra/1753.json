    "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and figure\nWe are given a right-angled triangle $EAB$, with $BE = 9$ units. Two squares, $ABCD$ and $AEFG$, are drawn on the sides $AB$ and $AE$ of the triangle. We are asked to find the sum of the areas of these two squares.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the Pythagorean theorem\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $EAB$\nLet's denote $AB$ as $a$ and $AE$ as $b$. According to the Pythagorean theorem, $a^2 + b^2 = 9^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of the areas of the two squares\nThe area of square $ABCD$ is $a^2$, and the area of square $AEFG$ is $b^2$. The sum of their areas is $a^2 + b^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the sum of the areas of the squares\nFrom Step 3, we know that $a^2 + b^2 = 9^2$. Therefore, the sum of the areas of the squares is equal to $9^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $9^2$\n$9^2 = 81$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{81}$",

    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the given figure\nThe problem provides a figure with two squares, $ABCD$ and $AEFG$, where angle $EAB$ is a right angle, and $BE=9$ units. We are tasked with finding the sum of the areas of these two squares.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the Pythagorean theorem\nTo find the areas of the squares, we first need to determine the lengths of their sides. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to the given figure\nIn the given figure, $BE$ is the hypotenuse of right-angled triangle $EAB$. Let's denote the length of side $AB$ as $x$ and the length of side $AE$ as $y$. According to the Pythagorean theorem, we have $x^2 + y^2 = 9^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Recognize that the sum of the areas of the squares is equal to the sum of the squares of their side lengths\nThe area of a square is given by the formula $Area = side^2$. Therefore, the sum of the areas of the two squares $ABCD$ and $AEFG$ is $x^2 + y^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the sum of the areas of the squares\nSubstitute $9^2$ for $x^2 + y^2$ to find the sum of the areas of the squares. $x^2 + y^2 = 9^2 = 81$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{81}$"
