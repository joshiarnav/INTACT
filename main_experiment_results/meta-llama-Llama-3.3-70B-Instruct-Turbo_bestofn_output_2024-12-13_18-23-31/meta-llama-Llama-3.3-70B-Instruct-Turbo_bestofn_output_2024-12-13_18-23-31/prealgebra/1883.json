  "problem": "In order to compute the area of a particular circle, Juan first measures the length of its diameter. The actual diameter is 20 cm, but Juan's measurement has an error of up to $20\\%$. What is the largest possible percent error, in percent, in Juan's computed area of the circle?",

    "## Step 1: Calculate the true area of the circle.\nThe true area of the circle can be calculated using the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Given the diameter is 20 cm, the radius $r$ is 10 cm. So, the true area $A_{true} = \\pi (10)^2 = 100\\pi$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the largest possible measured diameter due to error.\nThe diameter has an error of up to $20\\%$. This means the largest possible measured diameter is $20 + 0.20 \\times 20 = 20 + 4 = 24$ cm.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area based on the largest measured diameter.\nUsing the same formula for area, but with the radius based on the largest measured diameter (24 cm), the radius $r$ would be 12 cm. So, the computed area $A_{computed} = \\pi (12)^2 = 144\\pi$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the percent error in Juan's computation.\nThe percent error can be calculated using the formula $\\frac{A_{computed} - A_{true}}{A_{true}} \\times 100\\%$. Substituting the values, we get $\\frac{144\\pi - 100\\pi}{100\\pi} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{44\\pi}{100\\pi} \\times 100\\% = 44\\%$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{44}$",
