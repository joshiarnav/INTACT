    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of employees to find the median position.\nThe total number of employees is the sum of the employees in each position: 1 (President) + 5 (Vice-President) + 10 (Director) + 6 (Associate Director) + 37 (Administrative Specialist) = 59 employees.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the median position.\nSince there are 59 employees, the median salary is the salary of the 30th employee when the employees are listed in order of salary from lowest to highest.\n\n## Step 3: Order the positions by salary from lowest to highest.\nThe order is: Administrative Specialist ($23,000), Associate Director ($50,000), Director ($75,000), Vice-President ($90,000), President ($130,000).\n\n## Step 4: Determine which position the 30th employee falls into.\nThe first 37 employees are Administrative Specialists. Since 30 is less than 37, the 30th employee is an Administrative Specialist.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the median salary.\nThe median salary is the salary of the Administrative Specialist, which is $23,000.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{23000}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of employees\nTo find the median salary, we first need to determine the total number of employees. According to the table, there is 1 President, 5 Vice-Presidents, 10 Directors, 6 Associate Directors, and 37 Administrative Specialists. So, the total number of employees is 1 + 5 + 10 + 6 + 37 = 59.\n\n## Step 2: Arrange the salaries in ascending order\nSince we are looking for the median value, we need to arrange the salaries in ascending order. The salaries in ascending order are: $\\$23{,}000$ (37 times), $\\$50{,}000$ (6 times), $\\$75{,}000$ (10 times), $\\$90{,}000$ (5 times), and $\\$130{,}000$ (1 time).\n\n## Step 3: Find the middle value\nTo find the median, we need to find the middle value. Since there are 59 employees (an odd number), the middle value is the 30th value.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the median salary\nThe first 37 salaries are $\\$23{,}000$, which covers the first 37 employees. Since the 30th employee falls within this range, the median salary is $\\$23{,}000$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{23000}$",

The median is the middle value in a dataset when it is ordered from smallest to largest.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the median salary\nThe first 37 employees have a salary of $\\$23{,}000$, which covers the 1st to 37th positions. Since the 30th position falls within the first 37 employees, the median salary is $\\$23{,}000$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{23000}$"
