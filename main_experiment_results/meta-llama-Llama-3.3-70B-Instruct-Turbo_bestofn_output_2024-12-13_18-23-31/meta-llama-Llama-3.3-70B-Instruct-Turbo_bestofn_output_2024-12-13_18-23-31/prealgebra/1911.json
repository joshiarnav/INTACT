    "## Step 1: Identify the possible side lengths of the equilateral triangles.\nTo find equilateral triangles with all three vertices in the lattice, we first need to identify the possible side lengths of these triangles. Given that each point in the lattice is one unit from its nearest neighbor, the side lengths can be 1 or $\\sqrt{3}$ units, as these are the distances between adjacent and non-adjacent vertices of the hexagon, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Count the equilateral triangles with a side length of 1 unit.\nFor equilateral triangles with a side length of 1 unit, we can visually identify six such triangles: 176, 172, 273, 657, 574, and 473, where the numbers represent the vertices of the triangle in a clockwise direction.\n\n## Step 3: Count the equilateral triangles with a side length of $\\sqrt{3}$ units.\nFor equilateral triangles with a side length of $\\sqrt{3}$ units, there are two such triangles: 135 and 246, where the numbers represent the vertices of the triangle in a clockwise direction.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of equilateral triangles.\nNow, we can calculate the total number of equilateral triangles by adding the counts from steps 2 and 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",

    "## Step 1: To find the number of equilateral triangles with all three vertices in the lattice, we first need to understand the properties of an equilateral triangle.\nAn equilateral triangle has all three sides of equal length and all three angles are 60 degrees. Given that each point in the hexagonal lattice is one unit from its nearest neighbor, we can identify the possible equilateral triangles by looking at the distances and angles between the points.\n\n## Step 2: Let's start by identifying the equilateral triangles with side length one.\nBy examining the lattice, we can see that there are six such equilateral triangles: 176, 172, 273, 657, 574, and 473.\n\n## Step 3: Next, we need to consider the possibility of equilateral triangles with side length $\\sqrt{3}$.\nUpon inspection, we find two equilateral triangles with side length $\\sqrt{3}$: 135 and 246.\n\n## Step 4: Now, we add up the total number of equilateral triangles found in the previous steps to get the overall count.\nWe found 6 equilateral triangles with side length one and 2 equilateral triangles with side length $\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of equilateral triangles.\nTotal number of equilateral triangles = 6 (side length one) + 2 (side length $\\sqrt{3}$) = 8.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
