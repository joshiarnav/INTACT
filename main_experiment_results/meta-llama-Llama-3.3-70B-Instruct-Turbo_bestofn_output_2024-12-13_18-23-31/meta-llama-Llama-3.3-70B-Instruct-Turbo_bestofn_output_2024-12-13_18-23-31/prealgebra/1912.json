    "## Step 1: Define the arithmetic mean\nThe arithmetic mean of a set of numbers is their sum divided by the count of numbers. In this case, we have five expressions, so we will sum these expressions and divide by 5 to find the mean.\n\n## Step 2: Sum the given expressions\nThe sum of the expressions $x + 8$, $15$, $2x$, $13$, and $2x + 4$ is $(x + 8) + 15 + 2x + 13 + (2x + 4)$. Simplifying this gives $x + 8 + 15 + 2x + 13 + 2x + 4 = 5x + 40$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the arithmetic mean\nWe know the arithmetic mean of these expressions is 24. Therefore, $\\frac{5x + 40}{5} = 24$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for $x$\nTo solve for $x$, we first multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to get $5x + 40 = 120$. Then, we subtract 40 from both sides to get $5x = 80$. Finally, we divide both sides by 5 to find $x = 16$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$",
    "## Step 1: The arithmetic mean is calculated by summing all the values and then dividing by the number of values.\nTo find the arithmetic mean of the given expressions, we need to sum all the expressions and divide by the total number of expressions, which is 5.\n\n## Step 2: Sum all the given expressions.\nThe sum of the expressions is $(x + 8) + 15 + 2x + 13 + (2x + 4)$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the sum of the expressions.\nCombining like terms, the sum simplifies to $x + 8 + 15 + 2x + 13 + 2x + 4 = 5x + 40$.\n\n## Step 4: Set up the equation for the arithmetic mean.\nThe arithmetic mean of the expressions is given as 24. Therefore, the equation becomes $\\frac{5x + 40}{5} = 24$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the equation for $x$.\nMultiplying both sides by 5 gives $5x + 40 = 120$.

  "solution": "Since the arithmetic mean of these expressions is 24, we can write the expression for the mean: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{(x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)}{5}&=24\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad (x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)&=5\\cdot 24\n\\end{align*}\n\nCombining like terms on the left, we find $5x+40=120$, so $5x=80$, from which we have $x=16$. Our final answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",
