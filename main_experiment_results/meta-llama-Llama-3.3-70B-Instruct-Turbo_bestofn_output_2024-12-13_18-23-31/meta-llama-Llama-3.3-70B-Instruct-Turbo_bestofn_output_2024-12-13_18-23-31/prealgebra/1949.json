    "## Step 1: Understand what the problem is asking for.\nThe problem is asking for the smallest positive number that satisfies two conditions: it must be a prime number and it must be 10 less than a perfect square.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the conditions for the number we are looking for.\nThe number must be prime, meaning it has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. Additionally, it must be 10 less than a perfect square.\n\n## Step 3: Start checking perfect squares and subtract 10 from them to see if any are prime.\nBegin with the smallest perfect squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, etc., and subtract 10 from each to check if the resulting number is prime.\n\n## Step 4: Check the first few perfect squares minus 10 for primality.\n- For the perfect square 1: $1 - 10 = -9$, which is not positive, so we ignore it.\n- For the perfect square 4: $4 - 10 = -6$, which is not positive, so we ignore it.\n- For the perfect square 9: $9 - 10 = -1$, which is not positive, so we ignore it.\n- For the perfect square 16: $16 - 10 = 6$, which is not prime.\n- For the perfect square 25: $25 - 10 = 15$, which is not prime.\n- For the perfect square 36: $36 - 10 = 26$, which is not prime.\n- For the perfect square 49: $49 - 10 = 39$, which is not prime.\n- For the perfect square 64: $64 - 10 = 54$, which is not prime.\n- For the perfect square 81: $81 - 10 = 71$, which is prime.\n\n## Step 5: Determine if 71 meets all the criteria.\n71 is indeed a perfect square minus 10 (from 81), and it is prime. Since we are looking for the smallest such number and we started checking from the smallest perfect squares, 71 is the smallest positive number that meets both criteria.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{71}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand what the problem is asking\nWe need to find the smallest positive number that satisfies two conditions: it must be prime, and it must be $10$ less than a perfect square.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the conditions for the number\nThe number must be of the form $n^2 - 10$, where $n$ is a positive integer, and it must be a prime number.\n\n## Step 3: Start checking with the smallest possible values of n\n Begin with $n = 1$ and increase $n$ until we find a prime number that satisfies the condition.\n\n## Step 4: Check n = 1\nFor $n = 1$, $n^2 - 10 = 1^2 - 10 = 1 - 10 = -9$. This is not a positive number, so $n = 1$ does not satisfy the condition.\n\n## Step 5: Check n = 2\nFor $n = 2$, $n^2 - 10 = 2^2 - 10 = 4 - 10 = -6$. This is also not a positive number, so $n = 2$ does not satisfy the condition.\n\n## Step 6: Check n = 3\nFor $n = 3$, $n^2 - 10 = 3^2 - 10 = 9 - 10 = -1$. Still not a positive number, so $n = 3$ does not satisfy the condition.\n\n## Step 7: Check n = 4\nFor $n = 4$, $n^2 - 10 = 4^2 - 10 = 16 - 10 = 6$. This is a positive number but not a prime number, so $n = 4$ does not satisfy the condition.\n\n## Step 8: Check n = 5\nFor $n = 5$, $n^2 - 10 = 5^2 - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15$. This is a positive number but not a prime number, so $n = 5$ does not satisfy the condition.\n\n## Step 9: Check n = 6\nFor $n = 6$, $n^2 - 10 = 6^2 - 10 = 36 - 10 = 26$. This is a positive number but not a prime number, so $n = 6$ does not satisfy the condition.\n\n## Step 10: Check n = 7\nFor $n = 7$, $n^2 - 10 = 7^2 - 10 = 49 - 10 = 39$. This is a positive number but not a prime number, so $n = 7$ does not satisfy the condition.\n\n## Step 11: Check n = 8\nFor $n = 8$, $n^2 - 10 = 8^2 - 10 = 64 - 10 = 54$. This is a positive number but not a prime number, so $n = 8$ does not satisfy the condition.\n\n## Step 12: Check n = 9\nFor $n = 9$, $n^2 - 10 = 9^2 - 10 = 81 - 10 = 71$. This is a positive prime number, so $n = 9$ satisfies the condition.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{71}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand what the problem is asking for\nThe problem requires finding the smallest positive number that is both prime and 10 less than a perfect square. This means we are looking for a number that can be expressed as $n^2 - 10$, where $n$ is an integer, and this number must also be a prime number.\n\n## Step 2: Start with the smallest possible perfect squares and check if they meet the criteria\nWe start by checking the smallest perfect squares: $1^2 = 1$, $2^2 = 4$, $3^2 = 9$, $4^2 = 16$, $5^2 = 25$, and so on. We then subtract 10 from each of these perfect squares to see if any of the resulting numbers are prime.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate $1^2 - 10$\n$1^2 - 10 = 1 - 10 = -9$. This is not a positive number, so it does not meet the criteria.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate $2^2 - 10$\n$2^2 - 10 = 4 - 10 = -6$. This is also not a positive number, so it does not meet the criteria.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate $3^2 - 10$\n$3^2 - 10 = 9 - 10 = -1$. This is not a positive number, so it does not meet the criteria.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate $4^2 - 10$\n$4^2 - 10 = 16 - 10 = 6$. This is a positive number but it is not prime, so it does not meet the criteria.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate $5^2 - 10$\n$5^2 - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15$. This is a positive number but it is not prime, so it does not meet the criteria.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate $6^2 - 10$\n$6^2 - 10 = 36 - 10 = 26$. This is a positive number but it is not prime, so it does not meet the criteria.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate $7^2 - 10$\n$7^2 - 10 = 49 - 10 = 39$. This is a positive number but it is not prime, so it does not meet the criteria.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate $8^2 - 10$\n$8^2 - 10 = 64 - 10 = 54$. This is a positive number but it is not prime, so it does not meet the criteria.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate $9^2 - 10$\n$9^2 - 10 = 81 - 10 = 71$. This is a positive number and it is prime, so it meets the criteria.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{71}$"
