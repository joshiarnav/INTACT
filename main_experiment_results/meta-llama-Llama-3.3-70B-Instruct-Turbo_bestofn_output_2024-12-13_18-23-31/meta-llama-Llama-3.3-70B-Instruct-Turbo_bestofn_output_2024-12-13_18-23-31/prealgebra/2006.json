    "## Step 1: Factorize the number under the square root sign\nTo simplify $\\sqrt{245}$, first, we need to factorize 245 into its prime factors.\n\n## Step 2: Prime factorization of 245\nPrime factorization of 245 is $5 \\times 7 \\times 7$.\n\n## Step 3: Group the prime factors in pairs\nFrom the prime factorization, we have $245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7$. We can group the two 7s together as they are in pairs.\n\n## Step 4: Take the square root of the paired factors\nTaking the square root of the paired 7s gives us $\\sqrt{245} = \\sqrt{5 \\times 7^2} = 7\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7\\sqrt{5}}$",
    "## Step 1: Factor 245 into its prime factors to simplify the square root.\nFirst, we need to find the prime factors of 245. We start by dividing 245 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, but since 245 is odd, we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3. However, 245 is not divisible by 3. Moving on to 5, we find that 245 \u00f7 5 = 49. Then, we look at 49, which is 7^2. So, we can express 245 as 5 * 7^2.\n\n## Step 2: Take the square root of the prime factorization.\nNow that we have the prime factorization of 245 as 5 * 7^2!], we can take the square root. The square root of 5 remains as \u221a5 because 5 is not a perfect square. The square root of 7^2 is simply 7, because the square root and the square cancel each other out.\n\n## Step 3: Combine the results of the square root of each prime factor.\nSo, we have \u221a245 = \u221a(5 * 7^2) = \u221a5 * \u221a7^2 = \u221a5 * 7 = 7\u221a5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7\\sqrt{5}}$",

This involves factorizing 245 into its prime factors.\n\n## Step 2: Find the prime factors of 245\nBreaking down 245 into its prime factors: $245 = 5 \\times 49$. Noticing that 49 is a perfect square ($49 = 7^2$), we can rewrite $\\sqrt{245}$ as $\\sqrt{5 \\times 7^2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the square root\nUsing the property of square roots that $\\sqrt{a \\times b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b}$, we can simplify $\\sqrt{5 \\times 7^2}$ to $\\sqrt{5} \\times \\sqrt{7^2}$. Since $\\sqrt{7^2} = 7$, the expression simplifies to $7\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7\\sqrt{5}}$"

  "solution": "We check what squares divide 245. None of the squares from $2^2$ to $6^2$ divides 245, but $7^2=49$ does. Dividing 245 by 49 gives 5, which has no square factors. So, $\\sqrt{245}=\\sqrt{49\\cdot5}=\\boxed{7\\sqrt{5}}$.",
