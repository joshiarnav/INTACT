    "## Step 1: Let's denote the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order as x.\nWe know that the manager places 20% of them on the shelves, which means 80% of the Mr. Slinkums are left in storage.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of Mr. Slinkums left in storage in terms of x.\nSince 80% of the Mr. Slinkums are left in storage, this can be represented as 0.8x = 120.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the equation 0.8x = 120 for x.\nDivide both sides of the equation by 0.8 to find x: x = 120 / 0.8.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the division to find the value of x.\nx = 150.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{150}$",

  "solution": "If $20\\%$ of the toys were put on the shelves, the $80\\%$ of the toys were left in storage.  Therefore, we are given $80\\% T=120$, where $T$ is the number of toys in the order.  Rewriting $80\\%$ as $\\frac{4}{5}$ and multiplying both sides by $\\frac{5}{4}$, we find that $T=120\\cdot\\frac{5}{4}=30\\cdot 5=\\boxed{150}$.",
