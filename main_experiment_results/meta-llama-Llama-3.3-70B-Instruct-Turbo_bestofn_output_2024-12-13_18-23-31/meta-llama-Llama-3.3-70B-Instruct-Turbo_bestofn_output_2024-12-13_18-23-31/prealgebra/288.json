    "## Step 1: Identify the one-digit primes\nOne-digit primes are 2, 3, 5, 7. Among these, the two largest are 5 and 7.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the two-digit primes\nTwo-digit primes range from 11 to 97. The largest two-digit prime is 97.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the product of the identified primes\nTo find the product, we multiply the two largest one-digit primes (5 and 7) by the largest two-digit prime (97). So, the calculation is 5 * 7 * 97.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the multiplication\n5 * 7 = 35, then 35 * 97 = 3395.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3395}$",
