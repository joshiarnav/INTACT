    "## Step 1: First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).\nWe will start by performing the division operation: $6 \\div 3 = 2$.\n\n## Step 2: Next, we perform the multiplication operation.\n$2 \\cdot 8 = 16$.\n\n## Step 3: Now, we substitute the results of the division and multiplication back into the original equation and perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.\n$2 - 2 - 8 + 16$.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.\nFirst, $2 - 2 = 0$.\nThen, $0 - 8 = -8$.\nFinally, $-8 + 16 = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",

    "## Step 1: Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which means we first perform division and multiplication before addition and subtraction.\nWe start with the expression $6 \\div 3 - 2 - 8 + 2 \\cdot 8$.

So, $6 \\div 3 = 2$ and $2 \\cdot 8 = 16$.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the results of the division and multiplication back into the expression.\nAfter performing the division and multiplication, the expression becomes $2 - 2 - 8 + 16$.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right.\nNow, we perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.

  "solution": "Recall that multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction. We get \\[\n6 \\div 3 - 2 - 8 + 2 \\cdot 8 = 2 - 2 - 8 + 16.\n\\]We rewrite the subtractions as additions of negations so we can rearrange:  \\begin{align*}\n2 - 2 - 8 + 16 &= 2 + (-2) + (-8) + 16 \\\\\n&= 16 + 2 + (-2) + (-8) \\\\\n&= 18 - (2+8) \\\\\n&= 18-10 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{8}.\n\\end{align*}",
