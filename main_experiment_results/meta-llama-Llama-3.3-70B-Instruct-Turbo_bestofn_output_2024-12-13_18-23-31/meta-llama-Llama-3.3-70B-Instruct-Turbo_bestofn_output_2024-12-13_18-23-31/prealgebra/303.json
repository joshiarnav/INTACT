    "## Step 1: First, we need to find the decimal equivalents of the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nTo do this, we'll divide the numerator by the denominator for each fraction. For $\\frac{1}{7}$, the decimal equivalent is approximately 0.142857 (repeating), and for $\\frac{1}{3}$, it is approximately 0.333333 (repeating).\n\n## Step 2: Next, we need to sum these decimal equivalents to find the combined decimal.\nAdding 0.142857 (repeating) and 0.333333 (repeating) gives us a sum of 0.476190 (repeating).\n\n## Step 3: Now, we need to identify the repeating pattern in the sum to determine the 20th digit after the decimal point.\nThe repeating pattern in the sum of the decimals is 476190. This sequence has 6 digits.\n\n## Step 4: To find the 20th digit, we need to see where it falls within the repeating pattern.\nSince the pattern repeats every 6 digits, we divide 20 by 6 to see how many complete cycles there are before reaching the 20th digit. 20 divided by 6 gives us 3 with a remainder of 2. This means the pattern repeats 3 times (18 digits), and the 20th digit will be the 2nd digit in the repeating pattern.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the 2nd digit in the repeating pattern 476190.\nThe 2nd digit in the pattern is 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
    "## Step 1: Convert the fractions to decimal equivalents\nTo find the decimal equivalents, we divide the numerator by the denominator for each fraction. The decimal equivalent of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is approximately $0.142857$, and it repeats every 6 digits. The decimal equivalent of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $0.333333...$, where the 3 repeats infinitely.\n\n## Step 2: Sum the decimal equivalents\nNow, we sum the decimal equivalents of $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The sum is $0.142857 + 0.333333... = 0.476190...$. We notice that after the first digit, the pattern of $\\frac{1}{7}$ (142857) continues, but it is added to the repeating 3 of $\\frac{1}{3}$. To find the 20th digit after the decimal point, we need to consider how the repeating patterns of both decimals interact.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the repeating pattern in the sum\nThe repeating block for $\\frac{1}{7}$ is 142857, which has 6 digits. The repeating block for $\\frac{1}{3}$ is 3, which has 1 digit. When we add these together, we get a pattern, but to find the 20th digit, we need to see how many complete cycles of the 6-digit block from $\\frac{1}{7}$ occur and where we are in the pattern after 20 digits.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the position within the repeating pattern\nSince the pattern from $\\frac{1}{7}$ repeats every 6 digits, we divide 20 by 6 to see how many complete cycles of the pattern occur before reaching the 20th digit. 20 divided by 6 gives 3 with a remainder of 2. This means that the pattern repeats 3 times (18 digits), and we are looking for the 2nd digit in the next repetition of the pattern.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the 20th digit\nThe repeating block from $\\frac{1}{7}$ is 142857. When added to the repeating 3 from $\\frac{1}{3}$, the block becomes 475960. Since we are looking for the 2nd digit in this repeating block (after 3 complete cycles), we find that the 2nd digit in the pattern 475960 is 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
    "## Step 1: Convert the fractions to their decimal equivalents\nTo find the decimal equivalents, we divide the numerator by the denominator for each fraction. For $\\frac{1}{7}$, the decimal equivalent is approximately $0.142857$. For $\\frac{1}{3}$, the decimal equivalent is $0.333333$. We notice that $\\frac{1}{7}$ has a repeating cycle of 6 digits (142857), and $\\frac{1}{3}$ has a repeating cycle of 1 digit (3).\n\n## Step 2: Sum the decimal equivalents\nNow, we sum these decimal equivalents: $0.142857 + 0.333333 = 0.476190$. However, since both fractions have repeating decimals, we should consider how their cycles interact. The repeating cycle of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is 6 digits long, and the repeating cycle of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is 1 digit long.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the repeating pattern of the sum\nWhen adding these decimals, the repeating pattern of the sum will be influenced by the longer cycle, which is 6 digits from $\\frac{1}{7}$. The repeating pattern of $\\frac{1}{3}$ (which is just 3) will fit into this 6-digit cycle. To find the repeating pattern of the sum, we perform the addition considering the repeating cycles: $0.142857 + 0.333333 = 0.476190$. Since $\\frac{1}{7}$'s cycle is 6 digits and $\\frac{1}{3}$'s cycle is 1 digit, the sum's cycle will be 6 digits long because 6 is the least common multiple of 6 and 1.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the repeating cycle of the sum\nPerforming the addition for the first 6 digits after the decimal point, we get $0.476190$. This sequence of 6 digits will repeat because of the nature of the repeating decimals of $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the 20th digit after the decimal point\nSince the repeating cycle of the sum is 6 digits long, we need to find where the 20th digit falls within this cycle. We divide 20 by 6 and find that it goes in 3 times with a remainder of 2. This means the cycle repeats 3 times, and the 20th digit will be the 2nd digit in the repeating cycle.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the 2nd digit in the repeating cycle\nThe repeating cycle is $476190$. The 2nd digit in this cycle is $7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"

  "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$, and that of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $0.\\overline{3}$. The first has a repeating block of 6 digits and the second has a repeating block of 1 digit, so we believe the repeating block of the sum will have 6 digits and try adding the first 6 digits of each decimal representation.  $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}& & &. &1 & 4 & \\stackrel{1}{2} & 8 & \\stackrel{1}{5} & 7\\\\& +& &. &3 &3 & 3 & 3& 3 & 3\\\\ \\cline{1-9} & & & .& 4 &7 & 6 & 1 & 9 & 0\\\\ \\end{array} $$ Notice that continuing the addition past the first six digits will result in repeating blocks of the same six digits ($.142857+.333333=.476190$), so the decimal representation of the sum is $0.\\overline{476190}$. Since 20 divided by 6 has a remainder of 2, the 20th digit following the decimal point is the same as the second digit following the decimal point, which is $\\boxed{7}$.",
