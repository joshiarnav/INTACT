    "## Step 1: Define the probabilities of earning grades A, B, and C.\nLet's denote the probability of earning an A as P(A), the probability of earning a B as P(B), and the probability of earning a C as P(C). According to the problem, P(A) = 0.7 * P(B) and P(C) = 1.4 * P(B).\n\n## Step 2: Establish the relationship between the probabilities of A, B, and C.\nSince all grades are A, B, or C, the sum of the probabilities of earning each grade equals 1. Therefore, P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the expressions for P(A) and P(C) in terms of P(B) into the equation from Step 2.\nSubstituting P(A) = 0.7 * P(B) and P(C) = 1.4 * P(B) into the equation gives 0.7 * P(B) + P(B) + 1.4 * P(B) = 1.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for P(B).\nCombining like terms, we get 3.1 * P(B) = 1. Then, solving for P(B) gives P(B) = 1 / 3.1.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate P(B) as a decimal.\nP(B) = 1 / 3.1 \u2248 0.3226.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the expected number of B's in a class of 31 students.\nThe expected number of B's is the probability of earning a B multiplied by the total number of students. So, the expected number of B's = P(B) * 31.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the expected number of B's.\nExpected number of B's \u2248 0.3226 * 31 \u2248 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",

    "## Step 1: Define the relationship between the probabilities of earning grades A, B, and C.\nLet's denote the probability of earning a B as P(B). Given that the probability of earning an A is 0.7 times the probability of earning a B, we have P(A) = 0.7P(B). Also, the probability of earning a C is 1.4 times the probability of earning a B, so P(C) = 1.4P(B).\n\n## Step 2: Establish the equation based on the fact that the sum of all probabilities equals 1.\nSince all grades are A, B, or C, the sum of their probabilities must equal 1. Therefore, P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1.

  "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of students who earn a B. Then we know that the number of students who get an A is $.7x$ and the number of students who earn a C is $1.4x$. Since every student in the class gets an A, B, or C and there are 31 students, this gives us the equation $.7x + x + 1.4x = 31 \\Rightarrow 3.1x = 31 \\Rightarrow x =\\boxed{10}$.",
