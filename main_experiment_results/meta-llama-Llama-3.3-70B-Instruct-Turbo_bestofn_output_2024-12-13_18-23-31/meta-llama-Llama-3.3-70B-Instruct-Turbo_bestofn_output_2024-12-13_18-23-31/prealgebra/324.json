    "## Step 1: Calculate the total percentage of sales for pens and pencils\nThe total percentage of sales for pens and pencils is 38% + 35% = 73%.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the percentage of sales that were not pens or pencils\nSince the total percentage of sales must be 100%, the percentage of sales that were not pens or pencils can be found by subtracting the total percentage of sales for pens and pencils from 100%. So, 100% - 73% = 27%.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",
    "## Step 1: Calculate the total percentage of pens and pencils sales\nThe total percentage of pens and pencils sales is 38 + 35 = 73%.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the percentage of other sales\nSince the total percentage of sales must be 100%, we subtract the percentage of pens and pencils sales from 100% to find the percentage of other sales. So, the percentage of other sales is 100 - 73 = 27%.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",
