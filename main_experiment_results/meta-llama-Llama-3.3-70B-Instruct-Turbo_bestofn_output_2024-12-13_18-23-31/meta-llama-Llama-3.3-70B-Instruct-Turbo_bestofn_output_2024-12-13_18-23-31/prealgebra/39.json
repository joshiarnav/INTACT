    "## Step 1: Recall the sum of interior angles of a pentagon\nThe sum of the interior angles of any pentagon is given by the formula $(n-2) \\times 180^\\circ$, where $n$ is the number of sides. For a pentagon, $n = 5$, so the sum of the interior angles is $(5-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 3 \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the given angle relationships\nWe are given that $\\angle M \\cong \\angle T \\cong \\angle H$, which means these three angles are equal in measure. Let's denote the measure of each of these angles as $x^\\circ$. We are also told that $\\angle A$ is supplementary to $\\angle S$, meaning that $\\angle A + \\angle S = 180^\\circ$. Let's denote the measure of $\\angle A$ as $y^\\circ$ and the measure of $\\angle S$ as $z^\\circ$, with the relationship $y + z = 180$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the sum of interior angles\nGiven that the sum of all interior angles of the pentagon is $540^\\circ$, and knowing the relationships between the angles, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[x + y + x + z + x = 540\\]\nSince $y + z = 180$, we can simplify the equation by substituting $180$ for $y + z$:\n\\[x + 180 + x = 540\\]\n\\[3x + 180 = 540\\]\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $x$\nTo find the measure of $\\angle H$, which is equal to $x$, we solve the equation:\n\\[3x + 180 = 540\\]\nSubtract $180$ from both sides:\n\\[3x = 360\\]\nDivide both sides by $3$:\n\\[x = 120\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{120}$",
    "## Step 1: Recall the sum of interior angles in a pentagon\nThe sum of interior angles in a pentagon is given by the formula $180^\\circ(n-2)$, where $n$ is the number of sides of the polygon.

Since $\\angle M$, $\\angle T$, and $\\angle H$ each measure $x^\\circ$, and $\\angle A + \\angle S = 180^\\circ$, we can express the sum of all angles as $x + 180^\\circ + x + x = 540^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $x$\nSimplifying the equation from Step 3: $3x + 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ$.

Therefore, $\\angle M = \\angle T = \\angle H = x$.\n\n## Step 3: Understand the relationship between $\\angle A$ and $\\angle S$\nIt is given that $\\angle A$ is supplementary to $\\angle S$. This means that the sum of $\\angle A$ and $\\angle S$ is $180^\\circ$.

Since $a + s = 180^\\circ$, we can simplify this to $3x + 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $x$, the measure of $\\angle H$\nTo find the measure of $\\angle H$, which is $x$, we solve the equation $3x + 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ$. Subtracting $180^\\circ$ from both sides gives $3x = 360^\\circ$. Dividing both sides by $3$ gives $x = 120^\\circ$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{120}$"
