    "## Step 1: Identify the formula for the area of a circle\nThe formula for the area of a circle is $A = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the radius of the circle\nGiven the diameter of the circle is 4 meters, the radius is half of the diameter. Therefore, the radius $r$ is $4 / 2 = 2$ meters.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area of the circle\nSubstitute the radius into the area formula: $A = \\pi (2)^2 = \\pi \\times 4 = 4\\pi$ square meters.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4\\pi}$",
