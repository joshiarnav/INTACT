    "## Step 1: Determine the distance between each city\nTo calculate the total distance Piravena travels, we first need to find the distance between each city. Given that $A$ is 3000 km away from $C$ and $B$ is 3250 km away from $A$, and the cities form a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between $B$ and $C$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between B and C\nLet $BC$ be the distance between $B$ and $C$. Using the Pythagorean theorem: $AB^2 = BC^2 + AC^2$. Substituting the given values: $3250^2 = BC^2 + 3000^2$. Solving for $BC$: $BC^2 = 3250^2 - 3000^2$. Therefore, $BC^2 = 10562500 - 9000000 = 1562500$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $BC = \\sqrt{1562500} = 1250$ km.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled\nThe total distance traveled by Piravena is the sum of the distances between $A$ and $B$, $B$ and $C$, and $C$ and $A$. This equals $AB + BC + AC = 3250 + 1250 + 3000$.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the addition to get the total distance\nAdding the distances together: $3250 + 1250 + 3000 = 7500$ km.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7500}$",

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Here, $AB$ is the hypotenuse, so $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2$. We know $AB = 3250$ km and $AC = 3000$ km. Thus, $3250^2 = 3000^2 + BC^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate $BC^2$\n$3250^2 = 3000^2 + BC^2$ implies $BC^2 = 3250^2 - 3000^2$. Calculating these values: $3250^2 = 10562500$ and $3000^2 = 9000000$.

    "## Step 1: Determine the distances between each city\nGiven the right-angled triangle formed by cities $A$, $B$, and $C$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between $B$ and $C$. The distances between $A$ and $C$ and between $A$ and $B$ are already provided as 3000 km and 3250 km, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean theorem\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that for any right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Thus, for our triangle with $AB$ as the hypotenuse, $BC^2 + AC^2 = AB^2$. However, since $AB$ is the hypotenuse and its length is given, we actually need to find $BC$, so we rearrange the formula to solve for $BC$: $BC^2 = AB^2 - AC^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the distance BC\nSubstitute the given values into the rearranged formula: $BC^2 = 3250^2 - 3000^2$.\nThen, calculate the values: $BC^2 = 10562500 - 9000000$.\nThis simplifies to: $BC^2 = 1562500$.\nTaking the square root of both sides gives: $BC = \\sqrt{1562500} = 1250$ km.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the total distance traveled\nThe total distance Piravena travels is the sum of the distances between $A$ and $B$, $B$ and $C$, and $C$ and $A$.
