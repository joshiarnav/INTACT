    "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and what needs to be calculated.\nVanessa wants to buy a ribbon that is 2 inches longer than the circumference of a circular sign. The area of the circular sign is given as 154 square inches, and Vanessa estimates $\\pi$ as $\\frac{22}{7}$. We need to calculate the length of the ribbon she needs to buy.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the radius of the circular sign using the given area.\nThe formula for the area of a circle is $A = \\pi r^2$, where $A$ is the area and $r$ is the radius. Given that the area $A$ is 154 square inches and $\\pi$ is estimated as $\\frac{22}{7}$, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the radius $r$. So, $154 = \\frac{22}{7}r^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for the radius $r$.\nTo find $r$, we first multiply both sides of the equation by $\\frac{7}{22}$ to isolate $r^2$. This gives $r^2 = 154 \\times \\frac{7}{22} = 49$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $r = 7$ inches.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the circumference of the circular sign.\nThe formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = 2\\pi r$. Using the estimated value of $\\pi = \\frac{22}{7}$ and the radius $r = 7$ inches, we substitute these into the formula to find the circumference. So, $C = 2 \\times \\frac{22}{7} \\times 7 = 44$ inches.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the length of the ribbon needed.\nVanessa wants to buy a ribbon that is 2 inches longer than the circumference of the circle. Therefore, we add 2 inches to the circumference to find the length of the ribbon she needs. So, the length of the ribbon $= 44 + 2 = 46$ inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{46}$",

  "solution": "Say the radius of the circle is $r$. Then the area of the circle is $\\pi r^2,$ which we estimate to $154=\\frac{22}{7}r^2$. If we multiply both sides by $\\frac{7}{22}$, we get $r^2=49$ or $r=7$. The circle's circumference is $2\\pi r$, which we again estimate to $\\frac{44}{7}r=44$.
