    "## Step 1: Translate the problem into mathematical expressions\nWe need to translate the given problem into mathematical expressions. The problem states that one-half of one-seventh of $T$ equals one-third of one-fifth of 90. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{7} \\times T = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{5} \\times 90$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation\nNow, let's simplify both sides of the equation:\n$\\frac{1}{14}T = \\frac{1}{15} \\times 90$.\n\n## Step 3: Further simplify the right side of the equation\nSimplifying the right side gives:\n$\\frac{1}{14}T = 6$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for T\nTo solve for $T$, we multiply both sides of the equation by 14 to isolate $T$:\n!$T = 6 \\times 14$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the value of T\nPerforming the multiplication gives:\n$T = 84$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{84}$",
