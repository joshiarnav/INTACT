    "To find the probability of a blue face facing up when the cube is rolled, we need to consider the total number of faces and the number of blue faces.\n\n1. A standard cube has 6 faces in total.\n2. Our cube has 4 blue faces and 2 red faces, making a total of 6 faces as well.\n3. The probability of an event happening is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (in this case, a blue face facing up) by the total number of possible outcomes (total faces of the cube).\n4. Therefore, the probability of a blue face facing up is the number of blue faces (4) divided by the total number of faces (6).\n\nSo, the probability = 4/6 = 2/3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$",

    "To find the probability that a blue face will be facing up when the cube is rolled, we need to know the total number of faces and the number of blue faces.\n\n1. A standard cube has 6 faces in total.\n2. This particular cube has 4 blue faces and 2 red faces, making a total of 6 faces as well.\n\nThe probability of an event happening is calculated by dividing the number of ways the event can occur by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the event is a blue face facing up.\n\nNumber of ways a blue face can face up = Number of blue faces = 4\nTotal number of possible outcomes = Total number of faces = 6\n\nProbability = Number of blue faces / Total number of faces = 4/6\n\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.\n\nProbability = 4/6 = 2/3\n\nSo, the probability that when the cube is rolled, a blue face will be facing up is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$."

  "solution": "We have 6 equally likely outcomes, corresponding to the 6 faces of the cube.  4 of those 6 outcomes are successful ones (meaning a blue face is facing up).  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
