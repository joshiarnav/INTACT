  "problem": "A zoo has a menagerie containing four pairs of different animals, one male and one female for each. The zookeeper wishes to feed the animals in a specific pattern: each time he feeds a single animal, the next one he feeds must be a different gender. If he starts by feeding the male giraffe, how many ways can he feed all the animals?",

    "## Step 1: Determine the total number of animals and their genders.\nThere are 4 pairs of different animals, meaning there are 4 males and 4 females, totaling 8 animals.\n\n## Step 2: Establish the feeding pattern constraint.\nThe zookeeper must alternate between feeding a male and a female. Since he starts with a male, the pattern will be male-female-male-female and so on, until all animals are fed.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of options at each step of the feeding process.\n1. The first animal to be fed is already chosen (the male giraffe), so there's 1 way to choose the first animal.\n2. For the first female, there are 4 females to choose from.\n3. For the second male, there are 3 males left to choose from.\n4. For the second female, there are 3 females left to choose from.\n5. For the third male, there are 2 males left to choose from.\n6. For the third female, there are 2 females left to choose from.\n7. For the fourth male, there is 1 male left to choose from.\n8. For the fourth female, there is 1 female left to choose from.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways to feed the animals based on the options at each step.\nThe total number of ways is the product of the options at each step: 1 (for the first male) * 4 (for the first female) * 3 (for the second male) * 3 (for the second female) * 2 (for the third male) * 2 (for the third female) * 1 (for the fourth male) * 1 (for the fourth female).\n\n## Step 5: Perform the multiplication to find the total number of ways.\n1 * 4 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 144\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{144}$",
