    "## Step 1: Identify the given number\nThe given number is 91.\n\n## Step 2: Determine if the number is prime\n91 is not a prime number since it has more than two factors.\n\n## Step 3: Find the prime factors of the number\nTo find the prime factors, we start by dividing 91 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. However, 91 is odd, so 2 won't be a factor. We move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since 91 is not divisible by 3, we move to 5, 7, 11, and so on, until we find a prime factor.\n\n## Step 4: Factorize 91\nUpon trial and error or using a factorization method, we find that 91 can be factored into 7 * 13, where both 7 and 13 are prime numbers.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the sum of the prime factors\nThe sum of the prime factors of 91 is 7 + 13 = 20.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the prime factors of 91\nTo find the prime factors of 91, we need to identify the prime numbers that multiply together to give 91. We start by dividing 91 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by prime numbers until we cannot divide anymore.\n\n## Step 2: Begin dividing 91 by the smallest prime number\n91 is not divisible by 2 because it is an odd number. So, we move to the next prime number, which is 3. Since 91 is not divisible by 3, we move to the next prime number, which is 5, and then 7, and so on, until we find a prime number that divides 91.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the prime factors\nUpon inspection, 91 is divisible by 7 because 91 = 7 * 13. Both 7 and 13 are prime numbers. Therefore, the prime factors of 91 are 7 and 13.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of the prime factors\nNow, we add the prime factors together to find the sum. sum = 7 + 13 = 20.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$",
    "## Step 1: Determine the prime factors of 91\nTo find the prime factors of 91, we start by checking if 91 is divisible by the smallest prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.) until we find its factors. Since 91 is not even, we start with 3. After checking, we find that 91 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n## Step 2: Continue checking for prime factors\nMoving on to the next prime number, 11, we find that 91 divided by 11 equals 8.33, which is not a whole number, so 11 is not a factor. Then, checking the next prime number, 13, we find that 91 divided by 13 equals 7, which is a whole number. Therefore, 13 and 7 are the prime factors of 91.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the sum of the prime factors\nNow that we know the prime factors of 91 are 7 and 13, we simply add them together to find the sum of the prime factors.\n\n## Step 4: Add 7 and 13\nSum = 7 + 13 = 20\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$"

  "solution": "Since 91 is not divisible by the first three prime numbers, we try dividing $91\\div 7$.  We find a quotient of 13, so $91=7\\times 13$ and the sum of these prime factors is $7+13=\\boxed{20}$.",
