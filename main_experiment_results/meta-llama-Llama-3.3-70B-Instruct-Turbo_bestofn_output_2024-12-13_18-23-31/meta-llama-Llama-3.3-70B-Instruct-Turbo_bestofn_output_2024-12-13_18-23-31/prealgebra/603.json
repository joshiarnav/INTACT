    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the graph\nThe graph represents the total distance Sam drove from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. The x-axis shows the time of day, and the y-axis shows the total distance traveled. We need to find the average speed of the car for this period.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled\nAccording to the graph, at 6 a.m., the total distance traveled is 0 miles, and at 11 a.m., the total distance traveled is 160 miles. So, the total distance traveled from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. is 160 miles.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total time taken\nThe total time taken is from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 5 hours.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the average speed\nThe average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 160 miles / 5 hours = 32 miles per hour.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{32}$"
