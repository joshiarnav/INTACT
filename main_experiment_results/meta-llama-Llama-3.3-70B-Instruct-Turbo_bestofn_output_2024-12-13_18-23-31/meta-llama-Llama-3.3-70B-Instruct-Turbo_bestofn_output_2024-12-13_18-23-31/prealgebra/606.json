    "## Step 1: Determine the side length of the first equilateral triangle.\nThe side length of the first equilateral triangle is given as 2 units.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the side length of the second equilateral triangle.\nSince the sides of the second triangle are $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the first triangle, the side length of the second triangle is $2 \\times 1.5 = 3$ units.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the side length of the third equilateral triangle.\nThe sides of the third triangle are $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the second triangle, so the side length of the third triangle is $3 \\times 1.5 = 4.5$ units.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the side length of the fourth equilateral triangle.\nThe sides of the fourth triangle are $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the third triangle, thus the side length of the fourth triangle is $4.5 \\times 1.5 = 6.75$ units.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the perimeter of the first equilateral triangle.\nThe perimeter of an equilateral triangle is $3 \\times$ the side length. Therefore, the perimeter of the first triangle is $3 \\times 2 = 6$ units.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the perimeter of the fourth equilateral triangle.\nUsing the same formula, the perimeter of the fourth triangle is $3 \\times 6.75 = 20.25$ units.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the percent increase in the perimeter from the first triangle to the fourth triangle.\nThe percent increase is calculated by the formula $\\left( \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\right) \\times 100$. Therefore, the percent increase in the perimeter is $\\left( \\frac{20.25 - 6}{6} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{14.25}{6} \\right) \\times 100 = 2.375 \\times 100 = 237.5\\%$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{237.5}$",

    "## Step 1: Calculate the perimeter of the first equilateral triangle.\nThe perimeter of an equilateral triangle is given by $P = 3s$, where $s$ is the length of a side.

  "solution": "If the side length of each successive equilateral triangle is $150\\%$ of the previous triangle, then we can multiply the previous side length by 1.5. We will need to do this three times to get to the fourth triangle, so its side length will be $$1.5^3 = 1.5 \\times 1.5 \\times 1.5 = 3.375$$ times the  original side length. This is the same as $337.5\\%$ of the original side length, which represents a $337.5 - 100 = 237.5\\%$ increase over the original side length. The perimeter is also a length, so it will be affected in the same way. The percent increase in the perimeter is $\\boxed{237.5\\%}$.",
