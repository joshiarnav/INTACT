    "## Step 1: Calculate the time taken for the first part of the journey\nTo find the time taken, we use the formula time = distance / speed. For the first part, the distance is 20 kilometers and the speed is 40 kph. So, time = 20 km / 40 kph = 0.5 hours.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the time taken for the second part of the journey\nFor the second part, the distance is 25 kilometers and the speed is 50 kph. Using the same formula, time = 25 km / 50 kph = 0.5 hours.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the distance and time taken for the third part of the journey\nFor the third part, the speed is 60 kph and the time is 45 minutes, which is 0.75 hours. To find the distance, we use the formula distance = speed * time. So, distance = 60 kph * 0.75 hours = 45 kilometers.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the distance and time taken for the fourth part of the journey\nFor the fourth part, the speed is 48 kph and the time is 15 minutes, which is 0.25 hours. Using the same formula, distance = 48 kph * 0.25 hours = 12 kilometers.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total distance traveled\nThe total distance is the sum of the distances traveled in each part: 20 km + 25 km + 45 km + 12 km = 102 kilometers.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total time taken\nThe total time is the sum of the times taken for each part: 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours + 0.75 hours + 0.25 hours = 2 hours.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the average speed of the car\nThe average speed is calculated using the formula average speed = total distance / total time. So, average speed = 102 km / 2 hours = 51 kph.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{51}$",
    "## Step 1: Calculate the time taken to travel 20 kilometers at 40 kph\nTo find the time taken, we use the formula time = distance / speed. So, time = 20 km / 40 kph = 0.5 hours.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the time taken to travel 25 kilometers at 50 kph\nUsing the same formula, time = distance / speed, we get time = 25 km / 50 kph = 0.5 hours.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled at 60 kph for 45 minutes\nFirst, we convert 45 minutes to hours, which is 45 / 60 = 0.75 hours. Then, we use the formula distance = speed * time to find the distance traveled, which is distance = 60 kph * 0.75 hours = 45 km.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled at 48 kph for 15 minutes\nWe convert 15 minutes to hours, which is 15 / 60 = 0.25 hours. Then, using the formula distance = speed * time, we find the distance traveled, which is distance = 48 kph * 0.25 hours = 12 km.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total distance traveled\nThe total distance traveled is the sum of the distances traveled at each speed, which is 20 km + 25 km + 45 km + 12 km = 102 km.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total time taken\nThe total time taken is the sum of the times taken at each speed, which is 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours + 0.75 hours + 0.25 hours = 2 hours.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the average speed of the car\nThe average speed is calculated using the formula average speed = total distance / total time.

  "solution": "To find the average speed for the entire trip, we need to divide the total distance by the total time.  Remembering that $d=r\\cdot t$, and looking at each of the four parts of the trip, these pieces can be determined.\n\nFirst, a car traveling at 40 kph for 20 km will be traveling for $20/40=.5$ hours.  Next, a car traveling at 50 kph for 25 km will be traveling for $25/50=.5$ hours.  Next, a car traveling at 60 kph for 45 minutes (.75 hours) will travel a total of $60\\times .75=45$ km during that time.  Finally, a car traveling 48 kph for 15 minutes (.25 hours) will travel a total of $48\\times .25=12$ km.\n\nThe total distance traveled was $20+25+45+12=102$ km.  The total time was $.5+.5+.75+.25=2$ hours.  Therefore, the average speed of the car was $102/2=\\boxed{51}$ kph.",
