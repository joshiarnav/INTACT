    "## Step 1: Write down the given information\nThe average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $4x-7$. This means $\\frac{(x+6) + (6x+2) + (2x+7)}{3} = 4x - 7$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the equation\nCombine like terms in the numerator: $\\frac{x + 6 + 6x + 2 + 2x + 7}{3} = 4x - 7$. This simplifies to $\\frac{9x + 15}{3} = 4x - 7$.\n\n## Step 3: Further simplify the equation\nDivide the numerator by 3: $3x + 5 = 4x - 7$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $x$\nSubtract $3x$ from both sides: $5 = x - 7$. Then add 7 to both sides: $12 = x$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
    "## Step 1: Write down the given information\nWe are given that the average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $4x-7$. The average of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers.\n\n## Step 2: Express the average as an equation\nTo express the average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ being equal to $4x-7$, we use the formula for average: $\\frac{(x+6) + (6x+2) + (2x+7)}{3} = 4x - 7$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation\nNow, we simplify and solve the equation:\n$\\frac{x + 6 + 6x + 2 + 2x + 7}{3} = 4x - 7$.\nCombining like terms in the numerator gives:\n$\\frac{9x + 15}{3} = 4x - 7$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $x$\nTo solve for $x$, first simplify the left side of the equation:\n$3x + 5 = 4x - 7$.\nThen, rearrange the equation to isolate $x$ on one side:\n$3x - 4x = -7 - 5$,\nwhich simplifies to:\n$-x = -12$.\nMultiplying both sides by $-1$ gives:\n$x = 12$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the concept of average\nThe average of a set of numbers is found by adding all the numbers together and then dividing by the count of numbers. In this case, we're given that the average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $4x-7$. This means we can set up an equation based on the formula for average.\n\n## Step 2: Set up the equation based on the average\nThe formula for the average is $\\frac{(x+6) + (6x+2) + (2x+7)}{3} = 4x - 7$. This equation represents the average of the three given expressions equaling $4x - 7$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify and solve the equation\nFirst, combine like terms in the numerator: $(x + 6x + 2x) + (6 + 2 + 7) = 9x + 15$. So, the equation becomes $\\frac{9x + 15}{3} = 4x - 7$.\n\n## Step 4: Continue simplifying the equation\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator: $9x + 15 = 12x - 21$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $x$\nSubtract $9x$ from both sides to get $15 = 3x - 21$. Then, add 21 to both sides to get $36 = 3x$. Finally, divide both sides by 3 to solve for $x$: $x = 12$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"

  "solution": "The average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $\\dfrac{1}{3}((x+6)+(6x+2)+(2x+7))$. Simplifying this expression gives $\\dfrac{1}{3}(9x+15)=3x+5$. We know the average is also $4x-7$, so $3x+5=4x-7$. Subtracting $3x-7$ from both sides of this equation gives $x=\\boxed{12}$.",
