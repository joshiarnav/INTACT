    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to convert the fraction $\\frac{5}{33}$ into a decimal and find the digit in the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the fraction to decimal\nTo convert $\\frac{5}{33}$ into a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator: $5 \\div 33$. Performing long division, we find that $\\frac{5}{33}$ as a decimal is $0.151515...$, which is a repeating decimal.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the repeating pattern\nThe repeating pattern in the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{33}$ is $15$. This means that every two digits, the pattern repeats.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the position of the digit\nSince the pattern repeats every two digits, we need to find where the 92nd digit falls within this pattern. We divide 92 by 2, which gives us 46. This means that the pattern repeats 46 times, and since 92 is an even number, the 92nd digit will be the second digit in the repeating pattern.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the 92nd digit\nGiven that the repeating pattern is $15$, the second digit in this pattern is $5$. Therefore, the 92nd digit to the right of the decimal point is $5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

    "## Step 1: Convert the fraction to a decimal\nTo find the digit in the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point, we first need to convert the fraction $\\frac{5}{33}$ into a decimal. This can be done by dividing the numerator (5) by the denominator (33).\n\n## Step 2: Perform long division\nWe perform long division to divide 5 by 33. The result of this division is a repeating decimal.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the repeating pattern\nUpon performing the long division, we find that $\\frac{5}{33}$ equals 0.151515..., where \"15\" repeats infinitely. This means that every two digits, the pattern repeats.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the position within the repeating pattern\nGiven that the pattern \"15\" repeats every two digits, we need to find out which digit of the pattern the 92nd place corresponds to. Since 92 is an even number, it will always correspond to the second digit in the repeating pattern \"15\", which is \"5\" when the pattern starts with \"15\" as the first two digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Step 5: Account for the starting position of the pattern\nSince the pattern \"15\" starts immediately after the decimal point, and we're looking for the 92nd digit, we divide 92 by 2 (because the pattern repeats every 2 digits) to see how many complete repetitions of the pattern occur before reaching the 92nd digit. 92 divided by 2 equals 46, indicating that the pattern \"15\" repeats 46 times before reaching the 92nd digit. However, because the pattern's length is 2 and 92 is even, the 92nd digit will indeed be the second digit of the pattern \"15\", which is \"5\".\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"

  "solution": "When we write $\\frac{5}{33}$ as a decimal using long division, we get $0.\\overline{15}=0.15151515\\ldots$. Notice the pattern we have here: if $n$ is odd, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal point is $1$; if $n$ is even, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal place is $5$.
