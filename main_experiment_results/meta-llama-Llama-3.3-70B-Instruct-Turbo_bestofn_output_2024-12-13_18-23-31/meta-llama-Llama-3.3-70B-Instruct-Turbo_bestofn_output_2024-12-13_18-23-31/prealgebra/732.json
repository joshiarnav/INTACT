    "## Step 1: Determine the ratio of the portions\nThe portions are in the ratio of 1:2:7 for Amanda, Ben, and Carlos, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Find the factor by which to multiply the ratio to get Amanda's portion\nSince Amanda's portion is $\\$$20 and her ratio is 1, we need to find the factor that multiplies 1 to get 20. This factor is 20.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the portions of Ben and Carlos\nTo find Ben's portion, we multiply his ratio (2) by the factor found in step 2 (20), which gives 2 * 20 = $\\$$40. For Carlos, we multiply his ratio (7) by the factor (20), resulting in 7 * 20 = $\\$$140.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money shared\nThe total amount is the sum of the portions of Amanda, Ben, and Carlos. So, the total is 20 + 40 + 140 = $\\$$200.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{200}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given ratio of portions\nThe portions are in the ratio of 1:2:7 for Amanda, Ben, and Carlos, respectively. This means that for every 1 part Amanda gets, Ben gets 2 parts and Carlos gets 7 parts.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the value of one part\nSince Amanda's portion is $\\$$20 and her ratio is 1, we can say that 1 part is equal to $\\$$20.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of parts\nTo find the total amount of money shared, we need to calculate the total number of parts. The total number of parts is the sum of the ratios, which is 1 + 2 + 7 = 10 parts.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money shared\nNow that we know the value of one part ($\\$$20) and the total number of parts (10), we can calculate the total amount of money shared. Total amount = 10 parts * $\\$$20/part = $\\$$200.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{200}$",

  "solution": "We multiply each part of the ratio $1:2:7$ by 20 to make Amanda's part equal 20, and we have \\[1:2:7 = 1\\cdot 20:2\\cdot 20 :7\\cdot 20 = 20:40:140.\\] This means that  Ben's share is $2\\times 20 = 40$ dollars and Carlos's share is $7\\times 20=140$ dollars.  Therefore, the total amount of money shared is $20+40+140=\\boxed{200}$ dollars.",
