    "## Step 1: Recall the formula for calculating the number of diagonals in a convex polygon\nThe formula to calculate the number of diagonals in a convex polygon is given by \\(d = \\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of sides of the polygon.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the given number of sides into the formula\nGiven that the polygon has 23 sides, we substitute \\(n = 23\\) into the formula: \\(d = \\frac{23(23-3)}{2}\\).\n\n## Step 3: Perform the arithmetic to find the number of diagonals\nNow, we perform the arithmetic: \\(d = \\frac{23 \\times 20}{2}\\).\n\n## Step 4: Complete the multiplication and division\nFirst, multiply: \\(23 \\times 20 = 460\\). Then, divide by 2: \\(\\frac{460}{2} = 230\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{230}$",

  "solution": "If the polygon has 23 sides, then it has 23 vertices. A diagonal is created by choosing 2 non-adjacent vertices and connecting them. First we choose a vertex. There are 23 choices. Then we choose another vertex that is not adjacent to the one we already chose. There are 20 choices for this. However, we have double counted all the diagonals, so the number of diagonals is $\\frac{23 \\cdot 20}{2}=23 \\cdot 10=\\boxed{230} \\text{ diagonals}$.",
