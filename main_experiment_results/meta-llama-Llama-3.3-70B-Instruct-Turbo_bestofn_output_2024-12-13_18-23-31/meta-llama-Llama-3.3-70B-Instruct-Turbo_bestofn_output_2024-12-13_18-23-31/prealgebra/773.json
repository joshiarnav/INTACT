    "## Step 1: Determine the range of x based on the given conditions\nGiven that $x$ is a positive multiple of 8, we can list the multiples of 8 to find possible values of! $x$. The condition $x^2 > 100$ implies that $x > 10$ since $10^2 = 100$. Also, $x < 20$ as given.\n\n## Step 2: List the multiples of 8 within the range\nThe multiples of 8 that are greater than 10 and less than 20 are 16.\n\n## Step 3: Check if $x = 16$ satisfies the condition $x^2 > 100$\nCalculate $16^2$ to see if it is indeed greater than 100. $16^2 = 256$, which is greater than 100.\n\n## Step 4: Confirm that $x = 16$ is the only multiple of 8 within the given constraints\nSince 16 is the only multiple of 8 between 10 and 20, and it satisfies $x^2 > 100$, $x = 16$ is the solution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the conditions given for x\nWe are told that $x$ is a positive multiple of 8, which means $x$ can be represented as $8n$ where $n$ is a positive integer.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the condition that $x^2 > 100$\nTo find the possible values of $x$ that satisfy $x^2 > 100$, we take the square root of both sides of the inequality. This gives us $x > 10$ or $x < -10$. However, since $x$ is defined as a positive multiple of 8, we only consider $x > 10$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the condition that $x < 20$\nCombining this with the condition from step 2, we have $10 < x < 20$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the multiples of 8 within the range\nThe multiples of 8 within the range $10 < x < 20$ are 16.\n\n## Step 5: Verify that the multiple of 8 satisfies all conditions\n16 is a positive multiple of 8, $16^2 = 256 > 100$, and $16 < 20$.

    "To find the value of $x$, let's consider the given conditions step by step:\n\n1. **$x$ is a positive multiple of 8**: This means $x$ can be represented as $8n$, where $n$ is a positive integer. So, possible values of $x$ include 8, 16, 24, 32, and so on.\n\n2. **$x^2 > 100$**: To solve this inequality, we take the square root of both sides. Remembering that $x$ is positive, we get $x > 10$. This means $x$ must be greater than 10.\n\n3. **$x < 20$**: This condition limits the upper bound of $x$.\n\nCombining all conditions, $x$ must be a multiple of 8, greater than 10, and less than 20. The only multiple of 8 that satisfies these conditions is 16, because:\n- 8 is not greater than 10, so it's excluded.\n- 16 is a multiple of 8, greater than 10, and less than 20, making it a valid candidate.\n- 24 is greater than 20, so it's excluded.\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies all the given conditions is 16.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$"

  "solution": "This question gives multiple clues on what $x$ could be. Because $x^2>100$, we know that $x$ must be greater than 10, but $x$ is also less than 20. So $x$ is a multiple of 8 that is between 10 and 20. The only value that fits this description is $\\boxed{16}$.",
