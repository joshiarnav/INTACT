    "## Step 1: Calculate the area of the square\nThe area of the square can be found by squaring the length of one side. Since each side is 10cm, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$ square centimeters.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the area of one quarter circle\nThe radius of each quarter circle is half the length of a side of the square, which is $10/2 = 5$cm. The area of one quarter circle is $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi r^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi (5)^2 = \\frac{25}{4} \\pi$ square centimeters.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total area of the four quarter circles\nSince there are four quarter circles, the total area of the quarter circles is $4 \\times \\frac{25}{4} \\pi = 25\\pi$ square centimeters.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the shaded region\nThe area of the shaded region can be found by subtracting the total area of the four quarter circles from the area of the square. So, the area of the shaded region is $100 - 25\\pi$ square centimeters.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{100-25\\pi}$",

  "solution": "We first notice that the area of the shaded region is the area of the square minus the areas of the four quarter circles. Each quarter circle has a radius half the side length, so if we sum the areas of the four quarter circles, we have the area of one full circle with radius $5$ cm. Now, we know the area of a square is the square of its side length, so the square has an area of $100 \\text{ cm}^2$. A circle has an area of $\\pi$ times its radius squared, so the four quarter circles combined have an area of $\\pi(5)^2=25\\pi \\text{ cm}^2$. From this, we know that the area of the shaded region is $\\boxed{100-25\\pi} \\text{ cm}^2$.",
