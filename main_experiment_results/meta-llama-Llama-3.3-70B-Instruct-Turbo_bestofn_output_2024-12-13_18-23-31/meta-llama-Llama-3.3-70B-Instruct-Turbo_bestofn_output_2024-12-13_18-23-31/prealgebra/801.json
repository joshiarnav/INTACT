    "To find the ratio of nine to thirteen, we need to divide nine by thirteen.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate the ratio\nThe ratio is calculated by dividing the number of colonies required to ratify the Constitution (9) by the total number of original colonies (13). So, the ratio = 9 / 13 = 0.6923076923.\n\n## Step 2: Round the ratio to the nearest tenth\nRounding the calculated ratio to the nearest tenth gives us 0.7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.7}$"
