    "## Step 1: Find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 3 and 6\nTo find the GCF, we need to list all the factors of 3 and 6. Factors of 3 are 1 and 3. Factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The greatest common factor is 3.\n\n## Step 2: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 6\nTo find the LCM, we need to list the multiples of 3 and 6. Multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, ... . Multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, ... . The smallest multiple that appears in both lists is 6.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the sum of the GCF and LCM of 3 and 6\nNow, we add the! GCF and LCM together. sum = GCF + LCM = 3 + 6 = 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",
