    "## Step 1: We are given a triangle ABC with an altitude CD of length $\\sqrt{3}$ centimeters.\nFirst, let's analyze the given triangle ABC and the information provided. The altitude CD is $\\sqrt{3}$ centimeters, and we need to find the area of $\\Delta ABC$.\n\n## Step 2: We notice that triangle ACD is a 30-60-90 right triangle.\nSince triangle ACD is a 30-60-90 right triangle, we can use the properties of such triangles to find the lengths of its sides. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the 30-degree angle is half the length of the hypotenuse, and the side opposite the 60-degree angle is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle.\n\n## Step 3: Using the 30-60-90 triangle properties, we can determine the length of AC.\nGiven that CD is $\\sqrt{3}$ centimeters, which is the side opposite the 60-degree angle, we can find the length of AC. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the 60-degree angle is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle. So, AC is twice the length of CD, which is $2 \\times \\sqrt{3} = 2\\sqrt{3}$ centimeters.\n\n## Step 4: Next, we find the length of BC using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle.\nWe also know that triangle ABC is a 30-60-90 triangle, and we have already found the length of AC. Using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle, we can determine the length of BC. BC is twice the length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle, which is equal to 2 centimeters.\n\n## Step 5: Now, we can find the area of $\\Delta ABC$ using the formula for the area of a triangle.\nThe formula for the area of a triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times base \\times height$. In this case, the base is BC and the height is AC. So, the area of $\\Delta ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2\\sqrt{3} = 2\\sqrt{3}$ square centimeters.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{3}}$",
    "## Step 1: Identify the type of triangle\nWe notice that $\\Delta ACD$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle because $\\angle ACD = 90^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle CAD = 30^{\\circ}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the side lengths of $\\Delta ACD$\nGiven that the altitude $CD$ is $\\sqrt{3}$ centimeters, and knowing the ratios of the sides in a 30-60-90 triangle are $1 : \\sqrt{3} : 2$, we can determine that $AC = 2CD = 2\\sqrt{3}$ centimeters.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the type of triangle $\\Delta ABC$ is\n$\\Delta ABC$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle as well because $\\angle BAC = 30^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle ACB = 90^{\\circ}$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the side lengths of $\\Delta ABC$\nSince $AC = 2\\sqrt{3}$ centimeters and using the ratios of the sides in a 30-60-90 triangle, we know $AB = 2$ and $BC = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the area of $\\Delta ABC$\nThe area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula $Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\times base \\times height$. In this case, $BC$ can be considered the base and $AC$ the height. So the area of $\\Delta ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times BC \\times AC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the equation\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2\\sqrt{3} = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{3}}$",
    "## Step 1: We are given a 30-60-90 triangle ABC with altitude CD = \u221a3 centimeters.\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:\u221a3:2. Given that CD = \u221a3, we can use this information to find the length of the sides of the triangle.\n\n## Step 2: Since CD is the altitude of the triangle and is opposite the 60-degree angle, it is also the longer leg of the smaller 30-60-90 triangle ACD.\nIn triangle ACD, CD corresponds to the side opposite the 60-degree angle, so AD (the side opposite the 30-degree angle) must be half of the hypotenuse AC times \u221a3. However, we are given CD, not AC, so let's express AC using CD.\n\n## Step 3: Using the ratio of the sides in a 30-60-90 triangle, we can determine that AC = 2 * CD = 2 * \u221a3.\nThis is because in a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse (AC in this case) is twice the length of the shorter leg (which would be half of CD if we were considering the smaller triangle ACD, but here we directly use CD to find AC).\n\n## Step 4: Now that we have AC, we can find BC using the properties of the larger 30-60-90 triangle ABC.\nIn triangle ABC, AC is the side opposite the 60-degree angle, and BC is the side opposite the 30-degree angle. Therefore, BC = AC / \u221a3 = (2 * \u221a3) / \u221a3 = 2.\n\n## Step 5: The area of a triangle is given by the formula (1/2) * base * height.\nIn this case, we can consider BC as the base and CD (or the altitude) as the height. However, we need to remember that CD is the altitude to the side BC, and it splits the triangle into two smaller right-angled triangles, but for the area calculation of the whole triangle ABC, we can directly use BC as the base and the height corresponding to this base, which would be AC * \u221a3/2 (the height of the larger triangle, considering its base as BC).\n\n## Step 6: The correct height to use for the area calculation of triangle ABC is actually AC * \u221a3/2, but we can simplify our calculation by recognizing the properties of 30-60-90 triangles and directly applying the area formula with known sides.\nHowever, recognizing that triangle ABC is a 30-60-90 triangle and knowing its sides' ratios allows us to simplify. Given AC = 2\u221a3, we can find the area directly by recognizing the pattern in these triangles.\n\n## Step 7: Since we know the base and height of triangle ABC, we can calculate its area.\nArea = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * BC * AC * \u221a3/2. But recognizing the direct relationship in a 30-60-90 triangle and that AC = 2\u221a3 and BC = 2, we simplify our approach by using these known values to directly compute the area without further complications.\n\n## Step 8: The area of triangle ABC can be directly calculated using its base and height.\nSubstituting the known values: Area = (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2 square centimeters.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
