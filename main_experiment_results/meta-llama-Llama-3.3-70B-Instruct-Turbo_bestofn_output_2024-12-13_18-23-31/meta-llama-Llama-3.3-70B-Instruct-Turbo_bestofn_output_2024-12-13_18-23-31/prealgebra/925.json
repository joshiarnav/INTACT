    "## Step 1: Define the total set of numbers\nThe set of numbers is given as $\\{50, 51, 52, 53, ... , 999\\}$. To find the total count of numbers in this set, we subtract the starting number from the ending number and then add 1. Since the numbers are starting from 50 and ending at 999, the total count of numbers is $999 - 50 + 1 = 950$.\n\n## Step 2: Define the subset of two-digit numbers\nThe two-digit numbers within the given set start from 50 and go up to 99. To find the count of two-digit numbers, we subtract the starting number of the two-digit range from the ending number of that range and then add 1. Therefore, the count of two-digit numbers is $99 - 50 + 1 = 50$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of selecting a two-digit number\nThe probability of selecting a two-digit number is calculated by dividing the count of two-digit numbers by the total count of numbers in the set. So, the probability is $\\frac{50}{950}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the fraction\nThe fraction $\\frac{50}{950}$ can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50. Simplifying yields $\\frac{1}{19}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$",

    "## Step 1: Define the total set of numbers\nThe set of numbers is given as $\\{50, 51, 52, 53, ... , 999\\}$. This means the set starts from 50 and ends at 999.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of elements in the set\nTo find the total number of elements in the set, we subtract the starting number from the ending number and then add 1 to include both the starting and ending numbers. The set starts at 50 and ends at 999, so the total number of elements is $999 - 50 + 1 = 950$.\n\n## Step 3: Define the subset of two-digit numbers within the set\nThe two-digit numbers within the set start at 50 and end at 99.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of two-digit numbers in the subset\nUsing a similar approach as in step 2, we calculate the number of two-digit numbers by subtracting the starting number of the two-digit subset from the ending number of the two-digit subset and then adding 1. Therefore, the number of two-digit numbers is $99 - 50 + 1 = 50$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of selecting a two-digit number\nThe probability of selecting a two-digit number is found by dividing the number of two-digit numbers by the total number of numbers in the set.

  "solution": "To count the number of numbers in this set, we subtract 49 from all of the numbers, giving the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 950 \\}$, making it obvious that there are 950 numbers total. Furthermore, the set $\\{ 50, 51, 52, \\ldots, 98, 99 \\}$ corresponds to the more easily counted $\\{ 1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 49, 50 \\}$ by subtracting 49. So, the probability of selecting a two-digit number is $\\frac{50}{950} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$.",
