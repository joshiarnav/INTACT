    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the point on the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$ that is closest to the point $(1,2,3)$. This involves finding the equation of the line passing through $(1,2,3)$ that is perpendicular to the plane and then finding the intersection point of this line with the plane.\n\n## Step 2: Find the normal vector of the plane\nThe coefficients of $x$, $y$, and $z$ in the equation of the plane give the components of the normal vector to the plane. Thus, the normal vector $\\vec{n} = \\langle 3, -4, 5 \\rangle$.\n\n## Step 3: Parametrize the line passing through $(1,2,3)$ with direction $\\vec{n}$\nThe line passing through $(1,2,3)$ with direction $\\vec{n} = \\langle 3, -4, 5 \\rangle$ can be parametrized as:\n$x = 1 + 3t$,\n$y = 2 - 4t$,\n$z = 3 + 5t$,\nwhere $t$ is a parameter.\n\n## Step 4: Find the intersection of the line with the plane\nSubstitute the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane to find the value of $t$ at the intersection:\n$3(1 + 3t) - 4(2 - 4t) + 5(3 + 5t) = 30$.\nSimplify and solve for $t$:\n$3 + 9t - 8 + 16t + 15 + 25t = 30$,\n$50t + 10 = 30$,\n$50t = 20$,\n$t = \\frac{20}{50} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the coordinates of the intersection point\nSubstitute $t = \\frac{2}{5}$ into the parametric equations of the line to find the coordinates of the intersection point:\n$x = 1 + 3\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{11}{5}$,\n$y = 2 - 4\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = 2 - \\frac{8}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}$,\n$z = 3 + 5\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = 3 + 2 = 5$.\nSo, the point on the plane closest to $(1,2,3)$ is $\\left(\\frac{11}{5}, \\frac{2}{5}, 5\\right)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{11}{5}, \\frac{2}{5}, 5\\right)}$",
