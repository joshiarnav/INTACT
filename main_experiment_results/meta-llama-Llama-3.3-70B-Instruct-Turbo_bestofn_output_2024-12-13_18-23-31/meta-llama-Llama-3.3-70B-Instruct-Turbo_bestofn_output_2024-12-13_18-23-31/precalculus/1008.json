    "## Step 1: To find the point in the $xz$-plane that is equidistant from the given points, we first denote the point in the $xz$-plane as $(x,0,z)$ since any point in the $xz$-plane has a $y$-coordinate of 0.\nThe point is denoted as $(x,0,z)$.\n\n## Step 2: The distance formula between two points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ in 3D space is $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}$.\nWe will apply this formula to calculate the distances between $(x,0,z)$ and each of the given points.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the distance between $(x,0,z)$ and $(1,-1,0)$.\nDistance $d_1 = \\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (0 - (-1))^2 + (z - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + 1 + z^2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the distance between $(x,0,z)$ and $(2,1,2)$.\nDistance $d_2 = \\sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + (0 - 1)^2 + (z - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + 1 + (z - 2)^2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the distance between $(x,0,z)$ and $(3,2,-1)$.\nDistance $d_3 = \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + (0 - 2)^2 + (z - (-1))^2} = \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + 4 + (z + 1)^2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Since the point $(x,0,z)$ is equidistant from the three given points, we set $d_1 = d_2$ and $d_1 = d_3$.\nSetting $d_1 = d_2$ gives $\\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + 1 + z^2} = \\sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + 1 + (z - 2)^2}$.\nSetting $d_1 = d_3$ gives $\\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + 1 + z^2} = \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + 4 + (z + 1)^2}$.\n\n## Step 7: Square both sides of the equations from Step 6 to eliminate the square roots and simplify.\nFrom $d_1 = d_2$: $(x - 1)^2 + 1 + z^2 = (x - 2)^2 + 1 + (z - 2)^2$.\nExpanding both sides gives $x^2 - 2x + 1 + 1 + z^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 + 1 + z^2 - 4z + 4$.\nSimplifying yields $-2x + 2 = -4x + 9 - 4z$.\nFurther simplification gives $2x + 4z = 7$.\n\nFrom $d_1 = d_3$: $(x - 1)^2 + 1 + z^2 = (x - 3)^2 + 4 + (z + 1)^2$.\nExpanding both sides gives $x^2 - 2x + 1 + 1 + z^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9 + 4 + z^2 + 2z + 1$.\nSimplifying yields $-2x + 2 = -6x + 14 + 2z$.\nFurther simplification gives $4x - 2z = 12$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the system of linear equations obtained in Step 7.\nWe have two equations: $2x + 4z = 7$ and $4x - 2z = 12$.\nWe can solve this system by either substitution or elimination method. Let's use elimination here:\nMultiplying the first equation by 1 and the second equation by 2 gives $2x + 4z = 7$ and $8x - 4z = 24$.\nAdding these two equations to eliminate $z$ gives $10x = 31$.\nSolving for $x$ gives $x = \\frac{31}{10}$.\n\n## Step 9: Substitute the value of $x$ back into one of the equations to solve for $z$.\nUsing $2x + 4z = 7$ and substituting $x = \\frac{31}{10}$ gives $2(\\frac{31}{10}) + 4z = 7$.\nSimplifying yields $\\frac{62}{10} + 4z = 7$ or $6.2 + 4z = 7$.\nSolving for $z$ gives $4z = 7 - 6.2 = 0.8$.\nThus, $z = \\frac{0.8}{4} = 0.2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{31}{10}, \\  0, \\  \\frac{1}{5}\\right)}$",
    "## Step 1: To find the point in the $xz$-plane that is equidistant from the given points, we first need to understand what it means to be equidistant in 3D space.\nBeing equidistant means having the same distance from a point to multiple other points. The distance $d$ between two points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ in 3D space is given by the formula $d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Since the point we are looking for lies in the $xz$-plane, its $y$-coordinate must be 0. Let's denote this point as $(x, 0, z)$.\nWe need to set up equations based on the fact that the distance from $(x, 0, z)$ to each of the given points is the same.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the distance from $(x, 0, z)$ to $(1, -1, 0)$, from $(x, 0, z)$ to $(2, 1, 2)$, and from $(x, 0, z)$ to $(3, 2, -1)$, and set these distances equal to each other.\nThe distance $d_1$ from $(x, 0, z)$ to $(1, -1, 0)$ is $\\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (0 - (-1))^2 + (z - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + 1 + z^2}$.\nThe distance $d_2$ from $(x, 0, z)$ to $(2, 1, 2)$ is $\\sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + (0 - 1)^2 + (z - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + 1 + (z - 2)^2}$.\nThe distance $d_3$ from $(x, 0, z)$ to $(3, 2, -1)$ is $\\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + (0 - 2)^2 + (z - (-1))^2} = \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + 4 + (z + 1)^2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Setting $d_1 = d_2$ and $d_1 = d_3$ to find the relationships between $x$ and $z$ that make the distances equal.\nFrom $d_1 = d_2$, we have $\\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + 1 + z^2} = \\sqrt{(x - 2)^2 + 1 + (z - 2)^2}$.\nSquaring both sides gives $(x - 1)^2 + 1 + z^2 = (x - 2)^2 + 1 + (z - 2)^2$.\nExpanding both sides yields $x^2 - 2x + 1 + 1 + z^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 + 1 + z^2 - 4z + 4$.\nSimplifying, we get $-2x + 2 = -4x + 9 - 4z$, which simplifies further to $2x + 4z = 7$.\n\nFrom $d_1 = d_3$, we have $\\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + 1 + z^2} = \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + 4 + (z + 1)^2}$.\nSquaring both sides gives $(x - 1)^2 + 1 + z^2 = (x - 3)^2 + 4 + (z + 1)^2$.\nExpanding both sides yields $x^2 - 2x + 1 + 1 + z^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9 + 4 + z^2 + 2z + 1$.\nSimplifying, we get $-2x + 2 = -6x + 14 + 2z$, which simplifies further to $4x - 2z = 12$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the system of equations $2x + 4z = 7$ and $4x - 2z = 12$ to find the values of $x$ and $z$.\nFirst, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2, getting $2x - z = 6$.\nNow, we have two equations: $2x + 4z = 7$ and $2x - z = 6$.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives $5z = 1$, so $z = \\frac{1}{5}$.\nSubstituting $z = \\frac{1}{5}$ into $2x - z = 6$ gives $2x - \\frac{1}{5} = 6$, which simplifies to $2x = \\frac{31}{5}$, and thus $x = \\frac{31}{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(\\frac{31}{10}, 0, \\frac{1}{5})}$",
