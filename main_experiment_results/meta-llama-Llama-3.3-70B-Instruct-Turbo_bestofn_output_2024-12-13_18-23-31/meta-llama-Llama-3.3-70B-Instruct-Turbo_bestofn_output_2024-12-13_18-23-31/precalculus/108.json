    "## Step 1: Define the coordinates of point P\nLet's define the coordinates of point P as $(x, y, z)$.\n\n## Step 2: Use the distance formula to set up equations for AP, BP, CP, and DP\nUsing the distance formula, we can set up the following equations:\n\\[AP = \\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + y^2 + z^2}\\]\n\\[BP = \\sqrt{x^2 + (y + 4)^2 + z^2}\\]\n\\[CP = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z - 6)^2}\\]\n\\[DP = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\\]\nGiven that $AP = BP = CP = DP$, we can equate these expressions.\n\n## Step 3: Equate the expressions for AP, BP, CP, and DP\nSetting $AP = DP$, we get $\\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.\nSetting $BP = DP$, we get $\\sqrt{x^2 + (y + 4)^2 + z^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.\nSetting $CP = DP$, we get $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z - 6)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equations by squaring both sides\nSquaring both sides of each equation, we obtain:\n\\[(x - 8)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2\\]\n\\[x^2 + (y + 4)^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2\\]\n\\[x^2 + y^2 + (z - 6)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2\\]\n\n## Step 5: Solve the simplified equations\nExpanding the first equation gives $x^2 - 16x + 64 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, which simplifies to $-16x + 64 = 0$.\nExpanding the second equation gives $x^2 + y^2 + 8y + 16 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, which simplifies to $8y + 16 = 0$.\nExpanding the third equation gives $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 12z + 36 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, which simplifies to $-12z + 36 = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for x, y, and z\nSolving $-16x + 64 = 0$ for $x$ gives $x = 4$.\nSolving $8y + 16 = 0$ for $y$ gives $y = -2$.\nSolving $-12z + 36 = 0$ for $z$ gives $z = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(4, -2, 3)}$",

    "## Step 1: To find the point $P$ such that $AP = BP = CP = DP$, we should first understand what this condition implies.\nThe condition $AP = BP = CP = DP$ means that the point $P$ is equidistant from points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. This suggests that $P$ is the center of a sphere that passes through points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n\n## Step 2: Since we are dealing with a 3D space, we can represent point $P$ as $(x, y, z)$.\nWe need to find the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy the condition $AP = BP = CP = DP$.\n\n## Step 3: Using the distance formula in 3D space, we can write the equations for the distances $AP$, $BP$, $CP$, and $DP$.\nThe distance $AP$ between points $A(8,0,0)$ and $P(x,y,z)$ is given by $\\sqrt{(x-8)^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.\nThe distance $BP$ between points $B(0,-4,0)$ and $P(x,y,z)$ is given by $\\sqrt{x^2 + (y+4)^2 + z^2}$.\nThe distance $CP$ between points $C(0,0,6)$ and $P(x,y,z)$ is given by $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-6)^2}$.\nThe distance $DP$ between points $D(0,0,0)$ and $P(x,y,z)$ is given by $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Since $AP = BP = CP = DP$, we can set up equations based on these distances.\nSetting $AP = DP$, we get $\\sqrt{(x-8)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.\nSetting $BP = DP$, we get $\\sqrt{x^2 + (y+4)^2 + z^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.\nSetting $CP = DP$, we get $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-6)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Squaring both sides of each equation to eliminate the square roots and simplify.\nFrom $AP = DP$, we have $(x-8)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, which simplifies to $-16x + 64 = 0$.\nFrom $BP = DP$, we have $x^2 + (y+4)^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, which simplifies to $8y + 16 = 0$.\nFrom $CP = DP$, we have $x^2 + y^2 + (z-6)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, which simplifies to $-12z + 36 = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Solving the simplified equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$.\nSolving $-16x + 64 = 0$ gives $x = 4$.\nSolving $8y + 16 = 0$ gives $y = -2$.\nSolving $-12z + 36 = 0$ gives $z = 3$.\n\n## Step 7: Therefore, the point $P$ that satisfies the given conditions is $(4, -2, 3)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(4, -2, 3)}$"
