    "## Step 1: Identify the terms in the given series as complex numbers in trigonometric form.\nThe given series is a sum of complex numbers in trigonometric form, where each term is represented as $\\text{cis } \\theta$, which is equivalent to $e^{i\\theta}$ or $\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta$. The series starts with $\\text{cis } 75^\\circ$ and ends with $\\text{cis } 147^\\circ$, with an increment of $8^\\circ$ between consecutive terms.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of terms in the series.\nTo find the number of terms, we calculate the difference in degrees between the last and first term, and then divide by the increment, and add 1. So, the number of terms $n = \\frac{147^\\circ - 75^\\circ}{8^\\circ} + 1 = \\frac{72}{8} + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the average argument of the terms in the series.\nSince the series is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of $8^\\circ$, the average argument can be found by taking the average of the first and last term. The average argument $\\theta_{avg} = \\frac{75^\\circ + 147^\\circ}{2} = 111^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 4: Recognize that the argument of the sum is the same as the average argument of the terms.\nWhen summing complex numbers in trigonometric form that are in arithmetic progression, the argument of the sum is the same as the average argument of the terms. This is because the symmetric distribution of terms around the average argument results in the real and imaginary parts of the terms canceling out in such a way that the argument of the sum equals the average argument.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{111}$",

The first term is $75^\\circ$ and the last term is $147^\\circ$. To find the average angle, we take the average of the first and last terms: $\\frac{75^\\circ + 147^\\circ}{2} = 111^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 3: Understanding the concept of averaging angles\nWhen adding complex numbers of the same magnitude that are equally spaced around a circle, their vector sum will point in the direction of the average angle. This concept is based on the principle of symmetry and the fact that the numbers are evenly distributed around the circle.\n\n## Step 4: Applying the concept to the given problem\nSince we have a sequence of complex numbers with angles in an arithmetic progression, their sum will have an angle equal to the average angle of the sequence.

The first term is $\\text{cis } 75^\\circ$ and the last term is $\\text{cis } 147^\\circ$. The common difference between the angles is $8^\\circ$. We can calculate the number of terms using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: $a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$, where $a_n$ is the last term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the number of terms, and $d$ is the common difference. Applying this formula: $147 = 75 + (n - 1)8$. Solving for $n$: $72 = (n - 1)8$, $9 = n - 1$, $n = 10$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the average angle of the series\nSince the series is an arithmetic progression, the average angle can be found by taking the average of the first and last term. The average angle $\\theta_{avg} = \\frac{75^\\circ + 147^\\circ}{2} = 111^\\circ$. This average angle will be the angle of the resultant vector when all the terms are summed.\n\n## Step 4: Understand that the sum of the series will have the same angle as the average angle\nWhen summing complex numbers of the same magnitude in trigonometric form that are evenly distributed in angle, the resultant vector will have an angle equal to the average of the angles of the individual terms. This is because the symmetric distribution of angles around the average angle results in the real and imaginary parts of the terms that are not at the average angle cancelling out, leaving only the components that are at the average angle.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{111}$"
