    "## Step 1: To determine if two lines are coplanar, we need to check if their direction vectors are parallel or if there exists a plane that contains both lines.\nTwo lines are coplanar if their direction vectors are parallel or if they intersect. The direction vector of the first line is \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -k \\\\ k \\end{pmatrix},\\] and the direction vector of the second line is \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\n\n## Step 2: The lines are not necessarily parallel, so we need to check if they intersect or if there is a plane that contains both lines.\nFor two lines to be coplanar but not parallel, they must intersect. However, since the problem does not provide information about the lines intersecting, we will assume that the lines do not intersect but are still coplanar. In this case, their direction vectors do not have to be parallel, but we can check if there is a relationship between the direction vectors that would allow both lines to lie in the same plane.\n\n## Step 3: For two lines to be coplanar without intersecting, their direction vectors must be able to lie in the same plane. This means that the direction vectors and a vector connecting points on each line must be linearly dependent.\nHowever, without further information about the lines intersecting, we can consider another approach based on the parameterizations given. If the lines are coplanar, there might exist some linear combination of the direction vectors of the two lines that equates to zero, or the vectors could be related in such a way that they can both lie in the same plane.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the condition for the lines to be coplanar without being parallel or intersecting. This involves checking if the direction vectors of the lines and a vector connecting a point from each line can be linearly dependent.\nGiven the parameterizations, a point on the first line is $(-1, 3, 1)$, and a point on the second line is $(0, 1, -2)$ when $t = 0$ and $s = 0$. A vector connecting these points is \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 0 - (-1) \\\\ 1 - 3 \\\\ -2 - 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}.\\] For the lines to be coplanar, the direction vectors and this connecting vector must be linearly dependent.\n\n## Step 5: To find $k$ such that the lines are coplanar, we set up the linear dependence equation using the direction vectors of the two lines and the vector connecting points on each line.\nThe linear dependence equation is \\[a_1\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -k \\\\ k \\end{pmatrix} + a_2\\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + a_3\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix},\\] where $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$ are constants, not all zero.\n\n## Step 6: From the linear dependence equation, we get a system of linear equations.\n\\[a_1 + \\frac{1}{2}a_2 + a_3 = 0\\]\n\\[-ka_1 + a_2 - 2a_3 = 0\\]\n\\[ka_1 - a_2 - 3a_3 = 0\\]\n\n## Step 7: Solving this system of equations for $k$ will give us the condition under which the lines are coplanar.\nSince we are looking for a condition on $k$ that makes the lines coplanar, we can try to eliminate $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$ and find a relationship that involves $k$.\n\n## Step 8: To eliminate $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$, we can use the first equation to express $a_3$ in terms of $a_1$ and $a_2$, and substitute into the other equations.\nFrom the first equation, $a_3 = -a_1 - \\frac{1}{2}a_2$. Substituting into the second and third equations gives us equations in terms of $a_1$ and $a_2$ only.\n\n## Step 9: Substitute $a_3$ from the first equation into the second and third equations.\nSubstituting into the second equation gives: \\[-ka_1 + a_2 - 2(-a_1 - \\frac{1}{2}a_2) = 0\\]\n\\[-ka_1 + a_2 + 2a_1 + a_2 = 0\\]\n\\[(2 - k)a_1 + 2a_2 = 0\\]\nAnd substituting into the third equation gives: \\[ka_1 - a_2 - 3(-a_1 - \\frac{1}{2}a_2) = 0\\]\n\\[ka_1 - a_2 + 3a_1 + \\frac{3}{2}a_2 = 0\\]\n\\[(k + 3)a_1 + \\frac{1}{2}a_2 = 0\\]\n\n## Step 10: Now we have two equations in terms of $a_1$ and $a_2$.\n\\[(2 - k)a_1 + 2a_2 = 0\\]\n\\[(k + 3)a_1 + \\frac{1}{2}a_2 = 0\\]\nTo find $k$, we can solve this system of equations.\n\n## Step 11: Multiplying the second equation by 4 to eliminate $a_2$ when we add the equations together.\n\\[4(k + 3)a_1 + 2a_2 = 0\\]\nNow we have:\n\\[(2 - k)a_1 + 2a_2 = 0\\]\n\\[(4k + 12)a_1 + 2a_2 = 0\\]\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives: \\[(4k + 12 - (2 - k))a_1 = 0\\]\n\\[(5k + 10)a_1 = 0\\]\n\n## Step 12: For the equation $(5k + 10)a_1 = 0$ to be true, either $a_1 = 0$ or $5k + 10 = 0$.\nSince $a_1$ cannot be zero for all cases (as it's a part of the linear dependence condition), we solve $5k + 10 = 0$ for $k$.\n\n## Step 13: Solve $5k + 10 = 0$ for $k$.\n\\[5k = -10\\]\n\\[k = -2\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-2}$"
