    "## Step 1: Understanding the problem statement\nThe problem involves finding the probability that a specific condition is met regarding the absolute value of the sum of two distinct, randomly chosen roots of the equation $z^{1997} - 1 = 0.$\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the roots of the equation\nThe roots of the equation $z^{1997} - 1 = 0$ are the $1997$th roots of unity, which are located at the vertices of a regular $1997$-gon in the complex plane, centered at the origin.\n\n## Step 3: Expressing roots in trigonometric form\nWe can express the roots in trigonometric form. Let $v = \\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right)$ and $w = \\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi m}{1997}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac {2\\pi m}{1997}\\right),$ where $k$ and $m$ are integers, $0 \\le k < 1997,$ $0 \\le m < 1997,$ and $k \\neq m.$\n\n## Step 4: Calculating the sum of the roots\nThe sum of $v$ and $w$ can be expressed as $v + w = \\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + \\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi m}{1997}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac {2\\pi m}{1997}\\right).$\n\n## Step 5: Finding the absolute value of the sum\nUsing the trigonometric form of $v + w,$ we find that $|v + w|^2 = 2 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi (k - m)}{1997}\\right).$\n\n## Step 6: Applying the given condition\nThe given condition $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\le\\left|v+w\\right|$ can be squared to obtain $|v + w|^2\\ge 2 + \\sqrt {3}.$ This implies $\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi (k - m)}{1997}\\right)\\ge \\frac {\\sqrt {3}}2.$\n\n## Step 7: Finding the range of the cosine function\nThe range of the cosine function that satisfies the inequality $\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi (k - m)}{1997}\\right)\\ge \\frac {\\sqrt {3}}2$ is $\\frac {\\pi}6\\ge \\frac {2\\pi (k - m)}{1997}\\ge - \\frac {\\pi}6.$\n\n## Step 8: Calculating the possible values of $k - m$\nThe possible values of $k - m$ that satisfy the inequality are $166\\ge k - m\\ge -166.$ There are $332$ values of $k - m$ between $-166$ and $166,$ inclusive, excluding $0$ because $k$ and $m$ must be distinct.\n\n## Step 9: Finding the total possible pairs of roots\nSince there are $1997$ possible values of $k$ and $1996$ possible values of $m$ for each $k,$ there are $1997\\cdot 1996$ total possible pairs $(k, m).$\n\n## Step 10: Calculating the probability\nThe desired probability is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is $\\frac{332 \\cdot 1997}{1997\\cdot 1996} = \\frac{332}{1996} = \\frac{83}{499}.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{83}{499}}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nThe problem asks us to find the probability that for two distinct, randomly chosen roots $v$ and $w$ of the equation $z^{1997} - 1 = 0$, the absolute value of their sum $|v + w|$ is greater than or equal to $\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{3}}$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the roots of the equation\nThe roots of $z^{1997} - 1 = 0$ are the $1997$th roots of unity, which can be expressed as $e^{i\\frac{2\\pi k}{1997}}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 1996$.\n\n## Step 3: Express $v$ and $w$ in terms of the roots of unity\nLet $v = e^{i\\theta}$ and $w = e^{i\\phi}$, where $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi k}{1997}$ and $\\phi = \\frac{2\\pi l}{1997}$ for some integers $k$ and $l$ with $0 \\leq k < l \\leq 1996$.\n\n## Step 4: Compute $|v + w|^2$\nUsing the expressions for $v$ and $w$, we can compute $|v + w|^2 = (v + w)(\\overline{v} + \\overline{w}) = 2 + v\\overline{w} + \\overline{v}w = 2 + 2\\cos(\\theta - \\phi)$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the condition for $|v + w|$\nFor $|v + w|$ to be greater than or equal to $\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{3}}$, we need $|v + w|^2 \\geq 2 + \\sqrt{3}$. This implies $\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\geq \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the range of $\\theta - \\phi$\nThe condition $\\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\geq \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is satisfied when $-\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\leq \\theta - \\phi \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ or $-\\frac{11\\pi}{6} \\leq \\theta - \\phi \\leq -\\frac{5\\pi}{6}$, considering the principal range of $\\cos^{-1}$.\n\n## Step 7: Express the conditions in terms of $k$ and $l$\nThe conditions on $\\theta - \\phi$ translate to $-\\frac{1997\\pi}{6} \\leq 2\\pi\\frac{k-l}{1997} \\leq \\frac{1997\\pi}{6}$ and $-\\frac{11\\cdot1997\\pi}{6} \\leq 2\\pi\\frac{k-l}{1997} \\leq -\\frac{5\\cdot1997\\pi}{6}$. Simplifying gives $-333 \\leq k - l \\leq 333$ and $-3333 \\leq k - l \\leq -1667$.\n\n## Step 8: Restrict to the relevant range of $k$ and $l$\nSince $0 \\leq k < l \\leq 1996$, the relevant condition is $-333 \\leq k - l \\leq 333$. However, because $k < l$, we consider $0 < l - k \\leq 333$.\n\n## Step 9: Count the number of pairs $(k, l)$ satisfying the condition\nFor any given $k$, $l$ can range from $k + 1$ to $\\min(k + 333, 1996)$. Summing over all valid $k$ gives the total number of pairs satisfying the condition.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the total number of distinct pairs $(v, w)$\nThe total number of distinct pairs $(v, w)$ is the number of ways to choose 2 items from 1997, which is ${1997 \\choose 2} = \\frac{1997 \\cdot 1996}{2}$.\n\n## Step 11: Compute the probability\nThe probability is the ratio of the number of successful outcomes (pairs satisfying the condition) to the total number of outcomes.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate the sum for the number of successful pairs\nThe sum for the number of successful pairs can be evaluated as $\\sum_{k=0}^{1996} \\min(k + 333, 1996) - k - 1 = \\sum_{k=0}^{1663} 333 + \\sum_{k=1664}^{1996} 1996 - k - 1$.\n\n## Step 13: Simplify the sum\nThe sum simplifies to $333 \\cdot 1664 + \\sum_{k=1664}^{1996} 1995 - k$.\n\n## Step 14: Evaluate the simplified sum\nEvaluating the sum yields $333 \\cdot 1664 + \\frac{(1995 - 1664)(1996 - 1664 + 1)}{2} = 554,112 + \\frac{331 \\cdot 333}{2}$.\n\n## Step 15: Final calculation of the number of successful pairs\nThe final calculation is $554,112 + 54,915 = 609,027$.\n\n## Step 16: Calculate the probability\nThe probability is $\\frac{609,027}{\\frac{1997 \\cdot 1996}{2}} = \\frac{609,027}{1997 \\cdot 998} = \\frac{609,027}{1,995,006}$.\n\n## Step 17: Simplify the fraction\nThe fraction simplifies to $\\frac{87}{284}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{87}{284}}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem involves finding the probability that a specific condition is met regarding the absolute value of the sum of two distinct, randomly chosen roots of the equation $z^{1997}-1=0$. The condition given is $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\le\\left|v+w\\right|$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the roots of the equation\nThe roots of $z^{1997} = 1$ are the $1997$th roots of unity, which are located at the vertices of a regular $1997$-gon in the complex plane, centered at the origin. These roots can be expressed as $e^{2\\pi ik/1997}$ for $k = 0, 1, \\ldots, 1996$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the condition for $|v + w|$\nTo find the condition under which $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\le\\left|v+w\\right|$, we should express $v$ and $w$ as $e^{2\\pi iv/1997}$ and $e^{2\\pi iw/1997}$ and then calculate $|v + w|$.\n\n## Step 4: Express $v$ and $w$ and calculate $|v + w|$\nLet $v = e^{2\\pi iv/1997}$ and $w = e^{2\\pi iw/1997}$. Then, $|v + w|$ can be calculated using the formula for the sum of two complex numbers. We will use the fact that $|e^{i\\theta}| = 1$ for any $\\theta$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the triangle inequality and properties of complex numbers\nWe note that $|v + w|^2 = (v + w)(\\overline{v} + \\overline{w}) = 2 + v\\overline{w} + \\overline{v}w$. By expressing $v$ and $w$ in terms of their exponential forms, we can simplify this expression.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression for $|v + w|^2$\nSubstituting $v = e^{2\\pi iv/1997}$ and $w = e^{2\\pi iw/1997}$ into the expression for $|v + w|^2$ gives $2 + e^{2\\pi i(v-w)/1997} + e^{-2\\pi i(v-w)/1997} = 2 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi(v-w)}{1997}\\right)$. Thus, $|v + w|^2 = 2 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi(v-w)}{1997}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the condition $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\le\\left|v+w\\right|$\nThe condition $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\le\\left|v+w\\right|$ translates to $(\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}})^2 \\le |v + w|^2$, which means $2 + \\sqrt{3} \\le 2 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi(v-w)}{1997}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the inequality for $\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi(v-w)}{1997}\\right)$\nThe inequality simplifies to $\\sqrt{3} \\le 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi(v-w)}{1997}\\right)$, or $\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi(v-w)}{1997}\\right) \\ge \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. This implies that $\\frac{2\\pi(v-w)}{1997}$ must be within $30^\\circ$ or $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ radians of $0$ or $2\\pi$, due to the periodic nature of the cosine function and its value at $0$ and $2\\pi$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the range of $v - w$\nSince $\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi(v-w)}{1997}\\right) \\ge \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, the angle $\\frac{2\\pi(v-w)}{1997}$ should be within $\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ of $0$ or $2\\pi$. This gives us two ranges for $v - w$: $-\\frac{1997\\pi}{6\\cdot2\\pi} \\le v - w \\le \\frac{1997\\pi}{6\\cdot2\\pi}$ and $\\frac{1997\\pi}{2\\pi} - \\frac{1997\\pi}{6\\cdot2\\pi} \\le v - w \\le \\frac{1997\\pi}{2\\pi} + \\frac{1997\\pi}{6\\cdot2\\pi}$, which simplifies to $-166 \\le v - w \\le 166$ and $831 \\le v - w \\le 966$ (considering $v$ and $w$ are integers from $0$ to $1996$).\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes\nFor any given $v$, the values of $w$ that satisfy the condition are those within $166$ units of $v$ (in either direction) and those that wrap around from the end of the range back to the start (due to the cyclic nature of the roots). This results in $332$ possible values of $w$ for each $v$ (excluding $v = w$), except for cases where $v$ is near the \"edges\" of the range (i.e., $v < 166$ or $v > 1996 - 166$), where the number of possible $w$ values is reduced.\n\n## Step 11: Account for edge cases\nWhen $v$ is near the edges (i.e., $v < 166$ or $v > 1831$), the number of valid $w$ values is reduced because there are fewer values within the $166$-unit range. However, these edge cases are symmetric and can be accounted for by considering the wrap-around cases.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the total number of possible pairs $(v, w)$\nSince there are $1997$ possible values for $v$ and $1996$ remaining possible values for $w$ (excluding $v = w$), the total number of possible pairs $(v, w)$ is $1997 \\times 1996$.\n\n## Step 13: Calculate the probability\nThe probability that a randomly chosen pair $(v, w)$ satisfies the given condition is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\n## Step 14: Determine the number of favorable pairs\nSince each $v$ can pair with $332$ other $w$ values (on average, considering the wrap-around and excluding the case where $v = w$), and there are $1997$ possible $v$ values, the total number of favorable pairs is $1997 \\times 332 / 2$ (divided by $2$ to avoid double-counting each pair).\n\n## Step 15: Calculate the final probability\nThe final probability is the number of favorable pairs divided by the total number of possible pairs.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{332}{1996}}$"
