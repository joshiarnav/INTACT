    "## Step 1: To find the fourth vertex of the regular tetrahedron, we should first understand the properties of a regular tetrahedron.\nA regular tetrahedron has four equilateral triangular faces, and all its edges have the same length. Given three vertices, we can find the fourth vertex by utilizing the fact that the fourth vertex must be equidistant from the other three vertices.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the distances between the given points to find the length of the edges of the tetrahedron.\nThe distance between two points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ in 3D space is given by $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 + (z_2-z_1)^2}$. Let's denote the given points as $A(0,1,2)$, $B(4,2,1)$, and $C(3,1,5)$, and calculate the distances $AB$, $AC$, and $BC$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the distance AB.\nUsing the distance formula: $AB = \\sqrt{(4-0)^2 + (2-1)^2 + (1-2)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 1 + 1} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the distance AC.\nUsing the distance formula: $AC = \\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (1-1)^2 + (5-2)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 0 + 9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the distance BC.\nUsing the distance formula: $BC = \\sqrt{(3-4)^2 + (1-2)^2 + (5-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1 + 16} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Since all distances are equal, the length of an edge of the tetrahedron is $3\\sqrt{2}$.\nThis confirms that the tetrahedron is regular since all edges have the same length.\n\n## Step 7: The fourth vertex $D$ must be equidistant from $A$, $B$, and $C$, with a distance of $3\\sqrt{2}$.\nThis means that $D$ lies on the spheres centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, each with a radius of $3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n## Step 8: Finding the exact coordinates of $D$ requires solving the system of equations derived from the distance formula.\nHowever, given the constraint that the coordinates of $D$ are integers, we can look for integer solutions that satisfy the distances.\n\n## Step 9: Utilize the fact that for a regular tetrahedron, the altitude from any vertex to the opposite face is also the perpendicular bisector of the opposite edge.\nThis property can help in finding the direction and position of the fourth vertex relative to the plane formed by the other three vertices.\n\n## Step 10: Considering the symmetry and properties of a regular tetrahedron, and given the integer constraint, we can deduce the possible location of the fourth vertex.\nThe fourth vertex should be symmetrically positioned relative to the triangle formed by the other three vertices, and its coordinates should allow it to be equidistant from them.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(3, 2, 0)}$",
    "## Step 1: The distance between any two vertices of a regular tetrahedron is the same.\nTo find the fourth vertex, we first need to calculate the distance between the given vertices.
