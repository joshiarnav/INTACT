    "## Step 1: Analyze the given equations to identify any immediate implications or simplifications.\nWe start with the given equations: $a^3 b^5 = 1$ and $a^7 b^2 = 1$. We aim to simplify or manipulate these equations to find relationships between $a$ and $b$.\n\n## Step 2: Manipulate the first equation to express $b^5$ in terms of $a^3$.\nFrom $a^3 b^5 = 1$, we can express $b^5$ as $b^5 = \\frac{1}{a^3}$.\n\n## Step 3: Manipulate the second equation to express $b^2$ in terms of $a^7$.\nFrom $a^7 b^2 = 1$, we can express $b^2$ as $b^2 = \\frac{1}{a^7}$.\n\n## Step 4: Combine the expressions for $b^5$ and $b^2$ to find a relationship between $a$ and $b$.\nRaising the expression for $b^2$ to the power of $\\frac{5}{2}$ gives $b^5 = \\left(\\frac{1}{a^7}\\right)^{\\frac{5}{2}} = \\frac{1}{a^{\\frac{35}{2}}}$. Equating this to $b^5 = \\frac{1}{a^3}$ from Step 2, we get $\\frac{1}{a^3} = \\frac{1}{a^{\\frac{35}{2}}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $a$ from the relationship found in Step 4.\nFor the equation $\\frac{1}{a^3} = \\frac{1}{a^{\\frac{35}{2}}}$ to hold, the exponents must be equal, leading to $3 = \\frac{35}{2}$. However, this is not an equation in terms of $a$ but rather an incorrect manipulation. The correct approach should involve using the given equations to directly find relationships between $a$ and $b$ without incorrectly equating exponents.\n\n## Step 6: Correct the approach by directly manipulating the given equations.\nStarting over, from $a^3 b^5 = 1$ and $a^7 b^2 = 1$, we can raise the first equation to the power of 2 and the second equation to the power of 5 to align the powers of $b$. This yields $(a^3 b^5)^2 = 1^2$ and $(a^7 b^2)^5 = 1^5$, resulting in $a^6 b^{10} = 1$ and $a^{35} b^{10} = 1$.\n\n## Step 7: Use the corrected equations to find a relationship between $a$ and $b$.\nDividing the two resulting equations ($a^{35} b^{10} = 1$ by $a^6 b^{10} = 1$) gives $a^{29} = 1$. This indicates that $a$ must be a 29th root of unity.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the implications of $a^{29} = 1$ for $a$ and $b$.\nSince $a^{29} = 1$, $a$ is a 29th root of unity. We then use $a^7 b^2 = 1$ to find $b$. Given $a^{29} = 1$, we can express $a^7$ as $a^7 = a^{29-22} = a^{-22}$ (since $a^{29} = 1$), but more directly, knowing $a$ is a root of unity helps in understanding that $b$ can be determined once $a$ is known.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for $b$ given $a^7 b^2 = 1$ and knowing $a$ is a 29th root of unity.\nGiven $a$ is a 29th root of unity, for any given $a$, $b$ is determined by $b^2 = \\frac{1}{a^7}$. Given $a^{29} = 1$, for every $a$, there's a corresponding $b$ that satisfies both original equations.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the number of ordered pairs $(a, b)$.\nSince $a$ must be a 29th root of unity, and for each $a$ there's a corresponding $b$ that satisfies the equations, we need to count how many 29th roots of unity there are. The number of $n$th roots of unity is $n$, so there are 29 possible values for $a$. For each $a$, there is exactly one $b$ that satisfies the given conditions, leading to 29 ordered pairs $(a, b)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{29}$",
    "## Step 1:  Analyze the given equations to identify any relationships or constraints between $a$ and $b$.\nFrom $a^3 b^5 = 1$ and $a^7 b^2 = 1$, we need to find relationships that can help in simplifying the problem.\n\n## Step 2: Manipulate the given equations to simplify or find a direct relationship between $a$ and $b$.\nRaising the first equation to the power of 2 and the second equation to the power of 5 gives $a^6 b^{10} = 1$ and $a^{35} b^{10} = 1$, respectively.\n\n## Step 3: Use the manipulated equations to eliminate one of the variables or to find a condition that both $a$ and $b$ must satisfy.\nDividing these two equations, we get $a^{35} b^{10} / a^6 b^{10} = 1 / 1$, which simplifies to $a^{29} = 1$. This indicates that $a$ must be a 29th root of unity.\n\n## Step 4: Apply a similar manipulation to find a condition for $b$.\nSimilarly, raising the first equation to the power of 7 and the second to the power of 3 gives $a^{21} b^{35} = 1$ and $a^{21} b^{6} = 1$, respectively. Dividing these, we get $b^{35} / b^6 = 1 / 1$, simplifying to $b^{29} = 1$. Thus, $b$ must also be a 29th root of unity.\n\n## Step 5: Use the conditions found for $a$ and $b$ to determine their possible values and the constraints on these values.\nSince both $a$ and $b$ are 29th roots of unity, we can express them as $a = e^{2\\pi ik/29}$ and $b = e^{2\\pi il/29}$ for some integers $k$ and $l$.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the original equations to the expressions for $a$ and $b$ to find any further constraints on $k$ and $l$.\nSubstituting $a$ and $b$ into $a^3 b^5 = 1$ gives $e^{6\\pi ik/29} e^{10\\pi il/29} = 1$, or $e^{2\\pi i(6k + 10l)/29} = 1$. This implies $6k + 10l \\equiv 0 \\mod 29$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the constraint to make it easier to analyze and solve.\nSimilarly, substituting into $a^7 b^2 = 1$ gives $e^{14\\pi ik/29} e^{4\\pi il/29} = 1$, or $e^{2\\pi i(14k + 4l)/29} = 1$. This implies $14k + 4l \\equiv 0 \\mod 29$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the system of linear congruences to find the relationship between $k$ and $l$.\nWe have two congruences: $6k + 10l \\equiv 0 \\mod 29$ and $14k + 4l \\equiv 0 \\mod 29$. Multiplying the first by 2 and the second by 5 gives $12k + 20l \\equiv 0 \\mod 29$ and $70k + 20l \\equiv 0 \\mod 29$. Subtracting these equations, we get $58k \\equiv 0 \\mod 29$, which simplifies to $29k \\equiv 0 \\mod 29$, implying $k \\equiv 0 \\mod 29$.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the implications of $k \\equiv 0 \\mod 29$ on the values of $a$ and $b$.\nGiven $k \\equiv 0 \\mod 29$, $a$ must be $1$ since $e^{2\\pi i \\cdot 0 / 29} = 1$. Substituting $a = 1$ into one of the original equations, say $a^3 b^5 = 1$, yields $b^5 = 1$, meaning $b$ is a 5th root of unity.\n\n## Step 10: Find the number of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ satisfying the given conditions.\nSince $a$ must be $1$ and $b$ can be any 5th root of unity, and there are 5 fifth roots of unity (including 1), there are 5 possible values for $b$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{29}$",
    "## Step 1: Analyze the given equations\nWe are given the equations $a^3 b^5 = 1$ and $a^7 b^2 = 1$. We need to find the number of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of complex numbers that satisfy these equations.\n\n## Step 2: Manipulate the equations to simplify\nWe can start by manipulating the given equations to simplify and find relationships between $a$ and $b$. Raising the first equation to the power of 2 and the second equation to the power of 5 gives $a^6 b^{10} = 1$ and $a^{35} b^{10} = 1$, respectively.\n\n## Step 3: Derive a relationship between $a$ and $b$\nDividing the two resulting equations from step 2, we obtain $\\frac{a^{35} b^{10}}{a^6 b^{10}} = 1$, which simplifies to $a^{29} = 1$. This indicates that $a$ must be a 29th root of unity.\n\n## Step 4: Further simplify the equations\nFrom the equation $a^7 b^2 = 1$, we can express $b^2$ as $b^2 = \\frac{1}{a^7}$. Substituting $a^{29} = 1$ into this expression gives $b^2 = a^{22}$, since $a^{29} = 1$ implies $a^{22} = \\frac{1}{a^7}$.\n\n## Step 5: Derive the value of $b$\nNow, using the equation $a^3 b^5 = 1$, we can express $b^5$ as $b^5 = \\frac{1}{a^3}$. Substituting $b^2 = a^{22}$ into this equation gives $b^5 = (a^{22})^{\\frac{5}{2}} = a^{55} = \\frac{1}{a^3}$. Since $a^{29} = 1$, $a^{55} = a^{26}$, implying $a^{26} = \\frac{1}{a^3}$, or $a^{29} = 1$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $b$ using $a^{29} = 1$\nGiven $a^{29} = 1$, we have $b^2 = a^{22}$. Then, $b = \\pm a^{11}$, as $b^2 = a^{22}$ implies $b = \\pm \\sqrt{a^{22}} = \\pm a^{11}$.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute $b = \\pm a^{11}$ back into the original equations\nSubstituting $b = \\pm a^{11}$ into the equation $a^3 b^5 = 1$ yields $a^3 (\\pm a^{11})^5 = 1$, which simplifies to $a^3 (\\pm a^{55}) = 1$, or $a^3 (\\pm a^{26}) = 1$, since $a^{29} = 1$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the resulting equation\nThis gives $a^3 (\\pm a^{26}) = a^3 (\\pm a^{-3}) = \\pm a^0 = \\pm 1$. For this equation to hold true, $a^3$ must be equal to $\\pm 1$, since $\\pm 1$ are the only values that, when multiplied by $\\pm 1$, yield $\\pm 1$.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the possible values of $a$\nThe possible values of $a$ are the cube roots of unity, which are $1, e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}}, e^{\\frac{4\\pi i}{3}}$, and the 29th roots of unity that satisfy $a^{29} = 1$.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the number of possible ordered pairs\nHowever, we must consider that $b = \\pm a^{11}$. For each valid $a$, there are two corresponding $b$ values, except when $a^{11} = 1$ or $a^{11} = -1$, in which case $b$ has only one value. Since $a^{29} = 1$, the values of $a$ are restricted to the 29th roots of unity.\n\n## Step 11: Find the number of 29th roots of unity that are also cube roots of unity\nAmong the 29th roots of unity, we need to find those that are also cube roots of unity. The cube roots of unity are $1, e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}}, e^{\\frac{4\\pi i}{3}}$. We need to check which of these satisfy $a^{29} = 1$.\n\n## Step 12: Determine the final number of ordered pairs\nSince $1^{29} = 1$, $e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}}$ and $e^{\\frac{4\\pi i}{3}}$ do not satisfy $a^{29} = 1$ because their 29th powers do not equal 1. Thus, we only consider the 29th roots of unity.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{29}$"
