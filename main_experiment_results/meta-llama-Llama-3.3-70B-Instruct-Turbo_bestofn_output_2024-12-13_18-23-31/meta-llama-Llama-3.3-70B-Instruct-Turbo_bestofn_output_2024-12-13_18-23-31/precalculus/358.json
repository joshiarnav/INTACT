    "## Step 1: Recall the condition for a matrix to be invertible\nA matrix is invertible if its determinant is not equal to zero. Therefore, for the given matrix to be not invertible, its determinant must be equal to zero.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the determinant of the matrix\nThe determinant of a 2x2 matrix \\[\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}\\] is given by the formula $ad - bc$. For the given matrix \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 + x & 7 \\\\ 3 - x & 8 \\end{pmatrix},\\] the determinant is $(1+x)(8) - (7)(3-x)$.\n\n## Step 3: Set the determinant equal to zero and solve for $x$\nWe set the determinant equal to zero: $(1+x)(8) - (7)(3-x) = 0$. Expanding both products gives $8 + 8x - 21 + 7x = 0$. Combining like terms yields $15x - 13 = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for $x$\nAdding 13 to both sides of the equation gives $15x = 13$. Dividing both sides by 15 gives $x = \\frac{13}{15}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{13}{15}}$",
