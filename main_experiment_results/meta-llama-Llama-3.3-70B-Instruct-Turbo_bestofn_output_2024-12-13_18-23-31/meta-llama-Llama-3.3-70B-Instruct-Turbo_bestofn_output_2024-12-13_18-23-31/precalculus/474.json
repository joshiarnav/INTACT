    "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nThe problem requires finding the smallest positive integer $n$ such that all the roots of the given polynomial $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the given polynomial\nWe start by factoring the given polynomial $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$. This can be done by recognizing it as a quadratic equation in terms of $z^2$. Let's use $y = z^2$, transforming the equation into $y^2 - y + 1 = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation for $y$\nUsing the quadratic formula $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = 1$, we get $y = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{-3} = i\\sqrt{3}$, the solutions for $y$ are $y = \\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Express $y$ in polar form\nThe solutions for $y$ can be expressed in polar form. Recall that $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)$. The magnitude of both solutions is $1$ since $\\sqrt{(\\frac{1}{2})^2 + (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2} = 1$. The angles for $\\frac{1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\\frac{1 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ are $60^\\circ$ and $-60^\\circ$ (or equivalently, $300^\\circ$), respectively, which in radians are $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and $-\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ (or $\\frac{5\\pi}{3}$).\n\n## Step 5: Find $z$ in terms of $y$\nSince $y = z^2$, $z = \\sqrt{y}$. The square roots of $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$ and $e^{i\\frac{5\\pi}{3}}$ will give us the roots of the original equation.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the square roots of $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$ and $e^{i\\frac{5\\pi}{3}}$\nThe square roots of $e^{i\\theta}$ are $e^{i\\frac{\\theta}{2}}$ and $e^{i\\frac{\\theta}{2} + i\\pi}$ because adding $\\pi$ to the angle gives the negative of the original value, which is the other square root. Thus, the roots are $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$, $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{6} + i\\pi} = e^{i\\frac{7\\pi}{6}}$, $e^{i\\frac{5\\pi}{6}}$, and $e^{i\\frac{5\\pi}{6} + i\\pi} = e^{i\\frac{11\\pi}{6}}$.\n\n## Step 7: Identify the $n$ for which these roots are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity\nThe roots $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$, $e^{i\\frac{7\\pi}{6}}$, $e^{i\\frac{5\\pi}{6}}$, and $e^{i\\frac{11\\pi}{6}}$ correspond to the $12^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity because $e^{i2\\pi} = 1$, and the angles $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$, $\\frac{7\\pi}{6}$, $\\frac{5\\pi}{6}$, and $\\frac{11\\pi}{6}$ are all fractions of $2\\pi$ that divide it into 12 parts.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given equation and its roots\nThe given equation is $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$. To find its roots, we can use a substitution to simplify it into a quadratic equation. Let $y = z^2$, so the equation becomes $y^2 - y + 1 = 0$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the quadratic equation for $y$\nUsing the quadratic formula $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = 1$, we find $y = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{-3} = i\\sqrt{3}$, the roots for $y$ are $y = \\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Express the roots of $y$ in polar form\nThe roots $\\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ can be expressed in polar form. Since $\\frac{1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2} = e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$ and $\\frac{1 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2} = e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$, these are the polar forms of the roots of $y$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the roots of $z$\nGiven $y = z^2$, the roots of $z$ are the square roots of the roots of $y$. Hence, $z = \\pm \\sqrt{e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{3}}} = \\pm e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$ and $z = \\pm \\sqrt{e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{3}}} = \\pm e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the smallest $n$ for which all roots of $z$ are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity\nAn $n^{\\text{th}}$ root of unity is given by $e^{i\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}}$, where $k$ is an integer. The roots of $z$ are $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$, $e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$, $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{6} + i\\pi} = e^{i\\frac{7\\pi}{6}}$, and $e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{6} + i\\pi} = e^{-i\\frac{7\\pi}{6}}$. To find the smallest $n$ such that all these roots satisfy the equation for an $n^{\\text{th}}$ root of unity, we observe that $n$ must be such that $\\frac{2\\pi k}{n} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ and $\\frac{2\\pi k}{n} = \\frac{7\\pi}{6}$ for some integer $k$. The smallest $n$ that satisfies both conditions is 12, because $\\frac{2\\pi}{12} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ and $\\frac{14\\pi}{12} = \\frac{7\\pi}{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the given equation and its relation to roots of unity.\nThe given equation is $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$. To find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that all the roots of this equation are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity, we first need to understand what it means to be an $n^{\\text{th}}$ root of unity. An $n^{\\text{th}}$ root of unity is a complex number that, when raised to the $n^{\\text{th}}$ power, equals 1.\n\n## Step 2: Manipulate the given equation to find a connection to roots of unity.\nThe equation can be rewritten by substituting $y = z^2$, which transforms it into $y^2 - y + 1 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in terms of $y$, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula: $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. For our equation, $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = 1$. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula gives us $y = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $y$ and then back-substitute for $z$.\nSince $\\sqrt{-3}$ can be expressed as $i\\sqrt{3}$ (where $i$ is the imaginary unit), the solutions for $y$ are $y = \\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. These values represent $z^2$, so to find $z$, we take the square root of $y$. The square roots of $\\frac{1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\\frac{1 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ are the complex numbers $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$, $e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$, $e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}$, and $e^{-i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}$, which can also be written as $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) \\pm i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ and $\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) \\pm i\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)$, respectively.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the roots of unity.\nRecognizing that $e^{i\\theta}$ represents $\\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)$, the solutions $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$, $e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$, $e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}$, and $e^{-i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}$ correspond to the 6th roots of unity because $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$ and $e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}$ are primitive 6th roots of unity, and their conjugates are also 6th roots of unity.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the smallest $n$ for which all roots are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity.\nGiven that the roots are 6th roots of unity, the smallest positive integer $n$ for which all the roots of the given equation are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity is $n = 12$, because the roots of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ are also roots of $z^{12} = 1$ (as 12th roots of unity include all the 6th roots of unity), but we need to verify if there's no smaller $n$ that satisfies this condition.\n\n## Step 6: Verification of $n$.\nConsidering the properties of roots of unity and the specific roots derived from the given equation, we need to ensure that $n = 12$ is indeed the smallest positive integer that encompasses all these roots as $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity. Since the roots are equally spaced around the unit circle and correspond to the vertices of a regular hexagon (for 6th roots of unity), and considering that a 12th root of unity includes these points, $n = 12$ is indeed the smallest $n$ that makes all roots of the equation $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"

  "solution": "Multiplying the equation $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ by $z^2 + 1$, we get $z^6 + 1 = 0$.  Multiplying this equation by $z^6 - 1 = 0$, we get $z^{12} - 1 = 0$.
