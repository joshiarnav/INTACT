    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nTo compute the product of two matrices, we need to follow the rules of matrix multiplication. Given two matrices A and B, the element in the ith row and jth column of the resulting matrix is calculated as the dot product of the ith row of matrix A and the jth column of matrix B.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the matrices\nMatrix A is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 5 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}$ and Matrix B is $\\begin{pmatrix} 8 & -2 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the first element of the resulting matrix\nThe first element is the dot product of the first row of Matrix A and the first column of Matrix B. So, it is $(2)(8) + (0)(1) = 16 + 0 = 16$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the second element of the resulting matrix\nThe second element is the dot product of the first row of Matrix A and the second column of Matrix B. So, it is $(2)(-2) + (0)(1) = -4 + 0 = -4$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the third element of the resulting matrix\nThe third element is the dot product of the second row of Matrix A and the first column of Matrix B. So, it is $(5)(8) + (-3)(1) = 40 - 3 = 37$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the fourth element of the resulting matrix\nThe fourth element is the dot product of the second row of Matrix A and the second column of Matrix B. So, it is $(5)(-2) + (-3)(1) = -10 - 3 = -13$.\n\n## Step 7: Assemble the resulting matrix\nThe resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 16 & -4 \\\\ 37 & -13 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 16 & -4 \\\\ 37 & -13 \\end{pmatrix}}$",

    "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the matrices given\nTo compute the product of two matrices, we need to follow the rules of matrix multiplication. Given matrices A and B, where A is a 2x2 matrix and B is a 2x2 matrix, the resulting matrix C will also be a 2x2 matrix. The elements of C are computed as the dot product of rows of A with columns of B.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the elements of the matrices\nMatrix A is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 5 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}$ and Matrix B is $\\begin{pmatrix} 8 & -2 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. We will compute each element of the resulting matrix C using the formula $C_{ij} = A_{i1}B_{1j} + A_{i2}B_{2j}$.\n\n## Step 3: Compute the element C11\nFor C11, we take the first row of A (2, 0) and the first column of B (8, 1), and compute the dot product: $C_{11} = (2)(8) + (0)(1) = 16 + 0 = 16$.\n\n## Step 4: Compute the element C12\nFor C12, we take the first row of A (2, 0) and the second column of B (-2, 1), and compute the dot product: $C_{12} = (2)(-2) + (0)(1) = -4 + 0 = -4$.\n\n## Step 5: Compute the element C21\nFor C21, we take the second row of A (5, -3) and the first column of B (8, 1), and compute the dot product: $C_{21} = (5)(8) + (-3)(1) = 40 - 3 = 37$.\n\n## Step 6: Compute the element C22\nFor C22, we take the second row of A (5, -3) and the second column of B (-2, 1), and compute the dot product: $C_{22} = (5)(-2) + (-3)(1) = -10 - 3 = -13$.\n\n## Step 7: Assemble the resulting matrix C\nNow that we have computed all elements of C, we can assemble the resulting matrix: $C = \\begin{pmatrix} 16 & -4 \\\\ 37 & -13 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 16 & -4 \\\\ 37 & -13 \\end{pmatrix}}$"
