    "## Step 1: Understand the given equation in spherical coordinates\nThe equation given is $\\rho = c$, where $\\rho$ represents the distance from a point to the origin in spherical coordinates.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the meaning of $\\rho$ in spherical coordinates\nIn spherical coordinates, $\\rho$ is the radial distance from the origin to the point in space. This means that every point with a given value of $\\rho$ is at the same distance from the origin.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the shape described by the equation\nSince $\\rho$ represents the distance from the origin and the equation states that this distance is a constant $c$, all points that satisfy this equation form a sphere around the origin with radius $c$. This is because all points on the surface of a sphere are equidistant from the center of the sphere.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the correct option\nGiven the description of the shape as a sphere, we can identify the correct option.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(D)}$",
    "## Step 1: Understanding Spherical Coordinates\nIn spherical coordinates, a point in space is represented by three quantities: \\(\\rho\\), \\(\\theta\\), and \\(\\phi\\). Here, \\(\\rho\\) is the radial distance from the origin, \\(\\theta\\) is the azimuthal angle in the xy-plane from the positive x-axis, and \\(\\phi\\) is the polar angle from the positive z-axis.\n\n## Step 2: Interpreting the Given Equation\nThe equation given is \\(\\rho = c\\), where \\(c\\) is a positive constant. This means that the radial distance from the origin to any point on the shape described by this equation is always \\(c\\).\n\n## Step 3: Visualizing the Shape\nSince \\(\\rho\\) represents the distance from the origin and is constant, it implies that every point with this \\(\\rho\\) value lies on the surface of a sphere. The values of \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\phi\\) can vary, allowing the point to be anywhere on the surface of a sphere with radius \\(c\\), but the distance from the origin remains constant at \\(c\\).\n\n## Step 4: Identifying the Correct Option\nBased on the understanding that a constant \\(\\rho\\) value describes a sphere in spherical coordinates, we can identify the correct option.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(D)}$",
