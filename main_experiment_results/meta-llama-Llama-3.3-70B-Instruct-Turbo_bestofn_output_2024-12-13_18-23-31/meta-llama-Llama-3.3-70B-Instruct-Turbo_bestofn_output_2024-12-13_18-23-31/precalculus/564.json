    "## Step 1: Identify the formula for dilation\nThe formula to perform a dilation centered at a point $z_0$ with scale factor $k$ on a point $z$ is given by $z' = k(z - z_0) + z_0$. Here, $z_0 = -1 + 4i$ is the center of dilation, $k = -2$ is the scale factor, and $z = 2i$ is the point to be dilated.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the given values into the dilation formula\nSubstituting $z_0 = -1 + 4i$, $k = -2$, and $z = 2i$ into the formula $z' = k(z - z_0) + z_0$.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the calculation\n$z' = -2(2i - (-1 + 4i)) + (-1 + 4i)$\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression inside the parentheses\n$z' = -2(2i + 1 - 4i) + (-1 + 4i)$\n$z' = -2(1 - 2i) + (-1 + 4i)$\n\n## Step 5: Distribute the scale factor\n$z' = -2 + 4i + (-1 + 4i)$\n\n## Step 6: Combine like terms\n$z' = -2 - 1 + 4i + 4i$\n$z' = -3 + 8i$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-3 + 8i}$",
