    "## Step 1: Find the vector normal to the given plane\nThe equation of the given plane is $x + 2y + 3z = 5.$ The coefficients of $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ in the equation of a plane give the components of its normal vector. Thus, the vector normal to the given plane is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}.$\n\n## Step 2: Find the direction vector of the line connecting the two given points\nThe two given points are $(-1,1,1)$ and $(1,-1,1).$ The direction vector of the line connecting these points is found by subtracting the coordinates of the first point from the coordinates of the second point, which gives $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 - (-1) \\\\ -1 - 1 \\\\ 1 - 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$\n\n## Step 3: Find the normal vector of the target plane\nSince the target plane is perpendicular to the given plane, the normal vector of the target plane must be parallel to the given plane. This means it is also perpendicular to the normal vector of the given plane. Additionally, the target plane contains the line connecting the two given points, so its normal vector must be perpendicular to the direction vector of this line. We can find the normal vector of the target plane by taking the cross product of the direction vector of the line and the normal vector of the given plane: $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (-2)\\cdot3 - 0\\cdot2 \\\\ 0 - 2\\cdot3 \\\\ 2\\cdot2 - (-2)\\cdot1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -6 \\\\ -6 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}.$ We can simplify this vector to $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ by dividing all its components by $6,$ which is the greatest common divisor of the components.\n\n## Step 4: Write the equation of the target plane\nThe equation of a plane can be written in the form $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0,$ where $\\begin{pmatrix} A \\\\ B \\\\ C \\end{pmatrix}$ is the normal vector of the plane. Using the normal vector $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ found in the previous step, we have $-x - y + z + D = 0.$ To find $D,$ we substitute the coordinates of one of the given points into this equation. Using $(-1,1,1),$ we have $-(-1) - 1 + 1 + D = 0,$ which gives $1 - 1 + 1 + D = 0,$ so $1 + D = 0,$ and thus $D = -1.$ Therefore, the equation of the target plane is $-x - y + z - 1 = 0,$ or equivalently, $x + y - z + 1 = 0.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1x + 1y -1z + 1 = 0}$",
    "## Step 1: Find the vector normal to the given plane\nThe equation of the given plane is $x + 2y + 3z = 5$. The coefficients of $x$, $y$, and $z$ in the equation of a plane give the components of its normal vector. Thus, the vector normal to the given plane is $\\vec{n} = \\langle 1, 2, 3 \\rangle$.\n\n## Step 2: Find the vector between the two given points\nThe two given points are $(-1,1,1)$ and $(1,-1,1)$. The vector between these two points can be found by subtracting their coordinates. Thus, the vector between these two points is $\\vec{v} = \\langle 1 - (-1), -1 - 1, 1 - 1 \\rangle = \\langle 2, -2, 0 \\rangle$.\n\n## Step 3: Find a vector normal to the plane we are trying to find\nSince the plane we are trying to find is perpendicular to the given plane, its normal vector must be parallel to the given plane. Also, since the plane we are trying to find contains the two given points, its normal vector must be perpendicular to the vector between these two points. The cross product of $\\vec{n}$ and $\\vec{v}$ will give a vector that is perpendicular to both, thus it will be normal to the plane we are trying to find.

We can simplify this vector to $\\langle 1, 1, -1 \\rangle$ by dividing all its components by 6.\n\n## Step 4: Write the equation of the plane using the point-normal form\nUsing the point-normal form of the equation of a plane $A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) = 0$, where $\\langle A, B, C \\rangle$ is the normal vector to the plane and $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is a point on the plane, we can write the equation of the plane. Let's use the point $(-1, 1, 1)$ and the normal vector $\\langle 1, 1, -1 \\rangle$. The equation becomes:\n$1(x - (-1)) + 1(y - 1) - 1(z - 1) = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the equation of the plane\nSimplifying the equation from step 4:\n$1(x + 1) + 1(y - 1) - 1(z - 1) = 0$,\n$x + 1 + y - 1 - z + 1 = 0$,\n$x + y - z + 1 = 0$.\nRearranging to have the constant term on the right side and to ensure $A > 0$:\n$x + y - z + 1 = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1x + 1y -1z + 1 = 0}$",
    "## Step 1: Find the normal vector to the given plane\nTo find the equation of a plane that is perpendicular to another plane, we first need to identify the normal vector of the given plane. The equation of the given plane is $x + 2y + 3z = 5$. The coefficients of $x$, $y$, and $z$ in the equation of a plane give the components of its normal vector. Thus, the normal vector to the given plane is $\\mathbf{n} = \\langle 1, 2, 3 \\rangle$.\n\n## Step 2: Find the direction vector of the line connecting the two points\nThe two points given are $(-1,1,1)$ and $(1,-1,1)$. The direction vector of the line connecting these two points can be found by subtracting the coordinates of the first point from the coordinates of the second point. Thus, the direction vector $\\mathbf{d} = \\langle 1 - (-1), -1 - 1, 1 - 1 \\rangle = \\langle 2, -2, 0 \\rangle$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the normal vector to the plane we are trying to find\nSince the plane we are trying to find is perpendicular to the given plane, its normal vector must be parallel to the given plane. This means the normal vector of our plane will be perpendicular to the direction vector $\\mathbf{d}$ found in Step 2. To find a vector that is perpendicular to both $\\mathbf{n}$ and $\\mathbf{d}$, we can take the cross product of $\\mathbf{n}$ and $\\mathbf{d}$.
