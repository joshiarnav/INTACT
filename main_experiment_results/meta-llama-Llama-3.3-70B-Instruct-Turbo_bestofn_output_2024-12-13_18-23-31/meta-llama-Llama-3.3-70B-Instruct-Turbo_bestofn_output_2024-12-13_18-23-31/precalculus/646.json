    "## Step 1: Recall the definition of orthogonal vectors\nTwo vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix}$ are orthogonal if their dot product is zero, i.e., $a \\cdot c + b \\cdot d = 0$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the definition to the given vectors\nFor the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$ to be orthogonal, the dot product $2 \\cdot x + 5 \\cdot (-3)$ must equal zero.\n\n## Step 3: Set up and solve the equation\nThe equation based on the dot product is $2x - 15 = 0$. Solving for $x$, we get $2x = 15$, which gives $x = \\frac{15}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{2}}$",

    "## Step 1: Recall the definition of orthogonal vectors\nTwo vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is equal to zero. The dot product of two vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix}$ is given by $ac + bd$.\n\n## Step 2: Write down the vectors\nVector 1 is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$ and Vector 2 is $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation for the dot product\nThe dot product of the two vectors must be zero for them to be orthogonal. So, we have $2x + 5(-3) = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for x\n$2x - 15 = 0$. Solving for $x$, we get $2x = 15$, thus $x = \\frac{15}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{2}}$"
