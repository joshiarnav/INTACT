    "To find the period of $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, we need to recall the general formula for the period of a cosine function, which is $y = \\cos(Bx)$. The period of this function is given by $\\frac{2\\pi}{|B|}$.\n\nIn the given function, $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, we can identify that $B = \\frac{1}{2}$, since $\\frac{x}{2}$ can be seen as $\\frac{1}{2}x$.\n\nNow, applying the formula for the period with $B = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n\nPeriod $= \\frac{2\\pi}{|B|} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\left|\\frac{1}{2}\\right|} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\\pi \\times 2 = 4\\pi$.\n\nTherefore, the period of $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$ is $\\boxed{4\\pi}$.",
    "To find the period of $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, we need to recall the general formula for the period of a cosine function, which is $y = \\cos bx$. The period of this function is given by $\\frac{2\\pi}{|b|}$.\n\nIn our case, the function is $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$. Comparing this with the general form $y = \\cos bx$, we can see that $b = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we substitute $b = \\frac{1}{2}$ into the formula for the period: $\\frac{2\\pi}{|b|} = \\frac{2\\pi}{|\\frac{1}{2}|} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 4\\pi$.\n\nSo, the period of $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$ is $4\\pi$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4\\pi}$",
    "To find the period of $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, we need to recall the standard period of the cosine function, which is $2\\pi$. The standard cosine function is $y = \\cos x$, and its period is $2\\pi$ because the cosine function repeats every $2\\pi$ units of $x$.\n\nHowever, in the given function $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, the angle inside the cosine is $\\frac{x}{2}$ instead of just $x$. This means that the function will repeat when $\\frac{x}{2}$ has increased by $2\\pi$, because that's when the cosine of the angle will start to repeat its values.\n\nSo, we set up the equation $\\frac{x}{2} = 2\\pi$ to find when the function first repeats. Solving for $x$, we multiply both sides by 2:\n\n$\\frac{x}{2} \\cdot 2 = 2\\pi \\cdot 2$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$x = 4\\pi$\n\nTherefore, the period of $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$ is $4\\pi$ because that's the interval at which the function starts repeating itself.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4\\pi}$"
