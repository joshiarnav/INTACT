    "## Step 1: Recall the relationship between the centroid and the vertices of a triangle\nThe centroid (G) of a triangle divides the median into a 2:1 ratio, where the longer segment is between the vertex and the centroid.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the centroidal mean formula\nThe centroidal mean formula states that for a triangle ABC with centroid G, $GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = \\frac{1}{3}(AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2)$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the given information to find $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$\nGiven $GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = 58$, we can substitute this value into the centroidal mean formula: $58 = \\frac{1}{3}(AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2)$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$\nTo isolate $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3: $3 \\times 58 = AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the value of $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$\n$3 \\times 58 = 174$, so $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2 = 174$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{174}$",
    "## Step 1: Recall the definition of a centroid in a triangle\nThe centroid (G) of a triangle is the point where the three medians intersect. A median of a triangle is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. This means that the centroid divides each median into two segments, one of which is two-thirds of the entire median, and the other of which is one-third of the median.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the relationship between the centroid and the vertices\nGiven that G is the centroid of triangle ABC, we know that the distance from G to any vertex (say A) is 2/3 of the distance from the midpoint of the opposite side (say M, the midpoint of BC) to vertex A. However, a more relevant relationship for this problem involves the squares of the distances from the centroid to the vertices and the squares of the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the formula relating centroid distances to side lengths\nThere is a formula that relates the sum of the squares of the distances from the centroid to the vertices of a triangle to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides of the triangle. This formula is:\n\\[GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = \\frac{1}{3}(AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2)\\]\nThis formula essentially states that the sum of the squares of the distances from the centroid to the vertices is one-third the sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for the sum of the squares of the side lengths\nGiven that $GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = 58$, we can substitute this into the formula and solve for $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$.\n\\[58 = \\frac{1}{3}(AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2)\\]\nTo find $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3.\n\\[AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2 = 58 \\times 3\\]\n\\[AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2 = 174\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{174}$",
    "## Step 1: Recall the definition of a centroid in a triangle\nThe centroid (G) of a triangle is the point where the three medians intersect. A median of a triangle is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. This means that the centroid is always located inside the triangle, and it divides each median into two segments, with the segment connecting the centroid to the vertex being twice as long as the segment connecting the centroid to the midpoint of the opposite side.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the relationship between the centroid and the vertices of a triangle regarding distances\nThere is a theorem stating that for any triangle, the sum of the squares of the distances from the centroid to each vertex is equal to one-third of the sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides of the triangle. Mathematically, this can be expressed as $GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = \\frac{1}{3}(AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2)$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the relationship to solve for $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$\nGiven $GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = 58$, we can substitute this into the equation from Step 2 to find $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$. Thus, $58 = \\frac{1}{3}(AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2)$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$\nTo find $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$. This gives $3 \\times 58 = AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$, which simplifies to $174 = AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{174}$"
