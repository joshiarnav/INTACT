    "## Step 1: Factor out the common term\nWe start by factoring out the common term $\\sin x$ from the given equation: $2\\sin^3 x - 5 \\sin^2 x + 2 \\sin x = \\sin x(2\\sin^2 x - 5\\sin x + 2) = 0$.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the quadratic term\nNext, we factor the quadratic term $2\\sin^2 x - 5\\sin x + 2$ into $(2\\sin x - 1)(\\sin x - 2) = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Set each factor equal to zero\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us the following equations:\n- $\\sin x = 0$\n- $2\\sin x - 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow \\sin x = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $\\sin x - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow \\sin x = 2$\n\n## Step 4: Identify the valid solutions for $\\sin x$\nSince $\\sin x$ can only take values between -1 and 1, the solution $\\sin x = 2$ is not valid. Therefore, we are left with $\\sin x = 0$ and $\\sin x = \\frac{1}{2}$ as the potential solutions.\n\n## Step 5: Find the solutions for $\\sin x = 0$ in the given range\nFor $\\sin x = 0$, the solutions in the range $0 \\le x \\le 2\\pi$ are $x = 0$, $x = \\pi$, and $x = 2\\pi$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the solutions for $\\sin x = \\frac{1}{2}$ in the given range\nFor $\\sin x = \\frac{1}{2}$, the solutions in the range $0 \\le x \\le 2\\pi$ are $x = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ and $x = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$.\n\n## Step 7: Count the total number of solutions\nWe have 3 solutions for $\\sin x = 0$ and 2 solutions for $\\sin x = \\frac{1}{2}$, giving us a total of $3 + 2 = 5$ solutions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
