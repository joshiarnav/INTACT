    "## Step 1: Recall the general equation of a plane\nThe general equation of a plane in 3-dimensional space is given by $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0$, where $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are constants.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the significance of the foot of the perpendicular\nThe foot of the perpendicular from the origin to a plane represents the point on the plane that is closest to the origin. This point is significant because the vector from the origin to this point is perpendicular to the plane.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the normal vector of the plane\nThe vector from the origin to the foot of the perpendicular, which is $(12, -4, 3)$, serves as a normal vector to the plane. This is because it is perpendicular to the plane by definition.\n\n## Step 4: Use the point-normal form of a plane equation\nGiven a point $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ that lies on a plane and a normal vector $(A, B, C)$ to the plane, the equation of the plane can be written as $A(x - x_1) + B(y - y_1) + C(z - z_1) = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute the given point and normal vector into the equation\nSubstituting the point $(12, -4, 3)$ and the normal vector $(12, -4, 3)$ into the equation gives $12(x - 12) - 4(y - (-4)) + 3(z - 3) = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the equation\nExpanding the equation yields $12x - 144 - 4y - 16 + 3z - 9 = 0$. Simplifying further gives $12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Ensure the equation meets the required format\nThe equation $12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0$ already has $A > 0$. To ensure $\\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|) = 1$, we observe that the greatest common divisor of $12$, $4$, $3$, and $169$ is $1$, so no further simplification is needed.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0}$",

This point is significant because the vector from the origin to this point is perpendicular to the plane.\n\n## Step 3: Use the given point to find the normal vector of the plane.\nGiven that the foot of the perpendicular is at $(12, -4, 3)$, the vector from the origin to this point is $\\vec{n} = \\langle 12, -4, 3 \\rangle$. This vector is normal (perpendicular) to the plane.\n\n## Step 4: Construct the equation of the plane using the normal vector and the given point.\nThe equation of a plane can be constructed using a normal vector $\\vec{n} = \\langle A, B, C \\rangle$ and a point on the plane $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ as $A(x - x_1) + B(y - y_1) + C(z - z_1) = 0$.

The coefficients are integers, $A > 0$, and we need to check if $\\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1$.\n\n## Step 7: Check the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coefficients.\nThe GCD of $12$, $4$, $3$, and $169$ is $1$ since $169$ is a prime number and does not share common factors with $12$, $4$, or $3$ other than $1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0}$",
