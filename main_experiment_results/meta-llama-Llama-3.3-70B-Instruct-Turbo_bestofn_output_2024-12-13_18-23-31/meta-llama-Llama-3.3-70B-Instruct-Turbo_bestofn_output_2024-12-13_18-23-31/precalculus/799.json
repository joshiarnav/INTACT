    "## Step 1: Understanding the equation\nThe given equation is in polar form: $r = \\frac{1}{1 - \\cos \\theta}$. To identify the curve, we need to analyze this equation.\n\n## Step 2: Manipulating the equation\nWe can manipulate the equation by multiplying both sides by $1 - \\cos \\theta$ to get $r(1 - \\cos \\theta) = 1$. This simplifies to $r - r\\cos \\theta = 1$.\n\n## Step 3: Converting to Cartesian coordinates\nTo better understand the curve, we can convert the equation to Cartesian coordinates using the relationships $x = r\\cos \\theta$ and $y = r\\sin \\theta$. Substituting these into our equation gives us $r - x = 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Expressing $r$ in terms of $x$ and $y$\nSince $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, we substitute $r$ in the equation $r - x = 1$ to get $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - x = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Rearranging the equation\nRearranging the equation gives $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = x + 1$. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root yields $x^2 + y^2 = (x + 1)^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Expanding and simplifying\nExpanding the right side gives $x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1$. Subtracting $x^2$ from both sides simplifies the equation to $y^2 = 2x + 1$.\n\n## Step 7: Identifying the curve\nThe equation $y^2 = 2x + 1$ represents a parabola. A parabola is a U-shaped curve that opens to the right or to the left. In this case, it opens to the right.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(C)}$",

    "## Step 1: Identify the equation\nThe equation given is in polar coordinates: $r = \\frac{1}{1 - \\cos \\theta}$.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the equation to Cartesian coordinates\nTo understand what curve this equation represents, it can be helpful to convert it into Cartesian coordinates. Recall that $x = r \\cos \\theta$ and $y = r \\sin \\theta$. We can manipulate the given equation to fit into these formulas.\n\n## Step 3: Manipulate the equation\nStarting with $r = \\frac{1}{1 - \\cos \\theta}$, multiply both sides by $(1 - \\cos \\theta)$ to get $r(1 - \\cos \\theta) = 1$. This simplifies to $r - r \\cos \\theta = 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute Cartesian coordinates\nSubstitute $r$ with $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $r \\cos \\theta$ with $x$ to get $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - x = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$\nRearrange the equation to isolate $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$: $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = x + 1$.\n\n## Step 6: Square both sides\nTo eliminate the square root, square both sides of the equation: $(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})^2 = (x + 1)^2$. This simplifies to $x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the equation\nSubtract $x^2$ from both sides to simplify: $y^2 = 2x + 1$.\n\n## Step 8: Identify the curve\nThe equation $y^2 = 2x + 1$ represents a parabola. A parabola is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to the focus and the directrix. The standard form of a parabola equation with its vertex at the origin is $y^2 = 4ax$, where $a$ is the distance from the vertex to the focus. Comparing this standard form with our equation, we see that our equation can be rewritten as $y^2 = 2(x + \\frac{1}{2})$, indicating that it is a parabola shifted $\\frac{1}{2}$ unit to the left.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(C)}$"
