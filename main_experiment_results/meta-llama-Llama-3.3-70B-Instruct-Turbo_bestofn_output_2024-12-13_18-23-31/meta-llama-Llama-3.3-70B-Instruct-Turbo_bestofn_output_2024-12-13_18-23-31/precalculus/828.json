    "## Step 1: Recall the relationship between the angle of vectors and their negatives\nThe angle between two vectors is defined by the dot product formula $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = |\\mathbf{a}| |\\mathbf{b}| \\cos(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the vectors. When considering the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, we should note that multiplying a vector by a scalar (in this case, $-1$) does not change its direction but reverses it. This means the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ will be different from the angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the relationship between the original angle and the new angle\nSince the vector $-\\mathbf{a}$ points in the opposite direction of $\\mathbf{a}$, the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ will be the supplement of the angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$. This is because the sum of an angle and its supplement is $180^\\circ$. If the angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is $43^\\circ$, then the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ will be $180^\\circ - 43^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the new angle\nTo find the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, subtract the original angle from $180^\\circ$. Therefore, the new angle is $180^\\circ - 43^\\circ = 137^\\circ$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{137}$",
    "## Step 1: Recall the relationship between the angle of vectors and their negatives\nWhen considering the angle between two vectors, taking the negative of one of the vectors will change the direction of that vector. This means the angle between the original vector and another vector will be different when one of the vectors is negated.\n\n## Step 2: Determine how negating a vector affects the angle\nNegating a vector essentially reverses its direction. The angle between two vectors is measured as the smallest angle between their directions. When one vector is reversed, the smallest angle between them becomes the supplement of the original angle, because we're now looking at the angle from the opposite side.\n\n## Step 3: Apply this understanding to the given vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$\nGiven that the angle between vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is $43^\\circ$, when we negate vector $\\mathbf{a}$ to get $-\\mathbf{a}$, the new angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ will be the supplement of $43^\\circ$. This is because negating $\\mathbf{a}$ flips its direction, so the angle we consider is now on the other side of the vector $\\mathbf{b}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the supplement of the given angle\nThe supplement of an angle $\\theta$ is $180^\\circ - \\theta$. Thus, the supplement of $43^\\circ$ is $180^\\circ - 43^\\circ = 137^\\circ$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{137}$",
    "## Step 1: Recall the definition of the angle between two vectors\nThe angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product formula $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = |\\mathbf{a}| |\\mathbf{b}| \\cos(\\theta),$ where $\\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$. Given that the angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is $43^\\circ$, we know $\\cos(43^\\circ) = \\frac{\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}}{|\\mathbf{a}| |\\mathbf{b}|}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the effect of negating a vector on the angle\nNegating a vector, i.e., multiplying it by $-1$, reverses its direction. Therefore, if $\\mathbf{a}$ is replaced by $-\\mathbf{a}$, the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ will be different. To find this new angle, we consider how the dot product changes when $\\mathbf{a}$ is replaced by $-\\mathbf{a}$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the effect of negation to the dot product\nThe dot product of $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is given by $(-\\mathbf{a}) \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = -(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b})$. This implies that the cosine of the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ will be the negative of the cosine of the angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, since $\\cos(\\theta_{-\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}}) = \\frac{(-\\mathbf{a}) \\cdot \\mathbf{b}}{|-\\mathbf{a}| |\\mathbf{b}|} = -\\frac{\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}}{|\\mathbf{a}| |\\mathbf{b}|} = -\\cos(43^\\circ)$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the angle corresponding to the negative cosine value\nGiven that $\\cos(43^\\circ)$ is positive, $-\\cos(43^\\circ)$ corresponds to an angle in the second quadrant, where cosine values are negative. The angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, therefore, is $180^\\circ - 43^\\circ = 137^\\circ$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{137}$"
