    "## Step 1: Understanding the problem\nThe given equation is $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$, and we are asked to find the number of solutions on the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$. To solve this, we need to analyze the behavior of the tangent function and its inverse.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the equation\nThe equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ can be simplified by recognizing that $\\tan (\\theta) = \\tan (\\alpha)$ implies $\\theta = \\alpha + k\\pi$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus, we have $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ if and only if $\\tan x = x + k\\pi$ for some integer $k$.\n\n## Step 3: Understanding the behavior of $\\tan x$ and $x$\nWe know that the range of $\\tan x$ is $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, and $\\tan x$ is periodic with period $\\pi$. Also, $\\tan x$ is strictly increasing on the interval $(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$. The given interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$ falls within this range.\n\n## Step 4: Graphical analysis\nTo visualize the solutions, we can plot the graphs of $y = \\tan x$ and $y = x$ on the same coordinate system. Since $\\tan x > x$ for $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the graph of $y = \\tan x$ lies above the line $y = x$ in this interval.\n\n## Step 5: Finding the intersection points\nThe solutions to the equation $\\tan x = x$ correspond to the intersection points of the graphs $y = \\tan x$ and $y = x$. Since $\\tan x$ is periodic and $x$ is a straight line, these intersection points will occur at regular intervals.\n\n## Step 6: Counting the number of solutions\nThe interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$ corresponds to the region where $0 \\le \\tan x \\le 942$. Since $\\tan x$ is strictly increasing in this interval, we need to count the number of intersection points between the graph of $y = \\tan x$ and the line $y = x$ within this range.\n\n## Step 7: Determining the bounds for $k$\nWe want to find the largest integer $k$ such that $k\\pi \\le 942$. This will give us the number of cycles of the $\\tan x$ function within the given interval.\n\n## Step 8: Calculating the bounds for $k$\nTo find the largest integer $k$, we divide $942$ by $\\pi$ and take the floor of the result: $k = \\lfloor \\frac{942}{\\pi} \\rfloor$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculating $k$\nUsing a calculator, we find that $\\frac{942}{\\pi} \\approx 299.73$. Therefore, $k = \\lfloor 299.73 \\rfloor = 299$.\n\n## Step 10: Accounting for the solution at $x = 0$\nIn addition to the solutions corresponding to the intersection points, we also have a solution at $x = 0$. This solution satisfies the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$.\n\n## Step 11: Finding the total number of solutions\nThe total number of solutions is equal to the number of intersection points plus one (for the solution at $x = 0$). Since there are $299$ cycles of the $\\tan x$ function within the given interval, and each cycle corresponds to one intersection point, the total number of solutions is $299 + 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{300}$",
    "## Step 1: Understanding the problem statement\nWe need to find the number of solutions of the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ within the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$. This involves analyzing the behavior of the tangent function and its inverse.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$\nFor the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ to hold true, the arguments of the tangent functions must be equal or differ by an integer multiple of $\\pi$, since the tangent function has a period of $\\pi$. This gives us $x = \\tan x + k\\pi$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\n## Step 3: Considering the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$\nGiven that $0 \\le x \\le! \\tan^{-1} 942$, we know that $0 \\le \\tan x \\le 942$. We also know that $\\tan \\theta > \\theta$ for $0 < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.

The number of intersection points within the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$ can be found by dividing the upper limit of $\\tan x$ by $\\pi$ and adding 1.\n\n## Step 6: Calculating the final answer\nWe have $\\tan x \\le 942$. To find the number of solutions, we can calculate $\\frac{942}{\\pi} \\approx 300$. However, we need to consider that the interval starts at 0, so we should add 1 to account for the solution at $x = 0$.

    "## Step 1: Understanding the given equation\nWe need to find the number of solutions to the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ on the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$. This means we are looking for values of $x$ where the graph of $\\tan x$ intersects the graph of $\\tan (\\tan x)$ within the specified interval.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the behavior of $\\tan x$ and $\\tan (\\tan x)$\nThe function $\\tan x$ is periodic with period $\\pi$ and has vertical asymptotes at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi$, where $k$ is an integer. The function $\\tan (\\tan x)$ is also periodic but with a more complex behavior due to the nesting of the tangent function. However, we know that $\\tan \\theta > \\theta$ for $0 < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which gives us a clue about the growth rate of $\\tan x$ compared to $x$ itself.\n\n## Step 3: Identifying intersection points\nFor the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ to have a solution, the graphs of $\\tan x$ and $\\tan (\\tan x)$ must intersect. This happens when $\\tan x$ and $\\tan (\\tan x)$ have the same value, which occurs at $x = \\tan x + k\\pi$, where $k$ is an integer. However, because we're dealing with $\\tan (\\tan x)$, the equation simplifies to $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ when $\\tan x$ is equal to its own period, essentially meaning $\\tan x$ must equal an integer multiple of $\\pi$ for the graphs to intersect due to the periodic nature of $\\tan x$.\n\n## Step 4: Considering the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$\nGiven that $\\tan x > x$ for $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, and knowing that $\\tan^{-1} 942$ is slightly less than $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ because $\\tan \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ is undefined and approaches infinity as $x$ approaches $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we need to count how many times the graph of $\\tan (\\tan x)$ intersects $\\tan x$ within this interval.\n\n## Step 5: Counting the solutions\nLet $y = \\tan x$. Then we are solving $y = \\tan y$ for $0 \\le y \\le 942$. Because $\\tan y$ has a period of $\\pi$, and its value increases from $0$ to infinity as $y$ goes from $0$ to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, for each interval of length $\\pi$ (i.e., $[0, \\pi], [\\pi, 2\\pi], \\ldots$), there will be exactly one solution where $\\tan y = y$ due to the intermediate value theorem and the fact that $\\tan y$ goes from $0$ to infinity within each period.\n\n## Step 6: Calculating the number of periods of $\\pi$ within the range $0$ to $942$\nTo find out how many solutions exist, we divide the maximum value $942$ by $\\pi$ to see how many periods of $\\pi$ fit within the range $0$ to $942$. This calculation gives us an approximate number of periods, but since we're counting solutions and each period contains exactly one solution where $\\tan y = y$, we need to consider if there's a partial period at the end that might contain an additional solution.\n\n## Step 7: Accounting for the initial solution at $y = 0$\nWe must remember that $y = 0$ (or $x = 0$) is also a solution to $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ because $\\tan 0 = 0$ and $\\tan (\\tan 0) = \\tan 0 = 0$. This means we have at least one solution before we even start counting periods of $\\pi$.\n\n## Step 8: Final calculation\nNow, let's calculate. The number of periods of $\\pi$ that fit within $0$ to $942$ can be found by dividing $942$ by $\\pi$. However, since we know there's a solution at $y = 0$, we should add $1$ to whatever result we get from dividing $942$ by $\\pi$ to account for this initial solution.\n\n## Step 9: Calculation\n$942 / \\pi \\approx 299.77$. Since each full period of $\\pi$ contains one solution, and we have a fraction of a period left, we round down to $299$ full periods because the partial period at the end doesn't contain a full cycle of $\\tan y$. Then, adding $1$ for the solution at $y = 0$, we get $299 + 1 = 300$ solutions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{300}$"
