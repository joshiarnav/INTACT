    "## Step 1: Identify the restrictions on the domain of the function\nThe function $y=\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ has restrictions due to the square root and the logarithm. The expression under the square root, $\\cos x$, must be non-negative, and the argument of the logarithm, $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$, must be strictly greater than 0.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the range of $\\cos x$ for $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$\nGiven $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$, $\\cos x$ ranges from 0 to 1, excluding 0, because at $x = -90^\\circ$ or $x = 90^\\circ$, $\\cos x = 0$, but these endpoints are not included in the given interval.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the range of $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$\nSince $\\cos x$ ranges from 0 to 1 (excluding 0), $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$ also ranges from 0 to 1, excluding 0. Thus, $0 < \\sqrt{\\cos x} \\leq 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the range of $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$\nThe function $\\log_2 x$ is defined for $x > 0$ and ranges from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$. Given that $0 < \\sqrt{\\cos x} \\leq 1$, $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ will range from $-\\infty$ to $\\log_2 (1)$, which is 0, because $\\log_2 (1) = 0$. Therefore, the range of the function $y=\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ for $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$ is all non-positive numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(-\\infty,0]}$",
    "## Step 1: Understanding the given function and its domain\nThe function given is $y=\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$, and the domain specified is $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$. This means we are dealing with a logarithmic function that involves the square root of the cosine of $x$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the cosine function within the given domain\nThe cosine function, $\\cos x$, is positive for all $x$ in the interval $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$. At $x = 0^\\circ$, $\\cos x = 1$, and as $x$ approaches $-90^\\circ$ or $90^\\circ$, $\\cos x$ approaches $0$.\n\n## Step 3: Considering the square root of the cosine function\nSince $\\cos x$ is positive in the given domain, $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$ is defined for all $x$ in $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$. The maximum value of $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$ is $1$ (when $x = 0^\\circ$), and the minimum value approaches $0$ as $x$ approaches $-90^\\circ$ or $90^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing the logarithmic function\nThe function $y = \\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ involves taking the base-2 logarithm of $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$. Since $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$ ranges from $0$ (exclusive) to $1$ (inclusive) within the given domain, we need to consider the range of the logarithmic function for this range of inputs.\n\n## Step 5: Determining the range of the logarithmic function\nThe logarithm $\\log_2 x$ is defined for $x > 0$. When $x$ approaches $0$ from the right, $\\log_2 x$ approaches $-\\infty$. When $x = 1$, $\\log_2 x = 0$. Therefore, for the input range $0 < \\sqrt{\\cos x} \\leq 1$, the output of $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ ranges from $-\\infty$ to $0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(-\\infty,0]}$",
    "## Step 1: Understanding the function and its restrictions\nThe given function is $y=\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$. For this function to be defined, the expression inside the square root must be non-negative, and the argument of the logarithm must be strictly greater than 0. This means $\\cos x \\geq 0$ and $\\sqrt{\\cos x} > 0$. Since $\\cos x$ is non-negative in the interval $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$, we need to ensure $\\cos x > 0$ because the square root of a number is greater than 0 only if the number itself is greater than 0.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the cosine function within the given interval\nThe cosine function is positive in the first and fourth quadrants, which corresponds to the interval $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$. However, within this interval, $\\cos x$ ranges from 0 to 1. When $x = 0^\\circ$, $\\cos x = 1$, and as $x$ approaches $-90^\\circ$ or $90^\\circ$, $\\cos x$ approaches 0.\n\n## Step 3: Determining the range of $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$\nGiven that $0 < \\cos x \\leq 1$ for $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$, the range of $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$ will be $0 < \\sqrt{\\cos x} \\leq 1$ because the square root of a number between 0 and 1 is also between 0 and 1.\n\n## Step 4: Finding the range of $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$\nThe logarithm function $\\log_2 x$ is defined for $x > 0$, and it increases as $x$ increases. Since $0 < \\sqrt{\\cos x} \\leq 1$, $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ will range from $\\log_2 1$ down to negative infinity because $\\log_2 x$ approaches $-\\infty$ as $x$ approaches 0. $\\log_2 1 = 0$ because any base raised to the power of 0 equals 1.\n\n## Step 5: Concluding the range of the function\nThe range of the function $y=\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ for $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$ is all non-positive numbers, since $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ can get arbitrarily close to $-\\infty$ but will not exceed 0.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(-\\infty,0]}$"
