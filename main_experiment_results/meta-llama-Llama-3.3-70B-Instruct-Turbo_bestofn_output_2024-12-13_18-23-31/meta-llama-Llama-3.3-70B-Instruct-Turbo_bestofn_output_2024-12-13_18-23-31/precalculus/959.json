    "## Step 1: Determine the direction vector of the line\nTo find the direction vector of the line passing through points $(3,4,1)$ and $(5,1,6)$, we subtract the coordinates of the first point from the coordinates of the second point. The direction vector \\(\\vec{v} = (5-3, 1-4, 6-1) = (2, -3, 5)\\).\n\n## Step 2: Write the parametric equations of the line\nUsing the point-slope form of the line in 3D space, with the point \\((3,4,1)\\) and the direction vector \\(\\vec{v} = (2, -3, 5)\\), the parametric equations of the line can be written as:\n\\[x = 3 + 2t\\]\n\\[y = 4 - 3t\\]\n\\[z = 1 + 5t\\]\nwhere \\(t\\) is the parameter.\n\n## Step 3: Find the intersection point with the xy-plane\nThe xy-plane is defined by \\(z = 0\\). To find where the line intersects the xy-plane, we set \\(z = 0\\) in the parametric equation for \\(z\\) and solve for \\(t\\):\n\\[0 = 1 + 5t\\]\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\\[-1 = 5t\\]\nDivide by 5:\n\\[t = -\\frac{1}{5}\\]\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the x and y coordinates of the intersection point\nSubstitute \\(t = -\\frac{1}{5}\\) into the parametric equations for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n\\[x = 3 + 2\\left(-\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 3 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{15}{5} - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{13}{5}\\]\n\\[y = 4 - 3\\left(-\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 4 + \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{20}{5} + \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{23}{5}\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{13}{5}, \\frac{23}{5}, 0\\right)}$",
