    "## Step 1: Define the problem and understand what is being asked.\nWe need to find the number of real solutions to the equation \\(\\frac{x}{100} = \\sin x\\). This involves analyzing the intersection points of the graphs of \\(y = \\frac{x}{100}\\) and \\(y = \\sin x\\), as each intersection represents a solution to the equation.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the properties of the two functions involved.\nThe function \\(y = \\frac{x}{100}\\) is a linear function with a slope of \\(\\frac{1}{100}\\), passing through the origin. The function \\(y = \\sin x\\) is a periodic trigonometric function with a period of \\(2\\pi\\), and its range is \\([-1, 1]\\).\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the behavior of \\(y = \\sin x\\) in relation to \\(y = \\frac{x}{100}\\).\nGiven that \\(-1 \\leq \\sin x \\leq 1\\), the values of \\(x\\) for which \\(\\frac{x}{100}\\) is within the range \\([-1, 1]\\) are \\(-100 \\leq x \\leq 100\\). Beyond this range, \\(\\frac{x}{100}\\) will be outside the range of \\(\\sin x\\), and thus no solutions exist outside \\(-100 \\leq x \\leq 100\\).\n\n## Step 4: Determine the maximum number of solutions within one period of \\(\\sin x\\).\nWithin one period of \\(\\sin x\\), i.e., \\(2\\pi\\), and considering the gentle slope of \\(y = \\frac{x}{100}\\), there can be at most two intersections (solutions) because the linear function \\(y = \\frac{x}{100}\\) can intersect the sinusoidal curve \\(y = \\sin x\\) at two points within one period due to its convexity and concavity.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the approximate number of periods of \\(\\sin x\\) within the relevant range.\nThe relevant range for \\(x\\) is \\(-100 \\leq x \\leq 100\\). Given that one period of \\(\\sin x\\) is \\(2\\pi\\), the number of complete periods within this range is approximately \\(\\frac{200}{2\\pi} \\approx 31.83\\). However, since we're interested in the total number of solutions, including those that might occur at the edges of this range, we consider the entire range and the fact that solutions occur in pairs within each period due to symmetry.\n\n## Step 6: Account for solutions at the origin and the nature of \\(\\sin x\\).\nThe origin (0,0) is a solution since \\(\\frac{0}{100} = \\sin 0 = 0\\). For each period of \\(\\sin x\\) within the range, due to the symmetry and periodic nature of \\(\\sin x\\), and considering the linear function's slope, there will be a pair of solutions (one positive, one negative) for each half-cycle of \\(\\sin x\\) that intersects the line.\n\n## Step 7: Estimate the total number of solutions based on the analysis.\nGiven the approximation of 31.83 periods, and knowing that within each period there are two intersections (one positive and one negative solution) due to the shape of \\(\\sin x\\) and the linearity of \\(\\frac{x}{100}\\), we estimate around 63 solutions (31 positive and 31 negative, plus the solution at the origin). However, this is an approximation and the exact number may vary slightly due to the endpoints and the exact nature of the intersection points.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{63}$",
    "## Step 1: Understanding the equation\nThe equation provided is $\\frac{x}{100} = \\sin x$. This equation involves both a linear component $\\frac{x}{100}$ and a trigonometric component $\\sin x$. The linear component is a straight line with a slope of $\\frac{1}{100}$, and the trigonometric component oscillates between -1 and 1.\n\n## Step 2: Identifying the range of sin(x)\nThe range of $\\sin x$ is $[-1, 1]$. This means that for the equation $\\frac{x}{100} = \\sin x$ to have real solutions, $\\frac{x}{100}$ must also be within the range $[-1, 1]$. Therefore, $-100 \\leq x \\leq 100$.\n\n## Step 3: Visualizing the graphs\nBy visualizing or graphing $\\frac{x}{100}$ and $\\sin x$ over the interval $[-100, 100]$, we can see that the straight line $\\frac{x}{100}$ intersects the sine wave $\\sin x$ at multiple points. These intersection points represent the solutions to the equation.\n\n## Step 4: Determining the number of intersections\nGiven the periodic nature of $\\sin x$ and the linear increase of $\\frac{x}{100}$, the graphs intersect each other once in each interval where $\\sin x$ completes a full cycle (i.e., $2\\pi$ radians or $360^\\circ$), except possibly at the ends of the interval $[-100, 100]$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the number of cycles of sin(x) in the interval\nSince $\\sin x$ has a period of $2\\pi$, the number of complete cycles of $\\sin x$ within the interval $[-100, 100]$ can be estimated by calculating $\\frac{200}{2\\pi}$, as the total span is 200 units (from -100 to 100).\n\n## Step 6: Estimating the number of solutions\nEach cycle of $\\sin x$ intersects the line $\\frac{x}{100}$ twice (once going up and once going down), except for the first and last cycles which might only intersect once depending on where they start and end in relation to the line. However, because the slope of the line $\\frac{x}{100}$ is gentle compared to the oscillations of $\\sin x$, and considering the interval $[-100, 100]$, we expect intersections in each cycle of $\\sin x$ without exceptions at the ends.\n\n## Step 7: Accounting for solutions at the ends\nGiven that the line $\\frac{x}{100}$ is nearly flat compared to the $\\sin x$ curve, and the fact that $\\sin x$ starts and ends the interval $[-100, 100]$ within the range where intersections can occur, we need to consider if there are additional solutions at the very beginning or end of the interval that might not be accounted for in the cycle count.\n\n## Step 8: Finalizing the solution count\nThe number of solutions can be approximated by considering the number of cycles of $\\sin x$ within the interval $[-100, 100]$ and recognizing that each cycle typically contributes two intersections. However, the exact count must consider the specific behavior of $\\sin x$ and the line $\\frac{x}{100}$ at the boundaries of the interval.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{63}$",
    "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe given equation is $\\frac{x}{100} = \\sin x.$ We need to find the number of real solutions for this equation.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the range of sin(x)\nThe sine function $\\sin x$ ranges from $-1$ to $1$. Therefore, for the equation $\\frac{x}{100} = \\sin x$ to have real solutions, $\\frac{x}{100}$ must also be within the range $-1$ to $1$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the range of x\nTo find the range of $x$ where real solutions exist, we solve the inequality $-1 \\leq \\frac{x}{100} \\leq 1$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$ gives $-100 \\leq x \\leq 100$.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the periodic nature of sin(x)\nThe sine function is periodic with a period of $2\\pi$. This means that the graph of $\\sin x$ repeats every $2\\pi$ units. Within one period, the sine function goes from $0$ to $1$ to $-1$ and back to $0$. Given the range $-100 \\leq x \\leq 100$, we need to consider how many periods of $2\\pi$ fit within this range to estimate the number of solutions.\n\n## Step 5: Estimate the number of solutions within the range\nSince the sine function crosses the line $y = \\frac{x}{100}$ twice in each period of $2\\pi$ (once going up and once going down) and the total range is $200$ units wide, we can estimate the number of periods that fit within this range. The width of the range is $200$, and each period is approximately $6.28$ units wide ($2\\pi$). However, because the line $y = \\frac{x}{100}$ is very gradual compared to the oscillations of $\\sin x$, and considering the endpoints, we expect more than just $2$ solutions per period due to the line intersecting the sine wave more frequently as it oscillates.\n\n## Step 6: Account for solutions at the endpoints and the central region\nAt $x = 0$, $\\sin x = 0$, and $\\frac{x}{100} = 0$, so $x = 0$ is a solution. For the gradual slope of $\\frac{x}{100}$, it will intersect each peak and trough of the sine wave within the range $-100$ to $100$. Given the sine wave's periodicity and the fact that its peaks and troughs are at $1$ and $-1$, respectively, and the line $\\frac{x}{100}$ is gentle, we expect intersections near each extremum of the sine wave within the range where $\\frac{x}{100}$ is between $-1$ and $1$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the approximate number of periods within the range\nThe range from $-100$ to $100$ is $200$ units wide. Each period of $\\sin x$ is $2\\pi \\approx 6.28$ units. Thus, the number of periods within the range is approximately $200 / (2\\pi) \\approx 31.83$ periods. Given that each period can contain two intersections (one going up and one going down), and considering the behavior at the edges and the center, we can estimate the number of solutions.\n\n## Step 8: Final estimation\nHowever, the exact number of solutions must consider the specific intersections and cannot be solely based on the number of periods due to the line's gentle slope intersecting the sine wave's peaks and troughs. The line $y = \\frac{x}{100}$ will intersect the sine wave in each period where the sine wave's value is between $-1$ and $1$, but the precise count must account for the start and end points of the range and the behavior near $x = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{63}$"
