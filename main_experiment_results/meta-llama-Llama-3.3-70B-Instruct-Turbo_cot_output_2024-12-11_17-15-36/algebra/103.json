    "solution": "We only need to worry about the terms that multiply to have a degree of $2$. This would be given by the product of the terms $3x^2$ and $-4$ as well as the product of the terms $-2x$ and $-7x$. Thus, $$(3x^2) \\times (-4) + (-2x) \\times (-7x) = -12x^2 + 14x^2 = 2x^2,$$and the coefficient is $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion of the given product, we first need to expand the product using the distributive property.\nThe product given is $(ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)(bx^2 - 7x - 4)$. We will multiply each term of the first polynomial by each term of the second polynomial.\n\n## Step 2: Multiply each term of the first polynomial by each term of the second polynomial.\n- Multiplying $ax^3$ by $bx^2$ gives $abx^5$.\n- Multiplying $ax^3$ by $-7x$ gives $-7ax^4$.\n- Multiplying $ax^3$ by $-4$ gives $-4ax^3$.\n- Multiplying $3x^2$ by $bx^2$ gives $3bx^4$.\n- Multiplying $3x^2$ by $-7x$ gives $-21x^3$.\n- Multiplying $3x^2$ by $-4$ gives $-12x^2$.\n- Multiplying $-2x$ by $bx^2$ gives $-2bx^3$.\n- Multiplying $-2x$ by $-7x$ gives $14x^2$.\n- Multiplying $-2x$ by $-4$ gives $8x$.\n\n## Step 3: Combine like terms from the results of the multiplication.\nCombining all the terms we got from multiplying:\n- $abx^5$ (no like terms)\n- $-7ax^4$ and $3bx^4$ (combine to get $(-7a + 3b)x^4$)\n- $-4ax^3$, $-21x^3$, and $-2bx^3$ (combine to get $(-4a - 21 - 2b)x^3$)\n- $-12x^2$ and $14x^2$ (combine to get $2x^2$)\n- $8x$ (no like terms)\n\n## Step 4: Identify the coefficient of the $x^2$ term from the combined terms.\nFrom the combined terms, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is the number multiplying $x^2$, which is $2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
