    "problem": "What is the greatest integer $n$ such that $n^2 - 11n +24 \\leq 0$?",
    "solution": "We can factor $n^2-11n+24$ as $(n-3)(n-8)$. For this quantity to be less than or equal to 0, one of the factors must be less than or equal to 0 and the other factor must be greater than or equal to 0. Specifically, since $n-8<n-3$ for all $n$, we must have $$n-8 \\le 0 \\le n-3.$$ The first inequality, $n-8\\le 0$, tells us that $n\\le 8$. The second inequality, $0\\le n-3$, tells us that $n\\ge 3$. The solutions to the original inequality must satisfy both conditions, so they are given by $3\\le n\\le 8$. The largest integer in this interval is $n=\\boxed{8}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given inequality\nThe given inequality is $n^2 - 11n + 24 \\leq 0$. We need to find the greatest integer $n$ that satisfies this inequality.\n\n## Step 2: Factorize the quadratic expression\nTo solve the inequality, let's first factorize the quadratic expression $n^2 - 11n + 24$. It can be factored as $(n - 8)(n - 3)$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the inequality with the factorized expression\nNow, we rewrite the inequality using the factorized form: $(n - 8)(n - 3) \\leq 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the critical points\nThe critical points are the values of $n$ where $(n - 8)(n - 3) = 0$. Setting each factor equal to zero gives us $n = 8$ and $n = 3$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the sign of the expression in the intervals defined by the critical points\nWe have three intervals to consider: $(-\\infty, 3)$, $(3, 8)$, and $(8, \\infty)$. For $n < 3$, both $(n - 8)$ and $(n - 3)$ are negative, so their product is positive. For $3 < n < 8$, $(n - 8)$ is negative and $(n - 3)$ is positive, so the product is negative. For $n > 8$, both factors are positive, making the product positive again.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the interval where the inequality holds true\nThe inequality $(n - 8)(n - 3) \\leq 0$ holds true when the product is negative or zero, which occurs in the interval $3 \\leq n \\leq 8$.\n\n## Step 7: Find the greatest integer $n$ within this interval\nSince we are looking for the greatest integer $n$ that satisfies the inequality, we consider the upper bound of the interval, which is $8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
