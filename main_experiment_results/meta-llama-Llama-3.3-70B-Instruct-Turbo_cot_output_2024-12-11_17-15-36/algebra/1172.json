    "solution": "Since we know that $f(x)=x^2+1$ and $g(x)=2x-1$, the expression for $f(g(x))$ is just $(2x-1)^2+1$. From here, we can just plug 5 in as the value for $x$. \\begin{align*} (f(g(5))&=(2(5)-1)^2+1\n\\\\ &=(10-1)^2+1\n\\\\ &=(9)^2+1\n\\\\ &=81+1\n\\\\ &=\\boxed{82}\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "To find $f(g(5))$, we first need to calculate $g(5)$ and then use the result as the input for $f(x)$.\n\nStep 1: Calculate $g(5)$.\nGiven $g(x) = 2x - 1$, substituting $x = 5$ into $g(x)$ gives us:\n$g(5) = 2(5) - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9$.\n\nStep 2: Calculate $f(g(5))$.\nNow that we know $g(5) = 9$, we substitute $x = 9$ into $f(x) = x^2 + 1$:\n$f(9) = 9^2 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82$.\n\nTherefore, $f(g(5)) = 82$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{82}$"
