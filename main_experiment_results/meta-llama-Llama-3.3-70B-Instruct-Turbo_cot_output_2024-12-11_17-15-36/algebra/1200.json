    "solution": "First, we find an expression for $h(x)$.  From our definition of $h$, we have $h(4y-1) = 2y+7$.  So, if we let $x=4y-1$, so that $y = (x+1)/4$, we have  \\[h(x) = 2\\cdot\\frac{x+1}{4} + 7 = \\frac{x+1}{2} + 7.\\] Setting this equal to $x$ gives \\[x =\\frac{x+1}{2} + 7.\\] Multiplying both sides by 2 gives $2x = x+1 + 14$, so $x = \\boxed{15}$.",

To find $h(x)$, we need to express the given function in terms of $x$.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute a variable to represent the input of $h$\nLet $u = 4x - 1$. This means $x = \\frac{u+1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 3: Express $h(u)$ using the substitution\nSubstitute $x = \\frac{u+1}{4}$ into the equation $h(4x-1) = 2x + 7$ to get $h(u) = 2(\\frac{u+1}{4}) + 7$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify $h(u)$\nSimplify the equation to get $h(u) = \\frac{u+1}{2} + 7 = \\frac{u+1}{2} + \\frac{14}{2} = \\frac{u+15}{2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Express $h(x)$\nNow that we have $h(u)$, we can express $h(x)$ by replacing $u$ with $x$, resulting in $h(x) = \\frac{x+15}{2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $x$ when $h(x) = x$\nSet $h(x) = x$ and solve for $x$: $\\frac{x+15}{2} = x$.\n\n## Step 7: Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives $x + 15 = 2x$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $x$\nSubtract $x$ from both sides to get $15 = x$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
