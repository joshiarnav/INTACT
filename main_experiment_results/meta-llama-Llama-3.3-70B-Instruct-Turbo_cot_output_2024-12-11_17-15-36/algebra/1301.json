    "problem": "Phoenix hiked the Rocky Path Trail last week. It took four days to complete the trip. The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles. The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day. The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles. The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles. How many miles long was the trail?",
    "solution": "Let the number of miles Phoenix hiked in each day be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=22\\\\\n(b+c)/2=13 \\Rightarrow b+c&=26\\\\\nc+d&=30\\\\\na+c&=26\n\\end{align*} Notice that we do not have to solve for any of the variables. We can add $a + b = 22$ to $c + d = 30$ and find that $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52.$ Therefore, the entire trail was $\\boxed{52}$ miles long.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the variables for each day's hike\nLet's denote the miles hiked on the first day as $a$, the second day as $b$, the third day as $c$, and the fourth day as $d$.\n\n## Step 2: Translate the given information into equations\nFrom the problem, we have the following information:\n1. The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles: $a + b = 22$\n2. The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day: $(b + c) / 2 = 13$, which simplifies to $b + c = 26$\n3. The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles: $c + d = 30$\n4. The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles: $a + c = 26$\n\n## Step 3: Solve the system of equations\nWe can solve these equations to find the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\nFirst, from equation 1, we can express $a$ in terms of $b$: $a = 22 - b$.\nSecond, from equation 4, we can express $a$ in terms of $c$: $a = 26 - c$.\nEquating these two expressions for $a$ gives $22 - b = 26 - c$, which simplifies to $c - b = 4$.\nFrom equation 2, we have $b + c = 26$. Adding this to $c - b = 4$ gives $2c = 30$, so $c = 15$.\nSubstituting $c = 15$ into $c - b = 4$ gives $15 - b = 4$, so $b = 11$.\nThen, substituting $b = 11$ into $a + b = 22$ gives $a + 11 = 22$, so $a = 11$.\nFinally, substituting $c = 15$ into $c + d = 30$ gives $15 + d = 30$, so $d = 15$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total length of the trail\nThe total length of the trail is the sum of the miles hiked each day: $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{52}$"
