    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the problem as a sum of a geometric series\nThe given expression is a sum of a geometric series with the first term as $\\frac{1}{3^{1}}$ and the common ratio as $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series\nThe sum $S_n$ of the first $n$ terms of a geometric series is given by the formula: $S_n = \\frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}$, where $a$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the formula to the given series\nHere, $a = \\frac{1}{3}$, $r = \\frac{1}{3}$, and $n = 6$. Plugging these values into the formula gives us $S_6 = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^6)}{1 - \\frac{1}{3}}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying the denominator first, we get $1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$. Thus, the expression becomes $S_6 = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^6)}{\\frac{2}{3}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Further simplify the expression\nWe can simplify this by multiplying the numerator and dividing by $\\frac{2}{3}$, which is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal $\\frac{3}{2}$. This gives $S_6 = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - (\\frac{1}{3})^6)$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $(\\frac{1}{3})^6$\n$(\\frac{1}{3})^6 = \\frac{1}{729}$.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute back into the expression\nSubstituting $\\frac{1}{729}$ back into the expression gives $S_6 = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\frac{1}{729})$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the expression inside the parentheses\n$1 - \\frac{1}{729} = \\frac{728}{729}$.\n\n## Step 9: Multiply by $\\frac{1}{2}$\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{728}{729} = \\frac{364}{729}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{364}{729}}$"
