    "model_solution": "To find the value of $6 \\# 2$, we need to substitute $a = 6$ and $b = 2$ into the given operation $a \\# b = a + \\frac{a}{b}$.\n\n## Step 1: Substitute the values of $a$ and $b$ into the operation.\nWe have $a = 6$ and $b = 2$, so $6 \\# 2 = 6 + \\frac{6}{2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Perform the arithmetic to simplify the expression.\nNow, we calculate $6 + \\frac{6}{2}$. First, we find $\\frac{6}{2} = 3$.\n\n## Step 3: Add the results of the division to $6$.\nThen, we add $6 + 3 = 9$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$"
