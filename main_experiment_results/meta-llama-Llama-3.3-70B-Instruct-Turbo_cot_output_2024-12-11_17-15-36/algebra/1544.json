    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Factor out 1000 from 2744000\nFirst, we notice that 2744000 has a factor of 1000, which is $10^3$. Factoring this out gives us $\\sqrt[3]{2744000} = \\sqrt[3]{1000 \\times 2744}$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the cube root of 1000\nSince $1000 = 10^3$, the cube root of 1000 is simply 10. So, we can rewrite our expression as $10\\sqrt[3]{2744}$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the prime factorization of 2744\nTo simplify $\\sqrt[3]{2744}$, let's find the prime factorization of 2744. We start by dividing 2744 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by prime numbers until we cannot divide anymore.\n\n## Step 4: Prime factorization of 2744\n2744 is even, so we start by dividing by 2: $2744 = 2 \\times 1372$. Continuing, $1372 = 2 \\times 686$, $686 = 2 \\times 343$, and $343 = 7^3$. So, $2744 = 2^3 \\times 7^3$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the cube root of 2744\nNow that we have the prime factorization of 2744 as $2^3 \\times 7^3$, we can simplify the cube root: $\\sqrt[3]{2744} = \\sqrt[3]{2^3 \\times 7^3} = 2 \\times 7 = 14$.\n\n## Step 6: Combine the simplified cube root with the factor 10\nCombining the simplified cube root of 2744 with the factor 10 from the cube root of 1000, we get $10 \\times 14 = 140$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{140}$"
