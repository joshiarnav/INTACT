    "solution": "We begin by expressing both sides of the equation in terms of the base 2: $(3^3)^8=(3^2)^q$, which simplifies to $3^{24}=3^{2q}$. Setting the exponents equal to each other, $24=2q$, or $q=\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Express both sides of the equation with the same base\nWe can rewrite $27^8$ and $9^q$ with base $3$ since $27 = 3^3$ and $9 = 3^2$. This gives us $(3^3)^8 = (3^2)^q$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply exponent rules to simplify\nUsing the rule $(a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}$, we simplify both sides to get $3^{3 \\cdot 8} = 3^{2 \\cdot q}$, which further simplifies to $3^{24} = 3^{2q}$.\n\n## Step 3: Set the exponents equal to each other\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other: $24 = 2q$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $q$\nTo find $q$, divide both sides of the equation by $2$: $q = 24 / 2$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $q$\nPerform the division to find $q$: $q = 12$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
