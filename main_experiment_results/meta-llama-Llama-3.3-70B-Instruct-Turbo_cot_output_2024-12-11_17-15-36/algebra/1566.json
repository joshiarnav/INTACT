    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the series\nThe given series is an arithmetic series where each term increases by 1. It starts from 1 and ends at 49.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of terms\nTo find the number of terms in the series, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is given by: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the number of terms, and $d$ is the common difference. Here, $a_1 = 1$, $a_n = 49$, and $d = 1$. Plugging these values into the formula gives $49 = 1 + (n-1)1$. Solving for $n$, we get $n = 49$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the sum of the series\nThe sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the nth term. Substituting the known values, we get $S_{49} = \\frac{49}{2}(1 + 49)$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying the expression inside the parentheses first, we have $1 + 49 = 50$. Then, $\\frac{49}{2} \\times 50 = \\frac{49 \\times 50}{2} = \\frac{2450}{2} = 1225$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1225}$"
