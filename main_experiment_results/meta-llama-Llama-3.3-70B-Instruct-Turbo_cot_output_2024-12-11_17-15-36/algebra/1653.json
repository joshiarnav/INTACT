    "problem": "A triangular region is bounded by the two coordinate axes and the line given by the equation $2x + y = 6$. What is the area of the region, in square units?",
    "solution": "To start, use the equation to solve for the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the line.  Letting $x$ equal 0, the $y$-intercept is 6.  Letting $y$ equal 0, we find that $2x=6$ so the $x$-intercept is 3.  Using the intercepts, we can graph the line as shown: [asy]size(100,0);\nfill((0,0)--(0,6)--(3,0)--cycle,gray(.7));\nadd(grid(5,8));\ndraw((0,0)--(5,0),linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,8),linewidth(2));\nlabel(\"\",(5,0),E);\nlabel(\"\",(0,8),N);\ndraw((0,6)--(3,0),blue,Arrows);[/asy] We wish to find the area of the shaded region.  This is a right triangle with one base of length 3, and one of length 6.  Therefore, the area is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3\\cdot 6=\\boxed{9}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the equation of the line and its intercepts\nThe equation given is $2x + y = 6$. To find the x-intercept, we set $y = 0$ and solve for $x$. This gives $2x = 6$, which simplifies to $x = 3$. For the y-intercept, we set $x = 0$ and solve for $y$, which gives $y = 6$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the vertices of the triangular region\nThe x and y intercepts of the line $2x + y = 6$ give us two vertices of the triangle: $(3, 0)$ and $(0, 6)$. The third vertex is the origin, $(0, 0)$, since the region is bounded by the two coordinate axes.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area of the triangular region\nThe area $A$ of a triangle is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. In this case, we can consider the base of the triangle to be the distance from the origin to the x-intercept (which is 3 units), and the height to be the distance from the origin to the y-intercept (which is 6 units).\n\n## Step 4: Apply the formula to find the area\nSubstituting the base and height into the area formula gives $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 6 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 18 = 9$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$"
