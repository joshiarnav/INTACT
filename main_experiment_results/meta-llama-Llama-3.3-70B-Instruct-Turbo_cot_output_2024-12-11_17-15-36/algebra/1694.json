    "problem": "A puppy and two cats together weigh 24 pounds. The puppy and the larger cat together weigh exactly twice as much as the smaller cat, and the puppy and the smaller cat together weigh exactly the same as the larger cat. How many pounds does the puppy weigh?",
    "solution": "Let the weight of the puppy be $a$, the weight of the smaller cat be $b$, and the weight of the larger cat be $c$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c&=24\\\\\na+c&=2b\\\\\na+b&=c\n\\end{align*} From Equation (2), we have $a=2b-c$. Substituting that into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b+c=24 \\Rightarrow b=8\n\\end{align*} Substituting $a=2b-c$ into Equation (3) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b&=c \\Rightarrow 3b=2c\n\\end{align*} Since $b=8$, $c=\\frac{3}{2}b=12$. Finally, substituting the values of $b$ and $c$ into Equation (1) to solve for $a$, we have $a+8+12=24$, or $a=4$. Thus, the puppy weighs $\\boxed{4}$ pounds.",

    "model_solution": "Let's denote the weight of the puppy as \\(P\\), the weight of the larger cat as \\(L\\), and the weight of the smaller cat as \\(S\\).\n\nFrom the information given, we have three key pieces of information:\n1. The puppy and two cats together weigh 24 pounds: \\(P + L + S = 24\\)\n2. The puppy and the larger cat together weigh exactly twice as much as the smaller cat: \\(P + L = 2S\\)\n3. The puppy and the smaller cat together weigh exactly the same as the larger cat: \\(P + S = L\\)\n\nLet's solve these equations step by step.\n\nFirst, from equation (3), we can express \\(L\\) in terms of \\(P\\) and \\(S\\): \\(L = P + S\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(L = P + S\\) into equation (2), we get: \\(P + (P + S) = 2S\\), which simplifies to \\(2P + S = 2S\\), and further simplifies to \\(2P = S\\).\n\nNow, substituting \\(L = P + S\\) and \\(S = 2P\\) into the first equation \\(P + L + S = 24\\), we get: \\(P + (P + S) + S = 24\\). Since \\(S = 2P\\), this becomes \\(P + (P + 2P) + 2P = 24\\), which simplifies to \\(P + 3P + 2P = 24\\), and further simplifies to \\(6P = 24\\).\n\nDividing both sides by 6 gives \\(P = 4\\).\n\nTherefore, the puppy weighs \\(\\boxed{4}\\) pounds."
