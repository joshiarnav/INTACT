    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the midpoint of the line segment from $(2,5)$ to $(4,9)$, we use the midpoint formula.\nThe midpoint formula is given by $(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2})$. Applying this formula to the given points, we get $(\\frac{2 + 4}{2}, \\frac{5 + 9}{2}) = (3, 7)$.\n\n## Step 2: Since the line $x+y=b$ intersects the line segment at its midpoint, the coordinates of the midpoint must satisfy the equation of the line.\nWe substitute $x = 3$ and $y = 7$ into the equation $x + y = b$ to find the value of $b$. Therefore, $3 + 7 = b$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the value of $b$.\n$b = 3 + 7 = 10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
