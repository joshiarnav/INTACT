This involves squaring numbers and then dividing by 14.\n\n## Step 2: Notice the difference of squares\nRecognize that $235^2 - 221^2$ is a difference of squares, which can be factored into $(235+221)(235-221)$ according to the formula $a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the difference of squares formula\nApply the formula to get $(235+221)(235-221)$. This simplifies to $456 \\times 14$.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute the result back into the original expression\nSubstitute $456 \\times 14$ back into the original expression to get $\\displaystyle\\frac{456 \\times 14}{14}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression\nNotice that 14 is in both the numerator and the denominator, so they cancel out, leaving just $456$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{456}$"
