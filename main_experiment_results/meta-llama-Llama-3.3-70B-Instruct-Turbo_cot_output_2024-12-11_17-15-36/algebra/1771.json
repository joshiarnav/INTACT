    "problem": "Two parabolas are the graphs of the equations $y=2x^2-7x+1$ and $y=8x^2+5x+1$. Give all points where they intersect.  List the points in order of increasing $x$-coordinate, separated by semicolons.",
    "solution": "First, set the two equations equal to each other to get $2x^2-7x+1=8x^2+5x+1$. Combine like terms to get $6x^2+12x=0$. Then, we can divide by $6$ to get $x^2+2x=0$. To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{2}\\right)^2=1$ to both sides, giving $(x+1)^2=1$.\n\nSo we have $x+1=\\pm1$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x=-2$ or $0$. Using these in our original parabolas, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-2, 23)}$ and $\\boxed{(0, 1)}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the intersection points of the two parabolas, we need to set their equations equal to each other.\nWe have the equations $y=2x^2-7x+1$ and $y=8x^2+5x+1$. Setting them equal gives $2x^2-7x+1 = 8x^2+5x+1$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the equation by combining like terms.\nSubtract $2x^2$ from both sides to get $-7x+1 = 6x^2+5x+1$. Then subtract $1$ from both sides to get $-7x = 6x^2+5x$. Subtract $5x$ from both sides to get $-12x = 6x^2$. Finally, subtract $6x^2$ from both sides to get $0 = 6x^2+12x$.\n\n## Step 3: Factor out $6x$ from the equation $0 = 6x^2+12x$.\nFactoring out $6x$ gives $0 = 6x(x+2)$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $x$ in the equation $0 = 6x(x+2)$.\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives $6x = 0$ and $x+2 = 0$. Solving these gives $x = 0$ and $x = -2$.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute the $x$ values back into one of the original equations to find the corresponding $y$ values.\nFor $x = 0$, using $y=2x^2-7x+1$, we get $y = 2(0)^2 - 7(0) + 1 = 1$. For $x = -2$, we get $y = 2(-2)^2 - 7(-2) + 1 = 8 + 14 + 1 = 23$.\n\n## Step 6: Write down the intersection points in the required format.\nThe points of intersection, listed in order of increasing $x$-coordinate, are $(-2, 23); (0, 1)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(-2, 23); (0, 1)}$"
