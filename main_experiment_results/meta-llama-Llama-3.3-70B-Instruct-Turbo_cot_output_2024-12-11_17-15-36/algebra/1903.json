    "solution": "In order to find $\\log_{625} x$, we must first find $x$. We begin by writing $\\log_9 (x-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$ in exponential form, which gives us $9^{\\frac12}=x-2$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=9^{\\frac12}+2=3+2=5$. After plugging this value of $x$ into the second expression, the final step is to find $\\log_{625} 5$. Since we know that $625=5^4$ or $625^{\\frac14}=5$, $\\log_{625} 5=\\boxed{\\frac14}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the goal\nThe given equation is $\\log_9 (x-2) = \\frac{1}{2}$, and we need to find $\\log_{625} x$. This involves solving the given logarithmic equation for $x$ and then finding the logarithm of $x$ with base 625.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the given logarithmic equation for $x$\nTo solve $\\log_9 (x-2) = \\frac{1}{2}$, we convert the logarithmic equation into its exponential form: $9^{\\frac{1}{2}} = x - 2$. Since $9^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 3$, we have $3 = x - 2$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $x$\nAdding 2 to both sides of the equation $3 = x - 2$ gives $x = 5$.\n\n## Step 4: Find $\\log_{625} x$\nNow that we know $x = 5$, we need to find $\\log_{625} 5$. Recognizing that $625 = 5^4$, we can use the property of logarithms $\\log_a a = 1$ and the change of base formula to simplify this.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the change of base formula or recognize the logarithm property\nSince $625 = 5^4$, $\\log_{625} 5$ can be thought of as asking \"to what power must 625 be raised to get 5?\" Given $625 = 5^4$, it's clear that $625^{\\frac{1}{4}} = 5$. Thus, $\\log_{625} 5 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$"
