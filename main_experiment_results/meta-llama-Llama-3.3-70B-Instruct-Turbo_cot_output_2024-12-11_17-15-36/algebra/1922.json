    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Expand the first term of the expression\nThe first term is $3(x - 4)$. Expanding this gives $3x - 12$.\n\n## Step 2: Expand the second term of the expression\nThe second term is $4(7 - 2x^2 + 5x)$. Expanding this gives $28 - 8x^2 + 20x$.\n\n## Step 3: Expand the third term of the expression\nThe third term is $-8(2x - 1)$. Expanding this gives $-16x + 8$.\n\n## Step 4: Combine all the expanded terms into a single expression\nCombining all the terms gives $3x - 12 + 28 - 8x^2 + 20x - 16x + 8$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression by combining like terms\nSimplifying the expression, we combine like terms: $3x + 20x - 16x$ for the $x$ terms, $-12 + 28 + 8$ for the constants, and $-8x^2$ remains as is. This simplifies to $7x - 8x^2 + 24$.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the coefficient of $x$ in the simplified expression\nThe coefficient of $x$ in the simplified expression $7x - 8x^2 + 24$ is $7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
