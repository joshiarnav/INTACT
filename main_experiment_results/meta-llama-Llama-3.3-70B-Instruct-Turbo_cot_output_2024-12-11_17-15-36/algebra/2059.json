    "solution": "We can have $\\log_{10}10=1$ and $\\log_{10}100=2$.  Since $\\log_{10}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\\log_{10}10<\\log_{10}17<\\log_{10}100$, meaning $1<\\log_{10}17<2$.  Thus, the desired sum is $1+2=\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand what the problem is asking for\nWe need to find the value of $\\log_{10}{17}$ between two consecutive integers $a$ and $b$, and then calculate $a + b$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the definition of logarithm\nThe logarithm $\\log_{10}{x}$ gives us the power to which the base (10 in this case) must be raised to obtain the number $x$. In other words, if $\\log_{10}{x} = y$, then $10^y = x$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the range of $\\log_{10}{17}$\nSince $10^1 = 10$ and $10^2 = 100$, $\\log_{10}{17}$ must be between 1 and 2 because 17 is between 10 and 100.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the consecutive integers $a$ and $b$\nFrom the previous step, we can conclude that $a = 1$ and $b = 2$ because $\\log_{10}{17}$ is between 1 and 2.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $a + b$\nNow, we simply add $a$ and $b$ to get the answer. $a + b = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
