    "problem": "Four primes $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ form an increasing arithmetic sequence with $a > 5$ and common difference 6. What is the ones digit of $a$?",
    "solution": "Every prime number greater than 5 has a ones digit of 1, 3, 7, or 9.  For each of these digits, let's add 6, take the resulting ones digit, and repeat the process two more times. We get the following sequences of digits. \\begin{align*}\n1, 7, 3, 9 \\\\\n3, 9, 5, 1 \\\\\n7, 3, 9, 5 \\\\\n9, 5, 1, 7\n\\end{align*} Only the first of these sequences could be the sequence of ones digits of four prime numbers, since each of the other three sequences contains 5.  Therefore, the units digit of $a$ is $\\boxed{1}$. The example $a=11$ shows that there exists such a sequence of consecutive prime numbers.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and recall basic properties of prime numbers and arithmetic sequences.\nWe are looking for four prime numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ that form an increasing arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6, and $a > 5$. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the possible ones digits of prime numbers greater than 5.\nPrime numbers greater than 5 can have ones digits of 1, 3, 7, or 9. This is because any number ending in 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8 is either divisible by 2 or 5, and thus cannot be prime (except for the number 2 itself).\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the sequence of ones digits for each possible starting ones digit of $a$.\nGiven the common difference of 6, we need to consider what happens to the ones digit of each prime as we move through the sequence. Starting with $a$, if its ones digit is 1, then $b$ would end in 7, $c$ would end in 3, and $d$ would end in 9. If $a$ ends in 3, then $b$ would end in 9, $c$ would end in 5 (which is not possible for a prime), so we can stop here for 3. If $a$ ends in 7, then $b$ would end in 3, $c$ would end in 9, and $d$ would end in 5 (again, not possible for a prime). If $a$ ends in 9, then $b$ would end in 5 (not possible for a prime).\n\n## Step 4: Identify the valid sequence based on the analysis.\nFrom the analysis in Step 3, the only valid sequence for the ones digits, given the constraints of prime numbers and the arithmetic sequence, starts with 1. This is because it's the only starting digit that allows all four numbers ($a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$) to potentially be prime (ending in 1, 7, 3, and 9 respectively) without encountering a digit that cannot be the ones digit of a prime number.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
