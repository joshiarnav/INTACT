    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the inverse of a function, we first denote the inverse function as $f^{-1}(x)$.\nThe goal is to solve the equation $y = 4 - 5x$ for $x$, which will give us $x$ as a function of $y$, and then switch $x$ and $y$.\n\n## Step 2: Start with the original function $y = 4 - 5x$.\nWe need to isolate $x$ on one side of the equation.\n\n## Step 3: Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to get $y - 4 = -5x$.\nThis step helps to move the constant term to the other side of the equation.\n\n## Step 4: Divide both sides by -5 to solve for $x$, resulting in $x = \\frac{4-y}{5}$.\nThis gives us $x$ as a function of $y$.\n\n## Step 5: Switch $x$ and $y$ to express the inverse function in terms of $x$, yielding $y = \\frac{4-x}{5}$.\nSince we're looking for $f^{-1}(x)$, we replace $y$ with $f^{-1}(x)$ to get $f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{4-x}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4-x}{5}}$"
