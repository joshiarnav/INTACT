    "solution": "We factor the denominator in the left-hand side to get \\[\\frac{5x+2}{(x-10)(x+3)}= \\frac{A}{x - 10} + \\frac{B}{x + 3}.\\]We then multiply both sides by $(x - 10)(x + 3)$, to get \\[5x + 2 = A(x + 3) + B(x - 10).\\]We can solve for $A$ and $B$ by substituting suitable values of $x$.  For example, setting $x = 10$, the equation becomes $52 = 13A$, so $A = 4$.  Setting $x = -3$, the equation becomes $-13 = -13B$, so $B = 1$.  Therefore, $(A,B) = \\boxed{(4,1)}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Start with the given equation\nThe given equation is $\\frac{5x+2}{x^2-7x-30}=\\frac{A}{x-10}+\\frac{B}{x+3}$. We need to find the values of $A$ and $B$.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the denominator of the left side\nThe denominator $x^2-7x-30$ can be factored as $(x-10)(x+3)$.\n\n## Step 3: Multiply both sides by the common denominator\nMultiplying both sides by $(x-10)(x+3)$ gives $5x+2 = A(x+3) + B(x-10)$.\n\n## Step 4: Choose suitable values for $x$ to solve for $A$ and $B$\nTo solve for $A$ and $B$, we can choose values of $x$ that will make one of the terms on the right side equal to zero. Let's choose $x = 10$ to solve for $A$ and $x = -3$ to solve for $B$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $A$\nSetting $x = 10$ gives $5(10) + 2 = A(10 + 3)$, which simplifies to $52 = 13A$. Solving for $A$ gives $A = \\frac{52}{13} = 4$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $B$\nSetting $x = -3$ gives $5(-3) + 2 = B(-3 - 10)$, which simplifies to $-13 = -13B$. Solving for $B$ gives $B = \\frac{-13}{-13} = 1$.\n\n## Step 7: Write the solution as an ordered pair\nThe values of $A$ and $B$ are $4$ and $1$ respectively, so the solution is $(A, B) = (4, 1)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(4, 1)}$"
