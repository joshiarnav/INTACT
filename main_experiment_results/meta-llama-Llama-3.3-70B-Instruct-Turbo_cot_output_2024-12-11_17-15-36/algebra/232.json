    "problem": "A 1$\\%$ late charge was added to Jenna's bill on the $30^{\\text{th}}$ day past its due date. The resulting total was then increased by 1$\\%$ because she did not pay the bill in the next 30 days either. Her original bill was $\\$400$. Exactly how much is the bill now?",
    "solution": "The first late charge brings the bill to $400 \\cdot 1.01 = 400 + 4 = 404$. The second late charge brings the bill to $404 \\cdot 1.01 = 404 + 4.04 = \\boxed{408.04}$ dollars.\n\n-OR-\n\nEach increase multiples the bill by $1+1\\%=1.01$. Therefore, her final bill is $\\$400(1.01)^2=\\$408.04$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the amount added to Jenna's bill on the 30th day past its due date.\nFirst, we calculate the 1% late charge added to Jenna's original bill of $\\$400$. The late charge is $1\\%$ of $\\$400$, which is $0.01 \\times 400 = \\$4$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the total bill after the first late charge.\nAfter adding the late charge to the original bill, the new total is $\\$400 + \\$4 = \\$404$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the amount added to the bill for not paying in the next 30 days.\nNext, we calculate the 1% increase on the new total of $\\$404$. This increase is $1\\%$ of $\\$404$, which is $0.01 \\times 404 = \\$4.04$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the final bill after the second increase.\nFinally, we add the second increase to the total bill after the first late charge. The final bill is $\\$404 + \\$4.04 = \\$408.04$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{408.04}$"
