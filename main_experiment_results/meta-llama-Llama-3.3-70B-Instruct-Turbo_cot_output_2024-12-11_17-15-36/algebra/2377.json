    "problem": "What is the smallest positive value of $m$ so that the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ has integral solutions?",
    "solution": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the solutions the the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$. We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively, so $p+q = m/10$ and $pq = 420/10 = 42$. Since $m = 10(p+q)$, we minimize $m$ by minimizing the sum $p+q$. Since $p$ and $q$ are integers and multiply to 42, the possible values of $(p,q)$ are $(1,42),(2,21),(3,14),(6,7),(7,6),(14,3),(21,2),(42,1)$. (Note that if $p$ and $q$ are both negative, then $p+q$ is negative, so $m$ would be negative, which is excluded by the problem.) The sum $p+q$ is minimized when $(p,q) = (6,7)$ or $(7,6)$. In either case, $m = 10(p+q) = 10(6+7) = \\boxed{130}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest positive value of $m$ such that the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ has integral solutions, we can use the fact that for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$.\n\nGiven the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$, the sum of the roots ($r_1$ and $r_2$) is $m/10$ and the product of the roots is $420/10 = 42$.\n\nSince we are looking for integral solutions, both $r_1$ and $r_2$ must be integers. The product of the roots is $42$, so we need to find two integers whose product is $42$. The pairs of integers whose product is $42$ are: $(1, 42)$, $(-1, -42)$, $(2, 21)$, $(-2, -21)$, $(3, 14)$, $(-3, -14)$, $(6, 7)$, and $(-6, -7)$.\n\nThe sum of the roots $r_1 + r_2 = m/10$, and since $m$ must be positive, we are looking for pairs of roots where both are positive or one is negative and the other is positive but larger in magnitude (to ensure the sum is positive).\n\nFrom the pairs listed, the ones that could give a positive sum are: $(1, 42)$, $(2, 21)$, $(3, 14)$, and $(6, 7)$. \n\nLet's calculate the sum for each of these pairs and then find the corresponding $m$:\n- For $(1, 42)$, the sum is $43$, so $m/10 = 43$, which gives $m = 430$.\n- For $(2, 21)$, the sum is $23$, so $m/10 = 23$, which gives $m = 230$.\n- For $(3, 14)$, the sum is $17$, so $m/10 = 17$, which gives $m = 170$.\n- For $(6, 7)$, the sum is $13$, so $m/10 = 13$, which gives $m = 130$.\n\nThe smallest positive value of $m$ from these calculations is $130$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{130}$"
