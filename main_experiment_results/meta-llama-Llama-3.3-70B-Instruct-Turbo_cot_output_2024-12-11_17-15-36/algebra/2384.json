    "problem": "What is the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double?",
    "solution": "From the information given, we have $x^2 = 2x + 48$. Rearranging, we get $x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$, which we can factor as $(x+6)(x-8) = 0$. Therefore, $x = -6\\text{ or }8$.  Since we want the lesser, $\\boxed{-6}$ is our answer.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double, let's denote the integer as $x$. We can set up an equation based on the given condition:\n\n\\[x^2 = 2x + 48\\]\n\nRearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0\\]\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation for $x$. We'll use the quadratic formula, where $a = 1$, $b = -2$, and $c = -48$:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\nSubstituting the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the formula:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(-48)}}{2(1)}\\]\n\n\\[x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 192}}{2}\\]\n\n\\[x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{196}}{2}\\]\n\n\\[x = \\frac{2 \\pm 14}{2}\\]\n\nSo, we have two possible values for $x$:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{2 + 14}{2} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8\\]\n\n\\[x = \\frac{2 - 14}{2} = \\frac{-12}{2} = -6\\]\n\nSince we're looking for the least integer, we compare the two solutions. Between $8$ and $-6$, the least integer is $-6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-6}$"
