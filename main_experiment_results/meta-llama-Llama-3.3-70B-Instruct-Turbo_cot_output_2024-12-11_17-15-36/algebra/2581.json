    "problem": "If $a$ is a constant such that $4x^2 + 14x + a$ is the square of a binomial, then what is $a$?",
    "solution": "If $4x^2 + 14x + a$  is the square of a binomial, then the binomial has the form $2x +b$ for some number $b$, because $(2x)^2 = 4x^2$.  So, we compare $(2x+b)^2$ to $4x^2 + 14x + a$. Expanding $(2x+b)^2$ gives \\[(2x+b)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2(2x)(b) + b^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2.\\] Equating the linear term of this to the linear term of $4x^2+14x+a$, we have $4bx=14x$, so $b=\\frac{14}{4}=\\frac{7}{2}$. Squaring the binomial gives $\\left(2x+\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2=4x^2+14x+\\frac{49}{4}$. Therefore, $a=\\boxed{\\frac{49}{4}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand what it means for $4x^2 + 14x + a$ to be the square of a binomial.\nFor $4x^2 + 14x + a$ to be the square of a binomial, it must be of the form $(2x + b)^2$, where $b$ is a constant, because the leading coefficient of $4x^2$ is $4$, which is $2^2$.\n\n## Step 2: Expand the binomial square $(2x + b)^2$ to compare with $4x^2 + 14x + a$.\nExpanding $(2x + b)^2$ gives us $(2x + b)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2(2x)(b) + b^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Compare the coefficients of $x$ in the expanded form with $4x^2 + 14x + a$ to find $b$.\nThe coefficient of $x$ in $4x^2 + 14x + a$ is $14$, and in the expanded form, it's $4b$. Setting these equal gives $4b = 14$, so $b = \\frac{14}{4} = \\frac{7}{2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the value of $b$ to find $a$ by comparing the constant terms.\nSince $b = \\frac{7}{2}$, the constant term in the expanded form is $b^2 = \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{49}{4}$. This must equal $a$ for $4x^2 + 14x + a$ to be a perfect square.\n\n## Step 5: Conclude the value of $a$.\nTherefore, $a = \\frac{49}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{49}{4}}$"
