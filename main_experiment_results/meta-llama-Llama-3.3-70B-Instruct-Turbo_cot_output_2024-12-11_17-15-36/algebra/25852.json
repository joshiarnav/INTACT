    "solution": "First we try factoring the left side to simplify it: $$\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15}=\\frac{4(x-3)}{(x-3)(x+5)}=\\frac{4}{x+5}.$$Now we can multiply both sides by $(x+5)$ and solve for $x$: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{4}{x+5}&=x+2\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n4&=(x+5)(x+2)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=x^2+7x+10\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=x^2+7x+6\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=(x+6)(x+1).\n\\end{align*}So $p=-1$ and $q=-6$, making $p-q=\\boxed{5}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, let's analyze and simplify the given equation to find the values of $p$ and $q$.\nWe start with the equation $\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15}=x+2$. The first step is to factor the denominator to get $\\frac{4x-12}{(x+5)(x-3)}=x+2$.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the numerator to simplify the equation further.\nThe numerator $4x-12$ can be factored as $4(x-3)$. So, the equation becomes $\\frac{4(x-3)}{(x+5)(x-3)}=x+2$.\n\n## Step 3: Cancel out the common factor $(x-3)$ from the numerator and the denominator.\nAfter canceling $(x-3)$, the equation simplifies to $\\frac{4}{x+5}=x+2$. Note that $x \\neq 3$ because it would make the denominator zero before simplification.\n\n## Step 4: Multiply both sides of the equation by $x+5$ to eliminate the fraction.\nMultiplying by $x+5$ gives $4 = (x+2)(x+5)$.\n\n## Step 5: Expand the right side of the equation.\nExpanding the right side yields $4 = x^2 + 7x + 10$.\n\n## Step 6: Rearrange the equation into a standard quadratic form.\nSubtracting $4$ from both sides gives $0 = x^2 + 7x + 6$.\n\n## Step 7: Factor the quadratic equation to find the roots.\nThe quadratic equation $x^2 + 7x + 6$ can be factored into $(x+1)(x+6) = 0$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $x$ to find $p$ and $q$.\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives $x+1=0$ or $x+6=0$, leading to $x=-1$ or $x=-6$.\n\n## Step 9: Determine $p$ and $q$ based on the condition $p > q$.\nSince $p > q$, $p = -1$ and $q = -6$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate $p - q$.\nFinally, calculate $p - q = -1 - (-6)$.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the subtraction.\nSimplifying gives $p - q = -1 + 6 = 5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
