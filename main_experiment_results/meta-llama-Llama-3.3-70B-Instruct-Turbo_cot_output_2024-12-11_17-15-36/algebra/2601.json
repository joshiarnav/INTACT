    "problem": "What is the value of $c$ if $x\\cdot(3x+1)<c$ if and only when $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$?",
    "solution": "When $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$, we have $x\\cdot(3x+1)-c<0$. This means that $x(3x+1)-c=0$ at $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x=2$. We now know that $x(3x+1)-c=0$ is a quadratic equation with roots at $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x=2$, and we want to use these roots to find a quadratic of the same form as the problem.  $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ gives us $(3x+7)=0$ and $x=2$ gives us $(x-2)=0$. \\begin{align*}\nx(3x+1)-c&=(3x+7)(x-2)\\\\\n&=3x^2+x-14\\\\\n&=x(3x+1)-14.\n\\end{align*} So, $c=\\boxed{14}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given inequality and its conditions\nThe given inequality is $x\\cdot(3x+1)<c$, and it holds if and only if $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$. This means the inequality is true for all $x$ in the interval $\\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$ and false for all $x$ outside this interval.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the behavior of the quadratic function\nThe expression $x\\cdot(3x+1)$ is a quadratic function that can be rewritten as $3x^2 + x$. This function is a parabola that opens upwards because the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the critical points of the inequality\nTo find the value of $c$, we need to examine the behavior of the function at the endpoints of the given interval, which are $x = -\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x = 2$. Since the inequality holds true for $x$ within the interval and not outside, the function $3x^2 + x$ should be less than $c$ for $x$ in $\\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$ and equal to or greater than $c$ at the endpoints.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the function at the endpoints\nFirst, let's evaluate $3x^2 + x$ at $x = -\\frac{7}{3}$:\n\\[3\\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right) = 3\\left(\\frac{49}{9}\\right) - \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{49}{3} - \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{42}{3} = 14.\\]\n\nNext, evaluate $3x^2 + x$ at $x = 2$:\n\\[3(2)^2 + 2 = 3(4) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14.\\]\n\n## Step 5: Determine the value of $c$\nSince the function $3x^2 + x$ equals the same value at both endpoints of the interval, and the inequality $x\\cdot(3x+1)<c$ holds true for all $x$ within the interval, the value of $c$ must be equal to the values calculated at the endpoints.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$"
