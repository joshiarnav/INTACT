    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the change of base formula for logarithms\nThe change of base formula for logarithms is $\\log_ab = \\frac{\\log_cb}{\\log_ca}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive real numbers and $c \\neq 1$. This formula allows us to change the base of a logarithm to any other base.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the change of base formula to $\\log_82$\nUsing the change of base formula, we can rewrite $\\log_82$ as $\\frac{\\log 2}{\\log 8}$. Here, we choose base 10 as our new base for simplicity, but any base would work.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression using properties of logarithms\nWe know that $8 = 2^3$, so $\\log 8 = \\log 2^3 = 3\\log 2$. Substituting this back into our expression gives us $\\frac{\\log 2}{3\\log 2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Cancel out common factors in the numerator and denominator\nThe $\\log 2$ in the numerator and the $3\\log 2$ in the denominator have a common factor of $\\log 2$. Canceling this out leaves us with $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$"
