    "solution": "This is a geometric sequence with first term $\\frac{1}{4}$ and common ratio $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus the sum of the first $n$ terms is:\n\n$\\frac{63}{128}=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{1-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n}{1-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)=\\frac{2^n-1}{2^{n+1}}$.\n\nWe see that $\\frac{63}{128}=\\frac{2^6-1}{2^7}$, so $n=\\boxed{6}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the given geometric sequence and its components.\nThe given geometric sequence is $\\left\\{\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{8},\\frac{1}{16},\\dots \\right\\}$. The first term, $a_1$, is $\\frac{1}{4}$, and the common ratio, $r$, is $\\frac{1}{2}$ because each term is half the preceding term.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric sequence.\nThe sum $S_n$ of the first $n$ terms of a geometric sequence can be found using the formula $S_n = \\frac{a_1(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the given values into the formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms.\nGiven that $a_1 = \\frac{1}{4}$, $r = \\frac{1}{2}$, and $S_n = \\frac{63}{128}$, we can substitute these values into the formula: $\\frac{63}{128} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}(1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n)}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation.\nSimplifying the denominator on the right side of the equation gives $\\frac{63}{128} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}(1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n)}{\\frac{1}{2}}$. This simplifies further to $\\frac{63}{128} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n)$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $n$.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction gives $\\frac{63}{64} = 1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^n$. Rearranging the equation to solve for $(\\frac{1}{2})^n$ yields $(\\frac{1}{2})^n = 1 - \\frac{63}{64} = \\frac{1}{64}$.\n\n## Step 6: Express $\\frac{1}{64}$ as a power of $\\frac{1}{2}$ to find $n$.\nSince $\\frac{1}{64} = (\\frac{1}{2})^6$, it follows that $n = 6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
