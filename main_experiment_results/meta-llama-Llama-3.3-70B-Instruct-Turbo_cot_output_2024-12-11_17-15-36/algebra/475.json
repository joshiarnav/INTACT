    "problem": "What is the greatest integer $x$ such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime?",
    "solution": "We can factor the quadratic $6x^2-47x+15$ as $(2x-15)(3x-1)$. So we have $|6x^2-47x+15|=|(2x-15)(3x-1)|=|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|$. In order for $|6x^2-47x+15|$ to be prime, its only divisors must be $1$ and itself. Thus one of $|2x-15|$ or $|3x-1|$ must be equal to $1$.\n\nIf $|3x-1|=1$, then $3x-1=1$ or $3x-1=-1$. These equations yield $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $x=0$, respectively. We throw out $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ since it is not an integer, and keep $x=0$ as a candidate.\n\nIf $|2x-15|=1$, then $2x-15=1$, in which case $2x=16$ and $x=8$, or $2x-15=-1$, in which case $2x=14$ and $x=7$.\n\nThus our candidates for the greatest $x$ are $0, 7$, and $8$. It remains to check whether the other factor is prime. We first check $x=8$. Since $|2x-15|=1$, we know $|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|=|3x-1|=|24-1|=23$, which is prime. Thus $\\boxed{8}$ is the largest integer for which $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the greatest integer $x$ such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime, we first need to factorize the quadratic equation $6x^2-47x+15$.\nThe equation can be factorized as $6x^2-47x+15 = (2x-15)(3x-1)$.\n\n## Step 2: Now, we want $|6x^2-47x+15|$ to be prime, which means $|(2x-15)(3x-1)|$ should be prime.\nFor $|(2x-15)(3x-1)|$ to be prime, its only divisors must be $1$ and itself. This implies that either $|2x-15|$ or $|3x-1|$ must be $1$.\n\n## Step 3: We consider the case when $|3x-1| = 1$.\nSolving $3x-1 = 1$ gives $x = \\frac{2}{3}$, and solving $3x-1 = -1$ gives $x = 0$. Since we are looking for the greatest integer $x$, $x = 0$ is a potential candidate.\n\n## Step 4: Next, we consider the case when $|2x-15| = 1$.\nSolving $2x-15 = 1$ gives $x = 8$, and solving $2x-15 = -1$ gives $x = 7$. Both $x = 8$ and $x = 7$ are potential candidates.\n\n## Step 5: We need to verify if $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is indeed prime for each potential candidate.\nFor $x = 0$, $|6(0)^2-47(0)+15| = |15|$, which is not prime.\nFor $x = 7$, $|6(7)^2-47(7)+15| = |294-329+15| = | -20| = 20$, which is not prime.\nFor $x = 8$, $|6(8)^2-47(8)+15| = |384-376+15| = |23| = 23$, which is prime.\n\n## Step 6: Among the potential candidates, $x = 8$ yields a prime value for $|6x^2-47x+15|$.\nThus, the greatest integer $x$ such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime is $8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
