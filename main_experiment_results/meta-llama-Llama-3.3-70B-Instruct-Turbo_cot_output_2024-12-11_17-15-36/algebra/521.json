    "problem": "Given positive integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x\\neq y$ and $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{18}$, what is the smallest possible value for $x + y$?",
    "solution": "Simplifying, we have  $18(x+y)=xy$, so $xy - 18x - 18y = 0$ Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick by adding 324 to both sides, we get $xy-18x-18y +324=324$, so \\[(x-18)(y-18)=324.\\]Now we seek the minimal $x+y,$ which occurs when $x-18$ and $y-18$ are as close to each other in value as possible. The two best candidates are $(x-18,y-18)=(12,27)$ or $(9,36),$ of which $(x,y)=(30,45)$ attains the minimum sum of $\\boxed{75}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given equation\nWe are given the equation $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{18}$, where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers and $x \\neq y$. This equation can be manipulated to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$.\n\n## Step 2: Manipulate the equation to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$\nTo simplify the equation, we multiply both sides by $18xy$ to clear the denominators. This gives $18y + 18x = xy$, which can be rearranged as $xy - 18x - 18y = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick\nWe add $18^2$ to both sides of the equation $xy - 18x - 18y = 0$ to get $xy - 18x - 18y + 18^2 = 18^2$. This can be factored into $(x - 18)(y - 18) = 18^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the factor pairs of $18^2$\n$18^2 = 324$, and we need to find the factor pairs of $324$. The pairs are $(1, 324), (2, 162), (3, 108), (4, 81), (6, 54), (9, 36), (12, 27), (18, 18)$. Since $x$ and $y$ must be different, we exclude the pair $(18, 18)$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the possible values of $x$ and $y$\nFrom the factor pairs, we calculate the possible values of $x$ and $y$ by adding $18$ to each factor. The pairs become $(19, 342), (20, 180), (21, 126), (22, 99), (24, 72), (27, 54), (30, 45)$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the smallest possible value for $x + y$\nFrom the pairs calculated in Step 5, we find the sum of $x$ and $y$ for each pair and identify the smallest sum. The sums are $361, 200, 147, 121, 96, 81, 75$ respectively.\n\n## Step 7: Identify the smallest sum\nThe smallest possible sum for $x + y$ from the calculated pairs is $75$, which comes from the pair $(30, 45)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{75}$"
