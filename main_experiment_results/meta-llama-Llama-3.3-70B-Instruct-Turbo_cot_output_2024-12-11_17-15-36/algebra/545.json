    "solution": "Looking at the graph, we can see the line intersects the y-axis at y=1.  This is the y-intercept, which is equal to the value of $b$.  Now, we need to find the slope of the line.  Looking carefully, we can see that for every one unit to the right the line travels, it goes up by two units.  For example, starting from the y-intercept at $(0,1)$, the line passes through a lattice point one unit over and two units up from there, at $(1,3)$.  The rise over run is then $\\frac{2}{1}$, so the slope is 2.  The equation of this line is $y=2x+1$.  Therefore, $mb=2(1)=\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the components of the equation of a line\nThe equation of a line can be written as $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the y-intercept (b) from the graph\nFrom the graph, we can see that the line crosses the y-axis at $y = 1$. This means that the y-intercept, $b$, is 1.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the slope (m) of the line\nTo find the slope, we need two points on the line. From the graph, we can see that the line passes through the points $(-3, -5)$ and $(2, 5)$. The slope, $m$, can be calculated using the formula: $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Substituting the given points, we get $m = \\frac{5 - (-5)}{2 - (-3)} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the product of the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b)\nNow that we have found $m = 2$ and $b = 1$, we can find $mb$ by multiplying these two values: $mb = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
