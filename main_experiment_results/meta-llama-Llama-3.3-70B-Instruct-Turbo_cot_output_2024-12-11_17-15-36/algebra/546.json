    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the pattern of the expression\nThe given expression is a series of squared terms where each term alternates between being added and subtracted. The numbers being squared decrease by 2 each time.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the difference of squares\nThe expression can be rewritten using the difference of squares formula: $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$. Applying this to each pair of terms in the expression gives: $(19^2-17^2) + (15^2-13^2) + (11^2-9^2) + (7^2-5^2) + (3^2-1^2)$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the difference of squares formula to each pair\nApplying the formula to each pair:\n- $19^2 - 17^2 = (19 + 17)(19 - 17) = 36 \\times 2 = 72$\n- $15^2 - 13^2 = (15 + 13)(15 - 13) = 28 \\times 2 = 56$\n- $11^2 - 9^2 = (11 + 9)(11 - 9) = 20 \\times 2 = 40$\n- $7^2 - 5^2 = (7 + 5)(7 - 5) = 12 \\times 2 = 24$\n- $3^2 - 1^2 = (3 + 1)(3 - 1) = 4 \\times 2 = 8$\n\n## Step 4: Sum the results of the factored pairs\nAdding up the results: $72 + 56 + 40 + 24 + 8 = 200$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{200}$"
