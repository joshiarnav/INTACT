    "problem": "Two parabolas are the graphs of the equations $y=3x^2+4x-5$ and $y=x^2+11$. Give all points where they intersect. List the points in order of increasing $x$-coordinate, separated by semicolons.",
    "solution": "Setting the right-hand sides of the given equations equal gives $3x^2+4x-5=x^2+11$. Combining like terms gives $2x^2+4x=16$. Dividing by $2$ gives $x^2+2x=8$, and rearranging gives $x^2 +2x - 8=0$.  Factoring gives $(x+4)(x-2)=0$, so our solutions are $x=-4$ and $x=2$.  Substituting these into either of the original equations to find the corresponding values of $y$, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-4, 27);(2, 15)}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the points of intersection between the two parabolas, we first need to set their equations equal to each other.\nWe have $y=3x^2+4x-5$ and $y=x^2+11$. Setting them equal gives $3x^2+4x-5=x^2+11$.\n\n## Step 2: Next, we simplify the equation by moving all terms to one side to get a quadratic equation in standard form.\nSubtracting $x^2+11$ from both sides gives $3x^2-x^2+4x-5-11=0$, which simplifies to $2x^2+4x-16=0$.\n\n## Step 3: Now, we need to solve this quadratic equation for $x$.\nWe can use the quadratic formula, $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=2$, $b=4$, and $c=-16$. Plugging these values into the formula gives $x=\\frac{-4\\pm\\sqrt{4^2-4(2)(-16)}}{2(2)}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression under the square root and solve for $x$.\nThis becomes $x=\\frac{-4\\pm\\sqrt{16+128}}{4}$, which simplifies further to $x=\\frac{-4\\pm\\sqrt{144}}{4}$. Therefore, $x=\\frac{-4\\pm12}{4}$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for the two possible values of $x$.\nThis gives us $x_1=\\frac{-4+12}{4}=2$ and $x_2=\\frac{-4-12}{4}=-4$.\n\n## Step 6: Now that we have the $x$-values, we need to find the corresponding $y$-values by substituting $x$ back into one of the original equations.\nFor $x=2$, using $y=x^2+11$, we get $y=2^2+11=4+11=15$. For $x=-4$, we get $y=(-4)^2+11=16+11=27$.\n\n## Step 7: List the points of intersection in order of increasing $x$-coordinate.\nThe points are $(-4, 27)$ and $(2, 15)$. In the required format, this is $(-4, 27); (2, 15)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(-4, 27); (2, 15)}$"
