    "problem": "The vertex of the parabola described by the equation $y=-3x^2-30x-81$ is $(m,n)$. What is $n$?",
    "solution": "We will complete the square on the given quadratic expression to find the vertex. Factoring $-3$ from the first two terms, we have \\[y=-3(x^2+10x)-81\\]In order to make the expression inside the parentheses a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(10/2)^2=25$ inside the parentheses. Doing this, we get \\[y=-3(x^2+10x+25-25)-81 = -3(x+5)^2-6\\]The graph of an equation of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ is a parabola with vertex at $(h,k)$, so the vertex of our parabola is at $(-5,-6)$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{-6}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the vertex of the parabola described by the equation $y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81$, we'll use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex, which is given by $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are coefficients from the equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$.\n\nGiven the equation $y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81$, we have:\n- $a = -3$\n- $b = -30$\n- $c = -81$\n\nNow, let's calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex:\n$x = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{-30}{2 \\cdot (-3)} = -\\frac{-30}{-6} = -5$\n\nSo, the x-coordinate of the vertex, $m$, is $-5$.\n\nTo find the y-coordinate of the vertex, $n$, we substitute $x = -5$ into the original equation:\n$y = -3(-5)^2 - 30(-5) - 81$\n$y = -3(25) + 150 - 81$\n$y = -75 + 150 - 81$\n$y = -6$\n\nTherefore, $n = -6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-6}$"
