    "problem": "Suppose $x$ and $y$ are integers such that  $xy+5x+4y=-5$.  Find the greatest possible value of $y$.",
    "solution": "Note that $(x+4)(y+5)$ equals $xy+5x+4y+20$.  So, add $20$ to both sides of the original equation to get $xy+5x+4y+20=15$, so now we may apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and write the equation as $(x+4)(y+5)=15$.\n\nThen, the potential ordered pairs $((x+4),(y+5))$ with $x<y$ are $(-15,-1)$, $(-5,-3)$, $(1,15)$ and $(3,5)$, since these are the pairs of integers that multiply to 15.  The greatest value for $y+5$ is thus $15$.  We solve $y+5=15$ for $y$ to yield $y=\\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: We are given the equation $xy+5x+4y=-5$ and need to find the greatest possible value of $y$.\nTo approach this problem, let's first examine the given equation and see if we can manipulate it to isolate or emphasize $y$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick to the equation.\nThe equation can be rewritten by adding a constant to both sides, which will allow us to factor it in a useful way. Adding 20 to both sides gives $xy + 5x + 4y + 20 = 15$. This can be factored into $(x+4)(y+5) = 15$.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the factor pairs of 15.\nSince $x$ and $y$ are integers, the factors $(x+4)$ and $(y+5)$ must also be integers. The pairs of integer factors of 15 are (1,15), (-1,-15), (3,5), and (-3,-5).\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $y$ in each case to find the greatest possible value of $y$.\nFor (1,15), we have $x+4=1$ and $y+5=15$, giving $y=10$.\nFor (-1,-15), we have $x+4=-1$ and $y+5=-15$, giving $y=-20$.\nFor (3,5), we have $x+4=3$ and $y+5=5$, giving $y=0$.\nFor (-3,-5), we have $x+4=-3$ and $y+5=-5$, giving $y=-10$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the greatest possible value of $y$ from the solutions.\nAmong the solutions $y=10$, $y=-20$, $y=0$, and $y=-10$, the greatest possible value of $y$ is $10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
