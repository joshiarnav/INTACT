    "problem": "Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles. If it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles, using the same rates, how many minutes would it take Jordan to run 5 miles?",
    "solution": "Since Steve's 3-mile time is 24 minutes, Jordan ran 2 miles in $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot24=12$ minutes.  Therefore, each mile takes Jordan 6 minutes to run, so he would take $6\\cdot5=\\boxed{30}$ minutes to run five miles.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the time it took Jordan to run 2 miles\nSince Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles, and it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles, we first find the time it took Jordan to run 2 miles. Half of Steve's time is 24 / 2 = 12 minutes.\n\n## Step 2: Determine Jordan's running rate\nTo find Jordan's running rate, we divide the distance he ran by the time it took him. His rate is 2 miles / 12 minutes = 1/6 miles per minute.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the time it would take Jordan to run 5 miles\nUsing Jordan's rate of 1/6 miles per minute, we can find the time it would take him to run 5 miles by dividing the distance by his rate. Time = distance / rate = 5 miles / (1/6 miles per minute) = 5 * 6 = 30 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$"
