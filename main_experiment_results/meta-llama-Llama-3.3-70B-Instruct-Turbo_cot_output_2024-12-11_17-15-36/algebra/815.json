    "problem": "The product of two positive integers plus their sum is 103. The integers are relatively prime, and each is less than 20. What is the sum of the two integers?",
    "solution": "Let our numbers be $a$ and $b$ with $a>b.$ Then $ab+a+b=103$. With Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick in mind, we add $1$ to both sides and get $ab+a+b+1 = 104$, which factors as $(a+1)(b+1)=104$. We consider pairs $(a+1, b+1)$ of factors of $104$: $(104,1), (52,2), (26,4), (13,8)$. Since $a<20$, we can rule out the first 3 pairs, which gives $a=12$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\\boxed{19}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem\nWe need to find two positive integers, let's call them $x$ and $y$, such that $x \\times y + x + y = 103$. The integers are relatively prime (meaning they have no common factors other than 1) and each is less than 20.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick\nThe equation can be rewritten using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick: $xy + x + y + 1 = 104$. This can be factored into $(x + 1)(y + 1) = 104$.\n\n## Step 3: Factor 104\nWe need to find the factors of 104. The factors of 104 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 26, 52, and 104.\n\n## Step 4: List possible pairs of factors\nWe list all possible pairs of factors of 104: (1, 104), (2, 52), (4, 26), (8, 13). Since $x$ and $y$ are less than 20, and the factors are for $x+1$ and $y+1$, we consider pairs where both factors are less than 21.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the constraint that x and y are relatively prime and less than 20\nFrom the pairs listed, considering $x+1$ and $y+1$ must both be less than 21, and knowing $x$ and $y$ are relatively prime, we examine each pair:\n- (1, 104) gives $x=0$, which is not positive.\n- (2, 52) gives $x=1$, $y=51$, but $y$ is not less than 20.\n- (4, 26) gives $x=3$, $y=25$, but $y$ is not less than 20.\n- (8, 13) gives $x=7$, $y=12$. Both $x$ and $y$ are less than 20 and relatively prime.\n\n## Step 6: Check if the pair satisfies the original equation\nFor $x=7$ and $y=12$, $xy + x + y = 7 \\times 12 + 7 + 12 = 84 + 19 = 103$. This satisfies the original equation.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the sum of the two integers\nThe sum of the two integers is $x + y = 7 + 12 = 19$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$"
