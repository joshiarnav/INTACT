    "problem": "The graph of a certain quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertex $(-4,0)$ which passes through the point $(1,-75)$.  What is the value of $a$?",
    "solution": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic must be of the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$.  The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, which gives us the equation $-75 = 25a$.  Hence, $a = -75/25 = \\boxed{-3}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the properties of the given quadratic equation\nThe given quadratic equation is in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, and it represents a parabola with a vertex at $(-4,0)$. This information implies that the equation can also be expressed in vertex form as $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola. Given that the vertex is $(-4,0)$, we can rewrite the equation as $y = a(x + 4)^2$.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the given point into the equation to find $a$\nWe are given that the parabola passes through the point $(1, -75)$. By substituting $x = 1$ and $y = -75$ into the equation $y = a(x + 4)^2$, we can solve for $a$. So, we have $-75 = a(1 + 4)^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $a$\nNow, we solve the equation $-75 = a(5)^2$ for $a$. This simplifies to $-75 = 25a$. To find $a$, we divide both sides of the equation by $25$, giving $a = -75 / 25$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the value of $a$\nPerforming the division, we find $a = -3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-3}$"
