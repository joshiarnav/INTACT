    "solution": "There are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible outcomes of the 10 coin flips. There are $\\binom{10}{8}=\\binom{10}{2}=45$ ways to get exactly 8 heads, so the probability is $\\dfrac{45}{2^{10}}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{45}{1024}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of trials and the probability of success in each trial.\nWe are flipping a fair coin 10 times, and for each flip, the probability of getting heads (success) is 1/2, and the probability of getting tails (failure) is also 1/2.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the number of successful trials we are interested in.\nWe are interested in exactly 8 heads out of the 10 flips.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to get exactly 8 heads in 10 flips.\nThis can be calculated using the binomial coefficient formula, which is $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of trials (10 in this case), $k$ is the number of successful trials (8 in this case), and $!$ denotes factorial. So, the number of ways to get exactly 8 heads in 10 flips is $\\binom{10}{8} = \\frac{10!}{8!(10-8)!} = \\frac{10!}{8!2!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of getting exactly 8 heads and 2 tails in any specific sequence.\nThe probability of getting heads is 1/2, and the probability of getting tails is 1/2. So, the probability of any specific sequence of 8 heads and 2 tails (like HHHHHHHHTT) is $(1/2)^8 \\times (1/2)^2 = (1/2)^{10}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the overall probability of getting exactly 8 heads in 10 flips.\nThis is done by multiplying the number of ways to get exactly 8 heads (from Step 3) by the probability of getting exactly 8 heads and 2 tails in any specific sequence (from Step 4). So, the overall probability is $45 \\times (1/2)^{10} = 45 \\times 1/1024 = 45/1024$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{45}{1024}}$"
