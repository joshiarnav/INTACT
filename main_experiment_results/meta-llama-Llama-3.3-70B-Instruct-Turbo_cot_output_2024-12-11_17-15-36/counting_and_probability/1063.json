    "problem": "How many distinct sequences of four letters can be made from the letters in EQUALS if each sequence must begin with L, end with Q, and no letter can appear in a sequence more than once?",
    "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of letters and their uniqueness in the word EQUALS.\nThe word EQUALS has 6 letters: E, Q, U, A, L, S. Each letter is unique.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the constraints for the sequence.\nThe sequence must start with L, end with Q, and no letter can be repeated.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of options for the second position in the sequence.\nSince the sequence starts with L and ends with Q, and no letter can be repeated, the second position can be filled with any of the remaining letters except L and Q. This leaves us with 4 options: E, U, A, S.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of options for the third position in the sequence.\nAfter selecting a letter for the second position, there will be 3 letters remaining that have not been used (excluding L and Q, and the letter used in the second position).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of distinct sequences based on the options for the second and third positions.\nThe total number of distinct sequences is the product of the number of options for the second and third positions. This is because for each choice in the second position, there are multiple choices for the third position.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the multiplication principle to find the total number of sequences.\nTotal sequences = (Number of options for the second position) * (Number of options for the third position) = 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
