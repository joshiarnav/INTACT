    "problem": "In how many ways can 8 people be seated in a row of chairs if three of the people, John, Wilma, and Paul, refuse to sit in three consecutive seats?",
    "solution": "The number of all seating arrangements is $8!$. The number of seating arrangements in which John, Wilma and Paul sit next to each other is $6!\\times 3!$. We can arrive at $6!\\times 3!$ by considering John, Wilma and Paul as one person, arranging the ``six'' people (the JWP super-person plus the 5 other people) first, then arranging John, Wilma and Paul.  Thus the number of acceptable arrangements is $$8!-6!\\times 3!=8\\times 7\\times 6! - 6!\\times 3! = (8\\times 7 - 3!)6! = (50)(720)=\\boxed{36000}.$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to seat 8 people in a row without any restrictions.\nThe total number of ways to arrange 8 people in a row is 8!. This is because there are 8 choices for the first seat, 7 choices for the second seat, 6 choices for the third seat, and so on, until there is only 1 choice for the last seat.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to seat 8 people with John, Wilma, and Paul sitting in three consecutive seats.\nTo calculate this, we can treat John, Wilma, and Paul as a single unit, which we'll call JWP. This gives us 6 \"people\" (including the JWP unit) to arrange in a row, which can be done in 6! ways. However, within the JWP unit, John, Wilma, and Paul can be arranged in 3! ways. So, the total number of ways for this scenario is 6! * 3!.\n\n## Step 3: Subtract the number of ways with restrictions from the total number of ways to get the final answer.\nThe total number of ways without restrictions is 8!, and the number of ways with John, Wilma, and Paul sitting consecutively is 6! * 3!. So, the number of ways they can be seated with the restriction is 8! - (6! * 3!).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the values of 8! and 6! * 3!.\n8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40320.\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\nSo, 6! * 3! = 720 * 6 = 4320.\n\n## Step 5: Subtract the number of restricted arrangements from the total number of arrangements.\n40320 - 4320 = 36000.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36000}$"
