    "problem": "Bob rolls a fair six-sided die each morning. If Bob rolls a composite number, he eats sweetened cereal. If he rolls a prime number, he eats unsweetened cereal. If he rolls a 1, then he rolls again. In a non-leap year, what is the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal?

    "solution": "Bob is equally likely to end up rolling a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Three of these numbers are prime and two are composite, so there is a $\\frac{3}{5}$ chance he will eat unsweetened cereal and a $\\frac{2}{5}$ chance that he will eat sweetened cereal. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, so the expected value of the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal is $\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot365=219$ and the expected value of the number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal is $\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot365=146$. The difference between 219 days and 146 days is $\\boxed{73}$ days.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the sample space for Bob's die roll\nThe sample space for Bob's die roll consists of the numbers 1 through 6. However, since Bob rolls again if he rolls a 1, the effective sample space is 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n## Step 2: Identify composite and prime numbers in the sample space\nComposite numbers are those that have more than two factors. In the sample space, the composite numbers are 4 and 6. Prime numbers are those that have exactly two factors. In the sample space, the prime numbers are 2, 3, and 5.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of rolling a composite number\nThere are 2 composite numbers (4 and 6) out of the 5 effective outcomes (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). So, the probability of rolling a composite number is 2/5.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of rolling a prime number\nThere are 3 prime numbers (2, 3, and 5) out of the 5 effective outcomes (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). So, the probability of rolling a prime number is 3/5.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal in a non-leap year\nA non-leap year has 365 days. The expected number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal is 365 * (3/5) = 219. The expected number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal is 365 * (2/5) = 146. The expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal is 219 - 146 = 73.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{73}$"
