    "problem": "How many three-digit numbers are multiples of neither 5 nor 7?",
    "solution": "It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 5 or 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \\times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 that is a three-digit number is $142 \\times 7 = 994$.  Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7.  The smallest multiple of 5 that is a three-digit number is $20\\times 5 = 100$, and the largest multiple of 5 that is a three digit number is $199\\times 5 =995$. So there are $199-20+1=180$ multiples of 5.\n\nNow notice that we have counted some numbers twice: those multiples of $5\\times7=35$. The smallest multiple of 35 is $3\\times 35 = 105$, the largest multiple of 35 is $28\\times35 =980$. So there are $28-3+1=26$ multiples of 35.\n\nWe have 128 multiples of 7 and 180 multiples of 5, but we count 26 multiples twice.  So, there are a total of $128+180-26 = 282$ distinct three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 (or both).   There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-282=\\boxed{618}$ three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7 nor 5.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of three-digit numbers.\nTo find the total number of three-digit numbers, we consider numbers from 100 to 999, inclusive. Since the first digit can be anything from 1 to 9 (9 possibilities), the second digit can be anything from 0 to 9 (10 possibilities), and the third digit can also be anything from 0 to 9 (10 possibilities), the total number of three-digit numbers is calculated as follows: $9 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 900$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5.\nThe first multiple of 5 in the three-digit range is 100, and the last is 995. To find how many multiples of 5 there are, we calculate $\\frac{995 - 100}{5} + 1 = 180$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7.\nThe first multiple of 7 in the three-digit range is 105, and the last is 994. To find how many multiples of 7 there are, we calculate $\\frac{994 - 105}{7} + 1 = 128$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of both 5 and 7 (35).\nTo avoid double-counting, we need to find the numbers that are multiples of both 5 and 7, which means multiples of 35. The first such multiple in the three-digit range is 105, and the last is 980. To find how many multiples of 35 there are, we calculate $\\frac{980 - 105}{35} + 1 = 26$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7.\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for two sets A and B, the size of the union of A and B is the size of A plus the size of B, minus the size of their intersection. Therefore, the total number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 is $180 + 128 - 26 = 282$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7.\nTo find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, we subtract the number of multiples of 5 or 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers: $900 - 282 = 618$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{618}$"
