    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric setup and what the question is asking.\nThe question is asking for the probability that a point $P$ randomly selected inside triangle $ABC$ is closer to $C$ than it is to either $A$ or $B$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall that the point closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$ lies inside the region defined by the perpendicular bisectors of segments $AC$ and $BC$.\nThis is a key geometric insight because the perpendicular bisector of a line segment passes through the midpoint of the segment and is perpendicular to it, dividing the plane into two halves where points on one side are closer to one endpoint of the segment, and points on the other side are closer to the other endpoint.\n\n## Step 3: For triangle $ABC$, with $AB = 5$, $BC = 4$, and $CA = 3$, it's a right-angled triangle (since $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$ according to the Pythagorean theorem).\nThis means that the perpendicular bisector of $AC$ and $BC$ will intersect at the midpoint of the hypotenuse $AB$, but what we're really interested in is the area where $P$ is closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$.\n\n## Step 4: The region where $P$ is closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$ can be determined by drawing the perpendicular bisectors of $AC$ and $BC$ and finding their intersection with the sides of the triangle.\nHowever, given that this is a right triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5, we can use geometric properties to simplify our calculations. The perpendicular bisector of $AC$ will divide $AC$ into two equal parts and will be perpendicular to $AC$. Similarly, the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ will divide $BC$ into two equal parts and will be perpendicular to $BC$.\n\n## Step 5: To find the area where $P$ is closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$, we consider the triangle formed by the perpendicular bisectors and the sides of triangle $ABC$.\nIn the case of a right-angled triangle, the region closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$ is actually the area of the triangle formed by the midpoint of $AB$ (which is also the circumcenter of the triangle since it's a right triangle), and the segments connecting this midpoint to $A$ and $B$ are not directly relevant. Instead, we focus on the area defined by the perpendicular bisectors of $AC$ and $BC$.\n\n## Step 6: Since the triangle is a 3-4-5 right triangle, the area of the entire triangle $ABC$ can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\nThe area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 4 = 6$ square units.\n\n## Step 7: The region closer to $C$ is actually a rectangle formed by connecting the midpoints of $AC$ and $BC$ with the perpendicular lines from $A$ and $B$ to $CC'$, where $C'$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $C$ to $AB$.\nThis rectangle's sides are half the lengths of $AC$ and $BC$ because it is bounded by the perpendicular bisectors of $AC$ and $BC$. Thus, its dimensions are $\\frac{3}{2}$ by $\\frac{4}{2}$, giving an area of $\\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{2} = 3$ square units.\n\n## Step 8: To find the probability that $P$ is closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$, we divide the area of the region closer to $C$ by the total area of triangle $ABC$.\nThe probability is thus $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$"
