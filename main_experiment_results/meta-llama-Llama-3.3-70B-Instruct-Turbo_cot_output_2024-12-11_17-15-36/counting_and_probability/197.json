    "problem": "A pirate is searching for buried treasure on 6 islands. On each island, there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that the island has buried treasure and no traps, a $\\frac{1}{12}$ chance that the island has traps but no treasure, and a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance that the island has neither traps nor treasure. What is the probability that while searching all 6 islands, the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure, and none with traps?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose 3 islands. For each of these choices, there is a probability of $\\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3$ that the chosen islands have treasure and the remaining ones have neither treasure nor traps. Therefore, the probability that the pirate encounters exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps is $20 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the probability of an island having treasure and no traps\nThe probability of an island having treasure and no traps is given as $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the probability of an island having neither traps nor treasure\nThe probability of an island having neither traps nor treasure is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 islands out of 6 for the treasure\nThe number of ways to choose 3 islands out of 6 for the treasure can be calculated using the combination formula: $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Substituting $n = 6$ and $k = 3$, we get $C(6, 3) = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of 3 islands having treasure and no traps, and 3 islands having neither traps nor treasure\nThe probability of 3 islands having treasure and no traps is $(\\frac{1}{4})^3$, and the probability of 3 islands having neither traps nor treasure is $(\\frac{2}{3})^3$. Since these are independent events, we multiply these probabilities: $(\\frac{1}{4})^3 \\times (\\frac{2}{3})^3$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total probability of exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps\nThe total probability is the product of the probability of choosing 3 islands for the treasure, the probability of those 3 islands having treasure, and the probability of the remaining 3 islands having neither traps nor treasure: $C(6, 3) \\times (\\frac{1}{4})^3 \\times (\\frac{2}{3})^3 = 20 \\times \\frac{1}{64} \\times \\frac{8}{27}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression to find the total probability\n$20 \\times \\frac{1}{64} \\times \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{20 \\times 8}{64 \\times 27} = \\frac{160}{1728} = \\frac{5}{54}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$"
