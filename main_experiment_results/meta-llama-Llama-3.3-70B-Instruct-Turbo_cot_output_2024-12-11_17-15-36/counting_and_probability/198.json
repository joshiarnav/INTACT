    "problem": "An unfair coin lands on heads with probability $\\frac34$ and tails with probability $\\frac14$.  A heads flip gains $\\$3$, but a tails flip loses $\\$8$.  What is the expected worth of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "By definition, we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities, and add them up: $E = \\frac34(+\\$3) + \\frac14(-\\$8) = \\boxed{\\$0.25}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the probability of each outcome\nThe probability of landing on heads is $\\frac{3}{4}$ and the probability of landing on tails is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the worth of each outcome\nA heads flip gains $\\$3$ and a tails flip loses $\\$8$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the expected worth of a coin flip\nThe expected worth of a coin flip is calculated by multiplying the probability of each outcome by its worth and then summing these products. So, the expected worth $E$ is given by:\n\\[ E = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)(3) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)(-8) \\]\n\n## Step 4: Perform the calculation\n\\[ E = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)(3) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)(-8) \\]\n\\[ E = \\frac{9}{4} - \\frac{8}{4} \\]\n\\[ E = \\frac{9 - 8}{4} \\]\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\\[ E = 0.25 \\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.25}$"
