    "problem": "The probability that Kim has a math test today is $\\frac{4}{7}$. What is the probability that Kim does not have a math test today? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that Kim does not have a math test is equal to one minus the probability she does have a math test. So, the probability of not having a math test is $1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the problem\nThe problem states that the probability of Kim having a math test today is $\\frac{4}{7}$. We need to find the probability that Kim does not have a math test today.\n\n## Step 2: Finding the probability of not having a math test\nTo find the probability that Kim does not have a math test, we subtract the probability of having a math test from 1, since the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes must be 1. So, the probability of not having a math test is $1 - \\frac{4}{7}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculating the probability\nNow, we calculate the probability of not having a math test. $1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{7}{7} - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{3}{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$"
