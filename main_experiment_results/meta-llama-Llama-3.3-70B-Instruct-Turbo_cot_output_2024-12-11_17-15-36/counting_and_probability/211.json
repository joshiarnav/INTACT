    "problem": "Suppose 5 different integers are randomly chosen from between 20 and 69, inclusive.  What is the probability that they each have a different tens digit?",
    "solution": "In this set of integers, there are 5 tens digits: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.  If 5 integers all have different tens digits, then there must be exactly one integer among the 5 with each tens digit.  Since there are 10 different integers for each tens digit, the number of ways to pick, without regard to order, 5 different integers with different tens digits is $10^5$.  The total number of combinations of 5 integers is $\\binom{50}{5}$.  So the probability that 5 integers drawn all have the different tens digits is $$ \\frac{10^5}{\\binom{50}{5}} = \\frac{100000}{2118760} = \\boxed{\\frac{2500}{52969}}. $$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the range of tens digits in the given numbers\nThe tens digits in the numbers from 20 to 69 are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. This gives us a total of 5 different tens digits.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 different integers with different tens digits\nTo ensure that each of the 5 integers has a different tens digit, we can choose one number from each of the tens digit groups (20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69). There are 10 numbers in each group, so there are $10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 10^5 = 100,000$ ways to choose 5 numbers with different tens digits.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 integers from the given range\nThe total number of integers between 20 and 69, inclusive, is $69 - 20 + 1 = 50$. We need to choose 5 different integers from these 50 numbers, which can be done in $\\binom{50}{5} = \\frac{50!}{5!(50-5)!} = \\frac{50!}{5!45!} = 2,118,760$ ways.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of choosing 5 integers with different tens digits\nThe probability of choosing 5 integers with different tens digits is the number of ways to choose such integers divided by the total number of ways to choose 5 integers. This probability is $\\frac{100,000}{2,118,760}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the probability\nWe can simplify the fraction $\\frac{100,000}{2,118,760}$ by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 20. $\\frac{100,000}{2,118,760} = \\frac{5,000}{105,938}$. However, to follow the format and provide a final numerical answer, we should calculate the decimal representation and then round it, but since the format asks for a boxed answer, we will leave it as a fraction and then box the final result of the division as the solution requires a specific format that implies a numerical value. The final step is to perform the division to get the actual probability in decimal form, but since we need to follow the format to the letter, let's proceed to present the solution as requested.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2500}{52969}}$"
