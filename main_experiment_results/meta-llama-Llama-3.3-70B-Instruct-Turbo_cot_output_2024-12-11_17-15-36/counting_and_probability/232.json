    "solution": "We note that the points for which $x+y<3$ are those that lie below the line $x+y = 3$, or $y= -x + 3$.  As the diagram below illustrates, these are all the points in the square except those in the triangle with vertices (2,1), (2,2), and (1,2).\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(.7);\n\ndraw((-.1,0)--(3,0),Arrow);\ndraw((0,-.1)--(0,4),Arrow);\n\ndraw((0,2)--(2,2)--(2,0));\ndraw((-.5,3.5)--(2.5,.5),dashed,Arrows);\n\nfill((0,0)--(0,2)--(1,2)--(2,1)--(2,0)--cycle,gray(.7));\n\nlabel(\"(1,2)\",(1,2),NE);\nlabel(\"(2,2)\",(2,2),NE);\nlabel(\"(2,1)\",(2,1),NE);\n[/asy]\n\nSince this is a right triangle whose sides both of length 1, its area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1^2 = 1/2$.  Since the square in question has side length 2, its area is $2^2 = 4$, so the shaded region has area $4 - 1/2 = 7/2$.  Our probability is therefore $\\dfrac{7/2}{4} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{8}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem and understand the condition\nThe problem asks for the probability that a randomly chosen point $(x,y)$ inside a square with vertices (0,0), (0,2), (2,2), and (2,0) satisfies the condition $x+y < 3$. This condition describes an area within the square.\n\n## Step 2: Visualize the square and the condition $x+y < 3$\nTo visualize the condition $x+y < 3$, we can plot the line $x+y = 3$ and determine the area of the square that satisfies $x+y < 3$. The line $x+y = 3$ can be rewritten as $y = -x + 3$. This line has a y-intercept at (0,3) and an x-intercept at (3,0).\n\n## Step 3: Determine the area where $x+y < 3$\nSince the square's vertices are (0,0), (0,2), (2,2), and (2,0), and the line $y = -x + 3$ intersects the square, we need to find where it intersects the boundaries of the square. The line intersects the x-axis at (3,0), which is outside the square, and it intersects the y-axis at (0,3), which is also outside the square but indicates that all points below this line and within the square satisfy $x+y < 3$. The line does intersect the top edge of the square, where $y = 2$, so $2 = -x + 3$, giving $x = 1$. Thus, the point of intersection on the top edge of the square is (1,2).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the region where $x+y < 3$\nThe area of the entire square is $2 \\times 2 = 4$ square units. The area where $x+y \\geq 3$ is a triangle with vertices (1,2), (2,2), and (2,1), which has a base and height of 1 unit. The area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ square units. Therefore, the area where $x+y < 3$ is $4 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}$ square units.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability\nThe probability that a randomly chosen point satisfies $x+y < 3$ is the ratio of the area where $x+y < 3$ to the total area of the square. Thus, the probability is $\\frac{\\frac{7}{2}}{4} = \\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$"
