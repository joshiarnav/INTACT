    "problem": "Four horizontal lines and four vertical lines are drawn in a plane. In how many ways can four lines be chosen such that a rectangular region is enclosed?",
    "solution": "In order for the four lines to enclose a rectangular region, we must choose two horizontal and two vertical lines.  If we were to choose more than two of one of these types of lines, we would not be able to enclose any region.  We can count independently the number of ways to choose vertical and horizontal lines.  There will be $\\dbinom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose horizontal lines, and the same number of ways to choose two vertical lines.  Since these are independent, there are a total of $6\\cdot 6=\\boxed{36}$ ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the requirements for a rectangle\nTo enclose a rectangular region, we need two horizontal lines and two vertical lines.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose two horizontal lines\nThere are 4 horizontal lines, and we need to choose 2 of them. This can be done in $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose two vertical lines\nThere are 4 vertical lines, and we need to choose 2 of them. This can also be done in $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle\nSince choosing the horizontal lines and choosing the vertical lines are independent events, we multiply the number of ways for each event. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$"
