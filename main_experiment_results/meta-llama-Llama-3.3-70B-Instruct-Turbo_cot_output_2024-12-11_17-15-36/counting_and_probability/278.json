    "problem": "After a gymnastics meet, each gymnast shook hands once with every gymnast on every team (except herself). Afterwards, a coach came down and only shook hands with each gymnast from her own team. There were a total of 281 handshakes. What is the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in?",
    "solution": "The number of gymnasts is some integer $n$, so that the number of gymnast-gymnast handshakes is ${n \\choose 2}$ for some $n$. Also, the coach must participate in an integer $k<n$ number of handshakes. So, ${n \\choose 2} + k = 281$. If we want to minimize $k$, we need the maximal $n$ such that ${n \\choose 2} \\le 281$, which implies $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 281$ or $n^2 - n - 562 \\le 0 $. So, the maximal $n$ is 24. So, $k = 281 - {24 \\choose 2} = 281 - 12 \\cdot 23 = 281 - 276 = \\boxed{5}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of handshakes without the coach.\nLet's denote the total number of gymnasts as $n$. Each gymnast shook hands with every other gymnast once, except for herself. This can be represented by the combination formula $C(n, 2) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, which gives the total number of handshakes between gymnasts.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the coach's handshakes.\nThe coach only shook hands with each gymnast from her own team. Let's denote the number of gymnasts on the coach's team as $m$. Therefore, the coach participated in $m$ handshakes.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate the equation with the given total number of handshakes.\nWe are given that the total number of handshakes, including those with the coach, is 281. This can be represented as $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + m = 281$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in.\nTo minimize $m$, we need to maximize $n$ such that $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ is as close as possible to 281, but still less than or equal to 281, since $m$ cannot be negative.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $n$ to find the maximum number of gymnast handshakes.\nLet's solve the inequality $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\leq 281$ for $n$ to find the largest $n$ that satisfies this condition. This means $n^2 - n - 562 \\leq 0$. We need to find the roots of $n^2 - n - 562 = 0$ and determine the integer values of $n$ that satisfy the inequality.\n\n## Step 6: Find the roots of the quadratic equation.\nThe roots of $n^2 - n - 562 = 0$ can be found using the quadratic formula: $n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Here, $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = -562$. Thus, $n = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-562)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 2248}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{2249}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm 47.43}{2}$. This gives $n \\approx \\frac{1 + 47.43}{2} = 24.215$ and $n \\approx \\frac{1 - 47.43}{2} = -23.215$. Since $n$ must be a positive integer, we consider $n$ up to 24.\n\n## Step 7: Test $n = 24$ to see if it satisfies the condition.\nFor $n = 24$, $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \\frac{24(24-1)}{2} = \\frac{24 \\times 23}{2} = 276$. This is less than 281, which means the coach's handshakes can be minimized with this $n$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in.\nGiven $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 276$ for $n = 24$, the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in is $281 - 276 = 5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
