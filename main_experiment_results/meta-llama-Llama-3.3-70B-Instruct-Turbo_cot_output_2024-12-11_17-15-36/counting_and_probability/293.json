    "problem": "William is taking the 25-question, multiple choice American Mathematics Competition. Each question has five answer choices. William guesses random answers for the last four questions. What is the probability that he will get at least one of these final four questions right?",
    "solution": "We find the probability that William misses the last four questions, and subtract from 1. The probability of William missing a question is $\\frac{4}{5}$, so the probability that he misses all four is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = \\frac{256}{625}$. The probability that he gets at least one right is $1-\\frac{256}{625} =\\boxed{\\frac{369}{625}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the probability of getting a single question wrong\nSince each question has five answer choices and William is guessing randomly, the probability of getting a single question wrong is $\\frac{4}{5}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of getting all 4 questions wrong\nTo find the probability of getting at least one question right, we first need to calculate the probability of getting all 4 questions wrong. This is done by multiplying the probability of getting a single question wrong by itself 4 times, since the guesses are independent. So, the probability of getting all 4 questions wrong is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of getting at least one question right\nThe probability of getting at least one question right is the complement of getting all 4 questions wrong. This can be calculated as $1 - \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4$.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the calculation\nNow, we calculate $1 - \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = 1 - \\frac{256}{625} = \\frac{625 - 256}{625} = \\frac{369}{625}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{369}{625}}$"
