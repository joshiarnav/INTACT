    "problem": "How many positive multiples of $7$ that are less than $1000$ end with the digit $3$?",
    "solution": "Listing the first 10 multiples of 7, which are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, we see that the only positive multiples of 7 that end in 3 are those that are the product of 7 and a number that ends in 9.  Therefore, the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3 are $7\\cdot 9 = 63$, $7\\cdot 19= 133$, $7\\cdot 29 = 203$, . . .  Notice that we can get from each to the next by adding $7\\cdot 10 = 70$, so our multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 are 63, 133, 203, . . ., 903, 973.  The last one is 910 more than the first. Since $910/70=13$, we see that we have taken 13 steps of 70 to get from the first number in the list to the last. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{14}$ numbers in the list.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the positive multiples of 7 that end with the digit 3, we need to consider the pattern of multiples of 7.\nMultiples of 7 follow a pattern where the last digit repeats every 10 numbers (7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, then the pattern repeats).\n\n## Step 2: Identify the first multiple of 7 that ends with the digit 3.\nThe first multiple of 7 that ends with 3 is 63, as 7 * 9 = 63.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the pattern for multiples of 7 that end in 3.\nSince 63 is the first occurrence, and the pattern of the last digit of multiples of 7 repeats every 10 multiples, we add 10 to the multiplier (9 in this case) to find the next occurrence. However, because we're looking for numbers that specifically end in 3, we need to find the sequence that leads to this condition being true.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sequence of multipliers that result in multiples of 7 ending in 3.\nStarting from 9 (since 7*9 = 63), we add 10 (the length of the cycle for the last digit) to find the next number that ends in 3. So, the sequence of multipliers will be 9, 19, 29, and so on, until we reach a number that, when multiplied by 7, is greater than or equal to 1000.\n\n## Step 5: Find the largest multiple of 7 less than 1000 that ends in 3.\nTo find the largest multiple of 7 less than 1000 that ends in 3, we need to find the largest value of n in the sequence (9 + 10n) such that 7 * (9 + 10n) < 1000.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the value of n.\nLet's calculate: 7 * (9 + 10n) < 1000.\nSimplifying gives: 63 + 70n < 1000.\nSubtract 63 from both sides: 70n < 937.\nDivide by 70: n < 13.38.\nSince n must be an integer, the largest value of n that satisfies the condition is 13.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total number of multiples.\nGiven that n starts at 0 (for the first occurrence, 9) and goes up to 13, the total number of occurrences (including the first one) is 13 + 1 = 14.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$"
