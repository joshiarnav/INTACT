    "problem": "If two distinct numbers are selected at random from the first seven prime numbers, what is the probability that their sum is an even number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2. There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum IS even is $1-\\frac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the first seven prime numbers.\nThe first seven prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the conditions for the sum to be even.\nThe sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are odd or both numbers are even.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of even prime numbers among the first seven primes.\nThere is only one even prime number, which is 2.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the number of odd prime numbers among the first seven primes.\nThere are six odd prime numbers: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to select two distinct numbers from the seven primes.\nThe total number of ways to choose 2 numbers out of 7 is given by the combination formula $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, $C(7, 2) = \\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to select two distinct odd numbers (since there's only one even prime, selecting two evens is impossible).\nThe number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers out of 6 is $C(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability that the sum of two distinct selected numbers is even.\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes (sum is even) divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Since the only way to have an even sum is to pick two odd numbers (given there's only one even prime and you can't pick two evens), the probability is $\\frac{15}{21}$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the fraction to express the probability in the simplest form.\nThe fraction $\\frac{15}{21}$ can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. Thus, $\\frac{15}{21} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$"
