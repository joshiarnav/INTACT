    "problem": "A Senate committee has 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats.  In how many ways can we form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats?",
    "solution": "There are 8 Republicans and 3 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ ways to choose the Republicans.  There are 6 Democrats and 2 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose the Democrats.  So there are $56 \\times 15 = \\boxed{840}$ ways to choose the subcommittee.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the number of ways to choose Republicans for the subcommittee.\nTo form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans out of 8, we use the combination formula, which is given by $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. For the Republicans, this would be $C(8, 3) = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose Republicans.\nWe calculate $C(8, 3) = \\frac{8!}{3!(5!)} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{336}{6} = 56$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the number of ways to choose Democrats for the subcommittee.\nSimilarly, to choose 2 Democrats out of 6, we use the combination formula: $C(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose Democrats.\nWe calculate $C(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(4!)} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the total number of ways to form the subcommittee.\nThe total number of ways to form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats is the product of the number of ways to choose the Republicans and the number of ways to choose the Democrats, since for each choice of Republicans, there are that many possible choices of Democrats. So, the total number of ways is $56 \\times 15$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of ways.\nWe calculate the total number of ways: $56 \\times 15 = 840$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{840}$"
