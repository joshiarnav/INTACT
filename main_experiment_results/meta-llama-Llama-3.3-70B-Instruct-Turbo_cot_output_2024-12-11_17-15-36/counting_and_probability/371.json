    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable but the boxes are?",
    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of balls in the different boxes.\n\nThere are $3$ ways to arrange the balls as $(5,0,0)$ (specifically, box 1 can have 5, box 2 can have 5, box 3 can have 5).\n\nThere are $3! = 6$ to arrange $(4,1,0)$ and $3! = 6$ ways to arrange $(3,2,0)$; in each case, we must choose one of the 3 boxes to have the largest number of balls, and also one of the remaining two boxes to be left empty.\n\nHowever, there are only $3$ ways to arrange $(3,1,1)$, and $3$ ways to arrange $(2,2,1)$; in each case, we must choose one box to have the `different' number of balls (3 in the $(3,1,1)$ case and 1 in the $(2,2,1)$ case).\n\nThis gives a total of $3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = \\boxed{21}$ arrangements.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem involves distributing 5 indistinguishable balls into 3 distinguishable boxes. Since the balls are indistinguishable, we only need to consider the number of balls in each box.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the possible distributions\nTo find the number of ways to distribute the balls, we can use a stars and bars approach. Imagine the 5 balls as stars and the divisions between the boxes as bars. We have 5 stars (representing the balls) and 2 bars (to divide the balls into 3 groups representing the boxes).\n\n## Step 3: Apply the stars and bars method\nThe number of ways to arrange these stars and bars is equivalent to choosing 2 positions out of 7 (5 stars + 2 bars) for the bars. This can be calculated using combinations, specifically \"7 choose 2\", denoted as C(7,2) or sometimes expressed in terms of factorials as 7! / (2! * (7-2)!).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the combinations\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, the product of all positive integers up to that number. For our case, n = 7 (total positions for stars and bars) and k = 2 (number of bars).\n\n## Step 5: Perform the calculation\nC(7,2) = 7! / [2!(7-2)!] = 7! / (2! * 5!) = (7*6) / (2*1) = 21.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$"
