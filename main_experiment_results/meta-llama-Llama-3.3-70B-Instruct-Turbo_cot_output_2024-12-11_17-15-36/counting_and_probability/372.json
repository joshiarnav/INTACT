    "solution": "The number of pairs of neighbors for Cara actually has nothing to do with the shape of the table she is sitting at. That is, all that matters is that she has 5 friends and two of them will be her neighbors. There are ${5 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{10}$ pairs of friends that she can thus sit between.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the total number of friends Cara has.\nCara has 5 friends in total.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of ways to choose 2 friends from the total.\nTo find the number of different possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between, we need to calculate the number of combinations of 2 friends out of the 5. This can be calculated using the combination formula: $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the combination formula with n=5 and k=2.\nSubstituting the values into the combination formula, we get $C(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!}$. Simplifying this gives $C(5, 2) = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final value.\nPerforming the multiplication and division, we find $C(5, 2) = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
