    "problem": "The numbers from 1 to 150, inclusive, are placed in a bag and a number is randomly selected from the bag. What is the probability it is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "It is easier to count the number of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. We see there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150, namely $1^{2}, 2^{2}, \\ldots, 12^{2}$, and there are 5 perfect cubes, namely $1^{3}, \\ldots, 5^{3}$. Then notice there are two repetitions, $1^{6} =1^2 = 1^3 = 1$ and $2^{6} = 8^2 = 4^3 = 64$. So there is a total of $12+5-2=15$ integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Thus, we get $150-15=135$ integers from 1 to 150 that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes. So the probability that we select such a number is $\\frac{135}{150} = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the total number of outcomes\nThe total number of outcomes is the total count of numbers from 1 to 150, inclusive, which is 150.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the numbers that are perfect squares\nTo find the numbers that are perfect squares, we need to identify the squares of integers from 1 up to the square root of 150. Since $\\sqrt{150}$ is approximately 12.25, we consider the squares of integers from 1 to 12. These are $1^2=1$, $2^2=4$, $3^2=9$, $4^2=16$, $5^2=25$, $6^2=36$, $7^2=49$, $8^2=64$, $9^2=81$, $10^2=100$, $11^2=121$, and $12^2=144$. So, there are 12 perfect squares.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the numbers that are perfect cubes\nTo find the numbers that are perfect cubes, we consider the cubes of integers from 1 up to the cube root of 150. Since $\\sqrt[3]{150}$ is approximately 5.31, we consider the cubes of integers from 1 to 5. These are $1^3=1$, $2^3=8$, $3^3=27$, $4^3=64$, and $5^3=125$. So, there are 5 perfect cubes.\n\n## Step 4: Identify any overlap between perfect squares and perfect cubes\nWe notice that there are two numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes: $1$ (since $1^2=1$ and $1^3=1$) and $64$ (since $8^2=64$ and $4^3=64$). This means we have counted these two numbers twice.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of perfect squares and perfect cubes, accounting for overlap\nThe total number of perfect squares or perfect cubes is the sum of the counts of perfect squares and perfect cubes minus the overlap count. This is $12 + 5 - 2 = 15$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of selecting a number that is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube\nThe probability of selecting a number that is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube is calculated as 1 minus the probability of selecting a number that is a perfect square or a perfect cube. The probability of selecting a perfect square or a perfect cube is $\\frac{15}{150}$. Therefore, the probability of selecting a number that is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube is $1 - \\frac{15}{150} = \\frac{135}{150} = \\frac{9}{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$"
