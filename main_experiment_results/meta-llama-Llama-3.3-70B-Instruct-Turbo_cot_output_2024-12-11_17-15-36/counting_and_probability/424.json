    "problem": "How many three digit numbers are left if we exclude all three digit numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent?",
    "solution": "The only three digit numbers which are ruled out are numbers of the form $ABA$, where A and B are different digits. There are 9 ways to choose A, since it can't be 0, and once A has been chosen there are 9 ways to choose B. Since there are $9\\cdot10\\cdot10=900$ total three digit numbers, and $9\\cdot9=81$ numbers which aren't valid, there are $900-81=\\boxed{819}$ valid numbers.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of three-digit numbers.\nTo find the total number of three-digit numbers, we consider that the first digit can be any number from 1 to 9 (since 0 cannot be the first digit), and the second and third digits can each be any number from 0 to 9. Thus, the total number of three-digit numbers is calculated as 9 * 10 * 10 = 900.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the pattern to exclude.\nWe need to exclude all three-digit numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent. This means the pattern to exclude is ABA, where A and B are different digits, and A cannot be 0.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of three-digit numbers to exclude.\nFor the pattern ABA, A can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 choices), and B can be any digit from 0 to 9 except the digit chosen for A (10 - 1 = 9 choices for each A). Thus, the total number of three-digit numbers to exclude is 9 * 9 = 81.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of three-digit numbers left after exclusion.\nTo find the number of three-digit numbers left, we subtract the number of excluded numbers from the total number of three-digit numbers. So, 900 - 81 = 819.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{819}$"
