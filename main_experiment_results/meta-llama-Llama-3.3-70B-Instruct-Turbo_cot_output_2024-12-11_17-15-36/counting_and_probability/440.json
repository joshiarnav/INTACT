    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total area of the region from which the point is being selected.\nThe total area can be calculated as the length times the width of the region. Given $0 \\le x \\le 3$ and $0 \\le y \\le 6$, the total area is $3 \\times 6 = 18$ square units.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the region where $x+y \\le 4$.\nThis inequality describes a region in the coordinate plane. By rearranging the inequality, we get $y \\le -x + 4$. This means all points on or below the line $y = -x + 4$ satisfy the condition. The line intersects the y-axis at $y = 4$ (when $x = 0$) and intersects the x-axis at $x = 4$ (when $y = 0$), but since our region of interest is bounded by $0 \\le x \\le 3$ and $0 \\le y \\le 6$, we only consider the part of this line within these bounds.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area of the region where $x+y \\le 4$ within the given bounds.\nTo find this area, we first need to determine the points where the line $y = -x + 4$ intersects the boundary of our region. When $x = 3$, $y = -3 + 4 = 1$. Thus, the line intersects the right boundary of our region ($x = 3$) at $y = 1$. The region where $x+y \\le 4$ forms a trapezoid with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(0,4)$, $(3,1)$, and $(3,0)$. The area of a trapezoid is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (b_1 + b_2) \\times h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the parallel sides, and $h$ is the height (the distance between the parallel sides). Here, $b_1 = 4$ (the length from $(0,0)$ to $(0,4)$), $b_2 = 1$ (the length from $(3,0)$ to $(3,1)$), and $h = 3$ (the distance from $x = 0$ to $x = 3$).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the trapezoid.\nUsing the formula for the area of a trapezoid: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (4 + 1) \\times 3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 3 = \\frac{15}{2}$ square units.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that $x+y \\le 4$.\nThe probability is the ratio of the area where $x+y \\le 4$ to the total area. Thus, the probability is $\\frac{15/2}{18} = \\frac{15}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{18} = \\frac{15}{36} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{12}}$"
