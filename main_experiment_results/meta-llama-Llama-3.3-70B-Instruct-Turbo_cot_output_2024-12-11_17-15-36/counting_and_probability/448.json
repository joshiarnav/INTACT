    "solution": "Since $N!=(N-1)!(N)$, we can rewrite the given fraction as $\\frac{N!}{(N+1)!}$. We can rewrite the denominator as $(N+1)!=(N!)(N+1)$, so the fraction becomes $\\frac{N!}{(N!)(N+1)}$. Canceling an $N!$ from the numerator and denominator, we are left with $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{N+1}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given expression\nThe given expression is \\[\\frac{(N-1)!(N)}{(N+1)!}.\\] This involves factorials, which are denoted by the exclamation mark (!) and represent the product of all positive integers up to that number. For example, $N! = N \\times (N-1) \\times (N-2) \\times \\cdots \\times 2 \\times 1$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the expression\nFirst, notice that $(N-1)!(N)$ can be simplified to $N!$ because $(N-1)! \\times N = N!$. So, the expression becomes \\[\\frac{N!}{(N+1)!}.\\]\n\n## Step 3: Further simplify using factorial properties\nRecognize that $(N+1)! = (N+1) \\times N!$. This means we can rewrite the expression as \\[\\frac{N!}{(N+1) \\times N!}.\\]\n\n## Step 4: Cancel out common terms\nSince $N!$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out, leaving us with \\[\\frac{1}{N+1}.\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{N+1}}$"
