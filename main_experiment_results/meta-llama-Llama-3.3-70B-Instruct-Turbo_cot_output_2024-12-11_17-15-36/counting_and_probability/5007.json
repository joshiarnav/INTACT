    "problem": "What is the largest $2$-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$?\n",
    "solution": "Expanding the binomial coefficient, we get ${200 \\choose 100}=\\frac{200!}{100!100!}$. Let the required prime be $p$; then $10 \\le p < 100$. If $p > 50$, then the factor of $p$ appears twice in the denominator. Thus, we need $p$ to appear as a factor at least three times in the numerator, so $3p<200$. The largest such prime is $\\boxed{61}$, which is our answer.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify what is being asked\nWe are asked to find the largest 2-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$. This means we need to calculate the value of $n$ and then find its prime factors, focusing on the largest 2-digit prime factor.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the value of $n = {200\\choose 100}$\nThe formula for combinations is given by ${n\\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Applying this formula, we get $n = \\frac{200!}{100!100!}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression for $n$\nWe can simplify the expression by canceling out the common factors in the numerator and denominator. This gives us $n = \\frac{200 \\times 199 \\times 198 \\times ... \\times 101}{100 \\times 99 \\times 98 \\times ... \\times 1}$.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the prime factors of $n$\nTo find the prime factors of $n$, we need to consider the prime factorization of the numbers in the numerator and denominator. Since we are looking for the largest 2-digit prime factor, we can focus on the prime numbers between 10 and 99.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the largest 2-digit prime factor\nThe largest 2-digit prime number is 97. We need to check if 97 is a factor of $n$. Since 97 is a prime number and it is less than 200, it will be included in the numerator of the expression for $n$. We also need to check if 97 is a factor of the denominator, which is $100!$. Since 97 is a prime number greater than 100/2, it is not a factor of $100!$.\n\n## Step 6: Confirm that 97 is indeed a factor of $n$\nAs 97 is included in the numerator and not in the denominator, it will be a factor of $n$. Since 97 is the largest 2-digit prime number and it is a factor of $n$, it is the largest 2-digit prime factor of $n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{97}$"
