    "problem": "Each of the $2001$ students at a high school studies either Spanish or French, and some study both. The number who study Spanish is between $80$ percent and $85$ percent of the school population, and the number who study French is between $30$ percent and $40$ percent. Let $m$ be the smallest number of students who could study both languages, and let $M$ be the largest number of students who could study both languages. Find $M-m$.\n",
    "solution": "Let $S$ be the percent of people who study Spanish, $F$ be the number of people who study French, and let $S \\cup F$ be the number of students who study both. Then $\\left\\lceil 80\\% \\cdot 2001 \\right\\rceil = 1601 \\le S \\le \\left\\lfloor 85\\% \\cdot 2001 \\right\\rfloor = 1700$, and $\\left\\lceil 30\\% \\cdot 2001 \\right\\rceil = 601 \\le F \\le \\left\\lfloor 40\\% \\cdot 2001 \\right\\rfloor = 800$. By the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion,\n\\[S+F- S \\cap F = S \\cup F = 2001\\]\nFor $m = S \\cap F$ to be smallest, $S$ and $F$ must be minimized.\n\\[1601 + 601 - m = 2001 \\Longrightarrow m = 201\\]\nFor $M = S \\cap F$ to be largest, $S$ and $F$ must be maximized.\n\\[1700 + 800 - M = 2001 \\Longrightarrow M = 499\\]\nTherefore, the answer is $M - m = 499 - 201 = \\boxed{298}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the variables for the problem\nLet's denote S as the number of students studying Spanish and F as the number of students studying French.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the range for the number of students studying Spanish\nGiven that the number of students studying Spanish is between 80% and 85% of the total school population (2001 students), we can calculate the range for S. The minimum number of students studying Spanish is 80% of 2001, which is $0.8 \\times 2001 = 1600.8$. Since the number of students must be an integer, the minimum value for S is 1601. The maximum number of students studying Spanish is 85% of 2001, which is $0.85 \\times 2001 = 1700.85$. The maximum value for S is 1700.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the range for the number of students studying French\nGiven that the number of students studying French is between 30% and 40% of the total school population (2001 students), we can calculate the range for F. The minimum number of students studying French is 30% of 2001, which is $0.3 \\times 2001 = 600.3$. The minimum value for F is 601. The maximum number of students studying French is 40% of 2001, which is $0.4 \\times 2001 = 800.4$. The maximum value for F is 800.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the range for the number of students studying both languages\nTo find the smallest and largest number of students who could study both languages, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The total number of students studying either Spanish or French (or both) is given by $S + F - B = 2001$, where B is the number of students studying both languages.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the smallest number of students who could study both languages, m\nThe smallest value of B (m) occurs when S is minimized and F is minimized. Thus, $m = 1601 + 601 - 2001 = 201$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the largest number of students who could study both languages, M\nThe largest value of B (M) occurs when S is maximized and F is maximized. Thus, $M = 1700 + 800 - 2001 = 499$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate M - m\nNow, we need to find $M - m$ to get the final answer. $M - m = 499 - 201 = 298$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{298}$"
