They fall into three categories: there are those which are entirely contained within a single face of the cube (whose sides are two edges and one face diagonal), those which lie in a plane perpendicular to one face of the cube (whose sides are one edge, one face diagonal and one space diagonal of the cube) and those which lie in a plane oblique to the edges of the cube, whose sides are three face diagonals of the cube.\nEach face of the cube contains ${4\\choose 3} = 4$ triangles of the first type, and there are $6$ faces, so there are $24$ triangles of the first type. Each of these is a right triangle with legs of length $1$, so each triangle of the first type has area $\\frac 12$.\nEach edge of the cube is a side of exactly $2$ of the triangles of the second type, and there are $12$ edges, so there are $24$ triangles of the second type.

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe problem asks us to find the sum of the areas of all triangles whose vertices are also vertices of a $1$ by $1$ by $1$ cube. The sum is given in the form $m + \\sqrt{n} + \\sqrt{p}$, where $m, n,$ and $p$ are integers. We need to find $m + n + p$.\n\n## Step 2: Identifying the Triangles\nWe start by identifying the triangles that can be formed using the vertices of the cube. Since there are $8$ vertices, there are ${8 \\choose 3} = 56$ total triangles to consider.\n\n## Step 3: Categorizing the Triangles\nThese triangles can be categorized based on their position in relation to the cube. The categories are: triangles contained within a single face of the cube (type 1), triangles lying in a plane perpendicular to one face of the cube (type 2), and triangles lying in a plane oblique to the edges of the cube (type 3).\n\n## Step 4: Calculating the Areas of Type 1 Triangles\nFor type 1, each face of the cube contains ${4\\choose 3} = 4$ triangles of the first type, leading to a total of $24$ triangles of this type. Each of these is a right triangle with legs of length $1$, yielding an area of $\\frac{1}{2}$ for each type 1 triangle.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the Areas of Type 2 Triangles\nFor type 2, each edge of the cube is associated with exactly $2$ triangles of the second type, giving a total of $24$ triangles of this type. Each of these also forms a right triangle, but with legs of length $1$ and $\\sqrt 2$, yielding an area of $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ for each type 2 triangle.\n\n## Step 6: Calculating the Areas of Type 3 Triangles\nFor type 3, each vertex of the cube is associated with exactly one triangle of the third type. Thus, there are $8$ triangles of this type. Each of these equilateral triangles has sides of length $\\sqrt 2$, resulting in an area of $\\frac{\\sqrt 3}{2}$ for each type 3 triangle.\n\n## Step 7: Calculating the Total Area\nThe total area of all these triangles is $24 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 24 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + 8 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 12 + 12\\sqrt2 + 4\\sqrt3 = 12 + \\sqrt{288} + \\sqrt{48}$.\n\n## Step 8: Finding $m + n + p$\nComparing this to the given form $m + \\sqrt{n} + \\sqrt{p}$, we have $m = 12$, $n = 288$, and $p = 48$. Therefore, $m + n + p = 12 + 288 + 48 = 348$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{348}$"
