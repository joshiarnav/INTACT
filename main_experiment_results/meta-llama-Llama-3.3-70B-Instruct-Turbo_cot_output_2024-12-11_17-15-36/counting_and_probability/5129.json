    "problem": "A paperboy delivers newspapers to 10 houses along Main Street. Wishing to save effort, he doesn't always deliver to every house, but to avoid being fired he never misses three consecutive houses. Compute the number of ways the paperboy could deliver papers in this manner.\n",
    "solution": "We can find a recursion. Let $D_n$ be the number of legal delivery sequences for $n$ houses. If a sequence ends with a delivery, we simply append one to $D_{n - 1}$. If it ends in $1$ nondelivery, we append a nondelivery and a delivery to $D_{n - 2}$. If it ends in $2$ nondeliveries, we append them and a delivery to $D_{n - 3}$. So\n$D_n = D_{n - 1} + D_{n - 2} + D_{n - 3}$.\nThus, since clearly $D_1 = 2$, $D_2 = 4$, $D_3 = 7$, we have $D_4 = 13$, $D_5 = 24$, $D_6 = 44$, $D_7 = 81$, $D_8 = 149$, $D_9 = 274$, $D_{10} = \\boxed{504}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem and understand the constraints\nThe paperboy needs to deliver papers to 10 houses but never misses three consecutive houses. We are looking to find the number of ways he can deliver papers under this constraint.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the approach to solve the problem\nThis problem can be approached using recursion or dynamic programming, as it involves finding a pattern or sequence that adheres to a specific rule (not missing three consecutive houses).\n\n## Step 3: Establish the base cases for the recursion or dynamic programming\nLet's denote $a_n$ as the number of ways to deliver papers to $n$ houses without missing three consecutive houses. The base cases are:\n- $a_1 = 2$ (either deliver or not to the first house)\n- $a_2 = 4$ (for two houses, the possibilities are: deliver to both, deliver to the first and not the second, deliver to the second and not the first, or deliver to neither)\n- $a_3 = 7$ (for three houses, the possibilities include all combinations except missing all three)\n\n## Step 4: Determine the recursive relationship\nFor $n > 3$, the number of ways $a_n$ can be calculated based on the previous values:\n- If the paperboy delivers to the $n^{th}$ house, he can do so from any of the $a_{n-1}$ ways of delivering to the previous $n-1$ houses.\n- If the paperboy does not deliver to the $n^{th}$ house but delivers to the $(n-1)^{th}$, he can do so from any of the $a_{n-2}$ ways of delivering to the houses before the $(n-1)^{th}$.\n- If the paperboy does not deliver to the $n^{th}$ or the $(n-1)^{th}$ house but delivers to the $(n-2)^{th}$, he can do so from any of the $a_{n-3}$ ways of delivering to the houses before the $(n-2)^{th}$.\nThus, the recursive relationship is $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the recursive relationship to find $a_{10}$\nWe need to calculate $a_4, a_5, ..., a_{10}$ using the recursive formula $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$, starting from the base cases $a_1 = 2$, $a_2 = 4$, and $a_3 = 7$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $a_4$ to $a_{10}$\n$a_4 = a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = 7 + 4 + 2 = 13$,\n$a_5 = a_4 + a_3 + a_2 = 13 + 7 + 4 = 24$,\n$a_6 = a_5 + a_4 + a_3 = 24 + 13 + 7 = 44$,\n$a_7 = a_6 + a_5 + a_4 = 44 + 24 + 13 = 81$,\n$a_8 = a_7 + a_6 + a_5 = 81 + 44 + 24 = 149$,\n$a_9 = a_8 + a_7 + a_6 = 149 + 81 + 44 = 274$,\n$a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 + a_7 = 274 + 149 + 81 = 504$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{504}$"
