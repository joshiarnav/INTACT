    "problem": "License plates from different states follow different alpha-numeric formats, which dictate which characters of a plate must be letters and which must be numbers. Florida has license plates with an alpha-numeric format like the one pictured. North Dakota, on the other hand, has a different format, also pictured. Assuming all 10 digits are equally likely to appear in the numeric positions, and all 26 letters are equally likely to appear in the alpha positions, how many more license plates can Florida issue than North Dakota?

    "solution": "Florida issues license plates in which the first three and last slots are filled with letters, and the fourth and fifth are filled with digits. Thus, there are $26^4 \\cdot 10^2$ Florida license plates possible. North Dakota, however, issues license plates in which the first three slots are filled with letters and the last three slots are filled with digits. There are thus $26^3 \\cdot 10^3$ possible North Dakota license plates. Multiplying these out and taking the difference yields an answer of $\\boxed{28121600}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the format of Florida's license plates\nFlorida's license plates have three letters, followed by two numbers, and then one letter.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of license plates Florida can issue\nFor each of the three letters, there are 26 possibilities. For each of the two numbers, there are 10 possibilities. For the last letter, there are 26 possibilities. So the total number of license plates Florida can issue is $26 \\times 26 \\times 26 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 26 = 26^3 \\times 10^2 \\times 26 = 26^4 \\times 10^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Understand the format of North Dakota's license plates\nNorth Dakota's license plates have three letters, followed by three numbers.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of license plates North Dakota can issue\nFor each of the three letters, there are 26 possibilities. For each of the three numbers, there are 10 possibilities. So the total number of license plates North Dakota can issue is $26 \\times 26 \\times 26 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 26^3 \\times 10^3$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the difference in the number of license plates that can be issued by Florida and North Dakota\nThe difference is $26^4 \\times 10^2 - 26^3 \\times 10^3$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression\n$26^4 \\times 10^2 - 26^3 \\times 10^3 = 26^3 \\times 26 \\times 10^2 - 26^3 \\times 10^3 = 26^3 \\times 10^2 \\times (26 - 10) = 26^3 \\times 10^2 \\times 16$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the value\n$26^3 = 17576$, $10^2 = 100$, and $16$ remains the same. So, $17576 \\times 100 \\times 16 = 28121600$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28121600}$"
