    "problem": "An integer greater than 9 and less than 100 is randomly chosen. What is the probability that its digits are different?",
    "solution": "We calculate the probability that the digits are the same, and subtract from 1. From the 90 integers to be chosen from, only 9 have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, ..., 99. Therefore, the probability that the digits are the same is $\\frac{9}{90} = \\frac{1}{10}$, so the probability that the digits are different is $1-\\frac{1}{10}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of integers between 9 and 100.\nThere are 90 integers in total from 10 to 99, since 10 is the smallest two-digit integer and 99 is the largest.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of integers where the digits are the same.\nFor the integers between 10 and 99, the numbers where the digits are the same are 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99. That makes a total of 9 integers.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of integers where the digits are different.\nThe total number of integers with different digits can be found by subtracting the number of integers with the same digits from the total number of integers. So, 90 total integers - 9 integers with the same digits = 81 integers with different digits.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that a randomly chosen integer has different digits.\nThe probability is calculated by dividing the number of integers with different digits by the total number of integers. So, the probability = 81 / 90.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the fraction if possible.\nThe fraction 81 / 90 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9. So, 81 / 9 = 9 and 90 / 9 = 10. The simplified fraction is 9 / 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$"
