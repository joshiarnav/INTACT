    "problem": "Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards (13 hearts, 13 clubs, 13 spades, and 13 diamonds).  What is the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen?",
    "solution": "The probability that the first card is a 6 is $\\dfrac{1}{13}$.  There are then 51 cards remaining, so the probability the second card is a Queen is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  The answer is then $\\dfrac{1}{13} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{663}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the probability of the first card being a 6\nThere are 52 cards in total, and 4 of them are 6s (one in each suit: hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds). So, the probability of the first card being a 6 is 4/52, which simplifies to 1/13.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of the second card being a Queen given the first card is a 6\nAfter the first card is dealt, there are 51 cards remaining in the deck. Since there are 4 Queens in the deck (one in each suit), the probability of drawing a Queen as the second card is 4/51.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the overall probability of both events happening in sequence\nTo find the overall probability of both events happening (the first card being a 6 and the second card being a Queen), we multiply the probabilities of each event happening in sequence. So, the overall probability is (1/13) * (4/51).\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the overall probability\nMultiplying the fractions (1/13) * (4/51) gives 4/(13*51), which simplifies to 4/663.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{663}}$"
