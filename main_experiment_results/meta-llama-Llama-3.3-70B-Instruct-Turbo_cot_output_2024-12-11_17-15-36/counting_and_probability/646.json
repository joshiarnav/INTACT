    "problem": "A Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans. Assuming all politicians are distinguishable, in how many ways can they sit around a circular table without restrictions?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "There are 10 people to place, so we can place them in $10!$ ways, but this counts each valid arrangement 10 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement).  So the number of ways to seat them is $\\dfrac{10!}{10} = 9! = \\boxed{362,\\!880}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe problem asks us to find the number of ways 10 distinguishable politicians (5 Democrats and 5 Republicans) can sit around a circular table without any restrictions. Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.\n\n## Step 2: Calculating Total Arrangements Without Restrictions\nFirst, if the politicians were arranged in a line, the total number of arrangements would be 10!. This is because there are 10 choices for the first seat, 9 choices for the second seat, and so on, until there is only 1 choice for the last seat.\n\n## Step 3: Accounting for Circular Arrangement\nSince the table is circular, arrangements that are rotations of each other are considered the same. For any given arrangement, there are 10 rotations that result in the same seating (including the original arrangement). Therefore, to account for this, we divide the total number of linear arrangements by the number of people (10) to get the number of unique circular arrangements.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate Unique Circular Arrangements\nThe formula to calculate the unique circular arrangements is (10!)/10. Simplifying this gives 9!, which is the number of unique ways the politicians can sit around the circular table.\n\n## Step 5: Compute 9!\n9! = 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 362,880.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{362880}$"
