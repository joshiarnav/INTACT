    "problem": "I have 10 distinguishable socks in my drawer: 4 white, 4 brown, and 2 blue.  In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of the same color?",
    "solution": "The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue.  If the socks are white, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are brown, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are blue, there is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ choice.  So the total number of choices for socks is $6 + 6 + 1 = \\boxed{13}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the different color combinations for pairs of socks.\nTo get a pair of socks of the same color, we have three options: two white socks, two brown socks, or two blue socks.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose two white socks.\nSince we have 4 white socks and we want to choose 2 of them, we use the combination formula, which is $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$. For white socks, this becomes $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\cdot 2} = 6$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose two brown socks.\nSimilarly, for the 4 brown socks, using the combination formula, we get $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\cdot 2} = 6$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose two blue socks.\nFor the 2 blue socks, using the combination formula, we get $\\binom{2}{2} = \\frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Add up all the ways to choose pairs of socks of the same color.\nTo find the total number of ways, we add the results from steps 2, 3, and 4: $6 + 6 + 1 = 13$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$"
