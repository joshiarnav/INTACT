    "problem": "Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace?",
    "solution": "We have two cases because if the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$, it could be an ace or not be an ace.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{3}{51} = \\dfrac{1}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the three remaining aces, which gives a probability of $\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot \\dfrac{1}{17} = \\dfrac{1}{884}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{12}{52} = \\dfrac{3}{13}$ chance that a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the ace is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{4}{51}$ chance that an ace is drawn second, giving a $\\dfrac{3}{13}\\cdot \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{4}{221}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nSo the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\\dfrac{1}{884} + \\dfrac{4}{221} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}$.\n\nNotice that we can avoid some of the large denominators above by organizing this computation as follows: $$\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{3}{51}+\\dfrac{12}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{1\\cdot 3+12\\cdot 4}{52\\cdot 51} = \\dfrac{51}{52\\cdot 51}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}.$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the probability of the first card being a $\\diamondsuit$\nThe probability of drawing a $\\diamondsuit$ from a standard deck of 52 cards as the first card is $\\frac{13}{52}$ because there are 13 diamonds in a deck of 52 cards.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of the second card being an ace\nAfter drawing the first card, there are 51 cards left in the deck. The probability of drawing an ace as the second card depends on two scenarios:\n- If the first card drawn was the ace of diamonds, then there are 3 aces left in the deck.\n- If the first card drawn was any diamond other than the ace, then there are 4 aces left in the deck.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability for each scenario\n### Scenario 1: First card is the ace of diamonds\nThe probability of drawing the ace of diamonds first is $\\frac{1}{52}$. Then, the probability of drawing an ace as the second card is $\\frac{3}{51}$ because there are 3 aces left.\n\n### Scenario 2: First card is any diamond other than the ace\nThe probability of drawing any diamond other than the ace first is $\\frac{12}{52}$. Then, the probability of drawing an ace as the second card is $\\frac{4}{51}$ because there are 4 aces left.\n\n## Step 4: Combine the probabilities of both scenarios\nTo find the total probability of the first card being a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card being an ace, we add the probabilities of the two scenarios:\n\\[P = \\left(\\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{12}{52} \\times \\frac{4}{51}\\right)\\]\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression\n\\[P = \\frac{3}{2652} + \\frac{48}{2652}\\]\n\\[P = \\frac{51}{2652}\\]\n\\[P = \\frac{1}{52}\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{52}}$"
