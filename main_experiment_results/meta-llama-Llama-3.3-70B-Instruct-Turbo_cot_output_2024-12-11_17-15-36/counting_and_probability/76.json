    "problem": "Seven people arrive to dinner, but the circular table only seats six.  If two seatings such that one is a rotation of the other are considered the same, then in how many different ways can we choose six people and seat them at the table?",
    "solution": "There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing.  To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person.  This suggests that there are $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people.  However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count.  Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table.  There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe have 7 people and a circular table that seats 6. The task is to determine the number of different ways we can choose 6 people out of the 7 and seat them at the table, considering rotations of the same seating as the same arrangement.\n\n## Step 2: Choose 6 people out of 7\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 6 people out of 7. This is a combination problem, where the order of selection does not matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. For our case, n = 7 and k = 6.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 6 people out of 7\nUsing the combination formula, we find C(7, 6) = 7! / [6!(7-6)!] = 7! / (6! * 1!) = 7.\n\n## Step 4: Seat the chosen 6 people at the circular table\nOnce we have chosen 6 people, we need to seat them at the circular table. The number of ways to arrange n distinct objects in a circle is (n-1)!, because we can fix one person's position and arrange the rest relative to that person. In our case, n = 6.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to seat 6 people at the circular table\nUsing the formula for circular permutations, we find the number of ways to seat 6 people is (6-1)! = 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of different seatings\nTo find the total number of different seatings, we multiply the number of ways to choose 6 people out of 7 by the number of ways to seat them at the table. Total = C(7, 6) * 5! = 7 * 120.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the final answer\nTotal = 7 * 120 = 840.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{840}$"
