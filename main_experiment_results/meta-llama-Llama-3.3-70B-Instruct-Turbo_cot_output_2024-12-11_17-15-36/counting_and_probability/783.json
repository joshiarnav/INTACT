    "solution": "We consider the unordered pairs, or sets, of spins for which the difference of the numbers are greater than or equal to 3, or those games which Jane loses. These can only occur in the sets $\\{1, 4\\}$, $\\{1, 5 \\}$ or $\\{ 2, 5 \\}$. Each of these unordered pairs can occur in 2 orderings (depending on whether Jane or her brother spins each number). So, there are $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ losing combinations out of $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ for Jane. So, her winning probability is $1 - \\frac{6}{25} = \\boxed{\\frac{19}{25}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes when Jane and her brother spin the spinner once.\nSince the spinner has five congruent sectors, each numbered from 1 to 5, there are 5 possible outcomes for each spin. With Jane and her brother each spinning the spinner once, the total number of outcomes is 5 * 5 = 25.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the winning conditions for Jane.\nJane wins if the non-negative difference of their numbers is less than 3. This means she will win in the following cases: (1) when the numbers are the same, (2) when the difference is 1, and (3) when the difference is 2.\n\n## Step 3: Enumerate the winning outcomes for Jane based on the conditions identified.\n- For the numbers being the same, the winning outcomes are (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), and (5,5). That's 5 outcomes.\n- For a difference of 1, the winning outcomes are (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,3), (4,5), and (5,4). That's 8 outcomes.\n- For a difference of 2, the winning outcomes are (1,3), (3,1), (2,4), (4,2), (3,5), and (5,3). That's 6 outcomes.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of winning outcomes for Jane.\nAdding the outcomes from Step 3: 5 (same number) + 8 (difference of 1) + 6 (difference of 2) = 19 winning outcomes.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that Jane wins.\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes (Jane winning) divided by the total number of outcomes. So, the probability = 19 / 25.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{19}{25}}$"
