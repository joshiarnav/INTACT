    "problem": "A math conference is presenting a lecture series with six different lecturers. If Dr. Smith's lecture depends on Dr. Jones's lecture, so that Dr. Smith must be scheduled at some time after Dr. Jones, in how many orders can the six lecturers be scheduled?",
    "solution": "There are a total of $6!$ ways to order the 6 lectures with no restriction. By symmetry, exactly half of these will have Dr. Jones's lecture before Dr. Smith's lecture. Thus there are $6!/2 = \\boxed{360}$ ways to schedule the conference.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of lecturers\nThere are six different lecturers that need to be scheduled.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of possible orders without any restrictions\nTo find the total number of possible orders for six lecturers without any restrictions, we use the factorial of the number of lecturers. This is because each position in the schedule can be filled by any of the remaining lecturers. So, the total number of possible orders is 6! (6 factorial), which equals 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n\n## Step 3: Account for the restriction that Dr. Smith must be scheduled after Dr. Jones\nGiven the restriction that Dr. Smith must be scheduled after Dr. Jones, exactly half of the total possible orders will meet this criterion. This is because for every schedule where Dr. Jones is scheduled before Dr. Smith, there is a corresponding schedule where their positions are reversed, violating the restriction.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of orders that meet the restriction\nSince half of the total possible orders will have Dr. Jones scheduled before Dr. Smith, we divide the total number of possible orders by 2. So, the number of orders that meet the restriction is 720 / 2 = 360.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{360}$"
