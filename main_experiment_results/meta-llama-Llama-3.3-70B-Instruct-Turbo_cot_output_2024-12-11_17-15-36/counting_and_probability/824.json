    "problem": "I have a drawer with 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives in it. If I reach in and randomly remove three pieces of silverware, what is the probability that I get one fork, one spoon, and one knife?",
    "solution": "First, we can find the denominator of our fraction.  There are a total of $\\dbinom{18}{3}=816$ ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware out of 18.  To find the numerator, we need to count the number of ways to choose one piece of each type of silverware.  There are 6 ways we could choose a fork, 6 ways to choose a spoon, and 6 ways to choose a knife, making a total of $6\\cdot 6 \\cdot 6=216$ ways to choose a fork, a knife, and a spoon so our final probability is $\\frac{216}{816}=\\boxed{\\frac{9}{34}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware out of 18.\nTo find the total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware out of 18, we use the combination formula: $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. So, $C(18, 3) = \\frac{18!}{3!(18-3)!} = \\frac{18*17*16}{3*2*1} = 816$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife.\nThere are 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives. The number of ways to choose one of each is $6 * 6 * 6 = 216$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of choosing one fork, one spoon, and one knife.\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. So, the probability is $\\frac{216}{816}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the fraction.\nSimplifying the fraction $\\frac{216}{816}$ gives $\\frac{27}{102}$, which simplifies further to $\\frac{9}{34}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{34}}$"
