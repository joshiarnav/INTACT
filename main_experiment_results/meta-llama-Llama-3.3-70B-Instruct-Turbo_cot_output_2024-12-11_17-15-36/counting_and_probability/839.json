    "problem": "Define a $\\it{good\\ word}$ as a sequence of letters that consists only of the letters $A$, $B$, and $C$ --- some of these letters may not appear in the sequence --- and in which $A$ is never immediately followed by $B$, $B$ is never immediately followed by $C$, and $C$ is never immediately followed by $A$. How many seven-letter good words are there?",
    "solution": "There are three choices for the first letter and two choices for each subsequent letter, so there are $3\\cdot2^{n-1}\\ n$-letter good words.  Substitute $n=7$ to find there are $3\\cdot2^6=\\boxed{192}$ seven-letter good words.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem and the constraints for a \"good word\"\nA good word is a sequence of letters that consists only of the letters $A$, $B$, and $C$, with the constraints that $A$ cannot be immediately followed by $B$, $B$ cannot be immediately followed by $C$, and $C$ cannot be immediately followed by $A$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of choices for the first letter\nFor the first letter of the sequence, we have 3 choices: $A$, $B$, or $C$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of choices for each subsequent letter\nAfter choosing the first letter, for each subsequent letter, we have 2 choices because once we've chosen a letter, there is only one letter that cannot follow it according to the rules. For example, if we start with $A$, we cannot have $B$ next, so we can choose $A$ or $C$. This pattern holds for any starting letter due to the cyclic nature of the constraints.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of seven-letter good words\nSince we have 3 choices for the first letter and 2 choices for each of the subsequent 6 letters, the total number of seven-letter good words can be calculated by multiplying these choices together: $3 \\times 2^6$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the calculation\n$3 \\times 2^6 = 3 \\times 64 = 192$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{192}$"
