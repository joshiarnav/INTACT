    "problem": "A bag contains 3 tan, 2 pink and 4 violet chips. If the 9 chips are randomly drawn from the bag, one at a time and without replacement, what is the probability that the chips are drawn in such a way that the 3 tan chips are drawn consecutively, the 2 pink chips are drawn consecutively, and the 4 violet chips are drawn consecutively, but not necessarily in the tan-pink-violet order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We count the number of ways to draw the tan chips consecutively, the pink chips consecutively, and the violet chips consecutively (although not necessarily in that order).  First of all, we can draw the tan chips in $3!$ ways, the pink chips in $2!$ ways, and the violet chips in $4!$ ways.  We can choose our drawing order (e.g pink-tan-violet) in $3!$ ways.  Thus we have $3!2!4!3!$ satisfying arrangements and $9!$ total ways of drawing the chips.  So our answer is $\\frac{3!2!4!3!}{9!} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{210}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Step 1 description\nFirst, we need to consider the total number of ways to draw the 9 chips from the bag without replacement. Since the chips are distinct in color, we can calculate this by using the factorial of the total number of chips, which is 9!. This is because for the first draw, we have 9 options, for the second draw, we have 8 options, and so on, until the last draw, where we have only 1 option left.\n\n## Step 2: Step 2 description\nNext, we consider the constraints given in the problem. The 3 tan chips must be drawn consecutively, the 2 pink chips must be drawn consecutively, and the 4 violet chips must be drawn consecutively. We can think of each set of consecutive chips as a single unit. Therefore, instead of having 9 individual chips, we now have 3 units (1 unit of tan chips, 1 unit of pink chips, and 1 unit of violet chips) that need to be arranged.\n\n## Step 3: Step 3 description\nThe number of ways to arrange these 3 units is 3!. However, within each unit, the chips of the same color can also be arranged among themselves. For the tan chips, there are 3! ways to arrange them, for the pink chips, there are 2! ways, and for the violet chips, there are 4! ways.\n\n## Step 4: Step 4 description\nTo find the total number of favorable arrangements (where each color is drawn consecutively), we multiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange the chips within each unit. This gives us 3! * 3! * 2! * 4!.\n\n## Step 5: Step 5 description\nThe probability of drawing the chips in such a way that the 3 tan chips are drawn consecutively, the 2 pink chips are drawn consecutively, and the 4 violet chips are drawn consecutively is the ratio of the number of favorable arrangements to the total number of possible arrangements. This can be calculated as (3! * 3! * 2! * 4!) / 9!.\n\n## Step 6: Step 6 description\nWe simplify the expression (3! * 3! * 2! * 4!) / 9! to calculate the actual probability. First, calculate the factorials: 3! = 6, 2! = 2, 4! = 24, and 9! = 362,880. Then, substitute these values into the expression to get (6 * 6 * 2 * 24) / 362,880.\n\n## Step 7: Step 7 description\nPerform the multiplication in the numerator: 6 * 6 * 2 * 24 = 1728. Then, divide this by the denominator: 1728 / 362,880.\n\n## Step 8: Step 8 description\nSimplify the fraction 1728 / 362,880 to its simplest form by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and dividing both by this GCD.\n\n## Step 9: Step 9 description\nThe GCD of 1728 and 362,880 is 144. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 144: (1728 / 144) / (362,880 / 144) = 12 / 2520.\n\n## Step 10: Step 10 description\nFurther simplify the fraction 12 / 2520 by finding their GCD, which is 12. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 12: (12 / 12) / (2520 / 12) = 1 / 210.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{210}}$"
