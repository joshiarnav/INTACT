    "solution": "Clearly one color isn't enough; $\\boxed{2}$ colors will work because the tessellation shown is topologically identical to a chessboard (that is, imagine straightening out the diagonal lines to form an array of squares. This process doesn't change which tiles share a side.).",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the concept of tessellations and the conditions given for coloring them.\n## Step 2:  A tessellation is a repeating pattern of shapes that fit together without overlapping. In this case, the tessellation is made up of hexagonal tiles.\n## Step 3:  The condition given is that no two tiles sharing a side should be the same color. This means that adjacent tiles must have different colors.\n## Step 4:  Looking at the tessellation, we notice that each hexagonal tile shares sides with six neighboring tiles.\n## Step 5:  To find the minimum number of colors needed, we can start by coloring one tile and then determine the colors of its neighboring tiles based on the given condition.\n## Step 6:  If we color the first tile with color A, then all its neighboring tiles must be colored with a different color, let's say color B.\n## Step 7:  Now, for the tiles neighboring the ones colored with B, they can be colored with color A, as they do not share a side with the first tile colored with A.\n## Step 8:  Continuing this pattern, we can alternate between colors A and B for the entire tessellation.\n## Step 9:  This means that only two colors are needed to shade the tessellation such that no two tiles sharing a side have the same color.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the least number of colors needed is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
