    "problem": "When two fair 6-sided dice are tossed, the numbers $a$ and $b$ are obtained. What is the probability that the two digit number $ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) and $a$ and $b$ are all divisible by 3?",
    "solution": "$ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) is divisible by 3 only when $a+b$ is divisible by 3. Since 3 divides both $a$ and $a+b$, 3 must divide $b$. Therefore, $a$ and $b$ can equal 3 or 6. The probability that $a$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. The probability that $b$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. Therefore, The probability that both $a$ and $b$ equal 3 or 6 is $\\left(\\frac13\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac19}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of outcomes when two fair 6-sided dice are tossed.\nWhen two dice are tossed, each can result in 6 different outcomes. Therefore, the total number of outcomes for two dice is 6 * 6 = 36.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the favorable outcomes where both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 3.\nFor a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Since $a$ and $b$ are digits from 1 to 6 (because they are the results of a dice toss), the numbers divisible by 3 are 3 and 6. \n\n## Step 3: List all the possible combinations of $a$ and $b$ where both are divisible by 3.\nThe possible combinations are (3,3), (3,6), (6,3), and (6,6). These combinations make the two-digit number $ab$ also divisible by 3 because both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 3.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability of getting these favorable outcomes.\nThere are 4 favorable outcomes as listed in Step 3. The total number of outcomes is 36 as determined in Step 1. Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 4 / 36.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the fraction obtained in Step 4.\nThe fraction 4 / 36 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4. Simplifying gives 1 / 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$"
