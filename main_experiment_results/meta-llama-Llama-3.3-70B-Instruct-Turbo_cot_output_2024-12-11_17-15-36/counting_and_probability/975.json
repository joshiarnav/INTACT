    "solution": "The hexagons in the second column to the left must be yellow and green, but either color can be on top: 2 possibilities. With either possibility, the rest of the figure is easily colored in, with the color of every other hexagon being forced.  (ex. In the third column, the middle hexagon must be red, and the top and bottom must be the opposite of the top and bottom in the second column)  Thus, there are only $\\boxed{2}$ possibilities.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem.\nThe problem states that each hexagon is colored either red, yellow, or green, such that no two hexagons with a common side are colored the same color. We are given that one of the hexagons is colored red.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the hexagons that are directly affected by the red hexagon.\nThe hexagons directly adjacent to the red hexagon cannot be red, so they must be either yellow or green. Since there are two hexagons directly adjacent to the red hexagon, there are two possibilities for the color of the first adjacent hexagon (yellow or green), which then determines the color of the second adjacent hexagon.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the possible color combinations for the rest of the hexagons.\nAfter determining the colors of the hexagons adjacent to the red one, the rest of the hexagons can be colored based on the constraint that no two hexagons with a common side have the same color. The colors of the remaining hexagons will be forced by the initial choices, given the constraint.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of possible color combinations.\nWe need to consider the number of choices at each step and multiply them together to find the total number of possible color combinations.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the calculations to find the final answer.\nGiven the initial red hexagon, there are 2 choices for the color of the first adjacent hexagon (yellow or green), which then determines the color of the second adjacent hexagon. The colors of the remaining hexagons are then forced by the initial choices. So, the total number of possible color combinations is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
