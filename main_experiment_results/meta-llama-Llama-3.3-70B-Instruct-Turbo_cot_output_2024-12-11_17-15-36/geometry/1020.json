    "solution": "[asy]\nsize(2.5inch);\npair A,B,C,D,E;\nA = (-3,4);\nB = (5,4);\nC = (4,0);\nD = (0,0);\nE = intersectionpoint(A--C, B--D);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle); draw(A--C); draw(B--D);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW); label(\"$B$\", B, NE); label(\"$C$\", C, SE); label(\"$D$\", D, SW); label(\"$E$\", E, N);\n[/asy] We will write the area of triangle $XYZ$ as $[XYZ].$  Since triangles $ADC$ and $BCD$ share a base and have the same altitude length to that base, they have the same area. Since $[BCD] = [ADC]$, we have $[BCE] + [CDE] = [ADE] + [CDE]$, so  $[BCE] = [ADE] = 20$.\n\nTo find the area of triangle $CDE$, we note that triangles $CDE$ and $ABE$ are similar, and the ratio of their sides is $DE/BE$. Triangles $ADE$ and $ABE$ share an altitude, so $DE/BE = [ADE]/[ABE] = 20/50 = 2/5$. Since the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their sides, $[CDE]/[ABE] = (DE/BE)^2 = 4/25$, and $[CDE] = (4/25)[ABE] = (4/25)(50) = 8$. Thus, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $[ABE] + [ADE] + [BCE] + [CDE] = 50+20+20+8 = \\boxed{98}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and recall the properties of a trapezoid.\nWe are dealing with a trapezoid $ABCD$ where $AB$ is parallel to $CD$, and the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$. The area of triangle $ABE$ is given as 50 square units, and the area of triangle $ADE$ is given as 20 square units. We need to find the area of the trapezoid $ABCD$.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize the relationship between the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ and the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$.\nSince $AB$ is parallel to $CD$, the height of both triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ is the same, as it is the perpendicular distance between the parallel bases $AB$ and $CD$. Let's denote this common height as $h$. The ratio of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ is equal to the ratio of their bases $AB$ and $AD$. Given that the area of triangle $ABE$ is 50 and the area of triangle $ADE$ is 20, the ratio of $AB$ to $AD$ is $50:20$ or $5:2$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the ratio of the bases to find the ratio of the areas of triangles $CDE$ and $BCE$.\nSince the diagonals of a trapezoid divide each other proportionally, the ratio of $CE$ to $EA$ is the same as the ratio of $AB$ to $AD$, which is $5:2$. This implies that the ratio of the areas of triangles $CDE$ and $BCE$ is also $5:2$ because they share the same height (the perpendicular distance between $CD$ and $AB$).\n\n## Step 4: Determine the areas of triangles $CDE$ and $BCE$ using the given areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$.\nGiven that the ratio of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ is $5:2$, and knowing that the area of $ABE$ is 50 and the area of $ADE$ is 20, we can deduce that the total area of triangle $ABC$ is $50 + 20 = 70$ square units. Since triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$ share a base and have the same height (because $AB$ is parallel to $CD$), the ratio of their areas is the same as the ratio of their bases. Let's denote the area of triangle $CDE$ as $x$ and the area of triangle $BCE$ as $y$. We know that $x/y = 5/2$ because of the proportional division of the diagonals.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the areas of triangles $CDE$ and $BCE$.\nSince triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ have areas 50 and 20 respectively, and the total area of $ABC$ is 70, we need to find the areas of $CDE$ and $BCE$ such that their sum plus 70 gives us the total area of the trapezoid. We are looking for a relationship that helps us find $x$ and $y$.\n\n## Step 6: Recall that the areas of triangles $BCE$ and $CDE$ are in the ratio $5:2$ and use the fact that triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$ have a common height to relate their areas.\nSince $AB$ is parallel to $CD$, the height of triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$ is the same. The area of triangle $ABC$ is 70 square units. The ratio of $AB$ to $CD$ is $5:2$ (from the ratio of the areas of $ABE$ and $ADE$), which means the ratio of the area of triangle $ADC$ to the area of triangle $ABC$ is also $5:2$ because they share the same height. This allows us to find the area of triangle $ADC$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the area of triangle $ADC$.\nGiven that the ratio of the areas of triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$ is $5:2$ and the area of $ABC$ is 70, we can calculate the area of $ADC$. Let's denote the area of $ADC$ as $A_{ADC}$. Since $A_{ABC}/A_{ADC} = 5/2$, and $A_{ABC} = 70$, we have $70/A_{ADC} = 5/2$. Solving for $A_{ADC}$ gives $A_{ADC} = 70 \\times 2 / 5 = 28$.\n\n## Step 8: Find the total area of the trapezoid $ABCD$.\nThe total area of the trapezoid $ABCD$ is the sum of the areas of triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$. We have already found that the area of $ABC$ is 70 square units and the area of $ADC$ is 28 square units (from the proportionality and the given areas of $ABE$ and $ADE$).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{98}$"
