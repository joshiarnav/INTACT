    "problem": "The area of an equilateral triangle is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides. What is the perimeter of the triangle, in units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
    "solution": "The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$. This must equal $s$. Setting the two equal and solving, we get \\begin{align*}\ns&=\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\\\\n4s&=s^2\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4 &= s\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4\\sqrt{3}&= 3s \\\\\n\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} &=s\n\\end{align*} Thus, the perimeter of the triangle is $3s=\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}} \\text{units}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle\nThe area \\(A\\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s\\) is given by \\(A = \\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}\\).\n\n## Step 2: Set up the equation based on the problem statement\nWe are told that the area of the triangle is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides. Therefore, we can set up the equation \\(\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} = s\\).\n\n## Step 3: Solve the equation for \\(s\\)\nTo solve for \\(s\\), first multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get rid of the fraction: \\(s^2 \\sqrt{3} = 4s\\).\n\n## Step 4: Rearrange the equation\nNext, rearrange the equation to set it to 0: \\(s^2 \\sqrt{3} - 4s = 0\\).\n\n## Step 5: Factor out \\(s\\)\nFactor out \\(s\\) from the equation: \\(s(\\sqrt{3}s - 4) = 0\\).\n\n## Step 6: Solve for \\(s\\)\nThis gives us two possible solutions: \\(s = 0\\) or \\(\\sqrt{3}s - 4 = 0\\). Since \\(s = 0\\) cannot be a side length, we solve \\(\\sqrt{3}s - 4 = 0\\) for \\(s\\): \\(\\sqrt{3}s = 4\\), thus \\(s = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}\\).\n\n## Step 7: Rationalize the denominator\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\): \\(s = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\).\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the perimeter of the triangle\nThe perimeter \\(P\\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s\\) is \\(P = 3s\\). Substituting \\(s = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\) into the formula gives \\(P = 3 \\times \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} = 4\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$"
