    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, we need to analyze the given problem and understand the geometric configuration described.\nThe problem involves two circles, one with a radius of 1 and the other with a radius of 2, both tangent to each other and to the sides of triangle ABC. The sides AB and AC of the triangle are congruent.\n\n## Step 2:  To find the area of triangle ABC, we can utilize the properties of tangents to circles and apply geometric reasoning to determine the necessary parameters.\nLet's denote the centers of the smaller and larger circles as O and O' respectively, and the points of tangency on AC as D and D'. Similarly, the point of tangency on AB is denoted as E, and the point of tangency on BC as F.\n\n## Step 3:  We can start by considering the tangents and radii of the circles to establish relationships between the various line segments and angles in the triangle.\nBy using the fact that tangents create right angles with radii at points of tangency, we can identify similar triangles and apply their properties to find the lengths of different segments.\n\n## Step 4:  Since the triangle is isosceles with AB = AC, we can use this information to determine the lengths of AD, CD, and other relevant segments.\nWe can also utilize the concept of similar triangles to establish a relationship between the heights of the triangles and the radii of the circles.\n\n## Step 5:  After determining the necessary lengths and relationships, we can proceed to calculate the area of triangle ABC using the formula for the area of a triangle.\nWe can use the base and height of the triangle to compute its area.\n\n## Step 6:  Let's calculate the area step by step.\nFirst, we find that AD' = 1 and CD = 2, as they are radii of the smaller and larger circles respectively.\nThen, by considering similar triangles, we establish that AD = 3 and CD' = 4.\nThis allows us to determine the height of the triangle, which is equal to the sum of AD and the radius of the smaller circle, i.e., 3 + 1 = 4, and the radius of the larger circle, i.e., 2.\nUsing the formula for the area of a triangle, we can then calculate the area as (1/2) * base * height.\n\n## Step 7:  We can now substitute the values of base and height into the area formula to obtain the final answer.\nUsing the base as 4 * sqrt(2) and height as 8, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2) * 4 * sqrt(2) * 8 / (2 * sqrt(2)) = 16 * sqrt(2) / (2 * sqrt(2)) = 16.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16\\sqrt{2}}$"
