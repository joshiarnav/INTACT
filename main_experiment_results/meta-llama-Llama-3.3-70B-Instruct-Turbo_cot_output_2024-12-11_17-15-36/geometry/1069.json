    "problem": "A triangle with side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5 is inscribed in a circle of radius 3.  What is the area of the triangle? Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $3x$, $4x$, and $5x$.  The triangle is a right triangle, so its hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle.  Thus $5x=2\\cdot 3=6$, so $x=6/5$.  The area of the triangle is \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3x\\cdot 4x =\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{18}{5}\\cdot \\frac{24}{5}\n=\\frac{216}{25}=\\boxed{8.64}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the nature of the triangle\nThe triangle in question has side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5, which is a classic example of a right-angled triangle, as it satisfies the Pythagorean theorem (3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2).\n\n## Step 2: Find the actual side lengths of the triangle\nSince the triangle is inscribed in a circle of radius 3, the hypotenuse of the triangle (the side opposite the right angle, corresponding to the ratio 5) is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is 2 * radius = 2 * 3 = 6 units. We can then find the actual side lengths by multiplying each ratio by the same factor that scales 5 to 6. This factor is 6 / 5. So, the side lengths are 3 * (6 / 5), 4 * (6 / 5), and 5 * (6 / 5), which simplifies to 18 / 5, 24 / 5, and 6.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area of the triangle\nThe area of a right-angled triangle can be found using the formula Area = 1/2 * base * height. In this case, the base and height are the two shorter sides of the triangle, which are 18 / 5 and 24 / 5. So, the area is 1/2 * (18 / 5) * (24 / 5).\n\n## Step 4: Perform the calculation\nArea = 1/2 * (18 / 5) * (24 / 5) = 1/2 * (18 * 24) / (5 * 5) = 1/2 * 432 / 25 = 216 / 25.\n\n## Step 5: Convert the fraction to a decimal and round to the nearest hundredth\nTo convert 216 / 25 to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator: 216 / 25 = 8.64.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8.64}$"
