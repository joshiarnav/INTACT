    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ has vertices with coordinates $A(2,3),$ $B(7,8),$ and $C(-4,6)$. The triangle is reflected about line $L$. The image points are $A'(2,-5),$ $B'(7,-10),$ and $C'(-4,-8)$. What is the equation of line $L$?",
    "solution": "Since only the $y$ portions of the coordinates move, we know that the line of reflection must be a horizontal line. Now we just need to find the midpoint between an original point and its reflected image to pinpoint the location of the line. The $y$-coordinate of point $A$ is 3 and the $y$-coordinate of $A'$ is $-5$; therefore, the midpoint is at $(2, -1)$. The line of refection is $\\boxed{y = -1}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the midpoint between the original points and their reflections to find a point through which line L passes.\nTo find the equation of line L, we first need to determine the midpoint between the original points and their reflections. The midpoint formula is given by $\\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right)$. Let's calculate the midpoint for points A and A', B and B', and C and C'. For A and A', the midpoint is $\\left( \\frac{2 + 2}{2}, \\frac{3 - 5}{2} \\right) = (2, -1)$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the midpoints for B and B', and C and C' to confirm the pattern.\nFor B and B', the midpoint is $\\left( \\frac{7 + 7}{2}, \\frac{8 - 10}{2} \\right) = (7, -1)$. For C and C', the midpoint is $\\left( \\frac{-4 + (-4)}{2}, \\frac{6 - 8}{2} \\right) = (-4, -1)$. These calculations show that all midpoints lie on the line $y = -1$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the equation of line L based on the midpoints calculated.\nGiven that the midpoints of the line segments connecting the original points to their reflections all have a y-coordinate of -1, it indicates that line L is horizontal and passes through the point (x, -1) for any x. Therefore, the equation of line L is $y = -1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-1}$"
