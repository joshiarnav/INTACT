    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Draw and analyze the given triangle\nFirst, we draw $\\triangle ABC$ and point $D$ as described. Given $AC = BC = 7$ and $AB = 2$, $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles. Point $D$ lies on line $AB$ with $B$ between $A$ and $D$, and $CD = 8$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to the right-angled triangles\nTo find $BD$, we need to apply the Pythagorean theorem. However, $\\triangle ABC$ is not right-angled, but we can use the altitude from $C$ to $AB$ to create right-angled triangles.\n\n## Step 3: Find the altitude of $\\triangle ABC$ from $C$ to $AB$\nLet the altitude from $C$ to $AB$ intersect $AB$ at point $E$. Since $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, $E$ is the midpoint of $AB$, making $AE = EB = 1$ because $AB = 2$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the length of $CE$\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem in $\\triangle CEB$, $CE^2 + EB^2 = CB^2$. Thus, $CE^2 + 1^2 = 7^2$, which simplifies to $CE^2 = 48$. Hence, $CE = \\sqrt{48}$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to $\\triangle CED$\nConsidering $\\triangle CED$, $CD^2 = CE^2 + ED^2$. We already know $CD = 8$ and $CE = \\sqrt{48}$. Also, $ED = BD + EB = BD + 1$ since $E$ is between $B$ and $D$.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute known values into the equation for $\\triangle CED$\nSubstituting the known values, $8^2 = (\\sqrt{48})^2 + (BD + 1)^2$. This simplifies to $64 = 48 + (BD + 1)^2$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $BD$\nFrom $64 = 48 + (BD + 1)^2$, we get $(BD + 1)^2 = 16$. Taking the square root of both sides, $BD + 1 = 4$ (since $BD$ cannot be negative in this context), which simplifies to $BD = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
