    "problem": "A hemisphere-shaped bowl with radius 1 foot is filled full with chocolate.  All of the chocolate is then evenly distributed between 27 congruent, smaller hemisphere-shaped molds.  What is the radius of each of the smaller molds, in feet?",
    "solution": "A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so a hemisphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$.  The large hemisphere-shaped bowl has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi(1^3) = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ cubic feet.\n\nLet each of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds have radius $r$.  Their total volume, in terms of $r$, is $27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$ cubic feet, so we have \\[27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi.\\]Dividing both sides by $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ yields $27r^3 =1$, so $r=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$ feet.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the volume of the large hemisphere-shaped bowl.\nThe volume \\(V\\) of a hemisphere with radius \\(r\\) is given by \\(V = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3\\). For a hemisphere with radius \\(r = 1\\) foot, the volume \\(V_{large}\\) is \\(V_{large} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi (1)^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\) cubic feet.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the volume of chocolate each smaller mold will receive.\nSince the chocolate is evenly distributed among 27 smaller hemisphere-shaped molds, each smaller mold will receive \\(\\frac{1}{27}\\) of the total volume of chocolate. Therefore, the volume \\(V_{small}\\) each smaller mold will receive is \\(V_{small} = \\frac{V_{large}}{27} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}\\pi}{27} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi \\times \\frac{1}{27} = \\frac{2}{81}\\pi\\) cubic feet.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the radius of each smaller hemisphere-shaped mold.\nThe volume \\(V_{small}\\) of each smaller hemisphere-shaped mold is given by \\(V_{small} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi r_{small}^3\\), where \\(r_{small}\\) is the radius of the smaller mold. We already know that \\(V_{small} = \\frac{2}{81}\\pi\\). Setting these equal gives \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r_{small}^3 = \\frac{2}{81}\\pi\\). Solving for \\(r_{small}\\) involves dividing both sides by \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\) to get \\(r_{small}^3 = \\frac{\\frac{2}{81}\\pi}{\\frac{2}{3}\\pi} = \\frac{2}{81} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{1}{27}\\). Taking the cube root of both sides to solve for \\(r_{small}\\) yields \\(r_{small} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$"
