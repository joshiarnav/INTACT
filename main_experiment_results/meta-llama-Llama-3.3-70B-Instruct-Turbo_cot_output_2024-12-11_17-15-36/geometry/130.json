    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the given angles in the triangle $PQR$\nWe are given that $\\angle PQR = 63^\\circ$ and $\\angle QPR = 59^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the third angle of the triangle $PQR$\nThe sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, so we can find $\\angle QRP$ as $180^\\circ - \\angle PQR - \\angle QPR = 180^\\circ - 63^\\circ - 59^\\circ = 58^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 3: Understand the relationship between the incenter $C$ and the angles of the triangle\nThe incenter $C$ of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors intersect. Since $C$ is the incenter, it is equidistant from all sides of the triangle, and the line segments from $C$ to the vertices of the triangle bisect the angles.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the angle bisected by $RC$\nSince $RC$ is a line segment from the incenter to vertex $R$, it bisects $\\angle QRP$. This means $\\angle QRC = \\frac{1}{2} \\angle QRP$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $\\angle QRC$\nUsing the value of $\\angle QRP$ calculated in step 2, we find $\\angle QRC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 58^\\circ = 29^\\circ$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{29}$"
