    "solution": "Drawing a diagram and adding $OM$ perpendicular to $AD$, we get\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-1,1);\nB=(1,1);\nC=(1,-1);\nD=(-1,-1);\nE=(-1,-.577);\nF=(-1,.577);\nM=(-1,0);\ndraw(circle(O,1.155));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--A);\ndraw(F--O);\ndraw(O--E);\ndraw(O--M);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"F\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, dir(0));\nlabel(\"M\", M, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (F+O)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (E+O)/2, SE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", M, W);\n[/asy] First note that $O$ is not only the center of the circle but also the center of the square since the diagram is symmetric. Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Draw and visualize the problem\nTo solve this problem, we first need to visualize the situation described. We have a square and a circle that intersect in such a way that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle. Let's denote the radius of the circle as $r$. Drawing this out, we can see that the point where the circle and square intersect forms an equilateral triangle, since the chord of the circle (which is also the side of the square) is equal to the radius of the circle.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the side length of the square\nGiven that the chord of the circle is equal to the radius of the circle, we can determine that the side length of the square is $r\\sqrt{3}$. This is because the equilateral triangle formed has sides equal to $r$, and using the properties of an equilateral triangle, we know that the altitude (which in this case is half the side of the square) is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}r$. Therefore, the full side length of the square is $r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area of the square\nThe area of the square, $A_{square}$, can be found using the formula $A_{square} = s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side of the square. Substituting $r\\sqrt{3}$ for $s$, we get $A_{square} = (r\\sqrt{3})^2 = 3r^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the circle\nThe area of the circle, $A_{circle}$, is given by the formula $A_{circle} = \\pi r^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle\nTo find the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle, we divide the area of the square by the area of the circle: $\\frac{A_{square}}{A_{circle}} = \\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}$. Simplifying this expression gives us $\\frac{3}{\\pi}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$"
