    "problem": "Jimmy owns a cube-shaped container that measures $10$ inches on each side. He fills this container with water until it is half full. Then he throws ten giant ice cubes that measure $2$ inches on each side into the container. In inches cubed, how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water?",
    "solution": "First let's compute the volume of the container. The container measures $10\\times10\\times10$ so its volume is  $$10\\cdot10\\cdot10=10^3=1000$$inches cubed. Since the container is only half full, there are $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10^3=500$$inches cubed of water in it. Additionally, there are ten ice cubes each with a volume of $2^3$. This means that the total volume of the ice cubes is $$10\\cdot2^3=10\\cdot8=80.$$Altogether, the water and the ice cubes occupy $500+80=580$ inches cubed. This means that there are $1000-580=\\boxed{420}$ inches cubed of space in the container unoccupied by water and ice.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the volume of the container\nTo find the volume of the cube-shaped container, we need to calculate the length times the width times the height. Since each side of the container is $10$ inches, the volume of the container is $10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 1000$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the volume of the water in the container\nThe container is filled with water until it is half full. Therefore, the volume of water in the container is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1000 = 500$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the volume of a single giant ice cube\nEach giant ice cube measures $2$ inches on each side, so the volume of one ice cube is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total volume of the ten giant ice cubes\nJimmy throws ten giant ice cubes into the container. The total volume of these ice cubes is $10 \\times 8 = 80$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total volume occupied by water and ice\nThe total volume occupied by water and ice is the sum of the volume of the water and the volume of the ice cubes, which is $500 + 80 = 580$ cubic inches.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the volume of the container that is unoccupied by ice or water\nTo find the volume of the container that is unoccupied by ice or water, we subtract the total volume occupied by water and ice from the volume of the container. Therefore, the unoccupied volume is $1000 - 580 = 420$ cubic inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{420}$"
