    "solution": "Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the dimensions of the box. It is given that \\[140=4a+4b+4c{\\qquad \\rm and\n\\qquad}21=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}\\] hence \\[35=a+b+c{\\qquad (1)\\qquad\n\\rm and\\qquad}441=a^2+b^2+c^2{\\qquad (2)}.\\]\n\nSquare both sides of $(1)$ and combine with $(2)$ to obtain \\begin{align*}\n1225 & = (a+b+c)^2 \\\\\n&= a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2bc+2ca \\\\\n&= 441+2ab+2bc+2ca.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus the surface area of the box is \\[ 2ab+2bc+2ca=1225-441=\\boxed{784}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the dimensions of the rectangular box\nLet's denote the length, width, and height of the rectangular box as $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Express the sum of the lengths of the twelve edges\nThe sum of the lengths of the twelve edges of the rectangular box can be expressed as $4a + 4b + 4c = 140$, which simplifies to $a + b + c = 35$.\n\n## Step 3: Express the distance from one corner to the farthest corner\nThe distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner can be expressed as $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = 21$.\n\n## Step 4: Square the equation from step 3 to remove the square root\nSquaring both sides of the equation $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = 21$ gives $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 441$.\n\n## Step 5: Use the equation from step 2 to find an expression for the sum of the squares of the dimensions\nSquaring the equation $a + b + c = 35$ gives $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 1225$.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute the result from step 4 into the equation from step 5\nSubstituting $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 441$ into $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 1225$ gives $441 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 1225$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the equation from step 6 to find the expression for the surface area\nSimplifying $441 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 1225$ gives $2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 784$, which can be further simplified to $ab + bc + ac = 392$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total surface area of the box\nThe total surface area of the box is given by $2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 2(ab + bc + ac)$.\n\n## Step 9: Substitute the result from step 7 into the equation from step 8\nSubstituting $ab + bc + ac = 392$ into $2(ab + bc + ac)$ gives $2(392) = 784$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{784}$"
