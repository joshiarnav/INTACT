    "problem": "The radius of a cylinder is doubled and its height is tripled. If its original volume was 10 cubic feet, what is its volume now, in cubic feet?",
    "solution": "Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively.  The new cylinder has volume \\[\n\\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\\pi r^2 h,\n\\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume.  Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.",

    "model_solution": "To find the new volume of the cylinder, let's start by understanding the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is given by \\(V = \\pi r^2 h\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius and \\(h\\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\nOriginally, the volume \\(V\\) is 10 cubic feet. Let's denote the original radius and height as \\(r\\) and \\(h\\), respectively. So, we have:\n\\[10 = \\pi r^2 h\\]\n\nNow, the radius is doubled and the height is tripled. This means the new radius \\(r'\\) is \\(2r\\) and the new height \\(h'\\) is \\(3h\\).\n\nWe need to find the new volume \\(V'\\) using the new dimensions:\n\\[V' = \\pi (r')^2 (h')\\]\n\\[V' = \\pi (2r)^2 (3h)\\]\n\\[V' = \\pi 4r^2 3h\\]\n\\[V' = 12 \\pi r^2 h\\]\n\nSince \\(\\pi r^2 h = 10\\), we substitute this back into our equation for \\(V'\\):\n\\[V' = 12 \\times 10\\]\n\\[V' = 120\\]\n\nSo, the new volume of the cylinder is 120 cubic feet.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{120}$"
