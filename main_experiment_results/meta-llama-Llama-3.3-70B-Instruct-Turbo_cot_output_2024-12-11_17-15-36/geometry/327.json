Hence, the perimeter of the quadrilateral is \\[\\frac a2 + 2a + \\frac{3a}2 + a\\sqrt{5} = \\left(4+\\sqrt5\\right)a,\\]and when this is divided by $a,$ we get $\\boxed{4+\\sqrt{5}}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the points where the line y = x/2 intersects the sides of the square.\nTo find these points, we need to consider each side of the square and solve for the intersection with the line y = x/2. The sides of the square can be represented by the equations y = -a, y = a, x = -a, and x = a.\n\n## Step 2: Find the intersection points of the line y = x/2 with the sides of the square.\nFirst, intersecting y = x/2 with y = -a gives x/2 = -a, so x = -2a. However, this x value is outside the bounds of the square, so we ignore it. Next, intersecting y = x/2 with y = a gives x/2 = a, so x = 2a, which is also outside the bounds of the square. Then, intersecting y = x/2 with x = -a gives y = -a/2. Lastly, intersecting y = x/2 with x = a gives y = a/2.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the vertices of one of the congruent quadrilaterals.\nThe vertices of one of the quadrilaterals are (-a, -a), (-a, -a/2), (a, a/2), and (a, -a).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral.\nThe length of the side from (-a, -a) to (-a, -a/2) is |-a/2 - (-a)| = |a/2| = a/2. The length of the side from (-a, -a/2) to (a, a/2) can be found using the distance formula: sqrt((a - (-a))^2 + (a/2 - (-a/2))^2) = sqrt((2a)^2 + (a)^2) = sqrt(4a^2 + a^2) = sqrt(5a^2) = asqrt(5). The length of the side from (a, a/2) to (a, -a) is |a/2 - (-a)| = |3a/2| = 3a/2. The length of the side from (a, -a) to (-a, -a) is 2a (since it's one side of the square).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the perimeter of the quadrilateral.\nThe perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all sides: a/2 + asqrt(5) + 3a/2 + 2a.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression for the perimeter.\nCombine like terms: a/2 + 3a/2 + 2a = 6a/2 = 3a. So the perimeter is 3a + asqrt(5).\n\n## Step 7: Divide the perimeter by a to get the final value.\n(3a + asqrt(5))/a = 3 + sqrt(5).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4 + \\sqrt{5}}$"
