The base has side $10$, so the diagonal will satisfy: $$d^2=10^2+10^2=200$$ $$d=10\\sqrt{2}$$ Half of this is $5\\sqrt{2}$.  Now we can look at the right triangle formed by the altitude from the vertex of the pyramid, the line just drawn in, and with hypotenuse as the edge we need to find the length of.  The length of this edge is: $$\\sqrt{12^2+(5\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{144+50}=\\sqrt{194}\\approx 13.928$$ The total length of all edges is: $$4(10)+4(13.928)\\approx \\boxed{ 96}$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the length of the base edges\nThe pyramid has a square base with each side measuring 10 cm. Since there are 4 edges on the base, the total length of these edges is 4 * 10 = 40 cm.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the length of the slant edges\nTo find the length of the slant edges, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem. We can imagine a right triangle where the height of the pyramid (12 cm) is one leg, and the distance from the center of the base to one of its corners is the other leg. The distance from the center of the base to one of its corners can be found using the Pythagorean theorem on the base itself, where the two legs are half the diagonal of the base. The diagonal of the base is $\\sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = \\sqrt{200} = 10\\sqrt{2}$ cm. Half of this diagonal is $5\\sqrt{2}$ cm.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of a slant edge\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, the length of a slant edge is $\\sqrt{(12)^2 + (5\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 50} = \\sqrt{194} \\approx 13.9284$ cm.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total length of the slant edges\nThere are 4 slant edges, so the total length of these edges is $4 * 13.9284 \\approx 55.7136$ cm.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the sum of the lengths of all edges\nThe sum of the lengths of all edges is the sum of the lengths of the base edges and the slant edges, which is $40 + 55.7136 \\approx 95.7136$ cm.\n\n## Step 6: Round the sum to the nearest whole number\nRounding the sum to the nearest whole number gives us 96 cm.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{96}$"
