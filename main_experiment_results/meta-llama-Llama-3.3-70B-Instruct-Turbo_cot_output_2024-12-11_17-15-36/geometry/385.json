    "problem": "What is the volume in cubic inches of a right, rectangular prism with side, front and bottom faces having an area 15 square inches, 10 square inches and 6 square inches, respectively?",
    "solution": "Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the dimensions of the rectangular prism\nLet's denote the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism as $l$, $w$, and $h$, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Set up equations based on the given areas\nThe area of the side face is given by $l \\times h = 15$ square inches, the area of the front face is $w \\times h = 10$ square inches, and the area of the bottom face is $l \\times w = 6$ square inches.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the system of equations to find the dimensions\nFrom $l \\times w = 6$, we can express $l$ in terms of $w$ as $l = \\frac{6}{w}$.\nFrom $w \\times h = 10$, we can express $h$ in terms of $w$ as $h = \\frac{10}{w}$.\nSubstituting $l = \\frac{6}{w}$ and $h = \\frac{10}{w}$ into $l \\times h = 15$, we get $\\frac{6}{w} \\times \\frac{10}{w} = 15$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $w$\nThe equation $\\frac{6}{w} \\times \\frac{10}{w} = 15$ simplifies to $\\frac{60}{w^2} = 15$.\nMultiplying both sides by $w^2$ gives $60 = 15w^2$.\nDividing both sides by 15 gives $4 = w^2$.\nTaking the square root of both sides gives $w = 2$ (since $w$ must be positive).\n\n## Step 5: Find $l$ and $h$ using $w$\nSubstituting $w = 2$ into $l \\times w = 6$ gives $l \\times 2 = 6$, so $l = 3$.\nSubstituting $w = 2$ into $w \\times h = 10$ gives $2 \\times h = 10$, so $h = 5$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the volume of the rectangular prism\nThe volume $V$ of a rectangular prism is given by $V = l \\times w \\times h$.\nSubstituting $l = 3$, $w = 2$, and $h = 5$ into the volume formula gives $V = 3 \\times 2 \\times 5 = 30$ cubic inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$"
