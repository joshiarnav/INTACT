    "solution": "We first draw a diagram: [asy]\npair A, B, C, E, F;\nA = (0, 4);\nB = (-3, 0);\nC = (7, 0);\nE = 0.5 * A + 0.5 * C;\nF = 0.5 * A + 0.5 * B;\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--E--F--cycle);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\n[/asy] Since $F$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, the area of $\\triangle AFC$ is half of the area of $\\triangle ABC,$ or 12 square units. Following the same reasoning, we see that $E$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AC},$ so the area of $\\triangle CEF$ is half that of $\\triangle AFC,$ or $\\boxed{6}$ square units.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given information\nWe are given a triangle $ABC$, with $E$ and $F$ as the midpoints of sides $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{AB}$, respectively. The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is given as 24 square units.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the property of midsegments in triangles\nIn any triangle, the segment joining the midpoints of two sides is called a midsegment. A midsegment is always parallel to the third side and is half as long as the third side. Additionally, the area of the triangle formed by the midsegment and the third side is one-fourth the area of the original triangle.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the property to find the area of $\\triangle CEF$\nSince $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{AB}$, respectively, $\\overline{EF}$ is a midsegment of $\\triangle ABC$. Therefore, the area of $\\triangle CEF$ is one-fourth the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of $\\triangle CEF$\nGiven that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is 24 square units, we can calculate the area of $\\triangle CEF$ as $\\frac{1}{4} \\times 24 = 6$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
