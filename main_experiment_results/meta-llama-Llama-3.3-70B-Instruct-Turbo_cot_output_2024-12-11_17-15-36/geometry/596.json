    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nThe problem describes an equilateral triangle ABC with a point P inside it. Perpendiculars are drawn from point P to the sides of the triangle, and the lengths of these perpendiculars are given as PQ = 1, PR = 2, and PS = 3.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the properties of an equilateral triangle\nAn equilateral triangle has all sides equal in length and all angles equal to 60 degrees. The area of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using the formula: Area = (sqrt(3) / 4) * side^2.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area of the equilateral triangle\nThe area of the equilateral triangle ABC can also be calculated by summing the areas of the three smaller triangles APB, BPC, and CPA. Since the perpendiculars from point P to the sides of the triangle are given, we can use the formula: Area = (base * height) / 2 for each smaller triangle.\n\n## Step 4: Express the area of the equilateral triangle in terms of its side length\nLet's denote the side length of the equilateral triangle as 's'. The area of triangle APB is (s * 1) / 2, the area of triangle BPC is (s * 2) / 2, and the area of triangle CPA is (s * 3) / 2. The sum of these areas is equal to the area of the equilateral triangle: (s * 1) / 2 + (s * 2) / 2 + (s * 3) / 2 = (sqrt(3) / 4) * s^2.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the equation\nCombine like terms: (1 + 2 + 3) * s / 2 = (sqrt(3) / 4) * s^2. This simplifies to (6 * s) / 2 = (sqrt(3) / 4) * s^2.\n\n## Step 6: Further simplify the equation\nSimplify the left side: 3s = (sqrt(3) / 4) * s^2.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for 's'\nDivide both sides by 's' to get: 3 = (sqrt(3) / 4) * s. Now, multiply both sides by 4 / sqrt(3) to solve for 's': s = 3 * (4 / sqrt(3)).\n\n## Step 8: Rationalize the denominator\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by sqrt(3): s = 3 * (4 / sqrt(3)) * (sqrt(3) / sqrt(3)) = 3 * (4 * sqrt(3)) / 3 = 4 * sqrt(3).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$"
