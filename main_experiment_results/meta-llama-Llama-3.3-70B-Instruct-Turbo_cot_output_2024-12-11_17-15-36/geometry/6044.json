By the Two Tangent Theorem, $AP = AQ = 23$, $BP = BR = 27$, and $CQ = CR = x$. Using $rs = A$, where $s = \\frac{27 \\cdot 2 + 23 \\cdot 2 + x \\cdot 2}{2} = 50 + x$, we get $(21)(50 + x) = A$. By Heron's formula, $A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{(50+x)(x)(23)(27)}$. Equating and squaring both sides,\n\\begin{eqnarray*}  [21(50+x)]^2 &=& (50+x)(x)(621)\\\\ 441(50+x) &=& 621x\\\\ 180x = 441 \\cdot 50 &\\Longrightarrow & x = \\frac{245}{2}   \\end{eqnarray*}\nWe want the perimeter, which is $2s = 2\\left(50 + \\frac{245}{2}\\right) = \\boxed{345}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the properties of the inscribed circle of a triangle\nThe inscribed circle of a triangle is the circle that is tangent to all three sides of the triangle. The point where the inscribed circle is tangent to a side of the triangle is called the point of tangency. In this problem, we are given that the inscribed circle is tangent to $\\overline{AB}$ at $P$.\n\n## Step 2: Use the given information to find the length of side AB\nWe are given that $AP = 23$ and $PB = 27$. The length of side $AB$ is the sum of $AP$ and $PB$, so $AB = AP + PB = 23 + 27 = 50$.\n\n## Step 3: Recall the relationship between the radius of the inscribed circle and the sides of the triangle\nThe radius $r$ of the inscribed circle is related to the area $K$ and semiperimeter $s$ of the triangle by the formula $K = rs$, where $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$ and $a$, $b$, $c$ are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n\n## Step 4: Use the properties of tangents to the inscribed circle to find the lengths of the other sides\nSince the inscribed circle is tangent to all three sides of the triangle, we can use the fact that the tangents from a point outside the circle to the circle are equal in length. Let's denote $AQ = x$ and $QC = y$, where $Q$ is the point of tangency of the inscribed circle with side $AC$. Similarly, let's denote $BR = z$ and $RC = w$, where $R$ is the point of tangency of the inscribed circle with side $BC$. Then, we have $x + y = AC$, $z + w = BC$, and $x + z = AB = 50$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the equal tangents theorem\nBy the equal tangents theorem, we have $x = AP = 23$, $z = PB = 27$, $y = w$, and $x + z = 50$. Since $x = 23$ and $z = 27$, we can find $y$ and $w$ using the fact that $y = w$ and $x + y = AC$, $z + w = BC$. However, to find the perimeter, we need to consider the relationship between the radius of the inscribed circle and the sides of the triangle.\n\n## Step 6: Use the formula for the area of a triangle and the relationship between the radius of the inscribed circle and the semiperimeter\nWe know that the area of the triangle $K = rs$, where $r$ is the radius of the inscribed circle and $s$ is the semiperimeter of the triangle. However, without the height or more information about the triangle, we cannot directly calculate the area or the semiperimeter.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the relationship between the inradius, the semiperimeter, and the tangents\nGiven that $r = 21$, and knowing that $r = \\frac{K}{s}$, where $K$ is the area of the triangle and $s$ is the semiperimeter, we still need a direct way to calculate the perimeter using the given information.\n\n## Step 8: Use the fact that the tangents from a vertex to the inscribed circle are equal to the semiperimeter minus the opposite side\nLet's denote $a = BC$, $b = AC$, and $c = AB$. We know that $c = 50$. The formula for the perimeter is $P = a + b + c$. Since $r = 21$, and knowing that the tangents from each vertex to the inscribed circle are equal to the semiperimeter minus the length of the opposite side, we can use the given tangents $AP = 23$ and $PB = 27$ to find $a$ and $b$.\n\n## Step 9: Apply the formula for the perimeter using the given radius and tangents\nSince $AP = 23$, $PB = 27$, and $AB = 50$, we can deduce that $AQ = 23$ and $BR = 27$ are the lengths of the tangents from $A$ and $B$ to the points of tangency on $AC$ and $BC$, respectively. Given that $r = 21$, we know that $s - a = 23$, $s - b = 27$, and $s - c = 21$ (since $c = 50$ and $r = 21$).\n\n## Step 10: Solve the equations to find the perimeter\nWe have $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$. Since $c = 50$, we can write $s - a = 23$, $s - b = 27$, and $s - 50 = 21$. Simplifying the last equation gives $s = 71$. Now, we can find $a$ and $b$ using $s - a = 23$ and $s - b = 27$. So, $71 - a = 23$ and $71 - b = 27$, which give $a = 48$ and $b = 44$.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the perimeter\nThe perimeter $P = a + b + c = 48 + 44 + 50 = 142$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{142}$"
