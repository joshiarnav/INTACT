    "solution": "Let the smaller angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$ be $\\theta$. Note that the centers of the two circles lie on the angle bisector of the angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$. Also note that if $(x,y)$ is on said angle bisector, we have that $\\frac{y}{x}=\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}$. Let $\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=m_1$, for convenience. Therefore if $(x,y)$ is on the angle bisector, then $x=\\frac{y}{m_1}$. Now let the centers of the two relevant circles be $(a/m_1 , a)$ and $(b/m_1 , b)$ for some positive reals $a$ and $b$. These two circles are tangent to the $x$-axis, so the radii of the circles are $a$ and $b$ respectively. We know that the point $(9,6)$ is a point on both circles, so we have that\n\\[(9-\\frac{a}{m_1})^2+(6-a)^2=a^2\\]\n\\[(9-\\frac{b}{m_1})^2+(6-b)^2=b^2\\]\nExpanding these and manipulating terms gives\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}a^2-[(18/m_1)+12]a+117=0\\]\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}b^2-[(18/m_1)+12]b+117=0\\]\nIt follows that $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the quadratic\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}x^2-[(18/m_1)+12]x+117=0\\]\nIt follows from Vieta's Formulas that the product of the roots of this quadratic is $117m_1^2$, but we were also given that the product of the radii was 68. Therefore $68=117m_1^2$, or $m_1^2=\\frac{68}{117}$. Note that the half-angle formula for tangents is\n\\[\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\cos{\\theta}}{1+\\cos{\\theta}}}\\]\nTherefore\n\\[\\frac{68}{117}=\\frac{1-\\cos{\\theta}}{1+\\cos{\\theta}}\\]\nSolving for $\\cos{\\theta}$ gives that $\\cos{\\theta}=\\frac{49}{185}$. It then follows that $\\sin{\\theta}=\\sqrt{1-\\cos^2{\\theta}}=\\frac{12\\sqrt{221}}{185}$.\nIt then follows that $m=\\tan{\\theta}=\\frac{12\\sqrt{221}}{49}$. Therefore $a=12$, $b=221$, and $c=49$. The desired answer is then $12+221+49=\\boxed{282}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the problem\nWe are given two circles, $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$, that intersect at two points, one of which is $(9,6)$. The product of the radii of these circles is $68$. Additionally, the x-axis and the line $y = mx$ (where $m > 0$) are tangent to both circles. We need to find the value of $m$ in the form $a\\sqrt {b}/c$ and then calculate $a + b + c$.\n\n## Step 2: Setting up the equation for the circles\nLet's consider the circle $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ with center $(a/m_1 , a)$ and radius $r_1$ and the circle $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ with center $(b/m_1 , b)$ and radius $r_2$. The point $(9,6)$ lies on both circles, and the x-axis and the line $y = mx$ are tangent to both circles.\n\n## Step 3: Using the given point to establish relationships between the circles\nUsing the point $(9,6)$, we can establish the following relationships:\n$(9 - a/m_1)^2 + (6 - a)^2 = r_1^2$ and $(9 - b/m_1)^2 + (6 - b)^2 = r_2^2$.\nAlso, the product of the radii is given as $r_1r_2 = 68$.\n\n## Step 4: Finding the relationship between the centers and the radii of the circles\nSince the x-axis is tangent to both circles, we have $r_1 = a$ and $r_2 = b$.\nUsing the fact that the line $y = mx$ is tangent to both circles, we can derive the relationship $m_1 = m$.\n\n## Step 5: Applying the angle bisector theorem\nThe angle bisector theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments of the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the two sides of the triangle. Applying this theorem to the triangle formed by the centers of the circles and the point of intersection, we can derive the relationship $m = \\frac{a}{9 - \\frac{a}{m}} = \\frac{b}{9 - \\frac{b}{m}}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplifying the relationship between a and b\nSolving for $a$ and $b$ in terms of $m$, we can simplify the relationship between $a$ and $b$ to $a = \\frac{9m}{m+1}$ and $b = \\frac{9m}{m-1}$.\n\n## Step 7: Using the product of the radii to find m\nWe know that $r_1r_2 = ab = 68$. Substituting the expressions for $a$ and $b$, we get $\\frac{81m^2}{m^2 - 1} = 68$.\n\n## Step 8: Solving for m\nSolving for $m$ in the equation $\\frac{81m^2}{m^2 - 1} = 68$, we can simplify to $81m^2 = 68m^2 - 68$ and further to $13m^2 = 68$.\n\n## Step 9: Finding the value of m\nFinally, solving for $m$, we get $m^2 = \\frac{68}{13}$, which gives $m = \\frac{\\sqrt{68}}{\\sqrt{13}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{17}}{\\sqrt{13}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{17}\\sqrt{13}}{\\sqrt{13}\\sqrt{13}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{221}}{13}$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculating a + b + c\nNow that we have $m = \\frac{2\\sqrt{221}}{13}$, we can calculate $a + b + c$ as $2 + 221 + 13$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{236}$"
