    "problem": "Square $ABCD$ has sides of length 2. Set $S$ is the set of all line segments that have length 2 and whose endpoints are on adjacent sides of the square. The midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ enclose a region whose area to the nearest hundredth is $k$. Find $100k$.\n",
    "solution": "Without loss of generality, let $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, $(0,2)$, and $(2,2)$ be the vertices of the square. Suppose the endpoints of the segment lie on the two sides of the square determined by the vertex $(0,0)$. Let the two endpoints of the segment have coordinates $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$. Because the segment has length 2, $x^2+y^2=4$. Using the midpoint formula, we find that the midpoint of the segment has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Let $d$ be the distance from $(0,0)$ to $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Using the distance formula we see that $d=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2}= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}\\left(x^2+y^2\\right)}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}(4)}=1$. Thus the midpoints lying on the sides determined by vertex $(0,0)$ form a quarter-circle with radius 1.\n[asy] size(100); pointpen=black;pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); pair A=(0,0),B=(2,0),C=(2,2),D=(0,2); D(A--B--C--D--A);  picture p; draw(p,CR(A,1));draw(p,CR(B,1));draw(p,CR(C,1));draw(p,CR(D,1)); clip(p,A--B--C--D--cycle); add(p); [/asy]\nThe set of all midpoints forms a quarter circle at each corner of the square.

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the geometry of the problem\nThe problem describes a square $ABCD$ with sides of length 2 and line segments of length 2 with endpoints on adjacent sides of the square. We need to visualize and understand the geometry of the situation to proceed.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the midpoint formation\nThe midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ form a quarter circle at each corner of the square $ABCD$. This is because the line segments with endpoints on adjacent sides of the square can be thought of as the radii of a circle with radius 1, given that the line segments themselves have a length of 2.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area enclosed by the midpoints\nThe total area enclosed by the midpoints is the area of the square minus the areas of the four quarter circles. The area of the square is $2^2 = 4$. The area of one quarter circle is $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi(1)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, so the area of four quarter circles is $4 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\pi$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the enclosed area\nThe enclosed area is $4 - \\pi$. To find the area to the nearest hundredth, we calculate $4 - \\pi \\approx 4 - 3.14159 \\approx 0.85841$.\n\n## Step 5: Find $100k$\nThe problem asks for $100k$ where $k$ is the area to the nearest hundredth. Thus, $100k = 100 \\times 0.85841 \\approx 85.841$.\n\n## Step 6: Round to the nearest integer as required for the final answer\nRounding $85.841$ to the nearest integer is not directly requested, but since the format requires a boxed answer and the problem involves calculation to the nearest hundredth, it's implied that we should provide the calculated value as is or rounded appropriately for the final step. However, following the format strictly means we focus on the numerical value resulting from our calculations.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{86}$"
