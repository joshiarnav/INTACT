    "problem": "A right circular cone has base radius $r$ and height $h$. The cone lies on its side on a flat table. As the cone rolls on the surface of the table without slipping, the point where the cone's base meets the table traces a circular arc centered at the point where the vertex touches the table. The cone first returns to its original position on the table after making $17$ complete rotations. The value of $h/r$ can be written in the form $m\\sqrt {n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n$.\n",
    "solution": "The path is a circle with radius equal to the slant height of the cone, which is $\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}}$. Thus, the length of the path is $2\\pi\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}}$.\nAlso, the length of the path is 17 times the circumference of the base, which is $34r\\pi$. Setting these equal gives $\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}} = 17r$, or $h^{2} = 288r^{2}$. Thus, $\\dfrac{h^{2}}{r^{2}} = 288$, and $\\dfrac{h}{r} = 12\\sqrt {2}$, giving an answer of $12 + 2 = \\boxed{14}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the path traced by the cone's base as it rolls on the table.\nThe cone's base traces a circular path as it rolls on the table. This path is essentially a circle with a radius equal to the slant height of the cone, given by $\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$, where $r$ is the radius of the cone's base and $h$ is the height of the cone.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the circumference of the circular path traced by the cone's base.\nThe circumference of the circular path is $2\\pi\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$, as it is a circle with radius $\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the circumference of the cone's base.\nThe circumference of the cone's base is $2\\pi r$, which is the standard formula for the circumference of a circle.\n\n## Step 4: Understand the relationship between the number of rotations and the circumferences.\nAs the cone rolls and makes $17$ complete rotations, the distance traced out by the point on the base is equal to $17$ times the circumference of the base, which must be equal to the circumference of the circular path traced on the table.\n\n## Step 5: Set up the equation based on the relationship between the circumferences.\nSetting the distance traced by the base equal to the circumference of the circular path gives us $17(2\\pi r) = 2\\pi\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the equation to solve for $h/r$.\nSimplifying the equation from Step 5, we get $17r = \\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root yields $289r^2 = r^2 + h^2$. Subtracting $r^2$ from both sides gives us $288r^2 = h^2$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find $h = 12\\sqrt{2}r$. Therefore, $h/r = 12\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the sum of $m$ and $n$.\nGiven $h/r = 12\\sqrt{2}$, we have $m = 12$ and $n = 2$. Thus, $m + n = 12 + 2 = 14$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$"
