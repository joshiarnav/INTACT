    "problem": "A triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units. The length of the third side is $x$ units, where $x$ is an integer. What is the largest possible perimeter of the triangle?",
    "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the triangle inequality theorem\nThe triangle inequality theorem states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. This gives us three inequalities for the sides of length 5, 6, and x: 5 + 6 > x, 5 + x > 6, and 6 + x > 5.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the triangle inequality to find the range of x\nFrom the first inequality, we have 11 > x, which means x < 11. From the second inequality, we get x > 1. The third inequality gives us x > -1, but since x has to be greater than 1 according to the second inequality, we can disregard this. So, x must be an integer greater than 1 and less than 11.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the largest possible integer value for x within the given constraints\nGiven that x is an integer and must be less than 11 and greater than 1, the largest possible integer value for x is 10.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the largest possible perimeter of the triangle\nThe perimeter of the triangle is the sum of all its sides. With sides of length 5 and 6, and the third side being 10, the perimeter would be 5 + 6 + 10 = 21.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$"
