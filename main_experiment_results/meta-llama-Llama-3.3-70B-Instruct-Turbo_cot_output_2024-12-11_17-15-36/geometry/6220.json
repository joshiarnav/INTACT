    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Simplify the problem by positioning point C at (0,0) and point D on the y-axis at (0,1) for easier calculations.\nPositioning point C at (0,0) and point D on the y-axis at (0,1) simplifies the calculations without loss of generality.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the positions of points A and B based on the given conditions and the positioning of C and D.\nGiven that $\\overline{CD} \\bot \\overline{AB}$ and that D is at (0,1), $\\overline{AB}$ must be on the x-axis. Since $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{CB}$ are diameters of semicircles and are tangent to each other and $\\overline{AB}$, and considering the radius of the circle with $\\overline{CD}$ as radius is 1, we can determine the positions of A and B.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the radius of the semicircles constructed on $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{CB}$ to find their areas.\nLet's denote the radius of the larger semicircle as $r_1$ and the smaller one as $r_2$. Given that $\\overline{CD}$ is the radius of the circle with area used for comparison, $r_2 = 1$ because $\\overline{CD}$ is tangent to the smaller semicircle and its length is equal to the radius of the smaller semicircle. Since the semicircles are mutually tangent, $r_1 + r_2 = 4$ (as the diameter of the larger semicircle is 4 units because it spans from point A to point B, and the diameter of the smaller semicircle plus the diameter of the larger semicircle equals the length of $\\overline{AB}$, which is 4 units in this setup). Therefore, $r_1 = 3$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the shaded region by subtracting the areas of the two semicircles from the area of the large semicircle.\nThe area of the shaded region can be found by calculating the area of the large semicircle and subtracting the areas of the two smaller semicircles. The area of a semicircle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi r^2$. Thus, the area of the large semicircle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi (4)^2 = 8\\pi$, the area of the semicircle with radius $r_1 = 3$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi (3)^2 = \\frac{9}{2}\\pi$, and the area of the semicircle with radius $r_2 = 1$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi (1)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi$. The shaded area is $8\\pi - \\frac{9}{2}\\pi - \\frac{1}{2}\\pi = 8\\pi - 5\\pi = 3\\pi$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the area of the circle with $\\overline{CD}$ as radius.\nThe area of a circle with radius $r$ is $\\pi r^2$. Since the radius of the circle with $\\overline{CD}$ as radius is 1, the area of this circle is $\\pi (1)^2 = \\pi$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the ratio of the shaded area to the area of the circle with $\\overline{CD}$ as radius.\nThe ratio of the shaded area to the area of the circle with $\\overline{CD}$ as radius is $\\frac{3\\pi}{\\pi} = 3$.\n\n## Step 7: Express the ratio in the format given by the answer choices.\nThe ratio of the shaded area to the area of the circle with $\\overline{CD}$ as radius is $3:1$ or, in the format of the answer choices, $1: \\frac{1}{3}$, but to match the given options, we interpret it as the shaded area being $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the total area of the comparison circle's area plus the shaded area, thus $1:3$ in the context of comparing the shaded area directly to the area of the circle with $\\overline{CD}$ as radius.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1:3}$"
