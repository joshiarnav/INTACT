    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the given information\nWe have a rectangle $ABCD$ where $AB=12$ units, $AZ=WC=6$ units, and the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is 120 square units.\n\n## Step 2: Find the length of $CD$\nSince $ABCD$ is a rectangle, $CD$ is equal to $AB$, which is 12 units.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the height of the rectangle\nTo find the height of the rectangle, we can use the fact that $AZ=WC=6$ units. This means that the height of the rectangle $ABCD$ is $AZ + ZD = 6 + ZD$. Since $ZWCD$ is a trapezoid, we need to find the height of the trapezoid to calculate its area.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the trapezoid $ZWCD$\nThe area of a trapezoid is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases and $h$ is the height. In this case, $b_1 = CD = 12$ units and $b_2 = ZW = 12 - 6 - 6 = 0$ units (since $ZW$ is not a base of the trapezoid, but $ZW$ is equal to $AZ + WC$, which is equal to $6 + 6 = 12$ units, $ZD$ can be calculated by using the area of the trapezoid). However, to find the height of the trapezoid, we need to find $ZD$. Let's denote the height of the rectangle as $h$. The area of the trapezoid can be expressed as $\\frac{1}{2}(12 + (12-6-6))(h-6) = 120$. We can simplify this equation to find $h$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the equation to find $h$\nSince $AZ=WC=6$ units, $ZD = h - 6$. The area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ can be expressed as $\\frac{1}{2}(12 + 0)(h-6) = 120$ or $6(h-6) = 120$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $h$\n$6(h-6) = 120$ can be simplified to $h-6 = 20$. Solving for $h$, we get $h = 20 + 6 = 26$ units.\n\n## Step 7: Find the area of triangle $BQW$\nSince $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$, the area of triangle $BQW$ is half the area of triangle $ZWB$. The area of triangle $ZWB$ can be calculated using the formula $\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height. The base of triangle $ZWB$ is $ZW = 12 - 6 - 6 = 0$ units (since $ZW$ is equal to $AZ + WC$, which is equal to $6 + 6 = 12$ units) and the height of triangle $ZWB$ is $WB = 6$ units (since $WB = WC = 6$ units) and $AB = 12$ units (since $AB$ is given). However, the height of triangle $ZWB$ should be $BZ$ or $ZW$. Let's use $BZ$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the area of triangle $BQW$\nTo find the area of triangle $BQW$, we first need to find the length of $BZ$ or $ZW$. However, since we are looking for the area of triangle $BQW$ and $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$, we can use the fact that the area of triangle $BQW$ is half the area of triangle $BZW$. Since $BZ = 20$ units (calculated from $h$) and $ZW = 8$ units (since $AZ + ZW + WB = AB$ and $AZ + WB = 12$ units), we can calculate the area of triangle $BZW$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the area of triangle $BZW$\nThe area of triangle $BZW$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 \\cdot 12 = 48$ square units (since $BZ$ is not the height of triangle $BZW$, we should use $ZW$ as the base and $BZ$ or $12$ as the height).\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the area of triangle $BQW$\nSince the area of triangle $BQW$ is half the area of triangle $BZW$, the area of triangle $BQW$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 48 = 24$ square units (since $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$"
