    "problem": "A round pizza is $\\frac13$ of an inch thick and has a diameter of 12 inches. It is cut into 12 congruent pieces. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one piece? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "The entire pizza has radius 6 inches and volume $\\pi (6^2)(1/3) = 12\\pi$ cubic inches.  One slice has 1/12th this volume, or $\\boxed{\\pi}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the formula for the volume of a cylinder\nThe volume \\(V\\) of a cylinder is given by the formula \\(V = \\pi r^2 h\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the cylinder's base and \\(h\\) is the height (or thickness) of the cylinder.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the radius of the pizza\nGiven that the diameter of the pizza is 12 inches, the radius \\(r\\) is half of the diameter, so \\(r = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\\) inches.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the volume of the whole pizza\nUsing the volume formula for a cylinder and given that the pizza is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of an inch thick, we substitute \\(r = 6\\) inches and \\(h = \\frac{1}{3}\\) inch into the volume formula: \\(V = \\pi (6)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\).\n\n## Step 4: Perform the calculation for the volume of the whole pizza\n\\(V = \\pi (36) \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 12\\pi\\) cubic inches.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the volume of one piece of the pizza\nSince the pizza is cut into 12 congruent pieces, the volume of one piece is \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) of the total volume of the pizza. Therefore, the volume of one piece is \\(\\frac{12\\pi}{12} = \\pi\\) cubic inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\pi}$"
