    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the unit circle definition of cosine\nThe cosine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. However, for angles greater than 90 degrees, we use the unit circle to define cosine. The point on the unit circle corresponding to the angle gives the cosine as its x-coordinate.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the angle to a corresponding angle in the unit circle\nThe angle 240 degrees is in the third quadrant of the unit circle. To find its corresponding angle in the first quadrant, we subtract 180 degrees, which gives us 60 degrees. This means the cosine of 240 degrees will have the same absolute value as the cosine of 60 degrees but will be negative because it falls in the third quadrant.\n\n## Step 3: Recall the cosine of 60 degrees\nThe cosine of 60 degrees is known to be 1/2 or 0.5. Since the angle 240 degrees is in the third quadrant, where cosine values are negative, the cosine of 240 degrees will be -1/2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-0.5}$"
