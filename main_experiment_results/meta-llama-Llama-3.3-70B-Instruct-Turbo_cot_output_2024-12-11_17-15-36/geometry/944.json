    "problem": "In trapezoid $ABCD$, the parallel sides $AB$ and $CD$ have lengths of 8 and 20 units, respectively, and the altitude is 12 units. Points $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of sides $AD$ and $BC$, respectively. What is the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ in square units?",
    "solution": "Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, quadrilateral $EFCD$ is a trapezoid with half the altitude of the original trapezoid (the altitude of trapezoid $EFCD$ is $12/2 = 6$). The length of base $CD$ is still $20$, but now we have to find the length of base $EF$. Since $EF$ connects the midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, its length is also the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$. Thus, $EF$ has length $\\frac{8+20}{2} = 14$. Finally, we can find the area of the trapezoid with the formula $\\text{Area} = a \\left(\\frac{b_1+b_2}{2}\\right)$ where $a$ is the altitude and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases. The area of trapezoid $EFCD $ is $6 \\left(\\frac{14+20}{2}\\right)=6 \\cdot 17 = \\boxed{102}$ square units.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the given information\nWe are given a trapezoid $ABCD$ with parallel sides $AB = 8$ units and $CD = 20$ units, and the altitude of the trapezoid is 12 units. Points $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of sides $AD$ and $BC$, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the properties of midpoints in a trapezoid\nThe midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid, when connected, form a line that is parallel to the bases of the trapezoid and is equal in length to the average of the lengths of the bases.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the length of $EF$\nSince $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, the length of $EF$ is the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$. Thus, $EF = \\frac{AB + CD}{2} = \\frac{8 + 20}{2} = 14$ units.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the altitude of quadrilateral $EFCD$\nBecause $EF$ is parallel to $AB$ and $CD$, the altitude of quadrilateral $EFCD$ is half the altitude of the original trapezoid $ABCD$. Therefore, the altitude of $EFCD$ is $\\frac{12}{2} = 6$ units.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$\nThe area of a trapezoid can be calculated using the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (a + b) \\times h$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the parallel sides and $h$ is the altitude. For quadrilateral $EFCD$, $a = EF = 14$ units, $b = CD = 20$ units, and $h = 6$ units. Thus, the area of $EFCD$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (14 + 20) \\times 6 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 34 \\times 6 = 102$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{102}$"
