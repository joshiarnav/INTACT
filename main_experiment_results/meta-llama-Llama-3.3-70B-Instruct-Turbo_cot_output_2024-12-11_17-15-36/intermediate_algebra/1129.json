    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Divide the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor\nTo start the division, we divide the leading term of the dividend, $8x^3$, by the leading term of the divisor, $2x$. This gives us $8x^3 / 2x = 4x^2$.\n\n## Step 2: Multiply the entire divisor by the quotient from step 1\nNow, we multiply the entire divisor, $2x+5$, by the quotient from step 1, $4x^2$. This gives us $4x^2(2x+5) = 8x^3 + 20x^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Subtract the product from step 2 from the dividend\nWe subtract the product from step 2, $8x^3 + 20x^2$, from the original dividend, $8x^3+16x^2-7x+4$. This gives us $(8x^3+16x^2-7x+4) - (8x^3 + 20x^2) = -4x^2 - 7x + 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Bring down the next term and repeat the process\nNow, we bring down the next term, which is $-7x + 4$, and repeat the process. We divide the leading term of the new dividend, $-4x^2$, by the leading term of the divisor, $2x$. This gives us $-4x^2 / 2x = -2x$.\n\n## Step 5: Multiply the entire divisor by the quotient from step 4\nWe multiply the entire divisor, $2x+5$, by the quotient from step 4, $-2x$. This gives us $-2x(2x+5) = -4x^2 - 10x$.\n\n## Step 6: Subtract the product from step 5 from the new dividend\nWe subtract the product from step 5, $-4x^2 - 10x$, from the new dividend, $-4x^2 - 7x + 4$. This gives us $(-4x^2 - 7x + 4) - (-4x^2 - 10x) = 3x + 4$.\n\n## Step 7: Bring down the next term and repeat the process\nNow, we bring down the next term, which is $+4$, and repeat the process. We divide the leading term of the new dividend, $3x$, by the leading term of the divisor, $2x$. This gives us $3x / 2x = 1.5$.\n\n## Step 8: Multiply the entire divisor by the quotient from step 7\nWe multiply the entire divisor, $2x+5$, by the quotient from step 7, $1.5$. This gives us $1.5(2x+5) = 3x + 7.5$.\n\n## Step 9: Subtract the product from step 8 from the new dividend\nWe subtract the product from step 8, $3x + 7.5$, from the new dividend, $3x + 4$. This gives us $(3x + 4) - (3x + 7.5) = -3.5$.\n\n## Step 10: Write the final quotient\nThe final quotient is $4x^2 - 2x + 1.5$ with a remainder of $-3.5$. However, since the problem asks for the quotient, we will ignore the remainder.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4x^2 - 2x + 1.5}$"
