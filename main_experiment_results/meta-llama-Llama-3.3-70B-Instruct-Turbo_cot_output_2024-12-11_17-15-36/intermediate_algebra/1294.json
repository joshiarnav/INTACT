    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the definition of the modulus of a complex number\nThe modulus $|z|$ of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is given by $|z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the given information\nWe are given that $|a| = 2$ and $|b| = \\sqrt{26}$, and we need to find $t$ such that $ab = t - 2i$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the property of the modulus of a product\nThe modulus of the product of two complex numbers is the product of their moduli. Hence, $|ab| = |a||b|$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $|ab|$\nGiven $|a| = 2$ and $|b| = \\sqrt{26}$, we find $|ab| = 2 \\times \\sqrt{26} = 2\\sqrt{26}$.\n\n## Step 5: Express $ab$ in terms of $t$\nWe have $ab = t - 2i$. The modulus of $ab$ is $|ab| = \\sqrt{t^2 + 4}$, because $ab$ is a complex number with real part $t$ and imaginary part $-2$.\n\n## Step 6: Equate the two expressions for $|ab|$\nFrom steps 4 and 5, we have $2\\sqrt{26} = \\sqrt{t^2 + 4}$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $t$\nSquaring both sides of the equation gives $(2\\sqrt{26})^2 = t^2 + 4$. Thus, $104 = t^2 + 4$. Subtracting 4 from both sides yields $t^2 = 100$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find $t = \\pm 10$. Since we are asked to find the positive value of $t$, we take $t = 10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
