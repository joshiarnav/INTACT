    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Consider the degree of $p(x)$\nLet $n$ be the degree of $p(x)$. Then the degree of $p(x^3)$ is $3n$, and the degree of $p(x^3 - 2)$ is also $3n$. The degree of $[p(x)]^2 + 12$ is $2n$. Therefore, we have $3n = 2n$, which implies $n = 0$, or the degree of $p(x)$ is $0$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the form of $p(x)$\nSince the degree of $p(x)$ is $0$, $p(x)$ must be a constant polynomial, i.e., $p(x) = c$ for some constant $c$.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute $p(x) = c$ into the equation\nSubstituting $p(x) = c$ into the given equation, we get $c - c = c^2 + 12$, which simplifies to $0 = c^2 + 12$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $c$\nSolving the equation $0 = c^2 + 12$, we get $c^2 = -12$. However, since $p(x)$ has real coefficients, $c$ must be real. But there is no real number $c$ such that $c^2 = -12$. This implies that our initial assumption about the degree of $p(x)$ must be incorrect.\n\n## Step 5: Reconsider the degree of $p(x)$\nGiven that $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) = [p(x)]^2 + 12$, let's assume $p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$. The degree of $p(x^3)$ is $3n$, and the degree of $p(x^3 - 2)$ is $3n$. The degree of $[p(x)]^2 + 12$ is $2n$. For the equation to hold, $3n = 2n$, which is not possible for non-zero $n$, or we consider the case where the leading terms cancel out.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the case where the leading terms cancel out\nFor the leading terms of $p(x^3)$ and $p(x^3 - 2)$ to cancel out, the degree of $p(x)$ must be such that the leading terms of $p(x^3)$ and $p(x^3 - 2)$ are the same. This can happen if $p(x)$ is of degree $3$. Let $p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute $p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ into the equation\nSubstituting $p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ into the equation, we get $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) = [p(x)]^2 + 12$. Expanding both sides and comparing coefficients, we can solve for $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\n\n## Step 8: Expand and compare coefficients\nExpanding $p(x^3)$ and $p(x^3 - 2)$, we get $p(x^3) = ax^9 + bx^6 + cx^3 + d$ and $p(x^3 - 2) = a(x^3 - 2)^3 + b(x^3 - 2)^2 + c(x^3 - 2) + d$. Expanding these expressions and subtracting $p(x^3 - 2)$ from $p(x^3)$, we get $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) = 6ax^6 - 12ax^3 + 6a - 4bx^3 + 4b + 2c$. The right-hand side is $[p(x)]^2 + 12 = (ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)^2 + 12$. Comparing the coefficients of the highest degree terms on both sides, we find $a^2 = 6a$, which implies $a = 0$ or $a = 6$.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$\nTo solve for $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, we need to compare coefficients of corresponding terms on both sides of the equation. Since $a = 0$ or $a = 6$, let's consider both cases. If $a = 0$, the equation simplifies, but we find that this does not lead to a solution that satisfies the original equation for all $x$. Thus, we consider $a = 6$. Comparing coefficients and solving the resulting system of equations, we can determine $b$, $c$, and $d$.\n\n## Step 10: Determine $b$, $c$, and $d$\nAfter comparing coefficients and solving the system of equations, we find that $b = 0$, $c = 0$, and $d = -6$. Therefore, the polynomial $p(x)$ is $p(x) = 6x^3 - 6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6x^3 - 6}$"
