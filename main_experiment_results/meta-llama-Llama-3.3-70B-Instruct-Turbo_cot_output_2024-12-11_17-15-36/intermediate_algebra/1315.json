Subtracting these equations, we get $A = (n + 1) 2^k - n3^k.$  It follows that $B = 3n3^k - 2(n + 1) 2^k,$ which gives us\n\\[\\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})} = \\frac{(n + 1) 2^k - n3^k}{3^k - 2^k} + \\frac{3n3^k - 2(n + 1) 2^k}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}}.\\]We can try setting $n$ to different values, to see what we get.

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recognize the given series as a sum of fractions\nThe given problem involves computing the sum of an infinite series, which is $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})}$. This looks like it can be approached with partial fraction decomposition to simplify the sum.\n\n## Step 2: Apply partial fraction decomposition\nWe start by decomposing $\\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})}$ into partial fractions. Let's express it as $\\frac{A}{3^k - 2^k} + \\frac{B}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}}$. Multiplying both sides by the denominator of the original fraction gives $6^k = A(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}) + B(3^k - 2^k)$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for A and B\nWe need to find suitable values for A and B. To do so, we can choose convenient values of $3^k$ and $2^k$ to make the equation simpler. Setting $3^k = 2^k$ doesn't help directly because it makes the denominators zero, so instead, we solve the equation by comparing coefficients or using the method of equating coefficients.\n\n## Step 4: Use the method of equating coefficients\nFor the equation $6^k = A(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}) + B(3^k - 2^k)$, let's simplify and rearrange terms to solve for A and B. Factoring out common terms gives us $6^k = A \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3^k - A \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2^k + B \\cdot 3^k - B \\cdot 2^k$. Simplifying, $6^k = 3^k(A \\cdot 3 + B) - 2^k(A \\cdot 2 + B)$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine coefficients A and B by comparison\nWe notice that $6^k = (2^k)(3^k)$, so comparing coefficients on both sides, we can solve for A and B by setting up equations based on the powers of $3^k$ and $2^k$. We aim for the coefficients of $3^k$ and $2^k$ to match on both sides of the equation.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the system of equations for A and B\nTo match the coefficients, we observe that $6^k = 2^k \\cdot 3^k$. This implies that we need $(A \\cdot 3 + B) = 2^k$ and $-(A \\cdot 2 + B) = -2^k$ for the $3^k$ and $2^k$ terms respectively, but since these must hold for all k, we look for a simpler relationship. Noticing the structure of the equation suggests setting $A = 2^k$ and $B = -2^{k+1}$ could simplify, but these depend on k. Instead, comparing coefficients directly for the general form, we recognize that we can simplify the fraction using a different approach.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify using a different approach\nLet's simplify the given fraction $\\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})}$ by recognizing a pattern that allows for telescoping. Notice that $\\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})} = \\frac{2^k}{3^k - 2^k} - \\frac{2^{k+1}}{3^{k+1} - 2^{k+1}}$. This step involves recognizing that the numerator $6^k = 2^k \\cdot 3^k$ and using it to break down the fraction.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the telescoping property\nThe series now becomes $\\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{2^k}{3^k - 2^k} - \\frac{2^{k+1}}{3^{k+1} - 2^{k+1}}\\right)$. This is a telescoping series, where consecutive terms cancel out parts of each other.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the telescoping series\nIn a telescoping series, all terms except the first and last cancel out. So, we evaluate the first term and consider the limit of the last term as $k$ approaches infinity. The first term is $\\frac{2^1}{3^1 - 2^1} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$. For the last term, as $k$ approaches infinity, $\\frac{2^{k+1}}{3^{k+1} - 2^{k+1}}$ approaches 0 because $3^{k+1}$ grows faster than $2^{k+1}$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the sum of the series\nSince the series telescopes, we only need the first term, which is 2, and we subtract the limit of the last term as $k$ approaches infinity, which is 0.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
