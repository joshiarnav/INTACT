    "problem": "The domain of the function $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$ is $[0,\\infty)$. What is the range?",
    "solution": "We have $q(x) = (x^2+2)^2$. We wish to determine the set of all $y$ for which $q(x)=y$ has solutions. We must have $y\\ge 0$, since $q(x)$ is a square and squares are nonnegative. Under the assumption $y\\ge 0$, we have:\n$$\\begin{array}{r r@{~=~}l}\n& y & (x^2+2)^2 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & \\sqrt y & x^2+2 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & \\sqrt y-2 & x^2 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$We see that $\\sqrt y-2\\ge 0$ because squares are nonnegative. Thus, we need $y\\ge 4$. When $y\\ge 4$, we have $y=q(x)$ by setting $x$ equal to either of $\\pm \\sqrt{\\sqrt y-2}$, and so any $y\\ge 4$ can be achieved.\n\nTherefore, the range of $q(x)$ is $\\boxed{[4,\\infty)}$.",

Substituting $x = 0$ into the function gives $q(0) = 0^4 + 4(0)^2 + 4 = 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the range of the function based on its behavior and minimum value\nSince $q(x)$ is increasing on $[0, \\infty)$ and the minimum value is $4$, the range of $q(x)$ will start from $4$ and extend to infinity.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[4,\\infty)}$"
