    "problem": "If $a$ is a nonzero integer and $b$ is a positive number such that $ab^2=\\log_{10} b$, what is the median of the set $\\{0, 1, a, b,\n1/b\\}$?",
    "solution": "Because $b<10^b$ for all $b>0$, it follows that $\\log_{10}b<b$.  If $b\\geq 1$, then $0<\\left(\\log_{10}b\\right)/b^2<1$, so $a$ cannot be an integer. Therefore $0<b<1$, so $\\log_{10}b<0$ and $a =\n\\left(\\log_{10}b\\right)/b^2<0$.  Thus $a<0<b<1<1/b$, and the median of the set is $\\boxed{b}$.\n\nNote that the conditions of the problem can be met with $b = 0.1$ and $a = -100$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given equation and its implications\nWe are given the equation $ab^2 = \\log_{10} b$, where $a$ is a nonzero integer and $b$ is a positive number. This equation implies a relationship between $a$, $b$, and the logarithm of $b$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the properties of the logarithmic function\nThe logarithmic function $\\log_{10} b$ is defined only for positive values of $b$. Additionally, the logarithm function increases as $b$ increases, but at a slower rate.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the range of $b$ based on the given equation\nFor the equation $ab^2 = \\log_{10} b$ to hold true, $b$ cannot be very large because the left side of the equation ($ab^2$) would grow much faster than the right side ($\\log_{10} b$). Therefore, $b$ is likely to be close to 1 or less than 1, given the nature of logarithmic growth.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the possible values of $b$ in relation to 1\nSince $b$ is positive, we consider two cases: $b \\geq 1$ and $0 < b < 1$. If $b > 1$, then $\\log_{10} b > 0$, but $ab^2$ would need to be positive and large enough to equal $\\log_{10} b$, which is challenging because $a$ is an integer and $b^2$ would make the left side grow rapidly. If $0 < b < 1$, then $\\log_{10} b < 0$, which means $ab^2 < 0$, implying $a$ must be negative because $b^2$ is always positive.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the ordering of the set $\\{0, 1, a, b, 1/b\\}$\nGiven that $b$ is likely less than 1 (because if $b > 1$, $ab^2$ would be significantly larger than $\\log_{10} b$ due to the squaring of $b$), $1/b > 1$. Since $a$ must be negative to satisfy the equation when $b < 1$, the ordering from smallest to largest is: $a, 0, b, 1, 1/b$.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the median of the set\nThe median of a set is the middle value when the set is ordered. Since we have an odd number of elements (5), the median will be the third element when the set is ordered from smallest to largest.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{b}$"
