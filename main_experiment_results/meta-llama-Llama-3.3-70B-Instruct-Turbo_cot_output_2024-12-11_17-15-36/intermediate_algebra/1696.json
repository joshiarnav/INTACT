    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nWe are given a complex number $z$ such that $z^2 = 24-32i$. The problem asks us to find the absolute value (or modulus) of $z$, denoted as $|z|$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the definition of the absolute value of a complex number\nThe absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is given by $|z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the properties of absolute value to find $|z|$\nWe know that $|z^2| = |z|^2$. Given $z^2 = 24-32i$, we can find $|z^2|$ using the definition from step 2.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $|z^2|$\nFor $z^2 = 24-32i$, $|z^2| = \\sqrt{24^2 + (-32)^2} = \\sqrt{576 + 1024} = \\sqrt{1600} = 40$.\n\n## Step 5: Find $|z|$\nSince $|z^2| = |z|^2$, we have $|z|^2 = 40$. Therefore, $|z| = \\sqrt{40} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10} = 2\\sqrt{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{10}}$"
