    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the given expression as a difference of squares\nThe given expression $64x^6-729y^6$ can be seen as a difference of squares since $64x^6 = (8x^3)^2$ and $729y^6 = (27y^3)^2$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the difference of squares formula to the given expression\nUsing the difference of squares formula $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$, we can rewrite the expression as $(8x^3 + 27y^3)(8x^3 - 27y^3)$.\n\n## Step 3: Recognize $8x^3 + 27y^3$ and $8x^3 - 27y^3$ as sums and differences of cubes\n$8x^3 + 27y^3$ can be seen as $(2x)^3 + (3y)^3$ and $8x^3 - 27y^3$ can be seen as $(2x)^3 - (3y)^3$.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the sum and difference of cubes formulas\nThe sum of cubes formula is $a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)$ and the difference of cubes formula is $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$. Applying these, we get:\n- For $8x^3 + 27y^3 = (2x)^3 + (3y)^3 = (2x + 3y)((2x)^2 - (2x)(3y) + (3y)^2) = (2x + 3y)(4x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2)$\n- For $8x^3 - 27y^3 = (2x)^3 - (3y)^3 = (2x - 3y)((2x)^2 + (2x)(3y) + (3y)^2) = (2x - 3y)(4x^2 + 6xy + 9y^2)$\n\n## Step 5: Combine the results of the factorization\nCombining the results from step 4, the expression $64x^6-729y^6$ can be factored as $(2x + 3y)(4x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2)(2x - 3y)(4x^2 + 6xy + 9y^2)$.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the coefficients a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, j, and k\nFrom the factorization, we can identify:\n- $a = 2$, $b = 3$\n- $c = 4$, $d = -6$, $e = 9$\n- $f = 2$, $g = -3$\n- $h = 4$, $j = 6$, $k = 9$\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the sum of the coefficients\nThe sum of the coefficients $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, $f$, $g$, $h$, $j$, and $k$ is $2 + 3 + 4 - 6 + 9 + 2 - 3 + 4 + 6 + 9$.\n\n## Step 8: Perform the final addition\n$2 + 3 + 4 - 6 + 9 + 2 - 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 = 30$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$"
