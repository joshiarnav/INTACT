    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Simplify each term in the product\nWe start by simplifying each term in the given product. For the first term, $\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, simplifying yields $\\frac{1}{2}$. For the second term, $\\left(1-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)$, simplifying yields $\\frac{2}{3}$. Continuing this pattern, we notice that the $n$th term simplifies to $\\frac{n}{n+1}$.\n\n## Step 2: Express the product using the simplified terms\nNow, we express the entire product using these simplified terms:\n$\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\cdot\\left(1-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\cdot\\left(1-\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\dotsm \\left(1-\\frac{1}{n+1}\\right) \\dotsm \\left(1-\\frac{1}{100}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} \\dotsm \\frac{n}{n+1} \\dotsm \\frac{99}{100}$.\n\n## Step 3: Notice the cancellations in the numerator and denominator\nUpon inspection, we see that the numerator of each fraction cancels with the denominator of the next fraction. For example, the 2 in the numerator of $\\frac{1}{2}$ cancels with the 2 in the denominator of $\\frac{2}{3}$, and so on, until we reach the last term.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the final fraction after cancellations\nAfter all the cancellations, we are left with $\\frac{1}{100}$ as the final fraction, since the 1 in the numerator of the first term does not cancel with anything, and the 100 in the denominator of the last term does not cancel with anything.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{100}}$"
