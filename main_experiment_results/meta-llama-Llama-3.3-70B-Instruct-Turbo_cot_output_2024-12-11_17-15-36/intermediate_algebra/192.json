    "solution": "The horizontal asymptote of $f$ is the horizontal line that $f$ approaches as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. When the leading terms of the numerator and denominator have the same degree, that line is at the value equal to the ratio of the leading coefficients, namely $y = 2/1 = 2$. Setting this equal to $f(x)$, $$f(x) = 2 = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}.$$Clearing the denominator, $$2(x^2 - 4x + 1) = 2x^2 - 8x + 2 = 2x^2 - 5x - 7 \\Longrightarrow 3x = 9 \\Longrightarrow x = \\boxed{3}.$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the horizontal asymptote of the function\nTo find the horizontal asymptote of the function $f(x) = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}$, we need to consider the behavior of the function as $x$ approaches infinity. The horizontal asymptote can be found by comparing the degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and denominator. Since both the numerator and denominator have the same degree (which is 2), the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients of the numerator and denominator.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the horizontal asymptote\nThe leading coefficient of the numerator is 2, and the leading coefficient of the denominator is 1. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is $y = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$.\n\n## Step 3: Set the function equal to its horizontal asymptote and solve for $x$\nTo find where the function crosses its horizontal asymptote, we set $f(x)$ equal to the horizontal asymptote and solve for $x$. So, we have $\\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1} = 2$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for $x$\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $x^2 - 4x + 1$ to clear the denominator gives $2x^2 - 5x - 7 = 2(x^2 - 4x + 1)$. Expanding the right side gives $2x^2 - 5x - 7 = 2x^2 - 8x + 2$. Subtracting $2x^2$ from both sides to simplify yields $-5x - 7 = -8x + 2$. Adding $8x$ to both sides gives $3x - 7 = 2$. Adding 7 to both sides gives $3x = 9$. Dividing both sides by 3 gives $x = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
