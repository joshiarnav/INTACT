    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the Complex Conjugate Root Theorem\nThe Complex Conjugate Root Theorem states that if a complex number is a root of a polynomial equation with real coefficients, then its complex conjugate is also a root of the equation. Since $-2 - 3i$ is a root, its complex conjugate, $-2 + 3i$, is also a root.\n\n## Step 2: Form the Quadratic Equation Having the Given Roots\nUsing the roots $-2 - 3i$ and $-2 + 3i$, we can form a quadratic equation that has these roots. The product of the roots is $(-2 - 3i)(-2 + 3i) = (-2)^2 - (3i)^2 = 4 + 9 = 13$. The sum of the roots is $(-2 - 3i) + (-2 + 3i) = -4$. Thus, the quadratic equation having these roots can be written as $x^2 + 4x + 13 = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the Factor Theorem\nBy the Factor Theorem, if $x^2 + 4x + 13 = 0$ has roots that are also roots of the cubic polynomial $ax^3 + 3x^2 + bx - 65 = 0$, then $x^2 + 4x + 13$ is a factor of $ax^3 + 3x^2 + bx - 65$. We can express the cubic polynomial as a product of this quadratic and a linear factor: $ax^3 + 3x^2 + bx - 65 = (x^2 + 4x + 13)(ax - c)$, where $c$ is a constant to be determined.\n\n## Step 4: Expand the Product and Match Coefficients\nExpanding the product $(x^2 + 4x + 13)(ax - c)$ gives $ax^3 + (4a - c)x^2 + (13a - 4c)x - 13c$. Matching coefficients of this expansion with the cubic polynomial $ax^3 + 3x^2 + bx - 65$, we get the following equations:\n1. $4a - c = 3$\n2. $13a - 4c = b$\n3. $-13c = -65$\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $c$ and Then for $a$\nFrom equation 3, solving for $c$ gives $c = 5$. Substituting $c = 5$ into equation 1 gives $4a - 5 = 3$, which simplifies to $4a = 8$, and thus $a = 2$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the Real Root\nNow that we have $a = 2$ and $c = 5$, the linear factor is $2x - 5$. Setting this equal to zero to find the real root gives $2x - 5 = 0$. Solving for $x$ yields $x = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$"
