    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the equation and the goal\nWe need to find all solutions for the equation \\(\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + \\sqrt{x - 1} = 1\\). This involves manipulating the equation to isolate \\(x\\).\n\n## Step 2: Isolate one of the radicals\nTo simplify the equation, let's isolate one of the radicals. We can start by isolating \\(\\sqrt{x - 1}\\). So, we rearrange the equation to get \\(\\sqrt{x - 1} = 1 - \\sqrt[3]{2 - x}\\).\n\n## Step 3: Square both sides to remove the square root\nTo remove the square root, we square both sides of the equation: \\((\\sqrt{x - 1})^2 = (1 - \\sqrt[3]{2 - x})^2\\). This simplifies to \\(x - 1 = 1 - 2\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + (\\sqrt[3]{2 - x})^2\\).\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying, we get \\(x - 1 = 1 - 2\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + (2 - x)^{2/3}\\). Let's further simplify this to \\(x - 2 = -2\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + (2 - x)^{2/3}\\).\n\n## Step 5: Rearrange and isolate terms with radicals\nRearranging gives us \\(x - 2 + 2\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} = (2 - x)^{2/3}\\). To make it easier to solve, let's substitute \\(y = \\sqrt[3]{2 - x}\\), which means \\(y^3 = 2 - x\\) or \\(x = 2 - y^3\\).\n\n## Step 6: Substitute \\(y\\) into the equation\nSubstituting \\(x = 2 - y^3\\) into the equation gives us \\(2 - y^3 - 2 + 2y = y^2\\), simplifying to \\(-y^3 + 2y = y^2\\).\n\n## Step 7: Rearrange the equation in terms of \\(y\\)\nRearranging gives us \\(y^3 + y^2 - 2y = 0\\). Factoring out \\(y\\), we get \\(y(y^2 + y - 2) = 0\\), which further factors to \\(y(y + 2)(y - 1) = 0\\).\n\n## Step 8: Solve for \\(y\\)\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us \\(y = 0\\), \\(y = -2\\), or \\(y = 1\\).\n\n## Step 9: Solve for \\(x\\) using \\(y\\)\nRecall that \\(y = \\sqrt[3]{2 - x}\\). So, for \\(y = 0\\), we have \\(\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} = 0\\), which gives \\(x = 2\\). For \\(y = -2\\), \\(\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} = -2\\), which gives \\(2 - x = -8\\) or \\(x = 10\\). For \\(y = 1\\), \\(\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} = 1\\), which gives \\(2 - x = 1\\) or \\(x = 1\\).\n\n## Step 10: Check the solutions in the original equation\nWe need to check each \\(x\\) value in the original equation to ensure they are valid solutions. For \\(x = 2\\), \\(\\sqrt[3]{2 - 2} + \\sqrt{2 - 1} = \\sqrt[3]{0} + \\sqrt{1} = 0 + 1 = 1\\), which is valid. For \\(x = 10\\), \\(\\sqrt[3]{2 - 10} + \\sqrt{10 - 1} = \\sqrt[3]{-8} + \\sqrt{9} = -2 + 3 = 1\\), which is valid. For \\(x = 1\\), \\(\\sqrt[3]{2 - 1} + \\sqrt{1 - 1} = \\sqrt[3]{1} + \\sqrt{0} = 1 + 0 = 1\\), which is valid.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1,2,10}$"
