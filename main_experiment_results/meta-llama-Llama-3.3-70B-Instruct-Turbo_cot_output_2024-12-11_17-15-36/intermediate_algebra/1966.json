    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand what a geometric sequence is.\nA geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.\n\n## Step 2: Define the terms of the geometric sequence.\nGiven $a_1 = 1$, and the common ratio is $r$, we have $a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r = 1 \\cdot r = r$ and $a_3 = a_2 \\cdot r = r \\cdot r = r^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Express $4a_2 + 5a_3$ in terms of $r$.\nSubstituting $a_2 = r$ and $a_3 = r^2$ into the expression gives $4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the minimum value of $4r + 5r^2$.\nTo find the minimum value of the quadratic expression $5r^2 + 4r$, we can complete the square or use the formula for the vertex of a parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, which is $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. In our case, $a = 5$ and $b = 4$, so $r = -\\frac{4}{2 \\cdot 5} = -\\frac{2}{5}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the minimum value of $4r + 5r^2$ using $r = -\\frac{2}{5}$.\nSubstitute $r = -\\frac{2}{5}$ into the expression $4r + 5r^2$ to get $4\\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right) + 5\\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{8}{5} + 5\\left(\\frac{4}{25}\\right) = -\\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{4}{5} = -\\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}}$"
