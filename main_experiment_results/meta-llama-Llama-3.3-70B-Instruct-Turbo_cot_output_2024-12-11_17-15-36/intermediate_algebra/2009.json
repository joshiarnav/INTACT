    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$, we first need to replace $f(x)$ with $y$ and then swap $x$ and $y$.\nWe start with $y = \\frac{2x + 3}{kx - 2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Swap $x$ and $y$ to begin finding the inverse function.\nThis gives us $x = \\frac{2y + 3}{ky - 2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $y$ to find the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$.\nFirst, multiply both sides by $ky - 2$ to get $x(ky - 2) = 2y + 3$.\nThis simplifies to $kxy - 2x = 2y + 3$.\nRearrange the equation to get $kxy - 2y = 2x + 3$.\nFactor out $y$ to get $y(kx - 2) = 2x + 3$.\nThen, solve for $y$ to get $y = \\frac{2x + 3}{kx - 2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Since $f^{-1}(x) = f(x)$, the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ must be equal to the original function $f(x)$.\nThis means $\\frac{2x + 3}{kx - 2} = f(x)$ is its own inverse.\n\n## Step 5: For $f(x)$ to be its own inverse, the graph of $f(x)$ must be symmetrical about the line $y = x$.\nThis condition is met when the function's inverse is the same as the function itself, which implies a specific relationship between the coefficients of $x$ in the function and its inverse.\n\n## Step 6: Given $f(x) = \\frac{2x + 3}{kx - 2}$, for it to be equal to its inverse, the coefficients must satisfy a specific condition that reflects the symmetry.\nSince $f(x) = f^{-1}(x)$, comparing the coefficients, we notice that for the function to be its own inverse, $k$ must make the function symmetric about $y = x$.\n\n## Step 7: To find the value of $k$ that makes $f(x)$ symmetric about $y = x$, and thus its own inverse, we need to ensure that the function's graph reflects onto itself across $y = x$.\nThis implies that $k$ must satisfy a condition where the function's behavior is mirrored, meaning if $(a, b)$ is on the graph, then $(b, a)$ must also be on the graph.\n\n## Step 8: Given the specific form of $f(x)$, to satisfy the condition of being its own inverse, we equate $f(x)$ to $x$ and solve for $k$ because if $f(x) = f^{-1}(x)$, then $f(f(x)) = x$.\nSubstituting $f(x)$ into itself should yield $x$, which gives us a way to find $k$.\n\n## Step 9: Substitute $f(x) = \\frac{2x + 3}{kx - 2}$ into $f(f(x)) = x$.\nThis means $f(f(x)) = \\frac{2(\\frac{2x + 3}{kx - 2}) + 3}{k(\\frac{2x + 3}{kx - 2}) - 2} = x$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the equation $f(f(x)) = x$ to solve for $k$.\nWe get $\\frac{2(2x + 3) + 3(kx - 2)}{k(2x + 3) - 2(kx - 2)} = x$.\nSimplifying further, $\\frac{4x + 6 + 3kx - 6}{2kx + 3k - 2kx + 4} = x$.\nThis reduces to $\\frac{(3k + 4)x}{3k + 4} = x$.\nFor this equation to hold true for all $x$, the coefficients must be such that the equation is an identity.\n\n## Step 11: From the simplified equation, we can see that for the equation to be an identity, $3k + 4$ must not be zero, but since it cancels out, we need to look at the original condition for $f(x)$ to be its own inverse.\nThe condition for a function to be its own inverse graphically implies a specific relationship between its coefficients, which often leads to a quadratic equation when substituting $f(x)$ into itself.\n\n## Step 12: Realizing the step to solve for $k$ directly from the function being its own inverse involves recognizing that $f(x) = x$ when substituted into the equation yields a specific condition for $k$.\nGiven the nature of the function and its inverse being the same, we examine the behavior of the function under this constraint.\n\n## Step 13: Since $f(x)$ is a rational function and is its own inverse, we look for $k$ such that the function's behavior is consistent with being symmetric about $y = x$.\nThis implies a specific relationship between the coefficients that can be derived from the function's definition and the condition that it is its own inverse.\n\n## Step 14: Upon careful examination, the condition that $f(x)$ is its own inverse implies that the graph of $f(x)$ must be symmetric with respect to the line $y = x$.\nFor rational functions of this form, this symmetry often corresponds to a specific relationship between the coefficients of $x$ in the numerator and denominator.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{3}}$"
