Factoring gives $(a^2-25)(a^2-12) = 0$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $a^2$\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives $a^2 = 25$ or $a^2 = 12$. Since $a$ must be an integer, $a^2 = 25$ is the appropriate choice, yielding $a = 5$.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for $b$\nWith $a = 5$, substituting back into $b = \\frac{10}{a}$ gives $b = \\frac{10}{5} = 2$.\n\n## Step 10: Write the simplified expression\nThus, $\\sqrt{37-20\\sqrt3} = 5-2\\sqrt3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5-2\\sqrt3}$"
