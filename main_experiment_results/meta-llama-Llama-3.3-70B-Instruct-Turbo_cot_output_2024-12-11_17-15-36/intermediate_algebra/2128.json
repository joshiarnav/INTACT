    "problem": "One of the asymptotes of a hyperbola has equation $y=3x.$ The foci of the hyperbola have the same $x-$coordinate, which is $5.$ Find the equation of the other asymptote of the hyperbola, giving your answer in the form \"$y = mx + b$\".",
    "solution": "Because the foci both lie on the line $x=5$ and the center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the segment connecting the foci, the center must also lie on the line $x=5.$ However, we also know that the asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at the center. Therefore, the center of the hyperbola lies on both the line $x=5$ and the line $y=3x,$ so its coordinates are $(5, 15).$\n\nBecause the hyperbola has a horizontal axis, the other asymptote must have slope $-3.$ Therefore, we can write a point-slope equation for the other asymptote: \\[y - 15 = -3(x - 5),\\]which is equivalent to $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the definition of a hyperbola and its asymptotes\nA hyperbola is defined as the set of all points such that the absolute value of the difference between the distances from two fixed points (foci) is constant. The asymptotes of a hyperbola are its non-linear lines that the hyperbola approaches but never touches.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the properties of hyperbola asymptotes\nThe asymptotes of a hyperbola intersect at its center. Since the foci have the same x-coordinate, the hyperbola is vertical, and its asymptotes are symmetric with respect to the vertical line through the center.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the equation of the other asymptote\nSince one asymptote has the equation $y = 3x$ and the asymptotes are symmetric with respect to a vertical line, the other asymptote must have a slope of $-3$ to maintain symmetry.\n\n## Step 4: Find the center of the hyperbola\nThe center of the hyperbola lies on the line $x = 5$ (the same x-coordinate as the foci) and on the line $y = 3x$ (one of the asymptotes). So, the y-coordinate of the center can be found by substituting $x = 5$ into $y = 3x$, which gives $y = 3(5) = 15$. Thus, the center of the hyperbola is at $(5, 15)$.\n\n## Step 5: Use the point-slope form to find the equation of the other asymptote\nUsing the point-slope form $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line, we can find the equation of the other asymptote. The slope $m$ is $-3$, and the point $(x_1, y_1)$ is the center of the hyperbola, which is $(5, 15)$. Substituting these values into the point-slope form gives $y - 15 = -3(x - 5)$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the equation\nExpanding the equation $y - 15 = -3(x - 5)$ gives $y - 15 = -3x + 15$. Adding $15$ to both sides gives $y = -3x + 30$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}$"
