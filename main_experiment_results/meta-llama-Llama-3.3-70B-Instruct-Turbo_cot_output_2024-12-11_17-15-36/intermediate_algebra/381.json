However, since we are looking for positive real solutions, $x=0$ does not satisfy this condition.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the second factor for positive real solutions\nNow, we need to consider the equation $x^4+7x^3+14x^2+1729x-1379=0$ for positive real solutions. To determine the number of positive real roots, we can use Descartes' Rule of Signs.\n\n## Step 4: Apply Descartes' Rule of Signs\nAccording to Descartes' Rule of Signs, the number of positive real roots in a polynomial is either equal to the number of sign changes in the coefficients of the polynomial or less than that by a multiple of 2. For the polynomial $x^4+7x^3+14x^2+1729x-1379$, there is one sign change (from positive to negative at the last term), which means there is exactly one positive real root.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
