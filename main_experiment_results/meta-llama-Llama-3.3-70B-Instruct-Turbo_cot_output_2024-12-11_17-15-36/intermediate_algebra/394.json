    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are tasked with finding the sum of the floors of the base-2 logarithms of the numbers from 1 to 1024.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the pattern of floor of log2 N\nThe floor of log2 N increases by 1 every time N doubles. This means for N = 1, floor(log2 N) = 0; for N = 2, floor(log2 N) = 1; for N = 3 and N = 4, floor(log2 N) = 1 and 2 respectively. In general, for N ranging from 2^k to 2^(k+1) - 1, floor(log2 N) = k.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of terms for each value of floor(log2 N)\nFor each k from 0 to 10 (since 2^10 = 1024), there are 2^k terms where floor(log2 N) = k. This is because each range from 2^k to 2^(k+1) - 1 contains 2^k terms.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum\nTo find the sum, we calculate the contribution of each k. For k = 0, the term is 0 and there's 1 term (N=1), so the contribution is 0*1 = 0. For k = 1, the term is 1 and there's 2 terms (N=2,3), so the contribution is 1*2 = 2. For k = 2, the term is 2 and there are 4 terms, so the contribution is 2*4 = 8. In general, for each k, the contribution is k * 2^k.\n\n## Step 5: Sum the contributions for k = 0 to 10\nWe sum the contributions for each k: 0*1 + 1*2 + 2*4 + 3*8 + ... + 10*1024. This can be written as the sum of k * 2^k from k = 0 to 10.\n\n## Step 6: Use the formula for sum of k * 2^k\nThere's a formula to simplify this: sum from k = 0 to n of k * 2^k = 2 + (n-1) * 2^(n+1) - n * 2^n - 2, for n >= 1. However, considering our specific case and ensuring accuracy, let's directly compute it or apply a simpler method considering the series' characteristics.\n\n## Step 7: Direct computation or simplification\nSince direct application of the formula might be tricky without verifying its correctness for our specific bounds, let's consider the sum in parts: for each k, we have k * 2^k. This can also be seen as the derivative of a series which can simplify the computation.\n\n## Step 8: Compute the series\nLet's simplify by directly computing the series with the understanding that for each k, we have 2^k terms contributing k to the sum, except for the last term where k = 10, which only goes up to 1024, not 2^11 - 1.\n\n## Step 9: Adjust for the last term\nFor k = 10, we only consider up to 1024, which means all 2^10 = 1024 terms contribute 10 to the sum.\n\n## Step 10: Final calculation\nSum = 0*1 + 1*2 + 2*4 + 3*8 + 4*16 + 5*32 + 6*64 + 7*128 + 8*256 + 9*512 + 10*1024.\n\n## Step 11: Perform the calculation\nSum = 0 + 2 + 8 + 24 + 64 + 160 + 384 + 896 + 2048 + 4608 + 10240.\n\n## Step 12: Add the numbers\nPerforming the addition: 0 + 2 + 8 + 24 + 64 + 160 + 384 + 896 + 2048 + 4608 + 10240 = 0 + 2 + 8 + 24 + 64 + 160 + 384 + 896 + 2048 + 4608 + 10240.\n\n## Step 13: Final addition\n0 + 2 + 8 + 24 = 34, 34 + 64 = 98, 98 + 160 = 258, 258 + 384 = 642, 642 + 896 = 1538, 1538 + 2048 = 3586, 3586 + 4608 = 8194, 8194 + 10240 = 18434.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18434}$"
