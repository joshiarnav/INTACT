    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given function and conditions\nThe function $f(z) = i\\overline{z}$ involves the complex conjugate of $z$ and multiplication by $i$, where $z$ is a complex number. We need to find $z$ that satisfies both $|z| = 5$ and $f(z) = z$.\n\n## Step 2: Express $z$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts\nLet $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit. The complex conjugate of $z$ is $\\overline{z} = a - bi$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the function $f(z)$ to $z = a + bi$\nSubstituting $z = a + bi$ into $f(z) = i\\overline{z}$ gives $f(z) = i(a - bi) = ia - i^2b = ia + b$.\n\n## Step 4: Set $f(z) = z$ and simplify\nSetting $f(z) = z$, we have $ia + b = a + bi$. This implies $ia = a$ and $b = bi$ for the real and imaginary parts to be equal.\n\n## Step 5: Solve $ia = a$ and $b = bi$\nFrom $ia = a$, we get $a(i - 1) = 0$. This means either $a = 0$ or $i - 1 = 0$, but since $i - 1 \\neq 0$, we must have $a = 0$. For $b = bi$, we have $b(1 - i) = 0$. This implies either $b = 0$ or $1 - i = 0$, but since $1 - i \\neq 0$, we must have $b = 0$ or the equation is satisfied when $b$ is purely imaginary, which does not apply here as $b$ is real.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the condition $|z| = 5$\nGiven $|z| = 5$, and $z = a + bi$, we have $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 5$. Since we found $a = 0$ from the condition $f(z) = z$, this simplifies to $\\sqrt{0^2 + b^2} = 5$, or $|b| = 5$. This means $b = 5$ or $b = -5$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the number of solutions for $z$\nGiven $a = 0$ and $b = 5$ or $b = -5$, there are two possible values for $z$: $z = 0 + 5i = 5i$ and $z = 0 - 5i = -5i$. Thus, there are two values of $z$ that satisfy both conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
