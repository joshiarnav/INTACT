    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Use the Remainder Theorem for the division by $x - 1$\nAccording to the Remainder Theorem, if a polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by $x - c$, the remainder is $f(c)$. Therefore, when $f(x)$ is divided by $x - 1$, we substitute $x = 1$ into $f(x)$ to find the remainder. So, $f(1) = a(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + b(1) - 5 = a - 6 + b - 5 = a + b - 11$. We are given that this remainder is $-5$, so we have the equation $a + b - 11 = -5$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the equation from Step 1\nSimplifying the equation $a + b - 11 = -5$, we get $a + b = 6$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the Remainder Theorem for the division by $x + 2$\nSimilarly, for division by $x + 2$, we substitute $x = -2$ into $f(x)$ to find the remainder. So, $f(-2) = a(-2)^3 - 6(-2)^2 + b(-2) - 5 = -8a - 24 - 2b - 5 = -8a - 2b - 29$. We are given that this remainder is $-53$, so we have the equation $-8a - 2b - 29 = -53$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation from Step 3\nSimplifying the equation $-8a - 2b - 29 = -53$, we get $-8a - 2b = -24$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the system of equations\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n1. $a + b = 6$\n2. $-8a - 2b = -24$\n\nWe can solve this system for $a$ and $b$. First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing everything by $-2$, which gives us $4a + b = 12$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $a$ and $b$\nSubtracting the first equation from this new form of the second equation, we get $(4a + b) - (a + b) = 12 - 6$, which simplifies to $3a = 6$. Therefore, $a = 2$.\n\n## Step 7: Find $b$ using $a = 2$\nSubstituting $a = 2$ into the equation $a + b = 6$, we get $2 + b = 6$. Solving for $b$, we find $b = 4$.\n\n## Step 8: Write the solution as an ordered pair\nThus, the ordered pair $(a, b)$ is $(2, 4)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(2, 4)}$"
