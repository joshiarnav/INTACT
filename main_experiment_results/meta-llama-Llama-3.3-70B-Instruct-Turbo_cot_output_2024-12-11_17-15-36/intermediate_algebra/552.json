    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the recursive relation\nWe are given a sequence of real numbers $a_n$ that satisfies the recursive relation $a_n = a_{n - 1} a_{n + 1}$ for all $n \\ge 2$. This means that each term in the sequence is the product of the previous term and the next term.\n\n## Step 2: Express $a_{n+1}$ in terms of $a_n$ and $a_{n-1}$\nFrom the given relation $a_n = a_{n - 1} a_{n + 1}$, we can express $a_{n+1}$ as $a_{n+1} = \\frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}}$. This will help us in finding a pattern in the sequence.\n\n## Step 3: Find the pattern in the sequence\nLet's calculate a few terms to see if there's a pattern. Given $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$, we can find $a_2, a_3, ...$ and observe any recurring pattern.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $a_2$\nUsing the relation $a_n = a_{n - 1} a_{n + 1}$ and given $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$, $a_3$ can be expressed in terms of $a_2$ and $a_1$. However, without $a_3$, we cannot directly find $a_2$. We need another approach to find the pattern or use the given $a_{1776}$ to establish a relationship.\n\n## Step 5: Establish a relationship using $a_{1776}$\nGiven $a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$, and knowing the sequence's recursive nature, let's examine how terms relate to each other over larger indices, considering the given equation might simplify or show periodic behavior over certain intervals.\n\n## Step 6: Investigate periodic behavior\nGiven the nature of the equation, let's see if the sequence exhibits periodic behavior. If $a_{n+1} = \\frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}}$, then $a_{n+2} = \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\frac{1}{a_{n-1}}$. Continuing this pattern, $a_{n+3} = a_{n-1}$ and $a_{n+4} = a_n$. This indicates a periodic sequence with a period of 6, since after 6 steps, the pattern repeats: $a_{n+6} = a_n$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine $a_{2009}$ using periodicity\nSince the sequence has a period of 6, we can reduce the index of $a_{2009}$ by subtracting multiples of 6 until we get an index that is close to the given terms $a_1$ or $a_{1776}$. Notice that $2009 \\mod 6 = 5$, and $1776 \\mod 6 = 6$, which means $1776$ is a multiple of 6. Therefore, $a_{1776}$ and $a_6$ are in the same position in the sequence's cycle, and since $a_6 = a_0$ (if we were to extend the sequence backwards), it implies $a_6$ would have a specific relationship with $a_1$ and $a_5$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate $a_5$ and $a_6$\nSince $a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$ and it corresponds to $a_6$ in the cycle, and knowing $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$, we can find $a_5$ using the periodic nature and the given values. Given the periodicity, $a_5$ would be the term right before $a_6$ in the cycle, which corresponds to $a_{1775}$.\n\n## Step 9: Find the relationship between $a_5$ and $a_6$\nSince $a_6 = \\frac{a_5}{a_4}$ and $a_5 = \\frac{a_4}{a_3}$, continuing this pattern backwards, we notice that to find $a_5$, we need to understand the relationship between consecutive terms. Given $a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$, we can imply $a_6 = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$ because of the periodicity.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate $a_5$\nSince $a_5$ and $a_6$ are consecutive terms in the sequence's cycle, and knowing $a_6 = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$, we use the relationship $a_{n+1} = \\frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}}$ to find $a_5$. However, we lack $a_4$ directly. Considering the periodic nature and that $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$, $a_7 = a_1$, implying a cycle, we need to leverage the given information and periodicity to directly find $a_5$ or use the relation to express $a_5$ in terms of $a_6$ and $a_4$, which might not be straightforward without $a_4$.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify using periodicity and given terms\nSince $a_{2009}$ corresponds to $a_5$ in the sequence's cycle, and we know $a_{1776} = a_6 = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$, we use the fact that $a_5 \\cdot a_6 = a_7 = a_1$ due to the periodic nature of the sequence. Thus, $a_5 \\cdot (13 + \\sqrt{7}) = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$.\n\n## Step 12: Solve for $a_5$\nWe solve the equation $a_5 \\cdot (13 + \\sqrt{7}) = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$ for $a_5$. This gives $a_5 = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{7}}{13 + \\sqrt{7}}$.\n\n## Step 13: Rationalize the denominator\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator: $a_5 = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{7}}{13 + \\sqrt{7}} \\cdot \\frac{13 - \\sqrt{7}}{13 - \\sqrt{7}}$.\n\n## Step 14: Perform the multiplication\nMultiplying gives $a_5 = \\frac{(1 + \\sqrt{7})(13 - \\sqrt{7})}{(13 + \\sqrt{7})(13 - \\sqrt{7})} = \\frac{13 - \\sqrt{7} + 13\\sqrt{7} - 7}{169 - 7}$.\n\n## Step 15: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying yields $a_5 = \\frac{6 + 12\\sqrt{7}}{162} = \\frac{1 + 2\\sqrt{7}}{27}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1 + 2\\sqrt{7}}{27}}$"
