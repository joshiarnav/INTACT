    "problem": "For how many real values of $c$ do we have $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$?",
    "solution": "We have $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\sqrt{{\\frac12}^2 + (-c)^2} = \\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14}$, so $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ gives us $\\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14} = \\frac34$.  Squaring both sides gives $c^2 + \\frac14 = \\frac9{16}$, so $c^2=\\frac5{16}$.  Taking the square root of both sides gives $c = \\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ and $c=-\\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ as solutions, so there are $\\boxed{2}$ real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nWe also could have solved this equation by noting that $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ means that the complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is $\\frac34$ units from the origin in the complex plane.  Therefore, it is on the circle centered at the origin with radius $\\frac34$.  The complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is also on the vertical line that intersects the real axis at $\\frac12$, which is inside the aforementioned circle.  Since this line goes inside the circle, it must intersect the circle at $\\boxed{2}$ points, which correspond to the values of $c$ that satisfy the original equation.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the definition of the absolute value of a complex number\nThe absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number $a + bi$ is defined as $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the definition to the given complex number\nFor the complex number $\\frac{1}{2} - ci$, the absolute value is $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + (-c)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} + c^2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the given condition\nWe are given that $\\left|\\frac{1}{2} - ci\\right| = \\frac{3}{4}$. Substituting the expression for the absolute value from Step 2, we get $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} + c^2} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for $c$\nSquaring both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root gives $\\frac{1}{4} + c^2 = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{16}$. Subtracting $\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{4}{16}$ from both sides yields $c^2 = \\frac{9}{16} - \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{5}{16}$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation\nTaking the square root of both sides gives $c = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{16}}$. Thus, $c = \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}$.\n\n## Step 6: Count the number of real values of $c$\nSince $c$ can be either $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}$ or $-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}$, there are 2 real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
