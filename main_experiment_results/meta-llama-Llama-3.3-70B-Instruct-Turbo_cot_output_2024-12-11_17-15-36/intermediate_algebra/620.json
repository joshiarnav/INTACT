    "solution": "An example of a quadratic function with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ is $(x-2)(x-4)$. However, when $x=3$, this function takes the value $-1$. However, multiplying the entire quadratic by $-6$ does not change the location of the zeroes, and does give us the desired value at $x=3$.\n\nThus, $-6(x-2)(x-4)$ has all the desired properties. The expanded form of this expression is $\\boxed{-6x^2+36x-48}$.\n\nNote that this is the only such quadratic. Any quadratic must factor as $a(x-r)(x-s)$, where its zeroes are $r$ and $s$; thus a quadratic with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ must be of the form $a(x-2)(x-4)$, and the coefficient $a=-6$ is forced by the value at $x=3$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the quadratic function with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$, we start by noting that if a quadratic function has zeroes at $x=p$ and $x=q$, it can be written in the form $a(x-p)(x-q)$, where $a$ is a constant.\n\nGiven the zeroes are at $x=2$ and $x=4$, our quadratic function can be written as $a(x-2)(x-4)$.\n\nNow, we are also given that the function takes the value $6$ when $x=3$. We can substitute $x=3$ into our function to find $a$:\n\n$a(3-2)(3-4) = 6$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$a(1)(-1) = 6$\n\n$a(-1) = 6$\n\n$a = -6$\n\nSo, the quadratic function that meets the given conditions is $-6(x-2)(x-4)$.\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n$-6(x^2 - 4x - 2x + 8)$\n\n$-6(x^2 - 6x + 8)$\n\n$-6x^2 + 36x - 48$\n\nTherefore, the quadratic function in the expanded form is $\\boxed{-6x^2 + 36x - 48}$."
