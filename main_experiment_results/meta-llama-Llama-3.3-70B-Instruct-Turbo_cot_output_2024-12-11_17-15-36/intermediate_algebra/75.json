    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the mid-point of a line segment in the complex plane, we need to average the real parts and the imaginary parts of the end-points separately.\nThe formula for finding the mid-point of two complex numbers $z_1 = a + bi$ and $z_2 = c + di$ is given by $\\frac{z_1 + z_2}{2} = \\frac{(a + c)}{2} + \\frac{(b + d)}{2}i$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the real and imaginary parts of the given end-points.\nFor the complex number $-11 + 3i$, the real part $a = -11$ and the imaginary part $b = 3$.\nFor the complex number $3 - 7i$, the real part $c = 3$ and the imaginary part $d = -7$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the mid-point formula using the identified real and imaginary parts.\nUsing the formula from Step 1, we calculate the mid-point as $\\frac{(-11 + 3)}{2} + \\frac{(3 + (-7))}{2}i$.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the arithmetic to find the mid-point.\nCalculate the real part: $\\frac{-11 + 3}{2} = \\frac{-8}{2} = -4$.\nCalculate the imaginary part: $\\frac{3 - 7}{2} = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2$.\nThus, the mid-point is $-4 - 2i$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-4 - 2i}$"
