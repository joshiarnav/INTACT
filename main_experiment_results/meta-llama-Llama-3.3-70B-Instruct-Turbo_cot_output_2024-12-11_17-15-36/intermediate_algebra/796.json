The first circle, $C_1$, has a center at $(0,0)$ and a radius of $1$. The second circle, $C_2$, has a center at $(2,0)$ and a radius of $4$.\n\n## Step 2: Denote the center of the desired circle as $(a,b)$ and its radius as $r$\nLet's denote the center of the circle that is externally tangent to $C_1$ and internally tangent to $C_2$ as $(a,b)$, and its radius as $r$.\n\n## Step 3: Establish the relationships based on the tangent conditions\nFor the circle to be externally tangent to $C_1$, the distance between $(a,b)$ and $(0,0)$ must be $r + 1$. Similarly, for the circle to be internally tangent to $C_2$, the distance between $(a,b)$ and $(2,0)$ must be $|r - 4|$.\n\n## Step 4: Write down the equations based on the distance formula\nUsing the distance formula, we have $\\sqrt{(a - 0)^2 + (b - 0)^2} = r + 1$ and $\\sqrt{(a - 2)^2 + (b - 0)^2} = |r - 4|$.\n\n## Step 5: Square both sides of the equations to eliminate the square roots\nSquaring both sides gives $a^2 + b^2 = (r + 1)^2$ and $(a - 2)^2 + b^2 = (r - 4)^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Expand the squared terms\nExpanding the squared terms yields $a^2 + b^2 = r^2 + 2r + 1$ and $a^2 - 4a + 4 + b^2 = r^2 - 8r + 16$.\n\n## Step 7: Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $a^2$ and $b^2$\nSubtracting these equations to eliminate $a^2$ and $b^2$ gives $-4a + 4 = -10r + 15$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $r$ in terms of $a$\nRearranging the equation to solve for $r$ gives $-10r = -4a - 11$, thus $r = \\frac{4a + 11}{10}$.\n\n## Step 9: Substitute $r$ back into one of the original equations to find the relationship between $a$ and $b$\nSubstituting $r = \\frac{4a + 11}{10}$ into $a^2 + b^2 = r^2 + 2r + 1$ gives $a^2 + b^2 = \\left(\\frac{4a + 11}{10}\\right)^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{4a + 11}{10}\\right) + 1$.\n\n## Step 10: Expand and simplify the equation\nExpanding and simplifying, we have $a^2 + b^2 = \\frac{16a^2 + 88a + 121}{100} + \\frac{8a + 22}{10} + 1$.\n\n## Step 11: Further simplify and rearrange the equation\nFurther simplification yields $a^2 + b^2 = \\frac{16a^2 + 88a + 121 + 80a + 220 + 100}{100}$, which simplifies to $a^2 + b^2 = \\frac{16a^2 + 168a + 441}{100}$.\n\n## Step 12: Multiply every term by 100 to clear the denominator and rearrange\nMultiplying by 100 and rearranging gives $100a^2 + 100b^2 = 16a^2 + 168a + 441$, then $100a^2 - 16a^2 + 100b^2 - 168a - 441 = 0$.\n\n## Step 13: Combine like terms to get the final equation\nCombining like terms yields $84a^2 + 100b^2 - 168a - 441 = 0$.\n\n## Step 14: Ensure the equation is in the required format\nThe equation is already in the form $Pa^2 + Qb^2 + Ra + Sb + T = 0$, where $P = 84$, $Q = 100$, $R = -168$, $S = 0$, and $T = -441$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{84a^2 + 100b^2 - 168a - 441 = 0}$"
