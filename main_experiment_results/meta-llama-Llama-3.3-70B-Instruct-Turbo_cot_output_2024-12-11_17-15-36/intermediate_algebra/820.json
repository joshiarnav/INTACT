    "solution": "Since the polynomial has no constant term, we can immediately factor out an $x$ from every term\n$$x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20),$$and our first root $x=0$. Let $g(x) = 6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$. Then the remaining roots of our original polynomial are the roots of $g(x)$. By trying out simple values, we can see that $g(0) = 20 > 0$ and $g(1) = 6+19-51+20 = -6<0$. Thus, there must be a root of $g(x)$ between $0$ and $1$. From the Rational Root Theorem, we know that if $g(p/q) = 0$ then $p$ must divide $20$ and $q$ must divide $6$.\n\nChecking rational numbers of the form $p/q$, where $p$ divides $20$ and $q$ divides $6$, and $p/q$ is between $0$ and $1$, we find that\n$$\\begin{aligned} g\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) &= 6\\cdot\\frac{1}{8}+19\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}-51\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}+20 = 0.\n\\end{aligned}$$This means that $2x - 1$ is a factor of $g(x).$ Dividing by $2x-1$ gives us $g(x) = (2x-1)(3x^2+11x-20)$.\n\nThe quadratic $3x^2+11x-20$ factors as $(3x-4)(x+5),$ so our last two roots are $4/3$ and $-5$.\n\nThus, the roots of $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$ are $\\boxed{0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{4}{3}, -5}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Factor out the greatest common factor\nFirst, let's factor out the greatest common factor, which is $x$. This gives us $x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20)$.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the cubic polynomial\nNow, we need to factor the cubic polynomial $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$. We can try to factor this by finding a rational root. The possible rational roots are $\\pm1$, $\\pm2$, $\\pm4$, $\\pm5$, $\\pm10$, and $\\pm20$. We can use synthetic division or substitution to find the root.\n\n## Step 3: Find a rational root\nUsing synthetic division or substitution, we find that $x=1/2$ is a root of the cubic polynomial $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$. Therefore, we can factor $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$ as $(2x-1)(3x^2+11x-20)$.\n\n## Step 4: Factor the quadratic polynomial\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic polynomial $3x^2+11x-20$. We can factor this as $(3x-4)(x+5)$.\n\n## Step 5: Write the factored form of the polynomial\nCombining the results from the previous steps, we can write the factored form of the polynomial as $x(2x-1)(3x-4)(x+5)$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the roots of the polynomial\nThe roots of the polynomial are the values of $x$ that make the polynomial equal to zero. Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $x=0$, $2x-1=0$, $3x-4=0$, and $x+5=0$. Solving these equations, we get $x=0$, $x=1/2$, $x=4/3$, and $x=-5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0, 1/2, 4/3, -5}$"
