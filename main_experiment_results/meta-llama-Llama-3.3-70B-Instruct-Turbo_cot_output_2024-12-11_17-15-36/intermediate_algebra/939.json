    "solution": "Let $r$ and $s$ be the two common roots.  Then $r$ and $s$ are the roots of\n\\[(x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) - (x^3 + bx^2 + 14 + 8) = (a - b) x^2 - 3x - 2.\\]Note that $r$ and $s$ are also the roots of\n\\begin{align*}\n&4(x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) - 3(x^3 + bx^2 + 14x + 8) \\\\\n&= x^3 + (4a - 3b) x^2 + 2x \\\\\n&= x[x^2 + (4a - 3b) x + 2].\n\\end{align*}Since the constant coefficient of $x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6$ is nonzero, both $r$ and $s$ are non-zero.  Therefore, $r$ and $s$ are the roots of\n\\[x^2 + (4a - 3b) x + 2.\\]Hence, both $r$ and $s$ are the roots of $-x^2 + (3b - 4a) x - 2.$  But $r$ and $s$ are also the roots of $(a - b) x^2 - 3x - 2,$ so the coefficients must match.  This gives us $a - b = -1$ and $3b - 4a = -3.$  Solving, we find $(a,b) = \\boxed{(6,7)}.$\n\nFor these values, the given cubics become\n\\begin{align*}\nx^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6 &= (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3), \\\\\nx^3 + 7x^2 + 14x + 8 &= (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 4).\n\\end{align*}",

Since the two polynomials have two distinct roots in common, we can assume without loss of generality that $r_1 = s_1$ and $r_2 = s_2$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Vieta's formulas\nFrom Vieta's formulas for the first polynomial, we have:\n$r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -a$\n$r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = 11$\n$r_1r_2r_3 = -6$\n\nAnd for the second polynomial:\n$s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = -b$\n$s_1s_2 + s_1s_3 + s_2s_3 = 14$\n$s_1s_2s_3 = -8$\n\n## Step 4: Use the common roots to relate the coefficients\nSince $r_1 = s_1$ and $r_2 = s_2$, we can write:\n$r_1r_2 = s_1s_2$\n$r_1r_2(r_3 + s_3) = -6 - (-8)$\n$r_1r_2(r_3 + s_3) = 2$\n\n## Step 5: Express $r_3 + s_3$ using Vieta's formulas\nFrom Vieta's formulas, we have:\n$r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -a$\n$s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = -b$\nSubtracting these equations gives:\n$r_3 - s_3 = b - a$\n\n## Step 6: Find the relationship between $r_3$ and $s_3$\nWe also know that:\n$r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = 11$\n$s_1s_2 + s_1s_3 + s_2s_3 = 14$\nSubtracting these equations and using $r_1 = s_1$ and $r_2 = s_2$, we get:\n$r_1r_2(r_3 - s_3) = 3$\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $r_1r_2$\nFrom Step 6, we have:\n$r_1r_2(r_3 - s_3) = 3$\nAnd from Step 4, we have:\n$r_1r_2(r_3 + s_3) = 2$\nDividing these two equations, we get:\n$\\frac{r_3 - s_3}{r_3 + s_3} = \\frac{3}{2}$\n\n## Step 8: Solve for $r_3$ and $s_3$\nFrom Step 7, we can express $r_3$ in terms of $s_3$:\n$r_3 = \\frac{5}{3}s_3$\nSubstituting $r_3 = \\frac{5}{3}s_3$ into $r_1r_2(r_3 + s_3) = 2$, we get:\n$r_1r_2(\\frac{8}{3}s_3) = 2$\n\n## Step 9: Use Vieta's formulas to find $r_1r_2$\nSince $r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = 11$ and $s_1s_2 + s_1s_3 + s_2s_3 = 14$, and $r_1 = s_1$, $r_2 = s_2$, we have:\n$r_1r_2 + r_1(\\frac{5}{3}s_3) + r_2(\\frac{5}{3}s_3) = 11$\n$r_1r_2 + r_1s_3 + r_2s_3 = 14$\nSubtracting these equations, we get:\n$-\\frac{2}{3}(r_1 + r_2)s_3 = -3$\nSince $r_1 + r_2 = s_1 + s_2 = -b + s_3$, we have:\n$-\\frac{2}{3}(-b + s_3)s_3 = -3$\n\n## Step 10: Solve the system of equations\nUsing the fact that $r_1 = s_1$ and $r_2 = s_2$, we have:\n$r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -a$\n$s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = -b$\nSubtracting these equations gives:\n$r_3 - s_3 = b - a$\nFrom Step 5, we have:\n$r_3 - s_3 = b - a$\nAnd from Step 4, we have:\n$r_1r_2(r_3 + s_3) = 2$\nUsing the relationship between $r_3$ and $s_3$ from Step 8, we can solve for $r_1r_2$.\n\n## Step 11: Solve for $a$ and $b$\nUsing the relationships derived in the previous steps, we can set up a system of equations to solve for $a$ and $b$.\nFrom Vieta's formulas, we have:\n$r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -a$\n$s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = -b$\nSince $r_1 = s_1$ and $r_2 = s_2$, we can write:\n$r_3 - s_3 = b - a$\nUsing the fact that $r_1r_2(r_3 + s_3) = 2$ and $r_1r_2(r_3 - s_3) = 3$, we can solve for $r_3$ and $s_3$.\nSubstituting $r_3 = \\frac{5}{3}s_3$ into $r_1r_2(r_3 + s_3) = 2$, we get:\n$r_1r_2(\\frac{8}{3}s_3) = 2$\nSolving this equation, we can find $r_1r_2$.\nUsing the fact that $r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = 11$ and $s_1s_2 + s_1s_3 + s_2s_3 = 14$, we can solve for $r_3$ and $s_3$.\nSubstituting $r_3 = \\frac{5}{3}s_3$ into $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -a$, we get:\n$s_1 + s_2 + \\frac{5}{3}s_3 = -a$\nUsing the fact that $s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = -b$, we can solve for $a$ and $b$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(3,4)}$"
