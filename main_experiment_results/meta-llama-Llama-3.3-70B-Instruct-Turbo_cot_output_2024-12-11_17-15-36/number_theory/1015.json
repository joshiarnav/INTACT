    "problem": "If the seven-digit number $854n526$ is divisible by $11$, what is $n$?",
    "solution": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$.",

    "model_solution": "To determine if the seven-digit number $854n526$ is divisible by $11$, we can use the divisibility rule for $11$, which states that the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions (units, hundreds, ten-thousands, etc.) and the sum of the digits in the even positions (tens, thousands, hundred-thousands, etc.) must be divisible by $11$.\n\nLet's break down the number $854n526$ into its individual digits and identify their positions:\n\n- $8$ is in the 1st (odd) position\n- $5$ is in the 2nd (even) position\n- $4$ is in the 3rd (odd) position\n- $n$ is in the 4th (even) position\n- $5$ is in the 5th (odd) position\n- $2$ is in the 6th (even) position\n- $6$ is in the 7th (odd) position\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions:\n\nSum of digits in odd positions = $8 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 23$\nSum of digits in even positions = $5 + n + 2 = 7 + n$\n\nAccording to the divisibility rule for $11$, the difference between these two sums must be divisible by $11$. So, we set up the equation:\n\n$23 - (7 + n) = 16 - n$\n\nThis difference must be divisible by $11$. Let's find the value of $n$ that satisfies this condition:\n\n$16 - n$ must be divisible by $11$\n\nThe possible values for $16 - n$ that are divisible by $11$ are $0, 11, -11$. Since $n$ is a single digit, $16 - n$ cannot be $-11$ (because $n$ would have to be $27$, which is not a single digit). \n\nIf $16 - n = 0$, then $n = 16$, which is not possible since $n$ must be a single digit.\n\nIf $16 - n = 11$, then $n = 5$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $n$ that makes $854n526$ divisible by $11$ is $5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
