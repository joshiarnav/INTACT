    "problem": "Convert $199_{10}$ to base 2. Let $x$ be the number of zeros and $y$ be the number of ones in base 2. What is the value of $y-x?$",
    "solution": "The largest power of 2 that divides $199$ is $2^7$, which equals 128. Since $(1\\cdot 2^7)=128<199<(2\\cdot 2^7)=256$, the digit in the $2^7$ place is $1$. We know that $199-128=71$, and that $71$ can be expressed as $64+4+2+1$, or $(1\\cdot 2^6)+(1\\cdot 2^2)+(1\\cdot 2^1)+(1\\cdot 2^0)$. This means that $199_{10}=11000111_2$. Therefore, $x=3$ and $y=5$; and $y-x=5-3=\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to convert the decimal number $199_{10}$ to binary (base 2) and then find the difference between the count of ones and zeros in the binary representation.\n\n## Step 2: Convert $199_{10}$ to base 2\nTo convert $199_{10}$ to base 2, we will continuously divide the number by 2 and record the remainder until the quotient becomes 0. The remainders, read from bottom to top, will give us the binary representation.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the conversion\nStart dividing $199_{10}$ by 2:\n- $199 \\div 2 = 99$ remainder 1\n- $99 \\div 2 = 49$ remainder 1\n- $49 \\div 2 = 24$ remainder 1\n- $24 \\div 2 = 12$ remainder 0\n- $12 \\div 2 = 6$ remainder 0\n- $6 \\div 2 = 3$ remainder 0\n- $3 \\div 2 = 1$ remainder 1\n- $1 \\div 2 = 0$ remainder 1\n\n## Step 4: Determine the binary representation\nReading the remainders from bottom to top, $199_{10}$ in base 2 is $11000111_2$.\n\n## Step 5: Count the zeros and ones\nIn $11000111_2$, the number of zeros ($x$) is 3 and the number of ones ($y$) is 5.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $y - x$\n$y - x = 5 - 3 = 2$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
