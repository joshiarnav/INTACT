    "problem": "What is the digit in the tens place when $7^{2005}$ is expressed in decimal notation?",
    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of the last two digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $07, 49, 43, 01, 07, 49, 43, 01,\\ldots$ . The cycle of the last two digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 numbers long: 07, 49, 43, 01. Thus, to find the tens digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=0$ or 1 corresponds to the tens digit 0, and $R=2$ or 3 corresponds to the units digit 4). Since $2005\\div4=501R1$, the tens digit of $7^{2005}$ is $ \\boxed{0}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the problem and the goal\nWe need to find the digit in the tens place when $7^{2005}$ is expressed in decimal notation.\n\n## Step 2: Look for a pattern in powers of 7\nLet's calculate the first few powers of 7 to see if there's a pattern: $7^1 = 7$, $7^2 = 49$, $7^3 = 343$, $7^4 = 2401$, $7^5 = 16807$, $7^6 = 117649$, $7^7 = 823543$, $7^8 = 5764801$. We notice that the last two digits of powers of 7 seem to follow a pattern.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the pattern for the last two digits of powers of 7\nFrom the calculations, we observe the last two digits of $7^n$ follow a pattern: $07, 49, 43, 01, 07, 49, 43, 01, ...$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ...$. This pattern repeats every 4 powers.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the pattern to $7^{2005}$\nSince the pattern repeats every 4 powers, we divide 2005 by 4 and look at the remainder. $2005 \\div 4 = 501$ remainder $1$. This means $7^{2005}$ will have the same last two digits as $7^1$, which is $07$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the tens digit\nGiven that the last two digits of $7^{2005}$ are $07$, the tens digit is $0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"
