    "problem": "When an integer is divided by 15, the remainder is 7. Find the sum of the remainders when the same integer is divided by 3 and by 5.",
    "solution": "We let our integer be $n$.  the first sentence tells us that  \\[n\\equiv 7\\pmod {15}.\\] Since 3 and 5 are both factors of 15 we deduce \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv2\\pmod5.\n\\end{align*} Therefore the remainders in question are 1 and 2, and their sum is $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the initial condition**: We know that when an integer (let's call it $n$) is divided by 15, the remainder is 7. This can be written as $n = 15q + 7$, where $q$ is the quotient of the division.\n\n2. **Division by 3**: Now, we need to find the remainder when $n$ is divided by 3. Given $n = 15q + 7$, let's consider how $15q + 7$ behaves when divided by 3. Since $15q$ is always divisible by 3 (because 15 is divisible by 3), we only need to consider the remainder when 7 is divided by 3. When 7 is divided by 3, the remainder is 1.\n\n3. **Division by 5**: Next, we find the remainder when $n$ is divided by 5. Again, considering $n = 15q + 7$, since $15q$ is always divisible by 5 (because 15 is divisible by 5), we look at the remainder when 7 is divided by 5. When 7 is divided by 5, the remainder is 2.\n\n4. **Sum of the remainders**: Finally, we add the remainders from the divisions by 3 and by 5. So, $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the remainders when the same integer is divided by 3 and by 5 is $\\boxed{3}$."
