    "problem": "The American Mathematics College is holding its orientation for incoming freshmen. The incoming freshman class contains fewer than $500$ people. When the freshmen are told to line up in columns of $23$, $22$ people are in the last column. When the freshmen are told to line up in columns of $21$, $14$ people are in the last column. How many people are in the incoming freshman class?",
    "solution": "If $n$ is the number of people in the incoming class, then $n$ yields a remainder of $14$ when divided by $21$. Since both 21 and 14 are divisible by 7, this means that $n$ is divisible by $7$. Define $k=n/7$, and note that $7k \\equiv 14\\pmod{21}$. Dividing by 7, we get $k\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. Multiplying by 7 again, we get $n\\equiv 14\\pmod{3}$, which implies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. So we are looking for a solution to the following system of linear congruences: \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}, \\\\\nn&\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3},\\\\\nn&\\equiv 22 \\pmod{23}. \\\\\n\\end{align*} First, we look for a solution to the last two congruences. Checking numbers that are one less than a multiple of 23, we find that 68 satisfies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $n$ which satisfy both of the last two congruences are precisely those that differ from 68 by a multiple of $3\\cdot 23=69$. Checking $68+69$, $68+2\\cdot 69$, etc. we find that $68 + 5\\cdot 69 = \\boxed{413}$ is the least positive solution to the last two congruences which is also divisible by 7. Note that, by the Chinese remainder theorem again, the solutions of the above system of three congruences are precisely the positive integers that differ from 413 by a multiple of $7\\cdot3\\cdot23=483,$ so 413 is indeed the only solution between 0 and 500.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the key pieces of information.\nWe are given two conditions based on the number of people in the incoming freshman class. Let's denote the total number of people as $N$. The conditions are: when divided by $23$, the remainder is $22$, and when divided by $21$, the remainder is $14$.\n\n## Step 2: Express the conditions using mathematical equations.\nFrom the first condition, we have $N = 23a + 22$, where $a$ is an integer representing the number of full columns when the freshmen line up in columns of $23$.\nFrom the second condition, we have $N = 21b + 14$, where $b$ is an integer representing the number of full columns when the freshmen line up in columns of $21$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) or simple substitution to find a relationship between $a$ and $b$ that satisfies both equations.\nSetting the two equations equal to each other gives $23a + 22 = 21b + 14$. Simplifying, we get $23a - 21b = -8$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the linear Diophantine equation $23a - 21b = -8$ for integers $a$ and $b$.\nTo solve this, we can use either substitution, elimination, or find a particular solution and then the general solution. A particular solution can be found by inspection or systematically. Let's find a particular solution.\n\n## Step 5: Finding a particular solution.\nBy trial and error or using the Euclidean algorithm, we can find a particular solution. One way to simplify the search for a solution is to look for patterns or use the Euclidean algorithm to find the gcd of $23$ and $21$, which is $1$, indicating there are solutions.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the Euclidean algorithm to find a solution.\n$23 = 1 \\times 21 + 2$, $21 = 10 \\times 2 + 1$, $2 = 2 \\times 1 + 0$. Working backward to express $1$ as a combination of $23$ and $21$: $1 = 21 - 10 \\times 2 = 21 - 10 \\times (23 - 21) = 11 \\times 21 - 10 \\times 23$. Thus, $1 = 11 \\times 21 - 10 \\times 23$. To get $-8$, we multiply both sides by $-8$: $-8 = -88 \\times 21 + 80 \\times 23$. So, a particular solution is $a = 80$, $b = -88$.\n\n## Step 7: General solution for $a$ and $b$.\nThe general solution for $a$ and $b$ is given by $a = a' + 21n$, $b = b' + 23n$, where $a'$ and $b'$ are particular solutions, and $n$ is any integer. Substituting $a' = 80$ and $b' = -88$, we get $a = 80 + 21n$, $b = -88 + 23n$.\n\n## Step 8: Substitute $a$ or $b$ back into one of the original equations to find $N$.\nUsing $N = 23a + 22$ and $a = 80 + 21n$, we substitute to get $N = 23(80 + 21n) + 22 = 1840 + 483n + 22 = 1862 + 483n$.\n\n## Step 9: Apply the constraint that $N < 500$ to find a suitable $n$.\nGiven $N < 500$, we have $1862 + 483n < 500$. Solving for $n$, $483n < -1362$. Dividing by $483$, $n < -2.82$. Since $n$ must be an integer, the largest possible integer value for $n$ that satisfies the inequality is $n = -3$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate $N$ using $n = -3$.\nSubstituting $n = -3$ into $N = 1862 + 483n$, we get $N = 1862 + 483 \\times (-3) = 1862 - 1449 = 413$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{413}$"
