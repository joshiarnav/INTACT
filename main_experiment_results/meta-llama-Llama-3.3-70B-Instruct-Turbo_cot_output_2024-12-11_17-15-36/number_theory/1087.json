    "problem": "What is the $100$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{3}{26}$ is expressed as a decimal?",
    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block. We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$. Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Convert the fraction to a decimal\nTo find the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{26}$, we perform long division. The result of $\\frac{3}{26}$ as a decimal is $0.115384615384...$ where the sequence $615384$ repeats.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the repeating sequence\nThe repeating sequence in the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{26}$ is $615384$. This sequence has $6$ digits.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the position of the 100th digit\nSince the sequence repeats every $6$ digits, we need to find where the $100$th digit falls within this sequence. We do this by finding the remainder when $100$ is divided by $6$, which is $4$. This means the $100$th digit is the same as the $4$th digit in the repeating sequence.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the 4th digit in the repeating sequence\nThe repeating sequence is $615384$. The $4$th digit in this sequence is $3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
