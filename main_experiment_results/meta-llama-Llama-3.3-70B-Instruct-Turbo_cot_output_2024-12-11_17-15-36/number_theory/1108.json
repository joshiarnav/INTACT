    "solution": "In the rightmost column there is no carrying, so our base must be greater than 5. However, in the next column we see that $6_{b}+3_{b}=11_{b}$. This tells us that $b$ divides into 9 once, with a remainder 1. Therefore, $b=\\boxed{8}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given equation\nThe equation given is $161_{b}+134_{b}=315_{b}$. This equation represents the addition of two numbers in base $b$, resulting in a third number also in base $b$.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the numbers to the base 10 system for easier calculation\nTo solve for $b$, it's helpful to convert these numbers into the base 10 system. The base 10 value of $161_{b}$ is $1 \\cdot b^2 + 6 \\cdot b^1 + 1 \\cdot b^0$. Similarly, the base 10 value of $134_{b}$ is $1 \\cdot b^2 + 3 \\cdot b^1 + 4 \\cdot b^0$, and the base 10 value of $315_{b}$ is $3 \\cdot b^2 + 1 \\cdot b^1 + 5 \\cdot b^0$.\n\n## Step 3: Write the equation in base 10\nSubstituting the base 10 representations back into the original equation gives $(1 \\cdot b^2 + 6 \\cdot b^1 + 1 \\cdot b^0) + (1 \\cdot b^2 + 3 \\cdot b^1 + 4 \\cdot b^0) = (3 \\cdot b^2 + 1 \\cdot b^1 + 5 \\cdot b^0)$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation\nCombine like terms: $2b^2 + 9b + 5 = 3b^2 + b + 5$. Move all terms to one side to get $0 = b^2 - 8b$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for b\nFactor out $b$: $0 = b(b - 8)$. This gives two possible solutions: $b = 0$ or $b = 8$. However, $b = 0$ is not a valid base for a number system in this context, as it would not allow for the representation of numbers. Thus, $b = 8$ is the solution.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
