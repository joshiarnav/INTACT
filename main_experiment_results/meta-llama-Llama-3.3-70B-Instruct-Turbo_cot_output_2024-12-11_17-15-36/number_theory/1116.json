    "problem": "What is the sum of all integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer?",
    "solution": "The expression $2n-1$ is odd for every integer $n$, and conversely every odd integer takes the form $2n-1$ for some integer $n$.  Therefore, there is one solution $n$ for each (not necessarily positive) odd divisor of 20.  The positive odd divisors of 20 are 1 and 5, so we solve $2n-1=-5$, $2n-1=-1$, $2n-1=1$, and $2n-1=5$ to find the solutions $n=-2$, $n=0$, $n=1$, and $n=3$.  These values for $n$ sum to $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the conditions for $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ to be an integer\nFor $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ to be an integer, $2n - 1$ must be a divisor of 20. Since $2n - 1$ is odd, we only need to consider the odd divisors of 20.\n\n## Step 2: List all the divisors of 20\nThe divisors of 20 are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm5, \\pm10, \\pm20$. We are only interested in the odd divisors, which are $\\pm1, \\pm5$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $n$ using each odd divisor\nWe will solve for $n$ in the equation $2n - 1 = \\pm1$ and $2n - 1 = \\pm5$.\n- For $2n - 1 = 1$, we have $2n = 2$, so $n = 1$.\n- For $2n - 1 = -1$, we have $2n = 0$, so $n = 0$.\n- For $2n - 1 = 5$, we have $2n = 6$, so $n = 3$.\n- For $2n - 1 = -5$, we have $2n = -4$, so $n = -2$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of all integer values of $n$\nSum of $n = 1 + 0 + 3 - 2 = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
