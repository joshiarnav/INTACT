    "solution": "To find the least common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, we ignore 1 and prime factorize the rest to obtain $2, 3, 2^2, 5, 2\\cdot 3, 7, 2^3$, and $3^2$. Taking the maximum exponent for each prime, we find that the least common multiple is $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{2520}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nTo find the smallest number divisible by integers 1 through 9, we need to consider the concept of the least common multiple (LCM), as this number must be divisible by all integers from 1 to 9 without leaving a remainder.\n\n## Step 2: List the numbers 1 through 9\nThe numbers we are considering are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the prime factors of each number\nBreaking down each number into its prime factors will help us find the LCM.\n- 1 has no prime factors.\n- 2 = 2\n- 3 = 3\n- 4 = 2^2\n- 5 = 5\n- 6 = 2 * 3\n- 7 = 7\n- 8 = 2^3\n- 9 = 3^2\n\n## Step 4: Identify the highest power of each prime factor\nTo calculate the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number found in the factorizations.\n- The highest power of 2 is 2^3 (from 8).\n- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9).\n- The highest power of 5 is 5 (from 5).\n- The highest power of 7 is 7 (from 7).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the LCM\nTo find the LCM, we multiply these highest powers together: 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 7.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the multiplication\nCalculating the product: 2^3 = 8, 3^2 = 9, so 8 * 9 * 5 * 7 = 72 * 5 * 7 = 360 * 7 = 2520.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2520}$"
