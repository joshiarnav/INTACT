    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the range of two-digit multiples of 7.\nThe smallest two-digit multiple of 7 is 14, and the largest is 98.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of terms in the sequence.\nTo find the number of terms, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the last term (98 in this case), $a_1$ is the first term (14), $n$ is the number of terms, and $d$ is the common difference (7 for multiples of 7). So, $98 = 14 + (n-1)7$. Simplifying, $84 = (n-1)7$. Solving for $n$, $n-1 = 12$, thus $n = 13$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the sum of the arithmetic series.\nThe sum $S_n$ of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term. Substituting the known values: $S_{13} = \\frac{13}{2}(14 + 98)$.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the arithmetic to find the sum.\n$S_{13} = \\frac{13}{2}(112) = \\frac{13 \\times 112}{2} = \\frac{1456}{2} = 728$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the arithmetic mean.\nThe arithmetic mean is the sum of the terms divided by the number of terms. So, the mean is $728 / 13$.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the division to find the mean.\n$728 / 13 = 56$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{56}$"
