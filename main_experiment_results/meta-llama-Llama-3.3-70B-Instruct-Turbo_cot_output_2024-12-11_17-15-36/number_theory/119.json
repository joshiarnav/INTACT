    "problem": "In a physical education class, students line up in four rows to do exercises. One particular class has over 30 students, with three rows having the same number of students and one row having one more student than the other three rows. What is the smallest possible class size for this physical education class?",
    "solution": "If the first three rows have 1 student, the last row must have two students, so there are 5 students in total. This is not greater than 30, so we must add another student to each row. This gives 9, which is still not greater than 30. We have to keep adding 4 until we get to a number greater than 30. As a result, we reach 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33. 33 is the first integer greater than 30, so this class has $\\boxed{33}$ students.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the smallest possible class size where students line up in four rows, with three rows having the same number of students and one row having one more student than the other three.\n\n## Step 2: Define the variables\nLet's denote the number of students in each of the three equal rows as x. The row with one more student will then have x + 1 students.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate the equation for the total number of students\nThe total number of students (T) can be represented as the sum of the students in all four rows: T = x + x + x + (x + 1).\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation from Step 3, we get T = 3x + (x + 1) = 4x + 1.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the constraints\nWe know that the total number of students is over 30. So, we need to find the smallest value of x that satisfies the equation T = 4x + 1 and results in T being greater than 30.\n\n## Step 6: Find the minimum value of x that satisfies the condition\nTo find the minimum class size over 30, we start by testing the smallest possible values for x. Since T = 4x + 1, we can start with x = 1, 2, 3, and so on, until we get a T greater than 30.\n\n## Step 7: Test values of x\nStarting with x = 1, we get T = 4*1 + 1 = 5, which is less than 30.\nFor x = 2, T = 4*2 + 1 = 9, still less than 30.\nFor x = 3, T = 4*3 + 1 = 13, less than 30.\nFor x = 4, T = 4*4 + 1 = 17, less than 30.\nFor x = 5, T = 4*5 + 1 = 21, less than 30.\nFor x = 6, T = 4*6 + 1 = 25, less than 30.\nFor x = 7, T = 4*7 + 1 = 29, still less than 30.\nFor x = 8, T = 4*8 + 1 = 33, which is greater than 30.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the smallest class size\nThe smallest possible class size that meets the criteria is when x = 8, resulting in a total of 33 students.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{33}$"
