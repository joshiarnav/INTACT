    "solution": "Adding the first digits, we get $8$, hence $2$ after carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, again with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $2$, with carrying. Finally, adding $1$ to one, we get $2$. Thus our final answer is $\\boxed{22112_6}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Convert the numbers to base 10\nFirst, we need to convert the given numbers from base 6 to base 10 to make the addition easier. The first number is $2343_6$, which can be converted as follows: $2*6^3 + 3*6^2 + 4*6^1 + 3*6^0$. Calculating this gives: $2*216 + 3*36 + 4*6 + 3*1 = 432 + 108 + 24 + 3 = 567$.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the second number to base 10\nThe second number is $15325_6$. Converting it to base 10: $1*6^4 + 5*6^3 + 3*6^2 + 2*6^1 + 5*6^0$. Calculating this gives: $1*1296 + 5*216 + 3*36 + 2*6 + 5*1 = 1296 + 1080 + 108 + 12 + 5 = 2501$.\n\n## Step 3: Add the two numbers in base 10\nNow, we add the two base 10 numbers: $567 + 2501 = 3068$.\n\n## Step 4: Convert the sum back to base 6\nTo convert $3068$ back to base 6, we divide by 6 and keep track of the remainders.\n- $3068 / 6 = 511$ remainder $2$.\n- $511 / 6 = 85$ remainder $1$.\n- $85 / 6 = 14$ remainder $1$.\n- $14 / 6 = 2$ remainder $2$.\n- $2 / 6 = 0$ remainder $2$.\nSo, the base 6 representation is $22112_6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{221126}$"
