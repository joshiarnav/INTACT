    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the divisibility rule for 9\nA number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. This means that for the number $D\\,767\\,E89$ to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits, $D + 7 + 6 + 7 + E + 8 + 9$, must be divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the sum of known digits\nThe sum of the known digits in the number is $7 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 37$.\n\n## Step 3: Express the condition for divisibility by 9\nFor $D\\,767\\,E89$ to be divisible by 9, $D + E + 37$ must be divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the range of possible values for D + E\nSince $D$ and $E$ are each a single digit, the minimum value of $D + E$ is 0 (if both $D$ and $E$ were 0, which is not possible in a multi-digit number but we consider the theoretical minimum for calculation purposes) and the maximum value is 18 (if both $D$ and $E$ were 9). However, since $D$ cannot be 0 (as it is the leading digit), the practical minimum for $D + E$ is 1 (if $D$ is 1 and $E$ is 0).\n\n## Step 5: Find the values of D + E that make D + E + 37 divisible by 9\nTo make $D + E + 37$ divisible by 9, the possible sums of $D + E + 37$ that are divisible by 9 and fall within the range of possible digit sums are 45 (since $D + E$ could be 8) and 54 (since $D + E$ could be 17), considering the sum $D + E + 37$. We need to find which values of $D + E$ satisfy this condition.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the specific values of D + E that satisfy the divisibility condition\n- For $D + E + 37 = 45$, $D + E = 45 - 37 = 8$.\n- For $D + E + 37 = 54$, $D + E = 54 - 37 = 17$.\nThese are the possible sums of $D + E$ that make the entire number divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 7: Sum all possible values of D + E\nThe possible values for $D + E$ are 8 and 17. Summing these values gives $8 + 17 = 25$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{25}$"
