    "problem": "A divisor of a number is a proper divisor if it is not equal to the number. What is the sum of the proper divisors of $432$?",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $432 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^3$. It follows that the sum of the divisors is equal to $(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4)(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3)$, as each factor of $432$ is represented when the product is expanded. We have to subtract $432$ so that we only count the proper divisors, so the answer is \\begin{align*}\n(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16)(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) - 432 &= (31)(40) - 432\\\\\n&= 1240 - 432\\\\\n&= \\boxed{808}.\\\\\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Find the prime factorization of 432\nTo find the sum of the proper divisors of 432, we first need to find its prime factorization. The prime factorization of 432 is $2^4 \\cdot 3^3$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the sum of all divisors\nThe sum of all divisors, including the number itself, can be calculated using the formula $(1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + ... + p_1^{a_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + ... + p_2^{a_2})$, where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the prime factors and $a_1$ and $a_2$ are their respective powers. For $432 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^3$, the sum of all divisors is $(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4)(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3)$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the sum of the divisors for the prime factor 2\nThe sum of the divisors for the prime factor 2 is $1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of the divisors for the prime factor 3\nThe sum of the divisors for the prime factor 3 is $1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the sum of all divisors\nThe sum of all divisors is the product of the sums calculated in steps 3 and 4, which is $31 \\cdot 40 = 1240$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the sum of the proper divisors\nThe sum of the proper divisors is the sum of all divisors minus the number itself, which is $1240 - 432 = 808$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{808}$"
