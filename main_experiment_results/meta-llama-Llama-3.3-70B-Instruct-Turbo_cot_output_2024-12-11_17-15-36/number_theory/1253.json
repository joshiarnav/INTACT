    "problem": "What is the largest number, with its digits all different, whose digits add up to 16?",
    "solution": "For a number to be as large as possible, we want as many places (digits) as possible. To allow for as many digits as possible, we want the digits to be small so that there will be more digits that add up to $16$. We start with the smallest number, $0$ and keep adding the next number. $0+1+2+3+4=10$. However, we cannot add $5$, because then we are left with $16-10-5=1$, and we already have the number $1$. Therefore, the next number to be added would be $16-10=6$.\nNow, we have the numbers $0,1,2,3,4,6$ to form a number. We want the larger places to have larger numbers. Therefore, we order the numbers in decreasing order to form the number $\\boxed{643210}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the largest number with all different digits, whose sum of digits equals 16. This means we have to maximize the value of the number while ensuring that no digit is repeated and the sum of the digits is exactly 16.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the maximum number of digits\nTo maximize the number, we should use as many digits as possible, starting from the smallest. Since the digits must add up to 16 and be different, we start with 0 and continue adding the next smallest digits until we reach or exceed 16.\n\n## Step 3: Try to sum digits to 16 starting from 0\nStarting with 0, the next digits to add would be 1, 2, 3, and so on, until we reach or get as close as possible to 16 without exceeding it. The sum of 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 is less than 16. Adding the next digit, 5, gives us 10 + 5 = 15, which is still less than 16. Adding the next digit, 6, gives us 15 + 6 = 21, which exceeds 16.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the optimal set of digits\nSince adding 6 exceeds 16, we look for the next best combination that includes higher digits but still sums up to 16. We see that 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 10 = 16, but since we cannot use 10 as a single digit, we consider the next best option. The combination 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 is viable and uses different digits.\n\n## Step 5: Arrange the digits to form the largest possible number\nTo form the largest possible number, we arrange the digits from largest to smallest, ensuring that the largest digits occupy the most significant positions. Thus, the arrangement of 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 from largest to smallest gives us the number 643210.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{643210}$"
