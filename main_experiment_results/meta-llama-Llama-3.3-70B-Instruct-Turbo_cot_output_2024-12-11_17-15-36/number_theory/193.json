    "solution": "We start by testing palindromic sequences in base 4. Since the positive integer must be greater than 5, we start by analyzing $22_4$, which is $1010_2$. We then test $33_4$, which is $1111_2$. Converting to base 10, we have $33_4 = 3(4) + 3 = \\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand what a palindrome is\nA palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward. In the context of numbers, this means the number remains the same when its digits are reversed, regardless of the base.\n\n## Step 2: Convert numbers greater than 5 to base 2 and base 4 to find palindromes\nStarting with 6, we convert each number to base 2 and base 4 and check for palindromes.\n\n## Step 3: Check the number 6\nIn base 2, 6 is 110, which is not a palindrome. In base 4, 6 is 12, which is also not a palindrome.\n\n## Step 4: Check the number 7\nIn base 2, 7 is 111, which is a palindrome. In base 4, 7 is 13, which is not a palindrome.\n\n## Step 5: Check the number 8\nIn base 2, 8 is 1000, which is not a palindrome. In base 4, 8 is 20, which is not a palindrome.\n\n## Step 6: Check the number 9\nIn base 2, 9 is 1001, which is a palindrome. In base 4, 9 is 21, which is not a palindrome.\n\n## Step 7: Check the number 10\nIn base 2, 10 is 1010, which is not a palindrome. In base 4, 10 is 22, which is a palindrome.\n\n## Step 8: Check the number 11\nIn base 2, 11 is 1011, which is a palindrome. In base 4, 11 is 23, which is not a palindrome.\n\n## Step 9: Check the number 12\nIn base 2, 12 is 1100, which is not a palindrome. In base 4, 12 is 30, which is not a palindrome.\n\n## Step 10: Check the number 13\nIn base 2, 13 is 1101, which is not a palindrome. In base 4, 13 is 31, which is not a palindrome.\n\n## Step 11: Check the number 14\nIn base 2, 14 is 1110, which is not a palindrome. In base 4, 14 is 32, which is not a palindrome.\n\n## Step 12: Check the number 15\nIn base 2, 15 is 1111, which is a palindrome. In base 4, 15 is 33, which is a palindrome.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
