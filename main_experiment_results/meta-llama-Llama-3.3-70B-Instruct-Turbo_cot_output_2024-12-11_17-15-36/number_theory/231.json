    "problem": "Find the number of odd digits in the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$.",
    "solution": "We begin by converting $233_{10}$ into base-4. Since $4^3=64$ is the largest power of 4 that is less than 233, and $3\\cdot64=192$ is the largest multiple of 64 that is less than 233, the coefficient of the $4^3$ term will be 3. From here, we are left with a remainder of $233-192=41$. The largest power of 4 that is less than this number is $4^2=16$, and the largest multiple of 16 that is less than 41 is $2\\cdot16=32$. This leaves us with $41-32=9$, which we can express as $2\\cdot4^1+1\\cdot4^0$. So, we find that $233_{10}=3\\cdot4^3+2\\cdot4^2+2\\cdot{4^1}+1\\cdot4^0=3221_4$, which has $\\boxed{2}$ odd digits.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Convert the decimal number 233 to base 4\nTo find the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$, we start by dividing 233 by 4 and noting the remainder. We continue this process with the quotient until we reach 0.\n\n## Step 2: Perform the division steps\n- $233 \\div 4 = 58$ remainder 1\n- $58 \\div 4 = 14$ remainder 2\n- $14 \\div 4 = 3$ remainder 2\n- $3 \\div 4 = 0$ remainder 3\n\n## Step 3: Write down the base-4 representation\nThe base-4 representation of $233_{10}$ is $3221_4$, reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the odd digits in base 4\nIn base 4, the odd digits are 1 and 3.\n\n## Step 5: Count the number of odd digits\nIn $3221_4$, the odd digits are 3 and 1. So, there are 2 odd digits.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
