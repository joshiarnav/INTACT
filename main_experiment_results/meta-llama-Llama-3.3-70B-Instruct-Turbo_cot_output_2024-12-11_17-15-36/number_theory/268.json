    "problem": "What is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$?",
    "solution": "Observing that $4 \\cdot 7 = 28 = 27 + 1,$ we multiply both sides of the given congruence by 7 to find $28x \\equiv 91 \\pmod{27}$. Since $28x\\equiv x\\pmod{27}$ and $91\\equiv10 \\pmod{27}$, we conclude that $x\\equiv 10\\pmod{27}$. Therefore, $\\boxed{10}$ is the smallest positive integer satisfying the given congruence.",

    "model_solution": "To solve the congruence \\(4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}\\), we need to find the smallest positive integer \\(x\\) that satisfies this equation.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the problem and the goal\nWe are given the congruence \\(4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}\\), which means that when \\(4x\\) is divided by 27, the remainder is 13. Our goal is to find the smallest positive integer \\(x\\) that satisfies this condition.\n\n## Step 2: Find the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27\nTo solve the congruence, we first need to find the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27. The multiplicative inverse of \\(a\\) modulo \\(m\\) is an integer \\(b\\) such that \\(ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}\\). For 4 modulo 27, we are looking for a number \\(b\\) such that \\(4b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}\\).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the multiplicative inverse\nTo find the inverse of 4 modulo 27, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or simply check multiples of 4 to see which one leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 27. However, a quicker method for small numbers is to look for a multiple of 4 that is 1 more than a multiple of 27. Since 27 * 1 + 1 = 28, and 28 is not a multiple of 4, we continue. Noting that 4 * 7 = 28, which is 1 more than 27, we have \\(4 * 7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}\\), meaning 7 is the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the multiplicative inverse to solve the congruence\nNow that we have the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27 as 7, we can multiply both sides of the congruence \\(4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}\\) by 7 to solve for \\(x\\). This gives us \\(7 * 4x \\equiv 7 * 13 \\pmod{27}\\), simplifying to \\(x \\equiv 91 \\pmod{27}\\).\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the result to find the smallest positive integer\nSince \\(x \\equiv 91 \\pmod{27}\\), we need to find the remainder when 91 is divided by 27 to get the smallest positive integer \\(x\\). Dividing 91 by 27 gives a quotient of 3 with a remainder of 10. Thus, \\(x \\equiv 10 \\pmod{27}\\), meaning the smallest positive integer \\(x\\) that satisfies the original congruence is 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
