    "problem": "When $555_{10}$ is expressed in this base, it has 4 digits, in the form ABAB, where A and B are two different digits.  What base is it?",
    "solution": "First, let us find which bases result in $555_{10}$ having four digits. We must find base b such that $b^{4}>555_{10}\\geq b^{3}$. We easily determine that b can range from 5 to 8, inclusive.  We can now try each of these four bases to see which yields a number in the form ABAB.  For base six, we find that $6^{3}=216$, which can go into 555 only two times at most, leaving $555-2\\cdot216 = 123$ for the next three digits. $6^{2}=36$ goes into 123 three times at most, leaving us with $123-3\\cdot36 = 15$. Then, $6^{1}=6$ goes into 15 two times at most, leaving $15-2\\cdot6 = 3$ for the ones digit. So, the base $\\boxed{6}$ equivalent of $555_{10}$ is $2323_{6}$, which satisfies all of the requirements stated.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the range of bases for a 4-digit number\nTo have a 4-digit number in base $b$, the number $555_{10}$ must satisfy the condition $b^3 \\leq 555_{10} < b^4$. This means we are looking for a base where $b^3$ is less than or equal to 555 and $b^4$ is greater than 555.\n\n## Step 2: Find the smallest possible base\nWe start by finding the smallest integer $b$ such that $b^3 \\leq 555$. We know that $8^3 = 512$ and $9^3 = 729$, so the smallest base $b$ that satisfies the condition is $b = 6$ because $6^3 = 216$ which is less than 555, and $7^3 = 343$ which is also less than 555 but $8^3 = 512$ is closer and still less than 555.\n\n## Step 3: Find the largest possible base\nNext, we find the largest integer $b$ such that $b^4 > 555$. Since $5^4 = 625$ and $4^4 = 256$, the largest base $b$ that satisfies the condition is $b = 5$ because $5^4$ is greater than 555.\n\n## Step 4: Test possible bases\nNow, we test the bases between 5 and 8 (inclusive) to see which one results in a 4-digit number in the form ABAB when $555_{10}$ is converted to that base.\n\n## Step 5: Convert $555_{10}$ to base 6\nStarting with base 6: $555_{10}$ divided by 6 gives a quotient of 92 and a remainder of 3. 92 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 15 and a remainder of 2. 15 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 3. 2 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 2. So, in base 6, $555_{10}$ is $2323_6$, which matches the ABAB pattern.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
