    "problem": "A positive five-digit integer is in the form $AB,CBA$; where $A$, $B$ and $C$ are each distinct digits. What is the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven?",
    "solution": "We can test an integer for divisibility by $11$ by alternately adding and subtracting its digits.  For example, $8162$ is divisible by 11 because $8-1+6-2=11$ is divisible by 11.  In this case, $2A-2B+C$ must be divisible by 11.  If there are satisfactory values of $B$ and $C$ corresponding to $A=9$, then the resulting integer would be larger than any integer with $A<9$.  Therefore, we try $A=9$ first.  If $A=9$, then $C-2B+18$ must be divisible by $11$.  Equivalently, $C-2B$ equals $-7$ or $4$, which implies $C=2B-7$ or $C=2B+4$.  Wanting to make $B$ as large as possible, we try $B=9,8,7,\\ldots$. $B$ cannot be $9$ because $A$, $B$, and $C$ must be distinct.  If $B=8$, then $C=9$, so again the digits are not distinct.  If $B=7$, then $C=7$ and still the digits are not distinct.  If $B=6$, then $C=5$, and $AB,\\!CBA=\\boxed{96,\\!569}$.",

    "model_solution": "To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we can use the alternating sum of its digits rule. For the number $AB,CBA$, this rule translates to:\n\n$A - B + C - B + A = 2A - 2B + C$\n\nFor $AB,CBA$ to be divisible by 11, $2A - 2B + C$ must be divisible by 11.\n\nSince we're looking for the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$, we should start with the largest possible value for $A$, which is 9 (since it's a five-digit number and $A$ cannot be 0).\n\nSo, let's set $A = 9$ and try to find suitable values for $B$ and $C$ that make $2A - 2B + C$ divisible by 11.\n\nGiven $A = 9$, the equation becomes:\n\n$2(9) - 2B + C = 18 - 2B + C$\n\nWe need $18 - 2B + C$ to be divisible by 11. Let's try to find the largest possible $B$ that could work, keeping in mind that $B$ and $C$ must be distinct digits and that $C$ cannot be 9 (since $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct).\n\nLet's consider $B = 8$ (next largest digit after 9):\n\n$18 - 2(8) + C = 18 - 16 + C = 2 + C$\n\nFor $2 + C$ to be divisible by 11, $C$ would need to be 9, which is not possible since $A = 9$ and $A$, $B$, and $C$ must be distinct.\n\nLet's try $B = 7$:\n\n$18 - 2(7) + C = 18 - 14 + C = 4 + C$\n\nFor $4 + C$ to be divisible by 11, $C$ would need to be 7, which again is not possible since $B = 7$.\n\nLet's try $B = 6$:\n\n$18 - 2(6) + C = 18 - 12 + C = 6 + C$\n\nFor $6 + C$ to be divisible by 11, $C$ would need to be 5, which is a valid option since $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct.\n\nSo, we have $A = 9$, $B = 6$, and $C = 5$, making the number $96,569$.\n\nThis satisfies the condition of being divisible by 11 (since $2A - 2B + C = 18 - 12 + 5 = 11$), and it's the largest such number given the constraints.\n\nThe final! answer is: $\\boxed{96569}$"
