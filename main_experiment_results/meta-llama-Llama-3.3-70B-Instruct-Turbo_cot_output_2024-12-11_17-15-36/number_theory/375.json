    "problem": "How many even divisors does $7!$ have?",
    "solution": "By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, we may count the number of even divisors of $7!$ by counting the number of ways to form the prime factorization of an even divisor of $7!$.  Suppose that $7!$ is divisible by an even positive integer $r$.  Since the prime factorization of $7!$ is $7\\cdot(2\\cdot3)\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\cdot2)\\cdot3\\cdot2=2^4\\cdot3^2\\cdot5\\cdot7$, the prime factorization of $r$ does not include any primes other than $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$.  Express $r$ in terms of its prime factorization as $2^a3^b5^c7^d$.  Then $7!/r=2^{4-a}3^{2-b}5^{1-c}7^{1-d}$.  Since $7!/r$ is an integer, $d$ must equal $0$ or $1$, $c$ must equal $0$ or $1$, and $b$ must equal $0$, $1$ or $2$.  Finally, $a$ may be no larger than $4$, but it must be at least $1$ since $r$ is even.  Altogether there are $2\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=48$ total possibilities for the four exponents $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, and hence $\\boxed{48}$ even divisors.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the prime factorization of 7!\nTo find the number of divisors, we first need to calculate the prime factorization of 7!. The prime factorization of 7! is 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^1 * 7^1.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the requirements for an even divisor\nAn even divisor must include at least one factor of 2. Since 7! has 2^4 in its prime factorization, any divisor that includes 2^0 (or no 2s) would be odd. Thus, for an even divisor, we can choose 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, or 2^4.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of choices for each prime factor\nFor 2, we have 4 choices (2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4) because we exclude 2^0 to ensure the divisor is even.\nFor 3, we have 3 choices (3^0, 3^1, 3^2) since any power of 3 (including zero) can be included in an even divisor.\nFor 5, we have 2 choices (5^0, 5^1) because, like 3, any power of 5 can be included.\nFor 7, we also have 2 choices (7^0, 7^1) for the same reason.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of even divisors\nTo find the total number of even divisors, we multiply the number of choices for each prime factor: 4 choices for 2 * 3 choices for 3 * 2 choices for 5 * 2 choices for 7.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the multiplication\nTotal number of even divisors = 4 * 3 * 2 * 2 = 48.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{48}$"
