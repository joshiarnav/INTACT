    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the condition for $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ to be an integer\nFor $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ to be an integer, $n$ must divide $n+18$ because $\\frac{n+18}{n} = 1 + \\frac{18}{n}$. This implies that $n$ must also divide $18$ since $n$ divides both $n+18$ and $n$, thus it must divide their difference, which is $18$.\n\n## Step 2: List all the positive divisors of 18\nThe positive divisors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. These are the potential values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ an integer.\n\n## Step 3: Verify each potential value of $n$\nWe need to verify that each of these divisors indeed makes $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ an integer.\n- For $n=1$, $\\frac{1+18}{1} = 19$, which is an integer.\n- For $n=2$, $\\frac{2+18}{2} = 10$, which is an integer.\n- For $n=3$, $\\frac{3+18}{3} = 7$, which is an integer.\n- For $n=6$, $\\frac{6+18}{6} = 4$, which is an integer.\n- For $n=9$, $\\frac{9+18}{9} = 3$, which is an integer.\n- For $n=18$, $\\frac{18+18}{18} = 2$, which is an integer.\nAll potential values of $n$ are valid.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of all valid $n$ values\nThe sum of all valid $n$ values is $1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 18$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the addition\n$1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 18 = 39$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{39}$"
