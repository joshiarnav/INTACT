    "problem": "What is the base $2$ representation of $84_{10}$?",
    "solution": "We first find that the largest power of $2$ that is less than $84$ is $2^6 = 64$. Our next step is to find the largest power of $2$ that is less than $84 - 64 = 20$ which is $2^4=16$. This leaves us left with $20 - 16 = 4$, but $4 = 2 ^2$, so we have $$84 = 1 \\cdot 2^6 + 0 \\cdot 2^5 + 1 \\cdot 2^4 + 0 \\cdot 2^3 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 0 \\cdot 2^0.$$Thus, our base $2$ representation of $84_{10}$ is $\\boxed{1010100_2}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to convert the decimal number $84_{10}$ into its binary (base 2) representation.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the conversion method\nTo convert a decimal number to binary, we repeatedly divide the decimal number by 2 and record the remainder. The process continues until the quotient becomes 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders in reverse order.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the conversion method\nStarting with $84_{10}$, we divide by 2 and record the remainder.\n\n## Step 4: First division\n$84 \\div 2 = 42$ with a remainder of 0.\n\n## Step 5: Second division\n$42 \\div 2 = 21$ with a remainder of 0.\n\n## Step 6: Third division\n$21 \\div 2 = 10$ with a remainder of 1.\n\n## Step 7: Fourth division\n$10 \\div 2 = 5$ with a remainder of 0.\n\n## Step 8: Fifth division\n$5 \\div 2 = 2$ with a remainder of 1.\n\n## Step 9: Sixth division\n$2 \\div 2 = 1$ with a remainder of 0.\n\n## Step 10: Seventh division\n$1 \\div 2 = 0$ with a remainder of 1.\n\n## Step 11: Write the binary representation\nThe remainders from the last to the first division are 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0. So, the binary representation of $84_{10}$ is $1010100_2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10101002}$"
