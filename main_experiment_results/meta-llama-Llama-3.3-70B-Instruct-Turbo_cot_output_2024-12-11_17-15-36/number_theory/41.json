    "problem": "If $k$ and $\\ell$ are positive 4-digit integers such that $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$, what is the smallest possible value for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$?",
    "solution": "The identity $\\gcd(k,\\ell)\\cdot\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = k\\ell$ holds for all positive integers $k$ and $\\ell$. Thus, we have $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = \\frac{k\\ell}{3}.$$Also, $k$ and $\\ell$ must be 4-digit multiples of $3$, so our choices for each are $$1002,1005,1008,1011,1014,\\ldots,$$and by minimizing the product $k\\ell$, we minimize the least common multiple of $k$ and $\\ell$. However, $k$ and $\\ell$ cannot both be $1002$, since their greatest common divisor would then be $1002$ (not $3$). Setting $k=1002$ and $\\ell=1005$, we obtain $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$ as desired, and we obtain the smallest possible value for the least common multiple: \\begin{align*}\n\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[1002,1005] &= \\frac{1002\\cdot 1005}{3} \\\\\n&= 1002\\cdot 335 \\\\\n&= (1000\\cdot 335)+(2\\cdot 335)\\\\\n&= \\boxed{335{,}670}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and recall the relationship between gcd and lcm\nThe problem asks for the smallest possible value for the least common multiple (lcm) of two positive 4-digit integers $k$ and $\\ell$ such that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 3. Recall that for any two integers $a$ and $b$, $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = a \\cdot b$.\n\n## Step 2: Express the relationship between lcm and gcd\nUsing the relationship from step 1, we have $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = \\frac{k \\cdot \\ell}{\\gcd(k,\\ell)}$. Given $\\gcd(k,\\ell) = 3$, the equation simplifies to $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = \\frac{k \\cdot \\ell}{3}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the conditions for k and \u2113\nSince $k$ and $\\ell$ are positive 4-digit integers and $\\gcd(k,\\ell) = 3$, both $k$ and $\\ell$ must be multiples of 3 but cannot both be multiples of any higher power of 3 or any other prime number (to maintain the gcd of 3).\n\n## Step 4: Find the smallest possible 4-digit multiples of 3\nThe smallest 4-digit multiple of 3 is 1002 (since 1000 is not divisible by 3, and 1002 is the first number after 1000 that is divisible by 3). To minimize the lcm, we want $k$ and $\\ell$ to be as small as possible while still meeting the conditions.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the next multiple of 3 after 1002 that is not a multiple of any higher power of 3 or other common factors\nThe next multiple of 3 after 1002 is 1005. However, to ensure the gcd remains 3 and not higher, we need to select numbers that do not share additional factors. 1002 and 1005 share only the factor of 3, making them suitable choices for $k$ and $\\ell$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the lcm using the selected values for k and \u2113\nSubstitute $k = 1002$ and $\\ell = 1005$ into the simplified formula from step 2: $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[1002,1005] = \\frac{1002 \\cdot 1005}{3}$.\n\n## Step 7: Perform the calculation\nCalculate the numerator first: $1002 \\cdot 1005 = 1,007,010$. Then divide by 3: $\\frac{1,007,010}{3} = 335,670$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{335670}$"
