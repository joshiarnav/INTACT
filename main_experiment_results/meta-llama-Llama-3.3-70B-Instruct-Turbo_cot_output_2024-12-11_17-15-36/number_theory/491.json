    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nMarcus has two numbers, $a$ and $b$, and we are given the remainders when $a$ and $b$ are divided by 45 and 30, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Express $a$ and $b$ based on the given remainders\nWhen $a$ is divided by 45, the remainder is 37, so we can express $a$ as $a = 45n + 37$, where $n$ is an integer. Similarly, when $b$ is divided by 30, the remainder is 9, so we can express $b$ as $b = 30m + 9$, where $m$ is an integer.\n\n## Step 3: Add $a$ and $b$ to find $a + b$\nTo find the remainder when $a + b$ is divided by 15, we first add $a$ and $b$:\n$a + b = (45n + 37) + (30m + 9)$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression for $a + b$\nCombine like terms:\n$a + b = 45n + 30m + 46$.\n\n## Step 5: Factor out 15 from the first two terms\nSince $45 = 15 \\times 3$ and $30 = 15 \\times 2$, we can factor out 15:\n$a + b = 15(3n + 2m) + 46$.\n\n## Step 6: Express 46 in terms of 15\nWe can express 46 as $15 \\times 3 + 1$, so:\n$a + b = 15(3n + 2m) + 15 \\times 3 + 1$.\n\n## Step 7: Combine the terms with 15\nCombine the terms with 15:\n$a + b = 15(3n + 2m + 3) + 1$.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the remainder when $a + b$ is divided by 15\nSince $15(3n + 2m + 3)$ is divisible by 15, the remainder when $a + b$ is divided by 15 is the remainder of 1 divided by 15, which is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
