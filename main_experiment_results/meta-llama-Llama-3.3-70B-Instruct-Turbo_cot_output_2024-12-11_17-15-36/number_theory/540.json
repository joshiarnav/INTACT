    "problem": "What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}?$",
    "solution": "First, we simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$ to $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, we have $$17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$This means that $17n$ can be written in the form $7a+2$, where $a$ is an integer. So we have $17n=7a+2$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\\frac{7a+2}{17}=n$ is an integer. By trying values for $a$, we find that the smallest integer $a$ which satisfies the equation is $7$. Therefore, the least value for $n$ is $\\frac{51}{17}=\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, we need to simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$ to find a smaller, equivalent number that is easier to work with.\n$1234 \\pmod{7} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$ because $1234 \\div 7 = 176$ with a remainder of $2$.\n\n## Step 2: Now, we need to solve the congruence $17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\nThis means that $17n$ can be expressed as $7k + 2$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\n## Step 3: Since $17 \\pmod{7} \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$, we can simplify the congruence further to $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\nThis step simplifies the calculation by reducing the coefficient of $n$ to its remainder when divided by $7$.\n\n## Step 4: To solve $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, we look for a multiplicative inverse of $3$ modulo $7$.\nThe multiplicative inverse of $3$ modulo $7$ is $5$ because $3 \\times 5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n## Step 5: Multiply both sides of the congruence $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$ by $5$ to solve for $n$.\nThis gives $5 \\times 3n \\equiv 5 \\times 2 \\pmod{7}$, simplifying to $n \\equiv 10 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify $10 \\pmod{7}$ to find the smallest positive integer $n$.\n$n \\equiv 10 \\pmod{7}$ simplifies to $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ because $10 \\div 7 = 1$ with a remainder of $3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
