    "problem": "When three positive integers are divided by $24$, the remainders are $10,$ $4,$ and $12,$ respectively.\n\nWhen the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, what is the remainder?",
    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 10\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 12\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 10+4+12 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $24$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the concept of remainders\nWhen a number is divided by another number, the remainder is what is left over after the division. For example, if we divide a number $x$ by $24$ and the remainder is $10$, we can represent $x$ as $x = 24k + 10$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\n## Step 2: Represent! the three integers based on the given remainders\nLet's denote the three integers as $a$, $b$, and $c$. Based on the information given:\n- $a$ can be represented as $a = 24m + 10$, where $m$ is an integer.\n- $b$ can be represented as $b = 24n + 4$, where $n$ is an integer.\n- $c$ can be represented as $c = 24p + 12$, where $p$ is an integer.\n\n## Step 3: Find the sum of the three integers\nThe sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ can be found by adding their representations:\n\\[a + b + c = (24m + 10) + (24n + 4) + (24p + 12)\\]\n\\[a + b + c = 24m + 24n + 24p + 10 + 4 + 12\\]\n\\[a + b + c = 24(m + n + p) + 26\\]\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the sum to find the remainder when divided by 24\nSince $24(m + n + p)$ is divisible by $24$ (because it's $24$ times an integer), we only need to consider the remainder of $26$ when divided by $24$ to find the overall remainder of the sum $a + b + c$.\n\\[26 = 24 \\times 1 + 2\\]\nSo, the remainder when $26$ is divided by $24$ is $2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
