    "solution": "In order to find the product of the two, we first convert both values into base 10. We have that $1001_2=1(2^3)+0(2^2)+0(2^1)+1(2^0)=8+1=9$, and that $121_3=1(3^2)+2(3^1)+1(3^0)=9+6+1=16$. The product of the two is just $(9)(16)=\\boxed{144}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to first convert both numbers to base 10, then multiply them.\n\nStep 1: Convert $1001_2$ to base 10.\n\n$1001_2$ is a binary number. To convert it to base 10, we calculate:\n\n$1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9$.\n\nSo, $1001_2 = 9$ in base 10.\n\nStep 2: Convert $121_3$ to base 10.\n\n$121_3$ is a ternary number. To convert it to base 10, we calculate:\n\n$1*3^2 + 2*3^1 + 1*3^0 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16$.\n\nSo, $121_3 = 16$ in base 10.\n\nStep 3: Multiply the two numbers in base 10.\n\nNow that we have both numbers in base 10, we can multiply them:\n\n$9 * 16 = 144$.\n\nTherefore, the product of $1001_2$ and $121_3$ in base 10 is $\\boxed{144}$."
