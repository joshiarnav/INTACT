    "solution": "Dealing with the second condition, it is set up in the following manner. $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&&C_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&0_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$Because $B+C$ can not equal $0$, we must carry in this column. Therefore, we arrive at two equations. $B+C-6=0$ and $A+1=C$ Looking at the third condition: $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&B&A_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&C_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$We can determine that no carrying occurs. Therefore, $A+B=C$. We now have a system of equations for our three variables. \\[B+C-6=0\\]\\[A+1=C\\]\\[A+B=C\\]Subtracting the third equation from the second, $1-B=0$, or $B=1$. Plugging that into our first equation we can determine that $C=5$. $A$ must then equal $4$. Thus, $\\overline{ABC}$ is $\\boxed{415}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the problem and the given equations\nWe are given two equations in base-6: ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$ and ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$. We need to find the three-digit number ${ABC}$ where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are non-zero distinct digits less than 6.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the first equation in base-6\nThe first equation is ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$. In base-6, this means $6A + B + C = 6C + 0$. Simplifying, we get $6A + B = 5C$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing the second equation in base-6\nThe second equation is ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$. In base-6, this translates to $6A + B + 6B + A = 6C + C$. Simplifying, we get $7A + 7B = 7C$, which further simplifies to $A + B = C$ since $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct non-zero digits less than 6 and thus $7$ does not need to be considered as a factor in base-6.\n\n## Step 4: Solving the system of equations\nWe have two simplified equations: $6A + B = 5C$ and $A + B = C$. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n\n## Step 5: Substituting $A + B = C$ into $6A + B = 5C$\nSubstituting $C$ for $A + B$ in the first equation gives us $6A + (C - A) = 5C$. Simplifying, we get $5A = 4C$.\n\n## Step 6: Finding possible values for $A$ and $C$\nSince $A$ and $C$ are distinct non-zero digits less than 6, and considering $5A = 4C$, we look for combinations that satisfy this equation. Given the constraint that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are less than 6, we can test values for $A$ and $C$ that fit this equation.\n\n## Step 7: Testing values for $A$ and $C$\nThe only combination that works under the given constraints is $A = 4$ and $C = 5$ because $5*4 = 20$ and $4*5 = 20$, which satisfies $5A = 4C$.\n\n## Step 8: Finding the value of $B$\nWith $A = 4$ and $C = 5$, we substitute back into $A + B = C$ to find $B$. So, $4 + B = 5$, which gives us $B = 1$.\n\n## Step 9: Constructing the three-digit number ${ABC}$\nNow that we have $A = 4$, $B = 1$, and $C = 5$, we can construct the three-digit number ${ABC}$ as $415$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{415}$"
