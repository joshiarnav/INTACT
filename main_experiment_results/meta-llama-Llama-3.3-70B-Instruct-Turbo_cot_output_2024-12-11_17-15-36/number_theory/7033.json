    "problem": "The number $r$ can be expressed as a four-place decimal $0.abcd,$ where $a, b, c,$ and $d$ represent digits, any of which could be zero. It is desired to approximate $r$ by a fraction whose numerator is 1 or 2 and whose denominator is an integer.

    "solution": "The nearest fractions to $\\frac 27$ with numerator $1$ are $\\frac 13, \\frac 14$; and with numerator $2$ are $\\frac 26, \\frac 28 = \\frac 13, \\frac 14$ anyway. For $\\frac 27$ to be the best approximation for $r$, the decimal must be closer to $\\frac 27 \\approx .28571$ than to $\\frac 13 \\approx .33333$ or $\\frac 14 \\approx .25$.\nThus $r$ can range between $\\frac{\\frac 14 + \\frac{2}{7}}{2} \\approx .267857$ and $\\frac{\\frac 13 + \\frac{2}{7}}{2} \\approx .309523$. At $r = .2679, .3095$, it becomes closer to the other fractions, so $.2679 \\le r \\le .3095$ and the number of values of $r$ is $3095 - 2679 + 1 = \\boxed{417}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the number of possible values for $r$, where $r$ is a four-place decimal $0.abcd$ and the closest fraction to $r$ with a numerator of 1 or 2 and an integer denominator is $\\frac{2}{7}$.\n\n## Step 2: Converting the fraction to a decimal\nTo compare $r$ with $\\frac{2}{7}$, we first need to convert $\\frac{2}{7}$ to a decimal. The decimal representation of $\\frac{2}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{285714}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determining the closest fractions\nSince the closest fraction to $r$ is $\\frac{2}{7}$, we need to consider the closest fractions with a numerator of 1 or 2 to $\\frac{2}{7}$. These fractions are $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{3}$, $\\frac{2}{5}$, and $\\frac{2}{9}$, but we are interested in the ones that could be the closest to $r$ given the constraint of $r$ being a four-place decimal.\n\n## Step 4: Finding the decimal representations\nConverting these fractions to decimals: $\\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$, $\\frac{1}{3} = 0.\\overline{3}$, $\\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$, and $\\frac{2}{9} = 0.\\overline{2}$. Given that $r$ is a four-place decimal, we are looking for values of $r$ that are closer to $\\frac{2}{7}$ than to any of these fractions.\n\n## Step 5: Establishing the range for $r$\nThe midpoint between $\\frac{2}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ is $(0.285714 + 0.25)/2 = 0.267857$, and the midpoint between $\\frac{2}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ is approximately $(0.285714 + 0.333333)/2 = 0.3095235$. Similarly, we need to consider the midpoints with $\\frac{2}{5}$ and $\\frac{2}{9}$, but given that $\\frac{2}{7}$ is $0.285714...$, the closest fractions to consider are those immediately below and above it in value.\n\n## Step 6: Calculating the exact midpoints\nThe exact midpoints to consider are between $0.285714$ and the closest lower fraction $0.25$ (from $\\frac{1}{4}$) and the closest higher fraction $0.4$ (from $\\frac{2}{5}$), as $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{2}{9}$ are less relevant due to their decimal representations being further away.\n\n## Step 7: Finding the range\nTo find the range in which $r$ can exist, we consider the midpoints between $\\frac{2}{7}$ and its closest neighboring fractions that could be considered as the closest to $r$. The closest lower fraction is $\\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$ and the closest higher fraction is $\\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$. The midpoints are thus: $(0.285714 + 0.25)/2 = 0.267857$ and $(0.285714 + 0.4)/2 = 0.342857$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculating the possible values for $r$\nGiven that $r$ is a four-place decimal, we calculate the possible values of $r$ that are closer to $\\frac{2}{7}$ than to any other fraction with a numerator of 1 or 2. The lower bound is $0.267857 < r$ and the upper bound is $r < 0.342857$. Since $r$ is a four-place decimal, we count the number of four-place decimals within this range.\n\n## Step 9: Counting the possible values\nThe smallest four-place decimal greater than $0.267857$ is $0.2679$ and the largest four-place decimal less than $0.342857$ is $0.3428$. We calculate the number of possible values by considering all four-place decimals between these two values.\n\n## Step 10: Final calculation\nTo find the total number of possible values for $r$, we calculate the difference between the largest and smallest possible values and then add 1 (since both ends are inclusive). The values range from $0.2679$ to $0.3428$, which translates to $2679$ to $3428$ when considering the integers after multiplying by $10^4$. The number of values is $3428 - 2679 + 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{421}$"
