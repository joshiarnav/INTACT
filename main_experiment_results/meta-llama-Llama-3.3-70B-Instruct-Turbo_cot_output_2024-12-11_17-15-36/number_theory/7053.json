    "solution": "The $231$ cubes which are not visible must lie below exactly one layer of cubes. Thus, they form a rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension.

The prime factorization of $231 = 3\\cdot7\\cdot11$, so we have a variety of possibilities; for instance, $l - 1 = 1$ and $m - 1 = 11$ and $n - 1 = 3 \\cdot 7$, among others. However, it should be fairly clear that the way to minimize $l\\cdot m\\cdot n$ is to make $l$ and $m$ and $n$ as close together as possible, which occurs when the smaller block is $3 \\times 7 \\times 11$. Then the extra layer makes the entire block $4\\times8\\times12$, and $N= \\boxed{384}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the problem\nThe problem describes a rectangular block formed by gluing $N$ congruent 1-cm cubes face to face. When the block is viewed so that three of its faces are visible, exactly $231$ of the 1-cm cubes cannot be seen. The goal is to find the smallest possible value of $N$.\n\n## Step 2: Breaking down the configuration\nThe $231$ cubes that are not visible must lie below exactly one layer of cubes. Therefore, they form a smaller rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension than the original block.\n\n## Step 3: Expressing the relationship between visible and hidden cubes\nAssuming the original block has dimensions $l \\times m \\times n$, we can express the fact that the smaller block has dimensions $(l - 1)\\times(m-1) \\times(n - 1)$, and it is composed of $231$ cubes.\n\n## Step 4: Finding the prime factorization of 231\nThe prime factorization of $231$ is $3 \\times 7 \\times 11$.\n\n## Step 5: Determining the dimensions of the smaller block\nTo minimize the product $l\\cdot m\\cdot n$, we need to make $l$, $m$, and $n$ as close together as possible. This occurs when the smaller block is $3 \\times 7 \\times 11$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculating the dimensions of the original block\nAdding an extra layer to the smaller block gives the entire block the dimensions of $4\\times8\\times12$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculating the smallest possible value of N\nThe smallest possible value of $N$ is then $4 \\times 8 \\times 12 = 384$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{384}$"
