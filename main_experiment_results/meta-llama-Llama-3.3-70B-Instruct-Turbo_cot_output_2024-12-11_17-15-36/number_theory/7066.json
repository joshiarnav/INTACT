    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the product of the first 100 positive odd integers\nThe product of the first 100 positive odd integers can be represented as $P = 1 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times \\cdots \\times 199$. This can also be expressed as $P = \\frac{1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times \\cdots \\times 200}{2 \\times 4 \\times 6 \\times \\cdots \\times 200} = \\frac{200!}{2^{100} \\times 100!}$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the prime factorization of P in terms of 3\nTo find the largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k$, we need to determine the number of factors of 3 in $P$. This involves finding the number of factors of 3 in $200!$ and subtracting the number of factors of 3 in $100!$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of factors of 3 in 200!\nThe number of factors of 3 in $200!$ can be calculated by counting the multiples of 3, then adding the multiples of $3^2$, and finally adding the multiples of $3^3$, and so on. This can be represented as $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{200}{9}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{27}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{81}\\right\\rfloor$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of factors of 3 in 100!\nSimilarly, the number of factors of 3 in $100!$ can be calculated as $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{3}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{100}{9}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{27}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{81}\\right\\rfloor$.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the expressions for 200! and 100!\nEvaluating the expressions:\n- For $200!$: $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{200}{9}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{27}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{81}\\right\\rfloor = 66 + 22 + 7 + 2 = 97$.\n- For $100!$: $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{3}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{100}{9}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{27}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{81}\\right\\rfloor = 33 + 11 + 3 + 1 = 48$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the largest integer k\nThe largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k$ is the difference between the number of factors of 3 in $200!$ and the number of factors of 3 in $100!$, which is $97 - 48 = 49$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{49}$"
