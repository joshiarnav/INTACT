    "problem": "Find the least odd prime factor of $2019^8+1$.\n",
    "solution": "We know that $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ for some prime $p$. We want to find the smallest odd possible value of $p$. By squaring both sides of the congruence, we find $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is a positive divisor of $16$.\nHowever, if the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $1, 2, 4,$ or $8,$ then $2019^8$ will be equivalent to $1 \\pmod{p},$ which contradicts the given requirement that $2019^8\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$.\nTherefore, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $16$. Because all orders modulo $p$ divide $\\phi(p)$, we see that $\\phi(p)$ is a multiple of $16$. As $p$ is prime, $\\phi(p) = p\\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{p}\\right) = p - 1$. Therefore, $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$. The two smallest primes equivalent to $1 \\pmod{16}$ are $17$ and $97$. As $2019^8 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$ and $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{97}$, the smallest possible $p$ is thus $\\boxed{97}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: We need to find the least odd prime factor of the expression $2019^8+1$.\nTo approach this problem, we should first understand the properties of prime numbers and modular arithmetic, as they can provide insights into finding the prime factors of the given expression.\n\n## Step 2: Utilize the properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the expression.\nWe can use modular arithmetic to simplify $2019^8 \\pmod{p}$ for some prime $p$. If $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$, then $p$ must be odd, as $2019^8$ is even if $p = 2$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the properties of quadratic residues to the simplified expression.\nBy squaring both sides of the congruence $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$, we get $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. This implies that the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is a positive divisor of $16$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the possible orders of $2019$ modulo $p$.\nHowever, if the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $1, 2, 4,$ or $8,$ then $2019^8$ will be equivalent to $1\\pmod{p}$, which contradicts the requirement that $2019^8\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ and its implications.\nTherefore, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $16$. Because all orders modulo $p$ divide $\\phi(p)$, where $\\phi(p)$ is Euler's totient function, $\\phi(p)$ is a multiple of $16$. As $\\phi(p) = p\\left(1 -!rac{1}{p}\\right) = p - 1$, we have $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the smallest prime equivalent to $1$ modulo $16$.\nThe two smallest primes equivalent to $1 \\pmod{16}$ are $17$ and $97$. We need to check which of these satisfies $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\n## Step 7: Test $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$ and $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{97}$.\nAfter testing, we find that $2019^8 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$ and $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{97}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{97}$"
