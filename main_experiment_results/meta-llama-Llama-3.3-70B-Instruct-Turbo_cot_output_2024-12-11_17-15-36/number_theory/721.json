    "solution": "The first odd multiple of 3 is 3. The next is 9, then 15, 21, adding 6 each time. The $n$th odd multiple of 3 is $6n-3$; the 10th odd multiple of 3 is therefore $60-3=\\boxed{57}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the pattern for odd multiples of 3**: Odd numbers are those which cannot be divided evenly by 2. Multiples of 3 are those numbers which can be divided evenly by 3. The first few odd multiples of 3 are 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57.\n\n2. **List the sequence**: By following the pattern, we list the sequence of odd multiples of 3 until we reach the tenth number:\n   - 1st: 3\n   - 2nd: 9\n   - 3rd: 15\n   - 4th: 21\n   - 5th: 27\n   - 6th: 33\n   - 7th: 39\n   - 8th: 45\n   - 9th: 51\n   - 10th: 57\n\n3. **Conclusion**: From the sequence, the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is 57.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57}$"
