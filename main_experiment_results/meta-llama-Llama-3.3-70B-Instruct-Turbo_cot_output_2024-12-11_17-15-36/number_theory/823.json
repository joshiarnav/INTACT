    "problem": "Kaleb defined a $\\emph{clever integer}$ as an even integer that is greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9. What fraction of all clever integers is divisible by 27? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "You can easily list out the numbers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add to 9: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.\n\nTo be a $\\emph{clever integer}$ the number must be even, which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, a total of 5 numbers.\n\nThe problem asks which fraction of these five clever integers are divisible by 27. Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the range of clever integers.\nTo find clever integers, we need to look for even integers greater than 20, less than 120, and whose digits sum up to 9. The possible range of clever integers is from 22 to 118, considering the constraints.\n\n## Step 2: Identify all clever integers in the given range.\nWe need to list out all the even numbers between 22 and 118 whose digits sum up to 9. Possible candidates include 27 (not even, so excluded), 36, 45 (not even, so excluded), 54, 63 (not even, so excluded), 72, 81 (not even, so excluded), 90, 108, and 117 (not even and out of range, so excluded). So, the clever integers are 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108.\n\n## Step 3: Determine which clever integers are divisible by 27.\nFrom the list of clever integers (36, 54, 72, 90, 108), we need to find which ones are divisible by 27. 54 and 108 are divisible by 27.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the fraction of clever integers divisible by 27.\nThere are 5 clever integers in total, and 2 of them (54 and 108) are divisible by 27. To find the fraction, we divide the number of clever integers divisible by 27 by the total number of clever integers. So, the fraction is 2/5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$"
