    "problem": "Let $S = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + \\cdots + 2009 - 2010$. What is the residue of $S$, modulo 2010?",
    "solution": "Note that $x + 2010 \\equiv x \\pmod{2010}$. Add 2010 to every negative summand and rearrange the terms to find $S \\equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 2008 + 2009 \\pmod{2010}$. The right-hand side is the sum of the integers from 1 to 2010, so $S \\equiv \\frac{2010 \\cdot 2011}{2} \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 2011 \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 1 \\equiv \\boxed{1005} \\pmod{2010}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the pattern of the series\nThe given series $S = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + \\cdots + 2009 - 2010$ is an alternating sum of consecutive integers. We notice that the terms alternate between positive and negative.\n\n## Step 2: Pair the terms of the series\nWe can pair the terms of the series as follows: $(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + \\cdots + (2009 - 2010)$. Each pair sums to $-1$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of pairs\nSince the series ends at 2010, which is an even number, every term can be paired. The number of pairs can be calculated by dividing the total number of terms by 2. There are 2010 terms in total (since we are counting from 1 to 2010), so there are $2010 / 2 = 1005$ pairs.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of the pairs\nEach pair sums to $-1$, and there are 1005 pairs. Therefore, the sum of all the pairs is $-1 \\times 1005 = -1005$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the residue modulo 2010\nTo find the residue of $S$ modulo 2010, we take the sum $S$ and find its remainder when divided by 2010. Since $S = -1005$, we need to find $-1005 \\mod 2010$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the modulo operation\nWhen dividing $-1005$ by $2010$, we get a quotient of $-1$ and a remainder of $1005$ (since $-1005 = -1 \\times 2010 + 1005$). Therefore, $-1005 \\mod 2010 = 1005$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1005}$"
