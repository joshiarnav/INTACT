    "problem": "What is $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\pmod{25}$? Express your answer as an integer from $0$ to $24$, inclusive.",
    "solution": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 3 and 9 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 13 + \\frac 19 \\equiv \\frac{9 + 3}{27} \\equiv \\frac{12}{2} \\equiv \\boxed{6} \\pmod{25}.$$We can justify this as follows: let $a \\equiv 3^{-1} \\pmod{25}$ and $b \\equiv 9^{-1} \\pmod{25}$. Then $27a \\equiv 9 \\pmod{25}$ and $27b \\equiv 3 \\pmod{25}$. Summing these congruences shows that $27(a+b) \\equiv 2(a+b) \\equiv 9 + 3 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{25}$, so $a+b \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}$, as desired.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the value of $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\pmod{25}$, which means we need to calculate the modular inverse of $3$ and $9$ modulo $25$, add them together, and then find the remainder when divided by $25$.\n\n## Step 2: Finding the modular inverse of 3 modulo 25\nTo find $3^{-1} \\pmod{25}$, we need to find a number $x$ such that $3x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$. This involves finding the multiplicative inverse of $3$ in the group of integers modulo $25$. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find this inverse.\n\n## Step 3: Calculating the modular inverse of 3 modulo 25\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm or by inspection, we find that $3 \\times 17 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$ because $3 \\times 17 = 51$ and $51 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$. Therefore, $3^{-1} \\equiv 17 \\pmod{25}$.\n\n## Step 4: Finding the modular inverse of 9 modulo 25\nSince $9 = 3^2$, $9^{-1} = (3^{-1})^2$. We already know that $3^{-1} \\equiv 17 \\pmod{25}$, so $9^{-1} \\equiv (17)^2 \\pmod{25}$. Calculating $17^2$ gives us $289$, and $289 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{25}$ because $289 = 25 \\times 11 + 14$. Therefore, $9^{-1} \\equiv 14 \\pmod{25}$.\n\n## Step 5: Adding the modular inverses and reducing modulo 25\nNow, we add $3^{-1}$ and $3^{-2}$, which are $17$ and $14$ respectively, and then reduce the sum modulo $25$. So, $17 + 14 = 31$.\n\n## Step 6: Reducing the sum modulo 25\nTo reduce $31$ modulo $25$, we find the remainder when $31$ is divided by $25$. Since $31 = 25 + 6$, the remainder is $6$. Therefore, $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
