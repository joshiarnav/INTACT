    "problem": "For some positive integer $k$, when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. What is the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$?",
    "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nWe are given that when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. This can be represented as $60 = qk^2 + 6$, where $q$ is the quotient of the division.\n\n## Step 2: Rearrange the equation to find a relationship involving $k^2$\nRearranging the equation from step 1, we get $60 - 6 = qk^2$, which simplifies to $54 = qk^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Factorize 54 to understand possible values for $k^2$\n54 can be factorized into its prime factors as $2 \\times 3^3$. Since $k^2$ must be a factor of 54, the possible values for $k^2$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 18, 27$, and $54$. However, $k^2$ must also be a perfect square, narrowing down the possibilities to $1, 4, 9$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the possible values for $k$\nFrom the possible values of $k^2$ ($1, 4, 9$), we find $k$ by taking the square root. Thus, $k$ could be $1, 2$, or $3$.\n\n## Step 5: Test each possible value of $k$ to see if it satisfies the original condition\nFor $k = 1$, $k^2 = 1$, and $60$ divided by $1$ gives a remainder of $0$, not $6$. For $k = 2$, $k^2 = 4$, and $60$ divided by $4$ gives a remainder of $0$, not $6$. For $k = 3$, $k^2 = 9$, and $60$ divided by $9$ gives a quotient of $6$ with a remainder of $6$, satisfying the condition.\n\n## Step 6: Find the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$\nNow that we've determined $k = 3$, we divide $100$ by $3$ to find the remainder. $100$ divided by $3$ gives a quotient of $33$ with a remainder of $1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
