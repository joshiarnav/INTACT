    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the modular multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 185, which is a number x such that $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the definition of modular multiplicative inverse\nThe modular multiplicative inverse of a number a modulo m is a number x such that $ax \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$. In this case, we are looking for x such that $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the inverse\nTo find the modular multiplicative inverse, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This algorithm finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers and expresses it as a linear combination of the two numbers.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm\nWe apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the gcd of 2 and 185, and express it as a linear combination of 2 and 185.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the gcd and the linear combination\nUsing the Euclidean Algorithm, we find that $\\gcd(2, 185) = 1$ since 185 is odd and 2 is even, and $1 = 185 - 2 \\times 92$. Therefore, $1 \\equiv 185 - 2 \\times 92 \\pmod{185}$, which simplifies to $1 \\equiv -92 \\times 2 \\pmod{185}$.\n\n## Step 6: Express the result in the required range\nSince we need the answer between 0 and 184, inclusive, and $-92 \\equiv 93 \\pmod{185}$, the modular multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 185 is 93.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{93}$"
