    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, let's determine the meaning of the given expression $n \\equiv 7882 \\pmod{5}$.\nThe expression $n \\equiv 7882 \\pmod{5}$ means that when $7882$ is divided by $5$, the remainder is $n$. In other words, $n$ is the remainder of $7882$ divided by $5$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the remainder when $7882$ is divided by $5$ to find the value of $n$.\nTo find the remainder, we perform the division: $7882 \\div 5 = 1576$ with a remainder of $2$. This means $7882 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n\n## Step 3: Given the constraint $4 \\le n \\le 8$, we need to find an integer $n$ within this range that satisfies $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\nSince $n$ must be between $4$ and $8$ (inclusive) and $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$, the possible values of $n$ in this range that leave a remainder of $2$ when divided by $5$ need to be determined.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the integer $n$ within the specified range that satisfies the condition $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\nThe only integer between $4$ and $8$ (inclusive) that leaves a remainder of $2$ when divided by $5$ is $7$, because $7 \\div 5 = 1$ with a remainder of $2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
