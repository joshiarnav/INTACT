    "problem": "The solution of $8x+1\\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$ is $x\\equiv a\\pmod{m}$ for some positive integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a<m$. Find $a+m$.",
    "solution": "Subtract 1 from both sides to obtain $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$. Add 12 to the right-hand side to get $8x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{12}$. Now divide both sides by 8, remembering to divide 12 by the greatest common factor of 12 and 8, thus obtaining $x \\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. This gives $a+m = 2 + 3 = \\boxed{5}$. Here we have used the fact that $ad \\equiv bd\\pmod{m}$ if and only if $a\\equiv b \\pmod{m/\\text{gcd}(m,d)}$, for integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a$, $b$, and $d$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given equation and the goal\nThe given equation is $8x + 1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$. The goal is to find the solution in the form $x \\equiv a \\pmod{m}$ and then calculate $a + m$.\n\n## Step 2: Subtract 1 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term involving $x$\nSubtracting 1 from both sides gives $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor of $8$ and $12$ if possible, but first, we need to make the coefficient of $x$ and the modulus coprime by adjusting the equation\nSince $\\gcd(8, 12) = 4$, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 4, which results in $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, because dividing the modulus 12 by the greatest common divisor 4 gives 3.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the simplified modular equation\nTo solve $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, we need to find an $x$ such that $2x \\mod 3 = 1$. Since $2 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify $a$ and $m$ from the solution\nFrom the solution $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, $a = 2$ and $m = 3$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $a + m$\nCalculate $a + m = 2 + 3 = 5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
