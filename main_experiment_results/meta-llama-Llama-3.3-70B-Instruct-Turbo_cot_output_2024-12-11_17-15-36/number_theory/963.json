    "problem": "The arithmetic progressions $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$ and $\\{3, 10, 17, 24, \\ldots \\}$ have some common values. What is the largest value less than 500 that they have in common?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be a common term. We know that \\begin{align*}\na&\\equiv 2\\pmod 3\\\\\na&\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer such that $a=2+3n$. Substituting this into $(2)$ yields \\[2+3n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 5\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $5$. Then $n\\ge 5\\implies a=2+3n\\ge 17$. $17$ satisfies the original congruences, so it is the smallest common term. Subtracting $17$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align*}\na-17&\\equiv -15\\equiv 0\\pmod 3\\nonumber\\\\\na-17&\\equiv -14\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\\nonumber\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,7)$, we get $a-17\\equiv 0\\pmod{3\\cdot 7}$, that is, $a\\equiv 17\\pmod{21}$.\n\nSo all common terms must be of the form $17+21m$ for some non-negative integer $m$. Note that any number of the form also satisfies the original congruences. The largest such number less than $500$ is $17+21\\cdot 22=\\boxed{479}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the common difference in each arithmetic progression\nThe first progression has a common difference of $5 - 2 = 3$, and the second progression has a common difference of $10 - 3 = 7$.\n\n## Step 2: Express the terms of each progression using a formula\nFor the first progression, the terms can be expressed as $2 + 3n$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer. For the second progression, the terms can be expressed as $3 + 7m$, where $m$ is a non-negative integer.\n\n## Step 3: Set up an equation to find the common terms\nTo find the common terms, we need to set the two expressions equal to each other: $2 + 3n = 3 + 7m$.\n\n## Step 4: Rearrange the equation to solve for one variable\nRearranging the equation gives $3n - 7m = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the linear Diophantine equation\nThis is a linear Diophantine equation. To solve it, we can use the method of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm or by inspection find a particular solution. A particular solution can be found by inspection or trial and error: $n = 5$ and $m = 2$ satisfy the equation because $3*5 - 7*2 = 15 - 14 = 1$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the general solution for n\nThe general solution for $n$ can be expressed as $n = n_{part} + \\frac{7}{\\gcd(3, 7)}k = 5 + 7k$, where $k$ is an integer and $\\gcd(3, 7) = 1$.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute the general solution for n back into the equation for the first progression\nSubstituting $n = 5 + 7k$ into $2 + 3n$ gives $2 + 3(5 + 7k) = 2 + 15 + 21k = 17 + 21k$.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the constraint for k to find values less than 500\nWe need $17 + 21k < 500$. Solving this inequality for $k$ gives $21k < 483$, so $k < \\frac{483}{21}$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the maximum value of k\nCalculating the maximum value of $k$ that satisfies the inequality gives $k < 23$. Since $k$ must be an integer, the largest possible value for $k$ is $22$.\n\n## Step 10: Find the largest common value less than 500\nSubstituting $k = 22$ into $17 + 21k$ gives $17 + 21*22 = 17 + 462 = 479$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{479}$"
