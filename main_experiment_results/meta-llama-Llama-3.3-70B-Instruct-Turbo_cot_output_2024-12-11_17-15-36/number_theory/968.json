    "problem": "Three different natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors. How many factors does $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ have?",
    "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand what it means for a number to have exactly three factors.\nA number with exactly three factors must be a square of a prime number, because its factors will be 1, the prime number itself, and the square of the prime number.\n\n## Step 2: Break down x, y, and z based on the information from step 1.\nGiven that x, y, and z each have exactly three factors, we can represent them as squares of distinct prime numbers. Let's denote these prime numbers as p, q, and r. So, x = p^2, y = q^2, and z = r^2, where p, q, and r are distinct prime numbers.\n\n## Step 3: Express x^2y^3z^4 in terms of p, q, and r.\nSubstituting the expressions for x, y, and z from step 2 into x^2y^3z^4 gives us (p^2)^2 * (q^2)^3 * (r^2)^4 = p^4 * q^6 * r^8.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of factors of x^2y^3z^4.\nThe number of factors of any number represented in its prime factorization form, a^m * b^n * c^o, is calculated as (m+1)*(n+1)*(o+1), where a, b, and c are distinct prime numbers. Applying this formula to p^4 * q^6 * r^8, we get (4+1)*(6+1)*(8+1).\n\n## Step 5: Perform the multiplication to find the total number of factors.\n(4+1)*(6+1)*(8+1) = 5*7*9 = 315.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{315}$"
