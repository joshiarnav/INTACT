    "problem": "Natural numbers of the form $F_n=2^{2^n} + 1 $ are called Fermat numbers. In 1640, Fermat conjectured that all numbers $F_n$, where $n\\neq 0$, are prime. (The conjecture was later shown to be false.) What is the units digit of $F_{1000}$?",
    "solution": "Let's first try to find the cycle of units digits of $2^n$, starting with $n=1$: $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $2^n$ is 4 digits long: 2, 4, 8, 6. To find the units digit of $2^n$, for any positive integer $n$, we simply need to find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 2, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 4, etc.) Since $2^{1000}\\div4=2^{998}$ without remainder, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6. Therefore, the units digit of $F_n=2^{2^{1000}}+1$ is $6+1=\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the definition of Fermat numbers\nFermat numbers are defined as $F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the pattern of units digits of powers of 2\nTo find the units digit of $F_{1000}$, we need to find the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$. The units digit of powers of 2 follows a repeating pattern: 2, 4, 8, 6, and then repeats.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the exponent $2^{1000}$\nWe need to determine where $2^{1000}$ falls in the cycle of units digits of powers of 2. Since the cycle length is 4 (2, 4, 8, 6), we can find the remainder when $2^{1000}$ is divided by 4.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the remainder of $2^{1000}$ divided by 4\nSince $2^{1000}$ is a power of 2, we can simplify this step by recognizing that any even power of 2 (such as $2^{1000}$) is divisible by 4. Thus, $2^{1000} \\mod 4 = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$\nGiven that $2^{1000}$ is a multiple of 4, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ corresponds to the last step in the cycle (6), because $2^{1000}$ being a multiple of 4 indicates we're at a point in the cycle that's a multiple of 4 steps from the start, which always ends on the 6 in the pattern 2, 4, 8, 6.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the units digit of $F_{1000}$\nThe units digit of $F_{1000} = 2^{2^{1000}} + 1$ will be the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ (which we've determined to be 6) plus 1.\n\n## Step 7: Find the final units digit\n6 + 1 = 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
