    "solution": "In general, to express the number $0.\\overline{n}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $10x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&10x &=& n&.nnnnn\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.nnnnn\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&9x &=& n &\n\\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\\overline{n} = \\frac{n}{9}$.\n\nHence, our original problem reduces to computing $\\frac 39 + \\frac 29 = \\boxed{\\frac 59}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Express $0.\\overline{3}$ as a fraction\nLet $x = 0.\\overline{3}$. Multiplying both sides by 10 gives $10x = 3.\\overline{3}$. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives $9x = 3$, so $x = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n## Step 2: Express $0.\\overline{2}$ as a fraction\nLet $y = 0.\\overline{2}$. Multiplying both sides by 10 gives $10y = 2.\\overline{2}$. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives $9y = 2$, so $y = \\frac{2}{9}$.\n\n## Step 3: Add the fractions\nAdding $x$ and $y$ gives $\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9}$. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 9. So we can rewrite $\\frac{1}{3}$ as $\\frac{3}{9}$. Then, $\\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$"
