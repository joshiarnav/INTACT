    "solution": "The order of operations says that we must do the multiplication before we do the addition.  We get \\begin{align*}3\\cdot 9&=27,\\end{align*}\\begin{align*}4\\cdot 10&=40,\\end{align*}\\begin{align*}11\\cdot 3=33,\\end{align*}and \\begin{align*}3\\cdot 8&=24.\\end{align*}Now, substituting back into the original equation and using the properties of addition we get \\begin{align*}3\\cdot 9+4\\cdot 10+11\\cdot 3+3\\cdot 8&=27+40+33+24 \\\\ &=27+33+40+24 \\\\ &=60+40+24 \\\\ &=100+24 \\\\ &=\\boxed{124}.\\end{align*}",
