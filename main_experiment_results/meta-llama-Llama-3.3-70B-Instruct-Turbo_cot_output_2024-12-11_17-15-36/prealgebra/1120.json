    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To find the area of the shaded L-shaped region, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.\n## Step 2:  First, we can see that the L-shaped region is formed by two rectangles. One rectangle has sides of length 3 and 1, and the other rectangle has sides of length 1 and 4.\n## Step 3:  We can calculate the area of each rectangle separately and then add them together to find the total area of the L-shaped region.\n## Step 4:  The area of the first rectangle is $3 \\times 1 = 3$, and the area of the second rectangle is $1 \\times 4 = 4$.\n## Step 5:  Adding these areas together gives us the total area of the L-shaped region, which is $3 + 4 = 7$.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the area of the shaded L-shaped region is $\\boxed{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
