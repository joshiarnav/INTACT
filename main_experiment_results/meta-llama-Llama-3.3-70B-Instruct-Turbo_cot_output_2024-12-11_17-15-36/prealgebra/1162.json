    "problem": "Chloe wants to buy a hoodie that costs $\\$32.75$. She empties her wallet and finds she only has three $\\$10$ bills, eight quarters, and a pile of dimes. What is the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ represent the unknown number of dimes. Chloe's total amount of money is $$3(\\$10)+8(\\$.25)+n(\\$.10) \\ge \\$32.75.$$Simplifying gives  \\begin{align*}\n30+2+.10n &\\ge 32.75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\n.10n &\\ge .75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge \\frac{.75}{.10} \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge 7.5.\n\\end{align*}Chloe must have at least $\\boxed{8}$ dimes in her pile.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Chloe has from the $10 bills.\nChloe has three $10 bills, which amounts to $3 \\times 10 = 30$ dollars.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Chloe has from the quarters.\nChloe has eight quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25. So, the total amount from quarters is $8 \\times 0.25 = 2$ dollars.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the remaining amount needed to buy the hoodie after using the $10 bills and quarters.\nThe hoodie costs $32.75. Chloe has $30 from the $10 bills and $2 from the quarters, totaling $30 + 2 = 32$ dollars. The remaining amount needed is $32.75 - 32 = 0.75$ dollars.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the minimum number of dimes needed to cover the remaining amount.\nSince each dime is worth $0.10, to find the minimum number of dimes needed to cover $0.75, we divide $0.75 by $0.10. This gives $0.75 / 0.10 = 7.5$. Since we cannot have half a dime, Chloe needs to have at least 8 dimes to have enough money.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
