    "problem": "In a right triangle with integer length sides, the hypotenuse has length 39 units. How many units is the length of the shorter leg?",
    "solution": "Since they only ask for one length, you can assume that there's only one possible triangle.  Then, quickly note that $39 = 3\\cdot 13$, and that 5 - 12 - 13 is a Pythagorean triple.  Therefore, the shorter leg has length $\\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the Pythagorean Theorem\nThe Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle\"\n) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be expressed as \\(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\\), where \\(c\\) is the length of the hypotenuse, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the lengths of the other two sides.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to the Given Problem\nGiven that the hypotenuse \\(c = 39\\) units, we can substitute this into the Pythagorean Theorem equation to get \\(39^2 = a^2 + b^2\\). This simplifies to \\(1521 = a^2 + b^2\\).\n\n## Step 3: Determine the Possible Values of a and b\nSince we are dealing with integer lengths and we want to find the shorter leg, we need to find integer values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) that satisfy the equation \\(1521 = a^2 + b^2\\). Given that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be integers, and knowing that one leg will be shorter than the other, we look for factorizations of \\(1521\\) that can be expressed as a sum of two squares.\n\n## Step 4: Factorize 1521 and Find Potential Squares\nFactorizing \\(1521\\) yields \\(1521 = 3 \\times 507 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 169 = 3^2 \\times 13^2\\). Knowing that \\(169 = 13^2\\), we can look for combinations of squares that add up to \\(1521\\).\n\n## Step 5: Identify the Combination of Squares\nOne way to express \\(1521\\) as a sum of two squares is by recognizing that \\(1521 = 36^2 + 15^2\\), because \\(1296 + 225 = 1521\\). This step involves either knowing or figuring out the combinations of squares that sum to \\(1521\\), which can be done through trial and error or by using methods to decompose numbers into sums of squares.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the Shorter Leg\nFrom the combination \\(36^2 + 15^2 = 1521\\), the shorter leg is \\(15\\) units because \\(15 < 36\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
