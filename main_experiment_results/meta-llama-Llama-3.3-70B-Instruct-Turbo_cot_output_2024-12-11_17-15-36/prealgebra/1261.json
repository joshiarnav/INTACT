    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find a percentage of $x$ that equals $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$. This involves finding a specific percentage that represents a fraction of $x$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$\nFirst, calculate $50\\%$ of $x$, which is $0.5x$. Then, find $40\\%$ of $0.5x$, which is $0.4 \\times 0.5x = 0.2x$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the percentage that equals $0.2x$\nThe percentage we are looking for is the one that, when applied to $x$, gives $0.2x$. This means we are looking for $y\\%$ of $x$ such that $y\\% \\times x = 0.2x$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $y\\%$\nTo find $y\\%$, we set up the equation $y\\% \\times x = 0.2x$. Since $y\\% = \\frac{y}{100}$, we have $\\frac{y}{100} \\times x = 0.2x$. Simplifying, $y = 0.2 \\times 100 = 20$.\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion\nTherefore, $20\\%$ of $x$ is equal to $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$"
