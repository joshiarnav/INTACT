    "problem": "The average of the numbers 23 and $x$ is 27. What is the positive difference between 23 and $x$? (Recall that the average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2).",
    "solution": "To calculate the average of two numbers, we add them and divide the sum by $2$.  From the given information, we have the equation  \\[\\frac{23+x}{2}=27.\\]  Multiplying both sides by $2$ yields \\[23+x=54.\\]  Thus, $x=54-23=31$.  Finally, the positive difference between $31$ and $23$ is \\[31-23=\\boxed{8}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the concept of average\nThe average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2. So, the average of 23 and $x$ is $\\frac{23 + x}{2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Set up the equation based on the given information\nWe are given that the average of 23 and $x$ is 27. Therefore, we can set up the equation $\\frac{23 + x}{2} = 27$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the equation for $x$\nTo solve for $x$, we first multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: $23 + x = 54$. Then, we subtract 23 from both sides to isolate $x$: $x = 54 - 23$, which simplifies to $x = 31$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the positive difference between 23 and $x$\nThe positive difference between 23 and $x$ (which is 31) is $|23 - 31| = |31 - 23| = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
