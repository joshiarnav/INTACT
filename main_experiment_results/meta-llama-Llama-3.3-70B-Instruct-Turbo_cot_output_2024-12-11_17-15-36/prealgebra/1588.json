    "problem": "The product of three different positive integers is equal to $7^3$. What is the sum of the three integers?",
    "solution": "All three integers must be divisors of $7^3$.  The only divisors of $7^3$ are $7^0$, $7^1$, $7^2$, $7^3$.  We have $7^3=7^0\\times7^1\\times7^2$. Thus our answer is $7^0+7^1+7^2=1+7+49=\\boxed{57}$.",

    "model_solution": "##! Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find three different positive integers whose product equals $7^3$. Since $7^3 = 7 \\times 7 \\times 7$, the only factors of $7^3$ are $1, 7, 7^2, 7^3$.\n\n##! Step 2: Identify the integers\nTo have a product of $7^3$, the three integers must be $1, 7, 7^2$ because these are the only combination of three different factors that multiply to $7^3$.\n\n##! Step 3: Calculate the sum\nNow, we calculate the sum of these integers: $1 + 7 + 7^2$. Since $7^2 = 49$, the sum is $1 + 7 + 49$.\n\n##! Step 4: Perform the addition\nPerforming the addition: $1 + 7 + 49 = 57$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57}$"
