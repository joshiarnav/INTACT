    "solution": "The chart shows the amounts of sales at the end of each year.  Therefore we're looking for a year on the chart that has the largest difference from the previous year.    Determining the sales that increased the most number of dollars is equivalent to finding the right endpoint of the segment with the steepest slope.  From observation, we can determine that that line corresponds to the year $\\boxed{1998}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to determine the year after 1994 when the sales increased the most in terms of dollars. This means we need to find the year with the greatest difference in sales amount compared to the previous year.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the graph\nLooking at the graph, we can see that each point represents the end-of-year sales amount for each year. The x-axis represents the years, and the y-axis represents the sales amounts in millions of dollars.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the years and sales amounts\nFrom the graph, we can identify the years and their corresponding sales amounts:\n- 1994: 3 million dollars\n- 1996: 3.6 million dollars\n- 1998: 4.5 million dollars\n- 2000: 4.8 million dollars\n- 2002: 4.75 million dollars (approximate)\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the differences in sales amounts\nTo find the year with the greatest increase in sales, we need to calculate the differences in sales amounts between consecutive years:\n- 1996 - 1994: 3.6 - 3 = 0.6 million dollars\n- 1998 - 1996: 4.5 - 3.6 = 0.9 million dollars\n- 2000 - 1998: 4.8 - 4.5 = 0.3 million dollars\n- 2002 - 2000: 4.75 - 4.8 = -0.05 million dollars (decrease)\n\n## Step 5: Determine the year with the greatest increase\nBased on the calculations, the greatest increase in sales occurred between 1996 and 1998, with a difference of 0.9 million dollars. Therefore, the year after 1994 when sales increased the most is 1998.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1998}$"
