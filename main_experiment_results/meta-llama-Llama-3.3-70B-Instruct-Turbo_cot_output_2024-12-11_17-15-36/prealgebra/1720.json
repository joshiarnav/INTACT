    "problem": "Given three members of a group -- Alice, Bob, and Carol -- in how many ways can these three be chosen to be the three officers (president, secretary, and treasurer) of the group, assuming no person holds more than one job?",
    "solution": "In this problem we are choosing a committee, so the order in which we choose the 3 people does not matter.  We could have chosen them in any of the following orders (where A is Alice, B is Bob, and C is Carol): ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.  So each possible committee corresponds to $3! = \\boxed{6}$ possible orderings.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of choices for the president position\nThere are 3 members (Alice, Bob, and Carol) who can potentially be chosen as the president. So, there are 3 choices for this position.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of choices for the secretary position\nAfter selecting the president, there are 2 remaining members who can be chosen as the secretary. So, for each choice of president, there are 2 choices for the secretary position.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of choices for the treasurer position\nAfter selecting the president and the secretary, there is only 1 remaining member who can be chosen as the treasurer. So, for each combination of president and secretary, there is only 1 choice for the treasurer position.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways to choose the officers\nTo find the total number of ways, we multiply the number of choices for each position: 3 choices for president * 2 choices for secretary * 1 choice for treasurer = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
