    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and recall the relevant geometric properties.\nThe problem involves finding the sum of the areas of two squares, $ABCD$ and $AEFG$, given that angle $EAB$ is a right angle and $BE=9$ units. To approach this problem, we need to use the properties of right-angled triangles and the formula for the area of a square.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the relationship between the sides of the right triangle $BAE$.\nSince $EAB$ is a right angle, triangle $BAE$ is a right-angled triangle. According to the Pythagorean theorem, in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This gives us $AE^2 + AB^2 = BE^2$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate $AE^2 + AB^2$ using the given length of $BE$.\nWe are given that $BE = 9$ units. Applying the Pythagorean theorem, $AE^2 + AB^2 = 9^2 = 81$ square units.\n\n## Step 4: Recognize that $AE^2 + AB^2$ represents the sum of the areas of the squares $ABCD$ and $AEFG$.\nThe area of a square is given by the formula $side^2$. Therefore, the area of square $ABCD$ is $AB^2$ and the area of square $AEFG$ is $AE^2$. The sum of their areas is $AB^2 + AE^2$, which we have already found to be $81$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{81}$"
