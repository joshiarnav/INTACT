    "problem": "In order to compute the area of a particular circle, Juan first measures the length of its diameter. The actual diameter is 20 cm, but Juan's measurement has an error of up to $20\\%$. What is the largest possible percent error, in percent, in Juan's computed area of the circle?",
    "solution": "Juan can measure the diameter as a length anywhere between $20 - 20\\cdot 0.2 = 16$ and $20 + 20\\cdot 0.2 = 24$  cm. The actual area of the circle is $\\pi (20/2)^2=100\\pi$ square cm, but Juan can compute the area anywhere in the range $\\pi (16/2)^2=64 \\pi$ square cm to $\\pi (24/2)^2=144 \\pi$ square cm. Using the lower bound of the range, Juan's error is $(100\\pi - 64\\pi)/(100\\pi)=36\\%$. Using the upper bound of the range, Juan's error is $(144\\pi - 100\\pi)/(100\\pi)=44\\%$. Thus, the largest possible percent error is $\\boxed{44}$ percent.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the true area of the circle\nThe true area of the circle can be calculated using the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Given that the diameter is 20 cm, the radius is half of that, which is 10 cm. So, the true area is $A = \\pi (10)^2 = 100\\pi$ square centimeters.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the largest possible measured diameter\nJuan's measurement has an error of up to $20\\%$. The largest possible measured diameter would be $20 + 0.20 \\times 20 = 20 + 4 = 24$ cm.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the area based on the largest possible measured diameter\nUsing the largest possible measured diameter of 24 cm, the radius would be 12 cm. The area calculated from this measurement would be $A = \\pi (12)^2 = 144\\pi$ square centimeters.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the percent error in Juan's computation\nThe percent error can be calculated using the formula $\\left( \\frac{\\text{Calculated Area} - \\text{True Area}}{\\text{True Area}} \\right) \\times 100\\%$. Plugging in the values, we get $\\left( \\frac{144\\pi - 100\\pi}{100\\pi} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{44\\pi}{100\\pi} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 44\\%$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{44}$"
