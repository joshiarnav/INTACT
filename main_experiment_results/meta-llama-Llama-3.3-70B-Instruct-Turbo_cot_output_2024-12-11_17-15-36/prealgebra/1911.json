    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the possible equilateral triangle formations\nTo find equilateral triangles with all three vertices in the lattice, we should first identify the possible formations of equilateral triangles. An equilateral triangle has three equal sides and three equal angles, each measuring 60 degrees.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the side length of the equilateral triangles\nGiven that each point in the hexagonal lattice is one unit from its nearest neighbor, we can determine that the side length of the equilateral triangles can be either 1 unit or $\\sqrt{3}$ units, as these are the only two distances that can form equilateral triangles within the lattice.\n\n## Step 3: Count the number of equilateral triangles with a side length of 1 unit\nWe can see that there are six equilateral triangles with a side length of 1 unit, each formed by connecting three adjacent points in the lattice.\n\n## Step 4: Count the number of equilateral triangles with a side length of $\\sqrt{3}$ units\nThere are two equilateral triangles with a side length of $\\sqrt{3}$ units, each formed by connecting three points that are $\\sqrt{3}$ units apart.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of equilateral triangles\nTo find the total number of equilateral triangles, we add the number of triangles with a side length of 1 unit and the number of triangles with a side length of $\\sqrt{3}$ units.\n\n## Step 6: Add the number of equilateral triangles with a side length of 1 unit and $\\sqrt{3}$ units\nTotal number of equilateral triangles = 6 (1 unit) + 2 ($\\sqrt{3}$ units) = 8.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
