    "model_solution": "To find the number of prime numbers between 30 and 50, we need to identify which numbers in this range are prime. \n\nFirst, let's list the numbers between 30 and 50: 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49.\n\nNext, we'll go through each number and determine if it's prime. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n- 31 is prime.\n- 32 is not prime (divisible by 2, 4, 8, 16).\n- 33 is not prime (divisible by 3, 11).\n- 34 is not prime (divisible by 2, 17).\n- 35 is not prime (divisible by 5, 7).\n- 36 is not prime (divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18).\n- 37 is prime.\n- 38 is not prime (divisible by 2, 19).\n- 39 is not prime (divisible by 3, 13).\n- 40 is not prime (divisible by 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20).\n- 41 is prime.\n- 42 is not prime (divisible by 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21).\n- 43 is prime.\n- 44 is not prime (divisible by 2, 4, 11, 22).\n- 45 is not prime (divisible by 3, 5, 9, 15).\n- 46 is not prime (divisible by 2, 23).\n- 47 is prime.\n- 48 is not prime (divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24).\n- 49 is not prime (divisible by 7).\n\nThe prime numbers between 30 and 50 are 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 prime numbers between 30 and 50.\n\n$\\boxed{5}$"
