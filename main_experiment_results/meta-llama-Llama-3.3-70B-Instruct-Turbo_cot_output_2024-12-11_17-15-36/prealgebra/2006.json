    "solution": "We check what squares divide 245. None of the squares from $2^2$ to $6^2$ divides 245, but $7^2=49$ does. Dividing 245 by 49 gives 5, which has no square factors. So, $\\sqrt{245}=\\sqrt{49\\cdot5}=\\boxed{7\\sqrt{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To simplify $\\sqrt{245}$, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Find the prime factors of 245**: We start by finding the prime factors of 245 to see if there are any perfect squares that we can extract from the square root.\n\n2. **Prime factorization of 245**: \n   - Start by dividing 245 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. However, 245 is odd, so 2 won't be a factor.\n   - Move to the next prime number, which is 3. 245 is not divisible by 3.\n   - Continue with 5. 245 \u00f7 5 = 49. So, 245 = 5 * 49.\n   - Now, 49 is a perfect square because 49 = 7 * 7 or $7^2$.\n   - Therefore, 245 = 5 * $7^2$.\n\n3. **Simplify the square root**: \n   - Given that $\\sqrt{245} = \\sqrt{5 * 7^2}$, we can simplify this by taking the square root of $7^2$ which is 7, outside of the square root, leaving the 5 inside.\n   - So, $\\sqrt{245} = \\sqrt{5 * 7^2} = 7\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nTherefore, the simplified form of $\\sqrt{245}$ is $\\boxed{7\\sqrt{5}}$."
