    "problem": "If only one quarter of the earth's surface is not covered by bodies of water, and only one half of that exposed land area is inhabitable for humans (because of poles, deserts, etc.), what fraction of the earth's surface can humans live on?",
    "solution": "One half of one quarter of the earth is $\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{4}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the fraction of the earth's surface not covered by bodies of water.\nOne quarter of the earth's surface is not covered by bodies of water, so the fraction of the earth's surface not covered by bodies of water is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the fraction of the exposed land area that is inhabitable for humans.\nOnly one half of the exposed land area is inhabitable for humans, so the fraction of the exposed land area that is inhabitable for humans is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on.\nTo find the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on, we need to multiply the fraction of the earth's surface not covered by bodies of water by the fraction of the exposed land area that is inhabitable for humans. So, the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on is $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$"
