    "problem": "What is the greatest common multiple of 8 and 12 that is less than 90?",
    "solution": "Recall that the common multiples of a set of integers are precisely the multiples of the least common multiple of the set. In this case, the common multiples are integers of the form $24k$ (where $k$ is an integer), since 24 is the least common multiple of 8 and 12. Since $24(3)=72$ and $24(4)=96>90$, the greatest common multiple of 8 and 12 less than 90 is $\\boxed{72}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the multiples of 8 and 12\nFirst, we need to list the multiples of 8 and 12 to find their common multiples. Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88. Multiples of 12: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the common multiples of 8 and 12\nFrom the listed multiples, we identify the common multiples of 8 and 12, which are 24, 48, 72.\n\n## Step 3: Find the greatest common multiple less than 90\nAmong the common multiples (24, 48, 72), we need to find the greatest one that is less than 90.\n\n## Step 4: Select the greatest common multiple less than 90\nThe greatest common multiple of 8 and 12 that is less than 90 is 72.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{72}$"
