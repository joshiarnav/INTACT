    "problem": "If $x^2 = y - 3$ and $x = -5$, then what is the value of $y$?",
    "solution": "Substituting $-5$ for $x$ in the first equation, we have $(-5)^2 = y-3$.  So $25=y-3$. Adding $3$ to both sides, $y=\\boxed{28}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of \\(y\\), we first need to substitute the given value of \\(x\\) into the equation \\(x^2 = y - 3\\).\n\nGiven that \\(x = -5\\), we substitute \\(-5\\) for \\(x\\) in the equation:\n\n\\((-5)^2 = y - 3\\)\n\nNext, we calculate the square of \\(-5\\):\n\n\\((-5)^2 = 25\\)\n\nSo, the equation now becomes:\n\n\\(25 = y - 3\\)\n\nTo solve for \\(y\\), we need to isolate \\(y\\) on one side of the equation. We do this by adding \\(3\\) to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\(25 + 3 = y - 3 + 3\\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\(28 = y\\)\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(y\\) is \\(28\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{28}\\)"
