    "solution": "Recall that multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction. We get \\[\n6 \\div 3 - 2 - 8 + 2 \\cdot 8 = 2 - 2 - 8 + 16.\n\\]We rewrite the subtractions as additions of negations so we can rearrange:  \\begin{align*}\n2 - 2 - 8 + 16 &= 2 + (-2) + (-8) + 16 \\\\\n&= 16 + 2 + (-2) + (-8) \\\\\n&= 18 - (2+8) \\\\\n&= 18-10 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{8}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\nGiven the expression $6 \\div 3 - 2 - 8 + 2 \\cdot 8$, we start by performing the multiplication and division operations.\n\n## Step 2: Perform the division $6 \\div 3$.\n$6 \\div 3 = 2$.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the multiplication $2 \\cdot 8$.\n$2 \\cdot 8 = 16$.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute the results of the division and multiplication back into the expression.\nSo, $6 \\div 3 - 2 - 8 + 2 \\cdot 8$ becomes $2 - 2 - 8 + 16$.\n\n## Step 5: Now, perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right.\nStart with $2 - 2 = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Then, subtract 8 from the result.\n$0 - 8 = -8$.\n\n## Step 7: Finally, add 16 to the result.\n$-8 + 16 = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
