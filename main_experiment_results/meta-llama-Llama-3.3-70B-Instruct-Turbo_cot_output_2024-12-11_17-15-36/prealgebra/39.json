    "solution": "The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so we must have \\[\\angle M + \\angle A + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle S = 540^\\circ.\\] Since $\\angle A$ and $\\angle S$ are supplementary, we have $\\angle A +\\angle S = 180^\\circ$.  Combining this with $\\angle H = \\angle M = \\angle T$, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\angle M + \\angle A + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle S& =\n(\\angle M + \\angle T + \\angle H) \\\\\n&\\qquad+ (\\angle A +\\angle S) \\\\\n&= 3\\angle H + 180^\\circ,\\end{align*} so $3\\angle H + 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ$.  Therefore, $3\\angle H = 360^\\circ$ and $\\angle H = \\boxed{120^\\circ}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the sum of interior angles in a pentagon\nThe sum of interior angles in a pentagon is given by the formula $180(n-2)$, where $n$ is the number of sides. For a pentagon, $n = 5$, so the sum of interior angles is $180(5-2) = 180 \\times 3 = 540$ degrees.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the given angle relationships\nWe are given that $\\angle M \\cong \\angle T \\cong \\angle H$, meaning these three angles have the same measure. Let's denote this measure as $x$ degrees. Therefore, $\\angle M = \\angle T = \\angle H = x$.\n\n## Step 3: Understand the supplementary angles\nWe are also given that $\\angle A$ is supplementary to $\\angle S$. This means that $\\angle A + \\angle S = 180$ degrees.\n\n## Step 4: Set up the equation based on the sum of angles in a pentagon\nThe sum of all interior angles in the pentagon is 540 degrees. Using the information from steps 2 and 3, we can set up the equation: $x + \\angle A + x + \\angle S + x = 540$. Since $\\angle A + \\angle S = 180$, we can simplify this to $3x + 180 = 540$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the equation for $x$\nTo find the measure of $\\angle H$, which is $x$, we solve the equation $3x + 180 = 540$. Subtract 180 from both sides to get $3x = 360$. Then, divide both sides by 3 to get $x = 120$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{120}$"
