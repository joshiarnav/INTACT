    "problem": "Piravena must make a trip from $A$ to $B$, then from $B$ to $C$, then from $C$ to $A$.  Each of these three parts of the trip is made entirely by bus or entirely by airplane.  The cities form a right-angled triangle as shown, with $C$ a distance of 3000 km from $A$ and with $B$ a distance of 3250 km from $A$. To take a bus, it costs Piravena $\\$0.15$ per kilometer. To take an airplane, it costs her a $\\$100$ booking fee, plus $\\$0.10$ per kilometer.

    "solution": "Since $\\triangle ABC$ is a right-angled triangle, then we may use the Pythagorean Theorem.\nThus, $AB^2=BC^2+CA^2$, and so  \\begin{align*}\nBC^2&=AB^2-CA^2\\\\\n&=3250^2-3000^2\\\\\n&=250^2(13^2-12^2)\\\\\n&=250^2(5^2)\\\\\n&=1250^2.\n\\end{align*} therefore $BC=1250$ km (since $BC>0$).\nPiravena travels a distance of $3250+1250+3000=\\boxed{7500}$ km for her complete trip.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the distances between each city\nThe distance between $A$ and $C$ is given as 3000 km. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given as 3250 km.\n\n## Step 2: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between $B$ and $C$\nSince the cities form a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between $B$ and $C$. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem\nLet's denote the distance between $B$ and $C$ as $BC$. Using the Pythagorean theorem: $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2$. Plugging in the given values: $3250^2 = 3000^2 + BC^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $BC^2$\n$3250^2 = 10562500$ and $3000^2 = 9000000$. So, $10562500 = 9000000 + BC^2$. Solving for $BC^2$: $BC^2 = 10562500 - 9000000$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $BC^2$\n$BC^2 = 1562500$.\n\n## Step 6: Find $BC$\nTaking the square root of both sides to solve for $BC$: $BC = \\sqrt{1562500} = 1250$ km.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total distance traveled\nThe total distance traveled is the sum of the distances between $A$ and $B$, $B$ and $C$, and $C$ and $A$: $3250 + 1250 + 3000$.\n\n## Step 8: Add the distances together\n$3250 + 1250 + 3000 = 7500$ km.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7500}$"
