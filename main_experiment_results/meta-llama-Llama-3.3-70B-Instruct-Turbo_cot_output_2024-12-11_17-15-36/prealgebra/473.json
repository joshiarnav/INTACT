    "model_solution": "To round 18.4851 to the nearest hundredth, we need to look at the thousandth place, which is the third digit after the decimal point. \n\nThe number in the thousandth place is 5. Since 5 is greater than or equal to 5, we round up the digit in the hundredth place.\n\nSo, 18.4851 rounded to the nearest hundredth is 18.49.\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{18.49}$"
