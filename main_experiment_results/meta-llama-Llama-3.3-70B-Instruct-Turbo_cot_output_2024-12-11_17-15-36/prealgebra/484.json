    "problem": "A teacher has a class with $24$ students in it. If she wants to split the students into equal groups of at most $10$ students each, what is the least number of groups that she needs?",
    "solution": "For the teacher to be able to split her students into $x$ groups of $y$ students each, $y$ must be a divisor of $24$. Since we want to create as few groups as possible, we need to maximize the number of students in each group. Thus, $y$ should be the greatest divisor of $24$ that is less than or equal to $10$. This means that $y=8$ and $x=3$. The teacher can create $\\boxed{3}$ groups of $8$ students each.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least number of groups the teacher needs, we must divide the total number of students by the maximum number of students per group and then round up to the nearest whole number, because even if there's just one student left, it will still require a separate group.\n\n1. **Total number of students**: 24\n2. **Maximum students per group**: 10\n\nDivide the total number of students by the maximum students per group:\n24 / 10 = 2.4\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a group, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student is in a group.\n\nRounded up, 2.4 becomes 3.\n\nTherefore, the teacher needs at least **3** groups to accommodate all 24 students with no more than 10 students in each group.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
