    "problem": "The circular region of the sign (below, left) has an area of 154 square inches. Vanessa would like to place a tiny ribbon (shaded) around the circle's edge. To be sure she has enough ribbon, she decides to buy 2 inches more of the ribbon than the original circle's circumference. How many inches of ribbon will Vanessa need to buy if she estimates $\\pi = \\frac{22}{7}$?\n\n[asy]import graph;\nsize(125,72.5);\npicture p;\ndraw(p,unitsquare);\nfilldraw(p,Circle((.5,.5),.3),white);\nlabel(p,\"Enter\",(.5,.5),ZapfChancery(\"m\",\"n\"));\nadd(p);\nfilldraw(Circle((2,.5),.4),gray(.6));\nadd(shift(1.5*right)*p);\ndraw((1.1,.5)--(1.4,.5),EndArrow(5,25));[/asy]",
    "solution": "Say the radius of the circle is $r$. Then the area of the circle is $\\pi r^2,$ which we estimate to $154=\\frac{22}{7}r^2$. If we multiply both sides by $\\frac{7}{22}$, we get $r^2=49$ or $r=7$. The circle's circumference is $2\\pi r$, which we again estimate to $\\frac{44}{7}r=44$. Vanessa wants two extra inches of ribbon, so she needs to buy $44+2=\\boxed{46}$ inches of ribbon.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information\nThe problem describes a circular sign with an area of 154 square inches. Vanessa wants to buy a ribbon that is 2 inches longer than the circumference of the circle. We are asked to find the length of the ribbon she needs to buy, given that she estimates $\\pi = \\frac{22}{7}$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the formula for the area of a circle\nThe formula for the area of a circle is $A = \\pi r^2$, where $A$ is the area and $r$ is the radius of the circle. We can use this formula to find the radius of the circle.\n\n## Step 3: Use the given area to find the radius of the circle\nWe are given that the area of the circle is 154 square inches and $\\pi = \\frac{22}{7}$. Substituting these values into the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, we get $154 = \\frac{22}{7}r^2$. Now we can solve for $r$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for the radius of the circle\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $\\frac{7}{22}$, we get $r^2 = 154 \\times \\frac{7}{22} = 49$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find $r = 7$ inches.\n\n## Step 5: Recall the formula for the circumference of a circle\nThe formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = 2\\pi r$, where $C$ is the circumference and $r$ is the radius of the circle. We can use this formula to find the circumference of the circle.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the circumference of the circle\nSubstituting the value of $r$ and the estimated value of $\\pi$ into the formula $C = 2\\pi r$, we get $C = 2 \\times \\frac{22}{7} \\times 7 = 44$ inches.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the length of the ribbon needed\nVanessa wants to buy a ribbon that is 2 inches longer than the circumference of the circle. Therefore, the length of the ribbon she needs to buy is $44 + 2 = 46$ inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{46}$"
