    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given equation in words\nThe problem states that one-half of one-seventh of $T$ equals one-third of one-fifth of 90. We need to translate this into a mathematical equation.\n\n## Step 2: Translate the word equation into a mathematical equation\nOne-half of one-seventh of $T$ can be written as $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{7} \\times T = \\frac{T}{14}$.\nOne-third of one-fifth of 90 can be written as $\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{5} \\times 90 = \\frac{90}{15} = 6$.\nSo, the equation becomes $\\frac{T}{14} = 6$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the equation for $T$\nTo solve for $T$, we multiply both sides of the equation by 14 to isolate $T$.\n$\\frac{T}{14} \\times 14 = 6 \\times 14$.\nThis simplifies to $T = 84$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{84}$"
