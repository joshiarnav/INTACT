    "problem": "A zoo has a menagerie containing four pairs of different animals, one male and one female for each. The zookeeper wishes to feed the animals in a specific pattern: each time he feeds a single animal, the next one he feeds must be a different gender. If he starts by feeding the male giraffe, how many ways can he feed all the animals?",
    "solution": "If the zookeeper starts with the male giraffe, there are 4 females which he can feed next. Once one is selected, there are 3 males he can feed next, then 3 females, 2 males, 2 females, 1 male, and 1 female.\n\nThe total number of possibilities is $4\\times3\\times3\\times2\\times2 = \\boxed{144}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of animals and their genders.\nThere are four pairs of different animals, meaning there are 4 males and 4 females, totaling 8 animals.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the pattern of feeding based on gender.\nThe zookeeper must alternate the gender of the animals each time he feeds one. Since he starts with a male, the pattern will be male-female-male-female and so on, until all animals are fed.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of choices at each step of feeding.\n- For the first feeding, the choice is already made (male giraffe), so there's 1 way to do this.\n- For the second feeding, he must choose a female, and there are 4 females to choose from.\n- For the third feeding, he must choose a male, and there are 3 males left to choose from (since the giraffe has already been fed).\n- For the fourth feeding, he must choose a female, and there are 3 females left.\n- For the fifth feeding, he must choose a male, and there are 2 males left.\n- For the sixth feeding, he must choose a female, and there are 2 females left.\n- For the seventh feeding, he must choose a male, and there's 1 male left.\n- For the eighth feeding, he must choose a female, and there's 1 female left.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways to feed the animals based on the choices at each step.\nThe total number of ways is the product of the choices at each step: 1 (for the first male) * 4 (females to choose from) * 3 (males left) * 3 (females left) * 2 (males left) * 2 (females left) * 1 (male left) * 1 (female left).\n\n## Step 5: Perform the multiplication to find the total number of ways.\n1 * 4 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 144.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{144}$"
