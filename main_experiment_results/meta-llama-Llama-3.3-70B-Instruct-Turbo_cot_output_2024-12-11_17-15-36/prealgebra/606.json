    "problem": "An equilateral triangle has sides of length 2 units. A second equilateral triangle is formed having sides that are $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the first triangle. A third equilateral triangle is formed having sides that are $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the second triangle. The process is continued until four equilateral triangles exist. What will be the percent increase in the perimeter from the first triangle to the fourth triangle? Express your answer to the nearest tenth.",
    "solution": "If the side length of each successive equilateral triangle is $150\\%$ of the previous triangle, then we can multiply the previous side length by 1.5. We will need to do this three times to get to the fourth triangle, so its side length will be $$1.5^3 = 1.5 \\times 1.5 \\times 1.5 = 3.375$$ times the  original side length. This is the same as $337.5\\%$ of the original side length, which represents a $337.5 - 100 = 237.5\\%$ increase over the original side length. The perimeter is also a length, so it will be affected in the same way. The percent increase in the perimeter is $\\boxed{237.5\\%}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the side length of the second equilateral triangle.\nThe second triangle's sides are $150\\%$ of the first triangle's sides. Since the first triangle has sides of 2 units, the second triangle's sides will be $2 * 1.5 = 3$ units.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the side length of the third equilateral triangle.\nThe third triangle's sides are $150\\%$ of the second triangle's sides. Since the second triangle has sides of 3 units, the third triangle's sides will be $3 * 1.5 = 4.5$ units.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the side length of the fourth equilateral triangle.\nThe fourth triangle's sides are $150\\%$ of the third triangle's sides. Since the third triangle has sides of 4.5 units, the fourth triangle's sides will be $4.5 * 1.5 = 6.75$ units.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the perimeter of the first equilateral triangle.\nThe perimeter of an equilateral triangle is $3 * side length$. For the first triangle, the perimeter is $3 * 2 = 6$ units.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the perimeter of the fourth equilateral triangle.\nFor the fourth triangle, the perimeter is $3 * 6.75 = 20.25$ units.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the percent increase in the perimeter from the first! triangle to the fourth triangle.\nThe percent increase is given by the formula $\\frac{(New - Old)}{Old} * 100$. Substituting the values, we get $\\frac{(20.25 - 6)}{6} * 100 = \\frac{14.25}{6} * 100 = 2.375 * 100 = 237.5\\%$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{237.5}$"
