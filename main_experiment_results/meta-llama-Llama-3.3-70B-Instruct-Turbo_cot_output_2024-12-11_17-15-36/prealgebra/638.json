    "problem": "A car travels 40 kph for 20 kilometers, 50 kph for 25 kilometers, 60 kph for 45 minutes and 48 kph for 15 minutes. What is the average speed of the car, in kph?",
    "solution": "To find the average speed for the entire trip, we need to divide the total distance by the total time.  Remembering that $d=r\\cdot t$, and looking at each of the four parts of the trip, these pieces can be determined.\n\nFirst, a car traveling at 40 kph for 20 km will be traveling for $20/40=.5$ hours.  Next, a car traveling at 50 kph for 25 km will be traveling for $25/50=.5$ hours.  Next, a car traveling at 60 kph for 45 minutes (.75 hours) will travel a total of $60\\times .75=45$ km during that time.  Finally, a car traveling 48 kph for 15 minutes (.25 hours) will travel a total of $48\\times .25=12$ km.\n\nThe total distance traveled was $20+25+45+12=102$ km.  The total time was $.5+.5+.75+.25=2$ hours.  Therefore, the average speed of the car was $102/2=\\boxed{51}$ kph.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the time taken to travel 20 kilometers at 40 kph\nTo find the time taken, we use the formula: time = distance / speed. So, time = 20 km / 40 kph = 0.5 hours.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the time taken to travel 25 kilometers at 50 kph\nUsing the same formula, time = distance / speed, we get: time = 25 km / 50 kph = 0.5 hours.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled at 60 kph for 45 minutes\nFirst, we convert 45 minutes to hours: 45 minutes = 45 / 60 = 0.75 hours. Then, using the formula distance = speed * time, we find: distance = 60 kph * 0.75 hours = 45 km.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled at 48 kph for 15 minutes\nWe convert 15 minutes to hours: 15 minutes = 15 / 60 = 0.25 hours. Then, using the formula distance = speed * time, we get: distance = 48 kph * 0.25 hours = 12 km.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total distance traveled\nAdding up all the distances: total distance = 20 km + 25 km + 45 km + 12 km = 102 km.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total time taken\nAdding up all the times: total time = 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours + 0.75 hours + 0.25 hours = 2 hours.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the average speed\nThe average speed is calculated using the formula: average speed = total distance / total time. So, average speed = 102 km / 2 hours = 51 kph.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{51}$"
