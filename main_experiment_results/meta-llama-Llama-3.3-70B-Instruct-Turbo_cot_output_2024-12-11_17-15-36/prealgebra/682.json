    "problem": "If $\\frac{5}{33}$ is expressed in decimal form, what digit is in the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point?",
    "solution": "When we write $\\frac{5}{33}$ as a decimal using long division, we get $0.\\overline{15}=0.15151515\\ldots$. Notice the pattern we have here: if $n$ is odd, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal point is $1$; if $n$ is even, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal place is $5$. Since $92$ is an even number, the digit at the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point is $\\boxed{5}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Convert the fraction to decimal form\nTo find the digit in the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point, we first need to convert the fraction $\\frac{5}{33}$ into its decimal form.\n\n## Step 2: Perform long division to convert the fraction\nPerforming long division, we divide 5 by 33. The result of this division is a repeating decimal.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the repeating pattern\nThe long division of 5 by 33 yields a repeating decimal $0.151515...$ where the pattern \"15\" repeats indefinitely.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the position of the digit in the repeating pattern\nSince the pattern \"15\" is 2 digits long, we need to find where the 92nd digit falls within this repeating sequence.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the position within the pattern\nTo find the position within the pattern, we take the 92nd position and subtract 1 (since the first digit is in the 1st position, not the 0th), then divide by the length of the pattern (2) and look at the remainder. The remainder tells us which digit in the pattern is in the 92nd place.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the remainder\n92nd position minus 1 is 91. Dividing 91 by 2 gives a quotient of 45 with a remainder of 1.\n\n## Step 7: Identify the digit\nSince the remainder is 1, the digit in the 92nd place corresponds to the first digit in the repeating pattern \"15\", which is \"1\".\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
