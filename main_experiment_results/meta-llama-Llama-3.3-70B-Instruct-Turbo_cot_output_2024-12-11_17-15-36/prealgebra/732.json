    "problem": "Amanda, Ben, and Carlos share a sum of money. Their portions are in the ratio of 1:2:7, respectively. If Amanda's portion is $\\$$20, what is the total amount of money shared?",
    "solution": "We multiply each part of the ratio $1:2:7$ by 20 to make Amanda's part equal 20, and we have \\[1:2:7 = 1\\cdot 20:2\\cdot 20 :7\\cdot 20 = 20:40:140.\\] This means that  Ben's share is $2\\times 20 = 40$ dollars and Carlos's share is $7\\times 20=140$ dollars.  Therefore, the total amount of money shared is $20+40+140=\\boxed{200}$ dollars.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given ratio of the portions\nThe portions of Amanda, Ben, and Carlos are in the ratio of 1:2:7, respectively. This means that for every 1 part Amanda gets, Ben gets 2 parts, and Carlos gets 7 parts.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the value of one part of the ratio\nGiven that Amanda's portion is $\\$$20 and her ratio is 1, we can determine that one part of the ratio is equal to $\\$$20.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of parts in the ratio\nTo find the total amount of money shared, we need to calculate the total number of parts in the ratio. The total number of parts is 1 (Amanda's part) + 2 (Ben's parts) + 7 (Carlos' parts) = 10 parts.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money shared\nSince one part of the ratio is $\\$$20, the total amount of money shared can be calculated by multiplying the value of one part by the total number of parts. Total amount = 10 parts * $\\$$20/part = $\\$$200.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{200}$"
