    "problem": "How many diagonals does a convex polygon with 23 sides have?",
    "solution": "If the polygon has 23 sides, then it has 23 vertices. A diagonal is created by choosing 2 non-adjacent vertices and connecting them. First we choose a vertex. There are 23 choices. Then we choose another vertex that is not adjacent to the one we already chose. There are 20 choices for this. However, we have double counted all the diagonals, so the number of diagonals is $\\frac{23 \\cdot 20}{2}=23 \\cdot 10=\\boxed{230} \\text{ diagonals}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the formula for calculating the number of diagonals in a convex polygon\nThe formula to calculate the number of diagonals in a convex polygon is given by \\(d = \\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of sides of the polygon.\n\n## Step 2: Plug in the value of n into the formula\nGiven that the polygon has 23 sides, we substitute \\(n = 23\\) into the formula.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the calculation\nSubstituting \\(n = 23\\) into the formula \\(d = \\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\\), we get \\(d = \\frac{23(23-3)}{2}\\).\n\n## Step 4: Simplify and solve the equation\nSimplifying inside the parentheses first, we get \\(d = \\frac{23 \\times 20}{2}\\).\n\n## Step 5: Continue simplifying\nMultiplying \\(23 \\times 20\\), we get \\(460\\), so the equation becomes \\(d = \\frac{460}{2}\\).\n\n## Step 6: Final calculation\nDividing \\(460\\) by \\(2\\), we find \\(d = 230\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{230}$"
