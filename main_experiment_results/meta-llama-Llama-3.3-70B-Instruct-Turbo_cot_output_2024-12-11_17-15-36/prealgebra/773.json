    "problem": "If $x$ is a positive multiple of 8 and $x^2>100$, but $x<20$, what is $x$?",
    "solution": "This question gives multiple clues on what $x$ could be. Because $x^2>100$, we know that $x$ must be greater than 10, but $x$ is also less than 20. So $x$ is a multiple of 8 that is between 10 and 20. The only value that fits this description is $\\boxed{16}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the conditions given for x\nThe problem states that $x$ is a positive multiple of 8, $x^2 > 100$, and $x < 20$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the inequality $x^2 > 100$\nTo solve $x^2 > 100$, we take the square root of both sides, remembering to consider both the positive and negative square roots due to the nature of inequalities involving squares. This gives us $x > 10$ or $x < -10$. However, since $x$ is defined as a positive multiple of 8, we only consider $x > 10$.\n\n## Step 3: Combine the conditions $x > 10$ and $x < 20$\nCombining these conditions, we find that $x$ must be greater than 10 but less than 20.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the multiples of 8 within the range $10 < x < 20$\nThe positive multiples of 8 within this range are 16.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the value of $x$\nGiven that $x$ must be a multiple of 8, greater than 10, less than 20, and considering the squared condition is automatically satisfied by any $x$ greater than 10, we find $x = 16$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$"
