    "problem": "Only nine out of the original thirteen colonies had to ratify the U.S. Constitution in order for it to take effect. What is this ratio, nine to thirteen, rounded to the nearest tenth?",
    "solution": "Note that $\\frac{7.8}{13} = 0.6$ and $\\frac{9.1}{13} = 0.7.$ Since $\\frac{9}{13}$ is closer to $\\frac{9.1}{13}$ than to $\\frac{7.8}{13},$ $\\frac{9}{13}$ rounds to $\\boxed{0.7}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the ratio of nine to thirteen, we need to divide nine by thirteen.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate the ratio\nThe ratio is calculated by dividing the number of colonies required to ratify the Constitution (9) by the total number of original colonies (13). ratio = 9 / 13 = 0.6923077.\n\n## Step 2: Round the ratio to the nearest tenth\nWe need to round the calculated ratio to the nearest tenth. The ratio rounded to the nearest tenth is 0.7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.7}$"
