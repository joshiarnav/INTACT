    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 3 and 6\nTo find the GCF of 3 and 6, we need to identify the largest number that divides both 3 and 6 without leaving a remainder. The factors of 3 are 1 and 3, and the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Therefore, the greatest common factor is 3.\n\n## Step 2: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 6\nTo find the LCM of 3 and 6, we need to identify the smallest number that is a multiple of both 3 and 6. The multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, ... and the multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, ... . Therefore, the least common multiple is 6.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the sum of the GCF and LCM\nNow, we add the GCF and LCM together to get the sum. sum = GCF + LCM = 3 + 6 = 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$"
