    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the area of $\\Delta ABC$, we first need to identify key properties of the given triangle and use the information provided about the altitude $CD$.\nGiven that $CD = \\sqrt{3}$ centimeters and $\\angle A = 30^{\\circ}$, we can use trigonometric relationships to determine the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize that $\\Delta ACD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle because $\\angle A = 30^{\\circ}$ and $CD$ is perpendicular to $AC$, making $CD$ the shorter leg of the triangle.\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are! in the ratio $1 : \\sqrt{3} : 2$. Since $CD = \\sqrt{3}$, this corresponds to the side opposite the $60^{\\circ}$ angle, meaning $AC = 2CD = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n## Step 3: Now, we need to find the length of $BC$ to calculate the area of $\\Delta ABC$.\nGiven that $\\Delta ABC$ is also a 30-60-90 triangle (since $\\angle A = 30^{\\circ}$), and knowing $AC = 2\\sqrt{3}$, we can determine $BC$. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the $30^{\\circ}$ angle (which would be $BC$ in this case) is half the length of the hypotenuse. However, we actually need to directly calculate $BC$ using the properties of 30-60-90 triangles and the fact that $AC = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n## Step 4: Since $AC$ is the side opposite the $60^{\\circ}$ angle, $BC$ will be the side opposite the $30^{\\circ}$ angle, and thus $BC = 2$ because in a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of sides is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$ and $AC$ corresponds to the $\\sqrt{3}$ side, implying the hypotenuse ($AB$) would be $2\\sqrt{3}$ and $BC$ would be $2$.\nThis step corrects the logic to properly apply the 30-60-90 triangle ratios to find $BC$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the area of $\\Delta ABC$ using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\nThe base of $\\Delta ABC$ is $BC = 2$ and the height is $AC = 2\\sqrt{3}$ because $AC$ is perpendicular to $BC$ in a 30-60-90 triangle.\n\n## Step 6: Plug in the values into the area formula.\nArea $= \\frac{1}{2} \\times BC \\times AC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2\\sqrt{3} = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{3}}$"
