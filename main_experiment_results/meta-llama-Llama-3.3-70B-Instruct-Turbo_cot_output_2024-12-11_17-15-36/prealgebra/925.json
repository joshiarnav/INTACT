    "problem": "A number in the set $\\{50, 51, 52, 53, ... , 999\\}$ is randomly selected. What is the probability that it is a two-digit number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "To count the number of numbers in this set, we subtract 49 from all of the numbers, giving the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 950 \\}$, making it obvious that there are 950 numbers total. Furthermore, the set $\\{ 50, 51, 52, \\ldots, 98, 99 \\}$ corresponds to the more easily counted $\\{ 1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 49, 50 \\}$ by subtracting 49. So, the probability of selecting a two-digit number is $\\frac{50}{950} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the total set of numbers\nThe set of numbers is given as $\\{50, 51, 52, 53, ... , 999\\}$. To find the total count of numbers in this set, we subtract the starting number from the ending number and then add 1. Since the numbers are consecutive and include both the starting and ending numbers, the total count of numbers is $999 - 50 + 1 = 950$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the subset of two-digit numbers\nThe two-digit numbers within the set start at 50 and go up to 99. To find the count of two-digit numbers, we subtract the starting number of the two-digit sequence from the ending number of that sequence and then add 1. Thus, the count of two-digit numbers is $99 - 50 + 1 = 50$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of selecting a two-digit number\nThe probability of selecting a two-digit number from the given set is the count of two-digit numbers divided by the total count of numbers in the set. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{50}{950}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the fraction\nTo simplify the fraction $\\frac{50}{950}$, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 50 and 950. The GCD is 50. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 50 gives $\\frac{1}{19}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$"
