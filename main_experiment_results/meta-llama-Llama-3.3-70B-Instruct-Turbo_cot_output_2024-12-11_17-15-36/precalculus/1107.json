    "problem": "One line is parameterized by\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} -1 + s \\\\ 3 - ks \\\\ 1 + ks \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Another line is parameterized by\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} t/2 \\\\ 1 + t \\\\ 2 - t \\end{pmatrix}.\\]If the lines are coplanar (i.e. there is a plane that contains both lines), then find $k.$",
    "solution": "First, we check if the two lines can intersect.  For the two lines to intersect, we must have\n\\begin{align*}\n-1 + s &= \\frac{t}{2}, \\\\\n3 - ks &= 1 + t, \\\\\n1 + ks &= 2 - t.\n\\end{align*}Adding the second equation and third equation, we get $4 = 3,$ contradiction.  Thus, the two lines cannot intersect.\n\nSo for the two lines to be coplanar, the only other possibility is that they are parallel.  For the two lines to be parallel, their direction vectors must be proportional.  The direction vectors of the lines are $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -k \\\\ k \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix},$ respectively.  These vectors are proportional when\n\\[2 = -k.\\]Hence, $k = \\boxed{-2}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Two lines are coplanar if and only if their direction vectors are parallel or one is a multiple of the other.\nTo find the direction vectors of the lines, we look at the coefficients of s and t in their parameterizations. The direction vector of the first line is \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -k \\\\ k \\end{pmatrix},\\] and the direction vector of the second line is \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\n\n## Step 2: For the two lines to be coplanar, their direction vectors must be parallel or one must be a scalar multiple of the other.\nThis means we are looking for a scalar $c$ such that \\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -k \\\\ k \\end{pmatrix} = c \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\\] Comparing components, we get the equations $1 = \\frac{1}{2}c$, $-k = c$, and $k = -c$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the system of equations to find $k$.\nFrom the first equation, $c = 2$. Substituting $c = 2$ into the second equation, we get $-k = 2$, which implies $k = -2$. The third equation gives the same result, confirming that $k = -2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-2}$"
