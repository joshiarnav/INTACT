This means that all the edges of the tetrahedron have the same length, and all the faces are equilateral triangles.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the length of the edges of the tetrahedron\nTo find the length of the edges, we can use the distance formula in 3D space, which is given by $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2}$. Let's calculate the distances between the given vertices:\n- Distance between $(0,1,2)$ and $(4,2,1)$: $\\sqrt{(4-0)^2+(2-1)^2+(1-2)^2} = \\sqrt{16+1+1} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n- Distance between $(0,1,2)$ and $(3,1,5)$: $\\sqrt{(3-0)^2+(1-1)^2+(5-2)^2} = \\sqrt{9+0+9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n- Distance between $(4,2,1)$ and $(3,1,5)$: $\\sqrt{(3-4)^2+(1-2)^2+(5-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1+1+16} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nAll the distances are equal, confirming that the three points are vertices of a regular tetrahedron.\n\n## Step 3: Find the fourth vertex\nThe fourth vertex must be equidistant from the three given vertices. Let the coordinates of the fourth vertex be $(x,y,z)$. Using the distance formula, we can set up equations based on the fact that the distance from $(x,y,z)$ to each of the given vertices is $3\\sqrt{2}$.\n- Distance from $(x,y,z)$ to $(0,1,2)$: $\\sqrt{(x-0)^2+(y-1)^2+(z-2)^2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n- Distance from $(x,y,z)$ to $(4,2,1)$: $\\sqrt{(x-4)^2+(y-2)^2+(z-1)^2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n- Distance from $(x,y,z)$ to $(3,1,5)$: $\\sqrt{(x-3)^2+(y-1)^2+(z-5)^2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nSquaring both sides of each equation to eliminate the square root gives:\n- $x^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-2)^2 = 18$.\n- $(x-4)^2 + (y-2)^2 + (z-1)^2 = 18$.\n- $(x-3)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-5)^2 = 18$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the system of equations\nExpanding each equation:\n- $x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2 - 4z + 4 = 18$ simplifies to $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2y - 4z - 13 = 0$.\n- $x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2 - 4y + 4 + z^2 - 2z + 1 = 18$ simplifies to $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 8x - 4y - 2z + 3 = 0$.\n- $x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2 - 10z + 25 = 18$ simplifies to $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 6x - 2y - 10z + 17 = 0$.\nSubtracting the first equation from the second and third equations to eliminate $x^2$, $y^2$, and $z^2$:\n- Subtracting the first equation from the second equation gives $-8x - 4y - 2z + 3 - (-2y - 4z - 13) = 0$, which simplifies to $-8x - 2z + 16 = 0$.\n- Subtracting the first equation from the third equation gives $-6x - 2y - 10z + 17 - (-2y - 4z - 13) = 0$, which simplifies to $-6x - 6z + 30 = 0$.\nSimplifying these equations further:\n- $-8x - 2z = -16$.\n- $-6x - 6z = -30$.\nDividing the second equation by -6 to simplify gives $x + z = 5$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for x and z\nWe have two simplified equations:\n- $-8x - 2z = -16$.\n- $x + z = 5$.\nFrom the second equation, we can express $z$ as $z = 5 - x$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n- $-8x - 2(5 - x) = -16$.\n- $-8x - 10 + 2x = -16$.\n- $-6x = -6$.\n- $x = 1$.\nThen, substituting $x = 1$ into $x + z = 5$ gives $1 + z = 5$, so $z = 4$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for y\nSubstitute $x = 1$ and $z = 4$ back into one of the original equations to solve for $y$. Using $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2y - 4z - 13 = 0$:\n- $1^2 + y^2 + 4^2 - 2y - 4*4 - 13 = 0$.\n- $1 + y^2 + 16 - 2y - 16 - 13 = 0$.\n- $y^2 - 2y - 12 = 0$.\n- $(y - 4)(y + 3) = 0$.\nSo, $y = 4$ or $y = -3$. Since we are looking for integer coordinates and the problem involves a regular tetrahedron with specific given vertices, we need to ensure the solution is consistent with the geometry of the problem.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the correct value of y\nGiven the geometry of a regular tetrahedron and the fact that the distances between the given vertices and the fourth vertex must be equal, we should consider which of the potential $y$ values ($4$ or $-3$) would result in a valid tetrahedron with integer coordinates. The correct $y$ value must satisfy the condition that the fourth vertex is equidistant from the three given vertices and that all coordinates are integers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(1,4,4)}$"
