    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Analyzing the given equations\nWe start by examining the given equations: $a^3 b^5 = 1$ and $a^7 b^2 = 1$. Our goal is to find the number of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of complex numbers satisfying these equations.\n\n## Step 2: Manipulating the equations\nFrom the equation $a^3 b^5 = 1$, we can raise both sides to the power of 2 to get $a^6 b^{10} = 1$. Similarly, from the equation $a^7 b^2 = 1$, we can raise both sides to the power of 5 to get $a^{35} b^{10} = 1$.\n\n## Step 3: Deriving a relationship between $a$ and $b$\nDividing the equation $a^{35} b^{10} = 1$ by the equation $a^6 b^{10} = 1$, we obtain $a^{29} = 1$. This implies that $a$ must be a 29th root of unity.\n\n## Step 4: Finding the possible values of $b$\nSubstituting $a^{29} = 1$ into the equation $a^7 b^2 = 1$, we can solve for $b$. This yields $b^2 = a^{22}$, and further simplification gives $b = a^{11}$, as $a^{29} = 1$ implies that $a^{11}$ is the square root of $a^{22}$.\n\n## Step 5: Determining the number of ordered pairs\nGiven that $a$ must be a 29th root of unity, there are 29 possible values for $a$. For each value of $a$, there is a corresponding value of $b$ such that $b = a^{11}$. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ is equal to the number of possible values of $a$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{29}$"
