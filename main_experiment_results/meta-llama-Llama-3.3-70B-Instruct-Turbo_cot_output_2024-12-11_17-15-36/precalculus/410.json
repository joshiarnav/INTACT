    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the direction vectors of the two lines\nThe direction vector of the first line is given by $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and the direction vector of the second line is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the condition for two lines to be perpendicular\nFor two lines to be perpendicular, the dot product of their direction vectors must be equal to zero. This means that $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the dot product of the direction vectors\nThe dot product of the direction vectors is $a(1) - 2(3/2) + 1(2) = a - 3 + 2 = a - 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Set the dot product equal to zero and solve for $a$\nTo find the value of $a$ such that the lines are perpendicular, we set the dot product equal to zero: $a - 1 = 0$. Solving for $a$ gives $a = 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
