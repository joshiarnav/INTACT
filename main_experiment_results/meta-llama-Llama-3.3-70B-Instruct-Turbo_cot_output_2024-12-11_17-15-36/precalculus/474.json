    "problem": "What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that all the roots of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity?",
    "solution": "Multiplying the equation $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ by $z^2 + 1$, we get $z^6 + 1 = 0$.  Multiplying this equation by $z^6 - 1 = 0$, we get $z^{12} - 1 = 0$.  Therefore, every root of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ is a $12^{\\text{th}}$ root of unity.\n\nWe can factor $z^{12} - 1 = 0$ as\n\\[(z^6 - 1)(z^6 + 1) = (z^6 - 1)(z^2 + 1)(z^4 - z^2 + 1) = 0.\\]The $12^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity are $e^{0}$, $e^{2 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{4 \\pi i/12}$, $\\dots$, $e^{22 \\pi i/12}$.  We see that $e^{0}$, $e^{4 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{8 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{12 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{16 \\pi i/12}$, and $e^{20 \\pi i/12}$ are the roots of $z^6 - 1 = 0$.  Also, $e^{6 \\pi i/12} = e^{\\pi i/2} = i$ and $e^{18 \\pi i/12} = e^{3 \\pi i/2} = -i$ are the roots of $z^2 + 1 = 0$.  Thus, the roots of\n\\[z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0\\]are the remaining four $12^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity, namely $e^{2 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{10 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{14 \\pi i/12}$, and $e^{22 \\pi i/12}$.  The complex number $e^{2 \\pi i/12}$ is a primitive $12^{\\text{th}}$ root of unity, so by definition, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $(e^{2 \\pi i/12})^n = 1$ is 12.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a polynomial equation $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ and we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that all the roots of this equation are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the roots of the given equation\nTo find the roots, we can start by making a substitution. Let $y = z^2$, then the equation becomes $y^2 - y + 1 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula: $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. In this case, $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = 1$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the quadratic formula\nSubstituting the values into the quadratic formula, we get $y = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{-3} = i\\sqrt{3}$, the roots in! terms of $y$ are $y! = \\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Express roots in terms of $z$\nRecall that $y = z^2$. So, $z^2 = \\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The roots of $z$ can be found by taking the square root of both sides, which leads to $z = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the roots of unity\nThe roots of unity are complex numbers that, when raised to a positive integer power $n$, yield 1. In this case, we need to determine $n$ such that all roots of the given equation are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the roots\nThe expression $\\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ represents the complex cube roots of unity (excluding 1). When we take the square root of these values, we get the 6th roots of unity (excluding $\\pm 1$), because the square root of a cube root of unity is a 6th root of unity.\n\n## Step 7: Determine $n$\nGiven that the roots of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ correspond to the 6th roots of unity (excluding $\\pm 1$), the smallest positive integer $n$ for which all these roots are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity is $n = 12$, because the 12th roots of unity include all the 6th roots of unity, and the equation's roots are a subset of the 12th roots of unity.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
