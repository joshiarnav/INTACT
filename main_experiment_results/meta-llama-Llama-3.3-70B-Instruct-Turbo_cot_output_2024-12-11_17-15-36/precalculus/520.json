    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding Spherical Coordinates\nIn spherical coordinates, a point in space is represented by three quantities: \\(\\rho\\), \\(\\theta\\), and \\(\\phi\\). Here, \\(\\rho\\) is the radial distance from the origin, \\(\\theta\\) is the azimuthal angle in the xy-plane from the positive x-axis, and \\(\\phi\\) is the polar angle from the positive z-axis.\n\n## Step 2: Interpreting the Equation \\(\\rho = c\\)\nThe equation \\(\\rho = c\\) means that the radial distance from the origin to any point on the shape is a constant value \\(c\\). This implies that every point with this \\(\\rho\\) value lies on the surface of a sphere because, by definition, all points on the surface of a sphere are equidistant from the center (the origin in this context).\n\n## Step 3: Eliminating Other Options\n- A line (A) is a set of points extending infinitely in two directions with a constant slope, not related to \\(\\rho = c\\).\n- A circle (B) is a set of points equidistant from a central point in a plane, which doesn't fit the three-dimensional nature of \\(\\rho = c\\).\n- A plane (C) is a flat surface that extends infinitely in all directions, not defined by a constant \\(\\rho\\).\n- A sphere (D) is the set of all points in space that are a fixed distance from a given center point, matching our interpretation of \\(\\rho = c\\).\n- A cylinder (E) is a set of points that form a circular cross-section with a constant radius, extending infinitely along an axis, which doesn't match \\(\\rho = c\\).\n- A cone (F) is a set of points that form a circular cross-section with a radius that increases linearly from the apex, not related to \\(\\rho = c\\).\n\n## Step 4: Conclusion\nGiven the equation \\(\\rho = c\\) in spherical coordinates, the shape described is a sphere because all points with a constant \\(\\rho\\) value are equidistant from the origin, fitting the definition of a sphere.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(D)}$"
