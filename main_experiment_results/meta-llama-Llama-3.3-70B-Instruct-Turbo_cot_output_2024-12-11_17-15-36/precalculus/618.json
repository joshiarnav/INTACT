    "solution": "The vector pointing from $(-1,1,1)$ to $(1,-1,1)$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$  Since the plane we are interested in is perpendicular to the plane $x + 2y + 3z = 5,$ its normal vector must be orthogonal to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}.$  But the normal vector of the plane is also orthogonal to $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$  So, to find the normal vector of the plane we are interested in, we take the cross product of these vectors:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -6 \\\\ -6 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Scaling, we take $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector.  Therefore, the equation of the plane is of the form\n\\[x + y - z + D = 0.\\]Substituting the coordinates of $(-1,1,1),$ we find that the equation of the plane is $\\boxed{x + y - z + 1 = 0}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Find the vector normal to the given plane\nThe vector normal to the plane $x + 2y + 3z = 5$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n## Step 2: Find the vector between the two given points\nThe vector between the points $(-1,1,1)$ and $(1,-1,1)$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 - (-1) \\\\ -1 - 1 \\\\ 1 - 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n## Step 3: Find a vector normal to the desired plane\nSince the desired plane is perpendicular to the given plane, the vector normal to the desired plane must be parallel to the given plane. This means it must be orthogonal to the normal vector of the given plane. Additionally, since the desired plane contains the two given points, the vector between these points must lie in the plane, and thus be orthogonal to the normal vector of the desired plane. We can find a vector normal to the desired plane by taking the cross product of the vector between the two points and the normal vector to the given plane: $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (-2)(3) - (0)(2) \\\\ (0)(1) - (2)(3) \\\\ (2)(2) - (-2)(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -6 \\\\ -6 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n## Step 4: Scale the normal vector to have integer components with a greatest common divisor of 1\nThe vector $\\begin{pmatrix} -6 \\\\ -6 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}$ can be scaled by dividing all its components by 6, resulting in $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. To ensure $A > 0$, we can multiply this vector by -1, giving $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n## Step 5: Use one of the given points to find the equation of the plane\nUsing the point-normal form of the equation of a plane $A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) = 0$, where $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is a point on the plane and $\\begin{pmatrix} A \\\\ B \\\\ C \\end{pmatrix}$ is the normal vector to the plane, we can substitute the point $(-1, 1, 1)$ and the normal vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ into this equation to get $1(x - (-1)) + 1(y - 1) -1(z - 1) = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the equation of the plane\nSimplifying the equation $1(x + 1) + 1(y - 1) -1(z - 1) = 0$ gives $x + 1 + y - 1 - z + 1 = 0$, which further simplifies to $x + y - z + 1 = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1x + 1y -1z + 1 = 0}$"
