    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Factor out the common term\nWe can factor out $\\sin x$ from the given equation: $\\sin x(2\\sin^2 x - 5\\sin x + 2) = 0$.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the quadratic term\nThe quadratic term $2\\sin^2 x - 5\\sin x + 2$ can be factored as $(2\\sin x - 1)(\\sin x - 2) = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Set each factor equal to zero\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us the following equations:\n- $\\sin x = 0$\n- $2\\sin x - 1 = 0$\n- $\\sin x - 2 = 0$\n\n## Step 4: Solve the first equation\nFor $\\sin x = 0$, the solutions in the range $0 \\le x \\le 2\\pi$ are $x = 0, \\pi, 2\\pi$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the second equation\nFor $2\\sin x - 1 = 0$, we have $\\sin x = \\frac{1}{2}$. The solutions in the range $0 \\le x \\le 2\\pi$ are $x = \\frac{\\pi}{6}, \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the third equation\nFor $\\sin x - 2 = 0$, we have $\\sin x = 2$. However, $\\sin x$ cannot be greater than 1, so there are no solutions for this equation.\n\n## Step 7: Count the total number of solutions\nCombining the solutions from steps 4 and 5, we have a total of $3 + 2 = 5$ solutions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
