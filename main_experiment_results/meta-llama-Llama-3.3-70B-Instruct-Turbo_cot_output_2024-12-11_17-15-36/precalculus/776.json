    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the formula for the equation of a plane\nThe equation of a plane in 3D space can be represented by the formula $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0,$ where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ and $D$ are constants, and $x,$ $y,$ $z$ are the variables representing the coordinates of any point on the plane.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the significance of the foot of the perpendicular\nThe foot of the perpendicular from the origin to a plane is the point on the plane that is closest to the origin. This point lies on the line that is perpendicular to the plane and passes through the origin. The direction ratios of this line are the same as the coefficients of $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ in the equation of the plane.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the coefficients A, B, and C\nGiven that the foot of the perpendicular is at $(12,-4,3),$ the direction ratios of the line (and thus the coefficients $A,$ $B,$ and $C$) are $12,$ $-4,$ and $3$ respectively. Therefore, $A = 12,$ $B = -4,$ and $C = 3.$\n\n## Step 4: Determine the value of D\nTo find $D,$ we substitute the coordinates of the foot of the perpendicular into the equation of the plane and solve for $D.$ The equation becomes $12(12) - 4(-4) + 3(3) + D = 0.$ Simplifying this gives $144 + 16 + 9 + D = 0,$ which further simplifies to $169 + D = 0.$ Solving for $D$ gives $D = -169.$\n\n## Step 5: Write the equation of the plane\nSubstituting the values of $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ and $D$ into the equation of the plane gives $12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0}$"
