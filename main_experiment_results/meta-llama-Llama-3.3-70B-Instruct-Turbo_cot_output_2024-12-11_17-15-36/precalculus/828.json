    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the relationship between the angle of vectors and their negatives\nWhen considering the angle between two vectors, taking the negative of one of the vectors will change the direction of that vector. This means that if the original angle between vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is $\\theta$, the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ will be $180^\\circ - \\theta$, because $-\\mathbf{a}$ points in the opposite direction of $\\mathbf{a}$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the relationship to the given problem\nGiven that the angle between vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is $43^\\circ$, we can find the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ by subtracting $43^\\circ$ from $180^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the new angle\nNew angle = $180^\\circ - 43^\\circ = 137^\\circ$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{137}$"
