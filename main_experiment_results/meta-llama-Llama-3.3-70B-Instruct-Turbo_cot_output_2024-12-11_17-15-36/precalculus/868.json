    "solution": "Two angles have the same tangent if and only if they differ by a multiple of $\\pi.$  This means $\\tan x - x$ is a multiple of $\\pi.$  Let\n\\[T(x) = \\tan x - x.\\]First, we prove that the function $T(x)$ is strictly increasing on the interval $\\left[ 0, \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right).$  Let $0 \\le x < y < \\frac{\\pi}{2}.$  Then\n\\[y - x < \\tan (y - x) = \\frac{\\tan y - \\tan x}{1 + \\tan x \\tan y} \\le \\tan y - \\tan x.\\]Re-arranging, we get $\\tan x - x < \\tan y - y,$ or $T(x) < T(y).$\n\nNote that as $x$ approaches $\\frac{\\pi}{2},$ $T(x)$ approaches infinity.  This means for every nonnegative integer $n,$ there exists a unique value of $x$ such that $T(x) = n \\pi.$\n\nWe have the estimate $300 \\pi \\approx 942.48.$  Hence,\n\\[T(\\tan^{-1} 942) = 942 - \\tan^{-1} 942 < 942 < 300 \\pi.\\]Also,\n\\[T(\\tan^{-1} 924) = 942 - \\tan^{-1} 942 > 942 - \\frac{\\pi}{2} > 299 \\pi.\\]Since $299 \\pi < T(\\tan^{-1} 942) < 300 \\pi,$ the equation $T(x) = n \\pi$ has a solution on the interval $[0, \\tan^{-1} 942]$ if and only if $0 \\le n < 300,$ so there are $\\boxed{300}$ solutions.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the given equation\nThe equation provided is $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$. This equation suggests that we are looking for values of $x$ where the tangent of $x$ is equal to the tangent of the tangent of $x$. Since the tangent function is periodic with period $\\pi$, for $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ to hold, $x$ and $\\tan x$ must differ by an integer multiple of $\\pi$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the condition for solutions\nFor the equation to have a solution, $\\tan x$ and $x$ should either be equal or differ by $n\\pi$, where $n$ is an integer. This leads to two cases: (i) $\\tan x = x$, and (ii) $\\tan x = x + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\n\n## Step 3: Considering the interval given\nWe are looking for solutions in the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$. Since $\\tan^{-1} 942$ is slightly less than $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (because $\\tan \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ is undefined and approaches infinity as the angle approaches $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$), all solutions within this interval will be relevant.\n\n## Step 4: Identifying solutions for $\\tan x = x$\nIn the given interval, the equation $\\tan x = x$ has exactly one solution, which is $x = 0$. This is because the graph of $\\tan x$ intersects the line $y = x$ only once in the interval $[0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\n\n## Step 5: Identifying solutions for $\\tan x = x + n\\pi$\nFor $\\tan x = x + n\\pi$, we need to consider how many $n\\pi$ values fit within the range of $\\tan x$ when $x$ is between $0$ and $\\tan^{-1} 942$. Since $\\tan x$ increases from $0$ to $942$ over this interval, we look for how many multiples of $\\pi$ are less than or equal to $942$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculating the number of $n\\pi$ values\nThe number of $n\\pi$ values that are less than or equal to $942$ can be found by dividing $942$ by $\\pi$ and taking the floor of that value, since we're looking for whole multiples of $\\pi$. This calculation gives us the number of additional solutions beyond the $x = 0$ solution.\n\n## Step 7: Performing the calculation\nTo find the number of solutions, we calculate $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{\\pi} \\right\\rfloor + 1$, where the $+1$ accounts for the solution at $x = 0$.\n\n## Step 8: Final calculation\n$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{\\pi} \\right\\rfloor \\approx \\left\\lfloor 299.958 \\right\\rfloor = 299$. Adding $1$ for the $x = 0$ solution gives us $300$ solutions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{300}$"
