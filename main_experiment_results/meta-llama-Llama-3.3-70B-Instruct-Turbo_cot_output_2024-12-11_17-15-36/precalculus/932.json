    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the restrictions on the domain of the function due to the square root and logarithm.\nThe function $y=\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ requires that $\\cos x \\geq 0$ because the square root of a negative number is not a real number, and the logarithm of a non-positive number is undefined. For $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$, $\\cos x$ is always positive, so this condition is satisfied.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the range of $\\cos x$ for $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$.\nSince $\\cos x$ ranges from 0 to 1 (excluding 0) for $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$, we can say $0 < \\cos x \\leq 1$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the range of $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$.\nGiven $0 < \\cos x \\leq 1$, taking the square root yields $0 < \\sqrt{\\cos x} \\leq 1$ because the square root of a number between 0 and 1 is also between 0 and 1.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the range of $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$.\nThe logarithm function $\\log_2 x$ is defined for $x > 0$ and yields all real numbers. Since $0 < \\sqrt{\\cos x} \\leq 1$, $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ will yield all non-positive real numbers because $\\log_2 1 = 0$ and as $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$ approaches 0, $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ approaches $-\\infty$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(-\\infty,0]}$"
