    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Find the direction vector of the line\nTo find! the direction vector of the line passing through points $(3,4,1)$ and $(5,1,6)$, we subtract the coordinates of the first point from the coordinates of the second point. The direction vector \\(\\vec{v}\\) is given by \\((5-3, 1-4, 6-1) = (2, -3, 5)\\).\n\n## Step 2: Write the parametric equations of the line\nThe parametric equations of the line passing through the point \\((3,4,1)\\) with a direction vector \\(\\vec{v} = (2, -3, 5)\\) can be written as \\(x = 3 + 2t\\), \\(y = 4 - 3t\\), and \\(z = 1 + 5t\\), where \\(t\\) is a parameter.\n\n## Step 3: Find the intersection with the xy-plane\nThe \\(xy\\)-plane is defined by \\(z = 0\\). To find where the line intersects the \\(xy\\)-plane, we set \\(z = 0\\) in the parametric equation for \\(z\\), which gives us \\(0 = 1 + 5t\\). Solving for \\(t\\), we get \\(5t = -1\\), hence \\(t = -\\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the x and y coordinates of the intersection\nSubstitute \\(t = -\\frac{1}{5}\\) into the parametric equations for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). For \\(x\\), we have \\(x = 3 + 2(-\\frac{1}{5}) = 3 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{15}{5} - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{13}{5}\\). For \\(y\\), we have \\(y = 4 - 3(-\\frac{1}{5}) = 4 + \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{20}{5} + \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{23}{5}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(\\frac{13}{5},\\frac{23}{5},0)}$"
