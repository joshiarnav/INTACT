    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the equation\nWe are given the equation $\\frac{x}{100} = \\sin x.$ This is a transcendental equation, meaning we cannot solve it using ordinary algebraic methods. The equation involves a trigonometric function, $\\sin x$, which is periodic and oscillates between -1 and 1.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the range of $\\sin x$\nThe sine function, $\\sin x$, oscillates between -1 and 1. This means that for any real value of $x$, $\\sin x$ will always be between -1 and 1.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the bounds for $x$\nGiven that $\\frac{x}{100} = \\sin x$, we can see that $\\frac{x}{100}$ must also be between -1 and 1 because $\\sin x$ is between -1 and 1. Therefore, $-1 \\leq \\frac{x}{100} \\leq 1$. Multiplying all parts by 100 gives $-100 \\leq x \\leq 100$.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the periodic nature of $\\sin x$\nThe sine function is periodic with a period of $2\\pi$. This means that the graph of $\\sin x$ repeats every $2\\pi$ units. However, the function $\\frac{x}{100}$ is linear and increases continuously. The solutions to the equation will occur where the line $\\frac{x}{100}$ intersects the sine wave.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the number of solutions within the bounds\nGiven the periodic nature of $\\sin x$ and the linear increase of $\\frac{x}{100}$, we can expect multiple intersections within the range $-100 \\leq x \\leq 100$. The key is to recognize that each period of $\\sin x$ (which is $2\\pi$) will contain two intersections (one going up and one going down) except possibly at the very ends of the interval.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the approximate number of periods of $\\sin x$ within the range\nThe range from -100 to 100 covers $200$ units. Given that the period of $\\sin x$ is $2\\pi$, the number of full periods within this range is $\\frac{200}{2\\pi} \\approx 31.83$. However, this calculation does not directly give us the number of solutions but rather an estimate of how many cycles of $\\sin x$ fit within our range.\n\n## Step 7: Account for solutions\nIn each period of $\\sin x$, there are typically two solutions (one where the line intersects the sine curve on its way up and one on its way down) due to the symmetry of the sine function about its zeroes. However, at the edges of our interval, we might not get a full pair of solutions if the line $\\frac{x}{100}$ does not intersect the sine curve in that particular period.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the central solution\nThere is also a solution at $x = 0$ because $\\sin(0) = 0$ and $\\frac{0}{100} = 0$. This solution is unique in that it does not come in a pair like the others.\n\n## Step 9: Estimate the total number of solutions\nGiven the approximate number of periods and considering that each period could contain two solutions, we might initially estimate around $2 \\times 31.83 \\approx 63.66$ solutions. However, this is a rough estimate and does not account for edge cases or the fact that not all periods may contribute two solutions due to the bounds of $x$.\n\n## Step 10: Adjust for the actual question\nThe question asks for the number of real solutions. Given the nature of $\\sin x$ and the line $\\frac{x}{100}$, and recognizing that our estimate needs refinement, we must consider that the actual number of solutions will be a whole number and will reflect the symmetry and periodicity of $\\sin x$ within the given bounds.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{63}$"
