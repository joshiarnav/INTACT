Using one or both of the school colors, how many different flags are possible if adjacent stripes may be the same color?\n\n[asy]\nsize(75);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,12));\ndot((0,12));\ndraw((0,12)--(8,12)--(8,11)--(0,11));\ndraw((8,11)--(8,9)--(0,9));\ndraw((8,9)--(8,6)--(0,6));\n[/asy]",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are two possible colors for the first stripe, two possible colors for the second stripe, and two possible colors for the third stripe. Since the colors of each stripe are mutually exclusive, there are $2\\times 2 \\times 2 = \\boxed{8}$ ways to color the flag.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  First, we need to identify the possible colors for the three horizontal stripes on the flag. The school colors are purple and gold, and the problem states that adjacent stripes may be the same color.\nStep 2:  We can start by considering the number of possibilities for the top stripe. Since the top stripe can be either purple or gold, we have two options for the top stripe.\n\nWe'll stop here to ensure we're setting up the problem correctly before proceeding with the next step.\nStep 2:  Similarly, the middle stripe can also be either purple or gold, which gives us another two options. The same applies to the bottom stripe, resulting in two options for each stripe.\n\nWe'll stop here and wait for the next step.\nStep 3:  Since each of the three stripes has two options (purple or gold), we can find the total number of possible flags by multiplying the number of options for each stripe. Therefore, the total number of possible flags is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{8}$ ways to create a flag using one or both of the school colors, with adjacent stripes allowed to be the same color.",
