    "problem": "Crestview's school colors are purple and gold. The students are designing a flag using three solid-colored horizontal stripes, as shown. Using one or both of the school colors, how many different flags are possible if adjacent stripes may be the same color?\n\n[asy]\nsize(75);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,12));\ndot((0,12));\ndraw((0,12)--(8,12)--(8,11)--(0,11));\ndraw((8,11)--(8,9)--(0,9));\ndraw((8,9)--(8,6)--(0,6));\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "There are two possible colors for the first stripe, two possible colors for the second stripe, and two possible colors for the third stripe. Since the colors of each stripe are mutually exclusive, there are $2\\times 2 \\times 2 = \\boxed{8}$ ways to color the flag.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of different flags that are possible using the school colors, purple and gold, for three solid-colored horizontal stripes.\n## Step 2:  Since adjacent stripes can be the same color, each stripe has two possible colors: purple or gold.\n## Step 3:  The first stripe can be either purple or gold, giving us 2 possibilities.\n## Step 4:  The second stripe also has 2 possibilities, regardless of the color chosen for the first stripe, as adjacent stripes can be the same color.\n## Step 5:  Similarly, the third stripe has 2 possibilities, as it can be either the same color as the first and second stripes, or the opposite color.\n## Step 6:  To find the total number of possible flags, we need to calculate the total number of combinations by multiplying the number of possibilities for each stripe.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the total number of different flags that are possible is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^3 = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
