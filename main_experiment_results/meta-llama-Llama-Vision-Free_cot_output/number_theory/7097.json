    "solution": "Taking inspiration from $4^4 \\mid 10^{10}$ we are inspired to take $n$ to be $p^2$, the lowest prime not dividing $210$, or $11 \\implies n = 121$. Now, there are $242$ factors of $11$, so $11^{242} \\mid m^m$, and then $m = 11k$ for $k \\geq 22$. Now, $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = \\gcd(11+k,210) = 1$. Noting $k = 26$ is the minimal that satisfies this, we get $(n,m) = (121,286)$. Thus, it is easy to verify this is minimal and we get $\\boxed{407}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given conditions\nWe need to find two positive integers $m$ and $n$ satisfying three conditions:\n- The greatest common divisor of $m+n$ and $210$ is $1$.\n- $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$.\n- $m$ is not a multiple of $n$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the implications of the conditions\nThe condition $\\gcd(m+n, 210)=1$ implies that $m+n$ cannot share any prime factors with $210$. Thus, $m+n$ cannot be divisible by $2, 3, 5,$ or $7$.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the condition $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$\nFor $m^m$ to be a multiple of $n^n$, $n$ must be composed of the prime factors of $m$ in such a way that when raised to the power of $n$, it divides $m$ raised to the power of $m$.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the condition $m$ is not a multiple of $n$\nThis condition means we cannot have $m = kn$, where $k$ is an integer, since $n$ must be a proper divisor of $m$ in order to satisfy the second condition.\n\n## Step 5: Determine a suitable $n$\nWe need to find a value for $n$ that satisfies the conditions and will make it easy to find a corresponding $m$ that satisfies the conditions as well.\n\n## Step 6: Choose a suitable $n$ that could be a power of a prime\nConsidering the conditions, let's choose $n=p^a$, where $p$ is a prime not dividing $210$ and $a$ is a positive integer. This choice helps us ensure that $m+n$ is not divisible by any prime factors of $210$.\n\n## Step 7: Select a prime $p$ not dividing $210$\nThe prime number $11$ is not a factor of $210$, so let's try $p=11$.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the value of $a$ for $n=p^a$\nWe choose the smallest value of $a$ that allows $m^m$ to be a multiple of $n^n$. For $n=11^a$, the smallest value of $a$ that allows this is $a=1$, but we know $m$ should not be a multiple of $n$.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the value of $a$ for $n=p^a$\nFor $a>1$, let $n=11^2$, and we need to find a corresponding $m$ that satisfies the conditions.\n\n## Step 10: Find a suitable $m$ corresponding to $n=11^2$\nTo minimize $m+n$, we can try to find the smallest $m$ that satisfies the conditions.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the smallest $m$ that satisfies the conditions\nWe can try to find the smallest $m$ that satisfies $\\gcd(m+n,210)=1$, $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$, but $m$ is not a multiple of $n$."
