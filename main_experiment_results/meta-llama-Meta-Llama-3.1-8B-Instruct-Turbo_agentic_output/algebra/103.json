    "solution": "We only need to worry about the terms that multiply to have a degree of $2$. This would be given by the product of the terms $3x^2$ and $-4$ as well as the product of the terms $-2x$ and $-7x$. Thus, $$(3x^2) \\times (-4) + (-2x) \\times (-7x) = -12x^2 + 14x^2 = 2x^2,$$and the coefficient is $\\boxed{2}$.",
