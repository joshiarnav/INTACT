    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We are looking at the range of $f(x)$ when $x$ is in the interval $[1,\\infty)$. Because $k < 0$, $f(x)$ is decreasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. We see that $f(1) = 1^k = 1$, and as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ approaches 0, but never reaches it.  Hence, on the interval $[1,\\infty)$, $f(x)$ takes on all values between 0 (exclusive) and 1 inclusive, which means the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{(0,1]}$.",

We can find the range by evaluating the function at the endpoints of the interval. At $x = 1$, $f(x) = 1^k = 1$. As $x$ approaches $\\infty$, $f(x) = x^k$ approaches $0$ because as $x$ increases, $x^k$ decreases when $k$ is negative.\nStep 3: Since $f(x)$ is a decreasing function on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ and it approaches $1$ at $x = 1$ and $0$ as $x$ approaches $\\infty$, the range of $f(x)$ on this interval is $(0, 1]$.\nStep 4: The range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ is $(0, 1]$ as it includes all the values that $f(x)$ takes between its approach to $0$ as $x$ approaches $\\infty$ and its value of $1$ at $x = 1$.\nStep 5: This is the final step.
