    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We begin by expressing both sides of the equation in terms of the base 2: $(3^3)^8=(3^2)^q$, which simplifies to $3^{24}=3^{2q}$. Setting the exponents equal to each other, $24=2q$, or $q=\\boxed{12}$.",

Now, equate the exponents: $3^{24} = 3^{2q}$.\nSince the bases are equal, set the exponents equal to each other: $24 = 2q$.\nDivide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for q: $\\frac{24}{2} = q$, $q = 12$.\nNow, we can solve for q: $24 = 2q \\Rightarrow q = \\frac{24}{2}$.\nDivide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for q: $\\frac{24}{2} = q$, $q = 12$.",
