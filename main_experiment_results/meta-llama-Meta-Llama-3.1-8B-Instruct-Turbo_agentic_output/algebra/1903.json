    "problem": "If $\\log_9 (x-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$, find $\\log_{625} x$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "In order to find $\\log_{625} x$, we must first find $x$. We begin by writing $\\log_9 (x-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$ in exponential form, which gives us $9^{\\frac12}=x-2$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=9^{\\frac12}+2=3+2=5$. After plugging this value of $x$ into the second expression, the final step is to find $\\log_{625} 5$. Since we know that $625=5^4$ or $625^{\\frac14}=5$, $\\log_{625} 5=\\boxed{\\frac14}$.",

    "model_solution": "First, rewrite the given logarithmic equation as an exponential equation: $9^{\\frac{1}{2}}=x-2$.\nTo solve for $x$, add $2$ to both sides of the equation: $9^{\\frac{1}{2}} + 2 = x$.\nNext, rewrite $9^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ as $\\sqrt{9}=3$, so the equation becomes $x=3+2$.\nNow, evaluate the expression to find the value of $x$: $x=5$. \n\nNext, find $\\log_{625} 5$.  To do this, rewrite it as $\\frac{\\log 5}{\\log 625}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{\\log 5}{\\log 5^4}$ using the property of logarithms $b^c = a \\implies \\log_b a = c$. \n\nThis simplifies further to $\\frac{\\log 5}{4\\log 5}$, which then simplifies to $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSo, the solution is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",
