Substituting this, the fraction becomes: $$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}+2\\sqrt[3]{2}}=\\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{2}}$$ To rationalize this, we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by something that will eliminate the cube root in the denominator.  If we multiply $\\sqrt[3]{2}$, by $\\sqrt[3]{4}$, then the result will be $\\sqrt[3]{2}\\cdot\\sqrt[3]{4}=\\sqrt[3]{2\\cdot4}=\\sqrt[3]{8}=2$.  So, multiply the expression above by $\\dfrac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}$. $$\\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}=\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{3\\sqrt[3]{8}}=\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{6}}$$",
