I would like to place this picture in an elongated frame of dimensions $(2x + 3)$ and  $(y+2)$.

The dimensions of the frame are $(2x + 3)$ and $(y+2)$, and the area of the frame is $34$ square inches.\nStep 2:  To start, we need to find the area of the frame by subtracting the area of the picture from the total area of the frame. This gives us the expression $(2x + 3)(y + 2) - xy = 34$.\nStep 3:  Next, we expand and simplify the expression to obtain $2xy + 4x + 3y + 6 - xy = 34$, which further simplifies to $xy + 4x + 3y + 6 = 34$.\nStep 4:  Rearranging terms, we get $xy + 4x + 3y = 28$.\nStep 5:  To solve for the area of the picture, we need to use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick (SFFT) to factorize the equation $xy + 4x + 3y = 28$.\nStep 6:  Using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick (SFFT), we add 12 to both sides of the equation to get $xy + 4x + 3y + 12 = 40$. This can be factored into the form $(x + 3)(y + 4) = 40$.\nWe now need to find the pairs of integers that multiply to $40$. The pairs are $(1, 40), (2, 20), (4, 10), (5, 8), (-1, -40), (-2, -20), (-4, -10),$ and $(-5, -8)$. Then, we solve the system of linear equations $x + 3 = a$ and $y + 4 = b$, where $(a, b)$ is one of the pairs of factors of $40$.\nStep 7:  To find the possible values of $x$ and $y$, we need to solve the system of linear equations $x + 3 = a$ and $y + 4 = b$ for each pair of factors of $40$. We will then check which pairs satisfy the condition that $x$ and $y$ are both integers greater than one.\nStep 8:  We now need to solve the system of linear equations $x + 3 = a$ and $y + 4 = b$ for each pair of factors of $40$. For each pair of factors $(a, b)$, we calculate the corresponding values of $x$ and $y$ using $x = a - 3$ and $y = b - 4$. We then check which of these pairs of values satisfy the conditions that $x$ and $y$ are both integers greater than one and have an area of $xy$ that matches one of the given pairs of factors. We can then discard any pairs that do not satisfy these conditions.\nStep 9:  After checking the possible pairs of factors of $40$, we find that only the pair $(5, 8)$ yields integer values for $x$ and $y$ greater than one. Therefore, the dimensions of the picture are $x = 5 - 3 = 2$ and $y = 8 - 4 = 4$. The area of the picture is then $xy = 2 \\times 4 = 8$ square inches.\nStep 10:  The pair (5, 8) corresponds to the values $x = 5 - 3 = 2$ and $y = 8 - 4 = 4$.
