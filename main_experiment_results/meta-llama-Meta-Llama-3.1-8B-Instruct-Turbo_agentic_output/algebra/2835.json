    "solution": "Since $E$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$, it has coordinates $(\\frac{1}{2}(8+0),\\frac{1}{2}(0+0))=(4,0)$.\nThe line passing through the points $A$ and $E$ has slope $\\frac{6-0}{0-4}=-\\frac{3}{2}$; the $y$-intercept of this line is the $y$-coordinate of point $A$, or 6.\nTherefore, the equation of the line passing through points $A$ and $E$ is $y=-\\frac{3}{2}x+6$.\nPoint $F$ is the intersection point of the lines with equation $y=-\\frac{3}{8}x+3$ and $y=-\\frac{3}{2}x+6$.\nTo find the coordinates of point $F$ we solve the system of equations by equating $y$:\n\\begin{align*}\n-\\tfrac{3}{8}x+3&=-\\tfrac{3}{2}x+6\\\\\n8(-\\tfrac{3}{8}x+3)&=8(-\\tfrac{3}{2}x+6)\\\\\n-3x+24&=-12x+48\\\\\n9x&=24\n\\end{align*}Thus the $x$-coordinate of point $F$ is $x=\\frac{8}{3}$; it follows that $y=-\\frac{3}{2}\\times \\frac{8}{3}+6=2$.  Hence $F=(\\frac{8}{3},2)$ and sum of its coordinates are $\\frac{8}{3} + 2 = \\frac{8}{3}+\\frac{6}{3}=\\boxed{\\frac{14}{3}}$.",

We can use the slope formula to find the slope of line AE, which is (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (6 - 0) / (0 - 4) = -3/2.\nThe next step is to use the point-slope form of a line, $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line. We will use point $A(0,6)$ and the slope $m = -\\frac{3}{2}$ to find the equation of line $AE$. This gives us $y - 6 = -\\frac{3}{2}(x - 0)$. Simplifying, we get $y = -\\frac{3}{2}x + 6$.\nTo find the equation of line CD, we can use the slope formula to find the slope of line CD, which is (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (3 - 0) / (0 - 8) = -3/8.

We have $-\\frac{3}{2}x + 6 = -\\frac{3}{8}x + 3$. \n\nSolving for x, we first multiply both sides by 24 to get rid of the fractions, resulting in $-36x + 144 = -9x + 72$. \n\nThen, we subtract -9x from -36x to get $-45x + 144 = 72$. \n\nNext, we subtract 144 from both sides to get $-45x = -72$. \n\nFinally, we divide both sides by -45 to get $x = \\frac{8}{3}$.\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of point F, we can substitute $x = \\frac{8}{3}$ into the equation of line AE, $y = -\\frac{3}{2}x + 6$, to find the y-coordinate of point F.

To add a fraction and an integer, we need to convert the integer to a fraction with the same denominator.
