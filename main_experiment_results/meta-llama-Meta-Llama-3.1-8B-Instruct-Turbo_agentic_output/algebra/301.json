    "problem": "The Cookie Monster encounters a cookie whose boundary is the equation $x^2+y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3 y$ and is very confused. He wants to know if this cookie is a lunch-sized cookie or a snack-sized cookie. What is the radius of this cookie?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The equation $x^2+y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3 y$ can be rewritten as $x^2-x+y^2-3y=6.5$. Completing the square and writing decimals as fractions, this can further be rewritten as $\\left( x - \\dfrac{1}{2} \\right)^2 - \\dfrac{1}{4} + \\left( y - \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)^2 - \\dfrac{9}{4}=\\dfrac{13}{2}$. Moving the constants to the right side of the equation, this is $\\left( x - \\dfrac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( y - \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)^2 = \\dfrac{10}{4}+\\dfrac{13}{2}=\\dfrac{18}{2}=9$, which is the equation of a circle with center $\\left( \\dfrac{1}{2}, \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)$ and radius $\\boxed{3}$.",
