    "solution": "Simplifying, we have  $18(x+y)=xy$, so $xy - 18x - 18y = 0$ Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick by adding 324 to both sides, we get $xy-18x-18y +324=324$, so \\[(x-18)(y-18)=324.\\]Now we seek the minimal $x+y,$ which occurs when $x-18$ and $y-18$ are as close to each other in value as possible. The two best candidates are $(x-18,y-18)=(12,27)$ or $(9,36),$ of which $(x,y)=(30,45)$ attains the minimum sum of $\\boxed{75}$.",
