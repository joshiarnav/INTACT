    "solution": "Note that $(x+4)(y+5)$ equals $xy+5x+4y+20$.  So, add $20$ to both sides of the original equation to get $xy+5x+4y+20=15$, so now we may apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and write the equation as $(x+4)(y+5)=15$.\n\nThen, the potential ordered pairs $((x+4),(y+5))$ with $x<y$ are $(-15,-1)$, $(-5,-3)$, $(1,15)$ and $(3,5)$, since these are the pairs of integers that multiply to 15.  The greatest value for $y+5$ is thus $15$.  We solve $y+5=15$ for $y$ to yield $y=\\boxed{10}$.",

The pairs are (1,15), (3,5), and their corresponding negative pairs. Now we can solve for $y$ in each pair to find the greatest possible value of $y$.\nTo find the greatest possible value of y, we need to solve for y in each pair and find the maximum value. We start with the first pair (1, 15), so we set x + 4 = 1 and y + 5 = 15, resulting in y = 10.\nFor the pair (3, 5), we set x + 4 = 3 and y + 5 = 5, resulting in y = 0.\nNow we consider the corresponding negative pairs. For the pair (-1, -15), we set $x+4=-1$ and $y+5=-15$, resulting in $y=-20$. \n\nFor the pair (-3, -5), we set $x+4=-3$ and $y+5=-5$, resulting in $y=-10$.\nNow we need to consider the pair (15, 1). We set $x+4=15$ and $y+5=1$, resulting in $y=-4$.\nWe now consider the pair (5, 3). We set $x+4=5$ and $y+5=3$, resulting in $y=-2$.\nNow we need to consider the pair (-15, -1). We set $x+4=-15$ and $y+5=-1$, resulting in $y=-6$. We also need to consider the pair (-5, -3). We set $x+4=-5$ and $y+5=-3$, resulting in $y=-8$.\nWe have found all the possible values of $y$: 10, 0, -20, -10, -4, -2, -6, -8. The greatest possible value of $y$ is $\\boxed{10}$.",
