    "problem": "Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles. If it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles, using the same rates, how many minutes would it take Jordan to run 5 miles?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since Steve's 3-mile time is 24 minutes, Jordan ran 2 miles in $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot24=12$ minutes.  Therefore, each mile takes Jordan 6 minutes to run, so he would take $6\\cdot5=\\boxed{30}$ minutes to run five miles.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "First step: Since it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles, we can find Steve's rate of running by dividing the total time by the total distance. Steve's rate = 24 minutes / 3 miles.\nSecond step: Since Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles, and it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles, it took Jordan 24 / 2 = 12 minutes to run 2 miles.\nThird step: Find Jordan's rate of running by dividing the total time by the total distance. Jordan's rate = 12 minutes / 2 miles. \n\nThen, we can multiply Jordan's rate by the new total distance (5 miles) to find the new total time for Jordan to run 5 miles.\nFourth step: Multiply Jordan's rate by the new total distance to find the new total time. \n12 minutes / 2 miles = 6 minutes per mile (simplified rate)\n6 minutes per mile * 5 miles = 30 minutes.\nFifth step: Since Jordan ran 5 miles at the same rate, it would take him the calculated total time to run the 5 miles.\nSince we've found that it would take Jordan 30 minutes to run 5 miles, there's no need for further steps. \n\n$\\boxed{30}$",
