    "problem": "The product of two positive integers plus their sum is 103. The integers are relatively prime, and each is less than 20. What is the sum of the two integers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let our numbers be $a$ and $b$ with $a>b.$ Then $ab+a+b=103$. With Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick in mind, we add $1$ to both sides and get $ab+a+b+1 = 104$, which factors as $(a+1)(b+1)=104$. We consider pairs $(a+1, b+1)$ of factors of $104$: $(104,1), (52,2), (26,4), (13,8)$. Since $a<20$, we can rule out the first 3 pairs, which gives $a=12$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\\boxed{19}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's start by defining the two positive integers as x and y, where x < y. We are given the equation xy + x + y = 103. We can apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick by adding 1 to both sides of the equation to get xy + x + y + 1 = 104. This can be rewritten as (x + 1)(y + 1) = 104.\nWe need to find the pairs of factors of 104 that satisfy the conditions x < y and x + 1 < 21. The pairs of factors of 104 are (1, 104), (2, 52), (4, 26), (8, 13).\nSince each integer is less than 20, we can discard the pairs (1, 104) and (2, 52). Now, we need to find the pairs of integers that satisfy (x + 1)(y + 1) = 104, x < y, and x < 19. This leaves us with (4, 26) and (8, 13), but since the integers are relatively prime, we can discard (4, 26).\nSince the integers are relatively prime, we discard (4, 26) and consider (8, 13). We have (x + 1)(y + 1) = 104, where (x + 1, y + 1) = (8, 13). Therefore, x + 1 = 8 and y + 1 = 13.\nWe now have x + 1 = 8 and y + 1 = 13. Subtracting 1 from each equation, we get x = 7 and y = 12.\nSince we have found the values of x and y to be 7 and 12 respectively, we can calculate their sum.\n\nx + y = 7 + 12 = 19\nWe have found the values of x and y to be 7 and 12 respectively, and their sum is x + y.\nWe have found the values of x and y to be 7 and 12 respectively.
