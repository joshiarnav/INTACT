    "problem": "How many distinct sequences of four letters can be made from the letters in EQUALS if each sequence must begin with L, end with Q, and no letter can appear in a sequence more than once?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, the first step is to determine the number of options for the second letter in the sequence, given that the first letter is L and the last letter is Q, and no letter can appear more than once. \n\nSince the word EQUALS has 6 letters: E, Q, U, A, L, and S, we can remove L and Q from the options because they are already placed. This leaves us with 4 options for the second letter.\nThe next step is to determine the number of options for the third letter in the sequence. Since the second letter has been chosen, the first and last letters are already placed, and no letter can appear more than once, we are left with 3 options for the third letter. \n\nThe first letter is L, the second letter is chosen from 4 options, the third letter chosen from 3 options, and the last letter is Q. Therefore, the total number of distinct sequences can be found by multiplying the number of options for each position.\nTo find the total number of distinct sequences, we multiply the number of options for each position: 1 option for L, 4 options for the second letter, 3 options for the third letter, and 1 option for Q.\nTo find the total number of distinct sequences, we multiply the number of options for each position: \n\n1 (option for L) * 4 (options for the second letter) * 3 (options for the third letter) * 1 (option for Q) = 12\nWe have found the total number of distinct sequences, which is 12.\nThe final step is to write the total number of distinct sequences as the final answer. \n\n$\\boxed{12}$",
