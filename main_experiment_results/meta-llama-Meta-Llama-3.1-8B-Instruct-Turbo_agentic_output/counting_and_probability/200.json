    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The probability that Kim does not have a math test is equal to one minus the probability she does have a math test. So, the probability of not having a math test is $1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$.",

    "model_solution": "The probability that Kim has a math test today is $\\frac{4}{7}$. \n\nStep 1: Let $E$ be the event that Kim has a math test today. Then the probability of event $E$ is $P(E) = \\frac{4}{7}$. The probability that Kim does not have a math test today is the complement of event $E$.\nStep 2: The probability that Kim does not have a math test today is the complement of event $E$, which is denoted as $P(E^c)$. Since the sum of the probabilities of an event and its complement is $1$, we have $P(E^c) = 1 - P(E) = 1 - \\frac{4}{7}$.\nStep 3: We simplify the expression $1 - \\frac{4}{7}$. Since $1 = \\frac{7}{7}$, we have $1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{7}{7} - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{7-4}{7} = \\frac{3}{7}$.\nStep 4: \nThe probability that Kim does not have a math test today is $\\frac{3}{7}$.\nStep 4: \nSince we have found the probability that Kim does not have a math test today, we can now provide the final answer.\nStep 4: The final probability that Kim does not have a math test today is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$.",
