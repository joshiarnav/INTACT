    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since $12! = 12 \\cdot 11!$, we can examine the sum better by factoring $11!$ out of both parts: $$ 11! + 12! = 11! + 12 \\cdot 11! = 11!(1 + 12) = 11! \\cdot 13. $$Since no prime greater than 11 divides $11!$, $\\boxed{13}$ is the largest prime factor of $11! + 12!$.",

    "model_solution": "First step: \n\n11! + 12! can be simplified by factoring out 11!, which results in:\n\n11!(1 + 12) \n= 11! * 13\nSecond step: \n\nSince 11! is the product of all numbers from 1 to 11, it includes 13 as one of its factors. Therefore, 13 is also a factor of 11! * 13, making 13 a common factor. This eliminates 13 from being the largest prime divisor of 11! + 12!. The next step is to find the largest prime factor of 11!.\nTo find the largest prime factor of 11!, we can list the prime numbers from 1 to 11 and choose the largest one, which is 11.\nThird step: Since 11 is the largest prime factor of 11! and it is also a factor of 11! * 13, the largest prime factor of 11! + 12! must be greater than 11. Therefore, we need to find the largest prime number that divides 12!.\nFourth step: \n\nThe prime numbers from 1 to 12 are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. Since 11 is already accounted for as a factor of 11!, the largest prime factor of 12! must be either 2, 3, 5, or 7. However, 5 is the largest prime number among these and is also a factor of 12!.\nFifth step: \nSince 5 is the largest prime factor of 12!, and 5 is not a factor of 11! (because 11! does not include multiples of 25 or 5^2), the largest prime factor of 11! + 12! is 5.\nSince 5 is the largest prime factor of 12!, and 5 is not a factor of 11!, the largest prime factor of 11! + 12! is indeed 5. Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",
