    "solution": "The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2. There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum IS even is $1-\\frac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers is even, we need to first determine the total number of possible pairs of distinct prime numbers that can be selected from the first seven prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\nThe first step is to find the total number of ways to select two numbers from a set of 7 distinct numbers. This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to select. \n\nSo, the total number of possible pairs of distinct prime numbers is C(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7 - 2)!) = 7! / (2! * 5!).\nTo find the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers is even, we need to find the number of pairs where the sum is even and divide it by the total number of pairs. A sum is even if both numbers are either both even or both odd. Since there is only one even prime number (2) among the first seven prime numbers, the only way to get an even sum is to select two odd prime numbers.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of pairs of two odd prime numbers. Since there are 6 odd prime numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17) among the first seven prime numbers, the number of pairs of two odd prime numbers is C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6 - 2)!) = 6! / (2! * 4!).\nTo find the number of pairs of two odd prime numbers, we calculate C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * 4!) = (6 * 5) / (2! * 1) = 15.\nSince there are 15 pairs of two odd prime numbers and a total of 21 possible pairs, the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers is an even number is 15/21, which simplifies to 5/7.\nSince the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers is even is 15/21, we simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. \n\n15/21 simplifies to 5/7.\nThe next step is to confirm that the simplified fraction 5/7 is the correct probability that the sum of two distinct numbers is an even number.\nTo confirm the probability, it is essential to consider the two main scenarios for an even sum: both numbers being even or both numbers being odd. Since the only even prime is 2, a sum of two distinct numbers will be even only when two odd primes are both selected, which we have already calculated.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers is an even number is indeed $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",
