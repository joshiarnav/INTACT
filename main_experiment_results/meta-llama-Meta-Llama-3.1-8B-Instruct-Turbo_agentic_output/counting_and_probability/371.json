    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of balls in the different boxes.\n\nThere are $3$ ways to arrange the balls as $(5,0,0)$ (specifically, box 1 can have 5, box 2 can have 5, box 3 can have 5).\n\nThere are $3! = 6$ to arrange $(4,1,0)$ and $3! = 6$ ways to arrange $(3,2,0)$; in each case, we must choose one of the 3 boxes to have the largest number of balls, and also one of the remaining two boxes to be left empty.\n\nHowever, there are only $3$ ways to arrange $(3,1,1)$, and $3$ ways to arrange $(2,2,1)$; in each case, we must choose one box to have the `different' number of balls (3 in the $(3,1,1)$ case and 1 in the $(2,2,1)$ case).\n\nThis gives a total of $3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = \\boxed{21}$ arrangements.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of \"stars and bars\" or combinations with repetition. \n\nStep 1: We need to create a string of 5 stars (representing the balls) and 2 bars (representing the separation between boxes). The order of the stars and bars doesn't matter. The formula to find the number of ways to arrange these stars and bars is (stars + bars) choose bars, which is (5 + 2) choose 2.\nStep 2: Calculate the combination using the formula (n choose r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items (stars + bars) and r is the number of bars. Plug in the values: n = 7 (5 stars + 2 bars) and r = 2. \n\nWe need to calculate 7 choose 2. \n\n7! / (2! * (7-2)!) = 7! / (2! * 5!)\nTo find the final value, calculate the factorials and simplify the expression: \n\n7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040\n2! = 2 * 1 = 2\n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n\nThen, substitute these values into the expression: \n(7! / (2! * 5!)) = (5040 / (2 * 120)) = (5040 / 240) = 21\nThe final step is to conclude that there are 21 ways to put 5 indistinguishable balls in 3 distinguishable boxes. \n\n$\\boxed{21}$",
