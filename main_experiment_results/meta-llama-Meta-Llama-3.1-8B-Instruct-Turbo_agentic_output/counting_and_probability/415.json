    "solution": "It is easier to count the number of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. We see there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150, namely $1^{2}, 2^{2}, \\ldots, 12^{2}$, and there are 5 perfect cubes, namely $1^{3}, \\ldots, 5^{3}$. Then notice there are two repetitions, $1^{6} =1^2 = 1^3 = 1$ and $2^{6} = 8^2 = 4^3 = 64$. So there is a total of $12+5-2=15$ integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Thus, we get $150-15=135$ integers from 1 to 150 that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes. So the probability that we select such a number is $\\frac{135}{150} = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the selected number is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube, we need to first determine the total number of perfect squares and perfect cubes from 1 to 150.\n\nStep 1: Identify the perfect squares from 1 to 150. \n\nWe can find the largest perfect square less than or equal to 150 by taking the square root of 150.\nStep 2: \nNow that we have the perfect squares from 1 to 150, let's identify the perfect cubes. \nTo find the largest perfect cube less than or equal to 150, we can find the cube root of 150. \nThe cube root of 150 is approximately 5.313. Therefore, the largest perfect cube less than or equal to 150 is $5^3 = 125$. \nNow we need to count the number of perfect cubes and then find the total number of numbers that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes, considering any overlap.\nStep 3: \nNow, we need to find the total number of perfect squares and perfect cubes from 1 to 150. We found that there are 12 perfect squares (from 1 to 12^2) and 5 perfect cubes (from 1 to 5^3). To find the total number of numbers that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes, considering any overlap, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We sum the two sets (perfect squares and perfect cubes) and then subtract the overlap, which are the numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes. The perfect squares that are also perfect cubes are 1 and 64, so the total number of numbers that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes is 12 + 5 - 2 = 15.\nStep 4: \nNow that we have the total number of numbers that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes (15), we can find the probability that the selected number is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of perfect squares or perfect cubes from the total number of numbers (150), and then dividing by the total number of numbers. So, the probability is $\\frac{150-15}{150} = \\frac{135}{150}$, which can be simplified to $\\frac{27}{30}$, and further reduced to $\\frac{9}{10}$.\nStep 5: \nThe fraction $\\frac{135}{150}$ can be simplified further by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15. This simplifies the fraction to $\\frac{9}{10}$.\nStep 6: \nThe fraction $\\frac{9}{10}$ is already in its simplest form, so the probability that the selected number is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",
