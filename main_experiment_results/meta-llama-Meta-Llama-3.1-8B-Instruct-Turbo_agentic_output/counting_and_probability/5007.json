    "problem": "What is the largest $2$-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$?\n",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Expanding the binomial coefficient, we get ${200 \\choose 100}=\\frac{200!}{100!100!}$. Let the required prime be $p$; then $10 \\le p < 100$. If $p > 50$, then the factor of $p$ appears twice in the denominator. Thus, we need $p$ to appear as a factor at least three times in the numerator, so $3p<200$. The largest such prime is $\\boxed{61}$, which is our answer.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest 2-digit prime factor of $n = {200\\choose 100}$, we first need to calculate or determine the value of $n$. \n\nHowever, to simplify the computation, we can use the fact that ${200\\choose 100} = \\frac{200!}{100!100!}$. This can be further simplified by canceling out common factors in the numerator and denominator.\nThe next step is to factorize the remaining terms in 200! after canceling out the common factors in the numerator and denominator. The prime factorization of the remaining terms needs to be determined to find the largest 2-digit prime factor.\n\nThe remaining terms can be expressed as:\n$\\frac{200 \\times 199 \\times 198 \\times ... \\times 101}{100 \\times 99 \\times 98 \\times ... \\times 1}$\nThe next step is to identify and factorize the terms that contribute to the 2-digit prime factors. It can be observed that the terms from 101 to 99 will contribute 97 to the prime factorization. This is because 97 is a prime number and will not be canceled out by any terms in the denominator. Further simplification can be done by considering the prime factorization of 98 and 99.\nThe terms 98 and 99 can be factorized as $2 \\times 7 \\times 7$ and $3 \\times 3 \\times 11$, respectively. However, the term 99 contributes a factor of 3 to the numerator that will be canceled by a factor of 3 in the denominator, so we will not include it in the prime factorization. \n\nThe next step is to consider the prime factorization of the remaining terms from 97 down to 101.\nThe next step is to determine the prime factorization of the remaining terms from 97 down to 101. The term 101 is a prime number and will contribute a factor of 101 to the prime factorization. The term 100 contributes a factor of 2, 5, and 5 to the prime factorization, but the factors of 5 will be canceled by the factors of 5 in the denominator. However, the factor of 2 in 100 will not be canceled, so it will contribute to the prime factorization. \n\nWe need to consider the prime factorization of the remaining terms 97, 96, and the other terms up to 100.\nTo find the prime factorization of the remaining terms from 97 down to 100, we can start by considering the term 97. As it is a prime number, it will contribute a factor of 97 to the prime factorization. The term 96 can be factorized as $2^5 \\times 3$. The term 95 can be factorized as $5 \\times 19$. The term 94 can be factorized as $2 \\times 47$. The term 93 can be factorized as $2 \\times 3 \\times 31$.\nThe next step is to consider the remaining terms, 92 to 91, which can be factorized as $2^2 \\times 23$ and $2 \\times 13 \\times 7$ respectively. Since no other 2-digit prime factors appear in the prime factorization of the remaining terms, we can now consider the 2-digit prime factors that appear in the prime factorization of the remaining terms.\nThe largest 2-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$ can be determined by identifying the largest 2-digit prime factor that appears in the prime factorization of the remaining terms. The 2-digit prime factors in the prime factorization of the remaining terms are 97, 89, 83, 79, 73, 71, 67, 61, 59, 53, 47, 43, 41, 37, 31, 29, 23, 19, and 17. Among these, the largest 2-digit prime factor is 97, but 97 does not appear in the numerator, hence we look to the next largest prime factor which does appear in the numerator.\nSince 97 does not appear in the numerator, the next largest 2-digit prime factor to consider is 89. To confirm whether 89 appears in the numerator, we need to check if there are any factors of 89 in the remaining terms from 88 down to 1. \n\nWe know that 89 is a prime number and will not be canceled out by any terms in the denominator. The term 88 can be factorized as $2^3 \\times 11$. The term 87 can be factorized as $3 \\times 29$. The term 86 can be factorized as $2 \\times 43$. The term 85 can be factorized as $5 \\times 17$. The term 84 can be factorized as $2^3 \\times 3 \\times 7$. The term 83 can be factorized as a prime number. The term 82 can be factorized as $2 \\times 41$. The term 81 can be factorized as $3^4$.
