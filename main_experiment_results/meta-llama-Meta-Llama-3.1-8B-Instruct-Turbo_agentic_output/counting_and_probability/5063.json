    "problem": "The cards in a stack of $2n$ cards are numbered consecutively from 1 through $2n$ from top to bottom. The top $n$ cards are removed, kept in order, and form pile $A.$ The remaining cards form pile $B.$ The cards are then restacked by taking cards alternately from the tops of pile $B$ and $A,$ respectively. In this process, card number $(n+1)$ becomes the bottom card of the new stack, card number 1 is on top of this card, and so on, until piles $A$ and $B$ are exhausted. If, after the restacking process, at least one card from each pile occupies the same position that it occupied in the original stack, the stack is named magical. For example, eight cards form a magical stack because cards number 3 and number 6 retain their original positions. Find the number of cards in the magical stack in which card number 131 retains its original position.\n",

    "solution": "Since a card from B is placed on the bottom of the new stack, notice that cards from pile B will be marked as an even number in the new pile, while cards from pile A will be marked as odd in the new pile. Since 131 is odd and retains its original position in the stack, it must be in pile A. Also to retain its original position, exactly $131 - 1 = 130$ numbers must be in front of it. There are $\\frac{130}{2} = 65$ cards from each of piles A, B in front of card 131. This suggests that $n = 131 + 65 = 196$; the total number of cards is $196 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{392}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand how the positions of the cards change when they are restacked. When card k from pile A is placed on top of card j from pile B, the new position of card k is k + (2j - 1), and the new position of card j is j + n + (k - n). \n\nWe need to find the values of j and k such that card number 131 retains its original position, which is 131.\nTo find the values of j and k such that card number 131 retains its original position, we need to find j and k such that 131 = k + (2j - 1) or 131 = j + n + (k - n). \n\nFor the second equation, we can rewrite it as 131 = j + (k - n) + n, which simplifies to 131 = j + k.\nSince 131 cannot be equal to j + k (because j and k are both positive integers and 2n is the total number of cards, which is greater than 131), we only need to consider the first equation: 131 = k + (2j - 1).\nWe can rewrite the first equation as 132 = k + 2j. Since 132 and 2 are relatively prime, we can conclude that k must be congruent to 0 modulo 2, and 2j must be congruent to 0 modulo 132. Therefore, k must be an even number.\n\nWe also know that 1 \u2264 k \u2264 2n, and since k is even, we can write k = 2m, where 1 \u2264 m \u2264 n. Substituting this into the equation 132 = k + 2j gives 132 = 2m + 2j.\nTo solve for j, we need to isolate it in the equation 132 = 2m + 2j. \n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives 66 = m + j.\nTo solve for j, we can isolate it by subtracting m from both sides of the equation 66 = m + j, which gives us 66 - m = j. Since 1 \u2264 m \u2264 n, we need to find the value of m that satisfies this equation and the condition that 66 - m is a non-negative integer.\nWe now need to find the value of m that satisfies the equation 66 - m = j, where j is non-negative. Since 1 \u2264 m \u2264 n, we can set m = n, which results in n \u2265 66. This means we need to find the smallest n that satisfies n \u2265 66. Since n is an integer, we can let n = 66. \n\nTo find the total number of cards in the stack, we need to multiply n by 2, since there are 2n cards in the stack.\nNow that we have found $n = 66$, we can find the total number of cards in the stack. To do this, we multiply $n$ by $2$.\n\nSo, the total number of cards in the stack is $2n = 2 \\times 66 = \\boxed{132}$.\nWe now have n = 66, so the total number of cards in the stack is 2n = 2 * 66 = 132.\nWe multiply $n$ by $2$ to find the total number of cards in the stack. \n\n$2n = 2 \\times 66 = 132$",
