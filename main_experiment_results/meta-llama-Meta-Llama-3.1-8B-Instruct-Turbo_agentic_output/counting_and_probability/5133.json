    "solution": "We take as our universe the set of 10-digit integers whose digits are all either 1 or 2, of which there are $2^{10}$, and we count the complement. The complement is the set of 10-digit positive integers composed of the digits 1 and 2 with no two consecutive 1s. Counting such numbers is a popular combinatorial problem: we approach it via a recursion.\nThere are two \"good\" one-digit numbers (1 and 2) and three good two-digit numbers (12, 21 and 22). Each such $n$-digit number is formed either by gluing \"2\" on to the end of a good $(n - 1)$-digit number or by gluing \"21\" onto the end of a good $(n - 2)$-digit number. This is a bijection between the good $n$-digit numbers and the union of the good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. Thus, the number of good $n$-digit numbers is the sum of the number of good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. The resulting recursion is exactly that of the Fibonacci numbers with initial values $F_1 = 2$ and $F_2 = 3$.\nThus, our final answer is $2^{10} - F_{10} = 1024 - 144 = \\boxed{880}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will first find the total number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2. This is equivalent to the number of binary strings of length 10. \n\nThere are 2 possibilities (1 or 2) for each of the 10 digits, so the total number is 2^10 = 1024.\nTo solve this problem, we will use complementary counting. We will find the total number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2, and have no two consecutive 1's, then subtract this number from the total number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2.\nTo find the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2, and have no two consecutive 1's, we can define a sequence where $a_n$ denotes the number of $n$-digit integers with no two consecutive 1's. We can derive a recurrence relation by considering how an $(n+1)$-digit number without two consecutive 1's can be constructed from an $n$-digit number. This can be done by appending a 2 to the $n$-digit number, resulting in $a_n$ possibilities. Alternatively, an $(n+1)$-digit number can be constructed by appending a 1 to the end of an $n$-digit number with no 1's in the last two positions. This can be done in $a_{n-1}$ ways. Thus, the recurrence relation is $a_{n+1} = a_n + a_{n-1}$.\nWe can solve the recurrence relation using the characteristic equation method. The characteristic equation is $r^2 - r - 1 = 0$, which has solutions $r = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $r = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Using the general solution for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients, the general solution for the recurrence relation is $a_n = A(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2})^n + B(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2})^n$. We can use the initial conditions $a_1 = 2$ and $a_2 = 3$ to determine the constants $A$ and $B$.\nTo determine the constants $A$ and $B$, we can use the initial conditions. We have $a_1 = 2 = A(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2})^1 + B(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2})^1$ and $a_2 = 3 = A(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2})^2 + B(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2})^2$. Solving this system of equations will give us the values of $A$ and $B$.\n\nWe can start by solving for $A$ and $B$ using the system of equations.\nTo solve for $A$ and $B$, we can use the system of equations:\n1) $A(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2})^1 + B(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2})^1 = 2$\n2) $A(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2})^2 + B(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2})^2 = 3$\n\nWe can simplify equation 1) by multiplying $A$ with $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $B$ with $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ to get an equation with integer coefficients. \n\nEquation 1 becomes:\n1) $\\frac{A(1 + \\sqrt{5})}{2} + \\frac{B(1 - \\sqrt{5})}{2} = 2$\nTo solve for $A$ and $B$, we can simplify the equation further by multiplying both sides by 2 and then multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of the fractions by the conjugate of 1 + \u221a5 and 1 - \u221a5 respectively. This is done to get rid of the radical in the denominators. \n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by 1 - \u221a5, and the second fraction by 1 + \u221a5, we get:\n\n1) $\\frac{A(1 + \\sqrt{5})}{2} \\times \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{1 - \\sqrt{5}} + \\frac{B(1 - \\sqrt{5})}{2} \\times \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{1 + \\sqrt{5}} = 2$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n1) $\\frac{A(1 - 5)}{2} + \\frac{B(1 + 5)}{2} = 2$\n\n1) $\\frac{A(-4)}{2} + \\frac{B(6)}{2} = 2$\n\n1) $\\frac{-4A}{2\nTo solve for $A$ and $B$, we can simplify the equation further.
