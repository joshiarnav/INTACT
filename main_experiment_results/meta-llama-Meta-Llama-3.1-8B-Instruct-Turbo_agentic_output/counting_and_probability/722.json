    "problem": "Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We have two cases because if the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$, it could be an ace or not be an ace.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{3}{51} = \\dfrac{1}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the three remaining aces, which gives a probability of $\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot \\dfrac{1}{17} = \\dfrac{1}{884}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{12}{52} = \\dfrac{3}{13}$ chance that a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the ace is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{4}{51}$ chance that an ace is drawn second, giving a $\\dfrac{3}{13}\\cdot \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{4}{221}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nSo the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\\dfrac{1}{884} + \\dfrac{4}{221} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}$.\n\nNotice that we can avoid some of the large denominators above by organizing this computation as follows: $$\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{3}{51}+\\dfrac{12}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{1\\cdot 3+12\\cdot 4}{52\\cdot 51} = \\dfrac{51}{52\\cdot 51}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}.$$",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Determine the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$. \nThere are 52 cards in a standard deck and 13 of them are $\\diamondsuit$. So, the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ is $\\frac{13}{52}$ or $\\frac{1}{4}$.\nStep 2:  After the first card is drawn, there are 51 cards left in the deck, and 4 of them are aces. We need to consider two cases:\n- Case 1: The first card drawn is the ace of $\\diamondsuit$. In this case, the probability that the second card is an ace is $\\frac{3}{51}$.\n- Case 2: The first card drawn is a $\\diamondsuit$ that is not an ace. In this case, the probability that the second card is an ace is $\\frac{4}{51}$.\nThe probability of the first card being the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is $\\frac{1}{52}$, and the probability of the first card being a $\\diamondsuit$ that is not an ace is $\\frac{12}{52}$.\n\nSo, the overall probability is: \n$\\left(\\frac{1}{52}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{51}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{12}{52}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{51}\\right)$\nStep 3:  Simplify the expression to find the final probability.\nThe expression is: \n$\\left(\\frac{1}{52}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{51}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{12}{52}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{51}\\right)$\nSimplifying, we get: \n$\\frac{3}{2652} + \\frac{48}{2652} = \\frac{51}{2652} = \\frac{1}{52}$\nStep 4:  Since we have already determined that the probability of the first card being a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card being an ace is $\\frac{1}{52}$, this is indeed the final probability.\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{52}}$",
