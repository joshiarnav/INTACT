    "problem": "Seven people arrive to dinner, but the circular table only seats six.  If two seatings such that one is a rotation of the other are considered the same, then in how many different ways can we choose six people and seat them at the table?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing.  To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person.  This suggests that there are $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people.  However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count.  Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table.  There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.",

    "model_solution": "To solve the problem, first choose 6 out of the 7 people to sit at the table. This can be done in 7 choose 6 ways, which is calculated as:\n\n7C6 = 7! / (6! * (7-6)!)\n= 7! / (6! * 1!)\n= 7\nOnce 6 people are chosen, there are 6! ways to arrange them around the circular table. However, because rotations of the same arrangement are considered the same, we must divide by the number of rotations, which is 6. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is 6!/6.\nNow, calculate 6!/6, which simplifies to 5! (since 6!/6 = 6 * 5!). Then, compute the value of 5!, which is:\n\n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\nTo find the total number of different ways to choose six people and seat them at the table, we multiply the number of ways to choose six people (7) by the number of ways to arrange them around the circular table (120).\nTo find the total number of different ways to choose six people and seat them at the table, we multiply the number of ways to choose six people (7) by the number of ways to arrange them around the circular table (120). So, the total number of ways is 7 * 120 = 840.\nTo find the total number of different ways to choose six people and seat them at the table, we multiply the number of ways to choose six people (7) by the number of ways to arrange them around the circular table (120), so the total number of ways is 7 * 120 = 840.\nThe total number of different ways to choose six people and seat them at the table is the product of the number of ways to choose six people and the number of ways to arrange them around the circular table, which is $7 * 120 = 840$.\nNow, multiply the number of ways to choose six people (7) by the number of ways to arrange them around the circular table (120).\nThe total number of different ways to choose six people and seat them at the table is the product of the number of ways to choose six people and the number of ways to arrange them around the circular table, which is $7 * 120 = 840$.",
