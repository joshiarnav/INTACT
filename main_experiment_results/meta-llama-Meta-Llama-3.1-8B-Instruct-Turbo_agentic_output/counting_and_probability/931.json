    "problem": "When two fair 6-sided dice are tossed, the numbers $a$ and $b$ are obtained. What is the probability that the two digit number $ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) and $a$ and $b$ are all divisible by 3?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "$ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) is divisible by 3 only when $a+b$ is divisible by 3. Since 3 divides both $a$ and $a+b$, 3 must divide $b$. Therefore, $a$ and $b$ can equal 3 or 6. The probability that $a$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. The probability that $b$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. Therefore, The probability that both $a$ and $b$ equal 3 or 6 is $\\left(\\frac13\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac19}$.",
