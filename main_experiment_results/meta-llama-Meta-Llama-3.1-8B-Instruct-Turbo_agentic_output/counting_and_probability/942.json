    "model_solution": "To solve the problem, let's first consider the maximum difference that can be achieved by subtracting two distinct members of the set. This occurs when we subtract 1 from 16, giving a difference of 15.\n\nNow, consider the minimum difference that can be achieved by subtracting two distinct members of the set. This occurs when we subtract consecutive integers, such as 1 from 2, giving a difference of 1.\n\nSince we want to find the number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set, we will consider the differences that can be achieved between 1 and 15, inclusive.\nSince we want to find the number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set, we need to find the number of integers from 1 to 15 that can be achieved. \n\nConsider the difference $16 - x$, for any $x$ in the set. The smallest value of $x$ that gives a difference in this interval is $x = 1$, which gives $16 - 1 = 15$. The largest value of $x$ that gives a difference in this interval is $x = 2$, which gives $16 - 2 = 14$. If we continue moving $x$ up by 1, we'll get all the numbers between 13 and 1, inclusive. Thus, the number of integers we can get is the number of integers between 13 and 1, inclusive, plus the integer we get from $16 - 1$, which is 15.\nTo find the number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set, we need to count the number of integers in the interval from 1 to 15. \n\nWe know that we can get the numbers from 13 down to 1, inclusive, by moving x up by 1. So, the number of integers in this interval is 13. We also need to add the integer 15 to this count. Therefore, the total number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set is 13 + 1 = 14.\nWe have counted the integers from 13 to 1, inclusive, and added 15. Now we need to confirm that we have not missed any integers between 1 and 15, inclusive, that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set.\nWe have already considered the maximum and minimum possible differences and have counted all differences between 13 and 1, inclusive, and added 15. To confirm that we have not missed any other integers between 1 and 15, we can consider the differences that can be achieved by subtracting 1 from each number in the set, which gives the sequence 15, 14, 13, ..., 2, 1. Since we have already counted these differences, and have also added 15, we can conclude that we have not missed any other integers between 1 and 15, inclusive.\nSince we have confirmed that we have not missed any other integers between 1 and 15, inclusive, our final count of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set is 14.\nWe have confirmed that the differences 1 through 13 and 15 can be achieved by subtracting two distinct members of the set. Now we need to check if any integers between the differences of 1 and 15, and the differences of 2 and 14, can be achieved. The differences of 2 and 14 can be achieved by subtracting 2 from 16 and 4 from 16, respectively, but these differences have already been counted.\nSince we have confirmed that the differences 1 through 13 and 15 can be achieved by subtracting two distinct members of the set, and we have also considered the differences that can be achieved by subtracting 1 from each number in the set (which gives the sequence 15, 14, 13, ..., 2, 1), we can conclude that we have not missed any other integers between 1 and 15, inclusive.\nSince we have confirmed that we have not missed any other integers between 1 and 15, inclusive, our final count of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set is 14.",
