Since $[BCD] = [ADC]$, we have $[BCE] + [CDE] = [ADE] + [CDE]$, so  $[BCE] = [ADE] = 20$.\n\nTo find the area of triangle $CDE$, we note that triangles $CDE$ and $ABE$ are similar, and the ratio of their sides is $DE/BE$. Triangles $ADE$ and $ABE$ share an altitude, so $DE/BE = [ADE]/[ABE] = 20/50 = 2/5$. Since the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their sides, $[CDE]/[ABE] = (DE/BE)^2 = 4/25$, and $[CDE] = (4/25)[ABE] = (4/25)(50) = 8$. Thus, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $[ABE] + [ADE] + [BCE] + [CDE] = 50+20+20+8 = \\boxed{98}$.",
