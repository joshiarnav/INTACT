    "problem": "The area of an equilateral triangle is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides. What is the perimeter of the triangle, in units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$. This must equal $s$. Setting the two equal and solving, we get \\begin{align*}\ns&=\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\\\\n4s&=s^2\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4 &= s\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4\\sqrt{3}&= 3s \\\\\n\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} &=s\n\\end{align*} Thus, the perimeter of the triangle is $3s=\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}} \\text{units}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's denote the side length of the equilateral triangle as 's'. The area (A) of the equilateral triangle is given by the formula A = (\u221a3/4)s^2.\nSet the area formula equal to 's' and solve for 's': (\u221a3/4)s^2 = s. Rearranging gives (\u221a3/4)s^2 - s = 0. Factoring out 's' yields s((\u221a3/4)s - 1) = 0.\nSince s is a side length and cannot be zero, we can set (\u221a3/4)s - 1 = 0 and solve for 's': (\u221a3/4)s = 1. Multiplying both sides by 4/\u221a3 gives s = 4/\u221a3. To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by \u221a3: s = (4/\u221a3) * (\u221a3/\u221a3) = 4\u221a3/3.\nSince we've found 's', the side length of the equilateral triangle, we can now find the perimeter, which is 3 times the side length: Perimeter = 3s = 3 * (4\u221a3/3) = 4\u221a3.\nThe perimeter of the equilateral triangle is indeed 4\u221a3 units, but this solution assumes that the side length s is in units. To clarify, if 's' is in some unit (e.g., cm), then the perimeter will be 4\u221a3 units in that same unit.\nSince we've found the perimeter as 4\u221a3, this is our solution.\nSince we've found the perimeter as 4\u221a3 units, this is our solution.\nSince we've found the perimeter as $4\\sqrt{3}$ units, this is our solution.\nSince we've found the perimeter as 4\u221a3 units, this is our solution.",
