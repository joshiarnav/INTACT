    "problem": "Square $ABCD$ has side length $1$ unit.  Points $E$ and $F$ are on sides $AB$ and $CB$, respectively, with $AE = CF$.  When the square is folded along the lines $DE$ and $DF$, sides $AD$ and $CD$ coincide and lie on diagonal $BD$.  The length of segment $AE$ can be expressed in the form $\\sqrt{k}-m$ units. What is the integer value of $k+m$?",

    "solution": "We start by drawing a diagram.  When the paper is folded, sides $AD$ and $CD$ coincide on the longer dashed line, and points $A$ and $C$ meet at $G$, as you can see below.  [asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(1,.4)); draw((0,0)--(.4,1));\ndraw((1,.4)--(.4,1),dashed);\ndraw((0,0)--(.7,.7),dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,1), NW); label(\"$B$\",(1,1), NE); label(\"$C$\",(1,0), SE); label(\"$D$\",(0,0), SW);\nlabel(\"$F$\",(1,.4), E); label(\"$E$\",(.4,1), N);\nlabel(\"$G$\",(.7,.7), NE);\n[/asy] Now, we assign variables.  We are looking for the length of $AE$, so let $AE=x$.  Then, $BE=1-x$.  Because of the symmetry of the square and the fold, everything to the left of line $BD$ is a mirror image of everything to the right of $BD$.  Thus, $\\triangle BEF$ is an isosceles right triangle (45-45-90), so $EF=\\sqrt{2}EB = \\sqrt{2}(1-x)$.  Also, $\\triangle EGB$ and $\\triangle FGB$ are congruent 45-45-90 triangles, so $GB = \\frac{EB}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nAlso, notice that because the way the paper is folded (its original position versus its final position), we have more congruent triangles, $\\triangle AED \\cong \\triangle GED$.  This means that $AD=GD=1$.\n\nLastly, notice that since $G$ is on $BD$, we have $BD=BG+GD$. $BD$ is a diagonal of the square, so it has side length $\\sqrt{2}$, $GD=1$, and $GB = \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}$.  Thus, our equation becomes \\[\\sqrt{2} = 1 + \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}.\\] Multiplying both sides by $\\sqrt{2}$ yields $2=\\sqrt{2}+1-x$; solving for $x$ yields $x=\\sqrt{2}-1$.  Thus, $AE=\\sqrt{2}-1=\\sqrt{k}-m$, and we see that $k+m=2+1=\\boxed{3}$.",
