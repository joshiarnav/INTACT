We also need to find the height of $\\triangle CDB$, which is the altitude from $D$ to $CB$. To do this, we use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $\\triangle ABC$.\nSince $AC=BC=7$ and $AB=2$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle ABC$ to find the height of $\\triangle ABC$, which is also the height of $\\triangle CDB$.

Since $x$ represents the length of $BD$, we have found that $BD = \\sqrt{19}$, but this is not required as we can leave it as $\\sqrt{19}$ but using the surd found the decimal equivalent for the surd, we find the approximate decimal value of $BD$ is $\\boxed{4.3589}$ rounded to 4 decimal places",
