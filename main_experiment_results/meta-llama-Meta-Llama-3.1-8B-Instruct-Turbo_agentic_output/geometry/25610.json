    "model_solution": "Let's denote the length, width, and height of the rectangular box as $l$, $w$, and $h$ respectively. \n\nThe sum of the lengths of the twelve edges of the box is $140$, so we can write the equation $4(l + w + h) = 140$. This simplifies to $l + w + h = 35$.\nWe know that the distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner is $21$, which can be represented as $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = 21$, and squaring both sides gives $l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = 441$.\nWe can use the equation $l + w + h = 35$ and the equation $l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = 441$ to solve for the surface area. By squaring the equation $l + w + h = 35$, we get $(l + w + h)^2 = 1225$, which expands to $l^2 + w^2 + h^2 + 2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 1225$. Substituting $l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = 441$ into this equation gives $441 + 2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 1225$. Simplifying further, we get $2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 784$.\nWe can rewrite the equation $2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 784$ as $2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 392 \\times 2$. Dividing both sides by $2$, we get $lw + lh + wh = 392$. The surface area of the box is given by $2(lw + lh + wh)$.\nWe can now substitute $lw + lh + wh = 392$ into the expression for the surface area, giving us $2(lw + lh + wh) = 2(392)$, which simplifies to $2(392) = 784$.\nThe surface area of the box is given by $2(lw + lh + wh)$, and we have found that $lw + lh + wh = 392$. \n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 2, we get the final expression for the surface area of the box, which is $2 \\times 392 = 784$.\nThe next step is to evaluate the expression $2 \\times 392$ to find the surface area of the box.\nTo find the surface area of the box, we need to calculate $2 \\times 392$. Multiplying $2$ by $392$ gives us $784$.\nThe next step is to evaluate the expression $2 \\times 392$ to find the surface area of the box.",
