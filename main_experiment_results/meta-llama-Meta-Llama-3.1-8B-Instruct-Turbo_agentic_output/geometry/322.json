    "problem": "The radius of a cylinder is doubled and its height is tripled. If its original volume was 10 cubic feet, what is its volume now, in cubic feet?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively.  The new cylinder has volume \\[\n\\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\\pi r^2 h,\n\\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume.  Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where V is the volume, \u03c0 (pi) is a constant, r is the radius, and h is the height.\nStep 2: Since the radius is doubled and the height is tripled, the new volume V' can be expressed as V' = \u03c0(2r)\u00b2(3h) = 12\u03c0r\u00b2h.\nStep 3: Now we can find the new volume by substituting the original volume V = 10\u03c0r\u00b2h into the equation V' = 12\u03c0r\u00b2h, giving us V' = 12 * 10\u03c0r\u00b2h = 120\u03c0r\u00b2h.\nStep 4: Cancel out the common terms \u03c0r\u00b2h from the equation V' = 120\u03c0r\u00b2h, leaving V' = 120V, where V is the original volume of 10 cubic feet. Therefore, V' = 120 * 10 = 1200.\nStep 5: Given that the original volume V = 10 cubic feet, we can now find the new volume by substituting V into the equation V' = 120V, which gives us V' = 120 * 10 = 1200.\nStep 6: Since the original volume is 10 cubic feet, we can now find the new volume by calculating V' = 120 * 10 = 1200 cubic feet.\nStep 7: The new volume V' is now 1200 cubic feet.\nStep 8: Since the new volume V' is 1200 cubic feet, we have found our solution.\nStep 9: Therefore, the new volume of the cylinder is 1200 cubic feet.\nStep 10: Therefore, the new volume of the cylinder is $\\boxed{1200}$ cubic feet.",
