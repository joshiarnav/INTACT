The base has side $10$, so the diagonal will satisfy: $$d^2=10^2+10^2=200$$ $$d=10\\sqrt{2}$$ Half of this is $5\\sqrt{2}$.  Now we can look at the right triangle formed by the altitude from the vertex of the pyramid, the line just drawn in, and with hypotenuse as the edge we need to find the length of.  The length of this edge is: $$\\sqrt{12^2+(5\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{144+50}=\\sqrt{194}\\approx 13.928$$ The total length of all edges is: $$4(10)+4(13.928)\\approx \\boxed{ 96}$$",
