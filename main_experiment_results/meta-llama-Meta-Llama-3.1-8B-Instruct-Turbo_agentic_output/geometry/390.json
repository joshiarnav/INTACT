We are given that this equals 12, so we find $x = 12/\\sqrt{6} = 2\\sqrt{6}$.  It follows that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ can be found via  \\[(1/2)(AC)(BD)=(1/2)(x+x\\sqrt{3})(x\\sqrt{3})=12\\sqrt{3}+36.\\] To find $EC$, notice that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ can also be written as $(1/2)(AB)(EC)$.  Thus, \\[(1/2)(4\\sqrt{6})(EC)=12\\sqrt{3}+36 \\Rightarrow EC = 3(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}).\\]  Hence $a=3$, $b=2$, and $c=6$, so $a+b+c=\\boxed{11}$.",
