    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ has a perimeter of 2007 units. The sides have lengths that are all integer values with $AB< BC \\leq AC$. What is the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Since $AB$ and $BC$ are positive integers and $AB < BC$, $BC - AB$ must be at least 1.\n\nThe triangle with side lengths $AB = 650$, $BC = 651$, and $AC = 706$ satisfies the given conditions, and for this triangle $BC - AB = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To find the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$, we should first consider the properties of a triangle's sides. The triangle inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. This implies $AB + BC > AC$, $AB + AC > BC$, and $BC + AC > AB$. \n\nGiven a perimeter of 2007, we can express the length of side $AC$ as $2007 - AB - BC$. To find a suitable approach, let's examine some initial conditions that could help us narrow down possible values for $AB$ and $BC$.\nSince we want the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$, let's consider the case where $AB + BC$ is as close to $AC$ as possible, but still satisfies the triangle inequality. We can start by letting $AB = BC - k$, where $k$ is a positive integer representing the difference between $BC$ and $AB$.\nWe substitute $AB = BC - k$ and $AC = 2007 - AB - BC$ into the triangle inequality $AB + BC > AC$. This gives us $(BC - k) + BC > 2007 - BC - k$, which simplifies to $2BC - k > 2007 - k$ and then $2BC > 2007$. However, we know that $BC \\leq AC$, so $BC \\leq 1003.5$. Since $BC$ is an integer, the maximum possible value for $BC$ is 1003, making $2BC - k \\leq 2006$ and $k \\leq 2BC - 2006$. Since we want the smallest possible value of $BC - AB = k$, we want to find the minimum possible value of $k$. We also know that $k$ is a positive integer, so $k \\geq 1$.\nSince $k \\leq 2BC - 2006$ and $k \\geq 1$, let's consider the case where $k$ is minimized. We want to find the smallest value of $BC$ that satisfies $2BC > 2007$, since $BC$ is an integer. The smallest possible value for $BC$ that satisfies this condition is $BC = 1004$, and the corresponding value for $k$ is $k = 2(1004) - 2006 = 2$.\nTo confirm if this value of $k$ is indeed the smallest possible, we need to check if it satisfies the other two triangle inequalities: $AB + AC > BC$ and $BC + AC > AB$. Since $AB = BC - k$ and $AC = 2007 - AB - BC$, we substitute these expressions into the inequalities.\n\nLet's start with $AB + AC > BC$. This gives us $(BC - k) + (2007 - BC - (BC - k)) > BC$, which simplifies to $2007 > BC$. However, we already know that $BC = 1004$.\n\nWe then check the inequality $BC + AC > AB$. Substituting the expressions for $AC$ and $AB$, we get $BC + (2007 - BC - (BC - k)) > BC - k$, which simplifies to $2007 + k > BC$. Substituting $BC = 1004$ and $k = 2$, we get $2009 > 1006$, which is true.\n\nSince both inequalities are satisfied, the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
