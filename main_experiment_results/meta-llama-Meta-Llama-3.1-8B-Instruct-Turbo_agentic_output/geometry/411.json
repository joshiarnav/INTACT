    "solution": "$\\angle CDF = \\angle AEB$ and $\\angle BAE = \\angle CFD$, so we know that $\\bigtriangleup AEB \\sim \\bigtriangleup FDC$.  Thus, denoting the side length of $BEFC$ as $x$, we can create the ratios: $\\frac{28}{x} = \\frac{x}{58} \\Rightarrow x^2 = 1624$, and since $x^2$ is the area of square $BCFE$, $\\boxed{1624}$ is the answer.",

This is because they share angle $C$ and both have a right angle, making their third angles congruent.\nStep 2:  Because triangles $FDC$ and $AEB$ are similar, we can set up the following proportion: \n$$\\frac{x}{58} = \\frac{28}{x}.$$\nThis allows us to solve for the side length $x$ of the square.\nStep 3:  Solving for $x$ in the proportion, we get: $x^2 = 58 \\times 28$.
