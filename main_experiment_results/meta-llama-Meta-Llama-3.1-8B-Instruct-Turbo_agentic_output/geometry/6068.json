    "problem": "Let $ABCD$ and $BCFG$ be two faces of a cube with $AB=12$. A beam of light emanates from vertex $A$ and reflects off face $BCFG$ at point $P$, which is 7 units from $\\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\\overline{BC}$. The beam continues to be reflected off the faces of the cube. The length of the light path from the time it leaves point $A$ until it next reaches a vertex of the cube is given by $m\\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n$.\n",

    "solution": "When a light beam reflects off a surface, the path is like that of a ball bouncing. Picture that, and also imagine X, Y, and Z coordinates for the cube vertices. The coordinates will all involve 0's and 12's only, so that means that the X, Y, and Z distance traveled by the light must all be divisible by 12. Since the light's Y changes by 5 and the X changes by 7 (the Z changes by 12, don't worry about that), and 5 and 7 are relatively prime to 12, the light must make 12 reflections onto the XY plane or the face parallel to the XY plane.\nIn each reflection, the distance traveled by the light is $\\sqrt{ (12^2) + (5^2) + (7^2) }$ = $\\sqrt{218}$. This happens 12 times, so the total distance is $12\\sqrt{218}$. $m=12$ and $n=218$, so therefore, the answer is $m+n=\\boxed{230}$.",

To analyze this, consider the cube from a different perspective, such as a 2D representation. \n\nThe path of the light beam can be represented as a series of line segments connecting its reflections on the cube's faces. Since the cube is a regular 3D shape, we can use symmetry to find the coordinates of the reflection point $P$ on face $BCFG$. \n\nLet's place the cube in a coordinate system so that $B$ is at the origin, $C$ lies on the positive $x$-axis, and $F$ is at the point $(12,12,0)$. The coordinates of $P$ are $(5,7,0)$, as it is 7 units from $\\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\\overline{BC}$.\nThe next step is to find the equation of the line that represents the beam of light from $A$ to its first reflection point $P$. To do this, we can use the coordinates of $A$ and $P$ to find the direction vector of the line. Since $A$ has coordinates $(12,0,0)$ and $P$ has coordinates $(5,7,0)$, the direction vector of the line is $\\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ 7 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nNow that we have the direction vector of the line, we can find the parametric equation of the line in 3D space.

We can find the intersection point by equating the parametric equation of the line to the equation of the face. \n\nSince the light beam reflects off face $BCFG$, we need to find the intersection point of the line with this face. The equation of face $BCFG$ can be represented as $x = 12, y = 0$. We can substitute these values into the parametric equation of the line to find the value of the parameter $t$ at the intersection point.\n\nEquating the parametric equation of the line to the equation of the face, we get $12 - 7t = 12, 7t = 0$. Solving these equations, we find that $t = 0$. However, this is the starting point of the line and not the reflection point.
