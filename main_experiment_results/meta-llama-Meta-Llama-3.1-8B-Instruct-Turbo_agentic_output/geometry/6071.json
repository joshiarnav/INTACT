    "solution": "Let the smaller angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$ be $\\theta$. Note that the centers of the two circles lie on the angle bisector of the angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$. Also note that if $(x,y)$ is on said angle bisector, we have that $\\frac{y}{x}=\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}$. Let $\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=m_1$, for convenience. Therefore if $(x,y)$ is on the angle bisector, then $x=\\frac{y}{m_1}$. Now let the centers of the two relevant circles be $(a/m_1 , a)$ and $(b/m_1 , b)$ for some positive reals $a$ and $b$. These two circles are tangent to the $x$-axis, so the radii of the circles are $a$ and $b$ respectively. We know that the point $(9,6)$ is a point on both circles, so we have that\n\\[(9-\\frac{a}{m_1})^2+(6-a)^2=a^2\\]\n\\[(9-\\frac{b}{m_1})^2+(6-b)^2=b^2\\]\nExpanding these and manipulating terms gives\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}a^2-[(18/m_1)+12]a+117=0\\]\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}b^2-[(18/m_1)+12]b+117=0\\]\nIt follows that $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the quadratic\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}x^2-[(18/m_1)+12]x+117=0\\]\nIt follows from Vieta's Formulas that the product of the roots of this quadratic is $117m_1^2$, but we were also given that the product of the radii was 68. Therefore $68=117m_1^2$, or $m_1^2=\\frac{68}{117}$. Note that the half-angle formula for tangents is\n\\[\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\cos{\\theta}}{1+\\cos{\\theta}}}\\]\nTherefore\n\\[\\frac{68}{117}=\\frac{1-\\cos{\\theta}}{1+\\cos{\\theta}}\\]\nSolving for $\\cos{\\theta}$ gives that $\\cos{\\theta}=\\frac{49}{185}$. It then follows that $\\sin{\\theta}=\\sqrt{1-\\cos^2{\\theta}}=\\frac{12\\sqrt{221}}{185}$.\nIt then follows that $m=\\tan{\\theta}=\\frac{12\\sqrt{221}}{49}$. Therefore $a=12$, $b=221$, and $c=49$. The desired answer is then $12+221+49=\\boxed{282}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let the equations of the two circles be $(x - x_{1})^{2} + (y - y_{1})^{2} = r_{1}^{2}$ and $(x - x_{2})^{2} + (y - y_{2})^{2} = r_{2}^{2}$, where $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and $(x_{2}, y_{2})$ are the centers of the circles. We also know that the points of tangency are on the x-axis and the line $y = mx$.\nStep 2: Since the x-axis and the line $y = mx$ are tangent to both circles, the radius of each circle is perpendicular to the tangent line. We can represent the centers of the circles as $(a, r_{1})$ and $(b, r_{2})$, where $a$ and $b$ are the x-coordinates of the centers. This allows us to set up the equations for the circles as $(x - a)^{2} + (y - r_{1})^{2} = r_{1}^{2}$ and $(x - b)^{2} + (y - r_{2})^{2} = r_{2}^{2}$. By using the point $(9, 6)$, we can write the equations for the circles as $(x - 9)^{2} + (y - 6)^{2} = r_{1}^{2}$ and $(x - b)^{2} + (y - r_{2})^{2} = r_{2}^{2}$.\nStep 3: Since the line $y = mx$ is tangent to the circle with equation $(x - 9)^{2} + (y - 6)^{2} = r_{1}^{2}$, the radius of this circle is perpendicular to the line $y = mx$, meaning the slope of the radius is $-\\frac{1}{m}$. Using the point $(9,6)$, we can write the equation of the radius as $y = \\frac{6}{9}x - \\frac{6}{9} \\cdot 9 = \\frac{2}{3}x - 2$. The radius of this circle is perpendicular to the radius's slope, so we have $\\frac{r_{1}}{2} = \\frac{2}{3} \\Rightarrow r_{1} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\nStep 4: Since the product of the radii is 68, we have $\\frac{4}{3} \\cdot r_{2} = 68$. Solving for $r_{2}$, we get $r_{2} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 68}{4} = 51$. With the radius of the first circle, we can write the equation of its circle as $(x - 9)^{2} + (y - 6)^{2} = \\frac{16}{9}$. By completing the square, we obtain the equation of the circle in the form of $(x - a)^{2} + (y - b)^{2} = (r)^2$. This allows us to solve for the y-intercept and find the slope of the tangent line.\nStep 5: \nTo find the equation of the tangent line $y = mx$, we complete the square for the circle $(x - 9)^{2} + (y - 6)^{2} = \\frac{16}{9}$. This gives us $(x - 9)^{2} + (y - 6)^{2} = \\frac{16}{9} \\Rightarrow (x - 9)^2 + (y - 6) = \\frac{16}{9} \\Rightarrow (x - 9)^2 + (y - 6)^2 = \\frac{16}{9} \\Rightarrow (x - 9)^2 = \\frac{16}{9} - (y - 6)^2$. We now need to substitute the equation of the tangent line $y = mx$ to solve for $m$.\nStep 6: Substitute $y = mx$ into the equation $(x - 9)^2 + (y - 6)^2 = \\frac{16}{9}$ and simplify to obtain an equation in terms of $x$ and $m$. Since $(x - 9)^2 + (mx - 6)^2 = \\frac{16}{9}$, we can expand and simplify to $(x - 9)^2 + m^2x^2 - 12mx + 36m + 36 = \\frac{16}{9} \\Rightarrow (1 + m^2)x^2 - (12m)x + (36m + 36 - \\frac{16}{9}) = 0$. The line $y = mx$ is tangent to the circle, so this quadratic equation should have exactly one solution. For this equation to have exactly one solution, its discriminant must equal zero, so we have $(12m)^2 - 4(1 + m^2)(36m + 36 - \\frac{16}{9}) = 0$.\nStep 7: Solve the discriminant equation $(12m)^2 - 4(1 + m^2)(36m + 36 - \\frac{16}{9}) = 0$ to find the value of $m$. This equation simplifies to $144m^2 - 4(36m^3 + 144m^2 - \\frac{64}{9}m + \\frac{36}{9}) = 0$. Combine like terms and simplify to obtain the equation in terms of $m$.\nStep 8: Simplify the discriminant equation to $144m^2 - 4(36m^3 + 144m^2 - \\frac{64}{9}m + 4) = 0 \\Rightarrow 144m^2 - 144m^3 - 576m^2 + \\frac{256}{9}m - 16 = 0$.

Now, rearrange the equation to isolate the $m$ term, giving us $-1296m^3 + 256m = 144$. Factor out the common factor of $m$ to obtain $m(-1296m^2 + 256) = 144$.

This is a quadratic equation in the form of $am^2 + bm + c = 0$, where $a = 1296$, $b = -256$, and $c = -144$.
