    "problem": "A triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units. The length of the third side is $x$ units, where $x$ is an integer. What is the largest possible perimeter of the triangle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: According to the Triangle Inequality Theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. So, we must have:\n- 5 + 6 > x\n- 5 + x > 6\n- 6 + x > 5\n\nSimplifying these inequalities, we get:\n- 11 > x\n- x > 1\n- x > -1\n\nSince x is an integer, we can rewrite the first inequality as x < 11.\nStep 2: The second inequality, x > 1, implies that the smallest possible value of x is 2, as x is an integer. The third inequality, x > -1, is always true since x is a positive integer. Therefore, we only need to consider the first inequality, x < 11, and the smallest possible value of x, which is x = 2, to find the largest possible perimeter.\nStep 3: We now need to find the largest possible value of x that satisfies the inequality x < 11. Since x is an integer, we can find the largest possible value of x by setting x = 10 and then calculating the perimeter of the triangle. The perimeter is given by P = 5 + 6 + 10 = 21 units.\nStep 4: Since x = 10 gives the largest possible value of x that satisfies the inequality x < 11, we have found the largest possible perimeter of the triangle.\nStep 5: We have found that the largest possible perimeter of the triangle occurs when x = 10, so the largest possible perimeter is indeed 21 units.\nStep 6: Therefore, the largest possible perimeter of the triangle is $\\boxed{21}$.",
