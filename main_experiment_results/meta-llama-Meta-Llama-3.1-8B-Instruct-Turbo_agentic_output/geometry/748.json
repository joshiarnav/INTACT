    "model_solution": "Step 1: Recall the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is $C = 2 \\pi r$, where $C$ is the circumference and $r$ is the radius of the circle. The given circumference of circle $A$ is 60 feet, so we can set up the equation $60 = 2 \\pi r$.\nStep 2: Solve the equation $60 = 2 \\pi r$ for the radius $r$. This gives us $r = \\frac{60}{2 \\pi} = \\frac{30}{\\pi}$ feet.\nStep 3: The measure of the central angle $\\angle BAC$ is given as 60 degrees. Since the measure of the central angle is directly proportional to the length of its intercepted arc, we can find the length of $\\widehat{BC}$ by using the ratio of the measure of $\\angle BAC$ to 360 degrees. The length of $\\widehat{BC}$ is $\\frac{60}{360} \\times 60$ feet.\nStep 4: Calculate the length of $\\widehat{BC}$ by simplifying the expression: $\\frac{60}{360} \\times \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\times 2\\pi = \\frac{60}{6} = 10$ feet.\nStep 5: \nThe length of $\\widehat{BC}$ is $\\frac{60}{360} \\times 60$ feet, which simplifies to $10$ feet.\nStep 5: Therefore, the length of $\\widehat{BC}$ is $\\frac{60}{360} \\times 60 = \\frac{60}{6} = 10$ feet.\nStep 5: Therefore, the length of $\\widehat{BC}$ is $\\frac{60}{360} \\times 60 = \\frac{60}{6} = 10$ feet.",
