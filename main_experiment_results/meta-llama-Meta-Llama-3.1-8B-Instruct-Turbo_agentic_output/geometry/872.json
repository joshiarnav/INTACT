    "solution": "Since $MC = 8$ and $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$, we have $MB=MC = 8$, so $BC=8+8=16$.  Since $B$ and $C$ trisect $\\overline{AD}$, we have $AB = CD = BC = 16$, so $AD =16+16+16=\\boxed{48}$.",

    "model_solution": "Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, $\\overline{AM}$ has the same length as $\\overline{MD}$, and let's denote this length as $x$.\nSince $B$ and $C$ trisect $\\overline{AD}$, $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{CD}$ each have the same length, and since $\\overline{AM}$ has length $x$, then the lengths of $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{CD}$ would be $\\frac{2x}{3}$, and the length of $\\overline{AD}$ is $x + \\frac{2x}{3} = \\frac{5x}{3}$.\nSince $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$ and $B$ and $C$ trisect $\\overline{AD}$, then the length of $\\overline{AC}$ is also $x$, and $AC = MC + MC = 16$. Therefore, $x = 16$.\nSince $x = 16$, we can find the length of $\\overline{AD}$ by substituting this value into the equation $\\frac{5x}{3}$. Therefore, $\\overline{AD} = \\frac{5(16)}{3} = \\frac{80}{3} = \\boxed{26.67}$.\nSince we know the length of $\\overline{AD}$ is $\\frac{5x}{3}$ and $x = 16$, we can find the length of $\\overline{AD}$ by substituting this value into the equation $\\frac{5x}{3}$.\nNow, substitute the value of x into the equation for the length of $\\overline{AD}$: $\\frac{5(16)}{3}$.\nNow, evaluate the final expression: $\\frac{5(16)}{3} = \\boxed{\\frac{80}{3}}$.\nNow, simplify or approximate the fraction if necessary. In this case, the length of $\\overline{AD}$ is approximately $\\frac{80}{3} = 26.67$.\nNow, simplify or approximate the fraction if necessary. In this case, the length of $\\overline{AD}$ is approximately 26.67 units.\nSince $\\frac{80}{3}$ is approximately 26.67, the length of $\\overline{AD}$ is approximately 26.67 units.",
