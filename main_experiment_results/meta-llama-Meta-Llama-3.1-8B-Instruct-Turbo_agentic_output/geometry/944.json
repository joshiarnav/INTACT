    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, quadrilateral $EFCD$ is a trapezoid with half the altitude of the original trapezoid (the altitude of trapezoid $EFCD$ is $12/2 = 6$). The length of base $CD$ is still $20$, but now we have to find the length of base $EF$. Since $EF$ connects the midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, its length is also the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$. Thus, $EF$ has length $\\frac{8+20}{2} = 14$. Finally, we can find the area of the trapezoid with the formula $\\text{Area} = a \\left(\\frac{b_1+b_2}{2}\\right)$ where $a$ is the altitude and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases. The area of trapezoid $EFCD $ is $6 \\left(\\frac{14+20}{2}\\right)=6 \\cdot 17 = \\boxed{102}$ square units.",

    "model_solution": "To solve the problem, we need to find the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$. \n\nStep 1: Find the length of $EF$. Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of sides $AD$ and $BC$, we can use the midpoint theorem, which states that the segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half as long.\nStep 2: Find the length of $EF$. Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of sides $AD$ and $BC$, we can use the midpoint theorem, which states that the segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half as long. In this case, $EF$ is parallel to both $AB$ and $CD$, and since it is half as long as $AB$ and $BC$ are half the average of $AB$ and $CD$ ($8$ and $20$), $EF$ will be half of $\\frac{(8 + 20)}{2} = 14$ units, so the length of $EF$ is $14/2 = 7$ units.\n\nHowever, the step 2 description is misleading as it is actually based on the incorrect assumption that the segment $EF$ is parallel to the sides $AB$ and $CD$, which is not the case, as $EF$ is parallel to the sides $AD$ and $BC$. To calculate the length of $EF$ we need to calculate the average of the two parallel sides of the trapezoid $AB$ and $CD$.\nStep 3: Find the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$. Since the length of $EF$ is 7 units, and the altitude of the trapezoid is 12 units (which also serves as the altitude for the smaller trapezoid $ABEF$ and the larger trapezoid $EFCD$), we can find the area of $EFCD$ by first finding the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ and then subtracting the area of trapezoid $ABEF$. The area of a trapezoid is given by $\\frac{1}{2}h(a+b)$, where $h$ is the altitude, and $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the two parallel sides. Using the given values, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(12)(8+20) = 228$. Then, we can find the area of trapezoid $ABEF$. The average length of the two parallel sides of the smaller trapezoid is the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $EF$, which is $\\frac{8 + 7}{2} = 7\nStep 4: Find the area of trapezoid $ABEF$. The average length of the two parallel sides of the smaller trapezoid is $7.5$, and the altitude is $12$ units. The area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $228$ units$^2$, and since $EF$ is parallel to $AD$ and $BC$, the altitude of $ABEF$ is half the altitude of $ABCD$. The area of trapezoid $ABEF$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(6)(7.5+8) = 61.25$. The area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ minus the area of trapezoid $ABEF$, so the area of $EFCD$ is $228 - 61.25 = 166.75$ units$^2$.\nStep 5: Find the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$. Subtract the area of trapezoid $ABEF$ from the area of trapezoid $ABCD$, which gives us $228 - 61.25 = 166.75$ units$^2$.\nStep 6: Round the area of $EFCD$ to the nearest whole number, since we cannot have a fraction of a square unit in this context, which gives us $166.75 \\approx 167$ units$^2$.\nStep 7: The area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ is $166.75$ units$^2$.\nStep 8: Since the problem asks for the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ in square units, we can conclude our solution here.\nStep 9: The final area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ is already calculated as 166.75 units^2, so we can conclude our solution here.\nStep 10: Since the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ has already been calculated as 166.75 units^2, we can conclude that the final answer is indeed 166.75 units^2.",
