    "problem": "The corner of a unit cube is chopped off such that the cut runs through the three vertices adjacent to the vertex of the chosen corner.  What is the height of the remaining cube when the freshly-cut face is placed on a table?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The major diagonal has a length of $\\sqrt{3}$.  The volume of the pyramid is $1/6$, and so its height $h$ satisfies $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot h\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(\\sqrt{2})^2=1/6$ since  the freshly cut face is an equilateral triangle of side length $\\sqrt{2}$.  Thus $h=\\sqrt{3}/3$, and the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve the problem, we first need to understand the geometry of the situation. \n\nStep 1: Visualize the unit cube and the corner that is chopped off. The cut creates a triangular face with three edges that were originally part of the cube's corners. This triangular face will be the base of the remaining cube when it is placed on a table.\nStep 2: \nTo find the height of the remaining cube, we need to determine the distance from the apex of the cut off corner to the base (the freshly-cut face). This will form a right-angled triangle. The sides of this triangle are related to the edges of the original cube. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the height of the remaining cube to the lengths of the edges of this triangle.\nStep 3: \nWe need to express the height of the remaining cube in terms of the lengths of the sides of the original cube. Let's denote the height of the remaining cube as 'h' and the lengths of the sides of the cube as 's'. Since the triangular face is an equilateral triangle, its sides are equal to 's'. The distance from the apex to the center of the triangular face is 's/sqrt(3)', and using the Pythagorean theorem, we can write: h^2 + (s/sqrt(3))^2 = s^2.\nStep 4: Solve the equation for 'h' to find the height of the remaining cube. \n\n\\[\nh^2 = s^2 - \\frac{s^2}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nh^2 = \\frac{2s^2}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nh = \\frac{s\\sqrt{6}}{3}\n\\]\nStep 5: \nGiven that the original cube is a unit cube (i.e., s = 1), we can substitute this value into the expression for 'h' to find the height of the remaining cube. This will give us the final answer in terms of the unit of the cube's side.\nStep 6:\nSubstitute s = 1 into the expression for 'h' to find the height of the remaining cube.\n\nh = \\frac{(1)\\sqrt{6}}{3}\nh = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\nStep 7 (Final Step): \nOur final answer is the height of the remaining cube, expressed in terms of the unit of the cube's side.\nStep 5: \nGiven that the original cube is a unit cube (i.e., s = 1), we can substitute this value into the expression for 'h' to find the height of the remaining cube.\nStep 6: \nSubstitute s = 1 into the expression for 'h' to find the height of the remaining cube.\n\nh = \\frac{(1)\\sqrt{6}}{3}\nh = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\nStep 5:\nGiven that the original cube is a unit cube (i.e., s = 1), we can substitute this value into the expression for 'h' to find the height of the remaining cube.",
