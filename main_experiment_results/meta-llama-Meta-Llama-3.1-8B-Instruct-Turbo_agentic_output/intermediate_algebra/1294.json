    "solution": "From the given information we know that $|a| |b| = |ab| = 2\\sqrt{26}$. We can also write $|ab| = |t-2i| = \\sqrt{t^2 + 4}$. Setting these equal, we have $$\\sqrt{t^2 + 4} = 2\\sqrt{26} \\Rightarrow\nt^2 + 4 = 104.$$The positive answer is $t = \\boxed{10}$.",

So, $|ab| = |a|\\cdot |b|$.\nStep 2: Use the given information to find the magnitude of $ab$. $|ab| = |a| \\cdot |b| = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{26} = 2\\sqrt{26}$. This also equals $|t-2i| = \\sqrt{t^2 + 4}$. Setting these equal to each other gives $\\sqrt{t^2 + 4} = 2\\sqrt{26}$.\nStep 3: Square both sides of the equation $\\sqrt{t^2 + 4} = 2\\sqrt{26}$ to eliminate the square root. This gives $t^2 + 4 = 104$, and then subtract 4 from both sides to get $t^2 = 100$.\nStep 4: Take the square root of both sides of the equation $t^2 = 100$ to solve for $t$. This gives $t = \\pm\\sqrt{100} = \\pm10$. Since the problem asks for the positive value of $t$, we choose $t = 10$.\nStep 5: As the positive value of $t$ is required, the solution is confirmed to be $t = 10$.\nStep 6: Confirm that the solution satisfies the original equation, $ab = t-2i$.
