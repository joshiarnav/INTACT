    "solution": "We can attempt to deconstruct the summand by applying supposing that it breaks down like a partial fraction:\n\\[\\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})} = \\frac{A}{3^k - 2^k} + \\frac{B}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}}.\\]Then\n\\[6^k = A (3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}) + B (3^k - 2^k),\\]which expands as\n\\[6^k = (3A + B) 3^k - (2A + B) 2^k.\\]It makes sense to make both $(3A + B) 3^k$ and $(2A + B) 2^k$ multiples of $6^k$ that differ by $6^k.$  To this end, set $(3A + B) 3^k = (n + 1) 6^k$ and $(2A + B) 2^k = n6^k.$  Then $3A + B = (n + 1) 2^k$ and $2A + B = n3^k$.  Subtracting these equations, we get $A = (n + 1) 2^k - n3^k.$  It follows that $B = 3n3^k - 2(n + 1) 2^k,$ which gives us\n\\[\\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})} = \\frac{(n + 1) 2^k - n3^k}{3^k - 2^k} + \\frac{3n3^k - 2(n + 1) 2^k}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}}.\\]We can try setting $n$ to different values, to see what we get.  If we set $n = 0,$ then we get\n\\[\\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})} = \\frac{2^k}{3^k - 2^k} - \\frac{2^{k + 1}}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}},\\]which makes the sum telescope.\n\nJust to make sure the sum converges, we compute the $n$th partial sum:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{k = 1}^n \\frac{6^k}{(3^k - 2^k)(3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1})} &= \\sum_{k = 1}^n \\left( \\frac{2^k}{3^k - 2^k} - \\frac{2^{k + 1}}{3^{k + 1} - 2^{k + 1}} \\right) \\\\\n&= 2 - \\frac{2^{n + 1}}{3^{n + 1} - 2^{n + 1}} \\\\\n&= 2 - \\frac{1}{(\\frac{3}{2})^{n + 1} - 1}.\n\\end{align*}As $n$ becomes very large, $\\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^{n + 1}$ also becomes very large.  Thus, the infinite sum is $\\boxed{2}.$",
