    "solution": "Suppose the function $f(x) = 0$ has only one distinct root.  If $x_1$ is a root of $f(f(x)) = 0,$ then we must have $f(x_1) = r_1.$  But the equation $f(x) = r_1$ has at most two roots.  Therefore, the equation $f(x) = 0$ must have two distinct roots.  Let them be $r_1$ and $r_2.$\n\nSince $f(f(x)) = 0$ has three distinct roots, one of the equations $f(x) = r_1$ or $f(x) = r_2$ has one distinct root.  Without loss generality, assume that $f(x) = r_1$ has one distinct root.  Then $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c = r_1$ has one root.  This means\n\\[x^2 + 6x + c - r_1\\]must be equal to $(x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9 = 0,$ so $c - r_1 = 9.$  Hence, $r_1 = c - 9.$\n\nSince $r_1$ is a root of $f(x) = 0,$\n\\[(c - 9)^2 + 6(c - 9) + c = 0.\\]Expanding, we get $c^2 - 11c + 27 = 0,$ so\n\\[c = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{2}.\\]If $c = \\frac{11 - \\sqrt{13}}{2},$ then $r_1 = c - 9 = -\\frac{7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}$ and $r_2 = -6 - r_1 = \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{13}}{2},$ so\n\\[f(x) = x^2 + 6x + \\frac{11 - \\sqrt{13}}{2} = \\left( x + \\frac{7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\right) \\left( x + \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\right) = (x + 3)^2 - \\frac{7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}.\\]The equation $f(x) = r_1$ has a double root of $x = -3,$ and the equation $f(x) = r_2$ has two roots, so $f(f(x)) = 0$ has exactly three roots.\n\nIf $c = \\frac{11 + \\sqrt{13}}{2},$ then $r_1 = c - 9 = \\frac{-7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}$ and $r_2 = -6 - r_1 = -\\frac{5 + \\sqrt{13}}{2},$ and\n\\[f(x) = x^2 + 6x + \\frac{11 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} = \\left( x + \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\right) \\left( x + \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\right) = (x + 3)^2 + \\frac{-7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}.\\]The equation $f(x) = r_1$ has a double root of $x = -3,$ but the equation $f(x) = r_2$ has no real roots, so $f(f(x)) = 0$ has exactly one root.\n\nTherefore, $c = \\boxed{\\frac{11 - \\sqrt{13}}{2}}.$",
