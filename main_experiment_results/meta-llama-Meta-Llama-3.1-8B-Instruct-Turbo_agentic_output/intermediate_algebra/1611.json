    "solution": "The condition $a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n|$ implies that $a_n$ and $a_{n+3}$ have the same parity for all $n\\geq 1$. Because $a_{2006}$ is odd, $a_2$ is also odd.  Because $a_{2006}=1$ and $a_n$ is a multiple of $\\gcd(a_1,a_2)$ for all $n$, it follows that $1=\\gcd(a_1,a_2)=\\gcd(3^3\\cdot 37,a_2)$. There are 499 odd integers in the interval $[1,998]$, of which 166 are multiples of 3, 13 are multiples of 37, and 4 are multiples of $3\\cdot 37=111$. By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the number of possible values of $a_2$ cannot exceed $499-166-13+4=\\boxed{324}$.\n\nTo see that there are actually 324 possibilities, note that for $n\\geq 3$, $a_n<\\max(a_{n-2},a_{n-1})$ whenever $a_{n-2}$ and $a_{n-1}$ are both positive.  Thus $a_N=0$ for some $N\\leq 1999$. If $\\gcd(a_1,a_2)=1$, then $a_{N-2}=a_{N-1}=1$, and for $n>N$ the sequence cycles through the values 1, 1, 0.  If in addition $a_2$ is odd, then $a_{3k+2}$ is odd for $k\\geq 1$, so $a_{2006}=1$.",

Given the recursive rule $a_{n+2} = |a_{n+1} - a_n|$, we want to determine how $a_2$ affects $a_{2006}$.\nSince $a_{2006} = 1$, and the rule is $a_{n+2} = |a_{n+1} - a_n|$, we see that $a_{2005}$ and $a_{2004}$ must be consecutive numbers whose difference is 1. This means that $a_{2005} = a_{2004} + 1$, so $|a_{2004} - a_{2005}| = 1$. This pattern continues until we reach $a_3$ and $a_2$.\nTo continue solving the problem, we note that if $a_3$ and $a_2$ are consecutive numbers, then $a_{2006} = 1$ implies $a_2 - a_3 = 1$ or $a_3 - a_2 = 1$. This means $a_2$ and $a_3$ must be of the form $a_2 = k$ and $a_3 = k + 1$ or $a_2 = k + 1$ and $a_3 = k$. The next step is to consider the possible values of $a_3$ and $a_2$ based on these two cases and the given condition that $a_2 < 999$.\nTo continue solving the problem, we note that if $a_2 = k$ and $a_3 = k + 1$, then $a_4 = |(k + 1) - k| = 1$. This means that in this case, $a_4, a_5, \\ldots, a_{2006}$ will all be 1, and this will also be true if $a_2 = k + 1$ and $a_3 = k$ (the sequence will be $k, k+1, 1, 1, \\ldots, 1$).\nSince $a_4, a_5, \\ldots, a_{2006}$ will all be 1 in both cases, $a_2$ can be any integer from 1 to 998, and we also have to consider the case when $a_2 = 999$, which is not possible as per the given condition $a_2 < 999$.\nSince $a_2$ can be any integer from 1 to 998, we need to find the number of integers in this range.\nSince $a_2$ can be any integer from 1 to 998, we need to find the number of integers in this range. To do this, we can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1, since the range is inclusive. Therefore, the number of possibilities for $a_2$ is $998 - 1 + 1$.\nThe next step is to calculate the number of possibilities for $a_2$, which is $998 - 1 + 1$.\nThe final step is to calculate the number of possibilities for $a_2$, which is $998 - 1 + 1 = \\boxed{998}$.\nThe next step is to calculate the number of possibilities for $a_2$, which is $998 - 1 + 1$.",
