    "problem": "If $a$ is a nonzero integer and $b$ is a positive number such that $ab^2=\\log_{10} b$, what is the median of the set $\\{0, 1, a, b,\n1/b\\}$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Because $b<10^b$ for all $b>0$, it follows that $\\log_{10}b<b$.  If $b\\geq 1$, then $0<\\left(\\log_{10}b\\right)/b^2<1$, so $a$ cannot be an integer. Therefore $0<b<1$, so $\\log_{10}b<0$ and $a =\n\\left(\\log_{10}b\\right)/b^2<0$.  Thus $a<0<b<1<1/b$, and the median of the set is $\\boxed{b}$.\n\nNote that the conditions of the problem can be met with $b = 0.1$ and $a = -100$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the median of the set $\\{0, 1, a, b, 1/b\\}$, we need to first arrange the elements in the set in order from smallest to largest. \n\nStep 1: Determine the order of $0$ and $1$ in the set. $0$ is smaller than $1$, so the set remains as is: $\\{0, 1, a, b, 1/b\\}$.\nStep 2: Determine the order of $b$ and $1/b$ in the set. Since $b$ is positive, $1/b$ is also positive. Also, since $b$ is not equal to 1, $1/b$ is not equal to 1, and since $b$ is positive, $1/b$ is less than $b$. Therefore, we have the partial set $\\{0, 1, a, b, 1/b\\}$ with $0$ and $1$ in their correct order and $1/b < b$.\nStep 3: Determine the order of $a$ in the set. Since $ab^2 = \\log_{10} b$, $ab^2$ must be positive because $\\log_{10} b$ is positive for any positive $b$. Also, $b^2$ is always positive. Thus, $a$ must be positive. Since $a$ is positive and $1/b < b$, $a$ must be greater than or equal to $b$, so the set is in order: $\\{0, 1, 1/b, b, a\\}$.\nStep 4: The median of the set $\\{0, 1, 1/b, b, a\\}$ is the middle element in the ordered set. Since there are five elements, the median is the third element, which is $1/b$.\nStep 5: We are given that $b$ is a positive number and $ab^2 = \\log_{10} b$. However, we cannot conclude that $b > 1$ or $b < 1$ from this equation. This is because the logarithm function can have any positive value for a positive base. But, since $\\log_{10} b$ is positive, we cannot guarantee that $b > 1$. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that $1/b < b$. This means that $a$ could be less than or equal to $b$ or greater than $b$. Since the set is in order, there are two possible sets: $\\{0, 1, 1/b, b, a\\}$ and $\\{0, 1, 1/b, a, b\\}$.\nStep 6: To find the median of the two possible sets, we need to consider both cases. However, since the question does not specify which case is correct, we cannot determine a single value for the median. However, given that the original answer $1/b$ was based on the assumption that $1/b < b$, we can conclude that $1/b$ is a valid median only if this assumption holds.\nStep 7: We need to check if the assumption $1/b < b$ holds true. Given that $ab^2=\\log_{10} b$, we can rearrange the equation to $b^2=\\frac{\\log_{10} b}{a}$. Since $\\log_{10} b$ is positive, $b^2$ is positive and thus $b > 0$. We also know that $a$ is positive. Since $b^2 > 0$, we have $\\frac{\\log_{10} b}{a} > 0$ and thus $\\log_{10} b > 0$. Since $b$ is positive, $\\log_{10} b$ is positive when $b > 1$. Therefore, if $b > 1$, then $1/b < b$ and the median is $1/b$.\nStep 8: Since we have shown that if $b > 1$ then the median is $1/b$, we need to check if $b > 1$ is the only possibility. However, the original equation $ab^2 = \\log_{10} b$ also satisfies $b = 1$ because $\\log_{10} 1 = 0$ which means $0 = a\\cdot 1^2$ and since we are given that $a$ is nonzero, then $b = 1$ is not possible, so $b > 1$.\nStep 9: \nSince the equation $ab^2 = \\log_{10} b$ does not satisfy $b = 1$ due to the nonzero value of $a$, and we have shown that if $b > 1$ then the median is $1/b$, we can conclude that the median of the set $\\{0, 1, a, b, 1/b\\}$ is $1/b$.\nStep 10: \nSince we have shown that the median of the set $\\{0, 1, a, b, 1/b\\}$ is $1/b$ when $b > 1$, we can conclude that the median of the set $\\{0, 1, a, b, 1/b\\}$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{b}}$.",
