    "solution": "Write the equation of the original parabola as $y = a(x - h)^2 + k,$ where $a \\neq 0.$  Then the equation of the reflected parabola is\n\\[y = -a(x - h)^2 - k.\\]When the parabolas are translated horizontally by 5 units, in opposite directions, their equations become\n\\[y = a(x - h \\pm 5)^2 + k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -a(x - h \\mp 5)^2 - k.\\]The sum of these expressions is\n\\[\\pm 20ax \\mp 20ah = \\pm 20a (x - h),\\]which is the equation of a non-horizontal line.
