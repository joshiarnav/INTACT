(Equation 1)\n-2ab\\sqrt3 = -20\\sqrt3  ... (Equation 2)\n\nFrom Equation 2, we can solve for the ratio of a and b:\n\n-2ab = -20\nab = 10\n\nNow we have the ratio of a and b.\nNow, we'll solve for the individual values of a and b by substituting ab = 10 into Equation 1:\n\na^2 + 3b^2 = 37\nSince ab = 10, we can express b as 10/a. Substituting this into Equation 1, we get:\na^2 + (300/a^2) = 37\nMultiplying through by a^2, we get:\na^4 + 300 = 37a^2\nRearranging, we get:\na^4 - 37a^2 + 300 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in a^2. Let's denote a^2 as u. Then we have:\n\nu^2 - 37u + 300 = 0\n\nNow we can solve for u.\nTo solve for u, we can use the quadratic formula: \n\nu = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -37, and c = 300. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nu = \\frac{37 \\pm \\sqrt{(-37)^2-4(1)(300)}}{2(1)}\nu = \\frac{37 \\pm \\sqrt{1369-1200}}{2}\nu = \\frac{37 \\pm \\sqrt{169}}{2}\nu = \\frac{37 \\pm 13}{2}\n\nThis gives us two possible values for u: u = \\frac{37 + 13}{2} and u = \\frac{37 - 13}{2}. We'll consider these two cases separately.\nNow, we'll consider the two cases for u separately:\nCase 1: u = \\frac{37 + 13}{2} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25\nCase 2: u = \\frac{37 - 13}{2} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n\nSince u represents a^2, we have two possible values for a: a = \\sqrt{25} = 5 or a = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}.\nNow, we'll consider the two cases for a separately. Since we assumed x = a - b\\sqrt3, we have:\n\nCase 1: a = 5\nSubstituting a = 5 into ab = 10, we get b = 2. Therefore, x = 5 - 2\\sqrt3.\n\nCase 2: a = 2\\sqrt3\nSubstituting a = 2\\sqrt3 into ab = 10, we get b = 5/\\sqrt3 = 5\\sqrt3/3. However, since the expression x^2 = a^2 - 2ab\\sqrt3 + 3b^2 must be non-negative, the value of b = 5\\sqrt3/3 makes the term - 2ab\\sqrt3 positive, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, this solution is extraneous and we only consider the first case.\nSince we've found that x = 5 - 2\\sqrt3 is a valid solution, we can now simplify the original expression \\sqrt{37-20\\sqrt3} by substituting the value of x.\n\nx = \\sqrt{37-20\\sqrt3}\n= \\boxed{5 - 2\\sqrt3}\nNow that we've found a valid solution, we need to verify that this solution satisfies the original equation. Since we have x = 5 - 2\\sqrt3, we can square both sides to get:\n\nx^2 = (5 - 2\\sqrt3)^2\nExpanding the squared expression, we get:\n\nx^2 = 25 - 20\\sqrt3 + 12\nx^2 = 37 - 20\\sqrt3\n\nSince x^2 = 37 - 20\\sqrt3 matches the original expression under the square root, we have verified that the solution x = 5 - 2\\sqrt3 is indeed correct.\nNow that we've found a valid solution, we need to verify that this solution satisfies the original equation. Since we have x = 5 - 2\u221a3, we can square both sides to get:\n\nx^2 = (5 - 2\u221a3)^2\nExpanding the squared expression, we get:\n\nx^2 = 25 - 20\u221a3 + 12\nx^2 = 37 - 20\u221a3\n\nSince x^2 = 37 - 20\u221a3 matches the original expression under the square root, we have verified that the solution x = 5 - 2\u221a3 is indeed correct.",
