    "solution": "An example of a quadratic function with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ is $(x-2)(x-4)$. However, when $x=3$, this function takes the value $-1$. However, multiplying the entire quadratic by $-6$ does not change the location of the zeroes, and does give us the desired value at $x=3$.\n\nThus, $-6(x-2)(x-4)$ has all the desired properties. The expanded form of this expression is $\\boxed{-6x^2+36x-48}$.\n\nNote that this is the only such quadratic. Any quadratic must factor as $a(x-r)(x-s)$, where its zeroes are $r$ and $s$; thus a quadratic with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ must be of the form $a(x-2)(x-4)$, and the coefficient $a=-6$ is forced by the value at $x=3$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Since we are given two zeroes, we can write the quadratic function in factored form as $f(x) = a(x-2)(x-4)$, where $a$ is a constant to be determined.\nStep 2:  To find the value of $a$, we can substitute $x = 3$ and $f(x) = 6$ into the equation, which gives us $6 = a(3-2)(3-4)$. Solving this equation will give us the value of $a$.\nStep 3: Simplifying the equation from Step 2, we get $6 = a(1)(-1)$. This simplifies to $6 = -a$, and solving for $a$ gives us $a = -6$.\nStep 4:  Now that we have found the value of $a$, we can substitute it back into the equation in factored form to obtain $f(x) = -6(x-2)(x-4)$. To find the expanded form, we can distribute the $-6$ across the terms in the parentheses.\nStep 5: \nNow, we distribute the $-6$ across the terms in the parentheses to get $f(x) = -6(x-2)(x-4) = -6(x^2 - 4x - 2x + 8) = -6(x^2 - 6x + 8)$.
