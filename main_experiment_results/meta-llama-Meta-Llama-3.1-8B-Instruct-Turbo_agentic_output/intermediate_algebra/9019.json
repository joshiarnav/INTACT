We can then simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $2$. This gives $\\dfrac{2836 \\div 2}{34030 \\div 2} = \\dfrac{1418}{17015}$. We can then simplify further by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $1$. This gives $\\dfrac{1418}{17015}$. To add the two fractions, we can rewrite $\\dfrac{309440}{277184}$ as $\\dfrac{309440 \\div 8}{277184 \\div 8} = \\dfrac{38780}{34480}$, then as $\\dfrac{38780 \\div 4}{34480 \\div 4} = \\dfrac{9695}{8612}$. We can then simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is",
