    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We let our integer be $n$.  the first sentence tells us that  \\[n\\equiv 7\\pmod {15}.\\] Since 3 and 5 are both factors of 15 we deduce \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv2\\pmod5.\n\\end{align*} Therefore the remainders in question are 1 and 2, and their sum is $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let the integer be represented as 'x'. \n\nStep 1: Since x divided by 15 leaves a remainder of 7, it can be expressed as:\nx = 15k + 7, where k is an integer (k \u2265 0).\nStep 2: Express x in terms of 3 and 5. Factor 15 into 3 * 5. Since x = 15k + 7, we can rewrite it as x = (3 * 5)k + 7. Rewrite this expression as x = 3(5k) + 7.\n\nNext step will involve division by 5.  To find the remainder when x is divided by 3, the expression 3(5k) can be ignored since any number multiplied by 3 and then divided by 3 will be an integer.\nStep 3: To find the remainder when x is divided by 5, consider the integer part of x when divided by 5, which is 5k. This is always divisible by 5 with a remainder of 0.\n\nNow, when we divide x = 3(5k) + 7 by 5, we only need to consider the remainder from the +7. When 7 is divided by 5, the remainder is 2. \n\nSo, the remainder when x is divided by 5 is 2.\n\nTo find the remainder when x is divided by 3, x = 3(5k) + 7 can be divided by 3, giving a remainder of 1 (since 7 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1).\n\nTherefore, the sum of the remainders when x is divided by 3 and by 5 is 1 + 2 = 3.\nSince the problem has been completely solved, the correct answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
