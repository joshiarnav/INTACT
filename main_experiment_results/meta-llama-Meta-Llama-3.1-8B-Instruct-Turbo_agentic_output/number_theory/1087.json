    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block. We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$. Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To find the $100$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{3}{26}$ is expressed as a decimal, we first need to convert $\\frac{3}{26}$ into a decimal using long division. Performing long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26} = 0.1\\overline{153846}$.\nSince $\\frac{3}{26}$ has a repeating decimal $153846$, we need to find the position of the $100$th digit within this repeating block. To do this, we divide $100$ by $6$ (the length of the repeating block), which gives a quotient of $16$ and a remainder of $4$. This means that the $100$th digit is the $4$th digit in the repeating block, which is $3$.\nSince the $100$th digit corresponds to the $4$th digit in the repeating block, we conclude that the $100$th digit after the decimal point in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{3}{26}$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
