    "problem": "What is the largest number, with its digits all different, whose digits add up to 16?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "For a number to be as large as possible, we want as many places (digits) as possible. To allow for as many digits as possible, we want the digits to be small so that there will be more digits that add up to $16$. We start with the smallest number, $0$ and keep adding the next number. $0+1+2+3+4=10$. However, we cannot add $5$, because then we are left with $16-10-5=1$, and we already have the number $1$. Therefore, the next number to be added would be $16-10=6$.\nNow, we have the numbers $0,1,2,3,4,6$ to form a number. We want the larger places to have larger numbers. Therefore, we order the numbers in decreasing order to form the number $\\boxed{643210}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, the first step is to find the combination of digits that add up to 16. The largest possible digits should be used first. Since the digits must be different and we are looking for the largest number, we can start with the largest single-digit number, which is 9.\nThe next step is to determine how many times 9 can be used in the combination of digits that add up to 16. Since 9 is a large digit and we want the largest possible number, we should maximize the number of 9s. If we use one 9, we have 7 remaining to add up. The next largest digit is 7, but since we need to use different digits, we should consider using the next largest digit, 6, instead, which leaves 1 remaining.\nThe next step is to find the largest digits that add up to the remaining amount, which is 1. Since 1 is a single-digit number, we can directly include it in our combination. To maximize the number of 9s and create the largest possible number, we can use two 9s and one 7, and then add the 6 and 1 to complete the combination.\nThe next step is to order the selected digits in descending order to create the largest possible number.\nThe final step is to order the selected digits in descending order to create the largest possible number. The selected digits are 9, 9, 7, 6, and 1. In descending order, they become 97 911.\nThe next step is to order the selected digits in descending order to create the largest possible number. The selected digits are 9, 9, 7, 6, and 1. In descending order, they become 9 9 7 6 1.\nThe next step is to order the selected digits in descending order to create the largest possible number. The selected digits are 9, 9, 7, 6, and 1. In descending order, they become 99761.\nThe selected digits are 9, 9, 7, 6, and 1. In descending order, they become 99761.\nThe selected digits are 9, 9, 7, 6, and 1. In descending order, they become 99761.",
