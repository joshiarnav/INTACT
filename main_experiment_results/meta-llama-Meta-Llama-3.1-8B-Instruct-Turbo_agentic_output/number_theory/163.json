    "problem": "What is the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 which has two even and two odd digits?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$.",

    "model_solution": "First step: The smallest four-digit number is 1000. However, to find the smallest four-digit number with two even and two odd digits, let's start with a base number where we have two odd and two even digits, such as 1089.\nNext step: Check if 1089 is divisible by 9 (which it is) and see if it's the smallest number possible. If it's not, we'll have to adjust the digits slightly to make it smaller while keeping two even and two odd digits.\nTo find the smallest possible number, we'll try to make the thousands digit as small as possible while maintaining two even and two odd digits. Since 1089 is divisible by 9 and has two even and two odd digits, we can consider the next smallest number by decreasing the tens digit. However, we should ensure the number remains divisible by 9.\nTo find the next possible number, we can decrease the tens digit from 0 to an even number (since 1089 has two even digits, we cannot decrease two odd digits as it would violate the condition of two even and two odd digits). The closest even number less than 0 is 8, but since we are changing the tens digit from 0, we have 1089 -> 1088, however, 1088 is not divisible by 9. \n\nNext, let's try 1079, which equals 1079 = 1079 = (1*100 + 0*10 + 7*1) + (9*1) = 107 + 9 = 116. Since 116 is divisible by 9, 1079 is indeed divisible by 9.\nSince 1079 is divisible by 9 and has two even (0) and two odd digits (1, 7 and 9), and we are looking for the smallest four-digit number with two even and two odd digits, we can consider the next smallest number by decreasing the thousands digit. \n\nSince we must maintain two even and two odd digits, the next smallest thousands digit is 1. Decreasing the thousands digit from 1 to a smaller number would result in a three-digit number, which violates the condition of a four-digit number. However, we can decrease the thousands digit from 1 to another odd number to still have two odd and two even digits. The next smallest odd digit is 0 is not possible (since we are decreasing from 1), and the next smallest is 0 is not valid for decreasing from 1 and maintaining both even and odd, however, 0 is the smallest odd number and decreasing from 1 by 2 is valid, and 0 + 2 = 2, and decreasing the thousands digit from 1 to 0 is not valid, since we could decrease to 0 + 2 and 1 - 2 = -1 and a negative number is not valid for\nTo generate the next possible number with two even and two odd digits, we'll try to maintain the thousands digit at 1, and adjust the other digits. Since we cannot decrease the thousands digit from 1 to a smaller number without violating the four-digit condition, we'll try to decrease the thousands digit from 1 to another odd number while keeping two even and two odd digits. If we decrease the thousands digit from 1 by 2 (which is 2 - 2 = 0 is not valid since we are decreasing from 1), we can then try 1 - 1 = 0 is not valid, however, 1 - 1 + 3 = 3 is not valid, however, 1 - 1 + 1 = 1. However, we can try decreasing 1 by 2 = -1 which is not valid, however, we can try decreasing 1 by 1 which is 0 which is not valid. However, decreasing 1 by 3 is 1 - 3 = -2 which is not valid. However, the next smallest odd digit is 3. However, we can also try decreasing the thousands digit from 1 by 1 which is 0\nTo generate the next possible number with two even and two odd digits, we'll try to maintain the thousands digit at 1, and adjust the other digits. We can try 1079 with the thousands digit 1 and then the hundreds digit 0, decreasing the hundreds digit from 7 to 5 (an odd digit), while keeping the tens digit 0 (an even digit) and the ones digit 9 (an odd digit). Thus, the next possible number is 1059.\nLet's try to maintain the thousands digit at 1 and adjust the other digits. We can try 1079 with the thousands digit 1 and then the hundreds digit 0, decreasing the hundreds digit from 7 to 5 (an odd digit), while keeping the tens digit 0 (an even digit) and the ones digit 9 (an odd digit).

However, 1059 is also divisible by 9.\nTo generate the next possible number with two even and two odd digits, we'll try to maintain the thousands digit at 1, and adjust the other digits. We can try 1059 with the thousands digit 1, hundreds digit 0, decreasing the hundreds digit from 5 to 3 (an odd digit), while keeping the tens digit 0 (an even digit) and the ones digit 9 (an odd digit).
