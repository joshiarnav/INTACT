    "solution": "We have $$2^{2005}\\times5^{2007}\\times3=(2\\times5)^{2005}\\times5^2\\times3=75\\times10^{2005},$$ so the sum of the digits is $7+5=\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "First, we simplify the expression by combining the powers of 2 and 5. Since $2^a \\times 5^b = 10^{a+b}$ when a and b are both positive integers, we have:\n\n$2^{2005} \\times 5^{2007} \\times 3 = (2 \\times 5)^{2005} \\times 5^2 \\times 3 = 10^{2005} \\times 75$\nThe next step is to express $10^{2005}$ in its decimal form and calculate the sum of the digits of the resulting expression. Since $10^{2005}$ is a 1 followed by 2005 zeros, multiplying it by 75 results in a number with 2005 zeros and a decimal part of 75. Therefore, the sum of the digits is 7 + 5 = 12.\nThe final step is to identify that the sum of the digits of the decimal representation of $2^{2005} \\times 5^{2007} \\times 3$ is 12.\nSince $10^{2005}$ is a 1 followed by 2005 zeros, multiplying it by 75 results in a number with 2005 zeros and a decimal part of 75.
