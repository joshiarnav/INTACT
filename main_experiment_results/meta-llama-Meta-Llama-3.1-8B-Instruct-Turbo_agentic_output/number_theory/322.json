    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  We are looking for the largest three-digit number, so let's start by considering the hundreds digit. Since we want the largest possible number, let's begin with 9 as the hundreds digit.\n\nNow, we need to think about the tens and units digits, which should be distinct and non-zero.\nStep 2:  To ensure that the three-digit number is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we should consider the units digit next. Since the number must be divisible by the units digit, the units digit can be 1, 3, 7, or 9 (as these are the only single-digit numbers that can divide a three-digit number and are also non-zero and distinct). We should start by evaluating the largest possible unit digit, which is 9, and check if a suitable tens digit can be found.\nStep 3:  If the units digit is 9, the number must be divisible by 9. For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by 9. Since the hundreds digit is 9, and we're trying to find the largest possible number, let's try the next largest tens digit, which is 8. The sum of the digits would be 9 + 8 + 9 = 26, which is not divisible by 9. However, if we consider the tens digit as 7, the sum of the digits would be 9 + 7 + 9 = 25, which is also not divisible by 9. If we try the tens digit as 6, the sum of the digits would be 9 + 6 + 9 = 24, which is also not divisible by 9. If we try the tens digit as 5, the sum of the digits would be 9 + 5 + 9 = 23, which is also not divisible by 9. If we try the tens digit as 4, the sum of the digits would be 9 + 4 + 9 = 22,\nStep 4: \nIf we try the tens digit as 3, the sum of the digits would be 9 + 3 + 9 = 21, which is not divisible by 9. If we try the tens digit as 2, the sum of the digits would be 9 + 2 + 9 = 20, which is also not divisible by 9. If we try the tens digit as 1, the sum of the digits would be 9 + 1 + 9 = 19, which is also not divisible by 9. Therefore, a three-digit number with 9 as the hundreds digit and 9 as the units digit cannot be found. Now let's try the next largest possible unit digit, which is 7. For a number to be divisible by 7, the number formed by its last three digits must be divisible by 7. If the units digit is 7, let's try to find a suitable tens digit.\nStep 4: \nIf the units digit is 7, the number formed by its last three digits (987) must be divisible by 7. However, 987 is not divisible by 7. We should try the next largest possible unit digit, which is 3, or continue evaluating the conditions for the tens digit with the units digit being 7.\nStep 5: \nNow let's try the next largest possible unit digit, which is 3 or 7, but since 7 was already evaluated, let's start with the next largest. If the units digit is 3, we need to find a suitable tens digit. We can check if the number formed by its last three digits (93x) is divisible by 3, where x is the tens digit. Since the number must be divisible by both 9 and 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by both 9 and 3. The sum of the digits would be 9 + 3 + x, which simplifies to 12 + x. For the sum to be divisible by both 9 and 3, x must be 6, as 18 is divisible by both 9 and 3. Therefore, the largest three-digit number that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits is 936.\nStep 6: \nSince we have found a suitable number with 936, we should now check if there is a larger suitable number by considering other combinations of the hundreds digit and distinct non-zero digits. However, we have already considered 9 as the hundreds digit and 7 as the units digit, and we have also considered 9 as the hundreds digit and 3 as the units digit. Therefore, the next largest possible hundreds digit is 8, which we should evaluate next.\nStep 6: \nNow that we've considered 9 as the hundreds digit, let's move on to 8 as the hundreds digit. Since we want the largest possible number, we should start by considering the largest possible unit digit that is non-zero and distinct from the hundreds digit, which is 9. However, we've already tried 9 as the units digit with 8 as the hundreds digit. So, let's try the next largest unit digit, which is 7. For a number to be divisible by 7, the number formed by its last three digits (8x7) must be divisible by 7.\nStep 7: \nSince 987 is not divisible by 7, let's try the next largest possible unit digit that is non-zero and distinct from the hundreds digit, which is 3. However, we've already tried 3 as the units digit with 8 as the hundreds digit, and the tens digit would have to be 6 to satisfy the conditions, but we are trying to find a number larger than 936. Therefore, we should try other combinations of the hundreds digit, tens digit, and units digit.\nStep 8: \nNow that we've considered 9 and 8 as the hundreds digits, let's move on to 7 as the hundreds digit. Since we want the largest possible number, we should start by considering the largest possible unit digit that is non-zero and distinct from the hundreds digit, which is 9 or 8, but 9 has already been tried, so let's start with 8. However, we've already tried 8 as the units digit with 7 as the hundreds digit. So, let's try 9 as the units digit. For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by 9. If the hundreds digit is 7 and the units digit is 9, let's try to find a suitable tens digit.",
