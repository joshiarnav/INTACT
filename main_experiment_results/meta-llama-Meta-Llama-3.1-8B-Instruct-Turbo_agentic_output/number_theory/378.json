    "problem": "What is the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "$\\frac{n+18}{n}=1+\\frac{18}{n}$. Thus, $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer if and only if $n|18$. The positive factors of 18 are 1, 18, 2, 9, 3, and 6. Their sum is $\\boxed{39}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer, we first need to simplify the expression. \n\nWe start by expressing $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ as $\\frac{n}{n} + \\frac{18}{n}$, which simplifies to $1 + \\frac{18}{n}$.\nFor the expression $1 + \\frac{18}{n}$ to be an integer, $\\frac{18}{n}$ must be an integer. Therefore, we need to find the positive divisors of 18. The positive divisors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. These are the possible values of $n$.\nThe next step is to sum the possible values of $n$: $1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 18 = 39$.\nWe have found the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer. Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{39}$.",
