    "problem": "Let $g(n)$ be the product of the proper positive integer divisors of $n$. (Recall that a proper divisor of $n$ is a divisor other than $n$.) For how many values of $n$ does $n$ not divide $g(n)$, given that $2 \\le n \\le 50$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If $n$ is prime, then $g(n) = 1$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. The primes less than or equal to $50$ are $$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.$$There are $15$ of these primes. Also, if $n$ is the square of a prime, then $g(n) = \\sqrt{n}$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. By looking at the list of primes we already generated, we see that there are four perfect squares of primes less than $50$. If $n$ is any other composite integer, then it can be decomposed into the product of integers $a$ and $b$ with both integers greater than $1$. We have that $ab$ divides $g(n)$ (since $g(n)$ is the product of a collection of integers including $a$ and $b$). Since $ab=n$, this implies that $n$ divides $g(n)$. As a result, there are $15 + 4 = \\boxed{19}$ values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.",

    "model_solution": "First step: \nConsider the prime numbers in the range $2 \\le n \\le 50$, because a prime $p$ will not divide $g(p)$ since its only proper divisors are $1$ and $p$ itself. So $p$ will not be a divisor of $g(p)$ for prime $p$.\nSecond step:\nConsider the perfect squares of prime numbers in the range $2 \\le n \\le 50$, because they will also not divide $g(n)$ since their only proper divisors are $1$ and their square root. There are 5 prime numbers whose squares are in the given range: $2^2=4, 3^2=9, 5^2=25, 7^2=49$ and $11^2 = 121$ but $121$ is outside the specified range, so only four perfect squares will be considered.\nThird step:\nConsider the case where $n$ is the square of a prime raised to an even power, or the product of two distinct primes.

In this case, $n$ divides $g(n)$ since $p^4$ is divisible by $p^3$. Similarly, consider the case where $n$ is the power of a prime raised to an odd power $n=p^{2k+1}$, the proper divisors are $1, p, p^2, \\ldots, p^{2k}$ and their product is $p^{k(2k+1)}$.
