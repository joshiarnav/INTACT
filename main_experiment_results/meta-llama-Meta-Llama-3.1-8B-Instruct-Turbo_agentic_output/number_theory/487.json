    "model_solution": "To solve the system of linear congruences, first simplify the given congruences:\n\n1. $4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$ simplifies to $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$ (divide both sides by 4, and note that 4 and 20 share a common factor of 4 which is removed from the modulus and the coefficient).\n2. $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$ remains unchanged for now.\n\nNext, express $x$ in terms of the modulus $20$. Since $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$, we can write $x=5n+2$ for some integer $n$.\nSubstitute $x=5n+2$ into $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$, yielding $3(5n+2)\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$. This simplifies to $15n+6\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$. Since $15n\\equiv 5n\\pmod{20}$, the congruence simplifies to $5n\\equiv 10\\pmod{20}$.\nSince $5n\\equiv 10\\pmod{20}$, it simplifies to $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{4}$ (divide both sides by 5, noting that 5 and 20 share a common factor of 5 which is removed from the modulus and the coefficient). Express $n$ in terms of the modulus $20$: $n=4m+2$ for some integer $m$. Then, substitute $n=4m+2$ into $x=5n+2$, yielding $x=5(4m+2)+2$, which simplifies to $x=20m+12$.\nTo find the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$, substitute $x=20m+12$ into $x^2$, yielding $x^2=(20m+12)^2$. Since $20m$ is divisible by $20$, it does not affect the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$. Therefore, consider the square of the remainder when $x$ is divided by $20$: $12^2\\equiv 144\\pmod{20}$. Since $144=20(7)+4$, it follows that $x^2\\equiv 4\\pmod{20}$.\nThe next step is to conclude the solution based on the congruence $x^2\\equiv 4\\pmod{20}$, since we have found that the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$ is equivalent to $4\\pmod{20}$.\nSince $x^2\\equiv 4\\pmod{20}$, it follows that the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
