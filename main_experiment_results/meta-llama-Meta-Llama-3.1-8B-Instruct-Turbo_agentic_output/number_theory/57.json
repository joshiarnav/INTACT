    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 10\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 12\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 10+4+12 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $24$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
