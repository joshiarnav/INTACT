    "problem": "Let $T = \\{9^k : k ~ \\mbox{is an integer}, 0 \\le k \\le 4000\\}$. Given that $9^{4000}$ has 3817 digits and that its first (leftmost) digit is 9, how many elements of $T$ have 9 as their leftmost digit?\n",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since $9^{4000}$ has 3816 digits more than $9^1$, $4000 - 3816 = \\boxed{184}$ numbers have 9 as their leftmost digits.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of elements in set $T$ with 9 as their leftmost digit. \n\nFirst step: Since $9^{4000}$ has 3817 digits and starts with a 9, the numbers in $T$ that also start with a 9 are the numbers in the form $9^{4000 - m}$ where $m$ is a positive integer less than or equal to 3816.\nSecond step: The number of elements of $T$ with 9 as their leftmost digit is the number of positive integers $m$ less than or equal to 3816 (i.e., $0 \\le m \\le 3816$), which is 3816 + 1 = 3817.\n\nHowever, we are not done yet. We need to subtract the powers of 9 that have fewer than 3817 digits and start with a 9. The largest power of 9 with fewer than 3817 digits is $9^{3816}$, which has 3816 digits and starts with a 9. This number also needs to be excluded from our count.\nThird step: We must also subtract the number of integers $m$ that satisfy $3817 \\le m \\le 4000$. This is equal to $4000 - 3817 + 1 = 184$. The total count is then $3817 - 184 = 3633$.\nFourth step: The count of elements in set $T$ with 9 as their leftmost digit is $3633$.\nFifth step: Given that $9^{3817}$ still starts with a 9 since its number of digits does not decrease with the decrease of $m$ in the form of $9^{4000 - m}$, we must also subtract the number of integers $m$ that satisfy $3816 < m \\le 3816$. This is equal to 1.\nSixth step: Subtract the additional count of 1 from the previous result to obtain the final count of elements of $T$ with 9 as their leftmost digit.\nSeventh step: The total count is therefore $3633 - 1 = 3632$.\nEighth step: Since this is the final step, the solution is complete. The final count of elements of $T$ with 9 as their leftmost digit is $\\boxed{3632}$.",
