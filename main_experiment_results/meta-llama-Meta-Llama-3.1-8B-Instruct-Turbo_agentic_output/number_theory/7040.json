    "model_solution": "To find the largest 7-10 double, let's first consider the base-7 representation of $N$ as $abc$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the digits in base-7. Then, the base-10 representation of $N$ is $2(49a + 7b + c)$.\nSince the base-10 representation of $N$ must be twice $N$, we have $2(49a+7b+c) = 7^2a+7^1b+7^0c = 98a+7b+c$. Simplifying, we have $(49-98)a + (7-1)b + (1)c = 0$ which simplifies further to $-49a+6b+c = 0$.\nSince we have $-49a + 6b + c = 0$, we can rewrite this as $c = 49a - 6b$.\n\nTo maximize $N$, we want to maximize $a$ first, then $b$, and finally $c$. \n\nWe note that $c$ is the least significant digit. Therefore, to maximize $c$, we must make sure that $49a$ is greater than or equal to $6b$, because $c$ must be non-negative. Let's select the largest possible value of $a$ and check whether we can find a corresponding value of $b$ that satisfies the inequality $49a \\geq 6b$.\nWe select the largest possible value of $a$, which is $a=6$, since $a$ cannot be greater than 6 because then $49a$ would be greater than or equal to 294, and the base-7 representation of $N$ would not be a 3-digit number. We substitute $a=6$ into the inequality $49a \\geq 6b$ to get $294 \\geq 6b$.\nNow that we have selected $a = 6$, we need to find the largest possible value of $b$ such that $294 \\geq 6b$. Dividing both sides by 6, we get $b \\leq 49$ and since $b$ is a digit, we can try the largest possible value of $b$ in base-7, which is $6$ (as $b$ cannot be greater than 6 because then $49a - 6b$ would be negative).\nNow that we have selected $a = 6$ and $b = 6$, we need to find the corresponding value of $c$. Substituting $a = 6$ and $b = 6$ into the equation $c = 49a - 6b$, we get $c = 49(6) - 6(6) = 294 - 36 = 258$. However, this is not a digit in base-7. Therefore, our values of $a$ and $b$ are too large. We will try the next largest values of $a$ and $b$.\nThe next step is to try the next largest values of $a$ and $b$. We select the next largest possible value of $a$, which is $a=5$, since $a$ cannot be greater than 5 because then $49a$ would be greater than or equal to 245, and the base-7 representation of $N$ would not be a 3-digit number. We substitute $a=5$ into the inequality $49a \\geq 6b$ to get $245 \\geq 6b$. Now that we have selected $a = 5$, we need to find the largest possible value of $b$ such that $245 \\geq 6b$. Dividing both sides by 6, we get $b \\leq 40.833$. Since $b$ is a digit, we can try the largest possible value of $b$ in base-7, which is $6$.

We substitute $a=4$ into the inequality $49a \\geq 6b$ to get $196 \\geq 6b$. Now that we have selected $a = 4$, we need to find the largest possible value of $b$ such that $196 \\geq 6b$. Dividing both sides by 6, we get $b \\leq 32.666$. Since $b$ is a digit and the largest possible value of $b$ in base-7 is 6, we can try this value.\nNow that we have selected $a = 4$ and $b = 6$, we need to find the corresponding value of $c$. Substituting $a = 4$ and $b = 6$ into the equation $c = 49a - 6b$, we get $c = 49(4) - 6(6) = 196-36 = 160$. However, this is not a digit in base-7. Therefore, our values of $a$ and $b$ are too large. We will try the next largest values of $a$ and $b$. \n\nThe next step is to try the next largest values of $a$ and $b$. We select the next largest possible value of $a$, which is $a=3$, since $a$ cannot be greater than 3 because then $49a$ would be greater than or equal to 147, and the base-7 representation of $N$ would not be a 3-digit number.

We need to find the corresponding value of $c$. Substituting $a = 3$ and $b = 6$ into the equation $c = 49a - 6b$, we get $c = 49(3) - 6(6) = 147 - 36 = 111$. However, this is not a digit in base-7. Therefore, our value of $b$ is too large. We will try the next largest value of $b$.\n\nThe largest possible value of $b$ in base-7 is 5.
