    "solution": "We know that $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ for some prime $p$. We want to find the smallest odd possible value of $p$. By squaring both sides of the congruence, we find $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is a positive divisor of $16$.\nHowever, if the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $1, 2, 4,$ or $8,$ then $2019^8$ will be equivalent to $1 \\pmod{p},$ which contradicts the given requirement that $2019^8\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$.\nTherefore, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $16$. Because all orders modulo $p$ divide $\\phi(p)$, we see that $\\phi(p)$ is a multiple of $16$. As $p$ is prime, $\\phi(p) = p\\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{p}\\right) = p - 1$. Therefore, $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$. The two smallest primes equivalent to $1 \\pmod{16}$ are $17$ and $97$. As $2019^8 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$ and $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{97}$, the smallest possible $p$ is thus $\\boxed{97}$.",

    "model_solution": "We can start by noting that $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ for some prime $p$. This implies that $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, we can apply Euler's Theorem, which states that if $\\gcd(a,p)=1$, then $a^{\\phi(p)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. Since $p$ is a prime, $\\phi(p) = p-1$. \n\nTherefore, $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ implies that $16$ divides $p-1$.\nSince $16$ divides $p-1$, we can list the possible values of $p-1$: $16, 32, 48, 64$. Adding $1$ to each value, we get the possible values of $p$: $17, 33, 49, 65$. However, for $p=49$, $2019^8 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ (since $2019^8 \\equiv 3^8 \\pmod{7^2}$). Thus, the possible values for $p$ are $17, 33, 65$. \n\nChecking these values by plugging them into the original congruence, we find that the first value, $p=17$, indeed satisfies $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$.\nSince $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$ is a solution, and $17$ is the smallest possible value of $p$, $17$ is the smallest odd prime factor of $2019^8+1$.\nBy checking $p=17$ in the original congruence, we have established that $17$ is indeed a solution. Since it is the smallest possible value of $p$, the next step is to verify that $17$ is the least odd prime factor, which we have done. Therefore, the least odd prime factor of $2019^8+1$ is $\\boxed{17}$.",
