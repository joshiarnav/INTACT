    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The units digit of $mn$ is $1^6 = 1$.  Searching for a units digit for $n$ (which is clearly odd), we find that $7 \\cdot 3 = 1$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit of $n$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the units digit of $n$, we first note that $mn = 21^6$. \n\nStep 1: Find the units digit of $21^6$. The units digit of a power is determined by the units digit of the base raised to that power. In this case, the units digit of 21 is 1, so we need to find the units digit of $1^6$.\nStep 2: Since the units digit of $1^6$ is 1, the units digit of $21^6$ is also 1.\nStep 3: Since the product of the units digits of $mn$ is equal to the units digit of $mn$, which is 1, and the units digit of $m$ is 7, the units digit of $n$ must be the number such that when multiplied by 7 gives a units digit of 1.\nStep 1: To find the units digit of $n$, we need to find the number such that when multiplied by 7 gives a units digit of 1. The units digit of $n$ is the number that, when multiplied by 7, results in a number with a units digit of 1. This is the same as finding the number that, when multiplied by 7, gives a units digit of 1. \n\nStep 2: Because $7 \\times 3 = 21$ and the units digit of $21$ is $1$, the units digit of $n$ must be $3$.\nStep 3:\nSince the units digit of $n$ must be 3, as found in the previous step, we conclude that the units digit of $n$ is indeed 3.\nStep 4:\nTherefore, the units digit of $n$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
