    "problem": "For some positive integer $k$, when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. What is the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the given information: When 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. This can be represented as $60 = qk^2 + 6$, where $q$ is the quotient. \n\nRearranging the equation gives us $60 - 6 = qk^2$, which simplifies to $54 = qk^2$.\nSince $54 = qk^2$, and we know that $54 = 9 \\times 6$, $k^2$ must be a factor of 54.\nSince $k^2$ must be a factor of 54, we find the factors of 54, which are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54. Taking the square root of these factors gives the possible values for $k$, which are 1, $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3}$, $\\sqrt{6}$, 3, $\\sqrt{18}$, $\\sqrt{27}$, and $\\sqrt{54}$. Since $k$ is a positive integer, we discard the non-integer values, leaving $k$ as 1 or 3. \n\nTo find the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$, we can test the possible values of $k$.\nNow, we can test the possible values of $k$ (1 and 3) by dividing 100 by each value to find the remainder.\n\n- When 100 is divided by 1, the remainder is 0.\n- When 100 is divided by 3, the remainder is 1.\n\nSince we are looking for a positive integer $k$, we consider $k = 3$ (as $k = 1$ does not provide a remainder, it gives a quotient).\nSince we found that $k = 3$, we can now conclude that the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$ is the same as the remainder when 100 is divided by 3, which is 1.\n\nHowever, we were asked to consider that for some positive integer $k$, when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. It is also possible to verify if $k = 3$ indeed gives a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by $k^2$.\nTo verify if $k = 3$ indeed gives a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by $k^2$, we can substitute $k = 3$ back into the original equation $60 = qk^2 + 6$. Since $k^2 = 3^2 = 9$, we have 60 = q(9) + 6. Rearranging, we get 54 = 9q. This is true for q = 6, confirming that k = 3 satisfies the original condition.\nNow that we have verified that $k = 3$ satisfies the given condition, we conclude that the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
