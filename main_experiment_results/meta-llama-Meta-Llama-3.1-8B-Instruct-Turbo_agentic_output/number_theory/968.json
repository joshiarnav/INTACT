    "problem": "Three different natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors. How many factors does $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ have?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$, we first note that since $x$, $y$, and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors, they must be the square of prime numbers. \n\nLet's denote these prime numbers as $p$, $q$, and $r$. \n\nSo we have, $x=p^2$, $y=q^2$, and $z=r^2$.\nNow, we can express $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ as $(p^2)^2(q^2)^3(r^2)^4 = p^4q^6r^8$. Since the number of factors of a number $a^n$ where $a$ is a prime factor of the number, is given by $n+1$, the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ is $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)$.\nThe number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ is given by $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1) = 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 9$. To find the product, we multiply these numbers together. \n\nTo multiply these numbers, we can start with $5 \\cdot 9 = 45$ and then multiply by $7$.\nTo find the product, we multiply 45 by 7: \n\n45 * 7 = 315.\nThe final step is to determine the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$, which is given by the product $315$.\nTo find the final answer, we need to express the product 315 as a numerical value. \n\n315 = 5 * 63, \n63 = 7 * 9, \nSo, 315 = 5 * 7 * 9.\nTherefore, 315 is already the product of the numbers, so we can express the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ as 315.\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{315}$.",
