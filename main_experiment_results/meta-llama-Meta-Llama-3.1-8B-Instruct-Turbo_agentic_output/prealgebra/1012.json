Subtracting the two equations will help us solve for x.\nSubtracting the two equations, we get $9x = 3$, so $x = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nUsing the same method, we express $0.\\overline{2}$ as a fraction by letting $y = 0.\\overline{2}$, then multiplying both sides by 10 to get $10y = 2.\\overline{2}$. Subtracting the two equations, we get $9y = 2$, so $y = \\frac{2}{9}$. Then, $0.\\overline{3}+0.\\overline{2} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9}$.\nWe need to find a common denominator for $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{2}{9}$. The common denominator is 9.
