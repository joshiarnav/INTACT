    "model_solution": "To find the area of the shaded L-shaped region, we can break it down into simpler shapes. The L-shaped region can be formed by removing two smaller squares from the larger square. \n\nFirst, we need to find the area of the larger square. The side length of the larger square is 4 units (since 3 + 1 = 4), so the area of the larger square is 4^2 = 16 square units.\nNow, to find the area of the shaded L-shaped region, we need to subtract the areas of the two smaller squares from the area of the larger square. \n\nThe area of the first smaller square is $3^2 = 9$ square units. The area of the second smaller square is $1^2 = 1$ square unit.\nNow, to find the area of the shaded L-shaped region, we need to subtract the areas of the two smaller squares from the area of the larger square. So, the area of the shaded L-shaped region is 16 - 9 - 1.\nNow, we will subtract the areas of the two smaller squares from the area of the larger square. This gives us an area of 16 - 9 - 1 = 6 square units for the shaded L-shaped region.\nNow, we will calculate the final result: \n$16 - 9 - 1 = \\boxed{6}$\nNow, we will calculate the final result: \n$16 - 9 - 1 = \\boxed{6}$",
