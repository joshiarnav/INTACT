    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since they only ask for one length, you can assume that there's only one possible triangle.  Then, quickly note that $39 = 3\\cdot 13$, and that 5 - 12 - 13 is a Pythagorean triple.  Therefore, the shorter leg has length $\\boxed{15}$.",

Since a and b must be integers, we can look for pairs of perfect squares that add up to a number close to 39^2 = 1521.\nThe next step is to find pairs of perfect squares close to 1521. \n\nWe can start by listing perfect squares less than 1521: \n1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400, 441, 484, 529, 576, 625, 676, 729 (not close enough), 784 (not close enough), 841 (not close enough), 900 (not close enough), 961 (not close enough), 1089 (not close enough), 1225 (not close enough), 1369 (not close enough), 1521.\n\nWe can see that 36^2 = 1296 and 49^2 = 2401, but 36^2 + 15^2 is close to 1521. Now we have to check if 36^2 + 15^2 = 1521.\nTo verify if 36^2 + 15^2 equals 1521, we calculate: \n36^2 = 1296 and 15^2 = 225. \nAdding these two values: 1296 + 225 = 1521. \n\nThis confirms that 36 and 15 are indeed a pair of perfect squares that add up to 1521. Since a^2 + b^2 = c^2, we can now find the length of the shorter leg using a and b.\nSince we know 36^2 + 15^2 = 1521, we can substitute these values into the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the shorter leg. We have: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where c is 39 and b is 15. Plugging in the values, we get a^2 + 15^2 = 39^2. Simplifying, we get a^2 + 225 = 1521. Subtracting 225 from both sides, we get a^2 = 1296. Taking the square root of both sides, we get a = \u221a1296 = 36, which is not the shorter leg, as we already know the length of one of the legs is 36. However, we should note that in the step we added 36^2 to 15^2 to get 1521, that is the same as saying that 36 is one of the legs and 15 is one of the legs. This confirms that the pair (36, 15) is a valid solution for the lengths of the legs of the triangle. But we should find which one is the shorter leg. Since 36 is\nSince 36 is one of the legs, we need to find the other leg. We have already found that 36^2 + 15^2 = 1521. Therefore, the other leg must be 15, since 36 is the length of one of the legs we already know. However, we also know that the other leg should be the shorter leg.
