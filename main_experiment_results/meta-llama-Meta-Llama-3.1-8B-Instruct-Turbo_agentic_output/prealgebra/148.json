    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To calculate the average of two numbers, we add them and divide the sum by $2$.  From the given information, we have the equation  \\[\\frac{23+x}{2}=27.\\]  Multiplying both sides by $2$ yields \\[23+x=54.\\]  Thus, $x=54-23=31$.  Finally, the positive difference between $31$ and $23$ is \\[31-23=\\boxed{8}.\\]",
