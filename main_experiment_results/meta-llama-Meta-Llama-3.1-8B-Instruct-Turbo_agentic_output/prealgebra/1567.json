    "problem": "How many integers between 1 and 200 are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Integers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 must be multiples of 15.  We can start by listing the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200: $$15,30,45,60,75,90,105,120,135,150,165,180,195$$ Checking only the even numbers, we can eliminate those that are multiples of 4, leaving us with: $$15,30,45,75,90,105,135,150,165,195$$ Finally, we need to eliminate any remaining multiples of 7.  The only multiples of 7 we need to be concerned with are those ending in 5 or 0.  The only number on the list that is a multiple of 7 is 105.  Our final list is: $$15,30,45,75,90,135,150,165,195$$ This leaves us with $\\boxed{9}$ integers.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will first find the number of integers between 1 and 200 that are multiples of both 3 and 5. \n\nFirst step: \nFind the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5. \nLCM(3, 5) = 15, since 15 is the smallest number that both 3 and 5 divide into evenly.\nNext step:\nFind how many multiples of 15 are between 1 and 200. \nTo find this, divide 200 by 15 and round down to the nearest whole number, since multiples are whole numbers. \n\n200 / 15 = 13.333, rounded down is 13. \n\nSo, there are 13 multiples of 15 between 1 and 200.\nNext step: \nFind how many of these multiples are also multiples of 4 or 7. To do this, find the LCM of 15 and 4 (LCM(15, 4) = 60), and LCM(15, 7) (LCM(15, 7) = 105). Then count the multiples of 60 and 105 between 1 and 200 (using the same division method), and subtract the total from 13 to find the final answer.\nTo find the number of multiples of 60 and 105 between 1 and 200, divide 200 by 60 and 105, and round down to the nearest whole number for each.\n\n200 / 60 = 3.333, rounded down is 3.\n200 / 105 = 1.904, rounded down is 1.\n\nNow, subtract the total multiples of 60 and 105 from the multiples of 15 to get the final answer.\nSince we've found that there are 3 multiples of 60 and 1 multiple of 105 between 1 and 200, we need to account for the multiples of 420 (LCM(60, 105)) since they've been counted twice. \n\nFind how many multiples of 420 are between 1 and 200 by dividing 200 by 420 and rounding down to the nearest whole number. \n\n200 / 420 = 0.476, rounded down is 0.\nSince multiples of 420 have been counted twice, subtract them once to avoid double subtraction. However, there are no multiples of 420 between 1 and 200, so we don't need to do anything. The final answer is simply the number of multiples of 15 minus the multiples of 60 and 105, which is 13 - 3 - 1 = $\\boxed{9}$.",
