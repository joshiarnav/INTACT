    "problem": "A 12-slice pizza was made with only pepperoni and mushroom toppings, and every slice has at least one topping. Only six slices have pepperoni, and exactly ten slices have mushrooms. How many slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are 12 total slices, and 6 of them have pepperoni and 10 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number of the slices that have both toppings, so there are $6-n$ with just pepperoni and $10-n$ with just mushrooms.  Since every slice has at least one topping, and there are 12 slices, we must have $(6-n) + (10-n) + n = 12$, which gives $n=\\boxed{4}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Let's denote the number of slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms as 'x'. We can then set up equations based on the given information. Since every slice has at least one topping, and there are 12 slices in total, the total number of slices with pepperoni, mushrooms, or both can be expressed as 6x (slices with pepperoni) + 10 (slices with mushrooms) - x (to avoid double counting slices with both toppings) = 12.\nStep 2: We can simplify the equation by combining like terms: 6x + 10 - x = 12, which becomes 5x + 10 = 12. \n\nTo find the value of x, subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 5x = 2.\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to solve for x: x = 2 / 5.\nStep 4: Since 'x' represents the number of slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms, and the result of the calculation is a fraction, this indicates a contradiction to the given problem statement. However, if we consider the context and re-evaluate the initial steps, there might be an error in the equation. Given that 6 slices have pepperoni and 10 slices have mushrooms, we can use the total slices (12) to find the slices that do not have pepperoni and the slices that do not have mushrooms. Alternatively, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find the correct number of slices with both toppings.\n\nHowever, the problem is more easily solved by the inclusion-exclusion principle than initially approached: \nTotal slices = slices with pepperoni + slices with mushrooms - slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms.\nStep 4: Given the total number of slices with pepperoni (6), mushrooms (10), and the total number of slices (12), we can set up the inclusion-exclusion principle equation as 6 + 10 - x = 12. \n\nSolving for x, we have: \n6 + 10 - x = 12\n16 - x = 12\n-x = -4\nx = 4\nStep 5: \nSince x represents the number of slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms, the result indicates that 4 slices have both toppings.\nStep 6:\nThe problem states that every slice has at least one topping, and we've found that 4 slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms. This information confirms that our solution does not produce any contradictions, and the value of x aligns with the given conditions.\n\nIf this is the final step, the final answer is:\n$\\boxed{4}$",
