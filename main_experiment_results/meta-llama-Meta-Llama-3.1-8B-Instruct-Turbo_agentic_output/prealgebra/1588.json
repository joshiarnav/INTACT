    "solution": "All three integers must be divisors of $7^3$.  The only divisors of $7^3$ are $7^0$, $7^1$, $7^2$, $7^3$.  We have $7^3=7^0\\times7^1\\times7^2$. Thus our answer is $7^0+7^1+7^2=1+7+49=\\boxed{57}$.",

Since $7^3 = 7 \\times 7 \\times 7$, we can write it as $7^3 = 7^1 \\times 7^1 \\times 7^1$.\nSince we have $7^3 = 7^1 \\times 7^1 \\times 7^1$, we can rewrite it as $7^3 = 7 \\times 7 \\times 7$. Now, we need to find three different positive integers that multiply to $7^3$. Given that 1 is a factor of any number, the three integers are 1, 7, and $7^2 = 49$.\nThe next step is to find the sum of the three integers, which is $1 + 7 + 49 = 57$.\nThe next step is to find the sum of the three integers, which is $1 + 7 + 49 = 57$.",
