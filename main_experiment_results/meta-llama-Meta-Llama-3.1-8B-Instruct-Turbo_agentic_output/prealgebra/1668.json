    "solution": "The chart shows the amounts of sales at the end of each year.  Therefore we're looking for a year on the chart that has the largest difference from the previous year.    Determining the sales that increased the most number of dollars is equivalent to finding the right endpoint of the segment with the steepest slope.  From observation, we can determine that that line corresponds to the year $\\boxed{1998}$.",

We can do this by finding the vertical distance between each pair of consecutive points on the graph, which can be calculated as follows:\n\n- 1996 - 1994 = 2 points\n- 1998 - 1996 = 2.4 points\n- 2000 - 1998 = 3 points\n- 2002 - 2000 = 3.25 points\n- 2002 - 2000 = 4.2 points\n- 2000 - 1998 = 4.5 points\n- 1998 - 1996 = 4.8 points\n- 1996 - 1994 = 5.2 points\n- 1998 - 2000 = 4.75 points\n- 2000 - 1998 = 3.25 points\n\nWe can see that the greatest increase in sales occurred between 1996 and 1994 with a difference of 5.2 points, but since we are looking for the year after 1994, we need to find the greatest increase between years 199\nSince we want the greatest increase after 1994, we need to ignore the first pair (1996 - 1994) and find the largest difference in the remaining pairs.
