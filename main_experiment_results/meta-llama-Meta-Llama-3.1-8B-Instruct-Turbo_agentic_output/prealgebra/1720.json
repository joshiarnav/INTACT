    "problem": "Given three members of a group -- Alice, Bob, and Carol -- in how many ways can these three be chosen to be the three officers (president, secretary, and treasurer) of the group, assuming no person holds more than one job?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "In this problem we are choosing a committee, so the order in which we choose the 3 people does not matter.  We could have chosen them in any of the following orders (where A is Alice, B is Bob, and C is Carol): ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.  So each possible committee corresponds to $3! = \\boxed{6}$ possible orderings.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of permutations.\n\nStep 1:\nThere are three positions to fill (president, secretary, and treasurer), and we have three people to choose from (Alice, Bob, and Carol). The first step is to select the person for the first position (president).\nStep 2:\nOnce the president is chosen, there are two positions and two people left to choose from. The person chosen for the president position can no longer hold a job, so we have 2 choices for the second position (secretary), and then 1 choice for the last position (treasurer). \n\nHowever, since we're using the concept of permutations, we must multiply the number of choices at each step.\nStep 3:\nNow, considering all the previous steps, we multiply the number of choices at each step to get the total number of ways the officers can be chosen. \n\nSo, the number of ways to choose the officers is:\n\n3 (choices for president) \u00d7 2 (choices for secretary) \u00d7 1 (choice for treasurer) \n\n= 6\nStep 4: \nWe have now determined the total number of ways to choose the three officers (president, secretary, and treasurer) from the group.\nStep 4:\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{6}$ ways to choose the three officers (president, secretary, and treasurer) from the group.",
