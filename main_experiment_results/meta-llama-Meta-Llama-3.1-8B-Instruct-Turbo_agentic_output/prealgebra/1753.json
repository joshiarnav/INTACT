We need to find the sum of the areas of the two squares $ABCD$ and $AEFG$.\nStep 2:  To approach this problem, we will first utilize the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is $BE$, and the other two sides are $AE$ and $AB$.\nStep 3:  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can express the relationship between the sides as $AE^2 + AB^2 = BE^2$.\nStep 4:  Given that $BE = 9$ units, we can substitute this value into the equation $AE^2 + AB^2 = BE^2$ to solve for the sum of the areas of the two squares $ABCD$ and $AEFG$. Substituting $BE = 9$ yields $AE^2 + AB^2 = 9^2$, which simplifies to $AE^2 + AB^2 = 81$.\nStep 5: \nThe sum of the areas of the two squares $ABCD$ and $AEFG$ is equal to the sum of the squares of their respective side lengths, which is $AE^2 + AB^2$. We have already found that $AE^2 + AB^2 = 81$. Therefore, the sum of the areas of the two squares is $81$ square units.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the number of square units in the sum of the areas of the two squares $ABCD$ and $AEFG$ is $\\boxed{81}$.",
