    "solution": "Let $x$ denote the measure in degrees of $\\angle BOC$.  Because $\\angle BOD$ and $\\angle COA$ are right angles, $\\angle COD$ and $\\angle BOA$ each measure $90-x$ degrees.  Therefore $\\angle AOD=x+(90-x)+(90-x)$ degrees.  Solving \\[\n3.5x=x+90-x+90-x\n\\]we find $x=180/4.5=40$.  Therefore $\\angle AOD=180^\\circ-40^\\circ=\\boxed{140\\text{ degrees}}$.",
