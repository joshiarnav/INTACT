    "problem": "In order to compute the area of a particular circle, Juan first measures the length of its diameter. The actual diameter is 20 cm, but Juan's measurement has an error of up to $20\\%$. What is the largest possible percent error, in percent, in Juan's computed area of the circle?",

    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Juan can measure the diameter as a length anywhere between $20 - 20\\cdot 0.2 = 16$ and $20 + 20\\cdot 0.2 = 24$  cm. The actual area of the circle is $\\pi (20/2)^2=100\\pi$ square cm, but Juan can compute the area anywhere in the range $\\pi (16/2)^2=64 \\pi$ square cm to $\\pi (24/2)^2=144 \\pi$ square cm. Using the lower bound of the range, Juan's error is $(100\\pi - 64\\pi)/(100\\pi)=36\\%$. Using the upper bound of the range, Juan's error is $(144\\pi - 100\\pi)/(100\\pi)=44\\%$. Thus, the largest possible percent error is $\\boxed{44}$ percent.",

The percent error in Juan's computed area is the percent by which his result differs from the true area. This percent error can also be expressed as the percent by which his measured diameter differs from the true diameter. Since his measured diameter was 24 cm (the largest possible) and the true diameter was 20 cm, the difference is 4 cm. The percent error in the diameter is (4/20) * 100 = 20%.\nSince the percent error in the diameter is 20% and the area is a function of the square of the diameter, the largest possible percent error in Juan's computed area of the circle will be equal to twice the percent error in his measurement of the diameter.
