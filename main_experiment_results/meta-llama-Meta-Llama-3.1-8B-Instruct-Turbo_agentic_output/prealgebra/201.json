    "problem": "If only one quarter of the earth's surface is not covered by bodies of water, and only one half of that exposed land area is inhabitable for humans (because of poles, deserts, etc.), what fraction of the earth's surface can humans live on?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "One half of one quarter of the earth is $\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{4}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on, first, we need to find the fraction of the earth's surface that is not covered by bodies of water. Since one quarter of the earth's surface is not covered by water, this fraction is 1/4.\nTo find the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on, we need to find one half of the fraction of the earth's surface that is not covered by bodies of water. This is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\nWe have found that $\\frac{1}{8}$ of the earth's surface is inhabitable for humans.\nNow, to express the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on as a single fraction, we must express $\\frac{1}{8}$ in terms of the total fraction of the earth's surface that is not covered by bodies of water, $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince we need to express $\\frac{1}{8}$ in terms of $\\frac{1}{4}$, we can write $\\frac{1}{8}$ as $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}$. Then, to isolate $\\frac{1}{4}$, we multiply both sides by $\\frac{2}{1}$ (the reciprocal of $\\frac{1}{2}$), resulting in $\\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{2}{1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$. However, since we are solving for the fraction of land that is inhabitable for humans, we need to compare it to the portion of the earth not covered by water. $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the portion of the earth not covered by water is $\\frac{1}{4}$, so $\\frac{1}{8}$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}}$",
