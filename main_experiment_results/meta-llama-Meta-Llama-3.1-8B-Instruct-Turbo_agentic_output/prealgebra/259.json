    "problem": "A toy store manager received a large order of Mr. Slinkums just in time for the holidays. The manager places $20\\%$ of them on the shelves, leaving the other 120 Mr. Slinkums in storage. How many Mr. Slinkums were in this order?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If $20\\%$ of the toys were put on the shelves, the $80\\%$ of the toys were left in storage.  Therefore, we are given $80\\% T=120$, where $T$ is the number of toys in the order.  Rewriting $80\\%$ as $\\frac{4}{5}$ and multiplying both sides by $\\frac{5}{4}$, we find that $T=120\\cdot\\frac{5}{4}=30\\cdot 5=\\boxed{150}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let x be the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order. Since 20% of them were placed on the shelves, the remaining 80% are in storage, which is equal to 120.\n\nSo, 80% of x = 120.\nTo find the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order, convert 80% to a decimal (0.8) and solve for x: \n\n0.8x = 120\n\nDivide both sides by 0.8 to isolate x:\n\nx = 120 / 0.8\nNow, divide 120 by 0.8 to find the value of x: \nx = 120 / 0.8 = 150\nSince we have found x, we have solved the problem.
