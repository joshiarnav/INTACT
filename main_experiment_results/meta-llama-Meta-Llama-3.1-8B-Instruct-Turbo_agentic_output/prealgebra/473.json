    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To round $18.4851$ to the nearest hundredth, we must look at the hundreds and the thousands digits of the number in question. Since the thousands digit ($5$) is greater than or equal to $5$, the hundreds digit $8$ rounds up to $9$. Therefore, $18.4851$ rounded to the nearest hundredth is equal to $\\boxed{18.49}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To round to the nearest hundredth, look at the thousandth place (5 in this case).\nSince the digit in the thousandth place is 5, it is exactly halfway between a number ending in .48 and .49. To round to the nearest hundredth, look at the digit in the ten-thousandth place (1 in this case). If it's 5 or greater, round up; if it's 4 or less, round down. In this case, it's 1, so round down from .49 to .48. \n\nThe result is: $\\boxed{18.48}$",
