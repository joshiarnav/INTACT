    "problem": "The circular region of the sign (below, left) has an area of 154 square inches. Vanessa would like to place a tiny ribbon (shaded) around the circle's edge. To be sure she has enough ribbon, she decides to buy 2 inches more of the ribbon than the original circle's circumference. How many inches of ribbon will Vanessa need to buy if she estimates $\\pi = \\frac{22}{7}$?\n\n[asy]import graph;\nsize(125,72.5);\npicture p;\ndraw(p,unitsquare);\nfilldraw(p,Circle((.5,.5),.3),white);\nlabel(p,\"Enter\",(.5,.5),ZapfChancery(\"m\",\"n\"));\nadd(p);\nfilldraw(Circle((2,.5),.4),gray(.6));\nadd(shift(1.5*right)*p);\ndraw((1.1,.5)--(1.4,.5),EndArrow(5,25));[/asy]",

    "solution": "Say the radius of the circle is $r$. Then the area of the circle is $\\pi r^2,$ which we estimate to $154=\\frac{22}{7}r^2$. If we multiply both sides by $\\frac{7}{22}$, we get $r^2=49$ or $r=7$. The circle's circumference is $2\\pi r$, which we again estimate to $\\frac{44}{7}r=44$. Vanessa wants two extra inches of ribbon, so she needs to buy $44+2=\\boxed{46}$ inches of ribbon.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Estimate the value of \u03c0 as 22/7 and set up the equation to find the radius of the circular region.\nFor a circle, the area A = \u03c0r^2. Given the area A = 154 square inches and \u03c0 \u2248 22/7, we can write the equation as:\n154 = (22/7)r^2.\nStep 2: Multiply both sides of the equation by 7 to eliminate the fraction, resulting in:\n1092 = 22r^2.\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 22 to isolate r^2, and then take the square root of both sides to find the radius r. The equation becomes:\nr^2 = 1092 / 22\nr^2 = 49.6364\nr = \u221a49.6364 \u2248 7.04\nNow that we have the radius, we can calculate the circumference of the circle. The equation for the circumference C is C = 2\u03c0r, and with our estimated value of \u03c0, it becomes C = (2 * 22/7)r.\nStep 4:  Now that we have the radius r \u2248 7.04, we can calculate the original circumference of the circle using the equation C = (2 * 22/7)r, which simplifies to C = (44/7)r. Plugging in the value of r, we get C = (44/7) * 7.04 \u2248 50.59. To be safe, Vanessa wants to buy 2 extra inches of ribbon, so she needs to buy 50.59 + 2 \u2248 52.59 inches of ribbon.\nStep 5:  Vanessa needs to buy 2 extra inches of ribbon, so she needs to buy the calculated circumference plus 2 inches, which is 50.59 + 2 = 52.59 inches of ribbon.\nStep 6:  Since Vanessa needs to buy 2 extra inches of ribbon, we already calculated the circumference plus 2 inches, which is 52.59 inches of ribbon. This is the final amount she needs.\nStep 7:  Rounding the estimated amount of ribbon to the nearest tenth, Vanessa will need to buy $\\boxed{52.6}$ inches of ribbon.",
