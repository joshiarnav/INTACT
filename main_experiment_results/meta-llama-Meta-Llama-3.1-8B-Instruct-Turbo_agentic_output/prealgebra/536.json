    "problem": "A zoo has a menagerie containing four pairs of different animals, one male and one female for each. The zookeeper wishes to feed the animals in a specific pattern: each time he feeds a single animal, the next one he feeds must be a different gender. If he starts by feeding the male giraffe, how many ways can he feed all the animals?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If the zookeeper starts with the male giraffe, there are 4 females which he can feed next. Once one is selected, there are 3 males he can feed next, then 3 females, 2 males, 2 females, 1 male, and 1 female.\n\nThe total number of possibilities is $4\\times3\\times3\\times2\\times2 = \\boxed{144}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of permutations since the order of feeding matters. \n\nStep 1: We have 4 males and 4 females. Since the zookeeper starts by feeding a male (the giraffe), we need to determine the number of ways he can choose the next female to feed.\n\nSince there are 4 females, he can choose any one of them, so the number of ways to choose the next female is 4.\nStep 2: After feeding the next female, the zookeeper must feed a male, but this time there are 3 males left (since the giraffe has already been fed) and 3 females left. He must choose a male, and then he must feed a female, and so on. This pattern continues until he feeds the last male. Since he must alternate between males and females, and there are 4 of each, he will have 4 opportunities to choose a male and 4 opportunities to choose a female (excluding the giraffe which he already fed). The number of ways to choose the next male is 3, the next female is 3, the next male is 2, the next female is 2, the next male is 1, the next female is 1, the last male is 0 (implying only 1 way), and the last female is 0 (implying only 1 way). The total number of ways is then 4 (for the first female) multiplied by 3 (for the first male) multiplied by 3 (for the second female) multiplied by 2 (for the second male) multiplied by 2 (for the third female)\nStep 3: Multiply the remaining numbers together to get the total number of possible ways to feed the animals. \n\nSo, we have: \n4 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1\nStep 4: Calculate the product of the numbers to find the total number of ways to feed the animals. \n\n4 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 144\nStep 4: Calculate the product of the numbers to find the total number of ways to feed the animals.\n\n4 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 = 144\n\nNow multiply the remaining numbers together: \n144 * 1 * 1 = 144\nStep 5: Multiply the remaining numbers together to get the total number of possible ways to feed the animals. \n\n144 * 1 * 1 = 144\nStep 5: Multiply the remaining numbers together to get the total number of possible ways to feed the animals.\n\n144 * 1 * 1 = 144\nStep 6: The final calculation has been completed, so the total number of ways the zookeeper can feed all the animals is 144.\nStep $\\boxed{6}$: The final calculation has been completed, so the total number of ways the zookeeper can feed all the animals is 144.",
