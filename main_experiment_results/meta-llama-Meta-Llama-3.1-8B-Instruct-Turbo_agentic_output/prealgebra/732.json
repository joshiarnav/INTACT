    "problem": "Amanda, Ben, and Carlos share a sum of money. Their portions are in the ratio of 1:2:7, respectively. If Amanda's portion is $\\$$20, what is the total amount of money shared?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We multiply each part of the ratio $1:2:7$ by 20 to make Amanda's part equal 20, and we have \\[1:2:7 = 1\\cdot 20:2\\cdot 20 :7\\cdot 20 = 20:40:140.\\] This means that  Ben's share is $2\\times 20 = 40$ dollars and Carlos's share is $7\\times 20=140$ dollars.  Therefore, the total amount of money shared is $20+40+140=\\boxed{200}$ dollars.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total amount of money shared, first, we need to determine the portions of Ben and Carlos. Since their portions are in the ratio of 1:2:7 with Amanda's portion, and we know Amanda's portion is $\\$$20, we can set up a proportion based on Amanda's fraction of the total.\nSince the ratio of Amanda's portion to Ben's portion to Carlos's portion is 1:2:7, and we know that Amanda's portion is $\\$$20, we can set up the following equation: \n$\\frac{1}{1+2+7} = \\frac{20}{x}$ where x is the total amount of money shared.\nSimplifying the left-hand side gives: \n$\\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{20}{x}$\nTo find x, we can cross multiply and solve for x: \n1x = 10 * 20\nx = 200\nSince we've found the total amount of money shared, we can confirm that the ratio is correct by checking the portions of Ben and Carlos. Their portions are in the ratio of 2:7, so we can set up the equation $\\frac{2}{1+2+7} = \\frac{y}{20}$ where y is Ben's portion and $\\frac{7}{1+2+7} = \\frac{z}{20}$ where z is Carlos's portion. Solving these equations will confirm that Ben's portion is $\\$40$ and Carlos's portion is $\\$140$, and the ratio 1:2:7 holds true.\nTo confirm the correctness of the ratio, we'll solve the equation $\\frac{2}{1+2+7} = \\frac{y}{20}$ for y, which represents Ben's portion.\n\n$\\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{y}{20}$\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n2 * 20 = 10y\n40 = 10y\ny = 4 * 20 / 10\ny = 40\nTo confirm the correctness of the ratio, we'll also solve the equation $\\frac{7}{1+2+7} = \\frac{z}{20}$ for z, which represents Carlos's portion.\n\n$\\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{z}{20}$\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n7 * 20 = 10z\n140 = 10z\nz = 14 * 20 / 10\nz = 140\nTo find the total amount of money shared, we don't need to confirm the portions of Ben and Carlos.
