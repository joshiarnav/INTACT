    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "This question gives multiple clues on what $x$ could be. Because $x^2>100$, we know that $x$ must be greater than 10, but $x$ is also less than 20. So $x$ is a multiple of 8 that is between 10 and 20. The only value that fits this description is $\\boxed{16}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the possible values of $x$, we need to list the positive multiples of 8 that are less than 20: \n\n8, 16.\nSince $x^2>100$, we need to find the square of each possible value of $x$. The square of 8 is 64, and the square of 16 is 256, both of which are greater than 100. Therefore, we need to check which of these satisfies the condition $x<20$. Since 16 is less than 20, we have found that $x=16$.\nWe can conclude that the only possible value of $x$ is $16$, since it is the only multiple of 8 less than 20 and its square is greater than 100. \n\n$\\boxed{16}$",
