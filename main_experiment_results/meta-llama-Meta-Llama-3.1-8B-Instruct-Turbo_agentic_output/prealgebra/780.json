    "solution": "We first notice that the area of the shaded region is the area of the square minus the areas of the four quarter circles. Each quarter circle has a radius half the side length, so if we sum the areas of the four quarter circles, we have the area of one full circle with radius $5$ cm. Now, we know the area of a square is the square of its side length, so the square has an area of $100 \\text{ cm}^2$. A circle has an area of $\\pi$ times its radius squared, so the four quarter circles combined have an area of $\\pi(5)^2=25\\pi \\text{ cm}^2$. From this, we know that the area of the shaded region is $\\boxed{100-25\\pi} \\text{ cm}^2$.",

    "model_solution": "The first step is to calculate the area of the square. The area of the square is $A_{square} = side^2 = 10^2 = 100$ square centimeters.\nThe next step is to find the area of the four quarter circles. Since there are 4 quarter circles, the total area is equal to the area of 1 full circle with radius 5. The area of the circle is $A_{circle} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (5)^2 = 25\\pi$.\nThe next step is to find the area of the shaded region by subtracting the area of the circle from the area of the square, so the area of the shaded region is $A_{shaded} = A_{square} - A_{circle} = 100 - 25\\pi$.\nTo find the area of the shaded region, we subtract the area of the circle from the area of the square, so the area of the shaded region is $A_{shaded} = A_{square} - A_{circle} = 100 - 25\\pi$.\nThe next step is to express the area of the shaded region in terms of $\\pi$ without evaluating the expression, so the area of the shaded region is $A_{shaded} = 100 - 25\\pi$.\nThe final step is to express the area of the shaded region in terms of $\\pi$. Since the area is already in terms of $\\pi$, the next step is simply to present the final answer.\nThe final step is to present the final answer: $\\boxed{100 - 25\\pi}$",
