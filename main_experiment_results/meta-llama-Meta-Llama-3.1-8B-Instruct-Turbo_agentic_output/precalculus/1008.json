    "solution": "Since the point lies in the $xz$-plane, it is of the form $(x,0,z).$  We want this point to be equidistant to the points $(1,-1,0),$ $(2,1,2),$ and $(3,2,-1),$ which gives us the equations\n\\begin{align*}\n(x - 1)^2 + 1^2 + z^2 &= (x - 2)^2 + 1^2 + (z - 2)^2, \\\\\n(x - 1)^2 + 1^2 + z^2 &= (x - 3)^2 + 2^2 + (z + 1)^2.\n\\end{align*}These equations simplify to $2x + 4z = 7$ and $4x - 2z = 12.$  Solving these equation, we find $x = \\frac{31}{10}$ and $z = \\frac{1}{5},$ so the point we seek is $\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{31}{10}, 0, \\frac{1}{5} \\right)}.$",

For the first equation, adding $4x$ to both sides yields $2x + 1 = -4$. Subtracting $1$ from both sides gives $2x = -5$. Dividing both sides by $2$ results in $x = -\\frac{5}{2}$. \n\nFor the second equation, we can start by subtracting $2z$ from both sides, but we need to express $2z$ in terms of $x$ and $z$ if needed.\nFor the second equation, subtracting $2z$ from both sides gives $-2x + 1 = -6x + 10$. Adding $6x$ to both sides and subtracting $1$ from both sides results in $4x = 9 - 2z$. \n\nHowever, we need to express $x$ in terms of $z$ from this equation as well as the value of $x$ we obtained from the first equation. We know that $x = -\\frac{5}{2}$, and we can substitute this value into the equation $4x = 9 - 2z$ to solve for $z$.\nSubstitute the value of $x$ into the equation $4x = 9 - 2z$ to solve for $z$:\n\\[ 4\\left(-\\frac{5}{2}\\right) = 9 - 2z \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ -10 = 9 - 2z \\]\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n\\[ -19 = -2z \\]\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\\[ z = \\frac{19}{2} \\]\nNow that we have the value of $z$, we can substitute it back into one of the equations to verify our results.
