This occurs when $\\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi$, where $n$ is an integer.\nTo find the number of $x$-intercepts, we need to determine the number of integer values of $n$ such that $0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001$.

The greatest integer less than $314.16$ is $314$, so the number of integers in this range is $1000 - 314 = 686$.\nThe next step is to recognize that the calculated number represents the total number of $x$-intercepts, and it already reflects the complete count of integer values of $n$ within the specified interval.\nThe calculated number of 686 represents the total number of $x$-intercepts, and it already reflects the complete count of integer values of $n$ within the specified interval.\n\n$\\boxed{686}$",
