Let the equation of the plane be $ax + by + cz + d = 0$. \n\nThe distance from a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ to a plane $ax + by + cz + d = 0$ is given by $\\frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0 + d|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}$. \n\nSince the cube's side length is 10, and the three adjacent vertices are at heights 10, 11, and 12, the point $A$ must be at a distance of 10, 11, or 12 from the plane along the line connecting it to the plane.\nThe next step is to parameterize the line passing through $A$ and perpendicular to the plane, and express the equation of the plane in terms of the parameter. Let $A$ be $(0,0,0)$ and the plane be parameterized as $x = 0, y = 0, z = t$, where $t$ is the parameter. Since we know the three adjacent vertices, we can write the equation of the plane as $ax + by + cz + d = 0$.

We can plug in the known values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ to obtain a system of equations.\nWe plug in the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ for the three adjacent vertices into the equation $ax + by + dz = -d$. We get the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n10a &= -d_1 \\\\\n10b &= -d_2 \\\\\n10c &= -d_3 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere $d_1$, $d_2$, and $d_3$ are constants. Then, we can set $d$ as $d = 10(d_1/a) = 10(d_2/b) = 10(d_3/c)$.\nThe next step is to express the equation of the plane in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$. Using the fact that $d = 10(d_1/a) = 10(d_2/b) = 10(d_3/c)$, we can write the equation of the plane as $ax + by + cz + 10(d_1/a)x + 10(d_2/b)y + 10(d_3/c)z = 0$. Simplifying this equation, we get $(ad_1 + 10a)x + (ad_2 + 10b)y + (ad_3 + 10c)z = 0$.\n\nWe can further simplify the equation to $a(dx + 10) + b(dy + 10) + c(dz + 10) = 0$. Since this equation must be true for all points on the plane, we can equate it to the original equation of the plane, $ax + by + cz + d = 0$, to obtain $d = -10$. Substituting this value of $d$ into the equation of the plane, we get $ax + by + cz - 10 = 0\nThe next step is to use the equation of the plane $ax + by + cz - 10 = 0$ to find the distance from point $A(0,0,0)$ to the plane, and compare it with the distances from the three adjacent vertices to the plane to determine the value of $t$ in the expression $\\frac{r-\\sqrt{s}}{t}$. \n\nTo find the distance from point $A(0,0,0)$ to the plane, we can use the formula for the distance from a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ to a plane $ax + by + cz + d = 0$, which is $\\frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0 + d|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}$. \n\nThe distance from point $A$ to the plane is $\\frac{|-10|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}$. \n\nWe also know that the three adjacent vertices are at heights 10, 11, and\nThe next step is to use the fact that the distance from vertex $A$ to the plane is less than the distances from the three adjacent vertices to the plane. This means that $\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} < 10, \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} < 11, \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} < 12$. We can simplify these inequalities to $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} < 10, \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} < 10\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} < 20/3$.\nWe need to find values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy the inequalities $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} < 10, \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} < 10\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} < 20/3$.\nThe next step is to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy the inequalities $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} < 10, \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} < 10\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} < 20/3$. We can try various combinations of $a$, $b$, and $c$ to satisfy these inequalities. After some trial and error, we find that $(a,b,c) = (1,1,6)$ satisfies the inequalities. This means that the equation of the plane is $x + y + 6z - 10 = 0$.\nNow, we can find the distance from vertex $A$ to the plane using the formula for the distance from a point to a plane. The distance is $\\frac{|-10|}{\\sqrt{1 + 1 + 36}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{38}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2}(1 + \\sqrt{19})}$. Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{19} + \\sqrt{2}}$. Rationalizing the denominator, we have $\\frac{5(\\sqrt{19} - \\sqrt{2})}{19-2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{19}-5\\sqrt{2}}{17}$. Therefore, $r=5\\sqrt{19}$, $s= 5^2(19)+ 2^2(5)= 300+50=350$, and $t= 17$.\nNow, we can find the sum of $r$, $s$, and $t$ to determine the final answer. We have $r = 5\\sqrt{19}$, $s = 350$, and $t = 17$. The sum is $r + s + t = 5\\sqrt{19} + 350 + 17$. Since we need to find integers $r$, $s$, and $t$ such that $r+s+t < 1000$, we can approximate $5\\sqrt{19}$ to be 27.32, which means $5\\sqrt{19}$ is approximately 28. To find an exact expression for $r$, we simplify $5\\sqrt{19}$ to be $\\sqrt{25 \\times 19}$ and then to be $\\sqrt{25} \\times \\sqrt{19}$ and then to be 5$\\sqrt{19}$ which can be rewritten as $\\sqrt{5^2 \\times 19}$ and is equal to 5$\\sqrt{19}$. The sum of the three integers is $28 + 350 + 17 = 395$.",
