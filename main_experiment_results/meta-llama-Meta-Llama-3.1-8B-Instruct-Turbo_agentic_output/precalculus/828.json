To find the angle between the vectors $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, we will use the fact that the dot product of two vectors is symmetric, i.e., $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = -(-\\mathbf{a}) \\cdot \\mathbf{b}$.\n\nWe will start by finding the angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ using the given information: $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}}{|\\mathbf{a}| |\\mathbf{b}|}$ where $\\theta = 43^\\circ$.\nSecond step: Since we know that $\\cos\\theta = \\cos(180^\\circ - \\theta)$ for any angle $\\theta$, we can find the cosine of the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ by using the fact that the cosine of the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the negative of the cosine of the angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$.\nThird step: Since $\\cos\\theta = \\cos(180^\\circ - \\theta)$ for any angle $\\theta$, it follows that $\\cos\\theta = -\\cos\\theta$ for $\\theta = 43^\\circ$. This means that the cosine of the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the negative of the cosine of the angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$. Therefore, $\\cos\\phi = -\\cos43^\\circ$ where $\\phi$ is the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$.\nFourth step: To find the angle $\\phi$ between the vectors $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, we need to find the arccosine (inverse cosine) of $-\\cos43^\\circ$. This is because the cosine of an angle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle, and the cosine function is negative in the second and third quadrants where the angle between the vectors $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ lies.\nFifth step: To find the angle $\\phi$, we use the fact that the cosine function is positive in the first quadrant. Since the cosine of an angle in the second quadrant is positive, the angle between the vectors $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the supplement of the angle between the vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $-\\mathbf{b}$.
