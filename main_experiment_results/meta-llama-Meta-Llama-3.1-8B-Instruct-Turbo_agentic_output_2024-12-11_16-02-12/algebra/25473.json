    "problem": "Joann rode her bike at an average speed of 12 miles per hour for three and a half hours. If her friend, Fran, rides for 3 hours, at what average speed, in miles per hour, would she have to ride her bike to travel the same distance that Joann traveled?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "In $3\\frac{1}{2}$ hours, Joann covers $\\left(3\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ hours}\\right)(12\\text{ mph})=42$ miles.  If Fran's average speed in miles per hour is $s$, then Fran covers $3s$ miles in $3$ hours.  Solving $3s=42$ we find $s=\\boxed{14}$ miles per hour.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the distance Joann traveled. The formula to find distance is:\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSince Joann rode her bike at an average speed of 12 miles per hour for 3.5 hours, we can plug in the values:\n\nDistance = 12 miles/hour \u00d7 3.5 hours\n\nWe will calculate this in the next step.\nTo find the distance Joann traveled, we need to multiply her speed by the time she rode her bike. \n\nDistance = 12 miles/hour \u00d7 3.5 hours\nDistance = 42 miles\n\nSo, Joann traveled 42 miles.\n\nNow, we know Fran needs to travel the same distance, which is 42 miles, but she has only 3 hours to do it. To find her required speed, we can use the formula:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nWe know the distance (42 miles) and the time (3 hours), so we can plug in the values:\n\nSpeed = 42 miles / 3 hours\nSpeed = 14 miles/hour\n\nTherefore, Fran would have to ride her bike at an average speed of 14 miles per hour to travel the same distance Joann traveled.\nNow that we have the required speed for Fran, we can conclude our solution.\n\nThe distance Joann traveled is 42 miles. \nSince Fran has to travel the same distance in 3 hours, her required speed is 14 miles per hour.\n\n$\\boxed{14}$",
