    "problem": "Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles. If it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles, using the same rates, how many minutes would it take Jordan to run 5 miles?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since Steve's 3-mile time is 24 minutes, Jordan ran 2 miles in $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot24=12$ minutes.  Therefore, each mile takes Jordan 6 minutes to run, so he would take $6\\cdot5=\\boxed{30}$ minutes to run five miles.",

    "model_solution": "First step:\nSince Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles, and Steve ran 3 miles in 24 minutes, we can find out the time it took Jordan to run 2 miles. \n\nLet's find the time it took Jordan to run 2 miles. Since Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles, half the time Steve ran 3 miles is 24 / 2 = 12 minutes.\nFirst step:\nSince Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles, and Steve ran 3 miles in 24 minutes, we can find out the time it took Jordan to run 2 miles. \n\nLet's find the time it took Jordan to run 2 miles. Since Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles, half the time Steve ran 3 miles is 24 / 2 = 12 minutes.\n\nSecond step:\nSince Jordan ran 2 miles in 12 minutes, his rate can be calculated as 2 miles / 12 minutes = 1/6 miles per minute.\n\nThird step:\nTo find out how many minutes it would take Jordan to run 5 miles, divide 5 miles by his rate. \n\nTime = distance / rate \nTime = 5 / (1/6) = 5 x 6 = 30 minutes\n\nSo, it would take Jordan 30 minutes to run 5 miles.\nSince you've already solved the problem, here's the final step:\n\nIt would take Jordan $\\boxed{30}$ minutes to run 5 miles.",
