    "solution": "In order for the four lines to enclose a rectangular region, we must choose two horizontal and two vertical lines.  If we were to choose more than two of one of these types of lines, we would not be able to enclose any region.  We can count independently the number of ways to choose vertical and horizontal lines.  There will be $\\dbinom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose horizontal lines, and the same number of ways to choose two vertical lines.

    "model_solution": "To form a rectangle, we need two horizontal and two vertical lines. \n\nLet's consider the ways to choose two horizontal lines out of four. This can be done in 6 ways:\n\n1. All four lines are chosen.\n2. Any three of the four lines are chosen.\n3. Any two of the four lines are chosen.\n4. Only one of the four lines is chosen.\n5. None of the four lines are chosen.\n\nFor each of the above ways of choosing the horizontal lines, we can choose two of the four vertical lines in 6 ways.\n\nHowever, the above five ways do not consider that a rectangle must be formed with two horizontal and two vertical lines. We need to choose two horizontal and two vertical lines.\n\nTo choose the two horizontal lines, we can use combinations (denoted as C(n, k)), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. The formula for combinations is n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n! is the factorial of n.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose two horizontal lines is C(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 6.\n\nNow\nTo choose two horizontal lines, we can use combinations. The number of ways to choose two horizontal lines out of four is C(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 4! / (2!2!) = (4*3)/(2*1) = 6.\n\nTo choose two vertical lines out of four, we can also use combinations. The number of ways to choose two vertical lines out of four is C(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 4! / (2!2!) = (4*3)/(2*1) = 6.\n\nSince we need to choose two horizontal and two vertical lines, the total number of ways to form a rectangle is the product of the number of ways to choose two horizontal lines and the number of ways to choose two vertical lines. \n\nSo, the total number of ways is 6 * 6 = 36.\n\nBut this is not the final answer. We need to consider that not all combinations of two horizontal and two vertical lines will form a rectangle.
