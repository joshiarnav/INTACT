    "solution": "Listing the first 10 multiples of 7, which are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, we see that the only positive multiples of 7 that end in 3 are those that are the product of 7 and a number that ends in 9.  Therefore, the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3 are $7\\cdot 9 = 63$, $7\\cdot 19= 133$, $7\\cdot 29 = 203$, . . .  Notice that we can get from each to the next by adding $7\\cdot 10 = 70$, so our multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 are 63, 133, 203, . . ., 903, 973.  The last one is 910 more than the first. Since $910/70=13$, we see that we have taken 13 steps of 70 to get from the first number in the list to the last. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{14}$ numbers in the list.",

We'll begin by examining the possible values of $k$.\nTo find the possible values of $k$ such that $7k$ is less than 1000 and has the form $10n+3$, we can start by rewriting the equation $7k = 10n + 3$ as $7k - 3 = 10n$.\n\nThis implies that $7k - 3$ is a multiple of 10, which means that $7k - 3$ must be a multiple of both 2 and 5.\n\nSince $7k - 3$ is a multiple of 2, the possible values of $k$ can be expressed as $k = 2p + 1$ for some integer $p$, because $k$ must be odd to satisfy the condition that $7k - 3$ is a multiple of 2.\n\nNow, we substitute $k = 2p + 1$ into the equation $7k - 3$ to get:\n\n$7(2p + 1) - 3 = 14p + 7 - 3 = 14p + 4$\n\nThis implies that $14p + 4$ must be a multiple of 10.\n\nNext, we can rewrite $\nTo make $14p + 4$ a multiple of 10, we need to make it a multiple of both 2 and 5.\n\nIt's easy to see that $14p + 4$ is already a multiple of 2 since $14p$ is even and adding 4 makes it even.\n\nTo make $14p + 4$ a multiple of 5, we need to make $14p + 4$ end with 0 or 5.\n\nSince $14p + 4$ ends with 4, we want to make it end with 5.\n\nSo, we need to find a number that when multiplied by 14 and added to 4, the result ends with 5.\n\nWe can try values of $p$ to find the first few multiples of 14 that end with 5.\n\nSince $14 \\cdot 1 = 14$ and $14 + 4 = 18$ (ends with 8), and $14 \\cdot 2 = 28$ and $28 + 4 = 32$ (ends with 2), we try $p = 3$.\n\n$14 \\cdot 3 = 42$ and $42 +\nNow, let's continue with the next step:\n\nWe want to find a value of $p$ such that $14p + 4$ ends with 5. \n\nWe tried $p = 3$ and got $14p + 4 = 14 \\cdot 3 + 4 = 42 + 4 = 46$, which is not what we want.\n\nNext, we try $p = 4$. \n\n$14 \\cdot 4 = 56$ and $56 + 4 = 60$, which ends with 0, not 5.
