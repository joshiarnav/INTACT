    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2. There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum IS even is $1-\\frac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",

To do this, we'll calculate the total number of possible pairs.\nTo find the total number of possible pairs, we will use the combination formula:\n\nTotal number of possible pairs = nC2 (where n is the total number of prime numbers)\n= (7 * 6) / 2\n= (42) / 2\n= 21\n\nNow, let's find the pairs that sum to an even number. We can do this by considering the two cases:\n\n1. Both numbers are even, or\n2. Both numbers are odd.\n\nSince there is only one even prime number (2), we cannot have two even prime numbers in our pair. So, we will only consider pairs of odd prime numbers.\n\nPairs of odd prime numbers = 6C2 (where 6 is the total number of odd prime numbers)\n= (6 * 5) / 2\n= (30) / 2\n= 15\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of pairs where both numbers are not both odd (i.e., one of them is even). Since there is only one even prime number, we can have the following combinations:\n\n- Even prime number and one of the odd prime numbers: 1C1 * 6C1 = (1 * 6\nTo find the total number of pairs where both numbers are not both odd (i.e., one of them is even), we will calculate the combinations:\n\n- Even prime number and one of the odd prime numbers: 1C1 * 6C1 \n= (1 * 6) \n= 1 * (6 * 1) / 2\n= 6 / 2\n= 3\n\nNow, we have the total number of pairs where the sum is an even number (15) and the total number of pairs where both numbers are not both odd (3). However, these two cases are mutually exclusive (i.e., they cannot happen at the same time), and the sum of the probabilities of these two cases will give us the total probability of the sum being even. \n\nBut we need to find the total number of pairs first. The total number of pairs is 21. \n\nThe total number of pairs where the sum is an even number is 15. The total number of pairs where both numbers are not both odd (i.e., one of them is even) is 3.

We also know that these pairs are a result of one odd number and one even number. \n\nWe calculated earlier that the total number of pairs where both numbers are not both odd (i.e., one of them is even) is 3. However, this is the number of pairs that have an even number. We need the number of pairs with an odd number. However, the odd prime is paired with the even prime. Pairs of odd prime numbers = 6C2 = 15.

We want to find the total number of pairs where the sum is an even number, considering both cases:\n\n1. Both numbers are even, or\n2. Both numbers are odd.\n\nSince there is only one even prime number (2), we cannot have two even prime numbers in our pair. So, we will only consider pairs of odd prime numbers, which we calculated earlier as 15.\n\nTo find the total number of pairs where the sum is an even number, we need to add the number of pairs where both numbers are even (which is 0, since there is only one even prime number) and the number of pairs where both numbers are odd (which is 15).\n\nTotal number of pairs where the sum is an\nTo find the total number of pairs where the sum is an even number, we have two cases:\n\n1. Both numbers are even: This is not possible since there is only one even prime number (2), and we need two distinct numbers. So, the number of pairs where both numbers are even is 0.\n\n2. Both numbers are odd: We have already calculated the number of pairs where both numbers are odd as 15.\n\nSince these two cases are mutually exclusive, we can simply add the number of pairs in each case to get the total number of pairs where the sum is an even number:\n\nTotal number of pairs where the sum is an even number = 0 (since there are no pairs where both numbers are even) + 15 (since there are 15 pairs where both numbers are odd)\n= 15\n\nNow, we have the total number of pairs where the sum is an even number (15) and the total number of pairs (21).
