    "solution": "The only three digit numbers which are ruled out are numbers of the form $ABA$, where A and B are different digits. There are 9 ways to choose A, since it can't be 0, and once A has been chosen there are 9 ways to choose B. Since there are $9\\cdot10\\cdot10=900$ total three digit numbers, and $9\\cdot9=81$ numbers which aren't valid, there are $900-81=\\boxed{819}$ valid numbers.",

any digit from 1 to 9 (since a three-digit number must start with a non-zero digit), and the second and third digits can be any digit from 0 to 9. \n\nThe total number of three-digit numbers = (number of possibilities for the first digit) * (number of possibilities for the second digit) * (number of possibilities for the third digit)\n\n= 9 * 10 * 10\n= 900\n\nSo, there are 900 three-digit numbers in total.\nTo find the total number of three-digit numbers that have exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent, let's break it down into cases.\n\n### Case 1: First and last digit are the same\nIn this case, the first and last digits are the same, and the second digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, except the one that is the same as the first and last digit.\n\nThe number of possibilities for the first and last digit (which are the same) = 9 (since the first digit can be any digit from 1 to 9, and the last digit must be the same as the first digit)\n\nThe number of possibilities for the second digit = 9 (since it can be any digit from 0 to 9, except the one that is the same as the first and last digit)\n\nSo, the total number of three-digit numbers in which the first and last digit are the same = 9 * 9 = 81\n\n### Case 2: Middle and last digit are the same\nIn this case, the middle and last digits are the same, and the first digit can be any digit from 1 to 9, except the one that is\nTo find the total number of three-digit numbers that have exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent, let's analyze the rest of the cases.\n\n### Case 2: Middle and last digit are the same\nIn this case, the middle and last digits are the same, and the first digit can be any digit from 1 to 9, except the one that is the same as the middle and last digit.\n\nThe number of possibilities for the first digit = 9 (since it can be any digit from 1 to 9)\n\nThe number of possibilities for the middle and last digit (which are the same) = 9 (since the last digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, and the middle digit must be the same as the last digit)\n\nSo, the total number of three-digit numbers in which the middle and last digit are the same = 9 * 9 = 81\n\n### Case 3: First and middle digit are the same\nIn this case, the first and middle digits are the same, and the last digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, except the one that is the same as the first and middle digit.\n\nThe number of possibilities\nTo find the total number of three-digit numbers that have exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent, let's continue with Case 3:\n\n### Case 3: First and middle digit are the same\nIn this case, the first and middle digits are the same, and the last digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, except the one that is the same as the first and middle digit.\n\nThe number of possibilities for the first and middle digit (which are the same) = 9 (since the first digit can be any digit from 1 to 9, and the middle digit must be the same as the first digit)\n\nThe number of possibilities for the last digit = 9 (since it can be any digit from 0 to 9, except the one that is the same as the first and middle digit)\n\nSo, the total number of three-digit numbers in which the first and middle digit are the same = 9 * 9 = 81\n\nNow, let's add up the total number of three-digit numbers in each case:\n\nTotal number of three-digit numbers with exactly two digits the same, but not adjacent = \nCase 1: 81\nCase 2:\n### Case 2: Middle and last digit are the same\nIn this case, the middle and last digits are the same, and the first digit can be any digit from 1 to 9, except the one that is the same as the middle and last digit.\n\nThe number of possibilities for the first digit = 9 (since it can be any digit from 1 to 9)\n\nThe number of possibilities for the middle and last digit (which are the same) = 9 (since the last digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, and the middle digit must be the same as the last digit)\n\nSo, the total number of three-digit numbers in which the middle and last digit are the same = 9 * 9 = 81\n\n### Case 3: First and middle digit are the same\nIn this case, the first and middle digits are the same, and the last digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, except the one that is the same as the first and middle digit.\n\nThe number of possibilities for the first and middle

of three-digit numbers with exactly two digits the same, but not adjacent\nNow, let's add up the total number of three-digit numbers in each case:\n\nCase 1: 81\nCase 2: 81\nCase 3: 81\n\nTotal number of three-digit numbers with exactly two digits the same, but not adjacent = 81 + 81 +\n### Case 3: First and middle digit are the same\nIn this case, the first and middle digits are the same, and the
