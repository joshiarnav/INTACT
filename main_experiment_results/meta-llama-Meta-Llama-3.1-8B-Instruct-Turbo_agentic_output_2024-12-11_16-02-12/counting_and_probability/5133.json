    "problem": "How many 10-digit positive integers have all digits either 1 or 2, and have two consecutive 1's?\n",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We take as our universe the set of 10-digit integers whose digits are all either 1 or 2, of which there are $2^{10}$, and we count the complement. The complement is the set of 10-digit positive integers composed of the digits 1 and 2 with no two consecutive 1s. Counting such numbers is a popular combinatorial problem: we approach it via a recursion.\nThere are two \"good\" one-digit numbers (1 and 2) and three good two-digit numbers (12, 21 and 22). Each such $n$-digit number is formed either by gluing \"2\" on to the end of a good $(n - 1)$-digit number or by gluing \"21\" onto the end of a good $(n - 2)$-digit number. This is a bijection between the good $n$-digit numbers and the union of the good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. Thus, the number of good $n$-digit numbers is the sum of the number of good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. The resulting recursion is exactly that of the Fibonacci numbers with initial values $F_1 = 2$ and $F_2 = 3$.\nThus, our final answer is $2^{10} - F_{10} = 1024 - 144 = \\boxed{880}$.",

This can be thought of as a string of n-2 digits with no consecutive 1's, with a 2 added at the end (this corresponds to $a_{n-2}$) and another digit (1) added at the end. \n\nThus, we have a recursive relation $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2\nTo solve the recursive relation $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$, we can use the fact that $a_1 = 2$ (since there are 2 possible 1-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2) and $a_2 = 3$ (since there are 3 possible 2-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2 and no consecutive 1's: 22, 12, and 21).\n\nNow, we can find the values of $a_3, a_4, a_5, ...$ using the recursive relation.\n\n$a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 3 + 2 = 5$\n$a_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 5 + 3 = 8$\n$a_5 = a_4 + a_3 = 8 + 5 = 13$\n$a_6 = a_5 + a_4 = 13 + 8 = 21$\n$a_7 = a_6 + a_5 = 21 + 13 = 34$\n$a_8 = a_7 + a_6\nLet's continue to find the values of $a_9$ and $a_{10}$.\n\n$a_9 = a_8 + a_7 = 89 + 34 = 123$\n$a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 = 123 + 89 = 212$\n\nThe total number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2 is 1024.
