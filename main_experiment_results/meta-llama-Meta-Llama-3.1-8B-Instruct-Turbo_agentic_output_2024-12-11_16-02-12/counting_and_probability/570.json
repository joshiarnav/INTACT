    "problem": "If Greg rolls four fair six-sided dice, what is the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We notice that the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's must equal the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's. So, we can find the probability that Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's, subtract it from 1, and divide by 2 to find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's. There are three ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's: he can roll two of each, one of each, or none of each. If he rolls two of each, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which two dice roll the 1's. If he rolls one of each, there are $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1}=12$ ways to choose which dice are the 6 and the 1, and for each of those ways there are $4\\cdot4=16$ ways to choose the values of the other dice. If Greg rolls no 1's or 6's, there are $4^4=256$ possible values for the dice. In total, there are $6+12\\cdot16+256=454$ ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's. There are $6^4=1296$ total ways the four dice can roll, so the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\left(1-\\dfrac{454}{1296}\\right)=\\boxed{\\dfrac{421}{1296}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of complementary probability, which means finding the probability of the opposite event and subtracting it from 1.\n\nThe opposite event of \"Greg rolls more 1's than 6's\" is \"Greg rolls as many 1's as 6's or more 6's than 1's\". \n\nHowever, there's an easier approach: instead of considering the opposite event, we can consider the cases where Greg rolls more 1's than 6's as the total number of 1's and 6's. So there are three scenarios where Greg rolls more 1's than 6's: \n- He rolls more 1's than 6's, exactly 2 of each, or more 6's than 1's.\n\nStep 2 will consider these three scenarios.\nTo find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's, we will break it down into three cases.\n\n**Case 1: Greg rolls more 1's than 6's**\n\nIn this case, the number of 1's is n+1, and the number of 6's is n for some integer n. The number of ways to roll this is ${4\\choose n+1}{4-n-1\\choose n}6^{n+1}4^n$. The total number of possible outcomes is $6^4$. So, the probability of this case is:\n\n$${4\\choose n+1}{4-n-1\\choose n}6^{n+1}4^n \\cdot \\frac{1}{6^4} = \\frac{{4\\choose n+1}{4-n-1\\choose n}4^n}{6^3}$$\n\n**Case 2: Greg rolls exactly 2 1's and 2 6's.**\n\nIn this case, the number of 1's is 2, and the number of 6's is 2. So, the two remaining dice must be something other than 1 or 6\n**Case 2: Greg rolls exactly 2 1's and 2 6's.**\n\nIn this case, the number of 1's is 2, and the number of 6's is 2. We need to find the number of ways to roll this and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nTo roll exactly 2 1's and 2 6's, we can choose 2 of the 4 dice to be 1's in ${4\\choose 2}$ ways. The remaining 2 dice must be 6's. The number of ways to roll the two remaining dice as something other than 1 or 6 is $4^2$ (each die has 4 ways to roll: 2, 3, 4, or 5).\n\nSo, the number of ways to roll exactly 2 1's and 2 6's is ${4\\choose 2}4^2 = 6 \\cdot 16 = 96$.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is $6^4$. So, the probability of this case is:\n\n$$\\frac{96}{6^4} = \\frac{96}{1296}\n**Case 3: Greg rolls more 6's than 1's**\n\nIn this case, the number of 1's is n for some integer n, and the number of 6's is n+1. The number of ways to roll this is ${4\\choose n} 4^n {4-n-1\\choose n+1} 6^{n+1}$. \n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is $6^4$. So, the probability of this case is:\n\n$${4\\choose n} 4^n {4-n-1\\choose n+1} 6^{n+1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6^4} = \\frac{{4\\choose n} 4^n {4-n-1\\choose n+1} 4}{6^3}$$\n\nTo find the total probability of Greg rolling more 1's than 6's, we need to sum the probabilities of the three cases.\n\nLet's denote the sum of the probabilities as P.
