    "problem": "If I have a $4\\times 4$ chess board, in how many ways can I place four distinct pawns on the board such that each column and row of the board contains no more than one pawn?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Because our chess board is $4 \\times 4$, there must be exactly one pawn in each column and each row. Consider the ways to place one pawn in each row. In the first row, there are four potential spots for a pawn. However, no matter where we place the pawn, it takes up one column. So, in the second row, there are only three potential spots for a pawn. Similarly, there are two spots in the third row and only one in the fourth. Thus, there are $4\\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 24$ ways in which we can place the pawns. Now, because each pawn is distinct, we have four possible pawns to place in the first slot, three in the second, two in the fourth, and one in the last. So there are $24$ possible orderings of the pawns. Our final answer is thus $24^2 = \\boxed{576}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can think of it as a permutation problem since the order of placement matters.\n\nFor the first pawn, there are 16 possible locations (4 rows x 4 columns) to choose from. This is our starting point.\n\nNow, let's break it down into a step-by-step solution:\n\nStep 1: \nThere are 16 possible locations for the first pawn.\n\nWe can represent this as 16.\n\nNow, we need to proceed with the next step to determine the possible locations for the second pawn.\nStep 2:\nFor the second pawn, we need to consider that no row or column can contain more than one pawn. This means that for the second pawn, there are 9 possible locations left. We can subtract 7 from the 16 possible locations of the first pawn, as 7 of the locations are already occupied by the first pawn. However, we can only subtract 7 in this manner because the first pawn could have been placed in any 7 of the 16 possible locations (4 rows * 4 columns - 4 rows - 4 columns = 16 - 8 = 8,  but since it could have been in any of 4 sets of 4 it reduces to 7). \n\nHowever, this is not an accurate way to reason this out. This is a permutation with restrictions problem. For the second pawn, the first row has 3 possible locations (as one location is already taken by the first pawn), the second row has 3 possible locations, the third row has 3 possible locations, and the fourth row has 3 possible locations as well.\n\nHowever, this reasoning also has a problem, in that we are not considering the column restrictions correctly. Let's correct this by considering\nLet's proceed with the next step correctly.\n\nStep 2:\nFor the second pawn, we need to consider the restrictions imposed by both rows and columns. \n\n- In each row, there is only one location available for the second pawn, so it can be placed in any of the 4 rows.\n- However, once a row is chosen, there are only 3 columns available for the second pawn because one column is already occupied by the first pawn. Since there are 4 rows, the total number of ways to place the second pawn is 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nThis reasoning is more accurate, considering the restrictions imposed by both rows and columns.\n\nNow, we need to proceed with the next step to determine the possible locations for the third pawn.\n\nStep 3:\nFor the third pawn, we need to consider the restrictions imposed by both rows and columns.\n\n- In each row, there is only one location available for the third pawn, so it can be placed in any of the 3 remaining rows.\n- However, once a row is chosen, there are only 2 columns available for the third pawn because two columns are already occupied by the first two pawns.

Since there are 4 rows, the total number of ways to place the third pawn is 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the final step to determine the possible locations for the fourth pawn.\n\nStep 4:\nFor the fourth pawn, we need to consider the restrictions imposed by both rows and columns.\n\n- In each row, there is only one location available for the fourth pawn, so it can be placed in any of the 2 remaining rows.\n- However, once a row is chosen, there is only 1 column available for the fourth pawn because three columns are already occupied by the first three pawns. Since there are 4 rows, the total number of ways to place the fourth pawn is 2 * 1 = 2\nNow, let's proceed with the next step to find the total number of ways to place the four distinct pawns on the board.\n\nStep 5:\nWe can multiply the number of ways to place each pawn together to find the total number of ways.\n\nFor the first pawn, there are 16 possible locations.\nFor the second pawn, there are 12 possible locations.\nFor the third pawn, there are 6 possible locations.\nFor the fourth pawn, there are 2 possible locations.\n\nNow, we multiply these numbers together to find the total number of ways: 16 * 12 * 6 * 2.\n\nFirst, let's multiply 16 * 12 = 192.\nThen, let's multiply 192 * 6 = 1152.\nFinally, let's multiply 1152 * 2 = 2304.\n\nSo, there are $\\boxed{2304}$ ways to place four distinct pawns on the board such that each column and row of the board contains no more than one pawn.",
