    "problem": "Seven people arrive to dinner, but the circular table only seats six.  If two seatings such that one is a rotation of the other are considered the same, then in how many different ways can we choose six people and seat them at the table?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing.  To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person.  This suggests that there are $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people.  However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count.  Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table.  There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.",

This is a combination problem, where the order of selection does not matter.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 6 people out of 7 is denoted as \"7 choose 6\" and can be calculated using the formula for combinations:\n\nnCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (7 people), r is the number of items to choose (6 people), and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 6 people out of 7 is:\n\n7C6 = 7! / (6!(7-6)!)\n= 7! / (6!1!)\n= 7\n\nWe can choose 6 people out of 7 in 7 different ways, which is not what we expected. This is because the problem is a little more complex than a simple combination problem.\nStep 2: Arrange the 6 chosen people at the table.\nWe have 7 people, but we only seat 6 of them at the table. The remaining person will be left standing. We need to choose 6 people out of 7, which we already calculated as 7 ways.\n\nNow, we need to arrange the 6 chosen people at the table. There are 6! ways to arrange 6 people in a linear fashion. However, because the table is circular, we need to consider rotations as equivalent arrangements.\n\nImagine we fix one person at a particular position at the table. Now, we can arrange the remaining 5 people in 5! ways. However, if we rotate the table by one position, we get a different arrangement that is considered equivalent.\n\nTo account for this, we need to divide the total number of linear arrangements (6!) by the number of positions at the table (6). This is because each arrangement has 6 equivalent rotations.\n\nSo, the number of unique circular arrangements is:\n\n6! / 6 = 120 / 6\n= 20\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways to choose 6 people out of 7 (7 ways) by the\nTo find the final answer, we multiply the number of ways to choose 6 people out of 7 (7 ways) by the number of unique circular arrangements (20 ways):\n\n7 ways * 20 ways\n= 140 ways\n\nSo, the final answer is: $\\boxed{140}$",
