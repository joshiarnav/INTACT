For the last position, we have only one possibility, which is A.\n\n- Case 6: The word ends with AA, AB, or AC. In this case, we can choose any of the three letters for the first six positions. However, for the last two positions, we have only one possibility for the second position (it must be the letter that comes after the first position), and two possibilities for the first position (it can be A or the letter that comes before the second position).
