    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the set and the problem**\nWe are given a set of integers from 1 to 16. We want to find the number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of this set.\n\nThe key concept here is that any positive integer $n$ can be represented as $x - y$, where $x$ and $y$ are distinct members of the set. Since the set contains consecutive integers, we can use this fact to find the possible differences.\n\nLet's start by finding the maximum possible difference between two members of the set. We know that the maximum value in the set is 16, and the minimum value is 1. So, the maximum possible difference is $16 - 1 = 15$.\n\nSince we are looking for positive integers, we don't need to consider differences that are negative or zero. We will explore the possible differences in the next step.\n**Step 2: Explore the possible differences**\n\nWe know that the maximum possible difference is 15. Now, let's consider how to obtain all possible positive differences between two distinct members of the set.\n\nSince the set contains consecutive integers, we can observe that any difference between two numbers will be a positive integer. The smallest difference will be 1, obtained by subtracting consecutive numbers (e.g., 2 - 1 = 1).\n\nWe can find all possible differences by considering the differences between the members of the set. If we subtract the smallest number (1) from the largest number (16), we get the maximum difference, which is 15.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the differences between other pairs of numbers. For example, if we subtract 2 from 16, we get a difference of 14. If we subtract 3 from 16, we get a difference of 13, and so on.\n\nWe can observe a pattern here. For each number $k$ in the set, the difference between $k$ and 16 will be $16 - k$. This will give us all the possible differences between 1 and 15.\n\nNow, let's count how many different positive integers can be\n**Step 3: Count the number of different positive integers**\n\nWe have found that any positive integer between 1 and 15 can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set. \n\nTo count the number of different positive integers, we can simply count the number of integers between 1 and 15, inclusive.\n\nThe number of integers between 1 and 15, inclusive, is:\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\n\nThere are 15 integers in this list.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{15}$ different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 14, 15, 16 \\}$.",
