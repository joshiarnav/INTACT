    "solution": "Drawing a diagram and adding $OM$ perpendicular to $AD$, we get\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-1,1);\nB=(1,1);\nC=(1,-1);\nD=(-1,-1);\nE=(-1,-.577);\nF=(-1,.577);\nM=(-1,0);\ndraw(circle(O,1.155));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--A);\ndraw(F--O);\ndraw(O--E);\ndraw(O--M);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"F\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, dir(0));\nlabel(\"M\", M, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (F+O)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (E+O)/2, SE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", M, W);\n[/asy] First note that $O$ is not only the center of the circle but also the center of the square since the diagram is symmetric. Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.",

This line bisects the chord, creating two right-angled triangles.\n\nLet's denote the midpoint of the chord as M and the foot of the perpendicular from O to the chord as N. Since the chord is equal in length to the radius, OM is also the radius of the circle, which is r.\n\nWe can now see that triangle OMC is a right-angled triangle with ON as the height and MC as the half chord. The length of MC is half the length of the chord, which is x/2.\n\nSince the length of the chord is equal to the radius, we can write:\n\nx = r\n\nNow, let's look at the right-angled triangle OMC.\n\nWe can apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle OMC to find the relationship between r, x, and ON.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nON^2 + (x/2)^2 = r^2\n\nSubstituting x = r:\n\nON^2 + (r/2)^\nLet's proceed with the problem step-by-step.\n\nWe have the equation:\n\nON^2 + (r/2)^2 = r^2\n\nExpanding the equation:\n\nON^2 + (r^2)/4 = r^2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n4ON^2 + r^2 = 4r^2\n\nSubtracting r^2 from both sides:\n\n4ON^2 = 3r^2\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\n\nON^2 = (3/4)r^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nON = (\u221a(3)/2)r\n\nNow, let's consider triangle ONC.

The area of a square is given by the formula:\n\nArea of square = side length^2\n\nSubstituting x = \u221a(3)r:\n\nArea of square = (\u221a(3)r)^2\n\nExpanding the square:\n\nArea of square = (\u221a(3))^2r^2\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nArea of square = 3r^2\n\nNext, we need to find the area of the circle.
