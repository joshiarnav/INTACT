    "problem": "The radius of a cylinder is doubled and its height is tripled. If its original volume was 10 cubic feet, what is its volume now, in cubic feet?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively.  The new cylinder has volume \\[\n\\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\\pi r^2 h,\n\\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume.  Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.",

Let's assume the original radius is 'r' and the original height is 'h'. So, the original volume V = \u03c0r\u00b2h = 10.\n\nNow, the cylinder's radius is doubled and its height is tripled.
