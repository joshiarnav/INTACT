We know that the perimeter of triangle $ABC$ is 2007 units, and the sides have lengths that are all integer values. \n\nLet's denote the lengths of the sides as $AB=x$, $BC=y$, and $AC=z$, where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are integers. We are also given that $x < y \\leq z$.\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is given by $x + y + z = 2007$. \n\nSince we are looking for the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$, which is $y - x$, we want to minimize the difference between $y$ and $x$. To do this, we need to find the smallest possible values for $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy the given constraints.\n\nThe smallest possible value for $x$ is when $x$ is as close as possible to $z$, but still less than $z$.

This gives us $x + y + z = 668 + 669 + z = 2007$, which simplifies to $z = 670$. \n\nIn this case, we have $y - x = 669 - 668 = 1$.
