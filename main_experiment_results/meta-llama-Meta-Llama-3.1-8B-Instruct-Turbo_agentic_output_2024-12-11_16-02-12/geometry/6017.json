Via parallel sides and alternate interior angles, we see that the opposite triangles are congruent ($\\triangle BPQ \\cong \\triangle DRS$, $\\triangle APS \\cong \\triangle CRQ$). Quickly we realize that $O$ is also the center of the rectangle.\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, we can solve for a side of the rhombus; $PQ = \\sqrt{15^2 + 20^2} = 25$. Since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors, we have that $OP = 15, OQ = 20$. Also, $\\angle POQ = 90^{\\circ}$, so quadrilateral $BPOQ$ is cyclic. By Ptolemy's Theorem, $25 \\cdot OB = 20 \\cdot 15 + 15 \\cdot 20 = 600$.\nBy similar logic, we have $APOS$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. Let $AP = x$, $AS = y$. The Pythagorean Theorem gives us $x^2 + y^2 = 625\\quad \\mathrm{(1)}$. Ptolemy\u2019s Theorem gives us $25 \\cdot OA = 20x + 15y$. Since the diagonals of a rectangle are equal, $OA = \\frac{1}{2}d = OB$, and $20x + 15y = 600\\quad \\mathrm{(2)}$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = 40 - \\frac 43x$. Substituting into $\\mathrm{(1)}$,\n\\begin{eqnarray*}x^2 + \\left(40-\\frac 43x\\right)^2 &=& 625\\\\ 5x^2 - 192x + 1755 &=& 0\\\\ x = \\frac{192 \\pm \\sqrt{192^2 - 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 1755}}{10} &=& 15, \\frac{117}{5}\\end{eqnarray*}\nWe reject $15$ because then everything degenerates into squares, but the condition that $PR \\neq QS$ gives us a contradiction. Thus $x = \\frac{117}{5}$, and backwards solving gives $y = \\frac{44}5$. The perimeter of $ABCD$ is $2\\left(20 + 15 + \\frac{117}{5} + \\frac{44}5\\right) = \\frac{672}{5}$, and $m + n = \\boxed{677}$.",
