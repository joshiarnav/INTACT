            "To simplify the equation, we can start by expanding the equation:\n\n7(12 * 31 - 12 * \u221a(31)) = 24(12 * 31 - 12 * \u221a(31) + 12 * 31 - 12 * \u221a(31))\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n7(12 * 31 - 12 * \u221a(31)) = 24(2 * 12 * 31 - 2 * 12 * \u221a(31))\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation further by dividing both sides by the common factor of 12:\n\n7(31 - \u221a(31)) = 24(2 * 31 - 2 * \u221a(31))\n\nNext, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 4:\n\n(31 - \u221a(31)) = 6(31 - \u221a(31))\n\nNow, we can see that the left-hand side and the right-hand side are equal. However, the right-hand side cannot be equal to the left-hand side for all values of (31 - \u221a(31)). Therefore, we must have made an error earlier.\n\nTo find the area of triangle CDM, we can use the fact that triangles CDM and CAD are similar to",
