            "To find the area of the square ABCD, let's denote the side length of the square as 'x'. \n\nNow, consider that the square's side length x is also the base of the triangle formed by points B, E, and F. Since the total length of BEF is 60, and it's a triangle, we can draw an altitude from point F to side BE. Let's call this altitude 'h'.\n\nSince BE is divided into three equal parts by points E and F, each part has a length of 30. The altitude h and the line segment from F divides the base BE into two smaller segments (one of length 30 and the other of length 60 - 30 = 30). \n\nWe can use the fact that the two smaller triangles are similar to each other and to the larger triangle BEF. Let's use the ratio of the bases of the smaller triangles and the larger triangle to find the length of x. \n\nSince the two smaller triangles have a base of 30 and a hypotenuse of x, and the larger triangle BEF has a base of 60 and a hypotenuse of x, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n(30 / (x / \u221a",
