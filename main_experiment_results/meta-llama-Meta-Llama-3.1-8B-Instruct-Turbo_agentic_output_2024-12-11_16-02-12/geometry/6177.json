    "solution": "There must be four rays emanating from $X$ that intersect the four corners of the square region. Depending on the location of $X$, the number of rays distributed among these four triangular sectors will vary. We start by finding the corner-most point that is $100$-ray partitional (let this point be the bottom-left-most point).\nWe first draw the four rays that intersect the vertices. At this point, the triangular sectors with bases as the sides of the square that the point is closest to both do not have rays dividing their areas. Therefore, their heights are equivalent since their areas are equal. The remaining $96$ rays are divided among the other two triangular sectors, each sector with $48$ rays, thus dividing these two sectors into $49$ triangles of equal areas.\nLet the distance from this corner point to the closest side be $a$ and the side of the square be $s$. From this, we get the equation $\\frac{a\\times s}{2}=\\frac{(s-a)\\times s}{2}\\times\\frac1{49}$. Solve for $a$ to get $a=\\frac s{50}$. Therefore, point $X$ is $\\frac1{50}$ of the side length away from the two sides it is closest to. By moving $X$ $\\frac s{50}$ to the right, we also move one ray from the right sector to the left sector, which determines another $100$-ray partitional point. We can continue moving $X$ right and up to derive the set of points that are $100$-ray partitional.\nIn the end, we get a square grid of points each $\\frac s{50}$ apart from one another. Since this grid ranges from a distance of $\\frac s{50}$ from one side to $\\frac{49s}{50}$ from the same side, we have a $49\\times49$ grid, a total of $2401$ $100$-ray partitional points. To find the overlap from the $60$-ray partitional, we must find the distance from the corner-most $60$-ray partitional point to the sides closest to it. Since the $100$-ray partitional points form a $49\\times49$ grid, each point $\\frac s{50}$ apart from each other, we can deduce that the $60$-ray partitional points form a $29\\times29$ grid, each point $\\frac s{30}$ apart from each other. To find the overlap points, we must find the common divisors of $30$ and $50$ which are $1, 2, 5,$ and $10$. Therefore, the overlapping points will form grids with points $s$, $\\frac s{2}$, $\\frac s{5}$, and $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other respectively. Since the grid with points $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other includes the other points, we can disregard the other grids. The total overlapping set of points is a $9\\times9$ grid, which has $81$ points. Subtract $81$ from $2401$ to get $2401-81=\\boxed{2320}$.",

Let the four rays emanating from $X$ intersect the boundary of the square at points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. We can also draw the $n$ rays emanating from $X$ and intersecting the boundary of the square at points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and other points that we will label as $E$, $F$, $G$, and so on.\n\nFrom this diagram, we can see that the area of each triangle formed by the rays is equal to the total area of the square divided by $n$.

The point can be anywhere between $\\frac{1}{50}$ and $1$, because the rays can be anywhere between the sides of the square and the point itself.\n\nWe can also plug in $n = 60$ to get:\n\n$$x = \\frac{2}{60} +\nTo find the number of $100$-ray partitional points that are not $60$-ray partitional, we need to find the number of $100$-ray partitional points and subtract the number of $60$-ray partitional points.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of $100$-ray partitional points. Since the $x$ value for a $100$-ray partitional point is between $\\frac{1}{50}$ and $1$, we can find the number of $100$-ray partitional points by finding the number of points in this range.\n\nTo do this, we can consider the unit square as a Cartesian coordinate system, with the $x$-axis running along the bottom of the square and the $y$-axis running along the left side of the square. We can then consider the $x$ value as the $x$-coordinate of the point.\n\nSince the $x$ value is between $\\frac{1}{50}$ and $1$, we can find the number of points in this range by finding the number of integer $x$-coordinates between $2$ and $50$.\n\nThe number of integer $x$-coordinates between $2\nThe number of integer $x$-coordinates between $2$ and $50$ is $50-2+1=49$. However, we need to consider the case where $x=1$, which is a special case where the rays emanating from the point intersect at a single point on the boundary of the square.\n\nSince this case doesn't divide the square into $100$ triangles of equal area, we need to exclude it from the count of $100$-ray partitional points.\n\nTherefore, the number of $100$-ray partitional points is $49$.\n\nNow, let's find the number of $60$-ray partitional points. Since the $x$ value for a $60$-ray partitional point is between $\\frac{1}{30}$ and $1$, we can find the number of $60$-ray partitional points by finding the number of integer $x$-coordinates between $1$ and $30$.\n\nThe number of integer $x$-coordinates between $1$ and $30$ is $30-1+1=30$.

Since $x$ is a continuous variable, we can consider the number of points in the range $\\frac{1}{30} < x \\leq 1$.\n\nSince the range $\\frac{1}{30} < x \\leq 1$ corresponds to the unit interval with length $1 - \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{29}{30}$, we can find the number of integer $x$-coordinates in this range by multiplying the length of the interval by the number of integer $x$-coordinates in the unit interval.\nSince there are $30$ integer $x$-coordinates in the unit interval, we can multiply the length of the interval by the number of integer $x$-coordinates in the unit interval to find the number of integer $x$-coordinates in the range $\\frac{1}{30} < x \\leq 1$:\n\n$$\\frac{29}{30} \\cdot 30 = 29$$\n\nHowever, we need to add $1$ to include the point where $x=1$ is not equal to $1$, but $x=\\frac{1}{30}$ is a point where the rays intersect the boundary of the square at a point. However, we need to exclude this special case since the rays do not divide the square into $60$ triangles of equal area when $x=\\frac{1}{30}$. \n\nBut we are not done yet. We need to divide by $2$ because a point in the region is the same as a point in the region reflected over the line $x=\\frac{1}{2}$ or the line $y=\\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nTherefore, the number of $60$-ray partitional points is $\\frac{29\nTo find the number of $100$-ray partitional points that are not $60$-ray partitional, we need to subtract the number of $60$-ray partitional points from the number of $100$-ray partitional points.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of $100$-ray partitional points and $60$-ray partitional points.
