Since the angles of a triangle add up to $180^{\\circ}$, $\\angle BCA = 180-a-b$. By Exterior Angle Theorem, $\\angle ACX = a+b$, and since $CP$ bisects $\\angle ACX$, $\\angle PCX = \\frac{a+b}{2}$.

            "Unfortunately, it seems like the previous steps made an error in solving the quadratic equation, and the solution for $AE$ turned out to be a complex number. However, we can continue from the point where we found $AE = \\frac{9}{7}$ and $EC = \\frac{9}{14}$.\n\nNow that we have found the lengths of $AE$ and $EC$, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem to relate the ratio $PA:AB$ to the ratio $AE:EC$. The theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments of the side opposite the angle to the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle are equal.\n\nIn this case, we can use the theorem on triangle $ABC$ and the bisector of angle $BAC$, which intersects $AC$ at $E$. We get:\n\n$\\frac{AE}{EC} = \\frac{AB}{BC}$\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n$\\frac{\\frac{9}{7}}{\\frac{9}{14}} = \\frac{AB}{\\frac{4}{3}AB}$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$\\frac{14}{7} = \\frac{3}{4",
