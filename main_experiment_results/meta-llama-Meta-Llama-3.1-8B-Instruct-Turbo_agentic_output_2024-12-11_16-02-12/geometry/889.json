This tells us that $Z$ is the midpoint of $AB$ and $W$ is the midpoint of $CD$. The area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is 120 square units.\n\nThe height of the trapezoid is $ZW$, and the bases are $CD$ and $ZW$.\nSince $Z$ and $W$ are midpoints of $AB$ and $CD$ respectively, we know that $ZW$ is parallel to $AB$ and $CD$, and $ZW$ is half of $AB$ or $CD$.\n\nNow, let's find the height of the trapezoid. Since the area of the trapezoid is 120 square units and one of its bases is half of $AB$ which is $6$ units, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid:\n\n$A = (h/2)(b_1 + b_2)$\n\nwhere $A$ is the area, $h$ is the height, and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the bases.\n\nWe know that the area is 120 square units and one of the bases is 6 units.

The height of the rectangle $ABCD$ is 20 units, and the height of the trapezoid is 13.33 units.
