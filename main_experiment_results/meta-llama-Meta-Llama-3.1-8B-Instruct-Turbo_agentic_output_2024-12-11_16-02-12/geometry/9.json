    "problem": "A round pizza is $\\frac13$ of an inch thick and has a diameter of 12 inches. It is cut into 12 congruent pieces. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one piece? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The entire pizza has radius 6 inches and volume $\\pi (6^2)(1/3) = 12\\pi$ cubic inches.  One slice has 1/12th this volume, or $\\boxed{\\pi}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of one slice of pizza, we first need to find the volume of the entire pizza. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the pizza is 12 inches, the radius $r$ is half of the diameter, which is $\\frac{12}{2} = 6$ inches. The height or thickness of the pizza is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of an inch.\nTo find the volume of the entire pizza, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V = \\pi r^2 h$. \n\nGiven that the radius $r$ is 6 inches and the height or thickness $h$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of an inch, we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n$V = \\pi \\cdot (6)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nNext step: Calculate the square of the radius (6) and multiply it by $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nTo find the volume of the entire pizza, we'll calculate the square of the radius (6) and multiply it by $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nFirst, we find the square of the radius (6):\n$6^2 = 6 \\cdot 6 = 36$\n\nNow, we'll multiply the square of the radius by $\\frac{1}{3}$:\n$36 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{36}{3} = 12$\n\nSo, $V = \\pi \\cdot 12$. \n\nNow that we have the formula for the volume of the entire pizza, we can find the volume of one piece. Since the pizza is cut into 12 congruent pieces, we'll divide the volume of the entire pizza by 12.\n\n$V_{one\\ piece} = \\frac{V}{12} = \\frac{\\pi \\cdot 12}{12} = \\pi$\n\nTherefore, the volume of one piece of pizza is $\\boxed{\\pi}$ cubic inches.",
