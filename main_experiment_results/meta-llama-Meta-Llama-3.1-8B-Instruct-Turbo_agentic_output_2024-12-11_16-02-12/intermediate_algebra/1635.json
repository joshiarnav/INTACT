            "To solve the quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn this case, $a = 9$, $b = -36$, and $c = 16$.\n\nPlugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{-(-36) \\pm \\sqrt{(-36)^2 - 4(9)(16)}}{2(9)}$\n\nSimplifying the expression under the square root, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{1296 - 576}}{18}$\n\n$x = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{720}}{18}$\n\n$x = \\frac{36 \\pm 12\\sqrt{5}}{18}$\n\n$x = \\frac{18 \\pm 6\\sqrt{5}}{9}$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies $f_{1001}(x) = x-3$ is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{18 + 6\\sqrt{5}}{9}}$",
