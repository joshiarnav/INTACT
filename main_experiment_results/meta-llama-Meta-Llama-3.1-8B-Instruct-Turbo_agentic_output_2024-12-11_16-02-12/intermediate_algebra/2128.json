Therefore, the center of the hyperbola lies on both the line $x=5$ and the line $y=3x,$ so its coordinates are $(5, 15).$\n\nBecause the hyperbola has a horizontal axis, the other asymptote must have slope $-3.$ Therefore, we can write a point-slope equation for the other asymptote: \\[y - 15 = -3(x - 5),\\]which is equivalent to $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}.$",
