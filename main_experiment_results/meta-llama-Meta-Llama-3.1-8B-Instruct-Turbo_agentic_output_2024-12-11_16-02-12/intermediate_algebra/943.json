This means that we have not gained any new information from this step.\n\nLet's go back to the previous step and use a different approach to find $ab + ac + bc$ in terms of $a^3+b^3+c^3$ and $a^5+b^5+c^5$.\n\nWe know that $(a+b+c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a+b+c)(ab+ac+bc) - 3abc$. Since we are given $a+b+c=0$, we have $(a+b+c)^3 = 0$.\n\nWe can also use the identity $(a+b+c)^5 = a^5 + b^5 + c^5 + 5(a+b+c)(a^4 + b^",
