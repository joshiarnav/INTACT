    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the division of the integer by 15 and the divisions by 3 and 5. \n\nFirst step: \nLet the integer be denoted by 'x'. According to the problem, when 'x' is divided by 15, the remainder is 7. This can be represented as:\n\nx = 15k + 7, where k is a non-negative integer.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by trying to express 'x' as a sum of multiples of 15 and a constant.\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the value of 'x' in terms of the multiples of 15 and the constant remainder. \n\nGiven that x = 15k + 7, we can rewrite this equation as:\n\nx - 7 = 15k\n\nTo find a suitable multiple of 15 that is also a multiple of 3 and 5, we can express 15k as a sum of multiples of 3 and 5. \n\nSince 15 = 3 * 5, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nx - 7 = 3 * 5 * k\n\nNext, we can express 'x - 7' as a sum of multiples of 3 and 5 by finding the suitable multiple of 15 that is close to 'x - 7'.

However, we are looking for a multiple of 3 and 5 that is less than 'x - 7\nWe can express 'x - 7' as 15 minus a multiple of 15 that is less than 7. The closest multiple of 15 less than 7 is 0 (15 * 0), so we have:\n\nx - 7 = 15 - 0\n\nHowever, this gives us a remainder of 0 when divided by 3 and 5. To find a multiple of 3 and 5 that is less than 7, we can use the next closest multiple of 15, which is 15 * -1 = -15.\n\nx - 7 = 15 - 15 = 0 + 0 = 0 \n\nHowever this is incorrect as 0 + 0 = 0 not 7, so the next closest multiple of 15 is actually 15 * 0 = 0 so we can use the next closest multiple of 15 which is 15 * -1 = -15.\nTo find a suitable multiple of 15 that is less than 7, we can use the next closest multiple of 15, which is 15 * -1 = -15.\n\nHowever, using -15 will give us a remainder of 0 when divided by 3 and 5, which is not what we are looking for.\n\nLet's consider the fact that 'x - 7' is 7 less than a multiple of 15.

The multiple of 3 that is less than 23 is 3 * 7 = 21, but the multiple of 5 that is less than 23 is 5 * 4 = 20.\n\nHowever, we need a multiple of both 3 and 5, so we can consider the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5, which is 15.\n\nSince 15 is a multiple of both 3 and 5, we can try to find the multiple of 15 that is close to 8. However, if we add 15 to 8, we get 23, and we already know the multiples of 3 and 5 less than 23.\n\nLet's try to express 'x - 7' as a sum of multiples of 15 and a constant remainder. We have:\n\nx - 7 = 15k\n\nTo find a suitable multiple of 15 that is close to 'x -",
