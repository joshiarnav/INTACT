    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block. We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$. Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{3}$.",

Now, we need to find the 100th digit after the decimal point.\n\nTo do this, we can convert the repeating block to a decimal by dividing 1 by 115384. However, we only need to find the 100th digit. Since the repeating block has 6 digits, we can divide 100 by 6 and find the remainder.\n\n100 \u00f7 6 = 16 remainder 4\n\nThis means that the 100th digit is the 4th digit in the repeating block. So,\nSince the remainder is 4, we need to find the 4th digit in the repeating block 115384. The repeating block is: 1 1 5 3 8 4.\n\nWe can see that the 4th digit in the repeating block is 3.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
