    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Adding the first digits, we get $8$, hence $2$ after carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, again with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $2$, with carrying. Finally, adding $1$ to one, we get $2$. Thus our final answer is $\\boxed{22112_6}$.",
