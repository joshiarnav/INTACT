    "problem": "What is the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 which has two even and two odd digits?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9, we need to follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: To be divisible by 9, the sum of the digits must be divisible by 9. Since we need a four-digit number with two even and two odd digits, let's consider possible combinations that meet the sum requirement.\n\nFor a four-digit number, the sum of the digits must be between 10 (1+2+3+4) and 18 (9+9+9+9). We need to find a combination of two even and two odd digits that sums up to either 18 (for the smallest possible number) or a multiple of 9 that allows us to have a four-digit number.\n\nA possible combination could be 1, 2, 6, and 9, which sums up to 18.\nTo find the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits, let's proceed with the combination 1, 2, 6, and 9.\n\nStep 2: Arrange the digits to form the smallest possible four-digit number. To achieve this, we need to place the smallest digits in the thousands and hundreds places. In our case, the smallest even digit is 2, and the smallest odd digit is 1. Also, we have another odd digit to place. The largest remaining digit is 9, but we need to place it in a way that it forms the smallest number possible.\n\nConsidering the place value, we get the smallest number when the 2 is in the thousands place and the 1 is in the hundreds place. Now we have two odd digits, 1 and 9. We need to place the 9 in the tens place because if we place it in the units place, it would be larger.\n\nHowever, we have an even digit, 6, which should be placed in the units place. So the number should be arranged in the following way: 2169.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 which has two even and two\nStep 3: We have successfully found the smallest four-digit number, 2169. However, we also need to ensure that this number indeed has two even and two odd digits. \n\n- Even digits: 2 and 6\n- Odd digits: 1 and 9\n\nSince we have two even digits (2 and 6) and two odd digits (1 and 9), the number 2169 meets the conditions stated in the problem.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 which has two even and two odd digits is $\\boxed{2169}$.",
