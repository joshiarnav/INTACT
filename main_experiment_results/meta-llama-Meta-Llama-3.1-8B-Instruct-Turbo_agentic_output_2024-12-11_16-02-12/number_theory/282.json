So 7145 is 1 more than a multiple of 8 (893*8 + 1). Thus, 7145 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 8.\n\nFor 7146: The closest multiple of 8 less than 7146 is 7144, which is 893 times 8. So 7146 is 2 more than a multiple of 8 (893*8 + 2). Thus, 7146 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 8.\n\nFor 7147: The closest multiple of 8 less than 7147 is 7144, which is 893 times 8. So 7147 is '3' more than a multiple\nFor 7147: The closest multiple of 8 less than 7147 is 7144, which is 893 times 8. So 7147 is 3 more than a multiple of 8 (893*8 + 3). Thus, 7147 leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 8.\n\nFor 7148: The closest multiple of 8 less than 7148 is 7144, which is 893 times 8. So 7148 is 4 more than a multiple of 8 (893*8 + 4). Thus, 7148 leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8.\n\nFor 7149: The closest multiple of 8 less than 7149 is 7144, which is 893 times 8. So 7149 is 5 more than a multiple of 8 (893*8 + 5). Thus, 7149 leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 8.\n\nNow that we have the remainder for each of these numbers when divided by 8, we can find the remainder of their sum. \n\n7145 leaves a remainder of 1, 7146 leaves a remainder of 2,\n7147 leaves a remainder of 3, 7148 leaves a remainder of 4, and 7149 leaves a remainder of 5. \n\nNow that we have the remainder for each of these numbers when divided by 8, we can find the remainder of their sum. \n\nTo find the remainder of the sum, we can simply add the remainders of each number: \n\n1 + 2 = 3 \n3 + 3 = 6 \n6 + 4 = 10 \n10 + 5 = 15 \n\nFinally, we need to find the remainder of 15 when divided by 8. \n\nThe closest multiple of 8 less than 15 is 16 - 1 which is 16, which is 2 times 8. So 15 is 1 less than a multiple of 8 (2*8 - 1). \nThus, 15 leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 8.\nNow that we have the remainder of the sum when divided by 8, we can conclude that the remainder when $7145 + 7146 + 7147 + 7148 + 7149$ is divided by 8 is 7.\n\n$\\boxed{7}$",
