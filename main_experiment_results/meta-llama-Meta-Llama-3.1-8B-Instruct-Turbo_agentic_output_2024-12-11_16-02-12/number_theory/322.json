    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we need to consider the divisibility rules for different numbers. \n\nStep 1: We start by looking at the hundreds digit. Since we want the largest three-digit integer, we'll start with 9 as the hundreds digit. \n\nSo, the number has the form 9xy, where x and y are the tens and units digits, respectively.\nStep 2: Since the number 9xy is divisible by 9, the sum of its digits (9 + x + y) must be divisible by 9. \n\nTo maximize the value of 9xy, we want to maximize the values of x and y while still maintaining the condition that the sum of the digits is divisible by 9.\n\nSince x and y must be distinct non-zero digits, the possible values for x and y are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 minus 9 itself (which we've already used as the hundreds digit).\n\nWe can start by trying the largest possible value for x, which is 8. \n\nIn this case, the sum of the digits is 9 + 8 + y = 17 + y. Since 17 + y must be divisible by 9, we can try different values of y to find a suitable value.\n\nStep 3: Let's try y = 1, which gives us 9 + 8 + 1 = 18, a multiple of 9. In this case, the number is 981, which meets our requirements.\nNow, let's try to find the next largest possible value for x, which is 7. \n\nIn this case, the sum of the digits is 9 + 7 + y = 16 + y. We need to find a value of y such that 16 + y is divisible by 9.\n\nSince 16 + y must be divisible by 9, we can try different values of y to find a suitable value.\n\nLet's try y = 5, which gives us 9 + 7 + 5 = 21, which is not divisible by 9. \n\nLet's try y = 8, which gives us 9 + 7 + 8 = 24, which is also not divisible by 9.\n\nLet's try y = 4, which gives us 9 + 7 + 4 = 20, which is also not divisible by 9.\n\nLet's try y = 2, which gives us 9 + 7 + 2 = 18, a multiple of 9. In this case, the number is 972, which meets our requirements.\n\nSince we have found two numbers (981 and 972) that meet our requirements, we can continue to\nStep 4: Now that we have found two possible numbers (981 and 972) that meet our requirements, we can continue with the same process to find the next largest possible value for x. \n\nWe've already tried x = 8 and found a suitable number (981), and x = 7 and found a suitable number (972). \n\nThe next largest possible value for x would be 6.\n\nIn this case, the sum of the digits is 9 + 6 + y = 15 + y. We need to find a value of y such that 15 + y is divisible by 9.\n\nSince 15 + y must be divisible by 9, we can try different values of y to find a suitable value.\n\nLet's try y = 9, which gives us 9 + 6 + 9 = 24, which is not divisible by 9.\n\nLet's try y = 6, which gives us 9 + 6 + 6 = 21, which is also not divisible by 9.\n\nLet's try y = 3, which gives us 9 + 6 + 3 = 18, a multiple of 9. In this case, the number is\nLet's continue with the same process to find the next largest possible value for x.\n\nWe've already tried x = 8 and found a suitable number (981), x = 7 and found a suitable number (972), and x = 6 and found a suitable number (963).\n\nThe next largest possible value for x would be 5.\n\nIn this case, the sum of the digits is 9 + 5 + y = 14 + y. We need to find a value of y such that 14 + y is divisible by 9.\n\nSince 14 + y must be divisible by 9, we can try different values of y to find a suitable value.\n\nLet's try y = 7, which gives us 9 + 5 + 7 = 21, which is not divisible by 9.\n\nLet's try y = 4, which gives us 9 + 5 + 4 = 18, a multiple of 9. In this case, the number is 945, which meets our requirements.\n\nWe've found four numbers (981, 972, 963, and 945) that meet our requirements. However, we're looking for the largest three-digit integer, and\nStep 5: Now that we have found four numbers (981, 972, 963, and 945) that meet our requirements, we can compare them to find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.\n\nComparing the numbers, we have:\n- 981\n- 972\n- 963\n- 945\n\nThe largest number among these is 981. However, we need to verify if 981 is indeed the largest three-digit integer that meets the requirements.\n\nTo maximize the value of 9xy, we should also consider values of x less than 5. \n\nWe've already tried x = 8 and found a suitable number (981), x = 7 and found a suitable number (972), x = 6 and found a suitable number (963), and x = 5 and found a suitable number (945).\n\nThe next largest possible value for x would be 4.\n\nIn this case, the sum of the digits is 9 + 4 + y = 13 + y. We need to find a value of y such that 13 + y is divisible by 9.\n\nSince 13 + y must be divisible by 9, we\nStep 6: Since 13 + y must be divisible by 9, we can try different values of y to find a suitable value.\n\nLet's try y = 8, which gives us 9 + 4 + 8 = 21, which is not divisible by 9.\n\nLet's try y = 5, which gives us 9 + 4 + 5 = 18, a multiple of 9.

In this case, the number is 936, which meets our requirements.\n\nSince we have found a number (936) that meets our requirements and is larger than the previous largest number (981), this is a contradiction. However, we should note that this cannot be the case. \n\nTherefore, we must have made an error in our previous calculations and 981 is indeed the largest three-digit\nStep 7: Now that we have found two possible numbers (981 and 936) that meet our requirements, we can compare them to find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.\n\nComparing the numbers, we have:\n- 981\n- 936\n\nThe largest number among these is 981.
