We mistakenly converted the numbers to decimal and performed the addition. Let's try again by analyzing the possible combinations for $A + B$.\n\nFrom the previous steps, we have considered the possible combinations for $B + C$ that result in a carry. We eliminated the combination $(3, 3)$ because $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct, and we know that $B + C$ must result in a carry.",
