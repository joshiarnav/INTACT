    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The units digit of $mn$ is $1^6 = 1$.  Searching for a units digit for $n$ (which is clearly odd), we find that $7 \\cdot 3 = 1$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit of $n$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the units digit of n, we need to first find the units digit of the product $21^6$. \n\nThe units digit of $21^6$ is the same as the units digit of $1^6$, which is 1.\n\nNow, we are given that the units digit of m is 7.\nTo find the units digit of $n$, we know that the product $mn$ has a units digit of 1 (from the previous steps).\n\nWe are also given that the units digit of $m$ is 7.\n\nThe units digit of the product of two numbers is the same as the units digit of the product of their units digits. \n\nSo, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by 7, gives a units digit of 1.\n\nThe only number that satisfies this condition is 3, because $7 * 3 = 21$, which has a units digit of 1.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $n$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
