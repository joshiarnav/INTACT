    "problem": "For some positive integer $k$, when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. What is the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1:** \nGiven: When 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. This can be expressed as:\n\n$$60 = qk^2 + 6$$\n\nwhere $q$ is the quotient. \n\nWe can rearrange this equation to isolate the term $qk^2$:\n\n$$60 - 6 = qk^2$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$54 = qk^2$$\n**Step 2:**\nWe can start by finding the factors of 54. Since $k^2$ is a factor of 54, we can list the possible values of $k^2$.\n\nThe factors of 54 are: \n1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54\n\nSince $k$ is a positive integer, $k^2$ must also be a positive integer. This means we can ignore the negative factors.\n\nWe are looking for the possible values of $k^2$. Therefore, we can ignore the factors that are not perfect squares.\n\nThe perfect square factors of 54 are: \n1, 9, 36 (not in the list but 9 is so we ignore that 54 was not a factor of itself in this case)\n**Step 3:**\nSince we are looking for the possible values of $k$, we need to take the square root of the perfect square factors of 54.\n\nThe perfect square factors of 54 are: \n1, 9\n\nTaking the square root of these factors, we get:\n$k = 1, 3$\n\nHowever, $k^2$ cannot be equal to 1, because 60 divided by 1 will have a remainder of 0, not 6. Therefore, we can ignore $k = 1$.\n\nSo, $k = 3$ is the only possible value of $k$.\n\n**Step 4:**\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$.\n\nSince $k = 3$, we can find the remainder when 100 is divided by 3.\n\nTo find the remainder, we can divide 100 by 3:\n\n100 \u00f7 3 = 33 with a remainder of 1.\n\nSo, the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
