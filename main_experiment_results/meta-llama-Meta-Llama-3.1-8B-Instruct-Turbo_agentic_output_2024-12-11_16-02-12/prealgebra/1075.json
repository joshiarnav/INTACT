    "problem": "There is a committee composed of eight women and two men. When they meet, they sit in a row---the women in indistinguishable rocking chairs and the men on indistinguishable stools.  How many distinct ways are there for me to arrange the eight chairs and two stools for a meeting?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Because the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from each other and the stools are indistinguishable from each other, we can think of first placing the two stools somewhere in the ten slots and then filling the rest with rocking chairs. The first stool has $10$ slots in which it can go, and the second has $9$. However, because they are indistinguishable from each other, we have overcounted the number of ways to place the stools by a factor of $2$, so we divide by $2$. Thus, there are $\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = \\boxed{45}$ distinct ways to arrange the ten chairs and stools for a meeting.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can use combinations. The first step is to choose the positions of the two stools (or men) out of the total 10 positions.\n\nThere are 10 positions in total, and we want to choose 2 positions for the stools. This is a combination problem, and can be represented as \"10 choose 2\", or \"10C2\". The formula for combinations is nCk = n! / [k!(n - k)!], where n is the total number and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, for our first step, we need to calculate 10C2:\n\n10C2 = 10! / [2!(10 - 2)!]\n\nWe'll solve this next.\nTo calculate 10C2, we need to evaluate the expression:\n\n10C2 = 10! / [2!(10 - 2)!]\n\nFirst, let's simplify 10 - 2. \n10 - 2 = 8\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n10C2 = 10! / [2! * 8!]\n\nThe factorial of 10 (10!) can be written as:\n10! = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n\nThe factorial of 2 (2!) can be written as:\n2! = 2 * 1\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n10C2 = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / [(2 * 1) * (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)]\n\nWe can see that 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 appears in both the numerator and the denominator.
