    "problem": "Chloe wants to buy a hoodie that costs $\\$32.75$. She empties her wallet and finds she only has three $\\$10$ bills, eight quarters, and a pile of dimes. What is the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie?",

    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $n$ represent the unknown number of dimes. Chloe's total amount of money is $$3(\\$10)+8(\\$.25)+n(\\$.10) \\ge \\$32.75.$$Simplifying gives  \\begin{align*}\n30+2+.10n &\\ge 32.75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\n.10n &\\ge .75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge \\frac{.75}{.10} \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge 7.5.\n\\end{align*}Chloe must have at least $\\boxed{8}$ dimes in her pile.",

    "model_solution": "To find the minimum number of dimes, let's first calculate how much money Chloe has from the three $\\$10$ bills and eight quarters. \n\nThree $\\$10$ bills equal $\\$30$. Eight quarters equal $8 \\times 0.25 = \\$2$. So, the total amount of money from the bills and quarters is $\\$30 + \\$2 = \\$32$.\n\nNow, let's find out how much more money Chloe needs to buy the hoodie. The cost of the hoodie is $\\$32.75$. Chloe has $\\$32$, so she needs $\\$32.75 - \\$32 = \\$0.75$.\n\nThe minimum number of dimes that Chloe can use to make up the remaining amount is still unknown, so let's proceed to the next step.\nTo find the minimum number of dimes Chloe needs to pay for the remaining amount, we need to calculate how many dimes are required to make up $\\$0.75$.\n\nSince each dime is worth $\\$0.10$, we can divide the remaining amount ($\\$0.75$) by the value of one dime ($\\$0.10$). \n\n$\\$0.75 \\div \\$0.10 = 7.5$\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a coin, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This is because Chloe needs at least 7.5 dimes to pay for the remaining amount, but she can't use half of a dime.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of dimes that Chloe must have in her pile is $\\boxed{8}$ dimes.",
