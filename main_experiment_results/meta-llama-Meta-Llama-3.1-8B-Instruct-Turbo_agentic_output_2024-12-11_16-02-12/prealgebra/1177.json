We can start by finding the largest perfect square that is less than or equal to 1521 and see if we can find another perfect square that adds up to the difference.\nThe largest perfect square less than 1521 is 1449 (since 44^2 = 1936 which is too big, but 43^2 = 1849 which is also too big, so we check smaller numbers until we find one that is close to 1521).\n\nHowever, we need to start by testing a perfect square that is close to the square root of 1521.

Let's calculate the difference between 1521 and 2352.\n\n1521 - 2352 = -831\n\nWe need a perfect square that is 831 more than 2352. However, we can see that 2352 + 49^2 is too big, so we will look at a smaller number. \n\nSince 47 * 47 = 2209, we can add 47^2 to 2352.\n\n2352 + 2209 = 4561\n\nHowever, we are looking for a difference of 831, and we have found a difference of 4561 - 2352 = 2209. \n\nWe can look for a perfect square that is 2209 less than 4561. Since 45 * 45 = 2025, we can add 45^2 to 2352.\n\n2352 + 2025 = 4377\n\nHowever, we can see that 4377 is not 831 more than 2352, but 831 is 4377 - 2352 = 2025 less than 2025",
