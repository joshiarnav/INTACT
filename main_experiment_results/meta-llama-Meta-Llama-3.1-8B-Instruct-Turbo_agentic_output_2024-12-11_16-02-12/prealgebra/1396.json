In this case, we need to move the decimal point 3 places to the right, so the divisor becomes 3.\n\nHowever, we must also move the decimal point of the dividend (0.18) the same way to keep the division accurate, so the dividend becomes 180.\n\nNow the problem becomes: 180 \u00f7 3.\nTo solve the problem, we will continue with the next step after moving the decimal points in the original step.\n\nStep 2: Since we moved the decimal point of the divisor 3 places to the right, we must also move the decimal point of the dividend (0.18) 3 places to the right. Now the problem becomes: 180 \u00f7 3.\n\nTo solve 180 \u00f7 3, we can simply divide 180 by 3.\n\n180 \u00f7 3 = 60.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{60}$.",
