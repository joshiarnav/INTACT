    "solution": "First, quantify the number of marbles each person has:\n\n$\\bullet$ Angela has $a$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Brian has $2\\times a$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Caden has $3\\times(2\\times a)$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Daryl has $5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))$ marbles.\n\nIn total, the four people have $a+2\\times a+3\\times(2\\times a)+5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))$ marbles. And that expression equals 78, since in total the four people have 78 marbles. Now evaluate the resulting equation. \\begin{align*}\n78&=a+2\\times a+3\\times(2\\times a)+5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))\\\\\n&=a+2a+3(2a)+5(3(2a))\\\\\n&=a+2a+6a+5(6a)\\\\\n&=a+2a+6a+30a\\\\\n&=39a \\quad\\implies\\\\\na&=\\boxed{2}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's start by setting up the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.\n\nLet's represent the number of marbles each person has as variables:\n- Angela has $a$ marbles.\n- Brian has twice as many marbles as Angela, so Brian has $2a$ marbles.\n- Caden has three times as many marbles as Brian, so Caden has $3(2a) = 6a$ marbles.\n- Daryl has five times the number of marbles Caden has, so Daryl has $5(6a) = 30a$ marbles.\n\nNow, let's proceed to the next step.\nSince we have represented the number of marbles each person has as variables, we can now set up an equation to represent the total number of marbles. \n\nWe know that Angela, Brian, Caden, and Daryl have 78 marbles in total. So, we can write the equation:\n\\[a + 2a + 6a + 30a = 78\\]\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\\[39a = 78\\]\n\nTo solve for $a$, we need to isolate the variable. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 39:\n\\[a = \\frac{78}{39}\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[a = 2\\]\nTo solve for $a$, we have already divided both sides of the equation by 39, so we have found the value of $a$.\n\nHowever, we can provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n$\\boxed{2}$",
