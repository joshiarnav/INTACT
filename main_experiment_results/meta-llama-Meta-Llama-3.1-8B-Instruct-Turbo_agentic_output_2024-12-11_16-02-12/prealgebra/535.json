    "problem": "We have a cube with 4 blue faces and 2 red faces.  What's the probability that when it is rolled, a blue face will be facing up?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We have 6 equally likely outcomes, corresponding to the 6 faces of the cube.  4 of those 6 outcomes are successful ones (meaning a blue face is facing up).  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability of a blue face facing up when the cube is rolled, we need to determine the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes.\n\nStep 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSince a standard cube has 6 faces, when rolled, any of these 6 faces can be facing up. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 6.\n\nNow, we have the total number of possible outcomes, and we can proceed with finding the number of favorable outcomes.\nStep 2: Determine the number of favorable outcomes.\n\nWe are given that the cube has 4 blue faces and 2 red faces. To find the probability of a blue face facing up, we need to consider the number of blue faces as the favorable outcomes, since these are the outcomes we are interested in.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 4 (the number of blue faces).\n\nNow that we have the total number of possible outcomes (6) and the number of favorable outcomes (4), we can proceed to find the probability of a blue face facing up.\n\nNext step: \n\nStep 3: Calculate the probability of a blue face facing up.\n\nThe probability of an event is given by the formula:\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the probability of a blue face facing up:\nProbability = 4 / 6\nProbability = 2/3\n\n$\\boxed{2/3}$",
