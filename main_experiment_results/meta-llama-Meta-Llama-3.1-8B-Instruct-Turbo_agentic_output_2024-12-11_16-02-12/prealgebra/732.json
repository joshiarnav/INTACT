    "problem": "Amanda, Ben, and Carlos share a sum of money. Their portions are in the ratio of 1:2:7, respectively. If Amanda's portion is $\\$$20, what is the total amount of money shared?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We multiply each part of the ratio $1:2:7$ by 20 to make Amanda's part equal 20, and we have \\[1:2:7 = 1\\cdot 20:2\\cdot 20 :7\\cdot 20 = 20:40:140.\\] This means that  Ben's share is $2\\times 20 = 40$ dollars and Carlos's share is $7\\times 20=140$ dollars.  Therefore, the total amount of money shared is $20+40+140=\\boxed{200}$ dollars.",
