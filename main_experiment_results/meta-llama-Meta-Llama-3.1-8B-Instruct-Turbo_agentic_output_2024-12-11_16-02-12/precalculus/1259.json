            "Now, let's substitute the values into the equation:\n\n\\[\nBC = \\frac{AB \\cdot \\sin A}{\\sin C}\n\\]\n\nWe have $AB = 150$, $\\sin A = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, and $\\sin C = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ (since $\\angle C = 150^\\circ$).\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n\\[\nBC = \\frac{150 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n\\[\nBC = -150\n\\]\n\nHowever, since the length of a side cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of $BC$. Therefore, the other possible value of $BC$ is 150.\n\nNow, we have two possible values for $BC$: 150 and 150. The sum of these values is:\n\n\\[\n150 + 150 = 300\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of $BC$ is $\\boxed{300}$.",
