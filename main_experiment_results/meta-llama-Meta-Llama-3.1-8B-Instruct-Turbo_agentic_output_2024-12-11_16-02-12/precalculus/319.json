However, in this case, the z-component is zero. We can use this fact to our advantage.\n\nThe equation of the plane can be written as:\n\n$120(x - 10) - 120(y - 10) + 0(z - 0) = 0$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$120x - 120y = 1200$\n\nDividing both sides by 120, we get:\n\n$x - y = 10$\n\nNow that we have the equation of the plane, we can find the value of z by using the coordinates of the point $E$.
