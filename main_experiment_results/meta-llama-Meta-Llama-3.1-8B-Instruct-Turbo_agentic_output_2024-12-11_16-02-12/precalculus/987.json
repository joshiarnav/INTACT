The goal is to find the number of real solutions of this equation.\n\nNext step would involve analyzing the properties of the functions involved and how they intersect.\nTo find the number of real solutions of the equation, let's proceed with the analysis:\n\nStep 2: Analyze the properties of the functions involved\nThe equation involves the ratio of x to 100 on the left-hand side and the sine function on the right-hand side. We can start by analyzing the properties of these two functions.\n\n- The function f(x) = x/100 is a linear function, which is a straight line with a slope of 1/100 and a y-intercept of 0.

This function is also continuous and differentiable everywhere, except at points where it has a discontinuity (which is not the case here).\n\nSince both functions are continuous and differentiable, we can analyze their intersection points.\n\nStep 3: Find the intersection points\nTo find the intersection points, we can set the two functions equal to each other:\n\nx/100 = sin(x)\n\nSince the sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, the right-hand side of the equation will lie between -1 and 1. This means that\nStep 3 (continued): \n-1 \u2264 sin(x) \u2264 1, which means that -100 is the upper bound for x/100. \nMultiplying the inequality by 100, we get -100 \u2264 x \u2264 100. \nNow, let's analyze the intersection points.\n\nSince the sine function is periodic with a period of 2\u03c0, the graph of sin(x) will repeat every 2\u03c0 units. \nTo find the number of intersection points, we can divide the interval [-100, 100] into subintervals of length 2\u03c0.\n\nIn the interval [-100, 100], we have 50/\u03c0 \u2248 16 subintervals of length 2\u03c0. However, the sine function does not necessarily intersect the interval [-100, 100] at the end of each subinterval.\n\nTo determine the number of intersection points, let's consider the following:\n\n- The sine function will intersect the line y = x/100 at least once in each subinterval of length 2\u03c0, where the line lies above the sine curve. \n- Since the line y = x/100 has a slope of 1/100, it will be above the sine curve in the subintervals\nStep 4: Determine the number of intersection points\nBased on the analysis of the previous steps, we can conclude that the line y = x/100 will intersect the sine curve at least once in each subinterval of length 2\u03c0, where the line lies above the sine curve.\n\nSince there are 16 subintervals of length 2\u03c0 in the interval [-100, 100], and the line y = x/100 intersects the sine curve at least once in each subinterval, we have at least 16 intersection points.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the possibility of additional intersection points where the line y = x/100 intersects the sine curve more than once. \n\nSince the sine function is symmetric about the origin, the number of additional intersection points must be even. \n\nTo count the additional intersection points, we can consider the graph of sin(x) and the line y = x/100 in the interval [0, 100].\n\nIn this interval, the line y = x/100 has a positive slope, and the sine curve has a maximum at x = \u03c0/2.
