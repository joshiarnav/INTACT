            "Now that we have found the side length of the square $BDEF$, we can proceed to find the area of the regular octagon.\n\nThe area of the regular octagon can be found by subtracting the areas of the four isosceles right triangles from the area of the square $BDEF$. To find the area of each isosceles right triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle:\n\nArea of triangle = (1/2) \u00d7 base \u00d7 height\n\nSince the base and height of each isosceles right triangle are equal to the side length of the square $BDEF$, we can substitute the value of the side length into the formula:\n\nArea of one triangle = (1/2) \u00d7 (\u221a2 - 2) \u00d7 (\u221a2 - 2)\n\nNext, we need to find the total area of the four isosceles right triangles. We can do this by multiplying the area of one triangle by 4:\n\nTotal area of triangles = 4 \u00d7 (1/2) \u00d7 (\u221a2 - 2) \u00d7 (\u221a2 - 2)\n\nNow, we can find the area of the square $BDEF$ by squaring the side length:",
