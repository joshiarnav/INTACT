    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, start by listing the possible candidates for the hundreds digit. Since the number must be a three-digit integer and the largest possible, consider starting with the largest non-zero digit, which is 9.\nSince the hundreds digit is 9, the number must be a multiple of 9. So, the possible candidates for the tens and ones digits are factors of 9. The possible candidates are (1, 9), (3, 3), and (9, 1). However, since the digits must be distinct, we can eliminate (3, 3). Now, we have two possibilities: (1, 9) and (9, 1). \n\nNext step: \nCheck if 991 is divisible by its distinct digits (9 and 1) and is the largest possible candidate that meets the given conditions.\nCheck if 991 is divisible by its distinct digits (9 and 1) and is the largest possible candidate that meets the given conditions.\n\nSince 991 is divisible by 9 and 1, it meets the given conditions. However, this step is still to verify if the conditions are met.\nNext step: \nVerify that 991 is indeed the largest possible three-digit integer that meets the conditions. To do this, we can compare 991 with other possible candidates that meet the conditions. \n\nHowever, we've started from the largest non-zero digit 9 for the hundreds place, so any other larger three-digit number with distinct, non-zero digits in the hundreds place would not meet the given conditions because it wouldn't be divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.\nSince we've started from the largest non-zero digit 9 for the hundreds place, any other larger three-digit number with distinct, non-zero digits in the hundreds place would not meet the given conditions because it wouldn't be divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits. Hence, we can conclude that 991 is indeed the largest possible three-digit integer that meets the conditions.\n\n$\\boxed{991}$",
