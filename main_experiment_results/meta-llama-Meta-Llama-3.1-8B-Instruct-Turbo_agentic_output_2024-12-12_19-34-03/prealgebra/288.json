Therefore, the largest two-digit prime is 97.\nThe next step would be to calculate the product of the two largest one-digit primes (5 and 7) and the largest two-digit prime (97).\nTo calculate the product of the two largest one-digit primes (5 and 7) and the largest two-digit prime (97), we will multiply these three numbers together.\n\nProduct = 5 * 7 * 97\nTo calculate the product, we multiply the numbers together: \n\nProduct = 5 * 7 = 35\nProduct = 35 * 97 = 3395\nThe next step would be to finalize the answer.
