    "problem": "The third and fourth terms of a geometric sequence are 12 and 16, respectively. What is the first term of the sequence?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence. Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$. Solving, we have $a\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  To find the first term of the geometric sequence, we can use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence: an = ar^(n-1), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.\nSince we are given the third and fourth terms, we can write the equations a*r^(3-1) = 12 and a*r^(4-1) = 16.\nThis simplifies to a*r^2 = 12 and a*r^3 = 16.\nStep 2: Divide the equation a*r^3 = 16 by the equation a*r^2 = 12 to eliminate a and solve for r: \n(a*r^3) / (a*r^2) = 16 / 12\nr = 16 / 12\nr = 4 / 3\nStep 3: Substitute the value of r back into one of the simplified equations to solve for a. We can use the equation a*r^2 = 12 and substitute r = 4/3. This gives a*(4/3)^2 = 12.\nStep 4: Simplify the equation a*(4/3)^2 = 12 by calculating the value of (4/3)^2, which is 16/9. This results in the equation a*(16/9) = 12. Multiply both sides by 9/16 to isolate a: a = 12 * (9/16).\nStep 5: Simplify the equation a = 12 * (9/16) by multiplying 12 by 9 and then dividing the product by 16. This gives a = 108/16, which can be further simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 4. This results in a = 27/4.\nStep 6: Simplify the fraction a = 27/4, if possible, and provide the final value for the first term of the geometric sequence.\nStep 7: The fraction a = 27/4 cannot be simplified further, so the first term of the geometric sequence is 27/4.\n$\\boxed{27/4}$",
