    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to consider the properties of a triangle. One of the key properties is the Triangle Inequality, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. In this case, we have sides of length 5 and 6, and the third side has a length of x units. According to the Triangle Inequality, we must have x + 5 > 6, x + 6 > 5, and 5 + 6 > x.\nStep 2: Simplify the inequalities from the Triangle Inequality. We get x > 1, x > -1, and x < 11.\nStep 3: To find the largest possible perimeter, we need to find the largest possible value of x that satisfies the inequalities x > 1 and x < 11. Since x is an integer, the largest possible value of x is 10.\nStep 4: Now that we have found the largest possible value of x, which is 10, we can find the largest possible perimeter by adding the lengths of all three sides: 5 + 6 + 10 = 21.\nStep 5: To confirm that this is indeed the largest possible perimeter, we can try to find the next largest integer value of x, which is 11, and check if it satisfies the Triangle Inequality. However, since x = 11 would make 5 + 6 = 11, violating the inequality 5 + 6 > x, x = 10 is indeed the largest possible value, and the largest possible perimeter is 21.\n$\\boxed{21}$",
