    "problem": "The surface area of a particular sphere is $324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2.\\]  Solving for $r$ and keeping the positive value yields $r^2=81$, so $r = 9$.  Hence the volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=81\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\pi = \\boxed{972\\pi}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Recall the formula for the surface area of a sphere. The surface area A of a sphere with radius r is given by the formula A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2. Given that the surface area is $324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$, we can write the equation as 4\u03c0r\u00b2 = 324\u03c0.\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by $4\\pi$ to solve for $r^2$. This results in $r^2 = \\frac{324\\pi}{4\\pi}$, which simplifies to $r^2 = 81$.\nStep 3: Take the square root of both sides to solve for r, which results in r = \u00b1\u221a81. Since the radius cannot be negative, we take the positive root, giving us r = 9.\nStep 4: Use the formula for the volume of a sphere, V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3, and substitute the value of r into the formula. This gives V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (9)^3, which simplifies to V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (729).\nStep 5: Simplify the expression for the volume by multiplying the terms, which results in V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (729) = \\frac{2916}{3}\\pi = 972\\pi.\nStep 6: Simplify the expression for the volume by multiplying the terms, which results in V = 972\u03c0.\nStep 7: The expression for the volume has been fully simplified, resulting in V = 972\u03c0.\nSince we have already obtained the final simplified expression for the volume in step 7, we can conclude our solution here.\n$\\boxed{972\\pi}$",
