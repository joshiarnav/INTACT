    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we start by listing the possible digits for the hundreds place. \n\nSince we aim for a three-digit number and the aim is for the largest number, we start from the largest possible non-zero digits for the hundreds place, which are 9, 8, and 7.\nFor the tens and ones place, we need to find a number such that the three-digit integer is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits. \n\nSince we started with 9 as the hundreds place, we can list the possible combinations for the tens and ones place. However, we need to exclude combinations that include the digit 0, since 0 is a zero divisor, and the digit 9, since a number cannot be divisible by itself in this context. \n\nWe can start with the digit 8. If the tens place is 8, then the ones place must be 1, 2, 4, or 6 in order for the number to be divisible by 1, 2, 4, and 6.\nWe can now list the possible combinations for the hundreds place as 8 or 7. \n\nFor the hundreds place as 8, the tens place as 8, and the ones place as 1, 2, 4, or 6, we get the numbers 816, 824, 826, and 864. \n\nFor the hundreds place as 7, the tens place as 6, and the ones place as 3 or 9 is excluded but 1, 2, 4, 5 are eligible options.\nWe need to check each number for the hundreds place as 7, the tens place as 6, and the ones place as 1, 2, 4, or 5 to see if it is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits. \n\nStarting with 6 as the hundreds place is not an option since we started with 7, then 8. Now we check the combinations: \n\n- 716 is not divisible by 6 (since 716/6 is not a whole number), so it is excluded.\n- 726 is divisible by 2, 6, and 7, so it is a possible answer.\n- 736 is divisible by 3, 7, and 6, so it is a possible answer.\n- 746 is not divisible by 6 (since 746/6 is not a whole number), so it is excluded.\n- 756 is not divisible by 9 (since 756/9 is not a whole number), so it is excluded, but it is divisible by 6, 7, and 5.\n- 765 is not divisible by 6 (since 765/6 is not a whole number), so it is excluded.\n- 776 is not divisible by 7 or 6 (since 776/7 is not a whole number), so it is excluded.\n- 786 is not divisible by 6 (since 786/6 is not a whole number), so it is excluded.\n- 796 is not divisible by 6 or 9 (since 796/6 is not a whole number), so it is excluded.\n- 806 is not divisible by 6 (since 806/6 is\nWe can now check the remaining combinations for the hundreds place as 7, the tens place as 6, and the ones place as 1, 2, 4, or 5. We already know that 726 is a possible answer and 736 is a possible answer. We need to check the rest of the combinations: \n\n- 756 is divisible by 6, 7, and 5, so it is a possible answer.\n- 781 is not divisible by 1 (since 781 is not divisible by 1), so it is excluded.\n- 782 is not divisible by 2 (since 782 is not divisible by 2), so it is excluded.\n- 783 is not divisible by 3 (since 783 is not divisible by 3), so it is excluded.\n- 784 is not divisible by 4 (since 784 is not divisible by 4), so it is excluded.\n- 785 is not divisible by 5 (since 785 is not divisible by 5), so it is excluded.\n- 786 is not divisible by 6 (since 786 is not divisible by 6), so it is excluded.\n- 787 is not divisible by 7 (since 787 is not divisible by 7), so it is excluded.\n- 788 is not divisible by 8 (since 788 is not divisible by 8), so it is excluded.\n- 789 is not divisible by 9 (since 789 is not divisible by 9), so it is excluded.\n- 791 is not divisible by 1 (since 791 is not divisible by 1), so it is excluded.\n- 792 is not divisible by\nNow we need to check the remaining combinations for the hundreds place as 8, the tens place as 8, and the ones place as 1, 2, 4, or 6.

We need to check the rest of the combinations: \n\n- 826 is divisible by 2, 6, and 8, so it is a possible answer.\n- The remaining number is 824. We need to check if it is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, which are 2, 4, and 8. Since 824 is divisible by 2, 4, and 8, it is a possible answer.\n\nWe can now compare the possible answers. We have 726, 736, 756, 826, and 824. We need to find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.\nWe can now compare the possible answers. The largest three-digit integer among 726, 736, 756, 826, and 824 is 824.\nWe have found the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.
