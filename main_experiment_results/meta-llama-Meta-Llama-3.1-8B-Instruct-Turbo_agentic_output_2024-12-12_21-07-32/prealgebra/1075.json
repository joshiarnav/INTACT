    "problem": "There is a committee composed of eight women and two men. When they meet, they sit in a row---the women in indistinguishable rocking chairs and the men on indistinguishable stools.  How many distinct ways are there for me to arrange the eight chairs and two stools for a meeting?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Because the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from each other and the stools are indistinguishable from each other, we can think of first placing the two stools somewhere in the ten slots and then filling the rest with rocking chairs. The first stool has $10$ slots in which it can go, and the second has $9$. However, because they are indistinguishable from each other, we have overcounted the number of ways to place the stools by a factor of $2$, so we divide by $2$. Thus, there are $\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = \\boxed{45}$ distinct ways to arrange the ten chairs and stools for a meeting.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of distinct ways to arrange the chairs and stools, we will use the combination formula. \n\nStep 1: Determine the total positions and the number of objects to arrange. \nThere are 10 total positions (8 for the rocking chairs and 2 for the stools). We need to find the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 10 for the stools, since the arrangement of the rocking chairs will be determined by the positions of the stools.\nStep 2: Apply the combination formula to find the number of distinct ways to arrange the stools. The combination formula is given by $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items to choose from, and $r$ is the number of items to choose. In this case, $n=10$ and $r=2$. We can plug these values into the formula to find the number of distinct ways to arrange the stools.\nStep 3: Substitute the values into the combination formula. \n\\[\n\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \\frac{10!}{2!8!} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45\n\\]\nStep 4: The calculated value represents the number of distinct ways to arrange the stools, and since the rocking chairs are indistinguishable, their arrangement is determined by the position of the stools. Therefore, the total number of distinct ways to arrange the chairs and stools is equal to the value calculated in Step 3.\nStep 5: The calculated value of 45 represents the number of distinct ways to arrange the stools, which in turn determines the arrangement of the rocking chairs. Therefore, the total number of distinct ways to arrange the chairs and stools is 45.\nStep 6: The total number of distinct ways to arrange the chairs and stools for a meeting is 45.\nSince we have already followed all the steps, the next step would be:\n\n$\\boxed{answer}$",
