    "problem": "Chloe wants to buy a hoodie that costs $\\$32.75$. She empties her wallet and finds she only has three $\\$10$ bills, eight quarters, and a pile of dimes. What is the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie?",

    "solution": "Let $n$ represent the unknown number of dimes. Chloe's total amount of money is $$3(\\$10)+8(\\$.25)+n(\\$.10) \\ge \\$32.75.$$Simplifying gives  \\begin{align*}\n30+2+.10n &\\ge 32.75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\n.10n &\\ge .75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge \\frac{.75}{.10} \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge 7.5.\n\\end{align*}Chloe must have at least $\\boxed{8}$ dimes in her pile.",

    "model_solution": "First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Chloe has from the known bills and coins. \n\nWe know she has three $10 bills, which is 3 * $10 = $30.\nWe know she has eight quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25. So, the total amount from quarters is 8 * $0.25 = $2.\nNow, let's represent the amount of money from the dimes as 'x', since we don't know yet how many dimes she has. Each dime is worth $0.10, so the total amount from dimes is $0.10x.\nChloe's total amount of money from the known bills and coins is $30 (from the three $10 bills) + $2 (from the eight quarters) = $32. To find the minimum number of dimes she must have, we need to determine the remaining amount she needs to pay for the hoodie, which is $32.75 - $32 = $0.75.\nTo find the minimum number of dimes, we need to divide the remaining amount she needs ($0.75) by the value of each dime ($0.10). So, the next step is to calculate $0.75 / $0.10.\n$0.75 / $0.10 = 7.5$\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a coin, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to find the minimum number of dimes.
