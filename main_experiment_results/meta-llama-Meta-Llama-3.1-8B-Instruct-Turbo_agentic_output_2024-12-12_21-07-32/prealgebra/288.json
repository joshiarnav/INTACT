Sorting these numbers gives us 2, 3, 5, 7. So the two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7.\n- We need the largest two-digit prime. We will start by listing some two-digit primes: 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. The largest two-digit prime is 97.\nStep 2: Calculate the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime. \nWe found the two largest one-digit primes (5 and 7) and the largest two-digit prime (97) in the previous step. \nNow, we will multiply these three numbers: 5 * 7 * 97 = 3395.\nThe product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime is 3395.\nThe product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime has been calculated to be 3395.\n$\\boxed{3395}$",
