    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To round $18.4851$ to the nearest hundredth, we must look at the hundreds and the thousands digits of the number in question. Since the thousands digit ($5$) is greater than or equal to $5$, the hundreds digit $8$ rounds up to $9$. Therefore, $18.4851$ rounded to the nearest hundredth is equal to $\\boxed{18.49}$.",

    "model_solution": "To round 18.4851 to the nearest hundredth, the first step is to look at the digit in the thousandth place (5 in this case).\nSince the digit in the thousandth place is 5, the next step is to look at the digit in the ten-thousandth place (1 in this case). If it is less than 5, the digit in the hundredth place remains the same; if it is 5 or greater, the digit in the hundredth place increases by 1.\nSince the digit in the ten-thousandth place is 1 (less than 5), the digit in the hundredth place remains the same.\nSince the digit in the thousandth place is 5 and the digit in the ten-thousandth place is 1 (less than 5), the digit in the hundredth place remains the same, which results in: 18.49\n$\\boxed{18.49}$",
