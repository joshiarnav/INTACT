            "We can find the derivative of the numerator $y^2 + y$ and the derivative of the denominator $y^2 - 1$ to apply L'Hopital's Rule. The derivative of the numerator is $2y + 1$, and the derivative of the denominator is $2y$. \n\nSo, we have $\\lim_{y \\to \\infty} \\frac{y^2 + y}{y^2 - 1} = \\lim_{y \\to \\infty} \\frac{2y + 1}{2y}$.\n\nWe can now simplify the expression by dividing both the numerator and denominator by $2y$.\n\nThis gives us $\\lim_{y \\to \\infty} \\frac{2y + 1}{2y} = \\lim_{y \\to \\infty} \\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{2y}}{1}$.",
