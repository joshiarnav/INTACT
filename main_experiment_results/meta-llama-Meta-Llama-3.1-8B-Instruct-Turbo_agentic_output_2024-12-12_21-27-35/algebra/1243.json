    "solution": "We know that by definition, $i^2=-1$, so $i^4=(-1)^2=1.$ More generally, for all integers k, $i^{4k}=(i^4)^k=1^k=1$. This means that $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}= i^8(i^3)+i^{16}(1)+i^{20}(i)+i^{24}(i^2)+i^{28}(i^3)=i^3+1+i+i^2+i^3$. Since $i^3=-i$, we can simplify this to get our final result: $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}=-i+1+i-1-i=\\boxed{-i}.$",

    "model_solution": "To evaluate the given expression, we first need to understand the properties of the imaginary unit $i$. We know that $i^2 = -1$, $i^3 = i^2 \\cdot i = -i$, and $i^4 = i^3 \\cdot i = -i \\cdot i = 1$.\n\nSince $i^4 = 1$, we can reduce any power of $i$ by taking the remainder when the exponent is divided by 4. This means we can simplify the expression by finding the remainders of 11, 16, 21, 26, and 31 when divided by 4.\n\nThe first step is to find the remainders of 11, 16, 21, 26, and 31 when divided by 4.\nTo simplify the expression, we need to find the remainders of 11, 16, 21, 26, and 31 when divided by 4. \n\nThe remainders are: \n- 11 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 3\n- 16 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 0\n- 21 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 1\n- 26 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 2\n- 31 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 3\n\nNow that we have the remainders, we can simplify the expression by using the properties of $i$. Since $i^4 = 1$, we can rewrite $i^{11}$, $i^{16}$, $i^{21}$, $i^{26}$, and $i^{31}$ as $i^3$, $i^0$, $i^1$, $i^2$, and $i^3$ respectively.\nSince $i^4 = 1$, we can rewrite $i^{11}$, $i^{16}$, $i^{21}$, $i^{26}$, and $i^{31}$ as $i^3$, $i^0$, $i^1$, $i^2$, and $i^3$ respectively. \n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the expression to get: $i^3 + i^0 + i^1 + i^2 + i^3$.\n\nUsing the properties of $i$, we know that $i^3 = -i$, $i^0 = 1$, $i^1 = i$, $i^2 = -1$, and $i^3 = -i$. \n\nSubstituting these values, we get: $-i + 1 + i - 1 - i$.\nNow, we can combine like terms. The expression $-i + 1 + i - 1 - i$ can be simplified by combining the imaginary terms and the real terms separately.\nThe next step is to combine like terms. \n\nWe can simplify the expression $-i + 1 + i - 1 - i$ as follows:\n- The real terms are $1$ and $-1$, which cancel each other out.\n- The imaginary terms are $-i$, $i$, and $-i$, which also cancel each other out.\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to: $0$.\nThe expression $-i + 1 + i - 1 - i$ simplifies to $0$.\nSo, the expression $-i + 1 + i - 1 - i$ simplifies to $0$.\nThe expression simplifies to $\\boxed{0}$.",
