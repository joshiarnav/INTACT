Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.",

            "Step 2:  To find the side length of the square, we start by drawing the diagonal of the square and connecting the center of the circle to the points where the square intersects the circle. This creates two right-angled triangles. Since each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle, the length of the chord is $r$. The diagonal of the square, which is also the hypotenuse of each of the right-angled triangles, can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: the diagonal is equal to $\\sqrt{r^2 + r^2} = \\sqrt{2r^2} = \\sqrt{2}r$. We can then use the properties of a 45-45-90 triangle to find that the side length of the square is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}r}{\\sqrt{2}} = r$.",

            "Step 2:  Let's denote the side length of the square as $s$. Since each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle, we can see that the chord divides the circle into two equal arcs. This means that the angle subtended by the chord at the center of the circle is $60^\\circ$. Using the central angle theorem, we can find the length of the side of the square, which will be equal to $r\\sqrt{3}$.",

            "Step 2:  We know that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle. This indicates that the chord, which is also the side length of the square, forms an equilateral triangle with the radii connecting the center of the circle to the endpoints of the chord. To find the side length of the square, we need to find the height of this equilateral triangle, which will also be the height of the square. Using 30-60-90 triangle properties, we can find that the height of the equilateral triangle is $r\\sqrt{3}/2$. Since the side length of the square is twice the height of the equilateral triangle, the side length of the square is $r\\sqrt{3}$.",
