    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",

The largest multiple of 9 that is less than 100 is 99, but we cannot have a 1 as the tens digit because then it would not be a distinct, non-zero digit. \n\nHowever, 99 is possible because it has a 1 and a 9 as digits that are not distinct, but in this case, we must exclude it from our search. Also, multiples of 9 like 90 are not candidates because they have a repeated digit. \n\nThe next possible number to check is 99 - 9 = 90  is eliminated and 99 is 1 below 99 - 9  which is 90  1 below 90.",
