Thus, if two distinct values of $n$ satisfy it, then all values of $n$ will. Now we plug in $n=0$ and $n=1$ (or some other number), we get $2c - b = 0$ and $11c - b= a^2$ . Solving the equations for $c$ and $b$, we get\\[c = \\frac{a^2}{9} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c - b = -\\frac{a^2}{9} \\implies b = \\frac{2a^2}{9}.\\]To maximize $a + b + c = a + \\tfrac{a^2}{3}$, we need to maximize $a$.

Since the fraction $\\frac{10^n - 1}{10^n + 1}$ is always close to $1$, we can approximate $c$ to be around $36$. This suggests that $c$ could be close to $36$ when $a = 6$.\n\nSince $c$ is a digit, we can try to find a value of $n$ that makes $c$ a digit. We can start by plugging in small values for $n$ and see if we get a digit for $c$.\n\nLet's try $n = 1$. Then, $\\frac{10^n - 1}{10^n + 1} = \\frac{10^1 - 1}{10^1 + 1} = \\frac{9}{11}$. Plugging this into the equation for $c$, we get $c = 36 \\cdot \\frac{9}{11} = \\frac{324}{11}$. This is not a digit.\n\nLet's try $n = 2$.
