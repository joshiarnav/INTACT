    "problem": "Chloe wants to buy a hoodie that costs $\\$32.75$. She empties her wallet and finds she only has three $\\$10$ bills, eight quarters, and a pile of dimes. What is the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie?",

    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $n$ represent the unknown number of dimes. Chloe's total amount of money is $$3(\\$10)+8(\\$.25)+n(\\$.10) \\ge \\$32.75.$$Simplifying gives  \\begin{align*}\n30+2+.10n &\\ge 32.75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\n.10n &\\ge .75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge \\frac{.75}{.10} \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge 7.5.\n\\end{align*}Chloe must have at least $\\boxed{8}$ dimes in her pile.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Calculate the total amount Chloe has without the dimes.\nShe has 3 * $\\$10$= $\\$30$ from the 3 $\\$10$ bills, and 8 * $\\$0.25$= $\\$2$ from the 8 quarters. So, the total amount from the bills and quarters is $\\$30$ + $\\$2$ =$\\32$.\nStep 2: Calculate the remaining balance Chloe needs to pay for the hoodie.\nSince the hoodie costs $\\$32.75$ and Chloe has a total of $\\$32$, we need to subtract $\\$32$ from $\\$32.75$ to find the remaining balance, which is $\\$32.75$ - $\\$32$ = $\\$0.75$.\nStep 3: Calculate the minimum number of dimes needed to cover the remaining balance.\nTo find the minimum number of dimes, we need to divide the remaining balance of $\\$0.75$ by the value of a single dime, which is $\\$0.10$. \n$\\$0.75$ / $\\$0.10$ = 7.5. \nSince we can't have a fraction of a dime, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Chloe must have at least 8 dimes to pay for the hoodie.\nStep 4: \nWe have already found that Chloe must have at least 8 dimes to pay for the hoodie.\nStep 5: \nThe minimum number of dimes that must be in Chloe's pile to pay for the hoodie is $\\boxed{8}$.",
