This gives $2x - 15 = 0$. Next, we isolate the variable $x$ by adding $15$ to both sides of the equation, resulting in $2x = 15$.\nNow we can isolate the variable $x$ by dividing both sides of the equation $2x = 15$ by $2$, resulting in $x = \\frac{15}{2}$.\nNow we can isolate the variable x by dividing both sides of the equation 2x = 15 by 2, resulting in x = 15/2.\nNow we can write $x = \\frac{15}{2}$.\nNow we can write $x = \\frac{15}{2}$.",
