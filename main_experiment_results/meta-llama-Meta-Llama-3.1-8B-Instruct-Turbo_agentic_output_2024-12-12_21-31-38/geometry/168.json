    "solution": "Drawing a diagram and adding $OM$ perpendicular to $AD$, we get\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-1,1);\nB=(1,1);\nC=(1,-1);\nD=(-1,-1);\nE=(-1,-.577);\nF=(-1,.577);\nM=(-1,0);\ndraw(circle(O,1.155));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--A);\ndraw(F--O);\ndraw(O--E);\ndraw(O--M);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"F\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, dir(0));\nlabel(\"M\", M, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (F+O)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (E+O)/2, SE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", M, W);\n[/asy] First note that $O$ is not only the center of the circle but also the center of the square since the diagram is symmetric. Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.",

Given the square and circle diagram, if we draw a line from the center of the circle to the intersection point of the bisector with the square, we will form a right triangle. Let the radius of the circle be r and the side length of the square be s. From the diagram, we can see that the two chords of the circle are each equal in length to the radius of the circle, which forms an equilateral triangle within the square. Since the perpendicular bisector of the chord cuts the chord in half, the two radii that form the right triangle are equal in length to r and s/2, respectively. The triangle formed is a 30-60-90 triangle, where the hypotenuse (r) is twice the length of the shorter leg (s/2) and the longer leg is s. Using the properties of 30-60-90 triangles, we have $r\\cdot\\sqrt{3} = s$.\nNow that we have the relationship between the side length of the square and the radius of the circle ($r\\cdot\\sqrt{3} = s$), we can use this to express the ratio of the areas of the square to the circle in terms of $\\pi$.
