    "problem": "A triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units. The length of the third side is $x$ units, where $x$ is an integer. What is the largest possible perimeter of the triangle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: \nApply the Triangle Inequality Theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. Given sides of length 5 and 6, we have two inequalities:\n- $5 + x > 6$\n- $6 + x > 5$\nThese reduce to $x > 1$ and $x > -5$.\nStep 2: \nWe also need to consider the third inequality, which is obtained from the sum of the lengths of the other two sides being greater than the length of the third side: \n- $5 + 6 > x$. \nThis reduces to $11 > x$.\nSo we have three inequalities: $x > 1$, $x > -5$, and $x < 11$.\nStep 3: \nSince $x$ is an integer and we have the inequalities $x > 1$, $x < 11$, and $x > -5$, we can combine these to get $2 \\leq x < 11$. To maximize the perimeter, we need to find the largest possible value of $x$ within this range. \n\nThe largest possible integer value of $x$ satisfying the inequalities is 10.\nStep 4: \nTo find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we add the given sides (5 and 6) to the largest possible value of the third side (x = 10).
