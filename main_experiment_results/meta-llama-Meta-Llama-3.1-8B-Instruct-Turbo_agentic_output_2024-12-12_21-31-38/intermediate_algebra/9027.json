Multiplying both sides by $s$ gives $98 = 52s - s^2$. Rearranging this equation gives $s^2 - 52s + 98 = 0$. \n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\\[\ns = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\nHere, $a = 1$, $b = -52$, and $c = 98$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\\[\ns = \\frac{52 \\pm \\sqrt{(-52)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 98}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n\\]\nSimplifying the expression under the square root gives:\n\\[\ns = \\frac{52 \\pm \\sqrt{2704 - 392}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\ns = \\frac{52 \\pm \\sqrt{2312}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\ns = \\frac{52 \\pm 48.2}{2}\n\\]\nSo, we have two possible values of $s$: $s = \\frac{52 + 48.2}{2} = 50.1$ and $s = \\frac{52 - 48.2}{2} =",
