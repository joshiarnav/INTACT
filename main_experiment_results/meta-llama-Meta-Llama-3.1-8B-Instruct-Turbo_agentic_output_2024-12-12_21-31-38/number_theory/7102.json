The relation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$ rewrites as\\[c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = a^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\right)^2.\\]Since $n > 0$, $10^n > 1$ and we may cancel out a factor of $\\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ to obtain\\[c \\cdot (10^n + 1) - b = a^2 \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}.\\]This is a linear equation in $10^n$. Thus, if two distinct values of $n$ satisfy it, then all values of $n$ will. Now we plug in $n=0$ and $n=1$ (or some other number), we get $2c - b = 0$ and $11c - b= a^2$ . Solving the equations for $c$ and $b$, we get\\[c = \\frac{a^2}{9} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c - b = -\\frac{a^2}{9} \\implies b = \\frac{2a^2}{9}.\\]To maximize $a + b + c = a + \\tfrac{a^2}{3}$, we need to maximize $a$.

            "We can now compare the coefficients of the $10^{2n}$, $10^n$, and constant terms on both sides of the equation. This gives us the following system of equations:\n\nc = \\frac{a^2}{81},\nb = \\frac{-2a^2}{81},\nc - b = \\frac{a^2}{81}\n\nSince the first and third equations are identical, we only need to consider the second equation, which gives us:\n\nb = \\frac{-2a^2}{81}\n\nWe also know that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all digits between 1 and 9. To maximize the value of $a + b + c$, we should choose the largest possible value of $a$. Since $a$ must be a factor of $c \\cdot 81$, we can try different values of $a$ to find the largest possible value.\n\nWe can start by trying the largest possible value of $a$, which is 9. However, we can see that $c = \\frac{a^2}{81}$ would be less than 1, which is not a valid digit. Therefore, we should try the next largest value of $a$, which is 8. \n\nWe can see that $c = \\frac{a^2}{81} = \\frac{8^2}{81} = \\frac{64}{81}$ is not an integer. So we try the next largest value of $a$, which is 7. \n\nWe have $c = \\frac{a^2}{81} = \\frac{7^2}{81} = \\frac{49}{81}$ and $b = \\frac",
