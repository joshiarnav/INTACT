    "problem": "There is a committee composed of eight women and two men. When they meet, they sit in a row---the women in indistinguishable rocking chairs and the men on indistinguishable stools.  How many distinct ways are there for me to arrange the eight chairs and two stools for a meeting?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Because the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from each other and the stools are indistinguishable from each other, we can think of first placing the two stools somewhere in the ten slots and then filling the rest with rocking chairs. The first stool has $10$ slots in which it can go, and the second has $9$. However, because they are indistinguishable from each other, we have overcounted the number of ways to place the stools by a factor of $2$, so we divide by $2$. Thus, there are $\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = \\boxed{45}$ distinct ways to arrange the ten chairs and stools for a meeting.",

We want to find the number of distinct permutations of these 10 characters, considering that the 'chairs' are indistinguishable from each other and the 'stools' are indistinguishable from each other.\nStep 3: The total number of distinct permutations of the 10 characters can be found using the formula for combinations with repetitions, which is given by n! / (n1! * n2!), where n is the total number of objects, n1 is the number of identical objects of one type, and n2 is the number of identical objects of the other type. In this case, n = 10, n1 = 8 (rocking chairs), and n2 = 2 (stools).\nStep 4: Substitute the values of n, n1, and n2 into the formula n! / (n1! * n2!) to calculate the number of distinct permutations of the chairs and stools. This results in 10! / (8! * 2!). Simplifying the expression, we get 10 * 9 / 2.\nNow that we have simplified the expression to 10 * 9 / 2, we can calculate the final result. \n\n10 * 9 = 90\n90 / 2 = 45\n\n$\\boxed{45}$",
