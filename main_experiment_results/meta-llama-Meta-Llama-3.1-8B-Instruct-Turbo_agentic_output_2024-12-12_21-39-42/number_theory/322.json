    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",

    "model_solution": "First step:  We are looking for a three-digit integer in the form of 100a + 10b + c, where a, b, and c are distinct, non-zero digits. \n\nFor the number to be divisible by each of its digits, it must be divisible by the smallest digit (c) and the second smallest digit (b). \n\nWe start by trying with the largest possible value for the hundreds digit (a), which is 9, as it is the largest non-zero digit.\nSecond step: \nWe start with the largest possible value for the hundreds digit (a), which is 9. For the number to be divisible by its digits, we must have c and b as factors of 100a + 10b + c. Since c must be a factor of 100a + 10b + c, c must be a factor of 100a and 10b + c. \n\nTo find suitable values for c and b, we start with the largest possible value for c, which is 8 (since 7 is not a factor of 100*9). We must find a value of b that also divides 10b + c.\nWe need to find a value of b that also divides 10b + c. Since we're trying to find the largest possible number and c is 8, we need to check the values of b such that b divides 10b + 8 = 10b - 8 + 16 = 10b - 8 + 8 + 16 = 10b + 8 and 10b + c is a multiple of 10 (since 10 divides 10b and 8, 10b + c is a multiple of 10). \n\nAlso, c must divide 100a = 900, so we need to check if the possible values of c (8 or less) divide 900. \n\nWe will start by checking if 8 divides 900, which it does (900/8 = 112.5). Then we will check if there are any suitable values of b that divide 10b + 8.\nWe found that 8 is a valid value for c, since it divides 900. Now we need to find a suitable value of b that divides 10b + 8. We have 10b + 8 = 10b - 8 + 16, and since 10b is a multiple of 10, we can rewrite it as 10b + 8 = 10(b - 0.8) + 16 = 10(b - 0.8) + 10 + 6. This implies that 10b + 8 must be a multiple of 10, and since 6 is 3 * 2, we need to find a value of b that is 0.8 more than a multiple of 10/3 or 10/6, since we can rewrite 10b + 8 as 10b + 10 + 6 = 10(b + 1) + 6. Since 10b + 8 is a multiple of 10 and 6 is 3 * 2, we need to find a value of b that is a multiple of 3 and 2. Therefore, we need to find a value of b that is a multiple of 6. We can try the values 6, 12, etc. since 6 is a multiple of 6. We can start by checking if 6 divides 10 * 6 + 8 = 68.\nThird step: \nSince 6 is a factor of 10*6 + 8 = 68, we have a potential candidate for b. Now we need to check if 6 divides 100*a + 10*b + c = 100*9 + 10*6 + 8 = 908. We have 908/6 = 151.33, which is not an integer. Therefore, 6 is not a valid value for b. We have to try the next multiple of 6, which is 12. We can check if 12 divides 10*12 + 8 = 128. We have 128/12 = 10.67, which is not an integer. However, we can check if 12 divides 10*12 + 8 = 10*12 - 8 + 16 = 10*12 - 8 + 8 + 8 = 10*12 + 8. Since 10*12 is a multiple of 10, we can rewrite it as 10*12 + 8 = 10*(12 - 0.8) + 16 = 10*(12 - 0.8) + 10 + 6. However, this approach does not lead to a solution. We can try the next multiple of 6, which is 18. We have 10*18 + 8 = 10*18 - 8 + 16 = 178.\nNow, we can check if 18 divides 100*9 + 10*18 + 8 = 100*9 + 10*18 - 8 + 16 = 100*9 + 180. Since 180 is a multiple of 18, we can rewrite it as 100*9 + 180 = 100*9 + 18*10. Therefore, 18 is a factor of 100*9 + 10*18 + 8 = 180 + 900 = 1080. Now that we have a potential candidate for b, we need to check if 18 divides 1080. We have 1080/18 = 60, which is an integer. Therefore, 18 is a valid value for b.\nFourth step: \nSince we've found a valid value of b, which is 18, we need to check if 9, 8, and 18 divide 100a + 10b + c = 100*9 + 10*18 + 8 = 1080. We've already checked that 18 divides 1080 and 8 divides 900, which implies that 8 divides 1080. Since 9 is a factor of 1080 (1080/9 = 120), we have found the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.\nFifth step: \nWe have found that the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits is 1080. We can verify this by checking if 1080 is indeed divisible by 9, 8, and 18. We've already done this in the previous step and found that 1080 is divisible by 9, 8, and 18. Therefore, we can conclude that the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits is indeed 1080.\nSixth step: \nThere is no additional step, as we have already found the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits in the previous step. This means that the final answer is $\\boxed{1080}$.",
