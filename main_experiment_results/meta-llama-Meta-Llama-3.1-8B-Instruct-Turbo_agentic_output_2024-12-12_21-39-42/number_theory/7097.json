Let $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ where $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ are distinct primes. Then, we can write $m^m = k \\cdot n^n = k \\cdot (p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k})^{n}$. \n\nSince $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$, the exponent of each prime factor in the prime factorization of $m^m$ must be at least as large as the exponent of the corresponding prime factor in $n^n$. We can write the prime factorization of $m$ as $m = q_1^{b_1}q_2^{b_2}\\cdots q_l^{b_l}$, where $q_1, q_2, \\ldots, q_l$ are primes.\n\nNote that since $m$ is not a multiple of $n$, there must be at least one prime $q_i$ in the prime factorization of $m$ that is not present in the prime factorization of $n$.\n**Step 3:**\n To find the least possible value of $m + n$, let's consider the prime factorization of $n$ again. We can write $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ where $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ are distinct primes. \n\nSince $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$, we can conclude that for each prime $p_i$ in the prime factorization of $n$, the exponent of $p_i$ in the prime factorization of $m$ must be at least $n$.\n\nAlso, since $m$ is not a multiple of $n$, there must be at least one prime $q_i$ in the prime factorization of $m$ that is not present in the prime factorization of $n$. \n\nNow, to minimize the value of $m + n$, let's consider the case where $n = p^a$ for some prime $p$. This implies that $m^m = k \\cdot (p^a)^n$, and the exponent of $p$ in the prime factorization of $m$ must be at least $n$. \n\nWe can write $m = p^n \\cdot q^b$ for some prime $q$ and exponent $b$. \n\nWe need to find the least possible value of $m + n = p^n + p^a$ under the condition that $\\gcd(m + n, 210) = 1$.\n**Step 4:**\nTo minimize the value of $m + n = p^n + p^a$, let's consider the condition $\\gcd(m + n, 210) = 1$. The prime factorization of $210$ is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, so we need to ensure that $p^n + p^a$ does not share any of these prime factors.\n\nWe can analyze the possible values of $p$ and $a$ to satisfy this condition.\n\nSince $p^n + p^a$ must be coprime with $210$, the only prime factor that $p$ can have is $2$. If $p$ has any other prime factors, the sum $p^n + p^a$ will be divisible by those prime factors, violating the condition.\n\nTherefore, we can set $p = 2$. Now, we need to find the smallest values of $a$ and $n$ that minimize the sum $2^n + 2^a$ under the condition that $2^n + 2^a$ is coprime with $210$.\n\nTo find the smallest values of $a$ and $n$, let's consider the condition that $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$.
