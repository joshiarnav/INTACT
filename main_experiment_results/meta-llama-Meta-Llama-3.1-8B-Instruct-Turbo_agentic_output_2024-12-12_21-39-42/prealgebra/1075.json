    "problem": "There is a committee composed of eight women and two men. When they meet, they sit in a row---the women in indistinguishable rocking chairs and the men on indistinguishable stools.  How many distinct ways are there for me to arrange the eight chairs and two stools for a meeting?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Because the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from each other and the stools are indistinguishable from each other, we can think of first placing the two stools somewhere in the ten slots and then filling the rest with rocking chairs. The first stool has $10$ slots in which it can go, and the second has $9$. However, because they are indistinguishable from each other, we have overcounted the number of ways to place the stools by a factor of $2$, so we divide by $2$. Thus, there are $\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = \\boxed{45}$ distinct ways to arrange the ten chairs and stools for a meeting.",

Since there are 10 total positions (8 chairs + 2 stools) and we want to choose 2 of them for the stools, we can use the combination formula. \n\nHowever, since the stools are indistinguishable, we only need to choose 2 positions out of the 10, and the order in which the stools are chosen does not matter.\n\nSo the first step is to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 10.\nThe next step would be to use the combination formula. The formula for choosing k items from n is C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n - k)!], where ! denotes the factorial function. \n\nIn this case, n is 10 (total positions) and k is 2 (positions to choose for the stools).
