    "solution": "Drawing a diagram and adding $OM$ perpendicular to $AD$, we get\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-1,1);\nB=(1,1);\nC=(1,-1);\nD=(-1,-1);\nE=(-1,-.577);\nF=(-1,.577);\nM=(-1,0);\ndraw(circle(O,1.155));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--A);\ndraw(F--O);\ndraw(O--E);\ndraw(O--M);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"F\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, dir(0));\nlabel(\"M\", M, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (F+O)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (E+O)/2, SE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", M, W);\n[/asy] First note that $O$ is not only the center of the circle but also the center of the square since the diagram is symmetric. Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.",

Let the radius of the circle be $r$. \n\n(A detailed description of this step would lead directly into the next step, as we have the radius present)\n2. **Determine the length of the side of the square**: \nFrom the given information, the chord of the circle in the square is equal to the radius of the circle. Drawing a perpendicular from the center of the circle to the chord will bisect the chord, resulting in two right-angled triangles. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the side length of the square in terms of the radius of the circle.\n3. **Find the area of the square and the area of the circle**: \nNow that we have the side length of the square in terms of the radius of the circle, we can calculate the area of the square.

The hypotenuse of the triangle is the radius of the circle ($r$), and half of the base is $\\frac{r}{2}$, as the chord is bisected. Let the other half of the base be $x$ (which will be half of the side length of the square). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get $x^2+(\\frac{r}{2})^2 = r^2$. Solving for $x$, we get $x^2 = r^2-(\\frac{r}{2})^2 = r^2-\\frac{r^2}{4} = \\frac{3r^2}{4}$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}r}{2}$. As $x$ is half of the side length of the square, the side length of the square is $\\boxed{2x = \\sqrt{3}r}$ (it is standard to drop a perpendicular from the top of the cutout to the bottom, so it can be broken into two).",
