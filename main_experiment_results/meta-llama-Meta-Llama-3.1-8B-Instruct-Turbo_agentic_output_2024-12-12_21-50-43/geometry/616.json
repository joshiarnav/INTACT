    "problem": "A triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units. The length of the third side is $x$ units, where $x$ is an integer. What is the largest possible perimeter of the triangle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Therefore, we have three inequalities for the given triangle: \n- The sum of the lengths of the sides with lengths 5 and 6 units must be greater than the length of the side with length $x$ units: \n  5 + 6 > x \n  11 > x \n- The sum of the lengths of the sides with lengths 5 and x units must be greater than the length of the side with length 6 units: \n  5 + x > 6 \n  x > 1 \n- The sum of the lengths of the sides with lengths 6 and x units must be greater than the length of the side with length 5 units: \n  6 + x > 5 \n  x > -1.\nStep 2:  The second inequality $x > 1$ tells us that $x$ must be greater than 1, and the third inequality $x > -1$ imposes no restriction, as all integers are greater than -1.  The first inequality $11 > x$ tells us that $x$ must be less than 11. Combining these three inequalities, we get: $1 < x < 11$\nStep 3: To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to find the largest possible value of $x$. Since $x$ must be an integer and $1 < x < 11$, the largest possible value of $x$ is 10. The perimeter of the triangle would be the sum of the lengths of all three sides, which is $5 + 6 + 10 = 21$.\nSince we have found the largest possible value of $x$ to be 10 and the corresponding perimeter to be 21, we have now found the largest possible perimeter of the triangle.\nStep 4: We have found the largest possible value of x to be 10, and the corresponding perimeter to be 21. This value of x is within the valid range of 1 < x < 11, and it maximizes the perimeter of the triangle. Therefore, the largest possible perimeter of the triangle is indeed 21.\nStep 5: We can verify our solution by ensuring that the given side lengths satisfy the triangle inequality theorem for the largest possible perimeter. Since 5 + 6 + 10 = 21 > 10, it indeed satisfies the triangle inequality theorem for the largest possible perimeter.\nStep 6: Since we have verified that the given side lengths satisfy the triangle inequality theorem for the largest possible perimeter, we can confidently conclude that the largest possible perimeter of the triangle is $\\boxed{21}$.",
