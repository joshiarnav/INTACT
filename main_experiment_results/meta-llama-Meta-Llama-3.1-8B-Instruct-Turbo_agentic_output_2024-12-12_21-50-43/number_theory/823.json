To begin, we can identify all the possible tens and units digits for a clever integer, given that their sum is 9 and the integer must be even.\nSecond Step:\nWe will consider all the possible pairs of tens and units digits that add up to 9, keeping in mind that the integer must be even. These pairs are (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 2), and (8, 1). We note that for the even number condition to be satisfied, the pair must be (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), or (6, 3), (8, 1), as these pairs have even units digits.\nThird Step:\nNow, we'll generate the possible integers for each of the pairs we identified in the previous step. These integers are 5-digit numbers (e.g., $31x6$ for the pair (3, 6) or $15x4$ for the pair (1, 8)). We will then substitute each of the missing digits, $x$, with $0$ through $9$, and check which of these numbers are divisible by $27$. We will then count the total number of possible integers, and from that number, we will count those that are divisible by $27$.\nFourth Step:\nFor each valid pair, we need to list out all the possible 5-digit numbers and find which of them are divisible by 27, to satisfy the initial requirement. We will count how many numbers are divisible by 27 and calculate the fraction of all clever integers that are divisible by 27. We'll list out the possibilities for each pair, find which ones meet the criteria, and finally compute the desired fraction.\nFifth Step:\n\\begin{align*} \n&amp;\\text{For the pair } (1,8): 18x0,18x1,\\dots,18x9 \\implies\\text{ only } 108, 138, 168, 198\\text{ are divisible by } 27.\\\\ \n&amp;\\text{For the pair } (2,7): 27x0,27x1,\\dots,27x9 \\implies \\text{ none of these are divisible by } 27. \\\\ \n&amp;\\text{For the pair } (3,6): 36x0,36x1,\\dots,36x9 \\implies \\text{ only } 360\\text{ is divisible by } 27.\\\\ \n&amp;\\text{For the pair } (4,5): 45x0,45x1,\\dots,45x9 \\implies \\text{ none of these are divisible by } 27.\\\\ \n&amp;\\text{For the pair } (5,4) \\text{ and } (8,1) \\text{ we can deduce in a similar fashion.}\n\\end{align*} \nThere are $5$ possible tens and units digits that add up to 9 and the number must be even.
