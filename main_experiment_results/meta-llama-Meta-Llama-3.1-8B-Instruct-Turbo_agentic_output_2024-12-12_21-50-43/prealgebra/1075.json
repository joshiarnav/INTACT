    "problem": "There is a committee composed of eight women and two men. When they meet, they sit in a row---the women in indistinguishable rocking chairs and the men on indistinguishable stools.  How many distinct ways are there for me to arrange the eight chairs and two stools for a meeting?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Because the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from each other and the stools are indistinguishable from each other, we can think of first placing the two stools somewhere in the ten slots and then filling the rest with rocking chairs. The first stool has $10$ slots in which it can go, and the second has $9$. However, because they are indistinguishable from each other, we have overcounted the number of ways to place the stools by a factor of $2$, so we divide by $2$. Thus, there are $\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = \\boxed{45}$ distinct ways to arrange the ten chairs and stools for a meeting.",

    "model_solution": "To arrange the eight chairs and two stools, we can think of it as choosing two positions out of ten (eight chairs plus two stools) for the stools (or, equivalently, the chairs). \n\nThe first step is to consider how many ways we can choose two positions for the stools out of ten.\nThe next step is to calculate the number of ways to choose two positions for the stools out of ten, which can be done using combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 10 is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where n is the total number of positions (10) and k is the number of positions to be chosen (2).\nThe number of ways to choose 2 positions for the stools out of 10 is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where n is the total number of positions (10) and k is the number of positions to be chosen (2). \n\nThis gives us: $\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \\frac{10*9}{2} = 45$ ways to choose the positions for the stools.\n\nThe next step is to recognize that once the positions for the stools are chosen, the chairs will fill the remaining positions.
