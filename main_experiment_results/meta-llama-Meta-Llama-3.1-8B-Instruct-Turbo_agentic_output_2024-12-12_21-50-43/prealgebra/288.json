Examples include 11, 13, 37, 47, 53, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.\nStep 2: Determine the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime. \nThe two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7. \nTo find the largest two-digit prime, we need to examine the list of two-digit primes: 11, 13, 37, 47, 53, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. \nThe largest two-digit prime is 97.\nStep 3: Multiply the two largest one-digit primes (5 and 7) and the largest two-digit prime (97) to find the product.\nThe product of 5, 7, and 97 is 5 * 7 * 97.\nStep 3: Calculate the product of 5, 7, and 97.\nTo find the product, we simply multiply these three numbers together.\nThe product of 5, 7, and 97 is 5 * 7 * 97 = 3395.\n$\\boxed{3395}$",
