    "problem": "The third and fourth terms of a geometric sequence are 12 and 16, respectively. What is the first term of the sequence?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence. Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$. Solving, we have $a\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's denote the first term as 'a' and the common ratio as 'r'. \n\nStep 1: \nThe formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is a * r^(n-1). \nFor the third term (n=3) we have: a * r^(3-1) = 12 => a * r^2 = 12\nFor the fourth term (n=4) we have: a * r^(4-1) = 16 => a * r^3 = 16\nStep 2: To eliminate 'r', divide the equation for the fourth term by the equation for the third term: (a * r^3) / (a * r^2) = 16 / 12\nThis simplifies to: r = 16 / 12 = 4 / 3\nStep 3: \nNow that we have 'r' = 4/3, substitute this value back into one of the previous equations. Using a * r^2 = 12, we get: a * (4/3)^2 = 12.\nStep 4: \nSimplify the equation: (4/3)^2 = (4^2)/(3^2) = 16/9. Substitute this back into the equation to get: a * 16/9 = 12. Multiply both sides by 9 to isolate 'a': a = (12 * 9) / 16.\nStep 5: \nEvaluate the multiplication: 12 * 9 = 108.
