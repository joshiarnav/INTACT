    "solution": "Drawing a diagram and adding $OM$ perpendicular to $AD$, we get\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-1,1);\nB=(1,1);\nC=(1,-1);\nD=(-1,-1);\nE=(-1,-.577);\nF=(-1,.577);\nM=(-1,0);\ndraw(circle(O,1.155));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--A);\ndraw(F--O);\ndraw(O--E);\ndraw(O--M);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"F\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, dir(0));\nlabel(\"M\", M, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (F+O)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (E+O)/2, SE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", M, W);\n[/asy] First note that $O$ is not only the center of the circle but also the center of the square since the diagram is symmetric. Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.",
