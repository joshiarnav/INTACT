    "problem": "A triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units. The length of the third side is $x$ units, where $x$ is an integer. What is the largest possible perimeter of the triangle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. In this case, we have two known sides with lengths 5 and 6 units, and the third side has an unknown length x units. To find the largest possible perimeter, we need to consider the range of values for x. The length of the third side (x) must satisfy the following inequalities:\n- x < 5 + 6 (x < 11)\n- x > |5 - 6| (x > 1)\nTherefore, the value of x must be an integer between 2 and 10.\nStep 2: Since the value of x must be an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), we can list the possible values of x, which are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\nStep 3: To find the largest possible perimeter, we need to calculate the perimeter for each possible value of x and find the maximum value. The perimeter (P) of a triangle is given by P = a + b + c, where a and b are the lengths of the known sides and c is the length of the third side, which is x in this case. We can substitute the given values and possible values of x into this formula to find the perimeter for each case.\nStep 4: We can calculate the perimeter for each possible value of x by substituting the given values (a = 5 units and b = 6 units) and the possible values of x into the formula P = a + b + c. We will find the maximum value of the perimeter among all the calculated values.\nStep 4: Let's calculate the perimeter for each possible value of x. We will substitute the given values (a = 5 units and b = 6 units) and the possible values of x into the formula P = a + b + c.\n\nFor x = 2, P = 5 + 6 + 2 = 13\nFor x = 3, P = 5 + 6 + 3 = 14\nFor x = 4, P = 5 + 6 + 4 = 15\nFor x = 5, P = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\nFor x = 6, P = 5 + 6 + 6 = 17\nFor x = 7, P = 5 + 6 + 7 = 18\nFor x = 8, P = 5 + 6 + 8 = 19\nFor x = 9, P = 5 + 6 + 9 = 20\nFor x = 10, P = 5 + 6 + 10 = 21\n\nThe large possible perimeter is found when x = 10.\nThe largest possible perimeter of the triangle is $\\boxed{21}$ units, which occurs when the third side has a length of 10 units.",
