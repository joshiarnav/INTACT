This means that either $x^6 = 0$ or $g(x) = 0$. Since $x$ is a positive real number, $x^6$ will be greater than 0 and cannot equal 0, so we only need to consider $g(x) = 0$.\nSince we have g(x) = x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379, and we are looking for positive real solutions, we can consider the derivative of g(x), denoted as g'(x).\nStep 3: Find the derivative of $g(x)$ with respect to $x$, denoted as $g'(x)$. This can be done by applying the power rule of differentiation to each term in $g(x)$. The derivative $g'(x)$ will help us analyze the behavior of $g(x)$ and where it might intersect or touch the x-axis (in other words, where the positive real solutions to $g(x) = 0$ may occur). \n\n$g'(x) = 4x^3 + 21x^2 + 28x + 1729$\nStep 4: To analyze the behavior of $g(x) = 0$ and determine the number of positive real solutions, we need to examine the roots of $g'(x) = 0$. We can do this by finding the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $4x^3 + 21x^2 + 28x + 1729 = 0$. If $g'(x) = 0$ has more than one positive real root, then $g(x) = 0$ will have at least one positive real solution. We can find the roots of $g'(x) = 0$ to determine the behavior of $g(x) = 0$ and find the number of positive real solutions.\nTo examine the roots of $g'(x) = 0$, we need to find the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $4x^3 + 21x^2 + 28x + 1729 = 0$.

We have $g'(100) = 4(100)^3 + 21(100)^2 + 28(100) + 1729 > 0$. This suggests that $g(x)$ is an increasing function for large values of $x$.\n\nTo determine the number of positive real solutions, we can examine the critical points of $g'(x)$ and apply Descartes' Rule of Signs to $g'(x)$.\nStep 6:\nTo apply Descartes' Rule of Signs, we need to examine the signs of the coefficients of the polynomial $g'(x) = 4x^3 + 21x^2 + 28x + 1729$. \n\nThere are four sign changes in the coefficients of $g'(x)$, which means that $g'(x)$ can have at most four positive real roots according to Descartes' Rule of Signs.\nTo apply Descartes' Rule of Signs to $g'(x) = 4x^3 + 21x^2 + 28x + 1729$, we can analyze the signs of the coefficients. There are four sign changes in the coefficients of $g'(x)$ (from + to +, + to +, + to -, and + to +), and no sign changes from - to - or - to +. This corresponds to at most 4 positive real roots for $g'(x) = 0$. Since $g'(x) = 0$ has at most 4 positive real roots, this means that $g(x)$ will have at most 4 positive real solutions.\nTo find the exact number of positive real solutions to $g(x) = 0$, we need to examine the behavior of $g'(x)$ further and determine the exact number of positive real roots it has. We can do this by analyzing the graph of $g'(x)$ and looking for any turning points or intercepts that could indicate the presence of positive real roots.\n\nLet's examine the graph of $g'(x)$ to determine the exact number of positive real roots.

By doing this, we can gain a better understanding of the number of positive real solutions to $g(x) = 0$.\n\nSince the initial evaluation of $g'(100) > 0$ for a large value $x = 100$, we can look at the rest of the function for larger x values. After looking at $g'(x)$, note that $g'(x) > 0$ for $x > 0$ because $g'(x) = 4x^3 + 21x^2 + 28x + 1729 > -1729 + 21x^2 + 28x$, which at $x=0$ equals $-1729$. When $x$ approaches infinity, $g'(x)$ is dominated by the $4x^3$ term.
