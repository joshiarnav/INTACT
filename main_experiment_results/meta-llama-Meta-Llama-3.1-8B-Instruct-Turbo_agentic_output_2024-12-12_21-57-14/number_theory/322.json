    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",

The largest three-digit number is 999, so we will start by testing 9 and then 8.\nWe will assume the hundreds digit is 9 and the tens digit is 8, since we are testing them both to find the largest possible number. Now we need to find the units digit, such that the resulting number is divisible by 9 and 8.\nSince we want the number to be divisible by 9 and 8, we'll first check divisibility by 9. For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. In this case, 9 + 8 + units digit must be divisible by 9.
