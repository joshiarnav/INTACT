The prime factorization of $210$ is $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7$, so $m+n$ should not be divisible by $2, 3, 5$, or $7$.\n\nThe condition $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$ suggests that we should look for relationships between the factors of $m$ and $n$. This condition implies that there exists some integer $x$ such that $n^n \\mid m^m$ if and only if $x \\mid n$ and $x^x \\mid m$. This reduces our problem to finding the smallest $m, n$ where $x > 1$ and $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1$ under the constraint $n > x > 1$.\n\nTo proceed, one should consider possible values of $x$ and how they affect the choice of $m$ and $n$. \n\nThis gives us a simple approach to handle these restrictions systematically one by one.\nSince we need $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1$ and the prime factors of $210$ are $2, 3, 5, 7$, we cannot have both $m$ and $n$ divisible by any of these primes. Moreover, we cannot have $n$ divisible by $2$ or $3$ since otherwise, $\\gcd(m+n, 210) \\leq \\gcd(n, 210) \\leq 3.$ So let's consider possible values of $x$ where $x > 1$.\nSince $x > 1$ and $x$ is a divisor of $n$, we can consider the smallest possible values of $x$. It follows that we should consider values of $x$ that are at least $2$ but less than $7$. \n\nWe note that if $x$ is a power of $2$, or a power of $3$, and in particular, if $x$ is $4$ or $9$, then $x^x$ is divisible by $8$ or $27$. These values of $x$ are candidates for $x$.\nLet's analyze each candidate for $x$ in terms of finding suitable values for $m$ and $n$ that meet the given conditions and constraints. \n\nFor $x = 4$, we need $4^4 | m$ but there is no requirement to ensure $4 | n.$ So we should consider multiples of $x$ that are less than $7$ as possibilities for $n$. If $n = 4$, then we can choose $m$ such that $4^4 | m$ but we also need to make sure that $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1$ to maintain our constraint. Consider choosing $m = 64k$ where $k$ is a positive integer that is not divisible by any of the prime factors of $210$. This ensures that $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1$ if we also ensure that $4 \\nmid k$. This doesn't violate our requirement that $x > 1$.\nTo continue, we need to determine if $m = 64k$ and $n = 4$ satisfy the condition $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$. We know that $4^4 \\mid m$ since $m = 64k$. To show that $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$, we need to show that $m^m = (64k)^{64k}$ is a multiple of $4^{4k} = n^{n}$. Since $k$ is not divisible by $2$, we have that $2^{2 \\cdot 64k}$ divides $(64k)^{64k} = (2^{6})^{64k} = 2^{384k}$, so we can choose $k$ such that $2^{192} \\mid k$ to ensure that $m^m$ is a multiple of $4^{4k}$.\nTo show that $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$, we need to find a suitable value of $k$ such that $2^{192} \\mid k$. To minimize $k$, we should take the smallest power of $2$ that will satisfy the condition $2^{192} \\mid k$. This will ensure that the sum $m+n$ is minimized as well. \n\nWe can then choose $k = 2^{192} \\cdot 5^{\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha$ is a positive integer. This guarantees that $k$ is not divisible by $2$, and ensures that $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$ for the chosen values of $m$ and $n$. \n\nWith $m = 64k = (2^6)(2^{192} \\cdot 5^{\\alpha}) = 2^{198} \\cdot 5^{\\alpha}$ and $n = 4 = 2^2$, we can verify whether the sum $m+n$ is still coprime to $210$.\nThe sum $m+n$ is given by $2^{198} \\cdot 5^{\\alpha} + 2^2$. We need to show that $m+n$ is coprime to $210$, which means it should not be divisible by $2, 3, 5$, or $7$.\n\nNote that $2^{198} \\cdot 5^{\\alpha}$ is divisible by $5$, but the $2^2$ term is not divisible by $5$. Since the $2^2$ term is divisible by $2$, and the $2^{198} \\cdot 5^{\\alpha}$ term is not divisible by $2$, their sum cannot be divisible by $2^2$ or higher powers of $2$.\n\nWe need to determine whether $m+n$ is divisible by $3$ or $7$. Since $2^{198} \\cdot 5^{\\alpha}$ is divisible by neither $3$ nor $7$, and the $2^2$ term is also not divisible by $3$ or $7$, their sum cannot be divisible by $3$ or $7$ unless $\\alpha$ is sufficiently large. \n\nHowever, as long as $\\alpha > 0$, we can ensure that $m+n$ is not divisible by $3$ or $7$ since $5^{\\alpha}$ is not divisible by $3$ or $7$. Therefore, by choosing any positive integer $\\alpha$, we can ensure that $m+n$ satisfies the constraint that it is coprime to $210$.\n\nTherefore, the least possible value of $m+n$ is achieved when $m = 2^{198} \\cdot\nTo find the least possible value of $m+n$, we need to find the smallest value of $\\alpha$ that satisfies the conditions. \n\nHowever, we know that $m+n = 2^{198} \\cdot 5^{\\alpha} + 2^2$ needs to be coprime to $210 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$.\n\nWe also know that $m+n$ is not divisible by $2$, $3$, or $5$ as long as $\\alpha > 0$. However, we need to show that it is also not divisible by $7$.\n\nTo show that $m+n$ is not divisible by $7$, we can consider the value of $m+n$ modulo $7$. \n\nWe know that $2^{198} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{7}$, and $2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$. \n\nThus, $m+n = 2^{198} \\cdot 5^{\\alpha} + 2^2 \\equiv (-1) \\cdot 5^{\\alpha} + 4 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nBy evaluating different values of $\\alpha$, we can determine the value of $\\alpha$ that satisfies this congruence and minimizes the value of $m+n$.\nSince we need $m+n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$ and we know that $5^{\\alpha}$ is not divisible by $7$ when $\\alpha > 0$, we can try small values of $\\alpha$ to find a suitable value.\n\nStarting with $\\alpha = 1$, we have $m+n = 2^{198} \\cdot 5 + 2^2 \\equiv -5 + 4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nTrying $\\alpha = 2$, we have $m+n = 2^{198} \\cdot 25 + 2^2 \\equiv -25 + 4 \\equiv -21 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nTrying $\\alpha = 3$, we have $m+n = 2^{198} \\cdot 125 + 2^2 \\equiv -125 + 4 \\equiv -121 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nTrying $\\alpha = 4$, we have $m+n = 2^{198} \\cdot 625 + 2^2 \\equiv -625 + 4 \\equiv -621 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nTrying $\\alpha = 5$, we have $m+n = 2^{198} \\cdot 3125 + 2^2 \\equiv -3125 + 4 \\equiv -3121 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nWe find that $\\alpha = 5$ satisfies the congruence $m+n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.\nTo find the least possible value of $m+n$, we have found that $\\alpha = 5$ satisfies the congruence $m+n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$. We now want to minimize the value of $m+n$ for this choice of $\\alpha$.\n\nWith $\\alpha = 5$, we have $m+n = 2^{198} \\cdot 5^5 + 2^2$. \n\nWe can simplify this expression by noticing that $2^{198} \\cdot 5^5 = (2^5)^{39} \\cdot 5^5 = 32^{39} \\cdot 5^5 = (5 \\cdot 6.4)^{39} \\cdot 5^5$.\n\nThis gives us $m+n = (5 \\cdot 6.4)^{39} \\cdot 5^5 + 4 > (5 \\cdot 6.4)^{39} \\cdot 5^5$. \n\nSince $5 \\cdot 6.4 = 32$, we can substitute $32$ into the expression to get $m+n > (32)^{39} \\cdot 5^5$.\n\nTo find a lower bound for $m+n$, we can make an approximation using the value of $m+n \\pmod{7}$.\n\nWe know that $m+n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$, and we have found that $\\alpha = 5$ satisfies this congruence.\n\nWe can then write $m+n = (7k + 4)$, where $k$ is some positive integer.\n\nSince $m+n > (32)^{39} \\cdot",
