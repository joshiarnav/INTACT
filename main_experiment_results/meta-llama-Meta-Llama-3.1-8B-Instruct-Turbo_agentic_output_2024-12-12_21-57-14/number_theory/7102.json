    "solution": "Observe $A_n = a(1 + 10 + \\dots + 10^{n - 1}) = a \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$; similarly $B_n = b \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ and $C_n = c \\cdot \\tfrac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}$.

Thus, if two distinct values of $n$ satisfy it, then all values of $n$ will. Now we plug in $n=0$ and $n=1$ (or some other number), we get $2c - b = 0$ and $11c - b= a^2$ . Solving the equations for $c$ and $b$, we get\\[c = \\frac{a^2}{9} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c - b = -\\frac{a^2}{9} \\implies b = \\frac{2a^2}{9}.\\]To maximize $a + b + c = a + \\tfrac{a^2}{3}$, we need to maximize $a$.
