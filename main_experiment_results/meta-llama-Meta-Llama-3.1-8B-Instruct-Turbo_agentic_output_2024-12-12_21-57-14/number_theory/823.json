    "solution": "You can easily list out the numbers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add to 9: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.\n\nTo be a $\\emph{clever integer}$ the number must be even, which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, a total of 5 numbers.\n\nThe problem asks which fraction of these five clever integers are divisible by 27. Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",

In this case, the given conditions are that the number is an even integer greater than 20, less than 120, and the sum of its digits is 9.\nList out the possible digit pairs that sum up to 9: (0,9), (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1), and (9,0). We will then combine these pairs to form 2-digit and 3-digit numbers within the given range, and verify that the resulting numbers are even.\nThe next step is to systematically list the combinations of the pairs (0,9), (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1), and (9,0) to form 2-digit and 3-digit numbers within the given range (greater than 20 and less than 120), and to verify that the resulting numbers are even. This will involve some trial and error, considering the restrictions on the number of digits and the value of the number itself.\nNow that we have the possible digit pairs, we need to systematically list the combinations of these pairs to form 2-digit and 3-digit numbers within the given range (greater than 20 and less than 120) and verify that the resulting numbers are even. We will analyze each pair for this specific case:\nThe possible combinations when considering the given constraints are as follows:\n\n- 2-digit numbers:\n  - 18, 81: Not even.\n  - 27, 72: Not even.\n  - 36, 63: Not even.\n  - 45, 54: Not even.\n  - 78, 87: Not even.\n  - 90, 09: 90 is even.\n  \n- 3-digit numbers:\n  - 108, 801, 810: These are the ones that adhere to the constraints given in the problem.\n\nThis is the next step.\nNow that we have the possible clever integers, the next step is to identify how many of these integers are divisible by 27, as the problem asks for the fraction of all clever integers that is divisible by 27.
