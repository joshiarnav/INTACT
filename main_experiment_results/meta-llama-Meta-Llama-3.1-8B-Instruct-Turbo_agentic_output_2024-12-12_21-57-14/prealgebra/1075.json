    "problem": "There is a committee composed of eight women and two men. When they meet, they sit in a row---the women in indistinguishable rocking chairs and the men on indistinguishable stools.  How many distinct ways are there for me to arrange the eight chairs and two stools for a meeting?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Because the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from each other and the stools are indistinguishable from each other, we can think of first placing the two stools somewhere in the ten slots and then filling the rest with rocking chairs. The first stool has $10$ slots in which it can go, and the second has $9$. However, because they are indistinguishable from each other, we have overcounted the number of ways to place the stools by a factor of $2$, so we divide by $2$. Thus, there are $\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = \\boxed{45}$ distinct ways to arrange the ten chairs and stools for a meeting.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of distinct arrangements, we can view the 10 total \"seats\" as positions to be filled. For the first step, we need to choose the positions where the 2 \"stools\" (men) will be seated out of the 10 total positions.\nWe need to choose the positions where the 2 \"stools\" (men) will be seated out of the 10 total positions. This is a combination problem, and we can calculate this as ${10 \\choose 2}$, which is equal to $\\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!}$\nWe can simplify the combination: ${10 \\choose 2} = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \\frac{10*9}{2} = 45$.\n\nNow, we need to consider that the two stools are indistinguishable from each other. Therefore, we must divide the total number of ways to arrange the stools by 2, because swapping the two stools yields the same arrangement.\n\nLet's do the next step for this part.\nNext step: To find the number of distinct arrangements, we must divide the total number of ways to arrange the stools by 2, and we must also divide by the number of ways to arrange the 8 indistinguishable rocking chairs. Since the chairs are also indistinguishable, we need to divide by 8! (8 factorial) as any arrangement of the chairs is considered the same.
