    "problem": "Chloe wants to buy a hoodie that costs $\\$32.75$. She empties her wallet and finds she only has three $\\$10$ bills, eight quarters, and a pile of dimes. What is the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie?",

    "solution": "Let $n$ represent the unknown number of dimes. Chloe's total amount of money is $$3(\\$10)+8(\\$.25)+n(\\$.10) \\ge \\$32.75.$$Simplifying gives  \\begin{align*}\n30+2+.10n &\\ge 32.75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\n.10n &\\ge .75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge \\frac{.75}{.10} \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge 7.5.\n\\end{align*}Chloe must have at least $\\boxed{8}$ dimes in her pile.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: \nDetermine the total cost of the hoodie, which is $\\$32.75$. Chloe already has three $\\$10$ bills, so she has paid $\\$30$ towards the hoodie cost. Therefore, she still owes $\\$32.75 - \\$30 = \\$2.75$ for the hoodie. This $\\$2.75$ amount needs to be covered by the quarters and dimes only.\nStep 2: \nNext, let's calculate how much money Chloe has from the quarters. Since she has eight quarters and each quarter is worth $\\$0.25$, the total amount she can pay using quarters is $8 \\times \\$0.25 = \\$2.00$. Since Chloe still owes $\\$2.75$ after using the three $\\$10$ bills, she needs to make up the remaining amount, which is $\\$2.75 - \\$2.00 = \\$0.75$, using only dimes.\nStep 3: \nTo find the minimum number of dimes Chloe needs to pay the remaining $\\$0.75$, we can divide $\\$0.75$ by the value of each dime, which is $\\$0.10$, resulting in $ \\$0.75 \\div \\$0.10 = 7.5$. Since we can't have a fraction of a coin, and we know that Chloe must have a whole number of dimes, she will need at least $\\lceil 7.5 \\rceil = 8$ dimes to cover the remaining $\\$0.75$ amount.\n$\\boxed{8}$",
