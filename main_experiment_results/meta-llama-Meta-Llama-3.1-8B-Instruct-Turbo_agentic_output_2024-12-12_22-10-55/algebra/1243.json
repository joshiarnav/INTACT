    "solution": "We know that by definition, $i^2=-1$, so $i^4=(-1)^2=1.$ More generally, for all integers k, $i^{4k}=(i^4)^k=1^k=1$. This means that $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}= i^8(i^3)+i^{16}(1)+i^{20}(i)+i^{24}(i^2)+i^{28}(i^3)=i^3+1+i+i^2+i^3$. Since $i^3=-i$, we can simplify this to get our final result: $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}=-i+1+i-1-i=\\boxed{-i}.$",

    "model_solution": "To evaluate the given expression, we will first express each term using the properties of the imaginary unit $i$. \n\nThe first term is $i^{11}$.  Since $i^4=1$, we can simplify the power by expressing it in terms of multiples of $i^4$.  We start by finding the largest multiple of $4$ that is less than or equal to $11$ and then proceed with the rest of the power.\n\nThe largest multiple of $4$ less than or equal to $11$ is $4 \\times 2 = 8$,  having been expressed we can reduce our argument from $i^{11}$ to $(i^{8}) (i^{3})$.\nSince $i^4 = 1$, we can rewrite $i^8$ as $(i^4)^2$, which equals 1.  Therefore, $(i^8)(i^3)$ simplifies to $i^3$.\nSince $i^4 = 1$, we can rewrite $i^8$ as $(i^4)^2$, which equals 1.  Therefore, we can simplify $i^{11}$ to $i^{11} = i^8 \\cdot i^3 = i^4 \\cdot i^4 \\cdot i^3 = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot i^3 = i^3$.\n\nNow, we can express $i^{3}$ using the property that $i^2 = -1$. Multiplying both sides by $i$, we get $i^3 = i^2 \\cdot i = -i$.\n\nAfter the $i^{11}$ simplification, we should simplify the rest using similar methods to express $i^{16}$, $i^{21}$, and $i^{26}$ strictly. \n\nBut in a general sense we'll simplify the $i^{16}$ as $(i^4)^4$ which simplifies to $1^4 = 1$, we simplify the $i^{21}$ as $(i^4)^5 \\cdot i$  which simplifies to $1 \\cdot i = i$.  Then, we simplify the $i^{26}$ as $(i^4)^6 \\cdot i^2$ which simplifies to $1 \\cdot (-1) = -1$.\nWe have $i^{11} = i^3 = -i$ as previously simplified.\n\nNow, we can simplify $i^{31}$ as $(i^4)^7 \\cdot i^3$. Since $i^4 = 1$, we can rewrite this as $1^7 \\cdot i^3 = i^3$. \n\nAs we previously simplified, $i^3 = -i$.\n\nSo $i^{31}$ simplifies to $-i$.\nNow, we will substitute the simplified values of each term into the given expression: \n$i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}$. \n\nWe previously found that $i^{11} = -i$, $i^{16} = 1$, $i^{21} = i$, $i^{26} = -1$, and $i^{31} = -i$. \n\nSubstituting these values into the given expression gives: \n$-i + 1 + i - 1 -i$.\nWe combine like terms in the expression $-i + 1 + i - 1 -i$. \n\nThe like terms are the $i$ terms, the $-i$ terms, the 1 terms, and the $-1$ terms. \n\nFor the $i$ terms, we have $i + i$, which simplifies to $2i$. \n\nFor the $-i$ terms, we have $-i -i$, which simplifies to $-2i$.\n\nFor the 1 terms, we have $1 - 1$, which simplifies to $0$.\n\nFor the $-1$ terms, we have $-1 - 1$, which simplifies to $-2$.\n\nNow, we can combine the simplified terms: $-2i + 0 - 2$. \n\nSubtracting the two whole numbers, we have $-2i - 2$.\nThe expression $-2i + 0 - 2$ simplifies to $-2i - 2$. This is the final simplified expression.\nThe expression $-2i - 2$ is the final simplified expression.\nCombine like terms: $-2i - 2$. This simplifies to $\\boxed{-2 - 2i}$.",
