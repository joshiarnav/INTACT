    "problem": "Phoenix hiked the Rocky Path Trail last week. It took four days to complete the trip. The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles. The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day. The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles. The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles.

    "solution": "Let the number of miles Phoenix hiked in each day be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=22\\\\\n(b+c)/2=13 \\Rightarrow b+c&=26\\\\\nc+d&=30\\\\\na+c&=26\n\\end{align*} Notice that we do not have to solve for any of the variables. We can add $a + b = 22$ to $c + d = 30$ and find that $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52.$ Therefore, the entire trail was $\\boxed{52}$ miles long.",

    "model_solution": "Let's denote the miles hiked on each day as 'a' (day 1), 'b' (day 2), 'c' (day 3), and 'd' (day 4).\n\nStep 1: Define the system of equations based on the given information:\n1. a + b = 22 (first two days total)\n2. (b + c)/2 = 13 (second and third day's average)\n3. c + d = 30 (last two days total)\n4. a + c = 26 (total of first and third days)\n\nThis will be used to solve for 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.\nStep 2: Simplify the second equation by multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: \n2*(b + c)/2 = 2*13 \nThis simplifies to: \nb + c = 26\nStep 3: We have already simplified the second equation to b + c = 26. To eliminate variables and make it easier to solve the system of equations, we can subtract the simplified second equation from the equation c + d = 30. This will give us the value of d - c. So, d - c = (c + d) - (b + c) = 30 - 26 = 4.\nStep 4: Since we have the equation d - c = 4, we can rewrite it as d = c + 4. We will substitute this expression for d in the equation a + c = 26, and also in other applicable equations.\nStep 5: Substitute 'd' as 'c + 4' into the equation a + c = 26 and we also have d = c + 4 to substitute in the system of equations 'a + b = 22' and 'c + d = 30' becomes a + c + c + 4 = 30 and a + b = 22 and the simplified system of equations will look like a + c + c + 4 = 30, b + c = 26 and a + b = 22. This can be simplified to a + 2c + 4 = 30, b + c = 26, and a + b = 22. Next, we can solve the first and the third equations simultaneously to find the values of 'a' and 'c'.\nStep 6: We will subtract the equation 'a + b = 22' from the equation 'a + 2c + 4 = 30' to eliminate 'a' and get an equation with only 'c'. This will help us solve for 'c'. So, (a + 2c + 4) - (a + b) = 30 - 22. Simplifying, we get 2c + 4 - b = 8.\nStep 7: Since we need to solve for 'c', we can rearrange the equation 2c + 4 - b = 8 by isolating the variable 'c'. First, subtract 4 from both sides to get 2c - b = 4. Next, add 'b' to both sides and then divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'c', resulting in c = (b + 4) / 2. We will substitute this expression for 'c' into the equation b + c = 26 to solve for 'b'.\nStep 8: Substitute 'c' as '(b + 4) / 2' into the equation b + c = 26. This gives us b + (b + 4) / 2 = 26. Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2b + (b + 4) = 52. This simplifies to 3b + 4 = 52. Subtract 4 from both sides to get 3b = 48. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for 'b': b = 16. We can substitute this value of 'b' back into the equation 'b + c = 26' to find the value of 'c'. So, 16 + c = 26. Subtract 16 from both sides to get c = 10.\nStep 9: Now that we have the values of 'b' and 'c', we can substitute 'c' as '10' into the equation 'c + d = 30' to find the value of 'd'. This gives us 10 + d = 30. Subtract 10 from both sides to get d = 20. \n\nStep 10: To find the total length of the trail, we can now substitute the values of 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' back into the system of equations and find a + b + c + d. However, we actually have all the variables now, and from a + c = 26 and c = 10, we can easily determine 'a'. So, a + 10 = 26. Subtract 10 from both sides to get a = 16. Now that we have all the variables, the length of the trail is simply a + b + c + d = 16 + 16 + 10 + 20.\nStep 11: Add the values of 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' to find the total length of the trail: a + b + c + d = 16 + 16 + 10 + 20 = 62.\n$\\boxed{62}$",

Considering this equation 4 and equation 2 are very very similar we now understand what is going on, starting anew we now understand there are two avenues for this one of the which involves only step 3 and this could be primal and simplistic e.g. equation 1 and so only. In any case subtracting equation 2 from equation 4 we get a and c e.g. a - b + c - c = 26 - 26 and rearranging terms leaves us with and yields a = 0 which is not an option for Phoenix as she did indeed hike 4 days.
