    "problem": "The third and fourth terms of a geometric sequence are 12 and 16, respectively. What is the first term of the sequence?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence. Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$. Solving, we have $a\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",

Given that the third term is 12 and the fourth term is 16, we have:\nar^2 = 12 \nar^3 = 16\nDivide the equation ar^3 = 16 by the equation ar^2 = 12 to solve for r:\n(r^3)/(r^2) = 16/12 \nr = 16/12 \nr = 4/3\nThe equation for the third term was ar^2 = 12.  We can substitute the value of r into this equation:\na(4/3)^2 = 12\na(16/9) = 12\nTo solve for 'a', multiply both sides of the equation a(16/9) = 12 by 9/16: \n(9/16) * a(16/9) = (9/16) * 12 \nThis simplifies to: \na = 54/16\nTo simplify the fraction a = 54/16, divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2, resulting in a = 27/8.\nNow that we have the value of 'a' as 27/8, we can conclude that the first term of the geometric sequence is 27/8.\nNow that we have the value of 'a' as 27/8, we can conclude that the first term of the geometric sequence is 27/8.",
