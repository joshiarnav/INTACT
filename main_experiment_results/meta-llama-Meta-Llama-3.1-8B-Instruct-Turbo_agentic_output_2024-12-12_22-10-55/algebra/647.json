    "problem": "The vertex of the parabola described by the equation $y=-3x^2-30x-81$ is $(m,n)$. What is $n$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We will complete the square on the given quadratic expression to find the vertex. Factoring $-3$ from the first two terms, we have \\[y=-3(x^2+10x)-81\\]In order to make the expression inside the parentheses a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(10/2)^2=25$ inside the parentheses. Doing this, we get \\[y=-3(x^2+10x+25-25)-81 = -3(x+5)^2-6\\]The graph of an equation of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ is a parabola with vertex at $(h,k)$, so the vertex of our parabola is at $(-5,-6)$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{-6}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the vertex of the parabola, we will first rewrite the given equation in vertex form, $y=a(x-h)^2+k$.\n\nStep 1: Complete the square on the given quadratic equation $y=-3x^2-30x-81$ to begin rewriting it in vertex form.\nStep 2: First, factor out the coefficient of $x^2$, which is -3, from the quadratic and the linear term to obtain $y=-3(x^2+10x)-81$. Then add and subtract the square of half of the coefficient of the linear term, $5^2=25$, within the parenthesis, resulting in $y=-3(x^2+10x+25-25)-81$. This simplifies to $y=-3((x+5)^2-25)-81$. Further simplification leads to $y=-3(x+5)^2+75-81$, which can be rewritten as $y=-3(x+5)^2-6$.\nNow that we have the equation in the form $y=-3(x+5)^2-6$, we can see that the vertex form of the parabola is given by $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the parabola. Therefore, the vertex is at $(-5, -6)$. We are asked to find the value of $n$, which is the $y$-coordinate of the vertex.\nSince the vertex of the parabola is $(-5, -6)$, we can determine that the value of $n$, which is the $y$-coordinate of the vertex, is $\\boxed{-6}$.",
