Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.",

From the diagram, label the center of the circle as 'O', the two points of intersection of the circle and the square as 'A' and 'B', and the midpoint of segment 'AB' as 'M'. Given that 'AB' is a side of the square and 'OM' is the radius of the circle, 'AM' is half the length of 'AB'.\nStep 3:  Since we know 'AM' is half the length of 'AB', and the triangle 'ABO' is a right triangle, by the Pythagorean Theorem, $AB^2 = AM^2 + AO^2$. We also know that 'AM' is half the length of 'AB' and that 'AB' is equal in length to the radius of the circle, so 'AM' is equal to the radius of the circle divided by 2. Additionally, 'AO' is just the radius of the circle. Let's use 'r' to denote the radius of the circle.\nStep 4: Plug in the given values into the equation $AB^2 = AM^2 + AO^2$. This gives us $AB^2 = (\\frac{r}{2})^2 + r^2$. Simplifying the equation, we get $AB^2 = \\frac{r^2}{4} + r^2$.\nStep 5: To simplify the equation $AB^2 = \\frac{r^2}{4} + r^2$ further, we can find a common denominator. Multiplying $\\frac{r^2}{4}$ by $\\frac{4}{4}$ gives us $AB^2 = \\frac{r^2}{4} + \\frac{4r^2}{4}$. Combining the two terms, we get $AB^2 = \\frac{5r^2}{4}$.

Taking the square root of both sides, we get $AB = \\sqrt{\\frac{5r^2}{4}}$. Simplifying this further, we have $AB = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}r$.\nStep 7! Now that we know the length of the side of the square is $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}r$, we need to find the area of the square and the area of the circle, and then find the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle.!\nStep 7: Calculate the area of the square and the area of the circle.

Simplifying this equation gives us $3r^2/4 = r^2$, which allows us to solve for $r$. By cross-multiplying, we obtain $3r^2 = 4r^2$, and dividing both sides by $r^2$ gives $3 = 4$, which is a contradiction, indicating that the initial assumption that the triangle 'ABO' is a right triangle is not valid. However, since we know the triangle is not a right triangle but also cannot be an isosceles right triangle (3r/2< r because of the triangle inequality theorem), then the square must have a side length of the square root of 3 times the radius of the circle, because it intersects at the circle at a point that makes the triangle with the point of the square and the intersections of the circle also almost a 30-60-90 triangle, with the angle at point A being between 30 and 60 degrees.",
