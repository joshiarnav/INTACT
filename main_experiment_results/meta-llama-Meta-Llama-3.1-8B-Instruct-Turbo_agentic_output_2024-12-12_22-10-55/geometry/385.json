    "solution": "Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of the prism, we need to multiply the length, width, and height. \n\nSince the side, front, and bottom faces have areas 15, 10, and 6 square inches respectively, let's call the three dimensions of the prism:\n\n- Length: l\n- Width: w\n- Height: h\n\nStep 1: We can set up equations based on the areas of the faces. The area of the side face is lw = 15, the area of the front face is lh = 10, and the area of the bottom face is wh = 6. \n\nFrom here, we can proceed with solving the equations to find the dimensions and then the volume.\nStep 2: To find the dimensions, we can divide the equations to eliminate two variables. Dividing the equation lw = 15 by lh = 10, we get w/ h = 15 / 10, which simplifies to w/ h = 3/2. \n\nWe can also divide the equation wh = 6 by lw = 15, giving us h/ l = 6 / 15, which simplifies to h/ l = 2/5. \n\nNow we have the relationships w/ h = 3/2 and h/ l = 2/5. We can rearrange these to get h = (2/5)l and w = (3/2)h = (9/10)l.\nStep 3: Substitute the expressions for h and w into the equation lw = 15. We have lw = 15, and we know that w = (9/10)l and h = (2/5)l. Substituting w = (9/10)l into lw = 15, we get l * (9/10)l = 15. Simplifying this, we get (9/10)l^2 = 15.\nStep 4: Multiply both sides by 10/9 to isolate l^2. This results in l^2 = 15 * (10/9), which simplifies to l^2 = 50/3. We can then take the square root of both sides to solve for l: l = \u221a(50/3).\nStep 5: Now that we have the value of l, we can substitute it back into the expression h = (2/5)l to find the value of h. \nh = (2/5) * \u221a(50/3)\nAfter finding the values of l and h, we can substitute these into the equation wh = 6 to solve for w. \nw = 6 / h\nUsing the values of h in terms of l, we can further simplify this to find w in terms of l.\nStep 6: Now that we have the values of l and h in terms of l, we can calculate their squared and multiplied values. Substituting h = (2/5)\u221a(50/3) into wh = 6, we get w = 6 / [(2/5)\u221a(50/3)]. Simplifying this to find w in terms of l is not necessary as we can directly substitute the values of l and h into the equation for volume to get the final answer. \n\nWe know that volume = lwh. Substituting w = (9/10)l, h = (2/5)\u221a(50/3), and l into the volume equation gives us the volume in cubic inches.\nStep 7: Substitute the expressions for l, w, and h into the equation volume = lwh. We get volume = l * (9/10)l * (2/5)\u221a(50/3). Multiply the terms together and simplify to find the volume in cubic inches. \n\nvolume = (9/10) * (2/5) * (\u221a(50/3)) * l * l = (18/50) * (\u221a(50/3)) * l^2 \n\nSubstitute l^2 = 50/3 back into the equation to solve for the volume. \nvolume = (18/50) * (\u221a(50/3)) * (50/3)\nStep 8: Simplify the expression for volume by multiplying the terms together and canceling out common factors. \nvolume = (18/50) * (\u221a(50/3)) * (50/3) \nSimplifying this expression results in volume = (\u221a(50/3)) * (3/5) * (10/1), \nwhich further simplifies to volume = \u221a(50/3) * (6/5). \n\nvolume = (\u221a(25*2/3)) * (6/5) \nUsing the property of square roots that \u221a(ab) = \u221aa * \u221ab, we can rewrite the expression as \nvolume = \u221a25 * \u221a2 * \u221a3 * (6/5) which simplifies to 5\u221a6.\nStep 9: Simplify the expression for volume to get the final answer. \nWe have volume = (\u221a25 * \u221a2 * \u221a3 * (6/5)) which simplifies to 5\u221a6.\nSince we have found the volume of the prism in step 9, the final step is to state the solution.\n\n$\\boxed{5\u221a6}$",
