    "solution": "There must be four rays emanating from $X$ that intersect the four corners of the square region. Depending on the location of $X$, the number of rays distributed among these four triangular sectors will vary. We start by finding the corner-most point that is $100$-ray partitional (let this point be the bottom-left-most point).\nWe first draw the four rays that intersect the vertices. At this point, the triangular sectors with bases as the sides of the square that the point is closest to both do not have rays dividing their areas. Therefore, their heights are equivalent since their areas are equal. The remaining $96$ rays are divided among the other two triangular sectors, each sector with $48$ rays, thus dividing these two sectors into $49$ triangles of equal areas.\nLet the distance from this corner point to the closest side be $a$ and the side of the square be $s$. From this, we get the equation $\\frac{a\\times s}{2}=\\frac{(s-a)\\times s}{2}\\times\\frac1{49}$. Solve for $a$ to get $a=\\frac s{50}$. Therefore, point $X$ is $\\frac1{50}$ of the side length away from the two sides it is closest to. By moving $X$ $\\frac s{50}$ to the right, we also move one ray from the right sector to the left sector, which determines another $100$-ray partitional point. We can continue moving $X$ right and up to derive the set of points that are $100$-ray partitional.\nIn the end, we get a square grid of points each $\\frac s{50}$ apart from one another. Since this grid ranges from a distance of $\\frac s{50}$ from one side to $\\frac{49s}{50}$ from the same side, we have a $49\\times49$ grid, a total of $2401$ $100$-ray partitional points. To find the overlap from the $60$-ray partitional, we must find the distance from the corner-most $60$-ray partitional point to the sides closest to it. Since the $100$-ray partitional points form a $49\\times49$ grid, each point $\\frac s{50}$ apart from each other, we can deduce that the $60$-ray partitional points form a $29\\times29$ grid, each point $\\frac s{30}$ apart from each other. To find the overlap points, we must find the common divisors of $30$ and $50$ which are $1, 2, 5,$ and $10$. Therefore, the overlapping points will form grids with points $s$, $\\frac s{2}$, $\\frac s{5}$, and $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other respectively. Since the grid with points $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other includes the other points, we can disregard the other grids. The total overlapping set of points is a $9\\times9$ grid, which has $81$ points. Subtract $81$ from $2401$ to get $2401-81=\\boxed{2320}$.",

Without loss of generality, let's call the upper-right triangle formed by the point $X$, with the center of the square, and the top-right corner of the square as the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle, triangle Q.\n\nSince the triangle Q shares an angle and a side with the entire square, the triangle Q is similar to the entire square.\nSince the triangle $Q$ shares an angle and a side with the entire square, the triangle $Q$ is similar to the entire square, and we can compute the length of the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle as $l = \\sqrt{2}x$, since the sides of the square are of length 1.\n\nNow, we must find an expression for the area of the triangle Q which is similar to the square and we have done so this must equal $\\frac{1}{n}$ times the area of the square this can be written as $ \\frac{(x)(1 - x)}{2} = \\frac{1}{n}.$\n\nNow, solve for $x$\nWe start by solving the equation for $x$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{(x)(1-x)}{2} &= \\frac{1}{n}\\\\\nx(1-x) &= \\frac{2}{n}\\\\\nx - x^2 &= \\frac{2}{n}\\\\\n0 &= x^2 - x + \\frac{2}{n}\n\\end{align*}\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a},$$ where $a = 1, b = -1,$ and $c = \\frac{2}{n}.$ Plug in these values:\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(2/n)}}{2(1)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{8}{n}}}{2}\n\\end{align*}\nSo we have two solutions for x. Now, we just need to find the points that are $100$-ray partitional but not $60$-ray partitional.\nTo find the points that are $100$-ray partitional but not $60$-ray partitional, we need to find the values of $x$ that are solutions to the equation $x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{8}{n}}}{2}$ when $n = 100$ and when $n = 60$. If $x$ is a solution for $n = 100$ but is not a solution for $n = 60$, then that point is $100$-ray partitional but not $60$-ray partitional. \n\nThe next step is to find the number of such points in the unit square region.\nTo find the number of points that are $100$-ray partitional but not $60$-ray partitional, we need to find the points in the unit square region that satisfy the equation $$x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{8}{n}}}{2}$$ when $n = 100$ but do not satisfy it when $n = 60$.\n\nWe first consider the case where $n = 100$ and find the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation.

Since each point $X$ has a corresponding vertical line and horizontal line passing through it, we need to count the number of points that lie on these lines. \n\nWe will count the points that lie on these vertical and horizontal lines.\nTo count the points that lie on the vertical and horizontal lines, we consider the four cases where $x = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{92}}{20}$ and $x = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{92}}{20}.$\n\nFor the case where $x = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{92}}{20},$ the points $X$ that satisfy the equation will lie on the vertical lines $x = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{92}}{20}$ and $x = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{92}}{20}.$\n\nSimilarly, for the case where $x = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{92}}{20},$ the points $X$ that satisfy the equation will lie on the vertical lines $x = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{92}}{20}$ and $x = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{92}}{20}.$\n\nThis gives us a total of $4$ vertical lines.\n\nFor each of these $4$ vertical lines, the points $X$ that satisfy the equation will lie on the horizontal lines $y = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{92}}{20}$ and $y = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{92}}{20}.$\n\nSimilarly, for each of the $4$ vertical lines, the points $X$ that satisfy the equation will lie on the horizontal lines $y =\nThe next step is to determine the number of intersection points between the vertical and horizontal lines where the points $X$ that satisfy the equation lie.\n\nFor each of the $4$ vertical lines, there are $2$ horizontal lines where the points $X$ that satisfy the equation lie. Each point $X$ in the intersection of a vertical line and a horizontal line will have a corresponding $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate. The $x$-coordinate is constant for all points on the vertical line, while the $y$-coordinate is constant for all points on the horizontal line. \n\nTherefore, the number of points $X$ in the unit square region that satisfy the equation for $n = 100$ is $4 \\cdot 2 = 8$.\n\nNow we need to find the number of points that are not $60$-ray partitional. \n\nIf a point $X$ in the unit square region satisfies the equation for $n = 100$ but not for $n = 60$, then it must be that the point $X$ has an $x$-coordinate where $n = 100$ but does not have an $x$-coordinate where $n = 60$.\n\nWe can calculate the values of $x$ when $n = 60$ in the same way as before:\n\n$$x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{8}{60}}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{52}{60}}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{52}}{10}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pm\nThe values of $x$ when $n = 60$ are:\n\n$$x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{52}}{10}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{10}.$$\n\nWe now need to find the number of points with these $x$-coordinates in the unit square region.\n\nThe points $X$ that satisfy the equation for $n = 100$ but not for $n = 60$ are the points with $x$-coordinates in the interval $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{92}}{20}, \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{10}\\right)$ or $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{10}, \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{92}}{20}\\right)$.\n\nWe can find the number of intersection points between the vertical lines and the horizontal lines within these intervals.\n\nThe interval $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{92}}{20}, \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{10}\\right)$ contains $8$ intersection points.\n\nThe interval $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{10}, \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{92}}{20}\\right)$ contains $8$ intersection points.\n\nTherefore, the total number of points that are $100$-ray partitional but not $60$-ray partitional is $\\boxed{2320}$",
