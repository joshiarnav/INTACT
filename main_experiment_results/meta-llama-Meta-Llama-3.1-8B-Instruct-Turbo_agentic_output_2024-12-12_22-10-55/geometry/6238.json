    "solution": "Since $C$ is the trisector of line segment $\\overline{AB}$ closer to $A$, the $y$-coordinate of $C$ is equal to two thirds the $y$-coordinate of $A$ plus one third the $y$-coordinate of $B$. Thus, point $C$ has coordinates $(x_0, \\frac{2}{3} \\ln 1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\ln 1000) = (x_0, \\ln 10)$ for some $x_0$. Then the horizontal line through $C$ has equation $y = \\ln 10$, and this intersects the curve $y = \\ln x$ at the point $(10, \\ln 10)$, so $x_3 = \\boxed{10}$.",
