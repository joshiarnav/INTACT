    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We let our integer be $n$.  the first sentence tells us that  \\[n\\equiv 7\\pmod {15}.\\] Since 3 and 5 are both factors of 15 we deduce \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv2\\pmod5.\n\\end{align*} Therefore the remainders in question are 1 and 2, and their sum is $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem:\n\nGiven: The integer leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 15.\n\nStep 1: Write the given information as an equation. Since the integer leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 15, we can express it as:\n\nn = 15q + 7\n\nwhere n is the integer and q is an integer quotient.\nStep 2: Recognize that since 15 = 3 * 5, a number that leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 15 will also leave some remainders when divided by 3 and 5. Consider the effect of the divisor and quotient on remainders.\nStep 3: Use the equation n = 15q + 7 and divide both sides by 3 and by 5 to find expressions for the remainders when n is divided by 3 and by 5, respectively. When divided by 3, 15q is always divisible by 3 with a quotient of 5q, and 7 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. So the remainder when n is divided by 3 is 1. Similarly, when divided by 5, 15q is always divisible by 5 with a quotient of 3q, and 7 divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 2. So the remainder when n is divided by 5 is 2. The sum of the remainders is 1 + 2 =\n$\\boxed{3}$",
