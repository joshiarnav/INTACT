    "solution": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7. So the residue of the sum is  $$\n182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\equiv \\boxed{10} \\pmod{14}.\n$$",

Then, we notice that $182$ and $14$ have a common factor, as $182 = 13\\cdot 14$. Similarly, the term $15$ in $15\\cdot 7$ is not divisible by 14, but $7$ and $14$ share a factor of 7, though not the complete common factor of 14. The term $3$ does not share any common factors with $14$, and is thus independent of it in this expansion. Therefore, we can simplify the expression as follows:\n\n$182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 = (13\\cdot 14)\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3$\nNow, we can distribute the multiplication to simplify the expression further: \n\n$(13\\cdot 14)\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 = 13\\cdot 14\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3$\nNow, we notice that $14$ is a common factor in the term $13\\cdot 14\\cdot 12$, so we can simplify the expression by factoring out $14$.
