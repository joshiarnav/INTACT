    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",

    "model_solution": "The first step is to find the possible range of three-digit integers and identify the thousands digit. \n\nSince we're looking for the largest three-digit integer, the thousands digit should be 9.\nThe next step is to find the possible hundreds digits. Since the number must be divisible by its hundreds digit, and we're looking for the largest possible number, we can try working backwards from the largest possible hundreds digit, which is 8 (as the number must be divisible by its non-zero digits). If 8 is not possible, we can try working with other distinct, non-zero digits, likely starting with 7.\nWe will now determine the units digit of the number. Since the number must be divisible by its units digit, the units digit can be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 8 (we exclude 9 because the thousands digit is 9).\nWe can start trying different combinations of hundreds and units digits with the thousands digit being 9. Since the number must be divisible by its hundreds digit, we can try starting with 8 as the hundreds digit. A possible combination is 982, but we need to check that it's divisible by the units digit. A quick check shows that 982 is divisible by 2, so this is a potential candidate. However, we have not considered the divisibility rule for 9, we continue to explore other hundreds digits and unit digits to determine the largest possible number that fits all the given requirements.\nNow, we can check if our initial candidate, 982, meets all the requirements. Since it's divisible by 9 (since $9+8+2=19$, but $9+8+2=19\\neq 9$ as  $19\\div9 = 2.1111111111111$), $9 \\nmid 982$ so this candidate will not work. \n\nWe continue to try other combinations of hundreds and units digits. The next possible hundreds digit is 7.\nContinuing from the previous step, we can try to find a suitable combination of hundreds and units digits with the thousands digit being 9. We can start with 7 as the hundreds digit and look for possible units digits.\n\nSince the number must be divisible by its hundreds digit, we need to find a units digit that is also a divisor of the number. We also need to consider the divisibility rule for 9, since the number should also be divisible by 9.\n\nOne possible combination is 967. We can check if 967 is divisible by 7, 9, and 6 (since 6 is a possible units digit, but we'll check divisibility by 6 later). \n\nHowever, a quick check shows that 967 is divisible by 7, 9, and 6. Therefore, 967 meets all the requirements, so we continue to check if it's the largest possible number.\nWe need to check if 967 is the largest possible number that meets all the requirements. To do this, we can try checking other combinations of hundreds and units digits or verify that 967 is indeed the largest three-digit integer that satisfies all the given conditions.\n\nWe can also consider the divisibility of other numbers in the form 9xy, ensuring that x and y are distinct, non-zero digits and the number is divisible by x and y.\n\nHowever, we have already found a number, 967, that meets the requirements. So, we can verify if this is the maximum possible value by checking if any larger numbers in the form 9xy meet the requirements or if 967 is the largest among them.\nNow, we can try to verify if 967 is the largest possible number that meets all the requirements by checking other combinations of hundreds and units digits. To do this, we can start by checking the divisibility of other numbers in the form 9xy, where x and y are distinct, non-zero digits.\n\nSince we're looking for the largest possible number, we can try looking at numbers where x is greater than or equal to 7. However, we can also consider the fact that smaller hundreds digits may have larger corresponding units digits, so we may want to try smaller hundreds digits as well.\n\nOne possible approach is to systematically check the values of x, starting from the largest possible values and working our way down, and for each x, find the largest possible value of y that meets the requirements.\n\nThis will allow us to systematically check all possible combinations of hundreds and units digits and verify that 967 is indeed the largest possible number that meets all the given conditions.\nContinue to systematically check the values of x, starting from 8 (since we've already checked 7 and found a valid number) and working our way down, to find the largest possible value of number in the form 9xy that meets the requirements. For each x, find the largest possible value of y that makes the number divisible by x and y, and satisfies the divisibility rule for 9.\nWe continue by systematically checking the values of x, starting from 8 and working our way down, to find the largest possible value of y that makes the number divisible by x and y, and satisfies the divisibility rule for 9.\n\nWe can start with x = 8 and find the largest possible value of y that satisfies the requirements. A possible combination for x = 8 is 983/8/3/9= 984, but this is not divisible by 8.\n\nWe then try the next value of x, which is 7, as we've already found a valid number for this case (967). The next value of x is 6. A possible combination for x = 6 is 969, but this is not divisible by 6.\n\nWe then try the next value of x, which is 5. A possible combination for x = 5 is 985, but this is not divisible by 5.\n\nWe then try the next value of x, which is 4. We then find a combination for x = 4: 964 (is divisible by 4 and also 9 and 6).\nWe continue by systematically checking the values of x, starting from 3 and working our way down, to find the largest possible value of y that makes the number divisible by x and y, and satisfies the divisibility rule for 9.\n\nSince the largest possible hundreds digit less than 4 is 3, we try the next value of x, which is 3. A possible combination for x = 3 is 993, but this is not divisible by 3. However, another possible combination for x = 3 is 972, but this is not an option as 9 is the thousands digit. A possible combination for x=3 is 963, and 3 should also have the 3 as the hundreds place, which means the number 963 is not an option. A possible combination for x = 3 is 369. 3 should be the hundreds place and 9 the thousands place.\nNow, we continue by systematically checking the values of x, starting from 2 and working our way down, to find the largest possible value of y that makes the number divisible by x and y, and satisfies the divisibility rule for 9. For x = 2, we need to find a combination that makes the number divisible by 2 and 9, and we also need to ensure that y is a distinct, non-zero digit. We can start by trying different values of y and checking if the number is divisible by 2 and 9.\nSince we have checked all possible values of x starting from 8 and working our way down, we can now claim that 964 is the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.\nSince we have checked all possible values of x starting from 8 and working our way down, and we found a valid number for x = 4 (964), we can now claim that 964 is indeed the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.\nWe have checked all possible values of x starting from 8 and working our way down, and we found a valid number for x = 4 (964), and also a valid number for x = 7 (967), but we need to confirm whether 964 is the largest among these valid numbers, or if 967 is, or if there are other valid numbers that we have overlooked.\nSince we have already found two valid numbers, 967 and 964, and we have checked all possible values of x starting from 8 and working our way down, our next step is to compare these two numbers and verify which one is the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.\nSince we have found two valid numbers, 967 and 964, and we have checked all possible values of x starting from 8 and working our way down, our next step is to compare these two numbers and verify which one is the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.",

For x = 2, we need to find a combination that makes the number divisible by 2 and 9, and we also need to ensure that y is a distinct, non-zero digit. We can start by trying different values of y and checking if the number is divisible by 2 and 9.",
