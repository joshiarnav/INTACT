    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 10\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 12\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 10+4+12 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $24$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's start with the given information: \n\nThree positive integers are divided by $24$, resulting in remainders of $10,$ $4,$ and $12$, respectively.\n\nStep 1: We can represent the three integers as $24a + 10$, $24b + 4$, and $24c + 12$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are non-negative integers.\nStep 2: We are asked to find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24. We can express the sum as $(24a + 10) + (24b + 4) + (24c + 12)$.\nStep 3: Simplify the expression for the sum by combining like terms. This will involve adding the constants (10, 4, and 12) and grouping the terms that involve the variable (24a, 24b, and 24c). This can be expressed as $(24a + 24b + 24c) + (10 + 4 + 12)$.\nStep 4: Factor out the common term $24$ from the grouped terms to simplify the expression further. This gives: $24(a + b + c) + 26$.\nStep 5: Since we are looking for the remainder when the sum of the integers is divided by 24, we can disregard the term $24(a + b + c)$ because it is a multiple of 24. We are left with $26$, which is equivalent to $24 + 2$ modulo 24. Therefore, the remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
