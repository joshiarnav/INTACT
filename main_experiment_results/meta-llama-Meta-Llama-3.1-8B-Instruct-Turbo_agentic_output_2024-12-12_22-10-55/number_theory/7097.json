            "To verify that the given solution satisfies the second condition $\\quad\\bullet\\ m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$, let's substitute $m = 2^3 = 8$ and $n = 7$ into the condition. We need to show that $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$. \n\nSince $m^m = 8^8$ and $n^n = 7^7$, we need to find the power of $7^7$ that divides $8^8$. To do this, we can write $8^8$ as $(2^3)^8 = 2^{24}$. Then the power of $7^7$ that divides $2^{24}$ is given by $2 \\cdot 3 = 6,$ which is less than $7,$ so the power of $7^7$ that divides $2^{24}$ must be $7 \\cdot 6 = 42,$ or the $7$ that is in the factor of $7^7$ that can be factored out of $m^m$ which is $2^{24}$.\n\nSince $n = 7$, we have the factor of $7^7$ needed in the factor of $m^m$, which is $m^m,$ which means that $m^m$ must be divisible by $7^{42}.$ Since $7^{42}$ must be a factor of the power that can be factored out of $m^m,$ we have that $7^{42}$ must be the factor that can be factored out of $m^m$ $\\quad\\bullet\\ m^m$ is a multiple",

We get \n$$m^m = (2^3)^{2^3} = 2^{2^3 \\cdot 3}$$ \nand \n$$n^n = 7^7,$$ \nand we see that $n^n \\nmid m^m$. We must also check that $m^m \\nmid n^n$.",
