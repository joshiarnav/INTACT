    "problem": "There is a committee composed of eight women and two men. When they meet, they sit in a row---the women in indistinguishable rocking chairs and the men on indistinguishable stools.  How many distinct ways are there for me to arrange the eight chairs and two stools for a meeting?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Because the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from each other and the stools are indistinguishable from each other, we can think of first placing the two stools somewhere in the ten slots and then filling the rest with rocking chairs. The first stool has $10$ slots in which it can go, and the second has $9$. However, because they are indistinguishable from each other, we have overcounted the number of ways to place the stools by a factor of $2$, so we divide by $2$. Thus, there are $\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = \\boxed{45}$ distinct ways to arrange the ten chairs and stools for a meeting.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will use combinations. The first step is to choose the positions for the two stools among the ten available seats (8 rocking chairs + 2 stools), which can be calculated using combinations as follows:\n\nChoose 2 positions out of 10:\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10 - 2)!)\n= 10! / (2! * 8!)\n= (10 * 9) / 2\n= 45\nThe next step is to acknowledge that once the positions of the two stools are chosen, the remaining eight positions will be occupied by the eight indistinguishable rocking chairs. Since the order of the chairs does not matter, we simply need to consider the arrangement of the two stools in their chosen positions.\n\nHowever, since the two stools are also indistinguishable, the number of ways to arrange the two stools in these positions is simply 1 (as there is only one way to arrange identical items). \n\nTherefore, multiply the number of ways to choose the positions for the two stools by 1 to get the total number of distinct arrangements:\n\n45 * 1 = 45\nThe total number of distinct ways is $\\boxed{45}$.",
