    "problem": "Chloe wants to buy a hoodie that costs $\\$32.75$. She empties her wallet and finds she only has three $\\$10$ bills, eight quarters, and a pile of dimes. What is the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $n$ represent the unknown number of dimes. Chloe's total amount of money is $$3(\\$10)+8(\\$.25)+n(\\$.10) \\ge \\$32.75.$$Simplifying gives  \\begin{align*}\n30+2+.10n &\\ge 32.75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\n.10n &\\ge .75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge \\frac{.75}{.10} \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge 7.5.\n\\end{align*}Chloe must have at least $\\boxed{8}$ dimes in her pile.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Determine how much money Chloe already has from the three $10 bills and eight quarters. The total value from the $10 bills is $10 x 3 = $30. The total value from the quarters is $0.25 x 8 = $2.  The combined value of the three $10 bills and eight quarters is $30 + $2 = $32.\nStep 2: Calculate the remaining amount Chloe needs to reach the cost of the hoodie, which is $\\$32.75$ - $\\$32$ = $\\$0.75$.\nStep 3: To find the minimum number of dimes Chloe must have, determine how many dimes are needed to equal \\$0.75. Since each dime is worth \\$.10, we can divide the remaining amount \\$0.75 by \\$0.10 to get the minimum number of dimes. \\$0.75 \u00f7 \\$0.10 = 7.5.
