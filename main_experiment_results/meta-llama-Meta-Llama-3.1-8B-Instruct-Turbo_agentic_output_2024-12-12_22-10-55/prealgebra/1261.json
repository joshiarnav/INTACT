Since $20\\%$ of $x$ equals $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$, we can set up the equation: $0.20x = P\\%$ of $x$, where $P$ is the percent of $x$ we are looking for.\nWe can solve for P by isolating it in the equation $0.20x = P\\%$ of $x$. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by $0.20x$ to get $\\frac{0.20x}{x} = \\frac{P\\% of x}{x}$, which simplifies to $0.20 = \\frac{P}{100}$.\nTo find the value of P, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 100 to get P = 0.20 * 100.\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 100 to get P = 0.20 * 100, which simplifies to P = 20.\nDivide the value of P by 1 to express it as a percentage in its simplest form.\nDivide the value of P by 1 to express it as a percentage in its simplest form.",
