    "solution": "First, quantify the number of marbles each person has:\n\n$\\bullet$ Angela has $a$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Brian has $2\\times a$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Caden has $3\\times(2\\times a)$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Daryl has $5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))$ marbles.\n\nIn total, the four people have $a+2\\times a+3\\times(2\\times a)+5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))$ marbles. And that expression equals 78, since in total the four people have 78 marbles. Now evaluate the resulting equation. \\begin{align*}\n78&=a+2\\times a+3\\times(2\\times a)+5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))\\\\\n&=a+2a+3(2a)+5(3(2a))\\\\\n&=a+2a+6a+5(6a)\\\\\n&=a+2a+6a+30a\\\\\n&=39a \\quad\\implies\\\\\na&=\\boxed{2}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step. \n\nStep 1: Define the relationships between the number of marbles each person has. We can represent the number of marbles each person has in terms of 'a', which is the number of marbles Angela has:\n- Brian has twice as many marbles as Angela: b = 2a\n- Caden has three times as many marbles as Brian: c = 3b = 3(2a) = 6a\n- Daryl has five times the number of marbles Caden has: d = 5c = 5(6a) = 30a\nStep 2: The total number of marbles the four people have is the sum of their individual marbles, which is 78. We can write this as an equation: a + 2a + 6a + 30a = 78\nStep 3: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation to find a simplified equation. We can rewrite the equation as: 39a = 78\nStep 4: Solve for 'a' by dividing both sides of the equation by 39, giving us the value of a: a = 78 / 39 = 2\nStep 5: Confirm that the value of 'a' we found is correct by checking that it satisfies the original equation and that each person has a whole number of marbles.\nStep 5: Confirm that the value of 'a' we found is correct by plugging it back into the relationships between the number of marbles each person has. If a = 2, then:\n- Brian has 2a = 2(2) = 4 marbles\n- Caden has 6a = 6(2) = 12 marbles\n- Daryl has 30a = 30(2) = 60 marbles\nChecking that a + 2a + 6a + 30a = 2 + 4 + 12 + 60 = 78, we can confirm that a = 2 is the correct solution.\nStep 5: Confirm that the value of 'a' we found is correct by checking that it satisfies the original equation and that each person has a whole number of marbles.",
