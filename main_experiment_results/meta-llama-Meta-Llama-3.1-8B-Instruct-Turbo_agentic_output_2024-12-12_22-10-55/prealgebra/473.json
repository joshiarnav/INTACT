    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To round $18.4851$ to the nearest hundredth, we must look at the hundreds and the thousands digits of the number in question. Since the thousands digit ($5$) is greater than or equal to $5$, the hundreds digit $8$ rounds up to $9$. Therefore, $18.4851$ rounded to the nearest hundredth is equal to $\\boxed{18.49}$.",

If it is 5 or greater, round up. If it is less than 5, round down. In this case, the digit is 5.\n\nSince it is 5, round up the hundredth place. The new hundredth place is 9 and the digit immediately to the right goes away. The new number is 18.49\nStep 3: \nCheck if any digits to the right of the new hundredth place are 5 or greater. If they are, you must add 1 to the new hundredth place. In this case, the number becomes 18.49.\nStep 4: \nSince the digits to the right of the new hundredth place are all 0 (not 5 or greater), no further rounding is necessary. The final number rounded to the nearest hundredth is 18.49.\nCheck if any digits to the right of the new thousandths place are 5 or greater. If they are, you must add 1 to the new hundredth place.
