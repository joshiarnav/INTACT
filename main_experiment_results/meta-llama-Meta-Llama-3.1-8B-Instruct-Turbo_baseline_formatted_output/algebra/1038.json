    "problem": "What is the greatest integer $n$ such that $n^2 - 11n +24 \\leq 0$?",
    "solution": "We can factor $n^2-11n+24$ as $(n-3)(n-8)$. For this quantity to be less than or equal to 0, one of the factors must be less than or equal to 0 and the other factor must be greater than or equal to 0. Specifically, since $n-8<n-3$ for all $n$, we must have $$n-8 \\le 0 \\le n-3.$$ The first inequality, $n-8\\le 0$, tells us that $n\\le 8$. The second inequality, $0\\le n-3$, tells us that $n\\ge 3$. The solutions to the original inequality must satisfy both conditions, so they are given by $3\\le n\\le 8$. The largest integer in this interval is $n=\\boxed{8}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the greatest integer $n$ such that $n^2 - 11n +24 \\leq 0$, we need to solve the quadratic inequality.\n\nThe quadratic expression $n^2 - 11n +24$ can be factored as:\n\n$n^2 - 11n +24 = (n - 8)(n - 3)$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $n$ for which $(n - 8)(n - 3) \\leq 0$.\n\nThis inequality will be true when either $n - 8 \\leq 0$ and $n - 3 \\geq 0$, or when $n - 8 \\geq 0$ and $n - 3 \\leq 0$.\n\nThe first case gives $n \\leq 8$ and $n \\geq 3$, which is true for all $n$ in the interval $[3, 8]$.\n\nThe second case gives $n \\geq 8$ and $n \\leq 3$, which is not possible since $n \\geq 3$ and $n \\leq 3$ at the same time is not possible.\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is $3 \\leq n \\leq 8$.\n\nThe greatest integer in this interval is $8$. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{8}$"
