We will substitute $x=5$ into the function to find $g(5)$.\n\n$g(5) = 2(5) - 1$\n$g(5) = 10 - 1$\n$g(5) = 9$\n\nNow that we know $g(5) = 9$, we can substitute this value into the function $f(x)$.\n\nThe function $f(x)$ is given as $x^2+1$. We will substitute $x=9$ into the function to find $f(g(5))$.\n\n$f(g(5)) = (9)^2 + 1$\n$f(g(5)) = 81 + 1$\n$f(g(5)) = 82$\n\nTherefore, the value of $f(g(5))$ is $\\boxed{82}$."
