    "problem": "Phoenix hiked the Rocky Path Trail last week. It took four days to complete the trip. The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles. The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day. The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles. The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles. How many miles long was the trail?",
    "solution": "Let the number of miles Phoenix hiked in each day be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=22\\\\\n(b+c)/2=13 \\Rightarrow b+c&=26\\\\\nc+d&=30\\\\\na+c&=26\n\\end{align*} Notice that we do not have to solve for any of the variables. We can add $a + b = 22$ to $c + d = 30$ and find that $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52.$ Therefore, the entire trail was $\\boxed{52}$ miles long.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total length of the trail, we can use the given information to set up a system of equations.\n\nLet's denote the miles hiked on each day as:\n- Day 1: x\n- Day 2: y\n- Day 3: z\n- Day 4: w\n\nGiven:\n1. The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles: x + y = 22\n2. The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day: (y + z) / 2 = 13 => y + z = 26\n3. The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles: z + w = 30\n4. The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles: x + z = 26\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations.\n\nFrom equation 1 and 4, we can find y:\nx + y = 22\nx + z = 26\ny = 22 - x\nz = 26 - x\nSubstituting into equation 2:\n(22 - x) + (26 - x) = 26\n48 - 2x = 26\n-2x = 26 - 48\n-2x = -22\nx = 11\n\nNow that we have x, we can find y:\ny = 22 - x\ny = 22 - 11\ny = 11\n\nNow that we have y, we can find z:\nz = 26 - x\nz = 26 - 11\nz = 15\n\nFinally, we can find w:\nz + w = 30\n15 + w = 30\nw = 30 - 15\nw = 15\n\nNow that we have the miles hiked on each day, we can find the total length of the trail:\nx + y + z + w = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15\nx + y + z + w = 52\n\nTherefore, the total length of the trail is $\\boxed{52}$."
