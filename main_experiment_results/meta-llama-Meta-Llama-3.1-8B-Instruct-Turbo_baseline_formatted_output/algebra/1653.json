    "problem": "A triangular region is bounded by the two coordinate axes and the line given by the equation $2x + y = 6$. What is the area of the region, in square units?",
    "solution": "To start, use the equation to solve for the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the line.  Letting $x$ equal 0, the $y$-intercept is 6.  Letting $y$ equal 0, we find that $2x=6$ so the $x$-intercept is 3.  Using the intercepts, we can graph the line as shown: [asy]size(100,0);\nfill((0,0)--(0,6)--(3,0)--cycle,gray(.7));\nadd(grid(5,8));\ndraw((0,0)--(5,0),linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,8),linewidth(2));\nlabel(\"\",(5,0),E);\nlabel(\"\",(0,8),N);\ndraw((0,6)--(3,0),blue,Arrows);[/asy] We wish to find the area of the shaded region.  This is a right triangle with one base of length 3, and one of length 6.  Therefore, the area is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3\\cdot 6=\\boxed{9}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the triangular region, we need to find the coordinates of its vertices. \n\nFirst, we'll find the x-coordinate of the vertex where the line intersects the x-axis. To do this, we set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n2x + 0 = 6\n2x = 6\nx = 3\n\nNext, we'll find the y-coordinate of the vertex where the line intersects the y-axis. To do this, we set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\n2(0) + y = 6\ny = 6\n\nNow we have the coordinates of the vertices: (0, 0), (3, 0), and (0, 6).\n\nThe base of the triangle is 3 units (the distance between (0, 0) and (3, 0)), and the height is 6 units (the distance between (0, 0) and (0, 6)).\n\nThe area of the triangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = (base \u00d7 height) / 2\n= (3 \u00d7 6) / 2\n= 18 / 2\n= 9\n\nSo the area of the region is 9 square units.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{9}$."
