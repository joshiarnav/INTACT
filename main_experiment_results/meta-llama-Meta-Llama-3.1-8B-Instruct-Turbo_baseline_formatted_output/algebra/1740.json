    "problem": "A box with a volume of 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold 50 paperclips. How many paperclips could a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ hold?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of paperclips that a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ could hold. Setting up the ratio $\\frac{50}{16}=\\frac{x}{48}$ and solving for $x$ gives $x=150$.  Hence, a 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ box could hold $\\boxed{150}$ paperclips.  We also could have noted that tripling the size of the box triples the number of paperclips we can hold, so the new box can hold $50\\cdot 3 = 150$ paperclips.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of paperclips the larger box can hold, we need to determine the ratio of the volumes of the two boxes. \n\nThe ratio of the larger box's volume to the smaller box's volume is $\\frac{48\\ \\text{cm}^3}{16\\ \\text{cm}^3} = 3.$\n\nSince the smaller box holds 50 paperclips, the larger box should hold 3 times as many paperclips. Therefore, the number of paperclips the larger box can hold is $50\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{150}$ paperclips."
