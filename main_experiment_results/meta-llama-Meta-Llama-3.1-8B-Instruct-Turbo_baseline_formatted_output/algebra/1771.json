    "problem": "Two parabolas are the graphs of the equations $y=2x^2-7x+1$ and $y=8x^2+5x+1$. Give all points where they intersect.  List the points in order of increasing $x$-coordinate, separated by semicolons.",
    "solution": "First, set the two equations equal to each other to get $2x^2-7x+1=8x^2+5x+1$. Combine like terms to get $6x^2+12x=0$. Then, we can divide by $6$ to get $x^2+2x=0$. To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{2}\\right)^2=1$ to both sides, giving $(x+1)^2=1$.\n\nSo we have $x+1=\\pm1$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x=-2$ or $0$. Using these in our original parabolas, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-2, 23)}$ and $\\boxed{(0, 1)}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the intersection points, we need to equate the two equations and solve for x.\n\nEquating the two equations, we get:\n\n$2x^2-7x+1 = 8x^2+5x+1$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$6x^2 + 12x = 0$\n\nDividing both sides by 6, we get:\n\n$x^2 + 2x = 0$\n\nFactoring out x, we get:\n\n$x(x + 2) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for x: x = 0 and x + 2 = 0, which gives x = -2.\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding y-values for these x-values.\n\nFor x = 0, we plug this value into either equation. We'll use the first equation:\n\ny = 2(0)^2 - 7(0) + 1\ny = 1\n\nFor x = -2, we plug this value into either equation. We'll use the first equation:\n\ny = 2(-2)^2 - 7(-2) + 1\ny = 2(4) + 14 + 1\ny = 8 + 14 + 1\ny = 23\n\nSo, the intersection points are (0, 1) and (-2, 23).\n\nIn order of increasing x-coordinate, the intersection points are (-2, 23); (0, 1).\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{(-2, 23); (0, 1)}$"
