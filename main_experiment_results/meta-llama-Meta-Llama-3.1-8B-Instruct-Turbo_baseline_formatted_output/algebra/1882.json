    "model_solution": "To find the value of $\\lfloor |-4.2| \\rfloor + |\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor|$, we need to evaluate each part of the expression.\n\nFirst, we find the absolute value of $-4.2$, which is $4.2$. Then, we take the floor of $4.2$, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to $4.2$, so $\\lfloor 4.2 \\rfloor = 4$.\n\nNext, we find the floor of $-4.2$, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to $-4.2$. Since the greatest integer less than $-4.2$ is $-5$, we have $\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor = -5$. The absolute value of $-5$ is $5$.\n\nNow, we add the two values together: $4 + 5 = 9$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$."
