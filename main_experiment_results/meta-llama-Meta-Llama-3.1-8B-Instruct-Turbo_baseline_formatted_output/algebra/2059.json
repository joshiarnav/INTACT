    "solution": "We can have $\\log_{10}10=1$ and $\\log_{10}100=2$.  Since $\\log_{10}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\\log_{10}10<\\log_{10}17<\\log_{10}100$, meaning $1<\\log_{10}17<2$.  Thus, the desired sum is $1+2=\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $\\log_{10}{17}$ between two consecutive integers, we can start by looking at the powers of 10.\n\n$\\log_{10}{10} = 1$\n$\\log_{10}{100} = 2$\n\nSince $\\log_{10}{10} = 1$ and $\\log_{10}{100} = 2$, we can say that $\\log_{10}{x}$ will be between 1 and 2 when $10 < x < 100$.\n\nNow, we are given $\\log_{10}{17}$. Since $10 < 17 < 100$, we know that $\\log_{10}{17}$ is between 1 and 2.\n\nSo, $a = 1$ and $b = 2$, and $a+b = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{3}$."
