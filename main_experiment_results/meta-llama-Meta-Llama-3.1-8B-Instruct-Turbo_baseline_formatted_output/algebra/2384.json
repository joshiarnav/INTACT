    "problem": "What is the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double?",
    "solution": "From the information given, we have $x^2 = 2x + 48$. Rearranging, we get $x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$, which we can factor as $(x+6)(x-8) = 0$. Therefore, $x = -6\\text{ or }8$.  Since we want the lesser, $\\boxed{-6}$ is our answer.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double, we need to set up an equation. \n\nLet the integer be x. The square of x is x^2, and the double of x is 2x. We are told that x^2 is 48 more than 2x, so we can write the equation as:\n\nx^2 = 2x + 48\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 48 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = -48. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a((-2)^2 - 4(1)(-48))) / 2(1)\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a(4 + 192)) / 2\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a196) / 2\nx = (2 \u00b1 14) / 2\n\nSimplifying the two possible values for x, we get:\n\nx = (2 + 14) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8\nx = (2 - 14) / 2 = -12 / 2 = -6\n\nSince we are looking for the least integer, the answer is x = -6.\n\nSo, the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double is $\\boxed{-6}$."
