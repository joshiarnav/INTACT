    "problem": "What is the value of $c$ if $x\\cdot(3x+1)<c$ if and only when $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$?",
    "solution": "When $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$, we have $x\\cdot(3x+1)-c<0$. This means that $x(3x+1)-c=0$ at $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x=2$. We now know that $x(3x+1)-c=0$ is a quadratic equation with roots at $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x=2$, and we want to use these roots to find a quadratic of the same form as the problem.  $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ gives us $(3x+7)=0$ and $x=2$ gives us $(x-2)=0$. \\begin{align*}\nx(3x+1)-c&=(3x+7)(x-2)\\\\\n&=3x^2+x-14\\\\\n&=x(3x+1)-14.\n\\end{align*} So, $c=\\boxed{14}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of c, we need to consider the endpoints of the interval given. \n\nFor x = -7/3, we have: \n\n-7/3 * (3*(-7/3) + 1) < c \n(-7/3) * (-7 + 1/3) < c \n(-7/3) * (-20/3) < c \n(140/9) < c\n\nFor x = 2, we have: \n\n2 * (3*2 + 1) < c \n2 * (7) < c \n14 < c\n\nSince the value of c must satisfy both inequalities, we take the maximum value between them. \n\nc > 140/9 and c > 14 \n\nThe smallest integer that satisfies both conditions is 16. But we need to find the exact value. So, 16 > c > 140/9. \n\n140/9 = 15.555... \n\nWe know that c > 140/9 and c < 16. So the exact value of c is the smallest number greater than 140/9. \n\nc = 16 - \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a small positive number. But since c must be greater than 140/9, the value of \u03b5 must be less than 16 - 140/9. \n\nSo the value of c is 16 - (16 - 140/9), which simplifies to 140/9."
