    "model_solution": "To evaluate $\\log_82$, we need to find the exponent to which 8 must be raised to get 2. \n\nThis can be written as the equation $8^x = 2$, where x is the value we're trying to find. \n\nSince $8 = 2^3$, we can rewrite this equation as $(2^3)^x = 2$. \n\nUsing the property of exponents, we can simplify this to $2^{3x} = 2$.\n\nThis means $3x = 1$ (since $a^b = c \\iff b = \\log_ac$), so $x = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\log_82 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
