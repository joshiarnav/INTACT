    "problem": "The Cookie Monster encounters a cookie whose boundary is the equation $x^2+y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3 y$ and is very confused. He wants to know if this cookie is a lunch-sized cookie or a snack-sized cookie. What is the radius of this cookie?",
    "solution": "The equation $x^2+y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3 y$ can be rewritten as $x^2-x+y^2-3y=6.5$. Completing the square and writing decimals as fractions, this can further be rewritten as $\\left( x - \\dfrac{1}{2} \\right)^2 - \\dfrac{1}{4} + \\left( y - \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)^2 - \\dfrac{9}{4}=\\dfrac{13}{2}$. Moving the constants to the right side of the equation, this is $\\left( x - \\dfrac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( y - \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)^2 = \\dfrac{10}{4}+\\dfrac{13}{2}=\\dfrac{18}{2}=9$, which is the equation of a circle with center $\\left( \\dfrac{1}{2}, \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)$ and radius $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the radius of the cookie, we need to rewrite the given equation in the standard form of a circle, which is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where (h, k) is the center of the circle and r is the radius.\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the given equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3y\nx^2 - x + y^2 - 3y = 6.5\n\nNow, let's complete the square for both x and y terms:\n\n(x^2 - x + 0.25) + (y^2 - 3y + 2.25) = 6.5 + 0.25 + 2.25\n(x - 0.5)^2 + (y - 1.5)^2 = 9\n\nComparing this with the standard form, we can see that the center of the circle is (0.5, 1.5) and the radius squared is 9. \n\nTo find the radius, we take the square root of 9:\n\nr = sqrt(9) = 3\n\nSo, the radius of the cookie is 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
