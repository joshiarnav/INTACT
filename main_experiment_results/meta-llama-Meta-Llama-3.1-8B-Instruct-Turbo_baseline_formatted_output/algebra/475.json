    "problem": "What is the greatest integer $x$ such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime?",
    "solution": "We can factor the quadratic $6x^2-47x+15$ as $(2x-15)(3x-1)$. So we have $|6x^2-47x+15|=|(2x-15)(3x-1)|=|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|$. In order for $|6x^2-47x+15|$ to be prime, its only divisors must be $1$ and itself. Thus one of $|2x-15|$ or $|3x-1|$ must be equal to $1$.\n\nIf $|3x-1|=1$, then $3x-1=1$ or $3x-1=-1$. These equations yield $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $x=0$, respectively. We throw out $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ since it is not an integer, and keep $x=0$ as a candidate.\n\nIf $|2x-15|=1$, then $2x-15=1$, in which case $2x=16$ and $x=8$, or $2x-15=-1$, in which case $2x=14$ and $x=7$.\n\nThus our candidates for the greatest $x$ are $0, 7$, and $8$. It remains to check whether the other factor is prime. We first check $x=8$. Since $|2x-15|=1$, we know $|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|=|3x-1|=|24-1|=23$, which is prime. Thus $\\boxed{8}$ is the largest integer for which $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime.",

    "model_solution": "To find the greatest integer x such that |6x^2 - 47x + 15| is prime, we need to factorize the quadratic expression.\n\nFirst, we can rewrite the quadratic expression as |6x^2 - 47x + 15| = |(2x - 15)(3x - 1)|.\n\nWe are looking for values of x such that |(2x - 15)(3x - 1)| is prime. This can only happen if either (2x - 15) or (3x - 1) is equal to 1 or -1, as the absolute value of a product is prime if and only if one of the factors is 1 or -1.\n\nSo, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 15 = 1\nCase 2: 2x - 15 = -1\nCase 3: 3x - 1 = 1\nCase 4: 3x - 1 = -1\n\nSolving each of the above cases, we get the following values of x:\n\nCase 1: 2x - 15 = 1 => 2x = 16 => x = 8\n\nCase 2: 2x - 15 = -1 => 2x = 14 => x = 7\n\nCase 3: 3x - 1 = 1 => 3x = 2 => x = (2/3)\n\nCase 4: 3x - 1 = -1 => 3x = 0 => x = (0/3) = 0 (This case is not valid as we are looking for the greatest integer value of x)\n\nNow we have values of x, we need to check if the absolute value of the product |(2x - 15)(3x - 1)| is prime for each of these values.\n\nCase 1: x = 8, |(2x - 15)(3x - 1)| = |(2*8 - 15)(3*8 - 1)| = |(1)(23)| = 23, which is prime.\n\nCase 2: x = 7, |(2x - 15)(3x - 1)| = |(2*7 - 15)(3*7 - 1)| = |(-3)(20)| = 60, which is not prime.\n\nTherefore, the greatest integer x such that |6x^2 - 47x + 15| is prime is 8.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\boxed{8}"
