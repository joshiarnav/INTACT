    "problem": "Given positive integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x\\neq y$ and $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{18}$, what is the smallest possible value for $x + y$?",
    "solution": "Simplifying, we have  $18(x+y)=xy$, so $xy - 18x - 18y = 0$ Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick by adding 324 to both sides, we get $xy-18x-18y +324=324$, so \\[(x-18)(y-18)=324.\\]Now we seek the minimal $x+y,$ which occurs when $x-18$ and $y-18$ are as close to each other in value as possible. The two best candidates are $(x-18,y-18)=(12,27)$ or $(9,36),$ of which $(x,y)=(30,45)$ attains the minimum sum of $\\boxed{75}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest possible value for $x + y$, we start by multiplying both sides of the equation $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{18}$ by $18xy$ to eliminate the fractions. This gives us:\n\n$$18y + 18x = xy$$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n$$xy - 18x - 18y = 0$$\n\nNow, let's use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick to rewrite the equation. Adding $324$ to both sides, we get:\n\n$$xy - 18x - 18y + 324 = 324$$\n\nFactoring the left-hand side, we get:\n\n$$(x - 18)(y - 18) = 324$$\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, the factors of $324$ must be positive integers. Let's list the factors of $324$:\n\n$$1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 27, 36, 54, 81, 108, 162, 324$$\n\nWe can now consider each factor pair of $324$ and solve for $x$ and $y$. Since we want to minimize $x + y$, we should start with the smallest factor pair.\n\nThe smallest factor pair of $324$ is $(1, 324)$. This gives us:\n\n$$x - 18 = 1 \\Rightarrow x = 19$$\n$$y - 18 = 324 \\Rightarrow y = 342$$\n\nHowever, this doesn't satisfy the condition $x+y$. So we move on to the next pair of factors.\n\nThe next factor pair of $324$ is $(2, 162)$. This gives us:\n\n$$x - 18 = 2 \\Rightarrow x = 20$$\n$$y - 18 = 162 \\Rightarrow y = 180$$\n\nThe next factor pair of $324$ is $(3, 108)$. This gives us:\n\n$$x - 18 = 3 \\Rightarrow x = 21$$\n$$y - 18 = 108 \\Rightarrow y = 126$$\n\nThe next factor pair of $324$ is $(4, 81)$. This gives us:\n\n$$x - 18 = 4 \\Rightarrow x = 22$$\n$$y - 18 = 81 \\Rightarrow y = 99$$\n\nThe next factor pair of $324$ is $(6, 54)$. This gives us:\n\n$$x - 18 = 6 \\Rightarrow x = 24$$\n$$y - 18 = 54 \\Rightarrow y = 72$$\n\nThe next factor pair of $324$ is $(9, 36)$. This gives us:\n\n$$x - 18 = 9 \\Rightarrow x = 27$$\n$$y - 18 = 36 \\Rightarrow y = 54$$\n\nThe final factor pair of $324$ is $(18, 18)$. This is not a valid solution because it doesn't satisfy the condition $x \\neq y$.\n\nWe have found several possible values for $x$ and $y$, but we want to find the smallest possible value for $x + y$. Let's calculate the sum of $x$ and $y$ for each solution:\n\n$$x + y = 19 + 342 = 361$$\n$$x + y = 20 + 180 = 200$$\n$$x + y = 21 + 126 = 147$$\n$$x + y = 22 + 99 = 121$$\n$$x + y = 24 + 72 = 96$$\n$$x + y = 27 + 54 = 81$$\n\nThe smallest possible value for $x + y$ is $\\boxed{81}$."
