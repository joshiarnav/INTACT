    "solution": "Looking at the graph, we can see the line intersects the y-axis at y=1.  This is the y-intercept, which is equal to the value of $b$.  Now, we need to find the slope of the line.  Looking carefully, we can see that for every one unit to the right the line travels, it goes up by two units.  For example, starting from the y-intercept at $(0,1)$, the line passes through a lattice point one unit over and two units up from there, at $(1,3)$.  The rise over run is then $\\frac{2}{1}$, so the slope is 2.  The equation of this line is $y=2x+1$.  Therefore, $mb=2(1)=\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the slope $m$ and the y-intercept $b$ of the line. \n\nThe y-intercept is the point at which the line crosses the y-axis. From the diagram, we can see that the line crosses the y-axis at $y = 1$. Therefore, $b = 1$.\n\nThe slope of the line is the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run). Looking at the diagram, we can see that the line starts at $(2, -5)$ and passes through $(0, 1)$. The vertical change is $1 - (-5) = 6$ and the horizontal change is $0 - 2 = -2$. The slope is therefore $m = \\frac{6}{-2} = -3$.\n\nWe can now calculate $mb$ by multiplying the values of $m$ and $b$ together: $mb = (-3)(1) = -3$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{-3}$."
