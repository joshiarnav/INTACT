    "problem": "What is the sum of all values of $k$ such that the equation $2x^2-kx+8=0$ has two distinct integer solutions?",
    "solution": "We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively. Let the two roots of the equation be $p$ and $q$. Then $p+q=k/2$. However the only other restriction on $p$ and $q$ is that $pq = 4$ and that $p$ and $q$ are distinct integers. For each such possibility $(p,q)$, we also have the possibility $(-p,-q)$ since $(-p)(-q) = pq = 4$. This gives two values of $k$: $k=2(p+q)$ and $k=2(-p-q)$. Since these occur in such pairs, the sum of all possible values of $k$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nAlternatively, one can note that the only way to factor 4 into 2 distinct integer factors is $4\\cdot1$ and $(-4)(-1)$, so that the two possible values of $k$ are $10$ and $-10$, given a sum of $0$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will use Vieta's formulas. For a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, Vieta's formulas state that if the roots are $r$ and $s$, then $r + s = -\\frac{b}{a}$ and $rs + r + s = \\frac{c}{a}$.\n\nGiven the equation $2x^2 - kx + 8 = 0$, the sum of the roots is $\\frac{k}{2}$, and the product of the roots is $\\frac{8}{2} = 4$.\n\nSince the roots are integers, we can list all pairs of distinct integers whose product is 4:\n- $(-4, -1)$\n- $(-4, 1)$\n- $(-2, -2)$\n- $(-2, 2)$\n- $(1, -4)$\n- $(1, 4)$\n- $(2, -2)$\n- $(2, 2)$\n\nWe disregard the pairs of $(2, -2)$ and $(2, 2)$ as they do not have two distinct roots. For each of the other pairs, we calculate the possible value of $k$ using the formula $\\frac{k}{2}$. For $(-4, -1)$ and $(1, -4)$, we get the same value of $\\frac{k}{2} = 3$. For $(-4, 1)$ and $(1, 4)$, we get the same value of $\\frac{k}{2} = -3$. For $(-2, -2)$, we get $\\frac{k}{2} = 0$.\n\nThus, the possible values for $k$ are 6 and -6, and their sum is $6 + (-6) = \\boxed{0}$."
