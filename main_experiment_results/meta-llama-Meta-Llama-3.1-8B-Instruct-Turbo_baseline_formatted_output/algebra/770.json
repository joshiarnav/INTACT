    "problem": "Alex has 12 friends and 63 coins. What is the minimum number of additional coins he needs so that he can give each friend at least one coin and no two friends receive the same number of coins?",
    "solution": "Alex wants to minimize the number of coins he gives to his friends without giving any two of them the same number of coins. The minimum number of coins he can give to a friend is 1. He then gives 2 coins to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 12. The total number of coins Alex has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+12 = \\frac{12 \\cdot 13}{2}=78$.  Thus, Alex needs $78-63=\\boxed{15}$ more coins.",

    "model_solution": "To ensure that each friend gets a unique number of coins, the distribution can be as follows:\n\n- 1 friend gets 1 coin\n- 1 friend gets 2 coins\n- 1 friend gets 3 coins\n- ...\n- 1 friend gets 12 coins\n\nThe total number of coins given in this distribution is the sum of the first 12 natural numbers. The formula for this sum is:\n\nSum = n(n + 1)/2\n\nwhere n is the number of terms. In this case, n = 12.\n\nSum = 12(12 + 1)/2\n= 12(13)/2\n= 13 * 6\n= 78\n\nSince Alex already has 63 coins, he needs to get 78 - 63 = 15 more coins.\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
