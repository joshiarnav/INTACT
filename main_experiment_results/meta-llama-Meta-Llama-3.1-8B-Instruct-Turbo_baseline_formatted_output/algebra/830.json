    "solution": "The number of squares in the rectangles is an arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference 1. Thus, at Stage 6, there will be 6 squares. Since each square has an area of $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ square inches, the total area of the rectangle at Stage 6 is $6 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{54}$ square inches.",

    "model_solution": "At Stage 1, there is 1 square, so the area is 3 * 3 = 9 square inches.\nAt Stage 2, there are 2 squares, so the area is 2 * 3 * 3 = 18 square inches.\nAt Stage 3, there are 3 squares, so the area is 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 square inches.\n\nNotice that at each stage, the area is 3 times the previous area. This is a geometric sequence with a first term of 9 and a common ratio of 3.\n\nTo find the area at Stage 6, we can use the formula for a geometric sequence: $a_n = a_1 * r^{n-1}$. In this case, $a_1$ = 9, $r$ = 3, and $n$ = 6.\n\nPlugging in these values, we get: $a_6 = 9 * 3^{6-1} = 9 * 3^5 = 9 * 243 = 2187$.\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle at Stage 6 is $\\boxed{2187}$ square inches."
