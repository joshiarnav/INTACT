    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the first six terms in the geometric sequence, we first need to identify the first term (a) and the common ratio (r). \n\nIn this sequence, the first term (a) is $\\frac12$ and the common ratio (r) is $\\frac14$ divided by $\\frac12$, which equals $\\frac12$.\n\nThe formula to find the sum of the first n terms in a geometric sequence is: \n\nS = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nNow we can substitute the values into the formula:\n\na = $\\frac12$\nr = $\\frac12$\nn = 6\n\nS = $\\frac12$ * (1 - ($\\frac12)^6$) / (1 - $\\frac12$)\nS = $\\frac12$ * (1 - $\\frac{1}{64}$) / ($\\frac12$)\nS = $\\frac{63}{64}$\n\nSo the sum of the first six terms in the geometric sequence is $\\boxed{\\frac{63}{64}}$."
