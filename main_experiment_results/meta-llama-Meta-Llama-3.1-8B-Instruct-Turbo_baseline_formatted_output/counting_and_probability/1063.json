    "problem": "How many distinct sequences of four letters can be made from the letters in EQUALS if each sequence must begin with L, end with Q, and no letter can appear in a sequence more than once?",
    "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",
    "total_tokens": 262,
    "time_taken": 3.4662158489227295,
    "file_name": "./MATH_subsample_uniform/counting_and_probability/1063.json",
    "model_solution": "To find the number of distinct sequences, we need to consider the restrictions given. The first letter must be 'L', and the last letter must be 'Q'. Since no letter can appear more than once, we have 4 letters remaining ('E', 'U', 'A', 'S') to choose from for the second and third positions.\n\nFor the second position, we have 4 choices (since we can choose any of the remaining 4 letters). Once a letter is chosen for the second position, we have 3 remaining choices for the third position (since we can't choose the letter that was used in the second position).\n\nSo, the total number of distinct sequences is 4 (choices for the second position) times 3 (choices for the third position), which is 12.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
