    "problem": "In how many ways can 8 people be seated in a row of chairs if three of the people, John, Wilma, and Paul, refuse to sit in three consecutive seats?",
    "solution": "The number of all seating arrangements is $8!$. The number of seating arrangements in which John, Wilma and Paul sit next to each other is $6!\\times 3!$. We can arrive at $6!\\times 3!$ by considering John, Wilma and Paul as one person, arranging the ``six'' people (the JWP super-person plus the 5 other people) first, then arranging John, Wilma and Paul.  Thus the number of acceptable arrangements is $$8!-6!\\times 3!=8\\times 7\\times 6! - 6!\\times 3! = (8\\times 7 - 3!)6! = (50)(720)=\\boxed{36000}.$$",

    "file_name": "./MATH_subsample_uniform/counting_and_probability/1105.json",
    "model_solution": "To find the total number of ways to seat 8 people in a row without any restrictions, we use the formula for permutations, which is n!. In this case, n = 8, so the total number of ways is 8! = 40,320.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways that John, Wilma, and Paul sit in three consecutive seats. We can consider them as a single unit. This unit, along with the remaining 5 people, can be arranged in 6! ways. However, within the unit, John, Wilma, and Paul can be arranged in 3! ways. So, the total number of ways for them to sit in three consecutive seats is 6! * 3! = 4320.\n\nThe number of ways that John, Wilma, and Paul do not sit in three consecutive seats is the difference between the total number of ways and the number of ways they sit in three consecutive seats. So, the answer is 40,320 - 4320 = 36,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{36,000}$."
