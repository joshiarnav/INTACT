    "problem": "How many three-digit numbers are multiples of neither 5 nor 7?",
    "solution": "It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 5 or 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \\times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 that is a three-digit number is $142 \\times 7 = 994$.  Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7.  The smallest multiple of 5 that is a three-digit number is $20\\times 5 = 100$, and the largest multiple of 5 that is a three digit number is $199\\times 5 =995$. So there are $199-20+1=180$ multiples of 5.\n\nNow notice that we have counted some numbers twice: those multiples of $5\\times7=35$. The smallest multiple of 35 is $3\\times 35 = 105$, the largest multiple of 35 is $28\\times35 =980$. So there are $28-3+1=26$ multiples of 35.\n\nWe have 128 multiples of 7 and 180 multiples of 5, but we count 26 multiples twice.  So, there are a total of $128+180-26 = 282$ distinct three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 (or both).   There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-282=\\boxed{618}$ three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7 nor 5.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, we need to first find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7.\n\nThe first three-digit number is 100 and the last is 999. \n\nMultiples of 5: The first multiple of 5 in the three-digit range is 100, and the last is 995. \nNumber of multiples of 5 = (995 - 100) / 5 + 1 = 180.\n\nMultiples of 7: The first multiple of 7 in the three-digit range is 105, and the last is 994.\nNumber of multiples of 7 = (994 - 105) / 7 + 1 = 128.\n\nHowever, some numbers are multiples of both 5 and 7. These numbers are multiples of their least common multiple, which is 35.\nMultiples of 35: The first multiple of 35 in the three-digit range is 105, and the last is 980.\nNumber of multiples of 35 = (980 - 105) / 35 + 1 = 26.\n\nNow, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7:\nNumber of multiples of 5 or 7 = Number of multiples of 5 + Number of multiples of 7 - Number of multiples of 35\n= 180 + 128 - 26\n= 282\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of three-digit numbers:\nTotal number of three-digit numbers = (999 - 100) + 1 = 900.\n\nThe number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7 is the total number of three-digit numbers minus the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7:\n= Total number of three-digit numbers - Number of multiples of 5 or 7\n= 900 - 282\n= 618\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{618}$."
