    "problem": "A pirate is searching for buried treasure on 6 islands. On each island, there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that the island has buried treasure and no traps, a $\\frac{1}{12}$ chance that the island has traps but no treasure, and a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance that the island has neither traps nor treasure. What is the probability that while searching all 6 islands, the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure, and none with traps?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose 3 islands. For each of these choices, there is a probability of $\\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3$ that the chosen islands have treasure and the remaining ones have neither treasure nor traps. Therefore, the probability that the pirate encounters exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps is $20 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of binomial probability. \n\nThe probability that an island has treasure and no traps is $\\frac{1}{4}$, and the probability that an island has neither traps nor treasure is $\\frac{2}{3}$. \n\nWe want to find the probability that exactly 3 islands have treasure and no traps, and the remaining 3 islands have neither traps nor treasure. \n\nThis can be calculated as the product of the probability of each of these events occurring, as they are independent events. \n\nThe probability of 3 islands having treasure is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3$, and 3 islands having neither traps nor treasure is $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3$. \n\nAdditionally, we need to consider the number of ways in which we can choose 3 islands out of 6 to have treasure. This is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{6}{3} = 20$. \n\nTherefore, the total probability is given by:\n\n$\\binom{6}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = 20\\left(\\frac{1}{64}\\right)\\left(\\frac{8}{27}\\right) = \\frac{5}{54}$.\n\nSo the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$."
