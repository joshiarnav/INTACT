    "problem": "An unfair coin lands on heads with probability $\\frac34$ and tails with probability $\\frac14$.  A heads flip gains $\\$3$, but a tails flip loses $\\$8$.  What is the expected worth of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "By definition, we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities, and add them up: $E = \\frac34(+\\$3) + \\frac14(-\\$8) = \\boxed{\\$0.25}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the expected worth of a coin flip, we multiply the probability of each outcome by its worth, then add the results. \n\nFor a heads flip, the probability is $\\frac34$ and the worth is $\\$3$, so the expected value from a heads flip is:\n$\\frac34 \\cdot 3 = 2.25$\n\nFor a tails flip, the probability is $\\frac14$ and the worth is $-\\$8$, so the expected value from a tails flip is:\n$\\frac14 \\cdot -8 = -2$\n\nThe total expected worth of a coin flip is the sum of the expected worth from a heads flip and a tails flip:\n$2.25 - 2 = 0.25$\n\nSo, the expected worth of a coin flip is $\\boxed{0.25}$."
