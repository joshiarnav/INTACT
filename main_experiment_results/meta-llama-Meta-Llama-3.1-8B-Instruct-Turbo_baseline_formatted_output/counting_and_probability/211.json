    "problem": "Suppose 5 different integers are randomly chosen from between 20 and 69, inclusive.  What is the probability that they each have a different tens digit?",
    "solution": "In this set of integers, there are 5 tens digits: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.  If 5 integers all have different tens digits, then there must be exactly one integer among the 5 with each tens digit.  Since there are 10 different integers for each tens digit, the number of ways to pick, without regard to order, 5 different integers with different tens digits is $10^5$.  The total number of combinations of 5 integers is $\\binom{50}{5}$.  So the probability that 5 integers drawn all have the different tens digits is $$ \\frac{10^5}{\\binom{50}{5}} = \\frac{100000}{2118760} = \\boxed{\\frac{2500}{52969}}. $$",

    "model_solution": "There are 50 integers between 20 and 69, inclusive. The tens digits of these numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. \n\nTo have 5 different integers with different tens digits, we can choose one integer from each of the tens digit groups. \n\nThere are 10 integers in each tens digit group, so the number of ways to choose 5 distinct integers with different tens digits is $10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 100,000$.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 5 integers from the 50 integers between 20 and 69, inclusive, is $\\binom{50}{5}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of having 5 integers with different tens digits is\n\n$\\frac{100,000}{\\binom{50}{5}} = \\frac{100,000}{2,118,760} \\approx 0.0472$\n\nHowever, the answer should be simplified into a more manageable format like a fraction or a lower decimal. \n\nWe can simplify this probability by using the values of $\\binom{50}{5}$, which is equal to 2,118,760, and our numerator, which is 100,000.\n\n$100,000 / 2,118,760 \\approx 0.0472$\n\nNow simplifying this fraction: \n\n$\\frac{100,000}{2,118,760}$\n\nDividing both the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common divisor of 100,000 and 2,118,760, which is 10, we get:\n\n$\\frac{10,000}{211,876}$\n\nDivide both the numerator and the denominator by 2 to get\n\n$\\frac{5,000}{105,938}$\n\nNow, divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2 again to get\n\n$\\frac{2,500}{52,969}$\n\nNow, the greatest common divisor of 2,500 and 52,969 is 1, so the simplified fraction is $\\frac{2,500}{52,969}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that they each have a different tens digit is $\\boxed{\\frac{2500}{52969}}$."
