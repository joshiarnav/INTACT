    "solution": "We note that the points for which $x+y<3$ are those that lie below the line $x+y = 3$, or $y= -x + 3$.  As the diagram below illustrates, these are all the points in the square except those in the triangle with vertices (2,1), (2,2), and (1,2).\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(.7);\n\ndraw((-.1,0)--(3,0),Arrow);\ndraw((0,-.1)--(0,4),Arrow);\n\ndraw((0,2)--(2,2)--(2,0));\ndraw((-.5,3.5)--(2.5,.5),dashed,Arrows);\n\nfill((0,0)--(0,2)--(1,2)--(2,1)--(2,0)--cycle,gray(.7));\n\nlabel(\"(1,2)\",(1,2),NE);\nlabel(\"(2,2)\",(2,2),NE);\nlabel(\"(2,1)\",(2,1),NE);\n[/asy]\n\nSince this is a right triangle whose sides both of length 1, its area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1^2 = 1/2$.  Since the square in question has side length 2, its area is $2^2 = 4$, so the shaded region has area $4 - 1/2 = 7/2$.  Our probability is therefore $\\dfrac{7/2}{4} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{8}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that $x+y < 3$, we need to find the area of the region that satisfies this inequality and divide it by the area of the square.\n\nThe inequality $x+y < 3$ can be rewritten as $y < -x + 3$. This represents a line with a slope of -1 and a y-intercept of 3. We want to find the area of the region below this line that is inside the square.\n\nThe square has a side length of 2, so its area is 2^2 = 4. \n\nThe line $y = -x + 3$ intersects the square at the point (1,2), which is the top right corner of the square. However, we need to find the area of the region below this line and inside the square. This region is a triangle with vertices (1,2), (2,1), and (1,1).\n\nThe area of the triangle is 1/2 * base * height = 1/2 * 1 * 1 = 1/2.\n\nHowever, the line also intersects the square at the point (1,2), and we need to consider the area below the line and inside the square, but not including the triangle formed by the points (1,1), (1,2), and (2,1). This area is also a triangle, with vertices (1,1), (2,1), and (1,2).\n\nThe area of this triangle is 1/2 * base * height = 1/2 * 1 * 1 = 1/2.\n\nHowever, the line is just slightly above the point (1,2).  Thus, the total area under the line and inside the square is the area of the square minus the area of the square that is above the line. This area is a triangle with vertices (2,1), (2,2), and (1,2).\n\nThe area of this triangle is 1/2 * base * height = 1/2 * 1 * 1 = 1/2.\n\nHowever, we're trying to solve for the area that satisfies the inequality x + y < 3.  This area is then the total area of the square, minus the area of the square that is above the line.\n\nThe area of the square is 4. The area of the triangle above the line is 1/2.\n\nThus, the area that satisfies the inequality is the area of the square minus the area above the line. This is 4 - 1/2 = 7/2.\n\nThe probability is then the area that satisfies the inequality divided by the area of the square.\n\nThis is 7/2 / 4 = 7/8.\n\nSo, the probability that $x+y < 3$ is $\\boxed{7/8}$."
