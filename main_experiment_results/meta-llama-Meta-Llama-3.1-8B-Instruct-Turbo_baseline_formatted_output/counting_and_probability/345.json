    "problem": "If two distinct numbers are selected at random from the first seven prime numbers, what is the probability that their sum is an even number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2. There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum IS even is $1-\\frac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",

    "model_solution": "The first seven prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\nTo find the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers selected from these seven prime numbers is an even number, we can analyze the possible cases and outcomes. \n\n1. If one of the numbers selected is 2, the other number must be an even number to have an even sum. However, since 2 is the only even prime number in this list, the probability of selecting 2 and another even prime number is 0.\n2. If none of the numbers selected is 2, then the sum of the two numbers will be even if and only if both numbers are even (which is impossible since 2 is the only even prime number) or both numbers are odd. The probability of selecting two odd prime numbers is therefore the number of ways of selecting 2 odd prime numbers out of 6 odd prime numbers divided by the number of ways of selecting 2 distinct numbers out of 7 prime numbers.\n\nThe number of ways of selecting 2 distinct numbers out of 7 prime numbers is given by the combination formula: $\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7!}{2! \\cdot 5!} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 6}{2} = 21$.\n\nThe number of ways of selecting 2 distinct odd prime numbers out of 6 odd prime numbers is given by the combination formula: $\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2! \\cdot 4!} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5}{2} = 15$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers selected from the first seven prime numbers is an even number is:\n\n$\\frac{\\binom{6}{2}}{\\binom{7}{2}} = \\frac{15}{21} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$."
