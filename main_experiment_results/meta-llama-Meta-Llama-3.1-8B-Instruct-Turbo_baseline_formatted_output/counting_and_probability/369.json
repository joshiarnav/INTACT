    "solution": "There are 8 Republicans and 3 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ ways to choose the Republicans.  There are 6 Democrats and 2 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose the Democrats.  So there are $56 \\times 15 = \\boxed{840}$ ways to choose the subcommittee.",

    "model_solution": "To form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8 and 2 Democrats from 6.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8 is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3! \u00d7 (8-3)!)\n= 8! / (3! \u00d7 5!)\n= (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)\n= 56\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 Democrats from 6 is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! \u00d7 (6-2)!)\n= 6! / (2! \u00d7 4!)\n= (6 \u00d7 5) / (2 \u00d7 1)\n= 15\n\nSince the choices of Republicans and Democrats are independent, we multiply the number of ways to choose each group:\n\n56 \u00d7 15 = 840\n\nSo, there are 840 ways to form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats.\n\n$\\boxed{840}$"
