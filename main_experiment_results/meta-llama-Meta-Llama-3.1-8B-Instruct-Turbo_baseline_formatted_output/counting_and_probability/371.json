    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable but the boxes are?",
    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of balls in the different boxes.\n\nThere are $3$ ways to arrange the balls as $(5,0,0)$ (specifically, box 1 can have 5, box 2 can have 5, box 3 can have 5).\n\nThere are $3! = 6$ to arrange $(4,1,0)$ and $3! = 6$ ways to arrange $(3,2,0)$; in each case, we must choose one of the 3 boxes to have the largest number of balls, and also one of the remaining two boxes to be left empty.\n\nHowever, there are only $3$ ways to arrange $(3,1,1)$, and $3$ ways to arrange $(2,2,1)$; in each case, we must choose one box to have the `different' number of balls (3 in the $(3,1,1)$ case and 1 in the $(2,2,1)$ case).\n\nThis gives a total of $3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = \\boxed{21}$ arrangements.",

    "model_solution": "To put 5 indistinguishable balls in 3 distinguishable boxes, we can use the stars and bars method. This method is used for counting the number of ways to put indistinguishable objects into distinguishable bins.\n\nThe idea behind this method is to imagine we have 5 stars (representing the balls) and 2 bars (representing the separation between the boxes). We want to arrange these 7 objects (5 stars + 2 bars) in any order.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange 7 objects is given by the formula 7 choose 2, which is calculated as:\n\n7 choose 2 = 7! / (2! * (7 - 2)!)\n= 7! / (2! * 5!)\n= (7 * 6 * 5!) / (2! * 5!)\n= (7 * 6) / (2 * 1)\n= 21\n\nSo, there are 21 ways to put 5 indistinguishable balls in 3 distinguishable boxes.\n\n$\\boxed{21}$"
