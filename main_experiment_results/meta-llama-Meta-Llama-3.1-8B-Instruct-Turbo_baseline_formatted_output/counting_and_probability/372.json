    "solution": "The number of pairs of neighbors for Cara actually has nothing to do with the shape of the table she is sitting at. That is, all that matters is that she has 5 friends and two of them will be her neighbors. There are ${5 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{10}$ pairs of friends that she can thus sit between.",

    "model_solution": "Since Cara is sitting at the center of the circular table, there are 5 friends sitting around her. To find the possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between, we need to find the number of combinations of 2 friends out of the 5.\n\nThe number of combinations of 2 friends out of 5 can be calculated using the formula:\n\nnC2 = n! / (2!(n-2)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of friends (5) and nC2 is the number of combinations of 2 friends out of n.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the factorial of 5: \n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n\nThen, calculate the factorial of 2:\n2! = 2 * 1 = 2\n\nNext, calculate the factorial of 5-2 (which is 3):\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n\nNow, plug these values into the formula:\nnC2 = 120 / (2 * 6)\n= 120 / 12\n= 10\n\nHowever, the problem is looking for the number of pairs. For instance, the pair \"A\" and \"B\" is the same as the pair \"B\" and \"A\". Hence the answer is 10/2. \n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$."
