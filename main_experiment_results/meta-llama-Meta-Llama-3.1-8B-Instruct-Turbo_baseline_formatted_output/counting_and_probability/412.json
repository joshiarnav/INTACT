    "problem": "How many distinct triangles can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube? (Two triangles are distinct if they have different locations in space.)",
    "solution": "There are eight vertices of a cube, and we choose three of these to form a triangle. Thus, the number of distinct triangles that can be formed is $\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8\\cdot7\\cdot6}{3\\cdot2} = \\boxed{56}$.",

    "model_solution": "A cube has 8 vertices. To form a triangle, we need to choose 3 different vertices from these 8 vertices. This can be calculated using the combination formula, denoted as C(n, r) or \"n choose r\", which is given by:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n\nIn this case, we have n = 8 (total number of vertices) and r = 3 (number of vertices we need to choose for a triangle). \n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!)\n= 8! / (3! * 5!)\n= (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n= (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n= 56\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct triangles that can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube is:\n\n$\\boxed{56}$"
