    "problem": "The numbers from 1 to 150, inclusive, are placed in a bag and a number is randomly selected from the bag. What is the probability it is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "It is easier to count the number of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. We see there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150, namely $1^{2}, 2^{2}, \\ldots, 12^{2}$, and there are 5 perfect cubes, namely $1^{3}, \\ldots, 5^{3}$. Then notice there are two repetitions, $1^{6} =1^2 = 1^3 = 1$ and $2^{6} = 8^2 = 4^3 = 64$. So there is a total of $12+5-2=15$ integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Thus, we get $150-15=135$ integers from 1 to 150 that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes. So the probability that we select such a number is $\\frac{135}{150} = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the selected number is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube, we need to find the total number of such numbers and divide it by the total number of numbers in the bag (which is 150).\n\nThe perfect squares from 1 to 150 are: $1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, 7^2, 8^2, 9^2, 10^2, 11^2, 12^2$. \nThere are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150.\n\nThe perfect cubes from 1 to 150 are: $1^3, 2^3, 3^3, 4^3, 5^3, 6^3$. \nHowever, there are 6 perfect cubes from 1 to 150.\n\nNotice that there is an overlap between the set of perfect squares and the set of perfect cubes, which are $1^6 = 1$ and $2^6 = 64$. \n\nThe numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes from 1 to 150 are: $1^6 = 1$ and $2^6 = 64$. \nThere are 2 such numbers.\n\nTo find the number of numbers that are either a perfect square or a perfect cube, we add the number of perfect squares and the number of perfect cubes, and then subtract the number of numbers that are both a perfect square and a perfect cube. \n\nThe number of numbers that are either a perfect square or a perfect cube = 12 + 6 - 2 = 16\n\nNow, we subtract the number of numbers that are either a perfect square or a perfect cube from the total number of numbers in the bag to find the number of numbers that are neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube.\n\nThe number of numbers that are neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube = 150 - 16 = 134\n\nThe probability that the selected number is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube = $\\frac{134}{150}$.\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get $\\frac{134}{150} = \\frac{67}{75}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the selected number is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube is $\\boxed{\\frac{67}{75}}$."
