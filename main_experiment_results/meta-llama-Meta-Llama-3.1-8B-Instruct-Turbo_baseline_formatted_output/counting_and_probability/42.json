    "problem": "How many different positive, four-digit integers can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9 and 9?",
    "solution": "We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting. That is, if we had 4 distinct digits, there would be $4! = 24$ orderings. However, we must divide by 2! once for the repetition of the digit 2, and divide by 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digit were different we would have twice as many orderings). So, our answer is $\\frac{4!}{2!\\cdot 2!} = 2 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{6}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of different positive, four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9, we need to use the concept of permutations with repeated elements.\n\nWhen all the digits are unique, the number of permutations is 4!. However, since the digits 2 and 9 are repeated, we need to divide by the factorials of their multiplicities, which are 2! for each of them.\n\nSo, the number of different positive, four-digit integers that can be formed is:\n\n$\\frac{4!}{2! \\cdot 2!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6$\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{6}$"
