    "problem": "In how many different ways can four students stand in a straight line if two of the students refuse to stand next to each other?",
    "solution": "We will count the number of ways in which the two students do stand next to each other and then subtract that from the total number of ways all four students can stand in a line without the restriction. If the two students stand next to each other, then we can treat them as a block. There are three blocks: two one-student blocks and one two-student block. We can arrange the blocks in $3!=6$ ways, and there are 2 ways to arrange the students within the two-student block, for a total of $6\\cdot2=12$ ways. The total number of ways to arrange all four students in a line without restrictions is $4!=24$ ways. Thus, the number of ways with the restriction is $24-12=\\boxed{12}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of ways four students can stand in a line without any restrictions. This is a permutation problem with 4 items, and the number of permutations is given by 4! (4 factorial), which is equal to 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of ways in which the two students who refuse to stand next to each other are together. If we consider these two students as a single unit, then there are 3 items (the single unit and the other two students) that can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.\n\nHowever, within the single unit, the two students can also be arranged in 2! = 2 ways (either student can be on the left). So, the total number of ways in which the two students are together is 6 \u00d7 2 = 12.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways in which the four students can stand in a line with the two students who refuse to stand next to each other is 24 - 12 = 12.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$."
