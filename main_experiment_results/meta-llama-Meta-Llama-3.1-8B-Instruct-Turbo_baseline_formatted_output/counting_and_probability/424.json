    "problem": "How many three digit numbers are left if we exclude all three digit numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent?",
    "solution": "The only three digit numbers which are ruled out are numbers of the form $ABA$, where A and B are different digits. There are 9 ways to choose A, since it can't be 0, and once A has been chosen there are 9 ways to choose B. Since there are $9\\cdot10\\cdot10=900$ total three digit numbers, and $9\\cdot9=81$ numbers which aren't valid, there are $900-81=\\boxed{819}$ valid numbers.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of three-digit numbers and then subtract the number of three-digit numbers where exactly two digits are the same but not adjacent. \n\nThere are 900 three-digit numbers (from 100 to 999). \n\nFor the numbers where exactly two digits are the same but not adjacent, consider the hundreds place. The hundreds place can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it can't be 0). The tens and units place can be the same digit, but since they can't be adjacent, the tens place must be the same as the hundreds place, and the units place must be a different digit. However, the units place cannot be 0 (because then it would not be a three-digit number), so there are 9 possibilities for the hundreds place (1-9), 9 possibilities for the units place (1-9 excluding the hundreds place digit), and 1 possibility for the tens place (must be the same as the hundreds place).\n\nSo the total number of these numbers is $9 * 9 * 1 = 81$.\n\nHowever, this is not all the numbers we need to exclude. We also need to exclude the numbers where we have 1, 2, or 3. So we have to exclude the number where the hundreds place is 1, 2, or 3, the tens place is 1, 2, or 3 and the units place is the same number as the hundreds place, and the tens place is the same as the hundreds place but the units place is not the same as the hundreds place. Since we've already excluded the numbers with the hundreds place of 1, 2, or 3 in the original count of 81, we just need to add the numbers where the hundreds place is 1, 2, or 3, the tens place is the same as the hundreds place and the units place is not the same as the hundreds place.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 1, there are 8 possibilities for the units place (1-9 excluding 1), 1 possibility for the tens place (must be 1),  and 1 possibility for the hundreds place (must be 1). So there are $1 * 8 * 1 = 8$ numbers to exclude.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 2, there are 8 possibilities for the units place (1-9 excluding 2), 1 possibility for the tens place (must be 2), and 1 possibility for the hundreds place (must be 2). So there are $1 * 8 * 1 = 8$ numbers to exclude.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 3, there are 8 possibilities for the units place (1-9 excluding 3), 1 possibility for the tens place (must be 3), and 1 possibility for the hundreds place (must be 3). So there are $1 * 8 * 1 = 8$ numbers to exclude.\n\nSo the total number of these numbers is $8 + 8 + 8 = 24$.\n\nHowever, we have to exclude the numbers where the hundreds place is 1, 2, or 3, the tens place is the same as the hundreds place and the units place is not the same as the hundreds place, and the hundreds place is the same as the tens place and the units place is 1, 2, or 3. Since we've already excluded the numbers with the hundreds place of 1, 2, or 3 in the original count of 81, we just need to add the numbers where the hundreds place is 1, 2, or 3, the tens place is the same as the hundreds place and the units place is not the same as the hundreds place, and the hundreds place is the same as the tens place and the units place is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 1, there are 2 possibilities for the units place (2 or 3), 1 possibility for the tens place (must be 1), and 1 possibility for the hundreds place (must be 1). So there are $1 * 2 * 1 = 2$ numbers to exclude.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 2, there are 2 possibilities for the units place (1 or 3), 1 possibility for the tens place (must be 2), and 1 possibility for the hundreds place (must be 2). So there are $1 * 2 * 1 = 2$ numbers to exclude.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 3, there are 2 possibilities for the units place (1 or 2), 1 possibility for the tens place (must be 3), and 1 possibility for the hundreds place (must be 3). So there are $1 * 2 * 1 = 2$ numbers to exclude.\n\nSo the total number of these numbers is $2 + 2 + 2 = 6$.\n\nHowever, we have to exclude the numbers where the hundreds place is 1, 2, or 3, the tens place is the same as the hundreds place and the units place is not the same as the hundreds place, the hundreds place is the same as the tens place and the units place is 1, 2, or 3, the hundreds place is the same as the units place and the units place is 1, 2, or 3. Since we've already excluded the numbers with the hundreds place of 1, 2, or 3 in the original count of 81, we just need to add the numbers where the hundreds place is 1, 2, or 3, the tens place is the same as the hundreds place and the units place is not the same as the hundreds place, the hundreds place is the same as the tens place and the units place is 1, 2, or 3, the hundreds place is the same as the units place and the units place is 1, 2, or 3.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 1, there is 1 possibility for the tens place (must be 1), 1 possibility for the units place (must be 3), and 1 possibility for the hundreds place (must be 1). So there are $1 * 1 * 1 = 1$ number to exclude.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 2, there is 1 possibility for the tens place (must be 2), 1 possibility for the units place (must be 1), and 1 possibility for the hundreds place (must be 2). So there are $1 * 1 * 1 = 1$ number to exclude.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 3, there is 1 possibility for the tens place (must be 3), 1 possibility for the units place (must be 2), and 1 possibility for the hundreds place (must be 3). So there are $1 * 1 * 1 = 1$ number to exclude.\n\nSo the total number of these numbers is $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of three-digit numbers where exactly two digits are the same but not adjacent. We can calculate the total number of three-digit numbers where exactly two digits are the same but not adjacent as 81 (excluding the numbers with the hundreds place of 1, 2, or 3), + 24 (excluding the numbers with the hundreds place of 1, 2, or 3, the tens place is the same as the hundreds place and the units place is not the same as the hundreds place), + 6 (excluding the numbers with the hundreds place of 1, 2, or 3, the tens place is the same as the hundreds place and the units place is not the same as the hundreds place, the hundreds place is the same as the tens place and the units place is 1, 2, or 3), + 3 (excluding the numbers with the hundreds place of 1, 2, or 3, the tens place is the same as the hundreds place and the units place is not the same as the hundreds place, the hundreds place is the same as the tens place and the units place is 1, 2, or 3, the hundreds place is the same as the units place and the units place is 1, 2, or 3). However, we need to add the number 3 (excluding the numbers with the hundreds place of 1, 2, or 3, the tens place is the same as the hundreds place and the units place is the same as the hundreds place) instead of 3 (excluding the numbers with the hundreds place of 1, 2, or 3, the tens place is the same as the hundreds place and the units place is not the same as the hundreds place, the hundreds place is the same as the tens place and the units place is 1, 2, or 3, the hundreds place is the same as the units place and the units place is 1, 2, or 3) because we've already excluded the numbers with the hundreds place of 1, 2, or 3, the tens place is the same as the hundreds place and the units place is the same as the hundreds place. So the total number of these numbers is $81 + 24 + 6 + 3 = 114$.\n\nHowever, we have to exclude the numbers where the hundreds place is the same as the tens place and the units place is the same as the hundreds place. So for the hundreds place of 1, 2, or 3, there is 1 possibility for the tens place (must be 1, 2, or 3)"
