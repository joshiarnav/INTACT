    "model_solution": "To find the probability that $x+y \\le 4$, we need to determine the ratio of the area where $x+y \\le 4$ to the total area.\n\nFirst, let's find the total area. The total area is a rectangle with a base of 3 and a height of 6. The total area is thus $3 \\times 6 = 18$.\n\nNext, we need to find the area where $x+y \\le 4$. This inequality can be rewritten as $y \\le -x + 4$. We can graph this inequality and find that it is a line with a slope of $-1$ and a y-intercept of 4. The area where $x+y \\le 4$ is thus a trapezoid with a base of 0, 3, and 1, and a height of 4. The area of this trapezoid can be found using the formula $\\frac{h}{2}(b_1 + b_2)$. \n\nPlugging in the values, we get $\\frac{4}{2}(0 + 3) = 2(3) = 6$ for the base 3 to 0 part of the trapezoid and  $\\frac{4}{2}(1+4) = 2(5) = 10$ for the base 4 to 1 part of the trapezoid is incorrect. The part of the trapezoid with base 4 to 1 is a rectangle with a base of 1 and a height of 3. However, to find the total area of the trapezoid, we need to subtract the area of the triangle that is outside of this trapezoid. The area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(1)(3) = \\frac{3}{2}$. \n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 6 + (10 - $\\frac{3}{2}$) = 6 + $\\frac{17}{2}$ = $\\frac{23}{2}$. \n\nThe ratio of the area where $x+y \\le 4$ to the total area is thus $\\frac{\\frac{23}{2}}{18} = \\frac{\\frac{23}{2}}{\\frac{36}{2}} = \\frac{23}{36}$.\n\nSo, the probability that $x+y \\le 4$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{23}{36}}$."
