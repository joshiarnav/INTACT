    "problem": "There are 12 different-colored crayons in a box. How many ways can Karl select four crayons if the order in which he draws them out does not matter?",
    "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of ways Karl can select four crayons from the box, we need to use the combination formula. The combination formula is given by:\n\nnCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to be selected, and ! represents the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 12 (total number of crayons) and r = 4 (number of crayons to be selected).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n12C4 = 12! / (4!(12-4)!)\n= 12! / (4!8!)\n= (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)\n= 11880 / 24\n= 495\n\nSo, Karl can select four crayons from the box in 495 different ways.\n\n$\\boxed{495}$"
