    "problem": "A soccer team has $22$ available players. A fixed set of $11$ players starts the game, while the other $11$ are available as substitutes. During the game, the coach may make as many as $3$ substitutions, where any one of the $11$ players in the game is replaced by one of the substitutes. No player removed from the game may reenter the game, although a substitute entering the game may be replaced later. No two substitutions can happen at the same time. The players involved and the order of the substitutions matter. Let $n$ be the number of ways the coach can make substitutions during the game (including the possibility of making no substitutions). Find the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$.\n",
    "solution": "There are $0-3$ substitutions. The number of ways to sub any number of times must be multiplied by the previous number. This is defined recursively. The case for $0$ subs is $1$, and the ways to reorganize after $n$ subs is the product of the number of new subs ($12-n$) and the players that can be ejected ($11$). The formula for $n$ subs is then $a_n=11(12-n)a_{n-1}$ with $a_0=1$.\nSumming from $0$ to $3$ gives $1+11^2+11^{3}\\cdot 10+11^{4}\\cdot 10\\cdot 9$. Notice that $10+9\\cdot11\\cdot10=10+990=1000$. Then, rearrange it into $1+11^2+11^3\\cdot (10+11\\cdot10\\cdot9)= 1+11^2+11^3\\cdot (1000)$. When taking modulo $1000$, the last term goes away. What is left is $1+11^2=\\boxed{122}$.",

    "model_solution": "The coach can make 0, 1, 2, or 3 substitutions. \n\nIf the coach makes 0 substitutions, there is only 1 way to do this.\n\nIf the coach makes 1 substitution, there are 11 players that can be substituted out and 11 players that can be substituted in, so there are $11\\cdot 11 = 121$ ways.\n\nIf the coach makes 2 substitutions, there are 11 players that can be substituted out first, 10 players that can be substituted out second, 11 players that can be substituted in first, and 10 players that can be substituted in second. So there are $11\\cdot 10\\cdot 11\\cdot 10 = 12100$ ways.\n\nIf the coach makes 3 substitutions, there are 11 players that can be substituted out first, 10 players that can be substituted out second, 9 players that can be substituted out third, 11 players that can be substituted in first, 10 players that can be substituted in second, and 9 players that can be substituted in third. So there are $11\\cdot 10\\cdot 9\\cdot 11\\cdot 10\\cdot 9 = 108900$ ways.\n\nTo find the total number of ways the coach can make substitutions, we add up the number of ways to make 0, 1, 2, or 3 substitutions: $1+121+12100+108900 = 121122$.\n\nTo find the remainder when $121122$ is divided by $1000$, we divide $121122$ by $1000$ to get $121.122$. The remainder is $\\boxed{122}$."
