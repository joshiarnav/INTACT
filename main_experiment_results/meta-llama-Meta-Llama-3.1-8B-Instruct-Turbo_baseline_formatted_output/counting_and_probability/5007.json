    "problem": "What is the largest $2$-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$?\n",
    "solution": "Expanding the binomial coefficient, we get ${200 \\choose 100}=\\frac{200!}{100!100!}$. Let the required prime be $p$; then $10 \\le p < 100$. If $p > 50$, then the factor of $p$ appears twice in the denominator. Thus, we need $p$ to appear as a factor at least three times in the numerator, so $3p<200$. The largest such prime is $\\boxed{61}$, which is our answer.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest 2-digit prime factor of $n = {200\\choose 100}$, we can first express the combination as:\n\n\\[ {200\\choose 100} = \\frac{200!}{100!(200-100)!} = \\frac{200!}{100! \\cdot 100!} \\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[ {200\\choose 100} = \\frac{200 \\cdot 199 \\cdot 198 \\cdot 197 \\cdot 198 \\cdot ... \\cdot 101 \\cdot 100}{100 \\cdot 99 \\cdot 98 \\cdot 97 \\cdot 96 \\cdot ... \\cdot 1} \\]\n\nNotice that many factors in the numerator cancel with factors in the denominator.  This means that we only need to consider the prime factors of the remaining numerator. Let's find the prime factorization of the numerator:\n\n\\[ 200 \\cdot 199 \\cdot 198 \\cdot 197 \\cdot ... \\cdot 101 \\cdot 100 = 2^{100} \\cdot 3^{33} \\cdot 5^{20} \\cdot 7^8 \\cdot 11^5 \\cdot 13^4 \\cdot 17^3 \\cdot 19^2 \\cdot 23 \\cdot 29 \\cdot 31^2 \\cdot 37 \\cdot 41 \\cdot 43 \\cdot 47 \\cdot 53 \\cdot 59 \\cdot 61 \\cdot 67 \\cdot 71 \\cdot 73 \\cdot 79 \\cdot 83 \\cdot 89 \\cdot 97 \\]\n\nThe prime factors that we see here are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ..., 97.  The smallest prime factor of 200 choose 100 is 2. The largest 2-digit prime factor of 200 choose 100 is 97.\n\nHowever, there is one further 2-digit prime factor of 200 choose 100 that is not listed above.  This prime factor is 89,   that is larger than 97,  is not correct, My mistake.   So we can say that 89 is large prime factor but not the largest. However 89 is a 2-digit prime factor greater than 97."
