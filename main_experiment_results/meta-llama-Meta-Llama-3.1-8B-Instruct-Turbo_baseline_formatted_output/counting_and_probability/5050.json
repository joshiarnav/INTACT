    "solution": "Let the two disjoint subsets be $A$ and $B$, and let $C = S-(A+B)$. For each $i \\in S$, either $i \\in A$, $i \\in B$, or $i \\in C$. So there are $3^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ into disjoint $A$, $B$, and $C$.\nHowever, there are $2^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ such that $A = \\emptyset$ and $S = B+C$, and there are $2^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ such that $B = \\emptyset$ and $S = A+C$. But, the combination such that $A = B = \\emptyset$ and $S = C$ is counted twice.\nThus, there are $3^{10}-2\\cdot2^{10}+1$ ordered pairs of sets $(A,B)$. But since the question asks for the number of unordered sets $\\{ A,B \\}$, $n = \\frac{1}{2}(3^{10}-2\\cdot2^{10}+1) = 28501 \\equiv \\boxed{501} \\pmod{1000}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of sets of two non-empty disjoint subsets of $\\mathcal{S}$, we can use the concept of the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nFirst, we can count the number of ordered pairs of disjoint subsets of $\\mathcal{S}$ and then divide by $2$ to get the number of unordered pairs.\n\nFor each element in $\\mathcal{S}$, there are $4$ possibilities for where it can be placed in the two subsets: in the first subset, in the second subset, in both subsets, or in neither subset.\n\nThis gives a total of $4^{10}$ ordered pairs of disjoint subsets. However, this counts the case where one subset is empty and the other is non-empty, which is not allowed by the problem statement. We must subtract this from our total.\n\nThere are $2^{10}$ ordered pairs of disjoint subsets where exactly one of the subsets is empty, and these are counted twice.\n\nThere are $2^{10}$ ordered pairs of disjoint subsets where both subsets are empty, but this case doesn't contribute to the unordered pairs.\n\nWe must also add back the cases where both subsets are empty, since we counted them three times, but they don't contribute to the unordered pairs.\n\nUsing the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the number of unordered pairs of disjoint subsets of $\\mathcal{S}$ is\n\n$$\\frac{4^{10}-2\\cdot2^{10}}{2} = 2^{10}\\cdot \\frac{2^{10}-2}{2} = 2^{10}\\cdot (2^9 - 1)$$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the remainder of this number divided by $1000$:\n\n$$2^{10}\\cdot (2^9 - 1) = 1024 \\cdot 511 = 523984$$.\n\nThus, the remainder obtained when $n$ is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{024}$"
