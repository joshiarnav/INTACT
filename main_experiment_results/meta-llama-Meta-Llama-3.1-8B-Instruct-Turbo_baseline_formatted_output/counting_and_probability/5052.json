They fall into three categories: there are those which are entirely contained within a single face of the cube (whose sides are two edges and one face diagonal), those which lie in a plane perpendicular to one face of the cube (whose sides are one edge, one face diagonal and one space diagonal of the cube) and those which lie in a plane oblique to the edges of the cube, whose sides are three face diagonals of the cube.\nEach face of the cube contains ${4\\choose 3} = 4$ triangles of the first type, and there are $6$ faces, so there are $24$ triangles of the first type. Each of these is a right triangle with legs of length $1$, so each triangle of the first type has area $\\frac 12$.\nEach edge of the cube is a side of exactly $2$ of the triangles of the second type, and there are $12$ edges, so there are $24$ triangles of the second type. Each of these is a right triangle with legs of length $1$ and $\\sqrt 2$, so each triangle of the second type has area $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nEach vertex of the cube is associated with exactly one triangle of the third type (whose vertices are its three neighbors), and there are $8$ vertices of the cube, so there are $8$ triangles of the third type. Each of the these is an equilateral triangle with sides of length $\\sqrt 2$, so each triangle of the third type has area $\\frac{\\sqrt 3}2$.\nThus the total area of all these triangles is $24 \\cdot \\frac12 + 24\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt2}2 + 8\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt3}2 = 12 + 12\\sqrt2 + 4\\sqrt3 = 12 + \\sqrt{288} + \\sqrt{48}$ and the answer is $12 + 288 + 48 = \\boxed{348}$.",
