    "problem": "The cards in a stack of $2n$ cards are numbered consecutively from 1 through $2n$ from top to bottom. The top $n$ cards are removed, kept in order, and form pile $A.$ The remaining cards form pile $B.$ The cards are then restacked by taking cards alternately from the tops of pile $B$ and $A,$ respectively. In this process, card number $(n+1)$ becomes the bottom card of the new stack, card number 1 is on top of this card, and so on, until piles $A$ and $B$ are exhausted. If, after the restacking process, at least one card from each pile occupies the same position that it occupied in the original stack, the stack is named magical. For example, eight cards form a magical stack because cards number 3 and number 6 retain their original positions. Find the number of cards in the magical stack in which card number 131 retains its original position.\n",
    "solution": "Since a card from B is placed on the bottom of the new stack, notice that cards from pile B will be marked as an even number in the new pile, while cards from pile A will be marked as odd in the new pile. Since 131 is odd and retains its original position in the stack, it must be in pile A. Also to retain its original position, exactly $131 - 1 = 130$ numbers must be in front of it. There are $\\frac{130}{2} = 65$ cards from each of piles A, B in front of card 131. This suggests that $n = 131 + 65 = 196$; the total number of cards is $196 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{392}$.",

    "model_solution": "Since card number 131 retains its original position, it must be placed in the new stack in such a way that it still retains its original position. \n\nCard 131 is the 131st card in the original stack. Since the new stack is formed by alternating cards from piles B and A, we can find the position of card 131 in the new stack as follows:\n\n- The first card from pile B is card number (n+1), which becomes the bottom card of the new stack.\n- The first card from pile A is card number 1.\n- The second card from pile B is card number (n+2), which becomes the second card from the bottom of the new stack.\n- The second card from pile A is card number 2.\n- The third card from pile B is card number (n+3), which becomes the third card from the bottom of the new stack.\n- The third card from pile A is card number 3.\n- This pattern continues, with the ith card from pile B being card number (n+i) and the ith card from pile A being card number i.\n\nCard 131 is in pile A, since it is between 1 and n. Since card 131 retains its original position, it must be placed in the new stack in the same position as in the original stack. This means that card 131 is in the 131st position in the new stack.\n\nSince the new stack is formed by alternating cards from piles B and A, card 131 must be placed in an odd position in the new stack. Since card 131 is in pile A, it must be preceded by an even number of cards from pile B in the new stack.\n\nThe number of cards from pile B that precede card 131 in the new stack is equal to the number of cards from pile A that precede card 131 in the new stack. Therefore, the number of cards from pile A that precede card 131 in the new stack is also 65.\n\nSince card 131 is the 131st card in the new stack, and 65 cards from pile A precede it, there must be 65 cards from pile A in the new stack. Since the first card from pile A is card number 1, the last card from pile A is card number 65.\n\nSince the new stack has 2n cards, the number of cards from pile A in the new stack is n. Therefore, n = 65.\n\nSince the number of cards in the original stack is 2n, the number of cards in the magical stack is 2n = 2*65 = 130.\n\nHowever,  the question asks for the number of cards in the magical stack which contains card 131, this is 2 times n, since 131 is between 1 and n. Thus the correct answer is 2n = 2*197 = 394."
