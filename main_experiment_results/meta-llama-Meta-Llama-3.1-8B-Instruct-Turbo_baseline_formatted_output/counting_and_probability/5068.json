    "problem": "Seven teams play a soccer tournament in which each team plays every other team exactly once. No ties occur, each team has a $50\\%$ chance of winning each game it plays, and the outcomes of the games are independent. In each game, the winner is awarded a point and the loser gets 0 points. The total points are accumilated to decide the ranks of the teams. In the first game of the tournament, team $A$ beats team $B.$ The probability that team $A$ finishes with more points than team $B$ is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$\n",
    "solution": "The results of the five remaining games are independent of the first game, so by symmetry, the probability that $A$ scores higher than $B$ in these five games is equal to the probability that $B$ scores higher than $A$. We let this probability be $p$; then the probability that $A$ and $B$ end with the same score in these five games is $1-2p$.\nOf these three cases ($|A| > |B|, |A| < |B|, |A|=|B|$), the last is the easiest to calculate (see solution 2 for a way to directly calculate the other cases).\nThere are ${5\\choose k}$ ways to $A$ to have $k$ victories, and ${5\\choose k}$ ways for $B$ to have $k$ victories. Summing for all values of $k$,\n$1-2p = \\frac{1}{2^{5} \\times 2^{5}}\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{5} {5\\choose k}^2\\right) = \\frac{1^2+5^2+10^2+10^2+5^2+1^2}{1024} = \\frac{126}{512}.$\nThus $p = \\frac 12 \\left(1-\\frac{126}{512}\\right) = \\frac{193}{512}$. The desired probability is the sum of the cases when $|A| \\ge |B|$, so the answer is $\\frac{126}{512} + \\frac{193}{512} = \\frac{319}{512}$, and $m+n = \\boxed{831}$.",

This includes the possibility that team $A$ wins all games and team $B$ loses all of them (except for the first game, where team $A$ wins).\n\nSince there are $7$ teams and each team plays every other team once, the total number of games is ${7\\choose2}=21.$\n\nThe probability that team $A$ wins all the games and team $B$ loses all the games (except for the first one) can be expressed as $\\frac{1}{2^6}$.\n\nHowever, there are ${5\\choose2}=10$ different scenarios where team $A$ wins all the games and team $B$ loses all the games (except for the first one). \n\nThe probability that team $A$ wins all the games and team $B$ wins at least one game can be expressed as ${5\\choose2}\\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^6= \\frac{10}{64}$.\n\nNow we need to consider cases where team $A$ wins $6$ games and loses $1$ game, and team $B$ loses $1$ game and wins the remaining $5$ games. \n\nThere are ${6\\choose1}=6$ ways for team $A$ to lose a game, and ${5\\choose1}=5$ ways for team $B$ to win a game.\n\nThe probability that team $A$ wins $6$ games and loses $1$ game, and team $B$ loses $1$ game and wins the remaining $5$ games, can be expressed as ${6\\choose1}{5\\choose1}\\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{10} = \\frac{30}{1024}$.\n\nNext, consider the cases where team $A$ wins $5$ games and team $B$ wins $2$ games.\n\nThere are ${7\\choose1}=7$ ways for team $A$ to lose two games, ${6\\choose2}=15$ ways for team $A$ to lose one game and team $B$ to lose one game, and ${5\\choose2}=10$ ways for team $B$ to lose two games.\n\nThe probability that team $A$ wins $5$ games and team $B$ wins $2$ games, can be expressed as ${7\\choose1}{5\\choose2}\\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{10} = \\frac{35}{512}.$\n\nNext, consider the cases where team $A$ wins $4$ games and team $B$ wins $3$ games.\n\nThere are ${7\\choose2}=21$ ways for team $A$ to lose $3$ games and ${6\\choose3}=20$ ways for team $A$ to lose $2$ games and team $B$ to lose $1$ game.\n\nThe probability that team $A$ wins $4$ games and team $B$ wins $3$ games, can be expressed as ${7\\choose2}{4\\choose3}\\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{10} = \\frac{35}{256}.$\n\nNext, consider the cases where team $A$ wins $4$ games and team $B$ wins $4$ games.\n\nThere are ${6\\choose2}=15$ ways for team $A$ to lose $2$ games and ${5\\choose2}=10$ ways for team $A$ to lose $1$ game and team $B$ to lose $1$ game.\n\nThe probability that team $A$ wins $4$ games and team $B$ wins $4$ games, can be expressed as ${6\\choose2}{4\\choose2}\\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{10} = \\frac{75}{512}.$\n\nFinally, consider the cases where team $A$ wins $3$ games or fewer and team $B$ wins $4$ games or more.\n\nThe probability that team $A$ wins $3$ games or fewer and team $B$ wins $4$ games or more, can be expressed as $\\frac{1}{64}+ \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{5}{64} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{5}{64} = \\frac{1}{32}.$\n\nNow we can sum up all the probabilities:\n\n$\\frac{10}{64} + \\frac{30}{1024} + \\frac{35}{512} + \\frac{35}{256} + \\frac{75}{512} + \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{63}{256}.$\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{319}$"
