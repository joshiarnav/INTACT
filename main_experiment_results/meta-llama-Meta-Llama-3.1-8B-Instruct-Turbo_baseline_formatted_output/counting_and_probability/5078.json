    "problem": "There are two distinguishable flagpoles, and there are $19$ flags, of which $10$ are identical blue flags, and $9$ are identical green flags. Let $N$ be the number of distinguishable arrangements using all of the flags in which each flagpole has at least one flag and no two green flags on either pole are adjacent. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n",
    "solution": "The well known problem of ordering $x$ elements of a string of $y$ elements such that none of the $x$ elements are next to each other has ${y-x+1\\choose x}$ solutions. (1)\nWe generalize for $a$ blues and $b$ greens. Consider a string of $a+b$ elements such that we want to choose the greens such that none of them are next to each other. We would also like to choose a place where we can divide this string into two strings such that the left one represents the first pole, and the right one represents the second pole, in order up the pole according to position on the string.\nHowever, this method does not account for the fact that the first pole could end with a green, and the second pole could start with a green, since the original string assumed that no greens could be consecutive. We solve this problem by introducing an extra blue, such that we choose our divider by choosing one of these $a+1$ blues, and not including that one as a flag on either pole.\nFrom (1), we now have ${a+2\\choose b}$ ways to order the string such that no greens are next to each other, and $a+1$ ways to choose the extra blue that will divide the string into the two poles: or $(a+1){a+2\\choose b}$ orderings in total.\nHowever, we have overcounted the solutions where either pole has no flags, we have to count these separately. This is the same as choosing our extra blue as one of the two ends, and ordering the other $a$ blues and $b$ greens such that no greens are next to each other: for a total of $2{a+1\\choose b}$ such orderings.\nThus, we have $(a+1){a+2\\choose b}-2{a+1\\choose b}$ orderings that satisfy the conditions in the problem: plugging in $a=10$ and $b=9$, we get $2310 \\equiv \\boxed{310} \\pmod{1000}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will use recursion and the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE).\n\nFirst, let's order the $9$ green flags and the $10$ blue flags, so we have a string of $19$ flags. There are $19!$ possible orderings of the flags.\n\nNow, let's place the first green flag. We have $19$ choices for its position. \n\nHowever, the first green flag cannot be adjacent to another green flag. This is a problem because when we place the second green flag, we will have to skip over one position to ensure that it is not adjacent to the first green flag. Similarly, when we place the third green flag, we will have to skip over two positions, and so on.\n\nSo, when we place the $k^{th}$ green flag, we will have to skip over $k-1$ positions. This means that the $k^{th}$ green flag will have to be placed between the $(k-1)^{th}$ and the $(k+1)^{th}$ blue flags. There are $10-k$ possible positions for the $k^{th}$ green flag.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to place the $9$ green flags is $19\\cdot 18\\cdot 17\\cdot 16\\cdot 15\\cdot 14\\cdot 13\\cdot 12\\cdot 11$.\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer. We have counted some invalid orderings. For example, when we place the second green flag, we should not have placed the first green flag in the position right before the second green flag. We have counted this ordering twice.\n\nTo correct this, we will use PIE. We will count the orderings where at least one of the green flags is adjacent to another green flag, and then subtract this count from the total count.\n\nLet $A_k$ be the set of orderings where the $k^{th}$ green flag is adjacent to another green flag. We have $|A_k|=10-k$. We also have $|A_k \\cap A_j|=10-k-j$, for $k<j$.\n\nNow, let $A$ be the set of orderings where at least one of the green flags is adjacent to another green flag. We have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n|A|&=\\sum_{k=1}^9 |A_k| - \\sum_{1\\le k < j\\le 9} |A_k \\cap A_j| + \\sum_{1\\le k < j < t\\le 9} |A_k \\cap A_j \\cap A_t|\\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=1}^9 (10-k) - \\sum_{1\\le k < j\\le 9} (10-k-j) + \\sum_{1\\le k < j < t\\le 9} (10-k-j-t)\\\\\n&=9\\cdot 10 - \\sum_{k=1}^8 k - \\sum_{1\\le k < j\\le 8} (j-k) + \\sum_{1\\le k < j < t\\le 8} (t-k-j)\\\\\n&=90-55-54+39\\\\\n&=20.\n\\end{align*}\n\nHowever, this count is not accurate. When we place the $k^{th}$ green flag, we have to skip over $k-1$ positions. This means that the $k^{th}$ green flag will have to be placed between the $(k-1)^{th}$ and the $(k+1)^{th}$ blue flags.
