    "problem": "A mother purchases 5 blue plates, 2 red plates, 2 green plates, and 1 orange plate. How many ways are there for her to arrange these plates for dinner around her circular table if she doesn't want the 2 green plates to be adjacent?\n",
    "solution": "We apply the complement principle: we find the total number of cases in which the 2 green places are adjacent, and subtract from the total number of cases.\nThere are $\\frac{10!}{5!2!2!1!} = 7560$ ways to arrange the plates in a linear fashion. However, since the plates are arranged in a circle, there are $10$ ways to rotate the plates, and so there are $7560/10 = 756$ ways to arrange the plates in a circular fashion (consider, for example, fixing the orange plate at the top of the table).\nIf the two green plates are adjacent, we may think of them as a single entity, so that there are now $9$ objects to be placed around the table in a circular fashion. Using the same argument, there are $\\frac{9!}{5!2!1!1!} = 1512$ ways to arrange the objects in a linear fashion, and $1512/9 = 168$ ways in a circular fashion.\nThus, the answer is $756 - 168 = \\boxed{588}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of arrangements of the plates and then subtract the number of arrangements where the 2 green plates are adjacent.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of arrangements. Since the plates are arranged in a circle, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of plates to account for the circular symmetry. \n\nThe total number of arrangements is given by the formula for permutations of objects with repetition, which is:\n\nTotal number of arrangements = (Total number of plates - 1)! / (Number of blue plates! * Number of red plates! * Number of green plates! * Number of orange plates!)\n\nTotal number of plates = 5 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 10\nTotal number of arrangements = (10 - 1)! / (5! * 2! * 2! * 1!)\n= 9! / (5! * 2! * 2!)\n= 362,880 / (120 * 2 * 2)\n= 362,880 / 480\n= 756\n\nHowever, we need to consider that there are 2 green plates. Since they are identical, we have divided by 2! twice. But in this case, we need to consider the green plates as one entity and thus we do not divide by 2! twice.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of arrangements where the 2 green plates are adjacent. To do this, we treat the 2 green plates as one entity, which we can call a \"green block\". We now have 9 entities: 5 blue plates, 2 red plates, 1 orange plate, and 1 green block. \n\nThe number of arrangements of these 9 entities is given by:\n\nNumber of arrangements with green plates adjacent = (9 - 1)! / (5! * 2! * 1!)\n= 8! / (5! * 2!)\n= 40,320 / (120 * 2)\n= 40,320 / 240\n= 168\n\nHowever, we need to consider that there are 2 green plates and they can be arranged in 2! ways within the green block. So, we need to multiply the number of arrangements by 2!.\n\nNumber of arrangements with green plates adjacent = 168 * 2!\n= 168 * 2\n= 336\n\nNow, we subtract the number of arrangements where the 2 green plates are adjacent from the total number of arrangements:\n\nNumber of arrangements where green plates are not adjacent = Total number of arrangements - Number of arrangements with green plates adjacent\n= 756 - 336\n= 420\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n\n$\\boxed{420}$"
