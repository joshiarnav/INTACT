    "problem": "A paperboy delivers newspapers to 10 houses along Main Street. Wishing to save effort, he doesn't always deliver to every house, but to avoid being fired he never misses three consecutive houses. Compute the number of ways the paperboy could deliver papers in this manner.\n",
    "solution": "We can find a recursion. Let $D_n$ be the number of legal delivery sequences for $n$ houses. If a sequence ends with a delivery, we simply append one to $D_{n - 1}$. If it ends in $1$ nondelivery, we append a nondelivery and a delivery to $D_{n - 2}$. If it ends in $2$ nondeliveries, we append them and a delivery to $D_{n - 3}$. So\n$D_n = D_{n - 1} + D_{n - 2} + D_{n - 3}$.\nThus, since clearly $D_1 = 2$, $D_2 = 4$, $D_3 = 7$, we have $D_4 = 13$, $D_5 = 24$, $D_6 = 44$, $D_7 = 81$, $D_8 = 149$, $D_9 = 274$, $D_{10} = \\boxed{504}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. Let's define $a_n$ as the number of ways the paperboy can deliver papers to $n$ houses without missing three consecutive houses.\n\nFor $n = 1$, there are $2$ ways (deliver or not deliver). For $n = 2$, there are $4$ ways (deliver-deliver, deliver-not deliver, not deliver-deliver, not deliver-not deliver). For $n = 3$, there are $7$ ways (deliver-deliver-deliver, deliver-deliver-not deliver, deliver-not deliver-deliver, deliver-not deliver-not deliver, not deliver-deliver-deliver, not deliver-deliver-not deliver, not deliver-not deliver-deliver).\n\nWe can start a recursive formula as follows: \n- If the paperboy delivers to the $n^{th}$ house, there are $a_{n-1}$ ways he can deliver to the remaining houses.\n- If the paperboy does not deliver to the $n^{th}$ house but delivers to the $(n-1)^{th}$ house, there are $a_{n-2}$ ways he can deliver to the remaining houses.\n- If the paperboy does not deliver to the $n^{th}$ house and the $(n-1)^{th}$ house but delivers to the $(n-2)^{th}$ house, there are $a_{n-3}$ ways he can deliver to the remaining houses.\n\nHowever, to avoid missing three consecutive houses, the last two cases can be combined into one case (not deliver to the $n^{th}$ house and the $(n-1)^{th}$ house) which will be included in the $a_{n-2}$ case, since the paperboy can't miss three houses.\n\nHence, we get the following recursive formula: \n$a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$.\n\nWe can find the values of $a_n$ iteratively:\n$a_1 = 2$\n$a_2 = 4$\n$a_3 = 7$\n$a_4 = a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = 7 + 4 + 2 = 13$\n$a_5 = a_4 + a_3 + a_2 = 13 + 7 + 4 = 24$\n$a_6 = a_5 + a_4 + a_3 = 24 + 13 + 7 = 44$\n$a_7 = a_6 + a_5 + a_4 = 44 + 24 + 13 = 81$\n$a_8 = a_7 + a_6 + a_5 = 81 + 44 + 24 = 149$\n$a_9 = a_8 + a_7 + a_6 = 149 + 81 + 44 = 274$\n$a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 + a_7 = 274 + 149 + 81 = 504$.\n\nThe number of ways the paperboy could deliver papers to 10 houses is $\\boxed{504}$."
