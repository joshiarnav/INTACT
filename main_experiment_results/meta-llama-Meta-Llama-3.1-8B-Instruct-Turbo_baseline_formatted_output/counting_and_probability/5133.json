    "problem": "How many 10-digit positive integers have all digits either 1 or 2, and have two consecutive 1's?\n",
    "solution": "We take as our universe the set of 10-digit integers whose digits are all either 1 or 2, of which there are $2^{10}$, and we count the complement. The complement is the set of 10-digit positive integers composed of the digits 1 and 2 with no two consecutive 1s. Counting such numbers is a popular combinatorial problem: we approach it via a recursion.\nThere are two \"good\" one-digit numbers (1 and 2) and three good two-digit numbers (12, 21 and 22). Each such $n$-digit number is formed either by gluing \"2\" on to the end of a good $(n - 1)$-digit number or by gluing \"21\" onto the end of a good $(n - 2)$-digit number. This is a bijection between the good $n$-digit numbers and the union of the good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. Thus, the number of good $n$-digit numbers is the sum of the number of good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. The resulting recursion is exactly that of the Fibonacci numbers with initial values $F_1 = 2$ and $F_2 = 3$.\nThus, our final answer is $2^{10} - F_{10} = 1024 - 144 = \\boxed{880}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll use the technique of complementary counting. \n\nLet a(n) be the number of n-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2 and no two consecutive 1's. \n\nNow, we will find a recursive formula for a(n). \n\nIf the first digit of such a number is 2, there are a(n-1) possibilities for the remaining digits. \n\nIf the first digit of such a number is 1, then the second digit must be 2, and there are a(n-2) possibilities for the remaining digits. \n\nTherefore, a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2).\n\nWe can also find the base cases for this recursion. \n\na(1) = 2 (Since a 1-digit number with all digits 1 or 2 is 1 or 2) \na(2) = 3 (Since a 2-digit number with all digits 1 or 2 and no two consecutive 1's is 22, 12, or 21) \n\nWe can now find the number of n-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2 and have two consecutive 1's. \n\nThe number of n-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2 is 2^n. \n\nSo, the number of n-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2 and have two consecutive 1's is 2^n - a(n).\n\nNow we need to find the value of a(n). \n\nThe sequence a(n) is a well-known sequence called the Fibonacci sequence but shifted by one position (each term is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 3, 2). \n\nHowever, since we want to find the number of n-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2 and have two consecutive 1's, we need to calculate the value of a(n) for n=10. \n\na(1) = 2, a(2) = 3. \n\na(3) = a(2) + a(1) = 3 + 2 = 5. \n\na(4) = a(3) + a(2) = 5 + 3 = 8. \n\na(5) = a(4) + a(3) = 8 + 5 = 13. \n\na(6) = a(5) + a(4) = 13 + 8 = 21. \n\na(7) = a(6) + a(5) = 21 + 13 = 34. \n\na(8) = a(7) + a(6) = 34 + 21 = 55. \n\na(9) = a(8) + a(7) = 55 + 34 = 89. \n\na(10) = a(9) + a(8) = 89 + 55 = 144. \n\nThe number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2 and have two consecutive 1's is 2^10 - a(10) = 1024 - 144 = 880.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{880}$."
