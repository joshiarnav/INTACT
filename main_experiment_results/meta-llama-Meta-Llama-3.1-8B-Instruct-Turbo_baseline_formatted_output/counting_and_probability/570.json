    "problem": "If Greg rolls four fair six-sided dice, what is the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's?",
    "solution": "We notice that the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's must equal the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's. So, we can find the probability that Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's, subtract it from 1, and divide by 2 to find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's. There are three ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's: he can roll two of each, one of each, or none of each. If he rolls two of each, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which two dice roll the 1's. If he rolls one of each, there are $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1}=12$ ways to choose which dice are the 6 and the 1, and for each of those ways there are $4\\cdot4=16$ ways to choose the values of the other dice. If Greg rolls no 1's or 6's, there are $4^4=256$ possible values for the dice. In total, there are $6+12\\cdot16+256=454$ ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's. There are $6^4=1296$ total ways the four dice can roll, so the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\left(1-\\dfrac{454}{1296}\\right)=\\boxed{\\dfrac{421}{1296}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's, we can consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Combinations with 4 dice**: Each die has 6 possible outcomes. With 4 dice, the total number of combinations is $6^4 = 1296$.\n\n2. **Equally likely outcomes**: Each combination is equally likely since each die has an equal chance of landing on any number.\n\n3. **Symmetry argument**: We can use a symmetry argument to find the probability. Let $P$ be the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's. Then, the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's is also $P$. This is because the probability of rolling a 1 is the same as the probability of rolling a 6.\n\n4. **Probability of rolling an equal number of 1's and 6's**: If Greg rolls two of each, there are ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ combinations that satisfy this (as he can pick any two dice to be the 6's and the other two to be the 1's). Thus, the probability that he rolls an equal number of 1's and 6's is $\\dfrac{6}{1296} = \\dfrac{1}{216}$.\n\n5. **Probability of rolling more 1's than 6's**: Since the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's and the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's are both equal to $P$, and the probability of rolling an equal number of 1's and 6's is $\\dfrac{1}{216}$, the sum of the probabilities is equal to 1. Thus, we have: \n\n$$2P + \\dfrac{1}{216} = 1$$\n\nNow, solving for $P$:\n\n$$2P = 1 - \\dfrac{1}{216}$$\n\n$$2P = \\dfrac{216 - 1}{216}$$\n\n$$2P = \\dfrac{215}{216}$$\n\n$$P = \\dfrac{215}{432}$$\n\nThe probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{215}{432}}$."
