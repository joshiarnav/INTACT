    "problem": "An integer greater than 9 and less than 100 is randomly chosen. What is the probability that its digits are different?",
    "solution": "We calculate the probability that the digits are the same, and subtract from 1. From the 90 integers to be chosen from, only 9 have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, ..., 99. Therefore, the probability that the digits are the same is $\\frac{9}{90} = \\frac{1}{10}$, so the probability that the digits are different is $1-\\frac{1}{10}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the digits of a randomly chosen two-digit number are different, we first need to count the total number of two-digit numbers and the number of two-digit numbers with different digits.\n\nThere are 90 two-digit numbers (from 10 to 99).\n\nTo count the number of two-digit numbers with different digits, we can first count the numbers with identical digits. There are 9 numbers with identical digits (11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99).\n\nSo, the number of two-digit numbers with different digits is 90 - 9 = 81.\n\nThe probability that its digits are different is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n\nProbability = (Number of two-digit numbers with different digits) / (Total number of two-digit numbers)\nProbability = 81 / 90\nProbability = 9 / 10\n\nTherefore, the probability is $\\boxed{0.9}$"
