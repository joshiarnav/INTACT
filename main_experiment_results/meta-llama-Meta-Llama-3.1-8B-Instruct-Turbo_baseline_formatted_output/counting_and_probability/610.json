    "problem": "Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards (13 hearts, 13 clubs, 13 spades, and 13 diamonds).  What is the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen?",
    "solution": "The probability that the first card is a 6 is $\\dfrac{1}{13}$.  There are then 51 cards remaining, so the probability the second card is a Queen is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  The answer is then $\\dfrac{1}{13} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{663}}$.",

    "model_solution": "There are 4 sixes in a standard deck of 52 cards (one for each suit: hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds). The probability of drawing a 6 as the first card is $\\frac{4}{52}$ or $\\frac{1}{13}$. \n\nAfter drawing a 6, there are 51 cards remaining in the deck. There are 4 Queens in the deck. The probability of drawing a Queen as the second card is $\\frac{4}{51}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both events occurring is the product of the individual probabilities: \n\n$\\frac{1}{13} \\times \\frac{4}{51}$\n\n= $\\frac{4}{663}$\n\nSo the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{663}}$."
