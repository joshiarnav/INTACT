    "problem": "Crestview's school colors are purple and gold. The students are designing a flag using three solid-colored horizontal stripes, as shown. Using one or both of the school colors, how many different flags are possible if adjacent stripes may be the same color?\n\n[asy]\nsize(75);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,12));\ndot((0,12));\ndraw((0,12)--(8,12)--(8,11)--(0,11));\ndraw((8,11)--(8,9)--(0,9));\ndraw((8,9)--(8,6)--(0,6));\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "There are two possible colors for the first stripe, two possible colors for the second stripe, and two possible colors for the third stripe. Since the colors of each stripe are mutually exclusive, there are $2\\times 2 \\times 2 = \\boxed{8}$ ways to color the flag.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total number of different flags possible, we can use the concept of combinations and permutations.\n\nFor the top stripe, there are 2 options (purple or gold). \nFor the middle stripe, there are also 2 options (purple or gold). \nFor the bottom stripe, there are also 2 options (purple or gold).\n\nUsing the multiplication principle, we can multiply the number of options for each stripe to find the total number of flags possible.\n\n2 (top stripe) * 2 (middle stripe) * 2 (bottom stripe) = 8\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{8}$ different flags possible using one or both of the school colors."
