    "problem": "Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace?",
    "solution": "We have two cases because if the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$, it could be an ace or not be an ace.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{3}{51} = \\dfrac{1}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the three remaining aces, which gives a probability of $\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot \\dfrac{1}{17} = \\dfrac{1}{884}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{12}{52} = \\dfrac{3}{13}$ chance that a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the ace is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{4}{51}$ chance that an ace is drawn second, giving a $\\dfrac{3}{13}\\cdot \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{4}{221}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nSo the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\\dfrac{1}{884} + \\dfrac{4}{221} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}$.\n\nNotice that we can avoid some of the large denominators above by organizing this computation as follows: $$\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{3}{51}+\\dfrac{12}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{1\\cdot 3+12\\cdot 4}{52\\cdot 51} = \\dfrac{51}{52\\cdot 51}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}.$$",

    "model_solution": "There are two possible scenarios for the first card being a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card being an ace.\n\n1. The first card is an ace of diamonds, and the second card is an ace. \n\nThe probability of the first card being the ace of diamonds is $\\frac{1}{52}$. The probability of the second card being an ace is $\\frac{3}{51}$ since there are 3 remaining aces in a deck of 51 cards.\n\nSo the probability of this scenario is $\\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51}$.\n\n2. The first card is a diamond, but not an ace, and the second card is an ace.\n\nThe probability of the first card being a diamond but not an ace is $\\frac{12}{52}$. The probability of the second card being an ace is $\\frac{4}{51}$ since there are 4 aces in a deck of 51 cards.\n\nSo the probability of this scenario is $\\frac{12}{52} \\times \\frac{4}{51}$.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is the sum of the two scenarios: \n\n$\\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51} + \\frac{12}{52} \\times \\frac{4}{51} = \\frac{3}{2652} + \\frac{48}{2652} = \\frac{51}{2652}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{52}}$"
