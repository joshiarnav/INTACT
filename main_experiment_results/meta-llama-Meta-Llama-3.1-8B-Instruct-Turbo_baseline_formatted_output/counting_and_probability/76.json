    "problem": "Seven people arrive to dinner, but the circular table only seats six.  If two seatings such that one is a rotation of the other are considered the same, then in how many different ways can we choose six people and seat them at the table?",
    "solution": "There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing.  To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person.  This suggests that there are $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people.  However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count.  Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table.  There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we first need to choose 6 people out of 7. This can be done in $\\binom{7}{6}=7$ ways. \n\nOnce we have chosen 6 people, we need to consider the different ways to seat them at the table. Since the table is circular, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of rotations. \n\nThe total number of arrangements can be calculated as 6!, since there are 6 people and 6 seats. However, we need to divide this by 6 to account for the rotations, since each arrangement has 6 rotations that are considered the same.\n\nSo, the total number of different ways to seat 6 people at the table is $7 \\cdot \\frac{6!}{6}$. \n\nThis simplifies to $7 \\cdot 5! = 7 \\cdot (5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1) = 7 \\cdot 120 = 840.$\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{840}$."
