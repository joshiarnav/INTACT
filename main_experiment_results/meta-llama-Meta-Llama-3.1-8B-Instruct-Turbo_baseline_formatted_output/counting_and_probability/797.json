    "problem": "A math conference is presenting a lecture series with six different lecturers. If Dr. Smith's lecture depends on Dr. Jones's lecture, so that Dr. Smith must be scheduled at some time after Dr. Jones, in how many orders can the six lecturers be scheduled?",
    "solution": "There are a total of $6!$ ways to order the 6 lectures with no restriction. By symmetry, exactly half of these will have Dr. Jones's lecture before Dr. Smith's lecture. Thus there are $6!/2 = \\boxed{360}$ ways to schedule the conference.",
    "total_tokens": 510,
    "time_taken": 4.65904688835144,
    "file_name": "./MATH_subsample_uniform/counting_and_probability/797.json",
    "model_solution": "There are 6 different lecturers and 6 time slots. If there were no restrictions, the number of ways to schedule the 6 lecturers would be 6! (6 factorial), which is equal to 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720.\n\nHowever, since Dr. Smith's lecture must be scheduled after Dr. Jones's lecture, we have to consider this restriction. We can count the number of ways to schedule the 6 lecturers where Dr. Smith is scheduled before Dr. Jones, and then subtract this from the total number of possible schedules.\n\nIf Dr. Smith is scheduled before Dr. Jones, we can treat them as a single \"unit\" and schedule this \"unit\" along with the other 4 lecturers. There are 5! ways to schedule these 5 \"units\" (since the order of the 2 lecturers within the \"unit\" doesn't matter). For each of these 5! schedules, there are 2 ways to order Dr. Smith and Dr. Jones (either Dr. Smith before Dr. Jones or Dr. Jones before Dr. Smith), so there are 2 x 5! schedules where Dr. Smith is scheduled before Dr. Jones.\n\nSince Dr. Smith must be scheduled after Dr. Jones, we want to subtract the number of schedules where Dr. Smith is scheduled before Dr. Jones from the total number of possible schedules. The number of schedules where Dr. Smith is scheduled after Dr. Jones is therefore 6! - 2 x 5!.\n\nWe can simplify this expression by calculating the values: \n6! = 720\n5! = 120\n2 x 5! = 240\n6! - 2 x 5! = 720 - 240 = 480.\n\nSo, the number of ways to schedule the 6 lecturers with the given restriction is 480. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{480}$."
