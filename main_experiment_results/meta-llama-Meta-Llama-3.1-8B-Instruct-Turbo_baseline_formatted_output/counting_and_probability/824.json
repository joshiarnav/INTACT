    "problem": "I have a drawer with 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives in it. If I reach in and randomly remove three pieces of silverware, what is the probability that I get one fork, one spoon, and one knife?",
    "solution": "First, we can find the denominator of our fraction.  There are a total of $\\dbinom{18}{3}=816$ ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware out of 18.  To find the numerator, we need to count the number of ways to choose one piece of each type of silverware.  There are 6 ways we could choose a fork, 6 ways to choose a spoon, and 6 ways to choose a knife, making a total of $6\\cdot 6 \\cdot 6=216$ ways to choose a fork, a knife, and a spoon so our final probability is $\\frac{216}{816}=\\boxed{\\frac{9}{34}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability of getting one fork, one spoon, and one knife, we can use the combination formula. There are a total of 18 pieces of silverware, so we choose 3 out of 18, which is $\\binom{18}{3} = 816$.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife. There are 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives, so the number of ways to choose one of each is $6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 = 216$.\n\nHowever, this counts the order in which we choose the silverware. Since we don't care about the order, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the 3 pieces of silverware, which is $3! = 6$. \n\nSo the number of ways to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife is $\\frac{216}{6} = 36$.\n\nThe probability is then $\\frac{36}{816} = \\frac{9}{204} = \\frac{3}{68} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{68}}$."
