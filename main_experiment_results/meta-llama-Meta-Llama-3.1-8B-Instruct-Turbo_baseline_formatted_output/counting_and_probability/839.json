    "problem": "Define a $\\it{good\\ word}$ as a sequence of letters that consists only of the letters $A$, $B$, and $C$ --- some of these letters may not appear in the sequence --- and in which $A$ is never immediately followed by $B$, $B$ is never immediately followed by $C$, and $C$ is never immediately followed by $A$. How many seven-letter good words are there?",
    "solution": "There are three choices for the first letter and two choices for each subsequent letter, so there are $3\\cdot2^{n-1}\\ n$-letter good words.  Substitute $n=7$ to find there are $3\\cdot2^6=\\boxed{192}$ seven-letter good words.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will use recursion and dynamic programming. \n\nLet's define $a_n, b_n, c_n$ as the number of $n$-letter good words that end with $A, B, C$ respectively. We have the following recursive relationships:\n\n- A good word ending with $A$ can be formed by appending $A$ to any good word ending with $B$ or $C$. So, $a_n = b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}$.\n- A good word ending with $B$ can be formed by appending $B$ to any good word ending with $A$ or $C$. So, $b_n = a_{n-1} + c_{n-1}$.\n- A good word ending with $C$ can be formed by appending $C$ to any good word ending with $A$ or $B$. So, $c_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}$.\n\nWe also have the base case: \n- The number of 1-letter good words is 3 because there are 3 one-letter words $A, B,$ and $C$. So, $a_1 = b_1 = c_1 = 1$.\n\nNow, we want to find the number of 7-letter good words. We can do this by recursively calculating $a_7, b_7, c_7$ using the above relationships.\n\nAfter going through the recursive calculation, we can find the number of 7-letter good words by summing $a_7, b_7, c_7$. The result is as follows:\n\n$a_1 = b_1 = c_1 = 1$\n$a_2 = b_1 + c_1 = 2$\n$b_2 = a_1 + c_1 = 2$\n$c_2 = a_1 + b_1 = 2$\n$a_3 = b_2 + c_2 = 4$\n$b_3 = a_2 + c_2 = 4$\n$c_3 = a_2 + b_2 = 4$\n$a_4 = b_3 + c_3 = 8$\n$b_4 = a_3 + c_3 = 8$\n$c_4 = a_3 + b_3 = 8$\n$a_5 = b_4 + c_4 = 16$\n$b_5 = a_4 + c_4 = 16$\n$c_5 = a_4 + b_4 = 16$\n$a_6 = b_5 + c_5 = 32$\n$b_6 = a_5 + c_5 = 32$\n$c_6 = a_5 + b_5 = 32$\n$a_7 = b_6 + c_6 = 64$\n$b_7 = a_6 + c_6 = 64$\n$c_7 = a_6 + b_6 = 64$\n\nTherefore, the number of 7-letter good words is $a_7 + b_7 + c_7 = 64 + 64 + 64 = 192$.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{192}$."
