    "problem": "A triangle with side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5 is inscribed in a circle of radius 3.  What is the area of the triangle? Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $3x$, $4x$, and $5x$.  The triangle is a right triangle, so its hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle.  Thus $5x=2\\cdot 3=6$, so $x=6/5$.  The area of the triangle is \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3x\\cdot 4x =\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{18}{5}\\cdot \\frac{24}{5}\n=\\frac{216}{25}=\\boxed{8.64}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "Since the triangle is in the ratio 3:4:5, we can let its side lengths be 3x, 4x, and 5x. \n\nThe hypotenuse of the right triangle (side length 5x) is the diameter of the circle, which is 2 times the radius of the circle. So 5x = 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nNow, we can solve for x: x = 6 / 5.\n\nNow, we can find the side lengths of the triangle: \n- The side lengths are 3 * (6/5), 4 * (6/5), and 6. The lengths are 18/5, 24/5, and 6.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle which is 1/2 * base * height. Since this is a 3-4-5 right triangle, we can let the base be 3x or 18/5, and the height be 4x or 24/5. \n\nThe area of the triangle is 1/2 * (18/5) * (24/5).\n\nArea = 1/2 * (18 * 24) / (5 * 5)\n      = (18 * 24) / (2 * 5 * 5)\n      = (432) / (50)\n      = 8.64\n\nSo the area of the triangle is $\\boxed{8.64}$"
