    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ has vertices at $A(5,8)$, $B(3,-2)$, and $C(6,1)$. The point $D$ with coordinates $(m,n)$ is chosen inside the triangle so that the three small triangles $ABD$, $ACD$ and $BCD$ all have equal areas. What is the value of $10m + n$?",
    "solution": "If $D$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, then $ABD$, $ACD$, and $BCD$ would all have equal areas (to see this, remember that the medians of a triangle divide the triangle into 6 equal areas). There is only one point with this property (if we move around $D$, the area of one of the small triangles will increase and will no longer be $1/3$ of the total area). So $D$ must be the centroid of triangle $ABC$. The $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the centroid are found by averaging the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively, of the vertices, so $(m,n) = \\left( \\frac{5+3+6}{3}, \\frac{8+(-2)+1}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{14}{3}, \\frac{7}{3} \\right)$, and $10m + n = 10 \\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right) + \\frac{7}{3} = \\boxed{49}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the point $D$ where the three small triangles $ABD$, $ACD$, and $BCD$ have equal areas, we need to find the centroid of triangle $ABC$. The centroid is the point where the medians of the triangle intersect, and it divides each median into two segments, one of which is twice the length of the other, with the longer segment being on the side closer to the vertex.\n\nThe centroid of a triangle with vertices $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3)$ can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$(x_c, y_c) = \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3}{3}\\right)$$\n\nUsing the given coordinates of the vertices of triangle $ABC$, we can plug them into the formula to calculate the centroid $D$:\n\n$$(x_c, y_c) = \\left(\\frac{5 + 3 + 6}{3}, \\frac{8 - 2 + 1}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{14}{3}, \\frac{7}{3}\\right)$$\n\nSince the point $D$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, its coordinates are $(\\frac{14}{3}, \\frac{7}{3})$. Therefore, the value of $10m + n$ can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$10m + n = 10\\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{7}{3}\\right) = \\frac{140}{3} + \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{147}{3} = 49$$\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{49}$"
