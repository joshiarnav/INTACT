The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, so we can find the angle at $P$ by subtracting the other two angles from $180^\\circ$. \n\n$\\angle PRQ = 180^\\circ - \\angle PQR - \\angle QPR$\n$\\angle PRQ = 180^\\circ - 63^\\circ - 59^\\circ$\n$\\angle PRQ = 58^\\circ$\n\nNow, we need to find $\\angle QRC$. Since $C$ is the incenter of triangle $PQR$, $C$ is the center of the inscribed circle. The inscribed circle touches all three sides of the triangle at three points. Let's call these points $A$, $B$, and $D$. The angle bisectors of the triangle intersect at $C$. Let's call the points where the inscribed circle touches the sides of the triangle as $A$, $B$, and $D$. Let $D$ be the point on $PR$ where the inscribed circle touches the side $PR$. \n\nSince $\\angle PRQ = 58^\\circ$, $\\angle PQR = 63^\\circ$, and $\\angle QPR = 59^\\circ$, we can find $\\angle QRP$ using the angle sum of triangle $QRP$ which is also $180^\\circ$.\n\n$\\angle QRP = 180^\\circ - \\angle QPR - \\angle PRQ$\n$\\angle QRP = 180^\\circ - 59^\\circ - 58^\\circ$\n$\\angle QRP = 63^\\circ$\n\nSince $D$ is the point on $PR$ where the inscribed circle touches the side $PR$, we can see that $\\angle QRD$ is half of the angle $\\angle QRP$. This is because the angle bisector of the angle at $Q$ intersects the circle at the point where the circle touches the side of the triangle, and the angle bisector is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at that point.\n\n$\\angle QRD = \\frac{1}{2} \\angle QRP$\n$\\angle QRD = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 63^\\circ$\n$\\angle QRD = 31.5^\\circ$\n\nSince $\\angle QRD = 31.5^\\circ$ and the triangle is isosceles, $\\angle QRC$ is also $31.5^\\circ$.\n\n$\\boxed{31.5}$."
