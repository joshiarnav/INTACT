    "problem": "A square and a circle intersect so that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle. What is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "Drawing a diagram and adding $OM$ perpendicular to $AD$, we get\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-1,1);\nB=(1,1);\nC=(1,-1);\nD=(-1,-1);\nE=(-1,-.577);\nF=(-1,.577);\nM=(-1,0);\ndraw(circle(O,1.155));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--A);\ndraw(F--O);\ndraw(O--E);\ndraw(O--M);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"F\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, dir(0));\nlabel(\"M\", M, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (F+O)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (E+O)/2, SE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", M, W);\n[/asy] First note that $O$ is not only the center of the circle but also the center of the square since the diagram is symmetric. Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the ratio of the areas of the square and the circle, we need to find the side length of the square and the radius of the circle.\n\nLet $r$ be the radius of the circle. \n\nDraw a radius from the center of the circle to a point where it intersects a side of the square. Then draw a line from this intersection point perpendicular to the side of the square. This line has length $r/2$.\n\nThe angle formed by this line and the radius is a right angle and is equal to $45^\\circ$ because the lengths of the two sides that form this angle are equal. Therefore, this is a 45-45-90 triangle.\n\nAs such, the length of the line we drew from the intersection point to the corner of the square is also $r/2$. This line is half the diagonal of the square. \n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the diagonal of the square is $\\sqrt{(r/2)^2 + (r/2)^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot (r/2) = r/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe side length of the square is therefore $r/\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{2} = r/\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{2} = r\\sqrt{2}/2$.\n\nNow we can calculate the areas of the circle and the square. \n\nThe area of the circle is $A_{circle} = \\pi r^2$.\n\nThe area of the square is $A_{square} = (r\\sqrt{2}/2)^2 = (r^2/2) \\cdot 2 = r^2$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is:\n\n$$\\frac{A_{square}}{A_{circle}} = \\frac{r^2}{\\pi r^2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\pi}}$$"
