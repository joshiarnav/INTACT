    "problem": "Jimmy owns a cube-shaped container that measures $10$ inches on each side. He fills this container with water until it is half full. Then he throws ten giant ice cubes that measure $2$ inches on each side into the container. In inches cubed, how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water?",
    "solution": "First let's compute the volume of the container. The container measures $10\\times10\\times10$ so its volume is  $$10\\cdot10\\cdot10=10^3=1000$$inches cubed. Since the container is only half full, there are $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10^3=500$$inches cubed of water in it. Additionally, there are ten ice cubes each with a volume of $2^3$. This means that the total volume of the ice cubes is $$10\\cdot2^3=10\\cdot8=80.$$Altogether, the water and the ice cubes occupy $500+80=580$ inches cubed. This means that there are $1000-580=\\boxed{420}$ inches cubed of space in the container unoccupied by water and ice.",

    "model_solution": "To find out how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water, we first need to calculate the total volume of the container and the volumes of water and ice.\n\nThe container is a cube with a side length of $10$ inches. The volume of a cube is given by:\n\nVolume = side length^3\n= 10^3\n= 1000 cubic inches\n\nSince the container is half full of water, the volume of water is:\n\nVolume of water = (1/2) * 1000\n= 500 cubic inches\n\nEach ice cube is a cube with a side length of $2$ inches. The volume of a cube is given by:\n\nVolume of a single ice cube = side length^3\n= 2^3\n= 8 cubic inches\n\nThere are ten giant ice cubes, so the total volume of ice is:\n\nTotal volume of ice = 10 * 8\n= 80 cubic inches\n\nTo find the unoccupied volume, we subtract the volumes of water and ice from the total volume of the container:\n\nUnoccupied volume = Total volume of the container - volume of water - total volume of ice\n= 1000 - 500 - 80\n= 420 cubic inches\n\nSo, the unoccupied volume of the container is $\\boxed{420}$."
