    "model_solution": "To find the total surface area of the rectangular box, we need to first find the dimensions of the box.\n\nLet's denote the length, width, and height of the box as $l$, $w$, and $h$, respectively. \n\nWe are given that the sum of the lengths of the twelve edges of the box is $140$, which can be expressed as $4(l + w + h) = 140$. \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get $l + w + h = 35$.\n\nWe are also given that the distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner is $21$, which can be expressed as $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = 21$. \n\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get $l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = 441$.\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with three variables. \n\nUsing the identity $(l + w + h)^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2 + 2lw + 2lh + 2wh$, we can rewrite the first equation as $1225 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2 + 2lw + 2lh + 2wh$. \n\nSubstituting the value of $l^2 + w^2 + h^2$ from the second equation, we get $1225 = 441 + 2lw + 2lh + 2wh$. \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get $2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 784$. \n\nDividing both sides of the equation by $2$, we get $lw + lh + wh = 392$.\n\nThe total surface area of the box can be expressed as $2(lw + lh + wh)$.\n\nSubstituting the value of $lw + lh + wh$ from the above equation, we get $2(392) = 784$.\n\nHowever, $2(lw + lh + wh)$ is the surface area of the 6 sides of the rectangular box, not the total surface area.\n\nTo get the total surface area, we need to add the areas of the other 6 sides. This would be $2lh + 2wh + 2lw$. \n\nWe already know that $2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 784$, so to get the total surface area, we need to divide the total area of all sides by 3 and then multiply by 2.\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the box is $2(392/3) * 3 = \\boxed{784}$."
