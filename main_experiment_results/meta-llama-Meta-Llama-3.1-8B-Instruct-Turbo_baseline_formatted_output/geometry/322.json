    "problem": "The radius of a cylinder is doubled and its height is tripled. If its original volume was 10 cubic feet, what is its volume now, in cubic feet?",
    "solution": "Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively.  The new cylinder has volume \\[\n\\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\\pi r^2 h,\n\\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume.  Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.",

    "model_solution": "The original volume of the cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nV = \u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nwhere V is the volume, \u03c0 is a constant, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nThe volume is given as 10 cubic feet, so we can write:\n\n10 = \u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nNow, let's consider the changes made to the cylinder. The radius is doubled and the height is tripled, so the new volume is given by:\n\nV' = \u03c0(2r)\u00b2(3h)\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nV' = \u03c0(4r\u00b2)(3h)\n\nV' = 12\u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nSubstituting the original volume expression, we get:\n\nV' = 12(10)\n\nV' = 120\n\nSo, the volume of the cylinder is now 120 cubic feet.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{120}$."
