    "problem": "The square with vertices $(-a, -a), (a, -a), (-a, a), (a, a)$ is cut by the line $y = x/2$ into congruent quadrilaterals.  The perimeter of one of these congruent quadrilaterals divided by $a$ equals what?  Express your answer in simplified radical form.",
    "solution": "The line $y=\\frac x2$ will intersect the two vertical sides of the square, as shown below:\n[asy]\nreal f(real x)\n{\n\nreturn x/2;\n}\n\nimport graph;\nsize(6cm);\nreal a = 8;\npair A=(-a,a), B=(a,a), C=(a,-a), D=(-a,-a);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\ndraw(graph(f,-11,11),Arrows);\naxes(Arrows(4));\ndot(\"$(-a,a)$\",A,N);\ndot(\"$(a,a)$\",B,N);\ndot(\"$(a,-a)$\",C,S);\ndot(\"$(-a,-a)$\",D,S);\nreal eps=0.2;\ndot((8,4)^^(-8,-4));\ndraw(shift((10,0))*\"$2a$\",(-a+eps,-a/2-.5)--(a-eps,-a/2-.5),Arrows);\ndraw(shift((0,10))*\"$a$\",(a+2*eps,-a/2)--(a+2*eps,a/2),Arrows);[/asy]\nThe equation of the right side of the square is $x=a,$ so we have $y= \\frac x2 = \\frac a2,$ which means that the intersection point with the right side of the square is $\\left(a, \\frac a2 \\right).$ Similarly, the equation of the left side of the square is $x=-a,$ so we have $y= \\frac x2 = -\\frac a2,$ which means that the intersection point with the left side of the square is $\\left(-a, -\\frac a2 \\right).$ It follows that the sides of each quadrilateral have lengths $\\frac a2,$ $2a,$ $\\frac{3a}2,$ and $\\sqrt{a^2 + (2a)^2} = a\\sqrt{5},$ by the Pythagorean theorem. Hence, the perimeter of the quadrilateral is \\[\\frac a2 + 2a + \\frac{3a}2 + a\\sqrt{5} = \\left(4+\\sqrt5\\right)a,\\]and when this is divided by $a,$ we get $\\boxed{4+\\sqrt{5}}.$",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the points where the line $y = x/2$ intersects the sides of the square. \n\nThe line intersects the right side of the square at $(a, a/2)$, which can be found by setting $y = a/2$ in the equation of the line.\n\nThe line intersects the left side of the square at $(-a, -a/2)$, which can be found by setting $y = -a/2$ in the equation of the line.\n\nWe need to find the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral. The vertical sides have length $a$ and the two horizontal sides have length $a/2$ and $a/2$. However, the bottom side of the quadrilateral is not a straight line, but a segment of the line $y = x/2$. To find the length of this side, we need to find the $x$-coordinate of the point where the line intersects the bottom side of the square. \n\nThe line intersects the bottom side of the square at $(x, -a)$, which can be found by setting $y = -a$ in the equation of the line. Solving for $x$ gives us $x = -2a$. \n\nHowever, we are interested in the distance between the point $(-a, a)$ and the point where the line intersects the bottom side of the square, which is $(-2a, -a)$. The length of this side can be found using the distance formula, which is $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. This gives us $\\sqrt{(-2a - (-a))^2 + (-a - a)^2} = \\sqrt{(-a)^2 + 4a^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 + 4a^2} = \\sqrt{5a^2} = a\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nThe perimeter of the quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of its sides, which is $a + a/2 + a/2 + a\\sqrt{5}$. Simplifying this expression gives us $a + a + a\\sqrt{5} = 2a + a\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nThe problem asks us to divide the perimeter of the quadrilateral by $a$. This gives us $(2a + a\\sqrt{5})/a = 2 + \\sqrt{5}$. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{2 + \\sqrt{5}}$."
