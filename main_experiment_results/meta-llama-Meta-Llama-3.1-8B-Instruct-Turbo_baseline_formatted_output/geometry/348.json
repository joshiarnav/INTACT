The base has side $10$, so the diagonal will satisfy: $$d^2=10^2+10^2=200$$ $$d=10\\sqrt{2}$$ Half of this is $5\\sqrt{2}$.  Now we can look at the right triangle formed by the altitude from the vertex of the pyramid, the line just drawn in, and with hypotenuse as the edge we need to find the length of.  The length of this edge is: $$\\sqrt{12^2+(5\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{144+50}=\\sqrt{194}\\approx 13.928$$ The total length of all edges is: $$4(10)+4(13.928)\\approx \\boxed{ 96}$$",

    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the lengths of the pyramid's eight edges, we need to find the length of the four base edges and the four slant edges, then add them together.\n\nThe base edges are the sides of the square base. Since the base is a square with a side length of 10 cm, the sum of the lengths of the four base edges is $4 \\times 10 = 40$ cm.\n\nTo find the length of the slant edges, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. If we draw a diagonal from the center of the base to the opposite corner of the base, it will bisect the base and create two right-angled triangles. Let's call the point where the diagonal intersects the base point E, and the center of the base point D. \n\nThe length of the diagonal is the hypotenuse of a 45-45-90 triangle with legs of length 5 cm (half of the base side length). Since it is a 45-45-90 triangle, its hypotenuse has a length of $5\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, DE is $5\\sqrt{2}$ cm long. \n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the slant edge. Let's call the point where the slant edge intersects the base point C, the center of the base point D, and the peak of the pyramid point A. We know that the distance from A to D is 12 cm, and the distance from D to C is $5\\sqrt{2}$ cm. \n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of AC:\n\nAC$^2$ = AD$^2$ + DC$^2$\n\nAC$^2$ = 12$^2$ + ($5\\sqrt{2}$)$^2$\n\nAC$^2$ = 144 + 50\n\nAC$^2$ = 194\n\nAC = $\\sqrt{194}$\n\nAC $\\approx$ 13.928\n\nNow, we need to multiply this value by 4 since there are four slant edges and add it to the sum of the lengths of the base edges. \n\nThe sum of the lengths of the eight edges is approximately $40 + 4 \\times 13.928 = 40 + 55.712 = 95.712 \\approx \\boxed{96}$."
