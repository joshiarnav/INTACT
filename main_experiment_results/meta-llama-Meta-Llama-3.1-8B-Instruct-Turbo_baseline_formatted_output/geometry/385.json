    "problem": "What is the volume in cubic inches of a right, rectangular prism with side, front and bottom faces having an area 15 square inches, 10 square inches and 6 square inches, respectively?",
    "solution": "Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of the rectangular prism, we need to find the length, width, and height. Since the side, front, and bottom faces have areas of 15, 10, and 6 square inches, respectively, we can let the dimensions be length (l), width (w), and height (h).\n\nWe are given the following equations:\n- lw = 6\n- lh = 10\n- wh = 15\n\nSince we are trying to solve for volume, we need to find l, w, and h. Multiplying these three equations together, we get (lw)(lh)(wh) = 6 * 10 * 15.\n\nThis simplifies to l^2w^2h^2 = 900. Taking the square root of both sides, we get lwh = 30.\n\nThis is the volume of the rectangular prism in cubic inches.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{30}$."
