    "solution": "Since $AB$ and $BC$ are positive integers and $AB < BC$, $BC - AB$ must be at least 1.\n\nThe triangle with side lengths $AB = 650$, $BC = 651$, and $AC = 706$ satisfies the given conditions, and for this triangle $BC - AB = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$, we should first understand the properties of a triangle. The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nLet's denote the lengths of the sides as follows: $AB = x$, $BC = x + y$, and $AC = x + z$. Given that the perimeter is 2007 units, we have: $x + (x + y) + (x + z) = 2007$.\n\nSince $x < x + y \\leq x + z$, we can simplify the inequality to: $3x + y + z \\leq 2007$ and $x + 2y + z \\geq 2007$.\n\nSince we want the smallest possible value of $BC - AB = y$, we should minimize $y$ while satisfying the triangle inequality. \n\nNow, we have the following inequalities: \n1) $x + y > z$\n2) $x + z > y$\n3) $x + y + z > x$\n\nThe third inequality is automatically satisfied. We can eliminate the first two inequalities by combining them.\n\nSince $x + z > x + y - z$, we can replace $z$ with $x + y - z$, so we get $x + (x + y - z) > x + y - z$ and we can eliminate this inequality. Now we have:\n$2x > 0$\n\nAnd also $x + y + z < 3x + y + z$ and $3x + y + z < 2007$, so we can write: $y + z < 2x + y + z$ and $3x + y + z < 2007$, so $x + y + z < 2007$, and $x + 2y + z > 2007$ from the start.\n\nWe know from the perimeter equation that $x + y + z = 2007 - x$. So we have: $2007 - x + y + z > 2007$.\n\nAnd we can get: $x + 2y + z > 2007$ and $2007 - 2x > y + z$.\n\nSince $3x + y + z < 2007$, we have $y + z < 2007 - 3x$ and $x + 2y + z > 2007$, so we can write: $x + 2y + z - (y + z) > 2007 - (2007 - 3x)$.\n\nThe equation is: $x + y > 3x - 2007 + 2007$.\n\nSo we have: $x + y > 0$, $3x + y + z < 2007$, and $x + 2y + z > 2007$.\n\nSince we want $y$ to be the smallest possible value, we can minimize $y$ by making $z$ as large as possible.\n\nWe can write: $3x + y + z < 2007$ and $x + 2y + z > 2007$, so $z > (x + 2y + z - 3x - y - z)/1$.\n\nWe have: $z > (x + y + z - 2x - y)/1$.\n\nWe can simplify the inequality to: $z > (2007 - 2x)/1$.\n\nAnd we can simplify the inequality to: $z > 2007 - 2x$.\n\nSince $z > 2007 - 2x$ and $z + y > x$, we can write: $z + 2007 - 2x > x$.\n\nSo we have: $2007 - x > x$.\n\nThe inequality is: $2007 > 2x$.\n\nAnd we can simplify the inequality to: $1003.5 > x$.\n\nSo the maximum value of $x$ is 1003.\n\nSince we want the smallest possible value of $y = BC - AB$, we should minimize $y$ while satisfying the triangle inequality.\n\nSince $3x + y + z < 2007$ and $x + 2y + z > 2007$, we can write: $3x + y + (2007 - 2x) < 2007$.\n\nWe can simplify the inequality to: $x + y < 2007 - 2007$.\n\nAnd we can simplify the inequality to: $x + y < 0$.\n\nThe inequality is not possible for $x < 1003$ and $x > 0$. \n\nNow we want to minimize $y$ while $x + 2y + z > 2007$ and $z > 2007 - 2x$.\n\nWe can simplify the inequality to: $x + 2y + 2007 - 2x > 2007$.\n\nAnd we can simplify the inequality to: $2y > 0$.\n\nWe can simplify the inequality to: $y > 0$.\n\nIf $x = 668$ and $y = 1$, then we have the smallest possible value of $y$.\n\nThe solution is $\\boxed{1}.$"
