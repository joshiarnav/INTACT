    "solution": "$\\angle CDF = \\angle AEB$ and $\\angle BAE = \\angle CFD$, so we know that $\\bigtriangleup AEB \\sim \\bigtriangleup FDC$.  Thus, denoting the side length of $BEFC$ as $x$, we can create the ratios: $\\frac{28}{x} = \\frac{x}{58} \\Rightarrow x^2 = 1624$, and since $x^2$ is the area of square $BCFE$, $\\boxed{1624}$ is the answer.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the inscribed square $BCFE$, we first need to understand the relationship between the triangle $AGD$ and the square. \n\nSince the square is inscribed in the right triangle and is at a 45-degree angle, we can see that the square is tangent to the sides of the triangle at the points where the square intersects the sides. \n\nThis means that the sides of the square are parallel to the two legs of the right triangle, making the square's sides the average of the two legs of the triangle. \n\nFrom the diagram, let's denote the side length of the square as $x$. Then, we can use the fact that the square's sides are the average of the two legs of the triangle.\n\nDenoting $AB$ as $a$, $CD$ as $b$, and the square's side length as $x$, we have\n\n$$x\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a+b}{2}$$\n\nSince we have $AB = 28$ units and $CD = 58$ units, we can substitute these values into the equation to solve for the side length of the square.\n\n$$x\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{28+58}{2}$$\n\nSimplifying the equation gives\n\n$$x\\sqrt{2} = 43$$\n\nDividing both sides by $\\sqrt{2}$ gives\n\n$$x = \\frac{43}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{2}$\n\n$$x = \\frac{43\\sqrt{2}}{2}$$\n\nFinally, the area of the square $BCFE$ is the square of its side length, so we have\n\n$$Area = x^2 = \\left(\\frac{43\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2$$\n\nSimplifying the expression gives the final answer.\n\n$$Area = \\left(\\frac{43\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{43^2 \\times 2}{4} = \\frac{1849 \\times 2}{4} = \\frac{3698}{4} = 924.5$$\n\nRounding the answer to the nearest whole number is not the request, therefore\n\n$\\boxed{1849/4}$ is not in the correct format and the answer needs to be in a box with the number in the box.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{369.75}$"
