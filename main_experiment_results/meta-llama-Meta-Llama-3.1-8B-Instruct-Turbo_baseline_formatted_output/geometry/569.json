    "model_solution": "To find the cosine of angle AMB in a regular tetrahedron, we can use vector operations.\n\nFirst, let's label the vertices of the tetrahedron as A, B, C, and D. Let's also denote the midpoint of CD as M.\n\nThe vectors from A to B, C, and D are denoted as AB, AC, and AD, respectively. We can also denote the vector from A to M as AM.\n\nSince the tetrahedron is regular, we know that AB, AC, and AD are all congruent. Let's denote their length as s.\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find the cosine of angle AMB. However, we can use the fact that the tetrahedron is regular to simplify our work.\n\nSince the tetrahedron is regular, we can use the following relationship:\n\nAD^2 = (AB^2 + AC^2)/2\n\nSince AD, AB, and AC are all congruent, we can substitute s for each of these values:\n\ns^2 = (s^2 + s^2)/2\n\ns^2 = s^2/2\n\ns^2 = 0.5s^2\n\nSince s^2 = 0.5s^2, we can simplify this expression by dividing both sides by s^2:\n\n1 = 0.5\n\n1/0.5 = 1/0.5\n\n2 = 1\n\nThe above isn't in the right form to be easily solved. So, we instead look at the relationship between the midpoint of CD and the other vertices of the tetrahedron. Since M is the midpoint of CD, we can see that the triangle AMB is an equilateral triangle.\n\nThe cosine of angle AMB in an equilateral triangle is -1/3 or  -0.3333."
