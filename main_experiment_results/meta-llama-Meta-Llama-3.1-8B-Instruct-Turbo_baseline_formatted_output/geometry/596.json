    "problem": "Point $P$ is inside equilateral $\\triangle ABC$.  Points $Q$, $R$, and $S$ are the feet of the perpendiculars from $P$ to $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{CA}$, respectively. Given that $PQ=1$, $PR=2$, and $PS=3$, what is $AB$ in terms of radicals?",
    "solution": "Let the side length of $\\triangle ABC$ be $s$. Then the areas of $\\triangle APB$, $\\triangle BPC$, and $\\triangle CPA$ are, respectively, $s/2$, $s$, and $3s/2$.  The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is the sum of these, which is $3s$.  The area of $\\triangle ABC$ may also be expressed as $(\\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$, so $3s = (\\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$. The unique positive solution for $s$ is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the length of AB, we can use the fact that the area of an equilateral triangle can be expressed in two ways. \n\nFirst, consider the area as being made up of three congruent triangles, each with base AB and height 1/2 * h, where h is the altitude of the equilateral triangle. Then the area is given by:\n\n[Area] = (1/2) * AB * (1/2) * h * 3 = (3/4) * AB * h\n\nNext, let's consider the area as being made up of the smaller triangles, each with base AB and height equal to the distance from the base to point P. This gives us:\n\n[Area] = (1/2) * AB * 1 + (1/2) * AB * 2 + (1/2) * AB * 3 = (6) * (1/2) * AB\n\nSince the two expressions for the area are equal, we have:\n\n(3/4) * AB * h = (6) * (1/2) * AB\n\nSolving for AB, we get:\n\nAB = 8 / (3/2) = 16 / 3 * (2/3)\n\nHowever, the altitude h of an equilateral triangle can be found using the formula h = sqrt(3) * AB / 2. Then the area can also be expressed as (sqrt(3) / 4) * AB^2.\n\nUsing the same two expressions for the area as before, we have:\n\n(sqrt(3) / 4) * AB^2 = (3/4) * AB * sqrt(3) * AB / 2\n\nSimplifying the equation we get:\n\n(sqrt(3) / 4) * AB^2 = (3 * sqrt(3)) / 8 * AB^2\n\nDividing both sides by AB^2, we get:\n\n(sqrt(3) / 4) = (3 * sqrt(3)) / 8\n\nAB^2 = 8 / sqrt(3)\n\nAB = sqrt(8 / sqrt(3))\n\nAB = 2 sqrt(2) sqrt(sqrt(3))\n\nAB = 2 sqrt(2) * 3^(1/4)\n\nSo the length of AB is 2 * sqrt(2) * 3^(1/4) which in radical form is sqrt(12 * sqrt(3))."
