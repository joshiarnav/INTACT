By the Two Tangent Theorem, $AP = AQ = 23$, $BP = BR = 27$, and $CQ = CR = x$. Using $rs = A$, where $s = \\frac{27 \\cdot 2 + 23 \\cdot 2 + x \\cdot 2}{2} = 50 + x$, we get $(21)(50 + x) = A$. By Heron's formula, $A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{(50+x)(x)(23)(27)}$. Equating and squaring both sides,\n\\begin{eqnarray*}  [21(50+x)]^2 &=& (50+x)(x)(621)\\\\ 441(50+x) &=& 621x\\\\ 180x = 441 \\cdot 50 &\\Longrightarrow & x = \\frac{245}{2}   \\end{eqnarray*}\nWe want the perimeter, which is $2s = 2\\left(50 + \\frac{245}{2}\\right) = \\boxed{345}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll use the fact that the radius of the inscribed circle is perpendicular to the sides of the triangle.\n\nWe know that $AP=23$ and $PB=27$, and the radius of the inscribed circle is $21$. Let's denote the point of tangency as $P$.\n\nSince the radius of the inscribed circle is $21$, $AP=23$, and $PB=27$, we can use the fact that $AP+PB=AB$ to find $AB$.\n\nHowever, since $AP$ and $PB$ are not the lengths of the segments connected by the side of the triangle and the point of tangency, we need to find the total length of the segment $AB$.\n\nSince the inscribed circle's radius is $21$, and it is tangent to the line $AB$ at $P$, then we have $AP+21=AB$, and $PB-21=AB$.\nSince $AP+PB=AB$, we have that $(AP+21)+(PB-21)=AB$.\nWe can simplify this to $AP+PB=AB$, which is $23+27=AB$.\nSo $AB=50$.\n\nSince we only need to find the perimeter of the triangle, let's denote the other two sides as $AC$ and $BC$. Let's denote the radius of the inscribed circle as $r$.\n\nSince $r$ is the radius of the inscribed circle, $r=21$.\n\nWe also know that the tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the point of tangency.\n\nThe point of tangency is $P$, and the side of the triangle is $AB$.\n\nSo we have a right triangle $APB$, and since the sides are $AP=23$, $PB=27$, we can find the length of the hypotenuse $AB$ using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nBut we already know that $AB=50$, so we can skip this step.\n\nSince the radius of the inscribed circle is $21$, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle.\n\nHowever, since we are only interested in the perimeter of the triangle, we can use the fact that the perimeter of a triangle is equal to the sum of its sides.\n\nSo we need to find the lengths of the other two sides $AC$ and $BC$.\n\nSince the inscribed circle's radius is $21$, we can use the fact that the radius of the inscribed circle is perpendicular to the sides of the triangle.\n\nSo we have a right triangle $APC$, and since the sides are $AP=23$, $r=21$, we can find the length of the hypotenuse $AC$ using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that for a right triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and hypotenuse $c$, we have $a^2+b^2=c^2$.\n\nSo we can write $AP^2+r^2=AC^2$.\n\nWe can simplify this to $23^2+21^2=AC^2$.\n\nWe can simplify this to $529+441=AC^2$.\n\nWe can simplify this to $970=AC^2$.\n\nSo we can write $AC=\\sqrt{970}$.\n\nSimilarly, we can write $BP^2+r^2=BC^2$.\n\nSo we can write $27^2+21^2=BC^2$.\n\nWe can simplify this to $729+441=BC^2$.\n\nWe can simplify this to $1170=BC^2$.\n\nSo we can write $BC=\\sqrt{1170}$.\n\nHowever, since we only need to find the perimeter of the triangle, we can use the fact that the perimeter of a triangle is equal to the sum of its sides.\n\nSo we can write $P_{ABC}=AB+AC+BC$.\n\nWe can substitute the values we found to get $P_{ABC}=50+\\sqrt{970}+\\sqrt{1170}$.\n\nHowever, since we want the answer to be in the format $\\boxed{answer}$, we need to find the numerical value of the expression.\n\nWe can use the fact that $\\sqrt{970}=\\sqrt{7\\cdot 140}=2\\sqrt{35\\cdot 5\\sqrt7}$ and $\\sqrt{1170}=\\sqrt{9\\cdot 130}=\\sqrt{9\\cdot 10\\cdot 13}=3\\sqrt{130}$."
