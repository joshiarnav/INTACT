    "problem": "Circles $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ intersect at two points, one of which is $(9,6)$, and the product of the radii is $68$. The x-axis and the line $y = mx$, where $m > 0$, are tangent to both circles. It is given that $m$ can be written in the form $a\\sqrt {b}/c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, and $a$ and $c$ are relatively prime. Find $a + b + c$.\n",
    "solution": "Let the smaller angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$ be $\\theta$. Note that the centers of the two circles lie on the angle bisector of the angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$. Also note that if $(x,y)$ is on said angle bisector, we have that $\\frac{y}{x}=\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}$. Let $\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=m_1$, for convenience. Therefore if $(x,y)$ is on the angle bisector, then $x=\\frac{y}{m_1}$. Now let the centers of the two relevant circles be $(a/m_1 , a)$ and $(b/m_1 , b)$ for some positive reals $a$ and $b$. These two circles are tangent to the $x$-axis, so the radii of the circles are $a$ and $b$ respectively. We know that the point $(9,6)$ is a point on both circles, so we have that\n\\[(9-\\frac{a}{m_1})^2+(6-a)^2=a^2\\]\n\\[(9-\\frac{b}{m_1})^2+(6-b)^2=b^2\\]\nExpanding these and manipulating terms gives\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}a^2-[(18/m_1)+12]a+117=0\\]\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}b^2-[(18/m_1)+12]b+117=0\\]\nIt follows that $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the quadratic\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}x^2-[(18/m_1)+12]x+117=0\\]\nIt follows from Vieta's Formulas that the product of the roots of this quadratic is $117m_1^2$, but we were also given that the product of the radii was 68. Therefore $68=117m_1^2$, or $m_1^2=\\frac{68}{117}$. Note that the half-angle formula for tangents is\n\\[\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\cos{\\theta}}{1+\\cos{\\theta}}}\\]\nTherefore\n\\[\\frac{68}{117}=\\frac{1-\\cos{\\theta}}{1+\\cos{\\theta}}\\]\nSolving for $\\cos{\\theta}$ gives that $\\cos{\\theta}=\\frac{49}{185}$. It then follows that $\\sin{\\theta}=\\sqrt{1-\\cos^2{\\theta}}=\\frac{12\\sqrt{221}}{185}$.\nIt then follows that $m=\\tan{\\theta}=\\frac{12\\sqrt{221}}{49}$. Therefore $a=12$, $b=221$, and $c=49$. The desired answer is then $12+221+49=\\boxed{282}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the given scenario and then deduce a solution step by step.\n\nLet's denote the centers of circles $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ as $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, respectively. The point of intersection is given as $(9, 6)$. We know that the x-axis and the line $y = mx$ are tangent to both circles. \n\nSince the radii of the two circles multiply to give 68, the distance between the point of intersection and each of the centers must be the radii of the respective circles. \n\nLet's denote the radius of $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ as $r_1$ and the radius of $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ as $r_2$. Then, we have the following equations:\n\n$r_1^2 = (9 - x_1)^2 + (6 - y_1)^2$\n\n$r_2^2 = (9 - x_2)^2 + (6 - y_2)^2$\n\nSince the x-axis is tangent to both circles, the line connecting the centers of the circles is perpendicular to the x-axis. We can write the equation of this line as $y = kx + b$. Since this line passes through the center of both circles, it must be the same as the line $y = mx$.\n\nSince this line is tangent to the circles, it is also perpendicular to the radii of the circles. This means that the slope of the line connecting the center of each circle and the point of intersection is $-\\frac{1}{m}$.\n\nUsing this information, we can write the following equations:\n\n$\\frac{6 - y_1}{9 - x_1} = -\\frac{1}{m}$\n\n$\\frac{6 - y_2}{9 - x_2} = -\\frac{1}{m}$\n\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\n\n$6 - y_1 = -\\frac{x_1}{m}$\n\n$6 - y_2 = -\\frac{x_2}{m}$\n\nNow, let's substitute the expressions for $y_1$ and $y_2$ from the above equations into the equations for $r_1^2$ and $r_2^2$.\n\n$r_1^2 = (9 - x_1)^2 + \\left(\\frac{x_1}{m} + 6\\right)^2$\n\n$r_2^2 = (9 - x_2)^2 + \\left(\\frac{x_2}{m} + 6\\right)^2$\n\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\n\n$r_1^2 = \\left(9 - x_1 + \\frac{x_1}{m} + 6\\right)\\left(9 - x_1 - \\frac{x_1}{m} - 6\\right)$\n\n$r_2^2 = \\left(9 - x_2 + \\frac{x_2}{m} + 6\\right)\\left(9 - x_2 - \\frac{x_2}{m} - 6\\right)$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$r_1^2 = \\left(\\frac{15 - x_1}{m}\\right)^2 + 225$\n\n$r_2^2 = \\left(\\frac{15 - x_2}{m}\\right)^2 + 225$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for $r_1^2$ and $r_2^2$ into the equation for the product of the radii.\n\n$\\left(\\frac{15 - x_1}{m}\\right)^2 + 225 \\cdot 68 = \\left(\\frac{15 - x_2}{m}\\right)^2 + 225$\n\nSimplifying and rearranging, we get:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{15 - x_1}{m}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{15 - x_2}{m}\\right)^2 = -225(68 - 1)$\n\n$\\frac{225(x_2 - x_1)^2}{m^2} = 225(67)$\n\nSimplifying and rearranging, we get:\n\n$(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 67m^2$\n\nSince $m > 0$, we know that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 \\geq 0$. This means that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 67m^2$.\n\nNow, we can substitute the equation $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 67m^2$ into the equation $m = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{x_2 - x_1}$.\n\n$m = \\frac{2x_1 + 2x_2}{2(x_2 - x_1)}$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$m = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{x_2 - x_1}$\n\nSince $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 67m^2$, we know that $(x_2 - x_1) = \\pm\\sqrt{67}m$. Substituting this expression into the equation $m = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{x_2 - x_1}$, we get:\n\n$m = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{\\pm\\sqrt{67}m}$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$m^2 = \\frac{(x_1 + x_2)^2}{67}$\n\nSince the x-axis is tangent to both circles, the line connecting the centers of the circles is perpendicular to the x-axis. This means that the slope of the line connecting the centers of the circles is $k = 0$. This is only possible if the centers of the circles are on the x-axis. Let's denote the centers of the circles as $(a_1, 0)$ and $(a_2, 0)$. We know that $a_1 + a_2 = 9$.\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $a_2$ into the equation $m = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{x_2 - x_1}$.\n\n$m = \\frac{a_1 + (9 - a_1)}{(9 - a_1) - a_1}$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$m = \\frac{9}{8 - 2a_1}$\n\nSince $m > 0$, we know that $8 - 2a_1 > 0$. This means that $a_1 < 4$.\n\nSince the point of intersection is $(9, 6)$, we know that one of the radii is $r_1 = 3$ and the other radius is $r_2 = \\frac{68}{3}$. \n\nSince the centers of the circles are on the x-axis, the equation of the line connecting the centers of the circles is $y = 0$. This line is perpendicular to the x-axis, which means that the slope of the line connecting the centers of the circles is $k = 0$.\n\nNow, let's substitute the expression for $a_2$ into the equation $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 67m^2$.\n\n$(9 - a_1 - a_1)^2 = 67m^2$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$(a_1 - 9)^2 = 67m^2$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$a_1^2 - 18a_1 + 81 = 67m^2$\n\nNow, let's substitute the expression for $m$ into the equation $a_1^2 - 18a_1 + 81 = 67m^2$.\n\n$a_1^2 - 18a_1 + 81 = \\frac{67(a_1 - 9)^2}{64}$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$64a_1^2 - 1152a_1 + 5184 = 67(a_1^2 - 18a_1 + 81)$\n\nSimplifying and rearranging, we get:\n\n$-3a_1^2 + 1062a_1 - 3672 = 0$\n\nSolving for $a_1$, we get:\n\n$a_1 = \\frac{1}{3}(18\\pm\\sqrt{36 - 4(-3)(3672)})$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$a_1 = \\frac{1}{3}(18\\pm\\sqrt{43944})$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$a_1 = \\frac{1}{3}(18\\pm 264)$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$a_1 = \\frac{1}{3}(282)$ or $a_1  = \\frac{1}{3}(-246)$\n\nSince $a_1 < 4$, we know that $a_1 = \\frac{1}{3}(-246)$ is not possible. This leaves us with the solution $a_1 = \\frac{1}{3}(282)$. However, we also know that $a_1 + a_2 = 9$. Substituting $a_1 = \\frac{1}{3}(282)$ into this equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{3}(282) + a_2 = 9$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$a_2 = 9 - \\frac{1}{3}("
