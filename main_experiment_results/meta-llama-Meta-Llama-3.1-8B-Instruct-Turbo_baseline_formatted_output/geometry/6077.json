    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with $AC = 7,$ $BC = 24,$ and right angle at $C.$ Point $M$ is the midpoint of $AB,$ and $D$ is on the same side of line $AB$ as $C$ so that $AD = BD = 15.$ Given that the area of triangle $CDM$ may be expressed as $\\frac {m\\sqrt {n}}{p},$ where $m,$ $n,$ and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, find $m + n + p.$\n",
    "solution": "We use the Pythagorean Theorem on $ABC$ to determine that $AB=25.$\nLet $N$ be the orthogonal projection from $C$ to $AB.$ Thus, $[CDM]=\\frac{(DM)(MN)} {2}$, $MN=AM-AN$, and $[ABC]=\\frac{24 \\cdot 7} {2} =\\frac{25 \\cdot (CN)} {2}.$\nFrom the third equation, we get $CN=\\frac{168} {25}.$\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem in $\\Delta ACN,$ we have\n$AN=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{24 \\cdot 25} {25}\\right)^2-\\left(\\frac{24 \\cdot 7} {25}\\right)^2}=\\frac{24} {25}\\sqrt{25^2-7^2}=\\frac{576} {25}.$\nThus, $MN=\\frac{576} {25}-\\frac{25} {2}=\\frac{527} {50}.$\nIn $\\Delta ADM$, we use the Pythagorean Theorem to get $DM=\\sqrt{15^2-\\left(\\frac{25} {2}\\right)^2}=\\frac{5} {2} \\sqrt{11}.$\nThus, $[CDM]=\\frac{527 \\cdot 5\\sqrt{11}} {50 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2}= \\frac{527\\sqrt{11}} {40}.$\nHence, the answer is $527+11+40=\\boxed{578}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of triangle $CDM$, we can utilize the concept of similar triangles and the area formula for triangles. \n\nFirst, we need to find the length of $AB$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find $AB$ as follows:\n\\[AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 = 7^2 + 24^2 = 625.\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\\[AB = 25.\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the length of $CM$ and $MD$. To do this, we can use the fact that $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$ and that $AD = BD = 15$. Since $D$ is on the same side of line $AB$ as $C$, we can form the following right triangle by drawing the altitude from $C$ to $AB$, with the foot of the altitude being $E$:\n\\[\\begin{array}{c}\n  \\text{Triangle }AEB \\text{ is isosceles with } AB = 25 \\text{ and } AE = BE \\text{.}\\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\n\nThis means that the base of triangle $AEB$ is $25$ and the altitude is the height of triangle $AEB$, which is also the height of triangle $CAB$. The hypotenuse of triangle $AEB$ is $AE + BE = 2 \\cdot AE$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find $AE$ as follows:\n\\[AE^2 + BE^2 = AB^2 = 25^2 = 625.\\]\nSince $AE = BE$, we can rewrite this as:\n\\[AE^2 + AE^2 = 625.\\]\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\\[2 \\cdot AE^2 = 625.\\]\nDividing both sides of this equation by $2$, we get:\n\\[AE^2 = \\frac{625}{2}.\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\\[AE = \\frac{25}{\\sqrt{2}}.\\]\n\nWe can now find the height of triangle $CAB$ (which is the altitude from $C$ to $AB$) by finding $CE$:\n\\[CE = AE - BE = \\frac{25}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{25}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{25}{2 \\sqrt{2}}.\\]\n\nWe can simplify this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{2}$:\n\\[CE = \\frac{25\\sqrt{2}}{2\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{25\\sqrt{2}}{4}.\\]\n\nWe can now find the area of triangle $CAB$ using the formula $\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base of the triangle and $h$ is the height of the triangle:\n\\[Area(CAB) = \\frac{1}{2}(AC)(CE) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 7 \\cdot \\frac{25\\sqrt{2}}{4} = \\frac{175\\sqrt{2}}{8}.\\]\n\nWe can now find the area of triangle $ABM$ by finding the area of triangle $ABC$ and subtracting the area of triangle $ACB$:\n\\[Area(ABM) = Area(ABC) - Area(ACB) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 24 \\cdot \\frac{25}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{175\\sqrt{2}}{8}.\\]\n\nTo subtract these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is $8$. To do this, we multiply the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by $\\frac{8}{8}$:\n\\[Area(ABM) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 24 \\cdot \\frac{25}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{8}{8} - \\frac{175\\sqrt{2}}{8}.\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\\[Area(ABM) = \\frac{1200\\sqrt{2}}{8} - \\frac{175\\sqrt{2}}{8} = \\frac{1025\\sqrt{2}}{8}.\\]\n\nWe can now find the area of triangle $CDM$ by finding the area of triangle $ABM$ and subtracting the area of triangle $ACD$:\n\\[Area(CDM) = Area(ABM) - Area(ACD).\\]\n\nWe can find the area of triangle $ACD$ by finding the area of triangle $ACB$ and subtracting the area of triangle $ADC$, which is equal to $0$. So, the area of triangle $ACD$ is equal to the area of triangle $ACB$. Since triangle $ACB$ is a right triangle with legs $7$ and $24$, we can find its area using the formula $\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base of the triangle and $h$ is the height of the triangle:\n\\[Area(ACB) = \\frac{1}{2}(AC)(BC) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 7 \\cdot 24 = 84.\\]\n\nWe can now find the area of triangle $CDM$:\n\\[Area(CDM) = Area(ABM) - Area(ACD) = \\frac{1025\\sqrt{2}}{8} - 84.\\]\n\nTo subtract these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is $8$. To do this, we multiply the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by $\\frac{8}{8}$:\n\\[Area(CDM) = \\frac{1025\\sqrt{2}}{8} - 84 \\cdot \\frac{8}{8} = \\frac{1025\\sqrt{2}}{8} - \\frac{672}{8}.\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\\[Area(CDM) = \\frac{1025\\sqrt{2} - 672}{8}.\\]\n\nWe can now find the value of $1025\\sqrt{2}$ by multiplying $1025$ by $\\sqrt{2}$:\n\\[1025\\sqrt{2} = 1025 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 1025\\sqrt{2}.\\]\n\nWe can now find the value of $1025\\sqrt{2} - 672$ by subtracting $672$ from $1025\\sqrt{2}$:\n\\[1025\\sqrt{2} - 672 = 1025\\sqrt{2} - 672 = 353\\sqrt{2}.\\]\n\nWe can now rewrite the area of triangle $CDM$ as:\n\\[Area(CDM) = \\frac{353\\sqrt{2}}{8}.\\]\n\nSince $353$, $2$, and $8$ are relatively prime, we can conclude that the values of $m$, $n$, and $p$ are $353$, $2$, and $8$, respectively. \n\nTherefore, the sum of $m$, $n$, and $p$ is:\n\\[m + n + p = 353 + 2 + 8 = \\boxed{363}.\\]"
