    "problem": "Square $ABCD$ has sides of length 2. Set $S$ is the set of all line segments that have length 2 and whose endpoints are on adjacent sides of the square. The midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ enclose a region whose area to the nearest hundredth is $k$. Find $100k$.\n",
    "solution": "Without loss of generality, let $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, $(0,2)$, and $(2,2)$ be the vertices of the square. Suppose the endpoints of the segment lie on the two sides of the square determined by the vertex $(0,0)$. Let the two endpoints of the segment have coordinates $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$. Because the segment has length 2, $x^2+y^2=4$. Using the midpoint formula, we find that the midpoint of the segment has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Let $d$ be the distance from $(0,0)$ to $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Using the distance formula we see that $d=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2}= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}\\left(x^2+y^2\\right)}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}(4)}=1$. Thus the midpoints lying on the sides determined by vertex $(0,0)$ form a quarter-circle with radius 1.\n[asy] size(100); pointpen=black;pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); pair A=(0,0),B=(2,0),C=(2,2),D=(0,2); D(A--B--C--D--A);  picture p; draw(p,CR(A,1));draw(p,CR(B,1));draw(p,CR(C,1));draw(p,CR(D,1)); clip(p,A--B--C--D--cycle); add(p); [/asy]\nThe set of all midpoints forms a quarter circle at each corner of the square. The area enclosed by all of the midpoints is $4-4\\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=4-\\pi \\approx .86$ to the nearest hundredth. Thus $100\\cdot k=\\boxed{86}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area enclosed by the midpoints of the line segments in set $S$, we first need to determine the shape that these midpoints form.\n\nWhen we consider the midpoints of the line segments in set $S$, we notice that they form a quarter circle at each corner of the square. The radius of each quarter circle is 1, as the line segments have a length of 2 and the endpoints are on adjacent sides of the square.\n\nThe area enclosed by the midpoints is equal to the area of the square minus the areas of the four quarter circles.\n\nThe area of the square is $2^2=4$.\n\nThe area of each quarter circle is $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\pi \\cdot 1^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n\nSince there are four quarter circles, the total area enclosed by the midpoints is $4-4 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4}=4-\\pi$.\n\nFinally, we need to round this value to the nearest hundredth, which is $4-\\pi \\approx 0.86$ when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nTherefore, $100k = 100 \\cdot (4-\\pi) \\approx 86$. \n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{86}$."
