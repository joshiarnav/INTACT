    "problem": "A right circular cone has base radius $r$ and height $h$. The cone lies on its side on a flat table. As the cone rolls on the surface of the table without slipping, the point where the cone's base meets the table traces a circular arc centered at the point where the vertex touches the table. The cone first returns to its original position on the table after making $17$ complete rotations. The value of $h/r$ can be written in the form $m\\sqrt {n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n$.\n",
    "solution": "The path is a circle with radius equal to the slant height of the cone, which is $\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}}$. Thus, the length of the path is $2\\pi\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}}$.\nAlso, the length of the path is 17 times the circumference of the base, which is $34r\\pi$. Setting these equal gives $\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}} = 17r$, or $h^{2} = 288r^{2}$. Thus, $\\dfrac{h^{2}}{r^{2}} = 288$, and $\\dfrac{h}{r} = 12\\sqrt {2}$, giving an answer of $12 + 2 = \\boxed{14}$.",

    "model_solution": "The path that the cone's base traces as it rolls is a circle with a radius equal to the slant height of the cone, which we can find using the Pythagorean Theorem:\n\nThe slant height is $\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$.\n\nThe circumference of this path is $2 \\pi \\cdot \\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$.\n\nSince the cone makes 17 complete rotations, the circumference of this path is also equal to $17 \\cdot 2 \\pi r$.\n\nSetting the two equal, we get the equation: \n$2 \\pi \\cdot \\sqrt{r^2 + h^2} = 17 \\cdot 2 \\pi r$\n\nDividing both sides by $2 \\pi$ and then squaring both sides, we get:\n\n$\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2} = 17 \\cdot r$\n\nSquaring both sides again, we get:\n\n$r^2 + h^2 = 289r^2$\n\nSubtracting $r^2$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$h^2 = 288r^2$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$h = 12\\sqrt{2}r$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio $h/r$ by dividing both sides by $r$:\n\n$h/r = 12\\sqrt{2}$\n\nFinally, we can find the sum $m + n$ by adding the coefficients of the square root and the number under the square root:\n\n$m + n = 12 + 2 = 14$.\n\nSo, our answer is $\\boxed{14}$."
