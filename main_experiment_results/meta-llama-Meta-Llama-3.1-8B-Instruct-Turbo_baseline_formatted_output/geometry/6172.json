    "model_solution": "To find the area of $\\triangle ABC$, we first need to find the lengths of its sides. Given that the circle's radius is $2$, the diameter $AB$ has a length of $4$. \n\nThe distance from point $A$ to point $D$ is the sum of the lengths of $AB$ and $BD$, i.e., $4+3=7$. This means that the distance from $A$ to $E$, i.e., $AE$, can be found using Pythagoras' theorem as $\\sqrt{ED^2+AD^2}=\\sqrt{5^2+7^2}=\\sqrt{74}$.\n\nTo find the length of segment $AC$, we can use the Power of a Point theorem. Given that point $A$ lies on a circle with radius $2$, $A$ is the center of the circle and $AE$ is a tangent. The Power of a Point theorem can now be used to calculate the length of $AC$ as $AC = \\frac{AE^2}{AD}$. Substituting the given values, we get $AC = \\frac{74}{7}$.\n\nThe length of $BC$ can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. This means that we first need to find the length of segment $AE$, which is given as $\\sqrt{74}$. We also need to find the length of $EC$. $EC$ can be found by applying the Pythagorean theorem to get $\\sqrt{5^2+AE^2}=\\sqrt{74+25}=\\sqrt{99}$. Therefore, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ can now be calculated as $\\frac{BC \\cdot AC}{2}$.\n\nTo find the length of $BC$, we use the Pythagorean theorem as the length of segment $AC$ is known, i.e., $BC = \\sqrt{AC^2 - 2^2}$ which equals to $BC = \\sqrt{(\\frac{74}{7})^2-4}$. Now, we can use this value to calculate the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nThe area of $\\triangle ABC = \\frac{BC \\cdot AC}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\frac{74}{7})^2-4} \\cdot \\frac{74}{7}}{2}$. This can be written as $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{74}{7} \\cdot \\sqrt{(\\frac{74}{7})^2-4} = \\frac{74}{14} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{5476}{49}-4}$\n\nExpanding the expression under the square root, we have $\\frac{74}{14} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{5476}{49}-\\frac{196}{49}} = \\frac{74}{14} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{5280}{49}} = \\frac{37}{7} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{5280}{49}}$\n\nTo simplify this further, we can remove the square root by squaring the expression $\\frac{37}{7} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{5280}{49}}$. This gives us $\\frac{37^2}{7^2} \\cdot \\frac{5280}{49} = \\frac{1369 \\cdot 5280}{2401 \\cdot 49}$\n\nWe can simplify this expression further as $\\frac{36 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 280}{7^2 \\cdot 49} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 280}{7 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 49} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 40}{7 \\cdot 49}$\n\nNow we can simplify the expression further by canceling out common factors in the numerator and the denominator. We get $\\frac{12 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 5}{7 \\cdot 7} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 95}{7^2} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 19}{7^2} = \\frac{60 \\cdot 19}{7^2} = \\frac{60 \\cdot 19}{49}$\n\nThis can be simplified further by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 1.
