    "problem": "Two points $A(x_1, y_1)$ and $B(x_2, y_2)$ are chosen on the graph of $f(x) = \\ln x$, with $0 < x_1 < x_2$. The points $C$ and $D$ trisect $\\overline{AB}$, with $AC < CB$. Through $C$ a horizontal line is drawn to cut the curve at $E(x_3, y_3)$. Find $x_3$ if $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 1000$.\n",
    "solution": "Since $C$ is the trisector of line segment $\\overline{AB}$ closer to $A$, the $y$-coordinate of $C$ is equal to two thirds the $y$-coordinate of $A$ plus one third the $y$-coordinate of $B$. Thus, point $C$ has coordinates $(x_0, \\frac{2}{3} \\ln 1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\ln 1000) = (x_0, \\ln 10)$ for some $x_0$. Then the horizontal line through $C$ has equation $y = \\ln 10$, and this intersects the curve $y = \\ln x$ at the point $(10, \\ln 10)$, so $x_3 = \\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the coordinates of point C, which trisects the line segment AB. We can use the section formula to find the coordinates of C.\n\nThe section formula states that if a point P(x, y) divides the line segment joining the points A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2) in the ratio m:n, then the coordinates of P are given by:\n\n((mx2 + nx1)/(m+n), (my2 + ny1)/(m+n))\n\nIn this case, point C trisects the line segment AB, so the ratio is 1:2. Therefore, the coordinates of C are:\n\n((2*1 + 1*1)/(1+2), (2*ln 1 + 1*ln 1000)/(1+2)) \n = (3/3, (ln 1000 + ln 1)/3)\n= (1, ln 1000/3)\n\nSince point C has the same y-coordinate as point A (ln 1 = 0) we can ignore that part and simply look at the x-coordinate of point C which is (1)\n\nTo find the x-coordinate of point E, we need to find the y-coordinate of point C, which we already did. Since point E lies on the curve y = ln x, we can write:\n\ny = ln x\nln 1000/3 = ln x\n\nWe can now solve for x:\n\nln x = ln 1000/3\nx = e^(ln 1000/3)\n\nSince e^ln a = a we can simplify the equation:\n\nx = 1000^(1/3)\nx = \u221b1000\nx = \u221b(10^3)\nx = 10\n\nTherefore, the value of x3 is:\n\nx3 = 10"
