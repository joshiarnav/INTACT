    "problem": "Amy and Belinda each roll a sheet of 6-inch by 8-inch paper to form a cylindrical tube. Amy tapes the two 8-inch sides together without overlap. Belinda tapes the two 6-inch sides together without overlap. What is $\\pi$ times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes?",
    "solution": "Amy's cylinder has a height of 8 and a base circumference of 6.  Let her cylinder have volume $V_A$ and radius $r_A$; we have $2\\pi r_A = 6$ so $r_A = 3/\\pi$ and $V_A = \\pi r_A ^2 h = \\pi (3/\\pi)^2 (8) = 72/\\pi$.\n\nBelinda's cylinder has a height of 6 and a base circumference of 8.  Similarly, let her cylinder have volume $V_B$ and radius $r_B$; we have $2\\pi r_B = 8$ so $r_B = 4/\\pi$ and $V_B = \\pi r_B^2 h = \\pi (4/\\pi)^2 (6) = 96/\\pi$.\n\nThe positive difference between the volume of the two tubes is $96/\\pi - 72/\\pi = 24/\\pi$ cubic inches; $\\pi$ times this difference is $\\boxed{24}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volumes of the tubes, we first need to find the radius and height of each tube. \n\nFor Amy's tube, the height (h) is 8 inches and the circumference (C) is 6 inches. The circumference of a circle is given by C = 2\u03c0r, where r is the radius. We can use this formula to find the radius of Amy's tube:\n\n6 = 2\u03c0r\nr = 6 / (2\u03c0)\nr = 3 / \u03c0\n\nThe formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r^2h. We can use this formula to find the volume of Amy's tube:\n\nV_Amy = \u03c0(3/\u03c0)^2(8)\nV_Amy = \u03c0(9/\u03c0^2)(8)\nV_Amy = (72/\u03c0)\n\nFor Belinda's tube, the height (h) is 6 inches and the circumference (C) is 8 inches. We can use the circumference formula to find the radius of Belinda's tube:\n\n8 = 2\u03c0r\nr = 8 / (2\u03c0)\nr = 4 / \u03c0\n\nThe volume of Belinda's tube is:\n\nV_Belinda = \u03c0(4/\u03c0)^2(6)\nV_Belinda = \u03c0(16/\u03c0^2)(6)\nV_Belinda = (96/\u03c0)\n\nThe positive difference between the volumes of the two tubes is:\n\nV_diff = |V_Amy - V_Belinda|\n= |(72/\u03c0) - (96/\u03c0)|\n= |(-24/\u03c0)|\n= (24/\u03c0)\n\nThe problem asks for \u03c0 times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes:\n\n\u03c0 \u00d7 V_diff = \u03c0 \u00d7 (24/\u03c0)\n= 24\n\nSo the final answer is $\\boxed{24}$."
