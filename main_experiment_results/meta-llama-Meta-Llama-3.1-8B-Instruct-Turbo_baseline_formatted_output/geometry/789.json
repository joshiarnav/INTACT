    "solution": "Let $BC = s$. We can see that $AD$ consists of the altitudes from $A$ and $D$ to $BC$, each of which has length $s\\sqrt{3}/2$. Thus, $AD = s\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, $AD\\div BC = s\\sqrt{3}/s = \\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $AD \\div BC$, let's denote $BC$ as $s$ since both $ABC$ and $BCD$ are equilateral triangles.\n\nSince the height of an equilateral triangle can be calculated by multiplying the side length $s$ by $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, the height of triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times s$. \n\nThe height of triangle $ABC$ will be equal to the length of $BD$ (or $BC$), which in this case is the same as $AD$ (height of the larger equilateral triangle). So, $AD = BD = 2 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times s = \\sqrt{3}s$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $AD \\div BC$ is $\\frac{AD}{BC} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}s}{s} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}$."
