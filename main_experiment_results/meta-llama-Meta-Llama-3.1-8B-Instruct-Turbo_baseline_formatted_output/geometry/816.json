    "problem": "A square sheet of paper has area $6 \\text{ cm}^2$. The front is white and the back is black. When the sheet is folded so that point $A$ rests on the diagonal as shown, the visible black area is equal to the visible white area. How many centimeters is $A$ from its original position? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the length of a leg of the black isosceles triangle.  Then the black area is $\\frac{1}{2}(x)(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x^2$.  The white area is $6-x^2$.  Solving $\\frac{1}{2}x^2=6-x^2$, we find $x^2=4$, so $x=2$.  The distance from A to its original position is the length of a hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs have length $x$.  Therefore, A is $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$ centimeters from its original position.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the diagonal when the paper is folded. Let's denote this length as $x$.\n\nThe visible black area is the area of the two triangles that are formed when the paper is folded. Each of these triangles has a base of $\\frac{x}{2}$ and a height of $\\frac{x}{2}$. The area of each triangle is therefore $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{x}{2} \\times \\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{x^2}{8}$.\n\nThe visible white area is the area of the square minus the area of the two triangles. This is $6 - 2 \\times \\frac{x^2}{8} = 6 - \\frac{x^2}{4}$.\n\nSince the visible black area is equal to the visible white area, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{x^2}{8} = 6 - \\frac{x^2}{4}$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{x^2}{8} = \\frac{24 - x^2}{4}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $8$ to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n\n$$x^2 = 48 - 2x^2$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$3x^2 = 48$$\n\nDividing both sides by $3$, we get:\n\n$$x^2 = 16$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$$x = \\sqrt{16} = 4$$\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal is $4$ cm. However, we are asked to find the distance from point $A$ to its original position. This distance is equal to the length of the diagonal because the paper is folded along the diagonal.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{4\\sqrt{2}}$"
