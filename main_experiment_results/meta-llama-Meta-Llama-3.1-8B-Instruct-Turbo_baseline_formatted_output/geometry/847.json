    "model_solution": "To find the range of possible values for $x$, we must consider the triangle inequality. This states that for any triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, the following inequalities must hold: \n\n$a + b > c$, $a + c > b$, and $b + c > a$. \n\nIn this case, we have $a = 6$, $b = 5$, and $c = x$. We need to consider the inequalities $6 + 5 > x$, $6 + x > 5$, and $5 + x > 6$. \n\nThe inequality $6 + 5 > x$ gives us $11 > x$, which can be written as $x < 11$. \n\nThe inequality $6 + x > 5$ gives us $x > -1$. \n\nThe inequality $5 + x > 6$ gives us $x > 1$. \n\nSince $x$ must be an integer, the least possible integral value of $x$ is 2, and the greatest possible integral value of $x$ is 10. \n\nTherefore, the positive difference between the greatest and least possible integral values of $x$ is $10 - 2 = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
