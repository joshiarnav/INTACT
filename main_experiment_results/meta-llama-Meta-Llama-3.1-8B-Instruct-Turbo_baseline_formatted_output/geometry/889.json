    "solution": "Because the figure has rotational symmetry, $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$. Consequently, the triangles $BZQ$ and $BWQ$ have the same area because they share a height and have bases that are the same length. We have\n\n$$[BQW]=\\dfrac{1}{2}[BZW]=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\left([ABWZ]-[ABZ]\\right)$$$$=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\left(120-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\cdot6\\cdot12\\right)=\\dfrac{1}{2}(120-36)=\\dfrac{84}{2}=\\boxed{42}.$$",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of triangle $BQW$, we first need to find the length of $QD$.\nSince $ABCD$ is a rectangle and $AB=12$ units, we have $AD=DC=BC=14$ units. Given that $AZ=WC=6$ units, we can determine the length of $BD$ by adding $AB$ to $AD$.\n\nSince the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is 120 square units, we can calculate the length of $QD$ as follows:\nThe area of a trapezoid is $\\frac{a+b}{2}h$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the parallel sides and $h$ is the height between the parallel sides. In this case, the parallel sides are $ZW$ and $CD$, and the height is $AZ$. Therefore, we can write an equation for the area of the trapezoid as:\n$\\frac{ZW+CD}{2}AZ=120$\n$\\frac{ZW+14}{2}(6)=120$\n$\\frac{ZW+14}{2}=10$\n$ZW+14=20$\n$ZW=6$\nNow we know that $ZW=6$, so the length of $QD$ is $6$ units as well.\n\nTherefore, we can find the area of triangle $BQW$ by using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the length of the base and $h$ is the height. In this case, the base is $QB=BD=14$ units and the height is $QW=ZW=6$ units.\nArea of triangle $BQW$ = $\\frac{1}{2}bh$\n= $\\frac{1}{2}(14)(6)$\n= $42$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{42}$"
