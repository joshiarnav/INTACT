    "problem": "A round pizza is $\\frac13$ of an inch thick and has a diameter of 12 inches. It is cut into 12 congruent pieces. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one piece? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "The entire pizza has radius 6 inches and volume $\\pi (6^2)(1/3) = 12\\pi$ cubic inches.  One slice has 1/12th this volume, or $\\boxed{\\pi}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of one piece, we first need to find the volume of the entire pizza. The pizza is a cylinder, and the formula for the volume of a cylinder is $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height (or thickness) of the cylinder.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the pizza is 12 inches, the radius is half of that, which is 6 inches. The thickness of the pizza is $\\frac13$ of an inch.\n\nThe volume of the entire pizza is $V = \\pi (6)^2 (\\frac13) = \\pi (36)(\\frac13) = 12\\pi$ cubic inches.\n\nSince the pizza is cut into 12 congruent pieces, the volume of one piece is $\\frac{12\\pi}{12} = \\boxed{\\pi}$ cubic inches."
