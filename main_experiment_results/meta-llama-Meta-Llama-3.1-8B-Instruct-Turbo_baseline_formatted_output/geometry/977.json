    "problem": "The corner of a unit cube is chopped off such that the cut runs through the three vertices adjacent to the vertex of the chosen corner.  What is the height of the remaining cube when the freshly-cut face is placed on a table?",
    "solution": "The major diagonal has a length of $\\sqrt{3}$.  The volume of the pyramid is $1/6$, and so its height $h$ satisfies $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot h\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(\\sqrt{2})^2=1/6$ since  the freshly cut face is an equilateral triangle of side length $\\sqrt{2}$.  Thus $h=\\sqrt{3}/3$, and the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry involved. \n\nImagine a unit cube with a corner chopped off. The cut runs through three vertices adjacent to the chosen corner. Let's call the chosen corner A, and the adjacent vertices B, C, and D. \n\nAfter chopping off the corner, we are left with a triangular face on the table. This triangular face is a right-angled triangle, with one side being the diagonal of the original cube's face (since the cut runs through the three adjacent vertices), and the other two sides being the edges of the original cube's face.\n\nThe diagonal of the original cube's face is $\\sqrt{2}$ (since all the edges of the cube are of unit length, and the diagonal forms an isosceles right triangle).\n\nNow, let's consider the height of the remaining cube. The height is the distance from the center of the triangular face to the opposite corner of the cube. This is also the height of the triangular pyramid formed by the chopped-off corner.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height. Let's call the height 'h', and the distance from the center of the triangular face to the midpoint of the diagonal of the triangular face 'x'. Then, using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n$h^2 + x^2 = 1^2$\n\nWe also know that the distance from the center of the triangular face to the midpoint of the diagonal of the triangular face is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ (since the diagonal of the triangular face is $\\sqrt{2}$, and the center of the triangular face is the midpoint of the diagonal).\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of x into the above equation:\n\n$h^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2 = 1^2$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$h^2 + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$\n\n$h^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$h = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}$"
