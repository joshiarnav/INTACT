    "solution": "At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{2}{3}(360^\\circ)=240$ degrees.  Every minute, the minute hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}(360^\\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12} (360^\\circ)=0.5$ degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.  After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\\circ-5.5^\\circ\\cdot 15=\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the positions of the hour and minute hands at 8:15.\n\nThe minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which is a 6-degree movement per minute. Since it is 15 minutes past the hour, the minute hand is at 15 * 6 = 90 degrees.\n\nThe hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which is a 30-degree movement per hour. Additionally, it moves 360/12/60 = 0.5 degrees per minute. Therefore, at 8:15, the hour hand is at 8 * 30 + 15 * 0.5 = 240 + 7.5 = 247.5 degrees.\n\nNow, we need to find the smaller angle between the hour and minute hands. The larger angle is 247.5 - 90 = 157.5 degrees. However, we are asked to find the smaller angle. Therefore, the smaller angle is 360 - 157.5 = 202.5 degrees.\n\nSo, the number of degrees in the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock at 8:15 is 202.5 degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{202.5}$"
