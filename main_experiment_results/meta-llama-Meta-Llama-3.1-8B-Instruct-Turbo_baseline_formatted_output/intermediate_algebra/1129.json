    "model_solution": "To find the quotient, we can use polynomial long division. \n\nFirst, we write the dividend $8x^3+16x^2-7x+4$ and the divisor $2x+5$. We divide the leading term of the dividend ($8x^3$) by the leading term of the divisor ($2x$), which gives us $4x^2$. \n\nNow, we multiply the divisor ($2x+5$) by $4x^2$, which gives us $8x^3+20x^2$. We subtract this from the dividend $8x^3+16x^2-7x+4$ to get $-4x^2-7x+4$.\n\nNext, we divide the leading term of the result ($-4x^2$) by the leading term of the divisor ($2x$), which gives us $-2x$. \n\nWe multiply the divisor ($2x+5$) by $-2x$, which gives us $-4x^2-10x$. We subtract this from the result $-4x^2-7x+4$ to get $3x+4$.\n\nFinally, we divide the leading term of the result ($3x$) by the leading term of the divisor ($2x$), which gives us $\\frac{3}{2}$. \n\nWe multiply the divisor ($2x+5$) by $\\frac{3}{2}$, which gives us $3x+\\frac{15}{2}$. We subtract this from the result $3x+4$ to get $-\\frac{7}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the quotient is $4x^2-2x+\\frac{3}{2}$ with a remainder of $-\\frac{7}{2}$. However, the quotient we want is in the format of the divisor times the quotient plus the remainder, hence we write it as $-\\frac{7}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2x+5}$ we find an equivalent of this to $2x+5$, then we multiply by the quotient of $2x+5$ which gives us $4x^2-2x+\\frac{3}{2}$"
