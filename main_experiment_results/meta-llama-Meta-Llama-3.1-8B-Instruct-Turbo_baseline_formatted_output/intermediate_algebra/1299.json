    "model_solution": "To find $p(x)$, we consider the following steps:\n\n1.  Determine the degree of the polynomial: The degree of $p(x)$ is denoted by $d$. The degree of $[p(x)]^2$ is also $2d$ and the degree of $p(x^3)$ and $p(x^3-2)$ are $3d$ and $3d-2$, respectively. In order for the given equation to hold for all real numbers $x$, the degrees of the polynomial on the left-hand side and the right-hand side must be equal. Therefore, we have $2d=3d-2$, which implies that $d=2$. This means that the polynomial $p(x)$ is quadratic.\n2.  Express the polynomial as $p(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ and substitute into the given equation: We substitute $p(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ into the given equation and obtain\n\n\\begin{align*}\na(x^3)^2+b(x^3)+c-(ax^6+bx^3+c)-2(a(x^3-2)^2+b(x^3-2)+c) &= (ax^2+bx+c)^2+12\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a(x^9-x^6)-b(x^6-3x^3+2)+c(x^3-6) &= a^2x^4+2abx^3+(a^2+b^2+c^2)x^2\\\\\n&\\qquad+2abcx+(b^2+c^2)x^2+12\n\\end{align*}\n3.  Equate the coefficients on both sides of the equation: We can equate the coefficients on both sides of the equation by comparing the terms of the same degree on both sides.\n\nThe coefficients of $x^9$ on both sides are $a$, which implies that $a=0$.\n\nThe coefficients of $x^3$ on both sides are $-b-6c$ and $2ab+b^2+c^2$, respectively. Therefore, we have $-b-6c=2ab+b^2+c^2$, which implies that $2ab+b^2+c^2+b+6c=0$.\n\nThe constant terms on both sides are $c-12$ and $a^2+b^2+c^2+12$, respectively. Therefore, we have $c-12=a^2+b^2+c^2+12$, which implies that $a^2+b^2=24$.\n4.  Solve for the coefficients of the polynomial: We have $a=0$, $b^2+c^2=24$, and $2ab+b^2+c^2+b+6c=0$. The last equation can be simplified to $b^2+c^2+6c+b=0$.\n\nSubstituting $b^2+c^2=24$ into the last equation, we get $24+6c+b=0$, which implies that $b=-24-6c$.\n\nSubstituting $b=-24-6c$ into the equation $b^2+c^2=24$, we get $(-24-6c)^2+c^2=24$.\n\nExpanding the left-hand side of the equation, we get\n\n$$576+288c+36c^2+c^2=24$$\n\nwhich implies that $36c^2+288c+552=0$.\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by $4$, we get\n\n$$9c^2+72c+138=0.$$\n\nThe solutions to this equation are given by\n\n$$c=\\frac{-72\\pm \\sqrt{72^2-4\\cdot 9\\cdot 138}}{18}=\\frac{-72\\pm 24\\sqrt{26}}{18}=\\frac{-36\\pm 12\\sqrt{26}}{9}=\\frac{-12\\pm 4\\sqrt{26}}{3}$$\n\nSubstituting $c=\\frac{-12\\pm 4\\sqrt{26}}{3}$ into the equation $b=-24-6c$, we get\n\n$$b=\\frac{-36\\pm 24\\sqrt{26}}{3}$$\n\nThe polynomial $p(x)$ is given by\n\n\\begin{align*}\np(x)&=ax^2+bx+c\\\\\n&=0\\cdot x^2+\\left(\\frac{-36\\pm 24\\sqrt{26}}{3}\\right)x+\\left(\\frac{-12\\pm 4\\sqrt{26}}{3}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the polynomial $p(x)$ is given by\n\n$$p(x)=\\boxed{-4x^2-12x-4-4\\sqrt{26}}$$ or $$p(x)=\\boxed{-4x^2-12x-4+4\\sqrt{26}}$$"
