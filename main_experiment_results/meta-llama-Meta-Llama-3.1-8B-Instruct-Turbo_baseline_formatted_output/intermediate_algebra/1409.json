    "solution": "Let $y$ be a number in the range of $f.$ This means that there is a real number $x$ such that \\[y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}.\\]Multiplying both sides by $x^2-x+1$ and rearranging, we get the equation \\[yx^2-(y+1)x+y=0.\\]Since $x^2-x+1 = (x-\\tfrac12)^2 + \\tfrac34 > 0$ for all $x,$ our steps are reversible, so $y$ is in the range of $f$ if and only if this equation has a real solution for $x.$ In turn, this equation has a real solution for $x$ if and only if the discriminant of this quadratic is nonnegative. Therefore, the range of $f$ consists exactly of the values of $y$ which satisfy \\[(y+1)^2 - 4y^2 \\ge 0,\\]or \\[0 \\ge 3y^2 - 2y - 1.\\]This quadratic factors as \\[0 \\ge (3y+1)(y-1),\\]which means that the solutions to the inequality are given by $-\\tfrac13 \\le y \\le 1.$ Therefore, the range of $g$ is the closed interval $\\boxed{[-\\tfrac13, 1]}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the range of the function $f(x) = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}$, let's consider a real number $y$ in the range of $f$.\n\nSo, there exists a real number $x$ such that $y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}.$\n\nRearranging the equation, we have $yx^2-xy+y=x.$\n\nRewriting this as a quadratic equation in $x$, we get $yx^2-(y+1)x+y=0.$\n\nFor $y$ to be in the range of $f$, this quadratic equation must have a real solution for $x$.\n\nUsing the discriminant of the quadratic formula, we have $(y+1)^2-4y^2 \\ge 0.$\n\nSimplifying this, we get $3y^2-2y-1 \\le 0.$\n\nFactoring the quadratic expression, we get $(3y+1)(y-1) \\le 0.$\n\nSo, the solutions are $-\\tfrac13 \\le y \\le 1.$\n\nTherefore, the range of the function is $\\boxed{[-\\tfrac13, 1]}$."
