    "solution": "Apply the sum of cubes factorization to the expression $1000x^3+27 = (10x)^3+3^3$ to obtain  \\[\n1000x^3+27 = (10x+3)(100x^2-30x+9).\n\\]Thus $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+e^2+f^2=0^2+10^2+3^2+100^2+(-30)^2+9^2=\\boxed{11,\\!090}$. Note that the fundamental theorem of algebra implies that the factorization we have given is unique, since the discriminant $(-30)^2-4(100)(9)$ of the quadratic $100x^2-30x+9$ is negative.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can factor both sides of the equation. The left side can be factored as a sum of cubes: \n\n$1000x^3+27 = (10x)^3 + 3^3 = (10x+3)((10x)^2 - (10x)(3) + 3^2)$\n\nSimplifying this gives us:\n\n$(10x+3)(100x^2-30x+9)$\n\nComparing the two sides, we can conclude that $(a, b, c) = (10, 0, 3)$ and $(d, e, f) = (100, -30, 9)$.\n\nNow, we just need to sum the squares of these numbers:\n\n$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 + f^2 = 10^2 + 0^2 + 3^2 + 100^2 + (-30)^2 + 9^2$\n\nExpanding the squares gives:\n\n$= 100 + 0 + 9 + 10000 + 900 + 81$\n\n$= 11090$\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{11090}$."
