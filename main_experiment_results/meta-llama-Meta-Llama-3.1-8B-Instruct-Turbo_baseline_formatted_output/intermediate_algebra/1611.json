    "problem": "A sequence $a_1$, $a_2$, $\\ldots$ of non-negative integers is defined by the rule $a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n|$ for $n\\geq1$. If $a_1=999$, $a_2<999$, and $a_{2006}=1$, how many different values of $a_2$ are possible?",
    "solution": "The condition $a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n|$ implies that $a_n$ and $a_{n+3}$ have the same parity for all $n\\geq 1$. Because $a_{2006}$ is odd, $a_2$ is also odd.  Because $a_{2006}=1$ and $a_n$ is a multiple of $\\gcd(a_1,a_2)$ for all $n$, it follows that $1=\\gcd(a_1,a_2)=\\gcd(3^3\\cdot 37,a_2)$. There are 499 odd integers in the interval $[1,998]$, of which 166 are multiples of 3, 13 are multiples of 37, and 4 are multiples of $3\\cdot 37=111$. By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the number of possible values of $a_2$ cannot exceed $499-166-13+4=\\boxed{324}$.\n\nTo see that there are actually 324 possibilities, note that for $n\\geq 3$, $a_n<\\max(a_{n-2},a_{n-1})$ whenever $a_{n-2}$ and $a_{n-1}$ are both positive.  Thus $a_N=0$ for some $N\\leq 1999$. If $\\gcd(a_1,a_2)=1$, then $a_{N-2}=a_{N-1}=1$, and for $n>N$ the sequence cycles through the values 1, 1, 0.  If in addition $a_2$ is odd, then $a_{3k+2}$ is odd for $k\\geq 1$, so $a_{2006}=1$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the possible values of $a_2$, let's first look at how the sequence progresses. \n\nWe are given that $a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n|$. This sequence can be thought of as the absolute difference between consecutive terms. The difference between the absolute value and the original sequence is that it can increase, not decrease. \n\nWe can see the following sequence progression from $a_1$ to $a_2$ to $a_3$ to $a_4$ to $a_5$. \n\n- $a_3 = |a_2 - a_1|$\n- $a_4 = |a_3 - a_2|$\n- $a_5 = |a_4 - a_3|$\n\nBy plugging in the equation of $a_4$ into the equation of $a_5$, we get that $a_5 = |a_2 - a_3 - |a_3 - a_2||$.\n\nNotice that in the expression $|a_2 - a_3 - |a_3 - a_2||$, $-|a_3 - a_2|$ and $|a_2 - a_3|$ must be of the same parity because one of them is negative and the other is positive, but the absolute value of $-|a_3 - a_2|$ is equal to the absolute value of $|a_3 - a_2|$. This implies that the $-|a_3 - a_2|$ and $|a_2 - a_3|$ must cancel out to $0$, which means that $a_2 = a_3$.\n\nHowever, we cannot compute the value of $a_2$ from $a_3$ because there are multiple possible values for $a_3$, which lead to multiple possible values of $a_2$. But, we can compute the possible values of $a_2$ by analyzing the progression of $a_3$ to $a_4$.\n\nWe can see that $a_4 = |a_3 - a_2| = |a_2 - a_2| = |0| = 0$.\n\nHowever, we are given that $a_1=999$ and $a_{2006}=1$. \n\nThe sequence is a non-increasing sequence, so we can see that $a_3 > a_4 = 0$.\n\nNotice that when $a_2 = 998$, $a_3 = 1$. $a_4 = 0$, $a_5 = 1$, $a_6 = 0$, and $a_7 = 1$. However, the sequence then enters a cycle of $1, 0, 1, 0$.\n\nNotice that $a_2$ can range from $0$ to $999$.\n\nWe have to eliminate the possible values of $a_2$ so that the sequence does not enter a cycle of $1, 0, 1, 0$. \n\nWe have $a_1 = 999$ and $a_{2006} = 1$.\n\nLet $b_1 = a_1$ and $b_2 = a_2$. We can construct a new sequence $b_1, b_2, b_3, \\ldots$ such that $b_{n+2} = a_{n+2}$.\n\nNotice that $b_3 = a_3$.\n\nIf we construct the sequence $b_3, b_4, b_5, \\ldots$, we get that $b_4 = 0$.\n\nWe can see that the sequence $b_3, b_4, b_5, \\ldots$ will repeat if $b_3 = 1$.\n\nWe want to find all possible values of $b_2$ that make $b_3 > 1$. \n\nWe have $b_1 = 999$ and $b_3 = |b_2 - b_1| = |b_2 - 999|$.\n\nWe require $b_3 > 1$, so $b_3 \\geq 2$. \n\nThis means that $|b_2 - 999| \\geq 2$.\n\nWe can see that when $b_2 = 997$, $b_3 = 2$. \n\nWe can see that when $b_2 = 998$, $b_3 = 1$. \n\nHowever, we have $b_2 \\geq 997$ because $b_3 \\geq 2$. \n\nWe can see that the possible values of $b_2$ are $997, 998, 999$.\n\nHowever, we have $a_2 < 999$.\n\nThis means that we can eliminate $b_2 = 999$, which is equivalent to $a_2 = 999$.\n\nWe are left with $b_2 = 997, 998$.\n\nThis means that we have $a_2 = 997, 998$.\n\nHowever, we have to check if there are any other possible values of $a_2$.\n\nLet us consider the case when $a_2 = 0$.\n\nWe have $a_3 = |a_2 - a_1| = |0 - 999| = 999$.\n\nWe have $a_4 = 0$.\n\nWe have $a_5 = 999$.\n\nWe have $a_6 = 0$.\n\nWe have $a_7 = 999$.\n\nWe can see that the sequence $a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7$ will repeat.\n\nWe can see that the sequence $a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7$ is equivalent to the sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7$.\n\nThis means that we have $a_2 = 0$.\n\nHowever, we have $a_2 < 999$.\n\nThis means that we can eliminate $a_2 = 0$.\n\nWe are left with $a_2 = 997, 998$.\n\nHowever, we have to check if there are any other possible values of $a_2$.\n\nLet us consider the case when $a_2 = 1$.\n\nWe have $a_3 = |a_2 - a_1| = |1 - 999| = 998$.\n\nWe have $a_4 = 0$.\n\nWe have $a_5 = 998$.\n\nWe have $a_6 = 0$.\n\nWe have $a_7 = 998$.\n\nWe can see that the sequence $a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7$ will repeat.\n\nWe can see that the sequence $a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7$ is equivalent to the sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7$.\n\nThis means that we have $a_2 = 1$.\n\nHowever, we have $a_2 < 999$.\n\nThis means that we can eliminate $a_2 = 1$.\n\nWe are left with $a_2 = 997, 998$.\n\nHowever, we have to check if there are any other possible values of $a_2$.\n\nLet us consider the case when $a_2 = 2$.\n\nWe have $a_3 = |a_2 - a_1| = |2 - 999| = 997$.\n\nWe have $a_4 = 1$.\n\nWe have $a_5 = 996$.\n\nWe have $a_6 = 0$.\n\nWe have $a_7 = 996$.\n\nWe can see that the sequence $a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7$ will repeat.\n\nWe can see that the sequence $a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7$ is equivalent to the sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7$.\n\nThis means that we have $a_2 = 2$.\n\nHowever, we have $a_2 < 999$.\n\nThis means that we can eliminate $a_2 = 2$.\n\nWe are left with $a_2 = 997, 998$.\n\nHowever, we have to check if there are any other possible values of $a_2$.\n\nLet us consider the case when $a_2 = 3$.\n\nWe have $a_3 = |a_2 - a_1| = |3 - 999| = 996$.\n\nWe have $a_4 = 0$.\n\nWe have $a_5 = 996$.\n\nWe have $a_6 = 0$.\n\nWe have $a_7 = 996$.\n\nWe can see that the sequence $a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7$ will repeat.\n\nWe can see that the sequence $a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7$ is equivalent to the sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_"
