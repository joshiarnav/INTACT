    "problem": "A parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is reflected about the $x$-axis. The parabola and its reflection are translated horizontally five units in opposite directions to become the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$, respectively. Which of the following describes the graph of $y=(f+g)(x)$?\n\n(A) a parabola tangent to the $x$-axis\n(B) a parabola not tangent to the $x$-axis\n(C) a horizontal line\n(D) a non-horizontal line\n(E) the graph of a cubic function",
    "solution": "Write the equation of the original parabola as $y = a(x - h)^2 + k,$ where $a \\neq 0.$  Then the equation of the reflected parabola is\n\\[y = -a(x - h)^2 - k.\\]When the parabolas are translated horizontally by 5 units, in opposite directions, their equations become\n\\[y = a(x - h \\pm 5)^2 + k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -a(x - h \\mp 5)^2 - k.\\]The sum of these expressions is\n\\[\\pm 20ax \\mp 20ah = \\pm 20a (x - h),\\]which is the equation of a non-horizontal line.  The answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(D)}}.$",

    "model_solution": "Let's break this problem down step by step.\n\nWe start with a parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$. When this parabola is reflected about the $x$-axis, its equation becomes $y=-ax^2-bx-c$.\n\nNow we translate the original parabola and its reflection horizontally five units in opposite directions. The equation of the original parabola becomes $y=f(x)=a(x+5)^2+b(x+5)+c$, and the equation of the reflected parabola becomes $y=g(x)=-a(x-5)^2-b(x-5)-c$.\n\nWe want to find the equation of the graph of $y=(f+g)(x)$. To do this, we simply add the equations of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(f+g)(x)&=f(x)+g(x)\\\\\n&=a(x+5)^2+b(x+5)+c-a(x-5)^2-b(x-5)-c\\\\\n&=a(x^2+10x+25)+b(x+5)-a(x^2-10x+25)-b(x-5)\\\\\n&=a(x^2+10x+25-x^2+10x-25)-b(x-5-x-5)\\\\\n&=20ax.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $20a$ is just a constant, we can see that the graph of $y=(f+g)(x)$ is a non-horizontal line.\n\n$\\boxed{D}$"
