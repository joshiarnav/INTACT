    "problem": "For which value of $x$ does the function $f(x) = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}$ cross its horizontal asymptote?",
    "solution": "The horizontal asymptote of $f$ is the horizontal line that $f$ approaches as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. When the leading terms of the numerator and denominator have the same degree, that line is at the value equal to the ratio of the leading coefficients, namely $y = 2/1 = 2$. Setting this equal to $f(x)$, $$f(x) = 2 = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}.$$Clearing the denominator, $$2(x^2 - 4x + 1) = 2x^2 - 8x + 2 = 2x^2 - 5x - 7 \\Longrightarrow 3x = 9 \\Longrightarrow x = \\boxed{3}.$$",

    "model_solution": "To find the horizontal asymptote of the function $f(x) = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}$, we divide the leading terms of the numerator and denominator. The leading term of the numerator is $2x^2$ and the leading term of the denominator is $x^2$. \n\nThe horizontal asymptote is at $y = \\frac{2x^2}{x^2} = 2$. \n\nNow, we want to find the value of $x$ where the function crosses this horizontal asymptote. In other words, we set $f(x) = 2$ and solve for $x$.\n\n$\\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1} = 2$\n\nCross multiplying gives:\n\n$2x^2 - 5x - 7 = 2(x^2 - 4x + 1)$\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n$2x^2 - 5x - 7 = 2x^2 - 8x + 2$\n\nSubtracting $2x^2$ from both sides:\n\n$-5x - 7 = -8x + 2$\n\nAdding $8x$ to both sides:\n\n$3x - 7 = 2$\n\nAdding $7$ to both sides:\n\n$3x = 9$\n\nDividing by $3$:\n\n$x = 3$\n\nTherefore, the function crosses its horizontal asymptote at $x = \\boxed{3}$."
