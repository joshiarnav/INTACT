    "solution": "Since $-2 - 3i$ is a root\n\\[a (-2 - 3i)^3 + 3 (-2 - 3i)^2 + b (-2 - 3i) - 65 = 0.\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[(-80 + 46a - 2b) + (36 - 9a - 3b)i = 0.\\]Then $-80 + 46a - 2b = 0$ and $36 - 9a - 3b = 0.$  Solving, we find $a = 2$ and $b = 6.$\n\nThe cubic polynomial is then $2x^3 + 3x^2 + 6x - 65 = 0,$ which factors as $(2x - 5)(x^2 + 4x + 13) = 0.$  Therefore, the real root is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}.$",

    "model_solution": "Since $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, the complex conjugate of $-2 - 3i$ must also be a root, which is $-2 + 3i.$  We can use this information to write a quadratic polynomial that has these two roots. This quadratic will be of the form $x^2 + kx + m,$ where $k$ and $m$ are real numbers. Using the sum and product of roots to find $k$ and $m$:\n\\begin{align*}\nk &= 2\\cdot(-2 - 3i)\\\\\n&=-4-6i\n\\end{align*}and\n\\begin{align*}\nm &= (-2-3i)(-2+3i)\\\\\n&=(-2)^2-(3i)^2\\\\\n&=4+9\\\\\n&=13.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the quadratic polynomial with roots $-2 - 3i$ and $-2 + 3i$ is\n\\[p(x) = x^2 - (-4 - 6i)x + 13.\\]\nHowever, we want this quadratic to be real.  The real coefficients of the cubic polynomial suggest that we should multiply the quadratic above by its complex conjugate to obtain a real polynomial. To simplify this we  put the  top of the  $p(x)$ formula as follows\n\\begin{align*}\np(x) &= (x+4+6i)(x+4-6i)\n\\end{align*}\nMultiplying the two factors, we find that\n\\begin{align*}\np(x) &= (x+4)^2 - (6i)^2 \\\\\n&= x^2 +8x+16-(-36)\\\\\n&= x^2 +8x+52\n\\end{align*}We know that this quadratic has the same roots as our cubic, which are $-2 - 3i$ and $-2 + 3i.$  Therefore, we can write\n\\begin{align*}\na(x^2 + 8x + 52) + 3x + b &= 0.\n\\end{align*}Using the fact that the constant term in the cubic must be $-65,$ we know that\n\\begin{align*}\na(52) - 65 &= 0\\\\\n52a &= 65\\\\\na &= \\frac{65}{52}\\\\\n\\end{align*}Substituting the value of $a$ into the cubic, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{65}{52}(x^2 + 8x + 52) + 3x - b &= 0\n\\end{align*}Since  $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, we can  finish off  by multiplying the equation by $52$, to obtain:\n\\begin{align*}\n65(x^2 + 8x + 52) + 156x - 52b &= 0\\\\\n65x^2 + 520x + 3380 + 156x -52b &= 0\\\\\n65x^2 + 676x + 3380 - 52b &= 0\n\\end{align*}  Matching the coefficients of the  $x^2$ and $x$ terms to those in the original cubic, we can solve for the coefficients of the top two  terms of the cubic. We know that the coefficient  of the $x^2$ term in the cubic is 3, and the coefficient of the $x$ term is $b$. The coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the cubic is 3, and the coefficient of the $x$ term in the cubic is $b$. From this we know  that\n\\begin{align*}\n65 & = 3\\\\\n676 & = b.\n\\end{align*}\nSince this is impossible, we must have $a=3/65\\cdot52$  or\n\\begin{align*}\na & = \\frac{3\\cdot52}{65}\\\\\n  & =\\frac{156}{65}\n\\end{align*}Substituting the value of $a$ into the cubic, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{156}{65}(x^2 + 8x + 52) + 3x - b &= 0\n\\end{align*}Since  $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, we can  finish off  by multiplying the equation by $65$, to obtain:\n\\begin{align*}\n156(x^2 + 8x + 52) + 195x - 65b &= 0\\\\\n156x^2 + 1272x + 8064 + 195x -65b &= 0\\\\\n156x^2 + 1467x + 8064 - 65b &= 0\n\\end{align*}  Matching the coefficients of the  $x^2$ and $x$ terms to those in the original cubic, we can solve for the coefficients of the top two  terms of the cubic. We know that the coefficient  of the $x^2$ term in the cubic is 3, and the coefficient of the $x$ term is $b$. From this we know  that\n\\begin{align*}\n156 & = 3\\\\\n1467 &= b.\n\\end{align*}\nSince this is impossible,  we can manipulate the equation obtained above to find the value of $b$: \\begin{align*}\n- 65b  &= -8064- 1467\\cdot156\\\\\n- 65b  &= -8064 - 227772\\\\\n- 65b  &= -230836\\\\\n- b  &= \\frac{-230836}{65}\\\\\n- b  &= -3558.85\\\\\nb  & = 3558.85.\n\\end{align*}Substituting the value of $b$ into the cubic, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{156}{65}(x^2 + 8x + 52) + 3x - 3558.85 &= 0\n\\end{align*}Since  $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, we can  finish off  by multiplying the equation by $65$, to obtain:\n\\begin{align*}\n156(x^2 + 8x + 52) + 195x - 230836 &= 0\\\\\n156x^2 + 1272x + 8064 + 195x -230836 &= 0\\\\\n156x^2 + 1467x -230836 + 8064 &= 0\\\\\n156x^2 + 1467x - 223772 &= 0\n\\end{align*}  Matching the constant term to that in the original cubic, we can solve for the constant term of the cubic.
