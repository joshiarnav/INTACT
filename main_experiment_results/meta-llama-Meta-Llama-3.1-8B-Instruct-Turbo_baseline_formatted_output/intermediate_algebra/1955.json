However, before we do that we must isolate the cubic root. \n\n\\[\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + \\sqrt{x - 1} = 1.\\]\nLet's start by isolating the cubic root:\n\n\\[\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} = 1 - \\sqrt{x - 1}.\\]\n\nNow, let's cube both sides of the equation. \n\n\\[ (\\sqrt[3]{2 - x})^3 = (1 - \\sqrt{x - 1})^3. \\]\n\nThe LHS simplifies to:\n\\[2-x.\\]\n\nFor the RHS, we can expand the binomial:\n\\[ 1 - 3 \\sqrt{x - 1} + (x - 1) \\]\n\nEquating both sides we get:\n\\[ 2 - x = 1 - 3 \\sqrt{x - 1} + (x - 1) \\]\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\\[ 2 - 1 -  x + 1 = -3 \\sqrt{x - 1} \\]\n\\[ 2 = -3 \\sqrt{x - 1} + 2 - x \\]\n\\[ 2 - 2 = -3 \\sqrt{x - 1} - x \\]\n\\[ 0 = -3 \\sqrt{x - 1} - x \\]\n\nNow let's bring $x$ to one side:\n\\[ x = -3 \\sqrt{x - 1} \\]\n\nSquare both sides:\n\\[ (x)^2 = (-3 \\sqrt{x - 1})^2 \\]\n\\[ x^2 = 9 (x-1) \\]\n\\[ x^2 = 9 x - 9 \\]\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\\[ x^2 - 9 x + 9 = 0 \\]\n\nWe can factor the equation:\n\\[ (x-1)^2 = 0 \\]\n\nThe equation has equal roots:\n\\[ x = 1 \\]\n\nHowever, this is a problem because the original equation had a square root in it. We can't just plug it in to get a solution. We have to check if it is valid. \n\nWe get that x=1 when we cube both sides in the cubic root equation, however, x=1 gives us a zero denominator when we look at the original equation.
