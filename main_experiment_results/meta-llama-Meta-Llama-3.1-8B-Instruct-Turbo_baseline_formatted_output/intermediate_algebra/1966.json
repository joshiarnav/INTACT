    "model_solution": "To find the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$, we need to express $a_2$ and $a_3$ in terms of the common ratio $r$ of the geometric sequence. We know that:\n\n$a_1 = 1$\n$a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r = r$\n$a_3 = a_2 \\cdot r = r^2$\n\nThen, we can express $4a_2 + 5a_3$ in terms of $r$:\n\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2$\n\nWe want to minimize the expression $4r + 5r^2$. Since this is a quadratic expression, its minimum value will occur at the vertex of the parabola. To find the vertex, we can use the formula $r = -\\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ is the coefficient of the $r^2$ term and $b$ is the coefficient of the $r$ term:\n\n$r = -\\frac{5}{2 \\cdot 5} = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThen, we can plug this value of $r$ into the expression $4r + 5r^2$ to find the minimum value:\n\n$4 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 5 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = -2 + \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{5}{4} - 2 = \\frac{5 - 8}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4}$\n\nHowever, the value of $r$ must make the expression $4r + 5r^2$ negative or zero, because we're adding terms with the same sign.  Therefore, the minimum value is when $r = - \\frac{1}{2}$, and:\n\n$4r + 5r^2 = 4(-\\frac{1}{2}) + 5(-\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\boxed{-\\frac{3}{4}}$"
