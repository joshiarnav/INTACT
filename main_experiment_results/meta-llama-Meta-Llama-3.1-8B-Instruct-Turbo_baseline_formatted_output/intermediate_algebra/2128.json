    "problem": "One of the asymptotes of a hyperbola has equation $y=3x.$ The foci of the hyperbola have the same $x-$coordinate, which is $5.$ Find the equation of the other asymptote of the hyperbola, giving your answer in the form \"$y = mx + b$\".",
    "solution": "Because the foci both lie on the line $x=5$ and the center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the segment connecting the foci, the center must also lie on the line $x=5.$ However, we also know that the asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at the center. Therefore, the center of the hyperbola lies on both the line $x=5$ and the line $y=3x,$ so its coordinates are $(5, 15).$\n\nBecause the hyperbola has a horizontal axis, the other asymptote must have slope $-3.$ Therefore, we can write a point-slope equation for the other asymptote: \\[y - 15 = -3(x - 5),\\]which is equivalent to $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}.$",

    "model_solution": "Since the foci have the same x-coordinate, the center of the hyperbola must also have the same x-coordinate, which is 5. \n\nAs the asymptotes intersect at the center, we know that the line y = 3x must pass through the center (5, 15). \n\nSince the asymptotes are symmetric about the center, the other asymptote must be of the form y = mx + b, where m is the negative of the slope of the first asymptote.\n\nThe slope of y = 3x is 3, so the slope of the other asymptote is -3. The equation of the other asymptote is y = -3x + b.\n\nSince the other asymptote passes through the center (5, 15), we can substitute these values into the equation to find b.\n\n15 = -3(5) + b\n15 = -15 + b\nb = 30\n\nSo the equation of the other asymptote is y = -3x + 30.\n\n$\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}$"
