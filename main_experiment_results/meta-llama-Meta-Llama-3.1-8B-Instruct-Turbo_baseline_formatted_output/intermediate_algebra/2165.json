    "model_solution": "To find the remainder when a polynomial is divided by another polynomial, we can use the Remainder Theorem. \n\nThe divisor is $2x - 6$ which can be rewritten as $2(x - 3)$.\n\nAccording to the Remainder Theorem, the remainder of a polynomial f(x) divided by $(x - a)$ is equal to f(a).\n\nSo, to find the remainder, we substitute $x = 3$ into the polynomial.\n\nThe polynomial is $6x^4 - 14x^3 - ox^2 + 2x - 26$.\n\nSubstituting $x = 3$, we get:\n\n$6(3)^4 - 14(3)^3 - 4(3)^2 + 2(3) - 26$\n\n$= 6(81) - 14(27) - 4(9) + 6 - 26$\n\n$= 486 - 378 - 36 + 6 - 26$\n\n$= 52$\n\nSo, the remainder is $\\boxed{52}$."
