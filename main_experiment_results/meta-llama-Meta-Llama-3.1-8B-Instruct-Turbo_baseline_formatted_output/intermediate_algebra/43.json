    "model_solution": "To find how many values of $z$ satisfy both $|z| = 5$ and $f(z) = z$, we first need to understand what $f(z) = z$ implies.\n\nLet $z = a + bi$. Then $\\overline{z} = a - bi$. We are given that $f(z) = i\\overline{z}$, so $f(z) = i(a - bi)$. Simplifying, we get $f(z) = ia - bi^2$. Since $i^2 = -1$, we have $f(z) = ia + b$. For $f(z) = z$, we must have $ia + b = a + bi$. This implies that $a = b$.\n\nNow we are given that $|z| = 5$. We can express $|z|$ as $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. Since $|z| = 5$, we have $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 5$. Squaring both sides, we get $a^2 + b^2 = 25$. We know that $a = b$, so we substitute $a$ for $b$ to get $a^2 + a^2 = 25$. This simplifies to $2a^2 = 25$. Dividing both sides by $2$, we get $a^2 = \\frac{25}{2}$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $a = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{2}} = \\pm \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nSince $a = b$, we have $b = \\pm \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}}$. We can now find the values of $z$ that satisfy both $|z| = 5$ and $f(z) = z$.\n\n$z = a + bi = \\pm \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}} \\pm \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}}i$\n\nWe have two possible solutions, one for each sign combination of $a$ and $b$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{2}$ values of $z$ that satisfy both $|z| = 5$ and $f(z) = z$."
