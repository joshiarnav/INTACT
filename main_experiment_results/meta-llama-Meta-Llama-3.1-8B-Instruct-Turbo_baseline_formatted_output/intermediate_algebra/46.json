By the Remainder Theorem, f(1) should be equal to -5. \n\nf(x) = ax^3 - 6x^2 + bx - 5\nf(1) = a(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + b(1) - 5\nf(1) = a - 6 + b - 5\nf(1) = a + b - 11\n\nSince f(1) = -5, we have a + b - 11 = -5. \n\nSimplifying, we have a + b = 6.\n\nNow, when f(x) is divided by x + 2, the remainder is -53. By the Remainder Theorem, f(-2) should be equal to -53.\n\nf(x) = ax^3 - 6x^2 + bx - 5\nf(-2) = a(-2)^3 - 6(-2)^2 + b(-2) - 5\nf(-2) = -8a - 24 - 2b - 5\nf(-2) = -8a - 2b - 29\n\nSince f(-2) = -53, we have -8a - 2b - 29 = -53.\n\nSimplifying, we have -8a - 2b = -24.\n\nDividing both sides by -2, we have 4a + b = 12.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n1) a + b = 6\n2) 4a + b = 12\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we have 3a = 6.\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we have a = 2.\n\nSubstituting a = 2 into the first equation, we have 2 + b = 6.\n\nSimplifying, we have b = 4.\n\nThe ordered pair (a, b) is (2, 4).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n$\\boxed{(2,4)}$"
