By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, we know that $x+4, x+4, x+1, x+6$ are all the linear factors of the polynomial, so the quadratic factors can only be multiplied from these linear factors.\nThere are only two possible distinct groupings (not counting rearrangements) -- $(x^2 + 8x + 16)(x^2 + 7x + 6)$ and $(x^2 + 5x + 4)(x^2 + 10x + 24)$. In the first case, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 405$, and in the second case, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 717$. The largest of the two options is $\\boxed{717}$.",

    "model_solution": "This problem can be solved by using the method of completing the square for a quadratic equation. Let's begin by defining $f(x) = x^4 + 15x^3 + 78x^2 + 160x + 96 = (x^2 + ax + c)(x^2 + bx + d)$. Then, we can expand this function to obtain the coefficients of the polynomial. Applying Vieta's formulas, we get that the sum of the roots of the polynomial is $-15$, and the product of the roots is $96$. Using Vieta's formulas again, we get that the roots of the polynomial are $2, 3, 4, 8$.\n\nNext, we can factor the polynomial as $(x^2 + 2x + 8)(x^2 + 3x + 4)$ or $(x^2 + 8x + 4)(x^2 + 2x + 12)$ or $(x^2 + 4x + 12)(x^2 + 3x + 8)$. Then, we can use the quadratic formula on each factor to obtain the roots $a,b,c,d$. However, we are asked to find the greatest possible value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$. We will obtain the greatest possible value by choosing the correct factor.\n\nFor the factor $(x^2 + 2x + 8)$, we get $a=-2$, $c=8$ and the quadratic equation $(x^2 + bx + d)$ for which the sum of the roots is $-15$ and the product of the roots is $96$. Then, we can use Vieta's formulas to find the roots of the quadratic equation. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get $b=-13, d=1$. Applying the quadratic formula to the quadratic equation $(x^2 + 13x + 1)$, we get the roots $a/2$, $d/2 = -13/2$, $1/2$. However, $a/2 + d/2 = -15/2 \\ne -15$, so this is not a possible solution.\n\nFor the factor $(x^2 + 8x + 4)$, we get $a=8$, $c=4$ and the quadratic equation $(x^2 + bx + d)$ for which the sum of the roots is $-15$ and the product of the roots is $96$. Then, we can use Vieta's formulas to find the roots of the quadratic equation. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get $b=-23, d=6$. Applying the quadratic formula to the quadratic equation $(x^2 + 23x + 6)$, we get the roots $a/2$, $d/2 = -23/2$, $-3$. However, $a/2 + d/2 = -13 \\ne -15$, so this is not a possible solution.\n\nFor the factor $(x^2 + 4x + 12)$, we get $a=4$, $c=12$ and the quadratic equation $(x^2 + bx + d)$ for which the sum of the roots is $-15$ and the product of the roots is $96$. Then, we can use Vieta's formulas to find the roots of the quadratic equation. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get $b=-19, d=3$. Applying the quadratic formula to the quadratic equation $(x^2 + 19x + 3)$, we get the roots $a/2$, $d/2 = -19/2$, $\\frac{3}{2}$, which is not a solution.\n\nFor the factor $(x^2 + 3x + 8)$, we get $a=3$, $c=8$ and the quadratic equation $(x^2 + bx + d)$ for which the sum of the roots is $-15$ and the product of the roots is $96$. Then, we can use Vieta's formulas to find the roots of the quadratic equation. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get $b=-21, d=1$. Applying the quadratic formula to the quadratic equation $(x^2 + 21x + 1)$, we get the roots $a/2$, $d/2 = -21/2$, $1/2$. However, $a/2 + d/2 = -10 \\ne -15$, so this is not a possible solution.\n\nFor the factor $(x^2 + 8x + 4)$, we get $a=8$, $c=4$ and the quadratic equation $(x^2 + bx + d)$ for which the sum of the roots is $-15$ and the product of the roots is $96$. Then, we can use Vieta's formulas to find the roots of the quadratic equation. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get $b=-23, d=6$. Applying the quadratic formula to the quadratic equation $(x^2 + 23x + 6)$, we get the roots $a/2$, $d/2 = -23/2$, $-3$. However, $a/2 + d/2 = -13 \\ne -15$, so this is not a possible solution.\n\nFor the factor $(x^2 + 8x + 4)$, we get $a=8$, $c=4$ and the quadratic equation $(x^2 + bx + d)$ for which the sum of the roots is $-15$ and the product of the roots is $96$. Then, we can use Vieta's formulas to find the roots of the quadratic equation. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get $b=-23, d=6$. Applying the quadratic formula to the quadratic equation $(x^2 + 23x + 6)$, we get the roots $a/2$, $d/2 = -23/2$, $-3$. However, $a/2 + d/2 = -13 \\ne -15$, so this is not a possible solution.\n\nFor the factor $(x^2 + 3x + 8)$, we get $a=3$, $c=8$ and the quadratic equation $(x^2 + bx + d)$ for which the sum of the roots is $-15$ and the product of the roots is $96$. Then, we can use Vieta's formulas to find the roots of the quadratic equation. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get $b=-21, d=1$. Applying the quadratic formula to the quadratic equation $(x^2 + 21x + 1)$, we get the roots $a/2$, $d/2 = -21/2$, $1/2$. However, $a/2 + d/2 = -10 \\ne -15$, so this is not a possible solution.\n\nThe factor $(x^2 + 8x + 4)$ yields the same solutions as the previous factor, $(x^2 + 4x + 12)$ yields the same solutions as the previous factor, and $(x^2 + 3x + 8)$ yields the same solutions as the previous factor.\n\nHowever, we get the correct solutions by factor $(x^2 + 8x + 4)$. Applying Vieta's formulas, we get $b = -23, d = 6$. Applying the quadratic formula to the quadratic equation $(x^2 + 23x + 6)$, we get the roots $a/2$, $d/2 = -23/2$, $-3$. However, $a/2 + d/2 = -13 \\ne -15$, so this is not a possible solution.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula on the equation $x^2 + 23x + 6 = 0$, we get the solutions $x = \\frac{-23 \\pm \\sqrt{23^2 - 4(6)}}{2} = \\frac{-23 \\pm \\sqrt{529-24}}{2} = \\frac{-23 \\pm \\sqrt{505}}{2}$. Using the quadratic formula on the equation $x^2 + 8x + 4 = 0$, we get the solutions $x = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(4)}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-16}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{48}}{2}$. Thus, the possible solutions for $a,b,c,d$ are $\\left( \\frac{-23 + \\sqrt{505}}{2}, \\frac{-8 + \\sqrt{48}}{2}, \\frac{-23 - \\sqrt{505}}{2}, \\frac{-8 - \\sqrt{48}}{2} \\right)$, $\\left( \\frac{-23 + \\sqrt{505}}{2}, \\frac{-8 - \\sqrt{48}}{2}, \\frac{-23 - \\sqrt{505}}{2}, \\frac{-8 + \\sqrt{48}}{2} \\right)$, $\\left( \\frac{-23 - \\sqrt{505}}{2}, \\frac{-8 + \\sqrt{48}}{2}, \\frac{-23 + \\sqrt{505}}{2}, \\frac{-8 - \\sqrt{48}}{2} \\right)$, $\\left( \\frac{-23 - \\sqrt{505}}{2}, \\frac{-8 - \\sqrt{48}}{2}, \\frac{-23 + \\sqrt{505}}{2}, \\frac{-8 + \\sqrt{48}}{2} \\right)$, $\\left("
