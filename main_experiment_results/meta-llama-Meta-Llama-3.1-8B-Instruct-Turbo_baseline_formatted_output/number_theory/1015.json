    "problem": "If the seven-digit number $854n526$ is divisible by $11$, what is $n$?",
    "solution": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find if a number is divisible by 11, we need to find the difference between the sum of the digits at the odd positions and the sum of the digits at the even positions. \n\nIn the number $854n526$, the odd-positioned digits are 8 (1st position), 4 (3rd position), 6 (5th position), and 2 (7th position). The even-positioned digits are 5 (2nd position), 5 (4th position), and 6 (6th position), and finally the digit $n$ (8th position) which is at an odd position but we are considering it as a separate case.\n\nThe sum of the digits at the odd positions is $8 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 20$. \nThe sum of the digits at the even positions is $5 + 5 + 6 = 16$. \n\nNow, we need to consider the digit $n$ which we are considering separately at an odd position, so the new sum of odd-positioned digits is 20 + $n$. \n\nAccording to the divisibility rule for 11, the difference between the two sums should be either 0 or a multiple of 11. So, we can set up the equation:\n20 + $n$ - 16 = 0 or a multiple of 11\n\nSimplifying the equation gives us:\n$4 + n$ = 0 or a multiple of 11\n\nSolving for $n$ gives us:\n$n$ = -3 or 7 (since it should be a multiple of 11)\n\nConsidering the first case of $n$ being 7, we get: \n20 + 7 - 16 = 11 which is a multiple of 11, so the answer is $\\boxed{7}$."
