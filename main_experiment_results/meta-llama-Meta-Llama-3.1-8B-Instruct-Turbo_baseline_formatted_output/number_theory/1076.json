    "problem": "What is the digit in the tens place when $7^{2005}$ is expressed in decimal notation?",
    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of the last two digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $07, 49, 43, 01, 07, 49, 43, 01,\\ldots$ . The cycle of the last two digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 numbers long: 07, 49, 43, 01. Thus, to find the tens digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=0$ or 1 corresponds to the tens digit 0, and $R=2$ or 3 corresponds to the units digit 4). Since $2005\\div4=501R1$, the tens digit of $7^{2005}$ is $ \\boxed{0}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the digit in the tens place when $7^{2005}$ is expressed in decimal notation, we first need to look for a pattern in the last two digits of powers of 7.\n\nCalculating the first few powers of 7 gives us: \n$7^0$ = 1\n$7^1$ = 7\n$7^2$ = 49\n$7^3$ = 343 \n$7^4$ = 2401\n$7^5$ = 16807\n$7^6$ = 117649\n$7^7$ = 823543\n$7^8$ = 5764801 \n\nLooking at the last two digits of $7^4$ to $7^8$, we can see a pattern where the last two digits repeat every 4 powers of 7, i.e., 01, 07, 49, 43. Now we need to find where $7^{2005}$ falls in this 4-term cycle.\n\nWe can use the modulo operator to find the remainder when 2005 is divided by 4. 2005 mod 4 = 1. This means that $7^{2005}$ will have the same last two digits as $7^1$, which is 07.\n\nHence, the digit in the tens place when $7^{2005}$ is expressed in decimal notation is 0.\n\n$\\boxed{0}$"
