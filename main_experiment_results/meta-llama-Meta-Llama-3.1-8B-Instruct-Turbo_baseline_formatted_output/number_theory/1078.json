    "problem": "When an integer is divided by 15, the remainder is 7. Find the sum of the remainders when the same integer is divided by 3 and by 5.",
    "solution": "We let our integer be $n$.  the first sentence tells us that  \\[n\\equiv 7\\pmod {15}.\\] Since 3 and 5 are both factors of 15 we deduce \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv2\\pmod5.\n\\end{align*} Therefore the remainders in question are 1 and 2, and their sum is $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "Since the remainder is 7 when an integer is divided by 15, we can express the integer as 15k + 7, where k is an integer.\n\nNow, let's find the remainders when this integer is divided by 3 and by 5.\n\nWhen 15k + 7 is divided by 3, the remainder will be the same as when 7 is divided by 3:\n\n7 \u00f7 3 = 2 with a remainder of 1.\n\nSo, the remainder when the integer is divided by 3 is 1.\n\nWhen 15k + 7 is divided by 5, the remainder will be the same as when 7 is divided by 5:\n\n7 \u00f7 5 = 1 with a remainder of 2.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the integer is divided by 5 is 2.\n\nThe sum of the remainders is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{3}$."
