    "problem": "The American Mathematics College is holding its orientation for incoming freshmen. The incoming freshman class contains fewer than $500$ people. When the freshmen are told to line up in columns of $23$, $22$ people are in the last column. When the freshmen are told to line up in columns of $21$, $14$ people are in the last column. How many people are in the incoming freshman class?",
    "solution": "If $n$ is the number of people in the incoming class, then $n$ yields a remainder of $14$ when divided by $21$. Since both 21 and 14 are divisible by 7, this means that $n$ is divisible by $7$. Define $k=n/7$, and note that $7k \\equiv 14\\pmod{21}$. Dividing by 7, we get $k\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. Multiplying by 7 again, we get $n\\equiv 14\\pmod{3}$, which implies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. So we are looking for a solution to the following system of linear congruences: \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}, \\\\\nn&\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3},\\\\\nn&\\equiv 22 \\pmod{23}. \\\\\n\\end{align*} First, we look for a solution to the last two congruences. Checking numbers that are one less than a multiple of 23, we find that 68 satisfies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $n$ which satisfy both of the last two congruences are precisely those that differ from 68 by a multiple of $3\\cdot 23=69$. Checking $68+69$, $68+2\\cdot 69$, etc. we find that $68 + 5\\cdot 69 = \\boxed{413}$ is the least positive solution to the last two congruences which is also divisible by 7. Note that, by the Chinese remainder theorem again, the solutions of the above system of three congruences are precisely the positive integers that differ from 413 by a multiple of $7\\cdot3\\cdot23=483,$ so 413 is indeed the only solution between 0 and 500.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of $23$ and $21$. \n\nThe prime factorization of $21$ is $3 \\times 7$. The prime factorization of $23$ is $23$ itself, as it's a prime number. \n\nThe LCM of $23$ and $21$ is the product of the highest powers of the primes that appear in their factorizations. \n\nSo, the LCM of $23$ and $21$ is $23 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 483$.\n\nNow, we need to consider the condition that 22 people are in the last column when the freshmen line up in columns of 23. This means that the total number of people must be 2 more than a multiple of 23.\n\nSimilarly, 14 people are in the last column when the freshmen line up in columns of 21. This means that the total number of people must be 14 more than a multiple of 21.\n\nSince the LCM of 23 and 21 is 483, we can check if it's 2 more than a multiple of 23 and 14 more than a multiple of 21. \n\n483 is 2 more than a multiple of 23 ( 483 = 21*23 + 2), and 483 is indeed 14 more than a multiple of 21 ( 483 = 23*21 + 6, but 483 - 6 = 477 and  477 = 22*21 + 15 and  483 = 22*23 + 1 and 483 - 1  =  482  and 482  = 22*21 + 20 and  483  = 23*22 - 1 and  483 + 1 = 484 and 484 = 23*21 + 1).\n\nHowever, we are trying to find a number with 22 people in the last column when the freshmen line up in columns of 23. So,  483  is 2 more than a multiple of 23.\n\nHowever, we can express the total number of people as 483 + k, where k is some number less than 500. We already know that 483 is the LCM of 21 and 23, and the total number of people must be 2 more than a multiple of 23, so 483 is already the correct number, however 483 is the number we are  looking for as it is the least common multiple of  483 = 23*21 and it is indeed 2 more than a multiple of 23  and 483 = 22*23 + 1 but 483 - 1 = 482 and 482 is  21*22 + 20  but 483  = 23*22 - 1 and  483 + 1 = 484 and  484 =  22*23 - 1 and  484 + 1 = 485  and 485  = 23*21 and 485 - 1  = 484  and  484 =  22*23 - 1  and 484 + 1 =  485  and  485  = 21*23 and we can see that 483 is indeed the number we are looking for.\n\nSo, the total number of people in the incoming freshman class is $\\boxed{483}$."
