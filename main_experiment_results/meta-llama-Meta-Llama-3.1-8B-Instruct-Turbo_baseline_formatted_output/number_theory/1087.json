    "problem": "What is the $100$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{3}{26}$ is expressed as a decimal?",
    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block. We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$. Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To express $\\frac{3}{26}$ as a decimal, we perform long division to get the decimal representation.\n\nDividing 3 by 26, we get:\n\n 0.1 384615\n\nThe pattern 384615 repeats every six digits, as this is the length of the repeating block. This pattern will continue indefinitely.\n\nSince we're looking for the $100$th digit after the decimal point, we first find the remainder when $100$ is divided by 6, which is 4. \n\nSo, we're looking for the $4$th digit in the repeating block. The repeating block is 384615, and the $4$th digit is 6.\n\nTherefore, the $100$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{3}{26}$ is expressed as a decimal is $\\boxed{6}$."
