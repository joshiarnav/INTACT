    "problem": "Find the value of $b$ that satisfies the equation $161_{b}+134_{b}=315_{b}$.",
    "solution": "In the rightmost column there is no carrying, so our base must be greater than 5. However, in the next column we see that $6_{b}+3_{b}=11_{b}$. This tells us that $b$ divides into 9 once, with a remainder 1. Therefore, $b=\\boxed{8}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve for $b$, we need to convert the numbers from base $b$ to base 10 and then solve the equation.\n\nFirst, let's convert the numbers:\n\n$161_{b} = 1b^2 + 6b + 1$\n$134_{b} = 1b^2 + 3b + 4$\n$315_{b} = 3b^2 + 1b + 5$\n\nNow, let's rewrite the equation using the base 10 equivalents:\n\n$(1b^2 + 6b + 1) + (1b^2 + 3b + 4) = (3b^2 + 1b + 5)$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$2b^2 + 9b + 5 = 3b^2 + 1b + 5$\n\nSubtract $3b^2 + 1b + 5$ from both sides:\n\n$-b^2 + 8b = 0$\n\nDivide both sides by $-b$:\n\n$b - 8 = 0$\n\nAdd 8 to both sides:\n\n$b = 8$\n\nTherefore, the value of $b$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{8}$."
