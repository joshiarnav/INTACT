We can check that our answer works by plugging our value for triangle into the original problem: $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & 3 & 2 & 1 & 5_6\\\\ & & & 5 & 4 & 0_6\\\\ &+ & & & 5 & 2_6\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & 4 & 2 & 5 & 1_6.\\\\ \\end{array} $$The addition problem still works, so our answer is correct.",

    "model_solution": "To solve for $\\triangle$, we will start from the rightmost column and move to the left.\n\n1. In the rightmost column, we have $\\triangle + 2 = 1_6$. Since we're working in base 6, we need to consider the possibility of a carry. However, we know that $\\triangle + 2$ must be greater than or equal to 6 (because 1 in base 6 is equivalent to 1 in base 10). Therefore, the only possibility is $\\triangle + 2 = 11_6$, which means $\\triangle = 5$.\n\nNow, let's check our result by substituting $\\triangle = 5$ into the original problem:\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & 3 & 2 & 1 & 5_6\\\\ & & & 5 & 4 & 0_6\\\\ &+ & & & 5 & 2_6\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & 4 & 2 & 5 & 1_6\\\\ \\end{array} $$\n\nThe result matches the original problem, so we can conclude that $\\triangle = 5$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$."
