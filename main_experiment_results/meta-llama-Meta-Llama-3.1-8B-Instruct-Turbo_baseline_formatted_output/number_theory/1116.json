    "problem": "What is the sum of all integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer?",
    "solution": "The expression $2n-1$ is odd for every integer $n$, and conversely every odd integer takes the form $2n-1$ for some integer $n$.  Therefore, there is one solution $n$ for each (not necessarily positive) odd divisor of 20.  The positive odd divisors of 20 are 1 and 5, so we solve $2n-1=-5$, $2n-1=-1$, $2n-1=1$, and $2n-1=5$ to find the solutions $n=-2$, $n=0$, $n=1$, and $n=3$.  These values for $n$ sum to $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the values of n such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer, we need to find the divisors of 20.\n\nThe divisors of 20 are: 1, -1, 2, -2, 4, -4, 5, -5, 10, -10, 20, and -20.\n\nNow, we need to find the values of n such that $2n-1$ is a divisor of 20.\n\n- For $2n-1 = 1$, we get $n = 1$.\n- For $2n-1 = -1$, we get $n = 0$.\n- For $2n-1 = 2$, we get $n = \\frac{3}{2}$ (not an integer).\n- For $2n-1 = -2$, we get $n = -\\frac{1}{2}$ (not an integer).\n- For $2n-1 = 4$, we get $n = 2.5$ (not an integer).\n- For $2n-1 = -4$, we get $n = -2.5$ (not an integer).\n- For $2n-1 = 5$, we get $n = 3$.\n- For $2n-1 = -5$, we get $n = -2$.\n- For $2n-1 = 10$, we get $n = 5.5$ (not an integer).\n- For $2n-1 = -10$, we get $n = -4.5$ (not an integer).\n- For $2n-1 = 20$, we get $n = 10.5$ (not an integer).\n- For $2n-1 = -20$, we get $n = -9.5$ (not an integer).\n\nTherefore, the values of n such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer are -2, 0, 1, and 3.\n\nThe sum of these values is $-2 + 0 + 1 + 3 = \\boxed{2}$."
