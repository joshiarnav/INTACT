    "solution": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7. So the residue of the sum is  $$\n182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\equiv \\boxed{10} \\pmod{14}.\n$$",

    "model_solution": "To find the residue, we need to find the residue of each term in the expression modulo 14.\n\nFirst, let's find the residue of $182\\cdot 12 \\pmod{14}$. \n\nSince $182 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{14}$, we have that $182\\cdot 12 \\equiv 0 \\cdot 12 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{14}$.\n\nNext, let's find the residue of $15\\cdot 7 \\pmod{14}$.\n\nSince $15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{14}$, we have that $15\\cdot 7 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 7 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{14}$.\n\nFinally, let's find the residue of $3 \\pmod{14}$.\n\n$3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{14}$.\n\nNow, let's substitute these residues into the original expression:\n\n$182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\pmod{14}$.\n\nSince we want the residue to be positive, we can add 14 to -4 to get:\n\n$-4 + 14 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{14}$.\n\nSo, the residue of $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\pmod{14}$ is $\\boxed{10}$."
