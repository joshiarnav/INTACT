    "model_solution": "The smallest two-digit multiple of 7 is 14, and the largest is 98. \n\nTo find the number of terms in the sequence, we can find the position of the largest term. We can do this by finding the number of multiples of 7 between 1 and 98. \n\nWe can write this as $\\frac{98}{7} \\approx 14.$ However, we know that 14 is included in the sequence, so we add 1 to get the total number of terms as 15.\n\nNow we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \n$\\frac{n(a + l)}{2}$ where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get \n$\\frac{15(14 + 98)}{2} = \\frac{15 \\times 112}{2} = \\frac{1680}{2} = 840$\n\nTo find the arithmetic mean, we divide the sum by the number of terms. \n$\\frac{840}{15} = 56.$\n\nSo, the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7 is $\\boxed{56}$."
