    "problem": "What is $2343_6+15325_6$? Express your answer in base $6$.",
    "solution": "Adding the first digits, we get $8$, hence $2$ after carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, again with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $2$, with carrying. Finally, adding $1$ to one, we get $2$. Thus our final answer is $\\boxed{22112_6}$.",

    "model_solution": "To add these two numbers in base 6, we will perform the addition column by column, similar to base 10 addition.\n\nFirst, we will add the rightmost column.\n\n- The rightmost column is 3 and 5, add them together which gives us 12 in base 10. Convert 12 to base 6 which is 20. We will write 0 down and carry over 2.\n\nNext, we add the next column.\n\n- The next column is 4 and 2, add them together which gives us 6 in base 10. Convert 6 to base 6 which is 12. We will write 2 down and carry over 1.\n\nThen, we add the next column.\n\n- The next column is 2 and 5, add the carry over 1 to them which gives us 8 in base 10. Convert 8 to base 6 which is 14. We will write 4 down and carry over 1.\n\nAfter that, we add the next column.\n\n- The next column is 1 and 3, add the carry over 1 to them which gives us 5 in base 10. Convert 5 to base 6 which is 5. We will write 5 down.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost column.\n\n- The leftmost column is 0 and 0.\n\nPutting all these numbers together, we get:\n\n$12445_6$\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{12445_6}$."
