    "problem": "What is the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25?",
    "solution": "Every multiple of 25 ends in 00, 25, 50, or 75.  Since we want the product of the digits to be a positive multiple of 25, the final two digits must be either 25 or 75.\n\nA nonzero product of digits is a multiple of 25 exactly when two or more of the digits is are equal to 5. If a number ends in 75 and the product of its digits is a multiple of 25, then replacing 75 by 25 in that number will also give a smaller number whose product of digits is a multiple of 25.  Therefore we are looking for a number whose final two digits are 25 and for which 5 is one of the other digits.\n\nSince 525 is the smallest such number, the answer must be $\\boxed{525}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25, we need to find a number that is a multiple of 25 and also has at least one 5 and one 2 in its digits, since 25 = 5 * 5 and the product of its digits must be a multiple of 25.\n\nThe number 525 is a multiple of 25 and has two 5's, but the product of its digits is 5 * 2 * 5 = 50, which is a multiple of 25.\n\nTo ensure that the product of its digits is the least possible, we should try to minimize the other digits. Since 525 is already the smallest possible three-digit number with two 5's, we can conclude that the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25 is 525.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{525}$."
