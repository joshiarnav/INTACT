    "problem": "A divisor of a number is a proper divisor if it is not equal to the number. What is the sum of the proper divisors of $432$?",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $432 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^3$. It follows that the sum of the divisors is equal to $(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4)(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3)$, as each factor of $432$ is represented when the product is expanded. We have to subtract $432$ so that we only count the proper divisors, so the answer is \\begin{align*}\n(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16)(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) - 432 &= (31)(40) - 432\\\\\n&= 1240 - 432\\\\\n&= \\boxed{808}.\\\\\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the proper divisors of 432, we can first factorize 432. \n\n432 = 2^4 * 3^3\n\nThe sum of divisors can be found using the formula:\n\nSum of divisors = (p^0 + p^1 + ... + p^n) * (q^0 + q^1 + ... + q^m)\n\nwhere p and q are the prime factors and n and m are their respective exponents.\n\nFor 432 = 2^4 * 3^3, the sum of divisors would be:\n(2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4) * (3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3)\n= (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16) * (1 + 3 + 9 + 27)\n= 31 * 40\n= 1240\n\nHowever, the sum of proper divisors is the sum of divisors excluding the number itself. So we need to subtract 432 from the sum of divisors:\nSum of proper divisors = 1240 - 432\n= 808\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of 432 is $\\boxed{808}$."
