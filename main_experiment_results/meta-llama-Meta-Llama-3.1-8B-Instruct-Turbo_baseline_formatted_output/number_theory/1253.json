    "problem": "What is the largest number, with its digits all different, whose digits add up to 16?",
    "solution": "For a number to be as large as possible, we want as many places (digits) as possible. To allow for as many digits as possible, we want the digits to be small so that there will be more digits that add up to $16$. We start with the smallest number, $0$ and keep adding the next number. $0+1+2+3+4=10$. However, we cannot add $5$, because then we are left with $16-10-5=1$, and we already have the number $1$. Therefore, the next number to be added would be $16-10=6$.\nNow, we have the numbers $0,1,2,3,4,6$ to form a number. We want the larger places to have larger numbers. Therefore, we order the numbers in decreasing order to form the number $\\boxed{643210}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest number with all different digits that add up to 16, we should try to use the largest digits possible. \n\nStarting from 9, we try to use the largest digits while adding up to 16. \n\n9 + 7 = 16, so we can use 9 and 7 as our digits. However, we need 7 more digits to make the number larger. But we cannot use 7 again because all the digits should be different. \n\n9 + 6 = 15, 15 + 1 = 16, so we can use 9, 6, and 1 as our digits. Now we need 4 more digits to make the number larger. \n\nSince we cannot use 9, 6, or 1 again, we try to use the next largest digits. 8 + 5 + 3 = 16, so we can use 8, 5, and 3 as our digits. Now we have 0 left to use 4 different digits. \n\nOur 4 remaining digits are 4, 2, and the two remaining digits from our previous two sets of 3 digits. We got one of the remaining digits from 9, 6, 1, that is 1. But we can't use it. The other remaining digit is 7. \n\nSo we can make a number with the digits 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 1. The largest number with these digits would be 98765431. \n\nSo, $\\boxed{98765431}$ is the largest number with its digits all different that add up to 16."
