    "problem": "What is the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 which has two even and two odd digits?",
    "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits, we need to consider the divisibility rule for 9, which states that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 9.\n\nWe want the smallest four-digit number, so let's start with 1000. The sum of the digits is 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1, which is not divisible by 9.\n\nWe need to increase the digits to get a sum that is divisible by 9. Let's try 1002. The sum of the digits is 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 3, which is also not divisible by 9.\n\nNow, let's try 1003. The sum of the digits is 1 + 0 + 0 + 3 = 4, which is still not divisible by 9.\n\nMoving on, let's try 1004. The sum of the digits is 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 5, which is also not divisible by 9.\n\nLet's try 1005. The sum of the digits is 1 + 0 + 0 + 5 = 6, which is not divisible by 9.\n\nWe can keep increasing the digits, but we can also try rearranging the digits to get a smaller number. \n\nSince we need two even and two odd digits, we can start with the two even digits as 0 and 8. \n\nThe sum of the digits of 1080 is 1 + 0 + 8 + 0 = 9, which is divisible by 9.\n\nHowever, this is not the smallest possible number. We can try swapping the tens and units digits to get a smaller number.\n\nThe sum of the digits of 1089 is 1 + 0 + 8 + 9 = 18, which is also divisible by 9.\n\nHowever, we can see that 1089 is the smallest possible number with two even and two odd digits that is divisible by 9.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits is $\\boxed{1089}$."
