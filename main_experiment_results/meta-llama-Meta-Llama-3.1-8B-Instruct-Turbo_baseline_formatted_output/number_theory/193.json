    "solution": "We start by testing palindromic sequences in base 4. Since the positive integer must be greater than 5, we start by analyzing $22_4$, which is $1010_2$. We then test $33_4$, which is $1111_2$. Converting to base 10, we have $33_4 = 3(4) + 3 = \\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome when written in both base 2 and 4, we can start by testing palindromic numbers in base 4.\n\nIn base 4, the first palindromic number greater than 5 is 11. Converting it to base 2, we get 101, which is not a palindrome. \n\nThe next base-4 palindromic number is 22. Converting it to base 2, we get 1010, which is not a palindrome.\n\nThe next base-4 palindromic number is 33. Converting it to base 2, we get 11111. Since 11111 is a palindrome, 33 is the smallest base-4 palindromic number that is also a palindrome in base 2.\n\nConverting 33 in base 4 to base 10, we get 3*4^1 + 3*4^0 = 12 + 3 = 15.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{15}$."
