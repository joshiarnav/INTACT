    "solution": "By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768 - 1729) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 39).\n\\end{align*}Since the sum of the digits of $1729$ is $19$, which is not divisible by $3$, it suffices to check whether or not $1729$ is divisible by $13$. We can find that it is by long division or noting that $12+1 = \\boxed{13}$ divides into $1729 = 12^3 + 1^3$ using the sum of cubes factorization.",

    "model_solution": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1729 and 1768, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. \n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Divide 1768 by 1729: 1768 = 1 * 1729 + 39\n2. Divide 1729 by 39: 1729 = 44 * 39 + 13\n3. Divide 39 by 13: 39 = 3 * 13 + 0\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the last non-zero remainder (13) is the GCD of 1729 and 1768.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of $1729$ and $1768$ is $\\boxed{13}$."
