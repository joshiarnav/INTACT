    "problem": "What is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$?",
    "solution": "Observing that $4 \\cdot 7 = 28 = 27 + 1,$ we multiply both sides of the given congruence by 7 to find $28x \\equiv 91 \\pmod{27}$. Since $28x\\equiv x\\pmod{27}$ and $91\\equiv10 \\pmod{27}$, we conclude that $x\\equiv 10\\pmod{27}$. Therefore, $\\boxed{10}$ is the smallest positive integer satisfying the given congruence.",

    "model_solution": "To solve the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$, we need to find an integer $x$ that satisfies this equation.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the congruence by noticing that $4^{-1} \\equiv 7$ modulo 27. To find this inverse, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm or simply notice that $4 \\cdot 7 = 28 = 27 + 1$.\n\nNow, multiply both sides of the congruence by 7: \n$4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$\n$7 \\cdot 4x \\equiv 7 \\cdot 13 \\pmod{27}$\n$28x \\equiv 91 \\pmod{27}$\n$x \\equiv 91 \\pmod{27}$\n\nTo simplify this, we can divide 91 by 27 to get the remainder:\n$91 = 27 \\cdot 3 + 10$\nSo, $91 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{27}$.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the congruence is $x \\equiv 10 \\pmod{27}$.\n\nHowever, since you asked for the smallest positive integer, we take the smallest non-negative residue, which is 10. Therefore, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence is:\n\n$\\boxed{10}$"
