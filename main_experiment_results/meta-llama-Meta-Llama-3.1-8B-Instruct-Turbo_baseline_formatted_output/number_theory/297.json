    "problem": "When $555_{10}$ is expressed in this base, it has 4 digits, in the form ABAB, where A and B are two different digits.  What base is it?",
    "solution": "First, let us find which bases result in $555_{10}$ having four digits. We must find base b such that $b^{4}>555_{10}\\geq b^{3}$. We easily determine that b can range from 5 to 8, inclusive.  We can now try each of these four bases to see which yields a number in the form ABAB.  For base six, we find that $6^{3}=216$, which can go into 555 only two times at most, leaving $555-2\\cdot216 = 123$ for the next three digits. $6^{2}=36$ goes into 123 three times at most, leaving us with $123-3\\cdot36 = 15$. Then, $6^{1}=6$ goes into 15 two times at most, leaving $15-2\\cdot6 = 3$ for the ones digit. So, the base $\\boxed{6}$ equivalent of $555_{10}$ is $2323_{6}$, which satisfies all of the requirements stated.",

    "model_solution": "To find the base, we need to find the smallest base in which $555_{10}$ has 4 digits in the form ABAB. \n\nWe start by finding the range in which the base can lie.  We know that $b^3 \\leq 555_{10} < b^4$ for a base b with 4 digits. \n\nWe can start by trying the lower limit, $4^3 = 64$, which is less than $555_{10}$.  Then, we try the upper limit, $5^3 = 125$.  Since $5^3 < 555_{10} < 5^4$, the base must be 5 or greater.\n\nNow, we try the next power of 5, $5^4 = 625$, which is greater than $555_{10}$.  Therefore, the base must be 5.\n\nTo verify that the base is indeed 5, we convert $555_{10}$ to base 5.  We find that $555_{10} = 4200_5$, which does not have 4 digits in the form ABAB.  However, if we try the next lower base, $4^3 = 64$ to $4^4 = 256$.  Since 4 less than $555_{10}$ less than 5^4  as we have proven earlier, we need to calculate  $5^3$ (125)  to $4^3$ (64), we will come to know that we can take 5 as less than 555 but we have  less than 5^4 but  we found 555$ is greater than $4^3$ and less than $4^4$.  Therefore, we calculate $4^4$.  Therefore, we know that less than $4^4$ we have 555 less than $4^4$ less than $5^3$. Now we will go to 555 in base 6. $555_{10} = 2323_6$, which has 4 digits in the form ABAB.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{6}$ is the correct base in which $555_{10}$ has 4 digits in the form ABAB."
