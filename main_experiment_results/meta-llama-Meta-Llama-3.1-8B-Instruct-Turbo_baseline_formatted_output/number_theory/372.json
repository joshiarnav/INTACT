    "problem": "A positive five-digit integer is in the form $AB,CBA$; where $A$, $B$ and $C$ are each distinct digits. What is the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven?",
    "solution": "We can test an integer for divisibility by $11$ by alternately adding and subtracting its digits.  For example, $8162$ is divisible by 11 because $8-1+6-2=11$ is divisible by 11.  In this case, $2A-2B+C$ must be divisible by 11.  If there are satisfactory values of $B$ and $C$ corresponding to $A=9$, then the resulting integer would be larger than any integer with $A<9$.  Therefore, we try $A=9$ first.  If $A=9$, then $C-2B+18$ must be divisible by $11$.  Equivalently, $C-2B$ equals $-7$ or $4$, which implies $C=2B-7$ or $C=2B+4$.  Wanting to make $B$ as large as possible, we try $B=9,8,7,\\ldots$. $B$ cannot be $9$ because $A$, $B$, and $C$ must be distinct.  If $B=8$, then $C=9$, so again the digits are not distinct.  If $B=7$, then $C=7$ and still the digits are not distinct.  If $B=6$, then $C=5$, and $AB,\\!CBA=\\boxed{96,\\!569}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven, we need to find the greatest possible value of $A$, $B$, and $C$ such that the alternating sum of the digits is divisible by 11.\n\nLet's first consider the possible values of $A$. Since $AB,CBA$ is a five-digit integer, the value of $A$ cannot be 0. Also, since $AB,CBA$ is a positive integer, the value of $A$ cannot be negative.\n\nLet's consider the possible values of $A$ from 9 to 1. \n\nIf $A=9$, then the alternating sum of the digits is $9-B+C-B = 9-C-2B$. Since this must be divisible by 11, we have $9-C-2B \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. We also know that the digits $B$ and $C$ must be distinct and that $B$, $C$, and $A=9$ must be distinct. However, this is not possible, since 9, B, and C must be distinct, 9-B-2C  must be 0 mod 11, and when B is 8, C can't be 1, C can be 6 or 7, or 4 and 2 but 9 - 8  - 2C =0 mod 11,  C can't be  4, because 2C = 8. Similarly, this is not possible for B = 7 and C = 6, because 9 - 7 - 2*6 = -14. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 7 and C = 8, because 9 - 7 - 2*8 = -14,  C can't be 8, because 2C = 16,  and 9 - 8 - 2*6 = -11, so B = 8 and C = 6, then is 98689 which is not a five-digit integer. So  A = 9 is not possible.\n\nIf $A=8$, then the alternating sum of the digits is $8-B+C-B = 8-C-2B$. Since this must be divisible by 11, we have $8-C-2B \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. We also know that the digits $B$ and $C$ must be distinct and that $B$, $C$, and $A=8$ must be distinct. Since 8 - C - 2B  must be 11k, for k an integer, when B is 7,  C can't be 0, C can be 2 or 5, or 4, and 8 - 7 - 2C = 0 mod 11,  C can't be 4 or 0, because 2C = 14,  and 2C = 0.  Similarly, it is not possible that B = 7 and C = 6, because 8 - 7 - 2*6 = -11 + 11 = 0. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 7 and C = 8, because 8 - 7 - 2*8 = -15. The possible values of B and C are (B, C) = (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 0) is not possible, because A is 8 and is greater than 0. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 6 and C = 5, because 8 - 6 - 2*5 = -8. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 6 and C = 2, because 8 - 6 - 2*2 = -6.  Similarly, it is not possible that B = 6 and C = 0, because A is 8 and is greater than 0. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 5 and C = 4, because 8 - 5 - 2*4 = -6. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 5 and C = 2, because 8 - 5 - 2*2 = -6. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 5 and C = 0, because A is 8 and is greater than 0.  Similarly, it is not possible that B = 4 and C = 3, because 8 - 4 - 2*3 = -6.  Similarly, it is not possible that B = 4 and C = 1, because 8 - 4 - 2*1 = -6. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 4 and C = 0, because A is 8 and is greater than 0. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 3 and C = 2, because 8 - 3 - 2*2 = -4. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 3 and C = 0, because A is 8 and is greater than 0. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 2 and C = 1, because 8 - 2 - 2*1 = 4. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 2 and C = 0, because A B and C must be distinct, and A is 8 and is greater than 0. So, A = 8 and B = 7 and C = 2, then is 87982 which is not a five-digit integer. So A = 8 is not possible.\n\nIf $A=7$, then the alternating sum of the digits is $7-B+C-B = 7-C-2B$. Since this must be divisible by 11, we have $7-C-2B \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. We also know that the digits $B$ and $C$ must be distinct and that $B$, $C$, and $A=7$ must be distinct. Since 7 - C - 2B  must be 11k, for k an integer, when B is 6,  C can't be 0, C can be 3, 5, 2, or 1, and 7 - 6 - 2C = 0 mod 11,  C can't be 5, because 2C = 10,  and 7 - 6 - 2*3 = -11 + 11 = 0. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 6 and C = 2, because 2C = 4. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 6 and C = 1, because 2C = 2. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 6 and C = 0, because A is 7 and is greater than 0. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 5 and C = 4, because 7 - 5 - 2*4 = -11 + 11 = 0. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 5 and C = 2, because 7 - 5 - 2*2 = -7. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 5 and C = 1, because 7 - 5 - 2*1 = -7. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 5 and C = 0, because A is 7 and is greater than 0. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 4 and C = 3, because 7 - 4 - 2*3 = -8. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 4 and C = 1, because 7 - 4 - 2*1 = -6. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 4 and C = 0, because A is 7 and is greater than 0. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 3 and C = 2, because 7 - 3 - 2*2 = -5. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 3 and C = 1, because 7 - 3 - 2*1 = -3. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 3 and C = 0, because A is 7 and is greater than 0. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 2 and C = 1, because 7 - 2 - 2*1 = 1. Similarly, it is not possible that B = 2 and C = 0, because A is 7 and is greater than 0. So, A = 7 and B = 6 and C = 3, then is 76363 which is not a five-digit integer. So A = 7 is not possible.\n\nIf $A=6$, then the alternating sum of the digits is $6-B+C-B = 6-C-2B$. Since this must be divisible by 11, we have $6-C-2B \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. We also know that the digits $B$ and $C$ must be distinct and that $B$, $C$, and $A=6$ must be distinct. Since 6 - C - 2B  must be 11k, for k an integer, when B is 5,  C can't be 0, C can be 2, 4, 1, or 5, and 6 - 5 - 2C = 0 mod 11,  C can't be"
