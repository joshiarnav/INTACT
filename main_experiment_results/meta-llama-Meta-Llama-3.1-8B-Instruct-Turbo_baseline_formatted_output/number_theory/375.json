    "problem": "How many even divisors does $7!$ have?",
    "solution": "By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, we may count the number of even divisors of $7!$ by counting the number of ways to form the prime factorization of an even divisor of $7!$.  Suppose that $7!$ is divisible by an even positive integer $r$.  Since the prime factorization of $7!$ is $7\\cdot(2\\cdot3)\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\cdot2)\\cdot3\\cdot2=2^4\\cdot3^2\\cdot5\\cdot7$, the prime factorization of $r$ does not include any primes other than $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$.  Express $r$ in terms of its prime factorization as $2^a3^b5^c7^d$.  Then $7!/r=2^{4-a}3^{2-b}5^{1-c}7^{1-d}$.  Since $7!/r$ is an integer, $d$ must equal $0$ or $1$, $c$ must equal $0$ or $1$, and $b$ must equal $0$, $1$ or $2$.  Finally, $a$ may be no larger than $4$, but it must be at least $1$ since $r$ is even.  Altogether there are $2\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=48$ total possibilities for the four exponents $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, and hence $\\boxed{48}$ even divisors.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of even divisors of $7!$ (7 factorial), let's first calculate $7!$. The prime factorization of $7!$ is:\n\n$$\n7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7\n$$\n\nFor a divisor of $7!$ to be even, it must have at least one factor of 2. So, let's consider the powers of 2. Since the power of 2 in the prime factorization of $7!$ is 4, the power of 2 in the prime factorization of any even divisor of $7!$ can range from 1 to 4.\n\nNow, let's use the fundamental theorem of arithmetic to count the number of even divisors. Any even divisor of $7!$ can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n2^a \\times 3^b \\times 5^c \\times 7^d\n$$\n\nwhere $a$ can range from 1 to 4, and $b, c,$ and $d$ can range from 0 to the corresponding exponents in the prime factorization of $7!$.\n\nSince $a$ has 4 choices, and $b, c,$ and $d$ each have 3 choices (corresponding to 0, 1, and 2), the total number of even divisors is:\n\n$$\n4 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = \\boxed{108}\n$$"
