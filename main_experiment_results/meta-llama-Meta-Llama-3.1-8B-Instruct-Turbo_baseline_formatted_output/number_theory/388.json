    "problem": "What is the sum of the tens digit and the units digit in the decimal representation of $9^{2004}$?",
    "solution": "Write $9$ as $10-1$ and consider raising 9 to the 2004 power by multiplying out the expression \\[\n\\overbrace{(10-1)(10-1)(10-1)\\cdots(10-1)}^{2004\\text{ factors}}\n\\] There will be $2^{2004}$ terms in this expansion (one for each way to choose either 10 or $-1$ for each of the 2004 factors of $(10-1)$), but most of them will not affect the tens or units digit because they will have two or more factors of 10 and therefore will be divisible by 100.  Only the 2004 terms of $-10$ which come from choosing $-1$ in 2003 of the factors and 10 in the remaining one as well as the term $(-1)^{2004}=1$ remain.  Let $N$ represent the sum of all of the terms with more than 1 factor of 10.  We have \\begin{align*}\n(10-1)^{2004}&=N+2004(-10)+1\\\\\n&= N-20,\\!040+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-40+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-39.\n\\end{align*} So $9^{2004}$ is 39 less than a multiple of 100 and therefore ends in 61.  The sum of 6 and 1 is $\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the last two digits of $9^{2004}$, we can use the trick of finding the pattern of last two digits of successive powers of 9.\n\nWe start by listing out the last two digits of successive powers of 9:\n- $9^1 = 09$\n- $9^2 = 81$\n- $9^3 = 29$\n- $9^4 = 61$\n- $9^5 = 49$\n- $9^6 = 41$\n- $9^7 = 69$\n- $9^8 = 21$\n- $9^9 = 89$\n- $9^{10} = 01$\n- $9^{11} = 09$\n- ...\n\nSince there is a pattern, and every 10th power of 9 ends in 09, we can divide the exponent 2004 by 10. This leaves a remainder of 4.\n\nThus, we have $9^{2004} = (9^{10})^{200} \\times 9^4$. Since the last two digits of $9^{10}$ are 09, we have $9^{2004} = 09 \\times (61)$. \n\nSince $09 \\times 61 = 549$, we have the last two digits as 49.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the tens digit and the units digit is $4 + 9 = 13.$\nSo the final answer is $\\boxed{13}$."
