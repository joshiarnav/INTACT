    "problem": "If $k$ and $\\ell$ are positive 4-digit integers such that $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$, what is the smallest possible value for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$?",
    "solution": "The identity $\\gcd(k,\\ell)\\cdot\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = k\\ell$ holds for all positive integers $k$ and $\\ell$. Thus, we have $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = \\frac{k\\ell}{3}.$$Also, $k$ and $\\ell$ must be 4-digit multiples of $3$, so our choices for each are $$1002,1005,1008,1011,1014,\\ldots,$$and by minimizing the product $k\\ell$, we minimize the least common multiple of $k$ and $\\ell$. However, $k$ and $\\ell$ cannot both be $1002$, since their greatest common divisor would then be $1002$ (not $3$). Setting $k=1002$ and $\\ell=1005$, we obtain $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$ as desired, and we obtain the smallest possible value for the least common multiple: \\begin{align*}\n\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[1002,1005] &= \\frac{1002\\cdot 1005}{3} \\\\\n&= 1002\\cdot 335 \\\\\n&= (1000\\cdot 335)+(2\\cdot 335)\\\\\n&= \\boxed{335{,}670}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest possible value for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$, we need to find two 4-digit multiples of 3 with the smallest possible product.\n\nSince the product of the two numbers is $k\\ell = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]\\cdot \\gcd(k,\\ell) = 3\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$, and we want to minimize the product, we can choose the two smallest 4-digit multiples of 3.\n\nThe smallest 4-digit multiple of 3 is $1002$, and the next multiple is $1005$.\n\nHowever, $1005$ is not the next multiple of 3. The next multiple of 3 is actually 1005 + 3 = 1008 but that still is not the next 4 digit multiple of 3.  It's actually  1002 + 3  = 1005 does not satisfy this, however. 1002 + 6 = 1008 is the next multiple of 3 and this is not a 4 digit multiple of 3 however 1002 + 3 = 1005 does not work but 1002 + 6 is not a 4 digit multiple of 3 but 1002 + 3 is not a 4 digit multiple of 3 either. The next 4 digit multiple of 3 after 1002 is 1005 + the next multiple of 3 which is 3 however that is not  a 4 digit number so we need to add another 3 to get the next 4 digit multiple of 3. So 1005 + 3 + 3 = 1011.  However, 1002 + 3 = 1005 does not satisfy the problem however 1002 + 3 + 3 = 1008 is not a 4 digit multiple of 3 however 1002 + 6 is not a 4 digit multiple however 1002 + 9 is not a 4 digit multiple however 1002 + 12 is 1014 which is the next 4digit multiple of 3.\n\nTherefore $\\ell = 1014.$  Then $k = 1002$, since we need to choose a 4-digit multiple of 3 with a different prime factor.\n\nTherefore $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = \\frac{k\\ell}{\\gcd(k,\\ell)} = \\frac{1002 \\cdot 1014}{3} = \\boxed{ 336604}$"
