    "problem": "Let $g(n)$ be the product of the proper positive integer divisors of $n$. (Recall that a proper divisor of $n$ is a divisor other than $n$.) For how many values of $n$ does $n$ not divide $g(n)$, given that $2 \\le n \\le 50$?",
    "solution": "If $n$ is prime, then $g(n) = 1$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. The primes less than or equal to $50$ are $$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.$$There are $15$ of these primes. Also, if $n$ is the square of a prime, then $g(n) = \\sqrt{n}$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. By looking at the list of primes we already generated, we see that there are four perfect squares of primes less than $50$. If $n$ is any other composite integer, then it can be decomposed into the product of integers $a$ and $b$ with both integers greater than $1$. We have that $ab$ divides $g(n)$ (since $g(n)$ is the product of a collection of integers including $a$ and $b$). Since $ab=n$, this implies that $n$ divides $g(n)$. As a result, there are $15 + 4 = \\boxed{19}$ values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$, we must first identify the types of numbers for which this is true.\n\n1. Prime numbers: For prime numbers $p$, $g(p) = 1$. Hence, $p$ cannot divide $g(p)$.\n\n2. Perfect squares of prime numbers: For perfect squares of prime numbers $p^2$, $g(p^2) = 1$. Hence, $p^2$ cannot divide $g(p^2)$.\n\n3. Any number $n$ such that $n = p_1^a \\cdot p_2^b \\cdots p_k^c$ and the greatest common divisor of any two distinct primes $p_i$ and $p_j$ is greater than 1. For such numbers, $g(n)$ will be a product of numbers that are not multiples of $n$, hence $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$.\n\nNow we can identify the values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$:\n\n1. Prime numbers: The prime numbers less than or equal to 50 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47. There are 15 prime numbers in this range.\n\n2. Perfect squares of prime numbers: The perfect squares of prime numbers less than or equal to 50 are 4, 9, 25, 49. There are 4 perfect squares of prime numbers in this range.\n\n3. Any number $n$ such that $n = p_1^a \\cdot p_2^b \\cdots p_k^c$ and the greatest common divisor of any two distinct primes $p_i$ and $p_j$ is greater than 1. The only numbers in this range that satisfy this condition are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 44, 45, 46, 50, and 51 is not in the given range so we exclude it. However, 51 is not in the range but 8, 25, and 49 were already counted so we have to exclude them.\n\nCombining these results, we have that the numbers for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$ are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 49, and 50. However, the 4 perfect squares of prime numbers (4, 9, 25, 49) and the 8 numbers that were excluded (8, 25, 49,  and 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, and 18) were counted multiple times, so we have to subtract 4 (the perfect squares of prime numbers) and 12 (the 8 numbers that were excluded in the previous step  plus the 4 numbers that were duplicates) from the total count.\n\nTherefore, the total number of values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$ is 40 - 4 - 12 = 24."
