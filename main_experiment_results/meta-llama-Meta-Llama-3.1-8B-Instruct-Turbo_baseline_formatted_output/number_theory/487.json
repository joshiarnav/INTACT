    "model_solution": "To find the value of $x^2 \\pmod{20}$, we first need to find the value of $x \\pmod{20}$.\n\nGiven $4x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{20}$, we can simplify this equation to make it easier to solve:\n\n1. Divide both sides by 4:\n   $x \\equiv 8/4 \\pmod{20/4}$ or $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n\n2. Now given $3x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{20}$, we need to find the value of $x$ that satisfies both equations. We can reduce the second equation by finding the value of $x$ modulo 5 that is equivalent to 3x modulo 20. \n\n   1. Multiply both sides of the first equation by 3:\n      $3x \\equiv 3(2)\\pmod{5}$ or $3x \\equiv 6 \\pmod{5}$.\n\n   2. Since $3x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{20}$, $3x \\equiv 6 \\pmod{5}$.\n\n   3. Therefore, we can say $16 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{5}$.\n\n   4. We can add $10$ to the right-hand side of the equation (because $10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$):\n      $16 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{5}$.\n\n   5. Therefore, the equations $3x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{20}$ and $3x \\equiv 6 \\pmod{5}$ are equivalent.\n\n   6. Now, reduce the second equation by finding the value of $x$ modulo 5:\n      $3x \\equiv 6 \\pmod{5}$ or $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n\n   7. Therefore, the only solution to this system of linear congruences modulo 20 is:\n      $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n\n   8. We have two equations that are equivalent modulo 5:\n      $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$ and $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n\n   9. Therefore, $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n\n   10. Since the original system is modulo 20, but we have only one congruence modulo 5, we can try to find the value of $x$ modulo 20 that satisfies this congruence.\n\n   11. Since $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$, we can say $x = 2 + 5n$, where n is an integer.\n\n   12. Therefore, to find the value of $x \\pmod{20}$, we need to find the value of $5n \\pmod{20}$ that makes $2 + 5n \\equiv x \\pmod{20}$.\n\n   13. Since $5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{20}$, we can multiply both sides of the congruence $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$ by 4:\n      $4x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{20}$.\n\n   14. Therefore, the only solution to this system of linear congruences modulo 20 is:\n      $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{20}$.\n\n   15. Therefore, $x^2 \\pmod{20}$ is equivalent to $2^2 \\pmod{20}$.\n\n   16. Therefore, the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by 20 is 4.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{4}$."
