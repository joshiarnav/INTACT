    "problem": "When three positive integers are divided by $24$, the remainders are $10,$ $4,$ and $12,$ respectively.\n\nWhen the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, what is the remainder?",
    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 10\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 12\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 10+4+12 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $24$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, we can represent the three integers as $24a+10$, $24b+4$, and $24c+12$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are non-negative integers.\n\nThe sum of the three integers is $(24a+10) + (24b+4) + (24c+12) = 24a + 24b + 24c + 26$.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get $24(a+b+c) + 26$.\n\nSince $24(a+b+c)$ is a multiple of $24$, when we divide $24(a+b+c) + 26$ by $24$, the remainder will be the same as when $26$ is divided by $24$.\n\nTo find the remainder, we can divide $26$ by $24$. The quotient is $1$ with a remainder of $2$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$ is $\\boxed{2}$."
