    "problem": "Find the smallest positive integer whose cube ends in $888$.\n",
    "solution": "$n^3 \\equiv 888 \\pmod{1000} \\implies n^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ and $n^3 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125}$. $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$ due to the last digit of $n^3$. Let $n = 5a + 2$. By expanding, $125a^3 + 150a^2 + 60a + 8 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125} \\implies 5a^2 + 12a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$.\nBy looking at the last digit again, we see $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod5$, so we let $a = 5a_1 + 3$ where $a_1 \\in \\mathbb{Z^+}$. Plugging this in to $5a^2 + 12a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$ gives $10a_1 + 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$. Obviously, $a_1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$, so we let $a_1 = 5a_2 + 2$ where $a_2$ can be any non-negative integer.\nTherefore, $n = 2 + 5(3+ 5(2+5a_2)) = 125a_2 + 67$. $n^3$ must also be a multiple of $8$, so $n$ must be even. $125a_2 + 67 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2 \\implies a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Therefore, $a_2 = 2a_3 + 1$, where $a_3$ is any non-negative integer. The number $n$ has form $125(2a_3+1)+67 = 250a_3+192$. So the minimum $n = \\boxed{192}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest positive integer whose cube ends in $888$, we need to find an integer $n$ such that $n^3$ ends in $888$.\n\nFirst, let's consider the last digit of the cube. To do this, we need to find the last digit of $n^3$. We can do this by finding the last digit of powers of $1, 2, 3, ...$ and then finding the pattern.\n\nThe last digit of powers of $1, 2, 3, ...$ are:\n\n$1^1$ = 1 \n$2^1$ = 2 \n$3^1$ = 3 \n$4^1$ = 4 \n$5^1$ = 5 \n$6^1$ = 6 \n$7^1$ = 7 \n$8^1$ = 8 \n$9^1$ = 9 \n$10^1$ = 0 \n\n$1^2$ = 1 \n$2^2$ = 4 \n$3^2$ = 9 \n$4^2$ = 6 \n$5^2$ = 5 \n$6^2$ = 6 \n$7^2$ = 9 \n$8^2$ = 4 \n$9^2$ = 1 \n$10^2$ = 0 \n\n$1^3$ = 1 \n$2^3$ = 8 \n$3^3$ = 7 \n$4^3$ = 4 \n$5^3$ = 5 \n$6^3$ = 6 \n$7^3$ = 3 \n$8^3$ = 2 \n$9^3$ = 9 \n$10^3$ = 0 \n\nFrom this pattern, we can see that the last digit of $n^3$ is the same as the last digit of $n$. Therefore, the last digit of $n$ must be $8$.\n\nNext, let's consider the last two digits of the cube. To do this, we need to find the last two digits of powers of $8$. Since the last two digits of $8^2$ are $44$, the last two digits of $8^3$ will be $888$. \n\nNow, we can find the smallest positive integer whose cube ends in $888$. To do this, we can start with $8$ and keep multiplying by $8$ until we find the smallest number whose cube ends in $888$. \n\nThe first few powers of $8$ are:\n\n$8^1$ = 8 \n$8^2$ = 64 \n$8^3$ = 512 \n$8^4$ = 4096 \n$8^5$ = 32768 \n$8^6$ = 262144 \n$8^7$ = 2097152 \n$8^8$ = 16777216 \n\nThe cube of $8$ is $8^3 = 512$, which does not end in $888$. However, the cube of $72$ is $72^3 = 373248$, which does not end in $888$ either. But the cube of $92$ is $92^3 = 7778888$ and the cube of $72^2 + 16$ is $72^2*16 + 16^3$ which is not $888$ but the cube of  $72^2 + 32$ or  $72^2 + 64$ is also not $888$. We can also check the cube of $72 + 16$ but this is also not $888$.\n\nHowever, if we check the last three digits of the cube of $72 + 64$ we get the cube of  $136$ is $136^3 =  222,662,432$ which also doesn't end in $888$. So, let's check $72 + 96$. The cube of  $168$ is $168^3 =  39,955,904$ which also doesn't end in $888$. Now let's check $72 + 112$.

The cube of  $216$ is $216^3 =  11,905,273,728$ which also doesn't end in $888$. Thus, let's check $72 + 160$. The cube of  $232$ is $232^3 =  9,425,899,712$ which also doesn't end in $888$.
