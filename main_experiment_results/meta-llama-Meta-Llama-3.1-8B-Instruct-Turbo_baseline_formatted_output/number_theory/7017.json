Since the first (leftmost) digit of a number is determined by the first few digits, we can ignore the last few digits of $9^k$ when determining the leftmost digit. \n\nGiven that $9^{4000}$ has 3817 digits, we can assume that the first 3816 digits of $9^{4000}$ are the same as the first 3816 digits of $9^{3816}$. \n\nHowever, we must consider that the first (leftmost) digit of $9^k$ for $3817 \\le k \\le 4000$ could be different from the first (leftmost) digit of $9^{3816}$. \n\nTo find the number of elements with 9 as their leftmost digit, we need to consider the elements with fewer than 3817 digits, which is $4000 - 3817 = 183$, and the number of elements with 3817 digits that start with 9.\n\nThe first (leftmost) digit of a number is determined by the first few digits, so we can ignore the last few digits of $9^k$ when determining the leftmost digit. \n\nSince the first (leftmost) digit of a number in the form $9^k$ is 9 for $k = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 3816$, and the first (leftmost) digit of $9^k$ for $3817 \\le k \\le 4000$ is determined by the first few digits of $9^{3816}$, we must consider the number of elements in the form $9^k$ where $3817 \\le k \\le 4000$ that start with 9.\n\nHowever, we do not need to calculate the exact number of such elements.
