    "problem": "A solid rectangular block is formed by gluing together $N$ congruent 1-cm cubes face to face. When the block is viewed so that three of its faces are visible, exactly $231$ of the 1-cm cubes cannot be seen. Find the smallest possible value of $N.$\n",
    "solution": "The $231$ cubes which are not visible must lie below exactly one layer of cubes. Thus, they form a rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension. If the original block has dimensions $l \\times m \\times n$, we must have $(l - 1)\\times(m-1) \\times(n - 1) = 231$. The prime factorization of $231 = 3\\cdot7\\cdot11$, so we have a variety of possibilities; for instance, $l - 1 = 1$ and $m - 1 = 11$ and $n - 1 = 3 \\cdot 7$, among others. However, it should be fairly clear that the way to minimize $l\\cdot m\\cdot n$ is to make $l$ and $m$ and $n$ as close together as possible, which occurs when the smaller block is $3 \\times 7 \\times 11$. Then the extra layer makes the entire block $4\\times8\\times12$, and $N= \\boxed{384}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's consider how the solid rectangular block is structured. The $231$ cubes that cannot be seen are the ones inside the block, which are touching three faces. We need to find the dimensions of the block so that the number of these cubes is $231$.\n\nLet's express the dimensions of the block as $l\\times m\\times n$, where $l$, $m$, and $n$ are positive integers. The number of cubes touching three faces is equal to the product of the dimensions of the block, excluding the smallest dimension. This can be expressed as $(l-1)\\times(m-1)\\times(n-1)$.\n\nWe are given that $(l-1)\\times(m-1)\\times(n-1) = 231$. \n\nFirst, let's factorize $231$ into its prime factors: $231 = 3\\times7\\times11$. \n\nThe minimum possible dimensions of the block will be achieved when we have the smallest possible $l$, $m$, and $n$, such that their differences are $2$, $1$, and $0$ respectively, but this isn't an option with three factors. We would need to have two factors that are 2 less, and one factor that is 1 less. \n\nThe next possibility for $(l-1)\\times(m-1)\\times(n-1)$ is when we have two factors that are $3-1=2$ and one factor that is $11-1=10$. This combination is not possible with the factorization of 231. The next possibility is one factor that is $11-1=10$ and the other two are $3-1=2$ and $7-1=6$. \n\nUsing this, we can set the dimensions as $l = 10 + 1 = 11, m = 2 + 1 = 3,$ and $n = 6 + 1 = 7$ (or any permutation of these three values), and get $(l-1)\\times(m-1)\\times(n-1) = 10\\times 2\\times 6 = 120.$ However, this does not give us 231.\n\nWe can also consider the case when we have $l-1 = 3\\times7=21, m-1 = 11, n-1 = 1$, or any permutation of these. This gives us $(l-1)\\times(m-1)\\times(n-1) = 21\\times 11\\times 1 = 231.$ In this case, the dimensions are $l = 21 + 1 = 22, m = 11 + 1 = 12,$ and $n = 1 + 1 = 2.$\n\nNow, we can find the minimum possible value of $N$, which is the product of the dimensions of the block: $N = 22\\times 12\\times 2 = \\boxed{528}.$"
