    "model_solution": "The product of the first $100$ positive odd integers can be written as $1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdots 195 \\cdot 197 \\cdot 199.$\n\nTo find the number of threes in this product, we can use the method of counting the number of threes obtained from each prime multiple of 3 in this product. \n\nFor the first $50$ positive odd integers, the prime multiples of $3$ are $3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, 75, 81, 87, 93, 99, 105, 111, 117, 123, 129, 135, 141, 147, 153, 159, 165, 171, 177, 183, 189, 195, $ where $3$ occurs once in $3$, $9$ has two $3$s, $15$ has one $3$, and so on. So, the number of threes in the first $50$ positive odd integers is $2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26.$\n\nFor the next $50$ positive odd integers, the prime multiples of $3$ are $201, 207, 213, 219, 225, 231, 237, 243, 249, 255, 261, 267, 273, 279, 285, 291, 297, 303, 309, 315, 321, 327, 333, 339, 345, 351, 357, 363, 369, 375, 381, 387, 393, 399, $ where $3$ occurs once in $201$, $207$ has two $3$s, $213$ has one $3$, and so on. So, the number of threes in the next $50$ positive odd integers is $2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26.$\n\nThe total number of threes is $26 + 26 = 52.$\n\nTherefore, the largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k$ is $\\boxed{52}.$"
