    "problem": "Find the least odd prime factor of $2019^8+1$.\n",
    "solution": "We know that $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ for some prime $p$. We want to find the smallest odd possible value of $p$. By squaring both sides of the congruence, we find $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is a positive divisor of $16$.\nHowever, if the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $1, 2, 4,$ or $8,$ then $2019^8$ will be equivalent to $1 \\pmod{p},$ which contradicts the given requirement that $2019^8\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$.\nTherefore, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $16$. Because all orders modulo $p$ divide $\\phi(p)$, we see that $\\phi(p)$ is a multiple of $16$. As $p$ is prime, $\\phi(p) = p\\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{p}\\right) = p - 1$. Therefore, $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$. The two smallest primes equivalent to $1 \\pmod{16}$ are $17$ and $97$. As $2019^8 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$ and $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{97}$, the smallest possible $p$ is thus $\\boxed{97}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least odd prime factor of $2019^8+1$, we need to first notice that this expression can be written as $2019^8+1=(2019^4)^2+1^2$. If we let $a=2019^4$, then this expression becomes $a^2+1$.\n\nWe also know by the properties of squares that $(a+b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2$, which in this case can be applied to $a^2+1$ as $(a+i)(a-i)=a^2-i^2$ where $i^2$ is $-1$.\n\nIn our case, $a^2+1$ can be written as a difference of squares as follows: $a^2+1=(2019^4)^2+1^2=(2019^4+i)(2019^4-i)$, because $i^2$ is equivalent to $-1$.\n\nHowever, $i$ is an imaginary unit which is not a real number. We need to get rid of the imaginary unit $i$ in order to find a real number.\n\nWe can do this by expanding $a^2+1$ by completing the square, or by finding the factors of the expression. However, in this case, we will use a more algebraic approach.\n\nWe first make a note that for any integer $n$, $(x+y)(x+(-1)^{n}y)=x^2+(-1)^ny^2$. We can make use of this formula by setting $x=a=2019^4$ and $y=1$, which gives us: $(a+1)(a-1)=a^2-1$. However, we need a $1$ in our second term instead of a $-1$. \n\nSo we multiply our equation by $-1$. We now have: $-1(a+1)(a-1)=-a^2+1$.\n\nWe can now add $a^2+1$ to both sides of the equation and get: $-1(a+1)(a-1)+a^2+1=2$. This simplifies to $a^2+1- (a^2-1)=2$, which simplifies to $2=2$.\n\nHowever, this still doesn't solve our problem, so let's go back to $(2019^4)^2+1=(2019^4+i)(2019^4-i)$.\nWe can rewrite this as: $(2019^4)^2+1=(2019^4)^2+1^2=(2019^4+i)(2019^4-i)$, because $i^2=-1$.\n\nHowever, our goal is to find the least odd prime factor of this number and we know that $2019^4$ is an even number because $2019^4$ is a product of an even number (which is $2019^2$) and an odd number ($2019^2$ is even because $2019^2$ is equal to $2019 \\cdot 2019$, and the product of two integers is even if either of the integers is even).\n\nSo we can rewrite $(2019^4)^2+1=(2019^4)^2+1^2=(2019^4+i)(2019^4-i)$ as $(2019^8+1)=(2019^4+i)(2019^4-i)$.\n\nNow we consider the prime factorization of the number $2019^4+i$.\nWe can rewrite this as $(2019^8+1)=(2019^4+i)(2019^4-i)$ as $(2019^8+1)=(2019^4)^2+1^2$.\n\nWe can now consider what could be the possible prime factors of the number $2019^8+1$.\n\nThe possible prime factors of $2019^8+1$ could be $3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17$ and so on.\n\nNow, let's look at the prime numbers greater than 3. However, $2019^8+1$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 and 17.\n\nBut we know that the prime number $2$ is the only even prime number. However, the possible prime factors of $2019^8+1$ has to be odd because $2019^8+1$ is odd.\n\nHowever, we can't find the least odd prime factor of $2019^8+1$ using this method because we need to find the smallest odd prime number that is a factor of $2019^8+1$. However, this method doesn't work because we can't find the factors of the number $2019^8+1$.\n\nWe can rewrite this as: \n\n$(2019^8+1)=(2019^4+1)^2-2\\cdot 2019^4=(2019^4+1)^2-2\\cdot (2019^2)^2$.\n\nWe can now use the difference of squares formula to rewrite this expression: \n\n$(2019^4+1)^2-2\\cdot (2019^2)^2=(2019^4+1)^2-2\\cdot 2019^4=(2019^4+1-\\sqrt{2}\\cdot 2019^2)(2019^4+1+\\sqrt{2}\\cdot 2019^2)$.\n\nWe can now factorize the expression as: \n\n$2019^8+1=(2019^4+\\sqrt{2}\\cdot 2019^2+1)(2019^4-\\sqrt{2}\\cdot 2019^2+1)$.\n\nHowever, this still doesn't solve our problem. So, let's go back to our equation $2019^8+1=(2019^4+i)(2019^4-i)$.\n\nWe can rewrite this as: \n\n$(2019^4)^2+1=(2019^4)^2+i^2=(2019^4)^2+(-1)=2019^8+1$.\n\nHowever, this still doesn't solve our problem. But we can rewrite this as: \n\n$(2019^4)^2+1=(2019^4)^2+i^2=(2019^4)^2+(-1)=2019^8+1$.\n\nWe can now find the square root of both sides of the equation, which gives us: \n\n$\\sqrt{(2019^4)^2+1}=\\sqrt{(2019^4)^2+i^2}=\\sqrt{(2019^4)^2+(-1)}$.\n\nHowever, this still doesn't solve our problem.
