    "solution": "Taking inspiration from $4^4 \\mid 10^{10}$ we are inspired to take $n$ to be $p^2$, the lowest prime not dividing $210$, or $11 \\implies n = 121$. Now, there are $242$ factors of $11$, so $11^{242} \\mid m^m$, and then $m = 11k$ for $k \\geq 22$. Now, $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = \\gcd(11+k,210) = 1$. Noting $k = 26$ is the minimal that satisfies this, we get $(n,m) = (121,286)$. Thus, it is easy to verify this is minimal and we get $\\boxed{407}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the least possible value of $m + n$ given the conditions.\n\nFirst, let's work with the condition $\\gcd(m + n, 210) = 1$. This implies that the sum of $m$ and $n$ shares no common factors with $210 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7$. \n\nNext, the condition $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$ can be rewritten as $m^m \\ge n^n$. \n\nTo minimize the sum $m + n$, we should try to find a value of $m$ such that it is as close to being a multiple of $n$ as possible, but not a multiple of $n$. \n\nIf we let $n = k^a \\cdot x^n$ where $x$ is not divisible by $k$, the least $m$ would be $k \\cdot r \\cdot x^m$ with $m < n$ and $r$ is a positive integer, $r > 1$. This would minimize the $m + n$. However this does not work because if $m < n$, then $m^m < n^n$ which contradicts the given condition.\n\nIf $m = kn$ then $m^m$ would be a multiple of $n^n$ for any $k$. However, then $m + n$ would share a factor with $210$ because $n$ would be divisible by $2$ or $3$ or $5$ or $7$. This contradicts the first condition.\n\nThis suggests that we should try to let $m$ be of the form $kn + r$ where $r < n$ and $r$ is not divisible by $k$. Then $m^m$ would be a multiple of $n^n$ because $n^n = (kn+r)^n$ will have a factor of $n^n$ because there are at least $n$ factors of $r$ in it. To minimize $m + n$, we need to minimize $kn + r$. To ensure that $m + n$ does not share a factor with $210$, we should try to let $k$ be $2$, $3$, $5$, or $7$. Let us test each case.\n\nIf $k = 5$, then $n = 5^a$ and $m = 5^a r + 5^b$. Then $r$ must be $2$ or $3$ to minimize $m$. But $r = 2$ would give $m = 5^a \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 5^b$, which is divisible by $5$. Hence this case is impossible.\n\nIf $k = 7$, then $n = 7^a$ and $m = 7^a r + 7^b$. Then $r$ must be $2$ or $3$ to minimize $m$. But $r = 2$ would give $m = 7^a \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 7^b$, which is divisible by $7$. Hence this case is impossible.\n\nIf $k = 2$, then $n = 2^a$ and $m = 2^a r + 2^b$. Then $r$ must be $3$ to minimize $m$. Then $m = 2^a \\cdot 3 + 2^b$.\n\nIf $k = 3$, then $n = 3^a$ and $m = 3^a r + 3^b$. Then $r$ must be $2$ to minimize $m$. Then $m = 3^a \\cdot 2 + 3^b$.\n\nTesting the least values of $a$ and $b$ that will fit the given conditions, we find that $a = 4$ and $b = 3$ work for both cases.\n\nIf $k = 2$, then $n = 2^a = 16$, and $m = 2^a r + 2^b = 3 \\cdot 16 + 8 = 56$. Then $m + n = 56 + 16 = 72$.\n\nIf $k = 3$, then $n = 3^a = 81$, and $m = 3^a r + 3^b = 2 \\cdot 81 + 27 = 189$. Then $m + n = 189 + 81 = 270$.\n\nWe see that $72 < 270$, hence the least possible value of $m + n$ is $\\boxed{72}$."
