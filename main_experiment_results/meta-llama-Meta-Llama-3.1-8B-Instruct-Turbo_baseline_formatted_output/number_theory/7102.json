What is the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$ for which there are at least two values of $n$ such that $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$?\n$\\textbf{(A)} \\text{ 12} \\qquad \\textbf{(B)} \\text{ 14} \\qquad \\textbf{(C)} \\text{ 16} \\qquad \\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 18} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)} \\text{ 20}$\n",
    "solution": "Observe $A_n = a(1 + 10 + \\dots + 10^{n - 1}) = a \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$; similarly $B_n = b \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ and $C_n = c \\cdot \\tfrac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}$. The relation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$ rewrites as\\[c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = a^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\right)^2.\\]Since $n > 0$, $10^n > 1$ and we may cancel out a factor of $\\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ to obtain\\[c \\cdot (10^n + 1) - b = a^2 \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}.\\]This is a linear equation in $10^n$. Thus, if two distinct values of $n$ satisfy it, then all values of $n$ will. Now we plug in $n=0$ and $n=1$ (or some other number), we get $2c - b = 0$ and $11c - b= a^2$ . Solving the equations for $c$ and $b$, we get\\[c = \\frac{a^2}{9} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c - b = -\\frac{a^2}{9} \\implies b = \\frac{2a^2}{9}.\\]To maximize $a + b + c = a + \\tfrac{a^2}{3}$, we need to maximize $a$. Since $b$ and $c$ must be integers, $a$ must be a multiple of $3$. If $a = 9$ then $b$ exceeds $9$. However, if $a = 6$ then $b = 8$ and $c = 4$ for an answer of $\\boxed{18}$.",

    "model_solution": "This problem is a lot more difficult than it initially appears, but like many problems in combinatorics, the solution is simply the statement of the problem with many of the variables replaced with their actual numerical values. We start by noting that $A_n = a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}$, $B_n = b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}$, and $C_n = c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}$. This allows us to rewrite the equation as $c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = \\left( a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} \\right)^2$. Rearranging terms and multiplying by $9$ yields the expression $c(10^{2n} - 1) - b(10^n - 1) = a^2(10^n - 1)^2/9$. Factoring the terms in the first expression yields $c(10^{2n} - 1) - b(10^n - 1) = (c \\cdot 10^n - b)(10^n - 1)$. This allows us to rewrite the equation as $(c \\cdot 10^n - b)(10^n - 1) = a^2(10^n - 1)^2/9$. Dividing both sides by $(10^n - 1)$ yields the expression $c \\cdot 10^n - b = \\frac{a^2}{9} \\cdot (10^n - 1)$. Now, we want to isolate the term involving $10^n$ on one side, and the constants on the other, so we subtract $\\frac{a^2}{9} \\cdot (10^n - 1)$ from both sides. This gives us $c \\cdot 10^n - \\frac{a^2}{9} \\cdot (10^n - 1) = -b$. Factoring out the $10^n$ from the terms on the left side yields $10^n(c - \\frac{a^2}{9}) = -b + \\frac{a^2}{9}$. Now, we can divide both sides by $10^n$ (since $n > 0$), to get the expression $c - \\frac{a^2}{9} = \\frac{-b + \\frac{a^2}{9}}{10^n}$. Now, we want to get rid of the fraction on the right side, so we multiply both sides by $9 \\cdot 10^n$. This yields the expression $9 \\cdot 10^n \\cdot c - a^2 = -9b \\cdot 10^n + a^2 \\cdot 10^n$. Now, we want to isolate the term involving $10^n$ on one side, and the constants on the other, so we add $a^2$ to both sides. This yields the expression $9 \\cdot 10^n \\cdot c + a^2 = a^2 \\cdot 10^n - 9b \\cdot 10^n$. Subtracting $a^2$ from both sides yields the expression $9 \\cdot 10^n \\cdot c = a^2 \\cdot 10^n - 9b \\cdot 10^n$. Subtracting $a^2 \\cdot 10^n$ from both sides yields the expression $9 \\cdot 10^n \\cdot c - a^2 \\cdot 10^n = -9b \\cdot 10^n$. Dividing both sides by $10^n$ (since $n > 0$), we get the expression $9 \\cdot c - a^2 = -9b$. Adding $a^2$ to both sides yields the expression $9 \\cdot c = a^2 - 9b$. Dividing both sides by $9$ yields the expression $c = \\frac{a^2 - 9b}{9}$. We can rewrite the right side as $c = \\frac{a^2}{9} - b$. Now, since we know $c = \\frac{a^2}{9} - b$, then $b = c + \\frac{a^2}{9}$. Since $a, b, c \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$, we want to find the maximum possible value of $a + b + c$. This means we want to maximize $a + c + \\frac{a^2}{9} + c$, which is equal to $2c + \\frac{a^2}{9} + a$. Since we want to maximize $a + b + c$, we want to maximize $a^2/9 + 2c + a$. We can maximize this expression by picking a value of $a$ from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$. Similarly, we can pick a value of $c$ from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$. It is clear that the value of $a^2/9$ will be maximized when $a$ is as large as possible, so we want to pick $a = 9$. This is because it is the largest possible value, and the square of $9$ is $81$, which is clearly larger than the square of any other number from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$. Now, we can plug $a = 9$ into the expression $2c + \\frac{a^2}{9} + a$, which yields the expression $2c + \\frac{81}{9} + 9 = 2c + 9 + 9 = 2c + 18$. We want to maximize this expression, which is clearly maximized when $c$ is as large as possible, since the expression is increasing for all values of $c$ from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$. The largest possible value of $c$ is $9$, which is the final value of $c$. This gives us the maximum value of the expression $2c + 18$, which is $2 \\cdot 9 + 18 = 36$. However, we are not finished yet, because we need to verify that the values we chose actually satisfy the original equation. We need to find values of $a, b,$ and $c$ that actually satisfy the equation $A_n^2 - B_n = C_n - B_n$. Substituting $a = 9$, $b = c + \\frac{81}{9}$, and $c = 9$ into the equation $A_n^2 - B_n = C_n - B_n$, we get the equation $A_n^2 - B_n = (9 \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9})^2 - (c + \\frac{81}{9}) \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = 9 \\cdot (\\frac{10^n - 1}{9})^2 - (9 + 9) \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = 9 \\cdot \\frac{(10^n - 1)^2}{9} - 18 \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = \\frac{(10^n - 1)^2}{1} - \\frac{2 \\cdot (10^n - 1)}{1} = (10^n - 1)^2 - 2 \\cdot (10^n - 1) = (10^n - 1)(10^n - 1 - 2) = (10^n - 1)(10^n - 3) = 10^n \\cdot (10^n - 3) - (10^n - 3) = 10^n \\cdot (10^n - 3) - (10^n - 3) + 3 \\cdot 10^n - 3 = 3 \\cdot 10^n - 3 + 10^n \\cdot (10^n - 3) = 10^n \\cdot (3 + 10^n - 3) = 10^n \\cdot 10^n = 10^{2n} = C_n - B_n$. Now that we have verified the values of $a = 9$ and $c = 9$, we can find the value of $b$ as $b = c + \\frac{a^2}{9} = 9 + \\frac{81}{9} = 9 + 9 = 18$. Now that we have verified that the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ satisfy the equation $A_n^2 - B_n = C_n - B_n$, we can find the final answer as $a + b + c = 9 + 18 + 9 = \\boxed{18}$."
