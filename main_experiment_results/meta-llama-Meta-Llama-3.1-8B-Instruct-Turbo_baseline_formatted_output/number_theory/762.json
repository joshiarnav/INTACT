    "model_solution": "To find the units digit of $n$, we need to find the units digit of $21^6$. \n\nThe units digit of $21^1$ is 1, since $21 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$.\n\nSo, the units digit of $21^2$ is 1, since $(21)^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\pmod{10}$.\n\nSimilarly, the units digit of $21^3$ is 1, since $(21)^3 \\equiv 1^3 \\pmod{10}$.\n\nThe units digit of $21^4$ is 1, since $(21)^4 \\equiv 1^4 \\pmod{10}$.\n\nThe units digit of $21^5$ is 1, since $(21)^5 \\equiv 1^5 \\pmod{10}$.\n\nThe units digit of $21^6$ is 1, since $(21)^6 \\equiv 1^6 \\pmod{10}$.\n\nSo, $21^6$ has a units digit of 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the units digit of $n$ given that $mn = 21^6$ and $m$ has a units digit of 7. \n\nFor $mn = 21^6$, the product of $m$ and $n$ must have a units digit of 1.\n\nWe know that $m$ has a units digit of 7, so the units digit of $n$ multiplied by 7 must have a units digit of 1.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $n$ multiplied by 7 is 1, 9, or 7.\n\nWe can see that $7 \\cdot 7 = 49$, which has a units digit of 9.\n\nAlso, $7 \\cdot 9 = 63$, which has a units digit of 3.\n\nHowever, we can test $7 \\cdot 3$ to see if the units digit is 1.\n\n$7 \\cdot 3 = 21$, which has a units digit of 1.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $n$ is $\\boxed{3}$."
