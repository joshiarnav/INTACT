    "problem": "What is the value of $0.\\overline{789}-0.\\overline{456}-0.\\overline{123}?$ Express your answer as a fraction in lowest terms.",
    "solution": "We begin by finding the fractional forms of the decimals, $0.\\overline{789}$, $0.\\overline{456}$, and $0.\\overline{123}$. Let $x=0.\\overline{789}$, then $1000x=789.\\overline{789}$ and $1000x-x=789.\\overline{789}-0.789 \\implies 999x - 789$. Therefore, $0.\\overline{789}=\\frac{789}{999}$. We use the same method to find that $0.\\overline{456}=\\frac{456}{999}$ and $0.\\overline{123}=\\frac{123}{999}$.  Next, we perform the indicated operations, knowing that $0.\\overline{789}-0.\\overline{456}-0.\\overline{123}=\\frac{789}{999}-\\frac{456}{999}-\\frac{123}{999}$. This equals $\\frac{210}{999}$, which simplifies to $\\boxed{\\frac{70}{333}}$, when both the numerator and the denominator are divided by $3$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to first convert the repeating decimals into fractions.\n\nLet's start with $0.\\overline{789}$. Let $x = 0.\\overline{789}$. Multiplying both sides by $1000$ gives us $1000x = 789.\\overline{789}$. Subtracting the original equation from this gives $1000x - x = 789.\\overline{789} - 0.\\overline{789}$, which simplifies to $999x = 789$. So, $x = \\frac{789}{999} = \\frac{263}{333}$.\n\nNow, let's move on to $0.\\overline{456}$. Let $y = 0.\\overline{456}$. Multiplying both sides by $1000$ gives us $1000y = 456.\\overline{456}$. Subtracting the original equation from this gives $1000y - y = 456.\\overline{456} - 0.\\overline{456}$, which simplifies to $999y = 456$. So, $y = \\frac{456}{999}$.\n\nFinally, let's convert $0.\\overline{123}$. Let $z = 0.\\overline{123}$. Multiplying both sides by $1000$ gives us $1000z = 123.\\overline{123}$. Subtracting the original equation from this gives $1000z - z = 123.\\overline{123} - 0.\\overline{123}$, which simplifies to $999z = 123$. So, $z = \\frac{123}{999}$.\n\nNow, we can find the value of $0.\\overline{789}-0.\\overline{456}-0.\\overline{123} = \\frac{263}{333} - \\frac{456}{999} - \\frac{123}{999}$.\n\nTo add or subtract fractions, we need to have the same denominator. In this case, the least common multiple of $333$ and $999$ is $333 \\times 3 = 999$. So, we can rewrite $\\frac{263}{333}$ as $\\frac{263 \\times 3}{333 \\times 3} = \\frac{789}{999}$.\n\nNow, we can subtract: $\\frac{789}{999} - \\frac{456}{999} - \\frac{123}{999} = \\frac{789-456-123}{999} = \\frac{210}{999}$.\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $3$. So, $\\frac{210}{999} = \\frac{210 \\div 3}{999 \\div 3} = \\frac{70}{333}$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $0.\\overline{789}-0.\\overline{456}-0.\\overline{123}$ expressed as a fraction in lowest terms is $\\boxed{\\frac{70}{333}}$."
