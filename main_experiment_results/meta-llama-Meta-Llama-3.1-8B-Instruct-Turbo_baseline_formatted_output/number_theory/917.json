    "model_solution": "To find the modular inverse of 2 modulo 185, we need to find a number x such that 2x \u2261 1 (mod 185).\n\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse. The algorithm will give us the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 2 and 185, and the coefficients of B\u00e9zout's identity, which are the modular inverse and the other number.\n\nHowever, since 185 is an odd number and 2 is coprime with 185, we can easily find the modular inverse. \n\nThe modular inverse of 2 modulo 185 can be found by multiplying 2 with 93 because 2 * 93 = 186 which is 1 more than 185. \n\nTherefore, the modular inverse of 2 modulo 185 is 93.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{93}$."
