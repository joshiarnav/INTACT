    "problem": "The solution of $8x+1\\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$ is $x\\equiv a\\pmod{m}$ for some positive integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a<m$. Find $a+m$.",
    "solution": "Subtract 1 from both sides to obtain $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$. Add 12 to the right-hand side to get $8x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{12}$. Now divide both sides by 8, remembering to divide 12 by the greatest common factor of 12 and 8, thus obtaining $x \\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. This gives $a+m = 2 + 3 = \\boxed{5}$. Here we have used the fact that $ad \\equiv bd\\pmod{m}$ if and only if $a\\equiv b \\pmod{m/\\text{gcd}(m,d)}$, for integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a$, $b$, and $d$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve the congruence $8x+1\\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$, we need to isolate $x$. \n\nFirst, we subtract 1 from both sides: \n$8x+1-1\\equiv 5-1 \\pmod{12}$ \n$8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$ \n\nNext, we divide both sides by 4: \n\nSince 12 divided by 4 equals 3, we need to find the modular inverse of 3 modulo 12 or in simpler terms, a number that when 3 times it equals 1 modulo 12 is 3 times 4, so: \n\n$(8/4)x \\equiv 4/4 \\pmod{12}$\n$2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$ \n\nNow, we divide both sides by 2: \n\nSince 12 divided by 2 equals 6, we need to find the modular inverse of 6 modulo 12, however if you remember that one is equal to the modular inverse of one, then in simpler terms, 6 times 2 equals 1 modulo 12 is 6 times 2, so: \n\n$(2/2)x \\equiv 1/2\\pmod{12}$\n$x \\equiv\\frac{1}{2} \\pmod{6}$\n\nNow we need to deal with the right-hand side. In the previous equation, $\\frac{1}{2}$ is a number that when multiplied with 2 equals 1, so we can rewrite it as: $\\frac{1}{2}$ times 2 equals 1, so:\n\n$x \\equiv 1\\pmod{6}$\n\nNow we have $x\\equiv a\\pmod{m}$ where a is 1 and m is 6. We need to find $a+m$. \n\nSo, $a+m = 1+6$ \n\n$a+m = 7$\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{7}$."
