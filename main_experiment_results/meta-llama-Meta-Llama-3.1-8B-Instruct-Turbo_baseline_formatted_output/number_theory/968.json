    "problem": "Three different natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors. How many factors does $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ have?",
    "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",

    "model_solution": "Since $x$, $y$, and $z$ each have exactly three factors, they must be in the form $p^2$ for some prime $p$, as the only way a number has exactly three factors is if it is the square of a prime.\n\nLet's say $x = p^2$, $y = q^2$, and $z = r^2$ for some primes $p$, $q$, and $r$.\n\nThen, $x^2y^3z^4 = (p^2)^2(q^2)^3(r^2)^4 = p^4q^6r^8$.\n\nTo find the number of factors of $x^2y^3z^4$, we use the formula that if a number $n$ is written as $p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}...p_k^{a_k}$, then the number of factors of $n$ is $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)...(a_k + 1)$.\n\nIn this case, $x^2y^3z^4 = p^4q^6r^8$, so the number of factors is $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1) = 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 9 = 315$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{315}$."
