    "problem": "Natural numbers of the form $F_n=2^{2^n} + 1 $ are called Fermat numbers. In 1640, Fermat conjectured that all numbers $F_n$, where $n\\neq 0$, are prime. (The conjecture was later shown to be false.) What is the units digit of $F_{1000}$?",
    "solution": "Let's first try to find the cycle of units digits of $2^n$, starting with $n=1$: $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $2^n$ is 4 digits long: 2, 4, 8, 6. To find the units digit of $2^n$, for any positive integer $n$, we simply need to find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 2, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 4, etc.) Since $2^{1000}\\div4=2^{998}$ without remainder, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6. Therefore, the units digit of $F_n=2^{2^{1000}}+1$ is $6+1=\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "The units digit of $F_{1000}$ is the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}} + 1$. \n\nSince $2^1 = 2$, $2^2 = 4$, $2^3 = 8$, $2^4 = 16$, the units digit of $2^n$ repeats every 4 powers: 2, 4, 8, 6.\n\nWe can find the remainder when $2^{1000}$ is divided by 4 to determine which units digit of $2^n$ we need.\n\nSince $2^{1000}$ is even, it can be written as $2 \\cdot k$ for some integer $k$. Therefore, $2^{1000} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\n\nThis means that $2^{1000} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, since every even number is divisible by 2 and therefore by 4.\n\nSo, the remainder when $2^{1000}$ is divided by 4 is 0.\n\nSince the remainder is 0, we need the units digit that corresponds to the 4th item in the cycle (0 mod 4): 6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6.\n\nAdding 1 to 6, we get 7.\n\nSo, the units digit of $F_{1000}$ is $\\boxed{7}$."
