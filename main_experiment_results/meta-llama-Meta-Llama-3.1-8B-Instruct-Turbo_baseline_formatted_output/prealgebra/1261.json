    "model_solution": "To find the percentage of x that equals to 40% of 50% of x, we first need to calculate 40% of 50% of x.\n\n40% of 50% of x is (40/100) * (50/100) * x \n= (2/10) * (1/2) * x \n= (1/10) * x \n\nSo, we need to find the percentage of x that equals to 1/10 of x. \n\nLet the required percentage be 'p'. \np/100 * x = 1/10 * x \n\nTo find 'p', we can cross multiply: \np * 10 = 100 \n\nNow, we divide both sides by 10: \np = 100/10 \np = 10 \n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{10}$."
