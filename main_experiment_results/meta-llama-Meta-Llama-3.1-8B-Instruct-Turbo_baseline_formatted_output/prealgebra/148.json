    "problem": "The average of the numbers 23 and $x$ is 27. What is the positive difference between 23 and $x$? (Recall that the average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2).",
    "solution": "To calculate the average of two numbers, we add them and divide the sum by $2$.  From the given information, we have the equation  \\[\\frac{23+x}{2}=27.\\]  Multiplying both sides by $2$ yields \\[23+x=54.\\]  Thus, $x=54-23=31$.  Finally, the positive difference between $31$ and $23$ is \\[31-23=\\boxed{8}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To find the average of 23 and x, we can use the formula: \n\nAverage = (23 + x) / 2\n\nWe are given that the average is 27, so we can set up the equation:\n\n(23 + x) / 2 = 27\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n23 + x = 54\n\nSubtracting 23 from both sides of the equation gives us:\n\nx = 31\n\nNow that we know the value of x, we can find the positive difference between 23 and x:\n\nDifference = |x - 23| = |31 - 23| = 8\n\nTherefore, the positive difference between 23 and x is $\\boxed{8}$."
