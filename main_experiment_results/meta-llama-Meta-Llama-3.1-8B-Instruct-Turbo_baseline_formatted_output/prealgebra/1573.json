    "problem": "A 12-slice pizza was made with only pepperoni and mushroom toppings, and every slice has at least one topping. Only six slices have pepperoni, and exactly ten slices have mushrooms. How many slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms?",
    "solution": "There are 12 total slices, and 6 of them have pepperoni and 10 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number of the slices that have both toppings, so there are $6-n$ with just pepperoni and $10-n$ with just mushrooms.  Since every slice has at least one topping, and there are 12 slices, we must have $(6-n) + (10-n) + n = 12$, which gives $n=\\boxed{4}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's use a Venn diagram to solve this problem. \n\nLet P be the set of slices with pepperoni, and M be the set of slices with mushrooms. \n\nWe know that |P| = 6 (the number of slices with pepperoni), and |M| = 10 (the number of slices with mushrooms). We also know that |P \u222a M| = 12 (the total number of slices).\n\nWe can use the inclusion-exclusion principle, which states that |P \u222a M| = |P| + |M| - |P \u2229 M|.\n\nRearranging this formula, we get |P \u2229 M| = |P| + |M| - |P \u222a M|.\n\nSubstituting the known values, we get |P \u2229 M| = 6 + 10 - 12.\n\nSimplifying, we get |P \u2229 M| = 4.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{4}$ slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms."
