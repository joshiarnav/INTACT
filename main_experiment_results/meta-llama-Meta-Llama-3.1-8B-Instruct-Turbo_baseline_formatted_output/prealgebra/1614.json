    "problem": "Angela has $a$ marbles, Brian has twice as many marbles as Angela, Caden has three times as many marbles as Brian, and Daryl has five times the number of marbles Caden has. If in total Angela, Brian, Caden and Daryl have 78 marbles, what is the value of $a?$",
    "solution": "First, quantify the number of marbles each person has:\n\n$\\bullet$ Angela has $a$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Brian has $2\\times a$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Caden has $3\\times(2\\times a)$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Daryl has $5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))$ marbles.\n\nIn total, the four people have $a+2\\times a+3\\times(2\\times a)+5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))$ marbles. And that expression equals 78, since in total the four people have 78 marbles. Now evaluate the resulting equation. \\begin{align*}\n78&=a+2\\times a+3\\times(2\\times a)+5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))\\\\\n&=a+2a+3(2a)+5(3(2a))\\\\\n&=a+2a+6a+5(6a)\\\\\n&=a+2a+6a+30a\\\\\n&=39a \\quad\\implies\\\\\na&=\\boxed{2}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "To solve for the value of $a$, we need to find the number of marbles each person has in terms of $a$. \n\nBrian has twice as many marbles as Angela, so Brian has $2a$ marbles.\n\nCaden has three times as many marbles as Brian, so Caden has $3(2a) = 6a$ marbles.\n\nDaryl has five times the number of marbles Caden has, so Daryl has $5(6a) = 30a$ marbles.\n\nThe total number of marbles is 78, so we can set up the equation: \n\n$a + 2a + 6a + 30a = 78$\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n$39a = 78$\n\nDivide both sides by 39:\n\n$a = 2$\n\nSo the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{2}$."
