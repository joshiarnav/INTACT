    "solution": "The chart shows the amounts of sales at the end of each year.  Therefore we're looking for a year on the chart that has the largest difference from the previous year.    Determining the sales that increased the most number of dollars is equivalent to finding the right endpoint of the segment with the steepest slope.  From observation, we can determine that that line corresponds to the year $\\boxed{1998}$.",

    "model_solution": "To determine the year in which sales increased the most number of dollars, we need to find the steepest increase from one year to the next on the graph. \n\nThe points on the graph show that the largest increase occurred from 1996 to 1998, but the question asks for the year after 1994. Therefore, if we look at the graph, we see that the year after 1994 in which sales increased the most was from 1996 to 1998, however, this is not the answer we are looking for. The year we are looking for is 1998."
