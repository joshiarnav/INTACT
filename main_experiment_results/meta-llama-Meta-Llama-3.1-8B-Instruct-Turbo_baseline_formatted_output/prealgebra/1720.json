    "problem": "Given three members of a group -- Alice, Bob, and Carol -- in how many ways can these three be chosen to be the three officers (president, secretary, and treasurer) of the group, assuming no person holds more than one job?",
    "solution": "In this problem we are choosing a committee, so the order in which we choose the 3 people does not matter.  We could have chosen them in any of the following orders (where A is Alice, B is Bob, and C is Carol): ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.  So each possible committee corresponds to $3! = \\boxed{6}$ possible orderings.",

    "model_solution": "There are three positions to be filled: president, secretary, and treasurer. For the president position, we have three choices (Alice, Bob, or Carol). \n\nOnce the president is chosen, there are two people left, and we have two choices for the secretary position. \n\nFinally, for the treasurer position, there is only one person left, so there is only one choice for this position.\n\nUsing the fundamental counting principle, the total number of ways to fill the three positions is $3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{6}$."
