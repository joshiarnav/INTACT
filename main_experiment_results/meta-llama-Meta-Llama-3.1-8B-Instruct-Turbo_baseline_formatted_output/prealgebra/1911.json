    "solution": "Number the points clockwise, beginning with the upper left as 1. Number the center point 7.\n\nWe can create six equilateral triangles with side length one: 176, 172, 273, 657, 574, and 473.\n\nWe can also create two equilateral triangles with side length $\\sqrt{3}$: 135 and 246.\n\nThus, there are $\\boxed{8}$ such equilateral triangles.",
