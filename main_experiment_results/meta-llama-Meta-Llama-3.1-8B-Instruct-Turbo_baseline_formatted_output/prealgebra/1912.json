    "solution": "Since the arithmetic mean of these expressions is 24, we can write the expression for the mean: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{(x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)}{5}&=24\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad (x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)&=5\\cdot 24\n\\end{align*}\n\nCombining like terms on the left, we find $5x+40=120$, so $5x=80$, from which we have $x=16$. Our final answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the arithmetic mean, we need to add up all the expressions and divide by the number of expressions. \n\nLet's add up the expressions: \n$(x + 8) + 15 + 2x + 13 + (2x + 4)$ \n\nCombine like terms: \n$5x + 40$\n\nSince there are 5 expressions, we need to divide the sum by 5. We are given that the arithmetic mean is 24, so we can set up an equation: \n$\\frac{5x + 40}{5} = 24$\n\nMultiply both sides by 5: \n$5x + 40 = 120$\n\nSubtract 40 from both sides: \n$5x = 80$\n\nDivide both sides by 5: \n$x = 16$\n\nThe value of $x$ is 16."
