    "problem": "What is the smallest positive number that is prime and $10$ less than a perfect square?",
    "solution": "A number 10 less than an even perfect square cannot be prime, so let's check odd perfect squares greater than 10:\n\n$\\bullet$ $5^2=25,$ $25-10=15,$ composite.\n\n$\\bullet$ $7^2=49,$ $49-10=39,$ composite.\n\n$\\bullet$ $9^2=81,$ $81-10=71.$\n\nChecking prime numbers up to $7$ $($the  largest prime less than $\\sqrt{71})$ as potential divisors, we  see that $71$ is prime. Thus, the smallest prime that is $10$ less  than a perfect square is $\\boxed{71}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest positive number that is prime and $10$ less than a perfect square, we need to consider perfect squares and subtract $10$ from them to check if the result is a prime number.\n\nThe first few perfect squares are:\n- $1^2 = 1$\n- $2^2 = 4$\n- $3^2 = 9$\n- $4^2 = 16$\n- $5^2 = 25$\n- $6^2 = 36$\n\nNow we subtract $10$ from each of these perfect squares and check for prime numbers:\n- $1 - 10 = -9$ (not a positive prime)\n- $4 - 10 = -6$ (not a positive prime)\n- $9 - 10 = -1$ (not a positive prime)\n- $16 - 10 = 6$ (not a positive prime)\n- $25 - 10 = 15$ (not a positive prime)\n- $36 - 10 = 26$ (not a positive prime)\n- $49 - 10 = 39$ (not a positive prime)\n- $64 - 10 = 54$ (not a positive prime)\n- $81 - 10 = 71$ (a positive prime)\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive number that is prime and $10$ less than a perfect square is $\\boxed{71}$."
