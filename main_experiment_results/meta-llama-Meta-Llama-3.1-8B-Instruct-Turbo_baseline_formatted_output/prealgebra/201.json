    "problem": "If only one quarter of the earth's surface is not covered by bodies of water, and only one half of that exposed land area is inhabitable for humans (because of poles, deserts, etc.), what fraction of the earth's surface can humans live on?",
    "solution": "One half of one quarter of the earth is $\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{4}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on, we need to multiply the fraction of exposed land area and the fraction of that land area that is inhabitable for humans.\n\nFirst, let's find the fraction of exposed land area. Since one quarter of the earth's surface is not covered by bodies of water, the fraction of exposed land area is 1/4.\n\nNext, we need to find the fraction of that exposed land area that is inhabitable for humans. We are given that this fraction is 1/2.\n\nNow, we multiply these two fractions to find the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on:\n\n1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8\n\nSo, the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on is 1/8.\n\n$\\boxed{1/8}$"
