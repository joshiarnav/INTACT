    "problem": "If $x^2 = y - 3$ and $x = -5$, then what is the value of $y$?",
    "solution": "Substituting $-5$ for $x$ in the first equation, we have $(-5)^2 = y-3$.  So $25=y-3$. Adding $3$ to both sides, $y=\\boxed{28}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of y, we can substitute x = -5 into the equation x^2 = y - 3.\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of x^2: \nx^2 = (-5)^2\nx^2 = 25\n\nNext, we substitute this value into the original equation: \n25 = y - 3\n\nTo find the value of y, we add 3 to both sides of the equation: \ny = 25 + 3\ny = 28\n\nTherefore, the value of y is $\\boxed{28}$."
