    "problem": "What is the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime?",
    "solution": "The two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7; the largest two-digit prime is 97 (98 and 99 are both composite).  The product of these three primes is $5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 97 = 35 \\cdot 97 = 35(100-3)=3500-105=\\boxed{3395}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime, we need to identify the prime numbers first.\n\nOne-digit primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7.\n\nTwo-digit primes range from 11 to 97. The largest two-digit prime is 97.\n\nNow, we multiply these numbers together: \n\n5 * 7 * 97 = 3395."
