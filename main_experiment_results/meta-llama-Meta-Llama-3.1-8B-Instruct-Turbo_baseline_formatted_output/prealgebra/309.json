    "problem": "In a history class, the probability of earning an A is .7 times the probability of earning a B, and the probability of earning a C is 1.4 times the probability of earning a B. Assuming that all grades are A, B, or C, how many B's will there be in a history class of 31 students?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of students who earn a B. Then we know that the number of students who get an A is $.7x$ and the number of students who earn a C is $1.4x$. Since every student in the class gets an A, B, or C and there are 31 students, this gives us the equation $.7x + x + 1.4x = 31 \\Rightarrow 3.1x = 31 \\Rightarrow x =\\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of B's in the class, we first need to set up an equation to represent the total probability of earning each grade.\n\nLet P(A), P(B), and P(C) be the probabilities of earning an A, B, and C, respectively. \n\nGiven that:\n- P(A) = 0.7P(B)\n- P(C) = 1.4P(B)\n- The total probability of earning each grade is 1, since all grades are A, B, or C.\n\nTherefore:\nP(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1\n0.7P(B) + P(B) + 1.4P(B) = 1\nCombine like terms:\n3.1P(B) = 1\nDivide both sides by 3.1:\nP(B) = 1 / 3.1\nP(B) = 0.3225806\n\nThe probability of earning a B is approximately 0.3226.\n\nTo find the number of B's, multiply this probability by the total number of students:\nNumber of B's \u2248 0.3226 * 31\n\u2248 10.00796\n\nSince the number of students must be a whole number, round to the nearest whole number:\nNumber of B's \u2248 10\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{10}$."
