    "model_solution": "To find the percentage of sales that were not pens or pencils, we need to subtract the sum of the percentages of pens and pencils from 100%. \n\nPercentage of pens and pencils = 38% + 35% = 73%\n\nPercentage of sales that were not pens or pencils = 100% - 73% = 27%\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{27}$%."
