    "solution": "A circle's radius is half its diameter, so if the diameter of a circle is 4 meters, then its radius is 2 meters.  The area of the circle is $\\pi(\\text{radius})^2=\\pi(2\\text{ m})^2=\\boxed{4\\pi}$ square meters.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of a circle, we need to use the formula: \n\nArea = $\\pi r^2$\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle. \n\nGiven the diameter is 4 meters, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is:\n\nr = 4 / 2 = 2 meters\n\nNow we can plug in the value of r into the formula:\n\nArea = $\\pi r^2$\n= $\\pi (2)^2$\n= $\\pi \\times 4$\n= $4\\pi$\n\nSo, the area of the circle is $4\\pi$ square meters.\n\n$\\boxed{4\\pi}$"
