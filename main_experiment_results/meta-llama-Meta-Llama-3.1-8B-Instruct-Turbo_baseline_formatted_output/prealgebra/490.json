    "problem": "The circular region of the sign (below, left) has an area of 154 square inches. Vanessa would like to place a tiny ribbon (shaded) around the circle's edge. To be sure she has enough ribbon, she decides to buy 2 inches more of the ribbon than the original circle's circumference. How many inches of ribbon will Vanessa need to buy if she estimates $\\pi = \\frac{22}{7}$?\n\n[asy]import graph;\nsize(125,72.5);\npicture p;\ndraw(p,unitsquare);\nfilldraw(p,Circle((.5,.5),.3),white);\nlabel(p,\"Enter\",(.5,.5),ZapfChancery(\"m\",\"n\"));\nadd(p);\nfilldraw(Circle((2,.5),.4),gray(.6));\nadd(shift(1.5*right)*p);\ndraw((1.1,.5)--(1.4,.5),EndArrow(5,25));[/asy]",
    "solution": "Say the radius of the circle is $r$. Then the area of the circle is $\\pi r^2,$ which we estimate to $154=\\frac{22}{7}r^2$. If we multiply both sides by $\\frac{7}{22}$, we get $r^2=49$ or $r=7$. The circle's circumference is $2\\pi r$, which we again estimate to $\\frac{44}{7}r=44$. Vanessa wants two extra inches of ribbon, so she needs to buy $44+2=\\boxed{46}$ inches of ribbon.",

    "model_solution": "To find out how much ribbon Vanessa needs to buy, we first need to find the circumference of the circle and then add 2 inches to it.\n\nGiven that the area of the circle is 154 square inches, and the formula for the area of a circle is $A = \\pi r^2$, we can substitute the given value of $\\pi = \\frac{22}{7}$ into this equation and solve for $r$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA &= \\pi r^2 \\\\\n154 &= \\frac{22}{7}r^2 \\\\\n154 \\cdot \\frac{7}{22} &= r^2 \\\\\n49 &= r^2 \\\\\n\\sqrt{49} &= r \\\\\n7 &= r\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe radius of the circle is 7 inches. Now we can find the circumference of the circle using the formula $C = 2\\pi r$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nC &= 2\\pi r \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot \\frac{22}{7} \\cdot 7 \\\\\n&= 44\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe circumference of the circle is 44 inches. Since Vanessa wants to buy 2 inches more than the circumference, she will need to buy:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n44 + 2 &= 46\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo, Vanessa needs to buy $\\boxed{46}$ inches of ribbon."
