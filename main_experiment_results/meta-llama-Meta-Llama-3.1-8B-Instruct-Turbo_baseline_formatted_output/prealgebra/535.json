    "problem": "We have a cube with 4 blue faces and 2 red faces.  What's the probability that when it is rolled, a blue face will be facing up?",
    "solution": "We have 6 equally likely outcomes, corresponding to the 6 faces of the cube.  4 of those 6 outcomes are successful ones (meaning a blue face is facing up).  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability of a blue face facing up when the cube is rolled, we need to know the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes (blue faces).\n\nThere are 6 faces on a cube, and since 4 of them are blue, the probability of a blue face facing up is:\n\n$\\frac{Number\\ of\\ blue\\ faces}{Total\\ number\\ of\\ faces} = \\frac{4}{6}$\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:\n\n$\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n\nSo, the probability that a blue face will be facing up when the cube is rolled is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$."
