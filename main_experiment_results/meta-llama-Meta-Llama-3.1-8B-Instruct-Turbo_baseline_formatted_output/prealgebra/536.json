    "problem": "A zoo has a menagerie containing four pairs of different animals, one male and one female for each. The zookeeper wishes to feed the animals in a specific pattern: each time he feeds a single animal, the next one he feeds must be a different gender. If he starts by feeding the male giraffe, how many ways can he feed all the animals?",
    "solution": "If the zookeeper starts with the male giraffe, there are 4 females which he can feed next. Once one is selected, there are 3 males he can feed next, then 3 females, 2 males, 2 females, 1 male, and 1 female.\n\nThe total number of possibilities is $4\\times3\\times3\\times2\\times2 = \\boxed{144}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nSince the zookeeper starts by feeding the male giraffe, the first animal is fixed. Now, the zookeeper needs to feed a female animal. There are 4 female animals, so there are 4 options for the second animal.\n\nAfter feeding the second animal, the zookeeper needs to feed a male animal. However, since one male has already been fed (the giraffe), there are only 4 - 1 = 3 male animals left to choose from.\n\nAfter feeding the third male animal, there are 3 female animals left. The zookeeper can choose any of these 3 females as the fourth animal.\n\nAfter feeding the fourth female animal, there are 2 male animals left, so the zookeeper has 2 options for the fifth animal.\n\nAfter feeding the fifth male animal, there are 2 female animals left, so the zookeeper has 2 options for the sixth animal.\n\nAfter feeding the sixth female animal, there are only 1 male animal left, so the zookeeper has only 1 option for the seventh animal.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of ways: \n\n4 (options for the second female) * 3 (options for the third male) * 3 (options for the fourth female) * 2 (options for the fifth male) * 2 (options for the sixth female) * 1 (option for the seventh male) = 4 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 = 144\n\nSo, there are 144 ways for the zookeeper to feed all the animals if he starts by feeding the male giraffe.\n\n$\\boxed{144}$"
