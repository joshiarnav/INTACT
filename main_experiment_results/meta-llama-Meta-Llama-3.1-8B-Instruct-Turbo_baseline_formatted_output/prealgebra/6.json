    "model_solution": "To find the total number of triangles, let's start by identifying the different sizes of triangles in the figure. \n\nFirst, there are the small triangles with no overlap. If we count them carefully, there are 11 small triangles in the figure.\n\nNext, there are the triangles made up of four small triangles. There are 4 of these larger triangles.\n\nLastly, there is one large triangle that consists of 9 small triangles.\n\nAdding the number of small triangles, the triangles made up of four small triangles, and the triangle made up of nine small triangles gives us the total number of triangles.\n\nSo, the total number of triangles is 11 + 4 + 1 = 16."
