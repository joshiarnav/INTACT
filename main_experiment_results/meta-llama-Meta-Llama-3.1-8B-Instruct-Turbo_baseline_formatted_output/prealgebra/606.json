    "problem": "An equilateral triangle has sides of length 2 units. A second equilateral triangle is formed having sides that are $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the first triangle. A third equilateral triangle is formed having sides that are $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the second triangle. The process is continued until four equilateral triangles exist. What will be the percent increase in the perimeter from the first triangle to the fourth triangle? Express your answer to the nearest tenth.",
    "solution": "If the side length of each successive equilateral triangle is $150\\%$ of the previous triangle, then we can multiply the previous side length by 1.5. We will need to do this three times to get to the fourth triangle, so its side length will be $$1.5^3 = 1.5 \\times 1.5 \\times 1.5 = 3.375$$ times the  original side length. This is the same as $337.5\\%$ of the original side length, which represents a $337.5 - 100 = 237.5\\%$ increase over the original side length. The perimeter is also a length, so it will be affected in the same way. The percent increase in the perimeter is $\\boxed{237.5\\%}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the percent increase in the perimeter from the first triangle to the fourth triangle, we first need to find the perimeters of the first and fourth triangles.\n\nThe first equilateral triangle has sides of length 2 units. \n\nThe perimeter of the first equilateral triangle is 3 * 2 = 6 units.\n\nThe second equilateral triangle has sides that are 150% of the length of the sides of the first triangle. Therefore, the sides of the second equilateral triangle are 2 * 1.5 = 3 units.\n\nThe perimeter of the second equilateral triangle is 3 * 3 = 9 units.\n\nThe third equilateral triangle has sides that are 150% of the length of the sides of the second triangle. Therefore, the sides of the third equilateral triangle are 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 units.\n\nThe perimeter of the third equilateral triangle is 3 * 4.5 = 13.5 units.\n\nThe fourth equilateral triangle has sides that are 150% of the length of the sides of the third triangle. Therefore, the sides of the fourth equilateral triangle are 4.5 * 1.5 = 6.75 units.\n\nThe perimeter of the fourth equilateral triangle is 3 * 6.75 = 20.25 units.\n\nThe increase in the perimeter from the first triangle to the fourth triangle is 20.25 - 6 = 14.25 units.\n\nThe percent increase in the perimeter from the first triangle to the fourth triangle is (14.25 / 6) * 100% \u2248 237.5%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{237.5}$."
