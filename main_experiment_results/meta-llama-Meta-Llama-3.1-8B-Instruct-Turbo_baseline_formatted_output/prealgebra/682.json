    "problem": "If $\\frac{5}{33}$ is expressed in decimal form, what digit is in the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point?",
    "solution": "When we write $\\frac{5}{33}$ as a decimal using long division, we get $0.\\overline{15}=0.15151515\\ldots$. Notice the pattern we have here: if $n$ is odd, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal point is $1$; if $n$ is even, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal place is $5$. Since $92$ is an even number, the digit at the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point is $\\boxed{5}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the digit in the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point for $\\frac{5}{33}$, we first convert the fraction to a decimal. \n\n$\\frac{5}{33} = 0.151515...$\n\nSince the decimal repeats in a pattern of six digits (15), we divide 92 by 6 to find which repetition the 92nd digit belongs to. \n\n$92 \\div 6 = 15$ with a remainder of 2. \n\nThis means that the 92nd digit is the second digit in the repetition (15), which is 5. \n\nTherefore, the digit in the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point for $\\frac{5}{33}$ is $\\boxed{5}$."
