    "problem": "If $x$ is a positive multiple of 8 and $x^2>100$, but $x<20$, what is $x$?",
    "solution": "This question gives multiple clues on what $x$ could be. Because $x^2>100$, we know that $x$ must be greater than 10, but $x$ is also less than 20. So $x$ is a multiple of 8 that is between 10 and 20. The only value that fits this description is $\\boxed{16}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $x$, we need to find the positive multiples of 8 that are less than 20 and whose square is greater than 100.\n\nThe multiples of 8 less than 20 are: 8, 16.\n\nChecking the squares of these numbers: \n- $8^2 = 64$ which is less than 100.\n- $16^2 = 256$ which is greater than 100.\n\nSince $16^2$ is greater than 100 and 16 is a multiple of 8, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{16}$."
