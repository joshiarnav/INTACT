    "problem": "A number in the set $\\{50, 51, 52, 53, ... , 999\\}$ is randomly selected. What is the probability that it is a two-digit number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "To count the number of numbers in this set, we subtract 49 from all of the numbers, giving the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 950 \\}$, making it obvious that there are 950 numbers total. Furthermore, the set $\\{ 50, 51, 52, \\ldots, 98, 99 \\}$ corresponds to the more easily counted $\\{ 1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 49, 50 \\}$ by subtracting 49. So, the probability of selecting a two-digit number is $\\frac{50}{950} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the randomly selected number is a two-digit number, we need to find the total number of two-digit numbers in the set and divide it by the total number of numbers in the set.\n\nThe set starts from 50 and ends at 999. So, the two-digit numbers are from 50 to 99. \n\nTo find the number of two-digit numbers, we subtract the starting number from the ending number, then add 1: \n99 - 50 + 1 = 50\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of numbers in the set. The set starts from 50 and ends at 999. To find the total number of numbers, we subtract the starting number from the ending number, then add 1: \n999 - 50 + 1 = 950\n\nNow, we can find the probability by dividing the number of two-digit numbers by the total number of numbers in the set:\nProbability = 50/950 = 1/19\n\nSo, the probability that the randomly selected number is a two-digit number is 1/19."
