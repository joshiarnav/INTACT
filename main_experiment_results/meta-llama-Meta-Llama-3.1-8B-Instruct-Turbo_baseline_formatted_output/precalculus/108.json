    "model_solution": "To find the point $P$ such that $AP = BP = CP = DP$, we need to find the intersection of the four spheres centered at $A, B, C,$ and $D$ with radii equal to the distances from $P$ to $A, B, C,$ and $D$ respectively.\n\nFirst, let's find the radii of the spheres:\n- $AD = \\sqrt{(0-8)^2 + (0-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \\sqrt{64} = 8$.\n- $BD = \\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (0-(-4))^2 + (0-0)^2} = \\sqrt{16} = 4$.\n- $CD = \\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 + (6-0)^2} = \\sqrt{36} = 6$.\n\nSince the radius of the sphere centered at $D$ is the same as the distance from $P$ to $D$, we know that $DP = 8$. This means that the four spheres intersect at a single point.\n\nSince the point $P$ is equidistant from the points $A, B, C,$ and $D$, it must be at the center of the four spheres. The center of the four spheres is the point that is equidistant from the points $A, B, C,$ and $D$.\n\nWe can find the center of the four spheres by finding the intersection of the three planes that are perpendicular to the line segments $AB, AC,$ and $AD$ and that pass through the midpoint of each line segment.\n\nThe equations of the planes are:\n- $2x + 4y + 12z = 0$ (perpendicular to $AB$ and passing through the midpoint of $AB$).\n- $8x + 4z = 0$ (perpendicular to $AC$ and passing through the midpoint of $AC$).\n- $8x - 8y = 0$ (perpendicular to $AD$ and passing through the midpoint of $AD$).\n\nWe can solve the system of equations to find the intersection of the three planes.\n\nFirst, let's solve the second and third equations to find the values of $x$ and $y$:\n\\begin{align*}\n8x + 4z &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2x + z &= 0\\\\\n8x - 8y &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x - y &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x &= y\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of $x$ into the first equation:\n\\begin{align*}\n2x + 4y + 12z &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2(x) + 4(x) + 12z &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2x + 4x + 12z &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6x + 12z &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x + 2z &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x &= -2z\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of $x$ into the second equation:\n\\begin{align*}\n2x + z &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2(-2z) + z &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -4z + z &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -3z &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad z &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $z = 0$, we know that $x = y = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the point $P$ is $(0,0,0)$.\n\n$\\boxed{(0,0,0)}$"
