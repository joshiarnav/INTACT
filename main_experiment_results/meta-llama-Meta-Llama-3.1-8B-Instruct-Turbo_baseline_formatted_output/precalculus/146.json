    "problem": "A certain regular tetrahedron has three of its vertices at the points $(0,1,2),$ $(4,2,1),$ and $(3,1,5).$  Find the coordinates of the fourth vertex, given that they are also all integers.",
    "solution": "The side length of the regular tetrahedron is the distance between $(0,1,2)$ and $(4,2,1),$ which is\n\\[\\sqrt{(0 - 4)^2 + (1 - 2)^2 + (2 - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{18} = 3 \\sqrt{2}.\\]So if $(x,y,z)$ is the fourth vertex, with integer coordinates, then\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 2)^2 &= 18, \\\\\n(x - 4)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + (z - 1)^2 &= 18, \\\\\n(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 5)^2 &= 18.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting the first and third equations, we get $6x + 6z - 30 = 0$, so $x + z = 5,$ which means $z = 5 - x.$  Subtracting the first and second equation, we get $8x + 2y - 2z - 16 = 0,$ so\n\\[y = z - 4x + 8 = (5 - x) - 4x + 8 = 13 - 5x.\\]Substituting into the first equation, we get\n\\[x^2 + (12 - 5x)^2 + (3 - x)^2 = 18.\\]This simplifies to $27x^2 - 126x + 135 = 0,$ which factors as $9(x - 3)(3x - 5) = 0.$  Since $x$ is an integer, $x = 3.$  Then $y = -2$ and $z = 2.$  Thus, the fourth vertex is $\\boxed{(3,-2,2)}.$",

    "model_solution": "A regular tetrahedron has three mutually perpendicular edges from each vertex, each edge has the same length. We need to find the length of an edge to find the fourth point.\n\nThe distance between points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ is given by the formula $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2}$.\n\nLet's find the distance between $(0, 1, 2)$ and $(4, 2, 1)$:\n$\\sqrt{(4-0)^2+(2-1)^2+(1-2)^2} = \\sqrt{16+1+1} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow we need to find the distance between $(0, 1, 2)$ and $(3, 1, 5)$:\n$\\sqrt{(3-0)^2+(1-1)^2+(5-2)^2} = \\sqrt{9+0+9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe distance between points is the same, so we can use the formula for the distance between two points and the Pythagorean theorem to find the fourth point:\n\nThe equation of a plane in 3D space is $ax + by + cz = d$. \n\nSince the distance between the point $(0, 1, 2)$ and the point $(3, 1, 5)$ is $3\\sqrt{2}$, we can use the point $(0, 1, 2)$ as a reference point with $x=0, y=1, z=2$. Then, $(x-0)^2+(y-1)^2+(z-2)^2=18$ is the equation of the plane. \n\nSince $(4, 2, 1)$ is also on the plane we can plug in the values for $x, y,$ and $z$ to get \n$(4-0)^2+(2-1)^2+(1-2)^2=18$.\n\nTo find a point on the plane at a distance of $3\\sqrt{2}$ from point $(0, 1, 2)$ with integer coordinates, we need to find the point that has the same distance as point $(4,2,1)$. This means the point $(4,2,1)$ must be on the plane we are looking for. The point with the coordinates $(4,2,1)$ also has to have the same distance from the fourth point as the distance between $(4, 2, 1)$ and $(0, 1, 2)$. \n\nWe know the equation of the plane with point $(0, 1, 2)$:\n$(x-0)^2+(y-1)^2+(z-2)^2=18$.\n\nNow we need to find the equation of the plane that also passes through point $(4,2,1)$.\nThe equation of a plane in 3D space is $ax + by + cz = d$. We can find $a, b, c$ by using two points on the plane.\n\nThe difference between the two points on the plane:\n$\\begin{bmatrix}4\\\\2\\\\1\\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\1\\\\2\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}4\\\\1\\\\-1\\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThe normal vector of the plane is the cross product of the two vectors.\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix}a\\\\b\\\\c\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}4\\\\1\\\\-1\\end{bmatrix} \\times \\begin{bmatrix}4\\\\1\\\\-1\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{vmatrix}\\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ 4 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 4 & 1 & -1 \\\\\\end{vmatrix} = \\begin{vmatrix}1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\\\\\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{i}-\\begin{vmatrix}4 & -1 \\\\ 4 & -1 \\\\\\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{j}+\\begin{vmatrix}4 & 1 \\\\ 4 & 1 \\\\\\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{k} =  \\mathbf{i} - 9\\mathbf{j} + 0\\mathbf{k}$. So, $a = 1, b = -9, c = 0$.\n\nNow, the equation of the plane is $1x - 9y + 0z = d$. We can plug in the point $(4, 2, 1)$ to find $d$.\n$1(4) - 9(2) + 0(1) = d \\implies d = -14$.\n\nNow the equation of the plane is $x - 9y = -14$.\n\nNow, we need to find the fourth point on the plane. We also know that the distance between the points $(4,2,1)$ and $(0,1,2)$ is $3\\sqrt{2}$ so we can find the fourth point by using the plane's equation and the distance between the point and $(4,2,1)$.\n\nThe distance between points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ is given by the formula $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2}$.\n\nThe distance between points $(0,1,2)$ and $(4,2,1)$ is $3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe point $(4,2,1)$ has coordinates $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$. We can find the distance between point $(4, 2, 1)$ and the fourth point $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$:\n$\\sqrt{(x_2-4)^2+(y_2-2)^2+(z_2-1)^2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow we can solve the distance formula for $x_2, y_2, z_2$.\n$(x_2-4)^2+(y_2-2)^2+(z_2-1)^2 = 18$\n\n$\\implies x_2^2-8x_2+16+y_2^2-4y_2+4+z_2^2-2z_2+1 = 18$\n\n$\\implies x_2^2+y_2^2+z_2^2-8x_2-4y_2-2z_2+21 = 18$\n\n$\\implies x_2^2+y_2^2+z_2^2-8x_2-4y_2-2z_2 = -3$\n\nNow, we need to find $x_2, y_2, z_2$ that is on the plane with point $(4,2,1)$, the distance between the points is $3\\sqrt{2}$, and also have integer coordinates.\n\nThe equation of the plane is $x - 9y = -14$. We can plug in the values for $x, y,$ and $z$ to get \n$x_2-9y_2=-14$.\n\nNow we have the equation $x_2^2+y_2^2+z_2^2-8x_2-4y_2-2z_2 = -3$ with $x_2-9y_2=-14$. We can plug in the values for $x_2$ and $y_2$ to get \n$x_2 = -14 + 9y_2$.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n$(-14 + 9y_2)^2+y_2^2+z_2^2-8(-14 + 9y_2)-4y_2-2z_2 = -3$.\n\nExpanding the equation:\n$196-252y_2+81y_2^2+y_2^2+z_2^2+112-72y_2-4y_2-2z_2 = -3$\n\n$\\implies 81y_2^2+y_2^2-328y_2+z_2^2-2z_2+305 = -3$\n\n$\\implies 82y_2^2-328y_2+z_2^2-2z_2+308 = 0$\n\nWe can plug in the values for $z_2$ to find the value for $y_2$.\nPlugging in $z_2 = 0$ we get:\n$82y_2^2-328y_2 = -308$\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n$41y_2^2-164y_2 = -154$\n\n$\\implies 41y_2(y_2-4) = -154$\n\n$\\implies y_2(y_2-4) = -\\frac{154}{41}$.\n\nSince $y_2$ is an integer we plug in values for $y_2$ to find the value that satisfies the equation.\n\nFor $y_2 = 0$, the equation becomes:\n$-4 = -\\frac{154}{41}$ which is not true.\n\nFor $y_"
