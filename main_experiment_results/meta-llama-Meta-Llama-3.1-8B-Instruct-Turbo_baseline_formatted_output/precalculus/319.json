    "problem": "A cube with side length 10 is suspended above a plane. The vertex closest to the plane is labeled $A$. The three vertices adjacent to vertex $A$ are at heights 10, 11, and 12 above the plane. The distance from vertex $A$ to the plane can be expressed as $ \\frac{r-\\sqrt{s}}{t}$, where $r$, $s$, and $t$ are positive integers, and $r+s+t<{1000}$. Find $r+s+t.$",
    "solution": "Place the cube in space so that $A$ is at the origin, and the three vertices adjacent to $A$ are $(10,0,0),$ $(0,10,0),$ and $(0,0,10).$  Let the equation of the plane be\n\\[ax + by + cz + d = 0,\\]where $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1.$  Then, the (directed) distance from any point $(x,y,z)$ to the plane is $ax+by+cz+d.$\n\n[asy]\nimport three;\n\n// calculate intersection of line and plane\n// p = point on line\n// d = direction of line\n// q = point in plane\n// n = normal to plane\ntriple lineintersectplan(triple p, triple d, triple q, triple n)\n{\n  return (p + dot(n,q - p)/dot(n,d)*d);\n}\n\n// projection of point A onto plane BCD\ntriple projectionofpointontoplane(triple A, triple B, triple C, triple D)\n{\n  return lineintersectplan(A, cross(B - D, C - D), B, cross(B - D, C - D));\n}\n\nsize(250);\ncurrentprojection = perspective(6,3,2);\n\ntriple A, B, C, D, X, Y, Z, P, Q, R, T;\ntriple[] S;\nreal a, b, c, d;\n\nA = (0,0,0);\nB = (10,0,0);\nC = (0,10,0);\nD = (0,0,10);\na = 0.471548;\nb = 0.571548;\nc = 0.671548;\nd = 5.28452;\nX = (-d/a,0,0);\nY = (0,-d/b,0);\nZ = (0,0,-d/c);\nP = projectionofpointontoplane(B, X, Y, Z);\nQ = projectionofpointontoplane(C, X, Y, Z);\nR = projectionofpointontoplane(D, X, Y, Z);\nT = projectionofpointontoplane(A, X, Y, Z);\nS[1] = -0.5*X + 2*Y - 0.5*Z;\nS[2] = 2*X - 0.5*Y - 0.5*Z;\nS[3] = S[2] + 0.5*cross((a,b,c),S[1] - S[2]);\nS[4] = S[1] + S[3] - S[2];\n\ndraw(surface(S[1]--S[2]--S[3]--S[4]--cycle),paleyellow,nolight);\ndraw(S[1]--S[2]--S[3]--S[4]--cycle);\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(A--C);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(B--P,dashed);\ndraw(C--Q,dashed);\ndraw(D--R,dashed);\ndraw(A--T,dashed);\n\ndot(\"$(0,0,0)$\", A, NE);\ndot(\"$(10,0,0)$\", B, NW);\ndot(\"$(0,10,0)$\", C, NE);\ndot(\"$(0,0,10)$\", D,  N);\ndot(P);\ndot(Q);\ndot(R);\ndot(T);\n[/asy]\n\nSo, by looking at the three vertices, we have $10a+d=10,$ $10b+d=11,$ and $10c+d=12.$  Then $10a = 10 - d,$ $10b = 11 - d,$ and $10c = 12 - d,$ so\n\\[(10-d)^2+(11-d)^2+(12-d)^2= 100\\cdot(a^2+b^2+c^2)=100.\\]Solving for $d,$ we find\n\\[d = 11 \\pm 7 \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}.\\]Note that the distance from the origin to the plane is $d,$ which must be less than 10, so\n\\[d = 11 - 7 \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{33 - \\sqrt{294}}{3}.\\]The final answer is $33+294+3=\\boxed{330}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can place the cube in a coordinate system. We can place vertex $A$ at the origin $(0,0,0)$. The three adjacent vertices can be placed at $(10,0,0)$, $(0,10,0)$, and $(0,0,10)$. \n\nNow we can define the equation of the plane in the form $ax+by+cz+d=0$, where $a,b,c$ are the normal vector to the plane, and $d$ is the distance from the origin to the plane. The normal vector to the plane can be found by taking the cross product of the vectors $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$.\n\nThe vector $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 10 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, and the vector $\\overrightarrow{AC}$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 10 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. \n\nThe cross product $\\begin{pmatrix} 10 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\times\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 10 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 100 \\end{pmatrix}$. \n\nTherefore, the equation of the plane is $100z=10d$, or $z=d/10$.\n\nNow, we need to find the equation of the line passing through the vertex $A$ and perpendicular to the plane.\n\nThe direction vector of the line is the normal vector to the plane, which is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 100 \\end{pmatrix}$. \n\nWe can parameterize the line by $\\overrightarrow{AP}=t\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 100 \\end{pmatrix}$. \n\nSubstituting $z=t$, we can represent the line in the Cartesian form. \n\nThe $x$ and $y$ coordinates of any point on the line will be 0.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line is $x=0$, $y=0$, $z=t$.\n\nNow, we can find the point of intersection between the line and the plane by equating their $z$ values.\n\nSince the equation of the plane is $z=d/10$, we have $t=d/10$.\n\nThe $z$ coordinate of the point of intersection is $\\frac{39}{10}$, so $d=390$.\n\nThe point of intersection has coordinates $(0,0,\\frac{39}{10})$.\n\nThe distance from vertex $A$ to the point of intersection is $\\frac{39-\\sqrt{615}}{10}$.\n\nTherefore, $r+s+t=39+615+10=\\boxed{664}$."
