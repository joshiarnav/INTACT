    "model_solution": "To find the area of the parallelogram with vertices $\\bold{0}$, $\\bold{v}$, $\\bold{w}$, and $\\bold{v} + \\bold{w}$, we can use the cross product of the vectors $\\bold{v}$ and $\\bold{w}$. \n\nHowever, since the vectors $\\bold{v}$ and $\\bold{w}$ are in 2D space, we can simply take the absolute value of the determinant of a 2x2 matrix formed by the components of the vectors. \n\nThe 2x2 matrix formed by the components of the vectors is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n5 & 11 \\\\\n-3 & -2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n$5(-2) - 11(-2) = -10 + 22 = -12 + 22 = 12$\n\nThe area of the parallelogram is the absolute value of this determinant, which is $|12| = 12$.\n\nSo the final answer is $\\boxed{12}$."
