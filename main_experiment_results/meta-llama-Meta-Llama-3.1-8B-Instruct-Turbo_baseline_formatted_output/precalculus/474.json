    "problem": "What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that all the roots of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity?",
    "solution": "Multiplying the equation $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ by $z^2 + 1$, we get $z^6 + 1 = 0$.  Multiplying this equation by $z^6 - 1 = 0$, we get $z^{12} - 1 = 0$.  Therefore, every root of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ is a $12^{\\text{th}}$ root of unity.\n\nWe can factor $z^{12} - 1 = 0$ as\n\\[(z^6 - 1)(z^6 + 1) = (z^6 - 1)(z^2 + 1)(z^4 - z^2 + 1) = 0.\\]The $12^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity are $e^{0}$, $e^{2 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{4 \\pi i/12}$, $\\dots$, $e^{22 \\pi i/12}$.  We see that $e^{0}$, $e^{4 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{8 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{12 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{16 \\pi i/12}$, and $e^{20 \\pi i/12}$ are the roots of $z^6 - 1 = 0$.  Also, $e^{6 \\pi i/12} = e^{\\pi i/2} = i$ and $e^{18 \\pi i/12} = e^{3 \\pi i/2} = -i$ are the roots of $z^2 + 1 = 0$.  Thus, the roots of\n\\[z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0\\]are the remaining four $12^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity, namely $e^{2 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{10 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{14 \\pi i/12}$, and $e^{22 \\pi i/12}$.  The complex number $e^{2 \\pi i/12}$ is a primitive $12^{\\text{th}}$ root of unity, so by definition, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $(e^{2 \\pi i/12})^n = 1$ is 12.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's start by substituting $x=z^2$ in the given equation. This gives us the equation $x^2-x+1=0$. \n\nWe can then find the roots of this equation using the quadratic formula, which is:\n\n$x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn this case, $a=1$, $b=-1$, and $c=1$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$x=\\frac{-(-1)\\pm\\sqrt{(-1)^2-4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$x=\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{1-4}}{2}$\n\n$x=\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{-3}}{2}$\n\nThe roots of this equation are $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-3}}{2}$ and $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{-3}}{2}$.\n\nWe can rewrite $\\sqrt{-3}$ as $\\sqrt{3}i$. So, the roots of the equation are:\n\n$\\frac{1+\\sqrt{3}i}{2}$ and $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{3}i}{2}$\n\nNow, we have that $z^2$ can be equal to either $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{3}i}{2}$ or $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{3}i}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, $z$ can be equal to either $\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\sqrt{3}i}{2}}$ or $\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\sqrt{3}i}{2}}$.\n\nWe notice that $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{3}i}{2}$ is a primitive sixth root of unity, and $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{3}i}{2}$ is also a primitive sixth root of unity.\n\nLet $w=e^{2\\pi i/12}$. Then, $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{3}i}{2} = w^2$ and $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{3}i}{2} = w^4$. \n\nThis means that $\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\sqrt{3}i}{2}} = w$ and $\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\sqrt{3}i}{2}} = w^3$.\n\nSince $w$ is a 12th root of unity, the roots of the original equation are 12th roots of unity.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that all the roots of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity is $n=\\boxed{12}$."
