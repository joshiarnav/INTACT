    "model_solution": "To find the lengths of the segments $AB$, $AC$, and $BC$, we need to determine the coordinates of the points $A$, $B$, and $C$. \n\nThe midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$ is $(l,0,0)$, so we can let the coordinates of $B$ be $(2l, x, y)$ and the coordinates of $C$ be $(2l - x', y', z')$ for some real numbers $x$, $x'$, $y$, and $z'$. Since the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$ is $(l,0,0)$, the average of the $x$-coordinates of $B$ and $C$ is $l$. Thus, we have $\\frac{2l + (2l - x')}{2} = l$, which implies that $x' = 0$. Similarly, the average of the $y$-coordinates of $B$ and $C$ is $0$, which implies that $y = 0$. Finally, the average of the $z$-coordinates of $B$ and $C$ is $0$, which implies that $z' = 0$. Thus, the coordinates of $B$ are $(2l, 0, 0)$ and the coordinates of $C$ are $(2l, 0, 0)$.\n\nSimilarly, the midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$ is $(0, m, 0)$, so we can let the coordinates of $A$ be $(x'', y'', z'')$ and the coordinates of $C$ be $(2l, 0, 0)$. Since the midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$ is $(0, m, 0)$, the average of the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $C$ is $0$, which implies that $x'' = 2l$. Similarly, the average of the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $C$ is $m$, which implies that $y'' = m$. Finally, the average of the $z$-coordinates of $A$ and $C$ is $0$, which implies that $z'' = 0$. Thus, the coordinates of $A$ are $(2l, m, 0)$.\n\nFinally, the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ is $(0, 0, n)$, so we can let the coordinates of $A$ be $(2l, m, 0)$ and the coordinates of $B$ be $(2l, 0, 0)$. Since the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ is $(0, 0, n)$, the average of the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is $0$, which is true, the average of the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is $0$, which is true, and the average of the $z$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is $n$, which implies that $n = 0$.\n\nThe lengths of the segments $AB$, $AC$, and $BC$ are the distances between the points $A$, $B$, and $C$. We have $A = (2l, m, 0)$, $B = (2l, 0, 0)$, and $C = (2l, 0, 0)$, so the length of $AB$ is $\\sqrt{(2l - 2l)^2 + (0 - m)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{m^2} = m$. The length of $AC$ is $\\sqrt{(2l - 2l)^2 + (m - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{m^2} = m$. The length of $BC$ is $\\sqrt{(2l - 2l)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{0} = 0$.\n\nWe are asked to find $\\frac{AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2}{l^2 + m^2 + n^2}$, which is equal to $\\frac{m^2 + m^2 + 0}{l^2 + m^2 + 0}$. This is equal to $\\frac{2m^2}{l^2 + m^2}$."
