Scale this vector by $-2$.\n3. Add the scaled vector to the center to find the image.\n\nStep 1: Find the vector from the center to $2i$.\nThe center is $-1 + 4i$ and the original point is $2i$. \nSo, the vector is $(2i) - (-1 + 4i)$.\nThis simplifies to $1 - 2i$.\n\nStep 2: Scale this vector by $-2$.\nMultiplying the vector $1 - 2i$ by $-2$ gives $-2 + 4i$.\n\nStep 3: Add the scaled vector to the center to find the image.\nAdding the scaled vector $-2 + 4i$ to the center $-1 + 4i$ gives:\n$(-1 + 4i) + (-2 + 4i)$, which is $-3 + 8i$.\n\nTherefore, the dilation centered at $-1 + 4i$ with scale factor $-2$ takes $2i$ to $\\boxed{-3 + 8i}$."
