    "solution": "The vector pointing from $(-1,1,1)$ to $(1,-1,1)$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$  Since the plane we are interested in is perpendicular to the plane $x + 2y + 3z = 5,$ its normal vector must be orthogonal to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}.$  But the normal vector of the plane is also orthogonal to $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$  So, to find the normal vector of the plane we are interested in, we take the cross product of these vectors:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -6 \\\\ -6 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Scaling, we take $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector.  Therefore, the equation of the plane is of the form\n\\[x + y - z + D = 0.\\]Substituting the coordinates of $(-1,1,1),$ we find that the equation of the plane is $\\boxed{x + y - z + 1 = 0}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the equation of the plane passing through the given points and perpendicular to another plane, we need to find a normal vector to the target plane.\n\nFirst, we note that the given plane has equation $x + 2y + 3z = 5,$ so the coefficients of $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are the components of the normal vector to that plane. Thus, the normal vector to the given plane is $\\mathbf{n}_1 = \\langle 1,2,3\\rangle.$\n\nNext, we find a normal vector to the target plane by finding a vector that is perpendicular to the given plane. We can do this by taking the cross product of another vector with the normal vector of the given plane.\n\nWe'll take the vector from one of the given points, $(-1,1,1),$ to the other, $(1,-1,1),$ as the other vector. This is given by\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{v} &= \\langle 1,-1,1\\rangle - \\langle -1,1,1\\rangle\\\\\n&= \\langle 1 - (-1), -1 - 1, 1 - 1\\rangle\\\\\n&= \\langle 2,-2,0\\rangle.\n\\end{align*}\nTaking the cross product of this with the normal vector to the given plane, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{n}_2 &= \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{n}_1\\\\\n&= \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k}\\\\\n2 & -2 & 0\\\\\n1 & 2 & 3\n\\end{vmatrix}\\\\\n&= \\mathbf{i}(-6-0) - \\mathbf{j}(6-0) + \\mathbf{k}(4+4)\\\\\n&= \\langle -6, -6, 8\\rangle.\n\\end{align*}\nThis is the normal vector to the target plane.\n\nWe can now use this normal vector and one of the given points to find the equation of the target plane. Using the point-normal form of the equation of a plane,\n\\begin{align*}\nA(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) &= 0,\n\\end{align*}\nwe get\n\\begin{align*}\n-6(x + 1) - 6(y - 1) + 8(z - 1) &= 0\\\\\n-6x - 6 - 6y + 6 + 8z - 8 &= 0\\\\\n-6x - 6y + 8z - 8 &= 0\\\\\n6x + 6y - 8z + 8 &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\nWe therefore have that the equation of the target plane is \\boxed{6x + 6y - 8z + 8 = 0}."
