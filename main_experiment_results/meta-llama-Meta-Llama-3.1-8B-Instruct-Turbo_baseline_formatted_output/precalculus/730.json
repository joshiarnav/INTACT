    "model_solution": "We are given that $wz = 12-8i$ and $|w| = \\sqrt{13}$.\n\nWe know that the product of the magnitudes of two complex numbers $w$ and $z$ is equal to the magnitude of their product, so $|w||z| = |wz|$. \n\nWe are given $|w| = \\sqrt{13}$ and we can find $|wz|$ by finding the magnitude of $12-8i$.\n\nThe magnitude of a complex number $a+bi$ is given by $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. \n\nIn this case, $a = 12$ and $b = -8$, so $|wz| = \\sqrt{12^2 + (-8)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 64} = \\sqrt{208} = 4\\sqrt{13}$.\n\nSo $|w||z| = |wz| \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{13}|z| = 4\\sqrt{13}$. \n\nDividing both sides by $\\sqrt{13}$, we get $|z| = 4$."
