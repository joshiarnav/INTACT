    "solution": "We can take $\\begin{pmatrix} 12 \\\\ -4 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector of the plane.  Then the equation of the plane is of the form\n\\[12x - 4y + 3z + D = 0.\\]Substituting in the coordinates of $(12,-4,3),$ we find that the equation of the plane is $\\boxed{12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0}.$",

    "model_solution": "Since the foot of the perpendicular from the origin to the plane is $(12,-4,3),$ we can use the vector $\\mathbf{n} = \\langle 12, -4, 3 \\rangle,$ which is normal to the plane.  This gives us the equation\n\\[12x - 4y + 3z + D = 0.\\]\nNow, we can plug in the point $(12,-4,3)$ into the equation to solve for $D$:\n\\begin{align*}\n12(12) - 4(-4) + 3(3) + D &= 0 \\\\\n144 + 16 + 9 + D &= 0 \\\\\n169 + D &= 0\n\\end{align*}\nSolving for $D$, we get \\[D = -169.\\]\nTherefore, the equation of the plane is\n\\[\\boxed{12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0.}\\]"
