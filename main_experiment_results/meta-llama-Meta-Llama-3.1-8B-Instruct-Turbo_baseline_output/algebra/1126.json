    "model_solution": "To find the vertical asymptote of the function $y=\\frac{x+2}{5x-7}$, we need to find the value of $x$ that makes the denominator equal to zero. \n\nWe set the denominator $5x-7$ equal to zero and solve for $x$:\n\n$5x - 7 = 0$\n\nAdding 7 to both sides:\n\n$5x = 7$\n\nDividing both sides by 5:\n\n$x = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\nSo, the vertical asymptote of the function $y=\\frac{x+2}{5x-7}$ is at $x = \\frac{7}{5}$."
