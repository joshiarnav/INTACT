    "model_solution": "To find $f(g(5))$, we need to follow the order of operations:\n\n1. First, we'll evaluate the inner function, $g(5)$. \nWe plug $x=5$ into $g(x)=2x-1$:\n$g(5) = 2(5) - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9$\n\n2. Now that we have $g(5) = 9$, we can plug this value into the outer function, $f(x) = x^2 + 1$:\n$f(g(5)) = f(9) = 9^2 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82$\n\nSo, $f(g(5)) = 82$."
