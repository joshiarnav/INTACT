    "problem": "Given that $f(x) = x^k$ where $k < 0$, what is the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$?",
    "solution": "We are looking at the range of $f(x)$ when $x$ is in the interval $[1,\\infty)$. Because $k < 0$, $f(x)$ is decreasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. We see that $f(1) = 1^k = 1$, and as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ approaches 0, but never reaches it.  Hence, on the interval $[1,\\infty)$, $f(x)$ takes on all values between 0 (exclusive) and 1 inclusive, which means the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{(0,1]}$.",

    "model_solution": "Since $f(x) = x^k$ where $k < 0$, this function is a decreasing function on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ because as $x$ increases, $x^k$ decreases.\n\nTo find the range of $f(x)$, we can evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval and at some points within the interval.\n\nAt $x = 1$, we have $f(1) = 1^k = 1$.\n\nAs $x$ approaches $\\infty$, we have $f(x) = x^k \\to 0$ because $k < 0$. This means that the function values get arbitrarily close to 0 but never reach it.\n\nTherefore, the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ is $(0, 1]$.\n\nNote that since $k < 0$, the function is not defined at $x = 0$, but we can still find the range of the function on the interval $[1, \\infty)$, which is $(0, 1]$."
