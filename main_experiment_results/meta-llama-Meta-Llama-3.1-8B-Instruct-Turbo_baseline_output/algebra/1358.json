    "problem": "A ball travels on a parabolic path in which the height (in feet) is given by the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$, where $t$ is the time after launch. What is the maximum height of the ball, in feet?",
    "solution": "To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \\[-16t^2+80t+21=-16(t^2-5t)+21\\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-5/2)^2=6.25$ inside the parenthesis to get \\begin{align*}\n-16(t^2-5t)+21&=-16(t^2-5t+6.25-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16([t-2.5]^2-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16(t-2.5)^2+121\n\\end{align*}Since $-16(t-2.5)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-2.5)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+121=\\boxed{121}$ feet.",

    "model_solution": "To find the maximum height of the ball, we need to find the vertex of the parabolic path. The vertex of a parabola in the form $-at^2 + bt + c$ is given by the equation $t = -\\frac{b}{2a}$.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the values of $a$ and $b$ in the given expression: $-16t^2+80t+21$. Here, $a = -16$ and $b = 80$.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation for the t-coordinate of the vertex:\n\n$t = -\\frac{b}{2a}$\n$t = -\\frac{80}{2(-16)}$\n$t = -\\frac{80}{-32}$\n$t = \\frac{5}{2}$\n\nThe t-coordinate of the vertex is $\\frac{5}{2}$ seconds. To find the maximum height, we plug this value into the original expression:\n\n$h = -16t^2 + 80t + 21$\n$h = -16(\\frac{5}{2})^2 + 80(\\frac{5}{2}) + 21$\n$h = -16(\\frac{25}{4}) + 200 + 21$\n$h = -100 + 200 + 21$\n$h = 121$\n\nThe maximum height of the ball is 121 feet."
