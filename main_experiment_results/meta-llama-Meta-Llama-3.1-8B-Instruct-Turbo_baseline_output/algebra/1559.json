    "problem": "If $27^8=9^q$, what is $q$?",
    "solution": "We begin by expressing both sides of the equation in terms of the base 2: $(3^3)^8=(3^2)^q$, which simplifies to $3^{24}=3^{2q}$. Setting the exponents equal to each other, $24=2q$, or $q=\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of q, we can start by expressing both sides of the equation with the same base. \n\nSince $27 = 3^3$ and $9 = 3^2,$ we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$(3^3)^8 = (3^2)^q$\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n$3^{24} = 3^{2q}$\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n\n$24 = 2q$\n\nNow, we can solve for q by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n$q = 12$\n\nSo, the value of q is 12."
