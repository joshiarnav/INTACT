    "problem": "A triangular region is bounded by the two coordinate axes and the line given by the equation $2x + y = 6$. What is the area of the region, in square units?",
    "solution": "To start, use the equation to solve for the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the line.  Letting $x$ equal 0, the $y$-intercept is 6.  Letting $y$ equal 0, we find that $2x=6$ so the $x$-intercept is 3.  Using the intercepts, we can graph the line as shown: [asy]size(100,0);\nfill((0,0)--(0,6)--(3,0)--cycle,gray(.7));\nadd(grid(5,8));\ndraw((0,0)--(5,0),linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,8),linewidth(2));\nlabel(\"\",(5,0),E);\nlabel(\"\",(0,8),N);\ndraw((0,6)--(3,0),blue,Arrows);[/asy] We wish to find the area of the shaded region.  This is a right triangle with one base of length 3, and one of length 6.  Therefore, the area is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3\\cdot 6=\\boxed{9}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the region, we first need to find the vertices of the triangle. The line given by the equation $2x + y = 6$ intersects the x-axis and the y-axis. \n\nTo find the x-intercept, we let y = 0 and solve for x: \n2x + 0 = 6\n2x = 6\nx = 6/2\nx = 3\n\nSo, the x-intercept is (3, 0).\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we let x = 0 and solve for y:\n0 + y = 6\ny = 6\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, 6).\n\nNow, we can find the area of the triangle using the formula: \nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nThe base of the triangle is the distance between the x-intercept and the y-axis, which is 3 units. \nThe height of the triangle is the distance between the y-intercept and the x-axis, which is 6 units.\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is:\nArea = (3 * 6) / 2\nArea = 18 / 2\nArea = 9\n\nTherefore, the area of the region is 9 square units."
