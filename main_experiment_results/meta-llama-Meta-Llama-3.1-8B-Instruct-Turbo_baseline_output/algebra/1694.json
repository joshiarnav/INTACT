    "problem": "A puppy and two cats together weigh 24 pounds. The puppy and the larger cat together weigh exactly twice as much as the smaller cat, and the puppy and the smaller cat together weigh exactly the same as the larger cat. How many pounds does the puppy weigh?",
    "solution": "Let the weight of the puppy be $a$, the weight of the smaller cat be $b$, and the weight of the larger cat be $c$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c&=24\\\\\na+c&=2b\\\\\na+b&=c\n\\end{align*} From Equation (2), we have $a=2b-c$. Substituting that into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b+c=24 \\Rightarrow b=8\n\\end{align*} Substituting $a=2b-c$ into Equation (3) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b&=c \\Rightarrow 3b=2c\n\\end{align*} Since $b=8$, $c=\\frac{3}{2}b=12$. Finally, substituting the values of $b$ and $c$ into Equation (1) to solve for $a$, we have $a+8+12=24$, or $a=4$. Thus, the puppy weighs $\\boxed{4}$ pounds.",

    "model_solution": "Let's denote the weight of the puppy as p, the weight of the larger cat as l, and the weight of the smaller cat as s.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that p + l + s = 24.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that p + l = 2s.\n\nFrom the third statement, we know that p + s = l.\n\nWe can use the third statement to substitute l in the first statement: \np + s + s = 24\np + 2s = 24\n\nNow, we can use the second statement to substitute p in the equation above:\nl = 2s\np = 2s - l\np = 2s - 2s\np = 0 + s (drop variable) does not help much, so let's just keep the l = 2s in mind and return to the p + 2s = 24.\n\nWe can also substitute l in the second statement:\n2s = l\n2s = p + l\n2s = p + 2s\np = 0 (drop variable) does not help much, but it tells us that p = s in this case.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\np + 2s = 24\np = s\n\nSubstituting p with s in the first equation:\ns + 2s = 24\n3s = 24\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\ns = 8\n\nNow, we know that p = s = 8.\n\nSo, the puppy weighs 8 pounds."
