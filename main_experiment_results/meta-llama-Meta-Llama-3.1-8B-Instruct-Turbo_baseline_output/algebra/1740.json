    "problem": "A box with a volume of 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold 50 paperclips. How many paperclips could a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ hold?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of paperclips that a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ could hold. Setting up the ratio $\\frac{50}{16}=\\frac{x}{48}$ and solving for $x$ gives $x=150$.  Hence, a 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ box could hold $\\boxed{150}$ paperclips.  We also could have noted that tripling the size of the box triples the number of paperclips we can hold, so the new box can hold $50\\cdot 3 = 150$ paperclips.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of paperclips that the second box can hold, we first need to find the ratio of the second box's volume to the first box's volume.\n\nThe first box has a volume of 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ and can hold 50 paperclips, so we can find the volume per paperclip as follows:\n\nVolume per paperclip = 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ / 50 paperclips = 0.32 $\\text{cm}^3$ per paperclip\n\nNow, we can find the number of paperclips that the second box can hold based on its volume, which is 48 $\\text{cm}^3$:\n\nNumber of paperclips = 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ / 0.32 $\\text{cm}^3$ per paperclip = 150 paperclips\n\nTherefore, the box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold 150 paperclips."
