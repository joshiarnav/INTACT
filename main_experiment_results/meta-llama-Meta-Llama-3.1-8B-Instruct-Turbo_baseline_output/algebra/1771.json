    "problem": "Two parabolas are the graphs of the equations $y=2x^2-7x+1$ and $y=8x^2+5x+1$. Give all points where they intersect.  List the points in order of increasing $x$-coordinate, separated by semicolons.",
    "solution": "First, set the two equations equal to each other to get $2x^2-7x+1=8x^2+5x+1$. Combine like terms to get $6x^2+12x=0$. Then, we can divide by $6$ to get $x^2+2x=0$. To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{2}\\right)^2=1$ to both sides, giving $(x+1)^2=1$.\n\nSo we have $x+1=\\pm1$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x=-2$ or $0$. Using these in our original parabolas, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-2, 23)}$ and $\\boxed{(0, 1)}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the points of intersection, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x. \n\nSetting the equations equal to each other:\n\n2x^2 - 7x + 1 = 8x^2 + 5x + 1\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\n6x^2 + 12x = 0\n\nDividing the entire equation by 6:\n\nx^2 + 2x = 0\n\nFactoring the equation:\n\nx(x + 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible values for x:\n\nx = 0 or x + 2 = 0, so x = -2\n\nNow that we have the x-values, we can substitute them back into one of the original equations to find the corresponding y-values.\n\nSubstituting x = 0 into y = 2x^2 - 7x + 1:\n\ny = 2(0)^2 - 7(0) + 1\ny = 1\n\nSubstituting x = -2 into y = 2x^2 - 7x + 1:\n\ny = 2(-2)^2 - 7(-2) + 1\ny = 8 + 14 + 1\ny = 23\n\nSo the points of intersection are (0, 1) and (-2, 23). In order of increasing x-coordinate, the points of intersection are -2,0."
