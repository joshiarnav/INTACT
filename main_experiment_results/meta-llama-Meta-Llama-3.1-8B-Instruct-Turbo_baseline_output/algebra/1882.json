The floor of 4.2 is 4, since it is the largest integer less than or equal to 4.2.\n\n2. The floor of -4.2 is -5, since it is the largest integer less than or equal to -4.2. The absolute value of -5 is 5.\n\nTherefore, the expression $\\lfloor |-4.2| \\rfloor + |\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor|$ is equal to $4 + 5 = 9.$"
