    "solution": "We can have $\\log_{10}10=1$ and $\\log_{10}100=2$.  Since $\\log_{10}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\\log_{10}10<\\log_{10}17<\\log_{10}100$, meaning $1<\\log_{10}17<2$.  Thus, the desired sum is $1+2=\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $\\log_{10}{17}$ between consecutive integers $a$ and $b$, we should first find the value of $\\log_{10}{10}$ and $\\log_{10}{100}$. \n\n$\\log_{10}{10} = 1$ since $10^1 = 10$.\n$\\log_{10}{100} = 2$ since $10^2 = 100$.\n\nNow that we know $\\log_{10}{10}$ is $1$ and $\\log_{10}{100}$ is $2$, $\\log_{10}{17}$ must be between $1$ and $2$ since $17$ is between $10$ and $100$. \n\nTo find $a + b$, we can simply add the two integers $1$ and $2$, which is equal to $3$."
