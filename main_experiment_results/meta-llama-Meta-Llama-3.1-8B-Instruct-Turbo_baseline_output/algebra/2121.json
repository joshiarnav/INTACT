    "problem": "Four primes $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ form an increasing arithmetic sequence with $a > 5$ and common difference 6. What is the ones digit of $a$?",
    "solution": "Every prime number greater than 5 has a ones digit of 1, 3, 7, or 9.  For each of these digits, let's add 6, take the resulting ones digit, and repeat the process two more times. We get the following sequences of digits. \\begin{align*}\n1, 7, 3, 9 \\\\\n3, 9, 5, 1 \\\\\n7, 3, 9, 5 \\\\\n9, 5, 1, 7\n\\end{align*} Only the first of these sequences could be the sequence of ones digits of four prime numbers, since each of the other three sequences contains 5.  Therefore, the units digit of $a$ is $\\boxed{1}$. The example $a=11$ shows that there exists such a sequence of consecutive prime numbers.",

    "model_solution": "Since the common difference is 6, and we are looking for the ones digit of 'a', we need to find a prime number which could be the possible ones digit for the prime number 'a'. \n\nPossible ones digits for a prime number greater than 5 are 1, 3, 7, and 9. \n\nNow, let's consider the possible ones digits for the consecutive prime numbers with a common difference of 6: \n\n- If the ones digit of 'a' is 1, the ones digit of 'b' will be 7 (since 1 + 6 = 7), 'c' will be 3 (7 + 6 = 13 and 3 is the ones digit), and 'd' will be 9 (3 + 6 = 9). But 13 is a prime number and the ones digit of 'd' cannot be 9 because 19 is a prime number. So, this option is not possible.\n\n- If the ones digit of 'a' is 3, the ones digit of 'b' will be 9 (since 3 + 6 = 9), 'c' will be 5 (9 + 6 = 15 and 5 is the ones digit), and 'd' will be 1 (5 + 6 = 11 and 1 is the ones digit). But 15 is not a prime number, so this option is not possible.\n\n- If the ones digit of 'a' is 7, the ones digit of 'b' will be 3 (since 7 + 6 = 13 and 3 is the ones digit), 'c' will be 9 (3 + 6 = 9), and 'd' will be 5 (9 + 6 = 15 and 5 is the ones digit). But 15 is not a prime number, so this option is not possible.\n\n- If the ones digit of 'a' is 9, the ones digit of 'b' will be 5 (since 9 + 6 = 15 and 5 is the ones digit), 'c' will be 1 (5 + 6 = 11 and 1 is the ones digit), and 'd' will be 7 (1 + 6 = 7). So, this option is possible.\n\nTherefore, the possible ones digit of 'a' is 9."
