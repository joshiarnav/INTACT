    "problem": "Find $A$ and $B$ such that\n\\[\\frac{5x+2}{x^2-7x-30}=\\frac{A}{x-10}+\\frac{B}{x+3}.\\]Write your answer in the form $(A,B)$.",
    "solution": "We factor the denominator in the left-hand side to get \\[\\frac{5x+2}{(x-10)(x+3)}= \\frac{A}{x - 10} + \\frac{B}{x + 3}.\\]We then multiply both sides by $(x - 10)(x + 3)$, to get \\[5x + 2 = A(x + 3) + B(x - 10).\\]We can solve for $A$ and $B$ by substituting suitable values of $x$.  For example, setting $x = 10$, the equation becomes $52 = 13A$, so $A = 4$.  Setting $x = -3$, the equation becomes $-13 = -13B$, so $B = 1$.  Therefore, $(A,B) = \\boxed{(4,1)}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the values of $A$ and $B$, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by the denominator of the right-hand side, which is $(x-10)(x+3) = x^2 - 7x - 30$. This will eliminate the fractions and allow us to solve for $A$ and $B$.\n\nMultiplying both sides by $x^2 - 7x - 30$, we get:\n\n\\[5x + 2 = A(x + 3) + B(x - 10).\\]\n\nNow, we can expand the right-hand side and rearrange the terms:\n\n\\[5x + 2 = Ax + 3A + Bx - 10B.\\]\n\nGrouping like terms, we get:\n\n\\[5x + 2 = (A + B)x + (3A - 10B).\\]\n\nSince this equation must be true for all values of $x$, we can equate the coefficients of the $x$ terms on both sides:\n\n\\[A + B = 5.\\]\n\nWe can also equate the constant terms on both sides:\n\n\\[3A - 10B = 2.\\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nA + B &= 5, \\\\\n3A - 10B &= 2.\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\nWe can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. If we multiply the first equation by 3 and add it to the second equation, we get:\n\n\\[3(A + B) + (3A - 10B) = 3(5) + 2,\\]\n\\[3A + 3B + 3A - 10B = 15 + 2,\\]\n\\[6A - 7B = 17.\\]\n\nHowever, we do not need this final equation. We already have enough. \n\nMultiplying the first equation by 3 gives us:\n\\[3A + 3B = 15.\\]\n\nWe can then subtract this equation from the second equation to solve for B:\n\n\\[(3A - 10B) - (3A + 3B) = 2 - 15,\\]\n\\[-10B - 3B = -13.\\]\n\nCombining like terms gives:\n\\[-13B = -13.\\]\n\nDividing both sides by -13 gives:\n\\[B = 1.\\]\n\nWe can then plug this value of B into the first equation to solve for A:\n\n\\[A + 1 = 5,\\]\n\\[A = 5 - 1,\\]\n\\[A = 4.\\]\n\nTherefore, the values of A and B are $(A, B) = \\boxed{(4, 1)}$."
