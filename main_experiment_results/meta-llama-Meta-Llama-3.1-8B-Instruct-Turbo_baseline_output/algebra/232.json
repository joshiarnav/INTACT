    "problem": "A 1$\\%$ late charge was added to Jenna's bill on the $30^{\\text{th}}$ day past its due date. The resulting total was then increased by 1$\\%$ because she did not pay the bill in the next 30 days either. Her original bill was $\\$400$. Exactly how much is the bill now?",
    "solution": "The first late charge brings the bill to $400 \\cdot 1.01 = 400 + 4 = 404$. The second late charge brings the bill to $404 \\cdot 1.01 = 404 + 4.04 = \\boxed{408.04}$ dollars.\n\n-OR-\n\nEach increase multiples the bill by $1+1\\%=1.01$. Therefore, her final bill is $\\$400(1.01)^2=\\$408.04$.",

    "model_solution": "Jenna paid 1% late charge on her original bill of $\\$400$. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate 1% of $\\$400$. Since 1% is the same as $\\frac{1}{100}$, we can multiply $\\$400$ by $\\frac{1}{100}$ to find the late charge amount. \n\n$400 \\times \\frac{1}{100} = 4$.\n\nAdding the late charge to the original bill, we get:\n\n$400 + 4 = \\$404$.\n\nNext, 1% late charge was added to the new total of $\\$404$.\n\nWe need to calculate 1% of $\\$404$. Again, 1% is the same as $\\frac{1}{100}$.\n\n$404 \\times \\frac{1}{100} = 0.00404 \\times 100 = 4.04$ ( rounded to two decimal places) \n\nAdding the late charge to the new total of $\\$404$, we get:\n\n$404 + 4.04 = \\$408.04$.\n\nThe new total bill is $\\$408.04$."
