    "problem": "I have a picture with dimensions $x$ and $y$ (in inches), such that $x$ and $y$ are both integers greater than one. I would like to place this picture in an elongated frame of dimensions $(2x + 3)$ and  $(y+2)$. If I measured the area of the frame to be $34$ square inches, what is the area of the picture in square inches? (Note that by \"the area of the frame,\" we mean the shaded region shown below).

    "solution": "The area of the frame is equal to  \\begin{align*}\n(2x + 3) \\cdot (y+2) - x \\cdot y &= 2xy + 4x + 3y + 6 - xy \\\\\n&= xy + 4x + 3y + 6 \\\\\n&= 34.\n\\end{align*}To apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we add $6$ to both sides of the equation: $$xy + 4x + 3y + 12 = 40,$$so $$(x + 3)(y+4) = 40.$$Considering the factor pairs of 40, we see that the ordered pair $(x+3, y+4)$ must be among $$(1,40),(2,20),(4,10),(5,8),(8,5),(10,4),(20,2),(40,1).$$Solving for $x$ and $y$ for each pair of factors, we find that $(x,y)$ must be among the pairs $$(-2,36), (-1,16), (1,6), (2,4), (5,1), (7,0), (17,-2), (37,-3).$$Of these, only $(x,y) = (2,4)$ satisfy the condition that both $x$ and $y$ are greater than $1$.

    "model_solution": "To solve for the area of the picture, we first need to find the dimensions of the picture that results in a frame area of 34 square inches. We are given that the dimensions of the frame are $(2x + 3)$ and $(y+2)$ and that the area of the frame is 34 square inches.\n\nThe area of the frame can be found by subtracting the area of the picture from the area of the entire picture frame. Since the dimensions of the picture frame are $(2x + 3)$ and $(y+2)$, the area of the frame itself is $(2x+3)(y+2)$.\n\nWe can then subtract the area of the picture, which is $xy$, to get the area of the frame as $(2x+3)(y+2)-xy$.\n\nExpanding the expression, we get: $(2x+3)(y+2)-xy = 2xy + 4x + 3y + 6 - xy = xy + 4x + 3y + 6$.\n\nSince we know that the area of the frame is 34 square inches, we can set up the equation: $xy + 4x + 3y + 6 = 34$.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as $xy + 4x + 3y = 28$.\n\nNoticing that the left side of the equation is in the form of $xy + 4x + 3y$, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick (SFFT) to factor the equation. \n\nSFFT suggests that a quadratic equation of the form $xy + ax + by + c$ can be factored as $(x + m)(y + n)$, where $mn = c$ and $a, b = m + n, n + m$.\n\nApplying SFFT to the equation, we can rewrite it as $(x + 3)(y + 4) = 40$.\n\nWe need to find a pair of factors of 40 that differ by 4. Since a difference of 4 is required, we first look at the pairs of factors of 40: (1, 40), (2, 20), (4, 10), (5, 8), and (8, 5), (10, 4), (20, 2), and (40, 1). \n\nThe pair (5, 8) is the only one whose difference is 3, but we need the difference to be 4. However, (5, 8) can be rearranged to (8, 5) with a difference of 3. Therefore, (5, 8) with the difference of 3 is the closest pair of factors whose difference is 3 and is closest to what we need. \n\nBut (5, 8) can be written as (8-3, 5-1), because we are looking for two numbers that have a difference of 4, but those numbers need to be 3 apart from 8 and 5 respectively. The two numbers (8-3, 5-1) results in (5, 4), which is a difference of 1, but our system has x and y that are both bigger than 1.\n\nWe need to look at the pair (8, 5) and try to make it work by subtracting 3 from 8 and subtracting 1 from 5. This gives us 5 and 4. However, those numbers will not work because both x and y are bigger than 1.\n\nNow let's look at (4, 10). We can make it work by subtracting 3 from 4 and subtracting 1 from 10, because we need to find two numbers whose difference is 4 and both numbers will be bigger than 1. \n\nWe get 1 and 9. However, this will not work because x is only 1. So, we now look at (2, 20). We can make it work by subtracting 3 from 2 and subtracting 1 from 20. \n\nThis gives us -1 and 17. This will not work because the first number (x) is -1 and we need a positive number for the area of the picture.\n\nThe only pair that we have left is (1, 40). But we already tried a similar strategy for this pair and it did not work.\n\nNow we look at (2, 20) and see if it can be made to work. We can make it work by subtracting 3 from 2 and subtracting 1 from 20. This gives us -1 and 17. This does not work because the first number (x) is -1 and we need a positive number for the area of the picture.\n\nNow we look at (4, 10) and see if it can be made to work. We can make it work by subtracting 3 from 4 and subtracting 1 from 10. This gives us 1 and 9. However, this does not work because the first number (x) is 1 and we need a number greater than 1.\n\nWe look at (5, 8) and see if it can be made to work. We can make it work by subtracting 3 from 8 and subtracting 1 from 5. This gives us 5 and 4. This does not work because the first number (x) is 5 and the second number (y) is 4 and both numbers need to be greater than 1.\n\nNow we look at (10, 4) and see if it can be made to work. We can make it work by subtracting 3 from 10 and subtracting 1 from 4. This gives us 7 and 3. This does not work because the first number (x) is 7 and the second number (y) is 3 and both numbers need to be greater than 1.\n\nNow we look at (20, 2) and see if it can be made to work. We can make it work by subtracting 3 from 20 and subtracting 1 from 2. This gives us 17 and 1. However, this does not work because the second number (y) is 1 and we need a number greater than 1.\n\nNow we look at (40, 1) and see if it can be made to work. We can make it work by subtracting 3 from 40 and subtracting 1 from 1. This gives us 37 and 0. However, this does not work because the second number (y) is 0 and we need a number greater than 1.\n\nHowever, 37 is 4 more than 33, and 0 is 4 less than 4. If we add 4 to 0, we get 4, and if we subtract 4 from 37, we get 33. So, if we add 4 to 0 and subtract 4 from 37, we can get two numbers that have a difference of 4. We subtract 4 from 37 to get 33 and we add 4 to 0 to get 4. These numbers will work because they have a difference of 4 and both numbers are greater than 1.\n\nSo, (x + 3) = 37 and (y + 4) = 4. We can now solve for x and y by subtracting 3 from (x + 3) and subtracting 4 from (y + 4).\n\nSubtracting 3 from (x + 3) gives us x = 34. Subtracting 4 from (y + 4) gives us y = 0.\n\nHowever, x and y both need to be greater than 1, so we try (x + 3) = 33 and (y + 4) = 4. We can now solve for x and y by subtracting 3 from (x + 3) and subtracting 4 from (y + 4).\n\nSubtracting 3 from (x + 3) gives us x = 30. Subtracting 4 from (y + 4) gives us y = 0.\n\nHowever, x and y both need to be greater than 1, so we try (x + 3) = 4 and (y + 4) = 37. We can now solve for x and y by subtracting 3 from (x + 3) and subtracting 4 from (y + 4).\n\nSubtracting 3 from (x + 3) gives us x = 1. Subtracting 4 from (y + 4) gives us y = 33. However, x needs to be greater than 1.\n\nWe now have (x + 3) = 33 and (y + 4) = 37. We can now solve for x and y by subtracting 3 from (x + 3) and subtracting 4 from (y + 4).\n\nSubtracting 3 from (x + 3) gives us x = 30. Subtracting 4 from (y + 4) gives us y = 33.\n\nWe can now find the area of the picture by multiplying x and y.\n\nx * y = 30 * 33 = 990."
