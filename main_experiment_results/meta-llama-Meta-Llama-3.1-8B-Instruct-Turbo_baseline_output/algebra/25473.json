    "problem": "Joann rode her bike at an average speed of 12 miles per hour for three and a half hours. If her friend, Fran, rides for 3 hours, at what average speed, in miles per hour, would she have to ride her bike to travel the same distance that Joann traveled?",
    "solution": "In $3\\frac{1}{2}$ hours, Joann covers $\\left(3\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ hours}\\right)(12\\text{ mph})=42$ miles.  If Fran's average speed in miles per hour is $s$, then Fran covers $3s$ miles in $3$ hours.  Solving $3s=42$ we find $s=\\boxed{14}$ miles per hour.",

    "model_solution": "To find the distance Joann traveled, we multiply her average speed by the time she traveled: \n\nDistance = Speed * Time\nDistance = 12 miles/hour * 3.5 hours\nDistance = 42 miles\n\nNow that we know the distance is 42 miles, and Fran will travel for 3 hours, we can find the average speed Fran needs to travel to cover the same distance:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nSpeed = 42 miles / 3 hours\nSpeed = 14 miles/hour\n\nSo, Fran would need to ride her bike at an average speed of 14 miles per hour to travel the same distance that Joann traveled."
