    "problem": "If $a$ is a constant such that $4x^2 + 14x + a$ is the square of a binomial, then what is $a$?",
    "solution": "If $4x^2 + 14x + a$  is the square of a binomial, then the binomial has the form $2x +b$ for some number $b$, because $(2x)^2 = 4x^2$.  So, we compare $(2x+b)^2$ to $4x^2 + 14x + a$. Expanding $(2x+b)^2$ gives \\[(2x+b)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2(2x)(b) + b^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2.\\] Equating the linear term of this to the linear term of $4x^2+14x+a$, we have $4bx=14x$, so $b=\\frac{14}{4}=\\frac{7}{2}$. Squaring the binomial gives $\\left(2x+\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2=4x^2+14x+\\frac{49}{4}$. Therefore, $a=\\boxed{\\frac{49}{4}}$.",

    "model_solution": "If $4x^2 + 14x + a$ is the square of a binomial, then it must be of the form $(2x + b)^2$ where $b$ is a constant. \n\nWe can expand this as follows:\n$(2x + b)^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2$\n\nWe want this to be equal to $4x^2 + 14x + a$.  Therefore, we must have that $4bx = 14x$.  Dividing both sides of this equation by $4x$, we get $b = \\frac{14}{4} = \\frac{7}{2}$.\n\nWe also know that $b^2 = a$.  Therefore, we have $a = \\left( \\frac{7}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{49}{4}.$"
