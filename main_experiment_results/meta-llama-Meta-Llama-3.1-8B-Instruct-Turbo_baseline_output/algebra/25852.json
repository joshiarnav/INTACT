    "problem": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the two distinct solutions to the equation $$\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15}=x+2.$$If $p > q$, what is the value of $p - q$?",
    "solution": "First we try factoring the left side to simplify it: $$\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15}=\\frac{4(x-3)}{(x-3)(x+5)}=\\frac{4}{x+5}.$$Now we can multiply both sides by $(x+5)$ and solve for $x$: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{4}{x+5}&=x+2\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n4&=(x+5)(x+2)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=x^2+7x+10\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=x^2+7x+6\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=(x+6)(x+1).\n\\end{align*}So $p=-1$ and $q=-6$, making $p-q=\\boxed{5}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the solutions to the equation, first, we should multiply both sides of the equation by $x^2 + 2x - 15$.\n\nThe equation is $$\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15}=x+2.$$ \n\nMultiplying both sides by $x^2 + 2x - 15$ gives us:\n$$4x-12=(x+2)(x^2+2x-15).$$\n\nNow, let's expand the right-hand side of the equation:\n$$(x+2)(x^2+2x-15) = x^3+2x^2-15x+2x^2+4x-30.$$\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n$$x^3+4x^2-x-30.$$ \n\nNow our equation is \n$$4x-12=x^3+4x^2-x-30.$$\n\nSubtracting $4x - 12$ from both sides, we get:\n$$0=x^3+4x^2-x-30-4x+12.$$\n\nThis simplifies to \n$$0=x^3+4x^2-5x-18.$$\n\nNow we have a cubic equation and we need to find the roots of this equation. The roots are the values of $x$ for which the equation is equal to $0$. \n\nUsing the rational root theorem, we can find the possible roots of the equation. \n\nSince the constant term of the equation is $-18$, we know that the possible roots must be the divisors of $-18$. \n\nThe divisors of $-18$ are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6, \\pm 9,$ and $\\pm 18$.\n\nNow, we need to find which of these possible roots actually satisfy the equation. \n\nThe possible roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6, \\pm 9,$ and $\\pm 18$. \n\nNow we can substitute each of these values into the equation and see which ones work. \n\nSince we are looking for two distinct solutions, we can start by trying the smallest values.\n\nIf we let $x=1$, the equation becomes:\n$$0=1+4-5-18=-18.$$\n\nSince this is not equal to $0$, $x=1$ is not a root.\n\nIf we let $x=-1$, the equation becomes:\n$$0=-1+4+5-18=-10.$$ \n\nSince this is not equal to $0$, $x=-1$ is not a root.\n\nIf we let $x=2$, the equation becomes:\n$$0=8+16-10-18=-4.$$ \n\nSince this is not equal to $0$, $x=2$ is not a root.\n\nIf we let $x=-2$, the equation becomes:\n$$0=-8+16+10-18=0.$$ \n\nThis means that $x=-2$ is a root.\n\nIf we let $x=3$, the equation becomes:\n$$0=27+36-15-18=30.$$ \n\nSince this is not equal to $0$, $x=3$ is not a root.\n\nIf we let $x=-3$, the equation becomes:\n$$0=-27+36+15-18=6.$$ \n\nSince this is not equal to $0$, $x=-3$ is not a root.\n\nIf we let $x=6$, the equation becomes:\n$$0=216+144-30-18=372.$$ \n\nSince this is not equal to $0$, $x=6$ is not a root.\n\nIf we let $x=-6$, the equation becomes:\n$$0=-216+144+30-18=-60.$$ \n\nSince this is not equal to $0$, $x=-6$ is not a root.\n\nIf we let $x=9$, the equation becomes:\n$$0=729+324-45-18=990.$$ \n\nSince this is not equal to $0$, $x=9$ is not a root.\n\nIf we let $x=-9$, the equation becomes:\n$$0=-729+324+45-18=-378.$$ \n\nSince this is not equal to $0$, $x=-9$ is not a root.\n\nIf we let $x=18$, the equation becomes:\n$$0=5832+1296-90-18=6030.$$ \n\nSince this is not equal to $0$, $x=18$ is not a root.\n\nIf we let $x=-18$, the equation becomes:\n$$0=-5832+1296+90-18=-4464.$$ \n\nSince this is not equal to $0$, $x=-18$ is not a root.\n\nIf we let $x=-2$, we already found that this is a root.\n\nNow, we need to find the other root. \n\nWe can do this by factoring the equation. \n\nThe equation is $$0=x^3+4x^2-5x-18.$$\n\nSince we know that one of the roots is $x=-2$, we can try to factor the equation by grouping. \n\nFirst, we can group the first two terms and the last two terms:\n$$0=(x^3+4x^2)+(-5x-18).$$\n\nNow, we can factor out the greatest common factor from each group:\n$$0=x^2(x+4)-5(x+4).$$\n\nNow, we can factor out the common factor $(x+4)$:\n$$0=(x^2-5)(x+4).$$\n\nThe roots of this equation are $x=-4$ and $x=\\pm\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nSince the roots are $x=-4$ and $x=\\pm\\sqrt{5}$, and we know that $x=-2$ is one of the roots, we can conclude that the other root is $x=-4$.\n\nSince we know that $p>q$, we can conclude that $p=-2$ and $q=-4$. \n\nNow, we can find the value of $p-q$. \n\nThe value of $p-q$ is equal to $-2-(-4)$, which is equal to $-2+4$, which is equal to $2$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $p-q$ is $\\boxed{2}$."
