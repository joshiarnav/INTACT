    "problem": "The third and fourth terms of a geometric sequence are 12 and 16, respectively. What is the first term of the sequence?",
    "solution": "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence. Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$. Solving, we have $a\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",

    "model_solution": "In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio (r). \n\nWe are given that the third term is 12 and the fourth term is 16. \n\nLet's find the common ratio first. We know that the fourth term is the third term multiplied by the common ratio. \n\n16 = 12 * r \n\nTo find the common ratio (r), we divide both sides by 12.\n\nr = 16 / 12 \nr = 4/3 \n\nNow that we know the common ratio (r), we can find the first term of the sequence. \n\nThe first term (a) multiplied by the common ratio (r) should give us the second term. However, we know the third term is 12. \n\nSo, to find the first term (a), we work backwards from the third term. \n\na * r^2 = 12 \n\nWe know that r = 4/3. \n\na * (4/3)^2 = 12 \n\na * (16/9) = 12 \n\nTo find a, we divide both sides by 16/9.\n\na = 12 / (16/9) \na = 12 * (9/16) \na = 108 / 16 \na = 27 / 4 \n\nSo, the first term of the sequence is 27/4."
