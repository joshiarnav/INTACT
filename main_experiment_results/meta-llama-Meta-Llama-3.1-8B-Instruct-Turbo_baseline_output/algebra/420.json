    "model_solution": "To simplify the expression, we'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1. Multiply the terms:\n   - $5(3-i)$ = $15-5i$\n   - $3i(5-i)$ = $15i-3i^2$\n\n2. Now, let's recall that $i^2$ = -1. Replace $i^2$ in the expression:\n   - $15i-3i^2$ = $15i-3(-1)$ = $15i+3$\n\n3. Combine like terms:\n   - $15-5i+15i+3$ = $18+10i$\n\nSo, the simplified expression is $18+10i$."
