    "problem": "What is the greatest integer $x$ such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime?",
    "solution": "We can factor the quadratic $6x^2-47x+15$ as $(2x-15)(3x-1)$. So we have $|6x^2-47x+15|=|(2x-15)(3x-1)|=|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|$. In order for $|6x^2-47x+15|$ to be prime, its only divisors must be $1$ and itself. Thus one of $|2x-15|$ or $|3x-1|$ must be equal to $1$.\n\nIf $|3x-1|=1$, then $3x-1=1$ or $3x-1=-1$. These equations yield $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $x=0$, respectively. We throw out $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ since it is not an integer, and keep $x=0$ as a candidate.\n\nIf $|2x-15|=1$, then $2x-15=1$, in which case $2x=16$ and $x=8$, or $2x-15=-1$, in which case $2x=14$ and $x=7$.\n\nThus our candidates for the greatest $x$ are $0, 7$, and $8$. It remains to check whether the other factor is prime. We first check $x=8$. Since $|2x-15|=1$, we know $|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|=|3x-1|=|24-1|=23$, which is prime. Thus $\\boxed{8}$ is the largest integer for which $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime.",

    "model_solution": "To find the greatest integer $x$ such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime, we first need to factorize the expression $6x^2-47x+15$. \n\nWe can factorize the quadratic expression $6x^2-47x+15$ as:\n\n$6x^2-47x+15$ $= (2x-3)(3x-5)$\n\nNow, $|6x^2-47x+15|$ $= |(2x-3)(3x-5)|$.\n\nWe need to find the greatest integer $x$ such that $|(2x-3)(3x-5)|$ is prime. $|(2x-3)(3x-5)|$ is prime if and only if one of $(2x-3)$ or $(3x-5)$ is equal to $1$ or $-1$, and the other one is a prime number.\n\nWe can write the following cases:\n\n- Case 1: $(2x-3) = 1$ and $(3x-5)$ is a prime number.\n- Case 2: $(2x-3) = -1$ and $(3x-5)$ is a prime number.\n- Case 3: $(2x-3)$ is a prime number and $(3x-5) = 1$.\n- Case 4: $(2x-3)$ is a prime number and $(3x-5) = -1$.\n\nNow, let's solve each case:\n\n- Case 1: $(2x-3) = 1$ $\\implies 2x = 4$ $\\implies x = 2$ and $(3x-5)$ is a prime number. \n$(3x-5)$ $= (3 \\cdot 2 - 5) $ $= 1$, which is not a prime number.
