    "problem": "Given positive integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x\\neq y$ and $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{18}$, what is the smallest possible value for $x + y$?",
    "solution": "Simplifying, we have  $18(x+y)=xy$, so $xy - 18x - 18y = 0$ Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick by adding 324 to both sides, we get $xy-18x-18y +324=324$, so \\[(x-18)(y-18)=324.\\]Now we seek the minimal $x+y,$ which occurs when $x-18$ and $y-18$ are as close to each other in value as possible. The two best candidates are $(x-18,y-18)=(12,27)$ or $(9,36),$ of which $(x,y)=(30,45)$ attains the minimum sum of $\\boxed{75}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest possible value for $x + y$, we can start by manipulating the given equation.\n\nGiven that $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{18}$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $18xy$ to obtain:\n\\begin{align*}\n18xy \\left( \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} \\right) &= 18xy \\left( \\frac{1}{18} \\right) \\\\\n18y + 18x &= xy \\\\\nxy - 18x - 18y &= 0.\n\\end{align*}\nWe can now try to factor the left-hand side of the equation by grouping.\n\\begin{align*}\nxy - 18x - 18y &= 0 \\\\\nxy - 18x &= 18y \\\\\nx(y - 18) &= 18y \\\\\nx &= \\frac{18y}{y-18}.\n\\end{align*}\nSince we want to minimize the value of $x + y$, we want to minimize $y$ as well. However, since $y$ cannot be $18$ (because $x \\neq y$), the smallest value $y$ can take is $19$.\n\nSubstituting $y = 19$ into our expression for $x$, we have that:\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{18y}{y - 18} \\\\\nx &= \\frac{18(19)}{19 - 18} \\\\\nx &= \\frac{18(19)}{1} \\\\\nx &= 342.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the smallest possible value for $x + y$ is $342 + 19 = 361$."
