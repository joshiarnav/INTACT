    "problem": "Suppose $x$ and $y$ are integers such that  $xy+5x+4y=-5$.  Find the greatest possible value of $y$.",
    "solution": "Note that $(x+4)(y+5)$ equals $xy+5x+4y+20$.  So, add $20$ to both sides of the original equation to get $xy+5x+4y+20=15$, so now we may apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and write the equation as $(x+4)(y+5)=15$.\n\nThen, the potential ordered pairs $((x+4),(y+5))$ with $x<y$ are $(-15,-1)$, $(-5,-3)$, $(1,15)$ and $(3,5)$, since these are the pairs of integers that multiply to 15.  The greatest value for $y+5$ is thus $15$.  We solve $y+5=15$ for $y$ to yield $y=\\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, which involves manipulating the equation to create a factorable expression. \n\nFirst, we add 20 to both sides of the equation:\n$xy + 5x + 4y + 20 = 15$\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$(x+4)(y+5) = 15$\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are integers, $(x+4)$ and $(y+5)$ must be factors of 15. \n\nThe factors of 15 are $\\{1, 15\\}$, $\\{3, 5\\}$. \n\nNow, we need to find the possible values of $(y+5)$ by considering the factors of 15. We have two cases:\n\nCase 1: $(x+4) = 1$, $(y+5) = 15$\n$y+5 = 15 \\implies y = 10$\n\nCase 2: $(x+4) = 3$, $(y+5) = 5$\n$y+5 = 5 \\implies y = 0$\n\nCase 3: $(x+4) = 5$, $(y+5) = 3$\n$y+5 = 3 \\implies y = -2$\n\nCase 4: $(x+4) = 15$, $(y+5) = 1$\n$y+5 = 1 \\implies y = -4$\n\nTo find the greatest possible value of $y$, we select the greatest value from the set $\\{-4, 0, -2, 10\\}$, which is $10$. Therefore, the greatest possible value of $y$ is 10."
