    "problem": "Alex has 12 friends and 63 coins. What is the minimum number of additional coins he needs so that he can give each friend at least one coin and no two friends receive the same number of coins?",
    "solution": "Alex wants to minimize the number of coins he gives to his friends without giving any two of them the same number of coins. The minimum number of coins he can give to a friend is 1. He then gives 2 coins to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 12. The total number of coins Alex has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+12 = \\frac{12 \\cdot 13}{2}=78$.  Thus, Alex needs $78-63=\\boxed{15}$ more coins.",

    "model_solution": "To find the minimum number of additional coins Alex needs, we need to calculate the total number of coins he should have to give each friend at least one coin and no two friends receive the same number of coins.\n\nThe sequence of coins he can distribute to his friends is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.\n\nTo find the sum of this sequence, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nSum = (n * (a1 + an)) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\n\nIn this case, n = 12, a1 = 1, and an = 12.\n\nSum = (12 * (1 + 12)) / 2\n= (12 * 13) / 2\n= 156 / 2\n= 78\n\nSince Alex has 63 coins, he needs at least 78 - 63 = 15 additional coins.\n\nTherefore, Alex needs a minimum of 15 additional coins to distribute them to his friends as desired."
