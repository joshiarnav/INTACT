    "problem": "The product of two positive integers plus their sum is 103. The integers are relatively prime, and each is less than 20. What is the sum of the two integers?",
    "solution": "Let our numbers be $a$ and $b$ with $a>b.$ Then $ab+a+b=103$. With Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick in mind, we add $1$ to both sides and get $ab+a+b+1 = 104$, which factors as $(a+1)(b+1)=104$. We consider pairs $(a+1, b+1)$ of factors of $104$: $(104,1), (52,2), (26,4), (13,8)$. Since $a<20$, we can rule out the first 3 pairs, which gives $a=12$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\\boxed{19}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's denote the two positive integers as x and y. Since they are relatively prime, they have no common factors other than 1. \n\nGiven that the product of the two integers plus their sum is 103, we can form the following equation:\n\nxy + x + y = 103\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\nxy + x + y + 1 = 104\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n(x + 1)(y + 1) = 104\n\nNow we need to find the factors of 104 that are less than 21 and relatively prime. The factors of 104 are:\n\n(1, 104), (2, 52), (4, 26), (8, 13)\n\nSince x and y are less than 20, the only possible pair is (8, 13). \n\nNow we can find x and y by subtracting 1 from each factor:\n\nx + 1 = 8 => x = 7\ny + 1 = 13 => y = 12\n\nThe sum of the two integers is x + y = 7 + 12 = 19.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the two integers is 19."
