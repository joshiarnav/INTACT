    "solution": "The number of squares in the rectangles is an arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference 1. Thus, at Stage 6, there will be 6 squares. Since each square has an area of $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ square inches, the total area of the rectangle at Stage 6 is $6 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{54}$ square inches.",

    "model_solution": "At Stage 1, the total area of the rectangle is 3 * 3 = 9 square inches. \n\nAt Stage 2, a 3'' by 3'' square is added to the right of the initial square, so the total area is 9 + 9 = 18 square inches. \n\nIn general, the total area at Stage n is 9n square inches. \n\nAt Stage 6, the total area of the rectangle is 9 * 6 = 54 square inches.\n\nThe answer is 54."
