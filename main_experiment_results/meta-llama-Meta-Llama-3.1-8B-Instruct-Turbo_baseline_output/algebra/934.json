    "problem": "The graph of a certain quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertex $(-4,0)$ which passes through the point $(1,-75)$.  What is the value of $a$?",
    "solution": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic must be of the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$.  The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, which gives us the equation $-75 = 25a$.  Hence, $a = -75/25 = \\boxed{-3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $a$, we can use the information given about the vertex and the point it passes through. \n\nThe vertex form of a parabola is given by $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex. Since the vertex is $(-4, 0)$, the equation can be written as:\n\n$y = a(x - (-4))^2 + 0$\n$y = a(x + 4)^2$\n\nWe know that the parabola passes through the point $(1, -75)$. Substituting $x = 1$ and $y = -75$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$-75 = a(1 + 4)^2$\n$-75 = a(5)^2$\n$-75 = 25a$\n\nTo find the value of $a$, we can divide both sides by $25$:\n\n$a = -75 / 25$\n$a = -3$\n\nSo, the value of $a$ is $-3$."
