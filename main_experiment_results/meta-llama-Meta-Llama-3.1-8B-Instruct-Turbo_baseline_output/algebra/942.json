    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the first six terms of this geometric sequence, we need to find the common ratio (r) and the first term (a). \n\nThe given sequence is $\\frac12,\\frac14,\\frac18,\\dots$. We can see that to get from the first term to the second term, we multiply by $\\frac14$. So the common ratio is $\\frac14$. \n\nThe first term (a) is $\\frac12$. \n\nNow we can use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence: \n\nS_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nwhere S_n is the sum of the first n terms, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nPlugging in the values we have: \nS_6 = $\\frac12$ * (1 - $(\\frac14)^6$) / (1 - $\\frac14$)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we have: \nS_6 = $\\frac12$ * (1 - $\\frac1{4096}$) / ($\\frac34$)\n\nTo simplify this, we need to find a common denominator for 1 and $\\frac1{4096}$, which is 4096. Then: \nS_6 = $\\frac12$ * ($\\frac{4095}{4096}$) / ($\\frac34$)\n\nTo divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal: \nS_6 = $\\frac12$ * ($\\frac{4095}{4096}$) * ($\\frac43$)\n\nMultiplying the numerators and denominators, we have: \nS_6 = $\\frac{4095}{3}$ * ($\\frac1{4096}$)\n\nMultiplying the numerators and denominators, we have: \nS_6 = $\\frac{4095}{12288}$"
