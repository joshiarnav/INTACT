    "problem": "We flip a fair coin 10 times.  What is the probability that we get heads in exactly 8 of the 10 flips?",
    "solution": "There are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible outcomes of the 10 coin flips. There are $\\binom{10}{8}=\\binom{10}{2}=45$ ways to get exactly 8 heads, so the probability is $\\dfrac{45}{2^{10}}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{45}{1024}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability of getting heads exactly 8 times in 10 flips, we need to use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nWhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, heads) in n trials (in this case, 10 flips)\n- n is the number of trials (10 flips)\n- k is the number of successes (8 heads)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (getting heads on a single flip, which is 1/2 or 0.5, since the coin is fair)\n- q is the probability of failure on a single trial (getting tails on a single flip, which is also 1/2 or 0.5)\n\nThe number of combinations of 10 items taken 8 at a time is:\nnCk = 10C8 = 10! / (8! * (10-8)!) = 45\n\nNow we can plug in the values:\nP(X = 8) = 45 * (0.5^8) * (0.5^(10-8))\n= 45 * (0.5^8) * (0.5^2)\n= 45 * (0.5^10)\n= 45 * (1/1024)\n= 45/1024\n\nSo, the probability of getting heads exactly 8 times in 10 flips is 45/1024 or approximately 0.043945."
