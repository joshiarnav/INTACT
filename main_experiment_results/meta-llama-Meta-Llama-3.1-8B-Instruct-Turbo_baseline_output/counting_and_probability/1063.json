    "problem": "How many distinct sequences of four letters can be made from the letters in EQUALS if each sequence must begin with L, end with Q, and no letter can appear in a sequence more than once?",
    "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",

    "model_solution": "To create a sequence of four letters from the letters in \"EQUALS\" with the given conditions, we need to analyze the number of choices for each position.\n\n1. The first letter must be 'L' (1 choice).\n2. The last letter must be 'Q' (1 choice).\n3. The second letter can be any of the remaining 4 letters ('E', 'A', 'U', or 'S') (4 choices).\n4. The third letter can be any of the remaining 3 letters (excluding the second letter and 'L' and 'Q') (3 choices).\n\nTo find the total number of distinct sequences, we multiply the number of choices for each position:\n\n1 (choice for first letter) * 4 (choices for second letter) * 3 (choices for third letter) * 1 (choice for last letter) = 12\n\nTherefore, there are 12 distinct sequences of four letters that can be made from the letters in \"EQUALS\" with the given conditions."
