    "problem": "In how many ways can 8 people be seated in a row of chairs if three of the people, John, Wilma, and Paul, refuse to sit in three consecutive seats?",
    "solution": "The number of all seating arrangements is $8!$. The number of seating arrangements in which John, Wilma and Paul sit next to each other is $6!\\times 3!$. We can arrive at $6!\\times 3!$ by considering John, Wilma and Paul as one person, arranging the ``six'' people (the JWP super-person plus the 5 other people) first, then arranging John, Wilma and Paul.  Thus the number of acceptable arrangements is $$8!-6!\\times 3!=8\\times 7\\times 6! - 6!\\times 3! = (8\\times 7 - 3!)6! = (50)(720)=\\boxed{36000}.$$",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into two cases.\n\nCase 1: John, Wilma, and Paul sit together in three consecutive seats.\nIn this case, we can treat them as a single unit (or block), and arrange this block along with the remaining 5 people. There are 6 possible positions for this block (at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end).\n\n- Arrange the block and the remaining 5 people: 6! ways\n- Arrange John, Wilma, and Paul within the block: 3! ways (3! = 6)\n\nThe total number of ways in this case is 6 * 6! * 3! = 51840.\n\nCase 2: John, Wilma, and Paul do not sit in three consecutive seats.\nIn this case, we'll calculate the total number of arrangements for 8 people, and then subtract the number of arrangements where they sit together.\n\n- Total number of arrangements for 8 people: 8! = 40320\n- We already calculated the number of arrangements where John, Wilma, and Paul sit together: 51840 (this is not correct as we have counted some cases multiple times, we will use (40320 * 3!) below instead)\n\nHowever, in our previous calculation we counted some cases multiple times (for example, the order A-B-C and C-B-A are the same when A, B, and C are the block with John, Wilma, and Paul), so we will calculate (40320 * 3!)/6 to account for this and get the correct number for case 1, but since we are looking for the cases where they are not seated together, we can simply subtract 3! times the total arrangements for 7 people (since the 3 of them can be seated in any of the 7 spots in the 8 people arrangement for the 7 people), which would be:\n\n- 8! - (8 * 7!)\n- = 8! - (8 * 7!)\n- = 40320 - (8 * 5040)\n- = 40320 - 40320\n- = 0 \n\nHowever we are not done, we need to add back the (40320 * 3!)/6, we are doubling counting (40320 * 3!)/6. The (40320 * 3)/6 accounts for one of every three of the cases where the three people are seated in consecutive seats in our count in the above expression where we said 0 cases exist (40320 is the count for people seated in blocks of 7, with the 8th being the group of 3), we need (40320 * 3)/6. Now we need to add (40320 * 3)/6 back in.\n\n- (40320 * 3)/6 + 40320\n- (40320 * 3)/6 =  (40320 * 1.5)\n- (40320 * 1.5) =  60880\n- 60880 + 40320\n- 101200\n\nSo, the number of ways for 8 people to be seated in a row, with the restriction that John, Wilma, and Paul cannot sit together, is 101200."
