    "solution": "Let $\\ell$ be the perpendicular bisector of segment $AC$.  We note that the points that are closer to $A$ than they are to $C$ are the points that are on the same side of $\\ell$ as $A$.

Since it passes through the midpoint of $AC$, it also passes through the midpoint of $AB$, which we'll call $D$.\n\nLet $m$ be the perpendicular bisector of segment $BC$.  As before, the points that are closer to $C$ than they are to $B$ are those that lie on the same side of $m$ as $A$, and $m$ also passes through $D$.\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(1);\n\npair C=(0,0), A=(0,3), B=(4,0);\n\npair D = (A+B)/2;\npair E = (C+A)/2;\npair F = (B+C)/2;\n\npair DH = D + (.5,0);\npair EH = E + (-.5,0);\npair DV = D + (0,.5);\npair FV = F + (0,-.5);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(DV--FV,dashed);\nfill(D--F--C--A--cycle,gray(.7));\n\nlabel(\"\\(A\\)\",A,N);\nlabel(\"\\(B\\)\",B,(1,0));\nlabel(\"\\(C\\)\",C,SW);\n\nlabel(\"\\(m\\)\",DV,(0,1));\nlabel(\"\\(D\\)\",D,NE);\n[/asy] Therefore the points that are closer to $C$ than they are to $A$ or $B$ are the points in the shaded rectangle below. [asy]\ndefaultpen(1);\n\npair C=(0,0), A=(0,3), B=(4,0);\n\npair D = (A+B)/2;\npair E = (C+A)/2;\npair F = (B+C)/2;\n\npair DH = D + (.5,0);\npair EH = E + (-.5,0);\npair DV = D + (0,.5);\npair FV = F + (0,-.5);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(DV--FV,dashed);\ndraw(DH--EH,dashed);\nfill(D--F--C--E--cycle,gray(.7));\n\nlabel(\"\\(A\\)\",A,N);\nlabel(\"\\(B\\)\",B,(1,0));\nlabel(\"\\(C\\)\",C,SW);\n\nlabel(\"\\(m\\)\",DV,(0,1));\nlabel(\"\\(\\ell\\)\",DH,(1,0));\nlabel(\"\\(D\\)\",D,NE);\n[/asy] The probability we want is then this rectangle's area divided by triangle $ABC$'s area.  There are a few different ways to see that this ratio is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.  One way is to note that we can divide $ABC$ into 4 congruent triangles, 2 of which are shaded: [asy]\ndefaultpen(1);\n\npair C=(0,0), A=(0,3), B=(4,0);\n\npair D = (A+B)/2;\npair E = (C+A)/2;\npair F = (B+C)/2;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nfill(D--F--C--E--cycle,gray(.7));\n\ndraw(E--D--F);\ndraw(C--D);\n\nlabel(\"\\(A\\)\",A,N);\nlabel(\"\\(B\\)\",B,(1,0));\nlabel(\"\\(C\\)\",C,SW);\n\nlabel(\"\\(D\\)\",D,NE);\n[/asy] Another way is to notice that the rectangle's sides have length $\\frac{3}{2}$ and $\\frac{4}{2}$, so that the rectangle's area is $\\frac{3 \\cdot 4}{2 \\cdot 2}$.  Since triangle $ABC$'s area is $\\frac{3 \\cdot 4}{2}$, it follows that the probability we seek is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$, as before.",

    "model_solution": "The area of the entire triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 = 6$. To find the probability that $P$ is closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$, we need to find the area of the region inside $ABC$ that is closer to $C$ than to $A$ or $B$.\n\nDrawing the perpendicular bisectors of segments $AC$ and $BC$, we see that these bisectors meet at the midpoint of $AB$. Since $ABC$ is a 3-4-5 right triangle, the midpoint of $AB$ is the point $(2,2)$, or $\\frac{4}{5}(2,2)$ in terms of $AB$. The perpendicular bisectors of $AC$ and $BC$ are the lines $y=x$ and $y=-x+4$ respectively, so the region closer to $C$ is the rectangle with corners $(0,0)$, $(2,2)$, $(4,0)$ and $(2,0)$. The area of the rectangle is $4$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that $P$ is closer to $C$ than it is to $A$ or $B$ is $\\frac{4}{6}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$."
