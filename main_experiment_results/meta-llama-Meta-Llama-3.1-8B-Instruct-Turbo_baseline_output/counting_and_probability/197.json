    "problem": "A pirate is searching for buried treasure on 6 islands. On each island, there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that the island has buried treasure and no traps, a $\\frac{1}{12}$ chance that the island has traps but no treasure, and a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance that the island has neither traps nor treasure. What is the probability that while searching all 6 islands, the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure, and none with traps?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose 3 islands. For each of these choices, there is a probability of $\\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3$ that the chosen islands have treasure and the remaining ones have neither treasure nor traps. Therefore, the probability that the pirate encounters exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps is $20 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps while searching all 6 islands, we need to find the probability of 3 islands having treasure and the remaining 3 having neither traps nor treasure.\n\nThe probability of an island having treasure and no traps is $\\frac{1}{4}$, and the probability of an island having neither traps nor treasure is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 islands out of 6 to have treasure is $\\binom{6}{3}=20$.\n\nThe probability of 3 islands having treasure and the remaining 3 having neither traps nor treasure is $(\\frac{1}{4})^3(\\frac{2}{3})^3$.\n\nTherefore, the total probability of the pirate encountering exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps is $\\binom{6}{3}(\\frac{1}{4})^3(\\frac{2}{3})^3=\\frac{160}{729}$.\n\nSo, the probability that the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps while searching all 6 islands is $\\frac{160}{729}$."
