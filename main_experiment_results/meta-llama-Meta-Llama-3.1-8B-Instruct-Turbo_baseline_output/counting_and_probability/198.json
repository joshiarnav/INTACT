    "problem": "An unfair coin lands on heads with probability $\\frac34$ and tails with probability $\\frac14$.  A heads flip gains $\\$3$, but a tails flip loses $\\$8$.  What is the expected worth of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "By definition, we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities, and add them up: $E = \\frac34(+\\$3) + \\frac14(-\\$8) = \\boxed{\\$0.25}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the expected worth of the coin flip, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by its worth and add the results. \n\nThe probability of heads is $\\frac34$ and the worth of heads is $\\$3$, so the contribution of heads to the expected worth is $\\frac34 \\times \\$3 = \\$2.25$. \n\nThe probability of tails is $\\frac14$ and the worth of tails is $-\\$8$, so the contribution of tails to the expected worth is $\\frac14 \\times -\\$8 = -\\$2.00$.\n\nThe total expected worth is the sum of these contributions: $\\$2.25 - \\$2.00 = \\$0.25$. Therefore, the expected worth of the coin flip is $\\$0.25$."
