    "problem": "The probability that Kim has a math test today is $\\frac{4}{7}$. What is the probability that Kim does not have a math test today? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that Kim does not have a math test is equal to one minus the probability she does have a math test. So, the probability of not having a math test is $1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$.",
