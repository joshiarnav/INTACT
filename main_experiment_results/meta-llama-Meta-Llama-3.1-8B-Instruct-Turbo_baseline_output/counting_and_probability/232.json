    "solution": "We note that the points for which $x+y<3$ are those that lie below the line $x+y = 3$, or $y= -x + 3$.  As the diagram below illustrates, these are all the points in the square except those in the triangle with vertices (2,1), (2,2), and (1,2).\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(.7);\n\ndraw((-.1,0)--(3,0),Arrow);\ndraw((0,-.1)--(0,4),Arrow);\n\ndraw((0,2)--(2,2)--(2,0));\ndraw((-.5,3.5)--(2.5,.5),dashed,Arrows);\n\nfill((0,0)--(0,2)--(1,2)--(2,1)--(2,0)--cycle,gray(.7));\n\nlabel(\"(1,2)\",(1,2),NE);\nlabel(\"(2,2)\",(2,2),NE);\nlabel(\"(2,1)\",(2,1),NE);\n[/asy]\n\nSince this is a right triangle whose sides both of length 1, its area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1^2 = 1/2$.  Since the square in question has side length 2, its area is $2^2 = 4$, so the shaded region has area $4 - 1/2 = 7/2$.  Our probability is therefore $\\dfrac{7/2}{4} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{8}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that $x+y < 3$, we first need to understand the geometric region defined by the inequality $x+y < 3$. \n\nThe inequality $x+y < 3$ can be rewritten as $y < -x + 3$. This is the equation of a line passing through the points (3, 0) and (0, 3). Therefore, the region defined by the inequality $x+y < 3$ is the area below the line $y = -x + 3$.\n\nNow, we need to find the area of the region below the line $y = -x + 3$ within the square with vertices (0,0), (0,2), (2,2), and (2,0). \n\nThe line $y = -x + 3$ intersects the square at the points (1, 2) and (1, 0). \n\nThe region below the line $y = -x + 3$ within the square is a triangle with vertices (1, 0), (1, 2), and (0, 2).\n\nThe area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}bh = \\frac{1}{2}(2)(2) = 2$. \n\nThe area of the square is $2^2 = 4$. \n\nThe probability that $x+y < 3$ is the ratio of the area of the region below the line $y = -x + 3$ to the area of the square. \n\nTherefore, the probability is $\\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$."
