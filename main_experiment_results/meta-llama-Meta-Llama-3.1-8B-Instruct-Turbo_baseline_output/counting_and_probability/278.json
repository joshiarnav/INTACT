    "problem": "After a gymnastics meet, each gymnast shook hands once with every gymnast on every team (except herself). Afterwards, a coach came down and only shook hands with each gymnast from her own team. There were a total of 281 handshakes. What is the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in?",
    "solution": "The number of gymnasts is some integer $n$, so that the number of gymnast-gymnast handshakes is ${n \\choose 2}$ for some $n$. Also, the coach must participate in an integer $k<n$ number of handshakes. So, ${n \\choose 2} + k = 281$. If we want to minimize $k$, we need the maximal $n$ such that ${n \\choose 2} \\le 281$, which implies $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 281$ or $n^2 - n - 562 \\le 0 $. So, the maximal $n$ is 24. So, $k = 281 - {24 \\choose 2} = 281 - 12 \\cdot 23 = 281 - 276 = \\boxed{5}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the minimum number of handshakes the coach participated in, we need to analyze the handshakes among gymnasts first. \n\nLet's denote the total number of gymnasts as 'n'. The total number of handshakes between gymnasts is the sum of the handshakes among gymnasts on the same team and handshakes among gymnasts from different teams. However, since each gymnast shook hands with every gymnast on every team except herself, we can express the total number of handshakes among gymnasts as a combination of 'n' taken 2 at a time minus each team's internal handshakes: \n\nComb(n, 2) - (team1 internal handshakes + team2 internal handshakes + ...)\n\nThis can also be written as: \n\n(n * (n - 1)) / 2 - (team1 internal handshakes + team2 internal handshakes + ...)\n\nWhere teami internal handshakes = i, since a team of i gymnasts will have i(i - 1)/2 handshakes, but that is not correct, so the actual expression is:\n\n(n * (n - 1)) / 2 - (team1 internal handshakes + team2 internal handshakes + ...)\n\nThe key is that for each team, the handshakes that are not internal are the handshakes with gymnasts from other teams. The total number of gymnasts in other teams is n - i (where i is the number of gymnasts in the current team). \n\nLet's denote the number of teams as 't'. Then we have: \n\n(n * (n - 1)) / 2 - (1 + 2 + ... + t) \n\nThis can also be written as: \n\n(n * (n - 1)) / 2 - (t * (t + 1)) / 2 \n\nWe are given that the total number of handshakes is 281. Therefore, we can write: \n\n(n^2 - n) / 2 - (t * (t + 1)) / 2 = 281 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get: \n\nn^2 - n - t^2 - t = 562\n\nNow we need to find the smallest 'n' that satisfies this equation for some 't'. By plugging in values of 'n' and checking divisibility of n^2 - n - 562 by t^2 + t, we can find the smallest 'n'."
