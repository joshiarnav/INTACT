    "problem": "William is taking the 25-question, multiple choice American Mathematics Competition. Each question has five answer choices. William guesses random answers for the last four questions. What is the probability that he will get at least one of these final four questions right?",
    "solution": "We find the probability that William misses the last four questions, and subtract from 1. The probability of William missing a question is $\\frac{4}{5}$, so the probability that he misses all four is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = \\frac{256}{625}$. The probability that he gets at least one right is $1-\\frac{256}{625} =\\boxed{\\frac{369}{625}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Since each question has 5 answer choices, the probability of getting any one question right by guessing is 1/5. \n\nThe probability of getting all 4 questions wrong by guessing is (4/5) * (4/5) * (4/5) * (4/5) = (4/5)^4.\n\nTo find the probability of getting at least one question right, we subtract the probability of getting all 4 questions wrong from 1.\n\nProbability of getting at least one question right = 1 - (4/5)^4\n= 1 - 256/625\n= (625 - 256) / 625\n= 369 / 625\n\nSo, the probability that William will get at least one of the final four questions right is 369/625."
