    "problem": "How many positive multiples of $7$ that are less than $1000$ end with the digit $3$?",
    "solution": "Listing the first 10 multiples of 7, which are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, we see that the only positive multiples of 7 that end in 3 are those that are the product of 7 and a number that ends in 9.  Therefore, the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3 are $7\\cdot 9 = 63$, $7\\cdot 19= 133$, $7\\cdot 29 = 203$, . . .  Notice that we can get from each to the next by adding $7\\cdot 10 = 70$, so our multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 are 63, 133, 203, . . ., 903, 973.  The last one is 910 more than the first. Since $910/70=13$, we see that we have taken 13 steps of 70 to get from the first number in the list to the last. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{14}$ numbers in the list.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of positive multiples of $7$ that are less than $1000$ and end with the digit $3$, we need to find all the numbers in the form $7n$ where $n$ is a positive integer, and the last digit is $3$. \n\nSince the last digit is $3$ for these numbers, we can represent these as $7n = 10a + 3$, where $a$ is an integer. \n\nWe can rewrite the equation as $7n - 3 = 10a$, or $7n - 10a = 3$. \n\nThe general formula for this is $a = \\frac{7n - 3}{10}$. We need to find all the values of $n$ such that this expression is a positive integer.\n\nFor $n = 1$, we get $a = \\frac{7(1) - 3}{10} = \\frac{4}{10} = 0.4$, which is not a positive integer.\n\nFor $n = 2$, we get $a = \\frac{7(2) - 3}{10} = \\frac{11}{10} = 1.1$, which is not a positive integer.\n\nFor $n = 3$, we get $a = \\frac{7(3) - 3}{10} = \\frac{18}{10} = 1.8$, which is not a positive integer.\n\nFor $n = 4$, we get $a = \\frac{7(4) - 3}{10} = \\frac{25}{10} = 2.5$, which is not a positive integer.\n\nFor $n = 5$, we get $a = \\frac{7(5) - 3}{10} = \\frac{32}{10} = 3.2$, which is not a positive integer.\n\nFor $n = 6$, we get $a = \\frac{7(6) - 3}{10} = \\frac{39}{10} = 3.9$, which is not a positive integer.\n\nFor $n = 7$, we get $a = \\frac{7(7) - 3}{10} = \\frac{46}{10} = 4.6$, which is not a positive integer.\n\nFor $n = 8$, we get $a = \\frac{7(8) - 3}{10} = \\frac{53}{10} = 5.3$, which is not a positive integer.\n\nFor $n = 9$, we get $a = \\frac{7(9) - 3}{10} = \\frac{60}{10} = 6$, which is a positive integer.\n\nWe can see that for every ten values of $n$, the expression $a = \\frac{7n - 3}{10}$ is a positive integer exactly once. \n\nNow we need to find the number of positive multiples of $7$ that are less than $1000$. Since $7 \\cdot 142 < 1000 < 7 \\cdot 143$, there are $143 - 142 = 1$ hundred and forty-three negative, non-zero multiples of $7$ less than $1000$ before $n=143$ and, since $n$ must be positive, we must consider 142 multiples less than 1000. Thus we know that the 143rd multiple of $7$ is greater than 1000.\n\nSince $n = 9$ works, we can continue trying values of $n$ by adding multiples of 10 to $n = 9$, since we know that for every ten values of $n$, the expression $a = \\frac{7n - 3}{10}$ is a positive integer exactly once. \n\nThus, we have the values of $n$ as $9, 19, 29, \\ldots, 139$. \n\nThere are $139 - 9 = 130$ values of $n$ where $a$ is a positive integer."
