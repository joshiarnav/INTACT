    "problem": "If two distinct numbers are selected at random from the first seven prime numbers, what is the probability that their sum is an even number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2. There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum IS even is $1-\\frac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",

    "model_solution": "The first seven prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17. \n\nTo find the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers is even, we need to consider the cases where the sum is odd and subtract this from 1.\n\nAn even sum can occur when both numbers are even or both numbers are odd. \n\nThere's only one even prime number in the list (2), so the only way to get an even sum with two distinct numbers is when we pick two odd prime numbers. \n\nThe number of odd prime numbers in the list is 6 (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17), and we need to choose 2 distinct numbers from these 6. This can be done in C(6,2) = 6!/(2!*4!) = 15 ways. \n\nThere are a total of C(7,2) = 7!/(2!*5!) = 21 ways to choose 2 distinct numbers from the 7 prime numbers.\n\nThe probability that the sum of two distinct numbers is even is the number of ways to get an even sum divided by the total number of ways to choose two distinct numbers, which is 15/21 = 5/7.\n\nSo the probability that their sum is an even number is 5/7."
