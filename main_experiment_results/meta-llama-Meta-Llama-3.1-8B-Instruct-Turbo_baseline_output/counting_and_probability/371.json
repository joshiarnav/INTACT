    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable but the boxes are?",
    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of balls in the different boxes.\n\nThere are $3$ ways to arrange the balls as $(5,0,0)$ (specifically, box 1 can have 5, box 2 can have 5, box 3 can have 5).\n\nThere are $3! = 6$ to arrange $(4,1,0)$ and $3! = 6$ ways to arrange $(3,2,0)$; in each case, we must choose one of the 3 boxes to have the largest number of balls, and also one of the remaining two boxes to be left empty.\n\nHowever, there are only $3$ ways to arrange $(3,1,1)$, and $3$ ways to arrange $(2,2,1)$; in each case, we must choose one box to have the `different' number of balls (3 in the $(3,1,1)$ case and 1 in the $(2,2,1)$ case).\n\nThis gives a total of $3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = \\boxed{21}$ arrangements.",

    "model_solution": "This problem can be solved using \"stars and bars\" method. \n\nWe have 5 indistinguishable balls and 3 distinguishable boxes. This can be visualized as 5 stars (representing the balls) and 2 bars (representing the separation between the boxes). \n\nThe number of ways to arrange these 7 objects (5 stars and 2 bars) is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\n7! / (5! * 2!)\n\n= 7! / (5! * 2!)\n= (7 * 6) / (2 * 1)\n= 21\n\nHowever, this is overcounting because we have counted each arrangement more than once. The correct formula for the case is:\n\n(n + k - 1)! / ((n - 1)! * k!)\n\nwhere n is the number of balls (5) and k is the number of boxes (3).\n\nSo the correct way to find the solution is:\n(5 + 3 - 1)! / ((5 - 1)! * 3!)\n= 7! / (4! * 3!)\n= (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n= 35\n\nThere are 35 ways to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable but the boxes are."
