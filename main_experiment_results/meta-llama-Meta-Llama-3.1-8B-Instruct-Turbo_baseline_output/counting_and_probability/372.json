    "solution": "The number of pairs of neighbors for Cara actually has nothing to do with the shape of the table she is sitting at. That is, all that matters is that she has 5 friends and two of them will be her neighbors. There are ${5 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{10}$ pairs of friends that she can thus sit between.",

    "model_solution": "There are 5 friends sitting around the circular table, and we want to find the number of different pairs that Cara can sit between. \n\nSince it's a circular table, the arrangement doesn't matter (i.e., sitting to the left of one person is the same as sitting to the right of the other). Therefore, we need to consider pairs of adjacent people.\n\nIf we consider the order of the friends, there are 5 friends, and thus 5 possible pairs of adjacent friends. \n\nSince \"left\" and \"right\" are the same in this problem, we divide the number of possible pairs by 2 to avoid overcounting.\n\nSo, the number of different possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between is 5/2 = 2.5\n\nHowever, we can't have a fraction of people, so we should round down to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2 pairs, but we still need to check if it is possible to have 2 pairs or if the \"0.5\" is a result of incorrect problem solving.\n\nIn the case of circular table problems, the \"0.5\" issue usually occurs because we counted both clockwise and counter-clockwise \"lefts\" or \"rights\" as the same, thus dividing the count by 2.\n\nIn this case, to avoid the division by 2 issue and get the correct \"number of pairs,\" let's think about it in another way.\n\nIf we are selecting two people, out of the 5 friends, the number of ways to do this is $\\binom{5}{2}$, which is 10.\n\nHowever, since the order \"left\" and \"right\" is the same, we still have to \"remove\" the overcounted pairs.\n\nTo do this, let's focus on Cara's perspective. If Cara looks to her left, there is only 1 person on her left and \"one\" corresponding \"right\" neighbor to the right of Cara. Thus, if Cara is looking to her left, there is only 1 \"left-right\" pair.\n\nThe problem states that Cara is sitting at a table with her 5 friends. So \"left\" and \"right\" are determined by the position of Cara, thus we don't \"overcount\" by counting both \"left\" and \"right\" as the same.\n\nSo, \"left-right\" pairs are uniquely determined by the \"left\" neighbor of Cara.\n\nSo, \"left-right\" is uniquely determined by the \"left\" neighbor of Cara.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 \"left-right\" pairs."
