    "model_solution": "To find the probability that $x+y \\le 4$, we need to find the area of the region where $x+y \\le 4$ and divide it by the total area of the rectangle.\n\nThe total area of the rectangle is $3 \\times 6 = 18$.\n\nNow, let's find the area of the region where $x+y \\le 4$. This is a trapezoid with vertices $(0,0)$, $(0,4)$, $(3,1)$, and $(3,0)$. The area of a trapezoid is given by:\n\nArea = $(\\frac{a+b}{2})h$\n\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the parallel sides, and $h$ is the height. \n\nIn this case, $a = 4$, $b = 1$, and $h = 3$. \n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is:\n\nArea = $(\\frac{4+1}{2}) \\times 3 = \\frac{15}{2} \\times 3 = \\frac{45}{2}$.\n\nHowever, the area above is for the trapezoid above the line. But we also need to consider the triangle below the line $x+y = 4$, above the line $y = 0$ and to the right of $x = 0$.\n\nBase = 3, \nHeight = 3 (Because y = 3 + x -4 and the max of that is zero or negative, so it is a triangle that is a right triangle with a base of 3, and a height of 3. Thus area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 3$ = $\\frac{9}{2}$.\n\nNow the area of the trapezoid plus the area of the triangle equals the area of the trapezoid with the triangle subtracted from it. Thus Area of trapezoid + area of triangle = $\\frac{45}{2}$ + $\\frac{9}{2}$ = $\\frac{54}{2}$ = $27$.\n\nHowever, the correct method to solve for the area of this trapezoid would be to subtract this triangle from the area of the entire area of the rectangle and then dividing that area by the total area of the rectangle.\n\nThe area of the trapezoid without the triangle is $27$ as before, and the area of the rectangle is $18$. The probability of the area where $x + y \\le 4$ is then $\\frac{27}{18}$.\n\n$\\frac{27}{18}$ can be simplified to $\\frac{3}{2}$."
