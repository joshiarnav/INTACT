    "problem": "There are 12 different-colored crayons in a box. How many ways can Karl select four crayons if the order in which he draws them out does not matter?",
    "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "This is a combination problem, where the order doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items, and r is the numberItemSelectedListener.\n\nIn this case, n = 12 (total number of crayons) and r = 4 (number of crayons Karl selects).\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * (12 - 4)!)\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * 8!)\nC(12, 4) = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\nC(12, 4) = 495\n\nSo, there are 495 ways Karl can select four crayons from the box, where the order in which he selects them does not matter."
