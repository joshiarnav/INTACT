    "problem": "Compute \\[\\frac{(N-1)!(N)}{(N+1)!}.\\]",
    "solution": "Since $N!=(N-1)!(N)$, we can rewrite the given fraction as $\\frac{N!}{(N+1)!}$. We can rewrite the denominator as $(N+1)!=(N!)(N+1)$, so the fraction becomes $\\frac{N!}{(N!)(N+1)}$. Canceling an $N!$ from the numerator and denominator, we are left with $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{N+1}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To simplify the expression \\[\\frac{(N-1)!(N)}{(N+1)!},\\] we need to understand what the factorial notation means.\n\n- The factorial of a number n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.\n- (N-1)! is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to (N-1).\n- (N+1)! is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to (N+1).\n\nWe can simplify the expression by using the definition of factorial. \n\n\\[\\frac{(N-1)!(N)}{(N+1)!} = \\frac{(N-1)!(N)}{(N+1)(N)(N-1)!}.\\]\n\nWe can see that (N-1)! is present in both the numerator and the denominator. This means we can cancel them out, leaving:\n\n\\[\\frac{(N-1)!(N)}{(N+1)(N)(N-1)!} = \\frac{N}{(N+1)(N)}.\\]\n\nWe can further simplify this expression by cancelling out the (N) in the numerator and the denominator, leaving:\n\n\\[\\frac{N}{(N+1)(N)} = \\frac{1}{(N+1)}.\\]\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression is \\[\\frac{1}{(N+1)}.\\]"
