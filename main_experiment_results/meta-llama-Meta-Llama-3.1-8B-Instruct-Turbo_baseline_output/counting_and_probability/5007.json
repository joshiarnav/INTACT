    "problem": "What is the largest $2$-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$?\n",
    "solution": "Expanding the binomial coefficient, we get ${200 \\choose 100}=\\frac{200!}{100!100!}$. Let the required prime be $p$; then $10 \\le p < 100$. If $p > 50$, then the factor of $p$ appears twice in the denominator. Thus, we need $p$ to appear as a factor at least three times in the numerator, so $3p<200$. The largest such prime is $\\boxed{61}$, which is our answer.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest 2-digit prime factor of $n = {200\\choose 100}$, we need to find the prime factorization of $n$. \n\nFirst, let's rewrite $n$ as follows:\n\\[{200\\choose 100} = \\frac{200!}{100!(200-100)!} = \\frac{200!}{100!100!}\\]\n\nThen, we can use the fact that $200!$ can be written as a product of two factorials that can be easily split in to smaller prime factors.\n\\[\\frac{200!}{100!100!} = \\frac{(100!) (101\\cdot 102 \\cdots 200 )}{100!100!}\\]\nSince we want to find the prime factors of the final product, we can ignore the $100!$ in the numerator and denominator. Therefore, we can write\n\\[\\frac{200!}{100!100!} = \\frac{(101\\cdot 102 \\cdots 200 )}{100!}\\]\n\nNow, let's consider the prime factorization of the numbers from $101$ to $200$.\nWe know that all primes larger than $100$ are factors of this product. However, we only need to consider primes in the range of $101$ to $199$. \n\nSince we are looking for the largest two-digit prime factor, we can stop when we encounter the first prime larger than $100$ that is also larger than $\\sqrt{200}$.\n\nThe first prime larger than $100$ and smaller than $\\sqrt{200}$ is 103. \n\nThus, we can ignore all prime factors that are greater than $103$ since they will be grouped in to a prime factor of $103$. \n\nBut, to find this prime factor, we need to know if $103$ is a prime factor of $\\frac{101\\cdot 102 \\cdots 200 }{100!}$. \n\n\\[\\frac{101\\cdot 102 \\cdots 200 }{100!} =\\frac{101\\cdot 102 \\cdots 200 }{(1\\cdot2\\cdots100)}\\]\n\nSince $103$ is larger than $100$, it can't be a prime factor of $100!$. Therefore, we know that $103$ is a prime factor of the final product.\n\nThe largest 2-digit prime factor of $n$ is $\\boxed{97}$"
