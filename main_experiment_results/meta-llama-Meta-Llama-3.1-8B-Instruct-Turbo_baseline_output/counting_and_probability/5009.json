    "problem": "Let $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ be the vertices of a regular tetrahedron each of whose edges measures 1 meter. A bug, starting from vertex $A$, observes the following rule: at each vertex it chooses one of the three edges meeting at that vertex, each edge being equally likely to be chosen, and crawls along that edge to the vertex at its opposite end. Let $p = \\frac n{729}$ be the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ when it has crawled exactly 7 meters. Find the value of $n$.\n",
    "solution": "Let $P(n)$ denote the probability that the bug is at $A$ after it has crawled $n$ meters. Since the bug can only be at vertex $A$ if it just left a vertex which is not $A$, we have $P(n + 1) = \\frac13 (1 - P(n))$. We also know $P(0) = 1$, so we can quickly compute $P(1)=0$, $P(2) = \\frac 13$, $P(3) = \\frac29$, $P(4) = \\frac7{27}$, $P(5) = \\frac{20}{81}$, $P(6) = \\frac{61}{243}$ and $P(7) = \\frac{182}{729}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{182}$. One can solve this recursion fairly easily to determine a closed-form expression for $P(n)$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will use a recursive approach. Let's define $P(n)$ as the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ after it has crawled $n$ meters. We can see that:\n\n- $P(0) = 1$ since the bug starts at vertex $A$.\n- $P(1) = 0$ since the bug cannot be at vertex $A$ after crawling 1 meter.\n- $P(2) = 0$ since the bug cannot be at vertex $A$ after crawling 2 meters.\n- $P(3) = \\frac{1}{3}$ since the bug can be at vertex $A$ after crawling 3 meters if it went from $A$ to $B$, $C$, or $D$ and then back to $A$.\n- $P(4) = \\frac{1}{3}P(3) + \\frac{2}{3}(0) = \\frac{1}{9}$ since the bug can be at vertex $A$ after crawling 4 meters if it went from $A$ to $B$, $C$, or $D$, and then to one of the other two vertices and back to $A$.\n- $P(5) = \\frac{1}{3}P(4) + \\frac{2}{3}(0) = \\frac{1}{27}$ since the bug can be at vertex $A$ after crawling 5 meters if it went from $A$ to $B$, $C$, or $D$, and then to one of the other two vertices, and then back to $A$.\n- $P(6) = \\frac{1}{3}P(5) + \\frac{2}{3}(0) = \\frac{1}{81}$ since the bug can be at vertex $A$ after crawling 6 meters if it went from $A$ to $B$, $C$, or $D$, and then to one of the other two vertices, and then to one of the other two vertices and back to $A$.\n- $P(7) = \\frac{1}{3}P(6) + \\frac{2}{3}(0) + \\frac{1}{3}P(3) + \\frac{2}{3}(0) = \\frac{1}{81} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{10}{729}$\n\nTherefore, the value of $n$ is:\n\n$\\boxed{10}$"
