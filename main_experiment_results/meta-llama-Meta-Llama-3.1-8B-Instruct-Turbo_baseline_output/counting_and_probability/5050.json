    "solution": "Let the two disjoint subsets be $A$ and $B$, and let $C = S-(A+B)$. For each $i \\in S$, either $i \\in A$, $i \\in B$, or $i \\in C$. So there are $3^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ into disjoint $A$, $B$, and $C$.\nHowever, there are $2^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ such that $A = \\emptyset$ and $S = B+C$, and there are $2^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ such that $B = \\emptyset$ and $S = A+C$. But, the combination such that $A = B = \\emptyset$ and $S = C$ is counted twice.\nThus, there are $3^{10}-2\\cdot2^{10}+1$ ordered pairs of sets $(A,B)$. But since the question asks for the number of unordered sets $\\{ A,B \\}$, $n = \\frac{1}{2}(3^{10}-2\\cdot2^{10}+1) = 28501 \\equiv \\boxed{501} \\pmod{1000}$.",

    "model_solution": "We can think of a set of two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ of $\\mathcal{S}$ as a set of elements in $S \\setminus (A \\cup B)$. For each $i \\in \\mathcal{S}$, we can choose whether $i$ will be in $A$, in $B$, or not in either. However, we must exclude the case where both $A$ and $B$ are empty.\n\nSince there are $10$ elements in $\\mathcal{S}$, there are $3^{10}$ ways to assign elements to $A$, $B$, or neither. However, we must subtract the $2$ cases where both $A$ and $B$ are empty.\n\nIt follows that there are $3^{10} - 2$ possible sets of two disjoint subsets. However, this includes cases where one of the subsets is empty. To count the number of cases where neither subset is empty, we need to exclude the cases where either $A$ or $B$ is empty.\n\nTo count the number of cases where one of the subsets is empty, we can count the number of cases where $A$ is empty and $B$ is non-empty, and the number cases where $A$ is non-empty and $B$ is empty, and then add these two numbers together. This is equivalent to counting the number of non-empty subsets of $\\mathcal{S}$, and then multiplying this by $2$.\n\nThe number of non-empty subsets of $\\mathcal{S}$ is $2^{10} - 1$. This is because for each element in $\\mathcal{S}$, we have two choices: we can either include it in the subset or not. However, we must exclude the case where the subset is empty.\n\nSince there are $2^{10} - 1$ non-empty subsets of $\\mathcal{S}$, and we need to count the number of cases where either $A$ or $B$ is empty, we can multiply this by $2$ to get $2(2^{10} - 1)$.\n\nWe can then subtract this from the total number of possible sets of two disjoint subsets to get the number of cases where neither subset is empty:\n\n$$n = 3^{10} - 2 - 2(2^{10} - 1).$$\n\nTo find the remainder obtained when $n$ is divided by $1000$, we can use the fact that $3^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{125}$ and $2^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{125}$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nn &\\equiv 1 - 2 - 2(1) \\pmod{125} \\\\\nn &\\equiv -3 \\pmod{125} \\\\\nn &\\equiv 122 \\pmod{125} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow we need to find the remainder obtained when $n$ is divided by $8$. We can do this by noticing that $3^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nn &\\equiv 1 - 2 - 2(1) \\pmod{8} \\\\\nn &\\equiv -3 \\pmod{8} \\\\\nn &\\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can now use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the remainder obtained when $n$ is divided by $1000$. This involves solving a system of congruences:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nn &\\equiv 122 \\pmod{125} \\\\\nn &\\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can solve this system of congruences by finding a number that is congruent to $122$ modulo $125$ and also congruent to $5$ modulo $8$. We can do this by finding the smallest positive integer that satisfies both congruences.\n\nAfter checking several numbers, we can find that $n \\equiv 387 \\pmod{1000}$ and $n \\equiv 387 \\pmod{125}$ holds true so $n \\equiv 387 \\pmod{1000}$."
