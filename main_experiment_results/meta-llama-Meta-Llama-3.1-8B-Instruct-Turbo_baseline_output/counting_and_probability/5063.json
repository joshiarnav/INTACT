    "problem": "The cards in a stack of $2n$ cards are numbered consecutively from 1 through $2n$ from top to bottom. The top $n$ cards are removed, kept in order, and form pile $A.$ The remaining cards form pile $B.$ The cards are then restacked by taking cards alternately from the tops of pile $B$ and $A,$ respectively. In this process, card number $(n+1)$ becomes the bottom card of the new stack, card number 1 is on top of this card, and so on, until piles $A$ and $B$ are exhausted. If, after the restacking process, at least one card from each pile occupies the same position that it occupied in the original stack, the stack is named magical. For example, eight cards form a magical stack because cards number 3 and number 6 retain their original positions. Find the number of cards in the magical stack in which card number 131 retains its original position.\n",
    "solution": "Since a card from B is placed on the bottom of the new stack, notice that cards from pile B will be marked as an even number in the new pile, while cards from pile A will be marked as odd in the new pile. Since 131 is odd and retains its original position in the stack, it must be in pile A. Also to retain its original position, exactly $131 - 1 = 130$ numbers must be in front of it. There are $\\frac{130}{2} = 65$ cards from each of piles A, B in front of card 131. This suggests that $n = 131 + 65 = 196$; the total number of cards is $196 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{392}$.",

    "model_solution": "To determine the conditions for a card to retain its original position after restacking, we'll analyze the process. When restacking, the cards are alternately taken from piles A and B. So, the top card of the new stack will be from pile B, then the top card of pile A, then the top card of pile B, and so on.\n\nLet's denote the position of the restacked card as k. The k-th card must be taken from pile A if k is odd, and from pile B if k is even.\n\nIf card number 131 retains its original position, then it must be taken from either pile A or pile B, according to the restacking rule.\n\nCard number 131 is from pile A as it is less than n. So it is taken from pile A. This means that 131 must be an odd position in the restacked pile.\n\nLet's denote the number of cards as 2n. As 131 is taken from pile A, we will take cards alternately from pile A and B. \n\nWe can see that for card number 131 to retain its original position, it must be at an odd position in pile A, which is 131 - (n - 131) = 262. So the number of cards in pile A is 262.\n\nNow, we know 262 cards are in pile A. So, n = 131 + (262 - 1)/2 = 196.\n\nThus, the total number of cards in the magical stack is 2 * 196 = 392."
