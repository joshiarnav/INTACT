    "solution": "As with solution $1$ we would like to note that given any quadrilateral we can change its angles to make a cyclic one.\nLet $a \\ge b \\ge c\\ge d$ be the sides of the quadrilateral.\nThere are $\\binom{31}{3}$ ways to partition $32$. However, some of these will not be quadrilaterals since they would have one side bigger than the sum of the other three. This occurs when $a \\ge 16$. For $a=16$, $b+c+d=16$. There are $\\binom{15}{2}$ ways to partition $16$. Since $a$ could be any of the four sides, we have counted $4\\binom{15}{2}$ degenerate quadrilaterals. Similarly, there are $4\\binom{14}{2}$, $4\\binom{13}{2} \\cdots 4\\binom{2}{2}$ for other values of $a$. Thus, there are $\\binom{31}{3} - 4\\left(\\binom{15}{2}+\\binom{14}{2}+\\cdots+\\binom{2}{2}\\right) = \\binom{31}{3} - 4\\binom{16}{3} = 2255$ non-degenerate partitions of $32$ by the hockey stick theorem. We then account for symmetry. If all sides are congruent (meaning the quadrilateral is a square), the quadrilateral will be counted once. If the quadrilateral is a rectangle (and not a square), it will be counted twice. In all other cases, it will be counted 4 times. Since there is $1$ square case, and $7$ rectangle cases, there are $2255-1-2\\cdot7=2240$ quadrilaterals counted 4 times. Thus there are $1+7+\\frac{2240}{4} = \\boxed{568}$ total quadrilaterals.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of different convex cyclic quadrilaterals, we can start by considering a triangle with sides a and b, and an angle C between them. Then we can find the length of c, which is the third side. Using the law of cosines, we have:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab*cos(C)\n\nSince the perimeter is 32, the sum of the three sides a, b, and c is 32. Therefore, we can rewrite c as (32 - a - b).\n\nNow, we substitute (32 - a - b) for c in the equation above:\n\n((32 - a - b)^2) = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab*cos(C)\n\nExpanding and rearranging the equation, we get:\n\na^2 + b^2 + 2ab*cos(C) + a^2 - 2ab*cos(C) + b^2 + 2ab*cos(C) - 2a(32 - a - b) - 2b(32 - a - b) + 2ab*cos(C) - 1024 = 0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab*cos(C) - 64a - 64b + 1024 - 2ab*cos(C) = 0\n\nWe can see that 2ab*cos(C) cancels out. This is because we are considering all possible angles, so we can't know what the value of cos(C) is.\n\nThe equation now becomes:\n\n2a^2 + 2b^2 - 64a - 64b + 1024 = 0\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing everything by 2:\n\na^2 + b^2 - 32a - 32b + 512 = 0\n\nNow, we can rearrange the terms to get:\n\na^2 - 32a + b^2 - 32b = -512\n\nNow, we can complete the square for both the a and b terms:\n\n(a^2 - 32a + 256) + (b^2 - 32b + 256) = -512 + 512\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(a - 16)^2 + (b - 16)^2 = 0\n\nSince we can't have a negative number squared equal zero, both (a - 16)^2 and (b - 16)^2 must equal 0.\n\nTherefore, a - 16 = 0, and b - 16 = 0.\n\nSolving for a and b, we get:\n\na = 16\n\nb = 16\n\nNow, since the perimeter is 32, we know that a + b + c = 32. We can substitute 16 for a and 16 for b to get:\n\n16 + 16 + c = 32\n\nc = 0\n\nHowever, the problem states that the quadrilateral must have integer sides. Therefore, c must be greater than 0.\n\nNow, we consider the fact that the quadrilateral is cyclic. This means that the sum of the lengths of the opposite sides must be greater than the sum of the other two sides.\n\nThe sum of the lengths of the opposite sides is a + c = 16 + c. The sum of the other two sides is b = 16.\n\nSince a + c must be greater than b, we have:\n\n16 + c > 16\n\nc > 0\n\nThis is consistent with our previous result.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the fact that the quadrilateral is convex. This means that the sum of the lengths of the two longer sides must be greater than the sum of the lengths of the two shorter sides.\n\nThe two longer sides are a and c, and their sum is 16 + c. The two shorter sides are b and the smallest possible side, which must be 1 (since it can't be 0).\n\nTheir sum is 16 + 1 = 17.\n\nSince 16 + c must be greater than 17, we have:\n\n16 + c > 17\n\nc > 1\n\nThis is consistent with our previous result.\n\nSince c must be greater than 0 and greater than 1, we know that c must be greater than 1.\n\nNow, we consider the fact that the sides must be integers. Therefore, we can let c = x, where x is an integer greater than 1.\n\nWe can let a = 16 - y, where y is an integer greater than 0.\n\nThe perimeter is 32, so we can write:\n\n(16 - y) + 16 + x = 32\n\nSubtracting 16 from both sides, we get:\n\n16 - y + x = 16\n\nSubtracting 16 from both sides again, we get:\n\n-y + x = 0\n\nAdding y to both sides, we get:\n\nx = y\n\nSince x and y are both integers, and x is greater than y, we can let x = y + 1.\n\nNow, we can substitute x = y + 1 into the equation 16 - y + x = 16.\n\nSubstituting x = y + 1, we get:\n\n16 - y + y + 1 = 16\n\nSubtracting y from both sides, we get:\n\n16 + 1 = 16\n\nThis is a true statement, so we know that our substitution was correct.\n\nNow, we can substitute x = y + 1 into the equation x = y.\n\nSubstituting x = y + 1, we get:\n\ny + 1 = y\n\nSubtracting y from both sides, we get:\n\n1 = 0\n\nThis is a false statement, so we know that x cannot equal y.\n\nHowever, we also know that x must equal y from the equation x = y.\n\nThis is a contradiction, so we must have made an error in our previous steps.\n\nThe error occurred when we said that x and y must be equal. This was not a requirement of the problem.\n\nTherefore, we can let x = y + k, where k is an integer greater than or equal to 1.\n\nNow, we can substitute x = y + k into the equation 16 - y + x = 16.\n\nSubstituting x = y + k, we get:\n\n16 - y + y + k = 16\n\nSubtracting y from both sides, we get:\n\n16 + k = 16\n\nSubtracting 16 from both sides, we get:\n\nk = 0\n\nHowever, we know that k is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, k must equal 1.\n\nNow, we can substitute x = y + k into the equation 16 - y + x = 16.\n\nSubstituting x = y + k, we get:\n\n16 - y + y + k = 16\n\nSubtracting y from both sides, we get:\n\n16 + k = 16\n\nSubtracting 16 from both sides, we get:\n\nk = 0\n\nHowever, we know that k is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, k must equal 1.\n\nSubstituting k = 1 into the equation x = y + k, we get:\n\nx = y + 1\n\nNow, we can substitute x = y + 1 into the equation 16 - y + x = 16.\n\nSubstituting x = y + 1, we get:\n\n16 - y + y + 1 = 16\n\nSubtracting y from both sides, we get:\n\n16 + 1 = 16\n\nThis is a true statement, so we know that our substitution was correct.\n\nNow, we can substitute x = y + 1 into the equation a = 16 - y.\n\nSubstituting x = y + 1, we get:\n\na = 16 - (y + 1)\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides, we get:\n\na = 15 - y\n\nNow, we can substitute a = 15 - y into the equation for the perimeter:\n\n(15 - y) + 16 + (y + 1) = 32\n\nSubtracting 16 from both sides, we get:\n\n15 - y + y + 1 = 16\n\nSubtracting y from both sides, we get:\n\n15 + 1 = 16\n\nThis is a true statement, so we know that our substitution was correct.\n\nNow, we can see that a = 15 - y, b = 16, and c = y + 1.\n\nThe two longer sides are a and c, and their sum is 15 - y + y + 1 = 16.\n\nThe two shorter sides are b and the smallest possible side, which must be 1 (since it can't be 0).\n\nTheir sum is 16 + 1 = 17.\n\nSince 15 - y + y + 1 must be greater than 17, we know that this is true.\n\nTherefore, we have found all the possible values of a, b, and c.\n\nSince a can be any integer from 1 to 15, and b is 16, and c is any integer from 2 to 15, we can find the number of different convex cyclic quadrilaterals with integer sides and perimeter 32.\n\nThe number of possible values of a is 15.\n\nThe number of possible values of c is 14.\n\nThe number of possible values of b is 1.\n\nSince the values of a, b, and c are independent of each other, we can multiply the number of possible values of a, b, and c to get the total number of different convex cyclic quadrilaterals with integer sides and perimeter 32:\n\n15 * 14 * 1 = 210\n\nHowever, this does not take into account the fact that the"
