    "problem": "A mother purchases 5 blue plates, 2 red plates, 2 green plates, and 1 orange plate. How many ways are there for her to arrange these plates for dinner around her circular table if she doesn't want the 2 green plates to be adjacent?\n",
    "solution": "We apply the complement principle: we find the total number of cases in which the 2 green places are adjacent, and subtract from the total number of cases.\nThere are $\\frac{10!}{5!2!2!1!} = 7560$ ways to arrange the plates in a linear fashion. However, since the plates are arranged in a circle, there are $10$ ways to rotate the plates, and so there are $7560/10 = 756$ ways to arrange the plates in a circular fashion (consider, for example, fixing the orange plate at the top of the table).\nIf the two green plates are adjacent, we may think of them as a single entity, so that there are now $9$ objects to be placed around the table in a circular fashion. Using the same argument, there are $\\frac{9!}{5!2!1!1!} = 1512$ ways to arrange the objects in a linear fashion, and $1512/9 = 168$ ways in a circular fashion.\nThus, the answer is $756 - 168 = \\boxed{588}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of circular permutations. The total number of plates is 10.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to arrange all 10 plates in a linear fashion. The formula for permutations of a multiset is:\n\nn! / (n1! * n2! * n3! * ... * nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of objects, and ni is the number of indistinguishable objects of type i.\n\nIn this case, we have 10 plates in total, with 5 blue, 2 red, 2 green, and 1 orange. So the total number of linear permutations is:\n\n10! / (5! * 2! * 2! * 1!)\n\n= 3,628,800 / (120 * 2 * 2 * 1)\n= 3,628,800 / 480\n= 7,560\n\nHowever, since we're arranging the plates in a circle, we need to divide by the number of rotations that would bring us back to the same arrangement. In a circular arrangement, there are 10 possible rotations, so we divide the total number of linear permutations by 10.\n\nTotal number of linear permutations = 7,560\nTotal number of circular permutations = 7,560 / 10\n= 756\n\nNow, to find the number of arrangements where the two green plates are adjacent, we can treat the two green plates as a single unit (the \"green pair\"). This reduces the total number of plates to 9 (the 5 blue, 2 red, 1 orange, and 1 green unit).\n\nWe can calculate the total number of linear permutations for this reduced set of plates:\n\n9! / (5! * 2! * 1! * 1!)\n\n= 362,880 / (120 * 2 * 1 * 1)\n= 362,880 / 240\n= 1,512\n\nHowever, we need to multiply this by the number of ways to arrange the two green plates within the green pair. Since there are 2 ways to arrange 2 plates (either plate can be on the left or the right), we multiply the total number of linear permutations by 2:\n\nTotal number of linear permutations with the green pair = 1,512 * 2\n= 3,024\n\nNow, we divide this total number of linear permutations by 9, the number of plates (including the green unit), to get the total number of circular permutations with the green pair:\n\nTotal number of circular permutations with the green pair = 3,024 / 9\n= 336\n\nNow that we have the total number of arrangements without the green pair being adjacent (756) and the total number of arrangements with the green pair being adjacent (336), we can find the number of arrangements where the green pair is not adjacent by subtracting the number of arrangements with the green pair from the total number of arrangements:\n\nTotal number of circular permutations without the green pair = 756 - 336\n= 420\n\nSo, there are 420 ways to arrange the plates in a circular fashion without the two green plates being adjacent."
