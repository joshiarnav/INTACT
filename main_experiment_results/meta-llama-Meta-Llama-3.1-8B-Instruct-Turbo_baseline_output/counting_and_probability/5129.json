    "problem": "A paperboy delivers newspapers to 10 houses along Main Street. Wishing to save effort, he doesn't always deliver to every house, but to avoid being fired he never misses three consecutive houses. Compute the number of ways the paperboy could deliver papers in this manner.\n",
    "solution": "We can find a recursion. Let $D_n$ be the number of legal delivery sequences for $n$ houses. If a sequence ends with a delivery, we simply append one to $D_{n - 1}$. If it ends in $1$ nondelivery, we append a nondelivery and a delivery to $D_{n - 2}$. If it ends in $2$ nondeliveries, we append them and a delivery to $D_{n - 3}$. So\n$D_n = D_{n - 1} + D_{n - 2} + D_{n - 3}$.\nThus, since clearly $D_1 = 2$, $D_2 = 4$, $D_3 = 7$, we have $D_4 = 13$, $D_5 = 24$, $D_6 = 44$, $D_7 = 81$, $D_8 = 149$, $D_9 = 274$, $D_{10} = \\boxed{504}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with dynamic programming. Let's define a sequence where:\n\n- a1 = 2 (deliver to 1 house or 2 houses)\n- a2 = 4 (deliver to 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 1 and 3, or 1, 2 and 3)\n- a3 = 7 (deliver to houses 1, 2, and 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, or 1, 2, 3 and 4)\n\nHowever, for this problem we may find a simplified approach. \n\nLet's define fn as the number of sequences of length n where no three consecutive houses receive papers. Now fn can be computed by considering the following conditions:\n- fn = (fn-1) + (fn-2) + (fn-3) since we can deliver papers to the last house (fn-1), skip two houses and deliver to the last house (fn-2), or deliver to the last house and the two houses before it (fn-3).\n\nHowever, we also need to consider n=10, so we should use the initial conditions a1=2, a2=4, a3=7.\n\nGiven: f0=1, f1=2, f2=4, f3=7\n\nfn = (fn-1) + (fn-2) + (fn-3)\n\nf4 = (f3) + (f2) + (f1)\n= (7) + (4) + (2)\n= 13\n\nf5 = (f4) + (f3) + (f2)\n= (13) + (7) + (4)\n= 24\n\nf6 = (f5) + (f4) + (f3)\n= (24) + (13) + (7)\n= 44\n\nf7 = (f6) + (f5) + (f4)\n= (44) + (24) + (13)\n= 81\n\nf8 = (f7) + (f6) + (f5)\n= (81) + (44) + (24)\n= 149\n\nf9 = (f8) + (f7) + (f6)\n= (149) + (81) + (44)\n= 274\n\nf10 = (f9) + (f8) + (f7)\n= (274) + (149) + (81)\n= 504\n\nTherefore, there are 504 ways the paperboy could deliver papers in this manner."
