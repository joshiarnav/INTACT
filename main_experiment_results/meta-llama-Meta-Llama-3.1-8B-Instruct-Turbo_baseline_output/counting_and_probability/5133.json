    "problem": "How many 10-digit positive integers have all digits either 1 or 2, and have two consecutive 1's?\n",
    "solution": "We take as our universe the set of 10-digit integers whose digits are all either 1 or 2, of which there are $2^{10}$, and we count the complement. The complement is the set of 10-digit positive integers composed of the digits 1 and 2 with no two consecutive 1s. Counting such numbers is a popular combinatorial problem: we approach it via a recursion.\nThere are two \"good\" one-digit numbers (1 and 2) and three good two-digit numbers (12, 21 and 22). Each such $n$-digit number is formed either by gluing \"2\" on to the end of a good $(n - 1)$-digit number or by gluing \"21\" onto the end of a good $(n - 2)$-digit number. This is a bijection between the good $n$-digit numbers and the union of the good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. Thus, the number of good $n$-digit numbers is the sum of the number of good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. The resulting recursion is exactly that of the Fibonacci numbers with initial values $F_1 = 2$ and $F_2 = 3$.\nThus, our final answer is $2^{10} - F_{10} = 1024 - 144 = \\boxed{880}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can use complementary counting. This means we will find the total number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2, and then subtract the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2, but without any two consecutive 1's.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2. Since each digit can be either 1 or 2, there are 2 possibilities for each digit. With 10 digits, the total number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2 is:\n\n2^10 = 1024\n\nNow, let's find the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2, but without any two consecutive 1's. We can use a recursive approach or a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.\n\nLet a_n be the number of n-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2, but without any two consecutive 1's. We can derive the following recurrence relation:\n\na_1 = 2 (since there is only one way to form a 1-digit number and two ways to form a 2-digit number with no consecutive 1's)\n\na_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} (since we can either append a 2 to any (n-1)-digit number, or append a 1 to any (n-2)-digit number)\n\nUsing this recurrence relation, we can calculate a_10:\n\na_2 = a_1 + a_0 = 2 + 1 = 3\na_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 3 + 2 = 5\na_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 5 + 3 = 8\na_5 = a_4 + a_3 = 8 + 5 = 13\na_6 = a_5 + a_4 = 13 + 8 = 21\na_7 = a_6 + a_5 = 21 + 13 = 34\na_8 = a_7 + a_6 = 34 + 21 = 55\na_9 = a_8 + a_7 = 55 + 34 = 89\na_10 = a_9 + a_8 = 89 + 55 = 144\n\nTherefore, the total number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2, but without any two consecutive 1's is 144.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2, and have two consecutive 1's by subtracting the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2, but without any two consecutive 1's from the total number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2:\n\n1024 - 144 = 880\n\nSo, there are 880 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2, and have two consecutive 1's."
