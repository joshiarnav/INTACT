    "problem": "License plates from different states follow different alpha-numeric formats, which dictate which characters of a plate must be letters and which must be numbers. Florida has license plates with an alpha-numeric format like the one pictured. North Dakota, on the other hand, has a different format, also pictured. Assuming all 10 digits are equally likely to appear in the numeric positions, and all 26 letters are equally likely to appear in the alpha positions, how many more license plates can Florida issue than North Dakota?

    "solution": "Florida issues license plates in which the first three and last slots are filled with letters, and the fourth and fifth are filled with digits. Thus, there are $26^4 \\cdot 10^2$ Florida license plates possible. North Dakota, however, issues license plates in which the first three slots are filled with letters and the last three slots are filled with digits. There are thus $26^3 \\cdot 10^3$ possible North Dakota license plates. Multiplying these out and taking the difference yields an answer of $\\boxed{28121600}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of license plates Florida can issue, we first need to understand its format. From the diagram, it seems Florida's format is XXX XX#, where the first three, the middle two, and the last position are letters, and the last two positions are numbers. \n\nSo, the number of license plates Florida can issue is 26^5 * 10^2, as there are 26 possible letters for each of the 7 letter positions and 10 possible numbers for each of the 2 number positions.\n\nFor North Dakota, it seems the format is XXX XXX, with all positions being letters.\n\nSo, the number of license plates North Dakota can issue is 26^6, as there are 26 possible letters for each of the 6 letter positions.\n\nThe difference in the number of license plates that can be issued by Florida and North Dakota is thus 26^5 * 10^2 - 26^6.\n\nUsing the formula for the difference of squares, a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b), we can rewrite this as 26^6(10^2 - 1) / (10^2 - 1^2).\n\nSimplifying this, we get 26^6(100 - 1) / (100 - 1), which equals 26^6 * (99 / 99), which equals 26^6.\n\nHowever, we can't simplify it further using the difference of squares. Instead, we can express it as (26^6) * (10^2 - 1) / (10^2 - 1).\n\n26^6 is equal to (26^2)^3, or 676^3, and 676 * 676 * 676 equals 28,672,576.\n\n10^2 equals 100, and 100 - 1 equals 99.\n\nTherefore, 26^5 * 10^2 - 26^6 equals 26^6 * (100 - 1) / (100 - 1), which equals 26^6 * 99 / 99, which equals 26^6.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer, as we must calculate 26^5 * 10^2 to find the number of license plates Florida can issue.\n\nSo, 26^5 * 10^2 = 26^5 * 100, which equals 26 * 26 * 26 * 26 * 26 * 100, which equals 26^5 * 100 = 10,862,400,000.\n\nNow that we know the number of plates Florida can issue, we can subtract 26^6 to find the difference.\n\n26^6 is equal to 67,108,864.\n\nSo, the difference is 10,862,400,000 - 67,108,864.\n\nThis equals 10,795,291,136.\n\nTherefore, Florida can issue 10,795,291,136 - 67,108,864 more license plates than North Dakota. \n\n10,795,291,136 - 67,108,864 = 10,728,182,272.\n\nThe answer is 10,728,182,272."
