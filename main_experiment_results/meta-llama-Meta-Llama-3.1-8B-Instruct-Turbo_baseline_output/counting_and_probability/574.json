    "problem": "An integer greater than 9 and less than 100 is randomly chosen. What is the probability that its digits are different?",
    "solution": "We calculate the probability that the digits are the same, and subtract from 1. From the 90 integers to be chosen from, only 9 have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, ..., 99. Therefore, the probability that the digits are the same is $\\frac{9}{90} = \\frac{1}{10}$, so the probability that the digits are different is $1-\\frac{1}{10}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability, we first need to find the total number of two-digit numbers and then find the number of two-digit numbers with different digits.\n\n1. Total number of two-digit numbers: \nThere are 9 options (1-9) for the first digit (10 is excluded as the problem states it's greater than 9). \nFor the second digit, there are 10 options (0-9). \nSo, the total number of two-digit numbers is 9 * 10 = 90.\n\nHowever, since the problem states the number is less than 100, only 9 * 10 = 90 numbers are possible, but we should consider numbers in the 10-99 range. Since numbers 10-19 only consist of numbers where the first digit is 1, we should remove one for every number from 10-19 from the pool of numbers where the first digit can be any of 1-9.\n\n2. Number of two-digit numbers with different digits:\nFor the first digit, we have 9 options (1-9). \nFor the second digit, we have 9 options (0 is excluded as it would result in a one-digit number, and we can't use the same digit as the first one). \n\nSo, the number of two-digit numbers with different digits is 9 * 9 = 81.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the numbers from 10-19 where the first digit is 1. For these numbers, only 9 options are available for the second digit (0 is excluded, and we can't use the same digit as the first one).\n\nSo, the actual number of two-digit numbers with different digits is 9 * 9 - 10 * 1 = 9 * 9 - 10 = 79.\n\n3. Probability calculation:\nTo find the probability, we need to divide the number of two-digit numbers with different digits by the total number of two-digit numbers.\n\nProbability = Number of two-digit numbers with different digits / Total number of two-digit numbers\nProbability = 79 / 90\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. \n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.88 or 88/100."
