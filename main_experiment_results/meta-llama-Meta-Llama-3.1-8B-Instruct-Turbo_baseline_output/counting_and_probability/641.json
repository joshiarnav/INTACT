    "problem": "If I have a $4\\times 4$ chess board, in how many ways can I place four distinct pawns on the board such that each column and row of the board contains no more than one pawn?",
    "solution": "Because our chess board is $4 \\times 4$, there must be exactly one pawn in each column and each row. Consider the ways to place one pawn in each row. In the first row, there are four potential spots for a pawn. However, no matter where we place the pawn, it takes up one column. So, in the second row, there are only three potential spots for a pawn. Similarly, there are two spots in the third row and only one in the fourth. Thus, there are $4\\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 24$ ways in which we can place the pawns. Now, because each pawn is distinct, we have four possible pawns to place in the first slot, three in the second, two in the fourth, and one in the last. So there are $24$ possible orderings of the pawns. Our final answer is thus $24^2 = \\boxed{576}$.",

    "model_solution": "To place the four distinct pawns on the board such that each column and row contains no more than one pawn, we need to consider the placement of each pawn one by one.\n\n1. For the first pawn, there are 16 possible positions (4 rows * 4 columns).\n2. For the second pawn, there are 9 possible positions left (since one row and one column are occupied by the first pawn, there are 3 rows * 3 columns left).\n3. For the third pawn, there are 4 possible positions left (since two rows and two columns are occupied by the first two pawns, there are 2 rows * 2 columns left).\n4. For the fourth pawn, there is only 1 position left (since three rows and three columns are occupied by the first three pawns).\n\nTo find the total number of ways to place the four distinct pawns, we multiply the number of possible positions at each step:\n\n16 * 9 * 4 * 1 = 576\n\nHowever, the order of placement of the pawns also matters, since each pawn is distinct. Therefore, we can multiply the result by the factorial of the number of pawns (4!), which accounts for the different ways of ordering the placement of the pawns:\n\n576 * 4! = 576 * 24 = 13,824\n\nHowever, the pawns are distinct, therefore we don't multiply by 4! as we have already taken into account the distinctness when we set up the board given the distinctness of the pawns. The correct answer is:\n\n576."
