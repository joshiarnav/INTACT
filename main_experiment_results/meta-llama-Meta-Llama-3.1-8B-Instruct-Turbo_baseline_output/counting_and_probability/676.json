    "problem": "I have 10 distinguishable socks in my drawer: 4 white, 4 brown, and 2 blue.  In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of the same color?",
    "solution": "The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue.  If the socks are white, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are brown, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are blue, there is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ choice.  So the total number of choices for socks is $6 + 6 + 1 = \\boxed{13}$.",

    "model_solution": "To choose a pair of socks of the same color, we need to consider each color separately.\n\n1. For the white socks, we can choose a pair in 4C2 (4 choose 2) ways, which is equal to 6. \n   The formula for nCk is n! / (k!(n-k)!), where \"!\" denotes the factorial function.\n   So, 4C2 = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 4! / (2! * 2!) = (4 * 3) / (2 * 1) = 6.\n\n2. For the brown socks, we can choose a pair in 4C2 ways, which is also equal to 6.\n\n3. For the blue socks, we can choose a pair in 2C2 ways, which is equal to 1.\n\nNow, we add the number of ways for each color to get the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color:\n6 (white) + 6 (brown) + 1 (blue) = 13.\n\nTherefore, there are 13 ways to choose a pair of socks, provided that you get two socks of the same color."
