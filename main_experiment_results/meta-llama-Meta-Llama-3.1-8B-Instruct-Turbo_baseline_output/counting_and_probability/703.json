    "model_solution": "To choose two colors out of seven, we use the combination formula. The formula for combination is nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items being chosen.\n\nIn this case, n = 7 (seven colors) and r = 2 (two colors being chosen). \n\nSo, 7C2 = 7! / (2!(7-2)!) \n= (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((2*1)*(5*4*3*2*1))\n= (7*6) / (2*1)\n= 21\n\nThere are 21 ways for George to choose two colors out of seven to paint his room."
