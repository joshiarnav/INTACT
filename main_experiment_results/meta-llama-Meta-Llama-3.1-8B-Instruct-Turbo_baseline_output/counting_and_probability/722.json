    "problem": "Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace?",
    "solution": "We have two cases because if the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$, it could be an ace or not be an ace.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{3}{51} = \\dfrac{1}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the three remaining aces, which gives a probability of $\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot \\dfrac{1}{17} = \\dfrac{1}{884}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{12}{52} = \\dfrac{3}{13}$ chance that a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the ace is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{4}{51}$ chance that an ace is drawn second, giving a $\\dfrac{3}{13}\\cdot \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{4}{221}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nSo the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\\dfrac{1}{884} + \\dfrac{4}{221} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}$.\n\nNotice that we can avoid some of the large denominators above by organizing this computation as follows: $$\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{3}{51}+\\dfrac{12}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{1\\cdot 3+12\\cdot 4}{52\\cdot 51} = \\dfrac{51}{52\\cdot 51}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}.$$",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of conditional probability. \n\nThe total number of cards in a standard deck is 52. The number of cards that are $\\diamondsuit$ is 13, and the number of aces is 4. \n\nFirst, we need to find the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$. This probability is given by the number of $\\diamondsuit$ cards divided by the total number of cards: $\\frac{13}{52}$.\n\nNow, to find the probability that the second card is an ace, we have two cases:\n\n- Case 1: The first card is an ace of $\\diamondsuit$. In this case, the number of aces left in the deck is 3, and the total number of cards left in the deck is 51.\n- Case 2: The first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ but not an ace of $\\diamondsuit$. In this case, the number of aces left in the deck is 4, and the total number of cards left in the deck is 51.\n\nHowever, we must consider that the first card being an ace of $\\diamondsuit$ has a probability of $\\frac{1}{52}$, and the first card being a $\\diamondsuit$ but not an ace of $\\diamondsuit$ has a probability of $\\frac{12}{52}$.\n\nSo, to find the overall probability, we will use the law of total probability: \n\nP(first card is $\\diamondsuit$ and second card is an ace) = P(first card is ace of $\\diamondsuit$ and second card is an ace) + P(first card is $\\diamondsuit$ but not an ace of $\\diamondsuit$ and second card is an ace)\n\n= P(first card is ace of $\\diamondsuit$) * P(second card is an ace | first card is ace of $\\diamondsuit$) + P(first card is $\\diamondsuit$ but not an ace of $\\diamondsuit$) * P(second card is an ace | first card is $\\diamondsuit$ but not an ace of $\\diamondsuit$)\n\n= $\\frac{1}{52}$ * $\\frac{3}{51}$ + $\\frac{12}{52}$ * $\\frac{4}{51}$\n\n= $\\frac{1}{52}$ * $\\frac{3}{51}$ + $\\frac{12}{52}$ * $\\frac{4}{51}$\n\n= $\\frac{3}{2652}$ + $\\frac{48}{2652}$\n\n= $\\frac{51}{2652}$\n\n= $\\frac{1}{52}$\n\nThe probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace is $\\frac{1}{52}$."
