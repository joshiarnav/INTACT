    "problem": "Seven people arrive to dinner, but the circular table only seats six.  If two seatings such that one is a rotation of the other are considered the same, then in how many different ways can we choose six people and seat them at the table?",
    "solution": "There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing.  To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person.  This suggests that there are $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people.  However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count.  Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table.  There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of different seatings, we'll first calculate the number of permutations of 6 people out of 7. This can be done using the combination formula, but since we're dealing with permutations (order matters), we'll use the permutation formula:\n\n7P6 = 7! / (7-6)!\n= 7! / 1!\n= 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n= 5040\n\nHowever, since the table is circular and rotations of the same seating are considered the same, we need to divide this by the number of people to account for the rotations. \n\nThere are 6 people, and for each seating, we can rotate it 6 times and still consider it the same. However, one rotation is the same as the original one, so we only actually need to divide by 6 to avoid counting rotations as different seatings.\n\nSo the final answer is 5040 / 6 = 840."
