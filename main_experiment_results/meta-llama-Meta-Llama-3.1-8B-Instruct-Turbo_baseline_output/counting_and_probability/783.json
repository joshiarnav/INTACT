    "solution": "We consider the unordered pairs, or sets, of spins for which the difference of the numbers are greater than or equal to 3, or those games which Jane loses. These can only occur in the sets $\\{1, 4\\}$, $\\{1, 5 \\}$ or $\\{ 2, 5 \\}$. Each of these unordered pairs can occur in 2 orderings (depending on whether Jane or her brother spins each number). So, there are $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ losing combinations out of $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ for Jane. So, her winning probability is $1 - \\frac{6}{25} = \\boxed{\\frac{19}{25}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that Jane wins, we need to count the number of outcomes where the non-negative difference of their numbers is less than 3. \n\nThe spinner has five congruent sectors. Since Jane and her brother each spin the spinner once, we can consider the possible outcomes as pairs of numbers from 1 to 5 where each number represents the outcome of Jane's or her brother's spin.\n\nWe will count the total number of possible outcomes and then count the number of outcomes where the non-negative difference is less than 3.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is $5 \\times 5 = 25$ since each of them has 5 options.\n\nNow, we count the number of outcomes where the non-negative difference is less than 3. \n\nWhen the difference between the two spins is 0, Jane wins. This can happen in 5 cases: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), and (5,5).\n\nWhen the difference is 1, Jane wins. This can happen in 8 cases: (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,3), (4,5), and (5,4).\n\nWhen the difference is 2, Jane wins. This can happen in 6 cases: (1,3), (3,1), (2,4), (4,2), (3,5), and (5,3).\n\nTherefore, the total number of outcomes where Jane wins is $5 + 8 + 6 = 19$.\n\nSince Jane wins in 19 out of 25 possible outcomes, the probability that Jane wins is $\\frac{19}{25}$."
