    "problem": "Define a $\\it{good\\ word}$ as a sequence of letters that consists only of the letters $A$, $B$, and $C$ --- some of these letters may not appear in the sequence --- and in which $A$ is never immediately followed by $B$, $B$ is never immediately followed by $C$, and $C$ is never immediately followed by $A$. How many seven-letter good words are there?",
    "solution": "There are three choices for the first letter and two choices for each subsequent letter, so there are $3\\cdot2^{n-1}\\ n$-letter good words.  Substitute $n=7$ to find there are $3\\cdot2^6=\\boxed{192}$ seven-letter good words.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of seven-letter good words, we can use a recursive approach. Consider the last letter of the word. It can be any of $A, B, C$. We will find the number of good words of length $n$ ending with each of these letters.\n\nFor a good word of length $n$ ending with $A$, we can append $A, C$ to the end. There are $x_n$ good words of length $n$ ending with $A$ and $y_n$ good words of length $n$ ending with $C$.\n\nFor a good word of length $n$ ending with $B$, we can append $A, B$ to the end. There are $x_n$ good words of length $n$ ending with $A$ and $y_n$ good words of length $n$ ending with $C$.\n\nFor a good word of length $n$ ending with $C$, we can append $B, C$ to the end. There are $x_n$ good words of length $n$ ending with $A$ and $y_n$ good words of length $n$ ending with $B$.\n\nSo we can write three equations:\n\n- $x_{n+1} = x_n + y_n$\n- $y_{n+1} = x_n + y_n$\n- $x_n$ and $y_n$ satisfy the initial conditions: $x_1=1, y_1=1$ (since there is only one one-letter good word) and $x_2=2, y_2=2$ (since there are two two-letter good words).\n\nThese three equations are the same, which means we only need to consider $x_n$ and $y_n$.\n\nSolving the equations with the initial conditions, we get:\n\n$x_n = y_n = F_{n+1}$\n\nwhere $F_n$ is the $n$th Fibonacci number.\n\nTherefore, the number of seven-letter good words is $F_8 = 21$."
