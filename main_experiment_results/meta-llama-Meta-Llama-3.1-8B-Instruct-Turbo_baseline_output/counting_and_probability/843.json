    "problem": "A bag contains 3 tan, 2 pink and 4 violet chips. If the 9 chips are randomly drawn from the bag, one at a time and without replacement, what is the probability that the chips are drawn in such a way that the 3 tan chips are drawn consecutively, the 2 pink chips are drawn consecutively, and the 4 violet chips are drawn consecutively, but not necessarily in the tan-pink-violet order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We count the number of ways to draw the tan chips consecutively, the pink chips consecutively, and the violet chips consecutively (although not necessarily in that order).  First of all, we can draw the tan chips in $3!$ ways, the pink chips in $2!$ ways, and the violet chips in $4!$ ways.  We can choose our drawing order (e.g pink-tan-violet) in $3!$ ways.  Thus we have $3!2!4!3!$ satisfying arrangements and $9!$ total ways of drawing the chips.  So our answer is $\\frac{3!2!4!3!}{9!} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{210}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To calculate the probability of drawing the chips in the specified order, we need to consider the different possible orders in which the color groups can be drawn consecutively.\n\nThere are 3! = 6 possible orders for the color groups, as we can arrange the three groups (tan, pink, violet) in any order. For example, tan-pink-violet, pink-tan-violet, violet-tan-pink, etc.\n\nNow, for each of these 6 orders, we need to calculate the number of ways to arrange the chips within each group. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the tan chips, 2! = 2 ways to arrange the pink chips, and 4! = 24 ways to arrange the violet chips.\n\nSince there are 6 possible orders for the color groups, and for each order there are 6 * 2 * 24 = 288 ways to arrange the chips within each group, the total number of ways to arrange the chips in the specified order is 6 * 288 = 1728.\n\nThe total number of ways to arrange the 9 chips without any restrictions is 9!. \n\nThe probability that the chips are drawn in the specified order is therefore 1728/9! = 1728/362880 = 1/210.\n\nSo, the probability that the chips are drawn in such a way that the 3 tan chips are drawn consecutively, the 2 pink chips are drawn consecutively, and the 4 violet chips are drawn consecutively, but not necessarily in the tan-pink-violet order is 1/210."
