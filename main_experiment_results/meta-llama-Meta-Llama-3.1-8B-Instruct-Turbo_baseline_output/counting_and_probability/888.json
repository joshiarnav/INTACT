    "solution": "Clearly one color isn't enough; $\\boxed{2}$ colors will work because the tessellation shown is topologically identical to a chessboard (that is, imagine straightening out the diagonal lines to form an array of squares. This process doesn't change which tiles share a side.).",

    "model_solution": "To find the least number of colors needed, we need to identify the pattern of the tessellation and how the tiles are connected. \n\nThe given tessellation is made up of hexagonal tiles arranged in a repeating pattern. Each tile shares sides with six neighboring tiles. \n\nTo color the tiles such that no two tiles sharing a side are the same color, we can start by coloring one tile. Since it shares sides with six neighboring tiles, we need at least two colors. If we color the first tile with color A, then we can color the neighboring tiles with color B, and vice versa.\n\nHowever, if we observe the pattern closely, we can see that the tessellation can be divided into two interlocking patterns of hexagons, with each hexagon sharing sides with its neighbors in a specific way. We can color the tiles in one pattern with color A and the tiles in the other pattern with color B.\n\nTherefore, the least number of colors needed to shade the tessellation is $\\boxed{2}$."
