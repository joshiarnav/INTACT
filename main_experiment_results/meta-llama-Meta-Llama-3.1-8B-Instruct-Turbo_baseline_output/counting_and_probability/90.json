    "problem": "If I roll 5 standard 6-sided dice and multiply the number on the face of each die, what is the probability that the result is a composite number?",
    "solution": "While it is almost tempting to make this into the casework problem to end all casework problems, using complementary probability makes the problem a lot simpler, so we will find the probability that the product is not composite.\n\nIt's clear that if more than one die shows a roll greater than 1, the resulting product will have more than one factor that is greater than 1 and therefore be composite. Additionally, if any of the dice show a 4 or a 6, the product will obviously be composite. So in order for the product to not be composite, we need at least four dice to be a 1 and the fifth die to either be another 1 or a 2, a 3, or a 5.\n\nThere's exactly one way in which all the the dice can be 1's, and for each of the other three cases there are 5 ways since the die that isn't a 1 can appear in any of the 5 other positions, so there are a total of $3\\cdot5+1=16$ ways of rolling the dice that result in a product that isn't composite. Additionally, there are 6 options for the roll of each of the 5 dice for a total of $6^5=7776$ possible outcomes, which means that the probability of the product not being composite is $\\dfrac{16}{7776}$ and the probability that it is composite is $1-\\frac{16}{7776}=\\frac{7760}{7776}=\\boxed{\\frac{485}{486}}$.\n\nNote: Many students have tried to argue that 1 is not a prime number and should not be counted. As we are doing complementary probability, it is important to consider all numbers that are not composite, and 1 is definitely not composite.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the result is a composite number, we need to find the probability that the result is not a composite number and then subtract that from 1.\n\nA composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. \n\nNow, let's find the probability of the product being a non-composite number. This means that at least four dice must show 1, and the fifth die must show either 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nThere are 6^5 possible outcomes when rolling 5 dice. \n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where at least four dice show 1. \n\n- All 5 dice show 1: There is 1 outcome (1,1,1,1,1).\n- Four dice show 1: There are 5 ways to choose the die that doesn't show 1. This die can show 2, 3, or 5. So, there are 3 * 5 = 15 outcomes.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where the fifth die shows 2, 3, or 5, and the other four dice show 1. \n\n- The fifth die shows 2: There is 1 outcome (1,1,1,1,2).\n- The fifth die shows 3: There is 1 outcome (1,1,1,1,3).\n- The fifth die shows 5: There is 1 outcome (1,1,1,1,5).\n\nSo, the number of outcomes where the product is not a composite number is 1 + 15 + 3 = 19.\n\nNow, let's find the probability that the product is not a composite number:\n\nP(not composite) = 19 / 6^5 = 19 / 7776 \u2248 0.245\n\nNow, let's find the probability that the product is a composite number:\n\nP(composite) = 1 - P(not composite) \u2248 1 - 0.245 \u2248 0.755\n\nHowever, this method counts some non-composite results multiple times. For example, the product can be 2^1*3^1, 2^1*3^1*1^3, and many more. \n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where at least three dice show 1, and the other two dice show 2, 3, or 5. \n\n- Three dice show 1, and the other two dice show 2: There are 10 ways to choose which 3 dice show 1, and there are 2 ways to choose the values of the other 2 dice. This makes 10 * 2 = 20 outcomes.\n- Three dice show 1, and the other two dice show 3: There are 10 ways to choose which 3 dice show 1, and there are 2 ways to choose the values of the other 2 dice. This makes 10 * 2 = 20 outcomes.\n- Three dice show 1, and the other two dice show 5: There are 10 ways to choose which 3 dice show 1, and there are 2 ways to choose the values of the other 2 dice. This makes 10 * 2 = 20 outcomes.\n\nSo, the number of outcomes where the product is not a composite number is 19 + 20 + 20 = 59. However, this still counts some non-composite results multiple times.\n\nWe could continue to add more cases to the number of non-composite results, but it would be easier to count the number of composite results directly.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where at least one die shows a number greater than 1. \n\n- At least one die shows 2: There are 6^4 ways to choose the value of each die, making 1296 outcomes.\n- At least one die shows 3: There are 6^4 ways to choose the value of each die, making 1296 outcomes.\n- At least one die shows 4: There are 6^4 ways to choose the value of each die, making 1296 outcomes.\n- At least one die shows 5: There are 6^4 ways to choose the value of each die, making 1296 outcomes.\n- At least one die shows 6: There are 6^4 ways to choose the value of each die, making 1296 outcomes.\n\nSo, the number of outcomes where at least one die shows a number greater than 1 is 59 + 6^4 * 5 = 59 + 7776 = 7835.\n\nHowever, this counts the outcomes where two dice show 2, and the other three dice show 1 multiple times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where two dice show 2, and the other three dice show 1. \n\n- Two dice show 2, and the other three dice show 1: There are 6 ways to choose the 2 dice that show 2. This makes 6 outcomes.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where three dice show 2, and the other two dice show 1. \n\n- Three dice show 2, and the other two dice show 1: There are 10 ways to choose the 3 dice that show 2. This makes 10 outcomes.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where three dice show 3, and the other two dice show 1. \n\nSimilarly, there are 10 ways to choose the 3 dice that show 3. This makes 10 outcomes.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where three dice show 5, and the other two dice show 1. \n\nSimilarly, there are 10 ways to choose the 3 dice that show 5. This makes 10 outcomes.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where two dice show 3, and the other three dice show 1. \n\n- Two dice show 3, and the other three dice show 1: There are 10 ways to choose the 2 dice are 3. This makes 10 outcomes.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where two dice show 4, and the other three dice show 1. \n\n- Two dice show 4, and the other three dice show 1: There are 10 ways to choose the 2 dice are 4. This makes 10 outcomes.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where two dice show 5, and the other three dice show 1. \n\n- Two dice show 5, and the other three dice show 1: There are 10 ways to choose the 2 dice are 5. This makes 10 outcomes.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where two dice show 6, and the other three dice show 1. \n\n- Two dice show 6, and the other three dice show 1: There are 10 ways to choose the 2 dice are 6. This makes 10 outcomes.\n\nSo, the number of outcomes where at least one die shows a number greater than 1 is 7835 - 6 - 10 - 10 - 10 - 10 - 10 - 10 = 7783.\n\nNow, let's find the probability that the product is a composite number:\n\nP(composite) = 1 - P(not composite) = 1 - (19 + 6^4 * 5 - 6 - 10 - 10 - 10 - 10 - 10 - 10 - 10 - 10 - 10 - 10 - 10) / 6^5\n= 1 - (19 + 7776 - 6 - 20 - 20 - 20 - 20 - 20 - 20 - 20 - 20 - 20 - 20 - 20 - 20) / 7776\n= 1 - (19 + 7746 - 340) / 7776\n= 1 - 7425 / 7776\n= 1 - 975 / 972\n= 1 - 25 / 72 / 4\n= 25 / 72 / 4 - 1\n= (25 - 72) / (72 * 4)\n= -47 / 288\n= 1 - 47 / 288\n= (288 - 47) / 288\n= 241 / 288\n\nHowever, this method still counts some composite results multiple times.\n\nWe could continue to add more cases to the number of composite results, but it would be easier to count the number of non-composite results directly.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where all dice show 1. \n\n- All 5 dice show 1: There is 1 outcome (1,1,1,1,1).\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where at least one die shows 2. \n\n- At least one die shows 2: There are 5^4 ways to choose the value of each die, making 625 outcomes.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where at least one die shows 3. \n\n- At least one die shows 3: There are 5^4 ways to choose the value of each die, making 625 outcomes.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where at least one die shows 4. \n\n- At least one die shows 4: There are 5^4 ways to choose the value of each die, making 625 outcomes.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where at least one die shows 5. \n\n- At least one die shows 5: There are 5^4 ways to"
