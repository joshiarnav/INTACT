    "problem": "When two fair 6-sided dice are tossed, the numbers $a$ and $b$ are obtained. What is the probability that the two digit number $ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) and $a$ and $b$ are all divisible by 3?",
    "solution": "$ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) is divisible by 3 only when $a+b$ is divisible by 3. Since 3 divides both $a$ and $a+b$, 3 must divide $b$. Therefore, $a$ and $b$ can equal 3 or 6. The probability that $a$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. The probability that $b$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. Therefore, The probability that both $a$ and $b$ equal 3 or 6 is $\\left(\\frac13\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac19}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the two-digit number $ab$ and $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 3, we must consider the possible values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy this condition. \n\nSince both $a$ and $b$ are digits of the number $ab$, they must be integers between 1 and 6, inclusive.\n\nWe want $ab$ to be divisible by 3. This is equivalent to the condition that $3$ divides both $a$ and $b$. The possible values for $a$ and $b$ that are divisible by 3 are 3 and 6.\n\nThe possible pairs for $(a,b)$ are: \n- (3,3)\n- (3,6)\n- (6,3)\n- (6,6)\n\nSince each pair of dice has a probability of $\\frac{1}{36}$ of being rolled, the probability that the two-digit number $ab$ and $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 3 is equal to $\\frac{1}{36} \\cdot 4$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the two-digit number $ab$ and $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 3 is $\\frac{4}{36} = \\frac{1}{9}$."
