    "solution": "The hexagons in the second column to the left must be yellow and green, but either color can be on top: 2 possibilities. With either possibility, the rest of the figure is easily colored in, with the color of every other hexagon being forced.  (ex. In the third column, the middle hexagon must be red, and the top and bottom must be the opposite of the top and bottom in the second column)  Thus, there are only $\\boxed{2}$ possibilities.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can start by coloring the hexagon adjacent to the given red hexagon. This hexagon must be yellow. From there, we can work our way outwards.\n\nThe adjacent hexagons to the right of the red one can be colored green. We then move on to the next row of hexagons. The hexagons adjacent to the red hexagon can be colored green. \n\nNow we come to the top hexagon of the figure. This one can be either yellow or green. However, since the adjacent hexagon is colored yellow and the adjacent one to the left of the yellow is colored green, the top hexagon must be green. \n\nThe middle hexagon of the figure can be colored red or yellow. We can then fill in the remaining hexagons using the available colors. \n\nConsidering the options for the middle hexagon, we can see that there are 2 possible ways to color the figure."
