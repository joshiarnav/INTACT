    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll use the Pythagorean Theorem in the right triangles that are formed within the larger isosceles triangle. \n\nLet's first draw the altitude from point C to line AB, which intersects AB at point E. Since triangle ACE and triangle BCE are right triangles with the same hypotenuse length (AC = BC = 7), we can conclude that angle ACE is congruent to angle BCE. Thus, triangle ACE and triangle BCE are congruent by the Hypotenuse-Leg congruence theorem. \n\nThis implies that AE = BE = 1, since the altitude from C to AB divides AB in half.\n\nNow, let's use the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle CED. Since we have the lengths of the hypotenuse (CD = 8) and one leg (CE = 3), we can find the length of the other leg, which is BD.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem, we have:\n\n$(BD)^2 = (CD)^2 - (CE)^2$\n$(BD)^2 = 8^2 - 3^2$\n$(BD)^2 = 64 - 9$\n$(BD)^2 = 55$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$BD = \\sqrt{55}$\n\nSo, the length of BD is $\\sqrt{55}$."
