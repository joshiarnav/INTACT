    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ has vertices at $A(5,8)$, $B(3,-2)$, and $C(6,1)$. The point $D$ with coordinates $(m,n)$ is chosen inside the triangle so that the three small triangles $ABD$, $ACD$ and $BCD$ all have equal areas. What is the value of $10m + n$?",
    "solution": "If $D$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, then $ABD$, $ACD$, and $BCD$ would all have equal areas (to see this, remember that the medians of a triangle divide the triangle into 6 equal areas). There is only one point with this property (if we move around $D$, the area of one of the small triangles will increase and will no longer be $1/3$ of the total area). So $D$ must be the centroid of triangle $ABC$. The $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the centroid are found by averaging the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively, of the vertices, so $(m,n) = \\left( \\frac{5+3+6}{3}, \\frac{8+(-2)+1}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{14}{3}, \\frac{7}{3} \\right)$, and $10m + n = 10 \\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right) + \\frac{7}{3} = \\boxed{49}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the point $D$ inside the triangle so that the three small triangles $ABD$, $ACD$, and $BCD$ all have equal areas, we note that $D$ must be the centroid of the triangle. The centroid is the point of intersection of the three medians of the triangle, and it divides each median into two segments, one of which is two-thirds the entire median, and the other of which is one-third the entire median.\n\nTo find the centroid, we can find the average of the $x$-coordinates and the average of the $y$-coordinates of the vertices.\n\nThe average of the $x$-coordinates is $(5 + 3 + 6)/3 = 14/3$.\n\nThe average of the $y$-coordinates is $(8 + (-2) + 1)/3 = 7/3$.\n\nSo, the coordinates of the centroid are $(14/3, 7/3)$, and $m = 14/3$ and $n = 7/3$.\n\nNow, we can find the value of $10m + n$:\n\n$10m + n = 10(14/3) + 7/3 = 140/3 + 7/3 = 147/3 = 49$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $10m + n$ is 49."
