    "model_solution": "To find $\\angle QRC$, we can use the properties of incenter $C$ of the triangle $PQR$.\n\nSince $C$ is the incenter of the triangle $PQR$, it is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle. Therefore, the segments from $C$ to each of the three sides are perpendicular to these sides. This means that $C$ is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect, and it is the center of the incircle.\n\nLet's denote $\\angle QRC$ as $x$. Since $\\angle QPR = 59^\\circ$, the other two angles of triangle $PQC$ must add up to $180^\\circ - 59^\\circ = 121^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle PQC = 121^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 31^\\circ$.\n\nSimilarly, let's denote $\\angle PRD$ as $y$. Since $\\angle PQR = 63^\\circ$, the other two angles of triangle $PRD$ must add up to $180^\\circ - 63^\\circ = 117^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle PRD = 117^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 27^\\circ$.\n\nSince $\\angle QPR = \\frac{1}{2} \\angle QPR$ and $\\angle PQR = \\frac{1}{2} \\angle PQR$, the angles at point $C$ in triangle $PQC$ are $59^\\circ/2=29.5$ and in triangle $PRD$ is $63^\\circ/2=31.5$.\n\nNow, since $\\angle QRC$ and $\\angle PRD$ form a straight line at point $R$, their sum must be $180^\\circ$. So, we have $x + 27^\\circ = 180^\\circ$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 153^\\circ$.\n\nHowever, this answer is impossible since the angle is part of a triangle with the other two angles being $31.5$ and $29.5$. We made an error.\n\nTo find $\\angle QRC$, let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's consider the triangle $QCR$. Since $C$ is the incenter of triangle $PQR$, the segments from $C$ to each of the three sides are perpendicular to these sides. Therefore, the angle $\\angle QCR$ is a right angle, which is $90^\\circ$.\n\nNow, let's consider the angles of triangle $QCR$. Since $\\angle PQR = 63^\\circ$, the other two angles of triangle $QCR$ must add up to $180^\\circ - 63^\\circ = 117^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle QCR = 117^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 27^\\circ$.\n\nHowever, this answer still doesn't seem right. We still made an error somewhere.\n\nLet's take a different approach.\n\nSince the radius of the incircle is perpendicular to all three sides of the triangle and since $\\angle QPR = 59^\\circ$, we know that the angle between the radius of the incircle and the side $PQ$ is $31^\\circ$.\n\nWe also know that the radius of the incircle bisects the side $PQ$. Therefore, the angle between the radius of the incircle and the side $QR$ is also $31^\\circ$.\n\nThis makes $\\angle QRC$ equal to $180^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 31^\\circ - 31^\\circ = \\boxed{28}$ degrees."
