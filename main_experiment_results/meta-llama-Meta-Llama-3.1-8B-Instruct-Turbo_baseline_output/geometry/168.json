    "problem": "A square and a circle intersect so that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle. What is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "Drawing a diagram and adding $OM$ perpendicular to $AD$, we get\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-1,1);\nB=(1,1);\nC=(1,-1);\nD=(-1,-1);\nE=(-1,-.577);\nF=(-1,.577);\nM=(-1,0);\ndraw(circle(O,1.155));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--A);\ndraw(F--O);\ndraw(O--E);\ndraw(O--M);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"F\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, dir(0));\nlabel(\"M\", M, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (F+O)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (E+O)/2, SE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", M, W);\n[/asy] First note that $O$ is not only the center of the circle but also the center of the square since the diagram is symmetric. Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can start by drawing a diagram of the situation.\n\nSince each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle, the center of the circle must coincide with the center of the square.\n\nLet the radius of the circle be $r$. Then, the diameter of the circle is $2r$. Since the diameter of the circle is equal to the diagonal of the square, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the side length of the square.\n\nLet the side length of the square be $s$. Then, we have\n\n$$s^2+s^2=(2r)^2$$\n\nUsing the fact that $s^2+s^2=2s^2$, we can rewrite the equation as\n\n$$2s^2=4r^2$$\n\nDividing both sides by $2$, we get\n\n$$s^2=2r^2$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get\n\n$$s=\\sqrt{2}r$$\n\nNow, we can find the area of the square and the area of the circle.\n\nThe area of the square is $s^2=(\\sqrt{2}r)^2=2r^2$.\n\nThe area of the circle is $\\pi r^2$.\n\nTo find the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle, we can divide the area of the square by the area of the circle:\n\n$$\\frac{2r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{2}{\\pi}$$\n\nSo, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$."
