    "problem": "A circle centered at $O$ is circumscribed about $\\triangle ABC$ as follows: [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pO;\npO = (0, 0);\npA = pO + dir(-20);\npB = pO + dir(90);\npC = pO + dir(190);\ndraw(pA--pB--pC--pA);\ndraw(pO--pA);\ndraw(pO--pB);\ndraw(pO--pC);\nlabel(\"$O$\", pO, S);\nlabel(\"$110^\\circ$\", pO, NE);\nlabel(\"$100^\\circ$\", pO, NW);\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, SE);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, N);\nlabel(\"$C$\", pC, SW);\ndraw(circle(pO, 1));\n[/asy] What is the measure of $\\angle BAC$, in degrees?",
    "solution": "We can see that $\\angle AOC = 360^\\circ - (110^\\circ + 100^\\circ) = 150^\\circ.$ Now, $\\triangle AOC$ and $\\triangle AOB$ are both isosceles triangles. That means that $\\angle OAC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (180^\\circ - 150^\\circ) = 15^\\circ$ and $\\angle OAB = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (180^\\circ - 110^\\circ) = 35^\\circ.$  Therefore, our answer is $\\angle BAC = \\angle OAB + \\angle OAC = 15^\\circ + 35^\\circ = \\boxed{50^\\circ}.$",

    "model_solution": "The measure of the arc between points A and B is 110 degrees. Since the central angle and the inscribed angle are equal for a circle, we can find the measure of angle BAC. \n\nLet's call the measure of angle BAC x. Since the measure of the inscribed angle is half of the central angle, the measure of the arc between points A and B is 2x. \n\n2x = 110\n\nx = 55\n\nThe measure of angle BAC is 55 degrees."
