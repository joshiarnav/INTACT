    "problem": "Jimmy owns a cube-shaped container that measures $10$ inches on each side. He fills this container with water until it is half full. Then he throws ten giant ice cubes that measure $2$ inches on each side into the container. In inches cubed, how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water?",
    "solution": "First let's compute the volume of the container. The container measures $10\\times10\\times10$ so its volume is  $$10\\cdot10\\cdot10=10^3=1000$$inches cubed. Since the container is only half full, there are $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10^3=500$$inches cubed of water in it. Additionally, there are ten ice cubes each with a volume of $2^3$. This means that the total volume of the ice cubes is $$10\\cdot2^3=10\\cdot8=80.$$Altogether, the water and the ice cubes occupy $500+80=580$ inches cubed. This means that there are $1000-580=\\boxed{420}$ inches cubed of space in the container unoccupied by water and ice.",

    "model_solution": "To find out how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water, we need to first calculate the total volume of the container, the volume occupied by water, and the volume occupied by the ice cubes.\n\nThe total volume of the cube-shaped container is given by the formula: \nVolume = side^3\nHere, the side of the cube is 10 inches.\nSo, Volume = 10^3 = 1000 cubic inches.\n\nSince Jimmy fills the container until it is half full, the volume of water will be half of the total volume of the container.\nVolume of water = 1000 / 2 = 500 cubic inches.\n\nNow, let's calculate the volume occupied by the ice cubes. Each ice cube is a cube with a side of 2 inches.\nVolume of one ice cube = 2^3 = 8 cubic inches.\nThere are ten ice cubes, so the total volume occupied by the ice cubes is:\nVolume of ice cubes = 10 * 8 = 80 cubic inches.\n\nThe total volume occupied by ice and water is the sum of the volume of water and the volume of ice cubes.\nTotal occupied volume = 500 (water) + 80 (ice cubes) = 580 cubic inches.\n\nThe volume of the container unoccupied by ice or water is the difference between the total volume of the container and the total occupied volume.\nUnoccupied volume = 1000 (total volume) - 580 (occupied volume) = 420 cubic inches.\n\nTherefore, the container is 420 cubic inches unoccupied by ice or water."
