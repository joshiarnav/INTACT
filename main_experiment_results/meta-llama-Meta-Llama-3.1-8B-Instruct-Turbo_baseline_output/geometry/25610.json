    "problem": "The sum of the lengths of the twelve edges of a rectangular box is $140$, and the distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner is $21$. What is the total surface area of the box?",
    "solution": "Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the dimensions of the box. It is given that \\[140=4a+4b+4c{\\qquad \\rm and\n\\qquad}21=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}\\] hence \\[35=a+b+c{\\qquad (1)\\qquad\n\\rm and\\qquad}441=a^2+b^2+c^2{\\qquad (2)}.\\]\n\nSquare both sides of $(1)$ and combine with $(2)$ to obtain \\begin{align*}\n1225 & = (a+b+c)^2 \\\\\n&= a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2bc+2ca \\\\\n&= 441+2ab+2bc+2ca.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus the surface area of the box is \\[ 2ab+2bc+2ca=1225-441=\\boxed{784}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To solve the problem, let's denote the length, width, and height of the rectangular box as l, w, and h respectively.\n\nGiven the sum of the lengths of the twelve edges of the box is 140, the equation becomes 4l + 4w + 4h = 140. This simplifies to l + w + h = 35.\n\nThe distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner is given by the formula \u221a(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2) = 21. Squaring both sides of this equation we get l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 = 441.\n\nWe can express the surface area of the box as 2lw + 2lh + 2wh.\n\nIt can be noticed that we have (l + w + h)\u00b2 = l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 + 2lw + 2lh + 2wh. We can then substitute the value of l + w + h and l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 obtained earlier into this equation. \n\n(l + w + h)\u00b2 = (35)\u00b2 = 1225\nl\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 + 2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 1225\n441 + 2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 1225\n2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 784\n\nSo, the total surface area of the box is 784."
