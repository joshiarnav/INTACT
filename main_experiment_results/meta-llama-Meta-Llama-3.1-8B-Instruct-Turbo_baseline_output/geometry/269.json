    "solution": "We draw the longest altitude of this triangle, which breaks the triangle into two right triangles.   [asy]\nsize(100);\npair A,B,C,D;\nA=(0,0); B=(8,0); C=(4,sqrt(65)); D=(4,0);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle); draw(C--D);\ndraw(rightanglemark(C,D,A,18));\nlabel(\"8\",D,S); label(\"9\",(A+C)/2,W); label(\"9\",(B+C)/2,E);\n[/asy] The right triangles are congruent because the original triangle is isosceles; each right triangle has one leg length $8/2=4$ and hypotenuse length 9.  The other leg, which is also the height of the original triangle, has length $\\sqrt{9^2-4^2}=\\sqrt{65}$.  Thus, the original triangle has base length 8, height $\\sqrt{65}$, and area \\[\\frac{1}{2}(8)(\\sqrt{65})=\\boxed{4\\sqrt{65}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the triangle, we can use Heron's formula. \n\nHeron's formula states that the area (A) of a triangle whose side lengths are a, b, and c is given by:\n\nA = sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c))\n\nwhere s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, given by:\n\ns = (a + b + c) / 2\n\nIn this case, the side lengths are 8, 9, and 9. \n\nFirst, we find the semi-perimeter (s) of the triangle:\ns = (8 + 9 + 9) / 2\ns = 26 / 2\ns = 13\n\nNow we can use Heron's formula to find the area (A) of the triangle:\nA = sqrt(13(13 - 8)(13 - 9)(13 - 9))\nA = sqrt(13 * 5 * 4 * 4)\nA = sqrt(13 * 80)\nA = sqrt(1040)\nA = 32.12 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 32.12 square units. \n\nThis is an example of an isosceles triangle, where two sides have the same length."
