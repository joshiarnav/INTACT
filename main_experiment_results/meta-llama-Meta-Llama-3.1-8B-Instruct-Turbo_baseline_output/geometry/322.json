    "problem": "The radius of a cylinder is doubled and its height is tripled. If its original volume was 10 cubic feet, what is its volume now, in cubic feet?",
    "solution": "Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively.  The new cylinder has volume \\[\n\\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\\pi r^2 h,\n\\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume.  Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.",

    "model_solution": "The original volume of the cylinder is 10 cubic feet. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nIf the radius is doubled (2r) and the height is tripled (3h), the new volume V' can be calculated as follows:\n\nV' = \u03c0(2r)\u00b2(3h)\nV' = 12\u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nSince the original volume V was 10 cubic feet, we can set up a proportion to find the new volume V':\n\nV' = 12V\nV' = 12(10)\nV' = 120\n\nSo, the volume of the cylinder is now 120 cubic feet."
