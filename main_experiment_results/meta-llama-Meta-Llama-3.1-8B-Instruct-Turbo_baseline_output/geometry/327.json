Hence, the perimeter of the quadrilateral is \\[\\frac a2 + 2a + \\frac{3a}2 + a\\sqrt{5} = \\left(4+\\sqrt5\\right)a,\\]and when this is divided by $a,$ we get $\\boxed{4+\\sqrt{5}}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the perimeter of one of the congruent quadrilaterals, we first need to determine the points where the line $y = x/2$ intersects the sides of the square.\n\nThe line intersects the right side of the square at $x = a$, and the left side at $x = -a$. \n\nWhen $x = a$, $y = \\frac{a}{2}$. \nWhen $x = -a$, $y = -\\frac{a}{2}$.\n\nThe line also intersects the top side of the square. We can find this intersection point using the fact that the line passes through the point $(a, -a)$.\nWe know the equation of the line is $y = \\frac{x}{2}$. Since the line passes through the point $(a, -a)$, we have:\n$-a = \\frac{a}{2}$, which does not hold. Therefore, let's instead find where the line intersects the top side. \nThe point of intersection between the line $y = \\frac{x}{2}$ and the top of the square ($y = a$) is given by $\\frac{x}{2} = a$. Solving this equation, we find that $x = 2a$. However, since this point $x = 2a$ is outside the boundaries of the square, it is not a valid intersection point between the line and the top side of the square.\n\nNow we need to find the intersection point between the line $y = \\frac{x}{2}$ and the bottom side of the square ($y = -a$). \nThe point of intersection between the line $y = \\frac{x}{2}$ and the bottom of the square ($y = -a$) is given by $\\frac{x}{2} = -a$. Solving this equation, we find that $x = -2a$. However, since this point $x = -2a$ is outside the boundaries of the square, it is not a valid intersection point between the line and the bottom side of the square.\n\nSince the line does not intersect the top side of the square at a point within the square, the line only intersects the right and left sides of the square. The line $y = \\frac{x}{2}$ intersects the right side at $(a, \\frac{a}{2})$ and the left side at $(-a, -\\frac{a}{2})$. \n\nWe know that the line intersects the right side at $x = a$. Similarly, the line intersects the left side at $x = -a$. \n\nWhen $x = a$, $y = \\frac{a}{2}$. \nWhen $x = -a$, $y = -\\frac{a}{2}$.\n\nThe intersection points on the right and left sides are $(a, \\frac{a}{2})$ and $(-a, -\\frac{a}{2})$ respectively.\n\nThe perimeter of one of the congruent quadrilaterals is given by the sum of the lengths of its sides. \n\nThe line segment from $(-a, -a)$ to $(a, -a )$ has length $2a$. \n\nThe line segment from $(a, -a)$ to $(a, \\frac{a}{2})$ has length $a + \\frac{a}{2} = \\frac{3a}{2}$.\n\nThe line segment from $(a, \\frac{a}{2})$ to $(a, a)$ has length $\\frac{a}{2}$.\n\nThe line segment from $(-a, -\\frac{a}{2})$ to $(-a, -a)$ has length $-\\frac{a}{2} + a = \\frac{a}{2}$.\n\nThe line segment from $(-a, a)$ to $(a, \\frac{a}{2})$ has length $\\sqrt{(a-(-a))^2 + (a - \\frac{a}{2})^2} = \\sqrt{(2a)^2 + (\\frac{a}{2})^2} = \\sqrt{4a^2 + \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{17a^2}{4}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{17}}{2}$.\n\nThe perimeter of one of the congruent quadrilaterals is $2a + \\frac{3a}{2} + \\frac{a}{2} + \\frac{a}{2} + \\frac{a\\sqrt{17}}{2} = 2a + \\frac{3a}{2} + a = 4a + \\frac{3a}{2} = \\frac{11a}{2} + \\frac{a\\sqrt{17}}{2}$.\n\nFinally, dividing the perimeter of one of these congruent quadrilaterals ($\\frac{11a}{2} + \\frac{a\\sqrt{17}}{2}$) by $a$, we get $\\frac{\\frac{11a}{2} + \\frac{a\\sqrt{17}}{2}}{a} = \\frac{11}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{17}}{2} = \\frac{11 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{11+\\sqrt{17}}{2}}$."
