    "solution": "To start, we can draw in a line from where the altitude meets the base to one of the bottom corners as shown:\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(13,3)--(10,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(6.5,15)--(3,3),linewidth(1));\ndraw((13,3)--(6.5,15)--(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,15)--(6.5,1.5),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,1.5)--(10,0),linewidth(.7));\n[/asy]\n\nThe length of this segment will be half the length of the diagonal of the base.  The base has side $10$, so the diagonal will satisfy: $$d^2=10^2+10^2=200$$ $$d=10\\sqrt{2}$$ Half of this is $5\\sqrt{2}$.  Now we can look at the right triangle formed by the altitude from the vertex of the pyramid, the line just drawn in, and with hypotenuse as the edge we need to find the length of.  The length of this edge is: $$\\sqrt{12^2+(5\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{144+50}=\\sqrt{194}\\approx 13.928$$ The total length of all edges is: $$4(10)+4(13.928)\\approx \\boxed{ 96}$$",

    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the lengths of the pyramid's eight edges, we need to find the lengths of the four edges on the base and the four edges from the base to the peak.\n\nThe lengths of the edges on the base are all equal, since the base is a square. There are four edges on the base, and since each edge is 10 cm long, their total length is $4 \\times 10 = 40$ cm.\n\nTo find the lengths of the edges from the base to the peak, we need to consider the right triangles formed by the peak, the center of the base, and one of the vertices of the base. Each of these right triangles has a base of 5 cm (half the diagonal of the base, since the diagonal of the base is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 10 cm) and a height of 12 cm (the distance from the base to the peak). \n\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem, we can calculate the length of the hypotenuse of one of these triangles, which is also the length of an edge from the base to the peak. The length is given by\n\n$$\\sqrt{5^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 144} = \\sqrt{169} = 13 \\text{ cm}.$$\n\nSince there are four edges from the base to the peak, their total length is $4 \\times 13 = 52$ cm.\n\nThe sum of the lengths of all eight edges is the sum of the lengths of the four edges on the base and the four edges from the base to the peak, which is $40 + 52 = 92$ cm.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the lengths of the pyramid's eight edges is 92 cm, which rounded to the nearest whole number is 92."
