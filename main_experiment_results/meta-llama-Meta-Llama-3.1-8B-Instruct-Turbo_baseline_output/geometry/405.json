    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ has a perimeter of 2007 units. The sides have lengths that are all integer values with $AB< BC \\leq AC$. What is the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$?",
    "solution": "Since $AB$ and $BC$ are positive integers and $AB < BC$, $BC - AB$ must be at least 1.\n\nThe triangle with side lengths $AB = 650$, $BC = 651$, and $AC = 706$ satisfies the given conditions, and for this triangle $BC - AB = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. \n\nGiven that $AB < BC \\leq AC$ and the perimeter of triangle $ABC$ is 2007, we can express the sum of the three sides as $AB + BC + AC = 2007$.\n\nSince $AB < BC$, the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$ is 1. \n\nThe next step is to ensure that $AB + BC > AC$ and $BC + AC > AB$ and $AC + AB > BC$. \n\nThe smallest integer $AB$ and $BC$ could be is 668 and 669, respectively. In this case, $AB + BC = 133$, which is not greater than $AC$. \n\nHowever, if we let $AB = 668$ and $BC = 669$, then the largest possible value of $AC$ is $2007 - 1337 = 670$. \n\n$AB + BC > AC$ and $BC + AC > AB$ and $AC + AB > BC$. \n\n$BC - AB$ is 1, and it is the smallest possible value. \n\nThe final answer is 1."
