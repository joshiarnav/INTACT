Now, we have a regular tetrahedron $EFGH$, which by symmetry has twice the volume of our original solid. This tetrahedron has side length $2s = 12\\sqrt{2}$. Using the formula for the volume of a regular tetrahedron, which is $V = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}S^3}{12}$, where S is the side length of the tetrahedron, the volume of our original solid is:\n$V = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot (12\\sqrt{2})^3}{12} = \\boxed{288}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of the given solid, we need to break it down into simpler shapes. The solid can be divided into two triangular prisms. \n\nThe first prism is formed by the square base $ABCD$ and the top edge $EF$ parallel to the base. The height of this prism is $s/2$ since edge $AE$ and $DF$ are both $s/2$ units longer than edge $AD$.\n\nThe second prism is formed by the square base $ABCD$ and the diagonal edge $BC$ of the base. The height of this prism is the perpendicular distance from point $F$ to the plane of the base $ABCD$. \n\nTo find this height, we need to find the foot of the altitude from point $F$ to the plane of the base $ABCD$. Let's call this foot $G$. Then, we can form right triangles $FGG'$ and $GG'C$ where $G'$ is the foot of the altitude from point $F$ to edge $BC$.\n\nThe right triangle $FGG'$ is a $45-45-90$ triangle as the base $FG$ is $s/2$, as seen in the diagram. Therefore, $FG = s/2$ and $GG' = s/2$. \n\nThe right triangle $GG'C$ is also a $45-45-90$ triangle as the base $GG' = s/2$. Therefore, $G'C = s/2$ and $GC = s$. \n\nSince $G'$ is the midpoint of edge $BC$, we have $BC = 2GG' = s$. We have found that $G'C = s/2$ and $GC = s$. Therefore, the height of the second prism is $s/2$.\n\nWe can find the volume of the first prism using the formula for the volume of a triangular prism, which is $\\frac{1}{2}bh\\ell$, where $b$ is the base area, $h$ is the height, and $\\ell$ is the length of the other side of the triangular prism. In this case, the base area is $s^2$, the height is $s/2$, and the length of the other side is $s$. \n\nThe volume of the first prism is $\\frac{1}{2}s^2(s/2)s = \\frac{s^4}{4}$.\n\nWe can find the volume of the second prism using the same formula. The base area is $s^2$, the height is $s/2$, and the length of the other side is $s$. \n\nThe volume of the second prism is $\\frac{1}{2}s^2(s/2)s = \\frac{s^4}{4}$.\n\nThe total volume of the solid is the sum of the volumes of the two prisms. Therefore, the total volume of the solid is $\\frac{s^4}{4}+\\frac{s^4}{4}=\\frac{2s^4}{4}=\\frac{s^4}{2}$.\n\nWe are given that $s = 6\\sqrt{2}$. Substituting this into the formula for the volume, we get:\n\n$\\frac{s^4}{2} = \\frac{(6\\sqrt{2})^4}{2} = \\frac{6^4(2)^4}{2} = \\frac{1296\\cdot 16}{2} = \\frac{20736}{2} = 10368$"
