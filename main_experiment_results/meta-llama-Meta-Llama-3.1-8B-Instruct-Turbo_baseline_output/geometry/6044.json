By the Two Tangent Theorem, $AP = AQ = 23$, $BP = BR = 27$, and $CQ = CR = x$. Using $rs = A$, where $s = \\frac{27 \\cdot 2 + 23 \\cdot 2 + x \\cdot 2}{2} = 50 + x$, we get $(21)(50 + x) = A$. By Heron's formula, $A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{(50+x)(x)(23)(27)}$. Equating and squaring both sides,\n\\begin{eqnarray*}  [21(50+x)]^2 &=& (50+x)(x)(621)\\\\ 441(50+x) &=& 621x\\\\ 180x = 441 \\cdot 50 &\\Longrightarrow & x = \\frac{245}{2}   \\end{eqnarray*}\nWe want the perimeter, which is $2s = 2\\left(50 + \\frac{245}{2}\\right) = \\boxed{345}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's denote the center of the inscribed circle as $O$, and the points where the circle is tangent to the sides of triangle $ABC$ as $P$, $Q$, and $R$.\n\nSince the circle is tangent to $AB$ at $P$ and has a radius of $21$, we have $AP = 23$ and $PB = 27$.\n\nWe know that the radius of the circle is $21$, so the distance from $O$ to $P$ is $21$, and the distance from $O$ to $Q$ is also $21$. The same applies to the other sides of the triangle.\n\nNow, let's denote the distance from $P$ to $Q$ as $x$, and the distance from $Q$ to $R$ as $y$. The distance from $R$ to $P$ is then $x+y$.\n\nSince the radius of the circle is $21$, we have $x = 27 - 21 = 6$.\n\nNow, let's find the distance from $Q$ to $R$.\n\nWe know that the length of $AB$ is $AP + PB = 23 + 27 = 50$.\n\nSince the circle is tangent to $AB$ at $P$, we have $OP = 21$.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle $PQR$, we have $PR^2 = PQ^2 + QR^2$.\n\nWe know that $PQ = 6$ and $OP = 21$, so $OR = 21$, and $QR = 21$.\n\nWe also know that the length of $AB$ is $50$, so the length of $BC$ is also $50$.\n\nNow, let's find the length of $AC$.\n\nWe know that the length of $BC$ is $50$, and the length of $BQ$ is $21$, so the length of $QC$ is $50 - 21 = 29$.\n\nWe also know that the length of $CQ$ is $29$, and the length of $PQ$ is $6$, so the length of $PC$ is $29 - 6 = 23$.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle $PAC$, we have $PA^2 = PC^2 + AC^2$.\n\nWe know that $PA = 23$ and $PC = 23$, so we can find $AC = \\sqrt{PA^2 - PC^2} = \\sqrt{23^2 - 23^2} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{0}}$ \n...$AC$ will be 0 so $AC$ is 0 \n$AB$ is 50 and $BC$ is 50... \nNow, we can find the perimeter of the triangle, $AB+BC+AC = 50 + 50 + 0 = 100$. The answer is 100"
