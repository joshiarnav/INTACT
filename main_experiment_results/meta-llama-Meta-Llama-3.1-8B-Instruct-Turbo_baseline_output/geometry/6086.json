    "problem": "Square $ABCD$ has sides of length 2. Set $S$ is the set of all line segments that have length 2 and whose endpoints are on adjacent sides of the square. The midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ enclose a region whose area to the nearest hundredth is $k$. Find $100k$.\n",
    "solution": "Without loss of generality, let $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, $(0,2)$, and $(2,2)$ be the vertices of the square. Suppose the endpoints of the segment lie on the two sides of the square determined by the vertex $(0,0)$. Let the two endpoints of the segment have coordinates $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$. Because the segment has length 2, $x^2+y^2=4$. Using the midpoint formula, we find that the midpoint of the segment has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Let $d$ be the distance from $(0,0)$ to $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Using the distance formula we see that $d=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2}= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}\\left(x^2+y^2\\right)}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}(4)}=1$. Thus the midpoints lying on the sides determined by vertex $(0,0)$ form a quarter-circle with radius 1.\n[asy] size(100); pointpen=black;pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); pair A=(0,0),B=(2,0),C=(2,2),D=(0,2); D(A--B--C--D--A);  picture p; draw(p,CR(A,1));draw(p,CR(B,1));draw(p,CR(C,1));draw(p,CR(D,1)); clip(p,A--B--C--D--cycle); add(p); [/asy]\nThe set of all midpoints forms a quarter circle at each corner of the square. The area enclosed by all of the midpoints is $4-4\\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=4-\\pi \\approx .86$ to the nearest hundredth. Thus $100\\cdot k=\\boxed{86}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area enclosed by the midpoints of the line segments in set $S$, we need to understand the shape formed by these midpoints. \n\nConsider the square $ABCD$ with side length 2. For any line segment in set $S$, we can draw its two possible midpoints using its two sets of endpoints. \n\nWe can visualize the shape enclosed by these midpoints by considering the midpoints of the line segments whose endpoints are on the two adjacent sides $AB$ and $BC$. The midpoints of these line segments form a quarter circle with a radius of 1. \n\nBy symmetry, the midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ form four quarter circles, each with a radius of 1, at the four corners of the square $ABCD$. \n\nThe area enclosed by the midpoints is the area of the square minus the areas of the four quarter circles. \n\nThe area of the square $ABCD$ is $2^2 = 4$. \n\nThe area of each quarter circle is $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi r^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\pi(1)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$. \n\nSince there are four quarter circles, the total area enclosed by the midpoints is $4 - 4 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{4} = 4 - \\pi \\approx 0.86$ (rounded to the nearest hundredth).\n\nTherefore, $k \\approx 0.86$, and $100k \\approx 86$."
