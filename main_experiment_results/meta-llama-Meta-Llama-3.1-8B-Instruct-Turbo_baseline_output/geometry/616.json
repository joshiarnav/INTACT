    "problem": "A triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units. The length of the third side is $x$ units, where $x$ is an integer. What is the largest possible perimeter of the triangle?",
    "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to find the largest possible value of the third side, x.\n\nAccording to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. \n\nSo, we have:\n- 5 + 6 > x (11 > x)\n- 5 + x > 6 (x > 1)\n- 6 + x > 5 (x > -1, but since x is positive, this is always satisfied)\n\nCombining the first two inequalities, we get 1 < x < 11. Since x is an integer, the largest possible value of x is 10.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible perimeter of the triangle is 5 + 6 + 10 = 21 units."
