    "solution": "The three arcs make up the entire circle, so the circumference of the circle is $3+4+5=12$ and the radius is $\\frac{12}{2\\pi}=\\frac{6}{\\pi}$. Also, the lengths of the arcs are proportional to their corresponding central angles. Thus, we can write the values of the arcs as $3\\theta$, $4\\theta$, and $5\\theta$ for some $\\theta$. By Circle Angle Sum, we obtain $3\\theta+4\\theta+5\\theta=360$. Solving yields $\\theta=30$. Thus, the angles of the triangle are $90$, $120$, and $150$. Using $[ABC]=\\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin{C}$, we obtain $\\frac{r^2}{2}(\\sin{90}+\\sin{120}+\\sin{150})$. Substituting $\\frac{6}{\\pi}$ for $r$ and evaluating yields $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{\\pi^2}(\\sqrt{3}+3)}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the triangle, we can use the Extended Law of Sines. \n\nThe Extended Law of Sines states that in a triangle inscribed in a circle of radius R, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is equal to 2R.\n\nLet's denote the central angles opposite to the sides of lengths 3, 4, and 5 as A, B, and C, respectively.\n\nUsing the Law of Sines, we can calculate the area of the triangle as follows:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (3 + 4 + 5) * R^2 * sin(A) * sin(B) * sin(C) / (2R) * (2R) * (2R)\n\nSince the sum of the lengths of the three arcs is the circumference of the circle, the lengths of the three arcs represent the central angles in radians.\n\nTherefore, A = 3/R, B = 4/R, and C = 5/R.\n\nWe can substitute these values into the formula to get:\nArea = (1/2) * (3 + 4 + 5) * R^2 * sin(3/R) * sin(4/R) * sin(5/R)\n\nWe can simplify this expression by using the identity sin(x) * sin(2x) = (1/2) * sin(3x)\n\nUsing this identity, we can rewrite the area as:\nArea = (1/2) * (3 + 4 + 5) * R^2 * sin(3/R) * sin(2 * 4/R) * sin(2 * 5/R)\n= (1/2) * (3 + 4 + 5) * R^2 * sin(3/R) * sin(8/R) * sin(10/R)\n\nNow we can use the identity sin(x) * sin(2x) = (1/2) * sin(3x) again to simplify the expression further.\n\nHowever, this approach becomes complicated.\n\nWe can simplify our approach by using the relationship between the central angle and the arc lengths. \n\nThe area of the triangle is also given by the formula:\nArea = r * (r + R) * sin(A) * sin(B) * sin(C)\n\nwhere r is the inradius of the triangle.\n\nLet's denote the semiperimeter of the triangle as s, then the inradius r is given by:\nr = (s^2 - (3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2)/4) / (3 + 4 + 5)\n\nwhere the semiperimeter s is given by:\ns = (3 + 4 + 5)/2\n\nTo calculate the inradius r, we can use the formula:\nArea = r * (s^2 - (3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2)/4)\n\nWe can calculate the semiperimeter s as:\ns = (3 + 4 + 5)/2\n= 6\n\nThe area of the triangle is then given by:\nArea = r * (s^2 - (3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2)/4)\n\nTo calculate the inradius r, we can use the formula:\nr = (s^2 - (3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2)/4) / (3 + 4 + 5)\n\n= (6^2 - (3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2)/4) / 6\n= (36 - (9 + 16 + 25)/4) / 6\n= (36 -
