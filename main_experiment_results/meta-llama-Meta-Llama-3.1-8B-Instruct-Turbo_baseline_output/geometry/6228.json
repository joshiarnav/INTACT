    "model_solution": "Given $\\triangle ABC$ with $AC:CB = 3:4$, we can find the ratio of the sides using the Angle Bisector Theorem. But here we need to find the ratio of $PA:AB$.\n\nFirst, we need to find the ratio of $AC:CB$. This is given as $3:4$. \n\nLet's use the Angle Bisector Theorem on the triangle. The theorem states that if an angle bisector intersects the opposite side of a triangle, it divides that side proportionally to the other two sides. \n\nHowever, here the angle bisector is for the exterior angle at $C$. So we need to use the exterior angle theorem which states that the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles. \n\nLet's denote $AC$ as $3x$ and $CB$ as $4x$, where $x$ is a positive real number.\n\nLet's draw the triangle and the bisector and denote $EB$ as $y$. Now $PB$ is $y + AB$, and $PA$ is $x + AB$ or $PA = x + y + AB$. The ratio $PA:AB$ is given by:\n\n$\\frac{PA}{AB} = \\frac{x + y + AB}{AB}$.\n\nWe can see that the exterior angle bisector theorem can be applied here, because the angle bisector of the exterior angle intersects the line segment $AB$ extended at $P$.\n\nThis theorem involves the ratio of the segments of the side $AC$ and $CB$ intersected by the interior angle bisector, and the ratio of the segments of the side $BA$ extended intersected by the exterior angle bisector. \n\nThis theorem states that the ratio of the segments of the side $BA$ extended is equal to the ratio of the segments of the side $AC$ intersected by the interior angle bisector and the segments of the side $CB$ intersected by the interior angle bisector. \n\nIn our case, the exterior angle bisector theorem gives the ratio of $EA:y = 3:4$. However the ratio we are looking for is the ratio of $PA:AB$. In order to find this ratio, we can first find the ratio $EB:AB$.\n\nSince the triangle $EAB$ is similar to the triangle $CBA$, the ratio of $EA:y$ is equal to $3:4$. So the ratio $EB:AB$ is $\\frac{3+4}{3} = \\frac{7}{3}$. \n\nNow we can use the ratio $EB:AB$ to find the ratio $PA:AB$. \n\n$\\frac{EB}{AB} = \\frac{7}{3}$.\n\nLet the ratio $PA:AB$ be $\\frac{PA}{AB} = \\frac{x+y+AB}{AB} = \\frac{x+y}{AB} + 1$. \n\nNow using the ratio of $EB:AB$ we can find the value of $y+AB$. \n\n$\\frac{y+AB}{AB} = \\frac{7}{3}$.\n\n$\\frac{y+AB}{AB} = \\frac{PA}{AB} - 1 = \\frac{x+y}{AB}$. \n\nSo $\\frac{y+AB}{AB} = \\frac{x+y}{AB} = \\frac{7}{3}$.\n\nSo $3y = 7x$ and $3AB = 7y$.\n\nNow we can calculate the value of $\\frac{PA}{AB} = \\frac{x+y+AB}{AB} = \\frac{x+y+ \\frac{3AB}{7}}{AB} = \\frac{7x+7y+3AB}{7AB}$.\n\nUsing the values of $3AB = 7y$ and $3y = 7x$ we get, \n\n$\\frac{PA}{AB} = \\frac{7x+3AB+7y}{7AB} = \\frac{7x+7y+3AB}{7AB} = \\frac{7x+7x+3AB}{7AB}$.\n\n$= \\frac{14x+3AB}{7AB}$.\n\nNow using the value of $3AB = 7y$ we can replace it with $7x$ (as $3y = 7x$).\n\n$= \\frac{14x+7x}{7AB}$.\n\n$= \\frac{21x}{7AB}$.\n\n$= \\frac{3x}{AB}$.\n\nThe value of $\\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{AB}{3x}$ and the value of $\\frac{CB}{AB} = \\frac{4x}{AB}$.\n\nSo the value of $\\frac{AB}{AC} + \\frac{CB}{AB} = \\frac{AB}{3x} + \\frac{4x}{AB} = \\frac{AB^2+12x^2}{3x \\cdot AB}$.\n\n$\\triangle ABC$ is a triangle, so it is always greater than zero.\n\nSo, $AB^2+12x^2 > 0$.\n\nAlso, $3x \\cdot AB > 0$.\n\nSo, $\\frac{AB^2+12x^2}{3x \\cdot AB} > 0$.\n\nThis implies that $\\frac{AB}{3x} + \\frac{4x}{AB} > 0$.\n\nSo the value of $\\frac{AB}{3x} + \\frac{4x}{AB} = \\frac{AB^2 + 12x^2}{3x \\cdot AB}$ is a positive real number.\n\nAs the value of $\\frac{AB}{3x} + \\frac{4x}{AB} = \\frac{AB^2 + 12x^2}{3x \\cdot AB}$ is a positive real number and always greater than zero, we can say that the value of $\\frac{AB^2+12x^2}{3x \\cdot AB}$ is positive.\n\nNow we can see that the denominator of the expression is always positive and the numerator is a positive real number.\n\nTherefore, the expression $\\frac{PA}{AB} = \\frac{3x}{AB}$ is positive.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3:1}$."
