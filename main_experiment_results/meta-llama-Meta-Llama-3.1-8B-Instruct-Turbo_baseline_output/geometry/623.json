    "solution": "Let the coordinates of $A$ be $(a_1,a_2)$. Then since $A$ is on the graph of $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, we know that $a_2 = -\\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$. We can also use our knowledge of special right triangles to write $a_2$ in terms of $a_1$. Let $C$ be the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ and let $O$ be the origin. Then $OCA$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, so the ratio of the length of $OC$ to the length of $CA$ is $\\sqrt{3}:1$. Now the coordinates of C are $(0, a_2)$, so the length of $OC$ is just $-a_2$ (since $a_2$ is negative) and the length of $CA$ is $a_1$. This means $\\dfrac{-a_2}{a_1}=\\sqrt{3} \\Longrightarrow a_2=-\\sqrt{3}a_1$.\n\nWe can now set our two equations for $a_2$ equal to each other and get $-\\sqrt{3}a_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$. Multiplying both sides by $-\\frac{2}{a_1}$ immediately gives $a_1=2\\sqrt{3}$. From here we could solve for $a_2$ using one of our equations and then use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the side length of the equilateral triangle, but there's a better way. We remember that the hypotenuse of our special triangle is twice as long as the shortest side of it, which has length $a_1=2\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore our answer is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let the coordinates of $A$ be $(a, -\\frac{a^2}{2})$ and the coordinates of $B$ be $(-a, -\\frac{a^2}{2})$. \n\nNow, the midpoint of $AB$ is $O$, so its coordinates are $(0, 0)$. Therefore, the midpoint of $AB$ can be expressed as $\\left( \\frac{(a) + (-a)}{2}, \\frac{-\\frac{a^2}{2} -\\frac{a^2}{2}}{2}\\right)$ which simplifies to $\\left(0, -\\frac{a^2}{4}\\right)$. As we know that $(0, 0)$ is the midpoint, we can set $-\\frac{a^2}{4} = 0$ to get $a^2 = 0$. But this means that the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are both at the origin. This would imply that the triangle is degenerate. \n\nHowever, this is not possible as the problem statement says that $ABO$ is an equilateral triangle. \n\nHence, the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ can't be the origin. To find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$, we need to use the properties of an equilateral triangle. Since $O$ is the origin, and $A$ and $B$ are at the same y-coordinate, we can assume the y-coordinate of $A$ and $B$ to be $-r^2/2$, where $r$ is the distance from the origin to the vertices $A$ and $B$.\n\nThe horizontal distance from the origin to the vertices $A$ and $B$ is $r$. We also know that the angle between the line $OA$ and the positive x-axis is $\\theta$. Then the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ will be $(r\\cos\\theta, -r^2/2)$ and $(-r\\cos\\theta, -r^2/2)$ respectively.\n\nSince the triangle is equilateral, the angle $\\theta$ is equal to $\\pm \\frac{\\pi}{3}$.\n\nIf $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$, the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ will be $(r\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{3}, -r^2/2)$ and $(-r\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{3}, -r^2/2)$ respectively. As $\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{1}{2}$, we get $(\\frac{r}{2}, -r^2/2)$ and $(-\\frac{r}{2}, -r^2/2)$.\n\nIf $\\theta = -\\frac{\\pi}{3}$, the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ will be $(r\\cos(-\\frac{\\pi}{3}), -r^2/2)$ and $(-r\\cos(-\\frac{\\pi}{3}), -r^2/2)$ respectively. As $\\cos(-\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\frac{1}{2}$, we get $(\\frac{r}{2}, -r^2/2)$ and $(-\\frac{r}{2}, -r^2/2)$.\n\nSince $\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\cos(-\\frac{\\pi}{3})$, we get the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ to be $(\\frac{r}{2}, -r^2/2)$ and $(-\\frac{r}{2}, -r^2/2)$.\n\nAs the y-coordinate of $A$ and $B$ is $-r^2/2$, we get $-r^2/2 = -\\frac{1}{2}a^2$ which simplifies to $r^2 = a^2$.\n\nSince the distance from the origin to $A$ is $r$, the equation of the locus of $A$ is $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{r^2} = r^2$. As we are given that $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, we can substitute $-\\frac{1}{2}x^2$ for $y$ in the equation of the locus of $A$. This gives $x^2 + \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}x^2}{r^2} = r^2$. This simplifies to $x^2(1-\\frac{1}{2r^2}) = r^2$.\n\nWe can also write the equation of the locus of $A$ as $x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4 = r^2$.\n\nEquating both the equations of the locus of $A$ gives $x^2(1-\\frac{1}{2r^2}) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4$.\n\nHowever, this is a fourth degree equation in $x$. But we are given that the y-coordinate of $A$ and $B$ is the same, and we have used this information to find the equation of the locus of $A$. \n\nHowever, we can find a simpler equation by using the properties of the triangle. Since $A$ and $B$ are the vertices of an equilateral triangle, we can find the length of $AB$ using the distance formula: \n\n$AB = \\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$. \n\nAs $A$ and $B$ are $(-\\frac{r}{2}, -r^2/2)$ and $(\\frac{r}{2}, -r^2/2)$ respectively, we get:\n\n$AB = \\sqrt{(-\\frac{r}{2} - \\frac{r}{2})^2 + (-r^2/2 + r^2/2)^2}$\n\nThis simplifies to $AB = \\sqrt{r^2}$.\n\nWe also know that the distance from the origin to $A$ is $r$, so the equation of the locus of $A$ is $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{r^2} = r^2$. As we are given that $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, we can substitute $-\\frac{1}{2}x^2$ for $y$ in the equation of the locus of $A$. This gives $x^2 + \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2}x^2}{r^2} = r^2$. This simplifies to $x^2(1-\\frac{1}{2r^2}) = r^2$.\n\nHowever, we can simplify this equation further by using the properties of the triangle. As we know that the length of $AB$ is $r$, we can write the equation of the locus of $A$ as $x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4 = r^2$.\n\nEquating the two equations of the locus of $A$ gives $x^2(1-\\frac{1}{2r^2}) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4$.\n\nHowever, this is a fourth degree equation in $x$. \n\nWe can simplify this equation further by using the properties of the triangle. As we know that the length of $AB$ is $r$, we can write the equation of the locus of $A$ as $x^2(1-\\frac{1}{2r^2}) = r^2$.\n\nMultiplying both sides by $2r^2$ gives $2r^2x^2(1-\\frac{1}{2r^2}) = 2r^4$.\n\nThis simplifies to $2r^2x^2 - r^2 = 2r^4$.\n\nHowever, this equation is still in terms of $r$ and $x$. But we can simplify this equation further by using the properties of the triangle. As we know that the length of $AB$ is $r$, we can find the equation of the locus of $A$ in terms of $r$ and $y$. \n\nWe are given that $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, so substituting this in the equation of the locus of $A$ gives $x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4 = r^2$.\n\nHowever, we can simplify this equation further by using the properties of the triangle.

We are given that $OA = OB = \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{3}}$, where $r$ is the distance from"
