    "problem": "Two points $A(x_1, y_1)$ and $B(x_2, y_2)$ are chosen on the graph of $f(x) = \\ln x$, with $0 < x_1 < x_2$. The points $C$ and $D$ trisect $\\overline{AB}$, with $AC < CB$. Through $C$ a horizontal line is drawn to cut the curve at $E(x_3, y_3)$. Find $x_3$ if $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 1000$.\n",
    "solution": "Since $C$ is the trisector of line segment $\\overline{AB}$ closer to $A$, the $y$-coordinate of $C$ is equal to two thirds the $y$-coordinate of $A$ plus one third the $y$-coordinate of $B$. Thus, point $C$ has coordinates $(x_0, \\frac{2}{3} \\ln 1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\ln 1000) = (x_0, \\ln 10)$ for some $x_0$. Then the horizontal line through $C$ has equation $y = \\ln 10$, and this intersects the curve $y = \\ln x$ at the point $(10, \\ln 10)$, so $x_3 = \\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the coordinates of point $C$. Since $C$ trisects $AB$ and $AC < CB$, $C$ is one-third of the way from $A$ to $B$. \n\nLet $A(x_1, y_1)$ and $B(x_2, y_2)$. Then, \n\\[y_1 = \\ln x_1\\]\n\\[y_2 = \\ln x_2\\]\n\nWe need to find the coordinates of point $C$, which will be at $(x_c, y_c)$. We know that point $C$ is one-third of the way from point $A$ to point $B$. \n\nWe can find the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of point $C$ as:\n\n\\[x_c = x_1 + \\frac{x_2 - x_1}{3}\\]\n\\[y_c = y_1 + \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{3}\\]\n\nSince $y_1 = \\ln x_1$ and $y_2 = \\ln x_2$, we can substitute $y_1$ and $y_2$ into the equation for $y_c$ to get:\n\n\\[y_c = \\ln x_1 + \\frac{\\ln x_2 - \\ln x_1}{3}\\]\n\\[y_c = \\ln x_1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\ln \\frac{x_2}{x_1}\\]\n\nNow, given that $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 1000$, we can substitute these values into the equation for $y_c$ to get:\n\n\\[y_c = \\ln 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\ln \\frac{1000}{1}\\]\n\\[y_c = 0 + \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 1000\\]\n\\[y_c = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 1000\\]\n\nNow, since the line through $C$ is horizontal, it will have the same $y$ coordinate as $C$. This $y$ coordinate will also be the $y$ coordinate of point $E(x_3, y_3)$. \n\nSo, we can write:\n\n\\[y_3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 1000\\]\n\nSince $y_3 = \\ln x_3$, we can equate this to $\\ln x_3$ and solve for $x_3$:\n\n\\[\\ln x_3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln 1000\\]\n\\[x_3 = e^{\\frac{1}{3} \\ln 1000}\\]\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that $e^{\\ln x} = x$, we can simplify this to:\n\n\\[x_3 = (1000)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\]\n\n\\[x_3 = 10\\]\n\nThe value of $x_3$ is 10."
