    "problem": "Amy and Belinda each roll a sheet of 6-inch by 8-inch paper to form a cylindrical tube. Amy tapes the two 8-inch sides together without overlap. Belinda tapes the two 6-inch sides together without overlap. What is $\\pi$ times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes?",
    "solution": "Amy's cylinder has a height of 8 and a base circumference of 6.  Let her cylinder have volume $V_A$ and radius $r_A$; we have $2\\pi r_A = 6$ so $r_A = 3/\\pi$ and $V_A = \\pi r_A ^2 h = \\pi (3/\\pi)^2 (8) = 72/\\pi$.\n\nBelinda's cylinder has a height of 6 and a base circumference of 8.  Similarly, let her cylinder have volume $V_B$ and radius $r_B$; we have $2\\pi r_B = 8$ so $r_B = 4/\\pi$ and $V_B = \\pi r_B^2 h = \\pi (4/\\pi)^2 (6) = 96/\\pi$.\n\nThe positive difference between the volume of the two tubes is $96/\\pi - 72/\\pi = 24/\\pi$ cubic inches; $\\pi$ times this difference is $\\boxed{24}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volumes of the tubes, we first need to find the radius of the tubes.\n\nWhen Amy tapes the 8-inch sides together, the height of the cylinder becomes 8 inches, and the circumference of the base becomes 6 inches. We know that the circumference of a circle is given by $2\\pi r$. So, we can set up the equation $2\\pi r = 6$ and solve for $r$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2\\pi r &= 6\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad r &= \\frac{6}{2\\pi} = \\frac{3}{\\pi}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWhen Belinda tapes the 6-inch sides together, the height of the cylinder becomes 6 inches, and the circumference of the base becomes 8 inches. We can set up the equation $2\\pi r = 8$ and solve for $r$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2\\pi r &= 8\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad r &= \\frac{8}{2\\pi} = \\frac{4}{\\pi}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow we can find the volumes of the tubes. The volume of a cylinder is given by $\\pi r^2 h$. For Amy's tube, we have $r = \\frac{3}{\\pi}$ and $h = 8$, so the volume is $\\pi\\left(\\frac{3}{\\pi}\\right)^2(8) = \\frac{81}{\\pi}$ cubic inches. For Belinda's tube, we have $r = \\frac{4}{\\pi}$ and $h = 6$, so the volume is $\\pi\\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^2(6) = \\frac{81}{\\pi}$ cubic inches.\n\nThe positive difference of the volumes is $\\frac{81}{\\pi} - \\frac{96}{\\pi} = -\\frac{15}{\\pi}$. Multiplying this by $\\pi$ gives us $-15$."
