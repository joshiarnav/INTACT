    "problem": "How many different triangles can be formed having a perimeter of 7 units if each side must have integral length?",
    "solution": "Let $a,b,$ and $c$ represent the three side lengths of the triangle. The perimeter is $a+b+c=7,$ so $b+c=7-a$. We know by the Triangle Inequality that the sum of two side lengths of a triangle must be greater than the third side length. If we focus on the variable $a$, we have\n\\[b+c>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 7-a>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 3.5>a.\\]We could easily replace $a$ with $b$ or $c$, so the maximum length of any of the three sides is $3$. If $a=3$, then $b+c=4$ and $b$ and $c$ could be $1$ and $3$ in some order or $2$ and $2$ in some order. If we let $a=2$ or $a=1$ and the maximum side length is $3$, we'll still end up with triangles of side lengths $(1,3,3)$ or $(2,2,3)$. There are $\\boxed{2}$ different triangles.",

    "model_solution": "To form a triangle with integral side lengths and a perimeter of 7 units, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side (triangle inequality theorem). \n\nWe can consider the following possibilities for the side lengths of the triangle:\n\n1. (1, 1, 5): This is not possible because the sum of the two smaller sides (1+1) is not greater than the third side (5).\n\n2. (1, 2, 4): This is also not possible for the same reason as above.\n\n3. (1, 3, 3): This is a valid possibility because the sum of the two smaller sides (1+3) is greater than the third side (3), and the sum of the two middle sides (3+3) is greater than the smallest side (1). \n\n4. (2, 2, 3): This is a valid possibility because the sum of the two smaller sides (2+2) is greater than the third side (3), and the sum of the two middle sides (2+3) is greater than the smallest side (2).\n\n5. (2, 3, 2): This is the same as the possibility (2, 2, 3), so it is not a distinct possibility.\n\n6. (3, 2, 2): This is also the same as the possibility (2, 2, 3), so it is not a distinct possibility.\n\n7. (3, 3, 1): This is not possible because the sum of the two smaller sides (3+3) is greater than the third side (1), which violates the triangle inequality theorem.\n\n8. (3, 4, 0): This is not possible because the third side must have a positive length.\n\n9. (3, 1, 3): The sides 3, 1, and 3 is the same as the possibility (1, 3, 3), so it is not a distinct possibility.\n\n10. (4, 2, 1): This is not possible because the sum of the two smaller sides (2+1) is not greater than the third side (4).\n\n11. (4, 1, 2): The sides 4, 1, and 2 is the same as the possibility (1, 2, 4), so it is not a distinct possibility.\n\n12. (4, 0, 3): This is not possible because the third side must have a positive length.\n\n13. (5, 1, 1): This is not possible because the sum of the two smaller sides (1+1) is not greater than the third side (5).\n\n14. (5, 0, 2): This is not possible because the second side must have a positive length.\n\n15. (0, 2, 5): This is not possible because the first and the third sides must have positive lengths.\n\n16. (0, 3, 4): This is not possible because the first side must have a positive length.\n\n17. (0, 4, 3): This is not possible because the first side must have a positive length.\n\n18. (0, 5, 2): This is not possible because the first side must have a positive length.\n\n19. (1, 0, 6): This is not possible because the first and the third sides must have positive lengths.\n\n20. (1, 4, 2): The sides 1, 4, and 2 is the same as the possibility (2, 1, 4) which is the same as the possibility (4, 1, 2), so it is not a distinct possibility.\n\n21. (1, 5, 1): This is not possible because the sum of the two smaller sides (1+1) is not greater than the third side (5).\n\n22. (2, 0, 5): This is not possible because the second side must have a positive length.\n\n23. (2, 1, 4): The sides 2, 1, and 4 is the same as the possibility (4, 1, 2), so it is not a distinct possibility.\n\n24. (2, 4, 1): The sides 2, 4, and 1 is the same as the possibility (1, 2, 4), so it is not a distinct possibility.\n\n25. (4, 0, 3): This is the same as the possibility (0, 3, 4), so it is not a distinct possibility.\n\n26. (4, 5, 0): This is not possible because the third side must have a positive length.\n\n27. (5, 0, 2): This is the same as the possibility (0, 2, 5), so it is not a distinct possibility.\n\n28. (5, 1, 1): This is the same as the possibility (1, 5, 1), so it is not a distinct possibility.\n\n29. (5, 2, 0): This is not possible because the second and the third sides must have positive lengths.\n\n30. (5, 3, 0): This is not possible because the third side must have a positive length.\n\nCombining the possibilities and removing any duplicate cases, we find that the different triangles that can be formed with a perimeter of 7 units and integral side lengths are:\n\n(1, 3, 3) and (2, 2, 3)\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2."
