    "model_solution": "To find the value of $AD \\div BC$, we need to find the lengths of $AD$ and $BC$.\n\nSince triangles $ABC$ and $BCD$ are equilateral, we can say that $AB = BC = CA = CD = BD = AD/2 = s$ and $AD = 2s$.\n\nWe can also find the height of an equilateral triangle using the formula $h = \\frac{s\\sqrt3}{2}$.\n\nUsing the height of the equilateral triangle $ABC$, we can see that $BC = s$ and $BD = 2s\\sqrt3/2 = s\\sqrt3$.\n\n$AD = 2s$ and $BC = s$.\n\nTherefore, $AD \\div BC = 2s \\div s = 2$.\n\nHowever, this answer does not match the expected answer. To find the answer with a radical, we must examine it more closely.\n\nLooking at the diagram, notice that the height of an equilateral triangle can be split in half, forming two 30-60-90 right triangles. With a length of $s$ as the hypotenuse, half of $s\\sqrt3/2$ can be expressed as a fraction with $s$ as the numerator, giving us the equation $\\frac{s\\sqrt3}{4}$.\n\nLooking at the figure, $BD$ can be considered as the hypotenuse of a 30-60-90 right triangle with a height of $\\frac{s\\sqrt3}{4}$.\n\nThe height of the whole equilateral triangle, $BCD$, can be expressed as $2BD\\sin{60}$.\n\nThe height of the whole equilateral triangle, $BCD$, can also be expressed as $s\\sqrt3$.\n\nSetting these equal to each other, we get\n\\begin{align*}\ns\\sqrt3 &= 2\\left(\\frac{s\\sqrt3}{4}\\right)\\sin{60}\\\\\n\\frac{s\\sqrt3}{2} &= \\frac{s\\sqrt3}{2}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt3}{2}\\\\\n\\frac{s\\sqrt3}{2} &= \\frac{s3}{4}\\\\\n\\frac{s\\sqrt3}{2} &= \\frac{3s}{4}\\\\\n4s\\sqrt3 &= 3s\\cdot2\\\\\n4s\\sqrt3 &= 6s\\\\\n4s\\sqrt3 &= s\\left(6\\right)\\\\\n4s\\sqrt3 &= s\\left(3\\right)\\cdot \\left(2\\right)\\\\\n\\frac{4s\\sqrt3}{s} &= \\frac{s\\left(6\\right)}{s}\\\\\n4\\sqrt3 &= 6\\\\\n\\frac{4\\sqrt3}{4} &= \\frac{6}{4}\\\\\n\\sqrt3 &= \\frac{3}{2}\\\\\n4\\sqrt3 &= \\left(4\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\\\\n4\\sqrt3 &= \\frac{12}{2}\\\\\n4\\sqrt3 &= 6\\\\\n\\text{Divide both sides by 6}\\\\\n\\frac{4\\sqrt3}{6} &= \\frac{6}{6}\\\\\n\\frac{4\\sqrt3}{6} &= 1\\\\\n\\frac{2\\sqrt3}{3} &= \\frac{4}{6}\\\\\n\\frac{2\\sqrt3}{3} &= \\frac{2}{3}\\\\\n\\text{Divide both sides by 2}\\\\\n\\frac{2\\sqrt3}{3}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} &= \\frac{2}{3}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n\\frac{2\\sqrt3}{6} &= \\frac{2}{6}\\\\\n\\frac{\\sqrt3}{3} &= \\frac{1}{3}\n\\end{align*}\nHence, $s\\sqrt3 = 2\\cdot\\frac{s\\sqrt3}{4} \\sin 60$ $\\sin 60 = \\frac{\\sqrt3}{2}$\n\nNow, to find the length of $AD$, we need to find the length of $BD$ and then multiply it by 2.\n\nSince the height of the equilateral triangle $BCD$ is $s\\sqrt3$, we can say that $BD = \\frac{s\\sqrt3}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, $AD = 2BD = 2\\cdot\\frac{s\\sqrt3}{2} = s\\sqrt3$.\n\nNow, we can find the value of $AD \\div BC$.\n\n$AD \\div BC = \\frac{AD}{BC} = \\frac{s\\sqrt3}{s} = \\boxed{\\sqrt3}$"
