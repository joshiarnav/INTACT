    "problem": "A square sheet of paper has area $6 \\text{ cm}^2$. The front is white and the back is black. When the sheet is folded so that point $A$ rests on the diagonal as shown, the visible black area is equal to the visible white area. How many centimeters is $A$ from its original position? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the length of a leg of the black isosceles triangle.  Then the black area is $\\frac{1}{2}(x)(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x^2$.  The white area is $6-x^2$.  Solving $\\frac{1}{2}x^2=6-x^2$, we find $x^2=4$, so $x=2$.  The distance from A to its original position is the length of a hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs have length $x$.  Therefore, A is $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$ centimeters from its original position.",

    "model_solution": "To find the distance from point $A$ to its original position, we start by identifying some key points on the diagram.\n\nLet's label point $B$ as the new position of point $A$ after folding and point $C$ as the point where the fold occurs. We denote the length of a leg of the black isosceles triangle as $x$ and the length of a leg of the white isosceles triangle as $y$.\n\nSince the area of the original square sheet is $6 \\text{ cm}^2$, each leg of the square is $\\sqrt{6} \\text{ cm}$.\n\nConsidering the black triangle, its height is $\\frac{\\sqrt {6}}{2}$ and its base is $\\sqrt{6} - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2}$. Using the formula for the area of a triangle ($A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$), the black triangle's area can be represented as $\\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{6} - \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2})(\\frac{\\sqrt {6}}{2})$.\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{3}{8}\\sqrt{6} \\text{ cm}^2$.\n\nNow, let's consider the area of the white triangle. The base of the white triangle is $\\frac{\\ sqrt{6}}{2}$ and its height is $y$. We can denote the area of the white triangle as $\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{\\sqrt {6}}{2})(y) = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}y}{4} \\text{ cm}^2$.\n\nSince the visible black area is equal to the visible white area, we can set up the equation $\\frac{3}{8}\\sqrt{6} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}y}{4}$.\n\nSolving for $y$, we get $y = \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot 2 = \\frac{3}{4} \\sqrt{6}$.\n\nSince point $A$ is $y$ away from point $C$ and $y = \\frac{3}{4} \\sqrt{6}$, we can find the distance from point $A$ to its original position as $y$ is half the length of the square's leg.\n\nTherefore, $y = \\frac{3}{4} \\sqrt{6}$ is the length of half the square's leg. We multiply this value by $2$ to find that the distance from point $A$ to its original position is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{6}}$ centimeters."
