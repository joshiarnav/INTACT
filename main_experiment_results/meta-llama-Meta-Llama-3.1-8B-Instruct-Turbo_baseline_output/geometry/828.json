    "problem": "Steve has an isosceles triangle with base 8 inches and height 10 inches. He wants to cut it into eight pieces that have equal areas, as shown below. To the nearest hundredth of an inch what is the number of inches in the greatest perimeter among the eight pieces?

    "solution": "To make the $8$ triangles have the same area, the base must be divided into $8$ segments of length $1$ inch each.  Define points $A$, $B_0$, $B_1$, $B_2$, $B_3$, and $B_4$ as in the figure.  For $0\\leq k\\leq 3$, the perimeter $P(k)$ of triangle $A B_k B_{k+1}$ in inches is \\[\nP(k)=1+\\sqrt{10^2+k^2}+\\sqrt{10^2+(k+1)^2},\n\\]where each distance $A B_k$ is calculated by applying the Pythagorean theorem to right triangle $A B_0 B_k$.  Since $P(k)$ increases as $k$ increases, its largest value is $P(3)=1+\\sqrt{100+3^2}+\\sqrt{100+4^2}$, which to the nearest hundredth is $\\boxed{22.21}$ inches.

    "model_solution": "To find the greatest perimeter among the eight pieces, we first need to calculate the area of each piece. The total area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot8\\cdot10=40$ square inches.\n\nThe eight pieces can be divided into two categories, the smaller and the larger pieces, depending on the position of the cuts. There are 4 smaller pieces and 4 larger pieces.\n\nEach of the larger pieces has an area of $\\frac{40}{8} = 5$ square inches. The smaller pieces have a combined area of $40-4 \\cdot 5 = 10$ square inches.\n\nLet $x$ be the length of each of the two cuts on the left side of the triangle. Then the area of each of the smaller pieces on the left is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot x \\cdot 10 = 5$ square inches. Thus $x = \\frac{5}{5} = 1$. \n\nSimilarly, the length of each of the two cuts on the right side of the triangle is $8 - x = 8 - 1 = 7$ inches, and the area of each of the smaller pieces on the right is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(3 \\sqrt{5}\\right) \\cdot 10 = 5 \\sqrt{5}$ square inches.\n\nWe need to calculate the perimeter of each of the larger pieces. Let's consider a piece on the left side, for example. Its sides are $\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\sqrt{5}$, and its perimeter is $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{5} = 1 + \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{5}$ inches.\n\nLet's consider a piece on the right side. Its sides are $4,4,5$, and its perimeter is $2 \\cdot 4 + 5 = 13$ inches.\n\nNow we need to compare the perimeters of the two types of pieces. We can calculate the perimeter of the largest piece on the left side:\n\n$P = 1 + \\frac{3 \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\approx 1 + 2.12 \\approx 3.12$.\n\nOn the other hand, the perimeter of the largest piece on the right side is $13$ inches.\n\nTherefore, the greatest perimeter among the eight pieces is $13$ inches."
