    "model_solution": "To find the greatest and least possible integral values of $x$, we need to consider the constraints of the triangle. The triangle inequality states that for any triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.\n\nIn this case, we have a triangle with side lengths $5$, $6$, and $x$. Applying the triangle inequality, we get:\n\n- $x + 5 > 6$\n- $x + 6 > 5$\n- $5 + 6 > x$\n\nSimplifying these inequalities, we get:\n\n- $x > 1$\n- $x > -1$\n- $x < 11$\n\nSince $x$ must be a positive value (as it is a side length), we can ignore the inequality $x > -1$. The other two inequalities give us the following constraints:\n\n- $x > 1$\n- $x < 11$\n\nTherefore, the least possible integral value of $x$ is $2$, and the greatest possible integral value of $x$ is $10$.\n\nThe positive difference between these two values is:\n\n$10 - 2 = 8$"
