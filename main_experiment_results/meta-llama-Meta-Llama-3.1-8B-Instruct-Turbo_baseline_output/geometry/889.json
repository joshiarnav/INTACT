    "solution": "Because the figure has rotational symmetry, $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$. Consequently, the triangles $BZQ$ and $BWQ$ have the same area because they share a height and have bases that are the same length. We have\n\n$$[BQW]=\\dfrac{1}{2}[BZW]=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\left([ABWZ]-[ABZ]\\right)$$$$=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\left(120-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\cdot6\\cdot12\\right)=\\dfrac{1}{2}(120-36)=\\dfrac{84}{2}=\\boxed{42}.$$",

    "model_solution": "Given that $ABCD$ is a rectangle, we have $AB=12$, $AD=20$ (from $ABCD$ being a rectangle) and $AZ=WC=6$.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the rectangle $ABCD$. The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. This is $AB \\times AD = 12 \\times 20 = 240$ square units.\n\nWe are given that the area of the trapezoid $ZWCD$ is 120 square units, and since the trapezoid is part of the rectangle, we can find the area of the part of the rectangle not included in the trapezoid by subtracting the area of the trapezoid from the area of the rectangle, which is $240 - 120 = 120$ square units.\n\nThe remaining area of the rectangle, 120 square units, is shared by the triangles $BQW$ and $ZWD$. Notice that $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$ as $ABCD$ is a rectangle. Therefore, $ZW$ is equal to twice the length of $ZQ$ or $WQ$. \n\nWe have the equation $AZ^2 + ZQ^2 = AQ^2$ and $WC^2 + WQ^2 = WQ^2$. This is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nWe have the areas of the trapezoid, $BZWD$ (120) and $BQW$ that we are trying to find. The area of the trapezoid is equal to $BZWD - BQW$. Therefore, we have the equation $120 = BZWD - BQW$."
