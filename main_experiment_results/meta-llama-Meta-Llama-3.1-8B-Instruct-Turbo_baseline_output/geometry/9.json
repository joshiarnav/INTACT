    "problem": "A round pizza is $\\frac13$ of an inch thick and has a diameter of 12 inches. It is cut into 12 congruent pieces. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one piece? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "The entire pizza has radius 6 inches and volume $\\pi (6^2)(1/3) = 12\\pi$ cubic inches.  One slice has 1/12th this volume, or $\\boxed{\\pi}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of the pizza, we first need to calculate the radius of the pizza, which is half of its diameter. \n\nThe radius is $12 \\div 2 = 6$ inches. \n\nThe formula for the volume of a cylinder is $\\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height (or thickness in this case).\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume of the pizza = $\\pi \\cdot 6^2 \\cdot \\frac13$\n                   = $\\pi \\cdot 36 \\cdot \\frac13$\n                   = $\\pi \\cdot 12$\n                   = $12 \\pi$ cubic inches.\n\nSince the pizza is cut into 12 congruent pieces, each piece has a volume of $\\frac{12\\pi}{12 \\div 1}$ cubic inches.\n \nThe number of cubic inches in the volume of one piece is $\\pi$."
