    "problem": "The corner of a unit cube is chopped off such that the cut runs through the three vertices adjacent to the vertex of the chosen corner.  What is the height of the remaining cube when the freshly-cut face is placed on a table?",
    "solution": "The major diagonal has a length of $\\sqrt{3}$.  The volume of the pyramid is $1/6$, and so its height $h$ satisfies $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot h\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(\\sqrt{2})^2=1/6$ since  the freshly cut face is an equilateral triangle of side length $\\sqrt{2}$.  Thus $h=\\sqrt{3}/3$, and the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to visualize the process. The corner of the cube is chopped off such that the cut runs through the three vertices adjacent to the chosen corner. This essentially means that the cut creates a tetrahedron that is removed from the cube.\n\nLet's consider the cube to have side length 's'. The cut will pass through the three vertices adjacent to the chosen corner, which are (0,0,0), (s,0,0), and (0,s,0). This will create a tetrahedron with vertices at the chosen corner and the three adjacent vertices.\n\nThe volume of the tetrahedron can be calculated using the formula: V = (1/3)Ah, where A is the area of the base, and h is the height of the tetrahedron.\n\nThe area of the base of the tetrahedron is (1/2)s^2 (this is because the three adjacent vertices form an isosceles right triangle).\n\nThe height of the tetrahedron can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Since the cut passes through the three adjacent vertices, the height of the tetrahedron will be sqrt(s^2 + s^2) = sqrt(2)s.\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume of the tetrahedron: V = (1/3)(1/2)s^2(sqrt(2)s) = (1/6)s^3sqrt(2).\n\nSince the volume of the tetrahedron is (1/6)s^3sqrt(2), the volume of the remaining cube is (1 - (1/6)s^3sqrt(2))s^3 (the volume of the cube minus the volume of the tetrahedron).\n\nHowever, to find the height of the remaining cube, we need to understand that the height will be the distance from the table to the opposite face of the cube.\n\nThe height of the remaining cube can be calculated as: \n\nLet's consider the base of the cut (removal) to be a square, and for that square, the distance from its center to the edge of the cube will be (s^2 - (1/2)s^2)/s, when viewed along the edge of the cube. Then we would then need to do Pythagoras to get the height from the edge of the cube to the edge of the removed part, which is (s^2 - (1/2)s^2)/s*sqrt(2), but this is not the height of the cube, as this is the height of the remaining part of the cube when viewed along the edge of the cube.\n\nHowever, the correct way to do this is to do Pythagoras for the height of the cube, where the distance from the removed part to the opposite edge of the cube would be ((1/2)s^2)/s*sqrt(2), the correct height is therefore s - ((1/2)s^2)/s*sqrt(2), where this is height when viewed from the edge of the cube.\n\nHowever, the given solution is simpler: \n\nThe correct answer is s - s/3. This is because the height of the remaining cube can also be found by finding the height of the removed tetrahedron, and then subtracting this height from the side length of the cube.\n\nThe height of the removed tetrahedron is s/3 (this is because the tetrahedron has a height of s/3 when viewed along the edge of the cube, as the area of the base of the tetrahedron is (1/2)s^2).\n\nTherefore, the height of the remaining cube is s - s/3 = 2s/3.\n\nHowever, the tetrahedron's height when viewed from the edge of the cube would be more complex to derive, but the solution above does this with ease."
