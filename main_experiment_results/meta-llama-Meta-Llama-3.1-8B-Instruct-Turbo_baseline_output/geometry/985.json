    "solution": "At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{2}{3}(360^\\circ)=240$ degrees.  Every minute, the minute hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}(360^\\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12} (360^\\circ)=0.5$ degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.  After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\\circ-5.5^\\circ\\cdot 15=\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees.",

    "model_solution": "At 8:15, the hour hand is at 8 and the minute hand is at 3. \n\nTo find the number of degrees in the smaller angle formed, we need to find the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand.\n\nThe hour hand moves 30 degrees per hour because there are 12 hours and 360 degrees on the clock. Since the hour hand is at 8, it is 8 * 30 = 240 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nThe minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute because there are 60 minutes and 360 degrees on the clock. At 15 minutes, the minute hand is 15 * 6 = 90 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nThe angle between the hour hand and the minute hand is 240 - 90 = 150 degrees.\n\nHowever, this is not the smaller angle. Since the hour hand is to the right of the 12 o'clock position and the minute hand is to the left, the smaller angle is 360 - 150 = 210 degrees.\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth, the smaller angle is 210.0 degrees."
