    "model_solution": "To find the quotient, we will use polynomial long division. \n\nFirst, divide the leading term of the dividend ($8x^3$) by the leading term of the divisor ($2x$), which gives us $4x^2$. \n\nNow multiply the entire divisor ($2x+5$) by this quotient ($4x^2$), which gives us $8x^3 + 20x^2$. \n\nSubtract this from the dividend ($8x^3+16x^2-7x+4$), which gives us $-4x^2 - 7x + 4$.\n\nNow, divide the leading term of the result ($-4x^2$) by the leading term of the divisor ($2x$), which gives us $-2x$. \n\nNow multiply the entire divisor ($2x+5$) by this quotient ($-2x$), which gives us $-4x^2 - 10x$. \n\nSubtract this from the previous result ($-4x^2 - 7x + 4$), which gives us $3x + 4$.\n\nNow, divide the leading term of the result ($3x$) by the leading term of the divisor ($2x$), which gives us $\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nNow multiply the entire divisor ($2x+5$) by this quotient ($\\frac{3}{2}$), which gives us $3x + \\frac{15}{2}$.\n\nSubtract this from the previous result ($3x + 4$), which gives us $-\\frac{7}{2}$.\n\nNow that we have no more terms to divide, the quotient is $4x^2 - 2x + \\frac{3}{2}$. \n\nThe remainder is $-\\frac{7}{2}$."
