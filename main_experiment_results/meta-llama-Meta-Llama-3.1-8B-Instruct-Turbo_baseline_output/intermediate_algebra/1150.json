    "solution": "If a polynomial has real coefficients, then any complex conjugate of a root must also be a root.  Hence, the other root is $-2 + i \\sqrt{5}.$  Thus, the polynomial is\n\\[(x + 2 + i \\sqrt{5})(x + 2 - i \\sqrt{5}) = (x + 2)^2 - 5i^2 = \\boxed{x^2 + 4x + 9}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "Since the polynomial has real coefficients and has a complex root, its conjugate must also be a root. The conjugate of $-2 - i \\sqrt{5}$ is $-2 + i \\sqrt{5}$.\n\nA monic quadratic polynomial with roots $r$ and $s$ can be written as $(x - r)(x - s)$.  Plugging in the roots $-2 - i \\sqrt{5}$ and $-2 + i \\sqrt{5}$, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(x - (-2 - i \\sqrt{5}))(x - (-2 + i \\sqrt{5})) &= (x + 2 + i \\sqrt{5})(x + 2 - i \\sqrt{5})\\\\\n&= (x + 2)^2 - (i \\sqrt{5})^2\\\\\n&= (x + 2)^2 - (i^2)(\\sqrt{5})^2\\\\\n&= (x + 2)^2 + 5\\\\\n&= x^2 + 4x + 4 + 5\\\\\n&= x^2 + 4x + 9\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo the monic quadratic polynomial with real coefficients that has $-2 - i \\sqrt{5}$ as a root is $\\boxed{x^2 + 4x + 9}$."
