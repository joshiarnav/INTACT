    "model_solution": "Let's start by considering the degree of $p(x)$, which we'll denote by $d$.\n\nThe degree of $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2)$ is $d$.\n\nThe degree of $[p(x)]^2 + 12$ is $2d$.\n\nHence, we have $d = 2d$ and so $d = 0$ or $d = 2$.\n\nIf $d = 0$, then $p(x)$ is a constant polynomial. However, we can take $x$ to be any real number and see that $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2)$ is not a constant.\n\nHence, we must have $d = 2$. Let's write $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ for some real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n\nWe then have\n\\begin{align*}\np(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) &= a(x^3)^2 + b(x^3) + c - (a(x^3 - 2)^2 + b(x^3 - 2) + c) \\\\\n&= a(x^3)^2 - a(x^3 - 2)^2 + b(x^3) - b(x^3 - 2)\n\\end{align*}\nand\n\\begin{align*}\n[p(x)]^2 + 12 &= (ax^2 + bx + c)^2 + 12 \\\\\n&= a^2x^4 + 2abx^3 + (2ac + b^2)x^2 + 2bcx + c^2 + 12.\n\\end{align*}\nHence, $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2)$ and $[p(x)]^2 + 12$ have different degrees and so must be equal to zero.\n\nTherefore, $a(x^3)^2 - a(x^3 - 2)^2 + b(x^3) - b(x^3 - 2) = 0$, which means $a(x^3)^2 - a(x^3 - 2)^2 = 0$ and $b(x^3) - b(x^3 - 2) = 0$.\n\nSimplifying the first equation gives us $a(x^6 - (x^3 - 2)^2) = 0$.\n\nHence, $a(x^6 - x^6 + 4x^3 - 4) = 0$, which means $a(4x^3 - 4) = 0$.\n\nSince $a(4x^3 - 4) = 0$, we must have $a = 0$ or $x^3 - 1 = 0$.\n\nHowever, $x^3 - 1 = 0$ has only one real solution and we can take $x$ to be any real number.\n\nHence, we must have $a = 0$.\n\nSince $a = 0$, we must have $b = 0$.\n\nWe can then take $c$ to be any real number. So, let's say $c = 2$.\n\nThen, $p(x) = 2x^2 + 2$, and it's easy to verify that this is the solution we're looking for.\n\nSo, the polynomial $p(x)$ with real coefficients that satisfies $p(x^3) - p(x^3 - 2) = [p(x)]^2 + 12$ for all real numbers $x$ is $p(x) = 2x^2 + 2$."
