    "model_solution": "Since the function $f(x)$ is a polynomial with even exponents, we can deduce that $f(x) = f(-x)$ for all real numbers $x.$ \n\nWe are given that $f(91) = 1.$ Using this, we can write $f(91) = f(-91)$.\n\nNow, we want to find $f(91) + f(-91)$. Since $f(91) = f(-91)$, we can write this as $f(91) + f(-91) = f(91) + f(91) = 2f(91)$.\n\nSubstituting the value of $f(91)$, we get: \n$f(91) + f(-91) = 2f(91) = 2.$"
