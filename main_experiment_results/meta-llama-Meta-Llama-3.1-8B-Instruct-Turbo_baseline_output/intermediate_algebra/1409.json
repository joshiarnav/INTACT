    "solution": "Let $y$ be a number in the range of $f.$ This means that there is a real number $x$ such that \\[y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}.\\]Multiplying both sides by $x^2-x+1$ and rearranging, we get the equation \\[yx^2-(y+1)x+y=0.\\]Since $x^2-x+1 = (x-\\tfrac12)^2 + \\tfrac34 > 0$ for all $x,$ our steps are reversible, so $y$ is in the range of $f$ if and only if this equation has a real solution for $x.$ In turn, this equation has a real solution for $x$ if and only if the discriminant of this quadratic is nonnegative. Therefore, the range of $f$ consists exactly of the values of $y$ which satisfy \\[(y+1)^2 - 4y^2 \\ge 0,\\]or \\[0 \\ge 3y^2 - 2y - 1.\\]This quadratic factors as \\[0 \\ge (3y+1)(y-1),\\]which means that the solutions to the inequality are given by $-\\tfrac13 \\le y \\le 1.$ Therefore, the range of $g$ is the closed interval $\\boxed{[-\\tfrac13, 1]}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the range of the function, we need to determine what values the function can take as the input $x$ varies over all real numbers.\n\nWe start by assuming that $y$ is in the range of the function, so there exists some real number $x$ such that $y=f(x)$. This gives us the equation\n\n\\[y=\\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}.\\]\n\nNow, we can rewrite this equation as a quadratic equation in terms of $x$. To do this, we first multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator to obtain\n\n\\[yx^2-xy+y = x.\\]\n\nNow, we rearrange this equation to get\n\n\\[yx^2-(y+1)x+y=0.\\]\n\nSince this is a quadratic equation in $x$, we know that it has a solution for any value of $x$ as long as the discriminant is nonnegative. The discriminant is given by the formula\n\n\\[(y+1)^2-4y^2,\\]\n\nso we require that\n\n\\[(y+1)^2-4y^2 \\ge 0.\\]\n\nExpanding the left side of this inequality, we get\n\n\\[y^2+2y+1-4y^2 \\ge 0,\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[-3y^2+2y+1 \\ge 0.\\]\n\nTo solve this inequality, we can factor the left side to obtain\n\n\\[-3\\left(y^2-\\frac{2}{3}y-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\ge 0,\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[-3\\left(y-\\frac{2+\\sqrt{4+12}}{6}\\right)\\left(y-\\frac{2-\\sqrt{4+12}}{6}\\right) \\ge 0.\\]\n\nThe two roots of the quadratic are $y=1$ and $y=\\frac{1}{3}$, so we can rewrite the inequality as\n\n\\[-3(y-1)(y-\\frac{1}{3}) \\ge 0.\\]\n\nThe sign of the left side of this inequality will be positive when $y<\\frac{1}{3}$ or $y>1$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the range of the function is the set of all real numbers $y$ that satisfy $y<\\frac{1}{3}$ or $y>1$. This can be written in interval notation as\n\n\\[(-\\infty,\\frac{1}{3})\\cup(1,\\infty).\\]"
