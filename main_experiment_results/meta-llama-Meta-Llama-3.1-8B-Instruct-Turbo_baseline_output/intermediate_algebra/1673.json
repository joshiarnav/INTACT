    "problem": "If $a$ is a nonzero integer and $b$ is a positive number such that $ab^2=\\log_{10} b$, what is the median of the set $\\{0, 1, a, b,\n1/b\\}$?",
    "solution": "Because $b<10^b$ for all $b>0$, it follows that $\\log_{10}b<b$.  If $b\\geq 1$, then $0<\\left(\\log_{10}b\\right)/b^2<1$, so $a$ cannot be an integer. Therefore $0<b<1$, so $\\log_{10}b<0$ and $a =\n\\left(\\log_{10}b\\right)/b^2<0$.  Thus $a<0<b<1<1/b$, and the median of the set is $\\boxed{b}$.\n\nNote that the conditions of the problem can be met with $b = 0.1$ and $a = -100$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the median of the given set $\\{0, 1, a, b, 1/b\\}$, we need to first arrange the numbers in order. \n\nSince $b$ is a positive number, we know that $1/b$ is also positive. \n\nFor the given equation $ab^2 = \\log_{10} b$, we can see that $b$ must be greater than 1 because the logarithm of a number greater than 1 is positive. Therefore, $1/b$ will be between 0 and 1.\n\nThe given equation also implies that $b$ cannot be equal to 1, because in that case, $ab^2$ would be equal to 0, which is not equal to $\\log_{10} 1$ (which is 0). However, since $\\log_{10} 1$ is 0, and $ab^2 = \\log_{10} b$ must be equal to 0, it must be the case that a is 0 because $b$ cannot be 1 and $b$ is not 0 because it is a positive number.\n\nHowever, a cannot be 0 because it is a nonzero integer. This is a contradiction, and it implies that the problem cannot be solved using the given information."
