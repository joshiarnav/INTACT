    "problem": "A parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is reflected about the $x$-axis. The parabola and its reflection are translated horizontally five units in opposite directions to become the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$, respectively. Which of the following describes the graph of $y=(f+g)(x)$?\n\n(A) a parabola tangent to the $x$-axis\n(B) a parabola not tangent to the $x$-axis\n(C) a horizontal line\n(D) a non-horizontal line\n(E) the graph of a cubic function",
    "solution": "Write the equation of the original parabola as $y = a(x - h)^2 + k,$ where $a \\neq 0.$  Then the equation of the reflected parabola is\n\\[y = -a(x - h)^2 - k.\\]When the parabolas are translated horizontally by 5 units, in opposite directions, their equations become\n\\[y = a(x - h \\pm 5)^2 + k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -a(x - h \\mp 5)^2 - k.\\]The sum of these expressions is\n\\[\\pm 20ax \\mp 20ah = \\pm 20a (x - h),\\]which is the equation of a non-horizontal line.  The answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(D)}}.$",

    "model_solution": "The equation of the original parabola is $y = ax^2 + bx + c$. \n\nWhen it is reflected about the x-axis, the equation becomes $y = -ax^2 - bx - c$.\n\nWhen the original parabola is translated 5 units to the right, the equation becomes $y = a(x-5)^2 + b(x-5) + c = a(x^2-10x+25) + bx - 5b + c = ax^2 -10ax + 25a + bx - 5b + c$.\n\nWhen the reflected parabola is translated 5 units to the left, the equation becomes $y = -a(x+5)^2 - b(x+5) - c = -a(x^2 + 10x + 25) - bx - 5b - c = -ax^2 - 10ax - 25a - bx - 5b - c$.\n\nWhen we add the two equations together, we get $y = (f+g)(x) = (ax^2 -10ax + 25a + bx - 5b + c) + (-ax^2 - 10ax - 25a - bx - 5b - c)$, which simplifies to $y = -20ax - 10b$. \n\nThis equation represents a non-horizontal line. \n\nThe correct answer is (D)."
