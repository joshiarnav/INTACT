    "problem": "For which value of $x$ does the function $f(x) = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}$ cross its horizontal asymptote?",
    "solution": "The horizontal asymptote of $f$ is the horizontal line that $f$ approaches as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. When the leading terms of the numerator and denominator have the same degree, that line is at the value equal to the ratio of the leading coefficients, namely $y = 2/1 = 2$. Setting this equal to $f(x)$, $$f(x) = 2 = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}.$$Clearing the denominator, $$2(x^2 - 4x + 1) = 2x^2 - 8x + 2 = 2x^2 - 5x - 7 \\Longrightarrow 3x = 9 \\Longrightarrow x = \\boxed{3}.$$",

    "model_solution": "To find the horizontal asymptote of the function $f(x) = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}$, we need to compare the degrees of the numerator and denominator.\n\nSince both the numerator and denominator are quadratic expressions, the degree of the numerator is 2 and the degree of the denominator is also 2. \n\nIn this case, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients of the numerator and denominator, which is $\\frac{2}{1} = 2$.\n\nTo find the value of $x$ where the function crosses this horizontal asymptote, we need to set the function equal to the horizontal asymptote and solve for $x$:\n\n$\\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1} = 2$\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n$2x^2 - 5x - 7 = 2(x^2 - 4x + 1)$\n\nExpanding the right-hand side, we get:\n\n$2x^2 - 5x - 7 = 2x^2 - 8x + 2$\n\nSubtracting $2x^2$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$-5x - 7 = -8x + 2$\n\nAdding $8x$ to both sides, we get:\n\n$3x - 7 = 2$\n\nAdding 7 to both sides, we get:\n\n$3x = 9$\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{9}{3}$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$x = 3$\n\nTherefore, the function crosses its horizontal asymptote at $x = 3$."
