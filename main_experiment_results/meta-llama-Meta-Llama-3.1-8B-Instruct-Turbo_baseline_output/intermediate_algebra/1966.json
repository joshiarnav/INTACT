    "model_solution": "In a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant, called the common ratio, $r$. \n\nWe are given $a_1 = 1$, so $a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r = 1 \\cdot r = r$, and $a_3 = a_2 \\cdot r = r \\cdot r = r^2$.\n\nNow we are looking for the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2$.\n\nTo find the minimum, we can complete the square on $4r + 5r^2$. \n\n$4r + 5r^2 = 5\\left(r^2+\\frac{4}{5}r\\right) = 5\\left(r^2+\\frac{4}{5}r+\\frac{4}{25}\\right)-\\frac{4}{5} = 5\\left(r+\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2-\\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nThis expression is minimized when $r + \\frac{2}{5} = 0$, so $r = -\\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nSubstituting this value back in, we find that the minimum of $4r + 5r^2$ is $5\\left(-\\frac{2}{5}+\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2-\\frac{4}{5}=-\\frac{4}{5}$."
