    "model_solution": "To find the distance between the foci of the ellipse, we need to first rewrite the equation of the ellipse in standard form. \n\nWe start by completing the square for both x and y terms:\n\n$16x^2 - 64x + y^2 + 4y + 4 = 0$\n\n$16(x^2 - 4x) + (y^2 + 4y) = -4$\n\nNow, let's complete the square:\n\n$16(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 + 4y + 4) = -4 + 64 + 4$\n\n$16(x - 2)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 64$\n\nNow, divide the entire equation by 64 to get the standard form of the ellipse:\n\n$\\frac{(x - 2)^2}{4} + \\frac{(y + 2)^2}{64} = 1$\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that $a^2 = 64$ and $b^2 = 4$. \n\nWe can now find the distance between the foci using the formula $c = \\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}$. \n\n$c = \\sqrt{64 - 4}$\n$c = \\sqrt{60}$\n\nNow, we can find the distance between the foci using the formula $2c$. \n\n$2c = 2\\sqrt{60}$\n\nWe can simplify this by rationalizing the denominator:\n\n$2c = 2\\sqrt{4*15}$\n$2c = 2\\sqrt{4}*\\sqrt{15}$\n$2c = 4\\sqrt{15}$\n\nSo the distance between the foci of the ellipse is $4\\sqrt{15}$."
