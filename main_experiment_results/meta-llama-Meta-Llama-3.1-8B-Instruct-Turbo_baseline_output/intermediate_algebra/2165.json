    "model_solution": "To find the remainder when a polynomial is divided by another, we can use polynomial long division or the remainder theorem. \n\nThe remainder theorem states that if a polynomial f(x) is divided by (x - a), the remainder is equal to f(a). \n\nHowever, in this case, the divisor is not in the form (x - a), but rather (2x - 6). To apply the remainder theorem, we need to rewrite the divisor in the form (x - a). \n\nFirst, divide both sides of the equation 2x - 6 = 0 by 2, which gives x - 3 = 0.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the divisor as (x - 3).\n\nUsing the remainder theorem, we can find the remainder by substituting x = 3 into the original polynomial and solving for the result.\n\nf(x) = 6x^4 - 14x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 26\nf(3) = 6(3)^4 - 14(3)^3 - 4(3)^2 + 2(3) - 26\n= 6(81) - 14(27) - 4(9) + 6 - 26\n= 486 - 378 - 36 + 6 - 26\n= 52\n\nSo, the remainder when 6x^4 - 14x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 26 is divided by 2x - 6 is 52.\n\nHowever, the remainder should be in the form of a polynomial of degree less than the divisor, and in this case, it should be a constant. \n\nThe result of 52 is actually the remainder when the polynomial is divided by (x - 3), not 2x - 6.\n\nLet's rewrite 2x - 6 to look like (x - a). \n\n2x - 6 = 2(x - 3), so the remainder will be 2 times the result from (x - 3). \n\nThe result from (x - 3) was 52. \n\nThe remainder from 2(x - 3) will be 2 * 52 = 104.\n\nSo, the remainder when 6x^4 - 14x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 26 is divided by 2x - 6 is 104."
