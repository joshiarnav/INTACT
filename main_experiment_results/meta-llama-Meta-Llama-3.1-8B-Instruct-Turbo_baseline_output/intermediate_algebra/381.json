The polynomial has 1 sign change (from positive to negative), so there is exactly 1 positive real solution.\n\nTherefore, the equation $x^{10}+7x^9+14x^8+1729x^7-1379x^6=0$ has exactly 1 positive real solution.\n\nTo check the possibility of $x$ being real and negative we must analyze in deeper detail this factored polynomial or try to find the root numerically."
