    "solution": "Let $z = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.  Then $|z| = 5$ becomes $x^2 + y^2 = 25,$ and $f(z) = z$ becomes\n\\[i(x - yi) = x + yi.\\]Then $ix + y = x + yi,$ so $x = y.$\n\nHence, $2x^2 = 25,$ which has two solutions.  Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ such values of $z.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the solution, we start with the equation $f(z) = z$. \n\nWe have $f(z) = i\\overline{z}$ and $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.\n\nSo, we have $i\\overline{z} = z$.\n\nSubstituting $z = x + yi$ into the above equation, we get $i(x - yi) = x + yi$.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get $ix + y = x + yi$.\n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts on both sides, we get:\n\n- $y = x$\n- $x = y$\n\nWe are also given that $|z| = 5$. This is equivalent to $x^2 + y^2 = 25$.\n\nSubstituting $y = x$ into the above equation, we get $x^2 + x^2 = 25$.\n\nThis simplifies to $2x^2 = 25$, or $x^2 = 25/2$.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $x = \\pm \\sqrt{25/2} = \\pm 5/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSince $y = x$, we also have $y = \\pm 5/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the two solutions for $z$ are $z = 5/\\sqrt{2} + 5/\\sqrt{2}i$ and $z = -5/\\sqrt{2} + 5/\\sqrt{2}i$.\n\nHence, there are 2 values of $z$ that satisfy both $|z| = 5$ and $f(z) = z$."
