    "model_solution": "According to the Remainder Theorem, when a polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by $x - c,$ the remainder is $f(c).$  In this case, $f(x) = ax^3 - 6x^2 + bx - 5.$  We are given that when $f(x)$ is divided by $x - 1,$ the remainder is $-5$ and when $f(x)$ is divided by $x + 2,$ the remainder is $-53.$\n\nWe can apply the Remainder Theorem to get the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\na - 6 + b - 5 & = -5,\\\\\n-8a - 24 - 2b - 5 & = -53.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSimplifying the equations, we get the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\na + b - 11 & = -5,\\\\\n-8a - 2b - 29 & = -53.\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, solving the first equation for $b,$ we get:\n\n$b = -5 - a + 11 = a + 6.$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $b$ into the second equation, we get:\n\n$-8a - 2(a + 6) - 29 = -53.$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$-10a - 43 = -53.$\n\nAdding 43 to both sides, we get:\n\n$-10a = -10.$\n\nDividing both sides by $-10,$ we get:\n\n$a = 1.$\n\nSubstituting $a = 1$ into the expression $b = a + 6$ from above, we get:\n\n$b = 1 + 6 = 7.$\n\nTherefore, the ordered pair $(a, b)$ is $(1, 7).$"
