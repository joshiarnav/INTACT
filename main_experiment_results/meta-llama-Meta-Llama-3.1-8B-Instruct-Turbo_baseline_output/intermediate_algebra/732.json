    "problem": "You have a rectangular prism box with length $x+5$ units, width $x-5$ units, and height $x^{2}+25$ units. For how many positive integer values of $x$ is the volume of the box less than 700 units?",
    "solution": "To find the volume of the box, we multiply the three dimensions: $(x+5)(x-5)(x^{2}+25) = (x^{2}-25)(x^{2}+25) = x^{4}-625$. We want to find $x$ such that $x^{4}-625<700$, which simplifies to $x^{4}<1325$. Taking the fourth root shows us that $x$ is less than $\\sqrt[4]{1325}$, which is between 6 and 7 (since $6^4=1296$ while $7^4=2401$). So $x$ could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, we see that the width is $x-5$ units, and this must be a positive number, so the only value of $x$ which works is 6. Thus, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ possible value of $x$.",

    "model_solution": "The volume of a rectangular prism box is given by the formula V = length * width * height.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the box, the volume V can be calculated as follows:\n\nV = (x + 5) * (x - 5) * (x^2 + 25)\n\nUsing the difference of squares identity a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b), we can simplify the expression for V as follows:\n\nV = (x^2 - 25) * (x^2 + 25)\nV = x^4 - 625\n\nSince x^4 - 625 < 700, we need to find the values of x that satisfy this inequality.\n\nx^4 - 625 < 700\nx^4 < 1325\n\nTaking the fourth root of both sides, we get:\n\nx < \u221c1325\n\nEvaluating the fourth root, we get:\n\nx < 6.88\n\nSince x is a positive integer, the possible values of x are:\n\nx = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n\nHowever, we need to check if the width x - 5 is positive for each of these values of x, since the width cannot be negative.\n\nFor x = 1, the width is 1 - 5 = -4, which is not positive.\nFor x = 2, the width is 2 - 5 = -3, which is not positive.\nFor x = 3, the width is 3 - 5 = -2, which is not positive.\nFor x = 4, the width is 4 - 5 = -1, which is not positive.\nFor x = 5, the width is 5 - 5 = 0, which is not positive.\nFor x = 6, the width is 6 - 5 = 1, which is positive.\n\nTherefore, there is only one positive integer value of x for which the volume of the box is less than 700 units: x = 6."
