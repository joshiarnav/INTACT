    "problem": "If the seven-digit number $854n526$ is divisible by $11$, what is $n$?",
    "solution": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$.",

If the result is divisible by 11, then the original number is also divisible by 11.\n\nFor the number $854n526$, we will subtract and add the alternating digits as follows: \n\n$8 - 4 + 5 - n + 5 - 2 + 6$\n\nCombine the constants: \n$8 - 4 + 5 + 5 - 2 + 6 = 18$\n\nNow, the equation becomes: \n$18 - n$\n\nSince the result must be divisible by 11, we can try out possible values for $n$:\n\n$18 - n = 0$, then $n = 18$ but $n$ cannot be greater than 9.\n$18 - n = 11$, then $n = 7$\n\nTherefore, $n$ is 7."
