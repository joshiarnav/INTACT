    "problem": "When an integer is divided by 15, the remainder is 7. Find the sum of the remainders when the same integer is divided by 3 and by 5.",
    "solution": "We let our integer be $n$.  the first sentence tells us that  \\[n\\equiv 7\\pmod {15}.\\] Since 3 and 5 are both factors of 15 we deduce \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv2\\pmod5.\n\\end{align*} Therefore the remainders in question are 1 and 2, and their sum is $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's call the integer 'n'. We know that when 'n' is divided by 15, the remainder is 7. This can be represented as:\n\nn = 15k + 7\n\nwhere k is a non-negative integer.\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when 'n' is divided by 3. We can rewrite 'n' as:\n\nn = 15k + 7\nn = (3 * 5k) + 7\n\nSince 3 * 5k is a multiple of 3, it will not contribute to the remainder when 'n' is divided by 3. Therefore, the remainder will be the same as the remainder when 7 is divided by 3, which is 1.\n\nSimilarly, we can find the remainder when 'n' is divided by 5:\n\nn = 15k + 7\nn = (5 * 3k) + 2\n\nSince 5 * 3k is a multiple of 5, it will not contribute to the remainder when 'n' is divided by 5. Therefore, the remainder will be the same as the remainder when 2 is divided by 5, which is 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of these remainders:\n\nSum of remainders = Remainder when 'n' is divided by 3 + Remainder when 'n' is divided by 5\nSum of remainders = 1 + 2\nSum of remainders = 3\n\nTherefore, the sum of the remainders when the same integer is divided by 3 and by 5 is 3."
