    "problem": "The American Mathematics College is holding its orientation for incoming freshmen. The incoming freshman class contains fewer than $500$ people. When the freshmen are told to line up in columns of $23$, $22$ people are in the last column. When the freshmen are told to line up in columns of $21$, $14$ people are in the last column. How many people are in the incoming freshman class?",
    "solution": "If $n$ is the number of people in the incoming class, then $n$ yields a remainder of $14$ when divided by $21$. Since both 21 and 14 are divisible by 7, this means that $n$ is divisible by $7$. Define $k=n/7$, and note that $7k \\equiv 14\\pmod{21}$. Dividing by 7, we get $k\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. Multiplying by 7 again, we get $n\\equiv 14\\pmod{3}$, which implies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. So we are looking for a solution to the following system of linear congruences: \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}, \\\\\nn&\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3},\\\\\nn&\\equiv 22 \\pmod{23}. \\\\\n\\end{align*} First, we look for a solution to the last two congruences. Checking numbers that are one less than a multiple of 23, we find that 68 satisfies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $n$ which satisfy both of the last two congruences are precisely those that differ from 68 by a multiple of $3\\cdot 23=69$. Checking $68+69$, $68+2\\cdot 69$, etc. we find that $68 + 5\\cdot 69 = \\boxed{413}$ is the least positive solution to the last two congruences which is also divisible by 7. Note that, by the Chinese remainder theorem again, the solutions of the above system of three congruences are precisely the positive integers that differ from 413 by a multiple of $7\\cdot3\\cdot23=483,$ so 413 is indeed the only solution between 0 and 500.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of people in the incoming freshman class. \n\nWhen the freshmen line up in columns of 23, 22 people are in the last column. This means that the total number of people is 22 more than a multiple of 23.\n\nWhen the freshmen line up in columns of 21, 14 people are in the last column. This means that the total number of people is 14 more than a multiple of 21.\n\nLet's denote the total number of people as N. We can write two equations based on the given information:\n\nN = 23a + 22  (1)\nN = 21b + 14  (2)\n\nwhere a and b are integers.\n\nWe can rewrite equation (1) as:\nN - 22 = 23a\n\nSince N - 22 is a multiple of 23, it follows that N - 22 is also a multiple of 21 (by the Chinese Remainder Theorem).\n\nWe can rewrite equation (2) as:\nN - 14 = 21b\n\nSince N - 14 is a multiple of 21, we can write:\nN - 22 - 14 + 14 = 23a - 21b\n(23a - 21b) + 8 = 14\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n(23a - 21b) = 6\n\nSince (23a - 21b) is a multiple of 21, it must be either 0 or a multiple of 21. However, (23a - 21b) cannot be 0, since 23a is a multiple of 23 and (23a - 21b) is a multiple of 21. Therefore, (23a - 21b) must be a multiple of 21.\n\nThe smallest positive integer that satisfies this equation is (23a - 21b) = 6*21 = 126.\n\nWe can write:\n126 = 23a - 21b\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n23a - 21b = 126\n23a = 21b + 126\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n23a - 21b = 126\n\na = (21b + 126) / 23\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\na = 21b/23 + 126/23\n\nSince a is an integer, (21b/23) must also
