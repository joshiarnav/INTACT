    "problem": "What is the $100$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{3}{26}$ is expressed as a decimal?",
    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block. We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$. Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the decimal representation of the fraction $\\frac{3}{26}$, we can use long division. \n\nHowever, a quicker method to express $\\frac{3}{26}$ as a decimal is to notice that $\\frac{1}{26}$ is the same as $0.0384\\overline{615384}$ (since $26$ is a factor of $10^6 - 1$), and then multiply by $3$.\n\nSo $\\frac{3}{26}$ is $0.115384615384\\overline{615384}$, which is a repeating block of the digits $115384$. Since the repeating block has $6$ digits, we need to find the position of the $100$th digit within this repeating block.\n\nWe can do this by taking the remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$: $99 \\div 6$ is $16$ remainder $3$, which means the $100$th digit is the third digit within the repeating block. \n\nTherefore, the $100$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{3}{26}$ is expressed as a decimal is $\\boxed{5}$."
