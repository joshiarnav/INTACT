We can check that our answer works by plugging our value for triangle into the original problem: $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & 3 & 2 & 1 & 5_6\\\\ & & & 5 & 4 & 0_6\\\\ &+ & & & 5 & 2_6\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & 4 & 2 & 5 & 1_6.\\\\ \\end{array} $$The addition problem still works, so our answer is correct.",

    "model_solution": "To solve for $\\triangle$, we can analyze the units column first. The number $\\triangle_6 + 0_6 + 2_6 = 1_6$ with a carry of 1 to the next column. Since we are working in base 6, the sum of $\\triangle + 2$ divided by 6 should be equal to or one less than the units digit 1. \n\nThe only carry is possible when the sum is equal to or higher than 6. This means the possible values of $\\triangle$ could be 4 or 5 since 4+2 = 10 in base 10 which would be 14 in base 6 with 1 carry and 5+2 = 7 in base 10 which is 11 in base 6 with 1 carry.\n\nNext, we need to check the carry in the hundreds column. We know that the sum of $1_6 + \\triangle + 4_6$ should be equal to $\\triangle_6$ or one less than it due to the carry from the units column. We can plug in the possible values of $\\triangle$ to find the valid solution.\n\nIf we plug in $\\triangle = 4$, we get $1_6 + 4_6 + 4_6 = 13_6$ or $1 + 4 + 4 = 9$ in base 10. This gives us a result of 3 in the hundreds column, which does not match $\\triangle_6$.\n\nIf we plug in $\\triangle = 5$, we get $1_6 + 5_6 + 4_6 = 24_6$ or $1 + 5 + 4 = 10$ in base 10. This gives us a result of 4 in the hundreds column, which does not match $\\triangle_6$.\n\nHowever if we plug in $\\triangle = 5$ and consider the carry, we get $\\triangle + 1 + 4$ divided by 6 with 1 carry. This means that the number 1 in the hundreds column should be 4 in base 6. Hence, we must include 1 as a carry from the tens column.\n\nConsidering the tens column, the sum of $2_6 + \\triangle + 4_6 + 1$ (from the hundreds column) should be equal to the carry divided by 6 plus 2. The only valid solution is $\\triangle = 5$ and 1 as a carry from the hundreds column.\n\nSince we now know that $\\triangle = 5$, we can confirm our answer by plugging in 5 into the original problem.\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & 3 & 2 & 1 & 5_6\\\\ & & & 5 & 4 & 0_6\\\\ &+ & & & 5 & 2_6\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & 4 & 2 & 5 & 1_6\\\\ \\end{array} $$"
