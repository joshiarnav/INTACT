    "problem": "What is the sum of all integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer?",
    "solution": "The expression $2n-1$ is odd for every integer $n$, and conversely every odd integer takes the form $2n-1$ for some integer $n$.  Therefore, there is one solution $n$ for each (not necessarily positive) odd divisor of 20.  The positive odd divisors of 20 are 1 and 5, so we solve $2n-1=-5$, $2n-1=-1$, $2n-1=1$, and $2n-1=5$ to find the solutions $n=-2$, $n=0$, $n=1$, and $n=3$.  These values for $n$ sum to $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the values of $n$ such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer, we need to find all the factors of 20 and check which of them can be expressed in the form $2n - 1$. \n\nThe factors of 20 are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm5, \\pm10, \\pm20$. \n\nWe need to find the odd factors since they can be expressed in the form $2n - 1$. The odd factors of 20 are $\\pm1, \\pm5$. \n\nNow we need to solve the equations:\n1. $2n - 1 = 1$\n2. $2n - 1 = 5$\n3. $2n - 1 = -1$\n4. $2n - 1 = -5$\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n1. $n = 1$\n2. $n = 3$\n3. $n = 0$\n4. $n = -2$\n\nThe sum of all these integer values of $n$ is $1 + 3 + 0 + (-2) = 2$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer is 2."
