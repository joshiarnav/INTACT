    "problem": "Find the residue of $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$.",
    "solution": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7. So the residue of the sum is  $$\n182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\equiv \\boxed{10} \\pmod{14}.\n$$",

    "model_solution": "To find the residue of the given expression, we first need to simplify it. \n\nWe start by calculating $182 \\cdot 12 = 2184$, $15 \\cdot 7 = 105$, and subtracting 105 from 2184 gives 2079. Adding 3 to this gives 2082.\n\nNow, we need to find the residue of 2082 modulo 14. \n\nTo simplify this, we can divide 2082 by 14. \n\n$2082 \\div 14 = 148$ remainder 10.\n\nSo, the residue of 2082 modulo 14 is 10.\n\nTherefore, the residue of $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\pmod{14}$ is 10."
