    "model_solution": "The first two-digit multiple of 7 is 14 and the last is 98. \n\nTo find the number of two-digit multiples of 7, we can use the formula: \n\nNumber of terms = (Last term - First term) / Common Difference + 1\n\nNumber of terms = (98 - 14) / 7 + 1\nNumber of terms = 84 / 7 + 1\nNumber of terms = 12 + 1\nNumber of terms = 13\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:\n\nSum = (Number of terms * (First term + Last term)) / 2\n\nSum = (13 * (14 + 98)) / 2\nSum = (13 * 112) / 2\nSum = 1456 / 2\nSum = 728\n\nThe arithmetic mean is the sum divided by the number of terms:\n\nArithmetic mean = Sum / Number of terms\nArithmetic mean = 728 / 13\nArithmetic mean = 56.56 (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nSo, the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7 is approximately 56.56."
