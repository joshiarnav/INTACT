    "problem": "What is $2343_6+15325_6$? Express your answer in base $6$.",
    "solution": "Adding the first digits, we get $8$, hence $2$ after carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, again with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $2$, with carrying. Finally, adding $1$ to one, we get $2$. Thus our final answer is $\\boxed{22112_6}$.",

    "model_solution": "To add $2343_6$ and $15325_6$, we will perform the addition column by column from right to left.\n\n1. The rightmost column:\n   - $3_6 + 5_6 = 12_6 = 1 \\times 6^1 + 2_6$\n   - We write down the result as $12_6$ and carry over the $1$.\n\n2. The second rightmost column:\n   - $4_6 + 2_6 = 10_6 = 1 \\times 6^1 + 4_6$\n   - We write down the result as $4_6$ and carry over the $1$.\n\n3. The third rightmost column:\n   - $3_6 + 3_6 = 10_6 = 1 \\times 6^1 + 4_6$\n   - We write down the result as $4_6$ and carry over the $1$.\n\n4. The fourth rightmost column:\n   - $2_6 + 2_6 = 4_6$\n   - We write down the result as $4_6$.\n\n5. The leftmost column:\n   - $2_6 + 1_6 = 3_6$\n\nNow we combine all the results: \n$13414_6$\n\nSo, $2343_6+15325_6 = 13414_6$."
