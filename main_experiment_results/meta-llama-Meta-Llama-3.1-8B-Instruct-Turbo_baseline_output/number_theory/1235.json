    "problem": "A number is divisible by $9$ if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9.$ For example, the number $19\\,836$ is divisible by $9$ but $19\\,825$ is not.\n\nIf $D\\,767\\,E89$ is divisible by $9,$ where $D$ and $E$ each represent a single digit, what is the sum of all possible values of the sum $D+E?$",
    "solution": "For $D\\,767\\,E89$ to be divisible by $9,$ we must have $$D+7+6+7+E+8+9 = 37+D+E$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $D$ and $E$ are each a single digit, we know each is between $0$ and $9.$ Therefore, $D+E$ is between $0$ and $18.$ Therefore, $37+D+E$ is between $37$ and $55.$ The numbers between $37$ and $55$ that are divisible by $9$ are $45$ and $54.$\n\nIf $37+D+E=45,$ then $D+E=8.$\n\nIf $37+D+E=54,$ then $D+E=17.$\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $D+E$ are $8$ and $17.$ Our answer is then $8+17=\\boxed{25}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the possible values of $D$ and $E$, we need to find the possible values of $D + E$ that make the sum of the digits of $D\\,767\\,E89$ divisible by $9$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the digits of $D\\,767\\,E89$:\n\\[D + 7 + 6 + 7 + E + 8 + 9 = D + E + 37\\]\n\nSince $D\\,767\\,E89$ is divisible by $9,$ we know that $D + E + 37$ is divisible by $9.$ This means that $D + E + 37$ must be equal to $9k$ for some integer $k.$\n\nWe can write an equation to represent this:\n\\[D + E + 37 = 9k\\]\n\nWe can subtract 37 from both sides:\n\\[D + E = 9k - 37\\]\n\nSince $D$ and $E$ are single digits, they can only take on values from 0 to 9. Therefore, we can find the possible values of $k$ that make $9k - 37$ a two-digit number (i.e., a number between 10 and 99).\n\nWe want to find the values of $k$ such that $10 \\le 9k - 37 \\le 99$. We can add 37 to all parts of the inequality:\n\\[47 \\le 9k \\le 136\\]\n\nWe can divide all parts of the inequality by 9:\n\\[5.222 \\le k \\le 15.111\\]\n\nSince $k$ must be an integer, the possible values of $k$ are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n\nNow, we can find the possible values of $D + E$ by plugging in these values of $k$ into the equation $D + E = 9k - 37$. We get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nD + E &= 9(6) - 37 = 27 - 37 = -10\\\\\nD + E &= 9(7) - 37 = 63 - 37 = 26\\\\\nD + E &= 9(8) - 37 = 72 - 37 = 35\\\\\nD + E &= 9(9) - 37 = 81 - 37 = 44\\\\\nD + E &= 9(10) - 37 = 90 - 37 = 53\\\\\nD + E &= 9(11) - 37 = 99 - 37 = 62\\\\\nD + E &= 9(12) - 37 = 108 - 37 = 71\\\\\nD + E &= 9(13) - 37 = 117 - 37 = 80\\\\\nD + E &= 9(14) - 37 = 126 - 37 = 89\\\\\nD + E &= 9(15) - 37 = 135 - 37 = 98\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $D + E$ cannot be negative, we can disregard the value $D + E = -10.$\n\nThe sum of all possible values of $D + E$ is $26 + 35 + 44 + 53 + 62 + 71 + 80 + 89 + 98 = \\boxed{458}.$"
