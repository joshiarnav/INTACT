    "problem": "What is the largest number, with its digits all different, whose digits add up to 16?",
    "solution": "For a number to be as large as possible, we want as many places (digits) as possible. To allow for as many digits as possible, we want the digits to be small so that there will be more digits that add up to $16$. We start with the smallest number, $0$ and keep adding the next number. $0+1+2+3+4=10$. However, we cannot add $5$, because then we are left with $16-10-5=1$, and we already have the number $1$. Therefore, the next number to be added would be $16-10=6$.\nNow, we have the numbers $0,1,2,3,4,6$ to form a number. We want the larger places to have larger numbers. Therefore, we order the numbers in decreasing order to form the number $\\boxed{643210}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest number with all different digits that add up to 16, we should start with the largest possible digit, which is 9. \n\nWe can start with 9 as the first digit, and subtract 9 from 16 to get 7. \n\nWe can then use the next largest digit, which is 8, and subtract 8 from 7 to get -1. However, we can't use a negative number, and we can't reuse digits, so we should find the next largest digit that is less than 7, and that is 6. \n\nIf we subtract 6 from 7, we get 1. \n\nWe can then use the next largest digits, which are 5, 4, 3, and 2, and then 1, to get 123465. \n\nHowever, we can also use 123647 instead, since 7 is larger than 6.\n\nSo, the largest number with all different digits that add up to 16 is 1236549 and  123647"
