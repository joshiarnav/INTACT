    "problem": "What is the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 which has two even and two odd digits?",
    "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits, consider the divisibility rule for 9: a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n\nThe smallest four-digit number is 1000. A sum of digits of 10 is not divisible by 9. \n\nSince we want a sum of digits divisible by 9, we should start with the smallest digits that will give us a sum divisible by 9. The smallest possible sum of digits for a four-digit number with two even and two odd digits that is divisible by 9 would be 18 (since 1 + 8 is odd and even and 9 is divisible by 9).\n\nThe arrangement of 18 (1 and 8) with the smallest possible digits (0 and 1) for the other two digits gives us 1089. However, this has three odd digits and only one even digit.\n\nFor the next possible sum of digits (18), we can consider arranging the digits in a way that gives us two even digits and two odd digits. One arrangement is 1890 and another is 1089 is not suitable, but 1890 is and another suitable arrangement for the sum of 18 is 1809.\n\nHowever, we can get a smaller number with the sum of 18 by rearranging 1809 to get 1890 or 9180, but 9180 is the smallest four-digit number."
