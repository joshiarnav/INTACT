    "problem": "The number $n$ is a prime number between 20 and 30. If you divide $n$ by 8, the remainder is 5. What is the value of $n$?",
    "solution": "We look at multiples of 8 greater than 15 and less than 25 (since adding 5 should make the number between 20 and 30). So the multiples of 8 that we consider are 16 and 24. Adding 5, we get 21 and 29. Only 29 is a prime number so $n=\\boxed{29}$.\n\nOR\n\nWhen we divide 20 by 8, we get a remainder of 4. That means 21 will have a remainder of 5. The next number with a remainder of 5 would be $21+8=29$. When we consider 21 and 29, $\\boxed{29}$ is the prime number.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find a prime number between 20 and 30 that leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 8.\n\nFirst, let's list the multiples of 8 between 20 and 30: 24. \n\nThe next multiple of 8 after 24 is 32, which is outside the given range. We need to find a number that is 5 more than a multiple of 8. The only number between 20 and 30 that satisfies this condition is:\n\n24 + 5 = 29\n\nNow, we need to check if 29 is a prime number. A prime number is a positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1.\n\n29 can only be divided by 1 and 29, so it is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the value of n is 29."
