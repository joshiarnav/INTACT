    "solution": "We start by testing palindromic sequences in base 4. Since the positive integer must be greater than 5, we start by analyzing $22_4$, which is $1010_2$. We then test $33_4$, which is $1111_2$. Converting to base 10, we have $33_4 = 3(4) + 3 = \\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome when written in both base 2 and 4, we will start with the smallest possible palindromes in base 4 and convert them to base 2 and then base 10.\n\nThe smallest possible palindromes in base 4 are 11, 22, and 33. We will convert them to base 2:\n\n- 11 in base 4 is 101 in base 2.\n- 22 in base 4 is 1010 in base 2.\n- 33 in base 4 is 111 in base 2 (a palindrome).\n\nNow, convert 33 in base 4 to base 10:\n33 in base 4 = 3*4^1 + 3*4^0 = 12 + 3 = 15.\n\nNext, we will check if there are smaller palindromes in base 4 that are also palindromes in base 2 and have a base-10 value greater than 5. Let's check the next smallest possible palindrome in base 4, which is 101.\n\n- 101 in base 4 is 1101001 in base 2 (not a palindrome).\n\nNow, let's convert 101 in base 4 to base 10:\n101 in base 4 = 1*4^2 + 0*4^1 + 1*4^0 = 16 + 0 + 1 = 17.\n\nSince 17 is greater than 5 and 15 is the smallest value we found, the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome when written in both base 2 and 4 is 15.\n\nHowever, we need to check if there's a possible smaller value in base 4. The next smallest possible palindrome is 21 (10 in base 4 but we want two-digit numbers), so we will check the next smallest possible palindrome which is 111 in base 4. We already know this is 15 in base 10 but we will check other options.\n\nAnother option is to look for only the smallest values and see what base 4 palindromes are like and then see what base 2 values they are. The smallest base 4 palindrome is actually 11, which is 101 in base 2. Another option is to use the method of looking at base 4 palindromes that are 2 digits long and then convert those to base 10, then convert those to base 2 and check if they are the same.\n\nWe can also look at the smallest possible base 4 palindromes that are two digits long (10, 11, 12, 13, 20, 21, 22, 31, 32, 33) and their corresponding base 2 values. We will convert them to base 10 and check if they are greater than 5.\n\n- 10 in base 4 = 1*4^1 + 0*4^0 = 4 in base 10. (4 is not greater than 5)\n- 11 in base 4 = 3*4^1 + 3*4^0 = 15 in base 10. (15 is greater than 5 and we already know this one)\n- 12 in base 4 = 1*4^1 + 2*4^0 = 6 in base 10. (6 is not greater than 5)\n- 13 in base 4 = 1*4^1 + 3*4^0 = 7 in base 10. (7 is greater than 5)\n- 20 in base 4 = 2*4^1 + 0*4^0 = 8 in base 10. (8 is greater than 5)\n- 21 in base 4 = 2*4^1 + 1*4^0 = 9 in base 10. (9 is greater than 5)\n- 22 in base 4 = 2*4^1 + 2*4^0 = 10 in base 10. (10 is greater than 5)\n- 31 in base 4 = 3*4^1 + 1*4^0 = 13 in base 10. (13 is greater than 5)\n- 32 in base 4 = 3*4^1 + 2*4^0 = 14 in base 10. (14 is greater than 5)\n- 33 in base 4 = 3*4^1 + 3*4^0 = 15 in base 10. (15 is greater than 5 and we already know this one)\n\nNow, let's convert these values to base 2 and check if they are palindromes:\n\n- 13 in base 10 is 1101 in base 2 (a palindrome).\n- 8 in base 10 is 1000 in base 2 (not a palindrome).\n- 9 in base 10 is 1001 in base 2 (a palindrome).\n- 10 in base 10 is 1010 in base 2 (a palindrome).\n- 14 in base 10 is 1110 in base 2 (a palindrome).\n\nThe smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome when written in both base 2 and 4 is 13.\n\nThe smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome when written in both base 2 and 4 is 13."
