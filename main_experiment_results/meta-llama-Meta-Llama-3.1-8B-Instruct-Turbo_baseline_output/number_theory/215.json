    "problem": "What is the units digit of $13^{2003}$?",
    "solution": "Powers of 13 have the same units digit as the corresponding powers of 3; and $$\n3^1 = 3, \\quad 3^2 = 9, \\quad 3^3 = 27, \\quad 3^4 = 81, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 3^5 = 243.\n$$Since the units digit of $3^1$ is the same as the units digit of $3^5$, units digits of powers of 3 cycle through $3, 9, 7,$ and $1$. Hence the units digit of $3^{2000}$ is $1$, so the units digit of $3^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$. The same is true of the units digit of $13^{2003}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the units digit of $13^{2003}$, we need to look for a pattern in the units digits of the powers of 13. \n\nWe start by calculating the units digits of the first few powers of 13:\n- $13^1$ = 13 (units digit: 3)\n- $13^2$ = 169 (units digit: 9)\n- $13^3$ = 2197 (units digit: 7)\n- $13^4$ = 28561 (units digit: 1)\n\nNotice that the units digits repeat in a cycle of 4 (3, 9, 7, 1).\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 2003 is divided by 4. \n2003 mod 4 = 3 (because 2003 = 4*500 + 3).\n\nSince 2003 mod 4 = 3, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is the same as the units digit of $13^3$, which is 7.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is 7."
