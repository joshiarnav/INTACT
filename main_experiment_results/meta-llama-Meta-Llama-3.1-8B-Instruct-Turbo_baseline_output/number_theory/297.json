    "problem": "When $555_{10}$ is expressed in this base, it has 4 digits, in the form ABAB, where A and B are two different digits.  What base is it?",
    "solution": "First, let us find which bases result in $555_{10}$ having four digits. We must find base b such that $b^{4}>555_{10}\\geq b^{3}$. We easily determine that b can range from 5 to 8, inclusive.  We can now try each of these four bases to see which yields a number in the form ABAB.  For base six, we find that $6^{3}=216$, which can go into 555 only two times at most, leaving $555-2\\cdot216 = 123$ for the next three digits. $6^{2}=36$ goes into 123 three times at most, leaving us with $123-3\\cdot36 = 15$. Then, $6^{1}=6$ goes into 15 two times at most, leaving $15-2\\cdot6 = 3$ for the ones digit. So, the base $\\boxed{6}$ equivalent of $555_{10}$ is $2323_{6}$, which satisfies all of the requirements stated.",

    "model_solution": "To find the base, let's assume that the base is 'b'. \n\nGiven that the base 'b' number has 4 digits, we have the inequality b^3 \u2264 555 < b^4.\n\nWe start by trying with small bases and go upwards.\n\n- For b = 4:  4^3 = 64, and 4^4 = 256. It's too small.\n- For b = 5:  5^3 = 125, and 5^4 = 625. It's still too small.\n- For b = 6:  6^3 = 216, and 6^4 = 1296. It's getting closer.\n- For b = 7:  7^3 = 343, and 7^4 = 2401. It's too large.\n\nWe see that when b = 6, it's the largest base that satisfies the inequality.\n\nNow, we need to find a way to express 555 in base 6.\n\n55_10 = 101_6\n\nNow, 555_10 = 2323_6.\n\nAnd indeed, 2323_6 has 4 digits in the form ABAB, where A = 2 and B = 3, and they are two different digits.\n\nTherefore, the base is 6."
