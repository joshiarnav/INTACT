    "problem": "Find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.",
    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we'll start from the largest possible three-digit number (999) and work our way down.\n\nWe need to consider the divisibility rules for each digit. \n\n- For 9, the number must be divisible by 9.\n- For 8, the number must be divisible by 8 (this requires the last three digits of the number to be divisible by 8).\n- For 7, the number must be divisible by 7.\n- For 6, the number must be divisible by 2 and 3.\n- For 5, the number must end in 0 or 5.\n- For 4, the number must be divisible by 4 (this requires the last two digits of the number to be divisible by 4).\n- For 3, the number must be divisible by 3.\n- For 2, the number must be divisible by 2.\n- For 1, the number must be divisible by 1.\n\nConsidering the divisibility rule for 9 (the sum of the digits must be divisible by 9), we'll test numbers with the highest possible hundreds digit, 9. \n\nWe will check 999, 990, 981, and so on, but any number with 9 in the hundreds place is divisible by 9. \n\nA test number that is divisible by 8 is required to have the last 3 digits divisible by 8 (for example 976 is not divisible by 8 but 984 is, 992 is,  980 is). \n\nGiven that the test number must be divisible by 8 and 9 and 7, and 5, we'll check the largest such test number.\n\nWe can check  980 which is divisible by 9 (980/9 = 108.89  which is not an integer, so 980 is not a solution), and 980 is divisible by 8 (980/8 = 122.5 which is not an integer so 980 is not a solution), \n\nHowever,  945 does not meet the requirement for being divisible by 8.\n\nThe  next number down is  936  which  is divisible by 8 and 9 and 6."
