    "model_solution": "To find the values of $n$ such that $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer, we can rewrite $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ as $1 + \\frac{18}{n}$. \n\n$\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer if and only if $\\frac{18}{n}$ is an integer. \n\nTherefore, we need to find the divisors of 18. The divisors of 18 are 1, 18, 2, 9, 3, and 6.\n\nThe sum of these divisors is $1 + 18 + 2 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 39$.\n\nSo, the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer is 39."
