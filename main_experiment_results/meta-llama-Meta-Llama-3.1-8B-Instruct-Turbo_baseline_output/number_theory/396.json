    "problem": "What is the base $2$ representation of $84_{10}$?",
    "solution": "We first find that the largest power of $2$ that is less than $84$ is $2^6 = 64$. Our next step is to find the largest power of $2$ that is less than $84 - 64 = 20$ which is $2^4=16$. This leaves us left with $20 - 16 = 4$, but $4 = 2 ^2$, so we have $$84 = 1 \\cdot 2^6 + 0 \\cdot 2^5 + 1 \\cdot 2^4 + 0 \\cdot 2^3 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 0 \\cdot 2^0.$$Thus, our base $2$ representation of $84_{10}$ is $\\boxed{1010100_2}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the base 2 representation of 84, we'll need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than 84 and then continue subtracting the powers of 2 from 84 until we reach 0.\n\nThe largest power of 2 less than 84 is $2^6 = 64$. \n\n84 - 64 = 20.\n\nNext, we'll find the largest power of 2 less than 20, which is $2^4 = 16$. \n\n20 - 16 = 4.\n\nThe largest power of 2 less than 4 is $2^2 = 4$. \n\nSince we've reached the number we're subtracting (4), we can stop and find the next smaller power of 2 which is $2^1 = 2$. \n\n4 - 2 = 2.\n\nThe largest power of 2 less than 2 is $2^1 = 2$. \n\nSince we've reached the number we're subtracting (2) again, we can stop.\n\nSo, we have 6, 4, 2, and 2. Writing these in the order of the powers of 2 (starting from the largest) gives us the base 2 representation of 84, which is $1010100_2$."
