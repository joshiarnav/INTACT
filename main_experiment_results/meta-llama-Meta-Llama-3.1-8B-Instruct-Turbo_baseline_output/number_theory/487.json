    "model_solution": "To find the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$, we first need to find the value of $x$. \n\nWe are given two congruences:\n$4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$ \nand\n$3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can simplify it by dividing both sides by 4. This gives $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$.\n\nTo make the second equation have the same modulus, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3. This gives $9x\\equiv 48\\pmod{20}$. Since 9 and 20 are not coprime, we can simplify it by dividing both sides by their greatest common divisor, which is 1, and then subtracting the equation $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$ multiplied by 4 from the equation to isolate $x$ in a 5 modulus equation. This gives $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$.\n\nNow, we need to solve the system of congruences to find the value of $x$. Since we have $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$ and $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$, we can see that $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$ satisfies the first congruence.\n\nNow, we need to check if $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$ satisfies the second congruence. \n$3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$\n$3(12)\\equiv 36\\pmod{20}$\n$36\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies both congruences is $\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$. We substitute $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$ into $x^2$ to get $x^2\\equiv 12^2\\pmod{20}$. \n\n$12^2=144$\n\nNow, we can find the remainder when $144$ is divided by $20$. \n\n$144=7\\cdot 20\\Rightarrow r=4$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$ is 4."
