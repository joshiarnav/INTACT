    "problem": "What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}?$",
    "solution": "First, we simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$ to $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, we have $$17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$This means that $17n$ can be written in the form $7a+2$, where $a$ is an integer. So we have $17n=7a+2$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\\frac{7a+2}{17}=n$ is an integer. By trying values for $a$, we find that the smallest integer $a$ which satisfies the equation is $7$. Therefore, the least value for $n$ is $\\frac{51}{17}=\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the remainder of 1234 when divided by 7. \n\n1234 mod 7 = 2\n\nWe now have 17n \u2261 2 (mod 7). We can simplify 17n (mod 7) as 3n (mod 7), since 17 mod 7 = 3.\n\nWe now have 3n \u2261 2 (mod 7). \n\nWe can check the values of n from 0 to 6 to find a value that satisfies 3n \u2261 2 (mod 7). \n\nn = 0: 3*0 \u2261 0 (mod 7) which is not equal to 2.\nn = 1: 3*1 \u2261 3 (mod 7) which is not equal to 2.\nn = 2: 3*2 \u2261 1 (mod 7) which is not equal to 2.\nn = 3: 3*3 \u2261 4 (mod 7) which is not equal to 2.\nn = 4: 3*4 \u2261 2 (mod 7) which is equal to 2.\n\nSo the smallest positive integer n is 4."
