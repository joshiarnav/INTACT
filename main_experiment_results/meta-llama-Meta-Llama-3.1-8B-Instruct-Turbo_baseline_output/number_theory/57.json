    "problem": "When three positive integers are divided by $24$, the remainders are $10,$ $4,$ and $12,$ respectively.\n\nWhen the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, what is the remainder?",
    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 10\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 12\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 10+4+12 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $24$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "When the three integers are divided by $24$, the remainders are $10,$ $4,$ and $12$. \n\nLet's call the three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$. We can write them as follows:\n$a = 24x + 10$\n$b = 24y + 4$\n$c = 24z + 12$\n\nwhere $x$, $y$, and $z$ are integers.\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when $a + b + c$ is divided by $24$.\n\nWe can add the expressions for $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n$a + b + c = (24x + 10) + (24y + 4) + (24z + 12)$\n$a + b + c = 24x + 24y + 24z + 26$\n$a + b + c = 24(x + y + z) + 26$\n\nNow, we can see that $24(x + y + z)$ is a multiple of $24$, so it will leave a remainder of $0$ when divided by $24$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $a + b + c$ is divided by $24$ is the same as the remainder when $26$ is divided by $24$.\n\nWe can find this remainder by subtracting $24$ from $26$:\n$26 - 24 = 2$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$ is $\\boxed{2}$."
