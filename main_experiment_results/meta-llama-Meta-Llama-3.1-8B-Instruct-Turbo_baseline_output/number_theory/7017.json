    "problem": "Let $T = \\{9^k : k ~ \\mbox{is an integer}, 0 \\le k \\le 4000\\}$. Given that $9^{4000}$ has 3817 digits and that its first (leftmost) digit is 9, how many elements of $T$ have 9 as their leftmost digit?\n",
    "solution": "Since $9^{4000}$ has 3816 digits more than $9^1$, $4000 - 3816 = \\boxed{184}$ numbers have 9 as their leftmost digits.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of elements of T that have 9 as their leftmost digit, we need to find the range of values for k where 9^k has a leftmost digit of 9.\n\nSince 9^{4000} has 3817 digits and its first (leftmost) digit is 9, any power of 9 less than 9^{3816} has fewer digits than 3817 and therefore has a leftmost digit of 9.\n\nSo, the range of values for k where 9^k has a leftmost digit of 9 is from 0 to 3815.\n\nThe number of elements of T that have 9 as their leftmost digit is 3815."
