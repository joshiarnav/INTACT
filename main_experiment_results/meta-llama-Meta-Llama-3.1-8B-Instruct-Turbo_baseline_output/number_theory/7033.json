    "problem": "The number $r$ can be expressed as a four-place decimal $0.abcd,$ where $a, b, c,$ and $d$ represent digits, any of which could be zero. It is desired to approximate $r$ by a fraction whose numerator is 1 or 2 and whose denominator is an integer. The closest such fraction to $r$ is $\\frac 27.$ What is the number of possible values for $r$?\n",
    "solution": "The nearest fractions to $\\frac 27$ with numerator $1$ are $\\frac 13, \\frac 14$; and with numerator $2$ are $\\frac 26, \\frac 28 = \\frac 13, \\frac 14$ anyway. For $\\frac 27$ to be the best approximation for $r$, the decimal must be closer to $\\frac 27 \\approx .28571$ than to $\\frac 13 \\approx .33333$ or $\\frac 14 \\approx .25$.\nThus $r$ can range between $\\frac{\\frac 14 + \\frac{2}{7}}{2} \\approx .267857$ and $\\frac{\\frac 13 + \\frac{2}{7}}{2} \\approx .309523$. At $r = .2679, .3095$, it becomes closer to the other fractions, so $.2679 \\le r \\le .3095$ and the number of values of $r$ is $3095 - 2679 + 1 = \\boxed{417}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of possible values for r, we first need to determine the range of values for r. We know that the closest fraction to r is 2/7, so r must be between 2/7 - 1/10000 and 2/7 + 1/10000.\n\nFirst, let's calculate 2/7. To do this, we need to get a denominator that is a multiple of 10000. Since 2/7 is approximately 0.286, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 14286 to get 14286/50000.\n\nNow we can calculate 2/7 + 1/10000 and 2/7 - 1/10000.\n\nThe value of 2/7 + 1/10000 is (14286+1)/50000 = 14287/50000 = 0.28614.\n\nThe value of 2/7 - 1/10000 is (14286-1)/50000 = 14285/50000 = 0.28586.\n\nTherefore, the range of values for r is (0.28586, 0.28614). This is a range of values, and it includes all values between 0.28586 and 0.28614, including 0.28586 and 0.28614 themselves.\n\nSince a, b, c, and d are digits, which can be any of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, there are 10 possibilities for each digit. Therefore, there are 10,000 possible values of r."
