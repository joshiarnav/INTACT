    "problem": "A solid rectangular block is formed by gluing together $N$ congruent 1-cm cubes face to face. When the block is viewed so that three of its faces are visible, exactly $231$ of the 1-cm cubes cannot be seen. Find the smallest possible value of $N.$\n",
    "solution": "The $231$ cubes which are not visible must lie below exactly one layer of cubes. Thus, they form a rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension. If the original block has dimensions $l \\times m \\times n$, we must have $(l - 1)\\times(m-1) \\times(n - 1) = 231$. The prime factorization of $231 = 3\\cdot7\\cdot11$, so we have a variety of possibilities; for instance, $l - 1 = 1$ and $m - 1 = 11$ and $n - 1 = 3 \\cdot 7$, among others. However, it should be fairly clear that the way to minimize $l\\cdot m\\cdot n$ is to make $l$ and $m$ and $n$ as close together as possible, which occurs when the smaller block is $3 \\times 7 \\times 11$. Then the extra layer makes the entire block $4\\times8\\times12$, and $N= \\boxed{384}$.",

    "model_solution": "The non-visible cubes must be the interior cubes of the smaller rectangular block which is formed by cutting out the $231$ non-visible cubes. Let's call the dimensions of the smaller rectangular block $l \\times m \\times (m-1)$ since the non-visible cubes are formed by cutting off a layer from the original block's top and bottom. \n\nThe total number of smaller rectangular blocks required to form the larger block is $l \\times m \\times (m+1)$. Since each block is made of 1 cm cubes, $l \\times m \\times (m+1)$ is the total number of cubes in the larger block.\n\n$l$ can be either $l \\times (m+1) \\times m$ or $m \\times (m+1) \\times l$. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume $l \\times (m+1) \\times m$.

Let's consider the factors of $231$ to make the fraction $\\frac{m^2 + m}{m^2 - m}$ a whole number. \n\nThe prime factorization of $231$ is $3 \\times 7 \\times 11$. \n\nAs the numerator and denominator of the fraction are both polynomials of the same variable $m$, we can select a factor of $231$ which has a factor of $3$ or $7$ but not both. The number of factors of $231$ are: \n\n1. $3$ ($m^2 + m$ = $3$ * $m^2 $/$m^2 -m$)\n2. $7$ ($m^2 + m$ = $7$ * $m^2 $/$m^2 -m$)\n\nThe fraction becomes a whole number in both cases. \n\nSince $m^2 + m$ = $3$ * $m^2 $/$m^2 -m$ $or$ $m^2 + m$ = $7$ * $m^2 $/$m^2 -m$,\nwe can solve for $m$ using substitution.\n\nFor $m^2 + m$ = $3$ * $m^2 $/$m^2 -m$,\n $m^2 + m$ = $\\frac{3m^2}{m^2-m}$\nWe can cross-multiply to simplify the expression:\n\n $m^3 + m^2$ = $3m^2$ \n$ m^3 - 2m^2$ = 0\n$ m^2(m - 2)$ = 0 \nThe possible solutions are $m^2$ = 0 and $m - 2$ = 0.\n For $m^2$ = 0, we get $m$ = 0. \nFor $m - 2$ = 0, we get $m$ = 2.\n \nThe value of $m$ = 2 is the feasible solution.\n\n $m^2 + m$ = $7$ * $m^2 $/$m^2 -m$,\n We can cross-multiply to simplify the expression:\n\n $m^3 + m^2$ = $7m^2$ \n$ m^3 - 6m^2$ = 0\n$ m^2(m - 6)$ = 0 \nThe possible solutions are $m^2$ = 0 and $m - 6$ = 0.\n For $m^2$ = 0, we get $m$ = 0. \nFor $m - 6$ = 0, we get $m$ = 6.\n \nThe value of $m$ = 6 is the feasible solution.\n\nLet's consider the feasible values of $m$ we got from the previous equations.\nWe got $m$ = 2 and $m$ = 6.\n\nWe can use the feasible values of $m$ to get the value of $l$.\n$l \\times m \\times (m-1)$ = $231$ \n$l \\times 2 \\times (2-1)$ = $231$\n$l \\times 2 \\times 1$ = $231$\n$l \\times 2$ = $231$\n$l$ = $\\frac{231}{2}$\n$l$ = $115.5$\n$l$ can't be a fraction as we are talking about a rectangular block made up of cubes.\n\n $l \\times m \\times (m-1)$ = $231$ \n$l \\times 6 \\times (6-1)$ = $231$\n$l \\times 6 \\times 5$ = $231$\n$l \\times 30$ = $231$\n$l$ = $\\frac{231}{30}$\n$l$ is not a feasible value as it's not an integer.\n\nThe feasible value of $m$ = 6 and the corresponding value of $l$ = 30.\n\nThe total number of cubes in the larger block is $l \\times m \\times (m+1)$.\n\n$l \\times m \\times (m+1)$ = $30 \\times 6 \\times 7$\n$l \\times m \\times (m+1)$ = $2100$\nSo, the smallest possible value of $N$ is $2100$."
