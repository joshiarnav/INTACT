    "problem": "Find the least odd prime factor of $2019^8+1$.\n",
    "solution": "We know that $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ for some prime $p$. We want to find the smallest odd possible value of $p$. By squaring both sides of the congruence, we find $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is a positive divisor of $16$.\nHowever, if the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $1, 2, 4,$ or $8,$ then $2019^8$ will be equivalent to $1 \\pmod{p},$ which contradicts the given requirement that $2019^8\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$.\nTherefore, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $16$. Because all orders modulo $p$ divide $\\phi(p)$, we see that $\\phi(p)$ is a multiple of $16$. As $p$ is prime, $\\phi(p) = p\\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{p}\\right) = p - 1$. Therefore, $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$. The two smallest primes equivalent to $1 \\pmod{16}$ are $17$ and $97$. As $2019^8 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$ and $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{97}$, the smallest possible $p$ is thus $\\boxed{97}$.",

    "model_solution": "We can use modular arithmetic properties to find the prime factor. \n\nGiven $2019^8 + 1$. We know that $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ for some prime number $p$. \n\nSince $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$, we know that $(2019^4)^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$. Thus $2019^4 \\equiv \\pm i \\pmod{p}$ and hence $2019^8 \\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nIf $2019^8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, then we can divide both sides by a large power of $p$ (We can find the lowest power of $p$ that divides $2019^8$ using Fermat's little theorem or a similar method. Since $p$ is a prime factor of $2019^8+1$, $p$ must be at least 3). \n\nHowever, this still does not give us an odd prime. \n\nSo, we consider the case where $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nIf we square both sides, we have $(2019^8)^2 \\equiv (-1)^2 \\pmod{p}$, which gives $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\n$2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, this is true for all values of $n$ such that $p-1$ divides $16$. \n\nThe $p-1$ is divisible by 16 if and only if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$.\n\nWe find the smallest odd prime number that satisfies this congruence, which is 17.\n\nWe check whether $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$, and indeed we find this to be the case, as $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$ and $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{17}$.\n\nWe know that $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{17}$ and we also know that $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$.\n\nThis tells us that the order of $2019 \\pmod{17}$ is 16. \n\nSince the order of a number modulo $p$ divides $p-1$, we know that the order of $2019 \\pmod{17}$ divides $16$.\n\nSince the order of $2019 \\pmod{17}$ is 16, we know that the order of $2019 \\pmod{17}$ is not less than 16.\n\nSince the only possible orders of $2019 \\pmod{17}$ are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16, we know that the order of $2019 \\pmod{17}$ is exactly 16.\n\nWe know that the order of $2019 \\pmod{p}$ is $8k$ for some positive integer $k$ if and only if $2019^8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. \n\nWe know that the order of $2019 \\pmod{p}$ is $16$ if and only if $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ and $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nTherefore, the order of $2019 \\pmod{p}$ is $16$ if and only if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$ and $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ and $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nFrom the given, we know that the order of $2019 \\pmod{p}$ is 16. \n\nTherefore, we know that $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, and $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nSince we know that $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, we know that every multiple of 16 is congruent to 1 modulo $p$ and hence every multiple of 16 is a congruent to 1 modulo $p$.\n\nSince $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, we know that $2019$ is a congruent to $1 \\pmod{p}$, since $2019$ is a multiple of 16.\n\nWe know that $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nWe know that $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ and $2019$ is a congruent to $1 \\pmod{p}$. \n\nThis tells us that the square of $2019$ is a congruent to $-1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nWe know that $2019^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nWe know that $2019^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ and $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nThis tells us that $2019^{18} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nWe know that $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ and $2019^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nWe know that $2019^{18} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nWe know that $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nThis tells us that $2019^{18} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ since $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ and $2019^{18} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nWe know that $2019^{18} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nWe know that $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nThis tells us that $2019^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ since $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ and $2019^{18} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nHowever, we know that $2019^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nWe know that $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ and $2019^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, $p = 17$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest odd prime number that is a factor of $2019^8 + 1$ is 17."
