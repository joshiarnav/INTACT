    "problem": "What is the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3?",
    "solution": "The first odd multiple of 3 is 3. The next is 9, then 15, 21, adding 6 each time. The $n$th odd multiple of 3 is $6n-3$; the 10th odd multiple of 3 is therefore $60-3=\\boxed{57}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3, we need to find the pattern. \n\nOdd multiples of 3 are 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, etc. \n\nSince we are looking for the tenth positive integer, we count: 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57.\n\nTherefore, the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is 57."
