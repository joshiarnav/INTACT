    "problem": "Find the units digit of $n$ given that $mn = 21^6$ and $m$ has a units digit of 7.",
    "solution": "The units digit of $mn$ is $1^6 = 1$.  Searching for a units digit for $n$ (which is clearly odd), we find that $7 \\cdot 3 = 1$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit of $n$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the units digit of n, we need to find the units digit of 21^6 and then divide it by the units digit of m, which is 7.\n\nThe units digit of 21 is 1. The units digit of 1 raised to any power is still 1. \n\nHowever, we have 21^6. Since the units digit of 21 is 1, the units digit of 21^6 will also be 1.\n\nNow we need to divide 1 by 7. The units digit of 7 is 7, and 1 divided by 7 has a units digit of 1, because 1 has no remainder when divided by 7.\n\nSo the units digit of n is 1."
