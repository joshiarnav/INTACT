    "problem": "Kaleb defined a $\\emph{clever integer}$ as an even integer that is greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9. What fraction of all clever integers is divisible by 27? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "You can easily list out the numbers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add to 9: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.\n\nTo be a $\\emph{clever integer}$ the number must be even, which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, a total of 5 numbers.\n\nThe problem asks which fraction of these five clever integers are divisible by 27. Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the clever integers that are divisible by 27, first consider the range of possible numbers. The numbers are integers greater than 20, less than 120, and even. \n\nThe possible numbers are: 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118.\n\nNow, you need to find the sum of the digits of each of these numbers and find which are even and greater than 20 and less than 120 and sum to 9.\n\nThe numbers are: \n\n* 27 is not in the list\n* 36\n* 45 is not in the list\n* 54\n* 63 is not in the list\n* 72\n* 81 is not in the list\n* 90\n* 99 is not in the list\n\nThe numbers that are even and sum to 9 are 36, 54, 72, 90.\n\nThe numbers that are divisible by 27 are 54 and 90.\n\nThere are 4 clever integers and 2 of them are divisible by 27, so the fraction is 2/4 which can be simplified to 1/2."
