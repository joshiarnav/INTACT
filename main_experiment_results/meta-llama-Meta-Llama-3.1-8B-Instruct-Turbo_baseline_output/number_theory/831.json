    "problem": "Let $S = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + \\cdots + 2009 - 2010$. What is the residue of $S$, modulo 2010?",
    "solution": "Note that $x + 2010 \\equiv x \\pmod{2010}$. Add 2010 to every negative summand and rearrange the terms to find $S \\equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 2008 + 2009 \\pmod{2010}$. The right-hand side is the sum of the integers from 1 to 2010, so $S \\equiv \\frac{2010 \\cdot 2011}{2} \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 2011 \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 1 \\equiv \\boxed{1005} \\pmod{2010}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the residue of S, modulo 2010, we need to calculate the sum S first. The given sum can be expressed as the difference of two arithmetic series:\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series with 'n' terms, first term 'a', and last term 'l' can be given by the formula $\\frac {n(a+l)}2$\n\nHere, 'n' is the number of terms, which is 2010 in this case.\n\nLet the sum be S = (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + (7 - 8) + ... + (2009 - 2010)\n\nWe can pair consecutive terms as follows:\n\nThe sum of all these pairs is equal to the sum of the first and the last terms in each pair.\n\nThere are 1005 such pairs because 2010 is an even number.\n\nNow we can rewrite S as follows:\nS = (1 - 2010) + (3 - 2009) + ... + (2007 - 3) + (2009 - 1) \n\nNow let's simplify the above equation by adding the numbers inside the parentheses:\n\nThe equation becomes S = -2009 + (-2007) + ... + (-3) + (-1)\n\nNow, we can see that all the terms in the equation are negative, so we can write the equation as S = -(2009 + 2007 + ... + 3 + 1)\n\nNow let's use the formula of the sum of arithmetic series on the above equation. Here, 'n' is equal to 1005. The first term (a) is equal to 1 and the last term (l) is equal to 2010\n\nSo, we can write the equation as S = - (1005 * (1 + 2010) / 2)\n\nNow, we can simplify the above equation. \nSo, we can write the equation as S = - (1005 * 2011) / 2\n\nNow, we can simplify the above equation further. \nSo, we can write the equation as S = - 1005 * 1005.5 \n\nNow, we can simplify the above equation further. \nSo, we can write the equation as S = - 1,014,302.5\n\nFinally, we can simplify the above equation further. \nSo, we can write the equation as S = - 1,014,302 \n\nNow let's take the residue modulo 2010 of the above equation. We have:\nS = - 1,014,302 mod 2010\n\nNow, let's simplify the above equation by dividing - 1,014,302 by 2010. We get - 1,014,302 / 2010 = - 505.1515\n\nThe residue of - 505.1515 is - 505 mod 2010.\n\nWe can simplify the above equation further. \nWe can write the equation as S = - 505 mod 2010.\n\nWe can simplify the above equation further. \nWe can write the equation as S = 2010 - 505.\n\nWe can simplify the above equation further. \nWe can write the equation as S = 1505.\n\nTherefore, the residue of S, modulo 2010, is 1505."
