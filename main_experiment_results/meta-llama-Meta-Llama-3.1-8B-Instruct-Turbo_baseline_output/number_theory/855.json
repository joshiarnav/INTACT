    "problem": "What is $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\pmod{25}$? Express your answer as an integer from $0$ to $24$, inclusive.",
    "solution": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 3 and 9 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 13 + \\frac 19 \\equiv \\frac{9 + 3}{27} \\equiv \\frac{12}{2} \\equiv \\boxed{6} \\pmod{25}.$$We can justify this as follows: let $a \\equiv 3^{-1} \\pmod{25}$ and $b \\equiv 9^{-1} \\pmod{25}$. Then $27a \\equiv 9 \\pmod{25}$ and $27b \\equiv 3 \\pmod{25}$. Summing these congruences shows that $27(a+b) \\equiv 2(a+b) \\equiv 9 + 3 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{25}$, so $a+b \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}$, as desired.",

    "model_solution": "To calculate $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\pmod{25}$, we first need to find the modular inverses of $3$ and $9$ modulo $25$. \n\nTo find the modular inverse of $3$ modulo $25$, we need to find a number $x$ such that $3x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$. \n\nWe can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse:\n\n25 = 8 * 3 + 1\n3 = 3 * 1 + 0\n\nWorking backwards, we can express 1 as a linear combination of 25 and 3:\n1 = 25 - 8 * 3\n\nTherefore, the modular inverse of 3 modulo 25 is -8, which is equivalent to 17 modulo 25.\n\nNow, to find the modular inverse of 9 modulo 25, we can use the fact that $9 \\equiv -16 \\pmod{25}$. Since $-16 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{25}$, we can use the property of modular arithmetic that $(-a) \\equiv 25 - a \\pmod{m}$.\n\nThe modular inverse of -16 modulo 25 is 16, which is equivalent to 16 modulo 25.\n\nHowever, we can simply reduce 9 to -16 and use that to find its inverse. \n\n9 = -16 and 16 is its inverse.\n\nTherefore, $9^{-1} \\equiv 16 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nNow we can calculate $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\pmod{25}$:\n\n$3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\equiv 17 + 16 \\pmod{25}$\n\n$3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\equiv 33 \\pmod{25}$\n\nTo reduce 33 modulo 25, we can simply take the remainder when 33 is divided by 25:\n\n$3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\equiv 8 \\pmod{25}$\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8."
