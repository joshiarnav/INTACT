    "problem": "For some positive integer $k$, when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. What is the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$?",
    "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "Given that 60 divided by $k^2$ has a remainder of 6, we can express this as an equation:\n\n60 = $q \\cdot k^2$ + 6\n\nwhere $q$ is the quotient. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\n54 = $q \\cdot k^2$\n\nSince 54 is divisible by $k^2$, we need to find the factors of 54 to determine possible values of $k$.\n\nThe factors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54.\n\nHowever, if $k^2$ is 1, then $k$ would be 1, but this would result in a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by $k^2$.  Only 1 squared is 1.\n\nWe should also note that $k^2$ cannot be 54 because $k$ would be greater than or equal to 8.54, which means that 100 divided by $k$ would not be an integer.  We should also note $k^2$ cannot be 27 because 100 divided by $k$ would not be an integer.\n\nWe should also consider $k^2$ as 18 or 9.  If $k^2$ is 18, $k$ would be around 4.24.  If $k^2$ is 9,  $k$ would be 3.\n\nWe should test these values of $k$ by dividing 100 by them to see if we can find a remainder.\n\nIf $k$ is 1, 100 divided by 1 has a remainder of 0.\n\nIf $k$ is 3, 100 divided by 3 has a remainder of 1.\n\nIf $k$ is not an integer, then 100 divided by $k$ will not be an integer."
