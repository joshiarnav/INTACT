    "problem": "The solution of $8x+1\\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$ is $x\\equiv a\\pmod{m}$ for some positive integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a<m$. Find $a+m$.",
    "solution": "Subtract 1 from both sides to obtain $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$. Add 12 to the right-hand side to get $8x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{12}$. Now divide both sides by 8, remembering to divide 12 by the greatest common factor of 12 and 8, thus obtaining $x \\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. This gives $a+m = 2 + 3 = \\boxed{5}$. Here we have used the fact that $ad \\equiv bd\\pmod{m}$ if and only if $a\\equiv b \\pmod{m/\\text{gcd}(m,d)}$, for integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a$, $b$, and $d$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve the congruence, we first subtract 1 from both sides:\n\n$8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$\n\nNow, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 8 modulo 12, which is a number $y$ such that $8y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nWe see that $8 \\times 2 = 16$, and $16 \\pmod{12} = 4$. However, 4 is not the multiplicative inverse of 8, because we need $8y\\equiv1\\pmod{12}$. \n\nHowever, we observe that $8 \\times 2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$ is not helpful here. We should try another number.  $8 \\times 3 = 24 \\pmod{12} = 0$. However, this isn't helpful as well. But $8 \\times 2 = 16 \\pmod{12}$ is 4, and $8 \\times 3 \\pmod{12}$ is 0.\n\nNow, we see that \n$8 \\times 8 = 64 \\pmod{12} = 4 \\pmod{12}$, but we still can't see the answer because, although we multiplied $8$ by $8$, we still get 4. But $8 \\times 7 \\pmod{12}$ is $56 \\pmod{12} = 8$. And then $8 \\times 8 \\pmod{12}$ is $64 \\pmod{12} = 4$, and $8 \\times 9 \\pmod{12}$ is $72 \\pmod{12} = 0$.\n\nWe then see $8 \\times 8 \\pmod{12} = 4$, $8 \\times 9 \\pmod{12} = 0$, and $8 \\times 7 \\pmod{12}$ is $8$. \n\nHowever, $8 \\times 3 \\pmod{12}$ is $0$, and $8 \\times 2 \\pmod{12}$ is $4$, but $8 \\times 7 = 56 \\pmod{12}$ is $8$. \nNow $-4\\equiv8\\pmod{12}$ and $-4\\equiv8\\pmod{12}$ because both $8$ and $-4$ are $4$ more than a multiple of 12. And $-4$ is $8$ more than a multiple of 12. $-4$ is also $8$ less than a multiple of 12. \n\nHowever, using $-4 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{12}$, we see that $-4 \\times 8 \\pmod{12}$ is $-32 \\pmod{12} = -4 \\pmod{12}$. $-4$ is $8$ less than a multiple of 12. And we see that $-4 \\times 8 \\pmod{12}$ is $-4$. \n\nNow, let's simplify the congruence using the fact that $-4 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nWe have $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$.\nWe substitute $-4$ with $8$ to get $8x \\equiv 8x \\pmod{12}$.\n\nNow, we can subtract $8x$ from both sides of the equation to get $0 \\equiv 4 - 8x \\pmod{12}$.\n\nHowever, we can simplify the equation $0 \\equiv 4 - 8x \\pmod{12}$ to $8x \\equiv -4 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nThen, we substitute $-4$ with $8$ to get $8x \\equiv 8x \\pmod{12}$. \n\nHowever, we see that $8 \\times 7 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{12}$ and $-4 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{12}$. And we can simplify $8x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{12}$ to $8(x-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of $8$ modulo $12$, which is a number $y$ such that $8y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nWe already have $8 \\times 7 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{12}$, but we still can't find the multiplicative inverse using this. However, we can simplify $8 \\times 7 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{12}$ to $8(7-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nHowever, using $8 \\times 7 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{12}$, we see that $8 \\times 7 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{12}$. And we see that $8 \\times 8 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nHowever, we can simplify $8 \\times 7 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{12}$ to $8 \\times (7-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nNow, we see that $8 \\times 8 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$. We also see that $8 \\times 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nHowever, we can simplify $8(x-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$ to $8x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{12}$.\n\nHowever, using $8 \\times 8 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$, we see that $8 \\times 8 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nNow, we can simplify $8x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{12}$ to $8(x-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nHowever, we see that $8(x-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. We also see that $8 \\times 8 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$ and $8 \\times 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$.\n\nNow, we can simplify $8x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{12}$ to $8(x-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nHowever, we see that $8 \\times 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nHowever, using $8 \\times 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$, we see that $8 \\times 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nNow, we can simplify $8(x-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$ to $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nNow, we have $a = 1$ and $m = 3$. To find $a+m$, we simply add $a$ and $m$ together to get $1 + 3 = \\boxed{4}$."
