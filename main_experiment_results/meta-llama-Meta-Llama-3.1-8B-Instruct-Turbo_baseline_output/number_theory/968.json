    "problem": "Three different natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors. How many factors does $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ have?",
    "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",

    "model_solution": "If a natural number has exactly three factors, then it is the square of a prime number. Let $x = a^2$, $y = b^2$, and $z = c^2$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are primes. \n\nThen, $x^2y^3z^4 = (a^2)^2(b^2)^3(c^2)^4 = a^4b^6c^8$.\n\nThe number of factors of a number $N = p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}...p_m^{n_m}$ is given by $(n_1 + 1)(n_2 + 1)...(n_m + 1)$.\n\nTherefore, the number of factors of $x^2y^3z^4$ is $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1) = 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 9 = 315$."
