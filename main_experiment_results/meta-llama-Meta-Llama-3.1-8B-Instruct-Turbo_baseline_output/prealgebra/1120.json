    "model_solution": "To find the area of the shaded $\\text L$-shaped region, we need to break it down into simpler shapes. \n\nFirst, let's find the area of the larger square. The side length of the larger square is 4 units (4 units - 1 unit - 1 unit = 2 units, 1 unit + 3 units = 4 units). Since the area of a square is calculated by squaring the side length, the area of the larger square is $4^2 = 16$ square units.\n\nNext, let's find the areas of the two smaller squares. One square has a side length of 3 units, and the other square has a side length of 1 unit. So, the areas of the two smaller squares are $3^2 = 9$ square units and $1^2 = 1$ square unit, respectively.\n\nNow, we can find the area of the shaded $\\text L$-shaped region by subtracting the combined area of the two smaller squares from the area of the larger square. However, we need to add the area of the one unit square not overlapped by the L-shaped area. \n\nThe area of the shaded $\\text L$-shaped region is $16 - (9 + 1) + 1$ = $16 - 9 = 7$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{7}$."
