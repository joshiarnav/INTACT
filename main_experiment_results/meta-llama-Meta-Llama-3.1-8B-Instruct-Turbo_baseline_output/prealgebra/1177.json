    "problem": "In a right triangle with integer length sides, the hypotenuse has length 39 units. How many units is the length of the shorter leg?",
    "solution": "Since they only ask for one length, you can assume that there's only one possible triangle.  Then, quickly note that $39 = 3\\cdot 13$, and that 5 - 12 - 13 is a Pythagorean triple.  Therefore, the shorter leg has length $\\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the length of the shorter leg, we need to find two integers that, when squared and added together, equal 39^2. \n\n39^2 = 1521\n\nNow we need to find two integers a and b such that:\n\na^2 + b^2 = 1521\n\nLet's check some Pythagorean triples. We know that 9-36-39 is a Pythagorean triple. So, a = 9 and b = 36.\n\nTherefore, the shorter leg of the right triangle has a length of 9 units."
