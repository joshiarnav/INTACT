    "model_solution": "To find the percentage of x that is equal to 40% of 50% of x, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. 50% of x is calculated as 0.5x\n2. 40% of 0.5x is calculated as 0.4 * 0.5x = 0.2x\n3. We want to find the percentage of x that equals 0.2x. Let's assume this percentage is 'p'. Then the equation becomes:\n   (p/100) * x = 0.2x\n\nTo find 'p', we can rearrange the equation by dividing both sides by x:\np/100 = 0.2\nMultiply both sides by 100 to solve for 'p':\np = 20\n\nTherefore, 20% of x is equal to 40% of 50% of x."
