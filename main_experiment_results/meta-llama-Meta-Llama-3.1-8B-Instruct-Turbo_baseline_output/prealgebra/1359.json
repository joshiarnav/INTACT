    "solution": "To find the least common multiple of the positive integers less than or equal to 8, we prime factorize each of them. \\begin{align*}\n2 &= 2 \\\\\n3 &= 3 \\\\\n4 &= 2^2 \\\\\n5 &= 5 \\\\\n6 &= 2\\cdot 3 \\\\\n7 &= 7 \\\\\n8 &= 2^3.\n\\end{align*} Taking the maximum exponent for each prime, we find a least common multiple of $2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7=(2\\cdot5)\\cdot 2^2\\cdot3\\cdot7=10\\cdot84=\\boxed{840}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least positive integer divisible by each of the first eight positive integers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.\n\nBreaking down the numbers into their prime factors, we get:\n- 1 (no prime factors)\n- 2\n- 3\n- 4 = 2^2\n- 5\n- 6 = 2 * 3\n- 7\n- 8 = 2^3\n\nTo find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in the numbers:\n- 2^3 (from 8)\n- 3^1 (from 3 and 6)\n- 5^1 (from 5)\n- 7^1 (from 7)\n\nMultiplying these together, we get:\nLCM = 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^1 * 7^1\n= 8 * 3 * 5 * 7\n= 840\n\nSo, the least positive integer divisible by each of the first eight positive integers is 840."
