    "model_solution": "To express the given expression as a common fraction, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):\n\n1. Evaluate the expressions in the numerator and denominator separately:\n   - Numerator: $\\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{3}{4}$\n   - Denominator: $\\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n2. To add the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their denominators:\n   - LCM of 5 and 4 is 20\n   - LCM of 9 and 6 is 18\n\n3. Rewrite the fractions with the LCM as the denominator:\n   - Numerator: $\\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{4}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{5}{5} = \\frac{8}{20} + \\frac{15}{20} = \\frac{23}{20}$\n   - Denominator: $\\frac{4}{9} \\cdot \\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{8}{18} + \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{11}{18}$\n\n4. Now that we have the numerator and denominator as fractions, we can rewrite the original expression:\n   $\\cfrac{ \\frac{23}{20} }{ \\frac{11}{18} }$\n\n5. To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal:\n   $\\frac{23}{20} \\cdot \\frac{18}{11}$\n\n6. Multiply the numerators and denominators:\n   $\\frac{23 \\cdot 18}{20 \\cdot 11}$\n\n7. Simplify the expression by cancelling out common factors:\n   $\\frac{23 \\cdot 9}{10 \\cdot 11}$\n\n8. Since 9 and 11 do not have any common factors (other than 1), and 10 and 23 do not have any common factors (other than 1), the fraction cannot be simplified further.\n\nThe resulting fraction is:\n$\\frac{207}{110}$"
