    "problem": "How many integers between 1 and 200 are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7?",
    "solution": "Integers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 must be multiples of 15.  We can start by listing the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200: $$15,30,45,60,75,90,105,120,135,150,165,180,195$$ Checking only the even numbers, we can eliminate those that are multiples of 4, leaving us with: $$15,30,45,75,90,105,135,150,165,195$$ Finally, we need to eliminate any remaining multiples of 7.  The only multiples of 7 we need to be concerned with are those ending in 5 or 0.  The only number on the list that is a multiple of 7 is 105.  Our final list is: $$15,30,45,75,90,135,150,165,195$$ This leaves us with $\\boxed{9}$ integers.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of integers between 1 and 200 that are multiples of both 3 and 5, and then subtract the ones that are multiples of either 4 or 7.\n\nFirst, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5, which is 15. This is because 15 is the smallest number that can be divided by both 3 and 5.\n\nNow, let's count the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200:\n15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165, 180, and 195. There are 13 multiples.\n\nNext, let's count the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 4 (60, 120, 180). There are 3 multiples that need to be subtracted.\n\nAlso, let's count the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 7 (105). There is 1 multiple that needs to be subtracted.\n\nNow, let's subtract the multiples of 4 and 7 from the multiples of 15:\n13 (multiples of 15) - 3 (multiples of both 15 and 4) - 1 (multiple of both 15 and 7) = 9.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 integers between 1 and 200 that are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7."
