    "problem": "A 12-slice pizza was made with only pepperoni and mushroom toppings, and every slice has at least one topping. Only six slices have pepperoni, and exactly ten slices have mushrooms. How many slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms?",
    "solution": "There are 12 total slices, and 6 of them have pepperoni and 10 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number of the slices that have both toppings, so there are $6-n$ with just pepperoni and $10-n$ with just mushrooms.  Since every slice has at least one topping, and there are 12 slices, we must have $(6-n) + (10-n) + n = 12$, which gives $n=\\boxed{4}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of slices that have both pepperoni and mushrooms, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet's denote the total number of slices as T = 12, the number of slices with pepperoni as P = 6, and the number of slices with mushrooms as M = 10.\n\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion states that the total number of slices with either pepperoni or mushrooms (or both) can be calculated as:\n\nT = P + M - (number of slices with both)\n\nSince every slice has at least one topping, the total number of slices with either pepperoni or mushrooms (or both) is equal to the total number of slices, which is 12.\n\nNow we can solve for the number of slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms:\n\n12 = 6 + 10 - (number of slices with both)\n12 = 16 - (number of slices with both)\n(number of slices with both) = 16 - 12\n(number of slices with both) = 4\n\nTherefore, there are 4 slices that have both pepperoni and mushrooms."
