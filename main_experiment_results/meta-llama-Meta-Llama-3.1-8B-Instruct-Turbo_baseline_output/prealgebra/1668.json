    "solution": "The chart shows the amounts of sales at the end of each year.  Therefore we're looking for a year on the chart that has the largest difference from the previous year.    Determining the sales that increased the most number of dollars is equivalent to finding the right endpoint of the segment with the steepest slope.  From observation, we can determine that that line corresponds to the year $\\boxed{1998}$.",

    "model_solution": "To determine the year with the greatest increase in sales, we need to examine the increases between consecutive years. \n\n- The increase from 1996 to 1998 is $0.25-0.2=0.05$ million dollars.\n- The increase from 1998 to 2000 is $0.4-0.325=0.075$ million dollars.\n- The increase from 2000 to 2002 is $0.475-0.45=0.025$ million dollars.\n\nThe greatest increase is 0.075 million dollars. This occurred between 1998 and 2000.  Therefore, the year in which sales increased the most was 1998."
