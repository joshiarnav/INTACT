    "problem": "Given three members of a group -- Alice, Bob, and Carol -- in how many ways can these three be chosen to be the three officers (president, secretary, and treasurer) of the group, assuming no person holds more than one job?",
    "solution": "In this problem we are choosing a committee, so the order in which we choose the 3 people does not matter.  We could have chosen them in any of the following orders (where A is Alice, B is Bob, and C is Carol): ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.  So each possible committee corresponds to $3! = \\boxed{6}$ possible orderings.",

    "model_solution": "To choose the three officers, we need to select a president, then a secretary, and finally a treasurer. \n\nFor the position of president, we have 3 choices (Alice, Bob, or Carol). \n\nAfter choosing the president, we have 2 choices left for the position of secretary. \n\nFinally, for the position of treasurer, we have 1 choice left. \n\nUsing the fundamental counting principle, the total number of ways to choose the three officers is:\n\n3 (choices for president) * 2 (choices for secretary) * 1 (choice for treasurer) = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 ways to choose the three officers from Alice, Bob, and Carol."
