    "model_solution": "The area of a square is equal to the square of its side length. Since angle $EAB$ is a right angle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the lengths of $AB$ and $AE$. Let $AB = x$ and $AE = y$. Then $x^2 + y^2 = 9^2$, and the sum of the areas of the two squares is $x^2 + y^2$.\n\nSince $x^2 + y^2 = 9^2$, the sum of the areas of the two squares is $9^2$, or 81 square units."
