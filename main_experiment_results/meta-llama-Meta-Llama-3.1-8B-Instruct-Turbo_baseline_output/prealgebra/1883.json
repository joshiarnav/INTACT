    "problem": "In order to compute the area of a particular circle, Juan first measures the length of its diameter. The actual diameter is 20 cm, but Juan's measurement has an error of up to $20\\%$. What is the largest possible percent error, in percent, in Juan's computed area of the circle?",
    "solution": "Juan can measure the diameter as a length anywhere between $20 - 20\\cdot 0.2 = 16$ and $20 + 20\\cdot 0.2 = 24$  cm. The actual area of the circle is $\\pi (20/2)^2=100\\pi$ square cm, but Juan can compute the area anywhere in the range $\\pi (16/2)^2=64 \\pi$ square cm to $\\pi (24/2)^2=144 \\pi$ square cm. Using the lower bound of the range, Juan's error is $(100\\pi - 64\\pi)/(100\\pi)=36\\%$. Using the upper bound of the range, Juan's error is $(144\\pi - 100\\pi)/(100\\pi)=44\\%$. Thus, the largest possible percent error is $\\boxed{44}$ percent.",

    "model_solution": "To find the percent error in Juan's computation, we need to find the true area of the circle and Juan's computed area.\n\nThe true area of the circle is given by:\n\\[ A = \\pi r^2 \\]\nwhere $r$ is the radius. Since the diameter is 20 cm, the radius is 10 cm.\n\\[ A = \\pi (10)^2 = 100\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\]\n\nHowever, Juan's measurement has an error of up to $20\\%$. This means that his measurement of the diameter can be up to $20\\%$ larger or smaller than the true diameter. To find the largest possible percent error, we need to consider the case where Juan's measurement is $20\\%$ larger than the true diameter.\n\nIf Juan's measurement of the diameter is $20\\%$ larger than the true diameter, then his measurement is:\n\\[ (1 + 0.20) \\times 20 = 24 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\nThis is the diameter that Juan will use to compute the area of the circle.\n\nThe radius of the circle with this diameter is:\n\\[ r = \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\nThe area of the circle with this diameter is:\n\\[ A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (12)^2 = 144\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the percent error in Juan's computation by comparing the true area with Juan's computed area.\n\nThe percent error is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Percent Error} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Computed Area} - \\text{True Area}}{\\text{True Area}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Percent Error} = \\left( \\frac{144\\pi - 100\\pi}{100\\pi} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{44\\pi}{100\\pi} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 44\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the largest possible percent error, in percent, in Juan's computed area of the circle is $44\\%$."
