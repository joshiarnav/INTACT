    "solution": "Since the arithmetic mean of these expressions is 24, we can write the expression for the mean: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{(x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)}{5}&=24\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad (x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)&=5\\cdot 24\n\\end{align*}\n\nCombining like terms on the left, we find $5x+40=120$, so $5x=80$, from which we have $x=16$. Our final answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $x$, we need to first calculate the arithmetic mean of the given expressions. The arithmetic mean is calculated by adding all the expressions and then dividing by the total number of expressions.\n\nThe given expressions are: \n\n1. $x + 8$\n2. $15$\n3. $2x$\n4. $13$\n5. $2x + 4$\n\nFirst, add all the expressions:\n\n$(x + 8) + 15 + 2x + 13 + (2x + 4)$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$5x + 40$\n\nSince there are 5 expressions, divide the sum by 5:\n\n$\\frac{5x + 40}{5} = 24$\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n$5x + 40 = 120$\n\nSubract 40 from both sides:\n\n$5x = 80$\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n$x = 16$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ is 16."
