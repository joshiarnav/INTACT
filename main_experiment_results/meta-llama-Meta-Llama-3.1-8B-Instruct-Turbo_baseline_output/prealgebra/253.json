    "problem": "If $x^2 = y - 3$ and $x = -5$, then what is the value of $y$?",
    "solution": "Substituting $-5$ for $x$ in the first equation, we have $(-5)^2 = y-3$.  So $25=y-3$. Adding $3$ to both sides, $y=\\boxed{28}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of y, we need to substitute x = -5 into the equation $x^2 = y - 3$.\n\nFirst, we calculate $x^2$:\n$x^2 = (-5)^2 = 25$\n\nThen, we substitute $x^2$ into the equation:\n$25 = y - 3$\n\nNow, we add 3 to both sides of the equation to solve for y:\n$y = 25 + 3 = 28$\n\nTherefore, the value of y is 28."
