    "problem": "What is the greatest common factor of 68 and 92?",
    "solution": "$68=2^2\\cdot17$ and $92=2^2\\cdot23$. The only prime number that these two prime factorizations have in common is the number 2. If a number's prime factorization has a 2 raised to a power greater than 2, it will not be a factor of either of these numbers, so their GCF is $2^2=\\boxed{4}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 68 and 92, we need to list the factors for each number. \n\nThe factors of 68 are: 1, 2, 4, 17, 34, and 68.\nThe factors of 92 are: 1, 2, 4, 23, 46, and 92.\n\nNow, we need to find the common factors between the two numbers. The common factors are 1, 2, and 4.\n\nThe greatest common factor is the largest number among the common factors. In this case, the greatest common factor is 4."
