    "problem": "What is $ 6 \\div 3 - 2 - 8 + 2 \\cdot 8$?",
    "solution": "Recall that multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction. We get \\[\n6 \\div 3 - 2 - 8 + 2 \\cdot 8 = 2 - 2 - 8 + 16.\n\\]We rewrite the subtractions as additions of negations so we can rearrange:  \\begin{align*}\n2 - 2 - 8 + 16 &= 2 + (-2) + (-8) + 16 \\\\\n&= 16 + 2 + (-2) + (-8) \\\\\n&= 18 - (2+8) \\\\\n&= 18-10 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{8}.\n\\end{align*}",
