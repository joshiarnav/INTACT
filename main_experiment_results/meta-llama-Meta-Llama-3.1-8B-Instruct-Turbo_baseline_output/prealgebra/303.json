    "problem": "What is the 20th digit after the decimal point of the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$?",
    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$, and that of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $0.\\overline{3}$. The first has a repeating block of 6 digits and the second has a repeating block of 1 digit, so we believe the repeating block of the sum will have 6 digits and try adding the first 6 digits of each decimal representation.  $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}& & &. &1 & 4 & \\stackrel{1}{2} & 8 & \\stackrel{1}{5} & 7\\\\& +& &. &3 &3 & 3 & 3& 3 & 3\\\\ \\cline{1-9} & & & .& 4 &7 & 6 & 1 & 9 & 0\\\\ \\end{array} $$ Notice that continuing the addition past the first six digits will result in repeating blocks of the same six digits ($.142857+.333333=.476190$), so the decimal representation of the sum is $0.\\overline{476190}$. Since 20 divided by 6 has a remainder of 2, the 20th digit following the decimal point is the same as the second digit following the decimal point, which is $\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, we first need to convert these fractions to decimals. \n\n$\\frac{1}{3}$ is equal to $0.\\overline{3}$ and $\\frac{1}{7}$ is equal to $0.\\overline{142857}$.\n\nThe repeating pattern of digits in the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ has a length of 6. To find the sum of the decimal equivalents, we need to find a number between 1 and 6 that $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{1}{7}$ have in common after the decimal point.\n\nSince $\\frac{1}{3}$ does not have a repeating pattern of digits after the decimal point, we will add the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ directly.\n\nLet's add the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{1}{7}$.\n\nWe can rewrite $0.\\overline{3}$ as $0.3 + 0.03 + 0.003 + ...$.\n\nThis is an infinite geometric series, with first term $0.3$ and common ratio $\\frac{1}{10}$. \n\nThe sum of the infinite geometric series is $\\frac{a}{1-r}$, where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio. \n\nThus, the sum of the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $\\frac{0.3}{1-\\frac{1}{10}}$. \n\nBy simplifying, we get $\\frac{0.3}{\\frac{9}{10}} = \\frac{3}{10}$. \n\nNow we can add $\\frac{3}{10}$ and the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$.\n\n$\\frac{3}{10} = 0.3$ and this is the same as the first digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$.\n\nTherefore, we can rewrite $0.\\overline{142857}$ as $0.3 + 0.\\overline{142857}$.\n\nWhen we add $0.3 + 0.\\overline{142857}$, the sum is $0.3 + 0.\\overline{142857} + 0.03 + 0.0003 + ...$.\n\nNow we can use the same infinite geometric series to find the sum of the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$.\n\nThe sum of the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $\\frac{0.3 + 0.\\overline{142857}}{1-\\frac{1}{10}} = \\frac{0.3 + 0.\\overline{142857}}{\\frac{9}{10}} = \\frac{0.3 + 0.\\overline{142857}}{\\frac{9}{10}} = \\frac{0.3}{\\frac{9}{10}} + \\frac{0.142857}{\\frac{9}{10}}$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.3 + 0.0158 = 0.3158$.\n\nHowever, to get the sum of $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ we can use a method that will give us the decimal form of the sum directly, without finding the number after the decimal point in the decimal form of $\\frac{1}{7}$.\n\nWe can use long division to find the decimal representation of the sum of $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nBy using a calculator for the sum of the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, we get $0.\\overline{047619}$.\n\nWe need to find the 20th digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of the sum of $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. \n\nThe repeating pattern of digits in the decimal representation of the sum of $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ has a length of 6.\n\nSince the position of the digit we are looking for is 20, we need to find the remainder when 20 is divided by 6, which is 2.\n\nTherefore, the digit we are looking for is the 2nd position in the repeating pattern of digits in the decimal representation of the sum of $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe 2nd position in the repeating pattern of digits in the decimal representation of the sum of $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ is the same as the 2nd position in the repeating pattern of digits in the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$, which is 4.\n\nThe answer to the problem is 4."
