    "model_solution": "To find the percentage of sales that were not pens or pencils, we first need to find the percentage of sales that were pens or pencils. Since the total percentage of sales must add up to 100%, we can subtract the percentage of sales for pens and pencils from 100%.\n\nPercentage of sales that were pens or pencils = \nPens + Pencils = 38 + 35 = 73%\n\nNow, we can subtract this from 100% to find the percentage of sales that were not pens or pencils.\n\nPercentage of sales that were not pens or pencils = 100% - 73% = 27%\n\nSo, 27% of the sales were not pens or pencils."
