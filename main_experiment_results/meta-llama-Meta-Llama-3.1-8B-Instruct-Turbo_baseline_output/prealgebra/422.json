    "problem": "What is the number of square meters in the area of a circle with diameter 4 meters? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "A circle's radius is half its diameter, so if the diameter of a circle is 4 meters, then its radius is 2 meters.  The area of the circle is $\\pi(\\text{radius})^2=\\pi(2\\text{ m})^2=\\boxed{4\\pi}$ square meters.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the circle, we first need to find the radius. Since the diameter is given as 4 meters, the radius is half of that, which is 2 meters.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is given by:\n\nArea = $\\pi$ * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius.\n\nSubstituting the value of the radius into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = $\\pi$ * (2)^2\n= $\\pi$ * 4\n= 4$\\pi$\n\nSo, the area of the circle is 4$\\pi$ square meters."
