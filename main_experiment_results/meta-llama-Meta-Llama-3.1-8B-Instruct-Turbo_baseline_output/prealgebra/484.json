    "problem": "A teacher has a class with $24$ students in it. If she wants to split the students into equal groups of at most $10$ students each, what is the least number of groups that she needs?",
    "solution": "For the teacher to be able to split her students into $x$ groups of $y$ students each, $y$ must be a divisor of $24$. Since we want to create as few groups as possible, we need to maximize the number of students in each group. Thus, $y$ should be the greatest divisor of $24$ that is less than or equal to $10$. This means that $y=8$ and $x=3$. The teacher can create $\\boxed{3}$ groups of $8$ students each.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least number of groups, we need to divide the total number of students (24) by the maximum number of students per group (10). \n\n24 \u00f7 10 = 2.4 \n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This is because we can't have a partial group.\n\nSo, the least number of groups the teacher needs is 3."
