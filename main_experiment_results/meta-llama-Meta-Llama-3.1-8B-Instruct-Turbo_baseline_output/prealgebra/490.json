    "problem": "The circular region of the sign (below, left) has an area of 154 square inches. Vanessa would like to place a tiny ribbon (shaded) around the circle's edge. To be sure she has enough ribbon, she decides to buy 2 inches more of the ribbon than the original circle's circumference. How many inches of ribbon will Vanessa need to buy if she estimates $\\pi = \\frac{22}{7}$?\n\n[asy]import graph;\nsize(125,72.5);\npicture p;\ndraw(p,unitsquare);\nfilldraw(p,Circle((.5,.5),.3),white);\nlabel(p,\"Enter\",(.5,.5),ZapfChancery(\"m\",\"n\"));\nadd(p);\nfilldraw(Circle((2,.5),.4),gray(.6));\nadd(shift(1.5*right)*p);\ndraw((1.1,.5)--(1.4,.5),EndArrow(5,25));[/asy]",
    "solution": "Say the radius of the circle is $r$. Then the area of the circle is $\\pi r^2,$ which we estimate to $154=\\frac{22}{7}r^2$. If we multiply both sides by $\\frac{7}{22}$, we get $r^2=49$ or $r=7$. The circle's circumference is $2\\pi r$, which we again estimate to $\\frac{44}{7}r=44$. Vanessa wants two extra inches of ribbon, so she needs to buy $44+2=\\boxed{46}$ inches of ribbon.",

    "model_solution": "Let's denote the radius of the circle as r.\n\nSince the area of the circle is $\\pi r^2$ and it equals 154 square inches, we can use the estimated value for pi, which is $\\frac{22}{7}$, and set up an equation to find the radius.\n\n$\\frac{22}{7} * r^2 = 154$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac{7}{22}$ to isolate $r^2$,\n\n$r^2 = 154 * \\frac{7}{22}$\n\n$r^2 = 49$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides,\n\n$r = 7$\n\nNow that we know the radius, we can calculate the circumference of the circle, which is $2\\pi r$. Again, using the estimated value for pi,\n\n$2 * \\frac{22}{7} * 7 = 2 * 22 = 44$\n\nTo get the length of the ribbon Vanessa needs to buy, we add 2 inches to the circumference.\n\n$44 + 2 = 46$\n\nVanessa will need to buy 46 inches of ribbon."
