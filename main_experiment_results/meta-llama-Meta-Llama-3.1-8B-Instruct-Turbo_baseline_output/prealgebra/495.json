    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to translate it into a mathematical equation. \n\nOne-half of one-seventh of T can be written as (1/2) * (1/7) * T = (1/14) * T.\n\nOne-third of one-fifth of 90 can be written as (1/3) * (1/5) * 90 = (1/15) * 90 = 6.\n\nNow, we can write the equation: (1/14) * T = 6.\n\nTo solve for T, we multiply both sides by 14: T = 6 * 14 = 84.\n\nSo, the value of T is 84."
