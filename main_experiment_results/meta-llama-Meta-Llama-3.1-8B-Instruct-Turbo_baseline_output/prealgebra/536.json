    "problem": "A zoo has a menagerie containing four pairs of different animals, one male and one female for each. The zookeeper wishes to feed the animals in a specific pattern: each time he feeds a single animal, the next one he feeds must be a different gender. If he starts by feeding the male giraffe, how many ways can he feed all the animals?",
    "solution": "If the zookeeper starts with the male giraffe, there are 4 females which he can feed next. Once one is selected, there are 3 males he can feed next, then 3 females, 2 males, 2 females, 1 male, and 1 female.\n\nThe total number of possibilities is $4\\times3\\times3\\times2\\times2 = \\boxed{144}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The zookeeper starts by feeding the male giraffe. This sets the first action.\n2. The next animal must be a female, since the zookeeper just fed a male. There are 4 females to choose from.\n3. The next animal must be a male again, since the last one was a female. There are now 3 males to choose from, because one has already been fed.\n4. The next animal must be a female. There are now 3 females to choose from.\n5. The next animal must be a male. There are now 2 males to choose from.\n6. The next animal must be a female. There are now 2 females to choose from.\n7. The next animal must be a male. There are now 1 male to choose from.\n8. The next animal must be a female. There is only 1 female left to choose from.\n\nTo find the total number of ways the zookeeper can feed the animals, we need to multiply the number of choices at each step:\n\n4 (females for step 2) * 3 (males for step 3) * 3 (females for step 4) * 2 (males for step 5) * 2 (females for step 6) * 1 (male for step 7) * 1 (female for step 8) = 4 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 144\n\nHowever, this is a permutation problem with a constraint that is a property of a permutation with a specific arrangement. This problem can be solved with the formula for permutations of a multiset.\n\nThe formula for permutations of a multiset is: \nn! / (k1! * k2! * ... * km!) where n is the total number of items and k1, k2, etc., are the number of each type of item.\n\nThere are 4 pairs of animals, which makes a total of 8 animals. The zookeeper starts with a male, so we have 4 females and 3 males left after the first step. Applying the formula:\n8! / (4! * 3!) = 40320 / (24 * 6) = 40320 / 144 = 280.\n\nHowever the previous answer was wrong and misunderstood the problem."
