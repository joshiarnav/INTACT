    "problem": "What is the sum of the prime factors of 91?",
    "solution": "Since 91 is not divisible by the first three prime numbers, we try dividing $91\\div 7$.  We find a quotient of 13, so $91=7\\times 13$ and the sum of these prime factors is $7+13=\\boxed{20}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the prime factors of 91, we need to find the prime factors first. \n\nThe prime factorization of 91 is:\n91 = 7 \u00d7 13\n\nNow, we can find the sum of these prime factors:\nSum = 7 + 13\nSum = 20\n\nSo, the sum of the prime factors of 91 is 20."
