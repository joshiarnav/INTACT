    "problem": "The average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $4x-7$. What is $x$?",
    "solution": "The average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $\\dfrac{1}{3}((x+6)+(6x+2)+(2x+7))$. Simplifying this expression gives $\\dfrac{1}{3}(9x+15)=3x+5$. We know the average is also $4x-7$, so $3x+5=4x-7$. Subtracting $3x-7$ from both sides of this equation gives $x=\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $x$, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. The average of three numbers can be found by adding them up and dividing by 3.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n((x+6) + (6x+2) + (2x+7)) / 3 = 4x-7\n\nFirst, let's simplify the left-hand side by adding up the numbers:\n\n(x+6) + (6x+2) + (2x+7) = x + 6x + 2x + 6 + 2 + 7\n= 9x + 15\n\nNow, our equation becomes:\n\n(9x + 15) / 3 = 4x - 7\n\nNext, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n9x + 15 = 12x - 21\n\nNow, let's isolate $x$ by subtracting $9x$ from both sides:\n\n15 = 3x - 21\n\nNext, we can add 21 to both sides:\n\n36 = 3x\n\nNow, let's divide both sides by 3 to solve for $x$:\n\nx = 36 / 3\nx = 12\n\nSo, the value of $x$ is 12."
