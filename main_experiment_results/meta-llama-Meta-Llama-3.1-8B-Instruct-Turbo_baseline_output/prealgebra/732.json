    "problem": "Amanda, Ben, and Carlos share a sum of money. Their portions are in the ratio of 1:2:7, respectively. If Amanda's portion is $\\$$20, what is the total amount of money shared?",
    "solution": "We multiply each part of the ratio $1:2:7$ by 20 to make Amanda's part equal 20, and we have \\[1:2:7 = 1\\cdot 20:2\\cdot 20 :7\\cdot 20 = 20:40:140.\\] This means that  Ben's share is $2\\times 20 = 40$ dollars and Carlos's share is $7\\times 20=140$ dollars.  Therefore, the total amount of money shared is $20+40+140=\\boxed{200}$ dollars.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total amount of money shared, we need to find the sum of the portions of Amanda, Ben, and Carlos. \n\nGiven that Amanda's portion is $\\$$20 and the ratio of their portions is 1:2:7, we can let the portions be $1x, 2x,$ and $7x$ respectively. \n\nSince Amanda's portion is $\\$$20, we have $1x = 20.$ \n\nWe can multiply $x$ by $2$ to find Ben's portion, $2x,$ which is $2 \\times 20 = 40.$ \n\nWe can multiply $x$ by $7$ to find Carlos's portion, $7x,$ which is $7 \\times 20 = 140.$ \n\nNow, we can find the total amount of money shared by adding the portions of Amanda, Ben, and Carlos. \n\nTotal = $1x + 2x + 7x = (1 + 2 + 7)x = 10x$\n\nSince $1x = 20,$ we can multiply $10$ by $20$ to find $10x,$ which is $10 \\times 20 = 200.$ \n\nTherefore, the total amount of money shared is $\\$$200."
