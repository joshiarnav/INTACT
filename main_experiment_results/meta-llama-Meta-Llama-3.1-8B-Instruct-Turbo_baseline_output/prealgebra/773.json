    "problem": "If $x$ is a positive multiple of 8 and $x^2>100$, but $x<20$, what is $x$?",
    "solution": "This question gives multiple clues on what $x$ could be. Because $x^2>100$, we know that $x$ must be greater than 10, but $x$ is also less than 20. So $x$ is a multiple of 8 that is between 10 and 20. The only value that fits this description is $\\boxed{16}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the possible values of x, we need to consider the given conditions:\n\n1. $x$ is a positive multiple of 8.\n2. $x^2>100$.\n3. $x<20$.\n\nFrom condition 2, we can find the minimum value of $x$. Since $x^2>100$, we take the square root of both sides:\n$\\sqrt{x^2}>\\sqrt{100}$\nThis simplifies to:\n$x>10$\n\nSince $x$ is a positive multiple of 8 (condition 1), the possible values of $x$ are:\n$8, 16, 24,...$\n\nWe need to consider the condition $x<20$ (condition 3). This eliminates $x=24$ and any other multiple of 8 greater than 16.\n\nNow, we consider the possible values of $x$ that satisfy all three conditions:\n- $x=8$: This satisfies $x>10$, but $8^2=64$ does satisfy $x^2>100$.\n- $x=16$: This satisfies all three conditions: $16>10$, $16^2=256>100$, and $16<20$.\n\nTherefore, the possible value of $x$ is 16."
