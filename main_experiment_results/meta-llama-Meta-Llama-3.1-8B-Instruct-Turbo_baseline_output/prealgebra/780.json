    "problem": "A square 10cm on each side has four quarter circles drawn with centers at the four corners. How many square centimeters are in the area of the shaded region? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize (1.5 cm);\n\ndraw((-1,-1)--(1,-1)--(1,1)--(-1,1)--cycle);\nfilldraw(arc((1,1),1,270,180)--arc((-1,1),1,360,270)--arc((-1,-1),1,90,0)--arc((1,-1),1,180,90)--cycle,gray);\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "We first notice that the area of the shaded region is the area of the square minus the areas of the four quarter circles. Each quarter circle has a radius half the side length, so if we sum the areas of the four quarter circles, we have the area of one full circle with radius $5$ cm. Now, we know the area of a square is the square of its side length, so the square has an area of $100 \\text{ cm}^2$. A circle has an area of $\\pi$ times its radius squared, so the four quarter circles combined have an area of $\\pi(5)^2=25\\pi \\text{ cm}^2$. From this, we know that the area of the shaded region is $\\boxed{100-25\\pi} \\text{ cm}^2$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the shaded region, we can use the formula for the area of the square and the area of the quarter circles. \n\nThe area of the square is $10cm * 10cm = 100cm^2$.\n\nThe four quarter circles can be combined to form a whole circle with a radius of $5cm$. The area of this circle is $\\pi * 5^2 = 25\\pi cm^2$. \n\nHowever, this is the area of the whole circle, and we only have one fourth of the circle in the shaded region. So, we need to divide this area by 4 to get the area of the quarter circle. \n\nBut, this is the combined area of the quarter circles. To get the area of the shaded region, we need to subtract the area of the quarter circles from the area of the square: \n\n$100cm^2 - 25\\pi cm^2$. \n\nWe can also subtract the area of the whole circle from the area of the square to find the area of the shaded region:\n\n$100cm^2 - 25\\pi cm^2 = (100cm^2 - 25\\pi cm^2)$."
