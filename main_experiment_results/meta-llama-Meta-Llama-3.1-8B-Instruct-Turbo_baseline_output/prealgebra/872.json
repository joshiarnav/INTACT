    "model_solution": "To find the greatest common factor (GCF) and the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 6, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the factors of each number: \n   - Factors of 3: 1, 3\n   - Factors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6\n\n2. Identify the greatest common factor (GCF): \n   - The greatest common factor of 3 and 6 is 3.\n\n3. Find the multiples of each number:\n   - Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ...\n   - Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, ...\n\n4. Identify the least common multiple (LCM):\n   - The least common multiple of 3 and 6 is 6.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the GCF and LCM:\nSum = GCF + LCM\nSum = 3 + 6\nSum = 9\n\nTherefore, the sum of the greatest common factor of 3 and 6 and the least common multiple of 3 and 6 is 9."
