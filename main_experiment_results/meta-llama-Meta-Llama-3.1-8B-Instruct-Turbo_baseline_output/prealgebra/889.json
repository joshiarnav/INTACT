    "model_solution": "Given that altitude $CD$ of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\sqrt3$ centimeters, we can determine the area of $\\triangle ABC$ using trigonometric relationships.\n\nSince $CD$ is an altitude, $\\angle CDA$ is a right angle. Also, $\\angle CAD$ = $30^\\circ$, and we know that $\\angle CBA$ = $30^\\circ$ as well. This implies that $\\triangle ABC$ is a 30-60-90 triangle.\n\nThe ratio of side lengths in a 30-60-90 triangle is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, with the side opposite the $30^\\circ$ angle as the smallest and the hypotenuse as twice the length of the smallest side. \n\nIn $\\triangle ABC$, we have $AC = 2$ and $AB = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nTo calculate the area of $\\triangle ABC$, we use the formula $\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\n\nThe base of $\\triangle ABC$ is $AB = 2\\sqrt{3}$ and the height is $AC = 2$. Therefore, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2\\sqrt{3} \\times 2 = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nTo get the final answer, we should calculate this area using the given height of $\\sqrt3$. Therefore, using $AC = 2$ as the height, we would get the area of the triangle using the height of $\\sqrt3$ and find $2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nHowever, to find the area using the given height of $\\sqrt3$, we must use $BC$ as the height instead of $AC$ as the height since we are given the height CD of $\\triangle ABC$ as $\\sqrt3$ centimeters. \n\nSince $CD = \\sqrt3$, then in a 30-60-90 triangle $ACD$, the length $AC = 2$. Also, the length of $BC$ is equal to $AC$ times $\\sqrt3$. So $BC = AC * \\sqrt3 = 2 * \\sqrt3 = 2\\sqrt3$. \n\nUsing the base $AB = 2\\sqrt{3}$ and the height $BC = 2\\sqrt3$ for $\\triangle ABC$ in the area formula, we get $\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2\\sqrt{3} \\times 2\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6$."
