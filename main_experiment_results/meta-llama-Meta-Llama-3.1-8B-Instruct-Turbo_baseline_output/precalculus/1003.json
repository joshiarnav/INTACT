Find the normal vector of the plane: The coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation of the plane give us the components of the normal vector. So, the normal vector $\\vec{n}$ is $(3,-4,5).$\n\n2. Find the equation of the line passing through the given point $(1,2,3)$ with direction $\\vec{n}$: The parametric equation of the line is given by:\n\\[\nx = 1 + 3t, \\quad y = 2 - 4t, \\quad z = 3 + 5t\n\\]\nwhere $t$ is a parameter.\n\n3. Find the point of intersection between the line and the plane. To do this, we substitute the parametric equation of the line into the equation of the plane:\n\\[\n3(1 + 3t) - 4(2 - 4t) + 5(3 + 5t) = 30\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get:\n\\[\n3 + 9t - 8 + 16t + 15 + 25t = 30\n\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n50t + 10 = 30\n\\]\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\\[\n50t = 20\n\\]\nDivide by 50:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{20}{50} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\nSubstitute that value of $t$ back into the parametric equation of the line to find the point of intersection:\n\\[\nx = 1 + 3 \\left(\\frac{2}{5} \\right), \\quad y = 2 - 4 \\left(\\frac{2}{5} \\right), \\quad z = 3 + 5 \\left(\\frac{2}{5} \\right)\n\\]\nSimplifying the expressions, we get:\n\\[\nx = 1 + \\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{11}{5}, \\quad y = 2 - \\frac{8}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}, \\quad z = 3 + 2 = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the point in the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$ that is closest to the point $(1,2,3)$ is $\\left(\\frac{11}{5}, \\frac{2}{5}, 5 \\right).$"
