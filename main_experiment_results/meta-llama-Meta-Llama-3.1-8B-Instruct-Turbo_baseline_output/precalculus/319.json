    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the equation of the plane. We can do this by using the coordinates of the three vertices adjacent to vertex $A$.\n\nLet's denote the coordinates of the three vertices adjacent to vertex $A$ as $(10, 0, 0)$, $(0, 10, 0)$, and $(0, 0, 10)$, assuming the vertex $A$ is at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$ for simplicity.\n\nWe can express the equation of the plane in the form $Ax + By + Cz = D$, where $A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 1$.\n\nTo find the equation of the plane, we need to use the coordinates of the three vertices. We can set up the following system of equations:\n\n$10A = D$\n$10B = D$\n$10C = D$\n\nSince the distance from any of the three vertices is $10$, $11$, or $12$, we can substitute these values into the equation of the plane to find the value of $D$. However, since we are looking for the distance from vertex $A$ to the plane, we can instead use the fact that the vector from the origin to any of the three vertices is perpendicular to the plane. This means that the dot product of the normal vector of the plane with the vector from the origin to the vertex is equal to the distance from the origin to the plane.\n\nLet's denote the normal vector of the plane as $(A, B, C)$. The vector from the origin to the vertex $(10, 0, 0)$ is $(10, 0, 0)$. The dot product of these two vectors is $10A$, which is equal to $10$. Therefore, we have $10A = 10$.\n\nSimilarly, the vector from the origin to the vertex $(0, 10, 0)$ is $(0, 10, 0)$. The dot product of these two vectors is $10B$, which is equal to $11$. Therefore, we have $10B = 11$.\n\nFinally, the vector from the origin to the vertex $(0, 0, 10)$ is $(0, 0, 10)$. The dot product of these two vectors is $10C$, which is equal to $12$. Therefore, we have $10C = 12$.\n\nNow, we can find the value of $A$, $B$, and $C$. Since $10A = 10$, we have $A = 1$. Since $10B = 11$, we have $B = \\frac{11}{10}$. Finally, since $10C = 12$, we have $C = \\frac{6}{5}$.\n\nThe equation of the plane is $x + \\frac{11}{10}y + \\frac{6}{5}z = D$. We can substitute the value of $D$ into this equation to get $x + \\frac{11}{10}y + \\frac{6}{5}z = 10A = 10$.\n\nNow, we can find the distance from vertex $A$ to the plane. The distance from any point $(x, y, z)$ to the plane is $\\frac{|Ax + By + Cz - D|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}}$. In this case, the point is the origin $(0, 0, 0)$, and the distance is $\\frac{|0 + 0 + 0 - 10|}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{121}{100} + \\frac{36}{25}}} = \\frac{|-10|}{\\frac{\\sqrt{100 + 121 + 36}}{5}} = \\frac{10}{\\frac{\\sqrt{257}}{5}} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 5}{\\sqrt{257}} = \\frac{50}{\\sqrt{257}}$.\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{257}$. This gives $\\frac{50 \\cdot \\sqrt{257}}{\\sqrt{257} \\cdot \\sqrt{257}} = \\frac{50 \\cdot \\sqrt{257}}{257}$.\n\nSince the problem asks for the distance in the form $\\frac{r-\\sqrt{s}}{t}$, we can rewrite the expression as $\\frac{50 - \\sqrt{257}}{1}$. This gives $r = 50$, $s = 257$, and $t = 1$. Therefore, the sum of $r$, $s$, and $t$ is $50 + 257 + 1 = 308$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{308}$"
