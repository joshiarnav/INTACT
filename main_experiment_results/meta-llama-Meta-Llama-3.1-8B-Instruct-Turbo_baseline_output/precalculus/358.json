    "model_solution": "To find the value of $x$ for which the matrix is not invertible, we need to find the value of $x$ for which the determinant of the matrix is zero. \n\nThe determinant of a 2x2 matrix\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}\\] is given by $ad - bc$.\n\nFor the given matrix\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 + x & 7 \\\\ 3 - x & 8 \\end{pmatrix}\\], the determinant is $(1 + x)(8) - (7)(3 - x)$.\n\nExpanding this expression, we get $8 + 8x - 21 + 7x$.\n\nCombining like terms, we get $15x - 13$.\n\nSetting this expression equal to zero, we get $15x - 13 = 0$.\n\nSolving for $x$, we get $15x = 13$.\n\nDividing by 15, we get $x = \\frac{13}{15}$.\n\nSo, the value of $x$ for which the matrix is not invertible is $x = \\frac{13}{15}$."
