    "solution": "The vector pointing from $(-1,1,1)$ to $(1,-1,1)$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$  Since the plane we are interested in is perpendicular to the plane $x + 2y + 3z = 5,$ its normal vector must be orthogonal to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}.$  But the normal vector of the plane is also orthogonal to $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$  So, to find the normal vector of the plane we are interested in, we take the cross product of these vectors:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -6 \\\\ -6 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Scaling, we take $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector.  Therefore, the equation of the plane is of the form\n\\[x + y - z + D = 0.\\]Substituting the coordinates of $(-1,1,1),$ we find that the equation of the plane is $\\boxed{x + y - z + 1 = 0}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the equation of the plane, we need a normal vector to the plane and a point on the plane. \n\nFirst, we find a normal vector to the plane. Since the plane we are looking for is perpendicular to $x + 2y + 3z = 5,$ then the normal vector of our plane will be parallel to $x + 2y + 3z = 5,$ which is $\\langle 1, 2, 3 \\rangle.$ \n\nNext, we need a point on the plane. Since we know that it passes through $(-1, 1, 1)$ and $(1, -1, 1),$ we can use either of these points. We will use $(-1, 1, 1).$\n\nThe normal vector to the plane $(-1, 1, 1)$ and $(1, -1, 1)$ is the vector $\\langle -2, 2, 0 \\rangle$ which is obtained using the cross product formula between the vectors $\\langle 1 - (-1),  1-1, 1-1\\rangle = \\langle 2, 0, 0 \\rangle$ and  $\\langle 1-(-1), -1-1, 1-1\\rangle = \\langle 2, -2, 0 \\rangle$.\n\nSince $\\langle 2, -2, 0 \\rangle$ is parallel to the normal vector of our desired plane, we can use $\\langle 2, -2, 0 \\rangle$ or its scalar multiples as the normal vector. \n\nOne of the points on the plane is $(-1, 1, 1).$ \n\nThe equation of the plane can be written in the form $\\langle A, B, C \\rangle \\cdot \\langle x, y, z \\rangle = \\langle A, B, C \\rangle \\cdot \\langle x_0, y_0, z_0 \\rangle$, which is the same as $Ax + By + Cz = Ax_0 + By_0 + Cz_0.$ \n\nTherefore, we have $2x - 2y = 2(-1) - 2(1) = -4.$ \n\nDividing both sides by $2,$ we have $x - y = -2.$ \n\nWe want to find the equation in the form $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0,$ so we have to rewrite the equation $x - y = -2$ in this form. \n\nWe can rewrite the equation as $x - y - 2 = 0.$ \n\nSince the coefficients are $A = 1,$ $B = -1,$ $C = 0,$ and $D = -2,$ and $\\gcd(|1|,|-1|,|0|,|-2|) = 1,$ then the equation of the plane in the desired form is $x - y - 2 = 0,$ which is the same as $x - y - 2 = 0,$ or $x - y - 2 = 0.$"
