    "model_solution": "To find the solutions to the equation \n\\[2\\sin^3 x - 5 \\sin^2 x + 2 \\sin x = 0\\]\nwe can first factor out $\\sin x$ from the equation:\n\n\\[ \\sin x(2\\sin^2 x - 5 \\sin x + 2) = 0 \\]\n\nThe expression inside the parenthesis can be factored as\n\\[ (2\\sin x - 1)(\\sin x - 2) = 0 \\]\nHowever, we know that $-1 \\leq \\sin x \\leq 1$, so $\\sin x$ cannot equal 2.  Therefore, the equation becomes\n\n\\[ \\sin x(2\\sin x - 1) = 0 \\]\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we get the solutions \n$\\sin x = 0$ and $2\\sin x - 1 = 0$.\nTherefore, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: $\\sin x = 0$\nTo solve this equation, we need to find all values of $x$ in the range $0 \\le x \\le 2 \\pi$ that make $\\sin x = 0$.\nWe know that $\\sin x = 0$ at $x = 0, \\pi,$ and $2\\pi.$\n\nCase 2: $2\\sin x - 1 = 0$\nTo solve this equation, we need to find all values of $x$ in the range $0 \\le x \\le 2 \\pi$ that make $2\\sin x - 1 = 0$.\nSolving for $\\sin x$, we get $\\sin x = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nWe know that $\\sin x = \\frac{1}{2}$ at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ and $x = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}.$\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the equation are $x = 0, \\pi,$ and $2\\pi$ when $\\sin x = 0$, and $x = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ and $x = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$ when $2\\sin x - 1 = 0$. Combining these, we have a total of $3+2=\\boxed{5}$ solutions to the equation."
