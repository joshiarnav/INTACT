    "problem": "The foot of the perpendicular from the origin to a plane is $(12,-4,3).$  Find the equation of the plane.  Enter your answer in the form\n\\[Ax + By + Cz + D = 0,\\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D$ are integers such that $A > 0$ and $\\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|) = 1.$",
    "solution": "We can take $\\begin{pmatrix} 12 \\\\ -4 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector of the plane.  Then the equation of the plane is of the form\n\\[12x - 4y + 3z + D = 0.\\]Substituting in the coordinates of $(12,-4,3),$ we find that the equation of the plane is $\\boxed{12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0}.$",

    "model_solution": "The normal vector to the plane is the vector from the origin to the foot of the perpendicular.  This is $\\langle 12,-4,3 \\rangle.$  Therefore the equation of the plane is\n\\[12x -4y + 3z + D = 0.\\]\nTo find $D,$ we use the fact that the point $(12,-4,3)$ is on the plane, so we have that\n\\[12(12) - 4(-4) + 3(3) + D = 0 \\Rightarrow D = - 12(12) + 4(4) + 3(3) = -144 + 16 + 9 = -119.\\]\nTherefore the equation of the plane is\n\\[12x - 4y + 3z - 119 = 0.\\]"
