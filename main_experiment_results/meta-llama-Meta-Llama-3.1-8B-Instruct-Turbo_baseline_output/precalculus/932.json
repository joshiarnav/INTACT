    "model_solution": "To find the range of the function $y=\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ for $-90^\\circ< x < 90^\\circ$, we need to analyze the behavior of the cosine function and the logarithm function.\n\nSince $-90^\\circ< x < 90^\\circ$, the cosine function will be positive. In this interval, $\\cos x$ will vary from 0 to 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the square root function. Since the cosine function will be positive, we can take the square root of it without worrying about any negative values. However, we need to be mindful that the square root of a number between 0 and 1 will also be between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the logarithm function with base 2. The logarithm function will take a value between 0 and 1 (from the previous step) and return a value between minus infinity and 0.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the constraint that $\\cos x$ cannot be 0, as taking the logarithm of 0 is undefined. This means that the input of the logarithm function will always be greater than 0, but less than or equal to 1.\n\nTherefore, the range of the function $y=\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ for $-90^\\circ< x < 90^\\circ$ is the set of all real numbers $y$ such that $-\\infty < y \\leq 0$.\n\nThis can be written in interval notation as $(-\\infty, 0]$."
