  "problem": "Crestview's school colors are purple and gold. The students are designing a flag using three solid-colored horizontal stripes, as shown. Using one or both of the school colors, how many different flags are possible if adjacent stripes may be the same color?\n\n[asy]\nsize(75);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,12));\ndot((0,12));\ndraw((0,12)--(8,12)--(8,11)--(0,11));\ndraw((8,11)--(8,9)--(0,9));\ndraw((8,9)--(8,6)--(0,6));\n[/asy]",

    "To find the total number of different flags, we'll consider each horizontal stripe and the number of options for that stripe.\n\n1. The top stripe can be either purple (P) or gold (G). So, we have 2 options for the top stripe.\n\n2. The middle stripe also has 2 options (P or G).\n\n3. The bottom stripe again has 2 options (P or G).\n\nNow, to find the total number of possible flags, we need to multiply the options for each stripe. This is because each option for the top stripe can be combined with each option for the middle stripe, and each of those options can be combined with each option for the bottom stripe.\n\nSo, the total number of possible flags = 2 (options for the top stripe) * 2 (options for the middle stripe) * 2 (options for the bottom stripe) = 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^3 = 8.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{8}$ different flags possible.",
    "To find the number of different possible flags, we need to consider the choices for each stripe.\n\nFor the top stripe, we have two options: purple and gold.\n\nFor the middle stripe, we also have two options: purple and gold. Since adjacent stripes may be the same color, it doesn't matter if the top and middle stripes are the same color.\n\nFor the bottom stripe, we again have two options: purple and gold. As with the middle stripe, the choice for the bottom stripe doesn't depend on the choices for the top two stripes.\n\nSince the choices for each stripe are independent of each other, we can find the total number of possible flags by multiplying the number of options for each stripe.\n\nThat is, the total number of possible flags is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^3 = \\boxed{8}.$",
    "Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.\n\nSince there are three horizontal stripes and each stripe can be either purple or gold, there are 2 possibilities for the color of each stripe.\n\nFor the first stripe, there are 2 possible colors: purple or gold. Let's call this color $P_1$.\n\nFor the second stripe, there are 2 possible colors: purple or gold. Let's call this color $P_2$.\n\nFor the third stripe, there are 2 possible colors: purple or gold. Let's call this color $P_3$.\n\nSince the colors of each stripe are independent, we can multiply the number of possibilities for each stripe to get the total number of possible flags.\n\nThe total number of possible flags is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^3 = 8$.\n\nHowever, this includes the possibility of an all-purple flag, an all-gold flag, and two additional possibilities that have already been counted (two all-purple flag and two all-gold flags). \n\nSo the answer is $2(2^3-2)=\\boxed{24}.$",
    "To find the number of different flags possible, let's consider each stripe's color individually and the restrictions placed on their selection.\n\nFirst, the top stripe can be either purple (P) or gold (G). So, we have two options for the top stripe.\n\nNow, we have the middle stripe. Since there are no restrictions, the middle stripe can be either purple (P) or gold (G). So, we have two options for the middle stripe.\n\nLastly, the same applies to the bottom stripe. The bottom stripe can be either purple (P) or gold (G). So, we have two options for the bottom stripe as well.\n\nUsing the Fundamental Counting Principle (FCP), we can multiply the number of options for each stripe to find the total number of possible flags.\n\nTotal options = Number of options for the top stripe  * Number of options for the middle stripe * Number of options for the bottom stripe \n= 2 * 2 * 2\n= 8.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different flags possible is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "To determine the number of possible flags, we can consider the different color combinations for the three horizontal stripes. \n\nSince there are three stripes and for each stripe we have two choices (purple or gold), we might initially think that there are $2^3 = 8$ possible combinations. However, in this scenario, adjacent stripes may be the same color. This means that we have additional choices, such as all stripes being the same color (either purple or gold).\n\nTherefore, we can directly calculate the number of possible combinations using the following approach:\n1. All three stripes are purple: 1 possibility\n2. The top stripe is purple and the bottom two are gold: 1 possibility\n3. The top stripe is gold and the bottom two are purple: 1 possibility\n4. The middle stripe is purple and the others are gold: 1 possibility\n5. The middle stripe is gold and the others are purple: 1 possibility\n6. The bottom stripe is purple and the top two are gold: 1 possibility\n7. The bottom stripe is gold and the top two are purple: 1 possibility\n8. All three stripes are gold: 1 possibility\n\nHowever, this count doesn't include thelideation of the top and the bottom stripe having 3 other choices; where purple and gold meet.  This would include our answer:\n1. Purple, purple, purple = 1\n2. Gold, gold, gold = 1\n3. Gold, purple, gold = 1\n4. Purple, gold, purple = 1\n5. Purple, purple, gold = 1 \n6. Gold, gold, purple = 1\n7. Gold, purple, purple = 1 \n8. Purple, gold, gold = 1 \n9. Purple, gold, gold = 1 \n\nThis gives us a total of $\\boxed{10}$ different flag possibilities."

  "critique": "Solution 1 and Solution 2 are correct as they both provide the same answer, which is 8 different flags possible.\n\nSolution 3 is incorrect because it overcounts the possibilities.
