    "To find the first term of the sequence, we need to identify the common ratio and use it to calculate the first term.\n\nStep 1: Identify the common ratio (r).\nWe know that in a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by the common ratio. \n\nThe third term is 12, and the fourth term is 16. Using the formula for a geometric sequence (an = ar^(n-1)), we can find the common ratio by dividing the fourth term by the third term:\n\nr = (fourth term)/(third term) = 16/12 = 4/3\n\nStep 2: Use the common ratio to find the second term.\nSince the third term is 12 and the common ratio is 4/3, we can find the second term by dividing the third term by the common ratio:\n\nsecond term = 12 / (4/3) = 9\n\nStep 3: Use the common ratio and the second term to find the first term.\nSince the second term is 9 and the common ratio is 4/3, we can find the first term by dividing the second term by the common ratio:\n\nfirst term = 9 / (4/3) = 9 * 3/4 = 27/4\n\nSo, the first term of the sequence is $\\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. In a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio (r).\n\n2. We are given the third term (a3 = 12) and the fourth term (a4 = 16).\n\n3. To find the common ratio (r), we can divide the fourth term by the third term:\n   r = a4 / a3 \n   r = 16 / 12 \n   r = 4/3\n\n4. Now that we have the common ratio, we can find the second term (a2). Since a3 = a2 * r, we can rearrange this formula to get a2 = a3 / r:\n   a2 = a3 / r \n   a2 = 12 / (4/3)\n   a2 = 12 * (3/4)\n   a2 = 9\n\n5. Now that we have the second term, we can find the first term (a1). Since a2 = a1 * r, we can rearrange this formula to get a1 = a2 / r:\n   a1 = a2 / r \n   a1 = 9 / (4/3)\n   a1 = 9 * (3/4)\n   a1 = 27/4\n\nTherefore, the first term of the sequence is 27/4.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{27/4}$.",
    "To find the first term of a geometric sequence, we can use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence: \n\na_n = a_1 * r^(n-1)\n\nwhere a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.\n\nWe are given the third and fourth terms of the sequence, which are 12 and 16, respectively. \n\nWe can use the formula to write two equations:\n\n12 = a_1 * r^(3-1) \n12 = a_1 * r^2\n\n16 = a_1 * r^(4-1) \n16 = a_1 * r^3\n\nNow, we can divide the second equation by the first equation to eliminate a_1:\n\n16/12 = (a_1 * r^3) / (a_1 * r^2)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n4/3 = r\n\nNow that we know the common ratio r, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find a_1. We will use the first equation:\n\n12 = a_1 * (4/3)^2\n\nTo simplify the equation, we will first calculate (4/3)^2:\n\n(4/3)^2 = 16/9\n\nNow, we will substitute this value into the equation:\n\n12 = a_1 * (16/9)\n\nTo solve for a_1, we will multiply both sides of the equation by 9/16:\n\na_1 = 12 * (9/16)\n\nTo simplify the equation, we will calculate 12 * 9:\n\na_1 = 108/16\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we will divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:\n\na_1 = 27/4\n\nSo, the first term of the sequence is $\\boxed{27/4}$."

  "correct_answer": "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence. Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$. Solving, we have $a\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",
