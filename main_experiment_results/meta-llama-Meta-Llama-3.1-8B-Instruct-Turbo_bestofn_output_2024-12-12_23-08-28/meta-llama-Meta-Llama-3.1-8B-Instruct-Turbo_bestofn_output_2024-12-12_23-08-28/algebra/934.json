    "To find the value of 'a', we can start by using the information that the vertex of the parabola is at (-4, 0).  This means that the parabola can be written in the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$.  Now, we can plug in the point (1, -75) to the equation $y = a(x + 4)^2$ to find the value of 'a'.\n\nWe have: \n$-75 = a(1 + 4)^2$. \n\nExpanding the right-hand side, we get:\n$-75 = 25a$\n\nTo find the value of 'a', we can divide both sides of the equation by 25:\n$\\frac{-75}{25} = \\frac{25a}{25}$\n$a = -3$\n\nThe value of 'a' is therefore $\\boxed{-3}$.",
    "To find the value of $a$, we need to use the information provided about the vertex and the point $(1,-75)$.\n\nFirst, we know that the vertex form of a quadratic is given by:\n\n\\[y = a(x-h)^2 + k\\]\n\nwhere $(h,k)$ is the vertex. Given that the vertex is $(-4,0)$, we can rewrite the quadratic in vertex form as:\n\n\\[y = a(x+4)^2 + 0\\]\n\\[y = a(x+4)^2\\]\n\nSince the quadratic passes through the point $(1,-75)$, we can substitute $x=1$ and $y=-75$ into the equation:\n\n\\[-75 = a(1+4)^2\\]\n\nNow, simplify the equation:\n\n\\[-75 = a(5)^2\\]\n\\[-75 = 25a\\]\n\nTo solve for $a$, divide both sides by $25$:\n\n\\[a = \\frac{-75}{25}\\]\n\\[a = -3\\]\n\nThe value of $a$ is $\\boxed{-3}$.",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and arrive at the same answer: $a = -3$. However, Solution 1 is the most concise and straightforward, making it the best solution.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "correct_answer": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic must be of the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$.  The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, which gives us the equation $-75 = 25a$.  Hence, $a = -75/25 = \\boxed{-3}$.",
