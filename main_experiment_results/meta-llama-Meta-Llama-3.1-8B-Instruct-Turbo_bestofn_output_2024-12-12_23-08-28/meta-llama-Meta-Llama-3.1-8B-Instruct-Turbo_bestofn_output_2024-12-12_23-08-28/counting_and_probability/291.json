    "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $7!$ and $(5!)^2,$ we first need to calculate $7!$ and $(5!)^2.$\n\n$7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1.$\n\nWe can calculate $7!$ step by step:\n\n$7 \\times 6 = 42$\n$42 \\times 5 = 210$\n$210 \\times 4 = 840$\n$840 \\times 3 = 2520$\n$2520 \\times 2 = 5040$\n$5040 \\times 1 = 5040$\n\nSo, $7! = 5040.$\n\nNext, we calculate $(5!)^2.$\n\nFirst, we calculate $5!$:\n\n$5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1.$\n\nWe can calculate $5!$ step by step:\n\n$5 \\times 4 = 20$\n$20 \\times 3 = 60$\n$60 \\times 2 = 120$\n$120 \\times 1 = 120$\n\nSo, $5! = 120.$\n\nNow, we need to square $5!$ to get $(5!)^2,$\n\n$(5!)^2 = 120^2 = 14400.$\n\nNow that we have $7! = 5040$ and $(5!)^2 = 14400$, we need to find their prime factorization to find the greatest common divisor.\n\nLet's find the prime factorization of 5040:\n\n$5040 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7$\n\nNext, we find the prime factorization of 14400:\n\n$14400 = 2^6 \\times 3 \\times 5^2 \\times 8$.\n\nHowever, we note that 8 can be reduced further into $2^3$.

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct in their final answer, but let's analyze their correctness and clarity:\n\nSolution 1 is the most clear and concise. It directly calculates the prime factorization of both numbers and finds the common factors, which results in the correct answer of 720.\n\nSolution 2 also calculates the prime factorization of both numbers, but it makes a mistake when finding the prime factorization of 14400. It incorrectly reduces 8 into $2^3$, which is not necessary and leads to an incorrect prime factorization of 14400.\n\nSolution 3 is similar to Solution 1, but it uses a more general approach to find the common prime factors. However, it still arrives at the correct answer of 720.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best solution is:\n\n1",
