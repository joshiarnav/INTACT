    "To find the number of different possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between, let's consider the following steps:\n\n1. There are 5 friends sitting around the circular table. \n2. Cara can be sitting between any 2 of these 5 friends.\n3. Since the order of the friends does not matter, we need to count the number of ways to choose 2 friends out of 5.\n4. This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!)\n   where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items being chosen.\n   In this case, n = 5 and r = 2.\n5. Plugging in the values, we get: C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!)\n   = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1) * (3 * 2 * 1))\n   = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1)\n   = 10\n\nTherefore, Cara can be sitting between 10 different possible pairs of people.\n\n$\\boxed{10}$",
    "Since Cara is sitting at the center of the circular table, she has five people seated around her. To find the number of possible pairs of people that Cara could be sitting between, we need to calculate the number of combinations of two people out of the five seated people.\n\nWe start with the number of people seated to Cara's left (or right, since it's a circular table) which is five. To start, choose one person as the neighbor to Cara's left. This gives us five possible options. Since the neighbor on the right is now chosen, we have four people remaining to choose from for the neighbor on Cara's right. \n\nNow we know that in the formula for combinations we normally need to use the formula:\n\n$$\\text{Combinations}=\\binom{n}{r}=\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$ \n\nwhere $n$ is the total number of options (people) in this case and $r$ is the number of options we want to choose (neighbor on the left and neighbor on the right). For this problem, $n=5$ and $r=2$. \n\n$$\\binom{5}{2}=\\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!}=\\frac{5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2!}{2! \\cdot 3\\cdot 2}= \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{2} = \\boxed{10}.$$\n\n\n\nIn summary, we start with five people. Choose one as the neighbor on the left which gives five options. Choose one out of the remaining people (four options) as the neighbor on the right.",
    "To find the number of different possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between, we can break it down step by step.\n\n1. Since the table is circular, it doesn't matter which end Cara sits at, as the arrangement will be the same. \n\n2. There are a total of 5 friends (excluding Cara), and we need to choose 2 of them to sit next to Cara. This can be calculated using combinations (nCr), which represents the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n distinct items, without regard to the order.\n\n   In this case, we want to choose 2 friends from a group of 5, so the number of possible pairs is calculated as 5C2.\n\n   5C2 = (5!)/(2!(5-2)!)\n   5C2 = (5!)/(2!3!)\n   5C2 = ((5*4*3*2*1)/((2*1)*(3*2*1)))\n   5C2 = (5*4)/2\n   5C2 = 10\n\n3. Therefore, there are 10 different possible pairs of people that Cara could be sitting between.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{10}$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They use different approaches to calculate the number of combinations of 2 people out of 5, but they all arrive at the same answer: 10.\n\nHowever, Solution 1 is the most concise and straightforward, and it directly uses the combination formula, making it the most clear and easy to understand.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "correct_answer": "The number of pairs of neighbors for Cara actually has nothing to do with the shape of the table she is sitting at. That is, all that matters is that she has 5 friends and two of them will be her neighbors. There are ${5 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{10}$ pairs of friends that she can thus sit between.",
