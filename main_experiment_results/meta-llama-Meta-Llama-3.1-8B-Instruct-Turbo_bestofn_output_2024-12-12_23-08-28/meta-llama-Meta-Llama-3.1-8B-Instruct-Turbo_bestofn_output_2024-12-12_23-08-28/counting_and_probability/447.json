    "To find the number of ways Karl can select four crayons if the order doesn't matter, we can use the concept of combinations.\n\nStep 1: Identify the total number of crayons, which is 12.\nStep 2: Identify the number of crayons Karl wants to select, which is 4.\nStep 3: Use the combination formula: \n\nCombination = Total number of items! / (Selected items! * (Total number of items - Selected items)!)\n\nCombination = 12! / (4! * (12 - 4)!)\n= 12! / (4! * 8!)\n= (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8!) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 8!)\n= (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n= 11,880 / 24\n= 495\n\nSo, there are 495 ways Karl can select four crayons if the order doesn't matter.\n\n$\\boxed{495}$",

  "critique": "Analysis:\n\nAll three solutions are correct, but Solution 2 is the most detailed and easy to follow. It clearly explains the combination formula and provides step-by-step calculations.\n\nHowever, Solution 1 is slightly more concise and directly jumps to the calculation.\n\nSolution 3 is also clear and provides detailed steps, but it is slightly longer than Solution 1.\n\nConsidering the clarity, conciseness, and ease of understanding, Solution 1 is the best solution.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "correct_answer": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last.
