    "To design a flag, we need to choose the colors for the three horizontal stripes. Since we can use one or both of the school colors (purple and gold), there are two options for each stripe.\n\nStep 1: Choose the color for the top stripe. There are two options: purple (P) and gold (G).\nStep 2: Choose the color for the middle stripe. Regardless of the choice for the top stripe, there are also two options: purple (P) and gold (G).\nStep 3: Choose the color for the bottom stripe. Regardless of the choices for the top and middle stripes, there are also two options: purple (P) and gold (G).\n\nNow, to find the total number of possible combinations, we multiply the number of choices for each step.\n\nThe total number of possible combinations:\n1 (for the top stripe) \u00d7 2 (for the middle stripe) \u00d7 2 (for the bottom stripe) = 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as choosing the colors for the three stripes without any restrictions. Since each stripe has two options (purple and gold), the total number of possible combinations is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^3 = 8$. However, since adjacent stripes can be the same color, there are four duplicate combinations:\n\n- Case 1: PPP\n- Case 2: PPG, GPP, PGP, GGP \nThe combinations without duplicates is $8 - 4 = 4.$ Combining the logic of both premises, we get $\\boxed{8}$.\n\nThe answer could just be the removal of duplicates.\n\nThere is a way to already account for the combinations of removal of duplicates. That is, when already calculating the total number of possible combinations without duplicates is $2^3 = 8.$"
