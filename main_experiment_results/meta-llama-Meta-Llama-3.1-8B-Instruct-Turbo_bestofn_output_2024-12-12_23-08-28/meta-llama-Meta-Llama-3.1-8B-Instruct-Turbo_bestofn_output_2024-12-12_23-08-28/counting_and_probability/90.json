    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of outcomes where the product is a composite number and then divide it by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n**Step 1: Total number of possible outcomes**\nWhen rolling 5 dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes. So, the total number of possible outcomes is:\n\n6 * 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 = 6^5 = 7776\n\n**Step 2: Find the number of outcomes where the product is not composite**\nA product is not composite if at least four of the numbers are 1 and the fifth number is either 1, 2, 3, or 5. \n\nLet's count the number of outcomes for each case:\n\n- All 5 numbers are 1: There is only 1 way to get this.\n- Exactly 4 ones and one 2, 3, or 5: There are 5 ways to choose which die shows the 2, 3, or 5, and for each choice, there is only 1 way to get the 4 ones.\n- So, there are a total of 1 + 3*5 = 16 ways to get a product that is not composite.\n\n**Step 3: Find the number of outcomes where the product is composite**\nSince there are 7776 total outcomes and 16 outcomes where the product is not composite, the number of outcomes where the product is composite is:\n\n7776 - 16 = 7760\n\n**Step 4: Find the probability that the result is a composite number**\nThe probability that the result is a composite number is the number of outcomes where the product is composite divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = 7760 / 7776 = 485 / 486\n\nSo, the probability that the result is a composite number is $\\boxed{\\frac{485}{486}}$.",
    "To find the probability that the product of the numbers on the faces of the five dice is a composite number, we will first calculate the probability of getting a non-composite number and then subtract it from 1.\n\nFor the product of the numbers on the faces of the dice to be non-composite (or prime), we require at least four dice to show a 1 and the fifth die to show either a 1, 2, 3, or 5. \n\nHowever, because there is already at least one 1, when we multiply the product of the four 1s (i.e., 1) with any other die's roll, the new number is still 1 times the other number. We still require the number to stay a prime, meaning four dice have to be 1 and the other has to be 1, 2, 3, or 5 because for any larger number multiplied by 1, it remains as itself.\n\nTo count the ways to achieve this, we will consider the following:\n\n1. **Four 1s and 1 (the fifth die shows a 1).** We select one of the five dice to be 1. There are $\\binom{5}{1} = 5$ ways to do this.\n2. **Three 1s and 2 (the fifth die shows a 2).** We select three of the five dice to be 1, and the remaining two dice to be 2. There are $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways to do this.\n3. **Three 1s and 3 (the fifth die shows a 3).** We select three of the five dice to be 1, and the remaining two dice to be 3. There are $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways to do this.\n4. **Three 1s and 5 (the fifth die shows a 5).** We select three of the five dice to be 1, and the remaining two dice to be 5. There are $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways to do this.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of possible outcomes for rolling the five dice:\n\nSince each die has 6 sides, there are $6^5 = 7776$ possible outcomes.\n\nNext, we will find the probability of getting a non-composite number by summing up the ways to achieve it:\n\nWe have $5 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 35$ ways to achieve a non-composite number.\n\nNow, we will find the probability of getting a non-composite number by dividing the total number of ways to achieve it by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n$\\frac{35}{7776} \\approx 0.0045$\n\nHowever, we only want the probability that the result is a composite number, which is equal to 1 minus the probability that the result is not a composite number.\n\n$\\boxed{1 - \\frac{35}{7776}} = \\boxed{\\frac{7741}{7776}}$",
    "To solve this problem, let's first consider the total number of outcomes. Each die has 6 possibilities (1 through 6), so the total number of outcomes for 5 dice is $6^5 = 7776$.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes that don't result in a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. The numbers that are not composite are 1 and prime numbers.\n\nWhen all 5 dice show 1, the product is 1. This results from 1 possible outcome.\n\nWhen exactly 4 dice show 1 and the fifth die shows 2, 3, or 5 (prime numbers), the product is a prime number. This results from $3\\cdot 5=15$ possible outcomes (3 choices for the prime die and 5 choices for the remaining die to be 1).\n\nWhen exactly 3 dice show 1 and the other two show 2, 3, or 5 (prime numbers), the product is a prime number. This results from $3\\cdot 2\\cdot 4=24$ possible outcomes (3 choices for the first prime die, 2 choices for the second prime die, and 4 choices for the remaining die to be 1).\n\nWhen exactly 2 dice show 1 and the other three show 2, 3, and 5 (prime numbers), the product is a prime number. This results from $3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=6$ possible outcomes (3 choices for the first prime die, 2 choices for the second prime die, and 1 choice for the third prime die).\n\nWhen none of the dice show 1, the product will not be a composite number only if all the dice show a prime number. The prime numbers on the dice are 2, 3, and 5. If two dice show a 2 and three dice show a 3 or five, the product will be a composite number since it has 2 as a factor. However, if two dice show a 2 and one die shows a 5, the product will be a prime number since only the product with the die showing 5 would make it a composite number. So the number of outcomes that are not a composite number when no die shows 1 is 3 * ( 2 * 2  ) = 12 possible outcomes (3 choices for which prime die shows a 5 and 2 choices for which die with a 2 is duplicated and  and only one outcomes to choose that is required and 2 for two dice).\n\nTo find the total number of outcomes that don't result in a composite number, we sum up the outcomes from each case: $1 + 15 + 24 + 6 + 12 = 58$.\n\nFinally, the number of outcomes that result in a composite number is the total number of outcomes minus the number of outcomes that don't result in a composite number: $7776 - 58 = 7718$.\n\nSo the probability that the result is a composite number is $\\boxed{\\frac{7718}{7776}}$ which in simplest form is $\\boxed{\\frac{3869}{3888}}$."

  "correct_answer": "While it is almost tempting to make this into the casework problem to end all casework problems, using complementary probability makes the problem a lot simpler, so we will find the probability that the product is not composite.\n\nIt's clear that if more than one die shows a roll greater than 1, the resulting product will have more than one factor that is greater than 1 and therefore be composite. Additionally, if any of the dice show a 4 or a 6, the product will obviously be composite. So in order for the product to not be composite, we need at least four dice to be a 1 and the fifth die to either be another 1 or a 2, a 3, or a 5.\n\nThere's exactly one way in which all the the dice can be 1's, and for each of the other three cases there are 5 ways since the die that isn't a 1 can appear in any of the 5 other positions, so there are a total of $3\\cdot5+1=16$ ways of rolling the dice that result in a product that isn't composite. Additionally, there are 6 options for the roll of each of the 5 dice for a total of $6^5=7776$ possible outcomes, which means that the probability of the product not being composite is $\\dfrac{16}{7776}$ and the probability that it is composite is $1-\\frac{16}{7776}=\\frac{7760}{7776}=\\boxed{\\frac{485}{486}}$.\n\nNote: Many students have tried to argue that 1 is not a prime number and should not be counted. As we are doing complementary probability, it is important to consider all numbers that are not composite, and 1 is definitely not composite.",
