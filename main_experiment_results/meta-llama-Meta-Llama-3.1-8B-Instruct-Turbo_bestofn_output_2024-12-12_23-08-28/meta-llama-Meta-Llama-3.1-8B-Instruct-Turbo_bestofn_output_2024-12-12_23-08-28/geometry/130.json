    "To solve for $\\angle QRC$, we need to break down the problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: The problem mentions that the sides of triangle PQR are tangent to a circle with center C. This implies that C is the incenter of triangle PQR. In other words, C is the point of concurrency of the angle bisectors of the triangle. \n\nStep 2: Let's find the measure of angle PRQ. Given that $\\angle PQR = 63^\\circ$ and $\\angle QPR = 59^\\circ$, we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's denote $\\angle PRQ$ as $x$. \n\n$\\angle PRQ + \\angle PQR + \\angle QPR = 180^\\circ$\n\n$x + 63^\\circ + 59^\\circ = 180^\\circ$\n\n$x = 58^\\circ$\n\nStep 3: Now, let's look at the triangle PRC. We know that CR is the angle bisector of angle QPR. Since CR is the angle bisector, we can use the fact that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into two segments that are proportional to the other two sides. However, we don't have the lengths of PR, QC, and RC. But we have the angle measures of PRQ and PQR. \n\nStep 4: Note that we don't need the lengths of PR, QC, and RC to find the measure of angle QRC. The angle QRC is half the measure of angle PRQ. \n\nSo, the measure of angle QRC is $\\boxed{29^\\circ}$",
    "To solve for $\\angle QRC$, we first need to find the measure of $\\angle PRQ$.\n\nSince the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we have: \n$\\angle PQR + \\angle QPR + \\angle PRQ = 180^\\circ$.\n\nUsing the given values of $\\angle PQR = 63^\\circ$ and $\\angle QPR = 59^\\circ$, we can plug them in and solve for $\\angle PRQ$:\n\n$63^\\circ + 59^\\circ + \\angle PRQ = 180^\\circ$\n\n$122^\\circ + \\angle PRQ = 180^\\circ$\n\n$\\angle PRQ = 180^\\circ - 122^\\circ$\n\n$\\angle PRQ = 58^\\circ$\n\nNext, we need to find the measure of $\\angle CRQ$. We know that the incenter $C$ of a triangle is equidistant to all sides, and since $\\angle PRQ$ is an inscribed angle, we can use its half to find $\\angle CRQ$.\n\nIn this case, $\\angle PQR$ is half of a central angle and has a measure of $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 63^\\circ$ because the central angle that has $Q$ and $R$ as endpoints would be twice $\\angle PQR$. Since a central angle of a circle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle, $\\angle PQR$ is half of its central angle. The same applies for all inscribed angles. Thus, $\\angle CRQ$ has a measure of $30.75^\\circ$. \n\nWe will convert the values into $30$ because in a later step we divide $58^\\circ$ by $2$ which gives us $29$ but since $PQ$ and $QR$ both set $Q$ and $P$ and $R$ tangently we'll call the angles $\\angle PQD$ instead and $\\angle QRD$ simply $\\angle PRQ \\div 2 = \\boxed{29}$.\n\n\n\nNow since $C$ is the center of a circle, we know that $\\angle PRC$ and $\\angle QRC$ are angles formed by the distance from $C$ to the sides of the triangle $PQR$. $\\angle PRC$ and $\\angle QRC$ are supplementary angles.\n\nIn addition, we know that $\\angle PRC$ is equal to $180^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 29^\\circ$ since $\\angle PRQ$ is twice the measure of $\\angle CRQ$. \nTherefore,\n$\\angle PQC = 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ -\\boxed{29}$\n\nThen we solve $\\boxed{162-90-29}$.\n\nTherefore,\n$\\angle PQC = 43^\\circ$\n\nWe now have the measures of two angles of $\\triangle PQC$.\n\n\n$\\angle QRC + \\angle PQC = 180^\\circ - \\angle PRQ$.\n\nUsing our current equation, we have\n\n$\\angle QRC + 43^\\circ = 180^\\circ - 58^\\circ$\n\n$\\angle QRC + 43^\\circ = 122^\\circ$\n\n$\\angle QRC  = 122^\\circ - \\boxed{43}$\n\nTherefore,\n$\\angle QRC = 79^\\circ$",
    "To solve this problem, let's start by breaking down the given information.\n\n1. We know that $\\angle PQR = 63^\\circ$ and $\\angle QPR = 59^\\circ$.\n\n2. The sides of triangle $PQR$ are tangent to a circle with center $C$, so $C$ is the incenter of $PQR$. \n\n3. The incenter of a triangle is the point of intersection of the angle bisectors of the triangle.\n\nWe know that the angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. Also, the incenter is equidistant from the sides of the triangle. \n\nLet's first find $\\angle PRC$ and $\\angle PRQ$, then we can find $\\angle QRC$.\n\nSince $C$ is the incenter of triangle $PQR$, then $\\angle PRC = \\frac{1}{2} \\angle PRP$. However, $\\angle PRP$ is not given directly. We can find it using the information we have.\n\nThe sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so $\\angle PRP = 180^\\circ - \\angle PQR - \\angle QPR = 180^\\circ - 63^\\circ - 59^\\circ = 58^\\circ$.\n\nNow, we can determine $\\angle PRC = \\frac{1}{2} \\angle PRP = \\frac{1}{2} * 58^\\circ = 29^\\circ$.\n\nWe also know that $\\angle PRC$ and $\\angle PRQ$ are supplementary because $C$ lies on $PR$, therefore we can find $\\angle PRQ$ by using $180^\\circ - 29^\\circ$.\n\nSo $\\angle PRQ = 151^\\circ$.\n\nHowever, $\\angle PRQ$ is an exterior angle of $\\triangle QRC$, therefore it is equal to $\\angle QRC + \\angle CQR$.\n\nFrom the information given we have, $\\angle CQR$ can be written as  $180^\\circ - \\angle QRC - \\angle PRQ$.\n\nUsing the previously found values we get  $180^\\circ - \\angle QRC - 151^\\circ$.\n\nAlso, $\\angle PQR = \\angle QRC + \\angle PRQ$.\n\nTherefore, $\\angle QRC + \\angle QRC + 151^\\circ = 63^\\circ$, so $\\angle QRC = 63^\\circ - 151^\\circ$.\n\n\nHowever, that calculation made an error in calculation. $\\angle QRC + \\angle PRQ$ actually equals to $\\angle PQR$. It means  that $\\angle QRC + 151^\\circ = 63^\\circ$. This calculation is flawed since it uses an incorrect equality $\\angle PQR = \\angle QRC + \\angle PRQ$, which isn't actually the case in the figure given."
