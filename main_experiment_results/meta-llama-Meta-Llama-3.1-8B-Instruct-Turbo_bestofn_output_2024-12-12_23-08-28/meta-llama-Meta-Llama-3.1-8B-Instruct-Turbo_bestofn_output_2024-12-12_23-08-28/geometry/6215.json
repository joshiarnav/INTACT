    "To solve this problem, we first need to use the given information that $\\triangle PAB$ is similar to $\\triangle PCA$. In similar triangles, corresponding sides are proportional. Therefore, we can set up a proportion using the ratio of the lengths of the sides. \n\nGiven that $\\triangle PAB \\sim \\triangle PCA$, we can set up the proportion $\\dfrac{PA}{PC}=\\dfrac{PB}{PA}$. Note that $PA=8$ and $PC = 6 + x$, where $x$ is the length of $PC$.\n\nWe do not know what $PB$ is. However, we do know that $AB + BC = 8 + 7 = 15$. When side $BC$ is extended to point $P$, $PC - CB = 15 - CB$. Note that $PC = (6 + x)$. Also, we know that $PC = PB + BC$ because $P$ is on the extension of side $BC$.\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get $6 + x = PB + 7$.\n\nSubstituting $(6 + x)$ for $PB + 7$, we have $(6 + x) = (6 + x)$.\n\nHowever, we also know that $\\dfrac{PA}{PC}=\\dfrac{PB}{PA}$. Thus, $\\dfrac{8}{6 + x}=\\dfrac{15 - CB}{8}$.\n\nAlso, we do not know $PB$. But we do know that $PC = PB + CB$. Thus, $PC = 6 + x = PB + 7$.\n\nWe know that $\\dfrac{8}{6 + x}=\\dfrac{15 - CB}{8}$.\n\nWe can say that $\\dfrac{8}{6 + x}=\\dfrac{15 - (7)}{8}$. We can simplify this to $\\dfrac{8}{6 + x}=\\dfrac{8}{8}$. We can simplify this further to $\\dfrac{8}{6 + x}=1$.\n\nWe know that $\\dfrac{8}{6 + x}=1$. We can cross-multiply this to get $8 = 6 + x$. We can subtract 6 from both sides to get $2 = x$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "Since $\\triangle PAB$ is similar to $\\triangle PCA$, the corresponding sides are proportional.\n\nWe can express the relationships between the lengths of the sides of the triangles as follows:
