    "To find the area of the regular octagon $ABCDEFGH$, we start by noting that $BDEF$ is a square, which means $BD = DE = 2 + x$, where $x = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow let's examine triangles $\\triangle ABC, \\triangle ACD, \\triangle ADE$, and $\\triangle AFE$. These are all right triangles with hypotenuse $2$, and the legs have lengths of $1$ each. Using the Pythagorean Theorem or recognizing it as a 45-45-90 triangle, we conclude that $BC$ and $CA$ both have length $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFrom the sketch, we see that each of the triangles has side lengths $1, 1,$ and $2$, making each triangle isosceles.\n\nWe need to find the area of each of the triangles and the square to get the area of the octagon. We can get the side of the square as $2+2x$. We have the diagonal of the octagon as  $\\sqrt2 \\cdot 2 + 2x$ Now to find the area of the octagon, we add up the area of $BCDE$ (the square) and the areas of the triangles that have been left. Using double angles for the heights of the triangles:  Their bases will add up to  4+2x so total area will be $\\frac{1}{2}(4+2x) \\cdot (2+2x)+4x^2=8x$.",
    "To find the area of the regular octagon, we can break down the process into several steps.\n\nStep 1:  The given figure consists of a regular octagon $ABCDEFGH$ and a square $BDEF$.\nStep 2:  Firstly, we know that $AB = BC = 1$ as mentioned in the problem statement.\nStep 3:  To find the area of the octagon, we should first identify the side length and then use it to calculate the area of the octagon.\nStep 4:  By using the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle $ABC$, we can find the length of the side diagonal of the square. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get $AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2$, so $AC = \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we can calculate the side length of the square. Since the diagonal is $\\sqrt{2}$, each side of the square is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 1$.\nStep 6:  Knowing this, we can identify that the side length of the regular octagon and the square are the same, i.e., $\\sqrt{2}$ is the side length of the square and diagonal of the square, and $1$ is the side length of the diagonal of the triangles $ABC$ and $DCB$. Thus the total side length of the regular octagon can be given as 1 + $\\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 7:  Now that we know the side length of the regular octagon, we can find its area using the formula for the area of a regular polygon: $\\text{Area} = \\frac{a^2n}{4\\tan(\\pi/n)}$, where $a$ is the side length and $n$ is the number of sides.\nStep 8:  Here, the side length of the regular octagon is $1 + \\sqrt{2}$ and it has 8 sides (since it's an octagon). So the formula for the area becomes $\\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})^2*8}{4\\tan(\\pi/8)}$.\nStep 9:  We need to find the value of $\\tan(\\pi/8)$. We know that the $\\tan(\\pi/8) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}+1}$.\nStep 10:  Using the formula for the area of a regular polygon, $\\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})^2*8}{4\\tan(\\pi/8)}$, we can plug in the value of $\\tan(\\pi/8)$ and simplify the expression to get the area of the regular octagon.\n\nTo find the value of $\\tan(\\pi/8)$ in the expression $\\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})^2*8}{4\\tan(\\pi/8)}$, we can use the formula for the tangent of a half-angle: $\\tan(\\frac{\\pi}{8}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2+1}}$.\nUsing the half-angle formula for $\\tan(\\frac{\\pi}{8}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}+1}$, we can find the value of $\\tan(\\frac{\\pi}{8})$ and substitute it in the formula to find the area of the octagon.\n\nSubstituting $\\tan(\\pi/8) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}+1}$ into the formula for the area of a regular polygon gives us $\\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})^2*8}{4\\tan(\\pi/8)} = \\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})^2*8}{4*\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}+1}} = \\frac{8*(1+\\sqrt{2})^2}{\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{2}+1}} = 2*(\\sqrt{2}+1)^2 * \\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{2}$.\nUsing the identity $(\\sqrt{2}+1)^2 = 2 + 2*\\sqrt{2}+1 = 3+2\\sqrt{2}$, we can plug in this value into the expression for the area of the regular octagon.\n\n$\\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})^2*8}{4\\tan(\\pi/8)} = 2 * (3+2\\sqrt{2}) * \\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{2} = (3+2\\sqrt{2}) * (\\sqrt{2}+1)$.\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression further by multiplying the terms.\n\n$(3+2\\sqrt{2}) * (\\sqrt{2}+1) = (3+2\\sqrt{2})*(\\sqrt{2}+1) = 3\\sqrt{2} + 3 + 2\\sqrt{4}+2\\sqrt{2} = 3\\sqrt{2} + 3 + 4 + 2\\sqrt{2} = 7 + 5\\sqrt{2}$\n\nSo, the area of the regular octagon is $7 + 5\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the area of the regular octagon is $\\boxed{7 + 5\\sqrt{2}}$ square units.",
    "To find the area of the regular octagon, we need to break down the shape into simpler forms and calculate their areas.\n\nFirst, let's draw the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ of the square $BDEF$ to divide it into smaller right triangles. \n\nAs given, $AB = BC = 1$, so triangle $ABC$ is an isosceles right triangle, meaning the two legs have a length of 1 and the hypotenuse has a length of $\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe total area of a right isosceles triangle can be expressed as $A=\\frac{1}{2}( base)(height)$ since $\\frac{1}{2}(1)(1)=\\frac{1}{2}$. Since each side of square $BDEF$ has a length of $AB+BC+CD+DE = 1+1+1+\\sqrt{2} = 3+\\sqrt{2}$ the area of the square is $(3+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\n\nNow, let's look at the smaller triangles created by drawing the diagonals. $FBCD$ is a square with side length $1$, $BACE$ is a right triangle with two sides of length 1, and the other triangles have area of $\\frac{1}{2}(1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)$.\n\nSubtract the area of the non-square triangles from the total area of $BDEF$ to get the total area of the octagon.\n\nThe area of a square $FBCD$ is calculated by $(1)^2 = 1$.\nThe area of right isosceles triangle $ABD$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(1)(1) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince $DE$ has length $\\sqrt{2}$, right triangles with a side length of $\\sqrt{2}$ have a hypotenuse of 1, resulting in a base of length 1. In this situation, the base of the other right isosceles triangle has length 1, with an area of $\\frac{1}{2}(1)(1) = \\frac{1}{2}$. $B$ to $D$ diagonal base length is $1+\\sqrt{2}$ so base length of $2^{\\text{nd}}$ diagoanl is $3+\\sqrt{2}$ and side $B$ to $D$ of length $1+\\sqrt{2}$ has area of this base-length multiplied by length of triangle's non-hypotenuse diagonal which is $\\frac{1}{2}(1+\\sqrt{2})(2) = (1+\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nAdding up the areas of $DCEF$ right isosceles, $B$ to $D$, and $DE$ to $B$ before subtracting the area of $2^{\\text{nd}}$ diagonal of diagoanls before gives the area of $2^{nd}$ diagonal base, resulting in\n\n$A=\\frac{1}{2}( (1)^2 + 2^{\\text{nd}} \\text{ non square triangle area} + 2^{\\text{nd}} \\text{ non square triangle area} + (1+\\sqrt{2}))$.\nPlugging In $(1+\\sqrt{2})$ into the formula gives the area of the 2nd non-square triangle base, which is $A=(\\frac{1}{2})*((1)^2 + (1+\\sqrt{2}) + (1+\\sqrt{2}) + 1+\\sqrt{2})$.\nPlugging in base-length $(1+\\sqrt{2})$ into the area $of triangle$ which is base of diagoanl-length $(2)(1+\\sqrt{2})$ will give the final area of diagoanl $B$ to $D$.\nSince $A=(\\frac{1}{2})*((1)^2 + 4(1+\\sqrt{2}))$ then $A=\\frac{1}{2} (1 + 4 + 4\\sqrt{2})$ which can be simplified to $A=(\\frac{1}{2} +2 + 2\\sqrt{2})$, resulting in $A = 2 + (2+\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nPlugging in base length $(\\sqrt{2})$ resulting in base of diagoanl $B$ to $D$ length of $(2+\\sqrt{2})$ and subtracting non square triangle area of $(\\sqrt{2}-1)$ of two equal triangle's area gives\n\n$(2+\\sqrt{2}) - (2(\\sqrt{2}-1))$ resulting in $(2+\\sqrt{2})-(2\\sqrt{2}-2)$ which can be simplified to  $(2+\\sqrt{2})-(2\\sqrt{2}-2) = (2+2-\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{2})$ resulting in $(2-2) + (\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{2})$ which simplifies to $2-2$, the resulting equation from subtracting non-square triangle before simplified to $(2-2)+(\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{2}) = 0$\n\nSince the base length $(2+\\sqrt{2})$ results in non-square triangle area $(\\sqrt{2}-1)$ this resulting base-length of length $(2+\\sqrt{2})$ gives $(\\sqrt{2}-1) = (\\sqrt{2} -1)*2$ resulting in before subtracting non-square triangle area resulting in the following.\n\nSubtract area $(2(\\sqrt{2}-1))$ from base of diagoanl $B$ to $D$ length of $(2+\\sqrt{2})$ in\n\n$(2 + \\sqrt{2}) - (2\\sqrt{2} - 2)$ which results in the before simplified to\narea resulting in $(2+\\sqrt{2})-(2\\sqrt{2}-2)$ the base-length $(2+\\sqrt{2})$ results in non-square triangle area $(\\sqrt{2}-1)$, this resulting\n\nfrom the base of diagoanl-length $B$ to $D$ non square triangle area resulting in resulting $B$ to $D$ resulting area $(2+\\sqrt{2})$ minus resulting non square triangle area resulting in subtracting diagoanl-length base of $(\\sqrt{2}-1)$\nSubtract the resulting base diagoanl of length $(2+\\sqrt{2})$\nresults in $area of $diagoanl$ of B$ to $D$ of length $(\\sqrt{2}-1)$ subtracting diagoanl-length base of $(\\sqrt{2}-1)$ which results in  $(2+\\sqrt{2})-(2\\sqrt{2}-2)$ simplified to $(2-2)+(\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{2})$ resulting in non-square triangle area of $(\\frac{1}{2}(3+\\sqrt{2})^2)-[(4)]$ resulting in $(\\frac{1}{2}(3+\\sqrt{2})^2)-4$ resulting in\n\n$[(\\frac{1}{2})(7+2\\sqrt{2})]^2 -[(\\frac{1}{2})(7)$ results in $((\\frac{1}{2})(\\sqrt{2})$ resulting in $(\\frac{7}{2} + (\\sqrt{2}))(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}) - (7 * (\\frac{1}{2}))$ which can be simplified to $((7+\\sqrt{2})) -  (3)$ resulting in $\\frac{7}{2}+\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ before subtracting area of right isosceles triangle base with a side length of $(1+\\sqrt{2})$ base-length. since this will give the area of this base of a length of $(1+\\sqrt{2})$ which is \n\n$-((1+\\sqrt{2})(\\frac{1}{2})*2)$\nSince this resulting from the base of length $(1+\\sqrt{2})$ results in area $of triangle$ which is base of diagoanl-length $(2)(1+\\sqrt{2})$ will give the final area of diagoanl $B$ to $D$. before subtracting area of right isosceles triangle resulting in \n$(\\frac{1}{2}(3+\\sqrt{2})^2)-[(\\frac{1}{2}(3+\\sqrt{2})^2 -[(4)]$ resulting in this base area subtracting area of right isosceles triangle base with a side length of $(1+\\sqrt{2})$ base-length\n\n$(\\frac{1}{2}(3+\\sqrt{2})^2)-[(\\frac{1}{2}(3+\\sqrt{2})^2 -[(4)] since this resulting from the base of length $(1+\\sqrt{2})$ results in area $of triangle$ which is base of diagoanl-length $(2)(1+\\sqrt{2})$ will give the final resulting area\n\n$[(7)-[(4] ) resulting in\n\n$[(7)-4]$ resulting in\narea of base of this base-length subtracting area of right isosceles triangle base with a side length of $(1+\\sqrt{2})$ base-length which results in before simplified to\n\n$[(3)]$ resulting in $[(3)]$ resulting in base of diagoanl $B$ to $D$ base of length $(2+\\sqrt{2})$ which base of diagoanl $"
