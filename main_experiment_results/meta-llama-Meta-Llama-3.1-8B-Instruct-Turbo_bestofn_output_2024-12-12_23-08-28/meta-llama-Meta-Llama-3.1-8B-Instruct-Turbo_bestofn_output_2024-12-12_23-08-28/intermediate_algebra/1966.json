    "To find the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$, we can use the properties of a geometric sequence. \n\nA geometric sequence has the form $a, ar, ar^2,...$ where $r$ is the common ratio.\n\nWe are given that $a_1 = 1$, which is the first term. We can write the first three terms as:\n\n$a_1 = 1$\n$a_2 = a_1r = r$\n$a_3 = a_2r = r^2$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into $4a_2 + 5a_3$, we get:\n\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2$\n\nTo find the smallest possible value, we can complete the square:\n\n$4r + 5r^2 = 5 \\left( r^2 + \\frac{4}{5} r \\right)$\n$= 5 \\left( r^2 + \\frac{4}{5} r + \\frac{4}{25} \\right) - 5 \\cdot \\frac{4}{25}$\n$= 5 \\left( r + \\frac{2}{5} \\right)^2 - \\frac{4}{5}$\n\nThe expression $r + \\frac{2}{5}$ is always greater than or equal to $0$, so the smallest possible value of $5 \\left( r + \\frac{2}{5} \\right)^2$ is $0$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of the entire expression is:\n\n$\\frac{-4}{5}$ \n\nHowever, our instructions were to put the answer in a box format.",
    "To find the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3,$ we need to understand the properties of a geometric sequence. In a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed constant, called the common ratio, denoted as $r.$\n\nGiven that the first term $a_1 = 1,$ we can write the expressions for the second and third terms as follows:\n\n$a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r = 1 \\cdot r = r$\n\n$a_3 = a_2 \\cdot r = r \\cdot r = r^2$\n\nNow, we need to find the expression for $4a_2 + 5a_3$ in terms of $r.$ Substituting the expressions for $a_2$ and $a_3$ from above, we get:\n\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2$\n\nTo find the smallest possible value of this expression, we can complete the square. We start by factoring out the common factor $r$ from the terms involving $r^2$:\n\n$4r + 5r^2 = 5(r^2 + \\frac{4}{5}r)$\n\nNow, we can add and subtract $\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2$ inside the parentheses to complete the square:\n\n$5\\left(r^2 + \\frac{4}{5}r + \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 \\right)$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$5\\left[\\left(r + \\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2\\right]$\n\nNow we have the square of a binomial:\n\n$5\\left(r + \\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 - \\frac{4}{5}$\n\n$=5\\left(r + \\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2-\\frac{4}{5}$\n\nTo find the smallest possible value of this expression, we note that the square of any real number is non-negative. Therefore, the smallest possible value of the expression is when the square term is zero, i.e., when $r + \\frac{2}{5} = 0.$\n\nSolving for $r$ gives:\n\n$r = -\\frac{2}{5}$\n\nSubstituting this value of $r$ into the expression $5\\left(r + \\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2-\\frac{4}{5},$ we get:\n\n$5\\left(-\\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2-\\frac{4}{5}$\n$= 5(0)-\\frac{4}{5}$ = -4/5\n\nSo, the minimum value of the given expression is -4/5.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}}$.",
    "To find the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$ in a geometric sequence with the first three terms $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $a_3$ and given $a_1 = 1,$ we first recall the definition of a geometric sequence:\n\nA geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio ($r$).\n\nGiven $a_1 = 1,$ we can express the first three terms as follows:\n\n$a_1 = 1$\n$a_2 = a_1 \\times r = 1 \\times r = r$\n$a_3 = a_2 \\times r = r \\times r = r^2$\n\nNow we want to minimize $4a_2 + 5a_3$. Substituting the expressions for $a_2$ and $a_3$, we get:\n\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2$\n\nWe can see that $4r + 5r^2$ is a quadratic function of the form $ar^2 + br + c$. To minimize a quadratic function, we typically take its derivative and set the result equal to zero:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dr} (5r^2 + 4r) = 10r + 4$\n\nNow we set the derivative equal to zero:\n\n$10r + 4 = 0$\n\nSolving for $r$, we get:\n\n$10r = -4$\n$r = -\\frac{4}{10}$\n$r = -\\frac{2}{5}$\n\nTo confirm that this value of $r$ is indeed a minimum, we can take the second derivative:\n\n$\\frac{d^2}{dr^2} (5r^2 + 4r) = 10 > 0$\n\nSince the second derivative is positive, we have a minimum.\n\nSubstituting $r = -\\frac{2}{5}$ back into $4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2$, we get:\n\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4(-\\frac{2}{5}) + 5(-\\frac{2}{5})^2$\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = -\\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{20}{25}$\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = -\\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{4}{5}$\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = \\frac{-8 + 4}{5}$\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = \\frac{-4}{5}$\n\nSo the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}}$."

  "critique": "Solution 1 is correct. \n\nAll three solutions follow the same steps to find the minimum value of the expression $4a_2 + 5a_3$ in terms of the common ratio $r$ of a geometric sequence.

  "correct_answer": "Let $r$ be the common ratio.  Then $a_2 = r$ and $a_3 = r^2,$ so\n\\[4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2 = 5 \\left( r + \\frac{2}{5} \\right)^2 - \\frac{4}{5}.\\]Thus, the minimum value is $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}},$ which occurs when $r = -\\frac{2}{5}.$",
