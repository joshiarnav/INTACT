    "To find the set $S$ of all real numbers $x$ such that $f_n(x) = x$ for some positive integer $n,$ we need to first understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \\frac{x + 6}{x}$ and its iterates.\n\nLet's examine the equation $f(x) = x.$ We have\n\\[\\frac{x + 6}{x} = x \\implies x + 6 = x^2.\\]This is a quadratic equation in $x,$ which has two solutions: \n\\[x = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(1)(0)}}{2(1)} \\implies x = -3 \\pm 2 \\sqrt{1} = -3 \\pm 2.\\]\n\nTherefore, the solutions to $f(x) = x$ are $x = -5$ and $x = -1.$\n\nNow, suppose that for some positive integer $n,$ we have $f_n(x) = x.$ Then by definition of $f_n$ and the composition of functions, we have that\n\\[f(f_{n - 1}(x)) = x \\implies f_n(x) = f^{-1}(x)\\]because the inverse of the function is the function composed with itself.\n\nTo show that $f$ is its own inverse, suppose we have $y = f(x).$ We must have \n\\[x = f^{-1}(y) \\implies x = \\frac{y + 6}{y}.\\]Substituting the expression for $y$ in terms of $x$ from the definition of $f,$ we have\n\\[x = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{x + 6}{x}\\right) + 6}{\\left(\\frac{x + 6}{x}\\right)} = \\frac{x + 6 + 6x}{x + 6} = \\frac{7x + 6}{x + 6} = f(x).\\]\n\nThus, the inverse of the function $f$ is itself, which implies that $f^2(x) = f(f(x)) = f^{-1}(x)$ where $f^2$ represents applying $f$ twice.\n\nHence, if $f^k(x) = x$ for some $x$ and positive integer $k,$ then by induction we have that $f^{k + 1}(x) = f(f^k(x)) = f(x).$\n\nThus, the sequence of applications of $f$ modulo the multiplication of the sequence by itself will keep cycling in repetition of the value of $f^2(x)$ and so the only $x$ that is element of the set $S$ is $f^2(x)=x$ that has the $f(x)$ solution $x = -5$ or $x = -1$.\n\nTherefore, the number of elements in the set $S$ is $2$ since there are $2$ real roots of the equation $f^2(x) = x$ from the $x = -5$ and the $x= -1$.\n\nHence the final solution is: $\\boxed{2}$",
