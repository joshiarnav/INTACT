    "To find the slant asymptote, we can divide the numerator by the denominator using polynomial long division or synthetic division. \n\nGiven the rational expression $y = \\frac{2x^2 + 3x - 7}{x-3}$, we first need to perform the division.\n\n1. Divide the leading term of the numerator, $2x^2$, by the leading term of the denominator, $x$. This results in $2x$.\n\n2. Multiply the entire denominator, $x-3$, by $2x$. This gives $2x^2 - 6x$.\n\n3. Subtract $2x^2 - 6x$ from the original numerator $2x^2 + 3x - 7$. This yields $9x - 7$.\n\n4. Now, we divide the new leading term, $9x$, by the leading term of the denominator, $x$. This gives $9$.\n\n5. Multiply the entire denominator, $x-3$, by $9$. This gives $9x - 27$.\n\n6. Subtract $9x - 27$ from the result from step 3, $9x - 7$. This results in $20$.\n\nThe quotient from the division is $2x + 9$ with a remainder of $20$. However, the remainder, $20$, is a constant and will not affect the slant asymptote, since as $x$ approaches infinity or negative infinity, the remainder portion of the fraction becomes negligible.\n\nTherefore, the slant asymptote is the line $y = 2x + 9$.\n\nNow that we have the equation of the slant asymptote, we can find $m+b$.\n\nThe equation of the slant asymptote is $y = mx + b$. \n\nComparing it to the given equation $y = 2x + 9$, we see that $m = 2$ and $b = 9$. \n\nSo, $m + b = 2 + 9 = 11$.\n\nThus, the final answer is $\\boxed{11}$.",
