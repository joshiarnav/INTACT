    "We are given a system of equations involving $a,b,c,$ and $d$. We can use a technique involving a quadratic polynomial. \n\nLet's consider a monic quadratic polynomial $p(x) = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)(x-d)$. Expanding this out, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\np(x) &= (x^2 + (a + b)x + ab)(x^2 + (c + d)x + cd)\\\\\n&= x^4 + (a + b + c + d)x^3 + ((ab + ac + ad) + (bc + bd + cd))x^2 \\\\\n&\\quad + (acd + acd + acd + ad + ad + ad + ac + bc)x + abcd.\n\\end{align*} Comparing coefficients, we have $p(x) = x^4 + (a + b + c + d)x^3 + (ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd)x^2 + ...$\n\nWe can see that the system of given equations matches the coefficients of $p(x)$ except for the last equation, which asks for $abcd$, but doesn't give us information about this variable directly.\n\nWe also have a known monic quadratic polynomial $q(x) = x^4 + 15x^3 + 78x^2 + 160x + 96$. Since both $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ have the same coefficients except for the last term, $p(x) = q(x)$.\n\nTherefore, we have found $p(x) = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)(x-d)$, so we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)(x-d) = (x + 4)(x + 3)(x + 8)(x + 6).\n\\end{align*}This implies that $(a, b, c, d)$ is a permutation of $(\u22124, \u22123, \u22128, \u22126)$. We see that the square of each of these values is $16, 9, 64,$ and $36$. \n\nHence, the sum of the square of these values is $16 + 9 + 64 + 36 = 125$. However, we are looking for the greatest possible value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$, so we take the values that are the greatest. In this case, it is the values of $a=-3$, $b=-8$, $c=-4$ and $d=-6$, which results in the greatest value of\n\n\\boxed{125}.",
    "Let's analyze the given system of equations and solve it step by step.\n\nFirst, we can notice that the left-hand side of each equation can be expressed as the result of substituting the first equation into the subsequent equations, to form a polynomial expression of the form:\n\n\\[ (x^2 - 15x + 78)(x^2 - 15x + 160) = x^4 - 30x^3 + 311x^2 - 5400x + 12544 \\]\n\nExpanding the product on the left side of the equation we obtain the polynomial above,\n\nExpanding this and equating it to the right-hand side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ x^4 - 30x^3 + 311x^2 - 5400x + 12544 = (x^2 - 15x + 96)(x^2 - 15x + 169) \\]\n\nThis means that the first equation represents a form of factorization of the  fourth-degree polynomial:\n\n$$(x^2 - 15x + 78)(x^2 - 15x + 160) = x^4 - 30x^3 + 311x^2 - 5400x + 12544$$\n\nExpanding the product on the left side of the equation, we obtain the fourth-degree polynomial:\n\n$$ x^4 - 30x^3 + 311x^2 - 5400x + 12544 $$\n\nThis can also be factored as:\n\n$$(x^2 - 15x + 96)(x^2 - 15x + 169)$$\n\nNow we must solve for x, which gives us the potential solutions of a, b, c and d.

    "To solve this problem, we'll approach it by first computing the square of the expression we are interested in. This helps us find an equation to work with, and from there, we can arrive at the expression we are looking for.\n\nLet's define $p(a,b,c,d) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$. \n\nThe first step is to expand $p(a,b,c,d)$: \n\\begin{align*}\np(a,b,c,d) & = (a^2 + b^2) + (c^2 + d^2) \\\\\n& = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) + (c^2 + 2cd + d^2) - 2(ab + cd)\\\\\n& = (a + b)^2 + (c + d)^2 - 2(ab + cd)\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, let's substitute the given values: \n\n\\begin{align*}\n(a + b)^2 & = 15^2 = 225,\\\\\n(ab + cd) & = 78, \\\\\n(c + d)^2 & = (c+d)(c+d)\\\\\n& = (78-cd)/b\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow we can plug the known values into the equation for p(a,b,c,d):\n\n$$p(a,b,c,d) = (a + b)^2 + (c + d)^2 - 2(ab + cd)$$ \n\n$$p(a,b,c,d) = (225)+ ( (78)/b)-2(78)$$ \n\n$$p(a,b,c,d) = (225)+ (78)/b-156 $$ \n\nIf b is not equal to zero, we get: \n\n $$p(a,b,c,d) = (69)+ (78)/b $$. \n\nIf $p(a,b,c,d)$ is to be at its maximum, then $b$ must be equal to 1 in order to maximize the expression. \n\n$$p(a,b,c,d) = (69)+ (78)$$. \n\nIf the first case where b is not equal to zero is to be ignored, we can also assume $b=0$. \n\n$$c+d=78/0$$ \n\nIn this case, $ c+d = \\infty$. $c+d$ also equals infinity in the expression: \n\n$$p(a,b,c,d) = (a + b)^2 + (c + d)^2 - 2(ab + cd) $$ \n\n$$p(a,b,c,d) = (225)+ (\\infty)^2-2(78)$$ \n\n$$p(a,b,c,d) = (225)+ \\infty $$ \n\nEven if this expression also equals infinity, in the first case where b equals 1, we get a finite value. So we ignore the first case where b is not equal to zero in this step of the explanation.\n\nHowever the given system also gives $ (c+d)^2 = (c+d)(c+d)$. If b is zero then c must also equal zero because the original system is\n\n\\begin{align*}\na+b&=15,\\\\\nab+c+d&=78,\\\\\nad+bc&=160,\\\\\ncd&=96.\n\\end{align*}\n\nIf c equals zero then\n\n$$ (c+d)^2 = (0+d)^2 = (d)^2 $$\n\n$$ (d)^2 = 96 $$.  \n\nHowever since $(d)^2 = 96$ then d is either $4\\sqrt3$ or $-4\\sqrt3$. \n\nIn this case either d is equal to $4\\sqrt3$ or d is equal to $-4\\sqrt3$. If we also assume $a=15$ and $b =0$ in the original system, we get\n\n$$ ad+bc = 15* (4\\sqrt3)+ 0* c $$\n\n$$160 = 60\\sqrt3$$. This also equals infinity because it contains the imaginary number $i*\\sqrt3$. This also equals infinity in the first case where b equals 1 in the first step of the explanation in this response, so in this step of the explanation, we also ignore this expression because in the first case where b equals 1 in the first step of the explanation, we get a finite value.\n\nIf $b=0$ in the first step of the explanation of this response and we assume d is equal to $-4\\sqrt3$, then in the first step of this response we get the following\n\n$$ (c+d)^2 = (d)^2 $$\n\n$$ (c+(-4\\sqrt3))^2 = (-4\\sqrt3)^2 $$\n\n $$(c-4\\sqrt3)^2 = (4\\sqrt3)^2 $$\n\n$$c^2 + (2* (4\\sqrt3)) c +(4\\sqrt3)^2 = (4\\sqrt3)^2 $$\n\n$$c^2 + (8\\sqrt3) c + (4\\sqrt3)^2 = (4\\sqrt3)^2 $$\n\n$$c^2 + (8\\sqrt3) c + 48 -48 = 48-48 $$\n\n $$c^2 + (8\\sqrt3) c +48 =48 $$\n\n $$(c^2 + (8\\sqrt3) c) = -48+48 $$\n\n$$c^2 + (8\\sqrt3) c = 0 $$\n\nHowever in order to have an integer solution, we also have to assume that \n\n$$c^2 + (8\\sqrt3) c = 0 $$\n\n$$c = 0 $$\n\nHowever since c = 0, then d = -4\\sqrt3\n\nIf we assume d = -4\\sqrt3 then we get an expression with the imaginary number i*\\sqrt3. Since in the first case where b = 1 we get a finite value, we also ignore this expression. \n\nNow that we've explained how to ignore some of the explained cases, let's explain the answer to the problem.\n\nWe know that $(d)^2 = 96$. The only possibilities for this are \\begin{align*}\n(d)^2 & = (4\\sqrt3)^2 \\\\\n(d)^2 & = (4\\sqrt3)^2\n\\end{align*}\n\nIf d is equal to $4\\sqrt3$ and we assume either d equals $4\\sqrt3$ or a equals 15 in the original system, we get an expression with the imaginary number $i*\\sqrt3$. In order to have an integer solution, we also have to assume that in the original system when d equals $4\\sqrt3$ both d equals $4\\sqrt3$ and a is not equal to 15. In this case we get the system\n\\begin{align*}\na+b&=15,\\\\\nab+c+d&=78,\\\\\nad+bc&=160,\\\\\ncd&=96\n\\end{align*}\n\nSubstituting d = $4\\sqrt3$ we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\na+b&=15,\\\\\nab+4\\sqrt3+c&=78,\\\\\na*4\\sqrt3 + bc&=160,\\\\\nc* 4\\sqrt3 & = 96\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom this point onwards, the solution will follow the format requested.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nc* 4\\sqrt3 & = 96 \\\\\nc&=96/ (4\\sqrt3) \\\\\nc&= 24/ \\sqrt3 \\\\\nc&= (24\\sqrt3)/ 3\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow that we know c, we can also find the value of b using the expression\n\n\\begin{align*}\nab+4\\sqrt3+c&=78\n\\end{align*}\n\nIf c is equal to (24\\sqrt3)/3 and we substitute this in the expression, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\nab+4\\sqrt3+ (24\\sqrt3)/3&=78 \\\\\nab+4\\sqrt3+ (8\\sqrt3)&=78 \\\\\nab+12\\sqrt3 & = 78\n\\end{align*}\n\nIf d is equal to $4\\sqrt3$, then we can also substitute c = (24\\sqrt3)/3 in the expression\n\n\\begin{align*}\na+b&=15,\\\\\na* 4\\sqrt3 + bc&=160\n\\end{align*}\n\n\\begin{align*}\na* 4\\sqrt3 + b* (24\\sqrt3)/3 & = 160 \\\\\na* 4\\sqrt3 + b* (8\\sqrt3)& = 160 \\\\\na* 4\\sqrt3 & = 160 -8\\sqrt3 b\n\\end{align*}\n\nIf we also use the fact that in the original system when d equals $4\\sqrt3$ and either d equals $4\\sqrt3$ or a equals 15 we have to assume that when d equals $4\\sqrt3$ and either d equals $4\\sqrt3$ or a equals 15 in the original system in the first step of the explanation we ignore the first case where b is not equal to zero because in the first case where b equals 1 in the first step of the explanation in the first step of the explanation in this response we get a finite value, and the given system also gives $(d)^2 = 96$, we can also assume that\n\n$a* 4\\sqrt3 = 160 -8\\sqrt3 b$\n\n$a* 4\\sqrt3 = (160 -8\\sqrt3 b)/4\\sqrt3$\n\n$a="
