    "To find the residue of the given expression $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3$ modulo 14, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Calculate $182\\cdot 12$:\n   Since we only care about the residue modulo 14, we'll consider 182 and 12 in terms of their residues modulo 14. \n   - The residue of 182 modulo 14 is 182 - 14(13) = 182 - 182 = 0.\n   - The residue of 12 modulo 14 is 12.\n\n   Now we multiply these residues: \n   $182\\cdot 12 \\equiv 0\\cdot 12 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{14}$\n\n2.

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I can confirm that all three solutions arrive at the same correct answer, which is 10.\n\nHowever, I would recommend Solution 2 as the best solution. Here's why:\n\n1. **Efficiency**: Solution 2 breaks down the problem into manageable steps, each of which is straightforward to calculate. This approach is more efficient than calculating the entire expression first and then finding the residue modulo 14.\n\n2. **Clarity**: The steps in Solution 2 are clearly labeled and easy to follow. Each step is well-explained, making it easier for readers to understand the solution.\n\n3. **Modular arithmetic properties**: Solution 2 takes advantage of the properties of modular arithmetic, such as the fact that $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $ac \\equiv bc \\pmod{m}$. This approach is more elegant and easier to understand than calculating the entire expression first.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is **Solution 2**.\n\nIndex: 2",
  "correct_answer": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7. So the residue of the sum is  $$\n182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\equiv \\boxed{10} \\pmod{14}.\n$$",
