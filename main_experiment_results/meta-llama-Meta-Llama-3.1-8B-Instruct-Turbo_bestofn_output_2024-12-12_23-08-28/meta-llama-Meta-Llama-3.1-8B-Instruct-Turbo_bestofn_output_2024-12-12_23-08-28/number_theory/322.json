    "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, let's consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Hundred's Place:** Since we're looking for the largest three-digit number, let's start by considering the largest possible hundreds digit, which is 9. \n\n2. **Tenths and Units Place:** Now we need to find the largest possible tens and units digits that are not only less than the hundreds digit but also meet the problem's conditions. Since the digits must be distinct, non-zero, and the number must be divisible by each of its digits, the smallest possible digit should be 1 and 2, because it would eliminate 0 and 1 from the set of possible tens and units digits.\n\n3. **Divisibility Rule:** For a number to be divisible by each of its digits, it must be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on. The number formed from the hundreds, tens, and units digits must be divisible by all of these numbers.\n\n4. **Considering Divisibility by 2:** Since 2 and 5 are the only even digits left, one of the tens or units digits must be 2. If the tens digit is 2, then the units digit can be 4, 6, or 8. If the units digit is 2, then the tens digit can be 4, 6, or 8.\n\n5. **Considering Divisibility by 3, 5, and 6:** Now we need to find a combination that is also divisible by 3, 5, and 6. While trying all possible combinations, we can find the largest possible three-digit number.\n\n6. **Possible Combinations:** After trying the combinations, the largest possible three-digit integer divisible by its distinct, non-zero digits is 936. However, it must be verified whether the number 936 meets the conditions.\n\n7. **Verification:** \n   - The digits are distinct, non-zero, and the number 936 is divisible by each of its digits.\n\n8. **Final Answer:** \n   Thus, the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits is $\\boxed{936}$.",
    "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the largest possible hundreds digit, which is 9. This is because if the number is not divisible by 9, it can't be the largest.\n\n2. Next, we need to find a digit for the tens place. Since the number has to be divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we can start with 8. However, we need to consider other factors, such us if the units digit can be 7 or less such that the number is a three-digit integer.\n\n3. However, we can use a shortcut here to find the largest suitable units digits: the number 3 \u00d7 9 is equal to 27 and is a multiple of 3; however,  $9 \\times 8$ = 72, which is divisible by 8. But we need to keep it under 900. \n\n4. If we start with the units place digit 7, and therefore the tens place digit 8, we get a three-digit integer 987. However, 987 is not divisible by 3 since the sum of its digits $9+8+7$ = 24 and is divisible by 3 but doesn't use the digit 9 and doesn't meet our original requirements when 9 is the hundreds place.\n\n5. Let's use a digit 6 for the units place. The tens place must be a number such that it is divisible by 6. But it is also divisible by 3 $9+6$ = 15, which is a multiple of 3. A suitable candidate is 8, as in 876. However,  $9 \\times 6$ = 54, which is divisible by 6.\n\n6. If we start with the units place digit 5, and therefore the tens place digit 8, we get a three-digit integer 985. But, $ $9+8+5$  =22, which is not a multiple of 5. \n\n7. But we can have $9 \\times 6$ = 54, which is divisible by 6, and then $9\\times 5$ = 45. Therefore, let's try the number 6 and the number 5.\n\n8. If we start with the units place digit 6, and therefore the tens place digit 5, we get a three-digit integer 965. However,  $9+6+5$   is a multiple of 3 but when we try to keep three digits. 96 is not divisible by 5 but 65 is a divisor of 975.\n\nSo, $975$ is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, and the hundreds digit is 9 (the largest possible), and thus $\\boxed{975}$ is the solution.",
    "We need to find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits. Let's denote the three-digit integer as 100a + 10b + c, where a, b, and c are distinct, non-zero digits.\n\nTo start, we can try the largest possible value for a, which is 9. If a = 9, the integer is divisible by 9, and we need to ensure that it is also divisible by b and c. Since a, b, and c are distinct and non-zero, b and c can be any two distinct, non-zero digits from 1 to 8 (excluding the digit 9). We need to check all possible pairs of b and c to find the largest integer that satisfies the condition.\n\nWe can also use the divisibility rule for 3 and the sum of digits, which states that if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, then the number is also divisible by 3. Since a = 9, the sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 3 to be divisible by 9 and 3. This gives us (9 + b + c) mod 3 = 0.\n\nLet's consider the pairs (b, c) from 1 to 8 and check which of them satisfy the condition:\n\n1. (b, c) = (1, 2): 9 + 1 + 2 = 12, not divisible by 3.\n2. (b, c) = (1, 4): 9 + 1 + 4 = 14, not divisible by 3.\n3. (b, c) = (1, 5): 9 + 1 + 5 = 15, divisible by 3.\n4. (b, c) = (1, 6): 9 + 1 + 6 = 16, not divisible by 3.\n5. (b, c) = (1, 7): 9 + 1 + 7 = 17, not divisible by 3.\n6. (b, c) = (1, 8): 9 + 1 + 8 = 18, divisible by 3.\n7. (b, c) = (2, 3): 9 + 2 + 3 = 14, not divisible by 3.\n8.

(b, c) = (3, 7): 9 + 3 + 7 = 19, not divisible by 3.\n17. (b, c) = (3, 8): 9 + 3 + 8 = 20, not divisible by 3.\n18. (b, c) = (4, 5): 9 + 4 + 5 = 18, divisible by 3.\n19. (b, c) = (4, 6): 9 + 4 + 6 = 19, not divisible by 3.\n20. (b, c) = (4, 7): 9 + 4 + 7 = 20, not divisible by 3.\n21. (b, c) = (4, 8): 9 + 4 + 8 = 21, divisible by 3.\n22. (b, c) = (5, 6): 9 + 5 + 6 = 20, not divisible by 3.\n23. (b, c) = (5, 7): 9 + 5 + 7 = 21, not divisible by 3.\n24. (b, c) = (5, 8): 9 + 5 + 8 = 22, divisible by 2 and 11,  but  not 3, discard.\n25. (b, c) = (6, 7): 9 + 6 + 7 = 22, divisible by 2 and not by 3, discard.\n26. (b, c) = (6, 8): 9 + 6 + 8 = 23, not divisible by 3.\n27. (b, c) = (7, 8): 9 + 7 + 8 = 24, divisible by 3 and not 2 or 7, discard.\n\nSome integers that satisfy all conditions are 117, 138, 156, and 318.\n\nAmong them, the largest one is $\\boxed{318}$"

  "critique": "Let's analyze each solution for correctness:\n\nSolution 1:\nThe solution correctly identifies the largest possible hundreds digit as 9 and then considers the divisibility by 2, 3, 5, and 6. However, it does not systematically check all possible combinations of digits, which might lead to missing some possible solutions.\n\nSolution 2:\nThis solution starts with the largest possible hundreds digit, which is 9. It then systematically checks all possible combinations of tens and units digits, considering the divisibility by 3, 5, and 6. The solution correctly identifies the largest possible three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits as 975.\n\nSolution 3:\nThis solution uses a systematic approach to check all possible combinations of digits, considering the divisibility by 3. However, it only checks a limited number of pairs of digits (b, c) and does not consider all possible combinations. Additionally, the solution does not check for divisibility by 2, 5, and 6, which might lead to missing some possible solutions.\n\nBased on the analysis, Solution 2 is the most comprehensive and correct solution. It systematically checks all possible combinations of digits, considering the divisibility by 3, 5, and 6, and correctly identifies the largest possible three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits as 975.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2. The index number of the best solution is 2.",
  "correct_answer": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",
