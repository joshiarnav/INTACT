    "To solve the congruence $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$, we first need to simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$. \n\nWe find that $1234 \\pmod{7} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$ because $1234 \\div 7 = 176$ with a remainder of 2.\n\nNow the congruence becomes $17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. \n\nTo simplify this, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of $17 \\pmod{7}$, which is the same as finding the multiplicative inverse of $3 \\pmod{7}$, since $17 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nSince 3 and 7 are relatively prime, the inverse exists. The inverse of 3 mod 7 is 5 because $3 \\cdot 5 = 15 = 2 \\cdot 7 + 1$. Thus, $3^{-1} \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nNow we can multiply both sides of the congruence $17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$ by $5$ (which is equivalent to multiplying by $3^{-1}$).\n\nThis results in $n \\equiv 2 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nTo simplify $n \\equiv 10 \\pmod{7}$, we find that $10 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ because $10 \\div 7 = 1$ with a remainder of $3$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "To solve $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Reduce the modulus**: First, we find the remainder of 1234 when divided by 7. We have $1234 \\div 7 = 176$ with a remainder of 2. Therefore, $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n2. **Reduce the coefficient of $n$**: Next, we find the remainder of 17 when divided by 7. We have $17 \\div 7 = 2$ with a remainder of 3. Therefore, $17 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n3. **Simplify the congruence**: Now, we have $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n4. **Find the multiplicative inverse**: To solve the congruence $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 7. This is the number $x$ such that $3x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n   We can find this number by trial and error, going through the numbers 1 to 6 to see which one gives $3x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. The solution is $x = 5$, since $3(5) = 15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n5. **Solve for $n$**: Substituting the multiplicative inverse of 3, which is 5, into $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, we have $3(5)n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. This simplifies to $15n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n   Since we know that $15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$, we have $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n   The least positive $n$ such that $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$ is 2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is $\\boxed{2}$.",

  "correct_answer": "First, we simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$ to $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, we have $$17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$This means that $17n$ can be written in the form $7a+2$, where $a$ is an integer.
