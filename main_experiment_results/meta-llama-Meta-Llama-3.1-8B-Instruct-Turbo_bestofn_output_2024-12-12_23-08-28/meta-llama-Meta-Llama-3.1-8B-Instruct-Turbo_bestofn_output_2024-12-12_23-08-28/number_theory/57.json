    "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. When one of the three integers is divided by $24,$ the remainder is $10.$ This means the integer can be expressed as $24a + 10,$ where $a$ is an integer.\n\n2. When another of the three integers is divided by $24,$ the remainder is $4.$ This means the integer can be expressed as $24b + 4,$ where $b$ is an integer.\n\n3. When the third integer is divided by $24,$ the remainder is $12.$ This means the integer can be expressed as $24c + 12,$ where $c$ is an integer.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of these three integers:\n\nSum = $(24a + 10) + (24b + 4) + (24c + 12)$\n\nCombining like terms:\n\nSum = $24a + 24b + 24c + 10 + 4 + 12$\n\nFactoring out the $24$:\n\nSum = $24(a + b + c) + 26$\n\nNow, since $24(a + b + c)$ is divisible by $24$ (because it's a multiple of $24$), the remainder will be the remainder when $26$ is divided by $24$.\n\nTo find the remainder when $26$ is divided by $24$, we can subtract the smaller number from the larger number: \n\n$26 - 24 = 2$\n\nSo, the remainder is $2$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{2}$",
    "To find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\nLet the three integers be $a$, $b$, and $c$.

    "To find the sum of the remainders when the integers are divided by 24, we add the given remainders.\n\nThe first integer has a remainder of 10, \nthe second integer has a remainder of 4, \nand the third integer has a remainder of 12.\n\nThe sum of the remainders is: 10 + 4 + 12 = 26\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 26 is divided by 24.
