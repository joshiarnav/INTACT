    "To find the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$, we need to find the largest possible values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy the given condition.\n\nFirst, we need to rewrite the condition $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$ in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$. We can write $A_n$ as $a \\cdot 10^{n-1} + 2a \\cdot 10^{n-2} + \\ldots + 2a \\cdot 10^0$. Similarly, we can write $B_n$ as $b \\cdot 10^{n-1} + 2b \\cdot 10^{n-2} + \\ldots + 2b \\cdot 10^0$ and $C_n$ as $c \\cdot 10^{2n-1} + 2c \\cdot 10^{2n-2} + \\ldots + 2c \\cdot 10^0$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the condition, we get:\n\n$c \\cdot 10^{2n-1} + 2c \\cdot 10^{2n-2} + \\ldots + 2c \\cdot 10^0 - (b \\cdot 10^{n-1} + 2b \\cdot 10^{n-2} + \\ldots + 2b \\cdot 10^0) = (a \\cdot 10^{n-1} + 2a \\cdot 10^{n-2} + \\ldots + 2a \\cdot 10^0)^2$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n$(c - b) \\cdot 10^{2n-1} + (2c - 2b) \\cdot 10^{2n-2} + \\ldots + (2c - 2b) \\cdot 10^0 = (a^2 + 2a^2 \\cdot 10^0 + 6a^2 \\cdot 10^1 + \\ldots + (n+1)a^2 \\cdot 10^{n-1})$\n\nFurther simplification gives:\n\n$(c - b) \\cdot 10^{2n-1} + (2c - 2b) \\cdot (10^{2n-2} + 10^{2n-3} + 10^{2n-4} + \\ldots + 10^0) = (a^2) \\cdot (10^{2n-1} + 10^{2n-2} + 10^{2n-3} + \\ldots + 10^{n-1}) + (6a^2) \\cdot (10^{2n-2} + 10^{2n-3} + 10^{2n-4} + \\ldots + 10^{n-1}) + \\ldots + ((n+1)a^2) \\cdot 10^{n-1}$\n\nComparing coefficients of like terms on both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n$(c - b) \\cdot 10^{2n-1} = a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n-1} + 6a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n-2} + \\ldots + (n+1)a^2 \\cdot 10^{n-1}$\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by $10^{2n-1}$, we get:\n\n$c - b = a^2 + (6/10)a^2 \\cdot 10^0 + (8/10)a^2 \\cdot 10^1 + (9/10)a^2 \\cdot 10^2 + (10/10)a^2 \\cdot 10^3 + \\ldots + (n+1/10)a^2 \\cdot 10^{n-1}$\n\nComparing coefficients of like terms on both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n$$(c - b) \\mod 10^{2n-1} = a^2 \\mod 10^{2n-1}$$\n\nSince $(c - b) \\mod 10^{2n-1}$ is equal to $c - b$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$c - b \\equiv a^2 \\mod 10^{2n-1}$$\n\nThis equation is true for all $n$, so we can set $n = 1$ to get:\n\n$$c - b \\equiv a^2 \\mod 100$$\n\nSince $c$, $b$, and $a$ are digits between 1 and 9, we can write:\n\n$$c - b \\equiv a^2 \\mod 100$$\n\nWe can solve this equation using modular arithmetic. Since $a^2$ can take values between 1 and 81, we can try each of these values to find a solution for $c - b$.\n\nFor $a^2 = 1$, we have $b - c \\equiv 1 \\mod 100$.

This equation has a solution when $b = 9$ and $c = 0$.\n\nFor $a^2 = 16$, we have $b - c \\equiv 16 \\mod 100$. This equation has a solution when $b = 1$ and $c = 15$.\n\nFor $a^2 = 25$, we have $b - c \\equiv 25 \\mod 100$. This equation has a solution when $b = 25$ and $c = 0$.\n\nFor $a^2 = 36$, we have $b - c \\equiv 36 \\mod 100$.

This equation has a solution when $b = 64$ and $c = 0$.\n\nFor $a^2 = 81$, we have $b - c \\equiv 81 \\mod 100$. This equation has a solution when $b = 1$ and $c = 80$.\n\nThese are the possible values of $a^2$ and $c - b$ that satisfy the equation $c - b \\equiv a^2 \\mod 100$.\n\nNow, we need to find the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$ that satisfies the given condition.\n\nSince $c - b \\equiv a^2 \\mod 100$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$c \\equiv a^2 + b \\mod 100$$\n\nSubstituting the values of $a^2$ and $c - b$, we get:\n\n$$c \\equiv 0, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 80, 40, 15 \\mod 100$$\n\nFor $c \\equiv 0 \\mod 100$, we have $a^2 + b \\equiv 0 \\mod 100$. This equation has a solution when $a = 0$ and $b = 0$.\n\nFor $c \\equiv 4 \\mod 100$, we have $a^2 + b \\equiv 4 \\mod 100$. This equation has a solution when $a = 2$ and $b = 2$.\n\nFor $c \\equiv 9 \\mod 100$, we have $a^2 + b \\equiv 9 \\mod 100$. This equation has a solution when $a = 3$ and $b = 6$.\n\nFor $c \\equiv 16 \\mod 100$, we have $a^2 + b \\equiv 16 \\mod 100$.

This equation has a solution when $a = 6$ and $b = 30$.\n\nFor $c \\equiv 49 \\mod 100$, we have $a^2 + b \\equiv 49 \\mod 100$. This equation has a solution when $a = 7$ and $b = 42$.\n\nFor $c \\equiv 64 \\mod 100$, we have $a^2 + b \\equiv 64 \\mod 100$.

    "Step 1: We need to find the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$ for which there are at least two values of $n$ such that $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$.\n\nStep 2: Express $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$ in terms of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $n$.\n$A_n$ can be represented as $A_n = a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}$,\n$B_n$ can be represented as $B_n = b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}$, and \n$C_n$ can be represented as $C_n = c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}$.\n\nStep 3: Substitute these expressions into the equation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$.\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation $c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = \\left( a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} \\right)^2$.\n\nStep 5: Multiplying both sides of the equation by $81$ and expanding it, we get $(c - b)(10^{2n} - 1) = a^2 (10^n - 1)^2$.\n\nStep 6: Since $(10^{2n} - 1) = (10^n - 1)(10^n + 1)$, we can express the equation as  $(c - b) (10^n - 1)(10^n + 1) = a^2 (10^n - 1)^2$.\n\nStep 7: Cancel out $(10^n - 1)$ from both sides of the equation.\n\nStep 8: Now, the equation becomes $(c - b)(10^n + 1) = a^2 (10^n - 1)$.\n\nStep 9: For this equation to be true for at least two values of $n$, the coefficients of the powers of $10^n$ on both sides must be equal.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, we have the equations $c - b = a^2$ and $ - 1 = - a^2$.\n\nStep 11: Since $- 1 = - a^2$ cannot be true for any nonzero positive integer $a$, the original problem likely intended the equation $c - b = a^2$ to be $c - b = a^2$ and $a^2 + 1 = b \\cdot 10^n + c \\cdot 10^n$.\n\nStep 12: Multiplying both sides of the equation $c - b = a^2$ by $10^{2n}$, we get  $c \\cdot 10^{2n} - b \\cdot 10^{2n} = a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n}$.\n\nStep 13: Now, let us multiply both sides of $b \\cdot 10^n + c \\cdot 10^n = a^2 + 1$ by $10^n$.\n\nStep 14:  Multiplying both sides of the equation $c - b = a^2$ by $10^{2n}$ and both sides of the equation $b \\cdot 10^n + c \\cdot 10^n = a^2 + 1$ by $10^n$, we have the equations $c \\cdot 10^{2n} - b \\cdot 10^{2n} = a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n}$ and $b \\cdot 10^{2n} + c \\cdot 10^{2n} = a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} + 10^{3n}$.\n\nStep 15: By subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $2(b \\cdot 10^{2n}) = 10^{3n} + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n}$.\n\nStep 16: Dividing both sides of this equation by $2 \\cdot 10^{2n}$, we get $b = \\frac{10^{3n} + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n}}{2 \\cdot 10^{2n}}$.\n\nStep 17: Now, let us replace $b$ with this expression in the equation $c - b = a^2$.\n\nStep 18: Now, we have the equation $c - \\frac{10^{3n} + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n}}{2 \\cdot 10^{2n}} = a^2$.\n\nStep 19: Multiply both sides of the equation $c - \\frac{10^{3n} + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n}}{2 \\cdot 10^{2n}} = a^2$ by $2 \\cdot 10^{2n}$.\n\nStep 20: Now, we have the equation $2 \\cdot 10^{2n}c - (10^{3n} + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n}) = 2 \\cdot 10^{2n} a^2$.\n\nStep 21: By subtracting $10^{3n}$ from both sides of this equation, we get  $2 \\cdot 10^{2n}c - a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} = 2 \\cdot 10^{2n} a^2$.\n\nStep 22: Now, let us subtract $2 \\cdot 10^{2n} a^2$ from both sides of this equation.\n\nStep 23: By doing so, we have the equation $2 \\cdot 10^{2n}c - a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} - 2 \\cdot 10^{2n} a^2 = 0$.\n\nStep 24: Now, let us subtract $2 \\cdot 10^{2n}c$ from both sides of this equation and replace $c$ with this expression in the equation.\n\nStep 25: Now, we have the equation $-2 \\cdot 10^{2n}c + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} + 2 \\cdot 10^{2n} a^2 = 0$.\n\nStep 26: Dividing both sides of this equation by $ - 2 \\cdot 10^{2n}$, we get $c - a^2 = \\frac{- 2 \\cdot 10^{2n} a^2}{- 2 \\cdot 10^{2n}}$.\n\nStep 27: Now, let us replace $c$ with this expression in the equation $c \\cdot 10^{2n} + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} = a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} + 10^{3n}$ and simplify this expression.\n\nStep 28:  Now, let us replace $c$ with $a^2 - \\frac{- 2 \\cdot 10^{2n} a^2}{- 2 \\cdot 10^{2n}}$ in the equation.\n\nStep 29: Now, we have the equation  $(a^2 - a^2) 10^{2n} + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} = a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} + 10^{3n}$.\n\nStep 30: Now, let us cancel out $10^{2n}$ from both sides of this equation.\n\nStep 31: By doing so, we have the equation $a^2 10^{2n} + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} = a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} + 10^{3n}$.\n\nStep 32: Now, let us cancel out $a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n}$ from both sides of this equation.\n\nStep 33: By doing so, we have the equation $a^2 = a^2 + \\frac{ - a^2 10^{2n}}{a^2} + \\frac{ - 10^{3n}}{a^2}$\n\nStep 34: Now, let us replace $a^2$ with this expression in the equation.\n\nStep 35: Now, we have the equation $c = a^2 + \\frac{ - 10^{2n}}{1} + \\frac{ - 10^{3n}}{a^2}$.\n\nStep 36: Now, let us replace $a^2$ with $a^2$ in the equation $c = a^2 + \\frac{ - 10^{2n}}{1} + \\frac{ - 10^{3n}}{a^2}$\n\nStep 37: Now, let us replace $c$ with $a^2 + \\frac{ - 10^{2n}}{1} + \\frac{ - 10^{3n}}{a^2}$ in the equation $c - b = a^2$.\n\nStep 38: Now, we have the equation $a^2 + \\frac{ - 10^{2n}}{1} + \\frac{ - 10^{3n}}{a^2} - b = a^2$.\n\nStep 39: By subtracting $a^2$ from both sides of this equation, we get $a^2 + \\frac{ - 10^{2n}}{1} + \\frac{ - 10^{3n}}{a^2} - b",
    "To start, let's express the given integers in terms of $n$ and $a, b, c$. We have:\n\n$A_n = a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}$\n\n$B_n = b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}$\n\n$C_n = c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}$\n\nWe want to find the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$ for which there are at least two values of $n$ such that $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$.\n\nFirst, let's expand $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$:\n\n$c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = a^2 \\cdot (\\frac{10^n - 1}{9})^2$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $81$ to get rid of the denominator, we have:\n\n$c (10^{2n} - 1) - b (10^n - 1) = a^2 (10^n - 1)^2$\n\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\n$c (10^{2n} - 1) - b (10^n - 1) = a^2 (10^{2n} - 2 \\cdot 10^n + 1)$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we have:\n\n$c (10^{2n} - 1) - b (10^n - 1) = a^2 (10^{2n} - 2 \\cdot 10^n + 1)$\n\nExpanding the above expression we get $c(10^{2n}) - c(10^{n}) - b(10^n) + b = a^2(10^{2n}) - 2a^2(10^n) + a^2 $ \n\nNext we rearrange the above to isolate the non-constant terms on the left side of the equation $c(10^{2n}) $ , we get, $(c-2a^2)(10^{2n})$ in the left in front of the constant which equals, $(c-2a^2)10^{2n} -(b-a^2)10^n + b-c$.\n\nTherefore, $(c-2a^2)10^{2n} -(b-a^2)10^n + b-c = 0$ , which is a second degree linear equation, and the second degree in variable $10^n$ and its roots are, \n\n$\\frac{(b-a^2) \\pm \\sqrt{(b-a^2)^2 - 4(c-2a^2)(b-c)}}{2(c-2a^2)}*10^n$  \n\nIn order to have real solution, the discriminant, $(b-a^2)^2 - 4(c-2a^2)(b-c) \\geq 0$ in order to get the roots which are non-real, we set this expression to 0 to find the values of $a, b $ and $ c$ which in turn gives $2a^2 -

b = a^2$ by $10^{2n}$ and both sides of the equation $b \\cdot 10^n + c \\cdot 10^n = a^2 + 1$ by $10^n$, we have the equations $c \\cdot 10^{2n} - b \\cdot 10^{2n} = a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n}$ and $b \\cdot 10^{2n} + c \\cdot 10^{2n} = a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} + 10^{3n}$.\n\nStep 15: By subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $2(b \\cdot 10^{2n}) = 10^{3n} + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n}$.\n\nStep 16: Dividing both sides of this equation by $2 \\cdot 10^{2n}$, we get $b = \\frac{10^{3n} + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n}}{2 \\cdot 10^{2n}}$.\n\nStep 17: Now, let us replace $b$ with this expression in the equation $c - b = a^2$.\n\nStep 18: Now, we have the equation $c - \\frac{10^{3n} + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n}}{2 \\cdot 10^{2n}} = a^2$.\n\nStep 19: Multiply both sides of the equation $c - \\frac{10^{3n} + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n}}{2 \\cdot 10^{2n}} = a^2$ by $2 \\cdot 10^{2n}$.\n\nStep 20: Now, we have the equation $2 \\cdot 10^{2n}c - (10^{3n} + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n}) = 2 \\cdot 10^{2n} a^2$.\n\nStep 21: By subtracting $10^{3n}$ from both sides of this equation, we get  $2 \\cdot 10^{2n}c - a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} = 2 \\cdot 10^{2n} a^2$.\n\nStep 22: Now, let us subtract $2 \\cdot 10^{2n} a^2$ from both sides of this equation.\n\nStep 23: By doing so, we have the equation $2 \\cdot 10^{2n}c - a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} - 2 \\cdot 10^{2n} a^2 = 0$.\n\nStep 24: Now, let us subtract $2 \\cdot 10^{2n}c$ from both sides of this equation and replace $c$ with this expression in the equation.\n\nStep 25: Now, we have the equation $-2 \\cdot 10^{2n}c + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} + 2 \\cdot 10^{2n} a^2 = 0$.\n\nStep 26: Dividing both sides of this equation by $ - 2 \\cdot 10^{2n}$, we get $c - a^2 = \\frac{- 2 \\cdot 10^{2n} a^2}{- 2 \\cdot 10^{2n}}$.\n\nStep 27: Now, let us replace $c$ with this expression in the equation $c \\cdot 10^{2n} + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} = a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} + 10^{3n}$ and simplify this expression.\n\nStep 28:  Now, let us replace $c$ with $a^2 - \\frac{- 2 \\cdot 10^{2n} a^2}{- 2 \\cdot 10^{2n}}$ in the equation.\n\nStep 29: Now, we have the equation  $(a^2 - a^2) 10^{2n} + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} = a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} + 10^{3n}$.\n\nStep 30: Now, let us cancel out $10^{2n}$ from both sides of this equation.\n\nStep 31: By doing so, we have the equation $a^2 10^{2n} + a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} = a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} + 10^{3n}$.\n\nStep 32: Now, let us cancel out $a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n}$ from both sides of this equation.\n\nStep 33: By doing so, we have the equation $a^2 = a^2 + \\frac{ - a^2 10^{2n}}{a^2} + \\frac{ - 10^{3n}}{a^2}$\n\nStep 34: Now, let us replace $a^2$ with this expression in the equation.\n\nStep 35: Now, we have the equation $c = a^2 + \\frac{ - 10^{2n}}{1} + \\frac{ - 10^{3n}}{a^2}$.\n\nStep 36: Now, let us replace $a^2$ with $a^2$ in the equation $c = a^2 + \\frac{ - 10^{2n}}{1} + \\frac{ - 10^{3n}}{a^2}$\n\nStep 37: Now, let us replace $c$ with $a^2 + \\frac{ - 10^{2n}}{1} + \\frac{ - 10^{3n}}{a^2}$ in the equation $c - b = a^2$.\n\nStep 38: Now, we have the equation $a^2 + \\frac{ - 10^{2n}}{1} + \\frac{ - 10^{3n}}{a^2} - b = a^2$.\n\nStep 39: By subtracting $a^2$ from both sides of this equation, we get $a^2 + \\frac{ - 10^{2n}}{1} + \\frac{ - 10^{3n}}{a^2} - b",

  "correct_answer": "Observe $A_n = a(1 + 10 + \\dots + 10^{n - 1}) = a \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$; similarly $B_n = b \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ and $C_n = c \\cdot \\tfrac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}$. The relation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$ rewrites as\\[c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = a^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\right)^2.\\]Since $n > 0$, $10^n > 1$ and we may cancel out a factor of $\\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ to obtain\\[c \\cdot (10^n + 1) - b = a^2 \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}.\\]This is a linear equation in $10^n$. Thus, if two distinct values of $n$ satisfy it, then all values of $n$ will. Now we plug in $n=0$ and $n=1$ (or some other number), we get $2c - b = 0$ and $11c - b= a^2$ . Solving the equations for $c$ and $b$, we get\\[c = \\frac{a^2}{9} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c - b = -\\frac{a^2}{9} \\implies b = \\frac{2a^2}{9}.\\]To maximize $a + b + c = a + \\tfrac{a^2}{3}$, we need to maximize $a$. Since $b$ and $c$ must be integers, $a$ must be a multiple of $3$. If $a = 9$ then $b$ exceeds $9$. However, if $a = 6$ then $b = 8$ and $c = 4$ for an answer of $\\boxed{18}$.",
