    "To find the number of clever integers divisible by 27, we need to determine all possible clever integers first. Then we can determine how many of those are divisible by 27. \n\nStep 1. Possible range of numbers: 22 to 118.\n\nStep 2: We will determine all numbers between 22 to 118 whose sum of digits is 9.\n\nStep 3: We then find those numbers that also are divisible by 27.\n\nStep 4: Last, we will determine the fraction. \n\nStep 1: Determine the range of possible number between 22 to 118.\n\nStep 2: Here are some integers whose digits sum to 9: \n1. 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.\nHowever we know the integer must be greater than 20 and less than 120.\n\nWe can filter these numbers to get integers in the specified range.\n\nFiltered: 36, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117. \n\nWe know that 27, 45 and 81, and 117 are all not greater than 20 or less than 120. However we also know 36 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117. 81 and 117 are not divisible by 27 between 22 and 118. Since 108 is divisible.  so 108 is in our list (i.e a clever integer). we can get that. \n\nStep 3: Determine the number of clever integers between 22 and 118. \nThere are 8 numbers left after removing those between 22 and 118. between 22 and 118. Here are some integers divisible by 27: 27, 54, 81, 108 , 27 and 81 are not between 22 to 118. Thus the only number is 54. \nHowever 54  is not between 22 and 118. \nSo we remove that one as well but 108 is. thus our number is 108. \n\nStep 4: Filter other number that are in the possible number between 22 to 118. Then we find those numbers that also are divisible by 27. Our number is 1.\n\nThe fractions of the number of integers that are divisible by 27 to all are:\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{1 / 8}.$",
    "To find the clever integers, we need to consider even numbers between 20 and 120 such that the sum of their digits is 9.\n\nFirst, let's list the possible sums of digits that are equal to 9: 0+9=9, 1+8=9, 2+7=9, 3+6=9, 4+5=9, 5+4=9, 6+3=9, 7+2=9, 8+1=9, 9+0=9.\n\nHowever, the integer must be even so we can remove the following: 0+9=9, 1+8=9, 2+7=9, 3+6=9, 5+4=9, 7+2=9, 8+1=9 because they do not meet the criteria of being even.\n\nNow, let's list the even numbers that are between 20 and 120 such that the sum of their digits is 9: 27 is not even, 36 is even, 45 is not even, 54 is even, 63 is not even, 72 is even, 81 is not even, 90 is even, 108 is even.\n\nThese are the even numbers that satisfy the conditions of being a clever integer: 36, 54, 72, 90, 108.\n\nNow, let's find which of these numbers are divisible by 27: 27 is not even, so it is not divisible by 27. 36 is divisible by 27 (36 = 2 * 18, and 18 is divisible by 9 and 2). 54 is divisible by 27 (54 = 2 * 27). 72 is not divisible by 27. 90 is not divisible by 27. 108 is divisible by 27 (108 = 4 * 27).\n\nTherefore, we have 2 numbers (36, 54, 108) that are divisible by 27 out of 5 numbers.\n\nNow, let's find the fraction of all clever integers that is divisible by 27:\n\nFraction = Number of clever integers that are divisible by 27 / Total number of clever integers.\nFraction = 3/5.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{3/5}$.",
    "To find the fraction of clever integers that are divisible by 27, we first need to find all the clever integers.\n\nA clever integer is an even integer greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9.\n\nLet's list out the possible clever integers:\n\n1. 27 + 9 = 36  - But 36 is not even. So, we can ignore this number.\n2. 28 + 8 + 0 = 36 - But 36 is not greater than 20. On the other hand, since we initially found a possible number that did not meet the numbers conditions, there will be a number 27 + 9 = 36. This is an exception since we had initially cut out 36 from consideration.  Since 27 + 9 > 27 numbers do not exist.
