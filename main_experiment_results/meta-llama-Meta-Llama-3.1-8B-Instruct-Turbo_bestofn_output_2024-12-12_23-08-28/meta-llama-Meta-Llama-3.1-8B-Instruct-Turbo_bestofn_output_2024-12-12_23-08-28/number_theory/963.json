    "To find the common terms, first, we need to find the formulas for the arithmetic progressions. \n\nFor the first arithmetic progression, let's first find the common difference (d1). We can do this by subtracting the first term from the second term: \nd1 = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nThe formula for an arithmetic progression is given by: \nan = a1 + (n-1)d\n\nwhere an is the nth term, a1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference.\n\nFor the first arithmetic progression, the formula is: \nan = 2 + (n-1)3\n\nFor the second arithmetic progression, let's find the common difference (d2). We can do this by subtracting the first term from the second term: \nd2 = 10 - 3 = 7\n\nThe formula for the second arithmetic progression is: \nan = 3 + (n-1)7\n\nNow, we need to find the common terms that belong to both arithmetic progressions. To do this, we equate the formulas and solve for n:\n\n2 + (n-1)3 = 3 + (n-1)7\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides: \n(n-1)3 = 1 + (n-1)7\n\nSubtract (n-1) from both sides: \n3 = 1 + 7(n-1) - (n - 1)\nSubtract 1 from both sides: \n2 = 7(n-1) - (n - 1)\nTake out (n - 1) from left side of equation: \n2 = (n - 1)(7 - 1)\nSubtract 1 from both sides: \n(n - 1)6 = 2\nDivide both sides by 6: \n(n - 1) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3\nn = (1 + 1) / 3 = 1 /3 + 1 = 4/3 \nBecause we're dealing with natural numbers, we need an integer answer for n. However, the answer requires us to multiply both sides by 3, which gives us: \n3n - 3 = 2 * 3  \n3n - 3 = 6  \n3n = 9  \nDividing by 3: \nn = 3\n\nHowever, this is a problem because we're trying to find how many terms are common in a specific number. Using the equation a = 2 + (n-1)3 and substituting n = 4/3 we get an = 2 + 3(4/3 -1). It doesn't make sense because we're using a non-integer as n.\n\nTry a different approach.\n\nSince a2 = 5 = 2 + 3 and a3 = 8 = 2 + 6, we see that all terms in the first sequence are congruent to 2 modulo 3. Similarly, since a2 = 10 = 3 + 7 and a3 = 17 = 10 + 7, we see that all terms in the second sequence are congruent to 1 modulo 3. Therefore all common terms must be congruent to 2 modulo 3.\n\nAlso, a2 = 5 = 10 - 5 and a3 = 8 = 17 - 9. Therefore all common terms must be congruent to 5 modulo 7.\n\nNow, a2 = 5 = 10 + 3 - 5 and a3 = 8 = 17 + 3 - 11. Therefore all common terms must be congruent to 3 modulo 6.\n\nWe have three simultaneous congruences:\n\na \u2261 2 (mod 3)\na \u2261 5 (mod 7)\na \u2261 3 (mod 6)\n\nUsing the Chinese Remainder theorem, we find that the common terms are given by a = 3 + 42k.\n\nNow, we need to find the largest value less than 500. Plug in different values of k into 3 + 42k, and we get: \n\n3 + 42 * 1 = 45\n3 + 42 * 2 = 87\n3 + 42 * 3 = 129\n3 + 42 * 4 = 171\n3 + 42 * 5 = 213\n3 + 42 * 6 = 255\n3 + 42 * 7 = 297\n3 + 42 * 8 = 339\n3 + 42 * 9 = 381\n3 + 42 * 10 = 423\n3 + 42 * 11 = 465\n3 + 42 * 12 = 507\n\nWe need an answer that's less than 500. Therefore, the largest value less than 500 that they have in common is: \n\n$\\boxed{465}$",
    "To find the common values, let's first list the terms of the two arithmetic progressions.\n\nThe first arithmetic progression is: \n2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 56, 59, 62, 65, 68, 71, 74, 77, 80, 83, 86, 89, 92, 95, 98, 101, 104, 107, 110, 113, 116, 119, 122, 125, 128, 131, 134, 137, 140, 143, 146, 149, 152, 155, 158, 161, 164, 167, 170, 173, 176, 179, 182, 185, 188, 191, 194, 197, 200, 203, 206, 209, 212, 215, 218, 221, 224, 227, 230, 233, 236, 239, 242, 245, 248, 251, 254, 257, 260, 263, 266, 269, 272, 275, 278, 281, 284, 287, 290, 293, 296, 299, 302, 305, 308, 311, 314, 317, 320, 323, 326, 329, 332, 335, 338, 341, 344, 347, 350, 353, 356, 359, 362, 365, 368, 371, 374, 377, 380, 383, 386, 389, 392, 395, 398, 401, 404, 407, 410, 413, 416, 419, 422, 425, 428, 431, 434, 437, 440, 443, 446, 449, 452, 455, 458, 461, 464, 467, 470, 473, 476, 479, 482, 485, 488, 491, 494, 497\n\nThe second arithmetic progression is:\n3, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 52, 59, 66, 73, 80, 87, 94, 101, 108, 115, 122, 129, 136, 143, 150, 157, 164, 171, 178, 185, 192, 199, 206, 213, 220, 227, 234, 241, 248, 255, 262, 269, 276, 283, 290, 297, 304, 311, 318, 325, 332, 339, 346, 353, 360, 367, 374, 381, 388, 395, 402, 409, 416, 423, 430, 437, 444, 451, 458, 465, 472, 479, 486, 493.\n\nTo make it easier, let's use a formula to find the nth term of each arithmetic sequence: \n\nFirst sequence:\nan = 2 + (n-1) * 3\n\nSecond sequence:\nbn = 3 + (n-1) * 7\n\nTo find the common term, we need to find values of n for both sequences such that an = bn. \n\nan = bn can be written as: \n2 + (n-1)3 = 3 + (n-1)7\nSubtracting 2 and (n-1)3 from both sides gives: \n0 = 1 + 4(n-1)\n-1 = 4(n-1)\nDividing by -4 gives:\n1/4 = n - 1\nAdding 1 to both sides gives: \n1 + 1/4 = n \nn = 5/4 \n\nn cannot be a fraction since we are trying to find a term of an arithmetic sequence. So we are looking for the smallest values of n that make both sequences equal. One option is to let n be a multiple of the least common multiple of the two sequences, which is 12. \n\nLet n = 12m for some integer m.\n\nFirst sequence: \nan = 2 + (12m-1) * 3\nFirst sequence = 2 + 36m * 3 \nFirst sequence = 2 + 108m\n\nSecond sequence: \nbn = 3 + (12m-1) * 7\nSecond sequence = 3 + 84m * 7 \nSecond sequence = 3 + 588m\n\nFirst sequence = Second sequence \n2 + 108m = 3 + 588m \n\nSubtracting 108m from both sides gives: \n2 = 3 + 480m \n\nSubtracting 3 from both sides gives: \n-1 = 480m \n\nDividing by -480 gives:\n1/480 = m \n\nLet m = 480p for some integer p.\n\nFirst sequence: \nan = 2 + 108(480p)\nFirst sequence = 2 + 51840p \n\nSecond sequence: \nbn = 3 + 588(480p)\nSecond sequence = 3 + 282240p \n\nTo find the largest value of the two sequences that is less than 500, we want to maximize m and p, so we find the largest integer p that makes both sequences less than 500.\n\n51840p < 500\np < 500/51840\np < 9.657 * 10^(-6) \n\np must be an integer, so the largest value of p that makes the inequality true is p = 0.\n\nFirst sequence: \nFirst sequence = 2 + 51840 * 0 \nFirst sequence = 2 \n\nSecond sequence:\nSecond sequence = 3 + 282240 * 0 \nSecond sequence = 3 \n\nThe common terms are 2, 5, 8, 11, and so on.

We know that \\begin{align*}\na&\\equiv 2\\pmod 3\\\\\na&\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer such that $a=2+3n$. Substituting this into $(2)$ yields \\[2+3n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 5\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $5$. Then $n\\ge 5\\implies a=2+3n\\ge 17$. $17$ satisfies the original congruences, so it is the smallest common term. Subtracting $17$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align*}\na-17&\\equiv -15\\equiv 0\\pmod 3\\nonumber\\\\\na-17&\\equiv -14\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\\nonumber\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,7)$, we get $a-17\\equiv 0\\pmod{3\\cdot 7}$, that is, $a\\equiv 17\\pmod{21}$.\n\nSo all common terms must be of the form $17+21m$ for some non-negative integer $m$.
