    "To find the solution to $(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5$, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: $6 + 1 - 4$\n   - $6 + 1 = 7$\n   - $7 - 4 = 3$\n\n   So now the equation is $(21 \\div 3) \\cdot 5$\n\n2. Evaluate the division: $21 \\div 3$\n   - This is equal to $\\frac{21}{3}$ which simplifies to $7$\n\n   Now the equation is $7 \\cdot 5$\n\n3. Multiply: $7 \\cdot 5$\n   - This equals $35$\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{35}$.",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct in their approach and final answer. However, I will analyze them for clarity, conciseness, and adherence to mathematical principles.\n\nSolution 1 and Solution 3 are very similar and provide a detailed step-by-step breakdown of the problem. However, Solution 2 is more concise and directly applies the order of operations (PEMDAS) without unnecessary elaboration.\n\nSolution 1 mentions breaking down the problem step by step, but it doesn't explicitly follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). Solution 3 explicitly follows the order of operations but is a bit wordy in its explanation.\n\nSolution 2 is the most concise and directly applies the order of operations, making it the most straightforward and efficient solution.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 2",
  "correct_answer": "Recall that expressions within parentheses should be done first. In the inner set of parentheses, we have $6+1-4=3.$ So, the outer set of parentheses can be rewritten as $21\\div3=7.$ Finally, \\[(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5=7\\cdot5=\\boxed{35}.\\]",
