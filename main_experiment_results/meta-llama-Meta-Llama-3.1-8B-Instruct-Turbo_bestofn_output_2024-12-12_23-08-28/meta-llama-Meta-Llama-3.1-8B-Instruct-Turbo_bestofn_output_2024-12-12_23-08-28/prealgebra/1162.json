    "To find the minimum number of dimes Chloe must have, let's calculate how much money she already has and then see how much more she needs.\n\nShe has three $\\$10$ bills, which is $3 \\times 10 = \\$30$.\n\nShe has eight quarters, and each quarter is worth $\\$0.25$. So, the total value of the quarters is $8 \\times 0.25 = \\$2$.\n\nNow, let's add the value of the bills and the quarters: $30 + 2 = \\$32$.\n\nShe still needs $\\$0.75$ to pay for the hoodie. This is where the dimes come in.\n\nEach dime is worth $\\$0.10$. To find the minimum number of dimes, we need to divide the remaining amount ($\\$0.75$) by the value of each dime ($\\$0.10$).\n\n$0.75 \\div 0.10 = 7.5$\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a dime, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure she has enough. \n\n$\\boxed{8}$",
    "To find the minimum number of dimes needed, we need to calculate how much money Chloe already has and subtract it from the price of the hoodie.\n\nChloe has:\n- 3 $10 bills = 3 x $10 = $30\n- 8 quarters = 8 x $0.25 = $2\n- A pile of dimes (unknown amount)\n\nTotal money Chloe has = $30 + $2 = $32\n\nThe price of the hoodie = $32.75\n\nChloe is short $0.75 ($32.75 - $32 = $0.75). This amount needs to be covered by the pile of dimes.\n\nOne dime is worth $0.10. To find the minimum number of dimes needed, we divide the shortage by the value of one dime:\n\nMinimum number of dimes = $0.75 / $0.10\nMinimum number of dimes = 7.5\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a coin, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Chloe has enough money.

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They all arrive at the same answer, which is that Chloe needs at least 8 dimes to pay for the hoodie.\n\nHowever, I would recommend Solution 1 as the best solution. It is more detailed and provides a clear explanation of each step. The use of a variable to represent the value of each dime makes the calculation more straightforward and easier to understand.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is: 1",
  "correct_answer": "Let $n$ represent the unknown number of dimes. Chloe's total amount of money is $$3(\\$10)+8(\\$.25)+n(\\$.10) \\ge \\$32.75.$$Simplifying gives  \\begin{align*}\n30+2+.10n &\\ge 32.75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\n.10n &\\ge .75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge \\frac{.75}{.10} \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge 7.5.\n\\end{align*}Chloe must have at least $\\boxed{8}$ dimes in her pile.",
