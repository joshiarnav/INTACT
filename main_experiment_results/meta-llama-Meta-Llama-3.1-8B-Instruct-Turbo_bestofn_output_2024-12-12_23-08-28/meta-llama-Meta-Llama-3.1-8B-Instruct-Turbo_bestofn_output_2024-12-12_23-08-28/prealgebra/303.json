  "problem": "What is the 20th digit after the decimal point of the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$?",
  "all_solutions": [
    "To find the decimal equivalents, we first need to convert the fractions into decimals.\n\n$\\frac{1}{7}$ = 0.142857142857... (repeat the block 142857)\n\n$\\frac{1}{3}$ = 0.333333333333... (repeat the block 3)\n\nNow, let's add the two decimals together:\n\n0.142857142857... + 0.333333333333...\n\nNotice that the block '142857' is a six-digit repeating block. To add the two decimals, we'll add the blocks separately. \n\nSince we are looking for the 20th digit, we'll need to find out how many times the six-digit block '142857' will repeat before the 20th digit, and the remaining digits. \n\nLet's divide 20 by 6 (the length of the repeating block):\n\n20 / 6 = 3 remainder 2\n\nThis means that the block '142857' will repeat three times, and there will be two digits remaining. \n\nThe three repeating blocks '142857' are:\n\n142857142857142857142857\n\nNow, let's add the remaining two digits (3 from the second decimal) to the end of this repeating block:\n\n14285714285714285714285733\n\nSince we added a 3 at the end, the first digit of the remaining two will be 4 (which is the first digit of the repeating block), and the second digit will be 3. \n\nTherefore, the 20th digit after the decimal point is 3.",
    "To find the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, we need to convert them to decimals.\n\n1. To convert $\\frac{1}{3}$ to decimal:\n$\\frac{1}{3} = 0.\\overline{3}$\nThe bar over the 3 indicates that the 3 is repeating.\n\n2. To convert $\\frac{1}{7}$ to decimal:\n$\\frac{1}{7} = 0.\\overline{142857}$\nThe bar over the 142857 indicates that this sequence is repeating.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the decimal equivalents for $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. When we add the repeating decimals:\n\n0.142857 (1/7) plus 0.3 (1/3) \nThe sequence in 1/7 is six digits, and the repeating decimal for 1/3 is only one digit. We can find a repeating decimal sequence for 1/3 by using a repeating decimal sequence of 1/3 that is six digits long.\n\nThe sequence for 1/3 is 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 which is 3 * six which is eighteen plus 3 which is 21 divided by six. Therefore this is 3.5. This is 3 plus a half. Adding this to 0.142857 we get this sequence: \n0.142857 plus 3.5 is 4.142857.\n\nNow, to find the twentieth digit after the decimal point of the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, we need to count the digits after the decimal point.\n\nThe sum is 4.142857 (repeating sequence). Let's list the sequence:\n\n4.142857142857142857...\n\nCounting the digits, we get this:\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20.\n\nThe twentieth digit after the decimal point is 8.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{8}$",
    "To find the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, we first need to convert them to decimals.\n\n$\\frac{1}{7} = 0.\\overline{142857142857...}$\n$\\frac{1}{3} = 0.\\overline{3}$\n\nNow, we need to add these two decimals together.\n\nSince $\\frac{1}{3} = 0.\\overline{3}$, when we add it to $\\frac{1}{7}$, the repeating pattern of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is unchanged.\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{3} = 0.\\overline{142857142857...} + 0.\\overline{3}$.\n\nNow, let's simplify the sum. \n\nFirst, we can observe that when the 0.\\overline{3} is added to the repeating 142857 pattern, the repeating blocks after four digits are merged when 142857 + 3 merged will cause an extra three merged which gives an extra three in the sum which takes up an extra three spaces within four which causes the pattern to move up one position in the merged blocks, in the merged blocks four really takes up the merged

  "critique": "Solution 1 is correct.

  "correct_answer": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$, and that of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $0.\\overline{3}$. The first has a repeating block of 6 digits and the second has a repeating block of 1 digit, so we believe the repeating block of the sum will have 6 digits and try adding the first 6 digits of each decimal representation.  $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}& & &. &1 & 4 & \\stackrel{1}{2} & 8 & \\stackrel{1}{5} & 7\\\\& +& &. &3 &3 & 3 & 3& 3 & 3\\\\ \\cline{1-9} & & & .& 4 &7 & 6 & 1 & 9 & 0\\\\ \\end{array} $$ Notice that continuing the addition past the first six digits will result in repeating blocks of the same six digits ($.142857+.333333=.476190$), so the decimal representation of the sum is $0.\\overline{476190}$. Since 20 divided by 6 has a remainder of 2, the 20th digit following the decimal point is the same as the second digit following the decimal point, which is $\\boxed{7}$.",
