    "To find the area of $S'$, we first need to find the determinant of the given matrix. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix \\[\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}\\] is given by $ad - bc$. \n\nHere, $a = 2$, $b = -1$, $c = 7$, and $d = 2$. So, the determinant of the given matrix is $(2)(2) - (-1)(7) = 4 + 7 = 11$.\n\nNow, we know that when a matrix is applied to a region, the area scales by a factor equal to the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix. In this case, the area of $S'$ will be the area of $S$ scaled by a factor of $|11| = 11$.\n\nSince the area of $S$ is $4$, the area of $S'$ will be $4 \\cdot 11 = 44$.\n\nTherefore, the area of $S'$ is $\\boxed{44}$.",
