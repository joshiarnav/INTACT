    "To find the image of $2i$ under the dilation, we'll first need to find the vector from the center to the point $2i$. This vector is given by $(2i - (-1 + 4i)) = (2i + 1 - 4i) = (1 - 2i)$.\n\nNow, we multiply this vector by the scale factor, $-2$: $-2(1 - 2i) = -2 + 4i$.\n\nTo find the final image of $2i$, we need to add the scaled vector to the center: $(-1 + 4i) + (-2 + 4i) = -1 - 2 + 4i + 4i = -3 + 8i$.\n\nTherefore, the image of $2i$ is $\\boxed{-3 + 8i}$.",
    "To find the image of $2i$ under the dilation with scale factor $-2$ and center $-1 + 4i,$ we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the vector from the center of dilation to the point being dilated ($2i$). \n   This vector can be represented as $(2i) - (-1 + 4i) = 1 - 2i.$\n\n2. Dilate the vector by the scale factor $-2.$\n   Multiplying the vector $1 - 2i$ by the scale factor $-2,$ we get $(-2)(1 - 2i) = -2 + 4i.$\n\n3. Add the result of step 2 to the center of dilation to find the image of $2i.$\n   Adding the vector $-2 + 4i$ to the center $-1 + 4i,$ we get $(-1 + 4i) + (-2 + 4i) = -3 + 8i.$\n\nTherefore, the dilation takes $2i$ to $\\boxed{-3 + 8i}$.",
    "To find the complex number that $2i$ is mapped to under the given dilation, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract the center of dilation from the given point to find the vector from the center to the point. This gives us a vector from $-1+4i$ to $2i$:\n   \\[ (2i) - (-1+4i) = (2i) + (1-4i) = 1-2i \\]\n\n   So the vector from the center of dilation to $2i$ is $1-2i$.\n\n2. Since we're dilating with a scale factor of $-2$, we need to multiply this vector by $-2$:\n   \\[ -2(1-2i) = -2 + 4i \\]\n\n   This gives us the direction in which the point needs to be moved from the center of dilation, with a scale factor of $-2$.\n\n3. Now we need to add this scaled vector back to the center of dilation to find the final image of $2i$. This gives us:\n   \\[ (-1 + 4i) + (-2+4i) = -3+8i \\]\n\n   So the complex number that $2i$ is mapped to under the dilation is $\\boxed{-3+8i.}$"
