    "To find the value of $x$ such that the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$ are orthogonal, we'll use the property that two vectors are orthogonal if and only if their dot product is 0.\n\nThe dot product of two vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix}$ is defined as $ac + bd$.\n\nSo, the dot product of the given vectors is $(2)(x) + (5)(-3)$.\n\nTo find when the vectors are orthogonal, we set the dot product equal to 0:\n\n$2x - 15 = 0$\n\nNow, we can solve for $x$:\n\n$2x = 15$\n\n$x = \\frac{15}{2}$\n\nSo, the value of $x$ such that the vectors are orthogonal is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{15}{\uff12}}$",
