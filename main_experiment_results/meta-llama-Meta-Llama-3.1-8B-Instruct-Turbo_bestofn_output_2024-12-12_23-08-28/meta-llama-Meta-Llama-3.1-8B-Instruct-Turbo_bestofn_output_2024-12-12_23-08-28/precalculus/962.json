    "To find $\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right),$ we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Recall that the tangent function is periodic with a period of $\\pi.$ \n2. In the given expression, $-\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$ is in the third quadrant.\n3. To simplify the given expression, we can use the property that $\\tan \\left( - \\theta \\right) = -\\tan \\theta.$\n4. Since the tangent function has a period of $\\pi,$ we can express $-\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$ as $\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\pi$ and use the periodicity property.\n5. However, a more straightforward approach would be to use the reference angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n6. The tangent function at a reference angle $\\theta$ is given by $\\tan \\theta$ if the angle is in the first quadrant.\n7. In the third quadrant, the tangent function is negative.\n\nUsing the reference angle approach:\n\nWe know that $\\tan \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) = 1,$ and since $\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) = -\\tan \\left( \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right)$ and $\\tan \\left( \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) = \\tan \\left( \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right)$, and since the tangent function is negative in the third quadrant, we can calculate $\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right)$ as follows:\n\n$$\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) = -\\tan \\left( \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) = -1 \\cdot (-1) = \\boxed{1}.$$",
    "To find $\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right)$, we can use the trigonometric identity that relates the tangent function to the sine and cosine functions:\n\ntan(x) = sin(x) / cos(x)\n\nThe angle $-\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$ is in radians. We can convert it to degrees by multiplying by $\\frac{180}{\\pi}$:\n\n$-\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\cdot \\frac{180}{\\pi} = -135^{\\circ}$\n\nSince tangent is an odd function, we can write:\n\ntan(-\u03b8) = -tan(\u03b8)\n\nSo, we can rewrite the original problem as:\n\ntan(-135\u00b0) = -tan(135\u00b0)\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the tangent function has a period of 180\u00b0:\n\ntan(135\u00b0) = tan(45\u00b0 + 90\u00b0) = tan(45\u00b0) / cos(90\u00b0)  (since cos(90\u00b0) = 0)\n\nHowever, to simplify the process, we'll make use of the properties of the trigonometric functions in the unit circle - given that sin(135\u00b0) = cos(45\u00b0), then cos(135\u00b0) = -sin(45\u00b0).\n\nsin(45\u00b0) = cos(45\u00b0) = $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and cos(45\u00b0) = sin(45\u00b0) = $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\ncos(135\u00b0) = -sin(45\u00b0) = -$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\ntan(135\u00b0) is undefined in the real numbers because it's cos(135\u00b0) = 0. However, we can find its value using the following trigonometric identities:\ntan(135\u00b0) = cot(45\u00b0) - cot(45\u00b0) = cot(45\u00b0)/cot(45\u00b0) - cot(45\u00b0)\ntangent has a period of 180\u00b0, therefore \ntan(45\u00b0 + 180\u00b0) = tan(225\u00b0) = -1 \n\nHere we made use of -tan(45\u00b0 + 180\u00b0) because 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 360\u00b0. \nA 180\u00b0 rotation of angles produces a sign change. \n\nSo now we have \ntan(135\u00b0) = -tan(45\u00b0 + 90\u00b0) = -(-1) \n\nTherefore \ntan(-135\u00b0) = tan(225\u00b0 - 180\u00b0) = -1",
    "To find $\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right),$ we can use the fact that the tangent function is periodic with a period of $\\pi.$ \n\nFirst, we need to convert $-\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$ to a corresponding angle in the interval $[0, 2\\pi).$\n\nSince $-\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$ is in the third quadrant and is equivalent to the angle $\\frac{3\\pi}{4}$ which in standard position is in the first quadrant, but with a change of sign due to the negative in front of the pi. So we calculate that minus pi is equivalent to pi radians, minus the other pi we had, three pi by 4. We find $\\frac{9 \\pi}{4}$ which is in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$. But that is two periods past our target so is in the same location as our initial $\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$. Our solution is equivalent to minus $\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$ the equivalent positive angle is three pi by 4.\n\nWe use the fact that $\\tan(\\theta) = -\\tan(-\\theta)$ for all angles.\n\nSince we now know $\\tan(\\frac{3\\pi}{4})$, we know that $\\tan(-\\frac{3\\pi}{4}) = - \\tan(\\frac{3\\pi}{4})$\n\nSince $\\tan(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}) = -1$\n\n$\\tan(-\\frac{3\\pi}{4}) = - \\tan(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}) = -(-1) = 1$\n\nSo $\\boxed{1}.$"
