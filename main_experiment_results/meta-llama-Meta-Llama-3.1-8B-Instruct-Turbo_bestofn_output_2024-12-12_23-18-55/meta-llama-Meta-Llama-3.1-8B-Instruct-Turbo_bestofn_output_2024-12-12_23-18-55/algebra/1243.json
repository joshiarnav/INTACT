    "To evaluate the expression $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}$, we need to use the properties of the imaginary unit $i$. \n\nWe know that $i^2 = -1$, $i^3 = -i$, $i^4 = 1$, and this cycle repeats.

    "To evaluate the expression $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}$, let's break down each term by expressing it in terms of the cyclical nature of powers of the imaginary unit $i$. Recall that $i^2 = -1$, $i^3 = -i$, $i^4 = 1$, and this pattern repeats every four powers.\n\n1. $i^{11}$: Since $i^4 = 1$, we can divide the exponent by 4 to get the remainder. $11 \\mod 4 = 3$, which means $i^{11} = i^3 = -i$.\n\n2. $i^{16}$: When dividing the exponent by 4, we get $16 \\mod 4 = 0$, which means $i^{16} = (i^4)^4 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n3. $i^{21}$: Dividing the exponent by 4 gives $21 \\mod 4 = 1$, which means $i^{21} = i^1 = i$.\n\n4. $i^{26}$: Dividing the exponent by 4 gives $26 \\mod 4 = 2$, which means $i^{26} = i^2 = -1$.\n\n5. $i^{31}$: Dividing the exponent by 4 gives $31 \\mod 4 = 3$, which means $i^{31} = i^3 = -i$.\n\nNow, we add the results of all terms: $-i + 1 + i - 1 - i$.\n\nSimplifying this expression:\n\\[\n-i + i = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n1 - 1 = 0\n\\]\nThis means that the final answer is $0$. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"

  "solution": "We know that by definition, $i^2=-1$, so $i^4=(-1)^2=1.$ More generally, for all integers k, $i^{4k}=(i^4)^k=1^k=1$.
