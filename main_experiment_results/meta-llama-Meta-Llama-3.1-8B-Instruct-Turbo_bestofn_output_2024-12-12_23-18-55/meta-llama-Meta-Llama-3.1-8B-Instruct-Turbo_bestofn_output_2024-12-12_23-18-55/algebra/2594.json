    "To find the first term of the geometric sequence, we can use the ratio of consecutive terms to set up an equation. \n\nLet's denote the first term as 'a' and the common ratio as 'r'. \n\nThe third term of the sequence is 12, so we can write it as: \nar^2 = 12 \n\nThe fourth term of the sequence is 16, so we can write it as: \nar^3 = 16 \n\nNow, let's divide the second equation by the first: \n(r^3)/(r^2) = 16/12 \nr = 8/6 \nr = 4/3 \n\nNow that we have the common ratio 'r', we can substitute it back into one of the equations to find the first term 'a'. Let's use the first equation: \nar^2 = 12 \na(4/3)^2 = 12 \na(16/9) = 12 \na = 12 * (9/16) \na = 108/16 \na = 27/4 \n\nSo, the first term of the sequence is $\\boxed{27/4}$.",
    "Let's break it down step by step.\n\nGiven: The third term of a geometric sequence (let's call it a) is 12, and the fourth term is 16.\n\nIn a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a common ratio (r).\n\nSo, the relationship between the third and fourth terms can be expressed as:\n \nFourth term = Third term \u00d7 r\n16 = 12 \u00d7 r\n\nTo find the common ratio (r), we divide 16 by 12:\nr = 16 / 12\nr = 4/3\n\nNow that we have the common ratio, we can find the second term by dividing the third term by the common ratio (r):\nSecond term = Third term / r\nSecond term = 12 / (4/3)\nSecond term = 12 \u00d7 (3/4)\nSecond term = 36/4\nSecond term = 9\n\nSimilarly, we can find the first term (let's call it b) by dividing the second term by the common ratio (r):\nb = Second term / r\nb = 9 / (4/3)\nb = 9 \u00d7 (3/4)\nb = 27/4\n\nSo, the first term of the sequence is 27/4.\n\nIn the required format:\n$\\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$",
    "To find the first term of a geometric sequence, we need to find the common ratio and then work backwards.\n\nGiven:\n- The third term (t3) is 12\n- The fourth term (t4) is 16\n\nThe formula for a geometric sequence is an = ar^(n-1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.\n\nWe can find the common ratio (r) by dividing any term by the previous term. In this case, we can divide the fourth term by the third term:\n\nr = t4 / t3 = 16 / 12 = 4/3\n\nNow that we know the common ratio, we can use it to find the second term, then the first term. \n\nThe second term (t2) is found using the third term and the common ratio. We can use the formula an = ar^(n-1), rearranging for t2 = t3 * (r^(-1)) = t3 * (1/r):\n\nt2 = t3 * (1/r) = 12 * (1/(4/3)) = 12 * 3/4 = 9\n\nNow that we have the second term, we can use the same formula to find the first term. We can use the formula an = ar^(n-1), rearranging for a = t2 * r^(1):\n\na = t2 * r^(1) = 9 * (4/3) = 12\n\nThe first term (a) is 12.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{12}$."

  "critique": "Let's analyze each solution for correctness:\n\nSolution 1: This solution is correct.

  "solution": "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence. Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$. Solving, we have $a\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",
