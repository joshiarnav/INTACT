    "To find the value of $a$, we can use the given vertex and the point the parabola passes through. \n\nSince the vertex is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic can be written in vertex form as $y = a(x + 4)^2$. \n\nWe know the parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$. So, we substitute $x = 1$ and $y = -75$ into the equation:\n\n-75 = a(1 + 4)^2\n\nNow, we can simplify and solve for $a$:\n\n-75 = a(5)^2\n-75 = 25a\n\nTo find the value of $a$, divide both sides by 25:\n\na = -75/25\na = -3\n\nSo, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{-3}$.",
    "To solve for $a$, let's start by using the information given about the vertex. The vertex form of a parabola is $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex. Given that the vertex is $(-4,0)$, we can write the equation of the parabola as:\n\n$$y = a(x-(-4))^2 + 0$$\n\n$$y = a(x+4)^2$$\n\nNow, we can plug in the point $(1,-75)$ to find the value of $a$. Substituting $x=1$ and $y=-75$, we get:\n\n$$-75 = a(1+4)^2$$\n\n$$-75 = a(5)^2$$\n\n$$-75 = 25a$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $a$:\n\n$$a = \\frac{-75}{25}$$\n\n$$a = -3$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{-3}$.",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They all arrive at the same answer, $a = -3$. However, Solution 1 and Solution 2 have some minor formatting issues, but the steps are clear and correct.\n\nSolution 3 is the most concise and has the cleanest formatting, making it the best solution.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is: $\\boxed{3}$",
  "solution": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic must be of the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$.  The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, which gives us the equation $-75 = 25a$.  Hence, $a = -75/25 = \\boxed{-3}$.",
