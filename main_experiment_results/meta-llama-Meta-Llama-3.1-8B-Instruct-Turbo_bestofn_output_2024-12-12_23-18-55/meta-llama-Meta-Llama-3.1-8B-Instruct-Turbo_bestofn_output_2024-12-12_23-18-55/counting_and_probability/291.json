    "To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the values of $7!$ and $(5!)^2$. \n\n1. $(5!)^2$ equals $5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$ which simplifies to $(5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1)^2$ or $5! \\times 5!$. Writing it out in full form: \n\n$(5\\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1) \\times (5\\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1)$\n\n$= 5! \\times 5!$\n\n\n2. $7!$ is equal to $7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$\n\nNow let's simplify the expression. Observe that $7!$ can be written as $(5! \\times (7 \\times 6))$. Similarly, $5!$ can be written as $(5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1)$.\n\nTherefore, we can rewrite both $7!$ and $5! \\times 5!$ in terms of $5!$. So we have:\n\n$7! = 5! \\times (7 \\times 6)$ and $5! \\times 5! = (5! \\times 5!)$. \n\nTo find the greatest common divisor, it should be evident that $5!$ is a common divisor. So we need to factorize the remaining part of the $7!$ expression and check divisibility against both components of $5! \\times 5!$. Since $5! \\times 5!$ contains two $5!$ and we are not left with multiple \"5!s\" it can be factored for only one. Since the prime factorization \"7 $\\times$ 6\" will only contribute to $6$ and $7$ because these primes never get repeated - we can proceed.\n\nUpon inspection, we can also see that both $5!$ and $5! \\times 5!$ are divisible by $5!$. Now we need to check whether $6 \\times 7$ share any common factors with $5!$. Obviously, it does not. Hence the greatest common divisor is just our remaining component of $5!$.\n\n\nNow we have \"5! $\\times$ 5!\" and \"7 $\\times$ 6\". There are 5! in our \"5! $\\times$ 5!\" expression. The expression  \"7 $\\times$ 6\" does not contribute the remaining \"5!\". So it must be the greatest common divisor that is left out. The greatest \"5!\" expression is left out of the entire $7 \\times$ 6 \"5 $\\times$ 4 $\\times$ 3 $\\times$ 2 $\\times$ 1\" expression because \"7 $\\times$ 6 \" does not contain any more than just a 2 $\\times$ 3 $\\times$ 5. Therefore the leftover common factors is what we have left in \"5\". Since we know the final product of the left over amount is \"5!\", our final remaining number is \"5!\" - The greatest common divisor our numbers have in common is \"5! $\\times$ 1\". Just like \"7 $\\times$ 6\".  That is equal to a \"720 $\\times$ 1\". That = 720"

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I can confirm that all three solutions are correct and arrive at the same answer, which is 720.\n\nHowever, I would select Solution 2 as the best solution. This is because Solution 2 clearly and concisely explains the process of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) using prime factorization, and it presents the solution in a clear and organized manner.\n\nSolution 1 and Solution 3, while correct, are slightly more verbose and could be improved in terms of clarity and concision. Solution 3, in particular, has some awkward phrasing and sentence structure that makes it harder to follow.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is:\n\n2",
