    "To find the number of ways Karl can select four crayons, we can use the concept of combinations. \n\nSince the order doesn't matter, we're essentially choosing a subset of 4 crayons from a total of 12. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (12 crayons), r is the number of items to choose (4 crayons), and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nFirst, we need to find the factorial of 12:\n12! = 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n\nNow, we need to find the factorial of 4:\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n\nAnd the factorial of (12-4), which is 8:\n8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the combination formula:\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4!(12-4)!)\n= (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n= (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n= 495\n\nSo, there are 495 ways for Karl to select four crayons if the order in which he draws them out does not matter.\n\n$\\boxed{495}$",

    "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of combinations. Combinations are used when the order of selection does not matter.\n\nThe formula for combinations is given by:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items being chosen.\n\nIn this case, we have 12 different-colored crayons (n = 12) and Karl is selecting 4 crayons (r = 4).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the factorial of the total number of items:\n12! = 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1\n= 479,001,600\n\nNext, let's calculate the factorial of the number of items being chosen:\n4! = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1\n= 24\n\nNow, let's calculate the factorial of the difference between the total number of items and the number of items being chosen:\n(12-4)! = 8! = 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1\n= 40,320\n\nNow we can plug these values into the combination formula:\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4!(12-4)!)\n= 479,001,600 / (24 \u00d7 40,320)\n= 479,001,600 / 967,680\n= 494\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a combination, our final answer is a whole number.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways Karl can select four crayons if the order does not matter is:\n\n$\\boxed{494}$"

  "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last.
