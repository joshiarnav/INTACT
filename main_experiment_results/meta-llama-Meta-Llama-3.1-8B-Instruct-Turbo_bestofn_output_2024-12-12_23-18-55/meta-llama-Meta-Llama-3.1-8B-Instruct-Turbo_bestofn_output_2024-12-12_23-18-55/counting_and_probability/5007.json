    "To find the largest 2-digit prime factor of $n = {200\\choose 100}$, we need to calculate this binomial coefficient.\n\nFirst, we can express the binomial coefficient as:\n\n$n = {200 \\choose 100} = \\frac{200!}{100! \\cdot 100!}$\n\nHowever, calculating this directly would be computationally intensive. Instead, we can apply the property of factorials that $n! = n \\cdot (n-1)!$. This allows us to write:\n\n$n = \\frac{200 \\cdot 199 \\cdot 198 \\cdot \\dotsm \\cdot 101 \\cdot 100!}{100! \\cdot 100!}$\n\nCanceling out the common factors of $100!$, we get:\n\n$n = \\frac{200 \\cdot 199 \\cdot 198 \\cdot \\dotsm \\cdot 101}{100 \\cdot 99 \\cdot \\dotsm \\cdot 1}$\n\nThis expression is a product of consecutive integers, which can be simplified using the properties of factorials.\n\nNext, we can express $n$ as a product of prime factors. We start with the highest factors, which are $200 \\cdot 199 = 39800 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 199$, and so on.\n\nHowever, since we want the largest 2-digit prime factor, we should try to break down the expression into more manageable parts.\n\nWe can express the product of consecutive integers as:\n\n$200 \\cdot 199 \\cdot 198 \\cdot \\dotsm \\cdot 101 = 200 \\cdot (200-1) \\cdot (200-2) \\cdot \\dotsm \\cdot (200-99)$\n\nThis product has fewer factors of $2$, so we can look for larger prime factors.\n\nNow we will express $n$ as the product of $200$, and the product of the remaining numbers:\n\n$n = 200 \\cdot [(200-1) \\cdot (200-2) \\cdot \\dotsm \\cdot (200-100)]$",
    "To solve this problem, we first need to recall the formula for combinations, which is given by:\n\n$\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$.\n\nApplying this formula to the given problem, we have:\n\n$\\binom{200}{100} = \\frac{200!}{100!100!}$.\n\nNoting that the value of 200! can be broken down into factors of prime numbers, we will look for the largest 2-digit prime factor of the integer $n = \\binom{200}{100}$.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the equation. \n\n$\\binom{200}{100} = \\frac{200 \\cdot 199 \\cdot 198 \\cdot 197 \\cdots 151 \\cdot 150}{100 \\cdot 99 \\cdots 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}$.\n\nNow let's consider the prime factorization of the number $\\binom{200}{100}$. The prime factorization will include all prime factors from 200, 199, 198, etc., down to 3. Since the value of n will include 100!,  it will also have 2 as a factor 100 times from this factor, from 50, 49, 48, etc. down to 2.\n\nNow, considering only two-digit prime factors, we can look at the prime factors of the value $\\frac{200 \\cdot 199 \\cdot 198 \\cdot 197 \\cdots 51}{100}$. Notice that 199, 197, 191, 181, 179, 173, 167, 163, 157, 149, 151 are all prime numbers less than 200, which could still potentially be factors of $\\binom{200}{100}$.\n\nThe two-digit prime factors in the expression $\\binom{200}{100}$ will be from 199 to 97. \n\nNow, if there are two-digit prime factors in $100!$, then they must be 101 or smaller, however any prime numbers smaller or equal to 100 are not divisible by 101.\n\nUpon checking numbers from 199 to 97, we see that the greatest two-digit prime factor of $200\\choose{100}$, will be $\\boxed{97}$",
    "To find the largest 2-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$, we need to understand the concept of combinations and factorials.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of ${200\\choose 100}$. \n\nThe combination formula is given by: \n${n\\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n${200\\choose 100} = \\frac{200!}{100!(200-100)!} = \\frac{200!}{100!100!}$\n\nSimplifying this, we can write:\n${200\\choose 100} = \\frac{200\\times199\\times\\cdots 101}{100\\times99\\times\\cdots\\times1}$\n\nNotice that the numerator of this fraction has a lot of factors that are repeated in the denominator, so we can simplify even further:\n${200\\choose 100} = \\frac{200\\times199\\times\\cdots\\times(101+99)}{100\\times99\\times\\cdots\\times(50+49)} = \\frac{200\\times199\\times\\cdots\\times199}{100\\times99\\times\\cdots\\times98}$\n\nThis tells us that the factors in the numerator and the denominator are almost the same, with a lot of factors of 99, 98, etc.\n\nThis shows us that the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$ will be divisible by many numbers, in particular several two-digit primes.\n\nLet's consider some of these factors. We know that this number $n$ is divisible by $99=3^2\\cdot 11$, and also by $98=2\\cdot 7^2\\cdot 11$.\n\nHowever, since $11$ is a prime factor, it will not be able to cancel out. Therefore, multiplying these together, we have that \n$n$ is divisible by $1332 = 2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 7^2\\cdot 11.$\n\nTo find the largest 2-digit prime factor of $n$, we need to divide $n$ by this number and look at the remainder.\n\nAfter doing the division, we find that $n$ is not equal to $1332$ times any integer, and looking at the remainder, we find that $n \\equiv 8 \\pmod{1332}$.\n\nHowever, we are only interested in finding the largest 2-digit prime factor of the integer $n$, and we notice that $1981$ is a prime number of the form $1332k + 8$.\n\nHence, the integer $1981$ is a 2-digit prime factor of the integer $n$.\n\nHowever, the question was asking for 2-digit prime, since 1981 is a 3 digit prime,  we will test the two digit primes up to 99 for divisibility.\n\nThe largest 2-digit prime factor is $\\boxed{89}$"

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I found that Solution 2 is the best solution. \n\nSolution 1 is incorrect because it doesn't provide a clear and efficient way to find the largest 2-digit prime factor.\n\nSolution 3 is also incorrect because it incorrectly concludes that 1981 is a 2-digit prime factor, and then tests other 2-digit primes for divisibility.\n\nSolution 2, on the other hand, correctly identifies the prime factors of the binomial coefficient and finds that the largest 2-digit prime factor is 97.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is:\n\n1",
  "solution": "Expanding the binomial coefficient, we get ${200 \\choose 100}=\\frac{200!}{100!100!}$. Let the required prime be $p$; then $10 \\le p < 100$. If $p > 50$, then the factor of $p$ appears twice in the denominator. Thus, we need $p$ to appear as a factor at least three times in the numerator, so $3p<200$.
