    "To find the probability that the result is a composite number, we'll use the complementary probability approach.\n\nA composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. On the other hand, a non-composite number (or a prime) is a positive integer that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\n\nFirst, let's consider the scenarios where the product is not composite: \n1. At least four dice show a 1, and the fifth die shows either a 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n2. All dice show a 1.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of outcomes when rolling 5 standard 6-sided dice. Since each die has 6 sides and we are rolling 5 dice, the total number of outcomes is $6^5 = 7776$.\n\nLet's consider the first case: \n- There are 4 ways to choose which die shows the number 1 (e.g., die 1 is 1). For each of these cases, there are 10 options for the remaining dice to be any of 2, 3, or 5. There are also $4^4$ ways to map the numbers 2, 3, or 5 to the remaining 4 dice.\nHowever, this method of counting includes cases where all dice show a 1 as well as cases with a 2, 3, or a 5 on two dice, a 3 on three dice, etc.",
    "To find the probability that the result is a composite number when rolling 5 standard 6-sided dice and multiplying the numbers on the faces, we can first find the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nEach die has 6 possible outcomes, so when rolling 5 dice, the total number of outcomes is 6^5 = 7776.\n\nNow, let's find the number of outcomes where the product is not a composite number, i.e., the number is prime. \n\nFor this to happen, at least 4 dice must show a 1, and the remaining die must show either a 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\nWe can count the number of ways to choose which die shows the 1 and 2/3/5 as follows:\n- If the die showing the product is 2, 3, or 5, the number of ways for this to occur is 5 (there are 5 options for which die to choose) times 3 (the chosen die can be 2, 3, or 5) times 5^4 (for the other four dice, any of the five outcomes are possible).\n- However, this counts all instances where one of those dice is 1 as well, so we need to eliminate those instances by multiplying by (5^4 - 1) and then multiply by 4 because there are four different options of which die to choose.\n- If the dice showing the product is 1, the number of ways for this to occur is 5 (for the chosen die) times 6^4 (for the other four dice) because any outcome is possible.\n\nThis sums up to 4*5*3 * (5^4) + 5 * (5^4 - 1) + 5 * (6^4) = 4 * 3125 * 3 + 5 * 9375 + 5 * 46656 \n= 46875 * 4 + 46875 + 233280\n= 187500 + 46875 + 233280 \n= 375855.\n\nNow, if we find the number of ways that a non-composite number could occur (i.e., a prime number could occur) we can subtract it from the total number of outcomes to find the number of ways a composite number could occur.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of getting a composite number by dividing the number of ways to get a composite number by the total number of outcomes.\n\nThat number of ways to get a non-composite number (or prime number) is 375855.\nTherefore, the number of ways to get a composite number would be 7776 - 375855 =  369621.\n\nHence, the probability of getting a composite number is (369621 / 7776).\n(369621 / 7776) = 47.5%",
    "To find the probability that the product of the five dice is a composite number, we can find the probability that it is not and then subtract it. \n\nStep 1: Let's consider the cases when the product of the five dice is not a composite number.\n\nFor a composite number, at least three of the factors (die values) must be greater than 1. Thus, to calculate the probability that it is not, we have two cases. The product of the five dice is 1 or the product of the five dice has fewer than three factors greater than 1.\n\n**Case 1: All the numbers on the dice are 1**\n\nThe only way the product will not be a composite number is if all the numbers on the dice are 1. There is exactly 1 outcome that meets this condition: (1,1,1,1,1).\n\n**Case 2: Exactly one die is not a 1**\n\nThere are $\\binom{5}{1}=5$ ways to choose one of the dice to be not a 1. For the 4 other dice, they must be 1. There are $1^4=1$ way for all the other dice to be 1. For the selected die, there are 5 ways to get a number greater than 1. Therefore, the total number of outcomes that meet this condition is $5\\cdot5=25$.\n\n**Case 3: Exactly two dice are not 1**\n\nThere are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which two dice are not 1. For the 3 other dice, they must be 1. There are $1^3=1$ way for all the other dice to be 1. For the pair of selected dice, there are $5^2=25$ ways to get a number greater than 1. Therefore, the total number of outcomes that meet this condition is $10\\cdot25=250$.\n\n**Case 4: Exactly three dice are not 1**\n\nThere are $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways to choose which three dice are not 1. For the 2 other dice, they must be 1. There is $1^2=1$ way for all the other dice to be 1. For the trio of selected dice, there are $5^3=125$ ways to get a number greater than 1. For the selected three dice, let's call them $x$, $y$, and $z$, and their prime factorization $x=p_1^{a_1}$, $y=p_2^{a_2}$, $z=p_3^{a_3}$. Then we have $xyz=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}p_3^{a_3}$. To satisfy $p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}p_3^{a_3}$ to be not composite, we would require at least 4 of $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$ to be 1, which contradicts with our premise that $x$, $y$, $z$ are not 1. Therefore, there are no valid outcomes for this case.\n\nNow let's use the Inclusion-Exclusion principle to find the probability of a product that is not composite. There are $6^5=7776$ total possible outcomes, as each of the 5 dice has 6 possible values (1 through 6).\n\n$|A\\triangle B|=|A|$\n$|A\\triangle (B\\triangle C)|=|A|$\nas set $A$ is the set of all products that are 1 and set $B$ and $C$ are the sets of products where exactly one pair of dice is not 1, and where two pairs of dice are not 1, respectively.\n\nThus, the probability that the product of the five dice is a composite number is $\\frac{7776-26-250+0}{7776} =\\boxed{\\frac{7700}{7776}}$"

  "solution": "While it is almost tempting to make this into the casework problem to end all casework problems, using complementary probability makes the problem a lot simpler, so we will find the probability that the product is not composite.\n\nIt's clear that if more than one die shows a roll greater than 1, the resulting product will have more than one factor that is greater than 1 and therefore be composite. Additionally, if any of the dice show a 4 or a 6, the product will obviously be composite. So in order for the product to not be composite, we need at least four dice to be a 1 and the fifth die to either be another 1 or a 2, a 3, or a 5.\n\nThere's exactly one way in which all the the dice can be 1's, and for each of the other three cases there are 5 ways since the die that isn't a 1 can appear in any of the 5 other positions, so there are a total of $3\\cdot5+1=16$ ways of rolling the dice that result in a product that isn't composite. Additionally, there are 6 options for the roll of each of the 5 dice for a total of $6^5=7776$ possible outcomes, which means that the probability of the product not being composite is $\\dfrac{16}{7776}$ and the probability that it is composite is $1-\\frac{16}{7776}=\\frac{7760}{7776}=\\boxed{\\frac{485}{486}}$.\n\nNote: Many students have tried to argue that 1 is not a prime number and should not be counted. As we are doing complementary probability, it is important to consider all numbers that are not composite, and 1 is definitely not composite.",
