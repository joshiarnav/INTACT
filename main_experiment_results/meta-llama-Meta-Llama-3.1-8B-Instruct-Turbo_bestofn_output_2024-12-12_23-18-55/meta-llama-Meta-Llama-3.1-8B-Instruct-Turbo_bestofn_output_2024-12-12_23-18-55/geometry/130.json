    "We first note that $\\angle P + \\angle Q + \\angle R = 180^\\circ.$ From the given, we have $\\angle P = 63^\\circ$ and $\\angle Q = 59^\\circ.$ Therefore, $\\angle R = 180^\\circ-63^\\circ-59^\\circ = 58^\\circ.$\n\nNext, we see that quadrilateral $PQCR$ is cyclic.

Using the fact that $CPP'R$ is a cyclic quadrilateral and $\\angle PPC' = 90^\\circ$, we can deduce that $\\angle QCR$ is an exterior angle of $CPP'R$. Therefore, we can use the fact that the sum of exterior angles of a polygon is equal to $360^\\circ$ to write that the angle sum for the cyclic quadrilateral is $360^\\circ$.  Let $x$ be the measure of  $\\angle PPC'$ (which equals $\\angle QCP'$) which in turn equals  $180^\\circ-59^\\circ-58^\\circ=63^\\circ$, which in turn is also equal to the angle measure of $\\angle RQC'$ and $\\angle XCR$.

    "To find $\\angle QRC$, let's first find $\\angle PRQ$ using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$.\n\n$\\angle PQR = 63^\\circ$ and $\\angle QPR = 59^\\circ$, so \n\n$\\angle PRQ = 180^\\circ - (63^\\circ + 59^\\circ) = 180^\\circ - 122^\\circ = 58^\\circ$\n\nSince line $PR$ is tangent to the circle at point $R$, angle $\\angle QRC$ must be equal to $\\angle QRP$, due to the properties of tangent lines to circles.

    "To find $\\angle QRC$, we can start by finding the measure of $\\angle QCR$. We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$.\n\nConsidering triangle $PQR$, we have:\n\n$$\\angle PQR + \\angle QPR + \\angle QRP = 180^\\circ$$\n\nWe are given that $\\angle PQR = 63^\\circ$ and $\\angle QPR = 59^\\circ$. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n$$63^\\circ + 59^\\circ + \\angle QRP = 180^\\circ$$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we have:\n\n$$122^\\circ + \\angle QRP = 180^\\circ$$\n\nSubtracting $122^\\circ$ from both sides, we find:\n\n$$\\angle QRP = 58^\\circ$$\n\nNow, we can see that line $CR$ is the bisector of angle $\\angle QRP$. This is a property of the incenter in a triangle as the intersection of the angle bisectors. \n\nTherefore, triangle $QRC$ is isosceles, and we know that the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal. This means that:\n\n$$\\angle QCR = \\angle CRC$$\n\nNow we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$. \n\nWe know that $\\angle QRC = 180^\\circ - \\angle QCR - \\angle CRC$. We also know that $\\angle QCR + \\angle QRP = 180^\\circ - \\angle QCR$, and noting that $\\angle QRP$ is equal to $58^\\circ$ from previous results we can find that $\\angle QCR = 116^\\circ - \\angle CRC$. And because of that we know that:\n\n$$\\angle QRC = 180^\\circ - \\angle QCR - \\angle CRC$$\n\n$$\\angle QRC = 180^\\circ - (116^\\circ - \\angle CRC) - \\angle CRC$$\n\n$$\\angle QRC = 180^\\circ - 116^\\circ + \\angle CRC - \\angle CRC$$\n\n$$\\angle QRC = 64^\\circ$$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$\\boxed{\\angle QRC = 64^\\circ}$."
