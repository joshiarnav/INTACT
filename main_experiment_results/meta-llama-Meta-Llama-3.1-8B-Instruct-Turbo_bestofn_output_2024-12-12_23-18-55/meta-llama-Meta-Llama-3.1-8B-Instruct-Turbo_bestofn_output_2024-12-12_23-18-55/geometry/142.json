    "To compute $\\sin 60^\\circ$, let's use the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Draw a 30-60-90 right triangle with an angle of $60^\\circ$ and an opposite side length of 1 (one unit). The adjacent side of the triangle is $\\sqrt{3}$ units, and the hypotenuse is 2 units.\n\nStep 2: Recall the definition of the sine function: it is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.\n\nStep 3: Calculate $\\sin 60^\\circ$ by dividing the length of the opposite side (1) by the length of the hypotenuse (2).\n\n$\\sin 60^\\circ = \\frac{opposite}{hypotenuse} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nTherefore, $\\sin 60^\\circ = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "To compute $\\sin 60^\\circ$, we'll use the unit circle, which is a circle with a radius of 1 centered at the origin of a coordinate plane. \n\n1. Draw the unit circle and locate the point 60 degrees counterclockwise from the point (1, 0). This is the point (x, y) where we want to find the sine value.\n\n2. Since 60 degrees is in the first quadrant (where both x and y are positive), we can use special triangles to find the coordinates of the point.\n\n3. Draw a line from the point (0, 0) to the point (1, 0) and another line from (0, 0) to the point (x, y). The line from (0, 0) to (1, 0) is the x-axis, and the line from (0, 0) to (x, y) is a line segment that forms a 30-60-90 triangle with the x-axis.\n\n4. The 30-60-90 triangle has side ratios that are well-known. If the side opposite the 30-degree angle is 1 unit (the side adjacent to the 60-degree angle, i.e., the x-coordinate), then the side opposite the 60-degree angle is $\\sqrt{3}$ units (the y-coordinate).\n\n5. Given this, we know that $\\sin 60^\\circ$ is the y-coordinate of the point (x, y), which is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.",
    "To compute $\\sin 60^\\circ$, we can use the unit circle or a trigonometric identity. \n\nStep 1: Recall the unit circle, where the angle $60^\\circ$ is located in the first quadrant. The point on the unit circle that corresponds to $60^\\circ$ has coordinates $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$.\n\nStep 2: The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. Here, the opposite side is the y-coordinate of the point on the unit circle, and the hypotenuse is the radius of the unit circle, which is 1.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, the sine of $60^\\circ$ is the y-coordinate of the point on the unit circle, which is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nSo, $\\sin 60^\\circ = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$."

  "critique": "The best solution is 3.\n\nSolution 1 contains an error in the length of the hypotenuse of the 30-60-90 triangle, which is actually $\\sqrt{3}$, not 2.\n\nSolution 2 is correct in using the unit circle, but it introduces unnecessary complexity by drawing lines and using special triangles.\n\nSolution 3 is the most straightforward and correct solution, using the unit circle and the definition of the sine function.",
