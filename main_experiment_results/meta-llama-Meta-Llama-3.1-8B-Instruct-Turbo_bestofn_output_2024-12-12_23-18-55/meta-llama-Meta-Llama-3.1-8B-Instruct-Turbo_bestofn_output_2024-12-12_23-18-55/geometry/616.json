    "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to find the largest possible value of \\(x\\).\n\nThe triangle inequality theorem states that in a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nUsing this theorem, we have the following three inequalities for the sides of the triangle:\n\n1. \\(5 + 6 > x\\) \n\\(11 > x\\) or equivalently, \\(x < 11\\)\n\n2. \\(5 + x > 6\\)\n\\(x > 1\\)\n\n3. \\(6 + x > 5\\)\n\\(x > -1\\)\n\nThese inequalities tell us that the possible range for \\(x\\) is from 2 to 10 (inclusive), since \\(x\\) has to be an integer.\n\nHowever, we need to find the largest possible value of \\(x\\) that still satisfies all the inequalities from the triangle inequality theorem. Considering the simplest and most relevant inequality from our perspective: \\(11 > x\\)  \nTherefore, the largest value of \\(x\\) we can select is \\(x = 10\\).\n\nUsing perimeter formula for a triangle: \\(P = a + b + c\\), in this case:\n\n\\(P = 5 + 6 + 10\\)\n\\(P = 21\\) units.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{21}$.",
    "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to follow the triangle inequality theorem. \n\nThe triangle inequality states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.\n\nGiven a triangle with sides of length 5 and 6 units, let's say the third side has length $x$. \n\nAccording to the triangle inequality theorem:\n\n- The sum of the lengths of the two known sides (5 and 6) must be greater than the length of the third side ($x$): \n  $5 + 6 > x$\n  \n- The sum of the length of the third side ($x$) and the length of one of the known sides must be greater than the length of the other known side:\n  $5 + x > 6$\n  $x + 6 > 5$\n\n- The sum of the lengths of the two unknown sides (one of which is $x$) must be greater than the length of the third known side:\n  $x + 6 > 5$\n  $x + 5 > 6$\n\nSimplifying the inequalities, we get:\n\n- $11 > x$\n- $x > 1$\n- $x > -1$ \n\nSince we are dealing with lengths, $x > -1$ is not a valid inequality in this context.\n\nThe valid range of $x$ satisfying all other inequalities is ($x$ between 2 and 10 inclusive).\n\nTo maximize the perimeter, we need to choose the largest value of $x$ within this range, which is 10.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum perimeter. The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all three sides: $5 + 6 + 10$.\n\nMaximum perimeter = $5 + 6 + 10 = 21$\n\nSo, the largest possible perimeter of the triangle is $\\boxed{21}$.",
    "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to find the largest possible value of the third side, x.\n\nAccording to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nLet's consider the three possible cases for the value of x:\n\n1. Case 1: 5 > x\nSince x - 6 must be greater than 0 (or x > 6), this is not possible because x cannot be a 3 digit number.\n\n2. Case 2: x + 6 > 5 \nThis simplifies to x > -1. Since x cannot be negative, we cannot get the largest perimeter using this case.\n\n3. Case 3: x + 5 > 6 \nThis simplifies to x > 1\n\n4. Case 4: 5 + 6 > x\nThis simplifies to 11 > x \n\nBy combining Case 3 and Case 4, we find that 1 < x < 11.\n\nSince we're looking for the largest possible value of x (which will give us the largest possible perimeter), we take the maximum value of x to be 10 (which is an integer).\n\nSo, the largest possible perimeter is 5 + 6 + 10 = 21.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible perimeter of the triangle is $\\boxed{21}$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct in their analysis and conclusion that the largest possible perimeter of the triangle is 21 units.\n\nHowever, Solution 1 is the most straightforward and concise, and it directly addresses the problem by applying the triangle inequality theorem to find the range of x and then selecting the largest possible value of x.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",
