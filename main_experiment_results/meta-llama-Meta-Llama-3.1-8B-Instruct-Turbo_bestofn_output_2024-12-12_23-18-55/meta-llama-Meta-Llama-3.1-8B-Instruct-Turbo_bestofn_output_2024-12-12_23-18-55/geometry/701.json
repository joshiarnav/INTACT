    "To find the area of the regular octagon, we can start by finding the area of square $BDEF$ and then subtract the areas of the four right triangles outside the octagon.\n\nFirst, we need to find the area of square $BDEF$.  Since $BDEF$ is a square, its area is the square of the length of its side, which is $BD$ in this case.  From the diagram, we can see that $BD = DE + EF + FB = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.\n\nHowever, the diagram shows $BD$ to be $2 + \\sqrt{2}$ so that must be used in this solution.\n\nThus, the area of square $BDEF$ is $(2 + \\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 + 4 \\sqrt{2} + 2 = 6 + 4 \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow, we can find the areas of the four right triangles outside the octagon.  These triangles are all congruent, so it suffices to find the area of one of them.  They each have base $1$ and height $2 + \\sqrt{2} - 1 = \\sqrt{2} + 1$.\n\nThus, the area of one right triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} (1) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\sqrt{2} + 1) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nThe area of the right triangle is larger than that now we know that the area of one right triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} (1) (2+\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n\nThere are four right triangles outside the octagon, so the total area of all four of them is $4 \\left(\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = 2(2 + \\sqrt{2}) = 4 + 2 \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFinally, we can find the area of the octagon by subtracting the total area of the right triangles from the area of the square.  This gives $6 + 4 \\sqrt{2} - (4 + 2 \\sqrt{2}) = 2 + 2 \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the area of the regular octagon is $\\boxed{2 + 2\\sqrt{2}}$ square units.",
    "To find the number of square units in the area of the regular octagon, we first need to understand the given diagram and identify the shapes involved.\n\nGiven that $BDEF$ is a square, we know that $BDEF$ has four equal sides and four right angles.

Both of these triangles are isosceles right triangles since their two shorter sides are of equal length (1 in this case) and the angle between them is a right angle.\n\nGiven the information provided about triangle AHD and triangle ABC, we know the area of each of these two triangles because for an isosceles right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ (of length 1 here) the area $A$ is $(1/2)ab$, or $(1/2)1*1$, which simplifies to (1/2).\n\nSince we have 4 isosceles right triangles (two sets of two triangles) within the square BDEF that form the sides of the square BDEF we also know the total area of the square BDEF is equal to the area of its defining triangles (as shown in the figure) but because we have 4 of these triangles that form the square BDEF, the area of the square BDEF must be (4 * (1/2)) or 2 square units.\n\nThe area of the square can be calculated as the length of one side squared.

    "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  Divide the Octagon into a square and 4 right-angled triangles.\n2.  Find the area of the square.\n3.  Find the area of one right-angled triangle.\n4.  Find the total area of the right-angled triangles (4 triangles).\n5.  Subtract the total area of the right-angled triangles from the total area of the square.\n\nFirst, we note that to get the area of a square, we must know its side length. We note that side lengths are AB, BC, and CD at 1.  However, to find the area of the octagon, we must first find the area of the square and then subtract the area of  four triangles with height of $1$ and base of $\\sqrt{2}$ so we need to divide them into easy parts. \n\nWe know that the legs of these triangles are 1 and 1, so we can find the hypotenuse by using the formula for the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle.\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2, \\ \\ \\text{and so we have, } \\]\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2, \\ \\ \\text{so } 1^2 + 1^2 = c^2, \\]\n\\[  2  = c^2 \\ \\ \\text{and so } c = \\sqrt{2}.\\]\n\nSince a square has the same side length on all sides, we can call its side length s.  So the area of this square is  $s^2$.  We know that $BC=1\\ \\ \\&\\ \\ CD = \\sqrt{2}$\nTherefore,\ns = $BC + CD$\n$\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  =  1 +  \\sqrt{2}$ \n\nNow we know that $s = 1 + \\sqrt{2}$\n\nWe know that $BDEF$ is a square and we know its side length is $(x + s)$, so the area of the square is $s^2$.\n\nSo, the area of $BDEF$ is  \n$(1 + \\sqrt{2})^2$.\nWe can solve this problem by plugging in $(1 +  \\sqrt{2})^2 = 3 + 2\\sqrt{2}$ for $s^2$:\n$(1 + \\sqrt{2})^2$\n$= 3 + 2 \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow we will find the area of the triangle to subtract.  We know the base and the height, so we can use this formula to find the area of the triangle.  \n$A = \\frac{b \\times h}{2}$\n$A = \\frac{ \\sqrt{2} \\times 1}{2}$\n$A = \\frac{ \\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n\nNow we know what the area of one right triangle is, so we will multiply it by 4 to get the total area of the right triangles:\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times 4$\n$= 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow we know the total area of the right triangles, so we can subtract it from the area of the square to find the area of the octagon:\n$3 + 2\\sqrt{2} - 2\\sqrt{2}$\n$= 3.$\n\nSo the area of the octagon is $ 3$ square units.\n\n$\\boxed{3}$"
