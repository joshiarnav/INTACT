    "We can express $a_2$ and $a_3$ as multiples of the first term $a_1 = 1$. In a geometric sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is proportional to the preceding term. So we can write:\n\n- $a_2 = a_1r$ where $r$ is the common ratio.\n- $a_3 = a_1r^2$ \n\nSubstituting the values of $a_1,$ $a_2,$ and $a_3$ into the expression:\n\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4(a_1r) + 5(a_1r^2)$\n$= 4r + 5r^2$\n\nNow we want to find the smallest possible value of this expression. To do this, we can take the derivative of the expression with respect to $r$ and set it equal to zero:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dr} (4r + 5r^2) = 0$\n$8r + 10r^2 = 0$\n\nDividing the equation by 2 and moving it to one side:\n\n$5r^2 + 4r = r(5r + 4) = 0$\n\nThe factors in this form (where factors multiply to give the original function) provide key values of r as potential solutions. Here r = 0 and $r = \\frac{-4}{5}$. The critical points of this function correspond to $r = 0,$ $ r = \\frac{-4}{5}$. We will combine these critical values into a list to check their potential effects.\n\n$\\left[-\\frac{4}{5}, 0\\right]$\n\nTo identify the minimum, we must check the second derivative and apply the test. We find $\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(4r + 5r^2\\right) = 8 + 10r$ which equals zero when $r = - \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\n$\\frac{d^2}{dr^2} (4r + 5r^2) = \\left(10r\\right)'_{r=-\\frac{4}{5}} = 10$\n\nSince the second derivative is positive at $r=-\\frac{4}{5}$, we can conclude that this is the minimum.\n\nNow, substitute $r = -\\frac{4}{5}$ into the expression $4r + 5r^2$:\n\n$4r + 5r^2$\n$= 4\\left(-\\frac{4}{5}\\right) + 5\\left(-\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2$\n$= -\\frac{16}{5} + \\frac{16}{5}$\n$=0.$ \n\nThe final answer is $0 = \\boxed{0}$.",
    "To find the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$, we can start by understanding the properties of a geometric sequence.\n\nA geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio ($r$). \n\nGiven that $a_1 = 1$, we can express the terms of the sequence as follows:\n\n$a_1 = 1$\n$a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r = 1 \\cdot r = r$\n$a_3 = a_2 \\cdot r = r \\cdot r = r^2$\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$. \n\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2$\n\nTo find the smallest possible value of $4r + 5r^2$, we can consider it as a quadratic equation in terms of $r$. The general form of a quadratic equation is $ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, and $x$ is the variable.\n\nIn our case, the quadratic equation is $5r^2 + 4r$. We can rewrite this equation by setting $a = 5$, $b = 4$, and $c = 0$.\n\nThe minimum value of a quadratic equation occurs when $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$.\n\n$r = -\\frac{4}{2 \\cdot 5} = -\\frac{4}{10} = -\\frac{2}{5}$\n\nNow, we can substitute $r = -\\frac{2}{5}$ into the equation $5r^2 + 4r$ to find the smallest possible value:\n\n$5r^2 + 4r = 5 \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 + 4\\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right)$\n$5r^2 + 4r = 5 \\left(\\frac{4}{25}\\right) - \\frac{8}{5}$\n$5r^2 + 4r = \\frac{20}{25} - \\frac{8}{5}$\n$5r^2 + 4r = \\frac{20}{25} - \\frac{40}{25}$\n$5r^2 + 4r = \\frac{-20}{25} = -\\frac{4}{5}$\n\nThe smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$ is $-\\frac{4}{5}$.",
