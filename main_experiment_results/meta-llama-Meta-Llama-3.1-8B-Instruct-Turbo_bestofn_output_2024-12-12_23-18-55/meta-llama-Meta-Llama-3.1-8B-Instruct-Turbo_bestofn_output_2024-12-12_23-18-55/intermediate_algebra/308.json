    "To find the set $S$, we need to find the values of $x$ for which $f_n(x) = x$ for some positive integer $n$.\n\nFirst, let's examine the given function $f(x) = \\frac{x + 6}{x}$. Since $f(x) = x$, we have $\\frac{x + 6}{x} = x$. This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and it has a repeated root, which is $x = -2$.\n\nWe can also observe that $f(-2) = \\frac{-2 + 6}{-2} = 2 = -2$. However, this is a special case, and we are looking for $x$ values that satisfy the equation $f_n(x) = x$ for some positive integer $n$.\n\nNow, let's consider the generic form of $f_n(x)$:\n\n\\[f_n(x) = \\frac{ax + b}{cx + d},\\]where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are constants that depend on the values of $x$ and the previous composition of $f_n(x)$.\n\nTo find the values of $x$ for which $f_n(x) = x$, we need to solve the equation:\n\n\\[\\frac{ax + b}{cx + d} = x.\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by $(cx+ d)$, we get:\n\n\\[ax + b = x(cx + d) = cx^2 + dx.\\]\n\nNow, we can rearrange the terms to obtain:\n\n\\[cx^2 + (d - a)x - b = 0.\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{- (d - a) \\pm \\sqrt{(d - a)^2 + 4bc}}{2c}.\\]\n\nHowever, we can still simplify this expression. \n\nSince the quadratic formula must have two distinct real solutions for the given function to equal $x$ for all $x = -2$, we know that:\n\n\\[(d- a)^2 + 4bc \\neq 0\\].\n\nHowever, since $(x- -2)$ will never be a solution, we can infer that:\n\n\\[-2 = \\frac{(2- -2) + \\sqrt{(-2)^2 +4(-3)(6)}}{2(-2)}\\].\n\nThis forces the expression to reduce to -2 with a specific case of a not equaling d and c being -2.",

    "Given the sequence $(f_n)$ of functions defined by $f_1 = f$ and $f_n = f \\circ f_{n - 1}$ for all $n \\ge 2$ where $f(x) = \\frac{x + 6}{x},$ we want to find the set $S$ of all real numbers $x$ such that $f_n(x) = x$ for some positive integer $n$ and determine the number of elements in $S.$\n\nStep 1: To find the numbers in $S$, we need to solve $f_n(x) = x.$ However, solving this equation directly for $n$ can be challenging. \n\nStep 2: Let's begin by solving $f(x) = x$, this will give us an initial set of numbers in $S$ and help us find a pattern for $f_n(x) = x.$ The equation $f(x) = x$ implies that\n\n\\[\\frac{x + 6}{x} = x.\\]\nThus,\n\n\\[x + 6 = x^2.\\]\n\nStep 3:\nThe equation from Step 2 is a quadratic equation and can be written as $x^2 - x - 6 = 0.$ We can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},\\]\n where $a = 1,$ $b = -1,$ and $c = -6.$\n\nStep 4: Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we obtain candidates for the solutions.

Let's check if these values satisfy $f_n(x) = x$ for a few positive integers $n.$\n\nStep 12: It can be verified that $f_2(3) = 3$ and $f_2(-2) = -2,$ so both $x = 3$ and $x = -2$ are in $S.$\n\nStep 13: However, we cannot have a third solution in $S.$ This is because a solution to $f_n(x) = x$ must satisfy $f(x) = x$ for some positive integer $n.$ If $x = a$ and $x = b$ are two distinct solutions in $S$ that satisfy $f_n(x) = x$ for some positive integers $n = m$ and $n = p$ respectively, this would imply that $f^m(a) = a$ and $f^p(b) = b.$ Since we show $f^2(a) = a$ and $f^2(b) = b$ for $a = 3$ and $b = -2$, we can conclude that every integer value of $p$ and every integer value of $m$ will have their own denominators to cancel out in the fraction $\\frac{b+6}{b}$, and that the numerator and denominator of $\\frac{b+6}{b}$ can be combined into a single term $b+6$, resulting in $f^p(b) = \\frac{b+6}{b} = b+1,$ but also $f^m(a) = \\frac{a+6}{a} = a+1.$ If $f^p(b) = f^m(a) = a+1,$ then we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{b+6}{b} &= a+1 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad b^2 + 6b &= ab + 6a + ab\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad b^2 - 6a - ab + 6b &= 0.\n\\end{align*}However, $a$ and $b$ cannot both have solutions where $a > -6$ and $b > -6$ (we have already established values for $a$ and $b$ as 3 and -2, a new one can't possibly satisfy both $f^m(a) = a+1$ and $f^p(b) = a$).\nAs a result, the fact that we must have both $b>3$ and $a<-6$ and the original two values of $a$ and $b$ already assigned as $3$ and $-2,$ respectively, the value of $f^{mn}(b) = f^{mn}(a) = a+1$ doesn't work and is eliminated as a possibility.\n\nStep 14: Conclusion: Therefore, the set $S$ contains exactly two elements, $\\boxed{2}$, namely 3 and -2."
