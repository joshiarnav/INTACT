    "To find the slant asymptote, we can divide the numerator by the denominator using long division or synthetic division. \n\nFirst, we divide $2x^2$ by $x$, which gives us $2x$.

  "solution": "To approach this problem, we can either use long division or synthetic division to evaluate the quotient of the given rational expression.
