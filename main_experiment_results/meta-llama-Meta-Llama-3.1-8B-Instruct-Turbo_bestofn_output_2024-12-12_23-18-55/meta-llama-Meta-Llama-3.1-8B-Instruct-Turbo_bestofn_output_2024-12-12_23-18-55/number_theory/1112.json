    "To find the value of $\\triangle$, we'll start from the rightmost column and work our way to the left. Since we're working in a base-6 number system, we'll make sure to carry over any groups of 6 when the sum exceeds 6.\n\nFrom the rightmost column, we can write the equation: $\\triangle + 0 + 2 \\equiv 1_6$. \n\nIn base 6, if the sum of two digits exceeds 6, we'd need to carry a value, but that's not the case here. This situation gives us that $\\triangle \\equiv 5_6$.",
    "To solve this problem, we will work from right to left, starting with the units column.\n\nIn the units column, we have the value of $\\triangle_6 + 2_6 = 1_6$. Since $\\triangle_6 + 2_6$ has a carry-through of $0$ (because the resulting sum is $1_6$), this means that we have $\\triangle + 2 = 1 + 6k$ in base $10$, where $k$ is the number of \"carries\". Since we only have a single carry-through, $k = 0$. Therefore, we have $\\triangle + 2 = 1$, or $\\triangle = -1$. However, since the digit $\\triangle$ must be between $0$ and $5$ (inclusive) because it is represented in base $6$, we conclude that the previous calculation is incorrect.\n\nSince $\\triangle + 2 = 1 + 6k$, we try $k = 1$, which gives $\\triangle + 2 = 7$. Subtracting $2$ from both sides gives $\\triangle = 5$.",
    "To find the value of $\\triangle$, we will analyze the problem step by step. Since it's a base-6 addition, we need to consider the carrying over that might occur due to this base-6 constraint.\n\nLooking at the rightmost column, $\\triangle + 0 + 2 = 1_6$. Since this sum also needs to be in base-6, let's consider the result of $1_6$. \n\nSince $\\triangle + 2$ gives a unit digit of 1 in base-6 addition, $\\triangle$ must be 5.  Therefore, $$\\triangle+2 \\equiv 1\\pmod{6}.$$ \nIf $\\triangle$ were any smaller number than 5, then the sum of $\\triangle + 2$ would have been less than 10, therefore, less than 6^2, which is 36 and smaller than 6^2 + 6 which is 42. That number which is  46.  However, 46 is not 1 more than a multiple of 6.\n\nAdding 2 to 5 gives 7 in base-10. To get the unit digit 1 in base-6, $\\triangle + 2$ must be one more than a multiple of 6. Therefore $\\triangle$ is either 5.\n\nNow, we must ensure that the sum $\\triangle + 4 + 5$ (from the second to the leftmost) does not have a carry over from the addition to the next column.\n\nThe sum $\\triangle + 4 + 5 = 14_6$. But this means 14 in base 6 is $\\triangle$ plus 4 and 5, or $\\triangle$ equals to 5."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct, but Solution 3 is the most straightforward and provides the most detailed explanation. However, Solution 1 is also correct and is a good example of how to handle base-6 arithmetic.\n\nSolution 2 is incorrect because it initially concludes that $\\triangle = -1$, which is not possible since $\\triangle$ must be a non-negative integer less than 6.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 3.",
  "solution": "We notice that in the units column, it's impossible for $\\triangle+2=1_6$. So, it must be the case that $\\triangle+2=11_6=7$. That would mean $\\triangle=7-2=\\boxed{5}$. We can check that our answer works by plugging our value for triangle into the original problem: $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & 3 & 2 & 1 & 5_6\\\\ & & & 5 & 4 & 0_6\\\\ &+ & & & 5 & 2_6\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & 4 & 2 & 5 & 1_6.\\\\ \\end{array} $$The addition problem still works, so our answer is correct.",
