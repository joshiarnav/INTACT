    "To find the residue of $182 \\cdot 12 - 15 \\cdot 7 + 3 \\pmod{14}$, we will evaluate it step by step.\n\nStep 1: Evaluate $182 \\cdot 12 \\pmod{14}$. Since $182 \\pmod{14} = 0$ (since $182$ is a multiple of $14$), we have $182 \\cdot 12 \\pmod{14} = 0 \\cdot 12 \\pmod{14} = 0$.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate $15 \\cdot 7 \\pmod{14}$. Since $15 \\pmod{14} = 1$ and $7 \\pmod{14} = 7$, we have $15 \\cdot 7 \\pmod{14} = 1 \\cdot 7 \\pmod{14} = 7$.\n\nStep 3: Now we can rewrite the original expression as $0 - 7 + 3 \\pmod{14}$. Subtracting $7$ and adding $3$ gives us $-4 \\pmod{14}$.\n\nStep 4: To ensure our answer is in the range $[0, 14)$, we add $14$ to both sides of the congruence to get $-4 + 14 \\pmod{14} = 10 \\pmod{14}$.\n\nSo, the residue of $182 \\cdot 12 - 15 \\cdot 7 + 111$ is not necessary as our value was derived with 3 as it was in the original expression.",
    "To find the residue of the given expression, we'll break it down step by step.\n\n1. First, we'll compute the products:\n   - $182 \\cdot 12 = 2184$\n   - $15 \\cdot 7 = 105$\n\n2. Then, we'll substitute these values into the original expression:\n   $2184 - 105 + 3$\n\n3. Now, we'll perform the operations:\n   $2184 - 105 = 2079$\n   $2079 + 3 = 2082$\n\n4. To find the residue modulo 14, we'll divide 2082 by 14 and find the remainder:\n   $2082 \\div 14 = 148$ (quotient)\n   $2082 - (148 \\cdot 14) = 2082 - 2072 = 10$\n\nSo, the residue of $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\pmod{14}$ is $\\boxed{10}$."

  "solution": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7. So the residue of the sum is  $$\n182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\equiv \\boxed{10} \\pmod{14}.\n$$",
