    "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we need to analyze the possible cases for the hundreds digit and then find the largest possible number.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the possibilities for the hundreds digit.\n\n- If the hundreds digit is 9, then the number must be divisible by 9. This means the sum of its digits must also be divisible by 9. This limits our possibilities significantly because the sum of the digits would have to include the distinct, non-zero digits that are less than 9.\n\nStep 2: Explore the hundreds digit as 9.\n\nThe sum of the other two digits must be divisible by 9 because the number is divisible by 9. Since the digits are distinct and non-zero, the only possibility for a number is to have a digit of 9 and the other digits that add to 0 to complete the divisibility by 9. The only two-digit number divisible by 9 and where digits are not 9 is 18.\n\nSo the potential largest numbers with the hundreds digit as 9 would be 9xy, where xy is 18.\n\nStep 3: Consider if the hundreds digit cannot be 9.\n\nIn this case, we consider numbers wxy, where w is distinct from x and y and w is not 9.\n\n- The sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 3 to ensure the number itself is divisible by 3.",
    "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we can start by considering the hundreds digit.\n\n1. The hundreds digit should be as large as possible. Since we need a three-digit integer, it can be 9. \n\n2. Next, we consider the tens and units digits. They must be distinct and non-zero, and the number must be divisible by each of these digits. \n\n3. For the number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by 9. \n\nLet's break it down further:\n\n- If the hundreds digit is 9, then the sum of the tens and units digits must be divisible by 9.\n- Additionally, the tens and units digits must be distinct and non-zero.\n- The number must also be divisible by the tens and units digits.\n\nStep-by-step possibilities for our tens and units digits, given that the number is divisible by 9:\n\n1. When the hundreds digit is 9, the tens digit must be a multiple of 3 to make the sum of the digits equal to 9. Also, the units digit has to be a distinctive non-zero digit and should make the sum of all three digits to be a multiple of 9.\n2. Another rule: Since 9 is a prime factor in some three-digit numbers, a number must be divisible by any other factors that it has (like 4, or 8) so our number needs to satisfy this rule. Divisibility rules can guide us in narrowing the options down.\n\nA possible case is when the hundreds digit is 9 and the tens digit is 6. This makes the sum of the digits 15, but 15 is not divisible by 9.\n\nAnother possible case is when the hundreds digit is 9 and the tens digit is 3. This makes the sum of the digits 12, which is divisible by 9. \n\nWhen the hundreds digit is 9 and the tens digit is 3, then the number 936 is divisible by 9.\n- Additionally, 936 is also divisible by 3.\n- However, 936 is also divisible by 6 (which is 2 x 3), which should make the number divisible by 2.\n\nFor this case, 936 is divisible by its tens and hundreds digits. Divisibility by its units digit also comes down to it being an integer multiplier i.e. 6.\n\nAs we also know that for 936 to be the biggest possible three-digit number and smallest of all possible permutations of 3 digit numbers it has to be divisible by 6 as much as by 9.

    "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we can start by breaking down the problem. \n\n1. **Let's start with the largest possible hundreds digit:** We know that the largest three-digit number is 999, so our hundreds digit should be as large as possible. However, we also know that if the hundreds digit is a prime number greater than 5, then the number won't be divisible by that prime number, as the sum of the digits is more than 9. Therefore, the largest possible hundreds digit is 9.\n\n2. **Try the hundreds digit 9:** We want to find the largest three-digit number with a hundreds digit of 9. By symmetry, the tens and units digits have to be 8 and x (or 7 and x, or 6 and x), where 0 < x < 9. If we try 987, it's not divisible by 7, so we'll rule out numbers like this.\n\n   If the units digit is 8, then for 9 to be a factor of the number, the sum of the other two digits must be even. This isn't possible because their sum is 9 + 8 = 17, which isn't divisible by 2, nor would 7 + 8 fit (7 and 8 add to 15 and that number cannot divide 15)  and so on. The units digit also needs to be such that x and 9 do not add up to an odd number because a odd number is never divisible by 2 so if we look at the number formed with 6 or 7 or 8 our final digit looks as if any number from these and we can have a possible sum higher which isn't good enough to add up so inherently the numbers like 8 as our single digit will not be our possible region and if the units doesn't take numbers below x = 7. now let's go ahead and try. <i>Given that all natural numbers are divisible by 1.</i>\n\n   Let's assume we have the 6 and we want to see the hundreds and the tens numbers.\n\n   Let's assume that 9 and 8 won't fit because, we want the digits 6 maybe as our final digit, not possibly else that  are odd like 7 as tens.\n\n\n3.   **Largest possible hundreds digit with units digit of 6:** By this same rule of divisibility, we have 976, 967, and 969. However, 976 is divisible by all three of its digits (1, 7, 6). So, our final answer is -\n\n\n\\boxed{976}."

  "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",
