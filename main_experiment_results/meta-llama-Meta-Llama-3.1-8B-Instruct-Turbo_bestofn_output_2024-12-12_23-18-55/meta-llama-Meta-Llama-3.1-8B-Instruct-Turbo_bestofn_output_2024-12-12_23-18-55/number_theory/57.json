    "To find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Consider the first integer with a remainder of $10$ when divided by $24$. This can be represented as $24a + 10$, where $a$ is an integer.\n\n2. Consider the second integer with a remainder of $4$ when divided by $24$. This can be represented as $24b + 4$, where $b$ is an integer.\n\n3. Consider the third integer with a remainder of $12$ when divided by $24$. This can be represented as $24c + 12$, where $c$ is an integer.\n\n4. Now, we can find the sum of the three integers. Adding them together, we get: \n   \\[(24a + 10) + (24b + 4) + (24c + 12) = 24a + 24b + 24c + 26.\\]\n\n   This can be simplified by rearranging the terms to:\n   \\[24(a + b + c) + 26.\\]\n\n5. The $24(a + b + c)$ part is a multiple of $24$, so it will not contribute to the remainder. The remainder will be determined by the \"extra\" $26$, which can be further broken down as $24 + 2$. Therefore, it leaves a remainder of $2$ when divided by $24$.\n\nSo, the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "To find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Let's assume the three integers are $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$. We know that when $x_1$ is divided by $24$, the remainder is $10$. Similarly, when $x_2$ is divided by $24$, the remainder is $4$, and when $x_3$ is divided by $24$, the remainder is $12$.\n\n2. We can express the three integers as follows:\n   - $x_1 = 24a + 10$ (where $a$ is a positive integer)\n   - $x_2 = 24b + 4$ (where $b$ is a positive integer)\n   - $x_3 = 24c + 12$ (where $c$ is a positive integer)\n\n3. Now, let's find the sum of the three integers:\n   - $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = (24a + 10) + (24b + 4) + (24c + 12)$\n   - Simplifying the equation, we get:\n   - $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 24a + 24b + 24c + 10 + 4 + 12$\n   - Combine like terms:\n   - $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 24(a + b + c) + 26$\n\n4. When the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, the $24(a + b + c)$ term will be completely divisible with a remainder of $0$. \n   - So, we need to find the remainder of $26$ divided by $24$.\n\n5. The remainder of $26$ divided by $24$ is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\nTherefore, when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, the remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "To find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24, we can start by representing each integer based on the given remainders.\n\nLet's call the three integers A, B, and C. When A, B, and C are divided by 24, the remainders are 10, 4, and 12, respectively. This can be represented as:\n\nA = 24a + 10\nB = 24b + 4\nC = 24c + 12\n\nwhere a, b, and c are some positive integers.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of A, B, and C.\n\nSum = A + B + C\n= (24a + 10) + (24b + 4) + (24c + 12)\n= 24a + 24b + 24c + 10 + 4 + 12\n= 24(a + b + c) + 26\n\nSince we are dividing the sum by 24, the term 24(a + b + c) is perfectly divisible by 24. The remainder will be determined by the constant term 26.\n\nWe can write 26 as:\n26 = 24 + 2\n\nSo, when 26 is divided by 24, the remainder is 2.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24 is 2.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{2}.$"
