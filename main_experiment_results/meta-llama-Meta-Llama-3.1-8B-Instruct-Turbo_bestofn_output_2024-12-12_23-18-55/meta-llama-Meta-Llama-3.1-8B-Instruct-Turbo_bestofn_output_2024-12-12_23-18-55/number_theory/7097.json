    "To start, we know that $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1$, indicating that $m + n$ is coprime with $210$ which means it shares no prime factors with $210$. \n\nThe prime factorization of 210 is:\n$210 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7$.\n\nNow, we'll work on the second condition, $m^m$ being a multiple of $n^n$. This means that the prime factors of $n^n$ must divide $m^m$, and since $n^n$ is $n$ raised to the power of $n$, we know that all the prime factors of $n$ will appear $n$ times in the prime factorization of $n^n$. We need to ensure that for every prime factor $p$ of $n$, the total number of times it occurs in the prime factorization of $m^m$ is at least $n$.\n\nGiven the condition that $m$ is not a multiple of $n$, we should pick $n$ to have a prime factorization such that its prime factors also divide $m$, but in fewer instances, suggesting a possible choice of $n$ that enables this. Let's test the power of $n = 2^k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nFor $n = 2^k$, we should ensure the following holds:\n- $m$ has a multiple of $2^k$, and its power is greater than or equal to $(k-1)$\n- Since $m^m$ needs to have at least $2^{kn}$, let $m = 2^j$.

    "To find the least possible value of $m+n$, we'll examine the given conditions and constraints.\n\n1. $\\gcd(m+n,210)=1$: This condition implies that $m+n$ is coprime to $210$, which means it does not share any prime factors with $210 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. In other words, $m+n$ is not divisible by $2$, $3$, $5$, or $7$.\n\n2. $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$: This condition can be rewritten as $m^m/k^k = n^n$ for some positive integer $k$, where $k$ is a factor of $n^m$. This implies that $k$ must divide both $m^m$ and $n^n$.\n\n3. $m$ is not a multiple of $n$: This condition ensures that $m$ and $n$ have no common factors, i.e., $\\gcd(m, n) = 1$. \n\nFrom the third condition, we can see that both $m$ and $n$ must be coprime to each other, which further implies that they are relatively prime.\n\nLet's examine some common factors between $m^m$ and $n^n$. One way for $m^m$ to be a multiple of $n^n$ is if $n^n$ is a factor of $m^m$. For this to happen, we could consider cases where $n$ is a power of a prime, and the corresponding power of that prime is a factor of $m$, or $m$ has a larger prime factor. \n\nHowever, we cannot simply try all combinations because the third condition ($m$ is not a multiple of $n$) prevents us from doing so directly.\n\nOne way to approach this is to think of a few special cases for $n$ and try to find the corresponding $m$ values.\n\nLet's start with the minimal case where $n$ is a power of a prime.\n\nConsider $n=p^a$ where $p$ is a prime number not dividing 210. Therefore, if $p = 11$, $\\gcd(n, 210) = 1$.\n\nConsider $n = 121 = 11^2$. For $m^m$ to be divisible by $n^n = 11^{4}$, we can choose $m=11$, in a minimal case to fulfill this requirement ($m^m/121^2 = 11^6$). The value of $k = 121$, and $m=11$ satisfies all conditions. $m+n = 11+121 = 132$.\n\nTherefore, we obtained a value of $132$, but we seek the least possible $m+n$. Let's look for smaller values of $n$.\n\nConsider $n=p^a$ where $p$ is a prime number not dividing 210, but with a smaller power. \n\nConsider $n = 11^2$'s smaller counterpart $n = 11$.\n\n Now we have  $n = 11$, however we seek a larger value of $m$, such that $m^m$ is a multiple of $11^{11}$ but $m$ isn't a multiple of 11. \n\nConsider a simple value for $m$, but slightly exceeding the power of $p$; $m = 11\\cdot b$. However, with $m = 11b, m$ isn't a multiple of 11, so $b$ must be chosen such that $m^m$ would remain a multiple of $11^{11}$; but, if $m^m$ was a multiple of $11^{11b}$ the three conditions of the problem would be satisfied.\n\nHence we have $m^m = 11^{11b} \\cdot c$, which yields $m = 11 \\cdot b$, so $11b^b \\cdot c = 11^{11b}$. Now we have  $b^{b}c= 11^{10b}.$ Given that $n = 11^2$ and $m+n$ needs to be minimized, we want to minimize $m$ so that $m^m+11^2$ is greater than $11^2.$ Otherwise, $m^m$ can not be a multiple of $11^{11}$ and  $m+n>11^2=121.$\n\nIn particular we seek an equation of type $$11^{10b} = 11^{2B} x^{C}.$$ Considering only the coefficients of 11, we have B = 2b, C = b.\n\nThe choice of B = 2b and C = b arises from our desire to minimize b, so that  c = $x^{C}$. When C = b, $x$ is raised to a lower power, given a lower number. To find $c$, so we have a lower bound on m. Considering all these restrictions and trying out this simple scenario $b = 3$ and  c =23 or $m$ = 33  so we obtain: $m+n = 33 + 11^2 = 64$.\n\nHowever, let's go back to $n=11^2$, but with a larger value of $m$, i.e. find $m> 11b$ for some number  b, so that $m = 11 c$ with $c > b$. Following this line and looking at the possible choices we notice that we should try with $n=11^2$, and $m =  11 \\cdot b$ for some choice of $b > 2$.\n\nThis choice for $b$ stems from our condition that we seek the minimum value for $m+n$, which means we need to have $m^m+11^2 > 11^2$.\n\nThus for the simple scenario we can choose c = 21 as $b$ = 2.\n\nNow we can compute the smallest  $m+n$ with $n=11^2, c=21$, i.e. $m+n = m + 11^2$.\n\nSince from our considerations above we have: $m^m = 11^6 \\cdot c$; given $c=21$ we get: $m = 33$.\n\nUsing this we obtain the least possible value of $m+n$: $$ m+n =  33 +11^2 = \\boxed{64}$$",
    "To find the least possible value of $m+n,$ we need to understand and work with the given conditions.\n\nThe first condition is $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1.$ This means that the greatest common divisor of $m+n$ and $210$ is $1.$ We can use the prime factorization of $210$ to better understand this condition. The prime factorization of $210$ is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7.$ Therefore, the possible prime factors of $m+n$ must be other than $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ or $7.$\n\nThe second condition is $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n.$ This means that $n^n$ divides $m^m.$\n\nThe third condition is $m$ is not a multiple of $n.$ This means that $m$ and $n$ are not related by a simple ratio.\n\nLet's consider some special cases and start with the smallest power of $n$ that could be a divisor of $m^m.$ A perfect square could be a great choice, as all of its prime factors will be squared. \n\nThe smallest non-trivial perfect square number that is the power of a prime other than $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ or $7$ would be $11^2.$ \n\nLet $n^2=11^2.$ Let's choose the smallest number that is a power of some prime other than $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ or $7,$ to be the $n$ in this case. In this case, let $n=11.$ To find $m,$ we need $m$ to be such that the smallest power of $n$ that would divide $m^m$ is $n^n$ (in this case, $11^{11}$)\n\nGiven that we need the smallest $n$ that can divide the cubic so the square power of $n$ would be the perfect square of our $n.$ The largest factor of our exponent in the case of $n^{n}$ being our prime exponent in this perfect square number in our $m$ is $11^2$ or $121$ \n\nIf we let $m = 11k$ (we do not want m to be multiple of n here as interval in given question), and since we are looking for the lowest $m + n$ as per interval, $k$ should be the smallest number in the case of $n = 11.$ In order for $n^n$ to be a factor of $m^m,$ we must have $m$ such that $k^{11k} \\cdot 11^{11k} = 11^{11k} \\cdot k'^{11}.$ We can then choose the value of $k$ which is the smallest power of some prime that will result in the same exponent of the prime in both terms. The term with exponent $11k$ is our $k'$ in our first term, till we do not have $n^n$ equals perfect power of some number as perfect square of power of our $n$ (our exponent in the case of $n^n$).\n\nGiven the target of the exponent in the case of $n^n$ (as we chosen to be the lowest number with the conditions such that $k$ is lowest power prime so that  in that case term  $11k$ has perfect square as an exponent of power of $n = 11$) the value of $k$ which will satisfy this is the smallest exponent of a prime number in such a form so that when we pick the power of that prime that will have same exponent (we want the lowest number so in turn the lowest number for $k$), this will yield till we have our requirement with the minimal cubic so the value of $k$ is $11.$\n\nTherefore, $m = 11k$ becomes $m = 11 \\cdot 11,$ which is $m = 121.$ Substituting the values of $m$ and $n$ in the equation $m + n,$ we get:\n\n$$m + n = 121 + 11 = 132.$$\n\nHence, the least possible value of $m + n$ is $\\boxed{132}.$"
