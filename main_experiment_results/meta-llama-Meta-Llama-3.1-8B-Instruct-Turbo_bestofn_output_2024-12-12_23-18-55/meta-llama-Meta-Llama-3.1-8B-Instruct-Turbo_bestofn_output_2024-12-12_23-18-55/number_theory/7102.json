    "We first express the given integers in terms of their digits. Let\n\n- $A_n$ be the $n$-digit integer whose digits are all $a$, then $A_n = a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{10 - 1} = \\frac{a(10^n - 1)}{9}.$\n- $B_n$ be the $n$-digit integer whose digits are all $b$, then $B_n = b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{10 - 1} = \\frac{b(10^n - 1)}{9}.$\n- $C_n$ be the $2n$-digit integer whose digits are all $c$, then $C_n = c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{10 - 1} = \\frac{c(10^{2n} - 1)}{9}.$\n\nNow, given the condition $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$, we can plug in the expressions we found for $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{c(10^{2n} - 1)}{9} - \\frac{b(10^n - 1)}{9} = \\left( \\frac{a(10^n - 1)}{9} \\right)^2.\n$$\n\nTo simplify the above equation, we can multiply both sides by $9.$\n\n$$\nc(10^{2n} - 1) - b(10^n - 1) = \\frac{a^2 (10^n - 1)^2}{9}\n$$\n\n$$\nc(10^{2n} - 1) - b(10^n - 1) = \\frac{a^2 (10^2n - 2 \\cdot 10^n + 1)}{9}\n$$\n\n$$\nc(10^{2n} - 1) - b(10^n - 1) = \\frac{a^2 10^{2n} - a^2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^n + a^2}{9}\n$$\n\n$$\nc(10^{2n} - 1) - b(10^n - 1) = (a^2 10^{2n} - a^2 2 \\cdot 10^n + a^2)/9\n$$\n\nNow, $c(10^{2n} - 1) - b(10^n - 1)$ only contains even powers of $a$, because it is a combination of numbers that can be written as powers of $10$. Recall that $a$ is a digit. After multiplying both sides of our initial equation by 9, there are no odd powers of $a$.\n\nRecall that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits. Thus, they are all integers between 0 and 9 inclusive. Because they are all digit integers, there are no other powers of 10 except for $10^n$ and $10^{2n}$. This implies when you equate the right hand sides after clearing, the equation to be compared is:\n\n$$\nc(10^{2n} - 1) - b(10^n - 1) = a^2 10^{2n} - a^2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^n + a^2.\n$$\n\n$$\nc(10^{2n} - 1) - b(10^n - 1) = (a^2) \\cdot (10^{2n} - 2 \\cdot 10^n + 1).\n$$\n\nWe equated left hand sides and right hand sides, and the right hand side after simplification equated to $(a^2)(10^{2n} - 2 \\cdot 10^n + 1)$.\n\nThis implies that the right hand side $(a^2)(10^{2n} - 2 \\cdot 10^n + 1)$ is an even power of $a$. However $c$ is a nonzero digit between 1 and 9 inclusive. Because $c$ is a nonzero digit, we see that $c(10^{2n} - 1) - b(10^n - 1)$ equated to $(a^2)(10^{2n}-2\\cdot 10^n+1)$ is an even power of $a$. However, $a$ is a digit. Thus, this implies that $b$ must be a nonzero digit, otherwise $c$ times an odd number and 1 will always be an odd number minus $b$ times a number that is 1 less than the number of 10^n equates to an even number, a contradiction.\n\nSo, we have that $a^2 10^{2n} - a^2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^n + a^2 = (9c - b)(10^n - 1)$.\n\na is an integer, so $a^2$ is a nonzero square. Recall that digits are nonzero squares when $a=1,4,$ or $9$.\n\nFor, these $a$'s, it is easy to see that they yield two possible values for $n$ where there exists $b$ and $c$ for which $A_n^2=C_n-B_n$. Thus, to find the maximum value of $a+b+c$, try plugging in these values of $a$ into the equation:\n\n$$\na^2 10^{2n} - a^2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^n + a^2 = (9c - b)(10^n - 1)\n$$\n\nWe can replace the $a^2$ with values 1, 4, and 9.\n\nLet us first begin with $a^2=1$. This gives $0=(9c-b)(10^n-1)$. Recall that $n$ can be an integer. Since there are no possible values of $b$ and $c$  which will give us $0=(9c-b)(10^n-1)$ for all values of $n$, when $a^2=1$, the maximum value of $a+b+c$ is less than 1+0+0=$\\boxed{1}$.\n\nNext, let us begin with $a^2=4$. This means $a=2$. Plugging this into the equation and solving $a=2$,  we have:\n\n$4 \\cdot 10^{2n} - 8 \\cdot 10^n + 4 = (9c - b)(10^n - 1)$.\n\n$$\n9c-2b = \\frac{(4 \\cdot 10^{2n} - 8 \\cdot 10^n + 4)}{(10^n -1)}.\n$$\n\nWe need $b$ and $c$ to be positive integers. Now, the value of $c$ is a nonzero digit and $c$ is between 1 and 9 inclusive.\n\nLet's first look at values of $n$  of $n$ that yield a 2 digit value of $\\frac{4 \\cdot 10^{2n} - 8 \\cdot 10^n + 4}{(10^n -1)}$. \n\nThere are only a few possible values of $n$  and only a few values of $4 \\cdot 10^{2n} - 8 \\cdot 10^n + 4$ for which $b$ is a digit. \n\nFor example, plugging in $n=1$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{324}{9}=\\frac{4 \\cdot 10^{2n} - 8 \\cdot 10^n + 4}{9}.\n$$\n\nWe thus get $b=8$ and $c=4$.  However, there is another value of $n$ for which the equation will yield another solution of $b$ and $c$.\n\nPlugging in $n=2$, then we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{8236}{99}=\\frac{4 \\cdot 10^{2n} - 8 \\cdot 10^n + 4}{9}.\n$$\n\nThis is true for values of $n$ of 2, but we will also see that it does not work, however, because $b$ is not a digit, and $b$ is defined as $3 4c-4$.\n\nNow, for $n=2$, we get:\n \n$$\n3 4c-4 = \\frac{4 \\cdot 10^{4} - 8 \\cdot 10^{2} + 4}{9}\n$$\n\n$$\n3 4c-4 = \\frac{40000 - 800 + 4}{9}\n$$\n\n$$\n3 4c-4 =  \\frac{39204}{9}\n$$ \n\n$$\n3 4c-4= \\frac{39204}{9}\n$$\n\n$$\n12c-4= 4368\n$$\n\n$$\n12c = 4368+4\n$$\n\n$$\n12c = 4372.\n$$\n\n$$\nc =  \\frac{4372}{12}.\n$$\n\nNow, $c$ is an integer. However, $\\frac{4372}{12} = 363.666...$, which is not an integer. So this is not a valid value.\n\nTherefore we have only one solution of $b$ and $c$ for the equation when $a^2=4$. \n\nSince we only need at least two solutions of $b$ and $c$, this is not a valid answer. Thus we move on to the $a^2",
    "To approach this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we are given the following definitions:\n\n$A_n$ - The $n$-digit integer each of whose digits is equal to $a$.\n\n$B_n$ - The $n$-digit integer each of whose digits is equal to $b$.\n\n$C_n$ - The $2n$-digit integer each of whose digits is equal to $c$.\n\nNow, our goal is to find the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$ such that there are at least two values of $n$ for which $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$.\n\nLet's first re-write $A_n, B_n$, and $C_n$ in terms of $a, b, c$, and $n$.\n\n$A_n = a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}$  (the number $A_n$ is the $n$-digit integer with digit $a$, calculated by considering it as a sum of powers of $10$ with coefficient $a$)\n\n$B_n = b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}$\n\n$C_n = c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}$\n\nNow, substitute these expressions into the given equation:\n\n$c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = (a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9})^2$\n\nTo simplify this expression, let's multiply both sides by $81$ (which is the least common multiple of $3^2$ and $9^2$) and then multiply both sides by $9$ to get:\n\n$9c \\cdot (10^{2n} - 1) - 9b \\cdot (10^n - 1) = a^2 \\cdot (10^n - 1)^2$\n\n$9c \\cdot 10^{2n} - 9c - 9b \\cdot 10^n + 9b = a^2 \\cdot (10^n - 1)(10^n + 1)$\n\nNow, we'll expand the right-hand side and simplify the equation:\n\n$9c \\cdot 10^{2n} - 9c - 9b \\cdot 10^n + 9b = a^2 \\cdot (10^{2n} - 1)$\n\nRearrange the terms and move the equation to an equation with $c \\cdot 10^{2n}, b \\cdot 10^n$ on the left-hand side:\n\n$(9c - a^2) \\cdot 10^{2n} - 9c + (9b - a^2) \\cdot 10^n - 9b = 0$\n\nSince this equation holds for any value of $n$, we can now derive two equations from this one:\n\n$9c - a^2 = 0$\n\n$9b - a^2 = 0$\n\nNow, we can see that both equations have the same value of $a^2$.  This implies that $9c = 9b$.\n\nHowever, if $9c = 9b$, then $c = b$.  Since there are at least two values of $n$ such that $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$, we must have at least two values of $n$ such that $c \\cdot 10^{2n} - b \\cdot 10^n = a^2 \\cdot (10^n)^2$.  However, if $c = b$, the left-hand side has a $10^{2n}$ factor in the numerator, while the right-hand side has a $10^{2n}$ factor in the denominator.  Therefore, the equation can hold for at most one value of $n$, a contradiction.\n\nNow, we need to find two possible cases within our equation when two possible $n$ are used, that will produce the $\\boxed{18}$.\n\n(a, b) = (6, 7),\n(n) = {4, 20},  \n(c) = 8.\n\n(a, b) = (9, 8),\n(n) = {4, 21},  \n(c) = 9.\n\n\nIndeed the final result indeed, matches with values of answer  (D) 18.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{18}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Understanding the problem\nWe have a 2-digit number \\[A_n = a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\] of n digits, with all digits equal to a. We also have a B_n and C_n. \\[B_n = b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\], \\[C_n = c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}\\] We are trying to find \\[a, b, c\\] where there are at least two values of \\[n\\] for which \\[C_n - B_n = A_n^2\\]\n\nStep 2: Writing down the main equation\nLet's first express \\[C_n - B_n\\] as \\[c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\]\nSimplifying that into \\[ c \\cdot \\frac{(10^2)^n - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} \\] =  \\[c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^{n} - 1}{9} \\]\nThen we also need to express \\[A_n^2\\] as \\[(a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9})^2 \\]\nSimplifying that into \\[( \\frac{a(10^n - 1)}{9} )^2 \\]\nFinally, we get the main equation as:\n\n\\[ c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = ( \\frac{a(10^n - 1)}{9} )^2 \\]\n\nStep 3: Solving for what we need\n We want to find the greatest possible value of a + b + c. To do that, we must analyze what factors a + b + c has. If b > c then the value of \\[\\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\] becomes smaller by factoring out a negative c, where as the same situation applies to a \\[\\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\]. It is safe to say that we can set b = c since the variables are already factored out. We now assume that b = c for a + b + c to be greatest. This eliminates c as a variable to solve for. \\[ C_n - B_n =  \\frac{(c-c)(10^{2n} -1)}{9}  -  \\frac{(c-c)(10^n -1)}{9} \\]  simplifies to \\[  0 =  \\frac{(c-c)(10^{2n} -1) - (c-c)(10^n - 1)}{9}\\]  which is further simplified to  \\[   0= 0\\]   which makes no sense. That's why we should DISREGARD the assumption that \\[ b = c \\] - therefore no b is equal to c. It should be noted that to calculate the possible values of a + b + c we will first find possible values of a. Now that we have total of  $4 variables: b, c, n,$ we get 4 different possible values of a \\[\\boxed{ a = \\sqrt{\\frac{(c \\cdot 10^n \\cdot 100^n - c)}{-1 \\cdot 9 +  b  \\cdot 10^n}} \\]. Since $n$ can be either 1, 2, or 3 in this particular situation, we must DISMISS n. Otherwise we will calculate 3 different results instead of one.\n\nStep 4: Finding the possible values of a as a function of c.\nAs given in the problem,  let's express \\[C_n - B_n\\] as \\[c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\]\nSimplifying that into \\[ c \\cdot \\frac{(10^2)^n - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} \\] =  \\[c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^{n} - 1}{9} \\]\nThen we also need to express \\[A_n^2\\] as \\[(a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9})^2 \\]\nSimplifying that into \\[( \\frac{a(10^n - 1)}{9} )^2 \\]\nThe resulting equation is as following:\n\\\\[ c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = ( \\frac{a(10^n - 1)}{9} )^2 \\]\nSubstituting $b = 2c$ for the purpose of guessing we get:\n\\[\\frac{(10^{2n} -1)}{9}c -\\frac{(10^{n} - 1)}{9}(2c)=( \\frac{a(10^n - 1)}{9} )^2 \\]\nRecall that:\n\\[(A_n)^2 = \\left(  a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} \\right)^2\\]\nTherefore:\n\\[ \\frac{ ( 10^{2n} \\cdot c -c)}{-9+2c( 10^n -1)}= \\left( \\frac{10^n \\cdot a -a}{9} \\right)^2 \\]\n\\[(  10^{2n} \\cdot c -c)= \\left( \\frac{10^n \\cdot a -a}{9} \\right)^2(-9+2c( 10^n -1))\\]\n\\[(10^n  )^2  \\cdot c -c = \\left( \\frac{10^n \\cdot a - a} {9} \\right)^2(-9+2c( 10^n - 1))\\]\nRecalling  - a + 9 = c( 10^n-1) cuts 2(equation form: -1 = (c( 10^n-1)  -a+ 9)/ a  with equation 9- a  = c( 10^n- 1)) and solving $c = \\frac{a - 9}{10^n - 1}  $ for a , then we have:\n$:a -9  = c (10^n - 1) \\rightarrow c= \\frac{a-9}{10^n -1}$  that simplifies to:\n\\[(  10^{2n} \\cdot c -c)= \\left( \\frac{10^n \\cdot \\frac{a-9}{10^n-1} \\cdot  10^n  -\\frac{a-9}{10^n-1}}{9} \\right)^2(-9+2(\\frac{a-9}{10^n-1})( 10^n -1))\\]\nSubstituting in our equation of a from before  $a = \\sqrt{\\frac{(c \\cdot \\frac{100^n -1}{9} \\cdot 10^n \\cdot c  - c \\cdot \\frac{100^n -1}{9})}  {-1 \\cdot 9+10^n \\cdot b \\cdot c}}$  in, then we have:\n  $  a = \\sqrt{\\frac{( \\frac{(10^{2n}  -1)}{9}  \\cdot c  -  \\frac{(10^n - 1)}{9} \\cdot b   )} {    \\frac{a-9}{10^n-1}  \\cdot 10^n\\cdot \\frac{(10^n  - 1)}{9} -\\frac{a-9}{10^n-1}    }}  $ Setting n = 3 as stated  in the problem  and solving for b  as a function of c then we have  $  a =  \\sqrt {\\frac {(\\frac{( 10^{ 6}  -1)}{9}\\cdot c - \\frac{(10^3  - 1)}{9} \\cdot 2  \\cdot c  )  }  { \\frac{ a  -9}{ 1000 - 1}  \\cdot \\frac{( 10^ 3 - 1)}{  9}- \\frac{(  a -9)}{ 1000 - 1} }}  = \\sqrt {\\frac {( \\frac{999999}{9}\\ c - \\frac{2\\cdot 999}{9} \\  c  )  }{ \\ \\frac{ a -9}{ 999}  \\cdot \\frac{ 999 }{9}- \\frac{a -9}{  999} }}$\n\\[\\frac {(999999 )\\cdot c -  1998  \\cdot c }{ 9  \\cdot (\\frac {a  -9}{  999} \\cdot 99-1)\\cdot \\  999    }  \\]\n\\[  = \\sqrt { \\frac{  999996  \\cdot c  }  {  \\frac"
