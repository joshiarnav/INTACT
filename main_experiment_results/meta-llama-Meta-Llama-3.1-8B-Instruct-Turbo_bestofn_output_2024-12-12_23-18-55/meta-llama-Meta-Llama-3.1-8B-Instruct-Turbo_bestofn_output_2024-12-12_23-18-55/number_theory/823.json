    "To find the fraction of all clever integers that are divisible by 27, we need to first identify all clever integers. A clever integer is an even integer greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9.\n\nStep 1: Find all even integers greater than 20 and less than 120.\nThe even integers in the given range are: 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114.\n\nStep 2: Filter out the even integers such that the sum of their digits is not 9.\nTo filter out such integers, we will consider each even integer and calculate the sum of its digits. For example, the integer 22 has the digits 2 and 2, so the sum of its digits is 4. The integer 24 has the digits 2 and 4, so the sum of its digits is 6. We continue this process to filter out the integers that do not have a sum of digits equal to 9.\n\nAfter filtering out such integers, the remaining even integers that have a sum of digits equal to 9 are: 27 is ruled out because it is odd. The next even integer is 36, then 45 is ruled out because its digits sum to 9, the next even integer is 54, then 63 is ruled out because its digits do not properly sum to 9, it is an odd integer itself, the next even integer is 72,  then  90 is ruled out, and the last even integer that meets the requirement 108 is ruled out. So we simply are left with: 36, 54, 72, and 90 is ruled out, so no,  108 is ruled out and 114 is ruled out, leaving just 36, 54, 72, and 108 is ruled out and 114 is ruled out and 90 ruled out, so 36, 54, 72.\n\nStep 3: Find the clever integers that are divisible by 27.\nAmong the remaining integers 36, 54, 72, only 54 and 108 is ruled out, and 114 ruled out, and 90 ruled out, leaving 54 and 36.",
    "To find the fraction of all clever integers that is divisible by 27, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find all clever integers**: Kaleb defined a clever integer as an even integer that is greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9. \n\nWe will list down all 2-digit even numbers between 20 and 120 that are divisible by 27, which are the ones that meet the criteria for 'clever integers'.\n\nThe two-digit numbers between 20 and 120 that are divisible by 27 are: 27, 54, 81, 108. However, only two of these numbers - 54 and 108 are even. Now we only need to focus on 54 and 108 since they are the only numbers from the list that meet all of the given criteria for 'clever numbers'.\n\nNow that we know the two clever integers that are divisible by 27, we can move on to step 2.\n\n2. **Find the total number of clever integers**: After re-evaluating the conditions and checking for the sum of digits that equals 9, we realize that the solution space actually yields a different set of possibilities. We found that the list of clever integers consists of: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, and 117. However, upon further checking, we see that only five of these clever integers are even. \n\nThe five clever integers are 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108. These are the ones that meet the conditions for 'clever integers', which includes the sum of the digits being 9 and being even.\n\n3. **Find the ratio of clever integers that are divisible by 27**: Now, we can easily find the ratio of clever integers that are divisible by 27. From the list of clever integers we found, there are three that meet the criteria for the sum of digits being 9 and are even, and among those three, only 54 and 108 are divisible by 27. So, the number of clever integers that are divisible by 27 is two, and the total number of clever integers is five. \n\nHence, the fraction of all clever integers that is divisible by 27 is $\\frac{2}{5}$. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",
    "To find the fraction of all clever integers that are divisible by 27, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify all clever integers:**\n    A clever integer is defined as an even integer between 20 and 120 with a digit sum of 9.\n    To find clever integers, we will examine all possible combinations of two-digit numbers with a sum of 9 between 20 and 120.\n\n    Possible digit combinations for two-digit numbers are: \n    - 0x + 9x (where 0 + 9x is between 20 and 120), \n    - 1x + 8x and \n    - 9x + 0x \n    With x greater than or equal to 3, the sum will be greater than 20. With x = 4 or more, the largest digit we'll have is 8.\n    We're only interested in even numbers, which means the ones digit must be 8 to be even; the tens digit must be 1 to reach a digit sum of 9. Therefore, only 38, 47, 56, 65, 74, 83, 92, and 98 and  18x do not work. and  18 and  9x do, let the number be x8 with x  4. \n    So, the numbers are 38, 56, 74, 92, 98, 48, 57,  68, 76 ( we had 18x numbers before so 189),  96, 48  57, 67, 87. Since we have found already that all of the 18x didn't work 189 and  18, and the rest are the new ones. Then  we found all the clever numbers with their respective digit sum being 9.\n    We now remove all the ones that aren't even because we are only looking for even integers so  57, which is odd, and  57, which is odd,  67 which is odd so remaining are  38,  48,  56 ,  68,  76,  87,  92, 189 doesn't work. We found our even numbers.\n\n2. **Find the clever numbers divisible by 27:**\n   In the list  38,  48,  56,  68,  76,  87,  92,  the numbers  76 and  92 are divisible by 27. Therefore our 2 numbers are 76, and  92."
