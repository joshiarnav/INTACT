    "To evaluate the expression $(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5,$ we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: \n\n$6 + 1 - 4 = 7 - 4 = 3$\n\n2. Now, we have: \n\n$21 \\div 3 \\cdot 5$\n\n3. Next, we perform the division: \n\n$21 \\div 3 = 7$\n\n4. Now, we multiply the result by 5:\n\n$7 \\cdot 5 = 35$\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{35}$.",

    "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression within the parentheses:\n\n   Inside the parentheses, we have: $6 + 1 - 4$\n\n   Following the order of operations (PEMDAS), we first add $6$ and $1$, which gives us $7$. Then we subtract $4$ from $7$, resulting in $3$.\n\n   Therefore, the expression becomes:\n   $$ (21 \\div (3)) \\cdot 5 $$\n\n2. Now, we'll perform the division operation:\n\n   $21 \\div 3 = 7$\n\n   So, we have:\n   $$ 7 \\cdot 5 $$\n\n3. Finally, we'll perform the multiplication operation:\n\n   $7 \\cdot 5 = 35$\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{35}$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) and arrive at the same answer: $\\boxed{35}$. \n\nHowever, I would select Solution 1 as the best solution. It is concise, easy to read, and the steps are clearly outlined. The solution also uses the correct mathematical notation (e.g., $7 \\cdot 5$ instead of $7 * 5$).\n\nTherefore, the best solution is:\n1",
  "solution": "Recall that expressions within parentheses should be done first. In the inner set of parentheses, we have $6+1-4=3.$ So, the outer set of parentheses can be rewritten as $21\\div3=7.$ Finally, \\[(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5=7\\cdot5=\\boxed{35}.\\]",
