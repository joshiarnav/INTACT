    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime.\n\nOne-digit primes are numbers between 1 and 10 that have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves. The one-digit primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nTwo-digit prime numbers are numbers between 10 and 99 that have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves. The two-digit primes start from 11 (which is a prime number) all the way up to 97. \n\nFrom the two-digit prime numbers, we can find that 97 is the largest two-digit prime.\n\nNow, we have the two largest one-digit primes: 5 and 7, and the largest two-digit prime: 97.\n\nTo find the product, we multiply these three numbers together: 5 * 7 * 97.\n\nLet's calculate the product: 5 * 7 = 35 and 35 * 97 = 3395.\n\nTherefore, the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime is $\\boxed{3395}$.",
    "Step 1: Identify the one-digit primes. The one-digit primes are the prime numbers that are less than 10. These numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\nStep 2: Among the one-digit primes, identify the two largest. The two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7.\n\nStep 3: Now, we need to identify the largest two-digit prime. Two-digit prime numbers are greater than 9 and less than 100. To find the largest two-digit prime, we will consider prime numbers within this range: 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97. The largest two-digit prime is 97.\n\nStep 4: Now that we have the required prime numbers, we multiply them together: 5 * 7 * 97 = 3395.\n\nStep 5: The result is in the required format, so we just need to box the answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3395}$",
    "To find the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime, we need to identify these primes first.\n\nOne-digit primes are numbers less than 10 that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. They are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7.\n\nNext, let's consider two-digit primes. Two-digit numbers are from 10 to 99. To identify the largest two-digit prime, we start from the highest two-digit number (99) and check if it's prime. \n\nA prime number can only be divided by 1 and itself. Among the two-digit numbers, 99 is not a prime (divisible by 3 and 33), 98 is not a prime (divisible by 2 and 49), and 97 is a prime. The prime numbers less than 97 (97 being the largest prime that is less than 100) are less, and we have that. Since 97 is the largest prime that is less that 100 and less than 99, we have that that is the largest two-digit prime.\n\nNow that we have identified the two largest one-digit primes as 5 and 7, and the largest two-digit prime as 97, we can find their product.\n\nThe product of 5, 7, and 97 is:\n5 * 7 * 97 = 3395\n\nSo, the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime is $\\boxed{3395}$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They all arrive at the same answer, $\\boxed{3395}$. \n\nHowever, Solution 1 is the most straightforward and concise. It directly identifies the two largest one-digit primes (5 and 7) and the largest two-digit prime (97), and then calculates their product. \n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "The two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7; the largest two-digit prime is 97 (98 and 99 are both composite).  The product of these three primes is $5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 97 = 35 \\cdot 97 = 35(100-3)=3500-105=\\boxed{3395}$.",
