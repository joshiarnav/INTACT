    "We are given the task to find the 20th digit after the decimal point of the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nFirst, let's convert the fractions into their decimal equivalents. \n\n$\\frac{1}{7}$ = 0.142857 (repeating), because 142857 is divisible by 7.\n\n$\\frac{1}{3}$ = 0.333333 (repeating), because every digit is 3.\n\nNow that we have the decimal equivalents, let's find their sum.\n\n0.142857 + 0.333333 = 0.476190 (repeating).\n\nWe found the decimal sum, but we need the 20th digit after the decimal point. However, since its repeating, we can find it with a simpler method.\n\nLet's first determine the length of the repeating pattern for the sum. The decimal sum of 0.476190, in the repeating expansion is: 0.476190476190. There are 6 digits. The repeating block is: 476190.\n\nNow that we know the repeating block length is 6, \nwe need to find the 20th digit after the decimal point. Since 20 = 6 * 3 + 2,\nWe know the 18th and 19th digits are part of the repeating block. The 18th digit is '7' and the 19th digit is '6'. Hence, the 20th digit is the second digit in the repeating pattern which is '9'.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{9}$",
    "To solve the problem, let's first convert the fractions to their decimal equivalents.\n\n1. To convert $\\frac{1}{7}$ to a decimal, we need to find a repeating pattern. 1 divided by 7 is approximately 0.142857142857... when you start performing long division. Notice the repeating pattern of 142857. \n\n2. Next, let's find the decimal equivalent for $\\frac{1}{3}$. To do that, let's perform long division. 1/3 is equal to approximately 0.333333... and the repeating pattern is 3.\n\nNow that we have the decimal equivalents, let's add them together. \n\n$\\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{3}$\n0.142857142857 + 0.333333333333...\nCombine the decimals:\n0.476190476190...\n\nThe pattern in the sum is now repeated after six decimal places, which is the 6 digit length in the repeating pattern of 142857 in 1/7 plus the repeating digit of '3' in 1/3.\n\nLet's find which digit of this pattern is the 20th digit after the decimal point.\n\nTo do this, find the first digit, and how many times 6 the difference between 20 and 1 is. Then check how far 1 is in the repeating pattern, and return that digit.\n\n1st Digit: 4\n6 * (20 - 1) / 6 = 19 \n Although the 20th digit is in the same repeating sequence, we need to add one more digit from the repeating sequence, and to do this we take the remainder of 20-1 being divided by 6 and convert that to how many digits to add.\n19/6 is not in integer form, this ends up being 19 /  6 = 3 remainder of 1.\n\nThus we add one.\nIn those cases the 1st, the 7th, the 13th digit, is a 7, since it is the 4th, 7th, and 13th in a six-digit pattern if you were to think of those patterns in a 0-5 frame",
    "To find the 20th digit after the decimal point of the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, we first need to convert the fractions to decimal equivalents.\n\nFor $\\frac{1}{7}$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{7} = 0.142857142857...$\n\nThe pattern $142857$ repeats. Since it has 6 digits, we will need to find where the 20th digit falls in this pattern.\n\nSince $6 \\times 3 = 18$, we know that the pattern will repeat 3 times with 2 digits left over (because 20 - 18 = 2). So, the 19th digit will be the 5th digit in the pattern (142857), and the 20th digit will be the 6th digit in the pattern, which is 8.\n\nHowever, since our target is the sum of two actual number $\\frac{1}{3}$ & $\\frac{1}{7}$ - it must be known that $\\frac{1}{3}$ = $0.\\overline{3}$. It's a single digit repeating (every single digits: 3 repeats forever) When copied the copied the decimal 0.142857142857... from number one into number two we both two ends (tail) removed, remaining

  "critique": "Solution 1 is correct because it correctly identifies the repeating pattern of the sum of the two fractions and finds the 20th digit after the decimal point.\n\nSolution 2 is incorrect because it incorrectly calculates the position of the 20th digit in the repeating pattern. It also incorrectly states that the repeating pattern has 6 digits, when in fact, the repeating pattern has 6 digits, but the sum of the two fractions has a repeating pattern of 6 digits as well.\n\nSolution 3 is also incorrect because it incorrectly handles the decimal expansion of the sum of the two fractions. It also incorrectly states that the 20th digit is the 6th digit in the repeating pattern, when in fact, the 20th digit is the 2nd digit in the repeating pattern.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$, and that of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $0.\\overline{3}$. The first has a repeating block of 6 digits and the second has a repeating block of 1 digit, so we believe the repeating block of the sum will have 6 digits and try adding the first 6 digits of each decimal representation.  $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}& & &. &1 & 4 & \\stackrel{1}{2} & 8 & \\stackrel{1}{5} & 7\\\\& +& &. &3 &3 & 3 & 3& 3 & 3\\\\ \\cline{1-9} & & & .& 4 &7 & 6 & 1 & 9 & 0\\\\ \\end{array} $$ Notice that continuing the addition past the first six digits will result in repeating blocks of the same six digits ($.142857+.333333=.476190$), so the decimal representation of the sum is $0.\\overline{476190}$. Since 20 divided by 6 has a remainder of 2, the 20th digit following the decimal point is the same as the second digit following the decimal point, which is $\\boxed{7}$.",
