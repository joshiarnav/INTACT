  "all_solutions": [
    "To find the image of the complex number $2i$ under the given dilation, we first need to understand the dilation process. \n\nThe dilation is centered at $-1 + 4i$ and has a scale factor of $-2$. This means that the vector from the center to $2i$ will be scaled by $-2$, and then we will find the new vector from the center to the image of $2i$.\n\n1. Find the vector from the center to $2i$: \nThe vector can be found by subtracting the center from the complex number: \n$(2i) - (-1 + 4i) = (2 - (-1)) + (1 - 4)i = 3 - 3i$\n\n2. Scale the vector by $-2$: \nMultiplying the vector by $-2$:\n$-2(3 - 3i) = (-2)(3) + (-2)(-3)i = -6 + 6i$\n\n3. Find the image of $2i$ by adding the scaled vector to the center:\n$(-1 + 4i) + (-6 + 6i) = (-1 - 6) + (4 - 3 + 6)i = -7 + 7i$\n\nSo, the dilation takes $2i$ to $\\boxed{-7 + 7i}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. First, let's understand what a dilation is. A dilation is a transformation that changes the size of a figure, but not its shape. In this case, we're dilating around a point (center), with a scale factor of $-2$. This means that the distance from the center to the figure will be doubled and the direction will be reversed.\n\n2. We are given a complex number $2i$, and we need to find the image of this point under the dilation.\n\n3. The center of dilation is given as $-1 + 4i$. To find the image of the point, we need to subtract the center from the point and then multiply it by the scale factor.\n\nLet $z_1 = -1 + 4i$ (center of dilation) and $z_2 = 2i$ (the given point).\n\nThe scale factor is $k = -2$.\n\nWe want to find the image of point $z_2$ under the dilation, which is the point $z_3$. To do this, we'll use the formula:\n\n$z_3 = k(z_2 - z_1) + z_1$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n$z_3 = -2(2i - (-1 + 4i)) + (-1 + 4i)$\n\nFirst, simplify the expression:\n\n$z_3 = -2(2i + 1 - 4i) + (-1 + 4i)$\n$z_3 = -2(-2i + 1) + (-1 + 4i)$\n$z_3 = 4i - 2 + (-1 + 4i)$\n\nNow, simplify further:\n\n$z_3 = 4i - 2 - 1 + 4i$\n$z_3 = 8i - 3$\n\nSo, the image of the point $2i$ under the dilation is $\\boxed{8i - 3}$.",
    "To find the complex number that $2i$ is mapped to, we first need to understand the concept of dilation and how it applies to complex numbers.\n\nGiven that the dilation is centered at $-1 + 4i$ and has a scale factor of $-2$, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Translate the center of dilation to the origin by subtracting the center's complex number from $2i$.\n\nThe translation involves moving the center of dilation to the point $(0,0)$, which means we need to subtract the complex number of the center of dilation ($-1 + 4i$) from $2i$. Let's do this.\n\nTo translate the center of dilation to the origin, we need to calculate $(2i) - (-1 + 4i)$.\n\nUsing the translation rule, we have:\n\n$(2i) - (-1 + 4i) = -1 + 6i$\n\nNow that the center of dilation is translated to the origin, we can proceed with the dilation.\n\n2. Apply the dilation with a scale factor of $-2$ to $-1 + 6i$.\n\nIn this step, we apply the scale factor to the translated point $-1 + 6i$.\n\nUsing the scale factor, we multiply $-1 + 6i$ by $-2$.\n\nWe have:\n\n$-2 \\cdot (-1 + 6i) = 2 - 12i$\n\nTo reverse the translation from step 1, we now need to add the complex number of the center of dilation ($-1 + 4i$) to the result of dilation ($2 - 12i$).\n\n3. Translate everything back to the original position by adding the negative translation to $2 - 12i$.\n\nWe had translated the point $(2i)$ to $-1 + 6i$. To reverse this, we now need to move the result of dilation ($2 - 12i$) by the negative translation.\n\nTo do this, we calculate $(2 - 12i) + (-1 + 4i)$.\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n\n$(2 - 1) + (-12i + 4i) = 1 - 8i$\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1 - 8i}$."
