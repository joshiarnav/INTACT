    "To find $\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right)$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the angle to a positive angle: \nWe can rewrite $-\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$ as $\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} + \\pi$. \n\n2. Use the periodic property of tangent:\nThe tangent function has a period of $\\pi$, which means that $\\tan(\\theta) = \\tan(\\theta + \\pi)$ for any angle $\\theta$. Therefore, we can simplify the expression $\\tan \\left( \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} + \\pi \\right)$ to $\\tan \\left( \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right)$.\n\n3. Use the reference angle:\nThe reference angle is $\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} - \\pi = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. This angle is in the second quadrant, where the tangent function is positive.\n\n4. Find the value of the tangent:\nWe know that $\\tan \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) = 1$. Since the tangent function is positive in the second quadrant, $\\tan \\left( -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) = \\tan \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) = 1$.",
    "To find $\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right)$, we can use the property of tangent function that it is an odd function. This means that $\\tan(-\\theta) = -\\tan(\\theta)$ for any angle $\\theta$. \n\nFirst, let's convert the given angle to degrees for easier understanding. Since $\\pi$ radians is equivalent to $180^\\circ$, we can convert the angle as follows:\n$\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} = \\frac{180^\\circ}{\\pi} \\times \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} = 135^\\circ$\n\nNow, we have $\\tan \\left( 135^\\circ \\right)$. The tangent function has a periodicity of $180^\\circ$ (or $\\pi$ radians). The reference angle for $135^\\circ$ is $45^\\circ$ because it lies in the second quadrant where tangent values are positive, but we need to consider the quadrant for the actual angle.\n\nSince the given angle is in the third quadrant, which is a negative value from the standard first quadrant, it makes the angle greater than 180 degrees and thus making the angle 135 degrees positive and noting when the angle is in Quadrant 3 it's a negative value which may change some properties of that tangent why may need to do some some steps into getting values into Quadrant one for all it's properties.  \n\nNow that we have our reference, we can find the tangent of the reference angle (45\u00b0), which is known to be $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nSince the given angle lies in the third quadrant, the tangent value will be negative. Thus, we have $\\tan \\left( 135^\\circ \\right) = -\\tan(45^\\circ) = -1$\n\nPutting it all together: $\\boxed{-1}$.",
    "To find $\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right),$ we can use the fact that the tangent function is an odd function. An odd function satisfies the equation $f(-x) = -f(x).$ \n\nApplying this to our problem, we can write $\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right)$ as $-\\tan \\left( \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right).$\n\nNow, to find $\\tan \\left( \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right),$ we can use the unit circle to find the coordinates of the point on the unit circle that makes an angle of $\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$ with the positive x-axis.\n\nThe unit circle has a radius of 1 and passes through the points $(1,0),$ $(0,1),$ $(-1,0),$ and $(0,-1).$ \n\nA quarter of the circle corresponds to an angle of $\\frac{ \\pi}{2},$ and the x coordinate is positive, while the y-coordinate is positive.\n\nA full circle corresponds to an angle of $2  \\pi,$ while a half circle corresponds to an angle of $\\pi.$ \n\nFor an angle of $\\frac{3  \\pi}{4},$ we need an additional $\\frac{ \\pi}{4}$ of the unit circle.\n\nAs we move $\\frac{ \\pi}{4}$ clockwise through the unit circle, we move through $\\frac{ \\pi}{4}$ of a circle.\n\nA tangent to the unit circle that intersects with the x-axis can be used to create a right triangle with a hypotenuse of length 1.\n\nUsing this right triangle, the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle is $\\cos \\frac{3 \\pi}{4}.$ Since the $\\cos \\theta$ is negative in both the second and third quadrants of the unit circle, which make up the angles with acute and obtuse definition. Since this value is situated within the second quadrant angle of $\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$, the value is in fact negative, and is equal to $\\cos \\frac{3 \\pi}{4}=\\cos \\left( \\pi+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=\\cos(\\pi)\\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)-\\sin(\\pi)\\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=\\left(-1\\right)\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}-0\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}=-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}.$\n\nSimilarly, the y-coordinate of the point on the unit circle can be found as $\\sin \\frac{3 \\pi}{4}.$ Since the $\\sin \\theta$ is positive in both the first and second quadrants of the unit circle. Since this value is situated within the second quadrant angle of $\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$, the value is in fact positive, and is equal to $\\sin \\frac{3 \\pi}{4}=\\sin \\left( \\pi+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=\\sin(\\pi)\\cos\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)+\\cos(\\pi)\\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=0\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}-1\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}=-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}.$\n\nThus, $\\cos \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $\\sin \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}.$\n\nThe tangent function is defined as the ratio of the sine function to the cosine function, so we can find $\\tan \\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$ as:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\tan \\left( \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) &= \\frac{ \\sin \\left( \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) }{ \\cos \\left( \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) }\\\\\n&= \\frac{ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} }{ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} }\\\\\n&= \\boxed{1}\n\\end{align*}\n\nRecalling that $\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) = -\\tan \\left( \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right)$, we have\n\n$$\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) = -\\tan \\left( \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) = \\boxed{-1}$$"
