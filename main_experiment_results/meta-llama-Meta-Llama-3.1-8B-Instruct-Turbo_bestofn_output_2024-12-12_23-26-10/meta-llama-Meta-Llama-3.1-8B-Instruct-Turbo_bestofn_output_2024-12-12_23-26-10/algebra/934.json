    "To find the value of $a$, we need to first express the quadratic in vertex form, which is given by the equation $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex. In this case, the vertex is $(-4, 0)$, so we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$y = a(x + h)^2 + k$\n$y = a(x + 4)^2 + 0$\n$y = a(x + 4)^2$\n\nNow, we know that the parabola passes through the point $(1, -75)$. We can substitute the coordinates of this point into the equation to find the value of $a$:\n\n$-75 = a(1 + 4)^2$\n$-75 = a(5)^2$\n$-75 = 25a$\n\nTo find the value of $a$, we can divide both sides of the equation by 25:\n\n$a = -75/25$\n$a = -3$\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{-3}$.",

    "To find the value of $a$, we need to use the given vertex and the point the parabola passes through to find the equation of the parabola.\n\nStep 1:  The vertex form of a quadratic equation is $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola. In this case, the vertex is $(-4, 0)$, so we can write the equation as $y = a(x + 4)^2 + 0 = a(x + 4)^2$.\n\nStep 2:  We are also given that the parabola passes through the point $(1, -75)$. We can substitute this point into the equation to find the value of $a$. Plugging in $x = 1$ and $y = -75$ into the equation $y = a(x + 4)^2$, we get $a(1 + 4)^2 = -75$.\n\nStep 3:  Simplifying the equation $a(1 + 4)^2 = -75$, we have $a(5)^2 = -75$.\n\nStep 4:  Solving for $a$, we have $a(25) = -75$.\n\nStep 5:  Dividing both sides by $25$, we get $a = -75/25$.\n\nStep 6:  Simplifying the fraction, we have $a = -3$.\n\nSo, the value of $a$ is $-3$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They all arrive at the same answer, $a = -3$. However, I will analyze each solution for clarity, concision, and adherence to mathematical principles.\n\nSolution 1 is a good example of how to rewrite a quadratic equation in vertex form and then substitute the given point to solve for the unknown variable. It is clear and easy to follow.\n\nSolution 2 is very similar to Solution 1, with some minor differences in wording and formatting. It also clearly and concisely solves the problem.\n\nSolution 3 is a bit more verbose and breaks down the solution into more steps than necessary. However, it still clearly and correctly solves the problem.\n\nBased on the analysis, I would recommend Solution 1 as the best solution. It is clear, concise, and directly addresses the problem.",
  "solution": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic must be of the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$.  The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, which gives us the equation $-75 = 25a$.  Hence, $a = -75/25 = \\boxed{-3}$.",
