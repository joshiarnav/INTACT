    "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $7!$ and $(5!)^2$, we first need to calculate their prime factorizations.\n\n$7!$ can be written as:\n\n$7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n$7! = 7 \\times (2 \\times 3) \\times 5 \\times (2^2) \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$\n\nNow, let's simplify it using exponent rules:\n\n$7! = 7 \\times 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5$\n\nNow, moving on to $(5!)^2$:\n\n$(5!)^2 = (5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1)^2$\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n$(5!)^2 = (5 \\times (2 \\times 3) \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1)^2$\n\nSimplifying it using exponent rules, we get:\n\n$(5!)^2 = (5 \\times 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 2)^2$\n\nExpanding this further, we get:\n\n$(5!)^2 = (2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2)$\n\nNow, we can compare the prime factorizations of $7!$ and $(5!)^2$. \n\nFrom $7! = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5$, we have the prime factors $2^4$, $3^2$, and $5$. \n\nFrom $(5!)^2 = (2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2)$, we see that we have $2^4$, $3^2$, and $5^2$ as the prime factors.\n\nTo find the GCD, we take the lowest exponent of each shared prime factor, which are $2^4$, $3^2$, and $5$.\n\nHence, the GCD of $7!$ and $(5!)^2$ is:\n\n$\\boxed{2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 = 720}$"
