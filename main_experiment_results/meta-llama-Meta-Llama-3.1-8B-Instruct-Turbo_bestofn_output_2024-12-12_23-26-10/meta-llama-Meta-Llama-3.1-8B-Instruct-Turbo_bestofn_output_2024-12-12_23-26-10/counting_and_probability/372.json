    "To find the number of possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between, we first need to understand that the arrangement of people at a circular table is rotational, so the starting point doesn't matter. \n\nIn her possible pairs of people between which Cara is sitting, the two people can be in any order. If we pick any two people, it doesn't matter if they are on the left or right of Cara, as long as the pair consists of two of her friends. \n\nSo, we need to find the number of combinations of 2 people from a group of 5 people.\n\nThe number of combinations of 2 people from a group of 5 can be calculated using the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nHere n is the total number of items (5), and k is the number of items to choose (2).\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5 - 2)!)\n= 5! / (2!3!)\n= 5*4*3*2/2 * 1 * 2\n= 120 / 4\n= 30\n\nHowever, as I mentioned earlier, the arrangement of people at a circular table is rotational, so we have to divide by the number of possible rotations of these pairs, which is 2 (since each pair can be rotated as a unit). \n\nHowever, there are 2 scenarios where this doesn't work. Consider when we choose her friend sitting in the position shown as * and the other person; in this case they are considered one pair whether shown as left or right. This gives us 2*2 arrangements for that one position, so when picking a friend for the second position it gives us 3!/(2*1) arrangements. However, it's more generally to simply remove the rotational symmetry when calculating pairs that can be seen as being on either side, then to take what ever number is achieved then to divide this by 2, as pairs are indistinguishable in rotation.\n\nSo, the number of possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between is 30 / 2.\n= 15.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{15}$.",
    "To find the number of different possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between, we need to choose 2 people out of her 5 friends. \n\nThe formula for combinations is $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. \n\nIn this case, $n = 5$ (number of friends) and $k = 2$ (number of people to choose). \n\nFirst, let's calculate $5!$ which is equal to $5\\times4\\times3\\times2\\times1=120$. \n\nThen, let's calculate $2!$ which equals $2\\times1=2$. \n\nFinally, let's calculate $(5-2)!$, also known as $3!$ which is equal to $3\\times2\\times1=6$. \n\nNow we can substitute these values into the combinations formula: \n\n$C(5, 2) = \\frac{120}{2\\times6}$. \n\nNow we can simplify the expression: \n\n$C(5, 2) = \\frac{120}{12}$\n\n$C(5, 2) = 10$. \n\nTherefore, Cara can be sitting between 10 different possible pairs of people. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",
    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Since the table is circular, Cara can be sitting between any of her 5 friends. So we have 5 options for the first person (let's say person A).\n\nStep 2: After choosing person A, we are left with 4 people. For person B, there are 4 possible choices (since the table is circular and we can't differentiate between the left and right).\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of different possible pairs of people that Cara could be sitting between. This means we need to choose 2 people from the remaining 5 friends.\n\nStep 3: We can use the combination formula for this: $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$ where $n$ is the total number of people and $r$ is the number of people we are choosing. Here, $n = 5$ (Cara is also present) and $r = 2$.\n\nApplying the formula, we get: $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n\nHowever, in the diagram, we still need to take into consideration Cara's position at the table in order to calculate her possible pairs with her surrounding friends on the table. Since Cara could be seated on any side of her first chosen friend, this also means she can have 2 pairs with that friend. When considering the reverse, Cara's pairs multiply by 2 with every person at the table. \n\nStep 4: To calculate this, each friend on the circular table on the right side will be doubled with their respective friend on the left side of the table with Cara. So if we start counting pairs from friend A we have 2 pairs with A, A corresponds to 2 with friend B and B corresponds to 2 with C. we can see a pattern here. \n\nStep 5: We can now divide the total number of pairs with each person we counted, we counted 10 pairs with A, B corresponds to $\\frac{10}{2} = 5$ and C corresponds to $\\frac{5}{2}$.  \nThis corresponds to 2 with every person counted, with every possible person we have 10 on each one on the circle: (- (-1 corresponds with - (- (-1 corresponds to -1 on the circular table  -this was used earlier to (-1 we have, that on the -this also, could that create that on the: = (-1 with each on the left of Kara on the circular table -).\n\nStep 6: Therefore the total number of pairs possible is $10 + 5 +2  +1 = 18$"

  "solution": "The number of pairs of neighbors for Cara actually has nothing to do with the shape of the table she is sitting at.
