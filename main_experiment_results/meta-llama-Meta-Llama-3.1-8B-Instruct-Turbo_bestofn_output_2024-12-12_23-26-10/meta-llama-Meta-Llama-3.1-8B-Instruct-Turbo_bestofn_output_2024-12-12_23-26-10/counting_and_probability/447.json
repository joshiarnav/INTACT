    "To find the number of ways Karl can select four crayons from a box of 12, we can use the concept of combinations. The order in which he draws them does not matter, so we need to find the number of combinations of 4 items from a set of 12.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, 12 crayons), k is the number of items to be selected (in this case, 4 crayons), and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nLet's calculate the number of combinations:\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4!(12-4)!)\n= 12! / (4! * 8!)\n= (12*11*10*9) / (4*3*2*1)\n= 11,880 / 24\n= 495\n\nSo, there are 495 ways Karl can select four crayons from a box of 12.\n\n$\\boxed{495}$",

    "To find the number of ways Karl can select four crayons, we are dealing with combinations since the order does not matter. The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (crayons), k is the number of items to be chosen (selected crayons), and '!' denotes factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 12 (total number of crayons), and k = 4 (number of crayons to be selected).\n\nFirst, we calculate the factorial of n (12!), which is:\n12! = 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1\n= 479,001,600\n\nNow, we calculate the factorial of k (4!), which is:\n4! = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1\n= 24\n\nNext, we calculate the factorial of (n-k), which is (12-4) = 8!:\n8! = 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1\n= 40,320\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nC(12, 4) = 479,001,600 / (24 \u00d7 40,320)\n= 479,001,600 / 967,680\n= 495\n\nSo, there are $\\boxed{495}$ ways Karl can select four crayons from the box."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. \n\nHowever, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nSolution 1 is the most concise and straightforward solution. It directly applies the combination formula to the problem without unnecessary calculations. It also provides a clear explanation of the concept of combinations and how it applies to the problem.\n\nSolution 2 is almost identical to Solution 1, but it uses a different notation for the combination formula (C(n, r) instead of C(n, k)). \n\nSolution 3 is also correct, but it involves unnecessary calculations of the factorials of 12 and 8, which are not needed to solve the problem. \n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",
