    "To find the largest 2-digit prime factor of ${200\\choose 100}$, we can first simplify the expression using factorials.\n\n${200\\choose 100}$ can be expressed as $\\frac{200!}{100!(200-100)!} = \\frac{200!}{100!100!}$.\n\nWe can further simplify this as $\\frac{200*199*198*...*101}{100!}$.\n\nSince factorials grow rapidly and are composed of many factors of 2 and 5 (especially factors of 5), the primes that divide ${200\\choose 100}$ will mostly be the primes less than 100 that are not factors of 100 (i.e., factors not in 100!'s denominator, or the prime factors).\n\nTherefore we can consider the prime factors of ${200\\choose 100}$ to be those primes less than 100, excluding 2, 5, and integers that serve as factors of other prime factors, (in the specific case of this problem though, no exclusion of the latter set will aid in simplification). This number of factors though is large, so we'll only need to consider divisibility and prime factor test rules based on prime number distribution characteristics (primality testing and prime number density, in relation to simplex co-primes).\n\nSpecifically, we need to check the divisibility of primes up to 97 that may appear in the numerator. \n\nThis can be broken down into checking several primes in the numerator that divide the denominator as evenly as possible and prime number density, to see how many are co-primes relative to our situation here.\n\nPrimes less than 100 that could serve as factors, in order of divisibility (potential factor of ${200\\choose 100}$) are: 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.\n\nUsing a factorization, ${200\\choose 100}$ is divisible by any such that may properly be defined with simplex integers like p=79, and its power, in this problem primes serve their funtional roles.\n\np=79 is the largest 2-digit prime less than 100 which divides n.\n\n Thus, the value to be presented in the requested problem format is:\n \n$\\boxed{79}$",

    "To find the largest 2-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$, we first need to calculate the value of $n$. \n\nThe binomial coefficient ${n\\choose k}$ is given by the formula ${n\\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.\n\nSubstituting in $n=200$, $k=100$, we get ${200\\choose 100} = \\frac{200!}{100!(200-100)!}$.\n\nThis can be simplified as ${200\\choose 100} = \\frac{200!}{100!100!}$.\n\nTo calculate this, we need to know that $200! = 200\\times 199\\times 198\\times \\cdots \\times 1$, $100! = 100\\times 99\\times 98\\times \\cdots \\times 1$.\n\nHowever, we don't need to actually calculate the entire factorial. \n\nBecause we're looking for the largest 2-digit prime factor, we should focus on finding the factorization of $n$.\n\nWe know that $200!$ is the product of all the numbers from 1 to 200.
