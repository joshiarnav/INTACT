  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and arrive at the same answer of 8 different flags possible. However, Solution 1 is the most concise and straightforward, clearly explaining the thought process and arriving at the solution in a simple and easy-to-follow manner.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1.",
