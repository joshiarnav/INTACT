Non-composite numbers:\n   We can get a non-composite product by having:\n   - A 1 as a factor in the product.

    "To find the probability of rolling a composite number, we can count the number of non-composite outcomes and subtract that from the total number of outcomes. \n\nFirst, let's understand the total number of outcomes. When rolling 5 dice, we have $6^5 = 7776$ total possible outcomes.\n\nNow, let's consider the cases where we get a non-composite number. Non-composite numbers (also known as prime numbers) are those that have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. For a non-composite number to result from rolling the dice, at least four dice must be 1s, and the fifth die can be any number except 1, or 1 for all dice, but if all dice are 1, then the result would be 1, which is not non-composite.\n\nLet's count the number of outcomes for the five non-composite cases and their variations:\n\n1. Exactly 4 dice are 1s, and 1 die is not:\n- We choose which die is not a 1 in $\\binom{5}{1}=5$ ways. \n- The non-1 can be any non-1 number (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).\nTherefore, the total number of ways we can roll 4 dice as 1 and the fifth die as a non-1 is $\\binom{5}{1}\\times 5=25$.\n\n2. Exactly 3 dice are 1s and 2 dice are not in (a) two different primes (b), Prime (4) and another prime (a different value between the other 3), (c) Two 2s, and the last die is a prime and in each case, one has the fifth die being a prime number:\n- For (a) exactly 2 nondes of the same value, we can choose those nondes in $2\\cdot \\binom{4}{1}{2}=8$, 1 pair that can\u2019t form a composite in $\\binom{4}{2}{2, 3}$ for 2, 3, and all values also are primes and $\\frac{4}{2}=2$, total / noncomp in pair. Given that in (a) the value for the 3 non-1 dice is 2 and 3; also what value is the other 2 1 dice (and non-1 Prime). Total = $2\\cdot 2 \\times\\binom{4}{2} {2} = 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 6 = 24$\n\n- In (b) non-1 can be either a, 2 for the nonon composite value, Given that the case where Prime for non-1 has 2 nondes in different prime values in between the other 3 dice, with Primes non-1 Prime. two pairs of the same nondes 3 and 4 values and in a non-1 case one and 3 and 4 discernible 3 / non-1 in pair.

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I found that Solution 2 is the most correct and efficient solution. Here's why:\n\nSolution 1 is incomplete, as it only counts the cases where the product is not composite by considering the cases where at least four dice are 1 and the fifth die is either another 1 or a prime number. However, it does not consider the cases where the product is not composite but not all dice are 1.\n\nSolution 3 is very long-winded and contains many errors in its calculations. It tries to count the number of non-composite outcomes by considering various cases, but it makes mistakes in its counting and does not provide a clear or efficient solution.\n\nSolution 2, on the other hand, provides a clear and efficient solution by first counting the number of non-composite outcomes and then subtracting that from the total number of outcomes to find the number of composite outcomes. It correctly identifies the cases where the product is not composite, and its calculations are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 2",
  "solution": "While it is almost tempting to make this into the casework problem to end all casework problems, using complementary probability makes the problem a lot simpler, so we will find the probability that the product is not composite.\n\nIt's clear that if more than one die shows a roll greater than 1, the resulting product will have more than one factor that is greater than 1 and therefore be composite. Additionally, if any of the dice show a 4 or a 6, the product will obviously be composite. So in order for the product to not be composite, we need at least four dice to be a 1 and the fifth die to either be another 1 or a 2, a 3, or a 5.\n\nThere's exactly one way in which all the the dice can be 1's, and for each of the other three cases there are 5 ways since the die that isn't a 1 can appear in any of the 5 other positions, so there are a total of $3\\cdot5+1=16$ ways of rolling the dice that result in a product that isn't composite. Additionally, there are 6 options for the roll of each of the 5 dice for a total of $6^5=7776$ possible outcomes, which means that the probability of the product not being composite is $\\dfrac{16}{7776}$ and the probability that it is composite is $1-\\frac{16}{7776}=\\frac{7760}{7776}=\\boxed{\\frac{485}{486}}$.\n\nNote: Many students have tried to argue that 1 is not a prime number and should not be counted. As we are doing complementary probability, it is important to consider all numbers that are not composite, and 1 is definitely not composite.",
