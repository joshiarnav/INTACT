    "The problem involves a triangle $PQR$ and a circle with center $C$. Given that $\\angle PQR = 63^\\circ$ and $\\angle QPR = 59^\\circ$, we can find $\\angle QRC$.\n\nStep 1: The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always $180^\\circ$. This implies that $\\angle P = 180^\\circ - \\angle QPR - \\angle PQR$.\n\nStep 2: Substituting the values of $\\angle QPR = 59^\\circ$ and $\\angle PQR = 63^\\circ$, we have $\\angle P = 180^\\circ - 59^\\circ - 63^\\circ = 58^\\circ$.\n\nStep 3: Since the triangle $PQR$ is inscribed in a circle, $C$ is the incenter of triangle $PQR$. In a triangle with incenter $C$, the angle bisectors of the triangle meet at $C$.\n\nStep 4: The line segment $RC$ is the angle bisector of $\\angle P$.\n\nStep 5: The angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite angle into two equal angles, which can be represented as $\\angle QRC = \\frac{1}{2}\\angle P$.\n\nStep 6: As the value of $\\angle P$ is known, we can find the value of $\\angle QRC$ by halving $\\angle P$.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the value of $\\angle QRC$ is $\\boxed{29^\\circ}$.",
    "To find the angle $\\angle QRC$, we need to know the angle $\\angle RQC$ first. \n\nStep 1: Since $PQ$ and $PR$ are tangents to the circle with center $C$, we can draw a line from $C$ to the point of tangency with $PQ$ and another line from $C$ to the point of tangency with $PR$. \n\nNow, let's call the point of tangency with $PQ$ as $D$, and the point of tangency with $PR$ as $E$. \n\nSince $C$ is the center of the circle, $CD$ and $CE$ are perpendicular to $PQ$ and $PR$ respectively.\n\nStep 2: Now, let's look at triangle $PQR$. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we can write:\n\n$\\angle PQR + \\angle QPR + \\angle QRP = 180^\\circ$\n\nWe are given that $\\angle PQR = 63^\\circ$ and $\\angle QPR = 59^\\circ$. We can plug these values into the equation above to find $\\angle QRP$.\n\n$\\angle QRP = 180^\\circ - \\angle PQR - \\angle QPR$\n$\\angle QRP = 180^\\circ - 63^\\circ - 59^\\circ$\n$\\angle QRP = 58^\\circ$\n\nStep 3: Now, since $CQ$ is perpendicular to $PQ$, we have $CQ \\perp PQ$. \n\nAlso, since $CE$ is perpendicular to $PR$, we have $CE \\perp PR$. \n\nTherefore, $\\angle QRP = \\angle QRC + \\angle QRP$\n\n$\\angle QRC = \\angle QRP$\n$\\angle QRC = 58^\\circ$\n\nBut $\\angle QRP$ is not the same as $\\angle QRC$, we have $\\angle QRC = 180^\\circ - \\angle PQR - \\angle QRP$\n\nSince $\\angle QRP = \\angle QRC$ doesn't apply, we have \n$\\angle QRC = 180^\\circ - \\angle PQR - \\angle QRC$\n\nUsing the formula for sum of an angle in triangle above we get\n$\\angle QRC + \\angle QRC + \\angle PQR = 180^\\circ$\n\nSimplifying it we get\n$2\\cdot \\angle QRC  = 180^\\circ - \\angle PQR$\nNow we can plug the value of $\\angle PQR$ \nSo we have  $2\\cdot \\angle QRC = 180^\\circ - 63^\\circ$\nSimplifying we get\n$2\\cdot \\angle QRC = 117^\\circ$\n\nDividing by 2 from both sides\n\n$\\angle QRC = 58.5^\\circ$\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{58.5}$.",
    "To find $\\angle QRC$, we need to find the properties of the incenter $C$ and use the given angles of the triangle $PQR$. \n\nStep 1:  Find the third angle of triangle $PQR$ using the fact that the sum of interior angles of any triangle is $180^\\circ$.\n$\\angle PRQ = 180^\\circ - 63^\\circ - 59^\\circ$\n$= 180^\\circ - 122^\\circ$\n$= 58^\\circ$\n\nStep 2:  Since the sides of triangle $PQR$ are tangent to the circle, the incenter $C$ is the intersection point of the angle bisectors. \n\nStep 3:  The incenter $C$ is the circumcenter of the triangle formed by the intersection points of the incircle with the sides of the triangle. Hence, $CQ$, $CP$, and $CR$ bisect each other. \n\nStep 4:  Therefore, the line segment $CR$ is equal to the line segment $CP$ and has length equal to the radius of the circle. Also, we can say that $CQ$ is equal to the line segment $CR$ and has the same length (i.e., half of $PR$).\n\nStep 5:  We are looking for the angle $\\angle QRC$.\n\nStep 6:  Because line segments $PQ$ and $CR$ bisect each other and $CP = CR$ are of equal length, the angle $\\angle PQC$ must be the same as the angle $\\angle QRC$. Also, $PQC$ is a straight line.\n\nStep 7:  Obtaining the properties of the angles of the triangle and how the line segments are equal length, we can calculate the value of the required angle.\n\nThe supplement of $\\angle QPR$  is the angle we need, since $\\angle QPR + \\angle QRP + \\angle PRQ = 180^\\circ$, we can write:\n$180^\\circ - \\angle QPR - \\angle PRQ = \\angle QRP$\n$180^\\circ - \\angle QPR - 58^\\circ = \\angle QRP$\n$\\angle QRP = 180^\\circ - 59^\\circ - 58^\\circ$\n$\\angle QRP = 63^\\circ$\n\nHowever this does not give us the required angle.  Instead we need to consider the circle with center $C$. Here  $\\angle PQR$ and $\\angle QRP$ must share a point on circumference of the circle then $\\angle QRC$ is:\n $\\angle QRC = \\angle PRQ$\n $\\angle QRC = 58^\\circ$\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{58}$."
