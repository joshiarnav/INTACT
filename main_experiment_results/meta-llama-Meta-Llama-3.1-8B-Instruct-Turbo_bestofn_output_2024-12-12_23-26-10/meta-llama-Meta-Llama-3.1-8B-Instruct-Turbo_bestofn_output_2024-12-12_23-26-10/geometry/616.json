    "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to consider the properties of a triangle and the given side lengths.\n\nStep 1: According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nStep 2: We are given two sides of the triangle, one is 5 units and the other is 6 units. The length of the third side is x units, where x is an integer.\n\nStep 3: Using the triangle inequality theorem, we can write the following inequalities:\n\n- 5 + 6 > x (since 5 and 6 are two sides, their sum should be greater than the third side)\n- 5 + x > x (this will always be true since the sum of 5 and x will be greater than x)\n- 6 + x > 5 (since 6 and x should be greater than 5)\n\nSimplifying the inequalities, we get:\n\n- 11 > x\n- 5 + x > x (always true, no constraint on x)\n- x > -1 (since 6 + x > 5)\n\nFrom the first inequality, we know that x should be less than 11. However, if x were exactly 11, the perimeter would be equal to the sum of the other two sides, which is not the largest possible perimeter.\n\nStep 4: To find the largest possible perimeter, we can try the largest value of x less than 11, which is 10. However, before we do that, we must ensure that the triangle will actually exist. The third side, x, cannot be equal to 5 + 6, which is 11, nor can it be less than or equal to 5 or 6. Since 10 is a value between 5 and 11 but not equal to either, it will give the largest perimeter without violating the triangle inequality.\n\nStep 5: Now we can calculate the largest possible perimeter by adding the given side lengths and the largest possible value of x. In this case, the largest possible perimeter is the sum of 5, 6, and the largest value of x which is 10.\n\nPerimeter = 5 + 6 + 10\nPerimeter = 21\n\nSo the largest possible perimeter of the triangle is 21 units.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{21}$.",
    "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to follow the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nGiven sides are 5 and 6 units, and the third side is $x$ units.\n\nThe triangle inequality theorem gives us three conditions:\n1. $x$ + 5 > 6\n2. $x$ + 6 > 5\n3. 5 + 6 > $x$\n\nSimplifying these conditions, we get:\n1. $x$ > 1\n2. $x$ > -1 (this is always true since $x$ is a positive integer)\n3. $x$ < 11\n\nSince $x$ must be an integer, the possible values of $x$ range from 2 to 10.\n\nTo find the largest possible perimeter, we want to maximize $x$, so we choose $x$ = 10.\n\nThe largest possible perimeter is then 5 + 6 + 10 = 21 units.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{21}$.",

  "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",
