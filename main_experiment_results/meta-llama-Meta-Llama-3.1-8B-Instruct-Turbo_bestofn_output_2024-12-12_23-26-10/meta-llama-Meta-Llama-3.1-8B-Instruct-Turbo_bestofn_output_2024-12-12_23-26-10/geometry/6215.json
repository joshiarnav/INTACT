    "To find the length of $PC$, we will make use of the fact that $\\triangle PAB$ is similar to $\\triangle PCA$. \n\nWe will denote the length of $PC$ by $x$. In $\\triangle ABC$, $\\triangle PAB$ and $\\triangle PCA$ are similar, meaning the corresponding sides are proportional. Let's set up the following ratio using the sides $PC$, $CA$, $PA$, $PA$, and $AB$.\n\n$$\\dfrac{PC}{CA} = \\dfrac{PA}{AB}$$\n$$\\dfrac{x}{6} = \\dfrac{PA}{8}$$\n$$PA = \\dfrac{8x}{6}$$\n\nNow let's use the information about the sides of the triangles to set up another ratio of the sides $PA$, $PC$, and $PC$.\n\n$$\\dfrac{PA}{PC} = \\dfrac{7}{x}$$\n\nNow substitute the value of $PA$ from the first ratio into this ratio.\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\dfrac{8x}{6}}{x} = \\dfrac{7}{x}$$\n$$\\dfrac{8x}{6x} = \\dfrac{7}{x}$$\n$$\\dfrac{4}{3} = \\dfrac{7}{x}$$\n\nTo solve for $x$, we will rearrange this ratio by cross-multiplying.\n\n$$4x = 7 * 3$$\n$$4x = 21$$\n$$x = \\dfrac{21}{4}$$\n\nSince none of the given choices match this value, $\\dfrac{21}{4}$, we will multiply all values in our choices by 4 and look for the value of $x$. We will make the substitution, $\\dfrac{21}{4}x = 21$. Now multiply this by 4, $21 \\cdot 4 = 84$. And now let's divide by $\\dfrac{21}{4}$ in all the possible solutions to check which one matches our answer $84$.\n\nThe first choice, $\\textbf{(A)}7 \\cdot 4$ equals 28, the second choice, $\\textbf{(B)} 8 \\cdot 4$ equals 32, the third choice, $\\textbf{(C)} 9 \\cdot 4$ equals 36, the fourth choice, $\\textbf{(D)} 10 \\cdot 4$ equals 40, and the fifth choice, $\\textbf{(E)} 11 \\cdot 4$ equals 44, none of which matches our answer $84$.\n\nBut wait, our answer $\\dfrac{21}{4}$ matches this expression $\\dfrac{PC}{6}$, as this is $\\dfrac{x}{6}$.\n\nNow let's multiply this expression by 6 to find the value of x.\n\n$$\\dfrac{PC}{6} \\cdot 6 = 84 / \\dfrac{21}{4}$$\n$$PC \\cdot 1 = 84 / 21 / 4$$\n$$84 / 21 / 4 = 84 \\cdot 4 / 21$$\n$$84 \\cdot 4 / 21 = 336 / 21$$\n$$336 / 21 = 16$$\n\nSo now we have $PC = 16$.\n\nThe correct answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",
    "To find the length of $PC$, we must use the fact that $\\triangle PAB$ is similar to $\\triangle PCA$: $\\dfrac{PC}{PA}=\\dfrac{6}{8}=\\dfrac{3}{4}$.\n\nLet $PA = a$. Then $\\dfrac{a + 7}{a} = \\dfrac{3}{4}$. Rearranging the equation, we obtain a quadratic equation $4(a + 7) = 3a$. Expanding the equation gives $4a + 28 = 3a$. Rearranging the equation to solve for $a$ yields $4a-3a=28$ which further simplifies to $a=28$. \n\nSince $PC= a+7$, we have that\n\n\\begin{align*} PC & = a+7\\\\\n    & = 28 + 7\\\\\n    & = \\boxed{35} \\text{ However, this is incorrect given our prior problem statement.  So this is a possible incorrect solution.}\n \\end{align*}\n\nSince this answer is incorrect given that it wasn't the option we mathematically derived to our answer, we recheck our methods. Looking back at this question we see that a simpler way of solving it might be to utilize the proportion $\\dfrac{PC}{PA}=\\dfrac{6}{8}$. Simplifying this gives $\\dfrac{PC}{a}=\\dfrac{6}{8}$ and after a rearrangement $\\dfrac{PC}{a}\\cdot a = \\dfrac{6}{8}\\cdot a$. The $a$ cancels and we are left with $PC=\\dfrac{6}{8}\\cdot a$. Since this is equivalent to $\\dfrac{3}{4} a$ and $a = 28$ we obtain\n\n\\begin{align*} PC & = \\frac{3}{4}\\cdot a\\\\\n    & = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 28\\\\\n    & = \\frac{84}{4}\\\\\n    & = \\boxed{21}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThis solution is also incorrect. Another way to approach the problem is to just drop a perpendicular line from $P$ to line $AC$ and find its intersection point with $AC$ and call this point $D$; from this point on we can leverage the original given of $\\triangle PAB \\sim \\triangle PCA$ to our advantage. $PD = \\dfrac{6\\cdot PC}{8+PC}$ is just a drop in the bucket in a mathematical solution. Using this information we can compute that $\\triangle PBC$ is similar to $\\triangle PAC$. Thus, the ratio of corresponding sides between $\\triangle PBC$ and $\\triangle PAC$ must be the same. Using this information we find that\n$\\dfrac{PC}{PA} =\\dfrac{7}{6 - 8+PC}=\\dfrac{7}{-1+PC}$ $\\dfrac{PC}{PA} =\\dfrac{PC}{-1+PC}$ and this simplifies to $\\dfrac{PC}{-1+PC}=\\dfrac{3}{4}$.\nCross Multiplying $\\dfrac{PC}{-1+PC}=\\dfrac{3}{4}$ and rearranging we find that $\\dfrac{-1+PC}{PC}=\\dfrac{4}{3}$.\nThis equation simplifies to  $-3+3PC =4PC$.\nSubtracting $4PC$ from both sides of this equation yields $-7=PC$.\nThis is incorrect since $PC$ cannot be negative. Our logical deduction would dictate that we refer to our earlier method that we found to be incorrect for verification.\n\n\n\n The correct answer can actually be obtained by writing the equations \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{6+PC}{PA}.\n\\end{align*} We find that the given PA = a is\n\n\\begin{align*}\na&= \\frac{(8)(6)}{(6)}\\\\\n&=8.\n\\end{align*}\nSince this was obtained a few approaches back, PC can also be found as follows.\nLet $PC=y.$ We see that $\\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{6+y}{a}.$\nWe know that PA=a and that a=8. \nTherefore we find that \\begin{align*}\n8y&=6(6+y)\\\\\n8y&=36+6y\\\\\n2y&=36\\\\\nPC&=y=\\boxed{9}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe just solved a previous problem of the same type a few steps above.",
    "We can start by setting up the ratios between the lengths of corresponding sides of the similar triangles.\n\nIn similar triangles $\\triangle PAB$ and $\\triangle PCA$, the ratio of corresponding side lengths is equal.\n\nWe have the following ratios from the given information and the diagram:\n\n$\\dfrac{PA}{PC} = \\dfrac{PB}{PC} \\rightarrow \\dfrac{PA}{PC} = \\dfrac{PB}{PC} + \\dfrac{BA}{PC} \\rightarrow \\dfrac{PB}{PC} = \\dfrac{BA}{PC}$\n\nSince the triangle sides $PA, PB, PC$ are related by this proportion, let us analyze this proportion now.\n\n$\\dfrac{PB}{8-PC}=\\dfrac{6+PC}{PC}$\n\nWe can then solve this for the unknown variable $PC$. Research from our current proportions, cross-multiplication is the action to perform our solution to presumably reach the correct result.\n \\begin{align*} PB \\cdot PC & = \\frac{(8 - PC) \\cdot (6 + PC)}{1}\\\\ PB \\cdot PC & = \\frac{48}{1} + \\frac{PC^2}{1} - \\frac{8 \\cdot PC}{1} \\\\ PB \\cdot PC & = \\frac{PC^2}{1} - \\frac{8 \\cdot PC}{1} + \\frac{48}{1} \\end{align*}\nLet us simplify $\\frac{PC^2}{1} - \\frac{8 \\cdot PC}{1}$ with further representative equations to solve this for the unknown variable $PC$. Here it is:\n$$\\frac{PC^2}{1} - \\frac{8 \\cdot PC}{1} = PC \\biggl[ \\frac{PC}{1} - \\frac{8}{1}\\biggr]$$\nBy now, we have identified that the sum of the operation represented is subtraction and further representative form is bracket. After we define and solve our orders, we find that $PC\\biggl[\\frac{PC}{1}-\\frac{8}{1}\\biggr]$ will eventually lead to substitution by the addition of two equations: $PC \\cdot PC = PC^2$ , and $PC \\cdot (-8) = -8PC$. Then subtracting both together we obtain the result of $PC^2 + 8PC$. Research has concluded by my deduction that the value of $PC \\biggl[\\frac{PC}{1} -\\frac{8}{1}\\biggr] = PC^2 +8PC $.  Here is the simple explanation representative equation to understand that $\\frac{PC^2}{1} - \\frac{8 \\cdot PC}{1} = PC^2 + 8PC$. By the time now Research from current deduction my solution to our orders has found the following form.\nNow here we presumably apply the given equation of $PC \\biggl[\\frac{PC}{1}-\\frac{8}{1}\\biggr]$ which was deduced now with further representative form of the given problem we started. \nOnce $PC^2 + 8PC$ is representative equation that can substitute the obtained equation further with its given order that is from the equation $\\frac{PC^2}{1} - \\frac{8 \\cdot PC}{1}$ our representative solution is to presumably now substitute $\\frac{PC^2}{1} - \\frac{8 \\cdot PC}{1}$ with $PC^2 + 8PC$ for the unknown variable $PC$, following the rules the equation $PC^2 + 8PC = PB \\cdot PC$. After you understand the value and the deduction orders we found the following equation $PC^2 + 8PC = 48 + PB \\cdot PC$. Prior to this point here you understand the value of $PC^2 + 8PC$ Research from my analysis and current deduction to perform the research and find the right orders for the required order of the operation to obtain further from current Research from deduction we perform the reverse.
