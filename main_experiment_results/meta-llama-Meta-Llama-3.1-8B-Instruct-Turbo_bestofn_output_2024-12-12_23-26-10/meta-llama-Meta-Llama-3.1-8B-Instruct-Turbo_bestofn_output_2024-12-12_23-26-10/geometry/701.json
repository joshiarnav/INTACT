    "To find the area of the regular octagon, we can split it into a square and 4 isosceles right triangles.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the side length of the square $BDEF$. Let's denote it as $s$. \n\nSince $AB = BC = 1$, $\\triangle ABC$ is an isosceles right triangle. By the Pythagorean theorem, $AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2$. Thus, $AC = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nLooking at $\\triangle ACD$, we see that it's also an isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse $AD$ equal to $s + \\sqrt{2}$ and leg $AC$ equal to $\\sqrt{2}$. The other leg $CD$ can be calculated as $\\left(AC^2 - AD^2\\right)^{1/2}$ or more simplified, $AD - AC$. This simplifies to:\n\n$s + \\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{2}$ = $s$.\n\nThus, we know $s$ must be the length of $AC$, which is $s=\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow that we know the side length of $BDEF$ is $s=\\sqrt{2}$, let's calculate the area of the square $BDEF$. \n\n$[BDEF]=s^2=(\\sqrt{2})^2= \\boxed{2}$.\n\nHowever, we still have to account for the 4 isosceles right triangles. Each right triangle's area is $(1/2) \\times AB \\times BC = (1/2) \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since there are 4 of these isosceles right triangles, we need to multiply by 4 to get the total area of the 4 triangles.\n\nTotal area of triangles = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 = \\boxed{2}$.\n\nAdding the area of the square and the area of the triangles, we get the area of the regular octagon as:\n\nArea of the octagon = $[BDEF] + \\text{Area of right triangles} = 2 + 2 = \\boxed{4}$.",
    "To find the area of the regular octagon, we first notice that the square $BDEF$ has side length $2 + \\sqrt{2}$. We can then find the area of the square, which is $(2 + \\sqrt{2})^2 = 6 + 4\\sqrt{2}$. \n\nNow we can find the areas of the isosceles right triangles $ABC$, $ACD$, $ADE$, $ADB$, $DBC$, $BCE$, $BEF$, and $AEB$. The area of each triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nHowever, since these triangles overlap, we need to be careful not to count them twice. In particular, triangles $ADE$ and $CDB$, $BCD$ and $BEC$ overlap, and $BAC$ and $ADH$ overlap as indicated on the diagram.\n\nAs a result, when calculating the area of the octagon, we must subtract a total of $4$ of these triangles. \n\nNow the area of the octagon is given by $$(6+4\\sqrt{2})-4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 6 + 4\\sqrt{2} - 2 = \\boxed{4 + 4\\sqrt{2}}.$$",
    "To find the area of the regular octagon $ABCDEFGH,$ we can start by finding the area of square $BDEF$ and then subtract the areas of the four isosceles right triangles formed by the square and the octagon.\n\nFirst, we notice that $AB = BC = 1,$ so $AC = 1 + 1 = 2.$ \n\nSince $BDEF$ is a square, $BD = DE = EF = BF = \\sqrt{2}.$\n\nWe now want to find the side length of the octagon. $HC$ is a side of the octagon. We can find the area of triangle $ACHE$. It is a right triangle with $AC = 2$ and $CE = \\sqrt{2}$, and $HE = 1$. \n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find $HC$. $HC^2 + HE^2 = CE^2$, so $HC^2 + 1 = 2$. So $HC^2 = 1$, and $HC = 1.$ \n\nTo find the area of the octagon, we need to find the area of each of the triangles $AHC, BHD, CEH,$ and $DFG$, which are all isosceles right triangles, and subtract their areas from the area of the square $BDEF$.\n\nThe area of each of the triangles $AHC, BHD, CEH,$ and $DFG$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(HC)(CH) = \\frac{1}{2}(1)(1) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe area of the square $BDEF$ is $(BF)^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$.\n\nTo find the area of the octagon, we subtract the area of the four triangles from the area of the square: $2 - 4(\\frac{1}{2}) = 2 - 2 = 0$. This is incorrect; our method must be rechecked.\n\nLet us re-calculate. The triangles $AHC, BHD, CEH,$ and $DFG$ have a height of 1 unit and their base of $\\sqrt{2}$ unit. The area of the triangles $AHC, BHD, CEH,$ and $DFG$ is $(\\frac12)\\sqrt{2}(1)$. There are 4 such triangles, so total area of the four isosceles right triangles is $4(\\frac{1}{2})\\sqrt{2}=2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe area of the square $BDEF$ is $(\\sqrt{2})^2=2$. \n\nThe area of the octagon is the area of the square, minus the area of the four triangles, which is $2-2\\sqrt{2}$ is incorrect.\n\nThe square can be split into 4 smaller squares and 4 triangles.  The area of the square $BDEF$ is $(\\sqrt{2})^2=2$, and we can split it into 4 squares each of area $2/4=1/2$. So the area of each of the smaller squares is $(\\frac12)^2=1/4$.\n\nNow, to find the area of the octagon, we need to find the area of the square $BDEF$ and subtract the area of the 4 smaller squares that are inside the triangles from it.\n\nThe area of the square $BDEF$ is $(\\sqrt{2})^2=2$. \n\nNow we will calculate the area of the diagonals' squares. The total height of the square is $HC + AC$, that is $2$. The total height divided by the total number of squares along that diagonal is $2/4=1/2$. This is equal to the side length of each of the squares along that diagonal.
