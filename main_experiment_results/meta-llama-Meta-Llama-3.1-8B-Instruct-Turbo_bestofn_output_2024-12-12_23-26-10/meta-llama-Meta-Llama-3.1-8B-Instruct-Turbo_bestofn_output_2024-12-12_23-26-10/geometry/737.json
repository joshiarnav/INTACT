    "To find the volume of the sphere, we'll first need to find the radius of the sphere. We're given the surface area of the sphere, which is also a good place to start since it's proportional to the square of the radius.\n\nThe surface area of a sphere is given by the formula: \n\n$A = 4 \\pi r^2$\n\nWe are given that the surface area is $324\\pi$, so we can plug this value into the formula and solve for r:\n\n$324\\pi = 4 \\pi r^2$\n\nDivide both sides by $4\\pi$:\n\n$r^2 = 81$\n\nTake the square root of both sides to solve for r:\n\n$r = 9\\text{ cm}$\n\nNow that we have the radius of the sphere, we can use the volume of a sphere formula: \n\n$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$\n\nWe already have the value of r:\n\n$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (9\\text{ cm})^3$\n\nExpand:\n\n$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (729\\text{ cm}^3)$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$V = 972\\pi \\text{ cm}^3$\n\nThe volume of the sphere is $972\\pi \\text{ cm}^3$.",
    "To solve this problem, we'll start by using the formula for the surface area of a sphere, which is:\n\nSurface area = $4\\pi r^2$\n\nGiven that the surface area is $324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$, we can set up the equation:\n\n$4\\pi r^2 = 324\\pi$\n\nDividing both sides by $4\\pi$:\n\n$r^2 = 81$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n$r = 9$\n\nNow that we know the radius of the sphere, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is:\n\nVolume = $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$\n\nSubstituting the value of $r$:\n\nVolume = $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9)^3$\n\nVolume = $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(729)$\n\nVolume = $972\\pi$\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is $\\boxed{972\\pi}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we'll go step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the relationship between surface area and radius of a sphere**\n\nThe surface area of a sphere is given by the formula: $A = 4\\pi r^2$, where $A$ is the surface area and $r$ is the radius of the sphere.\n\n**Step 2: Find the radius using the given surface area**\n\nGiven the surface area $A = 324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$, we set it equal to the formula for surface area and solve for $r$:\n\n$$324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2$$\n\nNow, let's divide both sides by $4\\pi$:\n\n$$81 = r^2$$\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find $r$:\n\n$$r = \\sqrt{81} = 9\\text{ cm}$$\n\n**Step 3: Understand the relationship between radius and volume of a sphere**\n\nThe volume of a sphere is given by the formula: $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, where $V$ is the volume and $r$ is the radius of the sphere.\n\n**Step 4: Find the volume using the radius found in Step 2**\n\nNow that we know the radius is $9\\text{ cm}$, we plug it into the volume formula:\n\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$$\n\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (9)^3$$\n\nNow, let's calculate $(9)^3 = 729$, and then multiply it by $\\frac{4}{3}$ and $\\pi$:\n\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\cdot 729$$\n\n$$V = 4 \\cdot 243\\pi$$\n\n$$V = 972\\pi\\text{ cm}^3$$\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is $972\\pi\\text{ cm}^3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{972\\pi}$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They follow the same steps and arrive at the same final answer: $972\\pi\\text{ cm}^3$. However, I would recommend Solution 1 as the best solution due to its clarity and conciseness.\n\nSolution 1 is well-written, easy to follow, and includes all the necessary steps. It also includes some minor details, such as expanding the expression $(9\\text{ cm})^3$ and simplifying the final answer, which makes it more readable.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is:\n\n1",
  "solution": "Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2.\\]  Solving for $r$ and keeping the positive value yields $r^2=81$, so $r = 9$.  Hence the volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=81\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\pi = \\boxed{972\\pi}.\\]",
