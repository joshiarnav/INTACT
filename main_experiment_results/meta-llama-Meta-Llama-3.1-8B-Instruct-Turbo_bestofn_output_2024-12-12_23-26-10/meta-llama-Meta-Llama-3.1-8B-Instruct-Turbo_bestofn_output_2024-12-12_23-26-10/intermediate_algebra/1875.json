    "To find the value of the expression, let's simplify it by expanding each term. \n\n$\\left(1-\\frac12\\right)\\cdot\\left(1-\\frac13\\right)\\cdot\\left(1-\\frac14\\right)\\dotsm\\left(1-\\frac1{n+1}\\right)\\dotsm\\left(1-\\frac1{100}\\right)$\n\nUpon expanding each term, we get:\n\n$\\left(\\frac12\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac23\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac34\\right)\\dotsm\\left(\\frac{n+2}{n+1}\\right)\\dotsm\\left(\\frac{100}{99}\\right)$\n\nLet's notice a pattern here. Each term of the form $\\left(\\frac{n+2}{n+1}\\right)$ cancels with the next term $\\left(\\frac{n+1}{n}\\right)$. \n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}\\dotsm\\frac{n+1}{n}\\dotsm\\frac{100}{99}$\n\nAfter cancellation, we're left with:\n\n$\\frac{1}{99}$\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{99}}$",
    "To find the value of this product, let's start by simplifying each term. The general form of each term is $\\left(1-\\frac1{n+1}\\right)$, where $n$ ranges from $1$ to $99$. \n\nWe can rewrite each term as follows: \n\n$\\left(1-\\frac1{n+1}\\right) = \\frac{n}{n+1}$.\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression by multiplying all these terms together:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} \\dotsm \\frac{n}{n+1} \\dotsm \\frac{99}{100}$\n\nNotice that each numerator in a term matches the denominator of the next term. Thus, many of the terms in this product will cancel out, simplifying it to a more manageable form.\n\nFor instance, the $2$ in the numerator of the second term cancels with the $2$ in the denominator of the first term, and so on.\n\nAfter all the cancellations, we are left with:\n\n$\\frac{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\dotsm \\cdot 99}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot \\dotsm \\cdot 100}$\n\nHowever, we can further simplify this product since there are many common factors in both the numerator and the denominator. Specifically, there are $99$ numbers in the product, but many of these numbers appear in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nTo correctly identify the remaining factors and the actual simplification of the expression, let's notice that:\n\n$\\frac{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\dotsm \\cdot 99}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot \\dotsm \\cdot 100} = \\frac{\\cancel{2} \\cdot \\cancel{3} \\cdot \\cancel{4} \\cdot \\dotsm \\cdot 99}{\\cancel{2} \\cdot \\cancel{3} \\cdot \\cancel{4} \\cdot \\dotsm \\cdot \\cancel{99} \\cdot 100}$\n\nAfter all these cancellations, we are left with:\n\n$\\frac{1}{100}$\n\nHowever, since many factors cancelled, this might be an incorrect reduction, which can be seen by considering where in the product the reduction happened. On that case, since every number greater than $1$ in the numerator cancelled with a number in the denominator, let's correct that:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} \\dotsm \\frac{n}{n+1} \\dotsm \\frac{99}{100} = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{n}{n+1} \\dotsm \\frac{99}{100} = \\frac{1}{n+1} \\dotsm \\frac{99}{100}$\n\nTherefore, the correct reduction from the given problem should utilize this last expression for the product and continue canceling until the final answer is reached by looking at a transformation of the pattern as it unfolded.\n\nNow since we know that the reduction depends on how we reduce the given pattern and correctly identifying the remaining terms after various cancellations: \n\n$\\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{n}{n+1} \\dotsm \\frac{99}{100} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} \\dotsm \\frac{99}{100}$\n\nAnd employing this to derive a proper simplification from the overall pattern we are given and considering the simplification heuristics mentioned previously, this is the reduction we have been told and derived.\n\nHence,\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{100}}$",
    "To express the given expression as a common fraction, we can simplify each term separately. \n\nFor any term $\\left(1-\\frac1{n}\\right)$, we can rewrite it as $\\left(1-\\frac{n-1}{n}\\right)$. Simplifying this expression gives us $\\left(\\frac{n-(n-1)}{n}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)$.\n\nTherefore, every term in the given expression simplifies to $\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)$. However, we have a product of these terms, and the product will involve cancellation.\n\nFor example, take the product of the first two terms:\n$\\left(1-\\frac12\\right)\\cdot\\left(1-\\frac13\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nNotice that the denominator of the second term cancels with the numerator of the first term.\n\nIn general, each product of consecutive terms will result in a fraction with a denominator that is one less than the next denominator. The product of the first $99$ terms is:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\dotsm \\left(\\frac{98}{99}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\cancel{2}}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\cancel{2}}{\\cancel{3}}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\cancel{3}}{\\cancel{4}}\\right)\\dotsm\\left(\\frac{\\cancel{98}}{\\cancel{99}}\\right)$\n\nAfter cancelling, we are left with $\\left(\\frac{1}{99}\\right)$ for the product of the first $99$ terms.\n\nNow, consider the product of the entire sequence:\n$\\left(1-\\frac12\\right)\\cdot\\left(1-\\frac13\\right)\\cdot\\left(1-\\frac14\\right)\\dotsm\\left(1-\\frac1{100}\\right)$\nThis product simplifies as follows:\n$\\left(1-\\frac12\\right)\\cdot\\left(1-\\frac13\\right)\\cdot\\left(1-\\frac14\\right)\\dotsm\\left(1-\\frac1{100}\\right)$\n$=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\dotsm\\left(\\frac{99}{100}\\right)$\n$=\\left(\\frac{1}{99}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{99}{100}\\right)$\n$= \\boxed{\\frac{1}{100}}$\n\nTherefore, the product of the given sequence can be expressed as the common fraction $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{100}}$."
