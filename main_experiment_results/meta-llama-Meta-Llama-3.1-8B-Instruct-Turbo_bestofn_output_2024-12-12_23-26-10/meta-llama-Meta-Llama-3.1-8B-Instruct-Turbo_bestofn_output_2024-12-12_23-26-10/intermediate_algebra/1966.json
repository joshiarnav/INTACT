    "To find the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3,$ we need to express $a_2$ and $a_3$ in terms of $r,$ the common ratio of the geometric sequence.\n\nWe know that $a_1 = 1,$ and in a geometric sequence, the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. Let's call this ratio $r.$ Then:\n\n$a_2 = a_1r = (1)r = r$\n\n$a_3 = a_2r = rr = r^2$\n\nNow we can express $4a_2 + 5a_3$ in terms of $r:$\n\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2$\n\nTo find the smallest possible value of $4r + 5r^2,$ we need to complete the square:\n\n$4r + 5r^2 = 5(r^2 + \\frac{4}{5}r) = 5(r^2 + \\frac{4}{5}r + \\frac{4}{25}) - \\frac{4}{5}$\n\nNow, let's simplify and rewrite $4r + 5r^2$ in a form where the right-hand side is equal to a square of some sort. Knowing, the number before the $r^2$ term will serve as the squared number, we use the trick to see that the ideal number is exactly $4/4 = 1$. Since we want the ideal $r^2$ to be $+\\frac{4}{5}$ squared, ideal $r^2$ is enlarged by $\\frac{4}{25}$,  $\\frac{4}{25}$ must then be $1$ for this reasoning for this completion of square to have the lower terms squared in order to have the ideal perfect square $\\left (r +\\frac{2}{5}\\right) ^2$ - for perfect completion of the square. We can just fulfill this trick by adding $\\frac{1}{25}$ to both sides of the equation. We know that the lower terms ideally must be $\\frac{1}{25}$ so we are trying to make $4\\cdot( lower  new   r )^2$ and $5\\cdot new \\  square  $  $r^2$ to be $ new  r^ 2+lower   r^2$.\n\nBy $\\frac{4}{5} * 5 = \\frac{1}{5}4\\cdot( \\ lower\\ r)$ then this must equal $1\\cdot \\ new \\ r$ \n\nThus for-forcing $\\frac{4}{25}$ to be counted, we add $1 \\cdot new  r^2$ to both sides\n\nThe $\\left(1 + new \\cdot r^2\\right)$ ideally is $1 * 25 \\cdot  \\frac{1}{25}$ lower new $r^2$ so this $new  r ^2 \\ always$ cancels.  $ new\\  lower$ consisting of a multiplier form counted $1 \\cdot new  r^2$  alone alone cancels by elimination. We take-home $\\left (1  * r+\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2$ ideally so $1 \\cdot *r$ is only $new r$ (this counted as $ lower  *r$   new  by elimination).\n\nPlus $\\frac{4}{25}$ cancels ideal $\\frac{4}{25}$ for ideal new $r^2+\\frac{4}{5}r * 25. 5*\n\nThe ethic consisting in form-canceling lower, higher.\n\nSo $\\left(1 * r+\\frac{2}{5} \\right)^2 -\\frac{4}{5}$ would look like $5\\left(r^2+\\frac{4}{5}r\\right)-\\frac{4}{5}.$ (Five times square $r^2$.)Only half would be if $\\frac{2}{5} * 2  2  * number comes in numerator of $\\frac{2}{5}$ not in numerator alone it cancels by elimination. Only ideal $\\frac{2}{5}$ stays by cancellation. Only ideal $\\frac{2}{5}$ stays ideal. Only new ethic $\\frac{4}{5}$ cancels * 5.",
    "To find the smallest possible value of 4a2 + 5a3, we first need to find a relationship between a2 and a3 in terms of the common ratio r.\n\nGiven that a1 = 1, a2 = a1 * r = r, and a3 = a1 * r^2 = r^2.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for a2 and a3 into 4a2 + 5a3: 4a2 + 5a3 = 4r + 5r^2.\n\nTo find the minimum value of 4r + 5r^2, we can complete the square or use calculus. Using calculus is more straightforward in this case. \n\nWe take the derivative of 4r + 5r^2 with respect to r, which is 4 + 10r. Setting this equal to 0, we get 4 + 10r = 0. \n\nSolving for r, we get r = -4/10 = -2/5.\n\nTo ensure that this value of r is a minimum, we take the second derivative, which is 10. Since the second derivative is positive, r = -2/5 is indeed a minimum.\n\nNow, substitute the value r = -2/5 into the expression 4r + 5r^2 = 4(-2/5) + 5(-2/5)^2 = -8/5 + 20/25 = -8*5/25 + 4*5/25 = -40 + 20/25.\n\nTo simplify the last part further the 20 was not multiplied by 5 making this  -8/5 + 20/25  it would be: -8*5/25 + 20/25 = -40/25 + 20/25 = -20/25. This is equivalent to -4/5 when 20 divided by 25 is found to be 4 over 5 in lumped terms , then -8/5 is found reduced to be -4/5 then they can be found to be -4/5 - 4/5 = -8/5.\n\nHowever -8/5 simplification should not now be needed as it is obviously  -4/5 - 4/5 =-8/5",
    "To find the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3,$ we first need to understand what a geometric sequence is and how its terms are related.\n\nIn a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a constant called the common ratio ($r$). If $a_1$ is the first term, then the second term $a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r,$ and the third term $a_3 = a_2 \\cdot r = a_1 \\cdot r^2.$\n\nGiven that $a_1 = 1,$ we can find the general expressions for $a_2$ and $a_3$ in terms of $r:$\n$a_2 = 1 \\cdot r = r,$\n$a_3 = 1 \\cdot r^2 = r^2.$\n\nNow we can express $4a_2 + 5a_3$ in terms of $r:$\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2.$\n\nTo find the smallest possible value of $4r + 5r^2,$ we can rewrite it as a quadratic function: $f(r) = 5r^2 + 4r.$ We want to minimize this function.\n\nUsing calculus, we find the critical point by taking the derivative of $f(r)$ and setting it to zero:\n$f'(r) = 10r + 4.$\nSetting this equal to zero and solving for $r$, we get:\n$10r + 4 = 0 \\implies 10r = -4 \\implies r = -\\frac{2}{5}.$\n\nTo determine whether this critical point is a minimum, we can take the derivative again and test whether it's positive (meaning a minimum) or negative (meaning a maximum). If we calculate the second derivative:\n$f''(r) = 10,$ we can see it's always positive, which confirms that $r = -\\frac{2}{5}$ is indeed a minimum.\n\nSo we can calculate the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$ by substituting the value $r = -\\frac{2}{5}$ into the expression:\n$4r + 5r^2 = 4\\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right) + 5\\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{4}{5} = -\\frac{4}{5}.$\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}}.$"
