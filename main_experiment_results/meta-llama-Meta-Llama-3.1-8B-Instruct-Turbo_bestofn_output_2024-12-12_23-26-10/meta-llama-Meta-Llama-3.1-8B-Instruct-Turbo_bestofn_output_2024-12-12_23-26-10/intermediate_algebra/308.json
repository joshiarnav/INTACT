    "To find the set $S$ of all real numbers $x$ such that $f_n(x) = x$ for some positive integer $n$, we need to find the values of $x$ that satisfy $f_n(x) = x$ for $n \\ge 2.$\n\nFirst, let's consider the equation $f(x) = x,$ where $f(x) = \\frac{x + 6}{x}.$ Then, we have\n$\\frac{x + 6}{x} = x.$ Multiplying both sides by $x$ gives us\n$x + 6 = x^2,$ which is equivalent to $x^2 - x - 6 = 0.$ This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula. The roots are\n\\[x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4 \\cdot (-6)}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm 5}{2},\\]so the roots are $x = 3$ and $x = -2.$ These are the potential values of $x$ that satisfy $f(x) = x.$\n\nHowever, we want to find the values of $x$ such that $f_n(x) = x$ for some positive integer $n.$ In other words, we need to find the values of $x$ such that the sequence $(f_n)$ is eventually periodic, with period 1. That is, for some $N,$ we have\n\\[f_{N+k}(x) = f_N(x)\\]for all positive integers $k.$ Since $f(3) = 3$ and $f(-2) = -2,$ we have\n$f_2(3) = \\frac{7 \\cdot 3 + 6}{3 + 6} = \\frac{27}{9} = 3$ and $f_2(-2) = \\frac{7 \\cdot (-2) + 6}{-2 + 6} = \\frac{-14}{4} = -\\frac{7}{2}.$ However, we notice that $f(-\\frac{7}{2}) = -2.$ Then, we have $f(f(-\\frac{7}{2})) = f_2(-\\frac{7}{2}) \\not = -2$ which then implies $f_n(x) = f_n(y)$ doesn't mean the sequence is periodic with period one. On the other hand, since we let $f_2(-2) = -\\frac{7}{2}$  Therefore, since $f(-\\frac{7}{2}) = -2$ we find that $f_2(-2) = -f(-\\frac{7}{2}) = f_2(3)$. This then gives that the set $S$ = {3, -2}. Since the values of f(3) and f(-2) do not produce any loops when evaluated at themselves after being plugged into the function $f(x)$ only $x = 3$ and $x = -2$ work. Since there's no solution other than that two values the value of S must be $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "To solve this problem, let's start by assuming that $f_n(x) = x$ for some integer $n$.

    "To find the set $S$, we first need to understand what $f_n(x) = x$ means in terms of the function $f$. This equation indicates that when the function $f$ is applied $n$ times to the number $x$, the result is $x$. In other words, if we repeatedly apply the function $f$ to $x$, we will eventually get back to $x$ itself.\n\nLet's start by finding the fixed points of the function $f$, which are the values of $x$ such that $f(x) = x$. We have\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= x \\\\\n\\frac{x + 6}{x} &= x \\\\\nx + 6 &= x^2 \\\\\n0 &= x^2 - x - 6 \\\\\n0 &= (x - 3)(x + 2) \\\\\nx - 3 &= 0 \\;\\;\\; \\text{or} \\;\\;\\; x + 2 = 0 \\\\\nx &= 3 \\;\\;\\;\\; \\text{or} \\;\\;\\;\\; x = -2\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the fixed points of $f$ are $x = 3$ and $x = -2$.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we apply $f$ to these fixed points. Since $f(3) = 3$ and $f(-2) = -2$, both $3$ and $-2$ are also fixed points of $f_n$ for any positive integer $n$.\n\nNext, consider what happens if we apply $f$ to a value $x$ that is not a fixed point. Since $f$ is a rational function with a non-zero denominator, it preserves the sign of $x$. Therefore, if $x$ is positive, $f(x)$ is also positive. Similarly, if $x$ is negative, $f(x)$ is also negative.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we apply $f$ repeatedly to a value $x$ that is not a fixed point. We can write\n\\begin{align*}\nf_n(x) &= f(f_{n-1}(x)) \\\\\n&= f(x) \\;\\;\\; \\text{(since $f(x) = x$ is not true, $f_{n-1}(x) \\ne x$)} \\\\\n&= f(f(f_{n-2}(x))) \\\\\n&= \\vdots \\\\\n&= f(f(\\cdots f(x) \\cdots))\n\\end{align*}\nwhere we have applied the function $f$ to $x$ repeatedly $n$ times. Since $f(x) \\ne x$, we have $f_n(x) \\ne x$ for any $n > 1$.\n\nTo find the set $S$, we need to find the numbers $x$ such that $f_n(x) = x$ for some positive integer $n$. We have already shown that the fixed points of $f$, namely $x = 3$ and $x = -2$, are also fixed points of $f_n$ for any positive integer $n$. Therefore, the set $S$ consists of these two elements.\n\nIn conclusion, the set $S$ has $\\boxed{2}$ elements.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{2}$"
