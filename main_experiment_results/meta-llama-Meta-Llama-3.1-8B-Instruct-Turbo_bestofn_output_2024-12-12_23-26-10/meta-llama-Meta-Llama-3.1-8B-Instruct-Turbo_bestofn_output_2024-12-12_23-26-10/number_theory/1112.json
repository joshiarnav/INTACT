    "Let's solve this problem step by step.\n\nGiven the addition problem:\n\n$$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & 3 & 2 & 1 & \\triangle_6\\\\ & & & \\triangle & 4 & 0_6\\\\ &+ & & & \\triangle & 2_6\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & 4 & 2 & \\triangle & 1_6\\\\ \\end{array} $$\n\nSince this is a base $6$ addition, let's remember that: $0_6+0_6=0_6$, $1_6+0_6=1_6$, $2_6+0_6=2_6$, $3_6+0_6=3_6$, $4_6+0_6=4_6$, $5_6+0_6=5_6$.",
    "To determine the value of $\\triangle$, we should analyze the addition problem step by step. \n\nStarting from the rightmost column, we see that $\\triangle + 0 + 2$ results in $1_6$ with a carry of $1$. Since the maximum value in base $6$ is $5$, it's not possible for $\\triangle + 0 + 2$ to equal $1_6$ without a carry. Therefore, there must be a carry in this case, which means we need to consider the next number to the left (the $\\triangle$ in the second column).\n\nSince we know there's a carry in the rightmost column, we have $1_6$ as the carry, and we obtain $\\triangle + 0 + 2 = 11_6$, where $1_6$ is the carry.

In base 6, the result can't have a decimal, so we have $\\triangle + 0 + 2 = 11_6$ or $\\triangle+2_{10}=7_{10}$. As a result, the correct equation to solve for $\\triangle$ is $\\triangle+2=7_{10}$ or $\\triangle = 5_{10}$. Converting this back to base 6 (note: in base 6, 5 can be represented in base 6 (you need simply: 5 and not 11 or 9 as you would be in base 9, 10) gives us $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "Let's solve this step by step. \n\nFirst, let's look at the units column. We have $\\triangle + 0 + 2 = 1_6$. However, this means that $\\triangle + 2$ has a remainder of $1$ when divided by $6$. So, let's find the possible values for $\\triangle$ which will make this true.\n\n$\\triangle + 2 = 1 \\implies \\triangle = -1$\n\nHowever, since we're dealing with digits, it's not possible for $\\triangle$ to be $-1$.\n\n$\\triangle + 2 = 7 \\implies \\triangle = 5$\n\nNow let's move to the next column. We have $\\triangle + 4 + \\triangle = \\triangle_6$. Since we found that $\\triangle = 5$ in the previous step, we can plug this value in.\n\n$5 + 4 + 5 = 14_6$. However, in base 6, this should be $4$ in the $\\triangle$ column and a $2$ in the next column with a carry of $1$. Since we already have a $2$ in the next column, this works out.\n\nNow let's verify with the hundreds column. We have $1 + 0 + \\triangle = \\triangle_6$. Since we already have $\\triangle = 5$, this works out.\n\nNow let's move to the thousands column. We have $2 + \\triangle = \\triangle_6$. Again, since $\\triangle = 5$, this works out.\n\nFinally, let's move to the ten thousands column. We have $3 + 0 + \\triangle = 4_6$. Since we have a carry of $1$ from the previous column, this works out, as $3 + 0 + 5 + 1 = 9$, which is $13$ in the decimal system and so $3$ in base 6.\n\nSo, after verifying all the columns, we can confirm that $\\triangle = 5$. In the requested format, this is $\\boxed{5}$."
