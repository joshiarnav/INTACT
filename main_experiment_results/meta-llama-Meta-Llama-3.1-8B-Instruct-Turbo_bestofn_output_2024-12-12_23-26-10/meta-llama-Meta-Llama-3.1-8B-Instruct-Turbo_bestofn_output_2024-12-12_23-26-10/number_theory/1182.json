    "To find the residue of $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to simplify each term separately and then find the residue of the resulting expression.\n\n1. $182\\cdot 12$: Since 182 is a multiple of 14 (14 x 13 = 182), we can ignore it when finding the residue mod 14. The residue of 182 is 0 mod 14. So, $182\\cdot 12 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{14}$.\n\n2. $15\\cdot 7$: This term also needs to be considered in terms of residue. To do that, we can first find the residue of 15 mod 14. Since 15 is 1 more than a multiple of 14 (14 x 1 = 14, and 15 - 14 = 1), the residue of 15 mod 14 is 1.\n\nNow consider the expression (1 x 7). This will then have a residue of 7 when found $\\pmod{14}$. Thus, the residue of $15\\cdot 7\\pmod{14}$ is $7$.\n\n3. Now we have the expression: $0 - 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$. We just need to add the terms. \n\n$-7 + 3 = -4$. \n\nSince we're taking mod 14 of this number, we can add 14 to it until we get a positive number less than 14. \n\n$-4 + 14 = 10$",
    "To find the residue of $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$, we need to break down the expression step by step.\n\nStep 1: $182\\cdot 12\\pmod{14}$ \nFirst, let's simplify $182\\pmod{14}$ by dividing 182 by 14 and finding the remainder. \n182 / 14 = 13 remainder 0. \nSo, $182\\pmod{14}$ is equivalent to 0.\n\nNow, let's find $0\\cdot 12\\pmod{14}$, which is equivalent to 0.\n\nStep 2: $15\\cdot 7\\pmod{14}$ \nFirst, let's simplify $15\\pmod{14}$ by dividing 15 by 14 and finding the remainder. \n15 / 14 = 1 remainder 1. \nSo, $15\\pmod{14}$ is equivalent to 1.\n\nNow, let's find $1\\cdot 7\\pmod{14}$, which is equivalent to 7.\n\nStep 3: Combine the residues we found in steps 1 and 2. \nWe have $0\\cdot 12 - 7 + 3$. \n\nStep 4: Simplify $0\\cdot 12 - 7 + 3$. \nThe expression $0\\cdot 12$ is equivalent to 0. \nSo, the expression is equivalent to $0 - 7 + 3$.\n\nStep 5: Simplify $0 - 7 + 3$. \nThe expression is equivalent to $-4$.\n\nStep 6: Since we are working in $\\pmod{14}$, we need to find the residue of $-4$ modulo 14.\nWe can add 14 to $-4$ to make it positive, which results in 10.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{10}$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They all arrive at the same answer, which is 10.\n\nHowever, I would say that Solution 1 is the best.

  "solution": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7.
