    "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we can start by considering the hundreds digit, which should be as large as possible.\n\nThe largest possible hundreds digit is 9. If the hundreds digit is 9, the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9, as the number is divisible by 9. Therefore, the remaining two digits must sum to a multiple of 9.\n\nThe largest possible tens digit under this condition is 8, since 8 + 1 = 9, which is a multiple of 9. \n\nNext, we need to find a units digit that, when added to 8, gives a multiple of 9. This can be 1, as 8 + 1 = 9, which is a multiple of 9.\n\nSo, we now have 981 as our three-digit number. However, we need to ensure that each digit is distinct and non-zero. 981 has all distinct digits, but 0 is not non-zero.\n\nWe should consider 879 as a potential answer, and indeed 879 is divisible by 8, 7, and 9.",
    "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, let's consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Ending digit:** Since the number should be as large as possible, we'll consider numbers ending in 9. A larger ending digit gives us a higher starting number, as the rest of the digits will be smaller.\n\n2. **Divisibility rules:** A number divisible by 9 should also be divisible by the sum of its digits, as the sum of digits of a multiple of 9 will be a multiple of 9.\n\n3. **Rules of divisibility for 3:** For a three-digit number, it's divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n\n4. **Finding other non-zero digits:** If the number is divisible by 9, then the sum of its digits (which is the number itself plus the other non-zero digits) must be divisible by 9. We can use this to find the other digits.\n\n5. **Eliminate non-possibilities:** Given the conditions for divisibility, we need the remaining two digits (after choosing the digit 9) to be such that their sum divided by 9 is an integer and their product is a three-digit number.\n\nConsidering the divisibility by 9, a multiple of 9 is some number down by 9. Since the sum of the digits in the problem must be divisible by 9, there are some stages you can find while solving the problem.\n\nThe number 999 is divisible by 3 and 9, but the sum of the digits is 27, which is divisible by 9. However, it is not the only multiple of 9 that we can find. It might be necessary to use some of the stages you can find while solving the problem.\n\nHere are some multiples of 9 that consist of the first three digits that you can use while solving the problem.\n\n- 990 is divisible by 3 and some of its other digits, and it's part of the list that follows in stages while finding multiples of 9 that are stages of your problem.\n- 981 is also divisible and its digits also come as a combination of the list that follows the stages you need to find in the stages while solving the problem.\n\nFrom here on, and considering every multiple of 9, some of its other non-zero digits must be divided by 9, as the number needs to be divisible by its non-zero digits.\n\nFrom the list of multiples of 9 and the non-zero digits in its multiples stages you can see that the first multiple in the list that matches the problem is 990, some of the other non-zero digits of the list match the rule of divisible non-zero digits and the other non-zero digits in 981 matches that list, the mantis-like mantis also need some down-stages or in simpler words the multiple of 9 is smaller some of down-stages while solving the problem.\n\nDividing 990 and 981 by down-stages, we can get an accurate representation of the non-zero digits mantis stages in which some down-stages of the mantis and its non- multiple of 9 is some number down from 981 and the next stage after it, which is  and the last non down- stage is  which matches the digits in the number.\n\nLet's use the number 981 as an example of one of the multiples of 9 mantis stages:\n\n- 981 mantis stages need some down-stages after dividing 981, also known as some of its some of  down-stages while solving the problem.\n\nDividing 981 by  and the non down-stages after dividing 981 matches the rule for non- zero digits that must be divided by the number.\n\nMatching 981 stages non down-stages in the number show us that 999 does not some number down from 999 is part of the mantis, but  and the other non down-stages after dividing 981 and 999 are some number down from 981 and 999.\n\nTherefore, we need mantis stages non down mantis non-m mant mant non mant mant mant stages non-m down mant mant mant mant in the number show which is equal to the number.",
    "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we need to consider the properties of such a number. \n\n1. The number should be as large as possible, so we start with the largest possible hundreds digit, which is 9.\n\n2. Since the number should be divisible by each of its digits, and 9 is the largest digit, it cannot be divisible by 8 because a number divisible by 8 must end in either 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 and have a remainder of 0 when divided by 8. Hence, the number must be divisible by 8 to have any chance of divisible by any other digit and to ensure divisibility by any digit that can be 8 such as 9 + 9 - 0. \n\n3. The next largest hundred digits after 9 are 8 and we have concluded that it cannot be 0, hence the number must be divisible by 8 to ensure it meets that requirement which we can form by any number ending in 0 and that is to ensure the sum of 9 and and another digit greater than 0 and 9 and another and 8 will have 9 and another and and another and 8 divisible by 9 and divisible by 8 thus ensuring divisibility with digits such as 9 + 9 - 0 or such that 9 + 9 + 8 such that a number can be end up having number with certain 9+ and another and 9 + 9 + 8 with digit such that 9 + 9 such and

  "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",
