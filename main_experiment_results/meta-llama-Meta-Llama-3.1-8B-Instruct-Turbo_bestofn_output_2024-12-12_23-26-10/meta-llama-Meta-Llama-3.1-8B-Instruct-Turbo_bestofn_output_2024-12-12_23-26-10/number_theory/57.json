    "To solve this problem, we can use theChinese Remainder Theorem or simply apply modular arithmetic. However, since the numbers are confined to the same mod, we can also simply evaluate each of the remainders.\n\nWe're given that when the first integer is divided by $24$, the remainder is $10,$ \nwhen the second integer is divided by $24$, the remainder is $4,$\nand when the third integer is divided by $24$, the remainder is $12.$\n\nNow we need to evaluate what happens when we sum these integers.\n\nThe first integer is equivalent to $10$ mod $24$, \nthe second is $4$ mod $24$, \nand the third is $12$ mod $24$.\n\nWe can first add the remainders:\n\n$10 + 4 + 12 = 26$\n\nSince we're working mod $24$, we need to evaluate $26$ mod $24$. \n\nTo do this, we find the difference between $26$ and the modulus, $24$:\n\n$26 - 24 = 2$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the integers is equivalent to $2$ mod $24$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "To find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, let's represent the three integers as $24a + 10,$ $24b + 4,$ and $24c + 12$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers.\n\n2. The sum of these three integers can be expressed as $(24a + 10) + (24b + 4) + (24c + 12)$.\n\n3. Simplifying the expression, we get $24a + 24b + 24c + 10 + 4 + 12 = 24(a+b+c) + 26$.\n\n4. Noticing that $24(a+b+c)$ is a multiple of 24 (since it's a multiple of 24), we can rewrite it as $24(a+b+c) + 0$.\n\n5. So, the sum of the three integers can be further simplified to $24(a+b+c) + 26 = 24(a+b+c) + 24 + 2 = 24(a+b+c+1) + 2$.\n\n6.
