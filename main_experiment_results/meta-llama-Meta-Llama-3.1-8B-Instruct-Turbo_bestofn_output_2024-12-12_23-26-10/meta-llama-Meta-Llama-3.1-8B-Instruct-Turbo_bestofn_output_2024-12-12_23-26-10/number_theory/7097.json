    "To find the least possible value of $m+n$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we know that $210=2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. Given that $\\gcd(m+n,210)=1$, this means $m+n$ is not a multiple of $2$, $3$, $5$, or $7$.\n\n2. From condition $\\bullet\\ m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n,$ we can take logarithms to the base $n$. It implies that\n\\[m\\log m\\ge \\log n+\\log n^{\\log m / \\log n} = 2 \\log n+\\log_nm,\\]\nso \n\\[m\\ge 2^{1/\\log_nm}.\\]\nSince $2^{1/\\log_nm}\\ge n^{1/\\log n}$ by AM-GM inequality, we get $m\\ge n^{1/\\log n}\\sqrt n$ for $n>1$.\nHowever, since we require a positive $m$ such that $m\\ge n^{1/\\log n}\\sqrt n$, we see that some value other than 1 needs to be assigned to n at some point where $n^{1/\\log n}\\sqrt n$ reaches into a positive integer value.\n3. The only remaining value is $n=1$ where the value of n gets valid and sensible to proceed with our problem requirements.\n\n4. From $m+n$ should not be divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7 in order to be able to set some specific form for m + n values we will start evaluating such possibilities that could result in m+n  with low or least form.\nThe pair (m, n) = (7, 3) keeps gcd(m + n, 210) = 1\nSimilarly given m*m should be multiple of n*n, applying such 7 and 3 pair into this specific case is working.\n\nHence m = n^2 as we need to keep m not equal to multiple of n so m could be 9. \n\nNow we have to make sure n*m should be at least \\sqrt n*n. Given value 9 for m, n=\\sqrt n *n when keep m not equal to multiple of n, value of 3 seem good n*3=9 which satisfies all our steps.\n\n5. Hence the least possible value of m + n = 7 + 9 = \\boxed{16}.",
    "To find the least possible value of $m + n$, we need to follow the conditions given in the problem.\n\nFrom the first condition, $\\gcd(m+n,210)=1,$ we know that the greatest common divisor of $m + n$ and $210$ is $1$. This means that the sum of $m$ and $n$ has no common factors with $210$ other than $1$.\n\nNow, from the second condition, $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n,$ it means $m^m$ is divisible by $n^n$. Since $n$ is a factor of $m^m$, we can say that $n \\leq m$. If $m$ and $n$ were equal, it would contradict the third condition, which states that $m$ is not a multiple of $n$. Therefore, we have $n < m$.\n\nSince we need the smallest possible value of $m + n$, we will consider the smallest possible values of $n$ and $m$ while keeping the given conditions in mind.\n\nThe prime factorization of $210$ is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. This implies that the sum $m + n$ is not divisible by any of these prime factors. In other words, $m + n$ cannot be a multiple of $2, 3, 5,$ or $7$. We also know that $n < m$ and that $n \\leq m$.\n\nWe can also reason that one of these primes can be in $n$ as $n$ can't exceed the factors of $210$ to be the least; this prime factor needs to be to the power of the same as $m$. So, considering the lowest of these, let us assume $n=9$ (factor of $210$) so that we minimize the possibility of having any common factors with $210$. \n\nSince we need to pick the next multiple of the same prime factor, the next is $27$. Now, we are going to find an $m$ such that we get the $m$ value that will indeed satisfy the second condition of $m^m$ being the multiple of $n^n$.\n\nHere, for $n=9$ and $n^n = 9^9$, we are required to have $m=3 \\cdot p$ where $p$ is any prime number, and $p$ is multiplied by $3$. $m$ we can get we should end the multiple of $n$. Our first try is for $n^n = 3*3*3*9 = 243= 3^5$ , where $m=3*3$. \n\nSince we need to consider multiples of the least factor issued from $210$. In further search we looked at the next prime factor; this would either be 5 or 7; and also a multiple of 9 would have a value of 3 cubed which shows the importance of using the cubed number ($9$) because $9$ is a multiple of the first mentioned prime numbers.\n\nNow in our first two approaches of going forward by selecting next nearest prime factor sets to multiply and create for next

    "To find the least possible value of $m + n,$ let's break down the given conditions and solve them step by step.\n\n**Condition 1:** $\\gcd(m + n, 210) = 1$\n\nSince $210 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7,$ this means that $m + n$ cannot have any factors of 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n**Condition 2:** $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$\n\nThis condition implies that $n$ must divide $m^m/m,$ which is equivalent to $m^{m-1}.$ In other words, $m^{m-1}$ must have at least one factor of $n$.\n\n**Condition 3:** $m$ is not a multiple of $n$\n\nThis condition means that $m$ and $n$ share no common factors other than 1.\n\nNow, let's think of a possible value for $n$ that satisfies the above conditions.\n\nWe know that if $n$ has any factors of 2, 3, 5, or 7, then $m + n$ won't satisfy Condition 1. To avoid this, let's choose $n$ to be the product of prime numbers other than 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\nOne possible choice is $n = 11^2 = 121.$ However, $11^3 = 1331$ does not divide $m^{m-1}.$ This is because $1331$ has a prime factor of 11, which is not present in $m^{m-1}.$\n\nHowever, if $n = 11^3 = 1331,$ we can take $m = 10 \\cdot 1331$ (However, this makes $m+n$ divisible by $2$, failing condition 1).\n\nHowever, let's take $m = 11^2(10 + 1) = 1331 \\cdot 11 = 14641.$\n\nThis doesn't fail condition 2 as $\\frac{m^{m-1}}{n} = (11)^{10 \\cdot 159} \\cdot 10^159 \\cdot 11^159 $ is divisible by $n = 1331$ ($n$ is the $3rd$ power of $11$).\nThis still won't fail condition 3, as there are no common $11$'s. When $11^3$ is used, it makes $n^n$ have a factor of $11$ which is still non present $m^m$. \n\nHowever, still, $m + n$ won't satisfy Condition 1, because $n=11^3$ has a factor of $11,$ which is still present in $m+n$. A smaller value of $n$ that still satisfies this condition is needed.\n\nLet's consider $n = 11$ and $m = 11k,$ where $k > 1.$ However, this would make $m$ a multiple of $n,$ violating Condition 3.\n\nHowever, we can take $n = 159$ and $m = 11 \\cdot 159.$ This $m$ does not have a factor of $11,$ so it still does not fail condition 3.\n\nLet's verify if it satisfies condition 1:\n\nWe know that $m + n = 11 \\cdot 159 + 159 = 11 \\cdot159 + 11^2 $.\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n $m + n = 11^2 (10 + 1) + 11^2 =  11^2 \\cdot (11 + 10)$\n\nHowever, this does not satisfy condition 1 as it is still divisible by 11.\n\nWe can see that conditions 2 and 3 are satisfied here. The pair is  $(m,n) = ( 11 \\cdot 159,  159).$\n\nNow, to satisfy the first condition, let's consider $n = 10,$ as this would make $\\gcd(m + n, 210) = 1.$\n\nIf $n=10,$ we have $m^m$ still a multiple of $10^{10}$. We then take $m = 159 \\cdot 10.$\n\nHowever, $n = 10$ ($n$ has a factor of 2), leads to $n$ being divisible by $2.$ $2$ still present in $m+n$. When $2$ is still present $n=10$ makes $m + n$ still have a factor of $2.$ $\\gcd(m + n,210) \\n\u529e= 1,$ $210=2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7.$\n\nTo satisfy the first condition, let's consider $n = 209.$ $n$ does not have any factors of 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\nIf $n = 209,$ then $m^m$ must have at least one factor of $209.$ We can see that $23^{209} \\vert m^{m-1}.$ Hence, $159 \\vert m.$\n\nThus, we have $n = 209$ and $m = 23 \\cdot 209,$ which satisfies all three conditions. \n\nHowever, we can minimize the value. If we take $m = 19 \\cdot 209,$ we still satisfy condition 3.\n\n $m + n =  19 \\cdot 209 + 209 =  19 \\cdot 209 +  19 \\cdot 11 = 19^2 \\cdot (10 + 11)$\n\nThis is still divisible by 19.\n\nNow, $19 \\vert 209 $ to see if it will satisfy condition 1.\n\nCondition 1 is not satisfied for this value of $m$ and $n$."

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I can see that Solution 3 is the most correct and straightforward solution to the problem. It follows a clear and step-by-step approach to finding the least possible value of $m + n$ that satisfies all the given conditions.\n\nSolution 1 has some minor errors and unclear explanations, but the main idea is correct. Solution 2 is a bit confusing and has many irrelevant sentences, but it also has some good points.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend Solution 3 as the best solution.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 3",
  "solution": "Taking inspiration from $4^4 \\mid 10^{10}$ we are inspired to take $n$ to be $p^2$, the lowest prime not dividing $210$, or $11 \\implies n = 121$. Now, there are $242$ factors of $11$, so $11^{242} \\mid m^m$, and then $m = 11k$ for $k \\geq 22$. Now, $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = \\gcd(11+k,210) = 1$. Noting $k = 26$ is the minimal that satisfies this, we get $(n,m) = (121,286)$. Thus, it is easy to verify this is minimal and we get $\\boxed{407}$.",
