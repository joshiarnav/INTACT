    "To find the clever integers, we need to consider even numbers between 20 and 120 (exclusive) and the sum of their digits should be 9.\n\nWe start from 20, and the first number that has a digit sum of 9 is 27. However, 27 is not divisible by 2, and hence, not a clever integer. The next number after 27 is 36. 36 has digits totaling 9, and it is a clever integer because it is even and greater than 20.\n\nNow let's list out clever integers where the sum of their digits equals 9. \n\nThe numbers with digit sum 9 that we can list from 20 to 120 are 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, and 117. We will exclude 27, 45, 63, 81, 117 because they're not even. After the exclusion, the lists are left 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108 for further filtration.\n\nOut of the remaining numbers, the ones that are divisible by 27 are 54 and 108.\n\nThere are 5 clever integers in total, and 2 of them are divisible by 27.\n\nThe fraction is calculated by taking the number of clever integers divisible by 27 and dividing it by the total number of clever integers. So, $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$ is the answer.",
    "We need to find the range of the integers, which is between 20 and 120. First, let's narrow down our number to be multiples of 2 but only for the tens place (if the number were odd, the clever number wouldn't be multiple of 2) and the ones place could be of any number from 0 to 9 because the sum of the number must be 9, sum of two digits must be = 9, like 0+9, 1+8 or 2+7 and so on.\n\nWe are restricted to even numbers, meaning that the ones digit is even. So the ones digit can be 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8.\n\nLet's calculate all the clever numbers in the given range. Since we are restricted to the tens place to be a multiple of 2 to make the entire number a multiple of 2, it can be 2, 4, 6, 8.\n\nSo possible numbers are (2+0 or sum of two numbers to get 9) = 20 (less than 20), (4+5 = 9 sum not possible here because 4 + 5 =14 which isn't 9),  (6+3 = 9), (8+1 = 9), (0+9 = 9). But the number should be multiple of 2 so we have only three possible solution (6+3), (8+1) and (0+9). So the possible numbers are 63, 81, 90.\n\nSince 90 is not a multiple of 27. We have only two numbers, 63 and 81 which are both multiples of 27.\n\nNow there are 3 clever numbers in the given range and only 2 of which are multiples of 27. Therefore the fraction of all clever integers that is divisible by 27 is $\\boxed{2/3}$.",
    "To find the fraction of all clever integers that are divisible by 27, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find all clever integers**: A clever integer must be an even integer greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9.\n\n   - First, list all possible integers in this range: \n     22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119\n\n   - Then, we'll exclude integers with a digit sum greater than 9. Now we only have ranges where either any single-digit will remain, or if any two digits sum to 9: i.e. 1+8, 2+7, 3+6, 4+5 and any two-digit combinations: 19, 28, 37, 46, 55, 64, 73, 82, 91. There are only 3 remaining possibilities where the two-digit number is even as per our criteria:\n     - 27 is odd, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99 remain, 28 is even thus is valid, 37 is odd thus is not valid, 46 is even thus is valid and 55 is odd thus is not valid, thus 64 is even thus is valid, 73 is odd thus is not valid, 82 is even thus is valid, 91 is odd thus is not valid. The two-digit possibilities 19 remains, 28 is valid, 46 is valid, 64 is valid, 82 is valid\n\n   - Another condition is that it must be greater than 20, less than 120 so all the valid numbers which sum up to digits of 9 and are even will be:\n     - 36, 46, 64, 82, 28\n\n   - Hence there are 5 clever integers.\n\n2.  **Determine which clever integers are divisible by 27**: \n\n   - 27 is divisible by 27 and 36 is divisible by 27. Thus we have 2 clever integers that are divisible by 27.\n\n3.  **Express the fraction of clever integers divisible by 27**:\n\n   - The number of clever integers divisible by 27 is 2. \n   - The total number of clever integers is 5.\n\n   - The fraction is (2/5).\n\nThus, the fraction of all clever integers that are divisible by 27 is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$."
