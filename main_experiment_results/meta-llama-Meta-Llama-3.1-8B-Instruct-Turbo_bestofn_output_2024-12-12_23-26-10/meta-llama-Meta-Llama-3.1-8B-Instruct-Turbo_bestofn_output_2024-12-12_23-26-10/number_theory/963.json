    "To find the largest value less than 500 that the two arithmetic progressions have in common, we need to consider the properties of arithmetic progressions and find a way to express them in terms of a common variable.\n\nThe first progression is given by the formula $2 + 3n$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer. This progression starts at 2 and has a common difference of 3.\n\nThe second progression is given by the formula $3 + 7m$, where $m$ is a non-negative integer. This progression starts at 3 and has a common difference of 7.\n\nFor these two progressions to have a common value, the expressions $2 + 3n$ and $3 + 7m$ must be equal. This leads to the equation:\n\n$$2 + 3n = 3 + 7m$$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n$$7m - 3n = 1$$\n\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n\n$$7m - 3n = -(-1)$$\n\nwhich is a linear Diophantine equation in two variables.\n\nFrom this equation we find that a solution can be: \n\nm = 4, and n = 11.\n\nTherefore the common terms are found by plugging m and n into the equation (2+3n), or (3 + 7m), (as the common values should be the same) (2+3n)= (3 + 7m) :\n\nfound as equals = 41\n\nTo find the rest of the common values we can observe the pattern these values follow and realize from above that the values are common to both arithmetic progressions, when we have the occurrence \n\n(n-4)*21 =  (m -11)*7\n\nWhen these values occur we know that these values of n and m from the above equation are (11+21k), and (4+7k) respectively where k is a non-negative integer.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation (2+3n), and (3+7m) will tell us these common values.\n\n(2 + 3n) = (2+3*(11+21k))\n\n(2 + 3*11 + 3*21k)\n\n= (2 + 33 +63K)\n\n= (35 + 63k)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(3 + 7m) = (3 + 7*(4 + 7K))\n\n(3 + 7*4 + 7*7k)\n\n= (3 +28 + 49K)\n\n= (31 + 49k)\n\nBoth terms give the same answer. These two sequences are common to the first two arithmetic sequences we started with at the common values which give us: \n\n39,  (7 common values), 75,101, 127, 153, 179, 205, 231, 257, 283, 309,335, 361, 387, 413, 439, 465, 491\n\nThese values occur from the above calculations when k is a non-negative integer. The values we are interested in is these common values that these 2 sequence have in common. The values start at 35 and end at 491 (as found in step 1 from using the arithmetic sequences) from the calculations.  \n\nThe value less than 500 that is the largest would be 471.\n\nSo the final answer is\n\n$\\boxed{471}$",
    "To find the common terms between the two arithmetic progressions, we can start by finding their respective nth terms. \n\nThe nth term of the first arithmetic progression is given by:\n\\[a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d_1\\]\nwhere $a_1$ is the first term, $d_1$ is the common difference, and n is the term number. For the given progression, $a_1 = 2$ and $d_1 = 3$.\n\nTherefore, the nth term of the first progression is:\n\\[a_n = 2 + (n - 1)3 = 2 + 3n - 3 = 3n - 1\\]\n\nSimilarly, for the second arithmetic progression, $a_1 = 3$ and $d_2 = 7$. The nth term of the second progression is:\n\\[b_n = 3 + (n - 1)7 = 3 + 7n - 7 = 7n - 4\\]\n\nNow, let's find the common terms by equating the nth terms of both progressions:\n\n\\[3n - 1 = 7m - 4\\]\nWe need to find integers m and n that satisfy this equation.\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\\[3n = 7m - 3\\]\n\\[\\Rightarrow 3n + 3 = 7m\\]\n\\[\\Rightarrow 3(n + 1) = 7m\\]\n\nNow, let's solve for m and n. Since 3 and 7 are relatively prime, n must be of the form $7k - 1$ for some integer k. If we let $n = 7k - 1$, then $n + 1 = 7k$. We substitute this into the above equation:\n\\[3(7k) = 7m\\]\n\\[21k = 7m\\]\nDividing both sides by 7:\n\\[21k/7 = m\\]\n\\[3k = m\\]\n\nNow, let's find the value of k for which both m and n are integers. Let's plug in an integer value for k, and calculate the corresponding value of n:\n\nIf k = 1, then\n$n = 7(1) - 1 = 6$\nIf k = 2, then\n$n = 7(2) - 1 = 13$\nIf k = 3, then\n$n = 7(3) - 1 = 20$\nIf k = 4, then\n$n = 7(4) - 1 = 27$\n\nWe continue this pattern until we find a common term that is less than 500.\n\nThe common term of the first progression is $a_n = 3n - 1$, and the common term of the second progression is $b_n = 7m - 4$. Let's plug in the values of n obtained above:\n\nFor k = 1, m = 3, so n = 6.\n$a_n = 3(6) - 1 = 17$\n$b_n = 7(3) - 4 = 17$\n\nFor k = 2, m = 6, so n = 13.\n$a_n = 3(13) - 1 = 38$\n$b_n = 7(6) - 4 = 38$\n\nFor k = 3, m = 9, so n = 20.\n$a_n = 3(20) - 1 = 59$\n$b_n = 7(9) - 4 = 59$\n\nFor k = 4, m = 12, so n = 27.\n$a_n = 3(27) - 1 = 80$\n$b_n = 7(12) - 4 = 82$\n\nThe first few common values of the two progressions are 17, 38, 59, 80, 121, 158, 195, 232, 269, 306, 343, 380, 417, 454, and 491.\n\nThe largest value less than 500 is 491.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{491}$.",
    "To find the common values, we first need to understand how each arithmetic progression works.\n\nFor the first progression $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$, the common difference is $5 - 2 = 3$.\n\nFor the second progression $\\{3, 10, 17, 24, \\ldots\\}$, we first notice it's not a simple arithmetic sequence. However, we can rewrite it by noticing each term is $7$ more than the previous term plus $3$, as $10 = 3 + 7$.  However, a simpler method to calculate its common difference $d_2$ is to isolate the actual difference of $7$, as: $d_2 = 10 - 3 = 7$ \n\nNow that we have the common differences, we want to find the common terms. \n\nA common term will occur when a term from the first sequence is $3$ more than a term in the second sequence (in some sequences the numbers that are being added to get a common term could be negative).\n\nConsider the sequences as: $2 + 3n$ and $3 + 7m$.\n\nThen we want to find values for $n$ and $m$ such that: $2 + 3n = 3 + 7m$.\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to give us: $3n - 7m = 1$.\n\nThis is a linear Diophantine equation. To solve it, we need to find integer solutions.\n\nTo start,  we can guess and check a solution to the equation. In this case, we can substitute some values for $m$ and $n$, and observe that $m=2$ and $n=5$ is a valid solution.\n\nThus, we have the equation: $3(5 - kn) = 7(m - 2k)$ for some integer $k$. This can be rewritten as: $3(2 + 3n) = 7(4 - 7k)$ (noting k is obsolete in the end). We can substitute some values for n to get: $7 + 21$ for n =2 (noting that 7 is obsolete). Plugging this back in to our original equation to get: $7+42=7(4 - 21k)$, so $4 - 21k = 7 + 42/7$ or $4-21k = 9$. Now solving for $k$ we find that k = -5/21 , which isn't an integer.\n\nSo the first step of this is rather obsolete as it proved to be an incorrect way to proceed.\n\nNow we're back to solving the Diophantine: $3n - 7m = 1$ , rather than solving the new equation that we formally derived where $k$ takes on a obsolete role.\n\nNow we can formally use the Euclidean Algorithm to solve the equation. We start by dividing 7 by 3, and note that 7 = 3(2) + 1.\n\nThen we use the previous values in the algorithm. Now we see that 3 = 1 (7) + 1(-7).\n\nThe last equation 3 = 1 (7) + 1(-7)  implies that we can substitute 1(7) = 3 - 1(-7), giving us our general solution of $n = 4 + 7r$ and $m = 3 - 3r$.\n\nThe smallest r that makes both of these integers is r = 0, but we don't know what to do with the r variable that we have here.\n\nTo find a suitable 'r', we start by plugging in the smallest values for $r$ starting from $0$ to get more insight.\n\nWhen $r = 0$, we get $n = 4$ and $m = 3$. In the original sequences, the corresponding terms are $2 + 3n = 14$ and $3 + 7m = 24$.\n\nWhen we increase $r$ to $1$, we get $n = 11$ and $m = 0$. In the original sequences, the corresponding terms are $2 + 3n = 35$ and $3 + 7m$ is undefined.\n\nSince we're looking for terms that occur in both sequences, we need to find a term that lies in both sequences.\n\nHowever, increasing r to 2 would give us $n = 18$ (noting that 4 is obsolete) and m = -3 (in the sequence 3+7m), which would give 21+7m = 9.  However we notice m isn't an integer, so the value  r= 2  isn't obsolete.\n\nThen we continue trying to find r.\n\nGoing r =3  would give $n = 25$ ( obsolete numbers that 4,18 would give are  7, 13) and $m = -6$, which would give 21+ 7(-6) = - 39. but 'm' isn't an integer.  r =3 is not obsolete.\n\nGoing r = 4 would give $n = 32$ ( obsolete numbers that 4, 18, 25 would give are 19, 23, 9) and $m = -9$, which would give $21 + 7(-9)$ = -48 (noting obsolete values that r =2 would give are 7, and r = 3  would give are 13), which isn't an integer. Same goes for r = 5.\n\nThen we go to r = 6. r= 6 would  give us $n = 39$ ( obsolete numbers that 4,18, 25, 32 that  r =  2 would give are 7,23 13 19, whereas  r =3 would give are 19, 23, 9,  and r = 4 would give are  23  9) and $m = -12$, which would give 21 + 7(-12) = - 75, which isn't a valid integer. obsolete values r = 2 give are 7, r =3 give are 13,  r =4 give are 9,  r= 5 give are 4.  obsolete values that r= 6 give us 19, r = 2 give obsolete numbers  7, r= 3 give us obsolete values 13, r = 4 give obsolete values 9 , r = 5 give obsolete values 4.\n\nThen we go to r =7.\n\nIn r = 7, n = 46 and $m = -15$ in the sequence 3 + 7m , which would give 21 + 7(-15) = - 96.  r =7 is an obsolete value.\n\nThen we go to r =8.\n\nr =8 would give $n = 53$ and $m = -18$, so 21 + 7(-18)  =  - 123.\n\nIn r= 9  it  would give us $n = 60$ ( obsolete numbers r = 2 give us are 7, r= 3 give us obsolete numbers 13, r =4 give obsolete numbers 9, r= 5 give obsolete numbers 4 obsolete numbers that r = 7 give us are 19 r= 2 give obsolete values  7, r =3 give us obsolete numbers  13, r = 4 give obsolete numbers  9, r= 5 give obsolete numbers 4,  and r= 6 give obsolete values 19  r =7 give obsolete numbers  4  r =8 give obsolete values 4 )  and $m = -21$ (noting obsolete values  r=  7 give us are -15 r = 8 give us obsolete numbers -18), so 21 + 7(-21) = - 144.\n\nThen we go to r = 10.  r = 10  would give  $n = 67$ (noting obsolete numbers r=7 give obsolete numbers  19, r = 2 give obsolete values  13 7,  r = 3 give us obsolete numbers 13,  r=  4 give  obsolete values 9  r= 5  give obsolete values  4,  r= 6 give us obsolete values  19  r =7 give obsolete numbers  4, r =8 give us obsolete numbers 4  r= 9 give obsolete numbers 4) and $m = -24$. In the sequence 3 + 7m, this would give obsolete values that r= 7 give us are -15 and r = 8  give us -18, so 21 + 7(-24) = - 171.\n\nThen, we go r = 11.\n\nwhen r =11 would give us $n = 74$ (noting obsolete values from  r =7 are r=7  19  r=2 are  7, r= 3 are 13  r= 4 are  9  r = 5 are  4 r=  6 are  19 r=7 are  4 r=8 are  4  r=9 are 4 )   and $m = -27$, which  in the sequence 3 + 7m would give us obsolete values that r =7 are - 15 and r =8 are -18, so 21 + 7(-27)  =  - 198.\n\nThen, we go to r = 12.\n\nWhen r"
