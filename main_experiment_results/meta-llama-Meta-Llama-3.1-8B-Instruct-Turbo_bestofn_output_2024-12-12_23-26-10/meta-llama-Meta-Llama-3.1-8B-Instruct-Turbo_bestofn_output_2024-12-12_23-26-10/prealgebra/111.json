    "To find the value of $(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5$, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, let's solve the expression inside the parentheses: $(6 + 1 - 4)$.\n\nInside the parentheses we have: \n- Start from the left: 6 + 1 = 7\n- Now the expression is: 7 - 4 = 3\n\n2. We now have $(21 \\div 3) \\cdot 5$.\n\n3. Next, let's solve the division: $21 \\div 3$.\n\n$21$ divided by $3$ gives us: $7$.\n\n4. We now have $(7) \\cdot 5$.\n\n5. Finally, let's multiply: $7 \\cdot 5 = 35$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{35}$.",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They all follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) and arrive at the same final answer: 35. However, Solution 1 and Solution 2 are more concise and clear in their explanations. \n\nSolution 3 initially had a mistake in step 3 where it incorrectly rewrote the equation as $7 \\div 3 \\cdot 5$. The correct step should be $7 \\cdot 5 = 35$.\n\nConsidering the clarity and accuracy of the solutions, the best solution is Solution 1.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "Recall that expressions within parentheses should be done first. In the inner set of parentheses, we have $6+1-4=3.$ So, the outer set of parentheses can be rewritten as $21\\div3=7.$ Finally, \\[(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5=7\\cdot5=\\boxed{35}.\\]",
