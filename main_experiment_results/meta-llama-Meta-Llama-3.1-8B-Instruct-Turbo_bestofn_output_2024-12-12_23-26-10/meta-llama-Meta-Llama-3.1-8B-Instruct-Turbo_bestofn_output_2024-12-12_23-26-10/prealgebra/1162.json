  "problem": "Chloe wants to buy a hoodie that costs $\\$32.75$. She empties her wallet and finds she only has three $\\$10$ bills, eight quarters, and a pile of dimes. What is the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie?",

    "To find the minimum number of dimes Chloe needs, we first need to find out how much money she has without the dimes. \n\nChloe has three $10 bills, which is 3 x $10 = $30.\nShe has eight quarters, which is 8 x $0.25 = $2.\nTotal money without dimes is $30 + $2 = $32.\n\nChloe needs to pay for a $\\$32.75$ hoodie. To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the money she already has from the price of the hoodie: $\\$32.75 - \\$32 = \\$0.75$.\n\nEach dime is worth $0.1. To find the minimum number of dimes she needs, we divide the remaining money by the value of one dime: $\\$0.75 \\div $0.1 = 7.5$. But since we can't have half a dime, we need to round up to the next whole number.\n\nSo, Chloe needs 8 dimes to have at least $\\$0.75$ more and pay for the hoodie.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile is $\\boxed{8}$.",

    "Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Chloe has 3 $\\$10$ bills, which equals $3 \\times \\$10 = \\$30.$ This leaves her with a remaining amount of $\\$32.75 - \\$30 = \\$2.75$ to pay.\n\nShe also has 8 quarters, which equals $8 \\times 0.25 = \\$2.00$.\n\nThe remaining amount she needs to pay after using the 3 $\\$10$ bills and the 8 quarters is $\\$2.75 - \\$2.00 = \\$0.75$.\n\nSince 75 cents is equivalent to 3 quarters, Chloe already has enough quarters to cover 75 cents of the remaining cost.\n\nTo find the minimum number of dimes she needs, we can divide $\\$0.75 / 0.10$ because 1 dime is equal to 10 cents.\n\nSo, $\\frac{\\$0.75}{\\$0.10} = 7.5$. Since you cannot have half a dime, Chloe needs to have at least 8 dimes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile is $\\boxed{8}.$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They arrive at the same conclusion, which is that Chloe needs 8 dimes to pay for the hoodie.\n\nHowever, Solution 1 is the most straightforward and easiest to follow. It clearly breaks down the problem into steps and provides a logical explanation for each step. Therefore, the best solution is Solution 1.\n\nSo, the index of the best solution is: 1",
