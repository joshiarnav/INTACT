    "To find the 20th digit after the decimal point of the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ to their decimal equivalents.\n\nFor $\\frac{1}{7}$, the decimal expansion is a repeating decimal, which can be calculated using long division. \n\n$\\frac{1}{7} = 0.\\overline{142857}$.\n\nHere, the repeating block is 142857.\n\nFor $\\frac{1}{3}$, the decimal expansion is also a repeating decimal, which can be calculated using long division.\n\n$\\frac{1}{3} = 0.\\overline{3}$.\n\nHere, the repeating block is 3.\n\n2. Find the sum of the decimal equivalents.\n\nNow, we add the decimal expansions of $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n$0.\\overline{142857} + 0.\\overline{3} = 0.\\overline{476190} + 0.\\overline{3} = 0.\\overline{4761903}$\n\nHowever, we need to correct the addition we did above since $0.\\overline{476190} + 0.\\overline{3} = 0.\\overline{476190} + 0.\\overline{333333}$. Thus it becomes \n\n$0.\\overline{476190} + 0.\\overline{333333} = 0.\\overline{809523}$\n\n3. Find the 20th digit after the decimal point.\n\nHere, the repeating block of the decimal expansion $0.\\overline{809523}$ is 809523. Since the length of the repeating block is 6, we can find the 20th digit after the decimal point as follows:\n\nThe 20th digit is the same as the 2nd digit because the remainder of 20/6 is 2. The 2nd digit in 809523 is 0.\n\nTherefore, the 20th digit after the decimal point of the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ is 0.",
    "To find the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, we need to first convert them into decimals.\n\nThe decimal equivalent of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$ (a repeating decimal).\n\nThe decimal equivalent of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $0.\\overline{3}$ (a repeating decimal).\n\nNow, let's sum the repeating decimals:\n\n$0.\\overline{142857} + 0.\\overline{3} = 0.\\overline{476190}.$ \n\nWe can see that the 20th digit after the repeating block is '0' + the repeating block, since every number ending in '7' repeating is followed by a '6', followed by a '7', followed by a '4'. The last digit of the repeating block is 7, and all the other digits are known from this repeating pattern every six digits which are 142857; which is 476190.  To find the 20th digit, let's see where the 20th digit is located. \n\nWe can divide 20 by 6 and see the remainder. 20 \u00f7 6 = 3 with a remainder of 2. This means that we have completed 3 full cycles of the repeating block, and we need to look at the 2nd digit of the repeating block. \n\nSince the repeating block is 476190, the 2nd digit is 7.\n\nSo, the 20th digit after the decimal point of the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ is 7.\n\n$\\boxed{7}$",
    "To solve the problem, we need to convert the fractions to their decimal equivalents.\n\n$\\frac{1}{7}$ can be converted by long division: \n   0.142857142857...\n   This pattern repeats after 6 digits.\n\n$\\frac{1}{3}$ can be converted as:\n   0.333333333333...\n   This pattern repeats after 1 digit.\n\nNow, let's add the decimals:\n   $\\frac{1}{7}$ + $\\frac{1}{3}$ =\n   0.142857142857... + 0.333333333333...\n   \nTo add the decimals, we need to make sure the repetition pattern starts at the same position. Since the pattern of $\\frac{1}{7}$ repeats after 6 digits and the pattern of $\\frac{1}{3}$ repeats after 1 digit, we need to adjust the pattern to a common repetition.\n\nLet's add the decimals up to the 20th digit after the decimal point:\n   We are looking at the position after the decimal point: \n   0.1.4.2.8.5.4.2.8.5.4.2.8.5.4.2.8.5.4.2.8\n   \nThe pattern for $\\frac{1}{7}$ is the pattern '142857', and the pattern for $\\frac{1}{3}$ is '3'. The repetition is 1 for $\\frac{1}{3}$ and 6 for $\\frac{1}{7}$. When we add both, the resulting pattern after 6 is the pattern for $\\frac{1}{7}$ alone, and after the next one, the pattern '345' appears.\n\nNow let's calculate a bit to the right: \n   142857 + 3 = 142860\n\nThe repetition pattern becomes: \n   142860 \u2248 142857 + 3 * 100000\n   142860 \u2248 142857 \u2248 (142857 + 3 * 10000 + 60) \n   which when rearranged gets 142857 + 60 and since the actual number is 3 * 10000 + 60 = 30060 the correct equation to attribute to every addition of a 3 after a number in the 142857 sequence which when 142857 gets added to 60 and 30060 of every 6 decimal becomes -142857 and prior - 3 when separated then gives a result when last - 3 added during sequence is evoked out:\n   145068\n\nNow it can be seen the addition's - 4 stacked on the third 142857 to note the first and second correct the pattern attribute a reoccuring : \n   -142857 + 4 since the pattern denotes to every first -
