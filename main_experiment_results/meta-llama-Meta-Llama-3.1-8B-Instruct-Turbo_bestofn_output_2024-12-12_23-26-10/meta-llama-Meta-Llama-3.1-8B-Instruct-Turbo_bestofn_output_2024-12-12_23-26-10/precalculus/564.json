    "To find the image of $2i$ under the given dilation, we first need to find the vector from the center of dilation to the point $2i$. \n\nThe center of dilation is $-1 + 4i$ and the point is $2i$. \n\nSo, the vector from the center to the point is $2i - (-1 + 4i) = 2i + 1 - 4i = 1 - 2i.$\n\nThe scale factor of the dilation is $-2$. \n\nTo apply the dilation, we multiply the vector from the center to the point by the scale factor. \n\nSo, $(-2)(1 - 2i) = -2 + 4i.$\n\nNow, to find the image of $2i$ under the dilation, we need to add the vector we obtained after multiplication by the scale factor to the center of dilation.\n\nSo, the image of $2i$ under the dilation is $(-1 + 4i) + (-2 + 4i) = -1 - 2 + 4i + 4i = -3 + 8i.$ \n\nTherefore, the image of $2i$ under the dilation is $\\boxed{-3 + 8i}.$",
    "To find the complex number that the dilation takes $2i$ to, we'll first translate the given dilation, so the center is at the origin. We'll then apply the scale factor and translate back.\n\nStep 1: Translate the dilation by subtracting the center from each complex number. \nWe want to find the translation of $2i$ by $-1 + 4i.$ This is the complex number \n$2i - (-1 + 4i)$ \nwhich simplifies to \n$2i + 1 - 4i$ \nsimplifying further to \n$1 - 2i$.\n\nStep 2: Apply the scale factor of $-2$ to the translated complex number. \nThe scale factor $-2$ times the translated complex number $1 - 2i$ is \n$-2(1 - 2i)$ \nwhich simplifies to \n$-2 + 4i$.\n\nStep 3: Translate back by adding the center $-1 + 4i$ to the translated complex number. \nThe translated complex number $-2 + 4i$ plus the center $-1 + 4i$ is \n$(-2 + 4i) + (-1 + 4i)$ \nwhich simplifies to \n$-3 + 8i$.\n\nTherefore, the dilation takes $2i$ to $\\boxed{-3 + 8i}$.",
    "To find the dilated point, we first need to find the vector pointing from the center of dilation to the point being dilated. In this case, the center of dilation is $-1 + 4i,$ and the point being dilated is $2i.$\n\nWe find the vector as follows: \nThe point $2i$ can also be written as $0 + 2i$. Subtracting the center of dilation $(-1 + 4i)$ or $-1 + 4i$ from $2i$ gives us a vector of $(0 - (-1)) + (2 -4)i = 1-2i$.\n\nNow we apply the dilation by multiplying the vector with the scale factor of -2: \n$-2 * (1-2i) = -2 +4i$.\n\nWe now add the center of dilation back to the result to ensure we're getting the correct location of the dilated point relative to the center of dilation. \nAdding the center of dilation to our result gives us: \n$-1+4i + (-2 +4i) = -3 + 8i.$ \n\nTherefore, the dilation, centered at $-1 + 4i,$ with a scale factor of $-2$, takes $2i$ to $\\boxed{-3 + 8i}$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. \n\nHowever, Solution 2 is the most straightforward and easiest to follow. It clearly breaks down the process into three steps: translating the dilation, applying the scale factor, and translating back. This makes it the most readable and understandable solution. \n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2. \n\nIndex: 2",
