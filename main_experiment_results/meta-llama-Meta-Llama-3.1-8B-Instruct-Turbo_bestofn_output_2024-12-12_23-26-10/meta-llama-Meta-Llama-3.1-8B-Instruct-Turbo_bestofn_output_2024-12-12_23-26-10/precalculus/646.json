    "To find $x$ such that the vectors are orthogonal, we need to ensure that their dot product is 0. The dot product of two vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix}$ is $ac + bd$.\n\nThe dot product of our vectors is $2x + (5)(-3) = 2x - 15$.\n\nFor the vectors to be orthogonal, their dot product must equal 0. Therefore, we can set up the equation $2x - 15 = 0$.\n\nNow, let's solve for $x$:\n\n$2x - 15 = 0$\n\nAdd 15 to both sides of the equation:\n\n$2x = 15$\n\nDivide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n$x = \\frac{15}{2}$\n\nSo, the value of $x$ that makes the vectors orthogonal is $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{2}}$.",
