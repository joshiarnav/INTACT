    "To find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion of the product, we need to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combine like terms.\n\nFirst polynomial: $(ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)$\nSecond polynomial: $(bx^2 - 7x - 4)$\n\nWe're interested in the $x^2$ term, which can be formed by multiplying the terms in the following ways:\n\n1. $3x^2 \\cdot bx^2$\n2. $-2x \\cdot -7x$\n\nNow, let's perform the multiplication:\n\n1. $3x^2 \\cdot bx^2 = 3bx^4$ (this doesn't give an $x^2$ term)\n2. $-2x \\cdot -7x = 14x^2$ (this gives an $x^2$ term)\n\nIn addition to these, we need to consider the product of $ax^3$ with $-7x$ and $-4$ and the product of $-2x$ with $bx^2$. However, we can ignore the terms $3x^2 \\cdot -7x$, $3x^2 \\cdot -4$, and $ax^3 \\cdot bx^2$ as they don't lead to an $x^2$ term. So, we have:\n\n$ax^3 \\cdot -7x = -7ax^4$ \n$ax^3 \\cdot -4 = -4ax^3$\n$-2x \\cdot bx^2 = -2bx^3$\n\nNow we have all the terms that give an $x^2$ in the following form:\n\n$14x^2 + 3bx^4 -7ax^4 -4ax^3 -2bx^3$.\n\nWhen combining the relevant $x^2$ terms we see:\n\n$14x^2 + 3bx^4 -7ax^4 -4ax^3 -2bx^3$\n\nNo further $x^2$ terms exist after combining above so the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is $\\boxed{14}$",
    "To find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion of the product, we need to find all possible combinations of terms from the two polynomials that will result in an $x^2$ term.\n\nThe first polynomial is $(ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)$ and the second polynomial is $(bx^2 - 7x - 4)$.\n\nThe possible combinations for $x^2$ term are:\n\n1. $3x^2$ from the first polynomial multiplied by the constant term $-4$ from the second polynomial: $(3x^2)(-4) = -12x^2$\n2.

    "To find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion, we need to multiply the two polynomials and identify all the terms with a degree of 2. \n\nThe two polynomials are:\n$(ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)$ and $(bx^2 - 7x - 4)$\n\nWe can use the distributive property to multiply each term in the first polynomial with each term in the second polynomial and then combine like terms.\n\nFirst, let's find the terms with $x^2$. Since the possible combinations of terms that can give $x^2$ are:\n\n* $3x^2$ multiplied by $-4$ (constant term in the second polynomial),\n* $-2x$ multiplied by $bx^2$ (the term with $x^2$ in the second polynomial),\n* $ax^3$ multiplied by $-7x$ (here we need to be careful, $x^3 \\cdot x$ is not $x^2$, but $ax^3 \\cdot -7x$ will result in $-7ax^4$).\n\nHowever, we can also multiply the $ax^3$ term in the first polynomial with the $-7x$ term in the second polynomial which would result in $-7ax^4$ and also the $ax^3$ term with the $-4$ constant, which would yield $-4ax^3$. We also multiply the $3x^2$ term in the first polynomial with the $-7x$ and $-4$ in the second polynomial to get $-21x^3$ and $-12x^2$ respectively.\n\nSo the possible combinations to get the $x^2$ term are: \n* $3x^2$ multiplied by $-4$, resulting in $-12x^2$\n* $-2x$ multiplied by $bx^2$, resulting in $-2bx^3$ which is not what we are looking for. However, the term we are looking for will be generated from multiplying $ax^3$ by $-7x$ and from multiplying $3x^2$ by $-7x$.\n\nHowever, there is no direct combination involving $x^2$ resulting from multiplying terms with the same degree, so we will have to look at other combinations. Given that $ax^3$ multiplied by the constant term $-4$ and also by $-7x$ as well as the term $3x^2$ and $-7x$ and the term $3x^2$ multiplied by $-4$ as the possible terms, we need to calculate these as follows:\n\n(-7a) * x^3 * x and (-4 * 3) * x^2 and the result for this combination is -7ax^4 (first, resulting in degree 4 term as expected) -12x^2.\n\nUsing this logic, let's find the coefficient for the term with degree $x^2$.\n\nWe have the terms $-12x^2$.\n\nThere is no other term involving $x^2$ in this expansion.\n\nHence, the coefficient of $x^2$ term in the expansion is $(-12) = \\boxed{-12}$."

However, Solution 1 incorrectly concludes that the only relevant terms are the ones that give $x^2$ directly when multiplied.\n\nBut if we look at the correct terms that are identified in Solution 1, we see that $-12x^2$ is the only term that is actually an $x^2$ term, and the other terms are not $x^2$ terms.\n\nHowever, Solution 2 also correctly identifies the term $-12x^2$ that is an $x^2$ term, and it also correctly identifies the term $14x^2$ that is an $x^2$ term.\n\nSo, if we look at the correct terms that are identified in Solution 2, we see that $-12x^2$ and $14x^2$ are both $x^2$ terms.\n\nNow, let's look at the final answer that is given in Solution 2, which is $-12 + 14 = 2$.
