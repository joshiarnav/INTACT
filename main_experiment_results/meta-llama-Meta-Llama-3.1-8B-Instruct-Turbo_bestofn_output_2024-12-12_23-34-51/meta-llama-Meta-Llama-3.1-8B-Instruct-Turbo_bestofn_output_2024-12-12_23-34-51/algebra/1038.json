    "To find the greatest integer n such that n^2 - 11n + 24 \u2264 0, let's first factorize the given quadratic expression:\n\nn^2 - 11n + 24 = (n - 3)(n - 8)\n\nNow we have factored the expression, we can set up inequalities to find the values of n:\n\n(n - 3)(n - 8) \u2264 0\n\nFor the product of two numbers to be less than or equal to zero, one number must be positive and the other must be negative.\n\nWe can set up three intervals to analyze the sign of the expression:\n\n1. When n - 3 and n - 8 are both negative (i.e., n < 3):\n   Both (n - 3) and (n - 8) are negative, so their product is positive.\n\n2. When n - 3 is negative and n - 8 is positive (i.e., 3 < n < 8):\n   (n - 3) is negative, and (n - 8) is positive, so their product is negative.\n\n3. When n - 3 and n - 8 are both positive (i.e., n > 8):\n   Both (n - 3) and (n - 8) are positive, so their product is positive.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that the expression is less than or equal to zero when 3 \u2264 n \u2264 8.\n\nThe greatest integer n within this range is 8.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{8}$",

  "solution": "We can factor $n^2-11n+24$ as $(n-3)(n-8)$. For this quantity to be less than or equal to 0, one of the factors must be less than or equal to 0 and the other factor must be greater than or equal to 0. Specifically, since $n-8<n-3$ for all $n$, we must have $$n-8 \\le 0 \\le n-3.$$ The first inequality, $n-8\\le 0$, tells us that $n\\le 8$. The second inequality, $0\\le n-3$, tells us that $n\\ge 3$. The solutions to the original inequality must satisfy both conditions, so they are given by $3\\le n\\le 8$. The largest integer in this interval is $n=\\boxed{8}$.",
