    "To rationalize the denominator, we need to get rid of the square root in the denominator. \n\nStep 1: Multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. \n\nThe conjugate of $\\sqrt{2} - 1$ is $\\sqrt{2} + 1$.\n\nSo, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}-1} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{\\sqrt{2}+1}$\n\nStep 2: Multiply out the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: $1 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} + 1 \\cdot 1 = \\sqrt{2} + 1$\n\nDenominator: $(\\sqrt{2} - 1)(\\sqrt{2} + 1) = \\sqrt{2}^2 - 1^2 = 2 - 1 = 1$\n\nStep 3: Now we have the fraction simplified, but we should simplify it further to ensure it's in its simplest form:\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{2} + 1}{1}$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$\\boxed{\\sqrt{2} + 1}$",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and lead to the same result. They all correctly identify the conjugate of the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate, and simplify the expression to get the rationalized form.\n\nHowever, Solution 1 and Solution 3 are slightly more detailed and clear in their explanation, especially in the simplification of the denominator using the difference of squares formula.\n\nBetween Solution 1 and Solution 3, Solution 1 is slightly more concise and directly mentions the difference of squares formula, making it a slightly better choice.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is: 1",
