    "To find the vertical asymptote of the given function, we need to determine the value of $x$ that makes the denominator equal to zero. \n\nThe denominator of the function is $5x - 7$. A vertical asymptote occurs when the denominator is equal to zero. \n\nSo, we need to set the denominator equal to zero and solve for $x$:\n\n$5x - 7 = 0$\n\nTo solve for $x$, add $7$ to both sides:\n\n$5x = 7$\n\nNext, divide both sides by $5$:\n\n$x = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\nTherefore, the vertical asymptote occurs at $x = \\frac{7}{5}$.",

  "critique": "All three solutions are mathematically correct. They correctly identify the denominator of the function, set it equal to zero, and solve for the value of x that results in a vertical asymptote.\n\nHowever, the best solution is Solution 1. It clearly explains the reasoning behind the steps and provides a detailed explanation of the process. The other solutions are more concise, but Solution 1 is more comprehensive and easier to follow.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "There is a vertical asymptote where the denominator equals 0 and thus $y$ is undefined. For the denominator to equal 0, we have $5x-7=0\\Rightarrow x=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{5}}$.",
