    "To solve this problem, we'll start by substituting $x$ into the given equation $h(4x-1) = 2x + 7$. \n\nLet's substitute $4x - 1$ with a variable, let's say $u$. So we have:\n\n$u = 4x - 1$\n\nThen:\n\n$x = \\frac{u + 1}{4}$\n\nNow we substitute $x$ in the equation $h(u) = 2x + 7$ with $\\frac{u + 1}{4}$. This gives us:\n\n$h(u) = 2\\left(\\frac{u + 1}{4}\\right) + 7$\n\n$h(u) = \\frac{u}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + 7$\n\n$h(u) = \\frac{u}{2} + \\frac{15}{2}$\n\nNow that we have the function $h(u)$, we need to find the value of $x$ for which $h(x) = x$. \n\nSetting the function $h(x)$ equal to $x$, we have:\n\n$x = \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{15}{2}$\n\nNow let's solve for $x$. \n\nSubtracting $\\frac{x}{2}$ from both sides gives:\n\n$\\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{15}{2}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $2$ gives:\n\n$x = 15$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ for which $h(x) = x$ is $\\boxed{15}$.",

    "To find the value of x for which h(x) = x, we first need to find the function h(x). \n\nWe are given h(4x - 1) = 2x + 7. To eliminate the variable x in the argument, we can try to substitute. However, we can simplify this problem by plugging 1/(4) into the argument to set the function to the equation. \n\nGiven: h(4x-1) = 2x + 7\n\nSetting x to be (1/4)*(t+1)= x where t is our variable:\n4*(x) - 1 = t\nx = (1/4)*(t+1)\n2*((1/4)*(t+1)) + 7 = h(t)\n\nh(t) = (1/2)*(t+1) + 7 = (t+1+14)/2 = (t+15)/2\n\nNow that we have a function in terms of t, which is a different variable than x, we can substitute h(t) = t. Therefore: \n\nh(t) = t\n(t+ 15/2) = t\nSubtracting t from each side leaves us with:\n15/2 = 0 \n\nWhich should be equivalent to.\nt+15/2 - t = 0\n(15/2) - 0 = 0\n Multiplying both sides by 2 results in 15 = 0 which is definitely false. The mistake was that when the 15/2 was moved to the left side of the equation it got multiplied by 2 as well. Multiplying both sides by 2 will result in this  2 times 15/2 = 15, it has no effect on 0 on the other side of the equation. This should be : \n\n 15/2 =  0\nAt this point we think: \nWhat went wrong? The issue is that when t+15/2 = t, we can't  move the 15/2 to the other side because that is giving  us  0 on the right hand side. And, because  t+ 15/2 = t implies that t = -15/2. But this solution must be ignored for a reason.\n\nThe function h(x) = (x+15)/2. To find where h(x) = x, we substitute h(x) for x in the equation h(x) = x. This results in:\n\nh(x) = x\n((x+15)/2) = x\n\nWe can now multiply the left-hand side of the equation by 2, leaving us with:\n\n(x+15) = 2x\n\nWe can then move 2x to the left-hand side of the equation, subtracting 2x from each side of the equation leaves us with:\n\nx+15-2x = 0\n-x+15 = 0\n\nThen, we can add x to both sides of the equation to isolate the 15 on one side. \n-x + 15 + x = 0 + x \nThe x's cancel out and we are left with 15 on one side: \n\n15 = x\n\nThe original function h(x) was found by plugging 1/4 into the argument 4x - 1. The issue with the new variable is not its value but that when  h(t) = t then t = -15/2 which is not a solution to the problem. We don't want -15/2. Instead, we want the solution 15. This is  the solution.\nThe answer is  $\\boxed{15}.$"
