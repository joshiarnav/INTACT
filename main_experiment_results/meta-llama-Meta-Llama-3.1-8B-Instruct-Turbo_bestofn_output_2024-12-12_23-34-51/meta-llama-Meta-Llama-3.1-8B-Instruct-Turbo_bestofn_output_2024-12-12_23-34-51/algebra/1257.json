    "To find the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$, we need to analyze the behavior of the function $f(x) = x^k$ where $k < 0$.\n\nSince $k < 0$, the function $f(x)$ is a decreasing function as $x$ increases.

    "To find the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the function**: The given function is $f(x) = x^k$, where $k < 0$. This means that $f(x)$ is a decreasing function (because when $k$ is negative, as $x$ increases, $f(x)$ decreases) and it's a power function with a negative exponent.\n\n2. **Behavior of the function**: Since $k < 0$, we know that $f(x) = x^k$ will approach $0$ as $x$ approaches $\\infty$. This is because the negative exponent causes the function to decrease rapidly as $x$ increases.\n\n3. **Interval of interest**: The interval of interest is $[1, \\infty)$. To find the range of $f(x)$ on this interval, we need to consider the behavior of the function on this interval.\n\n4. **Evaluating the function at the endpoints**: The left endpoint of the interval is $x = 1$. Evaluating the function at this point, we get:\n\n$f(1) = 1^k = 1$, since any non-zero number raised to the power of $0$ is $1$ or any number raised to a non-negative power will always be positive as long as the bases is not negative.\n\n5. **Behavior of the function on the interval**: Since $k < 0$, $f(x) = x^k$ decreases on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. Therefore, the smallest value of $f(x)$ occurs at the right endpoint of the interval (as $x$ approaches $\\infty$), which we already determined to be $0$.\n\n6. **Determining the range**: The smallest value of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ is $0$ (since the function approaches $0$ as $x$ approaches $\\infty$), and the largest value is $1$ (since $f(1) = 1$). Therefore, the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ is $[0, 1)$.\n\nHowever, this answer is not in an explicitly boxed format. Based on the analysis we've done, here's the answer in the required format, but let's just click \"BELOW\" to see how the range truly should be presented."

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, we need to analyze each solution for correctness.\n\nSolution 1: This solution correctly identifies that the function $f(x) = x^k$ is decreasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ since $k < 0$.

  "solution": "We are looking at the range of $f(x)$ when $x$ is in the interval $[1,\\infty)$. Because $k < 0$, $f(x)$ is decreasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. We see that $f(1) = 1^k = 1$, and as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ approaches 0, but never reaches it.
