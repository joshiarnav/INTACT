    "Let's break down the problem step by step. \n\n1. Let's denote the miles Phoenix hiked each day as D1, D2, D3, and D4. \n\nGiven that the first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles: \n- D1 + D2 = 22 \n\nGiven that the second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day:\n- (D2 + D3) / 2 = 13 \n- D2 + D3 = 26 \n\nGiven that the last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles: \n- D3 + D4 = 30 \n\nGiven that the total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles: \n- D1 + D3 = 26 \n\n2. Now, let's combine the given equations. \n\nFrom D1 + D2 = 22 and D1 + D3 = 26, we can find D3 - D2 = 26 - 22 = 4.\n\nNow we know D2 + D3 = 26 and D3 - D2 = 4, so D3 = (D2 + D3) + (D3 - D2))/2 = (D2 + D2 + 4)/2 = (2D2 + 4)/2 = D2 + 2. \n- 26 = D2 + (D2 + 2) \n- 26 = 2D2 + 2 \n- 24 = 2D2 \n- D2 = 12 \n\nSince D2 = 12, we have D1 = 22 - D2 = 22 - 12 = 10 and D3 = 26 - D1 = 26 - 10 = 16.\n\n3. Now that we know the values for D1, D2, and D3, let's calculate D4. Given D3 + D4 = 30:\n- 30 = 16 + D4 \n- D4 = 14\n\n4. Now that we know the values for D1, D2, D3, and D4, we can find the total length of the trail:\n- D1 + D2 + D3 + D4 = 10 + 12 + 16 + 14 = 52 \n\nThe trail is 52 miles long: \n$\\boxed{52}$",
