    "To find the value of the given expression as a common fraction, we can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series. \n\nA geometric series is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. \n\nThe formula for the sum of a finite geometric series is:\n\nS = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nwhere:\n- S is the sum of the series\n- a is the first term\n- r is the common ratio\n- n is the number of terms\n\nIn this case, the first term (a) is 1/3^1 = 1/3, the common ratio (r) is also 1/3, and the number of terms (n) is 6.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nS = (1/3) * (1 - (1/3)^6) / (1 - 1/3)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n(1/3)^6 = 1/729\n\nSo, we get:\n\nS = (1/3) * (1 - 1/729) / (2/3)\n\nSimplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n1 - 1/729 = (729 - 1)/729 = 728/729\n\nNow, substitute this value back into the equation:\n\nS = (1/3) * (728/729) / (2/3)\n\nTo divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:\n\nS = (1/3) * (728/729) * (3/2)\n\nCancel out the common factors:\n\nS = (728/729) * (1/2)\n\nCombine the fractions (if necessary) and simplify the expression.\n\nMultiply the numerators and denominators together:\n\n(728/729) * (1/2) = (728 * 1) / (729 * 2)\n\n= 728 / 1458\n\n= 364 / 729\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression as a common fraction is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{364}{729}}$"
