    "To find the maximum height of the ball, we need to analyze the expression for height: $-16t^2+80t+21$.\n\nStep 1: The maximum height usually occurs at the vertex of a parabola. To find the vertex of a parabola represented by $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, we can use the formula: $t = -\\frac{b}{2a}$.\n\nStep 2: Identify the coefficients: $a = -16$ and $b = 80$.\n\nStep 3: Apply the formula: $t = -\\frac{80}{2(-16)}$.\n\nStep 4: Simplify: $t = -\\frac{80}{-32}$.\n\nStep 5: Reduce fraction: $t = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nStep 6: To verify if this is a maximum or minimum, we can look at the coefficient of the quadratic expression: $a = -16$ (negative). This means that the parabola opens downward and the point we found is indeed the maximum.\n\nStep 7: Now that we have the time when the maximum height occurs, we can plug this value into the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$ to find the height.\n\nStep 8: Substitute $t = \\frac{5}{2}$: $h = -16\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2+80\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)+21$.\n\nStep 9: Simplify: $h = -16\\left(\\frac{25}{4}\\right)+200+21$.\n\nStep 10: Further simplify: $h = -100+200+21$.\n\nStep 11: Calculate: $h = 121$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum height of the ball is $\\boxed{121}$.",

For a quadratic function $f(t) = at^2+bt+c$, the critical point occurs when $2at+b=0$. \n\nStep 2: In our case, $a=-16$ and $b=80$. \n\nSo, we can plug in the values into the formula: \n$2(-16)t+80 = 0$\n$-16t + 80 = 0$\n$-16t = -80$\n$t = \\frac{-80}{-16}$\n$t = 5$\n\nStep 3: Now that we know the time when the maximum height is achieved, we need to plug in this value into the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$. \n\nMaximum height $= -16(5)^2+80(5)+21$\n$= -16(25)+400+21$\n$= -400+400+21$\n$= 21$\n\nTherefore, the maximum height of the ball is $\\boxed{21}$ feet.",

  "solution": "To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \\[-16t^2+80t+21=-16(t^2-5t)+21\\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-5/2)^2=6.25$ inside the parenthesis to get \\begin{align*}\n-16(t^2-5t)+21&=-16(t^2-5t+6.25-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16([t-2.5]^2-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16(t-2.5)^2+121\n\\end{align*}Since $-16(t-2.5)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-2.5)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+121=\\boxed{121}$ feet.",
