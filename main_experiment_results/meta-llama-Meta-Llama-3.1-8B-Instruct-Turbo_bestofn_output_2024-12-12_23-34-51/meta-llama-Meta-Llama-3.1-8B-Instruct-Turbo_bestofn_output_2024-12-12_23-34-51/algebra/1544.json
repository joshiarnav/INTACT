    "To simplify $\\sqrt[3]{2744000}$, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Find the prime factorization of the number**:\n\n   Start by breaking down 2744000 into its prime factors:\n\n   - Divide by 2 (as many times as possible): 2744000 \u00f7 2 = 1372000\n   - Divide by 2 again: 1372000 \u00f7 2 = 686000\n   - Continue dividing by 2: 686000 \u00f7 2 = 343000\n   - Divide by 2 again: 343000 \u00f7 2 = 171500\n   - Continue dividing by 2: 171500 \u00f7 2 = 85750\n   - Divide by 2 again: 85750 \u00f7 2 = 42875\n   - Continue dividing by 2: 42875 \u00f7 2 = 21437.5 (not a whole number, stop here)\n   - 21437.5 was close to 2^4 times 2143 then 2143 is a prime number.\n\n   The prime factorization of 2744000 is: 2^6 * 5^3 * 7 * 163 * 23, or: $2^6 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 163 \\cdot 23$ \n\n2. **Group factors in triples**:\n\nNow, we need to group the factors in triples, as we are looking for the cube root. Grouping factors in triples also involves simplifying each triple:\n\n- Group the powers of 2 in triples, but we do not have enough powers of 2 to do that yet.\n- Group $5^3$ in a triple, since $5^3$ is exactly 3 times 5.\n- Group the remaining factors as singles.\n\n   The given setup now becomes: $(5^3)\\cdot (2^6)\\cdot (2^6)\\cdot (2^6)\\cdot 7\\cdot 23\\cdot 163$\n\n3. Yet we have 3 triples with the 2s, to simplify we need to arrange them in triple sets so a cube root can be applied, simplifying:\n   This can be simplified as: $(2^6)\\cdot (2^6)\\cdot (2^6) = (2^18)$\n   which arises from $(2^6)\\cdot (2^6)\\cdot (2^6)$ and, we re-apply the initial cube root.\n\n   This simplifies the cube root to, in essence: $5^1\\cdot(2^18)^{1/3}$ = $5^1\\cdot2^6$ which further simplifies into $2^6\\cdot5^1$ \n\nTherefore, $\\sqrt[3]{2744000} = \\boxed{800}$",

    "To simplify $\\sqrt[3]{2744000}$, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Identify perfect cube factors of the given number, 2744000. \n   One approach is to guess and check different perfect cubes.\n\n2. We can start by looking at the factors of 2744000.\n   2744000 can be written as 2 * 1372000,\n   1372000 can be written as 2 * 685000,\n   685000 can be written as 2 * 342500,\n   342500 can be written as 2 * 171250,\n   171250 can be written as 5 * 34250,\n   34250 can be written as 2* 17125,\n   17125 can be written as 5* 3425,\n   3425 can be written as 5 * 685,\n   685 can be written as 5 * 137.\n\n3. So the factors are 2 * 2 * 2 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 137. Now try to arrange 137 to fit the formula we need for a perfect cube this we follow as: \n    (a * a * a) * (b * b * b) * (c * c * c)\n\n    try multiplying the factors for (a*a*a): \n    a * a * a = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8\n    (b*b*b) try factoring these for the perfect cube:\n    b*b*b = 5 * 5 * 5 = 125\n\n    c*c*c we are trying to find\n    2744000/ (8* 125) = 16 as c*c*c = 16 * 16 * 16.\n\n4. Reuse the formula to find a, b, and c.\n    (a*a*a) = 8 so a * a * a = 2*2*2, a = 2\n    (b*b*b) = 125 so b * b * b = 5*5*5, b = 5 \n    (c*c*c) = 4096 so c * c* c = 16* 16* 16, c = 16 \n\n    combining this we follow the as:\n    8*125* 16 * 16 *16 *137 \n\n   Hence simplifying the equation follows as\n   2744000 = (2*2*2)*(5*5*5)*(16*16*16)*137.\n\n   the factoring as  2744000 can be written as 2 * 1372000\n   Removed the 2 * 2 * 2 we follow as:\n    1372000 follow 2*685000 we follow as:\n    {removing 685000) follow as:\n    1372000 can be written as \n   2*2*2 follow as: \n    1372  follow as  685 \n    685 follow as: 5 *137 \n\n    Finally follow 2744000 can be written as:\n    (2 *2 *2) * (5 *5 *5) * 4096*137 (i.e. 8 * 125 *  16*16 * 16) *137.\n\n    Finally ee combine them 2744000 can be written as \n    8 *125 * 16 *16 * 16 * 137 as:\n    {8 *125 follow  16 *16 follow 16} 2744000 can be written as \n    8 * 125 * 4096*137 follow = 8 *125 * 16 *16*16*137 \n   Hence  2744000 can be written as \n    8*125* 16 *16 *16 * 137 (i.e. 8*5 *5 * 5 *16 *16 *16* 137)\n\n    Now\n    $\\sqrt[3]{2744000}$ can be as:\n   8*5* 5* 5*16*16*16* 137 \n   8*5* 5* 5*16*16*16 = 8 *5 *5 *5   * 16  * 16 *  16 \n\n   8 *5 *5 *5 follow 16 * 16 * 16 \n   Finally   $\\sqrt[3]{2744000}$ follows\n   (8 *125 * 4096) * 137 this follows follow 8*5 *5* 5*16 * 16 *16 \n   8*5* 5 * 5 can be written as \n\n   $\\boxed{176}$"
