    "To find the sum, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. \n\nThe formula is: \n\nSum = (n * (a1 + an)) / 2\n\nwhere:\n- n = number of terms\n- a1 = first term\n- an = last term\n\nIn the problem, the first term (a1) is 1, and the last term (an) is 49. \n\nThe number of terms (n) can be calculated by subtracting the first term from the last term, and then adding 1 (since both ends are inclusive).\n\nn = 49 - 1 + 1\nn = 49\n\nHowever, that isn't accurate since the correct number of terms is 49. \n\nn is actually the 49th number so, lets clarify:\n\nn = 49 (it actually is and we use this).\n\nNow, we plug in these values into the formula:\n\nSum = (49 * (1 + 49)) / 2\nSum = (49 * 50) / 2\nSum = 2450 / 2\nSum = 1225\n\nSo, the sum is: \n$\\boxed{1225}$",
    "To find the sum, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. \n\nLet's think step by step:\n\n1. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\n   S = n \u00d7 (a1 + an) / 2\n\n   Where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\n\n2. In this case, we have a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at 49, with each term increasing by 1.\n\n   So, a1 = 1 and an = 49.\n\n3. To find the number of terms (n), we can use the formula:\n\n   n = (an - a1) + 1\n\n   Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n   n = (49 - 1) + 1\n   n = 49\n\n4.

    "To find the sum of the series $1+2+3+4+\\dots +48+49$, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n\nAn arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. \n\nGiven that the first term is 1 and the common difference is 1, the series starts with 1 and each subsequent term increases by 1.\n\nThe number of terms in the series can be calculated as the difference between the last term (49) and the first term (1), divided by the common difference (1), and then add 1 (to include both the first and last term).\n\nNumber of terms = (last term - first term) / common difference + 1\nNumber of terms = (49 - 1) / 1 + 1\nNumber of terms = 48 / 1 + 1\nNumber of terms = 49\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \n\nS = (n/2) * (a + l), \nwhere S = sum of the series,\nn = number of terms,\na = first term, and\nl = last term.\n\nPlugging in the values for the series, we get:\nS = (49/2) * (1 + 49)\nS = (24.5) * 50\nS = 1225\n\nTherefore, the sum of the series $1+2+3+4+\\dots +48+49$ is $\\boxed{1225}$."
