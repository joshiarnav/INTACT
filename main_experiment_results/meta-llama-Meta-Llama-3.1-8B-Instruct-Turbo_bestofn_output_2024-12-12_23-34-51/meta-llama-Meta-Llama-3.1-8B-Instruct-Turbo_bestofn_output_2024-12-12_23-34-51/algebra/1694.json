    "Let's denote the weight of the puppy as \\( P \\), the weight of the larger cat as \\( L \\), and the weight of the smaller cat as \\( S \\).\n\nGiven that:\n1. The puppy and two cats together weigh 24 pounds: \\( P + L + S = 24 \\)\n2. The puppy and the larger cat together weigh exactly twice as much as the smaller cat: \\( P + L = 2S \\)\n3. The puppy and the smaller cat together weigh exactly the same as the larger cat: \\( P + S = L \\)\n\nFrom (3), we can substitute \\( L \\) with \\( P + S \\) into (1) and (2):\n1. \\( P + (P + S) + S = 24 \\) simplifies to \\( 2P + 2S = 24 \\) or \\( P + S = 12 \\)\n2. \\( P + (P + S) = 2S \\) simplifies to \\( 2P + S = 2S \\), which further simplifies to \\( 2P = S \\)\n\nNow, using the information in (1) where we know that \\( P + S = 12 \\) and we also know that \\( 2P = S \\), we can rewrite (1) by substituting \\( S = 2P \\) into (1):\n\\( P + 2P + 2P = 24 \\) This simplifies to \\( 5P = 24 \\), so we get \\( P = 24 / 5 \\), which may be incorrectly simplified.\n\nSo, let's really check our algebra: If \\( P + S = 12 \\), then if \\( 2P = S \\) then \\( 2P + P = 12 \\), so \\( 3P = 12 \\), or \\( P = 4 \\) pounds.\n\nSo the puppy weighs $\\boxed{4}$ pounds.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step. \n\n1. Let the weight of the puppy be 'p' pounds, the weight of the smaller cat be 's' pounds, and the weight of the larger cat be 'l' pounds.\n\n2. From the given information, we can form the following equations:\n   - The puppy and two cats together weigh 24 pounds: p + s + l = 24.\n   - The puppy and the larger cat together weigh exactly twice as much as the smaller cat: p + l = 2s.\n   - The puppy and the smaller cat together weigh exactly the same as the larger cat: p + s = l.\n\n3. Using the third equation (p + s = l) and substituting it into the first equation (p + s + l = 24), we get p + s + (p + s) = 24, which simplifies to 2p + 2s = 24.\n\n4. Dividing the equation from step 3 by 2, we get p + s = 12.\n\n5. Now, we can substitute p + s = 12 (from step 4) into the third equation p + s = l, so we get l = 12.\n\n6. Now, we can substitute p + s = 12 (from step 4) into the second equation p + l = 2s, so we get p + 12 = 2s.\n\n7. Using the equation from step 6 (p + 12 = 2s), we can express s as s = (p + 12)/2 = (p/2) + 6.\n\n8. Now, we can substitute s = (p/2) + 6 (from step 7) into the equation p + s = 12 from step 4: p + ((p/2) + 6) = 12.\n\n9. Simplifying the equation in step 8 gives us p + (0.5)p + 6 = 12.\n\n10. Combining like terms in the equation from step 9 gives us 1.5p + 6 = 12.\n\n11. Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation in step 10 gives us 1.5p = 6.\n\n12. Dividing both sides of the equation in step 11 by 1.5 gives us p = 4.\n\nTherefore, the puppy weighs $\\boxed{4}$ pounds.",
    "To solve this problem, let's denote the weights of the puppy, the smaller cat, and the larger cat as p, c1, and c2, respectively. \n\nWe are given two pieces of information:\n1. The puppy and two cats together weigh 24 pounds: p + c1 + c2 = 24.\n2. The puppy and the larger cat together weigh exactly twice as much as the smaller cat: p + c2 = 2c1.\n3. The puppy and the smaller cat together weigh exactly the same as the larger cat: p + c1 = c2.\n\nWe can use these equations to solve for the weights. \n\nFirst, let's solve equation (2) for c1: \nc1 = (p + c2) / 2\n\nNow, let's substitute this expression for c1 in equation (3): \np + (p + c2) / 2 = c2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to simplify the equation: \n2p + p + c2 = 2c2\n\nCombine like terms: \n3p + c2 = 2c2\n\nSubtract c2 from both sides: \n3p = c2\n\nNow, substitute c2 = 3p into equation (1): \np + c1 + 3p = 24\n\nCombine like terms: \n4p + c1 = 24\n\nNow, let's substitute c1 = (p + c2) / 2 into the above equation. Since c2 = 3p, \nc1 = (p + 3p) / 2 \nc1 = 2p / 2 \nc1 = p\n\nNow, substitute c1 = p into the equation: \n4p + p = 24\n\nCombine like terms: \n5p = 24 \n\nDivide both sides by 5: \np = 24 / 5 \np = 4.8 \n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4.8}$"

  "solution": "Let the weight of the puppy be $a$, the weight of the smaller cat be $b$, and the weight of the larger cat be $c$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c&=24\\\\\na+c&=2b\\\\\na+b&=c\n\\end{align*} From Equation (2), we have $a=2b-c$. Substituting that into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b+c=24 \\Rightarrow b=8\n\\end{align*} Substituting $a=2b-c$ into Equation (3) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b&=c \\Rightarrow 3b=2c\n\\end{align*} Since $b=8$, $c=\\frac{3}{2}b=12$. Finally, substituting the values of $b$ and $c$ into Equation (1) to solve for $a$, we have $a+8+12=24$, or $a=4$. Thus, the puppy weighs $\\boxed{4}$ pounds.",
