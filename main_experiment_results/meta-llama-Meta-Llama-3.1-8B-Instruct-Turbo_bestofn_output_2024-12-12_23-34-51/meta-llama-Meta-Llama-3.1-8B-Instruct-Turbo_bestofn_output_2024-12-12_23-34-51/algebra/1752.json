    "To find the value of b, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the midpoint of the line segment from (2,5) to (4,9).\n2. Substitute the coordinates of the midpoint into the equation of the line x+y=b.\n\nFirst, let's find the midpoint of the line segment. The formula for the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is:\n\n(x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2\n\nFor our given endpoints, the midpoint would be:\n\n((2 + 4)/2, (5 + 9)/2)\n= (6/2, 14/2)\n= (3, 7)\n\nNow that we have the midpoint, let's substitute the coordinates (3, 7) into the equation of the line x+y=b.\n\nSubstituting x = 3 and y = 7 into the equation x+y=b, we get:\n\n3 + 7 = b\n\nb = 10\n\nTherefore, the value of b is 10.",
