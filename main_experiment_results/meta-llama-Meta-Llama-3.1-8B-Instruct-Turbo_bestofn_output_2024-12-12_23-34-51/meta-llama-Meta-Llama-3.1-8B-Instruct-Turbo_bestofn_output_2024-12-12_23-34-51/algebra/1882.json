    "To find the value of $\\lfloor |-4.2| \\rfloor + |\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor|$, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to calculate the absolute value of -4.2, which is $|-4.2| = 4.2$.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the floor of this absolute value, which is the largest integer less than or equal to $4.2$. The floor of $4.2$ is $\\lfloor 4.2 \\rfloor = 4$.\n\n3. Then, we take the floor of -4.2. The floor of a negative number is the next integer below it, but still negative. So, $\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor = -5$.\n\n4. After that, we take the absolute value of this result, which is $|-5| = 5$.\n\n5. Now, add the two results together: $4 + 5 = 9$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$.",
