    "Since the common difference is 6 and we have prime numbers, we can analyze the possible ones digits for primes greater than 5.\n\nThe possible ones digits for primes greater than 5 are 1, 3, 7, and 9.\n\nNow, let's create a sequence using each possible ones digit for the primes, starting from $a=10x+1$, $b=10y+3$, $c=10z+7$, $d=10w+9$ with $x, y, z, w$ being integers.\n\nAfter substitution into $b-a=6$ for the first pair, we get:\n$$(10y+3) - (10x+1) = 6$$ \n$$ \\Rightarrow 10y - 10x +2 = 6$$ \n$$ \\Rightarrow 10(y-x) = 4$$ \n$$ \\Rightarrow  y-x  = \\frac{4}{10}$$ \nSince we have an integer in $y-x$, we see that this case will not work.\n\nNow for the second pair with $c-b=6$, we get: \n$$(10z+7)-(10y+3) = 6$$ \n$$ \\Rightarrow 10z - 10y + 4 = 6$$ \n$$ \\Rightarrow 10(z-y) = 2$$ \n$$ \\Rightarrow z-y = \\frac{1}{5}$$\nAgain we see that we have an integer, hence this case will not work.\n\nNext, we analyze the sequence with $a = 10x + 3$, $b = 10y + 7$ and  $c = 10z + 9$ since $d$ would have a ones digit of 5, and this is in contradiction to our initial condition that $a>5$.\n\nFinally, with $a = 10x + 7$, $b = 10y + 9$, we get: \n$$(10y + 9) - (10x + 7) = 6$$ \n$$ \\Rightarrow 10y-10x +2 = 6$$ \n$$ \\Rightarrow 10(y-x) = 4$$ \n$$ \\Rightarrow y-x = \\frac{4}{10}$$ \nAgain, we have an integer, hence this case won't work.\n\nNow let's look at our sequence from another angle. Given $a = 10x + 1$, $b = 10x + 7$, $c = 10x + 13$ we find that the first pair does not work, but the last two pairs do. With $a = 10x + 1$, we see that for the primes to be greater than 5, $x \\neq 0, x \\neq 1$. With  $x \\le 1,$ the primes won't satisfy the condition $a>5$.\n\nNow let's substitute our values for $b = 10x + 7$ and $c = 10x + 13$ into $c - b = 6$. \n$b= 10x+7, c=10x+13$. We have: \n$$(10x+13)- (10x +7) = 6$$ \n$$ \\Rightarrow 6 = 6$$ \nwhich is correct.\n\nAlso, if we create another number $d$ with a difference of 6, we'd see this number would be equal to $10x + 19, $. However, this number, $d$, does not have the common difference as set out in the initial problem, so the numbers $a, b, c,$ and $d$ don't follow the sequence we're looking for and hence this number won't satisfy the initial problem, $a, b, c,$ and $d$ form an increasing arithmetic sequence.\n\nUsing these values we can try other $x$ values, in order to make sure that we find all the prime numbers.\n\nWhen we set $x$ equal to 2, the values are $a = 17, b = 23, $ and $c = 29$. These are prime numbers and, indeed follow the arithmetic progression $17 + 6 = 23, 23 + 6 = 29, 29 + 6 = 35.$",
    "Since we know that the primes $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ form an increasing arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6, we can write $b = a + 6$, $c = a + 12$, and $d = a + 18$.\n\nAlso, we are given that $a > 5$, which implies that the first prime number greater than 5 is 7. This makes the possible numbers $a$ can be equal to multiples of 6 plus 7. \n\nChecking the first few possible values for $a$:\n7 + 6 = 13 (prime)\n7 + 12 = 19 (prime)\n7 + 18 = 25 (not prime)\n13 + 6 = 19 (prime)\nThis makes possible numbers for $a$ equal to 7, 13.\n\nThe only options left are to check primes of any multiple of $6$ greater than 5 to obtain a number of any primes $a$ could be equal to.\nPossible options are $\\{7 + 30, 7 + 36,\\cdots\\}=\\{37, 43, \\cdots \\}$.\n\nHowever, considering these values are majorly higher values (majorly larger values beyond $a$, $b$ , $c$, $d$ ),This test will help you fast obtain the result. \n\nIf you have a look at them and check for a good number of primes to be consecutive in line ($a > 5$, they are consecutive in a line with major D if = 6), $a$ is actually equal to 11 because \n\n$11$ + $6$ = $17$ (prime), \n$11$ + $12$ = $23$ (prime), \n$11$ + $18$ = $29$ (prime).\n$17$ + $6$ = $23$ (prime), \n$17$ + $12$ = $29$ (prime),\n$17$ + $18$ = $35$ (not prime)\n\n$\\boxed{1}$",
    "Given that $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are four primes forming an increasing arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6, we can write the sequence as:\n\n$a$, $a+6$, $a+12$, $a+18$\n\nWe are also given that $a > 5$ and all four numbers are prime.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the possible values of the ones digit of $a$.\nThe only prime numbers greater than 5 that end with 6, 1, 7, 9, or 3 are $11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89,$ and $97.$\nHowever, we should consider ones digits of these primes for this specific problem.\n\nStep 2: The ones digit of $a$ can be 1, 3, 7, or 9 to ensure that $a+6, a+12, a+18$ have ones digits of 7, 3, 9, or 5, 9, 5, 1, respectively.\n\nStep 3: Focus on those numbers whose digits after adding 6 do not come from 7 + 6. Since, we cannot end up with 3 or 6 after adding 6 to any number that ends in 7. Thus, a can't end with a 7. The digits after adding 6 to a number end with a 1 can lead to either a number ending in 3 or 7, thus eliminating a number ending with a 1.\n\nStep 4: Analyze what does the ones digits of the other numbers after adding 6.\n-   If $a$ ends in 1, $a + 6$ will end in 7.\n-   If $a$ ends in 1, $a + 12$ will end in 3.\n-   If $a$ ends in 1, $a + 18$ will end in 9.\n-   If $a$ ends in 3, $a + 6$ will end in 9\n-   If $a$ ends in 3, $a + 12$ will end in 5.\n-   If $a$ ends in 3, $a + 18$ will end in 1.\n-   If $a$ ends in 9, $a+6$ ends in 5\n-   If $a$ ends in 9, $a + 12$ ends in 7\n-   If $a$ ends in 9, $a + 18$ ends in 3\n \nStep 5: The digits after adding 6 to a number end with a 5 implies, we cannot end up with a 5 or 7, thus a number that ends with a 9 is not possible because we would have gotten 7.\n\nStep 6: From Step 5 we see that the only possible number is $a$ must be 1, since $a$ is prime.\n\nNow we find $answer$ is $\\boxed{1}$."

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I found that Solution 1 is incorrect because it incorrectly concludes that the first pair does not work, but the last two pairs do.

The solution is clear, concise, and easy to follow.\n\nSolution 3 is also a good solution, but it is more complex and less straightforward than Solution 2. It involves more steps and calculations, but it still arrives at the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2. The index number of the best solution is 2.",
