    "To find the inverse of the function $f(x)$, we need to swap $x$ and $y$, and then solve for $y$.\n\nStep 1: Write the original function as $y = 4 - 5x$.\n\nStep 2: Swap $x$ and $y$ to get $x = 4 - 5y$.\n\nStep 3: Solve for $y$: \n$x = 4 - 5y$\n$5y = 4 - x$\n$y = (4 - x)/5$\n\nThis is the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$.\n\n$\\boxed{f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{4-x}{5}}$",
    "To find the inverse of the function $f(x) = 4 - 5x$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Replace $f(x)$ with $y$: $y = 4 - 5x$\n\n2. Swap $x$ and $y$: $x = 4 - 5y$\n\n3. Now we need to solve for $y$. Let's start by isolating the constant term:\n   $x - 4 = -5y$\n\n4. To isolate $y$, we need to divide both sides by $-5$:\n   $\\frac{x-4}{-5} = y$\n\n5.

    "To find the inverse of the function $f(x) = 4 - 5x$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Let $y = f(x)$. This is the original function with y as the dependent variable.\n   $y = 4 - 5x$\n\n2. Swap the x and y variables in the equation.\n   $x = 4 - 5y$\n\n3. Now, solve this equation for y. This will give us the inverse function.\n   First, move the constant term to the other side of the equation:\n   $x - 4 = -5y$\n\n   Then, multiply both sides by -1 to isolate y:\n   $-x + 4 = 5y$\n\n   Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for y:\n   $y = \\frac{-x + 4}{5}$\n\n   This can be rewritten as:\n   $y = \\frac{4 - x}{5}$\n\n   But we are trying to find the inverse function in terms of x. To get that, we'll replace y with the inverse function f inverse of x, which we denote as $f^{-1}(x)$. \n   So, the inverse function is:\n   $\\boxed{f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{4 - x}{5}}$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They follow the same steps to find the inverse of the function $f(x) = 4 - 5x$. However, Solution 1 and Solution 2 are more concise and directly solve for $y$, while Solution 3 provides a few extra steps that are not necessary.\n\nBut since all solutions are correct, I will choose the one that is most concise and straightforward. \n\nThe best solution is: \n2",
  "solution": "If we let $g(x)$ denote the inverse to $f$ then we can evaluate $f$ at $g(x)$ to get  \\[f(g(x))=4-5g(x).\\]Since $g$ is the inverse to $f$, the left side is $x$ and  \\[x=4-5g(x).\\]Solving for $g(x)$, we find $g(x) = \\boxed{\\frac{4-x}{5}}$.",
