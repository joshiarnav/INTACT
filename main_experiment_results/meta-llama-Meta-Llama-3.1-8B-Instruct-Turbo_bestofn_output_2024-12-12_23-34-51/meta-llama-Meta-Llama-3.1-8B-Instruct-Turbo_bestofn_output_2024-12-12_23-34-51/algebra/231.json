    "To find $A$ and $B$, we need to multiply both sides by the denominator of the right-hand side. This will eliminate the fractions.\n\nThe denominator on the right-hand side is $(x-10)(x+3) = x^2-7x-30$.\n\nSo, we multiply both sides by $x^2-7x-30$ to get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n5x + 2 &= A(x+3) + B(x-10)\\\\\n&= A x + 3A + B x - 10B.\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we want to match the coefficients of $x$ on both sides. The coefficient of $x$ on the left-hand side is $5$, and on the right-hand side, it's $A + B$.\n\nSo, we have:\n$$A + B = 5.$$\n\nNow, we want to match the constant terms on both sides. The constant term on the left-hand side is $2$, and on the right-hand side, it's $3A - 10B$.\n\nSo, we have:\n$$3A - 10B = 2.$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations in two variables:\n\n\\begin{align}\nA + B &= 5,\\\\\n3A - 10B &= 2.\n\\end{align}\n\nWe can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. If we multiply the first equation by $-3$, we get:\n\n\\begin{align}\n-3A - 3B &= -15.\n\\end{align}\n\nNow, we add this equation to the second equation:\n\n\\begin{align}\n(-3A - 3B) + (3A - 10B) &= -15 + 2\\\\\n-13B &= -13.\n\\end{align}\n\nNow, we solve for $B$:\n\n\\begin{align}\nB &= 1.\n\\end{align}\n\nNow that we have $B$, we can substitute it into the first equation to find $A$:\n\n\\begin{align}\nA + 1 &= 5\\\\\nA &= 4.\n\\end{align}\n\nTherefore, $A=4$ and $B=1$, so the solution is:\n\n$\\boxed{(4,1)}$",

    "To solve this problem, we will use partial fractions. The general form for partial fractions for this problem is:\n\n\\[\\frac{5x+2}{(x-10)(x+3)} = \\frac{A}{x-10} + \\frac{B}{x+3}\\]\n\nWe can eliminate the denominators by multiplying both sides of the equation by $(x-10)(x+3)$. This gives us:\n\n\\[5x + 2 = A(x+3) + B(x-10)\\]\n\nNow, we want to find $A$ and $B$ that satisfy the equation for all values of $x$. We can do this by equating coefficients.\n\nTo find $A$, we need to determine the value of the expression $A(x+3)$ when $x$ is equal to an unknown variable 'x'. Substituting $x = 10$ renders the term 'B' as zero. Hence,\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} 5(10)+2&= A(10+3)\\\\ 50+2 & = 13A \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad A&= \\frac{52}{13} = 4.00. \\end{aligned}\\]\n\nTo find $B$, we need to determine the value of the expression $B(x-10)$ when $x = -3$. Substituting $x=-3$ renders the term 'A' as zero. Hence,\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned} 5(-3) + 2 & = B(-3-10) \\\\ 5(-3) + 2 & = B(-13)\\\\ -15 + 2 & = -13B \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad B & = \\frac{-13}{-13} = 1.\\end{aligned}\\]\n\nThus, the values for $A$ and $B$ are $(4, 1)$.
