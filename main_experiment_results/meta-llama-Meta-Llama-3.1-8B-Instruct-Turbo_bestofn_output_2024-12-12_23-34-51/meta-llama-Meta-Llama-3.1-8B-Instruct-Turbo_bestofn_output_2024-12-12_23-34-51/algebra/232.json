    "To find the final amount of Jenna's bill, we need to apply the 1% late charge twice.\n\n1. First, we'll find the amount after the first late charge. \nThe original bill is $\\$400$. \nA 1% late charge on $\\$400$ is $0.01 * 400 = \\$4$.\nSo the bill after the first late charge is $400 + 4 = \\$404$.\n\n2. Next, we'll find the amount after the second late charge. \nAgain, a 1% late charge on $\\$404$ is $0.01 * 404 = \\$4.04$.\nSo the bill after the second late charge is $404 + 4.04 = \\$408.04$.\n\nTherefore, Jenna's final bill is $\\boxed{408.04}$.",
