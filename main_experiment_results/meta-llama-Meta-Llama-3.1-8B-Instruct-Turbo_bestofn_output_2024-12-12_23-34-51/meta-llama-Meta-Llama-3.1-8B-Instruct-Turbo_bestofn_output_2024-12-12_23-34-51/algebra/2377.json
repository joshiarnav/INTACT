    "To find the smallest positive value of $m$ so that the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ has integral solutions, we need to find two integers that multiply to give $420$ and add to give $m/10$.\n\nStep 1: Factorize $420$ into its prime factors.\nWe find that $420 = 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7$.\n\nStep 2: Find pairs of integers whose product is $420$.\nWe list the pairs:\n$(1, 420), (2, 210), (3, 140), (4, 105), (5, 84), (6, 70), (7, 60), (10, 42), (12, 35), (14, 30), (15, 28), (20, 21)$\n\nStep 3: Find a pair with a relatively small sum.\nHere, $(20, 21)$ has the smallest sum of $\\frac{41}{10}$ but we can do better as  that isn't a valid integer solution, we try another pair, (14,30) where $\\frac{m}{10} = 44$.\n\nStep 4: Determine the value of $\\frac{m}{10}$, from the previous pair, and multiply by $10$ to find the value of $m$.\n\nGiven that $\\frac{m}{10} = 44$, we multiply both sides by $10$ to get:\n$m = 44 * 10 = 440$.\n\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive value of $m$ so that the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ has integral solutions is:\n\n$\\boxed{440}$",

    "To find the smallest positive value of $m$ so that the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ has integral solutions, we can use the properties of quadratic equations. \n\nGiven the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the product of the roots is $c/a$ and the sum of the roots is $-b/a$. \n\nFor the given equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$, we have:\n- Product of the roots: $420/10 = 42$\n- Sum of the roots: $m/10$\n\nSince we are looking for integral solutions, both the product and sum of the roots must be integers.\n\nLet the roots of the equation be $r_1$ and $r_2$. \n\nWe can write the relationships between the roots and the coefficients of the equation as follows:\n\n- $r_1 \\times r_2 = 42$\n- $r_1 + r_2 = m/10$\n\nNow, we need to find the pairs of integers $(r_1, r_2)$ that satisfy the equation $r_1 \\times r_2 = 42$. \n\nThe pairs of integers that satisfy the equation are $(1, 42), (2, 21), (3, 14), (6, 7), (7, 6), (14, 3), (21, 2), (42, 1)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $m/10$ that correspond to the pairs of roots. \n\nSince the sum of the roots is equal to $m/10$, we have the following possibilities for $m/10$: $1 + 42 = 43$, $2 + 21 = 23$, $3 + 14 = 17$, $6 + 7 = 13$, $7 + 6 = 13$, $14 + 3 = 17$, $21 + 2 = 23$, $42 + 1 = 43$.\n\nThe unique values of $m/10$ are 17, 23, and 43.

  "critique": "Let's analyze each solution for correctness.\n\nSolution 1: This solution is mostly correct. It finds the pairs of integers whose product is 420 and then finds the pair with the smallest sum. However, the solution does not consider all possible pairs of integers whose product is 42. For example, it does not consider the pair (1, 42) and (42, 1) which have the same sum as the pair (20, 21). Therefore, the solution may not find the smallest possible value of m.\n\nSolution 2: This solution is mostly correct. It finds the pairs of integers whose product is 42 and then finds the pair with the smallest sum. However, it only considers the pairs (7, 6) and (6, 7) which have the same sum. It does not consider other pairs such as (1, 42) and (42, 1) which have the same sum. Therefore, the solution may not find the smallest possible value of m.\n\nSolution 3: This solution is correct. It finds all possible pairs of integers whose product is 42 and then finds the pair with the smallest sum. It considers all possible pairs and finds the smallest possible value of m.\n\nBased on the analysis, Solution 3 is the best solution.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 3",
  "solution": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the solutions the the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$. We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively, so $p+q = m/10$ and $pq = 420/10 = 42$. Since $m = 10(p+q)$, we minimize $m$ by minimizing the sum $p+q$. Since $p$ and $q$ are integers and multiply to 42, the possible values of $(p,q)$ are $(1,42),(2,21),(3,14),(6,7),(7,6),(14,3),(21,2),(42,1)$. (Note that if $p$ and $q$ are both negative, then $p+q$ is negative, so $m$ would be negative, which is excluded by the problem.) The sum $p+q$ is minimized when $(p,q) = (6,7)$ or $(7,6)$. In either case, $m = 10(p+q) = 10(6+7) = \\boxed{130}.$",
