    "To find the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double, let's denote the integer as 'x'. \n\nThe problem statement can be written as an equation:\nx^2 = 2x + 48\n\nWe need to isolate 'x'. To do that, we can rearrange the equation into a quadratic equation format:\nx^2 - 2x - 48 = 0\n\nWe can now solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 1, b = -2, and c = -48. \n\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a((-2)^2 - 4*1*(-48))) / 2*1\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a(4 + 192)) / 2\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a196) / 2\nx = (2 \u00b1 14) / 2\n\nNow, we have two solutions:\nx = (2 + 14) / 2 = 8\nx = (2 - 14) / 2 = -6\n\nSince we need the least integer, the correct answer is -6.\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{-6}$",
    "Let's denote the least integer as x. We need to find the least integer x that satisfies the equation x^2 = 2x + 48.\n\nFirst, we should rearrange the equation to get all terms on one side: x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0.\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation by factoring. We need to find two numbers whose product is -48 and whose sum is -2. \n\nAfter some trial and error, we can find that these numbers are -8 and 6, because their product is -48 and their sum is -2.\n\nUsing these numbers, we can rewrite the equation as (x - 8)(x + 6) = 0.\n\nTo find the solutions, we need to set each factor equal to zero and solve for x.\n\nSetting the first factor equal to zero, we get x - 8 = 0. Solving for x, we get x = 8.\n\nSetting the second factor equal to zero, we get x + 6 = 0. Solving for x, we get x = -6.\n\nHowever, we need to find the least integer. We already have a negative integer, so we don't need to do anything else.\n\nThe least integer whose square is 48 more than its double is $\\boxed{-6}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's denote the least integer as 'x'. We need to translate the given condition into an equation. The square of the integer is x^2, and its double is 2x. According to the problem, their difference is 48, so we can write an equation:\n\nx^2 - 2x = 48\n\nTo solve this equation, let's rearrange it into a standard quadratic equation form:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 48 = 0\n\nThis equation can be factored or solved using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is:\n\nx = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = -48. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [2 \u00b1 \u221a((-2)^2 - 4*1*(-48))] / (2*1)\nx = [2 \u00b1 \u221a(4 + 192)] / 2\nx = [2 \u00b1 \u221a196] / 2\nx = [2 \u00b1 14] / 2\n\nNow, let's find two possible values for x:\n\nx = [2 + 14] / 2 or x = [2 - 14] / 2\nx = 16 / 2 or x = -12 / 2\nx = 8 or x = -6\n\nThe problem asks for the least integer whose square satisfies the given condition. Since -6 is less than 8, the least integer satisfying the condition is -6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{-6}$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They arrive at the same answer, -6, using different methods. \n\nHowever, Solution 1 is the most straightforward and easiest to follow. It uses the quadratic formula directly, which is a standard method for solving quadratic equations. The other two solutions use factoring, which is also a valid method, but it requires more trial and error to find the correct factors.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "From the information given, we have $x^2 = 2x + 48$. Rearranging, we get $x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$, which we can factor as $(x+6)(x-8) = 0$. Therefore, $x = -6\\text{ or }8$.  Since we want the lesser, $\\boxed{-6}$ is our answer.",
