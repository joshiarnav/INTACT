    "To simplify $\\sqrt{28x} \\cdot \\sqrt{15x} \\cdot \\sqrt{21x}$, we will first express each term under the square root as a product of prime numbers and then use the properties of square roots.\n\nStep 1: Prime factorization of each term\n\n$\\sqrt{28x} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot x}$, \n$\\sqrt{15x} = \\sqrt{3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot x}$, \n$\\sqrt{21x} = \\sqrt{3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot x}$.\n\nStep 2: We can rewrite each square root as a product of square roots and non-square roots.\n\n$\\sqrt{2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot x} = 2 \\sqrt{7x}$,\n$\\sqrt{3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot x} = \\sqrt{15x}$,\n$\\sqrt{3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot x} = \\sqrt{21x}$.\n\nStep 3: Now we can multiply the simplified square roots.\n\n$\\sqrt{7x} \\cdot \\sqrt{15x} \\cdot \\sqrt{21x} = 2\\sqrt{7x} \\cdot \\sqrt{3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot x} \\cdot \\sqrt{3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot x}$.\n\nStep 4: Using the property that $\\sqrt{a}\\cdot\\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}$, we can write\n\n$2\\sqrt{7x} \\cdot \\sqrt{3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot x} \\cdot \\sqrt{3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot x} = 2 \\sqrt{7x \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot x \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot x}$.\n\nStep 5: Now, let's compute the product under the square root.\n\n$7x \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot x \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot x = 2^2 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot x^3$.\n\nStep 6: Now, let's use the property that $\\sqrt{a^2} = |a| = a$ for a positive number a, to rewrite the expression.\n\n$2 \\sqrt{2^2 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot x^3} = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{5 \\cdot x^3}$.\n\nStep 7: Now, let's simplify the expression inside the square root.\n\n$\\sqrt{5 \\cdot x^3} = x \\sqrt{5x}$.\n\nStep 8: Now, let's multiply the simplified expression.\n\n$2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 3 \\cdot x \\sqrt{5x} = 84x \\sqrt{5x}$.\n\nTherefore, the simplified form is $\\boxed{84x\\sqrt{5x}}$.",

In our case, we can take the square root of 2^4, which is 2^2. We can take the square root of 3^3 which is 3^1.5 or 3 * sqrt(3). However, we can only take the square root if the exponent is even, if it's not if the value under the square root must remain as if the exponent was even to maintain the final product if taking square roots of other factors in the product if they had odd exponents. Hence the square root if the product remains the same. Here if we take the square root of x^3 we get sqrt(x^3) = x * sqrt(x), to maintain the value of the product."
