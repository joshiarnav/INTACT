  "problem": "Joann rode her bike at an average speed of 12 miles per hour for three and a half hours. If her friend, Fran, rides for 3 hours, at what average speed, in miles per hour, would she have to ride her bike to travel the same distance that Joann traveled?",

    "To find the distance Joann traveled, we need to multiply her speed by the time she traveled:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time\nDistance = 12 miles/hour * 3.5 hours\nDistance = 42 miles\n\nSince Fran wants to travel the same distance (42 miles) in 3 hours, we need to find her speed:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nSpeed = 42 miles / 3 hours\nSpeed = 14 miles/hour\n\nSo, Fran would have to ride her bike at an average speed of 14 miles per hour to travel the same distance as Joann.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{14}$.",
    "To find the distance traveled by Joann, we use the formula distance = speed * time. \n\nSince Joann's speed is 12 miles per hour and the time is 3.5 hours, we have:\ndistance = 12 * 3.5 \ndistance = 42 miles\n\nNow, we know that Fran needs to travel the same distance in 3 hours. We need to find Fran's required speed. We use the formula speed = distance / time.\n\nWe plug in the values:\nspeed = 42 / 3\nspeed = 14 miles per hour\n\nSo, Fran needs to ride her bike at an average speed of 14 miles per hour to travel the same distance that Joann traveled.\n\n$\\boxed{14}$",
    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the distance traveled by Joann. \n   We know that speed * time = distance.\n   Given that Joann rides at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 3.5 hours, \n   we can calculate her distance as:\n   distance = speed * time\n   distance = 12 * 3.5\n   distance = 42 miles\n\n2. Now that we know the distance traveled by Joann (42 miles), we need to find the speed at which Fran needs to ride to travel the same distance in 3 hours.\n\n   We can use the same formula: speed * time = distance.\n   We know the distance (42 miles) and Fran's time (3 hours), so we need to solve for speed.\n   speed = distance / time\n   speed = 42 miles / 3 hours\n   speed = 14 miles per hour\n\nTherefore, Fran would have to ride her bike at an average speed of 14 miles per hour to travel the same distance that Joann traveled.\n\n$\\boxed{14}$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are mathematically correct. They all arrive at the same answer, which is that Fran needs to ride her bike at an average speed of 14 miles per hour to travel the same distance that Joann traveled.\n\nHowever, I would select Solution 3 as the best solution because it is the most detailed and step-by-step approach. It clearly outlines the two steps needed to solve the problem: calculating the distance traveled by Joann and then finding the speed at which Fran needs to ride to travel the same distance.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 3. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 3",
  "solution": "In $3\\frac{1}{2}$ hours, Joann covers $\\left(3\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ hours}\\right)(12\\text{ mph})=42$ miles.  If Fran's average speed in miles per hour is $s$, then Fran covers $3s$ miles in $3$ hours.  Solving $3s=42$ we find $s=\\boxed{14}$ miles per hour.",
