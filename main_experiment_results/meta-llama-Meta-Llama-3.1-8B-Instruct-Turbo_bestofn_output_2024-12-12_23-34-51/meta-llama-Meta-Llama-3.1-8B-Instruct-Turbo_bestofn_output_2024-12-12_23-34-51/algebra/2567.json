    "To find the constant $t$, we need to expand the left-hand side of the equation using the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method) and then equate it with the right-hand side.\n\nFirst, expand the left-hand side:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(5x^2 - 6x + 7)(4x^2 +tx + 10) & = (5x^2)(4x^2) + (5x^2)(tx) + (5x^2)(10) + (-6x)(4x^2) + (-6x)(tx) + (-6x)(10) + (7)(4x^2) + (7)(tx) + (7)(10) \\\\\n& = 20x^4 + 5tx^3 + 50x^2 -24x^3 -6tx^2 -60x + 28x^2 + 7tx + 70\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n20x^4 + 5tx^3 + 50x^2 -24x^3 -6tx^2 -60x + 28x^2 + 7tx + 70 & = 20x^4 + (5t - 24)x^3 + (50 - 6t + 28)x^2 + (7t - 60)x + 70\n\\end{align*}\n\nNext, equate the coefficients of like terms on both sides of the equation:\n\n* For $x^4$: We have $20x^4$ on both sides, so this equation is true for all values of $x$.\n* For $x^3$: We have $(5t - 24)x^3$ on the left-hand side and $-54x^3$ on the right-hand side. Equating the coefficients, we get: $5t - 24 = -54$.\n* For $x^2$, $x$, and the constant term, we can ignore them for now because we only need to find the value of $t$.\n\nNow, solve for $t$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n5t - 24 & = -54 \\\\\n5t & = -54 + 24 \\\\\n5t & = -30 \\\\\nt & = -30/5 \\\\\nt & = -6\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo, the constant $t$ is $\\boxed{-6}$.",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. However, Solution 1 is the most detailed and provides step-by-step explanations for each part of the process.

  "solution": "We look at the coefficient of $x$ in the expansion of the product on the left. We get an $x$ term when we multiply $(+7)(+tx)$ and when we multiply $(-6x)(+10)$ in the expansion.  So, on the left the $x$ term is $7tx -60x$. Since this term must equal $-102x$, we have $7tx -60x = -102x$, so $t = \\boxed{-6}$.\n\nWe can check our answer (and check that it is indeed possible to find a solution to this problem) by multiplying out the left when $t=-6$: \\begin{align*} &(5x^2-6x+7)(4x^2-6x+10)\\\\\n&\\qquad= 5x^2(4x^2-6x+10) -6x(4x^2-6x+10) \\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad+ 7(4x^2-6x+10)\\\\ &\\qquad=20x^4 -54x^3 +114x^2 -102x +70. \\end{align*}This matches the polynomial given in the problem, so our answer is correct.",
