    "To find the value of $a$, we need to express $4x^2 + 14x + a$ as the square of a binomial. \n\nA perfect square trinomial can be written in the form of $(ax + b)^2$.\n\nLet's start by expanding $(2x + b)^2$, because $4x^2$ is the square of $2x$. We get:\n\\[(2x + b)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2(2x)b + b^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2\\]\n\nOur goal is to make the expression $4x^2 + 14x + a$ match the expanded form above.\n\nWe see that the middle term of the expanded form is $4bx$. To make this match the middle term in the given expression, $14x$, we set $4b = 14$, and solve for $b$. \n\nDividing both sides by $4$ gives:\n\\[b = \\frac{14}{4} = \\frac{7}{2}\\]\n\nNow, we have $b = \\frac{7}{2}$, and we used this to make the middle term match the given expression. \n\nTo make the constant term match, we use the value of $b$ to find $b^2$ and set it equal to $a$:\n\\[b^2 = \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{49}{4}\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{49}{4}}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Recognize the form of a perfect square trinomial:**\n   A perfect square trinomial can be written in the form $(ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2.$\n\n   In the given problem, we have $4x^2 + 14x + a$ as the square of a binomial. \n\n2. **Compare the given expression with the general form of the square of a binomial:**\n   We can see that $a^2 = 4$ (the coefficient of $x^2$). Thus, $a = \\pm 2.$ We'll consider both cases to see which one results in the correct value of $a$ for the expression.\n\n   - Case 1: $a = -2$\n   - Case 2: $a = 2$\n\n3. **Consider Case 1: $a = -2$:**\n   Using $a = -2,$ we have $4x^2 + 2(-2)b x + b^2 = 4x^2 - 4bx + b^2.$ We want this to be equal to $4x^2 + 14x + a.$ This means that $-4bx = 14x.$ Since we want this to hold true for all values of $x$, we must have $-4b = 14$ and $a = -2.$ Solving for $b$, we get $b = -\\frac{7}{2}.$ Then, $b^2 = \\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{49}{4}.$ However, in the given problem, the constant term $a$ should not have a dependency on the square root of anything, since that is an $ab$ within the original perfect square. Looking at the possible forms $(\\pm 2x + b)^2 = 4x^2 \\pm 4bx + b^2,$ $b^2$ is the constant we are looking for, and we have found it to be  $\\frac{49}{4}$ for $a=-2.$ \n\n4. **Consider Case 2: $a = 2$:**\n   Using $a = 2,$ we have $4x^2 + 2(2)b x + b^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2.$ We want this to be equal to $4x^2 + 14x + a.$ This means that $4bx = 14x.$ Since we want this to hold true for all values of $x$, we must have $4b = 14$ and $a = 2.$ Solving for $b$, we get $b = \\frac{7}{2}.$ Then, $b^2 = \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{49}{4}.$ Looking at the possible forms $(\\pm 2x + b)^2 = 4x^2 \\pm 4bx + b^2,$ the constant we are looking for $b^2$ is $\\frac{49}{4}$ when $a = 2.$\n\n5. **Identify the value of a:**\n   In both cases, the value of $b^2$ (or $a$) is $\\frac{49}{4}$ is incorrect in the case of $a$ not being equal to $\\boxed{\\frac{49}{4}}$ within the problem,  as it is the square of  b. To actually solve the problem find $b$ when $a^2 = 4  to be 2 since $a^2 = 4, $ $a = \\pm 2 .$ This $ 2$ is the number  outside the binomial,  $(\\pm 2x + b)$  which, when  squared will yield the $4x^2$ found within the original problem. Looking  at possible forms, the  $(\\pm 2x + b)^2 = 4x^2 \\pm 4bx + b^2,   b^2  is what we are looking for when the  $a = \\pm2   is squared and an $x$ term is added $ 2bx$ within  the  $ \\pm 4bx$. We now  need to address what  $2bx$ becomes $14x .$ To do that, find  $ 2b  to be  $ 14/2 =7,$ which simplifies to  $ b=  7/2  for $ a= \\pm2 $  which is  used to solve for $b$  in this case of squaring then  get the result of $ 4x^2  + 14x + a $.\n\nLooking at $(\\pm 2x + b)^2 = 4x^2 \\pm 4bx + b^2,$ to find the $b$  in front  of the term  $x$, use   $\\pm2b$ which should be equal to 14. Since 14 can be achieved by $2b$ when that is $7$, $ 2b= 14 $ $b=  7 .$ $ $b $  squared $ b^2 = $ $7\\cdot  7  $ $ 49 $ when $ $a = \\pm 2.  So $ 49 $  is our $ $boxed{answer}",

  "solution": "If $4x^2 + 14x + a$  is the square of a binomial, then the binomial has the form $2x +b$ for some number $b$, because $(2x)^2 = 4x^2$.  So, we compare $(2x+b)^2$ to $4x^2 + 14x + a$. Expanding $(2x+b)^2$ gives \\[(2x+b)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2(2x)(b) + b^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2.\\] Equating the linear term of this to the linear term of $4x^2+14x+a$, we have $4bx=14x$, so $b=\\frac{14}{4}=\\frac{7}{2}$. Squaring the binomial gives $\\left(2x+\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2=4x^2+14x+\\frac{49}{4}$. Therefore, $a=\\boxed{\\frac{49}{4}}$.",
