    "To find the first term of a geometric sequence, we need to know the common ratio and the third term. We are given the third and fourth terms.\n\n1. Identify the common ratio (r) by dividing the fourth term by the third term:\n   r = 4th term / 3rd term\n   r = 16 / 12\n   r = 4/3\n\n2. Once we have the common ratio, we can find the middle term (second term) by multiplying the third term with the reciprocal of the common ratio:\n   second term = 3rd term / r\n   second term = 12 / (4/3)\n   second term = 12 * 3 / 4\n   second term = 9\n\n3. Now that we have the second term, we can find the first term by multiplying the second term with the reciprocal of the common ratio:\n   first term = 2nd term / r\n   first term = 9 / (4/3)\n   first term = 9 * 3 / 4\n   first term = 27/4\n\nSo, the first term of the sequence is $\\boxed{27/4}$.",
    "To find the first term of the geometric sequence, we need to understand the properties of a geometric sequence. \n\nIn a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio (r). \n\nGiven that the third term (t3) is 12 and the fourth term (t4) is 16, we can write:\n\nt3 = t1 * r^2\nt4 = t1 * r^3\n\nWe are given that t3 = 12 and t4 = 16. \n\nNow we can set up an equation to find the common ratio r. \n\nWe have: 16 = 12 * r\n\nDividing both sides by 12 gives us: r = 16 / 12 = 4 / 3\n\nNow that we have the common ratio, we can find the first term of the sequence (t1). \n\nWe know that:\nt3 = t1 * r^2\n12 = t1 * (4/3)^2\n\nSubstituting (4/3)^2, we get: \n12 = t1 * (16/9)\n\nTo find t1, we multiply both sides by 9/16:\nt1 = 12 * (9/16) = 27/4\n\nTherefore, the first term of the sequence is $\\boxed{27/4}$. \n\nThis is the correct answer when written with the boxes.",
    "To find the first term of the geometric sequence, we can use the information given about the third and fourth terms. \n\nLet 'a' be the first term of the sequence and 'r' be the common ratio. \n\nThe nth term of a geometric sequence is given by: an = a * r^(n-1)\n\nGiven that the third term (a3) is 12 and the fourth term (a4) is 16, we can write:\na3 = a * r^(3-1) = a * r^2 = 12\na4 = a * r^(4-1) = a * r^3 = 16\n\nNow, we can find the common ratio by dividing the fourth and third terms:\nr = a4 / a3\n= 16 / 12\n= 4/3\n\nNow that we have the common ratio 'r', we can substitute it back into either of the expressions for a3 or a4 and solve for 'a'. We'll use the equation for a3:\na * r^2 = 12\nSubstituting r = 4/3, we get:\na * (4/3)^2 = 12\na * 16/9 = 12\nMultiplying both sides by 9, we get:\n16a = 108\n\nDividing both sides by 16, we get:\na = 108/16\na = 27/4\n\nTherefore, the first term of the sequence is:\n$\\boxed{27/4}$"

  "solution": "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence. Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$. Solving, we have $a\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",
