    "To find the value of c, we need to consider the behavior of the quadratic expression on the given interval. \n\nSince the expression is a quadratic, it is continuous and differentiable everywhere, so we can use the following approach:\n\n1. **Find the critical points**: The expression x * (3x + 1) can be rewritten as 3x^2 + x. The critical points occur when the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. In this case, the derivative of 3x^2 + x is 6x + 1, which is a linear function and never undefined.\n\n   To find the critical point, we set 6x + 1 = 0:\n   6x + 1 = 0\n   6x = -1\n   x = -1/6\n\nTherefore, the only critical point is x = -1/6.\n\n2. **Check the endpoints of the interval**: We are given the interval (-7/3, 2). The endpoints of the interval are x = -7/3 and x = 2.\n\n   We can plug these values into the expression 3x^2 + x to find the corresponding y-values:\n   At x = -7/3:\n   3(-7/3)^2 + (-7/3)\n   3(49/9) - 7/3\n   49/3 - 7/3\n   42/3\n   14\n\n   At x = 2:\n   3(2)^2 + 2\n   12 + 2\n   14\n\n   We can see that at x = -7/3 and x = 2, the quadratic expression has the same value, which is 14.\n\n3. **Determine the maximum value of the function on the interval**: Since the critical point is x = -1/6, we can check whether this is a local maximum or minimum. However, we know that a quadratic function is a parabola, and since the coefficient of x^2 is positive, this parabola opens upwards. Therefore, the critical point x = -1/6 is a local minimum.\n\n   Since the quadratic function is continuous on the interval (-7/3, 2), and is a local minimum at x = -1/6, we can use this point to determine the maximum value of the function on the interval.\n\n   By checking the function values at the endpoints and critical point, we can conclude that the maximum value of the function occurs when x = -1/6, but we have to exclude this point from our definition of c since the interval starts at x = -7/3, however this isn't needed as both x = -7/3 and x = 2 give a value greater than the function is for any point x in (-7/3,2) . As the function x * (3x+1) at x = -7/3 gives the value of 14 which is what the function gives at both endpoints, so we can safely conclude that c, or the function value at the endpoints must be the answer to this question.",

    "To find the value of $c$, we need to consider the given inequality $x\\cdot(3x+1)<c$, which holds true if and only if $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$.\n\nFirst, let's find the critical values by analyzing the inequality.
