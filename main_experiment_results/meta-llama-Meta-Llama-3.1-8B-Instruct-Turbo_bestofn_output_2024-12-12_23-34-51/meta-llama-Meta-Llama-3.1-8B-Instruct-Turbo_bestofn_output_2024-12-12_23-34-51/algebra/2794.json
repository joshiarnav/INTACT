    "To evaluate $\\log_82$, we can start by asking the question \"to what power must 8 be raised to obtain 2\".\n\nLet's denote the answer as $x$, so we have:\n$8^x = 2$\n\nWe can rewrite 8 as $2^3$, so we have:\n$(2^3)^x = 2$\n\nUsing the exponent law $(a^b)^c = a^{b \\cdot c}$, we can simplify this expression:\n$2^{3x} = 2$\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n$3x = 1$\n\nNow, we can solve for $x$:\n$x = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nTherefore, $\\log_82 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

    "To evaluate $\\log_82$, we need to find the power to which the base 8 must be raised to obtain the number 2.\n\nRecall that logarithms are the inverses of exponentials. One way to solve this problem is to rewrite the logarithmic expression in an exponential form.\n\nWe are solving for $x$ in the following equation: \n\\[ 8^x = 2 \\]\n\nIn order to find a solution, let's recall other powers of 8 to identify which power results in 2. \n\nNotice that $8^0=1$, $8^1=8$, and $8^2=64$. The next power is $8^3$ and that is equal to 512, which is still larger than 2.\n\nNotice a better approach: to evaluate $8^x=2$ essentially, we could think of 8 as $2^3$. Then, we will calculate for $x$: $ (2^3)^x =2  $, applying the property of a power raised to another power \n$\\Rightarrow 2^{3x} = 2$. \n\nSince the bases are the same (which are 2), \n$3x=1$\n $\\Rightarrow x=1/3$\n\nIn the format given, the solution would be:\n$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They arrive at the same answer, $\\frac{1}{3}$, through slightly different approaches. \n\nHowever, I would consider Solution 1 as the best solution. It is concise, clear, and directly addresses the problem. The steps are well-structured, and the use of the exponent law is properly applied.",
