    "To find the coordinates of point $F$, we need to determine the equations of the lines passing through points $A$ and $E$, as well as points $C$ and $D$. \n\nFirst, let's find the coordinates of point $E$, which is the midpoint of line segment $\\overline{BC}$.

Therefore, the coordinates of $E$ are $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(8+0),\\frac{1}{2}(0+0)\\right) = (4, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the equations of the lines passing through points $A$ and $E$, as well as points $C$ and $D$.\n\nThe equation of the line passing through points $A(0, 6)$ and $E(4, 0)$ can be found using the slope-intercept form, which is given by $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the y-intercept. \n\nTo find the slope $m$, we can use the formula:\n\n$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n$m = \\frac{0 - 6}{4 - 0} = \\frac{-6}{4} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\n\nSince the line passes through point $A(0, 6)$, the y-intercept is $6$.

Therefore, the equation of the line passing through points $C$ and $D$ is:\n\n$y = -\\frac{3}{8}x + 3$\n\nSince the line passes through two points, we can solve for the intersection of the two lines. \n\nTo do this, we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $x$.\n\n$-\\frac{3}{2}x + 6 = -\\frac{3}{8}x + 3$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $8$ to eliminate the fractions, we get:\n\n$-24x + 48 = -3x + 24$\n\nSubtracting $-3x$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$-21x + 48 = 24$\n\nSubtracting $48$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$-21x = -24$\n\nDividing both sides by $-21$, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{-24}{-21} = \\frac{8}{7}$\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate, we can plug it back into either of the two equations to find the y-coordinate.\n\nUsing the equation $2y = -3x + 12$ and plugging in $x = \\frac{8}{7}$, we get:\n\n$2y = -3 \\cdot \\frac{8}{7} + 12$\n\n$2y = \\frac{-24}{7} + 12$\n\n$2y = \\frac{-24 + 84}{7}$\n\n$2y = \\frac{60}{7}$\n\nDividing both sides by $2$, we get:\n\n$y = \\frac{60}{14} = \\frac{30}{7}$\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of point $F$ are $\\left(\\frac{8}{7}, \\frac{30}{7}\\right)$.\n\nThe sum of the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of point $F$ is $\\frac{8}{7} + \\frac{30}{7} = \\frac{38}{7}$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{38}{7}}$."
