    "To simplify $5(3-i)+3i(5-i)$, we'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction).\n\nStep 1: Distribute the terms inside the parentheses.\n- $5(3-i)$ means multiplying 5 by 3 and then multiplying 5 by $-i$.\n- $3i(5-i)$ means multiplying $3i$ by 5 and then multiplying $3i$ by $-i$.\n\nStep 2: Multiply the terms inside the previous step.\n- $5(3-i)$ becomes $15-5i$.\n- $3i(5-i)$ becomes $15i-3i^2$.\n\nStep 3: Replace $i^2$ with $-1$, because $i$ squared equals $-1$.\n- $15i-3i^2$ becomes $15i-3(-1)$.\n- The equation then is $15i+3$.\n\nStep 4: Combine the simplified terms from step 2 and step 3.\n- We have $15-5i+15i+3$.\n\nStep 5: Combine like terms.\n- The $-5i$ and $15i$ are like terms and can be combined.\n- $15-5i+15i+3$ becomes $15+3+10i$.\n- This is $18+10i$.\n\nSo, the final simplified answer is $\\boxed{18+10i}$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They all arrive at the same simplified expression: $18 + 10i$. \n\nHowever, Solution 1 is the most straightforward and easy to follow. It clearly breaks down the steps and explains each one, making it a good choice for someone who is new to complex numbers or algebra.",
