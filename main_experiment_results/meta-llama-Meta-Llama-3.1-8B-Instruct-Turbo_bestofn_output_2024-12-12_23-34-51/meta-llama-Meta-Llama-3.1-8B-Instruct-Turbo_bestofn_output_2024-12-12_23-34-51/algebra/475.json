    "To find the greatest integer $x$ such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime, we should first factorize the given quadratic expression.\n\nThe given expression can be rewritten as $|6x^2-47x+15| = |(2x-15)(3x-1)|.$ \n\nFor the absolute value of a product to be prime, either the absolute value of one of the factors must be prime or the other factor must equal 1 or -1. \n\nIf $(2x-15) = 1$, then $x=8$. \nIf $(2x-15) = -1$, then $x=7$. \nIf $(3x-1) = 1$, then $x=\\frac{2}{3}$. \nIf $(3x-1) = -1$, then $x=0$. \n\nSince we're looking for integer values of x, we can ignore the fractional value x=\\frac{2}{3}. \n\nWe have several candidates for the greatest x: 0, 7, and 8.\n\nTo find the greatest x for which |6x^2-47x+15| is prime, we also need to check these candidates to see if their values make |6x^2-47x+15| prime.\n\nFor x = 0, |6*0^2-47*0+15| = 15, which is not prime.\n\nFor x = 7, |6*7^2-47*7+15| = 102, which is not prime.\n\nFor x = 8, |6*8^2-47*8+15| = 37, which is prime.\n\nTherefore, the greatest integer x such that |6x^2-47x+15| is prime is x = 8.\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
    "To find the greatest integer $x$ such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime, we'll break down the problem into steps.\n\n### Step 1: Factorize the Given Quadratic Expression\nWe'll start by factorizing the quadratic expression $6x^2-47x+15$. \n\nAfter factorizing, we get: \n$6x^2-47x+15=(2x-15)(3x-1)$ \n\n### Step 2: Express the Given Expression in Terms of Factors\nNow, we can express the given expression $|6x^2-47x+15|$ in terms of its factors: \n\n$|6x^2-47x+15|=|(2x-15)(3x-1)|$\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Factors for Prime Numbers\nFor the expression to be a prime, one of the factors must be equal to $\\pm1$. \n\nLet's consider the first factor $2x-15$. For this factor to be equal to $\\pm 1$, we'll calculate the corresponding values of x:\n\n-   For the case, when the factor equals $1$, we have $2x-15=1$. \n    Solving for x, we get: $x = 8$. \n\n-   For the case, when the factor equals $-1$, we have $2x-15=-1$. \n    Solving for x, we get: $x = 7$. \n\nNow, we must consider the second factor $3x-1$.

    "To find the greatest integer $x$ such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime, we can first factorize the given quadratic expression. \n\nFactorizing $6x^2-47x+15$:\n\nWe can start by trying to factorize this expression. However, since this doesn't easily factorize, we may need to use the quadratic formula.\n\nBut let's examine this expression. \n\nThe given expression $6x^2-47x+15$ can be rewritten as $6x^2-45x-2x+15$. This can also be written as $3x(2x-15)-1(2x-15)$. \n\nSimplifying, we get $(3x-1)(2x-15)$. \n\nHowever, look at the problem. We need the absolute value of this expression to be prime. Thus $|6x^2-47x+15|=|(3x-1)(2x-15)|$ must be prime.\n\nTo ensure that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime, we want either $3x-1$ or $2x-15$ to be equal to $1$, in case of positive 1 or -1, and for the absolute value then taken (which was ruled out), or equal to the negative of 1. However, if $2x-15$ is the one equalling to the negative of 1 then we end up with an imaginary number and $|6x^2-47x+15|$ will not be an integer in case of negative 1. So that's ruled out.\n\nNow, let's examine if $3x-1=1$. This gives $3x-1 =1 \\implies 3x=1+1 \\implies 3x=2 \\implies x=\\frac{2}{3}$. Given x must be an integer, x isn't equal to $\\frac{2}{3}$. \n\nNow let's consider if $2x-15=1$. This gives $2x-15=1 \\implies 2x=1+15 \\implies 2x=16 \\implies x=8$. We found this value of $x$ and in order to verify that the value $x=8$ really does give a prime number when $|6x^2-47x+15|=|(3x-1)(2x-15)|=|1*17|=|17|=17$ is substituted in expression $|6x^2-47x+15|$, we can check and do so below to verify that 17 (a prime number) is equal to $|6x^2-47x+15|$ when $x=8$. \n\nBefore we verify if $x=8$ really does give $|6x^2-47x+15|=17$, let's find other valid integer solutions for $x$.\n\nNext, let's consider the case when $3x-1=-1$ is true. If the case is true, then we have $3x-1=-1 \\implies 3x=1-1 \\implies 3x=0 \\implies x=0$. We verified if the $x=0$ really does result in  $|6x^2-47x+15|$ being equal to a prime number below and it seems that our $x=0$ really does give a non-prime number. We also verified that the value $3x-1=-1 \\implies 3x=1-1 \\implies 3x=0 \\implies x=0$ in case of negative 1 doesn't give the prime. We found the solution and solutions to verify $3x-1=-1 \\implies 3x=1-1 \\implies 3x=0 \\implies x=0$.\n\nLastly, let's consider the case when $2x-15=-1$ is true. If the case is true, then we have $2x-15=-1 \\implies 2x=15-1 \\implies 2x=14 \\implies x=\\frac{14}{2}$. Given that x must be integer, we know that $x=\\frac{14}{2}$ doesn't give the desired prime solution and isn't equal to any integer and we also know $2x-15=-1 \\implies 2x=15-1 \\implies 2x=14 \\implies x=\\frac{14}{2}=\\frac{7}{1}$ isn't equal to an integer.\n\nTherefore, the valid values of x such that $x=8$ or $x=0$.\n\nTo further ensure the result we get from $x=0$, we need to verify if $|6x^2-47x+15|=|0|$. If we substitute $x=0$, we get...\n\nWe can substitute the value $x=0$ into $|6x^2-47x+15|$. The expression after $x=0$ is substituted is $|0|$. Since $|0|$ isn't a prime, we can eliminate $x=0$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest integer that works such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime is $\\boxed{8}$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest value we get such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime is $\\boxed{8}$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{8}$"

  "solution": "We can factor the quadratic $6x^2-47x+15$ as $(2x-15)(3x-1)$. So we have $|6x^2-47x+15|=|(2x-15)(3x-1)|=|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|$. In order for $|6x^2-47x+15|$ to be prime, its only divisors must be $1$ and itself. Thus one of $|2x-15|$ or $|3x-1|$ must be equal to $1$.\n\nIf $|3x-1|=1$, then $3x-1=1$ or $3x-1=-1$. These equations yield $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $x=0$, respectively. We throw out $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ since it is not an integer, and keep $x=0$ as a candidate.\n\nIf $|2x-15|=1$, then $2x-15=1$, in which case $2x=16$ and $x=8$, or $2x-15=-1$, in which case $2x=14$ and $x=7$.\n\nThus our candidates for the greatest $x$ are $0, 7$, and $8$.

Thus $\\boxed{8}$ is the largest integer for which $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime.",
