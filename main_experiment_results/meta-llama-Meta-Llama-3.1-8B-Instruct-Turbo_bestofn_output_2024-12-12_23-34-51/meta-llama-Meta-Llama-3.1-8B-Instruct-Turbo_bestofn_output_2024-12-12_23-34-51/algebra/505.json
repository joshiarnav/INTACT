    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the graph of the function $y=p(x)$.\n\nGiven that we are looking for $p(1.5)$ and the graph shows that $p(1)=4$ and $p(2)=4$.\n\nLooking at the function $p(1)=4$, it seems that the function has some sort of relationship with the points $(1, 4)$ and $(2, 4)$ given that $p(2)=4$. Moreover, since the function $p(x)$ seems to be connected to the function as: $f1(x) = sgn(2x-2) \\times \\abs{2x-2}^{1/3} + 2 \\times sgn(2x-2) \\times \\abs{2x-2}^{1/5} + \\abs{2x-2}^{1/7}$.\n\nHowever, to find $p(1.5)$ we need to find a function that satisfies both points $(1, 4)$ and $(2, 4)$ because if we look at both points we see that the form for $f1(x)$, will be given as: $\\abs{2x - 2}^{1/3}$ as the form for $(x-1)$ and that there is no $y$ value that fits between points $(1,4)$ and $(2,4)$ on the graph, in terms of (1/7) because $\\abs{2 \\times 1.5 - 2}^{1/7}$ cannot equal a $y$ value that sits between $4$ and $2$ \n\nAs we look at the function $\\abs{2x - 2}^{1/3}$ we realize that it cannot be the function we're looking for since it's given that there is a $y$ value between points $(1,4)$ and $(2,4)$ that sits at $1.5$. So we must look at another form for the $y$ value. This is a bit more challenging, so we look at the function that fits the form of $h_1(x) = 4$ and $h_2(x) = 2$. So here, we can simply use $y=x$ and use $\\abs{2x - 2}^{1/n}$ since this is the only other way to get a value of the function that matches the conditions given. This gives us $p(1.5)=\\abs{1.5c - 2}^{1/7}$ and if we solve for c, we get $c=\\frac{1.5}{1.5} =1$, and so $\\abs{ \\frac{3}{2}  - 2}^{1/7}$\n\nSo now we just need to calculate this:\n\n\\[\np(1.5) =  \\begin{cases}\n \\abs{ (1.5) - 2 }^{1/7} \\\\\n \\implies \\ \\abs{ \\frac{3}{2} - 2 }^{1/7}  \\\\\n \\implies \\ \\abs{  - \\frac{1}{2}  }^{1/7} \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\\[ \\implies p(1.5) =  \\abs{  - \\frac{1}{2}  }^{1/7} \\]\n\nUsing properties of exponents and absolute value:\n\n\\[ \\abs{ - \\frac{1}{2} }^{1/7}  =  \\abs{  - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{1/7} }^{1} \\]\n\n\\[ \\implies p(1.5) = \\left|  - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{1/7} \\right|^{1/7}  \\]\n\nTo proceed, let's evaluate the term inside the absolute value first:\n\n\\[  - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{1/7}  \\]\n\nIn general, the number inside the absolute value is non-negative. (Note that the function in this problem is not explicitly defined to be non-negative, so for simplicity, we will assume that the condition of non-negativity holds.) Therefore we have:\n\n$$ p(1.5) = \\left( \\left(  - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{1/7} \\right)^{1/7} \\right)  $$\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n$$ p(1.5) =    \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{1/7 \\times 1/7} $$\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n$$ p(1.5) =  \\left(  \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{1/49} $$\n\nBecause $(\\frac{1}{2})^{1/n}$ will always be close to the number 1 for any positive value of n, we see that $(\\frac{1}{2})^\\frac{1}{49}$ is very close to 1. (As long as n is greater than 1, (1/2)^(1/n) will always be less than 1 and almost indistinguishable from 1.)\n\nTherefore,  $(\\frac{1}{2})^{1/49}  \\approx  1$\n\nUsing properties of exponents we know that  $    1^{1+1}   \\implies \\ 1^1 \\times 1^1$\n\nSo we have:\n\n$$ p(1.5) =  \\boxed{1} $$ that is essentially the number $1$"
