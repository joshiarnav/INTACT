    "To find the smallest possible value for $x + y$, we can start by simplifying the given equation $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{18}$.\n\nFirst, let's multiply both sides of the equation by $18xy$ to eliminate the denominators:\n\\[18y + 18x = xy\\]\n\nNow, let's rearrange this equation to express it as a quadratic equation in terms of $x$:\n\\[xy - 18x - 18y = 0\\]\n\nNext, we can add $324$ to both sides of the equation to complete the square:\n\\[xy - 18x - 18y + 324 = 324\\]\n\\[(x - 18)(y - 18) = 324\\]\n\nNow, let's factor $324$ into its prime factors:\n\\[324 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^4\\]\n\nSince we're looking for the smallest possible value of $x + y$, we should try to find two factors of $324$ that are as close as possible. \n\nThe two closest factors of $324$ are $12$ and $27$, since $12 \\cdot 27 = 324$ and they are as close as possible. Now, let's find the corresponding values of $x$ and $y$ by solving for them using the factored equation:\n\\[(x - 18)(y - 18) = 324\\]\n\nSince $(x - 18) = 12$ and $(y - 18) = 27$, substituting both into the factored equation yields the values of $x$ and $y$. \n\nHowever, in our factoring the closest possible values of our previous values are $(12,27)$ which when added to 18 will give $30$ and $45$ as $x$ and $y$, respectively. Note that  $30$ and $45$ are the smallest values of $x$ and $y$ possible that are greater than or equal to $18$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value for $x + y$ is $30 + 45 = 75$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{75}$.",

    "To solve this problem, we should start by manipulating the given equation to find a relationship between x and y.\n\nThe given equation is:\n\\[\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{18}\\]\n\nTo simplify this, let's multiply both sides by $x \\cdot y \\cdot 18$. \n\nThis results in:\n\\[\\frac{x\\cdot y\\cdot 18}{x\\cdot y} + \\frac{x\\cdot y \\cdot 18}{y\\cdot x} = \\frac{x \\cdot y\\cdot 18}{18}\\]\n\nSimplifying the denominators, we get:\n\\[18y + 18x = xy\\]\n\nNow, we want to express this in a form such that we can find the minimum value of $x + y$.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n\\[xy - 18x - 18y = 0\\]\n\nNow, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick (which involves adding a value to both sides that makes the left side easily factorable), by adding 324 to both sides:\n\\[xy - 18x - 18y + 324 = 324\\]\n\nNow we can factor this as:\n\\[(x-18)(y-18) = 324\\]\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, the numbers $(x-18)$ and $(y-18)$ must also be integers. \n\nTo find the values of $x$ and $y$ that make $x-18$ and $y-18$ as close as possible, we should find the pairs of positive integer factors of 324.\n\nPairs of positive integer factors of 324 are: (1, 324), (2, 162), (3, 108), (4, 81), (6, 54), (9, 36), and (12, 27).\n\nHowever, when we try to add 18 to each pair, we obtain the pairs (19, 342), (20, 180), (21, 126), (22, 99), (24, 72), (27, 54), and (30, 45).\n\nSo, we must find the smallest sum of the numbers in these pairs. \n\nPairs ordered from smallest to greatest sum of pair numbers are: (30, 45), (24, 72), (22, 99), (21, 126), (20, 180), (19, 342), (27, 54).\n\nSo we should find the sum for each pair.
