    "To find the sum of all values of $k$ such that the equation $2x^2-kx+8=0$ has two distinct integer solutions, we need to use Vieta's formulas.\n\nVieta's formulas state that for a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ with roots $r$ and $s$, the sum of the roots is given by $r + s = -\\frac{b}{a}$ and the product of the roots is given by $rs = \\frac{c}{a}$.\n\nIn this case, the quadratic equation is $2x^2-kx+8=0$, so we have $a = 2$, $b = -k$, and $c = 8$. \n\nThe sum of the roots is $r + s = -\\frac{-k}{2} = \\frac{k}{2}$. Since the roots are distinct integer solutions, their sum must be an integer.\n\nThe product of the roots is $rs = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$. Since the roots are distinct integers and their product is 4, the possible pairs of roots are (1, 4) and (-1, -4).\n\nNow, we can find the possible values of $k$ by substituting each pair of roots into the formula for the sum of the roots.\n\nIf the roots are (1, 4), then their sum is $r + s = 1 + 4 = 5$. Substituting this into the formula for the sum of the roots, we get $\\frac{k}{2} = 5 \\implies k = 10$.\n\nIf the roots are (-1, -4), then their sum is $r + s = -1 - 4 = -5$. Substituting this into the formula for the sum of the roots, we get $\\frac{k}{2} = -5 \\implies k = -10$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of $k$ is $10 + (-10) = \\boxed{0}$.",

    "To solve this problem, we'll use Vieta's formulas, which provide a relationship between the coefficients of a polynomial and its roots. For a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$ with roots $r$ and $s$, Vieta's formulas state that:\n\n- $r+s=-\\frac{b}{a}$ (the sum of the roots)\n- $rs=\\frac{c}{a}$ (the product of the roots)\n\nGiven the equation $2x^2-kx+8=0$, we want to find the values of $k$ for which the roots are integer and distinct.\n\nUsing Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots is $-\\frac{-k}{2} = \\frac{k}{2}$ and the product of the roots is $\\frac{8}{2}=4$. \n\nSince the roots are distinct integers, we can list the possible pairs of distinct integers whose product is $4$. These pairs are: $(1, 4)$ and $(-1, -4)$, $(2, 2)$, $(-2, -2)$. But notice that these pairs don't have integer sums unless they are the pairs $(1, 4)$ and $(-1, -4)$. Therefore, our roots must be either $r=1$ and $s=4$, or $r=-1$ and $s=-4$.\n\nThus, the sum of our roots must be 5 or -5. They must equal  $\\frac{k}{2}$ in both instances.\n\nThis implies that the possible values of $\\frac{k}{2}$ are 5 and -5.\n\nMultiplying to find $k$ gives 10 and -10 as our possible values.\n\nWe can check these values to see if they actually satisfy the equation.\n\nWe will plug in the value $k=10$ into the quadratic equation and see if the solutions are integers. Then we will do the same for $k=-10$.\n\n Substituting $k=10$ yields the equation $2x^2-10x+8=0$. Rearranging this equation gives $2x^2-8x-2x+8=0$. Factoring gives $2x(x-4)-2(x-4)=0$ or $(x-4)(2x-2)=0$. Lastly, factoring it again gives $(x-4)(2x-1)=0$. This equation has solutions $x=4$ and $x=\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, it does not satisfy the conditions we have set.\n\nPlugging in $k=-10$ yields the equation $2x^2+10x+8=0$. Rearranging this equation gives $2x^2+8x+2x+8=0$. Factoring gives $2x(x+4)+(x+4)=0$ or $(2x+1)(x+4)=0$. Lastly, factoring it again gives $(2x+1)(x+4)=0$. This equation has solutions $x=-\\frac{1}{2}$ and $x=-4$. Therefore, it does not satisfy the conditions we have set.\n\nNow, we should to go back and notice what we did wrong. According to Vieta's formulas the product is 4, and the sums of our roots must be $\\frac{k}{2}$. If we notice we wrote the pairs of distinct integers before were (2, 2), (-2, -2) but they do not have integer sums because 2 + 2 = 4. So, the only pairs of distinct integers whose product is 4 are (1, 4) and (-1, -4).\n\nLooking at these pairs we notice (1, 4) is the pair of distinct integers whose product is 4 and sum is 5. \n\nThus, the sum of the roots must be 5. Therefore, $\\frac{k}{2}=5$. This implies that the possible value of $k$ is 10.\n\nWe can check this value to see if it actually satisfies the equation.\n\nSubstituting $k=10$ in the given equation yields  $2x^2-10x+8=0$. Substituting $k =-10$ in the given equation yields  $2x^2+10x+8=0$. Using the discriminant from the quadratic formula, we can eliminate either answer.\n\nThe discriminant is  $b^2-4ac$.\nPlugging the $k =10$ in gives  $(-10)^2-4(2)(8)$.\nPlugging the $k =-10$ in gives  $(10)^2-4(2)(8)$.\nLooking at both answers and determine that they are equal. Therefore, both answers are equal and our possible values of $k$ is  $\\boxed{10}$ and $\\boxed{-10}$.\nSumming our results together yields $\\boxed{0}$."

  "critique": "Let's analyze each solution for correctness:\n\nSolution 1: The solution is mostly correct, but it incorrectly concludes that the sum of all possible values of k is 0.

However, in this problem, both values of k are possible, so the correct answer is indeed 0.\n\nSolution 2: The solution is mostly correct, but it incorrectly concludes that the sum of all possible values of k is 30. The correct sum is 25 + (-10) + 25 + (-10) = 30, but this is incorrect because the value 25 is not a possible value of k.

The correct sum is 10 + (-10) = 0, but this is a special case where only one value of k is possible. However, in this problem, both values of k are possible, so the correct answer is indeed 0. But the solution also incorrectly states that the values of k are 10 and -10, when in fact, both values are possible.\n\nHowever, the most accurate solution is Solution 2, because it correctly lists all the possible pairs of roots and calculates the corresponding values of k. The only mistake is in the final calculation of the sum of all possible values of k.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is 2.",
  "solution": "We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively. Let the two roots of the equation be $p$ and $q$. Then $p+q=k/2$. However the only other restriction on $p$ and $q$ is that $pq = 4$ and that $p$ and $q$ are distinct integers. For each such possibility $(p,q)$, we also have the possibility $(-p,-q)$ since $(-p)(-q) = pq = 4$. This gives two values of $k$: $k=2(p+q)$ and $k=2(-p-q)$. Since these occur in such pairs, the sum of all possible values of $k$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nAlternatively, one can note that the only way to factor 4 into 2 distinct integer factors is $4\\cdot1$ and $(-4)(-1)$, so that the two possible values of $k$ are $10$ and $-10$, given a sum of $0$.",
