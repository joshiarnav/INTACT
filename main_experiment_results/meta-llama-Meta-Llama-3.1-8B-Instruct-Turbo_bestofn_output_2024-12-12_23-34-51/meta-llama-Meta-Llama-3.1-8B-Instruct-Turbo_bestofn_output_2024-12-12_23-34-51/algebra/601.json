    "To find the points where the two parabolas intersect, we need to solve the system of equations.\n\nFirst, let's equate the two equations:\n\n$3x^2+4x-5 = x^2+11$\n\nSubtracting $x^2+11$ from both sides gives:\n\n$2x^2+4x-16 = 0$\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation. Factoring seems difficult, so we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn this case, $a=2$, $b=4$, and $c=-16$. Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\n$x = \\frac{-4\\pm\\sqrt{4^2-4(2)(-16)}}{2(2)}$\n\nSimplifying the expression under the square root gives:\n\n$x = \\frac{-4\\pm\\sqrt{16+128}}{4}$\n\n$x = \\frac{-4\\pm\\sqrt{144}}{4}$\n\n$x = \\frac{-4\\pm 12}{4}$\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions for $x$:\n\n$x_1 = \\frac{-4 +12}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2$\n\n$x_2 = \\frac{-4 - 12}{4} = \\frac{-16}{4} = -4$\n\nTo find the corresponding $y$-coordinates, we plug these $x$-values into either of the original equations. Let's use $y = 3x^2 + 4x - 5$:\n\nFor $x = 2$:\n\n$y = 3(2)^2 + 4(2) - 5 = 3(4) + 8 - 5 = 12 + 8 - 5 = 15$\n\nFor $x = -4$:\n\n$y = 3(-4)^2 + 4(-4) - 5 = 3(16) - 16 - 5 = 48 - 21 = 27$\n\nSo, the points where the two parabolas intersect are $(2, 15)$ and $(-4, 27)$.\n\nHowever, the order of increasing $x$-coordinate is required. $-4$ is less than $2$, so the points need to be ordered in that respect.\n\nThe intersection points are (-4,27);(2,15).",
    "To find the points of intersection, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x. \n\nFirst, let's set the two equations equal to each other:\n$3x^2+4x-5 = x^2+11$\n\nNext, let's move all terms to one side of the equation:\n$3x^2-x^2+4x-5-11 = 0$\n$2x^2+4x-16 = 0$\n\nNow, let's add 16 to both sides:\n$2x^2+4x = 16$\n\nNext, we can divide both sides by 2:\n$x^2+2x = 8$\n\nNow, let's complete the square:\n$x^2+2x+1 = 8 + 1$\n$(x+1)^2 = 9$\n\nFinally, let's take the square root of both sides:\n$x+1 = \\pm3$\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n$x = -1\\pm3$\n$x = 2$ or $x = -4$\n\nNow, that we have our x values, we can substitute them back into the equation to find our y values. \n\nLet's start with x = 2:\n$y = 3(2)^2+4(2)-5$\n$y = 3(4)+8-5$\n$y = 12+8-5$\n$y = 15$\n\nNow, that we have x = 2 and y = 15, we can create our first point:\n(2,15)\n\nLet's substitute x = -4 into the equation:\n$y = 3(-4)^2+4(-4)-5$\n$y = 3(16)-16-5$\n$y = 48-16-5$\n$y = 27$\n\nNow, that we have x = -4 and y = 27, we can create our second point:\n(-4,27)\n\nNow that we have both points, we can list them in order of increasing x-coordinate:\n$(-4,27);(2,15)$\n\nOur final answer is: $\\boxed{(-4,27);(2,15)}$",

  "solution": "Setting the right-hand sides of the given equations equal gives $3x^2+4x-5=x^2+11$. Combining like terms gives $2x^2+4x=16$. Dividing by $2$ gives $x^2+2x=8$, and rearranging gives $x^2 +2x - 8=0$.  Factoring gives $(x+4)(x-2)=0$, so our solutions are $x=-4$ and $x=2$.
