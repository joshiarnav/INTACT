    "To find the vertex of the parabola described by the equation $y=-3x^2-30x-81$, we can use the method of completing the square or directly use the vertex formula. Since we are asked for the y-coordinate of the vertex, it is easier to use the vertex formula.\n\nThe vertex formula is given by $x=-b/2y$ (for a parabola in the form $y=x^2+bx+c$), but in this case, our equation is not in vertex form. However, we can still use the formula by rewriting it. \n\nFirst, we need to convert the given equation to standard form by dividing the whole equation by -3.\n\n$$y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81$$\n$$\\frac{y}{-3} = \\frac{-3x^2}{-3} - \\frac{30x}{-3} - \\frac{81}{-3}$$\n$$y/(-3) = x^2 + 10x + 27$$\n\nNote that the parabola's leading coefficient here is positive (but -3 in original equation), but we still have the standard form.\n\nSince the equation is now in the form $y=x^2+bx+c$, we can directly use the x-coordinate of the vertex, $-b/2a$. In our equation, $a=1$ and $b=10$.\n\n$$x = -\\frac{10}{2(1)}$$\n$$x = -\\frac{10}{2}$$\n$$x = -5$$\n\nSince we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can plug this value into the original equation to get the y-coordinate, which is the value of $n$. \n\nSubstituting $x = -5$ into the original equation:\n\n$$y = -3(-5)^2 - 30(-5) - 81$$\n$$y = -3(25) + 150 - 81$$\n$$y = -75 + 150 - 81$$\n$$y = 150 - 156$$\n$$y = -6$$\n\nSo the y-coordinate of the vertex, $n$, is $\\boxed{-6}$."

  "critique": "Solution 1 is correct. \n\nSolution 2 is also correct but it uses the method of completing the square, which is an alternative approach. \n\nSolution 3 contains an error in the vertex formula. The correct formula is $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$ for a parabola in the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$. The formula $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$ is for a parabola in the form $x^2+bx+c$, but Solution 3 has it in the form $y=x^2+bx+c$. It then proceeded to divide the whole equation by -3, which is correct, but incorrectly stated the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex. \n\nHowever, the error in the formula does not affect the final answer since the x-coordinate of the vertex is correctly calculated as $-5$. \n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "We will complete the square on the given quadratic expression to find the vertex. Factoring $-3$ from the first two terms, we have \\[y=-3(x^2+10x)-81\\]In order to make the expression inside the parentheses a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(10/2)^2=25$ inside the parentheses. Doing this, we get \\[y=-3(x^2+10x+25-25)-81 = -3(x+5)^2-6\\]The graph of an equation of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ is a parabola with vertex at $(h,k)$, so the vertex of our parabola is at $(-5,-6)$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{-6}$.",
