First, we add 20 to both sides of the equation to get:\n\n$xy+5x+4y+20=15$\n\nNow the equation can be factored as:\n\n$(x+4)(y+5)=15$\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are integers, we need to find the pairs of integers that multiply to 15. The pairs are: (1, 15), (-1, -15), (3, 5), and (-3, -5).\n\nNow we have four cases based on the factors of 15:\n\nCase 1: $(x+4)=1$ and $(y+5)=15$  \nThis implies that $(x,y)=(-3,20)$.\n\nCase 2: $(x+4)=-1$ and $(y+5)=-15$  \nThis implies that $(x,y)=-7,-20$.\n\nCase 3: $(x+4)=3$ and $(y+5)=5$  \nThis implies that $(x,y)=-1,0$.\n\nCase 4: $(x+4)=-3$ and $(y+5)=-5$  \nThis implies that $(x,y)=-7,-10$.\n\nWe need to find the greatest possible value of $y$, which is 20 in Case 1. \n\n$\\boxed{20}$",

    "To find the greatest possible value of $y$, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick to factor the given equation. \n\nFirst, we add 20 to both sides of the equation to get:\n\n\\[xy + 5x + 4y + 20 = 15\\]\n\nNow, we can factor the left-hand side of the equation:\n\n\\[(x + 4)(y + 5) = 15\\]\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x + 4$ and $y + 5$ must also be integers, and the only factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. \n\nWe need to consider all the possible pairs of these factors, which are (1, 15), (3, 5), and their reversals. However, since we want the greatest possible value of $y$, we need to find the pair with the largest value for $y + 5$. \n\nIn this case, the pair (1, 15) is not applicable because it does not satisfy the equation when considering the order of the factors in the reverse pair solution which will provide the greater y + 5.\n\nUsing the pairs, we can set up two equations:\n\n1. $(x + 4) = 1$ and $(y + 5) = 15$ \n2. $(x + 4) = 3$ and $(y + 5) = 5$\n\nSolving these two pairs of equations gives:\n\n1. $(x + 4) = 1$ and $(y + 5) = 15$ -> $(x, y) = (-3, 10)$\n2. $(x + 4) = 3$ and $(y + 5) = 5$ -> $(x, y) = (-1, 0)$\n\nAs we can see, the greatest possible value of $y$ is 10. \n\nSo, the answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
