    "To find the time it takes Jordan to run 5 miles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the time it takes Jordan to run 2 miles: \n   It took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles, and Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles. \n   Half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles = 24 / 2 = 12 minutes.\n\n2. Find Jordan's rate (pace) in miles per minute:\n   Distance covered by Jordan = 2 miles\n   Time taken by Jordan = 12 minutes\n   Rate = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 12 minutes = 1/6 miles per minute.\n\n3. Calculate the time it takes Jordan to run 5 miles at the same rate:\n   Distance to be covered by Jordan = 5 miles\n   Rate = 1/6 miles per minute\n   Time = Distance / Rate = 5 miles / (1/6 miles per minute) = 5 * 6 = 30 minutes.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{30}$ minutes.",
    "To find the time it takes Jordan to run 5 miles, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we know it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles. We need to find out how long it takes Steve to run 1 mile. We can do this by dividing the total time by the total distance:\n\n   Steve's time per mile = 24 minutes / 3 miles = 8 minutes/mile\n\n2. Since Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles, we need to find half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles:\n\n   Jordan's time for 2 miles = (24 minutes / 2) = 12 minutes\n\n3. Now, we need to find Jordan's rate per mile. We can do this by dividing the total time by the total distance:\n\n   Jordan's time per mile = 12 minutes / 2 miles = 6 minutes/mile\n\n4. Finally, we can find the time it takes Jordan to run 5 miles by multiplying the rate per mile by the total distance:\n\n   Jordan's time for 5 miles = 6 minutes/mile * 5 miles = 30 minutes\n\nSo, the answer is: $\\boxed{30}$",
    "To find out how much time it takes Jordan to run 5 miles, we need to find out how long it takes Jordan to run 1 mile.\n\n1. Since Steve runs 3 miles in 24 minutes and we know that Jordan runs 2 miles in half the time it takes Steve to run 3 miles, we calculate how long it takes Jordan to run 2 miles:\n   Time for Steve to run 3 miles = 24 minutes\n   Time for Jordan to run 2 miles = 24 / 2 = 12 minutes\n\n2. Since Jordan runs 2 miles in 12 minutes, we need to find out how long it takes Jordan to run 1 mile:\n   Time for Jordan to run 2 miles = 12 minutes\n   Time for Jordan to run 1 mile = 12 / 2 = 6 minutes\n\n3. Now that we have the time it takes Jordan to run 1 mile and we know we want to find out the time for 5 miles, we multiply:\n   Time for Jordan to run 1 mile = 6 minutes\n   Time for Jordan to run 5 miles = 6 * 5 = 30 minutes\n\nSo, the time it takes Jordan to run 5 miles is 30 minutes, in the format $\\boxed{30}$."

  "solution": "Since Steve's 3-mile time is 24 minutes, Jordan ran 2 miles in $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot24=12$ minutes.  Therefore, each mile takes Jordan 6 minutes to run, so he would take $6\\cdot5=\\boxed{30}$ minutes to run five miles.",
