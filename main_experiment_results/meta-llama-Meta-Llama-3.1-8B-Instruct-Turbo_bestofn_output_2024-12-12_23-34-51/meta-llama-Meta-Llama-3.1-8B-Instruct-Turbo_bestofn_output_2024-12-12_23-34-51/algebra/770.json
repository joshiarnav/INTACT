    "To ensure that no two friends receive the same number of coins, we need to give 1 coin to the first friend, 2 coins to the second friend, 3 coins to the third friend, and so on. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1.\n\nThe total number of coins given to the friends can be calculated using the formula:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2\n\nwhere n is the number of friends.\n\nIn this case, n is 12. So, the total number of coins given to the friends is:\n\n12(12 + 1)/2 = 12 * 13 / 2 = 156 / 2 = 78\n\nHowever, Alex only has 63 coins. To find the minimum number of additional coins he needs, we subtract the number of coins he has from the total number of coins required:\n\nAdditional coins needed = Total coins required - Coins available\n= 78 - 63\n= 15\n\nSo, Alex needs at least $\\boxed{15}$ more coins to give each friend at least one coin and no two friends receive the same number of coins.",
    "To find the minimum number of additional coins Alex needs, let's consider the situation step by step.\n\n1. Alex has 12 friends and wants to distribute the coins so that each friend gets at least one and a unique number of coins. \n\n2. The least he can give to the first friend is 1 coin, the second friend is 2 coins, the third friend is 3 coins, and so on until the 12th friend.\n\n3. The total number of coins he needs can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \n   Sum = (n * (a1 + an)) / 2 \n   where, \n   n is the number of items in the series (number of friends in this case),\n   a1 is the first term of the series (1 coin for the first friend),\n   an is the last term of the series (12 coins for the 12th friend).\n\n4. Plugging the values into the formula: \n   Sum = (12 * (1 + 12)) / 2\n   Sum = (12 * 13) / 2\n   Sum = 156 / 2\n   Sum = 78\n\n5. Alex already has 63 coins, so to find out how many more coins he needs, we subtract 63 from 78:\n   Additional coins = 78 - 63\n   Additional coins = 15\n\nTherefore, Alex needs $\\boxed{15}$ additional coins to distribute them uniquely among his 12 friends.",
    "Let's break this problem down step by step:\n\n1. Alex wants to give each of his 12 friends at least one coin and make sure no two friends receive the same number of coins. This means he can give 1 coin to the first friend, 2 coins to the second friend, 3 coins to the third friend, and so on, until the 12th friend.\n\n2. If we list the coins he can give out in order, it would be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.\n\n3. To find the total number of coins he needs to give out in this order, we can add up the numbers from 1 to 12. This can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \n    \\[ n(n+1)/2\\]\n    where n is the number of terms (in this case, 12).\n\n    \\[ 12(12 + 1)/2 = 12 * 13 / 2 = 156 / 2  = 76\\]\n\n4. However, Alex only has 63 coins and needs a total of 76 coins to give out in this order. So, he needs 76 - 63 = 13 more coins.\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{13}$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct in their approach to finding the minimum number of additional coins Alex needs to give each friend at least one coin and no two friends receive the same number of coins.\n\nHowever, there's a slight discrepancy in the final answer. \n\nSolution 1 and Solution 2 both calculate the total number of coins required as 78, and then subtract 63 to get 15.\n\nSolution 3, on the other hand, calculates the total number of coins required as 76, and then subtracts 63 to get 13.\n\nBut, let's re-examine the calculation for the sum of the arithmetic series in Solution 3: \n\n\\[ 12(12 + 1)/2 = 12 * 13 / 2 = 156 / 2  = 78\\]\n\nThis is the same result obtained in Solution 1 and Solution 2. Therefore, the correct total number of coins required is indeed 78.\n\nSo, the correct calculation for the additional coins needed is:\n\nAdditional coins = 78 - 63\n= 15\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1.",
  "solution": "Alex wants to minimize the number of coins he gives to his friends without giving any two of them the same number of coins. The minimum number of coins he can give to a friend is 1. He then gives 2 coins to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 12. The total number of coins Alex has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+12 = \\frac{12 \\cdot 13}{2}=78$.  Thus, Alex needs $78-63=\\boxed{15}$ more coins.",
