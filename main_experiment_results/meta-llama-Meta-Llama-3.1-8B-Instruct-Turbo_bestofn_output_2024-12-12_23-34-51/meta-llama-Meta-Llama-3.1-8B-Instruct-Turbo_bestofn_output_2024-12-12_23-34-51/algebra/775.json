    "To find the smallest real number $x$ in the domain of $f(f(x))$, we need to find the smallest real number $x$ for which $f(f(x))$ is defined.\n\nStep 1: Find the domain of the outer function $f(x)=\\sqrt{x-3}$.\nThe domain of a square root function is non-negative real values. So we have $x-3 \\geq 0 \\implies x \\geq 3$.\n\nStep 2: Substitute $f(x)$ as $f(f(x))= \\sqrt{f(x)-3} = \\sqrt{\\sqrt{x-3}-3}$.\nFor $f(f(x))$ to be defined, $\\sqrt{x-3}-3 \\geq 0$ because the argument of a square root must be non-negative.\nNow, let's solve for $x$ from the inequality $\\sqrt{x-3}-3 \\geq 0$.\nStep 3: Solve for $x$ from the inequality $\\sqrt{x-3}-3 \\geq 0$.\n$\\sqrt{x-3}-3 \\geq 0 \\implies \\sqrt{x-3} \\geq 3$.\nNow square both sides: $(\\sqrt{x-3})^2 \\geq 3^2 \\implies x-3 \\geq 9$.\nFinally, add 3 to both sides: $x-3+3 \\geq 9+3 \\implies x \\geq 12$.\n\nSo the smallest real number $x$ in the domain of $f(f(x))$ is $x=12$.",
    "To find the smallest real number $x$ in the domain of $f(f(x))$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we need to find $f(x)$. Given that $f(x) = \\sqrt{x-3}$, we can use this expression as the input for $f(f(x))$.\n\n2. The next step is to find $f(f(x))$. We can plug in the expression for $f(x)$ into the function $f(x)$, so we have: \n$f(f(x))=f(\\sqrt{x-3})$\n\n3. Plug in the expression for $f(x)$ into the function. For $f(\\sqrt{x-3})$, using the original function definition, we can plug in $\\sqrt{x-3}$:\n$f(x)=\\sqrt{\\sqrt{x-3}-3}$\n\n4. We must ensure the value of $\\sqrt{x-3}-3$ is greater than or equal to 0 for the expression $f(x)=\\sqrt{\\sqrt{x-3}-3}$ to have a solution.\n\n5. Setting $\\sqrt{x-3}-3 \\geq 0$, we have: \n$\\sqrt{x-3} \\geq 3$\n\n6. To proceed, we isolate the variable by squaring both sides of the inequality:\n$(\\sqrt{x-3})^2 \\geq 3^2$\n\n7. The expression becomes: \n$x-3 \\geq 9$\n\n8. Solve the inequality by adding 3 to both sides: \n$x \\geq 12$\n\n9.

    "To find the smallest real number $x$ in the domain of $f(f(x))$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the expression for $f(f(x))$. \n\nWe know that $f(x)=\\sqrt{x-3}$. Plugging this into $f(f(x))$, we get:\n$f(f(x))=f(\\sqrt{x-3})=\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{x-3})-3}$.\n\nHowever, this doesn't make sense since you cannot have a negative value under a square root. Thus we need to ensure the inner $\\sqrt {x-3} $ is  >= 3.\nSo we only need to ensure that $\\sqrt{x-3} \\ge 3$. Squaring both sides, we get $x-3 \\ge 9$. Solving for x, we get $x \\ge 12$.\n\n2. Now we need to ensure the outer square root only has a positive value. $\\sqrt{x-3} - 3  >= 0$.\nSolving this equation, we get $x-3  >= 3$. Solving for x, we get $x  >= 6$.\n\nCombining the two inequalities, we get that $x \\ge 12$. For $x \\ge 12$, we can see that $f(f(x)) = \\sqrt{x-3} - 3 \\ge 0$. Thus the smallest real number x in the domain of f(f(x)) is $x = \\boxed{12}$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They all arrive at the same conclusion that the smallest real number $x$ in the domain of $f(f(x))$ is $x=12$.\n\nHowever, Solution 1 is the most straightforward and easiest to follow. It clearly explains the steps needed to find the domain of $f(f(x))$ and avoids unnecessary complexity.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "Note that $f(x)$ is defined if and only if $x\\ge 3$.\n\nThus $f(f(x)) = f(\\sqrt{x-3})$ is defined if and only if $$\\sqrt{x-3}\\ge 3.$$ This is true if and only if $$x-3\\ge 3^2,$$ or equivalently, if $x\\ge 12$.
