  "problem": "Anton has two species of ants, Species A and Species B, in his ant farm. The two species are identical in appearance, but Anton knows that every day, there are twice as many ants of Species A than before, while there are three times as many ants of Species B.

    "Let's denote the initial number of ants of Species A as A and the initial number of ants of Species B as B. On Day 0, we know that A + B = 30.\n\nSince the number of Species A ants doubles every day, after 5 days, the number of Species A ants will be 2^5A = 32A.\n\nSimilarly, the number of Species B ants triples every day, so after 5 days, the number of Species B ants will be 3^5B = 243B.\n\nOn Day 5, the total number of ants is 3281, so we can write the equation: 32A + 243B = 3281.\n\nNow, we have two equations: \nA + B = 30\n32A + 243B = 3281\n\nWe can solve the first equation for A: \nA = 30 - B\n\nSubstitute this expression for A into the second equation: \n32(30 - B) + 243B = 3281\n\nExpand and simplify: \n960 - 32B + 243B = 3281\n\nCombine like terms: \n211B = 2321\n\nDivide both sides by 211: \nB = 11\n\nNow that we know B, we can find A: \nA = 30 - B = 30 - 11 = 19\n\nFinally, to find the number of ants of Species A on Day 5, we multiply A by 2^5: \nNumber of ants of Species A = 32A = 32 * 19 = 608.\n\nSo the answer is: $\\boxed{608}$",
    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Let's say the number of ants of Species A on Day 0 is x, and the number of ants of Species B on Day 0 is y. We know that x + y = 30.\n\nStep 2: Since the number of ants of Species A doubles every day, after 5 days, the number of ants of Species A will be 2^5x = 32x.\n\nStep 3: Similarly, since the number of ants of Species B triples every day, after 5 days, the number of ants of Species B will be 3^5y = 243y.\n\nStep 4: We know that on Day 5, the total number of ants is 3281. So, we can set up the equation 32x + 243y = 3281.\n\nStep 5: Now we have two equations: x + y = 30 and 32x + 243y = 3281. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y.\n\nStep 6: First, let's multiply the first equation by 32 to match the coefficient of x in the second equation: 32x + 32y = 960.\n\nStep 7: Now we can subtract the equation from Step 6 from the equation in Step 4 to eliminate x: (32x + 243y) - (32x + 32y) = 3281 - 960, which simplifies to 211y = 2321.\n\nStep 8: Divide both sides by 211 to find y: y = 2321 / 211 = 11.\n\nStep 9: Now that we know y = 11, we can substitute this value back into the equation x + y = 30 to find x: x + 11 = 30, so x = 30 - 11 = 19.\n\nStep 10: Now that we know x = 19, we can find the number of ants of Species A on Day 5: 32x = 32 * 19 = 608.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{608}$",
    "We can start by setting up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of ants of Species A on Day 0 as 'a' and the number of ants of Species B on Day 0 as 'b'.\n\nWe know that the total number of ants on Day 0 is 30, so we can set up our first equation:\n\na + b = 30\n\nWe are also given that the number of ants of Species A doubles every day, and the number of ants of Species B triples every day. Therefore, if there are 'n' ants of Species A on Day 0, there will be 2^5 = 32 ants of Species A on Day 5, and if there are 'm' ants of Species B on Day 0, there will be 3^5 = 243 ants of Species B on Day 5.\n\nOn Day 5, the total number of ants is 3281. So, we can set up another equation:\n\n32a + 243b = 3281\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\n1) a + b = 30\n2) 32a + 243b = 3281\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. We will use the elimination method here.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 32 to make the coefficients of 'a' in both equations equal:\n\n32a + 32b = 960\n\nNow we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate 'a':\n\n(32a + 243b) - (32a + 32b) = 3281 - 960\n211b = 2321\n\nNow we can divide both sides by 211:\n\nb = 11\n\nNow we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find 'a':\n\na + 11 = 30\na = 19\n\nTherefore, there are 19 ants of Species A on Day 0. Now, we can find the number of ants of Species A on Day 5:\n\nNumber of ants of Species A on Day 5 = 32a = 32 * 19 = 608\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{608}$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct.

  "solution": "Suppose that there are $a$ ants of Species A and $b$ ants of Species B on Day 0. We thus have that $a+b=30$. Notice that on Day 1, there will be $2a$ ants of Species A, on Day 2, there will be $2(2a) = 4a$ ants of Species A, and on Day 3, there will be $2(4a)=8a$ ants of Species A, etc. Following this line of reasoning, on Day 5, there will be $2^5a$ ants of Species A and $3^5b$ ants of Species B, meaning that $32a+243b=3281$. We now solve this system of linear equations. We have that $32a+32b=960$, so \\begin{align*}(32a+243b)-(32a+32b) &= 211b \\\\\n&= 3281-960 \\\\\n&= 2321.\\end{align*}We then have $b = \\frac{2321}{211} = 11$. This means that $a=30-11=19$, and there are $32\\cdot 19 = \\boxed{608}$ ants of Species A on Day 5.",
