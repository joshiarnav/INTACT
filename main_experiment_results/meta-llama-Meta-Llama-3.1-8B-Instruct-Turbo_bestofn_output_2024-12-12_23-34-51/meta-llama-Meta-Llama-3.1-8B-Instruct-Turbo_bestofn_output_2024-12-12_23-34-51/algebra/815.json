    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Given information**: The product of two positive integers plus their sum is 103, and they are relatively prime (i.e., they have no common factors other than 1).\n\n2. **Formula representation**: Let's denote the two positive integers as x and y. From the given information, we can write the equation as xy + x + y = 103.\n\n3. **Using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick**: We can use a common technique to factor the equation by adding 1 to both sides of the equation: xy + x + y + 1 = 104. This equation can be factored using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick: (x + 1)(y + 1) = 104.\n\n4. **Finding the pairs of factors**: We need to find the pairs of factors of 104 that are less than 21 (since x and y are less than 20). \n\nThe pairs of factors of 104 are: \n(1, 104), (2, 52), (4, 26), (8, 13).\n\n5. **Considering relatively prime numbers**: Since x and y are relatively prime, the pairs we consider should also not have a common factor other than 1. In this case, we find that (x, y) can be either (7, 12) or (8, does not satisfy the relatively prime condition) neither the second nor any other option that equals 8, therefore leaving us only with (7, 12).\n\n6. **Finding the sum of x and y**: Now that we have the two possible pairs, we can find the sum of x and y: 7 + 12 = 19.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{19}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: We are given that the product of two positive integers plus their sum is 103.

    "Let's denote the two positive integers as x and y. According to the problem, we have the following equation:\n\nxy + x + y = 103\n\nSince x and y are relatively prime, their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n\nxy + x + y + 1 = 104\n\nBy adding 1 to both sides, we can see that the left-hand side of the equation is in the form of (x + 1)(y + 1).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n(x + 1)(y + 1) = 104\n\nNow, let's find the factors of 104. The factors are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 26, 52, and 104.\n\nSince x and y are less than 20, we need to consider the following pairs of factors:\n\n(x + 1, y + 1) = (13, 8) or (8, 13) or (26, 4) or (4, 26) or (52, 2) or (2, 52)\n\nNow we can solve for x and y:\n\n1. (x, y) = (12, 7)\n2. (x, y) = (7, 12)\n3. (x, y) = (25, 3)\n4. (x, y) = (3, 25)\n5. We can eliminate (52, 2) and (2, 52) since one of the numbers is greater than 20.\n6.

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They arrive at the same answer, which is 19. However, I will analyze each solution for clarity, conciseness, and adherence to mathematical principles.\n\nSolution 1 is clear and easy to follow.

  "solution": "Let our numbers be $a$ and $b$ with $a>b.$ Then $ab+a+b=103$. With Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick in mind, we add $1$ to both sides and get $ab+a+b+1 = 104$, which factors as $(a+1)(b+1)=104$. We consider pairs $(a+1, b+1)$ of factors of $104$: $(104,1), (52,2), (26,4), (13,8)$. Since $a<20$, we can rule out the first 3 pairs, which gives $a=12$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\\boxed{19}$.",
