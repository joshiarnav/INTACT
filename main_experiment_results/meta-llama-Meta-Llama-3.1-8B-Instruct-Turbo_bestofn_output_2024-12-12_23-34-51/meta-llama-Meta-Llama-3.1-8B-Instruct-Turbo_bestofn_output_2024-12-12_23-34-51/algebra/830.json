    "To determine the area of the rectangle at Stage 6, we need to consider the dimensions and the pattern of the added squares.\n\nAt Stage 1, we have a single $3'' \\times 3''$ square, so the area is $9$ square inches.\n\nAt Stage 2, another $3'' \\times 3''$ square is added to the right of the initial square. This means that the length of the rectangle is now $3 + 3 = 6$ inches, and the width is still $3$ inches. The area at Stage 2 is $(6)(3) = 18$ square inches.\n\nAt Stage 3, another $3'' \\times 3''$ square is added to the right of the existing squares. This means that the length of the rectangle is now $6 + 3 = 9$ inches, and the width is still $3$ inches. The area at Stage 3 is $(9)(3) = 27$ square inches.\n\nFrom the above pattern, we see that at each stage, the length of the rectangle is increased by $3$ inches, and the width remains the same. \n\nBy Stage 6, we will have added $5$ more squares of $3'' \\times 3''$ each. Therefore, the length of the rectangle will be $3 + (5 \\times 3) = 18$ inches, and the width will remain $3$ inches.\n\nThe area at Stage 6 is then $(18)(3) = \\boxed{54}$ square inches.",
    "To find the area of the rectangle at Stage 6, let's first analyze the pattern in the stages given.\n\n- Stage 1: A single 3'' by 3'' square has an area of $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ square inches.\n- Stage 2: A second 3'' by 3'' square is added. Since the second square is placed right next to the first square, we now have a rectangle with length 3'' (equal to the side of one square) and width 6'' (equal to the sum of the lengths of both squares). Thus, the area of Stage 2 is $3 \\cdot 6 = 18$ square inches.\n- Stage 3: The third 3'' by 3'' square is now added. This will change the width of the rectangle; it will now be equal to the sum of the lengths of the first two squares, i.e., 3'' + 3'' = 6'' (the width at Stage 2), but it will change the length. The length at Stage 2 was 6'' (three 3'' squares laid in a row), but from this Stage onwards, the length will increase from 3'' from each new added square, and the current length from the squares in place from the previous stages from each added from from each of those stages, from from from from from the Stage from from from from the Stage. Since the second Stage already has 6'' as its width, from now on we start calculating by both the width and the length. Thus if we assume the change in width not being 6'' but the original length of one square being 3'' then, and sticking to the logic of the question adding squares but equal to the original changes change, we know that 6'' would be the width from the Stage onwards due to new squares being added next to the ones in place already, so we have 3 squares at this point of that length already, both sticking to 3'' and with another at another. The result of a third length added now resulting in 9'' as length sticking to 4 squares. Thus at this stage, the result we have 3'' by 9'' = 27 square inches. from these particular squares in place.\n\n- Stage 4: At this point of a fourth square being added now, this is now with another change of an another. The result of four squares resulting in 9'' by 12'' = 108 square inches now\n\n\n- Stage 5: At this point, again we have 3'' by 15'' = 45 square inches result of five squares\n\n- Stage 6: At this point, again we have 3'' by 18'' = 54 square inches result of six squares.\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle at Stage 6 is $\\boxed{54}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to find the pattern of the number of squares added at each stage and then use it to find the area at Stage 6.\n\nAt Stage 1, there is 1 square of size 3'' by 3''.\nThe area at Stage 1 is $3\\times3=9$ square inches.\n\nAt Stage 2, there are 2 squares of size 3'' by 3''.\nThe total area added is 2 square inches, and the total area is $9+2=11$ square inches.\n\nAt Stage 3, there are 3 squares of size 3'' by 3''.\nThe total area added is 3 square inches, and the total area is $11+3=14$ square inches.\n\nWe can see that the number of squares added at each stage is increasing by 1.\n\nAt Stage 4, there are 4 squares of size 3'' by 3''.\nThe total area added is 4 square inches, and the total area is $14+4=18$ square inches.\n\nAt Stage 5, there are 5 squares of size 3'' by 3''.\nThe total area added is 5 square inches, and the total area is $18+5=23$ square inches.\n\nAt Stage 6, there are 6 squares of size 3'' by 3''.\nThe total area added is 6 square inches.\n\nTo find the total area, we need to use the fact that the original width of the rectangle is the width of 1 square (3 inches), and with each subsequent stage, 1 square (3 inches by 3 inches) is added to the right of the previous rectangle, which is increasing the length by 3\u2019. This is because the rectangle formed at Stage 1 was 3\u201d by 3\u201d. And, so, to the Stage 6 rectangle\u2019s length we add 3\u201d (3 inches) 5 times (to Stage 6\u2019s 6th \u201cunit block\u201d), and to this total, we add 6 inches across that results from the 6 \u201cunits\u201d at Stage 6, to get the result (6+5)(3\u2019.  Recall now  \u201cunits = squares\u201d and it\u2019s the two ways that we refer to rectangle constructions stages. To get total length, multiply 6 by 3, then take 6 of 3. And we add their sum to 3 times of 6 we get (3*6 + 6*3) + 3 = 3*9 + 3, which must equal to 3*(9+1) = 3*10. And remember that, in order to \u201cmaintain\u201d our previous two equation objects == we multiply by 4 we must multiply by a == we multiply by 3 we \u201c == we multiply by a,\u201d we must multiply by 4, so to get total area in square inches we multiply by 4.
