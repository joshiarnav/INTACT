    "To solve this problem, let's start by factoring the given equation:\n\n$x^2 + ax = -14$\n\nFactor out $x$:\n\n$x(x + a) = -14$\n\nSince we know that the equation has only integer solutions for $x$, let's consider the factors of $-14$:\n\nThe factors of $-14$ are $(1, -14)$, $(-1, 14)$, $(2, -7)$, and $(-2, 7)$.\n\nWe can equate these factors to the form $x$ and $(x + a)$:\n\nCase 1: $x = 1$ and $x + a = -14$\n\nFrom the first equation, we get $x = 1$.\n\nSubstituting $x = 1$ into the second equation, we get $1 + a = -14$\n\nSolving for $a$, we get $a = -15$.

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I can see that all three solutions arrive at the same conclusion: the greatest possible value of $a$ is 15. However, Solution 1 and Solution 2 provide a more detailed and systematic approach to finding the factor pairs of 14 and determining the corresponding values of $a$. Solution 3 provides a more brute-force approach by considering each factor pair separately.\n\nBased on the clarity and thoroughness of the explanations, I would select Solution 2 as the best solution. Therefore, the index number of the best solution is:\n\n2",
  "solution": "The left-hand side factors into $x(x+a)=-14$, so $x$ and $x+a$ both divide $-14$. One of the two factors is negative and the other positive, since their product is negative. $x+a>x$, so $x+a>0$ and $x<0$. This leaves 4 possibilities for $x$, since it is negative and divides $-14$ evenly: $-1$, $-2$, $-7$, and $-14$. $x=-1$ gives $x+a=14$ and therefore $a=15$. Similarly, $x=-2$, $x=-7$, and $x=-14$ give $a=9$, $a=9$, and $a=15$, respectively. The largest value for $a$ is thus $\\boxed{15}$.",
