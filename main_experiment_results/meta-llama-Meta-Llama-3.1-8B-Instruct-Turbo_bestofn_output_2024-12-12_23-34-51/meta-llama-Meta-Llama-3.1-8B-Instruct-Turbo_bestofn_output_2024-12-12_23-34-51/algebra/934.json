    "To solve for the value of $a$, we first need to find the equation of the parabola in vertex form. The vertex form of a parabola is given by:\n\n\\[y = a(x-h)^2 + k\\]\n\nwhere $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the parabola.\n\nGiven that the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, we can substitute $h=-4$ and $k=0$ into the equation:\n\n\\[y = a(x-(-4))^2 + 0\\]\n\\[y = a(x+4)^2\\]\n\nNow that we have the equation in vertex form, we need to find the value of $a$. Since the parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, we can substitute $x=1$ and $y=-75$ into the equation:\n\n\\[-75 = a(1+4)^2\\]\n\\[-75 = a(5)^2\\]\n\\[-75 = 25a\\]\n\nTo solve for $a$, we can divide both sides of the equation by $25$:\n\n\\[a = \\frac{-75}{25}\\]\n\\[a = \\boxed{-3}\\]",

    "To solve this problem, we can start by using the fact that the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$ and the standard equation for a parabola can be written as:\n\n$$y = a(x-h)^2 + k$$\n\nwhere $(h,k)$ is the vertex. In this case, $h = -4$ and $k = 0$. Plugging these values into the equation gives us:\n\n$$y = a(x+4)^2$$\n\nSince the parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, we can plug these values into the equation to get:\n\n$$-75 = a(1+4)^2$$\n\nExpanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get:\n\n$$-75 = a(5)^2$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$-75 = 25a$$\n\nNow we can solve for $a$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $25$:\n\n$$a = \\frac{-75}{25}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$a = -3$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{-3}$."

  "solution": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic must be of the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$.  The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, which gives us the equation $-75 = 25a$.  Hence, $a = -75/25 = \\boxed{-3}$.",
