    "To find the sum of the first six terms in the geometric sequence, we need to find the common ratio and use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:\n\nThe common ratio (r) is the ratio of any term to its previous term. In this case, we can use the second term divided by the first term:\n\nr = (1/4) / (1/2) = 1/2\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:\n\nS_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nwhere:\n- S_n is the sum of the first n terms\n- a is the first term\n- r is the common ratio\n- n is the number of terms\n\nGiven that a = 1/2, r = 1/2, and n = 6, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nS_6 = (1/2) * (1 - (1/2)^6) / (1 - 1/2)\n= (1/2) * (1 - (1/64)) / (1/2)\n= (1/2) * (63/64) / (1/2)\n= 63/64\n\nSo, the sum of the first six terms in the geometric sequence is 63/64.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{63}{64}}$",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Identify the first term (a) and the common ratio (r) of the geometric sequence.\n   The first term (a) is $\\frac12$.\n   The common ratio (r) can be found by dividing any term by its previous term. \n   Let's choose the second and first terms to find the common ratio.\n   So, the common ratio (r) is $\\frac{\\frac14}{\\frac12} = \\frac14$.\n\n2. The formula to find the nth term of a geometric sequence is:\n   an = a * r^(n-1)\n   We know a and r, and we want to sum the first six terms (n = 1 to 6).\n\n3. To sum the first six terms, we can use the formula:\n   S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n   where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\n4. We substitute a = $\\frac12$, r = $\\frac14$, and n = 6 into the formula.\n   S = $\\frac12 * (1 - (\\frac14)^6) / (1 - \\frac14)$\n   Simplify the expression inside the parentheses first:\n   $(\\frac14)^6 = \\frac{1}{4096}$ and\n   $1 - \\frac{1}{4096} = \\frac{4095}{4096}$\n   S = $\\frac12 * \\frac{4095}{4096} / \\frac34$\n   Simplify the expression by multiplying and dividing by the LCD, which is 4096.\n   S = $\\frac{(4095)(2)}{(4096)(3)}$\n   S = $\\frac{8190}{12288}$\n\nHowever the fractions $\\frac{8190}{12288}$ can be reduced by finding a common factor. \n\nTo determine the greatest common factor of 8190 and 12288 we find we can find that 2 and 3 are the larger common factor we can divide both numbers by. Hence  $\\frac{8190 \\div 2 \\div 3}{12288 \\div 2 \\div 3}$ or $\\frac{8190 \\div 6}{12288 \\div 6}$ = $\\frac{1365}{2048}$"
