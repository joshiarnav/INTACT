    "To find the number of distinct sequences of four letters that can be made from the letters in EQUALS, we need to follow the given conditions.\n\nStep 1: The first letter must be L, so there is only one choice for the first letter.\n\nStep 2: The last letter must be Q, so there is only one choice for the last letter.\n\nStep 3: The second and third letters must be chosen from the remaining letters (E, U, A, S) without repetition. We can select the second letter in 4 ways (since there are 4 options), and then for the third letter, there will be 3 options remaining.\n\nStep 4: Now we can find the total number of distinct sequences of four letters: \n   For each of the 4 options for the second letter, there are 3 options for the third letter.\n   So the number of sequences is (number of options for second letter) * (number of options for third letter) \n   This is equal to (4 * 3) = 12.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct sequences of four letters is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "To find the number of distinct sequences of four letters, we need to consider the restrictions given in the problem. \n\n1. Each sequence must begin with L. Since the first letter is fixed, we have only 1 choice for the first letter (L).\n\n2. Each sequence must end with Q. Since the last letter is fixed, we have only 1 choice for the last letter (Q).\n\n3. No letter can appear in a sequence more than once. This means we can use the letters E, U, A, and S for the second and third positions. \n\nWe are left with 4 letters (E, U, A, S) for the second position. Since we cannot repeat any letter in the sequence, we have 4 choices for the second position.\n\nFor the third position, we have 3 remaining letters to choose from (since one letter was used in the second position).\n\nNow we multiply the number of choices for each position to find the total number of distinct sequences:\n\n1 (choice for first position) * 4 (choices for second position) * 3 (choices for third position) * 1 (choice for last position) = 12\n\nSo, there are $\\boxed{12}$ distinct sequences of four letters that can be made from the letters in EQUALS.",
    "To find the number of distinct sequences of four letters, we have to follow these steps:\n\n1. The first letter of the sequence is fixed as L. This means we have only 1 choice for the first position, so we multiply by 1.\n\n2. The last letter of the sequence is fixed as Q. Like the first position, this means we have only 1 choice for the last position.\n\n   So, we multiply by 1.\n\n3. We have four letters left: E, U, A, and S. The second letter of the sequence can be any of these four letters since it cannot repeat and Q has used up its instance. So, we have 4 options. We multiply by 4.\n\n4. Now we have three letters left: E, U, and A, since S is used up by your choice in step (3) for the second letter of the sequence. The third letter can be any of these three options since repetition is not allowed and L has used up its instance. So, we have 3 options. We multiply by 3.\n\nSo, the total number of distinct sequences of four letters is 1 x 1 x 4 x 3 = 12.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{12}$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They arrive at the same answer, 12, using different methods. \n\nHowever, Solution 1 is the most concise and straightforward. It directly addresses the problem conditions and uses a clear, step-by-step approach to arrive at the solution. Therefore, the best solution is:\n\n1",
  "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",
