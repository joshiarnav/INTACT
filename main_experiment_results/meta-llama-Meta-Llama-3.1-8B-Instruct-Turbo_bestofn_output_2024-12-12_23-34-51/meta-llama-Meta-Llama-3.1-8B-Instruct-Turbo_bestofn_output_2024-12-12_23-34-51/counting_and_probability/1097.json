    "To find the different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set, we need to consider the maximum and minimum differences that can be obtained.\n\nThe largest difference will be obtained when we subtract the smallest number from the largest number in the set, i.e., 6 - 1 = 5.\n\nThe smallest difference will be obtained when we subtract consecutive numbers in the set, i.e., 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nNow, we can list the possible differences obtained by subtracting distinct members of the set:\n\n- 5 (6 - 1)\n- 4 (6 - 2, 5 - 1)\n- 3 (6 - 3, 5 - 2, 4 - 1)\n- 2 (6 - 4, 5 - 3, 4 - 2, 3 - 1)\n- 1 (6 - 5, 5 - 4, 4 - 3, 3 - 2, 2 - 1)\n\nWe can see that there are 5 positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",

    "To find the different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set, we will find the difference of each number with every other number in the set, excluding when the first number is larger than the second, because the order (which) of the numbers matters in subtraction (the subtraction of 5 minus 6 is different than 6 minus 5).\n\n1. Find the differences for 1: \n   - $2 - 1 = 1$\n   - $3 - 1 = 2$\n   - $4 - 1 = 3$\n   - $5 - 1 = 4$\n   - $6 - 1 = 5$\n\n2.

  "critique": "Let's analyze each solution:\n\nSolution 1: This solution is correct. It considers the maximum and minimum differences that can be obtained and lists all the possible differences.

It considers the possible differences and lists all the possible differences. However, it makes a mistake in the explanation, saying that the integers 2, 3, 4, 5 are already present, when in fact they are not. The correct explanation is that the largest possible difference is 5 and that all the differences from 1 to 5 are present.\n\nSolution 3: This solution is correct. It finds the differences for each number with every other number in the set, excluding when the first number is larger than the second. It then combines all the different numbers and correctly identifies that there are 5 positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set.\n\nHowever, Solution 1 is the most straightforward and easiest to understand. It directly considers the maximum and minimum differences and lists all the possible differences.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "It is clear that the maximal positive difference is $6 - 1 = 5$. Moreover, we can use 6 to ensure that we can get all positive integer differences up to 5: $6 - 5 = 1$, $6 - 4 = 2$, $6 - 3 = 3$, $6 - 2 = 4$, $6 - 1 = 5$. So, there are $\\boxed{5}$ possible differences.",
