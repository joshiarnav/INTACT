  "all_solutions": [
    "To find the total number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row without any restrictions, we use the factorial of 8, denoted as 8!. \n\n8! = 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 40320\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways 8 people can be seated with John, Wilma, and Paul sitting in three consecutive seats. Since these three can be considered as a single group, we have 6 units in total (3 people as 1 unit, and the remaining 5 people). The number of ways these 6 units can be seated is 6! \n\nHowever, within the group of John, Wilma, and Paul, the 3 people can also be arranged among themselves. This can be done in 3! ways.\n\nSo, the total number of ways 8 people can be seated with John, Wilma, and Paul sitting in three consecutive seats is 6! \u00d7 3!.\n\n6! = 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 720\n3! = 24\n6! \u00d7 3! = 720 \u00d7 24 = 17280\n\nNow, to find the number of ways 8 people can be seated without John, Wilma, and Paul sitting in three consecutive seats, we subtract the number of ways they are sitting in three consecutive seats from the total number of ways 8 people can be seated without any restrictions. \n\nTotal ways without restrictions - ways with John, Wilma, and Paul in consecutive seats \n= 40320 - 17280\n= 23040\n\nSo, the total number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row with the restriction is $\\boxed{23040}$.",
    "To find the number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row, we'll first consider the total number of arrangements without any restrictions. Then, we'll find the number of arrangements where John, Wilma, and Paul do sit in three consecutive seats, and subtract that from the total.\n\nThe total number of ways to seat 8 people in a row is $8!$ (8 factorial), which equals $8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 40,320$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where John, Wilma, and Paul sit in three consecutive seats. We can treat them as a single unit (or block), so there are now 6 units in total: the block of three people and the 5 other people. These 6 units can be arranged in $6!$ ways.\n\nHowever, within the block, John, Wilma, and Paul can be arranged in $3!$ ways. So the total number of arrangements where they sit in three consecutive seats is $6! \\times 3! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6,720 \\times 6 = 40,320$.\n\nWait, this seems to be the same as the total number of arrangements without any restrictions. This is because we've overcounted the cases where the block of three is at the beginning or end of the row, followed by one or more of the other people. \n\nIn the cases where the three consecutive seats are at the start, 6! ways are reduced, in the cases where the three consecutive seats are at the end, we have the other 5 people seated first, then followed by block, in the cases where the three consecutive seats are in the middle of the seating configuration, the block is sitting three seats together on one end of a string of 5 people sitting next to that, with the number of other setups in between them dividing the total 6! (treated blocks as individual units) we must reduce, divide by 3! (the unit configuration that 6 people are seated next to each other in a seating of two units a block, then the other 5), and, in order to properly calculate our final solution, since the three blocks as (consistent unit, three) blocks aren't at one end, the final possible arrangement number is $(8! - 6!3!)/6$ \n\nNow let's correctly solve for our answer. The number of ways the 8 people can be seated in a row with John, Wilma, and Paul not sitting in three consecutive seats is $(8! - 6!3!)/6$ which equals \n$(8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 - (6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times (3 \\times 2 \\times 1)))/6$\n\nThen dividing everything out, the $(6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1)$ cancels out on the top & bottom respectively.\n\n$(8 \\times 7 \\times (6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1) - (3 \\times 2 \\times 1)) /6$\n\nAll $(6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1)$ cancels out, to be left with:\n$(8 \\times 7 - (3 \\times 2 \\times 1))/6$\n\nWhich simplifies to $(56-6)/6$\n\nWhich simplifies to 50/6\n\nWhich further simplifies to $25/3 *2$\n\nWhich simplifies to 50/3\n\nWhich is our final solution.",
    "To solve this problem, we can first find the total number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row with no restrictions. Then, we subtract the number of ways John, Wilma, and Paul are seated in three consecutive seats.\n\n1. Total number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row with no restrictions:\nThe total number of ways n people can be seated in a row is given by n!. So, the number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row is 8! (8 factorial).\n\n2. Number of ways John, Wilma, and Paul are seated in three consecutive seats:\nWe treat John, Wilma, and Paul as a single block. So, there are 6 \"people\" remaining, which can be seated in 6! ways. However, within that block, John, Wilma, and Paul can be arranged in 3! ways. Hence, the total number of ways John, Wilma, and Paul are seated in three consecutive seats is 6! * 3!.\n\nHowever, within that block of 3 people, 3 people can be arranged in 6 different spots they can occupy, so we should multiply this by 6. Therefore, we get 6! * 3! * 6, which equals 6! * 18.\n\n3. Subtract the number of ways John, Wilma, and Paul are seated in three consecutive seats from the total:\nTotal number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row = 8!\nTotal number of ways John, Wilma, and Paul are seated in three consecutive seats = 6! * 18\nTotal number of restricted ways to seat the people = 8! - 6! * 18\n\nTo calculate this number, we need a calculator: \n8! = 40320\n6! = 720\n6! * 18 = 720 * 18 = 12960\nNow subtract: \n40320 - 12960 = 27360\n\nSo, the answer is: \n$\\boxed{27360}$"

It correctly calculates the total number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row without any restrictions and then subtracts the number of ways John, Wilma, and Paul are seated in three consecutive seats. However, it incorrectly states that the number of ways John, Wilma, and Paul are seated in three consecutive seats is the same as the total number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row without any restrictions.\n\nSolution 3: This solution is correct. It accurately calculates the total number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row without any restrictions and then subtracts the number of ways John, Wilma, and Paul are seated in three consecutive seats.\n\nThe best solution is Solution 1 and Solution 3. Both solutions are correct and straightforward. However, Solution 1 is slightly more concise and easier to follow.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is: 1 and 3",
  "solution": "The number of all seating arrangements is $8!$. The number of seating arrangements in which John, Wilma and Paul sit next to each other is $6!\\times 3!$. We can arrive at $6!\\times 3!$ by considering John, Wilma and Paul as one person, arranging the ``six'' people (the JWP super-person plus the 5 other people) first, then arranging John, Wilma and Paul.
