    "To find the expected number of 1's obtained from two standard dice, we need to consider the probabilities of getting 1's on each die and then add them up. \n\n1. **Probability of getting exactly 1 1**: This can occur in two ways: getting 1 on the first die and any number on the second die, or getting any number on the first die and 1 on the second die. However, since the order matters (first die is 1, second die is any, vs first die is any, second die is 1) we therefore need for the number of possibilities, to multiply the possibilities for each case: for the first case the probability is 1/6 * (1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6) = 1/6 * (1/6 + 5/6) = 1/6 * 6/6 = 1/6. \nFor the second case the probability is similarly 5/6 * (1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6) = 5/6 * (1/6 + 5/6) = 5/6 * 6/6 = 5/6 = 5/6. Adding these two probabilities for the first and second cases, gives 1/6 + 5/6 for a total of 6/6 or 1. Thus the expected number of 1's given exactly 1 one is 1/6 * 1 = 1/6. However we are looking for outcomes where there is some number that is 1's therefore we need to take the complement of these results so we can achieve the results 2: \n\n\n2. **The probability of obtaining zero 1's**: The probability of not obtaining any 1's is therefore (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36 as each die has 5 faces which are not a one.",
    "To find the expected number of 1's obtained when two standard dice are rolled, we need to consider the possible outcomes and their probabilities.\n\n1. **Total outcomes**: When two dice are rolled, there are 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes.\n\n2. **Number of 1's in each outcome**: To calculate the expected number of 1's, we need to consider two cases: (i) no 1's, (ii) one 1, and (iii) two 1's.\n\n   - Case (i): No 1's occur when both dice show a number other than 1.\n     - **Probability**: The probability of a single die showing a number other than 1 is 5/6. Since both dice must show a number other than 1, we multiply these probabilities: (5/6) x (5/6) = 25/36.\n\n   - Case (ii): One 1 occurs when one of the dice shows a 1, and the other die shows a number other than 1.\n\n     - **Probability**: There are two ways this can happen: (i) the first die shows 1, and the second die shows a number other than 1, or (ii) the first die shows a number other than 1, and the second die shows 1.\n\n     - To calculate the probability for (i), we multiply the probability that the first die shows 1 (1/6) by the probability that the second die shows a number other than 1 (5/6): (1/6) x (5/6) = 5/36.\n\n     - The probability for (ii) is the same as (i) since the dice are symmetric. So, the total probability for case (ii) is 5/36 + 5/36 = 10/36.\n\n   - Case (iii): Two 1's occur when both dice show a 1.\n\n     - **Probability**: The probability of both dice showing a 1 is (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/36.\n\n3. **Expected number of 1's**: We multiply the number of 1's in each case by the probability of that case, and add them together.\n\n   - Case (i): No 1's - 0 x (25/36) = 0\n   - Case (ii): One 1 - 1 x (10/36) = 10/36\n   - Case (iii): Two 1's - 2 x (1/36) = 2/36\n\n   Now we add them together to find the expected number of 1's: 0 + 10/36 + 2/36 = 12/36.\n\n   The greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator of the fraction is 12.

    "To find the expected number of 1's obtained when rolling two standard dice, let's consider all possible outcomes.\n\nEach die has 6 faces with numbers 1 through 6.

We'll calculate the probability of obtaining 0, 1, or 2 1's.\n\n**Obtaining 0 1's:**\n- The only way to get 0 1's is to roll 2 numbers that are not 1. This can happen in 5 * 5 = 25 ways (5 faces on each die with numbers 2-6).\n\nProbability of getting 0 1's = (Number of ways to get 0 1's) / (Total number of outcomes)\n= 25 / 36\n\n**Obtaining 1 1:**\n- We can get 1 1 in two scenarios:\n  - The first die is a 1 and the second is not (5 possibilities for the second die).\n  - The second die is a 1 and the first is not (5 possibilities for the first die).\n- Therefore, there are 5 * 1 + 1 * 5 = 10 ways to get 1 1.\n\nProbability of getting 1 1 = (Number of ways to get 1 1) / (Total number of outcomes)\n= 10 / 36\n\n**Obtaining 2 1's:**\n- The only way to get 2 1's is when both dice show a 1.\n- There is 1 way to get 2 1's.\n\nProbability of getting 2 1's = (Number of ways to get 2 1's) / (Total number of outcomes)\n= 1 / 36\n\nNow that we have the probabilities, we can find the expected number of 1's. \n\nExpected number of 1's = (Probability of getting 0 1's) * 0 + (Probability of getting 1 1) * 1 + (Probability of getting 2 1's) * 2\n= (25 / 36) * 0 + (10 / 36) * 1 + (1 / 36) * 2\n= (0 + 10/36 + 2/36)\n= (10 + 2) / 36\n= 12 / 36\n= 1 / 3\n\nSo, the expected number of 1's when rolling two standard dice is:\n\n$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and arrive at the same result: the expected number of 1's when rolling two standard dice is 1/3.\n\nHowever, if I had to select the best solution based on clarity, organization, and mathematical accuracy, I would choose:\n\n**Solution 2**\n\nThis solution is well-structured and easy to follow.

  "solution": "The probability of rolling a number other than 1 on one die is $\\frac{5}{6}$, so the probability of rolling zero 1's on two dice is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{36}$. The probability of rolling a 1 on one die is $\\frac{1}{6}$, so the probability of rolling 1's on two dice (for a total of two 1's) is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{36}$. Since the only other possibility is rolling exactly one 1, the probability of rolling one 1 is $1-\\frac{25}{36}-\\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{10}{36}$. We find the expected number of 1's to be $E = \\frac{1}{36} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{10}{36} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{25}{36} \\cdot 0 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
