    "To find the sum of all integer values n for which $\\binom{20}{n}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{11}$, let's break down the problem.\n\nThe equation can be rewritten using Pascal's rule, which states that $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \\binom{n-1}{k}$. Applying this rule to the given equation:\n\n$\\binom{20}{n}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{11}$\n\nUsing Pascal's rule on the right-hand side, we get:\n\n$\\binom{21}{11} = \\binom{20}{10} + \\binom{20}{11}$\n\nSubstituting this into the original equation:\n\n$\\binom{20}{n} = \\binom{20}{11}$\n\nThis implies that $n = 11$ or $n = 9$, since $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integer values $n$ for which $\\binom{20}{n}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{11}$ is:\n\n$\\boxed{11 + 9 = 20}$",
    "To find the sum of all integer values $n$ for which $\\binom{20}{n} + \\binom{20}{10} = \\binom{21}{11}$, let's start by applying Pascal's identity, which states that $\\binom{n}{k-1}+\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n+1}{k}$. We can rewrite $\\binom{21}{11}$ using Pascal's identity as $\\binom{21}{11}=\\binom{20}{11}+\\binom{20}{10}$.\n\nComparing this with the given equation, we can equate $\\binom{20}{n}$ with $\\binom{20}{11}$, so we have $\\binom{20}{n}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{20}{11}+\\binom{20}{10}$.\n\nNow, the $\\binom{20}{10}$ cancels out, leaving us with $\\binom{20}{n}=\\binom{20}{11}$. This suggests that $n$ must be equal to $11$ or $9$, because the binomial coefficient is symmetric, i.e., $\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integer values $n$ for which $\\binom{20}{n} + \\binom{20}{10} = \\binom{21}{11}$ is $11 + 9 = 20$. \n\nSo, the answer is: $\\boxed{20}$.",
    "To find the sum of all integer values n that satisfy the equation, we can use Pascal's Identity, which states that:\n\n$\\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\\binom{n-1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k}$\n\nIn this case, if we let $n=21$, $k=11$, then applying Pascal's Identity, we obtain:\n\n$\\binom{20}{10}+\\binom{20}{11}=\\binom{21}{11}$\n\nComparing both instances of the equation, we can see that $n=11$ satisfies the equation. Similarly, since $\\binom{m}{k}=\\binom{m}{m-k}$, if we let $k=20-n$, we can obtain another instance of $\\binom{20}{n}$ for n=9.\n\n$\\binom{20}{20-9}+\\binom{20}{9}=\\binom{21}{11}$\n\nThis shows that $n=9$ also satisfies the equation.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integer values $n$ that satisfy the equation is $n=9+11=20$.\n\n$\\boxed{20}$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and arrive at the same answer, which is 20. However, I would select Solution 1 as the best solution. \n\nSolution 1 is concise and directly applies Pascal's rule to simplify the equation, leading to the conclusion that n = 11 or n = 9. The symmetry property of binomial coefficients is used to justify these values of n.\n\nSolution 2 is also correct but slightly more verbose than Solution 1. It applies Pascal's identity in a slightly different way but still arrives at the same result.\n\nSolution 3 is also correct but seems to be more of a rehash of the other two solutions. It applies Pascal's identity to a specific case and then uses the symmetry property of binomial coefficients to arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
