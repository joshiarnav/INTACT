    "To find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, let's start by finding the total number of three-digit numbers.\n\nThe smallest three-digit number is 100 and the largest is 999. So the total number of three-digit numbers is:\n\n$999 - 100 + 1 = 900$\n\nNow, let's find the number of multiples of 5 and 7 within the three-digit range.\n\nMultiples of 5: The smallest multiple of 5 in the range is 100, and the largest is 995.\nThe number of multiples of 5 can be found by dividing the largest multiple by 5 and subtracting the result of the smallest multiple divided by 5, then adding 1.\nSo, the number of multiples of 5 is:\n$\\left\\lfloor\\frac{995}{5}\\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor\\frac{100}{5}\\right\\rfloor + 1 = 199 - 20 + 1 = 180$\n\nMultiples of 7: The smallest multiple of 7 in the range is 105, and the largest is 994.\nThe number of multiples of 7 can be found by dividing the largest multiple by 7 and subtracting the result of the smallest multiple divided by 7, then adding 1.\nSo, the number of multiples of 7 is:\n$\\left\\lfloor\\frac{994}{7}\\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor\\frac{105}{7}\\right\\rfloor + 1 = 142 - 15 + 1 = 128$\n\nNow, let's find the number of multiples of both 5 and 7, which is the same as the multiples of their LCM (Least Common Multiple).\n\nThe LCM of 5 and 7 is 35. The smallest multiple of 35 within the three-digit range is 105, and the largest is 980.\nThe number of multiples of 35 is:\n$\\left\\lfloor\\frac{980}{35}\\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor\\frac{105}{35}\\right\\rfloor + 1 = 28 - 3 + 1 = 26$\n\nTo find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, we need to subtract the number of multiples of 5 and 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers, then add back the number of multiples of both 5 and 7 (to avoid double counting).\n\nThe number of multiples of neither 5 nor 7 is:\n$900 - (180 + 128) + 26$\n$= 900 - 308 + 26$\n$= 618$\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n$\\boxed{618}$",
    "To find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Count all three-digit numbers**: The smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest three-digit number is 999. We can count the total numbers in this range by subtracting the lower limit from the upper limit and adding 1: \n   \\[999 - 100 + 1 = 900.\\]\n   So, there are 900 three-digit numbers in total.\n\n2. **Count multiples of 5**: To find how many three-digit numbers are multiples of 5, we can first identify the smallest and the largest multiples of 5 in this range. The smallest multiple of 5 in this range is 100, and the largest multiple of 5 is 995. Since multiples of 5 repeat every 5 numbers, we can calculate the numbers by the formula \n   \\[(995 - 100) / 5 + 1 = 180.\\]\n   Therefore, there are 180 multiples of 5.\n\n3. **Count multiples of 7**: Using a similar approach to the previous step, to find the number of three-digit multiples of 7, we need to look at the smallest and the largest multiples of 7 in this range.

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and yield the same answer of 618. However, Solution 1 provides a more detailed explanation and uses the floor function to calculate the number of multiples, which is a more precise approach.\n\nSolution 2 uses a simpler approach to calculate the number of multiples, but it may not be as accurate as Solution 1, especially when dealing with larger ranges.\n\nSolution 3 uses the principle of inclusion-exclusion, which is a more general approach that can be applied to more complex problems. However, in this specific case, it is not as straightforward as Solutions 1 and 2.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best solution is:\n\n1",
  "solution": "It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 5 or 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \\times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 that is a three-digit number is $142 \\times 7 = 994$.  Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7.  The smallest multiple of 5 that is a three-digit number is $20\\times 5 = 100$, and the largest multiple of 5 that is a three digit number is $199\\times 5 =995$. So there are $199-20+1=180$ multiples of 5.\n\nNow notice that we have counted some numbers twice: those multiples of $5\\times7=35$. The smallest multiple of 35 is $3\\times 35 = 105$, the largest multiple of 35 is $28\\times35 =980$. So there are $28-3+1=26$ multiples of 35.\n\nWe have 128 multiples of 7 and 180 multiples of 5, but we count 26 multiples twice.  So, there are a total of $128+180-26 = 282$ distinct three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 (or both).   There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-282=\\boxed{618}$ three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7 nor 5.",
