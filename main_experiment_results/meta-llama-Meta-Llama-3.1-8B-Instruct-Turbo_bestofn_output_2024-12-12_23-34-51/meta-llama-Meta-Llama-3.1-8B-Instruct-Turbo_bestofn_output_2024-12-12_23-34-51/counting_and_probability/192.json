    "To find the probability that point $P$ is closer to point $C$ than to either of the points $A$ or $B$, we should visualize the area of the triangle where it applies.\n\nStep 1:  Find the points that are equidistant from $A$ and $B$. This area is also called the region of points that are equidistant from the two points, which can be obtained by finding the perpendicular bisector to AB.\n\nStep 2: It would appear, at first glance that the distance from C to the points in line passing through the perpendicular bisector, which also goes through the line connecting A and B, is at a distance of \\frac{1}{2} the line connecting B to C, which is equal to \\frac{4}{2} which equals 2, but this calculation isn't the method to answer our question\n\nHowever, on the other hand, in order to get the area where point P would be, we have to ensure that the point in question, will be at least \\frac{5}{2} distance units away from either of the perpendicular bisector which goes through line connecting A and B. Only then could the distance be at most the distance between C to AB.\n\nStep 3: Draw the perpendicular bisectors on both sides. This perpendicular bisector creates a shape of the area that is inside triangle A, B and C, where P would definitely be at a distance of at least \\frac{5}{2} units.",
    "To find the probability that point P is closer to C than it is to either A or B, we can first identify the regions of the triangle where P is closer to each of the vertices.\n\nSince triangle ABC is a 3-4-5 right triangle with the right angle at C, we can use this information to find the points where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides intersect the triangle. \n\nThe midpoint of side AB is $\\left(\\frac{AB}{2}, \\frac{AC}{2}\\right) = (2.5, 1.5)$.\nThe perpendicular bisector of side AB is $y = -2x + 5$. \nSimilarly, the midpoint of side AC is $\\left(\\frac{AC}{2}, \\frac{BC}{2}\\right) = (1.5, 2)$.\nThe perpendicular bisector of side AC is $y = 2x - 3$.\n\nNow we need to find the intersection of the two perpendicular bisectors to determine the boundary of the region closer to C. Solving the two equations simultaneously:\n\n$y = -2x + 5$ and $y = 2x - 3$.

From the point of intersection (2, 1), you can create the similar triangle with ABC. The scaling factor is $3/4 = 0.75$ and it's towards side AB.\n\nIf the ratio of side AB towards that similar shape is 3/4, that means 1/4 of the triangle's area is on that side towards A.

    "To find the probability that point $P$ is closer to $C$ than it is to either $A$ or $B$, we need to calculate the area of the region within triangle $ABC$ that satisfies this condition, and then divide it by the total area of triangle $ABC$.\n\nStep 1: Find the area of triangle $ABC$. To do this, we can use Heron's formula.\n\nThe semi-perimeter of triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{3+4+5}{2}=6$.

This area can be calculated as $1.5 \\times 2 = 3$.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the probability that point $P$ is closer to $C$ than it is to either $A$ or $B$.
