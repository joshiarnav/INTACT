  "problem": "A pirate is searching for buried treasure on 6 islands. On each island, there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that the island has buried treasure and no traps, a $\\frac{1}{12}$ chance that the island has traps but no treasure, and a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance that the island has neither traps nor treasure.

    "To solve this problem, we need to consider the combination of islands with treasure and islands with neither traps nor treasure. We are given that the pirate must encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps. This means that the remaining 3 islands must have neither traps nor treasure.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 islands out of 6 to have treasure. This can be calculated using combinations:\n\n$\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3! \\cdot 3!} = \\frac{720}{36 \\cdot 6} = 20$\n\nNext, we need to calculate the probability that the 3 chosen islands have treasure and the remaining 3 islands have neither traps nor treasure.\n\nThe probability of an island having treasure is $\\frac{1}{4}$, and the probability of an island having neither traps nor treasure is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nSince we are choosing 3 islands with treasure and 3 islands with neither traps nor treasure, the probability of this occurring on each island is:\n\n$(\\frac{1}{4})^3 \\cdot (\\frac{2}{3})^3$\n\nNow, we need to multiply this by the number of ways to choose 3 islands out of 6 to have treasure, which is 20:\n\n$20 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{4})^3 \\cdot (\\frac{2}{3})^3$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can calculate the numerical value:\n\n$20 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{64}) \\cdot (\\frac{8}{27})$\n\n$= \\frac{160}{1728}$\n\n$= \\frac{5}{54}$\n\nSo, the probability that the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$.",

    "To find the probability that the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps, we need to consider the probabilities of each island having treasure and none having traps. \n\nThere are two main scenarios:\n\n1. Exactly 3 islands have treasure and the remaining 3 islands have neither treasure nor traps.\n2. The pirate first finds the 3 islands with treasure among the first 5 islands, and the last island also has neither treasure nor traps.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\nThe probability of an island having treasure is $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability of an island having neither treasure nor traps is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nWe need to choose 3 islands out of 6 to have treasure. This can be done in $\\binom{6}{3} = 20$ ways.\n\nThe probability of the chosen 3 islands having treasure and the remaining 3 islands having neither treasure nor traps is:\n\n$P(\\text{3 islands with treasure}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3$\n\n$P(\\text{3 islands with neither treasure nor traps}) = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3$\n\nTherefore, the probability of scenario 1 is:\n\n$20 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = 20 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{64}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{8}{27}\\right)$\n\n$= 20 \\cdot \\frac{8}{1728}$\n\n$= \\frac{160}{1728}$\n\n$= \\frac{5}{54}$\n\n**Scenario 2:**\nThe probability of an island having treasure is $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability of an island having neither treasure nor traps is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nWe need to choose 3 islands out of 6 to have treasure. This can be done in $\\binom{6}{3} = 20$ ways. We also need to choose 1 island out of 3 to have neither treasure nor traps after the treasure islands have been chosen. This can be done in $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways.\n\nThe probability of the chosen 3 islands having treasure is:\n\n$P(\\text{3 islands with treasure}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3$\n\nThe probability of the remaining island not having treasure is $\\frac{2}{3}$, and the probability of the last island having neither treasure nor traps is also $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of scenario 2 is:\n\n$20 \\cdot \\binom{3}{1} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}$\n\n$= 20 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{64}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{8}{27}$\n\n$= 60 \\cdot \\frac{8}{1728}$\n\n$= \\frac{480}{1728}$\n\n$= \\frac{10}{36}$\n\n$= \\frac{5}{18}$\n\nNow, let's add the probabilities of both scenarios to get the final probability:\n\n$\\frac{5}{54} + \\frac{5}{18}$\n\nWe need to find a common denominator, which is 54.\n\n$\\frac{5}{54} + \\frac{15}{54}$\n\n$= \\frac{20}{54}$\n\n$= \\frac{10}{27}$\n\nSo, the probability that the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps is $\\boxed{\\frac{10}{27}}$."

  "critique": "Let's analyze each solution for correctness.\n\nSolution 1 is correct. It correctly calculates the probability of the pirate encountering exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps.\n\nSolution 2 is also correct. It uses the binomial distribution to calculate the probability, which is a valid approach.\n\nSolution 3 is incorrect. It overcounts the number of ways to choose 3 islands with treasure and 3 islands with neither treasure nor traps, and it also incorrectly calculates the probability of scenario 2.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is either Solution 1 or Solution 2. However, Solution 1 is more concise and easier to read, so I would recommend it as the best solution.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
