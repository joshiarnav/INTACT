    "To find the probability that Kim does not have a math test today, we need to subtract the given probability from 1. \n\nThe given probability is $\\frac{4}{7}$.\n\nSo, the probability of not having a math test today is $1 - \\frac{4}{7}$.\n\nTo subtract $\\frac{4}{7}$ from 1, we can rewrite 1 as $\\frac{7}{7}$, since any number divided by itself equals 1.\n\nNow, we have $\\frac{7}{7} - \\frac{4}{7}$. \n\nTo subtract these fractions, we need to have the same denominator, which is 7 in this case. \n\nSo, we keep the same denominator and subtract the numerators:\n\n$\\frac{7}{7} - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{7 - 4}{7}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the numerator:\n\n$\\frac{7 - 4}{7} = \\frac{3}{7}$\n\nTherefore, the probability that Kim does not have a math test today is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$.",
    "To find the probability that Kim does not have a math test today, we can use the fact that the sum of the probability of an event happening and the probability of it not happening is equal to 1.\n\nThe probability that Kim has a math test today is given as $\\frac{4}{7}$.\n\nLet's denote the probability that Kim does not have a math test today as $P(\\text{not having a test})$.\n\nWe can write the equation:\n\n$P(\\text{having a test}) + P(\\text{not having a test}) = 1$\n\nSubstituting the given values, we have:\n\n$\\frac{4}{7} + P(\\text{not having a test}) = 1$\n\nNow, we can solve for $P(\\text{not having a test})$ by isolating it on one side of the equation:\n\n$P(\\text{not having a test}) = 1 - \\frac{4}{7}$\n\nTo subtract a fraction from 1, we can convert 1 to a fraction with the same denominator:\n\n$P(\\text{not having a test}) = \\frac{7}{7} - \\frac{4}{7}$\n\nNow, we can subtract the fractions:\n\n$P(\\text{not having a test}) = \\frac{7-4}{7}$\n\n$P(\\text{not having a test}) = \\frac{3}{7}$\n\nTherefore, the probability that Kim does not have a math test today is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$.",
    "To find the probability that Kim does not have a math test today, we need to use the concept of complementary probabilities. \n\nComplementary probabilities states that the probability of an event happening (in this case, Kim having a math test) plus the probability of the event not happening (Kim not having a math test) is equal to 1.\n\nGiven probability of Kim having a math test is $\\frac{4}{7}$.\n\nSo, the probability of Kim not having a math test is $1 - \\frac{4}{7}$.\n\nTo subtract the fraction from 1, we can first convert 1 into a fraction with the same denominator, which is 7:\n\n$1 = \\frac{7}{7}$.\n\nNow, we can subtract the fractions:\n\n$1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{7}{7} - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{7-4}{7} = \\frac{3}{7}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Kim does not have a math test today is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct, but I'll analyze each one for clarity and conciseness.\n\nSolution 1 is a bit wordy, but it correctly explains the concept of subtracting a fraction from 1 by converting 1 to a fraction with the same denominator.\n\nSolution 2 is a bit repetitive, as it states the same concept twice (once in the form of an equation and again in the form of a subtraction). However, it still correctly solves the problem.\n\nSolution 3 is the most concise and straightforward, as it directly applies the concept of complementary probabilities and subtracts the fractions without unnecessary explanation.\n\nBased on the analysis, I would select Solution 3 as the best solution. Therefore, the index number of the best solution is: 3.",
  "solution": "The probability that Kim does not have a math test is equal to one minus the probability she does have a math test. So, the probability of not having a math test is $1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$.",
