    "To find the value of the expression, let's break it down step by step.\n\nGiven expression: $(9! \\cdot 5! \\cdot 2!) / (8! \\cdot 6!)$\n\nStep 1: Write out the factorials in their expanded form:\n\n$9! = 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$\n$8! = 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$\n$5! = 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$\n$2! = 2 \\cdot 1$\n$6! = 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$\n\nStep 2: Cancel out the common terms in the numerator and denominator.\n\n$(9 \\cdot 8!) \\cdot 5! \\cdot 2!$ can be rewritten as $9 \\cdot 8! \\cdot 5! \\cdot 2!$, we have $(8! \\cdot 5! \\cdot 2!) \\cdot 9$. So we can remove the $8!$ from both the numerator and denominator.\n\nThe expression becomes: $(9 \\cdot (5! \\cdot 2!)) / 6!$\n\nStep 3: Simplify the remaining factorials in the expression.\n\n$5! \\cdot 2! = (5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1) \\cdot (2 \\cdot 1)$ \n$5! \\cdot 2! = 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2$\n\nNow we can substitute this back into the expression: $(9 \\cdot (5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2)) / 6!$\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the expression.\n\n$(9 \\cdot (5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2)) = 9 \\cdot 240$\n$9 \\cdot 240 = 2160$\n\n$6! = 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$\n$6! = 720$\n\nNow substitute the values back into the expression: $2160 / 720$\n\nStep 5: Finally, simplify the fraction to find the final answer.\n\n$2160 / 720 = 3$",
    "To find the value of $(9! \\cdot 5! \\cdot 2!) / (8! \\cdot 6!)$, we'll break down the expression and simplify it step by step.\n\n1. Start with the expression: $(9! \\cdot 5! \\cdot 2!) / (8! \\cdot 6!)$\n\n2. Use the definition of the factorial: \n- $9! = 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$\n- $8! = 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$\n- $6! = 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$\n- $5! = 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$\n- $2! = 2 \\cdot 1$\n\n3. Plug in these values into the expression: \n$(9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1) / (8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1)$\n\n4. Cancel out common factors:\n- $9$, $8!$, and $2!$ will remain in the numerator.\n- $8!$ will cancel out from both numerator and denominator leaving 9 in the numerator \n- The whole $6!$ will cancel out as well. And the same thing is happening to $5!$ \n- We will only have 2 left in the numerator because the 4 3 and 2 in the left 5  will cancel the same thing 4 3 and 2 within the 6 factor within the denominator leaving just 2 within the  5 factorial within the numerator\n\n5. Simplify the expression: \n$(9 \\cdot 2) / 1$\n\n6. Perform the multiplication and division to get the final answer: \n$18 / 1$\n$ = 18$\n\nSo, the final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$",
    "To solve this expression, we will simplify step by step.\n\nGiven expression: $(9! \\cdot 5! \\cdot 2!) / (8! \\cdot 6!)$\n\nStep 1: We can write factorials as their expanded form:\n- $n!$ (read as n factorial) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.\n- $9!$ = 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1\n- $8!$ = 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1\n- $5!$ = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1\n- $6!$ = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1\n- $2!$ = 2 x 1\n\nStep 2: Rewrite the expression using expanded factorials:\n$(9! \\cdot 5! \\cdot 2!) / (8! \\cdot 6!) = (9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1) / (8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1)$\n\nStep 3: Notice that 8! appears in both numerator and denominator, and 6! appears in both numerator and denominator. Cancel them to simplify:\n$= (9 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2) / (6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2)$\n\nStep 4: Now, we will simplify the numerator and denominator separately:\nNumerator:\n- We can simplify further by cancelling common terms.\n- There are eight 2s and four 2s in the numerator. We simplify 8 2s to 2 eight to get power to simplify:\n$= (9 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 2) / (6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2)$\nNow, we simplify 8, & 2:\n= (9 * 5 * 4 * 3^2 * 2 *2) / (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 *2 )\nNow, we simplify the denominator for two 2\u2019s, cancels two 2s power to two, &  cancels four fours &  six 3 & 5 threes as one:\n= (9 * 5 * 4 * 3^2 * 2 *2) / (2 * 5 *
