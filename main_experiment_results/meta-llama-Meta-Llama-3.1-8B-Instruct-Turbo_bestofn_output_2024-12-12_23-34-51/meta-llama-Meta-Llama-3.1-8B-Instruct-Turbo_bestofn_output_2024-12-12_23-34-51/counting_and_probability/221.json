    "To find the largest prime divisor of 11! + 12!, we will first factor 12! out of the expression. \n\nSince 12! = 12 * 11!, we can rewrite 11! + 12! as follows:\n\n11! + 12! = 11! + (12 * 11!)\n\nFactoring out 11!, we get:\n11! + 12! = 11!(1 + 12)\n11! + 12! = 11! * 13\n\nNow, both 11! and 13 are composite.

    "To find the largest prime divisor of 11! + 12!, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the given expressions:**\n\n   - 11! (11 factorial) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 11: \n     11! = 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1\n   - 12! (12 factorial) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 12: \n     12! = 12 \u00d7 11! (we can rewrite 12! as 12 times 11!)\n\n2. **Simplify 12!:**\n   We can rewrite 12! as 12 \u00d7 11!:\n   12! = 12 \u00d7 11!\n   = 12 \u00d7 (11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)\n   = 12 \u00d7 11!\n\n3. **Combine 11! and 12!:**\n   Now let's add 11! and 12! together:\n   11! + 12! = 11! + 12 \u00d7 11!\n   = 11! + 11! \u00d7 12\n   = 11! \u00d7 (1 + 12)\n   = 11! \u00d7 13\n\n4. **Find the largest prime factor:**\n   Since 11! is just a product of numbers (1 to 10) which do not contain 13 as a prime factor, the prime factorization of 11! doesn't include 13.\n   13 is a prime number and in 11! + 12! = 11! \u00d7 13, 13 is the largest prime factor.\n\nIn conclusion, the largest prime factor in the expression 11! + 12! is $\\boxed{13}$."
