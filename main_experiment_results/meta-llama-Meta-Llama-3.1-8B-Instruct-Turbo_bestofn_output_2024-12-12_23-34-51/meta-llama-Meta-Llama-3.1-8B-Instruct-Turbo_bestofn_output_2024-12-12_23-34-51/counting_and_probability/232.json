    "To find the probability that $x+y < 3$, we need to consider the area where this condition holds true within the given square.\n\nThe square has side length 2 and thus an area of 4.\n\nWe need to find the area of the shaded region where $x+y < 3$:\n\nTo find this area, let's first visualize the line $x+y = 3$ within the square.\n\nThis line passes through the points (3,0) and (0,3), and intersects the square at the points (1,2) and (2,1).\n\nThe area where $x+y < 3$ includes the entire square minus the area of the right triangle with vertices (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2).\n\nThe area of this right triangle can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle: \n\nArea = 0.5 * base * height\nArea = 0.5 * (2 - 1) * (2 - 1)\nArea = 0.5 * 1 * 1\nArea = 0.5\n\nNow, subtract this area from the area of the entire square:\n\nArea where $x+y < 3$ = 4 - 0.5\nArea where $x+y < 3$ = 3.5\n\nTo find the probability, we divide this area by the total area of the square:\n\nProbability = Area where $x+y < 3$ / Total area of the square\nProbability = 3.5 / 4\n\nTo simplify the fraction, find the greatest common divisor (GDC) for 3.5 and 4:\n\nConvert the decimal 3.5 to a fraction:\n3.5 = 7/2\n\nNow, find the GDC:\nGDC for (7*2) and 4 = GCD(14, 4) = 2\n\nNow simplify the fraction:\nProbability = (7/2)/4\nProbability = (7/2)*(1/4)\nProbability = 7/8\n\nTherefore, the probability is $\\boxed{7/8}$.",
    "To find the probability that $x+y < 3$, we first need to visualize the region defined by the inequality $x+y < 3$. \n\nThe inequality $x+y < 3$ describes a line $y = -x + 3$, and the region below this line satisfies the inequality. \n\nSince the points $(x,y)$ must lie inside the square with vertices (0,0), (0,2), (2,2), and (2,0), the line $x+y < 3$ intersects the square.\n\nWe can find the vertices of the intersection by solving the equation $x+y = 3$ for the boundaries of the square.\n\n1.

    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nThe point $(x,y)$ is randomly chosen inside a square with vertices (0,0), (0,2), (2,2), and (2,0). We want to find the probability that $x+y < 3$.\n\n**Step 2: Visualize the Square and the Inequality**\nThe square has side length 2, and the vertices are (0,0), (0,2), (2,2), and (2,0). The inequality $x+y < 3$ represents the area below the line $y = -x + 3$. We need to find the area inside the square where this condition is satisfied.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Line and Its Intersection with the Square**\nThe line $y = -x + 3$ intersects the square at $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$, and intersects the edges of the square at $(1,2)$ and the point where the line from $(2,1)$ goes through from y value of 1 at -1,1. But since x > 0 we find that the region of interest is a triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(1,2)$, and $(2,1)$. \n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Areas of the Triangle and the Square**\nThe area of the square is $2^2 = 4$.\nThe area of the triangle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle: \n$\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b = 2$ and $h = 1$.\nThe area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(2)(1) = 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Probability**\nThe probability that $x+y < 3$ is the ratio of the area inside the square that satisfies the condition to the area of the entire square.\nThe area that satisfies the condition is the area of the triangle, which is $1$.\nThe area of the entire square is $4$.\nThe probability is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$."
