    "To choose a rectangle, we need two horizontal lines and two vertical lines. \n\nWe can choose two horizontal lines from four lines in $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways, because we are choosing 2 items from a set of 4 items without regard to order.\n\nSimilarly, we can choose two vertical lines from four lines in $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.\n\nTo make a rectangle, these two choices must be made independently. Therefore, the total number of rectangles is the product of the two numbers of ways to choose horizontal and vertical lines.\n\nTotal number of rectangles $= 6 \\times 6 = 36$\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{36}$.",
    "To form a rectangular region, we need two horizontal lines and two vertical lines. \n\nStep 1: Choosing the horizontal lines \nThere are 4 horizontal lines available. We need to choose 2 of them. This can be done in $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{24}{2(2)} = 6$ ways.\n\nStep 2: Choosing the vertical lines \nThere are 4 vertical lines available. We need to choose 2 of them. This can also be done in $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.\n\nStep 3:  Since choosing the horizontal lines and the vertical lines are independent events, we can multiply the number of ways to choose them.

    "To choose a rectangle, we need to select two horizontal and two vertical lines.\n\nStep 1: Select two horizontal lines out of four. This can be done in $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.\n\nStep 2: Once we have chosen two horizontal lines, we need to select two vertical lines out of all four. However, it is possible to select two of the vertical lines from the three that are not adjacent to either of the chosen horizontal lines (resulting in a degenerate rectangle) or we can select the two vertical lines that are adjacent to both of the chosen horizontal lines (resulting in a non degenerate rectangle). Considering the first two vertical lines we can pick such a rectangle in 3 ways. However, if we select the last two vertical lines whose point of intersection will be at the horizontal line picks' top, we have another 3 picks.\n\nTherefore total cases of picking two vertically  is 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nStep 3: Multiply the number of ways to choose the horizontal lines by the number of ways to choose the vertical lines. This gives us a total of $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\nTo account for each rectangle being able to be chosen in two different ways, depending on which set of the horizontal lines were chosen first, we can multiply the total by two. \n\n36 * 2 = 72"

  "critique": "Solution 1 and Solution 2 are identical in their approach and calculation. They correctly calculate the number of ways to choose two horizontal lines and two vertical lines, and multiply these two numbers to get the total number of rectangles.\n\nSolution 3, however, has a flaw in its approach. It considers the cases where a degenerate rectangle is formed, and then tries to account for non-degenerate rectangles by considering the intersection points. However, this approach is incorrect because it overcounts the number of non-degenerate rectangles. The correct approach is to simply choose two horizontal lines and two vertical lines, without considering the intersection points.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1 or Solution 2.\n\nSince Solution 1 and Solution 2 are identical, I will choose Solution 1 as the best solution. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "In order for the four lines to enclose a rectangular region, we must choose two horizontal and two vertical lines.  If we were to choose more than two of one of these types of lines, we would not be able to enclose any region.  We can count independently the number of ways to choose vertical and horizontal lines.  There will be $\\dbinom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose horizontal lines, and the same number of ways to choose two vertical lines.  Since these are independent, there are a total of $6\\cdot 6=\\boxed{36}$ ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle.",
