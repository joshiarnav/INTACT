    "To find the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in, let's analyze the situation.\n\nLet's assume there are $n$ teams with $a_i$ gymnasts in each team, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $n$.\n\nEach gymnast shook hands with all gymnasts on every team except herself. In each team, each gymnast shook hands with $a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_i - a_i$ gymnasts. However, to calculate the total number of handshakes, we should divide each team's total handshakes by $2$ since each handshake involved two gymnasts. Therefore, we can express the total number of handshakes among gymnasts as $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{a_i(a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_i - a_i)}{2}$, which is equivalent to $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{a_i \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i-1})}{2}$.\n\nNow, we consider the number of handshakes involving the coach. The total number of handshakes involving the coach is $b$ (an unknown variable we are trying to minimize), and let $m$ be the number of gymnasts on the coach's team.\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes was equal to $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{a_i \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i-1})}{2} + b$.\n\nSince $a_i \\geq 1$ (a team has at least one gymnast) and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = m + k$ (there are $k$ gymnasts outside of the coach's team), to minimize $b$ and assuming that the smallest integer is $1$ we take the minimum value for $m$ and $k$.\n\nFirst, we start with assuming $k=1$, which requires $m=n$. In this case, the total number of handshakes is no less than $\\frac{(n - 1)n}{4} + b$, where $b$ is the minimum number of handshakes the coach participated in.\n\nSince the total number of handshakes is 281, the number of handshakes among gymnasts is $\\frac{(n-1)n}{4}$; therefore, $\\frac{(n-1)n}{4} \\leq 281$.\n\n$\\frac{n^2 - n}{4} \\leq 281$\n$(n^2 - n) \\leq 1124$\n$n^2 - n - 1124 \\leq 0$\n\nWe need to solve this quadratic inequality to find the maximum value for $n$. First, let's solve $n^2 - n - 1124 = 0$.\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula: $n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=1$, $b=-1$, $c=-1124$.\n\n$n = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-1124)}}{2(1)}$\n$n = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4496}}{2}$\n$n = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{4497}}{2}$\n\nSince $4497$ is a perfect square, as $4497 = 67 \\cdot 67$, $n$ is $\\frac{1+67}{2}$ or $\\frac{1-67}{2}$.\n\nPositive $n$ is $34$. Negative $n$ is $-33$.\n\nWe are trying to maximize $n$. Therefore, we select $n = 34$ as the value to continue with our problem.\n\nWith $n=34$, $\\frac{(n-1)n}{4} = \\frac{(33)(34)}{4} = 280.25$; therefore, $b=281-280.25 = 0.75$.\n\nBut we cannot have a fractional number of handshakes; therefore, the fractional value of $b$ must be rounded up. As a result, the fewest number of handshakes that the coach could have participated in is 1.\n\n$\\boxed{1}$",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Each gymnast shook hands once with every gymnast on every team (except herself). This is a problem of handshakes among teams. In order to find the total number of handshakes among teams, we need to use the formula for combinations. If we have 'n' teams and 'm' gymnasts per team, then the total number of handshakes is given by $T = nC2$. However, gymnast A has shaken hands with other gymnasts on 'n-1' other teams, then in each of those other teams there are 'm gymnasts shaking hands with the gymnast plus the gymnast himself counts toward that team, therefore each player gets to shake in 'm*(n-1)' handshakes, there will be n * m *  (n-m) + n * m. First 3 summation derive term from the total summation required the enclosed $\\frac{n(n-m)(m)}{2} +\\frac{1}{2} n m = \\frac{n(n-1)m}{2}$. $\\frac{n^2 m -nm^2 +nm }{2}$ .\n\n  We also know the coach shook hands with gymnasts on her own team. Adding this to the total number of handshakes we get: $\\frac{n^2 m -nm^2 +nm }{2} +k = 281$\n\n2. The number of gymnasts is given by 'nm = K'. Adding this to equation number 1. the summation makes sense $ (\\frac{n^2 m -nm^2 +nm}{2}) + k = 281$, $(\\frac{(nm)^2 - nm^2  +nm}{2} )+ k$ = 281\n\n    $(\\frac{ k^2 - k + k}{2})+k = 281$ \n  $(\\frac{k^2}{2})+k  = 281$\n\n3.

Solving for 'k', $\\boxed{k =  - 6\\sqrt{2} + 14}$ is not needed since 'k' is negative, we are left with  \n$\\boxed{k= 6 \\sqrt{2} -14}$ .\n\n6.  On simple inspection we can see that  $ \\boxed{k= 26}$ is the smallest integer number that satisfies $(\\frac{k^2}{2} + k = 281)$",
    "To find the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in, we'll first consider the total number of handshakes and work backward from there.\n\nLet's denote the total number of gymnasts by $N$ and the number of handshakes the coach participated in by $C$.\n\nEach gymnast shook hands with every other gymnast except themselves. Therefore, each gymnast participated in $N - 1$ handshakes. Since there are $N$ gymnasts, the total number of handshakes between gymnasts is the number of pairs of gymnasts, which is $\\frac{N(N - 1)}{2}$. This is due to the fact that each pair of gymnasts represents one handshake, and the number of pairs is equal to the sum of the first $N - 1$ positive integers.\n\nNow, the total number of handshakes is the sum of the handshakes between gymnasts and the handshakes involving the coach, which we'll denote as $281$.\n\nTherefore, we have the following equation:\n\n$\\frac{N(N - 1)}{2} + C = 281$\n\n$C = 281 - \\frac{N(N - 1)}{2}$\n\nOur goal is to minimize $C$, which occurs when $\\frac{N(N - 1)}{2}$ is as large as possible. To maximize $\\frac{N(N - 1)}{2}$, $N$ must be a large number, but since the number of handshakes cannot exceed 281, we'll try to find the largest integer $N$ that satisfies the condition $\\frac{N(N - 1)}{2} \\leq 281$.\n\nWe can solve this inequality for $N$ by using the quadratic formula:\n\n$N^2 - N - 562 \\leq 0$,\n\nor by finding the positive solution to the quadratic equation:\n\n$N(N-1)/2 = 281$,\n\nwhich is a rather more accurate way to find $N$, as we know the number of handshakes is exactly $281$.\n\nSolving the above equation for $N$,\n\n$N^2 - N - 562 = 0$\n\n$(N-30)(N+18.85) = 0$\n\nConsidering only the positive root, we get $N = 30$. \n\nTo find the exact number of handshakes that the coach participated in, we can use the formula for $C$:\n\n$C = 281 - \\frac{30(30 - 1)}{2}$\n$C = 281 - \\frac{30(29)}{2}$\n$C = 281 - 435$\n$C = -154$ \n\nSince the number of handshakes cannot be negative, this is an invalid result and thus we should try a smaller value for $N$.\n\nUsing $N = 29$, \n\n$C = 281 - \\frac{29(29-1)}{2}$\n$C = 281 - \\frac{29*28}{2}$\n$C = 281 - 406$\n$C = -125$ \n\nThis is also an invalid result.\n\nUsing $N = 28$, \n\n$C = 281 - \\frac{28(28-1)}{2}$\n$C = 281 - \\frac{28*27}{2}$\n$C = 281 - 378$\n$C = -97$ \n\nThis is also an invalid result.\n\nUsing $N = 27$, \n\n$C = 281 - \\frac{27(27-1)}{2}$\n$C = 281 - \\frac{27*26}{2}$\n$C = 281 - 351$\n$C = -70$ \n\nThis is also an invalid result.\n\nUsing $N = 26$, \n\n$C = 281 - \\frac{26(26-1)}{2}$\n$C = 281 - \\frac{26*25}{2}$\n$C = 281 - 325$\n$C = -44$ \n\nThis is also an invalid result.\n\nUsing $N = 25$, \n\n$C = 281 - \\frac{25(25-1)}{2}$\n$C = 281 - \\frac{25*24}{2}$\n$C = 281 - 300$\n$C = -19$ \n\nThis is also an invalid result.\n\nUsing $N = 24$, \n\n$C = 281 - \\frac{24(24-1)}{2}$\n$C = 281 - \\frac{24*23}{2}$\n$C = 281 - 276$\n$C = 5$ \n\nThis is a valid result.\n\nTherefore, the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in is $\\boxed{5}$."
