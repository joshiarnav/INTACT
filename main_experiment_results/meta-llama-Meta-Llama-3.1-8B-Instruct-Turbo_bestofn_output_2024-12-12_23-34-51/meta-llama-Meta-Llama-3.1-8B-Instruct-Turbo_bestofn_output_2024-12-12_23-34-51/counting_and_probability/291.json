    "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $7!$ and $(5!)^2$, we need to calculate both factorials and then find the factors they have in common.\n\n1. Calculate 7!:\n   $7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040$\n\n2. Calculate (5!)^2:\n   $5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$\n   $(5!)^2 = 120^2 = 14400$\n\n3. Now, we need to find the greatest common divisor of 5040 and 14400. \n\nTo find the GCD of 5040 and 14400, we can list their factors or use the prime factorization method.\n\nUsing prime factorization, we get:\n   For 5040: \n     $5040 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7$\n   For 14400:\n     $14400 = 2^6 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2$\n\nFrom the prime factorization, we can see that they share the common factors 3^2 (9) and 5.\n\nSo, multiplying the common factors 3^2 (9) and 5, we get the GCD.\n   $GCD = 9 \\times 5 = 45$\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of $7!$ and $(5!)^2$ is $\\boxed{45}$.",

Prime factorization of $14400$: \nWe can rewrite $14400$ as $2^6\\times 3^2\\times 5^2$.\n\nNow, to find the greatest common divisor, we take the lowest power of common prime factors in both numbers.

So, we take $5^1$.\n\nNow, we can find the greatest common divisor:\n$2^4\\times 3^2\\times 5^1 = 16\\times 9\\times 5 = 720.$\n\nTherefore, the GCD of $7!$ and $(5!)^2$ is $\\boxed{720}$.",

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I can see that Solutions 2 and 3 are incorrect. \n\nSolution 2 is incorrect because it takes the lowest power of common prime factors, but it doesn't consider the prime factor 7 in 7!.
