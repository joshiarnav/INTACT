    "To find the probability of William getting at least one of the final four questions right, we can first find the probability of him getting none of them right and then subtract that from 1.\n\nSince each question has five answer choices and he is guessing randomly, the probability of him getting a single question wrong is 4/5.\n\nThe probability of him getting all four questions wrong is the product of the probability of getting each question wrong, which is (4/5)^4.\n\nWe can calculate this as:\n(4/5)^4 = 256/625\n\nSo, the probability of William getting all four questions wrong is 256/625.\n\nTo find the probability of him getting at least one of them right, we subtract this from 1:\n1 - 256/625 = 369/625\n\nTherefore, the probability that William will get at least one of these final four questions right is $\\boxed{\\frac{369}{625}}$.",
    "To find the probability that William gets at least one of the final four questions right, we can use the complement rule. This rule states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability that William gets all four questions wrong. \n\nFor each question, there are 5 answer choices, and William is guessing randomly. This means that the probability of getting the correct answer for any question is 1/5. \n\nThe probability of getting the correct answer is also 1 - probability of getting the wrong answer, which is 1 - 4/5 = 1/5.\n\nThe probability of getting all 4 questions wrong can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of getting each question wrong:\n\n(1/5) * (1/5) * (1/5) * (1/5) = 1/625.\n\nNow, we can use the complement rule to find the probability that William gets at least one question right:\n\nProbability of getting at least one right = 1 - Probability of getting all wrong\n= 1 - 1/625\n= 624/625\n\nSo, the probability that William will get at least one of the final four questions right is $\\boxed{624/625}$.",
    "To find the probability that William will get at least one of the final four questions right, we can use a complementary probability approach - find the probability of getting all questions wrong and then subtract that from 1.\n\nFor each question, there are 5 answer choices, and William guesses randomly. The probability of getting a question wrong is 4/5, since he has 4 incorrect choices out of 5.\n\nSince William guesses randomly for the last 4 questions, we need to calculate the probability of getting all 4 questions wrong. This probability is (4/5) * (4/5) * (4/5) * (4/5) = (4/5)^4.\n\nNow, calculate (4/5)^4:\n(4/5)^4 = 256/625\n\nThe probability of getting all 4 questions wrong is 256/625.\n\nThe probability of getting at least one question right is equal to 1 minus the probability of getting all questions wrong. So, the probability is 1 - 256/625.\n\nNow, let's calculate 1 - 256/625:\n1 - 256/625 = (625 - 256) / 625 = 369/625\n\nTherefore, the probability that William will get at least one of the final four questions right is 369/625, in the format:\n\n$\\boxed{369/625}$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They arrive at the same probability of 369/625 for William getting at least one of the final four questions right.\n\nHowever, Solution 1 is the most straightforward and easy to understand. It directly calculates the probability of getting all four questions wrong and then subtracts it from 1 to find the probability of getting at least one right.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "We find the probability that William misses the last four questions, and subtract from 1. The probability of William missing a question is $\\frac{4}{5}$, so the probability that he misses all four is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = \\frac{256}{625}$. The probability that he gets at least one right is $1-\\frac{256}{625} =\\boxed{\\frac{369}{625}}$.",
