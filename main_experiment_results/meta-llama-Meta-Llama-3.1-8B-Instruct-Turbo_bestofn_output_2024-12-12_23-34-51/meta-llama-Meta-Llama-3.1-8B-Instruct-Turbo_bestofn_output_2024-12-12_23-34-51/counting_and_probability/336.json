    "To find the number of positive multiples of 7 that end with the digit 3 and are less than 1000, we need to consider the multiples of 7 in the form $10n+3$, where $n$ is an integer. We can start from the smallest such multiple, which is 13, and look for the next multiples of 7 that end with the digit 3.\n\nTo do this systematically, we can start listing the multiples:\n- 13\n- 63\n- 113\n\nWe can see that the common difference between these numbers is 50, which is equal to 7 times 5, 10 times 5, and 5 times 10 and 14. However, since we are only adding $7\\cdot 5$ (35) to get a new number that is a multiple of 7 which also ends in a 3, the common difference is indeed 35.\n\nNext, we find the largest possible multiple of 7 that ends with 3 and is less than 1000. It can be found using the inequality $10n + 3 < 1000$:\n$10n < 997$\n$n < \\frac{997}{10}$\n$n < 99.7$\n\nHowever, we notice that 99.7 is not an integer. So we take the integer part, which is $n \\le 99$.\n\nHence, the last multiple we consider should be $10 \\cdot 99 + 3 = 993$. Now we found the first (13) and the last multiples (993). With the common difference 35, we can find how many multiples there are.\nWe can write the multiples of 7 that end with 3 as $13 + (i-1)35$, where $i$ can be any positive integer.\n\nWe want $13 + (i-1)35 \\le 993$, which gives us $n \\le 28.47$ (Not an integer). We can sum up all the numbers we found:\n$\\frac{993 - 13}{35} =  \\frac{980}{35} =  28$\n\nSo there are 28 positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3. \n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{28}$",
    "To find the number of positive multiples of $7$ that are less than $1000$ and end with the digit $3$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the pattern of multiples of $7$ ending in $3$: We know that the last digit of a multiple of $7$ can be $0$, $2$, $4$, $6$, or $8$. However, for multiples of $7$ ending in $3$, it will be $3$. These will follow a sequence of $$_{13}13+7n$$.\n\n2. Find the multiples of $13$ less than $\\frac{1000}{7}$ or simply $14\\frac{2}{7}$. The numerator has to be $4$ or less. Therefore, the numbers are $13 + 7n \\le 1000$. We know that $\\frac{1000}{7}$ is $142.\\overline{857142}$.\n\n3.  Since we want to ensure we include any numbers under $1000$, the last $13n+7$ we consider will be $13* 73 = 949$ since the following multiple $1096 = 13*85$. Hence we have $73$ multiples of $13$.\n\nAs a result, there are $\\boxed{73}$ positive multiples of $7$ that are less than $1000$ and end with the digit $3$.",
    "To find the positive multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3, we can start by understanding the pattern of multiples of 7 and the last digit.\n\nMultiples of 7 have a pattern in their last digit that repeats in cycles of 7: 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, and so on. The last digit 3 does not immediately appear in the first cycle. To find a multiple of 7 that ends in 3, we should start looking at multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and include 3 in their last digits.\n\nWe know that 21 and 98 are both multiples of 7, with 21 being the first multiple less than 100, 49 being the first multiple ending in 9 less than 100, thus we are looking for any multiple of 7 ending in 3 less than 1000.\n\nThe first few multiples that end in 3 are 63, 133, 203, 273, 343, 413, 483, 553, 623, 693, 763, 833, 903, 973. We find that the last multiple less than 1000 in this pattern is 973.\n\nWe notice that these numbers increase by 70: they have an increment of 70, because that is the cycle length between numbers ending in the same digit but are multiples of 7.\n\nSo to find the count of positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3, we should start from the first multiple 63 and divide 973 by the increment of 70."

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, let's analyze each solution for correctness.\n\nSolution 1: This solution is correct. It correctly identifies the common difference between the multiples of 7 that end with the digit 3 as 35. It also correctly finds the largest multiple of 7 that ends with 3 and is less than 1000 as 993. Finally, it correctly calculates the number of multiples as 28.\n\nSolution 2: This solution is incorrect. It incorrectly states that the multiples of 7 that end with 3 follow the sequence 13 + 7n. It also incorrectly calculates the number of multiples as 73.\n\nSolution 3: This solution is partially correct. It correctly identifies the pattern of multiples of 7 that end with 3 and the increment of 70 between them. However, it incorrectly calculates the number of multiples as 14.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best solution is Solution 1. Therefore, the index number of the best solution is 1.",
  "solution": "Listing the first 10 multiples of 7, which are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, we see that the only positive multiples of 7 that end in 3 are those that are the product of 7 and a number that ends in 9.  Therefore, the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3 are $7\\cdot 9 = 63$, $7\\cdot 19= 133$, $7\\cdot 29 = 203$, . . .  Notice that we can get from each to the next by adding $7\\cdot 10 = 70$, so our multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 are 63, 133, 203, . . ., 903, 973.  The last one is 910 more than the first. Since $910/70=13$, we see that we have taken 13 steps of 70 to get from the first number in the list to the last. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{14}$ numbers in the list.",
