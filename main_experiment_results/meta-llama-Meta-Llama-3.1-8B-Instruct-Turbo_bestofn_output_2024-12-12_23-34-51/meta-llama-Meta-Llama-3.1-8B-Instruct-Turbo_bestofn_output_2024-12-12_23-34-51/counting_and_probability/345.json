    "To find the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers selected from the first seven prime numbers is an even number, we need to consider the properties of even and odd numbers.\n\nThe first seven prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17. We know that 2 is the only even prime number.\n\nIf we select two distinct numbers from these seven, we can have the first number being 2 and any of the other 6 distinct numbers. This combination will give us an even sum because when we add 2 to any number, the result will be even. So, there are 6 possible combinations of this type.\n\nThe other combinations will be of two odd numbers. Since 3 and 5 and 7 and 11 and 13 and 17 are all odd, when we select two of them, the sum will be even. However, there is another way of selecting two even numbers to get an even number's sum.\n\nIf we take all the distinct pairs of numbers, we can make them congruent to $2 \\pmod {2}$. These will be the cases when we take two odd numbers, and when we take $2$ along with one more number. There are $7\\cdot 6/2 = 21$ such possible pairs of distinct numbers, because the order of choice of the first and second number matters here, and we divide the product by two to eliminate the duplicates.\n\nWhen we take two distinct odd numbers, there are $6\\cdot 5/2 = 15$ such possible pairs. \n\nWhen we take 2 and any other number, there are 6 such possible pairs.\n\nSo, the number of total such possible pairs where their sum is even is 21. And the probability that their sum is an even number is given by the ratio of the number of pairs with an even sum to the total number of pairs, which is $\\frac{21}{21} = 1.$",
    "To find the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers is an even number, we need to first find all the possible pairs of distinct numbers from the first seven prime numbers. \n\nThe first seven prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible sums:\n\n- Even sums can be obtained by adding two even numbers or two odd numbers.\n- Odd sums can only be obtained by adding an even number and an odd number.\n\nSince there is only one even prime number (2), the only way to obtain an odd sum is by selecting 2 and one of the odd prime numbers.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of possible pairs and the number of pairs with odd sums.\n\nThere are 7 prime numbers, and we need to choose two distinct numbers from them, so the total number of possible pairs is $\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \\frac{7*6}{2} = 21$.\n\nThe pairs with odd sums are those formed by choosing 2 with one of the other 6 prime numbers, which is $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$. \n\nTherefore, the probability that their sum is an even number is $\\frac{21-6}{21} = \\frac{15}{21} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n\nSo, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",
    "To find the probability, we need to identify the first seven prime numbers, determine the possible pairs, and count the pairs whose sum is an even number.\n\nThe first seven prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\nSince we're choosing two distinct numbers from these seven prime numbers, the total number of possible pairs is given by the combination formula $C(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items being chosen.\n\nHere, $n = 7$ and $r = 2$, so the total number of possible pairs is:\n$C(7, 2) = \\frac{7!}{2!5!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21$\n\nNow, let's consider the sum of even and odd numbers:\n- The sum of two even numbers is even.\n- The sum of two odd numbers is even.\n- The sum of an even number and an odd number is odd.\n\nFrom the first seven prime numbers, 2 is the only even prime number, while the rest are odd prime numbers. We need to count the pairs whose sum is even.\n\nThe pairs we can form with 2 are:\n- 2 and 3: sum is 5 (odd)\n- 2 and 5: sum is 7 (odd)\n- 2 and 7: sum is 9 (odd)\n- 2 and 11: sum is 13 (odd)\n- 2 and 13: sum is 15 (odd)\n- 2 and 17: sum is 19 (odd)\nThere are 6 odd sums here.\n\nWe now consider pairs formed from the remaining 6 odd prime numbers.\nWe can form $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ pairs of odd numbers. \n(For readers interested in basic probability an a convenient source of what is being measured: the $15$ pairs include:\n- 3 and 5: sum is 8 (even)\n- 3 and 7: sum is 10 (even)\n- 3 and 11: sum is 14 (even)\n- 3 and 13: sum is 16 (even)\n- 3 and 17: sum is 20 (even)\n- 5 and 7: sum is 12 (even)\n- 5 and 11: sum is 16 (even)\n- 5 and 13: sum is 18 (even)\n- 5 and 17: sum is 22 (even)\n- 7 and 11: sum is 18 (even)\n- 7 and 13: sum is 20 (even)\n- 7 and 17: sum is 24 (even)\n- 11 and 13: sum is 24 (even)\n- 11 and 17: sum is 28 (even)\n- 13 and 17: sum is 30 (even))\n\nSo the sum of the 14 pairs of odd numbers we've counted here is an even number - 14, the count, being half of the 28 the other 14 are odd sum of pairs. \n\nIn total, we have 14 pairs out of 21 whose sum is an even number.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of two randomly selected distinct prime numbers from the first seven prime numbers is an even number is:\n$\\frac{\\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{total number of possible outcomes}} = \\frac{14}{21}$\n\nNow we simplify this:\nSince 21 is a multiple of 7 (21 = 7 * 3), the 7 in the numerator and denominator can be canceled out, which simplifies the fraction:\n$\\frac{\\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{total number of possible outcomes}} = \\frac{2}{3}$"

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I can confirm that Solution 2 is the best one.\n\nSolution 1 is incorrect because it incorrectly calculates the total number of pairs and also misinterprets the concept of even and odd sums.\n\nSolution 3 is also incorrect because it incorrectly counts the number of pairs with even sums and also incorrectly simplifies the fraction.\n\nSolution 2 is correct because it accurately calculates the total number of pairs and correctly counts the number of pairs with even sums.

  "solution": "The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2. There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$.
