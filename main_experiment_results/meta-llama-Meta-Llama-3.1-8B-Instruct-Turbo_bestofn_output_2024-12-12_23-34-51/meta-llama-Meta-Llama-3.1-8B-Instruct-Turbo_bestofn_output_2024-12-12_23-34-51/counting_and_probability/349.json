    "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of binomial distribution. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes when flipping 8 coins. Since each coin has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails), the total number of possible outcomes is $2^8 = 256$.\n\nTo find the probability of getting more heads than tails, we need to find the number of outcomes where we get more heads than tails, and then divide it by the total number of outcomes.\n\nLet's count the number of outcomes where we get more heads than tails:\n\n*   We can get $5, 6, 7,$ or $8$ heads.\n*   Since the probability of getting $H$ heads and $T$ tails is $\\binom{8}{H}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^H\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^T = \\binom{8}{H}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^8$ (since $H+1+T=8$), we can use the formula to calculate the probabilities:\n*   For 5 heads: $\\binom{8}{5}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^8$\n*   For 6 heads: $\\binom{8}{6}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^8$\n*   For 7 heads: $\\binom{8}{7}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^8$\n*   For 8 heads: $\\binom{8}{8}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^8$\n\nHowever, since there's no need to simplify with the combinations, we can directly multiply $\\binom{8}{x} \\times (\\frac{1}{2})^8$. But for ease of calculation, let's use a simplified approach and look at total successful combinations where the number of heads is more than tails:\n$\\binom{8}{5}+\\binom{8}{6}+\\binom{8}{7}+\\binom{8}{8}$\n= 56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 93\nTherefore, the probability of getting more heads than tails is $\\frac{93}{256}$",
    "To find the probability that Anna gets more heads than tails when she flips 8 coins, we need to count the number of successful outcomes (more heads than tails) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nStep 1: First, let's find the total number of possible outcomes.

    "To solve this problem, let's first consider the total possible outcomes when flipping 8 coins. Each coin can either land heads (H) or tails (T), so there are 2 possible outcomes for each coin. With 8 coins, the total number of possible outcomes is:\n\n2^8 = 256\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where Anna gets more heads than tails. This can happen in 5, 6, 7, or 8 ways.\n\n- For 5 heads, the number of ways is C(8, 5), where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient, representing the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements. So, C(8, 5) = 8! / (5! * (8 - 5)!) = 56.\n- For 6 heads, C(8, 6) = 28.\n- For 7 heads, C(8, 7) = 8.\n- For 8 heads, C(8, 8) = 1.\n\nWe add these up to get the total number of outcomes where Anna gets more heads than tails:\n\n56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 93\n\nThe probability of getting more heads than tails is then:\n\n93 / 256 \u2248 0.3633\n\nTo be more precise, we can leave the answer as a fraction:\n\n93 / 256 \n\nHowever, to match the required format, we can convert it to decimal form with some rounding for the sake of it and consider it \u201cin the form requested\u201d since the problem actually asks for a boxed answer which should be in the exact numeric format provided in \u201canswer\u201d.

  "solution": "We could solve this problem using casework, but using a little bit of symmetry and complementary probability gives us a more elegant solution. Since each coin flips heads and tails with equal probability, by the principle of symmetry the probability of getting more heads than tails is the equal to the probability of getting more tails than heads. Additionally, there are only three possible outcomes: getting more heads than tails, getting more tails than heads, or getting the same number of both. If we let $x$ represent the probability of the first outcome (which is the same as the probability of the second outcome) and $y$ represent the probability of the third outcome, we get the equation $2x + y = 1 \\Rightarrow x=\\dfrac{1-y}{2}$. So all we need to do is calculate the probability of getting the same number of heads and tails and we can then easily solve for what we want using the principle of complementary probability. Since there are two equally likely outcomes for each flip, there are a total of $2^8$ equally likely possible outcomes for flipping the 8 coins. We will have the same number of both heads and tails if we have exactly 4 of each, which we can count by selecting 4 out of the 8 flips to be heads which can occur in $\\binom{8}{4}=70$ ways. So $y=\\dfrac{70}{256}=\\dfrac{35}{128}$, and substituting that back into our first equation gives us the probability that we want: $x=\\boxed{\\dfrac{93}{256}}$.",
