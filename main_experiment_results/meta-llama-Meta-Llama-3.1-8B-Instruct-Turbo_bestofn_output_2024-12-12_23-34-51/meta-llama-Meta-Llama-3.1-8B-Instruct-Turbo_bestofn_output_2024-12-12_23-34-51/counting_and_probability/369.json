    "To solve this problem, we will use combinations, which represents the number of ways to choose a certain number of items from a larger set without regard to order.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8.\nWe can use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nFor Republicans: C(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n= 8! / (3!5!)\n= (8*7*6) / (3*2*1)\n= 56\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 Democrats from 6.\nUsing the same combination formula:\nFor Democrats: C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!)\n= 6! / (2!4!)\n= (6*5) / (2*1)\n= 15\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of ways to form the subcommittee.\nSince the choice of Republicans and Democrats is independent, we can multiply the number of ways to choose each group to get the total number of ways.\nTotal ways = C(8, 3) * C(6, 2) = 56 * 15\n= 840\n\nSo, there are 840 ways to form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats.\n\n$\\boxed{840}$",
    "To find the total number of ways to form the subcommittee, we need to consider the combinations for the Republicans and Democrats separately.\n\nFor the Republicans, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 out of 8.  This is a combination, and can be calculated using the formula:\n\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, r is the number of items being chosen, and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g. 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120).\n\nSo, for the Republicans, we have:\n8C3 = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!)\n= 8! / (3! * 5!)\n= (8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(5*4*3*2*1))\n= (8*7*6) / (3*2*1)\n= 56\n\nFor the Democrats, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 out of 6.  This is another combination, which can be calculated using the same formula:\n\n6C2 = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!)\n= 6! / (2! * 4!)\n= (6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((2*1)*(4*3*2*1))\n= (6*5) / (2)\n= 15\n\nSince these choices are independent (i.e. we can choose the Republicans in any way, and then choose the Democrats in any way), we can multiply the two numbers together to get the total number of possible combinations.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to form the subcommittee is:\n56 * 15 = 840\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{840}$.",
    "To form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8 and 2 Democrats from 6.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8. This is a combination problem, and we can use the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nFor Republicans, we have:\nn = 8 (total Republicans)\nk = 3 (Republicans to choose)\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n= 8! / (3!5!)\n= (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1)(5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n= (40320) / ((6)(120))\n= 40320 / 720\n= 56\n\nSo, there are 56 ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of ways to choose 2 Democrats from 6:\nn = 6 (total Democrats)\nk = 2 (Democrats to choose)\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!)\n= 6! / (2!4!)\n= (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1)(4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n= (720) / ((2)(24))\n= 720 / 48\n= 15\n\nSo, there are 15 ways to choose 2 Democrats from 6.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats to get the total number of ways to form a subcommittee:\n\nTotal ways = C(8, 3) * C(6, 2)\n= 56 * 15\n= 840\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats is 840.\n\n$\\boxed{840}$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They use the combination formula to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8 and 2 Democrats from 6, and then multiply these numbers together to get the total number of ways to form a subcommittee.\n\nHowever, Solution 1 is the most concise and straightforward, with a clear step-by-step explanation of the calculation process. It is also the most easily readable and understandable.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "There are 8 Republicans and 3 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ ways to choose the Republicans.  There are 6 Democrats and 2 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose the Democrats.  So there are $56 \\times 15 = \\boxed{840}$ ways to choose the subcommittee.",
