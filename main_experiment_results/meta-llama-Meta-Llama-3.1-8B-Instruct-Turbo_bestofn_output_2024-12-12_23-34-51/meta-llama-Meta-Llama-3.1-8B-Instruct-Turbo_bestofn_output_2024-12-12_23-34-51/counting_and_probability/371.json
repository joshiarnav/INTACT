    "To find the number of ways to put 5 indistinguishable balls in 3 distinguishable boxes, we can use the concept of \"stars and bars.\" \n\nImagine the 5 balls as stars and the 2 bars that separate the boxes as, well, bars. The task is to distribute the 5 stars among the 3 boxes, separated by 2 bars. \n\nFor example, one possible distribution is ***|*|**, representing 3 balls in the first box, 1 ball in the second box, and 1 ball in the third box.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange 5 stars and 2 bars can be calculated using the formula: \n\n(5 + 2) choose 2\n= 7 choose 2\n= (7 * 6) / (2 * 1)\n= 21\n\nSo, there are $\\boxed{21}$ ways to put 5 indistinguishable balls in 3 distinguishable boxes.",
    "To find the number of ways to put 5 indistinguishable balls in 3 distinguishable boxes, we can use a \"stars and bars\" approach.\n\nImagine we have 5 stars (to represent the balls) and 2 bars (to separate the boxes). The stars and bars can be arranged in various ways, and each unique arrangement represents a way to distribute the balls.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- Each star represents a ball.\n- Each row of bars divides the stars into different boxes.\n- The number of stars between bars represents the number of balls in each box.\n\nFor example, if we have 3 stars and 2 bars, one possible arrangement could be:\n\n```\n***|*||*\n```\n\nThis represents the following distribution: Box 1 has 3 balls, Box 2 has 1 ball, and Box 3 is empty.\n\nTo generate all possible arrangements, we need to choose the positions of the 2 bars among the 7 total positions (5 stars + 2 bars). This can be calculated using combinations:\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 7 is C(7, 2), which is calculated as:\n\nC(7, 2) = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1) = 21\n\nSo, there are 21 different ways to put 5 indistinguishable balls in 3 distinguishable boxes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n\n$\\boxed{21}$",
    "To solve this problem, we need to use a method called \"stars and bars\" or \"combinations with repetition.\" This method involves using a sequence of stars (*) to represent the balls and a bar (|) to separate the boxes.\n\nWe have 5 balls and want to put them in 3 boxes, so we will represent this as a sequence of 5 stars.\n\nNow, the bars will separate the boxes. There are 2 bars (one between the first two boxes and one between the second and third box) because there are 2 divisions.\n\nSo the total sequence will have 7 elements: 5 stars and 2 bars.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the 5 stars and 2 bars is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 7 for the bars.\n\nThis is a combination problem and can be solved using the formula for combinations: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!), where n is the total number of elements and k is the number of elements to choose.\n\nIn this case, we have 7 total elements (5 stars + 2 bars) and we want to choose 2 positions for the bars.\n\nSo, using the combination formula:\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7-2)!)\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * 5!)\nC(7, 2) = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1)\nC(7, 2) = 21\n\nTherefore, there are 21 ways to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable but the boxes are.\n\n$\\boxed{21}$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They use the concept of \"stars and bars\" to calculate the number of ways to put 5 indistinguishable balls in 3 distinguishable boxes.\n\nHowever, I will analyze each solution for clarity, concision, and overall quality. \n\nSolution 1 is clear and concise, but it only provides one example of how to distribute the balls. \n\nSolution 2 is also clear and concise, but it uses the same example as Solution 1.\n\nSolution 3 is the most detailed and provides a clear explanation of the \"stars and bars\" method. It also uses the combination formula to calculate the number of ways to arrange the stars and bars.\n\nBased on clarity, concision, and overall quality, I would select Solution 3 as the best solution.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 3",
  "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of balls in the different boxes.\n\nThere are $3$ ways to arrange the balls as $(5,0,0)$ (specifically, box 1 can have 5, box 2 can have 5, box 3 can have 5).\n\nThere are $3! = 6$ to arrange $(4,1,0)$ and $3! = 6$ ways to arrange $(3,2,0)$; in each case, we must choose one of the 3 boxes to have the largest number of balls, and also one of the remaining two boxes to be left empty.\n\nHowever, there are only $3$ ways to arrange $(3,1,1)$, and $3$ ways to arrange $(2,2,1)$; in each case, we must choose one box to have the `different' number of balls (3 in the $(3,1,1)$ case and 1 in the $(2,2,1)$ case).\n\nThis gives a total of $3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = \\boxed{21}$ arrangements.",
