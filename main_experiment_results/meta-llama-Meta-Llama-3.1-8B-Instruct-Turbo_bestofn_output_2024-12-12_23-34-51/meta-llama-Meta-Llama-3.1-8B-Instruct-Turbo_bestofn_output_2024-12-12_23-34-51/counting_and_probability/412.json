    "To find the number of distinct triangles that can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. A cube has 8 vertices, and we need to choose 3 of them to form a triangle. \n\n2. We can think of this as a combination problem, as the order of the chosen vertices does not matter.\n\n3. The formula for combinations is C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items being chosen.\n\n4. In this case, n = 8 and r = 3.\n\n5. Applying the formula, we get: C(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!)\n   = 8! / (3! * 5!)\n   = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n   = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n   = 336 / 6\n   = 56\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n$\\boxed{56}$",

    "To find the number of distinct triangles that can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the cube's structure**: A cube has 8 vertices. We can visualize these vertices as points in 3D space.\n\n2. **Choosing the first vertex**: We can choose any of the 8 vertices as the first vertex of the triangle. In other words, we have 8 choices for the first vertex.\n\n3. **Choosing the second vertex**: After choosing the first vertex, we need to choose the second vertex. Since the second vertex must be different from the first vertex, we have 7 remaining choices for the second vertex.\n\n4. **Choosing the third vertex**: After choosing the first and second vertices, we need to choose the third vertex. Since the third vertex must be different from the first two vertices, we have 6 remaining choices for the third vertex.\n\n5. **Counting the distinct triangles**: However, we need to account for the fact that the order of choosing the vertices does not matter. That is, choosing vertices A, B, and C is the same as choosing vertices C, B, and A. To avoid counting the same triangle multiple times, we will use the concept of combinations.\n\n6. **Using combinations**: The number of ways to choose 3 vertices out of 8 without considering the order is given by the combination formula:\n\n    C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\n    In this case, n = 8 (the total number of vertices) and r = 3 (the number of vertices to choose for each triangle).\n\n    So, the number of distinct triangles is:\n\n    C(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n             = 8! / (3! * 5!)\n             = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n             = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n             = 56\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct triangles that can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube is $\\boxed{56}$."
