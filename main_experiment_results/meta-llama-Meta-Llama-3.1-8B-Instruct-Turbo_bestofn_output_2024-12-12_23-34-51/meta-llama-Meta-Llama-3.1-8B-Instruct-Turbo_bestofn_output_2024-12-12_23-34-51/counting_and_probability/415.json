    "To find the probability that the number selected is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube, we need to find the total count of numbers that are not perfect squares or perfect cubes.\n\nFirst, let's find the count of perfect squares from 1 to 150. We know that $\\sqrt{150} < 13$. Therefore, there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150.\n\nNext, let's find the count of perfect cubes from 1 to 150. The largest perfect cube less than or equal to 150 is $5^3 = 125$. Therefore, there are 5 perfect cubes from 1 to 150.\n\nHowever, there are 2 numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes: $1^6 = 1$ and $2^6 = 64$. We need to subtract these 2 numbers from the total count to avoid double-counting.\n\nNow, let's find the count of numbers that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes. We have 12 perfect squares and 5 perfect cubes, but we subtract 2 numbers that are counted twice. The count is $12 + 5 - 2 = 15$.\n\nTo find the count of numbers that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes, we subtract the count from the total count. There are 150 numbers in total, so the count of numbers that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes is $150 - 15 = 135$.\n\nNow, let's find the probability. The probability is the count of favorable outcomes divided by the total count of outcomes. The count of favorable outcomes is 135, and the total count of outcomes is 150. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{135}{150}$.\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15. The simplified fraction is $\\frac{9}{10}$. \n\nSo, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",
    "To find the probability of randomly selecting a number from 1 to 150 that is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube, we will proceed step by step.\n\n1. **List the perfect squares**: We start by listing the perfect squares between 1 and 150. The perfect squares in the given range are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, and 144. There are 12 perfect squares.\n\n2. **List the perfect cubes**: Next, we list the perfect cubes between 1 and 150. The perfect cubes in the given range are 1, 8, 27, 64, and 125. There are 5 perfect cubes.\n\n3. **Identify overlapping perfect squares and cubes**: We note that 1 and 64 are both a perfect square and a perfect cube. We need to account for this to avoid double counting.\n\n4. **Count the total numbers**: From 1 to 150, there are 150 numbers.\n\n5. **Count the numbers that are perfect squares or perfect cubes**: We found that there are 12 perfect squares and 5 perfect cubes, but we counted 2 numbers twice. Therefore, the total number of perfect squares or perfect cubes is 17 (12 + 5 - 2).\n\n6. **Calculate the probability**: We want to find the probability that the selected number is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube. Therefore, we need to find the probability that it is a perfect square or a perfect cube. The probability of being a perfect square or a perfect cube is $\\frac{17}{150}$.\n\n7. **Calculate the probability of being neither**: To find the probability of being neither, we subtract the probability of being a perfect square or a perfect cube from 1: \n\\[1-\\frac{17}{150}=\\frac{150-17}{150}=\\frac{133}{150}.\\]\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{133}{150}}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of numbers from 1 to 150 that are not perfect squares or perfect cubes, and then divide that by the total number of possible outcomes (which is 150 in this case).\n\nFirst, let's find the number of perfect squares from 1 to 150. To do this, we can find the largest perfect square that is less than or equal to 150. We can calculate this by taking the square root of 150, which is approximately 12.25. So the largest perfect square less than or equal to 150 is $12^2=144$. Therefore, there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150.\n\nNext, let's find the number of perfect cubes from 1 to 150. To do this, we can find the largest perfect cube that is less than or equal to 150. We can calculate this by taking the cube root of 150, which is approximately 5.31. So the largest perfect cube less than or equal to 150 is $5^3=125$. Therefore, there are 5 perfect cubes from 1 to 150.\n\nHowever, in this range, some numbers are both perfect squares and perfect cubes (for example, $1^6=1^2=1$ and $2^6=2^3=8$), so we can't simply add the number of perfect squares and perfect cubes. We must first remove the numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes. The first number that is both in this sequence is $2^6=8\\leq 150$, and the last is $5^6=156>150$; therefore, the numbers in the given sequence are from $2^6$ to $5^6$. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of perfect sixth powers that are less than or equal to 150. We can calculate this by taking the sixth root of 150, which is approximately 1.87. So the largest perfect sixth power less than or equal to 150 is $1^6=1$ and $2^6=8$; therefore the numbers that are both are 2.\n\nNow, let's add the number of perfect squares and perfect cubes, then subtract the number of perfect sixth powers from that total. We get 17 numbers.\n\nWe need to find the number of numbers from 1 to 150 that are not perfect squares or perfect cubes. We can do this by subtracting the number of perfect squares or perfect cubes from the total number of numbers from 1 to 150. This gives us $150 - 17 = 133$ numbers that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes.\n\nNow we need to find the probability of selecting a perfect square or perfect cube. We can do this by dividing the number of perfect squares or perfect cubes by the total number of numbers from 1 to 150. This gives us: \n$\\frac{17}{150}$\n\nTo find the probability that a number is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube, we need to subtract the probability that it is a perfect square or perfect cube from 1. This gives us:\n$\\frac{150}{150} - \\frac{17}{150}$ \n\n$\\frac{133}{150}$ \n\nSo, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{133}{150}}$."

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I found that all three solutions arrive at the same correct answer, which is $\\frac{133}{150}$. However, Solution 2 has a minor error in the final calculation of the probability. It calculates the probability of being a perfect square or a perfect cube, but then subtracts this probability from 1 to find the probability of being neither. This is incorrect because the probability of being a perfect square or a perfect cube is not the same as 1 minus the probability of being neither. \n\nHowever, Solution 2 is the most straightforward and easy-to-understand solution. It explicitly lists the perfect squares and perfect cubes and identifies the overlap, making it easier to follow. Solution 1 and Solution 3 are also correct, but they are more complicated.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 2",
  "solution": "It is easier to count the number of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. We see there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150, namely $1^{2}, 2^{2}, \\ldots, 12^{2}$, and there are 5 perfect cubes, namely $1^{3}, \\ldots, 5^{3}$. Then notice there are two repetitions, $1^{6} =1^2 = 1^3 = 1$ and $2^{6} = 8^2 = 4^3 = 64$. So there is a total of $12+5-2=15$ integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Thus, we get $150-15=135$ integers from 1 to 150 that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes. So the probability that we select such a number is $\\frac{135}{150} = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",
