    "To solve this problem, let's analyze the given digits and the conditions:\n\n- We have four digits in total, but they are repeated twice (two 2's and two 9's).\n- We need to form a four-digit positive integer using these digits.\n\nSince we have repeated digits, we need to divide the total number of permutations by the factorial of the repeated digits to avoid overcounting.\n\nThe total number of digits is 4. If all digits were unique, the total number of possible arrangements would be 4! (4 factorial).\n\nHowever, we have two pairs of identical digits (two 2's and two 9's). To correct for overcounting, we divide by the factorial of the count of each pair of identical digits, which is 2! for the two 2's and 2! for the two 9's.\n\nSo, the total number of different positive four-digit integers that can be formed is given by:\n\n4! / (2! * 2!)\n\n= (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\n\n= 24 / (2 * 2)\n\n= 24 / 4\n\n= 6\n\nTherefore, the number of different positive four-digit integers that can be formed is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "To find the total number of different positive four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Selecting the digits:** We have 4 digits to choose from, but two of them (2 and 2, 9 and 9) are repeated. This changes the way we calculate the permutation.\n\n2. **Choosing the positions for the '2's:** We can choose the position for the first '2' in 4 ways. The second '2' can be placed in 3 remaining ways (since we can't place it in the same position). So, the total number of ways to choose the position for the '2's is 4 * 3 = 12.\n\n3. **Choosing the positions for the '9's**: By similar reasoning, for the '9's, we have 2 ways to choose the position for the first '9', since for 2 positions, the '9' can only be placed for the remaining. The second '9' has then only 1 remaining position. Thus, the total number of ways to choose the position for the '9's is 2 * 1 = 2.\n\n4. **Dividing the total by repeated arrangements:** When you multiply these numbers, we get 12 * 2 = 24. However, for every of these permutations, we could swap the two identical '2's and the two identical '9's with each other, respectively.\n\n\n\nSo we have to divide by the number of internal permutations, which is the number of ways you can swap the two '2's and the two '9's. That is, 2! * 2!, or 4, so the total is 24 / 4 = 6.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "To find the total number of different positive four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9, we can break this down step by step.\n\nStep 1: If all the digits were unique, there would be 4! = 24 possible arrangements.\n\nHowever, we have two pairs of repeated digits (two 2s and two 9s). \n\nStep 2: When we have repeated elements, we need to account for the identical arrangements. \n\nFor the digit '2', there are 4 positions where we can place it. After placing one '2', there are 3 possible positions left for the second '2'. We have 6 possible positions left for either '9'. And then one '9' remains in one of 4 positions. However, since the two '2's are identical and the two '9's are identical, we have to correct for this overcount by dividing by 2! (for the two '2's) and again by 2! (for the two '9's).\n\nSo, the correct number of possible arrangements is (4 * 3 * 6 * 4) / (2! * 2!) = (144) / (4) = 36.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different positive, four-digit integers that can be formed is $\\boxed{36}$."

  "solution": "We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting. That is, if we had 4 distinct digits, there would be $4! = 24$ orderings. However, we must divide by 2! once for the repetition of the digit 2, and divide by 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digit were different we would have twice as many orderings). So, our answer is $\\frac{4!}{2!\\cdot 2!} = 2 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{6}$.",
