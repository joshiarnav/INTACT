    "To solve this problem, let's break down the steps and consider different cases.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of three-digit numbers (from 100 to 999). There are 900 such numbers in this range (999 - 100 + 1 = 900).\n\nNow, let's consider the three-digit numbers we want to exclude, i.e., the ones in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent. The following list captures these cases.\n\n- 111: There is 1 such number.\n- 222: There is 1 such number.\n- 333: There is 1 such number.\n- 444: There is 1 such number.\n- 555: There is 1 such number.\n- 666: There is 1 such number.\n- 777: There is 1 such number.\n- 888: There is 1 such number.\n- 999: There is 1 such number.\n\nThere are 9 numbers of this form.\n\nHowever, there are three-digit numbers in the form of AAA (where A is a 1-digit number),  but this particular condition was  not applicable. Since we knew A could range from 1 to 9, there would be 9 such results  (We need $A\\not=0$  but for this condition  we were told  A was 1  digit and  also we cannot have  the A  range from 1-9  both  for this differnt condition,  rather we would  range A  $1- 9$.\n\nNow that we know this we have 9  results:  we cannot have  the A  range from 1-9  both  for this differnt differnt condition, the results we get  range from  $101  to   $ 999.\n\nThere are indeed 999  -  101 +1.",
    "To solve this problem, we'll count the total number of three-digit numbers and then exclude the numbers that don't meet the conditions.\n\nStep 1: Count the total number of three-digit numbers. \n\n- The smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999.\n- For each digit, we have 10 options (0-9).\n- However, the first digit can't be 0, so we have 9 options for the first digit and 10 options for each of the other digits.\n- Therefore, the total number of three-digit numbers is 9 * 10 * 10 = 900.\n\nStep 2: Count the number of three-digit numbers that have exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent.\n\n- Let's say the first two digits are the same, and the third digit is different.\n- For the repeated digit, we have 9 options (because it can't be the same as the third digit).\n- For the third digit, we have 9 options (because it can't be the same as the repeated digit).\n- So, in this case, we have 9 * 9 = 81 numbers.\n- However, this count includes cases where the repeated digit is 0. Since the first digit can't be 0, we need to consider these cases separately.\n- If the repeated digit is 0, then the third digit must be 1-9 (9 options).\n- So, the number of cases where the repeated digit is 0 is 1 (for the hundreds digit) * 9 (for the third digit) = 9.\n- Therefore, the total number of three-digit numbers that have exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent, is 81 - 9 = 72.\n\nStep 3: Subtract the count of numbers in step 2 from the total count in step 1.\n\n- 900 (total count) - 72 (count of numbers to exclude) = 828.\n\nTherefore, the number of three-digit numbers left is $\\boxed{828}$.",
    "To find the total number of three-digit numbers, first consider that a three-digit number can be expressed as 100a + 10b + c, where a is the first digit (it cannot be zero), b is the second digit, and c is the third digit.\n\nA three-digit number can have its first three digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Thus, a has 9 possibilities, b has 10 possibilities, and c also has 10 possibilities.\n\nThis gives the total number of three-digit numbers as 9 * 10 * 10 = 900.\n\nSo to solve our problem, we will first find the total number of three-digit numbers in which we have exactly two digits the same (but these two digits are not adjacent). \n\nLet's denote these three-digit numbers as the form 100 a + 10 a + c, where a cannot be 0, and c represents a different digit.\n\nFor c (last digit) we have 9 possibilities (0 is excluded), and we will also calculate a.\n\nHence a has 9 possibilities, and we will also calculate c, as it can be any number 0 - 9 (excluding a).\n\nHence the total three-digit numbers in which exactly two digits the same (but these two digits are not adjacent) is 9 * 9 = 81.\n\nTo find the three-digit numbers in which we have exactly two digits the same (but these two digits are not adjacent) in a three digit numbers which we have to look out for, the total of  three-digit numbers will be  900 - 81 = 819.\n\nHence we have,\n\\boxed{819}"

  "critique": "Let's analyze each solution for correctness:\n\nSolution 1: This solution has a few issues. It correctly calculates the total number of three-digit numbers but incorrectly identifies the numbers to exclude. It includes numbers in the form of AAA, which are not excluded. It also incorrectly calculates the number of excluded numbers as 9.\n\nSolution 2: This solution is correct. It correctly calculates the total number of three-digit numbers and the number of three-digit numbers that have exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent. It then subtracts the count of numbers to exclude from the total count to get the correct answer.\n\nSolution 3: This solution is also correct. It correctly calculates the total number of three-digit numbers and the number of three-digit numbers that have exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent. It then subtracts the count of numbers to exclude from the total count to get the correct answer.\n\nHowever, Solution 2 is more detailed and accurate in its explanation.

  "solution": "The only three digit numbers which are ruled out are numbers of the form $ABA$, where A and B are different digits. There are 9 ways to choose A, since it can't be 0, and once A has been chosen there are 9 ways to choose B.
