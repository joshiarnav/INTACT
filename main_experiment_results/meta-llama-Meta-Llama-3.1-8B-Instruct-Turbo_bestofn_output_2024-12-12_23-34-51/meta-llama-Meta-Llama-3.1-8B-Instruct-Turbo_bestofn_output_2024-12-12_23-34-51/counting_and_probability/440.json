    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the region where $x+y \\le 4$ and then divide it by the total area of the region.\n\nStep 1: Find the total area of the region. The region is a rectangle with $x$-length of 3 and $y$-length of 6. The area of a rectangle is length times width, so the total area is $3 \\times 6 = 18$.\n\nStep 2: Find the area of the region where $x+y \\le 4$. To do this, we can graph the line $x+y = 4$. The line will intersect the $y$-axis at $y = 4$ and the top of the rectangle at $y = 3$.\n\nThe region where $x+y \\le 4$ is a trapezoid with two parallel sides of length 1 and 4 (the horizontal distances from the line to the $y$-axis) and a height of 3 (the vertical distance from the line to the top of the rectangle).\n\nThe area of a trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}h(b_1 + b_2)$, where $h$ is the height, $b_1$ is the length of one of the parallel sides, and $b_2$ is the length of the other parallel side. In this case, $h = 3$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 4$. So, the area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times (1 + 4) = \\frac{15}{2}$.\n\nStep 3: Find the probability. To do this, we divide the area of the region where $x+y \\le 4$ by the total area of the region.\n\nProbability = $\\frac{\\text{area of the region where } x+y \\le 4}{\\text{total area of the region}} = \\frac{\\frac{15}{2}}{18} = \\frac{15}{36} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\n\nSo, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{12}}$.",
    "To find the probability that $x+y \\le 4$, we need to find the area of the region where $x+y \\le 4$ and divide it by the total area.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the region in the given coordinate system. The inequality $x+y \\le 4$ represents a line and the area below it.\n\nThe total area can be found by multiplying the length and width of the rectangle in which the point is selected: $3 \\times 6 = 18$.\n\nNow, we need to find the area of the region where $x+y \\le 4$. The line $x+y = 4$ intersects the $x$-axis when $y = 0$, so $x = 4$. However, since $0 \\le x \\le 3$, we only consider the $x$-values up to 3. This line also intersects the $y$-axis when $x = 0$, so $y = 4$. However, since $0 \\le y \\le 6$, we only consider the $y$-values up to 4.\n\nThis forms a trapezoid within the rectangle. The length of the shorter base is 4 (from $x=0$ to $x=0+1$), and the length of the longer base is 1 (from $x=3$ to $x=3-1$), and the height of the trapezoid is 3.\n\nThe formula for finding the area of a trapezoid is $\\frac{h(b_1 + b_2)}{2}$.\n\nSubstitute $b_1 = 4$, $b_2 = 1$, and $h = 3$.\n\n$\\frac{h(b_1 + b_2)}{2} = \\frac{3 \\times (4 + 1)}{2} = \\frac{3 \\times 5}{2} = \\frac{15}{2}$.\n\nNow, we can find the probability by dividing the area of the region where $x+y \\le 4$ by the total area.\n\n$P(x+y \\le 4) = \\frac{\\text{area of trapezoid}}{\\text{total area}}$\n\n$P(x+y \\le 4) = \\frac{\\frac{15}{2}}{18}$\n\n$P(x+y \\le 4) = \\frac{\\frac{15}{2}}{18} = \\frac{\\frac{15}{2}}{\\frac{18}{1}}$\n\n$P(x+y \\le 4) = \\frac{15}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{18}$\n\n$P(x+y \\le 4) = \\frac{15}{36}$\n\n$P(x+y \\le 4) = \\frac{\\frac{15}{1}}{\\frac{36}{1}}$\n\n$P(x+y \\le 4) = \\frac{15}{36}$\n\nDivide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.\n\n$P(x+y \\le 4) = \\frac{\\frac{15}{3}}{\\frac{36}{3}}$\n\n$P(x+y \\le 4) = \\frac{5}{12}$.",
    "To find the probability that $x+y \\le 4$, we first need to visualize the given region. The region is a rectangle with vertices $(0,0), (3,0), (0,6),$ and $(3,6)$. The condition $x+y \\le 4$ represents a line $y = -x + 4$, which divides the rectangle into two parts. We are interested in the part of the rectangle that satisfies $x+y \\le 4$.\n\nThis line intersects the rectangle at point $(3,1)$ and $(0,4)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the area of the region that satisfies $x+y \\le 4$. This region is a trapezoid with vertices $(0,0), (0,4), (3,1),$ and $(3,0)$.\n\nThe height of the smaller end of the trapezoid is $1$, and the height of the larger end of the trapezoid is $4$. The base of the trapezoid is $3$. \n\nWe can calculate the area of this region as follows:\nArea = (1/2) \u00d7 (base1 + base2) \u00d7 (height1 + height2)\nSince base1 is 4 and base2 is 1 this can be written as:\n= (1/2) \u00d7 (4 + 1) \u00d7 (1 + 4)\nThe formula can be simplified to \n= (1/2) \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5\nThis can be simplified further to\n= (5/2) \u00d7 5 \n= (5/2) \u00d7 (10/2)\n= (5 \u00d7 10) / (2 \u00d7 2)\n= (50/4) / 1\n= 50/4 = 25/2\n\nHowever we need the area of the entire rectangle which has a base of 3 and height of 6.\nArea of the rectangle = base \u00d7 height\n= 3 \u00d7 6 \n= (3 \u00d7 6) / 1\n= 18\n\nNow, we can find the probability by dividing the area of the trapezoid by the area of the rectangle:\nProbability = Area of trapezoid / Area of rectangle\n= (25/2) / 18\n= 25/2 \u00d7 9 / 9 \n= (25/2) \u00d7 (9/9)\n= (25 \u00d7 9) / (2 \u00d7 9)\n= 25/2 \nNow, let's get a common denominator between 9 and 2 which is 18.\nProbability = (25 \u00d7 9) / (2 \u00d7 9)\n= 225 / 18 can be simplified into a common denominator 18.\nProbability = 225 / 18 =  (225/18) / (18/18)\nThis can be written as 225 / 18 \u00d7 18 / 18 which is \n(225 \u00d7 18) / ( 18 \u00d7 18)\nThe denominator becomes 18 \u00d7 18 which is the 18 is multiplied by 18 and results in 324.\nSo this becomes\n= (225 \u00d7 18) / 324 = 225 \u00d7 18 / 324.\nNow let's get the 18 to be cancelled from both numerator and denominator\n\nThis can be achieved if 324 has 18 as a common factor of 324.\nFirst factorize 324 = 2 \u00d7 162 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 81 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3) \nThe 18 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3. In 324 this 18 factor is present.\n\"So now we can express 324 as (2 \u00d7 81) = (2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 27) = (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 9) = (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3) =  (2 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3)) = ( 3 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3)) \nSimplifying 324 into a factor of 18 this can also be written as (2 \u00d7 (9 \u00d7 9)) \nFactor out (18) from the denominator, this can also be written as\n= 225 \u00d7  (2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3) /\n\nThe final answer can also be written as\n=225 \u00d7 ( ( 2 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 3 ) /  ( 2 \u00d7 (9 \u00d7 9))\n\"So it now becomes\n= 225 \u00d7 ( ( 3 \u00d7 6 ) /  ( 2 \u00d7 81)) can be further written as \nNow 18 is cancelled in the fraction = 225 \u00d7  (  ( 3 \u00d7 6 )  /  ( 18 \u00d7 9 ) ) =  ( 3 \u00d7 5 )  / ( 9 )\n=  ( 15 ) / ( 9 )"
