    "To find the number of ways Karl can select four crayons from 12 different-colored crayons, we can use the concept of combinations. \n\nCombinations are used when the order does not matter, and the formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to be selected.\n\nIn this case, n = 12 (total number of crayons) and r = 4 (number of crayons to be selected).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the factorial of n (12):\n\n12! = 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n\nHowever, it's not necessary to calculate the entire factorial. We can only calculate up to (n - r) because the remaining part will be canceled out by r!.\n\nLet's calculate the factorial of (n - r), which is 8 (12 - 4):\n\n8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n\nNow, we can apply the formula for combinations:\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * 8!)\n= (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8!) / (4! * 8!)\n= (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / 4!\n= (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n= 495\n\nSo, the number of ways Karl can select four crayons from 12 different-colored crayons is:\n\n$\\boxed{495}$",
    "To find the number of ways Karl can select four crayons if the order doesn't matter, we can use the combination formula.\n\nThe combination formula is: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of items (in this case, 12 crayons)\n- k is the number of items to select (in this case, 4 crayons)\n- n! denotes the factorial of n (n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * (12-4)!)\n= 12! / (4! * 8!)\n= (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8!) / (4! * 8!)\n= (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4!),\nsince the 8! cancels out.\n\nNow, let's calculate the values:\n12 * 11 * 10 * 9 = 11880\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n\nSo, C(12, 4) = 11880 / 24\n= 495\n\nTherefore, the number of ways Karl can select four crayons is: \n$$\\boxed{495}$$.",
    "This is a combination problem, where the order of selection doesn't matter. \n\nWe need to select 4 crayons out of 12. The formula for combination is given by C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items (12 in this case), r is the number of items to be selected (4 in this case), and '!' denotes factorial.\n\nFirst, let's calculate 12!, 4!, and (12-4)!. \n\n12! = 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 479001600,\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24,\n8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40320\n\nNow, let's put the values into the combination formula. \nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * 8!) = 479001600 / (24 * 40320)\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can start by calculating the denominator. \n(24 * 40320) = 967680\n\nNow, divide the numerator by the result of the denominator. \n479001600 / 967680 = 496\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{496}$ ways for Karl to select four crayons."

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I found the following issues:\n\nSolution 1 and Solution 2 are correct and provide the same answer, which is 495. They correctly applied the combination formula and calculated the result.\n\nSolution 3, however, contains an error.

  "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",
