    "To compute the expression \\[\\frac{(N-1)!(N)}{(N+1)!},\\] let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Recall the definition of factorial: \\(n! = n \\times (n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times \\ldots \\times 2 \\times 1\\).\n\n2. Rewrite the expression using the factorial definition: \\[\\frac{(N-1)!(N)}{(N+1)!} = \\frac{(N-1)!(N)}{(N+1) \\times N \\times (N-1)!}\\]\n\n3. Notice that \\((N-1)!\\) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so we can cancel it out: \\[\\frac{(N-1)!(N)}{(N+1)!} = \\frac{N}{(N+1) \\times N}\\]\n\n4. Cancel out the common factor \\(N\\) from the numerator and the denominator: \\[\\frac{N}{(N+1) \\times N} = \\frac{1}{N + 1}\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{\\frac{1}{N + 1}}.",
    "To simplify the given expression, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The expression is \\[\\frac{(N-1)!(N)}{(N+1)!}.\\]\n\n2.

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I found that all three solutions are correct and reach the same final answer: \\boxed{\\frac{1}{N+1}}.\n\nHowever, if I had to select the best solution, I would choose Solution 1.

Solution 1 avoids unnecessary steps and calculations, making it easier to follow and understand.\n3.

  "solution": "Since $N!=(N-1)!(N)$, we can rewrite the given fraction as $\\frac{N!}{(N+1)!}$. We can rewrite the denominator as $(N+1)!=(N!)(N+1)$, so the fraction becomes $\\frac{N!}{(N!)(N+1)}$. Canceling an $N!$ from the numerator and denominator, we are left with $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{N+1}}$.",
