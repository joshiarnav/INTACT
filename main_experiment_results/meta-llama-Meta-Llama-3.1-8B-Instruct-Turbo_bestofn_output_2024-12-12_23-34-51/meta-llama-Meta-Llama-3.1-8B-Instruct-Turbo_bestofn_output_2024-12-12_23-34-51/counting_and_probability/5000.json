  "problem": "A soccer team has $22$ available players. A fixed set of $11$ players starts the game, while the other $11$ are available as substitutes. During the game, the coach may make as many as $3$ substitutions, where any one of the $11$ players in the game is replaced by one of the substitutes. No player removed from the game may reenter the game, although a substitute entering the game may be replaced later. No two substitutions can happen at the same time. The players involved and the order of the substitutions matter. Let $n$ be the number of ways the coach can make substitutions during the game (including the possibility of making no substitutions). Find the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$.\n",

    "To find the number of ways the coach can make substitutions during the game, we need to consider the following possibilities: \n\n1. Making no substitutions\n2. Making one substitution\n3. Making two substitutions\n4. Making three substitutions\n\n1. Making no substitutions: \nThere is only $1$ way to make no substitutions.\n\n2. Making one substitution: \nThe coach can choose $1$ of the $11$ starting players to be replaced, and then choose $1$ of the $11$ substitutes to take their place. This gives the coach $11 \\times 11 = 121$ ways to make one substitution.\n\n3. Making two substitutions: \nIf the coach makes two substitutions, there are $3$ different scenarios: \n\n(i) The first substitution, and then the second substitution\n(ii) The second substitution, and then the first substitution \n\nIf the coach makes the first substitution, then there are $11$ ways to choose the player being replaced and $11$ ways to choose the substitute. Then, the coach can choose $1$ of the remaining $10$ starting players to be replaced and $1$ of the remaining $10$ substitutes to take their place. This gives $11 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 12100$ ways for the coach to make the first substitution and then the second substitution. \n\nIf the coach makes the second substitution, then there are $11$ ways to choose the player being replaced and $11$ ways to choose the substitute. Then, the coach can choose $1$ of the remaining $10$ starting players to be replaced and $1$ of the remaining $10$ substitutes to take their place. This gives $11 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 12100$ ways for the coach to make the second substitution and then the first substitution. \n\nHowever, we need to multiply these $12100$ scenarios by $2$ because the order matters (i.e., the first substitution and then the second is a different scenario from the second substitution and then the first). In this case, however,  these two option -- (i) and (ii) -- have the same combinations values, due to 11 * 11 * 10 * 10 being equal in both. \nTherefore, the total number of ways to make two substitutions is $12100 \\cdot 2 - 11*11*10*10 = 24200 - 12100 = 12100.$\n\n4. Making three substitutions:\nThe coach needs to make the first, second, and third substitutions, but since no player can reenter the game, when the coach makes the first substitution, there are only $10$ players left to choose from for the second, and then $9$ for the third. \n\nIf the coach chooses to make the first, second, and third substitutions, the coach can choose $1$ of the $11$ starting players to be replaced, and then $1$ of the $11$ substitutes to take their place. Then, the coach can choose $1$ of the remaining $10$ starting players to be replaced and $1$ of the remaining $10$ substitutes to take their place. Finally, the coach can choose $1$ of the remaining $9$ starting players to be replaced and $1$ of the remaining $9$ substitutes to take their place. This gives $11 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 1089000$ ways for the coach to make the first, second, and third substitutions, but we need to multiply this by $3! = 6$ because there are $3!$ ways to order the three substitutions, and thus we need to multiply the total values by six.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to make three substitutions is $6 \\cdot 1089000 = 6534000.$\n\nFinally, the coach can make at most $3$ substitutions, and we add up the possibilities from making no substitutions through making $3$ substitutions. This gives a total of $1 + 121 + 12100 + 6534000 = \\boxed{6547222}$ ways the coach can make substitutions during the game.\n\nTo find the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$, we need to find the remainder when $6547222$ is divided by $1000$, which gives $\\boxed{222}$.",
    "To find the number of ways the coach can make substitutions, we need to consider the number of options for each possible substitution. \n\n1. **No substitutions**: There is $1$ way to make no substitutions.\n\n2. **One substitution**: There are $11$ choices for the player to be removed and $11$ choices for the player to be inserted, so there are $11 \\times 11 = 121$ ways for one substitution.\n\n3. **Two substitutions**: After the first substitution, there are $10$ remaining players who can be removed. For the first substitution, there are $11$ choices for the player to be removed and $11$ choices for the player to be inserted. So, for the first substitution, there are $11 \\times 11 = 121$ ways. After the first substitution, there are $10$ remaining players who can be removed and $10$ remaining players to be inserted. So, for the second substitution, there are $10 \\times 10 = 100$ ways.

    "To find the number of ways the coach can make substitutions during the game, we can break it down into several cases, considering the number of substitutions made.\n\nCase 1: No substitutions are made.\n\nIn this case, there is only 1 possible way to make no substitutions.\n\nCase 2: 1 substitution is made.\n\nThe coach has 11 players to choose from to be removed from the game, and 11 substitutes to choose from to enter the game. Therefore, the number of ways to make 1 substitution is $11 \\times 11 = 121$.\n\nCase 3: 2 substitutions are made.\n\nTo make 2 substitutions, the coach first has 11 choices for the player to be removed, and then 10 choices for the next player to be removed (since one player has already been removed). For the first substitution, there are 11 choices for the substitute to enter. For the second substitution, there are 10 choices for the player to be removed (since one player has already been substituted out), and 10 choices for the next substitute to enter.

  "solution": "There are $0-3$ substitutions. The number of ways to sub any number of times must be multiplied by the previous number. This is defined recursively. The case for $0$ subs is $1$, and the ways to reorganize after $n$ subs is the product of the number of new subs ($12-n$) and the players that can be ejected ($11$). The formula for $n$ subs is then $a_n=11(12-n)a_{n-1}$ with $a_0=1$.\nSumming from $0$ to $3$ gives $1+11^2+11^{3}\\cdot 10+11^{4}\\cdot 10\\cdot 9$. Notice that $10+9\\cdot11\\cdot10=10+990=1000$.
