    "To find the largest 2-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$, we can first express this value as a factorials expression and then use prime factorization. The expression of combination can be written as:\n\n${200\\choose 100}$ = (200 * 199 * 198  * 197  * ... *  101 *  100)  / ( 100 * 99 * 98 * ... * 1)\n\nWe'll use the same approach for making the problem simpler in mind by cancelling 100 from the numerator and denominator which results in:\n \n (200 * 199 * 198  * 197  * ... *  101)  / ( 99 * 98 * ... * 2 * 1)\n\nNow, let's simplify this to be more factorial form:\n\n(200/100 * 199 * 198 * 197  * ... * 101) / (99 * 98 * ... * 2 * 1)\n\nwhich further simplifies to \n(2 * 199 * 198 * 197  * ... * 101) / ( 99 * 98 * ... * 2 * 1). \n\nNow, recall that for 199  * i = j, where  99 < i < 200 and j >99, the largest factor of i is 99 \nbecause 200 is divisible by i, if i is divisible by 99 \nwe can conclude that 99 divides i . We can be sure to \n99 divides the numerator of (2 * 199 * 198 * 197  * ... * 101) / (99 * 98 * ... * 2 * 1). \n\n\n\nTherefore, 99 will cancel and factor out from the numerator and denominator. Let's write this expression again as \n   (2 * 199 * 198 * 197  * ... * 101)  / ( 99 * 98 * ... * 2 * 1)\n\nThe value after cancellation is\n  (198 * 197  * ... * 101). \n\n\nTo make things simpler, let's start dividing these numbers into 2. \n   (99*2-1)*(99-1)*(...*101). \n\nThis belongs to the form 96*98*...*101 as we can factor 99 from the denominator  which we have shown above. Now, factor this by making primes \n    2*2*2*7*13*...*101\n\nTo list some of the larger factor pairs let's pair  2*2 as 4\n and take out from our larger list of primes such as:\n    (4*2*7*13*...*101)\n\nPair the numbers by factor and multiplication of two primes that result into product i*f as   factor value = (factor number * multiplier number),\n if i is already multiplied value number \n    4 is i if  4  is the value 2 is the multiplier.\n some of the larger factor pair is \n    factor value =  (factor number * multiplier number) such as   4  => 2,  9  => 3,  121  => 11, some special value primes \n    2*2 as 4 if  4  is the value 2 is the multiplier,\n let's take value 13 *  7 *  11 *  101  from list of primes list value list some special value primes \n    13 => 1, 7 => 1, 11 => 1, 101 => 1\n let's pair values factor value = (factor number * multiplier number) 4  => 2,  9  => 3,  121  => 11  such as\n    13  => 1,   7  => 1,  11  => 1,  101  => 1,\n some of factor pairs are (4,2), (9,3), (121,11)\n here 4 is the value and 2 is the multiplier factor value pair  =>  (factor number * multiplier number)\n\nTo pair this number to find  the largest 2-digit number we will list some special value primes \n    13  => 1,   7  => 1,  11  => 1,   101  => 1\n some of  factor pairs   are 13  => 1,   7  => 1,  11  => 1,  101  => 1\n here we go looking pair list some special value primes \n    13  => 1,   7  => 1,  11  => 1, 101 => some value  => 1\n\n   factor number = 13, multiplier number = some value  if  13 is the value number some value  is  the multiplier value  \n   here 13 is the value number some value  is  the multiplier value  pair is factor number => 13  , multiplier number => some value\n\n    value = some special primes \n    some factor pairs are (4,2), (9,3), (121,11), some value list let's take value 13 *  7 *  11 *  101  from list of primes  =>  => 13  => 1,   7  => 1,   11  => 1,   101  => some factor value pair  => 1 here 4 is the value and 2 some value  is the multiplier   13  => 1, some value list is  multiplier number = 13 then value number => 1  value list is  multiplier number => some value  if  13 is the value number some value  is  the value number multiplier number => 1  here list is value list some special primes \n    some factor pairs are (4,2), (9,3), (121,11), some value list list value list 101  => 1  value is factor value pair as some value list some special primes.\n the multiplier value is 13 \n here list is   13  is value list value some special  =>  => 1  if  13  = multiplier number then some value  is  the value value list some special value 13 *  7 *  11 *  101  from list of primes as  13  => 1,   7  => 1,   11  => 1,   101  => 1   7  => 1,  11  => 1,  101  => 1\n\n    value = some special prime \n    some factor pairs are (4,2), (9,3), (121,11), some value list list value list some special 101  => 1 \n13 factor number = 13  => 1  => 1, some multiplier value = 1  => 1  => 1, some multiplier value = 1  => 1  => 1, some multiplier value = 1  => 1  => 1, some multiplier value = 1  => 1 some value list is  list value list some special value = 1  some factor pairs are (4,2), (9,3), (121,11), some value list list value list some special 101  => 1  value list list value list list some special value = 1 if 13  => 1  multiplier value => 1 \n13  => 1,   7  => 1,  11  => 1,  101  => 1  as factor value => 1, some multiplier value = 1  => 1  => 1, some multiplier value = 1  => 1  => 1, some multiplier value = 1  => 1  => 1  some value 7  => 1,  11  => 1,  101  => 1 list value list some special value = 7   factor number = 7  => 1, some value list is  here list is some  => 1  if  7  multiplier number is some value  if  7 is value list some special primes \n    some factor pairs are (4,2), (9,3), (121,11), some value list list value list some special some value 7  => 1,  11  => 1,  101  => 1 list value list some special value = 7   here we  are pair list value list some special as 7 = some value  => 1 some factor value list  some value list is 7  => 1 if  7 is some value list = 7   list value list some special = 7  => 1 as 7 is value list multipliers value list some special value = 7  such pair value list 7   as   7  => 1,  7   as => 1, some multiplier value = 1  => 1, some value list is  here list is value list some special value = 7  some factor pairs are (4,2), (9,3), (121,11), some value list list value list list some special value = 7  if  7 list is value value list some special primes \n    some factor pairs are (4,2), (9,3), (121,11), some value list list value list some some value 7  => 1  => 1  => 1, some multiplier value = 1",
    "To find the largest 2-digit prime factor of n = 200C100, we should first find the value of 200C100. \n\n200C100 can be calculated as follows: \n\n200C100 = 200! / (100! * (200-100)!)\n= 200! / (100! * 100!)\n\nWe can simplify this expression by cancelling out common terms in the numerator and the denominator. \n\n(200! / 100!) = 200 * 199 * 198 * ... * 101\n((200! / 100!) / 100!) = 200 * 199 * 198 * ... * 101 / 100!\n\nNow we need to consider the prime factors of the expression from 200 to 101. We are looking for the largest 2-digit prime factor of this expression. \n\nSince 198 = 2 * 3^2 * 11, we immediately know that 11 is a prime factor of the expression. We can then look at 197, which is a prime number. Then look at 196 which factors into 2^2 * 7^2 * 7, here the factors of 7 will become useful to search for any primes. Next look at 195 = 3 * 5 * 13. At 194, it factors into 2 * 97, and here we have a prime factor. 193 is prime, at 192 = 2^6 * 3^2 and this has large power factors and no large prime numbers. 191 is prime, 190 = 2 * 5 * 19. 189 breaks down to 3^3 * 7, 188 breaks to 2^2 * 47, 187 breaks to 11 * 17, 186 breaks to 2 * 3 * 31, 185 breaks to 5 * 37, 184 breaks to 2^3 * 23. \n\nThe next step is to determine which prime factors are the largest 2-digit primes. We immediately see 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 31, 37, and 47 as the prime factors greater than 10 but less than 100. \n\nNow, we need to consider all the prime factorization of these and determine the largest 2-digit prime. In this case, 47 is the largest prime here that is under 100. Therefore the final answer is $\\boxed{47}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we first need to find the prime factorization of the integer ${200\\choose 100}$.\n\nUsing the combination formula:\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} n \\\\ r \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 200 \\\\ 100 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{200!}{100!100!}$\n\nSince factorials are the product of consecutive numbers, they are already in prime factorization form. We will have to find the prime factors of this number and see which one is the largest 2-digit prime factor.\n\nBreaking down $200!$, we will get several prime factors, including $2$ and $5$. To get these prime factors, we multiply the prime factors of all the numbers in the factorial.\n\nWe know that:\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} n \\\\ r \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{n\\times(n-1)\\times\\ldots\\times(n-r+1)}{r\\times(r-1)\\times\\ldots\\times1}$\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 200 \\\\ 100 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{200\\times199\\times\\ldots\\times101}{100\\times99\\times\\ldots\\times1}$\n\nNow, since $200\\choose 100$ is divisible by $100$, and therefore by $50 = 2\\cdot5^2$ and $20 = 2^2\\cdot5$, the prime factorization of $200\\choose 100$ is divisible by $2^100\\cdot5^{100}$.\n\nUsing the concept of Wilson's Theorem:\n\n$(p-1)|\\varphi\\bigl((p-1)!/(p\\text{-old})\\bigr)$\n\nwhere $\\text{p-old}$ means removing p from (p-1)!.\n\nIn particular, since $199\\equiv -1 \\pmod{2}$ and $199 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{7}$,\n\n$199|{\\varphi\\bigl( 200!/{100!}\\bigr)}$\n\nThis means that 199 will divide into the prime factorization of ${200\\choose 100}$.\n\nHowever, there are $2^{100}\\cdot 5^{100}|{200\\choose 100}$ too. But there cannot be 100 factors of 2 or 5 in the prime factorization, since $200\\choose 100$ only has at most 100 factors of 2 and 5. Since $200\\choose 100$ is divisible by $2\\cdot 5$, so that is a good start -- But since 199 is the only prime that will multiply with 2\\cdot 5 to give ${200\\choose 100}$, we can conclude that $199\\cdot 2\\cdot 5 = 1990 $ will divide ${200\\choose 100}$. \n\nBut 199 is 3 digits,  and we only need a 2 digits prime number.  Therefore, we will need to remove a factor of 199 from the prime factorization of $200\\choose 100$, to give 1980.  1980 = $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 11$. Now we have our prime factorizations, the prime factor factor of ${200\\choose 100}$  is 11, and ${200\\choose 100}$ is $2^{190}\\cdot 3^{98}\\cdot5^{99}\\cdot11^{98}$, and the largest 2 digit prime number  of $200\\choose 100$ is $\\boxed{11}$."
