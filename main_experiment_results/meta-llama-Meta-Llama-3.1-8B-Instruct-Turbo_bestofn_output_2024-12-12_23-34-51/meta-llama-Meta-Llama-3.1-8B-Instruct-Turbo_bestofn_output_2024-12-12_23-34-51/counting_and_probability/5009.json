  "problem": "Let $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ be the vertices of a regular tetrahedron each of whose edges measures 1 meter.

Let $p = \\frac n{729}$ be the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ when it has crawled exactly 7 meters. Find the value of $n$.\n",

    "To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach and a Markov chain.\n\nLet $P_n$ denote the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ after crawling $n$ meters. \n\n1.
