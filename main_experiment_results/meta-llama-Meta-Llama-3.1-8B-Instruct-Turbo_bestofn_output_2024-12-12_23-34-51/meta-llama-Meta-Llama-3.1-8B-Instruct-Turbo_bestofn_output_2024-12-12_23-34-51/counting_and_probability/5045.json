    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the range of possible values for the number of students studying both languages.\n\nFirst, we can express the number of students studying Spanish as a percentage of the school population:\n\nNumber of students studying Spanish = 0.8 * 2001 \u2264 S \u2264 0.85 * 2001\n0.8 * 2001 \u2264 S \u2264 1700.85\n1600.8 \u2264 S \u2264 1700.85\n\nRound to the nearest whole number to express S as a whole number since you can't have a fraction of a student,\nThus S ranges from 1601 to 1700.\n\nSimilarly, the number of students studying French as a percentage of the school population is:\nNumber of students studying French = 0.3 * 2001 \u2264 F \u2264 0.4 * 2001\n600.3 \u2264 F \u2264 800.4\n\nRound to the nearest whole number to express F as a whole number since you can't have a fraction of a student,\nThus F ranges from 601 to 800.\n\nLet S \u2229 F represent the set of students studying both Spanish and French, and let |S \u2229 F| be the number of students in this set. Then, we have the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n|S| + |F| - |S \u2229 F| = |S \u222a F|\n\nSince every student studies either Spanish or French, we know that |S \u222a F| = 2001\n\n|S \u222a F| = |S| + |F| - |S \u2229 F|\n\nReplacing |S \u222a F| with 2001,\n\n2001 = S + F - S \u2229 F\n\nNow, we need to express S and F as the smallest and largest possible values to find the range for S \u2229 F.\n\nSmallest number of students studying both languages (m):\nMin (S) = 1601,\nMin (F) = 601,\nS \u2229 F = Min(S) + Min(F) - 2001 = 1601 + 601 - 2001 = 201\nThus, the minimum possible number of students who study both languages, m, is 201.\n\nLargest number of students studying both languages (M):\nMax (S) = 1700,\nMax (F) = 800,\nS \u2229 F = Max(S) + Max(F) - 2001 = 1700 + 800 - 2001 = 499\nThus, the maximum possible number of students who study both languages, M, is 499.\n\nTo find the answer in the required format, you need to subtract the minimum possible value from the maximum possible value for the number of students studying both languages.\n\nTo get M - m\n= 499 - 201\n= 298\n\nTherefore, \nM - m = 298",
    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students studying both languages, given the percentages studying Spanish and French. We'll start by finding the minimum and maximum number of students studying Spanish and French.\n\nLet's consider the students studying Spanish. The percentage range is between $80\\%$ and $85\\%$. We need to find the minimum and maximum number of students studying Spanish, which is $80\\%$ and $85\\%$ of 2001. \n\nThe minimum number of students studying Spanish can be found by multiplying $0.80$ by $2001$: \n$2001 \\times 0.80 = 1600.8$. Since the number of students must be a whole number, we need to round up to the nearest integer to ensure we are considering a whole student population, giving us $1601$ students.\n\nSimilarly, the maximum number of students studying Spanish can be found by multiplying $0.85$ by $2001$: \n$2001 \\times 0.85 = 1700.85$. We round down to the nearest integer since we are looking at the maximum number, giving us $1700$ students.\n\nFollowing the same logic, the minimum number of students studying French can be found by multiplying $0.30$ by $2001$: \n$2001 \\times 0.30 = 600.3$. We round up to the nearest integer, giving us $601$ students.\n\nThe maximum number of students studying French can be found by multiplying $0.40$ by $2001$: \n$2001 \\times 0.40 = 800.4$. We round down to the nearest integer, giving us $800$ students.\n\nNow that we have the minimum and maximum number of students studying both languages, we need to use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to find the smallest and largest number of students studying both languages.\n\nLet's denote $S$ as the set of students studying Spanish, and $F$ as the set of students studying French, and let $S \\cap F$ be the set of students studying both languages.\n\nThe total number of students is:\n\\[|S \\cup F| = |S| + |F| - |S \\cap F|.\\]\n\nNow, let's find the minimum and maximum number of students studying both languages.\n\nWhen looking at the smallest number of students that could study both languages ($m$), the maximum number of students studying Spanish is 1700, the maximum number of students studying French is 601, and the total number of students is 2001. We can write the equation as follows: \n\\[2001 \\le 1700 + 601 - m.\\]\n\nThis gives us the inequality:\n\\[2001 \\le 2301 - m.\\]\n\nBy solving the inequality for $m$, we get:\n\\[m \\ge 300.\\]\n\nWhen looking at the largest number of students that could study both languages ($M$), the minimum number of students studying Spanish is 1601, the minimum number of students studying French is 800, and the total number of students is 2001.

    "To find the smallest and largest number of students who could study both languages, we need to determine the range of possible numbers of students studying Spanish and French.\n\nThe total number of students is $2001$.\n\n1. Let $S$ be the number of students studying Spanish, and $F$ be the number of students studying French. \n\nSince the number of students who study Spanish is between $80\\%$ and $85\\%$ of the school population, $S$ must be between $\\left \\lfloor{80\\% \\times 2001}\\right \\rfloor = 1600$ and $\\left \\lfloor{85\\% \\times 2001}\\right \\rfloor = 1700$. So, the number of students studying Spanish is at least $1601$ and at most $1700$.\n\nSimilarly, the number of students who study French is between $30\\%$ and $40\\%$ of the school population, $F$ must be between $\\left \\lfloor{30\\% \\times 2001}\\right \\rfloor = 600$ and $\\left \\lfloor{40\\% \\times 2001}\\right \\rfloor = 800$. So, the number of students studying French is at least $601$ and at most $800$.\n\n2. The number of students studying both Spanish and French is given by $S + F - 2001$, as we know the total number of students and the total number of students studying either Spanish or French (or both).\n\nTo minimize the number of students studying both languages, $S$ must be as small as possible and $F$ must be as small as possible. \n\nTo maximize the number of students studying both languages, $S$ must be as large as possible and $F$ must be as large as possible.\n\n3. The smallest number of students who could study both languages is:\n\n$$m = (S_{min} + F_{min}) - 2001$$\n\nSubstituting the minimum values from step 1:\n\n$$m = (1601 + 601) - 2001$$\n\n$$m = 1202 - 2001$$\n\n$$m =  -799$$\n\nSince you can't have negative students, we need to find the next lowest number that satisfies the conditions. We need to increase the minimum value of F by 1 while decreasing S by 1:\n\n$$m = (1600 + 600) - 2001$$\n\n$$m = 1200 - 2001$$\n\n$$m = -801$$\n\nSince we still have negative students, we continue adjusting our numbers. Let's change S and F again to make sure S and F are positive:\n\n$$m = (1600 + 601) - 2001$$\n\n$$m = 1201 - 2001$$\n\n$$m = -800$$\n\nWe're getting close, so let's change the numbers one more time:\n\n$$m = (1600 + 600) - 2001$$\n\n$$m = 1200 - 2001$$\n\n$$m = -801$$\n\nSince we are getting very close to the answer, I'll adjust the numbers with the correct S & F in a different order:\n\n$$m = (1600 + 601 - 1) - 2001$$\n\n$$m = 1200 - 2001$$\n\n$$m = -801 + 1$$\n\n$$m = (1600 + 601 - 2001) + 1$$\n\n$$m = (1200 - 1) + 1$$\n\n$$m = 1201 - 1$$\n\n$$m = 1200$$\n\nThis works because $s$ and $F$ are positive integers.\n\n4. The largest number of students who could study both languages is:\n\n$$M = (S_{max} + F_{max}) - 2001$$\n\nSubstituting the maximum values from step 1:\n\n$$M = (1700 + 800) - 2001$$\n\n$$M = 2500 - 2001$$\n\n$$M = 499$$\n\n5. The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students who could study both languages is:\n\n$$M - m = 499 - 1200$$\n\n$$M - m = -701$$\n\nSince we know we can't have negative students, the final answer is the correct difference between M & m without the negative value:\n\n$$M - m = 701$$\n\nEnsure your answer is in the format $\\boxed{answer}$\n\n$\\boxed{701}$"
