  "problem": "The cards in a stack of $2n$ cards are numbered consecutively from 1 through $2n$ from top to bottom. The top $n$ cards are removed, kept in order, and form pile $A.$ The remaining cards form pile $B.$ The cards are then restacked by taking cards alternately from the tops of pile $B$ and $A,$ respectively. In this process, card number $(n+1)$ becomes the bottom card of the new stack, card number 1 is on top of this card, and so on, until piles $A$ and $B$ are exhausted. If, after the restacking process, at least one card from each pile occupies the same position that it occupied in the original stack, the stack is named magical. For example, eight cards form a magical stack because cards number 3 and number 6 retain their original positions. Find the number of cards in the magical stack in which card number 131 retains its original position.\n",

    "To find the number of cards in the magical stack where card number 131 retains its original position, we need to understand how the restacking process affects the position of the cards.\n\nLet's assume that there are $2n$ cards in total. When we remove the top $n$ cards to form pile A, the remaining cards form pile B. \n\nSince card number 131 needs to retain its original position, it must be in pile B, and it must be an odd-positioned card in pile B. \n\nWhen cards are restacked by taking cards alternately from the tops of pile B and A, the position of each card is shifted by either 1 or 2 spots, depending on its original position. However, after an odd number of cards from each pile are exhausted, a card from pile A will occupy the position of a card from the original pile A, and a card from the original pile A will occupy the position that it originally did.\n\nSince 131 is in pile B, it has to be in pile B when the restacking is done. Therefore, the 131st card must end up as the (2k + 131)th card from the bottom of the stack.\n\nNow, to see when this happens, we need to look at the cards from pile A. Each card is taken from pile A is one place after alternating from the end of the stack. Similarly, to reach the 131st card, we need to see how many cards from each pile we need to take before reaching this position.\n\nSince there are $n$ cards in pile A (and thus also $n$ cards in pile B), to reach the 131st card as the (2k+131)th card, we must have gone through (131 - 1)/2 = 65 cards from pile B and 64 cards from pile A before reaching the 131st card. Thus we have n \u2265 64 + 65 = 129.\n\nNow, we just need to find a value of $n$ which has 129 as the least multiple to satisfy the assumption of there being $2n$ cards in the beginning of the game which also makes 131 retain its position on the magical stack. \n\nTherefore, if we let $n=129$ and $2n=258,$ these conditions are satisfied, so the number of cards in the magical stack is 2 * 129. \n\nHowever, note that while n \u2265 129, it is a multi-value for 2n. Try checking that the cards with value 131 is on the pile b 131 = 129 + 2.",
    "To find the number of cards in the magical stack in which card number 131 retains its original position, we first need to understand the restacking process.\n\nWhen we take cards alternately from the tops of pile B and pile A, we can pair them as follows: \n\n- The top card of pile B (number n+1) pairs with the bottom card of pile A (number 1) to become the bottom card of the new stack.\n- The top card of pile A (number 2) pairs with the second card from the top of pile B (number n+2) to become the second card from the bottom of the new stack.\n- The top card of pile B (number n+2) pairs with the second card from the top of pile A (number 3) to become the second card from the top of the new stack.\n- This pattern continues until all cards are restacked.\n\nFor card number 131 to retain its original position, it must be a card from pile A after the top n cards are removed, and it must be in an odd position in the restacked stack (since cards from pile B are always in even positions in the restacked stack).\n\nThe position of card 131 in the original stack is (2n-129). However, in the restacked stack, odd positions are occupied by cards from pile A and their original numbers are preserved. Since we're dealing with cards in pile A and 131 is in an odd position, let a be the position in the restacked pile A that card 131 occupies.  Since card 131 is in odd position in pile A,  2n - 131 must be odd. 131 in  pile A was in 131 - 1 in set A since  we begin counting  set A at card 1. Since card 131 now in pile  A  was card number 131 - 1 at pile A  130 in set A, we can look at the original set from (n+1) to n where one card from this set was  2n - 131 in the set A after a 127 iterations were completed where  card 131 was at pile A\u2019s odd position at number 130.\n\nIn order  2n - 131  to  be  odd  we must  ensure that the total  2n iterations in the original  set  conclude  at  a  129 odd number from pile A.\n\nIn order to  have card  131  end  up  in  an odd  position  at  130, we  know that the  sequence  was  127+1 (1+127),  2n-130  is  in  position  130 after a  127  interation set finishing a remainder odd set  ending at 130 at position 'a'. This is the card that remains  at 131\u2019s original number.  However in a remainder  1 odd card positioning  2n - 129 at  130 at A pile, ending two sequence remainder in  sequence.",
    "To solve this problem, let's consider how the restacking process works. \n\nWhen cards are drawn from piles A and B alternately to form the new stack, we can think of it as adding 1 to the new position for every card drawn from B and adding 2 to the new position for every card drawn from A. \n\nLet's assume there are n cards in pile A and n cards in pile B. The new stack will have 2n cards. Since we are drawing cards alternately, the cards drawn from B will occupy positions 1, 3, 5, ..., 2n-1 and the cards drawn from A will occupy positions 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n.\n\nNow, let's consider how a card from the original stack can retain its original position. If a card from pile A retains its original position, it must be one of the n cards in A. Since the cards drawn from A occupy positions that are even indices (2, 4, 6, ... 2n), A must be in an even index for it to retain its original position. But, since A is in pile A, which consists of the top n cards (1 through n), it cannot occupy an even index of the new stack. Therefore, only cards from pile B can retain their position.\n\nA card from pile B can retain its original position if it occupies an odd index (1, 3, 5, ... 2n-1) in the new stack. However, since the original cards are numbered from 1 through 2n, the card 131 is in pile A. The fact that the question asks for the number of cards in the stack where 131 retains its position indicates that 131 must be in pile A. \n\nSince A must be in an even index of the original stack to be in pile A and 131 is at an even index in the original stack, this isn't the case. The 131 is an odd index in the pile A original cards. Thus our reasoning was wrong so our new standpoint is card 131 must be in pile B. Because that is our real hypothesis now.\nWe know that 131 retains its original position, and since 131 is now in pile B (at an odd index), it must occupy an odd index in the new stack as well. Given the formula that the new position of a card is the position of the card in the original stack plus the number of cards drawn from pile B minus 131:\n\nLet's think of the numbers of pile B as x. Hence the number of cards in a stack will be n = x. The original position of the card 131 in the stack is x+131. The new position of the card 131 is as follows: \n\n131 = (x+ 131 ) + (x-131)  - 131\n\n   =  x+ 131 + x - 131 - 131 \n   = x + x - 131\n\n Thus x = 131*2\n   = 262\n\n Now 262 = n \n   = x"

  "solution": "Since a card from B is placed on the bottom of the new stack, notice that cards from pile B will be marked as an even number in the new pile, while cards from pile A will be marked as odd in the new pile. Since 131 is odd and retains its original position in the stack, it must be in pile A. Also to retain its original position, exactly $131 - 1 = 130$ numbers must be in front of it. There are $\\frac{130}{2} = 65$ cards from each of piles A, B in front of card 131. This suggests that $n = 131 + 65 = 196$; the total number of cards is $196 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{392}$.",
