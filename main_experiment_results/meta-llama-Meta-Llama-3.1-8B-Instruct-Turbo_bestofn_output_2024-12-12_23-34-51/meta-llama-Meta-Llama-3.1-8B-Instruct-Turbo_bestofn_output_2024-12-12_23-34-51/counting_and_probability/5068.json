  "problem": "Seven teams play a soccer tournament in which each team plays every other team exactly once. No ties occur, each team has a $50\\%$ chance of winning each game it plays, and the outcomes of the games are independent. In each game, the winner is awarded a point and the loser gets 0 points. The total points are accumilated to decide the ranks of the teams. In the first game of the tournament, team $A$ beats team $B.$ The probability that team $A$ finishes with more points than team $B$ is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

    "The number of possibilities for the results of the five games played between three teams (for example, team A,B and C with no relation to the previous problem) is 2^5=32.\nWe will focus on the results of the five games played between teams A and B and any of the other teams (not B) and team C since the standalone games between team A and the remaining teams are irrelevant to the problem. The results of the games are independent of each other.\n\n1. When all the games between A and C are won by A, A has 6 points and B has at most 5 (if B wins all their games). Following that, we must arrange B's wins and losses in order to ensure they win at most 5. Following that, we can choose for 2 of the wins for B to be against A, and the other 3 wins could have been against C. The two teams A and B have 6 and 5 wins respectively, and B has at least 1 loss, and the number of possibilities of ordering the remaining wins and losses is B(6, 2 -1) = B(5, 2) = 10. In that case the probability of this outcome is 10/32.\n2. When A wins 4 of the 5 games against C, A has 5 points and B has at most 5. Counting the same approach as above we get 10/32.\n3. When A wins 3 of the 5 games against C, A has 4 points and B has at most 5, and we get 10/32.\n\nTherefore, the total probability of A having more wins than B, and B not winning all games, and the standalone games between A and C being won is 10 + 10 + 10 = 30/32.\n\nBut we have to consider the possibilities of standalone games between A and C. If we consider the case when A wins 4 out of the 5 games against C, then A will have 4 + 1 = 5 points, which is still more than B. If A wins 5 games against the remaining 5 teams, then A will have 6 points and B will have at most 5. This can be considered as A winning all games against the remaining standalone games.\n\nWhen A wins 4 out of the 5 games against C, there are 5 possible outcomes of A's standalone games against the other teams. Thus the number of possible outcomes of A having 5 points, and A's standalone games are (5 * 10)/32. Following that, we can similarly consider when A wins 3 of the 5 games against standalone games.\n\nWhen A wins 3 of the 5 games against C, there are two possible outcomes. Following that, we can choose for A to win one or none of the 5 standalone games. If A wins 4 of the 5 standalone games, then A will have 7 points. If A wins 3 of the 5 standalone games, then A will have 6 points and B will have at most 5 points and standalone wins. In the case that A wins 3 of the 5 standalone games, B will have at most 4 points standalone wins, and we get (B(4, 2 -1) = B(3, 2) = 3) + (B(5, 2 -1) = B(4, 2) =6)  = 9/32.\n\n Following a similar consideration, we can get for the case that A wins 2 of the 5 standalone games standalone wins, we get (B(4, 2 -1) = B(3, 2) = 3) + (B(5, 2 -1) = B(4, 2) =6)  = 9/32.\n\n Following a similar consideration, we can get for the case that A wins 1 of the 5 standalone games standalone wins, we get (B(4, 2 -1) = B(3, 2) = 3) + (B(5, 2 -1) = B(4, 2) =6)  = 9/32.\n\n Following a similar consideration, we can get for the case that A wins 0 of the 5 standalone games, we get ( B(3,2) = 3)/32.\n\nIn that case the total probability for (A having more wins than B) is 30/32 + (5*10)/32 + (2*9)/32 + (3*9)/32 + (3*9)/32 + (3*9)/32 + 3/32.\n\nTherefore the total probability of ( A having more wins than B) is  (30 + 50 + 18 + 27 + 27 + 27 + 3) / 32 = 180/32 = 45/8.\n\nThus the answer is 45 + 8 = 53\n\nThe final answer is 53.",
    "To determine the probability that team A finishes with more points than team B, we first need to determine the number of games played by each team.\n\nEach team will play every other team exactly once, and there are 7 teams, so the total number of games played is: $\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \\frac{(7*6*5!)}{(2*1*5!)} = 21$\n\nSince each team will play 6 games, we need to determine the possible outcomes of these 6 games for each team.\n\nTo calculate the probability that team A finishes with more points than team B, we need to consider the following possibilities:\n\n- Scenario 1: A wins exactly k games, where 1 \u2264 k \u2264 5. In this case, A will have k wins and B will have at least k+1 wins.\n- Scenario 2: A wins exactly k games, where k \u2265 6. In this case, A will have more wins than B.\n\nThe probability of A winning exactly k games is given by the binomial distribution: $\\binom{6}{k} (1/2)^{6}\\binom{6}{6-k}(1/2)^{6}$, where the factor of $\\binom{6}{6-k}$ arises because the team needs to win k games and have 6-k losses. However, if k is 0-5, B will have k+1 wins and k games which A didn't win. So we consider B wins exactly k+1 games.\n\nThe total probability that team A has more points than team B is then: $\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\left( \\binom{6}{k} (1/2)^{6}\\binom{6}{k+1}(1/2)^{6} \\right) + \\sum_{k=6}^{k=6} \\left( \\binom{6}{k} (1/2)^{6}\\binom{0}{6-k}(1/2)^{0} \\right)$. This simplifies to $91/512$.",
    "To determine the probability that team $A$ finishes with more points than team $B$, consider the possible outcomes of the games in which either team is involved.\n\nSince team $A$ has already beaten team $B$, the ranking of teams $A$ and $B$ depends on the outcomes of the games between each of them and the other teams. The number of games each team plays is 6 (i.e., five other teams and the fixed game between teams $A$ and $B$). Since there are only seven teams in the tournament and no ties, each team has 6 games overall in the tournament.\n\nThere are three cases to consider:\n\n1. **Both $A$ and $B$ win the same number of games.** \nThis means they both get the same number of points (assuming the points from the first game do not count as part of this as it does not have an impact on the tiebreak). However, given that the $50\\%$ tie occurred (if it wasn't a tie), the outcomes were not all equal, so the number of points for these two teams in this case is not equal. We will need to determine the number of combinations for each side to have the same number of points as the one side to have more points as well as the one side to have less points in the rest of the side's games. We also assume both side win the same number of the games as well. As with side $A$ having 3 games as well as side $B$ having 3 as well as side $A$ winning one tiebreak, we have 4 side $A$ as well as side $B$ side as well in the rest of the games.
