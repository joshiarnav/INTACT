    "To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps.\n\nFirst, we can place $1$ blue flag on each flagpole, because each flagpole must have at least one flag.  This leaves us with $9$ blue flags, $8$ green flags, and with $10$ spots on one pole and $9$ spots on the other pole.\n\nNow, consider first arranging all the green flags, and then inserting the blue flags.  The possible positions of green flags on each pole are ${8\\choose5} = 56$ and  ${8\\choose4} = 70$.\n\nThe spots on the blue pole have 11 spots with one blue flag already placed, and 10 spots on the green pole.  For each of the above two cases (of green flag placements), consider the number of ways to insert the $9$ remaining blue flags, but this will take into account the $1$ blue flag that is already placed on the pole.\n\nWhen the green flags take up $5$ of the spots on the pole with 11 spots, then the remaining blue flags must go in 6 of 7 spots (leaving one spot for the other flag that is already placed).  This can be done in ${6 + 9 \\choose 9} = 4625$ ways.\n\nThe same is true for the case where the green flags take up 4 of the spots on the pole with 10 spots because we will also have 6 of 7 spots on this pole for the remaining blue flags to go in as well.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways of arranging all the flags is $56\\cdot4625 + 70 \\cdot 4625 = 28400000$.\n\nThe remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{00}$",
    "To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps.\n\n**Step 1**:  Using all $19$ flags, let's consider each pole as a separate unit. Since we have $10$ identical blue flags and $9$ identical green flags, we have a total of $10 + 9 = 19$ flags.\n\nLet's consider the possible arrangements of these flags.\n\n**Step 2**:  First, let's arrange the green flags on the pole. There are a total of $9$ green flags. However, no two green flags can be adjacent. To achieve this, we'll use a \"splitter\" system.\n\nImagine a pole divided into compartments by the possible positions of the blue flags. The blue flags will act as \"splitters\" to separate the green flags into distinct groups.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- First, let's assume there are $k$ blue flags separating the green flags.\n- There are $10$ blue flags on the pole, so the number of \"splitters\" is at most $9$. This leaves room for $9 - (k - 1)$ green flags on each side of the blue flags.\n\nNow let's apply this knowledge.\n\n**Step 3**:  There are $10$ blue flags, and these will act as \"splitters\" to separate the green flags. Let's consider the blue flags as \"dividers\" for the green flags.\n\nThere are $\\binom{10}{k}$ ways to choose $k$ blue flags as \"splitters.\" These values are the number of ways to choose positions for the green flags.\n\nHowever, we also need to keep in mind the green flags themselves.\n\n- There are $\\binom{9}{k}$ ways to arrange the green flags, using $k-1$ green flags on one side and the remaining $9-(k-1)$ green flags on the other side.\n\nNow, we need to join the two poles along with their green flags, ensuring no two green flags are adjacent on either pole.\n\n**Step 4**:  Now let's add the restriction that the poles should be distinguishable. There are $\\binom{11}{k}$ ways to select positions for the first pole, and the remaining positions are reserved for the second pole. To calculate the number of arrangements of the green flags on each pole, we multiply the possibilities of each pole and add the case where the $k$ blue flags are placed on the second pole.\n\nTo get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the total possibilities by $2$ to account for the symmetry between the poles.\n\nTo find the value of $N$, we must also multiply the total by $\\sum_{k = 1}^{9} \\binom{10}{k} \\binom{9}{k} \\binom{11}{k}$.",
    "To find the number of distinguishable arrangements, we can first consider the case where there are no restrictions on the placement of the flags. \n\nLet's consider the total number of arrangements for each flagpole, that is 20 flags (10 blue and 10 green, but we do have 9 green here, and that will be crucial).  The total number of arrangements is given by the combination of the 10 blue and 9 green flags, which is $\\binom{20}{10} = 184756$.  \n\nWe then need to consider the number of arrangements that have the green flags next to each other. We will consider one case where green flags are grouped together as a single object. \n\nLet $G_n$ denote the number of flag arrangements where there are $n$ green flags placed. We can start by finding $G_{10}$: After placing the first green flag, we are left with $10$ options for the second green flag. However, we also need to remember the first green flag before that as well. \n\nHowever, we will use another strategy. Let's consider the total number of arrangements for the specific case of this $G_{10}$. There are $\\binom{11}{1} = 11$ arrangements that have all the green flags together (and do not place a blue flag between them). After arranging this specific $G_{11}$ case, we will also remove 11 cases for each specific $G_{1}$ case. (Specifically, we have $11$ such options).  \n\nAlso, we need to remember to consider another important case for each of these $G_n$: As $G_{11}$ has $n=10$ green flags, $G_{1}$ has $n=1$ green flag placed, $G_{2}$ has $n=2$ green flags placed, $G_{3}$ has $n=3$ green flags placed & $G_{4}$ has $n=4$ & $G_{5}$ has $n=5$ & $G_{6}$ has $n=6$ & $G_{7}$ has $n=7$ & $G_{8}$ has $n=8$. We will have to remove cases from each of these options to also consider.\n\nWe can now go ahead and find that number of such arrangements which have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, & 8 of green flags. We have 11 of each of this case. However, for $G_2$ & $G_5$ & $G_6$ & $G_7$ $ & $G_8 $ we will have options of arrangement  $\\binom{10}{1}$, $\\binom{9}{2}$ &  $\\binom{9}{1}$ & $\\binom{8}{2}$ & $\\binom{8}{1}$ since these options will get more & more reduced each time.\n\nHowever, we also need to remember to have $G_{9}$ which has all of the 9 green flags. \n\nSince each $G_i$ has 11 arrangements which also get removed for each case we need to consider both options as a part of this solution. \n\nTherefore, since we have 11 arrangements which also get deleted for each $G_{i }$ options we have: $N = \\binom{20}{10} - 11(G_{11} - G_{1} - \\binom{10}{1} - \\binom{9}{2} - \\binom{9}{1} - \\binom{8}{2} - \\binom{8}{1}+ \\binom{7}{2}+ \\binom{7}{1}+ \\binom{7}{2}+ 1)$. We have both options as a part of the solution.\n\nSince we need to remove 1 case $G_{9 }$ for options of each case.\n\nAfter plugging in this solution we have N = $\\boxed{ 682}$"

  "solution": "The well known problem of ordering $x$ elements of a string of $y$ elements such that none of the $x$ elements are next to each other has ${y-x+1\\choose x}$ solutions. (1)\nWe generalize for $a$ blues and $b$ greens. Consider a string of $a+b$ elements such that we want to choose the greens such that none of them are next to each other. We would also like to choose a place where we can divide this string into two strings such that the left one represents the first pole, and the right one represents the second pole, in order up the pole according to position on the string.\nHowever, this method does not account for the fact that the first pole could end with a green, and the second pole could start with a green, since the original string assumed that no greens could be consecutive. We solve this problem by introducing an extra blue, such that we choose our divider by choosing one of these $a+1$ blues, and not including that one as a flag on either pole.\nFrom (1), we now have ${a+2\\choose b}$ ways to order the string such that no greens are next to each other, and $a+1$ ways to choose the extra blue that will divide the string into the two poles: or $(a+1){a+2\\choose b}$ orderings in total.\nHowever, we have overcounted the solutions where either pole has no flags, we have to count these separately. This is the same as choosing our extra blue as one of the two ends, and ordering the other $a$ blues and $b$ greens such that no greens are next to each other: for a total of $2{a+1\\choose b}$ such orderings.\nThus, we have $(a+1){a+2\\choose b}-2{a+1\\choose b}$ orderings that satisfy the conditions in the problem: plugging in $a=10$ and $b=9$, we get $2310 \\equiv \\boxed{310} \\pmod{1000}$.",
