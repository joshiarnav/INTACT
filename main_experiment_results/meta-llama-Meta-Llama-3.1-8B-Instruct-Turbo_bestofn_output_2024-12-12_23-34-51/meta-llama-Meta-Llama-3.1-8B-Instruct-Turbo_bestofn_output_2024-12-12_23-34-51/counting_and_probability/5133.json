    "To solve this problem, we will first calculate the total number of 10-digit positive integers with digits 1 or 2, and then subtract the number of those without any consecutive 1's.\n\n1. **Total number of 10-digit positive integers with digits 1 or 2:**\n   Since each digit can be either 1 or 2, there are 2 possibilities for each of the 10 digits. Therefore, the total number of 10-digit positive integers with digits 1 or 2 is $2^{10} = 1024$.\n\n2. **Number of 10-digit positive integers with digits 1 or 2 and no consecutive 1's:**\n   Let $a_n$ be the number of $n$-digit positive integers with digits 1 or 2 and no consecutive 1's.\n   To calculate $a_n$, we observe that an $(n+1)$-digit number with digits 1 or 2 and no consecutive 1's must end in a 2. The first $n$ digits can be any valid $n$-digit number and can be followed by the digit 2. Therefore, $a_{n+1} = a_n + a_{n-1}$.\n\n   We also know the base cases $a_1 = 2$ and $a_2 = 3$ since $a_1$ is any single digit from 1 or 2, and for $a_2$ the possibilities are 11, 12, 21, and 22.\n\n   By knowing the recurrence relation $a_{n+1} = a_n + a_{n-1}$, and given base cases $a_1 = 2$ and $a_2 = 3$, we can easily calculate $a_{10}$.\n\n   We use the recurrence relation to find:\n   - $a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 5$\n   - $a_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 8$\n   - $a_5 = a_4 + a_3 = 13$\n   - $a_6 = a_5 + a_4 = 21$\n   - $a_7 = a_6 + a_5 = 34$\n   - $a_8 = a_7 + a_6 = 55$\n   - $a_9 = a_8 + a_7 = 89$\n   - $a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 = 144$\n\n   Therefore, the number of 10-digit positive integers with digits 1 or 2 and no consecutive 1's is $a_{10} = 144$.\n\n3. **Subtract to find the number of 10-digit positive integers with two consecutive 1's:**\n   The total number of 10-digit positive integers with digits 1 or 2 is 1024. The number of 10-digit positive integers with digits 1 or 2 and no consecutive 1's is 144. Therefore, the number of 10-digit positive integers with two consecutive 1's is $1024 - 144 = \\boxed{880}$.",

    "To find the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2 and have two consecutive 1's, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2. Since each digit has 2 options (1 or 2), the total number of possibilities is 2^10 = 1024.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2 and have no consecutive 1's.\n\nConsider the first digit of the integer. We have two options: 1 or 2. \n\nLet's analyze the case when the first digit is 1.\n\n- The second digit must be 2.\n- The third digit can be either 1 or 2.\n\nNow consider the general case. Assume that we have constructed a string of n digits with no consecutive 1's, ending with 2. To extend the string, we can append either 1 or 2. However, if we append 1, it must be preceded by 2 or we must add a new string of a single digit of 1 and a string of n digits with no consecutive 1's.\n\nWhen we append 1 and it is preceded by a 2, the new string is of n+1 digits with no consecutive 1's.\n\nWhen we append 1, but there is no 2 to precede it (the string ended with 1 and an n-digit string with no consecutive 1's), then the new string is of n+2 digits with no consecutive 1's. This new string ends with 1 and has n digits with no consecutive 1's.\n\nWhen we append 2, the new string of n+1 digits will have no consecutive 1's.\n\nUsing the rules we've described, the possible strings have lengths 2n+1 and 2n+2.\n\nSince the strings must end in 2 and have no consecutive 1's, the strings that satisfy these conditions can end in a single digit of 2 or two digits ending in 1 and a 2. The total possible lengths for such strings with no consecutive 1's are therefore the multiplication of the number of possible string lengths and the corresponding existence probabilities.\n\nLet A(n) be the number of n-digit strings with no consecutive 1's.\n\nUsing our rules we've established to create strings of n+1 or n+2 digits, we have:\n\nA(n) = A(n-1) + A(n-2) which is of similar form to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nSince A(1) = 2, A(2) = 3,  A(3) = 5, A(4) = 8, we see that A(n) = F(n+2) where F(n) is the nth Fibonacci number.\n\nThe 11th Fibonacci number is the 12th Fibonacci number minus the 11th Fibonacci number. This equals 144-89, which is 55.\n\nThe 10th Fibonacci number is 55. Adding 55 to the 10th and 9th Fibonacci numbers would give us our amount of our set {55, 34, 55}, which is 55 + 55. \n\nHowever, this doesn't apply to a 10-digit positive integer. In this case, we have 10 digits to consider. When this case doesn't apply to n, there are 2 cases. When the last digit is a 1 and the second last digit is a 2. In this case, the remaining 8 digits are unrestricted and there are 2^8 possibilities. This gives us a total of 2^8 = 256. \n\nWhen the last digit is a 1 and the second last digit is a 1. However, this case has already been counted when the integer is of n digits and n = 10 and has been added to the total of strings of 8 digits. Therefore, the total amount of strings that have 8 digits and n \u2264 8 and the last digit and second digit is either 2 or starts with 2 is  2^8 = 256."

  "solution": "We take as our universe the set of 10-digit integers whose digits are all either 1 or 2, of which there are $2^{10}$, and we count the complement. The complement is the set of 10-digit positive integers composed of the digits 1 and 2 with no two consecutive 1s. Counting such numbers is a popular combinatorial problem: we approach it via a recursion.\nThere are two \"good\" one-digit numbers (1 and 2) and three good two-digit numbers (12, 21 and 22). Each such $n$-digit number is formed either by gluing \"2\" on to the end of a good $(n - 1)$-digit number or by gluing \"21\" onto the end of a good $(n - 2)$-digit number. This is a bijection between the good $n$-digit numbers and the union of the good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. Thus, the number of good $n$-digit numbers is the sum of the number of good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. The resulting recursion is exactly that of the Fibonacci numbers with initial values $F_1 = 2$ and $F_2 = 3$.\nThus, our final answer is $2^{10} - F_{10} = 1024 - 144 = \\boxed{880}$.",
