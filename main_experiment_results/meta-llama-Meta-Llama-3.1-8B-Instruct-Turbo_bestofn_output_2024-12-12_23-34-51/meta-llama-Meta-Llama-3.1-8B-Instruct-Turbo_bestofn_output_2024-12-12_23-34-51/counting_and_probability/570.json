    "To find the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's, we can count the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of outcomes.\n\n1. **Total number of outcomes**: \nWhen Greg rolls four dice, the total number of outcomes is 6^4, which equals 1296.\n\n2. **Favorable outcomes**:\nWe need to count the number of ways to roll more 1's than 6's. Let's break it down into three cases:\n   a) Rolling at least two 1's\n   b) Rolling exactly one 1\n\n3. **Case a)**: Rolling at least two 1's\nIf Greg rolls at least two 1's, the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's is 1, since there are no 6's. \nThe number of ways to roll at least two 1's is given by the combination of 4 dice taken 2 at a time (choosing 2 dice to be 1's) multiplied by the number of ways to roll the other two dice such that there are no 6's on them (5 choices for each die):\n   - C(4,2) * 5^2\n   - C(4,2) = 6 (there are 6 ways to choose two dice to be 1's out of 4)\n\n   So, the number of favorable outcomes in this case is 6 * 25 = 150.\n\n4. **Case b)**: Rolling exactly one 1\nIf Greg rolls exactly one 1, we need to choose which die will be the 1 (C(4,1) = 4) and then choose the values for the other three dice such that there are more 1's than 6's. \nThis can be done in the following ways:\n   - Die 1 is the 1, and the three other dice are not 6's (but at least one of them is a 1), so the other three dice can be (2,2,3), (2,2,4), (2,2,5), (2,2,6), (2,3,3), (2,3,4), (2,3,5), (2,3,6), (2,4,4), (2,4,5), (2,4,6), (2,5,5), (2,5,6), or (3,3,4), (3,3,5), (3,3,6), (3,4,4), (3,4,5), or (4,4,5). \n   - 1 * 6 * 4 * 8 is the total number of outcomes for the third case.\n\n   So, the number of favorable outcomes in this case is 4 * 6 * 8 = 192.\n\n5. **Favorable outcomes for the two cases combined**:\nCombining the results from the above two cases, the total number of favorable outcomes is 150 + 192 = 342.\n\n6. **Final probability**:\nThe probability of rolling more 1's than 6's is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes\nProbability = 342 / 1296\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\nProbability = 57/216\n\nThe answer, in the requested format, is: \n$\\boxed{\\frac{57}{216}}$",
    "To solve this problem, we'll first need to count the total number of possible outcomes when rolling four 6-sided dice. Each die has 6 possible outcomes, so the total number of possible outcomes for four dice is $6^4 = 1296$.\n\nNext, we want to find the number of outcomes where Greg rolls more 1's than 6's. To do this, we can count the number of outcomes where he rolls more 6's than 1's, and then use symmetry to find the number of outcomes where he rolls more 1's than 6's.\n\nThe number of outcomes where Greg rolls more 6's than 1's can be broken down into three cases:\n\n1. Greg rolls two 6's and no 1's, or one 1 and two 6's.\n2. Greg rolls three 6's and one 1.\n3. Greg rolls four 6's.\n\nFor case 1, the number of outcomes is: $\\binom{4}{2} \\cdot 2^4 = 6 \\cdot 16 = 96$.\n\nFor case 2, the number of outcomes is: $\\binom{4}{3} \\cdot 3^4 = 4 \\cdot 81 = 324$.\n\nFor case 3, the number of outcomes is: $\\binom{4}{4} \\cdot 1 = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\nUsing the principle of symmetry, we can say that the number of outcomes where Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is the same as the number of outcomes where he rolls more 6's than 1's.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of outcomes that are either more 1's than 6's or more 6's than 1's. This is equal to the sum of the outcomes in the three cases, plus the outcome where Greg rolls an equal number of 1's and 6's.\n\nThe number of outcomes where Greg rolls an equal number of 1's and 6's can be found in the following ways:\n\n- Greg can roll zero 1's and zero 6's: This is just one outcome, since the other two dice can be any of 4 numbers.\n- Greg can roll one 1 and one 6: This is $\\binom{4}{1} \\cdot \\binom{3}{1} = 4 \\cdot 3 = 12$ outcomes.\n- Greg can roll two 1's and two 6's: This is $\\binom{4}{2} \\cdot \\binom{2}{2} = 6 \\cdot 1 = 6$ outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of outcomes where Greg rolls an equal number of 1's and 6's is: $1 + 12 + 6 = 19$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of outcomes that are either more 1's than 6's or more 6's than 1's is: $96 + 324 + 1 + 19 = 440$.\n\nFinally, the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is the number of outcomes that satisfy this condition, divided by the total number of possible outcomes. This is equal to:\n\n$$\\frac{440}{1296} = \\frac{110}{324} = \\boxed{\\frac{55}{162}}$$",
    "To find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's, we can approach the problem by symmetry and complementary counting.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's, and let $B$ be the event that Greg rolls an equal number of 1's and 6's.\n\nSince each die has 2 favorable outcomes (1 and 6), the probability that Greg rolls at least one 1 and one 6 is $\\frac{2^4}{6^4}$.\n\nConsidering the complementary event of $B$ (i.e., either Greg rolls more 1's than 6's or more 6's than 1's), we denote the event that Greg rolls more 6's than 1's as $C$. Then $A$ and $C$ are mutually exclusive.\n\nThus, $P(A\\text{ or }C)=P(A)+P(C)$ because they have no outcomes in common.\n\nTo calculate the probability of the complementary event of $B$, let's first consider all the outcomes of the four dice.\n\nEvent $B$ occurs if two of the dice roll 1 and the other two roll 6, or if one die rolls 1, one die rolls 6, and the other two dice do not roll either 1 or 6.\n\nThe number of outcomes for event $B$ is the sum of the number of outcomes for each case:\n- Two dice roll 1, two dice roll 6: $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ outcomes\n- One die rolls 1, one die rolls 6, and the other two dice do not roll either 1 or 6: $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1}=12$ outcomes\n\nSo, the total number of outcomes for event $B$ is $6+12=18$.\n\nSince there are 6^4 total outcomes, we have\n$P(B)=\\frac{18}{6^4}=\\frac{3}{6^3}=\\frac{1}{72}.$\n\nWe can apply the same method to find $P(C)$.\nSince $P(A)+P(C)=P(A\\text{ or }C)=1-P(B),$ we have\n$P(A)=P(A\\text{ or }C)-P(C)=1-P(B)-P(C)$.\n\nBut $P(A\\text{ or }C)=1-P(B)$ since these events are complementary. Therefore,\n$P(A)=1-P(B)-P(C)=\\frac{69}{72}$.\n\nHowever, this probability is for the case of $A\\cup C$, but we wish to find the probability for the event $A$ specifically. We need to use symmetry, by showing that $P(A)=P(C)$."

  "solution": "We notice that the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's must equal the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's. So, we can find the probability that Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's, subtract it from 1, and divide by 2 to find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's. There are three ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's: he can roll two of each, one of each, or none of each. If he rolls two of each, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which two dice roll the 1's. If he rolls one of each, there are $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1}=12$ ways to choose which dice are the 6 and the 1, and for each of those ways there are $4\\cdot4=16$ ways to choose the values of the other dice. If Greg rolls no 1's or 6's, there are $4^4=256$ possible values for the dice. In total, there are $6+12\\cdot16+256=454$ ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's. There are $6^4=1296$ total ways the four dice can roll, so the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\left(1-\\dfrac{454}{1296}\\right)=\\boxed{\\dfrac{421}{1296}}$.",
