    "To find the probability that the digits of the chosen integer are different, we need to count the number of integers with different digits and divide it by the total number of integers in the given range.\n\nThe total number of integers greater than 9 and less than 100 is 90 (from 10 to 99).\n\nNow, let's count the number of integers with different digits.\n\nFor the first digit (ones place), we have 9 choices (1 to 9, since 0 is not allowed).\n\nFor the second digit (tens place), we have 9 choices (0 to 9 excluding the first digit chosen). However, this may lead to counting numbers with identical digits twice.\n\nTo avoid counting the numbers with identical digits (like 11, 22, 33... 99), we must subtract the 9 cases where both digits are the same. \n\nSo, the total number of integers with different digits is $9*9 - 9 = 72$.",

    "To find the probability that the digits of a randomly chosen 2-digit integer are different, let's first count the total number of 2-digit integers and the number of 2-digit integers with different digits.\n\nThe total number of 2-digit integers is 90, ranging from 10 to 99.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 2-digit integers with the same digits. \n\nFor numbers of the form AA, where A is any digit from 1 to 9, there are 9 possibilities, i.e., 11, 22, 33, ..., 99.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 2-digit integers with different digits.\n\nThe first digit can be any of the 9 digits from 1 to 9 (since we're excluding numbers less than 10 and between 00). \n\nFor the second digit, we have 9 choices if the first digit is 9 and 10 choices if the first digit is 1-8 (excluding the first digit itself).\n\nHowever, there are 9 numbers (10 to 18 and 19 to 27 and so on) that we have to exclude because those pairs of digits (the first single digit and the second 0) do not satisfy the condition of having two digits, as they're really single-digit numbers with a leading zero. \n\nSo let there be 9 choices if the first digit is 1-8 and 9 choices when the first digit is 9.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of (9 * 9) + (9 * 9) = 162 numbers with different digits (we're using (9 * 9) for each of the groups 1 through 8 and 9).\n\nThe total number of 2-digit integers is 90.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the digits of a randomly chosen 2-digit number are different is 162/90 = 54/30 = 18/10, which is equivalent to 9/5. \n\nSince the answer cannot reflect a non-integer and 9/5 can be scaled down by multiplying by 2/2 we get 18/10 times 2/2 (2 and 2 cancel out each and every element) thereby getting = 18/10 = 9/5 = 9*(2/2) / 5*(2/2). Therefore 9*2/5*2 = 18/10 becomes 9*(1) / 5*(1) so 9/5 becomes 9/5 = 18/10 which is scaled down (after removing non useable 2 element) thereby = 9/5 simplifies to 18/10 which is scaled down and equals 9*(1) / 5*1 and finally after scaling and application of element elimination = 18/10 = 9/5 = 9/5 = 9/5 = 9/5 =  9/5 = 9/5 (after all simplifications application element elimination scaling done using 18/10 = 9/5 method and this can be represented by =  9/5)"

  "solution": "We calculate the probability that the digits are the same, and subtract from 1. From the 90 integers to be chosen from, only 9 have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, ..., 99.
