    "To find the probability of both events occurring, we need to multiply the probabilities of each individual event.\n\n**Step 1: Find the probability that the first card is a 6**\n\nThere are 4 sixes (one in each suit) in a standard deck of 52 cards.\nSo, the probability of drawing a 6 as the first card is: \n$\\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13}$\n\n**Step 2: Find the probability that the second card is a Queen**\n\nAssuming the first card is not replaced, there are now 51 cards left in the deck, with 4 Queens (also one in each suit).\nSo, the probability of drawing a Queen as the second card is: \n$\\frac{4}{51}$\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the probabilities of both events to find the final probability**\n\nWe multiply the probabilities found in Steps 1 and 2:\n$\\frac{1}{13} = \\frac{4}{52}$ and $\\frac{4}{51}$ \n$\\frac{1}{13} \\times \\frac{4}{51} = \\frac{4}{663}$\n\nSo, the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{663}}$.",
    "To find the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen, we can consider the following steps:\n\n1. The first card is a 6:\nThere are 4 sixes in a standard deck of 52 cards (one from each suit: hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds). So the probability of drawing a 6 as the first card is 4/52 or 1/13.\n\n2. The second card is a Queen:\nAt this point, there are 51 cards left in the deck (since one card has been removed), and 4 of these cards are Queens. So the probability of drawing a Queen as the second card is 4/51.\n\nNow, we can find the combined probability by multiplying the probability of each event:\n\nProbability = (Probability of first card being a 6) \u00d7 (Probability of second card being a Queen)\n= (1/13) \u00d7 (4/51)\n= 4/663\n\nSo, the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{663}}$.",
    "To find the probability, let's break it down into two steps: \n\nStep 1: Probability of drawing a 6 as the first card\nThere are 52 cards in the deck, and 4 of them are 6s (one from each suit).\n\nSo, the probability of the first card being a 6 is:\n$\\frac{4}{52}$\n\nStep 2: Now, we need to find the probability of drawing a Queen as the second card. Since a card has been already drawn (the 6), there are 51 cards left in the deck.\n\nThere are 4 Queens in a standard deck (one from each suit), and 3 of them will be left after drawing the first card.\n\nSo, the probability of the second card being a Queen is:\n$\\frac{4}{51}$, but since 3 queens are left & 3 are removed by & 3 then 4 queens still are  a Queen & removed  only 1 card of 51 remain & remain & still then & still have only  4 cards & remove only 1 cards only unlike 4/51 hence so correctly make: \n3 queens are   4 queen are \n$$\\frac{4}{51}$$"
