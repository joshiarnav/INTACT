    "To find the number of ways you can choose a pair of socks of the same color, let's consider each color separately.\n\n1. **White socks**: Since we have 4 white socks, we can choose a pair of white socks in $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6$ ways. The pair can be one of the following combinations: (pair 1), (2), (3), (1,3), (1,4), or (2,4).\n\n2. **Brown socks**: Similarly, we can choose a pair of brown socks in $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6$ ways. The pair can be one of the following combinations: (pair 1), (2), (3), (1,3), (1,4), or (2,4).\n\n3. **Blue socks**: We have only 2 blue socks, so we can choose a pair of blue socks in $\\binom{2}{2} = \\frac{2!}{2!0!} = 1$ way.\n\nNow, let's add up the number of ways for each color:\n\n6 ways (white) + 6 ways (brown) + 1 way (blue) = 13 ways\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color is $\\boxed{13}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color. \n\n1. For the white socks, we need to choose 2 out of 4. This can be calculated using the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to choose. So, for the white socks, it's C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * 2!) = (4*3)/(2) = 6 ways.\n\n2. For the brown socks, we also need to choose 2 out of 4. Using the same combination formula, we get C(4, 2) = 6 ways.\n\n3. For the blue socks, we need to choose 2 out of 2, which is a special case because there's only one way to choose both socks. Hence, there's 1 way.\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color, we add the individual possibilities: 6 (white) + 6 (brown) + 1 (blue) = 13 ways.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{13}$ ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color from 4 white, 4 brown, and 2 blue socks.",
    "To choose a pair of socks of the same color, we need to consider the possibilities for each color separately. \n\nLet's start with the white socks. We have 4 white socks and we want to choose a pair of them. The number of ways to choose 2 out of 4 white socks is calculated using combinations, denoted as \"n choose r\" or C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!). For the white socks, this would be C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6.\n\nFor the brown socks, we also have 4 socks and we want to choose a pair. The number of ways to choose 2 out of 4 brown socks is also C(4, 2) = 6.\n\nFor the blue socks, we have 2 socks and we want to choose a pair. The number of ways to choose 2 out of 2 blue socks is C(2, 2) = 1.\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color, we need to add the number of ways for each color. \n\nTotal ways = ways for white + ways for brown + ways for blue = 4 + 6 + 1 = 11.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{11}$."

  "solution": "The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue.  If the socks are white, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are brown, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are blue, there is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ choice.  So the total number of choices for socks is $6 + 6 + 1 = \\boxed{13}$.",
