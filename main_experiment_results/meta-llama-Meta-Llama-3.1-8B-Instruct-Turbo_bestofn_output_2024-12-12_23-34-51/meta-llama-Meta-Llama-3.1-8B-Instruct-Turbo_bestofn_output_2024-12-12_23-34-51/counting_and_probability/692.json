    "To compute $\\dbinom{10}{5}$, we can use the formula for combinations:\n\n$\\dbinom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$\n\nWhere $n!$ represents the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.\n\nIn this case, $n = 10$ and $r = 5$. So, we have:\n\n$\\dbinom{10}{5} = \\frac{10!}{5!(10-5)!}$\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n$=\\frac{10!}{5!5!}$\n\nNow, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n$10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 3,628,800$\n\n$5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$\n\nNow, substitute the values:\n\n$= \\frac{3,628,800}{120 \\times 120}$\n\n$= \\frac{3,628,800}{14,400}$\n\n$= 252$\n\nSo, $\\dbinom{10}{5} = \\boxed{252}$.",

    "To compute $\\dbinom{10}{5}$, we'll first understand what it represents. The expression $\\dbinom{n}{r}$ is read as \"n choose r\" and represents the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items, without regard to the order.\n\nThe formula to calculate this is: \n$\\dbinom{n}{r} = \\dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$\n\nWhere $n!$ is the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nFor our problem, n = 10 and r = 5. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate 10!, which is:\n10! = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 3,628,800\n\nNow, we need to calculate 5!, which is:\n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n\nFinally, we need to calculate (10-5)!, which is 5!. We already calculated it.\n\nSo, let's plug in the numbers into the formula:\n$\\dbinom{10}{5} = \\dfrac{10!}{5!5!} = \\dfrac{3,628,800}{120 * 120}$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n$\\dbinom{10}{5} = \\dfrac{3,628,800}{14,400} = 252$\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n$\\boxed{252}$"
