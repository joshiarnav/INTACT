    "To find the number of ways George can choose two out of seven colors, we use the concept of combinations, denoted as \"n choose k\" or C(n, k). \n\nHere, n is the total number of colors, which is 7, and k is the number of colors George needs to choose, which is 2. \n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where \"!\" represents the factorial of a number.\n\nLet's apply the formula:\n- n! (7!) = 7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 5040\n- k! (2!) = 2*1 = 2\n- (n-k)! (5!) = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the formula:\nC(7, 2) = 5040 / (2 * 120) = 5040 / 240 = 21\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{21}$ ways for George to choose two out of seven colors to paint his room.",
    "To choose two colors out of seven, we need to use the concept of combinations. \n\nCombinations are calculated using the formula: \n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, r is the number of items being chosen, and '!' denotes factorial.\n\nIn this case, George has 7 colors (n=7), and he wants to choose 2 colors (r=2).\n\nSo, the number of ways George can choose two out of seven colors is: \n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!)\n         = (7x6x5x4x3x2x1) / ((2x1)x(5x4x3x2x1))\n         = (7x6) / (2x1)\n         = 21\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{21}$ ways for George to choose two out of seven colors to paint his room.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of combinations. Combinations are used when the order of selection doesn't matter.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to be selected, and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nIn this case, George wants to choose 2 colors out of 7. So, we can use the formula as follows:\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n7! = 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 5040\n2! = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n(7-2)! = 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120\n\nNow, let's substitute these values into the formula:\n\nC(7, 2) = 5040 / (2 \u00d7 120)\nC(7, 2) = 5040 / 240\nC(7, 2) = 21\n\nSo, the number of ways George can choose two colors out of seven colors is 21.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n$\\boxed{21}$"
