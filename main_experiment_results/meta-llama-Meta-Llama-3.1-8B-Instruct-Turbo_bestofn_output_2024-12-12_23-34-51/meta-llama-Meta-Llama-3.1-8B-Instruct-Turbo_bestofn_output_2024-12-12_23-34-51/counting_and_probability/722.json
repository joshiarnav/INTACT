    "To find the probability of drawing a $\\diamondsuit$ card first and an ace as the second card, we need to break down the problem into cases.\n\nCase 1: The first card is the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace.\n\nIn this case, the probability of the first card being the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is $\\frac{1}{52}$ (since there is 1 ace of $\\diamondsuit$ in the deck of 52 cards). \n\nNow, after drawing the ace of $\\diamondsuit$, there are 51 cards left. Among these, there are 3 aces left (one for each of the other suits). So, the probability of drawing an ace as the second card is $\\frac{3}{51}$.\n\nCombining these probabilities, we get the probability of Case 1: \n\n$\\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{3}{2652}$\n\nCase 2: The first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the ace of $\\diamondsuit$, and the second card is an ace.\n\nThe probability of drawing a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is $\\frac{12}{52}$ (since there are 12 other diamonds in the deck).\n\nAfter drawing a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the ace, there are 51 cards left, and there are 4 aces in the deck (since one of the aces has not been drawn yet). So, the probability of drawing an ace as the second card is $\\frac{4}{51}$.\n\nCombining these probabilities, we get the probability of Case 2: \n\n$\\frac{12}{52} \\times \\frac{4}{51} = \\frac{48}{2652}$\n\nNow, we need to add the probabilities of Case 1 and Case 2 to get the total probability. \n\n$\\frac{3}{2652} + \\frac{48}{2652} = \\frac{51}{2652}$\n\nSimplifying this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3, we get: \n\n$\\frac{51}{2652} = \\frac{17}{884}$\n\nSo, the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace is $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{884}}$.",

    "To find the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace, we will break down the problem into steps.\n\n1. **First Card**: \n- There are 52 cards in the deck, and 13 of them are $\\diamondsuit$ cards (Ace of $\\diamondsuit$, 2-10 of $\\diamondsuit$, and the Jack, Queen, and King of $\\diamondsuit$).\n- The probability of drawing a $\\diamondsuit$ card as the first card is: \n  - $\\text{P}(\\text{first card is a}~ \\diamondsuit) = \\frac{13}{52}$ \n  - Simplify the fraction: \n  - $\\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n2. **Second Card**: \n  a. **If the first card is an Ace of $\\diamondsuit$**:\n  - In this scenario, there are 51 cards left in the deck.\n  - Since the first card was the Ace of $\\diamondsuit$, the second card cannot be an Ace of $\\diamondsuit$.\n  - There are 3 Aces in the remaining deck (in the other suits).\n  - Therefore, the probability of drawing an Ace as the second card is: \n   - $\\text{P}(\\text{second card is an Ace}) = \\frac{3}{51}$ \n   - Simplify the fraction: \n   - $\\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{1}{17}$\n\n  b. **If the first card is any other $\\diamondsuit$ card**:\n  - In this scenario, the number of cards in the deck remains the same: 51 cards.\n  - Since there was a $\\diamondsuit$ card drawn in the first step, there are still 4 Aces in the remaining deck.\n  - Therefore, the probability of drawing an Ace as the second card is: \n   - $\\text{P}(\\text{second card is an Ace}) = \\frac{4}{51}$\n\n3. **Combining the probabilities**:\n  - There are two cases to consider:\n  a. The first card is the Ace of $\\diamondsuit$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{52}$ (since there's only 1 Ace of $\\diamondsuit$ in the deck and the probability space for this specific card is 1/52).\n  b. The first card is any other $\\diamondsuit$ card with a probability of $\\frac{12}{52}$.\n  - Therefore, the combined probability of these cases is: \n    $\\left(\\frac{1}{52}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{17}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{12}{52}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{51}\\right)$\n\n  - Now let's simplify the combined probability expression: \n    $\\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{1}{17} + \\frac{12}{52} \\times \\frac{4}{51}$ \n    = $\\frac{1}{884} + \\frac{48}{2652}$ \n    = $\\frac{1}{884} + \\frac{4}{221}$ \n    = $\\frac{1}{884} + \\frac{8}{442}$ \n    = $\\frac{1}{884} + \\frac{16}{884}$ \n    = $\\frac{17}{884}$ \n\n  - Now simplify this fraction: \n    $\\frac{17}{884} = \\frac{17}{4 \\times 13 \\times 17}$ = $\\frac{1}{4 \\times 13}$ = $\\frac{1}{52}$"

  "solution": "We have two cases because if the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$, it could be an ace or not be an ace.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{3}{51} = \\dfrac{1}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the three remaining aces, which gives a probability of $\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot \\dfrac{1}{17} = \\dfrac{1}{884}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{12}{52} = \\dfrac{3}{13}$ chance that a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the ace is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{4}{51}$ chance that an ace is drawn second, giving a $\\dfrac{3}{13}\\cdot \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{4}{221}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nSo the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\\dfrac{1}{884} + \\dfrac{4}{221} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}$.\n\nNotice that we can avoid some of the large denominators above by organizing this computation as follows: $$\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{3}{51}+\\dfrac{12}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{1\\cdot 3+12\\cdot 4}{52\\cdot 51} = \\dfrac{51}{52\\cdot 51}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}.$$",
