  "problem": "Define a $\\it{good\\ word}$ as a sequence of letters that consists only of the letters $A$, $B$, and $C$ --- some of these letters may not appear in the sequence --- and in which $A$ is never immediately followed by $B$, $B$ is never immediately followed by $C$, and $C$ is never immediately followed by $A$. How many seven-letter good words are there?",

    "To find the number of seven-letter good words, we can break down the process step by step.\n\nFor the first letter, we have 3 choices (A, B, or C).\n\nFor the second letter, given the first letter, we have to consider the constraints.\n\n- If the first letter is A, the second letter can be A or C (2 choices): A or C\n- If the first letter is B, the second letter can be A or B (2 choices): A or B\n- If the first letter is C, the second letter can be B or C (2 choices): B or C\n\nAs you can see, no matter what the first letter is, we have 2 choices for the second letter. \n\nApplying this logic recursively, we see that for any position in the sequence (except the first), we have 2 choices for the letter.\n\nSo, for a seven-letter sequence, \n1. The first letter has 3 choices.\n2. The second to the seventh letters have 2 choices each.\n\nSo, the total number of good words is $3 \\cdot 2^6$.\n\n$3 \\cdot 2^6 = 3 \\cdot (64) = 3 \\cdot 64 = 192.$\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{192}$ seven-letter good words.",
    "To find the total number of seven-letter good words, we will calculate the possibilities for each letter and use the product rule for counting. \n\nFor the first letter, we have 3 possibilities: A, B, or C.\n\nFor the second letter, we have to consider the previous letter and the rule that A cannot be followed by B, B cannot be followed by C, and C cannot be followed by A. \n\n- If the first letter is A, the second letter can be A or C, so we have 2 possibilities.\n- If the first letter is B, the second letter can be A or B, so we have 2 possibilities.\n- If the first letter is C, the second letter can be B or C, so we have 2 possibilities.\n\nThis pattern continues for the rest of the letters. \n\n- For the third letter, if the previous letter is A, we have 2 possibilities; if the previous letter is B, we have 2 possibilities; if the previous letter is C, we have 2 possibilities.\n- For the fourth letter, if the previous letter is A, we have 2 possibilities; if the previous letter is B, we have 2 possibilities; if the previous letter is C, we have 2 possibilities.\n- For the fifth letter, if the previous letter is A, we have 2 possibilities; if the previous letter is B, we have 2 possibilities; if the previous letter is C, we have 2 possibilities.\n- For the sixth letter, if the previous letter is A, we have 2 possibilities; if the previous letter is B, we have 2 possibilities; if the previous letter is C, we have 2 possibilities.\n- For the seventh letter, if the previous letter is A, we have 2 possibilities; if the previous letter is B, we have 2 possibilities; if the previous letter is C, we have 2 possibilities.\n\nAt first glance, we might think to multiply 3 by 2 six times, but that would overcount the sequences, because each of them could be the last letter. A better approach is to multiply 3 by 2, 5 times and by 3 for the final time (for the last letter there is no previous letter because there would be no following so it is not an issue like in the A B C scenarios for all other letters except this final scenario). \n\nSo, the total number of good words is $3 \\times 2^6 \\times 3 = \\boxed{3 \\times 2^6 \\times 3 = 432}$",
    "To find the number of 7-letter good words, let's analyze the possibilities for each position.\n\n- The first letter can be any of $A$, $B$, or $C$, so there are 3 possibilities for the first letter.\n- For the second letter, given the first letter, there are 2 possibilities:\n  - If the first letter is $A$, then the second letter cannot be $B$, so it can be either $A$ or $C$. Therefore, there are 2 possibilities.\n  - If the first letter is $B$, then the second letter cannot be $C$, so it can be either $A$ or $B$. Therefore, there are 2 possibilities.\n  - If the first letter is $C$, then the second letter cannot be $A$, so it can be either $B$ or $C$. Therefore, there are 2 possibilities.\n- Following the same reasoning, for the third letter, given the second letter, there are 2 possibilities for each combination of the first two letters.\n- The same pattern continues up to the seventh letter.\n\nSo, the number of 7-letter good words can be found by multiplying the possibilities for each position:\n\n3 (first letter) * 2 (second letter) * 2 (third letter) * 2 (fourth letter) * 2 (fifth letter) * 2 (sixth letter) * 2 (seventh letter)\n\n3 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 3 * 2^6 = 3 * 64 = 192.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{192}$ seven-letter good words."
