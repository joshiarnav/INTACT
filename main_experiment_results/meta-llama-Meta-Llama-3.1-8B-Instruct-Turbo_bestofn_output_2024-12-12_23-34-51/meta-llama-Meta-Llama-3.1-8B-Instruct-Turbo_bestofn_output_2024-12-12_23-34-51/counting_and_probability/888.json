    "To find the least number of colors needed to shade the tessellation such that no two tiles sharing a side are the same color, we can analyze the pattern of the tessellation.\n\nThe given tessellation seems to be a repeating pattern of hexagonal tiles, which alternate in direction along the x-axis and y-axis. Each hexagon shares sides with six other hexagons, which can be seen by drawing a grid around them. \n\nGiven this arrangement, the minimum number of colors needed for a hexagonal tessellation is two.  When such a pattern forms, because it repeats, you will see that with any two colors, these criteria are met.",
    "To determine the minimum number of colors needed, we need to understand the structure of the given tessellation. The tessellation consists of a repeating pattern of parallelograms (also known as rhombic tessellations).\n\nWe can color these parallelograms in a way that ensures no two adjacent ones share the same color. \n\nHere's the coloring strategy:\n\n1. The bottom-most row has two parallelograms that are adjacent to each other, so they must be different colors. Let's call one color A and the other color B.\n2. Moving up to the next row, we can see that each parallelogram now has a different color from its adjacent neighbors. They must be A or B. The left and right most parallelograms in this row will be the same color (one of A or B), while the middle two will be the different color (the other of A or B). This has a cascading effect in subsequent rows, so that the color A identifies every other row, whereas B identifies every other row as well.\n\nBy using this alternating pattern of colors in every other row, no two adjacent parallelograms will share the same color.\n\nThis means the least number of colors needed is 2.",
    "To determine the least number of colors needed for this tessellation, we need to consider how the tiles are arranged and how they share sides with each other. \n\nFirst, we need to recognize the pattern of the tessellation. It consists of hexagonal tiles arranged in a repeating pattern, with each row shifted slightly compared to the one below it. This creates a repeating hexagonal lattice.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of colors needed. If we start with a single tile at the top, we can color it with one color. The tiles directly below it will have to share a side, so they will have to be colored differently. \n\nIf we continue this pattern, we can see that each row of tiles must be colored differently from the one above it and the one below it, to prevent two adjacent tiles from sharing the same color.\n\nHowever, the tiles in each column (when viewed vertically) do not share a side, but they do share vertices. To find the least number of colors needed to shade this tessellation, observe that with only one row of tiles colored differently, you could color each column of tiles with the same color to avoid sharing sides, but not with different rows of tiles to maintain the uncolored condition. It turns out that you need at least two colors.\n\nThat's why two colors are sufficient for the given tessellation because with two colors, each row will be a different color from the one above and below it, ensuring that no two tiles sharing a side have the same color.\n\n$\\boxed{2}$"

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I can conclude that all three solutions are correct. However, I will select the best solution based on clarity and conciseness.\n\nSolution 1 is a good attempt, but it could be more concise. It starts by analyzing the pattern of the tessellation, which is correct, but it could be more direct in its conclusion.\n\nSolution 2 is a good solution, but it's a bit more complicated than necessary. The coloring strategy is creative, but it's not the most straightforward approach.\n\nSolution 3 is the most concise and direct solution. It starts by recognizing the pattern of the tessellation, and then it clearly explains why two colors are sufficient. This solution is easy to follow and understand.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 3. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 3.",
  "solution": "Clearly one color isn't enough; $\\boxed{2}$ colors will work because the tessellation shown is topologically identical to a chessboard (that is, imagine straightening out the diagonal lines to form an array of squares. This process doesn't change which tiles share a side.).",
