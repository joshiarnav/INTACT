    "To find the probability that the result is a composite number, we can first find the probability that the result is not a composite number, which is easier. \n\nA composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. We can count the total number of outcomes where the result is not a composite number.\n\nSince we roll 5 dice, the result will be a composite number if and only if one of the following conditions is met: \n\n- At least four dice show a 1, and the fifth die shows either a 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n- One die shows a 4, and the other four dice show a 1. This is the probability of (4,1,1,1,1), (1,4,1,1,1), (1,1,4,1,1), (1,1,1,4,1), (1,1,1,1,4).\n\nHowever, we can simplify this by first getting the number of outcomes where all the dice show 1 or where all the dice show 4, respectively.\n\nThe number of ways to roll (1,1,1,1,1) is $1^5=1$ way. This means that there is one outcome in which all the dice show 1.\n\nThe number of ways to roll (4,1,1,1,1), (1,4,1,1,1), (1,1,4,1,1), (1,1,1,4,1), (1,1,1,1,4)  is $5\\cdot 1^4=5$ ways. This means that there are 5 outcomes in which one die shows 4 and the rest show 1.\n\nSo there are 1 + 5 = 6 outcomes in which the product is either 1 or 4, which are not composite numbers.\n\nNow, we can count the total number of possible outcomes when rolling 5 dice. Each die has 6 possible outcomes, so the total number of possible outcomes when rolling 5 dice is $6^5=7776$. \n\nSince there are 6 outcomes where the product is a non-composite number, and 7776 total outcomes, the probability that we get a non-composite number is $\\frac{6}{7776}$.\n\nHowever, the probability that the product IS composite, is the complement of the probability that we get a non-composite number. Hence, to get the probability we wanted, we simply subtract the probability of getting a non-composite number from 1.\n\nSo, the probability that the product IS composite is $1-\\frac{6}{7776}=\\frac{7770}{7776}\\approx 0.998$.\n\nNow, express the final answer in the requested $\\boxed{answer}$ format: \n\nThe probability that the result is a composite number is $\\boxed{\\frac{7770}{7776}}$.",

The remaining three can be in a non-composite way, as for them to have a product that is composite, you would need a 2, 3, or 5, and the other pair showing a prime, or for all three showing a composite, in which case one of those dice would need to be divisible by another for their product to be composite (This part was misleading in the initial thought, let's correct).

    "To find the probability that the product of 5 dice is a composite number, we need to find the total number of outcomes and then subtract the number of outcomes where the product is not composite. \n\n1. First, let's find the total number of possible outcomes: \nEach die has 6 possible outcomes, and we are rolling 5 dice. So the total number of outcomes is $6^5 = 7776$.\n\n2. Now, let's find the number of outcomes where the product is not composite: \nA composite number is a product of at least two prime numbers. Therefore, the product will not be composite if we get multiple 1s and one 5; or one 2 and four 1s, or two 5s are also composite, but we can not get two 5s since the five values we rolled must be in $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$, (any other values are invalid), but we can have one 5 in 5 possible ways and this is invalid, so now we check other ways.\n\nNow let's analyze how we get an invalid product: \n- A 5 in any of the five positions (one 5), since this makes a product that is multiple of 5 and we need a; (product (1,2,3,4,5) (1,2,3,4,6) and so on this; isn't, (since, prime numbers in this product aren't),  since there isn't a prime number in (1,2,3,4) five values that rolled so then isn\u2019t).

  "solution": "While it is almost tempting to make this into the casework problem to end all casework problems, using complementary probability makes the problem a lot simpler, so we will find the probability that the product is not composite.\n\nIt's clear that if more than one die shows a roll greater than 1, the resulting product will have more than one factor that is greater than 1 and therefore be composite. Additionally, if any of the dice show a 4 or a 6, the product will obviously be composite. So in order for the product to not be composite, we need at least four dice to be a 1 and the fifth die to either be another 1 or a 2, a 3, or a 5.\n\nThere's exactly one way in which all the the dice can be 1's, and for each of the other three cases there are 5 ways since the die that isn't a 1 can appear in any of the 5 other positions, so there are a total of $3\\cdot5+1=16$ ways of rolling the dice that result in a product that isn't composite. Additionally, there are 6 options for the roll of each of the 5 dice for a total of $6^5=7776$ possible outcomes, which means that the probability of the product not being composite is $\\dfrac{16}{7776}$ and the probability that it is composite is $1-\\frac{16}{7776}=\\frac{7760}{7776}=\\boxed{\\frac{485}{486}}$.\n\nNote: Many students have tried to argue that 1 is not a prime number and should not be counted.
