    "To determine the difference between the total number of green tiles and the total number of blue tiles in the new figure, we need to first identify the total number of blue and green tiles in the original figure.\n\nWe are given 13 blue and 6 green hexagonal tiles in the original figure. \n\nThe new figure will have a border of green tiles. To create a border around the figure, 18 green tiles will be added (6 on each of the 3 sides with 2 added on the last side to complete the border since it is cut short and the previous 6 on each side already included in the previous 6 to be used for each side). This gives a total of 6 (original green tiles) + 18 (additional green tiles for border) = 24 green tiles.\n\nThe number of blue tiles remains unchanged at 13.\n\nThe difference between the total number of green tiles and the total number of blue tiles in the new figure will be 24 (total green tiles) - 13 (total blue tiles) = 11.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the total number of green tiles and the total number of blue tiles in the new figure is 11.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$",
    "To solve the problem, let's first calculate the total number of blue and green tiles in the original figure.\n\nThe total number of blue tiles is 13.\n\nThe total number of green tiles is 6.\n\nIn the original figure, each edge has two green tiles for the border and one inner tile is blue. The new border of green tiles will cover all the blue inner tiles on the edge. This is to say, along the blue tiles' length, it is going to have 2 green tiles from the new border along with the existing 1 green tile. So each blue tile is going to be surrounded by green tiles with 2 green tiles from the new border and 1 existing green tile, for a total of 3 green tiles per blue tile for this scenario.\n\nTo cover all the current blue tiles' length, it is going to have 2 new green tiles per blue tile. For 13 blue tiles, that is 2 * 13 = 26 green new tiles.\n\nThere are 6 current green tiles to make up the length that needs to be completely covered.\n\nHowever, to find the difference between the total number of green tiles and the total number of blue tiles, we need to consider that there are also green tiles on the top and bottom of the inner blue tiles. To calculate these numbers, we can see that there are 7 blue tiles and 6 green tiles across the length (from left to right). \n\nIf one green tile is considered as the center tile, then there will be 6 green tile on either side, making a total of 13 green tiles on either side. For the 7 blue tiles in the middle, each one of these will be surrounded by the inner green tile, along with the 2 tiles from the top and bottom border for a total of 3 green tiles. However, for every blue tile, there are 2 green tiles on the left and 2 green tiles on the right, making a total of 4 green tiles on either side. For 7 blue tiles, we get a total of 28 green tiles that need to be in the middle, and this number is added to the 13 that are currently on the length already included in side totaled green tile. This gives a total of 41 green tiles that need to be included. For the green tile that is considered as the center tile, there needs to be 3 new green tiles on either side of it.  These tiles are only for the  middle green tile and not for the blue tiles in between. This makes it a total of 6 new green tiles.\n\nNow, if we find the total of green tiles by adding the current green tiles, the green tiles for the length, and the tiles for the center, we get 6 + 26 + 6 and this totals up to 38 green tiles to be added.\n\nWe already have 6 green tiles, so we add the number of new green tiles to current green tiles for a total, 6 + 38, and this equals 44 green tiles.\n\nThere are still 13 blue tiles.\n\nTo find the difference between the total number of green tiles and the total number of blue tiles in the new figure, we can subtract the total number of blue tiles (13) from the total number of green tiles (44). \n\n44 - 13 = 31.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the total number of green tiles and the total number of blue tiles in the new figure is 31.",
    "Let's start by analyzing the figure. It consists of a grid of hexagonal tiles, with 13 blue tiles and 6 green tiles. \n\nWhen a border of green tiles is added to the figure, the number of green tiles increases. To find the number of tiles used for the border, we need to consider the shape of the border.\n\nThe figure has 6 rows of tiles, and the border will have an inner hexagon shape, where the tiles are one row \"in from\" each edge. \n\nLooking at the hexagons in the figure, each one has 6 sides, but the \"gaps\" between the hexagons can be seen as being composed of equilateral triangles, which have 3 sides each. The border \"adds\" one or two equilateral triangles, depending on where you are on the figure. \n\nLet's focus on the horizontal edges of the hexagons. Along these edges, there are six triangles on the outside that are part of the border. Notice that these are also part of the original border that was there. However, when adding the new border, the number of triangles for the outer border of the figure is doubled to six on each side and also the inner border. Therefore that is a total of 12 new triangles for the figure's outer border.\n\nNow we move on to the other sides. Each triangle that makes up the border that isn't along the edge of the figure will have two \"neighbors\", one in front of it and one behind it. When you add a triangle to the front or the back, that's also one that is part of the original border. This is because there are six equilateral triangles \"between\" the hexagons and therefore six new ones to add on each of the sides. \n\nTaking into account both the top and the bottom there are six that \"are essentially in the middle\". These we have to account for last.\n\nThe number of equilateral triangles that are part of the border is 6 sides x 6 new triangles (or in the case of the \"edges\") and 6 sides x 6 \"in between\" triangles on each of the sides. Notice that the 6 'middle' triangles right in the middle have already been accounted for. That is a total of 6 sides x 6 new = 36 + 6 sides x 6 in between = 78 total triangles in the border's 6 other sides. \n\nBut remember, there are six outer right side edges. And then, we also have to count the six triangles on the opposite side. There are 12 in the horizontal length. On the other sides, with the six right side outer edges and the opposite side. That leaves us with the corners of the figure. The number of corner tiles is 4 (at the top and bottom and also at the left and right) that are also made of triangles.\n\nFor the corners, that equates to 1 \"new triangle\" in each of the four corners, because we don't count the triangle on the inside 'again'. So right off the bat, we see we have to count 4 corner triangles or 4 that in the middle of the right hand side border and also are at the middle of the outer left sides.\n\nIn that case, there are 12 \"outer edges\" we have to count. And, then we count 4 for the corners. \n\nBut there are also 12 outer edges, and 6 sides to count in the other \"horizontal\" edges in the other sides. Taking into account the other \"horizontal\" edges in the other sides \"in between\" or right in the middle of the hexagons in the figure. It 'better' if we could try a better description of the problem so the description is accurate for the sides where there are two equilateral triangles in the same place \"to the 'left' or 'right' so you can see where we get the sides coming from."
