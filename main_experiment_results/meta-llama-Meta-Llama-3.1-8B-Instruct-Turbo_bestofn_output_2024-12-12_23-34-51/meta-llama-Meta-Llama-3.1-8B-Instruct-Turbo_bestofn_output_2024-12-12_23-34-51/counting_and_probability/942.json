    "To find the number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set, we can consider the differences from the lowest to the highest.\n\nThe smallest positive difference we can get is by subtracting consecutive numbers, which will be 1 (e.g., 2 - 1 = 1, 3 - 2 = 1).\n\nThe largest positive difference we can get is by subtracting the smallest number from the largest, which will be 16 - 1 = 15.\n\nNow, we need to consider all the possible positive integers from 1 to 15. However, we don't necessarily get all of them. \n\nTo get all the possible positive integers from 1 to 14, consider the following:\n\n- 16 - 1 = 15\n- 16 - 2 = 14\n- 16 - 3 = 13\n- 16 - 4 = 12\n- 16 - 5 = 11\n- 16 - 6 = 10\n- 16 - 7 = 9\n- 16 - 8 = 8\n- 16 - 9 = 7\n- 16 - 10 = 6\n- 16 - 11 = 5\n- 16 - 12 = 4\n- 16 - 13 = 3\n- 16 - 14 = 2\n- 16 - 15 = 1\n\nSince all the positive integers from 1 to 14 are represented as differences of two distinct members, we can say that the number of different positive integers that can be represented is 14.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider if there are any differences that can be represented that are not included in the list above (i.e., are greater than 15). \n\nSince the largest difference we can get is 15, we can conclude that any difference greater than 15 cannot be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set.\n\nTherefore, the number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members is 14.\n\n$\\boxed{14}$",
    "To find the number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 14, 15, 16 \\}$, we'll consider the possible differences.\n\nThe smallest difference is obtained by subtracting the smallest element from the second smallest element, which gives us $2 - 1 = 1$. The largest difference is obtained by subtracting the smallest element from the largest element, which gives us $16 - 1 = 15$.\n\nWe can observe that the difference between any two elements in the set is confined within the range from 1 to 15. This is because the difference between the largest and smallest elements (16 and 1) is 15, and the set contains all integers from 2 to 16, ensuring that the difference is always between 1 and 15.\n\nNow, let's count how many integers in this range can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set. Since the smallest difference is 1 and the largest difference is 15, we can represent all integers in the range from 1 to 15.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that we are not counting any duplicate differences. Since we are dealing with distinct members of the set, we will never obtain a duplicate difference.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set is equal to the number of integers in the range from 1 to 15. \n\nThis can be calculated by simply counting the integers in this range.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",
    "To find the number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the given set, we need to consider the maximum and minimum possible differences.\n\nThe minimum possible difference is $1$, which occurs when we subtract the smallest number in the set from the next largest number (1 and 2, 2 and 3, and so on until 15 and 16).\n\nThe maximum possible difference is $15$, which is obtained by subtracting the smallest number in the set from the largest number (1 and 16).\n\nNow, let's analyze the differences obtained by subtracting each number in the set from the consecutive larger numbers. The sequence of differences from 1 to 15 will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.\n\nNotice that each number from $1$ to $15$ is covered exactly once in this sequence. The smallest difference, $1$, is covered when 1 is subtracted from the consecutive larger number, 2. The largest difference, $15$, is covered when 1 is subtracted from the largest number in the set, 16.\n\nAlso, the magnitude of the differences does not change if we consider the subtraction of any other pair of distinct elements because we are getting the same absolute difference.\n\nTherefore, we have a total of 15 different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the given set.\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I can confirm that all three solutions reach the correct conclusion, but they go about it in slightly different ways.\n\nSolution 1 and Solution 3 both consider the differences obtained by subtracting each number in the set from the consecutive larger numbers. They both conclude that each number from 1 to 15 is covered exactly once in this sequence, resulting in a total of 15 different positive integers.\n\nSolution 2 takes a more general approach, observing that the difference between any two elements in the set is confined within the range from 1 to 15. It then concludes that since the smallest difference is 1 and the largest difference is 15, we can represent all integers in the range from 1 to 15.\n\nAll three solutions are correct, but Solution 3 is the most straightforward and intuitive. It explicitly shows the sequence of differences from 1 to 15, making it easier to understand why each number in this range is covered exactly once.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 3.\n\nThe answer is: 3",
