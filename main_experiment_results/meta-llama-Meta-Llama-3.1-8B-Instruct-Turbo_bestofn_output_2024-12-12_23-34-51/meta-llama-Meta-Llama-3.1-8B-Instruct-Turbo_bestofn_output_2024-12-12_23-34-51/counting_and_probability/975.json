    "Step 1:  In this problem, we are given a figure consisting of hexagons, where each hexagon is colored either red, yellow, or green. The constraint is that no two hexagons with a common side can have the same color.\nStep 2:  We are also given that the hexagon labeled with the letter \"R\" is colored red. Our task is to determine the number of different ways the figure can be colored while satisfying the given conditions.\nStep 3:  Let's start by focusing on the hexagons that share an edge with the hexagon labeled \"R\". Since these hexagons cannot have the same color as the \"R\" hexagon, they must be colored either yellow or green.\nStep 4:  Looking at the upper-left hexagon, we see that it shares a side with the \"R\" hexagon. Therefore, it must be colored either yellow or green. This choice determines the color of the remaining hexagon in the first column.\nStep 5:  Moving to the top-right hexagon, we see that it shares a side with the \"R\" hexagon and the previously colored yellow or green hexagon. Therefore, it must be colored the remaining color between the two possibilities - yellow and green.\nStep 6:  We now realize that once the color of the upper-left hexagon is chosen, the colors of the rest of the hexagons are determined.\nStep 7:  This insight simplifies our task as we only need to consider the possible choices for the upper-left hexagon to count the different ways the figure can be colored.\nStep 8:  The upper-left hexagon can be either yellow or green; there are no other possibilities.\nStep 9:  Therefore, there are only $2$ different ways to color the figure.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

    "To find the number of ways the figure can be colored, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\nGiven that the hexagon with the R is colored red, we know that its adjacent hexagons cannot be red as well since no two hexagons with a common side are colored the same color.\n\nNow, let's look at the hexagons directly above and below the given red hexagon. There are two possibilities:\n\n- If the top hexagon is red's neighboring color, it has to be yellow since the one below it (red hexagon's neighboring) must be green to avoid a common side from having the same color, which shows that color red is paired with colors green and yellow. Therefore our choices for top/bottom spots (not including red hexagon) are, green and yellow.\n\n1. The figure will be painted as follows: \n * The color of the top left hexagon can be yellow or green.\n * The color of the top middle hexagon is determined by the color of the top left hexagon.\n * The color of the top right hexagon is determined by the color of the top middle hexagon and hence of the top left hexagon as well.\n * The same logic applies for the bottom left, middle, and right hexagons.\n\nFor a given choice of color for the top left hexagon, there are exactly 2 ways to color the entire figure: one way with the top left hexagon colored yellow and another with the top left hexagon colored green.\n\nSince we have two choices of color for the top left hexagon, the total number of ways to color the figure is 2.\n\n- If the top hexagon is green, then the bottom hexagon must be yellow, as the given red hexagon's neighboring spots require that red (being hexagon R's color) only paired with the hexagnos colored green or yellow as the paired colors to the spot immediately adjacent such spots due to spots having common sides.\n\n2. In terms of pairing, \n  - The top row must include the top center hexagon as the yellow hexagon as the red hexagon colored red is colored from the yellow green and red sequence.\n  - The top right hexagon is green given the configuration and our rules.\n\n- In pairing from left to right across the given choices, color green is the paired color to our right of the color of yellow \n   The second pairing pairing and hence our coloring from right to left with the center hexagons, is as follows \n   - Along the bottom center of the figure given choices are the paired colors, the spots immediately beneath the colored green spots given to the left in the top row we see pairing works from left to right. \n   - Then the paired choices are as follows since we now have established two equal pairs of green and yellow to represent a given figure (not counting red)\n    The second pairing and pairing hence our coloring from left to right with the second row \n    - Along the bottom row since we are coloring the immediately beneath figure beside and the colored hexagon with paired hexagon green shows as follows since the sequence of colors from top to bottom is green red (being central colored green red yellow) pairing and hence our coloring from right to left with the second row colored red \n    - Then the second pairing and the color is yellow with paired hexagon yellow shows as follows sequence from top to bottom \n\nTherefore our given choice configuration and our given rules we have only two possible paired colorings across across the figure given choices. \n\n[asy]\npath a=(0,0)--(10,0)--(15,8.7)--(10,17.3)--(0,17.3)--(-5,8.7)--cycle;\ndraw(a);\ndraw(shift((15,8.7))*a);\ndraw(shift((15,-8.7))*a);\ndraw(shift((30,17.3))*a);\ndraw(shift((30,0))*a);\ndraw(shift((30,-17.3))*a);\ndraw(shift((45,26))*a);\ndraw(shift((45,8.7))*a);\ndraw(shift((45,-8.7))*a);\ndraw(shift((60,17.3))*a);\ndraw(shift((60,0))*a);\ndraw(shift((60,-17.3))*a);\ndraw(shift((75,8.7))*a);\ndraw(shift((75,-8.7))*a);\ndraw( shift((5 ,38.6))*a);\ndraw( shift((35,38.6))*a);\ndraw(shift((35, -8.7))*a);\ndraw(shift((50,  8.7))*a);\ndraw(shift((50, -8.7))*a);\nlabel(\"$R$\",(5,10),S);\ndraw(shift((75, 8.7))*a);\ndraw(shift((-5,17.3))*a);\n\n[/asy]\n\nOur valid choice with our rules coloring and configurations with two figure given colored pairs with paired rules applied shows and hence from the two valid given configurations the correct answer is : \n\n$\\boxed{2}$"

  "solution": "The hexagons in the second column to the left must be yellow and green, but either color can be on top: 2 possibilities. With either possibility, the rest of the figure is easily colored in, with the color of every other hexagon being forced.  (ex. In the third column, the middle hexagon must be red, and the top and bottom must be the opposite of the top and bottom in the second column)  Thus, there are only $\\boxed{2}$ possibilities.",
