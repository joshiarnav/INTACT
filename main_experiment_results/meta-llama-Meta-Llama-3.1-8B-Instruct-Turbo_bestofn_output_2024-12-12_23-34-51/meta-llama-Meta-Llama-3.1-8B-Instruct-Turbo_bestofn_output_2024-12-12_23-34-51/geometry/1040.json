    "To find the perimeter of the equilateral triangle, we need to first find the length of one of its sides.\n\nSince the area of the equilateral triangle is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides, let's call this side length 's'. Then, the area of the triangle (A) is also 's'. \n\nThe formula for the area of an equilateral triangle with side length 's' is:\n\nA = (\u221a3)/4 * s^2\n\nGiven that the area is equal to the side length 's', we can set up the equation:\n\ns = (\u221a3)/4 * s^2\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation. Divide both sides by s:\n\n1 = (\u221a3)/4 * s\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n4 = (\u221a3) * s\n\nNow, divide both sides by \u221a3:\n\n4 / \u221a3 = s\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \u221a3:\n\n(4 * \u221a3) / (\u221a3 * \u221a3) = s\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(4 * \u221a3) / 3 = s\n\nNow that we have the side length 's', we can find the perimeter of the equilateral triangle. Since it's an equilateral triangle, all three sides are equal. Therefore, the perimeter (P) is:\n\nP = 3 * s\n\nSubstitute the value of 's':\n\nP = 3 * (4 * \u221a3 / 3)\n\nP = 4 * \u221a3\n\nNow that we have the perimeter in simplest radical form, we can write the final answer in the required format:\n\n$\\boxed{4 \\sqrt{3}}$",
    "To find the perimeter of the equilateral triangle, we first need to find the length of one side. Let's denote the length of a side as 's'. \n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle with side length 's' is given by the formula:\n\nArea = (s\u00b2 * \u221a3) / 4\n\nWe are given that the area of the triangle is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides. Therefore, we can set up an equation:\n\n(s\u00b2 * \u221a3) / 4 = s\n\nTo simplify, we can multiply both sides by 4:\n\ns\u00b2 * \u221a3 = 4s\n\nNext, we can move all terms to one side of the equation by subtracting 4s from both sides:\n\ns\u00b2 * \u221a3 - 4s = 0\n\nWe can then factor out 's' from the equation:\n\ns(\u221a3s - 4) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\n\ns = 0 (not possible since we can't have a side length of 0)\n\u221a3s - 4 = 0\n\nWe can solve the second equation for 's':\n\n\u221a3s = 4\ns = 4 / \u221a3\n\nWe can rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by \u221a3:\n\ns = (4 * \u221a3) / (\u221a3 * \u221a3)\ns = (4 * \u221a3) / 3\n\nNow that we have the length of one side, we can find the perimeter of the triangle by multiplying the side length by 3 (since it's an equilateral triangle):\n\nPerimeter = s + s + s\nPerimeter = 3s\nPerimeter = 3 * ((4 * \u221a3) / 3)\n\nSimplifying the equation by canceling out the 3 in the numerator and denominator:\n\nPerimeter = (4 * \u221a3)\n\nThe perimeter of the equilateral triangle, in simplest radical form, is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$.",
    "To find the perimeter of the equilateral triangle, we first need to determine the length of one of its sides.\n\nLet's denote the length of one side of the equilateral triangle as 's'. We are given that the area of the equilateral triangle is numerically equal to the length of one side, which means that:\n\nArea = s\n\nThe formula to calculate the area of an equilateral triangle with side length 's' is given by:\n\nArea = (\u221a3 * s^2) / 4\n\nNow, since we are given that the area is numerically equal to the side length, we can set up the equation:\n\ns = (\u221a3 * s^2) / 4\n\nWe can multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n4s = \u221a3 * s^2\n\nNow we want to isolate s. If we divide both sides by s, we get the equation\n\n4 = \u221a3 * s\n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle with side length 's' is then:\n\ns = (4) / (\u221a3)\n\nTo simplify the expression, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying all (via the conjugate), \n\nWe then get\n\ns = (4 * \u221a3) / (\u221a3 * \u221a3)\ns = (4 * \u221a3) / (3)\n\nAfter this step, we no longer require the original 's.' Since it is now a fact we have an equilateral triangle, and we know the equation to find the side length, we may use the fact that an equilateral triangle has equal sides, so that a side length of the triangle is equal to the thing that the formula is looking to receive as the variable; this fact pertains to all equilateral triangles."
