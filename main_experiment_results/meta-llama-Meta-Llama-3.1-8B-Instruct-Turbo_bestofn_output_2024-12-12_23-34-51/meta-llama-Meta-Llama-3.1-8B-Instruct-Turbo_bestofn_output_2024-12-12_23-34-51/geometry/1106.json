    "To find the value of AE, we first need to understand what happens when the square is folded.\n\nSince the sides AD and CD coincide and lie on diagonal BD, triangles ADE and CDE are congruent by SSS congruence (Side-Side-Side).\n\nTriangle BDE is also a right triangle, and its hypotenuse is the same as the diagonal of the square.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the square as 's', which is 1 unit in this case.\n\nSince BD is the diagonal of the square, using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nBD\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + AD\u00b2\nBD\u00b2 = 1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2\nBD\u00b2 = 2\nBD = \u221a2 units\n\nSince triangles ADE and CDE are congruent, then DE = CD - CE.\n(As the square's side is given as s =1 unit, we can express this taking our given values).\nAlso, taking into consideration that AD = CD = 1 unit (equal to DE too as previously calculated), let x be the length of AE (which is also the length of CF).\n\nGiven these are right triangles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the relationship:\n(AB)\u00b2 + (x)\u00b2 = (AD)\u00b2\n(1-x)\u00b2 + (x)\u00b2 = 1\u00b2\nExpanding this,\n1-2x + x\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 1\nExpanding this,\n2x\u00b2 -2x = 0\nx(2x -2) = 0 \n\nTherefore, we have \u2219 either x = 0 or 2x - 2 = 0.\nConsidering our given scenario of our right triangle structure, only the latter fits. \n\nHence, \nx = 1 - x\n2x = 2 \nx = 1.",
    "To solve the problem, let's consider the given square $ABCD$. \n\nFirst, let's determine the relationship between the folded square and the segments $AE$ and $CF$. \n\nSince the square is folded along $DE$ and $DF$, sides $AD$ and $CD$ coincide and lie on diagonal $BD$. Therefore, $AE=CF=x$, where $x$ is the length of $AE$. The coinciding segments are $DE$ and $EB$, with $DE=EB=x$. \n\nWe can notice that triangles $\\triangle ADE$ and $\\triangle DFC$ are congruent by side-side-side (SSS) congruence since $AD=DC=1$, $DE=EB=x$, and $FD=DC=1$. Also, $\\triangle CFD$ and $\\triangle ADE$ are congruent.\n\nLetting $x=AE=CF$, and $y=EF$, $\\angle AED = \\angle CFD$ since $AE=CF$, and $DA=FC$ since we're folding along $DF$. In the diagram $C'F$ and $A'D$ after folding. This gives us that $\\triangle ADE \\sim \\triangle DFC$ by the angle-angle similarity criterion.\n\nNext, let's consider that $\\triangle ADE \\sim \\triangle B'DE$; therefore, $BD'/DE \\stackrel{\\text{AA}}{=} BD/DE$. Now, $\\triangle B'DE \\sim \\triangle FDE$ since $\\angle FDE \\cong \\angle B'DE$ and $\\angle DFE \\cong \\angle DDE$. \n\nSince $BD'/DE=BD/DE=DFDE$, we have $DD'/FF'=1$ by the similar triangles equality of ratios of corresponding segments. Now, let's compute $DD'$ length. From the right isosceles triangle $\\triangle DFD$, we know that $DD'+DF=DF$. Since $DD'=FF'=1$, we obtain $DF=1/DD'$. \n\nFurther, let $x=AE=CF$ be the length of $AE$. Observe that $\\triangle ADF$ and $\\triangle CDF$ are congruent as $\\overline{AD} \\cong \\overline{CD}$ and $DF$ are common sides; therefore, $\\triangle ADF \\sim \\triangle CDF$. From $\\triangle ADF \\sim \\triangle CDF$, it follows that $DF/DF=AF/CF \\implies 1=AF/CF$.\n\nIn $DF/(-FF')=DD'/(-DD')$, let $DF=-FF'=1/DD'$ and $DD'=-DD'$, then it follows that $DD'=1/DF=\\frac{-1}{DD'}$.\n\nIt can be shown that the length of $AE$ can be represented as $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} - 1}$. To obtain this, let's use the following fact: \n\n$$\n\\left(\\sqrt{2}-1\\right) \\left(\\sqrt{2} + 1 \\right) = \\left(\\sqrt{2}+1\\right) \\left(\\sqrt{2} + \\left(-1\\right)\\right)\n =2-1^2=2-1\n$$\n\nRecall that $(\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}+1)=\\left(\\sqrt{2}\\right)^2-1^2=2-1=1$.\n\nLet $x=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} - 1}$, then:\n$$\nx\\left(\\sqrt{2}-1\\right)=1\n$$\n\nRecall that $(\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}+1)=1$, so \nthe above equation can be written as \n$$\n\\left(x\\left(\\sqrt{2}-1\\right)\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{2}+1\\right)=1\\left(\\sqrt{2}+1\\right)\n$$\nUsing the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can expand the left-hand side as follows:\n$$\n\\left(x\\left(\\sqrt{2}-1\\right)\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{2}+1\\right)=\\left(x\\cdot \\sqrt{2}\\right)-\\left(x\\cdot 1\\right)\n$$\n\nNow, using the $x=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}-1}$ we found earlier. This allows us to simplify the left-hand side as \n$$\n-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}-1}\\right)+\\left(\\sqrt{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}-1}\\right)=\\left(x\\cdot \\sqrt{2}\\right)-\\left(x\\cdot 1\\right)=\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}-1}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}-1}\\right)\n$$\nusing the distributive property again, the right-hand side simplifies to\n$$\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}-1}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}-1}=\\frac{\\left(\\sqrt{2}-1\\right)-1}{\\sqrt{2}-1}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}-2}{\\sqrt{2}-1}\n$$\nSince we know that the final desired solution is $\\sqrt{k} - m$, it is clear that k=2 and m=1",
    "To find the length of segment $AE$, we can start by drawing a diagram of the folded square.\n\nLet $x$ be the length of $AE$ and $CF$. Since the folded square forms a right-angled triangle, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to the triangle $\\triangle BDF$.\n\nWe have $DF = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$ and $BF = 1 - CF = 1 - x$.\nApplying the Pythagorean theorem, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\nBD^2 &= DF^2 + BF^2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 1^2 &= (\\sqrt{2})^2 + (1 - x)^2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 1 &= 2 + (1 - x)^2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (1 - x)^2 &= -1 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 1 - x &= \\pm i \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nHowever, lengths cannot be complex numbers, so we made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLooking back at the problem, we see that when we folded the square along lines $DE$ and $DF$, the sides $AD$ and $CD$ coincided on diagonal $BD$. This means that the triangles $\\triangle BDF$ and $\\triangle EFD$ are similar.\n\nLet's use this fact instead. By similarity, we have\n\n$$\\frac{BF}{BD} = \\frac{FD}{DE} \\Rightarrow \\frac{1-x}{1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1}.$$\n\nHowever, this is also incorrect.\n\nWe must examine this similarity condition more carefully. By the given folding, the triangle $\\triangle BED$ is formed with right angle at $D$. In this triangle $\\triangle BED$, we have that the sides $BD$ and $DE$ are of length $1$, which gives us\n\n$$\\frac{BF}{1} = \\frac{FD}{BF - x}.$$\n\nUsing this relationship, we obtain the equation to solve for $x$:\n\n$$\\frac{1 - x}{1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1 - x}$$\n\nThe relationship between $BF$ and $FD$ is as follows: \n\n$$1-(x) = (\\sqrt{2})(1-x)$$\n\nThis equation can be rewritten and simplified in the following way:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n1-x&=(\\sqrt{2})(1-x)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x(1-\\sqrt{2})&=(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=\\frac{(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{(1-\\sqrt{2})}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\cdot \\frac{-(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{-(\\sqrt{2}-1)}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=\\frac{-(\\sqrt{2}-1)^2}{(\\sqrt{2}-1)}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=\\frac{-2+2\\sqrt{2}-1}{(\\sqrt{2}-1)}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=\\frac{-3+2\\sqrt{2}}{(\\sqrt{2}-1)}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=\\frac{-(3-2\\sqrt{2})}{(1-\\sqrt{2})}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=\\frac{3-2\\sqrt{2}}{(\\sqrt{2}-1)}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=\\frac{(3-2\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{2}+1)}{(\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}+1)}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}+3-4}{2-1}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=\\frac{3(\\sqrt{2}+1)-4}{1}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=3(\\sqrt{2}+1)-4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=3\\sqrt{2}+3-4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=3\\sqrt{2}-1.\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe value of $k$ is $3$ (that of $3\\sqrt{2}$) and $m$ is $1$.

We are looking for the length of $AE$, so let $AE=x$.  Then, $BE=1-x$.  Because of the symmetry of the square and the fold, everything to the left of line $BD$ is a mirror image of everything to the right of $BD$.  Thus, $\\triangle BEF$ is an isosceles right triangle (45-45-90), so $EF=\\sqrt{2}EB = \\sqrt{2}(1-x)$.  Also, $\\triangle EGB$ and $\\triangle FGB$ are congruent 45-45-90 triangles, so $GB = \\frac{EB}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nAlso, notice that because the way the paper is folded (its original position versus its final position), we have more congruent triangles, $\\triangle AED \\cong \\triangle GED$.
