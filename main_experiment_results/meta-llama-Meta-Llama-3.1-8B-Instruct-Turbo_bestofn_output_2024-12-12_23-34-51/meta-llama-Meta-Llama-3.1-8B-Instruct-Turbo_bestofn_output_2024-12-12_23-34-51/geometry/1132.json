    "To find the point $D$ with coordinates $(m,n)$ inside triangle $ABC$ such that the areas of the small triangles $ABD$, $ACD$, and $BCD$ are all equal, we need to find the centroid of triangle $ABC$. The centroid is the point of intersection of the medians of a triangle, and it divides each median into two segments, one of which is twice the length of the other, with the longer segment being between the vertex and the centroid.\n\nTo find the centroid, we first need to find the coordinates of the midpoints of the sides of the triangle. \n\nThe midpoint of segment $AB$ is given by the formula:\n\\[M_{AB} = \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5+3}{2}, \\frac{8+(-2)}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{8}{2}, \\frac{6}{2}\\right) = (4, 3)\\]\n\nThe midpoint of segment $AC$ is given by the formula:\n\\[M_{AC} = \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5+6}{2}, \\frac{8+1}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{11}{2}, \\frac{9}{2}\\right) = (5.5, 4.5)\\]\n\nThe midpoint of segment $BC$ is given by the formula:\n\\[M_{BC} = \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3+6}{2}, \\frac{(-2)+1}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}, \\frac{-1}{2}\\right) = (4.5, -0.5)\\]\n\nNow, we can find the centroid $D$ by averaging the $x$-coordinates and the $y$-coordinates of the midpoints. The centroid will be located at:\n\\[D = \\left(\\frac{4 + 5.5 + 4.5}{3}, \\frac{3 + 4.5 + (-0.5)}{3}\\right)\\]\n\n\\[D = \\left(\\frac{14}{3}, \\frac{7}{3}\\right)\\]\n\nWe are asked to find the value of $10m + n$. So, we need to substitute the values of $m$ and $n$:\n\\[10m + n = (10\\cdot\\frac{14}{3}) + \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{140}{3} + \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{147}{3} = 49\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $10m + n$ is 49.\n\\boxed{49}",

    "To find the point $D$ that divides each of the three small triangles $ABD$, $ACD$, and $BCD$ into equal areas, we need to find the centroid of triangle $ABC$.

  "solution": "If $D$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, then $ABD$, $ACD$, and $BCD$ would all have equal areas (to see this, remember that the medians of a triangle divide the triangle into 6 equal areas). There is only one point with this property (if we move around $D$, the area of one of the small triangles will increase and will no longer be $1/3$ of the total area). So $D$ must be the centroid of triangle $ABC$.
