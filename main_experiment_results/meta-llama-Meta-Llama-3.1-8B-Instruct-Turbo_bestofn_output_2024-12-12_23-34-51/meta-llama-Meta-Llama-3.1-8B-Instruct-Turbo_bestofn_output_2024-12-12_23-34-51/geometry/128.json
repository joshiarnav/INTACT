    "To find the radius of each smaller mold, we'll need to calculate the volume of the larger hemisphere-shaped bowl and then divide it by 27 to get the volume of each smaller mold.\n\n1. The volume of a hemisphere with radius \\( r \\) is given by the formula: \n   \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3\\)\n\n2. Given the radius of the larger bowl is 1 foot, its volume can be calculated as:\n   \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\pi(1)^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi \\) cubic feet.\n\n3. Since the chocolate is evenly distributed between 27 smaller hemisphere-shaped molds, the total volume of the larger bowl must be divided by 27 to find its volume:\n   \\(\\frac{\\frac{2}{3}\\pi}{27} = \\frac{2\\pi}{81}\\) cubic feet.\n\n4. This volume is now the volume of one smaller mold. Set the smaller mold's volume equal to the hemisphere-shaped mold volume equation and solve for r:\n   \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{2\\pi}{81}\\)\n\n5.

    "To find the radius of the smaller molds, we need to calculate the volume of the original hemisphere-shaped bowl and then divide it by 27 to find the volume of each smaller mold. We can then use the volume formula for a hemisphere to find the radius of each smaller mold.\n\n1. The formula for the volume of a hemisphere with radius r is given by: \n   V = (2/3) * \u03c0 * r\u00b3\n\n2. Since the radius of the original hemisphere-shaped bowl is 1 foot, we can plug this value into the volume formula:\n   V_original = (2/3) * \u03c0 * (1)\u00b3\n   V_original = (2/3) * \u03c0 * 1\n   V_original = (2/3) * \u03c0\n\n3. Now, let's divide the original volume by 27 to find the volume of each smaller mold:\n   V_smaller = V_original / 27\n   V_smaller = ((2/3) * \u03c0) / 27\n   V_smaller = (2 * \u03c0) / (3 * 27)\n   V_smaller = (2 * \u03c0) / 81\n\n4. Since we know that the volume of each smaller mold is (2 * \u03c0) / 81, we can use the formula for the volume of a hemisphere to find the radius. \n   V_smaller = (2/3) * \u03c0 * r\u00b3 (where r is the radius of each smaller mold)\n   (2 * \u03c0) / 81 = (2/3) * \u03c0 * r\u00b3\n\n5. Let's cancel out the common factor of 2/3 from both sides:\n   r\u00b3 = (3/81) * (81/1)\n   r\u00b3 = (3/1)\n\n6. Taking the cube root of both sides, we can find the radius of each smaller mold:\n   r = \u221b(3/1)\n   r = \u221b3\n\nNow, to get the numerical value of r, we will represent it as a decimal.
