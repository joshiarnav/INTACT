    "First, we find $\\angle PRQ$. In a triangle, the sum of the interior angles is $180^\\circ$. Given that $\\angle PQR = 63^\\circ$ and $\\angle QPR = 59^\\circ$, we can find $\\angle PRQ$ by subtracting the given angles from $180^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle PRQ = 180^\\circ - 63^\\circ - 59^\\circ = 58^\\circ$.\n\nSince $\\angle PRQ = 58^\\circ$, the arc $PQ$ subtends an angle $2 \\times 58^\\circ = 116^\\circ$ at the center of the circle $C$.\n\nAs $\\angle QRC$ is an angle at the center of the circle, it is equal to twice the angle at the circumference subtended by the same chord ($PQ$). So $\\angle QRC = 2\\times\\angle PQR = 2\\times 63^\\circ = 126^\\circ$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{126}$",
    "To find $\\angle QRC$, we first note that, in a triangle, an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle, and an angle subtended by an arc at the center is double the angle subtended by the same arc at the circumference.\n\nSince the circle with center $C$ is tangent to $\\overline{PQ}$, $\\overline{QR}$, and $\\overline{RP}$, the angles $\\angle PCQ$, $\\angle QCQ$, and $\\angle RCQ$ are all right angles.\n\nGiven that $\\angle PQR = 63^\\circ$, notice that the angle subtended by arc $PR$ at the circumference is $180^\\circ - 63^\\circ - 59^\\circ = 58^\\circ$. The central angle for the same arc, $\\angle PCR$, is therefore $58^\\circ \\times 2 = 116^\\circ$.",
    "To find $\\angle QRC$, we first need to find the third angle of triangle $PQR$, $\\angle PRQ$.\n\nSince the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we can calculate it by subtracting the given angles from $180^\\circ$:\n\n$\\angle PRQ = 180^\\circ - \\angle PQR - \\angle QPR$\n$= 180^\\circ - 63^\\circ - 59^\\circ$\n$= 58^\\circ$\n\nNow that we have all the angles of triangle $PQR$, we can see that $\\angle CPR$ is $90^\\circ$ since it is formed by the radius of the circle and the tangent line at point $R$.\n\nAlso, since $C$ is the center of the circle, $C$ is the incenter of triangle $PQR$. This means that $\\angle QRC = \\angle PRQ$, which we already calculated to be $58^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $\\angle QRC$ is $\\boxed{58}$."
