    "To find the area of the hexagon, we can break down the figure into smaller shapes and calculate the total area.\n\n1. First, let's identify the shapes around the hexagon. We can see that the hexagon is surrounded by a square with side length $4$, and four triangles with side length $1$. \n\n2. Next, let's find the area of the square. The area of a square is given by the formula $side \\times side$, so the area of this square is $4 \\times 4 = 16$ square units.\n\n3. Now, we need to find the area of the four triangles. Each triangle is a right-angled triangle with base $1$ and height $3$, so the area of each triangle is given by the formula $0.5 \\times base \\times height$. Therefore, the area of each triangle is $0.5 \\times 1 \\times 3 = 1.5$ square units. Since there are four triangles, the total area of the triangles is $4 \\times 1.5 = 6$ square units.\n\n4. To find the area of the hexagon, we need to subtract the area of the triangles from the area of the square. Therefore, the area of the hexagon is $16 - 6 = \\boxed{10}$ square units.",
    "To find the area of the given hexagon, we can divide it into smaller shapes whose areas are easy to calculate. \n\nFirst, let's break the hexagon into smaller triangles. The hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles with side length 1 unit each.\n\nWe can see that there are 4 small triangles on the top (one of which is partially shaded) and 2 small triangles in the bottom right, outside the hexagon. \n\nThese four small triangles on top add up to the area of a square with side length 2 units. So, the area of the top 4 small triangles is $(2 \\times 2)/2 = 2$ square units.\n\nNow we can observe that the hexagon can be formed by removing a triangle from the square with the top 4 triangles, and two small triangles from the large square on the bottom left. \n\nNotice, that the triangle which is inside the hexagon and outside the square has side length 1 unit, hence it has an area of $\\frac{1}{2}$ square units.\n\nNow we can see that for the lower part of the Hexagon we would have an area of a trapezium with height 6 units and the trapezium's height limits being 3.3 and 2.7. \n\nSo, we have the area of the trapezium which is being partially shaded with the formula $\\frac{(a+b)h}{2}$ which is $\\frac{(2.7 + 3.3) * 6}{2} = 21$ square units.\n\nUsing this method, We can see that the total area of the Hexagon is $2 + 21 - \\frac{1}{2}$ = $21\\frac{3}{2}$ =  $21.5$ = $42 \\div 2$ = $\\boxed{21.5}$",
    "To find the area of the hexagon, we can break it down into smaller shapes. \n\nFirst, let's find the area of the red triangle and the four blue triangles as follows:\n\nThe area of the large triangle (green) can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle which is $A = 1/2 \\cdot \\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}$. \n\nSo, the area of the large triangle is $A_{1} = 1/2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4 = 12$ square units.\n\nThe area of the small triangle can be calculated using the same formula: \n\n$A_{2} = 1/2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3 = 1.5$ square units.\n\nNow we can calculate the area of the four blue triangles which are $A_{4} = 2 \\cdot 1.5 = 3$ square units.\n\nThe area of the large red triangle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle which is $A = 1/2 \\cdot \\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}$. \n\nSo, the area of the large red triangle is $A_{3} = 1/2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4 - 2 \\cdot 1.5 = 9$ square units.\n\nThe area of the hexagon will be the area of the large triangle minus the area of the four blue triangles plus the area of the large red triangle.\n\nRemember that the area of the large triangle is 12 square units and the area of the blue triangles is 3 square units and the area of the large red triangle is 9 square units. \n\nSo, the area of the hexagon is $A_{\\text{hexagon}} = A_{1} - A_{4} + A_{3}$ square units.\n\nSubstituting the values of $A_{1}$, $A_{4}$, and $A_{3}$ into the formula:\n\n$A_{\\text{hexagon}} = 12 - 3 + 9$ square units.\n\nEvaluating the expression on the right-hand side:\n\n$A_{\\text{hexagon}} = 18$ square units.\n\nTherefore,  $\\boxed{18}$."
