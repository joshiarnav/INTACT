  "problem": "Jimmy owns a cube-shaped container that measures $10$ inches on each side. He fills this container with water until it is half full. Then he throws ten giant ice cubes that measure $2$ inches on each side into the container. In inches cubed, how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water?",

    "To find the unoccupied volume in the container, we first need to find the total volume of the container, the volume of water in the container, and the volume of the ice cubes. \n\n1. **Total Volume of the Container:**\n   The formula for the volume of a cube is length * width * height. Since the container is a cube with 10 inches on each side, the volume of the container is:\n   Volume = length * width * height = 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000 cubic inches\n\n2. **Volume of Water in the Container:**\n   Since the container is half full, the volume of water in the container is half of the total volume:\n   Volume of water = Total Volume / 2 = 1000 / 2 = 500 cubic inches\n\n3. **Volume of the Ice Cubes:**\n   There are ten giant ice cubes each measuring 2 inches on each side. The volume of each ice cube is:\n   Volume of each ice cube = length * width * height = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 cubic inches\n   The total volume of the ten ice cubes is:\n   Volume of ice cubes = 10 * volume of each ice cube = 10 * 8 = 80 cubic inches\n\n4. **Total Occupied Volume:**\n   The total occupied volume is the sum of the volume of water and the volume of ice cubes:\n   Total occupied volume = volume of water + volume of ice cubes = 500 + 80 = 580 cubic inches\n\n5. **Unoccupied Volume:**\n   Finally, to find the unoccupied volume, we subtract the total occupied volume from the total volume of the container:\n   Unoccupied volume = Total Volume - Total occupied volume = 1000 - 580 = 420 cubic inches\n\nTherefore, the volume of the container unoccupied by ice or water is $\\boxed{420}$.",
    "To find the volume of the container unoccupied by ice or water, we'll first find the total volume of the container, then the volume occupied by water, and the volume occupied by the ice cubes.\n\n1. Find the total volume of the container: \nVolume = side^3 \n= 10^3 \n= 1000 cubic inches\n\n2. Find the volume occupied by water (half the container):\nVolume = 1000 / 2 \n= 500 cubic inches\n\n3. Find the volume occupied by one giant ice cube:\nVolume = side^3 \n= 2^3 \n= 8 cubic inches\n\n4. Find the volume occupied by ten giant ice cubes:\nVolume = 8  *  10 \n= 80 cubic inches\n\n5. Calculate the occupied volume of container by water  and  ten giant ice cubes:\nOccupied volume = Volume of water + Volume  of ten ice cubes \n= 500 + 80 \n= 580 cubic inches\n\n6. Calculate the unoccupied volume of container:\nUnoccupied volume = Total volume - Occupied volume \n= 1000 - 580 \n= 420 cubic inches \n\nTherefore, the volume of the container unoccupied by ice or water is $\\boxed{420}$.",
    "To find the unoccupied volume in the container, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total volume of the container: \nSince the container is a cube with each side measuring 10 inches, we can find the volume by cubing the length of a side: \nVolume of container = side^3 = 10^3 = 1000 cubic inches\n\n2. Calculate the volume of water in the container: \nSince the container is half full, we can find the volume of water by dividing the total volume by 2:\nVolume of water = volume of container / 2 = 1000 / 2 = 500 cubic inches\n\n3. Calculate the volume of one giant ice cube: \nSince each ice cube is a cube with each side measuring 2 inches, we can find the volume of one ice cube by cubing the length of a side: \nVolume of one ice cube = 2^3 = 8 cubic inches\n\n4. Calculate the total volume of ten giant ice cubes: \nSince there are ten ice cubes, the total volume is ten times the volume of one ice cube:\nVolume of ten ice cubes = 10 * volume of one ice cube = 10 * 8 = 80 cubic inches\n\n5. Calculate the total occupied volume in the container: \nSince the container contains water and ten ice cubes, we can find the occupied volume by adding the volume of water and the volume of the ten ice cubes:\nOccupied volume = volume of water + volume of ten ice cubes\n= 500 + 80\n= 580 cubic inches\n\n6. Calculate the unoccupied volume in the container: \nSince the container has a total volume of 1000 cubic inches and an occupied volume of 580 cubic inches, we can find the unoccupied volume by subtracting the occupied volume from the total volume:\nUnoccupied volume = volume of container - occupied volume\n= 1000 - 580\n= 420 cubic inches\n\nTherefore, the unoccupied volume in the container is $\\boxed{420}$ cubic inches."

  "critique": "Each solution is correct in terms of the final answer, which is 420 cubic inches. However, we can analyze them for clarity, conciseness, and adherence to mathematical principles.\n\nSolution 1 is clear and step-by-step, but it has some unnecessary repetition in the calculations for the total volume of the container and the volume of the ice cubes.\n\nSolution 2 is concise and to the point, but it doesn't explain the reasoning behind the calculations as clearly as Solution 1.\n\nSolution 3 is also clear and concise, but it has some minor errors in the formatting and organization of the steps.\n\nBased on the analysis, Solution 1 is the most detailed and easy to follow, but it has some redundancy in the calculations. Solution 3 is a close second, but it has some minor errors in formatting.\n\nHowever, considering the overall clarity and conciseness, I would select Solution 2 as the best solution.\n\nSo, the index number of the best solution is: **2**",
  "solution": "First let's compute the volume of the container. The container measures $10\\times10\\times10$ so its volume is  $$10\\cdot10\\cdot10=10^3=1000$$inches cubed. Since the container is only half full, there are $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10^3=500$$inches cubed of water in it. Additionally, there are ten ice cubes each with a volume of $2^3$. This means that the total volume of the ice cubes is $$10\\cdot2^3=10\\cdot8=80.$$Altogether, the water and the ice cubes occupy $500+80=580$ inches cubed. This means that there are $1000-580=\\boxed{420}$ inches cubed of space in the container unoccupied by water and ice.",
