    "To solve this problem, let's denote the length, width, and height of the rectangular box as $l$, $w$, and $h$ respectively.\n\nStep 1: The sum of the lengths of the twelve edges of the box is given by $4l + 4w + 4h = 140$. We can simplify this to $l + w + h = 35$.\n\nStep 2: The distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner can be found using the three-dimensional version of the Pythagorean theorem: $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = 21$. Squaring both sides, we get $l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = 441$.\n\nStep 3: We can now use the first equation ($l + w + h = 35$) to find an expression for $(l + w + h)^2$:\n\n$l^2 + w^2 + h^2 + 2(lw + lh + hw) = 35^2$\n\nStep 4: From Step 2, we know that $l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = 441$. Substituting this into the result from Step 3:\n\n$441 + 2(lw + lh + hw) = 35^2$\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation further:\n\n$2(lw + lh + hw) = 1225 - 441$\n\n$2(lw + lh + hw) = 784$\n\n$lw + lh + hw = 392$\n\nStep 6: The total surface area of the box is given by $2lw + 2lh + 2hw$. Note that this is twice the value of $lw + lh + hw$. \n\nTotal surface area $= 2 \\times 392 = 784$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{784}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's start by considering the given information.\n\n1. The sum of the lengths of the twelve edges of a rectangular box is $140$. A rectangular box has $4$ edges of each of $3$ dimensions, so let $a$, $b$, and $c$ denote the lengths of the edges. Then we have \n\n$$4a + 4b + 4c = 140.$$\n\nSimplifying this equation gives us \n\n$$a + b + c = 35.$$\n\n2. The distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner is $21$, which can be expressed as the space diagonal of the box. Using the three-dimensional distance formula, we have\n\n$$\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = 21.$$\n\nSquaring both sides of this equation gives us \n\n$$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 441.$$\n\nNow we need to express the total surface area of the box in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$. \n\nThe total surface area of a rectangular box is the sum of the areas of its faces. Since there are $2$ faces of each of the three dimensions, the total surface area of the box can be expressed as \n\n$$2(ab + bc + ac).$$\n\nTo solve for the surface area in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$, let's square the equation $a + b + c = 35$. This gives us\n\n$$(a + b + c)^2 = 1225.$$\n\nExpanding the left-hand side of this equation yields \n\n$$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ac = 1225.$$\n\nWe can substitute the value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ from the previous equation into this equation, which gives us \n\n$$441 + 2(ab + bc + ac) = 1225.$$\n\nSubtracting $441$ from both sides of this equation gives us \n\n$$2(ab + bc + ac) = 784.$$\n\nDividing both sides of this equation by $2$ gives us \n\n$$ab + bc + ac = 392.$$\n\nFinally, substituting this expression into the formula for the total surface area of the box gives us \n\n$$2(ab + bc + ac) = 2(392) = 784.$$\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the box is $\\boxed{784}$.",
    "To find the total surface area of the box, we can start by using the given information. Let's denote the lengths of the three edges of the box as $x$, $y$, and $z$.\n\nGiven that the sum of the lengths of the twelve edges of the box is $140$, we can write the following equation:\n\n$x + x + y + y + z + z = 140$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$2x + 2y + 2z = 140$\n\nDivide by $2$:\n\n$x + y + z = 70$\n\nGiven that the distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner is $21$, we can also use the three-dimensional distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem in a three-dimensional space. The formula is:\n\n$\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 21$\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 441$\n\nThe total surface area of the box is the sum of the areas of all the faces. The box has six faces, and each face is a rectangle. The area of each face is equal to the product of the two dimensions:\n\n$A = xy + yz + zx$\n\nHowever, we need to find a way to relate this to the given information. Since we have the equation $x + y + z = 70$ (from the edges) and $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 441$ (from the distance), we can try squaring the first equation:\n\n$(x + y + z)^2 = 70^2$\n\nExpand the equation:\n\n$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy + 2yz + 2zx = 4900$\n\nSubstitute the value $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 441$ from the distance equation:\n\n$441 + 2xy + 2yz + 2zx = 4900$\n\nSubtract $441$ from both sides:\n\n$2xy + 2yz + 2zx = 4460$\n\nDivide by $2$:\n\n$xy + yz + zx = 2230$\n\nNow we have an expression for the total surface area of the box:\n\n$A = xy + yz + zx = 2230$\n\nSo, the total surface area of the box is $2230$.\n\n$\\boxed{2230}$"
