    "To find the new volume, we'll start by finding the original volume of the cylinder. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nGiven that the original volume is 10 cubic feet, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n\u03c0r^2h = 10\n\nNow, let's find the new volume when the radius is doubled (2r) and the height is tripled (3h).\n\nThe new volume formula will be \u03c0(2r)^2(3h), which simplifies to 12\u03c0r^2h.\n\nWe can substitute the original volume equation into this new equation:\n\n12\u03c0r^2h = 12(\u03c0r^2h)\n= 12 * 10\n= 120\n\nSo the new volume of the cylinder is 120 cubic feet.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{120}$.",
    "To find the new volume, we first need to know the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nGiven the original volume is 10 cubic feet, we can denote the original radius as r and the original height as h. So, we can write the equation as follows:\nV = \u03c0r\u00b2h = 10 cubic feet\n\nNow, the radius is doubled to 2r and the height is tripled to 3h.\n\nSo, the new volume will be:\nV_new = \u03c0(2r)\u00b2(3h)\n      = \u03c04r\u00b23h\n      = 12\u03c0r\u00b2h\n      = 12 * 10 cubic feet\n      = 120 cubic feet\n\nTherefore, the volume of the cylinder after the change in radius and height is 120 cubic feet.\n\n\\boxed{120}",
    "To find the new volume of the cylinder, we need to recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nThe original volume was 10 cubic feet, so we can express it as V = \u03c0r\u00b2h = 10.\n\nNow, we are given that the radius of the cylinder is doubled (i.e., r' = 2r) and its height is tripled (i.e., h' = 3h).\n\nWe need to find the new volume, V', in terms of the dimensions of the new cylinder.\n\nUsing the formula for the volume of a cylinder, we get V' = \u03c0(r')\u00b2(h').\n\nSubstituting r' = 2r and h' = 3h, we get V' = \u03c0(2r)\u00b2(3h).\nV' = \u03c0(4r\u00b2)(3h).\nV' = 12\u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\nNow, we know that the original volume was V = \u03c0r\u00b2h = 10.\nTherefore, the new volume V' is 12 times the original volume:\nV' = 12(\u03c0r\u00b2h) = 12 \u00d7 10 = 120.\n\nSo, the new volume of the cylinder is 120 cubic feet.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{120}$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and arrive at the same answer, 120 cubic feet. However, the best solution is Solution 1. It is the most concise and clearly explains the steps involved in finding the new volume. The language used is also easy to understand, making it a well-written solution.",
  "solution": "Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively.  The new cylinder has volume \\[\n\\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\\pi r^2 h,\n\\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume.  Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.",
