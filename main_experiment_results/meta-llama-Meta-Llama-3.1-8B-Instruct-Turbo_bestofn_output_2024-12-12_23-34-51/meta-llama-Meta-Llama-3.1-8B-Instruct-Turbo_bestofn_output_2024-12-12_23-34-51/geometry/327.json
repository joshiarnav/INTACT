    "To solve the problem, we will first determine the points of intersection between the given square and the line $y = \\frac{x}{2}$. We will then calculate the lengths of each side of one of the congruent quadrilaterals, add them up and divide by $a$ to obtain our answer.\n\nThe intersection points between the square and the line $y = \\frac{x}{2}$ can be found by considering the x-coordinates of the square's vertices.\n\n- For $x=-a$, $y = \\frac{-a}{2}$.\n- For $x=a$, $y = \\frac{a}{2}$.\n\nSince the line $y = \\frac{x}{2}$ intersects the square at $x=-a$ and $x=a$, we can calculate the side lengths of the quadrilateral.\n\n- The side length between $(-a, -a)$ and $(-a, \\frac{-a}{2})$ is $\\frac{-a-a}{2} = -\\frac{a}{2} = a/2$.\n- The side length between $(-a, \\frac{-a}{2})$ and $(a, \\frac{a}{2})$ can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem as the line forms a right angle triangle with these points. $\\sqrt{(a+(-a))^2 + (a/2 - (-a/2))^2} = \\sqrt{(2a)^2 + a^2} = \\sqrt{4a^2 + a^2} = \\sqrt{5a^2} = a\\sqrt{5}$.\n- The side length between $(a, \\frac{a}{2})$ and $(a,a)$ is $a-(a/2) = a/2$.\n- The side length between $(a, a)$ and $(-a,a)$ is $2a$.\n\nThe perimeter of one of the congruent quadrilaterals can be obtained by adding the side lengths we calculated, then dividing by $a$.\n\nPerimeter = $(a/2 + a\\sqrt{5} + a/2) + 2a$\n\nPerimeter $= a\\sqrt{5} + 3a$\n\nPerimeter divided by $a = \\frac{a\\sqrt{5} + 3a}{a}$\n\nTherefore, the required perimeter divided by $a$ equals $\\boxed{3+\\sqrt{5}}$.",
    "To find the perimeter of the quadrilateral, we first need to find the points where the line $y = \\frac{x}{2}$ intersects the sides of the square. \n\nThe line intersects the square at the points where the $x$-coordinates of points on the square satisfy the equation $y = \\frac{x}{2}$. \n\nLet's first find the coordinates where the line intersects the two vertical sides of the square (x = a and x = -a). We plug in these x values into the equation y = x/2:\n\nFor x = a, we plug a into the equation to get y = a/2. This point is (a, a/2).\n\nFor x = -a, we plug -a into the equation to get y = -a/2. This point is (-a, -a/2).\n\nNow, we need to find where the line intersects the two horizontal sides of the square (y = a and y = -a). Since these lines are horizontal, their $y$-coordinates are $a$ and $-a$, respectively. We use the equation $y = \\frac{x}{2}$ to find the corresponding $x$-coordinates.\n\nFor y = a, we plug in a into the equation and solve for x to get x = 2a. However, this value does not correspond to the square's side where y = a. Instead, it is two times too large. Hence we must take the smaller corresponding x value from the line, which is at (-2a,-a is not intersected however, a/2 is). This value does correspond to the square's side where y = a. So the x value is -2a (negative as the corresponding intersection with the horizontal line at y = a occurs at the left side of the square). This point is (-2a, a).\n\nSimilarly, for y = -a, we plug in -a into the equation and solve for x to get x = -2a. The x value is -2a (negative as the corresponding intersection with the horizontal line at y = -a occurs at the right side of the square). This point is (-2a, -a).\n\nNow, we have the four points where the line intersects the square: (a, a/2), (-a, -a/2), (-2a, a), and (2a, -a). However we have wrong numbers so let\u2019s fix them. Since y = x/2 cuts the square in half, we can get an intersection point at y = 2a and from there get  x by plugging in 2a for y. So x = 4a from there we get the points (4a, 2a) is our new intersect, hence we are not considering the other points.\n\nFinally, we can find the perimeter of the quadrilateral by finding the lengths of the four sides. The line segment from (a, a/2) to (4a, 2a) is the diagonal of a rectangle with side lengths a/2 and 3a/2. \n\nThe length of the diagonal is:  $\\sqrt{(a-4a)^2+(a/2-2a)^2}$\n  $= \\sqrt{9a^2+(a/2)^2}$\n  $= \\sqrt{9a^2+a^2/4}$\n  $= \\sqrt{36a^2/4+(a^2/4)}$\n  $= \\sqrt{37a^2/4}$\n  $=\\frac{\\sqrt{181a^2}}{2}$\n\nThe length of the other three sides are a + a/2 = 3a/2, a + 3a/2 = 5a/2, and 2a + a/2 = 5a/2.\n\nThe perimeter of the quadrilateral is the sum of these lengths:\n\nP = $\\frac{3\\sqrt{181}}{2}a + \\frac{5a}{2} +\\frac{5a}{2}+\\frac{7a}{2}$ \n\nThus the total perimeter in terms of a is\n\n$P =  \\frac{3\\sqrt{181}}{2}a + 9a$\n\nNow we need to divide P by a to get the value we want. \n\n$\\frac{P}{a} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{181}+18}{2}$ \n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{9\\sqrt{181}+18}{2}}$",
    "To find the perimeter of one of the congruent quadrilaterals, we need to find the lengths of its sides. The line $y = x/2$ cuts the square into two congruent quadrilaterals. \n\nLet's first find the points where the line intersects the square. The bottom edge of the square has $y$-coordinate $-a$ and the top edge has $y$-coordinate $a$. The line intersects the right edge of the square at $(x_1, x_1/2)$ and the left edge at $(-x_2, -x_2/2)$. \n\nSince the point $(x_1, x_1/2)$ lies on the right edge of the square, it must have $x$-coordinate $a$. So we have $x_1 = a$, and we can find the $y$-coordinate $x_1/2 = a/2$.\n\nSimilarly, the point $(-x_2, -x_2/2)$ lies on the left edge of the square, so it has $x$-coordinate $-a$. Therefore, $x_2 = a$, and we can find the $y$-coordinate $-x_2/2 = -a/2$.\n\nHowever, since we have found that x_2 equals a, that conflicts with the traditionally perceived relationship where y  = x/2 and this intersects at our given square space of both left and the right hand vertical lines. The intersection point $(-a, a/2)$ on the left edge of the square satisfies both $y = a/2$ and $y = x/2$, so $x_2 = -a$ is indeed the point. This gives $(-a, -a/2)$ on the left edge as well as $(-a,a)$ point."
