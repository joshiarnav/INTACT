    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the lengths of the four edges on the base:**\nSince the base is a square with side length 10 cm, all edges on the base have a length of 10 cm.\n\n2. **Determine the length of each of the four slant edges:**\nWe'll use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the length of the slant edge. We'll denote the length of the slant edge as l. \n\nFrom the center of the base to a corner of the base, the distance is half of the diagonal of the base, and it can be found as follows:\nFirst find the diagonal of the base with d = side * sqrt(2), d = 10 * sqrt(2).\nThen the distance from the base center to a corner is half the diagonal, which is: distance = (10 * sqrt(2)) / 2 = 5 * sqrt(2).\n\nNext, apply the Pythagorean Theorem with the height of the pyramid (12 cm) and the distance from the base center to a corner (5 * sqrt(2)), and the hypotenuse being the slant edge length (l).\n\nLet's denote the unknown slant edge length as l. According to the Pythagorean Theorem, $${l^2} = 12^2 + (5\\sqrt{2})^2$$.\nThis is equivalent to: $${l^2} = 144 + 50$$ \nThen this becomes $${l^2} = 194$$, and the unknown length of l is the square root of 194. So l = sqrt(194).\n\n3. **Calculate the sum of all the edge lengths:**\nWe'll multiply the number of edges on the base by the length of each base edge (10 cm), then multiply the number of slant edges (4) by their lengths (square root of 194), and add the two totals together.\n\nSum = (4 * 10) + (4 * sqrt(194))\nSum = 40 + (4 * sqrt(194))\nSum \u2248 40 + (4 * 13.9284)\nSum \u2248 40 + 55.7136\nSum \u2248 95.7136\n\nThe sum of the lengths of the eight edges is approximately 95.71.",
    "To find the sum of the lengths of the pyramid's eight edges, we need to calculate the lengths of the four base edges and the four slant edges. \n\nFirst, we'll calculate the lengths of the base edges. Since the base is a square with side length 10 cm, the total length of the base edges is $4 \\times 10 = 40$ cm.\n\nNow, let's focus on the slant edges. We can imagine a right-angled triangle formed by the height of the pyramid (12 cm), half the diagonal of the base, and the slant edge. \n\nWe can find half the diagonal of the base by first calculating the full diagonal of the base.

    "To find the sum of the lengths of the pyramid's eight edges, we can break it down into parts. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the length of the edges on the base.

To do this, we'll first identify a right triangle in the pyramid. We can use a slant edge, the center of the base, and a point directly below the peak as the vertices of the right triangle.\n\nLet's call the distance from the center of the base to a corner of the base 'b'. Since it's a square base, the distance 'b' is half the diagonal of the base, or b = 10\\*sqrt(2)/2 = 5\\*sqrt(2) cm. \n\nNow, let's call the length of the slant edge 's'.
