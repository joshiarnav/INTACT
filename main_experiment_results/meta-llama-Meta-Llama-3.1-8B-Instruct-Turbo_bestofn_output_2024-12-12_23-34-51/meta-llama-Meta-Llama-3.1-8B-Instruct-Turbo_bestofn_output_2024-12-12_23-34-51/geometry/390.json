    "To begin solving the problem, let's break down the information provided: \n\n1. Given that $m \\angle A= 60^\\circ$, we can deduce that triangle $ABC$ is a scalene triangle with a $60^\\circ$ angle, but we still need to find angle $C$.\n\n2. The fact that $\\overline{BD} \\perp \\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{CE} \\perp \\overline{AB}$ tell us that triangles $BDC$ and $AEB$ are right-angled triangles.\n\n3. The relationship of $m \\angle DBC = 3m \\angle ECB$ gives us a relation between the angles.\n\nLet's denote $m \\angle ECB$ as $x$, so $m \\angle DBC = 3x$. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we can calculate the measure of angle $C$. In triangle $BCA$, angle $C$ is equal to $180^\\circ - (60^\\circ + x)$.\n\nWe also know that the sum of angles of triangle $BCD$ is $180^\\circ$. Angle $C$ also equals $180^\\circ - (3x + 90^\\circ)$ as it is an angle of the right-angled triangle $BCD$.\n\nSince $C = C$, we can write the equation as:\n\n$$180 - 60 - x = 180 - (3x+90).$$\n\nSolving the equation for $x$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n120 - x &= 90 - 3x\\\\\n-x+3x &=90-120\\\\\n2x &= -30\\\\\nx &= -15\\\\\nx &= 15\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe used the property of equality of two expressions to solve the equation, then discarded the negative solution.\n\nNow, we know that $m \\angle ECB = 15^\\circ$, and $m \\angle DBC = 3 \\cdot 15 = 45^\\circ$.\n\nLet's introduce some new variables: \n\n- Denote $EC = a$ and $DC = b$. In the same manner, $BC = 12$. As $EC \\perp AB$, we also know that $EC$ forms a right triangle with $AB$, i.e., triangle $AEB$ is a right triangle.\n\nSince $m \\angle ECB = 15^\\circ$, we can apply trigonometric ratios in triangle $AEB$. As it is a right triangle, we can calculate the length of segment $BE$ in terms of the length of segment $AB$ or the angle.\n\nGiven that $m \\angle A = 60^\\circ$, triangle $ABC$ is a scalene triangle.\n\nWe denote the circumradius of triangle $ABC$ as $R$, the radius of the inscribed circle of triangle $ABC$ as $r$, and denote the area of triangle $ABC$ as $K$.\n\nSince triangle $ABC$ is a scalene triangle with a $60^\\circ$ angle, the circumcenter $O$ of triangle $ABC$ coincides with the incenter of triangle $ABC$, and we can denote it as $O$.\n\nIn triangle $ABC$, we can write the formula of the circumference of the circumcircle as $C=2\\pi R$, where $C$ is the circumference of the circumcircle. The circumradius of triangle $ABC$ is also the distance between the circumcenter $O$ and any of the vertices of the triangle.\n\nIn the same manner, in triangle $AEO$, the radius of the inscribed circle of triangle $AEO$ is denoted $r$, and we can denote $EC=r\\sin\\angle A$.\n\nWe also have $m \\angle ECB = 15^\\circ$ and $m \\angle DBC = 45^\\circ$, which gives us $m\\angle BDC = 90^\\circ - 45^\\circ = 45^\\circ$. We also know that triangle $BCD$ is a right triangle.\n\nGiven that triangle $BCD$ is a right triangle with $BC = 12$ units, we can denote the length of the other leg of the triangle as $DC = 12\\cos45^\\circ = 12 \\cdot 2^{-\\frac12} = 6 \\cdot 2^{\\frac12}$ units.\n\nSimilarly, as triangle $BCD$ is a right triangle, we can denote $BD = 12\\sin\\angle DBC = 12\\sin45^\\circ = 6\\sqrt{2}$ units.\n\nTriangle $BCN$ is an isosceles triangle with $BN = NC$ and base $BC=12$, so the height $NH$ of the triangle is $NH=\\frac{12}{\\sqrt{2}}$. The height $BH$ of triangle $BCD$ is $BH=6\\sqrt{2}+6\\sqrt{2}=12\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTherefore, $CH=NH-BH= \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{2}}-12\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWe made the substitution of $NH=CH+\\frac{BH}{2}$ ...",
    "To begin with, since $m\\angle A = 60^\\circ$, we find that $m \\angle BAC= 120^\\circ$ as angle sum in a triangle is 180 and it is an exterior angle in $\\triangle BCD$. Therefore, in $\\triangle BCD$, we have that $m \\angle BDC = 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 120^\\circ= -30^\\circ$. Thus, triangle BCD is an isosceles right $-\\triangle ACD$.\n\nThus, in the problem, it gives us additional information that it's asking us to find x=BD. Since in a right triangle $BD=BC\\times \\cos{45^\\circ}$. Since $BC=12$, $BD= 12\\times\\cos{45^\\circ} = 6\\times\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow we need to find x=EC=BE x. To find this, we can make use of the angle x x= $\\angle ECB$ = m $\\angle ECB$ / 2 since it's an isosceles triangle due to properties of a right angle being equal in the triangle due to the angles properties.  It follows that: $$m \\angle ECB= \\frac{m\\angle ECB}{2}$$\nSince the angles add up to 180 we have $3\\frac{m \\angle ECB}{2}+ 2\\times\\frac{m \\angle ECB}{2} + 90 = 180 $, we arrive at: $$\\frac{m\\angle ECB}{2} = \\frac{45^\\circ}{3}$$. \nIt follows that: \n$\\angle ECB = 15^\\circ. It follows that $\\angle DCB = 75^\\circ$. Thus we have that x=BE. Since in a right triangle triangle BEC with  $\\angle BCE=75^\\circ$ is isosceles:  $$BE= EC \\times \\frac{\\sin{75^\\circ}}{\\sin{15^\\circ}}$$. Let us first find the sine of 75 and 15. We follow that:\n$$\\sin{75^\\circ} = \\cos(15^\\circ)$$\nUsing the half-angle identity for cosine and substituting the values of sine and cosine of 15 degrees we have:\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\sin 75^\\circ &= \\cos 15^\\circ\\\\\n    &= \\cos \\left( \\frac 12 (30) \\right)\\\\\n    &= \\cos \\left( \\frac 12 \\left( (30^\\circ) \\right) \\right)\\\\\n    &= \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\cos 30^\\circ}{2}}\n\\end{align*}\nSince the value of cosine of 30 is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, we find:\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\cos 30^\\circ &= \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, we have:\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\sin 75^\\circ &= \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\cos 30^\\circ}{2}}\\\\\n    &= \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2}}\\\\\n    &=\\sqrt{\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{3}}{4}}\\\\\n    &= \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+3}{\\sqrt{3}^2}}\\\\\n    &= \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+3}{3}}\n\\end{align*}",
