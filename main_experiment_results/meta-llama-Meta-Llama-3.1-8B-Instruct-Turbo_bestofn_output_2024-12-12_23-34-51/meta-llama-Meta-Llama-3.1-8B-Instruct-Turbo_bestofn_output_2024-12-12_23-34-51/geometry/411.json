    "To solve this problem, we can use the properties of similar triangles. The key observation here is that triangles $\\bigtriangleup AEB$ and $\\bigtriangleup FDC$ are similar. This is because they both share the same angle at point $E$ (or $F$), and the right angles at points $B$ and $F$, $D$ and $C$. Because of this similarity, the ratio of their side lengths will be equal.\n\nSince $AB = 28$ units and $CD = 58$ units, we can set up the following proportion based on the corresponding side lengths of these two similar triangles:\n\n$$\\frac{AB}{x} = \\frac{x}{CD}$$\n\nHere, $x$ is the side length of the square $BCFE$. To find the side length of the square, we can cross-multiply and solve for $x$:\n\n$$\\frac{28x}{x} = \\frac{x}{58}$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow 28 \\cdot 58 = x^2$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow x^2 = 1624$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow x = \\sqrt{1624}$$\n\nThe side length of the square $BCFE$ is $\\sqrt{1624}$. To find the area of the square, we take the square of this length:\n\nArea $= x^2$\n$= \\sqrt{1624}^2$\n$= 1624$\n\nTherefore, the area of the square $BCFE$ is 1624 square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1624}$",
