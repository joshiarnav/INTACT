    "To find $\\cos \\angle AMB$, we need to consider the properties of the regular tetrahedron.\n\n1. **Understanding a regular tetrahedron**: A regular tetrahedron is a right triangular pyramid where all four faces are equilateral triangles.\n\n2. **M is the midpoint of CD**: Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{CD}$, the line segment $\\overline{CM}$ is equal to the line segment $\\overline{MD}$.\n\n3. **Pointing lines from points A and B to M and C or D**: We can point lines from $A$ to $C$ and $D$, and lines from $B$ to $C$ and $D$, each touching at the corners of the tetrahedron faces to connect quadrilateral $ACMD$ creating a 3-simplex shape. Due to symmetry, line segments $AC$ and $BD$ are the same length and so are line segments $AD$ and $BC$. All of these line segments are \u201cedges\u201d of the 3-simplex shape.\n\n4. **Tetrahedron center height lines 2. Height of the tetrahedron is found by finding the point at which line $AB$ and line $AC$ meet at the center of tetrahedron $ABCD$. Then draw a perpendicular line from the point to $AB$, and the length of that line segment is $h$. The fact that line $ABCD$ and the three height lines have all the same slope 1 enables us to directly obtain this calculation and this conceptual clarity in terms of a regular tetrahedron. The following U-pentagon is also helpful to visualize from quadrilateral \u201cDABC\u201d by fold lines and segment U parts at \u201cD\u201d point for A1 B1 C1 to B2 C2, quadrilateral $DABC$ helps make useful height lines 2. Height of the tetrahedron is found by finding the point $H$ at which line $AB$ and line $AC$ meet at the center of tetrahedron $ABCD$ using regular geometric shapes and not a 3-D conceptual clarity in terms of a regular tetrahedron.\n\n5. **6-simplex calculation and not a 3-D conceptual clarity in terms of a regular tetrahedron.**: To find the segment length U of quadrilateral \u201cDDC\u201d we now have quadrilateral \u201cDABC\u201d in terms of fold lines and segment U U parts at \u201cD\u201d point, now the conceptual clarity in terms of regular tetrahedron\u2019s downward fold segment line U parts at \u201cD\u201d point for A1 B1 C1 to \u201cDABC\u201d by fold lines and segment U parts of equilateral triangle \u201cDABC\u201d would appear to create pentagon \u201cDABC\u201d.
