    "To find $AB$, we need to find the area of the equilateral triangle using the information provided about the perpendiculars.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the equilateral triangle as 's'. \n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{s^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n\nNow, we'll find the area of equilateral $\\triangle ABC$ using the information about perpendiculars.\n\nSince $PQ = 1$, $PR = 2$, and $PS = 3$, the area of $\\triangle APB$ is $\\frac{1 \\times s}{2}$, the area of $\\triangle BPC$ is $\\frac{2 \\times s}{2}$, and the area of $\\triangle CPA$ is $\\frac{3 \\times s}{2}$.\n\nThe sum of these three areas is equal to the area of the equilateral $\\triangle ABC$ because point $P$ is inside $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nTherefore, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{s}{2} \\times (1+2+3) = 3s$, which is also equal to $\\frac{s^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n\nNow, equating the two expressions, we get:\n\n$\\frac{s^2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = 3s$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4 and dividing both sides by $s$, we get:\n\n$s\\sqrt{3} = 12$\n\nDividing both sides by $\\sqrt{3}$, we get:\n\n$s = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nNow, we'll rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{3}$. \n\nSo we get,\n\n$s = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{12\\sqrt{3}}{3}$\n\nTherefore, $s = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$.",

    "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of area and the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the equilateral triangle as $s$. We can divide the equilateral triangle into three right-angled triangles: APQ, BPR, and CSP. The height of each of these triangles is the perpendicular distance from point P to the respective side of the equilateral triangle.\n\nThe area of each of these right-angled triangles can be expressed as (base * height) / 2. \n\nThe area of triangle APQ is (1 * s * sin(60\u00b0)) / 2.\nThe area of triangle BPR is (2 * s * sin(60\u00b0)) / 2.\nThe area of triangle CSP is (3 * s * sin(60\u00b0)) / 2.\n\nThe area of the equilateral triangle ABC can be expressed as (s * s * sqrt(3)) / 4. \n\nSince the three right-angled triangles together form the equilateral triangle, we can equate the sum of their areas to the area of the equilateral triangle:\n\n(1 * s * sin(60\u00b0)) / 2 + (2 * s * sin(60\u00b0)) / 2 + (3 * s * sin(60\u00b0)) / 2 = (s * s * sqrt(3)) / 4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(6 * s * sin(60\u00b0)) / 2 = (s * s * sqrt(3)) / 4\n\nNow, substitute the value of sin(60\u00b0) = sqrt(3) / 2:\n\n(6 * s * (sqrt(3) / 2)) / 2 = (s * s * sqrt(3)) / 4\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n12 * s * sqrt(3) = s * s * sqrt(3)\n\nNow, divide by sqrt(3):\n\n12s = s^2\n\nSubtract s^2 from both sides:\n\ns^2 - 12s = 0\n\nFactor out s:\n\ns(s - 12) = 0\n\nSo either s = 0 or s - 12 = 0.
