    "To find the volume of the given solid, we first need to visualize it. The upper edge is parallel to the base and has length $2s$, which forms a square, and the other edges, with length $s$, form isosceles triangles on each side. \n\nNext, let's consider a cross-section of the solid parallel to the base. It will be a trapezoid, $\\overline{ED} \\parallel \\overline{BF}$.\n\nNow, let's focus on finding the area of one of the triangular faces of the tetrahedron, and then use the other isosceles triangle on the other side of the solid as well, realizing the two triangular faces would actually have a shared base and will represent only half of the square that has length $2s$. Therefore $\\triangle AED$ represents half of the tetrahedron with volume $(s^2) * (h/2) = (6\\sqrt2)^2 * (s/2)$ where s/2 equals the triangle height, that will be $\\sqrt{(s/sqrt(2))^2 - (s/2)^2}$ which can be easily reduced into $s\\sqrt2/2 - s/2$ = $s/2 * (\\sqrt2 - 1)$. In order to get the full volume we will, therefore multiply this formula by $2s * \\sqrt2 *2$ = $4\\sqrt2$, giving the volume of the actual tetrahedron $\\boxed{4\\sqrt2 * s^2 * (\\sqrt2 - 1)/2}$ = $2\\sqrt2 * s^2 * (\\sqrt2 - 1)$\n\nNow we plug in $s = 6\\sqrt2$ which we have at the beginning of the problem:\n\n$2\\sqrt2 * s^2 * (\\sqrt2 - 1)$ = $2\\sqrt2 * (6\\sqrt2)^2 * (\\sqrt2 - 1)$ = $2\\sqrt2 * 72 * (\\sqrt2 - 1)$ = $144 * (2 - \\sqrt2)$ = $144 * (2 - 1.414) = 144 * 0.586 = 84.4146$\n\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number this gives,  $\\boxed{84}$",
    "Step 1:  First, we are given a solid with a square base of side length $s$. The upper edge is parallel to the base, with a length of $2s$. In addition, we are informed that all other edges have a length of $s$.\nStep 2:  To find the volume of the solid, we need to understand the structure and interpret the given information correctly. The triangle $EAD$ and $ADB$ are right triangles, and because these triangles are congruent, we can conclude that the lengths of $ED$ and $AD$ are $ED=s/2$ and $DA=s$.\n\nStep 3:  We can deduce that the solid consists of a square pyramid with base $ABCD$ and a height of $s$. Furthermore, we need to find the height of the other square pyramid with base $ADCF$ above the first pyramid.\n\nStep 4:  We observe that there are two ways to construct a square pyramid with height $s$: one is to start with triangle $ACF$, height $s$, and a base with side length $AC = s$. The other way is to start with triangle $ABC$, height $\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}$, and a base $AB$ with side length $\\frac{s}{2}$\n\nStep 5:  An alternate method to determine the volume is by interpretating the figure, $2$ pyramids $ABDE$ and $BCFD$  with a height of $6$ and a base area of $\\frac{s^2}{2}$. \n\nStep 6:  We know that the base of the pyramid has a side length of $s$ and we have the value of $s$ as $6\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nStep 7:  To find the area of the base, we need to calculate $s^2$ and divide it by $2$. The height of the pyramids is given by the value of $s$ as $6\\sqrt{2}$ since it is the length of the other edges of the solid.\n\nStep 8:  The height of the pyramids is given by the value of $s$ as $6$. In calculating $s^2$, we obtain $(6\\sqrt{2})^2$, which gives $72$. Dividing by $2$, we get $36$ as the area of the base.\n\nStep 9:  Using the formula for the volume of a pyramid, which is $\\frac{1}{3} * \\text{Base Area} * \\text{Height}$, we can substitute the known values into the formula.\n\nStep 10:  The volume of the pyramids $ABDE$ and $BCFD$ can be calculated by $\\frac{1}{3} * 36 * 6$, giving us $72$. The volume of the solid is the sum of the volumes of these two pyramids, so $72 + 72 = \\boxed{144}$.\n\nStep 11:  An alternate method uses triangle $\\triangle ABC$ with a height of $6$ and a base area of $\\frac{s^2}{2}$. We will end up with the same solution.\n\nStep 12:  We have triangle $\\triangle ABC $ triangle $\\triangle FCA$, but since we have height $6$ and  triangle $\\triangle CFA$ has a base of $\\frac{s^2}{2}$,\n\nStep 13:  The area of triangle $\\triangle ABC$  area of $s^2/2$,  triangle $\\triangle CFA$, since $ triangle \\triangle ABC $ has the same base as $s^2/2$ but the height is 6  Height is $\\frac{s^2}{2}$.\n\nStep 14:  The volume of a solid is $2 * 72$, so it is $144$.\n\nStep 15:  To get the volume of solid area $s^2$, we replace $s^2$ with $(6\\sqrt2)^2$,  and get $(6\\sqrt2)^2 *_2  * \\frac{1}{3}  *_6$ \n\nThe volume of the solid is $144$ cubic units.",
    "To find the volume of the given solid, we need to break it down into simpler shapes and then calculate their volumes. \n\nStep 1:  The given solid consists of two triangular prisms. We'll calculate the volume of one part (ABCED) and then double it to get the total volume.\n\nStep 2:  The base of the prism is a square with side length $s$. The upper edge (CDE) has a length of $s$, and edges CD and DE have lengths of $s$. \n\nStep 3:  To calculate the volume of the prism (ABCED), we'll first find the area of the base (ABCD) as a square with side length $s$. The area of the base is given by $s^2 = (6\\sqrt{2})^2 = 72$.\n\nStep 4:  Next, we'll calculate the height of the prism. We can do this by dropping a perpendicular from E to the plane ABCD. Let the foot of the perpendicular be G. Note that DG is half the length of CD, which is $s$. So, DG = $s/2$ = $3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nStep 5:  The height of the prism is the distance between E and the plane ABCD, which is the length of the line EG. To find this, we drop a perpendicular from E to the base CD. Let H be the foot of this perpendicular on CD. Since the line EH is perpendicular to CD, the triangles AHD and EHC are right triangles.\n\nStep 6:  Using the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle EHC, we get that EH = $\\sqrt{(s/2)^2+(s/2)^2}$ = $\\sqrt{2 \\cdot (s/2)^2}$ = $\\sqrt{(s^2/2)}$ = $\\sqrt{(72/2)}$ = $\\sqrt{36}$ = $6$.\n\nStep 7:  Therefore, the height of the prism is $6$, which is the length of EG.\n\nStep 8:  Now, we'll calculate the volume of the prism (ABCED) which is given by the product of the base area and the height. So, the volume of ABCED = base area * height = 72 * 6 = 432.\n\nStep 9:  Since the given solid consists of two such prisms (ABCED and ABFCD), the total volume is given by twice the volume of (ABCED). Hence, the volume of the solid = 2 * 432 = $\\boxed{864}$"
