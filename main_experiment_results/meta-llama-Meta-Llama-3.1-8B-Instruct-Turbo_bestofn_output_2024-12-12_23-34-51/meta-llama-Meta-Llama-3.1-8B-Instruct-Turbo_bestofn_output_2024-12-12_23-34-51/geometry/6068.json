    "To find the length of the light path, we will first determine the coordinates of point P, then calculate the distance traveled until it hits the cube's vertex. \n\nSince the coordinates of A are (12,0,0) and the light beam reflects off the cube at point P and then continues on, let the coordinates of P be (x,y,z).\n\nWe can use the distance formula to relate the coordinates of P and its position relative to the cube.\n\nWe are given the distance from P to B, G and C as follows:\n- PB = sqrt(x^2 + 12^2)\n- PG = sqrt(x^2 + (12)^2 + y^2)\n- PC = sqrt((x-12)^2 + y^2 + z^2)\n\nHowever, we are given the distances of P from BG and BC as 7 and 5 units.\n\nTherefore, \n1) (x^2 + 12^2) = (7^2 + (12-a)^2) \n   x^2 = 49 + a^2 - 2*a*12 + 144 \n   x^2 = 193 - 24 *a  \n2) x^2 + (12)^2 + y^2 = (5^2 + (12-a)^2 + b^2) \n   x^2 + 144 + y^2 = 25 + (144-a^2) + b^2 \n   x^2 + y^2 + a^2 = 169 + b^2\n\nSubstituting equation 1 in equation 2 we get,\n   193 - 24a + y^2 + a^2 = 169 + b^2  \n   y^2 = 24a + b^2 - 24",
    "To find the length of the light path from the time it leaves point $A$ until it next reaches a vertex of the cube, we can visualize the light beam as a line segment that reflects off the faces of the cube at point $P$ and then continues to the nearest vertex.\n\nFirst, we can translate the cube so that vertex $A$ is at the origin. Then, the coordinates of the vertices of the cube are integers with all being multiples of 12 (except for vertex $A$). This transformation also applies to the points on face $BCFG$.\n\n\nGiven the coordinates of the vertices of the cube, we can infer the coordinates of point $P$. Since $P$ lies on face $BCFG$ and $P$ is 7 units from $\\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\\overline{BC}$, we can consider $P$ as the intersection of the line $5x+12y+36=0$ and the plane containing face $BCGF$.\n\n\nWe can capture a reflection in the cube by establishing a right triangle of the segment of the path of the light, then use Pythagoras' theorem to determine the length of the hypotenuse (the segment of the path of the light), the edges forming the right triangle being parallel to the edges of the cube. The reflection includes a turning of the light, as it goes from an edge that is vertical in the right triangle to an edge that is horizontal. In other words the segment making the angle between vertical and horizontal reflects off from the hypotenuse of the right triangle of light. One way to model light reflection off of a cube, first model light reflection off of a cube containing the first reflection of the light off of the cube, then model the reflection of the edges of the right triangle of light after the reflection of the light off of the cube first model the cube containing first reflection. Then the segment of the hypotenuse of the right triangle of the light (that reflects at point P) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle that is within a larger cube in which this cube first models the edges of the right triangle of the first model of the light, containing all the first step reflections of the light and also contains this cube containing the first reflection of the light. Then find the length of hypotenuse the of light containing all first step model light reflections, containing first step of the reflection and also the \"short\" second model of the light containing second reflection in the second model of the reflection off the of the larger cube. Then the length of the hypotenuse of the larger first cube containing the first reflection is 21\\sqrt2, since there is no rotation from vertical to horizontal reflection in the second model of the light, only horizontal to vertical reflection in the second model of the light, and the light containing all first step model light reflections is within first cube containing the first reflection and the short second cube \"contains\" all the \"short\" first model light reflection in the larger cube and the length of the hypotenuse of the short second model of the light is 12\\sqrt2, and light \"short containing first step model of the light\" \"contains\" this \"short cube\", this first cube contains the first reflection and the second cube \"contains\" the second reflection in the larger cube. The length of the hypotenuse in the larger cube first containing the first reflection is 21\\sqrt{2}, the length of the hypotenuse in the \"short\" second cube is 12\\sqrt{2}.

    "To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.\n\nStep 1:  Visualize the cube and understand the path of the light beam. We are given a cube with $AB=12$, and the light beam emanates from vertex $A$ and reflects off face $BCFG$ at point $P$, which is 7 units from $\\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\\overline{BC}$.\n\nStep 2:  We can break down the path of the light beam into several segments. The first segment is when the light beam travels from $A$ to $P$ on the face $BCFG$. We can calculate the distance of this segment using the Pythagorean theorem because we have the lengths of the two sides formed by the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of point $P$. Since point $P$ is 7 units from $\\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\\overline{BC}$, we can visualize it as a point on a rectangle with side lengths 7 and 5. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find that the length of the first segment is $5\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nStep 3:  The light then travels to vertex $C$ on face $ABCD$. This forms a straight line segment and the distance is simply the length of one of the edges of the cube, which is 12.\n\nStep 4:  Next, the light beam reflects off face $CDEF$ and travels to point $Q$ which is 5 units from $\\overline{CD}$ and 7 units from $\\overline{CF$. Then it travels from $Q$ to vertex $B$ on face $BFGC$. The distance traveled between point $Q$ to point $B$ is the same in both the $x$ and $y$ directions and therefore would have the same distance of  $12\\sqrt{2}$, but is not our end point so is irrelevant to our solution, as we are only interested in the next vertex hit.\n\nStep 5:  The light is now inside cube  $ABCD$ which we can now label $CDEF$ and travels to vertex $D$, the point which we are trying to reach is $\\boxed{12\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\n\n\nStep 6:  The total distance traveled by the light beam is the sum of the distances traveled in each of the straight segments, i.e., it is $5\\sqrt{2} + 12 +12 \\sqrt{2}$, but this is not our answer it is simply the distance traveled until we reach our end point. The end point that is the point of vertex  $D$.\n\n\n\nStep 7:  We can find the distance $ AD$ in a 3d space(isometric frame  in 3d) as it is  $\\sqrt{18^2+ 18^2}=6\\sqrt{19}$ where $AD$ is  the hypotenuse  and the point of origin is(isometric). And as $AD= 6\\sqrt{19}$ is our value for our variable is $\\boxed{m\\sqrt{n}}$.\n\n\n\nStep 8:  Calculating $m$ and $n$  where $m$ is 6 and $n$ is 19 which we know(is resolved). We can  simply add the values of $m$ and $n$ which would be 6+19=25.\n\n\n\nStep 9:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{25}$."

  "solution": "When a light beam reflects off a surface, the path is like that of a ball bouncing. Picture that, and also imagine X, Y, and Z coordinates for the cube vertices. The coordinates will all involve 0's and 12's only, so that means that the X, Y, and Z distance traveled by the light must all be divisible by 12. Since the light's Y changes by 5 and the X changes by 7 (the Z changes by 12, don't worry about that), and 5 and 7 are relatively prime to 12, the light must make 12 reflections onto the XY plane or the face parallel to the XY plane.\nIn each reflection, the distance traveled by the light is $\\sqrt{ (12^2) + (5^2) + (7^2) }$ = $\\sqrt{218}$. This happens 12 times, so the total distance is $12\\sqrt{218}$. $m=12$ and $n=218$, so therefore, the answer is $m+n=\\boxed{230}$.",
