    "To find the value of $m$, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. We are given that the product of the radii is $68$, and we need to find a relationship between the radii of $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$. Let's call the radii of $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ as $r_1$ and $r_2$, respectively. Since their product is $68$, we can write $r_1 \\cdot r_2 = 68$.\n\n2. The point of intersection of the circles is $(9,6)$. Let's draw a diagram to visualize the situation.\n\n3. The x-axis and the line $y = mx$ are tangent to both circles. Let's find the equations of the tangent lines. The equation of the x-axis is $y = 0$, and the equation of the line $y = mx$ is $y = mx$.\n\n4. The tangent lines intersect the circles at two points each. Let's call the point of intersection of the x-axis and $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ as $(x_1, 0)$ and the point of intersection of the line $y = mx$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ as $(x_2, mx_2)$.\n\n5. We can find the equations of the tangent lines to the circles. The equation of the tangent line to $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ is $y = \\frac{r_1}{x_1 - 9} (x - 9)$, and the equation of the tangent line to $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ is $y = \\frac{r_2}{x - 9} (x - 9) + 6$.\n\n6. The tangent line $y = mx$ should be tangent to both circles, so we can set the equations from step 5 equal to each other: $\\frac{r_1}{x_1 - 9} (x - 9) = mx$ and $\\frac{r_2}{x - 9} (x - 9) + 6 = mx$.\n\n7. Solving these equations for $x$, we get two values: $x_1$ and $x_2$. We can then substitute these values back into the equations to find the corresponding $y$ values.\n\n8. However, instead of solving these equations directly, let's consider the fact that the radii are related to the distance from the point of intersection $(9,6)$ to the center of the circles. Let's call the distance from the center of $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ to the point $(9,6)$ as $r_1$ and the distance from the center of $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ to the point $(9,6)$ as $r_2$.\n\n9. The centers of the circles are on the line $y = mx$, so they have the form $(x, mx)$. The distance from the center of $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ to the point $(9,6)$ is the square root of $(x - 9)^2 + (mx - 6)^2$, and this distance is equal to $r_1$. Similarly, the distance from the center of $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ to the point $(9,6)$ is the square root of $(x - 9)^2 + (mx - 6)^2$, and this distance is equal to $r_2$.\n\n10. We can write the equation $r_1 \\cdot r_2 = 68$ in terms of these distances.\n\n11. Simplifying the equation, we get $(x - 9)^2 + (mx - 6)^2 = \\frac{220}{(x - 9)^2}$.\n\n12. Expanding and simplifying, we get the equation $m^2 x^2 + (-2m^2  + 2m - 18)x + 1 = 0$. We can substitute $x = 9$ into this equation to find the corresponding value of $m$, since the point $(9,6)$ is on both circles. Solving the equation for $m$, we get $m = \\frac{12\\sqrt{221}}{49}$.\n\n13. Finally, the value of $m$ can be written in the form $a\\sqrt{b}/c$, where $a = 12$, $b = 221$, and $c = 49$. Therefore, the sum $a + b + c = 12 + 221 + 49 = 282$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{282}$",
    "To solve this problem, we start by understanding the properties of the circles and the given conditions. \n\nLet the center of $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ be denoted as $C_1 = (a_1, 0)$ and the center of $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ be denoted as $C_2 = (a_2, a_2m)$. Note that the y-coordinate of $C_2$ is not zero since $m > 0$. \n\nWe know that one of the intersection points of the two circles is $(9,6)$. Using the equation of a circle, we can express this in two ways:\n\n(1) from $\\mathcal{C_1}$: $(x - a_1)^2 + y^2 = a_1^2$\n\n(2) from $\\mathcal{C_2}$: $(x - a_2)^2 + (y - a_2m)^2 = a_2^2$\n\nUsing the first equation, and given that the point $(9,6)$ is on the circle, we can write:\n\n$(9 - a_1)^2 + 6^2 = a_1^2$\n\nExpanding this equation gives us:\n\n$81 - 18a_1 + a_1^2 + 36 = a_1^2$\n\nCombine like terms to get:\n\n$117 - 18a_1 = 0$\n\nThen solve for $a_1$, to get:\n\n$18a_1 = 117$\n\n$a_1 = 117/18$\n\n$a_1 = 39/6$\n\n$a_1 = 13$\n\nSimilarly, using the second equation and the point $(9,6)$ being on the circle, we get:\n\n$(9 - a_2)^2 + (6 - a_2m)^2 = a_2^2$\n\nExpand this equation to get:\n\n$81 -18a_2 + a_2^2 + 36 -12a_2m + a_2^2m^2 = a_2^2$\n\nCombine like terms, and note that $a_2^2$ cancels out, resulting in:\n\n$117 - 18a_2 -12a_2m + a_2^2m^2 = 0$\n\nWe are given that the product of the radii is 68. Recall that the radius $r_1$ of $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ is $r_1 = a_1$ and the radius $r_2$ of $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ is $r_2 = a_2$. Then we get that:\n\n$r_1 \\times r_2 = 68$\n\nUsing the fact that $a_1 = 13$, we can substitute to get:\n\n$13 \\times a_2 = 68$\n\nThen, solve for $a_2$ to get:\n\n$a_2 = 68/13$\n\n$a_2 = 4 \\times 13/13$\n\n$a_2 = 4$\n\nWith the value of $a_2$ known to be 4, we now proceed to find the slope m of the given line. Recall the equation of the line given in the problem is $y = mx$. Note that the x and y axes are not parallel to the given line. The given line is oblique, and it should also be tangent to both circles. Let the point of tangency on the x-axis be $P$. Since it is tangent to $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$, and the center of $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ is at $C_2 = (a_2, a_2m)$, the center of $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$, point $P$, and point $(0,0)$ should not be collinear. \nHence, point $P$ cannot be the center of $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$. \nPoint $P$ is the point where the given line is tangent to circle $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and the circle whose equation is $x = 0$. \nThe coordinates of point $P$ are $(13, 0)$ or $(-13, 0)$, since $P$ must be at a distance of 13 units from the center of the circle $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$. \nSince the given line should be tangent to circle $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ as well, the given line should also not be tangent to the circle whose equation is $x = a_2$. \nRecall that the center of $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ is at $C_2 = (a_2, a_2m)$. Hence, we can eliminate the case when point $P$ is at the coordinates $(-13, 0)$ as it will not make the given line tangent to the circle whose equation is $x = 4$. \nWith point $P = (13, 0)$, we can substitute these values into the equation of the given line to get:\n\n$0 = 13m$\n\nEliminate m by taking the reciprocal, getting $m = \\frac{1}{13}$ \nSubstituting value for $a_2 = 4$ in $C_2 = (a_2, a_2m)$, we can write the value of $m$ as $m = (13.4)/4$ \nSimplify to get:\n\n$m = (13 \\times 4 + 13 + 4) / (4 \\times 4)$\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n$13 \\times 4 + 13 + 4 = 52 + 13 + 4$\n\n$52 + 13 + 4 = 69$\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n$4 \\times 4 = 16$\n\nWith the numerator and denominator simplified, we can rewrite the value of m to get:\n\n$m = 69 / 16$\n\nNote that the numerator and denominator are integers, and hence, they should be reduced.

    "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem\nTwo circles $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ intersect at two points, one of which is $(9,6)$. The product of the radii is $68$. The x-axis and the line $y = mx$ are tangent to both circles, where $m > 0$. We are asked to find the value of $m$ and then find $a + b + c$.\n\nStep 2: Draw and label points\nLet's draw a diagram of the situation. We denote the centers of $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ as $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ respectively, and their intersection points as $P$ and $Q$. The point of tangency between the line and $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ is denoted as $R$, and the point of tangency on the x-axis is denoted as $S$. \n\nConsider line $O_{1}P$ and the midpoint of segment $O_{1}P$ will lie on the line $y = mx$ denoted as $(a,a)$ where a = $\\frac{m}{m + 1} * 9$.\n\n\nStep 3: Find the center coordinates\nWe denoted the center of circle $C_{1}$ as $O_{1}$. Let's call the center coordinate $O_{1}$ as $(p, q)$. Since the line $y = mx$ is tangent to both circles and $m$ is positive, the line is always above the point $O_{1}$. The line $O_{1}P$ and the points $(a, a)$ lie on the line $y = mx$.\n\nStep 4: Find the equation of circle $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$\nThe general equation of a circle with center $(h, k)$ and radius $r$ is $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$. For our circle $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$, we have $(x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2 = r^2$.\n\nThe point $(9, 6)$ lies on the circle $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$. So we substitute these values into the equation of the circle and we get: $(9 - p)^2 + (6 - q)^2 = r^2$.\n\nStep 5: Solve for $p$ and $q$\nNow we are given that $r^{2} = 68$ because the product of the radii is $68$. We now have $(9 - p)^2 + (6 - q)^2 = 68$.\n\nTo find the center coordinates $(p, q)$, we can simplify and solve the equations we have.\n\nWe know from last step, $r = \\sqrt{68}$ is a factor of $(\\sqrt{y} - 6)^2 + (\\sqrt{x} - 10)^2 = 68$. And that we also have $(y, x)$ lies on the line $y = mx$. Thus, $(y,q) = (mx, mx)$ for this case.\n\nThe general equation of a line with slope $m$ and passing through point $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ is $y - {y_{1}}= m(x - {x_{1}})$.\n\nNow let's find the equation of the line passing through $(y, q)$ and is tangents to the circle $(\\sqrt{y} - 6)^2 + (\\sqrt{x} - 10)^2 = 68$. \n\nConsider line $O_{1}P$ and the point $(\\sqrt{y}, \\sqrt{x})$. The slope of the line $O_{1}P$ is $\\frac{9 - \\sqrt{y}}{6 - \\sqrt{x}}$.\n\nStep 6: Find the slope of the tangent line and solve\nSince line $(\\sqrt{y} - 6)^2 + (\\sqrt{x} - 10)^2 = 68$ is tangent to the circle $(\\sqrt{x} - q)^2 + (\\sqrt{y} - p)^2 = (\\sqrt{x} - 10)^2 + (\\sqrt{y} - 6)^2$, the slope is $\\frac{m}{m + 1}$.\n\nTherefore, we equate and solve for $\\sqrt{y}$ or $\\sqrt{x}$:\n\n$$\\frac{9 - \\sqrt{y}}{6 - \\sqrt{x}}= \\frac{m}{m + 1}$$\n\nWe denoted the center of circle $C_{1}$ as $O_{1}$. Let's call the center coordinate $O_{1}$ as $(p, q)$. Consider line $O_{1}P$ and the midpoint of segment $O_{1}P$ will lie on the line $y = mx$ denoted as $(a,a)$ where a = $\\frac{m}{m + 1} * 9$.\n\n$$\\frac{9 - \\sqrt{y}}{6 - \\sqrt{x}} = \\frac{m}{m + 1}$$\n\nMultiply both sides by $(9 - \\sqrt{y})(6 - \\sqrt{x})$. Then we get\n\n$$\\frac{m + 1}{m} \\left( {9 - \\sqrt{y}}\\right)\\left( {6 - \\sqrt{x}} \\right) = \\left( {9 - \\sqrt{y}} \\right)^2 + \\left( {6 - \\sqrt{x}} \\right)^2$$\n\n$$m + 1 = \\frac{\\left( {9 - \\sqrt{y}} \\right)^2 + \\left( {6 - \\sqrt{x}} \\right)^2}{\\frac{m}{m + 1}\\left( {9 - \\sqrt{y}} \\right)\\left( {6 - \\sqrt{x}} \\right)}$$\n\n$$\\left( {9 - \\sqrt{y}} \\right)\\left( {6 - \\sqrt{x}} \\right) = \\frac{\\left( {m + 1} \\right)^2}{m}\\left( {\\left( {9 - \\sqrt{y}} \\right)^2 + \\left( {6 - \\sqrt{x}} \\right)^2} \\right)$$\n\n$$(9 - \\sqrt{y}) (6 - \\sqrt{x}) = q(p - \\sqrt{y})$$\n\nStep 7: Solve for $\\sqrt{y}$ or $\\sqrt{x}$\nSince $(\\sqrt{y} - 6)^2 + (\\sqrt{x} - 10)^2 = 68$,\n\n$$(9 - \\sqrt{y}) (6 - \\sqrt{x}) = (\\sqrt{y} - 10)(\\sqrt{x} - 6)$$\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{m}{m + 1} * 9 = 9 - q$ and $6 - \\frac{m}{m + 1} * 9 = 10 - q$.\n\nSolving this system of equations\n\n$6 - 9 + q = \\frac{-9m + 9}{m + 1}$\n\nand $10 + 9 - q = \\frac{10m + 10}{m + 1}$\n\nNow we have $9m + 9 = (m + 1)(-9 + 10 + q)$ and $10m + 10 = (m + 1)(9 + 10 - q)$.\n\nFrom here\n\n\\begin{align*} \n9m + 9 & = -m + 1 + 10m - 9 + mq \\\\\n10m + 10 & = m + 1 + 19 - 10m - 10 + mq \n\\end{align*}\n\nSimplifying and solving, we get\n\n$$10m + 9 = mq$$\n$$-m + 9 = mq$$\n\n$$9m = -mq$$\n$$-m + mq = 9$$\n\n$$m(-q - 9) = q(-q - 9)$$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$m = \\frac{q(-q - 9)}{(-q - 9)}$$\n\nSimplifying\n\n$$m = q$$\n\nNow\n\n$$\\left( \\frac{qm + 9}{q} \\right)^2 + \\left( 9 - m \\right)^2 = 68$$\n\nExpand and simplify and you get:\n\n$$m^2 + 18m + 81 = 68$$\n\n$$m^2 + 18m + 13 = 0$$\n\nSolving for $m$, you get:\n\n$$m = \\frac{-18 \\pm \\sqrt{18^2 - 4 \\cdot 13}}{2}$$\n\n$$m = \\frac{-18 \\pm 10\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$m = -9 + 5\\sqrt{3}$$\n\nThe answer for $m$ is: \n$$\\boxed{-9 + 5\\sqrt{3}}$$\nThe number that we are looking for is: $-9 + 5\\sqrt{3}$\nTo solve this problem, we just had to use equations and do some basic algebra."

These two circles are tangent to the $x$-axis, so the radii of the circles are $a$ and $b$ respectively. We know that the point $(9,6)$ is a point on both circles, so we have that\n\\[(9-\\frac{a}{m_1})^2+(6-a)^2=a^2\\]\n\\[(9-\\frac{b}{m_1})^2+(6-b)^2=b^2\\]\nExpanding these and manipulating terms gives\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}a^2-[(18/m_1)+12]a+117=0\\]\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}b^2-[(18/m_1)+12]b+117=0\\]\nIt follows that $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the quadratic\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}x^2-[(18/m_1)+12]x+117=0\\]\nIt follows from Vieta's Formulas that the product of the roots of this quadratic is $117m_1^2$, but we were also given that the product of the radii was 68. Therefore $68=117m_1^2$, or $m_1^2=\\frac{68}{117}$. Note that the half-angle formula for tangents is\n\\[\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\cos{\\theta}}{1+\\cos{\\theta}}}\\]\nTherefore\n\\[\\frac{68}{117}=\\frac{1-\\cos{\\theta}}{1+\\cos{\\theta}}\\]\nSolving for $\\cos{\\theta}$ gives that $\\cos{\\theta}=\\frac{49}{185}$. It then follows that $\\sin{\\theta}=\\sqrt{1-\\cos^2{\\theta}}=\\frac{12\\sqrt{221}}{185}$.\nIt then follows that $m=\\tan{\\theta}=\\frac{12\\sqrt{221}}{49}$. Therefore $a=12$, $b=221$, and $c=49$. The desired answer is then $12+221+49=\\boxed{282}$.",
