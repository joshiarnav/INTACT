    "To find the area enclosed by the midpoints of the line segments in set $S$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the region enclosed by the midpoints:** The midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ form a quarter circle at each corner of the square. The radius of the quarter circle is 1, since the length of the line segments is 2, and the midpoint of the segment will be 1 unit away from the corner.\n\n2. **Find the area of the quarter circles:** The area of a quarter circle with radius 1 is $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi r^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\pi(1)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$. Since there are 4 quarter circles, one at each corner of the square, their total area is $4\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\pi$.\n\n3. **Find the area of the square:** The area of the square is $2^2 = 4$.\n\n4. **Find the area enclosed by the midpoints:** The area enclosed by the midpoints of the line segments is the difference between the area of the square and the area of the quarter circles: $4 - \\pi \\approx 4 - 3.14 = 0.86$. The area to the nearest hundredth is $k = 0.86$.\n\n5. **Find $100k$:** Multiply $k$ by 100 to get $100k = 100(0.86) = 86$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{86}$",
