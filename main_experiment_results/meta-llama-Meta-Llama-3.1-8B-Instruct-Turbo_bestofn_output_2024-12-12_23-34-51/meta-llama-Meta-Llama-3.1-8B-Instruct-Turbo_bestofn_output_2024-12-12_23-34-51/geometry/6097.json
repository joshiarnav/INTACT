    "To find the answer, we'll break down the problem into several steps.\n\nStep 1: Rewrite the circle equations\nWe start by rewriting the circle equations given in the problem in standard form. This gives us:\n\n$$(x+5)^2-25 + (y-12)^2 -144 = 87$$\n\nand\n\n$$(x-5)^2-25 + (y-12)^2-144= -153$$\n\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\n\n$$(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 256$$\n\nand\n\n$$(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 16$$\n\nThese are the standard forms of circles $w_1$ and $w_2$, which have radii $16$ and $4$ respectively.\n\nStep 2: Find the center and radius of the desired circle\nLet the center of the desired circle be $(x,y)$. Since this circle is externally tangent to $w_2$ and internally tangent to $w_1$, the distance between the center of the desired circle and the center of $w_2$ is the sum of their radii, which is $4 + 16 = 20$. Similarly, the distance between the center of the desired circle and the center of $w_1$ is the difference of their radii, which is $16 - 4 = 12$.\n\nStep 3: Find the center of the desired circle\nWe can write the equation of the circle $w_2$ as:\n\n$$(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 16$$\n\nLet the center of this circle be $A=(5,12)$. Since the circle with center $(x,y)$ is externally tangent to $w_2$, the distance between $(x,y)$ and $A$ is $20$. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$$(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 20^2$$\n\nSimilarly, let the center of the circle $w_1$ be $B=(-5,12)$. Since the circle with center $(x,y)$ is internally tangent to $w_1$, the distance between $(x,y)$ and $B$ is $12$. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$$(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 12^2$$\n\nStep 4: Find the equation of line containing the centers of the desired circle\nNow we have a system of two circle equations with two unknown variables $(x, y)$. Subtracting these two circle equations gives $-8x = 592$. \n\nSolving for x we get $x = -74$\n \nSubstituting $x$ in $y = ax$ we get\n$y = a * -74$\nStep 5: Calculate the slope of the line containing the center of the desired circle\n\nThe value of a is the slope of the line containing the center of the desired circle.\n\nSince $x = -74$, the $y$ axis becomes $y = -74a$\n\nUsing the point to slope form of a line \n $y - y_1 = m (x - x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope\nSubstituting $(x,y)$ with $(-74, -74a)$ \n We get,\n $y - -74a = m (x - -74)$\n\n\n\nStep 6: Solve for a\n\n$(y+74a) = m( -74 -x )$\n\nNow,\n$-74a+74a=m(-74+-74)$ \n\nSince $-74a+74a=0$\n\namultiplication on both sides in $74$ on both sides \n\nUsing distributive property \n\n$74m=74(-74)$ \n\nDividing both sides by $74$\n$\\frac {74m}{74}=\\frac {74 *-74}{74}$\n $\\frac{74m}{74}=-74$\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac 1 74$ \n\n$ m = -74 * \\frac 1{74}$\n  $m=-1$\n\nWe don't have to find the value of a because we already arrived at a value of m in the last step, which equals -1. If a in $y= ax$ equals $-1$ the most negative value, then a would be 1/ -1=-1 which would give us a= -1 when substituted for $m$ in $m^2 =\\frac p q$\n\n\nStep 7: Find the value of $p+q$\n\nWe found $m = -1$\n\nNow,\n$m^2 =(-1)^2$\n $m^2 = 1$\nTherefore, $$\\frac p q = \\frac {1}{1} =1$$\n\n\n\nStep 8: Calculate $p+q$\n\n$p = 1$\n\n$q= 1$\n\nNow,\n $p+q = 1 + 1 = 2$\n\nTherefore, \n $$p+q = \\boxed{2}$$",
    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Completions of Squares**: We'll start by completing the squares for both given equations of circles to find their centers. \n\nFor $x^2+y^2+10x-24y-87=0$, let's complete the squares:\n\\[(x^2+10x) + (y^2-24y) = 87\\]\n\\[(x^2+10x +25) + (y^2-24y+144) = 87+25+144\\]\n\\[(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 256\\]\nSo, the center of the first circle, $w_1$, is $(-5, 12)$.\n\nFor $x^2+y^2-10x-24y+153=0$, we follow the same procedure:\n\\[(x^2-10x) + (y^2-24y) = -153\\]\n\\[(x^2-10x +25) + (y^2-24y+144) = -153+25+144\\]\n\\[(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 16\\]\nThus, the center of the second circle, $w_2$, is $(5, 12)$.\n\n2. **Radius and Tangency Condition**: We know that the radius of $w_1$ is $\\sqrt{256} = 16$ and the radius of $w_2$ is $\\sqrt{16} = 4$. Let's denote the center of the circle we're looking for as $(x, ax)$, since it should lie on the line $y = ax$. Let the radius of this circle be $r$.\n\nAlso, from the condition of internal and external tangency, we deduce:\n\\[r+4 = 16-r\\] (Since the distance between the centers of the two circles is the difference of their radii plus the radius of the circle we are looking for.)\n\\[r = 6\\]\n\n3. **Equation of the Circle**: We know the radius and the center of the circle we are looking for. Thus, the equation of the circle is:\n\\[(x-5)^2 + (ax-12)^2 = 36\\]\n\n4. **Simplification**: Now we'll simplify the equation from step 3 by expanding and combining like terms:\n\\[x^2 -10x + 25 + a^2x^2 -24ax +144 = 36\\]\n\\[a^2x^2 + x^2 - (10+24a)x +169  = 0\\]\nWe need to find a value of $a$ for which the line $y = ax$ contains the center of this circle, meaning we need to find an $a$ that makes this equation factorable into two linear equations.\n\n5. **Condition for $a$**: Since we know that $(5, 12)$ is a point on $y=ax$, we can substitute $(x, y) = (5,12)$ into $y=ax$ and solve for $a$:\n\\[12 = 5a \\]\n\\[a = \\frac{12}{5}\\]\n\nHowever, we must ensure that this $a$ satisfies the conditions of external and internal tangency. Since $a$ should minimize the value $(p + q)$ in $m^2 = \\frac{p}{q}$, we'll check for smaller $a$ by finding the distance between the centers of the two circles and setting it equal to $6 + 4$ (the difference of radii of the two circles and the radius of the circle in question).\n\n6. **Checking Distance**: The distance between the centers is given by:\n\\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 = (5-(-5))^2 + (12 - 12)^2\\]\n\\[= 10^2 + 0^2 = 100\\]\nWe know that the distance between the centers must be equal to the difference between the radii plus the radius of the circle in question:\n\\[100 = 10 + 6\\]\nThis is true but we're not using this information to find $a$. Instead, we're going to verify the given $(p+q)$.\nHowever, in $m^2 = \\frac{p}{q}$, $a$ appears to be directly related to the answer we are seeking. Let us continue this line of work.\n\n7. **Checking other values of $a$**: If the answer $m^2 = \\frac{p}{q}$ is correct, then $\\frac{p}{q} = \\left(\\frac{12}{5}\\right)^2$.\n\\[\\frac{p}{q} = \\left(\\frac{12}{5}\\right)^2\\]\n\\[\\frac{p}{q} = \\frac{144}{25}\\]\n\nSince $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime, we can conclude that the smallest positive $a$ that makes the line $y = ax$ contain the center of the circle that is externally tangent to $w_2$ and internally tangent to $w_1$ is indeed  $\\frac{12}{5}$.\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{169}$",
    "To find the smallest positive value of $a$ for which the line $y=ax$ contains the center of a circle that is externally tangent to $w_2$ and internally tangent to $w_1,$ let's first rewrite the circle equations in standard form to find the centers and radii of the circles.\n\nThe first circle equation can be rewritten as follows:\n$x^2+y^2+10x-24y-87=0$\n$(x+5)^2-25+(y-12)^2-144-87=0$\n$(x+5)^2+(y-12)^2=256$\nTherefore, the center of the first circle is $(-5, 12)$, and its radius is 16.\n\nThe second circle equation can be rewritten as follows:\n$x^2+y^2-10x-24y+153=0$\n$(x-5)^2-25+(y-12)^2-144+153=0$\n$(x-5)^2+(y-12)^2=16$\nTherefore, the center of the second circle is $(5, 12)$, and its radius is 4.\n\nNow, we are looking for the center of a circle that is externally tangent to $w_2$ and internally tangent to $w_1$. Let the center of this circle be $(x, 12+\\frac{64}{a})$ since the center lies on the line $y=ax$. \n\nSince this circle is externally tangent to $w_2$, its radius plus 4 must equal the distance from its center to the center of $w_2$ plus 4:\n$$(x-5)^2+(12+\\frac{64}{a}-12)^2=(4+r)^2$$\nSince we are looking for the smallest $a$ and the center has to be on the line, we can write the equation in the following way by substituting the value of $r$ into the equation for $a$ in terms of $x$:\n$$(x-5)^2+(\\frac{64}{a})^2=(4+\\frac{64}{a})^2$$\n\nWe can expand the squares on both sides of the equation and then solve for $a$ in terms of $x$. However, we must take into account that the center of the circle must also be internally tangent to the first circle, so the equation will become the same as the one above in the case that the circle touches at the bottommost point. In order to do so, we will rewrite the circle equation of the first circle as:\n$$(x+5)^2+(y-12)^2=256$$\n\nNow, in the case that the circle touches at the bottommost point, the distance between the centers of the circles would then be the radius of the circle plus the radius of the first circle:\n$$\\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (12+\\frac{64}{a}-12)^2} = 16+\\frac{64}{a}$$\n\nSquaring both sides and expanding we get:\n$$ (x+5)^2+(\\frac{64}{a})^2 = (16+\\frac{64}{a})^2$$ \n\nThe two equations above for $a$ and $x$ can be rewritten in the following way:\n$$(x-5)^2+(\\frac{64}{a})^2=(4+\\frac{64}{a})^2$$\n$$(x+5)^2+(\\frac{64}{a})^2=(16+\\frac{64}{a})^2$$ \n\nExpanding both squares on both sides of the equation:\n$$x^2-10x+25+\\frac{4096}{a^2}=\\frac{256}{a^2}+16\\cdot\\frac{64}{a}+256$$\n$$x^2+10x+25+\\frac{4096}{a^2}=\\frac{4096}{a^2}+16\\cdot\\frac{64}{a}+1024$$\n\nOn both equations, cancel the $\\frac{4096}{a^2}$ on both sides:\n$$x^2-10x+25=\\frac{256}{a^2}+16\\cdot\\frac{64}{a}+256$$\n$$x^2+10x+25=\\frac{4096}{a^2}+16\\cdot\\frac{64}{a}+1024$$\n\nLet's subtract 25 from both sides of both equations:\n$$x^2-10x =\\frac{256}{a^2}+16\\cdot\\frac{64}{a}+231$$\n$$x^2+10x =\\frac{4096}{a^2}+16\\cdot\\frac{64}{a}+999$$\n\nAdd the two equations to eliminate the variable $x$:\n$$2x^2 =\\frac{4352}{a^2}+32\\cdot\\frac{64}{a}+1230$$\n\nDividing by 2 on both sides we get:\n$$x^2 =\\frac{2176}{a^2}+16\\cdot\\frac{64}{a}+615.5$$\n\nNow we must find the value of $x$ for which we get the smallest value of $a$. In order to do so, we need the value of $a$ to be real and the smallest, for this, we need to analyze the equation above and find the range for $a$.\n\nWe must take into account that the coefficients of $x^2$ in the two equations are opposite, so, to make the value of the expression the smallest, we must choose the coefficient of $x^2$ bigger. That is the case of the equation in which the coefficient of $x^2$ is 1. The equation is:\n$$x^2 = \\frac{2176}{a^2}+16\\cdot\\frac{64}{a}+615.5$$\n\nThe square of the center $x$ of the circle is, therefore, a rational plus an irrational number. Since we are looking for the smallest $a$ for which this circle is internally tangent to the circle $x^2+y^2+10x-24y-87=0$ and externally tangent to the circle $x^2 +y^2-10x-24y+153=0$, the value of $x$ is 0.\n\n\tTo prove it, we need to take into account the following equation in which the centers of the two circles are the centers of the initial circles and the center of the new circle:\n\t$$\\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (12+\\frac{64}{a}-12)^2} = 16+\\frac{64}{a}$$\n\nSquaring both sides and expanding we get:\n$$(x+5)^2+(\\frac{64}{a})^2 = (16+\\frac{64}{a})^2$$ \n\nExpanding both squares on both sides of the equation:\n$$x^2+10x+25+\\frac{4096}{a^2}=\\frac{4096}{a^2}+16\\cdot\\frac{64}{a}+256$$\n\nCancel the $\\frac{4096}{a^2}$ on both sides and the equation in the following form is obtained:\n$$x^2+10x =16\\cdot\\frac{64}{a}+231$$\n\nDivide by 16 on both sides to obtain:\n$$\\frac{x^2+10x}{16} = 4\\cdot\\frac{64}{a}+\\frac{231}{16}$$\n\nLet $y=\\frac{x^2+10x}{16}$.

So we have\n\\begin{align*} r + 4 &= \\sqrt{(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\\\ 16 - r &= \\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\end{align*}\nSolving for $r$ in both equations and setting them equal, then simplifying, yields\n\\begin{align*} 20 - \\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2} &= \\sqrt{(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\\\ 20+x &= 2\\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\end{align*}\nSquaring again and canceling yields $1 = \\frac{x^2}{100} + \\frac{(y-12)^2}{75}.$\nSo the locus of points that can be the center of the circle with the desired properties is an ellipse.\n[asy] size(220); pointpen = black; pen d = linewidth(0.7); pathpen = d;  pair A = (-5, 12), B = (5, 12), C = (0, 0); D(CR(A,16));D(CR(B,4));D(shift((0,12)) * yscale(3^.5 / 2) * CR(C,10), linetype(\"2 2\") + d + red); D((0,30)--(0,-10),Arrows(4));D((15,0)--(-25,0),Arrows(4));D((0,0)--MP(\"y=ax\",(14,14 * (69/100)^.5),E),EndArrow(4));  void bluecirc (real x) {  pair P = (x, (3 * (25 - x^2 / 4))^.5 + 12); dot(P, blue);  D(CR(P, ((P.x - 5)^2 + (P.y - 12)^2)^.5 - 4) , blue + d + linetype(\"4 4\")); }  bluecirc(-9.2); bluecirc(-4); bluecirc(3); [/asy]\nSince the center lies on the line $y = ax$, we substitute for $y$ and expand:\\[1 = \\frac{x^2}{100} + \\frac{(ax-12)^2}{75} \\Longrightarrow (3+4a^2)x^2 - 96ax + 276 = 0.\\]\nWe want the value of $a$ that makes the line $y=ax$ tangent to the ellipse, which will mean that for that choice of $a$ there is only one solution to the most recent equation. But a quadratic has one solution iff its discriminant is $0$, so $(-96a)^2 - 4(3+4a^2)(276) = 0$.\nSolving yields $a^2 = \\frac{69}{100}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{169}$.",
