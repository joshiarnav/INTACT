  "problem": "A right circular cone has base radius $r$ and height $h$. The cone lies on its side on a flat table. As the cone rolls on the surface of the table without slipping, the point where the cone's base meets the table traces a circular arc centered at the point where the vertex touches the table. The cone first returns to its original position on the table after making $17$ complete rotations. The value of $h/r$ can be written in the form $m\\sqrt {n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n$.\n",

    "To solve this problem, let's consider the path traced by the rolling cone. This path is a circle with a radius equal to the slant height of the cone. The slant height is given by the formula $\\sqrt {r^2 + h^2}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between the radius of the rolling path (the slant height of the cone) and the distance traveled by the cone. When the cone makes one complete rotation, it travels a distance equal to the circumference of the base of the cone, which is $2\\pi r$.\n\nHowever, the cone also rolls around its vertex, which means that the distance traveled around the rolling path is a multiple of the circumference of the base of the cone. This multiple is the same as the number of rotations the cone makes, which is $17$ in this case.\n\nLet's define the radius of the rolling path as $L$, which is also the slant height of the cone. The distance around the rolling path is $2\\pi L$. Since the cone makes $17$ rotations, the distance around the rolling path is equal to $17$ times the circumference of the base of the cone:\n\n$2\\pi L = 17(2\\pi r)$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$L = 17r$\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the slant height to the height and radius of the cone:\n\n$\\sqrt {r^2 + h^2} = 17r$\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n$r^2 + h^2 = 289r^2$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$h^2 = 288r^2$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n$h = \\sqrt {288}r$\n\n$h = 12\\sqrt {2}r$\n\n$\\frac {h}{r} = 12\\sqrt {2}$\n\nNow, we can sum $m$ and $n$, where $m = 12$ and $n = 2$.\n\n$12 + 2 = \\boxed{14}$",

    "To solve this problem, we need to consider the relationship between the angle of rotation of the cone, the total angle of rotation required for the cone to return to its original position, and the dimensions of the cone.\n\nWhen the cone rolls without slipping, the distance it covers is equal to the circumference of the circle it traces on the table. This is because the cone rolls without slipping, so the distance covered by the cone is proportional to the circumference of the circle it traces.\n\nLet's consider the path of the center of the base of the cone as it rolls on the table. The path of the center of the base of the cone traces a circle of radius equal to the slant height of the cone, which we'll call $l$. The total distance the center of the base of the cone travels is equal to the circumference of this circle.\n\nThe circumference of the circle traced by the center of the base of the cone is $2\\pi l$. However, this is also equal to the total distance covered by the cone while making $17$ complete rotations. We can use this information to equate the two.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between the angles of rotation of the cone, the total angle of rotation required for the cone to return to its original position, and the dimensions of the cone. \n\nThe total angle of rotation required for the cone to return to its original position is $360^{\\circ}$. However, since the cone makes $17$ complete rotations, the total angle of rotation is actually $17 \\times 360^{\\circ} = 6120^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe angle of rotation of the cone can be related to the dimensions of the cone using trigonometry. Let's consider a cross-section of the cone, which looks like a right triangle. The angle of rotation of the cone is the same as the angle between the hypotenuse of the triangle and the base of the triangle.\n\nUsing the definition of the sine function, we can write:\n\n$\\sin{\\theta} = \\frac{r}{l}$.\n\nHowever, we also know that $\\cos{\\theta} = \\frac{h}{l}$.\n\nNow we must relate the circumference of the circle the cone makes to the circumference of the base of the cone.\n\nThe circumference of the circle traced by the center of the base of the cone is $2\\pi l$, where $l$ is the slant height of the cone. The circumference of the base of the cone is $2\\pi r$.\n\nWe can set the two equal to each other, since the total distance covered by the cone while making $17$ complete rotations is equal to the circumference of the circle traced by the center of the base of the cone:\n\n$l = \\frac{17 r}{\\tan{\\theta}}$.\n\nNow substitute $\\cos{\\theta} = \\frac{h}{l}$ into $l = \\frac{17 r}{\\tan{\\theta}}$:\n\n$l = \\frac{17 r}{\\frac{1}{\\cos{\\theta}}}$\n\n$l = 17r\\cos{\\theta}$\n\nNow substitute this expression for $l$ into the formula for the circumference of the circle the cone makes:\n\n$2\\pi l = 2\\pi (17r\\cos{\\theta})$\n\nThis simplifies to: \n\n$(17)(2\\pi r)\\cos{\\theta}$\n\nSince $\\cos{\\theta} = \\frac{h}{l}$, we can substitute and obtain\n\n$l = 17r\\cos{\\theta}$\n\nSubstituting into $(17)(2\\pi r)\\cos{\\theta}$ we get\n\n$(17)(2\\pi r)\\frac{h}{l}$.\n\nHowever, since we equated $l$ and substituted we must use substitution $(17)(2\\pi r)\\frac{h}{17r\\cos{\\theta}}$ which simplifies to \n\n$\\frac{(17)(2\\pi r)h}{(17r)(\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}})$.\n\nSimplify to obtain $\\frac{(2\\pi)(h)}{(\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}})$\n\nNow, equate this to the circumference of the base of the cone:\n\n$\\frac{(2\\pi)(h)}{(\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2})} = 2\\pi r$.\n\nSolve for $h/r$ by multiplying both sides of the equation by $(\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2})$\n\n$(2\\pi)(h) = 2\\pi r (\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2})$.\n\nDivide both sides by $2\\pi r$.\n\n$h = r (\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2} ) /r$\n\nSimplify $r/r$ is 1\n\n$h = \\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n$h^2 = r^2 + h^2$\n\nSubtract $h^2$ from both sides:\n\n$0 = r^2$\n\nThis equation doesn't make sense for the problem, so let's try something different.\n\nConsider the equation: \n\n$\\frac{(2\\pi)(h)}{(\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2})} = 2\\pi r$.\n\nMultiply both sides by $(\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2})$\n\nthen \n\n$2\\pi h = 2\\pi r (\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2})$.\n\nDivide both sides by $2\\pi$\n\n$h = r \\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n$(h)^2 = (r)^2(\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2})^2$\n\nExpanding $(\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2})^2$ to $(r^2 + h^2)$\n\n$h^2 = r^2 (r^2 + h^2)$\n\nDivide both sides by $(r^2)$:\n\n$\\frac{h^2}{r^2} = (r^2 + h^2)$.\n\nExpand the fraction.\n\n$\\frac{h^2}{r^2} -  (r^2 + h^2) = 0$\n\nSimplify\n\n$\\frac{h^2}{r^2} - r^2 -h^2 = 0$\n\n$-h^2/r^2 +h^2 - r^2 =0$\n\nFactor out  $-h^2/r^2$:\n\n$\\frac{h^2}{r^2}( 1 -1) + h^2 - r^2 =0$\n\n$\\frac{h^2}{r^2}( 1 -1) = r^2 -h^2$\n\n$\\frac{0}{r^2} = r^2 - h^2$\n\nSimplify.\n\n$0 = r^2 - h^2$\n\nAdd $h^2$ to both sides:\n\n$h^2 = r^2$\n\nTake the square of both sides:\n\n$h = r$\n\nThis doesn't make sense for the problem, so let's try something else.\n\nConsider the problem:  The cone first returns to its original position on the table after making $17$ complete rotations.\n\nThis implies that the circular path traced by the center of the base of the cone has a circumference that is $17$ times the circumference of the base of the cone.\n\nConsider the equation:\n\n$c = 2 \\pi r$\n\nwhere $c$ is the circumference of the circle the cone makes and $r$ is the radius of the base of the cone.\n\nThe circumference of the circle the cone makes is $17$ times the circumference of the base of the cone. \n\nSo, we can set this up as:\n\n$17c = 2 \\pi l$\n\nSubstitute in $2 \\pi r$ for $c$.\n\n$17 (2 \\pi r) = 2 \\pi l$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$(17)(2 \\pi r) = 2 \\pi l$\n\nDivide both sides by $2 \\pi$.\n\n$17 r = l$\n\nNow substitute into the original equation:\n\n$l = \\frac{17 r}{\\cos{\\theta}}$\n\nWe must use substitution $17r$ for $l$.\n\n$17r = \\frac{17 r}{\\cos{\\theta}}$\n\nDivide both sides by $17r$\n\n$1 = \\frac{1}{\\cos{\\theta}}$\n\nTake the reciprocal of both sides.\n\n$\\cos{\\theta} = 1$\n\nSince, $\\cos{\\theta} = \\frac{h}{l}$, we can substitute in $1$ for $\\cos{\\theta}$.\n\n$\\frac{h}{l} = 1$\n\nMultiply both sides by $(l)$\n\n$h = l$\n\nSubstitute in $17r$ for $l$.\n\n$h = 17r$\n\nDivide both sides by $r$\n\n$\\frac{h}{r} = 17$\n\nSince, $\\frac{h}{r} = 17$ isn't in the form $m\\sqrt{n}$, we need to try something different.\n\nLet's consider the problem: The total distance the center of the base of the cone travels is equal to the circumference of the circle it traces.\n\nConsider the equation:\n\n$c = 2 \\pi l$\n\nwhere $c$ is the circumference of the circle the cone makes and $l$ is the slant height of the cone.\n\nThe circumference of the circle the cone makes is equal to $17$ times the circumference of the base of the cone.\n\n$c = 17(2 \\pi r)$\n\nSet this equal to $(2 \\pi l)$.\n\n$2 \\pi l = 17(2 \\pi r)$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$(2 \\pi l) = 17(2 \\pi r)$\n\nDivide both sides"
