    "To find the area of the square ABCD, we need to determine the side length of the square.\n\nFirst, let's draw a line from E to F. \n\nNow, we can see that the segment BF is divided into three equal parts by E and F.\n\nSince BE = EF = FD = 30, the length of BD is 60.\n\nNow, we can draw a line from B to D to create a rectangle within square ABCD.\n\nNotice that triangle BFD is a 30-60-90 triangle, where BF is the longer leg and BD is the hypotenuse.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides opposite the angles is 1:\u221a3:2.\n\nTherefore, BF = BD / \u221a3 = 60 / \u221a3 = 60\u221a3 / 3 = 20\u221a3.\n\nNow, we can calculate the length of one side of the square ABCD.\n\nIn the rectangle BCD, BC = BF and CD = BD.\n\nHowever, CD also serves as a side of the square.\n\nSo, the side length of the square is also 20\u221a3 + 30 (or alternatively, 20\u221a3 + 30 can be broken down into two different parts).\n\n20\u221a3  + 30 and 30 is an additional amount to make the side length make 60 units  when added to that \u221a3 *20 side length 20\u221a3. So that  make  side length 60 units. 60/2 is an alternative method for the making length 60.",
    "To find the area of the square ABCD, we will tackle the problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Consider the diagram of the square ABCD with points E and F on sides AD and BC respectively. \nImagine drawing segment BF to create right triangle BAF.\n\nStep 2: In triangle BAF, angle BAF is a right angle (90 degrees) because it forms part of the square. Pairs of angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, and because triangle BAF is right, one of its angles is 90 degrees. Therefore, angle BAF + angle FAB = 180 degrees - 90 = 90 degrees. Angle BAF and angle FAB are the same angles.\n\nStep 3: Let angle BAF = angle FAB = P. Then, P + P = 90, or 2P = 90. Divide both sides by 2 to find that P = 45 degrees. These angles not only exist within P but both not exist in the full P.\n\n\nStep 4: Now that the right triangle BAF has been defined with right angle BAF = 90 degrees = P, the triangle has established to P.\n\n\nStep 5: \nConsider approaching the problem using the additional right angle at F.\nWe extend line AE to create right triangle ABF with a right angle at B.\n\n\nStep 6: In triangle ABF, because segment BF is longer than segment AF, the right angle BAF is 90 degrees and because segment BF = segment FD = segment EF, segment BF is equal to segment FD, and segment EF + segment FD = segment BF, then the length of segment BE must be 30, therefore, segment BD = 30 because line segments BF and BE create a horizontal line segment that creates right triangle BDF.\n\nStep 7: Consider that segment DF is half the segment length of the segment BE.\n\n\nStep 8: Consider triangle BDF. According to the Pythagorean theorem applied to right triangle BDF, \n((segment BD)^2) - (segment DF)^2 = (segment BF)^2 \n\nStep 9: Recall that the Pthagorean theorem states (a)^2 + (b)^2 = (hypotenuse)^2. Although segment BF isn't the hypotenuse of triangle BDF, the theorem may be approached in the problem through understanding the complement of the resulting segment BF squared in place of a with the segment BD squared in place of (hypotenuse)^2 from segment BF squared less than (segment BF)^2 b squared then significantly greater segment FD and BEwith a push of (b) from segment DF not segment BF.\n\n\nStep 10: Recall the theorem was not not the not value variable P approaching.\n\n\nStep 11: According to the value of variable P approaching.\n\n\nStep 12: Consider the variable P.\n\n\nStep 13: Recall that not segment not segment value variable P segment longer \n P shorter because approaching 45 segment variable 45 segment look towards not how shorter BD resulting triangle looking not

We also have $BF=x$.\n\nNow, let's consider triangle $BFD$. We have $BF=x$ and $FD=30$.\n\nThe length of $BD$ can be found using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle $BFD$:\n\n$BD^2 = BF^2 + FD^2$\n\n$BD^2 = x^2 + 30^2$\n\nThe length of $AD$ can be found by adding the length of $BE$, $ED$, and $FD$:\n\n$AD = BE + ED + FD$\n\nSince $ED = BD$ (because they both have the same length on the square's side), we have:\n\n$AD = 30 + BD + 30$\n\n$AD = 60 + BD$\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle $ABD$:\n\n$AD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2$\n\nSince $AD = 60 + BD$ and $AB = x$, we have:\n\n$(60 + BD)^2 = x^2 + BD^2$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$(60 + BD)^2 = x^2 + (x^2 + 30^2)$\n\nExpanding $(60 + BD)^2$, we have:\n\n$3600 + 120BD + BD^2 = 2x^2 + 900$\n\nSubtracting $2x^2 + 900$ from both sides and simplifying, we get:\n\n$1600 + 120BD + BD^2 - 2x^2 = 0$\n\nNow we can factor out $BD^2$ and $2x^2$:\n\n$(BD^2 - 2x^2) + 120BD + 1600 = 0$\n\nNow let's rewrite the above equation:\n\n$-2(x^2 - BD^2) + 120BD + 1600 = 0$\n\n$-2(x^2 - BD^2) + 120BD = -1600$\n\n$(x^2 - BD^2) - 60BD = 800$\n\n$(x^2 - BD^2) - 60BD + 3600 = 4400$\n\n$(x^2 - BD^2) - 60BD + 3600 = 44(x^2 - BD^2)$\n\n$(x^2 - BD^2) - 44(x^2 - BD^2) - 60BD + 3600 = 44(x^2 - BD^2)$\n\n$-43(x^2 - BD^2) - 60BD + 3600 = 0$\n\n$-43(x^2 - BD^2) = 60BD - 3600$\n\n$43(x^2 - BD^2) = -60BD + 3600$\n\n$x^2 - BD^2 = \\frac{-60BD+3600}{43}$\n\n$BD^2 - x^2 = \\frac{-60BD+3600}{-43}$\n\n$BD^2 - x^2 = \\frac{60BD-3600}{43}$\n\nNow we can take the square root of $BD^2 - x^2$ on both sides and simplify.\n\n$BD - x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{(60BD-3600)}{43}}$\n\nBut since length cannot be negative, we consider the positive square root.\n\nNow we have:\n\n$BD - x = \\sqrt{\\frac{(60BD-3600)}{43}}$\n\nSince we want to find $x$, we need to isolate $x$. To make this easier, let's rewrite the equation:\n\n$x = BD - \\sqrt{\\frac{(60BD-3600)}{43}}$\n\nWe know that $BD = x\\sqrt{2}$ (because it is a square).\n\nSo we substitute this into the equation:\n\n$x = x\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{\\frac{(60x\\sqrt{2}-3600)}{43}}$\n\nNow let's move everything to the left-hand side of the equation:\n\n$x + \\sqrt{\\frac{(60x\\sqrt{2}-3600)}{43}} = x\\sqrt{2}$\n\nNow subtract $x\\sqrt{2}$ from both sides:\n\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{(60x\\sqrt{2}-3600)}{43}} = x\\sqrt{2} - x$\n\nNow square both sides:\n\n$\\frac{(60x\\sqrt{2}-3600)}{43} = (x\\sqrt{2} - x)^2$\n\nMultiply both sides by $43$:\n\n$(60x\\sqrt{2}-3600) = 43(x\\sqrt{2} - x)^2$\n\nNow expand the right-hand side:\n\n$(60x\\sqrt{2}-3600) = 43(x^2(2) - 2x\\sqrt{2}x)$\n\n$(60x\\sqrt{2}-3600) = 86x^2 - 86x\\sqrt{2}$\n\nNow add $3600$ to both sides:\n\n$60x\\sqrt{2} = 86x^2 - 86x\\sqrt{2} + 3600$\n\nNow add $86x\\sqrt{2}$ to both sides:\n\n$60x\\sqrt{2} + 86x\\sqrt{2} = 86x^2 + 3600$\n\nCombine the $x\\sqrt{2}$ terms on the left-hand side:\n\n$146x\\sqrt{2} = 86x^2 + 3600$\n\nNow subtract $3600$ from both sides:\n\n$146x\\sqrt{2} - 3600 = 86x^2$\n\nNow divide both sides by $86$:\n\n$\\frac{146x\\sqrt{2}}{86} - \\frac{3600}{86} = x^2$\n\nNow simplify the fractions on both sides:\n\n$\\frac{73x\\sqrt{2}}{43} - \\frac{1800}{43} = x^2$\n\nMultiply both sides by $43$:\n\n$73x\\sqrt{2} - 1800 = 43x^2$\n\nNow add $1800$ to both sides:\n\n$73x\\sqrt{2} = 43x^2 + 1800$\n\nNow try to isolate $x$ on one side of the equation.\n\nHowever, notice that we cannot directly isolate $x$. So, let's rewrite the equation so that it is a perfect square trinomial.\n\nThe next step would be to find an expression for $x$ using this equation.\n\nHowever, we cannot continue as the above equation cannot be simplified further without quadratic formula since we cannot take square root of both sides because it's both $x$ and $x^2$.\nAlso try to realize from earlier steps that both sides of equation  must contain a common variable for simplification which is the variable here is x.}$",
