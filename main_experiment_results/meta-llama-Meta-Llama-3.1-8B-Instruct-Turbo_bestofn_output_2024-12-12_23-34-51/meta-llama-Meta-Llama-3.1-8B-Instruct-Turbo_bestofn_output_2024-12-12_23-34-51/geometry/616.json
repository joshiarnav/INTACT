    "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to consider the triangle inequality theorem. The triangle inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nGiven sides of length 5 and 6 units, and the third side of length $x$ units, we can set up the following inequalities:\n\n1. $x + 5 > 6$\n2. $x + 6 > 5$\n3. $5 + 6 > x$\n\nSimplifying these inequalities, we get:\n\n1. $x > 1$\n2. $x > -1$ (this is always true for positive $x$)\n3. $11 > x$\n\nSince $x$ must be an integer, we can combine the first and third inequalities to get:\n\n$1 < x < 11$\n\nThe largest possible integer value for $x$ within this range is 10.\n\nNow, we can calculate the largest possible perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = $x + 5 + 6$\n= $10 + 5 + 6$\n= $\\boxed{21}$",
    "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to find the largest possible value of the third side, which is x.\n\nAccording to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. \n\nLet's apply this theorem to our problem:\n\n- The sum of the lengths of sides 5 and 6 (the other two sides) must be greater than x. So, 5 + 6 > x, which simplifies to 11 > x.\n- The sum of the length of side 5 and the unknown side x must be greater than 6, which gives 5 + x > 6, or x > 1.\n- The sum of the length of side 6 and the unknown side x must be greater than 5, which gives 6 + x > 5, or x > -1. Since x must be a positive integer, we ignore this condition.\n\nNow, we combine the first two conditions, x must be greater than 1 and less than 11, as 11 is the upper bound for x.\n\nThe largest integer value of x that satisfies the conditions is 10, as it is the largest number less than 11.\n\nNow that we know x equals 10, we can calculate the perimeter of the triangle. The perimeter is given by:\n\nP = 5 + 6 + 10\nP = 21\n\nTherefore, the largest possible perimeter of the triangle is:\n\n$\\boxed{21}$",
    "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to consider the triangle inequality theorem. The theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be less than or equal to the length of the remaining side.\n\nLet's denote the lengths of the sides as follows: \n- Side 1: 5 units\n- Side 2: 6 units\n- Side 3: x units (where x is an integer)\n\nWe need to apply the triangle inequality theorem to find the range of possible values for x.\n\nCase 1: x is the longest side\n- According to the theorem, the sum of the lengths of the other two sides (5 and 6) must be less than or equal to x.\n- This gives us the inequality: 5 + 6 \u2264 x, which simplifies to 11 \u2264 x.\n\nCase 2: x is the middle-sized side\n- The length of x must be greater than the difference between the lengths of the other two sides and less than their sum.\n- The length of x must be greater than 6 - 5 and less than 5 + 6.\n- This gives us the range of inequalities: 1 < x < 11.\n\nCase 3: x is the shortest side\n- The length of x must be less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides and greater than their difference.\n- This gives us the inequality: x < 5 + 6 or x < 11.\n\nHowever, we have already concluded that in Case 1, we have 11 \u2264 x. The correct way to solve this is to perform a combination of those cases \u2013 Case 1 & 2. Therefore, for x to be at its largest possible value, it needs to satisfy conditions from Cases 1 and 2.\n\nGiven that the two possible cases are:\n11 \u2264 x and x < 11.\n\nWhen we look at both possibilities, x must be greater than or equal to 11, to be at its maximum value and also be an integer."

  "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",
