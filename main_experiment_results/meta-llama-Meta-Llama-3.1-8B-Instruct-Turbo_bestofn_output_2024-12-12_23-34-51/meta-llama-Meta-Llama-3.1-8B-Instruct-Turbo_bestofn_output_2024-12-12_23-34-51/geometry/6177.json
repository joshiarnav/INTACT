    "Let's start by understanding the problem. A point in the unit square region is called $n$-ray partitional if there are $n$ rays emanating from that point that divide the region into $n$ triangles of equal area.\n\nTo approach this problem, let's consider the way the rays divide the square into triangles of equal area. The rays emanate from the point and intersect the boundary of the square.\n\nLet's consider the square's vertices as $A, B, C,$ and $D$. For any $100$-ray partitional point $X$, there will be two $100$ rays emanating from $X$ to each of the square's sides parallel to the two adjacent sides, forming right-angled triangles of equal area and a $50$-ray partitional point on each of the square's sides.\n\nTo count the number of $100$-ray partitional points, let's consider the fact that each side has a point $(x, 0)$ that is $50$-ray partitional. For any $50$-ray partitional point $P$ on a side, the $100$ rays emanating from $P$ to the adjacent sides must be parallel to the side that $P$ lies on.\n\nLet's now consider how to count the $50$-ray partitional points on each side of the square and ensure they do not intersect any of the sides of the square.\n\nFor any point of the form $(1 - y, 0)$ and $(0, 1 - y)$ for $y > 0$, we only need one ray to partition the two adjacent triangles. By examining the figure, we see that for any such point to be part of a $50$-ray partitional point, the two rays emanating from the point and going to each of the adjacent sides must make an angle of $\\frac{3\\pi}{50}$, and we denote these rays as the green rays in the figure.\n\n\nThe key idea here is to observe that the two green rays emanating from any $50$-ray partitional point on a side make an angle of $\\frac{3\\pi}{50}$ and their intersection point must lie between the two $100$-ray partitional rays emanating from the point to the adjacent sides.\n\nTo be a $50$-ray partitional point, the line formed by connecting the two $50$-ray partitional rays emanating from a point on a side to the adjacent side must make an angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{100}$ with the side of the square.\n\n\nLet's now find the equation of the line formed by connecting the two $50$-ray partitional rays emanating from the point $(1 - y, 0)$ to the adjacent side. If this line makes an angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{100}$ with the side of the square, its slope will be $\\left( \\tan \\frac{\\pi}{100} \\right)$.\n\nBy using similar triangles, if we draw a line parallel to the line formed by connecting the two 50-ray partitional rays emanating from the point (1 - y, 0) to the adjacent side, its slope will be (tan \u03c0/50 ).\n\n\nUsing this approach, we can establish a relationship between y and tan \u03c0/50 and tan \u03c0/100. Let us find the implicit equation of tan \u03c0/50(x) = tan \u03c0/100.\n\n\nVisually, it is obvious that the two equations must have a unique solution that is between 0 and 1 or to the right of it or beyond 1 on the x-axis.\n\nVisually, we can verify that this is indeed the case and as we add an infinity of equations of the form:\n\n\n-tan \u03c0/100 = (tan \u03b1)(x - y(x)).\n\nVisually, we can verify that if x is greater than 1 or if it is less than or equal to 1, it will produce a finite solution and we can quickly verify this solution using algebra and we will add all these equations.\n\n\nLet's now consider how to count the $50$-ray partitional points on each side of the square, taking into consideration all previous equations.\n\n\nNow that we have all these equations, we can add all of them up, and we will only do an algebraic check using this equation:\n\n\n500 - 5y + 2y^2 = (tan \u03c0/50)(2y).\n\nNow that we have done the algebraic check to be satisfied with this equation, let's now count the number of solutions to this equation that are in the interval [0, 1].\n\nFrom there, we can compute the number of 50-ray partitional points on each side, since we have y in the equation from the implicit equation that we derived.\n\n\nNow let's count the number of points that are 100-ray partitional but not 60-ray partitional.\n\nIn this question, we need to take into account all these points on each side and ensure they do not intersect any of the sides of the square, and then we can add all the points up.\n\n\nNow let's count the number of points that are 100-ray partitional but not 60-ray partitional.\n\nUsing all previous equations and relationships that we established and counting the 50-ray partitional points on each side of the square, we can count the number of points on each side of the square that are 100-ray partitional, taking into consideration that we cannot have any points on any side of the square that are 100-ray partitional but not 60-ray partitional.\n\n\nNow we have to count the number of points on each side of the square that are 100-ray partitional but not 60-ray partitional.\n\n\nLet's now add all the points on each side to find the total number of points that are 100-ray partitional but not 60-ray partitional.\n\n\nNow we have to count the number of points on each side of the square that are 100-ray partitional but not 60-ray partitional.\n\n\nLet's now add all the points on each side to find the total number of points that are 100-ray partitional but not 60-ray partitional.\n\nLet's first count the number of points on the bottom left side.\n\nVisually, we can verify that there is a point (1 - y, 0), where y = (100 - 5 sqrt (10000 - 4 ) )/ 200, that is on the line of 100-ray partitional points and is not 60-ray partitional and we can find the 50-ray partitional points and ensure they do not intersect with the adjacent side.\n\n\nNow let's add the solution y = (100 - 5 sqrt (10000 - 4 ) )/ 200 to the equation that we derived and compute the value of y modulo 1.\n\n\nUsing this relationship and previous equations, we can compute the total number of 50-ray partitional points and ensure they do not intersect with the adjacent side.\n\nSince only the points on the bottom left side and the top right side will make an angle of \u03c0/100 with the adjacent side and their intersection point must lie between the two 100-ray partitional rays emanating from the point to the adjacent side, and ensure they do not intersect with the adjacent side.\n\n\nNow that we have already established y = (100 - 5 sqrt (10000 - 4 ) )/ 200 modulo 1, it follows that the total number of points that are 100-ray partitional but not 60-ray partitional is  2320.\n\nFinally, the solution is:\n\n$\\boxed{2320}$",
    "To find the points that are $100$-ray partitional but not $60$-ray partitional, let's first understand the geometric configuration.\n\nA point $X$ is $n$-ray partitional if there are $n$ rays emanating from $X$ that divide the square $R$ into $n$ triangles of equal area.\n\nFirst, we find the locations of the points that are $100$-ray partitional.\n\nThe $100$-ray partitional points occur when the rays emanating from $X$ divide the square into $100$ triangles of equal area. The configuration of these points resembles the grid of the square, where each point is at a distance of $\\frac{1}{2}$ from the sides of the square. \n\nWe can imagine that the square is divided into $100$ smaller squares of equal area by drawing lines from the midpoints of the sides of the larger square. Each of these smaller squares, when intersected by rays emanating from the center of the square, would divide the square into $100$ triangles of equal area. This also implies that there are $100$ points, each with a distance of $\\frac{1}{2}$ from the sides of the square, that can divide it into $100$ triangles of equal area.\n\nNext, we find the locations of the points that are $60$-ray partitional.\n\nSimilarly, the $60$-ray partitional points occur when the rays emanating from $X$ divide the square into $60$ triangles of equal area. These points also resemble the grid of the square, where each point is at a distance of $\\frac{1}{2}$ from the sides of the square.\n\nThe configuration of the $60$-ray partitional points will have a $3 \\times 20$ grid inside the square, with another $20 \\times 3$ grid inside the square and its diagonals forming $60$ triangles.\n\nWe find that we cannot cover all of the points in the $100$-grid with a $60$-grid configuration. This leaves us with a $3 \\times 20$ sub-grid that is common to both grids and a $1 \\times 20$ sub-grid that is unique to the $100$-grid.\n\nThe number of points $100$-ray partitional, but not $60$-ray partitional would then be the number of points in the $1 \\times 20$ sub-grid, which is $(1)(20) = 20$ points on each side of the square and $20 \\cdot 3 = 60$ points along the diagonals of the square, and at the corners of the square, $4$ points. So the answer is $20(2) + 60 + 4$ - which is $1560$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{1560}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the points that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet's consider the $100$-ray partitional points. These points are located at the intersections of the diagonals of the triangles formed by $10$ rays emanating from $X$ and extending to the edges of the square region $R$.\n\nTo simplify the diagram, let's sub-divide the region $R$ into $10 \\times 10 = 100$ equal square regions.\n\nEach $100$-ray partitional point $X$ is located at the center of $10 \\times 10 = 100$ units of $1 \\times 1$ regions. There are $10 \\times 10 = 100$ such units.\n\nNow, let's consider the $60$-ray partitional points. Similar to the previous case, these points are located at the intersections of the diagonals of the triangles formed by $12$ rays emanating from $X$ and extending to the edges of the square region $R$.\n\nWe can also divide the region $R$ into $12 \\times 12 = 144$ equal square regions, and each $60$-ray partitional point $X$ is located at the center of $12 \\times 12 = 144$ units of $1 \\times 1$ regions.\n\nHowever, we notice that a $60$-ray partitional point $X$ is also a $100$-ray partitional point $X$ if the point is located at the center of $10 \\times 10 = 100$ units, $3 \\times 4 = 12$ times, corresponding to the four corners and eight midpoints of the sides of a $3 \\times 4$ sub-square within the $10 \\times 10$ grid units.\n\nIt turns out that this $3 \\times 4$ sub-square is the key to solving the problem.\n\nConsider the four corners of this $3 \\times 4$ sub-square. For each corner, $10$ rays emanating from the corner point form a diagonal of this $3 \\times 4$ sub-square and thus form $4$ triangles.\n\nConsider the eight midpoints of the sides of this $3 \\times 4$ sub-square. For each midpoint, $10$ rays emanating from the midpoint form $3$ diagonals of the triangles.\n\nConsider the four $1 \\times 1$ regions in the $3 \\times 4$ sub-square. For each $1 \\times 1$ region, $10$ rays emanating from the point $X$ form a $1 \\times 4$ region.\n\nIn the $3 \\times 4$ sub-square, there are $4 \\times 10 = 40$ rays forming $4 \\times 4 = 16$ triangles, $8 \\times 3 = 24$ rays forming $3 \\times 3 = 9$ triangles, and $4 \\times 1 \\times 10 = 40$ rays forming $1 \\times 4 = 4$ triangles.\n\nSince we have the same number of rays forming triangles in the $3 \\times 4$ sub-square as in the rest of the $10 \\times 10$ grid units, we have a $1:1$ correspondence between the points in the two sets.\n\nThis $1:1$ correspondence implies that a point in the $3 \\times 4$ sub-square is both $100$-ray partitional and $60$-ray partitional.\n\nSince a point is $100$-ray partitional if and only if it is not in any of the $3 \\times 4$ sub-squares, we have $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ points that are $100$-ray partitional but not $60$-ray partitional within each $10 \\times 10$ grid unit.\n\nThere are $10 \\times 10 = 100$ such units within the $10 \\times 10$ grid.\n\nHowever, this does not account for the points located on the $3 \\times 4$ sub-squares that have their $3 \\times 4$ sub-square overlapping with another $3 \\times 4$ sub-square.\n\nThere are two sets of these overlapping sub-squares. There are $2 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 72$ such points for each set, corresponding to the points in one of the overlapping $3 \\times 4$ sub-squares.\n\nSince there are two such sets, we need to add $72 + 72 = 144$ points to our total count.\n\nTherefore, we have a total of $64 \\times 100 + 144 = 8064 + 144 = 8208$ points that are $100$-ray partitional but not $60$-ray partitional within the units of $1 \\times 1$ regions corresponding to the $10 \\times 10$ grid units.\n\nHowever, we notice that this answer exceeds the units of $1 \\times 1$ corresponding to the $10 \\times 10$ grid units by $4^2 = 16$ times.\n\nTo find the final answer, we need to divide $8208$ by $16$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{514}$."

  "solution": "There must be four rays emanating from $X$ that intersect the four corners of the square region. Depending on the location of $X$, the number of rays distributed among these four triangular sectors will vary. We start by finding the corner-most point that is $100$-ray partitional (let this point be the bottom-left-most point).\nWe first draw the four rays that intersect the vertices. At this point, the triangular sectors with bases as the sides of the square that the point is closest to both do not have rays dividing their areas. Therefore, their heights are equivalent since their areas are equal. The remaining $96$ rays are divided among the other two triangular sectors, each sector with $48$ rays, thus dividing these two sectors into $49$ triangles of equal areas.\nLet the distance from this corner point to the closest side be $a$ and the side of the square be $s$. From this, we get the equation $\\frac{a\\times s}{2}=\\frac{(s-a)\\times s}{2}\\times\\frac1{49}$. Solve for $a$ to get $a=\\frac s{50}$. Therefore, point $X$ is $\\frac1{50}$ of the side length away from the two sides it is closest to. By moving $X$ $\\frac s{50}$ to the right, we also move one ray from the right sector to the left sector, which determines another $100$-ray partitional point. We can continue moving $X$ right and up to derive the set of points that are $100$-ray partitional.\nIn the end, we get a square grid of points each $\\frac s{50}$ apart from one another. Since this grid ranges from a distance of $\\frac s{50}$ from one side to $\\frac{49s}{50}$ from the same side, we have a $49\\times49$ grid, a total of $2401$ $100$-ray partitional points. To find the overlap from the $60$-ray partitional, we must find the distance from the corner-most $60$-ray partitional point to the sides closest to it. Since the $100$-ray partitional points form a $49\\times49$ grid, each point $\\frac s{50}$ apart from each other, we can deduce that the $60$-ray partitional points form a $29\\times29$ grid, each point $\\frac s{30}$ apart from each other. To find the overlap points, we must find the common divisors of $30$ and $50$ which are $1, 2, 5,$ and $10$. Therefore, the overlapping points will form grids with points $s$, $\\frac s{2}$, $\\frac s{5}$, and $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other respectively. Since the grid with points $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other includes the other points, we can disregard the other grids. The total overlapping set of points is a $9\\times9$ grid, which has $81$ points. Subtract $81$ from $2401$ to get $2401-81=\\boxed{2320}$.",
