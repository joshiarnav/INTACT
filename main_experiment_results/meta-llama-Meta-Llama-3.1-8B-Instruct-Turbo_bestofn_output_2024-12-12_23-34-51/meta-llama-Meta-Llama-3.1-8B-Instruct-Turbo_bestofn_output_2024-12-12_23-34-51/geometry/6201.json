    "To find the area of the triangle, we need to use the Extended Law of Sines. \n\nStep 1: Recall the Extended Law of Sines. The Extended Law of Sines states that for any triangle with angle measures $A$, $B$, and $C$, and opposite side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively, we have:\n\n$\\frac{a}{\\sin(A)} = \\frac{b}{\\sin(B)} = \\frac{c}{\\sin(C)} = 2R$, \n\nwhere $R$ is the radius of the circumcircle.\n\nStep 2: Use the given arc lengths of $3$, $4$, and $5$ to find the central angles of the circle. Let the central angles be $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$, respectively. We have:\n\n$\\alpha = 3/r$, $\\beta = 4/r$, and $\\gamma = 5/r$, \n\nwhere $r$ is the radius of the circle.\n\nStep 3: Use the Extended Law of Sines to find the circumference of the circle and the radius.\n\nSince the circumference of the circle is equal to the sum of the lengths of the three arcs, we have:\n\n$2\\pi r = 3 + 4 + 5$\n\nThis implies that $2\\pi r = 12$, so $r = 6/\\pi$.\n\nStep 4: Use the Extended Law of Sines to express the side lengths of the triangle in terms of the radius of the circumcircle. Let the side lengths of the triangle be $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively. We have:\n\n$a = 2R \\sin(A)$, $b = 2R \\sin(B)$, and $c = 2R \\sin(C)$. \n\nSince the radius of the circumcircle is $6/\\pi$, we have:\n\n$a = 2(6/\\pi) \\sin(A)$, $b = 2(6/\\pi) \\sin(B)$, and $c = 2(6/\\pi) \\sin(C)$. \n\nStep 5: Simplify the expressions for the side lengths of the triangle. We can obtain $a$, $b$, and $c$ by taking the sine of their corresponding central angles.\n\nUsing the Extended Law of Sines and the above tables, we find the area of the triangle with the formula $K = \\frac{abc}{4R^2}$. It evaluates to $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{\\pi^2}(\\sqrt{3}+3)}$.",
    "To find the area of the triangle inscribed in the circle, we can use the extended law of sines. \n\nStep 1:  The problem gives us a circle with an inscribed triangle whose vertices divide the circle into three arcs of lengths 3, 4, and 5.\n\nStep 2:  To find the area of the triangle, we need to first find the radius of the circle. Let's denote the radius as \"r\".\n\nStep 3:  The circumference of the circle is the sum of the lengths of its three arcs. So, the circumference is 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.\n\nStep 4:  We can use the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is 2 * pi * r. Setting up the equation, we have 2 * pi * r = 12.\n\nStep 5:  Solving for \"r\", we get r = 12 / (2 * pi) = 6 / pi.\n\nStep 6:  Now that we have the radius, we can use the extended law of sines to relate the side lengths of the triangle to the radius of the circle.\n\nStep 7:  Let's define the angles of the triangle as A, B, and C, corresponding to the arcs of lengths 3, 4, and 5.\n\nStep 8:  Using the extended law of sines, we have the following relationships:\n   - a / sin(A) = 2 * r\n   - b / sin(B) = 2 * r\n   - c / sin(C) = 2 * r\n   where a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle.\n\nStep 9:  We can find the angles A, B, and C in terms of their arc lengths.\n\nStep 10:  The central angle (inscribed angle) relationship states that the central angle is equal to 2 times the inscribed angle.\n\nStep 11:  For arc lengths 3 and 2pi*r (radius Ol) we can use (3/(2pi*r))2pi*r = 3 giving us angle A = 3 / r = 3 / (6 / pi) = pi / 2.\n\nStep 12:  Similarly, for arc length 4 we can use (4/(2pi*r))2pi*r = 4 giving us angle B = 4 / 6 = 2 / 3 * pi.\n\nStep 13:  For arc length 5 we can use (5/(2pi*r))2pi*r = 5 giving us angle C = 5 / 6 * pi.\n\nStep 14:  We now have the side lengths and angles of the triangle in terms of \"r\".\n\nStep 15:  Let's find the side a using the extended law of sines, a / sin(A) = 2 * r, we have a = 2 * r * sin(A) = 2 * (6/ pi) * sin(pi/2) = 2 *  (6 / pi) * 1 = 12 / pi.\n\nStep 16:  Similarly, we can find the side b using the extended law of sines, b = 2 * r * sin(B) = 2 * (6 / pi) * sin(2 * pi / 3) = 2 * (6 / pi) * sqrt(3) / 2 = 6 / pi * sqrt(3).\n\nStep 17:  Finally, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, Area = (1/2) * base * height, or Area = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C).\n\nStep 18:  Substituting the values of a, b, and C in terms of \"r\", we get Area = (1/2) * (12/pi) * (6/pi * sqrt(3)) * sin(5 * pi / 6) = (36 * sqrt(3)) / (2 * pi^2) * (sqrt(3) - 1) / 2.\n\nStep 19:  Simplifying the expression, we get Area = (9 * (sqrt(3) - 1)) / (pi^2).\n\nStep 20:  Therefore, the area of the triangle is  (9 * (sqrt(3) - 1)) / (pi^2).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{\\pi^2}(\\sqrt{3}-1)}$",

  "solution": "The three arcs make up the entire circle, so the circumference of the circle is $3+4+5=12$ and the radius is $\\frac{12}{2\\pi}=\\frac{6}{\\pi}$. Also, the lengths of the arcs are proportional to their corresponding central angles. Thus, we can write the values of the arcs as $3\\theta$, $4\\theta$, and $5\\theta$ for some $\\theta$. By Circle Angle Sum, we obtain $3\\theta+4\\theta+5\\theta=360$. Solving yields $\\theta=30$. Thus, the angles of the triangle are $90$, $120$, and $150$.
