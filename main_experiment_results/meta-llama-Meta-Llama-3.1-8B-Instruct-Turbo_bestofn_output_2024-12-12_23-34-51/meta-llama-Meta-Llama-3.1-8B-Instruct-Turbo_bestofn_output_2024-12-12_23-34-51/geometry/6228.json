    "To solve this problem, let's consider the given information step by step:\n\n1. We have a triangle $\\triangle ABC$ where the ratio $AC:CB$ is $3:4$. \n\n2. The bisector of the exterior angle at $C$ intersects $BA$ extended at $P$ ($A$ is between $P$ and $B$).\n\nGiven that the bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side in the ratio of the adjacent sides is known as the angle bisector theorem, however, the angle bisector theorem doesn't work here because it is the exterior angle bisector.\n\nHowever, the exterior angle bisector theorem states that an exterior angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.\n\nTherefore, we have $\\frac{PA}{AB} = \\frac{AC}{CB}$.\n\nSince the ratio $AC:CB$ is $3:4$, we can substitute this into the equation from the exterior angle bisector theorem:\n\n$\\frac{PA}{AB} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio $PA:AB$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we can use some properties of triangles and the angle bisector theorem.\n\nStep 1: Let's recall the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that if an angle bisector intersects the opposite side, it divides the side proportionally to the adjacent sides.\n\nStep 2: In our case, we have the triangle $\\triangle ABC$ and the ratio $AC:CB = 3:4$. The angle bisector of the exterior angle at $C$ intersects $BA$ extended at $P$.\n\nStep 3: According to the Angle Bisector Theorem, we can say that the ratio $AC:CB$ is equal to the ratio $AD:DB$, where $D$ is the intersection point of the angle bisector and $BC$.\n\nStep 4: We know that $AC:CB = 3:4$, so we can say that $AD:DB = 3:4$. \n\nStep 5: Now, let's consider the point $A$. We have the ratio $PC:PD$ and we want to find the ratio $PA:AB$. \n\nStep 6: Since the ratio $PC:PD$ is the inverse of the ratio $AD:DB$, we can say that $PC:PD = 4:3$.\n\nStep 7: Now, let's look at the ratio $PA:PB$. We know that $PC$ is part of the line $PD$, so we can say that $PC = PB - PD$. \n\nStep 8: We can substitute $PC = PB - PD$ into the ratio $PC:PD = 4:3$ to get $(PB - PD):PD = 4:3$.\n\nStep 9: From the ratio $AD:DB = 3:4$, we have the ratio $AB:BD = 3:4$. \n\nStep 10: Therefore, we can substitute $AB = 3x$ and $BD = 4x$ into the equation $(PB - PD):PD = 4:3$.\n\nStep 11: Now we have the equation $(PB - PD):PD = (3x - 4x)/(4x - 3x)$ which simplifies to $-x:x = 4:3$.\n\nStep 12: We know that $PB = PD - x$ and $PA = PB + AB$, so we can substitute $PB = PD - x$ and $AB = 3x$ into the ratio $PA:PB = 3:1$.\n\nStep 13: This gives us $PA:PD - x = 3:1$.\n\nStep 14: Therefore, we can set up the equation $PA:PD = 3:1 + x = 7:1$.\n\nStep 15: Since we want the ratio $PA:AB$, we can substitute $PA = 7$ and $AB = 3x$ into the ratio $PA:AB$.\n\nStep 16: This gives us the ratio $PA:AB = 7:(3x)$.

    "To solve this problem, we can use similar triangles and the Angle Bisector Theorem.\n\nSince the ratio $AC:CB$ is $3:4$, we can use this to find the ratio $AB:BC$. We can use the fact that the ratio of the sides opposite the angles is equal to the ratio of the angles. In this case, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{AC}{CB} = 3:4$$\n\nThis gives us:\n\n$$\\frac{AB + AC}{AC} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{AB}{AC} + 1 = \\frac{4}{3}$$\n\nThis gives us:\n\n$$\\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nSince $AB = AC + CB$, we can substitute this into the above equation to get:\n\n$$\\frac{AC + CB}{AC} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nThis gives us:\n\n$$1 + \\frac{CB}{AC} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{CB}{AC} = -\\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nSince we know that $\\frac{AC}{CB} = 3:4$, we can cross-multiply to get:\n\n$$AC = 3x$$\n$$CB = 4x$$\n\nwhere $x$ is some positive real number. \n\n Let's find the length of $AB$. \n\nSince $AB = AC + CB$, we can substitute the above expressions to get:\n\n$$AB = 3x + 4x = 7x$$\n\nSince $AC = 3x$, we can find $\\frac{AB}{AC}$ as follows:\n\n$$\\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{7x}{3x} = \\frac{7}{3}$$\n\nThe angle bisector theorem tells us that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments into which the angle bisector divides the side opposite to it (here with $BA$) is equal to the ratio of the other two sides. However since we didn't specifically know that it was specifically this segment, we use what we know to proceed. Note that $\\triangle ABP$ is similar to $\\triangle APB$, Let\u2019s call the length of the segment from $P$ to $A$ as $x$. Note that, from the fact that $AB = AP + PB$,  with $PB = 7x$ (as calculated from previous, or shown it's equivalent to it mathematically)  and  $x$ as the length of $AP$. So that gives us\n\n$$AP:PB $$ \n\nWhich is \n\n$$x:(7x- x)$$\n\nSimplifying that we get\n\n$$x:6x$$\n\nWhich gives us \n\n$$\\frac{x}{6x}=\\frac{1}{6}$$\n\nWe are given in this question, that the ratio $AC:CB$ is $3:4$. So since $x=(PB-AB)$ \n\n$$AP=(x-PB)$$\n\nSo let's determine the ratio of the segments $AP:PB$. We can then substitute $x$ with a suitable value to determine the length of the sides in terms of the given ratio. Given Let\u2019s find the suitable  with value Let\u2019s find with Let\u2019s we with Given that with Let\u2019s  to Given Given with Given Let\u2019s suitable that Given with $$ Let's use what we know to substitute the value of $AB$, $PB$ and $AP$. and check given Finally we get that Let\u2019s find with Given Let\u2019s we to Given Given $$ \n\nSince $AP = x$ and $PB = 7x - x$ we can use this to find the ratio $AP:PB$ as follows:\n\n$$AP:PB = x:(7x-x)$$\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n$$AP:PB = x:6x$$\n\nThis gives us:\n\n$$\\frac{AP}{PB} = \\frac{1}{6}$$\n\nWe need to find the ratio $PA:AB$. Since $PA = PB - AB$, we can use this to find the ratio $PA:AB$ as follows:\n\n$$PA:AB = (PB-AB):AB$$\n\nUsing the fact that $AB = AC + CB$ and substituting the values of $AB$, $PB$ and $AC$, we get:\n\n$$PA:AB = (7x-3x-x):7x$$ \n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n$$PA:AB = (4x-5x):7x$$\n\nThis gives us:\n\n$$PA:AB = -x:7x$$ $$ \n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n$$PA:AB = \\frac{-x}{7x}$$\n\n Let\u2019s multiply both sides of $$ \n\n$$PA:AB = \\frac{-1}{7}$$"
