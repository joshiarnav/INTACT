    "To find the length of one side of the equilateral triangle, we'll first sketch the graph of the function $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$ and label the points $A, B,$ and $O.$\n\nThen, we label the vertices of triangle $ABO$ and show the altitude $AX$ to segment $\\overline{BO},$ where $X$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BO}.$\n\nBy considering the relationships between the points $A, X, O,$ and $B,$ we can find an expression for the coordinates of point $A.$\n\nLet $A$ be the point $(a,-\\frac{1}{2}a^2).$ Since $AX$ is the altitude of $\\triangle ABX,$ we can consider that $AX^2 + BX^2 = AB^2.$\n\nFor $X$ to be the midpoint of segment $\\overline{BO},$ we can consider that point $O$ at $(0,0)$ and point $B$ at $(-3.4641, -6)$.\n\nSo, $a = 3.4641.$ \n\nWe will now use the pythagorean theorem to find the length of segment $\\overline{AX}.$\n\nThe distance from point $O$ to $X$ nor the distance from $B$ to $X$ is needed to find the length of $AX$; instead consider this as a way to find $AX$. \n\n$AB^2$ is the square of distance from $A$ to $X,$ via $a^2 + (\\frac{1}{2}a^2 + 6)^2$\n\nTherefore, we're considering this:\n$a^2 + (\\frac{1}{2}a^2 + 6)^2 = AB^2$\n\nThe algebraic treatment is:\n$ a^2 + \\frac{1}{4}a^4 + 12a^2 + 36 = AB^2$\n\nSince we know $a = 3.4641,$ then this equation will have the following algebraic results:\n$(3.4641)^2 + \\frac{1}{4}(3.4641)^4 + 12(3.4641)^2 +36 = AB^2$\n \n$ AB^2 = 12 + \\frac{1}{4}(3.4641)^2(3.4641)^2 + 12(3.4641)^2 +36$\nAnd the next one is $ AB^2 = 12(1 + (3.4641)^2 ) +36 + \\frac{1}{4}(3.4641)^4$\nWe will keep on computing:\n$AB^2 = 12(12) +36 + (12 + 36 + (3.4641)^2 + (12 + 36 + (3.4641)^2)(3.4641)^2)/4$\nand so on, considering computing through all, we'll get $AB^2=48 + 12 + (3.4641)^2$\n\n$AB^2= 60 + (12 + 3.4641)^2/4$ and finally computing:\n$ AB^2=60 + 12(3.4641) + 12(3.4641)^2/4 + (3.4641)^4/4 $\n\nBy doing all calculations: \n\n$AB^2= 60 + 41.6592/4 + 12(1.4641) + (3.4641)^4/4$\n\n$AB^2=60 + 10.4198 + 17.5709 + 3.8286 = 91.619$\n\n$\\sqrt{AB^2}=  AB = \\sqrt{91.619}$\n\n$ AB = 9.57$ [$\\sqrt{91.6204647} = 9.56502038605$]\n\nOur result for $AB$ is approximately $AB$ $\\approx$ 9.57.\n\n$\\boxed{9.6}$",
    "To find the length of one side of triangle $ABO,$ we need to find the distance between points $A$ and $B.$\n\nSince $\\triangle ABO$ is equilateral, the distance between points $A$ and $B$ is the same as the distance between points $A$ and $O,$ which is the same as the altitude of the triangle, because an altitude in an equilateral triangle splits the triangle into two congruent 30-60-90 triangles.\n\nWe can use the equation $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$ to find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Let's assume the coordinates of point $A$ are $(x_A,y_A)$. We know that the point is on the graph of the equation, so we have $y_A = -\\frac{1}{2}x_A^2$. \n\nSince the triangle is equilateral and point $O$ is at the origin, the coordinates of point $A$ will be of the form $(a, -b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive. We also know that $y_O = y_A = -b$ from the equation $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$. \n\nTherefore the equation becomes $-b = -\\frac{1}{2} a^2$.\n\nNow we need to find the length of the side of the equilateral triangle, which is $OB$ (or $OA$). We know that an altitude in an equilateral triangle consists of 30-60-90 triangles. If we use point $A$ and the altitude of point $B$ to create a triangle, we get a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse of length $OA$. The sides of this 30-60-90 triangle are $a$ and $b$, and the hypotenuse is $OA$.\n\nWe also know that for a 30-60-90 triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the length of the longer leg is the length of the hypotenuse times the square root of 3.\n\nLet $d$ be the distance from point $B$ to the origin, $O$. We have $d = \\frac{(a+b)}{\\sqrt{3}}$ for a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse of length $d$ and legs of length $OB$ and $AB$.\n\nUsing the relationship $OA = AB$ (in an equilateral triangle each side equals the other sides), we can write $OA = d$.\n\nGiven the relationship $d= \\frac{(a+b)}{\\sqrt{3}}$ for an equilateral triangle, we know that\n$a + b = d \\sqrt{3}$, and also that $d = \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nNow we know that, $b = -d \\sqrt{3}$ from the equation of the parabola.\n\nSince $d = \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{3}}$, we have that $d = \\frac{-d \\sqrt{3} \\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{-3d}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nSolving for $d$ gives us $d = \\frac{-3d}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{-3}$ so $d = \\frac{d}{3} \\times 3$ thus $d = d$. This isn't solving the equation for d, we are just verifying the expression of d.\n\nNow we need to solve for $d$ in terms of $a$, this means we need to find the relationship between $d$ and $a$. We know that $a = \\frac{-b}{\\sqrt{3}}$, because in a 30-60-90 triangle the length of the shorter leg (the side nearest to the right angle) is the length of the hypotenuse times the square root of 3 times the cosine of 30 degrees, this value is $a = \\frac{(a+b)}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting $b = -d \\sqrt{3}$, we have that $a = \\frac{(a + -d \\sqrt{3})}{2}$.\n\nSolving for a, we get $2a = a - d \\sqrt{3}$ which simplifies to $a = - d \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nNow we can substitute for a in terms of d, and solve the equation $d = \\frac{a+b}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nSo $d = \\frac{a + (-d \\sqrt{3})}{\\sqrt{3}}$, we can substitute $a = -d \\sqrt{3}$, we get $d = \\frac{ -d \\sqrt{3} + (-d \\sqrt{3})}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nSolving the equation gives us $d = \\frac{-2d \\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nThe $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$ can be canceled out from the top and bottom of the fraction because they are the same, this leaves us with $d = -2d$.\n\nSolving the equation $d = -2d$ gives us $d = 2d$ and subtracting $2d$ from both sides gives us $d = 0$.\n\nHowever, this isn't the correct solution, because if we substitute $d = 0$ back in the equation $a = -d \\sqrt{3}$ we would get $a = 0$ and the relationship $OA = AB$ (in an equilateral triangle each side equals the other sides) would not hold.\n\nTherefore, if we know that, $a + b = d \\sqrt{3}$, and also that $d = \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{3}}$ and the relationship $b = -d \\sqrt{3}$, then we can say that\n\n$d \\sqrt{3} = (a + (-d \\sqrt{3}))$\n\nWe can factor out the $d \\sqrt{3}$ from the right hand side of the equation.\n\n$(d \\sqrt{3}) + a = -d \\sqrt{3} + a$ (this is just to make it look more complicated)\n\nWe know that we can cancel the $a$'s from both sides, because they are the same, this leaves us with $d \\sqrt{3} = -d \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThis equation is the same as $2d \\sqrt{3} = 0$.\n\nSo finally we get $2d \\sqrt{3} = 0$, which gives us that $\\boxed{d = 0}$ or $\\boxed{d = -\\infty}$ you can't have a negative $\\infty$, because this isn't a valid answer, we must express our answer as a positive value, therefore we can say that the distance from the point $B$ to the origin, $O$ is $d = 0$, however this wasn't our final answer, our final answer is the length of one side of triangle $ABO$.\n\nTo find the value of $d$ we can set $d \\sqrt{3}$ equal to $3b$ or $3b = a + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers.\n\nSo we have $3b = a + b$ which simplifies to $3b - b = a$, thus $2b = a$.\n\nWe know that $b = -d \\sqrt{3}$, we can substitute for $b$, this gives us $2(-d \\sqrt{3}) = a$.\n\nSolving for $a$ we get $a = -2d \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nWe can also substitute $b$ in the equation $3b = a + b$, this gives us $3(-d \\sqrt{3}) = a + (-d \\sqrt{3})$ which simplifies to $3(-d \\sqrt{3}) = a -d \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nSolving for $a$ gives us $a = 2d \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThis proves that we don't know, $a$, so let's try a different approach.\n\nIn terms of a right triangle, we can say that, the side $OA$ and the side $AB$ are the same, and the side $OB$ is the altitude of the triangle.\n\nIn a right triangle, the altitude is the longer leg, and the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg.\n\nIf we use the point $A$ and the altitude of point $B$, we get a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse of length $OA$. Let's denote the hypotenuse as $c$ and the shorter leg (the side nearest to the right angle) as $a$.\n\nFor a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse of length $c$ and shorter leg of length $a$, we have that, $c = 2a$ and $a = \\frac{c \\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\n\nNow we have that $c = 2a$ and $a = \\frac{c \\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\n\nWe can equate the two equations for $a$ and solve for $c$. So $\\frac{c \\sqrt{3}}{3} = a$ and $c = 2a$.\n\nSubstituting for a, we have that $\\frac{c \\sqrt{3}}{3} = a$ is equivalent to $\\frac{c \\sqrt{3}}{3",
    "To find the length of one side of triangle $ABO$, let's denote the length of $AB$ as $s$. Since triangle $ABO$ is equilateral, we know that $OA = s$ and $OB = s$.\n\nFirst, we need to find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.  We know that $A$ and $B$ lie on the graph of the equation $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$. So, the $y$-coordinate of $A$ and $B$ is given by the equation $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$. \n\nLet's denote the $x$-coordinate of $A$ as $x_A$ and the $y$-coordinate of $A$ as $y_A$.

If we use point $A$ and the altitude of point $B$ to create a triangle, we get a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse of length $OA$. The sides of this 30-60-90 triangle are $a$ and $b$, and the hypotenuse is $OA$.\n\nWe also know that for a 30-60-90 triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the length of the longer leg is the length of the hypotenuse times the square root of 3.\n\nLet $d$ be the distance from point $B$ to the origin, $O$. We have $d = \\frac{(a+b)}{\\sqrt{3}}$ for a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse of length $d$ and legs of length $OB$ and $AB$.\n\nUsing the relationship $OA = AB$ (in an equilateral triangle each side equals the other sides), we can write $OA = d$.\n\nGiven the relationship $d= \\frac{(a+b)}{\\sqrt{3}}$ for an equilateral triangle, we know that\n$a + b = d \\sqrt{3}$, and also that $d = \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nNow we know that, $b = -d \\sqrt{3}$ from the equation of the parabola.\n\nSince $d = \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{3}}$, we have that $d = \\frac{-d \\sqrt{3} \\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{-3d}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nSolving for $d$ gives us $d = \\frac{-3d}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{-3}$ so $d = \\frac{d}{3} \\times 3$ thus $d = d$. This isn't solving the equation for d, we are just verifying the expression of d.\n\nNow we need to solve for $d$ in terms of $a$, this means we need to find the relationship between $d$ and $a$. We know that $a = \\frac{-b}{\\sqrt{3}}$, because in a 30-60-90 triangle the length of the shorter leg (the side nearest to the right angle) is the length of the hypotenuse times the square root of 3 times the cosine of 30 degrees, this value is $a = \\frac{(a+b)}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting $b = -d \\sqrt{3}$, we have that $a = \\frac{(a + -d \\sqrt{3})}{2}$.\n\nSolving for a, we get $2a = a - d \\sqrt{3}$ which simplifies to $a = - d \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nNow we can substitute for a in terms of d, and solve the equation $d = \\frac{a+b}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nSo $d = \\frac{a + (-d \\sqrt{3})}{\\sqrt{3}}$, we can substitute $a = -d \\sqrt{3}$, we get $d = \\frac{ -d \\sqrt{3} + (-d \\sqrt{3})}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nSolving the equation gives us $d = \\frac{-2d \\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nThe $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$ can be canceled out from the top and bottom of the fraction because they are the same, this leaves us with $d = -2d$.\n\nSolving the equation $d = -2d$ gives us $d = 2d$ and subtracting $2d$ from both sides gives us $d = 0$.\n\nHowever, this isn't the correct solution, because if we substitute $d = 0$ back in the equation $a = -d \\sqrt{3}$ we would get $a = 0$ and the relationship $OA = AB$ (in an equilateral triangle each side equals the other sides) would not hold.\n\nTherefore, if we know that, $a + b = d \\sqrt{3}$, and also that $d = \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{3}}$ and the relationship $b = -d \\sqrt{3}$, then we can say that\n\n$d \\sqrt{3} = (a + (-d \\sqrt{3}))$\n\nWe can factor out the $d \\sqrt{3}$ from the right hand side of the equation.\n\n$(d \\sqrt{3}) + a = -d \\sqrt{3} + a$ (this is just to make it look more complicated)\n\nWe know that we can cancel the $a$'s from both sides, because they are the same, this leaves us with $d \\sqrt{3} = -d \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThis equation is the same as $2d \\sqrt{3} = 0$.\n\nSo finally we get $2d \\sqrt{3} = 0$, which gives us that $\\boxed{d = 0}$ or $\\boxed{d = -\\infty}$ you can't have a negative $\\infty$, because this isn't a valid answer, we must express our answer as a positive value, therefore we can say that the distance from the point $B$ to the origin, $O$ is $d = 0$, however this wasn't our final answer, our final answer is the length of one side of triangle $ABO$.\n\nTo find the value of $d$ we can set $d \\sqrt{3}$ equal to $3b$ or $3b = a + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers.\n\nSo we have $3b = a + b$ which simplifies to $3b - b = a$, thus $2b = a$.\n\nWe know that $b = -d \\sqrt{3}$, we can substitute for $b$, this gives us $2(-d \\sqrt{3}) = a$.\n\nSolving for $a$ we get $a = -2d \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nWe can also substitute $b$ in the equation $3b = a + b$, this gives us $3(-d \\sqrt{3}) = a + (-d \\sqrt{3})$ which simplifies to $3(-d \\sqrt{3}) = a -d \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nSolving for $a$ gives us $a = 2d \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThis proves that we don't know, $a$, so let's try a different approach.\n\nIn terms of a right triangle, we can say that, the side $OA$ and the side $AB$ are the same, and the side $OB$ is the altitude of the triangle.\n\nIn a right triangle, the altitude is the longer leg, and the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg.\n\nIf we use the point $A$ and the altitude of point $B$, we get a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse of length $OA$. Let's denote the hypotenuse as $c$ and the shorter leg (the side nearest to the right angle) as $a$.\n\nFor a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse of length $c$ and shorter leg of length $a$, we have that, $c = 2a$ and $a = \\frac{c \\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\n\nNow we have that $c = 2a$ and $a = \\frac{c \\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\n\nWe can equate the two equations for $a$ and solve for $c$. So $\\frac{c \\sqrt{3}}{3} = a$ and $c = 2a$.\n\nSubstituting for a, we have that $\\frac{c \\sqrt{3}}{3} = a$ is equivalent to $\\frac{c \\sqrt{3}}{3}$",
  "critique": "After analyzing each solution for correctness, I would select solution 3 as the best solution. \n\nSolution 3 is the most straightforward and clear solution.

  "solution": "Let the coordinates of $A$ be $(a_1,a_2)$. Then since $A$ is on the graph of $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, we know that $a_2 = -\\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$. We can also use our knowledge of special right triangles to write $a_2$ in terms of $a_1$. Let $C$ be the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ and let $O$ be the origin. Then $OCA$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, so the ratio of the length of $OC$ to the length of $CA$ is $\\sqrt{3}:1$. Now the coordinates of C are $(0, a_2)$, so the length of $OC$ is just $-a_2$ (since $a_2$ is negative) and the length of $CA$ is $a_1$. This means $\\dfrac{-a_2}{a_1}=\\sqrt{3} \\Longrightarrow a_2=-\\sqrt{3}a_1$.\n\nWe can now set our two equations for $a_2$ equal to each other and get $-\\sqrt{3}a_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$. Multiplying both sides by $-\\frac{2}{a_1}$ immediately gives $a_1=2\\sqrt{3}$. From here we could solve for $a_2$ using one of our equations and then use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the side length of the equilateral triangle, but there's a better way. We remember that the hypotenuse of our special triangle is twice as long as the shortest side of it, which has length $a_1=2\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore our answer is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$.",
