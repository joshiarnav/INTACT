    "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of the circumference of a circle and the measure of a central angle.\n\nThe formula for the circumference of a circle is:\n\nCircumference = $2 \\pi r$\n\nwhere $r$ is the radius of the circle.\n\nThe measure of a central angle is given by:\n\n$\\theta = \\frac{\\text{arc length}}{\\text{radius}}$\n\nLet's find the radius of circle $A$. We are given that the circumference of circle $A$ is 60 feet. We can use the formula for the circumference of a circle to find the radius:\n\n$60 = 2 \\pi r$\n\nNow, we need to find the measure of the arc $\\widehat{BC}$. We know that the central angle formed by arc $\\widehat{BC}$ is $60^{\\circ}$. However, we can use this information to find the measure of the entire circle. \n\nThe entire circle has a central angle of $360^{\\circ}$. We can use the proportion below to find the length of arc $\\widehat{BC}$:\n\n$ \\frac{60^{\\circ}}{360^{\\circ}} = \\frac{\\text{arc length}}{60}$\n\nSolving for the arc length, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 60 = 10$ feet.\n\nTherefore, the length of $\\widehat{BC}$ is $\\boxed{10}$ feet.",

    "To solve this problem, we will use the properties of a circle and the concept of a central angle.\n\nStep 1: Identify the properties of a circle.\n- The circumference of a circle is the distance around the circle. It is calculated as $C = 2 \\pi r$, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n- A central angle is an angle formed by two radii of a circle that intersect at the center of the circle.\n\nStep 2: Understand the given problem.\n- We are given the circumference of circle A as 60 feet.\n- We are asked to find the length of arc $\\widehat{BC}$, which is formed by a 60-degree central angle.\n\nStep 3: Find the radius of the circle.\n- To find the radius, we will use the formula for the circumference: $C = 2 \\pi r$\n- We know that the circumference is 60 feet, so we can rewrite the equation as $60 = 2 \\pi r$\n- To solve for r, we divide both sides by 2\u03c0: $r = \\frac{60}{2 \\pi}$\n- Now, we can simplify this expression to find the value of r: $r = \\frac{30}{\\pi}$\n\nStep 4: Find the length of the arc.\n- The length of an arc is directly proportional to the measure of the central angle that it subtends. This means that if we know the circumference of the circle and the measure of the central angle, we can find the length of the arc.\n- In this problem, the central angle is 60 degrees, and the circumference of the circle is 60 feet. To find the length of the arc, we will use the proportion: $\\frac{\\text{arc length}}{\\text{circumference}} = \\frac{\\text{central angle}}{360^{\\circ}}$\n- Now, we can rewrite this proportion as: $\\text{arc length} = \\frac{60^{\\circ}}{360^{\\circ}} \\cdot 60$\n- Now, we can simplify this expression to find the length of the arc: $\\text{arc length} = \\frac{60^{\\circ}}{360^{\\circ}} \\cdot 60$\n- Arc length is now equal to $10$.\n\nSo the answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
