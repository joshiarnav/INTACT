    "To find the length of $BD$, we can utilize the properties of similar triangles and right triangle $ABC$. First, since $\\angle C=90^\\circ$, triangle $ABC$ is a right-angled triangle. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can calculate the length of side $AB$: \n\n$AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100.$\n\nTherefore, $AB = \\sqrt{100} = 10.$\n\nNext, let's focus on right triangle $BED.$ Since $\\angle BED = 90^\\circ$, it follows that the ratio of corresponding sides in triangle $DEB$ will be the same as in triangle $ABC.$ To find this ratio, we need to determine the length of $BE.$ Using similarity, we have:\n\n$\\dfrac{BD}{BA} = \\dfrac{ED}{EA}$.\n\nWe can use this ratio along with the similarity of the triangles to find $DE$ in terms of the length of $ED$ and the ratio, $BD/BA$, in terms of $BD/AB$ since $DE/EA = ED/EA$. Then to find the value of BD.\n\nTo start, let's express $BD/BA$ in terms of $DE/ED$: \n\n$\\dfrac{BD}{10} = \\dfrac{4}{6}$, and so we have $\\dfrac{BD}{BA} = \\dfrac{DE}{EA} = \\dfrac{4}{6}$, and to find $BA$, noting $AC = 6, BC=8, k^2=100.$\n\n$\\because \\frac{BD}{10}=\\frac{4}{6} \\Rightarrow BD = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 10$, so $BD = \\boxed{20/3}$."
