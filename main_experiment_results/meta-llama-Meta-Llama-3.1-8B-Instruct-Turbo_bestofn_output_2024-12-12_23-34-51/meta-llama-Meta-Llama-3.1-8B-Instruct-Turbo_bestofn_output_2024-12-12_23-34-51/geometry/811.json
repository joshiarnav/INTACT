    "To find the measure of $\\angle RPQ$, we first need to calculate the measure of $\\angle RSQ$. Let's denote the measure of $\\angle RSQ$ as $a = 2y^\\circ$.\n\nSince $PQ=PR$, triangles $\\triangle RQP$ and $\\triangle PQR$ are isosceles, and since $QP$ bisects $\\angle SQR$, triangles $\\triangle RQS$ and $\\triangle PQR$ are also isosceles.\n\nAs a result, we get $a = 2y^\\circ = \\angle RSQ$, and $x = \\frac{a}{2} = y^\\circ$.\n\nBut, we also know that $x = \\frac{a}{2} = \\frac{2y}{2}= y$. \n\nSo we have $x=y$.\n\nAlso note that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always $180^\\circ$. Using this fact, we can write the sum of the angles of $\\triangle PQR$: \\begin{align*}\n\\left(\\frac{\\angle RPQ}{1}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{\\angle RQP}{1}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{\\angle PRQ}{1}\\right)&=\\frac{180}{1}^\\circ\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\ \\ \\ \\left(\\frac{3y^\\circ}{1}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{y^\\circ}{1}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{y^\\circ}{1}\\right)&=\\frac{180}{1}^\\circ\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\ \\ \\  5y& = 180\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ y &= \\frac{180}{5}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\ \\ \\ y &= \\boxed{36^\\circ}\n\\end{align*}Substituting $y = 36^\\circ$ into $3y^\\circ$ gives us $3 \\cdot 36^\\circ = \\boxed{108^\\circ}$.\nTherefore,  $\\angle RPQ=108^\\circ$.\n\n$\\boxed{108}$",
    "Since $QP$ bisects $\\angle SQR$, we have that $\\angle PQS = \\angle PQR = x.$ \n\nBecause $PQ=PR$ and $\\triangle PQR$ is isosceles, it follows that $\\angle PRQ = \\angle PQR = x.$ \n\nThen, $\\angle PQS + \\angle PQR + \\angle RQS = 180^\\circ$.

    "To solve this problem, let's first understand the given diagram and the information we have.\n\n1. $QP$ bisects $\\angle SQR$, meaning it divides the angle into two equal parts, so $\\angle PQS=\\angle PQR=x^\\circ$.\n2. $\\angle RSQ=2y^\\circ$\n3. $\\angle RPQ=3y^\\circ$\n\nNow, let's analyze the angles in $\\triangle PQR$.\n\n- Since $PQ=PR$, $\\triangle PQR$ is an isosceles triangle.\n- In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are congruent, so we have $\\angle PQR=\\angle QRP=x^\\circ$.\n\nSince the three angles in $\\triangle PQR$ must sum to $180^\\circ$, we have\n\n$$x+x+3y=180.$$\n\nNow, let's look at $\\triangle RSQ$. We know that $\\angle RSQ=2y^\\circ$ and $\\angle PSQ=180^\\circ - (2y + x)^\\circ$ because the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always $180^\\circ$.\n\nBut since $RS=QP$ (because $P$ is on $RS$), and $PQ=RP$, by SAS (side-angle-side) postulate, $\\triangle RPS\\cong\\triangle QPR$ by the hypotenuse and two congruent sides. This means that $\\angle PRS=\\angle PQR=x^\\circ$. Now $\\angle PSR=180^\\circ-(3y+x)^\\circ$ (same reasoning as before).\n\nSince we also know that $\\angle PSR=180^\\circ - \\angle PSQ$,\n\n$$180^\\circ - \\angle PSQ=180^\\circ - (2y+x)^\\circ\\Rightarrow \\angle PSQ=2y+x^\\circ.$$\n\nSince we also know that $\\angle RSQ=2y^\\circ$, and we know that the three angles of a triangle sum to 180, we have\n\n$$2y+(2y+x)+(x)=(\\angle PSR)+(\\angle RSQ)+(\\angle QSR)=180^\\circ.$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we find that $x=36$. We know that $\\angle RPQ = 3y^\\circ$. We are given a linear relationship between $3y$ and $x$ with the previous derived equation for interior angles of triangle $PQR$. \n\nUsing the equation from the first paragraph $x+x+3y=180$, we have that \n$$2x+3y=180$$. To find the value of $y$ by ourselves from the initial information and replace it in the previous derived equation we get \n\n$$2x+3y=180$$\n$$2\\cdot 36+3y=180$$\n$36\\cdot 2+3y=180$\n$72+3y=180$\n$3y=180-72$\n$3y=108$\n$y=36$\n\nSince $\\angle RPQ=3y^\\circ$, we have $\\angle RPQ = 3 \\cdot 36^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{108}$"
