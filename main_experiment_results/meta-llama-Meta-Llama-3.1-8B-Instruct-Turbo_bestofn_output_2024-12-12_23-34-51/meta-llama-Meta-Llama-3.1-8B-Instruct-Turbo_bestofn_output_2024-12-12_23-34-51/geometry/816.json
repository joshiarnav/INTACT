    "To solve this problem, let's first break down the situation and define some variables.\n\nLet $x$ be the distance from point $A$ to its original position. \n\nWhen the square is folded, the black area is a triangle with base $x$ and height $x$ since the diagonal of the square has been divided into two equal parts. The area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}x^2$. \n\nThe white area left visible is the square with side length $x\\sqrt{2}$ (since the diagonal of a square with side length $a$ is $a\\sqrt{2}$) minus the area of an isosceles right triangle with leg length $x$, which is $\\frac{1}{2}x^2$. \n\nTherefore, the area of the visible white region is $x^2-x^2/2 = x^2/2$.\n\nSince the problem states that the black area is equal to the white area, we have $\\frac{1}{2}x^2 = \\frac{1}{2}x^2$. However, this seems a bit straightforward - it gives no variable as it stands so we must go back and take all our properties - generic units given were at $6 \\text{ cm}^2$. \n\nIf the area of the sheet is $6 \\text{ cm}^2$, then the side length of the square sheet is $\\sqrt{6} \\text{ cm}$.\n\nNow, imagine cutting along the diagonal of the square. Each half has an area of $3 \\text{ cm}^2$. When the sheet is folded, the black triangle formed by the cut has a height equal to the side length of the square minus $x$, or $\\sqrt{6}-x$, and a base also equal to $\\sqrt{6}-x$. \n\nSince the area of the black triangle is equal to that of the white triangle, which should be a properties of our formula generic given no known 'A' value variable has been. These equate to each other giving us\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{6}-x)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}x^2.$$",
    "To solve this problem, we need to find the distance of point $A$ from its original position. \n\n1. The area of the square is given as $6 \\text{ cm}^2$. Let's denote the length of one side of the square as $s$. We can find $s$ by taking the square root of the area.\n\n$s^2 = 6$\n$s = \\sqrt{6}$\n\n2. When the sheet is folded so that point $A$ rests on the diagonal, the visible black area is equal to the visible white area. This implies that the area of the two right-angled triangles formed by the fold is equal.\n\nLet $x$ be the distance from point $A$ to its original position. We can see that the two triangles are congruent, with each leg having a length of $\\sqrt{6}$ and one leg being the distance $x$.\n\n3. The area of one triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. Here, the base is $x$ and the height is $\\sqrt{6}$. So the area of one triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times x \\times \\sqrt{6}$.\n\n4. We have two triangles, so the total black area is $2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times x \\times \\sqrt{6} = x\\sqrt{6}$.\n\n5. The area of the white part is the area of the square minus the area of the black part. This is $(\\sqrt{6})^2 - x\\sqrt{6} = 6 - x\\sqrt{6}$.\n\n6. Since the visible black area is equal to the visible white area, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n$x\\sqrt{6} = 6 - x\\sqrt{6}$\n\n7. We can rearrange the equation to isolate $x$:\n\n$x\\sqrt{6} + x\\sqrt{6} = 6$\n$2x\\sqrt{6} = 6$\n$x\\sqrt{6} = 3$\n$x = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{6}}$\n\n8. We can rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{6}$:\n\n$x = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{6}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{6}}$\n$x = \\frac{3\\sqrt{6}}{6}$\n$x = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2}$\n\nSo the distance of point $A$ from its original position is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2}}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Given Information**: \n   - The area of the square is $6 \\text{ cm}^2$.\n   - The front of the sheet is white and the back is black.\n   - When the sheet is folded such that point $A$ rests on the diagonal, the visible black area is equal to the visible white area.\n\n2. **Determine the Side Length**: \n   - The area of the square is $6 \\text{ cm}^2$, and the formula for the area of a square is $A = s^2$ where $s$ is the side length.\n   - Solving the equation $6 = s^2$ for $s$ gives us $s = \\sqrt{6}$ centimeters.\n\n3. **Identify the Triangle**: \n   - When the sheet is folded, the diagonal becomes a line connecting $A$ to the midpoint of a side of the original square. This line divides the square into two congruent right-angled triangles, with the line being one of the sides of each triangle and the other side of each triangle being a side of the original square.\n   - Each of these triangles has a side length of $\\sqrt{6}$ cm.\n\n4. **Triangle Properties and Side Lengths**:\n   - The black area seen when the sheet is folded is the area of the triangle with the hypotenuse as part of the crease (along which the sheet is folded).\n   - If $x$ is the length of the crease and the hypotenuse is $y$, then the black area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{x}{2} \\cdot s = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{4}x$, as the hypotenuse divides the right angle of the strip into two equal angles. This is due to the property that when a transversal intersects two parallel lines, the alternate interior angles are congruent.\n   - Similarly, the visible white area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{y}{2} \\cdot s = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{4}y$. Here, the hypotenuse divides the white angle into two equal angles for the white side.\n\n5. **Setup of the Black and White Area Equality**:\n   - The area of the black triangle is equal to the area of the white triangle ($\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{4}x = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{4}y$).\n   - Solving this equality equation for $y$ in terms of $x$ gives us $y = x$.\n\n6. **Determining the Distance Using Pythagorean Theorem**:\n   - From point $A$ to the midpoint of the crease line $x$, the distance is the side length of the square, $\\sqrt{6}$.\n   - Also from point $A$ to the point of intersection of the hypotenuse with the fixed side of the square, forms a right angle triangle with fixed side length $\\sqrt{6}$ and hypotenuse length $y = \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{6})^2 + (\\sqrt{6})^2}$.\n   - Solving for distance $A$ to the point of intersection, will give us $A$ distance from its original position.\n\n7. **Calculating the Final Distance**:\n   - Using the Pythagorean Theorem for solving for $y$, and to find the distance $A$ is from its original position, we can substitute in the side lengths:\n\n$y^2 = (\\sqrt{6})^2 + (\\sqrt{6})^2 = 6 + 6 = 12$\n\nTaking the square root on both sides we get:\n\n$y = \\sqrt{12}$ \n\nWhen we factor the square root and simplify, we obtain: \n\n$y = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{3}}$ \n\nHowever, it is asked that the answer be in the format $\\boxed{answer}$ . Therefore changing formatting to include requested information."
