    "To find the greatest and least possible integral values of $x$, we need to consider the constraints of the triangle.\n\nThe given triangle has side lengths 5, 6, and $x$.

    "To find the positive difference between the greatest and least possible integral values of $x$, we can start by using the triangle inequality, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nIn this case, let's consider the triangle with sides of length 6, 5, and $x$. The triangle inequality gives us two inequalities:\n\n- $6 + 5 > x$ (which simplifies to $11 > x$)\n- $x + 5 > 6$ (which simplifies to $x > 1$)\n\nWe can see that $x$ must be greater than 1 and less than 11. Since $x$ is an integral value, the least possible integral value of $x$ is 2.\n\nSimilarly, we can use the triangle inequality to find the upper bound for $x$. This gives us:\n\n- $6 + x > 5$ (which simplifies to $x > -1$)\n\nSince $x$ is greater than 1 and -1 is less than all the values of $x$ we found, this inequality is verified. On the other hand, we have another inequality:\n\n- $x + 5 > 6$ (which simplifies to $x > 1$)\n\nWe can see that $x$ must be greater than 1 and less than 11. As $x$ is an integral value, the greatest possible integral value of $x$ is 10.\n\nThe positive difference between the greatest and least possible integral values of $x$ is $10 - 2 = \\boxed{8}$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. However, Solution 1 is the most clear and concise. It directly applies the triangle inequality theorem and simplifies the inequalities to find the range of possible integral values of $x$.

  "solution": "We have $x<6+5=11$ and $x>6-5=1$, so the possible values of $x$ are from $2$ to $10$, and their difference is $10-2 = \\boxed{8}$.",
