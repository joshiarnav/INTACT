    "To find the length of $\\overline{AD}$, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1.right triangle triangle CDB:\nSince $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, $B$ trisects $\\overline{AB}$, and point $C$ is two segments to the right of $M$ past the 3rd segment marker. Given the trisected information here, $\\overline{CB} = \\overline{BC}$. The midpoint $M$ is exactly in the middle of trisected $\\overline{AB}$, therefore $MC$ = (half of $BC$).\nHowever $\\overline{AD}$ is composed of 2 copies of trisected $\\overline{AB}$. Given that the length of $MC$ is 8 units, 8 is half of one of the trisected $\\overline{BC}$ segments ($BC = 2*8 = 16$), hence the length of the first trisected segment  of $\\overline{AB}$ = 16. By creating a group of 3 trisected segments on $\\overline{AD}$ it can be multiplied together (2 copies of trisected $\\overline{AB}$) to create its full length. \nTherefore the total length of  $\\overline{AD}$ = 2(3*16) = 3 * 32 = $\\boxed{96}$.",
    "To find the length of $\\overline{AD}$, we'll use the given information step by step.\n\nGiven:\n- $B$ and $C$ trisect $\\overline{AD}$\n- $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$\n- $MC = 8$\n\n1. Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$ and $B$ and $C$ trisect $\\overline{AD}$, we know that $MB = MC$. \n\n2. It's also given that $MC = 8$.\n\n3. From the midpoint and trisection information, we can conclude that $MB = MC = 8$. \n\n4. Since $B$ and $C$ trisect $\\overline{AD}$ into three equal parts, the total length of $\\overline{AD}$ can be calculated by tripling the length of $\\overline{BD}$ or $\\overline{CD}$. \n\n5. Given that $MB = 8$, we know that the length of $\\overline{MD}$ would be equally divided into two equal parts at $M$, because $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$.\n\n6. Since $B$ and $C$ trisect, the division at $M$ is at its middle - meaning equally divided again. However, knowing we're breaking AD into 3, then M is 1/3 of the way along AD. \n\n7. With $M$ being $1/3$ of the way from $A$ to $D$, the length $MD$ can be calculated using the formula that if you were to completely split AD, $MD$ is $2/3$ of the length of $AD$.\n\n8. As $MD = MB + BC + CD$, in this case, considering $M$ in the middle, $MD$ (A to M in total) is $8 + BC$ in a trisection form which tells us $A$ to $D = 3(BC)$. BC would simply be $2/3$ of $\\overline{AD}$, analogous to $MC$ in a full trisection - so to solve, let $x$ be the length of $\\overline{AD}$. Then:  $A$ to $B$ = $x/3$, and since $x$ is the total length, and noting that in trisection form (although A to M is slightly different) A to D would equal $3 BC$.\n\n9. Calculating $x$, we consider: $M$ is in the middle in this slightly different trisection division due to the $AD$ midpoint $M$: it means both parts after the midpoint $M$ in trisection, are equal ($BC = C D = 8$).\n\n10. So the equation would look something like this because trisection into three, but in total (A D = BC + BC + BC) because $M$ is centre - so $MD = BC + BC$ - both parts after the centre $M$ $= 8$ each in a trisection division but to centre in total division of $AD$. Then, $AD = 3 \\cdot BC$.\n\n11. Solving for $x$, $AD = 3 \\cdot BC = 3 \\cdot 8$\\because both $BC$ and $C D$ in division equal $8$.\n\n12. Thus, $x = 3 \\cdot 8$",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, we can infer that $AM = MD = x$. \n\n2. We are given that $MC = 8$. Also, since $B$ and $C$ trisect $\\overline{AD}$, the three segments ($AB$, $BC$, and $CD$) are equal in length. So, let's call the length of each segment $y$.\n\n3. From point $M$, we can visualize two segments: $MB$ and $MC$. We are given that $MC = 8$. We can infer that $MB = 2y$ (since it's the longer segment divided by 2), and in total $MB$ and $MC$ would be equal to $3y$. In other words, we have the equation:\n   $MB + MC = 3y$\n   Since we know that $MC = 8$, we substitute this into the equation:\n   $2y + 8 = 3y$\n\n4. However, looking again at point $M$, we are not 100% sure that the total distance across $B$ and $C$ using point $M$ would give us the entire length of segment $AD$ without visualizing the full length in terms of  $y$. (These three points split $AD$ into segments $AD$ = (1) $y$ + (2) $y$ + (3) $y$).\n\n   $AMC$ would be $(2) y + 8 = 2y + 8$\n\nHowever, to find the whole length of the line $AD$ in terms of $y$. When adding $y$, you are just extending $A$ (point 1) (in the visual of the 1, 2, and 3) by one $y$.  (In either case, you know $AD$ would equal 3 times (1) $y$)  Since, in visualizing again, $AD$ =  $y$  + (the visual  2) $y$  + (the visual 3) $y$. That sums up to $AD$ = 3 (1) $y$  in the visual (1,2,3) we also note we had (1) $y$ in the (1) $y$  2$ (visual (1) also  adds in an \"8\" length), and ( in our also the (3) $y$ \"visual\"). That results in $(3) (1) y$ or 3 $y$ = (1) $y$  (That is an \"8\" visual)  +  (in (our (  visual  visual 2)  2) \"y\") (  That is an \"8\" length), and (our in (this 3)  \"visual\") 3  \"y\" or visual (1) $y$.  That becomes the length for the whole segment $AD$ or $AD = 3y$.\n\n   We can infer 3 times (1) is 3  (That is (1) \"y\" and in our (that adds an \"8\") visual \"8\" and (has our \"twoy\") 2 $y$ of length), the length of the whole $AD$ segment is 3 $y$.\n\nHowever, when visualizing the \"8\" as visual 2 $y$,  you must remember (our ( in (that also  adds a visual an \"8\") length), that ( in  also adds 3 \"y\"). That results in our 3 times visual (1)  $y$ of length.\n\n5. Now let's go back to our given information again. In step 3, we wrote the equation $2y +  8 = 3y$.\n\n   Solving for $y$, we subtract $2y$ from both sides:\n   $8 = y$\n\n6. Since we know that $AD = 3y$ (we inferred this in step 4), we substitute the value of $y$ into this equation:\n   $AD = 3(8)$\n\nNow, let's compute the value of $AD$.\n$AD = 3 \\cdot 8 = 24$\n\nSo, the length of $\\overline{AD}$ is 24 units.\n\nIn the format you requested, the answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{24}$"
