    "To find $\\cos 240^\\circ$, we can start by converting it to radians. However, it's not necessary in this case. \n\nSince $240^\\circ$ is in the third quadrant, we can use the following trigonometric identity: $\\cos(180^\\circ + \\theta) = -\\cos \\theta$. \n\nApplying this to the given angle, we have:\n$\\cos 240^\\circ = \\cos (180^\\circ + 60^\\circ) = -\\cos 60^\\circ$\n\nNow, we know that $\\cos 60^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nSo, $-\\cos 60^\\circ = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\cos 240^\\circ = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n$\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$",
    "To compute $\\cos 240^\\circ$, we can use the unit circle.\n\nStep 1: Recall the position of the angle $240^\\circ$.

    "To compute $\\cos 240^\\circ$, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. ** understand the angle**: $240^\\circ$ is in the third quadrant, and it's a multiple of $60^\\circ$. In the unit circle, we can see that $240^\\circ$ is equivalent to $180^\\circ + 60^\\circ$.\n\n2. **recall a relevant identity**: We know that $\\cos(A+B) = \\cos A \\cos B - \\sin A \\sin B$. However, in this case, we can use the fact that $\\cos(180^\\circ+x)= -\\cos x$.\n\n3. **apply the relevant identity**: We want to compute $\\cos 240^\\circ = \\cos(180^\\circ + 60^\\circ)$. We know that $\\cos(180^\\circ+x)= -\\cos x$, so $\\cos 240^\\circ = -\\cos 60^\\circ$.\n\n4. **recall cosine of a known angle**: $\\cos 60^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n5. **compute the final answer**: $\\cos 240^\\circ = -\\cos 60^\\circ = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSo, the final answer is: \n\n$\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$"
