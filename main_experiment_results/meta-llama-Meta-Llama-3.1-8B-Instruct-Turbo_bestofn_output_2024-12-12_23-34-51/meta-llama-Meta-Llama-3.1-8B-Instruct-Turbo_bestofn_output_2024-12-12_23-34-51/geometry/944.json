    "To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Recall the formula for the area of a trapezoid, which is given by: \n\nArea = $\\frac{1}{2}$ \u00d7 (sum of parallel sides) \u00d7 height.\n\nGiven the parallel sides $AB$ and $CD$ have lengths of 8 and 20 units and the altitude is 12 units, we can substitute these values into the formula.\n\nArea = $\\frac{1}{2}$ \u00d7 (8 + 20) \u00d7 12\n= $\\frac{1}{2}$ \u00d7 28 \u00d7 12\n= 14 \u00d7 12\n= 168 square units.\n\nThis is the area of the entire trapezoid $ABCD$.\n\nStep 2:  Since points $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of sides $AD$ and $BC$, respectively, quadrilateral $EFCD$ is a trapezoid with half the altitude of the original trapezoid.\n\nThe original trapezoid $ABCD$ has an altitude of 12 units, so the altitude of the trapezoid $EFCD$ is 6 units.\n\nStep 3: Use the formula for the area of a trapezoid, substituting the length of the parallel sides and the altitude of the new trapezoid $EFCD$.\n\nAB and CD are still 8 and 20,  as only E and F were on AB and BC, and not directly on AB or CD and the area formula will give the desired result without needing a diagram drawing exercise.\n\nWe will therefore use the formula as before for a simpler and more elegant solution and make sure we substitute all the values we are given into the area formula.\n\nArea = $\\frac{1}{2}$ \u00d7 (8 + 20) \u00d7 6\n= $\\frac{1}{2}$ \u00d7 28 \u00d7 6\n= 14 \u00d7 6\n= 84 square units.\n\nTherefore, the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ is 84 square units.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{84}$",

    "To find the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$, we need to find the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ and then subtract the area of triangle $AEF$ from it. \n\nFirst, let's find the area of trapezoid $ABCD$. The area of a trapezoid can be calculated using the formula: \n\nArea = $(\\frac{a + b}{2}) * h$\n\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the parallel sides, and $h$ is the height (or altitude) of the trapezoid. \n\nHere, $a = 8$, $b = 20$, and $h = 12$. \n\nArea of trapezoid $ABCD$ = $(\\frac{8 + 20}{2}) * 12$\n= $(\\frac{28}{2}) * 12$\n= $14 * 12$\n= $168$ square units.\n\nNow, let's find the area of triangle $AEF$. Triangle $AEF$ is a right-angled triangle, and its altitude is half of the altitude of trapezoid $ABCD$, which is $12 / 2 = 6$ units. \n\nThe length of $AF$ can be found by noticing that $A$, $F$, and $C$ are collinear because $AB$ is parallel to $CD$. The length of $AF$ will be the average of $AB$ and $DC$ since $F$ is the midpoint of $BC$ and $A$ to $F$ is a line.\nSo, the length of $AF$ will be \n\n$AF$ = $(\\frac{AB + DC}{2})$\n= $(\\frac{8 + 20}{2})$\n= $(\\frac{28}{2})$\n= 14 units\n\nHowever we must calculate $AE$ the same way, since $E$ is also the midpoint of $AD$, then\n\n$AE$ = $(\\frac{AD + AB}{2})$\n= $(\\frac{? + 8}{2})$ \n\nUnfortunately we do not know the measure of  the side $AD$ \n\nHowever since we are given the altitutde the the trapezoid is $12$ units, the altitude of triangle $AEF$ will be 6 ( the half of the trapezoid's altitude ) .\n\nTherefore the area of $AEF$ =  $0.5 * AE * 6$\n\nBut wait, $AE$ is the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose the sides are 6 units ( the altitude of $AEF$ ) and \n\n$?$ since the the trapezoid has an altitude of 12, the the triangle at the top with the altitude 12, must have an internal section of length $8$ units ( For one of sides of the  trapezoid the the side, with the altitude going through, is 8 units)  the the side, with the altitude going through, of the other triangle  is ? units , since the both triangles are similar ( The top triangles  share, the same angle at the top, and they have, parallel bases).\n\nSince the area of $AEF$ =  $0.5 * AE * 6$ needs the value of AE\n\nFirst find $AE$. Use pythagoras \n\n $? ^ 2$ + $6 ^ 2$ = $AE ^ 2$ -----(1)\n$8 ^ 2$ +$12^2$ = ?$^2$ -----(2)\n\nSince the triangles top triangles are similar the ratio of the lengths, of the corresponding sides, is the same as the ratio of the corresponding altitudes, 6/12= $?$/8\n\n Simplify 3/6 = 1/2 = ?/8\n? = 4, substitute the value in (2)\n4 ^ 2 + $12^2$ = ?$^2$\n16 + 144 = ?$^2$\n? $^2$ = 160 \n  ? =  $12.65$ units \n\nThus using (1)\n $(12.65)^2$ + $6 ^ 2$ = $(AE)^2$ \n $160.82 + 36$ = $164.82 $= $(AE)^2$\nTherefore, $(AE) = $12.65$ units$\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle $AEF$ = $0.5 * 12.65 * 6$ = $37.95$\n\nNow, to find the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$, we need to subtract the area of triangle $AEF$ from the area of trapezoid $ABCD$. \n\nArea of $EFCD$ = Area of $ABCD$ - Area of $AEF$\n= $168 - 37.95$\n= $130.05$\n\nWhen rounding this to a whole number  it is $130$."
