    "To solve this, let's consider the steps below.\n\nStep 1: After folding, segment $\\overline{CF}$ becomes $\\overline{EF}$ because the fold creates a crease, essentially mirroring segment $\\overline{CF}$.\n\nStep 2: We can say that $CF = EF$, so $6 - x = x$, where $x$ is the length of $\\overline{FD}$.\n\nStep 3: Now we need to solve the equation. $6 - x = x$.\n\nStep 4: We add $x$ to both sides of the equation: $6 = 2x$.\n\nStep 5: Now, we divide both sides by 2 to find $x$: $x = 6/2$.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{6}{2}}$",

When $C$ is folded over to coincide with $E$, the length of $\\overline{CF}$ will be the sum of the length of $\\overline{FD}$ and the length of $\\overline{DE}$.\n\nThe length of $\\overline{DE}$ is half of the side length of the square, which is $\\frac{6}{2} = 3$ cm.\n\nSince the square is folded, the triangle $\\triangle CFD$ is an isosceles right triangle.

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the figure step by step.\n\nStep 1:  After folding the corner $C$ to coincide with $E$, the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, we get the crease $\\overline{GF}$.\nStep 2:  As a result of the fold, we can infer that $\\triangle FDE$ is a right triangle (because the angle at $D$ becomes a right angle).\nStep 3:  When we fold the corner, side $\\overline{CF}$ and side $\\overline{DE}$ become the same length (because we're essentially reflecting $\\overline{CF}$ over $\\overline{DE}$).\nStep 4:  So, we have $CF = DE = 3$ (as side length $CD = 6$ and $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$).\nStep 5:  Let's consider the relationship between $DF$ and $CF$. Given that we now have a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem: $(CD)^2 = (CF)^2 + (DF)^2$.\nStep 6:  Plugging in the values we have, we get $6^2 = 3^2 + (DF)^2$. Simplifying this gives us $36 = 9 + (DF)^2$.\nStep 7:  Subtracting $9$ from both sides yields $27 = (DF)^2$.\nStep 8:  To solve for $DF$, we need to find the square root of both sides of the equation. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $DF = \\sqrt{27}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying the square root of $27$ as $\\sqrt{27} = 3\\sqrt{3}$, we get the length of $\\overline{FD}$ to be $3\\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the length of $\\overline{FD}$ is $\\boxed{3\\sqrt{3}}$ units.\n\nHowever, you wanted the answer in common fraction format as per your requirements, let's convert it:\n\nIf we convert $3\\sqrt{3}$ into a common fraction as you requested: \n$3\\sqrt{3} = 3\\sqrt{3} * ( \\sqrt{3}/ \\sqrt{3}) $\n$=  3 *  \\sqrt{9}  / \\sqrt{3}  $\n$=   3 * 3 / \\sqrt{3}  $\n$=   9/\\sqrt{3}  $\n$=  9 * \\sqrt{3} / ( \\sqrt{3})^2  $\n$=  9 * \\sqrt{3}  / 3 $\n$=  3 * \\sqrt{3}  $\nThis is the decimal equivalent we used previously.
