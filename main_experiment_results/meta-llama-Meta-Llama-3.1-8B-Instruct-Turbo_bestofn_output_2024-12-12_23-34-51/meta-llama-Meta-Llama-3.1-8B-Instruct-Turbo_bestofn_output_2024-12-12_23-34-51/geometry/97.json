    "To find the area of the shaded region, we first need to find the area of the entire regular hexagon. A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles. \n\nThe area of one equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$. \n\nHere, the side length of the hexagon is 10 cm, so the area of one equilateral triangle is:\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(10)^2 = 25\\sqrt{3}$\n\nSince the hexagon is made up of 6 equilateral triangles, the area of the entire hexagon is $6 \\times 25\\sqrt{3} = 150\\sqrt{3}$ square centimeters.\n\nThe shaded area is the area of the entire hexagon minus the area of the unshaded equilateral triangle (formed by vertices A, B, C, D) and equilateral triangle ADE. \n\nTherefore, we must subtract the area of two of these equilateral triangles from the total area of the hexagon. Thus we need to subtract twice the area of the equilateral triangle ADE. \n\nSubtracting the area of two of these equilateral triangles:\n\n$150\\sqrt{3} - 2(25\\sqrt{3})$\n$= 150\\sqrt{3} - 50\\sqrt{3}$\n$= 100\\sqrt{3}$ square centimeters\n\nTherefore, the area of the shaded region is $\\boxed{100\\sqrt{3}}$.",
