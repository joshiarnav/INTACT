    "To find the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands at 8:15, we need to consider their positions.\n\n1. The hour hand moves 30 degrees for each hour and moves in between the hours. Since 1 degree of the clock is $\\frac{360^\\circ}{12} = 30^\\circ$, it will also move $\\frac{30^\\circ}{60} = 0.5^\\circ$ per minute. At 8:00, it would be at $8 \\times 30^\\circ = 240^\\circ$. Then, it will move an additional $15 \\times 0.5^\\circ = 7.5^\\circ$. Thus, the hour hand is at $240^\\circ + 7.5^\\circ = 247.5^\\circ$.\n\n2. The minute hand moves 360 degrees for each 60 minutes, which is 6 degrees per minute. At 15 minutes past the hour, it is at $15 \\times 6^\\circ = 90^\\circ$.\n\nNow, we need to find the angle between these two positions. Since the hour hand is at $247.5^\\circ$ and the minute hand is at $90^\\circ$, the angle between them is the absolute difference of these two positions. This angle is $247.5^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 157.5^\\circ$. \n\nHowever, we might be asked for the smaller one, so we'll check the angle on the other side of $360^\\circ$. We can find the smaller one by subtracting the angle from $360^\\circ$. The smaller angle is $360^\\circ - 157.5^\\circ = 202.5^\\circ$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's start by understanding how to measure the angles formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock.\n\n1. **Minute Hand Position:** At 15 minutes past the hour, the minute hand is exactly 1/4 of the way around the clock face. There are 360 degrees in a circle, so each minute represents a 360 / 60 = 6 degree movement. This means that at 15 minutes past the hour, the minute hand has moved 6 * 15 = 90 degrees.\n\n2. **Hour Hand Position:** The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, or 30 degrees per hour. However, since the hour hand also moves gradually between the hours (i.e., it moves $\\frac{30^{\\circ} \\cdot 60}{60 \\cdot 60} = \\frac{30}{60}$ degrees per minute), we need to consider this movement for our specific time.\n\nAt 8:15, the hour hand has moved through 8 full hours (which is 8 * 30 = 240 degrees) and then another 15 * $\\frac{30}{60}$ = 7.5 degrees for the 15 minutes past the hour. 7.5 since 30/60 = (1/2) * 30 = 15 degrees per 1 min, after the whole hours we after 15 min move 15 * 15 = 225.",
    "To find the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock at 8:15, we'll break this down into steps.\n\n1. **Find the position of the hour hand**: \n   - The hour hand moves 30 degrees for each hour (360 degrees / 12 hours) and moves as the minutes pass.\n   - At 8:15, the hour hand has moved 8 hours and 15 minutes (out of 60 minutes). \n   - It has moved 8 * 30 = 240 degrees for the 8 hours. \n   - For the 15 minutes, we can find its contribution by calculating how much the hour hand moves every minute. \n   - It moves 0.5 degrees per minute (30 degrees per hour / 60 minutes = 0.5 degrees per minute). \n   - So, for 15 minutes, it would have moved 0.5 * 15 = 7.5 degrees. \n   - So, the total position of the hour hand is 240 + 7.5 = 247.5 degrees.\n\n2. **Find the position of the minute hand**: \n   - The minute hand moves 6 degrees for each minute (360 degrees / 60 minutes).\n   - At 8:15, the minute hand would have moved 15 * 6 = 90 degrees.\n\n3. **Find the smaller angle between the two hands**:\n   - We can subtract the position of the minute hand from the position of the hour hand. \n   - But we must be careful as we might end up with an angle greater than 180 degrees (the angle between the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions). \n   - To avoid this, we can subtract the position of the hour hand from 360 degrees and see which is smaller.\n   - So, we have:\n     - 247.5 - 90 = 157.5 (this is within 180 degrees)\n     - 360 - 247.5 = 112.5 (this is also within 180 degrees)\n   - So, the smaller angle is 112.5 degrees.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{112.5}$"

  "solution": "At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{2}{3}(360^\\circ)=240$ degrees.  Every minute, the minute hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}(360^\\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12} (360^\\circ)=0.5$ degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.  After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\\circ-5.5^\\circ\\cdot 15=\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees.",
