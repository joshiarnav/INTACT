    "To find the set of all possible values of $f(x,y,z)$, let's consider the given expression step by step.\n\nGiven: $f(x,y,z) = \\frac{x}{x + y} + \\frac{y}{y + z} + \\frac{z}{z + x}$\n\nSince $x,$ $y,$ $z$ are positive real numbers, it follows that each term of the expression is positive.\n\nNow, we want to find the range of values that $f(x,y,z)$ can take. To do this, we can try to find the minimum and maximum values of the expression.\n\nWe can use the following inequality: $\\frac{a}{b} \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{a+b}{a+b} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSince the fraction is at least 1/2, the fraction is at most 1.5.\n\nWe can rewrite the expression $f(x,y,z)$ as:\n\n$$\nf(x,y,z) = \\frac{x}{x+y} + \\frac{y}{y+z} + \\frac{z}{z+x} = \\frac{x+y+z}{x+y} + \\frac{y+z+x}{y+z} + \\frac{z+x+y}{z+x} = 2 + \\frac{y+z+x}{x+y} + \\frac{z+x+y}{y+z} + \\frac{x+y+z}{z+x}\n$$\n\nFrom the earlier inequality, we know that $\\frac{y+z+x}{x+y} \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{z+x+y}{y+z} \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{x+y+z}{z+x} \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThis means $f(x,y,z) \\geq 2 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 3$.\n\nWe can use Squeeze Theorem: Since the lower and upper bounds are equal at $x = y = z$ and $f(x,y,z) \\geq 3$, the infimum of $f(x,y,z)$ is 1.\n\nNow, consider $\\frac{a}{b} \\leq \\frac{2}{3}$. Therefore, we can say that $f(x,y,z) = \\frac{x}{x + y} + \\frac{y}{y + z} + \\frac{z}{z + x} \\leq 2$. This is the upper bound for Squeeze Theorem.\n\nSince Squeeze Theorem gave the lower and upper bounds, $f(x,y,z)$ is a closed interval between lower and upper bounds of $1$ and $2$.\n\nThe set of all possible values of $f(x,y,z)$ is, therefore, the closed interval $\\boxed{[1, 2]}$.",
    "To find the set of all possible values of $f(x,y,z)$, let's first consider the given expression:\n\n\\[f(x,y,z) = \\frac{x}{x + y} + \\frac{y}{y + z} + \\frac{z}{z + x}.\\]\n\nTo simplify the problem, we'll consider some inequalities that can help us understand the behavior of the function.\n\nOne inequality that can be helpful is the Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. Applying the AM-GM inequality to the terms in the function, we get:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\frac{x}{x + y} + \\frac{y}{y + z} + \\frac{z}{z + x}}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{x}{x+y} \\cdot \\frac{y}{y+z} \\cdot \\frac{z}{z+x}}.\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the inequality and re-arranging, we get:\n\n\\[f(x,y,z) \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{x}{x + y} \\cdot \\frac{y}{y + z} \\cdot \\frac{z}{z + x}}.\\]\n\nThis lower bound gives us a starting point to understand the behavior of the function.\n\nAnother approach to consider is the upper bound. We can use the fact that the terms in the function are less than or equal to 1 to establish an upper bound. \n\nSince each term is less than or equal to 1, we can write the following:\n\n\\[\\frac{x}{x + y} \\leq 1,\\]\n\\[\\frac{y}{y + z} \\leq 1,\\]\n\\[\\frac{z}{z + x} \\leq 1.\\]\n\nAdding these inequalities together and re-arranging, we get:\n\n\\[f(x,y,z) \\leq 2.\\]\n\nThis establishes an upper bound for the function.\n\nThe next step is to consider the lower and upper bounds for the function and look for values that the function can achieve. \n\nLet's look at the equality case for the AM-GM inequality. Equality in the AM-GM inequality occurs when all the terms are equal. \n\nIn this case, we have:\n\\[\\frac{x}{x + y} = \\frac{y}{y + z} = \\frac{z}{z + x} = a,\\]\nwhere $a$ is the common term.\n\nSolving for the variables in terms of $a$, we get:\n\\[x = a(y + z),\\]\n\\[y = a(z + x),\\]\n\\[z = a(x + y).\\]\n\nSubstituting these expressions into each other, we get:\n\\[x = a(a(z + x) + z),\\]\n\\[x = a(az + a^2 x + z),\\]\n\\[x = az + a^2 x + az.\\]\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\\[x = az + a^2 x + az.\\]\n\\[a^2 x = a(2z).\\]\n\\[x = (2) \\cdot (z) / ( a )\\]\n\nUsing the above expression for $x$ and simplifying the other variables as well, we will find that:\n\\[x = az + a^2 x + az\\]\n\\[a = a ( x + y + z ) / ( x + y + z ).\\]\n\\[a = ( x + y + z ) / ( a + a + a )\\]\n\nIt follows that:\n\\[a = x + y + z.\\]\n\nNow, let's plug the fact that $a = x + y + z$ back into the expressions for $x, y,$ and $z$.\n\nRemember that:\n\\[x = a(y + z),\\]\n\\[y = a(z + x),\\]\n\\[z = a(x + y).\\]\n\nBy plugging $a = x + y + z$ back into these expressions, we find that the following equalities hold:\n\n\\[x = x + y + z)(y + z),\\]\n\\[y = (x + y + z)(z + x),\\]\n\\[z = a(x + y).\\]\n\nLet's plug the fact that each of $x, y,$ and $z$ are equal to the same value, denoted $(a)^2$, into the expressions for $x, y,$ and $z$ and into the three terms of the function $f(x,y,z)$. We find that the following equalities hold:\n\n\\[x = (x + y + z)^2,\\]\n\\[y = (y + z + x)^2,\\]\n\\[z = (x + y + z)^2,\\]\n\nThe three terms of $f(x,y,z)$ become:\n\n\\[\\frac{(x + y + z)^2}{2(x + y + z)},\\]\n\\[\\frac{(x + y + z)^2}{2(x + y + z)},\\]\n\\[\\frac{(x + y + z)^2}{2(x + y + z)},\\]\n\nUsing these equalities, we find that the function reduces to the following expression:\n\n\\[f(x,y,z) = \\frac{(x + y + z)^2}{2(x + y + z)}.\\]\n\nUsing the above expression for the function, we will find that the function $f(x,y,z)$ is equal to the following expression:\n\n\\[f(x,y,z) = \\frac{ (x + y + z)^2 }{ 2(x + y + z) } = \\frac{ (x + y + z) }{ 2 }.\\]\n\nThis gives the equality case.\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ and $z$ are positive real numbers, it follows that $x + y + z$ is a positive real number, and therefore $f(x,y,z)$ is also a positive real number.\n\nIn addition, we can see that the lower bound of $f(x,y,z)$ is greater than or equal to 1.\n\nUsing the upper bound of $f(x,y,z)$, we find that the upper bound is 2.\n\nTherefore, the set of all possible values of the function $f(x,y,z)$ is contained between 1 and 2.\n\nIn addition, we can see that the equality case occurs when each of the $x, y,$ and $z$ variables are equal to the same value.\n\nThe possible values that $x, y,$ and $z$ can take for the equality case are real numbers $> 0$. \n\nTherefore, we are looking for the set of possible values of $\\frac{ x + y + z }{ 2 }$ where the $x, y,$ and $z$ are positive real numbers.\n\nThis set of possible values is contained between 1 and 2.\n\nIn addition, the equality case can occur when the $x, y,$ and $z$ variables are equal to any positive real number.\n\nTherefore, the set of possible values of the function $f(x,y,z)$ is the set of real numbers in the interval $[1, 2)$.",
    "To find the set of all possible values of $f(x,y,z)$, we first note that the function involves fractions, so we need to consider the restrictions on the variables.\n\nSince $x,$ $y,$ $z$ are positive real numbers, the denominators in each fraction cannot be zero. \n\nNow, let's look closer at the function. We can observe that each term in the function is of the form $\\frac{a}{a + b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the variables $x,$ $y,$ $z$. \n\nWe can try to simplify the expression by finding a common denominator, but it's not necessary in this case.\n\nTo find the minimum value of $f(x,y,z)$, we can use the inequality technique or the method of substitution.\n\nWe can utilize the method of substitution by letting \n\n$x = y = z = a$,  $x = y = a, z = 2a$, $x = a, y = 2a, z = a$, $x = 2a, y = a, z = a$, and the general case $x = ka, y = a, z = a$.\n\nHowever, if we consider all possible values, if $x = y = z = a$, \nf(a, a, a) = $\\frac{a}{a} + \\frac{a}{a} + \\frac{a}{a} = 3$\n\nHowever, if $x = y = a, z = 2a$, f(a, a, 2a) = $\\frac{a}{a + a} + \\frac{a}{a + 2a} + \\frac{2a}{2a + a} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = 1$.\n\nSimilarly, if $x = a, y = 2a, z = a$, f(a, 2a, a) = $\\frac{a}{a + 2a} + \\frac{2a}{2a + a} + \\frac{a}{a + a} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{3}  = 1$\n\nFinally, if $x = 2a, y = a, z = a$, we see that in this case the value of f(a, a, 2a) = f(a, 2a, a) = 1.\n\nSince $1 \\le f(a,a,a) \\le 1$ for all positive a, we might expect that  f(x, y, z) can take on any value greater than or equal to 1. However, we still need to consider the upper bound.\n\nNow we consider the upper bound of the function f(x,y,z). For a general term  in f(x,y,z) we have 0 < $\\frac{x}{x+y} \\le 1$. Equality holds  $\\frac{x}{x+y} = 1$ when $x = y = 0$, equivalent to $0 < y < x$. This is a possibility but not the case here.\n\nHowever,  $\\frac{x}{x+y} = \\frac{1}{2}$ when 2x = x + y or x = $\\frac{y}{2-1}$ = y/1 or x = y\n\nNow we check the case when  $\\frac{x}{x+y} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\epsilon $, $\\frac{y}{y + z}$ =  $\\frac{1}{2} + \\epsilon$, where $0 < \\epsilon < 0.5$.\n\nIn this case, the fraction $\\frac{z}{z+x}$ might have a smaller or larger value than  $\\frac{1}{2} + \\epsilon$ or $\\frac{1}{2} - \\epsilon$ respectively.\n\nThus, we have the possibilities of the set of values 1 $\\le$ f(x, y, z)$ \\le 2$. \n\nHowever, this doesn't hold. \n\nIn order to get closer to the upper bound of f, we must have the terms $\\frac{x}{x+y}$, $\\frac{y}{y+z}$, and  $\\frac{z}{z+x}$ equal at least equal to the smallest value of the three  of $\\frac{x}{x+y} + \\frac{y}{y+z} + \\frac{z}{z+x}$\n\n\nLet's try the case when the terms are equal, meaning that $\\frac{x}{x+y}$ = $\\frac{y}{y+z}$ = $\\frac{z}{z+x} = p$,  where $0 < p \\le 1$. Then  x = py(p+1), y = pz(p+1), z = px(p+1)\n\n$\\frac{x}{x+y} = \\frac{y}{y+z} = \\frac{z}{z+x} = p = \\frac{x}{x+y+z}$\n\nor x = py(p+1), y = pz(p+1), z = px(p+1), x + y + z = (2p + p^2)(x + y + z)$\n\nor  1 = 2p + p^2, $\\Delta = (2p + p^2)^2 - 4 \\le  0$ holds only for p = 1, p = 0,  p = -2\n\nSince p might be only positive 0 < p <= 1, we find that p = 1 might be true\n\nf(x, y, z) = p + p + p = 3p.\n\nSince $0 < p \\le 1$, 1 $\\le$ f(x, y, z) $\\le$ 3.\n\nThus, the set of all possible values of $f(x,y,z)$ is [1, 2).\n\nWe thus get that the set of all possible values of f(x,y,z) is $\\boxed{[1,2)}$."
