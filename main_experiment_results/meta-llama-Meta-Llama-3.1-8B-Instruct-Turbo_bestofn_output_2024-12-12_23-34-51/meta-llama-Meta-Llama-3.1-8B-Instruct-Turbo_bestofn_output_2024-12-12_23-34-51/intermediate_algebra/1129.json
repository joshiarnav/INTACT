    "To find the quotient when $8x^3+16x^2-7x+4$ is divided by $2x+5$, we can use polynomial long division or synthetic division. Here, we'll use polynomial long division.\n\n1. The divisor is $2x+5$. To make the process simpler, we can rewrite it as $2(x+2.5)$, but we'll keep the standard form for the divisor, $2x+5$.\n\n2. Divide the leading term of the dividend ($8x^3$) by the leading term of the divisor ($2x$), which gives us $4x^2$. This is the first term of the quotient.\n\n   Here's the partial result: \n   $(4x^2)(2x+5) = 8x^3+20x^2$\n\n   Now, subtract it from the original dividend: \n   $8x^3+16x^2-7x+4 - (8x^3+20x^2) = -4x^2-7x+4$\n\n3. Now, bring down the next term. We already have $-4x^2$.\n\n4. Divide the leading term of our current result $(-4x^2)$ by the leading term of the divisor ($2x$), which gives us $-2x$. This is the next term of the quotient.\n\n   Here's the partial result:\n   $(-2x)(2x+5) = -4x^2-10x$\n\n   Now, subtract it from our current result: \n   $-4x^2-7x+4 - (-4x^2-10x) = 3x+4$\n\n5. Now, bring down the next term. We already have $3x$.\n\n6. Divide the leading term of our current result $(3x)$ by the leading term of the divisor ($2x$), which gives us $\\frac{3}{2}$. This is the next term of the quotient.\n\n   Here's the partial result:\n   $(\\frac{3}{2})(2x+5) = 3x+\\frac{15}{2}$\n\n   Now, subtract it from our current result: \n   $3x+4 - (3x+\\frac{15}{2}) = -\\frac{7}{2}$\n\n\n7. We have a remainder, $-\\frac{7}{2}$.\n\n8. The quotient is the sum of the terms we found: $4x^2 - 2x + \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\n\nSo, when $8x^3+16x^2-7x+4$ is divided by $2x+5$, the quotient is:\n\n$\\boxed{4x^2 - 2x + \\frac{3}{2}}$",

    "To find the quotient, we can perform polynomial division. \n\nStep 1: Divide the leading term of the dividend (8x^3) by the leading term of the divisor (2x). \n   The result is 4x^2.\n\nStep 2: Multiply the divisor (2x+5) by 4x^2 and subtract it from the dividend (8x^3+16x^2-7x+4).\n   (8x^3 + 16x^2) - (8x^3 + 20x^2) \nNon-leading terms (16x^2 - 20x^2) = -4x^2 \n   We also get -7x from the original dividend, and 4 from the original dividend.\n\nStep 3: Divide the leading term of the result from step 2 (-4x^2) by the leading term of the divisor (2x).\n   The result is -2x.\n\nStep 4: Multiply the divisor (2x+5) by -2x and subtract it from the result of step 2 (-4x^2 -7x+4).\n   (-4x^2 - 7x) - (-4x^2 - 10x) \nNon-leading terms (-7x + 10x) = 3x \n   We also get 4 from the original result, so 4 - 0 = 4.\n\nStep 5: We've now reached the end of the leading terms, so the next step is to bring down the constant term (which is already at the end) and then divide by the leading term of the divisor (2x). \n   The result is 2.\n\nStep 6: We multiply the divisor (2x+5) by 2 and subtract it from the result of step 4 (3x+4).\n   (3x + 0) - (6x + 10)\nNon-leading terms are a leading term of a polynomial that we need to consider in next steps - but here we just know that 3x - 6x = -3x \n   We also get 4 - 10 = -6 from the original result.\n\nStep 7: Now divide -3x by the leading term of the divisor (2x).\n   The result is -3/2.\n\nStep 8: Multiply the divisor (2x+5) by -3/2 and subtract it from the result of step 6 (-3x-6).\n   (-3x+3/2x + -3/2*5) \n   The non-leading terms in (2x + -5) are -3/2 -15/2 = -18/2 -3x + 3x/2.\n   -18/2 simplifies 9\n\nThe result is therefore 4x^2 - 2x - 3 + -18/2x -18/2+ 4 \nThis simplifies to  4x^2 - 2x - 3 -9 -18/2x +4 \nSimplifying further -18/2x becomes -9x \n   Finally  -9 is a constant in  -9 x 1 \n   This simplifies to 4x^2 - 2x -3 -9 + 4 -9x \nRemoving leading and non leading terms in -9 +4 that we need to keep in -9 - -4 \n   Which becomes  4x^2 - 2x  - 9 - 9x +  4 - 4\nSo -4 gets cancelled with 4 leading leading terms resulting in  4 -4\nNon leading terms - 9 -9 -4 + 4 \n-Non leading term results in -9.\nleading terms 4x^2 -

  "critique": "To determine the correctness of each solution, let's analyze them step by step.\n\nSolution 1 is a clear and step-by-step approach to polynomial long division. It correctly identifies the quotient as $4x^2 - 2x + \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nSolution 2 also uses polynomial long division, but it doesn't show the intermediate steps explicitly. However, the final answer is $x^2 - 3x + 2$, which is not the same as the other two solutions. This discrepancy suggests that Solution 2 may be incorrect.\n\nSolution 3 is a detailed and step-by-step approach to polynomial long division. However, the solution becomes convoluted and difficult to follow towards the end. The final answer is $4x^2 - 2x - 3 -9x + 4 - 4$, which simplifies to $4x^2 - 11x - 9$. This answer is different from the other two solutions, suggesting that Solution 3 may be incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, Solution 1 is the most accurate and clear approach to the problem. Therefore, the best solution is:\n\n1",
