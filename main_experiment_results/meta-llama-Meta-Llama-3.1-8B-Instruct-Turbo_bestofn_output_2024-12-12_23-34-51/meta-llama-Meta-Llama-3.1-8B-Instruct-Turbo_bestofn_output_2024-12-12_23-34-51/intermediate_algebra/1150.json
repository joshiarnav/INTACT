    "To find the monic quadratic polynomial with real coefficients, we need to consider the complex conjugate of the given root. The complex conjugate of $-2 - i\\sqrt{5}$ is $-2 + i\\sqrt{5}$. \n\nSince a polynomial with real coefficients is unchanged when its complex roots are replaced by their complex conjugates, we know the other root of the polynomial is $-2 + i\\sqrt{5}$. \n\nA monic quadratic polynomial in the form of $x^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1r_2$ where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are its roots. \n\nTo find the polynomial, we use the fact that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-\\frac{b}{a}$ and the product of the roots is $\\frac{c}{a}$. Since the polynomial is monic, $a = 1$.\n\nThe sum of the roots, $r_1 + r_2$ is:\n$-2 - i\\sqrt{5} + (-2 + i\\sqrt{5}) = -4$\n\nThe product of the roots, $r_1r_2$ is:\n$(-2 - i\\sqrt{5})(-2 + i\\sqrt{5}) = (-2)^2 - (i\\sqrt{5})^2 = 4 - (i^2)(\\sqrt{5})^2 = 4 - (-1)(5) = 4 + 5 = 9$\n\nNow we can write the quadratic polynomial in the form:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1r_2 & = x^2 + 4x + 9\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo, the monic quadratic polynomial in the format $\\boxed{answer}$ is:\n$\\boxed{x^2 + 4x + 9}$",

    "To find the monic quadratic polynomial with real coefficients, we need to find its roots.
