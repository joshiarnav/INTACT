    "To solve this problem, we can start by using the change of base formula for logarithms: $\\text{log}_ba = \\frac{\\text{log}a}{\\text{log}b}$.\n\nUsing this formula, we can rewrite the given equation: \n\n$\\frac{1}{\\frac{\\text{log}a}{\\text{log}2}} + \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\text{log}a}{\\text{log}3}} + \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\text{log}a}{\\text{log}4}} = 1$\n\nNow, simplify each fraction:\n\n$\\frac{\\text{log}2}{\\text{log}a} + \\frac{\\text{log}3}{\\text{log}a} + \\frac{\\text{log}4}{\\text{log}a} = 1$\n\nSince all three fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them:\n\n$\\frac{\\text{log}2 + \\text{log}3 + \\text{log}4}{\\text{log}a} = 1$\n\nNow, use the property of logarithms that $\\text{log}a + \\text{log}b = \\text{log}(ab)$. \n\n$\\frac{\\text{log}(2 * 3 * 4)}{\\text{log}a} = \\frac{\\text{log}24}{\\text{log}a} = 1$\n\nMultiply both sides by $\\text{log}a$ to get rid of the denominator:\n\n$\\text{log}24 = \\text{log}a$\n\nNow, we can use the fact that if $\\text{log}x = \\text{log}y$, then $x = y$.
