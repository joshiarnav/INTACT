    "Step 1: Given the properties of function $f$, we need to find the sum of all possible values of $f(30)$. To do this, we must first understand the behavior and properties of the function based on the given conditions.\n\nStep 2: \nThe condition $(ii)$ implies that $f$ is a multiplicative function. For positive integers $m$ and $n$, $f(mn) = f(m)f(n)$. Since $f$ is also increasing, and $f(1) > f(0)$. \nAs $f(1) > f(0)$ and there is only one possible positive integer function of output that is always greater than $f(0)$, which is to output 1 and the least possible positive integer. However, $f(0)$ doesn't exist according to the initial post, so let's consider $f(1)$ as the starting point. \nThis also implies that $f(1) = 1$ because the function is increasing. A value greater than 1 for $f(1)$ would lead to inconsistencies with its multiplicative nature.\n\nStep 3: Since $f$ is an increasing function, the minimum possible value of $f(2)$ is 4, which would lead to contradictions if all other numbers mapped to their own squares.\n\nStep 4: If we consider the equation $2^4 = 4^2$, then the only number that satisfies this equation is $f(2) = 4$.\nStep 5: \nThis means $f(2^2) = f(4) = 8$. However $4^3 \\neq 3^4$, indicating that $f(4)$ cannot be 4 larger than $f(3)$. \nThis contradiction arises from condition (iii). Given the constraint that $f(m) = n$ or $f(n) = m$ when $m^n = n^m$, and $f(3) = 27$ which matches the other extreme condition for $2^4 = 4^2$. \nHowever we can't have number outputted larger than 4, larger than $f(2)$. \nNow solving for the values of the two sides of our equation \n $f(3) > 4$\nSince the minimum number is 4 and the function should be increasing.\n\nStep 6: \nThe value of 27 in $f(3)$ along with increasing property now also tells us that our function will be able to compute the minimum $f(2)$ and based on that minimum we can confirm that the current minimum for the value of this function is \n4.\n\n\n\nStep 7:\nNow that we know $f(2) = 4$ and that the output is always greater than or equal to 4 and we also know that the rest of the $f(n)$ should be squared except for one.

Following condition (ii) and therefore the knowledge of $f(9) = f(3^2) =  (f(3))^2$, but since $3^4=27^2$ we're still unable to see which number is our missing function value.\n\n\n\nStep 9: Again, finding our missing function output to see if we can solve for the rest of the missing values, we can use the same rules again.\n\nStep 10: Using $f(5) > f(4)$ and taking all information together, and by the information about our current function, $(f(5))^2 = f(25) = 625$. However, without knowledge of the other value, we can't still solve for which two function values are missing and we don't have a clear number for function $f(5)$.\n\n\n\nStep 11: Following output rules and taking values from larger numbers to find rest of function.

Following taking rule of (iii) we conclude that $f(6) > f(5) > f(3) > f(2) > f(1)$ or  $f(6) < f(5) < f(3) < f(2) < f(1)$ are plausible outputs.\n\n\n\nStep 15: Sometimes rules in functions don't rule previous plausible values, rest $f(6)$ with rules that have been known.

    "To find the sum of all possible values of $f(30),$ we need to consider the properties of the function $f$ given in the problem. \n\nFirst, we observe that from (iii), we have $2^4 = 4^2$, so either $f(2) = 4$ or $f(4) = 2.$ However, since $f$ is increasing, we cannot have $f(4) = 2$; therefore $f(2) = 4.$\n\nNow, from (ii), we have $f(mn) = f(m) f(n)$. We can try $f(2) = 4,$ so if $f(3) = 3,$ we have $f(6) = 12.$ But we cannot have $f(5) = 5,$ since then we must have $f(2) = f(5) \\cdot f(1) = 5f(1) > 5.$  Since $f(2) = 4,$ we must have $f(5) = 25$ or $f(1) = 25,$ but then we cannot have $f(5) = 25,$ as the given function properties do not allow for this. Furthermore note that the values of f cannot be in a cyclic manner, or we could set n = 1 and the equation does not satisfy given equations, however all given factor set properties may do otherwise; Hence $f(5) = 25$ and so $f(2) = 4, f(5) = 25,$ and $f(3) = 9.$\n\nNow if $f(1) = 1,$ we cannot have $f(15)$ as $1 * f(15) > 15$ according to (ii), but if we apply the equation from (ii) in reverse, then $f(mn) = f(mn) - 15^1 = f(15)$ does not apply as $15^2 - 1 = 10$ and $10 > 1$, yet $15 > 5$ is not allowed according to (iii) properties, which contradicts in reverse function operator, so we must have $f(15) > 15$ and in order to have function operator unite in multifactor operator, we must have $15^1 = f(3) - 1^4$, but we have $f(6) = 12^2 = 144 f^2(2),f(5) = 25 f(1) = 25^2 - 123 = 20$ does not hold. So then if $10^4 = 120^2$, we cannot have G=1 as G must be f(5) and G = f(3) since 10 and 3 each have values less than f(5). Therefore it follows that if $f(1) = 1, f(m) = 1^m = G^m$ must not hold and f(m) would be valued Gf(m) and since $f(3) = 9,f(2) = 4,f(5) = 25,f(6) = 144,$ has increasing value in our case, let $f(m) = G^m$ be in function operator, and since function is increasing operator, then if we plot the given G terms we get : \n$\n115,  G, 5 G, 4 G\\   \\rightarrow G^1,  G^2,    G^3\n115 G^2,  G^4,      4 G^4,  \n$\n115 G^3,      G^3 G^4  G^4  \n$\n\nwhich values would be valued according to order of increasing G operator, as the properties given would devise the right values and each G operator values are $(1 + G)^m,$ has subsequent values that are results from $2^m$ factorized by the same operator factor we have in  variable values m which may hold in operator variable m as follows; As in multifactorial operator, function operator, if in multifactor operator, if we apply the equation operator, we obtain the multifactor operator, function operator, operator unite in multifactor operator is Gf(m) and we obtain subsequent : f(m) would be valued Gf(m), or we obtain in function operator, if we apply the equation operator, then unite the multifactorial Gf terms, then we devise : \nwe note if G operator valued according to multifactor operator, and G is the given operator, then G operator would devise the right values as $(1+5) \\rightarrow $(1 + G), we plot values of subsequent m in our case of the function as follows given in operator factorized by the same variable m factor factorized  variable values m as follows G which values valued in multifactorial operator m as follows : G  $m = 1$\n$\\begin{matrix}\n2 & & 5 & & 3 & & 2 & 5 \\\\\n\\downarrow & \\downarrow & \\downarrow & \\downarrow & \\downarrow & \\\\\n3 & & 25 & & 9 & & 20 & 25\n\\end{matrix}$"
