    "To find the positive value of $t$ that satisfies $ab = t-2i$, we will use the fact that the product of the magnitudes of two complex numbers is equal to the magnitude of their product. \n\nMathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n$|a||b| = |ab|$\n\nWe are given that $|a| = 2$ and $|b| = \\sqrt{26}$, so we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\n$2\\sqrt{26} = |ab|$\n\nSince $ab = t - 2i$, the magnitude of $ab$ can be found using the formula:\n\n$|ab| = \\sqrt{t^2 + (-2)^2}$\n\nCombining the equations, we get:\n\n$2\\sqrt{26} = \\sqrt{t^2 + 4}$\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root, we get:\n\n$4 \\cdot 26 = t^2 + 4$\n\n$104 - 4 = t^2$\n\n$t^2 = 100$\n\nTaking the positive square root of both sides to find the value of $t$, we get:\n\n$t = 10$\n\nSo, the positive value of $t$ that satisfies $ab = t-2i$ is $\\boxed{10}$.",
