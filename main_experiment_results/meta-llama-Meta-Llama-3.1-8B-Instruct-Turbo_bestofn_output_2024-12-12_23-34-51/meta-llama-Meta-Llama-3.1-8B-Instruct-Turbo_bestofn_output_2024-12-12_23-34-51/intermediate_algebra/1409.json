    "To find the range of the function $f(x) = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1},$ we want to determine the set of all possible $y$ values that $f(x)$ can take.\n\nWe'll begin by letting $y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}.$ Our goal is to find the values of $y$ for which this equation has real solutions.\n\nTo proceed, we multiply both sides of the equation by $x^2-x+1$ to obtain\n\n$$y(x^2-x+1)=x.$$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to get\n\n$$yx^2-yx+x=y.$$\n\nWe can rearrange it further to get\n\n$$yx^2-(y+1)x+y=0.$$\n\nNotice that this is a quadratic equation in $x$, and it has the form $ax^2+bx+c=0.$\n\nFor this quadratic equation to have real solutions, we must have $b^2-4ac \\geq 0$. Applying this to our original equation $x^2-(y+1)x+y=0,$ we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\nb^2-4ac &\\geq 0 \\\\\n(-y-1)^2 - 4(1)(y) &\\geq 0 \\\\\n(y+1)^2 - 4y &\\geq 0 \\\\\ny^2 + 2y + 1 - 4y &\\geq 0 \\\\\ny^2 - 2y + 1 &\\geq 0 \\\\\n(y-1)^2 &\\geq 0.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe expression $(y-1)^2 \\geq 0$ is true for all $y$ in the real numbers. This means that there are no restrictions on the values that $y$ can take. Since $y$ can be any real number, the range of $f$ is the set of all real numbers.\n\nTherefore, the range of the function is \\boxed{(-\\infty, \\infty)}.",
    "To find the range of the function, we need to determine all possible values that the function can output, given any real number input.\n\nStep 1: We can start by setting $y$ as the output of the function, and then expressing $y$ in terms of $x$.\n\nWe have $y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}$.\n\nStep 2: Our goal is to find the range of $y$, so we'll manipulate this equation to obtain a quadratic equation, which can be expressed in the standard form $Ax^2+Bx+C=0$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constants.\n\nWe'll do this by multiplying both sides by the denominator and rearranging:\n\n$y(x^2-x+1) = x$\n\nStep 3: Expanding and rearranging the equation:\n\n$yx^2-yx+y = x$\n\n$yx^2-(y+1)x+y = 0$.\n\nStep 4: This equation is a quadratic equation in $x$, which allows us to apply the quadratic formula. However, since $x$ can be any real number, our goal is to ensure that the equation $yx^2-(y+1)x+y=0$ has real solutions for any $y$ in its range.\n\nApplying the quadratic formula, we get: \n\\[x= \\frac{(y+1) \\pm \\sqrt{(y+1)^2 - 4y^2}}{2y}\\]\n\nStep 5: To ensure that the equation $yx^2-(y+1)x+y=0$ has real solutions, the discriminant must be nonnegative. This means we need to solve the inequality $(y+1)^2 - 4y^2 \\ge 0$. \n\nExpanding, we have:\n\\[(y+1)^2-4y^2 \\ge 0\\]\n\\[(y^2+2y+1)-4y^2 \\ge 0\\]\n\\[ -3y^2 + 2y +1 \\ge 0\\]\n\nWe can determine the discriminant of the above quadratic. This is given as: \\[ \\Delta = (2)^2- 4(-3)(1) \\]\n\\[ \\Delta = 4+12 \\]\n\\[ \\Delta = 16 \\]\n\nHence for this quadratic to be  ' greater than or equal to 0' ( the requirement for the discriminant), the discriminant value is greater than 0 \n\\[ (y^2- \\frac{2}{-3} +  \\frac{1}{-9}) \\ge  0 \\]\n We determine the roots of the ' greater than or equal to 0' expression to be: \n \\[ ( y  - \\frac{1}{3})^2 \\ge \\frac{-1}{9}\\]\nHowever, the value of \\[\\frac{-1}{9} \\] can be greater than zero \n  Thus we take this to determine our final 'range'.\n Step 6: Let's simplify and solve for $y$:\n\n \\[\\left( y  - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 \\ge \\frac{-1}{9}  \\]\n\nTaking the square roots on both sides: \\begin{align*}\n|y - \\frac{1}{3} | &\\ge \\frac{1}{3}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n Such that \n\\begin{align*}\ny- \\frac{1}{3} &\\ge \\frac{1}{3}\\\\\ny &\\ge  \\frac{2}{3} \\\\\ny &\\le -\\frac{1}{3}\n\\end{align*}\n\nHence the range of this function 'f' will be between the lower and upper bounds $ [{-\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{2}{3}}] $",
