    "To find the value of $\\left|\\frac{a+b}{a-b}\\right|$, we can start by using the given equation $a^2+b^2=8ab$. \n\nStep 1: Squaring the expression $\\frac{a+b}{a-b}$.\nSince we are trying to find $\\left|\\frac{a+b}{a-b}\\right|$, we can square this expression, as we know that $\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^2 = \\frac{a^2}{b^2}$ when a and b are nonzero.\nSo, let's proceed to square the given expression $\\frac{a+b}{a-b}$. \n\n$\\left(\\frac{a+b}{a-b}\\right)^2 = \\frac{(a+b)^2}{(a-b)^2}$.\n\nStep 2: Expanding the numerator and denominator of the fraction.\nNow, let's expand the numerator and the denominator separately.\nThe numerator is $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.\nThe denominator is $(a-b)^2 = a^2 -2ab + b^2$.\n\nStep 3: Substitute the value of $a^2 +b^2$ into the expressions for the numerator and the denominator.\nSince we are given $a^2+b^2 = 8ab$, we can substitute this value into the expanded expressions.\nThe numerator becomes $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a^2+b^2) + 2ab = 8ab + 2ab = 10ab$.\nThe denominator becomes $a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a^2+b^2) - 2ab = 8ab - 2ab = 6ab$.\n\nStep 4: Substitute the simplified expressions into the fraction.\nNow that we have the simplified expressions for the numerator and the denominator, we can substitute them into the fraction.\n$\\left(\\frac{a+b}{a-b}\\right)^2 = \\frac{(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)}{(a^2 - 2ab + b^2)} = \\frac{10ab}{6ab}$.\n\nStep 5: Cancel out common terms and simplify the fraction.\nSince $ab$ is nonzero (as both $a$ and $b$ are given to be nonzero), we can cancel $ab$ from the numerator and the denominator.\n$\\frac{10ab}{6ab} = \\frac{10}{6} = \\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nHowever, we must now simplify the square root $\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{3}}$.\nBut wait! The final result = (since we will have non-negative values inside both the numerator and denominator when we take square roots, which when squared result in the positive variation when their roots are taken):\n$\\left(\\frac{a+b}{a-b}\\right) = \\pm \\ = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{3}}$ \nThat said it was not our goal. We needed $| \\cdot |$. So $\\left|\\frac{a+b}{a-b}\\right| = \\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{3}}}$",
    "To find the value of $\\left|\\frac{a+b}{a-b}\\right|$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. We are given $a^2 + b^2 = 8ab$. \n\n2. First, notice that $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$. \n\n3. Also, $a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab$.\n\n4. We can simplify the equation $a^2 + b^2 = 8ab$ to get $a^2 + b^2 + 2ab = 10ab$ by adding $2ab$ to both sides of the equation.\n\n5. Similarly, we can simplify the equation $a^2 + b^2 = 8ab$ to get $a^2 + b^2 - 2ab = 6ab$ by subtracting $2ab$ from both sides of the equation.\n\n6. Now, substitute the expressions of $(a + b)^2$ and $(a - b)^2$ into the inequalities from step 4 and 5 respectively.\n\n7. From step 4 and 6, we can see that $(a + b)^2 = 10ab$. \n\n8. From step 5 and 6, we can see that $(a - b)^2 = 6ab$.\n\n9. Therefore, since we are looking for $\\left|\\frac{a+b}{a-b}\\right|$ we take the square root of both sides on $(a + b)^2 = 10ab$.\n\n10. $\\left| \\frac{a+b}{a-b} \\right| =  \\sqrt { \\frac{(a + b)^2}{(a-b)^2}}$\n\n11.

    "To find the value of $\\left|\\frac{a+b}{a-b}\\right|$, we need to start by using the given condition $a^2+b^2=8ab$.\n\nFirst, let's try to express the numerator and denominator in terms of $a$ and $b$. \n\nThe numerator can be expressed as:\n$(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$\n\nThe denominator can be expressed as:\n$(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the original equation as a difference of squares:\n$(a+b)^2 - (a-b)^2 = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) - (a^2 - 2ab + b^2)$\n\nExpanding and simplifying the expression:\n$a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - a^2 + 2ab - b^2 = 4ab$\n\nThis simplifies to $4ab = 4ab$, which holds true. However, we can use this to express $(a+b)^2 - (a-b)^2 = 4ab$ and factor it:\n$((a+b)+(a-b))((a+b)-(a-b)) = 4ab$\n\nThen apply simple algebra: \n$(a+b)+(a-b) = 2a$\n$(a+b)-(a-b) = 2b$\n\nSo we have:\n$(2a)(2b) = 4ab$\nWhich, also holds.\n\nNow, consider our main goal: express $| \\frac{a+b}{a-b} |$. The only thing left, seeing we are already on this track, is:\n$(a+b+a-b) = 2a$\n$(a+b-a+b) = 2b$\n$a+b = 2a$, therefore $b = a+a-b$ therefore $b = 2a-b$, therefore $2b = 2a$, therefore $b = a$. \n\nAnother approach: We can see that $(a+b)^2-(a-b)^2 = a^2 -b^2$\nHence, $4ab = a^2-b^2$\n\nWhich is the exact same as: $a^2 + 2ab = a^2 - 2ab$, from before.\n\nOr   $a^2 -b^2 = a^2 -b^2 + 4ab$\n\nWhich, simplifies,  into:\n$4ab = a^2 - b^2$\n\nUsing $a^2 + 2ab = a^2 - 2ab$, we can see $4ab = 2b(a+b)$\nHence, solving for $\\frac{a+b}{a-b}$, we have:\n$\\left|\\frac{a+b}{a-b}\\right|$ = $\\left|\\frac{2ab}{-2ab} \\right|$ = $\\left|\\frac{2ab}{2ab}\\times (-1)\\right|$ \nor\n$\\left|\\frac{2ab}{(2b)(a+b)}\\right|$  *   $\\left|  \\frac{2b}{2b}\\times \\frac{-(a+b)}{-a+b} \\right|  $   so  $\\left|\\frac{2a}{2}\\right|  =\\left|\\frac{a}{1}\\right|$"
