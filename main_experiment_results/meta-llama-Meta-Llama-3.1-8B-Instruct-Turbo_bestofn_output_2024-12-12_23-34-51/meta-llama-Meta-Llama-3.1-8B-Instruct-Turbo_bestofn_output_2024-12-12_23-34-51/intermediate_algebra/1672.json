    "To find the range of the function $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. The domain of the function is $[0,\\infty)$. This tells us that the input, $x$, can take any value greater than or equal to zero.\n\n2. The function $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$ is a polynomial function, which means it is continuous and differentiable everywhere in its domain.\n\n3. The function can be rewritten as $q(x) = (x^2 + 2)^2$. This is the vertex form of a quadratic function, which is a type of parabola.\n\n4. Since the function is a parabola, it has a minimum value when $x = 0$. Plugging in $x = 0$, we get $q(0) = (0^2 + 2)^2 = 4$.\n\n5. Since $x$ is greater than or equal to zero, the value of $x^2$ is at least $0$. The larger the value of $x$, the larger the value of $x^2$.\n\n6. Substituting the value of $x^2$ in the expression $(x^2 + 2)^2$, we get a value that is at least $4$.\n\n7. To find the range, we can determine the lower and upper bounds. From the previous step, we know that the minimum value of the function is $4$. There is no upper bound, since as $x$ increases, the value of the function increases without bound.\n\n8. Therefore, the range of the function $q(x)$ is the set of all values greater than or equal to $4$.\n\nSo, the range of the function is $\\boxed{[4,\\infty)}$.",
    "To find the range of the function $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$, we need to determine the minimum value it can take for all possible values of $x$ in its domain $[0,\\infty)$.\n\nSince the function $q(x)$ involves only even powers of $x$, it is a non-decreasing function for $x \\geq 0$. Therefore, we can find its minimum value at the lower bound of the domain, which is $x = 0$.\n\nWhen $x = 0$, we have:\n\n$q(0) = (0)^4 + 4(0)^2 + 4$\n$= 0 + 0 + 4$\n$= 4$\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the function is 4, and since it is a non-decreasing function, the maximum value of the function is unbounded as $x$ increases. However, since the function is also a polynomial with degree 4, it must always be greater than or equal to 4.\n\nHence, the range of the function $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$ is $[4,\\infty)$.\n\n$\\boxed{[4,\\infty)}$",
    "To find the range of the function $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$, we can first factor the expression as a perfect square.\n\n$q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$\n\nThis can be factored as follows:\n \n$q(x) = (x^2)^2 + 2(x^2)(2) + (2)^2$\n\nThis is a perfect square of the form $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ where $a = x^2$ and $b = 2$. \n\n$q(x) = (x^2 + 2)^2$\n\nNow that we have factored this expression, we know that the minimum value of $x^2$ is 0 and the maximum value of $x^2$ is infinity. \n\nAs we are squaring $(x^2 + 2)$, the minimum value of $x^2 + 2$ will be 2 and the maximum value of $x^2 + 2$ will be infinity.\n\nSo, the minimum value of $q(x)$ is $2^2 = 4$ and the maximum value of $q(x)$ is infinity.\n\nTherefore, the range of the function $q(x)$ is $[4, \\infty)$.\n\n$\\boxed{[4, \\infty)}$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and arrive at the same conclusion: the range of the function q(x) is [4, \u221e).\n\nHowever, Solution 1 provides the most detailed and step-by-step explanation, making it the most comprehensive and easy to follow.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "We have $q(x) = (x^2+2)^2$. We wish to determine the set of all $y$ for which $q(x)=y$ has solutions. We must have $y\\ge 0$, since $q(x)$ is a square and squares are nonnegative. Under the assumption $y\\ge 0$, we have:\n$$\\begin{array}{r r@{~=~}l}\n& y & (x^2+2)^2 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & \\sqrt y & x^2+2 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & \\sqrt y-2 & x^2 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$We see that $\\sqrt y-2\\ge 0$ because squares are nonnegative. Thus, we need $y\\ge 4$. When $y\\ge 4$, we have $y=q(x)$ by setting $x$ equal to either of $\\pm \\sqrt{\\sqrt y-2}$, and so any $y\\ge 4$ can be achieved.\n\nTherefore, the range of $q(x)$ is $\\boxed{[4,\\infty)}$.",
