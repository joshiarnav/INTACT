    "To find the median of the set, we need to first understand the relationship between $a$ and $b$ given the equation $ab^2 = \\log_{10} b$. \n\nSince $b$ is a positive number, and $\\log_{10} b > 0$, $ab^2$ must be greater than 0 for the equation to be valid. This implies that $a > 0$ if $b = 1$, as $b^2$ will also be 1. However, since $b$ can be any positive number, we must consider the case when $0 < b < 1$ and the case when $b > 1$ separately.\n\nWhen $0 < b < 1$,  $b^2 < b$, and since $\\log_{10} b < 0$, we have $ab^2 < 0$, which means $a < 0$. Similarly, $\\frac{1}{b} > 1$ and since $\\log_{10} \\frac{1}{b} < 0$, we have $a \\frac{1}{b^2} < 0$, which again implies $a < 0$.\n\nWhen $b > 1$, we have $b^2 > b$, and since $\\log_{10} b > 0$, we have $ab^2 > 0$, which implies that $a > 0$.\n\nHowever, in either case ($0 < b < 1$ or $b > 1$), we find that $a$ is negative in the former and positive in the latter, while $b$ is less than or greater than 1, respectively, and $1/b$ is greater than or less than 1, respectively.\n\nNow considering the set $\\{0, 1, a, b, \\frac{1}{b}\\}$, since $a$ is negative when $0 < b < 1$, and $a$ is positive when $b > 1$, it follows that $a$ will always be the smallest element in the set when $0 < b < 1$, and $a$ will be the middle element in the set when $b > 1$. This is because in the latter case, $1$, $b$, and $\\frac{1}{b}$ are distinct and in increasing order, and $a$ fits right between $1$ and $b$ or $b$ and $\\frac{1}{b}$ if $b$ and $\\frac{1}{b}$ are swapped.\n\nHowever, for any $b > 1$, let us calculate it for an example value of $b > 1$ for instance, $b = 10$. \nGiven the value for b is $10$, substituting in for our variable, we get $a * 10^2 = \\log_{10} 10$. We solve for a:  $a = \\log_{10} 10 / 100$, hence in this instance a equals $0.0004342898$.\n\nUsing another example value of $b > 1$ for instance, $b = 2$. \nGiven the value for b is $2$, substituting in for our variable, we get $a * 2^2 = \\log_{10} 2$. We solve for a:  $a = \\log_{10} 2 / 4$, hence in this instance a equals $0.0005549066$ which is greater than $a$ in the first example.\n\nFor values of $b$ closer to $1$, $a$ becomes smaller but always positive.\n\nSo in the set $\\{0, 1, a, b, \\frac{1}{b}\\}$ for $0 < b < 1$, $a$ is the smallest element, and for $b > 1$, $a$ is the median element.\n\nSince the set has an odd number of elements, the median will be the middle element when ordered, which is $a$. \n\nHowever, this would require $a$ not to be 0. Given the relationship of $b$ and $a$, it seems that $a = 0$ would be impossible, because, if $a$ were $0$, then $0 * b^2 = \\log_{10} b$ would imply $b^2 = \\log_{10} b$. Now, let us check this against all $b$ which are greater than 0 but less than or equal to 1. Solving $x^2 = x$ yields solutions of x = 0 and x = 1. Now, we have that, $0< b \\leq 1$ and if $b$ equals $1$, we get $0 * 1^2 = \\log_{10} 1$, which implies $0 = 0$. This condition is always satisfied. Now, $0 < b < 1$ implies  $0< b^2 < 1$ but that $0 < \\log_{10} b < 0$ because b < 1. Here, it follows that $b^2 \\neq \\log_{10} b$ when 0 < b  < 1. The conclusion is $a$ is strictly greater than zero for non-zero $b$ because $a = \\frac{\\log_{10}b}{b^2}$ when $b<1$ (and $b>1$ which we will not need).\n\nNow that we have found that $a$ is greater than zero for nonzero $b$, let us examine the set $\\{0, 1, a, b, \\frac{1}{b}\\}$ ordered for nonzero $b$.\nIn ordering the set from least to largest for nonzero $b$, $0$ is the least and $\\frac{1}{b}$ is the largest because $0 < 1 < a < b < \\frac{1}{b}$.\n\nNow considering that the set has an odd number of elements, the middle element or median is $a$. \n\nThus, the median of the set is $\\boxed{a}$",
    "To find the median of the given set, we first need to understand the properties of the given equation and how it affects the value of $b$.\n\nGiven equation: \n$ab^2 = \\log_{10} b$.\n\nSince $\\log_{10} b$ is defined only when $b$ is greater than 0, $b$ must be a positive number. \n\nAlso, since $b > 0$, $1/b > 0$. Thus, the number set $\\{0, 1, a, b,\n1/b\\}$ contains all positive numbers.\n\nHowever, we need to show that the set also contains the number 1. To do that, let's express $b$ in terms of $a$ using the given equation:\n\n$ab^2 = \\log_{10} b$\n\nSince $b$ is a positive number, we can express it as\n\n$b = e^{ab^2}$ (Here, $e$ is a base of the natural logarithm, $\\ln x = \\log_e x$).\n\nIf $a < 0$, then $ab^2 < 0$. Therefore, $b^2 > 1$ when $b > 1$ (if b is negative it would be $b^2 <1$) \nLet's consider $b > 1$. There exists some $c > 1$ such that $1 < c < b$. We can substitute $b^2$ in terms of $c$ as an intermediate value between 1 and $b^2$ in the equation $ab^2 = \\log_{10} b$ as follows:\n  \n$a*c = \\log_{10} c$\n\nHowever, given that \n\\begin{align*}\na*c &= \\log_{10} c \\\\\n\\Rightarrow a*c &= \\log_{10} (e^{ac})  \n\\end{align*}\nHence $e^{ac} = 10^c$\nSince $c > 1$ and given that the exponential function is increasing for all $x$, for any $c > 1$ where $c \\ne 10^{k}$, let k be a non zero integer, $10^c > 10$ \n\\begin{align*}\n\\Rightarrow   c\\ne \\log_{10} (10^c) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 10^c > c \\text{   for any given   }  c\\ne \\log_{10} (10^c)\\end{align*}\nAs $c > 1$, to ensure that \n$e^{ac} = 10^c $\n\nHence $a > 1$ is required. Therefore, $b > 1$ if $a > 1$.\n\nNow, consider the expression for $b$ given by\n\n$b = e^{ab^2}$\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Rightarrow b > 1 &\\text{ if } a > 1  \n\\end{align*}\nIn the set $\\{0, 1, a, b,1/b\\}$, since we know $b > 1$, \n$1/b <1$.\n\nThus, the set contains all the numbers $\\{0, 1, b, 1/b\\}$ and two variables, which are $\\{a\\}$ and the number that would form a 4 number subset set containing $\\{0, 1\\}$ with the number that is smaller than 1 which is \n$\\{1/b\\}$ and all three numbers $\\{0, 1, 1/b\\}$ are all smaller than or equal to 1 and one number $b$ is greater than 1.
