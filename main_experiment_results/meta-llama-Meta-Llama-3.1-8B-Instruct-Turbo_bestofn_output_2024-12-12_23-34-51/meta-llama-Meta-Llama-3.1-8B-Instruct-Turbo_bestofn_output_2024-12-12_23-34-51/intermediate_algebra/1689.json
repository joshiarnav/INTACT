    "To find the ordered triple $(a,b,c)$, we need to compare the graph of $y = g(x)$ with the graph of $y = f(x)$.\n\nFirstly, the transformation from $y = f(x)$ to $y = g(x)$ shows a horizontal shift to the right by a factor of $2$. This can be represented by $b = \\frac{1}{2}$, since a horizontal shift to the left or right is achieved by multiplying $x$ with a fraction less than $1$ or greater than $1$ respectively.\n\nSecondly, we notice that the graph of $y = g(x)$ is $4$ units below the graph of $y = f(x)$. This indicates a vertical shift down by $4$, but this vertical shift could also be considered a vertical compression by 1 and a shift down by 4. However, since $y = g(x)$ is lower than $y = f(x)$, we know there is a vertical shift down by $4$, which can be represented by $c = -4$.\n\nLastly, we can see that the amplitude of $y = g(x)$ is equal to the amplitude of $y = f(x)$, which means there is no vertical stretch or compression, indicating $a = 1$.\n\nSo, we have $(a, b, c) = (1, \\frac{1}{2}, -4)$."
