  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. However, Solution 1 and Solution 2 are more straightforward and clearly explain the concept of using the property that $|z^2| = |z|^2$. Solution 3 also correctly calculates the magnitude but does not explicitly state the property used.\n\nGiven the clarity and concision of the solutions, I would recommend Solution 1 as the best solution. \n\nTherefore, the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "Since $z^2 = 24-32i$, we must have $|z^2| = |24-32i| = |8(3-4i)| = 8|3-4i| = 8(5) = 40$.  We also have $|z|^2 = |z|\\cdot |z| = |(z)(z)| = |z^2|$, so $|z^2| = 40$ means that $|z|^2 = 40$, which gives us $|z| = \\sqrt{40} = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{10}}$.",
