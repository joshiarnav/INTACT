    "Given $2+\\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the equation $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10 = 0$, we need to find $b.$ \n\nStep 1: Since the coefficients are rational numbers, the conjugate of $2+\\sqrt{3}$, which is $2-\\sqrt{3}$, must also be a root of the equation.\n\nStep 2: Using Vieta's formula, the product of the roots of a polynomial is equal to $(-1)^n\\frac{c}{a}$ where $c$ is the constant term, $a$ is the leading coefficient, and $n$ is the number of roots. In this case, $n=3$, $c=10$, and $a=1.$ Since the product of the roots is equal to $\\frac{-10}{1}=-10$, and we have found two roots, we have\n\n\\[(2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3})(r_3)=-10,\\]\n\nwhere $r_3$ is the third root of the equation.\n\nStep 3: Simplifying the left-hand side of the above equation, we get\n\\[(2-\\sqrt{3})(2+\\sqrt{3})(r_3)=-10.\\]\n\nStep 4: The expression $(2-\\sqrt{3})(2+\\sqrt{3})$ simplifies to $2^2-(\\sqrt{3})^2=4-3=1.$  Therefore,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(2-\\sqrt{3})(2+\\sqrt{3})(r_3)&=-10\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 1\\cdot r_3&=-10\\\\\n\\Rightarrow r_3&=-10\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nStep 5: Now we can use Vieta's formulas to find $b$. According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of products of the roots taken two at a time is equal to $b$, which is the coefficient of the $x$-term in the polynomial.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nr_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + r_2 r_3 &= b\\\\\n(2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3}) + (2+\\sqrt{3})(-10) + (2-\\sqrt{3})(-10)&=b\\\\\n1 + (-20-\\sqrt{3}\\cdot10) + (-20+\\sqrt{3}\\cdot10)&=b\\\\\n1-20-10\\sqrt{3}+20-10\\sqrt{3}&=b\\\\\n1-20-20\\sqrt{3}&=b\\\\\nb&=1-20-20\\sqrt{3}=-20-20\\sqrt{3}-20\\\\\nb&=-20-20(\\sqrt{3}+1)\\\\\nb&=-20-20(1+\\sqrt{3})\\\\\nb&=-20-20\\cdot 1 -20\\cdot \\sqrt{3} \\\\\nb&=-20-20-20\\sqrt{3}\\\\\nb&= -40 -20\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nHowever, since the provided format was specified we would need to simplify it further or make it an integer if possible, yet as is, $b$ is expressed in exact form.",
    "To find the value of $b$, we can first use the fact that $2+\\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the equation to find the quadratic that has this root and its conjugate as roots. Then we can use the fact that this quadratic times the linear factor containing the third root must equal the original cubic.\n\nStep 1: First, we can recognize that since $2+\\sqrt{3}$ is a root, its conjugate $2-\\sqrt{3}$ must also be a root. We will find the quadratic that has these roots.\n\nTo construct the quadratic from two roots, we can use the formula for a quadratic with roots $r_1$ and $r_2$: $(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$.\n\nUsing the roots $2+\\sqrt{3}$ and $2-\\sqrt{3}$, the quadratic will be:\n\\[(x-(2+\\sqrt{3}))(x-(2-\\sqrt{3})) = (x-2-\\sqrt{3})(x-2+\\sqrt{3}) = (x-2)^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = (x-2)^2 -3 = x^2 -4x + 4 -3 = x^2-4x+1.\\]\n\nStep 2: The other root of the cubic must be the root of the equation in the above quadratic times a linear factor, in the form $(x-c)$. Let the third root be $c$. So, the cubic will be $(x^2 -4x+1)(x-c)$. We can now multiply the quadratics to get:\n\\[(x^2-4x+1)(x-c) = x^3-(c-4)x^2+(4c-4)x-c.\\]\n\nStep 3: The coefficients in the above equation must be equal to $a$ and $b$ from the original equation in the problem statement. The original equation is in the form $x^3+ax^2+bx+c = 0$. Therefore, we can compare the coefficients from the original equation with the coefficients from the above equation to find the value of $b$.\n\nSince in the above equation $(x^2-4x+1)(x-c) = x^3-(c-4)x^2+(4c-4)x-c$, we can equate the coefficients to be as follows: \n- The constant term in the above equation must be the constant term in the original equation: $-c=10$, so $c=-10$.\n- The coefficient of $x^2$ in the above equation must be $a$: \n\\[-(c-4) = a,\\] so we replace $c$ with $-10$: \n\\[a=10-(-4) = 10+4 = 14.\\]\n- To find the value of $b$ from the above equation, compare the coefficient of $x$ with the coefficient of $x$ in the original equation:\n\\begin{align*}  \n    b&=\\text{coefficient of }x\\text{ from the above equation}\\\\\n    b&=(4c-4)\\\\\n    b&=(4(-10)-4)\\\\\n    b&=(-40-4)\\\\\n    b&=\\boxed{-44} \\end{align*}\nThe answer $b=-44$.",
    "To find the value of $b$, we'll use the fact that if $2+\\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the given equation, then its conjugate $2-\\sqrt{3}$ is also a root of the equation.\n\nSince the coefficients of the polynomial are rational, the irrational roots must come in conjugate pairs. So if $r+s\\sqrt{t}$ is a root, then $r-s\\sqrt{t}$ must also be a root.\n\nThe factors of the given polynomial corresponding to the roots $2+\\sqrt{3}$ and $2-\\sqrt{3}$ are:\n\n\\[(x-(2+\\sqrt{3}))(x-(2-\\sqrt{3}))=x^2-4x+1\\]\n\nThis quadratic factor has the two conjugate roots $2+\\sqrt{3}$ and $2-\\sqrt{3}$. \n\nNow, by the Factor Theorem, we can multiply this quadratic factor with the remaining linear factor (which we'll denote as $x+c$) to obtain the original cubic polynomial. The constant term of the linear factor is the constant term we'd multiply with 1 (our constant term of the quadratic) to get the constant term of the cubic, which is 10, so:\n\n\\[(x^2-4x+1)(x+c)=x^3+(c-4)x^2+(1-4c)x+c\\]\n\nFrom here we can equate coefficients between the given polynomial and our cubic polynomial, to find the values of $a$ and $c$ ($c=a-4$). Since we only need to find $b$, we can ignore the values of $a$ and $c$ for now, because our cubic polynomial is $x^3 + (a-4)x^2+(1-4(a-4))x+(a-4)$.\n\nComparing the cubic terms, we see that $a = 1$. Now we can write the cubic polynomial as $x^3+x^2+(1-16+4a-16)x+(a-4)$.\n\nComparing the constant terms, we see that $a-4 = 10$ which is true, hence $a=14$. Now we can write the cubic polynomial as $x^3+x^2-1-4a+4(x)+1$.\n\nThen 1-4+4 = 1. \nComparing the coefficient of  $x$  between  the given polynomial and  the  cubic polynomial,  we  find:\n\n$-1-4(a)-16  = b$\n\n\n 1. enter the correct value of a = 14\n 2.  enter 1-4a-16 = -51\n\n\n\n  $-1-4(a)-16 = b$\n  $- 1 - 56  =  b $\n  $  b= - 57$"
