    "To determine the graph of $y=(f+g)(x)$, let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\nThe original parabola has the equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$. When this parabola is reflected about the $x$-axis, the new parabola is given by the equation $y=-ax^2-bx-c$. \n\nWhen these two parabolas are translated five units horizontally in opposite directions, the parabolas become $y_1=f(x)=a(x-5)^2+b(x-5)+c$ and $y_2=g(x)=a(x+5)^2+b(x+5)+c$. The sum of these two equations represents the graph of $y=(f+g)(x)$.\n\nSo, we need to find the sum of the two equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= (f+g)(x) \\\\\n&= a(x-5)^2 + a(x+5)^2 + b(x-5) + b(x+5) + c\\\\\n&= a(x^2-10x+25) + a(x^2+10x+25) + b(x-5) + b(x+5) + c\\\\\n&= 2ax^2+20a + 2bx\\\\\n&= 2ax^2 + 20a + 2bx\n\\end{align*}\n\nThis is an equation of a parabola, but it does not touch the $x$-axis as the terms $20a$ and $2bx$ contribute to the $y$-intercept. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer, a parabola not tangent to the $x$-axis.\n\n\\boxed{B}",
    "To understand how the transformation affects the parabola, let's first reflect a general parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ about the $x$-axis. This results in the equation $y=-ax^2-bx-c$. \n\nNow, after reflection, we translate the original parabola and its reflection $5$ units in opposite directions. The parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ will become $y=a(x-5)^2+b(x-5)+c$, and the reflected parabola $y=-ax^2-bx-c$ will become $y=-a(x+5)^2-b(x+5)-c$.\n\nThe sum of these two functions, $(f+g)(x)$, is\n\\begin{align*}\n(f+g)(x)&=a(x-5)^2+b(x-5)+c+-a(x+5)^2-b(x+5)-c\\\\\n&=a(x^2-10x+25)+b(x-5)+c+-a(x^2+10x+25)-b(x+5)-c\\\\\n&=ax^2-10ax+25a+bx-5b+c-ax^2-10ax-25a-bx-5b-c\\\\\n&=-20ax-10b\n\\end{align*}\n\nNotice that the result of the sum is a linear function, which means it's a non-horizontal line.\n\n$\\boxed{(D)}$",
    "To solve this, let's first consider the parabola and its reflection about the x-axis. The equation of the parabola is $y = ax^2 + bx + c$. When reflected across the x-axis, the new equation becomes $y = -ax^2 - bx - c$.  \n\nNow, the parabola is translated five units horizontally to the right to become the graph of $y = f(x)$, and the reflection is translated five units horizontally to the left to become the graph of $y = g(x)$. This is represented by shifting the functions in the equation $x$ is replaced by $x-5$ for the right translation and $x+5$ for the left translation.\n\nThus, for the right translation, \n$y = f(x) = a(x-5)^2 + b(x-5) + c$.\n\nExpanding $(x-5)^2$ as $x^2-10x+25$, \n$a(x-5)^2 + b(x-5) + c = a(x^2-10x+25) + b(x-5) + c = ax^2-10ax+25a + bx-5b+c$.\n\nFor the left translation,\n$y = g(x) = -a(x+5)^2 - b(x+5) - c$.\n\nExpanding $(x+5)^2$ as $x^2+10x+25$, \n$-a(x+5)^2 - b(x+5) - c = -a(x^2 +10x+25) - b(x+5) - c = -ax^2 -10ax -25a - bx - 5b - c$.\n\nWhen we add $(f+g)(x)$, the resulting function would combine the like terms in both equations $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ into a new equation.\n\nSince the like $ax^2$ terms combine to $0$. That was the only unique case of a like-term pairing with opposing coefficients. The constant terms from both equations $25a + c$ and $-25a - c$ would also cancel each other out when added. The resulting function $(f+g)(x) = -20ax -10b - 5b$\n\nThis new equation simplifies to $-20ax - 15b$. \n\nThere is no \"$2*15b$\" in the equation $(f+g)(x) = -20ax -10b - 5b$. This implies that the $b$ term (-10b) does combine with (-5b) to be $(-15b)$ making the equation correct.\n\nSince there is no $bx^2$ term present in the resulting equation, the graph must be a non-horizontal line (since it must pass through at least one point with a non-zero y-coordinate), since $-20ax$ has an $x$ term which is needed for any line that isn't horizontal.\n\nThus the correct answer is: $\\boxed{(D)}$"
