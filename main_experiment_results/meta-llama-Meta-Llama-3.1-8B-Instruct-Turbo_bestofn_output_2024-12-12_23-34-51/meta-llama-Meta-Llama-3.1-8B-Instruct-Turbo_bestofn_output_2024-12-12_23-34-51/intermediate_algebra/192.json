    "To find the horizontal asymptote of the given function, we need to examine the behavior of the function as $x$ approaches positive or negative infinity. The constant term in the numerator and denominator dominate this behavior. \n\nGiven function: $f(x) = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}$\n\nFor large $x$, the $x^2$ term in both numerator and denominator dominates. We can rewrite the function to reflect this:\n\n$f(x) \\approx \\frac{2x^2}{x^2}$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$f(x) \\approx 2$\n\nThis means that as $x$ approaches positive or negative infinity, the function $f(x)$ approaches 2, and the horizontal asymptote is at $y=2$.\n\nNow, we want to find where the function crosses this horizontal asymptote, which is at $y=2$. To find this point, we need to set the function $f(x)$ equal to 2 and solve for $x$.\n\n$\\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1} = 2$\n\nWe can multiply both sides of the equation by $x^2 - 4x + 1$ to get rid of the fraction.\n\n$2x^2 - 5x - 7 = 2(x^2 - 4x + 1)$\n\nExpand the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n$2x^2 - 5x - 7 = 2x^2 - 8x + 2$\n\nNow, subtract $2x^2$ from both sides of the equation to get:\n\n$-5x - 7 = -8x + 2$\n\nNow add $8x$ to both sides:\n\n$3x - 7 = 2$\n\nNext, add 7 to both sides of the equation:\n\n$3x = 9$\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3 to find the value of $x$:\n\n$x = \\boxed{3}$",

  "solution": "The horizontal asymptote of $f$ is the horizontal line that $f$ approaches as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. When the leading terms of the numerator and denominator have the same degree, that line is at the value equal to the ratio of the leading coefficients, namely $y = 2/1 = 2$.
