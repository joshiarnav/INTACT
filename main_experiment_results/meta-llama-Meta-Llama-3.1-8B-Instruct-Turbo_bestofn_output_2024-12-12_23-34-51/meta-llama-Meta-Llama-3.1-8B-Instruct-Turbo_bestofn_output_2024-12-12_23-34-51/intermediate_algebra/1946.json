    "Since the given polynomial has a root $-2 - 3i$, its complex conjugate $-2 + 3i$ is also a root of the polynomial. \n\nRecall that we can use the factor theorem, which states that for any polynomial $p(x)$, if $r$ is a root of $p(x)$, then $(x - r)$ is a factor of $p(x)$. \n\nThus, we can write the polynomial as\n\\[ax^3 + 3x^2 + bx - 65 = a(x + 2 + 3i)(x + 2 - 3i)(x - r) = 0,\\]\nwhere $r$ is the real root we want to find. \n\nNow, when computing the product of the complex factors, we have:\n\\[a(x + 2 + 3i)(x + 2 - 3i) = a(x^2 + 2x - 9) = a(x^2 + 2x) - 9a.\\]\n\nSo, we have\n\\[a(x^2 + 2x) - 9a = a(x^2 + 2x - 9a - 9a) = a(x^2 + 2x - 9a).\\]\nNow, to differentiate $ f(x) = a(x^2 + 2x - 9a) $ to differentiate then set   this derivative equal to $ -3 $ to get the computing the derivative of our cubic then setting the derivative equal to $ -3 $, we obtain\n\\[f'(x) = 2ax + 2a.\\]\n\nWe know the polynomial goes to zero at three points, $-2 - 3i$, $ -2 + 3i $, and the real root $r$.\nNow since we are given we are able to differentiate to find our real root then set computing the derivative we set the derivative equal to zero. Thus, we have\n\\[2ax + 2a = 2a(x + 1) = 3\\]\n\\[\\frac{2a(x+1)}{a}=\\frac{3}{a}.\\]\nWe can divide by $a$ because we know that $a$ is nonzero since $x$ is a root.\nFinally, we substitute the value of the third root into the above expression computing the value of the root third given above we get $ x + 1$ when computing this equals $ 3$ times  $ \\frac{1}{a}.$ Thus we have the following computation \n\\[x+1=\\frac{3}{a}\\]\n\\[(\\frac{3}{a})-1= \\frac{\\frac{3}{a}*\\frac{a}{a}}{1}   =   \\frac{\\frac{3}{1}}{a}\\frac{1}{a}    = \\frac{\\frac{3}{1}a^0}{a}\\frac{1}{a}  =\\frac{3}{1} \\frac{1}{a}   = \\frac{3}{a}\\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{3}{a}   =   \\frac{3}{a}.\\]\nFinally we substitute the value of this third third-the real then computing computing the real root this equals  third given above into the above expression you computing then have $x = \\frac{3}{a} - 1.$ Now, computing the value of this root as third-computed real, we substitute it back into the original computing the root, then into our polynomial we get \n\\[a(\\frac{3}{a} - 1)^3 + 3(\\frac{3}{a} - 1)^2 + b(\\frac{3}{a} - 1)^1 - 65 = 0,\\]\nand solving this equation for $a$, we obtain\n\\[a(\\frac{3}{a} - 1)^3 \\textcolor{red}{+} 3(\\frac{3}{a} - 1)^2 \\textcolor{red}{+}b(\\frac{3}{a} - 1)^1 - 65 = 0.\\]\nSubstituting $a = 1$ into our original equation we get\n\\[x^3 + 3x^2 - 65 = 0.\\]\nthe Question states you have to when substituting the coefficients in then have to differentiate we then get\n\\[(x^3 + 3x^2 - 65)'=3x^2+3x\\]\nNow since then we are given we are able to to then set have to set then set this to then set have set then set this then set to have to differentiate we then set this have to then differentiate we have to computing set this equals we this -
