    "To find the real numbers $k$ so that $f^{-1}(x) = f(x),$ we need to find the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ and then equate it to $f(x).$\n\nStep 1: Finding the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$\n\nTo find the inverse function $f^{-1}(x),$ we start with the function $f(x) = \\frac{2x + 3}{kx -

kxf(x)x = 3x$\nIt would be more convenient to group like terms\n$-kx^2 + x(k - 3) - kxf(x)x  = 0$\nsince multiplying both sides by $kxf(x)$ turns everything but $x$  into  a multiple of $x$\n\n$kx^2  -
