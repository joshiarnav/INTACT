    "To find the equation of the other asymptote of the hyperbola, we can use the given information that one of the asymptotes has the equation $y = 3x,$ and the foci have the same $x-$coordinate, which is $5.$\n\nSince the hyperbola has a vertical axis of symmetry, the center of the hyperbola is also the midpoint of the foci. Let's call the midpoint of the foci $(5, y_{center}).$ We know that the center of the hyperbola lies on both asymptotes. Given the equation of the first asymptote is $y = 3x,$ we can substitute $x = 5$ into the equation to find the $y-$coordinate of the center.\n\n$y = 3x$\n$y = 3 \\times 5$\n$y = 15$\n\nSo, the center of the hyperbola is $(5, 15).$\n\nNow, we know that the slopes of the asymptotes are negatives of each other. Let the slope of the second asymptote be $m.$ The equation of the second asymptote is $y = mx + b.$\n\nSince the slopes of the two asymptotes are negatives of each other, we can write $m = -3.$ The equation of the second asymptote becomes $y = -3x + b.$\n\nNow, we can substitute the coordinates of the center $(5, 15)$ into the equation to find the value of $b.$\n\n$15 = -3 \\times 5 + b$\n$15 = -15 + b$\n$b = 30$\n\nNow, we can write the equation of the second asymptote as $y = -3x + 30.$ \n\nSo, the equation of the other asymptote of the hyperbola is $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}$.",
    "Since the foci have the same x-coordinate and the asymptotes intersect at the center, the center of the hyperbola must also lie on the line x = 5.\n\nThe asymptotes are perpendicular to each other if the hyperbola is a rectangle hyperbola. In that case the slopes of the asymptotes must be negative reciprocals of each other.\n\nHowever, in this problem, the slopes are positive reciprocals of each other. Therefore, the asymptotes must intersect each other at the center. Therefore, we can find the point where the asymptotes intersect by solving the system of equations:\n\ny = 3x and y = 3(5) = 15\n\n\nThe point of intersection is at (5,15).\n\nSince the center of the hyperbola is at (5,15) and the foci of the hyperbola have the same x-coordinate 5, the transverse axis is vertical. Therefore, the slopes of the asymptotes must be negative reciprocals of each other.\n\ny = 3x is one of the asymptotes, and the other asymptote must be of the form\n\ny - 15 = m(x-5)\n\nWe need to find the slope m.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 and rearrange the equation:\n\n-1/m * (y - 15) = x - 5\n\nm(y-15) = -(x-5)\n\nm(x-15) + (15-y) = x - 5\n\ny - 15 = - (1/m) * (x - 5)\n\ny = - (1/m) * (x - 5) + 15\n\nm = -1 / 3\n\nSubstitute the value of m into the above equation:\n\ny = - (1/-1/3) * (x - 5) + 15\n\ny = (3) * (x - 5) + 15\n\ny = 3x - 15 + 15\n\ny = 3x\n\n\nThe above equation is the same as the first equation. It seems we have made an error. Let's start again.\n\nSince the slopes are positive reciprocals of each other, the slopes must be 3 and 1/3.\n\ny = 3x is one of the asymptotes, and the other asymptote must be of the form\n\ny = (1/3)x + b\n\nSubstitute the point (5,15) to solve for b:\n\n15 = (1/3) * 5 + b\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n45 = 5 + 3b\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\n40 = 3b\n\nDivide by 3:\n\nb = 13.333\n\nTherefore, the equation of the other asymptote in the form y = mx + b must be:\n\n\ny = (1/3)x + (40/3)\n\n\nSince b must be in the format answer boxed:\n\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{y = \\frac{1}{3}x+\\frac{40}{3}}$",
    "To find the equation of the other asymptote of the hyperbola, we need to understand the properties of hyperbolas and the relationship between the asymptotes and the foci.\n\nSince the foci of the hyperbola have the same x-coordinate, which is 5, this means that the transverse axis of the hyperbola is vertical. Also, given that one of the asymptotes is y = 3x, we can conclude that the center of the hyperbola is the point of intersection between the two asymptotes.\n\nLet's find the point where the asymptote y = 3x intersects the vertical line at x = 5. We can substitute x = 5 into the equation of the asymptote to get y = 3 * 5 = 15. Therefore, the center of the hyperbola is at (5, 15).\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the other asymptote, which is also a line passing through the center (5, 15). The slope of this new line will be the negative reciprocal of the slope of the known asymptote, which is -1/3.\n\nThe equation of the line with slope m passing through point (x1, y1) is:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nWe have m = -1/3, x1 = 5, and y1 = 15. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\ny - 15 = -1/3(x - 5)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation to the form y = mx + b:\n\ny = -1/3x + 20\n\nTherefore, the equation of the other asymptote of the hyperbola is:\n\n$\\boxed{y = -\\frac{1}{3}x + 20}$"

  "solution": "Because the foci both lie on the line $x=5$ and the center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the segment connecting the foci, the center must also lie on the line $x=5.$ However, we also know that the asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at the center.
