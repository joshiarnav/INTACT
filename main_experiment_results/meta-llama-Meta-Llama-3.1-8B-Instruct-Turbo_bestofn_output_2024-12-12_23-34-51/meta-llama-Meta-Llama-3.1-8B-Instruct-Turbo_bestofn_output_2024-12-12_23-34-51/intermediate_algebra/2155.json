    "To find the distance between the foci of the ellipse, we need to first put the given equation into the standard form for an ellipse. \n\n1. First, complete the square for $x$ terms:\n$16x^2 - 64x = 16(x^2 - 4x) = 16[(x^2 - 4x + 4) - 4] = 16(x-2)^2 - 64$\n\n2. Then, complete the square for $y$ terms:\n$y^2 + 4y = [y^2 + 4y + 4] - 4 = (y+2)^2 - 4$\n\n3. Substitute the results back into the equation and add 4 to both sides:\n$16(x-2)^2 - 64 + (y+2)^2 - 4 + 4 = 0$\nThis simplifies to:\n$16(x-2)^2 + (y+2)^2 - 64 = 0$\n$16(x-2)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 64$\n\n4. Divide the equation by 64 to get it into the standard form for an ellipse:\n$\\frac{(x-2)^2}{4} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{64} = 1$\n\nNow that the equation is in the standard form, we can identify the major and minor axes, and subsequently the distance from the center to the foci. \n\nSince $\\frac{64}{4} = 16 > 1$, we can conclude that the major axis is vertical.\n\nThe equation for an ellipse with a vertical major axis has the standard form:\n$\\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} = 1$\n\nIn this equation, the distance from the center to the foci is given by the formula: $c = \\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}$\nThe center of the ellipse is at the point $(h, k) = (2, -2)$.\n\nComparing this with the standard form from our ellipse, we have:\n$b^2 = 4$\n$a^2 = 64$\n\nNow we can find $c$:\n$c = \\sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 4} = \\sqrt{60} = 2\\sqrt{15}$\nThe distance between the foci is $2c$:\n$2c = 2 * 2\\sqrt{15} = 4\\sqrt{15}$\n\nSo the final answer is: $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{15}}$",
    "To find the distance between the foci of the ellipse, we need to first rewrite the equation in standard form. \n\nFirst, complete the squares for both $x$ and $y$ terms.\n\n- For the $x$ terms, we factor out 16 from the first two terms, then complete the square: \n  $16x^2 - 64x$ can be rewritten as $16(x^2-4x)$.\n  Completing the square for $x^2-4x$ gives $16(x^2-4x+(-4/2)^2)$ or $16(x^2-4x+4)$, which is $16(x-2)^2$.\n- For the $y$ terms, we have $y^2 + 4y$, which can be rewritten as $(y^2 + 4y + 2^2) - 2^2$, or $(y+2)^2 - 4$.\n\nNow, replace the non-standard terms with the completed squares and keep the constant terms:\n \\begin{align*}\n 16x^2 - 64x + y^2 + 4y + 4 &= 16(x^2 - 4x + 4) - 64 + (y^2 + 4y + 4) - 4 + 4\\\\\n 16(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 + 4y + 4) - 64 - 4 + 4 &= 0\\\\\n 16(x-2)^2 + (y+2)^2 - 64 &= 0\\\\\n 16(x-2)^2 + (y+2)^2 &= 64\n \\end{align*}\n\nNow we have the equation in non-standard form but without the $x$ term on the right-hand side. To get it in standard form, we need to divide the whole equation by $64$, so the right-hand side is 1. This will be our denominator:\n \\begin{align*}\n 16(x-2)^2 + (y+2)^2 &= 64\\\\\n \\frac{16(x-2)^2 + (y+2)^2}{64} &= \\frac{64}{64}\\\\\n \\frac{(x-2)^2}{4} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{64} &= 1\n \\end{align*}\n\nThe standard form is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1,\n\\end{align*} where:\n- $(h,k) = (-a, -b)$ in non-standard form, or $(2, -2)$ in this case.\n- $a = \\sqrt{a^2} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$, \n- $b = \\sqrt{b^2} = \\sqrt{64} = 8$\n\nFor an ellipse,  the equation relating $a$, $b$, and $c$ where $c$ is the distance between the center and the foci is $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$. In this case, because $b$ is larger than $a$, we need to use the absolute value of the difference of their squares.

For an ellipse,  a value of $b^2 > a^2$ should not happen. In this case, it is actually happening because the ellipse has been incorrectly assumed. Therefore, we must change the form of the ellipse.\n\nFor $16x^2 - 64x + y^2 + 4y + 4 = 0,$ we initially factored out the $16$ and completed the square with the correct coefficient. We should keep completing the square. \n\n \\begin{align*}\n 16(x^2 - 4x) + (y^2+4y)&=-4\\\\\n 16(x^2 - 4x+\\frac{(-4)}{2^2}) + (y^2 + 4y +2^2) -16-4 &= -4\\\\\n 16(x^2 - 4x +4) + (y^2 +4y + 4) -16-4 &= -4\\\\\n 16(x-2)^2 + (y+2)^2 &=16\n \\end{align*}\n\nDivide by 16, and we have \n \\begin{align*}\n \\frac{16(x-2)^2}{16} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{16} &= 1\\\\\n \\frac{(x-2)^2}{1} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{16} &= 1\n \\end{align*}\n\nThis form follows the standard ellipse form where:\n- $(h,k) = (2, -2)$.\n- $a^2 = 1$, so $a = \\sqrt{1} = 1$\n- $b^2 = 16$, so $b = \\sqrt{16} = 4$\n\nNow we can use the equation $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$ because $a^2$ is larger than $b^2$, and $b$ is smaller than $a$ as expected:\n \\begin{align*}\n c^2 = a^2 - b^2\n \\end{align*}\n\nSince $a^2$ and $b^2$ were such that $a^2 > b^2$, this should work this time with $a^2 = 16 > b^2 = 1$.

The correct calculation should be $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, but in this case, $b^2$ should be larger than $a^2$. However, the correct $a^2$ and $b^2$ values are $a^2 = 64$ and $b^2 = 4$. Therefore, the correct calculation is $c^2 = 64 - 4 = 60$, and $c = \\sqrt{60} = 2\\sqrt{15}$.\n\nSolution 3 is incorrect because it does not follow the standard procedure for completing the square and putting the equation in standard form. The correct standard form for an ellipse is $\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$, where $(h, k)$ is the center of the ellipse, and $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "solution": "Completing the square in $x$ and $y,$ we get\n\\[16(x - 2)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 64.\\]Then\n\\[\\frac{(x - 2)^2}{4} + \\frac{(y + 2)^2}{64} = 1.\\]Thus, $a = 8$ and $b = 2,$ so $c = \\sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = \\sqrt{60} = 2 \\sqrt{15}.$  Therefore, the distance between the foci is $2c = \\boxed{4 \\sqrt{15}}.$",
