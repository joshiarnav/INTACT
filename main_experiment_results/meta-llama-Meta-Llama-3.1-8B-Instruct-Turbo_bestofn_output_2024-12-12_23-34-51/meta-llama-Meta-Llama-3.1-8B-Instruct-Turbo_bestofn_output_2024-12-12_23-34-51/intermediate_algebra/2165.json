    "To find the remainder of the division, we will use the Remainder Theorem. The Remainder Theorem states that if we divide a polynomial $f(x)$ by $x - a$, the remainder is $f(a)$.\n\nHowever, in this case, our divisor is $2x - 6$. To apply the Remainder Theorem, we need to rewrite our divisor in the form of $x - a$. We can rewrite $2x - 6$ as $2(x - 3)$, so our divisor is equivalent to $x - 3$.\n\nNow that we have $x - 3$, we can apply the Remainder Theorem.\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of $a$, which is 3.\n\nThen, we plug $x = 3$ into the polynomial $6x^4-14x^3-4x^2+2x-26$.\n\nPlugging in $x = 3$, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\n6(3)^4 - 14(3)^3 - 4(3)^2 + 2(3) - 26\n& = 6(81) - 14(81) - 4(9) + 6 - 26\\\\\n& = 486 - 1134 - 36 + 6 - 26\\\\\n& = -702\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe remainder is then $\\boxed{-702}$.",

    "To find the remainder when $6x^4 - 14x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 26$ is divided by $2x - 6$, we can use polynomial long division or synthetic division, but in this case, we can also use the remainder theorem. \n\nThe remainder theorem states that if we divide a polynomial $f(x)$ by a linear factor of the form $(x - a)$ or in our case $(2x - 6)$, the remainder is $f(a)$.\n\nFirst, we need to rewrite $2x - 6$ in the form $x - a$. We can do this by dividing or simply subtracting 6 from both sides, giving us the equation $2x = 6$, which results in $x = 3$ when both sides are divided by 2.\n\nNow that we know $a = 3$, we can find the remainder by plugging $x = 3$ into the polynomial $6x^4 - 14x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 26$.\n\nLet's substitute $x = 3$ into the polynomial:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n   f(3) &= 6(3)^4 - 14(3)^3 - 4(3)^2 + 2(3) - 26\n\\end{aligned}$$\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n   f(3) &= 6(81) - 14(27) - 4(9) + 6 - 26\n\\end{aligned}$$\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n   f(3) &= 486 - 378 - 36 + 6 - 26\n\\end{aligned}$$\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n   f(3) &= -486 + 6 - 26 \\\\\n   f(3) &= -506\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $6x^4 - 14x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 26$ is divided by $2x - 6$ is $-506$, so the answer is $\\boxed{-506}$."
