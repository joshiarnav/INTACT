    "To find the slant asymptote of the rational expression, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator. This can be done using long division or synthetic division. \n\nIn this case, we can rewrite the numerator as a polynomial and the denominator as $x - 3$:\n \nNumerator: $2x^2 + 3x - 7$\nDenominator: $x - 3$\n\nDivide $2x^2 + 3x - 7$ by $x - 3$. The result is a quotient of $2x + 9$ and a remainder of $-26$. To write this in the form $y = mx + b$, we can combine the quotient and remainder:\n\ny = (2x + 9) - 26 / (x - 3)\n \nHowever, we can rewrite the result in a more simplified form:\n\n$y = 2x + 9 - \\frac{26}{x - 3}$\n\nAs x approaches $\\infty$ or $-\\infty$, the fraction $\\frac{26}{x - 3}$ approaches 0. Therefore, the slant asymptote of the rational expression is the line $y = 2x + 9$.\n\nTo find m + b, we substitute the values of m and b from $y = mx + b$:\n \nm + b = 2 + 9\nm + b = 11\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{11}$.",

    "To find the slant asymptote of the given rational expression, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator.

  "solution": "To approach this problem, we can either use long division or synthetic division to evaluate the quotient of the given rational expression.
