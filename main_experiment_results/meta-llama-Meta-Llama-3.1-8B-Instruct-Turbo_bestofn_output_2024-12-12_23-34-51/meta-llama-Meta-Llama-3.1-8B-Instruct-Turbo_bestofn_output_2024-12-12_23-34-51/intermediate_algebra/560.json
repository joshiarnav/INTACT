    "To solve this problem, we can break it down into two steps. \n\nStep 1: Find $c$ for the ellipse and the hyperbola. \n\nFor the ellipse with the equation \\[\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\] with foci at $(0,\\pm c),$ we have that $c = 4.$ \n\nFor the hyperbola with the equation \\[\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\] with foci at $(\\pm c, 0),$ we have that $c = 6.$ \n\nSince the $c$ values for both the ellipse and the hyperbola are determined by their equations, they represent the distance between the center and a focus of each conic. \n\nStep 2: Find $a$ and $b$ using the relationship $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$ for the ellipse, and $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$ for the hyperbola.\n\nWe know from the ellipse's foci that $c = 4.$ For the ellipse we can use \\[c^2 = a^2 + b^2.\\] With the given foci at $(0,\\pm c),$ we have $c^2 = 16 = a^2 + b^2.$\n\nFrom the hyperbola's foci that we have $(\\pm c,0)$, $c=6$. we can use $c^2 = a^2 - b^2.$ Given $c^2 = 36$, we get \\[36 = a^2 - b^2.\\]\n\nNow we can solve the two equations for the $a^2$ and $b^2$ terms of the $c^2$ equations derived for the ellipse and the hyperbola.\n\nWe got that:\n\\[36 = a^2 - b^2,\\] \n\\[16 = a^2 + b^2.\\]\n\nFor $a^2 + b^2 = 36$  subtract the $a^2 + b^2 = 16$ we got $20 = 2b^2$. After we getting $b^2 = 10$. Given the $36 = a^2-b^2$ and $b^2=10,$, we can simplify to get $36 = a^2-10$. Therefore we get $a^2 = 46.$\n\nSo we now know $a^2$ is 46, and $b^2$ is 10. Using the $c^2$ formulas for both the ellipse and the hyperbola, we now have $c^2$ values that directly relate to both $a$ and $b.$ The calculated values are $c^2=16$, $a^2=46$ and $b^2=10$\n\nStep 3: Find the $a \\times b$ value and apply the absolute value to find $|ab|$.\n\nWe can find the $a \\times b$ value by taking the square root of $a^2 \\times b^2$. $a^2 * b^2$ is $46*10 = 460$. Finally, we can find the absolute value of $a \\times b$ by taking the square root of the $a^2 * b^2$ value.\n\nTherefore, $|ab| = \\sqrt{460}$\n\nWe got $|ab| = \\boxed{\\sqrt{460}}$."
