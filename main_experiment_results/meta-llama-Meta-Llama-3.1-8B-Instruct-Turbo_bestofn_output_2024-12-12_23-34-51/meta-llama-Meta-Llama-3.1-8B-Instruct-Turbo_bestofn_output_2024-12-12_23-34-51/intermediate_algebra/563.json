    "To find the number of real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation, let's first understand what the equation represents. The left-hand side of the equation is the absolute value (or modulus) of the complex number $\\frac12-ci$. \n\nThe absolute value of a complex number $z = x + yi$ is defined as $\\left|z\\right| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Here, $x = \\frac12$ and $y = -c$.\n\nSo, the equation becomes $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + (-c)^2} = \\frac34$. Squaring both sides of the equation, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + (-c)^2 &= \\left(\\frac34\\right)^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac14 + c^2 &= \\frac{9}{16}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad c^2 &= \\frac{9}{16} - \\frac14 = \\frac{9-4}{16} = \\frac{5}{16}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad c &= \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{16}} = \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt5}{4}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince we have two possible values of $c$ (positive and negative), we have $\\boxed{2}$ real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation.",
    "To solve the equation, let's first express the absolute value in terms of its definition. The absolute value of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is given by $|z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. \n\nIn this case, we have $z = \\frac{1}{2} - ci$. Therefore, $|z| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + (-c)^2}$.\n\nWe are given that $|z| = \\frac{3}{4}$. Equating these expressions, we get:\n\n$\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + (-c)^2} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, let's square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + (-c)^2 = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$\\frac{1}{4} + c^2 = \\frac{9}{16}$\n\nSubtracting $\\frac{1}{4}$ from both sides gives:\n\n$c^2 = \\frac{9}{16} - \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nWe need to find a common denominator to subtract the fractions.

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They follow the same steps to solve the equation and arrive at the same conclusion: there are two real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nHowever, Solution 1 is the most concise and well-written. It clearly explains the steps involved in solving the equation and provides a clear and concise final answer.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "We have $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\sqrt{{\\frac12}^2 + (-c)^2} = \\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14}$, so $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ gives us $\\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14} = \\frac34$.  Squaring both sides gives $c^2 + \\frac14 = \\frac9{16}$, so $c^2=\\frac5{16}$.  Taking the square root of both sides gives $c = \\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ and $c=-\\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ as solutions, so there are $\\boxed{2}$ real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nWe also could have solved this equation by noting that $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ means that the complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is $\\frac34$ units from the origin in the complex plane.  Therefore, it is on the circle centered at the origin with radius $\\frac34$.  The complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is also on the vertical line that intersects the real axis at $\\frac12$, which is inside the aforementioned circle.  Since this line goes inside the circle, it must intersect the circle at $\\boxed{2}$ points, which correspond to the values of $c$ that satisfy the original equation.",
