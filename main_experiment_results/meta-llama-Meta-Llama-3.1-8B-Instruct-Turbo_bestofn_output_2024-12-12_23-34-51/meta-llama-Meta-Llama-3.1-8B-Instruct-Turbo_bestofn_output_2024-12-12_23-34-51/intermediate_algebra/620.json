    "Step 1: Understand that a quadratic function can be represented in the form $y = a(x - p)(x - q)$, where $p$ and $q$ are the roots or zeroes of the function. \n\nGiven that the zeroes are at $x = 2$ and $x = 4$, we can write the function as $y = a(x - 2)(x - 4)$.\n\nStep 2: The function must pass through the point $(3, 6)$ when $x = 3$. To find the constant $a$, we substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ into the function.\n\n$6 = a(3 - 2)(3 - 4)$\nSimplifying this: \n$6 = a(1)(-1)$\n$6 = -a$\n\nStep 3: Multiply both sides of the equation by -1 to find the value of $a$.\n\n$a = -6$\n\nStep 4: Substitute the value of $a$ back into the quadratic function $y = a(x - 2)(x - 4)$\n\n$y = -6(x - 2)(x - 4)$\n\nStep 5: Expand the function into the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c$.\n\n$y = -6(x^2 - 6x + 8)$ \n$y = -6x^2 + 36x - 48$\n\nThus, the desired quadratic function in standard form is $-6x^2 + 36x - 48$.",
    "To create a quadratic function with zeroes at $x = 2$ and $x = 4$, we need to form a factored expression where the roots are the factors. \n\nThe factored expression is given by $f(x) = a(x - 2)(x - 4)$, where $a$ is a constant that we need to determine.\n\nSince we want $f(3) = 6$, we can substitute $x = 3$ into the equation and solve for $a$.\n\nWe get:\n\n$6 = a(3 - 2)(3 - 4)$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$6 = a \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1)$\n\nThis gives us $-6 = a$.

    "To find the quadratic function with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$, we can write the function in factored form as $a(x-2)(x-4)$.\n\nSince the function has zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$, substituting these values into the function will result in the function equalling $0$. So, we have:\n\n$a(2-2)(2-4) = a(0) = 0$\n\nand\n\n$a(4-2)(4-4) = a(2)(0) = 2a(0) = 0$\n\nWe still need to find the value of $a$.\n\nWhen $x=3$, the function equals $6$. Substituting $x=3$ into the function, we have:\n\n$a(3-2)(3-4) = a(1)(-1) = -a = 6$\n\nSimplifying this, we find that $-a=6$ which we can solve for $a$ and obtain:\n\n$a = -6$\n\nNow that we have found the value of $a$, we can write the quadratic function in factored form as:\n\n$-6(x-2)(x-4)$\n\nFinally, we can expand this expression to get the function in the form $ax^2+bx+c$:\n\n$-6(x^2-4x-2x+8)$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we have:\n\n$-6(x^2-6x+8)$\n\nHence,\n\n$-6(x^2-6x+8) = -6x^2+36x-48$\n\nSo, the quadratic function with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$, and that takes the value $6$ when $x=3$, is $\\boxed{-6x^2+36x-48}$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They all arrive at the same quadratic function: $-6x^2 + 36x - 48$. \n\nHowever, the best solution is Solution 1. It is the most concise and easiest to follow. It clearly explains each step and uses clear notation. \n\nIndex of the best solution: 1",
  "solution": "An example of a quadratic function with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ is $(x-2)(x-4)$. However, when $x=3$, this function takes the value $-1$. However, multiplying the entire quadratic by $-6$ does not change the location of the zeroes, and does give us the desired value at $x=3$.\n\nThus, $-6(x-2)(x-4)$ has all the desired properties. The expanded form of this expression is $\\boxed{-6x^2+36x-48}$.\n\nNote that this is the only such quadratic. Any quadratic must factor as $a(x-r)(x-s)$, where its zeroes are $r$ and $s$; thus a quadratic with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ must be of the form $a(x-2)(x-4)$, and the coefficient $a=-6$ is forced by the value at $x=3$.",
