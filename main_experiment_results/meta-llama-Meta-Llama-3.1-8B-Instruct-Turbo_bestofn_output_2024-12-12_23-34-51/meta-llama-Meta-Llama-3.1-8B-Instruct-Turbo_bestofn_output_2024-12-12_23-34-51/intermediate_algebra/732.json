    "To solve this problem, we need to find the volume of the box and set it less than 700 units.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the volume of the box, which is given by the formula: \nVolume = length * width * height.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\nVolume = (x+5)(x-5)(x^2+25).\n\nUsing the difference of squares formula (a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2, we can rewrite this as:\nVolume = (x^2 - 25)(x^2 + 25).\n\nExpanding the product, we get:\nVolume = x^4 - 625.\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which the volume is less than 700 units. So we set up the inequality:\nx^4 - 625 < 700.\n\nAdding 625 to both sides, we get:\nx^4 < 1325.\n\nNow we need to find the fourth root of both sides to isolate x:\nx < \u221c1325.\n\nEvaluating the fourth root, we get:\nx < 6.88.\n\nSince we are looking for positive integer values of x, we need to find the positive integer values less than 6.88. The possible values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nHowever, we need to check two things: \n\n1. The width of the box is given by (x-5), and x-5 must be positive for a real box.\n2. The volume must be a real number.\n\nGiven the above conditions, the value of x must be greater than 5.\n\nNow looking at our integer possibilities and this condition, we have to exclude the values 1,2,3,4 since they are less than 5. This leaves us with the possibilities 5,6.\n\nAlso, we need to check whether x=6 makes the volume less than 700 units. When x=6, the volume is 6^4 - 625 = 2145, which is greater than 700 units. So x=6 does not satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, x=5 is the only value that satisfies the conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

  "solution": "To find the volume of the box, we multiply the three dimensions: $(x+5)(x-5)(x^{2}+25) = (x^{2}-25)(x^{2}+25) = x^{4}-625$. We want to find $x$ such that $x^{4}-625<700$, which simplifies to $x^{4}<1325$. Taking the fourth root shows us that $x$ is less than $\\sqrt[4]{1325}$, which is between 6 and 7 (since $6^4=1296$ while $7^4=2401$). So $x$ could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, we see that the width is $x-5$ units, and this must be a positive number, so the only value of $x$ which works is 6. Thus, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ possible value of $x$.",
