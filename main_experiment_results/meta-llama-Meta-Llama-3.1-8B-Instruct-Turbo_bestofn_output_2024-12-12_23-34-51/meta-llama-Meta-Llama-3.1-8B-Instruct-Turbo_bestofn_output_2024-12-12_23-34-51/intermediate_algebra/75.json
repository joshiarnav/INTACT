    "To find the mid-point of the line segment in the complex plane, we can use the midpoint formula. The midpoint formula in the complex plane is similar to the midpoint formula in the Cartesian coordinate system. \n\nLet's denote the complex number corresponding to the mid-point of the line segment as $z$. We can write the two given end-points as $(z_1)$ and $(z_2)$, where $z_1 = -11 + 3i$ and $z_2 = 3 - 7i$.\n\nUsing the midpoint formula, we have:\n\n$z = \\frac{z_1 + z_2}{2}$\n\nTo find the value of $z$, we can substitute $z_1$ and $z_2$ into the formula:\n\n$z = \\frac{-11 + 3i + 3 - 7i}{2}$\n\nCombine like terms in the numerator:\n\n$z = \\frac{-8 - 4i}{2}$\n\nSimplify the expression by dividing both the real and imaginary parts by 2:\n\n$z = \\frac{-8}{2} - \\frac{4}{2}i$\n\n$z = -4 - 2i$\n\nThe complex number corresponding to the mid-point of the line segment is $\\boxed{-4 - 2i}$.",
    "To find the complex number corresponding to the mid-point of the line segment, we need to find the average of the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the end-points separately.\n\nThe x-coordinates of the end-points are -11 and 3. The average of -11 and 3 is:\n\n(-11 + 3) / 2 = -8/2 = -4\n\nThe y-coordinates of the end-points are 3i and -7i. The average of 3i and -7i is:\n\n(3i - 7i) / 2 = -4i / 2 = -2i\n\nTherefore, the complex number corresponding to the mid-point of the line segment is -4 - 2i.\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{-4 - 2i}$",
    "To find the mid-point of the line segment, we need to find the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates.\n\nFirst, let's find the x-coordinate of the mid-point: \nx-coordinate of mid-point = (-11 + 3)/2 = (-11 - 3)/2 * -1\nx-coordinate of mid-point = (-14)/2 * -1 = -7 * -1\nx-coordinate of mid-point = 7\n\nNext, let's find the y-coordinate of the mid-point:\ny-coordinate of mid-point = (3 - 7)/2 = (3 + 7)/2 * -1\ny-coordinate of mid-point = (10)/2 * -1 = 5 * -1\ny-coordinate of mid-point = -5\n\nNow that we have the x and y coordinates of the mid-point, we can write the complex number corresponding to it:\nMid-point = 7 - 5i\n\nTherefore, the answer is \n\\boxed{7 - 5i}."

  "critique": "Let's analyze each solution for correctness:\n\nSolution 1: This solution is correct. It uses the midpoint formula for complex numbers, which is a direct and straightforward approach. The calculations are also correct, and the final answer is -4 - 2i.\n\nSolution 2: This solution is also correct. It breaks down the problem into finding the average of the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates separately, which is a valid approach. The calculations are correct, and the final answer is -4 - 2i.\n\nSolution 3: This solution is incorrect. It incorrectly calculates the x and y coordinates of the mid-point. The x-coordinate should be (-11 + 3)/2 = -4, not 7. The y-coordinate should be (3 - 7)/2 = -2, not -5. Therefore, the correct complex number corresponding to the mid-point is -4 - 2i, not 7 - 5i.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best solutions are Solutions 1 and 2, which are both correct and well-presented. However, since the question asks for the index number of the best solution, I will select Solution 1 as the best solution (since it was the first correct solution presented).\n\nThe best solution is: 1",
