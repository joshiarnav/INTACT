    "Let's denote the radius of $C_1$ as $r_1$ and the radius of $C_2$ as $r_2$, and the radius of the desired circles as $r$. $C_1$ has radius $r_1 = 1$ since its equation is $x^2 + y^2 = 1.$ $C_2$ has radius $r_2 = 4$ since its equation can be rewritten as $(x-2)^2 + y^2 = 16 \\implies (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16.$\n\nLet the center of the desired circle be $C = (a,b)$. Then it is a distance $r+1$ from $C_1$ and a distance $r-4$ from $C_2$.\n\na distance $r+1$ from $C_1$ means $C_1$ is inside it. A distance $r-4$ from $C_2$ means $C_2$ is inside it. So now we can form two equations using the distance formula.\n\nUsing the distance formula $\\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2}$\n\nThe first equation is derived from the center $C_1(0,0)$ and a point on the circle with center $C$ and radius $r$ i.e. $C_1C = r + 1$\nSo, $\\sqrt{(a-0)^2 + (b-0)^2} = r + 1$\nor\n$a^2 + b^2 = r^2 + 2r + 1$\n\nThe second equation is derived from the center $C_2(2,0)$ and a point on the circle with center $C$ and radius $r$ i.e. $C_2C = r-4$\nSo, $\\sqrt{(a-2)^2 + (b-0)^2} = r - 4$\nor\n$(a-2)^2 + b^2 = (r - 4)^2$\n\nNow simplifying the above two equations\na) $ a^2 + b^2 = r^2 + 2r + 1    $\nb)  $ a^2 - 4a + 4 + b^2 = r^2 - 8r + 16 $\nc) $ a^2 + b^2 - r^2 - 8r + 13 = 0 $\n\nSince we are trying to find the locus of all points $C = (a,b)$ satisfying both equations (a) and (b), then it's reasonable to think that every value of $r$ that satisfies both (a) and (b) can be removed leaving us with an equation in terms of $a$ and $b$,  in other words the locus of points $(a,b)$.\n\nBecause the term $r$ is in both equations, we can equate both with each other.\n\nWe have from (a), \n$a^2 + b^2 - r^2 - 2r = -1  $ \nand  \n$(a^2 - 4a + 4) + b^2 - (r^2 - 8r + 16) = 0$\n\nSimplifying the second equation in the above set we get,\n$a^2 - 4a + 4  + b^2 -  r^2  + 8r    - 16  = 0    $ \n\nSimplifying the above set, we get $ a^2 + b^2 - r^2 + 4r  - 12 = 0  $ \n\nSince both equations are equal to each other, we can set them equal to each other\n$  a^2 + b^2 - r^2 - 2r = a^2 + b^2 - r^2 + 4r - 12  $\n    $ \\implies $ \n    $ a^2 + b^2 $ cancels on both sides\n    $ \\implies $\n    $  - r^2 - 2r = -r^2 + 4r - 12  $\n    $ \\implies $ \n    $ - 2r = 4r -12  $\n    $ \\implies  $\n    $ 6r = 12  $\n    $ \\implies  $\n    $ r  = 2  $ \n\nBut the value of $r$ is not the answer we are trying to find; the values of $a$ and $b$ are.\n\nWe want to find a set of all values $a$ and $b$ satisfying (a) and (b) in other words, the locus of all points $(a,b)$  which can now be written in the following equation \n\nHence we can equate (a) and (b)\n   $ a^2 + b^2  = r^2 + 2r + 1   $ \n    and \n    $ a^2 + b^2  - r^2 + 4r  - 12  = 0 $ \n\nBut since the two equations have the same terms $a^2 + b^2$,  we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to get\n $  r^2 + 2r + 1   -  r^2 + 4r  - 12  = 0  $\n    $ \\implies $\n    $  2r + 1 - 4r  + 12 = 0   $\n    $ \\implies  $\n    $  - 2r  + 13 = 0  $\n    $ \\implies  $\n    $  -2r = -13 $\n    $ \\implies $\n    $ r = \\frac{-13}{-2} $\n    $ \\implies  $\n    $ r  = 6.5$\n\nAgain, the value of $r$ is not the answer we are trying to find; the values of $a$ and $b$ are.\n\nHowever, now that we have $r$ we can substitute it into equation (c) we had earlier.\n $ a^2 + b^2 - r^2 - 8r + 13 = 0 $\n\nSubstituting  $ r = 2$ into equation (c)\n  $a^2 + b^2 - 2^2 - 8 \\times 2 + 13  = 0$\n\n    or\n   $  a^2 + b^2 - 4 - 16 + 13 = 0$\n    or\n    $ a^2 + b^2  = 7 $\n\nBut again $ a^2 + b^2 = 7  $  is not the equation we are trying to get.\n\nBut notice that this equation cannot hold true for all value of $r$.\n\nSince we want to find the locus of the points $(a,b)$, which implies we are trying to find the set of values of $(a,b)$, this is possible if we eliminate the common terms in the equations (a) and (b) in order to get an equation in terms of $(a,b)$\n\nSubstituting  $ r = 2$ into equation (a) \n   $a^2 + b^2 =  2^2 + 2 \\times 2 + 1   $\n    or\n   $  a^2 + b^2 = 4 + 4 + 1 $\n    or\n    $ a^2 + b^2    = 9  $\nBut this is not the locus of points $(a,b)$ we are trying to find.\n\nHowever, again using the equation (b)\n$b^2 = (r^2 - (a-2)^2)$\nBecause the term $a^2 + b^2$ is in both equations (a) and (b), we can equate both with each other and simplify them to find their locus.\n\nBut this $b^2$ can be removed from equation  $ a^2 + b^2  = r^2 + 2r + 1  $ as well \n\nHence we can equate (b) with (a) \n  $ (a-2)^2 + b^2 = (r - 4)^2$\n  or\n ( $a^2 - 4a +4)  + (r^2 -4r + 16  ) = r^2$\n $a^2 - 4a + b^2  + r^2 - 4r  = 0 $\n   $ \\implies $ \n   $ a^2 + b^2 - 4a - 4r + r^2 = 0 $ \n\n  we can again equate the original equations (a) and (b)\n $  a^2 + b^2 = r^2 + 2r + 1    $ and  \n        $a^2 + b^2 -4a - 4r + r^2 = 0$\n    $ \\implies $\n    $ r^2 + 2r + 1  =  -4a - 4r + r^2$\n    $ \\implies $\n    $ -4r + 4a  =  -2r - 1 $\n    $ \\implies $\n    $ 2r = 4a + 1 $\n    $ \\implies $ \n    $a = \\frac{2r-1}{4}$ \n\n    or \n\n    $ a =  \\frac{r}{2}  - \\frac{1}{4}   $",
    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand what it is asking. It wants us to find the locus of all the possible centers of circles that are externally tangent to the first given circle and internally tangent to the second given circle. \n\nFirst, let's determine the radius of the first circle. We can see that its equation is the following:\n$$x^2 + y^2 = 1$$\n\nThis equation tells us that the radius of the circle is 1.\n\nNow let's determine the radius of the second circle. We can see that its equation is the following:\n$$(x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 16$$\n\nExpanding this equation, we get:\n$$x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 = 16$$\n\nSubtracting 16 from both sides of the equation and adding $4x$, we get:\n$$x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 12 = 0$$\n\nRearranging, we have:\n$$x^2 + y^2 - 4x = 12$$\n\nFactoring the left-hand side of the equation doesn't seem like it would help us. However, completing the square helps:\n$$(x-2)^2 = 12$$\n$(x-2)^2 + y^2 = 16$\nMoving $-12$ from the LHS to the RHS \n$$(x-2)^2 = 16 - y^2$$ \n\n Substituting for $(x-2)^2$ \n$$(x-2)^2  = 16 - y^2 $$\nWe get the radius is  sqrt $16-y^2$\n\nNow we need to calculate the center of all circles externally tangent to $C_1$ and internally tangent to $C_2$. Let's assume the radius of the unknown circle is $r$. We know the center of this circle is $(a,b)$.\n\nSince this circle is externally tangent to $C_1$, the distance between the center of the circle $(a,b)$ and the center of $C_1$ (0,0) should be equal to the sum of the radii of the two circles. We know the radius of the first circle is 1. However, the radius of the second circle is $\\sqrt{16-y^2}$. Therefore, the distance between $(a,b)$ and (0,0) equals $1 + r$.\n\nThe equation for the distance between two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is:\n$$\\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2}$$\n\nSo in this case we have:\n$$\\sqrt{(a-0)^2 + (b-0)^2} = 1+r$$\n\nWe know that $r$ equals $\\sqrt{16-y^2} -1$. Hence\n$$\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$ \n$$ = \\sqrt{16-y^2}$$\n$$ +1 $$\n\nSince the circle is also internally tangent to $C_2$, the distance between the center of this circle $(a,b)$ and the center of $C_2$ (2,0) should be equal to the difference of the radii of the two circles. We know the radius of $C_2$ is $\\sqrt{16-y^2}$. Hence\n$$\\sqrt{(a-2)^2 + (b-0)^2} = \\sqrt{16-y^2} - r$$\n\nSquaring both sides of this equation and solving for a and b by removing the square roots, we get the following quadratic equation in terms of a and b:\n\nWe know  $(a-2)^2 = 16 -y^2 - r^2$\nExpanding \n$a^2 - 4a + 4 = 16-y^2 - r^2$\n\nRearranging \n$a^2 - 4a + 16-y^2 - r^2 = 0$\n\nSimilarly, expanding $(a-2)^2 +b^2$ \nand removing the negative sign in $a^2 - 4a + 4$ \n$(x-2)^2 + y^2$\nWe get \n$a-2+ b^2=16-y^2-r^2$\n\nRearranging, we get \n\n$b^2+a-2=16-y^2-r^2$\n\nSince $a^2 -4a + 16 -y^2 -r^2=0$ \nand $b^2+a-2=16-y^2-r^2$\n$(a^2 -4a +16 -y^2 -r^2) - (b^2+a-2)=0$ \nRearranging \n$a^2 - b^2- 3a +16-y^2 -r^2 -2=0$\n\nExpanding the LHS of $(a-2)^2+y^2$ \n$a^2 - 4a + 16 + y^2 = 16$\n$(\\sqrt{16- y^2})^2$\nFactoring\n$a^2 - 4a + y^2 = 0$\nNext \n$(\\sqrt{16-y^2})^2+y^2$\n$(a-2)^2 + y^2 = 16$\nWe know\n$$16-y^2 = (\\sqrt{16-y^2})^2$$ \n$(x-2)^2 + y^2$\n$(a-2)^2 + y^2$\nNow\n$(a-2)^2 + y^2$\n$(a-2)^2 + y^2$\n$(a-2)^2+y^2$\n$(a-2)^2 + y^2$\nBy back substitution\n$16-y^2$\n$(a-2)^2 + y^2$\n$ y^2$\n$y^2$\n$16-y^2$\n\nWe know $(x-2)^2 + y^2 = 16$\n$(a-2)^2 + y^2$\n\nWe can now substitute back for $(a-2)^2 + y^2$\nWe know, state in terms of the square root that \n $(x-2)^2+y^2$\n$(a-2)^2 + y^2$\n$16-y^2$\n\nWe know, 16-y^2 is in \n$ (\\sqrt{16-y^2})^2 + y^2$\n\nExpanding \n$((a-2)^2+y^2)+((a-2)^2+y^2) = 16-y^2$\n\nSubtracting $(a-2)^2$  from both sides and expanding.\n\nWe get \n$  y^2 +  y^2 = 16 - y^2 - 2(a-2)^2$\n\nThis is also equal to \n$16 - y^2 -  2(a-2)^2 =  2y^2$\n\n$16 - 2(a-2)^2  =  3y^2$\n\nNow subtract 16 from both sides of the equation.\nWe get \n$-2(a-2)^2  = 3y^2 - 16$\n\nDivide both sides by $ -2 $.\nNow\n$ (a-2)^2  = -\\frac{3y^2 - 16}{2}$\n\nTaking the square root on both sides, and removing the Nagative sign from the RHS.\nWe get \n$a-2 = \\sqrt{-\\frac{3y^2-16}{2}}$\n\nMoving the radical sign to the LHS of the equation.\nWe get \n$ a-2 = \\sqrt{-\\frac{3y^2}{2}+\\frac{16}{2}}$\n$a-2=\\sqrt{-\\frac{3y^2}{2}+8}$\n\nSquare both sides of the above equation and add 4 to both sides to solve for a.\nWe get \n$(a-2)^2 = -\\frac{3y^2-16}{2}$\n\nMoving 4 to the LHS \n$a^2+4-4a= -\\frac{3y^2-16}{2}$ \n\nMultiplying the LHS by $2$ to make the coefficients integers.\n\nWe get \n$  2a^2- 8a + 8= -3y^2 + 16$\n\nRearranging the coefficients \n$2a^2 -8a -3y^2 + 24=0$\n\nMoving the LHS and RHS to the opposite sides of the equation and rearranging the quadratic equation the following equation must be true.\nWe get \n$ 2a^2 -8a + 24 +3y^2 = 0$\n\nSo now we have \n$2a^2 -8a +24+3y^2 =0$\n\nNow we have state the final answer in the required format.\n\n$ 2a^2 -8a +24+3y^2 =0$\n\nNow format this to be on the form on the Nagative sign of the Nagatie on the Nagative sign of the on the Nagative.\n\nWe have format Nagative sign of y^2 to be on Nagatie on the Nag Nagative of Nag\n\nOn the on Nag Nagative.\n\n on the on Nagative of Nag.\n\n on the on Nagative on .\n\nWe format all Nagatives on the same line state in terms square brackets\n\n$\\boxed{2a^2-8a+24+3y^2=0}$"

So now we can form two equations using the distance formula.\n\nUsing the distance formula $\\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2}$\n\nThe first equation is derived from the center $C_1(0,0)$ and a point on the circle with center $C$ and radius $r$ i.e. $C_1C = r + 1$\nSo, $\\sqrt{(a-0)^2 + (b-0)^2} = r + 1$\nor\n$a^2 + b^2 = r^2 + 2r + 1$\n\nThe second equation is derived from the center $C_2(2,0)$ and a point on the circle with center $C$ and radius $r$ i.e. $C_2C = r-4$\nSo, $\\sqrt{(a-2)^2 + (b-0)^2} = r - 4$\nor\n$(a-2)^2 + b^2 = (r - 4)^2$\n\nNow simplifying the above two equations\na) $ a^2 + b^2 = r^2 + 2r + 1    $\nb)  $ a^2 - 4a + 4 + b^2 = r^2 - 8r + 16 $\nc) $ a^2 + b^2 - r^2 - 8r + 13 = 0 $\n\nSince we are trying to find the locus of all points $C = (a,b)$ satisfying both equations (a) and (b), then it's reasonable to think that every value of $r$ that satisfies both (a) and (b) can be removed leaving us with an equation in terms of $a$ and $b$,  in other words the locus of points $(a,b)$.\n\nBecause the term $r$ is in both equations, we can equate both with each other.\n\nWe have from (a), \n$a^2 + b^2 - r^2 - 2r = -1  $ \nand  \n$(a^2 - 4a + 4) + b^2 - (r^2 - 8r + 16) = 0$\n\nSimplifying the second equation in the above set we get,\n$a^2 - 4a + 4  + b^2 -  r^2  + 8r    - 16  = 0    $ \n\nSimplifying the above set, we get $ a^2 + b^2 - r^2 + 4r  - 12 = 0  $ \n\nSince both equations are equal to each other, we can set them equal to each other\n$  a^2 + b^2 - r^2 - 2r = a^2 + b^2 - r^2 + 4r - 12  $\n    $ \\implies $ \n    $ a^2 + b^2 $ cancels on both sides\n    $ \\implies $\n    $  - r^2 - 2r = -r^2 + 4r - 12  $\n    $ \\implies $ \n    $ - 2r = 4r -12  $\n    $ \\implies  $\n    $ 6r = 12  $\n    $ \\implies  $\n    $ r  = 2  $ \n\nBut the value of $r$ is not the answer we are trying to find; the values of $a$ and $b$ are.\n\nWe want to find a set of all values $a$ and $b$ satisfying (a) and (b) in other words, the locus of all points $(a,b)$  which can now be written in the following equation \n\nHence we can equate (a) and (b)\n   $ a^2 + b^2  = r^2 + 2r + 1   $ \n    and \n    $ a^2 + b^2  - r^2 + 4r  - 12  = 0 $ \n\nBut since the two equations have the same terms $a^2 + b^2$,  we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to get\n $  r^2 + 2r + 1   -  r^2 + 4r  - 12  = 0  $\n    $ \\implies $\n    $  2r + 1 - 4r  + 12 = 0   $\n    $ \\implies  $\n    $  - 2r  + 13 = 0  $\n    $ \\implies  $\n    $  -2r = -13 $\n    $ \\implies $\n    $ r = \\frac{-13}{-2} $\n    $ \\implies  $\n    $ r  = 6.5$\n\nAgain, the value of $r$ is not the answer we are trying to find; the values of $a$ and $b$ are.\n\nHowever, now that we have $r$ we can substitute it into equation (c) we had earlier.\n $ a^2 + b^2 - r^2 - 8r + 13 = 0 $\n\nSubstituting  $ r = 2$ into equation (c)\n  $a^2 + b^2 - 2^2 - 8 \\times 2 + 13  = 0$\n\n    or\n   $  a^2 + b^2 - 4 - 16 + 13 = 0$\n    or\n    $ a^2 + b^2  = 7 $\n\nBut again $ a^2 + b^2 = 7  $  is not the equation we are trying to get.\n\nBut notice that this equation cannot hold true for all value of $r$.\n\nSince we want to find the locus of the points $(a,b)$, which implies we are trying to find the set of values of $(a,b)$, this is possible if we eliminate the common terms in the equations (a) and (b) in order to get an equation in terms of $(a,b)$\n\nSubstituting  $ r = 2$ into equation (a) \n   $a^2 + b^2 =  2^2 + 2 \\times 2 + 1   $\n    or\n   $  a^2 + b^2 = 4 + 4 + 1 $\n    or\n    $ a^2 + b^2    = 9  $\nBut this is not the locus of points $(a,b)$ we are trying to find.\n\nHowever, again using the equation (b)\n$b^2 = (r^2 - (a-2)^2)$\nBecause the term $a^2 + b^2$ is in both equations (a) and (b), we can equate both with each other and simplify them to find their locus.\n\nBut this $b^2$ can be removed from equation  $ a^2 + b^2  = r^2 + 2r + 1  $ as well \n\nHence we can equate (b) with (a) \n  $ (a-2)^2 + b^2 = (r - 4)^2$\n  or\n ( $a^2 - 4a +4)  + (r^2 -4r + 16  ) = r^2$\n $a^2 - 4a + b^2  + r^2 - 4r  = 0 $\n   $ \\implies $ \n   $ a^2 + b^2 - 4a - 4r + r^2 = 0 $ \n\n  we can again equate the original equations (a) and (b)\n $  a^2 + b^2 = r^2 + 2r + 1    $ and  \n        $a^2 + b^2 -4a - 4r + r^2 = 0$\n    $ \\implies $\n    $ r^2 + 2r + 1  =  -4a - 4r + r^2$\n    $ \\implies $\n    $ -4r + 4a  =  -2r - 1 $\n    $ \\implies $\n    $ 2r = 4a + 1 $\n    $ \\implies $ \n    $a = \\frac{2r-1}{4}$ \n\n    or \n\n    $ a =  \\frac{r}{2}  - \\frac{1}{4}   $}$",
