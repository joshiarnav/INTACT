    "To find the largest possible area of triangle $ABC$, we need to determine the maximum value of the area of the triangle given the constraints. \n\nStep 1: Find the height of the triangle\nThe height of the triangle can be calculated by finding the $y$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola, which is given by $\\frac{6}{2} = 3$. This is because the parabola is symmetric and the vertex is the highest point.\n\nStep 2: Find the base of the triangle\nSince the base of the triangle is the distance between points $A$ and $B$, we can find it by finding the difference in the $x$-coordinates: $4 - 1 = 3$.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the area of the triangle\nNow, we can calculate the area of the triangle using the formula $\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height.\n\nWe can see that the area is maximized when the height is maximized. However, since the height is fixed at $3$ and the base is fixed at $3$, the area is actually maximized when the points along the parabola are $(p, q)$ and $B = (4, 3)$, since the $y$ value of $A$ is $(1, 0)$.",
