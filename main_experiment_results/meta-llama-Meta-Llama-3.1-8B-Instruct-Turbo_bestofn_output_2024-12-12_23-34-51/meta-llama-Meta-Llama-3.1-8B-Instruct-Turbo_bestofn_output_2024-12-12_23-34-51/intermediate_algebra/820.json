    "To find the roots of the given polynomial, we can start by factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF) if it exists.\n\nThe given polynomial is $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$. \n\nFirst, we can factor out $x$ from every term. \n\nSo, $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x = x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20)$.\n\nHowever, we still have a fourth-degree polynomial, and it's not easy to factor this polynomial directly. \n\nOne way to simplify the problem is to use rational root theorem to find a possible rational root. \n\nHowever, in this specific case, let's try another method - group the terms as follows:\n\n$6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x = 6x^4-51x^2+19x^3+20x$.\n\nNow, notice that we have a common factor in each pair of terms except the middle one though middle terms should usually either be included or used as is.  \n\nGrouping these as $(6x^4 - 51x^2) + (19x^3 +20x)$, let's factor each pair. \n\nThe first pair, $6x^4 - 51x^2$, can be factored as:\n\n$6x^2(x^2-51/6x^0)$ \nThen further as: $\n6x^2(x^2-51/6)$ \nAs $6x^0 = 6$.\n\nFactoring out $x^0$ isn't needed as it is already $six$ and $51/6$ which simplifies to $8.5$.  \nFurther the above can be factored as: \n\n$6x^2(x-\u221a(51/6))$ or $6x^2 (x - \u221a8.5)$.",
    "To find the roots of the given polynomial $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$, we need to factorize it first.\n\nThe polynomial has an $x$ term, so we can start by factoring out an $x$:\n\n$6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x = x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20)$.\n\nNow, we need to factorize the cubic expression $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$.\n\nLet's use the rational root theorem to check for possible rational roots.\n\nThe possible rational roots are $\\pm\\frac{1}{1}, \\pm\\frac{2}{1}, \\pm\\frac{4}{1}, \\pm\\frac{5}{1}, \\pm\\frac{10}{1}, \\pm\\frac{20}{1}$. \n\nWe can start by checking if these possible roots are indeed roots of the polynomial.\n\nSince $20 = 5\\cdot4$ and $20$ is a root, we can use synthetic division or polynomial long division to factorize the expression.\n\nAfter dividing $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$ by $(x-20)$, we get:\n\n$6x^3+19x^2-51x+20 = (x-20)(6x^2+29x+1)$.\n\nNow, we have factored the given polynomial as:\n\n$6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x = x(x-20)(6x^2+29x+1)$.\n\nThe quadratic expression $6x^2+29x+1$ does not factor easily, so we can use the quadratic formula to find its roots.\n\nThe quadratic formula is given by $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. In this case, $a=6$, $b=29$, and $c=1$.\n\nPlugging in these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{-29\\pm\\sqrt{29^2-4\\cdot6\\cdot1}}{2\\cdot6}$\n\n$x = \\frac{-29\\pm\\sqrt{841-24}}{12}$\n\n$x = \\frac{-29\\pm\\sqrt{817}}{12}$\n\n$x = \\frac{-29\\pm\\sqrt{817}}{12}$\n\nThe approximate values of the roots of the quadratic expression are $\\frac{-29\\pm 28.7}{12}$.\n\nNow, let's combine the roots of the quadratic expression with the other factors to get the final list of roots.\n\nThe roots of the given polynomial are $\\frac{-29+28.7}{12}, \\frac{-29-28.7}{12}, 0, 20$.\n\nThe approximate values of the roots are $-0.083, -4.6, 0, 20$.\n\nThe exact roots are $\\frac{-29+28.7}{12}, \\frac{-29-28.7}{12}, 0, 20$.\n\nTherefore, the exact roots of the polynomial are $\\boxed{\\frac{-29+28.7}{12}, \\frac{-29-28.7}{12}, 0, 20}$.",
    "To find the roots of the given polynomial, we first notice that it is missing a constant term. This suggests that we can factor out a term from the polynomial to make it easier to find the roots.\n\nThe given polynomial is $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$. \n\nSince the polynomial is missing a constant term, let's rewrite it as $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x + 0$. \n\nWe can factor out the greatest common factor (GCF), which is $x$, to rewrite the polynomial as $x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20)$.\n\nNext, we can try to factor the cubic expression $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$ further by finding its roots using the Rational Root Theorem. \n\nUsing the Rational Root Theorem, we can divide the cubic polynomial into two binomials to reduce the problem's complexity.\n\nSince the polynomial has a degree of $4$ and two of its coefficients ($19$ and $20$ but primarily $-28$ and $18$ the two numbers that have common factors which divide to coefficients $19$ & $20$ and $-51$ & $6$) are divisible by two of the numbers that have common factors, which divide coefficients $19$ and $20$, we can make use of this to deduce that we can factor the polynomial as follows:\n\nFirst, by grouping the first two terms and the last two terms we have:\n$\\begin{align*}6x^3+19x^2-51x+20&=(6x^3+19x^2)+( -51x +20) \\end{align*}$\nThen, we factor out a common factor from each group: $(x^2+3x\\cdot2)+(x\\cdot(-51)+20)$\ngiving us\n$\\begin{align*}6x^3+19x^2-51x+20&=x^2\\cdot(3x+2)+(-x)(51+20)\\end{align*} $\nUsing the distributive property we get $(3x)(x^2)+2(x^2)+(-x)(71)$\nUsing the distributive property again we have $3\\cdot x\\cdot x^2 +2x^2 +(-51x-20x)$\nThen, we factor the trinomial $3x^2+2x^2+(-51x-20x)$ \nCombining like terms we have $x^2(x\\cdot3+x\\cdot2)+(x\\cdot(-51)+x\\cdot(-20))$\nCombining like terms we have $x^2(3x+2)+(-x)(71)$\nNow we can factor out the GCF of $x^2(3x+2)+(-x)(71)$ to get \n$\\begin{align*} x(x(3x+2))(-x(71)),\\end{align*}$ \n which is\n $x(x(3x+2)-x(71)).$ \nUsing the distributive property we have \n$\\begin{align*}x[x(3x+2)-x(71)]=x[(3x^2+2x)-(71x)].\\end{align*}$ \nUsing the distributive property again we have\n $\\begin{align*}x[(3x^2+2x)-(71x)]=x[3x^2+2x-71x].\\end{align*}$ \nUsing the distributive property we have \n$x[3x^2+2x-71x]=x[18x-60x]$ \nwhich is\n$\\begin{align*}x[18x-60x]=(-42)x(x-3)\\end{align*}$ \nwhich is\n$\\begin{align*}(-42)x(x-3)=x(-42)(x-3)\\end{align*}$\nSo, the expression is $x(x-3)(6x^2+42)$ that we have to factor into its simplest form by finding the GCF of the polynomial which is $6$. \nSo, the expression is $x(x-3)(6)(x^2+7)$ that we have to factor into its simplest form by finding the GCF of the polynomial which is $1$ since there is no factor that is common to all the terms of the polynomial. \nTherefore, we have $x(x-3)(6)(x^2+7)$, but unfortunately, the quadratic expression \n $x^2+7$ cannot be factored into the product of two binomials. Since we have that the quadratic expression $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$ has a factor of $x$, we know that the quadratic expression $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$ has the root $x=0$. \nAlso, we know that the factor $x$ is equal to zero when $x$ equals $0$. We know this because we know that we have to multiply the factors to find the polynomial, and that the term $x^4$ will equal $0$ when $x$ equals $0$.  \nWe also know that if we define $R$ as the quadratic expression $x^2+7$ that we have, then $R$ has no real roots. This is because we have that the graph of $R$ is a parabola that never intersects the $x$-axis. To see this, note that the function $f$ defined by $f(x)=x^2+7$ is the composition of the functions $g$ defined by $g(x)=x^2$ and $h$ defined by the function $h(x)=x^2+1$ followed by the function $k$ defined by the function $k(x)=x+6$. Since we know that the quadratic expression $x^2+1$ has no real roots, we have that the function $h(x)$ has no real roots. Since the composition $f(x)=h(g(x))$ is equal to $h(x)$, we have that the quadratic expression $x^2+7$ has no real roots. \nTherefore, we have to factor the quadratic expression $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$ as $x(x-3)(6)(x^2+7)$ where $x^2+7$ cannot be factored further. \nTherefore, the given polynomial $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$ has the two roots $0$ and $3$."

  "solution": "Since the polynomial has no constant term, we can immediately factor out an $x$ from every term\n$$x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20),$$and our first root $x=0$. Let $g(x) = 6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$. Then the remaining roots of our original polynomial are the roots of $g(x)$. By trying out simple values, we can see that $g(0) = 20 > 0$ and $g(1) = 6+19-51+20 = -6<0$. Thus, there must be a root of $g(x)$ between $0$ and $1$. From the Rational Root Theorem, we know that if $g(p/q) = 0$ then $p$ must divide $20$ and $q$ must divide $6$.\n\nChecking rational numbers of the form $p/q$, where $p$ divides $20$ and $q$ divides $6$, and $p/q$ is between $0$ and $1$, we find that\n$$\\begin{aligned} g\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) &= 6\\cdot\\frac{1}{8}+19\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}-51\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}+20 = 0.\n\\end{aligned}$$This means that $2x - 1$ is a factor of $g(x).$ Dividing by $2x-1$ gives us $g(x) = (2x-1)(3x^2+11x-20)$.\n\nThe quadratic $3x^2+11x-20$ factors as $(3x-4)(x+5),$ so our last two roots are $4/3$ and $-5$.\n\nThus, the roots of $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$ are $\\boxed{0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{4}{3}, -5}$.",
