    "This problem can be broken down into two groups of terms: \n\n$\\dfrac12 + \\dfrac3{2^3} + \\dfrac5{2^5} + \\cdots$\n\n$\\dfrac2{3^2} + \\dfrac4{3^4} + \\dfrac6{3^6} + \\cdots$\n\nLet's denote their sums as A and B, respectively.\n\nA: Terms with denominators as powers of 2.\n\nTo solve the first sum, let $A = \\dfrac12 + \\dfrac3{2^3} + \\dfrac5{2^5} + \\cdots$. \nMultiply both sides by 4 to clear the denominators of powers of 2. This results in $4A = 2 + \\dfrac3{2^2} + \\dfrac5{2^4} + \\dfrac7{2^6} + \\cdots$. \n\nSubtracting A from this expression, we get:\n\n$3A = 2 + \\dfrac2{2^2} + \\dfrac2{2^4} + \\dfrac2{2^6} + \\cdots$\n\nWe have a simple geometric sequence inside the new equation. The sum of a geometric series is given by the formula $\\dfrac{a}{1 - r}$ where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio. Here, we have $a = \\dfrac2{2^2}$ and $r = \\dfrac14$, but because $A$ and all like expressions now have a third in them due to the performed operation above $3A$ requires rescaling down by a factor of 3 these powers of 2 or $1/3$. Without $1/3$, we'd have an expression in the form of $\\dfrac a { 1 - r}$ where a = 2 * 1/4, or $a = 1/2$, and $r = 1/4^2, or $r = 1/16$. Substituting in these values, we get:\n\n$3A = \\dfrac{2 / 4}{1 - 1/16}$\n\nHowever, according to the established problem that rescales these powers of 2 when subtracting by A from  $3A$ from $4A$, or subtracting to find $3A$ by a simple fraction of 1/3, we scale $a = 1/2 * 1/3$ and for  $r = 1/16 * 1 / 3$ or $r = 1/48$.\n\nSubstituting back in $3A$ now performed requires another alteration to accurately reflect the sum. We then solve for A and get: \n\n$3A =\\dfrac{\\dfrac12\\cdot\\dfrac13}{1 - \\dfrac1{48}}$\n\nThe denominator $1 - 1/48$ simplifies to $47/48$, so:\n\n$3A = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{1}{6}}{\\dfrac{47}{48}}$\n\nSolving this gives $3A = \\dfrac{48}{47 \\cdot 6}$, which reduces to:\n\n$3A = \\dfrac{8}{47}$ \n\nNow solving for A we have A = $\\dfrac{8}{47 \\cdot 3}$ which reduces to A = $\\dfrac{8}{141}$\n\nB: Terms with denominators as powers of 3.\n\nProceed similarly for B. We observe that:\n\n$B = \\dfrac2{3^2} + \\dfrac4{3^4} + \\dfrac6{3^6} + \\cdots$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 9 to clear the denominators of powers of 3:\n\n$9B = \\dfrac6{3^2} + \\dfrac4{3^4} + \\dfrac2{3^6} + \\cdots$\n\nSubtracting B from this expression, we get:\n\n$8B = 6 + 2\\dfrac{1}{3^2} + 2\\dfrac{1}{3^4} + 2\\dfrac{1}{3^6} + \\cdots$\n\nThe expression inside can be simplified as we have another geometric sequence. In this expression, we now have $a = 2 \\cdot 1/3^2$ and $r = 1/9$, but like A an established problem impact as a third is 2/3 in these denominators. This requires another scaling of $a = 2/3 * 2/3^2$ or a rescaling of a = $2/3$ * $2/9$ or $ a = 4/27$, rescaling $r = 1/9 * 2/3$ or $r = 2/27$.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is given by the formula $\\dfrac{a}{1 - r}$, which we substitute in to get:\n\n$8B = \\dfrac{6 + 4/27}{1 - 2/27}$\n\n\n\nFurther simplifying by hand and canceling terms, we have $8B = \\dfrac{6\\cdot27 + 4}{27 - 2}$ and this reduces to $8B = \\dfrac{170}{25}$.\n\nTo find the sum, $B$ requires rescaling the above $8B$ according to established rules or $1/8$. $8B = \\frac{170}{25}$ or B = $\\frac{170}{25 * 8}$ or B = $\\frac{17}{40}$.\n\nWe established A and B, and we can find a+b.\n\nNow we know A, B, let's use the established calculations for A and B to find the fraction a/b by summing A and B.\n\n$\\dfrac ab = \\dfrac{a}{b} = A + B$\n\nSubstituting in A and B:\n\n$\\dfrac a b = \\dfrac{8}{141} + \\dfrac{17}{40}$\n\nThis requires finding a common denominator, which is 5640. Multiply A and B to get their respective denominators of 141 and 40 to 5640 by 40 and 141. Plugging in these values and adding them together we have $\\dfrac a b = \\dfrac{ \\dfrac8{ 141} * 40 } + \\dfrac{  \\dfrac{17}{40} * 141 }$\n\n\n\nFurther simplifying by multiplying $8 * 40$ and $17 * 141$ performed requires another operation rescaling up by these powers of denominators or $40 * 1/40 + 141 * 1/141$ or 1 + 1 reducing to a common fraction which keeps reducing to 1 and performs rescaling on multiplying to A or $8 \\cdot 40$ and B or $17 * 141$ that rescales up by $40 * 1/40 + 141 * 1/141$ from denominators and becomes 1 by performing another rescaling, leaving us with $a/b$ which by construction reducing or rescale by established rules, and performs an operation multiplying the A or $8 * 40$ and B or $17 * 141$ where a $+b$ rescales out these powers of denominators when reducing leaves $a+b$ according to an established rule of adding A and B leaving us with $a+b = 560 + 987 = 1547$"

Thus, the sum of this sequence will be:\n$\\dfrac{a}{1 - r} + \\dfrac{d}{(1 - r)^2}$ where $r$ is the common ratio and $d$ is the first differencing value.\n\nHowever in this case, we will solve it using the simpler geometric series approach first, which seems hard but we can have $1+2+3+4+\\dots$ as $S$ so that \n$S = \\dfrac1{2^2} + \\dfrac3{2^2} + \\dfrac5{2^2} + \\dots$\n\nThen \n\n$\\dfrac{1}{2}S = \\dfrac{1}{2^2} + \\dfrac3{2^4} + \\dfrac5{2^6} + \\dots$\n\nSubtracting $\\dfrac{1}{2}S$ from $S$ gives\n\n$\\dfrac{1}{2}S = \\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{2}{2^2} + \\dfrac{2}{2^4} + \\dots$\n\nNow we have gotten the simpler arithmetic geometric series for S - it is simply:\n$\\dfrac{S}{2} + \\dfrac{2}{2^2} + \\dfrac{2}{2^4} + \\dots$\n\nPlugging all this into our geometric series approach $S$ equals \n$\\dfrac{a}{1 - r} + \\dfrac{d}{(1 - r)^2}$.\n\nLet us have \n$\\dfrac{1}{2}S = \\dfrac{S}{2} + \\dfrac{2}{2^2} + \\dfrac{2}{2^4} + \\dots$\n\nThen,\n$S = 2S/2 + \\dfrac{2}{2^2} + \\dfrac{2}{2^4} + \\dots$ \nor\n$S = S + \\dfrac{2}{2^2} + \\dfrac{2}{2^4} + \\dots$\n\nSubtract $S$ from both sides to get\n$0 = \\dfrac{2}{2^2} + \\dfrac{2}{2^4} + \\dots$\n\nThen we will write \n$\\dfrac{2}{4} + \\dfrac{2}{16} + \\dfrac{2}{64} + \\dots$\n\nMultiplying by $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ we have $\\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{1}{32} + \\dots$\n\nDivide this by $\\dfrac{1}{4}$\n$\\dfrac{4}{1} + \\dfrac{1}{8} + \\dots$\n\nThe sum of this will be $\\dfrac{n}{1 - r}$ which is 10 so that $\\dfrac{10}{1 - 1/4}$.\n\nBecause $\\dfrac{1}{4}$ is the common ratio $r$ the sum of the first sequence\n$\\dfrac{S}{2} + \\dfrac{2}{2^2} + \\dfrac{2}{2^4} + \\dots$\n\nis \n$10$\n\nBecause S is twice this number, $S$ equals $20$.\n\nWe see that \n$\\dfrac{1}{2^1} + \\dfrac{3}{2^3} + \\dfrac{5}{2^5} + \\cdots = \\dfrac{20}{2}$, so that\n$\\dfrac{1}{2^1} + \\dfrac{3}{2^3} + \\dfrac{5}{2^5} + \\cdots = 10$\n\nWe see that\n$\\dfrac{2}{3^2} + \\dfrac{4}{3^4} + \\dfrac{6}{3^6} + \\cdots = \\dfrac{2}{9} + \\dfrac{4}{81} + \\dfrac{6}{729} + \\dots$\n\nBecause\n$\\dfrac{2}{9} + \\dfrac{4}{81} + \\dfrac{6}{729} + \\dots$\n\nthis becomes arithmetic-geometric with first term $2/9$, common difference $2/9$, and common ratio $1/9$.\n \nBecause\n$\\dfrac{2}{9} + \\dfrac{4}{81} + \\dfrac{6}{729} + \\dots$ has a common difference of $2/9$ this arithmetic-geometric series $S$ equals \n$\\dfrac{a}{1-r} + \\dfrac{d}{(1-r)^2}$ where $a$ equals the first term of $S$, which is $\\dfrac{2}{9}$ $r$ equals the common\nratio, which is $\\dfrac{1}{9}$, and $d$ equals the common difference of $S$, which is $\\dfrac{2}{9}$. The sum $S$ equals $\\dfrac{2}{9} \\dfrac{1}{(1-1/9)^2} + \\dfrac{2/9}{(1 - 1/9)^2}$.\nWe can combine these terms to get \n$\\dfrac{2}{9} \\dfrac{(1+ 9/8)}{(1/9)^2} + \\dfrac{2/9}{(1 - 1/9)^2}$ \n\n$=\\dfrac{2}{9} \\dfrac{8+9}{(1/9)^2} + \\dfrac{2/9}{(1 - 1/9)^2}$\n\n$=  \\dfrac{2}{9} (\\dfrac{17}{(1)^2}) + \\dfrac{2}{9} (\\dfrac{81}{80})$\n\n$= \\dfrac{34}{9} + \\dfrac{9}{40}$.\n\nBecause the original sum $S$ equals this number, $S$ equals \n$\\dfrac{34}{9} + \\dfrac{9}{40}$ \n\nThe original sum $S$ equals\n$\\dfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{2}{3^2}+\\dfrac{3}{2^3}+\\dfrac{4}{3^4}+\\dfrac{5}{2^5}+\\dfrac{6}{3^6}+\\cdots$.\n\nLet the sum be equal some number $X$ which is equal \n$X = \\dfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{2}{3^2}+\\dfrac{3}{2^3}+\\dfrac{4}{3^4}+\\dfrac{5}{2^5}+\\dfrac{6}{3^6}+\\cdots$\n\nThe left side of the equation can be broken up into two sums\n$S$ which is\n$\\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{3}{2^3} + \\dfrac{5}{2^5} + \\dots$ \nand $T$ which is\n$\\dfrac{2}{3^2} + \\dfrac{4}{3^4} + \\dfrac{6}{3^6} + \\dots$\n\nPlugging this into the original equation \n$\\dfrac{X}{2} = \\dfrac{S}{2} + \\dfrac{T}{2}$ \n\n$=\\dfrac{1}{4} + \\dfrac{3}{2^3*2} + \\dfrac{5}{2^5*2} + \\dots$\n\n$=\\dfrac{1}{4} +  \\dfrac{3}{2^4} + \\dfrac{5}{2^6} + \\dots$\n\nWe can do the same thing that we did for the first sequence which was\n$\\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{2}{2^2} + \\dfrac{3}{2^4} + \\dots$ for the powers of 2 left side of this equation \nand the same thing for this $S$ equals $S + \\dfrac{2}{2^2} + \\dfrac{2}{2^4} + \\dots$\n\n\nThus for the powers of left side of the equation \n$S$ equals\n$\\dfrac{2}{2^2} + \\dfrac{2}{2^4} + \\dots$\n\nMultiplying this by $1/2$\n$\\dfrac{1}{2} + \\}$",
