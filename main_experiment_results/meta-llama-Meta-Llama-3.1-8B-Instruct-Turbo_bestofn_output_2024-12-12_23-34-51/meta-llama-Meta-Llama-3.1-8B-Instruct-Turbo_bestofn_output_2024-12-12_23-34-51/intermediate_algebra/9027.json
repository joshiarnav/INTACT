    "To find the greatest possible value of $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$, we can consider the system of equations given. Let's denote $f(x) = x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$. \n\nNow if we consider $f(x) = (x^2 + ax + c)(x^2 + bx + d)$ and expand it, we get\n\n$f(x) = x^4 + (a+b)x^3 + (ab+c+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + cd.$\n\nComparing the coefficients with the given system of equations, we can say that the coefficients of the polynomial $f(x)$ correspond to the equations in the given system. \n\nWe can express the polynomial as\n\n$f(x) = x^4 + 15x^3 + 78x^2 + 160x + 96.$\n\nBy factorizing the polynomial $f(x)$, we can find its roots. We can try to factorize it by finding its greatest common factor (GCF) if any, but in this case, the polynomial does not have any common factors other than 1.\n\nBy trial and error, we can factorize it as\n\n$x^4 + 15x^3 + 78x^2 + 160x + 96 = (x+12)(x+8)(x+3)(x+2)$. \n\nTo calculate the greatest possible value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$, we need to find all the possible combinations of $(a,b,c,d)$.\n\nWe can factorize the polynomial into four different ways by assigning the factors to $(x^2 + ax + c), (x^2 + bx + d)$ and their corresponding permutations:\n\n1. $(x+12)(x+8) = (x+20)(x),$\n   $(x+12)(x+2) = (x+14)(x),$\n   $(x+8)(x+3) = (x+11)(x),$\n   $(x+8)(x+2) = (x+10)(x),$\n   $(x+12)(x+3) = (x+15)(x),$\n   $(x+12)(x+2) = (x+14)(x)$.\n\nSo, the following combinations are possible:\n\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(20,0,8,0)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(0,20,8,0)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(8,0,20,0)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(0,8,20,0)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(11,0,3,8)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(0,11,3,8)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(8,0,11,3)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(0,8,11,3)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(10,0,2,8)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(0,10,2,8)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(8,0,10,2)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(0,8,10,2)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(15,0,3,2)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(0,15,3,2)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(3,0,15,2)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(2,0,15,3)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(14,0,2,3)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(0,14,2,3)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(2,0,14,3)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(3,0,14,2)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(14,0,3,2)$\n$(a,b,c,d)$ = $(2,0,14,3)$\n\nSo, now if we want to find the greatest possible value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$, we can calculate the value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ for each of the combinations above and choose the maximum.\n\nWe can observe that for all the combinations above, the maximum value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ occurs at $(a,b,c,d) = (20,0,8,0), (0,20,8,0), (8,0,20,0)$ or $(0,8,20,0)$. The value of $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)$ is $400 + 64 = 464$ in each of these cases.\n\nHence, the greatest possible value of $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$ is $\\boxed{464}$.",

As a result, a + d should equal -4, b + c should equal -24 so the polynomials factor to the required values.\n\nLet's consider two different cases:\n1. When a and d are equal to -2, we can solve for b and c by examining the systems equations.\n   a + b = 15\n   a = 15 - b\n   Since a and d are -2 we have the equation\n   15 - b + d = -4\n   b + (15-b) - 4 = -4\n   15 - 4 = 15 - 4\n   11 = 11\n   Similarly \n   ab + c + d = 78\n   -2b + c + (-2) = 78\n   -2b + c = 80\n   \n   (b + c)^2 = b^2 + 2bc + c^2\n   Similarly,\n   (a + d)^2 = ( -2 + -2)^2 = (-4)^2\n   16 = 16\n   We can now substitute (b + c) with -24 in the previous equation.\n   (-24)^2 = b^2 + 2bc + c^2\n   576 = b^2 + 2bc + c^2\n   \n   We can now look at the system of three equations for this case:\n   1. 15 - b = -2\n   2. -2b + c = 80\n   3. 576 = b^2 + 2bc + c^2\n   \n   We can simplify equation 1.\n   15 - b = -2\n   -b = -17\n   b = 17\n   \n   Substituting b in equation 2.\n   -2 * (17) + c = 80\n   -34 + c = 80\n   c = 114\n   \n   Substituting b and c in equation 3.\n   576 = (17)^2 + 2 * 17 * 114 + (114)^2\n   576 = 289 + 3828 + 12996\n   576 = 17213\n   \n   This is a contradiction, so we will not consider this case.\n \n2. When a and d are equal to -6, we can solve for b and c by examining the systems equations.\n   We already know a + b = 15 and ad + bc = 160\n   Similarly \n   -6 + b = 15\n   b = 21\n   \n   Since a and d are -6 so the equation\n   -6 + b - 6 = -4\n   -12 + b = -4\n   \n   And we also know \n   ab + c + d = 78\n   Then\n   (-6) * (21) + c + (-6) = 78\n   -126 + c = 84\n   c = 210\n   \n   We can now look at the system of three equations for this case:\n   1. -12 + b = -4\n   2. -126 + c = 84\n   3. 576 = b^2 + 2bc +  c^2\n   \n   We can simplify equation 1.\n   -12 + b = -4\n   b = 8\n   \n   Substituting b in equation 2.\n   -126 + c = 84\n   c = 210\n   \n   Substituting b and c in equation 3.\n   576 = (8)^2 + 2 * 8 * 210 + (210)^2\n   576 = 64 + 3360 + 44100\n   576 = 46024\n   \n   This is a contradiction, so we will not consider this case.\n\nSince the two previous cases introduced contradictions we need to consider an alternative approach.\nTo find the greatest possible value of  a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2, we use the fact that\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = (a+b)^2 + (c+d)^2 - 2(ab+cd)\nSince \n- \n(a + b) = 15\n(c + d) = -4\nand ab + cd = 78 so the expression (a + b)^2 + (c+d)^2 - 2(ab+cd) can be rewritten as follows\n(a + b)^2 + (c + d)^2 - 2(ab + cd)\n= (15)^2 + (-4)^2 - 2(78)\n= 225 + 16 - 156\n= 85.\nTherefore the greatest value for the expression is\n85.\n\n\n\n The answer is: $\\boxed{85}$}$",
  "critique": "To determine the best solution, we need to analyze each solution for correctness.\n\nSolution 1: This solution is correct. It finds the greatest possible value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ by considering the system of equations and factorizing the polynomial $f(x)$. The solution correctly calculates the value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ for each combination of $(a, b, c, d)$ and chooses the maximum value.\n\nSolution 2: This solution is also correct. It uses a different approach to find the greatest possible value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$. The solution correctly simplifies the system of equations and finds the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ that satisfy the equations.\n\nSolution 3: This solution is not correct. It tries to solve the system of equations using the quadratic formula, but it does not correctly calculate the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best solution is Solution 1.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "Note that when multiplying quadratics, terms add up similar to the equations of a system, so let\\begin{align*} p(x) &= (x^2 + ax + c)(x^2 + bx + d) \\\\ &= x^4 + (a+b)x^3 + (ab+c+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + cd \\\\ &= x^4 + 15x^3 + 78x^2 + 160x + 96 \\end{align*}Factoring $p(x)$ with the Rational Root Theorem results in $(x+4)(x+4)(x+1)(x+6)$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, we know that $x+4, x+4, x+1, x+6$ are all the linear factors of the polynomial, so the quadratic factors can only be multiplied from these linear factors.\nThere are only two possible distinct groupings (not counting rearrangements) -- $(x^2 + 8x + 16)(x^2 + 7x + 6)$ and $(x^2 + 5x + 4)(x^2 + 10x + 24)$. In the first case, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 405$, and in the second case, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 717$. The largest of the two options is $\\boxed{717}$.",
