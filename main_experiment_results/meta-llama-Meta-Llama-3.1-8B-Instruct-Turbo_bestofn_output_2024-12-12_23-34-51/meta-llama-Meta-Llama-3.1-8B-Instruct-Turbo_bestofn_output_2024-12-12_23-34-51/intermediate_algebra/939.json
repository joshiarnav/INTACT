    "To find the ordered pair $(a,b)$ of real numbers, we'll follow these steps:\n\nStep 1:  We are given two cubic polynomials and asked to find the ordered pair $(a,b)$ such that they have two distinct roots in common.\n\nStep 2:  The given polynomials can be written as:\n\n  - $x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6 = 0$\n  - $x^3 + bx^2 + 14x + 8 = 0$\n\nStep 3:  We can rewrite the first polynomial as $(x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3) = 0$, where $r_1, r_2,$ and $r_3$ are the roots.\n\nStep 4:  Multiplying the factors $(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$, we get a quadratic equation of the form $x^2 + (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1 r_2 = 0$. The coefficient of $x$ in the polynomial corresponds to $r_1 + r_2$.\n\nStep 5:  Similarly, for the second polynomial, the quadratic factor would be $x^2 + (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1 r_2 = 0$.\n\nStep 6:  The difference between the coefficients of the $x^2$ terms is $a - b$.\n\nStep 7:  The given information about having two distinct roots in common can be interpreted as the quadratic factor being the same for both polynomials.\n\nStep 8:  From the previous steps, we have the equations $a - b = 3$ and $r_1 r_2 = 3$.\n\nStep 9:  Now, we need to find the values of $a$ and $b$. To do this, we need the actual values of $r_1$ and $r_2$.\n\nStep 10:  Since the product of the roots of the first polynomial is $-6$, one of the factors has to be $-2$ or $-3$. This helps us narrow down the possibilities.\n\nStep 11:  Further, we are given that $r_1 r_2 = 3$.\n\nStep 12:  We'll perform polynomial division of the first polynomial by $(x + 3)$ to get a linear factor of $(x + 2)$.\n\nStep 13:  We can then equate the coefficients of the polynomial $x^2 + 5x + 2$ obtained during the division with the coefficients from the given second polynomial to solve for $b$.\n\nStep 14:  Solving the equations $a - b = 3$ and $5 = 14 + b$ gives us the ordered pair $(a,b)$.\n\nStep 15:  The calculations from the previous step give us $b = -9$.\n\nStep 16:  Using the equation $a - b = 3$ and the value of $b$ we just found, we can solve for $a$.\n\nStep 17:  The final ordered pair is then determined to be $\\boxed{(-6, -9)}$.",
    "To find the ordered pair $(a,b)$ of real numbers such that the given cubic polynomials have two distinct roots in common, we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Subtracting the two equations**:\nLet's subtract the second equation from the first:\n   \\[(x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) - (x^3 + bx^2 + 14x + 8)\\]\n\n   \\[= (a-b)x^2 + (-3)x + (-2)\\]\n\n   Since both polynomials have two distinct roots in common, the resulting quadratic equation must have the other one root that is common to both given polynomial equations.\n\n   \\[(a-b)x^2 - 3x - 2 = 0 \\]\n\n   We can apply the quadratic formula on the modified equation to find a relation between $a$ and $b$. The roots of a quadratic equation $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$ are given by \\(\\frac{-B \u00b1 \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}\\).

    "Let's denote the roots of the first polynomial as $r_1$, $r_2$, $r_3$ and the roots of the second polynomial as $r_1$, $r_2$, $r_4$, since the polynomials share two distinct roots.\n\nUsing Vieta's formulas, we can derive the following relations for the coefficients and roots of the first polynomial:\n1. $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -a$\n2. $r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = 11$\n3. $r_1r_2r_3 = -6$\n\nSimilarly, for the second polynomial:\n1. $r_1 + r_2 + r_4 = -b$\n2. $r_1r_2 + r_2r_4 + r_4r_1 = 14$\n3. $r_1r_2r_4 = -8$\n\nSince $r_1r_2$ is a common factor in both polynomials, we can set equation (2) of the first polynomial equal to equation (2) of the second polynomial:\n$r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = r_1r_2 + r_2r_4 + r_4r_1$\n$r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = r_2r_4 + r_4r_1$\n\nNow, let's take equation (1) of the first polynomial and equation (1) of the second polynomial:\n$r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = r_1 + r_2 + r_4$\n$r_3 = r_4$\n\nSubstituting $r_3 = r_4$ into the equation we derived from Vieta's formulas:\n$r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = r_2r_4 + r_4r_1$\n$r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = r_2r_3 + r_3r_1$\n\nThis does not give us any new information.\n\nNow, we need to look at the roots $r_3 = r_4$.

The fact that the square root term gets canceled out for a unique value of $a-b$ (or $a-b = 1$), when simplified in its standard form \\(\\frac{r\u00b1s}{a}\\) then 1 has to be either  \\(\\frac{r+a}{a}\\) or \\(\\frac{r-a}{a}\\), where \\(\\frac{r\u00b1s}{a}\\) is a solution of  \\(\\frac{3 \u00b1 \\sqrt{9 + 8(a-b)}}{2(a-b)}\\), where $r$ and $s$ can be expressed by using \\[\\frac{-(-3) \u00b1 \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(a-b)(-2)}}{2(a-b)}\\]. Given $\\frac{3 \u00b1 \\sqrt{9 + 8(a-b)}}{2(a-b)} = 1$, we must have \\(\\frac{-(-3) \u00b1 \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(a-b)(-2)}}{2(a-b)}\\) simplified as \\(\\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{9 + 8(a-b)}}{2(a-b)} = \\frac{3 \u00b1 \\sqrt{9 + 8(a-b)}}{2(a-b)}.\\) We conclude that $a-b = 1$ (When we cancel the square root in the case of $1 = \\frac{r+a}{a}$, it turns out that $(a-b = 1)$ cancels as $a$ (in this case, r) and \\(\\frac{a}{a}\\) is $1$, given that $-3+s = -3+a$ as $s$ is positive. To conclude, as $a-b = 1$, we get two given polynomial equations, or \\(\\frac{-3\u00b1 \\sqrt{9+8(a-b)}}{2(a-b)}.\\) To have $\\frac{-3 \u00b1 \\sqrt{9+8(a-b)}}{2(a-b)} = 1$, \\(\\frac{-r\u00b1s}{a}\\) as a solution for \\(\\frac{-3\u00b1 \\sqrt{9+8(a-b)}}{2(a-b)} = 1\\), we now have \\(\\frac{3\u00b1\\sqrt{9+8(a-b)}}{2(a-b)}.\\) The result as a solution for \\(\\frac{-3\u00b1 \\sqrt{9+8(a-b)}}{2(a-b)} = 1\\)) where $r$ equals 3 + \\(\\sqrt{9+8(a-b)}\\) simplifies the above as follows:\n\n   We have that either a or b must be 7 to cancel $ \\frac{3\u00b1\\sqrt{9+8(a-b)}}{2(a-b)} = 1$. \\(\\frac{3-\u00b1\\sqrt{9+8(7-b)}}{2(7-b)} = \\frac{3\u00b1 \\sqrt{9+56-8b}}{14-2b}\\) where $r$ can be represented by \\(\\frac{-3 \u00b1 \\sqrt{9 + 56 - 8b}}{14 - 2b}\\). The two values of $b$ can be calculated given \\(\\frac{-3\u00b1 \\sqrt{9 + 56 - 8b}}{14 - 2b} = 1.\\)\n\n   We have either $r = -2b$ or $r = -3 - \\sqrt{9 + 56 - 8b}$ where $r$ can be represented by \\(\\frac{3-\u00b1 \\sqrt{9+56-8b}}{14-2b}\\).\n\n   \\(\\frac{3 \u00b1 \\sqrt{65 - 8b}}{14 - 2b} -2b = 1 \\) \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{3 \u00b1 \\sqrt{65 - 8b}}{14 - 2b}  & = 2b + 1 \\\\\n3 \u00b1 \\sqrt{65 - 8b} & = (2b + 1) (14 - 2b)\n\\end{align*}\n\n   Since the result $\\frac{-3\u00b1 \\sqrt{9+56-8b}}{14-2b} $ as $\\frac{-3\u00b1 \\sqrt{9+56-8b}}{14-2b}$ as a solution (or \\(\\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9+56-8b}}{14-2b}\\)) where $b$ can be expressed by $ 2b + 1 \\pm 3 = \u00b1 6$ \\(\\pm \\sqrt{65 - 8b}\\), given $\\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{65 - 8b}}{14 - 2b} = 1$, we have $2b + 1 + 3 = 6,$ or $2b + 1 - 3 = -6,$ we can calculate $b$ using the solutions for these two equations. \\begin{align*}\n2b + 4 & = 6\\\\\n2b & = 6 - 4 = 2\\\\\nb & = 2/2 = 1\\\\\n2b - 2 & = -6\\\\\n2b & = -4\\\\\nb & = -2\n\\end{align*} To conclude (Now we know that $b = 1$ or $ b = -2$ as solutions), we now have to determine if either or both of $a$ and $b$ can be used given (Now we know that $b = 1$ or $ b = -2$ as solutions, we now have to determine if either or both of $a$ and $b$ can be used given given that we already know that $a - b = 1$ and $b = 1$ or $b = -2$), we can conclude (Now we know that $b = 1$ or $ b = -2$, we now have to determine if either or both of $a$ and $b$ can be used given that we already know that $a - b = 1$ and $b = 1$ or $b = -2$) now that $b$ can equal $1$ or $-2$ given $b$ can equal $1$ or $-2$).

  "solution": "Let $r$ and $s$ be the two common roots.  Then $r$ and $s$ are the roots of\n\\[(x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) - (x^3 + bx^2 + 14 + 8) = (a - b) x^2 - 3x - 2.\\]Note that $r$ and $s$ are also the roots of\n\\begin{align*}\n&4(x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) - 3(x^3 + bx^2 + 14x + 8) \\\\\n&= x^3 + (4a - 3b) x^2 + 2x \\\\\n&= x[x^2 + (4a - 3b) x + 2].\n\\end{align*}Since the constant coefficient of $x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6$ is nonzero, both $r$ and $s$ are non-zero.
