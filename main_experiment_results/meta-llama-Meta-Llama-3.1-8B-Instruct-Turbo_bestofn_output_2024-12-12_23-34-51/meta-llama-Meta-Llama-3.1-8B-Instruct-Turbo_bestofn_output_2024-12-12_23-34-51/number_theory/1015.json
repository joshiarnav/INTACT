    "To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we use the following rule:\n\nThe difference between the sum of the digits at the odd places and the sum of the digits at the even places must be a multiple of 11.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the number $854n526$. \n\nThe digits at the odd places are: 8, 4, n, 6.\nThe sum of these digits is: 8 + 4 + n + 6 =  18 + n.\n\nThe digits at the even places are: 5, 5, 2.\nThe sum of these digits is: 5 + 5 + 2 = 12.\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference: (18 + n) - 12 = 6 + n.\n\nThis difference must be a multiple of 11, so we can set up the equation: 6 + n = 11k, where k is an integer.\n\nSince we want to find a single value of n, we can choose the smallest positive value of k that satisfies the equation.\n\nOne possible value is k = 1: 6 + n = 11(1), which simplifies to 6 + n = 11.\n\nTo find n, we can subtract 6 from both sides: n = 11 - 6 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the value of n is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "To check if a number is divisible by 11, we use the rule: \n\n alternatingly add and subtract the digits of the number. \n If the result is divisible by 11, then the original number is divisible by 11.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the given number $854n526$.\n\nFirst, we alternate between adding and subtracting the digits:\n\n$(8 - 5 + 4 - n + 5 - 2 + 6)$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$(8 - 5 + 4 - n + 5 - 2 + 6) = 16 - n$\n\nWe want $16 - n$ to be divisible by 11. Let's list the possible values of $n$ that make $16 - n$ divisible by 11.\n\nFor $16 - n$ to be divisible by 11, the value of $n$ must be:\n$n = 16 - (11k)$ where k is an integer\n$n = 5$ when k = 1",
    "To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we use the following rule: \n\nTake the number in alternating sums of digits: \n\nThe numbers obtained are added and subtracted in an alternating pattern from one end of the number to the other: \n\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Sum = (Digit1 - Digit3 + Digit5 - Digit7 + Digit9) - (Digit2 - Digit4 + Digit6)}\n\\]\n\nIf the sum is divisible by 11, then the original number is divisible by 11.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the given seven-digit number $854n526$:\n\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Sum = (8 - 5 + n - 2 + 6) - (5 - 4 + 5)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Sum = (7 + n) - 6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Sum = 1 + n}\n\\]\n\nFor the number to be divisible by 11, the sum (1 + n) must be divisible by 11.\n\nConsidering the values n can take (0 to 9), we find that n = 10 would make the sum 11 which is divisible by 11. However, there's also a possibility that n can be negative. n can't actually be negative because the result of 1 + n could be negative and still work mathematically,  n could also be negative and still sum to work mathematically however  these values are mathematically negative. This sums description is more aware if n  is lowered however changing this, both  n and  this description are more viable with -10 for n but n is actually positive (We are replacing with mathod I could be using I described with math I described with numbers).\n\nTo verify n = 10 we calculate (1+10), (1+ 10) = 11\n\nGiven that n = -1 also gives n this choice with decimal precision being with

  "solution": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$.",
