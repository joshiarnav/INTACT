  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. However, Solution 1 is the most detailed and provides a step-by-step approach to converting 199 to base 2. It also correctly counts the number of zeros and ones, and calculates the difference y - x.\n\nSolution 2 is also correct, but it is a bit more concise than Solution 1. However, it may be less clear for someone who is not familiar with the process of converting a number to base 2.\n\nSolution 3 is correct, but it uses a different approach than Solutions 1 and 2. It involves finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the number, and then subtracting that power of 2 from the number. This approach can be useful for converting numbers to base 2, but it may be less clear than the approach used in Solutions 1 and 2.\n\nBased on the clarity and detail of the solutions, I would select Solution 1 as the best solution.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "The largest power of 2 that divides $199$ is $2^7$, which equals 128. Since $(1\\cdot 2^7)=128<199<(2\\cdot 2^7)=256$, the digit in the $2^7$ place is $1$. We know that $199-128=71$, and that $71$ can be expressed as $64+4+2+1$, or $(1\\cdot 2^6)+(1\\cdot 2^2)+(1\\cdot 2^1)+(1\\cdot 2^0)$. This means that $199_{10}=11000111_2$. Therefore, $x=3$ and $y=5$; and $y-x=5-3=\\boxed{2}$.",
