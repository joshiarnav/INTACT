    "To find the digit in the tens place of $7^{2005}$, we first need to look for a pattern in the powers of 7.\n\nLooking at the powers of 7: \n- $7^1$ = 7\n- $7^2$ = 49\n- $7^3$ = 343\n- $7^4$ = 2401\n- $7^5$ = 16807\n- $7^6$ = 117649\n- $7^7$ = 823543\n\nNow, we will consider the last two digits of the powers of 7:\n- $7^1$ ends in 07\n- $7^2$ ends in 49\n- $7^3$ ends in 43\n- $7^4$ ends in 01\n- $7^5$ ends in 07\n- $7^6$ ends in 49\n- $7^7$ ends in 43 and continues with the pattern 01, 07, 49, 43\n\nFrom the pattern, we can observe that the last two digits of powers of 7 repeat in a cycle of 4: 07, 49, 43, 01.\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when dividing 2005 by 4.\n\n2005 \u00f7 4 = 501 remainder 1\nSo the power of 7 we're interested in has the same remainder as $7^1$, which is 01 and the last digit of $7^4$ that has the remainder and since we are given that this is in decimal format each is tens place digit as an each digit.",
    "To find the tens digit of $7^{2005}$, we can look for patterns in the powers of 7. We can start by calculating the first few powers of 7 modulo 100, which will help us identify a pattern.\n\nThe powers of 7 modulo 100 are as follows:\n\n- $7^0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$\n- $7^1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{100}$\n- $7^2 \\equiv 49 \\pmod{100}$\n- $7^3 \\equiv 343 \\equiv 43 \\pmod{100}$\n- $7^4 \\equiv 43 \\cdot 7 \\equiv 301 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$\n\nNotice that $7^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$. This means that we can express higher powers of 7 using this pattern.\n\nSince $7^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$, we have:\n- $7^{2000} \\equiv (7^4)^{500} \\equiv 1^{500} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$\n- $7^{2004} \\equiv 7^{2000} \\cdot 7^4 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$\n- $7^{2005} \\equiv 7^{2004} \\cdot 7 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 7 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{100}$\n\nTherefore, when $7^{2005}$ is expressed in decimal notation, the digit in the tens place is $\\boxed{0}$.",
    "To find the digit in the tens place when $7^{2005}$ is expressed in decimal notation, we need to look for a pattern in the powers of $7$. We can start by finding the last two digits of some small powers of $7$.\n\n1. $7^1 = 07$\n2. $7^2 = 49$\n3. $7^3 = 343$, but we only need to consider the last two digits (43)\n4. $7^4 = 2401$\n\nNotice that the last two digits repeat in a cycle of 4, as we can see, the last two digits are 01 when we reach the power of 4.\n\nNow we can extend this cycle to higher powers. Because the remainders in modular arithmetic repeat, we can express the remainders for large powers as we can see remainders in smaller cycles:\n\n$7^{2005} \\equiv 7^1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod {100}$ is incorrect.  A power of 4 gives 01, which we will add to our known number to reach our main answer so instead of 7 we look at our effective cycle for 7 which is $7^{4n + k}$. The effected remainders of are remainders from $7$ are taken from the $4$- cycle remainders, we notice that remainders in modular $100$ taken from $7$ and added, remainders, are taken from $4$ - cycle remainders  that were added to the remainder of 7. Hence;\n\n effective remainders  for $2004$n +1  taken from 7 ($n > 0$)  are our effective remainder for $7^{2005}$ from 7 remainders in modular 100 are main $n -4*  499$. In particular effective remainder for $7$ 2005 in 100 remainders is $7^{4(499) + 1}$ that is $01$  from $7$ added remainder effective that is 01 $=$ remainder for 1, in the 4 cycle and remainder 1 that is added 1 our effective remainder. We conclude\n $7$ $^{2005} \\equiv  07 \\pmod {100}  we  are multiplying $4$ cycles in our effective main cycle, $01 \\equiv 1$ 7 is a remainder added that  effective our remainder effective\n $7^{2005}$'s remainder  in 100 is 07, and the tens digit in the number $7^{2005}$ is $\\boxed{0}$\n \n The $4- $ cycle of  7 is a set for effective effective remainders  A $n > 0$  we can see, are main remainders in modular 100 from are effective effective main remainders $n -4 * 499$.

  "critique": "Let's analyze each solution for correctness.\n\nSolution 1: This solution is incorrect because it incorrectly concludes that the last two digits of $7^{2005}$ are 07, when in fact, the last two digits are 07, but the solution also states that the last digit of $7^4$ has the remainder, which is 01, and then states that each digit is the tens place digit. However, this is not a clear conclusion.\n\nSolution 2: This solution is correct. It correctly identifies the pattern in the powers of 7 modulo 100 and uses it to find the remainder of $7^{2005}$ modulo 100. The solution then correctly concludes that the digit in the tens place of $7^{2005}$ is 0.\n\nSolution 3: This solution is incorrect because it is overly complicated and contains many unnecessary words. The solution tries to explain the concept of modular arithmetic and the concept of a cycle, but it does not clearly explain how these concepts are applied to the problem. The solution also contains many errors in its reasoning and conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 2",
  "solution": "Let's find the cycle of the last two digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $07, 49, 43, 01, 07, 49, 43, 01,\\ldots$ . The cycle of the last two digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 numbers long: 07, 49, 43, 01. Thus, to find the tens digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=0$ or 1 corresponds to the tens digit 0, and $R=2$ or 3 corresponds to the units digit 4). Since $2005\\div4=501R1$, the tens digit of $7^{2005}$ is $ \\boxed{0}$.",
