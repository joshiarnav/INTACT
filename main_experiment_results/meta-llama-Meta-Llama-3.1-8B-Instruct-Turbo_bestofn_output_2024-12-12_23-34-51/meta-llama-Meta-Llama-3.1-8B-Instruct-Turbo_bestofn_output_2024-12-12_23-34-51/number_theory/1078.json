    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nGiven that an integer is divided by 15 with a remainder of 7. This can be represented mathematically as:\n\nn = 15q + 7\n\nwhere n is the integer and q is an integer quotient.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the remainders when this integer (n) is divided by 3 and 5.\n\nFirst, let's divide the given equation by 3:\n\nn = 15q + 7\nn = (3*5)q + 7\n\nWhen dividing n by 3, the term 15q will be divisible by 3 without any remainder (since 3 is a factor of 15). Therefore, the only part that will contribute to the remainder is 7. Since 7 is greater than 3, it will leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.\n\nNext, let's divide the given equation by 5:\n\nn = 15q + 7\nn = (5*3)q + 7\n\nWhen dividing n by 5, the term 15q will be divisible by 5 without any remainder (since 5 is a factor of 15). Therefore, the only part that will contribute to the remainder is 7. Since 7 is greater than 5, it will leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 5.\n\nSo, the sum of the remainders when the same integer is divided by 3 and by 5 is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we'll start by using the fact that an integer divided by 15 leaves a remainder of 7.\n\nLet's say the integer is 'x'. We can express this as: \n\nx = 15q + 7 \n\nwhere 'q' is a quotient.\n\nNow, let's break down the integer 'x' into multiples of 3 and 5. Since 3 is a factor of 15, we know that 15 is a multiple of 3.\n\nSo we have: \nx = 15q + 7 \n\nTo divide 'x' by 3, we can rewrite it in terms of multiples of 3:\n\nx = (15q) + 7 \nx = (3*5q) + 7 \nx = 3(5q) + 7 \n\nNow we can see that when 'x' is divided by 3, the term 3(5q) will be perfectly divisible by 3. This leaves us with a remainder of 1 when 'x' is divided by 3.\n\nSimilarly, we can break down the integer 'x' in terms of multiples of 5:\n\nx = 15q + 7 \nx = (15q) + 7 \nx = (5*3q) + 7 \n\nAgain, the term (5*3q) will be perfectly divisible by 5. This leaves us with a remainder of 2 when 'x' is divided by 5.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the remainders when 'x' is divided by 3 and 5 is 1 + 2 = 3. \n\nSo the answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{3}$",
    "Given: The integer leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 15.\n\nWe can write the integer as: N = 15k + 7, where N is the integer and k is a non-negative integer.\n\nTo find the remainder when N is divided by 3 and 5, we need to consider two cases - one where N is exactly divisible by 3 and 5, and the other where it is not.\n\nSince N is of the form 15k + 7, the integer will not have a well-defined remainder when divided by 3 or 5 for the individual cases where k=1 or the integer N = 15+7 well isn't exactly divisible by 3 and 5.\n\nFirst let's check divisibility & remainder if N = 15k & 7: N = 15(1) + 7\n= 22\nWhen 22 is divided by 3 and 5, well isn't exactly divisible by 3 and 5.\nThe sum of remainders is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nWe notice that 22 also leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 15.\n\nLet n = the number that leaves remainder of 7 when divided by 15. well isn't exactly divisible by 3 and 5.\n This can be expressed by an equation: N = 15k + 7. & also by n = 3m + 1 & n=5j+2.\n\n Using equation n=15k+7: n = 3m + 1\n\\begin{equation}\n15k + 7 = 3m + 1\n\\end{equation}\n15k - 3m = -6\nk = (3m - 1) / 5 & m = 6 & k = 1.8. The number m well isn't exactly divisible by 5.\nThe value of m well isn't exactly divisible by 5.\nThe integer N well isn't exactly divisible by 3.\n\nIf k=2, n = 15k + 7 & n = 22 = 3m + 1\n m = 7, N is not divisible by 3.\nIf we change k = 3 so n= 15k + 7 & n = 32 & n = 5j+2\n j well isn't exactly divisible by 3.\nThe sum of remainders is 1+2= 3.\n\n well isn't exactly divisible by 3 and 5. The number can be expressed by n = 3m + 1 & n=5j+2."

  "critique": "All three solutions are mathematically correct and lead to the same answer, which is 3. However, I will analyze each solution for clarity, concision, and adherence to mathematical principles.\n\nSolution 1 is clear and concise, but it can be slightly improved by removing redundant steps and focusing on the key insight that the term 15q is divisible by both 3 and 5.\n\nSolution 2 is similar to Solution 1, but it uses a different approach to break down the integer x into multiples of 3 and 5.\n\nSolution 3 is more verbose and includes unnecessary cases and equations. It also introduces a variable n, which is not necessary, and uses it to try to prove the same point as Solutions 1 and 2.\n\nBased on the analysis, I would select Solution 1 as the best solution. It is clear, concise, and directly addresses the problem.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is: 1.",
