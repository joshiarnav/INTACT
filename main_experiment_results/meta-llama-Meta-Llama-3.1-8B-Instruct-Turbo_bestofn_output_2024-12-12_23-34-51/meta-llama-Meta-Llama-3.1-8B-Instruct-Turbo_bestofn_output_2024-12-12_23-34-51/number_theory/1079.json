    "We can start by representing the total number of people as $n$. Given the conditions: \n\n1. When the freshmen are told to line up in columns of 23, 22 people are in the last column. This indicates that $n = 23k + 22$ for some integer $k$.\n\n2. When the freshmen are told to line up in columns of 21, 14 people are in the last column. This indicates that $n = 21m + 14$ for some integer $m$.\n\nNow we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of $n$.\n\nSince $n = 23k + 22$ and $n = 21m + 14$, we can set them equal to each other: \n\n$$23k + 22 = 21m + 14$$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n$$23k - 21m = -8$$\n\nNow, we need to find integers $k$ and $m$ that satisfy this equation. We can use the method of linear Diophantine equations to solve this problem. \n\nUsing the method, we find that $k = 35$ and $m = 23$ is a solution to the equation. Substituting this into one of the original equations, we get:\n\n$$n = 23(35) + 22 = 805 + 22 = 827$$\n\nSo the total number of people in the incoming freshman class is $\\boxed{827}$.",

    "Given that when the freshmen line up in columns of 23, there are 22 people in the last column. This implies that the total number of freshmen, denoted as $n$, leaves a remainder of 22 when divided by 23.\n\nMathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n$n \\equiv 22 \\mod{23}$\n\nNow, we need to find a number that satisfies this congruence.\n\nSimilarly, when the freshmen line up in columns of 21, there are 14 people in the last column. This implies that the total number of freshmen, denoted as $n$, leaves a remainder of 14 when divided by 21.\n\nMathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n$n \\equiv 14 \\mod{21}$\n\nTo find a common number that satisfies both congruences, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). \n\nHowever, in this case, it is easier to use a systematic approach. \n\nLet's list down some multiples of 23 and their corresponding remainders when divided by 21:\n\n- $23 \\times 1 \\equiv 2 \\mod{21}$\n- $23 \\times 2 \\equiv 8 \\mod{21}$\n- $23 \\times 3 \\equiv 14 \\mod{21}$\n- $23 \\times 4 \\equiv 20 \\mod{21}$\n- $23 \\times 5 \\equiv 7 \\mod{21}$\n\nWe see that $23 \\times 3 \\equiv 14 \\mod{21}$. \n\nNow, $3 \\times 23 = 69$. But this does not satisfy the given conditions because it gives 22 people in the last column when divided by 23 and 0 people in the last column (not 14) when divided by 21.\n\nHowever, we notice that if we add 253 to 69, it gives the same remainder of 14 when divided by 21 and still leaves a remainder of 22 when divided by 23.\n\nTherefore, $n \\equiv 69 + 253 \\equiv 322 \\mod{483}$ \n\nSince the remainder when n is divided by 483 is 322, and we know that 322 + 483 gives 805, which is greater than 500, let's solve 322 + 483x = n. We see that n will be less than 500 if we make 483x = 0 because if x is zero, then n is also 322 which is less than 500. Therefore, the solution is $\\boxed{322}$."

  "solution": "If $n$ is the number of people in the incoming class, then $n$ yields a remainder of $14$ when divided by $21$. Since both 21 and 14 are divisible by 7, this means that $n$ is divisible by $7$. Define $k=n/7$, and note that $7k \\equiv 14\\pmod{21}$. Dividing by 7, we get $k\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. Multiplying by 7 again, we get $n\\equiv 14\\pmod{3}$, which implies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. So we are looking for a solution to the following system of linear congruences: \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}, \\\\\nn&\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3},\\\\\nn&\\equiv 22 \\pmod{23}. \\\\\n\\end{align*} First, we look for a solution to the last two congruences. Checking numbers that are one less than a multiple of 23, we find that 68 satisfies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $n$ which satisfy both of the last two congruences are precisely those that differ from 68 by a multiple of $3\\cdot 23=69$. Checking $68+69$, $68+2\\cdot 69$, etc. we find that $68 + 5\\cdot 69 = \\boxed{413}$ is the least positive solution to the last two congruences which is also divisible by 7. Note that, by the Chinese remainder theorem again, the solutions of the above system of three congruences are precisely the positive integers that differ from 413 by a multiple of $7\\cdot3\\cdot23=483,$ so 413 is indeed the only solution between 0 and 500.",
