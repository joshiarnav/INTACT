    "To find 3-primable positive integers less than 1000, we need to find numbers divisible by 3 that consist only of one-digit prime numbers. \n\nFirst, let's recall that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 3. \n\nThe one-digit prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nNow, let's consider the different cases:\n\n1. **Numbers with three digits:** For a number to be divisible by 3, its digits (a, b, c) must sum to a multiple of 3. Possible sums are 3, 6, 9, 12, or 15.\n\n- Sums of 3 can be achieved by using all three digits of 2 or all three digits of 3, all of which result in 222 and 333, respectively.\n- Sums of 6 can be achieved by using 2 and 3 together or three 2s and a 3, but since you cannot use the same digit more than twice, the only valid option is 222 and 225. However, since 225 is not divisible by 3, this case only counts the number 222.\n- Sums of 9 can be achieved by using 3 and 2 and 4, but since 4 is not a prime digit, this case does not count.\n- Sums of 12 can be achieved by using 4 or 7 digits, but neither 4 nor 7 can be used, so this case does not count.\n- Sums of 15 can be achieved by using 3, 5, and 7, so the valid option is 357.",

    "To find 3-primable integers less than 1000, we need to consider integers that are divisible by 3 and have digits that are one-digit primes (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\nLet's consider the units digit first. The units digit of a 3-primable number can be either 2, 3, 5, or 7. However, a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n\nNow let's consider the possible combinations of units digit (2, 3, 5, 7) and the sum of digits that are divisible by 3.\n\n1. If the units digit is 2, the sum of the digits should be 1 or 4 (1+2 = 3, 4+3+2 = 9, 4+5+2 = 11 is not valid).\n2. If the units digit is 3, the sum of the digits should be 0, 3, 6 or 9 (0, 6+3 = 9, 9 + 5 + 3 = 17 is not valid).\n3. If the units digit is 5, the sum of the digits should be 1, 4 or 7 (1+3+5 = 9, 4+2+5 = 11, 7+3+5 = 15 are valid).\n4. If the units digit is 7, the sum of the digits should be 2, 5 or 8 (2+3+7 = 12, 5+2+7 = 14, 5+5+7 = 17 are not valid, 8+3+7 = 18 but for a unit digit of 7, the numbers cannot end in 8, 0 or 3, only 0, 3, 6, 0, 3, 6 are possible units to digit 7 but only in the 3+3+7 = 13 and the 5+3+7 = 15 are away, but 3+2+7 = 12, 5+2+7 = 14).\n\nNow let's consider the tens digit. A 3-primable number should have a sum of digits that is divisible by 3.\n\nThe sums of digits that we have are:\n- 1: No valid 2-digit numbers\n- 4: 3+1 or 7+1, 0+4 (but since we only care about 3-primable numbers we only care about the 3+1)\n- 9: 3+5+1 or 3+6+0 or 4+5 +0 but only the numbers 321 and 351 and  360,  621 and  630  and  453 and  450 and  756 and  750 are feasible \n- 12: Only possible for the numbers  3+2+7 = 3+2+7 =  321,  2+3+7, the numbers  0+3+9 are not valid for the set 0 + 3 + 9 as the conventional digit 0 would make 09 which is even so we can ignore 003, we could go

This only leaves us with 7 + 7 + 0 is not valid, 6 + 6 + 6, is also not valid, we are not getting 6 or 9 in this way that are valid.)\n- 21 (5 + 7 + 9, but 9 is not valid, so 3 + 7 + 3, and 5 + 7 + 9 is not valid, because 9 is not valid, but 7 + 7 + 7)\n- 24 (only 2 + 7 + 5 and 5 + 7 + 2 and 7 + 2 + 5)\n- 27 (3 + 3 + 3 + 3, is not valid, because it is more than three, but 5 + 5 + 7, 7 + 5 + 5, 3 + 7 + 7, 7 + 7 + 3, 7 + 3 + 7, 3 + 5 + 7, 5 + 7 + 3, 7 + 3 + 5, 5 + 3 + 7 and 7 + 5 + 3)\n- 30 (only 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 is not valid, because it is too big, that leaves 7 + 7 + 3 + 3, 7 + 3 + 7 + 3, 3 + 7 + 7 + 3, 7 + 3 + 3 + 7, 3 + 7 + 3 + 7, 3 + 3 + 7 + 7, 7 + 7 + 7 + 3, 7 + 3 + 7 + 7, 7 + 7 + 3 + 7, 3 + 7 + 7 + 7, 3 + 7 + 7 + 3 but all of those are 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 is not valid, because we did that before)\n- 33 (only 3 + 3 + 3 + 7, 3 + 3 + 7 + 3, 3 + 7 + 3 + 3, 7 + 3 + 3 + 3)\n- 36 (only 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3)\n- 39 (only 3 + 7 + 7 + 3)\n- 42 (only 7 + 5 + 7 + 3, 7 + 7 + 5 + 3, 7 + 3 + 5 + 7, 7 + 3 + 7 + 5, 7 + 5 + 7 + 3, 7 + 7 + 7 + 3)\n- 45 (only 3 + 7 + 5 + 5)\n- 48 (only 5 + 5 + 7 + 3, 5 + 7 + 5 + 3, 5 + 7 + 3 + 5, 3 + 5 + 5 + 5)\n- 51 (only 7 + 7 + 7 + 3, 7 + 3 + 7 + 7)\n- 54 (only 5 + 7 + 5 + 5)\n- 57 (only 5 + 5 + 7 + 3, 5 + 7 + 5 + 3, 5 + 7 + 3 + 5, 3 + 5 + 5 + 5)\n- 60 (5 + 7 + 5 + 5, 5 + 5 + 7 + 5, 5 + 5 + 5 + 7)\n- 63 (7 + 7 + 7 + 3, 7 + 3 + 7 + 7)\n- 66 (7 + 7 + 7 + 7)\n- 69 (6 + 7 + 7 + 7, but we can't have 6 in this context, we've covered all possibilities for 6, using 2,3,5,7.)\n- 72 (5 + 7 + 7 + 3, 7 + 5 + 7 + 3, 7 + 7 + 5 + 3, 7 + 3 + 5 + 7, 7 + 3 + 7 + 5, 7 + 5 + 7 + 3, 7 + 7 + 7 + 3)\n- 75 (7 + 7 + 5 + 3, 7 + 3 + 5 + 7, 5 + 7 + 3 + 7)\n- 78 (7 + 5 + 5 + 7, 5 + 5 + 7 + 7, 5 + 7 + 5 + 7)\n- 81 (7 + 7 + 7 + 3, 7 + 3 + 7 + 7)\n- 84 (7 + 3 + 7 + 7, 7 + 7 + 3 + 7, 7 + 7 + 7 + 3, 7 + 7 + 7 + 3, 7 + 3 + 7 + 7, 7 + 7 + 3 + 7, 3 + 7 + 7 + 7)\n- 87 (3 + 7 + 7 + 7, 7 + 3 + 7 + 7, 7 + 7 + 3 + 7, 7 + 7 + 7 + 3)\n- 90 (5 + 5 + 5 + 7, 5 + 5 + 7 + 5, 5 + 7 + 5 + 5, 7 + 5 + 5 + 5)\n- 93 (7 + 7 + 7 + 3, 7 + 3 + 7 + 7)\n- 96 is not valid because we can't use 6 in any combination with 2,3,5,7\n- 99 is not valid, because we can't use 9, which is not one-digit prime.\n\nNow we need to make sure that we haven't double counted any number.\n\n- 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 is the same number, which is 33.\n- 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 is the same number, which is 77.\n- 3 + 7 + 3 + 7, 7 + 3 + 3 + 7, 7 + 3 + 7 + 3, are the same, which is 33.\n- 7 + 7 + 7 + 3, 7 + 3 + 7 + 7 are the same, which is 77.\n- 5 + 7 + 5 + 7 is the same, which is 57.\n- 5 + 5 + 7 + 3 is the same, which is 53.\n- 5 + 5 + 5 + 7 is the same, which is 57.\n- 7 + 3 + 7 + 7 is the same, which is 73.\n- 7 + 7 + 3 + 7, 7 + 7 + 7 + 3 is the same, which is 77.\n- 7 + 3 + 5 + 7, 7 + 5 + 3 + 7 are the same, which is 73.\n- 5 + 7 + 3 + 5, 5 + 3 + 7 + 5, 3 + 5 + 7 + 5}$",
  "critique": "Let's analyze each solution for correctness.\n\nSolution 1 is mostly correct, but it has a few errors in the cases where the sum of the digits is 12 or 15. It incorrectly states that the only valid option for a sum of 12 is 7 + 5, and it also incorrectly states that the only valid option for a sum of 15 is 3 + 5 + 7.\n\nSolution 2 is also mostly correct, but it has a lot of unnecessary cases and some errors in the cases where the sum of the digits is 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, and 99. It also has some repeated cases.\n\nSolution 3 is also mostly correct, but it has some errors in the cases where the sum of the digits is 4, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, and 99. It also has some repeated cases.\n\nAfter analyzing each solution, I would say that Solution 1 is the best solution. It has the fewest errors and the most straightforward approach.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1, which has an index number of 1.",
  "solution": "The one-digit prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7. A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. So we want to count the number of ways we can pick three or fewer of these digits that add up to a multiple of 3 and form a number with them. We will use modular arithmetic. Of our allowable digits, $3 \\equiv 0$, $7 \\equiv 1$, $2\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, and $5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. The ways to add up 3 or fewer numbers to get 0 modulo 3 are shown:\n\n1. 0\n\n2. 0 + 0\n\n3. 1 + 2\n\n4. 0 + 0 + 0\n\n5. 1 + 1 + 1\n\n6. 2 + 2 + 2\n\n7. 0 + 1 + 2\n\nWe will count the number of 3-primable integers each case produces:\n\n1. There is 1 number, 3.\n\n2. There is 1 number, 33.\n\n3. One of the digits is 7, and the other digit is either 2 or 5. So there are 2 choices for this digit, and once the digit is chosen, there are 2 ways to arrange the digits of the 3-primable number (for example, if we choose the digit 2, then we could either have 72 or 27). So there are $(2)(2) = 4$ numbers in this case.\n\n4. There is 1 number, 333.\n\n5. There is 1 number, 777.\n\n6. Each of the three digits is either 2 or 5. This gives $2^3 = 8$ numbers.\n\n7. One of the digits is 3, one of the digits is 7, and the other digit is either 2 or 5. Once we choose either 2 or 5, there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the digits of the 3-primable number. So there are $2(6) = 12$ numbers in this case.\n\nSo in total, our answer is $1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 8 + 12 = \\boxed{28}$.",
