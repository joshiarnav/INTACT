    "To find the value of $b$, we will perform addition on the given numbers in base $b$ and equate the result with the given equation. Then we will solve for $b$.\n\nGiven equation: $161_{b}+134_{b}=315_{b}$\n\nWe can write these numbers in their expanded forms as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n161_b &= 1\\times b^2 + 6\\times b + 1 \\\\\n134_b &= 1\\times b^2 + 3\\times b + 4\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nPerforming the addition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(1\\times b^2 + 6\\times b + 1) + (1\\times b^2 + 3\\times b + 4) &= 315_b \\\\\n2b^2 + 9b + 5 &= 315_b\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe need to convert $315_b$ into its expanded form to make a comparison. The value of $315_b$ can be written as $3\\times b^2 + 1\\times b + 5$.\n\nSo we have:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2b^2 + 9b + 5 &= 3b^2 + b + 5\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSubtracting $2b^2 + 9b + 5$ from both sides:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 &= b^2 - 8b\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFactoring $b$ from the equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nb(b-8) &= 0 \n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSetting each factor to zero to find the solution for $b$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nb-8 &= 0 \\\\\nb &= 8\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $b$ is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "To find the value of b, we can start by analyzing the given equation:\n\n$161_{b}+134_{b}=315_{b}$\n\nWe can convert each number from base b to a place value system with powers of b.

    "To find the value of $b$, we will convert the given numbers to their decimal form and solve the equation.\n\n1. Convert the numbers from base $b$ to their decimal form.\n\n   $161_b = b^2 + 6b + 1$\n   $134_b = b^2 + 3b + 4$\n   $315_b = 3b^2 + 1b + 5$\n\n2. Substitute these expressions into the given equation:\n   $b^2 + 6b + 1 + b^2 + 3b + 4 = 3b^2 + 1b + 5$\n\n3. Simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n   $2b^2 + 9b + 5 = 3b^2 + 1b + 5$\n\n4. Rearrange the equation so that one side equals zero:\n   $0 = 3b^2 + 1b + 5 - (2b^2 + 9b + 5)$\n   $0 = 3b^2 + 1b + 5 - 2b^2 - 9b - 5$\n   $0 = b^2 - 8b$\n\n5. Factor out the greatest common factor and solve for $b$:\n   $0 = b(b - 8)$\n   This gives us $b = 0$ or $b = 8$, but since $b$ is the base of a number system, it cannot be zero. Therefore, $b = 8$ is the only valid solution to the equation.\n\nSo, the value of $b$ is:\n\n$\\boxed{8}$"
