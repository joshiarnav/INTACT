    "To find the sum of all integer values of n such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer, we need to find all the odd divisors of 20.\n\n1. First, let's list all the odd divisors of 20: 1 and 5. \n\n2. Now, we need to find the integer values of n such that $2n-1$ equals these odd divisors. \n\n   - For $2n-1 = 1$, we have $2n=2$ and $n = 1$.\n   - For $2n-1 = 5$, we have $2n=6$ and $n=3$.\n\n3. Since $2n-1$ will be even if n is even, the values of n must be odd.\n\n4. Now, we will sum all the odd values of n: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, the sum of all integer values of n such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer is $\\boxed{4}$.",

  "solution": "The expression $2n-1$ is odd for every integer $n$, and conversely every odd integer takes the form $2n-1$ for some integer $n$.  Therefore, there is one solution $n$ for each (not necessarily positive) odd divisor of 20.  The positive odd divisors of 20 are 1 and 5, so we solve $2n-1=-5$, $2n-1=-1$, $2n-1=1$, and $2n-1=5$ to find the solutions $n=-2$, $n=0$, $n=1$, and $n=3$.
