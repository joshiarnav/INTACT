    "To find the residue of the expression $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$, we can break it down into smaller steps.\n\nStep 1: Evaluate $182\\cdot 12\\pmod{14}$\n\nWe first reduce 182 modulo 14. \n$182\\pmod{14} \\equiv 0$ since 182 is a multiple of 14.\nSo, $182\\cdot 12 \\pmod{14}$ becomes $0\\cdot 12 \\pmod{14}$, which is $0\\pmod{14}$.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate $15\\cdot 7\\pmod{14}$\n\nWe first reduce 15 modulo 14.\n$15\\pmod{14} \\equiv 1$ since 15 is congruent to 1 modulo 14.\nSo, $15\\cdot 7 \\pmod{14}$ becomes $1\\cdot 7\\pmod{14}$, which is $7\\pmod{14}$.\n\nStep 3: Substitute the results back into the original expression\n\nWe have $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\pmod{14}$ is equivalent to $0 - 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$.\n\nStep 4: Simplify the expression\n\nNow we can simplify the expression.\n$0 - 7 + 3 \\pmod{14} \\equiv -4\\pmod{14}$.\n\nWe need to find the positive residue of -4 modulo 14.\n\nTo do this, we can add 14 to -4 until we get a positive number less than 14. \n$-4 + 14 = 10$, which is a positive number less than 14.\n\nSo, the residue of the expression $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$ is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "To find the residue of the given expression modulo 14, we'll break it down step by step.\n\n1. First, let's calculate the product of 182 and 12:\n\n   182 * 12 = 2184\n\n   Next, let's find the residue of 2184 modulo 14. To do this, we divide 2184 by 14:\n\n   2184 \u00f7 14 = 156 remainder 0\n\n   So, the residue of 182 * 12 modulo 14 is 0.\n\n2. Now, let's calculate the product of 15 and 7:\n\n   15 * 7 = 105\n\n   Next, let's find the residue of 105 modulo 14. To do this, we divide 105 by 14:\n\n   105 \u00f7 14 = 7 remainder 7\n\n   So, the residue of 15 * 7 modulo 14 is 7.\n\n3. The last term in the expression is 3. To find the residue of 3 modulo 14, we don't need to perform any calculations because 3 is already less than 14. The residue of 3 modulo 14 is simply 3.\n\nNow, let's combine these results to find the residue of the entire expression modulo 14:\n\n(182 * 12) - (15 * 7) + 3 \u2261 0 - 7 + 3 (mod 14)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-4\n\nSince -4 is negative, we can add 14 to it to get a positive equivalent residue without changing its equivalence class:\n\n-4 + 14 = 10\n\nNow, we have our answer:\n\nThe residue is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "To find the residue of the expression $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3$ modulo 14, we can break it down into smaller steps:\n\n1. First, calculate $182\\cdot 12$:\nSince $182\\cdot 12$ can be broken down into $14\\cdot 13$ and $12\\cdot 182$ = $14\\cdot 13+14$ which simplifies to $14\\cdot15$ \n$14\\cdot 15 = 210$\n\n2. Then, we find the residue of $210\\pmod{14}$. \nWe can divide 210 by 14 and find the remainder, which is $210 - (14\\cdot 15)$ = $210-210$ = 0.  \nThus, the residue of $182\\cdot 12\\pmod{14}$ is 0.\n\n3. Next, we need to find the residue of $-15\\cdot 7 \\pmod{14}$. \n$-15\\cdot 7$ is the same as ($-1\\cdot15)\\cdot 7$  \nSince $15\\equiv1 \\pmod{14}$ \n$(-1\\cdot15)\\cdot7 \\equiv -7 \\pmod{14}$. \nWe can see that the residue of $-7\\pmod{14}$ is 7, ($-7 +14 = 7$), so the residue of $-15\\cdot7 \\pmod{14}$ is 7.\n\n4. Finally, we need to find the residue of $3\\pmod{14}$.  \nSince $3 < 14$, the residue of $3\\pmod{14}$ is 3.\n\n5. Putting it all together, we have: \n$182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$\n$ \\equiv -4\\pmod{14}$\nSince $-4$ is equivalent to $10 \\pmod{14}$, our final answer is \n $\\boxed{10}$."

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I found that all three solutions are correct and yield the same result, which is 10.

  "solution": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7. So the residue of the sum is  $$\n182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\equiv \\boxed{10} \\pmod{14}.\n$$",
