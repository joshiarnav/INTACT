    "To find the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the two-digit multiples of 7**: The first two-digit multiple of 7 is 14 and the last one is 98. To find all the multiples, we can use the formula for an arithmetic progression:\n   - Start: 14\n   - Common difference: 7\n   - Last term: 98\n\n2. **Determine the number of terms**: We can find the number of terms using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic progression:\n   - $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$\n   - Replace $a_n$ with 98 and $a_1$ with 14\n   -  $98 = 14 + (n - 1) \\cdot 7$\n   -  $84 = (n - 1) \\cdot 7$\n   -  $n-1=12$\n   -  $n=13$\n\n   There are 13 terms in this arithmetic progression.\n\n3. **Find the sum of the terms**: We can use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic progression:\n   - $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$\n   - Replace $S_n$ with the sum of the terms, $n$ with 13, $a_1$ with 14, and $a_n$ with 98\n   - sum = $\\frac{13}{2}(14 + 98)$\n   - sum = $\\frac{13}{2}(112)$\n   - sum = 728\n\n4. **Calculate the mean**: Now that we have the sum of the terms, we can find the mean by dividing the sum by the number of terms:\n   - mean = $\\frac{sum}{13}$\n   - mean = $\\frac{728}{13}$\n   - mean = 56.00\n\nSo, the arithmetic mean of all the positive two-digit multiples of 7 is $\\boxed{56}$.",
    "To find the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the smallest and largest two-digit multiples of 7**: \n   The smallest two-digit multiple of 7 is 14, and the largest is 98 (since 7 * 14 = 98).\n\n2. **Determine the total count of multiples**: \n   We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term (14 in this case), d is the common difference (7 in this case), and n is the number of terms. \n   We want the last term to be 98, so we plug in the values and solve for n.\n   98 = 14 + (n-1)(7)\n   84 = (n-1)(7)\n   n-1 = 12\n   n = 13\n\n   Therefore, there are 13 two-digit multiples of 7.\n\n3. **Find the sum of all the multiples**: \n   We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S_n = (n/2)(a_1 + a_n), where S_n is the sum, n is the number of terms, a_1 is the first term, and a_n is the nth term.\n   S_n = (13/2)(14 + 98)\n   S_n = (13/2)(112)\n   S_n = 728\n\n   Alternatively, we can express the sum as:\n   7(2 + 3 + 4 + ... + 13 + 14)\n   7 * (number of terms in sum from 2 to 14)\n   The sum of a series of consecutive integers from 2 to n, (2 + 3 + 4 + ... + n), can be found with the following formula:\n   sum = (n * (n + 1))/2\n   number of terms in sum from 2 to 14\n   sum = (14 * (14 + 1))/2\n   sum =  (14 * 15)/2\n   sum = 105\n   Since there is an additional term, the actual number of terms in sum from 2 to 14 is 105 + 1 = 106.\n   Since this also includes 2, then:\n   7 * (14 + 105)\n   7 * (119)\n   7 * (2 * 59 + 1)\n   7 * (2 * 59) + 7 * 1\n   Since this is also the same method in which the previous equation was written, then this sum also equals 7 * (2 * 59 + 1)\n   Therefore, the sum of all the multiples is:\n   7 * (2 * 59 + 1)\n   sum also equals 7 * 119\n   Therefore, the sum of all the multiples is also 833/7 * 7 and also 728, with the standard method equalling 833 - 105 = 728 as well\n\n4. **Calculate the arithmetic mean**: \n   The arithmetic mean is equal to the sum of all the multiples divided by the total count of multiples.\n   Mean = Sum / Count\n   Mean = 728 / 13\n   Mean = 56.00 \n\nTherefore, the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7 is:\n\n$\\boxed{56.00}$",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. However, Solution 1 is the most straightforward and easy to follow. It clearly explains each step and uses the formulas for an arithmetic progression to find the sum and mean. Solution 2 also uses the formulas correctly but has some unnecessary steps and calculations. Solution 3 is a bit more concise but still clearly explains each step.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
