    "To find the value of $a$ and $b$, we first need to convert the given number $656_7$ from base-7 to base-10.\n\nIn the base-7 number system, each digit can have 7 values (0-6). We will evaluate the number as follows:\n\n$656_7 = (6 \\times 7^2) + (5 \\times 7^1) + (6 \\times 7^0)$\n\n$= (6 \\times 49) + (5 \\times 7) + (6 \\times 1)$\n\n$= 294 + 35 + 6$\n\n$= 335$\n\nSince we have $656_7=335_{10}$, we know the first two digits $ab$ of the base-10 number are $3$ and $3$. \n\nTherefore, $a= 3$ and $b= 3$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of $\\frac{a\\cdot b}{15}$:\n\n$\\frac{a\\cdot b}{15} = \\frac{3\\cdot 3}{15}$\n\n$= \\frac{9}{15}$\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.\n\n$\\frac{9}{15} = \\frac{3}{5}$",

    "To convert the number $656_7$ from base 7 to base 10, we need to multiply each digit by the corresponding power of 7 and add them up.\n\n$656_7 = (6 \\times 7^2) + (5 \\times 7^1) + (6 \\times 7^0)$\n\nNow let's calculate the values:\n\n$7^2 = 49$, so $6 \\times 49 = 294$\n\n$7^1 = 7$, so $5 \\times 7 = 35$\n\n$7^0 = 1$, so $6 \\times 1 = 6$\n\nNow, let's add these values up:\n\n$294 + 35 + 6 = 335$\n\nSo, $656_7 = 335_{10}$.\n\nWe are given that $656_7 = 3ab_{10}$, and now we know that $656_7 = 335_{10}$.

Since we know that $a = 3$, which is part of the 300, we can look at the remaining parts to find the value of $b$. \n\nThe remaining parts are 30 and 5, and $b$ will be the units digit of these two parts.
