  "all_solutions": [
    "To find the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiple of 25:** Any multiple of 25 must end in 00, 25, 50, or 75. \n\n2. **Product of Digits:** To be a multiple of 25, the product of its digits must have at least one 5. Since 25 is the product, and at least one of the endings ends with either 25 or 75, we must consider both cases.\n\n3. **Least Multiple:** We need the least positive multiple, so the smallest ending to consider is 25 (since it's smaller than 75). The smallest multiple with the 25 at the end is 125. \n\n4. **Product of Digits:** However, the product of its digits is 1 * 2 * 5 = 10, which is not a multiple of 25.\n\n5. **Alternative:** Considering the next possible ending as 75, the smallest multiple with the 75 at the end is 275. \n\n6. **Product of Digits:** The product of its digits is 2 * 7 * 5 = 70, which is not a multiple of 25.\n\n7. **Next Ending:** The next smallest ending to consider is 50. The smallest multiple with the 50 at the end is 250.\n\n8. **Product of Digits:** The product of its digits is 2 * 5 * 0 = 0, which is a multiple of 25.\n\nSo, the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25 is $\\boxed{250}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to find the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25.\n\nSince the product of the digits must be a multiple of 25, the digits must include at least two factors of 5, as 5 * 5 = 25.\n\nLet's look at the multiples of 25 and find the smallest number that has two factors of 5 in its digits:\n\n1. 25 (but 2*5 is not a multiple of 25)\n2. 50 (but 5*0 is not a multiple of 25)\n3. 75 (here, 7*5 = 35, which is not a multiple of 25)\n4. 100 (here, 1*0*0 = 0 which is a multiple of 25)\n5. 125 (here, 1*2*5 = 10 which is a multiple of 25)\n6. 150 (here, 1*5*0 = 0, which is a multiple of 25)\n7. 175 (here, 1*7*5 = 35 which is not a multiple of 25)\n8. 200 (Here, 2*0*0 = 0, which is a multiple of 25)\n\nWe can see that 200 satisfies this condition, as its digits 2, 0, 0 form a product equal to 0 which is a multiple of 25. Hence our final answer: $\\boxed{200}$",
    "To find the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25, we need to find a number that meets two conditions:\n\n1. It is a multiple of 25.\n2. The product of its digits is a multiple of 25.\n\nThe first condition means that the number ends in 00, 25, 50, or 75.\n\nThe second condition means that the product of the digits must be a multiple of 25, which means it must contain at least two factors of 5. We can try various numbers.\n\nIf a number ends in 00, the product of its digits will be 0, and 0 is not a multiple of 25.\n\nIf a number ends in 25, the product of its digits will be 25 (if there is no other digit), which is a multiple of 25.\n\nIf a number ends in 50, the product of its digits will be 10 (if there is no other digit), which is not a multiple of 25.\n\nIf a number ends in 75, the product of its digits will be 0 (if there is no other digit), which is not a multiple of 25.\n\nHowever, if we look at numbers like 525 or 275, and their digit products, they are 25 times 5 and 25 times 7, which are both not a multiple of 25.\n\nHowever, for a number to be a multiple of 25 and to also have a digit product which is a positive multiple of 25, we need to require two fives for the product to be a multiple of 25. \n\nTherefore, for the product of the digits to be a multiple of 25, we need at least one of the two fives to be included.\n\nLooking at the options for multiples of 25. The first that has two fives is 525. \n\nThe number 525 is a multiple of 25, which is correct, but the digit product of the number 525 is 5*2*5, which is equal to 50.  This is not a positive multiple of 25.\n\nLooking at multiples of 25. We also have 275, 475, 625, 725, and 975 and so on.\n\nWe are also given that the first multiple that has a product of its digits that is a multiple of 25 is 525 but is not a correct answer.\n\nThen looking at the digit products of these.\n\nFor 275, the product of digits is 7 * 2 * 5, which is not a positive multiple of 25.\n\nFor 475, the product of digits is 4 * 7 * 5, which is not a positive multiple of 25.\n\nFor 625, the product of digits is 6 * 2 * 5, which is not a positive multiple of 25.\n\nFor 725, the product of digits is 7 * 2 * 5, which is not a positive multiple of 25.\n\nFor 975, the product of digits is 9 * 7 * 5, which is not a positive multiple of 25.\n\nFor 525 we already found the digit product of the number was not a positive multiple of 25.\n\nTherefore, we have to try the next multiple.\n\nLooking at multiples of 25. We also have 475 * 2, 475 * 5, 475 * 10, 475 * 25 = 11875.\n\nThe number 11875 is a multiple of 25, which is correct.\n\n\nThe product of the digits for 11875 is  1 * 1 * 8 * 7 * 5, which is equal to 280.\n\n\nTherefore, 280 is not a positive multiple of 25.\n\n\nBut for the number 525 * 2.\n\nIf we multiply 525 by 2 we get 525 * 2 = 1050.\n\n\n\nIf we multiply 1050 by 2 we get 2100, this could be the answer we are looking for.\n\n\n\nFor the number 2100. It is a multiple of 25 as 2100 * 1/100 = 21, therefore we can divide by 100.\n\n\nTherefore, for 2100, we have:\n\n1*2* 1*0, which is equal to 0.\n\n\nTherefore, for the number 2100, we need to check other numbers that are multiples of 25.\n\n\n\nTherefore, we will check 525 * 5 which is 525 * 6 equals 3150.\n\n\n\nFor 3150. We have:\n\n3*1*5*0, which is equal to 0.\n\n\nTherefore, this number does not meet our criteria.\n\nWe will try to find another multiple.\n\nIf we multiply 475, by 2 we get 950.\n\nIf we multiply 950, by 2 we get, 1900.\n\nIf we multiply 190, by 10 we get 1900.\n\n\n\nIf we multiply 1900 by 2.\n\n\nWe get 3800.\n\n\nTherefore, for 3800. We have:\n\n3*8*0*0, which is equal to 0.\n\n\n\nWe will try to find another multiple.\n\n\nIf we multiply 475 by 6 = 2850.\n\n\n\nIf we multiply 2850 by 2.  We get:\n\n5700.\n\n\n\nTherefore, for 5700. We have:\n\n\n5*7*0*0, which is equal to 0.\n\n\nTherefore, this number does not meet our criteria."

  "critique": "Let's analyze each solution for correctness:\n\nSolution 1: This solution correctly identifies the possible endings for a multiple of 25 (00, 25, 50, or 75) and checks each one to find the smallest number that meets the condition. It correctly identifies 250 as the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25.\n\nSolution 2: This solution also correctly identifies the need for at least two factors of 5 in the product of the digits to be a multiple of 25. However, it incorrectly identifies 200 as the smallest number that meets this condition, when in fact 250 is the smallest number that meets this condition.\n\nSolution 3: This solution also correctly identifies the need for at least two factors of 5 in the product of the digits to be a multiple of 25.

It eventually identifies 2100 as a possible solution, but it is not the smallest number that meets this condition.\n\nBased on the analysis, Solution 1 is the best solution, as it correctly identifies the smallest number that meets the condition.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "Every multiple of 25 ends in 00, 25, 50, or 75.  Since we want the product of the digits to be a positive multiple of 25, the final two digits must be either 25 or 75.\n\nA nonzero product of digits is a multiple of 25 exactly when two or more of the digits is are equal to 5. If a number ends in 75 and the product of its digits is a multiple of 25, then replacing 75 by 25 in that number will also give a smaller number whose product of digits is a multiple of 25.  Therefore we are looking for a number whose final two digits are 25 and for which 5 is one of the other digits.\n\nSince 525 is the smallest such number, the answer must be $\\boxed{525}$.",
