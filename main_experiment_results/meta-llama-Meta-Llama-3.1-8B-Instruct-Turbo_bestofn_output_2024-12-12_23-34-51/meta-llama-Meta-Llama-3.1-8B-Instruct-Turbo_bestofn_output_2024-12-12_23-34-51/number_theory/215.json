    "To find the units digit of $13^{2003}$, let's consider the pattern of the units digits of the powers of 13. \n\nThe units digit of $13^1$ is 3. \n\nThe units digit of $13^2$ is $13 \\times 13 \\equiv 1 \\mod 10$ since we are only concerned with the units digit, so $13^2$ has a units digit of 1. \n\nThe units digit of $13^3$ would be the units digit of $13^2 \\times 13$, which is 1 times 3, resulting in 3.\n\nNow, we can observe a pattern. Every odd power of 13 has a units digit of 3 and every even power of 13 has a units digit of 1. \n\nThe exponent 2003 is an odd number. Therefore, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is 3.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "To find the units digit of $13^{2003}$, let's first look at the pattern of units digits for powers of 13. \n\nWe can start by calculating the units digits of the first few powers of 13: \n\n- $13^1$ = 13 (units digit: 3)\n- $13^2$ = 169 (units digit: 9)\n- $13^3$ = 2197 (units digit: 7)\n- $13^4$ = 28,561 (units digit: 1)\n\nWe can see that the units digits repeat in a cycle of 4: 3, 9, 7, 1.\n\nNow, let's find out where $13^{2003}$ falls in this cycle. To do this, we can find the remainder when the exponent (2003) is divided by 4.\n\n2003 \u00f7 4 = 500 remainder 3.\n\nSo, the remainder is 3. Since the units digit of $13^3$ is 7, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ will be 7.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "To find the units digit of $13^{2003}$, we need to look for a pattern in the units digits of the powers of 13.\n\n1. Let's calculate the first few powers of 13:\n   - $13^1 = 13$ (units digit: 3)\n   - $13^2 = 169$ (units digit: 9)\n   - $13^3 = 2197$ (units digit: 7)\n   - $13^4 = 28561$ (units digit: 1)\n   - $13^5 = 371293$ (units digit: 3)\n\n   As we can see, the units digits of the powers of 13 repeat every 4 powers: 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1, ...\n\n2. Now, let's find the remainder when 2003 is divided by 4 (since the pattern repeats every 4 powers):\n   - $2003 \\div 4 = 500$ with a remainder of 3\n\n3. Since 2003 has a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, the power $13^{2003}$ will have the same units digit as $13^3$.\n\n4. We already calculated that the units digit of $13^3$ is 7.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$."

  "critique": "Solution 1 is incorrect because it states that every odd power of 13 has a units digit of 3 and every even power of 13 has a units digit of 1, which is not true. The pattern actually repeats every 4 powers: 3, 9, 7, 1.\n\nSolution 2 and Solution 3 are correct because they both identify the repeating pattern of units digits (3, 9, 7, 1) and use it to find the units digit of $13^{2003}$. They both correctly conclude that the remainder when 2003 is divided by 4 is 3, and therefore the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is 7.\n\nBetween Solution 2 and Solution 3, Solution 2 is a slightly better solution because it is more concise and easier to follow. It also avoids repeating the same calculation multiple times, as Solution 3 does.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 2",
  "solution": "Powers of 13 have the same units digit as the corresponding powers of 3; and $$\n3^1 = 3, \\quad 3^2 = 9, \\quad 3^3 = 27, \\quad 3^4 = 81, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 3^5 = 243.\n$$Since the units digit of $3^1$ is the same as the units digit of $3^5$, units digits of powers of 3 cycle through $3, 9, 7,$ and $1$. Hence the units digit of $3^{2000}$ is $1$, so the units digit of $3^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$. The same is true of the units digit of $13^{2003}$.",
