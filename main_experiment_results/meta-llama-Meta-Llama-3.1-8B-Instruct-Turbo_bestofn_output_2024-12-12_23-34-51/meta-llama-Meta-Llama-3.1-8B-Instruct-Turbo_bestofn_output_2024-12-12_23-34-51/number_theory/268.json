    "To solve the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$, we need to find a solution $x$ that satisfies the equation.\n\nStep 1: Since the coefficient of $x$ (4) and the modulus (27) are not coprime (they have a common factor of 1), we can start by checking whether the modulus is a multiple of the coefficient. However, 4 is not a factor of 27, thus we continue with the approach below.\n\nStep 2: We need to find the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27. This means finding a number $a$ such that $4a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}$.\n\nStep 3: To find the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm or trial and error method. \n\nWe can start by trying numbers of the form $27k+1$ (where $k$ is an integer), and check which one is divisible by 4.\n\nFor $k=1$, $27(1)+1=28$, which is divisible by 4 (since $28=4(7)$). But 28 is not the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27.\n\nFor $k=2$, $27(2)+1=55$, which is not divisible by 4.\n\nFor $k=3$, $27(3)+1=82$, which is divisible by 4 (since $82=4(20)$ with a remainder). But 82 is not the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27.\n\nFor $k=4$, $27(4)+1=109$, which is not divisible by 4.\n\nThis slow process can be expedited using a calculator or the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for a generic n; the inverse for 4 mod 27 is 7.\n\nHence, $4 \\cdot 7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}$.\n\nStep 4: Multiply both sides of the original congruence by the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27, which is 7.\n\n$7 \\cdot 4x \\equiv 7 \\cdot 13 \\pmod{27}$\n\nSince $7 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}$, the equation simplifies to:\n\n$x \\equiv 7 \\cdot 13 \\pmod{27}$\n\n$x \\equiv 91 \\pmod{27}$\n\nSince $91 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{27}$ (because the closest multiple of 27 below 91 is 27*3 = 81), the solution is:\n\n$x \\equiv 10 \\pmod{27}$",
    "To solve the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27, which is an integer a such that $4a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}$. \n\nWe can find the multiplicative inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or by testing multiples of the base number in the modular equation. \n\nSince 4 and 27 are relatively small, we can test the multiples of 4 to find the inverse. First, we find 4x = 1 + 27k, where k is a non-negative integer.\n\nWe can start testing values for k:\n\n1. For k = 0, we get x = 0, but it's not a valid solution since we're looking for a multiplicative inverse.\n2. For k = 1, we get x = 7, because 4*7 - (1 + 27) = 28 - 28 = 0. However, this result is not 1, thus we will continue testing.\n3. For k = 2, we get x = 16, because 4*16 - (1 + 27 * 2) = 64 - 55 = 9, which is still not 1.\n4. For k = 3, 4 * 23 - (1 + 27 * 3) = 92 - 82 = 10. Still not 1.\n5. For k = 4, 4 * 29 - (1 + 27 * 4) = 116 - 113 = 3. Still not 1.\n6. For k = 5, 4 * 35 - (1 + 27 * 5) = 140 - 136 = 4. Still not 1.\n7. For k = 6, 4 * 41 - (1 + 27 * 6) = 164 - 163 = 1.\n\nNow that we have the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27 as 41 (which is 10 mod 27). We can multiply both sides of the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$ by 41:\n\n$4 * 41 * x \\equiv 41 * 13 \\pmod{27}$\n\nSimplifying the left-hand side, we get:\n\n$164x \\equiv 533 \\pmod{27}$\n\nSince 164x is equivalent to 10x modulo 27, and 533 is equivalent to 17 modulo 27, the equation simplifies to:\n\n$10x \\equiv 17 \\pmod{27}$\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides by the multiplicative inverse of 10 modulo 27, which we found to be 41 modulo 27.\n\nBeing aware that 41 mod 27 is 10 (41 = 1*27 + 14 and 14 = 5*3 + 1 therefore 10 mod 27 shifts 41 a remainder of 1 more than 27 so 14 %=10 mod 27 (improper wording simplifying)), \n\nThen,  $x \\equiv 41 * 17 \\equiv 10 * 17 \\equiv 170 \\pmod{27}$\n\n170 mod 27 simplifies to 7.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
