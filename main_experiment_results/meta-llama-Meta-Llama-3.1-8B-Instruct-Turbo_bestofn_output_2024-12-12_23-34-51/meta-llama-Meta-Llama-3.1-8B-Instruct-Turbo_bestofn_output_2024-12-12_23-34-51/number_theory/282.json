    "To find the remainder when the given expression is divided by 8, we will first find the remainder when each number is divided by 8, and then add those remainders. If the sum of these remainders is greater than 7, we will then find the remainder of the sum when divided by 8.\n\nFirst, let's find the remainder for each number when divided by 8: \n\n- $7145 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$ (The number 7145 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 8.)\n- $7146 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}$ (The number 7146 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 8.)\n- $7147 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$ (The number 7147 leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 8.)\n- $7148 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$ (The number 7148 leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8.)\n- $7149 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$ (The number 7149 leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 8.)\n\nNow, we will add the remainders we found: $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.$\n\nSince $15 > 7$, we need to find the remainder of 15 when divided by 8. The remainder when 15 is divided by 8 is $15 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}$ (The number 15 leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 8.)\n\nSo, the remainder when $7145 + 7146 + 7147 + 7148 + 7149$ is divided by 8 is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "To find the remainder when the given numbers are divided by 8, let's analyze each number individually:\n\n1. 7145 modulo 8: \n   Since the last three digits determine the remainder when a number is divided by 8, let's look at the last three digits of 7145 (145). Now, 145 modulo 8 can be calculated by checking the remainder of 145 divided by 8.\n\n   145 = 18*8 + 1\n\n   So, the remainder of 145 modulo 8 is 1.\n\n2. 7146 modulo 8:\n   \n   Now, let's consider the last three digits of 7146 (146).
