    "To find the base, we need to find a power of the base that is just above 555 (since the base must be to the power of 4 to get a 4-digit number).\n\nLet's look for the smallest power of 4 (since for decimal system, the smallest base to get 4 digit is base 10) and see if we can get the next base with the condition given.\n\nStart with base 6 because in base 5 it will only have three digits - 5 digits - 6 will have to find 6 digits - for base five we can at least get a number with four digits in base six.\n\n The next power to base six is $6^3=216$ which is smaller than 555, and $6^4=1296$, the largest number of digits to base six with 4 digits  - the smallest 6-digit number.\n\n6^4 > 555.  So that the base will have to be base 6.\n\nTherefore $\\boxed{6}$",

    "To find the base in which $555_{10}$ has 4 digits in the form ABAB, we need to find a base where $b^3 \\le 555 < b^4$, since we are looking for a 4-digit number.\n\nLet's try different bases starting from base 5:\n\n- For base 5, $5^3 = 125$, which is less than 555. \n- For base 6, $6^3 = 216$, which is less than 555.\n- For base 7, $7^3 = 343$, which is less than 555.\n- For base 8, $8^3 = 512$, which is less than 555.\n- For base 9, $9^3 = 729$, which is greater than 555.\n\nHowever, we should also consider bases between 9 and 6, but since $8^3<555<8^4$ we can make use of these as well. The only bases between 9 and 6 which also comply to $b^3<555<b^4$ is actually only bases 8.\n\nIn base 8, we have:\n- $555_{10} = 1363_8$\n\nThe digits A and B are indeed different (1 \u2260 3 and 3 \u2260 6).\n\nHowever, we need to also test 6 and 7 to see if the problem is correctly solved in base 8.\n\n- For base 7:\n  $555_{10} = 1353_7$\n\n\n\nFor base 6:\n$555_{10} = 2323_6$\n\nIn this case, the digits in base 7 aren't the same, but base 8 was actually the first case we solved and also base 6 even solves the task but isn't created from the smallest of the cases from 5 above as is the case with base 8 therefore one may not pick base 6 although technically the conditions were satisfied."

  "critique": "Solution 1 is incorrect because it doesn't provide a systematic approach to finding the base. It starts with base 6 without a clear reason for choosing this base.\n\nSolution 2 is the best solution. It correctly identifies the range of bases that satisfy the condition ($b^3 \\le 555 < b^4$) and systematically checks each base starting from 4. It finds that base 5 satisfies the condition and that $555_{10}$ has 4 digits in base 5 in the form ABAB.\n\nSolution 3 is incorrect because it doesn't correctly identify the range of bases that satisfy the condition. It also doesn't systematically check each base, but rather checks a few bases and then stops. It also incorrectly concludes that base 8 is the correct answer without considering other possible bases.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 2",
  "solution": "First, let us find which bases result in $555_{10}$ having four digits. We must find base b such that $b^{4}>555_{10}\\geq b^{3}$. We easily determine that b can range from 5 to 8, inclusive.  We can now try each of these four bases to see which yields a number in the form ABAB.  For base six, we find that $6^{3}=216$, which can go into 555 only two times at most, leaving $555-2\\cdot216 = 123$ for the next three digits. $6^{2}=36$ goes into 123 three times at most, leaving us with $123-3\\cdot36 = 15$. Then, $6^{1}=6$ goes into 15 two times at most, leaving $15-2\\cdot6 = 3$ for the ones digit. So, the base $\\boxed{6}$ equivalent of $555_{10}$ is $2323_{6}$, which satisfies all of the requirements stated.",
