    "To find the largest three-digit integer divisible by its distinct, non-zero digits, we should start by considering the hundreds digit, which should be the largest possible. \n\nGiven this, the hundreds digit must be 9. \n\nNext, we consider the tens digit. Since the number must be divisible by its digits, we have several options for the tens digit: 1, 3, 7, or 9 (as 2, 5, and 6 don't work because they can't be paired with a digit that the number is divisible by) but when we try to pair with the ones digit (1, 3, 7), there's no combination for 9 as the hundreds digit that satisfies all divisibility requirements for the conditions in the question (a non-zero, distinct numbers). \n\nNow, the tens digit can be 3 or 7. Let's start with the tens digit 3. We know that the hundreds digit must be 9. \n\nFor the ones digit, it must be a number that the number is divisible by. Possible options are 1, 3, and 9 (because 3 is a factor of 3*9*3 = 81: we get 3*9 = 27, 27*3 = 81; and 3 is a factor of 3: 9*3*1 = 27, 27/3 = 9), thus we can rule out 7 as the tens digit since we've no combination here for the ones digit. \n\nNow, let's find the largest possible number with the tens digit 3 and the hundreds digit 9. We've determined the ones place can be filled by 3. Thus, the largest three-digit integer divisible by its distinct, non-zero digits is 963/3 = 321.\n\nIf we try 7 as the tens digit, the ones digit can be 1, 3, or 7, but none of these numbers satisfy the divisibility requirement when considering other numbers (lets explore for 1 and 7 as the ones digit): if we try 1 as the ones digit the number becomes 971. We get: 9*71 = 639, 71/1 = 71 (Good, 639 and 71 is divisible by 9); for 7, we try it for the ones digit, the number becomes 797. We get: 79/7 = 11.279577 (not divisible by 7*79, here our choice of the ones digit number was 7. lets try it: 9*79 = 711; 79/7 = 11.285714) thus we have our suitable combination but this isn't the highest three-digit integer we're looking for. Now we have enough to determine that 797 isn't a possible solution. The correct choice is to take 1 for the ones digit for our suitable solution but as determined, the highest possible solution becomes: 9*71 = 639; 71/1 = 71 (we know our number works when we run this test) but when we get our largest numbers by using our preferred values we need to use the numbers (lets explore the highest possible three-digit integer to get our final answer that is divisible): if we try our values of 7 and 1 the largest possible three-digit integer is thus: 971.",
    "To solve this, we'll start by considering the hundreds digit, since it has the largest impact on the value of the number. We can eliminate numbers starting with 0, and numbers starting with 1 since they will not be the least among three distinct digits and will not be the maximum possible three-digit number.\n\nThe smallest possible hundreds digit for a maximum three-digit number would be 9, since we're looking for the largest three-digit integer. However, for the number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by 9. Starting with 9, we can try pairs of hundreds digits and units digits which also sum to a value divisible by 9.\n\nStarting with 9, a suitable units digit would be 0 since 9+0 is divisible by 9. However, we are required to have distinct, non-zero digits.\n\nThe next possible hundreds digit would be 8. If the tens digit (hundreds in a descending order is not possible since we also require non-zero) is also 9, then the sum would be 17 which is not divisible by 9. However, a tens digit of 0 doesn't satisfy the requirement as well because it is zero.\n\nConsidering 8 as the hundreds digit, if tens digit is 1, the sum is 10, which is not divisible by 9. \n\nThe tens digit must be 7 because 15 is divisible by 9. A possible number would then be a three digit number like 873.",
    "To find the largest three-digit integer divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we'll have to carefully consider the possible combinations.\n\nFirst, let's think about the hundreds digit. Since we're looking for the largest possible number, we'll start by considering the largest possible hundreds digit, which is 9. \n\nFor a number to be divisible by 9, its digits must sum to a multiple of 9. Given that our number is a multiple of 9 and has distinct digits, the sum of our digits must be divisible by 9.\n\nNext, let's consider the tens and ones digits. Since we're looking for the largest possible number, we want to maximize these digits as well. \n\nWe want to try a few cases starting with the hundreds digit being 9, and we want to keep the tens digit large as well. If we keep the tens digit 8, our ones digit must be a multiple of 4 and sum to 15. The only possibility for the ones digit is 7. However, 7 is not a multiple of 4, so this possibility is eliminated.\n\nIf we set the hundreds digit to 9 and try the tens digit as 7, we need our ones digit to be a multiple of 4, and sum to 16. The only possibility in this case is a number with a 7 as tens digit and a 9, 7 doesn't sum to a multiple of 9 with these numbers so we have to set the hundreds digit as a different number. \n\nHowever, this won't happen since 9 wont be hundreds digit and isn't the same if hundreds had been 9, and 8 as tens dig, the ones should be a multiple of 4 and add up to 17 which wont happen so we should not maximize the tens and ones digits as they are not multiples of 4 and won't lead to a multiple of 9 when the hundreds digit is 9.\n\nTherefore, we'll try to have the hundreds digit as 8. If we try this, the minimum possible value for the tens digit is 7, and we'll choose it as our tens digit to get a larger number. In this case, the ones digit must be a multiple of 7 and a multiple of 4, and it should sum to 18 with 7 and 8. The only multiple of both 4 and 7 is a number that is a multiple of 28. The largest multiple of 28 less than 20 is 12, so our ones digit must be 12. However, our number is 12 7 8, and this is not a valid solution as our number isn't divisible by all its digits since 8 isn't divisible by 2.\n\nLet's try to have the hundreds digit as 7 and a tens digit as 8, as we previously found that a number with a hundreds digit of 9 won't yield any solution. Our number should then sum to 15 with 7 and 8 as the tens and hundreds digits. We're now only trying the number with a 7 hundreds digit and a 9 tens digit with 8 as a multiple of 9 giving us a 936 solution since that number will be 9 + 3 + 6 = 18 a number that is divisible by 9 which is our solution.\n\nNow we should verify this solution. The number 936 can be divided by 936 / 9 = 104, 936 / 3 = 312, 936 / 6 = 156, 936 / 8 = 117, and 936 / 9 = 104, and we should see that 936 is indeed divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.\n\nTherefore, our final answer is $\\boxed{936}$."

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, we will analyze each solution for correctness.\n\nSolution 1: This solution is partially correct but has some errors. It correctly identifies the hundreds digit as 9, but then incorrectly concludes that the tens digit must be 3. It also has some incorrect calculations and conclusions. However, it does find a valid solution (963) but incorrectly states the final answer as 321.\n\nSolution 2: This solution is incorrect. It starts with the correct hundreds digit as 9, but then incorrectly concludes that the tens digit must be 0. It also does not consider the divisibility requirements for the other digits.\n\nSolution 3: This solution is correct. It correctly identifies the hundreds digit as 9 and then considers the divisibility requirements for the other digits. It also finds a valid solution (936) and verifies it correctly.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 3.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is 3.",
  "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",
