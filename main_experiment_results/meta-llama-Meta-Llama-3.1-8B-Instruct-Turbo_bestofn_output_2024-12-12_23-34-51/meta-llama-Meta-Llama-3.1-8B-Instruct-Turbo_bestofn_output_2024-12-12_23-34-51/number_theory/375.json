    "To find the number of even divisors of $7!$, we will first calculate the prime factorization of $7!$. \n\n$7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$\n\n$7! = (7^1 \\times 5^1) \\times (2^2 \\times 3^1) \\times 2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1$\n\nCombine all like powers and do exponent addition using the built in order of OMMD (Odd powers and then smallest) that we use when writing our exponential values of their prime factors\n\n$7! = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^1$\n\nNext, we need to find the number of even divisors. An even divisor is a divisor that has at least one factor of 2. Since we have $2^4$ in the prime factorization, any divisor that has $2^1$, $2^2$, $2^3$, or $2^4$ will be even. \n\nWe need to choose an exponent for 2, and for each exponent of 2 we choose, we have an unlimited number of choices for the exponents of the other prime factors. Let's consider all possible combinations:\n\n- The number of choices we have for the power of 2 is 4. This is because the power of 2 can be anything from 1 to 4.\n- The number of choices for the power of 3 is 3, since the power of 3 can be anything from 0 to 2.\n- The number of choices for the power of 5 is 3, since the power of 5 can be anything from 0 to 2.\n- The number of choices for the power of 7 is 2, since the power of 7 can be either 0 or 1.\n\nNow, we multiply these numbers together to find the total number of even divisors of $7!$. This will be: 4 (choices for the power of 2) x 3 (choices for the power of 3) x 3 (choices for the power of 5) x 2 (choices for the power of 7). 4 x 3 x 3 x 2 = 72.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{72}$.",

The prime factorization of $7!$ already contains four factors of 2, so we can use all of them for an even divisor.\n\nNow, let's focus on the powers of 2, 3, 5, and 7. We can write the exponent for each prime factor separately.\n\n- For the powers of 2: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (5 choices)\n- For the powers of 3: 0, 1, 2 (3 choices)\n- For the powers of 5: 0, 1 (2 choices)\n- For the powers of 7: 0, 1 (2 choices)\n\nSince we need at least one factor of 2, we exclude the choice 0 (which would result in an odd divisor). The total number of even divisors would be the product of the other choices: 5 choices for powers of 2 times 3 choices for powers of 3 times 2 choices for powers of 5 times 2 choices for powers of 7:\n\n$5 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = \\boxed{60}$",
    "To find the number of even divisors of $7!$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime factorize 7!**: \n    $7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 7 * 2 * 3 * 1 * 2 * 5 * 7 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 1$\n    $7! = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^1 * 7^2$\n\n2. **Understand the condition for a divisor to be even**: \n    A divisor is even if it contains at least one factor of 2. In other words, it must have a $2^x$ term in its prime factorization, where $x$ is at least 1.\n\n3. **Determine the range for the exponent of 2**: \n    The exponent of 2 ranges from 1 to 4, since it must be at least 1 to be even. This means there are 4 possible values for the exponent of 2.\n\n4. **Determine the ranges for the exponents of 3, 5, and 7**: \n    The exponents of 3, 5, and 7 can range from 0 up to the maximum number of occurrences in $7!$. In this case, the exponent of 3 can range from 0 to 2, the exponent of 5 can range from 0 to 1, and the exponent of 7 can range from 0 to 2.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of possibilities for each prime factor**: \n    * For 2: 4 possibilities\n    * For 3: 3 possibilities (0, 1, or 2)\n    * For 5: 2 possibilities (0 or 1)\n    * For 7: 3 possibilities (0, 1, or 2)\n\n6. **Multiply the number of possibilities for each prime factor together**: \n    This is based on the fundamental counting principle. Since each possible value for the exponent of one prime factor can be combined with any value for the exponent of the other prime factors, we multiply them together. \n    $4 * 3 * 2 * 3 = 4 * 9 = 36$\n\nSo, the number of even divisors of $7!$ is $\\boxed{36}$."

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I found the following:\n\nSolution 1: This solution is correct.

  "solution": "By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, we may count the number of even divisors of $7!$ by counting the number of ways to form the prime factorization of an even divisor of $7!$.  Suppose that $7!$ is divisible by an even positive integer $r$.  Since the prime factorization of $7!$ is $7\\cdot(2\\cdot3)\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\cdot2)\\cdot3\\cdot2=2^4\\cdot3^2\\cdot5\\cdot7$, the prime factorization of $r$ does not include any primes other than $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$.  Express $r$ in terms of its prime factorization as $2^a3^b5^c7^d$.  Then $7!/r=2^{4-a}3^{2-b}5^{1-c}7^{1-d}$.  Since $7!/r$ is an integer, $d$ must equal $0$ or $1$, $c$ must equal $0$ or $1$, and $b$ must equal $0$, $1$ or $2$.  Finally, $a$ may be no larger than $4$, but it must be at least $1$ since $r$ is even.  Altogether there are $2\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=48$ total possibilities for the four exponents $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, and hence $\\boxed{48}$ even divisors.",
