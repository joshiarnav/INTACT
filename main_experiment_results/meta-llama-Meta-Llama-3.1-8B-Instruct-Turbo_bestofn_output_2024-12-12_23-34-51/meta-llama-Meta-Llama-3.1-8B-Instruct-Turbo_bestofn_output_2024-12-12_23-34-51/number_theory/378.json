    "To find the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer, we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. Simplify the expression $\\frac{n+18}{n}$: \n$\\frac{n+18}{n} = \\frac{n}{n} + \\frac{18}{n}$ \n$= 1 + \\frac{18}{n}$ \n\nFor $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ to be an integer, $\\frac{18}{n}$ must also be an integer.\n\n2. Find the factors of $18$: \n$18 = 1 \\times 18 = 2 \\times 9 = 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\times 1$ \n\nThese are the possible values of $n$ since all of them will result in an integer value for $\\frac{18}{n}$.\n\n3. Calculate the sum of the factors:\nSum $= 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 18$ \n$= 39$\n\nSo the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer is $\\boxed{39}$.",

    "To find the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. The expression $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ can be rewritten as $\\frac{n}{n} + \\frac{18}{n}$ using the distributive property of fractions.\n\n2. Simplifying the expression, we get $1 + \\frac{18}{n}$.\n\n3. For $\\frac{18}{n}$ to be an integer, $n$ must be a divisor of $18$. \n\n4. The positive divisors of $18$ are $1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18$.\n\n5. Now, we need to find the sum of these divisors. \n\n6.
