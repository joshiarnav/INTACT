    "To find the sum of the tens digit and the units digit in the decimal representation of $9^{2004}$, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic, particularly with the base $100$, as we are dealing with the tens and units digits.\n\nStep 1: Find a pattern for the units digit of $9^n$.\n\nBy calculating the first few powers of $9$, we observe the following pattern for the units digit:\n\n- $9^1$: units digit is $9$\n- $9^2$: units digit is $1$\n- $9^3$: units digit is $9$\n- $9^4$: units digit is $1$\n- ...\n\nSo, we see that the units digit of $9^n$ is $9$ when $n$ is odd and $1$ when $n$ is even.\n\nStep 2: Determine whether 2004 is odd or even.\n\n$2004$ is an even number. \n\nStep 3: Find the pattern for the tens digit of $9^n$ using the base $100$ modulo $9^{4}$.\n\nWe are looking for the pattern of the last two digits of $9^n$, so let's express this using modular arithmetic with the base $100$. We can also notice that, $9^4$ leaves a units digit of $1$ when taken to any power.\n\nCalculating the powers of $9$, we get:\n\n- $9^{5} \\equiv 9^1\\pmod{10^2}$ (where we've used $a^{p-q} \\equiv (a^p)^q$ to get this result)\nSince, so $9^4$ is $1$, when raised to the power of any even number and, $9$ when any power with odd number.\nTherefore, any two-digit power in $9^n$ that has an even exponent will have the last two digits given by the remainder of $1 \\pmod{100}$. Any even power $n$ results in a number ending with $01$.",
    "To solve this problem, we first need to find the pattern in the last two digits of powers of 9.\n\nWe can start by calculating the first few powers of 9:\n\n- $9^1$ = 09 \n- $9^2$ = 81\n- $9^3$ = 729, but the last two digits are 29. However, 9^3 ends in 29, which then becomes 79 for 9^4 when you calculate 9^3 * 9 (i.e., 729 * 9 = 6561, ending in 61). Then the pattern we are looking for is related to 61 but more importantly, is 29, 79, since 9^2 = 81, then for 9^3, the last two digits turn into 29.\n- For 9^4, we already checked that the last two digits are 81.\n- However, now when taking 9^3 and multiplying it by 9 (from 9^4), we see 79 * 9 = 711, and when writing the number down, the 3 gets shifted into the tens place and no longer there, until when we write down the tens digit from the result, no longer being in the hundreds place, we get the number 611. In other words, the 1 in the tens place when you remove the last two numbers from 9^3 * 9 to obtain the number 711, from 3 * 100 (300), no longer exists due to reaching the 2-digit step of 10's multiples, so 3 * 10 = 30, so when you combine 62 + 10 - 1 from 611, you end up with the result 71 for 9^4.\n- For 9^5, we multiply 9^4 by 9. 71 * 9 = 639. Since we are looking for the last two digits, the result is 39.\n- For 9^6, we multiply 9^5 by 9. 39 * 9 = 351. The result for the last two digits is 51.\n- For 9^7, we multiply 9^6 by 9. 51 * 9 = 459. The result for the last two digits is 59.\n- For 9^8, we multiply 9^7 by 9. 59 * 9 = 531. The result for the last two digits is 31.\n- For 9^9, we multiply 9^8 by 9. 31 * 9 = 279. The result for the last two digits is 79.\n- For 9^10, we multiply 9^9 by 9. 79 * 9 = 711. The result for the last two digits is 11.\n- Since we see the pattern repeating (the last two digits repeat over a cycle of 10), we don't need to calculate all the powers of 9, but now we have a pattern to determine which of the powers of 9 have which last two digits. To determine the last two digits of $9^{2004}$, we can divide 2004 by 10 and take the remainder as the exponent's index of our pattern's final two digits.\n\n2004 / 10 = 200 remainder 4. Since 4 is the final two digits' index related to 9^4 when we repeat the pattern 9^3, 9^4 and so on, we then come to the conclusion that 9^2004 ends in 61.\n\nNow, we add the last two digits of the result:\n\n6 + 1 = 7\n\nSo, the sum of the tens digit and the units digit in the decimal representation of $9^{2004}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I found that they all reach the same correct answer, which is 7. However, Solution 2 and Solution 3 are more straightforward and easier to understand, while Solution 1 uses modular arithmetic and has a more complex explanation.\n\nBetween Solution 2 and Solution 3, both are clear and concise, but Solution 3 provides a more direct and explicit pattern recognition, which makes it easier to follow and understand.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 3. \n\nThe index number of the-selected solution is: 3.",
  "solution": "Write $9$ as $10-1$ and consider raising 9 to the 2004 power by multiplying out the expression \\[\n\\overbrace{(10-1)(10-1)(10-1)\\cdots(10-1)}^{2004\\text{ factors}}\n\\] There will be $2^{2004}$ terms in this expansion (one for each way to choose either 10 or $-1$ for each of the 2004 factors of $(10-1)$), but most of them will not affect the tens or units digit because they will have two or more factors of 10 and therefore will be divisible by 100.  Only the 2004 terms of $-10$ which come from choosing $-1$ in 2003 of the factors and 10 in the remaining one as well as the term $(-1)^{2004}=1$ remain.  Let $N$ represent the sum of all of the terms with more than 1 factor of 10.  We have \\begin{align*}\n(10-1)^{2004}&=N+2004(-10)+1\\\\\n&= N-20,\\!040+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-40+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-39.\n\\end{align*} So $9^{2004}$ is 39 less than a multiple of 100 and therefore ends in 61.  The sum of 6 and 1 is $\\boxed{7}$.",
