    "To convert $84_{10}$ to base $2$, we need to find the largest powers of $2$ that divide into $84$, and how many times they divide.\n\nStep 1: Find the largest power of 2 less than 84.\nThe largest power of 2 less than 84 is $2^6 = 64$. Since $64$ divides $84$ once, the remainder is $84 - 64 = 20$.\n\nStep 2: Find the largest power of 2 less than 20.\nThe largest power of 2 less than 20 is $2^4 = 16$. Since $16$ divides 20 once, the remainder is $20 - 16 = 4$.\n\nStep 3: Find the largest power of 2 less than 4.\nThe largest power of 2 less than 4 is $2^2 = 4$. This means that $4$ divides $4$ once with no remainder.\n\nNow that we have the largest powers of 2 that divide $84$, we can write down the binary representation.\n\n- $2^6$ (64) is included once, which corresponds to a 1 in the $2^6$ (64) position.\n- $2^4$ (16) is included once, which corresponds to a 1 in the $2^4$ (16) position.\n- $2^2$ (4) is included once, which corresponds to a 1 in the $2^2$ (4) position.\n- The remaining positions are 0 because no other powers of 2 are included.\n\nThe binary representation of $84_{10}$ is $1010100_2$. \n\nTherefore,\n\n$\\boxed{1010100_2}$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and yield the same result: $1010100_2$.\n\nHowever, Solution 1 and Solution 2 are more straightforward and easier to understand, as they involve repeated division by 2 and noting the remainders. This method is a common technique for converting decimal numbers to binary.\n\nSolution 3, while also correct, uses a slightly different approach involving finding the largest powers of 2 that divide the number. This method can be more time-consuming and may not be as intuitive for some people.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1 or Solution 2.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "We first find that the largest power of $2$ that is less than $84$ is $2^6 = 64$. Our next step is to find the largest power of $2$ that is less than $84 - 64 = 20$ which is $2^4=16$. This leaves us left with $20 - 16 = 4$, but $4 = 2 ^2$, so we have $$84 = 1 \\cdot 2^6 + 0 \\cdot 2^5 + 1 \\cdot 2^4 + 0 \\cdot 2^3 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 0 \\cdot 2^0.$$Thus, our base $2$ representation of $84_{10}$ is $\\boxed{1010100_2}$.",
