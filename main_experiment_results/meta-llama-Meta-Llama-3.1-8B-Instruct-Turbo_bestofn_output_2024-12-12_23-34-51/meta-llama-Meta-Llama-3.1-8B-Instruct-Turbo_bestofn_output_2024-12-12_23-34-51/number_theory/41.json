    "To find the smallest possible value for the least common multiple (LCM) of $k$ and $\\ell,$ we can start by considering the given information that $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3.$ This implies that both $k$ and $\\ell$ are multiples of $3,$ but they are not multiples of any higher power of $3.$ In other words, $k=3a$ and $\\ell=3b,$ where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers.\n\nNow, we can use the formula that relates the product of two numbers, their greatest common divisor, and their least common multiple: $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] \\cdot \\gcd(k,\\ell) = k\\ell.$ Plugging in our expressions for $k$ and $\\ell,$ we get $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] \\cdot 3 = (3a)(3b) = 9ab.$ Since $3$ is a common factor on both sides, we can divide both sides by $3$ to obtain $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = 3ab.$\n\nOur goal is to minimize the value of $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell],$ so we want to choose $a$ and $b$ such that their product $ab$ is as small as possible. However, $a$ and $b$ must be relatively prime, so they cannot have any common factors. The smallest possible values for $a$ and $b$ are $a = 11$ and $b = 23.$ These values are relatively prime and result in a product of $ab = 253.$ Therefore, the smallest possible value for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$ is $3ab = 3 \\cdot 253 = 759.$\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{759}.$",
    "To find the smallest possible value for the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive 4-digit integers $k$ and $\\ell$, where $\\gcd(k, \\ell) = 3$, we should start by understanding what it means for the greatest common divisor (GCD) to be 3.\n\nSince $\\gcd(k, \\ell) = 3$, it means that the only factors of $k$ and $\\ell$ in common are 1 and 3. This also implies that neither $k$ nor $\\ell$ is a multiple of any other number greater than 3, i.e., they are both prime to other numbers except for 3 and 1.\n\nTo minimize the LCM of $k$ and $\\ell$, we need to minimize the value of $\\frac{k\\ell}{3}$, as $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = \\frac{k\\ell}{\\gcd(k,\\ell)}$.

LCM equals k * l / 3. Thus, LCM = (3006 * 3009) / 3 = 3,018,900 / 3 = 1,006,300.\n\nHence, the answer is \n$\\boxed{1006300}$.",
    "To find the smallest possible value for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$, we first need to understand the relationship between $\\gcd(k,\\ell)$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$. \n\nThe product of two numbers is equal to the product of their greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM).

However, 1002 is not the smallest 4-digit multiple that will give us the answer because if one of the 4 digit numbers is 1002, the other has to be 1003 to get the GCD of 1 (the two have a difference of 1) since  1002 is not divisible by 3 otherwise the GCD would be a multiple of 3.\n\nWe should test for 1002+3 = 1005.\n\nTo do this, set $\\ell = 1005$ and $k = 1002$.
