    "We are given two congruences: \n\n$$4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$$\nand \n$$3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}.$$\n\nLet's solve them step by step.\n\n1. We can simplify the first congruence by dividing both sides by 4: \n\n$$x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}.$$\n\n2. Now we will solve the second congruence: \n$$3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}.$$\n\nTo solve it, we need to multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 3 modulo 20. The modular inverse of 3 modulo 20 is 7 because $3\\cdot 7 = 21$, and $21\\equiv 1\\pmod{20}$.\n\nSo, we multiply both sides of the second congruence by 7: \n\n$$x\\equiv 7\\cdot 16\\pmod{20}$$\n\n$$x\\equiv 112\\pmod{20}$$\n\n$$x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}.$$\n\nNow we have two congruences for x: \n\n$$x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$$\nand \n$$x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}.$$\n\nSince $\\gcd(5,20) = 5$, we can combine the two congruences using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). \n\nWe know that $\\pmod{\\text{lcm}(5,20)} = \\pmod{20}$.\n\nUsing the CRT, we get:\n\n$$x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}.$$\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by 20:\n\n$$x^2 \\equiv 12^2 \\pmod{20}$$\n\n$$x^2 \\equiv 144 \\pmod{20}$$\n\n$$x^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{20}.$$\n\nThe remainder when $x^2$ is divided by 20 is $\\boxed{4}$.",
