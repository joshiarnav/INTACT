    "To convert $\\frac{3}{1250}$ into a decimal and determine the number of zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit, we can start by simplifying the fraction.\n\nThe denominator, 1250, can be expressed as 2 * 5^4. However, since we are looking for zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit, we can simplify the fraction by dividing by 5s.\n\nSince 1250 is divisible by 5^4, let's simplify the fraction:\n\n$\\frac{3}{1250} = \\frac{3}{5^4 * 2}$\n\nDividing both the numerator and denominator by 3 will lead to:\n\n$\\frac{3}{5^4 * 2} = \\frac{1}{5^4 * \\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{1}{625 * \\frac{2}{3}}$\n\nTo have a denominator of 625 for easier conversion to a decimal, let's multiply both the numerator and denominator by $\\frac{3}{2}$ to get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{625 * \\frac{2}{3}} * \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{1250}$\n\nThen \n\n$\\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{1250} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{2 * 5^4}$ \n\nThis equals $\\frac{3}{2} *  \\frac{1}{2 * 5^4}$ which can be re-written as: $\\frac{3}{2^{2}} *  \\frac{1}{5^{4}}$ \n\nConverting to decimals this is $0.0018$ \n\nCounting the zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit (1), we have two zeros. \n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "To convert $\\frac{3}{1250}$ to a decimal and determine the number of zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit, we need to simplify the fraction. \n\nFirst, let's find the inverse of the denominator by expressing 1250 as $3.125 \\times 10^3$, then finding a factor of 3.125.

    "To write the fraction as a decimal, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator.\n\n$\\frac{3}{1250}$ can be rewritten as $\\frac{3}{2^1 \\cdot 5^4}$.\n\nWe can multiply the numerator and denominator by $2^3$ to get:\n\n$\\frac{3}{2^1 \\cdot 5^4} \\cdot \\frac{2^3}{2^3} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 2^3}{2^4 \\cdot 5^4} = \\frac{24}{2^4 \\cdot 5^4}$\n\nNow we can rewrite the fraction with the prime factorization of the denominator:\n\n$\\frac{24}{(2^2)^2 \\cdot (5^2)^2}$\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n$\\frac{24}{2^2 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 5^2}$\n\nTo get the decimal form, we need to divide 24 by the denominator:\n\n$\\frac{24}{2^2 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 5^2}$ = $\\frac{24}{400}$\n\nNow we divide 24 by 400:\n\n24 \u00f7 400 = 0.06\n\nThere are two zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit. \nSo the answer is $\\boxed{2}$."

  "solution": "Rather than doing long division, we will write the given fraction to have a denominator of the form $10^b=2^b \\cdot 5^b$, where $b$ is a positive integer. First, we write $\\dfrac{3}{1250}$ as $\\dfrac{3}{2^1 \\cdot 5^4}$. To make the denominator fit the form $2^b \\cdot 5^b$, we make $b$ the larger of the two exponents, which in this case is $4$. Thus, we have $$\\frac{3}{5^4 \\cdot 2^1} \\cdot \\frac{2^3}{2^3}=\\frac{3 \\cdot 2^3}{5^4 \\cdot 2^4} = \\frac{24}{10^4}$$The exponent in the denominator is $4$, and $24$ are the last two digits. Therefore, there are $4-2=\\boxed{2}$ zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit.",
