    "To solve this problem, we will break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding remainders**: When Marcus divides $a$ by 45, he gets a remainder of 37. This means that $a = 45k + 37$ for some integer $k$. Similarly, when he divides $b$ by 30, he gets a remainder of 9, so $b = 30m + 9$ for some integer $m$.\n\n2. **Representing a and b with remainders**:\n   - $a = 45k + 37$\n   - $b = 30m + 9$\n\n3. **Adding a and b**\n   - Adding $a$ and $b$, we get: \n   - $(a + b) = (45k + 37) + (30m + 9)$\n\n4. **Simplifying (a + b)**:\n   - $(a + b) = 45k + 30m + 46$ \n   - $(a + b) = 15(3k + 2m) + 46$ \n\n5. **Determining the remainder when dividing by 15**:\n   - We can see that $(a + b)$ is 15 times an integer (15 times $(3k + 2m)$) plus 46. We need to find the remainder when dividing by 15.\n   - Since 46 can be written as 45 + 1, it is 15 times 3 plus 1.\n   - Thus the remainder when dividing $(a + b)$ by 15 is 1.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when Marcus divides $a + b$ by 15 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "To find the remainder when Marcus divides $a+b$ by 15, we need to first express $a$ and $b$ in terms of their quotients and remainders.\n\nGiven that $a$ divided by 45 leaves a remainder of 37, we can express $a$ as:\n\\[ a = 45q + 37, \\] \nwhere $q$ is the quotient.\n\nGiven that $b$ divided by 30 leaves a remainder of 9, we can express $b$ as:\n\\[ b = 30r + 9, \\] \nwhere $r$ is the quotient.\n\nNow, let's add $a$ and $b$:\n\\[ a + b = (45q + 37) + (30r + 9) \\]\n\\[ a + b = 45q + 30r + 46 \\]\n\nNow, we want to express $a+b$ in terms of multiples of 15 and a remainder. Notice that $45q$ is always a multiple of 15, and $30r$ is also a multiple of 15. So, let's factor out 15 from $45q$ and $30r$:\n\\[ a + b = (3\\cdot15q) + (2\\cdot15r) + 46 \\]\n\nNotice that we can rewrite 46 as:\n\\[ 46 = 15(3) + 1 \\] \nSo, \n\\[ a + b = (3\\cdot15q) + (2\\cdot15r) + 15(3) + 1 \\]\n\nWe can now combine the multiples of 15:\n\\[ a + b = (3\\cdot15q + 2\\cdot15r + 15(3)) + 1 \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[ a + b = 15(3q + 2r + 3) + 1 \\]\n\nSo, $a+b$ can be expressed as $15k + 1$ where $k$ is a quotient ( $3q + 2r + 3$).\n\nTherefore, the remainder when Marcus divides $a+b$ by 15 is $\\boxed{1}$",
    "To find the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15, we first need to understand the pattern of remainders for $a$ and $b$ when divided by 15.\n\n1. For $a$, when it is divided by 45, the remainder is 37. We can represent this as:\n\\[ a = 45q + 37 \\]\nwhere $q$ is the quotient. When 45 is divided by 15, the remainder is 0 (since 45 is a multiple of 15). So, \n\\[ a = 15(3q) + 37 \\]\nSince $3q$ is an integer, we can simplify this expression as:\n\\[ a \\equiv 37 \\pmod{15} \\]\n\n2. For $b$, when it is divided by 30, the remainder is 9. We can represent this as:\n\\[ b = 30r + 9 \\]\nwhere $r$ is the quotient. When 30 is divided by 15, the remainder is 0. So, \n\\[ b = 15(2r) + 9 \\]\nAgain, since $2r$ is an integer, we can simplify this expression as:\n\\[ b \\equiv 9 \\pmod{15} \\]\n\nNow, to find the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15, we can add the congruences for $a$ and $b$:\n\\[ a+b \\equiv 37+9 \\pmod{15} \\]\n\\[ a+b \\equiv 46 \\pmod{15} \\]\n\nWe can simplify 46 modulo 15:\n\\[ 46 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{15} \\]\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15 is $\\boxed{1}$."
