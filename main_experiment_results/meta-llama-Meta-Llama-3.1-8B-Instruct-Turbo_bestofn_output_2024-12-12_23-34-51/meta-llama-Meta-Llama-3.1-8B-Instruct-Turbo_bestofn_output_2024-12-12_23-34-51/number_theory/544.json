    "To find the possible quantities of cupcakes Claire could have, we need to consider the two conditions:\n\n1. When the cupcakes are divided into groups of 5, there are 3 remaining.\n2. When the cupcakes are divided into groups of 7, there are 4 remaining.\n\nLet's denote the total number of cupcakes as n.\n\nFrom the first condition, we can write the equation:\nn = 5q + 3, where q is the quotient (the number of groups of 5 cupcakes).\n\nFrom the second condition, we can write the equation:\nn = 7p + 4, where p is the quotient (the number of groups of 7 cupcakes).\n\nWe are looking for values of n that satisfy both conditions. One way to approach this is to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), but in this case, we can also try to find a pattern by listing the possible values of n.\n\nSince n = 5q + 3, the possible values of n are: 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38, 43, 48, 53, 58, 63, ...\n\nSince n = 7p + 4, the possible values of n are: 4, 11, 18, 25, 32, 39, 46, 53, 60, ...\n\nWe can see that both lists overlap at n = 18 and n = 53. Since Claire has fewer than 60 cupcakes, the only possible quantities of cupcakes she could have are 4 is too small, but 18 and 53 are valid. \n\nSo, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that Claire could have is 18 + 53 = 71.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n$\\boxed{71}$",

  "solution": "If Claire has $N$ cupcakes, we know that $N = 5x+3$ and $N = 7y+4$ for some integers $x$ and $y$. Equating these two forms of $N$, we have $7y+1=5x$. We also know that $N<60$. We can write out all the sufficiently small possible values of $7y+1$: $$1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57.$$Of these, the numbers that are also of the form $5x$ are $15$ and $50$. These correspond to solutions $N=18,$ $N=53$. Thus, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes is $53+18 = \\boxed{71}$.",
