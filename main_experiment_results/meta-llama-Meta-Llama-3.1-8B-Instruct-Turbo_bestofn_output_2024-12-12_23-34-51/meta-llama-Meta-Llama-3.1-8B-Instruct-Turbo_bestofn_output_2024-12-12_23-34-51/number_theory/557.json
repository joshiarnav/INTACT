    "To find the units digit of $5^4$, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. $5^1 = 5$. The units digit is 5.\n2. $5^2 = 25$. The units digit is 5.\n3. $5^3 = 125$. The units digit is 5.\n4. $5^4 = 625$. The units digit is 5.\n\nFrom this pattern, we can see that no matter what power of 5 we are dealing with, the units digit will always be 5. Therefore, the units digit of $5^4$ is still 5.\n\nSo, the answer is: $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "To find the units digit of $5^4$, let's first break it down into smaller steps.\n\nStep 1: Find the units digit of $5^1$, which is 5.\n\nStep 2: Multiply this by $5^1$ to get $5^2$. The units digit of $5^2$ is 25, which has a units digit of 5.\n\nStep 3: Multiply this by $5^1$ to get $5^3$.

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct, but Solution 1 is the most concise and efficient. It directly identifies the pattern and applies it to the problem, making it the best solution. \n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1.",
  "solution": "The units digit of any positive integer power of 5 is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\n(Note: this claim may be proved by induction, since the units digit of $5n$ is 5 whenever the units digit of $n$ is 5.)",
