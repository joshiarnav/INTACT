    "Let's call the three integers $a,$ $b,$ and $c.$ We are given that $a$ divided by $24$ leaves a remainder of $10,$ so $a = 24n + 10$ for some integer $n.$ Similarly, $b = 24m + 4$ and $c = 24p + 12,$ where $m$ and $p$ are integers.\n\nNow, let's add the three integers together: \n$a + b + c = (24n + 10) + (24m + 4) + (24p + 12) = 24n + 24m + 24p + 26.$\n\nFactoring out the $24$ from the first three terms, we have \n$a + b + c = 24(n + m + p) + 26.$\n\nWe want to find the remainder when $a + b + c$ is divided by $24$. Notice that $24(n + m + p)$ is a multiple of $24$, so when we divide $24(n + m + p) + 26$ by $24,$ the remainder will just be the remainder of $26$ divided by $24$. \n\nSince $26$ divided by $24$ leaves a remainder of $2,$ the remainder of $26$ divided by $24$ is $2$. Therefore, the remainder of $a + b + c$ divided by $24$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I found that all three solutions are correct and arrive at the same answer, which is a remainder of 2 when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24.\n\nHowever, I would recommend Solution 1 as the best solution.
