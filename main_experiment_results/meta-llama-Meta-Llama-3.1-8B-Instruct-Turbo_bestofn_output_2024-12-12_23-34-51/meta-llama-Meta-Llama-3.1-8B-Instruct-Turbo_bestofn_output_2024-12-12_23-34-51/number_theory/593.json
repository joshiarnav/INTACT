    "To express the product of $1001_2$ and $121_3$ in base 10, we first need to convert both numbers to base 10.\n\n**Converting $1001_2$ to base 10:**\n\nThe given number $1001_2$ is in base 2. To convert it to base 10, we need to multiply each digit by 2 raised to the power of its position from right to left, starting with 0.\n\n$1001_2$ =  $1 \\times 2^3 + 0 \\times 2^2 + 0 \\times 2^1 + 1 \\times 2^0$\n= $8 + 0 + 0 + 1$\n= $9$\n\nSo, $1001_2$ in base 10 is $9$.\n\n**Converting $121_3$ to base 10:**\n\nThe given number $121_3$ is in base 3.

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They all arrive at the same answer, which is 144. However, I will analyze each solution for clarity, completeness, and conciseness.\n\nSolution 1 is clear and concise, but it could benefit from a brief explanation of the conversion process.\n\nSolution 2 is similar to Solution 1, but it lacks a brief explanation of the conversion process.\n\nSolution 3 is the most detailed and clear solution. It provides a step-by-step explanation of the conversion process and the multiplication.\n\nConsidering the clarity, completeness, and conciseness of each solution, I would select Solution 3 as the best solution.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 3",
  "solution": "In order to find the product of the two, we first convert both values into base 10. We have that $1001_2=1(2^3)+0(2^2)+0(2^1)+1(2^0)=8+1=9$, and that $121_3=1(3^2)+2(3^1)+1(3^0)=9+6+1=16$. The product of the two is just $(9)(16)=\\boxed{144}$.",
