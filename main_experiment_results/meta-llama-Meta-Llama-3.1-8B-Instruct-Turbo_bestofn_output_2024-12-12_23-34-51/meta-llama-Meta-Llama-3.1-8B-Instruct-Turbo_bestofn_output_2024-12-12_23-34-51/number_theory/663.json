    "Given the equations:\n\n1. ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$\n2. ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$\n\nWe will interpret the numbers in base-6 and follow the given conditions.\n\nFrom equation 1, we can see that when a one-digit number $C$ is added to a two-digit number $AB$ in base-6, it results in a two-digit number $C0$. This implies that the units digit of $AB_6$ is 5, because in base-6, the only digit that, when added with another digit (from 0 to 5), will result in a carry, is 5. Therefore, $B=5$.\n\nNow, from equation 2, when ${AB_6}$ is added to ${BA_6}$ (which can be written as ${56B_6}$), it results in ${CC_6}$. Given that $B=5$, we have:\n\n${56A_6}+{AS_6}={5C_6}$\n\nSince we already know that $B=5$, let's try to determine $A$ and $C$.\n\nIn base-6, when ${56A_6}$ is added to ${AS_6}$, it results in a base-6 number that must end with the digit 5. This only happens if both $A$ and $C$ are even digits, because then the carry will be 1 and end with a 5, regardless of the digit in the tens place.\n\nAlso, note that the largest possible value of a two-digit base-6 number is $55_6$, which is $5 \\cdot 6 + 5 = 35$ in decimal. Now, we have:\n\n1. ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$\n2. ${56A_6}+{AS_6}={5C_6}$\n\nWith $B=5$, we are left with $A$ and $C$.\n\nNow, from equation 1, when a one-digit number $C$ is added to a two-digit number ${AB_6}$, it results in ${C0_6}$. This implies that the units digit of $AB_6$ is 5. We have already determined that $B=5$. \n\nNow, let's find $A$ and $C$. In this case, we should try $A = 4$, then we will find $C = 4$. Now that we know what $A$ and $B$ are, we can find the value of $C$.\n\nLet's substitute the values for $A=4$ and $B=5$ into equation 2:\n\n${45_6}+{54_6}={44_6}$\n\nAnd you can see that the result holds.\n\nThus, we can find the answer in base-10: $A = 4$, $B = 5$, and $C = 4$, resulting in the three-digit number ${4, 5, 4} = \\boxed{545}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given equations:\n\n1. ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$\n2. ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$\n\nFrom equation 1, when we add a one-digit number $C_6$ to a two-digit number $AB_6$ in base 6, the sum is a two-digit number $C0_6$. This implies that the addition of $B_6$ and $C_6$ does not result in a carry.\n\nLet's denote the values of $A$ and $B$ as integers (not base 6) for easier calculation.\n\nSince $B_6 + C_6$ does not result in a carry, the sum of $B$ and $C$ should not be greater than 5 because we are in base 6.\n\nNow, looking at equation 2, when we add two two-digit numbers $AB_6$ and $BA_6$, the sum is a two-digit number $CC_6$. This implies that there is a carry from the sum of $A_6 + B_6$.\n\nHowever, since we are in base 6 and do not want any carry when adding $B_6$ and $C_6$, the sum of $A_6 + B_6$ must be $> 5$ to produce a carry.\n\nFrom the information above, we have two possibilities for the values of A and B:\n\n1. $A + B = 6$ (no carry in this addition)\n2. $A + B = 10$ (in this case, base 6)\n\nSince A and B are in base 6, we will use $A + B = 6$ as our base for calculations instead as $A + B = 10_{6}$ is like $A + B = 4_{10}$\n\nFrom the equation 1, we can conclude the following:\n$B + C = 6$\n\nFrom equation 2, we can conclude the following:\n$A + B + C$ must result in a carry.\n\nHowever, we know that $C$ must be less than $6$, and $A + B = 6$. Given this information, if we add $C$ to $A + B$, a carry cannot be produced (in base 6).\n\nTo find the values of A, B, and C, we need to check possible values for A and B and then determine C.\n\nSince A and B must be in base 6 and A < B < 6, our possible pairs are $(A,B) = (1,5), (2,4),$ or $(3,3)$. However, since A, B, and C are distinct, the last pair cannot be used. Therefore, our possible pairs are reduced to $(A,B) = (1,5), (2,4)$.\n\nIn both cases, we'll have two possible choices for C.\n\n1. If $(A,B) = (1,5)$, then $B + C = 5 + C = 6$, so $C = 1$ is not possible and therefore $C=5$ cannot be used since we declared that we had two options for C in this case and the other would work since C should be $> 1$ to cancel the carry and we obtained the carry in the evaluation of equation 2.\n\n2. If $(A,B) = (2,4)$, then $B + C = 4 + C = 6$, so $C = 2$ is not possible since we declared that we had two options for C in this case. When we use $A + B$ to evaluate our second equation, we obtain the result of 3 + A in base 6. When we add A to this number like we do in equation 2, we will indeed get the carry. In this case, the value of C that satisfies this requirement is $C = 4$. Since we want $> 2$, this is a valid choice for C.\n\nTo determine $C$ we need to check whether in the evaluation of equation 2, we really have a carry and to see whether the value we obtain in equation 1 will work for our possible choice of values of $A$ and $B$. We can see that in the choice $A = 2, B = 4, C = 4$ the equations really work and a carry does indeed occur.\n\nTherefore, the values of A, B, and C are $2, 4,$ and $4$, respectively.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{244}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.\n\nFrom the first equation, ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$, let's consider the different possible values for $A$, $B$, and $C$. The value $C$ must be $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, or $5$. If $C=5$, the sum in base-6 must have a carry, which is impossible because we're adding a single digit to a 2-digit number in base-6. \n\nSo we take $C=1$, and rewrite the equation as $6A+B+1=6$. This simplifies to $6A+B=5$. If we let $B=5$, we would have $A=0$, but $A$ must be nonzero.\n\nSo, $B\\leq 4$. We consider these cases:\n\nCase 1: $B=4$.\n\n$6A+4=5$\n\n$6A=1$\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nCase 2: $B=3$.\n\n$6A+3=5$\n\n$6A=2$\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nCase 3: $B=2$.\n\n$6A+2=5$\n\n$6A=3$\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nCase 4: $B=1$.\n\n$6A+1=5$\n\n$6A=4$\n\n$A=\\frac{2}{3}$\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nCase 5: $B=0$.\n\nWe cannot have $B=0$ because the number ${AB_6}$ is a 2-digit number in base-6 and B can't be zero, as per problem statement.\n\nHowever, we've exhausted all possibilities of $C=1$, and none of them worked. Our initial assumption that $C=1$ might be incorrect.\n\nNow, we try the next:\n\nGiven that C is $2$, we rewrite the equation ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$ as: $6A+B+2=12$. We have to convert the 12 to base-6 which would become $20_6$ (as $2*6^1 + 0*6^0$ and using 2 for the first digit). This simplifies to $6A+B=10$ in base-6 (but using 10 as the number 10 not ten), which can be rewritten as $6A+B=4\\cdot 6 + 2$ (It is actually just saying that it equals base 6's 20). But in base-6, we can represent $10_6$ as $4\\cdot 6 + 2$, therefore it means our simplified expression is $6A+B=4\\cdot 6 + 2$ or $(6 \\text{ x 4})\\text{ + B  = 20}$ or just saying that our number can be defined by $A+B=2$.\n\nNow, we rewrite the second equation as $6A+B+6B+A=6C+6$ or $7A +6B =6C+6$.\n\n\nHowever, this information has some overlap from the equation we got from the first one.\n\nWe found the value of $A+B$ earlier. To make things easier let us just assign $A+B=2$ and now  we take values of A and B to find which of them would be equal to 6C + 6 (if we take a 2 digit number which is the smallest number that we found to satisfy A+B=2) and using values for $A$ and $B$ which are $C$, 1, we can make an equation out of it.\n\n$$7C+6*1 = 6C + 6$$\n\nwhich simplifies to\n\n$$C + 6 = 6C + 6$$ \n\nor \n\n$$0 = 5C$$\n\nThis equation becomes impossible when $C$ is any number other than $0$.\n\nHowever, it is given in the problem that C is a non-zero number, so $C$ will be $\\frac{0}{5}$ which is $0$, since we have taken C as unlike we took previously $A+B = 2$, here we assumed $C + 6 = 6C + 6$ so  we obviously can't find any value for non-zero C and using values $A=0, B=2$. By  trying all of our number we can try $A=0, B=2$  and solve $C + 6 = 6C + 6$ to see that we can obviously not get any value for $C$ and using values for $C$ which are $C= 1, 2,3 ,4,5$  but we tried values of $C$ and for values of $C$ like $C=5,4,$ etc none of them will work, we found that obviously using values which make us to solve $A+B = 2$ will solve our problem for non-zero $C$ for a particular value of $C$.\n\nWe can have a look at an alternative solution with  a different approach.\n\nWe can go back to out 1 equation $C+6A+B=10$. B can not  be equal to $5$ and for $B$ can't be equal to $5$.\n\nFor $B=4$, $6A+B=10$, $6A+4=10$ , which results to\n\n$6A=6$, or\n\n$A=1$.\n\nWith this $A$ and $B$, we get a number $A14$.\n\nWe can check this result by substituting into the second equation.\n\n$A14+B14=A14+C14$\n\nSubstituting in $A=1$, $B=4$, and $C=1$, we get:\n\n$\\underline{1114_6} + \\underline{4414_6} = \\underline{1515_6}$\n\nFrom this, we can see that our $A, B,$ and $C$ are correct.\n\nSo, we can say for $A=1$, $B=4$ and $C=1$\n\nOur number is $141$"
