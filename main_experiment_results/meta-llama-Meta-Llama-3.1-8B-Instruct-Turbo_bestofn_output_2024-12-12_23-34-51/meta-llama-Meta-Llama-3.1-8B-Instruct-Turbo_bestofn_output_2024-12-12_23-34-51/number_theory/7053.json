    "To start, let's break down the problem. \n\n1. We are dealing with a solid rectangular block formed by gluing $N$ congruent 1-cm cubes face to face.\n2. When viewed so that three of its faces are visible, exactly $231$ of the 1-cm cubes cannot be seen.\n3. This means that the $231$ non-visible cubes must lie below exactly one layer of cubes. \n\nLet's consider the structure of the block when it's viewed from the side. The non-visible cubes must form a rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension compared to the original block.\n\nLet the original block's dimensions be $l \\times m \\times n$. Then, the dimensions of the non-visible block are $(l - 1)\\times(m-1)\\times(n-1)$, and we know that\n\n$(l - 1)\\times(m-1)\\times(n-1) = 231$\n\nNow we need to find the factorization of $231$. It can be factored into primes as follows:\n\n$231 = 3 \\times 7 \\times 11$\n\nConsidering the prime factorization of $231$, let's consider the possible factor combinations of $231$ to get the dimensions of the non-visible block. \n\nCombining the three prime factors, we can get three factor combinations:\n\n- $(1, 3, 77)$ \n- $(1, 7, 33)$ \n- $(1, 11, 21)$\n\nThe non-visible block's dimensions can be $1\\times3\\times77$, $1\\times7\\times33$, or $1\\times11\\times21$.\n\nSince the original block is one unit taller in each dimension, the possible dimensions for the original block are:\n\n- $2\\times4\\times78$ \n- $2\\times8\\times34$ \n- $2\\times12\\times22$\n\nNow, let's find the smallest number of cubes for each of these cases. \n\nFor the dimensions $2\\times4\\times78$, the smallest possible value of $N$ is $2\\times4\\times78 = 1248$. \n\nFor the dimensions $2\\times8\\times34$, the smallest possible value of $N$ is $2\\times8\\times34 = 544$. \n\nFor the dimensions $2\\times12\\times22$, the smallest possible value of $N$ is $2\\times12\\times22 = 528$. \n\nNow, let's compare the three results and choose the smallest possible value of $N$.\n\nComparing the results of $1248$, $544$, and $528$, we can see that the smallest possible value of $N$ is $\\boxed{528}$",
    "To start solving the problem, let's break it down into the following steps:\n\n1.  **Visualizing the Problem:** Visualize the rectangular block as a box with three visible faces. The block consists of $N$ congruent 1-cm cubes, and when viewed from the three faces, exactly $231$ of the 1-cm cubes cannot be seen.\n\n2.  **Understanding the Unseen Cubes:** The $231$ unseen cubes must lie below exactly one layer of cubes, as this is the only scenario in which they are not visible when the block is viewed from three faces.\n\n3.  **Creating a Layered Structure:** If the bottom layer of cubes has dimensions $x \\times y$ (in cm), the remaining $231$ cubes must occupy a rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension, resulting in dimensions of $(x - 1)\\times (y - 1)$.\n\n4.  **Counting the Number of Unseen Cubes:**\n    The number of unseen cubes can be expressed as the product of the dimensions of the rectangular solid with one unit removed from each dimension. This results in the following expression:\n    $(x - 1)\\times (y - 1)\\times 1 = 231$\n\n5.  **Finding the Prime Factorization of $231$:**\n    Prime factorizing $231$, we get $231 = 3\\times 7\\times 11$. \n\n6.  **Finding the Smallest Possible Dimensions:**\n    Now, we can try to match the prime factors with possible combinations of $(x - 1)$, $(y - 1)$, and $1$. The smallest possible dimensions will result in the smallest $x$ and $y$, which in turn will give us the smallest possible value of $N$.\n\n7.  **Dimension Combinations:**\n    Since we need the product of three positive integers with a product of $231$, we can use the prime factorization to construct possible combinations.\n\n    Combination 1: $(x - 1) = 231$ and $(y - 1) = 1$ does not work since it results in $(x, y)$ being very large.\n    Combination 2: $(x - 1) = 3$ and $(y - 1) = 77$ (or vice versa) does not work since it results in $(x, y)$ being too large as well.\n    Combination 3: $(x - 1) = 7$ and $(y - 1) = 33$ (or vice versa) also does not work for the same reason.\n    Combination 4: $(x - 1) = 11$ and $(y - 1) = 21$ (or vice versa) does not work for the same reason either.\n\n    Combination 5: $(x - 1) = 3 \\times 7$ and $(y - 1) = 11$ or vice versa. This combination gives us $(x, y)$. As before, we get:\n    $(x, y) = (10, 12)$\n\n    However, to check this combination we have to use the smallest combination in which the product is $231$ and then get the value of $(x, y)$. So we will consider these values.\n\n8.  **Smallest Value of $N$:**\n    The total number of cubes $N$ is the product of the dimensions, so the smallest possible value of $N$ can be found using the following expression:\n    $N = (x)(y)$ \n    Using the values for $(x, y) = (10, 12)$, we can find the smallest possible value of $N$.\n\n9.  **Calculating the Smallest Possible Value of $N$:**\n    $N = (10)(12) = 120$",
    "To solve this problem, let's consider the configuration of the cubes and the block. We are looking for the smallest possible value of $N$.\n\nThe $231$ cubes that cannot be seen must lie below exactly one layer of cubes. This layer has $l \\times w$ cubes, and the block has a total of $l \\times w \\times h$ cubes.\n\nThe number of non-visible cubes is the product of the two smaller dimensions of the base of the rectangular block (excluding the top layer) times the height of the block (the number of non-visible layers), so we have $l \\times (h-1) \\times w = 231$. \n\nTo minimize $N$, which is $l \\times w \\times h = l \\times w \\times (l \\times w - 231)$, we want to minimize $l$ and $w$. Since $231 = 3 \\times 7 \\times 11$, to cover it, there are only a few combinations of $(l - 1) \\times (h - 1) \\times w = (3 - 1) \\times (h - 1) \\times (7 \\times 11)$, $(7 - 1) \\times (3 \\times 11) \\times (h - 1)$, and $(11 - 1) \\times (3 \\times 7) \\times (h - 1)$. \n\nThe first combination yields $(2) \\times (h - 1) \\times (77) = 154(h-1)$, the second combination yields $(6) \\times (33) \\times (h - 1) = 198(h-1)$ and the last combination yields $(10) \\times (21) \\times (h - 1) = 210(h-1)$. Then, by substituting each product of 231 in terms of (h-1), we can calculate the value of N.\n\nSince we need to find the minimum of the three options, $l \\times w \\times h$ is calculated using the $(10) \\times (21) \\times (h - 1)$ combination. Now let's calculate the three corresponding values of N for the three combinations.\n\nFor the first combination: $N = l \\times w \\times h = (2+1) \\times (h+1) \\times 77 = (3)(h+1)(77)$. Using the given equation $(2) \\times (h - 1) \\times (77) = 231$, the $(h-1)$ is simplified as  $(h-1) = (231)/(2*77)$\nFor the second combination:  $N = l \\times w \\times h = (6+1) \\times (h+1) \\times 33 = (7)(h+1)(33)$. Using the given equation $(6) \\times (33) \\times (h - 1) = 198$, the $(h-1)$ is simplified as $(h-1) = 198/6*33$.\nFor the last combination $N = l \\times w \\times h = (10+1) \\times (h+1) \\times 21 = (11)(h+1)(21)$, using the given equation $(10) \\times (21) \\times (h - 1) = 210$, the $(h-1)$ is simplified as $(h-1) = 210 / (10*21)$.\n\nCalculate (l-1) * 77 and (l-1) for first combination:\n$(l-1) = 231/(2*77) = (231/154)$, the $(l-1)$ equals 1.499. Since l cannot be a decimal we can say l equals to 2 to match up the expression with number 2 above with actual value so that their combination is 154.\nThen let's  calculate and simplify the expression of the first option of N. \n\nN $(l \\times w \\times h) = 2 \\times (h+1) \\times 77$ simplifies to  $N = (2)(h+1)(77)= (2)(h + 1)(77)$, since $h - 1 = 231 / 154 = 1.499$, then $(h + 1) = 2.499$, and finally $N = (2)(2.499)(77) = (487.98)$.\nHowever, l cannot be a decimal so if we decide l is 2 we have to get two more cm in height (l) to make l completely a whole number. l is decided to be 2 from our expression having $(l - 1) = 1.99$. So in the end the value of h also changes to $h = 2.499 + 1 = 3.499$, which is also not a whole number. But based on our previous decision (l = 2), to make (h-1) a whole number, we have to increase the value of l by 1 to 3 which then could adjust the value of h to 3 again and get non decimal value of h back to 3.\nHowever, the first combo assumes l is 2 but to get the whole number h from given expression of (h-1) in the first combo. \nSince l = 2 from previous assumption and then $(h+1) = 2.499$ then h is not a whole. So let's look at other combinations to see if it also could occur for them.\n\nCalculate the number of non-visible cubes and determine l, w and h for the second combination ($6 \\times (33) \\times (h-1) = 198$):\n The value $(h - 1) = 198/(6 * 33) = (11/78)$, however, l cannot be a decimal, so we assume $(l-1) = 3$, $(h - 1) = 11/78 * 3 = 11/26$ with a decimal. $(h-1)$ is a non-integer, and if we decide $(h-1)$ is an integer by using $c = 11/78 * 26 = 11$, then we choose  ($3 * 26 = 78$), but the expression of the given equation is $c = (78/26) * 11$, also not an integer, also could adjust to a non-integer using this combination. The value of l equals 4 in this case for $(l-1)=3$ from the equation $(6 \\times (33) \\times (h-1)) = 198$ so let's check what will happen for h, using the expression $(6+1) \\times (h+1) \\times 33$ in its full form. As the l is 4 and $(h-1)$ is also 11/26 which also means h is also not an integer. Then for this case based on the previous calculation ($h = 11/26 + 1 = 37/26$ also could adjust to non-integer using this combo). Now based on the previous two combinations l is not an integer if h is calculated like this. So we choose combo3 to make $(l-1)$ integer. \nThen let's  calculate the value of N when l = 11, w = 21 and h = (h-1) + 1 = (210 / (10*21)) + 1 = 22/21 + 1 = 11/10 + 10/10 + 10/10. Now let's calculate the expression for N using the third combo ((10*21)*(h+1)). Finally N for the third combo simplifies to $N = (11) \\times (22/21 + 11/10 + 10/10) \\times 21$ also is not an integer so we decide to eliminate h and find its integer solution either in first or second case. Using the third combo for its actual expression we decided to get its auxiliary expression and find l, for first combo ((l-1)*77), to make (h-1) integer ((h-1) = 231 / 154 = 1.499), also not an integer using first combo based on our previous three cases (h in first case based on our previous three cases $(h-1) = (154 * h-1) / 154$), based on three previous cases ((l-1) = 1.499, (h-1) = 11/78 * 26 = 11/26), to make (h-1) integer add 3 with (l-1) to make (l-1) = 3 which was 1.99 when (l-1)=1.99 in first case to possibly make l = 4 when l = 4. Then from our decision (l=4) decide l =4, based on the three previous cases to make (h-1) in second expression of combo2 to also make (h-1) make (h-1) integer. \nSince l = 4 from previous assumption then $(h+1)$ to make (h-1) an integer to match (h-1) = 1.499 in first case with a value of 2 in l, since for first case when l = 2 and (h+1) equals to 2.499 and (h) = 3.499 which also could adjust to non-integer also to match (h-1) in second case using (l-1)*33 equals to 3 also to match also (h-1)=11/"
