    "To find the largest integer k such that P is divisible by 3^k, we need to count the number of factors of 3 in the product of the first 100 positive odd integers.\n\nFirst, let's express the product of the first 100 positive odd integers as a formula. The product can be written as:\n\n1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 199\n\nNow, let's find the number of factors of 3 in this product. We can do this by counting the number of multiples of 3 in the product.\n\nThere are 50 multiples of 3 between 1 and 199, so we have 50 factors of 3 from the 3's in each of these numbers.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the multiples of 9 (3^2) in the product, as they contribute two factors of 3. There are 17 multiples of 9 between 1 and 199.\n\nMoreover, we need to consider the multiples of 27 (3^3) in the product, as they contribute three factors of 3. There are 6 multiples of 27 between 1 and 199.\n\nFinally, we need to consider the multiples of 81 (3^4) in the product, as they contribute four factors of 3. There are 2 multiples of 81 between 1 and 199.\n\nSo, the total number of factors of 3 in the product is:\n\n50 (from 3's) + 2 \u00d7 17 (from 9's) + 3 \u00d7 6 (from 27's) + 4 \u00d7 2 (from 81's)\n\n= 50 + 34 + 18 + 8\n= 110\n\nTherefore, the largest integer k such that P is divisible by 3^k is 110.\n\nSo the answer is: $\\boxed{110}$",
    "To solve this problem, we first need to find the product of the first 100 positive odd integers. \n\nWe can write the product as:\n\\[\nP = 1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdots 197 \\cdot 199\n\\]\n\nNow we will use the formula for the product of the first $n$ odd positive integers: It is $n^2 \\cdot (n^2 - 1) \\cdot (n^2 - 3)\\cdots 3 \\cdots 1$ i.e., product of first n odd natural numbers  of the form $n^2 \\cdot (n^2 - 1) \\cdot (n^2 - 3) \\cdots (3 \\cdot 1)$.\nHowever for the 100 positive odd integers, we don't need to manually start at the first odd number since we know its 1st form can't start in 1 because of being an even number. what can be is $(1) of n (odd) \\times (n-1)\\times (n-3) \\times \\cdots \\times 3 \\times 1$.\nHowever we don't need manually start from the beginning since factoring will suffice to get number in respective exponents like doing $2^{a} * 3^{b}$ versus manually summing $2^{1} * 3^{1}$, $4^{1} * 3^{1}$ etc etc till we get to $100^{2}$.\n\nThe given number $P$ of first hundred odd is in of the form \n$(1 \\times 3) * (3 \\times 5) * (5 \\times 7) * (7 \\times 9) * (9 \\times 11) * (11 \\times 13) * (13 \\times 15) * (15 \\times 17) * (17 \\times 19) * (19 \\times 21) * (21 \\times 23) * (23 \\times 25) * (25 \\times 27) * (27 \\times 29) * (29 \\times 31) * (31 \\times 33) * (33 \\times 35) * (35 \\times 37) * (37 \\times 39) * (39 \\times 41) * (41 \\times 43) * (43 \\times 45) * (45 \\times 47) * (47 \\times 49) * (49 \\times 51) * (51 \\times 53) * (53 \\times 55) * (55 \\times 57) * (57 \\times 59) * (59 \\times 61) * (61 \\times 63) * (63 \\times 65) * (65 \\times 67) * (67 \\times 69) * (69 \\times 71) * (71 \\times 73) * (73 \\times 75) * (75 \\times 77) * (77 \\times 79) * (79 \\times 81) * (81 \\times 83) * (83 \\times 85) * (85 \\times 87) * (87 \\times 89) * (89 \\times 91) * (91 \\times 93) * (93 \\times 95) * (95 \\times 97) * (97 \\times 99)$\n\nAnalyzing the product and breaking it down into the form $n^{a} * p^{b}$, we get \n$P = 3^{49} \\cdot 7^{24} \\cdot 5^{19} \\cdot 11^{12} \\cdot 13^8 \\cdots 3^6 \\cdots 97 \\cdots 99$\n\nThe largest power of $3$ is $49$",
    "To find the largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k$, we need to find out the number of times $3$ appears in the prime factorization of $P$.\n\nFirst, we can express $P$ as the product of the first $100$ positive odd integers:\n\\[\nP = 1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot \\dots \\cdot 199\n\\]\n\nWe know that for any product of consecutive odd numbers, we can express it as the product of the first $n$ positive odd integers as\n\\[\nn! = n(n-2)(n-4)\\cdots17\\cdot15\\cdot13\\cdot11\\cdot9\\cdot7\\cdot5\\cdot3\\cdot1\n\\]\nHowever, for the series of odd integers where the $n$th odd number is given as $n = 2n'$, the product can simply be written as\n\\[\n1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdots (2n'-1)\n\\]\n\nHowever, since our $P$ includes the first $100$ positive odd integers, we can simply write the $100$th odd positive integer as $199$. We have to determine how many times $3$ appears in the prime factorization of this product.\n\nEvery third odd number contains a factor of 3, and we have $3, 9, 15, 21, 27, \\dots, 195$. This pattern adds factors of 3, where the 3rd adds one factor of 3, the 9th adds one factor of 3, and the 15th adds one factor of 3 and so on.\n\nThis pattern can be described by the expression $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3^j}\\right\\rfloor$, where the current index is $n = 199$. So the product of our $P$ will have  $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{199}{3}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{199}{3^2}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{199}{3^3}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{199}{3^4}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{199}{3^5}\\right\\rfloor = 66 + 22 + 7 + 2 + 0 = 97$\n\n Therefore, the largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k$ is the answer.\n\n$\\boxed{97}$"
