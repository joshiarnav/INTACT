    "To find the least possible value of m+n satisfying the given conditions, let's start by analyzing each condition individually.\n\n1. $\\quad\\bullet\\ \\gcd(m+n,210)=1$\n\nThis condition implies that the greatest common divisor of (m+n) and 210 must be 1. This suggests that m+n should be a number that is not divisible by any of the prime factors of 210. The prime factorization of 210 is $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7$. Therefore, m+n should not be divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n2. $\\quad\\bullet\\ m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n,$\n\nThis implies that the sum of m and n is significant enough to create a multiple of $m^m$ that also includes $n^n$. This could be achieved if m is a power of n or vice versa. \n\n3. $\\quad\\bullet\\ m$ is not a multiple of $n.$\n\nThis suggests that m and n are not related by an integer multiple, i.e., m = kn for some integer k where k is not equal to 1.\n\nGiven the above conditions, let's work towards finding suitable m and n values.\n\nFor a simple power of n to be a multiple of $m^m$, let m = n^k where n is not a multiple of n. In order to satisfy the condition that $\\gcd(m+n,210)=1,$ we need to ensure that m+n does not have 2, 3, 5, or 7 as its factors.\n\nOne simple approach could be to choose n = 9 as this ensures that m+n is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. So, we have n = 9 and m must be n^k.\n\nm^m is a multiple of $n^n$ if m is at least n, so we have m = n^2, i.e., m = 9^2 = 81.\n\nThe lowest n^m is the number $9^2$ which fulfills the second condition, this prime factorization doesn't contain 2,3,5, or 7. Since m is not a multiple of n and n is prime, prime factorization of m is $3^8$.\n\nTherefore, $m+n$ = $81+9$ = 90, but we can see that $\\gcd(90,210)=30 \\ne 1$. We need another number.\n\nConsider the next option, where we set n = 11 since n is not a multiple of 2, 3, 5, or 7. Then, m = n^2 = 121 and the lowest $m^m$ is the number $11^2$ which fulfills the condition for $m^m$ being multiple of $n^n$. The prime factorization of m is $11^4$.\n\nTherefore, $m+n$ = $121+11$ = 132, but $\\gcd(132,210)=6 \\ne 1$.\n\nWe need to keep increasing n:\nNow consider $n=11^2$ which also isn't divisible by 2,3,5, or 7, setting m=n^k results in prime factorization in $m^m$.\n\nHowever, we can't keep increasing n indefinitely. We need to find the lowest possible n that satisfies both conditions $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1$ and $m^m$ a multiple of $n^n,$ while avoiding a multiple of n.\n\nThe lowest n^2 is $11^2=121$, the lowest prime number prime factorization is $11^4,$  $m^m=11^8$.\n\nThe lowest $m^m$ prime factorization is $11^{11}$.\n\n\n\nWith the lowest $n^2=121$  and $m^m$ prime factorization $11^8$ or $11^{11}$, we should find a $m=sum(n)=10 prime number value,$ or other than multiple of 11.\n\n\n\nWe can see that using n=11, this results in a larger value for m than using n = 9.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to find the least possible value of $m+n.$ We can start by analyzing the given conditions:\n\n1. $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1$: This means that $m+n$ is not divisible by any of the prime factors of $210$, which are $2, 3, 5,$ and $7$.\n2. $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$: This implies that $n^n$ divides $m^m$. In other words, the prime factorization of $n^n$ must be a subset of the prime factorization of $m^m$.\n3. $m$ is not a multiple of $n$: This means that $m$ and $n$ have different prime factorizations.\n\nNow, we need to find a strategy to find the least possible value of $m+n$ that satisfies these conditions.\n\nSince we are looking for the least possible value of $m+n$, we should try to minimize both $m$ and $n$ while still satisfying the conditions.\n\nFirst, let's ignore the condition that $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1$ and try to find a possible solution that satisfies the other two conditions.\n\nWe can use the fact that $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$ to try to find a relationship between $m$ and $n$.\n\nOne possible relationship is $m = nk$, where $k$ is a positive integer.\n\nIn this case, $m^m = (nk)^m = n^mk^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$.\n\nFor $m^m$ to be a multiple of $n^n$, we need $m$ to have at least the same prime factors as $n$, but with a higher power.\n\nIn the next step let us consider  $n$ to be a prime number $p$.\n\nFor $m^m$ to be a multiple of $p^p$, $m$ needs to have at least $p^p$ as a factor.\n\nHowever, this would make $m$ a multiple of $n = p$, which contradicts the third condition that $m$ is not a multiple of $n$.\n\nTherefore, $n$ cannot be a prime number.\n\nNext, let's try to find a composite number $n$ that can satisfy the conditions.\n\nSince $n$ is not a prime number, let's consider $n$ to be the product of two prime numbers, $p$ and $q$.\n\nLet $n = p^aq^b$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct prime numbers and $a$ and $b$ are positive integers.\n\nWe need to find the smallest possible value of $m$ that satisfies the condition that $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n = (p^aq^b)^{a+b} = p^{a(a+b)}q^{b(a+b)}$.\n\nFor this to hold, we need $m$ to have at least $p^{a(a+b)}q^{b(a+b)}$ as a factor.\n\nSince $m$ is not a multiple of $n$, the prime factors of $m$ and $n$ must be distinct.\n\nWe also need to satisfy the condition that $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1$.\n\nLet's choose $p = 11$ and $q = 13$.\n\nWe can take $n = p^aq^b = 11^2 \\cdot 13 = 1573$.\n\nFor $m^m$ to be a multiple of $n^n$, we need $m$ to have at least $11^{2 \\cdot 3} \\cdot 13^{3 \\cdot 3} = 33^6 \\cdot 13^9$ as a factor.\n\nWe can take $m = 33^6 \\cdot 13^9 \\cdot k$, where $k$ is some positive integer.\n\nHowever, let's choose $m$ to be a product of $n$ and another number $k$, such that their sum has a prime factorization that is not shared with $210$.\n\nAnother strategy to try to find the solution could be to use  number $2^4 \\cdot 3^ 2 . \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$ and try to modify it  in order to ignore the components that are divisible by the components that are  within $210$.\n\nWe are going to use an alternative method , that instead of considering very large prime numbers, we will try to use the primes that are factors of $210$, or their product with some number.\n\nUsing the fact that $210 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, let's choose $p = 2^3  \\cdot 5 = 40$. Then $n = p = 40$ and because $m$ and $n$ are not multiples of each other we have $m \\geq 2 \\cdot 5 . \\cdot 7 \\cdot k$, where $k \\geq 2^3 \\cdot 3 . \\cdot 7$.\n\nWe are trying to satisfy $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1$.\n\nWe can also see that in order to  satisfy the conditions, we also need $m \\geq 3^a \\cdot k$, where $k \\geq 2^3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5 . \\cdot 7$.\n\nAnother condition to consider is that  in order for $m^m$ to be a multiple of $n^n$, we must have $m \\geq 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5  \\cdot 7 \\cdot k$, where $k \\geq 2^ 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 $.\n\nThe most difficult part , that is creating $k$.\n\nThis could be also creating a new number, that when we together with $2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7  $ will give us the components that satisfy all conditions.\n\nWe can use the fact  that, there exists a new number $ t$ such that $k = t , that when we add it to $ 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 $ will give us together $2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot k$ and thus  together satisfy the condition that  in order for $m^m$ to be a multiple of $n^n$.\n\nTo satisfy this, we also need $ t \\geq 3^ 3 \\cdot 2^3 \\cdot 7$.\n\n\n\nAfter that we should multiply this number by a number  that together with it  will give us  the  number that has  in its prime factorization components that satisfy all three conditions together.\n\nIn order to do that we can use number $d = 3 . \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, that together with the previously described number $2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5  \\cdot 7 \\cdot k = 3 . \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot t$  will give us $ t = 2^5 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot k ^ t$.",
    "To find the least possible value of $m+n$, we must first understand the given conditions and analyze the properties of $m$ and $n$.\n\nThe given conditions are:\n1. $\\gcd(m+n,210)=1$: This implies that the greatest common divisor of $m+n$ and $210$ is $1$.\n2. $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$: This condition suggests that the prime factors of $n$ are also present in $m$, but the powers of these factors in $m$ are at least as large as in $n$.\n3. $m$ is not a multiple of $n$: This condition implies that while $m$ and $n$ have common factors, $m$ is not a direct multiple of $n$.\n\nSince we want to find the smallest possible value of $m+n$, let's begin with small factors. \n\nThe prime factorization of $210$ is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. Considering the factors in $210$, we can define $n$ as $2^2 \\cdot 3^2$, and $m$ as $2^3 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$.\n\nIn this scenario, \n$n = 4 \\cdot 9 = 36$, and \n$m = 24 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 29160$.\n\nHowever, this choice of $m$ still makes it a multiple of $n$. We need to choose a value that still satisfies the second condition, but not the third.\n\nLooking at the previous result for $m, $ let's approach by adding 1, $m = 2^{3}3^{3}5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 2$, and $n = 2^{2}3^{2}.$ m+n will now be, $59 \\cdot 2^{3} 3^{3}5 \\cdot  7$.\n\nIt is now clear that m is not a multiple of $n$, but $gcd(m+n, 210)$ is no longer $1$; the greatest common divisor is $2$. In order to make $gcd(m+n, 210)=1$, let's attempt to keep  the other values of $m$ the same while making $n$ larger and $m+n$ smaller, keeping $m+n$ multiplied by a factor less than some  factor other than factors going into the number $210$. The other factors of $210$ would be based on  $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3}$, $\\sqrt{5}$, and $\\sqrt{7}$..These values make $m+n$ larger, and $gcd(m+n, 210)$ bigger -- a property that we want to keep  $1$.

Then $n = p = 40$ and because $m$ and $n$ are not multiples of each other we have $m \\geq 2 \\cdot 5 . \\cdot 7 \\cdot k$, where $k \\geq 2^3 \\cdot 3 . \\cdot 7$.\n\nWe are trying to satisfy $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1$.\n\nWe can also see that in order to  satisfy the conditions, we also need $m \\geq 3^a \\cdot k$, where $k \\geq 2^3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5 . \\cdot 7$.\n\nAnother condition to consider is that  in order for $m^m$ to be a multiple of $n^n$, we must have $m \\geq 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5  \\cdot 7 \\cdot k$, where $k \\geq 2^ 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 $.\n\nThe most difficult part , that is creating $k$.\n\nThis could be also creating a new number, that when we together with $2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7  $ will give us the components that satisfy all conditions.\n\nWe can use the fact  that, there exists a new number $ t$ such that $k = t , that when we add it to $ 2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 $ will give us together $2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot k$ and thus  together satisfy the condition that  in order for $m^m$ to be a multiple of $n^n$.\n\nTo satisfy this, we also need $ t \\geq 3^ 3 \\cdot 2^3 \\cdot 7$.\n\n\n\nAfter that we should multiply this number by a number  that together with it  will give us  the  number that has  in its prime factorization components that satisfy all three conditions together.\n\nIn order to do that we can use number $d = 3 . \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, that together with the previously described number $2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5  \\cdot 7 \\cdot k = 3 . \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot t$  will give us $ t = 2^5 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot k ^ t$.}$",
  "critique": "Solution 1 and Solution 3 are attempting to find the least possible value of $m+n$ by starting with small factors and trying to satisfy the conditions.

  "solution": "Taking inspiration from $4^4 \\mid 10^{10}$ we are inspired to take $n$ to be $p^2$, the lowest prime not dividing $210$, or $11 \\implies n = 121$. Now, there are $242$ factors of $11$, so $11^{242} \\mid m^m$, and then $m = 11k$ for $k \\geq 22$. Now, $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = \\gcd(11+k,210) = 1$. Noting $k = 26$ is the minimal that satisfies this, we get $(n,m) = (121,286)$. Thus, it is easy to verify this is minimal and we get $\\boxed{407}$.",
