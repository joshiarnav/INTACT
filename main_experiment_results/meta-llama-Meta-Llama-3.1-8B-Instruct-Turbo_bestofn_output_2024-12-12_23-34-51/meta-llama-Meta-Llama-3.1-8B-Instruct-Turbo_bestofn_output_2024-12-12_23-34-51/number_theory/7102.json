    "Let's break it down step by step.\n\nWe are given that $A_n$ is an $n$-digit integer each of whose digits is equal to $a$, and similarly for $B_n$ and $C_n$.

Substituting the expressions for $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$, we get:\n\n$c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n}-1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n-1}{9} = \\left(a \\cdot \\frac{10^n-1}{9}\\right)^2$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n$10^n \\left(c \\cdot \\frac{10^n-1}{9} - b \\right) = \\left(a \\cdot \\frac{10^n-1}{9}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when $a = 1, b = 1, c = 2$. Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:\n\n$10^n \\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{10^n-1}{9} - 1 \\right) = \\left(1 \\cdot \\frac{10^n-1}{9}\\right)^2$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n$10^n \\left(\\frac{10^n+1}{9}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{10^n-1}{9}\\right)^2$\n\nExpanding the square and simplifying, we get:\n\n$10^n \\left(\\frac{10^n+1}{9}\\right) = \\frac{10^{2n} -2 +1}{81}$\n\n$8100^n\\left(10^n+1\\right) = 10^{2n}-1$\n\n$8100^nn^{2n} + 8100^nn = 9n^{2n}$\n\nThis equation is true when $n = 1$ and also true when $n = 2$, but fails for all values of $n$ greater than 2.\n\nNext, consider what happens when $a = 1, b = 4, c = 1$.

    "We begin by considering the properties of $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$. \n\nAs $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$ are congruent integers, their base-$10$ representations can be expressed as follows: \n\n$A_n$ can be written as $a\\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right \\rfloor \\cdot(2^n-1) + an \\cdot 2^{n-1}$, \n$B_n$ as $b \\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right \\rfloor \\cdot (2^n - 1) + b(2^n - n - 1)$, and \n$C_n$ as $c \\left \\lfloor \\frac{2n}{2} \\right \\rfloor \\cdot (2^n - 1) + c(2^n - n - 1) \\cdot (2^n - 1)$.\n\nPlugging these terms into the given equation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$, we obtain the following relation between $a$, $b$, $c$, and $n$:\n\n$$k = \\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right \\rfloor \\neq 0, \\ \\ \\beta = b(2^n-n-1), \\ \\ \\alpha^2 = a^2 \\left( 2(2^n-1) +2^{2n-1}n\\right)$$\nwhere $k$ and $\\beta$ are constants and $\\alpha$ is a function of $n$. \n\nWe now construct a Diophantine equation using these relations:\n\n$$\\beta = a^2 \\left( 2(2^n-1) +2^{2n-1}n\\right) -k (c-b) \\left(2^{n} - 1\\right)$$.\n\nSince we know that $\\beta$, $n$, and $\\alpha$ are integers, then $a^2\\left( 2(2^n-1) +2^{2n-1}n\\right)$ must also be an integer; therefore, $k = \\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right \\rfloor \\neq 0$ as well.\n\nSolving further for $\\beta$, we find that the possible values of $n$, and subsequently $k$, can be plugged into the first equation above to determine  $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right \\rfloor = k = a^2  - 1$.\n\nWe then have two equations to work with: \n$\\alpha^2 = a^2 \\left( 2(2^n-1) +2^{2n-1}n\\right) -k (c-b) \\left(2^{n} - 1\\right)$ and \n$\\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right \\rfloor = a^2 - 1 .$\n\nWe wish to select values for $a$, $b$, and $c$ that result in the maximum value for $a + b + c$. \n\nAfter considering cases, the $32$-digit number $C = 9 \\cdot(2^n - 1) \\cdot 19999 + a^2 \\cdot(2^{2n} - 1) - b \\cdot199(2^n - n - 1) =  (2^{2n} - 1)(a^2 - 1)$, leads to the relationship \n$$(2^{2n} - 1)(a^2 - 1) = (2^n - 1) \\left( 19999 \\cdot(9-c) \\right)  $$\nor \n$$ ( a^2 -1)(2^n -1) = (c - 9)(2^n - 1)(19999). $$ \nPlugging in another equation from our first case, we now find the relationship between $a$ and $b$: \n$$\n(b - a(2^n - n - 1))(2^n(2^n - 1) - (2^n-1)(2^n - n - 1) -19999) = (b - a(2^n - n - 1))(a^2 - 1)(19999).\n$$\n\nSetting the value of $( a(2^n(2^n - 1) - (2^n - 1)(2^n - n - 1) -19999) - b)$ to be zero for simplicity, we find the values $ a^2 - 1$, which must also hold true for our last equation $( b - a(2^n  - n - 1))(a^2 - 1)(19999) =  (b - a(2^n - n - 1))(a^2 - 1)(k)(2^n - 1)$.  \n\nSolving $( b - a(2^n  - n - 1))(a^2 - 1)(k)(2^n - 1) - ( b - a(2^n - n - 1))(a^2 - 1)(19999)$, we have $0 = (b - a(2^n - n - 1)) (k  - 19999) (a^2 - 1)$ for some nonzero integers $n$, $b(2^n - n - 1)$, and $a(2^n - n - 1)$.\n\nCombining the above properties of our previous equations, we start thinking about $( b - a(2^n  - n - 1)) (a^2 - 1)(19999) = (k - a^2 + 1) (b(2^n - n - 1))$ and find that we must have $k - a^2 + 1 = a^2 - 1$, since $a^2 - 1$ cannot be zero. Therefore, we deduce that $k - a^2 + 1$ should be nonzero.\n\nCombining properties of $a^2 - 1$ and $(k -19999)$ with $k - a^2 + 1 = a^2 - 1$, we start thinking about the probability of these two possible values for $n$ that we separate out: $19999$ as well as $a^2 - 1$.\n\nSetting the value of $( a^2 -1 - (a^2 - 1)19999)$ to be zero for simplicity, we find the values $ a^2 - 1$, which must also hold true for our last equation $( a^2 -1)^2 = 0.$ Solving for this for values of $a$ we separate out:  $32$, $9$, $10$, and $16$, so $a = 4$ is ruled out. \n\nTherefore, considering cases for the last equation and $20544 + 2880 = 22424 = 2^3(11^2(2^2 + 1))$, $k = 4$, we now have the relationship for $n$:\n$$ n = 2 \\cdot 4 .$$\n\nBecause $19999 > n$, it makes sense to try $19999$. Separating out $19999$ for our previous analysis, we start thinking about $(k-19999)(2^n-1) = b\\cdot19999$ and plug in our value of $20544$ to find that $b = 16$; therefore, we now have the relationship for $n$:\n$$\nn = 19999 + 8 .$$\nPlugging both values for $n$ into our equation $k = a^2 - 1$ to determine that both separate values for $a$ are equal to 9, we find that our final answer is $a + b + c = \\boxed{16} .",
    "To approach this problem, we need to express the given integers $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$ in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$. \n\nWe have $A_n = a(1+10+\\cdots+10^{n-1})$, which can be rewritten as $A_n = a\\left(\\frac{10^n-1}{9}\\right)$. Similarly, $B_n = b\\left(\\frac{10^n-1}{9}\\right)$ and $C_n = c\\left(\\frac{10^{2n}-1}{9}\\right)$.\n\nWe are given that $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$, which we can rewrite as $\\left(\\frac{10^{2n}-1}{9}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{10^n-1}{9}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{10^n-1}{9}\\right)^2$. This simplifies to:\n\n$$\\frac{10^{2n}-1-(10^n-1)}{9}=\\frac{(10^n-1)^2}{81}\\Rightarrow \\frac{10^{2n}-10^n}{9}=\\frac{(10^n-1)^2}{81}$$\n\nNow we can simplify the left-hand side of the equation. Multiplying both sides by $81$ and expanding the right-hand side, we get\n\n$$9\\cdot(10^{2n}-10^n)-(10^n-1)^2=0.$$We factor out $(10^n-1)$ and we have\n\n$$9\\cdot(10^n-1)\\cdot (10^n+1)-(10^n-1)^2=(10^n-1)(81-1)=80\\cdot(10^n-1).$$ \n\nWe now simplify to get:\n\n$$8\\cdot(10^n-1)=81\\cdot10^n-10^n=(80+81)\\cdot 10^n-10^n.$$ \nNext, we factor $10^n$ on the right side of this equation to get:\n $8\\cdot(10^n-1)=10^n\\cdot (81-1)=80\\cdot 10^n.$\nDividing both sides of this equation by $10^n$, we get\n$8$ $\\boxed{\\frac{10^n-1}{10^n}=8}$ and further simplify to get\n$\\frac{1}{10^n}=1-8=\\frac{-7}{10^n}.$ Now, this expression is a positive fraction only if $n$ is a positive integer. The positive fraction $\\frac{-7}{10^n}$ is an integer if and only if the positive integer $n$ is a multiple of $3$.\n\nFor each of these positive integer values of $n$, we have $10^n$ values of $m$ such that $10^n=\\frac{10}{9}\\cdot (10^m-1)=\\frac{10^{m+1}-10^m}{9}$. \nThus, the value of $m+1$ is not unique for a given $n$.\nFor example, for $n=3$, both $m=1$ and $m=4$ satisfy the given equation, so we can use $(n,m)=(3,1)$ or $(n,m)=(3,4)$. This shows that we are not limited to a unique value of $m$ for a given $n$, but we can use different values of $m$ for each $n$ we consider. \n\nFor a given value of $n$, the $(10^n-1)$ in our equation is equal to $9(10^m-1)$ for some value of $m$, which is less than $n$. Thus, $9\\cdot (10^n-1)$ is less than or equal to $9\\cdot 10^m$ for all values of $n$ and $m$ that are greater than or equal to $1$. This means that our equation $8\\cdot (10^n-1)=80\\cdot (10^n)$ is an inequality when $(n,m)$ is $(3,1)$ or $(3,4)$.\n\nFor $(n,m)=(3,1)$, the left-hand side of the inequality is $80$ while the right-hand side of the inequality is $80\\cdot10^3$, so it is possible for $(n,m)$ to be $(3,1)$ to be in our solution set.\n\nHowever, this contradicts our requirement that $(10^n-1)$ $(n,m)$ must be $(3,4)$ for our equation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$ to have some valid solutions. \n\nThus, the values of $m$ that work are values of $m$ such that $10^m$ is a divisor of $80$ but $10$ is not. \n\nThe positive integer factorization of $80$ is:\n\n$$80=2^4\\cdot 5.$$ The positive factorization of $10$ that we have eliminated is $10=2\\cdot5$, which eliminated the values $(n,m)$ such that $m<4$.\n\nThus, the only positive factorization of $80$ that we have to consider is $80=2^4$ or $80=5$, which are equivalent to\n\n$$\\left(10^m\\right)^2=2^8$$ or $$\\left(10^m\\right)^2=5^2.$$ Taking square roots of both sides in each of these two equations, we get\n\n$$10^m=2^4$$ or $$10^m=5.$$ However, we are looking for integers $m$, which must be greater than or equal to $4$, so neither of these two equations yield any solutions. \n\nFor $m$ $\\ge 4$, we can list the factors of $80$: $80, 40, 16, 10, 8, 4, 2$ all of which are less than $80$. \n\nFor our equation, the $n$ we use is $n=4$ (we can use other values of $n$ such that $n \\ge 4$ to also generate solutions, but we can use the positive factors $80, 40, 16,$ and $10$ to generate just $4$ of them). Taking the square root of each of the factors we have in order to get the positive factors of $80$, we get:\n\n$$\\sqrt 80=8.944$$\n\n$$\\sqrt{40}=6.324$$\n\n$$\\sqrt 16=4$$\n\n$$\\sqrt{10}=3.16$$\n\n$$\\sqrt8=2.828$$\n\n$$\\sqrt4=2$$\n\n$$\\sqrt 2=1.414$$\n\nSince we eliminated the values such that $(n,m)$ is $(m,1)$ in the positive factorization $80=2\\cdot 5 \\cdot 5$, and since we found that we can use $(n,m)$ such that $m$ is $\\ge 4$, we can list the possible values of $n$ such that $n\\ge 4$ and we can generate a solution:\n\n$$(n,m) \\in \\{(4,4),(4,8),(4,16),(4,32)\\}.$$ \n\nThis set of solutions $(n,m)$ is the solution set $\\mathcal{N}$ that we were looking for. Now we look for the largest sum of a, b, and c given in the problem that also satisfies the required conditions $(n,m) \\in (\\mathcal{N})$. \n\nFor $(n,m) = (4,4)$, $C_n = 4\\cdot (10^8-1)/9$, $B_n = 2\\cdot (10^8-1)/9$, and $A_n^2= (81\\cdot16^2-1)/9^2$. \n\nWe now calculate $C_n-B_n$:\n\n$$\\frac{10^8-1}{9}\\cdot \\frac{4-2}{1}=\\frac{10^8-1}{4\\cdot9}.$$ Then we calculate $A_n^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{81\\cdot16^2-1}{81^2}=\\frac{6^4\\cdot81-1}{6^4\\cdot81}=\\frac{6^4-1}{6^4}\\cdot\\frac{6^4\\cdot81}{6^4\\cdot81}=\\frac{1295}{6^4}.$$ \n\nWe have:\n\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} \\frac{10^8-1}{4\\cdot9}&=&\\frac{10^8-1}{4\\cdot3^2} \\\\ &=&\\frac{10^8}{4\\cdot3^2}-\\frac{1}{4\\cdot3^2} \\\\ &=& \\frac{10^8}{36}-\\frac{1}{36} \\\\ &=& (\\frac{10^8}{36})-\\frac{1}{36} \\\\ &=& \\frac{10^8}{36} -\\frac{1}{36} \\cdot \\frac{35}{35} \\\\ &=& \\frac{10^8}{36} -\\frac{35}{36 \\cdot 35} \\\\ &=& \\frac{10^8}{36}-\\frac{1}{36} \\cdot \\frac{5\\cdot 7}{5\\cdot7} \\\\ &=& \\frac{10^8}{36}-\\frac{5\\cdot7}{5\\cdot7 \\cdot36}\\\\ &=& \\frac{10^8}{36}-\\frac{5\\cdot7}{5\\cdot 7\\cdot 36"

  "solution": "Observe $A_n = a(1 + 10 + \\dots + 10^{n - 1}) = a \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$; similarly $B_n = b \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ and $C_n = c \\cdot \\tfrac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}$. The relation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$ rewrites as\\[c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = a^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\right)^2.\\]Since $n > 0$, $10^n > 1$ and we may cancel out a factor of $\\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ to obtain\\[c \\cdot (10^n + 1) - b = a^2 \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}.\\]This is a linear equation in $10^n$. Thus, if two distinct values of $n$ satisfy it, then all values of $n$ will. Now we plug in $n=0$ and $n=1$ (or some other number), we get $2c - b = 0$ and $11c - b= a^2$ .
