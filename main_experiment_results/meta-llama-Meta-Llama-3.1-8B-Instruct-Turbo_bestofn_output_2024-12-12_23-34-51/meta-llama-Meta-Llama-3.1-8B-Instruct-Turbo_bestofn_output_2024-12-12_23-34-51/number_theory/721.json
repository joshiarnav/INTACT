    "To find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to find the pattern for odd multiples of 3. Since odd numbers can be represented as 2n + 1 and multiples of 3 can be represented as 3n, we combine these two to get 3(2n + 1) = 6n + 3. This is our pattern for odd multiples of 3.\n\n2. To find the 10th positive integer that follows this pattern, we need to find the modulus of the sequence (6n + 3) when n is a positive integer with 9 other integers in the sequence (n = 1, 2, ..., 10), in this case, adding up to 10.\n\n3. Let's test the modulus with values of n from 1 to 10: \n- For n = 1, 6n + 3 = 9\n- For n = 2, 6n + 3 = 15\n- For n = 3, 6n + 3 = 21\n- For n = 4, 6n + 3 = 27\n- For n = 5, 6n + 3 = 33\n- For n = 6, 6n + 3 = 39\n- For n = 7, 6n + 3 = 45\n- For n = 8, 6n + 3 = 51\n- For n = 9, 6n + 3 = 57\n- For n = 10, 6n + 3 = 63\n\n4. We can see that the pattern continues with each step of the value of n increasing the value of 6n + 3 by 6. Therefore, the tenth value would be 63.\n\nSo, the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is $\\boxed{63}$.",
    "To find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Since the integer must be odd, we can write it as 2k + 1, where k is an integer (this is the general form of an odd number).\n2. Since the integer must also be a multiple of 3, we can write it as 3m, where m is an integer (this is the general form of a multiple of 3).\n3. Combining these two conditions, we can write the number as 6m + 3 (because the LCM of 2 and 3 is 6, and 6m represents the part that must be a multiple of 3, while 3 agrees with the condition 2k +1).\n4. We need the tenth positive integer that satisfies this condition. To find this, we'll start listing out the first few multiples of 3 that agrees with 2k + 1:\n\n   6m + 3 is: \n   3 (for m = 0, agrees with 3, but 3 is not of the form 2k +1)\n   9 (for m = 1, agrees with 9, which is of the form 2k +1 with 2k = 8)\n   15 (for m = 2, agrees with 15, which is of the form 2k +1 with 2k = 14)\n   21 (for m = 3, agrees with 21, which is of the form 2k +1 with 2k = 20)\n   27 (for m = 4, agrees with 27, which is of the form 2k +1 with 2k = 26)\n   33 (for m = 5, agrees with 33, which is of the form 2k +1 with 2k = 32)\n   39 (for m = 6, agrees with 39, which is of the form 2k +1 with 2k = 38)\n   45 (for m = 7, agrees with 45, which is of the form 2k +1 with 2k = 44)\n   51 (for m = 8, agrees with 51, which is of the form 2k +1 with 2k = 50)\n   57 (for m = 9, agrees with 57, which is of the form 2k +1 with 2k = 56)\n\n   These are all positive integers that are odd and a multiple of 3.\n\nSo, the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is $\\boxed{57}$.",
    "To find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Odd and multiple of 3:** \n   First, we need to remember that a number can be both odd and a multiple of 3, if and only if the number is a multiple of 15. This is because 15 is the least common multiple of 3 and 5, and since any multiple of 15 is a multiple of 3 and 5, it must also be a multiple of 1 (hence odd).\n\n2. **List of multiples of 15:** \n   We will now list the first ten multiples of 15 and look for the tenth term.\n   Since 15 is the smallest multiple of 15, we will use this as our starting point and find the subsequent nine multiples.\n   The first ten multiples of 15 are: $15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150$.\n\n3. **Identify the tenth multiple:** \n   The tenth multiple of 15 from our list is 150.\n\nSo, the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is $\\boxed{150}$."
