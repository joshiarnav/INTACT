    "To find the units digit of n, we first need to find the units digit of 21^6. \n\nWe can start by finding the units digit of powers of 1 (21 is congruent to 1 mod 10). \n\n- 1^1 has a units digit of 1\n- 1^2 has a units digit of 1\n- 1^3 has a units digit of 1\n- 1^4 has a units digit of 1\n- 1^5 has a units digit of 1\n- 1^6 has a units digit of 1\n\nTherefore, the units digit of 21^6 is 1.\n\nNow, we know that the units digit of mn is 1, and the units digit of m is 7. Since the units digit of mn is the product of the units digits of m and n, we can find the units digit of n by dividing 1 by 7 modulo 10.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly divide by 7. To find the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 10, we need to find a number a such that 7a \u2261 1 (mod 10).\n\nWe can try out different values for a by calculating 7a modulo 10:\n\n- 7(1) \u2261 7 (mod 10)\n- 7(2) \u2261 14 \u2261 4 (mod 10)\n- 7(3) \u2261 21 \u2261 1 (mod 10)\n\nTherefore, the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 10 is 3.\n\nThis means that the units digit of n is the multiplicative inverse of the units digit of m, which is 3.\n\nSo, the units digit of n is 3.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "To find the units digit of $n$, we first need to determine the units digit of $21^6$.\n\nThe units digit of a number raised to a power follows a pattern, which repeats every 4 powers:\n\n- $1^1 = 1$, $1^2 = 1$, $1^3 = 1$, $1^4 = 1$, ...\n- $3^1 = 3$, $3^2 = 9$, $3^3 = 7$, $3^4 = 1$, ...\n- $7^1 = 7$, $7^2 = 9$, $7^3 = 3$, $7^4 = 1$, ...\n\nNotice that the units digit of $21$ is $1$. \n\n- $1^1 = 1$\n- $1^2 = 1$\n- $1^3 = 1$\n- $1^4 = 1$\n\nSince the pattern repeats, $21^6$ has the same units digit as $1^6$ i.e $1^6$ has the units digit of 1, but since 1 raised to any power will be 1 - the units digit will be 1 whether you multiply by 6 or, for instance, 99999 (all units digits are 9). Hence the units digit is 1. \n\nSince the product $mn$ has a units digit of $1$ and $m$ has a units digit of $7$, we need to find a number whose product with $7$ ends in $1$.

    "To find the units digit of $n$, we need to find the units digit of $21^6$ and then determine which digit multiplied by 7 gives us the same units digit as $21^6$.\n\nFirst, let's find the units digit of $21^6$. \n\nFor the number $21^1$, the units digit is 1 (since 21 ends with 1). \n\nNow, for the units digit of powers of 21: \n- $21^2$ ends with 1 (since 21 * 1 ends with 1)\n- $21^3$ ends with 1 (since 1 * 1 ends with 1)\n- $21^4$ ends with 1 (since 1 * 1 ends with 1)\n- $21^5$ ends with 1 (since 1 * 1 ends with 1)\n- $21^6$ ends with 1 (since 1 * 1 ends with 1)\n\nThe units digit of $21^6$ is 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the units digit of $n$, such that $n$ multiplied by 7 ends with 1. We will test the units digits of the numbers: 1, 7, 3, 9. \n\nWhen 1 * 7 is calculated, the result is 7, which does not end with 1.\n\nWhen 7 * 7 is calculated, the result is 49, which does not end with 1.\n\nWhen 3 * 7 is calculated, the result is 21, which does not end with 1.\n\nWhen 9 * 7 is calculated, the result is 63, which does not end with 1.\n\nWhen 7 * 3 is calculated, the result is 21 (already calculated).\n\nWhen 7 * 9 is calculated, the result is 63 (already calculated).\n\nHowever, when 7 * (anything  ending with 7) is calculated, we may not see  any of the previously calculated options (i.e 7, 21, 63).\n\nHowever, we see (3 * 7) becomes 21 but when 7 is placed first digit (e.g 17), seven set to ( any number ending in 3)."
