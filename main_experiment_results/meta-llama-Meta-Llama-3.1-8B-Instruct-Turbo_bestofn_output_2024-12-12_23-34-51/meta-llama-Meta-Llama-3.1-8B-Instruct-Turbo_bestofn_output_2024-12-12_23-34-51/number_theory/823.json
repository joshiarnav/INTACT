    "To find the fraction of all \"clever integers\" that is divisible by 27, we first need to identify all \"clever integers\". \n\nA \"clever integer\" has the following properties: \n- It is even. \n- It is greater than 20. \n- It is less than 120. \n- The sum of its digits is 9. \n\nLet's list all the even numbers greater than 20 and less than 120. They are 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, and 116 and 118. \n\nHowever, only even numbers whose digits sum to 9 will be clever integers. Let's consider all possibilities that meet the sum criteria and are within the range.\n\ni. 2 + x + y = 9  \n- When x = 7, y could be 0. This results in the number 70. However, 70 is not even.\n- When x = 6 and y = 3, this results in the number 63. However, 63 is not even, and even isn't required so we've included it here to consider all possibilities but, it only serves this purpose.\n- When x = 5 and y = 4, this results in the number 54.\n- When x = 4 and y = 5, this results in the number 45. However, 45 is not even.\n- When x = 3 and y = 6, this results in the number 36.\n- When x = 2 and y = 7, this results in the number 27. However, 27 is not even.\n- When x = 1 and y = 8, this results in the number 18. However, 18 is not even and not over 21 so we included it to look for other combinations, but was in error in its inclusion here as well as we only care for what we mentioned.\n\nii. 4 + x + y = 9\n- When x = 5, y could be 0. This results in the number 50, however, 50 is not even.\n- When x = 4 and y = 1, this results in the number 41, however, 41 isn't even.\n- When x = 3 and y = 2, this results in the number 32.\n- When x = 2 and y = 3, this results in the number 23; however it's not an even number.\n- When x = 1 and y = 4, this results in the number 14; however it is not within our 21 > integer > 120 criteria and is  also not even.\n- When x = 0 and y = 9, this results in the number 90.\n\niii. 6 + x + y = 9\n- When x = 3, y could be 0. However, 30 is not even.\n- When x = 2 and y = 1, this results in 21, however 21 is not even.\n- When x = 1 and y = 2, this results in 12.\n\niv. 8 + x + y = 9\n- When x = 1, y could be 0. This results in 10.",
    "To find the fraction of all clever integers that are divisible by 27, we first need to list all possible clever integers and then check those divisible by 27.\n\nA clever integer is an even integer greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9. \n\n1. The integers greater than 20 and less than 120 are from 21 to 119. \n2. Then, we filter these integers to only include even numbers. The numbers now would range from 22 to 118.\n3. Now we need the sum of the digits to be 9. \n\nThe possible cases are:\n\n- Two-digit numbers: \n  - The tens digit can only be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. \n  - And the units digit has a specific number that should be a single digit to be a two-digit number. The numbers are:\n    a. For a tens digit of 1, the units digit must be 8, because 18 is even.\n    b. For a tens digit of 2, the units digit must be 7, because 27 is even.\n    c. For a tens digit of 3, the units digit must be 6, because 36 is even.\n    d. For a tens digit of 4, the units digit must be 5, because 45 is odd.\n    e. For a tens digit of 5, the units digit must be 4, because 54 is even.\n    f. For a tens digit of 6, the units digit must be 3, because 63 is odd.\n    g. For a tens digit of 7, the units digit must be 2, because 72 is even.\n\n- Three-digit numbers: \n  - The hundreds digit can be any digit from 1 to 9.  \n  - For a three-digit number, we need to calculate the possible range for the tens and units digits to have their sum be 9.\n\nThe numbers that are even and the sum of the digits is 9 for two-digit numbers are: 36, 54, 72, 90. For three-digit numbers: 108, 117 is excluded as its not even. And 126, 135 is excluded as its not even. 144, 153 is excluded as its not even. 162, 171 is excluded as its not even. 198 is excluded as the condition that it is less than 120 is not met.\n\nTherefore, the possible clever integers are 36, 54, 72, 90, 108, 126, 144, 162, and 198. The numbers 108, 126 are not even ( therefore we do not count them), which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, 144 and 162.\n\nNow let's check which of these numbers are divisible by 27:\n\n- 36: not divisible by 27\n- 54: is divisible by 27\n- 72: not divisible by 27\n- 90: not divisible by 27\n- 144: not divisible by 27\n- 162: not divisible by 27\n\nSo only 54 is a clever integer and is divisible by 27.\n\nThere are 6 numbers in total which are 36, 54, 72, 90, 144, 162. Therefore, the fraction of clever integers that is divisible by 27 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",
    "To find the fraction of all clever integers that is divisible by 27, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find all the clever integers**:\n   - These integers are even and greater than 20 but less than 120.\n   - The sum of their digits must be 9.\n\nLet's list out all the possibilities:\n- For numbers like 27, 36, the maximum number available is 27 since 36 has a digit of 1 + 6 which equals 7. So all 3 digit numbers can start with 9 like 93 of which the digit sum will be 9 and that is 92, some numbers must be between 27 to 92, some have like 0s so 90, 99 as it can end with 0, and the start can have a range. So this would give: 27 is the lower number limitation and 99 as a higher limit limit for any. \n\n2. **Realize the clever integers between 27, and 99, and how they limit the potential clever integers**:\n   - These are possibilities: 27 is the lower number because we are of looking beyond 3 digit numbers limitation;
