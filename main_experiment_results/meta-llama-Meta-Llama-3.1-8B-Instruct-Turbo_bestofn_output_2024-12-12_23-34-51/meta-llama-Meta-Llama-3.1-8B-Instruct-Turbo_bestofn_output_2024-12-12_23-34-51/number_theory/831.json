    "We can rearrange the terms in $S$ by grouping consecutive terms in pairs: \n\n$S = (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + \\cdots + (2009 - 2010)$\n\nEach pair sums to $-1$. There are a total of $\\frac{2010}{2} = 1005$ pairs. \n\nSo, $S = 1005 \\times (-1) = -1005$. \n\nWe need to find the residue of $-1005$ modulo $2010$. To do this, we can add $2010$ to $-1005$ without changing its residue modulo $2010$. \n\n$-1005 + 2010 = 1005$. \n\nSince $1005$ is less than $2010$, $1005$ is the smallest positive residue of $-1005$ modulo $2010$.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{1005}$.",
    "To find the residue of $S$, modulo 2010, we can pair the terms as follows: \n\n$S = (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + \\cdots + (2009 - 2010)$\n\nEach pair has a sum of -1. Since there are 1005 pairs, the total sum is: \n\n-1 * 1005 = -1005\n\nHowever, since we want the residue modulo 2010, we need to add 2010 to -1005, until we get a positive number less than 2010.\n\n-1005 + 2010 = 1005 \n\nSo, the residue of $S$, modulo 2010, is $\\boxed{1005}$.",
    "To find the residue of $S$, modulo 2010, we will pair the terms in the series. Notice that $(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + \\cdots + (2009 - 2010)$ can be written as:\n\n$(-1) + (-1) + \\cdots + (-1)$\n\nSince there are 1005 pairs in the sequence ($\\left \\lfloor \\frac{2010}{2} \\right \\rfloor = 1005$), and each pair contains a $-1$, the value of S can be written as:\n\n$-1005$\n\nHowever, we need to consider the value modulo 2010. To do this, we add 2010 to the value of $S$, in order to get the smallest non-negative residue mod 2010. This gives us:\n\n$-1005 + 2010 = 1005$\n\nSo, the residue of S, modulo 2010 is $\\boxed{1005}$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They all arrive at the same answer, which is 1005. However, if I had to pick the best solution based on clarity and conciseness, I would choose Solution 1.\n\nSolution 1 is the most concise and directly addresses the problem. It uses a clear and concise explanation to pair the terms and calculate the sum, and then uses a simple explanation to find the residue modulo 2010.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1.",
  "solution": "Note that $x + 2010 \\equiv x \\pmod{2010}$. Add 2010 to every negative summand and rearrange the terms to find $S \\equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 2008 + 2009 \\pmod{2010}$. The right-hand side is the sum of the integers from 1 to 2010, so $S \\equiv \\frac{2010 \\cdot 2011}{2} \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 2011 \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 1 \\equiv \\boxed{1005} \\pmod{2010}$.",
