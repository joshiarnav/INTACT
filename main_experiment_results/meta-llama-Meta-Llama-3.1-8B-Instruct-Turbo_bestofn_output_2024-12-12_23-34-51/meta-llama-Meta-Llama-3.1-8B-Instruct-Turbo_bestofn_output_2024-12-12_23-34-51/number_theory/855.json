    "To find $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\pmod{25}$, let's first break it down step by step.\n\n1. We need to find the modular multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 25. In other words, we need to find an integer x such that $3x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$.\n\n2. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or simply try multiplying 3 with different integers until we get a number that is 1 more than a multiple of 25.\n\nTo find the inverse of 3 modulo 25, we see that $3*17 \\equiv 51 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$. So, $3^{-1} \\equiv 17 \\pmod{25}$.\n\n3. Now, we need to find $3^{-2}$ modulo 25. Since $3^{-2} \\equiv (3^{-1})^2$, and we know that $3^{-1} \\equiv 17 \\pmod{25}$, we can substitute to get:\n\n$3^{-2} \\equiv (3^{-1})^2 \\equiv 17^2 \\pmod{25}$\n$3^{-2} \\equiv 289 \\pmod{25}$\n$3^{-2} \\equiv 14 \\pmod{25}$\n\n4. Now, we can find $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\pmod{25}$:\n\n$3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\equiv 17 + 14 \\pmod{25}$\n$3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\equiv 31 \\pmod{25}$\n$3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}$\n\nSo, $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. However, I will analyze them for clarity, concision, and adherence to mathematical conventions.\n\nSolution 1 is clear and step-by-step, but it uses a trial-and-error approach to find the modular inverse, which may not be efficient for large numbers.\n\nSolution 2 is also clear and concise, but it uses the notation $(3^{-1})^2$ to represent the square of the modular inverse, which may be confusing for some readers.\n\nSolution 3 is the most concise and straightforward, using the correct mathematical notation and properties of modular arithmetic.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is:\n\n**2**",
  "solution": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 3 and 9 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 13 + \\frac 19 \\equiv \\frac{9 + 3}{27} \\equiv \\frac{12}{2} \\equiv \\boxed{6} \\pmod{25}.$$We can justify this as follows: let $a \\equiv 3^{-1} \\pmod{25}$ and $b \\equiv 9^{-1} \\pmod{25}$. Then $27a \\equiv 9 \\pmod{25}$ and $27b \\equiv 3 \\pmod{25}$. Summing these congruences shows that $27(a+b) \\equiv 2(a+b) \\equiv 9 + 3 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{25}$, so $a+b \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}$, as desired.",
