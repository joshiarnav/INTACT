    "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. When 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. This means that $60 = q \\cdot k^2 + 6$, where $q$ is the quotient.\n\n2. We can rewrite the equation as: $54 = q \\cdot k^2$\n\nSince 54 is divisible by 9, and $(k^2|54)$ where k^2| indicates 'k squared divides', and $k^2$ is a factor of 54, the factors of 54 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54.\n\n3. We can now find the values of $k^2$ by dividing 54 by each of these factors except 1.\n\n| k^2 value | factors of 54 |\n| 4 | 54/13 Divisible ( Won't work because of 13 isn't listed) |\n| 9 | 54/6 = 9   |\n| 6 | 54/9 = 6   |\n| 2 | 54/27 = 2  |\n| 1 | 54/54 = 1 |\n\n4. Only $k^2=4,9,6,2$ satisfy the given conditions.\n\n5. We need to find the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$. \n\nLet's consider each value of $k^2$.\n\n- If $k^2=4$, then $k=2$, since $k$ is a positive integer. We get $\\frac{100}{2} = 50$ with a remainder of 0.\n- If $k^2=9$, then $k=3$, since $k$ is a positive integer. We get $\\frac{100}{3} = 33$ with a remainder of 1.\n- If $k^2=6$, then $k=\\sqrt{6}$ is not an integer. Therefore, this value of $k^2$ does not satisfy the given conditions.\n- If $k^2=2$, then $k=\\sqrt{2}$ is not an integer. Therefore, this value of $k^2$ does not satisfy the given conditions.\n\nConsidering the value of $k^2$, we get the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$ is $\\boxed{1}$",
    "To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation using the given information that 60 divided by $k^2$ leaves a remainder of 6. This can be expressed as:\n\n60 = $k^2$q + 6\n\nwhere q is the quotient. \n\nWe can rearrange the equation to isolate the remainder term:\n\n54 = $k^2$q\n\nSince 54 is divisible by 9, 3, 2, 6, 18, and 27, and 54 is a multiple of $k^2$, then $k^2$ is likely one of the factors of 54.\n\nGiven that k is a positive integer, we can try simple factors of 54 for k that would yield a $k^2$ factor, such as k = 3, 6, 9, 18, or 27, to see if any of these yield a valid solution.\n\nConsidering each of these possible factors of 54:\n\n*   When k = 3, $k^2$ = 9. Plugging this into our rearranged equation, we have 54 = 9q. This gives a valid integer quotient q = 6, as 9 * 6 = 54.\n*   When k = 6, $k^2$ = 36, but plugging this into our equation yields 54 = 36q. This gives a non-integer quotient q.\n*   When k = 9, $k^2$ = 81, but plugging this into our equation yields 54 = 81q. This gives a non-integer quotient q.\n*   When k = 18, $k^2$ = 324, but plugging this into our equation yields 54 = 324q. This gives a non-integer quotient q.\n*   When k = 27, $k^2$ = 729, but plugging this into our equation yields 54 = 729q. This gives a non-integer quotient q.\n\nHowever, we're given that the remainder when 100 is divided by k. To find the remainder when 100 is divided by 3, we can use the division equation:\n\n100 = 3 * q + r\n\nHere, q is a quotient and r is the remainder. To find r, we can divide 100 by 3. \n\n100 = 33 * 3 + 1\n\nr = 1\n\nSo the remainder when 100 is divided by k is 1. \n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nGiven that when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6, we can write an equation for it:\n\n60 = q$k^2$ + 6\n\nwhere q is the quotient of the division.\n\nWe can subtract 6 from both sides to get:\n\n54 = q$k^2$\n\nNow, we can factor 54 into its prime factors:\n\n54 = 2 * 3^3\n\nSince $k^2$ divides 54, $k$ must be a factor of 54.\n\nThe factors of 54 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, and 54.\n\nWe are looking for the squares of these factors that divide 54.

  "critique": "Solution 1 has some errors in the factorization of 54 and the corresponding values of $k^2$.

  "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
