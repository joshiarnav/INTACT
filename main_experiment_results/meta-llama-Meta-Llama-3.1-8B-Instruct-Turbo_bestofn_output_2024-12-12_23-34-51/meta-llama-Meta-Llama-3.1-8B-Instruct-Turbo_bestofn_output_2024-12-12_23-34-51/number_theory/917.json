    "To find $2^{-1} \\pmod{185}$, we need to find a number $x$ such that $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$. \n\nOne way to do this is by using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. \n\nHowever, recognizing that 185 is $5 \\cdot 37$, and 2 is relatively prime to 185, we can find $2^{-1}$ by using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. \n\nSince $2 \\cdot 93 \\equiv 186 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$, we can conclude that $2^{-1} \\equiv 93 \\pmod{185}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n\n$\\boxed{93}$",

This means that $2x - 1$ is divisible by 185.\n\nStep 2: Since 185 is large, it's not easy to find $x$ directly.

  "critique": "Solution 1 is correct. It uses the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the modular inverse of 2 modulo 185.\n\nSolution 2 is correct but less efficient and more verbose.

It uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, but it does not correctly find the modular multiplicative inverse. It incorrectly calculates the value of x as 165, which is not the modular inverse of 2 modulo 185.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1.\n\nThe answer is: 1.",
