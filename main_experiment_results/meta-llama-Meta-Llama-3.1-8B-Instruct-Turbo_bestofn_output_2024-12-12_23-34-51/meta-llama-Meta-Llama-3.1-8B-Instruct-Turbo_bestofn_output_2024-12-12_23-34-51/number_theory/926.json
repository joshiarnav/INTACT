    "To find the integer $n$, we need to find a number such that when $7882$ is divided by $5$, the remainder is the same as when $n$ is divided by $5$.\n\nTo find the remainder of $7882$ when divided by $5$, we can simply look at the last digit of $7882$, which is $2$. When $2$ is divided by $5$, the remainder is $2$. \n\nSo, we need to find an integer $n$ between $4$ and $8$ such that when $n$ is divided by $5$, the remainder is $2$.\n\nPossible numbers between $4$ and $8$ are $4, 5, 6, 7, 8$. When we divide these numbers by $5$, the remainders are $4, 0, 1, 2, 3$ respectively.\n\nThe only number between $4$ and $8$ with a remainder of $2$ is $7$. \n\nSo, the integer $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "To find the value of n, we first need to find the remainder when 7882 is divided by 5.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the remainder of 7882 divided by 5. \nWe can do this by simply dividing 7882 by 5: 7882 / 5 = 1576.4. The remainder is the decimal part of this division, so 7882 divided by 5 equals 1576 remainder 2.\n\nStep 2: Since we have n \u2261 7882 (mod 5) and 7882 \u2261 2 (mod 5), we have n \u2261 2 (mod 5).\n\nStep 3: We need to find an integer n such that n \u2261 2 (mod 5) and 4 \u2264 n \u2264 8. Given that n is congruent to 2 modulo 5, we are looking for an integer in the interval [4,8] such that when divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 2. \n\nStep 4: Check each potential value in the interval [4,8]. Given that  4 divided by 5 equals remainder 4, 5 divided by 5 equals remainder 0,  6 divided by 5 equals remainder 1,  7 divided by 5 equals remainder 2, and 8 divided by 5 equals remainder 3.
