    "To find the common values between the two arithmetic progressions, we need to set up equations and solve them. The common difference in the first arithmetic progression is $5-2=3$, and the common difference in the second arithmetic progression is $10-3=7$. \n\nWe can represent the nth term of the first arithmetic progression as $a_1 = 2 + 3(n-1)$. Similarly, the mth term of the second arithmetic progression can be represented as $a_2 = 3 + 7(m-1)$.\n\nFor $a_1$ and $a_2$ to be equal, we can set up the equation: \n$2 + 3(n-1) = 3 + 7(m-1)$\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation.\n$2 + 3n - 3 = 3 + 7m - 7$\n$3n - 1 = 7m - 4$\n$3n = 7m + 3$\n\nTo find integer solutions for n and m, we need to find a common difference that can be factored from both sides. We can rewrite $3n = 7m + 3$ as $3n - 7m = 3$.\n\nWith integer solutions to the above equation, we are indirectly finding a situation in which both the arithmetic sequences will share a common value. To find integer solutions, we are trying to find linear Diophantine equations of the form $ax + by = n$, and $gcd(a, b)$ must divide $n$.\n\nTo proceed now effectively we will look for common differences that can generate $3$ as a result. Looking at the form of our line,$3n - 7m = 3$ with divisors for the two $gcd(3,7)=1$ we see that a $1$ needs to be factored out, to satisfy diophantine constraints. We get n = $8$ and $m = 5$ is indeed a solution but the  integer $1$ also is a valid choice indirectly speaking of nonetheless for your case as the wanted integer rest also showing a requested construct validity to simplify rest afterwards divisors for transformation usage is necessary) or divisors n=8 or m=7.\n\n\n\nThese integer solutions tell us that the 5th term of the first arithmetic progression ($2+3(4)=14$), the 8th term of the first progression ($2+3(7)= 22$), the 12th term of the first progression ($2+3(10)=32$, etc.), are equal to the terms of the second progression: the 2nd term of the second progression ($3 + 7(1)=10$), the 5th term of the second progression ($3 + 7(2)=17$), the 8th term ($3+7(3)$) and so on.\n\nLet's find the common terms that appear in both arithmetic progressions. We find $14, 59, 104, 149, 194, 239, 284, 329, 374, 419, 464, 509$ are some terms of both arithmetic progressions. Among these, $14, 59, 104, 149, 194, 239, 284, 329, 374, 419, 464$ are all less than $500$.\n\nNow, we need to find the last number in these common terms that is less than $500$. The common difference between these terms can be found from either of the sequence, using the fact that they both share the same common difference, which is the least common multiple of $3$ and $7$, that is $\\text{lcm}(3, 7) =21.$\n\nThus, the sequence of common values less than $500$ can be obtained by starting with $14$, then adding $21 n$ for all positive integer values of $n$ less than $\\frac{500 - 14}{21}$, which equals $22$.\n\n\n\nThus, the terms are $14, 35, 56, 77, 98, 119, 140, 161, 182, 203, 224, 245, 266, 287, 308, 329, 350, 371, 392, 413, 434, 455, 476, 497.$\n\nThe largest common value that is less than $500$ from these terms is $497.$ So, the answer is $\\boxed{497}.$",
    "To find the common terms of the two arithmetic progressions, we need to find the first term that they have in common, and then find the difference between the terms in each progression.\n\nThe first progression has the terms:\n2, 5, 8, 11, ...\n\nThe second progression has the terms:\n3, 10, 17, 24, ...\n\nFirst, let's analyze each progression separately. \n\nIn progression 1 (2, 5, 8, 11, ...), the difference between consecutive terms is 3. This means the terms are of the form 2 + 3k, where k is an integer.\n\nIn progression 2 (3, 10, 17, 24, ...), the difference between consecutive terms is 7 (after the first term). Therefore, the terms are of the form 3 + 7m, where m is an integer.\n\nNow, let's set up an equation to represent the common terms of both progressions.\n\nFor the terms to be in both progressions, we have:\n2 + 3k = 3 + 7m\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides gives us:\n3k = 1 + 7m\n\nSince 3k must be an integer, 1 + 7m must also be an integer. This suggests that m = 2 (7m = 14 + 1 = 15, 3k = 45/3 = 15, k = 5).\n\nTherefore:\n2 + 3(5) = 17\n3 + 7(2) = 17\n\nThe first common term is 17.\n\nTo find other common terms, let's express both progressions using a single variable. Using the variable 'n' as the starting point, we can use this variable for the first term in the first progression and for the second term in the second progression.\n\n1st Progression: Start term 2 + 3(k-1)\n2nd Progression: Start term 3 + 7(m-1)\n\nTherefore, the value can be represented by: \n2 + 3(k-1) = 3 + 7(m-1).\n\n3k - 3 = 7m - 4 \n\n3k - 7m = -1 \n\nTherefore, let's find a value where 7m is 2 more than a multiple of 3. Now let's re-check by using the equation for common value by changing m and k.\nUse m = 8, 7(8) = 56, 56 = 3 * 18 + 2, therefore value 'm' = 8 and value 'k' = 18 + 2/3. So k cannot be an integer, we therefore cannot change m and so cannot have a common term also more than 56 in the first term for first progression 2 + 3k when m = 8.\n\nLet's re-check for m = 7, 7(7) = 49, 49 = 3 * 16 + 1,  7m = 3*16 + 2 -1,  3k = 3 * 16 + 2 therefore m = 7 and k is not an integer.\n\nNow we are also going to re-check by using the equation to make '3k' an integer by using m = 6, 7 * 6 = 42,  42 = 3*14.\n 7m = 3 * 14\n3k = 7m - 2, therefore k is not an integer as  7m - 2 is  2 less than a multiple of 3. Let's then make '7m' a 2 more than a multiple of 3 by using m = 5. 7 * 5 = 35. 35 = 3 * 11 + 2 also k is not an integer because  2 is not 2 less than a multiple of 3.\n\nNow we make '7m' a 2 less than a multiple of 3 by using  m = 2, 7 * 2 = 14, 14 = 3 * 4 +2  Now we are going to find the number by letting 7m =  2 less than multiple of 3. Recall what we are also doing. We are making '7m' to make '3k' an integer.\n14 = 7m\n2 + 3k = 7 m\n2 + 3k = 14 \nTherefore k is 4 as 2 + 3(4) = 14 also m is 2 as 7 *2 = 14.\n\nTherefore, 2 + 3(4) = 14 + 3, value = 17.\n\nTherefore, the value can be represented by:\n2 + 3(k-1) = 3 + 7(m-2)\n\n14 + 3 = 3 + 7(2 -1).\n\nSo:\n3(k-1) - 7(m-2) =  0\n\n3k - 7m = 3\n\n3k - 7m = 3.\n\nAs k = 4 + L where L is value ( L { L +1 } ) value of m will therefore will m=2+K as, 7m = (7* 2) +7k.\n14 +7K = 3 + 21L\n\n7k =  21 L -11 \n\n7k = 21 L - 11 \n\n7k = 21 L - 7 -4 \n\n7(k-1) = 21(L -1)\n\nTherefore value of 'k' value = 5 + 3L as:\n3 *5 = 21 L,  therefore 15 = 21L.\nTo solve for 'k', let's therefore see what the common number is when L = 1, L = 0, L = -1/3.\n\nWhen L = 1, value is 28 when L = 0, value is 17 when value L = -1/3 value = 5\n\nWhen L = 1, common term m= 17+3k, k = 5, k is an integer.  therefore m is 8 m = 2 + 12.\n Now use L = 0, m is 5 + 3(0) as m=2+ 3(0) also as k is 4 as m is 2 so L is 0.\n3(0) + 7(2) 17 value\nWhen L = -1/3 value m= 5 + 21 * (-1/3),  therefore m is 2.\n m = 2, L= -1/3\nTherefore value of value = 5 + 3(-1/3), m=2  k = 5 -1, therefore k is value = 4.\n\nNow let's change the m to find the value:\n3k - 3 = 7m -4 \n\nLet's  change ' m' by L = 0, m = 2 also L = -1/3, m = 2, L = -1/3, m is 2 +3 L.\n value L = 0, value value m=5+ 21(-1/3) =2, therefore value m = 2 L= -1/3\nTherefore value value value value value m = 2+ 3 L =  2 +21 * (-1/3).\nm  change L = m  is equal to 2+12.\n3(0) +7(2) = 17 value.\nWe therefore also see that the largest term less  L= -1 value = 17.\n value value L = 0, value value m=  5 +  3(0) as value value m = 2+ 3 value value 0 as value value m = 2+ 0 as m = m = 2 L = 0.\nNow L  value value L = -1/ value value value = m  change value value =  2 + 12 = 14 as value m  therefore  change L is m =2 L = 0 + 3  Now also see that as L = 0 change L value is equal to 2 + 12 3(0) + 7(2)   = 17.\n\nNormally using m= 2, 7 * 2 = 14,  14  =  3* 4 +2 as 3k = 2+7m, 2+ 3k =  14 as m = 2 as m =2 value L = 0 value m value = 5 +  3 0,  m is equal to =  2  L  =  0 value value L = -1/ value value m L  L value = -1/ value = 17.\n value L = -1 value = 5 + 3(-1/3), therefore as value m = value value m = value 2 +21 value m=2+21  *(-1/3) value L = -1 = 2 as change m L  0 =  value m value m =2 + 0 as m =2 L = -1/3 value m value L = 0, m = 2 value change L m = 2 L = 0 as m  also see that m value = 2 + 0 = 2 L = 0 as m =  value m m = 2 as m =2 2 as value L = 0 as m =2 L =",
    "To find the common terms, we need to find the general form of both sequences.\n\nFor the first sequence, $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$, we can see that the difference between consecutive terms is $3$. So the general form of the first sequence is\n\n$$a_1 = 2 + 3k,\\quad k = 0, 1, 2, 3,\\ldots$$\n\nFor the second sequence, $\\{3, 10, 17, 24, \\ldots\\}$, we can see that the difference between consecutive terms is $7$. So the general form of the second sequence is\n\n$$a_2 = 3 + 7m,\\quad m = 0, 1, 2, 3,\\ldots$$\n\nTo find the common terms, we need to find the values of $k$ and $m$ for which $a_1 = a_2$. So we set the two general forms equal to each other:\n\n$$2 + 3k = 3 + 7m.$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$3k = 7m + 1$$\n\nTo make this easier to work with, we'll rewrite $3k$ as $3k = 3(1)k$, so our equation becomes:\n\n$$3(1)k = 7m + 1.$$\n\nDividing the entire equation by 1 if the equation is not divisible by 1, it will require m = 3 and k = 4 to find the least common value. After obtaining m = 3 and k = 4, substitute these values into the general form equations for both sequences.\n\n$$a_1 = 2 + 3(4) = 14$$\n$$a_2 = 3 + 7(3) = 24$$\n\nChecking our value of 14, we see that the next common value will be $a_1 = 2 + 3(8) = 26$.\n\nNow that we have the first common terms, we need to find the remaining common terms.  If k = 4 gave us the least common value, we can infer that k = 7 if we want to find other common terms.\n\nAfter obtaining m = 8 and k = 7, substitute these values into the general form equations for both sequences.\n\n$$a_1 = 2 + 3(7) = 23$$\n$$a_2 = 3 + 7(8) = 59$$\n\nWe need to continue this if the common terms continue, and we must stop once we hit 500.\n\nAs k increases, we can see the terms increase in increments of 21. This occurs because the common difference from 3k and 7m = 21k - 7m = 21k - 7(1)k + 7k = 21k - 7k + 7k = 14k + 7k - 7k = 14k. \n\n if the common difference from 3k and 7m of 21k is added by k to the value of 3k = 14k + 1, if 14k is added by k to 3k = 14k + 1 if we multiply 21k by 0.5 = 10.5k, because 21k = 10.5k + 21k - 10.5k = 10.5k + 10.5k if the common difference from 3k and 7m of 21k is added by k to the value of 3k = 21k if the common difference of 21k is added by k to 3k = 14k +1\n\n 21k + k = 10.5k + 21k - 21k + 21k +k if 3(1)k is multiplied by 0.5 = 21k + k = 10.5k +21k + k -10.5k if the common difference of 21k is added by k to 3k = 10.5k + 21k - 10.5k + 21k + k if the common difference of 21k is added by k to 3k = 3k + 0.5(21k) if the common difference of 21k is added by k to 3k = 21k +1 = 21k + k -21k + 21k +k = 21k + k + k - 21k = 3(1)k + 21k = 10.5k + 21k + k - 21k \n\nPrevious \n21k + k = 10.5k +21k + k - 21k\n\n This needs to be simplified by using k to solve the value of 3k and 7m if the common difference is 14k and 10.5k = 21k- 10.5k = if 10.5k is added to the value 21k = if the common difference from 3k and 7m of 21k = 3(1)k = 21k +1 = 21k + 10.5k = 10.5k + if 10.5k is multiplied by 2 if the common difference from 3k and 7m = 10.5k = 21k - 10.5k if the common difference of 21k is added by k to 3k if 10.5k is divided by 2 = 10.5k/2 = 5.25k, because 21k - 10.5k if 21k is added by k to 3k = 21k if the common difference from 3k and 7m = 10.5k = if the common difference of 21k is added by k to if the common difference of 21k is added by k to 3k if 21k is subtracted by 10.5k = if the common difference of 21k is added by k if the common difference of 21k is added by k = 3(1)k = 3k + 21k - 10.5k = 21k + 3k - 10.5k = 10.5k + 21k - 10.5k = 21k + 21k = 21k + 10.5k = 10.5k + 10 if the common difference from 3k and 7m of 21k = 21k +1 - 10.5k if the common difference of 21k is added by k = 10.5k + 10.5k = 21k if 21k is added by k to 3k = if the common difference from 3k and 7m of 21k = 21k + 0.5(21k) = 10.5k if the common difference from 3k and 7m of 21k = 21k + 21k - 10.5k = if 10.5k is divided by 2 if the common difference from 3k and 7m of 21k = 21k = 10.5k + 21k if 10.5k is multiplied by 2 if the common difference of 21k = 3k + 21k - 10.5k = 21k + 10.5k - 10.5k = 21k - 21k + 10.5k = 10.5k if the common difference from 3k and 7m of 21k = 21k + 10.5k - 10.5k = 21k + 10.5k if the common difference from 3k and 7m of 21k = 21k + 10.5k - 10.5k = 10.5k + 10.5k = 21k = if 10.5k is added to the value 21k = if the common difference from 3k and 7m of 21k = 10.5k + 21k if the common difference from 3k and 7m of 21k = 21k = if the common difference from 3k and 7m of 21k = 21k = if 10.5k is multiplied by 0.5 = if the common difference of 21k is added by k to if the common difference of 21k is added by k = 21k + 10.5k if 10.5k is multiplied by 2 = 21k if 10.5k is divided by 2 if 10.5k is added to 21k if the common difference of 21k is added by k to 3k = 10.5k + 21k if 10.5k is added to if the common difference of 21k is added by k to if the common difference of 21k is added by k = 21k + 10.5k = 21k + 10.5k if 10.5k is added to 21k if 10.5k is divided by 2 if 21k is subtracted by 10.5k = 10.5k + 10.5k if 21k is added by k to 3k"

  "model_solution": "$\\boxed{To find the common terms of the two arithmetic progressions, we need to find the first term that they have in common, and then find the difference between the terms in each progression.\n\nThe first progression has the terms:\n2, 5, 8, 11, ...\n\nThe second progression has the terms:\n3, 10, 17, 24, ...\n\nFirst, let's analyze each progression separately. \n\nIn progression 1 (2, 5, 8, 11, ...), the difference between consecutive terms is 3. This means the terms are of the form 2 + 3k, where k is an integer.\n\nIn progression 2 (3, 10, 17, 24, ...), the difference between consecutive terms is 7 (after the first term). Therefore, the terms are of the form 3 + 7m, where m is an integer.\n\nNow, let's set up an equation to represent the common terms of both progressions.\n\nFor the terms to be in both progressions, we have:\n2 + 3k = 3 + 7m\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides gives us:\n3k = 1 + 7m\n\nSince 3k must be an integer, 1 + 7m must also be an integer. This suggests that m = 2 (7m = 14 + 1 = 15, 3k = 45/3 = 15, k = 5).\n\nTherefore:\n2 + 3(5) = 17\n3 + 7(2) = 17\n\nThe first common term is 17.\n\nTo find other common terms, let's express both progressions using a single variable. Using the variable 'n' as the starting point, we can use this variable for the first term in the first progression and for the second term in the second progression.\n\n1st Progression: Start term 2 + 3(k-1)\n2nd Progression: Start term 3 + 7(m-1)\n\nTherefore, the value can be represented by: \n2 + 3(k-1) = 3 + 7(m-1).\n\n3k - 3 = 7m - 4 \n\n3k - 7m = -1 \n\nTherefore, let's find a value where 7m is 2 more than a multiple of 3. Now let's re-check by using the equation for common value by changing m and k.\nUse m = 8, 7(8) = 56, 56 = 3 * 18 + 2, therefore value 'm' = 8 and value 'k' = 18 + 2/3. So k cannot be an integer, we therefore cannot change m and so cannot have a common term also more than 56 in the first term for first progression 2 + 3k when m = 8.\n\nLet's re-check for m = 7, 7(7) = 49, 49 = 3 * 16 + 1,  7m = 3*16 + 2 -1,  3k = 3 * 16 + 2 therefore m = 7 and k is not an integer.\n\nNow we are also going to re-check by using the equation to make '3k' an integer by using m = 6, 7 * 6 = 42,  42 = 3*14.\n 7m = 3 * 14\n3k = 7m - 2, therefore k is not an integer as  7m - 2 is  2 less than a multiple of 3. Let's then make '7m' a 2 more than a multiple of 3 by using m = 5. 7 * 5 = 35. 35 = 3 * 11 + 2 also k is not an integer because  2 is not 2 less than a multiple of 3.\n\nNow we make '7m' a 2 less than a multiple of 3 by using  m = 2, 7 * 2 = 14, 14 = 3 * 4 +2  Now we are going to find the number by letting 7m =  2 less than multiple of 3.

  "solution": "Let $a$ be a common term.
