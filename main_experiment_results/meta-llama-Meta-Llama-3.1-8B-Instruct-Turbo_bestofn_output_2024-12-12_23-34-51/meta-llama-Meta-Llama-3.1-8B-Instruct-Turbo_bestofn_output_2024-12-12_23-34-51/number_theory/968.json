    "Since each of the natural numbers $x$, $y$, and $z$ has exactly 3 natural-number factors, it implies that each of them is a square of a prime number. \n\nLet's assume $x = p^{2}$, $y = q^{2}$, and $z = r^{2}$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are distinct prime numbers.\n\nNow, we want to find the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$. \n\nWe know that $(p^{2})^{2} = p^{4}$, $(q^{2})^{3} = q^{6}$, and $(r^{2})^{4} = r^{8}$.\n\nUsing the rule for finding the number of factors of a number, we get: \n\nNumber of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ \n$= (4+1)(6+1)(8+1)$ \n$= 5 \\times 7 \\times 9$ \n$= 315$ \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{315}$.",

    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand that a natural number with three natural-number factors must be a square of a prime number. This is because if $p$ is a prime number and $p^2$ has exactly three factors ($1$, $p$, and $p^2$), then $p$ must be a prime number.\n\nSo, let's denote the prime factors of $x$, $y$, and $z$ as $p_x$, $p_y$, and $p_z$ respectively.\n\nThen, we have $x=p_x^2$, $y=p_y^2$, and $z=p_z^2$. \n\nNow, let's look at $x^2y^3z^4$:\n\n$x^2y^3z^4 = (p_x^2)^2 \\cdot (p_y^2)^3 \\cdot (p_z^2)^4$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we have:\n\n$x^2y^3z^4 = p_x^4 \\cdot p_y^6 \\cdot p_z^8$\n\nTo find the total number of factors of $x^2y^3z^4$, we need to consider the total number of ways to choose the powers of the prime factors $p_x$, $p_y$, and $p_z$. \n\nSince the powers can be chosen from $0$ to $4$ for $p_x$, $0$ to $6$ for $p_y$, and $0$ to $8$ for $p_z$, the total number of factors is given by the product of the number of choices for each prime factor:\n\n$(4+1)(6+1)(8+1) = 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 9$\n\nCalculating the product, we have:\n\n$5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 9 = 315$\n\nTherefore, the total number of factors of $x^2y^3z^4$ is $\\boxed{315}$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They arrive at the same answer, which is 315. However, Solution 1 is the most concise and directly addresses the problem.

  "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors.
