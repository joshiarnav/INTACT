    "To find the units digit of $F_{1000}$, we need to find the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}} + 1$. \n\nSince we know that the units digit of $2^n$ follows a cycle, as follows:\n\n- The units digit of $2^1$ is 2\n- The units digit of $2^2$ is 4\n- The units digit of $2^3$ is 8\n- The units digit of $2^4$ is 6\n- The units digit of $2^5$ is 2\n\nThe cycle repeats every 4 powers.\n\nNow, we apply this to $2^{2^{1000}}$. \n\n- $2^{1000}$ is divisible by 4, as it is an even power of 2, but it's more than just that \n  We have $2^{1000} \\equiv 0\\pmod{4}$. That is , $ 2^{1000}$ is $4k$, for some positive integer $k$.\n\n- Therefore, $2^{2^{1000}}\\equiv 2^{4k} \\equiv 6 \\pmod{10}.$ That means, the unit digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6.\n\nThus, we get that the units digit of $F_{1000}$ is $6+1 = \\boxed{7}$",
    "To find the units digit of $F_{1000}$, we need to find the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}} + 1$. \n\nWe know that the units digits of powers of 2 follow a cyclic pattern: $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, ...$. This pattern repeats every 4 powers. \n\nNow, to find the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$, we need to find the remainder when $2^{1000}$ is divided by 4.\n\nFor any power of 2, if the exponent is divisible by 4, then the remainder when the exponent is divided by 4 is 0. \n\nHowever, the rule applies every four powers of 2 starting from 1. Therefore, if the exponent of $2^{x}$ (With the $x$ being of the form of our 2 raised to the power of something)  is a power of 2 itself then the powers of 2 will result in our 4 spot of  the pattern so the rule will apply anyway. As our exponent is the power of 2 itself ($2^{1000}$) the units digit will always be the 4th number of our pattern which is 6.\n\nAfter we find the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$, which is 6, we need to add 1 to it.

    "To find the units digit of $F_{1000}$, we need to find the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}} + 1$. \n\nFirst, we need to observe the pattern of the units digits of $2^n$. \n\n- $2^1 = 2$, units digit: 2 \n- $2^2 = 4$, units digit: 4 \n- $2^3 = 8$, units digit: 8 \n- $2^4 = 16$, units digit: 6 \n- $2^5 = 32$, units digit: 2 \n\nWe notice that the units digit of $2^n$ repeats in a cycle of length 4: 2, 4, 8, 6. \n\nSince the power of 2 is now $2^{1000}$, we need to find the remainder when $2^{1000}$ is divided by 4 to determine the units digit. \n\nIn modular arithmetic, the remainder when dividing by 4 can be found by looking at the last two digits of the exponent. \n\nSince the last digit of $2^{1000}$ is 8, the remainder when $2^{1000}$ is divided by 4 is the same as the remainder when 0 is divided by 4, which is 0. \n\nHowever, there is an alternative perspective: As the cycle repeats, every 4th power of 2 yields a units digit of 6, and so we need to observe the powers of 2 with respect to a cycle with longer length. \n\nWith that alternative perspective in mind, to find the remainder when $2^{1000}$ is divided by 4 to determine the units digit, we need to observe $2^{1000}$ mod 4, and to find this remainder we can observe that  \n1000 mod 4 yields 0."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. However, Solution 1 is the most detailed and provides the most insight into the problem. It clearly explains why the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6 and how it follows from the properties of modular arithmetic.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "Let's first try to find the cycle of units digits of $2^n$, starting with $n=1$: $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $2^n$ is 4 digits long: 2, 4, 8, 6. To find the units digit of $2^n$, for any positive integer $n$, we simply need to find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 2, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 4, etc.) Since $2^{1000}\\div4=2^{998}$ without remainder, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6.
