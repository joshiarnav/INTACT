  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They all follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) and correctly evaluate the given expression. The final answer is consistently $\\boxed{124}$ across all three solutions.\n\nHowever, Solution 2 is the best solution because it explicitly mentions following the order of operations, which is a key concept in mathematics and a best practice for problem-solving. This clarity makes Solution 2 the most straightforward and easy to understand.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is: 2",
  "solution": "The order of operations says that we must do the multiplication before we do the addition.  We get \\begin{align*}3\\cdot 9&=27,\\end{align*}\\begin{align*}4\\cdot 10&=40,\\end{align*}\\begin{align*}11\\cdot 3=33,\\end{align*}and \\begin{align*}3\\cdot 8&=24.\\end{align*}Now, substituting back into the original equation and using the properties of addition we get \\begin{align*}3\\cdot 9+4\\cdot 10+11\\cdot 3+3\\cdot 8&=27+40+33+24 \\\\ &=27+33+40+24 \\\\ &=60+40+24 \\\\ &=100+24 \\\\ &=\\boxed{124}.\\end{align*}",
