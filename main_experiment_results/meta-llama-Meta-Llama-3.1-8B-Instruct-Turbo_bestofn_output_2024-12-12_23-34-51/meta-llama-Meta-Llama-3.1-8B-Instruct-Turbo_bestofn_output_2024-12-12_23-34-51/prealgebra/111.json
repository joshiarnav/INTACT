    "To find the value of $(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5$, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which is:\n\n1. Parentheses: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first.\n2. Exponents: Evaluate any exponential expressions next.\n3. Multiplication and Division: Evaluate any multiplication and division operations from left to right.\n4. Addition and Subtraction: Finally, evaluate any addition and subtraction operations from left to right.\n\nFor the given expression, we have:\n\n(1) Evaluate expressions inside parentheses:\n- Inside the parentheses we have $6 + 1 - 4$. \n- Evaluate this expression first. $6 + 1 = 7$, then $7 - 4 = 3$.\n- So, $(6 + 1 - 4) = 3$.\n\n(2) Replace the expression with its value in the original expression:\n$(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5$ becomes $(21 \\div 3) \\cdot 5$.\n\n(3) Perform multiplication and division operations from left to right:\n- Divide 21 by 3. $21 \\div 3 = 7$.\n- Multiply 7 by 5. $7 \\cdot 5 = 35$.\n\nSo, the value of $(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5$ is 35.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{35}$.",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They all follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) and arrive at the same final answer: 35.\n\nHowever, I would recommend Solution 1 as the best solution. It clearly explains the order of operations and breaks down the solution step by step, making it easy to follow and understand.\n\nSo, the best solution is: 1.",
  "solution": "Recall that expressions within parentheses should be done first. In the inner set of parentheses, we have $6+1-4=3.$ So, the outer set of parentheses can be rewritten as $21\\div3=7.$ Finally, \\[(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5=7\\cdot5=\\boxed{35}.\\]",
