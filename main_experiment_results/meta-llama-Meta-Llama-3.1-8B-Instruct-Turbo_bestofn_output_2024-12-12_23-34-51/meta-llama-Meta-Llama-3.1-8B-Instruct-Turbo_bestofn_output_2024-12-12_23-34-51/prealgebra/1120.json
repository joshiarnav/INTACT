    "To find the area of the shaded L-shaped region, we need to find the area of the large square with side length 4 and the area of the two smaller squares, and then subtract the sum of the two smaller squares' areas from the large square's area.\n\nFirst, the area of the large square is $4^2=16$.\n\nThe area of the square with a side length of 1 and positioned in the top right of the image is $1^2=1$.\n\nThe area of the square with a side length of 3 and positioned in the left and bottom of the image is $3^2=9$.\n\nThe total area of the two smaller squares is $1+9=10$.\n\nThe area of the shaded L-shaped region is the area of the large square minus the total area of the two smaller squares, which is $16-10=6$.\n\nTherefore, the area of the shaded L-shaped region is $\\boxed{6}$.",

    "The area of the shaded $\\text L$-shaped region is the area of the entire shaded region minus the area of the smaller shaded region (a small square of side length 1).\n\nTo calculate the area of the entire shaded region, we first need to find its total area and subtract the area of the three smaller shaded squares from it.\n\nThe entire shaded region is composed of two squares and an $\\text{L}$-shaped region, but it can also be thought of as being composed of four squares. \n\nConsider the bottom right square and the top right square - both these squares can be moved and put into the top left square where they will perfectly fit. A 1 by 3 square will be left, but it is not part of the shaded L - shaped region - and then the 4 by 4 square will also perfectly fit into the top left square. The 3 by 1 square and 1 by 1 square  - both fit into 1 by 1  square so it leaves us with 1 square of side length  3 where  -  part of the L -  shaped region and 1 by 1  square -  which is the L  -  shaped region.   By using the side length 3, 4, and 1, we can calculate the area of the L -  shaped   region. \n\nNow to calculate area, use  A  =   length  b   - width  -  so   A  =  (4   *  3)   - (1  *   1). \n\nThen we can  calculate the answer   A  =  12  - 1  =  11."
