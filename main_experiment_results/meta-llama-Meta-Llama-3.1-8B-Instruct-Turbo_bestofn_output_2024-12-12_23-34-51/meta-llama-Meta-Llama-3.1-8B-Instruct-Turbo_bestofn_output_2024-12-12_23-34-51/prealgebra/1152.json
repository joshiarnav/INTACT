    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Find the smallest prime numbers:\n   The smallest prime number is 2.\n   The second smallest prime number is also 3.\n\n2. Square the second smallest prime number:\n   Square of 3 is $3^2 = 9$.\n\n3. Cube the result:\n   Cube of 9 is $9^3 = 729$.\n\nTherefore, the cube of the square of the second smallest prime number is $\\boxed{729}$.",
    "To find the cube of the square of the second smallest prime number, we need to follow the steps below:\n\n1. Identify the first and second smallest prime numbers: \n   The first prime number is 2 and the second smallest prime number is 3.\n\n2. Square the second smallest prime number (3):\n   3^2 = 3 * 3 = 9\n\n3. Find the cube of the result (9):\n   9^3 = 9 * 9 * 9 = 729",
    "To find the cube of the square of the second smallest prime number, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the second smallest prime number. The smallest prime number is 2 and the second smallest prime number is 3.\n\n2. Calculate the square of the second smallest prime number. The square of 3 is \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n\n3. Calculate the cube of the result from step 2. The cube of 9 is \\(9^3 = 729\\).\n\nTherefore, the cube of the square of the second smallest prime number is \\(\\boxed{729}\\)."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. However, I would select Solution 2 as the best solution.\n\nSolution 2 is clear and concise in its explanation, and it uses simple arithmetic to demonstrate each step. It also uses a multiplication example in step 2 which makes it easier to understand the concept of squaring a number. Additionally, it uses a multiplication example in step 3 to demonstrate the cube of 9, which makes it easier to understand the concept of cubing a number.\n\n1.",
  "solution": "The second smallest prime number is 3 (preceded by 2). We have $(3^2)^3=3^6=\\boxed{729}$.",
