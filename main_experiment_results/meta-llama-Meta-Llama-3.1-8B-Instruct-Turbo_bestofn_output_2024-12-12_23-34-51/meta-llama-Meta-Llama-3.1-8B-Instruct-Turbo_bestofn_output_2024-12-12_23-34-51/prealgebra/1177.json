    "To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem, which is given by:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs of the right triangle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nWe are given that the length of the hypotenuse is 39 units. We can rewrite the Pythagorean Theorem as:\n\na^2 + b^2 = 39^2\na^2 + b^2 = 1521\n\nSince the lengths of the sides are integers, we can try to find two squares that add up to 1521.\n\nWe can start by finding the square of 39, which is:\n\n39^2 = 1521\n\nHowever, this means that the triangle would be a degenerate triangle with zero area (a line with length 39), which doesn't satisfy the conditions of the problem.\n\nLet's try to find the square of 39's factors.

    "To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle with legs of length 'a' and 'b', and hypotenuse of length 'c', the following equation holds:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\nGiven that the hypotenuse 'c' is 39, we have:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 39\u00b2\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1521\n\nNow, we're looking for integer length sides 'a' and 'b'.

To reduce the solution space, it is helpful to identify some of the nearest squares less than and greater than 1521.\n\nTo begin with the rationale, let's begin by thinking of some squares close to 1521.

    "To find the shorter leg of the right triangle with an integer length hypotenuse of 39 units, we need to use the Pythagorean Theorem. \n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle), and a and b are the other two sides. \n\nSince we are looking for the shorter leg, let's assume that the shorter leg is 'a' and the longer leg is 'b'. In this case, a < b. \n\nWe know that the length of the hypotenuse (c) is 39 units. Therefore, we can plug in this value along with 'a' and 'b' into the Pythagorean Theorem equation:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 39\u00b2\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1521\n\nNow, we need to find two perfect squares whose sum is 1521. It is difficult to guess the perfect squares directly. However, we can try to factor 1521 into two perfect squares, or we can try to find two perfect squares that add up to 1521.\n\n\nOn the other hand, we can find this using the Euclid's formula or its simplified version for the specific case that a < b < c where c is the hypotenuse of length c with c being an integer. We can find a set of integer values satisfying the Pythagorean theorem as follows: \n\na = m^2 - n^2 \nb = 2*m*n \nc = m^2 + n^2 \n\nwhere both m and n are positive integers, m > n > 0. \n\nWe can plug in a few integer values for 'c' to find the one that equals 39. \n\nSince the longest side c is 39, we can write the Pythagorean equation as:\nm * m + n * n = 39 * 39 / 2\n\n\nWe need to remember that m and n are both positive integers. Since we need to factor 1521 = 39\u00b2, let's try to find a factorization of 39\u00b2.\n\nWe know that 39^2 = 1521. To break it down, let's factor 1521 into its prime factors: 1521 = 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 7. It is difficult to factor 1521 with the usual Pythagorean method, however, Euclid's formula allows us to find the factors that are also integers easily. \n\nNow we can use Euclid's formula with m = 13 and n = 5 for an easier factorization that will make both 'a' and 'b' more straightforward. Let us see if it satisfies the equation c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, where c\u00b2 is 1521 (since c is 39). \n\nm = 13 \nn = 5 \n\nNow we can plug in the values for 'm' and 'n' in the simplified Euclid's formula as follows:\n \na = m^2 - n^2\nb = 2*m*n\nc = m^2 + n^2\n\nPlugging in the numbers for m and n:\n \na = 13\u00b2 - 5\u00b2\na = 169 - 25\na = 144\n\nb = 2*m*n\nb = 2*13*5\nb = 130\n\nc = m^2 + n^2\nc = 13\u00b2 + 5\u00b2\nc = 169 + 25\nc = 194\n\nWe were actually looking for a right triangle with an integer hypotenuse of 39 units, but 194 is not the square of 39. It turns out that m = 13 and n = 5 is not the right solution for a hypotenuse of 39. Let's consider other values of m and n. \n\nUsing the Euclid's formula again with a little bit of thinking and some different numbers that will make both 'a' and 'b' integers. We need m and n where the following conditions are satisfied:\n\nm\u00b2 + n\u00b2 = 39\u00b2 \n13 * 5 doesn't fit the condition (the previous values for 'm' and 'n' since 5 * 13 ^ 2 + 5 ^ 2 = 194 < 39^2) \n\nWe need m and n so that their squares add to 1521. So we try out a different set of numbers until we find the one that fits. Since 13 * 5 = 65, which is too large a value for n*m, we can consider something smaller, like the following: \n\na larger n * m value such as 19 * 2 = 38 is  too large because its square is larger than 13 * 2 = 26.\n\n\nOn the other hand, we can  now make an educated guess about a smaller n * m value: like 10 * 3 = 30 and use a number for m that could satisfy the constraints. Remember that m > n > 0, and m*n must be an integer value for n that is slightly larger than m will keep the value of m*n acceptable as well (m*n is just 10*3). Let us try the numbers m = 12 and n = 9. Plugging in the values for m and n in the simplified Euclid's formula as follows: \n\na = m^2 - n^2 \nb = 2*m*n \nc = m^2 + n^2 \n\nNow we can find the values for 'a', 'b', and 'c' using the following values of 'm' and 'n':\n\na = 12\u00b2 - 9\u00b2\na = 144 - 81\na = 63 \n\nb = 2*12*9\nb = 216 \n\n\nc = m\u00b2 + n\u00b2 \nc = 12\u00b2 + 9\u00b2 \nc = 144 + 81 \nc = 225\n\n\nIn the above calculation, we can see that the values of a and b are not what we are looking for since we are trying to find a right triangle with the hypotenuse being 39 units. So we plug in another value of n and m to satisfy the constraints and try another pair of (m,n) for a 39 unit long hypotenuse for an a * b * c set with exactly one solution for each Pythagorean triplet.\n\nPlugging in the numbers m = 16 and n = 3 for a * b * c with the constraint that c is 39 units for each Pythagorean triplet as an example of Pythagorean triplets here.\n\na = m\u00b2 - n\u00b2 \na = 16\u00b2 - 3\u00b2\na = 256 - 9\na = 247 \n\nb = 2*m*n \nb = 2 * 16 * 3\nb = 96 \n\n\nc = m\u00b2 + n\u00b2 \nc = 16\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 \nc = 256 + 9\nc = 265\n\n\nAgain, this pair is not correct since the hypotenuse is 265 and not 39.\n\n\nNow let's consider different values for 'm' and 'n'. We know that a and b should be positive integers.\n\n\nLet's check the next Pythagorean set for (m,n) to find the set with exactly one solution. Since 39 < 20^2, let's consider the m > 20 value instead of m < 20 with the previously seen Pythagorean numbers for m and n. In particular m = 29 and n = 2 for an example of Pythagorean triplets with exactly one solution, here for a right triangle with an integer length hypotenuse of 39 units.\n\nIn this way the following values of a, b, and c are: \n\na = m^2 - n^2 \na = 29^2 - 2^2 \na = 841 - 4\na = 837\n\n\nb = 2*m*n \nb = 2 * 29 * 2\nb = 116\n\n\nc = m^2 + n^2 \nc = 29^2 + 2^2\nc = 841 + 4\nc = 845\n\n\nc  is not the 39 that is required so these values are not solutions. Let us see another value for m."
