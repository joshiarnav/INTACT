    "To find the percentage of $x$ that is equal to $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$, we'll break it down step by step.\n\n1. First, we need to find $50\\%$ of $x$. \n   $50\\%$ of $x$ is calculated as $0.5x$.\n\n2. Next, we need to find $40\\%$ of the result we got from step 1, which is $0.5x$.\n   $40\\%$ of $0.5x$ is calculated as $0.4 * 0.5x = 0.2x$.\n\nSo, $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$ is equal to $0.2x$.\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage of $x$ that is equal to $0.2x$. Let's denote this percentage as $p$. Then, we can write the equation as $p\\% \\text{ of } x = 0.2x$.\n\nWe can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by $100$: $p / 100 = 0.2$.\n\nNow, we can solve for $p$: \n$p = 0.2 * 100$\n$p = 20\\%$.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of $x$ that is equal to $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$ is $\\boxed{20\\%}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage of x that is equal to 40% of 50% of x.\n\nStep 1: First, let's calculate 50% of x. 50% of x is (50/100)x = 0.5x.\n\nStep 2: Next, we'll find 40% of 0.5x, which is (40/100)(0.5x) = 0.2x.\n\nStep 3: Now, we need to express the question in terms of x: We're looking for the percentage of x that equals 0.2x.\n\nStep 4: Since we're looking for the percentage that equals 0.2x, we divide 0.2x by x: (0.2x/x).\n\nStep 5: Simplify the expression (0.2x/x) to find the decimal. Since x is in both the numerator and denominator, they cancel each other out, leaving us with 0.2.\n\nStep 6: Convert the decimal 0.2 to a percentage by multiplying it by 100: (0.2*100) = 20%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of x that is equal to 40% of 50% of x is 20%.",
    "To find the percentage, we first need to find 40% of 50% of x, and then set it equal to some unknown percentage of x.\n\nFirst, let's find 50% of x:\n50% of x = 0.5x\n\nNext, let's find 40% of the result:\n40% of 0.5x = 0.4 * 0.5x = 0.2x\n\nWe're told that this result (0.2x) is equal to some unknown percentage of x. Let's call this unknown percentage \"p\". Then, we can set up the equation:\n\npx = 0.2x\n\nNow, we need to divide both sides by x to solve for p:\np = 0.2\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100:\np = 0.2 * 100 = 20%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of x equal to 40% of 50% of x is 20%.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{20\\%}$."

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I found that all three solutions are correct.\n\nHowever, if I had to select the best solution based on clarity and conciseness, I would choose Solution 1. Solution 1 breaks down the problem step by step and provides clear explanations for each step. It also uses a consistent notation and uses multiplication to calculate the percentages, which makes it easier to follow.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "40 percent of 50 percent of $x$ is $.4(.5x))=.2x$, so $\\boxed{20}$ percent of $x$ is equal to the given value.",
