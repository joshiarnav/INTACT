    "We are given that the value of $z$ is 60.\n\nIt is also given that the value of $y$ is one-fifth the value of $z$. So we can write:\ny = (1/5) * z\ny = (1/5) * 60\ny = 12\n\nNow, we are also given that the value of $x$ is one-half the value of $y$.

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They all follow the same steps and arrive at the same conclusion: the value of $x$ is 6.\n\nHowever, if I had to choose the best solution, I would select Solution 1. The reason is that Solution 1 presents the steps in a more concise and clear manner, with each step being a single line. This makes it easier to follow and understand the solution. Additionally, Solution 1 uses a consistent and clear notation, which makes the solution more readable.",
