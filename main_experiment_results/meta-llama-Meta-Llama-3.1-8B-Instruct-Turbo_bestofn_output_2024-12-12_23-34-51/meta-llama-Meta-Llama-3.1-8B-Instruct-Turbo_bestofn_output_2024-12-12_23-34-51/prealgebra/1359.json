    "To find the least positive integer divisible by each of the first eight positive integers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), we will find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of these numbers.\n\nStep 1: The LCM of 1 and any number is the number itself. So, the LCM of 1, 2 is 2.\n\nStep 2: The LCM of 2, 3 is 6.\n\nStep 3: The LCM of 6, 4 is 12.\n\nStep 4: The LCM of 12, 5 is 60.\n\nStep 5: The LCM of 60, 6 is 60.\n\nStep 6: The LCM of 60, 7 is 420.\n\nStep 7: The LCM of 420, 8 is 840.\n\nSo, the least positive integer divisible by each of the first eight positive integers is 840.",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. However, I will analyze them to determine the best solution.\n\nSolution 1 is a straightforward approach that calculates the LCM step by step. However, it might not be the most efficient method, especially for larger numbers.\n\nSolution 2 and Solution 3 are more efficient approaches that use the prime factorization method to find the LCM. They both correctly identify the prime factors and their highest powers, and then calculate the LCM.\n\nBetween Solution 2 and Solution 3, Solution 3 is slightly more detailed and easier to follow. It breaks down each number into its prime factors and then clearly states the highest power of each prime factor.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 3.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 3",
