    "To compute $0.18\\div0.003$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. We can write the given numbers with the decimal points at the end, which makes it easier to divide:\n   $18 \\div 3.$\n\n2. Now, let's solve the division:\n   $18 \\div 3 = 6.$\n\n3. Therefore, the answer is: \n   $\\boxed{6}$",
    "To compute $0.18\\div0.003$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.
