    "To express the given complex fraction as a common fraction, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions in the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n- The common denominator for 5 and 4 is 20.\n- $\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2 \\times 4}{5 \\times 4} = \\frac{8}{20}$\n- $\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3 \\times 5}{4 \\times 5} = \\frac{15}{20}$\n\nNow, let's add the fractions in the numerator:\n- $\\frac{8}{20} + \\frac{15}{20} = \\frac{23}{20}$\n\nDenominator:\n- The common denominator for 9 and 6 is 18.\n- $\\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{4 \\times 2}{9 \\times 2} = \\frac{8}{18}$\n- $\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1 \\times 3}{6 \\times 3} = \\frac{3}{18}$\n\nNow, let's add the fractions in the denominator:\n- $\\frac{8}{18} + \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{11}{18}$\n\nNow that we have the simplified numerator and the denominator, we can substitute them back into the original expression:\n- $\\cfrac{ \\frac{23}{20} }{ \\frac{11}{18} }$\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we can divide the numerator by the denominator. In fraction form, division is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal of the divisor. Therefore:\n- $\\cfrac{ \\frac{23}{20} }{ \\frac{11}{18} } = \\frac{23}{20} \\times \\frac{18}{11}$\n\nNow, let's multiply the fractions together:\n- $\\frac{23}{20} \\times \\frac{18}{11} = \\frac{23 \\times 18}{20 \\times 11} = \\frac{414}{220}$\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2.\n- $\\frac{414}{220} = \\frac{414 \u00f7 2}{220 \u00f7 2} = \\frac{207}{110}$\n\nSo, the expression $\\cfrac{ \\frac{2}{5}+\\frac{3}{4} }{ \\frac{4}{9}+\\frac{1}{6}}$ can be expressed as a common fraction:\n- $\\boxed{\\frac{207}{110}}$",
