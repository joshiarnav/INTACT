    "To find the product of $\\frac{1}{5}$ and $\\frac{3}{7}$, we need to multiply the two fractions together.\n\nThe product of two fractions can be found by multiplying the numerators (the numbers on top) and the denominators (the numbers on the bottom) separately.\n\nIn this case, the numerators are 1 and 3, and the denominators are 5 and 7. \n\nMultiplying the numerators gives us: $1 \\times 3 = 3$\n\nMultiplying the denominators gives us: $5 \\times 7 = 35$\n\nSo, the product of $\\frac{1}{5}$ and $\\frac{3}{7}$ is $\\frac{3}{35}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{35}}$.",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct in terms of the final answer, which is $\\frac{3}{35}$. However, I will analyze each solution for clarity, coherence, and overall presentation.\n\nSolution 1 is clear and well-structured, but it has an unnecessary sentence about the product of two fractions. \n\nSolution 2 is concise and directly addresses the problem, but it lacks a brief explanation about why we multiply the numerators and denominators separately.\n\nSolution 3 is also concise, but it has a minor mistake in the sentence \"The numerator is obtained by multiplying:\" - it should be \"The product of the numerators is obtained by multiplying:\" for clarity.\n\nBoth Solutions 2 and 3 seem to be better than Solution 1 in terms of conciseness and clarity. However, Solution 2 is more straightforward and directly addresses the problem.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 2",
  "solution": "A product is what you get when you multiply things together. To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators together to get the new numerator. So, the numerator is $1\\times3=3$.\n\nThen, multiply the denominators together to get the new denominator. $5\\times7 = 35$. Therefore our answer is:  \\[\\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{35}}.\\]",
