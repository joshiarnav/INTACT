    "First, let's find the number of multiples of both 3 and 5 between 1 and 200.

    "To find the number of integers between 1 and 200 that are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7, let's break down the process step by step.\n\n1. **Find the number of multiples of both 3 and 5 (15) between 1 and 200:**\n\n   The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5 is 15. The multiples of 15 are 15, 30, 45, ..., 195. \n   To find the number of multiples of 15 between 1 and 200, we can use the formula:\n   (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1.\n   In this case, the last term is 195, the first term is 15, and the common difference is 15.\n   (195 - 15) / 15 + 1 = 180 / 15 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13.\n\n   So, there are 13 multiples of 15 between 1 and 200.\n\n2. **Find the number of multiples of both 3, 5, and 4 (60) between 1 and 200:** \n\n   The LCM of 3, 5, and 4 is 60. The multiples of 60 are 60, 120, 180.\n   We can use the formula:\n   (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1.\n   In this case, the last term is 180, the first term is 60, and the common difference is 60.\n   (180 - 60) / 60 + 1 = 120 / 60 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n   So, there are 3 multiples of 60 between 1 and 200.\n\n3. **Find the number of multiples of both 3, 5, and 7 (105) between 1 and 200:**\n\n   The LCM of 3, 5, and 7 is 105. The multiples of 105 are 105.\n   There is only 1 multiple of 105 between 1 and 200.\n\n4. **However, the list we are trying to eliminate are multiples of 4 or 7 with a LCM of 60 and factors of 105. I notice that if we use a common difference table with 60 we will miss 180 with factor 15. Therefore we need to eliminate the multiples of 60 and 105 using an Inclusion-Exclusion Principle.  Because 3 is already with 15 there is no need to directly use 3.  We can now use a table of multiples to determine which of these 3 numbers should be subtracted.**\n\n   To find the number of multiples of 60 and 105 that should be subtracted, we can use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:\n   Subtracted multiples 60 = multiples of 60 - multiples of 60 * 105\n   Subtracted multiples 60. Then we add back the multiples of 60 and 105 that have been subtracted more than once to get:\n   Subtracted multiples = multiples of 60 + multiples of 105 - multiples of 60 * 105.\n\n   Using the formula, we get:\n   Subtracted multiples = 3 + 1 - 1 = 3.\n\n   But, there is the matter of multiples of 60 and 105 that should have been subtracted more than once. We already found that there were 2 multiples of 60. We need to exclude the multiples of 60 that also have a factor of 105 to avoid double-subtraction.\n\n   There is 1 multiple of 60 that also has a factor of 105 (180). We need to add back the multiples of 60 and 105 that have been subtracted more than once:\n   Subtracted multiples = 3 + (60 * 105 - 60) - 105\n   Subtracted multiples = 3 + (63 - 60) - 105\n   Subtracted multiples = 3 + 3 - 105\n   Subtracted multiples = 6 - 105\n   Since 105 is a bit larger than 6 we can treat this as 6.\n\n   Subtracted multiples = 6.\n\n5. **Find the number of integers between 1 and 200 that are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7:**\n\n   We start with the number of multiples of 15 between 1 and 200, which is 13.\n   Then, we subtract the number of multiples of 60 and 105 that were subtracted more than once, which is 6.\n   So, the number of integers between 1 and 200 that are multiples of bothetween 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7 is:\n   13 - 6 = 7\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"

  "solution": "Integers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 must be multiples of 15.  We can start by listing the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200: $$15,30,45,60,75,90,105,120,135,150,165,180,195$$ Checking only the even numbers, we can eliminate those that are multiples of 4, leaving us with: $$15,30,45,75,90,105,135,150,165,195$$ Finally, we need to eliminate any remaining multiples of 7.  The only multiples of 7 we need to be concerned with are those ending in 5 or 0.  The only number on the list that is a multiple of 7 is 105.  Our final list is: $$15,30,45,75,90,135,150,165,195$$ This leaves us with $\\boxed{9}$ integers.",
