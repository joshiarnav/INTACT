    "Let's break down the information:\n\n1. Total slices = 12\n2. Slices with pepperoni = 6\n3. Slices with mushrooms = 10\n\nWe want to find the number of slices that have both pepperoni and mushrooms.\n\nLet's use a Venn diagram or set theory to analyze the situation:\n\n- The total number of slices with pepperoni (including those with both toppings) is 6.\n- The total number of slices with mushrooms (including those with both toppings) is 10.\n\nSince every slice has at least one topping, the total number of slices is the sum of the slices with pepperoni and the slices with mushrooms, minus the number of slices with both toppings (to avoid double-counting).\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\n6 (slices with pepperoni) + 10 (slices with mushrooms) - x (slices with both toppings) = 12 (total slices)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n16 - x = 12\n\nSubtract 16 from both sides:\n\n-x = -4\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nx = 4\n\nSo, there are 4 slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "To find the number of slices that have both pepperoni and mushrooms, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet's denote the total number of slices as T = 12, the number of slices with pepperoni as P = 6, the number of slices with mushrooms as M = 10, and the number of slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms as B (which we want to find).\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can write the following equation:\n\nT = P + M - B\n\nWe know that T = 12, P = 6, and M = 10. We can plug these values into the equation:\n\n12 = 6 + 10 - B\n12 = 16 - B\nB = 16 - 12\nB = 4\n\nTherefore, the number of slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. Total number of slices: 12\n2. Slices with pepperoni: 6\n3. Slices with mushrooms: 10\n\nSince every slice has at least one topping, the total number of slices with mushrooms is the sum of the slices with only mushrooms and the slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms. Let x be the number of slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms.\n\nWe know that the total number of slices with mushrooms is 10, so the number of slices with only mushrooms is 10 - x.\n\nThe total number of slices with pepperoni is 6, so the number of slices with only pepperoni is 6 - x.\n\nTo find the total number of slices, we add the number of slices with only pepperoni, the number of slices with only mushrooms, and the number of slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms:\n\n(6 - x) + (10 - x) + x = 12\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(6 + 10) - x + x = 12\n\n16 = 12\n\nHowever, this is where we made a mistake. If we let (6 - x) be the slices with only pepperoni, we overlooked the fact that x itself cannot be the number of slices with only pepperoni.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem by using a different approach:\n\nWe know that the number of slices with only mushrooms is 10 - x, the number of slices with only pepperoni is 6 - x, and the total number of slices is 12.\n\nWe also know that every slice has at least one topping. This means that the total number of slices with either pepperoni, mushrooms, or both is 12. \n\nWe can represent this relationship using a Venn diagram with two overlapping circles (one for pepperoni and one for mushrooms). The area of intersection represents the number of slices with both toppings. \n\nBecause we know the total number of slices with either topping, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(Number of slices with pepperoni) + (Number of slices with mushrooms) - (Number of slices with both) = (Total number of slices)\n\n6 + 10 - x = 12\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n16 - x = 12\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\n-x = -4\nx = 4\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{4}$."

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I found that all three solutions arrive at the correct answer, which is 4 slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms.\n\nHowever, Solution 1 provides a clear and concise explanation of the problem using a Venn diagram and set theory. It also avoids the mistake made in Solution 3, where the variable x is incorrectly used to represent the number of slices with only pepperoni.\n\nSolution 2 is also correct, but it uses the principle of inclusion-exclusion without providing a clear explanation of why this principle is applicable to the problem.\n\nSolution 3 provides a step-by-step breakdown of the problem, but it makes a mistake in its initial approach, which is later corrected.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1.",
  "solution": "There are 12 total slices, and 6 of them have pepperoni and 10 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number of the slices that have both toppings, so there are $6-n$ with just pepperoni and $10-n$ with just mushrooms.  Since every slice has at least one topping, and there are 12 slices, we must have $(6-n) + (10-n) + n = 12$, which gives $n=\\boxed{4}$.",
