    "To find the three different positive integers whose product is $7^3$, we first need to find the prime factorization of $7^3$. \n\n$7^3 = 7 * 7 * 7$\n\nSince it is already in its prime factorization form, the three different integers are 1, 7, and $7^2$ (or 49). \n\nNow, let's find their sum. \n\nSum = 1 + 7 + 49\nSum = 57\n\nThe sum of the three integers is $\\boxed{57}$.",

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I would say that Solution 1 is the best.\n\nSolution 1 is concise and directly addresses the problem. It correctly identifies the prime factorization of $7^3$ and finds the three different integers as 1, 7, and 49. The solution then calculates the sum of these integers correctly.\n\nSolution 2 tries to break down the problem into finding the prime factors and then finding three different integers. However, it gets bogged down in unnecessary details and doesn't provide a clear solution.\n\nSolution 3 also tries to find the prime factors, but it incorrectly assumes that the three integers must be the prime factors themselves. It fails to consider the fact that the product of the three integers is $7^3$, which allows for other combinations, such as 1, 7, and 49.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "All three integers must be divisors of $7^3$.  The only divisors of $7^3$ are $7^0$, $7^1$, $7^2$, $7^3$.  We have $7^3=7^0\\times7^1\\times7^2$. Thus our answer is $7^0+7^1+7^2=1+7+49=\\boxed{57}$.",
