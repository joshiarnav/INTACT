    "To find the value of $a$, let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Angela has $a$ marbles.\n2. Brian has twice as many marbles as Angela, which is $2a$.\n3. Caden has three times as many marbles as Brian, which is $3 \\times 2a = 6a$.\n4. Daryl has five times the number of marbles as Caden, which is $5 \\times 6a = 30a$.\n5. The total number of marbles is 78, which is the sum of Angela's, Brian's, Caden's, and Daryl's marbles.\n6. So, we can set up the equation: $a + 2a + 6a + 30a = 78$.\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation:\n$a + 2a + 6a + 30a = 39a$\n\nNow we have: \n$39a = 78$\n\nTo find the value of $a$, we need to divide both sides by 39:\n$a = \\frac{78}{39}$\n\n$a = 2$\n\nSo, Angela has 2 marbles. \nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They all arrive at the same conclusion, which is that Angela has 2 marbles.\n\nHowever, Solution 1 is slightly more detailed in its explanation and simplification of the equation. It explicitly states the equation as $a + 2a + 6a + 30a = 39a$ and then simplifies it, making it easier to follow.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is:\n\n1",
