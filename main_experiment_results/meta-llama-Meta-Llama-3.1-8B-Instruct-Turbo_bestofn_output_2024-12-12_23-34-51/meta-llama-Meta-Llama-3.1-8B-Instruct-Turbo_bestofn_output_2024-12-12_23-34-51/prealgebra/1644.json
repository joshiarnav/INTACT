    "To solve this problem, we can start by using the information that $\\overline{AB} \\parallel \\overline{CD}$ and that $\\angle AXE$ is $108^\\circ$ less than 3 times $\\angle CYX$.\n\nSince $\\overline{AB} \\parallel \\overline{CD}$, we know that the alternate interior angles are congruent. So, $\\angle AXB = \\angle CDX = \\angle CYX$.\n\nThe problem tells us that $\\angle AXE$ is $108^\\circ$ less than 3 times $\\angle CYX$. We know that $\\angle AXE = \\angle AXY + \\angle YXE$ and that $\\angle YXE = \\angle CYX$, since they are vertical angles. Also, we have $\\angle AXY = \\angle BXY$. \n\nWe are given that $\\angle AXE$ is $108^\\circ$ less than 3 times $\\angle CYX$, so $\\angle AXE = 3\\angle CYX - 108^\\circ$. But $\\angle AXE = \\angle CYX + \\angle AXY$, and $\\angle AXY = \\angle BXY$. \n\nNow let's express the given condition $\\angle AXE = 3\\angle CYX - 108^\\circ$ using $\\angle CYX$ and $\\angle BXY$. As $\\angle AXE = \\angle CYX + \\angle BXY$, then we can write $3\\angle CYX - 108^\\circ = \\angle CYX + \\angle BXY$.\n\nWe need to use the fact that the sum of angles in the triangle $\\triangle EXY$ is $180^\\circ$. That means that $\\angle EXY$ can be expressed as $180^\\circ - \\angle CYX - \\angle BXY$.\n\nNow let's calculate $\\angle BXY$. We know that $\\angle EXY = \\angle CYX + \\angle BXY$. But we also know that $\\angle EXY = \\angle AXE - \\angle CYX$. Consequently, we can write the equation $\\angle AXE - \\angle CYX = \\angle CYX + \\angle BXY$.\n\nTherefore, $\\angle CYX + \\angle BXY = 3\\angle CYX - 108^\\circ$. The last step would be to solve this equation for $\\angle BXY$ which we should include in a simple boxed format, below.",
    "To find $\\angle BXY$, we need to first use the properties of parallel lines and transversals. Since $\\overline{AB}\\parallel \\overline{CD}$, corresponding angles are equal.\n\nTherefore, $\\angle AXE = \\angle CXY$.\n\nWe are given that $\\angle AXE$ is $108^\\circ$ less than 3 times $\\angle CYX$. This can be represented as:\n\n$\\angle AXE = 3 \\times \\angle CYX - 108^\\circ$\n\nAlso, since $\\overline{AB}\\parallel \\overline{CD}$, the alternate interior angles $\\angle AXY$ and $\\angle CXY$ are congruent. However, for now, we want to consider that corresponding angles $\\angle AXE$ and $\\angle CYX$ are equal. \n\nSo, let's assume that $\\angle AXE = x$ and $\\angle CYX = y$. Then we have from the initial equation,\n\n$\\angle AXE = 3x - 108^\\circ$ and $\\angle CYX = y$, where $x=y$.\n\nBut now, since alternate interior angles are congruent in a parallel line cut by a transversal,\n$\\angle AXY$ = $\\angle CXY$, now let's denote them both as $ \\angle CXY$.\n\n$\\angle CYX$ and other alternate of $\\angle CYX$  is congruent to another with different names $\\angle AXY$ but there's what we were trying to state is actually with another name, \n $\\angle AXY$=$\\angle CXY$ =$ \\angle BXY$ as from diagram.",
    "Since $\\overline{AB} \\parallel \\overline{CD}$, this implies $\\angle CYX = \\angle BXY$. Also, since $\\angle AXE = \\angle BXY + \\angle BYX$ and these three angles are supplementary (we could see that if we extend AB, CD, or bring in an angle that makes those other two constraining lines parallel), we have the equation\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\angle BXY + \\angle BYX + \\angle BXY & = 180^\\circ\\\\\n2\\angle BXY + \\angle BYX & = 180^\\circ\\\\\n2\\angle BXY + 180^\\circ - \\angle BXY & = 180^\\circ\\\\\n\\angle BXY & = 60^\\circ.\n\\end{align*}This implies that $\\angle CYX$ is also $60^\\circ$.  Next, since $AX\\parallel CD$, this means that $\\angle CXE$ is also supplementary to $\\angle CYX$, which is $180^\\circ - \\angle CYX$. (Also, the $\\angle CXE$ will equal $\\angle BYX$ in our equation as $\\overline{AX}$ is parallel to $\\overline{CD}$ and that will position $\\overline{BY}$ position in relation to $\\overline{CX}$ as position position the position position position position position position position position position position position position in relation to  is $\\angle EYX$ must equal that will be same as by relation $\\angle BYX$ is $\\angle EYX$. This is basically explained in an example ($\\angle BXE = \\angle CYE$) )\n\nFrom the problem we get \n$\\angle EYX + \\angle BYX = 180^\\circ + 60^\\circ$ or $\\angle EYX + \\angle BYX = 240^\\circ$. We know that $\\angle EYX$ will be $\\angle BXY + \\angle BYX$ meaning $3\\angle BXY$ or $3 * 60^\\circ$ that is $180^\\circ$. That is added up to the 60 from before meaning  $\\angle BXY + \\angle EYX + \\angle BYX = 180^\\circ + 180^\\circ$. Now since $\\overline{XY}$ is a bisector for those two angles  meaning their sum is the same as 180 degrees. Meaning that we can state following equation and will justify $\\angle EYX$ will be $\\angle BXY$   ($\\angle BYX = 180^\\circ - \\angle BXY = 180^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 120^\\circ$)."
