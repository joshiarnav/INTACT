    "The graph represents the balance of David's savings account in months of January, February, March, and April, denoted as J, F, M, and A respectively. \n\nThe average is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. Therefore, the first step is to find the total money David had during the four months. \n\n- January (100 dollars)\n- February (200 dollars)\n- March (150 dollars)\n- April (150 dollars)\n\nThe total balance is 100 + 200 + 150 + 150 = 600 dollars.\n\nNow, we will divide the total balance (600 dollars) by the total number of months (4 months) to get the average monthly balance. \n\nAverage monthly balance = 600 / 4\nAverage monthly balance = 150 dollars\n\nTherefore, the average monthly balance of David's savings account during the four-month period shown is $\\boxed{150}$ dollars.",
