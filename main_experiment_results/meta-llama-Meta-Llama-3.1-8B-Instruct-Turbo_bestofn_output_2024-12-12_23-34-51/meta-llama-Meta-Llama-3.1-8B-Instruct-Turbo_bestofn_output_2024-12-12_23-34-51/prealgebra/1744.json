    "To find the value of $\\frac{~\\frac{2}{5}~}{\\frac{3}{7}}$, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS) and the rules for dividing fractions.\n\nStep 1: When we divide one fraction by another, we can simply invert the second fraction (i.e., flip the numerator and denominator) and then multiply the first fraction by this inverted fraction.\n\nStep 2: Inverting the second fraction, we get $\\frac{3}{7} \\rightarrow \\frac{7}{3}$. Now, our expression becomes $\\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{7}{3}$.\n\nStep 3: To multiply fractions, we simply multiply the numerators (2 and 7) and multiply the denominators (5 and 3).\n\n$\\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{2 \\times 7}{5 \\times 3} = \\frac{14}{15}$\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the value of $\\frac{~\\frac{2}{5}~}{\\frac{3}{7}}$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{14}{15}}$.",

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I can confirm that all three solutions are correct. However, I will select the best solution based on clarity, conciseness, and adherence to mathematical conventions.\n\nThe best solution is Solution 1. It clearly explains the process of dividing fractions by inverting the second fraction and then multiplying the first fraction by this inverted fraction. The steps are well-organized, and the language is easy to understand. This solution also explicitly mentions the order of operations (PEMDAS), which is essential for following mathematical conventions.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is: 1",
