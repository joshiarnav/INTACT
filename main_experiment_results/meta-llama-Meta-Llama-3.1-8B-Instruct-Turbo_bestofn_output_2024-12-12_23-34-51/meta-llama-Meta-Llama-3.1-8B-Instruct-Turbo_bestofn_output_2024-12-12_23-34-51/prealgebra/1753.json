    "We are given that angle EAB is a right angle, and BE = 9 units. \n\nTo find the area of square ABCD, we need to find the length of AB. Let's call the length of AB as x. Since BE = 9 is the hypotenuse of right-angled triangle ABE, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem. However, we do not know AG yet.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to find the length of AB directly, we should first find the length of AE. Let's call the length of AE as y.\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that the square AEFG and square ABCD share the same height. The area of square ABCD would be x^2 and the area of square AEFG would be y^2.\n\nNow let's find the sum of the areas of the two squares.\n\nWe can now apply the Pythagorean theorem for right-angled triangle ABE. We have the following:\n\nAB^2 + BE^2 = AE^2\n\nx^2 + 9^2 = y^2\n\nx^2 + 81 = y^2\n\nNow let's substitute y^2 = x^2 + 81 into the sum of the areas.\n\nSum of areas = x^2 + y^2\n\nSum of areas = x^2 + (x^2 + 81)\n\nSum of areas = 2x^2 + 81\n\nSince we do not have the value of x, we cannot get a numerical value for the sum of the areas. However, we know that the sum of the areas of the two squares is related to the length of BE. \n\nNotice that square ABCD and square AEFG together form a square with side length 9. So, the area of the combined square is:\n\nArea of combined square = (side length)^2\n\nArea of combined square = 9^2\n\nArea of combined square = 81\n\nWe know that the sum of the areas of the two squares is equal to the area of the combined square.\n\nSum of areas = 2x^2 + 81\n\nArea of combined square = 81\n\nSince the two expressions are equal, we can equate them.\n\n2x^2 + 81 = 81\n\nNow let's simplify the equation.\n\n2x^2 = 0\n\nNow let's divide both sides by 2.\n\nx^2 = 0\n\nNow let's find the value of x.\n\nx = 0\n\nNow let's find the value of the sum of the areas.\n\nSum of areas = 2x^2 + 81\n\nSum of areas = 2(0)^2 + 81\n\nSum of areas = 0 + 81\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{81}$",

    "To find the sum of the areas of the two squares $ABCD$ and $AEFG$, we can start by identifying the relationship between the sides of the squares and the right angle $EAB$. We notice that the square $ABCD$ and the square $AEFG$ form right angles with each other, extending beyond the original right angle $EAB$. \n\nBy extending the lines from $B$ to $C$, and from $A$ to $F$ and $G$, we observe that the line from $A$ to $F$ has a length of $9$ units (the same as the length of $BE$) and the line from $A$ to $G$ also has a length of $9$ units. \n\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem, we know that for any right-angled triangle with side lengths $a$ and $b$, and hypotenuse length $c$, $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$. Since the right-angled triangle $ABE$ contains sides of length $AE$, $EB$, and $AB$, we can write the equation $AE^2 + EB^2 = AB^2$. \n\nNow, we want to calculate the sum of the areas of squares $ABCD$ and $AEFG$, which are $AB^2$ and $AE^2$ respectively. \n\nBy substituting $AE^2 + EB^2 = AB^2$ into our expression for the sum of the squares' areas, we get $AE^2 + EB^2 = AE^2 + AB^2$. \n\nSince the length of $EB$ is given to be 9, and given that the line from $A$ to $F$ has a length of 9 units, the length of $AB$ can be found through the use of the Pythagorean Theorem within triangle $CAB$: the sum of $AB^2$ and $AC^2$ will be $9^2$, so $AB^2 = 9^2 -AC^2$ \n\nBut the length of $AC$ is the same as the side length of square $ABCD$ which we have identified as the square on the side $AB$, which has the same value as side $AC$."
