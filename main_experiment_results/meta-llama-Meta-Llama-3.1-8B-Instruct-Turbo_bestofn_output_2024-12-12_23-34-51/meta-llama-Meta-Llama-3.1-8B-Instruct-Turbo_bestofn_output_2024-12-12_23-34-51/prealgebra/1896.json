    "To find the median value of the 59 salaries, we need to first arrange the salaries in order from lowest to highest.\n\nSince there are 37 Administrative Specialists with a salary of $\\$23{,}000$, it will be the middle value when the salaries are arranged in order.  Thus, the median salary is $\\$23{,}000$.",
    "To find the median salary, we need to first arrange the salaries in order from lowest to highest. Since there are 59 employees, the median will be the salary of the 30th employee (since 59 is an odd number, the median will be the middle value).\n\nFrom the table, we can see that the first 37 employees are Administrative Specialists with a salary of $23,000. Since 37 is less than 30, we do not need to consider any other positions.\n\nThe median value is the salary of the 30th employee, which will also be an Administrative Specialist. Therefore, the median value of the salaries is $\\boxed{\\$23,000}$.",
    "To find the median salary, we need to know the middle value in the ordered list of salaries. \n\nFirst, let's arrange the salaries in order from lowest to highest:\n\n- 37 employees with a salary of $\\$23{,}000$\n- 6 employees with a salary of $\\$50{,}000$ (since $\\$50{,}000$ is higher than $\\$23{,}000$ but lower than $\\$75{,}000$)\n- 10 employees with a salary of $\\$75{,}000$ (since $\\$75{,}000$ is higher than $\\$50{,}000$ but lower than $\\$90{,}000$)\n- 5 employees with a salary of $\\$90{,}000$\n- 1 employee with a salary of $\\$130{,}000$\n\nNow, since there are 59 employees in total, the median will be the salary of the 30th employee in the ordered list (since 59 is an odd number, the middle value will be the one in the middle position).\n\nLooking at the list, the first 37 employees have a salary of $\\$23{,}000$. This covers the first 37 positions, so the 30th employee will also have a salary of $\\$23{,}000$. Therefore, the median salary is $\\boxed{\\$23{,}000}$."

  "critique": "Solution 1 is incorrect because it assumes that the 37 Administrative Specialists are the middle values without considering the actual position of the median in the ordered list.\n\nSolution 2 is correct. It accurately determines the position of the median in the ordered list (the 30th employee) and identifies that the first 37 employees are Administrative Specialists with a salary of $23,000. Since 37 is less than 30, the 30th employee will also be an Administrative Specialist, making the median value $\\$23,000$.\n\nSolution 3 is also correct but provides more detailed information about the ordered list of salaries. However, it also reaches the same conclusion as Solution 2: the median salary is $\\$23,000$.\n\nBoth Solution 2 and Solution 3 are correct, but Solution 2 is more concise and straightforward in its explanation. Therefore, the best solution is Solution 2.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 2",
  "solution": "Since more than half the employees are Administrative Specialists, the median salary will be an administrative specialist, thus, $\\boxed{\\$23{,}000}$.",
