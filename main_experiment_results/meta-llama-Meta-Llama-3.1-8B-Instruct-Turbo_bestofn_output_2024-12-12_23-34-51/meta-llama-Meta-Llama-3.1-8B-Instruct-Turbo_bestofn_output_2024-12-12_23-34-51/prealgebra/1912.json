    "To find the arithmetic mean, we need to add all the expressions and then divide by the total number of expressions, which is 5.\n\nFirst, let's add the given expressions: \n- The sum of the first expression, $x + 8$, is $x + 8$.\n- The sum of the second expression, $15$, is $15$.\n- The sum of the third expression, $2x$, is $2x$.\n- The sum of the fourth expression, $13$, is $13$.\n- The sum of the fifth expression, $2x + 4$, is $2x + 4$.\n\nNow, we add these expression sums: \n$(x + 8) + 15 + 2x + 13 + (2x + 4) = x + 8 + 15 + 2x + 13 + 2x + 4$\n\nCombining like terms gives us: \n$x + 8 + 15 + 2x + 13 + 2x + 4 = x + 40 + 6x$\n\nSimplifying this gives us: \n$x + 6x + 40 = 7x + 40$\n\nNow, our equation for the sum is: \n$7x + 40$\n\nThe arithmetic mean of these expressions is given as 24, and we have a total of 5 expressions. Therefore, we divide the sum of these expressions by 5: \n\n$\\frac{7x + 40}{5} = 24$\n\nNow we solve for $x$: \n\n$\\frac{7x}{5} + \\frac{40}{5} = 24$\n\n$\\frac{7x}{5} + 8 = 24$\n\n$\\frac{7x}{5} = 24 - 8$\n\n$\\frac{7x}{5} = 16$\n\nTo get rid of the fraction, multiply both sides by 5: \n$7x = 16 \\times 5$\n \nSimplifying this gives us: \n$7x = 80$\n\nNow we divide both sides by $7$ to solve for $x$: \n$x = \\frac{80}{7}$\n\nSince we need the answer in a boxed format, we format our answer as: \n$\\boxed{\\frac{80}{7}}$",

  "solution": "Since the arithmetic mean of these expressions is 24, we can write the expression for the mean: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{(x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)}{5}&=24\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad (x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)&=5\\cdot 24\n\\end{align*}\n\nCombining like terms on the left, we find $5x+40=120$, so $5x=80$, from which we have $x=16$.
