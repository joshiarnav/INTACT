    "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest perfect square that is 10 more than a prime number and then subtract 10 from it.\n\nStep 1: Start with the smallest perfect squares and check if adding 10 to them results in a prime number.\n\n- For 1^2 = 1: 1 + 10 = 11 (prime)\nHowever, 11 - 10 = 1 which is neither prime nor fits the requirement to be $10$ less than a perfect square.\n\nTherefore we continue our analysis\n- For 2^2 = 4: 4 + 10 = 14 (not prime)\n- For 3^2 = 9: 9 + 10 = 19 (prime), 19 - 10 = 9, it does not fit the perfect square plus 10\n- For 4^2 = 16: 16 + 10 = 26 (not prime)\n- For 5^2 = 25: 25 + 10 = 35 (not prime)\n- For 6^2 = 36: 36 + 10 = 46 (not prime)\n- For 7^2 = 49: 49 + 10 = 59 (prime), 59 - 10 = 49. But 49 is a perfect square. But it still fits the requirements.\n\n\n\nThe smallest positive number that is prime and $10$ less than a perfect square is $\\boxed{59}$.",
    "To find the smallest positive number that is prime and 10 less than a perfect square, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the smallest perfect squares:\n   The sequence of perfect squares is 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, ...\n\n2. Subtract 10 from each of these perfect squares:\n   The sequence after subtracting 10 will be -9, -6, -1, 6, 15, 26, ...\n\n3. Check each of these numbers to see if they are prime:\n   We will only consider the positive numbers, and we can start checking for primality.\n   6 is divisible by 2 and 3, so it's not prime.\n   15 is divisible by 3 and 5, so it's not prime.\n   26 is divisible by 2 and 13, so it's not prime.\n\n4. Now, let's check the next perfect square, which is 49:\n   Subtracting 10 from 49 gives 39. We already checked numbers smaller than 39 and did not find the desired number.\n\n5. The next perfect square is 64:\n   Subtracting 10 from 64 gives 54. This is not the number we are looking for.\n\n6. The next perfect square is 81:\n   Subtracting 10 from 81 gives 71. This number is prime. We found the number in the list that is both prime and 10 less than a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive number that is prime and $10$ less than a perfect square is $\\boxed{71}$.",
    "To find the smallest positive number that is prime and $10$ less than a perfect square, we'll first need to identify perfect squares and then subtract $10$ from each to check for primes. \n\nStep 1: Start with the smallest perfect squares and subtract 10 from each to obtain a possible prime. Since we want to ensure our number is prime, we can begin with perfect squares of numbers greater than 1.\n\nStep 2:  The first few perfect squares greater than 1 are: $4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49$. Subtract 10 from each of these: \n- $4-10 = -6$\n- $9-10 = -1$\n- $16-10=6$\n- $25-10=15$\n- $36-10=26$\n- $49-10=39$\n\nStep 3: To be a prime number, the obtained number should have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. Non-prime (composite) numbers have more than two distinct divisors.\n\nStep 4: Among the results obtained from subtraction, only 6 is a potential candidate for being prime as well as being 10 less than a perfect square. However, 6  is a composite number and is not a prime.\n\nStep 5: We need to continue with the next possible perfect square which is 49 and continue searching for a number that meets both conditions.\n\nStep 6: Since the next perfect square number after 49 is 64 and 64-10 = 54 which is not a prime, we should check other perfect squares.\n\nStep 7: The next perfect square after 64 is 81. Therefore, 81-10 = 71.\n\nStep 8: Since 71 is a prime number (the only divisors of 71 are 1 and 71), our solution is 71.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{71}$"

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution for correctness, I found that Solution 2 and Solution 3 both arrive at the correct answer, which is 71. However, Solution 1 also arrives at the correct answer, but it incorrectly identifies 49 as a perfect square that meets the conditions.\n\nSolution 2 and Solution 3 are more systematic and thorough in their approach, while Solution 1 is more trial-and-error based. However, all three solutions arrive at the same correct answer.\n\nBetween Solution 2 and Solution 3, both are correct and systematic, but Solution 3 is more detailed and easier to follow.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 3. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 3",
