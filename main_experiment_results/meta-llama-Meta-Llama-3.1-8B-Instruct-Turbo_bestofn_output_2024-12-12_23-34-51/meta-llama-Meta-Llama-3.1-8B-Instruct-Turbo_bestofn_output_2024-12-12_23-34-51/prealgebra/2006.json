    "To simplify $\\sqrt{245}$, we need to find the prime factorization of $245$. \n\nFirst, let's break down $245$ into its factors:\n$245 = 5 \\times 49$\nSince $49 = 7 \\times 7$, \nwe can write $245 = 5 \\times 7 \\times 7$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite $\\sqrt{245}$ as $\\sqrt{5 \\times 7 \\times 7}$. \n\nUsing the property of square roots, we can separate the square root of each factor:\n$\\sqrt{5 \\times 7 \\times 7} = \\sqrt{5} \\times \\sqrt{7} \\times \\sqrt{7}$.\n\nSince $\\sqrt{7}$ appears twice, we can combine them into a single $\\sqrt{49}$:\n$\\sqrt{49} = 7$.\n\nSo, the simplified form is: \n$\\sqrt{245} = \\sqrt{5} \\times \\sqrt{7^2} = \\boxed{7\\sqrt{5}}$.",

    "To simplify $\\sqrt{245}$, let's break down the number into its prime factors.\n\nFirst, we can start by dividing 245 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. However, 245 is an odd number, so we move on to the next smallest prime number, 3. After that, we try 5, but it doesn't divide evenly either.\n\nNext, we try 7, which is a prime number. We find that 245 \u00f7 7 = 35. \n\nNow we have $\\sqrt{7 \\times 35}$. \n\nNext, we can simplify 35 by dividing it by 5 and then 7: 35 \u00f7 5 = 7. We already know that 7 is a factor of 35, and we also know that $\\sqrt{7} = \\sqrt{7}$. \n\nSo we can rewrite the expression as $\\sqrt{7 \\times 7 \\times 5}$. \n\nNow we can separate the prime factors as $\\sqrt{7^2 \\times 5}$. \n\nAccording to the square root property, $\\sqrt{x^2} = x$, so we have $\\sqrt{49 \\times 5}$. \n\nNow we can factor out the perfect square, 49, as $\\sqrt{(7^2) \\times 5} = 7\\sqrt{5}$. \n\nTherefore, $\\sqrt{245} = \\boxed{7\\sqrt{5}}$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and arrive at the same answer: $\\sqrt{245} = 7\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nHowever, Solution 1 is the most detailed and clear in its explanation, making it easier to follow and understand the steps involved in simplifying the square root.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: \n1",
  "solution": "We check what squares divide 245. None of the squares from $2^2$ to $6^2$ divides 245, but $7^2=49$ does. Dividing 245 by 49 gives 5, which has no square factors. So, $\\sqrt{245}=\\sqrt{49\\cdot5}=\\boxed{7\\sqrt{5}}$.",
