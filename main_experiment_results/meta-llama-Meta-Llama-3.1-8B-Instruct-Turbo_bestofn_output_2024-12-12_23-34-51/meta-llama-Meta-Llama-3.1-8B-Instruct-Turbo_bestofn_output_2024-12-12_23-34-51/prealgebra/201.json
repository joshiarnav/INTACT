    "To find the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Only one quarter of the earth's surface is not covered by bodies of water. This can be represented as $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n2. Only one half of the exposed land area is inhabitable for humans. This means that of the $\\frac{1}{4}$ land area, only half of it is inhabitable. To find this, we multiply $\\frac{1}{4}$ by $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n$\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$.",
