    "To find the greatest common multiple (GCM) of 8 and 12 less than 90, we first need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 12.\n\nThe multiples of 8 are: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96...\n\nThe multiples of 12 are: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96...\n\nTo find the LCM, we identify the smallest multiple that appears in both lists. In this case, the LCM of 8 and 12 is 24.\n\nSince we want the greatest common multiple less than 90, and 72 is the largest multiple of the LCM (24) that is less than 90, the greatest common multiple of 8 and 12 less than 90 is 72.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: $\\boxed{72}$",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct in their approach and arrive at the same answer, which is 72. However, Solution 2 is the most straightforward and efficient in its presentation.

  "solution": "Recall that the common multiples of a set of integers are precisely the multiples of the least common multiple of the set. In this case, the common multiples are integers of the form $24k$ (where $k$ is an integer), since 24 is the least common multiple of 8 and 12. Since $24(3)=72$ and $24(4)=96>90$, the greatest common multiple of 8 and 12 less than 90 is $\\boxed{72}$.",
