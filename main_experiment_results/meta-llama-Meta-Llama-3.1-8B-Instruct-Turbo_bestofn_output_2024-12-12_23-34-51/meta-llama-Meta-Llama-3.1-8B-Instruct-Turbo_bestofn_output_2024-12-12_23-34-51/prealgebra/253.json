  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They lead to the same conclusion that the value of y is 28.\n\nHowever, I would recommend Solution 1 as the best solution. It is concise and clearly presents the steps to solve the problem. The language used is straightforward, and the solution is easy to follow.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1.",
  "solution": "Substituting $-5$ for $x$ in the first equation, we have $(-5)^2 = y-3$.  So $25=y-3$. Adding $3$ to both sides, $y=\\boxed{28}$.",
