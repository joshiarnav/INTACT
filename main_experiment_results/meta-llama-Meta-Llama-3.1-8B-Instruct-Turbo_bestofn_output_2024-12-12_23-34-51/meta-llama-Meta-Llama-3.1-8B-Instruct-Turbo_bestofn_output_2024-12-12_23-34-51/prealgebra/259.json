    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The manager places $20\\%$ of the Mr. Slinkums on the shelves. This means $80\\%$ of the Mr. Slinkums are left in storage.\n2. We know that the number of Mr. Slinkums left in storage is 120.\n3. If $80\\%$ of the Mr. Slinkums equals 120, then $100\\%$ (the total number of Mr. Slinkums) will be $x$, such that $80\\% \\times x = 120$.\n4. To find the total number of Mr. Slinkums, we need to solve the equation: $0.8x = 120$.\n5. Divide both sides of the equation by 0.8 to find $x$: $x = 120/0.8$.\n6. Performing the division, we get: $x = 150$.\n\nTherefore, the order consisted of $\\boxed{150}$ Mr. Slinkums.",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, we know that the manager placed 20% of the Mr. Slinkums on the shelves, which means that 80% of the Mr. Slinkums were left in storage.\n\nLet's say the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order is 'x'. Then, the number of Mr. Slinkums left in storage is 80% of 'x', which we can represent as 0.8x.\n\nWe also know that the number of Mr. Slinkums left in storage is 120. So we can set up an equation:\n\n0.8x = 120\n\nTo solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.8:\n\nx = 120 / 0.8\nx = 150\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{150}$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They use the same approach and arrive at the same answer: 150 Mr. Slinkums in the order.\n\nHowever, Solution 1 is the most detailed and step-by-step explanation, making it easier to follow and understand.",
  "solution": "If $20\\%$ of the toys were put on the shelves, the $80\\%$ of the toys were left in storage.  Therefore, we are given $80\\% T=120$, where $T$ is the number of toys in the order.  Rewriting $80\\%$ as $\\frac{4}{5}$ and multiplying both sides by $\\frac{5}{4}$, we find that $T=120\\cdot\\frac{5}{4}=30\\cdot 5=\\boxed{150}$.",
