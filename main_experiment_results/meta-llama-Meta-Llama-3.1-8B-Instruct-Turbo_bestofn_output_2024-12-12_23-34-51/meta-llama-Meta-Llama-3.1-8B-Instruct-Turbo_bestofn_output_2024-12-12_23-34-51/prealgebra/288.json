    "Step 1: Identify the two largest one-digit primes. One-digit primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7.\n\nStep 2: Identify the largest two-digit prime. Two-digit primes range from 11 to 97. We can list and check the largest prime among them. The largest two-digit prime is 97.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the product of the two numbers found in the previous steps. Product = 5 * 7 * 97 = 3395.\n\nSo, the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime is 3395.",
    "To find the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime, we need to identify these numbers first.\n\nOne-digit primes are prime numbers that have a digit value of 1. Since the only such prime numbers are 2 and 5, these are the two largest one-digit primes.\n\nNext, let's list down the two-digit primes. These are prime numbers between 10 and 99. We have primes such as 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, etc. The largest two-digit prime among these is 97.\n\nNow we have the two largest one-digit primes: 2 and 5, and the largest two-digit prime: 97. To find their product, we multiply them:\n\nProduct = 2 * 5 * 97\n= 970\n\nSo, the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime is 970.\n\n$\\boxed{970}$",
    "To find the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the largest one-digit primes:**\n   One-digit primes are prime numbers less than 10. The prime numbers less than 10 are 2, 3, 5, 7. Among these, the two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7.\n\n2. **Find the largest two-digit prime:**\n   Two-digit primes are prime numbers between 10 and 99. The largest two-digit prime is 97.\n\n3. **Calculate the product:**\n   Now that we have the two largest one-digit primes (5, 7) and the largest two-digit prime (97), we multiply them together to get the product: \n   97 * 7 * 5 \n\nTo multiply these numbers, first multiply 7 * 5 and then multiply the result by 97. \n7 * 5 = 35 \n\nNow, multiply 97 by 35: \n97 * 35 = 3415 \n\nTherefore, the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime is \n$\\boxed{3415}$."
