  "critique": "All three solutions are correct in their approach and conclusion. However, Solution 1 and Solution 2 are more concise and directly address the problem, while Solution 3 provides a step-by-step breakdown of the process.\n\nBetween Solution 1 and Solution 2, Solution 2 is slightly more efficient as it directly mentions the method of factorization, which is a common approach to finding the GCF.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 2.",
  "solution": "$68=2^2\\cdot17$ and $92=2^2\\cdot23$. The only prime number that these two prime factorizations have in common is the number 2. If a number's prime factorization has a 2 raised to a power greater than 2, it will not be a factor of either of these numbers, so their GCF is $2^2=\\boxed{4}$.",
