    "To find the number of B's in a history class of 31 students, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Let the probability of earning a B be x. \n2. The probability of earning an A is .7x, and the probability of earning a C is 1.4x.\n3. We know that the sum of probabilities is 1, so .7x + x + 1.4x = 1.\n4. Combine like terms to get 3.1x = 1.\n5. Solve for x to get x = 1/3.1 = 0.3225806 (approximately).\n6. The probability of earning a B is approximately 0.3225806.\n7. To find the expected number of B's in a class of 31 students, multiply the probability of earning a B by the total number of students: 0.3225806 * 31 = 10.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{10}$.",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They arrive at the same answer, which is 10 B's in the class. However, Solution 2 is the most straightforward and easy to understand, especially for someone who may not be familiar with the concept of probability. It clearly explains the steps and the reasoning behind each step. \n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 2",
  "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of students who earn a B. Then we know that the number of students who get an A is $.7x$ and the number of students who earn a C is $1.4x$. Since every student in the class gets an A, B, or C and there are 31 students, this gives us the equation $.7x + x + 1.4x = 31 \\Rightarrow 3.1x = 31 \\Rightarrow x =\\boxed{10}$.",
