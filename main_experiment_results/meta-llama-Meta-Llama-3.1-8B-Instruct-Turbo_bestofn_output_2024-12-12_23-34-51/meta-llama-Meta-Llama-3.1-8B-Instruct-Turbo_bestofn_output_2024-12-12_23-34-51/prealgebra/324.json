    "To find the percentage of sales that were not pens or pencils, we need to find the total percentage of sales and subtract the sum of the percentages for pens and pencils.\n\nGiven:\n- Pens: 38%\n- Pencils: 35%\n\nFirst, let's find the sum of the percentages for pens and pencils:\n38% + 35% = 73%\n\nSince the total percentage of sales must add up to 100%, we can find the percentage of other items by subtracting 73% from 100%:\n100% - 73% = 27%\n\nTherefore, 27% of its sales were not pens or pencils.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{27\\%}$.",
    "To find the percent of sales that were not pens or pencils, we can start by adding up the percentages of pens and pencils sold.\n\nPen sales = 38%\nPencil sales = 35%\nTotal pen and pencil sales = 38 + 35 = 73%\n\nSince the total percentage of sales must add up to 100%, we can subtract the total percent of pen and pencil sales from 100% to get the percentage of other items sold.\n\nOther items = 100% - 73%\nOther items = 27%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of Quill and Scroll's sales that were not pens or pencils is 27%.",
