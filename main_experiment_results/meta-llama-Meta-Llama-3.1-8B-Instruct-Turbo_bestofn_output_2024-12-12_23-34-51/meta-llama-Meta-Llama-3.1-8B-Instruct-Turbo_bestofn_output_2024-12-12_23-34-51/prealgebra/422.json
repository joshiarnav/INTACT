    "To find the area of a circle in terms of $\\pi$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Recall the formula for the area of a circle: \n   Area = $\\pi * r^2$\n2. Since we're given the diameter (d), not the radius (r), we'll convert it. \n   The radius is half of the diameter: \n   r = d / 2\n3. Given that the diameter is 4 meters, we can now find the radius:\n   r = 4 / 2 = 2 meters\n4. Substitute the value of the radius into the area formula:\n   Area = $\\pi * (2)^2$\n5. Simplify the equation:\n   Area = $\\pi * 4$\n\nTherefore, the area of the circle in terms of $\\pi$ is: \n$\\boxed{4\\pi}$",
    "To find the area of a circle, we need to use the formula:\n\nArea = $\\pi$ * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle.\n\nSince we are given the diameter, which is 4 meters, we can find the radius by dividing the diameter by 2.\n\nRadius (r) = diameter / 2\n= 4 / 2\n= 2 meters\n\nNow that we know the radius, we can plug it into the formula to find the area.\n\nArea = $\\pi$ * r^2\n= $\\pi$ * (2)^2\n= $\\pi$ * 4\n= $\\boxed{4\\pi}$\n\nTherefore, the area of the circle is 4$\\pi$ square meters.",
    "To find the area of a circle, we first need to find its radius. The radius is half the length of the diameter. \n\nGiven the diameter of the circle is 4 meters, \n\nRadius = 4 / 2 = 2 meters.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius of the circle.\n\nSubstituting the value of r (which is 2 meters) into the formula gives us:\n\nA = \u03c0(2)\u00b2\nA = \u03c0 * 4\nA = 4\u03c0\n\nTherefore, the number of square meters in the area of the circle with a diameter of 4 meters is 4\u03c0."
