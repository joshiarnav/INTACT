    "To determine the distance Piravena travels for her complete trip, we need to consider the given cities and their distances. \n\nWe are given that city $A$ and city $C$ are 3000 km apart and city $A$ and city $B$ are 3250 km apart. Since the given cities form a right-angled triangle with city $C$ at the right angle, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from city $B$ to city $C$.\n\nLet's use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n$ (BC)^2 + (CA)^2 = (AB)^2$\n\n$ (BC)^2 + (3000)^2 = (3250)^2$\n\n$ (BC)^2 + 9000000 = 10562500$\n\n$ (BC)^2 = 10562500 - 9000000$\n\n$ (BC)^2 = 1562500$\n\n$ BC = \\sqrt{1562500}$\n\n$ BC = 1250$\n\nNow that we know the distances between each pair of cities, we can sum them up to find the total distance Piravena travels on her complete trip.\n\nThe total distance Piravena travels is the sum of the distances between city $A$ and city $B$, between city $B$ and city $C$, and between city $A$ and city $C$.\n\n$ Total\\ distance = AB + BC + CA$\n\n$ Total\\ distance = 3250 + 1250 + 3000$\n\n$ Total\\ distance = 7500$\n\n$\\boxed{7500}$",

    "To find the total distance traveled by Piravena, we first need to find the distance between $B$ and $C$.  Since we have a right-angled triangle with $A$, $B$, and $C$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem. Let $d_1$ denote the distance from $B$ to $C$, $d_2$ the distance from $A$ to $B$, and $d_3$ the distance from $C$ to $A$. These distances are already known from the diagram and we now have, $$d_2^2=d_3^2+d_1^2$$ Substituting the values we get $$3250^2=3000^2+d_1^2$$ $$10562500=9000000+d_1^2$$ $$d_1^2=10562500-9000000=1562500$$ $$d_1=\\sqrt{1562500}$$ $$d_1=1250 \\text{km}$$ The total distance traveled is now, $$d_2+d_1+d_3$$ These distances are 3250km, 1250 km, and 3000 km respectively. So, the total distance traveled is 3250 + 1250 + 3000, $$=7500 \\text{ km}$$ Thus, Piravena travels 7500 km."

  "critique": "All three solutions are mathematically correct and arrive at the same answer, which is 7500 km. \n\nHowever, Solution 1 is the most detailed and provides the most explanation for the steps taken to solve the problem.
