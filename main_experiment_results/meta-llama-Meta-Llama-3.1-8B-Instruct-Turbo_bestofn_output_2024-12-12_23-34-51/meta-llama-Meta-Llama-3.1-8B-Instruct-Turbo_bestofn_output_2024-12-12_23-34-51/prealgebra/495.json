    "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nGiven the equation: \n\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot T = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 90$\n\nFirst, let's simplify the left side of the equation: \n\n$\\frac{1}{14} \\cdot T$\n\nNext, let's simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n$\\frac{1}{15} \\cdot 90 = 6$\n\nNow the equation becomes:\n\n$\\frac{1}{14} \\cdot T = 6$\n\nTo find the value of $T$, we can multiply both sides by 14:\n\n$T = 6 \\cdot 14$\n\n$T = 84$\n\nSo, the value of $T$ is $\\boxed{84}$.",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and arrive at the same answer, which is T = 84. \n\nHowever, Solution 1 and Solution 3 are more concise and directly address the equation from the start, whereas Solution 2 introduces an intermediate variable 'x' and 'z' which can make the solution slightly more complex to follow.\n\nConsidering the clarity and directness of the approach, I would select Solution 1 as the best solution.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
