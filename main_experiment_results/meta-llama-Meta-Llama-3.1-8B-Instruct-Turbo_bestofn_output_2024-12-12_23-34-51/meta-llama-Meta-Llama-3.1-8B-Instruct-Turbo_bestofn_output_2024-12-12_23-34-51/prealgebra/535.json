    "To find the probability of a blue face facing up when the cube is rolled, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the total number of possible outcomes when the cube is rolled. A cube has 6 faces, so there are 6 possible outcomes.\n2. Determine the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of blue faces on the cube. We are given that the cube has 4 blue faces.\n3. Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nNow, let's do the math:\n\nTotal number of possible outcomes = 6\nNumber of favorable outcomes (blue faces) = 4\n\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\nProbability = 4/6\nProbability = 2/3\n\nSo, the probability that a blue face will be facing up when the cube is rolled is $\\boxed{2/3}$.",
    "To find the probability of a blue face facing up when the cube is rolled, we need to consider the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes.\n\n1. Total possible outcomes: When a cube is rolled, it can land on any of its 6 faces. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 6.\n2. Number of favorable outcomes: Since we have a cube with 4 blue faces, the number of favorable outcomes (i.e., blue faces that will be facing up) is 4.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\nProbability = 4 / 6\nProbability = 2 / 3\n\nSo, the probability that an initially described cube will roll a blue face up is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",

  "critique": "All three solutions are mathematically correct and yield the same result: 2/3. However, I would select Solution 1 as the best solution due to its clarity and organization of steps.\n\nSolution 1 clearly outlines the steps to follow in determining the probability, and it uses the most descriptive variable names (e.g., \"favorable outcomes\" instead of just \"blue faces\"). This makes the solution easier to understand and follow.\n\nTherefore, the index number (1 to 3) of the best solution is: 1.",
  "solution": "We have 6 equally likely outcomes, corresponding to the 6 faces of the cube.  4 of those 6 outcomes are successful ones (meaning a blue face is facing up).  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
