  "problem": "A zoo has a menagerie containing four pairs of different animals, one male and one female for each. The zookeeper wishes to feed the animals in a specific pattern: each time he feeds a single animal, the next one he feeds must be a different gender. If he starts by feeding the male giraffe, how many ways can he feed all the animals?",

    "To find the number of ways the zookeeper can feed the animals, we can break down the process step by step.\n\n1. The zookeeper starts by feeding the male giraffe. \n2. The next animal he feeds must be a female, so there are 4 female animals he can feed.\n3. After feeding the first female, he must feed a male, but there are only 3 male animals left to choose from (excluding the male giraffe).\n4. The next animal he feeds must be a female, so there are now 3 female animals left to choose from (excluding the first female).\n5. After feeding the second female, he must feed a male, so there are now 2 male animals left to choose from.\n6. The next animal he feeds must be a female, so there are 2 female animals left to choose from.\n7. After feeding the third female, he must feed a male, so there is now only 1 male animal left to choose from.\n8. Finally, he must feed the last female.\n\nNow, let's multiply the number of choices available at each step to find the total number of ways he can feed the animals: \n\n4 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 144.\n\nTherefore, the zookeeper can feed the animals in 144 different ways in the specified pattern.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{144}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. The zookeeper starts by feeding the male giraffe.

    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible ways the zookeeper can feed the animals, following the specified pattern.\n\nWe have four pairs of different animals, each with one male and one female. We are given that the zookeeper starts by feeding the male giraffe.\n\nLet's break down the process into steps:\n\n1. The zookeeper starts by feeding the male giraffe. This is the first male.\n2. Since the next animal must be a female, there are 4 possible choices for the next animal to be fed.\n3. After feeding the first female, the zookeeper must feed a male again. However, since one male (the giraffe) has already been fed, there are now only 3 males left to choose from.\n4. After feeding the second male, the zookeeper must feed a female. However, since one female has already been fed, there are now only 3 females left to choose from.\n5. This pattern continues in alternating genders, with 2 males, 2 females, 1 male, and 1 female remaining.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of ways the zookeeper can feed the animals:\n\n* Step 1: 1 choice (the giraffe)\n* Step 2: 4 choices\n* Step 3: 3 choices\n* Step 4: 3 choices\n* Step 5: 2 choices\n* Step 6: 2 choices\n\nSince the zookeeper must continue alternating genders until all animals have been fed, we can multiply the choices at each step: \n\n1 (for giraffe) \u00d7 4 (for first female) \u00d7 3 (for second male) \u00d7 3 (for second female) \u00d7 2 (for third male) \u00d7 2 (for third female) \u00d7 1 (for male) \u00d7 1 (for final female)\n\nThe total number of ways is: 1 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 = 144\n\nHowever, we must multiply this by 6, as we only calculated for the case where the zookeeper starts with the male giraffe. The male giraffe can be 'statically' chosen, forcing the female of the same species, and since we know there are '4'statically being chosen lets multiply this by 2 reflecting the position that holds which we started first to begin with male position."
