    "To find the sum of the prime factors of 91, we need to first factorize 91 into its prime factors.\n\n91 can be broken down as follows:\n- First, we check for divisibility by small prime numbers. It's divisible by 7 because 91 \u00f7 7 = 13.\n- Since both 7 and 13 are prime numbers, 91 can be expressed as 7 * 13.\n\nNow, we have the prime factors of 91 as 7 and 13. To find the sum, we add these prime factors together: \n7 + 13 = 20\n\nTherefore, the sum of the prime factors of 91 is 20, which can be expressed in the format:\n$\\boxed{20}$",
    "To find the sum of the prime factors of 91, we need to first find the prime factors. \n\nStep 1: Find the factors of 91.\n- The factors of 91 are 1, 7, 13, and 91.\n\nStep 2: Identify the prime factors.\n- A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In this case, 7 and 13 are prime numbers.\n\nStep 3: Find the sum of the prime factors.\n- The prime factors of 91 are 7 and 13.\n- The sum of the prime factors is 7 + 13 = 20.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the prime factors of 91 is $\\boxed{20}$.",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and lead to the same answer: 20.\n\nHowever, I would select Solution 1 as the best solution. Here's why:\n\n- Solution 1 is concise and directly addresses the problem. It starts by breaking down 91 into its prime factors, which is the most efficient way to find the sum of the prime factors.\n- Solution 1 is easy to follow and understands the concept of prime numbers and factors.\n- Solution 1 does not include unnecessary steps, making it more efficient and easier to read.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1.",
  "solution": "Since 91 is not divisible by the first three prime numbers, we try dividing $91\\div 7$.  We find a quotient of 13, so $91=7\\times 13$ and the sum of these prime factors is $7+13=\\boxed{20}$.",
