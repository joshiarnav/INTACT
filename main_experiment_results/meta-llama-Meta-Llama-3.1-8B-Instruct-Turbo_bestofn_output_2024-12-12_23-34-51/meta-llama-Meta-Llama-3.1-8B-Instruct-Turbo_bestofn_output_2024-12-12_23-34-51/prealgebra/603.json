    "To calculate the average speed, we need to know the total distance traveled and the total time taken.\n\nThe total distance is given as 160 miles (at 11 a.m) - 0 miles (at 6 a.m) = 160 miles.\n\nThe total time taken is 11 a.m - 6 a.m = 5 hours.\n\nAverage speed is calculated as total distance divided by total time.
