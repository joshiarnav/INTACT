    "To find the average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$, we add them and divide by 3. \n\nSo, the average is $\\frac{(x+6) + (6x+2) + (2x+7)}{3}$.\n\nGiven that the average is $4x-7$, we set up the equation:\n\n$\\frac{(x+6) + (6x+2) + (2x+7)}{3} = 4x - 7$\n\nNow, let's simplify the left-hand side of the equation by adding the terms in the numerator:\n\n$\\frac{9x + 15}{3} = 4x - 7$\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n\n$9x + 15 = 12x - 21$\n\nNow, let's isolate the variable $x$ by subtracting $9x$ from both sides of the equation:\n\n$15 = 3x - 21$\n\nAdding 21 to both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n$36 = 3x$\n\nNow, let's divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the value of $x$:\n\n$12 = x$\n\nSo, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "To find the average, we add up all the values and divide by the number of values. In this case, there are three values: $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$.\n\nLet's add these values up:\n(x + 6) + (6x + 2) + (2x + 7) = x + 6x + 2x + 6 + 2 + 7\n= 9x + 15\n\nNow, we need to divide the sum by 3 (the number of values). But we are given that the average of these values is $4x-7$. So, we set up the equation:\n\n(9x + 15) / 3 = 4x - 7\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 3:\n9x + 15 = 3(4x - 7)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n9x + 15 = 12x - 21\n\nNow, let's move the terms with $x$ to one side and the constants to the other side:\n12x - 9x = 15 + 21\n\nCombine like terms:\n3x = 36\n\nNow, let's divide both sides by 3:\nx = 36 / 3\nx = 12\n\nSo, the value of x is $\\boxed{12}$.",

  "solution": "The average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $\\dfrac{1}{3}((x+6)+(6x+2)+(2x+7))$. Simplifying this expression gives $\\dfrac{1}{3}(9x+15)=3x+5$. We know the average is also $4x-7$, so $3x+5=4x-7$. Subtracting $3x-7$ from both sides of this equation gives $x=\\boxed{12}$.",
