    "To find the total amount of money shared, we need to first determine the ratio of each person's portion. \n\nGiven the ratio of Amanda, Ben, and Carlos is 1:2:7, respectively. \n\nIf Amanda's portion is $\\$$20, and her portion is represented by 1 in the ratio, we can determine the value of the ratio by setting up a proportion.\n\nLet's set up the proportion:\n\\[1x: 2x: 7x = 20\\]\nSince Amanda's portion is 1x, and it equals $\\$$20, we can solve for x:\n\\[1x = 20\\]\n\\[x = 20\\]\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find Ben's and Carlos's portions.\nBen's portion is represented by 2x, so we multiply 2 by x to get the value.\n\\[2x = 2 \\times 20 = 40\\]\n\nCarlos's portion is represented by 7x, so we multiply 7 by x to get the value.\n\\[7x = 7 \\times 20 = 140\\]\n\nNow, let's add the portions to find the total amount of money shared:\n\\[20 + 40 + 140 = 200\\]\n\nThe total amount of money shared is $\\boxed{200}$.",

    "To find the total amount of money shared, we first need to find the value of one part of the ratio. \n\nGiven that Amanda's portion is $20 and it represents one part of the ratio, we can set up an equation to find the value of one part.\n\nLet the value of one part be x.\nSince the ratio is 1:2:7, we can set up the following equation:\n1x + 2x + 7x = 20 (This is based on the fact that Amanda's portion is 1 part, Ben's portion is 2 parts, and Carlos's portion is 7 parts)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n10x = 20\n\nDividing both sides by 10:\nx = 2\n\nNow that we have the value of one part (x = 2), we can find the total amount of money shared. We add the total parts together which is 1+2+7 = 10 parts.\n\n Multiply the value of one part (x = 2) by the total number of parts (10):\nTotal amount of money shared = 10x\nTotal amount of money shared = 10 * 2\nTotal amount of money shared = 20\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$"

  "critique": "Solution 1 and Solution 2 are correct. They both follow the same steps and arrive at the same answer, which is $\\boxed{200}$.\n\nSolution 3 is incorrect. The equation 1x + 2x + 7x = 20 is not based on the fact that Amanda's portion is 1 part, Ben's portion is 2 parts, and Carlos's portion is 7 parts. Instead, it implies that Amanda's portion is 1 part, Ben's portion is 2 parts, and Carlos's portion is 7 parts of the same unit, but the total number of parts (1+2+7) is actually 10, not 1, 2, and 7. This leads to a calculation error, resulting in an incorrect answer of $\\boxed{20}$.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1 or Solution 2. Since they are identical, I will choose Solution 1 as the best solution.\n\nThe best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "We multiply each part of the ratio $1:2:7$ by 20 to make Amanda's part equal 20, and we have \\[1:2:7 = 1\\cdot 20:2\\cdot 20 :7\\cdot 20 = 20:40:140.\\] This means that  Ben's share is $2\\times 20 = 40$ dollars and Carlos's share is $7\\times 20=140$ dollars.  Therefore, the total amount of money shared is $20+40+140=\\boxed{200}$ dollars.",
