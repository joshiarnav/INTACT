    "To find the value of $x$, let's consider the given conditions one by one.\n\n1. $x$ is a positive multiple of 8:\n   This means $x$ can be represented as $8n$, where $n$ is a positive integer.\n\n2. $x^2 > 100$:\n   Taking the square root of both sides gives us $x > 10$ or $x < -10$. Since $x$ is positive, we consider $x > 10$.\n\n3. $x < 20$:\n   This condition further limits the possible values of $x$.\n\nConsidering condition 1, possible values of $x$ are $8, 16, 24, ...$\n\nConsidering conditions 2 and 3 together, the possible values of $x$ are $16$ since it's the only multiple of 8 between 10 and 20.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{16}$.",
    "To find the possible value of x, we need to break down the given conditions:\n\n1. $x$ is a positive multiple of 8: This means $x$ can be represented as $8k$, where $k$ is a positive integer.\n\n2. $x^2 > 100$: Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x > 10$.\n\nSince $x<20$, we can combine the conditions to get $10 < x < 20$.\n\nNow, we need to find the positive multiples of 8 that satisfy this condition.\n\nThe positive multiples of 8 less than 20 are 8, 16.",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and arrive at the same answer, which is x = 16. However, Solution 1 and Solution 3 are slightly more detailed and easier to follow, as they break down the conditions step by step and provide a clear explanation for each step.\n\nBetween Solution 1 and Solution 3, Solution 3 is slightly more concise and easier to read, as it combines the conditions into a single statement and lists the multiples of 8 between 10 and 20 in a clear and concise manner.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 3. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 3",
  "solution": "This question gives multiple clues on what $x$ could be. Because $x^2>100$, we know that $x$ must be greater than 10, but $x$ is also less than 20. So $x$ is a multiple of 8 that is between 10 and 20. The only value that fits this description is $\\boxed{16}$.",
