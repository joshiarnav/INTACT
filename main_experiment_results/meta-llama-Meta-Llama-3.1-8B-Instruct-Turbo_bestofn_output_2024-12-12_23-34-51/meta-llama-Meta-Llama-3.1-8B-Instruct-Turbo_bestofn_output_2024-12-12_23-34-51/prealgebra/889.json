    "Since altitude $CD$ is $\\sqrt3$ centimeters, we can find the lengths of the sides of $\\Delta ABC$. \n\nWe know that triangle $ACD$ is a $30-60-90$ right triangle, with a right angle at $D$. Since the altitude of a $30-60-90$ triangle is the longer leg divided by $\\sqrt3$, $CD$ must be the shorter leg of triangle $ACD$. So $AD = 2CD$. Therefore, we have $AD = 2\\sqrt3$. Also, since the ratio of the sides of a $30-60-90$ right triangle is $1:\\sqrt3:2$, $AC$ (the hypotenuse of the triangle) is twice the length of the shorter leg, $AD$, so $AC = 2*2\\sqrt3 = 4\\sqrt3$. Also, in triangle $ACD$, the hypotenuse $AC$ is equal to $2CD/\\sqrt3$. Since we know that $CD = \\sqrt3$, we can confirm that $AC = 4\\sqrt3$. \n\nTo find the length of $BC$, we can find the length of $AC$ using the 30-60-90 triangle $CAB$. Since triangle $ACD$ has the same angles as triangle $CAB$, they must be similar triangles, so the segments $AC$ have the same ratio to the segments $BC$ in each triangle. Thus we can set up a proportion using the ratios of the corresponding sides of the similar triangles. In triangle $ACD$, the shorter leg $CD$ is $1$ and the hypotenuse (or longer leg) $AD$ is $2$. In triangle $CAB$, the corresponding side (shorter leg) $BC$ is not known and the hypotenuse $AC$ is $4\\sqrt3$. So we can set up the proportion $\\frac{BC}{4\\sqrt3} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$ which can also be rewritten as $\\frac{1}{4\\sqrt3} = \\frac{BC}{4\\sqrt3}$. From which we can find $BC$.  To do so, we multiply both sides of the equation  $\\frac{BC}{4\\sqrt3} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$ by $4\\sqrt3$ to find that $\\boxed{BC = 4}$.",
    "To find the area of $\\Delta ABC$, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given two sides and the included angle. If we label the side length of $\\Delta ABC$ as $b$ and the altitude to $AC$ as $h$, we can see from the diagram that $h = \\sqrt 3$ and $AC$ is the same length as $h$ (which is $\\sqrt 3$) and $\\angle ACB$ is $30$ degrees. \n\nFirstly, by using trigonometry in the right triangle $\\Delta ACD$, we can find the length of side AC. Let $AC = x$, $CD = \\sqrt 3$ and $\\angle CAD = 30$ degrees. Applying the sine function in triangle $\\Delta ACD$ we get, \n\n$$\n     \\begin{aligned}\n        \\sin (30^{\\circ}) = \\frac {\\sqrt 3}{x} \\quad \\quad \\rightarrow  \\quad \\quad  x = \\frac{\\sqrt 3}{\\sin 30^{\\circ}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ \nLooking up the table of values for trigonometric functions, we can see $\\sin 30^{\\circ} = \\frac 12$. Therefore $x = \\frac{\\sqrt 3}{\\frac 12} = 2 \\sqrt 3$.\n\nAC thus equals $2\\sqrt 3$.\n\n\nNow to find $AB$, we can use right triangle $\\Delta ABC$. $\\angle ACB = 30$, $AC = 2\\sqrt 3$ and $BC = \\sqrt 3$.\n\n\nApplying the cosine function in triangle $\\Delta ABC$ we get, \n\n     $$   \n       \\begin{aligned}\n        \\cos (30^{\\circ}) = \\frac {\\sqrt 3}{AB} \\quad \\quad \\rightarrow  \\quad \\quad  AB  = \\frac{\\sqrt 3}{\\cos 30^{\\circ}}\n\\end{aligned}\n    $$\n\n\n     $$   \n       \\begin{aligned}\n        \\cos (30^{\\circ}) = \\frac {\\sqrt 3}{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\nTherefore $AB = \\frac{\\sqrt 3}{\\frac {\\sqrt 3} 2} = 2$. Now we can determine the area of triangle $\\Delta ABC$. Area = 0.5 * base * height = 0.5 * AB * AC = 0.5 * 2 * 2 *  \\boxed{\\sqrt 3}$. However in calculating these areas, we see that AB is actually $2$ centimeters. So the area of $\\Delta ABC$ is 0.5 * 2 * $2 \\sqrt 3$ =  $\\boxed{2\\sqrt 3}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's analyze it step by step.\n\nFirst, we are given that altitude CD is $\\sqrt{3}$ centimeters. This helps us understand the triangle's dimensions.\n\nThe triangle $\\triangle ABC$ is a 30-60-90 right-angled triangle. The ratio for the sides of a 30-60-90 triangle is $1 : \\sqrt{3} : 2$, where the side opposite to the 30-degree angle is in proportion to $\\sqrt{3}$, the side opposite to the 60-degree angle is in proportion to $1$, and the hypotenuse is in proportion to $2$. \n\nGiven that the length of $CD$, which is the altitude of $\\triangle ABC$ and also the side opposite to the 60-degree angle in the smaller 30-60-90 triangle formed by $CD$ and $AC$, is $\\sqrt{3}$, we can determine $AC$ is twice of it, making it equal to $2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nSince the ratio of sides is $1 : \\sqrt{3} : 2$ for a 30-60-90 triangle and we know in $\\triangle ABC$, $AC = 2\\sqrt{3}$ and is in proportion of $2$, then $AB$, the side opposite the $30^\\circ$ angle and in proportion to $1$, will be $2$. \n\nWith that we found out, now let's look to find the area of the $\\triangle ABC$. To do so, we will apply the formula for the area of a triangle, which is: $\\frac{1}{2} * b * h$. But in this case, we will go for a different way. Here we can calculate the area by first calculating the area of the smaller 30-60-90 triangle, ($\\triangle ACD$), and then finding out the area of $\\triangle ABC$ using the information we have.\n\nNow for triangle $\\triangle ACD$: The base and height of $\\triangle ACD$ are $1$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ in proportion to $1 : \\sqrt{3}$, respectively. We will calculate the area using the formula: $\\frac{1}{2} * b * h$. For $\\triangle ADC$: \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\frac{1}{2} * 1 * \\sqrt{3} \\\\\n= \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\end{array}\n$$\nNow that we have the area of $\\triangle ADC$, we can now proceed to the next step in finding out the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nTo find out the area of $\\triangle ABC$, we will add the area of $\\triangle ACD$ to the area of the larger 30-60-90 right triangle ($\\triangle BCA$). The larger 30-60-90 right triangle has base $AB = 2$, which was calculated earlier and height $AC = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nAgain, using the area of a triangle formula: $\\frac{1}{2} * b * h$\n\nWe can calculate the area of $\\triangle BCA$: \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\frac{1}{2} * 2 * 2\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n= 2\\sqrt{3}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNow that we have the area of $\\triangle ADC$ and the area of $\\triangle BCD$, let's sum them to get the area of $\\triangle ABC$:\n\nArea of $\\triangle ABC$ = Area of $\\triangle ACD$ + Area of $\\triangle BCA$\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n& & Area\\ of\\ \\triangle\\ ABC \\\\\n= & & Area\\ of\\ \\triangle\\ ACD + Area\\ of\\ \\triangle\\ BCA \\\\\n= & & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + 2\\sqrt{3}\n\\end{array}\n$$\nUsing the property of addition of like terms, we can sum them up by first factoring out the common term: \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n& & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + 2\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n= & & \\sqrt{3}(\\frac{1}{2} + 2)\n\\end{array}\n$$\nNow that we factored it out, we can now proceed with calculating the final value: \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n& & \\sqrt{3}(\\frac{1}{2} + 2) \\\\\n= & & \\sqrt{3}(\\frac{1+4}{2}) \\\\\n= & & \\sqrt{3}(\\frac{5}{2})\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nSimplifying the final result, we have: $\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ square centsimeters as the area of the $\\triangle ABC$."
