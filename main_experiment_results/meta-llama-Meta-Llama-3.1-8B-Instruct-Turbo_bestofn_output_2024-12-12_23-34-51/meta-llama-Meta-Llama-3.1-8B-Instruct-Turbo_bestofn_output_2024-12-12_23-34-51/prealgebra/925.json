    "To find the probability that a randomly selected number from the set $\\{50, 51, 52, 53, ... , 999\\}$ is a two-digit number, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Count the total number of numbers**: \n   The given set is a range of consecutive integers, starting from 50 and ending at 999. \n   To find the total count, we need to find the difference between the end and the start and add 1 (to include both ends).\n   So, the total count is $999 - 50 + 1 = 950$ numbers.\n\n2. **Count the two-digit numbers in the set**:\n   We know that the set contains two-digit and three-digit numbers. \n   We are interested in the two-digit numbers, which range from 50 to 99.\n   The count of two-digit numbers can be found by finding the difference between 99 and 50, and adding 1.\n   So, the count of two-digit numbers is $99 - 50 + 1 = 50$ numbers.\n\n3. **Calculate the probability**:\n   Now that we have the total count and the count of two-digit numbers, we can find the probability of selecting a two-digit number.\n   The probability is the count of two-digit numbers divided by the total count.\n   So, the probability is $\\frac{50}{950} = \\frac{1}{19}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$",

    "To find the probability of selecting a two-digit number from the set, we first need to determine the total number of numbers in the set and the number of two-digit numbers in the set.\n\nThe set starts from 50 and ends at 999.

  "critique": "After analyzing each solution, I can conclude that Solution 1 is the best solution. \n\nSolution 1 correctly counts the total number of numbers in the set and the number of two-digit numbers. It then calculates the probability by dividing the number of two-digit numbers by the total number of numbers, resulting in a correct probability of 1/19.\n\nSolution 2 has a mistake in counting the total number of numbers in the set. It incorrectly adds 1 to the result of 999 - 50, which should be 951, but then adds 2 and 1 again, resulting in 950 + 1 = 951. However, the correct approach to count the total number of numbers in the set is to simply subtract the starting number from the ending number and add 1, which is (999 - 50) + 1 = 951. But then it incorrectly divides 53 by 950 instead of 951.\n\nSolution 3 is almost identical to Solution 1, and it also correctly counts the total number of numbers in the set and the number of two-digit numbers, resulting in the same probability of 1/19.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1.\n\nThe index of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "To count the number of numbers in this set, we subtract 49 from all of the numbers, giving the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 950 \\}$, making it obvious that there are 950 numbers total. Furthermore, the set $\\{ 50, 51, 52, \\ldots, 98, 99 \\}$ corresponds to the more easily counted $\\{ 1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 49, 50 \\}$ by subtracting 49. So, the probability of selecting a two-digit number is $\\frac{50}{950} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$.",
