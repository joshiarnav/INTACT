    "To find the point in the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$ that is closest to the point $(1,2,3),$ we can use the following steps:\n\n### Step 1: Normal Vector of the Plane\nThe equation of the plane is $3x - 4y + 5z = 30.$ \nFrom the general form of a plane $Ax + By + Cz = D,$ we know that the coefficients of x, y, and z are the components of its normal vector (A, B, C) or (3, -4, 5).\n\n### Step 2: Line Parametric Equations\nTo find the point in the plane that is closest to the point (1, 2, 3), we consider a line with direction vector (3, -4, 5) (the normal vector of the plane) passing through the given point (1, 2, 3). \nThe parametric equations of this line are given by: x = 1 + 3t, y = 2 - 4t, z = 3 + 5t, where t is a parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Substituting Line into the Plane Equation\nWe substitute these parametric equations into the equation of the plane:\n3(1 + 3t) - 4(2 - 4t) + 5(3 + 5t) = 30\n\n### Step 4: Solving for t\nNow we solve the resulting equation for t:\n3 + 9t - 8 + 16t + 15 + 25t = 30\nCombine like terms:\n50t = 20\nDivide both sides by 50:\nt = 20/50\nt = 2/5\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Closest Point\nSubstitute t into the parametric equations of the line to find the point in the plane that is closest to the given point (1, 2, 3):\nx = 1 + 3(2/5) = 1 + 6/5 = 11/5\ny = 2 - 4(2/5) = 2 - 8/5 = 2/5\nz = 3 + 5(2/5) = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTherefore, the point in the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$ that is closest to the point (1, 2, 3) is:\n$\\boxed{(11/5, 2/5, 5)}$",
    "To find the point on the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$ that is closest to the point $(1,2,3)$, we need to find the line passing through $(1,2,3)$ that is perpendicular to the plane.\n\nThe normal vector of the plane is $(3,-4,5)$, which is also the direction vector of the line.\n\nSo, the parametric equations of the line are:\n\n$x = 1 + 3t$\n$y = 2 - 4t$\n$z = 3 + 5t$\n\nNow, we need to find the point on the line that is closest to the plane. This point will be the intersection of the line and the plane.\n\nWe substitute the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane:\n\n$3(1 + 3t) - 4(2 - 4t) + 5(3 + 5t) = 30$\n\nExpanding the equation:\n\n$3 + 9t - 8 + 16t + 15 + 25t = 30$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$50t + 10 = 30$\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n$50t = 20$\n\nDivide both sides by 50:\n\n$t = \\frac{20}{50} = \\frac{2}{5}$\n\nNow that we have the value of t, we can find the coordinates of the point on the line:\n\n$x = 1 + 3(\\frac{2}{5}) = 1 + \\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{11}{5}$\n$y = 2 - 4(\\frac{2}{5}) = 2 - \\frac{8}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}$\n$z = 3 + 5(\\frac{2}{5}) = 3 + 2 = 5$\n\nSo, the point in the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$ that is closest to the point $(1,2,3)$ is:\n\n$\\boxed{(\\frac{11}{5}, \\frac{2}{5}, 5)}$",
    "To find the point in the plane that is closest to the given point, we can make use of the fact that the line connecting the point in the plane to the given point is perpendicular to the plane. \n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation of the plane in the standard form:\n\n$3x - 4y + 5z = 30$\n\nNow, let's find the normal vector to the plane, which is [3, -4, 5].\n\nNext, we need to find the equation of the line passing through the given point [1, 2, 3] and perpendicular to the plane. The direction vector of the line is the same as the normal vector of the plane, which is [3, -4, 5].\n\nWe can parameterize the line as:\n\nx(t) = 1 + 3t\ny(t) = 2 - 4t\nz(t) = 3 + 5t\n\nNow, we need to find the point where the line intersects the plane. We can substitute the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane and solve for t:\n\n3(1 + 3t) - 4(2 - 4t) + 5(3 + 5t) = 30\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\n3 + 9t - 8 + 16t + 15 + 25t = 30\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n50t + 10 = 30\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n50t = 20\n\nDivide both sides by 50:\n\nt = 2/5\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of t back into the parametric equations of the line to find the point in the plane that is closest to the given point:\n\nx(t) = 1 + 3t\ny(t) = 2 - 4t\nz(t) = 3 + 5t\n\nx(2/5) = 1 + 3(2/5) = 1 + 6/5 = 11/5\ny(2/5) = 2 - 4(2/5) = 2 - 8/5 = 2/5\nz(2/5) = 3 + 5(2/5) = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTherefore, the point in the plane that is closest to the point (1, 2, 3) is (11/5, 2/5, 5).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{11}{5}, \\frac{2}{5}, 5\\right)}$"
