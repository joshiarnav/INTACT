    "We want to find the transformation that maps $ABCD$ to $A'B'C'D'$.\nTo make this transformation easier, let's consider some points on the plane.\nThe transformation has the following information: $A$ goes to $A,$ $D$ goes to $B,$ $C$ goes to $D'$ and $B$ goes to $C'$ and $A'$ is some position but is directly going to A.\n\nLet's break it down further by considering the midpoints of the sides of $ABCD,$ which are also the centers of the triangles within the square.\nWe can see that the midpoints of the sides are:\n$\\frac{AD}{2}$ which goes to $B,$ $\\frac{BC}{2}$ which goes to $C',$ $\\frac{CD}{2}$ which goes to $D'$ and $\\frac{DA}{2}$ which goes to A'.\n\nWe can see a pattern develop that $ABCD$ goes to $BDC'A'.$\nLooking at the triangle ABC we can get $A\\rightarrow B, B\\rightarrow C, C\\rightarrow A.$\nWe can see a rotation of $A'BC$ with some angle that is about 180 degrees counterclockwise or a clockwise rotation of 90 degrees.\n\nLooking at the equations to make this happen, the $x$-coordinate of $A'$ is the negative of the $x-$coordinate of $A$ plus $a,$ where $a$ is the horizontal distance between points $C$ and $B.$\nThe $y-$coordinate of $A'$ is not needed.

    "To find the matrix that sends square $ABCD$ to square $A'B'C'D'$, we need to calculate the transformations that map each point to its corresponding image. \n\nFirst, we will map $ABCD$ to $A'B'C'D'$ with a rotation and a translation. \n\nLooking at the coordinates, $A$ goes to $A'$ with no change in position and no rotation. Thus, we need to translate $A$ from the origin to its current position $(0,3),$ and then rotate and translate that to the coordinates of $A'$ (which is where A is located originally).\n\nThen we can map $A$ to its image $A'$ using the translation matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$ and rotation and translation later.\n\n$B$ and $C$ go to $B'$ and $C'$, which also does not involve a translation that takes the origin to those two points at this point. However, later translations that also involve a rotation later, will later take B to its target at $B'$.\n\nThe rotation that takes $ABCD$ to $A'B'C'D'$ is a $90^{\\circ}$ counter-clockwise rotation.\n\n$D$ goes to $D'$ which is in the 4th quadrant.\n\nTo determine the translation that is required, let's first find the position of $D'$ with respect to the original point $D$. \n\nThe original $D$ is at $(1,0)$, so we need to find the position of $D'$.\n\nSince $D$ and $D'$ form a square with $C$, the distance between $D'$ and the line passing through $C$, is equal to the distance between $D$ and the line passing through $C$. \n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the line passing through $C$. To find the slope, we need to find the direction ratios of the line that passes through $C$. \n\nSince $C$ is at $(-4,1)$ and $D$ is at $(1,0)$, the direction ratio of the line is $(1 - -4 , 0 - 1) = (5, -1)$. The slope of the line passing through $C$ is $-1/5$.\n\nThe equation of the line passing through $C$ is $y - 1 = -1/5(x + 4) \\implies 5y - 5 = -x - 4 \\implies x + 5y = -1$.\n\nThe distance between the line passing through $C$ and the point $D'$ can be calculated using the distance from a point to a line formula. \n\nThe point $D'$ is at $(1,1)$. The distance between $D'$ and the line passing through $C$ is $| -1 - 6| / \\sqrt{1^2 + 5^2 } = 7 / \\sqrt{26}$.\n\nHowever, we know that $D$ lies on the line with slope $-1/5$. Let's say $D'$ also lies on this line.\n\nThe point $D'$ is on the line with slope $-1/5$, then $y = - \\frac{1}{5}(x + 4)$. If we substitute the value of $y$ in the equation of the line that passes through $D'$ at $x = -4$, we get $y = -4/5 - 4/5 = -8/5$.\n\nNow we know the $y$-coordinate of $D'$ and we know that the distance between $D'$ and the line passing through $C$ is equal to the distance between $D$ and the line passing through $C$. Now we calculate the distance between $D$ and the line passing through $C$. \n\nThe distance between $D$ and the line passing through $C$ is $| -1/5 (1 + 4 ) - 0| / \\sqrt{1^2 + 5^2} = 5/ \\sqrt{26}$.\n\nSince the distance between $D'$ and the line passing through $C$ is equal to the distance between $D$ and the line passing through $C$, we can say that:\n\n$|-\\frac{1}{5}(x - 4) - 1|/\\sqrt{26} =  5/\\sqrt{26}$. \n\nThis is satisfied when $x = 1$. \n\nThus, the point $D'$ is at $(1, -1)$.\n\nNow, we can map $D$ to its image $D'$ using a rotation matrix and a translation. \n\nWe can use a rotation matrix of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ to rotate $D$ through an angle of $90^{\\circ}$, and a translation matrix of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ y & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ to translate the rotated point to its final position.\n\nThe translation matrix is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ y & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n$y$ is the $y$-coordinate of the point to which the origin (or any other point) is translated.\n\n$y = 1 - (-1) = 2$\n\nThus, the translation matrix is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNow, we can multiply the rotation matrix and the translation matrix to get the matrix that maps $D$ to its image $D'$.\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThus, the matrix that maps $D$ to its image $D'$ is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNow, we can determine the matrix that maps $ABCD$ to $A'B'C'D'$.\n\nSince $D$ goes to $D'$, and $A$ goes to $A'$, and the square $ABCD$ is mapped to square $A'B'C'D'$ and $A'B'C'D'$ and $ABCD$ and are both squares, we can say that the transformation is a rotation of $90^{\\circ}$ about the origin and a translation.\n\nThe rotation matrix is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe translation matrix is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ y & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $y = 3$.\n\nThus, the matrix that maps $ABCD$ to $A'B'C'D'$ is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}}$.",
    "The transformation in this problem is a composition of two reflections:\n1. A reflection over the line through $A$ and $D,$ and\n2. A reflection over the line through $B$ and $C.$\n\nTo find the matrix for reflecting a point $(x,y)$ over a line that passes through the origin with an angle of $\\theta,$ we can use the matrix formula:\n\n$\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos (2\\theta) & \\sin (2\\theta) \\\\ \\sin (2\\theta) & -\\cos (2\\theta) \\end{pmatrix}.$\n\nHowever, in this case, we need to find the angles of the lines through $A$ and $D,$ and through $B$ and $C.$  The slope of the line through $A$ and $D$ is 0, since it is horizontal.  Therefore, the slope of the line through $B$ and $C$ is $\\frac{y_B - y_C}{x_B - x_C} = \\frac{2-1}{-3-(-4)} = -\\frac{1}{1} = -1.$\n\nNow, we know that any line with a slope of $-1$ makes an angle of $135^{\\circ}$ with the positive $x$-axis.  Let $\\theta_1$ be the angle between the positive $x$-axis and the line through $A$ and $D,$ and let $\\theta_2$ be the angle between the positive $x$-axis and the line through $B$ and $C.$  Then, we have\n\n$\\tan \\theta_1 = 0,$\n$\\tan \\theta_2 = -1.$\n\nSince $\\tan \\theta_2 = -\\tan 45^{\\circ},$ we have $\\theta_2 = 135^{\\circ}.$  Similarly, since $\\tan \\theta_1 = 0,$ we have $\\theta_1 = 0^{\\circ}.$\n\nNow, we can find the matrices for reflecting over these lines:\n\nFor the first line, we have $\\theta = \\theta_1 = 0,$ so the reflection matrix is:\n\n$\\mathbf{M}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos (2 \\cdot 0) & \\sin (2 \\cdot 0) \\\\ \\sin (2 \\cdot 0) & -\\cos (2 \\cdot 0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}.$\n\nFor the second line, we have $\\theta = \\theta_2 = 135^{\\circ},$ so the reflection matrix is:\n\n$\\mathbf{M}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos (2 \\cdot 135) & \\sin (2 \\cdot 135) \\\\ \\sin (2 \\cdot 135) & -\\cos (2 \\cdot 135) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos 270 & \\sin 270 \\\\ \\sin 270 & -\\cos 270 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$\n\nFinally, we can find the composition of these reflections, which is our final matrix $\\mathbf{M}$:\n\n$\\mathbf{M} = \\mathbf{M}_2 \\mathbf{M}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.}$"
