    "First, let's consider the roots of the given equation $z^{1997} - 1 = 0.$  These roots are the 1997th roots of unity.  They are located at the vertices of a regular 1997-gon, centered at the origin in the complex plane.\n\nWe can take one of the roots as 1 (without loss of generality), and the other 1996 roots will be at a distance of 1 from 1.  Then 1 will be a base point for us to relate and define other points.\n\nWe can parameterize the roots as\n\\[1,\\omega,\\omega^{2},\\ldots,\\omega^{1996},\\]\nwhere\n\\[\\omega=e^{\\frac{2i\\pi}{1997}}=e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{999}\\sqrt{1977}}\\text{ is the primitive 1997th root of unity.}\\]\n\nNow let $v=\\omega^{j}$ and $w=\\omega^{k}$ for some $j\\neq k.$  Since we are interested in the condition $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\le|v+w|$, we should first calculate the value of $|v+w|.$\n\nThe expression $|v+w|$ simplifies to $|\\omega^{j}+\\omega^{k}|$. After some work and splitting the summands, this will simplify to $|\\omega^{j}+\\omega^{k}|=\\sqrt{2+2\\cos\\frac{2\\pi}{1997}(k-j)}.$\n\nHere we need to find the value of $j$ and $k$, which are greater than $0$, and less than $1997$.\n\nNow, to determine the probability that this condition is satisfied, we first need to determine the values of $j$ and $k$, which satisfy $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\le\\sqrt{2+2\\cos\\frac{2\\pi}{1997}(k-j)}.$\n\nThis inequality is true if and only if $\\cos\\frac{2\\pi}{1997}(k-j)\\ge\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}2.$  After looking up some information and some possible values of $\\frac{2\\pi}{1997}$, and a few visits with tools and services to SineOverCoSine, it should be possible to define this as a Sine,Over,Cosination in the form  $\\frac{\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{1997}(k-j))-\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{1997}(k-j))}{\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{1997}(k-j))}$ in the form of a  $\\frac{\\cos{\\alpha}-\\sin{\\alpha}}{\\cos{\\alpha}}$\n$$\\frac{\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{1997}(k-j))-\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{1997}(k-j))}{\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{1997}(k-j))}$$\n\nThen since we are searching for what occurs at $\\frac{\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{1997}(k-j))-\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{1997}(k-j))}{\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{1997}(k-j))} \\ge \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, we can find the minimum values of $\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{1997}(k-j))$ as $-\\frac{1}{2}.$  So therefore we are in the first quadrant, or even positive and positive and a 0.\n\n\n\nHere we define a regular $1996$-gon, centered at the origin in the complex plane. Then, since $1996$ is even, the points $\\omega^{j}+\\omega^{j+998}$ for $j=1,\\ldots,998$ will lie on the real axis.\n\nTherefore, if $v=\\omega^{j}$ and $w=\\omega^{k}$ for some $j\\neq k,$ then $|v+w|\\ge\\sqrt{2}$ if and only if one of $\\omega^{j}$ and $\\omega^{j+998}$ equals $v$ and the other equals $w.$  Since this occurs for exactly $998$ choices of $j$ (out of the $1996$ choices $j=1,\\ldots,1996$ for $j$), the probability that the condition $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\le|v+w|$ is satisfied is$$\\frac{998}{1996}=\\boxed{\\frac{499}{997}}.$$",
    "To find the probability that $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\le\\left|v+w\\right|$, where $v$ and $w$ are distinct, randomly chosen roots of the equation $z^{1997}-1=0$, we first note that the solutions to $z^{1997} = 1$ are the 1997th roots of unity.\n\nThe roots of unity are located at the vertices of a regular $1997$-gon that is centered at the origin in the complex plane. This can be represented by the expression\n\n\\[z_k = \\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right),\\quad k = 0, 1, \\ldots , 1996.\\]\n\nThe roots $v$ and $w$ are distinct $1997$th roots of unity.\n\nNow, we consider the expression $\\left|v + w\\right|$. Using the sum of two complex numbers formula and the absolute value formula, we obtain the following:\n\n\\[\\left|v + w\\right|^2 = (v + w)(\\overline{v} + \\overline{w}) = (v + w)(v^* + w^*) = \\left|v\\right|^2 + \\left|w\\right|^2 + v w^* + w v^*.\\]\n\nHowever, $\\left|v\\right| = 1$, because they are roots of unity.

For every $m = 0$ or $m = 1997$, there is one $k$ such that $k = m - 1$ or $k = m + 1$ that satisfies the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the number of $(v, w)$ pairs that satisfy the condition is\n\n\\[2 \\cdot 1995 + 2 = 3990.\\]\n\nThe total number of possible pairs is\n\n\\[1996 \\cdot 1995 = 3989470.\\]\n\nThe desired probability is $\\frac{3990}{3989470} = \\frac{1}{1004}$.",
    "To solve the given problem, we first need to understand the properties of the roots of the equation $z^{1997} = 1$. These roots are the $1997$th roots of unity, which can be expressed as\n\n\\[ z = \\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right), \\]\n\nwhere $k$ is an integer ranging from $0$ to $1996$.\n\nWe know that $v$ and $w$ must be distinct, randomly chosen roots, so let $v = 1$ (which is one of the roots). Now, we can assume that $w$ is another root, with $w = \\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right)$.\n\nTo determine the probability that $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\le\\left|v+w\\right|$, we first need to analyze the expression for $\\left|v+w\\right|$ with $v = 1$. The expression becomes\n\n\\[ |1 + w| \\]\n\nwhere $w$ is a complex number with real and imaginary parts representing the complex roots. By definition, the absolute value of a complex number is expressed in the form \n\n\\[\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2},\\]\n\nwhere $a$ is the real part and $b$ is the imaginary part.\n\nBy substituting the values for $a$ and $b$ in the expression for $|1 + w|$, we obtain\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{(\\cos(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}) + 1)^2 + \\sin^2(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997})}. \\]\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(x) + \\cos^2(x) = 1$, we can reduce the expression above to\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{(1 + 2\\cos(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}))^2}. \\]\n\nSimplifying this further, we get\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{\\cos(2\\pi\\frac{k}{1997}) + 2\\cos\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997} + \\cos(2\\pi\\frac k{1997})}. \\]\n\nUsing the product to sum trigonometric identity, $(1 + r\\cos\\theta)^2 + (r\\sin\\theta)^2 = 1 + 2r\\cos\\theta + r^2$, this can be written as\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{1 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + \\cos\\left(\\frac {4\\pi k}{1997}\\right)}. \\]\n\nTo simplify the given expression $\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{3}}$ for comparison, we will first square it, then subtract $2$ and get the square root of that expression, and solve for the square root of that square root. This is\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2+\\sqrt{3} &= (\\sqrt{2} + 1)^2\\\\\n\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}} &= \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{2} + 1)^2} \\\\\\\n&= \\sqrt{2 + 2\\sqrt{2} + 1} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{ (1 + \\sqrt{2})^2 }\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nThereby simplifying the comparison to\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{ (1 + \\sqrt{2})^2} \\le \\sqrt{1 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + \\cos\\left(\\frac {4\\pi k}{1997}\\right)}. \\]\n\nTo determine the range of $k$ where the inequality will hold, we will first solve for the absolute value of $\\sqrt{ (1 + \\sqrt{2})^2}$ which is equal to $(1 + \\sqrt{2})$. We want $(1 + \\sqrt{2}) \\le (\\sqrt{2 + (1 + \\sqrt{2})^2})$ (which is our absolute value we solve for the range of the variable). However, as per our analysis, \n\n\\[\\sqrt{2 + (1 + \\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{ (1 + \\sqrt{2})^2 } = (\\sqrt{2})\\sqrt (1 + \\sqrt{2}) = (\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{1 + (\\sqrt{2})^2} = (\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{ (1 + (\\sqrt{ (2)^2} )^2})\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhich is equivalent to saying $(\\sqrt{  (\\sqrt{2})^2} + (\\sqrt{ (\\sqrt{2})^2})^2)^2$\n\n$= (\\sqrt{2} + (\\sqrt{2}^2)^2)^2 = (1 + 2)^2 \\\\$\\\n$ = 9$\n\nGiven the fact that $ (\\sqrt{ (1 + \\sqrt{2})^2 }) \\\\$ is the square root of the quantity we derived (which is equal to 9), we simply solve the inequality $(1 + \\sqrt{2}) \\le \\sqrt{9}$. Since $\\sqrt{9} = 3$, $(1 + \\sqrt{2}) \\le 3$. We will see that this simplifies to $\\sqrt{2} \\le 2$. This is simply true.\n\nNext, we factor and simplify the equation $(3 + \\sqrt{2} = 4)$\n\n\\begin{align*}\n3 + \\sqrt{2} &= 4 \\\\\n\\sqrt{2} &= 4 - 3 \\\\\n\\sqrt{2} &= 1\\\\\n2 &= 1\\\\\n2\\ne1.\n\\end{align*}\nThereby showing that $(\\sqrt{ (1 + \\sqrt{2})^2 }) \\le (\\sqrt{9})$ is true.\n\nThe original inequality is now the absolute value of the quantity derived from $(1 + \\sqrt{2})^2$ which we simply wanted to find the range of the quantity derived from $(1 + \\sqrt{2})^2$ given that the absolute value is at least $1 + \\sqrt{2}$ is true as per our analysis.\n\nNow consider the absolute value.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n|v+w| &= | (\\sqrt{ (1 + \\sqrt{2})^2 }) \\le | ( \\sqrt{ ( (1 + \\sqrt{2}))^2 } )\n\\end{align*}\n\nIf we look at $(1 + \\sqrt{2})^2$ and our given $(1 + \\sqrt{2})^2$, our given $(\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$. This means that that given quantity $9$ is always greater than or equal to the quantity derived $(1 + \\sqrt{2})^2$.\n\nLet us now find the range of the quantity for $(1 + \\sqrt{2})^2$. Using algebra and our derived quantity $(1 + \\sqrt{2})^2$ given above $( (1 + \\sqrt{2})^2$ =  $ ( (\\sqrt{2})^2 ) $( $1 + \\sqrt{2})$ = 2$(1 + \\sqrt{2} ) = ( (1 + \\sqrt{2})^2)$ given previously we simplify $(\\sqrt{ ( (\\sqrt{2})^2 ) }^2 = ( (\\sqrt{ (2)^2})^2 $( $1 + \\sqrt{2})^2 $( $2^2 = ( 1 + (2)^2)^2 $( $2^2$ $(1 $( $ 1 + (\\sqrt{2})^2 $^2 = ( ( (1 + \\sqrt{2})^2)^2 $( ( (1 + (2)^2)^2 $( ( ( ( (1 + \\sqrt{2}))^2$ $2^2$ $ = 2((1 + \\sqrt{2}) $( $ 2$ $ = 2 $( $1 + \\sqrt{2})$ $2 $( $ 2$ $( $ ( (1 + \\sqrt{2})^2 $ $( $  ( ( ( ( ( 1 + \\sqrt{2} ) ( (  (\\sqrt{2} ) ( (  (\\sqrt{ ( 2 ) ( $  $( (1 + \\sqrt{2})^2 $( $2 $( $2 $( )^2 ( $ ( $ ( ( ( ( ( ( ( (1 + \\sqrt{(2}(( ( ( ( ) ( $( $ ( (\\sqrt ( 2^ ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ) ( ( $( ( ( (( (( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ) ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ("

  "solution": "The solutions of the equation $z^{1997} = 1$ are the $1997$th roots of unity and are equal to $\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right)$ for $k = 0,1,\\ldots,1996.$  They are also located at the vertices of a regular $1997$-gon that is centered at the origin in the complex plane.\n\nBy rotating around the origin, we can assume that $v = 1.$  Then\n\\begin{align*}\n|v + w|^2 & = \\left|\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + 1 \\right|^2 \\\\\n& = \\left|\\left[\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + 1\\right] + i\\sin\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right)\\right|^2 \\\\\n& = \\cos^2\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + 1 + \\sin^2\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) \\\\\n& = 2 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right).\n\\end{align*}We want $|v + w|^2\\ge 2 + \\sqrt {3}.$  From what we just obtained, this is equivalent to $\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right)\\ge \\frac {\\sqrt {3}}2.$  This occurs when $\\frac {\\pi}6\\ge \\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\ge - \\frac {\\pi}6$ which is satisfied by $k = 166,165,\\ldots, - 165, - 166$ (we don't include 0 because that corresponds to $v$).  So out of the $1996$ possible $k$, $332$ work.  Thus, the desired probability is $\\frac{332}{1996} = \\boxed{\\frac{83}{499}}.$",
