  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They all arrive at the same conclusion: the area of $S'$ is 44. However, I will analyze them for clarity, concision, and adherence to mathematical conventions.\n\nSolution 1 is clear and concise, but it could benefit from a more explicit explanation of how the determinant is calculated and why it is used to scale the area.\n\nSolution 2 is very similar to Solution 1, but it includes a few more words to explain the calculation of the determinant. It also uses a more formal notation for the determinant, which can be helpful for readers who are not familiar with this notation.\n\nSolution 3 is a bit more detailed, with explicit steps for calculating the determinant and multiplying it by the area of $S$. However, it is also a bit more verbose than Solutions 1 and 2.\n\nBased on these analyses, I would select Solution 2 as the best solution. It strikes a good balance between clarity, concision, and mathematical rigor.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 2",
