    "To find the ordered pair $(c,d)$, we need to use the property of an inverse matrix. If a matrix is its own inverse, then its square must be the identity matrix.\n\nLet's call the given matrix $A$. We have:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\n\nTo find $A^2$, we multiply the matrix by itself:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\n\nUsing matrix multiplication rules, we get:\n\\[A^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\times 3 + (-1) \\times c & 3 \\times (-1) + (-1) \\times d \\\\ c \\times 3 + d \\times c & c \\times (-1) + d \\times d \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[A^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 9 - c & -3 - d \\\\ 3c + dc & -c + d^2 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\n\nSince $A$ is its own inverse, $A^2$ must be the identity matrix, which is:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\n\nEquating the corresponding elements of $A^2$ and the identity matrix, we get four equations:\n\n1. $9 - c = 1$\n2. $-3 - d = 0$\n3. $3c + dc = 0$\n4. $-c + d^2 = 1$\n\nSolving equation 1, we find that $c = 8$.\n\nSolving equation 2, we find that $d = -3$.\n\nWe can substitute $c = 8$ and $d = -3$ into equation 4 and verify that it's satisfied:\n$-c + d^2 = 1 \\implies -(8) + (-3)^2 = -(8) + 9 = 1.$\n\nThis confirms that the solution $(c, d)$ satisfies equation 4. \n\nNow, let's substitute $c = 8$ and $d = -3$ into equation 3:\n$3c + dc = 3(8) + (-3)(8) = 24 - 24 = 0.$\n\nThis confirms that the solution $(c, d)$ satisfies equation 3.\n\nThus, the ordered pair $(c,d)$ is $\\boxed{(8,-3)}$.",
