    "To find the fourth vertex of the regular tetrahedron, we need to use the property that the sum of the squares of the distances between any vertex of a regular tetrahedron and the other three vertices is the same for any of the vertices.\n\nLet the coordinates of the fourth vertex be $(x, y, z)$. \n\nThe distance between $(0,1,2)$ and $(4,2,1)$ is $\\sqrt{(4-0)^2+(2-1)^2+(1-2)^2} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe distance between $(0,1,2)$ and $(x,y,z)$ is $\\sqrt{(x-0)^2+(y-1)^2+(z-2)^2}$.\n\nThe distance between $(4,2,1)$ and $(x,y,z)$ is $\\sqrt{(x-4)^2+(y-2)^2+(z-1)^2}$.\n\nThe distance between $(3,1,5)$ and $(x,y,z)$ is $\\sqrt{(x-3)^2+(y-1)^2+(z-5)^2}$.\n\nSince the sum of the squares of these distances is the same for any of the vertices, we have the following equation:\n$18+18=2((x-0)^2+(y-1)^2+(z-2)^2)+2((x-4)^2+(y-2)^2+(z-1)^2)+2((x-3)^2+(y-1)^2+(z-5)^2)$\n\nBy simplifying the equation and assuming that $(x,y,z)$ is an integer, we get the following equations:\n$4x^2-24x+16y^2-8y+4z^2-12z+60=0$\n\nThis is a highly non-linear equation in three variables, so we need a different approach.\n\nA  regular tetrahedron is a equilateral triangle when projected onto each face. We can find the midpoint of each face, then find the point that is equidistant from the three vertices of the face.\n\nThe midpoint of the face that has vertices at $(0,1,2)$, $(4,2,1)$, and $(3,1,5)$ is \n$\\left(\\frac{0+4+3}{3}, \\frac{1+2+1}{3}, \\frac{2+1+5}{3}\\right)=(\\frac{7}{3},\\frac{4}{3},\\frac{8}{3})$.\n\nWe can find the point that is equidistant from the vertices $(0,1,2)$, $(4,2,1)$, and $(3,1,5)$, by taking the average of the coordinates of the vertices. The average is\n$(\\frac{0+4+3}{3}, \\frac{1+2+1}{3}, \\frac{2+1+5}{3})=(\\frac{7}{3},\\frac{4}{3},\\frac{8}{3})$.\n\nThis means that the fourth vertex $(x, y, z)$ must be equidistant from the vertices $(0,1,2)$, $(4,2,1)$, and $(3,1,5)$ and from the point $(\\frac{7}{3},\\frac{4}{3},\\frac{8}{3})$.\n\nThe point $(x, y, z)$ is equidistant from the point $(\\frac{7}{3},\\frac{4}{3},\\frac{8}{3})$,  $(0,1,2)$, $(4,2,1)$, and from $(3,1,5)$ when the distance of the points are same from $(x, y, z)$.\n\nSo, let's assume that the distance of all these points from $(x, y, z)$ is $d$. Then by distance formula,\n$d=\\sqrt{\\left(x-\\frac{7}{3}\\right)^2+\\left(y-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2+\\left(z-\\frac{8}{3}\\right)^2}$\n\n$d=\\sqrt{(x-0)^2+(y-1)^2+(z-2)^2}$\n\n$d=\\sqrt{(x-4)^2+(y-2)^2+(z-1)^2}$\n\n$d=\\sqrt{(x-3)^2+(y-1)^2+(z-5)^2}$\n\nLet us solve the first three of those equations for $d$.",
    "To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex, we can use the fact that the four vertices of a regular tetrahedron are equidistant from each other.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the distance between the given vertices. Let's call the fourth vertex $P = (x, y, z)$.\n\nThe distance between two points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ is given by:\n\n$\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 + (z_2-z_1)^2}$\n\nLet's denote the distance between the given vertices and the fourth vertex as $d$.\n\nThe distance between $(0,1,2)$ and $(4,2,1)$ is:\n\n$\\sqrt{(4-0)^2 + (2-1)^2 + (1-2)^2} = \\sqrt{16+1+1} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$\n\nSimilarly, the distance between $(4,2,1)$ and $(3,1,5)$ is:\n\n$\\sqrt{(3-4)^2 + (1-2)^2 + (5-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1+1+16} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$\n\nNow we can calculate the distance between $(0,1,2)$ and $(3,1,5)$, which should be equal to $3\\sqrt{2}$:\n\n$\\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (1-1)^2 + (5-2)^2} = \\sqrt{9+0+9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$\n\nSince the distance between the given vertices and the fourth vertex is $3\\sqrt{2}$, and the distance between the given vertices is also $3\\sqrt{2}$, the fourth vertex must be equidistant from the given vertices.\n\nSince we are looking for integer coordinates, the coordinates of the fourth vertex must be such that the distances between it and the given vertices are all integers. \n\nTo simplify the calculations, we will look for the coordinates of the fourth vertex that make the distances integer and then check that they satisfy the condition of equidistance.\n\nSince we have a regular tetrahedron, the distances between the vertices are all equal. The given distances are $3\\sqrt{2}$, and we want the integer distances to be a multiple of $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nAssuming the integer distance is $k$, we get $k^2 = 18$, and solving for $k$, we get $k = \\pm3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSince $k$ is an integer, we can look for integer solutions of the form $(x, y, z)$ such that $x^2+y^2+z^2 = 18$, and also such that the distances between $(x, y, z)$ and the given vertices are also integers.\n\nNow let's calculate the squared distances from the given points to the fourth vertex:\n\nThe squared distance from $(0,1,2)$ is: \n$(x-0)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-2)^2 = x^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-2)^2$\n\nThe squared distance from $(4,2,1)$ is: \n$(x-4)^2 + (y-2)^2 + (z-1)^2 = (x-4)^2 + (y-2)^2 + (z-1)^2$\n\nThe squared distance from $(3,1,5)$ is: \n$(x-3)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-5)^2 = (x-3)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-5)^2$\n\nWe need these distances to be equal to $18$, since the distances between the vertices are $3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nLet's calculate the squared distances in a simpler way:\n\nLet $d_1 = x^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-2)^2 = 18$\n\n$d_2 = (x-4)^2 + (y-2)^2 + (z-1)^2 = 18$\n\n$d_3 = (x-3)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-5)^2 = 18$\n\nNow we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n$x^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-2)^2 = 18$\n$(x-4)^2 + (y-2)^2 + (z-1)^2 = 18$\n$(x-3)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-5)^2 = 18$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second and third equations, we get:\n\n$-8x + 14y - 7z = 0$ (from the second equation)\n\n$-6x + 10y - 9z = 0$ (from the third equation)\n\nNow we need to solve these two equations. We can use the substitution or elimination method to solve the system of equations.\n\nAfter solving the system, we get:\n$x = -2$\n$y = 4$\n$z = 0$\n\nTherefore, the fourth vertex of the regular tetrahedron is $(\\boxed{-2, 4, 0})$.",
    "To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex, let's first calculate the edge lengths between the given vertices. Since the given points form a regular tetrahedron, all edges will be of equal length.\n\nWe can use the distance formula to find the distance between two points in 3D space:\n\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 + (z_2-z_1)^2}\\]\n\nLet's calculate the distance between the points $(0,1,2)$ and $(4,2,1)$:\n\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(4-0)^2 + (2-1)^2 + (1-2)^2}\\]\n\\[d = \\sqrt{16+1+1}\\]\n\\[d = \\sqrt{18}\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the distance between the points $(0,1,2)$ and $(3,1,5)$:\n\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (1-1)^2 + (5-2)^2}\\]\n\\[d = \\sqrt{9+0+9}\\]\n\\[d = \\sqrt{18}\\]\n\nSince all edges of the tetrahedron are of equal length, let's calculate the distance between the points $(4,2,1)$ and $(3,1,5)$:\n\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(3-4)^2 + (1-2)^2 + (5-1)^2}\\]\n\\[d = \\sqrt{1+1+16}\\]\n\\[d = \\sqrt{18}\\]\n\nNow that we know all edges are of equal length, let's denote this length as $s$. Since the distance between two points $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ is given by $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2}$, we can set up the following equations to represent the distances between the vertices of the tetrahedron:\n\n\\[(x_3-x_1)^2 + (y_3-y_1)^2 + (z_3-z_1)^2 = 18\\]\n\\[(x_3-x_2)^2 + (y_3-y_2)^2 + (z_3-z_2)^2 = 18\\]\n\\[(x_3-x_4)^2 + (y_3-y_4)^2 + (z_3-z_4)^2 = 18\\]\n\\[(x_4-x_2)^2 + (y_4-y_2)^2 + (z_4-z_2)^2 = 18\\]\n\\[(x_4-x_3)^2 + (y_4-y_3)^2 + (z_4-z_3)^2 = 18\\]\n\nTo reduce the number of variables, we need to set up our point, which is $(0,1,2)$ as a central node. It should have equal distances to the other three points.\n\nWe know the distance between $(0, 1, 2)$ and $(4, 2, 1)$ is $\\sqrt{18}$. Applying the distance formula on the other edges, we get another point with distance of $\\sqrt{18}$ to the first point: $(3,1,5)$. So the three points of the tetrahedron are $(0,1,2)$, $(4,2,1)$ and $(3,1,5)$.\n\nUsing these coordinates, let's consider a fourth point $(x,y,z)$. Let's set up the equations for the distance between the point $(0, 1, 2)$ and $(4, 2, 1)$, the distance between $(0, 1, 2)$ and $(3, 1, 5)$, and the distance between $(4, 2, 1)$ and $(3, 1, 5)$.\n\nThe distances are:\n\\[\\sqrt{(x-4)^2+(y-2)^2+(z-1)^2} = \\sqrt{18}\\]\n\\[\\sqrt{(x-3)^2+(y-1)^2+(z-5)^2} = \\sqrt{18}\\]\n\\[\\sqrt{(3-4)^2+(1-2)^2+(5-1)^2} = \\sqrt{18}\\]\n\nSimplifying the last equation, we know it's already true and shows no other information.\n\nWe need to simplify the other equations and then calculate the coordinates of the fourth vertex. It is difficult to proceed with the given information. Instead, let's recall the property of a regular tetrahedron - the perpendicular bisectors of any three edges intersect at the centroid, which for integer coordinates is also an integer.\n\nGiven the points $(0, 1, 2)$, $(4, 2, 1)$, and $(3, 1, 5)$, let's find the midpoint of the line segment joining $(0, 1, 2)$ and $(4,2,1)$.\n\n\\[m_1 =\\left(\\frac{0+4}{2},\\frac{1+2}{2},\\frac{2+1}{2}\\right)\\]\n\\[m_1 = (2, \\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{3}{2})\\]\n\nWe need the equation of a plane that contains the line segment with slope $m_1$, and is perpendicular to the line joining $(4, 2, 1)$ and $(3, 1, 5)$. To do that, we need a normal vector to the plane. To find it, we can use the cross product of the two vectors formed with the given points.\n\nFirst, let's find the vector from $(0,1,2)$ to $(4,2,1)$:\n\\[\\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4-0\\\\ 2-1\\\\ 1-2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1\\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nNow, let's find the vector from $(0,1,2)$ to $(3,1,5)$:\n\\[\\vec{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-0\\\\ 1-1\\\\ 5-2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3\\\\ 0\\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nThe cross product of $\\vec{v}$ and $\\vec{w}$ will give us a normal vector $\\vec{n}$ to the plane:\n\n\\[\\vec{n} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4\\\\ 1 \\\\-1\\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 3\\\\ 0\\\\ 3\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\vec{i} & \\vec{j} & \\vec{k}\\\\ 4 & 1 & -1\\\\ 3 & 0 & 3 \\end{vmatrix}\\]\n\n\\[\\vec{n} = \\begin{pmatrix}(1)(3)-(-1)(0)\\\\ (-1)(3)-(-1)(3)\\\\ (4)(0)-(1)(3)\\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\n\\[\\vec{n} = \\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\0\\\\-3\\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nTo get integer coordinates, we can scale up the normal vector $\\vec{n}$ by any factor we like.\n\nWe will use the equation of the plane with the signed distance $3\\sqrt{2}$ (since the distance between points is $\\sqrt{18}$), taking $\\vec{n} = \\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\0\\\\-3\\end{pmatrix}$  and a point $(x_1, y_1, z_1) = m_1 = (2, 3/2, 3/2)$:\n\nWe know the distance between points is $\\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWe have the normal vector $\\vec{n} = \\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\0\\\\-3\\end{pmatrix}$. \n\nAn equation of the plane is of the form $a(x-x_1)+b(y-y_1)+c(z-z_1) = 0$, where $\\begin{pmatrix}a\\\\b\\\\c\\end{pmatrix}$ is the normal vector $\\vec{n}$.\n\nWe know the distance between points is $d = 3\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{18}}{3} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{9\\cdot2}}{3} = \\sqrt{9}\\cdot\\sqrt{2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the point on the plane is:\n\n$\\sqrt{9}\\cdot\\sqrt{2} = 3\\sqrt{2} = |(x-x_1)+(\\frac{-b}{a})(y-y_1)+(\\frac{-c}{a})(z-z_1)|$\n\nUsing the point-normal form of a plane, with normal $\\vec{n} = \\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\0\\\\-3\\end{pmatrix}$  at point $(2, 3/2, 3/2)$, the equation of the plane is:\n\n\\begin{eqnarray} \n\\begin{vmatrix} \\\\ \\end{vmatrix}(x - 2) + \\begin{vmatrix} \\\\ \\end{vmatrix}(y - \\frac{3}{2}) + \\begin{vmatrix} \\\\ \\end{vmatrix}(z"
