    "To find the value of $ab$, we first need to identify the values of $a$ and $b$.\n\nLooking at the graph, we see that the period of the function is $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$. For the function $y = a \\tan bx$, the period is given by $\\frac{\\pi}{b}$. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{\\pi}{b} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}.$$\n\nSolving for $b$, we get:\n\n$$b = \\frac{3}{2}.$$\n\nNext, we need to find the value of $a$. We can do this by looking at the graph and finding the maximum or minimum value of the function. Looking at the graph, we see that the maximum value of the function is 2. Since the function is of the form $y = a \\tan bx$, the maximum value of the function is $a$. Therefore, we can conclude that $a = 2$.\n\nNow that we have found the values of $a$ and $b$, we can calculate the value of $ab$.\n\n$$ab = 2 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 3$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $ab$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "To find $ab$, we need to identify the values of $a$ and $b$ from the graph.\n\nThe graph of $y = a \\tan bx$ is a tangent function with amplitude $a$. The amplitude is the absolute value of the highest or lowest point the graph reaches above or below the center line.\n\nIn this graph, the highest point is $2$ and the lowest point is $-2$. This means that the amplitude is $2$. Since the amplitude is the absolute value of $a$, we can say that $|a| = 2$. But since $a$ is a positive constant, we know that $a = 2$.\n\nThe function $y = a \\tan bx$ has a period of $\\frac{\\pi}{|b|}$. A period is the time it takes for the function to complete one full cycle.\n\nThe graph of the function shown has three cycles from $-\\pi$ to $\\pi$. The width of the graph in the $x$-direction is $2 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$.\n\nSince the function completes three cycles in the width of the graph, we can set up the equation $\\frac{2\\pi}{3} = 3 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{|b|}$. Solving for $|b|$, we get that $|b| = \\frac{2}{3}$ is incorrect as 1 would be correct so $b = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nNow that we have the values of $a$ and $b$, we can find the product $ab$.\n\n$ab = 2 \\times \\frac{3}{2}$\n$ab = 3$\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{3}$ is the value of $ab$.",
    "To solve this problem, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the values of $a$ and $b$ from the given graph.\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that the function is in the form $y = a \\tan bx$. \n\nWe know that the general function of the tangent has the following form: $y = a \\tan b(x - c) + d$, where $c$ and $d$ are phase shift and vertical shift respectively, and $a$ and $b$ are amplitude and frequency respectively. In our case, since $d$ seems to be equal to 0, our function is $y = a \\tan bx$.\n\n2. Identify the value of $a$.\n\nLooking at the graph, we see the function passes through the point $(0,2)$. Therefore, when $x = 0$, $y = 2$. Since $a \\tan bx = 2$ at $x = 0$ and $\\tan bx = \\tan b(0) = 0$, since the function has a vertical asymptote at x = 0 and the graph changes direction from positive to negative or vice versa at x = 0.\n\nHowever if we look closely, since we are interested in $x = 0$ we look for $b \\cdot 0 = 0.$ Then since we know that $y = a \\tan bx$, $a \\tan(0) = 2.$ Since $\\tan 0 = 0$ we now have 0 * a = 2, so this expression cannot be true. But we can deduce the following expression: $y = a \\tan bx$, and $\\tan 0 = \\tan b(0) = 0$, and if a function of the form $y = a \\tan b(x - c) + d$ is shifted and it has a period $p$, its general function of period $p$ will be of the form $y = a \\tan b(x - c) + d.$ We know this, but since this function is in the form of $y = a \\tan bx$ we can say $a \\tan bx = 2$, then we can rewrite the equation as  $a \\tan bx = a \\tan b(0) = a \\tan 0.$ We know $\\tan 0 = 0$, then we now have $a \\cdot 0 = 2$, however we know from the equation $\\tan b \\left(x - c \\right) = a$, if the equation $\\tan b \\left(x - c \\right) = a$, if $x$ is in the domain of the function, then the function $y = \\tan b \\left(x - c \\right) + d$, has period $\\frac{\\pi}{b}$, since $\\tan b \\left(x - c \\right) = a.$ In our case, since we have this equation $a \\tan bx = 2$, we can say the answer to the equation is $c = 0$, in the equation $y = a \\tan b(x - c) + d.$ This is because since we want to know the value of $a$ we look for a non-perceptible shift, or if the value of $x$ is not important. Since we look for the value of $a$, we look at the value of the function at some value of $x$. If we look at some value of $x$, $a \\tan bx = 2.$ This is the same as saying $a \\tan b \\left(x - c \\right) = a.$ Here, we can see this expression has no effect on the value of $a$, or is 0. We can say the value of $b$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{p}$ where $p$ is the period of the function. \n\nBut we know that since the function $y = a \\tan bx$ is of the period $\\frac{\\pi}{b}$ since we know the value of $c$ is 0. This is because since the period of the function is $T = \\frac{ \\pi}{b}$, and $c = 0$, then the function is of the form $y = a \\tan bx.$\n\nWe see that when $x$ = $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ the function equals $2$, if the value of $b$ changes the value of $f \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right)$. Therefore $f \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) = 0.$ This is because since we know the period of the function $y=a \\tan bx$, is $\\frac{\\pi}{b}$ we know this function is equal to $\\tan bx$, we have seen that $\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\tan bx \\right) = b \\sec^2 bx$, then we have $\\tan b\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) = \\tan b \\left( \\frac{b \\pi}{b} \\right) = \\tan b \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{1} \\right) = \\tan \\left(b\\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{1} \\right) \\left( 2k\\pi + 2 \\right).$ Since $ \\tan \\left(b\\right) k\\pi = 0$, if $k$ is any integer. We know this since we know the general equation of $\\tan x$ is of the type $ \\tan x = \\tan \\left( a \\left(x - \\omega \\right) \\right) = \\left[ \\tan \\left(x \\right) \\right]_{\\omega}. $ Therefore we have, $f \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) = 0.$\n\nWe see that if $ a \\left(x - \\omega \\right)$ is of the form $\\tan \\left(x \\right) = a \\left(x - \\omega \\right)$ we have that since $y = a \\tan bx,$ when x is at this point we have that y is maximized. We can say that this is the maximum of the function, we can say that if the tan of a value of $x$ that is in the domain of the function is a multiple of $\\pi$ we know that $y = 0$, if $x = n\\pi.$"
