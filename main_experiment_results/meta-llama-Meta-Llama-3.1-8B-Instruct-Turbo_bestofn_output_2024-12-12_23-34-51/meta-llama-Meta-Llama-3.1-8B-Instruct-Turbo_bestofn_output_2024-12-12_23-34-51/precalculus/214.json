    "To find the number of $x$-intercepts on the graph of $y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x}$ in the interval $(0.0001, 0.001)$, we need to find the values of $x$ that make $\\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0$.\n\nThe sine function is $0$ at integer multiples of $\\pi$, so we need to find the values of $x$ that satisfy $\\frac{1}{x} = k\\pi$ for some integer $k$.\n\nRearranging the equation, we get $x = \\frac{1}{k\\pi}$. Since $x$ must be in the interval $(0.0001, 0.001)$, we can set up the inequality:\n\n$0.0001 < \\frac{1}{k\\pi} < 0.001$\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n$\\frac{1}{0.001} > k\\pi > \\frac{1}{0.0001}$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$1000 > k\\pi > 10,000$\n\nTo find the possible values of $k$, we can divide both sides by $\\pi$ and round up and down to the nearest integer:\n\n$\\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.33 < k < \\frac{10,000}{\\pi} \\approx 3184.84$\n\nSo, the possible values of $k$ are $319, 320, \\ldots, 3184$.\n\nThe final answer is then $\\boxed{2866}$.",

    "To find the number of $x$-intercepts on the graph of $y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x}$ in the interval $(0.0001, 0.001)$, we need to find the values of $x$ at which $\\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0$.\n\nThe function $\\sin \\frac{1}{x}$ has an $x$-intercept when $\\frac{1}{x} = k\\pi$, where $k$ is a nonzero integer. This is because $\\sin \\theta = 0$ when $\\theta$ is an integer multiple of $\\pi$. \n\nSo, we need to find the number of values of $k$ for which $\\frac{1}{x}$ is between $0.0001\\pi$ and $0.001\\pi$.\n\nTo find the range of $k$, we can first convert the given interval into the following form:\n$$0.0001\\pi < \\frac{1}{x} < 0.001\\pi$$\n\nNow, let's find the range of the reciprocal of $x$ in the interval $(0.0001,0.001)$.\n\nThe reciprocal of lower limit $(0.0001)$ can be written as $\\frac{1}{0.0001}$ which can be written as $\\frac{100000}{1}$. \n\nThe reciprocal of upper limit $(0.001)$ can be written as $\\frac{1}{0.001}$  which can be written as $1000$.\n\nNow that we have the range, we have this: $\\frac{100000}{1} < \\frac{1}{x} < 1000.$\n\nWe want to find the number of values of $k$ for which $\\frac{1}{x}$ is between $\\frac{100000}{1}$ and $1000$, and we know that $\\frac{1}{x} = k\\pi$.\n\nTo find this range in terms of $k$, we can divide the range by $\\pi$: $\\frac{100000}{\\pi} < k < \\frac{1000}{\\pi}$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the bounds. We have $\\frac{100000}{\\pi}\\approx 31831.55$, and $\\frac{1000}{\\pi}\\approx 318.31$.\n\nWe are now looking for the number of integers between $31831.55$ and $318.31$. Since the number of integers between $31831.55$ and $318.31$ is what will tell us the number of $x$-intercepts, we can subtract and round down to our lower value which would be $31831$. The number of integers between $31831.55$ and $318.31$ has to be found in terms of $\\lfloor 31831 \\rfloor - \\lceil 318.31 \\rceil$. Let's evaluate that to get the final answer.\n\nCount of integer interval $318$ is $(31831-318)=\\boxed{31813}$."
