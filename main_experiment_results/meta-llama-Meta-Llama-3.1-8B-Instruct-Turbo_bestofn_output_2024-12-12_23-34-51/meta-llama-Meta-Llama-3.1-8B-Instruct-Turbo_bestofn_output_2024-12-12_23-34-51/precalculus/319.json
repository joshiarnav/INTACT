    "To find the distance from vertex $A$ to the plane, we first need to find the equation of the plane. \n\nWe can use the three vertices adjacent to vertex $A$ to find the equation of the plane. Let's assume the base point of our coordinate system is at the vertex $A$. The other 3 vertices that are adjacent to that point are located at (10, 0, 0), (0, 10, 0), and (0, 0, 10).\n\nNow, we need to find the equation of the plane in the form $ax + by + cz + d = 0$.\nThe equation of the plane is given by \n$\\frac{x}{a} + \\frac{y}{b} + \\frac{z}{c} = 1.$\nWe also know that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1.$\n\nNow the equation of the plane through points $(10, 0, 0)$, $(0, 10, 0)$, and $(0, 0, 10)$ may be expressed as \n\n$\\frac{x}{10} + \\frac{y}{10} + \\frac{z}{10} = 1.$\n\nSince we want the plane in the form $ax + by + cz + d = 0$, we rearrange the above equation to get \n$10x + 10y + 10z - 100 = 0.$\n\nThe general equation of a plane is given by $ax+by+cz+d=0$. Therefore, the equation of the given plane in the required form is \n$10x + 10y + 10z - 100 = 0.$\n\nHowever, we are interested in finding the distance of vertex $A$, which is the origin of our coordinate system (0, 0, 0) from this plane. Therefore the value of $d$ in the plane equation is the distance we're looking for.\n\nTo find the value of $d$, we first need to express the plane equation in the required form $ax + by + cz + d = 0$. Since the general equation of a plane is \n$ax+by+cz+d=0.$\n\nHere we know that $ax+by+cz+d=0$. After simplifying the equation we get  $10x+10y+10z-100=0$. Let's see what values of $a, b$ and $c$ are. Since $10x+10y+10z+d=0$. \n\nHence we get, \n$a = 10, b = 10,$ and $c=10$.\n\nThe equation of the plane becomes, $10x + 10y + 10z + d = 0.$\n\nNow let's substitute these values into $ax+by+cz+d = 0$ to get the value of $d$. We get \n$d = 100.$\n\nThe distance of the plane from the point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is given by the formula\n$\\left| \\frac{d - ax_0 - by_0 - cz_0}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} \\right|.$\n\nSince the point of interest is at (0, 0, 0), \nthe distance becomes \n$\\left| \\frac{100}{\\sqrt{10^2+10^2+10^2}} \\right|.$\n\nWe know that \n$\\left| \\frac{100}{\\sqrt{10^2+10^2+10^2}} \\right|$\n$ = \\left| \\frac{100}{\\sqrt{300}} \\right|$\n$= \\frac{100}{\\sqrt{100*3}}$\n$= \\frac{100}{10\\sqrt{3}}$\n$=\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n$=\\frac{10\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{3}}$\n$= \\frac{10\\sqrt{3}}{3}$\n\nThe value of $r$ is 10, the value of $s$ is $3*3 = 9$ and the value of $t$ is 3. \n\nWe know that the sum of the values of $r$, $s$ and $t$ will be $r+s+t$. Therefore, the sum of values of $r$, $s$ and $t$ will be $10 + 9 + 3$. \n\nFinally, $10 + 9 + 3 = 22.$\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{22}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we'll first set up the given information in a coordinate system.\n\nWe have a cube with side length 10 and a vertex labeled $A$ closest to the plane. The three vertices adjacent to vertex $A$ are at heights 10, 11, and 12 above the plane.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we can place point $A$ at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$, and the three vertices adjacent to it at $(10,0,0)$, $(0,10,0)$, and $(0,0,10)$. The equation of the plane can be expressed as:\n\n$$\\frac{x}{10}+\\frac{y}{10}+\\frac{z}{b} = 1,$$ where $b$ is the distance from the point $A$ to the plane.\n\nWe're also given that the point $(10, 0, 0)$ lies on the plane. Plugging this into the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{10}{10}+\\frac{0}{10}+\\frac{0}{b}=1$$ \n\nSince we have \n$\\frac{1}{1}$ = 1. Thus the equation above is \ntrue for any number chosen for  b,  except we are also given that \nthe point $(0,10,0)$ also lies on the plane. This means that\n$\\frac{0}{10}+\\frac{10}{10}+\\frac{0}{b}=1$ so this also verifies \nour form. However, the point $(0,0,10)$ must also be the plane.\nThis can be shown by using the equation and the fact that $(0,0,10)$\nis on the plane: $$\\frac{0}{10}+\\frac{0}{10}+\\frac{10}{b} = 1,$$\n$$10/b=1.$$\n\nSolving for $b$, we get:\n\n$$b= 10.$$\n\nHowever we need to use a correct method to find  b. This\nmeans setting up an equation to use the distance from the plane\nto the three points of given height, which forms \nan equation of the distance between a point and a plane:\n\n$$\\frac{|Ax+By+Cz+D|}{\\sqrt{A^2+B^2+C^2}}.$$The  numerator\n$Ax+By+Cz+D$ is derived from the equation $Ax+By+Cz+D = 0$ of\nthe plane given by:\n\n$$Ax+By+Cz+D=0,$$ And the plane given is \n\n$\\frac{x}{10}+\\frac{y}{10}+\\frac{z}{10}=1$, \nThis means multiplying both sides by 10 to get \n$x+10y+10z = 100$.

This will make: $\\frac{| 1\\cdot10+10\\cdot0+10\\cdot0+D|}{\\sqrt{1^2+10^2+10^2}}$.\nWe can make\n$110/11 = |D+100|/sqrt{1+100+100}$ \nThis means $110/\\sqrt{1+100+100} = |D+100|/\\sqrt{221}$.\n\nHowever \n$D$ is given by 100 minus $\\frac{x}{10}+\\frac{y}{10}+\\frac{z}{10}$ from the equation $\\frac{x}{10}+\\frac{y}{10}+\\frac{z}{10}=1$ state; $x$, $y$ and $z$ will be 0 \nbecause we're at the point $(10, 0, 0)$;  Thus $\\frac{x}{10}+\\frac{y}{10}+\\frac{z}{10}$  turns  to be  $\\frac{0}{10}+\\frac{0}{10}+\\frac{0}{10}$ \nwhich is  $0$ since $(0 + 0 + 0)$ is $(0$)  to turn this to\n$\\frac{x}{10}+\\frac{y}{10}+\\frac{z}{10}$  is to  $0$. As a state from\nthe plane equation  $\\frac{x}{10}+\\frac{y}{10}+\\frac{z}{10}$ = 1 turns\n$0 + 100 = 100.$ \nThis also turns\n$\\frac{| 110|}{\\sqrt{221}} = |\\frac{ 100 + D}{\\sqrt{221}}| =  | \\frac{ 100}{\\sqrt{ 221}}+ D /  \\sqrt{221}|$.\nwhich means 110 / \\sqrt{221}  =  100 / \\sqrt{221} + D / \\sqrt{221}\nto solve for  D just subtract: $\\frac{100}{\\sqrt{221}}$ on both sides \nto turn:\n$\\frac{110}{\\sqrt{221}}-\\frac{100}{\\sqrt{221}} = D/\\sqrt{221}$.\nto cancel  $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt221}$ gives $\\frac{ 10}{\\sqrt221}=D/\\sqrt221$.\n$\\frac{10}{\\sqrt221}$ =  $D/\\sqrt221.

    "To solve this problem, we can set up a coordinate system with the vertices adjacent to $A$ at $(10,0,0)$, $(0,10,0)$, and $(0,0,10)$.\n\nThen, we have the equation of the plane as $ax+by+cz+d=0$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are constants. \n\nThe distance from a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ to the plane is $\\frac{|ax_0+by_0+cz_0+d|}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}$. \n\nIn particular, the distance from the origin to the plane is $d$.\n\nTherefore, the distance from $A$ to the plane is $\\frac{d}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}$, which we can express as $\\frac{r-\\sqrt{s}}{t}$.\n\nTo get the constants, substituting the vertices into the equation of the plane gives three equations: \n$a+10b+d=0$, $10a+b+c+d=0$, and $10a+10b+c+d=0$.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation gives $9a-9b=0$, or $a=b$.\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the third equation gives $a+b=0$, so $a+b=0$ and $a=b=0$ or $a=-b$.\n\nHowever, $a=0$ and $b=0$ will make the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of the plane nonexistent, so $a=-b$.\n\nSubstituting $a=-b$ into the second equation gives $-10a+11a+c+d=0$.

  "model_solution": "$\\boxed{To solve this problem, we'll first set up the given information in a coordinate system.\n\nWe have a cube with side length 10 and a vertex labeled $A$ closest to the plane. The three vertices adjacent to vertex $A$ are at heights 10, 11, and 12 above the plane.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we can place point $A$ at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$, and the three vertices adjacent to it at $(10,0,0)$, $(0,10,0)$, and $(0,0,10)$. The equation of the plane can be expressed as:\n\n$$\\frac{x}{10}+\\frac{y}{10}+\\frac{z}{b} = 1,$$ where $b$ is the distance from the point $A$ to the plane.\n\nWe're also given that the point $(10, 0, 0)$ lies on the plane. Plugging this into the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{10}{10}+\\frac{0}{10}+\\frac{0}{b}=1$$ \n\nSince we have \n$\\frac{1}{1}$ = 1. Thus the equation above is \ntrue for any number chosen for  b,  except we are also given that \nthe point $(0,10,0)$ also lies on the plane. This means that\n$\\frac{0}{10}+\\frac{10}{10}+\\frac{0}{b}=1$ so this also verifies \nour form. However, the point $(0,0,10)$ must also be the plane.\nThis can be shown by using the equation and the fact that $(0,0,10)$\nis on the plane: $$\\frac{0}{10}+\\frac{0}{10}+\\frac{10}{b} = 1,$$\n$$10/b=1.$$\n\nSolving for $b$, we get:\n\n$$b= 10.$$\n\nHowever we need to use a correct method to find  b. This\nmeans setting up an equation to use the distance from the plane\nto the three points of given height, which forms \nan equation of the distance between a point and a plane:\n\n$$\\frac{|Ax+By+Cz+D|}{\\sqrt{A^2+B^2+C^2}}.$$The  numerator\n$Ax+By+Cz+D$ is derived from the equation $Ax+By+Cz+D = 0$ of\nthe plane given by:\n\n$$Ax+By+Cz+D=0,$$ And the plane given is \n\n$\\frac{x}{10}+\\frac{y}{10}+\\frac{z}{10}=1$, \nThis means multiplying both sides by 10 to get \n$x+10y+10z = 100$. And state that $A$, $B$, $C$ are 1, \n10, and 10  respectively; $A$, $B$ ,$C$ \nare just parts in this chosen $\\frac{x}{10}+\\frac{y}{10}+\n\\frac{z}{10}=1$. However the point $(10, 0, 0)$ is given \nto be on the plane. This will make: $\\frac{| 1\\cdot10+10\\cdot0+10\\cdot0+D|}{\\sqrt{1^2+10^2+10^2}}$.\nWe can make\n$110/11 = |D+100|/sqrt{1+100+100}$ \nThis means $110/\\sqrt{1+100+100} = |D+100|/\\sqrt{221}$.\n\nHowever \n$D$ is given by 100 minus $\\frac{x}{10}+\\frac{y}{10}+\\frac{z}{10}$ from the equation $\\frac{x}{10}+\\frac{y}{10}+\\frac{z}{10}=1$ state; $x$, $y$ and $z$ will be 0 \nbecause we're at the point $(10, 0, 0)$;  Thus $\\frac{x}{10}+\\frac{y}{10}+\\frac{z}{10}$  turns  to be  $\\frac{0}{10}+\\frac{0}{10}+\\frac{0}{10}$ \nwhich is  $0$ since $(0 + 0 + 0)$ is $(0$)  to turn this to\n$\\frac{x}{10}+\\frac{y}{10}+\\frac{z}{10}$  is to  $0$. As a state from\nthe plane equation  $\\frac{x}{10}+\\frac{y}{10}+\\frac{z}{10}$ = 1 turns\n$0 + 100 = 100.$ \nThis also turns\n$\\frac{| 110|}{\\sqrt{221}} = |\\frac{ 100 + D}{\\sqrt{221}}| =  | \\frac{ 100}{\\sqrt{ 221}}+ D /  \\sqrt{221}|$.\nwhich means 110 / \\sqrt{221}  =  100 / \\sqrt{221} + D / \\sqrt{221}\nto solve for  D just subtract: $\\frac{100}{\\sqrt{221}}$ on both sides \nto turn:\n$\\frac{110}{\\sqrt{221}}-\\frac{100}{\\sqrt{221}} = D/\\sqrt{221}$.\nto cancel  $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt221}$ gives $\\frac{ 10}{\\sqrt221}=D/\\sqrt221$.\n$\\frac{10}{\\sqrt221}$ =  $D/\\sqrt221. Thus $D = \\frac{100}{\\sqrt{221}}.$\nThus on the plane equation  $Ax+By+Cz+D = 0$ the numerator turns\n$1\\cdot10+10\\cdot0+10\\cdot0+D = 100+D$.\n$100 + D =\n100 + \\frac{ 100}{\\sqrt{221}} =  $\\frac{100\\sqrt221+100}{\\sqrt221}$.\nThe last equation is written so to correct the format:\n$$\\frac{100\\sqrt221+100}{\\sqrt221}$$.\nIt can be simplified;  To simplify this write: $$\\frac{100(\\sqrt221) +\n100}{\\sqrt221}$$ which can be\nwritten as \n$\\frac{ 100 \\sqrt{221+ \\frac{100}{\\sqrt{221}  }}}{\\sqrt221}$.\n 100\n$ on the\nnumerator can be written as $$ 100 \\cdot \\sqrt{221+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{221}}}$$ to\nmultiply $\\frac{\\sqrt221}{\\sqrt221}$ with  $\\sqrt221$,  a bit\ninverse of the given problem; root multiplied with\n a root  is  the Root^2 $\\sqrt221 \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt221}{\\sqrt221}$\n\n\n$=\\frac{\\sqrt 221\\cdot  \\sqrt {221+ \\frac 1{\\sqrt{221}}   }  }{\\sqrt221}$.\n$ =  \\sqrt{221+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{221}}}$\nThus the numerator  $Ax+By+Cz+D = 100+D$  $ =  \\sqrt{221+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{221}}} $ to return to the\nequation \n$ \\frac{|\\frac{x}{10}+ \\frac{y}{10}+ \\frac{z}{10}+ D|} {\\sqrt{1+ 100 +100}} $ =\n $\\frac{| \\sqrt  {221 + \\frac {1}{\\sqrt  {221} }} |}{ \\sqrt {221 }}  $ the  numerator written \nthe correct way\nis not to  just make an extra\n$|$.
