  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. They all correctly calculate the dot product of the direction vectors and set it equal to zero to find the value of $a$ for which the lines are perpendicular. The value of $a$ that makes the two lines perpendicular is indeed $a = 1$.\n\nHowever, Solution 1 is the most concise and straightforward. It directly calculates the dot product and sets it equal to zero, without unnecessary steps or explanations.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1.
