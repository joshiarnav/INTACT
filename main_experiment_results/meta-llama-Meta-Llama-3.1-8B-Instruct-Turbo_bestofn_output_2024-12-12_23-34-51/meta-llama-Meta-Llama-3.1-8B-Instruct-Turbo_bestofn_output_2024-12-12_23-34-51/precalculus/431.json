    "To convert the point from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the radius $r$ and the angle $\\theta$.\n\n**Step 1: Find the radius $r$**\n\nWe use the formula:\n$r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$\nwhere $x = \\sqrt{2}$ and $y = -\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n$r = \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{2})^2 + (-\\sqrt{2})^2}$\n$r = \\sqrt{2 + 2}$\n$r = \\sqrt{4}$\n$r = 2$\n\n**Step 2: Find the angle $\\theta$**\n\nWe use the formula:\n$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$\nwhere $x = \\sqrt{2}$ and $y = -\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nHowever, we need to be careful with the signs of $x$ and $y$ to determine the correct quadrant for the angle $\\theta$.\n\nSince $x > 0$ and $y < 0$, we are in the fourth quadrant.\n\n$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{-\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$\n$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(-1)$\n$\\theta = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}$\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$. Since $\\theta = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ is in the fourth quadrant and is the correct angle, we can add $2\\pi$ to it and take the result modulo $2\\pi$. In this case, the easiest approach is to add $2\\pi$.\n\n$\\theta = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} + 2\\pi$\n$\\theta = \\frac{7\\pi}{4}$\n\nHowever, this is equivalent to the angle found above.\n\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are:\n$(r, \\theta) = \\boxed{\\left(2, \\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\right)}$.",
    "To convert the point $(\\sqrt{2}, -\\sqrt{2})$ from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we'll need to calculate the radius ($r$) and the angle ($\\theta$).\n\n1. **Calculate the radius (r):**\nThe radius is given by the formula $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, where $(x, y)$ are the rectangular coordinates of the point.\nIn this case, $x = \\sqrt{2}$ and $y = -\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo, $r = \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{2})^2 + (-\\sqrt{2})^2}$\n$r = \\sqrt{2 + 2}$\n$r = \\sqrt{4}$\n$r = 2$\n\n2. **Calculate the angle ($\\theta$):**\nTo find the angle $\\theta$, we can use the formula $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$.\nIn this case, $y = -\\sqrt{2}$ and $x = \\sqrt{2}$.\nSo, $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{-\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$\n$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(-1)$\nSince we know that $\\tan(-45^\\circ) = -1$, we can say that $\\theta = -45^\\circ$.\n\nHowever, we want $\\theta$ in the range $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$.\nTo do this, we can add $2\\pi$ to $\\theta$ and still be in the correct range.\nBut, we can simply note that we're in the fourth quadrant, where the x coordinate is positive and the y coordinate is negative.\nTherefore, we can also just add $\\pi$ to $\\theta$.\nSo, $\\theta = -45^\\circ + 180^\\circ = 135^\\circ$.\n\nSince we want our angle in radians, we can convert $135^\\circ$ to radians by multiplying by $\\frac{\\pi}{180^\\circ}$.\n$\\theta = 135^\\circ \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180^\\circ}$\n$\\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{4}$\n\nTherefore, the polar coordinates of the point are $\\boxed{\\left(2,\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right)}$.",
    "To convert the point from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we use the following formulas:\n\n$r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ (for the radius) \n$\\theta = \\text{atan2}(y, x)$ (for the angle, where atan2 is the two-argument arctangent function to find the correct angle in all four quadrants)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx &= \\sqrt{2} \\\\\ny &= - \\sqrt{2} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLet's plug these values into the formula for the radius $r$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nr &= \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{2} )^2 + ( -\\sqrt{2} )^2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{2 + 2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{4} \\\\\n&= 2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow, let's find the angle $\\theta$.
