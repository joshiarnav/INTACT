    "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that all the roots of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity, we can start by rewriting the given equation.\n\nThe original equation can be rewritten as $(z^2)^2 - z^2 + 1 = 0$, which is a quadratic equation in terms of $z^2$. Let's substitute $x = z^2$ to simplify the equation.\n\nNow, the equation becomes $x^2 - x + 1 = 0$. \n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we can find the roots of this equation as follows:\n\n$$x = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}$$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n$$x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$$\n\nSince we let $x = z^2$, we can now substitute this back to find the values of $z$. \n\nWe have $z^2 = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$. This implies that $z^2 = \\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. \n\nThese are the square roots of the complex numbers $\\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The complex numbers $\\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ can also be written in the form $e^{\\pm i\\pi/3}$ using Euler's formula. \n\nIn other words, $\\frac{1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2} = e^{i\\pi/3}$ and $\\frac{1 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2} = e^{-i\\pi/3}$.\n\nNow, note that the square roots of $e^{\\pm i\\pi/3}$ are the $12^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity. This is because the sum of the angles of the $12^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity is equal to $2\\pi$, and taking the square roots of the complex numbers results in doubling the angles, from $\\pm i\\pi/3$ to $\\pm 2i\\pi/3$.",
    "To solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rewrite the equation**: The given equation is a quartic equation in terms of $z^2$. Let's denote $y = z^2$. Now the equation becomes $y^2 - y + 1 = 0$. \n\n2. **Find the roots of the equation in $y$**: We can use the quadratic formula, which is $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, in this case, $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = 1$.\n\n   Substituting the values, we get:\n   $$\n   y = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}.\n   $$\n\n   We see that both roots of the equation in $y$ are complex numbers, which can be expressed in terms of the imaginary unit $i$.\n\n   Since $\\sqrt{-3} = i\\sqrt{3}$, the roots become:\n   $$\n   y_1 = \\frac{1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y_2 = \\frac{1 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2}.\n   $$\n\n3. **Find the roots of the equation in $z$**: Recall that we denoted $y = z^2$. We can express the roots of the equation in $z$ as the square roots of the roots in $y$.\n\n   Thus, we can write the roots in $z$ as:\n   $$\n   z_{1, 2} = \\pm \\sqrt{y_{1, 2}}.\n   $$\n\n   Substituting the values of $y_1$ and $y_2$, we get:\n   $$\n   z_{1, 2} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}}.\n   $$\n\n   We can simplify $\\sqrt{\\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$ as $\\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is of the form $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) \\pm i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$, but as it is $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$ or $e^{i\\frac{5\\pi}{3}}$ that matches the cosine, we can simplify the above as:\n\n   $$\\sqrt{\\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}^\\frac{1}{2} = e^\\frac{i\\pi}{6} \\text{ or } e^\\frac{-i\\pi}{6}$$\n\n   To find the 12th roots of unity as specified,   the solution involves $e^\\frac{i\\pi}{6}$ or $e^\\frac{-i\\pi}{6}$ both of these values can be found by solving for the term  $e^\\frac{i2\\pi}{12}$ as that represents the 12th root of unity.\n\n   Now we can say that the smallest positive integer $n$ such that all of the roots of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity is 12.\n\n   So, the answer is $\\boxed{12}.$",
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation and find a connection between it and the roots of unity.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the equation as:\n\\[z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0\\]\n\nLet's try to make a substitution to simplify this equation. We'll use $u = z^2$:\n\\[u^2 - u + 1 = 0\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of $u$. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\\[u = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\nHere, $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = 1$. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\\[u = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1}}{2 \\cdot 1}\\]\n\\[u = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4}}{2}\\]\n\\[u = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}\\]\n\nNow, we have two possible values of $u$. Since $u = \\sqrt{z^2} = |z|$, we can express them as complex numbers:\n\\[u_1 = \\frac{1}{|z|} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2|z|}\\]\n\\[u_2 = \\frac{1}{|z|} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2|z|}\\]\n\nBut we can't just divide by a complex number, we must also have a denominator. For division we use a denominator that can easily be identified once we express a complex number in polar form. (Note that assuming we 'have' 2 complex numbers without assuming we know how we got them assuming specific roots in the resultant expressions without doing such we later chance finding roots in the resultant expressions once again a complementary definition).\n\nNow let's transform the equation with an identity for complex $n^{\\text{th}}$ root for any real $k$.
