    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the vector from the center of dilation to the point $2i$. \nThis is done by subtracting the center of dilation from the point $2i$: $(2i) - (-1 + 4i) = 2i + 1 - 4i = 1 - 2i$.\n\n2. Multiply this vector by the scale factor, $-2$. This is done by multiplying both the real and imaginary parts by $-2$: $(-2) \\cdot (1 - 2i) = -2 + 4i$.\n\n3. Find the image of $2i$ after the dilation by adding the result of the scaled vector to the center of dilation: $(-1 + 4i) + (-2 + 4i) = -3 + 8i$.\n\nTherefore, after dilation with a scale factor of $-2$ centered at $-1+4i$, the image of $2i$ is $\\boxed{-3 + 8i}$.",

  "critique": "The best solution is solution 1.\n\nSolution 1 is the most accurate and correct solution. It correctly follows the steps of finding the vector from the center of dilation to the point, multiplying the vector by the scale factor, and adding the result to the center of dilation. The final answer is $\\boxed{-3 + 8i}$, which is correct.\n\nSolution 2 is almost identical to Solution 1 and is also correct.\n\nSolution 3, however, has an error in the dilation step. When multiplying the vector by the scale factor, it incorrectly simplifies to $1 + 4i$ instead of $-2 + 4i$. This results in a final answer of $0 + 8i$, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1.",
