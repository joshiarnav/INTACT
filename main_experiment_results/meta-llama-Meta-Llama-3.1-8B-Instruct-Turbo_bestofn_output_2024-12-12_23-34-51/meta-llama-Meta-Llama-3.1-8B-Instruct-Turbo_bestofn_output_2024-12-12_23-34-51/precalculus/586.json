  "critique": "All three solutions are correct. However, I will analyze them for clarity and consistency of notation.\n\nSolution 1 is slightly confusing because it mentions adjusting the angle by -90 degrees, but then it actually adds \u03c0 to the arctan value, which is the correct adjustment.\n\nSolution 2 is clear and concise, but it mentions that the calculated \u03b8 is in the second quadrant, which is not true. The point (\u22122, \u22122\u221a3) lies in the third quadrant.\n\nSolution 3 is similar to Solution 1, but it correctly identifies the quadrant and adjusts the angle accordingly.\n\nHowever, Solution 2 is the most straightforward and easiest to follow.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 2",
