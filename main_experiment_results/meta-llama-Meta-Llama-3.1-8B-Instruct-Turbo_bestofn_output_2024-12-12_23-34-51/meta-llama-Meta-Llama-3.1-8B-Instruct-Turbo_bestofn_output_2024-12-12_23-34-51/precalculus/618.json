    "To find the equation of the plane that passes through points $(-1,1,1)$ and $(1,-1,1),$ we need a normal vector to the plane. \n\nSince the given plane $x + 2y + 3z = 5$ has a normal vector of $<1, 2, 3>$ and the new plane is perpendicular to the given plane, the new plane's normal vector will be parallel to the given plane. Therefore, the normal vector to the new plane is also $<1, 2, 3>$.\n\nHowever, we need another vector in the plane. Using the two points, we get the vector $<1 - (-1), -1 - 1, 1 - 1>=<2, -2, 0>$. \n\nTo get the normal vector of the desired plane, we need to take the cross product of $<1, 2, 3>$ and $<2, -2, 0>$.\n\nThe cross product is calculated as:\n\n$<1, 2, 3> \\times <2, -2, 0>$ =  $\\begin{vmatrix}\n         i & j & k\\\\\n         1 & 2 & 3\\\\\n         2 & -2 & 0\n          \\end{vmatrix}$\n\n$= (2 \\cdot 0 - 3 \\cdot (-2))i - (1 \\cdot 0 - 3 \\cdot 2)j + (-2 \\cdot 2 -1\\cdot -2)k$\n\n$= (0 + 6)i - 0j + (-4 + 2)k$\n\n$= 6i + 0j - 2k$\n\n$= <6, 0, -2>$\n\nNow we have the normal vector of the desired plane as $<6, 0, -2>$.\n\nTo find the equation of the plane, we know that the normal vector to the plane is $<A, B, C>$ and the general form of the equation of the plane is $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0$. \n\nUsing the point-normal form of the equation of a plane, the equation of the plane passing through point $(-1,1,1)$ with normal vector $<6, 0, -2>$ can be written as:\n\n$6(x - (-1)) + 0(y - 1) -2(z - 1) = 0$\n\nExpanding the equation we get:\n\n$6x + 6 - 2z + 2 = 0$\n\n$6x - 2z + 8 = 0$\n\nDividing the equation by the smallest integer factor (which is 2), we get:\n\n$3x - z + 4 = 0$\n\nThe equation of the plane is $\\boxed{3x - z + 4 = 0}$.",
    "To find the equation of the plane passing through the given points and perpendicular to the given plane, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find a normal vector to the given plane:\n\nThe equation of the given plane is $x + 2y + 3z = 5.$ The coefficients of $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ in the equation give the components of a normal vector to the plane. Therefore, a normal vector to the given plane is:\n\n$\\vec{n_1} = (1, 2, 3)$\n\nSince the plane we are looking for is perpendicular to this given plane, it will be parallel to this plane. Hence, the normal vector of the required plane will be parallel to the given plane.\n\n2. Find a normal vector to the required plane:\n\nSince the required plane has to be parallel to the given plane, it must have a normal vector that is parallel (or proportional) to the normal vector of the given plane. However, to be perpendicular, the required plane's normal cannot be the same as given plane's normal but will have it as a component.\n\n Let's find a normal vector $\\vec{n_2}$ to the required plane by taking a vector in the plane $x + 2y + 3z = 5$ and then taking the cross product with $\\vec{n_1}$.\n\n A simple vector in the plane $x + 2y + 3z = 5$ can be taken by picking a point on the plane, such as the origin, and finding a vector from the origin to another point on the plane. We can then find a vector from $(-1,1,1)$ to $(1,-1,1)$ which is:\n\n$\\vec{p} = (1 - (-1), -1 - 1, 1 - 1) = (2, -2, 0)$\n\nNow we take the cross product of $\\vec{p}$ with $\\vec{n_1}$:\n\n$\\vec{n_2} = \\vec{p} \\times \\vec{n_1} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k} \\\\\n2 & -2 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix}$\n\n$\\vec{n_2} = ( (-2)(3) - (0)(2), (0)(1) - (2)(3), (2)(2) - (-2)(1))$\n\n$\\vec{n_2} = (-6, -6, 6)$\n\nThis normal vector has the same direction as $(1,-1,0)$ (after dividing by the greatest common factor), which simplifies to:\n\n$\\vec{n_2} = (1,-1,0)$\n\nHowever, since the question asks us to make the answer in such a way that it does not reduce to the integer coordinates with the numerator being $1$, we have our answer.\n\n3.

    "To find the equation of the plane, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find a normal vector to the plane we are trying to find the equation for (let's call this the target plane).\n2. Use the normal vector and one of the points given to find the equation in the form $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0$.\n\nFirst, let's find a vector that lies on the target plane. We have two points $(-1,1,1)$ and $(1,-1,1)$. The vector between these two points will lie on the target plane.\n\nThe vector between these two points is\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(1 - (-1), -1 - 1, 1 - 1) &= (2, -2, 0) \\\\\n&= 2\\mathbf{i} - 2\\mathbf{j}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThis is a vector that lies on the target plane.\n\nNow, we need to find a normal vector to the target plane. We know that the target plane is perpendicular to the plane $x + 2y + 3z = 5$. The equation $x + 2y + 3z = 5$ tells us that the normal vector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nSince the target plane is perpendicular to the plane $x + 2y + 3z = 5$, a normal vector to the target plane is perpendicular to the normal vector of the other plane, $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$. Therefore, a normal vector to the target plane is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$. Using the cross product formula, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}\n&= \\begin{pmatrix} ( (-2)\\cdot 3 - 0\\cdot 2) \\\\ (0\\cdot 1 - 2\\cdot 3) \\\\ (2\\cdot 2 - (-2)\\cdot 1) \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n&= \\begin{pmatrix} -6 \\\\ -6 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can simplify this by dividing by $-6$. Therefore, a normal vector to the target plane is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nLet's use the point-normal form of a plane to find the equation of the target plane. The formula for the point-normal form is $A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) = 0$, where $\\begin{pmatrix} A \\\\ B \\\\ C \\end{pmatrix}$ is the normal vector and $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is a point on the plane.\n\nWe have a normal vector of $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Let's use the point $(-1, 1, 1)$ as the point on the plane.\n\nUsing the point-normal form, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(1)(x - (-1)) + (1)(y - 1) + (-1)(z - 1) &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (x + 1) + (y - 1) - (z - 1) &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x + y - z + 1 - 1 + 1 &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x + y - z + 1 &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (x + y - z) + 1 &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nComparing this equation to our desired form, we have:\n\n$$\\boxed{1x + 1y - 1z + 1 = 0}$$"
