    "To find the period of the given function $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, let's recall the general formula for the period of the cosine function:\n\nThe period of $y = \\cos (bx)$ is $\\frac{2\\pi}{|b|}$.\n\nIn this case, the function can be rewritten as $y = \\cos \\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)$, where $b = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting $b = \\frac{1}{2}$ into the formula for the period, we get:\n\nPeriod = $\\frac{2\\pi}{\\left|\\frac{1}{2}\\right|} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\\pi\\cdot\\frac{2}{1} = 4\\pi$\n\nSo, the period of $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$ is $\\boxed{4\\pi}$.",
    "To find the period of the function $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, we need to recall the general form of the cosine function, which is $y = \\cos (bx + c)$, where $b$ is the frequency and $c$ is the phase shift. The period of the cosine function is given by $\\frac{2\\pi}{|b|}$.\n\nIn our given function, we have $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$. Here, the frequency $b$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTo find the period, we can plug the value of $b$ into the formula for the period, which is $\\frac{2\\pi}{|b|}$. In this case, the absolute value of $b$ is $\\left|\\frac{1}{2}\\right| = \\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nSo, the period of the function $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$ is equal to $\\frac{2\\pi}{\\frac{1}{2}}$. \n\nTo simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $2$:\n\n$\\frac{2\\pi}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 2}{\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2} = \\frac{4\\pi}{1} = 4\\pi.$\n\nTherefore, the period of the function $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$ is $\\boxed{4\\pi}$.\n\n However, an alternative approach could have been used to solve this problem.\n \nThink of the general cosine function's period, $2\\pi$. To find the period of the input $\\frac{x}{2}$  we multiply $2\\pi$ by $2$, yielding $4\\pi$.\n \nThus, the period of $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$ is indeed $\\boxed{4\\pi}$.",
    "To find the period of the function $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, we need to recall the general formula for the period of a cosine function, which is given by $\\frac{2\\pi}{b}$, where $b$ is the coefficient in front of the $x$ term in the argument of the cosine function.\n\nIn the given function $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, the coefficient $b = \\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, we can substitute this value into the formula for the period:\n\nPeriod $= \\frac{2\\pi}{\\frac{1}{2}}$\n\nTo simplify, we can multiply the numerator by 2:\n\nPeriod $= 2\\pi \\times 2$\n\nPeriod $= 4\\pi$\n\nSo, the period of the function $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$ is $\\boxed{4\\pi}$."
