    "To solve this problem, we will use the fact that for any triangle, the sum of the squares of the distances from the vertices to the centroid is one-third the sum of the squares of the side lengths.\n\nStep 1: Recall the formula\nWe know that $GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = \\frac{1}{3}(AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2).$\n\nStep 2: Apply the formula\nGiven that $GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = 58,$ we substitute this value into the formula from step 1 and solve for $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2.$\n\n$58 = \\frac{1}{3}(AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2)$\n\n Multiply both sides by 3:\n\n$174 = AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the squares of the side lengths is 174.\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{174}$",

    "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of the centroid and the relationship between the centroid and the lengths of the medians. \n\nLet $G$ be the centroid of triangle $ABC.$ We know that the relationship between the lengths of a median and the lengths of the sides of a triangle is given by the following equation:\n\n$GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = \\frac{1}{3}(AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2) + \\frac{1}{3}(2GM^2)$ \n\nwhere $M$ is the midpoint of $BC.$ However, we still need to calculate $GM^2.$ We can find this by locating point $D$ such that $D$ is the midpoint of $AC,$ and noticing that because $GM$ is a median, the $GD$ line segment also serves as a median for $BGD.$ Let us utilize medians $GN$ and $GO$ on $BD$ and $BC$ respectively. Since median $GO$ is also the median for $\\triangle BGD$, we can apply a formula with centroidal mean (midline) for triangles. This shows us the median formula:\n\n$GO^2=GD^2 = GM^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(AB^2 + AC^2) - \\frac{1}{12}(3BD^2) +\\frac{1}{4}BC^2.$ Since point N is also the midpoint of line BD, we can see that:\n\n$GO^2 = GM^2= GN^2= \\frac{1}{12}(BC^2+ 2BD^2).$\n\nThe distance formula can be used for B to D on B D segment, hence:\n\n$BD = \\sqrt{BC^2 - BD^2}.$ This will let us apply substitution. We can calculate $GM^2$ now by finding the relation between $BD$ and $BC: $\n\n$GM^2 = GN^2= \\frac{1}{12}(BC^2+ 2BD^2) =  \\frac{1}{12}(BC^2 + 2(BC^2 - BD^2)) = \\frac{1}{3} BC^2 - \\frac{1}{3} BD^2.$\n\nBecause the lengths of GN and GM can be used, by plugging in median lengths into the centroidal mean equation we can determine what relationship is required to answer the question: \n\n$GA^ 2+ GB^2 + GC^2 = \\frac{1}{3}(AB^2 + BC^2 + AC^2) + \\frac{1}{3}(2CM^2)$\n\n$= \\frac{1}{3}(AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2) + \\frac{1}{3}(2 * \\frac{BC^2 + (\\frac{AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2}{3})^2}{2})$"
