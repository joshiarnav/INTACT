    "To solve this equation, we can start by factoring out $\\sin x$ from each term:\n\n\\[2\\sin^3 x - 5 \\sin^2 x + 2 \\sin x = \\sin x(2\\sin^2 x - 5 \\sin x + 2) = 0.\\]\n\nNow, we have two possible cases: $\\sin x = 0$ or $(2\\sin^2 x - 5 \\sin x + 2) = 0$.\n\nCase 1: $\\sin x = 0$\nSince $\\sin x = 0$ at $x = 0$, $\\pi$, and $2 \\pi$, these are the solutions for this case.\n\nCase 2: $(2\\sin^2 x - 5 \\sin x + 2) = 0$\nTo find the solutions, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\\sin x = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 16}}{4}.\\]\n\nThis simplifies to: $\\sin x = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{9}}{4} = \\frac{5 \\pm 3}{4}$.\n\nThere are two possible values for $\\sin x$: $\\frac{5 + 3}{4} = 2$ and $\\frac{5 - 3}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nHowever, since the sine function is bounded between -1 and 1, we disregard $\\sin x = 2$. Therefore, the solutions for this case are where $\\sin x = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFrom the unit circle, we know that $\\sin x = \\frac{1}{2}$ when $x = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ and $x = \\frac{5 \\pi}{6}$.\n\nCombining the solutions from both cases, we find that the number of solutions to the original equation is: $3 + 2 = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "To find the solutions to the given equation, we need to factor it first.\n\nThe equation is given by: \n\\[2\\sin^3 x - 5 \\sin^2 x + 2 \\sin x = 0.\\]\n\nFirst, let's factor out a $\\sin x$: \n\n\\[ \\sin x (2\\sin^2 x - 5 \\sin x + 2) = 0. \\]\n\nNext, we can factor the quadratic equation inside the parenthesis by finding the factors of 2 that add up to -5. \n\nThe factors of 2 that add up to -5 are -2 and -1. \n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ \\sin x (2\\sin x -1)(\\sin x -2) = 0. \\]\n\nTo find the solutions, we can set each factor equal to 0.\n\n1. $\\sin x = 0$: \n   We can solve for $x$ in the given range by finding the values at which $\\sin x$ is equal to 0:\n   \\[ \\sin 0 = 0, \\sin \\pi = 0, \\sin 2\\pi = 0. \\]\n\n   So, we have 3 solutions from this equation.\n\n2. $2\\sin x - 1 = 0$: \n   We can solve for $x$ in the given range by finding the values at which $2\\sin x - 1$ is equal to 0:\n   \\[ 2\\sin x - 1 = 0 \\]\n   \\[ 2\\sin x = 1 \\]\n   \\[ \\sin x = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\n   We can find the values of $x$ that satisfy this equation:\n   \\[ \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}, \\sin \\frac{5\\pi}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}. \\]\n\n   So, we have 2 solutions from this equation.\n\n3. $\\sin x - 2 = 0$: \n   Since $\\sin x$ can't be greater than or equal to 2, there are no solutions to this equation.\n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions is 3 (from $\\sin x = 0$) + 2 (from $2\\sin x - 1 = 0$) = 5.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",
