    "To find $\\|-3 \\mathbf{v}\\|$, we'll use the property of vector addition and scalar multiplication. \n\nWhen a vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is multiplied by a scalar $k$, its magnitude is scaled by the absolute value of the scalar: $\\|k\\mathbf{v}\\| = |k| \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|.$\n\nGiven $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\| = 4,$ we have $\\|-3 \\mathbf{v}\\| = |-3| \\cdot \\|\\mathbf{v}\\| = 3 \\cdot 4.$\n\nSo,\n$\\|-3 \\mathbf{v}\\| = 12.$",
    "To find $\\|-3 \\mathbf{v}\\|$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Understand that $\\mathbf{v}$ is a vector with a length of 4 units.\n\n2. Note that the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is multiplied by a scalar, $-3$. This means that the length of $\\mathbf{v}$ will be scaled by a factor of $|-3| = 3$, since the absolute value of the scalar is used to determine the scaling factor.\n\n3. Now, to find the length of $-3 \\mathbf{v}$, we multiply the original length of $\\mathbf{v}$ (which is 4) by the scaling factor (which is 3).\n\n4. Multiplying 4 and 3 gives us a length of 12.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "To find $\\|-3 \\mathbf{v}\\|$, we'll need to use the properties of the vector magnitude and scalar multiplication.\n\nStep 1: Recall that the magnitude of a vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is denoted as $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|$ and is a scalar value.\n\nStep 2: Recall that multiplying a vector $\\mathbf{v}$ by a scalar $-3$ results in a new vector with the same direction as $\\mathbf{v}$ but with its magnitude scaled by the absolute value of $-3$. This is expressed as $\\|-3 \\mathbf{v}\\|$.\n\nStep 3: Because the scalar is $-3$, it will change the direction of the vector. But for the magnitude, we only need to consider the absolute value of the scalar, which is $|-3| = 3$.\n\nStep 4: Now, we can find the magnitude of $\\|-3 \\mathbf{v}\\|$ using the property of scalar multiplication. If we multiply $\\mathbf{v}$ by 3, the magnitude of $\\mathbf{v}$ would be scaled by 3. If we multiply $\\mathbf{v}$ by -3, the magnitude of $\\mathbf{v}$ would be scaled by $\\|-3|$, which is also 3.\n\nTherefore, $\\|-3 \\mathbf{v}\\| = |-3| \\cdot \\|\\mathbf{v}\\| = 3  \\cdot 4 = 12.$\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{12}$."
