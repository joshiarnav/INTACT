    "To find $|z|$, we can use the fact that $|wz| = |w| \\cdot |z|$.\n\nGiven $wz = 12-8i$ and $|w| = \\sqrt{13}$, we can first find the magnitude of $wz$, denoted $|wz|$.\n\nThe magnitude of a complex number $a+bi$ is given by $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$. For $12-8i$, we have:\n\n$|wz| = \\sqrt{12^2 + (-8)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 64} = \\sqrt{208} = 4\\sqrt{13}$.\n\nNow that we have $|wz| = 4\\sqrt{13}$ and $|w| = \\sqrt{13}$, we can use the formula $|wz| = |w| \\cdot |z|$ to solve for $|z|$:\n\n$|z| = \\frac{|wz|}{|w|} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{13}}{\\sqrt{13}} = 4$\n\nTherefore, $|z| = \\boxed{4}$.",

    "We are given that $wz = 12-8i$ and $|w| = \\sqrt{13}$.
