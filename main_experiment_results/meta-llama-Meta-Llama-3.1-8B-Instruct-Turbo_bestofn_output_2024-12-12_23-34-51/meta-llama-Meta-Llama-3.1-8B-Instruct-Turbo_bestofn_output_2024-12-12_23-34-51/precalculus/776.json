    "To find the equation of the plane, we need a normal vector to the plane. The foot of the perpendicular from the origin to the plane is given as (12, -4, 3), which lies on the plane. Since the normal vector is perpendicular to this point, it can be taken as the normal vector of the plane itself.\n\nThe normal vector can be represented as:\n\\[\\vec{n} = (A, B, C) = (12, -4, 3).\\]\n\nNow, we can use the point-normal form of a plane to find the equation of the plane. The point-normal form is given by:\n\\[A(x - x_1) + B(y - y_1) + C(z - z_1) = 0.\\]\n\nWe have the point (x1, y1, z1) = (12, -4, 3) and the normal vector (A, B, C) = (12, -4, 3). We can put these values in the point-normal form of the equation of a plane.\n\nSubstituting the values in the point-normal form:\n\\[12(x - 12) - 4(y - (-4)) + 3(z - 3) = 0.\\]\n\nExpanding the above equation:\n\\[12x - 144 - 4y - 16 + 3z - 9 = 0.\\]\n\nCombine the constant terms:\n\\[12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0.\\]\n\nSo, the equation of the plane is:\n\\[\\boxed{12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0.}\\]",

    "To find the equation of a plane, we first need a normal vector to the plane.  The normal vector can be obtained from the foot of the perpendicular from the origin to the plane. The foot of the perpendicular is given as $(12,-4,3)$ and it is also the point where the normal vector intersects the plane. Since it's the point where the normal vector intersects the plane it must be parallel to the plane hence it must be perpendicular to any vector lying in the plane.  \n\nHowever, since we already have that point, we can take the vector from the origin to that point which is also the normal vector as its direction to that point is along the normal of the plane. This is equivalent to $\\vec{n} = (12,-4,3)$.\n\nNow that we have our normal vector, $\\vec{n}$, one vector in the plane can be found by choosing a point on the plane and subtracting the foot of the perpendicular from the origin. If we let $P$ be some point on the plane, then the vector from the origin to $P$ must be parallel to the plane (and therefore perpendicular to the normal vector of the plane).\n\nSince the normal vector $\\vec{n} = (12,-4,3)$ is perpendicular to the plane, their dot product must be zero at the point of contact.\n\nNow let's think about how we can create an equation for the plane in terms of the point $(12,-4,3)$. The formula for the equation of the plane $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0$ can be obtained by plugging in the point it contains and the normal to the plane. This allows us to form a linear system where all but one variable in the system are defined by the input data. \n\nWe can set $(x,y,z)$ to be some point $(x,y,z)$ on the plane, then we can write $A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) = 0$ and plug in $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ as $(12, -4, 3)$ which in turn gives\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{A}(x - 12) + \\mathrm{B}(y + 4) + \\mathrm{C}(z - 3)&=0\\\\\n\\mathrm{A}x - 12\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B}y + 4\\mathrm{B} + \\mathrm{C}z - 3\\mathrm{C} &=0\\\\\n\\mathrm{A}x+\\mathrm{B}y+\\mathrm{C}z - (12\\mathrm{A} - 4\\mathrm{B} - 3\\mathrm{C}) &= 0\n\\end{align}\n\nOur normal vector is $\\mathrm{A} = 12$, $\\mathrm{B} = -4$ and $\\mathrm{C} = 3$ which leads us to the following\n\n$12x - 4y + 3z + L = 0$\n\nNow we can let $(x, y, z)$ be the point $P$ in the plane, to obtain the following relation:\n\n\\begin{align}\n12x - 4y + 3z + L &= 0.\n\\end{align}\n\nThe $x$, $y$ and $z$ are not defined by the input data which in our case are $(12, -4, 3)$. We need the constants that are defined by the input data, so let's try setting $(x, y, z)$ to be $(12, -4, 3)$ and the equation turns into:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n12(12) - 4(-4) + 3(3) + L &= 0\\\\\n(144+16+9)+L&=0\\\\\n169+L&=0\\\\\nL&= -169\n\\end{align*}\n\nand it follows that $12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0.$"
