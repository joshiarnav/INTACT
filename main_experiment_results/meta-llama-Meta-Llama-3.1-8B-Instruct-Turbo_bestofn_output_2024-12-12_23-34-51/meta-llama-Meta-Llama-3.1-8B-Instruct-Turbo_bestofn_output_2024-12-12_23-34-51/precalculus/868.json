    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Define the function $f(x) = \\tan x - x$.

We also note that $\\tan 0 = 0$, which means that $f(0) = 0$.\n\n3. Now consider $f(x) = \\tan x - x$. We want to find the number of solutions of $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$. This is true if and only if $x = -f(x) + \\tan x$ for $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$.\n\n4. As we have $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function, we can observe that for sufficiently large x in the given interval, $f(x) > x - \\tan^{-1} 942 > 0$. We can also specify the bounds for $f(x)$.\n\n5. Now we also note that for $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$ we have $\\tan x \\in [0, 942]$, from this information we can determine the boundaries of our function $f(x)$.\n\n6. We can analyze the intersection points of our function $f(x)$ and line $y = -x + \\tan x$ for each interval $[2k \\pi, (2k+1) \\pi]$.\n\n7. We also note that for each period of $\\tan x$, we have $2\\pi$, which within the given interval gives us $\\frac{942}{2\\pi}$ periods of the $\\tan x$ function.\n\n8. Given these boundaries, we can conclude the number of intersection points between the strictly increasing function $f(x)$ and $y=-x + \\tan x$ within the interval for $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions for the equation is given by $\\boxed{\\lfloor \\frac{942}{\\pi} \\rfloor}$.",
