    "To find the range of the function $y=\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ for $-90^\\circ< x < 90^\\circ$, we need to analyze the behavior of each component.\n\n1. **Range of $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$**:\nSince $-90^\\circ< x < 90^\\circ$, we have $0 < \\cos x \\le 1$. Taking the square root, we get $0 < \\sqrt{\\cos x} \\le 1$.\n\n2. **Range of $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$**:\nThe logarithm function $\\log_2(x)$ is defined only for non-negative numbers. Since $\\sqrt{\\cos x} \\le 1$, we are within the domain of the logarithm.\n\nNow, since $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$ can take any value between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive), the possible values of $\\log_2(\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ will range from -\u221e to 0.\n\nTherefore, the range of the function $y=\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ for $-90^\\circ< x < 90^\\circ$ is $\\boxed{(-\\infty, 0]}$.",
    "To find the range of the function $y = \\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$, we need to analyze the given function and any constraints on its domain.\n\n1. **Given function:** $y = \\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$\n\n2. **Domain constraint:** $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$\n\n   This constraint tells us that the input $x$ is restricted to being within the second and fourth quadrants, where cosine is positive.\n\n3. **Square root constraint:** The argument of a square root function must be non-negative. This means that we require $\\cos x \\geq 0$, which is true for all the values of $x$ in the domain specified.\n\n4. **Logarithm constraint:** The argument of a logarithm function must be strictly positive (i.e., greater than zero). This means that $\\sqrt{\\cos x} > 0$, which implies $\\cos x > 0$. Since this is true for all values of $x$ in the given domain, the logarithm function will be defined for all $x$ in the given range.\n\n5. **Minimum value of cosine:** In the given domain, the value of $\\cos x$ varies from 0 to 1. Since $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$ takes values in the interval [0, 1], and the minimum value in this interval is 0 (exclusive), we can conclude that $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$ will take on all values greater than 0.\n\n6. **Range of the logarithm function:** Since the range of $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$ is all positive real numbers, the range of $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ is the set of real numbers. However, because the argument of the logarithm must be strictly greater than 0, we can conclude that $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ will have a minimum value.\n\n7. **Minimum value of the logarithm:** As $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$ approaches 0 from the right, $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ will approach negative infinity. The maximum value of the logarithm will be determined by the value of $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos 0}) = \\log_2 (\\sqrt{1}) = \\log_2 (1) = 0$.\n\nHowever, taking into account the domain defined we conclude  $y \\in (-\\infty ,0]$",
    "To find the range of the function $y=\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$, we need to break it down into steps.\n\n1. The function $y = \\cos x$ is a periodic function that oscillates between 1 and -1. However, in the given interval $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$, $\\cos x$ will only take values between 0 and 1, because cosine is positive in the first quadrant and the value of cosine decreases as we move from $90^\\circ$ to $0^\\circ$.\n\n2. The $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$ function will have values between 0 and 1, since the square root of a positive value is also positive.\n\n3. The inverse of the logarithmic function, i.e., the exponential function, will take the output of the square root function ($\\sqrt{\\cos x}$) and give us $2^{\\sqrt{\\cos x}}$. \n\n4. Since the input for logarithmic functions (in this case, $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$) is always positive, the output will be non-negative.\n\n5. The maximum value of $\\cos x$ in the interval $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$ is 1. \n\n6. When we take the $\\log_2$ of 1, we get $\\log_2 (1) = 0$ (since any number to the power of 0 is 1). This gives us the lower bound of the range.\n\n7. The minimum value of $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$ will approach 0 as $\\cos x$ approaches 0, but will never actually be 0.\n\n8. When we take the $\\log_2$ of a number approaching 0 from the right (from positive numbers), the function approaches $-\\infty$. \n\nHowever, since $-\\infty$ is not included in the range of a logarithmic function, we conclude that the actual range is the interval $(0, \\infty)$.\n\nBut the task asks for the actual range as an answer.\n \nTherefore, the answer is: $\\boxed{(0,\\infty)}$."
