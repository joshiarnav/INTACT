    "To find the point where the line intersects the xy-plane, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the direction vector of the line**: The direction vector is found by subtracting the coordinates of the two given points. \n\n   For points (x1, y1, z1) = (3, 4, 1) and (x2, y2, z2) = (5, 1, 6), the direction vector d = (x2 - x1, y2 - y1, z2 - z1) = (5 - 3, 1 - 4, 6 - 1) = (2, -3, 5).\n\n   The direction vector is d = (2, -3, 5).\n\n2. **Write the parametric equations of the line**: Using the point (3, 4, 1) and the direction vector d = (2, -3, 5), we can write the parametric equations:\n\n   x = 3 + 2t\n   y = 4 - 3t\n   z = 1 + 5t\n\n3. **Find the point where the line intersects the xy-plane**: The xy-plane is defined by z = 0. To find the point of intersection, we set z = 0 in the parametric equation of the line.\n\n   From the equation z = 1 + 5t, we have:\n   0 = 1 + 5t\n   -1 = 5t\n   -1/5 = t\n\n4. **Find the coordinates of the point of intersection**: Now that we have the value of t, we can substitute it back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates of the point.\n\n   x = 3 + 2t = 3 + 2(-1/5) = 3 - 2/5 = 13/5\n   y = 4 - 3t = 4 - 3(-1/5) = 4 + 3/5 = 23/5\n   z = 1 + 5t = 1 + 5(-1/5) = 1 - 1 = 0\n\n   So the point of intersection is (13/5, 23/5, 0).",

The line can be parameterized by a point on the line and the direction vector.
