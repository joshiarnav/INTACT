    "To find $\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right),$ we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the given angle from radians to degrees, since it might be more intuitive. We know that $\\pi$ radians is equal to 180 degrees. \n\n   To convert $-\\frac{3\\pi}{4}$ to degrees, we use the conversion factor:\n\n   \\[-\\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\times \\frac{180^{\\circ}}{\\pi} = -135^{\\circ}.\\]\n\n2. Since tangent has the same value at coterminal angles (angles that differ by a full rotation of $360^{\\circ}$), we can add or subtract multiples of full rotations (360 degrees) without changing the value of the tangent. \n\n   Here, $-135^{\\circ}$ and $-135^{\\circ} + 360^{\\circ} = 225^{\\circ}$ are coterminal angles. We know the tangent of $225^{\\circ}$, which is in the third quadrant. \n\n3. The reference angle for $225^{\\circ}$ is $45^{\\circ},$ as it is the acute angle formed by the terminal side of $225^{\\circ}$ and the x-axis. \n\n4. We know that the tangent of $45^{\\circ}$ is 1. However, the tangent function changes sign based on the quadrant. Since $225^{\\circ}$ is in the third quadrant, the tangent is negative.\n\n   Hence, $\\tan(225^{\\circ}) = \\tan(225^{\\circ} - 180^{\\circ})$ = $\\tan(45^{\\circ})$ = -1.\n\n5. Now we can use the fact that tangent has the same value at coterminal angles. As $-135^{\\circ}$ and $225^{\\circ}$ are coterminal angles, we have:\n\n   $$\\tan(-135^{\\circ}) = \\tan(-135^{\\circ} + 360^{\\circ}) = \\tan(225^{\\circ}) = -1.$$\n   \nTherefore, $\\boxed{-1}.$",

    "To find $\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right),$ we can use the properties of the tangent function, particularly the periodicity and the properties of negative angles.\n\n1. First, let's evaluate the angle $-\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$ in the unit circle. We know that $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ is in the second quadrant, where the sine is positive and the cosine is positive. Since we have a negative sign in front, we will be in the fourth quadrant, where the sine becomes negative and the cosine remains positive.\n\n2. The reference angle for $-\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$ will be $\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$ (the positive angle that we evaluate in the unit circle). \n\n3.
