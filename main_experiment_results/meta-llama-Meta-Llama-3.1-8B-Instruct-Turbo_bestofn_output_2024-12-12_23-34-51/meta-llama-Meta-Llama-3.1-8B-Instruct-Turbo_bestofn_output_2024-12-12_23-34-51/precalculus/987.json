    "To find the number of real solutions of the equation \\(\\frac{x}{100} = \\sin x\\), let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Graphical Representation**: \n\nThe equation can be graphed as a line \\(y = \\frac{x}{100}\\) and the sine function \\(\\sin x\\). The intersection points of these two graphs are the real solutions of the equation.\n\n2. **Identifying Intersection Points**:\n\n- For small values of x close to 0, the line \\(y = \\frac{x}{100}\\) is very close to the x-axis. This means, at first, the line and the sine function won't intersect close to 0.\n\n- As x approaches the value 63.441 (the first positive solution in the given equation), the line starts intersecting the sine function. After that point (up to the first negative solution, approximately -62.440), the line and the sine function will intersect multiple times.\n\n- After the first positive solution, both the sine function and the line will intersect for about 32 positive solutions.",

The sine function goes above and below the line for positive x, and crosses the line in 32 different points in each period of the sine function.

This gives 64 periods, resulting in a range of 32*64 = 2048 intersections.\n\n6. **Negative interval**: Just like the interval above the line in each period of the sine function, there are 2048 intersections for the interval below the line, giving 2048 intersections in the negative domain.\n\nHowever, we are asked for the total intersections that also satisfy defined equation conditions\n\nThis results in:\n\\(\\begin{aligned}\n2048 + 2048 &= 4096.\n\\end{aligned}\\)\n\nSo, the total number of real solutions of the equation \\(\\frac{x}{100} = \\sin x\\) is \\boxed{4096}.",
    "To find the number of real solutions of the equation, we can use the concept of the intersection points of two curves. The given equation is:\n\\[\\frac{x}{100} = \\sin x.\\]\n\nNow, let's analyze the two curves involved:\n\n- The curve of $y = \\frac{x}{100}$ is a straight line with a slope of $\\frac{1}{100}$ and a $y$-intercept of 0. It can be approximated by a line with a $y$-intercept of 0 and a positive slope for $x\\geq0$.\n\n- The curve of $y = \\sin x$ is a periodic wave with a period of $2\\pi$. It oscillates between -1 and 1.\n\nAt $x = 0,$ we have $x/100=0$, and sin(0) = 0, so one real solution exists.  \nNow for small $x > 0,$ $y = \\frac{x}{100} < 0.0005$ while sin(x) > 0,  and since x/100 is monotonically increasing while sin(x) are not sin(x) does intersect with x/100 at this point because they have shared y coordinates.\nAt $x = \\pi,$ $\\frac{x}{100} = \\frac{\\pi}{100}$ while $\\sin(\\pi) = 0,$ so the line and the sine curve intersect at this point because the sine curve value at $ \\pi$ is  0. This is two real solutions. Then a little before that point where the sine wave has its highest peak for the negative section the line barely breaks above the sine curve in that area of x interval 0 <=x<=\u03c0,.\nAt $x = 3\\pi,$ the value of $\\frac{x}{100}$ is $\\frac{3\\pi}{100},$ while $\\sin(3\\pi) = 0.$\nThis implies that there are at least eight real solutions as seen for this part of the interval space. However, for a more detailed analysis, we may need to get the sine values of other points.\n\nHowever the closer the x values to multiples of \u03c0 they have the higher the chance of the sine wave and the line cutting, and intersecting. There will be interactions between intervals around x= 100\u03c0 in the interactions between $sin(x)$ and $x/100$.  The number of times the curves intersect will be finite and can be determined by looking at the behavior of the interactions above this interval of $x$.\n\nNow the x/100 $y$-values in this area, tend to 0 for any x as it goes farther in the space. However $\\sin(x)$ a periodic function between the values of -1 & 1 tends to oscillate at the top & bottom when $x$ in the specific area space far away. Other thing to note is:\n$\\sin(x)$ is a periodic function, $\\sin(\\pi+x)$= $ - \\sin(x).$ $\\sin(2\\pi+x)$ = $ \\sin(x) $, $\\sin(3\\pi+x) = -sin(x) $; and periodically so on. \n\nSince $sin$ must be < 1; x $y$ intercept is specific because there is not value of x $y$ intercept here for some $y$ value on the $ \\sin (x).$"
