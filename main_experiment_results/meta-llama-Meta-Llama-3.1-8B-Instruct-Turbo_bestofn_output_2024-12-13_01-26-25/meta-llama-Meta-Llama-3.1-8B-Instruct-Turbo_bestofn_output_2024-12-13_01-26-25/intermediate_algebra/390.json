    "To find the slant asymptote, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator. This can be done using polynomial long division or synthetic division. \n\nFirst, let's set up the polynomial long division:\n\n- The numerator is $2x^2 + 3x - 7$.\n- The denominator is $x-3$.\n\nSince we are looking for the slant asymptote as $x$ approaches $\\infty$ or $-\\infty$, we want to divide the numerator by the denominator to get the equation of the slant asymptote.\n\nPerforming the polynomial long division:\n\n- Divide the leading term of the numerator by the denominator: $\\frac{2x^2}{x-3} = 2x + 6$\n- Multiply the denominator by the result and subtract it from the numerator: $(x-3)(2x+6) = 2x^2 + 12x - 18$\n- Subtract the result from the numerator: $(2x^2 + 3x - 7) - (2x^2 + 12x - 18) = -9x + 11$\n\nNow we have the result: \n- The quotient is $2x + 6$.\n- The remainder is $-9x + 11$.\n\nThe slant asymptote is the quotient, which is $y = 2x + 6$. \n\nTo find $m+b$, we need to find the values of $m$ and $b$ in the equation $y = mx + b$.\n\nBy comparing $y = 2x + 6$ with $y = mx + b$, we get:\n- $m = 2$\n- $b = 6$\n\nSo $m + b = 2 + 6 = 8$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n\n$\\boxed{8}$",

  "critique": "The correct answer is 2 because solution 2 is more accurate in finding the slant asymptote. Solution 2 correctly identifies the slant asymptote as $y = 2x + 9$, whereas solution 1 incorrectly identifies it as $y = 2x + 6$. \n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2.",
  "solution": "To approach this problem, we can either use long division or synthetic division to evaluate the quotient of the given rational expression. Alternatively, we can rewrite the numerator as $2x^2 + 3x - 7$ $ = 2x^2 + 3x - 7 - 9x + 9x$ $ = 2x(x-3) + 9x - 7 - 20 + 20$ $ = 2x(x-3) + 9(x-3) + 20$. Hence, $$y = \\frac{2x^2 + 3x - 7}{x-3} = \\frac{(2x+9)(x-3) + 20}{x-3} = 2x+9 +\\frac{20}{x-3}.$$As $x$ approaches infinity or negative infinity, then the fraction approaches $0$, and $y$ approaches $2x + 9$.Thus, $m+b = \\boxed{11}.$ [asy]\nimport graph; size(7cm); real lsf=0.5; pen dps=linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10); defaultpen(dps); pen ds=black; real xmin=-27.84,xmax=46.9,ymin=-33.28,ymax=45.43;\n\nLabel laxis; laxis.p=fontsize(10);\n\nxaxis(xmin,xmax,Ticks(laxis,Step=20.0,Size=2,NoZero),Arrows(6),above=true); yaxis(ymin,ymax,Ticks(laxis,Step=20.0,Size=2,NoZero),Arrows(6),above=true); real f1(real x){return (2*x^2+3*x-7)/(x-3);} draw(graph(f1,-27.83,2.99),linewidth(1)); draw(graph(f1,3.01,46.89),linewidth(1)); draw((xmin,2*xmin+9)--(xmax,2*xmax+9), linetype(\"2 2\"));\n\nlabel(\"$y = \\frac{2x^2 + 3x - 7}{x - 3}$\",(5.67,-27.99),NE*lsf); label(\"$y = 2x + 9$\",(18.43,35.5),NE*lsf);\n\nclip((xmin,ymin)--(xmin,ymax)--(xmax,ymax)--(xmax,ymin)--cycle);\n\n[/asy]",
