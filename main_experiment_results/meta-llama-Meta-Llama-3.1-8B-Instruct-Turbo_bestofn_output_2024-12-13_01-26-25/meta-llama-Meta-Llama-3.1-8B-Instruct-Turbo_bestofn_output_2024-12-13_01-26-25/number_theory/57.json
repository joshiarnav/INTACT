    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. We are given three positive integers. Let's denote them as $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n2. When $a$ is divided by $24$, the remainder is $10$. This can be written as $a \\equiv 10 \\mod 24$.\n3. Similarly, when $b$ is divided by $24$, the remainder is $4$, which can be written as $b \\equiv 4 \\mod 24$.\n4. When $c$ is divided by $24$, the remainder is $12$, which can be written as $c \\equiv 12 \\mod 24$.\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when the sum of these three integers is divided by $24$.\n\n5. The sum of the three integers can be written as $a + b + c$.\n6. Using the congruence relations from steps 2, 3, and 4, we can rewrite the sum as:\n$a + b + c \\equiv 10 + 4 + 12 \\mod 24$\n\n7. Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:\n$a + b + c \\equiv 26 \\mod 24$\n8. Now, we want to find the remainder when $26$ is divided by $24$.\n9. Dividing $26$ by $24$ leaves a remainder of $2$ (since $24 \\cdot 1 = 24$ and $24 + 2 = 26$).\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$ is $2$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "Given the three positive integers, let's denote them as a, b, and c. \n\nWe know that when a is divided by 24, the remainder is 10, so a can be written as:\na = 24p + 10\n\nSimilarly, when b is divided by 24, the remainder is 4, so b can be written as:\nb = 24q + 4\n\nWhen c is divided by 24, the remainder is 12, so c can be written as:\nc = 24r + 12\n\nNow, let's find the sum of a, b, and c:\nS = a + b + c\n= (24p + 10) + (24q + 4) + (24r + 12)\n= 24p + 24q + 24r + 10 + 4 + 12\n= 24p + 24q + 24r + 26\n\nNow, we can factor out 24:\nS = 24(p + q + r) + 26\n\nNow, when 26 is divided by 24, the remainder is 2.\n\nSo, the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24 is 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n$\\boxed{2}$",
    "Let the three integers be $a$, $b$, and $c$. \n\nSince the remainders of $a$, $b$, and $c$ when divided by $24$ are $10$, $4$, and $12$ respectively, we can express them as:\n\n$a = 24k + 10$\n$b = 24m + 4$\n$c = 24n + 12$\n\nwhere $k$, $m$, and $n$ are non-negative integers.\n\nThe sum of the three integers is given by:\n$a + b + c = (24k + 10) + (24m + 4) + (24n + 12)$\n\nCombine like terms:\n$a + b + c = 24k + 24m + 24n + 10 + 4 + 12$\n$a + b + c = 24(k + m + n) + 26$\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when the sum $a + b + c$ is divided by $24$. Since $24(k + m + n)$ is a multiple of $24$ (every term inside the parentheses is an integer, thus it is a multiple of $24$), the remainder will be determined by the constant term $26$.\n\nDividing $26$ by $24$ gives a remainder of $2$. Therefore, the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$ is $\\boxed{2}$."

  "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 10\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 12\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 10+4+12 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $24$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
