    "To simplify the expression $(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5$, let's follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: \n   - First, add 6 and 1: 6 + 1 = 7\n   - Then, subtract 4 from the result: 7 - 4 = 3\n   So, the expression becomes $(21 \\div 3) \\cdot 5$.\n\n2. Now, evaluate the division:\n   - Divide 21 by 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7\n   So, the expression becomes $7 \\cdot 5$.\n\n3. Finally, evaluate the multiplication:\n   - Multiply 7 by 5: 7 \u00d7 5 = 35\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{35}$.",

  "solution": "Recall that expressions within parentheses should be done first. In the inner set of parentheses, we have $6+1-4=3.$ So, the outer set of parentheses can be rewritten as $21\\div3=7.$ Finally, \\[(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5=7\\cdot5=\\boxed{35}.\\]",
