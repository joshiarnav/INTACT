    "To round to the nearest hundredth, we need to look at the digit in the thousandth place, which is 8 in this case. \n\nSince 8 is less than 5, we round down. \n\nSo, 0 will remain the same, and we change 8 to 4 but the 5 stays as is. \n\nThe number rounded to the nearest hundredth is 18.49.\n\nTherefore, our answer in the required format is $\\boxed{18.49}$.",
    "To round 18.4851 to the nearest hundredth, we need to look at the digit in the thousandth place, which is 5.\n\n1. If the digit is less than 5, we round down, so it becomes 00.\n2. If the digit is 5 or greater, we round up.\n\nSince 5 is equal to 5, we round up the digit in the hundredth place.\n\nSo, the number 18.4851 rounded to the nearest hundredth is: $\\boxed{18.49}$"

  "solution": "To round $18.4851$ to the nearest hundredth, we must look at the hundreds and the thousands digits of the number in question. Since the thousands digit ($5$) is greater than or equal to $5$, the hundreds digit $8$ rounds up to $9$. Therefore, $18.4851$ rounded to the nearest hundredth is equal to $\\boxed{18.49}$.",
