    "To find $(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5$, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: $6 + 1 - 4$\n- First, add 6 and 1: $6 + 1 = 7$\n- Then, subtract 4 from 7: $7 - 4 = 3$\n\nSo, the expression inside the parentheses is $3$.\n\n2. Now, divide 21 by 3: $21 \\div 3 = 7$\n\n3. Finally, multiply the result by 5: $7 \\cdot 5 = 35$\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{35}$.",
