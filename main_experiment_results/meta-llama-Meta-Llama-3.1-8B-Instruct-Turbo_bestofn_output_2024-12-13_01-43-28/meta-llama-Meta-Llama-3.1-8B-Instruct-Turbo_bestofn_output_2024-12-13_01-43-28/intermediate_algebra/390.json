    "To find the slant asymptote of the rational expression, we can perform long division or synthetic division. \n\nGiven the expression $y = \\frac{2x^2 + 3x - 7}{x - 3}$, let's divide the numerator by the denominator.\n\nFirst, we can write the expression as $y = 2x + 6 + \\frac{-21x + 7}{x - 3}$.\n\nWe can see that the slant asymptote is the part without the remainder fraction, so it is $y = 2x + 6$.\n\nIn the form $y = mx + b$, we have $m = 2$ and $b = 6$. \n\nTo find the value of $m + b$, we add these values together:\n\n$m + b = 2 + 6 = 8$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{8}$.",

Divide the numerator by the denominator: \n\nTo divide $2x^2 + 3x - 7$ by $x - 3$, we can use long division or synthetic division. \n\nLet's use long division:\n\n- Divide the leading term of the numerator ($2x^2$) by the leading term of the denominator ($x$). This gives us $2x$. \n- Multiply $2x$ by the denominator ($x - 3$) to get $2x^2 - 6x$.\n- Subtract this from the original numerator: $(2x^2 + 3x - 7) - (2x^2 - 6x) = 9x - 7$.\n- Now, divide the new leading term ($9x$) by the leading term of the denominator ($x$). This gives us $9$.\n- Multiply $9$ by the denominator ($x - 3$) to get $9x - 27$.\n- Subtract this from the result we obtained in the previous step: $(9x - 7) - (9x - 27) = 20$.\n\nSince the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the denominator, we stop here.\n\n2. Write the result of the long division as a mixed expression: \n\n$2x + 9 + \\frac{20}{x - 3}$\n\nSince the original expression involves dividing by $x - 3$, as $x$ approaches $\\infty$ or $-\\infty$, the fraction $\\frac{20}{x-3}$ approaches 0.\n\nSo, the slant asymptote is given by the non-remainder part: $y = 2x + 9$.\n\nComparing this to the form $y = mx + b$, we see that $m = 2$ and $b = 9$.\n\nThus, $m + b = 2 + 9 = 11$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{11}$."

  "solution": "To approach this problem, we can either use long division or synthetic division to evaluate the quotient of the given rational expression. Alternatively, we can rewrite the numerator as $2x^2 + 3x - 7$ $ = 2x^2 + 3x - 7 - 9x + 9x$ $ = 2x(x-3) + 9x - 7 - 20 + 20$ $ = 2x(x-3) + 9(x-3) + 20$.
