    "To find the residue of the given expression $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$, let's first simplify the expression by finding the residue of each term separately.\n\n1. $182\\cdot 12\\pmod{14}$\nFirst, let's simplify $182\\pmod{14}$. We can write $182$ as $14\\cdot 13$. Therefore, $182\\equiv 0\\pmod{14}$.\n\nNow, let's calculate $12\\pmod{14}$. We can write $12$ as $14\\cdot -1 + 12$. Therefore, $12\\equiv 12\\pmod{14}$.\n\nSo, $182\\cdot 12 \\equiv 0\\cdot 12 \\equiv 0\\pmod{14}$.\n\n2. $15\\cdot 7\\pmod{14}$\nFirst, let's simplify $15\\pmod{14}$. We can write $15$ as $14\\cdot 1 + 1$. Therefore, $15\\equiv 1\\pmod{14}$.\n\nNow, let's calculate $7\\pmod{14}$. We can write $7$ as $14\\cdot 0 + 7 \\equiv 7\\pmod{14}$.\n\nSo, $15\\cdot 7 \\equiv 1\\cdot 7 \\equiv 7\\pmod{14}$.\n\n3. $3\\pmod{14}$.\nWe can write $3$ as $14\\cdot 0 + 3\\equiv 3\\pmod{14}$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the final expression $182\\cdot 12 \\equiv 0\\pmod{14}$, $-15\\cdot 7 \\equiv -7\\pmod{14}$, and $3\\pmod{14}$.\nSo, $182\\cdot 12 -15\\cdot 7 + 3\\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4\\pmod{14}$.\n\nFinally, since $-4$ is equivalent to $10\\pmod{14}$, the residue of the given expression $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$ is equivalent to $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "To find the residue of $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$, we'll simplify the expression step by step, considering the modulus operation at each step.\n\n1. $182\\cdot 12$: Since 182 is a multiple of 14, this product is also a multiple of 14. Hence, $182\\cdot 12\\equiv0\\pmod{14}$.\n\n2. $15\\cdot 7$: Now let's simplify the product. Since we want the result modulo 14, we can write:\n\n\\[15\\cdot 7 = (14+1)\\cdot 7=14\\cdot 7 + 1\\cdot 7\\]\n\nSince we're working modulo 14, the $14\\cdot 7$ term vanishes, and we're left with $1\\cdot 7$.\n\nSo, we have $15\\cdot 7 \\equiv 7\\pmod{14}$.\n\n3. Adding the terms, we have:\n\\[0\\cdot 12 - 7 + 3\\]\n\nCombining the constants, we have:\n\\[-7 + 3 = -4\\]\n\nNow, let's find its residue modulo 14.\n\nTo find the residue of -4 mod 14, we can simply add 14 to -4, which will give us a positive number. Adding 14 to -4 results in 10.\n\nTherefore, the residue is:\n\n\\boxed{10}",
    "To find the residue of $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\pmod{14}$, let's evaluate each term step by step.\n\n1. Evaluate $182 \\pmod{14}$:\n   $182 \\pmod{14} = 182 - (14 \\times 13) = 0$\n\n   Since $182 \\pmod{14} = 0$, we can replace $182$ with $0$ in the expression.\n\n2.

  "solution": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7.
