    "To solve this problem, let's first consider what the remainders tell us about the three integers. \n\nWhen the three integers are divided by 24, the remainders are 10, 4, and 12. This means that the three integers can be expressed as $24a+10$, $24b+4$, and $24c+12$ for some non-negative integers $a$, $b$, and $c$. \n\nNow, let's find the sum of the three integers:\n$(24a+10) + (24b+4) + (24c+12) = 24a + 24b + 24c + 26 = 24(a+b+c) + 26$\n\nTo find the remainder when this sum is divided by 24, we need to find the remainder of 26 divided by 24.\n\n$26 = 24 \\times 1 + 2$\n\nSo, the remainder of 26 divided by 24 is 2.\n\nTherefore, when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24, the remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "Let's denote the three integers as $a$, $b$, and $c$. When these integers are divided by $24$, the remainders are $10,$ $4,$ and $12$, respectively.\n\nWe can express $a$, $b$, and $c$ as:\n- $a = 24q_1 + 10$\n- $b = 24q_2 + 4$\n- $c = 24q_3 + 12$\n\nwhere $q_1$, $q_2$, and $q_3$ are some non-negative integers.\n\nThe sum of the three integers, $S$, can be written as:\n- $S = (24q_1 + 10) + (24q_2 + 4) + (24q_3 + 12)$\n- $S = 24(q_1 + q_2 + q_3) + 26$\n\nWe want to find the remainder when $S$ is divided by $24$. To do this, we can first factor out $24$ from the sum:\n- $S = 24(q_1 + q_2 + q_3 + 1) + 2$\n\nSince $24(q_1 + q_2 + q_3 + 1)$ is a multiple of $24$, it does not contribute any remainder when $S$ is divided by $24$. Therefore, the remainder is solely determined by the constant term $2$.\n\nHence, when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, the remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "To find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\nLet the three integers be $a$, $b$, and $c$. We know that:\n\n- $a$ divided by $24$ leaves a remainder of $10$, so $a = 24n + 10$ for some integer $n$.\n- $b$ divided by $24$ leaves a remainder of $4$, so $b = 24m + 4$ for some integer $m$.\n- $c$ divided by $24$ leaves a remainder of $12$, so $c = 24p + 12$ for some integer $p$.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the three integers:\n\n$a + b + c = (24n + 10) + (24m + 4) + (24p + 12)$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$a + b + c = 24n + 24m + 24p + 26$\n\nFactor out the common factor $24$:\n\n$a + b + c = 24(n + m + p) + 26$\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when the sum $a + b + c$ is divided by $24$. To do this, we can rewrite the sum as:\n\n$a + b + c = 24(n + m + p) + 24 + 2$\n\nWhen we divide $24(n + m + p) + 24 + 2$ by $24$, the term $24(n + m + p)$ will be perfectly divisible by $24$, leaving no remainder. The remaining terms, $24 + 2 = 26$, will leave a remainder of $2$ when divided by $24$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$ is $\\boxed{2}$."

  "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$.
