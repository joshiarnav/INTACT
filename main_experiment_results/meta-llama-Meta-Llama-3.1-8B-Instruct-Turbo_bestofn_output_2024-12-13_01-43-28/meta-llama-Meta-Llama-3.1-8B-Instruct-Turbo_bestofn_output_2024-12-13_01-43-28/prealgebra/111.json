    "To solve this expression step by step, we'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:\n    $6 + 1 - 4 = 3$\n\n2.

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe reason is that Solution 1 is the most concise and straightforward solution. It clearly follows the order of operations and breaks down the problem into simple, easy-to-follow steps. The language used is also clear and easy to understand.\n\nAll three solutions arrive at the same answer, which is $\\boxed{35}$. However, Solution 1 is the most efficient and effective solution.",
  "solution": "Recall that expressions within parentheses should be done first. In the inner set of parentheses, we have $6+1-4=3.$ So, the outer set of parentheses can be rewritten as $21\\div3=7.$ Finally, \\[(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5=7\\cdot5=\\boxed{35}.\\]",
