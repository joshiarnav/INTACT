    "To round 18.4851 to the nearest hundredth, we need to look at the thousandth place, which is the third decimal place. \n\nThe thousandth place is 5. \n\nSince the thousandth place is 5 or greater, we will round up the hundredth place. \n\nThe hundredth place is 8, so when we round up, it becomes 9. \n\nTherefore, 18.4851 rounded to the nearest hundredth is 18.49.\n\n$\\boxed{18.49}$",
    "To round to the nearest hundredth, we need to look at the thousandth place (the third decimal place).\n\nWe have: 18.4851\n\nThe thousandth place is 1. \n\nSince the digit in the thousandth place is 5 or greater, we round up the digit in the hundredth place. \n\nThe digit in the hundredth place is 8, so it rounds up to 9.\n\nTherefore, 18.4851 rounded to the nearest hundredth is: $\\boxed{18.49}$",
    "To round 18.4851 to the nearest hundredth, we need to look at the digit that is one place to the right of the hundredths place, which is the thousandths place. In this case, that digit is 5.\n\nSince 5 is greater than or equal to 5, we round the digit in the hundredths place up by 1. Therefore, the digit in the hundredths place becomes 9.\n\nThe number rounded to the nearest hundredth is 18.49. So, the answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{18.49}$"

  "solution": "To round $18.4851$ to the nearest hundredth, we must look at the hundreds and the thousands digits of the number in question. Since the thousands digit ($5$) is greater than or equal to $5$, the hundreds digit $8$ rounds up to $9$. Therefore, $18.4851$ rounded to the nearest hundredth is equal to $\\boxed{18.49}$.",
