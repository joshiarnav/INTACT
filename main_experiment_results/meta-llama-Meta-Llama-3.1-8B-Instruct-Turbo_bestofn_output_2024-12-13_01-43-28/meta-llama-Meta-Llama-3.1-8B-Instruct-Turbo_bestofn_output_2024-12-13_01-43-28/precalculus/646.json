    "To find the value of $x$ such that the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$ are orthogonal, we need to use the property of orthogonal vectors. \n\nTwo vectors are orthogonal if and only if their dot product is equal to zero. The dot product of two vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix}$ is given by $a \\cdot c + b \\cdot d$.\n\nIn this case, the dot product is\n$2 \\cdot x + 5 \\cdot (-3) = 0$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get \n$2x - 15 = 0$ \n\nTo solve for $x$, we add $15$ to both sides of the equation. \n$2x = 15$\n\nThen, we divide both sides of the equation by $2$. \n$x = \\frac{15}{2}$ \n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that makes the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$ orthogonal is $\\boxed{7.5}$.",
