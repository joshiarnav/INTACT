    "To evaluate the given expression, we need to simplify each power of i.\n\nRecall that i is the imaginary unit, which is defined as the square root of -1. Therefore, its powers repeat in a cycle:\n\ni^1 = i\ni^2 = -1\ni^3 = -i\ni^4 = 1\n\nAnd then the cycle repeats.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each power in the given expression:\n\ni^11 = i^(4*2 + 3) = (i^4)^2 * i^3 = 1^2 * (-i) = -i\n\ni^16 = i^(4*4) = (i^4)^4 = 1^4 = 1\n\ni^21 = i^(4*5 + 1) = (i^4)^5 * i = 1^5 * i = i\n\ni^26 = i^(4*6 + 2) = (i^4)^6 * i^2 = 1^6 * (-1) = -1\n\ni^31 = i^(4*7 + 3) = (i^4)^7 * i^3 = 1^7 * (-i) = -i\n\nNow, we can add the simplified powers:\n\n-i + 1 + i - 1 + (-i) = ?\n\nCombine the like terms: \n\n-i + i - i = -i (this is the -i term from i^11, i^21 and i^31)\n+1 - 1 = 0\n\nThe final result is -i + 0 = -i.\n\nIn the box format that you requested:\n \n$\\boxed{- i}$",
    "To evaluate this expression, we need to simplify each term using the properties of the imaginary unit $i$.\n\nRecall that $i^2 = -1$, $i^3 = -i$, $i^4 = 1$, and the cycle repeats every 4 powers.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify $i^{11}$\nSince the cycle repeats every 4 powers, we can divide 11 by 4 to find the remainder, which is 3. Therefore, $i^{11} = i^{(4 \\times 2) + 3} = (i^4)^2 \\times i^3 = i^3 = -i$\n\n### Step 2: Simplify $i^{16}$\nSince the cycle repeats every 4 powers, we can divide 16 by 4 to find the remainder, which is 0. Therefore, $i^{16} = i^{(4 \\times 4)} = (i^4)^4 = 1$\n\n### Step 3: Simplify $i^{21}$\nSince the cycle repeats every 4 powers, we can divide 21 by 4 to find the remainder, which is 1. Therefore, $i^{21} = i^{(4 \\times 5) + 1} = (i^4)^5 \\times i^1 = i$\n\n### Step 4: Simplify $i^{26}$\nSince the cycle repeats every 4 powers, we can divide 26 by 4 to find the remainder, which is 2. Therefore, $i^{26} = i^{(4 \\times 6) + 2} = (i^4)^6 \\times i^2 = -1$\n\n### Step 5: Simplify $i^{31}$\nSince the cycle repeats every 4 powers, we can divide 31 by 4 to find the remainder, which is 3. Therefore, $i^{31} = i^{(4 \\times 7) + 3} = (i^4)^7 \\times i^3 = i^3 = -i$\n\n### Combine the simplified terms\nNow, we combine the simplified terms to find the value of the expression:\n$i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31} = (-i) + 1 + i + (-1) + (-i) = -i + 1 + i - 1 - i$\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n$-i + i + (-i) = -i$ \n$1 + (-1) = 0$ \nThen, combining this with -i: \n1. The like terms: $-i + i$ \nHowever that leaves only the -i\nthen we combine that with 1 +(-1) which in this case is: 0. The -i + 0 is -i \nWe then combine like this: \n$i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31} = -i + i + (-i) + 0$\n\nNow we just have two elements: '-i' and 0. Let's simplify this:\n$-i + 0 = -i$ \n\nSo, the value of the expression is $\\boxed{-i}$."

  "critique": "1\n\nSolution 1 is more concise and easier to read. It directly addresses the problem and provides a clear step-by-step solution. Solution 2 is more verbose and uses unnecessary steps, making it harder to follow. However, both solutions arrive at the same correct answer.",
  "solution": "We know that by definition, $i^2=-1$, so $i^4=(-1)^2=1.$ More generally, for all integers k, $i^{4k}=(i^4)^k=1^k=1$.
