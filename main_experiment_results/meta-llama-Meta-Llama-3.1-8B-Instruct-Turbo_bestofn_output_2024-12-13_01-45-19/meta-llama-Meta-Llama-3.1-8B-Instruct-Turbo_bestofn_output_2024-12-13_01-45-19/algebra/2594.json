    "To find the first term of the geometric sequence, we need to understand the properties of a geometric sequence.\n\nIn a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor called the 'common ratio' (r). \n\nGiven that the third term is 12 and the fourth term is 16, we can express them as:\n\nTerm 3: a * r^2 = 12\nTerm 4: a * r^3 = 16\n\nwhere 'a' is the first term of the sequence.\n\nTo solve for 'r', we can divide the equation of the fourth term by the equation of the third term:\n\na * r^3 / (a * r^2) = 16 / 12\nr = 16 / 12\nr = 4 / 3\n\nNow that we have the common ratio, we can substitute it into the equation of the third term to solve for the first term 'a':\n\na * (4 / 3)^2 = 12\na * (16 / 9) = 12\na = 12 * (9 / 16)\na = 27 / 4\n\nSo, the first term of the geometric sequence is $\\boxed{27 / 4}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Recall the formula for a geometric sequence: \n   a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ...\n\n   where 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio.\n\n2. We are given the third and fourth terms of the geometric sequence: \n   - Third term (ar^2) = 12\n   - Fourth term (ar^3) = 16\n\n3. To find the common ratio 'r', we'll divide the fourth term by the third term:\n   r = 16 / 12\n   r = 4 / 3\n   'r' is the common ratio.\n\n4. Now that we have the common ratio, we can find the value of the third term in terms of the first term 'a' and 'r':\n   ar^2 = 12\n   a(4/3)^2 = 12\n   a * (16/9) = 12\n   a = 12 * (9/16)\n   a = 27/4\n   Now simplifying it to: \n   'a' = $\\boxed{6.75}$",
    "To find the first term of a geometric sequence, we need to recall the formula for a geometric sequence: $a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, and $r$ is the common ratio.\n\nGiven that the third term is 12 and the fourth term is 16, we can use this information to find the common ratio.\n\nThe formula for the nth term can be rearranged as follows:\n\n$a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}$\n\nFor the third term (n = 3) and the fourth term (n = 4), we have:\n\n$a_3 = a_1 \\cdot r^2$\n$a_4 = a_1 \\cdot r^3$\n\nUsing the given values, we can write:\n\n$a_1 \\cdot r^2 = 12$\n$a_1 \\cdot r^3 = 16$\n\nDividing the second equation by the first, we get:\n\n$\\frac{a_1 \\cdot r^3}{a_1 \\cdot r^2} = \\frac{16}{12}$\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n$r = \\frac{16}{12}$\n\n$r = \\frac{4}{3}$\n\nNow that we have the common ratio, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the first term. We'll use the third term:\n\n$a_1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n$a_1 \\cdot \\frac{16}{9} = 12$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac{9}{16}$, we get:\n\n$a_1 = 12 \\cdot \\frac{9}{16}$\n\n$a_1 = \\frac{108}{16}$\n\n$a_1 = \\frac{27}{4}$\n\nTherefore, the first term of the sequence is $\\boxed{27/4}$"

  "solution": "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence. Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$. Solving, we have $a\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",
