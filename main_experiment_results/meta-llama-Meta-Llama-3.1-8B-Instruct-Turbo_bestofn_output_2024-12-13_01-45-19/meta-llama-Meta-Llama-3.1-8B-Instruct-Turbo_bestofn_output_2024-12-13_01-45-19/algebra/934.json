    "To solve for the value of $a$, we'll start by using the given information about the parabola's vertex. The vertex form of a parabola is:\n\ny = a(x - h)^2 + k\n\nwhere the vertex is $(h, k)$. In this case, the vertex is $(-4, 0)$, so we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\ny = a(x + 4)^2 + 0\ny = a(x + 4)^2\n\nNow, we know that the parabola passes through the point $(1, -75)$. We can substitute these values into the equation as well:\n\n-75 = a(1 + 4)^2\n-75 = a(5)^2\n-75 = 25a\n\nTo solve for $a$, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 25:\n\na = -75 / 25\na = -3\n\nSo, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{-3}$.",
    "To find the value of $a$, we can use the given information about the vertex and the point through which the parabola passes.\n\nStep 1: Use the vertex form of a parabola $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$ where $(h,k)$ is the vertex. \nThe vertex form of our parabola is $y = a(x + 4)^2$ because the vertex is $(-4,0)$.\n\nStep 2: We can substitute the point $(1,-75)$ into the equation to solve for $a$. \nPlugging in the point gives us $-75 = a(1 + 4)^2 = a(5)^2 = 25a$.\n\nStep 3: Now, solve for $a$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $25$.\nSolving for $a$ gives us $a = \\frac{-75}{25} = -3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-3}$",
    "To find the value of $a$, we need to use the given information about the vertex and the point on the parabola. \n\nFirst, let's recall that the equation of a parabola with vertex $(h, k)$ can be written in the form:\n\\[y = a(x - h)^2 + k\\]\n\nIn this case, the vertex is $(-4, 0)$, so we can write the equation as:\n\\[y = a(x + 4)^2\\]\n\nNow, we know that the parabola passes through the point $(1, -75)$. We can substitute this point into the equation to solve for $a$:\n\\[-75 = a(1 + 4)^2\\]\n\\[-75 = a(5)^2\\]\n\\[-75 = 25a\\]\n\nNow, we can solve for $a$:\n\\[a = \\frac{-75}{25}\\]\n\\[a = -3\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{-3}$."

  "solution": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic must be of the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$.  The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, which gives us the equation $-75 = 25a$.  Hence, $a = -75/25 = \\boxed{-3}$.",
