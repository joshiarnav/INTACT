    "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $7!$ and $(5!)^2$, let's first calculate the values of these numbers.\n\n$7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 7,  120.$\n\n$(5!)^2 = (5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1)^2 = 5,120.$\n\nNow, let's simplify the problem. We can start by expressing both numbers as a product of their prime factors.\n\n$7! = 7,120 = 2^4 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7$\n\n$(5!)^2 = 5,120 = 2^8 \\times 5^2$\n\nThe greatest common divisor will be the product of the common prime factors raised to the smallest exponent.\n\nThe common prime factors between $7!$ and $(5!)^2$ are $2$ and $5$. However, since the exponent of $2$ is $4$ in $7!$, we will only use this exponent. In the case of $5$, the exponent is $1$ for $7!$, but the exponent is $2$ for $(5!)^2$; we will use the exponent of $1$ for $7!$. \n\nSo, the GCD will be the product of $2^4$, $5^1$, and $1$ for the other prime factors that are not present in the $(5!)^2$ expression ($3$ and $7$). Therefore, the GCD will be $2^4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 80.$\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{80}$",
