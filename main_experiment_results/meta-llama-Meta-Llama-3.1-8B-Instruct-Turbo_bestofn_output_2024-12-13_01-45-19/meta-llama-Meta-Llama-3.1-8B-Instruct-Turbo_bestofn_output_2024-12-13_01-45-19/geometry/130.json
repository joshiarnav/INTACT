    "To solve this problem, we'll first find $\\angle PRQ$. We can do this by subtracting the given angles from $180^\\circ$ since the sum of the interior angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$. \n\n$\\angle PRQ = 180 - \\angle PQR - \\angle QPR = 180 - 63 - 59 = 58^\\circ$\n\nSince the circle's center $C$ is the incenter of triangle $PQR$, the line segment $CR$ is the angle bisector of $\\angle PRQ$. This is a property of the incenter of a triangle. Therefore, we can find $\\angle QRC$ by bisecting $\\angle PRQ$.\n\n$\\angle QRC = \\frac{1}{2}\\angle PRQ = \\frac{1}{2}(58) = 29^\\circ$\n\nSo, the value of $\\angle QRC$ is $\\boxed{29}$.",
    "To find the measure of angle $\\angle QRC$, we need to use the properties of the incenter and the angles of a triangle.\n\nFirst, we know that the incenter of a triangle is equidistant from all sides of the triangle, which is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. \n\nLet's start with $\\angle PQR = 63^\\circ$. Since the circle is inscribed within the triangle and $\\angle PQR$ is adjacent to the radius $CR$, the measure of $\\angle CRQ$ will be half the measure of $\\angle PQR$. Hence, $\\angle CRQ = 63^\\circ / 2 = 31.5^\\circ$.\n\nNext, since the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we can use this fact to find $\\angle PRQ$. \n\n$\\angle PRQ = 180^\\circ - \\angle PQR - \\angle QPR$\n$= 180^\\circ - 63^\\circ - 59^\\circ$\n$= 58^\\circ$\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the incenter of a triangle is equidistant from all sides. This means that line segment $CR$ will bisect $\\angle PRQ$, dividing it into two equal angles.\n\n$\\angle QRC + \\angle PCR = 58^\\circ / 2 = 29^\\circ$\n\nWe already calculated $\\angle CRQ = 31.5^\\circ$. Thus, we can easily solve for $\\angle QRC$.\nSince $\\angle PCR + \\angle CRQ = 180^\\circ - \\angle QRC$, then by substitution, $\\angle PCR + 31.5^\\circ = 180^\\circ - \\angle QRC$ will become $29^\\circ + 31.5^\\circ = 60.5^\\circ$ is basically being squeezed to give it more context, but will be deducted.\n\nThen\n$180^\\circ - 60.5^\\circ = 119.5^\\circ$.\nRearraging the equation then gives that\n$\\boxed{\\angle QRC} = 180^\\circ - 119.5^\\circ$\nor,  $\\boxed{\\angle QRC} = 60.5^\\circ$."
