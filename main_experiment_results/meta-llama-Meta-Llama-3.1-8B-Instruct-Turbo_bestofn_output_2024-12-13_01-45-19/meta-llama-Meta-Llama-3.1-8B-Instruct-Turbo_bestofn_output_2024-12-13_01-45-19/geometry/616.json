    "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to find the largest possible value of x.\n\nAccording to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the given triangle:\n\n1. The sum of the lengths of the two known sides (5 and 6) must be greater than the length of the third side (x).\n   5 + 6 > x\n   11 > x\n\n2. The sum of the length of one known side (5) and the third side (x) must be greater than the length of the other known side (6).\n   5 + x > 6\n   x > 1\n\n3. The sum of the length of one known side (6) and the third side (x) must be greater than the length of the other known side (5).\n   6 + x > 5\n   x > -1\n\nSince x is an integer, the smallest possible value of x is 2 (from x > 1).\n\nNow, let's consider the largest possible value of x. Since 11 > x, the largest possible value of x is 10.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the triangle is valid when x = 10. Apply the triangle inequality theorem again:\n1. 5 + 6 > 10 (True)\n2. 5 + 10 > 6 (True)\n3. 6 + 10 > 5 (True)\n\nSince all the inequalities are true, the triangle is valid when x = 10.\n\nThe largest possible perimeter of the triangle is the sum of all the sides:\nPerimeter = 5 + 6 + 10\nPerimeter = 21\n\nTherefore, the largest possible perimeter of the triangle is $\\boxed{21}$.",
    "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to consider the Triangle Inequality Theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nGiven sides of length 5 and 6 units, the third side is $x$ units. We need to satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. $x + 5 > 6$\n2. $x + 6 > 5$\n3. $5 + 6 > x$\n\nSimplify these conditions:\n\n1. $x > 1$\n2. $x > -1$ (this condition is always true for positive x)\n3. $11 > x$\n\nCombine the first and last conditions:\n\n1. $1 < x < 5.5$\n\nSince $x$ is an integer, the possible values of $x$ are 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nTo find the largest possible perimeter, we need to consider the sum of all sides with $x$ being the largest integer:\n\nPerimeter = 5 (side 1) + 6 (side 2) + 5 (largest possible x)\n\nThe largest possible perimeter = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16 units.\n\nSo, the largest possible perimeter of the triangle is $\\boxed{16}$.",
    "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to first establish the constraints on the length of the third side. \n\nThe triangle inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. \n\nIn this case, we have two constraints:\n1. The sum of the lengths of the sides of length 5 and 6 must be greater than the length of the third side.\n2. The sum of the lengths of the third side and one of the other sides must be greater than the length of the other side.\n\nLet's apply the first constraint: \n5 + 6 > x\n11 > x\n\nThis means that the third side must be shorter than 11 units.\n\nThe second constraint is: \nx + 5 > 6\nx > 1\n\nThis means that the third side must be longer than 1 unit.\n\nCombining these constraints, we get:\n1 < x < 11\n\nSince x is an integer, the possible values for x are: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nTo find the largest possible perimeter, we should choose the largest value of x that satisfies the constraints. \n\nThe largest value of x is 10.\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is: \nP = 5 + 6 + 10\nP = 21\n\nSo, the largest possible perimeter of the triangle is $\\boxed{21}$."

  "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",
