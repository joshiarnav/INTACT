    "To find the volume of the sphere, we first need to find the radius. We are given the surface area, which is $324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$.\n\nThe formula for the surface area of a sphere is $4\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere. We can set up an equation:\n\n$4\\pi r^2 = 324\\pi$\n\nNow, let's divide both sides by $4\\pi$:\n\n$r^2 = 81$\n\nNext, we take the square root of both sides:\n\n$r = \\pm 9$\n\nSince a radius cannot be negative, the radius of the sphere is $9\\text{ cm}$.\n\nNow that we know the radius, we can find the volume of the sphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$. We can substitute the radius $r = 9$ into this formula:\n\nVolume $= \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\cdot 9^3$\n\n$= \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\cdot 729$\n\n$= 972\\pi$\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is $\\boxed{972\\pi \\text{ cm}^3}$.",

  "solution": "Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2.\\]  Solving for $r$ and keeping the positive value yields $r^2=81$, so $r = 9$.  Hence the volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=81\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\pi = \\boxed{972\\pi}.\\]",
