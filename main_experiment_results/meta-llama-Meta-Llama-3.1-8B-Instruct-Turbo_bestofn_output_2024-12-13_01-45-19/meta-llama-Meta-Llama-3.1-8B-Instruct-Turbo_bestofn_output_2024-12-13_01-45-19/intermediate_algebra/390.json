    "To find the slant asymptote, we will divide the numerator by the denominator using long division or synthetic division. \n\n1. Divide $2x^2$ by $x$, which gives $2x$. \nMultiply the divisor $x - 3$ by $2x$ to get $2x^2 - 6x$.\nSubtract this from the numerator $2x^2 + 3x - 7$.\nThis results in $9x - 7$.\n\n2. Now, divide $9x$ by $x$, which gives $9$. \n Multiply the divisor $x - 3$ by $9$ to get $9x - 27$.\nSubtract this from the resulting expression $9x - 7$.\nThis results in $20$.\n\nSo, $y = 2x + 9 + \\frac{20}{x - 3}$. \n\nSince the question asks for the slant asymptote, we will consider the part that is a linear function of $x$, which is $y = 2x + 9$. \n\nWe are need to find $m+b$ for this line. $m$ is the coefficient of $x$, which is $2$, and $b$ is the constant term, which is $9$.\n\nSo, $m + b = 2 + 9 = 11$. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{11}$.",
    "To find the slant asymptote, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator. \n\nSince the denominator is of degree 1, and the numerator is of degree 2, we're not looking for a remainder, just the quotient in the form of $mx + b$.\n\nPerforming the long division or synthetic division:\n\n1. Divide the leading term of the numerator (2x^2) by the leading term of the denominator (x), we get 2x.\n\n2. Multiply 2x by the denominator x - 3 to get 2x^2 - 6x and subtract it from 2x^2 + 3x - 7. \n\n3. Now, we get 9x - 7 as the new numerator.\n\n4. To divide 9x by x, we get 9.\n\n5. Multiply 9 by the denominator x - 3 to get 9x - 27 and subtract it from 9x - 7.\n\n6. The result is 20.\n\nSo, the quotient is 2x + 9, and that's our slant asymptote.\n\nTherefore, m + b is 2 + 9 = 11.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{11}$.",
    "To find the slant asymptote, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator. Since the degree of the numerator (2) is exactly one more than the degree of the denominator (1), there will be a linear remainder and the quotient will be a linear function, which is the slant asymptote.\n\nLong division of polynomials:\n\n1. Divide the leading term of the numerator ($2x^2$) by the leading term of the denominator ($x$), to get $2x$. Multiply the entire denominator by $2x$, which is $2x^2 - 6x$, and subtract this from the numerator ($2x^2 + 3x - 7$) to get a new polynomial.\n\n$2x^2 + 3x - 7 - (2x^2 - 6x) = 9x - 7$\n\n2. Now, divide the leading term of the new polynomial ($9x$) by the leading term of the denominator ($x$), to get $9$. Multiply the entire denominator by $9$, which is $9x - 27$, and subtract this from the new polynomial ($9x - 7$) to get the remainder, which is $20$.\n\n$9x - 7 - (9x - 27) = 20$\n\nSo, the quotient is $y = 2x + 9$, and the remainder is $20$. Therefore, the equation can be written as:\n\n$y = (2x + 9) + \\frac{20}{x-3}$\n\nAs $x$ approaches $\\infty$ or $-\\infty$, the term $\\frac{20}{x-3}$ approaches $0$, and the line $y = 2x + 9$ remains. This is the slant asymptote of the given rational expression.\n\nSince the slant asymptote is a linear function of the form $y = mx + b$, where $m = 2$ and $b = 9$, the sum of $m$ and $b$ is:\n\n$m + b = 2 + 9 = 11$\n\nTherefore, $m + b = 11$. \n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{11}$"

  "solution": "To approach this problem, we can either use long division or synthetic division to evaluate the quotient of the given rational expression. Alternatively, we can rewrite the numerator as $2x^2 + 3x - 7$ $ = 2x^2 + 3x - 7 - 9x + 9x$ $ = 2x(x-3) + 9x - 7 - 20 + 20$ $ = 2x(x-3) + 9(x-3) + 20$. Hence, $$y = \\frac{2x^2 + 3x - 7}{x-3} = \\frac{(2x+9)(x-3) + 20}{x-3} = 2x+9 +\\frac{20}{x-3}.$$As $x$ approaches infinity or negative infinity, then the fraction approaches $0$, and $y$ approaches $2x + 9$.Thus, $m+b = \\boxed{11}.$ [asy]\nimport graph; size(7cm); real lsf=0.5; pen dps=linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10); defaultpen(dps); pen ds=black; real xmin=-27.84,xmax=46.9,ymin=-33.28,ymax=45.43;\n\nLabel laxis; laxis.p=fontsize(10);\n\nxaxis(xmin,xmax,Ticks(laxis,Step=20.0,Size=2,NoZero),Arrows(6),above=true); yaxis(ymin,ymax,Ticks(laxis,Step=20.0,Size=2,NoZero),Arrows(6),above=true); real f1(real x){return (2*x^2+3*x-7)/(x-3);} draw(graph(f1,-27.83,2.99),linewidth(1)); draw(graph(f1,3.01,46.89),linewidth(1)); draw((xmin,2*xmin+9)--(xmax,2*xmax+9), linetype(\"2 2\"));\n\nlabel(\"$y = \\frac{2x^2 + 3x - 7}{x - 3}$\",(5.67,-27.99),NE*lsf); label(\"$y = 2x + 9$\",(18.43,35.5),NE*lsf);\n\nclip((xmin,ymin)--(xmin,ymax)--(xmax,ymax)--(xmax,ymin)--cycle);\n\n[/asy]",
