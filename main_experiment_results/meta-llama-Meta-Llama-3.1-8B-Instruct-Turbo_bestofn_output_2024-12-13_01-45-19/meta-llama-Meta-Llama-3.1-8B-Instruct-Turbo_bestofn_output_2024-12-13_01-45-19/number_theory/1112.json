    "We can start by analyzing the problem in base 6, as indicated by the subscript 6. \n\nFirst, let's focus on the rightmost column. We have $\\triangle + 0 + 2 \\equiv 1$ (mod 6). However, this equation doesn't make sense as 2+0 already equates to 2, not 1 in mod 6, nor base 6. Let's re evaluate our initial understanding. The correct equation for this column is $\\triangle + 2 = 11_6$, where 1 is in the units column and the 1 from the right is carried over to the next column. \n\nNow, converting 11 base 6 to base 10 we get 7 (for the equation: $\\triangle + 2$ = 7). Since we are working in mod 6 we will return to base 6 to find our solutions. Since in base 6 if you have 7 as a sum from $\\ \\triangle + 2$ then it implies $\\triangle + 2 \\equiv 7 = 11_6$ which again will be translated to base 10 for final conversion back to base 6. \n\nRewriting our equation we have $\\triangle + 2 \\equiv 1 + 10 = 11_6$ in base 10 which we already converted when finding out what numbers equated to in base 10. Upon returning $\\triangle$ to its original base we find its base 10: base 6 relation $\\triangle$ = 5 also because 5 base 10 in base 6 as a single digit equates to 5 which also equates to 5.\n\nTherefore, the value of $\\triangle$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "To solve for the value of $\\triangle$, let's analyze each column of the addition problem from right to left, taking into account that the numbers are in base 6.\n\nStarting from the rightmost column, we have $\\triangle + 0 + 2 = 1_6$. Since we are working in base 6, the sum of two numbers cannot exceed 5 (the highest digit in base 6). Therefore, $\\triangle + 2$ must be equal to 1 or 7 in base 10. \n\nHowever, since we are working in base 6, $\\triangle + 2$ can only equal 1 in base 6, if we translate 7 to base 6 then we get 11. This indicates that the sum would carry over to the next column.\n\nTherefore, we have two possible results in base 6:\n\nEither, $\\triangle + 2 = 11_6$, which means $\\triangle + 2 = 1 + 6 = 7$ in base 10.\n\nOr, $\\triangle + 2 = 1_6$ (no carry), which we will analyze as the next step.\n\nLooking at the second rightmost column, we have $\\triangle + 4 + \\triangle = \\triangle_6$. There are two possible ways to read the second rightmost column. We'll explore them each for possible values of $\\triangle_6$ as $\\triangle + 4$ since it can produce a carry (base 6):\n\nGiven that the first read is  $\\triangle + 4 = \\triangle$ then this becomes (viewing the carry to the third column now) $$7+ \\triangle+ 2 =  \\triangle$$ which then means $\\triangle = - 5$. This isn't a valid answer because, with base values starting from 0 not 1 in base 6 (base 10 $\\triangle$ cannot go lower than 0).\n\nThe valid read of the equation will be  $\\triangle + 4 +\\triangle =  \\triangle +  6$ \n\nHowever, if we treat $\\triangle + 4 +\\triangle =  \\triangle + 6$, then we find that this isn't a proper equation based off the fact that $\\triangle + 4 + \\triangle =  \\triangle + 6 + 1$ (the 1 comes from the fact that $\\triangle + 2$ must equal $1_6$). \n\nThus the true equation will be  $\\triangle + 4 + \\triangle =  7 + 1$. This means $\\triangle = 6$. However since we cannot exceed six in base 6 $\\triangle$ would be equal to 4 if we translate our newly found base 6 value into base 10, $\\triangle = 4$.\n\nHowever, the question, with our calculated $\\triangle + 2 = 1_6$, stated that the sum must be 11 base 6 or 7 base 10. On that 7 base 10 note, then we also then need to analyze $\\triangle + 2 = 7$. With this in mind we now need to see what $\\triangle$ is once we look at $\\triangle + 4 + \\triangle = \\triangle + 60$.\n\nNow we have $\\triangle = 5$ and that, with a $\\triangle$ value at 5, does meet the base 6 $\\triangle + 2$ must be 7 and it meets it at $5+ 2$ which equals $1 (base 6) 7 (base 10)$.\n\nThese two $\\triangle$ answers mean  $\\triangle = 4, \\triangle = 5$. Looking at the third column from the right we have $1 + \\triangle + \\triangle = 4_6$. The only way that this will be possible is if $\\triangle = 4$.\n\nWe can rule out $\\triangle = 5$ because if $\\triangle = 5$ then $1 + 5 + 5 = 12$ which equals to 20 in base 6 but, $20_6 = 10, 1$ not $4$ ($\\triangle = 5$ has already been ruled out).\n\nSo the answer should be $\\boxed{4}$."
