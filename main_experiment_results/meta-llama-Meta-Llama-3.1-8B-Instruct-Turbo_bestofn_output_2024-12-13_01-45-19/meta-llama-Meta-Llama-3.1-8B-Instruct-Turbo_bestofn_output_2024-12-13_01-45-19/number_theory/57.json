    "To find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, let's consider their values in terms of the divisor $24$ and the remainders $10,$ $4,$ and $12$. \n\nLet the first integer be $24a+10$, the second be $24b+4$, and the third be $24c+12$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are non-negative integers. \n\nWhen we sum these three integers, we get:\n\n$(24a+10) + (24b+4) + (24c+12) = 24a + 24b + 24c + 26$\n\nWe can then factor out the $24$ from the first three terms:\n\n$24a + 24b + 24c + 26 = 24(a+b+c) + 26$\n\nNow, let's divide $26$ by $24$ to find the remainder:\n\n$26 = 24 \\times 1 + 2$\n\nThis tells us that $26$ leaves a remainder of $2$ when divided by $24$.\n\nTherefore, when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, the remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we can think of the three integers as $24a + 10$, $24b + 4$, and $24c + 12$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers. \n\nThe sum of these three integers is\n\n$(24a + 10) + (24b + 4) + (24c + 12)$\n\nCombine like terms to get\n\n$24a + 24b + 24c + 10 + 4 + 12$\n\n$= 24(a + b + c) + 26$\n\n$= 24(a + b + c) + 24 + 2$\n\nNow, when this sum is divided by $24$, the term $24(a + b + c)$ will be divisible by $24$ and will leave a remainder of $0$. This means that the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$ is the same as the remainder when $24 + 2$ is divided by $24$, which is $2$. \n\nSo, the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$ is $\\boxed{2}$",
    "To find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24, we need to consider the remainders of each integer when divided by 24.\n\nLet the three integers be $a,$ $b,$ and $c$.
