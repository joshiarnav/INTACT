    "To find the minimum number of dimes that Chloe needs to buy the hoodie, we need to calculate the remaining amount after she uses all her $\\$10$ bills and quarters. \n\n1. She has three $\\$10$ bills: $3 \\times \\$10 = \\$30$.\n\n2. Now, she needs to pay $\\$32.75 - \\$30 = \\$2.75$.\n\n3. She has eight quarters: $8 \\times \\$0.25 = \\$2$.\n\n4. After using the quarters, she still needs to pay $\\$2.75 - \\$2 = \\$0.75$.\n\n5. Since a dime is worth $\\$0.10$, we need to find the number of dimes to pay for the remaining $\\$0.75$.\n\n6. We can divide $\\$0.75$ by $\\$0.10$ to find the number of dimes needed: $\\frac{\\$0.75}{\\$0.10} = 7.5$.\n\n7. Since there must be a whole number of dimes, and we know that 7 dimes will be less than $\\$0.75$, Chloe must have at least 8 dimes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of dimes that Chloe must have is $\\boxed{8}$.",
