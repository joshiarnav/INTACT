    "To find the area of the region $S'$, we need to consider the effect of the given matrix on the area of $S$. When a matrix is applied to a region in the plane, the area is scaled by a factor equal to the magnitude of the determinant of the matrix.\n\nThe given matrix is:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ 7 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nFirst, we need to find the determinant of this matrix. The determinant of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ is given by $ad - bc$. \n\nFor our matrix, $a = 2$, $b = -1$, $c = 7$, and $d = 2$. \n\nTherefore, the determinant is $(2)(2) - (-1)(7) = 4 + 7 = 11$.\n\nThe magnitude of the determinant is $|11| = 11$.\n\nSince the area of $S$ is 4, the area of $S'$ will be $11$ times the area of $S$. \n\nArea of $S'$ = $11 \\times 4 = 44$\n\nTherefore, the area of $S'$ is $\\boxed{44}$.",
