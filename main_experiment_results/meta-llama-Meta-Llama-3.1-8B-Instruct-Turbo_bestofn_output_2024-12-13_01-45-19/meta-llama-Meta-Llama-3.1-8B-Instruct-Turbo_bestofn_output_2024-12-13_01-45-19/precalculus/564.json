    "To dilate a point, we first need to translate it so that the center of dilation is at the origin, then multiply by the scale factor, and then translate it back.\n\nStep 1: Translation to move the center of dilation to the origin\nThe center of dilation is $-1 + 4i$. We need to translate the point $2i$ by the opposite of the center, which is $1 - 4i$. We do the same for our dilation point, which is then $2i + (1 - 4i)$ = $1 - 2i$.\n\nStep 2: Multiplication by the scale factor\nNow that the center is at the origin, we can multiply the point by the scale factor. The scale factor is -2, so we multiply $1 - 2i$ by $-2$. This results in $-2 + 4i$.\n\nStep 3: Translation to move the dilation point to the original position\nNow that we've multiplied by the scale factor, we need to translate the point back by the center of dilation. This means adding $1 - 4i$ to $-2 + 4i$. This results in $-2 + 4i + 1 - 4i$ = $-1$.\n\nSo, the dilation takes $2i$ to $\\boxed{-1}$.",
    "To dilate a complex number, we first need to translate the complex number so that the center of dilation becomes the origin, then we multiply the translated number by the scale factor, and finally we translate the complex number back to its original position.\n\nGiven that the center of dilation is $-1 + 4i$ and the scale factor is $-2$, let's first translate the complex number $2i$ so that the center of dilation becomes the origin.\n\nLet's denote the translation as $w$. To translate a complex number to bring the center of dilation $-1 + 4i$ to the origin, we subtract $-1 + 4i$ from $2i$. So the translation is:\n\n$$w = 2i - (-1 + 4i) = 2i + 1 - 4i = 1 - 2i.$$\n\nNow, we multiply the translated number $1 - 2i$ by the scale factor $-2$.\n\n$$(1 - 2i) \\times (-2) = -2 + 4i.$$\n\nThis is where the center of dilation is translated back to its original position.\n\nWe need to translate $-2 + 4i$ back by adding $-1 + 4i$ to it.\n\n$$(-2 + 4i) + (-1 + 4i) = (-2 - 1) + (4i + 4i) = -3 + 8i.$$\n\nTherefore, the complex number $2i$ is taken to $\\boxed{-3 + 8i}$."

  "critique": "The correct solution is Solution 2. Here's why:\n\nSolution 1 translates the point to the origin, multiplies it by the scale factor, and then translates it back. However, when translating it back to its original position, it incorrectly adds the center of dilation to the translated point, resulting in the wrong answer.\n\nSolution 2 correctly translates the point to the origin, multiplies it by the scale factor, and then translates it back by subtracting the center of dilation from the translated point, resulting in the correct answer.\n\nSo, the best solution is Solution 2, which is index 2. \n\nThe answer is 2.!",
