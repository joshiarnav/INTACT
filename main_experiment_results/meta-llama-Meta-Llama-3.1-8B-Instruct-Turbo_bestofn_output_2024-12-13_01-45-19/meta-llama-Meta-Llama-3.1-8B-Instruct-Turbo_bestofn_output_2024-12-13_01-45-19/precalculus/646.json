    "To find $x$ so that the vectors are orthogonal, we need to set up the equation for orthogonality. Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is 0. The dot product of two vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix}$ is $ac + bd$.\n\nLet's use this formula to find the dot product of the given vectors.\n\nDot product = $(2)(x) + (5)(-3)$\n\nTo find $x$, we set the dot product equal to 0 and solve for $x$:\n\n$(2)(x) + (5)(-3) = 0$\n\n$2x - 15 = 0$\n\n$2x = 15$\n\n$x = 15/2$\n\n$x = 7.5$\n\nSo, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{7.5}$.",
    "To find the value of $x$, we need to ensure that the dot product of the two vectors is zero. \n\nThe dot product of two vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix}$ is given by $ac + bd$.\n\nSo, for our vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$, the dot product is $(2)(x) + (5)(-3)$.\n\nWe want this dot product to be zero, so we set up the equation:\n\n$2x - 15 = 0$\n\nNow, the solution to this equation will give us the desired value of $x$. \n\nTo solve for $x$, we can first add $15$ to both sides of the equation to get:\n\n$2x = 15$\n\nThen, we can divide both sides by $2$ to get:\n\n$x = \\frac{15}{2}$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that ensures the vectors are orthogonal is $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{2}}$.",
