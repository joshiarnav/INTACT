    "To evaluate $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}$, we need to simplify each term using the properties of the imaginary unit $i$. \n\nRecall that $i^2 = -1$, $i^3 = -i$, $i^4 = 1$, and the pattern repeats every four powers. \n\n1. $i^{11}$: Since $i^{12} = 1$, we can write $i^{11}$ as $i^{4 \\cdot 2 + 3}$, which simplifies to $i^3$. We know that $i^3 = -i$, so $i^{11} = -i$.\n\n2. $i^{16}$: Since $i^{16}$ is a multiple of 4 (specifically, $i^{4 \\cdot 4}$), it simplifies to $1$. \n\n3. $i^{21}$: Since $i^{20} = 1$, we can write $i^{21}$ as $i^{1}$, which simplifies to $i$.\n\n4. $i^{26}$: Since $i^{24} = 1$, we can write $i^{26}$ as $i^{2}$. We know that $i^2 = -1$, so $i^{26} = -1$.\n\n5. $i^{31}$: Since $i^{28} = 1$, we can write $i^{31}$ as $i^{3}$. We know that $i^3 = -i$, so $i^{31} = -i$.\n\nNow that we have simplified each term, we can add them together:\n\n$i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31} = -i + 1 + i - 1 - i$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$-i + i - i = -i$\n\n$1 - 1 = 0$\n\nSo, the sum is $-i + 0 = -i$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{-i}$.",

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, we will evaluate each solution based on its clarity, correctness, and adherence to the problem-solving process.\n\nSolution 1 is clear and concise, and it correctly simplifies each term using the properties of the imaginary unit i.

However, it introduces an error when combining the terms, which is later corrected. The solution could be improved by being more careful when combining the terms.\n\nSolution 3 is clear and concise, and it correctly simplifies each term using the properties of the imaginary unit i. It also properly combines like terms to arrive at the final answer.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, Solution 1 and Solution 3 are the best solutions. They are both clear, concise, and correct. However, Solution 1 is slightly more concise and easier to follow.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1.\n\nThe answer is: 1",
  "solution": "We know that by definition, $i^2=-1$, so $i^4=(-1)^2=1.$ More generally, for all integers k, $i^{4k}=(i^4)^k=1^k=1$. This means that $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}= i^8(i^3)+i^{16}(1)+i^{20}(i)+i^{24}(i^2)+i^{28}(i^3)=i^3+1+i+i^2+i^3$.
