    "To find the first term of a geometric sequence, we can use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence: $a_n = a_1 * r^{(n-1)}$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, and r is the common ratio.\n\nGiven the third and fourth terms, we can write the following equations:\n\n$a_3 = a_1 * r^2 = 12$\n$a_4 = a_1 * r^3 = 16$\n\nWe can divide the second equation by the first to eliminate $a_1$:\n\n$\\frac{a_1 * r^3}{a_1 * r^2} = \\frac{16}{12}$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$r = \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$\n\nNow that we have the common ratio, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for $a_1$. We'll use the first equation:\n\n$a_1 * r^2 = 12$\n$a_1 * (\\frac{4}{3})^2 = 12$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$a_1 * \\frac{16}{9} = 12$\n\nMultiply both sides by $\\frac{9}{16}$ to solve for $a_1$:\n\n$a_1 = 12 * \\frac{9}{16}$\n$a_1 = \\frac{108}{16}$\n$a_1 = \\frac{27}{4}$\n\nSo, the first term of the geometric sequence is $\\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",
    "To find the first term of the geometric sequence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Understand the geometric sequence formula: The nth term of a geometric sequence can be found using the formula: \n   an = ar^(n-1), \n   where 'a' is the first term, 'r' is the common ratio, and 'n' is the term number.\n\n2. We are given the third and fourth terms of the sequence: \n   a3 = 12 and a4 = 16.\n\n3. We can write the equations using the formula for the nth term:\n   a3 = ar^(3-1) = ar^2 = 12,\n   a4 = ar^(4-1) = ar^3 = 16.\n\n4. Now, we can divide the equation for a4 by the equation for a3 to eliminate 'a' and find the common ratio 'r':\n   (ar^3) / (ar^2) = (16) / (12)\n   r = (16) / (12)\n   r = (4/3)\n\n   However, in this case, dividing the two terms directly will also give us the correct answer, however with a simpler calculation:\n   Since a3 = ar^2 and a4 = ar^3 we can directly divide a4 by a3 as r^3/r^2 (r^(3-2)) = r to obtain the common ratio:\n   r = a4/a3 = 16/12 \n   r = 4/3\n\n5. Now that we have the common ratio 'r', we can substitute it back into one of the equations for the third or fourth term to find the first term 'a':\n   We will use a3 = ar^2 = 12. Replace r with 4/3:\n   a(4/3)^2 = 12\n   a(16/9) = 12\n   To solve for 'a', multiply both sides by 9/16:\n   a = 12 * (9/16)\n\n6. Simplify the multiplication:\n   a = 108/16\n   a = 27/4\n\nSo, the first term of the sequence is: \n   $\\boxed{27/4}$"

  "critique": "Based on the two solution attempts, I would rate Solution 1 as the best solution. \n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Solution 1 is more concise and easier to follow. It directly addresses the problem and uses the given information to find the common ratio and the first term.\n2. Solution 1 uses a more efficient method to find the common ratio by dividing the equation for the fourth term by the equation for the third term. This eliminates the need for a direct division of the terms, which can be prone to errors.\n3. Solution 1 uses algebraic manipulation to solve for the first term, which is a clear and straightforward approach.\n4. Solution 2, on the other hand, uses a more circuitous approach to find the common ratio and the first term. While it ultimately arrives at the same answer, the steps are more convoluted and may be more prone to errors.\n\nTherefore, I would rate Solution 1 as the best solution, and the index number is: 1.",
  "solution": "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence. Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$. Solving, we have $a\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",
