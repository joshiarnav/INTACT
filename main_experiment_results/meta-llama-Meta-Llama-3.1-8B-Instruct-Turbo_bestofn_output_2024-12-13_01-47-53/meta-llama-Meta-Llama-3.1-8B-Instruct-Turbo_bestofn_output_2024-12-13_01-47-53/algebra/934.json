    "To find the value of $a$, we can use the given information about the vertex and the point it passes through to find the equation of the parabola in the form $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola.\n\nGiven that the vertex is $(-4, 0)$, we can plug in these values into the equation and get: \n\n$y = a(x - (-4))^2 + 0$\n$y = a(x + 4)^2$\n\nNow, we know that this parabola passes through the point $(1, -75)$.

    "To find the value of 'a', we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Use the vertex form of a quadratic equation**: Since we're given the vertex of the parabola $(-4,0)$, we can write the quadratic equation in vertex form:\n\n   $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$\n\n   where $(h, k)$ is the vertex. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n   $y = a(x + 4)^2$\n\n2. **Expand the equation and compare with the standard quadratic form**: We can expand the vertex form to compare it with the standard form of a quadratic equation:\n\n   $y = a(x^2 + 8x + 16)$\n\n   Expanding further:\n\n   $y = ax^2 + 8ax + 16a$\n\n3. **Use the given point to find 'a'**: Since the parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\n   $-75 = a(1)^2 + 8a(1) + 16a$\n\n   Simplifying:\n\n   $-75 = a + 8a + 16a$\n\n4. **Combine like terms and solve for 'a'**: Combine like terms:\n\n   $-75 = 25a$\n\n   Divide both sides by $25$ to solve for 'a':\n\n   $a = \\frac{-75}{25}$\n\n   $a = -3$\n\nSo, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{-3}$."

  "solution": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic must be of the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$.  The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, which gives us the equation $-75 = 25a$.  Hence, $a = -75/25 = \\boxed{-3}$.",
