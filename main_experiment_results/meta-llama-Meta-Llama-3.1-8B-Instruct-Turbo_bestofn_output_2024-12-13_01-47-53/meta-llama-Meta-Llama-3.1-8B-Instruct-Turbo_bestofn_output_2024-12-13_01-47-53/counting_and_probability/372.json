    "If Cara is sitting at the table, there are 5 friends to choose from as the person to her left, and 4 friends to choose from as the person to her right. This results in a total of:\n\n$5 \\times 4 = 20$ pairs\n\nHowever, we need to divide this by 2 since choosing friend A to the left of Cara and friend B to the right is equivalent to choosing friend B to the left and friend A to the right. \n\n$\\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$\n\nSo, there are $\\boxed{10}$ different possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between.",
    "To find the number of different possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between, we need to consider that Cara has 5 friends, and she can sit between any two of them. \n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 friends out of 5 can be found using the combination formula: $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items being chosen. In this case, n = 5 (the number of friends), and r = 2 (the number of friends Cara sits between).\n\nSo, the number of different possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between is:\n\n$\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{120}{2 \\times 6} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10$\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "To find the number of different possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between, let's consider the total number of her friends. We know there are 5 friends in total. \n\nNow, when we are choosing the pair that Cara is sitting between, we need to consider 2 of the five friends. The order of choosing these friends does not matter, as the pair between Cara is the same regardless of their order.\n\nThus, the number of possible pairs of people that Cara could be sitting between is given by the combination of 5 friends taken 2 at a time, denoted as $\\binom{5}{2}.$ \n\nAlso, recall that the formula for combination (denoted as $\\binom{n}{r}$) is:\n$\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$\n\nIn our case, $n=5$ and $r=2$.\n\nPlugging these in, we get $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!}.$ \n\nWe can now simplify the factorial terms in the formula:\n$\\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5*4*3!}{2!3!}.$\n\nNow, cancel the common $3!$ terms in the numerator and denominator: \n$\\frac{5*4*3!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5*4}{2!}.$\n\nAlso, recall the value of $2! = 2*1 = 2.$ \n\nTherefore, we can simplify the expression further: \n$\\frac{5*4}{2!} = \\frac{5*4}{2}.$\n\nSimplifying the fraction by dividing 5*4 by 2 yields the result:\n$\\frac{5*4}{2} = 10.$\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{10}.$"
