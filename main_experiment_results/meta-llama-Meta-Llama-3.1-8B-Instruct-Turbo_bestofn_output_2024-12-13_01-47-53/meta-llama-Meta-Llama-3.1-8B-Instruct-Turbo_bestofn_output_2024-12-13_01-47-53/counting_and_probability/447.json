    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of combinations of 12 items taken 4 at a time, without considering the order. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to select, and '!' represents the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1).\n\nIn this case, n = 12 (total number of crayons) and k = 4 (number of crayons to select).\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4!(12-4)!)\n= 12! / (4!8!)\n= (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)\n= 11,880 / 24\n= 495\n\nSo, there are 495 ways Karl can select four crayons if the order in which he draws them out does not matter.\n\n$\\boxed{495}$",
    "To find the number of ways Karl can select four crayons from 12, we need to use the concept of combinations. \n\nSince the order does not matter, we will use the combination formula:\n\nNumber of combinations = C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of items (in this case, 12 crayons)\n- k is the number of items to select (in this case, 4 crayons)\n- '!' denotes the factorial of a number (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nNumber of combinations = C(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * (12 - 4)!)\n= 12! / (4! * 8!)\n= (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8!) / ((4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * 8!)\n= (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n= 11880 / 24\n= 495\n\nSo, Karl can select four crayons in 495 different ways.\n\n$\\boxed{495}$",
    "To find the number of ways Karl can select four crayons from 12, we need to use the concept of combinations. This is because the order in which he draws them out does not matter. \n\nStep 1: We know the total number of crayons is 12, and we want to select 4. \n\nStep 2: The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of items (12 crayons),\n- r is the number of items we want to select (4 crayons),\n- ! denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.\n\nStep 3: Plug the values into the combination formula:\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * (12-4)!)\n\nStep 4: Simplify the expression. \n\n12! = 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n(12-4)! = 8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n\nStep 5: Simplify the expression by canceling out the common terms:\n\nC(12, 4) = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\nC(12, 4) = 11,880 / 24\nC(12, 4) = 495\n\nSo, the answer is: \n$\\boxed{495}$"

  "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",
