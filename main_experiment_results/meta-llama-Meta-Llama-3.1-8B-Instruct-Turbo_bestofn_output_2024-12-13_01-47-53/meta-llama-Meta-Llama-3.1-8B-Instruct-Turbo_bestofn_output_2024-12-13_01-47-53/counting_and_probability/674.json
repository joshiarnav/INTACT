  "problem": "Crestview's school colors are purple and gold. The students are designing a flag using three solid-colored horizontal stripes, as shown. Using one or both of the school colors, how many different flags are possible if adjacent stripes may be the same color?\n\n[asy]\nsize(75);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,12));\ndot((0,12));\ndraw((0,12)--(8,12)--(8,11)--(0,11));\ndraw((8,11)--(8,9)--(0,9));\ndraw((8,9)--(8,6)--(0,6));\n[/asy]",

    "To determine the total number of different flag designs, let's consider the color possibilities for each horizontal stripe.\n\n1. For the top stripe, we have 2 options: purple or gold.\n2. For the middle stripe, we again have 2 options: purple or gold.\n3. For the bottom stripe, we have 2 options: purple or gold.\n\nSince the choice of color for each stripe is independent of the others, we can multiply the number of options for each stripe to find the total number of possible flag designs.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different flags possible using the school colors is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^3 = 8$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's consider the different possible color combinations for the three solid-colored horizontal stripes. \n\nThere are three positions on the flag for different colors: top, middle, and bottom. \n\nFor each position, there are two possible colors: purple (P) and gold (G). \n\nSo, for each position, there are 2 possible colors. \n\nUsing this information, we can determine the total number of possible flag combinations as follows:\n\nFor the top stripe, there are 2 possible colors.\nFor the middle stripe, there are 2 possible colors (regardless of what color the top stripe is).\nFor the bottom stripe, there are 2 possible colors (regardless of what colors the top and middle stripes are).\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible flag combinations is:\n\n2 (top stripe colors) * 2 (middle stripe colors) * 2 (bottom stripe colors)\n= 2 * 2 * 2\n= 8\n\nSo, there are 8 different possible flags that can be created using one or both of the school colors.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
    "To determine the total number of different flags possible, we can start by selecting the color of each stripe. \n\nThere are 3 stripes, so we can have the following combinations of colors: \n1. Purple (top and middle) and gold (bottom)\n2. Gold (top and middle) and purple (bottom)\n3. Purple (top and bottom) and gold (middle)\n4. Gold (top and bottom) and purple (middle)\n\nWe also have the option of having all the stripes the same color. Since there are 2 school colors (purple and gold), we can add 2 more to our list: \n1. Purple (top and middle) and gold (bottom)\n2. Gold (top and middle) and purple (bottom)\n3. Purple (top and middle) and purple (bottom) \n4. Gold (top and middle) and gold (bottom)\n5. Purple (top and bottom) and gold (middle)\n6. Gold (top and bottom) and purple (middle)\n7. Purple (top and middle) and purple (bottom) and top and middle and bottom\n8. Gold (top and middle) and gold (bottom) and top and middle and bottom\n\nAnd also we have: \n1. Purple (top) and purple (middle) and gold (bottom)\n2. Gold (top) and gold (middle) and purple (bottom)\n3. Gold (top) and purple (middle) and purple (bottom)\n4. Purple (top) and gold (middle) and gold (bottom)\n\nCombining all of these possibilities, we have the following total number of different flags:  12.\n\n$\\boxed{12}$"
