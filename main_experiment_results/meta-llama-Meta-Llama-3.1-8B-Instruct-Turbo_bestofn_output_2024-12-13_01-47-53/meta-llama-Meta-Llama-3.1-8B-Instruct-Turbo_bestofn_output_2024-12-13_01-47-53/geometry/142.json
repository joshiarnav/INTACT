    "To compute $\\sin 60^\\circ$, we need to recall a few trigonometric concepts and identities. \n\n**Step 1: Recall the definition of sine**\nSine is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite a given angle to the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with that angle.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle**\nA 30-60-90 triangle is a right triangle with angles measuring 30, 60, and 90 degrees. The side opposite the 30-degree angle is half the length of the hypotenuse, and the side opposite the 60-degree angle is $a\\sqrt{3}/2$ (where a is the side opposite the 30-degree angle).\n\n**Step 3: Use the 30-60-90 triangle to find the value of sin 60\u00b0**\nUsing the 30-60-90 triangle, we know that the side opposite the 30-degree angle is half the length of the hypotenuse. Let's say the hypotenuse has length 2 (we can choose any unit of length, so let's choose 2 for simplicity). Then the side opposite the 30-degree angle has length 1.\n\nSince the side opposite the 60-degree angle is the longer leg of the 30-60-90 triangle, its length is $a\\sqrt{3}/2$. Substituting in the value of a (1), we get:\n\n$$\\sin 60^\\circ = \\frac{\\text{side opposite 60}^\\circ}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{1\\cdot\\sqrt{3}/2}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}.$$\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the expression (not necessary in this case)**\nWe could simplify this expression further by rationalizing the denominator, but in this case, it's not necessary.\n\n**Step 5: Put the answer in the required format**\n$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}}$",
    "To compute $\\sin 60^\\circ$, we can use the unit circle and some geometric properties.\n\nFirst, we recall that the unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1, centered at the origin of a coordinate plane. The angle $60^\\circ$ is in the first quadrant, and we want to find the sine of this angle, which is the y-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle.\n\nNow, let's consider an equilateral triangle with side length 1. In this triangle, each angle is $60^\\circ$. We draw the altitude of the triangle from one vertex to the opposite side. The altitude intersects the opposite side at its midpoint, creating a 30-60-90 triangle.\n\nThe properties of a 30-60-90 triangle are:\n\n* The ratio of the sides is 1:\u221a3:2, where the side opposite the 30\u00b0 angle is 1, the side opposite the 60\u00b0 angle is \u221a3, and the hypotenuse is 2.\n* The side opposite the 60\u00b0 angle, which is the altitude in this case, is \u221a3.\n\nSince the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse, we can conclude that:\n\n$$\\sin 60^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\n\nThis is a known trigonometric value, which can be recalled for future use.\n\nTherefore, \n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$"

  "critique": "The best solution is 2. \n\nSolution 2 is more efficient and direct in its approach to finding the value of $\\sin 60^\\circ$. It uses the properties of an equilateral triangle and the unit circle to derive the value, whereas Solution 1 uses a 30-60-90 triangle and involves more steps. Solution 2 is also more intuitive and easier to understand, especially for those familiar with the unit circle and the properties of equilateral triangles.",
