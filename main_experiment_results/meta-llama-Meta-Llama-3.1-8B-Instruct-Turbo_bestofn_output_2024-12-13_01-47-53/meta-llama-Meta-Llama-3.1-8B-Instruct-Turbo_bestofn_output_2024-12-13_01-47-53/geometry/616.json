    "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to follow the triangle inequality theorem. This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nWe have two sides of lengths 5 and 6 units. The third side is $x$ units, where $x$ is an integer.\n\nWe can use the triangle inequality to set up the following inequalities:\n\n- $5 + 6 > x$ (The sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side)\n- $5 + x > 6$ (The sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side)\n- $6 + x > 5$ (The sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side)\n\nSolving the inequalities:\n\n- $11 > x$\n- $x > 1$\n- $x > -1$ (This inequality is already satisfied by the other inequalities)\n\nWe can see that the first inequality $11 > x$ is the most restrictive one. The largest possible integer value of $x$ is 10, as 11 is not an option since it would make one of the inequalities false.\n\nNow we can find the largest possible perimeter. The largest possible perimeter will be the sum of the three sides when $x$ is at its largest: $5 + 6 + 10 = 21$ units.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible perimeter is $\\boxed{21}$.",
    "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to apply the triangle inequality theorem. \n\nThe triangle inequality theorem states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. \n\nIn this case, the lengths of the sides are 5, 6, and x. \n\nWe have three inequalities based on the triangle inequality theorem:\n1. 5 + 6 > x (11 > x)\n2. 5 + x > 6 (x > 1)\n3. 6 + x > 5 (x > -1)\n\nSince x is an integer and given the constraints from the inequalities, the smallest possible value of x is 2 (from inequality 2).\n\nWe also know that the largest possible value of x is less than 11 (from inequality 1). \n\nSo the possible values of x are from 2 to 10. \n\nHowever, we are looking for the largest possible perimeter. \n\nThe perimeter is calculated by adding the lengths of all three sides (5 + 6 + x). \n\nTo maximize the perimeter, we need to maximize the value of x while keeping it less than 11.\n\nThe largest possible value of x is 10.\n\nNow we can calculate the largest possible perimeter:\nPerimeter = 5 + 6 + 10 = 21\n\nTherefore, the largest possible perimeter of the triangle is 21.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$",
    "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to determine the largest possible value of $x$. According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nFor the given sides of length 5 and 6, we have the following inequalities:\n\n1. $5 + 6 > x$\n2. $5 + x > 6$\n3. $6 + x > 5$\n\nSimplifying the inequalities:\n\n1. $11 > x$\n2. $x > 1$\n3. $x > -1$\n\nThe first inequality ($11 > x$) gives us an upper limit for $x$, which is 10. The second inequality ($x > 1$) gives us a lower limit for $x$, which is 2.\n\nCombining the inequalities, we have $2 \\leq x \\leq 10$. Since $x$ is an integer, the possible values of $x$ are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\n\nTo find the largest possible perimeter, we need to find the corresponding value of $x$ that gives the maximum value of the sum of the lengths of the three sides. The sum of the lengths of the three sides is given by $5 + 6 + x$.\n\nThe perimeter is maximized when $x$ is maximized within the range $2 \\leq x \\leq 10$. Therefore, the largest possible value of the perimeter is given by:\n\nPerimeter = 5 + 6 + 10\n= 21\n\nSo, the largest possible perimeter of the triangle is $\\boxed{21}$."

  "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",
