    "To solve this, we need to break it down into smaller steps.\n\nStep 1: Find the area of the square $BDEF$. Since it has sides of length $3$ ($AB + BC + 1$), the area of the square $BDEF$ is $(3)^2 = 9$ square units.\n\nStep 2: Find the area of the four right triangles $\\triangle ABC$, $\\triangle CDE$, $\\triangle EFA$, and $\\triangle FAB$. Since these are all congruent and have legs of length 1, the area of each of them is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ square unit. There are four of these triangles, so the total area of the triangles is $4 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 2$ square units.\n\nStep 3: Find the area of the regular octagon. This can be done by subtracting the area of the four triangles from the area of the square. Thus, the area of the octagon is $9 - 2 = 7$ square units.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
    "To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.\n\nStep 1: Find the length of one side of the square $BDEF$. This length will be the same as the length of segment $EF$, since $BDEF$ is a square. \n\nSince triangle $FED$ is a right triangle and $DE = BE = 1$ (because $AB = BC = 1$), we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $EF$.
