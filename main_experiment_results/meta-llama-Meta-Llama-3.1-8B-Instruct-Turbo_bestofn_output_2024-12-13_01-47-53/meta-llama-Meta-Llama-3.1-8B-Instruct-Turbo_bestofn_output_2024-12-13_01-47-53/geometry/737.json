    "To find the volume of the sphere, we first need to find the radius of the sphere. \n\nThe surface area of a sphere is given by the formula $A = 4\\pi r^2$. We are given that the surface area $A$ is $324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$, so we can set up the equation:\n\n$324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2$\n\nWe can divide both sides by $4\\pi$ to get:\n\n$81 = r^2$\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the radius $r$:\n\n$r = 9$\n\nSince the diameter of the sphere is twice the radius, the diameter is:\n\n$d = 2 \\times 9 = 18$\n\nThe diameter of the sphere is also the length of the diagonal of the cube that would enclose it.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a sphere is $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$. Now that we have the radius, we can substitute it into the formula to find the volume:\n\n$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\times 9^3$\n$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\times 729$\n$V = 972\\pi$\n\nThe volume of the sphere is $\\boxed{972\\pi\\text{ cm}^3}$.",

  "solution": "Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2.\\]  Solving for $r$ and keeping the positive value yields $r^2=81$, so $r = 9$.  Hence the volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=81\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\pi = \\boxed{972\\pi}.\\]",
