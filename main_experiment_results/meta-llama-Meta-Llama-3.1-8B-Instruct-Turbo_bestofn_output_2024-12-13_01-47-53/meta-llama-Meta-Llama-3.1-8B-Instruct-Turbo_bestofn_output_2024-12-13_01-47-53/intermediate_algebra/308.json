    "To solve this problem, we will first examine the equation $f_n(x) = x$. \n\nLet's start with the base function $f(x) = \\frac{x + 6}{x}$ and assume that there's a value of $x$ for which $f(x) = x$.\n\nIn other words, $\\frac{x + 6}{x} = x$, which can be rewritten as $x + 6 = x^2$.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, $x^2 - x - 6 = 0$, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula.\n\nThe solutions to this equation are $x_1 = 3$ and $x_2 = -2$. \n\nAs this is a condition we derived from $f(x) = x$, it makes sense that for the equation $f_n(x) = x$ to hold true for some positive integer $n$, $x$ must be equal to either $3$ or $-2$.\n\nTo find the set $S$ that we're interested in, let's consider an example with $f_2(x)$.\n\nThe problem statement also provides us with an example of how $f_3(x)$ is defined in terms of $f(x)$.\n\nHowever, looking at the initial function definition we have, \n\n\\[f_n = f \\circ f_{n - 1}\\]\nIf $f(x) = x$ then for any function in the form of $f_n(x)$ we derived, the same results for x values should follow.\n\n$f_n(x)$ will similarly express the same set of values that x must be.  \n\nIf we plug in the $x$ value $3$ or $-2$ into $f(x)$, it will still hold true that $f(x) = x$. \n\nTherefore, this means that for any $n$, for $f_n(x) = x$ and the particular instance,  we will have that either $x = 3$ or $x = -2$. Since these two values must satisfy this particular function for any recursion step, we can determine the set $S$ and that it can only consist of two numbers.\n\nTherefore, the number of elements in the set S is 2.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{2}$.",
