    "To find the slant asymptote, we need to perform long division or synthetic division of the given rational expression.\n\nThe given rational expression is $y = \\frac{2x^2 + 3x - 7}{x-3}$. You can perform the polynomial division as follows:\n\n1. Divide the leading term of the numerator ($2x^2$) by the leading term of the denominator ($x$), which gives $2x$.\n2. Multiply the denominator ($x-3$) by the quotient term obtained in step 1 ($2x$), which gives $2x^2 - 6x$.\n3. Subtract the result obtained in step 2 ($2x^2 - 6x$) from the original numerator ($2x^2 + 3x - 7$), which gives $9x - 7$.\n4. Now, divide the new numerator ($9x - 7$) by the leading term of the denominator ($x$), which gives $9$.\n\nTherefore, the result of the polynomial division is $y = 2x + 9 + \\frac{9x-7}{x-3}.$  Now as the x approaches $\\infty$ from the right, the fraction $\\frac{9x-7}{x-3}$ approaches 9.  As x approaches $\\infty$ from the left, the fraction $\\frac{9x-7}{x-3}$ approaches negative infinity. However, since 9 is a horizontal asymptote, we know $9x - 7$ is indeed 0. It is, in fact, dominated by  $9x$. \n\nThus, the slant asymptote is $y = 2x + 9$.\n\nTo find $m + b$, simply add the coefficients of $x$ and the constant term:\n$m + b = 2 + 9 = 11$\n\n$\\boxed{11}$",

  "solution": "To approach this problem, we can either use long division or synthetic division to evaluate the quotient of the given rational expression. Alternatively, we can rewrite the numerator as $2x^2 + 3x - 7$ $ = 2x^2 + 3x - 7 - 9x + 9x$ $ = 2x(x-3) + 9x - 7 - 20 + 20$ $ = 2x(x-3) + 9(x-3) + 20$.
