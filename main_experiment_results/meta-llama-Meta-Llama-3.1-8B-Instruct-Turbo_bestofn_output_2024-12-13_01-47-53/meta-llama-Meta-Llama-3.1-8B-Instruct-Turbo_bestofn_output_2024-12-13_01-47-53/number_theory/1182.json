    "To find the residue of the expression $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$, we'll calculate it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate $182\\cdot 12$. Since $182\\equiv 0 \\pmod{14}$, when we multiply $182$ by $12$, we can multiply $0$ by $12$ instead. This will make the calculation much easier.\n\n$182\\cdot 12 \\equiv 0\\cdot 12 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{14}$\n\nNow, let's calculate $15\\cdot 7$. We know $15\\equiv 1 \\pmod{14}$. So, we can rewrite this as $1\\cdot 7$. \n\n$15\\cdot 7 \\equiv 1\\cdot 7 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{14}$\n\nNow, we subtract $7$ from $0$. So, for subtraction, we will use the equation :\n\n$182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\pmod{14}$\n\nCombine like terms. \n\n$182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\pmod{14}$\n\nSince $-4 \\pmod{14}$ is equivalent to finding a positive residue within $14$, we can add $14$ to $-4$. \n\n$-4 + 14 = 10 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{14}$\n\nTherefore, the residue of the expression is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "To find the residue of the given expression, we will follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1. Multiply 182 and 12: $182\\cdot 12$\n   To simplify this expression, we don't need the actual result because we are looking for the residue mod 14 (hence, we can simplify this expression by finding the residue of 182 and 12 mod 14, then multiplying the results mod 14).\n   \n   $182\\equiv 0 \\pmod{14}$ (182 is divisible by 14)\n   $12\\equiv 12 \\pmod{14}$ (as 12 is not divisible by 14)\n   \n   So, $(182\\cdot 12)\\equiv (0\\cdot 12) \\pmod{14} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{14}$.\n\n2. Multiply 15 and 7: $15\\cdot 7$\n   Since 15 is not divisible by 14, we will simplify this expression in the same way:\n   $15\\equiv 1 \\pmod{14}$\n   $7\\equiv 7 \\pmod{14}$\n\n   So, $(15\\cdot 7)\\equiv (1\\cdot 7) \\pmod{14} \\equiv 7  \\pmod{14}$.\n\n3. Add the results and 3: $0 - 7 + 3$\n   Now, let's calculate this:\n   $0 - 7 = -7 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{14}$ (as -7 is congruent to 7 mod 14).\n   $7 + 3 = 10$.\n\n4. The residue of $10 \\pmod{14}$ is 10.\n\nSo, the final residue is $\\boxed{10}$."

  "solution": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7.
