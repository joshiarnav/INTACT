    "To solve the congruence $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Reduce $1234 \\pmod{7}$: \nWe calculate $1234 \\pmod{7}$ by dividing $1234$ by $7$ and finding the remainder. \n$1234 \\div 7 = 176$ with a remainder of $2$.\nSo, $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n2. Reduce $17 \\pmod{7}$: \nNext, we calculate $17 \\pmod{7}$ by dividing $17$ by $7$ and finding the remainder.\n$17 \\div 7 = 2$ with a remainder of $3$.\nSo, $17 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n3. Rewrite the congruence: \nUsing the results from steps 1 and 2, we rewrite the original congruence:\n$3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n4. Find the modular inverse of $3 \\pmod{7}$:\nWe need to find an integer $x$ such that $3x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\nTo do this, we can check the integers from $1$ to $6$ (the possible values of $x \\pmod{7}$) to see which one satisfies the equation.\nAfter checking, we find that $5$ satisfies the equation:\n$3 \\times 5 = 15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\nSo, the modular inverse of $3 \\pmod{7}$ is $5$.\n\n5. Multiply both sides by the modular inverse:\nNow we multiply both sides of the congruence by $5$:\n$5 \\times 3n \\equiv 5 \\times 2 \\pmod{7}$.\nThis simplifies to:\n$15n \\equiv 10 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n6. Simplify the equation:\nSince $15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$ and $10 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$, the equation simplifies to:\n$n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n7. Find the smallest positive integer solution:\nThe smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the equation is given by:\n$n = 3$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$ is $\\boxed{3}$."

  "solution": "First, we simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$ to $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, we have $$17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$This means that $17n$ can be written in the form $7a+2$, where $a$ is an integer. So we have $17n=7a+2$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\\frac{7a+2}{17}=n$ is an integer. By trying values for $a$, we find that the smallest integer $a$ which satisfies the equation is $7$. Therefore, the least value for $n$ is $\\frac{51}{17}=\\boxed{3}$.",
