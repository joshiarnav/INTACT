    "Let the three integers be $a$, $b$, and $c$. \n\nWhen $a$ is divided by 24, the remainder is 10. This means $a = 24k + 10$ for some integer $k$.\nWhen $b$ is divided by 24, the remainder is 4. This means $b = 24l + 4$ for some integer $l$.\nWhen $c$ is divided by 24, the remainder is 12. This means $c = 24m + 12$ for some integer $m$.\n\nWe can find the sum of the three integers as $a + b + c = (24k + 10) + (24l + 4) + (24m + 12)$.\n\nCombining like terms, we get $a + b + c = 24k + 24l + 24m + 26$.\n\nFactoring out the 24, we get $a + b + c = 24(k + l + m) + 26$.\n\nNow, $24(k + l + m)$ is a multiple of 24, so it will leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 24. \n\nSo, when $a + b + c$ is divided by 24, the remainder is the remainder when 26 is divided by 24. \n\nTo find this, we can subtract 24 from 26, which is 2. This is the remainder.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24 is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "To find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24, let's first denote the three integers as $a$, $b$, and $c$, such that $a = 24p + 10$, $b = 24q + 4$, and $c = 24r + 12$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are some integers.\n\nNow, let's add the three integers to get the sum: \n\n$(a + b + c) = (24p + 10) + (24q + 4) + (24r + 12) = 24p + 24q + 24r + 26$\n\nNotice that $24p$, $24q$, and $24r$ are all multiples of 24, so they can be removed from the sum without changing the remainder.\n\nHence, the sum of the three integers can be written as: \n\n$(24p + 24q + 24r) + 26 = 24( p + q + r) + 26$\n\nIn this expression, $p + q + r$ can be any integer, but we are only interested in the remainder when the sum is divided by 24.\n\nThe remainder we are looking for is the remainder of 26 when divided by 24.\n\nUsing the concept of congruence, we can write this as:\n\n$26 \\equiv 2 \\mod 24$\n\nThis means that the remainder is $2$, so the sum of the three integers has a remainder of $2$ when divided by $24$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. When a number is divided by another number and leaves a remainder, it can be represented as:\n\nNumber = (Quotient * Divisor) + Remainder\n\nHere, we are given three numbers, and the remainders they leave when divided by 24 are 10, 4, and 12, respectively. We can represent these numbers as:\n\nNumber 1 = (Quotient 1 * 24) + 10\nNumber 2 = (Quotient 2 * 24) + 4\nNumber 3 = (Quotient 3 * 24) + 12\n\nNow, we are asked to find the remainder when the sum of the three numbers is divided by 24. The sum of the three numbers can be represented as:\n\nNumber 1 + Number 2 + Number 3 \n= (Quotient 1 * 24) + 10 + (Quotient 2 * 24) + 4 + (Quotient 3 * 24) + 12\n= (24 * (Quotient 1 + Quotient 2 + Quotient 3)) + (10 + 4 + 12)\n= (24 * (Quotient 1 + Quotient 2 + Quotient 3)) + 26\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 26 is divided by 24. We can do this by subtracting 24 from 26 (since 24 goes into 26 once), and then keep the remainder. \n\n26 - 24 = 2\n\nSince the remainder is always non-negative, the remainder when the sum of the three numbers is divided by 24 is 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{2}$."

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, we need to evaluate each solution based on its clarity, conciseness, and correctness.\n\nSolution 1 is a good attempt, but it could be more concise. It uses a lot of variables and equations, which makes it harder to follow.\n\nSolution 2 is similar to Solution 1, but it uses the concept of congruence, which is a good approach. However, it still uses a lot of variables and equations.\n\nSolution 3 is the most concise and clear solution. It uses a simple and straightforward approach to solve the problem. It also avoids using unnecessary variables and equations.\n\nBased on the evaluation, I would say that Solution 3 is the best solution. Therefore, the index number of the best solution is 3.",
  "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 10\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 12\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 10+4+12 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $24$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
