    "To solve the given expression, we'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: \n   (6 + 1 - 4) \n   = 6 + 1 \n   = 7 \n   - 4 \n   = 3\n\n   So the expression is now: (21 \\div 3) * 5\n\n2. Evaluate the division:\n   21 / 3 \n   = 7\n\n   Now the expression is: 7 * 5\n\n3. Evaluate the multiplication:\n   7 * 5 \n   = 35\n\nSo the final answer is $\\boxed{35}$.",
    "To evaluate the expression, we'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1.
