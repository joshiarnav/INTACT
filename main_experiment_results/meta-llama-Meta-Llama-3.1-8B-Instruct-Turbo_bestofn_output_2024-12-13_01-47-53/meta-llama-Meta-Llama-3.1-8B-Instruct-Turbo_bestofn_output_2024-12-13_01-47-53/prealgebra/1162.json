  "problem": "Chloe wants to buy a hoodie that costs $\\$32.75$. She empties her wallet and finds she only has three $\\$10$ bills, eight quarters, and a pile of dimes. What is the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie?",

    "To find the minimum number of dimes that Chloe must have, let's first determine the remaining cost that needs to be covered after using the available $\\$10$ bills.\n\nShe has three $10 bills, which equals $3 \\times 10 = 30$ dollars. So, after using the $10 bills, she has $32.75 - 30 = 2.75$ dollars left to cover.\n\nSince each quarter is worth 0.25 dollars, eight quarters will be worth $8 \\times 0.25 = 2$ dollars. This leaves her with $2.75 - 2 = 0.75$ dollars remaining to cover.\n\nSince each dime is worth 0.10 dollars, to find the minimum number of dimes needed to cover 0.75 dollars, we'll divide 0.75 by 0.10.\n\n0.75 / 0.10 = 7.5\n\nSince she can't have a fraction of a dime, she'll need 8 dimes (the smallest whole number greater than 7.5).\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "To find the minimum number of dimes Chloe needs, let's first calculate the total amount she already has from the three $\\$10$ bills and eight quarters. \n\nThree $\\$10$ bills amount to $3 \\cdot \\$10 = \\$30$.\n\nEight quarters amount to $8 \\cdot \\$0.25 = \\$2$.\n\nThe total amount from the three $\\$10$ bills and eight quarters is $\\$30 + \\$2 = \\$32$.\n\nSince Chloe has a total of $\\$32$ from the three $\\$10$ bills and eight quarters, and the hoodie costs $\\$32.75$, she still needs $\\$0.75$ to pay for the hoodie with the remaining money (which is her pile of dimes).\n\nSince each dime is worth $\\$0.10$, and she needs to pay $\\$0.75$ with her pile of dimes, she will need to have at least $\\$0.75 \\div \\$0.10 = 7.5$ dimes.\n\nSince you cannot have half a dime, we will round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the minimum number of dimes Chloe needs is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "To find the minimum number of dimes Chloe needs, let's first calculate how much money she has without considering the dimes. \n\nShe has three $\\$10$ bills, which is a total of $3 \\cdot 10 = \\$30$. \nShe has eight quarters, each quarter is worth $\\$0.25$, so the total value of the quarters is $8 \\cdot 0.25 = \\$2$.\nTherefore, without the dimes, Chloe has a total of $\\$30 + \\$2 = \\$32$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the remaining amount needed to buy the hoodie ($\\$32.75$ - $\\$32$ = $\\$0.75$). Since we need to cover this remaining amount using dimes, each dime will contribute $\\$0.10$ to the total.\n\nTo find the minimum number of dimes needed, we'll divide the remaining amount ($\\$0.75$) by the value of each dime ($\\$0.10$).\n\nMinimum number of dimes = $\\frac{\\$0.75}{\\$0.10}$ = $7.5$\n\nSince we can't have half a dime, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to meet the remaining amount.

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and yield the same result of 8 dimes. \n\nHowever, we need to determine which solution is the \"best\" solution. Based on the clarity and conciseness of the solutions, Solution 2 appears to be the best solution. It clearly explains the steps and calculations involved in finding the minimum number of dimes needed.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is 2.",
