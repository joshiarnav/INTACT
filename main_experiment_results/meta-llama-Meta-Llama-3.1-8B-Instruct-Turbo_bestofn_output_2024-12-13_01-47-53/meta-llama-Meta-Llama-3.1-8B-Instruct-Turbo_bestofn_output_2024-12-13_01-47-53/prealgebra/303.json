    "To solve the problem, we need to find the decimal equivalents of the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, and then add them.\n\nFirst, we know that $\\frac{1}{3}$ can be written as $0.\\overline{3}$.\n\nNext, we need to find the decimal equivalent of $\\frac{1}{7}$. To do this, we can use long division:\n\n$0.\\overline{142857}$\n\nWe can see that the decimal equivalent of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$.\n\nNow, we add the two decimal equivalents:\n\n$0.\\overline{3} + 0.\\overline{142857}$\n\nSince the two decimals have the same periodicity (they both repeat in blocks of 6), we can add their first 6 digits:\n\n$0.\\overline{472857}$\n\nThe next step is to determine the 20th digit after the decimal point in the sum.\n\nSince the decimal is periodic with a period of 6, we can divide 20 by 6:\n\n$20 \\div 6 = 3$ remainder $2$\n\nThe remainder tells us that the 20th digit is in the third repetition, and it is the second digit of the periodic block, which is $7$.\n\nTherefore, the 20th digit after the decimal point of the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "To find the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, we first need to convert these fractions into decimal form.\n\n$\\frac{1}{7}$ can be converted to a decimal by dividing 1 by 7, which is 0.$\\overline{142857}$.\n\n$\\frac{1}{3}$ can be converted to a decimal by dividing 1 by 3, which is 0.$\\overline{3}$.\n\nThe sum of these two decimals would be 0.$\\overline{142857}$ + 0.$\\overline{3}$.\n\nTo add these two repeating decimals, we can multiply the first decimal by a power of 10 to shift the repeating part away from the decimal point, and then we can subtract the second decimal from it. However, we can also add them directly.\n\nGiven that the repeating part of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is 6 digits, we can ignore the repeating part of $\\frac{1}{3}$ which has a repeating part of only 1 digit.\n\nAdding 0.$\\overline{142857}$ and 0.$\\overline{3}$ directly, we can see that every 6th digit after the decimal point in 0.$\\overline{142857}$ will be a 5. Starting from the very first digit after the decimal point, we can predict the sum by looking at the pattern.\n\nFor example, for the 7th digit after the decimal point, we will be adding 2 (from the second digit in 0.$\\overline{142857}$ and the first digit in 0.3) + 4 + 2 + 8 + 5 + 7 = 28, and then we carry-over the 2 from 28.\n\nNow we need to find the sum's 20th digit after the decimal point. Since the fraction $\\frac{1}{7}$\u2019s repeating decimal is $\\overline{142857}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $\\overline{3}$, a combination of 6-digit + 1-digit decimals, we should be able to predict the 20th digit by looking at the 4th repeated 6-digit block and ensuring it doesn\u2019t interfere with the subsequent 1-digit decimal (0.3). We simply ignore the decimal 0.3 and just focus on the 6-digit block in 0.$\\overline{142857}$.\n\nThe 4th repeated block is: 142857. We simply take the 1st digit (or 7 in 142857) from the first digit of the repeating block after the decimal point and we add it to the next digit (or 4) from the repeating block after the decimal point.\n\nThe same process should be repeated for every subsequent digit to find the correct number.\n\nIn general, for the n-th digit (where n is a multiple of 6 plus 4 to 19, as you are adding one 6-digit block with n-th digit), we take digit (n-4) % 6 of the repeating decimal 0.$\\overline{142857}$, ignoring 0.$\\overline{3}$.\n\nNow let\u2019s solve the 20th digit. The 20th digit is equivalent to the 4th repeated 6-digit decimal (the 4th block) in 0.$\\overline{142857}$.\n\n20 mod 6 = 2.\n\n4th repeated block digit is digit 4 in the 6-digit decimal 142857.

  "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$, and that of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $0.\\overline{3}$. The first has a repeating block of 6 digits and the second has a repeating block of 1 digit, so we believe the repeating block of the sum will have 6 digits and try adding the first 6 digits of each decimal representation.  $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}& & &. &1 & 4 & \\stackrel{1}{2} & 8 & \\stackrel{1}{5} & 7\\\\& +& &. &3 &3 & 3 & 3& 3 & 3\\\\ \\cline{1-9} & & & .& 4 &7 & 6 & 1 & 9 & 0\\\\ \\end{array} $$ Notice that continuing the addition past the first six digits will result in repeating blocks of the same six digits ($.142857+.333333=.476190$), so the decimal representation of the sum is $0.\\overline{476190}$. Since 20 divided by 6 has a remainder of 2, the 20th digit following the decimal point is the same as the second digit following the decimal point, which is $\\boxed{7}$.",
