    "To find the area of $S'$, we can use the fact that the area of a region scales by a factor equal to the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix applied to it. \n\nFirst, we need to find the determinant of the given matrix. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ is given by the formula $ad - bc$.\n\nFor our matrix, we have $a = 2$, $b = -1$, $c = 7$, and $d = 2$. Therefore, the determinant is $(2)(2) - (-1)(7) = 4 + 7 = 11$.\n\nThe area of $S'$ is then the area of $S$ scaled by the absolute value of the determinant. Since the area of $S$ is 4, the area of $S'$ is $|11| \\times 4 = 44$. \n\nTherefore, the area of $S'$ is $\\boxed{44}$.",
