    "To find the image of $2i$ under the dilation with center $-1 + 4i$ and scale factor $-2$, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the vector from the center to the preimage**: The vector from the center $-1 + 4i$ to the preimage $2i$ is given by:\n   \\[ \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n   This is because the center is at $(-1, 4)$ and the preimage is at $(0, 2)$ (since $2i$ in complex form is $(0, 2)$).\n\n2. **Dilate this vector with the given scale factor**: We multiply the vector by the scale factor $-2$:\n   \\[ -2 \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ 8 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\n3. **Translate the result back to find the image**: We add the dilated vector to the center:\n   \\[ (-1 + 4i) + \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ 8 \\end{pmatrix} = -1 + 4i - 4 + 8i \\]\n   \\[ = (-1 - 4) + (4 + 8)i \\]\n   \\[ = -5 + 12i \\]\n\nSo, the image of $2i$ under the dilation is $\\boxed{-5 + 12i}.$",

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, let's examine each solution for accuracy and clarity.\n\nSolution 1 is the most detailed and provides a clear explanation of the process. It correctly identifies the vector from the center to the preimage, dilates the vector with the given scale factor, and then translates the result back to find the image. The final answer is also correctly calculated.\n\nSolution 2 has some inaccuracies. In Step 1, the vector from the center of dilation to the point $2i$ is incorrectly calculated. It should be $1 - 2i$ but the $i$ is misplaced. In Step 2, the multiplication of the vector by the scale factor is correct. However, in Step 3, the addition of the scaled vector to the center of dilation is also incorrect. The correct calculation should be $(-1 + 4i) + (-2 + 4i) = -3 + 8i$, but the solution incorrectly states the result as $-3 + 8i$ without showing the intermediate steps.\n\nSolution 3 is similar to Solution 2. The vector from the center of dilation to the point $2i$ is correctly calculated as $1 - 2i$, but the multiplication of the vector by the scale factor is not explicitly shown. The addition of the scaled vector to the center of dilation is also not clearly explained.\n\nBased on the analysis, Solution 1 is the most accurate and clear. Therefore, the best solution is Solution 1.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
