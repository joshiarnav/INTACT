    "To find the value of $x$ such that the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$ are orthogonal, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. The two vectors will be orthogonal if their dot product is zero.\n2. The dot product of two vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\end{pmatrix}$ is given by the equation $a_1b_1 + a_2b_2$.\n3. Substituting the components of our vectors, we get the equation $2x + 5(-3) = 0$.\n\nNow we simplify the equation to solve for x:\n\n$2x -15 = 0$\n\nTo isolate x, we add 15 to both sides of the equation:\n\n$2x = 15$\n\nThen we divide both sides by 2:\n\n$x = \\frac{15}{2}$\n\nSo, the value of x that makes the two vectors orthogonal is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{15}{2}}$",
