    "To find the first term of the geometric sequence, let's define the sequence as:\n\na1, a1*r, a1*r^2, a1*r^3, ...\n\nwhere 'a1' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio.\n\nGiven that the third term (a1*r^2) is 12 and the fourth term (a1*r^3) is 16, we can set up two equations:\n\na1*r^2 = 12 ... (1)\na1*r^3 = 16 ... (2)\n\nWe can divide equation (2) by equation (1) to eliminate 'a1':\n\n(a1*r^3) / (a1*r^2) = 16 / 12\nr = 16/12\nr = 4/3\n\nNow that we have the common ratio, we can substitute 'r' into one of the original equations to find 'a1'. Let's use equation (1):\n\na1*(4/3)^2 = 12\na1*(16/9) = 12\na1 = 12 * (9/16)\na1 = 81/16\n\nTherefore, the first term of the geometric sequence is $\\boxed{81/16}$.",
    "To find the first term of the sequence, we can use the properties of geometric sequences. \n\nA geometric sequence is defined as follows: \n- Each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio (r).\n- If the first term is 'a', the sequence will be: a, ar, ar\u00b2, ar\u00b3, ...\n\nGiven that the third term is 12, we can represent it as ar\u00b2 = 12.\nThe fourth term is 16, so we can represent it as ar\u00b3 = 16.\n\nNow, we can divide the two equations to solve for 'r':\n( ar\u00b3 ) / ( ar\u00b2 ) = 16 / 12\nar / a = 4/3 (because a cancels out)\nr = 4/3\n\nNow that we have the common ratio (r), we can find the first term ('a') using the equation ar\u00b2 = 12. Since we now have 'r', we can substitute it in and solve for 'a':\n\nar\u00b2 = 12\na(4/3)\u00b2 = 12\na(16/9) = 12\na = 12 * (9/16)\na = 108/16\na = 27/4\n\nSo, the first term of the sequence is 27/4.\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{27/4}$",
    "To find the first term of the geometric sequence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Recall the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence: $a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{(n-1)}$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the term number.\n\n2. We are given the third and fourth terms of the sequence as 12 and 16, respectively. We can write these as $a_3 = 12$ and $a_4 = 16$.\n\n3. To find the common ratio $r$, we can use the ratio of the fourth term to the third term. We have $\\frac{a_4}{a_3} = \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\n4. Since the fourth term is the third term multiplied by the common ratio, we can equate $\\frac{4}{3}$ to $r$. Therefore, $r = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\n5. We can now use one of the given terms to find the first term. We will use the third term, which is $a_3 = a_1 \\cdot r^{(3-1)} = 12$.\n\n6. Substituting $r = \\frac{4}{3}$ into the equation above, we get $12 = a_1 \\cdot (\\frac{4}{3})^2$.\n\n7. Evaluating $(\\frac{4}{3})^2$, we get $\\frac{16}{9}$. Now, the equation becomes $12 = a_1 \\cdot \\frac{16}{9}$.\n\n8. To find $a_1$, we can divide both sides of the equation by $\\frac{16}{9}$. We get $a_1 = \\frac{12}{\\frac{16}{9}}$.\n\n9. To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. Therefore, $a_1 = 12 \\cdot \\frac{9}{16}$.\n\n10. Evaluating the expression, we get $a_1 = \\frac{108}{16}$.\n\n11. Simplifying the fraction, we get $a_1 = \\frac{27}{4}$.\n\nSo, the first term of the geometric sequence is $\\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$."

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 2, as it is the most concise and straightforward approach to solving the problem. \n\nHowever, if we were to evaluate the solutions based on their accuracy, all three solutions yield the same answer, which is 27/4. Therefore, the index of the best solution is actually 2 or 3, as they are mathematically equivalent. \n\nBut if we were to strictly follow the instructions, we would have to choose one of them, and in this case, I would recommend Solution 3, as it is also very clear and easy to follow. \n\nSo, the index of the best solution is 3.",
  "solution": "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence. Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$. Solving, we have $a\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",
