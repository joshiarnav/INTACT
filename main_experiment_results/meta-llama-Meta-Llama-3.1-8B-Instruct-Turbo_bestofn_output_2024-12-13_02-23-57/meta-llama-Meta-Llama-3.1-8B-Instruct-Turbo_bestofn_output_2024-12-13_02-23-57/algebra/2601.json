    "To find the value of c, we need to consider the function f(x) = 3x^2 + x. The parabola opens upwards since the coefficient of x^2 is positive.\n\nWe are given that the inequality x(3x + 1) < c holds if and only if x \u2208 (-7/3, 2). \n\nSince the function is a parabola that opens upwards, the largest value of the function on the interval (-7/3, 2) will occur at the endpoints.\n\nLet's evaluate the function at the endpoints x = -7/3 and x = 2.\n\nAt x = -7/3, we have f(-7/3) = 3(-7/3)^2 + (-7/3) = 3(49/9) - 7/3 = 49/3 - 7/3 = 42/3 = 14.\n\nAt x = 2, we have f(2) = 3(2)^2 + 2 = 3(4) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nWe notice that both evaluations yield the same function value. Since the function values at both endpoints are the same, the largest value on the interval (-7/3, 2) is indeed 14.\n\nThus, the value of c is the function value at the endpoints, which is 14.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$",
    "To find the value of $c$, we can start by understanding the given inequality and its relation to the given interval. \n\nThe inequality $x\\cdot(3x+1)<c$ can be rewritten as $3x^2+x<c$. \n\nSince this inequality is satisfied if and only when $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$, we know that the quadratic $3x^2+x$ must be less than $c$ for $x$ in this interval.\n\nNow, let's consider the boundary points of the interval: $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x=2$.\n\nPlugging $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ into the quadratic, we get:\n\n$$3\\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right)^2+\\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right)=\\frac{49}{3}-\\frac{7}{3}=\\frac{42}{3}=14.$$\n\nSimilarly, plugging $x=2$ into the quadratic, we get:\n\n$$3(2)^2+2=12+2=14.$$\n\nBoth boundary values yield the same result. This indicates that the value of the inequality $3x^2+x<c$ is less than $c$ at the boundary points, meaning that the inequality is satisfied in the interval $\\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$.\n\nBecause the value $14$ is obtained at the endpoints, the exact value of $c$ is the result of the quadratic equation, which is when $x$ is $\\pm \\infty$. Due to the parabola $3x^2+x$ opening upward, its quadratic equation is of the form $y=3x^2+x$. Since all parabolas have a point of inflection $b^2/4a$ on the horizontal axis, we have that this parabola is horizontal at the point $(b^2/4a, k)$, where $k = 0$. Since the value $14$ was fixed at our endpoints, the parabola with equation $(y=k)$ is representative of the parabola of $(3,1)$. If $y$ is equal to $14$, then if $(3,1)$ was plugged in and it was already equal to $(3,14)$, all of our values for the parabola $(3,1)$ will be true. So if $(14,k)$ was plugged into $(3k)$, we would get $(3(14))=42$, and we would have that the value for k was $\\boxed{\\frac{3*14}{3}}$, but this isn't a proper quadratic equation. If we plug in $(0,14)$, we get that $14k$ is equal to $k$ plus $14$. Therefore, subtracting $k$ from both sides, we get that $k(14-1)$ is equal to $14$. We simplify the product to $13k$, and $\\frac{14}{13}$, which is equal to $\\frac{k}{13}$. Therefore, k is equal to $\\frac{14*13}{13}$ or $\\boxed{14}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$"
