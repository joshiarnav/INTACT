    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nSince the parabola has a vertex at $(-4,0)$, we know that its equation can be written in the form $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex. In this case, $h = -4$ and $k = 0$. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\n$$y = a(x + 4)^2$$\n\nNow, we know that the parabola passes through the point $(1, -75)$. We can plug this point into the equation to solve for $a$:\n\n$$-75 = a(1 + 4)^2$$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n$$-75 = a(5)^2$$\n$$-75 = 25a$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $a$:\n\n$$a = \\frac{-75}{25}$$\n$$a = -3$$\n\nSo, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{-3}$.",

  "solution": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic must be of the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$.  The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, which gives us the equation $-75 = 25a$.  Hence, $a = -75/25 = \\boxed{-3}$.",
