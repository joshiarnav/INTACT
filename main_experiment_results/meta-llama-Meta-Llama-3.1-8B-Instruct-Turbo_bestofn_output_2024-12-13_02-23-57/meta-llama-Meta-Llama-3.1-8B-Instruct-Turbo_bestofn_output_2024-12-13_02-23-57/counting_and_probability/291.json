    "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $7!$ and $(5!)^2$, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Calculate $7!$ and $(5!)^2$\n\n- $7! = 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 5040$\n- $(5!)^2 = (5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1)^2 = 120^2 = 14400$\n\nStep 2: Find the prime factorizations of $7!$ and $(5!)^2$\n\n- To find the prime factorization of $7!$, we need to break it down:\n  $7! = 5040 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$\n- For $(5!)^2$, we know that $5! = 120 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$.
