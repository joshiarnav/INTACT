    "To find the number of ways Karl can select four crayons, we need to use combinations (since the order doesn't matter). Combinations are calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nWhere:\n- n is the total number of items (in this case, 12 crayons),\n- k is the number of items to be chosen (in this case, 4 crayons),\n- ! denotes the factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number (e.g. 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120).\n\nLet's substitute the values:\n\nn = 12 (total number of crayons)\nk = 4 (number of crayons to be chosen)\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4!(12-4)!)\n           = 12! / (4!8!)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n12! = 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 479,001,600\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40,320\n\nNow, let's substitute these values back into the equation:\n\nC(12, 4) = 479,001,600 / (24 * 40,320)\n              = 479,001,600 / 967,680\n              = 495\n\nTherefore, the number of ways Karl can select four crayons is:\n\n$\\boxed{495}$",
    "This problem can be solved using combinations. \n\n1. First, we have 12 different-colored crayons in a box and we need to select 4 of them. \n2. The order in which we draw them out does not matter, which means we are looking for the number of combinations.\n3. The formula for combinations is: C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n   - n is the total number of items (12 crayons in this case)\n   - r is the number of items we want to select (4 crayons in this case)\n4. We can plug these values into the formula:\n   - C(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * (12-4)!)\n   - C(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * 8!)\n5. Now we can simplify the expression:\n   - 12! = 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n   - 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n   - 8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n6. We can cancel out the 8! in the numerator and the denominator, as well as the 4! in the numerator and the denominator:\n   - C(12, 4) = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n   - C(12, 4) = (11880) / (24)\n   - C(12, 4) = 495\n\nSo the number of ways Karl can select four crayons if the order in which he draws them out does not matter is: $\\boxed{495}$",
    "To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of combinations. Since the order in which Karl selects the crayons doesn't matter, we want to find the number of ways to choose 4 crayons out of 12.\n\nStep 1: We need to choose 4 crayons out of 12, so we'll use the combination formula. The formula for combinations is given by:\n\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of items (12 crayons in this case)\n- r is the number of items to be chosen (4 crayons in this case)\n- ! denotes the factorial operation (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nStep 2: Now, we'll plug in the values into the formula:\n\nn = 12\nr = 4\n\nSubstituting these values, we get:\n\n12C4 = 12! / (4! * (12-4)!)\n\nStep 3: Simplifying the expression, we have:\n\n12C4 = 12! / (4! * 8!)\n\nStep 4: Calculating the factorials, we get:\n\n12! = 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n= 479,001,600\n\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n= 24\n\n8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n= 40,320\n\nStep 5: Plugging in these values into the expression, we get:\n\n12C4 = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nStep 6: Simplifying the expression, we get:\n\n12C4 = (118,808) / (24)\n= 4950\n\nSo, there are 4950 ways for Karl to select four crayons if the order in which he draws them out does not matter.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{4950}$."

  "critique": "The correct solution is Solution 1 and Solution 2, which both yield the answer $\\boxed{495}$. However, Solution 3 yields a different answer, $\\boxed{4950}$, which is incorrect.\n\nThe best solution is Solution 1 and Solution 2, so the index number is 1 or 2. Since both are correct, I will return 1 as the index number. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is 1.",
  "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",
