    "To find the largest $2$-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$, let's first understand what ${200\\choose 100}$ means.\n\nThe expression ${200\\choose 100}$ is read as \"200 choose 100.\" It represents the number of ways to choose 100 items from a set of 200 items, disregarding the order.\n\n${200\\choose 100}$ can be computed using the formula:\n\n${n\\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$\n\nUsing this formula, we have\n\n${200\\choose 100} = \\frac{200!}{100!100!}$\n\nThis is a very large number and finding its exact value might be difficult. However, we can simplify it by writing it in terms of prime factors.\n\nNote that all primes in the prime factorization of $n = {200\\choose 100}$ come from the prime factorization of $200!$ since $100!100!$ does not contain any primes above $100$.\n\nUsing the formula, we have\n\n${200\\choose 100} = \\frac{200!}{100!100!} = \\frac{(1)(2)\\dots(199)(200)}{(1)(2)\\dots(100)(100)(100)\\dots(100)}$\n\nNow, we can write $200!$ as the product of its prime factors.\n\n$200! = 2^{100}3^{50}5^{26}7^{18}11^{14}13^{12}...$\n\nUsing this, we have\n\n${200\\choose 100} = \\frac{2^{100}3^{50}5^{26}7^{18}11^{14}13^{12}...}{(100!)^2}.$\n\nNow, to simplify the expression further, we note that the prime factors below $100$ appear to the power of at least $50$ inside $100!$ because there are $100$ positive integers that are divisible by the prime. Similarly, the prime factors from $101$ to $200$ appear as multiples of $100!$ and hence have powers of more than $50$ due to the more occurrences of their prime due to the more the value.\n\nThe largest $2$-digit prime is 97. \n\nTo solve this problem, let's focus on the properties of the expression:\n\n${200\\choose 100} = \\frac{200!}{100!100!} = \\frac{(1)(2)\\dots(199)(200)}{(1)(2)\\dots(100)(100)(100)\\dots(100)}$\n\nSince all primes in the prime factorization of $n = {200\\choose 100}$ come from the prime factorization of $200!$, and since each prime factor below 100 appears at least 50 times due to the more occurrences of the value and since 97 is a prime number and $100!$ does not have any more $97$ more the $50$ which are the multiple of $97$ that divide the multiple and prime $97$, since there are $101$ such multiples, including all the prime factors between 100 and 200.\n\nHence the  prime $97$ does not divide the the $(100!)^2$ but $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ $7,$ $11,$ $13,$ $17,$ $19,$ $23,$ $29,$ $31,$ $37,$ $41,$ $43,$ $47$ all of these prime factors of number $100!$. due to the more occurrences the power of the each of $100!$ the due to the more occurrences does the $(100!)^2$.\n\n\nTherefore,  the largest  2-digit prime that divides $n = {200\\choose 100}$ is $\\boxed{97}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we first need to calculate or understand the structure of the binomial coefficient ${200\\choose 100}$. \n\nWe can express ${200\\choose 100}$ as $\\frac{200!}{100!100!}$.\n\nNow, let's break it down to find its prime factors. For this, we'll find the prime factors of larger numbers within the factorials.\n\nWe'll express $200!$ as the product of its prime factors raised to certain powers: \n\n$2^{199}$ \n$3^{96}$ \n$5^{49}$ \n$7^{33}$ \n$11^{22}$ \n$13^{17}$ \n$17^{12}$ \n$19^{9}$ \n$23^{7}$ \n$29^{6}$ \n$31^{5}$ \n$37^{4}$ \n$41^{3}$ \n$43^{3}$\n$47^{3}$\n $53^{3}$\n $59^{3}$\n $61^{3}$\n $67^{3}$\n $71^{3}$\n $73^{3}$\n $79^{3}$\n $83^{3}$\n $89^{3}$\n $97^{3}$\n\nNow, for ${100\\choose 100}$, we'll get $1$ from the denominator when we divide it, because it is $100!$ divided by itself. Therefore, this doesn't have an impact on the prime factors.\n\nSimilarly, for the second $100!$, which was raised to the power of $2$ (100 choose 100), the effect would also be to get 1 when we divide it, which doesn't have any importance to our case.\n\nNow we need to simplify the given fraction by canceling out common factors.\n\nWhen we divide $200!$ by $100! \\times 100!,$ the larger ones (from the first expression; that is $199$; $96$, $49$, $33$, $22$, etc. of $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, $11$, etc. larger than one;  which are bigger than the one's of the two $100!$) cancel out but the lower-order ones don't.\n\nTo get our answer, we need to calculate the lower-order powers of $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, $11$, etc., that can divide the expression. \n\nFor $2$: since $100 <2^{99}$ and $2^{199}$, the power would be $99$.\nFor $3$: $100 < 3^{66} < 3^{96}$, so the power will be $66$.\nFor $5$: The same can be said about $5^{94}$ since it lies between $100$ and $5^{99}.$ Therefore the power of $5$ will be $94$.\nFor $7$: The power of $7$ would be $33$ since $7^{33}$ lies between $100$ and $7^{94}$.\nFor $11$: There are $9$ factors of 11 (because there are nine multiple of 11 between $0$ and $94$ since one 11 multiplied to the multiple gives us the 100 limit, without reaching 11 itself)\nFor $13$: There are $7$ factors of $13$ which is a constant like ones in 9 previous cases. \nFor primes $17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97$: since $16,20,24,30,32,38,42,44,48,54,60,68,72,74,80,84,88,92,96$ can't be divided with these prime numbers and if  we add 1 to every larger number within that range: $17,18,21,23,33,39,41,43,49,55,61,69,73,75,81,85,89,93,97$ and can be exactly divided: there will be  $1$ factor of $17, 2$ of $19, 1$ of $23, 2$ of $29, 1$ of $31, 2$ of $37, 1$ of $41, 2$ of $43, 2$ of $47, 2$ of $53, 1$ of $59, 2$ of $61, 2$ of $67, 2$ of $71, 1$ of $73, 2$ of $79, 1$ of $83, 1$ of $89, 1$ of $97$.\n\n\n\nNow, $\\frac{200!}{100! \\times 100!} =  2^{99} \\times 3^{66} \\times 5^{94} \\times 7^{33} \\times 11^9 \\times 13^7 \\time 17^1 \\times 19^2 \\times 23^1 \\times 29^2 \\times 31^1 \\times 37^2 \\times 41^1 \\times 43^2 \\times 47^2 \\times 53^2 \\times 59^1 \\times 61^2 \\times 67^2 \\times 71^2 \\times 73^1 \\times 79^2 \\times 83^1 \\times 89^1 \\times 97^1$\n\nConsidering only two-digit prime factors such as $11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97$ we can get larger numbers like  97 which is a prime larger than $97$ but if you check the powers of larger primes larger than 2 digits ,such as $89, 83 ,79, 97$: they won't have any power because if you add by integer multiples those will go  equal to or larger to  $100$,which means there is no larger factors left.\n\n\n\nIn order to get the largest 2 digit prime factor, let's find that in the prime factors obtained above.
