    "To calculate the probability that Jane wins, we need to determine the total number of outcomes and the number of outcomes where Jane wins. \n\nThe total number of outcomes is the product of the number of possibilities for Jane's spin and the number of possibilities for her brother's spin. Since the spinner has five congruent sectors, each of them can spin any number from 1 to 5. Thus, the total number of outcomes is $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$.\n\nNow let's consider the cases in which Jane wins. If Jane's spin is less than 3 more or less (or equal to) than her brother's spin, then Jane wins. \n1. When Jane spins 1, she can win in 5 cases: a 1, a 2, a 3, a 4, or a 5 from her brother (since 0 - 4 is a non-negative difference less than 3). \n2. When Jane spins 2, she can win in 4 cases: a 0, a 1, a 2, or a 3 from her brother (since 1 - 3 is a non-negative difference less than 3). \n3. When Jane spins 3, she can win in 3 cases: a 0, a 1, or a 2 from her brother (since 1 - 2 is a non-negative difference less than 3). \n4. When Jane spins 4, she can win in 2 cases: a 0, or a 1 from her brother (since 0 - 1 is a non-negative difference less than 3). \n5. When Jane spins 5, she can win in 1 case: a 0 (from her brother) (since 0 is a non-negative difference less than 3).\n\nWe then calculate the sum of these winning cases to get the probability that Jane wins: \n\nWinning cases = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15 \n\nThe probability that Jane wins is $\\frac{15}{25}=\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\nSo the answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$",
    "To find the probability that Jane wins, we need to consider all the possible outcomes of Jane and her brother spinning the spinner.\n\nSince the spinner has 5 congruent sectors, each numbered from 1 to 5, there are 25 possible pairs of integers, $(x,y)$, that Jane and her brother can spin, where $x$ is Jane's number and $y$ is her brother's number.\n\nTo win the game, the non-negative difference of their numbers must be less than 3. We will list all possible combinations of $(x,y)$ where the difference $|x-y|$ is less than 3.\n\n1. When $|x-y|=0$, we have $x=y$ and there are 5 possible pairs.\n2. When $|x-y|=1$, we have $x=y+1$ or $x=y-1$, and there are a total of 16 possible pairs.\n3. When $|x-y|=2$, we have $x=y+2$ or $x=y-2$, and there are a total of 4 possible pairs.\n\nThe total number of winning combinations is 5 + 16 + 4 = 25.\n\nHowever, there are a total of 25 pairs $(x,y)$ possible pairs. \nTherefore, the probability that Jane wins is \n\n\\frac{25}{25}=1.\n\nHowever 25 outcomes was a counting error (5  + 16 + 4  = 25 outcomes, not pairs).\nA better number of total possible combinations is 5*5 = 25.\n\nSo, the probability that Jane wins is $\\frac{25}{25}$, which is equal to $\\boxed{1}$, but according to the question, I have to give you a common fraction so the answer is \n$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1}}$ \nwhich equals 1."

  "solution": "We consider the unordered pairs, or sets, of spins for which the difference of the numbers are greater than or equal to 3, or those games which Jane loses. These can only occur in the sets $\\{1, 4\\}$, $\\{1, 5 \\}$ or $\\{ 2, 5 \\}$. Each of these unordered pairs can occur in 2 orderings (depending on whether Jane or her brother spins each number). So, there are $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ losing combinations out of $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ for Jane. So, her winning probability is $1 - \\frac{6}{25} = \\boxed{\\frac{19}{25}}$.",
