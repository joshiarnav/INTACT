    "To compute $\\sin 60^\\circ$, we can use the unit circle and trigonometric identities. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the properties of a 30-60-90 right triangle.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the side opposite the 60-degree angle to the hypotenuse is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nSince $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}$, we can see that $\\sin 60^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.",
    "To compute $\\sin 60^\\circ$, we can use the unit circle or trigonometric identities.\n\nStep 1: Recall the definition of sine. Sine is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle.\n\nStep 2: We know that a 30-60-90 triangle has specific ratios of side lengths. The ratio of the sides opposite the 30\u00b0 angle and the 60\u00b0 angle to the hypotenuse are 1:2:\\sqrt{3}.\n\nStep 3: Since we want to find $\\sin 60^\\circ$, we look at the ratio of the side opposite the 60\u00b0 angle to the hypotenuse. In the 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the 60\u00b0 angle is $\\sqrt{3}$, and the hypotenuse is 2.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the value of $\\sin 60^\\circ$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$"

  "critique": "Both solutions 1 and 2 arrive at the same answer, which is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. However, solution 2 is more detailed and explicitly states each step of the process, making it easier to follow.\n\nTherefore, I would rate solution 2 as the best solution, so the index number is 2.",
