    "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to determine the range of the third side.\n\nAccording to the Triangle Inequality Theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side. \n\nFor this problem, we have two sides of length 5 and 6 units. \n\nSo, we can set up the inequality: \n\n- The sum of the lengths of the two shorter sides must be greater than the length of the longest side. \n- The sum of the lengths of the two shorter sides must be greater than or equal to the third side and also greater than the third side since all sides are integers.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The sum of the two shorter sides (5 and 6) is 11.\n2. The third side (x) must be less than 11 because the sum of the two shorter sides must be greater than the third side.\n\nNow, we can set up another inequality for the other condition:\n\n3. The sum of the lengths of the two shorter sides (5 and x) must be greater than or equal to the length of the longest side (6), but since x must be less than 11, we can limit it to 11 - 6 = 5 or more than 5 but less than 11.\n\nLet's input the valid range of x, x should be greater than or equal to 6 - 5 = 1 and less than 11 - 1 = 10, it\u2019s also in integer range.\n\nSince x should be less than 11 we can limit our valid x to be 1 through 10. inputting this into the formula P = x + 5 + 6 we get the following equation.\n\nLet P be the perimeter:\n\nP = 5 + 6 + x\n\nSo we can input our valid values of x to get the largest perimeter and it would be:\n\nLet's test our hypothesis:\n\nThe value of x that will give us the largest possible perimeter would be when x = 9.\n\nSo the largest possible perimeter of the triangle would be:\n\nP = 5 + 6 + 9 = 20 units\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{20}$.",
    "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem. This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nGiven sides of length 5 and 6, we can set up the following inequalities for the third side of length $x$:\n\n1. $x + 5 > 6$\n2. $x + 6 > 5$\n3. $5 + 6 > x$\n\nSimplifying each inequality, we get:\n\n1. $x > 1$\n2. $x > -1$\n3. $x < 11$\n\nSince $x$ is an integer, the valid range is from 2 to 10 (inclusive).\n\nNow, we need to find the largest possible value of the perimeter, which is given by $P = 5 + 6 + x$. To maximize the perimeter, we substitute $x$ with the largest possible integer value in the valid range, which is 10. Therefore, the largest possible perimeter is:\n\n$P = 5 + 6 + 10 = 21$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$",

This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side.\n\nLet's denote the lengths of the three sides as 5, 6, and $x$.\n\nThe triangle inequality conditions for this triangle are:\n1. $5 + 6 > x$\n2. $5 + x > 6$\n3. $6 + x > 5$\n\nNow we can simplify these conditions:\n1. $11 > x$\n2. $x > 1$\n3. $x > -1$\n\nFor the third inequality, we already know $x > -1$, so it's always true.\n\nFrom the first inequality, we have $x < 11$.\n\nAnd the second inequality tells us $x > 1$.\n\nSince the length $x$ has to be an integer and the upper limit is 11, to find the largest possible perimeter, we should consider the largest integer less than 11, which is 10. This satisfies the inequality conditions.\n\nSo, we have $x = 10$.\n\nThe perimeter is given by the formula: $P = 5 + 6 + 10$\n\nNow, let's calculate it: \n$P = 21$\n\nThus, the largest possible perimeter is 21 units.\n\n$\\boxed{21}$"

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, we need to compare the results from each solution. \n\nSolution 1: 20 units\nSolution 2: 21 units\nSolution 3: 21 units\n\nSince Solution 2 and Solution 3 have the same result (21 units) and it is the largest among the three, we can consider them as the best solutions. However, since the question asks for the index number of the best solution, we will consider the first one that provides the correct answer as the best solution.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2 or Solution 3, but since Solution 2 was provided first, the index number of the best solution is 2.",
  "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",
