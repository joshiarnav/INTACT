    "To find the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$, we need to express $a_2$ and $a_3$ in terms of the common ratio of the geometric sequence.\n\nGiven:\n- $a_1 = 1$\n- Let the common ratio be $r$.\n\nFor a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by the common ratio.\n\nThus:\n- $a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r = 1 \\cdot r = r$\n- $a_3 = a_2 \\cdot r = r \\cdot r = r^2$\n\nNow, rewrite $4a_2 + 5a_3$ in terms of $r$:\n\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2$\n\nTo find the minimum value of this expression, we can complete the square:\n\n$4r + 5r^2 = 5\\left(r^2 + \\frac{4}{5}r\\right)$\n\n$= 5\\left(r^2 + \\frac{4}{5}r + \\frac{4}{25} - \\frac{4}{25}\\right)$\n\n$= 5\\left(\\left(r + \\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 - \\frac{4}{25}\\right)$\n\nSince $\\left(r + \\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2$ is always non-negative (or zero at $r = -\\frac{2}{5}$), the minimum value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$ occurs when this term is zero:\n\n$\\left(r + \\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 = 0$\n\n$r = -\\frac{2}{5}$\n\nSubstituting this value of $r$ back into the expression for $4a_2 + 5a_3$ or the original equation when put in its place, we get:\n\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2 = 4(-\\frac{2}{5}) + 5(-\\frac{2}{5})^2$\n\n$= -\\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{20}{25}$\n\n$= -\\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{4}{5}$\n\n$= -\\frac{4}{5}$\n\nThus, the minimum value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}}$.",
    "To find the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$, we can utilize the properties of a geometric sequence. A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio ('r').\n\nGiven $a_1 = 1$ and that $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $a_3$ form a geometric sequence, we have:\n\n- $a_1 = 1$\n- $a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r = 1 \\cdot r = r$\n- $a_3 = a_2 \\cdot r = r \\cdot r = r^2$\n\nNow, we can express $4a_2 + 5a_3$ in terms of $r$ as:\n\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2$\n\nTo minimize the value of $4r + 5r^2$, we recognize that $4r + 5r^2$ is a quadratic equation in the form of $ar^2 + br + c$, where $a = 5$, $b = 4$, and $c = 0$.\n\nTo find the minimum value of a quadratic equation $ar^2 + br + c$, we can use the formula $r = -\\frac{b}{2a}$ to find the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of a parabola in the form $ar^2 + br + c$ is the lowest or highest point of the parabola. For the case where $a > 0$ (which is our case here since $a = 5 > 0$), the point at the vertex is the minimum point of the parabola.\n\nNow, let's calculate the minimum point of our quadratic equation:\n\n$r = -\\frac{b}{2a}$\n$r = -\\frac{4}{2 \\cdot 5}$\n$r = -\\frac{4}{10}$\n$r = -\\frac{2}{5}$\n\nTo find the minimum value of $4r + 5r^2$, we plug the value of $r$ into the equation $4r + 5r^2$:\n\n$4r + 5r^2 = 4 \\cdot \\left( -\\frac{2}{5} \\right) + 5 \\cdot \\left( -\\frac{2}{5} \\right)^2$\n$4r + 5r^2 = \\frac{-8}{5} + \\frac{20}{25}$\n$4r + 5r^2 = \\frac{-8}{5} + \\frac{4}{5}$  (After simplifying the fraction $\\frac{20}{25}$).\n$4r + 5r^2 = \\frac{-8 + 4}{5}$\n$4r + 5r^2 = \\frac{-4}{5}$\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}}$."

  "critique": "Both solutions are correct and yield the same result. However, I will evaluate them based on their clarity, concision, and adherence to mathematical conventions.\n\nSolution 1 is a bit more detailed and provides a clear step-by-step process for completing the square. However, it uses more words than necessary and could be condensed for better readability.\n\nSolution 2 is more concise and directly applies the formula for finding the vertex of a quadratic equation. It also avoids the need for completing the square, making it a more straightforward solution.\n\nBased on these factors, I would rate Solution 2 as the better solution.\n\nThe best solution is: 2",
