    "To find the slant asymptote of the rational expression, we can use the technique of long division or synthetic division. \n\nThe given equation is $y = \\frac{2x^2 + 3x - 7}{x - 3}$. \n\nTo simplify the expression, divide the numerator $2x^2 + 3x - 7$ by $x - 3$ using long division (you can also use synthetic division, but the process is the same). \n\nDividing $2x^2 + 3x - 7$ by $x - 3$, we get:\n\nThe quotient is $2x + 9$ with a remainder of $-20$. \n\nSo the expression can be simplified to:\n\n$y = (2x + 9) + \\frac{-20}{x-3}$\n\nNow, as $x$ approaches $\\infty$ or $-\\infty$, the term $\\frac{-20}{x-3}$ approaches $0$.\n\nTherefore, the slant asymptote of the rational expression is $y = 2x + 9$.\n\nSince the slant asymptote is of the form $y = mx + b$, we can identify:\n\n$m = 2$\n$b = 9$\n\nNow, let's find $m + b$:\n\n$m + b = 2 + 9 = 11$\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{11}$.",

  "solution": "To approach this problem, we can either use long division or synthetic division to evaluate the quotient of the given rational expression. Alternatively, we can rewrite the numerator as $2x^2 + 3x - 7$ $ = 2x^2 + 3x - 7 - 9x + 9x$ $ = 2x(x-3) + 9x - 7 - 20 + 20$ $ = 2x(x-3) + 9(x-3) + 20$. Hence, $$y = \\frac{2x^2 + 3x - 7}{x-3} = \\frac{(2x+9)(x-3) + 20}{x-3} = 2x+9 +\\frac{20}{x-3}.$$As $x$ approaches infinity or negative infinity, then the fraction approaches $0$, and $y$ approaches $2x + 9$.Thus, $m+b = \\boxed{11}.$ [asy]\nimport graph; size(7cm); real lsf=0.5; pen dps=linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10); defaultpen(dps); pen ds=black; real xmin=-27.84,xmax=46.9,ymin=-33.28,ymax=45.43;\n\nLabel laxis; laxis.p=fontsize(10);\n\nxaxis(xmin,xmax,Ticks(laxis,Step=20.0,Size=2,NoZero),Arrows(6),above=true); yaxis(ymin,ymax,Ticks(laxis,Step=20.0,Size=2,NoZero),Arrows(6),above=true); real f1(real x){return (2*x^2+3*x-7)/(x-3);} draw(graph(f1,-27.83,2.99),linewidth(1)); draw(graph(f1,3.01,46.89),linewidth(1)); draw((xmin,2*xmin+9)--(xmax,2*xmax+9), linetype(\"2 2\"));\n\nlabel(\"$y = \\frac{2x^2 + 3x - 7}{x - 3}$\",(5.67,-27.99),NE*lsf); label(\"$y = 2x + 9$\",(18.43,35.5),NE*lsf);\n\nclip((xmin,ymin)--(xmin,ymax)--(xmax,ymax)--(xmax,ymin)--cycle);\n\n[/asy]",
