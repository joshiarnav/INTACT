    "To find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, let's represent the three integers as follows:\n\n- Integer 1: $24k + 10$, where $k$ is an integer.\n- Integer 2: $24l + 4$, where $l$ is an integer.\n- Integer 3: $24m + 12$, where $m$ is an integer.\n\nNow, let's add the three integers:\n\n$(24k + 10) + (24l + 4) + (24m + 12)$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$24k + 24l + 24m + 10 + 4 + 12$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$24(k + l + m) + 26$\n\nTo simplify further and make it easier to find the remainder when dividing by $24$, we can rewrite $26$ as $24 + 2$. The equation becomes:\n\n$24(k + l + m) + 24 + 2$\n\nNow, add $24(k + l + m) + 24$ to the terms:\n\n$24(k + l + m + 1) + 2$\n\nNow, since $24(k + l + m + 1)$ is a multiple of $24$, when the total is divided by $24$, the remainder is simply the remainder of $2$ when divided by $24$.\n\nSo, the remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "To find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Let the three integers be $a$, $b$, and $c$. When these integers are divided by $24$, the remainders are $10$, $4$, and $12$, respectively.\n\n2. We can express these integers in the form:\n   - $a = 24p + 10$ (where $p$ is an integer)\n   - $b = 24q + 4$ (where $q$ is an integer)\n   - $c = 24r + 12$ (where $r$ is an integer)\n\n3.

Now, let's find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$. We can rewrite $26$ as $24 + 2$:\n   - $a + b + c = 24(p + q + r) + 24 + 2$\n\n6. Factor out $24$:\n   - $a + b + c = 24(p + q + r + 1) + 2$\n\n7. This expression is in the form $24k + r$ (where $k$ is an integer), and we want to find the remainder when this expression is divided by $24$.\n   - Since $a + b + c = 24(p + q + r + 1) + 2$, the remainder is $2$ when the sum is divided by $24$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \n   - $\\boxed{2}$."
