    "To find the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime, we need to identify these primes first.\n\nOne-digit primes are: 2, 3, 5, 7\n\nThe two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7.\n\nNow, we need to find the largest two-digit prime. To do this, we will check primes in the two-digit numbers from 99 downwards.\n\nThe largest two-digit prime is 97 (since 99 is divisible by 3).\n\nSo, the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime is: 5 * 7 * 97\n\nCalculating this gives: 5 * 7 = 35\nThen, 35 * 97 = 3395\n\nTherefore, the answer is: $\\boxed{3395}$",

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, let's analyze each solution for clarity, correct steps, and conciseness.\n\nSolution 1 is clear and concise, and it directly addresses the problem by first identifying the two largest one-digit primes and then finding the largest two-digit prime. It also checks for divisibility to confirm the largest two-digit prime.\n\nSolution 2 is similar to Solution 1 but provides a more comprehensive list of two-digit primes to verify the largest two-digit prime. However, it has an extra step of listing all two-digit primes, which is not necessary.\n\nSolution 3 has an error in the list of one-digit primes, as 11 is not a one-digit prime. It also lists all two-digit primes to find the largest one, which is unnecessary.\n\nConsidering the clarity, conciseness, and accuracy of the solutions, Solution 1 is the best solution.\n\nThe index of the best solution is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "solution": "The two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7; the largest two-digit prime is 97 (98 and 99 are both composite).  The product of these three primes is $5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 97 = 35 \\cdot 97 = 35(100-3)=3500-105=\\boxed{3395}$.",
