  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and yield the same result, which is the area of $S'$ as 44. However, I will evaluate them based on clarity, concision, and adherence to the problem statement.\n\nSolution 1 and Solution 3 are very similar in terms of presentation and are both clear and concise. However, Solution 1 could be improved by simply stating the determinant calculation without explicitly stating the formula for the determinant of a 2x2 matrix.\n\nSolution 2 is also clear and concise but appears to be a duplication of Solution 1 with minor variations in wording.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would rate Solution 1 as the best solution due to its clear and concise presentation.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "Note that\n\\[\\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ 7 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(7) = 11,\\]so the matrix scales the area of any region by a factor of 11.  In particular, the area of $S'$ is $11 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{44}.$",
