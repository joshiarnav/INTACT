    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the concept of dilation in the complex plane. A dilation centered at a point $c$ with a scale factor $k$ is a transformation that maps every point $z$ in the complex plane to the point $c + k(z - c)$.\n2. In our case, the dilation is centered at the point $-1 + 4i$, with a scale factor of $-2$. \n3. We want to find where the complex number $2i$ is mapped under this dilation.\n4. To do this, we will use the formula for dilation: $c + k(z - c)$, where $c = -1 + 4i$ and $k = -2$.\n5. Plugging in the values of $c$ and $k$, we get:\n$(-1 + 4i) + (-2)(2i - (-1 + 4i))$\n6. Now, let's simplify this expression.\n\nExpanding the expression, we get:\n$(-1 + 4i) + (-2)(2i + 1 - 4i)$\n\nSimplifying the expression further, we get:\n$(-1 + 4i) + (-2)(1 - 2i)$\n\nExpanding the expression again, we get:\n$(-1 + 4i) + (-2 + 4i)$\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n$-3 + 8i$\n\nTherefore, the complex number $2i$ is mapped to $-3 + 8i$ under the dilation centered at $-1 + 4i$ with a scale factor of $-2$.\n\n$\\boxed{-3 + 8i}$"
