Using one or both of the school colors, how many different flags are possible if adjacent stripes may be the same color?\n\n[asy]\nsize(75);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,12));\ndot((0,12));\ndraw((0,12)--(8,12)--(8,11)--(0,11));\ndraw((8,11)--(8,9)--(0,9));\ndraw((8,9)--(8,6)--(0,6));\n[/asy]",

    "To determine the number of different flags possible, we need to consider the color options for each of the three horizontal stripes.\n\nThe top stripe can be either purple or gold. We have 2 options for the top stripe.\n\nThe middle stripe can also be either purple or gold. Since adjacent stripes may be the same color, we also have 2 options for the middle stripe.\n\nThe bottom stripe can be either purple or gold. Again, we have 2 options for the bottom stripe.\n\nTo find the total number of different flags possible, we need to multiply the number of options for each stripe together: $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{8}$ different flags possible.",
    "Let's break down the possibilities step by step:\n\n1. The top stripe can be either purple or gold, so there are 2 possibilities for the top stripe.\n2. The middle stripe can be either purple or gold, regardless of the color of the top stripe, so there are also 2 possibilities for the middle stripe.\n3. The bottom stripe can be either purple or gold, regardless of the colors of the top and middle stripes, so there are also 2 possibilities for the bottom stripe.\n\nSince the possibilities for each stripe are independent, we can multiply the number of possibilities for each stripe to find the total number of possible flags:\n\n2 (top stripe) \u00d7 2 (middle stripe) \u00d7 2 (bottom stripe) = 4 \u00d7 2 = 8\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{8}$ possible flags.\n\nIf we list the possible flags in order from top to bottom, we get: gold, purple, gold; gold, purple, purple; gold, gold, purple; purple, purple, gold; gold, gold, gold; gold, purple, purple; purple, gold, gold; purple, purple, purple."
