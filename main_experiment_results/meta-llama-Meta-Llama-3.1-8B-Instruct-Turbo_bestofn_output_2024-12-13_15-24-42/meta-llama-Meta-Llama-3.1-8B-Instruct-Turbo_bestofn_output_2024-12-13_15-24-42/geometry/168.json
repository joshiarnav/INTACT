    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\n1. **Draw a diagram and identify key points**: Draw a diagram with the intersecting square and circle. Label the center of the circle as O, a vertex of the square as A, and the midpoint of the chord as M.\n\n2. **Identify useful geometric properties**: The line from the center O to M is perpendicular to the chord. This is because the line from the center of a circle to a midpoint of a chord is always perpendicular to that chord.\n\n3. **Find the length of the side of the square**: Since each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle, the length of the side of the square is twice the radius (twice the chord length), because the vertex A of the square divides the chord into two equal halves, thus making the length of the side of the square equal to diameter of the circle. So, the side length of the square is 2r, where r is the radius of the circle.\n\n4. **Find the area of the square**: The area of a square is found by squaring the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the square is (2r)^2 = 4r^2.\n\n5. **Find the area of the circle**: The area of a circle is given by the formula \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius of the circle.\n\n6. **Find the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle**: The ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is the area of the square divided by the area of the circle: (4r^2)/(\u03c0r^2).\n\n7. **Simplify the ratio**: We can cancel out r^2 from the numerator and denominator to get 4/\u03c0, since r^2/r^2 is 1.\n\nThe ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is 4/\u03c0.\n\nSo, the final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{\\pi}}$",
    "To find the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle, we need to first find the radii and areas of both the circle and square.\n\nGiven: A circle and a square intersect so each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle.\n\nLet's denote the radius of the circle as $r$. \n\nDraw a line from the center of the circle to the point where the chord intersects the circle. This bisects both the chord and the angle formed by the chord and the radius.\n\nGiven the chord's length is equal to a side of the square and the chord bisects, $\\frac{r}{2}$ is the height of the isosceles triangle formed by the two radii and the chord. The base of this isosceles triangle is $r$, and we can find its area by the formula $\\frac{b \\times h}{2} = \\frac{r \\times \\frac{r}{2}}{2} = \\frac{r^2}{4}$. \n\nNow, let's consider another triangle formed by half of the square, one radius of the circle, and the line segment joining the center of the circle to one of the vertices of the half-square. The height of this triangle (which equals the half-length of the side of the square) can be found using Pythagorean theorem applied to the right triangle:\n\n$\\left( \\frac{r}{2} \\right)^2 + h^2 = r^2$\n\n$h = \\sqrt{r^2 - \\left( \\frac{r}{2} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{r^2 - \\frac{r^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3r^2}{4}}$\n\n$h = \\frac{r \\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nSince this height is the half-length of the side of the square, we have the full length of the side as $r \\sqrt{3}$. We can now calculate the area of the square as $s^2 = (r \\sqrt{3})^2 = 3r^2$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the area of the circle, which is given by the formula $A = \\pi r^2$.\n\nThe ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is given by:\n\n$\\frac{\\text{Area of Square}}{\\text{Area of Circle}} = \\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2} = \\frac{3}{\\pi}$\n\nSo, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the problem**: \nWe have a square and a circle that intersect each other. \nEach side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle.\n\n2. **Visualizing the problem**:\nImagine drawing a diagram with a square and a circle intersecting each other. \nWe can draw the square as ABCD and connect the ends of the chords touching the square, to form a smaller circle with a radius half the radius of the main circle.\n\n3. **Calculating the angle of the intersection**:\nSince each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle, the chord divides the circle into two segments. \nThe chord forms a right-angled triangle with the radius of the circle and the segment of the radius joined at the circle's center.\n\nBy drawing a line from the center of the circle to a point on the chord and then to the edge of the circle, we can see that the triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle, since the line from the center to the chord is equal in length to half the radius.\n\nGiven that, let the central angle connecting the ends of the chords (top and bottom of the square) be 2\u03b8.\n\n4. **Finding \u03b8**:\nUsing the 30-60-90 triangle, we know that tan(30\u00b0) = 1 /\u221a3. Since the triangle is part of the sector of the circle, we have a ratio between its sides of r / 2, r, and r\u221a3 for the sides that are opposite 30\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 respectively.\n\nFrom the given data, we know that the side length of the square (2r) forms the side that would be opposite the 90\u00b0 angle in the triangle (r, r\u221a3, 2r), when looking at the diagram described in step 3. Since r and r\u221a3 are in the same ratio as 1 and \u221a3, the ratio between the radius of the circle and the chord of length r is \u221a3.\n\nUsing a SOH CAH TOA, we can see the relationship between a 30-60-90 triangle.\n\n\u03b8 = 60\u00b0 in the triangle, which makes it (1/6) * 360\u00b0 = 60\u00b0, in the circle, which would be the range of the angle cut out.\n\nTherefore, the other angle we're looking for is 60\u00b0 or half the value of 120\u00b0 since the segment formed is 120\u00b0 since 2\u03b8 is 120\u00b0.\n\n5. **Finding the radius of the circle and the area of the circle**:\nFor the full scenario of the circle's radius, when the value of the radius of the smaller circle is known the value of the radius of the circle touching the square is double, two times that radius.\n\n6. **Finding the side length of the square**:\nSince each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius, the side length of the square is the same as the diameter of the circle, which is twice the radius of the circle.\n\nGiven that the side length of the square is twice the radius of the circle, the diagonal of the square will also be twice the radius of the circle.\n\n7. **Finding the area of the square and the area of the circle**:\nArea of the square = side length * side length = (2 * radius of the circle) * (2 * radius of the circle) = 4 * radius of the circle * radius of the circle.\n\nArea of the circle = \u03c0 * radius of the circle * radius of the circle\n\n8. **Finding the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle**:\nWe can now calculate the ratio:\n\nratio = (4 * radius of the circle * radius of the circle) / (\u03c0 * radius of the circle * radius of the circle) \n\nratio = 4 / \u03c0\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is 4 / \u03c0.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{\\pi}}$"

  "solution": "Drawing a diagram and adding $OM$ perpendicular to $AD$, we get\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-1,1);\nB=(1,1);\nC=(1,-1);\nD=(-1,-1);\nE=(-1,-.577);\nF=(-1,.577);\nM=(-1,0);\ndraw(circle(O,1.155));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--A);\ndraw(F--O);\ndraw(O--E);\ndraw(O--M);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"F\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, dir(0));\nlabel(\"M\", M, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (F+O)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (E+O)/2, SE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", M, W);\n[/asy] First note that $O$ is not only the center of the circle but also the center of the square since the diagram is symmetric. Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$.
