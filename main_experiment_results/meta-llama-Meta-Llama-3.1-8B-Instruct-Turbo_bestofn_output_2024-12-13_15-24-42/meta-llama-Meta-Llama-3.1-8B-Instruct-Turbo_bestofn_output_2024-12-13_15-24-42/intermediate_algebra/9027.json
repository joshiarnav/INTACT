    "To find the greatest possible value of \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \\), we can use a polynomial factorization trick involving the given system of equations.\n\nLet's define a polynomial:\n\\[p(x) = (x^2 + ax + c)(x^2 + bx + d) = x^4 + (a + b)x^3 + (ab + c + d)x^2 + (ad + bc + cd)x + cd.\\]\n\nUsing the given system of equations, we can express \\( p(x) \\) as:\n\\[p(x) = x^4 + 15x^3 + 78x^2 + 160x + 96.\\]\n\nWe can factorize the polynomial $p(x)$ to get its roots. \n\nFirst, we factor the polynomial to get \\begin{align*}\np(x) &= (x^2 - 4x + 16)(x^2 + 19x + 6)\\\\\n&= (x - 2)^2(x + 19)(x + 3).\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the polynomial $p(x)$ has the roots $2, 2, -19,$ and $-3$.\n\nNow we can use the information we have to calculate the square sums using a different method: methods to try to figure out which of the values for $a, b, c, d$ correspond to the different roots.\n\nWe observe that roots are all different. We pair $a$ and $b$ with the root $2$ to see if that would lead to any result. This means we have\\begin{align*}\n(x-2)^2  &=(x-(a))(x-b)\\\\\n&=x^2- (a+b)x+ab\\\\\n&=x^2 -15x + 16\n\\end{align*}We compare it with the given expression \\begin{align*}\np(x) &= x^4 + 15x^3 + 78x^2 + 160x + 96\\\\\n&= (x-2)^2(x + 19)(x + 3)\\\\\n&= x^4 + 21x^3 + (-40)x^2 + (43x + 4x^2) + (-114)x + 12 x^2 + 116 x + 57\n\\end{align*} which is not the same. But $a$ and $b$ must both be $2$ because $2$ is a repeated root for the expression $(x-2)^2$. Then $(a, b,  c, d) = (2, 2, c, d)$. But that forces $(c, d)$ to be a root of $(x^2+19x+6)$. Then $(c, d)$ must be $(-19, -3)$, so $(a, b, c, d) = (2, 2, -19, -3)$.\n\nWe can use the given equation to find the square of $(a, b, c, d)$ which is $(2, 2, -19, -3)$.\n\nUsing the expression \\[a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2 = (2 + 2 + (-19) + (-3))^2 = (-16)^2.\\]\n\nHence, the greatest possible value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ is $\\boxed{256}$",
    "To find the greatest possible value of $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$, let's consider the given system of equations.\n\nFirst, we note that the given system of equations resembles the structure of a quadratic equation. We can define a polynomial $p(x)$ as\n\\[p(x) = (x^2 + ax + c)(x^2 + bx + d) = x^4 + (a+b)x^3 + (ab+c+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + cd.\\]\n\nWe are given that the system of equations has a solution $(a, b, c, d)$ such that\n\\[a + b = 15,\\]\n\\[ab + c + d = 78,\\]\n\\[ad + bc = 160,\\]\n\\[cd = 96.\\]\n\nLet's substitute the values into our polynomial equation and relate them to each other using $p(x)$. \n\n\\[p(x) = x^4 + (a+b)x^3 + (ab+c+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + cd = x^4 + 15x^3 + 78x^2 + 160x + 96.\\]\n\nWe can factorize $p(x)$ to obtain the roots. Factoring quadratic polynomials can be challenging; however, we can attempt to factorize by guessing the roots of $p(x)$ or use polynomial factorization techniques. \n\nGiven the structure of $p(x)$, let's try to factorize it by taking its roots as $(x-r_1)(x-r_2)$ and $(x-s_1)(x-s_2)$. Let's substitute the factors to see if we can obtain the given polynomial.\n\nOnce we have factorized the polynomial, we can find the possible combinations of $(a, b, c, d)$ that satisfy the system of equations, and then calculate $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ for each combination.\n\nNow, let's factorize the polynomial $p(x)$.\n\n\nWe are looking for a factorization of\n\\[x^4 + 15x^3 + 78x^2 + 160x + 96.\\]\n\nWe take the factors $(x^2+rx+s)$ and $(x^2+px+q)$, where $r$ and $s$ are coefficients of the first quadratic factor and $p$ and $q$ are coefficients of the second quadratic factor.\n\nAfter some trial and error method, the polynomial factorizes into\n\\[ (x^2 + 4x + 6)(x^2 + 11x + 16). \\]\n\nLet's now determine the possible combinations of coefficients for each quadratic factor to get $(a,b,c,d)$. For each quadratic factor we get the following (a,b,c,d):\n\n-  (x^2 + 4x + 6) yields (a,b,c,d) as (2, 13, 6, 1)\n- (x^2 + 11x + 16) yields (a,b,c,d) as (8, 7, 16, 1)\n\nNow we calculate $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$ for the above possibilities of $(a, b, c, d)$.\nFor the first possibility (a,b,c,d) = (2,13,6,1), we get:\n\\[2^2+13^2+6^2+1^2 = 4+169+36+1=210.\\]\n\nFor the second possibility (a,b,c,d) = (8,7,16,1), we get:\n\\[8^2+7^2+16^2+1^2 = 64+49+256+1=370.\\]\n\nFrom the two possibilities, the greatest possible value of $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$ is $\\boxed{370}$",
