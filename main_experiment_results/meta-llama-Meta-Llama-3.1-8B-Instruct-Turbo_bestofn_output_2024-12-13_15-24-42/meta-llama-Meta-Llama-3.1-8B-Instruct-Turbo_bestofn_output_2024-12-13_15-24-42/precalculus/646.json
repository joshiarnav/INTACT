    "To find $x$ so that the vectors are orthogonal, we need to use the fact that the dot product of two orthogonal vectors is zero.\n\nThe dot product of the two vectors is $(2)(x) + (5)(-3)$.\n\nSet the dot product equal to zero:\n\n$2x - 15 = 0$\n\nNow, solve for $x$:\n\n$2x = 15$\n\n$x = \\frac{15}{2}$\n\nSo, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{7.5}$.",

  "critique": "Both solutions are correct and yield the same result. However, Solution 2 is slightly more detailed in its explanation of the dot product formula. \n\nBut since Solution 1 also explains the dot product correctly and is more concise, I would say they are both equally good. However, if I had to choose, I would say Solution 1 is slightly better.\n\nSo, the index number of the best solution is 1.",
  "solution": "For the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$ to be orthogonal, their dot product should be 0:\n\\[(2)(x) + (5)(-3) = 0.\\]Solving, we find $x = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{2}}.$",
