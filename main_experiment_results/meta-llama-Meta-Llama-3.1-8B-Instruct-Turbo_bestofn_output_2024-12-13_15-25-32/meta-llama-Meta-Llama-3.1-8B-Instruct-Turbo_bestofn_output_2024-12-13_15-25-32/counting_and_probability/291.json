    "We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $7!$ and $(5!)^2.$\n\nStep 1: Calculate the value of $7!$. \n$7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040.$\n\nStep 2: Calculate the value of $(5!)^2$.\n$(5!)^2 = (5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1)^2 = 120^2 = 14400.$\n\nStep 3: Determine the prime factors of $7!$ and $(5!)^2.$\nFor $7!$: \n$7! = 5040 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7.$\n\nFor $(5!)^2$: \n$(5!)^2 = 14400 = 2^8 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2.$\n\nStep 4: Identify the common prime factors between $7!$ and $(5!)^2.$ The common prime factors are $2^4$, $3^2$, and $5^1$. The $5^1$ is because even though it is squared in $(5!)^2$, it remains the lowest exponent that can divide the expressions in common.\n\nStep 5: Determine the product of the common prime factors with the lowest exponent that can be divided into both. \nThe common prime factors with the lowest exponents are $2^4$, $3^2$, and $5^1$. \nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of $7!$ and $(5!)^2$ is $2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 = 16 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 720.$\n\n$\\boxed{720}$",

  "critique": "Based on the given solutions, Solution 1 and Solution 2 are identical and correctly solve the problem. Solution 3 also correctly solves the problem but with a slightly different approach.\n\nHowever, considering the clarity, conciseness, and step-by-step explanation, Solution 1 and Solution 2 stand out as the best solutions.
