    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of combinations of 4 crayons from a total of 12 crayons, where the order does not matter.\n\nStep 1: Understand that since the order doesn't matter, we are looking for combinations, not permutations.\n\nStep 2: Use the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!), where n is the total number of items (12 crayons in this case), and r is the number of items being chosen (4 crayons).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the factorial of 12: 12! = 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 479,001,600.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the factorial of 4 (r): 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the factorial of (n - r): (12 - 4)! = 8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40,320.\n\nStep 6: Plug these values into the combination formula: C(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * 8!) = 479,001,600 / (24 * 40,320).\n\nStep 7: Simplify the fraction: C(12, 4) = 479,001,600 / 967,680 = 495.\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{495}$",
