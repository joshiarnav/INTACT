    "To compute $\\sin 60^\\circ$, we need to recall the unit circle and the definition of sine as the y-coordinate of a point on the unit circle.\n\n1. Draw a unit circle centered at the origin (0, 0).\n2. Label the point where the angle $60^\\circ$ intercepts the unit circle. Since it's $60^\\circ$, the point will be in the first quadrant.\n3. Draw the radius from the origin to the point, which is a line segment from (0, 0) to the intercept point. Since it's a unit circle, the length of this radius is 1.\n4. Form a right-angled triangle with this radius as the hypotenuse and the x and y coordinates as the other two sides.\n5. The length of the x-coordinate can be found using the cosine of the angle ($\\cos 60^\\circ$), which is $\\frac{1}{2}$. \n6. Now to calculate the y-coordinate, note that $\\sin$ and $\\cos$ are complementary angles for $30^\\circ$. Since $\\sin (30^\\circ)$ is 1/2 and that $60^\\circ$ is a $30^\\circ+30^\\circ$ angle, we can recognize it's a $30-60-90$ special right triangle.\n\nUsing that $30-60-90$ triangle rule we know the $\\sin(60^\\circ) = \\sin(90^\\circ-30^\\circ)$ that makes $\\sin(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nUsing the $30-60-90$ special triangle properties and trigonometry, the values for such special angles will be the following.\n$\\sin(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}$, $\\cos(30^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\nHence using complementary angles, that is,\n$\\sin(60^\\circ) = \\cos(30^\\circ)$ which gives us\n$\\sin(60^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\nTherefore,\n$\\boxed{\\sin(60^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$",

    "To compute $\\sin 60^\\circ$, we need to understand the unit circle and the relationship between angles and trigonometric functions.\n\nRecall that the sine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nHowever, in this case, we're dealing with a unit circle, where the radius (hypotenuse) is 1. The angle of $60^\\circ$ will create a right-angled triangle with a known side length.\n\nSince $60^\\circ$ is half of $120^\\circ$, which is a special angle in a triangle with side ratios 1:\u221a3:2 (1, the other shorter side, the longer side, and the hypotenuse respectively), we can calculate the sine as follows:\n\n1. Draw a unit circle and an angle of $60^\\circ$ with the x-axis.\n2. In the right triangle formed, identify the opposite and adjacent sides: the opposite side to the angle is (1/2) and the adjacent side is (\u221a3/2).\n3. According to the definition of sine, we have: sin 60\u00b0 = opposite side / hypotenuse\n4. Since the length of the hypotenuse is 1 (radius of the unit circle), we have:\nsin 60\u00b0 = (\u221a3/2) / 1\n5. Simplify the equation to get:\nsin 60\u00b0 = (\u221a3)/2 \n\nThus, we have $\\boxed{(\\sqrt{3}/2)}$"
