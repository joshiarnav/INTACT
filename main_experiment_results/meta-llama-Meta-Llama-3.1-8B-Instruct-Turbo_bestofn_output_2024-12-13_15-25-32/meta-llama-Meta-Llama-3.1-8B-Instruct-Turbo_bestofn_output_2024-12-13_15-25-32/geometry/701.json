    "To find the area of the regular octagon, we can divide it into smaller shapes whose areas we know how to calculate, such as squares and triangles.\n\nStep 1: The square $BDEF$ has a side length of $1 + \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nStep 2: Connect the centers of opposite sides of the square, $AD$ and $BE$, to form two right isosceles triangles, $\\triangle AEB$ and $\\triangle CFD$, within the square. These triangles are the main components used in finding the area of the octagon.\n\nStep 3: Since the triangle is a right isosceles triangle and half of the square, $\\overline{AD}$ has a length of $(1+\\sqrt{2})\\div 2 = \\sqrt{2}+1\\div 2.$ The triangle has a base of $1 + \\sqrt{2}$ and $a$ height of $\\sqrt{2}$. Draw $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BE}$.\n\nStep 4: Now let us focus on the octagon. The 4 triangles formed between the octagon's vertices and the square's midpoints will have sides of  $1$ and the height of $\\sqrt{2}$ - 1. These four triangles have areas that can be calculated as   $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot (\\sqrt{2}-1) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{2}.$\n\n\nStep 5: Add the four smaller triangles areas together to find the area of the four small triangles in terms of square units: $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{2} \\cdot 4 = 2\\sqrt{2} - 2.$\n\nStep 6: The area of the octagon can be found by subtracting the area of the four triangles from the area of the square. To do this, we will calculate the area of the square and then subtract the area of the four smaller triangles from it.\n\nThe square's area is:   $(1+\\sqrt{2})^2=1^2+(\\sqrt{2})^2+2\\cdot1\\cdot\\sqrt{2}=1+2+2\\cdot1\\cdot\\sqrt{2}=3+2\\cdot1\\cdot\\sqrt{2}.$\n\nSo the area of the octagon can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Area of octagon}&=\\text{Area of square - (Area of 4 smaller triangles)}\\\\\n&=(3+2\\cdot1\\cdot\\sqrt{2}) - (2\\sqrt{2}-2)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{5}.\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
    "To find the area of the regular octagon, we need to break it down into known shapes. Since square $BDEF$ is given, we can find the side length of this square. \n\nThe length of side $BE$ is given as 2, so $\\overline{DE} = \\overline{BE} = 2$. \n\nNow, since $\\overline{AB} = \\overline{BC} = 1$, we have the two sides of a right isosceles triangle $\\triangle ABC$, where the length of hypotenuse $\\overline{AC}$ is found to be $\\sqrt{AB^2+BC^2}= \\sqrt{1^2+1^2}=\\sqrt{2}$ using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nThe length of the diagonal $\\overline{BD}$ is then found as $\\overline{BD}^2 = \\overline{AB}^2 +  \\overline{BC}^2 +  \\overline{DE}^2 +  \\overline{EF}^2=  1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2=  10$ so $\\overline{BD} = \\sqrt{10}.$\n\nNotice that right triangles $\\triangle BDA$ and $\\triangle DFC$ are congruent due to the shared hypotenuse of length $\\sqrt{10}$ and the congruent legs, $\\overline{DA}=\\overline{FC}= \\sqrt{2}$ each.
