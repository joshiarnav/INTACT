  "solution": "Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2.\\]  Solving for $r$ and keeping the positive value yields $r^2=81$, so $r = 9$.  Hence the volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=81\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\pi = \\boxed{972\\pi}.\\]",
