    "To find the set $S,$ we first consider $f(x) = x.$ This is equivalent to the equation\n\n\\[\\frac{x + 6}{x} = x,\\]which simplifies to the quadratic equation\n\n\\[x^2 - x - 6 = (x - 3)(x + 2) = 0.\\]Hence, we have that $x \\in \\{-2, 3\\}$ are the only solutions to $f(x) = x.$ \n\nNow, we are given the definition of the function sequence $(f_n)$ by $f_n = f \\circ f_{n - 1},$ for $n \\ge 2.$ Let's find a pattern by evaluating $f_n(x)$ for a few more positive integers $n.$\n\nFor $n = 3,$\n\\[f_3(x) = f(f_2(x)) = \\frac{13x + 42}{7x + 6}.\\]\nFor $n = 4,$\n$f_4(x) = f(f_3(x)) = \\frac{43x + 294}{13x + 42}$\n\nLet's check whether the values from $f(x) = x$ also satisfy $f_n(x) = x$ for larger $n.$\n\nStarting with $f_2(x),$ \nwe evaluate whether $f(x) = x$ satisfies this equation.\n\\[f_2(x) = \\frac{7x + 6}{x + 6}.\\]\nPlugging in $x = -2,$\nwe have\n\\[f_2(-2) = \\frac{7(-2) + 6}{-2 + 6} = \\frac{-8}{4} = -2.\\]\nSimilarly, plugging in $x = 3,$ \nwe have $f_2(3) = \\frac{1}{1} = 3.$ \nThis means $f_2(x) = x$ for both $x \\in \\{-2, 3\\}.$ \n\nSince we have already shown that $f(x) = x$ only when $x \\in \\{-2, 3\\}$, we claim that $f_n(x) = x$ only when $x \\in \\{-2, 3\\}$ for all positive integers $n.$\n\nNow, let's prove our claim by induction.\n\nBase case: We already know that $f_1(x) = f(x)$ has solutions $\\{-2, 3\\}$ as per the previous calculation, and we have shown that the solutions of $f_n(x) = x$ are also the same as the solutions of $f(x) = x$. Therefore, we can consider $f_2(x)$ as our base case as well, since we've shown it also satisfies our claim.\n\nInductive step: Assume that $f_k(x) = x$ has solutions $\\{-2, 3\\}$. Then we want to prove that $f_{k + 1}(x) = x$ also has solutions $\\{-2, 3\\}$. Now, \n\\[f_{k + 1}(x) = f(f_k(x)) \\]  will have the same solutions as $f_k(x)$. Thus, we are done.\n\nTherefore, by induction, we conclude that the set $S$ of all real numbers $x$ such that $f_n(x) = x$ for some positive integer $n$ is $S = \\boxed{\\{-2, 3\\}}.$\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{2}$",
    "To find the number of elements in $S,$ we need to find the set of all real numbers $x$ such that $f_n(x) = x$ for some positive integer $n.$\n\nFirst, note that if $f_n(x) = x,$ then $f(f_n(x)) = f(x).$  But since $f_n(x) = x,$ we know that\n\\[f(x) = x,\\]which simplifies to\n\\[\\frac{x+6}{x} = x.\\]\nMultiplying both sides by $x$ gives $x + 6 = x^2,$ so\n\n\\[x^2 - x - 6 = (x-3)(x+2) = 0.\\]\nThe solutions to this equation are $x = 3$ and $x = -2,$ so if $x \\in S,$ then $x = 3$ or $x = -2.$\n\nNow, we would like to show that the set of all real numbers $x$ such that $f_n(x) = x$ for some positive integer $n$ is exactly the set $\\{3, -2\\}.$\n\nFirst, we claim that the function $f_n$ can be written as\n\\[f_n(x) = \\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\\]where $a, b, c,$ and $d$ are elements of the set $\\{1, 6, 7\\},$ and the entries of the matrix\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\nform a diagonal of a ``right\" $2\\times 2$ matrix\n\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}\na& b\\\\\n0& d\n\\end{pmatrix}$$of the form we find in the given expression for $f_2(x)$ and $f_3(x)$\n\nto prove this claim, we proceed by induction on $n.$ The base case $n = 1$ is true by definition. For the inductive step, we assume that the statement is true for some particular $n \\ge 1.$ Then we have\n\\[f_n(x) = \\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}.\\]We claim that the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponds to a diagonal of the ``right\" $2\\times2$ matrix \\begin{align} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & d \\end{pmatrix}, \\end{align} of the form we find in the given expression for $f_2(x)$ and $f_3(x)$\nIndeed, since $f(f_n(x)) = f_n(f(x)),$ and the matrices representing $f_n$ and $f_1$ are in the required form, the matrix corresponding to $f_n$ must be\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}\na' & b' \\\\\n0 & d'\n\\end{pmatrix}$$where $(a', d')$ is a diagonal of the matrix $(a, d)$, and similarly, $(b', 0)$ is a diagonal of $(b, c)$.\nThus, by the inductive hypothesis, $f_n(x)$ can be represented as\n$$f_n(x) = \\frac{a'x+b'}{c'x+d'}$$with\n\n$$(a', d') \\text{ a diagonal of } (a, d), \\text{ and } (b', c') \\text{ a diagonal of } (b, c).$$This completes the inductive step.\n\nSince $f_n(3) = 3$ and $f_n(-2) = -2,$ these two values are always fixed points of $f_n.$  Thus, it is clear that the set $S$ is exactly the set $\\{3, -2\\}.$\nHence, $S$ contains exactly 2 elements.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
