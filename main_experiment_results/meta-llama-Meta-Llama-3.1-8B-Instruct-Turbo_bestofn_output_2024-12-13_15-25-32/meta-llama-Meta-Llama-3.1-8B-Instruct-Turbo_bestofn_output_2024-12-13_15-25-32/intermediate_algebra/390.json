    "To find the slant asymptote, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator using long division or synthetic division. \n\nFirst, let's rearrange the expression as follows:\n$y = \\frac{2x^2 + 3x - 7}{x-3} = 2x + ?$\n\nPerforming polynomial long division, we divide $2x^2 + 3x - 7$ by $x - 3$. \n\nHere's the step-by-step division process: \n\n1. Divide $2x^2$ by $x$ to get $2x$. Multiply $x - 3$ by $2x$ to get $2x^2 - 6x$. Subtract this from $2x^2 + 3x - 7$ to get $9x - 7$.\n\n2. Now divide $9x$ by $x$ to get $9$. Multiply $x - 3$ by $9$ to get $9x - 27$. Subtract this from $9x - 7$ to get $20$.\n\nTherefore, we get:\n$2x + 9 + \\frac{20}{x - 3}$\n\nAs $x$ approaches either $\\infty$ or $-\\infty$, the term $\\frac{20}{x - 3}$ approaches zero. \n\nHence, the slant asymptote is the line $y = 2x + 9$.\n\nTo find $m + b$, we add the slope and the y-intercept of this line: $m + b = 2 + 9 = 11$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{11}$.",
    "To find the slant asymptote of the rational expression $y = \\frac{2x^2 + 3x - 7}{x-3}$, we will perform polynomial long division. \n\nStep 1: Divide the numerator by the denominator.\nDivide $2x^2$ by $x$, which gives $2x$. Multiply the denominator by $2x$, i.e., $2x(x) - 12x$. \nNow subtract this result from the numerator $2x^2 + 3x - 7$ which results in $-7x+7$.\n\nStep 2: Now divide the result from the previous step by the denominator.\nDivide $-7x$ by $x$, which gives $-7x$.

    "To find the slant asymptote of a rational expression, we can divide the numerator by the denominator and then simplify.

  "solution": "To approach this problem, we can either use long division or synthetic division to evaluate the quotient of the given rational expression. Alternatively, we can rewrite the numerator as $2x^2 + 3x - 7$ $ = 2x^2 + 3x - 7 - 9x + 9x$ $ = 2x(x-3) + 9x - 7 - 20 + 20$ $ = 2x(x-3) + 9(x-3) + 20$.
