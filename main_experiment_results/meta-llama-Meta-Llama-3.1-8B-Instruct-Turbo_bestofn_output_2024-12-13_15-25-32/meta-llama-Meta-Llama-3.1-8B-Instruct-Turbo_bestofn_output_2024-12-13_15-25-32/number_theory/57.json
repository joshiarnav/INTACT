    "Let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1. When the three integers are divided by 24, the remainders are 10, 4, and 12, respectively. This means the three integers can be represented as: \n   - $24a + 10$\n   - $24b + 4$\n   - $24c + 12$\n\n   where a, b, and c are non-negative integers.\n\n2. Now, if we sum these three integers, we get: \n   - $(24a + 10) + (24b + 4) + (24c + 12)$\n   - $= 24a + 24b + 24c + 26$\n   - $= 24(a + b + c) + 26$\n\n   Notice that the first term has a factor of 24. So, when we divide this term by 24, the remainder will be 0.\n\n3. The remaining part, 26, can be expressed as $24 + 2$, where $24$ is divisible by $24$ and the remainder is $2$.\n\n4. Now, when the entire sum is divided by 24, the remainder will be 0 (from the first term) + the remainder from 26 (which is 2). Therefore, the remainder will be 2.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "To find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24, we need to first understand how remainders work when dealing with division.\n\nWhen a number is divided by another number, it can be represented as:\n\nNumber = Quotient * Divisor + Remainder\n\nWe know that when the three integers are divided by 24, the remainders are 10, 4, and 12, respectively.

    "To solve this problem, let's consider the three integers as $A,$ $B,$ and $C.$ \n\nGiven that when $A$ is divided by $24,$ the remainder is $10.$ \nWe can write $A$ as $A = 24q_1 + 10,$ where $q_1$ is the quotient obtained when $A$ is divided by $24.$\n\nThen, when $B$ is divided by $24,$ the remainder is $4,$ so we can write $B$ as $B = 24q_2 + 4,$ where $q_2$ is the quotient obtained when $B$ is divided by $24.$\n\nSimilarly, when $C$ is divided by $24,$ the remainder is $12,$ so we can write $C$ as $C = 24q_3 + 12,$ where $q_3$ is the quotient obtained when $C$ is divided by $24.$\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24.$ \n\nWe have, \n\\begin{align*}\nA + B + C &= (24q_1 + 10) + (24q_2 + 4) + (24q_3 + 12)\\\\\n&= 24(q_1 + q_2 + q_3) + 26\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, to find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24,$ we need to find the remainder when $26$ is divided by $24.$ \n\n$26$ divided by $24$ leaves a remainder of $2,$ so the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$ is $2.$\n\nTherefore, the remainder is $\\boxed{2}.$"

  "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 10\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 12\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 10+4+12 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $24$.
