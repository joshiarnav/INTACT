    "To find the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime, we need to identify these numbers first.\n\n1. One-digit primes: These are numbers that have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves. The one-digit primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nSince we need the two largest one-digit primes, we choose 5 and 7.\n\n2. Two-digit primes: These are numbers between 10 and 99 that have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves. \n\nThe largest two-digit prime is 97, as it is the largest two-digit number that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nNow, we multiply the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime:\n\n5 (largest one-digit prime) * 7 (second largest one-digit prime) * 97 (largest two-digit prime) \n= 5 * 7 * 97 \n= 35 * 97 \n= 3395\n\nSo, the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime is $\\boxed{3395}$.",
    "To find the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime, we first need to identify these numbers.\n\nThe largest one-digit primes are prime numbers that are less than 10 and greater than 1. These are 7, 5, and 3, because 2, 3, 5, 7 are the one-digit primes; we exclude 2 and 5 for being 2 smallest one-digit primes, leaving the two largest one-digit primes as 7 and 5.\n\nThe largest two-digit prime is the two-digit prime number that is the largest. The two-digit primes are 11, 13, 17, 19, ..., 97; so 97 is the largest two-digit prime.\n\nNow that we have found the two largest one-digit primes (7 and 5) and the largest two-digit prime (97), we can find their product.\n\nProduct = 7 * 5 * 97\nProduct = 3395\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{3395}$.",
    "To find the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime, we need to identify them.\n\nOne-digit primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The two largest among them are 5 and 7.\n\nNext, we need to find the largest two-digit prime. Two-digit primes range from 11 to 97. To find the largest two-digit prime, we can start checking from 97 downwards. \n\nA prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n- 97 is a prime number.\n- 97 is the largest two-digit number, so it is also the largest two-digit prime.\n\nNow, we have the two largest one-digit primes (5 and 7) and the largest two-digit prime (97). We'll multiply them together.\n\nProduct = 5 * 7 * 97\nProduct = 35 * 97\nProduct = 3395\n\nThe product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime is $\\boxed{3395}$."
