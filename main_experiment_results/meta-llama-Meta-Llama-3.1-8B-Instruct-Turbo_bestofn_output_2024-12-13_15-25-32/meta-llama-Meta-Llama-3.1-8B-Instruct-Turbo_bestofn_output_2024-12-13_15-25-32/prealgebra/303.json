    "To solve this problem, we need to find the decimal equivalents of the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ and then sum them up.\n\nStep 1: Find the decimal equivalent of $\\frac{1}{7}$\n\nWe know that $\\frac{1}{7} = 0.142857...$, where the sequence $142857$ repeats indefinitely.\n\nStep 2: Find the decimal equivalent of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n$\\frac{1}{3} = 0.333333...$, where the digit $3$ repeats indefinitely.\n\nStep 3: Sum up the decimal equivalents\n\nNow that we have the decimal equivalents, we can add them up:\n$0.142857... + 0.333333... = 0.476190...$\n\nStep 4: Find the 20th digit after the decimal point\n\nSince we know that the sequence $142857$ has a length of $6$ digits, we can divide $20$ by $6$ to get the number of complete repetitions. \n\n$20 / 6 = 3$ with a remainder of $2$. This means that the sequence $142857$ repeats exactly $3$ times before the 20th digit.\n\nWe need to find the 2nd digit in the sequence $142857$. Since the sequence starts with $1$, the 2nd digit is also $4$.\n\nTherefore, the 20th digit after the decimal point of the sum of the decimal equivalents of $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",

    "To find the 20th digit after the decimal point, we need to calculate the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n1. First, let's find the decimal equivalents of $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n   $\\frac{1}{7} = 0.\\overline{142857}$\n   $\\frac{1}{3} = 0.\\overline{3}$\n\n   $\\because  \\  0.\\overline{142857} + 0.\\overline{3} = 0.476190...$\n2. Next, we need to find the 20th digit after the decimal point. We can do this by noting that the decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{7}$ repeats in blocks of 6 digits, and the decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{3}$ repeats in blocks of 1 digit.\n\n   To find the 20th digit after the decimal point, we need to look at the first 10 blocks of 6 + 1 = 7 digits from $0.\\overline{142857}$ and the 10th block of 1 digit from $0.\\overline{3}$. \n\n   $18$ digits from $\\frac{1}{7}$ have already been calculated. \n\n   $\\because  $\\frac{1}{3}$ \\ will be added on $18$ + $1$ = $19$th place after the block of $\\frac{1}{7}$. Now the 20th digit is to be found. $1$ '3' from $\\frac{1}{3}$ has been added.\n   \n   $\\therefore 3$ from $\\frac{1}{3}$ is the 20th digit after the decimal point.\n\nSo, the 20th digit after the decimal point of the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $\\boxed{3}$."

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, let's evaluate each solution for accuracy and clarity.\n\nSolution 1 is accurate and straightforward, but it could be more concise.\n\nSolution 2 is also accurate but contains some minor errors in the notation and explanation.\n\nSolution 3 is accurate and clear but might be a bit confusing due to the way it breaks down the blocks of digits.\n\nHowever, Solution 3 is the most accurate in its explanation and calculation of the 20th digit.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 3.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is 3.",
  "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$, and that of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $0.\\overline{3}$. The first has a repeating block of 6 digits and the second has a repeating block of 1 digit, so we believe the repeating block of the sum will have 6 digits and try adding the first 6 digits of each decimal representation.  $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}& & &. &1 & 4 & \\stackrel{1}{2} & 8 & \\stackrel{1}{5} & 7\\\\& +& &. &3 &3 & 3 & 3& 3 & 3\\\\ \\cline{1-9} & & & .& 4 &7 & 6 & 1 & 9 & 0\\\\ \\end{array} $$ Notice that continuing the addition past the first six digits will result in repeating blocks of the same six digits ($.142857+.333333=.476190$), so the decimal representation of the sum is $0.\\overline{476190}$. Since 20 divided by 6 has a remainder of 2, the 20th digit following the decimal point is the same as the second digit following the decimal point, which is $\\boxed{7}$.",
