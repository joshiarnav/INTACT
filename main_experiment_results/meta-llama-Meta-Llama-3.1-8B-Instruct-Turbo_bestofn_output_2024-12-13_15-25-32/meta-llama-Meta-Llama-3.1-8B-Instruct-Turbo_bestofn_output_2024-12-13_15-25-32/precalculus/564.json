    "To find the image of $2i$ under the dilation, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the center of dilation**: The center of dilation is given as $-1 + 4i.$\n2. **Identify the scale factor**: The scale factor is given as $-2.$\n3. **Find the vector from the center to the original point**: The vector from the center to the original point $2i$ is $(2i - (-1 + 4i)) = (1 - 2i).$\n4. **Scale the vector**: To scale the vector by a factor of $-2$, we multiply the vector by $-2$: $-2(1 - 2i) = -2 + 4i.$\n5. **Translate the scaled vector**: The scaled vector $-2 + 4i$ is translated to its final position by adding the center of dilation $-1 + 4i$: $(-2 + 4i) + (-1 + 4i) = -3 + 8i.$\n\nTherefore, the image of $2i$ under the dilation is $\\boxed{-3 + 8i}$.",
