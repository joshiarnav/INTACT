    "To find the greatest integer $n$ such that $n^2 - 11n +24 \\leq 0$, we need to solve the quadratic inequality.\n\nStep 1: Factorize the quadratic expression.\n\n$n^2 - 11n + 24 = (n-8)(n-3) \\leq 0$\n\nStep 2: Determine the critical points by setting each factor equal to zero and solving for $n$.\n\n$n-8 = 0 \\Rightarrow n = 8$\n\n$n-3 = 0 \\Rightarrow n = 3$\n\nSo, the critical points are $n = 3$ and $n = 8$.\n\nStep 3: Create a sign chart for the quadratic inequality.\n\n| Interval     | $(n-8)$ | $(n-3)$ | $(n^2 - 11n + 24)$ |\n|-------------|---------|---------|--------------------|\n| $(-\\infty, 3)$ | -      | -      | +                  |\n| $[3, 8]$    | -      | +      | -                  |\n| $[8, \\infty)$ | +      | +      | -                  |\n\nFrom the sign chart, we can see that the quadratic inequality is nonpositive in the interval $[3, 8]$.\n\nStep 4: The largest integer $n$ that satisfies the inequality is $8$. However, we need to consider whether it satisfies the inequality or not. Since  $8^2 - 11*8 +24 = 64 - 88 +24 = 0$, thus $8$ is included in the solution.\n\nTherefore, the greatest integer $n$ such that $n^2 - 11n +24 \\leq 0$ is $\\boxed{8}$.",

  "solution": "We can factor $n^2-11n+24$ as $(n-3)(n-8)$. For this quantity to be less than or equal to 0, one of the factors must be less than or equal to 0 and the other factor must be greater than or equal to 0. Specifically, since $n-8<n-3$ for all $n$, we must have $$n-8 \\le 0 \\le n-3.$$ The first inequality, $n-8\\le 0$, tells us that $n\\le 8$. The second inequality, $0\\le n-3$, tells us that $n\\ge 3$. The solutions to the original inequality must satisfy both conditions, so they are given by $3\\le n\\le 8$. The largest integer in this interval is $n=\\boxed{8}$.",
