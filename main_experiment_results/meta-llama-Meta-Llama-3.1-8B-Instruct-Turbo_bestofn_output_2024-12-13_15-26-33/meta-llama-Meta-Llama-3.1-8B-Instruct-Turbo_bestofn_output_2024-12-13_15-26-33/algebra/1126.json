    "To find the vertical asymptote, we need to find the value of x that makes the denominator (5x - 7) equal to zero, since a function has a vertical asymptote at a point where the denominator is zero and the numerator is not.\n\nStep 1: Set the denominator (5x - 7) equal to zero:\n\n5x - 7 = 0\n\nStep 2: Solve for x:\n\n5x = 7\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nx = 7/5\n\nStep 3: Check if the numerator (x + 2) is not equal to zero at this value of x. We plug in x = 7/5 into the numerator:\n\n(x + 2) = (7/5 + 2)\n\nSince the numerator is not zero, x = 7/5 is the x-value where the function has a vertical asymptote.\n\nSo, the x-value where the vertical asymptote is located is: $\\boxed{7/5}$.",
    "To find the vertical asymptote, we need to find the value of $x$ that makes the denominator of the fraction equal to zero. \n\nThe equation is $y=\\frac{x+2}{5x-7}$.\n\nThe denominator is $5x-7$. \n\nTo find the value of $x$ that makes the denominator equal to zero, we can set the denominator equal to zero and solve for $x$:\n\n$5x - 7 = 0$\n\nAdd $7$ to both sides:\n\n$5x = 7$\n\nDivide both sides by $5$:\n\n$x = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\nTherefore, there is a vertical asymptote at $x = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{5}}$.",

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 1. \n\nSolution 1 is the best solution because it explicitly checks if the numerator is not equal to zero at the value of x where the denominator is zero. This is a crucial step to ensure that the value of x is indeed a vertical asymptote, and not a hole in the graph. \n\nThe other two solutions assume that the value of x is a vertical asymptote without explicitly checking if the numerator is not equal to zero. \n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "There is a vertical asymptote where the denominator equals 0 and thus $y$ is undefined. For the denominator to equal 0, we have $5x-7=0\\Rightarrow x=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{5}}$.",
