    "To solve this problem, let's denote the distance of each day as follows: \n\nDay 1: $a$\nDay 2: $b$\nDay 3: $c$\nDay 4: $d$\n\nWe know the following information:\n1. $a + b = 22$\n2. $\\frac{b + c}{2} = 13$\n3. $c + d = 30$\n4. $a + c = 26$\n\nFrom equation (2), we can multiply both sides by 2 to get:\n$2b + 2c = 26$\n\nFrom equation (1), we know $a + b = 22$, and we can rearrange it to get $b = 22 - a$. \n\nSubstitute $b = 22 - a$ into the above equation:\n$2(22 - a) + 2c = 26$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n$44 - 2a + 2c = 26$\n\n$2c - 2a = -18$\n\n$c - a = -9$\n\nWe also know from equation (4) that $a + c = 26$.\n\nNow, we can solve these two equations:\n$c - a = -9$\n$a + c = 26$\n\nAdd both equations together to eliminate 'a':\n$2c = 17$\n\n$c = 8.5$\n\nNow, substitute $c = 8.5$ into equation $a + c = 26$ to find the value of 'a':\n$a + 8.5 = 26$\n\n$a = 17.5$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $a = 17.5$ into equation $a + b = 22$ to find the value of 'b':\n$17.5 + b = 22$\n\n$b = 4.5$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $c = 8.5$ into equation $c + d = 30$ to find the value of 'd':\n$8.5 + d = 30$\n\n$d = 21.5$\n\nNow, we can calculate the total distance of the hike:\n$a + b + c + d = 17.5 + 4.5 + 8.5 + 21.5$\n\nTotal distance = $\\boxed{52}$",
