    "To find the value of $x^5 - 5x$ when $x = 4$, we'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS).\n\n1. Calculate the value of $x$ when $x = 4$ and is in the expression $x^5$. Here we substitute $4$ for $x$, so $4^5$ equals $1024$.\n2. Now calculate the value of $5x$, here $5 * 4 = 20$.\n3. Subtract $5x$ from $x^5$, which is $1024 - 20 = 1004$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $x^5 - 5x$ when $x = 4$ is $\\boxed{1004}$.",
