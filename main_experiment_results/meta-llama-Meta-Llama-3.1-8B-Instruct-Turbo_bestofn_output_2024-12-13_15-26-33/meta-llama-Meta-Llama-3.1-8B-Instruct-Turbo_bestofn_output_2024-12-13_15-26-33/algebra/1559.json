    "To find the value of q, let's analyze the given equation and express both sides with the same base.\n\n$27^8 = 9^q$\n\nExpress 27 and 9 with the base 3:\n$27 = 3^3$\n$9 = 3^2$\n\nNow, rewrite the equation using these expressions:\n$(3^3)^8 = (3^2)^q$\n\nApplying the power of a power rule to the left side:\n$3^{3*8} = 3^{2q}$\n\n$3^{24} = 3^{2q}$\n\nSince the bases are the same, equate the exponents:\n$24 = 2q$\n\nDivide both sides by 2 to solve for q:\n$q = \\boxed{12}$",
    "We can start solving this problem by expressing both 27 and 9 in terms of a base that is related to both numbers. \n\nWe can observe that 27 is $3^3$ and 9 is $3^2$. \n\nNow, let's rewrite the equation with these new expressions:\n\n$(3^3)^8=(3^2)^q$\n\nSimplifying the exponents using the power rule of exponents ($a^{mn}=(a^m)^n$), we get:\n\n$3^{24}=3^{2q}$\n\nSince the bases are equal, we can set the exponents equal to each other, resulting in:\n\n$24=2q$\n\nNow, let's solve for $q$ by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n$q=24/2$\n\n$q=12$\n\nSo, the value of $q$ is 12, and our final answer would be:\n\n$\\boxed{12}$",
    "To solve for q, we can take the logarithm of both sides of the equation with base 3, since 27 and 9 are both powers of 3. \n\nWe know that 27 = 3^3 and 9 = 3^2. \n\nAlso, we can rewrite the equation as (3^3)^8 = (3^2)^q. \n\nThis simplifies to 3^(24) = 3^(2q).\n\nSince the bases are equal, we can equate the exponents:\n\n24 = 2q\n\nNow, we can solve for q:\n\nq = 24 / 2\n\nq = 12\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$."
