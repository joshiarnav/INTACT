    "To find the sum of 1 to 49, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \n\nSum = (n * (first term + last term)) / 2\n\nIn this case, the first term is 1 and the last term is 49. The number of terms (n) is also 49, since there are 49 terms in the series.\n\nNow, let's plug in the values into the formula: \n\nSum = (49 * (1 + 49)) / 2\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum inside the parentheses: \n1 + 49 = 50\n\nNow, the formula becomes:\nSum = (49 * 50) / 2\n\nNow, let's calculate the multiplication: \n49 * 50 = 2450\n\nNow, the formula becomes:\nSum = 2450 / 2\n\nFinally, let's calculate the division: \n2450 / 2 = 1225\n\nSo the sum of 1 to 49 is: \n$\\boxed{1225}$",
    "To find the sum, let's use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \n\nSum = n(n + 1)/2 \n\nwhere n is the number of terms in the series. In this case, the number of terms is 49 (from 1 to 49).\n\nNow, let's plug in the value of n into the formula.\n\nSum = 49(49 + 1)/2 \nSum = 49(50)/2 \nSum = 2450/2 \nSum = 1225 \n\nSo, the sum is $\\boxed{1225}$.",
    "To find the sum of the series $1+2+3+4+\\dots +48+49$, we can use a simple arithmetic formula. \n\nFirst, let's recognize that this is an arithmetic series, and the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:\n\nS = (n/2) * (first term + last term)\n\nwhere S is the sum, n is the number of terms, and first term and last term are the first and last numbers of the series, respectively.\n\nIn this case, the first term is 1, and the last term is 49. \n\nTo find the number of terms (n), we can use a formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \n\na_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \n\nwhere a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, n is the number of terms, and d is the common difference between terms. The common difference in this case is 1.\n\nRearrange this formula to solve for n: \nn = (a_n - a_1)/d + 1 \n\nNow substitute a_n = 49, a_1 = 1, and d = 1 into the equation: \nn = (49 - 1)/1 + 1 \nn = 48 + 1 \nn = 49 \n\nNow that we know the number of terms is 49 (which we had suspected), we can use the formula S = (n/2) * (first term + last term) to find the sum.\n\nSubstitute n = 49, first term = 1, and last term = 49 into the equation: \nS = (49/2) * (1 + 49) \nS = (49/2) * 50 \nS = 49 * 25 \nS = 1225\n\nSo the sum of the series $1+2+3+4+\\dots +48+49$ is $\\boxed{1225}$."

  "critique": "After analyzing the three solutions, I would say that Solution 2 is the best solution. \n\nHere's why:\n\n- Solution 1 and Solution 3 both use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, but they both use a more complicated approach to calculate the sum.\n- Solution 2, on the other hand, uses the simplified formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: Sum = n(n + 1)/2. This formula is more straightforward and easier to apply.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2.\n\nSo, the index number of the best solution is: 2",
  "solution": "For all $n$, $1 + 2 + \\dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so $1 + 2 + \\dots + 49 = 49 \\cdot 50/2 = \\boxed{1225}$.",
