    "To find the area of the triangular region, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the x and y intercepts of the line $2x + y = 6$ to determine the vertices of the triangle.\n\n- To find the x-intercept, let $y = 0$ in the equation $2x + y = 6$. This gives us $2x + 0 = 6$. Solving for x, we get $2x = 6$ and $x = 3$. So, the x-intercept is (3, 0).\n\n- To find the y-intercept, let $x = 0$ in the equation $2x + y = 6$. This gives us $2(0) + y = 6$. Solving for y, we get $y = 6$. So, the y-intercept is (0, 6).\n\n2. The vertices of the triangle are now known to be (0, 0), (3, 0), and (0, 6).\n\n3. Use the formula for the area of a triangle: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times base \\times height$\n\n- The base of the triangle is the distance between (0, 0) and (3, 0), which is 3 units.\n\n- The height of the triangle is the distance between (0, 0) and (0, 6), which is 6 units.\n\n4. Plug in the values into the formula to find the area: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 6 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 18 = 9$ square units.\n\nThe area of the triangular region is $\\boxed{9}$.",

  "solution": "To start, use the equation to solve for the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the line.  Letting $x$ equal 0, the $y$-intercept is 6.  Letting $y$ equal 0, we find that $2x=6$ so the $x$-intercept is 3.  Using the intercepts, we can graph the line as shown: [asy]size(100,0);\nfill((0,0)--(0,6)--(3,0)--cycle,gray(.7));\nadd(grid(5,8));\ndraw((0,0)--(5,0),linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,8),linewidth(2));\nlabel(\"\",(5,0),E);\nlabel(\"\",(0,8),N);\ndraw((0,6)--(3,0),blue,Arrows);[/asy] We wish to find the area of the shaded region.
