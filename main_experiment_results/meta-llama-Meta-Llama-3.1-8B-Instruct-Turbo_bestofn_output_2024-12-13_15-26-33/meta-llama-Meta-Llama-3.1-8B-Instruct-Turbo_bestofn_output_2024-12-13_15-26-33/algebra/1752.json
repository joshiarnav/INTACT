    "To find the value of $b$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the midpoint of the line segment**: The line segment is from $(2,5)$ to $(4,9)$. To find the midpoint, we need to average the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the endpoints.\n\n   Midpoint = $\\left(\\frac{(2+4)}{2}, \\frac{(5+9)}{2}\\right)$\n   Midpoint = $\\left(\\frac{6}{2}, \\frac{14}{2}\\right)$\n   Midpoint = $(3,7)$\n\n2. **Since the line $x+y=b$ intersects the line segment at its midpoint, we can substitute the x and y values of the midpoint into the line equation**: \n\n   $x + y = b$\n   $3 + 7 = b$\n   $10 = b$\n\nTherefore, the value of $b$ is $\\boxed{10}$.",
