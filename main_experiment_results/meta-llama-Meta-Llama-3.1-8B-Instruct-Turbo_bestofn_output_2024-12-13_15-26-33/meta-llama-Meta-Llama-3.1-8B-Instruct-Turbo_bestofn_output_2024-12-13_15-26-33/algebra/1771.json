    "To find the points where the two parabolas intersect, we need to set their equations equal to each other and solve for x.\n\nThe equations are:\n$y=2x^2-7x+1$ and $y=8x^2+5x+1$\n\nSetting them equal to each other:\n$2x^2-7x+1 = 8x^2+5x+1$\n\nSubtracting $2x^2-7x+1$ from both sides:\n$0 = 6x^2+12x$\n\nDividing both sides by 6:\n$0 = x^2+2x$\n\nFactoring the equation:\n$0 = x(x+2)$\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n$x = 0$ or $x+2 = 0$, which means $x=-2$\n\nNow, we substitute these values of x into one of the original equations to find the corresponding y-values. We'll use the first equation $y=2x^2-7x+1$:\n\nFor $x = 0$:\n$y = 2(0)^2 - 7(0) + 1 = 1$\n\nFor $x = -2$:\n$y = 2(-2)^2 - 7(-2) + 1 = 8 + 14 + 1 = 23$\n\nSo, the two points of intersection are $(0,1)$ and $(-2, 23)$. However, the task requests that we list points in order of increasing $x$-coordinate.\n\nThus, the answer in the required format is $\\boxed{(-2, 23); (0,1)}$",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and provide the same answer: $\\boxed{(-2, 23); (0, 1)}$. However, I will evaluate each solution based on clarity, organization, and adherence to the problem-solving process.\n\nSolution 1 is clear and well-organized, but it could benefit from more intermediate steps and explanations.\n\nSolution 2 is very similar to Solution 1, but it has a minor mistake in the factoring step. However, the mistake is quickly corrected, and the solution is still clear and well-organized.\n\nSolution 3 is also clear and well-organized. It uses a slightly different approach by factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF) from the quadratic expression. This approach can be beneficial for some students, as it highlights the importance of factoring in solving quadratic equations.\n\nBased on clarity, organization, and adherence to the problem-solving process, I would rate Solution 3 as the best solution. Therefore, the index number is:\n\n1. Solution 1\n2. Solution 2\n3. Solution 3\n\nSo, the best solution is Solution 3.",
  "solution": "First, set the two equations equal to each other to get $2x^2-7x+1=8x^2+5x+1$. Combine like terms to get $6x^2+12x=0$. Then, we can divide by $6$ to get $x^2+2x=0$. To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{2}\\right)^2=1$ to both sides, giving $(x+1)^2=1$.\n\nSo we have $x+1=\\pm1$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x=-2$ or $0$. Using these in our original parabolas, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-2, 23)}$ and $\\boxed{(0, 1)}$.",
