    "To find $\\lfloor |-4.2| \\rfloor + |\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor|$, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. $|-4.2|$ is the absolute value of $-4.2$, which is 4.2.\n\n2. $\\lfloor 4.2 \\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to 4.2, which is 4.\n\n3. $|\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor|$ involves first finding $\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor$. The greatest integer less than or equal to -4.2 is -5.\n\n4.

    "To find $\\lfloor |-4.2| \\rfloor + |\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor|$, we need to break it down step by step.\n\n1. First, let's find the absolute value of $-4.2$, which is $|-4.2| = 4.2$.\n\n2. Then, we take the floor of $4.2$, which is the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $4.2$. This is $\\lfloor 4.2 \\rfloor = 4$.\n\n3. Now, let's find the floor of $-4.2$, which is the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $-4.2$. This is $\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor = -5$.\n\n4. Finally, we take the absolute value of $-5$, which is $|\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor| = 5$.\n\n5.

    "To solve the given expression, we'll break it down into smaller steps.\n\n1. We need to find $|-4.2|$. This is the absolute value of -4.2, which is calculated by removing the negative sign. So, $|-4.2| = 4.2$.\n\n2. Next, we find $\\lfloor 4.2 \\rfloor$. The symbol $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ represents the greatest integer less than or equal to x. In this case, the greatest integer less than 4.2 is 4. So, $\\lfloor 4.2 \\rfloor = 4$.\n\n3. Then, we need to find $|\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor|$. First, we find $\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor$. The greatest integer less than -4.2 is -5, so $\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor = -5$. Now, we take the absolute value of -5, which is 5. So, $|\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor| = 5$.\n\n4. Finally, we add the two values we found: $\\lfloor |-4.2| \\rfloor + |\\lfloor -4.2 \\rfloor| = 4 + 5 = 9$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{9}$."
