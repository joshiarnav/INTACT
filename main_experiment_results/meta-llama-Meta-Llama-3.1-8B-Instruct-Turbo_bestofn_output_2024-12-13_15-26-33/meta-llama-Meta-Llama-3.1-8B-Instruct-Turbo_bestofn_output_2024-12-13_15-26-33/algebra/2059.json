    "To find the value of $\\log_{10}{17}$ between the consecutive integers $a$ and $b$, we need to compare the logarithm to some known values of $10^x$. \n\nSince we know that $10^1=10$ and $10^2=100$, we can say that $\\log_{10}10=1$ and $\\log_{10}100=2$.\n\nGiven this, we can infer that any number between $10$ and $100$ will have a logarithm greater than $1$ but less than $2$, because raising $10$ to the power of a number between $1$ and $2$ will yield a number between $10$ and $100$.\n\nThus, the value of $\\log_{10}{17}$ is between the consecutive integers $1$ and $2$. \n\nTherefore, $a=1$ and $b=2$, and $a+b=\\boxed{3}$.",
    "To find the value of $\\log_{10}{17}$ between consecutive integers, we first need to understand what logarithms represent. The logarithm $\\log_{10}{x}$ represents the power to which 10 must be raised to get $x$. \n\nWe know that $\\log_{10}10=1$ and $\\log_{10}100=2$ since $10^1=10$ and $10^2=100$. \n\nWe also know that $10^1<17<10^2$ because $10<17<100$. \n\nSo we have the inequality $\\log_{10}10<\\log_{10}17<\\log_{10}100$. \n\nSince $\\log_{10}10=1$ and $\\log_{10}100=2$, we can simplify the inequality to $1<\\log_{10}17<2$. \n\nThe integers between which we need to find $\\log_{10}17$ are 1 and 2. Therefore, $a=1$ and $b=2$, and $a+b=1+2=\\boxed{3}$."

  "critique": "Both solutions are correct. However, the first solution is slightly more concise and easier to read. Therefore, I would rate the first solution as the best solution.\n\nSo, the index number of the best solution is 1.",
  "solution": "We can have $\\log_{10}10=1$ and $\\log_{10}100=2$.  Since $\\log_{10}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\\log_{10}10<\\log_{10}17<\\log_{10}100$, meaning $1<\\log_{10}17<2$.  Thus, the desired sum is $1+2=\\boxed{3}$.",
