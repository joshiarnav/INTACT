    "To find the inverse of the function $f(x)=4-5x$, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Replace $f(x)$ with $y$: $y = 4 - 5x$.\n2. Switch $x$ and $y$: $x = 4 - 5y$.\n3. Solve for $y$: This step will involve isolating $y$. We'll start by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation to get: \n   - $x - 4 = -5y$.\n\n4. Divide both sides by $-5$ to solve for $y$: \n   - $\\frac{x - 4}{-5} = y$.\n\n   We simplify the left side to get: \n   - $\\frac{4 - x}{5} = y$.\n\n5. The inverse function is $f^{-1}(x)$, so we have: \n   - $f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{4-x}{5}$.\n\nTherefore, the inverse of $f(x)=4-5x$ is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4-x}{5}}$.",

  "solution": "If we let $g(x)$ denote the inverse to $f$ then we can evaluate $f$ at $g(x)$ to get  \\[f(g(x))=4-5g(x).\\]Since $g$ is the inverse to $f$, the left side is $x$ and  \\[x=4-5g(x).\\]Solving for $g(x)$, we find $g(x) = \\boxed{\\frac{4-x}{5}}$.",
