    "To find the smallest positive value of m so that the given quadratic equation has integral solutions, we can start by recalling the properties of a quadratic equation.\n\nThe general form of a quadratic equation is ax^2 + bx + c = 0, and for this equation to have integral solutions, the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) must be a perfect square.\n\nIn the given equation, 10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0, a = 10, b = -m, and c = 420.\n\nSo, the discriminant is (-m)^2 - 4(10)(420) = m^2 - 16800.\n\nFor the discriminant to be a perfect square, let's assume m^2 - 16800 = n^2, where n is an integer.\n\nRearranging this equation, we get m^2 = n^2 + 16800.\n\nWe can write this as (m+n)(m-n) = 16800.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest possible value of m such that (m+n)(m-n) = 16800 and both m+n and m-n are positive integers.\n\nTo minimize m, we should look for pairs of factors of 16800 that are as close together as possible.\n\nThe prime factorization of 16800 is:\n\n2^6 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 7\n\nUsing this prime factorization, we can find the factors of 16800 that are closest together.\n\nThe factors of 16800 that are closest together are (100, 168), (140, 120), and (168, 100). But the closest pair should be to each other with the factors 140 and 120.\n\nTherefore, m+n = 140 and m-n = 120.\n\nAdding the two equations, we get 2m = 260, or m = 130.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive value of m is 130.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{130}$.",
    "To find the smallest positive value of $m$ for which the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ has integral solutions, let's first consider the properties of quadratic equations and their roots.\n\nFor a quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots ($r_1$ and $r_2$) is given by $r_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{b}{a}$ and the product of the roots is given by $r_1 \\cdot r_2 = \\frac{c}{a}$.\n\nApplying these properties to the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$, we have:\n\n- The sum of the roots: $r_1 + r_2 = \\frac{m}{10}$\n- The product of the roots: $r_1 \\cdot r_2 = \\frac{420}{10} = 42$\n\nSince we're dealing with integral solutions, both roots must be integers.

  "solution": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the solutions the the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$. We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively, so $p+q = m/10$ and $pq = 420/10 = 42$. Since $m = 10(p+q)$, we minimize $m$ by minimizing the sum $p+q$. Since $p$ and $q$ are integers and multiply to 42, the possible values of $(p,q)$ are $(1,42),(2,21),(3,14),(6,7),(7,6),(14,3),(21,2),(42,1)$. (Note that if $p$ and $q$ are both negative, then $p+q$ is negative, so $m$ would be negative, which is excluded by the problem.) The sum $p+q$ is minimized when $(p,q) = (6,7)$ or $(7,6)$. In either case, $m = 10(p+q) = 10(6+7) = \\boxed{130}.$",
