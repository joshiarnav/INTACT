    "To solve this problem, let's denote the integer as 'x'. \n\nWe know that the square of the integer is 'x^2' and its double is '2x'. According to the given problem, 'x^2' is 48 more than '2x', so we can write the equation as:\n\nx^2 = 2x + 48\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation in standard form:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 48 = 0\n\nTo find the roots of this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula, but let's try factoring first. \n\nFactoring:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 48 = (x - 8)(x + 6) = 0\n\nSince we want the least integer, we consider the negative solution for the equation because a negative integer is smaller than any positive integer. So, the least integer 'x' is -6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{-6}$",
    "To find the least integer satisfying the condition, we need to translate the problem into a mathematical equation. Let's assume the integer is represented by 'x'.\n\nThe problem states that the square of the integer is 48 more than its double. This can be written as:\n\nx^2 = 2x + 48\n\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 48 = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation for 'x'.\n\nWe can factor the quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula. \n\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 8)(x + 6) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible values for 'x': x - 8 = 0 or x + 6 = 0\n\nSolving these equations:\n\nx - 8 = 0 => x = 8\n\nx + 6 = 0 => x = -6\n\nSince we are looking for the least integer, x = -6 is the least integer among the two solutions.\n\nTherefore, the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double is $\\boxed{-6}$.",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and arrive at the same answer, which is -6. \n\nHowever, in terms of clarity and detail, Solution 1 is slightly more detailed in its explanation of the steps taken to solve the equation. \n\nTherefore, the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "From the information given, we have $x^2 = 2x + 48$. Rearranging, we get $x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$, which we can factor as $(x+6)(x-8) = 0$. Therefore, $x = -6\\text{ or }8$.  Since we want the lesser, $\\boxed{-6}$ is our answer.",
