    "To rationalize the denominator, we need to simplify the expression. \n\nFirst, let's break down $\\sqrt[3]{16}$: \n\n$\\sqrt[3]{16} = \\sqrt[3]{2^3 \\cdot 2} = 2\\sqrt[3]{2}$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the original expression: \n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2} + 2\\sqrt[3]{2}} = \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{2}}$$\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt[3]{4}$, which is the cube root of the product of the two cubes: \n\n$$\\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{\\sqrt[3]{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{3\\sqrt[3]{8}}$$\n\nSimplify the denominator by combining the two cube roots: \n\n$$\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{3\\sqrt[3]{8}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{3 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{6}$$\n\nThen we simplify the radical to finally get the answer in the required boxed format:\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{6}}$",
    "To rationalize the denominator, we need to get rid of the cube roots.

    "To rationalize the denominator, we first simplify the expression by finding a common term for $\\sqrt[3]{16}$. \n\nSince $\\sqrt[3]{16} = \\sqrt[3]{2^3\\cdot2}$, we can write this as $\\sqrt[3]{2} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{2^2} = \\sqrt[3]{2} \\cdot 2^{2/3}$.\n\nThus, our expression becomes: \n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}+\\sqrt[3]{16}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}+2^{2/3}\\sqrt[3]{2}} = \\frac{1}{2^{1/3}\\left(1+2^{1/3}\\right)}$$.\n\nNext, to rationalize the denominator, we can use the method of multiplying by a conjugate. The conjugate of $2^{1/3}\\left(1+2^{1/3}\\right)$ is $2^{1/3}\\left(1+2^{1/3}\\right)$. However, multiplying by a conjugate is typically used when dealing with square roots. \n\nInstead, we can factor the 2 cube root out. The denominator can be rewritten:\n\n$$2^{1/3}\\left(1+2^{1/3}\\right) = \\sqrt[3]{2}\\left(\\sqrt[3]{1}+\\sqrt[3]{8}\\right) = \\sqrt[3]{2}\\left(1+2^{2/3}\\right) = \\sqrt[3]{2}\\left(1+\\sqrt[3]{2^2}\\right)$$\n\nTo rationalize, we will multiply the top and the bottom by the conjugate of the denominator. \n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}+\\sqrt[3]{16}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}+2^{2/3}\\sqrt[3]{2}} = \\frac{1}{2^{1/3}\\left(1+2^{1/3}\\right)}$$. \n\nWe are going now as before and thus we're going to multiply by the conjugate of the 2 cube root times left parenthesis, one plus 2 to the 2/3 end root, right parenthesis. Which is: \n2 to the 1/3 times left parenthesis, one plus 2 to the 1/3 end root, right parenthesis. \n\nSo the  final answer is \n$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2^{1/3}\\left(1+2^{1/3}\\right)} \\times \\frac{2^{1/3}\\left(1+2^{1/3}\\right)}{2^{1/3}\\left(1+2^{1/3}\\right)}}$"

  "solution": "First, simplify $\\sqrt[3]{16}=\\sqrt[3]{2^3\\cdot2}=2\\sqrt[3]{2}$.  Substituting this, the fraction becomes: $$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}+2\\sqrt[3]{2}}=\\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{2}}$$ To rationalize this, we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by something that will eliminate the cube root in the denominator.  If we multiply $\\sqrt[3]{2}$, by $\\sqrt[3]{4}$, then the result will be $\\sqrt[3]{2}\\cdot\\sqrt[3]{4}=\\sqrt[3]{2\\cdot4}=\\sqrt[3]{8}=2$.  So, multiply the expression above by $\\dfrac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}$. $$\\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}=\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{3\\sqrt[3]{8}}=\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}}{6}}$$",
