  "problem": "Joann rode her bike at an average speed of 12 miles per hour for three and a half hours. If her friend, Fran, rides for 3 hours, at what average speed, in miles per hour, would she have to ride her bike to travel the same distance that Joann traveled?",
  "all_solutions": [
    "To find the distance that Joann traveled, we need to multiply her average speed by the time she rode her bike. \n\nDistance = speed * time\nDistance = 12 miles/hour * 3.5 hours\nDistance = 42 miles\n\nNow, we know that Fran also wants to travel the same distance. To find the speed at which she needs to ride her bike to achieve the same distance in 3 hours, we can rearrange the formula for distance. \n\nSpeed = distance / time\n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:\n\nSpeed = 42 miles / 3 hours\nSpeed = 14 miles/hour\n\nSo, Fran needs to ride her bike at an average speed of 14 miles per hour to travel the same distance that Joann traveled.\n\n$\\boxed{14}$",
    "To solve this problem, we need to find the distance that Joann traveled and then determine the speed Fran needs to travel to cover the same distance in 3 hours.\n\nStep 1: Find the distance Joann traveled. We can use the formula: \n\nDistance = Speed * Time\n\nJoann's speed = 12 miles/hour\nJoann's time = 3.5 hours\n\nDistance = Speed * Time\nDistance = 12 * 3.5\nDistance = 42 miles\n\nStep 2: Determine the speed Fran needs to ride to cover the same distance (42 miles) in 3 hours. We can use the same formula:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nFran's time = 3 hours\nDistance = 42 miles\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nSpeed = 42 / 3\nSpeed = 14 miles/hour\n\nTherefore, the average speed at which Fran needs to ride her bike is $\\boxed{14}$ miles per hour."
