    "To find the value of $p - q$, let's first solve for the two distinct solutions to the equation.\n\nGiven: \n$\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15}=x+2$\n\nStep 1: \nFactorize the denominator by finding two numbers that multiply to $-15$ and add up to $2$. Those numbers are $5$ and $-3$. \nThe equation becomes: \n$\\frac{4x-12}{(x+3)(x-5)}=x+2$\n\nStep 2: \nSimplify the numerator by factoring out $4$. \n$\\frac{4(x-3)}{(x+3)(x-5)}=x+2$\n\nStep 3: \nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by $(x + 3)(x - 5)$. \n$4(x-3) = (x + 2)(x + 3)(x - 5)$ \n\nStep 4: \nExpand both sides of the equation.\n$4x - 12 = (x^2 + 5x - 15)(x + 2)$\n$4x - 12 = (x^3 - 3x^2 - 5x + 6)$\n\nStep 5: \nSimplify the right side of the equation by combining like terms.\nThe left side is already simplified.\n\nStep 6: \nGroup terms by powers of $x$.\nSimplify the equation by removing the brackets.\nThe left side is $4x - 12$ and the right side is:\n$x^3 + x^2 - 5x + 6$\n\nStep 7: \nRearrange the equation into a polynomial equation in descending powers of $x$. \n$x^3 + x^2 - 5x+ 6 - 4x + 12 = 0$\n\nStep 8: \nCombine like terms. \n$x^3 + x^2 - 9x + 18 = 0$\n\nStep 9: \nFactorize the polynomial equation. \n$(x- 3)(x^2 + 4x - 6) = 0$\n\nStep 10: \nFactorize further using a number that when multiplied by $-6$ gives $4$ times the number. That number is $3$.\n$(x- 3)(x^2 + 4x + 6 - 12) = 0$\n$(x- 3)(x + 3)(x - 2) = 0$\n\nStep 11: \nSolve the equation using the zero product property.\n$(x - 3) = 0$ or $(x + 3) = 0$ or $(x - 2) = 0$. So $x = 3$, $x = -3$, and $x= 2$.\nWe know that $p > q$, so let $p=3$ and $q=-3$, as they both satisfy the original equation and $p > q$.\n\nStep 12: \nSubtract the value of $q$ from $p$ to find the answer.\n$p - q = 3 - (-3) = 6$\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",

    "To solve this problem, we will follow the given steps. \n\n1. Start with the equation: $\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15}=x+2.$\n\n2. Factor the denominator: The denominator can be factored into $(x-3)(x+5)$.\n\n3. Now the equation looks like this: $\\frac{4x-12}{(x-3)(x+5)}=x+2.$\n\n4. To simplify it, multiply both sides by $(x-3)(x+5)$. This results in $4x - 12 = (x+2)(x^2+2x-15)$. \n\n5. Expand the right side of the equation: $4x - 12 = x^3 + 2x^2 - 15x + 2x^2 + 4x - 30$. \n\n6. Combine like terms: $4x - 12 = x^3 + 4x^2 - 11x - 30$. \n\n7. Move all terms to one side of the equation to set the equation to 0: $x^3 + 4x^2 - 11x - 30 - (4x-12) = 0$.\n\n8. Combine like terms on the left side: $x^3+4x^2-11x-30-4x+12=0$, which simplifies to $x^3+4x^2-15x-18=0$.\n\n9. Factor the equation by finding the roots or using some factorization techniques: Unfortunately, factoring is not straightforward here, so let's try the Rational Root Theorem.\n\n10. To solve it we will use the Rational Root Theorem which states that any rational root of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients must be of the form $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ is a factor of the constant term and $b$ is a factor of the leading coefficient. The factors of $-18$ are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6, \\pm 9, \\pm 18$. The leading coefficient is 1, so the factors are the same.\n\n11. To simplify our search, we need to check only those values: $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6, \\pm 9, \\pm 18$. \n\n12. Start plugging each value into the equation to find the roots.\n\n13. From the rational root theorem, we find that one of the solutions is $x=-2$. \n\n14. Perform polynomial division: $x^3+4x^2-15x-18=(x+2)\\cdot (x^2+2x-9)$.\n\n15. Factor the quadratic equation: $x^2+2x-9=(x+3)(x-3)$.\n\n16. So the solutions to the cubic equation are $x= -2$, $x=3$, and $x= -3$.\n\n17. Since some of the roots are the same, p can't be 3 because two distinct solutions are needed. The only two possible solutions p = 3 or q = 3 are the solutions p = 3 or q = -3.\n\n18. Plug p = 3 into the given equation: p = 3 is some value that we know is not the only solution, but 3 is one of the roots. To solve for p, we will use p = 3. \n\n19. Plug q = -3 into the given equation. q = -3 is the other possible solution of p and some other number = -3.\n\n20. p is the first solution, and q is the second solution we have found so far.\n\n21. The problem asks to find p-q.\n\n22. If p=3 and q=-3 then p - q is (3) - (-3), which equals\n\n23. Solve the subtraction problem (3) - (-3) is equal to +6.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{6}$."
