    "To simplify the expression, we'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\nGiven expression: $5(3-i)+3i(5-i)$\n\nStep 1: Distribute the terms inside the parentheses.\n$5(3-i) = 15-5i$\n$3i(5-i) = 15i-3i^2$\n\nStep 2: Simplify $i^2$.\n$i^2 = -1$, since $i$ is the imaginary unit.\nSo, $15i-3i^2 = 15i-3(-1) = 15i+3$\n\nStep 3: Combine like terms.\nNow we have: $(15-5i)+(15i+3)$\n\nStep 4: Add the real parts together and the imaginary parts together.\nReal part: $15+3 = 18$\nImaginary part: $-5i+15i = 10i$\n\nStep 5: Combine the real and imaginary parts.\n$18+10i$\n\nTherefore, the simplified answer is: $\\boxed{18+10i}$",
    "To simplify the expression $5(3-i)+3i(5-i)$, we'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1. Distribute the terms inside each parenthesis:\n\n$5(3-i)$ = $15-5i$\n$3i(5-i)$ = $15i-3i^2$\n\n2. Substitute $i^2$ with its value, which is $-1$: \n\n$15i-3i^2$ = $15i-3(-1)$ = $15i+3$\n\n3. Now we can rewrite the entire expression with these simplified terms:\n\n$15-5i + 15i + 3$\n\n4. Combine the like terms (real terms and imaginary terms separately):\n\nReal terms: $15 + 3$ = $18$\nImaginary terms: $-5i + 15i$ = $10i$\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to: $18 + 10i$\n\nHere's the simplified expression with the answer format as requested:\n\n$\\boxed{18 + 10i}$",
    "To simplify $5(3-i)+3i(5-i)$, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Distribute the numbers outside the parentheses to the terms inside:\n   - $5(3-i) = 15 - 5i$\n   - $3i(5-i) = 15i - 3i^2$\n\n2. Recall that $i^2 = -1$, so we can substitute this into the equation:\n   - $3i^2 = 3(-1) = -3$\n   - Therefore, $15i - 3i^2 = 15i + 3$\n\n3. Now, we'll add the results of the two terms:\n   - $(15 - 5i) + (15i + 3) = 15 + 3 - 5i + 15i$\n   - Combine the like terms:\n   - $15 + 3 = 18$\n   - $-5i + 15i = 10i$\n\n4. The simplified expression is:\n   - $18 + 10i$\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{18+10i}$."
