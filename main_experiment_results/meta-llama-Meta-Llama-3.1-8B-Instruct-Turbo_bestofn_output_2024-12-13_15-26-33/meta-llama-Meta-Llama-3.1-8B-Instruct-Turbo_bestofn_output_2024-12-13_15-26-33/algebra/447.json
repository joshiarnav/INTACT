    "To find the value of p - q, we need to solve the given equation and find the values of p and q.\n\nFirst, let's expand the left side of the equation:\n\n(x-3)(x+3) = x^2 - 9\n\nNow, let's rewrite the original equation:\n\nx^2 - 9 = 21x - 63\n\nNext, let's rearrange the equation by moving all terms to the left side:\n\nx^2 - 21x + 54 = 0\n\nNow, let's try to factor the left side of the equation (if possible), which has no clear factors. So we will use the quadratic formula, which is:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = 1, b = -21, and c = 54. Let's substitute these values into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (21 \u00b1 sqrt((-21)^2 - 4(1)(54))) / 2(1)\nx = (21 \u00b1 sqrt(441 - 216)) / 2\nx = (21 \u00b1 sqrt(225)) / 2\nx = (21 \u00b1 15) / 2\n\nNow, let's find the two solutions:\n\nx = (21 + 15) / 2 = 18\nx = (21 - 15) / 2 = 3\n\nSo, the two solutions are p = 18 and q = 3, and p > q.\n\nNow, let's find the value of p - q:\n\np - q = 18 - 3 = 15\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{15}$.",

  "critique": "Both solutions are correct and lead to the same answer. However, I will evaluate them based on their clarity, step-by-step reasoning, and overall presentation.\n\nSolution 1 is slightly more concise and easier to follow, as it directly jumps into solving the equation using the quadratic formula. It also explicitly states the values of a, b, and c, making it easier to understand.\n\nSolution 2 provides a bit more explanation and justification for using the quadratic formula, but it also has some minor errors in formatting and spacing.\n\nBased on these considerations, I would rate Solution 1 as the better solution.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1",
  "solution": "Factoring the right side, we can see that $(x-3)(x+3) = 21(x-3)$. Simplifying, we have $(x-3)(x+3) - 21(x-3) = (x-3)(x-18),$ and therefore our $p$ and $q$ are 18 and 3. Therefore, $p - q = \\boxed{15}.$",
