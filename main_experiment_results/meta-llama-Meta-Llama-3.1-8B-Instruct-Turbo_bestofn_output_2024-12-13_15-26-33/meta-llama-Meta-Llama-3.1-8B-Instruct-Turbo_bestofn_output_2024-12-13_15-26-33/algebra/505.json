    "To solve the given problem, let's analyze the function graph $y=p(x)$ step by step.\n\nThe graph of the function $y=p(x)$ has a point at $x=1.5.$ We are also given that the value of $p(1.5)$ is an integer. This suggests that we should focus on finding the integer value at the point where $x=1.5$ in the graph.\n\nNow let's analyze the graph in more detail. There are a set of points on the graph for values of $x=-3,-1,1,3$. This indicates that there is an involvement of $function s=$ absolute value $f(x)$ which denotes $ x for the non-negative part and $ -x for the negative part, we have $ |x| = x $ if $ x \\ge 0 $ and $ |x| = -x $ if $ x < 0 $. With the particular case being absolute value functions, we begin to understand that the function represents the family of functions $ f(x) = |x|^{m} $. As seen in the graph, we observe several absolute values, and the function is particularly being represented as a fractional exponent of absolute value, along with some other components with absolute values.\n\nTo address our problem, we see that the point of interest lies below $x=2$ where the function has its turning point. The combination $y=p(x)$ when dealing with combination of absolute values in the function should be evaluated with $sgn$ to denote sign.\n\nNow let's find $p(1.5)$ using the value given from $f(x)$. Our equation is as follows,\n\\begin{align*}\np(x)&=sgn(2x-2)*abs(2x-2)^(1/3)+2*sgn(2x-2)*abs(2x-2)^(1/5)+abs(2x-2)^(1/7)\n\\end{align*}\nThe $function s=$ sign function which denotes $1$ for non-negative values, $-1$ for negative values and is applied in the expression of $f(x)$ before absolute value. Given that  $x=1.5$ which makes $2x-2=0.5$ as positive, applicating the sign function we can substitute it into the expression,\n\\begin{align*}\np(1.5)&=sgn(0.5)*|0.5|^{1/3}+2*sgn(0.5)*|0.5|^{1/5}+|0.5|^{1/7}\\\\\np(1.5)&=1*|0.5|^{1/3}+2*1*|0.5|^{1/5}+|0.5|^{1/7}\\\\\np(1.5)&=|0.5|^{1/3}+2*|0.5|^{1/5}+|0.5|^{1/7}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\n\\begin{align*}\np(1.5)&=(0.5)^{1/3}+2*(0.5)^{1/5}+(0.5)^{1/7}\\\\\np(1.5)&=1.442+2*0.826+0.569\\\\\np(1.5)&=1.442+1.652+0.569\\\\\np(1.5)&=3.663\n\\end{align*}\n\nso $p(1.5)=\\boxed{4}$"
