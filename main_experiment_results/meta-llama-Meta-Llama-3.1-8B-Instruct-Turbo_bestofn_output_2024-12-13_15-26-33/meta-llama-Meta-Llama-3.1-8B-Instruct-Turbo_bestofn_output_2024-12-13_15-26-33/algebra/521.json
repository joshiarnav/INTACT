    "To solve the given problem, let's start by manipulating the given equation $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{18}$.\n\n1. Multiply both sides by $xy$ to get rid of the denominators:\n\\[ y + x = \\frac{xy}{18} \\]\n\n2. We want to get the equation in terms of $x + y$. To do this, let's multiply both sides by 18, then we'll have\n\\[ 18x + 18y = xy \\]\n\n3. Rearrange the equation to get it in a more familiar form:\n\\[ xy - 18x - 18y = 0 \\]\n\n4. Now, let's try to factor the equation to make it easier to work with. Adding 324 to both sides to do this, we get:\n\\[ xy - 18x - 18y + 324 = 324 \\]\n\n5. Now we can factor the left-hand side into the following expression: \n\\[ (x-18)(y-18) = 324 \\]\n\n6. The next step is to find two numbers that multiply to 324 and are as close to each other as possible. 324 can be factored as 2 * 162, 3 * 108, 4 * 81, 6 * 54, or 9 * 36. The last two pairs are the closest numbers. So, we set $x - 18$ equal to 9 and $y - 18$ equal to 36 or vice versa.\n\n7. The equation that we set up in step 6 results in the equation for x:\n\\[ x - 18 = 9 \\]\n\\[ x = 27 \\]\n\n8. Similarly, we set up the equation to solve for y:\n\\[ y - 18 = 36 \\]\n\\[ y = 54 \\]\n\n9. Now that we have the values of x and y, we can add them together to get the answer for the problem.\n\\[ x + y = 27 + 54 \\]\n\\[ x + y = 81 \\]\n\nGiven that the original question stated that x + y must be in the format of [answer], the answer to the problem is:\n\n\\boxed{81}",
