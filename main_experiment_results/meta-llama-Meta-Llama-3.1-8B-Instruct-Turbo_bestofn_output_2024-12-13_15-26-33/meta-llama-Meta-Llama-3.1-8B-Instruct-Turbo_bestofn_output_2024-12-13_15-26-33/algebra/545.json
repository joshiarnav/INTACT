    "To find the values of $m$ and $b$, we first need to find the slope, $m$, and the y-intercept, $b$, of the line.\n\nStep 1: Find the y-intercept, $b$. The y-intercept is where the line crosses the y-axis. The y-axis is the vertical line, $x=0$. We can find the point where the line crosses the y-axis by drawing a vertical line from that point to $x=0$. After doing that we can see that $b=5$.\n\nStep 2: Find the slope, $m$. The slope is the change in $y$ over the change in $x$. This change in $x$ is called the run and the change in $y$ is called the rise. We can use any two points on the line to calculate the slope. Let's use the points where the line crosses the grid, $(2,5)$ and $(-3,-5)$.\n\nTo find the slope we need to calculate the rise and the run:\n- Rise: The change in $y$: $\\Delta y = 5 - (-5) = 10$.\n- Run: The change in $x$: $\\Delta x = 2 - (-3) = 5$\n\nThe slope $m$ is $\\frac{rise}{run}$ or $\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$. So, $m = \\frac{10}{5} = 2$.\n\nStep 3: Find $mb$ by multiplying the values of $m$ and $b$ we calculated:\n$mb = 2 \\cdot 5 = 10$\n\nTherefore, the value of $mb$ is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we first need to find the equation of the line. To do this, we will choose any two points on the line and use them to find the slope and the y-intercept.\n\nLet's choose points (-3,-5) and (2,5) on the line.\n\nUsing the slope formula: $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$\n\nWe substitute in our values: \n$m = \\frac{5 - (-5)}{2 - (-3)}$\n$m = \\frac{5 + 5}{2 + 3}$\n$m = \\frac{10}{5}$\n$m = 2$\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can choose one of our points to find b.

  "solution": "Looking at the graph, we can see the line intersects the y-axis at y=1.  This is the y-intercept, which is equal to the value of $b$.  Now, we need to find the slope of the line.  Looking carefully, we can see that for every one unit to the right the line travels, it goes up by two units.  For example, starting from the y-intercept at $(0,1)$, the line passes through a lattice point one unit over and two units up from there, at $(1,3)$.  The rise over run is then $\\frac{2}{1}$, so the slope is 2.  The equation of this line is $y=2x+1$.  Therefore, $mb=2(1)=\\boxed{2}$.",
