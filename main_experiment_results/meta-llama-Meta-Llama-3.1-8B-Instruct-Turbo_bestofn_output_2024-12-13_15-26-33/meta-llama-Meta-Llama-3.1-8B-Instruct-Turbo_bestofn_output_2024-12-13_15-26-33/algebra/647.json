    "To find the vertex of the parabola described by the equation $y=-3x^2-30x-81$, we can use the method of completing the square. \n\nFirst, let's factor out the coefficient of $x^2$, which is -3:\n\n$y = -3(x^2 + 10x) - 81$\n\nNow, we want to add and subtract a number inside the parentheses so that the expression inside the parentheses is a perfect square trinomial. Since the coefficient of $x$ is 10, we need to add and subtract $(10/2)^2 = 25$:\n\n$y = -3(x^2 + 10x + 25 - 25) - 81$\n\n$y = -3(x^2 + 10x + 25) + 75 - 81$\n\n$y = -3(x + 5)^2 - 6$\n\nNow, we can see that the vertex is the point where the expression inside the parentheses equals zero. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the vertex is $-5$.\n\nTo find the y-coordinate of the vertex, we substitute $x = -5$ into the equation:\n\n$y = -3(-5)^2 - 6$\n\n$y = -3(25) - 6$\n\n$y = -75 - 6$\n\n$y = -81$\n\nTherefore, $n = -81$. \n\n$\\boxed{-81}$",
    "To find the vertex of the parabola, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b}{2a}$\n\nIn the equation $y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81$, we can identify the coefficients as follows:\n\n$a = -3$\n$b = -30$\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{-(-30)}{2(-3)} = \\frac{30}{-6} = -5$\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate, we can find the y-coordinate by plugging this value back into the original equation:\n\n$y = -3(-5)^2 - 30(-5) - 81$\n$y = -3(25) + 150 - 81$\n$y = -75 + 150 - 81$\n$y = 150 - 156$\n$y = -6$\n\nTherefore, the vertex is at $(-5, -6)$ and $n = -6$. \n\n$\\boxed{-6}$",
    "To find the vertex of the parabola, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex:\n\n$x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$\n\nGiven equation: $y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81$\n\nComparing it with the general equation: $y = ax^2 + bx + c$\n\nWe can see that $a = -3$, $b = -30$, and $c = -81$.\n\nNow, we can plug in these values to the formula:\n\n$x = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{-30}{2(-3)} = -\\frac{-30}{-6}$\n\nTo simplify this, we can divide the numerator (-30) by the numerator (-6):\n\n$x = -\\frac{-30}{-6} = \\frac{30}{6}$\n\nNow, divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:\n\n$x = \\frac{30}{6} = \\frac{5}{1} = 5$\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the value of n by plugging x into the original equation:\n\n$y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81$\n$y = -3(5)^2 - 30(5) - 81$\n$y = -3(25) - 150 - 81$\n$y = -75 - 150 - 81$\n$y = -306$\n\nSo the value of n is -306.\n\n$\\boxed{-306}$"

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThis is because Solution 1 correctly finds the vertex of the parabola with the equation $y=-3x^2-30x-81$. The solution method is also correct, as it uses the method of completing the square.\n\nIn contrast, Solution 2 and Solution 3 contain errors. \n\nSolution 2 incorrectly finds the y-coordinate of the vertex, which is -6 instead of -81.\n\nSolution 3 incorrectly finds both the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the vertex.

  "solution": "We will complete the square on the given quadratic expression to find the vertex. Factoring $-3$ from the first two terms, we have \\[y=-3(x^2+10x)-81\\]In order to make the expression inside the parentheses a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(10/2)^2=25$ inside the parentheses. Doing this, we get \\[y=-3(x^2+10x+25-25)-81 = -3(x+5)^2-6\\]The graph of an equation of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ is a parabola with vertex at $(h,k)$, so the vertex of our parabola is at $(-5,-6)$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{-6}$.",
