    "To solve this problem, let's rearrange the given equation and try to factorize it.\n\nGiven:\n$xy + 5x + 4y = -5$\n\nAdd 20 to both sides of the equation:\n$xy + 5x + 4y + 20 = 15$\n\nNow, we can factorize it using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick:\n$(x + 4)(y + 5) = 15$\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x + 4$ and $y + 5$ are also integers. The final step is to find the factors of 15. \n\nFactors of 15 are (1, 15) and (3, 5).\n\nTo find the value of $y$, we consider the possible pairs of $x + 4$ and $y + 5$ that multiply to give 15.\n\n1. $x + 4 = 1$ and $y + 5 = 15$ \n   => $x = -3$ and $y = 10$\n\n2. $x + 4 = 3$ and $y + 5 = 5$\n   => $x = -1$ and $y = 0$\n\n3. $x + 4 = 15$ and $y + 5 = 1$\n   => $x = 11$ and $y = -4$\n\n4. $x + 4 = 5$ and $y + 5 = 3$\n   => $x = 1$ and $y = -2$\n\nIn these possibilities, we can see that $y$ is greatest when $y = 10$. Therefore, the greatest possible value of $y$ is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "To find the greatest possible value of $y$, we can rearrange the given equation to reveal its structure. \n\nGiven:\n$xy + 5x + 4y = -5$\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n$(xy + 5x + 4y) + 4 \\cdot 5 = -5 + 4 \\cdot 5$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$(x + 4)(y + 5) = 15$\n\nSince we want the greatest possible value of $y$, and $x$ and $y$ are integers, we need to find the factors of 15 that will yield the largest value of $y + 5$. \n\nThe factors of 15 are: \n(1, 15), (3, 5), (-1, -15), (-3, -5).\n\nFor each of these pairs, $x = x + 4$ and $y = y + 5.$\n(1, 15) becomes \n(5, 20)\n(3, 5) becomes \n(7, 10)\n(-1, -15) becomes \n(-3, 0)\n(-3, -5) becomes \n(-1, -10).\n\nTo get the greatest value of $y$, we look at $y + 5$.

    "To solve this problem, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, a technique that involves manipulating an equation in a way that allows it to be factored into a form that is easier to solve.\n\nThe given equation is $xy+5x+4y=-5$. \n\nFirst, we add 20 to both sides of the equation, which gives us:\n$xy+5x+4y+20=15$.\n\nNext, we factor the equation:\n$(x+4)(y+5)=15$.\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are integers, the factors $(x+4)$ and $(y+5)$ must be integers as well.

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 1 and Solution 3, both of which yield the correct answer of 10.

  "solution": "Note that $(x+4)(y+5)$ equals $xy+5x+4y+20$.  So, add $20$ to both sides of the original equation to get $xy+5x+4y+20=15$, so now we may apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and write the equation as $(x+4)(y+5)=15$.\n\nThen, the potential ordered pairs $((x+4),(y+5))$ with $x<y$ are $(-15,-1)$, $(-5,-3)$, $(1,15)$ and $(3,5)$, since these are the pairs of integers that multiply to 15.  The greatest value for $y+5$ is thus $15$.  We solve $y+5=15$ for $y$ to yield $y=\\boxed{10}$.",
