    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\n1. First, we're given the time it took Steve to run 3 miles: 24 minutes. \n   We know that the time it took for Jordan to run 2 miles is half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles.\n\n2. Since Jordan's time is half Steve's time, we multiply Steve's time by 1/2 to find Jordan's time for 2 miles.\n   (1/2) * 24 minutes = 12 minutes for Jordan to run 2 miles.\n\n3. Next, we want to find the rate at which Jordan runs. We can do this by converting the time it took for Jordan to run 2 miles into miles per minute.\n   Rate = Distance / Time\n   Rate = 2 miles / 12 minutes\n   Rate = 1/6 miles per minute\n\n4. Now, we need to find how long it takes Jordan to run 5 miles at this rate.\n   Time = Distance / Rate\n   Time = 5 miles / (1/6 miles per minute)\n   Time = 5 miles * 6 minutes/mile\n   Time = 30 minutes\n\nTherefore, it would take Jordan 30 minutes to run 5 miles.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{30}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\n1. First, let's find out how long it took Jordan to run 2 miles. We know it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles. Since Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles, we need to divide 24 minutes by 2 to find the time it took Jordan to run 2 miles.\n\nTime taken by Jordan to run 2 miles = 24 minutes / 2 = 12 minutes\n\n2. Next, we need to find the rate at which Jordan runs. We can calculate the rate as miles per minute. To do this, we divide the number of miles run by the time taken.\n\nRate at which Jordan runs = 2 miles / 12 minutes = 1/6 miles per minute\n\n3. Now that we have Jordan's rate, we can use it to find the time it would take him to run 5 miles.\n\nTime taken by Jordan to run 5 miles = Total distance / Rate\n= 5 miles / (1/6 miles per minute)\n= 5 * 6 minutes\n= 30 minutes\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{30}$ minutes."

  "critique": "Based on the provided solutions, both Solution 1 and Solution 2 arrive at the same answer, which is 30 minutes. However, Solution 1 is slightly more detailed and easier to understand in its explanation, especially in step 3 where it explicitly converts the time from minutes to miles per minute before calculating the total time. \n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "solution": "Since Steve's 3-mile time is 24 minutes, Jordan ran 2 miles in $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot24=12$ minutes.  Therefore, each mile takes Jordan 6 minutes to run, so he would take $6\\cdot5=\\boxed{30}$ minutes to run five miles.",
