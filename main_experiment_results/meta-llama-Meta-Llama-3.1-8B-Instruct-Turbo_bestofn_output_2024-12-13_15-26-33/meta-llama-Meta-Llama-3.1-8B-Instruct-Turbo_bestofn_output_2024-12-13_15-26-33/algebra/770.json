    "To ensure each friend receives a unique number of coins, we need to find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to 12 (since the friends are numbered from 1 to 12). The smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to 12 is $2^4 = 16$. This means that the number of coins must be at least 16.\n\nHowever, Alex currently has 63 coins, so he doesn't need any additional coins to meet the condition he has more than 16 available.\n\nTherefore, the answer is  $\\boxed{0}$.",
    "To find the minimum number of additional coins Alex needs, let's first consider how to distribute the coins among his 12 friends uniquely.\n\nThe smallest possible number of coins Alex can give to his friends is 1 (to the first friend), 2 (to the second friend), 3 (to the third friend), and so on, until the 12th friend receives 12 coins.\n\nWe can calculate the total number of coins given to the friends by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nTotal = (n * (a1 + an)) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of friends (12), a1 is the number of coins given to the first friend (1), and an is the number of coins given to the nth friend (12).\n\nTotal = (12 * (1 + 12)) / 2\nTotal = (12 * 13) / 2\nTotal = 156 / 2\nTotal = 78\n\nSo, 78 coins are needed to distribute among Alex's friends uniquely, ensuring that each friend receives a different number of coins.\n\nSince Alex already has 63 coins, he needs to have at least 78 - 63 = 15 more coins.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of additional coins Alex needs is $\\boxed{15}$.",
    "To find the minimum number of additional coins Alex needs, let's calculate the total number of coins he will have after giving each friend at least one coin and a unique number of coins.\n\nAlex has 12 friends, so he will give 1 coin to the first friend, 2 coins to the second friend, 3 coins to the third friend, and so on, until giving 12 coins to the twelfth friend. \n\nThis sequence is called an arithmetic series: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12.\n\nTo find the sum of this arithmetic series, we can use the formula:\n\nSum = (n(n + 1))/2\n\nwhere n is the number of terms (in this case, 12 friends).\n\nSum = (12(12 + 1))/2\nSum = (12 * 13) / 2\nSum = 156 / 2\nSum = 78\n\nThis means Alex will need at least 78 coins to give each friend a unique number of coins, from 1 to 12.\n\nSince Alex already has 63 coins, we need to add the difference between 78 (required coins) and 63 (available coins) to find the minimum number of additional coins he needs.\n\nAdditional coins needed = 78 - 63\nAdditional coins needed = 15\n\nTherefore, Alex needs a minimum of $\\boxed{15}$ additional coins."

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, let's evaluate each solution based on its accuracy.\n\nSolution 1: This solution is incorrect because it assumes that Alex needs at least 16 coins to meet the condition, but it doesn't consider the requirement for each friend to receive a unique number of coins.\n\nSolution 2: This solution is correct. It calculates the total number of coins needed to distribute among Alex's friends uniquely, ensuring that each friend receives a different number of coins. The solution correctly determines that Alex needs 15 more coins to meet the condition.\n\nSolution 3: This solution is also correct. It uses the same formula to calculate the total number of coins needed and arrives at the same conclusion as Solution 2: Alex needs 15 more coins.\n\nSince both Solution 2 and Solution 3 are correct, but Solution 2 is presented first, it can be considered the \"best\" solution based on the order in which they were presented.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is 2.",
  "solution": "Alex wants to minimize the number of coins he gives to his friends without giving any two of them the same number of coins. The minimum number of coins he can give to a friend is 1. He then gives 2 coins to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 12. The total number of coins Alex has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+12 = \\frac{12 \\cdot 13}{2}=78$.  Thus, Alex needs $78-63=\\boxed{15}$ more coins.",
