  "problem": "Anton has two species of ants, Species A and Species B, in his ant farm. The two species are identical in appearance, but Anton knows that every day, there are twice as many ants of Species A than before, while there are three times as many ants of Species B. On Day 0, Anton counts that there are 30 ants in his ant farm. On Day 5, Anton counts that there are 3281 ants in his ant farm. How many of these are of Species A?",

    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nLet's assume that on day 0, the number of ants of Species A is x and the number of ants of Species B is y. Since the total number of ants on day 0 is 30, we can write:\n\nx + y = 30\n\nWe know that the number of ants of Species A doubles every day, so after 5 days, there will be 2^5 * x ants of Species A. Similarly, the number of ants of Species B triples every day, so after 5 days, there will be 3^5 * y ants of Species B.\n\nWe are given that on day 5, the total number of ants in the ant farm is 3281. So, we can write:\n\n2^5 * x + 3^5 * y = 3281\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation:\n\n32x + 243y = 3281\n\nWe already know that x + y = 30, which we can express as y = 30 - x. We can now substitute this into the first equation and solve for x.\n\n32x + 243(30 - x) = 3281\n\nExpanding this equation, we get:\n\n32x + 7290 - 243x = 3281\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-211x = -4009\n\nDivide both sides by -211:\n\nx = 19\n\nNow that we know the value of x, we can find y:\n\ny = 30 - x\n= 30 - 19\n= 11\n\nSo, on day 0, there are 19 ants of Species A and 11 ants of Species B.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ants of Species A on day 5:\n\n2^5 * x = 32 * 19\n= 608\n\nTherefore, on day 5, there are 608 ants of Species A.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{608}$.",

  "solution": "Suppose that there are $a$ ants of Species A and $b$ ants of Species B on Day 0. We thus have that $a+b=30$. Notice that on Day 1, there will be $2a$ ants of Species A, on Day 2, there will be $2(2a) = 4a$ ants of Species A, and on Day 3, there will be $2(4a)=8a$ ants of Species A, etc. Following this line of reasoning, on Day 5, there will be $2^5a$ ants of Species A and $3^5b$ ants of Species B, meaning that $32a+243b=3281$. We now solve this system of linear equations. We have that $32a+32b=960$, so \\begin{align*}(32a+243b)-(32a+32b) &= 211b \\\\\n&= 3281-960 \\\\\n&= 2321.\\end{align*}We then have $b = \\frac{2321}{211} = 11$. This means that $a=30-11=19$, and there are $32\\cdot 19 = \\boxed{608}$ ants of Species A on Day 5.",
