    "To solve this problem, let's consider two positive integers, $a$ and $b$, where neither $a$ nor $b$ is 0. Since the integers are relatively prime, they have no common factors other than 1.\n\nGiven that the product of the two integers plus their sum is 103, we can write an equation:\n\n$$ab + a + b = 103$$\n\nTo simplify the equation and make it easier to solve, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick. We can subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\n$$ab + a + b - 1 = 102$$\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n$$(a + 1)(b + 1) = 102$$\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, we can look for the factor pairs of 102 that satisfy this condition.\n\nThe factor pairs of 102 are:\n\n- 1, 102\n- 2, 51\n- 3, 34\n- 6, 17\n\nConsidering that $a$ and $b$ are less than 20 and $(a + 1)$ and $(b + 1)$ are factor pairs of 102, we can try each pair:\n\n- If $(a + 1) = 1$ and $(b + 1) = 102$ or vice versa, then $a = 0$, which is not allowed.\n- If $(a + 1) = 2$ and $(b + 1) = 51$ or vice versa, then $a = 1$ and $b = 50$ or vice versa, which does not satisfy the condition that each is less than 20.\n- If $(a + 1) = 3$ and $(b + 1) = 34$ or vice versa, then $a = 2$ and $b = 33$ or vice versa, which does not satisfy the condition that each is less than 20.\n- If $(a + 1) = 6$ and $(b + 1) = 17$ or vice versa, then $a = 5$ and $b = 16$ or vice versa.\n\nConsidering all the possibilities, we have two valid pairs: (5, 16) and (16, 5).\n\nSince the integers are relatively prime and $a < b$, we can conclude that the pair (5, 16) is the correct solution. The sum of the two integers is:\n\n$$a + b = 5 + 16 = 21$$\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{21}$",
    "To solve this problem, let's denote the two positive integers as $x$ and $y$. We are given that their product plus their sum is $103$, i.e., $xy + x + y = 103$. \n\nSince the two integers are relatively prime, their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. As they are both less than $20$ and their product is greater than $1$, we can proceed by only considering possible factors of numbers less than $20$. \n\nA key step in simplifying this problem is to apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, which involves adding a specific value to both sides of an equation so that the left side factors into a well-known product of two binomials. We add $1$ to both sides of the given equation, which gives us $xy + x + y + 1 = 104$. \n\nUsing the addition rule for multiplying out the left-hand side expression (a+b)(c+d)=ac+ad+bc+bd we can rearrange $(x+1)(y+1)$ and we get: \n\n$$\n(x+1)(y+1) = 104.\n$$\n\nAs we are given the condition that $104$ is the product of two relatively prime numbers. Here 104 can be represented as $104=2^3\\cdot 13,$ i.e.\n $$4 \\cdot 26$$ or $$2 \\cdot 52,$$ which can't factor down into smaller positive integers. Instead,  we know that for our original problem, $(x+1)$ is $2$ times $(y+1)$. Or, $(x+1)$ is $(y+1)$ times $4$, or the multiplicative inverse of $(x+1)$ is $(y+1)$ when $(y+1)$ is $2$ and $(x+1)$ is $52$, and vice versa. \n\nHere since $x$ and $y$ are both less than 20, we can deduce two cases for $(x+1)$ and $(y+1)$ as follows, \nCase 1: $(x+1)$ is 2 factors of 13, \nSince the number is prime we deduce $(x+1)$ is $13$ and $(y+1)$ is $8$, \nsince their sum for the original problem $(x+1)(y+1)=104$ must hold.\nCase 2: $(x+1)$ or $(y+1)$ is a factor of 4,$(x+1)$ is 4 which implies $x$ is $3$ which is in contradiction to $(x+1)(y+1)$ being 104. Similarly $(x+1)$ is 2 and $(y+1)$ is 52, which also violates the problem given. $(x+1)$ must be the remaining number multiplicative inverse of 3 so $(x+1)$ must equal $(y+1)$ i.e., 4\u00d713, and $y$ and $x$ which will always violate the equation $(x+1)(y+1) =100$. \nif  $(y+1)=4$, then $(x+1)=26$ and this is a violation as $(x+1)(y+1)$ is 104 not $26 \\times 4$. However, $(y+1)$ could be $13$, implying  $(x+1)$ is $8$,$x$ is $7$ and $y$ is $12.$ The sum of $x$ and $y$, i.e $x+y$, is $\\boxed{19}$."

  "solution": "Let our numbers be $a$ and $b$ with $a>b.$ Then $ab+a+b=103$. With Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick in mind, we add $1$ to both sides and get $ab+a+b+1 = 104$, which factors as $(a+1)(b+1)=104$. We consider pairs $(a+1, b+1)$ of factors of $104$: $(104,1), (52,2), (26,4), (13,8)$. Since $a<20$, we can rule out the first 3 pairs, which gives $a=12$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\\boxed{19}$.",
