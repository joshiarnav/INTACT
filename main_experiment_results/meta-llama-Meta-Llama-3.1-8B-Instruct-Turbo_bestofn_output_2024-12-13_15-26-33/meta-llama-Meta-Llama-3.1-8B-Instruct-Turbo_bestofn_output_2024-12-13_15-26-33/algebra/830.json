    "To find the area at Stage 6, let's break it down:\n\n1. Stage 1 has 1 square, which is a 3'' by 3'' square. The area is 3 * 3 = 9 square inches.\n\n2. Stage 2 has 2 squares, so the length becomes 2 * 3 = 6 inches, and the area is 6 * 3 = 18 square inches.\n\n3. Stage 3 has 3 squares, so the length becomes 3 * 3 = 9 inches, and the area is 9 * 3 = 27 square inches.\n\n4. Stage 4 has 4 squares, so the length becomes 4 * 3 = 12 inches, and the area is 12 * 3 = 36 square inches.\n\n5. Stage 5 has 5 squares, so the length becomes 5 * 3 = 15 inches, and the area is 15 * 3 = 45 square inches.\n\n6. Stage 6 has 6 squares, so the length becomes 6 * 3 = 18 inches, and the area is 18 * 3 = 54 square inches.\n\nTherefore, the area at Stage 6 is 54 square inches.\n\n$\\boxed{54}$",
    "To find the area of the rectangle at Stage 6, we first need to understand how the area changes at each stage.\n\nAt Stage 1, we have 1 square with an area of 3 * 3 = 9 square inches.\n\nAt Stage 2, we have 2 squares with areas of 3 * 3 = 9 square inches each. So, the total area is 9 + 9 = 18 square inches.\n\nAt Stage 3, we have 3 squares with areas of 3 * 3 = 9 square inches each. So, the total area is 18 + 9 = 27 square inches.\n\nAt Stage 4, we have 4 squares with areas of 3 * 3 = 9 square inches each. So, the total area is 27 + 9 = 36 square inches.\n\nAt Stage 5, we have 5 squares with areas of 3 * 3 = 9 square inches each. So, the total area is 36 + 9 = 45 square inches.\n\nAt Stage 6, we have 6 squares with areas of 3 * 3 = 9 square inches each. So, the total area is 45 + 9 = 54 square inches.\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle at Stage 6, in square inches, is $\\boxed{54}$.",
    "At Stage 1, there is 1 3'' by 3'' square, so the length of the rectangle is 3 and the width is 3, resulting in an area of $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ square inches.\n\nAt Stage 2, another 3'' by 3'' square is added on the right, so the length is now 6 and the width is 3, resulting in an area of $6 \\cdot 3 = 18$ square inches.\n\nAt Stage 3, another 3'' by 3'' square is added on the right, so the length is now 9 and the width is 3, resulting in an area of $9 \\cdot 3 = 27$ square inches.\n\nAt Stage 4, another 3'' by 3'' square is added on the right, so the length is now 12 and the width is 3, resulting in an area of $12 \\cdot 3 = 36$ square inches.\n\nAt Stage 5, another 3'' by 3'' square is added on the right, so the length is now 15 and the width is 3, resulting in an area of $15 \\cdot 3 = 45$ square inches.\n\nAt Stage 6, another 3'' by 3'' square is added on the right, so the length is now 18 and the width is 3, resulting in an area of $18 \\cdot 3 = 54$ square inches.\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle at Stage 6 is $\\boxed{54}$ square inches."
