    "To find the value of $a$, we'll follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Recall the vertex form of a quadratic equation: \n\\[y = a(x - h)^2 + k\\]\nwhere $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the parabola. Given that the vertex is $(-4,0)$, the equation can be written as:\n\\[y = a(x + 4)^2\\]\n\nStep 2: Since the parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, we can substitute the coordinates of this point into the equation to find $a$:\n\\[-75 = a(1 + 4)^2\\]\n\\[-75 = a(5)^2\\]\n\\[-75 = a(25)\\]\n\nStep 3: Now, we can solve for $a$:\n\\[a = \\frac{-75}{25}\\]\n\\[a = -3\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{-3}$.",
