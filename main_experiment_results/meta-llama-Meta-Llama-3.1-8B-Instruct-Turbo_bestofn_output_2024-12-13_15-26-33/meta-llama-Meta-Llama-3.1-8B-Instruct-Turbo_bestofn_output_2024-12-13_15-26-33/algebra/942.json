    "To find the sum of the first six terms in the geometric sequence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the first term (a)**: The first term of the sequence is $\\frac12$.\n\n2. **Identify the common ratio (r)**: To find the common ratio, we divide any term by its previous term. Let's take the second term divided by the first term: $\\frac{\\frac14}{\\frac12} = \\frac12$. So, the common ratio is $\\frac12$.\n\n3. **Use the formula for a finite geometric series**: The formula to find the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is:\n\\[ S_n = \\frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1 - r} \\]\nwhere $S_n$ is the sum of the first n terms, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\n4. **Substitute the values into the formula**: Substitute a = $\\frac12$, r = $\\frac12$, and n = 6 into the formula:\n\\[ S_6 = \\frac{\\frac12(1 - (\\frac12)^6)}{1 - \\frac12} \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the expression**: Simplify the expression by evaluating the powers and fractions:\n\\[ S_6 = \\frac{\\frac12(1 - \\frac1{64})}{\\frac12} \\]\n\\[ S_6 = \\frac{\\frac12 \\cdot \\frac{63}{64}}{\\frac12} \\]\n\\[ S_6 = \\frac{63}{64} \\]\n\nSo, the sum of the first six terms in the geometric sequence is $\\boxed{\\frac{63}{64}}$.",

    "To find the sum of the first six terms in the geometric sequence $\\frac12, \\frac14, \\frac18, \\dots$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the common ratio of the sequence. The common ratio is the ratio of each term to its preceding term. In this case, we can divide the second term by the first term:\n\n   $\\frac{\\text{second term}}{\\text{first term}} = \\frac{\\frac14}{\\frac12} = \\frac12$\n\n   So, the common ratio is $\\frac12$.\n\n2. Since we know the first term and the common ratio, we can find any term using the formula: $a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{(n-1)}$, where $a_n$ is the $n$th term, $a_1$ is the first term, and $r$ is the common ratio.\n\n   The first six terms are $\\frac12, \\frac14, \\frac18, \\frac1{16}, \\frac1{32}, \\frac1{64}$.\n\n3. To find the sum of these terms, we can use the formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric sequence: \n\n   $S_n = \\frac{a_1(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}$\n\n   where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $r$ is the common ratio. \n\n   In this case, $n = 6, a_1 = \\frac12,$ and $r = \\frac12$. \n\n   Now, substitute the known values into the formula:\n\n   $S_6 = \\frac{\\frac12 (1 - (\\frac12)^6)}{1 - \\frac12} = \\frac{\\frac12 (1 - \\frac{1}{64})}{\\frac12} = \\frac{\\frac12 \\cdot \\frac{63}{64}}{\\frac12} = \\frac{63}{64}$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the first six terms in the geometric sequence is $\\boxed{\\frac{63}{64}}$."
