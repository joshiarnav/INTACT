    "To find the probability of getting heads in exactly 8 of the 10 flips, we'll break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of possible outcomes for each flip**: When we flip a coin, there are 2 possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T).\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of possible outcomes for 10 flips**: Since each flip has 2 possible outcomes, the total number of possible outcomes for 10 flips is 2^10 = 1024.\n\n3. **Determine the number of ways to get heads in exactly 8 out of 10 flips**: This is a combination problem, and we can use the formula C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n - r)!] to find the number of ways. In this case, n = 10 (total number of flips) and r = 8 (number of heads). Therefore, the number of ways to get heads in exactly 8 out of 10 flips is C(10, 8) = 10! / [8!(10 - 8)!] = 45.\n\n4. **Calculate the probability of each of these combinations**: The probability of getting heads in 8 flips and tails in 2 flips is (1/2)^8 * (1/2)^2 = (1/2)^10 = 1/1024, since each flip is independent.\n\n5. **Multiply the number of combinations by the probability of each combination**: The probability of getting heads in exactly 8 of the 10 flips is C(10, 8) * (1/2)^10 = 45 * (1/1024) = 45/1024.\n\nTherefore, the probability that we get heads in exactly 8 of the 10 flips is $\\boxed{45/1024}$.",

    "To find the probability of getting heads exactly 8 times in 10 flips, we will break it down step by step.\n\n1. First, we need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when flipping a coin 10 times. Since each flip has two possible outcomes (heads or tails), the total number of outcomes for 10 flips is $2^{10} = 1024$.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the number of ways we can get exactly 8 heads out of 10 flips. This can be calculated using the combination formula, $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of trials, and $r$ is the number of successful trials. In this case, $n = 10$ and $r = 8$. So, the number of ways to get exactly 8 heads is $\\binom{10}{8} = \\frac{10!}{8!(10-8)!} = 45$.\n\n3. Now that we have the number of ways to get exactly 8 heads, we can calculate the probability. The probability is equal to the number of successful outcomes (getting exactly 8 heads) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (which is $2^{10} = 1024$). So, the probability is $\\frac{45}{1024}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting heads exactly 8 times in 10 flips is $\\boxed{\\frac{45}{1024}}$."
