  "problem": "How many distinct sequences of four letters can be made from the letters in EQUALS if each sequence must begin with L, end with Q, and no letter can appear in a sequence more than once?",
  "all_solutions": [
    "To find the total number of distinct sequences, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The first letter must be 'L', so we have only 1 choice for this position.\n2. The last letter must be 'Q', so we have only 1 choice for this position as well.\n\nNow, we're left with the middle two positions. We have 4 letters available: E, U, A, and S. Since no letter can appear in the sequence more than once, for the second position, we have 4 choices.\n\nAfter choosing the letter for the second position, we have 3 remaining letters to choose from for the third position.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct sequences is calculated as follows:\n\n1 (first position) * 4 (second position) * 3 (third position) = 12\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "To find the number of distinct sequences of four letters that begin with L, end with Q, and have no repeated letters, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. The first letter is fixed as L, so there is 1 choice for the first position.\n2. The last letter is fixed as Q, so there is 1 choice for the last position.\n3. We have 4 remaining letters: E, U, A, and S. We need to choose 2 letters from these 4 to fill the middle positions.\n4. Since the order of the middle letters matters (i.e., UE is different from EU), we need to find the number of permutations of 2 letters from 4.\n   The number of permutations of r objects from n distinct objects is given by the multinomial coefficient nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where ! denotes the factorial.\n   In this case, n = 4 (the number of remaining letters) and r = 2 (the number of letters to choose).\n   So, the number of permutations of 2 letters from 4 is 4C2 = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 4! / (2!2!) = (4*3) / (2*1) = 6\n5. Now we have the number of choices for the middle two positions, which is 6.\n6. Since the first and last positions are fixed, and we have 6 choices for the middle two positions, the total number of distinct sequences of four letters is 1 * 6 * 1 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct sequences of four letters that begin with L, end with Q, and have no repeated letters is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "To find the number of distinct sequences of four letters that can be made from the letters in EQUALS, we need to follow the given conditions.\n\n1. The sequence must begin with L, so the first letter is fixed as L. This means we cannot choose L for the remaining three positions.\n\n2. The sequence must end with Q, so the fourth position is fixed as Q. This means we cannot choose Q for the first, second, or third position, as those positions are already filled by L and other letters.\n\n3. No letter can appear in a sequence more than once.\n\nNow, let's calculate the possibilities for the second and third positions.\n\nThe available letters for the second position are E, A, U, and S, which is 4 possibilities.\n\nAfter selecting the second position, there are 3 available letters left for the third position (since a letter cannot be repeated).\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct sequences of four letters that can be made from the letters in EQUALS is 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$."

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 1 and Solution 3, both of which give the correct answer of 12. However, since you asked for the index number of the best solution, I will choose the first one that appears in the list, which is Solution 1.\n\nSo, the index number of the best solution is 1.",
  "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",
