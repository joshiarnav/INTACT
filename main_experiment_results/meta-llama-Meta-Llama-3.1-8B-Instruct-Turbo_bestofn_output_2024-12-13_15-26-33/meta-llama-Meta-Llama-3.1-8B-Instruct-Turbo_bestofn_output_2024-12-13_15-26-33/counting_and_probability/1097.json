    "To find the number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set, we need to find all possible differences.\n\nSince we're looking for the number of different positive integers, we only need to consider the absolute difference of two distinct numbers because the order of subtraction doesn't matter.\n\nWe can break this down into steps:\n\n- Subtracting 1 from each number in the set will give us the differences 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n- Subtracting 2 from each number will give us the differences 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n- Subtracting 3 from each number will give us the differences 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n- Subtracting 4 from each number will give us the differences 3, 4, and 5.\n- Subtracting 5 from each number will give us the differences 4 and 5.\n- Subtracting 6 from each number will give us the difference 5.\n\nAfter looking at all the differences, we have the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. However, we are only interested in the positive integers. \n\nThere are 5 positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nSo, the answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
    "To solve this problem, let's analyze all the possible differences. \n\n1. The largest number in the set is 6 and the smallest is 1. \n2. The difference between the largest and smallest numbers is 6 - 1 = 5. \n3. We now need to list out all the other possible differences. \n- 6 - 2 = 4\n- 6 - 3 = 3\n- 6 - 4 = 2\n- 6 - 5 = 1\n- Other numbers and their differences will be the same or less than this.\n4. Similarly, let's calculate the other differences\n- 5 - 1 = 4\n- 5 - 2 = 3\n- 5 - 3 = 2\n- 5 - 4 = 1\n- Other numbers and their differences will be the same or less than this.\n5. Continue this process with the rest of the numbers\n- 4 - 1 = 3\n- 4 - 2 = 2\n- 4 - 3 = 1\n- Other numbers and their differences will be the same or less than this\n- 3 - 1 = 2\n- 3 - 2 = 1\n- Other numbers and their differences will be the same or less than this\n- 2 - 1 = 1\n- We don't need to continue as 1 - 1 = 0 when we have the same number, and we already found that difference.\n\nSo we found the following differences that are greater than 0: \n1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\nHence, the total number of distinct positive integers is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "To find the different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set, let's start by listing all the possible pairs of distinct members:\n\n- $(1,2)$, $(1,3)$, $(1,4)$, $(1,5)$, $(1,6)$\n- $(2,3)$, $(2,4)$, $(2,5)$, $(2,6)$\n- $(3,4)$, $(3,5)$, $(3,6)$\n- $(4,5)$, $(4,6)$\n- $(5,6)$\n\nNow, let's find the differences for each pair:\n\n- For the pairs in the first row: \n  - $2-1=1$ \n  - $3-1=2$\n  - $4-1=3$\n  - $5-1=4$\n  - $6-1=5$\n- For the pairs in the second row:\n  - $3-2=1$\n  - $4-2=2$\n  - $5-2=3$\n  - $6-2=4$\n- For the pairs in the third row:\n  - $4-3=1$\n  - $5-3=2$\n  - $6-3=3$\n- For the pairs in the fourth row:\n  - $5-4=1$\n  - $6-4=2$\n- For the pairs in the fifth row:\n  - $6-5=1$\n\nWe can see that the differences are limited to the integers $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$. Therefore, the number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set is $\\boxed{5}$."

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 3 because it is more systematic and easier to follow. It also clearly lists out all the possible pairs of distinct members and their corresponding differences, making it easier to see that the differences are limited to the integers $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is: $\\boxed{3}$",
  "solution": "It is clear that the maximal positive difference is $6 - 1 = 5$. Moreover, we can use 6 to ensure that we can get all positive integer differences up to 5: $6 - 5 = 1$, $6 - 4 = 2$, $6 - 3 = 3$, $6 - 2 = 4$, $6 - 1 = 5$. So, there are $\\boxed{5}$ possible differences.",
