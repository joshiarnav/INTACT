    "To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of ways to arrange 8 people without any restrictions. This is a permutation problem with 8 items (people) and can be calculated using the formula 8! (8 factorial), which is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 8.\n\n8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40320\n\nThis is the total number of ways to arrange 8 people in a row without any restrictions.\n\nStep 2: Now, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the 8 people with John, Wilma, and Paul sitting in three consecutive seats. To do this, we can think of John, Wilma, and Paul as a single unit (because they are sitting consecutively), so we have 6 \"units\" (5 people + 1 group of 3) to arrange.\n\nThe 6 \"units\" can be arranged in 6! ways.\n\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720\n\nHowever, within the group of John, Wilma, and Paul, they can be arranged in 3! ways.\n\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n\nSo, the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people with John, Wilma, and Paul sitting in three consecutive seats is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 \"units\" and the number of ways to arrange John, Wilma, and Paul within their group, which is 720 * 6 = 4320.\n\nStep 3: Now, we can subtract the number of ways to arrange the 8 people with John, Wilma, and Paul sitting in three consecutive seats (4320) from the total number of ways to arrange 8 people without any restrictions (40320) to get the number of ways they can be arranged with John, Wilma, and Paul not sitting in three consecutive seats.\n\n40320 - 4320 = 36000\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{36000}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of complementary counting. We will first find the total number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row, and then subtract the number of ways in which John, Wilma, and Paul sit in three consecutive seats.\n\n1. First, let's find the total number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row. This can be calculated by using the factorial of 8. \n\nThe total number of ways is $8! = 40,320$.\n\n2. Now, we will find the number of ways in which John, Wilma, and Paul sit in three consecutive seats. We can treat these three people as a single block. So, we now have 6 entities (the block of 3 people and the remaining 5 individuals) to arrange in a row.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these 6 entities is 6!, which equals 720.\n\nHowever, within the block of 3 people, there are 3! ways to arrange them. \n\nThe total number of ways in which John, Wilma, and Paul sit in three consecutive seats is 6! * 3!, which equals 4320.\n\n3. Now, we subtract the number of ways in which John, Wilma, and Paul sit in three consecutive seats from the total number of ways. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36504}$",
    "To solve this problem, we can break it down into parts. \n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row without any restrictions. This is a basic permutation problem, where we have 8 people and 8 seats. The total number of ways is 8! (8 factorial). \n\n8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40320\n\nNow, let's consider the case where John, Wilma, and Paul sit in three consecutive seats. We can treat these three people as a single unit, and we have 6 \"units\" in total (the John-Wilma-Paul unit and the other 5 people). The number of ways to arrange these 6 units is 6! (6 factorial).\n\nHowever, within the John-Wilma-Paul unit, there are 3! ways to arrange the three people. So, the total numberr of ways John, Wilma, and Paul can sit in three consecutive seats is 6! * 3!.\n\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720\n\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n\n6! * 3! = 720 * 6 = 4320\n\nNow, we can find the number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row where John, Wilma, and Paul do not sit in three consecutive seats by subtracting the number of ways they do sit in three consecutive seats from the total number of ways.\n\n40320 - 4320 = 36000\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{36000}$."

  "solution": "The number of all seating arrangements is $8!$. The number of seating arrangements in which John, Wilma and Paul sit next to each other is $6!\\times 3!$. We can arrive at $6!\\times 3!$ by considering John, Wilma and Paul as one person, arranging the ``six'' people (the JWP super-person plus the 5 other people) first, then arranging John, Wilma and Paul.  Thus the number of acceptable arrangements is $$8!-6!\\times 3!=8\\times 7\\times 6! - 6!\\times 3! = (8\\times 7 - 3!)6! = (50)(720)=\\boxed{36000}.$$",
