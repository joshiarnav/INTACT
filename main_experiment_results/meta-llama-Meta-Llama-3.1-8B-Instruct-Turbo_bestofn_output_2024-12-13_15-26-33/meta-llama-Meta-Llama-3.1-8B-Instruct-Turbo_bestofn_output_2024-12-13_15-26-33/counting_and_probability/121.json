    "To find the expected number of 1's obtained when rolling two dice, we first need to find the probability of rolling no 1's, one 1, and two 1's.\n\n1. **Probability of rolling no 1's (NN):**\n   - Each dice has 6 faces (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n   - The probability of rolling no 1 on a single dice is 5/6.\n   - Since we have two dice, we multiply the probabilities: (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36.\n\n2. **Probability of rolling one 1 (O1):**\n   - We can obtain one 1 in two ways: \n     - **Case 1:** The first dice shows a 1 and the second dice shows no 1. Probability = (1/6) * (5/6) = 5/36.\n     - **Case 2:** The first dice shows no 1 and the second dice shows a 1. Probability = (5/6) * (1/6) = 5/36.\n   - The total probability of obtaining one 1 is the sum of these probabilities: 5/36 + 5/36 = 10/36 = 5/18.\n\n3. **Probability of rolling two 1's (TT):**\n   - The probability of both dice showing a 1 is (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36.\n\nNow, we have the probabilities for each case. To find the expected number of 1's, we multiply each case by its probability and sum them up.\n\nExpected number of 1's = (Probability of rolling no 1's) * (0.1) + (Probability of rolling one 1) * (1.1) + (Probability of rolling two 1's) * (2.0)\n\n= (25/36) * (0) + (5/18) * (1.1) + (1/36) * (2)\n\n= 0 + (5*1.1)/18 + (2/36)\n\n= (5.5/18) + (1/18)\n\n= (5.5 + 1)/18\n\nExpected number of 1's = 6.5/18\nThis can be reduced further: (6.5 * 18/18)/(18/18).\n6.5 * 18 = 117 \nAnd 18/18 = 1 \nHence the fraction 117/18 can be reduced even more.\nBoth 117 and 18 can be divided by 3.\n   117 / 3 = 39\n   18 / 3 = 6\nThus: 117/18 = 39/6\n39 and 6 can be divided by 3.\n39 / 3 = 13\n6 / 3 = 2\n   Therefore expected number of 1's is 13/2\n   So answer is $\\boxed{13/2}$",
    "To find the expected number of 1's obtained when two standard dice are rolled, we can think about the possible outcomes and the probability of each one.\n\n1. **Probability of getting at least one 1**: \n   - **One 1, one non-1**: There are two ways this can happen: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) or (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So, there are 10 outcomes with a 1 but not two 1's. \n   - **Two 1's**: There are 5 outcomes with two 1's, which are (1,1), (2,1) doesn't count, (1,2) doesn't count, the same for the rest but (1,1) and (2,2), (3,3) and all the way up to (6,6).\n   - Since there are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, the probability of at least one 1 is (10 + 5)/36, which is 15/36 or 5/12.\n\n2. **Expected number of 1's**: To find the expected number of 1's, we will use the probabilities we calculated earlier and multiply by the number of 1's in each case. Then we will add up all the products.\n\n   - **Two 1's**: 5/36 \n   - **One 1, one non-1**: 10/36. Since we are interested in \"one 1\", we multiply this by 1.\n   - **No 1's**: 21/36. Since we are interested in \"no 1's\", we multiply this by 0.\n\nSo the expected number of 1's is ((5/36) * 2) + ((10/36) * 1) + ((21/36) * 0)\n\nSimplifying the above equation we get: (5/36) * 2 + (10/36)\n   - Which equals to : 10/36 + 10/36\n   - Which equals to: 20/36\n\nReducing 20/36 we get: 5/9\n\nTherefore the expected number of 1's when rolling two standard dice is $\\boxed{5/9}$.",
    "To find the expected number of 1's obtained, we need to consider the probabilities of getting 0, 1, or 2 1's.\n\nThere are 36 possible outcomes when two standard dice are rolled. \n\n- The number of ways to roll 0 1's is the number of ways to roll any non-1 number on both dice. There are 5 options (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for each die, giving us 5 * 5 = 25 possible ways to roll 0 1's.\n- The number of ways to roll 1 1 is the number of ways to roll a 1 on one die and any non-1 number on the other die. There are 5 options for the second die, and two dice to choose the first die, leading to 2(5) = 10 ways to roll 1 1. \n- The number of ways to roll 2 1's is the number of ways to roll a one on both dice, which is 1 option for each die (1, 1).\n\nNow, we need to find the probabilities of these outcomes.\n\n- P(0 1's) = 25 / 36\n- P(1 1) = 10 / 36 = 5 / 18\n- P(2 1's) = 1 / 36\n\nThe expected number of 1's is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and adding them together:\n\nExpected number of 1's = (0 * P(0 1's)) + (1 * P(1 1)) + (2 * P(2 1's))\n= (0 * 25/36) + (1 * 5/18) + (2 * 1/36)\n= 0 + 5/18 + 1/18\n= 6/18\n= 1/3\n\nTherefore, the expected number of 1's obtained is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."

  "solution": "The probability of rolling a number other than 1 on one die is $\\frac{5}{6}$, so the probability of rolling zero 1's on two dice is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{36}$. The probability of rolling a 1 on one die is $\\frac{1}{6}$, so the probability of rolling 1's on two dice (for a total of two 1's) is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{36}$. Since the only other possibility is rolling exactly one 1, the probability of rolling one 1 is $1-\\frac{25}{36}-\\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{10}{36}$. We find the expected number of 1's to be $E = \\frac{1}{36} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{10}{36} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{25}{36} \\cdot 0 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
