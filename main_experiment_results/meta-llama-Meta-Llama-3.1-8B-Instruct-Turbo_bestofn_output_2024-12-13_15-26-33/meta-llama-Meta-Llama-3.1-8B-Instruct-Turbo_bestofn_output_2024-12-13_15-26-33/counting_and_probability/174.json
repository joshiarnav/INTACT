    "To find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, let's first determine how many total three-digit numbers there are and then subtract the numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 (or both).\n\n1. Total three-digit numbers: \n   The smallest three-digit number is 100 and the largest three-digit number is 999. \n   So, there are $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$ three-digit numbers.\n\n2. Counting multiples of 5:\n   The smallest three-digit multiple of 5 is 100 and the largest three-digit multiple of 5 is 995.\n   The count of multiples of 5 is given by $(995 - 100) / 5 + 1 = 180$. \n\n3. Counting multiples of 7:\n   The smallest three-digit multiple of 7 is 105 and the largest three-digit multiple of 7 is 994.\n   The count of multiples of 7 is given by $(994 - 105) / 7 + 1 = 128$. \n\n4. Counting multiples of both 5 and 7 (35):\n   The smallest three-digit multiple of 35 is 105 and the largest three-digit multiple of 35 is 980.\n   The count of multiples of 35 is given by $(980 - 105) / 35 + 1 = 26$. \n\nNow, to avoid double-counting, we need to subtract the count of numbers that are multiples of both 5 and 7. \n\n5. Total count of numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7:\n   This is the sum of the counts of multiples of 5 and 7 minus the count of numbers that are multiples of both.\n   $180 + 128 - 26 = 282$.\n\nHowever, since we're trying to find numbers that are not multiples of 5 or 7, we need to subtract the total count of these multiples from the total count of three-digit numbers.\n\n6.

    "To find the total number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Find the total number of three-digit numbers.\nThe smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999. So, the total number of three-digit numbers is 999 - 100 + 1 = 900.\n\nStep 2: Find the numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7.\nFor multiples of 5: The smallest multiple of 5 in the three-digit range is 100, and the largest is 995. To find the count, we divide the range by 5 and round down to the nearest whole number since we're including 100. So, we get (995 - 100) / 5 + 1 = 180.\nFor multiples of 7: The smallest multiple of 7 in the three-digit range is 105, and the largest is 994. Similarly, we divide the range by 7 to get the count, then round down. So, we get (994 - 105) / 7 + 1 = 128.\n\nStep 3: Account for double counting in the multiples of 5 and 7.\nNumbers that are multiples of both 5 and 7 are multiples of 35. The smallest three-digit multiple of 35 is 105, and the largest is 980. To find the count of such numbers, we divide the range by 35 and round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us (980 - 105) / 35 + 1 = 26.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7.\nTo do this, we find the total number of multiples of 5 or 7 by adding the number of multiples of 5 and 7 and then subtract the overlapping multiples of both 35. So, we get 180 (multiples of 5) + 128 (multiples of 7) - 26 (multiples of both) = 282.\n\nStep 5: Find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7.\nTo find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, we subtract the total number of such numbers from the total number of three-digit numbers. So, we get 900 (total three-digit numbers) - 282 (numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7) = 618.\n\nTherefore, the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7 is 618.\n\n$\\boxed{618}$",
    "To find the total number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, we'll first count the total number of three-digit numbers and then subtract the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7.\n\nStep 1: Count the total number of three-digit numbers.\nWe know that the smallest three-digit number is 100 and the largest is 999. \nSo, the total number of three-digit numbers is 999 - 100 + 1 = 900.\n\nStep 2: Count the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5.\nMultiples of 5 have the unit digit as 0 or 5. So, we count the number of three-digit numbers with unit digit as 0 or 5.\nSince there are 2 possibilities for the unit digit (0 and 5), and 9 choices each for hundreds and tens place digits minus 1 for hundreds and tens digit.\nWe have (9 - 1) * 10 * 2 = 152 three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5.\n\nStep 3: Count the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7.\nThe multiples of 7 are numbers that end in 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, but only the numbers 140, 147, 154 and so on are multiples of 7, therefore in order to find the number of three digit multiples of 7 we can simply divide the range of three-digit numbers by 7 and take the appropriate floor.\nBelow-floor, for example 142 hence is one of those multiples i.e. \n $$\\left\\lfloor\\frac{(999 - 100 )}{7}\\right\\rfloor=  128 $$\n\n\nStep 4: Count the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of both 5 and 7.\nThese numbers are multiples of 35 (the LCM of 5 and 7) and they can be found by determining the number of multiples of 35 within the range of three-digit numbers.\nSo, let's divide the range of three-digit numbers by 35 and take the floor.\n $$\\left\\lfloor\\frac{(999 - 100)}{35}\\right\\rfloor= 26 $$\n\n\nStep 5: Count the total number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7.\nThis total is the sum of the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 and the number that are multiples of 7, minus the number of multiples of both (i.e., multiples of 35).\nTotal number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 = 152 + 128 - 26 = 254.\n\nStep 6: Count the total number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7.\nBy subtracting the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers, we get the final result.\nThe total number of three-digit numbers = 900.\nThe total number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 = 254.\nTherefore, the total number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7 is \n\\\\boxed{646}."

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, we need to compare the results of each solution. \n\nSolution 1 gives us a result of 618.\nSolution 2 also gives us a result of 618.\nSolution 3 gives us a result of 646.\n\nBased on the results, Solution 1 and Solution 2 are the best solutions, as they both give the same result of 618.",
  "solution": "It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 5 or 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \\times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 that is a three-digit number is $142 \\times 7 = 994$.  Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7.  The smallest multiple of 5 that is a three-digit number is $20\\times 5 = 100$, and the largest multiple of 5 that is a three digit number is $199\\times 5 =995$. So there are $199-20+1=180$ multiples of 5.\n\nNow notice that we have counted some numbers twice: those multiples of $5\\times7=35$. The smallest multiple of 35 is $3\\times 35 = 105$, the largest multiple of 35 is $28\\times35 =980$. So there are $28-3+1=26$ multiples of 35.\n\nWe have 128 multiples of 7 and 180 multiples of 5, but we count 26 multiples twice.  So, there are a total of $128+180-26 = 282$ distinct three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 (or both).   There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-282=\\boxed{618}$ three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7 nor 5.",
