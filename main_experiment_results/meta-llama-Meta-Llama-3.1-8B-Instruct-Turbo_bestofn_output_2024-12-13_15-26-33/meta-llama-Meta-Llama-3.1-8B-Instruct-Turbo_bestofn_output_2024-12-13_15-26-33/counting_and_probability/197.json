  "problem": "A pirate is searching for buried treasure on 6 islands.

    "To find the probability that the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps, we need to consider the probabilities for each island and the number of ways the islands can be arranged.\n\n- The probability of an island having treasure and no traps is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n- The probability of an island having neither traps nor treasure is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nWe want exactly 3 islands with treasure and 3 islands with neither traps nor treasure. To find the number of ways this can occur, we can use combinations. The number of ways to choose 3 out of 6 islands for treasure is $\\binom{6}{3}=20$.\n\nFor each combination, the probability is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3\\cdot\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3$.\n\nCombining this, the total probability is $20\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3\\cdot\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3=20\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{64}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{8}{27}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$.",

This is a binomial probability problem with multiple trials (6 islands), a number of successes (3 islands with treasure), and a probability of success (finding an island with treasure). \n\nThe probability of getting exactly 3 islands with treasure in 6 trials is calculated as follows:\n\n- The probability of success (finding an island with treasure): $\\frac{1}{4}$\n- The probability of failure (not finding an island with treasure): $1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$ (this includes both islands with neither treasure nor traps)\n- Number of trials: 6\n- Number of successes: 3\n\nThe binomial probability formula is given by: \n\\[ P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\times p^k \\times (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\nwhere $P(X=k)$ is the probability that we get exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials, $\\binom{n}{k}$ is the number of ways to choose $k$ successes in $n$ trials, $p$ is the probability of success in a single trial, and $(1-p)$ is the probability of failure in a single trial.\n\nTo find the number of ways to choose 3 islands with treasure in 6 islands: $\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3! \\cdot 3!} = 20$\n\nNow we can calculate the probability:\n\n\\[ P(X=3) = \\binom{6}{3} \\times (\\frac{1}{4})^{3} \\times (\\frac{3}{4})^{6-3} = 20 \\times (\\frac{1}{4})^{3} \\times (\\frac{3}{4})^{3} \\]\n\n\\[ P(X=3) = 20 \\times \\frac{1}{64} \\times \\frac{27}{64} = 20 \\times \\frac{27}{4096} \\]\n\\[ P(X=3) = \\frac{540}{4096} = \\frac{135}{1024} \\]\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{135}{1024}}$.",
    "To find the probability of the pirate encountering exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps, we need to break it down into smaller parts.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of an island having treasure and not having traps. This is a combination of the probabilities of having treasure and not having traps: $\\frac{1}{4}$ (had treasure and no traps). Therefore, it is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nNext, we find the probability of an island having neither traps nor treasure. This is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nHowever, we're interested in islands that have treasure but not traps. So, the overall probability of an island being the desired type is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nNow, we need to choose 3 islands out of 6 that will have treasure and no traps. This can be done in $\\binom{6}{3} = 20$ ways, because there are 6 ways to choose the first island, 5 ways to choose the second island, and 4 ways to choose the third island. However, once these 3 islands are chosen, the remaining 3 islands must have neither traps nor treasure. The probability of an island having neither traps nor treasure is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of 3 islands having treasure and no traps, and the remaining 3 having neither traps nor treasure is $\\binom{6}{3} \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\times \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3$.\n\nSince the islands are independent of each other, we multiply the probabilities together:\n\n$\\binom{6}{3} \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\times \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3$\n$= 20 \\times \\frac{1}{64} \\time \\frac{8}{27}$\n$= \\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$"
