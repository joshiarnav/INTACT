    "To find the expected worth of a coin flip, we need to consider the probabilities and outcomes of the two possible flips.\n\n1. The probability of landing on heads is $\\frac34$.\n2. The probability of landing on tails is $\\frac14$.\n\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n\n* If the coin lands on heads, you gain $\\$3$.\n* If the coin lands on tails, you lose $\\$8$.\n\nTo find the expected worth, we multiply the probability of each outcome by the corresponding gain or loss, and then sum these products.\n\nExpected worth = (probability of heads * gain of heads) + (probability of tails * loss of tails)\n\nExpected worth = $(\\frac34 * 3) + (\\frac14 * -8)$\n\nExpected worth = $2.25 - 2$\n\nExpected worth = $0.25$\n\nSo, the expected worth of a coin flip is $\\boxed{0.25}$.",
    "To find the expected worth of a coin flip, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by its worth and then add the results.\n\nThe probability of heads is $\\frac{3}{4}$ and the worth of heads is $\\$3$. \n\nThe probability of tails is $\\frac{1}{4}$ and the worth of tails is $-\\$8$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected worth by multiplying these probabilities and worths, and then adding the results:\n\nExpected worth = (probability of heads) * (worth of heads) + (probability of tails) * (worth of tails)\n= $\\frac{3}{4} * \\$3 + \\frac{1}{4} * -\\$8$\n= $\\$2.25 - \\$2.00$\n= $\\$0.25$\n\nSo, the expected worth of a coin flip is $\\boxed{0.25}$.",
    "To find the expected worth of a coin flip, we need to consider both possible outcomes (heads and tails) and their corresponding probabilities, as well as the worth associated with each outcome.\n\n1. Probability of heads is $\\frac34$. The worth associated with heads is $\\$3$.\n\n2. Probability of tails is $\\frac14$. The worth associated with tails is $-\\$8$.\n\nNow, we multiply the probability of each outcome by its worth, and then we add both results to obtain the expected worth.\n\nExpected worth = $(\\frac{3}{4} \\times 3) + (\\frac{1}{4} \\times -8)$\n\nExpected worth = $(\\frac{9}{4}) + (\\frac{-8}{4})$\n\nExpected worth = $\\frac{9-8}{4}$\n\nExpected worth = $\\frac{1}{4}$\n\nExpected worth in dollars = $\\frac{1}{4} \\approx 0.25$ (rounded to the nearest hundredth)\n\nSo, the expected worth of a coin flip is $\\boxed{0.25}$."
