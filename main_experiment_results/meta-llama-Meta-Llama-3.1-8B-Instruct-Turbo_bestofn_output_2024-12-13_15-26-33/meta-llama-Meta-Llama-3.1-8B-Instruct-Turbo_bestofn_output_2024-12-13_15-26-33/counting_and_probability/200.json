    "To find the probability that Kim does not have a math test today, we need to subtract the probability that she does have a math test from 1. \n\nThe probability that Kim has a math test today is $\\frac{4}{7}$.\n\nSo, the probability that Kim does not have a math test today is $1 - \\frac{4}{7}$.\n\nTo subtract a fraction from 1, we can rewrite 1 as $\\frac{7}{7}$ (since the denominator is 7, which is the same as the denominator of the fraction $\\frac{4}{7}$).\n\nNow, we can subtract:\n\n$1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{7}{7} - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{7 - 4}{7} = \\frac{3}{7}$\n\nTherefore, the probability that Kim does not have a math test today is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$.",

So, we can write:\nProbability of having a math test = Probability of not having a math test\n$\\frac{4}{7}$ = Probability of not having a math test\n\nNow, we can solve for the probability of not having a math test by subtracting $\\frac{4}{7}$ from 1.\n\nFirst, we need to find a common denominator for 1.
