    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Visualize the square and the condition**: \n\nThe given square has vertices at (0,0), (0,2), (2,2), and (2,0). The condition is $x+y < 3$. To visualize this, let's think of the line $x+y = 3$, which is the boundary for our condition. This line passes through the points (3,0), (0,3), and (1.5,1.5).\n\n2. **Find the points where the line $x+y = 3$ intersects the square**:\n\nLooking at the square, we can see that the line $x+y = 3$ intersects the top side of the square at (2,1). It does not intersect at the right or left side but the bottom-right side is already outside of the square. So, we have a valid intersection at (2,1).\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the square**:\n\nThe area of the square is the length of one side squared. Since each side is 2 units long, the area is $2^2 = 4$ square units.\n\n4. **Calculate the area where $x+y < 3$**:\n\nThe area where $x+y < 3$ is the entire square minus the area of the triangle formed by the line $x+y = 3$ and the upper right vertex of the square (2,2).\n\n5. **Calculate the area of the triangle**:\n\nThe base of the triangle is 1 unit (from (2,1) to (2,2)), and the height is 1 unit (from (2,1) to (1.5,1.5) and then using the fact that line x+y=3 is a 45-degree angle triangle between those two points). So the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ square units.\n\n6. **Calculate the probability**:\n\nThe area where $x+y < 3$ is the area of the square minus the area of the triangle. So it's $4 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}$ square units.\n\nSince the point is chosen uniformly, the probability is equal to the ratio of the favorable area to the total area. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{\\frac{7}{2}}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$",
    "To find the probability that $x+y < 3$, we first need to visualize the given square and the line $x+y = 3$, which is the boundary for this condition. \n\nThe vertices of the square are given as (0,0), (0,2), (2,2), and (2,0). The line $x+y = 3$ passes through the points (3,0) and (0,3). \n\nLet's draw a line $x+y = 3$. The area in which $x+y < 3$ will be the area of the square excluding the triangle formed by the points (2,1), (2,2), and (1,2). \n\nTo calculate the probability, first, we need to find the area of the entire square and the area of the triangle.\n\nThe area of a square is calculated by $side \\times side$. Here, the side length is 2; hence the area of the square is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\nNow let's find the area of the triangle. A triangle's area is calculated by $\\frac{base \\times height}{2}$. Here, the base of the triangle is 1 (from 1 to 2 on the x-axis), and the height of the triangle is 1. So, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1 \\times 1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTo find the probability that $x+y < 3$, we subtract the area of the triangle from the area of the square and then divide it by the area of the square.\n\nProbability = Area of square - Area of triangle / Area of square\n\nProbability = ($4 - \\frac{1}{2}$) / 4 = ($\\frac{8-1}{2}$) / 4 = $\\frac{7}{2}$ / 4 = $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that $x+y < 3$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$.",
    "To find the probability that $x+y < 3$ for a randomly and uniformly chosen point $(x,y)$ inside the square, we need to determine the favorable outcomes (the region where $x+y < 3$) and the total possible outcomes (the entire square).\n\nStep 1: Find the total area of the square. \nThe length of the square is 4 units (from 0 to 2 on both x and y axes). So, the total area of the square is side \u00d7 side = $2^2 = 4$ square units.\n\nStep 2: Determine the region where $x+y < 3$. To visualize this, we draw a line $x+y = 3$. This line passes through (0,3) and (3,0). Since $x+y < 3$, we want all the points below this line.\n\nNow, if we draw this line and connect it with the points of the square, we get a new line segment that passes through the points (1,2), (2,1), and the vertices of the square. We will think about this line. The part where $x+y < 3$ is the entire square except the triangle in the upper right where $x + y > 3$.\n\nStep 3: Find the area of the triangle in the upper right.\nThe line $x+y = 3$ passes through the point (1,2) and (2,1). Therefore, the length of the base and height of the right-angled triangle is 1 (from 2 to 1 on both x and y axes). The area of this triangle can be calculated using the formula: $\\frac{1}{2} \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. Substituting the values, we get $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ square units.\n\nStep 4: Find the area of the region that satisfies $x + y < 3$.\nThe area of this region is the area of the square minus the area of the triangle. We calculated this in the previous steps: \nTotal area = 4 square units\nArea of triangle = $\\frac{1}{2}$ square units\nTherefore, the area that satisfies the inequality is $4 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}$ square units.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the probability.\nThe probability that the point $(x,y)$ satisfies the inequality $x+y < 3$ can be found by comparing the area of the favorable region to the total area. The probability is:\n\n$\\frac{\\text{Area of the region that satisfies the inequality}}{\\text{Total area of the square}}$\n$ = \\frac{\\frac{7}{2}}{4}$\n$ = \\frac{7}{8}$\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly and uniformly chosen point $(x,y)$ satisfies $x+y < 3$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$."
