    "To enclose a rectangular region, we need to choose two horizontal and two vertical lines. \n\nStep 1: Choose two horizontal lines out of four. This can be done in $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{24}{2*2} = 6$ ways.\n\nStep 2: Choose two vertical lines out of four. This can also be done in $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{24}{2*2} = 6$ ways.\n\nSince these choices are independent of each other, the total number of ways to choose four lines and enclose a rectangular region is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{36}$.",
    "To enclose a rectangular region, we need to choose two horizontal lines and two vertical lines. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Choosing horizontal lines**: We have 4 horizontal lines, and we need to choose 2 of them. We can choose the first line in 4 ways and the second line in 3 ways (since we can't choose the same line twice). However, since the order of choosing the lines doesn't matter (i.e., choosing line A first and line B second is the same as choosing line B first and line A second), we need to divide by 2 to avoid counting the same combination twice.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose two horizontal lines is $\\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\n\n2. **Choosing vertical lines**: Similarly, we have 4 vertical lines, and we need to choose 2 of them. The number of ways to choose two vertical lines is also $\\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\n\n3. **Combining the choices**: Since we have two independent choices (choosing horizontal lines and choosing vertical lines), we can multiply the number of ways to make each choice to get the total number of ways to enclose a rectangular region.\n\nSo, the total number of ways is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{36}$.",
    "To form a rectangle, we need to select two horizontal lines and two vertical lines. \n\nStep 1: Choosing two horizontal lines out of four. \nThe number of ways to choose 2 items out of 4 is given by combinations, which is denoted as C(4, 2) or \"4 choose 2\":\nC(4, 2) = (4!)/(2!*(4-2)!)\n= (4*3*2*1)/( 2*1 * (2*1) )\n= 6\n\nStep 2: Choosing two vertical lines out of four.\nSimilarly, we calculate \"4 choose 2\" to find the ways to choose the vertical lines:\nC(4, 2) = 6 (same as step 1, horizontally and vertically, the way of choosing the lines is the same.)\n\nStep 3: Multiplying the ways from step 1 and step 2 to find the total ways to form a rectangle.\nNumber of ways = 6 (from step 1) * 6 (from step 2) \n= 36 \n\nSo, there are 36 ways to choose four lines to enclose a rectangular region. \n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{36}$."

  "solution": "In order for the four lines to enclose a rectangular region, we must choose two horizontal and two vertical lines.  If we were to choose more than two of one of these types of lines, we would not be able to enclose any region.  We can count independently the number of ways to choose vertical and horizontal lines.  There will be $\\dbinom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose horizontal lines, and the same number of ways to choose two vertical lines.  Since these are independent, there are a total of $6\\cdot 6=\\boxed{36}$ ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle.",
