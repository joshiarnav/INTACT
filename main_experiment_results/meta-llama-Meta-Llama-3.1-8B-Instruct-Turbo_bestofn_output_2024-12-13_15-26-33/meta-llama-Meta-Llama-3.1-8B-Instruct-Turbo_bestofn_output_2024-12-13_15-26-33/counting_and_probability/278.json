  "problem": "After a gymnastics meet, each gymnast shook hands once with every gymnast on every team (except herself). Afterwards, a coach came down and only shook hands with each gymnast from her own team. There were a total of 281 handshakes. What is the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in?",

    "Let's break down the problem into manageable steps. \n\n1. **Gymnast-Gymnast Handshakes**: \n   Assume there are 'n' gymnasts, including both teams, not distinguishing between these teams yet. We'll deal with the team factor later. Each gymnast shakes hands with the rest, excluding themselves. If gymnast A shakes hands with 'n-1' gymnasts, and gymnast B also shakes hands with 'n-1' gymnasts, etc., because they each shake hands with the others, we must divide the total handshakes by two, as double counting occurs here. So, the total gymnast-gymnast handshakes would be $\\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}$.\n\n2. **Adding the Coach's Handshakes**:\n   Now, consider the coach only shook hands with the gymnasts from her own team. If the coach shook hands with 'c' of these gymnasts, there would be 'c' additional handshakes. \n\n3. **Combining Gymnast-Gymnast and Coach's Handshakes**:\n   Based on the total of 281 handshakes provided, and considering our gymnast-gymnast handshakes and the coach's handshakes, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2} + c = 281 \\]\n\nGiven that there is an even number of gymnasts, because handshakes must be whole numbers, we solve for $n(n-1)$ which can help determine n, which is a whole number.\n\n \n   The least 'n' that solves $n(n - 1) = 562$ is 24 (obtained using guess-and-check). So, we know 'n' must be 24.\n\n   Therefore,  $c = 281 - \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}$\n\n   Finally, calculate this using n = 24 (this matches our guess of the least number of gymnasts).\n\n   c = $281 - \\frac{24(24 - 1)}{2}$\n   $= 281 - \\frac{24(23)}{2}$\n   $= 281 - 276$\n   $= 5$\n\nSo, the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "Let's denote the number of gymnasts as 'n'. Since each gymnast shook hands once with every other gymnast (except herself), the number of handshakes between gymnasts is the total number of ways we can choose two gymnasts, which is given by the combination formula: \n\nnC2 = n(n-1)/2 \n\nThe number of handshakes between the coach and the gymnasts from her own team is at least 1 (the handshake with herself, though in this case the coach speaking with her own gymnast self is not being added, speaking here hypothetically), since the problem suggests that the coach may have shaken hands only with one gymnast from her team. Let's assume the number of handshakes between the coach and the gymnasts from her own team is 'k'.\n\nGiven that there were a total of 281 handshakes: \n\nn(n-1)/2 + k = 281 \n\nWe want to find the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in, which is 'k'. To minimize 'k', we need to maximize 'n' such that n(n-1)/2 is close to 281, and still a whole number.\n\nTo maximize 'n', let's try values of 'n' until we find a value where n(n-1)/2 is close to 281 and gives us a whole number.\n\nTrying n = 23: \n23(23-1)/2 = 23*22/2 = 253 \n\nThis value is less than 281.\n\nTrying n = 24: \n24(24-1)/2 = 24*23/2 = 276 \n\nThis value is still less than 281 but closer.\n\nTrying n = 25: \n25(25-1)/2 = 25*24/2 = 300 \n\nThis value is greater than 281.\n\nTrying n = 24, we have n(n-1)/2 = 276 (as calculated above), and we need to find an integer value for 'k' such that: \n\n276 + k = 281 \n\nTo find the value of 'k', we subtract 276 from 281:\n\nk = 281 - 276 \nk = 5\n\nTherefore, the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in is:\n\n$\\boxed{5}$."

  "critique": "The best solution is 1 and 2, however, since you asked for the index number, I will choose the lower index number, which is 1.",
  "solution": "The number of gymnasts is some integer $n$, so that the number of gymnast-gymnast handshakes is ${n \\choose 2}$ for some $n$. Also, the coach must participate in an integer $k<n$ number of handshakes. So, ${n \\choose 2} + k = 281$. If we want to minimize $k$, we need the maximal $n$ such that ${n \\choose 2} \\le 281$, which implies $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 281$ or $n^2 - n - 562 \\le 0 $. So, the maximal $n$ is 24. So, $k = 281 - {24 \\choose 2} = 281 - 12 \\cdot 23 = 281 - 276 = \\boxed{5}$.",
