    "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $7!$ and $(5!)^2$, we first need to expand these expressions.\n\nFirst, let's find $7!$: \n$7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040$\n\nNow, let's find $(5!)^2$: \n$(5!)^2 = (5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1)^2 = 120^2 = 14400$\n\nNext, let's factorize both numbers to find their prime factors:\n$5040 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7$\n$14400 = 2^6 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2$\n\nTo find the GCD, we take the minimum power of each common prime factor from both factorizations.\nThe common prime factors are $2$, $3$, and $5$. The minimum power of $2$ is $2^4$, the minimum power of $3$ is $3^2$, and the minimum power of $5$ is $5^1$.\n\nTherefore, the GCD is: \n$2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 = 720$\n\nSo, the GCD is $\\boxed{720}$.",
