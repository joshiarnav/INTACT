    "To find the probability that William will get at least one of the final four questions right, we will first find the probability that he gets all four questions wrong. \n\nThe probability that he gets one question wrong is $\\frac{4}{5}$, since there are four incorrect options out of five. \n\nThe probability that he gets all four questions wrong is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4$.\n\nThe probability that he gets at least one question right is the opposite of getting all questions wrong. \n\nTherefore, the probability that William will get at least one of the final four questions right is $1 - \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4$.\n\nNow, let's calculate this value:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = \\frac{256}{625}$\n\n$1 - \\frac{256}{625} = \\frac{625}{625} - \\frac{256}{625} = \\frac{369}{625}$\n\nSo, the probability that William will get at least one of the final four questions right is $\\boxed{\\frac{369}{625}}$.",
    "To solve this, let's first find the probability of William getting all 4 questions wrong, and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability of him getting at least one right.\n\nSince each question has 5 answer choices, the probability of William getting a question wrong is $\\frac{4}{5}$, as there are 4 incorrect choices out of 5.\n\nThe probability of William getting all 4 questions wrong is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = \\frac{256}{625}$.\n\nNow, let's subtract this from 1 to find the probability of him getting at least one right:\n\n$1 - \\frac{256}{625} = \\frac{369}{625}$\n\nSo, the probability that William will get at least one of these final four questions right is $\\boxed{\\frac{369}{625}}$.",
    "To find the probability that William will get at least one of the final four questions right, we first need to understand the total possible outcomes and the probability of getting each question right.\n\nEach question has five answer choices, so the probability of getting any single question right is 1/5, and the probability of getting it wrong is 4/5.\n\nNow, let's consider the probability of getting all four questions wrong, which will give us the complement of the probability we want to find.\n\nThe probability of getting all four questions wrong is: \n(Probability of getting a question wrong) ^ 4\n= (4/5)^4\n\n= 256/625\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least one question right is the complement of this probability, which is:\n1 - 256/625\n= (625 - 256) / 625\n= 369/625\n\nTherefore, the probability that William will get at least one of the final four questions right is $\\boxed{369/625}$."

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and yield the same result.

  "solution": "We find the probability that William misses the last four questions, and subtract from 1.
