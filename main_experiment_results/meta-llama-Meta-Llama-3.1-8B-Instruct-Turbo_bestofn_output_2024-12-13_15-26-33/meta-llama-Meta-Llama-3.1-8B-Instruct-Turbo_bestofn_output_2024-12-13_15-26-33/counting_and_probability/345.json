    "To find the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers selected from the first seven prime numbers is an even number, we need to consider all possible pairs.\n\nThe first seven prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\nIf we want the sum of two numbers to be even, we must select either two even numbers or two odd numbers since the sum of any odd and even number will be odd.\n\nSince there is only one even prime number (2) in the given list, it is impossible to form a pair of two even prime numbers.\n\nHowever, we can select two odd prime numbers from the remaining six odd prime numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17). \n\nNow we need to determine the number of possible pairs of two distinct odd prime numbers. We can use the combination formula C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2 to calculate it: \n\nC(6,2) = 6(6-1)/2\n= 6(5)/2\n= 15\n\nNow we also need to find the total number of possible pairs (distinct numbers) we can form from 7 prime numbers. We can use the combination formula C(7,2) = 7(7-1)/2 to calculate it:\nC(7,2) = 7(6)/2\n= 21\n\nThus, the probability of two distinct numbers selected at random from the first seven prime numbers having an even sum is the ratio of the number of pairs of distinct prime numbers that sum to an even number to the total number of possible pairs of distinct numbers, which is:\n\n15/21 = 5/7\n\nSo, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",
    "To find the probability that the sum of two distinct prime numbers is even, we first need to find the total number of pairs that can be formed and the number of pairs that result in an even sum.\n\nThe first seven prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\nThe total number of distinct pairs that can be formed from 7 distinct numbers is 7C2 = (7 * 6) / 2 = 21.\n\nFor a pair of numbers to have an even sum, both numbers must be even or both must be odd. \n\nSince there is only one even prime number (2) among the first seven primes, there are 6 odd prime numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17).\n\nThere are 0 ways to pair the even prime number with itself, since the numbers must be distinct.\nThere are 6 ways to pair the even prime number (2) with the 6 odd prime numbers (6 * 1 = 6 pairs).\nThere are 6C2 = (6 * 5) / 2 = 15 ways to pair the 6 odd prime numbers with each other.\n\nSo, the total number of pairs that result in an even sum is 6 + 15 = 21 - 0 = 21.\n\nHowever, given 2 * 11 + 3 * 5 is an example of odd sums - and given we looked at all cases - (in fact  given  2 * each of the odds gives 2 * odd +2 + 2 * odd; that means 2 more makes 2 * odd + an even, then now that doesn't count towards even, to recalculate given the set and sums) we find  21 - 6 = 15 should be the number of good sums.\n\nThe probability that the sum is an even number is then 15/21.\n\nThis can be simplified to 5/7.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$."

  "solution": "The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2. There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum IS even is $1-\\frac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",
