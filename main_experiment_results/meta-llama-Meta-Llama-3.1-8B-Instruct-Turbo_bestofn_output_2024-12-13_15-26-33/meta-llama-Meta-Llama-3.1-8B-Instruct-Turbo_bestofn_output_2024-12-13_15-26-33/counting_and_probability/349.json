    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into manageable steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total possible outcomes**: Since Anna flips 8 coins, each coin has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails). Therefore, the total number of outcomes for 8 coins is 2^8 = 256.\n\n2. **Determine the favorable outcomes**: We want to find the number of outcomes where Anna gets more heads than tails. This means we need at least 5 heads (since 4 heads and 4 tails would be an equal number). To count these outcomes, we calculate the number of combinations for 5, 6, 7, and 8 heads.\n\n   - 5 heads: The number of combinations is C(8, 5) = 56.\n   - 6 heads: The number of combinations is C(8, 6) = 28.\n   - 7 heads: The number of combinations is C(8, 7) = 8.\n   - 8 heads: The number of combinations is C(8, 8) = 1.\n\n   We add these numbers together to get the total favorable outcomes: 56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 93.\n\n3. **Calculate the probability**: Now we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total possible outcomes.\n\n   Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes)\n   Probability = 93 / 256\n\n   Therefore, the probability that Anna gets more heads than tails is 93/256 = 0.36328125.\n\nSince you requested that the answer be in the format $\\boxed{answer}$, here is the answer in decimal form rounded to 6 decimal places:\n\n$\\boxed{0.363281}$",
    "To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of binomial probability. \n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of possible outcomes when Anna flips 8 coins. Each coin can be either heads (H) or tails (T), so for 8 coins, there are:\n\n2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 256\n\npossible outcomes.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where Anna gets more heads than tails. To do this, we can count the outcomes where she gets 5 heads, 6 heads, 7 heads, or 8 heads.\n\nThe number of ways to get exactly 5 heads is:\n\n8C5 = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 56\n\nThe number of ways to get exactly 6 heads is:\n\n8C6 = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3) / (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 28\n\nThe number of ways to get exactly 7 heads is:\n\n8C7 = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2) / (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 8\n\nThe number of ways to get exactly 8 heads is:\n\n8C8 = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 1\n\nNow, let's add these numbers together to get the total number of outcomes where Anna gets more heads than tails:\n\n56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 93\n\nThe probability of Anna getting more heads than tails is therefore:\n\n93/256\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.\n\nSo the fraction 93/256 is already in its simplest form.\n\nHowever, this fraction represents the probability as a fraction. We were asked for a boxed answer which is traditionally a decimal, but we'll provide a simplified fraction answer (to keep compatibility with the request). \n\nSo the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{93}{256}}$."

  "solution": "We could solve this problem using casework, but using a little bit of symmetry and complementary probability gives us a more elegant solution. Since each coin flips heads and tails with equal probability, by the principle of symmetry the probability of getting more heads than tails is the equal to the probability of getting more tails than heads. Additionally, there are only three possible outcomes: getting more heads than tails, getting more tails than heads, or getting the same number of both. If we let $x$ represent the probability of the first outcome (which is the same as the probability of the second outcome) and $y$ represent the probability of the third outcome, we get the equation $2x + y = 1 \\Rightarrow x=\\dfrac{1-y}{2}$. So all we need to do is calculate the probability of getting the same number of heads and tails and we can then easily solve for what we want using the principle of complementary probability. Since there are two equally likely outcomes for each flip, there are a total of $2^8$ equally likely possible outcomes for flipping the 8 coins. We will have the same number of both heads and tails if we have exactly 4 of each, which we can count by selecting 4 out of the 8 flips to be heads which can occur in $\\binom{8}{4}=70$ ways. So $y=\\dfrac{70}{256}=\\dfrac{35}{128}$, and substituting that back into our first equation gives us the probability that we want: $x=\\boxed{\\dfrac{93}{256}}$.",
