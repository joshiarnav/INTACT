  "all_solutions": [
    "To find the number of ways to form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats, we need to calculate the combinations separately for Republicans and Democrats, then multiply the results.\n\nStep 1: Calculating combinations for Republicans\nWe have 8 Republicans and we need to choose 3 of them. This can be calculated using the combination formula: \n\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and '!' denotes factorial. So, \n\n8C3 = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!)\n= 8! / (3! * 5!)\n= (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n= 56\n\nStep 2: Calculating combinations for Democrats\nWe have 6 Democrats and we need to choose 2 of them. Using the same combination formula: \n\n6C2 = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!)\n= 6! / (2! * 4!)\n= (6 * 5) / (2 * 1)\n= 15\n\nStep 3: Multiply the combinations for Republicans and Democrats\nTo find the total number of ways to form the subcommittee, we multiply the combinations for Republicans and Democrats: \n\nTotal combinations = 8C3 * 6C2\n= 56 * 15\n= 840\n\nTherefore, there are 840 ways to form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats.\n\n$\\boxed{840}$",
    "To solve this problem, we will use combinations, as the order of selection doesn't matter.\n\n**Step 1:** Form a subcommittee of 3 Republicans from 8 Republicans\nThe number of ways to select 3 Republicans from 8 is calculated by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nFor Republicans: C(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1) = 56\n\n**Step 2:** Form a subcommittee of 2 Democrats from 6 Democrats\nThe number of ways to select 2 Democrats from 6 is similarly calculated\n\nFor Democrats: C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = (6*5) / (2*1) = 15\n\n**Step 3:** Find the total number of ways to form the subcommittee by multiplying the number of ways to form the Republican subcommittee and the number of ways to form the Democratic subcommittee (as these selections are independent of each other)\nTotal number of ways = Number of ways to select 3 Republicans * Number of ways to select 2 Democrats = 56 * 15 = 840\n\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is: $\\boxed{840}$",
    "To form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats from a Senate committee with 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, we need to consider the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats separately and then multiply them together.\n\nStep 1: Choose 3 Republicans out of 8.\nThe number of ways to choose 3 Republicans out of 8 can be calculated using combinations, which is denoted by 'n choose r' or C(n, r), and is equal to n! / [r! * (n-r)!]. Here, n is the total number of elements, r is the number of elements to choose, and '!' denotes factorial.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans out of 8 is C(8, 3) = 8! / [3! * (8-3)!] = 8! / (3! * 5!) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 56.\n\nStep 2: Choose 2 Democrats out of 6.\nSimilar to Step 1, the number of ways to choose 2 Democrats out of 6 is C(6, 2) = 6! / [2! * (6-2)!] = 6! / (2! * 4!) = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1) = 15.\n\nStep 3: Multiply the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats.\nThe total number of ways to form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats is the product of the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats. So, the total number of ways is 56 * 15 = 840.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{840}.$"
