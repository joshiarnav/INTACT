    "To find the number of different possible pairs of people that Cara could be sitting between, we need to consider the total number of ways to choose 2 people from a group of 5, since the two people on either side of Cara will form a pair.\n\nThere are $\\binom{5}{2} = \\dfrac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\dfrac{5*4}{2*1} = 10$ ways to choose 2 people from the group of 5.\n\nHowever, in the context of the seating arrangement at the circular table, each of these pairs would be counted twice if we simply find the combinations, since swapping the two people in a pair would yield the same pair. For example, if Cara is sitting between A and B, swapping A and B doesn't yield a new pair.\n\nTo account for this, we can divide by the number of ways to rearrange the 2 people in a pair, which is $2! = 2$.\n\nBut we then have to multiply by $2$, because there are $2$ different sides - either from the left, or from the right. Each side represents a different pairing of { person1, person2 }.\n\nHowever we simply just acknowledge that these pairings are present regardless of direction since a pair is just a pair. Hence simply use the formula $\\dfrac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}$. The total number of different possible pairs of people that Cara could be sitting between is $\\boxed{10}.$",
    "To find out how many different possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between, we can first consider that there are five friends in total and the places where Cara could be sitting between are fixed. \n\nSince there are five friends and two places on either side of Cara, we can choose either 2 friends from 5 or simply put them in pairs. \n\nChoosing two friends from five can be calculated using the combinations formula, $\\binom{n}{k}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items and $k$ is the number of items to choose. \n\nApplying this to our situation, we get:\n\n$\\binom{5}{2}=\\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!}=\\frac{5\\times 4 \\times 3!}{2! \\times 3!} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$\n\nSo, there are 10 different possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between. \n\n$\\boxed{10}$",
    "To find the number of possible pairs of people that Cara could be sitting between, we need to consider the total number of arrangements between Cara and her five friends, since the table is circular.\n\nWhen we are calculating the number of pairings of objects arranged in a circle, we use the formula (n-1), where n is the total number of elements. However, in this problem, we're dealing with pairs of distinct people from the group of five, with one person already chosen (Cara) and being seated by the other person in a pair.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of pairs between Cara and her friends. There are 5 people that could be sitting on the left side, and 4 choices for the person on the right side, resulting in 5 * 4 possible pairings.\n\nHowever, considering that such pairs are indistinguishable since the table is circular, and we only need to consider one side of the pair (given that every pair that would be to the left is just a rotation of its partner pair with its partner being one position to the right) we should instead consider this as a combination problem.\n\nSince there will be 4 people left of Cara and 4 people to the right, there will be 4 pairs of people. \n\nSo the total number of pairs would be:\n\n4 * 2 (for left and right of Cara) \n= 8 pairings.\n\nTherefore, the number of different possible pairs of people that Cara could be sitting between is 8.\n\n$\\boxed{8}$"
