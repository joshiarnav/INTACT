    "To find the total number of different positive, four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9, we need to consider the concept of permutations with repetition.\n\nStep 1: We have a total of 4 digits, but two of them are repeated twice (2 and 9).\n\nStep 2: If all the digits were distinct, the number of possible arrangements would be 4!. However, due to the repetition, we need to adjust for the overcounting.\n\nStep 3: To do this, we divide the total number of permutations by the factorials of the repetition counts for each digit. In this case, we have two pairs of repeated digits (2 and 9), so we divide by 2! twice.\n\nStep 4: The formula for permutations with repetition becomes 4! / (2! * 2!), where \"!\" denotes the factorial.\n\nStep 5: Calculating the factorials, we have 4! = 24, 2! = 2, and another 2! = 2.\n\nStep 6: Plugging in these values, we get 24 / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the total number of different positive, four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9 is 6.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "To find the total number of different positive, four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9, let's break down the process step by step.\n\n1. Place the thousands digit: There are two options for the thousands digit - 2 or 9. So, there are 2 choices.\n\n2. Place the hundreds digit: Once the thousands digit is chosen, there are three digits left. However, two of those digits are the same (either two 2s or two 9s). If the thousands digit is a 2, then there are 2 options for the hundreds digit (2 or 9). The same goes for when the thousands digit is a 9.\n\n3. Place the tens digit: After placing the hundreds digit, there are two digits left. Since two of the digits in this group are the same, there is 1 option for the tens digit.\n\n4. Place the ones digit: At this point, there is only one digit left, so there is 1 option for the ones digit.\n\nHowever, because the two choices for the thousands digit (2 or 9) lead to different outcomes of the hundreds digit number of choices, the total number of choices will need to multiply the choices for the hundreds digit with the choices for the thousands digit since those numbers will yield a different outcome. As for this, since the choices for the hundreds digit are 2 in each of the two cases, this will lead to 2 x 2 = 4 choices.\n\nNow, multiply the number of options at each step to get the total number of different positive, four-digit integers that can be formed.\n\nSo, the total number of different positive, four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9 is 4.\n\n$\\boxed{4}$"

  "solution": "We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting. That is, if we had 4 distinct digits, there would be $4! = 24$ orderings. However, we must divide by 2! once for the repetition of the digit 2, and divide by 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digit were different we would have twice as many orderings). So, our answer is $\\frac{4!}{2!\\cdot 2!} = 2 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{6}$.",
