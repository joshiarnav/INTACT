    "To find the number of three-digit numbers left, we need to find the total number of three-digit numbers and subtract the number of three-digit numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent.\n\n1. **Total number of three-digit numbers:**\n   A three-digit number can have any digit from 1 to 9 in the hundreds place, and any digit from 0 to 9 in the tens and units place. Since the leading digit cannot be zero, it has 9 options (1 to 9), and the other two digits have 10 options each (0 to 9).\n   So, the total number of three-digit numbers is 9 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 = 900.\n\n2. **Number of three-digit numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent:**\n   To find this, we can consider three cases:\n   a. **Case 1:** The first and last digits are the same, and the middle digit is different.\n      There are 9 choices for the repeated digit (1 to 9). For the middle digit, there are 9 choices (since it cannot be the repeated digit).\n      So, there are 9 \u00d7 9 = 81 numbers in this case.\n\n   b. **Case 2:** The first and middle digits are the same, and the last digit is different.\n      Since the repeated digit cannot be zero (as it's the first and middle digits), there are 9 choices for the repeated digit (1 to 9).\n      For the last digit, there are 9 choices (since it cannot be the repeated digit).\n      So, there are 9 \u00d7 9 = 81 numbers in this case.\n\n   c. **Case 3:** The middle and last digits are the same, and the first digit is different.\n      There are 9 choices for the repeated digit (1 to 9).\n      For the first digit, there are 9 choices (since it cannot be the repeated digit).\n      So, there are 9 \u00d7 9 = 81 numbers in this case.\n\n   Total number of three-digit numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent, is 81 + 81 + 81 = 243.\n\n3. **Final answer:**\n   Number of three-digit numbers left is the total number of three-digit numbers minus the number of three-digit numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent.\n   Number of three-digit numbers left is 900 - 243 = 657.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{657}$",
    "To find the total number of three-digit numbers, we first consider all the possible combinations for the hundreds, tens, and ones places. \n\n- Since the numbers are three-digit, the hundreds place cannot be 0. It can be filled with any of the 9 digits from 1 to 9.\n\n- The tens place can be filled with any of the 10 digits from 0 to 9.\n\n- The ones place can also be filled with any of the 10 digits from 0 to 9.\n\nUsing the multiplication principle, the total number of three-digit numbers is $9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 = 900$.\n\nNow, let's find how many numbers have exactly two digits the same but not adjacent. \n\n- We can consider the three-digit numbers as consisting of the form xyz.\n\n- If the first and third digits are the same, then they can be the same from the 9 digits (1 to 9), and the middle digit can be anything from 0 to 9. Therefore, we have $9 \\cdot 9 = 81$ possibilities.\n\nSo, the total number of three-digit numbers with exactly two digits the same but not adjacent is 81.\n\nThe number of three-digit numbers left, excluding those with exactly two digits the same but not adjacent, is $900 - 81 = 819$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{819}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of three-digit numbers. \n\nA three-digit number can have any digit from 1 to 9 in the hundreds place (since we exclude numbers starting with 0). \nThe tens place can have any digit from 0 to 9, and the ones place can have any digit from 0 to 9.\nSo, the total number of three-digit numbers is 9 * 10 * 10 = 900.\n\nNext, let's find the number of three-digit numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent.\n\nIf the first digit (hundreds place) and the third digit (ones place) are the same, the second digit (tens place) can be any digit except the same number, so it can be 9 different digits. \nWhen the second and the third digit are the same, the first digit must be different (since they are not adjacent). \nSo, in this case, the first digit can be 9 digits (any digit except the same number of the three). \nAlso, the hundreds place is any of 1-9 since the case can't include a zero.\n\nWhile looking for digits the same, that are not adjacent, we know that the first digit can be any of these 9 since we already determined this before. \nNow after we've established this the second digit must match the third digit (making the three digits not each unique) to fit the problem statement. The first digit will be the same as the hundreds digit as well (to stay the same and keep from being adjacent) and the third must be the same as the others so we have now picked 3 of the numbers in the three digit. \n\nConsidering all these, we count the numbers that have exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent. \nIf the hundreds digit is 1-9 (9 possibilities) and the tens place digit and the ones place digit are the same (9 possibilities for the two digits since you've picked 3 out of the 3 digits so you must have a repeat) then 9 * 9 = 81.\n\nHowever, since we need the two identical digits to be non-adjacent and we have no repeats other than in the three spots picked and there are three sets of non-adjacent digits for every set picked, so we must multiply by 3, because for each 3 digit we can have thousands, units and hundreds as our numbers which makes the total 3 possible sets and the total number of these type of numbers is 3 * 81 = 243.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of three-digit numbers left after excluding all three-digit numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent. \nIt's the total number of three-digit numbers minus the number of three-digit numbers that have exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent.\n\nSo, the number of three-digit numbers left is 900 - 243 = 657.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{657}$."
