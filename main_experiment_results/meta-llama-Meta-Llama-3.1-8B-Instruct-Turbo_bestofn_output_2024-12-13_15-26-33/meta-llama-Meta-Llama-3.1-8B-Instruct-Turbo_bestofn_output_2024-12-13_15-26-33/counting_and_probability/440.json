    "To find the probability that $x+y \\le 4$, we need to determine the ratio of the area where $x+y \\le 4$ to the total area of the given rectangle.\n\nThe given rectangle has a base length of 3 and a height of 6, so its total area is:\n\nArea = base length \u00d7 height\n= 3 \u00d7 6\n= 18\n\nThe region where $x+y \\le 4$ is a trapezoid within the rectangle. To find the area of this trapezoid, we can calculate the areas of the individual triangles and the smaller rectangle, then add them together.\n\nFirst, we'll find the area of the triangle above the line $y = 4-x$. This triangle's base length is 4, and its height is 1. The area of this triangle is:\n\nArea = (base length + height) \u00d7 base height / 2\n= (4 + 1) \u00d7 1 / 2\n= 5 / 2\n= 2.5\n\nThe next triangle has a base length of 1 and a height of 1, so its area is:\n\nArea = (base length + height) \u00d7 base height / 2\n= (1 + 1) \u00d7 1 / 2\n= 1\n\nFinally, the total area of the region where $x+y \\le 4$ is the sum of the areas of these two triangles and the smaller rectangle:\n\nTotal area = 2.5 + 1 + 0.5\n= 4\n\nThe probability that $x+y \\le 4$ is the ratio of the area of this region to the total area of the rectangle:\n\nProbability = Total area of region / Total area of rectangle\n= 4 / 18\n= 2 / 9\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{9}}$.",
    "To find the probability that $x+y \\le 4$, we need to understand the region where this condition holds. \n\nGiven the constraints $0 \\le x \\le 3$ and $0 \\le y \\le 6$, the total area of the region is a rectangle with dimensions 3 (width) and 6 (length), giving an area of $3 \\times 6 = 18$. \n\nNow, let's find the region where $x+y \\le 4$. This region is a trapezoid with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 4), (3, 1), and (3, 0). \n\nWe can calculate the area of this trapezoid using the formula for the area of a trapezoid: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (a + b) \\times h$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the parallel sides, and $h$ is the height.\n\nIn this case, $a$ is the length of the base (between (0, 0) and (3, 0)), which is 3. $b$ is the length of the top (between (0, 4) and (3, 1)), which is $4 - 1 = 3$. $h$ is the distance between the parallel sides, which is 3.\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (3 + 3) \\times 3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that the randomly selected point lies within the trapezoid by taking the ratio of the area of the trapezoid to the area of the rectangle. \n\nProbability = (Area of trapezoid) / (Area of rectangle) = $9 / 18 = 1/2$.\n\nSo, the probability is $\\boxed{1/2}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's visualize it and break it down step by step.\n\n1. The given constraints are:\n   - $0 \\le x \\le 3$\n   - $0 \\le y \\le 6$\n\n2. The inequality we want to satisfy is:\n   - $x + y \\le 4$\n\n3. We can rearrange this inequality to isolate y:\n   - $y \\le -x + 4$\n\n4. This inequality describes the region below the line $y = -x + 4$.\n\n5. To find the area where $0 \\le x \\le 3$ and $0 \\le y \\le 6$, let's calculate the area of the total region.\n   - The total region is a rectangle with a base of 3 and a height of 6.\n   - The area of this rectangle is $3 \\times 6 = 18$ square units.\n\n6. Now, let's find the area of the region that satisfies the inequality $x+y \\le 4$.\n   - The line $y = -x + 4$ intersects the x-axis (y=0) at (4,0).\n   - However, since $0 \\le x \\le 3$, we want to find the intersection of the line $y=-x+4$ with the line $x=3$.\n   - Substituting $x = 3$ into the equation $y = -x + 4$ gives:\n     - $y = -3 + 4$\n     - $y = 1$\n   - This intersection point is (3,1).\n   - The bounded region that satisfies the inequality $x+y \\le 4$ is a trapezoid.\n\n   - Find the area of the trapezoid:\n     - The trapezoid has bases of length 4 (horizontal line at y=0) and 1 (horizontal line at y=1), and a height of 3.\n     - The formula for the area of a trapezoid is: $\\frac{(b1 + b2) \\times h}{2}$\n     - Substituting the values, we get:\n     - $\\frac{(4 + 1) \\times 3}{2}$\n     - $\\frac{15}{2}$\n     - $7.5$\n\n7. The probability that $x+y \\le 4$ can be found by dividing the area of the region that satisfies the inequality by the total area.\n   - Probability = $\\frac{\\text{Area of the trapezoid}}{\\text{Total area}}$\n   - However, for the region in question (in the picture that the problem statement implicitly describes) we want the area of the trapezoid between the line $y=-x+4$, the x-axis, and the vertical line at x=3. The top of the trapezoid should be at y value=4, (because it's a line formed by the inequality and for the triangle the upper value will work). This new problem (instead of cut off the top off at y=1) can be visualized by \n   - Integrating the line $y=-x+4$ from x=0 to x=3 \n   - -To find the area of the triangle between the x-axis (y=0), y=-x+4, and the x=3 the integral can be:\n     - $\\int_{0}^{3} -x+4 \\,dx$\n       - $ \\left[-\\frac{x^2}{2}+4x\\right]_{x=0}^{x=3}$\n       - $-\\frac{9}{2} + 12$\n       - $\\frac{15}{2}$\n       - Using this method we find the area of the trapezoid bounded between the line y=-x+4, x=0 and the line x=3 \n          for the triangle the upper value will work. The area between the line y=-x+4, and the line at x=3 is  $\\frac{15}{2}$. So the area below the line and to the right of the x=3 is cut off at y=4 value and for the region in question (I implicitly describe in the visuals) cut off at the line y=-x+4 and x=3 we will use the unilateral area cut off at y=4 value, \n   - The total area is 18.\n   - The probability that $x+y \\le 4$ can be found by dividing the area of the region that satisfies the inequality by the total area.\n   - Probability = $\\frac{\\text{Total area of the triangle}+\\text{Area of the trapezoid}}{\\text{Total area}}$\n   - The total area of the triangle is $\\frac{3 \\times 4}{2} = 6$.\n   - Therefore, the area that satisfies the inequality is $6 + \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{15}{2}$.\n   - The probability that $x+y \\le 4$ is $\\frac{\\frac{15}{2} + 6}{18}$.\n   - This probability is $\\frac{\\frac{15}{2} + 6}{18} = \\frac{\\frac{15}{2} + \\frac{12}{2}}{18} = \\frac{\\frac{27}{2}}{18}$\n       - Therefore, the probability that $x+y \\le 4$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{18}}$"
