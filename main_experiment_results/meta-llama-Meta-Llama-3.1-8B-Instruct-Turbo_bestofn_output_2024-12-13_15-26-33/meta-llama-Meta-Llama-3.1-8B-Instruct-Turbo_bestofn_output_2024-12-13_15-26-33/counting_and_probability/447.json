    "To find the number of ways Karl can select four crayons from 12, we can use the concept of combinations. Since the order doesn't matter, we're looking for the number of combinations of 12 items taken 4 at a time.\n\nThe formula for combinations is given by:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r! \\* (n - r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (12), r is the number of items to be chosen (4), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 \\* 4 \\* 3 \\* 2 \\* 1).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! \\* (12 - 4)!)\n= 12! / (4! \\* 8!)\n= (12 \\* 11 \\* 10 \\* 9 \\* 8!) / ((4 \\* 3 \\* 2 \\* 1) \\* 8!)\n= (12 \\* 11 \\* 10 \\* 9) / (4 \\* 3 \\* 2 \\* 1)\n= 11880 / 24\n= 495\n\nTherefore, there are 495 ways Karl can select four crayons from 12 without considering the order of selection.\n\n$\\boxed{495}$",
    "To find the number of ways Karl can select four crayons from the box, we need to use the concept of combinations.\n\nStep 1: Identify the number of items (n) and the number of items to be selected (r). \nIn this case, n = 12 (total number of crayons) and r = 4 (number of crayons to be selected).\n\nStep 2: Use the combination formula to find the number of ways to select the crayons.\nThe combination formula is given by:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n\nwhere n! represents the factorial of n (i.e., n \u00d7 (n-1) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1).\n\nStep 3: Plug in the values of n and r into the combination formula:\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * (12-4)!)\n\nStep 4: Simplify the expression:\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * 8!)\n= (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!) / ((4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) \u00d7 (8!))\n= (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)\n= 11880 / 24\n= 495\n\nTherefore, the number of ways Karl can select four crayons is:\n\n$\\boxed{495}$",
    "To find the number of ways Karl can select four crayons from a box of 12, we can use the concept of combinations.\n\nStep 1: Understand that the order does not matter, so we are dealing with combinations, not permutations.\n\nStep 2: Identify the total number of items (crayons) n = 12. \n\nStep 3: Identify the number of items Karl is going to choose or select r = 4. \n\nStep 4: The formula for combinations is C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!) \n\nStep 5: Plug the values into the formula:\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * (12 - 4)!)\n\nStep 6: Simplify the expression:\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * 8!)\n\nStep 7: Cancel out common terms in the factorials:\nC(12, 4) = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nStep 8: Perform the multiplication:\nC(12, 4) = 11880 / 24\n\nStep 9: Perform the division:\nC(12, 4) = 495\n\nSo, there are $\\boxed{495}$ ways Karl can select four crayons from the box if the order does not matter."

  "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",
