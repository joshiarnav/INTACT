  "problem": "A soccer team has $22$ available players. A fixed set of $11$ players starts the game, while the other $11$ are available as substitutes. During the game, the coach may make as many as $3$ substitutions, where any one of the $11$ players in the game is replaced by one of the substitutes. No player removed from the game may reenter the game, although a substitute entering the game may be replaced later. No two substitutions can happen at the same time. The players involved and the order of the substitutions matter. Let $n$ be the number of ways the coach can make substitutions during the game (including the possibility of making no substitutions). Find the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$.\n",

    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into manageable steps. \n\n**Step 1: Consider the number of ways for zero substitutions**\n\nThe coach can choose to make zero substitutions, which only has one way (i.e., do nothing). This gives us our base case for calculations.\n\n**Step 2: Consider the number of ways for one substitution**\n\nThere are 11 possibilities for which player the coach decides to replace. This choice determines the remaining 10 players who continue playing. For each of these 11 possibilities, there are 11 choices for the substitute. Therefore, this results in $11 \\times 11 = 121$ possibilities.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the number of ways for two substitutions**\n\nThere are 11 possibilities for the first player to be replaced. This choice determines the remaining 10 players who continue playing. For each of these 11 possibilities, there are 11 choices for the first substitute, and then 10 choices for the second substitute. This choice of the first substitute determines which 10 players continue playing. Therefore, this results in $11 \\times 11 \\times 10 = 1 \\ 210$ possibilities.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the number of ways for three substitutions**\n\nThere are 11 possibilities for the first player to be replaced. This choice determines the remaining 10 players who continue playing. For each of these 11 possibilities, there are 11 choices for the first substitute, then 10 choices for the second substitute, and then 9 choices for the third substitute. However, each of these choices determines which 9 players continue playing with the first substitute, then which 8 players continue playing with the second substitute, and finally which 7 players continue playing with the third substitute. Therefore, this results in $11 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 = 10 \\ 590$ possibilities.\n\n**Step 5: Sum the number of ways for each possible number of substitutions and find the remainder when divided by 1000.**\n\nNow we just add up the possibilities we found for each possible number of substitutions: \n$1 + 121 + 1 \\ 210 + 10 \\ 590 = 13 \\ 922.$\n\nWhen 13,922 is divided by 1000, we have a remainder of $\\boxed{922}.$ \n\nWe're asked for the answer in the format $\\boxed{answer}.$ Therefore, our final answer is:\n \n$\\boxed{922}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways the coach can make substitutions during the game.

  "solution": "There are $0-3$ substitutions. The number of ways to sub any number of times must be multiplied by the previous number. This is defined recursively. The case for $0$ subs is $1$, and the ways to reorganize after $n$ subs is the product of the number of new subs ($12-n$) and the players that can be ejected ($11$). The formula for $n$ subs is then $a_n=11(12-n)a_{n-1}$ with $a_0=1$.\nSumming from $0$ to $3$ gives $1+11^2+11^{3}\\cdot 10+11^{4}\\cdot 10\\cdot 9$. Notice that $10+9\\cdot11\\cdot10=10+990=1000$.
