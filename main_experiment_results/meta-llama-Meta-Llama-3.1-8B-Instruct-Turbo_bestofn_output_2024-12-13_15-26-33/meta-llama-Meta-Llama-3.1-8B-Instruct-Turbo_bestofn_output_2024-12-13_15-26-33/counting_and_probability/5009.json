  "problem": "Let $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ be the vertices of a regular tetrahedron each of whose edges measures 1 meter. A bug, starting from vertex $A$, observes the following rule: at each vertex it chooses one of the three edges meeting at that vertex, each edge being equally likely to be chosen, and crawls along that edge to the vertex at its opposite end. Let $p = \\frac n{729}$ be the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ when it has crawled exactly 7 meters. Find the value of $n$.\n",

    "To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to find the probability of the bug being at vertex $A$ after crawling certain distances.\n\nLet $P(n)$ be the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ after crawling $n$ meters. \n\nWe know that $P(0) = 1$ since the bug starts at vertex $A$.\n\nSince the bug can only be at vertex $A$ if it just left a vertex that is not $A$, the probability $P(n+1)$ can be calculated as $\\frac{1}{3} \\times (1-P(n))$, because the bug can only be at vertex $A$ if it just left a vertex that is not $A$, and since it chooses one of the three edges meeting at that vertex, each edge being equally likely to be chosen.\n\nSo,\n\n$P(1) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (1-P(0)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (1-1) = 0$,\n\n$P(2) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (1-P(1)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (1-0) = \\frac{1}{3}$,\n\n$P(3) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (1-P(2)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (1-\\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{2}{9}$,\n\n$P(4) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (1-P(3)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (1-\\frac{2}{9}) = \\frac{7}{27}$,\n\n$P(5) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (1-P(4)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (1-\\frac{7}{27}) = \\frac{20}{81}$,\n\n$P(6) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (1-P(5)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (1-\\frac{20}{81}) = \\frac{61}{243}$,\n\n$P(7) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (1-P(6)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (1-\\frac{61}{243}) = \\frac{182}{729}$\n\nTherefore, the value of $n$ is $\\boxed{182}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's denote the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ after crawling $n$ meters as $P_n$. \n\nSince the bug is equally likely to choose any of the three edges at each vertex, it will leave the current vertex with probability $\\frac13$.\n\nIf the bug is at vertex $A$ after crawling $n$ meters, then it must not have been at vertex $A$ after crawling $n-1$ meters. We can denote the probability that the bug is not at vertex $A$ after crawling $n-1$ meters as $Q_{n-1}$. \n\nSo, we have the relationship $P_n = \\frac13 Q_{n-1}$. \n\nWe know that $Q_n + P_n = 1$ because the bug must be at either vertex $A$ or not in vertex $A$ at the $n^{th}$ step.\n\nUsing the relationship $P_n = \\frac13 Q_{n-1}$, we can rewrite this as $P_n + Q_n = 1$ becomes $Q_n = 1-P_n$ and $P_n = \\frac13 Q_{n-1}$ becomes $Q_n = 3P_n$.\n\nNow, we can equate both expressions for $Q_n$ and obtain:\n\n$1-P_n = 3P_n$\n\n$1 = 4P_n$\n\n$P_n = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nTherefore, the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ after crawling $n$ meters is $P_n = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nWe are given that the bug crawls exactly 7 meters.

  "solution": "Let $P(n)$ denote the probability that the bug is at $A$ after it has crawled $n$ meters. Since the bug can only be at vertex $A$ if it just left a vertex which is not $A$, we have $P(n + 1) = \\frac13 (1 - P(n))$. We also know $P(0) = 1$, so we can quickly compute $P(1)=0$, $P(2) = \\frac 13$, $P(3) = \\frac29$, $P(4) = \\frac7{27}$, $P(5) = \\frac{20}{81}$, $P(6) = \\frac{61}{243}$ and $P(7) = \\frac{182}{729}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{182}$. One can solve this recursion fairly easily to determine a closed-form expression for $P(n)$.",
