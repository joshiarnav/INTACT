    "To solve this problem, we will first determine the range of students studying Spanish and French separately. Then, we'll use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle to find the range of students studying both languages.\n\n1. **Spanish Students:**\n   - The number of Spanish students is between $80\\%$ and $85\\%$ of the school population ($2001$ students).\n   - $80\\%$ of $2001$ is $\\left\\lfloor 0.8 \\times 2001 \\right\\rfloor = 1600$.\n   - $85\\%$ of $2001$ is $\\left\\lceil 0.85 \\times 2001 \\right\\rceil = 1701$.\n   So, the number of students studying Spanish is between $1600$ and $1701$, inclusive.\n\n2. **French Students:**\n   - The number of French students is between $30\\%$ and $40\\%$ of the school population ($2001$ students).\n   - $30\\%$ of $2001$ is $\\left\\lfloor 0.3 \\times 2001 \\right\\rfloor = 600$.\n   - $40\\%$ of $2001$ is $\\left\\lceil 0.4 \\times 2001 \\right\\rceil = 800$.\n   So, the number of students studying French is between $600$ and $800$, inclusive.\n\n3. **Both Languages:**\n   Apply the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle. Suppose $S$ is the set of students studying Spanish, $F$ is the set of students studying French, and $S\\cap F$ is the set of students studying both. Then the total number of students is $|S \\cup F| = |S| + |F| - |S\\cap F|$.\n   - Let $S = [1600, 1701]$, $F = [600, 800]$, and $S \\cap F = [m, M]$.\n   - For the smallest value, $m$, we minimize the expression $|S| + |F| - |S\\cap F|$ by making $S\\cap F$ as small as possible. So, $|S\\cap F| = 1600 + 600 - 2001$, which simplifies to $|S\\cap F| = 199$.\n   - For the largest value, $M$, we maximize the expression by making $S\\cap F$ as large as possible. So, $|S\\cap F| = 1701 + 800 - 2001 = 500$.\n   Therefore, the smallest and the largest possible values of students studying both languages are $m=199$ and $M=500$, respectively.\n   Finally, we have $M - m = 500 - 199 = \\boxed{301}$.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the largest and the smallest possible number of students who study both languages is $301$.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest and largest number of students who could study both languages.\n\nLet's assume that there are $S$ students who study Spanish, $F$ students who study French, and $S \\cap F$ students who study both.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that $80\\% \\leq \\frac{S}{2019} \\leq 85\\%$ and $30\\% \\leq \\frac{F}{2019} \\leq 40\\%$.\n\nWe can rewrite these inequalities as follows:\n\n$1617.6 \\leq S \\leq 1713.25$\n\n$605.7 \\leq F \\leq 805.5$\n\nSince $S$ and $F$ are integers, we can round up the lower bound of $S$ and the lower bound of $F$, and round down the upper bound of $S$ and the upper bound of $F$.\n\nSo we have:\n\n$1618 \\leq S \\leq 1713$\n\n$606 \\leq F \\leq 805$\n\nNow, let's consider the number of students who study both languages, $S \\cap F$. \n\nThe total number of students is the sum of students who study Spanish, students who study French, and students who study both languages minus the number of students who study both languages.\n\nSo we can write an inequality for the number of students who study both languages as follows:\n\n$1618 + 606 - 2019 + (S \\cap F) \\leq 2019$\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get:\n\n$305 + (S \\cap F) \\leq 2019$\n\n$(S \\cap F) \\leq 1714$\n\nTo find the smallest number of students who could study both languages, we need to find the smallest value of $S$ and the smallest value of $F$ that satisfies the inequality.\n\nThe smallest value of $S$ is 1618 and the smallest value of $F$ is 606.\n\nSubstituting these values into the inequality $(S \\cap F) \\leq 1714$, we get:\n\n$(1618 + 606 - 2019) + (S \\cap F) \\leq 1714$\n\nSimplifying the inequality, we get:\n\n$(S \\cap F) \\leq 1109$\n\nSo the smallest number of students who could study both languages is $1109$.\n\nNow, let's consider the largest number of students who study both languages, $M$.
