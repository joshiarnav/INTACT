    "To find the total number of sets of two non-empty disjoint subsets of $\\mathcal{S}$, let's consider the possibilities for choosing two subsets.\n\nFirst, we need to choose one subset $A$ from the set $\\mathcal{S}$. This can be done in $2^{10}$ ways, as each element in $\\mathcal{S}$ can be chosen or not chosen for $A$. However, we also include the empty set as a choice, so we will need to handle this separately later.\n\nNext, we need to choose another subset $B$ from $\\mathcal{S}$. This can also be done in $2^{10}$ ways. However, since we want the subsets $A$ and $B$ to be disjoint, we cannot simply choose any combination of subsets.\n\nThere are 4 possible disjoint scenarios: $A$ is a subset of $B$, $B$ is a subset of $A$, $A$ and $B$ are both subsets of a third set $C$ (the case where A or B is empty is handled separately), or neither $A$ nor $B$ is a subset of the other.\n\nHowever, the subsets A and B cannot both be a subset of the other set because in that case the subset they are both a subset of, would contain all elements in set A and set B, making the set with {A and B} as subset contain 10 elements which contain the set {1,2,3} as a subset as well. Therefore this is excluded from the possible disjoint subset combinations. \n\nHowever we cannot deal with it directly we are going to deal with it by first counting a couple of disjoint sets with one not being the empty set and then handling the opposite by subtracting the counts we get when both A and B are the empty set (orchestrating that our counts for this case with both A and B are empty are not double counted)\n\nTo calculate our answer let's take $S$ to be the set of subsets of $S$ including the empty set. The number of unordered pairs of disjoint subsets of $S$ can be written as the number of ordered pairs $(A,B)$ where $A$ and $B$ are disjoint subsets of $S$. Consider all of the elements $x\\in S$. If $x$ is in $A$, then $x$ cannot be in $B$, and therefore the pair $(A,B)$ can be described by a string $s=A\\cup B$ of length $10$. There are $11^{10}$ possible such strings, as $s$ can include the element $x$ from 0 to 1 times (not including the case with 0 times). That case is handled below.\n\nHowever, we also have to consider the case where $x$ is the empty string. This corresponds to the case where both $A$ and $B$ are the empty set. Since we're considering unordered pairs, we therefore have to divide by 2 to get the total number of unordered pairs $(A,B)$ of subsets of $S.$ Therefore, we have the expression:\n\n$$\\frac{11^{10}}{2}-1.$$\n\nPlugging this into a calculator and finding the remainder when this is divided by 1000 we get:\n\n$$  \\boxed{501}.$$",
    "To solve this problem, we will use a method of stars and bars, along with considering the different possible cases of subsets. We need to count the number of sets of two non-empty disjoint subsets of $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nLet $A$ and $B$ be two disjoint subsets of $\\mathcal{S}$. Let $A'$ be the set of elements that are in $A$ or $B$, and let $S'$ be the set of elements that are neither in $A$ nor $B$. We consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: Both $A$ and $B$ are nonempty and not equal to $S$.\n\nTo count the number of possibilities of this case, we need to consider the following:\n\n- We choose the elements that are in $A$, i.e., $|A|$.\n- We choose the elements that are in $B$, i.e., $|B|$.\n- The remaining elements are in $S'$.\n\nSince the elements in $A$ and $B$ are distinct, and we have $10$ elements in total, we have:\n\n$|A| + |B| \\leq 10$\n\nWe now use stars and bars method to count the number of possibilities.\n\nWe use ${10 - |A| \\choose |B|}$ to count the number of ways to choose the elements in $B$.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the different possible values of $|A|$, i.e., from $1$ to $9$.\n\nThus, the total number of possibilities for this case is:\n\n$\\sum_{i = 1}^{9} {10 - i \\choose i} = 333$\n\nCase 2: Exactly one of $A$ and $B$ is nonempty.\n\nIf $A$ is nonempty, we need to consider the following:\n\n- We choose the elements that are in $A$, i.e., $|A|$.\n- The remaining elements are in $S'$ (or $B$).\n\nSince $A$ is nonempty, we have:\n\n$|A| \\neq 0$\n\nWe use ${10 \\choose |A|}$ to count the number of ways to choose the elements in $A$.\n\nThus, the total number of possibilities for this case is:\n\n$\\sum_{i = 1}^{9} {10 \\choose i} = 1023$\n\nHowever, this count also includes cases where $A = S$, which means $A$ and $B$ are equal.\n\nTo account for this, we need to subtract the number of possibilities where $A = S$, i.e., $1$ possibility for each $|A|$ from $1$ to $10$, except for $|A| = 0$, which is not allowed.\n\nThus, the corrected count for this case is:\n\n$1023 - 10 = 1013$\n\nSince the case where $B$ is nonempty is symmetric to the case where $A$ is nonempty, we have the same count for this case.\n\nCase 3: Both $A$ and $B$ are empty.\n\nThere is only $1$ possibility for this case: $A = B = S' = \\emptyset$.\n\nHowever, this case is not allowed, since $A$ and $B$ are required to be nonempty.\n\nThus, the total number of possibilities for this case is $0$.\n\nWe now combine the counts from the different cases:\n\n$n = 333 + 1013 \\equiv 346 \\pmod{1000}$\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{346}$.",
    "To find the number of sets of two non-empty disjoint subsets of $\\mathcal{S}$, we can consider the different combinations of the sets.\n\nFor any set $A$ of 2 non-empty disjoint subsets $A_1, A_2$ where $A_1$ and $A_2$ are disjoint, there are 3 possible choices for the set $A$ to be in:\n\n1.
