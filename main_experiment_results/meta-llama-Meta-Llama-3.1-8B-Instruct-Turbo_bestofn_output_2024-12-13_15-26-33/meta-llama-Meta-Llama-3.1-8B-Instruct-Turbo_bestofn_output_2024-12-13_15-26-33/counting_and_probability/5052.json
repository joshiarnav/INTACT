    "To find the sum of the areas of all triangles whose vertices are also vertices of a $1$ by $1$ by $1$ cube, we need to consider the different types of triangles formed by these vertices.\n\n1.

    "To find the sum of the areas of all triangles whose vertices are also vertices of a $1$ by $1$ by $1$ cube, we can categorize the triangles based on their location in relation to the cube.\n\nThere are $8$ vertices of the cube.  This gives us the potential to make $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ unique triangles.\n\nWe can break down the categorization into three types:\n\n1. Triangles contained within a single face of the cube: Each face of the cube contains $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ triangles of this type.  Since there are $6$ faces, there are $6 \\cdot 4 = 24$ triangles of this type. The area of each of these triangles is $\\frac13$ (using a parallelogram to form the triangle's height or by otherwise reasoning). Therefore, the sum of areas of these triangles is $\\frac{24}{3} = 8$.\n\n2. Triangles lying in a plane perpendicular to one face of the cube: Each edge of the cube is a side of exactly $2$ of these triangles, and there are $12$ edges, giving $24$ triangles of this type.  Each of these triangles are right-angled with legs of length $1$ and $\\sqrt 2$. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the area of these triangles, or we can otherwise reason that the area is $\\frac{\\sqrt 2}{2}$.\nThe sum of the areas of these triangles is $24 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt 2}{2} = 12\\sqrt 2$.\n\n3. Triangles lying in a plane oblique to the edges of the cube: Each vertex of the cube is associated with $4$ triangles of this type.  Each triangle associated with a vertex is an equilateral triangle with side length $\\sqrt 2$ (its vertice's distance to its two opposites vertices), and we can calculate the area of each of the triangles in this type as $\\frac{\\sqrt 3}{4}\\cdot\\left(\\sqrt 2\\right)^2$ or by otherwise reasoning. The sum of areas of these triangles is $4 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt 3}{4} \\cdot 2 = 2 \\sqrt 3$.\nTherefore, the sum of the areas of all the triangles is $8 + 12\\sqrt 2 + 2\\sqrt3 = 8 + \\sqrt{288} + \\sqrt{84}$.  Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{8 + 288 + 84 = 380}$"
