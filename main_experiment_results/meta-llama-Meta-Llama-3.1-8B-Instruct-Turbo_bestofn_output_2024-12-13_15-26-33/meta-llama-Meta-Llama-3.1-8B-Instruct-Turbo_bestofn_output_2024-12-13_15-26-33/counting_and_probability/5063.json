  "problem": "The cards in a stack of $2n$ cards are numbered consecutively from 1 through $2n$ from top to bottom. The top $n$ cards are removed, kept in order, and form pile $A.$ The remaining cards form pile $B.$ The cards are then restacked by taking cards alternately from the tops of pile $B$ and $A,$ respectively. In this process, card number $(n+1)$ becomes the bottom card of the new stack, card number 1 is on top of this card, and so on, until piles $A$ and $B$ are exhausted. If, after the restacking process, at least one card from each pile occupies the same position that it occupied in the original stack, the stack is named magical. For example, eight cards form a magical stack because cards number 3 and number 6 retain their original positions. Find the number of cards in the magical stack in which card number 131 retains its original position.\n",

    "To find the total number of cards in the magical stack, we need to understand how the cards from the two piles are stacked and placed.\n\nWe are given that card number 1 is on top of card number (n+1), and they are stacked in this order. Then, cards number 2 and number (n+2) will be in this order, cards number 3 and number (n+3), and so on.\n\nAs we are given that the card with number 131, ends up in its original position, we must consider how many cards are placed in front of and after card number 131 in the new stack.\n\nSince card number 131 is at its original position, then it is actually in pile A. Cards in A occupy the positions: 1, 3, 5, ..., 2n-1 (as these are odd positions.)\n\nIn order to find the number of cards in the magical stack, we can figure out where card 131 is in pile A, which in turn tells us the number of cards in front of 131. Since card number 131 is in its original position, it is more sensible to understand that there are (131 - 1)/2 cards because cards in pile A are the odd numbers from 1 to 2n-1.\n\nTo find n, we need to figure out how many cards reside before 131 and then proceed from there to compute 2n.\n\nThere are ((131-1)/2) = (130/2) = 65 cards before 131 in pile A, because there are 65 odd numbers before number 131.\n\nThere is also one card which is card number 131 which we already took into account.\n\nSo, n = 65 + 131 + 1 = 197 numbers in pile A.\n\nBut, the original stack consists of 2n cards. Because card 131 is in its original spot in A, the number of cards in the stack is therefore: \n\n2n = 2 * 197 = 394\n\nTherefore, the number of cards in the stack that lets card 131 retain its original position is 394.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{394}$",
    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Understand the process of restacking the cards.\n\nWhen the cards are stack alternately from the tops of pile B and A, the cards from pile B will be in positions 1, 3, 5, ... (i.e., positions of odd numbers) and the cards from pile A will be in positions 2, 4, 6, ... (i.e., positions of even numbers) in the new stack.\n\nStep 2: Identify the condition for a card to retain its original position.\n\nFor a card to retain its original position, it must be placed back in an even position if it was originally in an even position, and it must be placed back in an odd position if it was originally in an odd position.\n\nStep 3: Determine the position of card 131.\n\nSince 131 is an odd number, to retain its original position, it must be placed back in an odd position in the new stack.\n\nStep 4: Determine the total number of cards in the magical stack.\n\nLet the total number of cards be 2n. Card 131 is in an odd position, so it was also in an odd position in the original stack. The distance of 131 from the top of the original stack is n = 131 - 1 = 130.\n\nStep 5: Find the value of n.\n\nSince the stacks of A and B are interwoven, for every odd card, there must be an even card. For a card in an odd position in the original stack, the preceding card is in an even position in the original stack. As such, there must be an odd number of even cards to the left of card 131 in the original stack. Similarly, the following card of 131 is also an even number. Thus, as such, there must be an odd number of even cards to the right of card 131 in the original stack. Combining these information with the card 131 itself being an odd number, card 131 was originally in an odd position. Since card 131 is an odd number, there must be n = 130 even cards to its left. Therefore, 2n - 1 = n + 130 (since the n cards to the left of card 131 and card 131 itself are in odd position in the interwoven stack), This can also be expressed as the equation (2n - 1) /2 is an integer since n is an even number.\n\nStep 6: Solve the equation to find n.\n\nSimplifying the above equation:\n2n - 1 = n + 130\n2n - n = 130 + 1\nn = 131.\nTherefore, 2n = 262.\n\nStep 7: The value of 2n is 262 for card 131 to retain its original position.\n\nStep 8: Assemble the answer.\n\nThe number of cards in the magical stack is 262.\n\nTherefore,\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{262}$"

  "solution": "Since a card from B is placed on the bottom of the new stack, notice that cards from pile B will be marked as an even number in the new pile, while cards from pile A will be marked as odd in the new pile. Since 131 is odd and retains its original position in the stack, it must be in pile A. Also to retain its original position, exactly $131 - 1 = 130$ numbers must be in front of it. There are $\\frac{130}{2} = 65$ cards from each of piles A, B in front of card 131. This suggests that $n = 131 + 65 = 196$; the total number of cards is $196 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{392}$.",
