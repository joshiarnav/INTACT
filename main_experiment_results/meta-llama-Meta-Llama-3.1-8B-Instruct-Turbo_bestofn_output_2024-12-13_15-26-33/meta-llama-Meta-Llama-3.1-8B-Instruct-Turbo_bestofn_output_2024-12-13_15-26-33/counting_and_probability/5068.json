  "problem": "Seven teams play a soccer tournament in which each team plays every other team exactly once. No ties occur, each team has a $50\\%$ chance of winning each game it plays, and the outcomes of the games are independent. In each game, the winner is awarded a point and the loser gets 0 points. The total points are accumilated to decide the ranks of the teams. In the first game of the tournament, team $A$ beats team $B.$ The probability that team $A$ finishes with more points than team $B$ is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$\n",

    "To calculate the probability that team $A$ finishes with more points than team $B$, we need to consider the possible outcomes in the games between teams $A$ and $B$ and other teams.\n\nInitially, we know that $A$ beats $B$ in the first game. This gives $A$ a point advantage over $B$. The main thing we want to consider now is the number of games $B$ wins.\n\nCase 1: If $B$ wins $0$ games, then $A$ will have a higher score than $B$ for sure because of the initial win over $B$. For this case, $B$ must lose to all the other teams, so the probability is $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{32}$.\n\nCase 2: If $B$ wins $1$ game, then for $A$ to have a higher score, $A$'s wins must be more than $B$'s wins. This can be considered as a Bernoulli trial. The probability of $A$ winning $x$ games out of the $4$ remaining ones (excluding the game against $B$) is the binomial coefficient times the probability of $x$ wins, and the rest being losses: $$4 \\choose 3 {1 \\choose 1} = 0.\\overline{4}  $$\n\nCase 3: If $B$ wins $2$ games, again we have a similar Bernoulli trial where the probability will be\n${4 \\choose 2}{1 \\choose 1} = \\frac{6}{16}$\n\nCase 4: If $B$ wins $3$ games, the probability is\n${4 \\choose 1}{1 \\choose 1} = \\frac{4}{16}$\n\nCase 5: If $B$ wins $4$ games, then $A$ definitely won't have a higher score than $B$. So no need to consider that case.\n\nThe overall probability that $A$ finishes with more points than $B$ is\n\\[\\frac{1}{32}+\\left(4 \\choose 3\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5+\\left({4 \\choose 2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5+\\left({4 \\choose 1}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5=\\frac{319}{512}\\]\n\nThen, we need to find the smallest that $m+n$ can be, since $\\frac{319}{512}$ is already in simplest form and there are no other possibilities, $m+n=\\boxed{831}$.",
    "To determine the probability that team $A$ finishes with more points than team $B$, we must consider the number of games won by each team, excluding the game in which team $A$ initially beats team $B$.\n\nInitially, team $A$ has one game, and team $B$ has zero games. To have a higher total point count than team $B$, team $A$ must win at least as many games as team $B$. However, since team $A$ has already won one game, team $B$ must have at most as many wins as team $A$.\n\nWe will use casework to analyze the possible scenarios in which the points of team $A$ exceed those of team $B$. There are four possible cases:\n\nCase 1: Team $B$ wins $n$ games out of the remaining five games: The total number of ways this can happen is ${5\\choose n}\\cdot 2^{5-n}$. \n\nCase 2: Team $B$ wins $n$ games and team $A$ wins $n$ games: Since team $A$ has already won one game, it must win at least one more game than team $B$.

The total number of outcomes is $2^{10}$.\n\nWe can then calculate the probability that team $A$ finishes with more points than team $B$, and then find the sum of the numerator and denominator, resulting in our final answer.\n\nNow let's consider each case in more detail and calculate the total number of ways for each scenario:\n\nCase 1 and Case 2 don't count towards our favor, so let's begin with Case 3: \n\nWhen Team $B$ wins $n$ games and team $A$ wins $n+1$ games, team $B$ must have the same number of losses as team $A$ has wins $+1$.

The number of ways for $A$ to win exactly three games out of the $5$ the teams play is ${5\\choose 3}\\cdot 2^{5-3}=40$.  \n   Similarly, the number of ways for $A$ to win three games and $B$ to win one game is ${5\\choose 1}\\cdot 2^{5-1}= 80$. The number of ways for $A$ to win four games and $B$ to win zero game is ${5\\choose 0} \\cdot 2^{5-0} = 32$.
