    "To solve this, we'll break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Total number of arrangements without restrictions**: \n   - Since the plates are arranged around a circular table, we calculate the total number of arrangements using the formula for circular permutations, which is $\\frac{n!}{n}$. But in this case, since we have repeating plates, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n       \\text{Total Arrangements} = \\frac{n!}{n_1! \\times n_2! \\times n_3! \\times n_4!}\n   \\]\n   - Here, $n$ is the total number of plates ($5+2+2+1 = 10$), $n_1$ is the number of blue plates, $n_2$ is the number of red plates, $n_3$ is the number of green plates, and $n_4$ is the number of orange plates.\n   - Therefore, \n   \\[\n       \\frac{10!}{5! \\times 2! \\times 2! \\times 1!} = \\frac{3628800}{(120) \\times (2) \\times (2) \\times (1)} = \\frac{3628800}{480} = 7560\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of ways the green plates can be adjacent**: \n   - Now, let's calculate the number of ways the green plates can be adjacent.\n   - We consider the two green plates as one unit, so now we have $9$ units.\n   - Using the formula for circular permutations with repeating elements, we get:\n   \\[\n       \\text{Ways for green plates adjacent} = \\frac{9!}{5! \\times 2! \\times 1! \\times 1!} = \\frac{362880}{(120) \\times (2) \\times (1) \\times (1)} = \\frac{362880}{240} = 1512\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of ways green plates are not adjacent**:\n   - To find the number of arrangements where the green plates are not adjacent, we subtract the number of ways they can be adjacent from the total number of arrangements.\n   - Therefore, \n   \\[\n       \\text{Total Ways - Ways for green plates adjacent} = 7560 - 1512 = 6048\n   \\]\n   - So, there are $\\boxed{6048}$ ways to arrange the plates for dinner around her circular table if she doesn't want the 2 green plates to be adjacent.",
    "To find the total number of ways to arrange the plates, we will first consider the total number of arrangements without restrictions. \n\nSince the plates are placed in a circular arrangement, we will fix one plate (let's say the orange plate) as a reference point to avoid rotational symmetry. The number of ways to arrange the remaining plates in a line is the total number of permutations. There are (5+2+2+1-1) = 9 plates in total. \n\nThe total number of linear permutations is:\n9! / (5! * 2! * 2! * 1!) \nSince factorials are easy to calculate, let's simplify:\n= 9! / (120 * 2 * 2)\n= 9! / (480)\n= (9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / 480\n= (362880) / 480\n= 756\n\nHowever, in a circular arrangement, we need to divide this by the total number of rotations, which is 9. Thus the total number of circular permutations is:\n756 / 9 = 84\n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where the two green plates are adjacent. \n\nTo do this, we treat the two green plates as one single unit. The total number of items becomes 8 (5 blue plates, 2 red plates, 1 orange plate, and 1 \"2 green plates\" unit). \n\nThe number of linear permutations is:\n8! / (5! * 2! * 1! * 1!)\n= 8! / (120 * 2)\n= (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (240)\n= (40320) / (240)\n= 168\n\nBut in a circular arrangement, we need to divide this by the total number of rotations, which is 8. Thus the total number of circular permutations where the 2 green plates are adjacent is:\n168 / 8 = 21\n\nTherefore, the number of ways for the mother to arrange the plates around her circular table without having the two green plates adjacent is:\n= Total circular permutations - Circular permutations where the 2 green plates are adjacent\n= 84 - 21\n= 63\n\nSo, the answer is: $\\boxed{63}$"

  "solution": "We apply the complement principle: we find the total number of cases in which the 2 green places are adjacent, and subtract from the total number of cases.\nThere are $\\frac{10!}{5!2!2!1!} = 7560$ ways to arrange the plates in a linear fashion. However, since the plates are arranged in a circle, there are $10$ ways to rotate the plates, and so there are $7560/10 = 756$ ways to arrange the plates in a circular fashion (consider, for example, fixing the orange plate at the top of the table).\nIf the two green plates are adjacent, we may think of them as a single entity, so that there are now $9$ objects to be placed around the table in a circular fashion. Using the same argument, there are $\\frac{9!}{5!2!1!1!} = 1512$ ways to arrange the objects in a linear fashion, and $1512/9 = 168$ ways in a circular fashion.\nThus, the answer is $756 - 168 = \\boxed{588}$.",
