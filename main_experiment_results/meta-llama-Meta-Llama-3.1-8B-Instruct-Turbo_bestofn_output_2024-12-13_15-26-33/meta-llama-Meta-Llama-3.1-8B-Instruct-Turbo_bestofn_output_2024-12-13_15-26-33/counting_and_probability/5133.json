    "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of complementary counting. This means we'll count the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2, and no two consecutive 1's, and then subtract this from the total number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2.\n\nFirst, let's count the total number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2. Since each digit can be one of two numbers (1 or 2), and there are 10 digits in total, the total number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2 is $2^{10}$.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2, and no two consecutive 1's. Let $a_n$ be the number of $n$-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2, and no two consecutive 1's.\n\nFor $n = 1$, we have two possibilities: 1 and 2. So $a_1 = 2$.\n\nFor $n = 2$, we have three possibilities: 11 is not allowed, so we have 11, 12, and 21, for a total of three possibilities. So $a_2 = 3$.\n\nFor $n \\geq 3$, we can consider the last digit. If the last digit is 2, we can add 2 to $a_{n-1}$ to get $a_n$. If the last digit is 1, the second-to-last digit must be 2, so we can add $a_{n-2}$ to $a_{n-1}$ to get $a_n$. Therefore, we have a recurrence relation:\n\n$a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}.$\n\nUsing this recurrence relation, we can find $a_{10}$, which is the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2, and no two consecutive 1's.\n\nUsing the recurrence relation, we can calculate $a_n$ for larger values of $n$:\n\n$a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 3 + 2 = 5$\n$a_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 5 + 3 = 8$\n$a_5 = a_4 + a_3 = 8 + 5 = 13$\n$a_6 = a_5 + a_4 = 13 + 8 = 21$\n$a_7 = a_6 + a_5 = 21 + 13 = 34$\n$a_8 = a_7 + a_6 = 34 + 21 = 55$\n$a_9 = a_8 + a_7 = 55 + 34 = 89$\n$a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 = 89 + 55 = 144$\n\nTherefore, the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2, and no two consecutive 1's is 144.\n\nNow, we can find the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2, and at least two consecutive 1's, by subtracting the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2, and no two consecutive 1's from the total number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2.\n\nThe number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits 1 or 2, and at least two consecutive 1's is $2^{10} - 144 = \\boxed{59024}$.",
    "To find the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2 and have two consecutive 1's, we'll consider counting by complementation. \n\nStep 1: First, calculate the total number of possible 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2. This is a simple binary counting problem, where each digit can have 2 possible values. So, the total number of 10-digit integers is $2^{10}$.\n\nStep 2: Next, we will calculate the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2 but without two consecutive 1's. Let $a_n$ be the number of $n$-digit positive integers without two consecutive 1's. We will use recursion.\n\nStep 3: An $n$-digit integer can either end with 1 or 2.\n\n- If it ends with 2, it can be formed from an $(n-1)$-digit integer, for which there are $a_{n - 1}$ possibilities.\n- If it ends with 1, it can be formed from an $(n - 1)$-digit integer that ends with 1 and the $(n - 2)$-digit integer that ends with 2. There are $a_{n - 2}$ possibilities for the latter, which does not start with 2 and thus represents valid counting options for these possibilities but also with all other cases except those that do start with 2, with the exception of the (n - 2) digit integer cases in which the digit 1 is not present. Since all digit 2 cases would not allow the presence of two consecutive 1's we then need to subtract the options of all n - 2 digit integers that have 2 as the first digit. This description must be corrected, because they are actually the ones without 2 in the second digit. We have $a_{n-2} - a_{n-3} $ cases (because there are $a_{n-3} $ with two consecutive 1's)\n\nThus the recursion $a_n = a_{n - 1} + a_{n - 2} - a_{n - 3} $ should be used. Since we know $a_1 = 2, a_2 = 3,$ and $a_3 = 5,$ this gives us the starting point.\n\nStep 4: We now calculate $a_{10}$ by the recursion $a_{n} = a_{n - 1} + a_{n - 2} - a_{n - 3}$. We get $a_4 = 8, a_5 = 13,$ and, going from $a_n = a_{n - 1} + a_{n - 2} - a_{n - 3}$, we calculate each term up to $a_{10}$ as illustrated below: \n\n$a_6 = a_{5} + a_{4} - a_{3} = 13 + 8 - 5 = 16, \\\\\na_7 = a_{6} + a_{5} - a_{4} = 16 + 13 - 8 = 21, \\\\\na_8 = a_{7} + a_{6} - a_{5} = 21 + 16 - 13 = 24, \\\\\na_9 = a_{8} + a_{7} - a_{6} = 24 + 21 - 16 = 29. \\\\\na_{10} = a_{9} + a_{8} - a_7 = 29 + 24 - 21 = 32.$\n\nStep 5: Now, the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2 but without two consecutive 1's is the calculated value of $a_{10}$. \n\nSo, we can find the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2 and have two consecutive 1's by subtracting the value of $a_{10}$ from the total number of possible 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2 and have two consecutive 1's is $2^{10} - a_{10}$.\n\n$2^{10} - a_{10} = 1024 - 32 = 992$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{992}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's first find the total number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits as 1 or 2. \n\nEach digit can have two options, so for 10 digits, there would be:\n- 2 options for the first digit\n- 2 options for the second digit, and so on until the tenth digit\nThe total number of 10-digit positive integers would be:\n2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 \n= 2^10\n= 1024\n\nNow let's find the number of 10-digit positive integers without any consecutive 1's.\n\nLet $a_n$ be the number of n-digit positive integers without consecutive 1's. We can solve this problem recursively:\n\n1. If an n-digit number ends with a 1, then it must start with a 2 (or end with a 2 followed by a string of ones). This string can be of length $n-1$, and so there are $a_{n-1}$ such n-digit numbers.\n2. If an n-digit number ends with a 2, then the string of 1's and 2's it contains must be of the form 1...21, or 1...22, or 21...2, or 22...2. If the string is of the form 21...2, or 22...2, then it must be of a length of $n-2$. If the string is 1...21 or 1...22 then it is of length $n-1$ because the number can only start with 2. This gives $a_{n-1}$ possibilities of the first case, and $a_{n-2}$ possibilities of the second case.\n3. Therefore, there are $a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$  of the second case, such that an $n$-digit number ends in a 2.\n\nLet $b_n=a_n/a_{n-1}$ and assuming $b_{n-2},b_{n-1}$ have converged to $r$. Then\n\n$$b_{n-1}=\\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_{n-2}},$$\n$$b_{n}=\\frac{a_{n}}{a_{n-1}}.$$\nThen we have,\n$$b_{n}=\\frac{a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}}{a_{n-1}}$$\n$$r=\\frac{r+1}{r}$$\nCross multiplying we get\n$$r^{2}-r-1=0$$\nthis solves to\n$$r=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}=\\phi$$\nSince we need the number of $n$-digit numbers that DO contain 2 consecutive 1's, we can find this using the total number of $n$-digit positive integers minus the number of $n$-digit positive integers that DO NOT contain 2 consecutive 1's.\n\nTherefore the value would be $\\boxed{1024-\\phi^{9}}$"

  "solution": "We take as our universe the set of 10-digit integers whose digits are all either 1 or 2, of which there are $2^{10}$, and we count the complement. The complement is the set of 10-digit positive integers composed of the digits 1 and 2 with no two consecutive 1s. Counting such numbers is a popular combinatorial problem: we approach it via a recursion.\nThere are two \"good\" one-digit numbers (1 and 2) and three good two-digit numbers (12, 21 and 22). Each such $n$-digit number is formed either by gluing \"2\" on to the end of a good $(n - 1)$-digit number or by gluing \"21\" onto the end of a good $(n - 2)$-digit number. This is a bijection between the good $n$-digit numbers and the union of the good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. Thus, the number of good $n$-digit numbers is the sum of the number of good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. The resulting recursion is exactly that of the Fibonacci numbers with initial values $F_1 = 2$ and $F_2 = 3$.\nThus, our final answer is $2^{10} - F_{10} = 1024 - 144 = \\boxed{880}$.",
