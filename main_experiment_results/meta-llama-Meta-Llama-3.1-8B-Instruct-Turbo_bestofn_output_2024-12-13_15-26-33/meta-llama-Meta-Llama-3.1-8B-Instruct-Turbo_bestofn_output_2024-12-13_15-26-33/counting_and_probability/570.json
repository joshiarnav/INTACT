    "To find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's, we can consider the complementary probability, i.e., the probability that Greg rolls either the same number of 1's and 6's or more 6's than 1's. This will make it easier to calculate and then find the answer by subtracting this probability from 1.\n\nThe complementary events are (i) Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's, and (ii) Greg rolls more 6's than 1's.\n\nFirst, let's consider case (i): The number of ways to roll the same number of 1's and 6's is as follows:\n- Two 1's and two 6's can be rolled in $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.\n- One 1 and one 6 can be rolled in $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1} = 12$ ways. However, this can be rolled in two different ways (1, 1, x, 6 or 1, x, 1, 6), so we have $12 \\cdot 2 = 24$ ways to roll this combination.\nTherefore, in total, we have $6 + 24 = 30$ ways to roll the same number of 1's and 6's.\n\nNow, consider case (ii): The number of ways to roll more 6's than 1's is as follows:\n- Three 6's and one 1 can be rolled in $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$ ways.\n- Four 6's can be rolled in $\\binom{4}{4} = 1$ way.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to roll more 6's than 1's is $4 + 1 = 5$.\n\nNow, the complementary probability is the total number of ways to roll the same number of 1's and 6's or more 6's than 1's divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is $6^4$.\nSo the complementary probability is $\\frac{30 + 5}{6^4} = \\frac{35}{1296}$.\n\nFinally, the desired probability is $1$ minus the complementary probability:\n$1 - \\frac{35}{1296} = \\frac{1261}{1296} = \\boxed{\\frac{1261}{1296}}$",
    "To calculate the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's, we can first analyze the problem from a complementary perspective. \n\nWe can calculate the probability that Greg rolls more 6's than 1's and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability of more 1's than 6's.\n\n1. **Step 1: Counting the ways to have more 6's than 1's**\n\nWe first need to identify the cases in which Greg rolls more 6's than 1's. There are a few cases to consider:\n\n- Greg rolls no 1's and at least one 6. (In this case, it's guaranteed he has more 6's than 1's.)\n- Greg rolls two 1's and at least one 6.\n- Greg rolls three 1's and no 6's is impossible in this scenario, so there are no 6's.\n\n2. **Step 2: Calculating the ways to have no 1's and at least one 6**\n\nTo calculate the ways in this case, we can use combinations (for the number of 6's rolled) and the product rule.\n\nThe total number of outcomes for four six-sided dice is $6^4 = 1296.$\n\nTo have no 1's, we have 5 options for each of the 4 dice (2,3,4,5,6), resulting in $5^4 = 625$ configurations. Of these configurations, there are $5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 120$ configurations with at least one 6. So, the probability of having no 1's and at least one 6 is $\\frac{120}{625}.$\n\n3. **Step 3: Calculating the ways to have two 1's and at least one 6**\n\nWe can use combinations to calculate the ways in this case. There are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to have two 1's (with one 1 appearing first, we calculate the combinations in order). For each of these ways, there are $\\binom{2}{1} = 2$ ways to choose which of the other 2 dice show a 6 and for each of these ways of choosing which dice to be 6, there are $5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 = 125$ possible configurations for the remaining two dice. Therefore, the number of ways for this case is $\\binom{4}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 125 = 6 \\cdot 250 = 1500.$\n\nHowever, we must then apply the product rule to these dice because these dice can be ordered (i.e., as $1,1,6,6$, or $1,6,1,6, etc.) and apply the multiplication principle. The ways Greg rolls the dice where two 1's appear and there is at least one six is actually $\\binom{4}{2}\\cdot \\binom{2}{1} \\cdot 5^2$ (because there is only one remaining choice of 6 out of 2 dice possible after seeing the two 1's). So $6 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 25$ is the number of ways, $\\frac{6 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 25}{6^4} = \\frac{150}{1296}. $\n\n4. **Step 4: Calculating the ways to have three 1's and no 6's**\n\nSince we already know how many ways we can roll with no 1's or two 1's, we must now determine the ways we can roll with three 1's and no sixes. We have 5 possible values for the remaining die, which can appear in any of the four dice for three 1's. So, $\\binom{4}{3} \\cdot 5$. This gives us $\\frac{\\binom{4}{3} \\cdot 5}{6^4} = \\frac{20}{1296}.$\n\n5. **Step 5: Finding the total probability for more 6's than 1's**\n\nThe total number of ways Greg can roll more 6's than 1's is $\\frac{120}{625} + \\frac{150}{1296} + \\frac{20}{1296} = \\frac{180+50+10}{1296} = \\frac{240}{1296}.$\n\n6. **Step 6: Finding the probability for more 1's than 6's**\n\nUsing complementary counting, we know that $1 - \\frac{240}{1296} = \\frac{1056}{1296} = \\boxed{\\frac{22}{27}}$ is our answer."

  "solution": "We notice that the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's must equal the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's. So, we can find the probability that Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's, subtract it from 1, and divide by 2 to find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's. There are three ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's: he can roll two of each, one of each, or none of each. If he rolls two of each, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which two dice roll the 1's. If he rolls one of each, there are $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1}=12$ ways to choose which dice are the 6 and the 1, and for each of those ways there are $4\\cdot4=16$ ways to choose the values of the other dice. If Greg rolls no 1's or 6's, there are $4^4=256$ possible values for the dice. In total, there are $6+12\\cdot16+256=454$ ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's. There are $6^4=1296$ total ways the four dice can roll, so the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\left(1-\\dfrac{454}{1296}\\right)=\\boxed{\\dfrac{421}{1296}}$.",
