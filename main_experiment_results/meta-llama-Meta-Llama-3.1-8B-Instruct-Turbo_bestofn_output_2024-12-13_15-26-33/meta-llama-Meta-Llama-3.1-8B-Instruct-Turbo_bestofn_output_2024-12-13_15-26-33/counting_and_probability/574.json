    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\n1. Total number of integers: We are given that the integer is between 9 and 100, so it ranges from 10 to 99. To find the total number of integers, subtract the lower limit from the upper limit and add 1.\n\n   Total numbers = 99 - 10 + 1 = 90\n\n2. Integers with the same digits: For the single-digit integers (11, 22, ..., 99), we can see there are 9 such integers (11, 22, 33, ..., 99). So, the number of integers with the same digits is 9.\n\n3. Integers with different digits: To find the number of integers with different digits, subtract the number of integers with the same digits from the total number of integers.\n\n   Integers with different digits = Total numbers - Integers with the same digits\n   = 90 - 9\n   = 81\n\n4. Probability: The probability of choosing an integer with different digits is the number of integers with different digits divided by the total number of integers.\n\n   Probability = Integers with different digits / Total numbers\n   = 81 / 90\n   = 9 / 10\n\nTherefore, the probability that the integer's digits are different is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",
    "To find the probability that the digits of the chosen integer are different, we need to consider the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes.\n\n1. Total number of possible outcomes:\n   Since the integer is greater than 9 and less than 100, it can range from 10 to 99. \n   The number of possible outcomes is the total count of numbers in this range. \n   To find it, we subtract the lower limit from the upper limit and add 1: \n   99 - 10 + 1 = 90.\n\n2. Number of favorable outcomes:\n   We will count the numbers where the digits are not different. \n   There are 10 numbers where the digits are the same: \n   11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99. \n   The number of favorable outcomes is the total count of numbers minus these instances:\n   90 - 9 = 81 favorable outcomes, but that doesn't include having a first digit that is 0. There are more than 81. So one must find the 9 numbers from 10 to 98 that start with 0. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90.\n\n   For 10 through to 98, (98 - 10)/10 = 9 to cover them all from 10 to 90. We know the amount from 91-99 (9 including 99) from (99 - 91)/9 + 1 = 11. That means of the 81 that wasn't subtracting the non-zero leading numbers there were more to be subtracted. You had to calculate 9 (leading 0) + nine (two digit, second digit matching first digit). It equals to 18 outcomes to subtract from the 90 total. Then solving 90 - 18 - 9 (non-zero leading 9 non leading to have one number that is double) because, 10 that makes the total (0 leading that it was double as one of the digits = one subtraction, (9 leading when doubling the non leading zero because the other one would be double to that number with its one non-zero leading number already excluded from total to be counted, when the total was counted) = 18 total that it was one of the digits = one subtraction, (9 leading (the total (non-zero leading non leading matching)) and  that it was one of the digits = one subtraction, total that leading 9 when doubling non.\"matching non leading 9 = one countable as it becomes double one subtraction). The total to count and subtract from this total after counting it is, 90 - 27 = 63.\n\nThe probability that the digits of the chosen integer are different is: \n63 / 90 = 7 / 10\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{10}}$."
