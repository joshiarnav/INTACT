    "To find the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen, we'll break it down into two separate steps.\n\nStep 1: The probability of the first card being a 6.\n\n- There are 52 cards in a standard deck, of which 4 are 6s (one from each suit).\n- Therefore, the probability of drawing a 6 as the first card is $\\frac{4}{52}$. \n\nStep 2: The probability of the second card being a Queen, given that the first card was a 6.\n\n- After drawing the first card, there are 51 cards left in the deck.\n- Of these, there are 4 Queens.\n- Therefore, the probability of drawing a Queen as the second card is $\\frac{4}{51}$.\n\nTo find the probability that both of these events occur, we multiply them together.\n\n$\\frac{4}{52} \\times \\frac{4}{51} = \\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{4}{51} = \\frac{4}{2652} = \\frac{1}{663}$\n\nThe probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{663}}$.",
    "To find the probability, let's break it down into steps.\n\n**Step 1:** The probability of the first card being a 6.\n\nThere are 4 sixes in a standard deck of 52 cards (one in each suit: hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds). \n\nThe probability of the first card being a 6 is: \nNumber of favorable outcomes (sixes) / Total number of outcomes \n= 4/52 \n= 1/13 \n\n**Step 2:** The probability of the second card being a Queen, given that the first card is a 6.\n\nSince a standard deck has 4 Queens and we've already drawn one card (a 6), there are now 51 cards remaining in the deck.
