  "problem": "A Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans. Assuming all politicians are distinguishable, in how many ways can they sit around a circular table without restrictions?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to consider that the table is circular, which means the seating arrangements are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other. This adjusts our approach from linear arrangements to circular arrangements.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of ways to arrange 10 people in a linear fashion. Since the order matters, we use permutations:\n\n10 P 10 = 10! = 3,628,800\n\nHowever, since the table is circular, we need to account for the fact that rotating the seating doesn't change the arrangement. To do this, we divide by the number of possible rotations, which corresponds to the number of ways to choose a fixed position in the linear arrangement. \n\nFor a circular table with 10 people, we have 10 possible rotations (starting from person 1, person 2, ..., person 10). Therefore, we divide the total number of linear arrangements by 10:\n\n3,628,800 / 10 = 362,880\n\nSo, there are 362,880 ways for the Senate committee members to sit around a circular table without restrictions.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{362,880}$",
    "To solve this problem, we will follow the steps to calculate the number of circular permutations.\n\n1. First, if we have 'n' distinguishable objects to arrange in a line, the number of linear permutations is given by n!. \n\n2. However, when arranging objects in a circle, we consider rotations of the same seating as identical. This means that for every arrangement, there are (n-1) rotations of the same arrangement.\n\n3. To counter this, we divide the total number of linear permutations by (n-1) to get the total number of distinct circular permutations.\n\nGiven that there are 10 distinct politicians (5 Democrats and 5 Republicans), we can proceed as follows:\n\n- The total number of linear permutations is 10! (10 factorial) since there are 10 distinguishable politicians.\n- Now, we divide the total number of linear permutations by (10-1) to account for rotations.\n- So, the total number of distinct circular permutations is 10!/9.\n\nCalculating this:\n\n10!/9 = (10 x 9!)/9\n   = (10 x 9!)/9\n   = 10 x 8! \n    = 10 x (8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) \n    = 10 x 40320\n    = 403200\n\nTherefore, the number of ways the politicians can sit around a circular table is:\n\n$\\boxed{403200}$"

  "solution": "There are 10 people to place, so we can place them in $10!$ ways, but this counts each valid arrangement 10 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement).  So the number of ways to seat them is $\\dfrac{10!}{10} = 9! = \\boxed{362,\\!880}$.",
