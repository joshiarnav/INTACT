    "There are three horizontal stripes and two colors. Each stripe can be either of the two colors (purple and gold), so for each stripe, there are 2 possible colors.\n\nWe have a total of 3 stripes. If we multiply the number of possible colors for each stripe (2, 2, and 2), we would multiply 2 by itself 3 times to find the total number of different flags possible.\n\n$2\\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$\n\nTherefore, the total number of different flags possible is 8.\n\nSo the answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
    "There are three stripes, and we can choose any color for each stripe. \n\n1. The top stripe can be either purple or gold. This gives us 2 possibilities for the top stripe.\n\n2. The middle stripe can also be purple or gold. Since the middle stripe can be the same color as the top stripe, we have 2 possibilities for the middle stripe.\n\n3. Similarly, the bottom stripe can be purple or gold. Again, since the bottom stripe can be the same color as the top stripe and the middle stripe, we have 2 possibilities for the bottom stripe.\n\nTo find the total number of possible flags, we multiply the number of possibilities for each stripe together:\n\n2 (top) \u00d7 2 (middle) \u00d7 2 (bottom) = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 8\n\nSo, the total number of different flags possible is 8.\n\n$\\boxed{8}$",
    "To design the flag, we need to choose the colors for three horizontal stripes. Since each stripe can be either purple or gold, there are 2 options for each stripe. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The top stripe can be either purple or gold. Since there are 2 options, this gives us 2 possibilities.\n\n2. The middle stripe can also be either purple or gold, regardless of the color of the top stripe. This gives us another 2 possibilities. Since this choice is independent of the top stripe, we multiply the number of possibilities for the top stripe (2) by the number of possibilities for the middle stripe (2), resulting in a total of $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ possibilities.\n\n3. The bottom stripe also has 2 options, regardless of the colors of the top and middle stripes. This gives us another 2 possibilities. Since each choice is independent of the others, we multiply the number of possibilities for the top and middle stripes ($2 \\cdot 2 = 4$) by the number of possibilities for the bottom stripe (2), resulting in a total of $4 \\cdot 2 = 8$ possibilities.\n\nSo, there are $\\boxed{8}$ different possible flags."
