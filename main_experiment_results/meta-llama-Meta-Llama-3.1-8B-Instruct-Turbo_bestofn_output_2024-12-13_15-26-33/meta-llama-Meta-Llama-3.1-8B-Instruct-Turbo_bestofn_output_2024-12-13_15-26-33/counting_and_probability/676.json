  "problem": "I have 10 distinguishable socks in my drawer: 4 white, 4 brown, and 2 blue.  In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of the same color?",
  "all_solutions": [
    "To find the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color, we can consider each color separately and then add them up. \n\nFor white socks, we have 4 choices for the first sock and 3 remaining choices for the second sock (since we want a pair of the same color). Therefore, the number of ways to choose a pair of white socks is:\n\n4 (choices for the first sock) * 3 (choices for the second sock) = 12\n\nFor brown socks, we also have 4 choices for the first sock and 3 remaining choices for the second sock. Therefore, the number of ways to choose a pair of brown socks is also:\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nFor blue socks, we have 2 choices for the first sock and 1 remaining choice for the second sock. Therefore, the number of ways to choose a pair of blue socks is:\n\n2 * 1 = 2\n\nNow, we add up the number of ways to choose a pair of socks of each color to get the total:\n\n12 (white) + 12 (brown) + 2 (blue) = 26\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks, provided that we get two socks of the same color, is 26.\n\n$\\boxed{26}$",
    "To find the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks with the same color, we need to consider each color separately and then sum up the results.\n\n1. White socks: We have 4 white socks and want to choose 2 of them. This is a combination problem, and we can calculate it as follows:\n\n   C(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!)\n          = 4! / (2! * 2!)\n          = (4*3*2*1) / ((2*1) * (2*1))\n          = 24 / (2 * 2)\n          = 24 / 4\n          = 6\n\n   So, there are 6 ways to choose a pair of white socks.\n\n2. Brown socks: Similarly, we have 4 brown socks and want to choose 2 of them. This can be calculated as:\n\n   C(4,2) = 6\n\n   Since the calculation is the same as for the white socks, there are also 6 ways to choose a pair of brown socks.\n\n3. Blue socks: We have 2 blue socks and want to choose 2 of them. This can be calculated as:\n\n   C(2,2) = 2! / (2! * (2-2)!)\n           = 2! / (2! * 0!)\n           = (2*1) / ((2*1) * 1)\n           = 2 / (2 * 1)\n           = 2 / 2\n           = 1\n\n   So, there is only 1 way to choose a pair of blue socks.\n\nNow, let's sum up the results for each color:\n\n6 (white) + 6 (brown) + 1 (blue) = 13\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks with the same color is 13.\n\n$\\boxed{13}$",
    "To solve this problem, let's consider the different cases for the color of the socks. \n\nCase 1: White socks. Since we need to choose a pair of white socks, we have 4 choices for the first sock and 3 choices for the second sock (as we can't choose the same sock twice). However, we also have to account for the fact that the order of choosing the socks doesn't matter. Therefore, we need to divide by 2 to avoid counting each combination twice.\n\nNumber of ways to choose two white socks = (4 x 3) / 2 = 6\n\nCase 2: Brown socks. The same logic as in case 1 applies.\n\nNumber of ways to choose two brown socks = (4 x 3) / 2 = 6\n\nCase 3: Blue socks. Since we only have 2 blue socks, there is only 1 way to choose both blue socks (as there is only 1 other sock to choose after the first one).\n\nNumber of ways to choose two blue socks = 1\n\nNow, let's add up the number of ways from each case to get the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color.\n\nTotal number of ways = 6 + 6 + 1 = 13\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{13}$."

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, we need to compare the results from each solution. \n\nSolution 1: 26\nSolution 2: 13\nSolution 3: 13\n\nThe best solution is either Solution 2 or Solution 3. They both have the correct answer. However, Solution 2 uses the combination formula, which is a more direct and efficient way to calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color. Solution 3 also calculates the number of ways correctly but uses a more complicated method. \n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 2. The index number of the best solution is 2.",
  "solution": "The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue.  If the socks are white, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are brown, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are blue, there is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ choice.  So the total number of choices for socks is $6 + 6 + 1 = \\boxed{13}$.",
