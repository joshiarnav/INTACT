    "To find the number of ways George can choose two colors out of seven, we can use the combination formula. \n\nThe combination formula is given by: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items and k is the number of items being chosen.\n\nIn this case, we have n = 7 (seven colors) and k = 2 (choosing two colors).\n\nFirst, let's calculate 7!: 7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040\n\nNext, let's calculate 2!: 2! = 2 * 1 = 2\n\nThen, let's calculate (7 - 2)!: (7 - 2)! = 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the combination formula:\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7 - 2)!) = 5040 / (2 * 120) = 5040 / 240 = 21\n\nSo, the number of ways George can choose two colors out of seven is 21.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: $\\boxed{21}$",
    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We have 7 colors that George can choose from.\n2. George needs to choose 2 colors out of these 7.\n3. Since the order in which he chooses the colors doesn't matter, we're dealing with combinations.\n4. The formula for combinations is given by C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n   - n is the total number of items to choose from (7 colors in this case).\n   - k is the number of items to choose (2 colors in this case).\n5. Applying the formula, we get:\n   C(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!)\n   = 7! / (2! * 5!)\n   = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n   = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1)\n   = 21\n\nTherefore, George can choose two out of seven colors in $\\boxed{21}$ ways.",
    "To find the number of ways George can choose two colors out of seven, we will use the concept of combinations. This is because the order in which he chooses the colors does not matter.\n\nThe formula for combinations is given by:\n\nnCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of items (in this case, colors),\n- k is the number of items being chosen (in this case, 2 colors),\n- n! is the factorial of n (which means multiplying all whole numbers from n down to 1),\n- k! is the factorial of k,\n- (n-k)! is the factorial of (n-k).\n\nFor this problem, we have n = 7 and k = 2.\n\nSo, the calculation will be:\n\n7C2 = 7! / (2!(7-2)!)\n= (7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / ((2 \u00d7 1) \u00d7 (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1))\n= (7 \u00d7 6) / (2 \u00d7 1)\n= 21\n\nTherefore, there are 21 ways for George to choose two out of seven colors to paint his room.\n\n$\\boxed{21}$"

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 1. \n\nHere's why: \n\nAll three solutions are correct and yield the same answer, 21. However, Solution 1 presents the calculations in a more explicit and step-by-step manner, making it easier to follow and understand. It also clearly labels the intermediate calculations, which can be helpful for readers who want to verify the results.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is 1.",
