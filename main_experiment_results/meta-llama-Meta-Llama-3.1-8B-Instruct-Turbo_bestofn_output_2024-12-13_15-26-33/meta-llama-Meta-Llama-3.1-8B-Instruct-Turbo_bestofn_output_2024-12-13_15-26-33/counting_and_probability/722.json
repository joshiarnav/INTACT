    "To find the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace, we can break down the problem into two steps.\n\nStep 1: Find the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$.\n\nIn a standard deck of 52 cards, there are 13 $\\diamondsuit$ cards. So, the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ is:\n$\\frac{13}{52}$\n\nStep 2: Find the probability that the second card is an ace given that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$.\n\nIf the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$, there are two possibilities:\n- If it is the ace of $\\diamondsuit$, then there will be 3 aces left in the remaining 51 cards.\n- If it is a $\\diamondsuit$ but not the ace, then there will be 4 aces left in the remaining 51 cards.\n\nHowever, we need to account for both cases with their respective probability. Since the first card is equally likely to be the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ or any other $\\diamondsuit$, we have:\n- Probability that the first card is the ace of $\\diamondsuit$: $\\frac{1}{13}$\n- Probability that the first card is any other $\\diamondsuit$: $\\frac{12}{13}$\n\nFor the first case (the ace of $\\diamondsuit$), the probability that the second card is an ace is: \n$\\frac{3}{51}$\n\nFor the second case (any other $\\diamondsuit$), the probability that the second card is an ace is: \n$\\frac{4}{51}$\n\nSo, the probability that the second card is an ace given that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ is the weighted sum of these two cases:\n$(\\frac{1}{13})(\\frac{3}{51}) + (\\frac{12}{13})(\\frac{4}{51})$\n\nCombining this with the probability of the first card being a $\\diamondsuit$, we get the overall probability as follows:\n$\\frac{13}{52} * [(\\frac{1}{13})(\\frac{3}{51}) + (\\frac{12}{13})(\\frac{4}{51})]$\n= $\\frac{1}{4} * [(\\frac{1}{17}) + (\\frac{16}{17})]$\n= $\\frac{1}{4} * \\frac{17}{17}$ \n= $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$",
    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: The probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$. \nIn a standard deck of 52 cards, there are 13 cards that are diamonds ($\\diamondsuit$). Therefore, the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ is $\\frac{13}{52}$.\n\nStep 2: We now have two cases to consider, depending on whether the first card was the ace of diamonds ($\\diamondsuit$) or not.\n\n   a. Case 1: The first card was the ace of diamonds ($\\diamondsuit$). In this case, there are 12 $\\diamondsuit$ cards left in the deck and 3 aces remaining. The probability that the second card is an ace is $\\frac{3}{51}$.\n\n   b. Case 2: The first card was not the ace of diamonds ($\\diamondsuit$). In this case, there are 13 $\\diamondsuit$ cards left in the deck (including the ace of diamonds) and 3 aces remaining. The probability that the second card is an ace is $\\frac{3}{51}$.\n\nStep 3: Since these two cases are mutually exclusive, we can combine the probabilities by finding the sum of their probabilities.\n\n   The probability that the first card is the ace of diamonds is $\\frac{1}{52}$. The probability that the first card is not the ace of diamonds is $\\frac{12}{52}$.\n\n   Therefore, the overall probability of drawing an ace in the second position is:\n   $\\frac{1}{52} \\cdot \\frac{3}{51} + \\frac{12}{52} \\cdot \\frac{3}{51}$\n\nSimplifying the above expression, we get:\n$\\frac{3}{2652} + \\frac{36}{2652} = \\frac{39}{2652} = \\frac{1}{68}$\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{68}}$",
    "To find the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace, let's break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Probability of the first card being a $\\diamondsuit$:\n- There are 52 cards in total.\n- 13 of those cards are $\\diamondsuit$ (one from each suit).\n- Therefore, the probability of the first card being a $\\diamondsuit$ is $\\frac{13}{52}$.\n\nStep 2: There are two cases to consider - either the first card is an ace of $\\diamondsuit$ or it is not.\n\nCase 1: First card is the ace of $\\diamondsuit$.\n- The probability of this happening in step 1 is $\\frac{1}{52}$.\n- After this, there are 51 cards left.\n- 3 of these cards are aces.\n- So the probability of getting an ace in the second draw, given the first card is the ace of $\\diamondsuit$, is $\\frac{3}{51}$.\n- The probability of this case is then $\\frac{1}{52} \\cdot \\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{3}{2652}$.\n\nCase 2: The first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ that is not an ace.\n- The probability of this in step 1 is $\\frac{12}{52}$.\n- After this, there are 51 cards left.\n- 4 of these cards are aces.\n- So the probability of getting an ace in the second draw, given the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ that is not an ace, is $\\frac{4}{51}$.\n- The probability of this case is then $\\frac{12}{52} \\cdot \\frac{4}{51} = \\frac{48}{2652}$.\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of these two cases together to get the overall probability.\n\n$\\frac{3}{2652} + \\frac{48}{2652} = \\frac{51}{2652}$\n\nTo simplify this, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.\n\n$\\frac{51}{2652} = \\frac{17}{884}$\n\nThe probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace is $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{884}}$."
