    "To find the number of different ways to choose six people and seat them at the table, let's break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Choose six people out of seven. This is a combination problem, and we can use the formula for combinations: $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$. In this case, $n = 7$ and $r = 6$. So, the number of ways to choose six people out of seven is:\n\n$\\binom{7}{6} = \\frac{7!}{6!(7-6)!} = 7$\n\nStep 2: Arrange the six chosen people in a circle. This is a permutation problem, but we need to divide by the number of rotations to avoid counting the same arrangement multiple times. A circle has $6$ possible rotations, so we divide by $6$.\n\nThere are $6! = 720$ ways to arrange six people in a line. However, in a circle, the starting point does not matter, so we have $6$ different starting points for each arrangement. Therefore, the number of different ways to seat six people at the table is $\\frac{6!}{6} = 120$.\n\nNow, to get the total number of ways to choose six people and seat them at the table, we multiply the number of ways to choose six people and the number of ways to seat them:\n\n$7 \\times 120 = 840$\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{840}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Choose 6 people out of 7. This can be done in $\\binom{7}{6}= \\boxed{7}$ ways, because we are choosing one person to be left out.\n\nStep 2: Consider the 6 chosen people. There are 6 ways to select a person to sit in a specific seat, then we have 5 people left, who can be arranged around the table in 5! ways for a total of $6\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{720}$ ways for a specific seating arrangement of the 6 chosen people.\n\nStep 3: To get the total number of distinct seatings, we multiply the number of ways to choose the 6 people and the number of ways to seat the 6 chosen people, then divide by 6 to account for the rotation symmetry. Therefore, the total number of ways to seat the 6 chosen people is $\\frac{7\\cdot 720}{6}=\\boxed{840}$.\n\nSo the final answer is $\\boxed{840}$."

  "solution": "There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing.  To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person.  This suggests that there are $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people.  However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count.  Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table.  There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.",
