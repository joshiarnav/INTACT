    "To find the probability that Jane wins, we will consider all the possible combinations of numbers Jane and her brother can spin. Since each spinner has five congruent sectors, there are $5 \\times 5 = 25$ possible combinations.\n\nNow let's consider the combinations where Jane wins. We can start by the number that Jane spins and then count the number of combinations where the difference with the numbers Jane's brother spins is less than 3.\n\n1. If Jane spins 1, her brother can spin 1, 2, or 3, so there are 3 ways Jane wins for this case.\n\n2. If Jane spins 2, her brother can spin 1, 2, 3, or 4, so there are 4 ways Jane wins for this case.\n\n3. If Jane spins 3, her brother can spin 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, so there are 5 ways Jane wins for this case.\n\n4. If Jane spins 4, her brother can spin 2, 3, or 4, so there are 3 ways Jane wins for this case.\n\n5. If Jane spins 5, there are no ways Jane wins, as the difference would be greater than or equal to 3 for any possible number.\n\nWe have considered all the combinations where Jane wins. In total, we have 3 + 4 + 5 + 3 = 15 combinations where Jane wins.\n\nThe total number of combinations where Jane wins and where she loses are 25 and 10 respectively.\n\nThus the probability that Jane wins is $\\frac{15}{25} = \\frac{3}{5}.$\nSo the answer in the required format  is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$.",
    "Since there are five congruent sectors, the probability of each number from 1 to 5 occurring is 1/5.\n\nWe need to calculate the total number of outcomes where Jane wins. This will occur if the non-negative difference of their numbers is less than 3.\n\nWe can break this problem down into cases.\n\nCase 1: Jane and her brother both spin the same number.\n\n- This will occur with a probability of 5/25 = 1/5, because there are 5 pairs of numbers that will occur with the same number (1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5).\n\nCase 2: Jane and her brother spin two different numbers that differ by 1.\n\n- This will occur with a probability of 4/25, as there are 4 pairs of numbers with a difference of 1 (1-2, 2-1, 2-3, 3-2, 3-4, 4-3, 4-5, 5-4). But the pairs 1-2 and 2-1 are the same, as are the pairs 3-4 and 4-3, and 4-5 and 5-4. So we divide by 2 to get 4/25.\n\nCase 3: Jane and herald spin two different numbers that differ by 2.\n\n- This will also occur with a probability of 4/25, as there are 4 pairs of numbers with a difference of 2 (1-3, 3-1, 2-4, 4-2, 3-5, 5-3, 4-6 no - 4-6 is not on the spinner - so we get 2-5, and 5-2). With the same logic, we have 2.\n\nAdding up the probabilities from the three cases, we get:\n\n(1/5) + (4/25) + (4/25) = (1/5) + (8/25)\n= ((5/25) + (8/25))\n= (13/25)\n\nSo the probability that Jane wins is 13/25.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{25}}$",
    "To calculate the probability of Jane winning, we need to consider all possible combinations of numbers that Jane and her brother can spin.\n\nThere are 5 possible numbers that can be spun: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nWe will enumerate each possible combination of spins and determine the winning status.

  "solution": "We consider the unordered pairs, or sets, of spins for which the difference of the numbers are greater than or equal to 3, or those games which Jane loses. These can only occur in the sets $\\{1, 4\\}$, $\\{1, 5 \\}$ or $\\{ 2, 5 \\}$. Each of these unordered pairs can occur in 2 orderings (depending on whether Jane or her brother spins each number).
