    "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware and the number of ways to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware:\nThere are 18 pieces of silverware in total. When choosing 3, we are essentially choosing 3 out of 18. The formula for this is the combination:\n$C(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$\nWhere n is the total number of items (18), r is the number of items chosen (3), and \"!\" denotes factorial.\nTotal ways to choose 3 pieces = $C(18, 3) = \\frac{18!}{3!(18-3)!} = \\frac{18 \\times 17 \\times 16}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 816$\n\nNumber of ways to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife:\nThere are 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives. We need to choose one of each from each category, so we multiply the number of ways to choose one item from each category.\nForks: 6 ways\nSpoons: 6 ways\nKnives: 6 ways\nTotal ways to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife = 6 x 6 x 6 = 216\n\nProbability of getting one fork, one spoon, and one knife:\nTo find the probability, we divide the number of desired outcomes (216) by the total number of possible outcomes (816).\nProbability = $\\frac{216}{816} = \\frac{27}{102} = \\frac{9}{34}$\n\nSo, the probability of getting one fork, one spoon, and one knife is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{34}}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. We have 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives in the drawer, making a total of 18 pieces of silverware. So, the total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware out of 18 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[ 18 \\ choose 3 = \\frac{18!}{3! \\times (18-3)!} = \\frac{18!}{3! \\times 15!} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ = \\frac{18 \\times 17 \\times 16}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} \\]\n\n\\[ = 816 \\]\n\n2. Now, let's count the number of ways to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife. There are 6 ways to choose a fork, 6 ways to choose a spoon, and 6 ways to choose a knife. So, the total number of ways to choose one piece of each type of silverware is:\n\n6 (ways to choose a fork) \u00d7 6 (ways to choose a spoon) \u00d7 6 (ways to choose a knife) = 216\n\n3. To find the probability of choosing one fork, one spoon, and one knife, we divide the number of ways to choose one piece of each type of silverware (216) by the total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware (816):\n\nProbability = 216 / 816 = 27 / 102 = 9 / 34\n\nSo, the probability that you get one fork, one spoon, and one knife is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{34}}$.",
    "To find the probability of getting one fork, one spoon, and one knife, we can use the concept of combinations and the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible outcomes. There are a total of 18 pieces of silverware (6 forks + 6 spoons + 6 knives), and we are drawing 3 pieces. So, the total number of possible outcomes is given by the combination formula:\n\n18C3 = (18 * 17 * 16) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 816\n\nNow, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to get one fork, one spoon, and one knife.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife is given by the product of the number of ways to choose one piece of each type:\n\n6C1 * 6C1 * 6C1 = 6 * 6 * 6 = 216\n\nNow, we can find the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\nProbability = 216 / 816\nProbability = 27/102\nProbability = 9/34\n\nSo, the probability of getting one fork, one spoon, and one knife is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{9}{34}}$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and yield the same result. \n\nHowever, Solution 1 is the most detailed and provides a clear explanation of the combination formula, which makes it easier to understand for someone who may not be familiar with the concept.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1.",
  "solution": "First, we can find the denominator of our fraction.  There are a total of $\\dbinom{18}{3}=816$ ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware out of 18.  To find the numerator, we need to count the number of ways to choose one piece of each type of silverware.  There are 6 ways we could choose a fork, 6 ways to choose a spoon, and 6 ways to choose a knife, making a total of $6\\cdot 6 \\cdot 6=216$ ways to choose a fork, a knife, and a spoon so our final probability is $\\frac{216}{816}=\\boxed{\\frac{9}{34}}$.",
