    "To find the difference between the total number of green tiles and the total number of blue tiles in the new figure, we should follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the total number of blue and green tiles in the original figure. The original figure has 13 blue and 6 green tiles.\n\n2. Determine the number of green tiles needed to create the border of the new figure. The old border used to create the figure was made of blue tiles (not green tiles), so in order to change the color to green, more green tiles will be required. \n   - There are 3 rows and each row needs 3 green tiles (from the inner edge to the outer edge of the middle blue tile), plus a green tile on each of the other end squares for the border which is present on two sides of the figure.\n   - This means there are a total of 3*3+2*3 =  13 green tiles needed for the border.\n\n   - 13 blue tiles made the original border (the inner row), so for the new figure, 13 more green tiles (the old border now re-sized and used, in this new larger hexagonal figure), will be used at the border (the original inner row of blue is not being changed, to green now).  Hence there will be a total of 6+13= 19 green tiles in new border of this new figure.\n\n   - Now that we know the number of green tiles and how many blue tiles are needed to make a border of a specific size: There is no need to change the non-edge (non dimensional blue tiles), so 13 of them are not added to - (the new figure will just use the same blue non-edge tiles used in the prior figure)\n   - Total blue tiles is 13 in this new figure too. \n   So, in the new figure, the difference between the total number of green tiles and the total number of blue tiles is 19 - 13 = 6.\n\n$\\boxed{6}$",
    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\n1.  Initially, there are 13 blue tiles and 6 green tiles. \n\n2.  To add a border of green tiles around the figure, we will have to add green tiles along the edges of the figure.\n\n3.  A complete outer border of green tiles around the figure requires 6 tiles on each side that is not a side of the outer border for each of the tiles on the outer border, since it will go through every single tile in the interior.\n\n4.  The original figure can be divided into 7 individual hexagons as shown below.  For each individual hexagon, we add 6 green tiles along the edges, but 6 of the tiles of these edges are actually the tiles bordering on  the interior tiles.\n\n5.  So, the first step is to calculate the increase in the total number of tiles after the border is added, which is the sum of the interior tiles plus the tiles added along the edges. \n\n6.  Each of the seven interior tiles contributes to a side with two green tiles (on adjacent hexagons) per interior tile on the exterior (yielding 14 green tiles in total for the interior edges of  a hexagon).\n\n7.  There are 7 hexagons in this figure. Since each hexagon will add 14 green tiles, we can multiply 7 by 14, which gives us 98 green tiles.\n\n8.  Given the 6 green tiles that were already present in the figure, the total number of green tiles in the new figure will be $98+6=104$.\n\n9.  However, we did not add any new blue tiles in the border bordering the interior, so the number of blue tiles remains the same at 13.\n\n10. Therefore, the difference in the total number of green tiles and the total number of blue tiles in the new figure is $104-13=91$, so the answer is \\boxed{91}."
