    "To find the probability that the two-digit number $ab$ and both digits $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 3, we need to first identify the possible combinations of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy this condition.\n\nFor $a$ and $b$ to be divisible by 3, the possible values of $a$ and $b$ are:\n\n- $a = 3, 6$ and $b = 3, 6$\n- $a = 6$ and $b = 3, 6$\n\nThe possible combinations of $(a, b)$ are:\n\n- $(3, 3)$\n- $(3, 6)$\n- $(6, 3)$\n- $(6, 6)$\n\nThere are 4 possible combinations of $(a, b)$ that satisfy the condition.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when two fair 6-sided dice are tossed is:\n\n- Each die has 6 possible outcomes, so the total number of outcomes is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\nThe probability that the two-digit number $ab$ and both digits $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 3 is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n\n$\\frac{4}{36} = \\frac{1}{9}.$\n\nThus, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$.",
    "To solve the problem, we need to consider the cases where the two-digit number $ab$ and the individual digits $a$ and $b$ are all divisible by 3.\n\nA two-digit number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. For a two-digit number $ab$, the sum of its digits is $a + b$.\n\nNow, let's consider each possible case:\n\n1. $a = 3, b = 3$. In this case, the sum of the digits $a + b$ is 6, which is divisible by 3. So the two-digit number $ab$ is also divisible by 3.\n2. $a = 3, b = 6$. The sum of the digits $a + b$ is 9, which is divisible by 3.\n3. $a = 3, b = 9$. The sum of the digits $a + b$ is 12, which is divisible by 3.\n4. $a = 6, b = 3$. This case is the same as case 2.\n5. $a = 6, b = 6$. The sum of the digits $a + b$ is 12, which is divisible by 3.\n6. $a = 6, b = 9$. This case is the same as case 3.\n7. $a = 9, b = 3$.

The sum of the digits $a + b$ is 18, which is divisible by 3.\n\nSince there are 9 cases where the two-digit number $ab$ and the individual digits $a$ and $b$ are all divisible by 3, the total number of favorable outcomes is 9.\n\nWhen two fair 6-sided dice are tossed, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\nThe probability = 9 / 36 = 1 / 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{1/4}$."

  "solution": "$ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) is divisible by 3 only when $a+b$ is divisible by 3. Since 3 divides both $a$ and $a+b$, 3 must divide $b$. Therefore, $a$ and $b$ can equal 3 or 6. The probability that $a$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. The probability that $b$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. Therefore, The probability that both $a$ and $b$ equal 3 or 6 is $\\left(\\frac13\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac19}$.",
