    "To find the number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The largest difference will be when we subtract the smallest number from the largest number in the set. The largest difference is $16 - 1 = 15$.\n\n2. The smallest difference will be when we take two consecutive numbers from the set. The smallest difference is $2 - 1 = 1$.\n\n3. Now, we can see that we can form all the numbers between 1 and 15, inclusive, as a difference of two distinct members of the set. This is because $16 - n$ gives us a positive integer for $n$ ranging from 1 to 15.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{15}$ different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set.",
    "To find the different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 14, 15, 16 \\}$, we need to consider the possible differences.\n\nThe largest difference will be obtained by subtracting the smallest number from the largest number in the set, which is $16-1=15$. \n\nSince we want distinct members of the set, we will consider differences from 1 to 15, because those are the possible values. \n\nThe smallest difference will be $2 - 1 = 1$. \n\nThis implies that every integer from 1 to 15 is a possible difference, since we have identified the smallest and the largest differences.\n\nTherefore, the different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n\nHence, the answer is $\\boxed{15}$.",
    "To find the different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 14, 15, 16 \\},$ let's consider how differences work with sets of consecutive integers.\n\n- The smallest possible difference is $1$, which occurs when you subtract consecutive integers (e.g., $2-1=1$).\n- The largest possible difference in the given set is $16-1=15.$\n\nWe want to know how many other distinct differences are possible. We realize that we can find the remaining differences by calculating the number of non-zero differences.\n\nWe can think about the problem by reversing the subtraction of the two values in the set and keep track of how the differences change by reqriting the problem as follows $|x_2 - x_1| = (x_2 + x_1) - (x_2 - x_1) $.\n\nIt turns out that this new formula $(x_2 + x_1)$ is the sum of two numbers while $(x_2 - x_1)$ is the difference. Since the sum can be from 3 to 32, the difference can be between 0 and 29, but when you want an answer $|x_2-x_1| where $x_2 >x_1$ $|x_2-x_1|$ can vary between 0 and 15.\n\nThus there are 16-0+1= $16-Ans:$  $\\boxed{16}$"

  "critique": "1 \n\nSolution 1 is the best solution as it directly addresses the problem and provides a clear and concise explanation of how to find the number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set. It correctly identifies the largest and smallest differences and shows that all numbers between 1 and 15 can be formed as a difference of two distinct members of the set.",
  "solution": "We can see that the maximum positive difference is $16 - 1 = 15.$ Some quick calculations show that we can get all values between $1$ and $15.$ \\begin{align*}\n16 - 1 &= 15 \\\\\n16 - 2 &= 14 \\\\\n16 - 3 &= 13 \\\\\n& \\ \\,\\vdots \\\\\n16-14&=2\\\\\n16-15&=1\n\\end{align*} Therefore there are $\\boxed{15}$ different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 14, 15, 16 \\}.$",
