    "To find the perimeter of an equilateral triangle in simplest radical form, we need to find the length of one side first. Given that the area of the triangle is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides (let's call this length $s$), we can set up the equation as follows:\n\nThe formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{s^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$. \n\nSince the area is equal to the side length $s$, we have:\n\n$\\frac{s^2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = s$\n\nWe can multiply both sides by $4$ to eliminate the fraction:\n\n$s^2\\sqrt{3} = 4s$\n\nNext, we can rearrange the equation to get:\n\n$s^2\\sqrt{3} - 4s = 0$\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to factor out the common factor $s$:\n\n$s(\\sqrt{3}s - 4) = 0$\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\n$1.$ $s = 0$\n\n$2.$ $\\sqrt{3}s - 4 = 0$\n\nSince a side length cannot be zero, we discard the first solution. Solving the second equation for $s$ gives us:\n\n$\\sqrt{3}s - 4 = 0$\n\n$\\sqrt{3}s = 4$\n\nDivide both sides by $\\sqrt{3}$:\n\n$s = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nRationalize the denominator by multiplying and dividing by $\\sqrt{3}$:\n\n$s = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\n$s = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}$\n\nNow that we have found the length of one side, we can find the perimeter of the equilateral triangle by multiplying the side length by 3:\n\nPerimeter $= 3s$\n\nPerimeter $= 3\\cdot\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}$\n\nPerimeter $= 4\\sqrt{3}$\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$ units.",

    "To find the perimeter of the equilateral triangle, we first need to find the length of one side. \n\nSince the area of the equilateral triangle is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides, we can set up an equation: \n\nArea = side \n\nThe formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is (sqrt(3)/4) * side^2, where side is the length of the side. So we can set up the equation: \n\n(sqrt(3)/4) * side^2 = side \n\nMultiplying both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction gives us: \n\nsqrt(3) * side^2 = 4 * side \n\nSubtracting 4 * side from both sides gives us: \n\nsqrt(3) * side^2 - 4 * side = 0 \n\nFactoring out side, we get: \n\nside * (sqrt(3) * side - 4) = 0 \n\nSetting each factor equal to 0, we get two possible solutions: \n\nside = 0 (invalid, because a side can't be 0) \n\nor \n\nsqrt(3) * side - 4 = 0 \n\nAdding 4 to both sides gives us: \n\nsqrt(3) * side = 4 \n\nDividing both sides by sqrt(3) gives us: \n\nside = 4 / sqrt(3) \n\nRationalizing the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by sqrt(3) gives us: \n\nside = (4 * sqrt(3)) / 3 \n\nNow that we have the length of one side, we can find the perimeter by multiplying the side by 3: \n\nPerimeter = side * 3 \n\nPerimeter = (4 * sqrt(3)) / 3 * 3 \n\nPerimeter = 4 * sqrt(3) \n\nSo the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 4 * sqrt(3) units. \n\n$\\boxed{4 \\sqrt{3}}$"
