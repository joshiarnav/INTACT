    "To find the equation of line $L$, we need to determine its slope and then find the equation of the line using the point-slope or slope-intercept form.\n\nFirst, let's find the slope of the line by examining the change in x and y-coordinates of the images of points $A$ and $A'$.\n\nThe x-coordinate of $A$ remains the same for $A'$, while the y-coordinate changes from 3 to -5. Similarly, for $B$ and $B'$, the x-coordinate of $B$ remains the same, while the y-coordinate changes from 8 to -10. This indicates a vertical movement in the line $L$ for both pairs of points.\n\nSince vertical lines have a slope of 'undefined', and all points on the line are reflected over this vertical line to reach the line of the new points, this horizontal line must have the same y-coordinate for the points and its image.\n\nLooking at the coordinates of the points and their images, we can see that the y-coordinates change from 3 and 8 to -5 and -10, and from 6 to -8. The common y-coordinate of the line for $A$ and $A'$ is -1. Noting that the $y$-value is what has changed between the points of the original triangle and the reflected triangle, the y-coordinates must be equal for points that lie on this line. We do see the number -1 again with point C', so by factoring that out and making the $y$ constant we can write the equation. \n\nThis line has a y-coordinate of -1, which means the equation of line $L$ is:\n\ny = -1.\n\nThis is the required format. \n\nThe equation is $\\boxed{y = -1}$.",
    "To find the equation of line $L$, we need to determine its position and orientation. \n\nSince the reflection of a point across a line results in equal distances between the original point and the line, these distances must be the same for each point. We can consider the change in the $y$-coordinates of the points, as a reflection about a line would only change the $y$-coordinate, not the $x$-coordinate. \n\nNow, let's calculate the change in the $y$-coordinate for each point: \n\n- A: From (2, 3) to (2, -5), the change is 3 - (-5) = 8.\n- B: From (7, 8) to (7, -10), the change is 8 - (-10) = 18.\n- C: From (-4, 6) to (-4, -8), the change is 6 - (-8) = 14.\n\nAs these points are reflections of each other across line $L$, the line must be equidistant from the points. We can see that the change in $y$-coordinate for each point is twice the change in the $y$-coordinate for point $A$, which suggests that the midpoint of the line segment joining the original point $A$ and its reflection $A'$ might lie on line $L$. \n\nNow let's find the midpoint: \n\\[ \\left(\\frac{x_{A}}{2}+\\frac{x_{A'}}{2},\\frac{y_{A}}{2}+\\frac{y_{A'}}{2}\\right) = (2,3), (\\frac{2+2}{2},\\frac{3+(-5)}{2}) \\]\n\nnow simplifying \n\\[(2,(-1)) \\]\n\nThis midpoint, $(2, -1)$, must lie on line $L$. To find the equation of the line, we can use the slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. \n\nHowever, as the line is horizontal, the slope $m$ will be zero, and since the point $(2,-1)$ lies on it, we can use $y = b$ to find $b$. Thus, \n$ -1 = b \\\\ b = -1 \\\\ $ \n\nTherefore, the equation of the line $L$ is \n$ \\boxed{y=-1}$"

  "solution": "Since only the $y$ portions of the coordinates move, we know that the line of reflection must be a horizontal line. Now we just need to find the midpoint between an original point and its reflected image to pinpoint the location of the line. The $y$-coordinate of point $A$ is 3 and the $y$-coordinate of $A'$ is $-5$; therefore, the midpoint is at $(2, -1)$. The line of refection is $\\boxed{y = -1}$.",
