    "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of segment AE in terms of the given conditions.\n\nLet's start by considering the lengths of the various segments in the given square.\n\nSince we're given a square with a side length of 1 unit, let's label the lengths as follows:\n\n- $AE = CF = x$ units\n- $BE = BF = 1 - x$ units\n- $DE = DF = 1$ unit (as the lengths of the square's sides)\n- $EF = y$ units (as we are calculating for it later on)\n\nNow, when the square is folded such that sides $AD$ and $CD$ coincide and lie on the diagonal $BD$, the sum of the segments $AD$ and $DC$ becomes equal to the length of diagonal $BD$.\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n- $(1) + (1) = (DE + EF + FD)$\n\nNow, as the given folding is along line $DE$ and $DF$; the length of segment $EF$ would be $x + (1 - x) = 1$\n\nSimilarly, as the segment $DE$ is part of the line along which the folding occurs; when folding along line $DE$, the segment $AD$ and $CD$ would coincide with diagonal $BD$ thus, $AD + DC = BD$\n\nThis implies that:\n- $AD + DC + AD = BD$ \n\nSubstituting the calculated value for $DC + AD$:\n$BD = 2 \\times AD = 2 \\times DC = \\sqrt{2}$ units\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem for $\\triangle AFD$, the relationship can be expressed as:\n\n$(AD)^2 = (AF)^2 + (FD)^2$\n\n$(1)^2 = (AF)^2 + (1)^2$\n\n$(AF)^2 = 0$\n\n$AF = 0$\n\nSince, given that the folding aligns $AD$ with diagonal $BD$ which intersects $DC$, and also, it creates an isosceles right triangle when folded with the square; there must be $DC = 1$; As both the segments $AD$ and $DC$ coincide and are equal to length of the diagonal $BD$;\n- $(DC)^2 = (BD)^2 - (DE)^2$ \n\n$(1)^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2 - (1)^2$ \n\nSimplifying it gives the equation $(1)^2 = 2 - 1$ which is always true.\n\nUpon closer inspection of this equation we can get the lengths of the sides as an expression:\nFinding the relationship for $x$ (which is equal to $AE = CF = x$ units) in terms of given conditions; consider $\\triangle BCF$ in which $CF = x$ and $CB = 1 - x$\nTherefore the same equation for $\\triangle CFB$ becomes: \n\n- $(1 - x)^2 + x^2 = 1$ units \n\nSimplifying this we get:\n- $1 + 2x - 2x^2 = 1$ \n\nThis gives an equation in terms of $x$: \n\n$2x^2 - 2x = 0$\n\nFactorizing $2x$ from the equation gives: \n\n$x(2x-2) = 0$\n\nTherefore there are two solutions; where either $x=0$ or $x=1$; however this would be an illogical value in the real world problem; which would end up making length of $AE$ zero.\n\n-Dividing both the sides by $(2x-2)$ which is not equal to zero as $x=0$; the equation for length $x$ becomes $x = \\sqrt{2}-1$\n\nTherefore the length of segment $AE$ is $\\sqrt{2}-1$ units. \n\nHence the value of integer $k+m$ would be $2+1$ which equals $3$; as $k = 2$ and $m = 1$.\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",
    "To find the length of segment AE, we'll follow the steps below:\n\n1. **Identify the given information and the goal**: We have a square ABCD with side length 1 unit.

  "solution": "We start by drawing a diagram.  When the paper is folded, sides $AD$ and $CD$ coincide on the longer dashed line, and points $A$ and $C$ meet at $G$, as you can see below.  [asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(1,.4)); draw((0,0)--(.4,1));\ndraw((1,.4)--(.4,1),dashed);\ndraw((0,0)--(.7,.7),dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,1), NW); label(\"$B$\",(1,1), NE); label(\"$C$\",(1,0), SE); label(\"$D$\",(0,0), SW);\nlabel(\"$F$\",(1,.4), E); label(\"$E$\",(.4,1), N);\nlabel(\"$G$\",(.7,.7), NE);\n[/asy] Now, we assign variables.  We are looking for the length of $AE$, so let $AE=x$.  Then, $BE=1-x$.  Because of the symmetry of the square and the fold, everything to the left of line $BD$ is a mirror image of everything to the right of $BD$.  Thus, $\\triangle BEF$ is an isosceles right triangle (45-45-90), so $EF=\\sqrt{2}EB = \\sqrt{2}(1-x)$.  Also, $\\triangle EGB$ and $\\triangle FGB$ are congruent 45-45-90 triangles, so $GB = \\frac{EB}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nAlso, notice that because the way the paper is folded (its original position versus its final position), we have more congruent triangles, $\\triangle AED \\cong \\triangle GED$.  This means that $AD=GD=1$.\n\nLastly, notice that since $G$ is on $BD$, we have $BD=BG+GD$. $BD$ is a diagonal of the square, so it has side length $\\sqrt{2}$, $GD=1$, and $GB = \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}$.  Thus, our equation becomes \\[\\sqrt{2} = 1 + \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}.\\] Multiplying both sides by $\\sqrt{2}$ yields $2=\\sqrt{2}+1-x$; solving for $x$ yields $x=\\sqrt{2}-1$.  Thus, $AE=\\sqrt{2}-1=\\sqrt{k}-m$, and we see that $k+m=2+1=\\boxed{3}$.",
