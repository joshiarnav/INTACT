    "To compute $\\sin 60^\\circ$, we need to consider a right-angled triangle with angles $30^\\circ$, $60^\\circ$, and $90^\\circ$. We can use the properties of this special triangle to find the sine of $60^\\circ$.\n\nStep 1: Recall the properties of the 30-60-90 triangle. In such a triangle, the side opposite the $30^\\circ$ angle is half the length of the hypotenuse, and the side opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the side opposite the $30^\\circ$ angle.\n\nStep 2: Consider a right triangle with angle measurements of $30^\\circ$, $60^\\circ$, and $90^\\circ$. Let's denote the length of the side opposite the $30^\\circ$ angle as 1. Then, the length of the side opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle is $\\sqrt{3}$, and the length of the hypotenuse is 2.\n\nStep 3: Recall the definition of the sine function: $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}$. In this case, the sine of $60^\\circ$ is the ratio of the side opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle to the hypotenuse.\n\nStep 4: Since the length of the side opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle is $\\sqrt{3}$, and the length of the hypotenuse is 2, we can compute the sine of $60^\\circ$ as:\n\n$\\sin 60^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$",
    "To compute $\\sin 60^\\circ$, we'll use the unit circle and the definition of sine as the y-coordinate of a point on the unit circle. \n\nStep 1: Recall the special triangles associated with the unit circle. In this case, we'll use the 30-60-90 triangle.\n\nStep 2: Determine the side lengths of the 30-60-90 triangle. The hypotenuse (opposite the 90-degree angle) is 2 (1 unit from the origin), the side opposite the 60-degree angle (the side we're interested in) will have a length of $\\sqrt{3}$ (because of the special side lengths of a 30-60-90 triangle), and the side opposite the 30-degree angle will have a length of 1.\n\nStep 3: Recognize that the $\\sin 60^\\circ$ is equivalent to the $\\frac{\\text{opposite side}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}$ ratio. In this case, it will be $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$."
