    "To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a few key steps:\n\n1. **Find the relationship between the radius of the circle and the side length of the square:**\nSince each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal to the radius of the circle, we can form an isosceles triangle using the center of the circle and the two endpoints of the chord.\n\nDrawing the radii from the center of the circle to each endpoint of the chord, we get two congruent right triangles.\n\nThe length of the chord (side of the square) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the sum of the squares of the legs of a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse:\n\n\\[ r^2 = \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^2 + h^2 \\]\n\nwhere $r$ is the radius of the circle, $s$ is the side length of the square, and $h$ is the distance from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord (the height of the isosceles triangle).\n\nSince the chord is equal to the radius, the length of the side of the square $s = 2r$.\n\nSubstituting $s = 2r$ into the equation above, we get:\n\n\\[ r^2 = \\left(\\frac{2r}{2}\\right)^2 + h^2 \\]\n\\[ r^2 = r^2 + h^2 \\]\n\nSubtracting $h^2$ from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ r^2 - h^2 = r^2 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation, we can see that:\n\n\\[ h^2 = 0 \\]\n\nThis means that the distance $h$ from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord is 0, which implies that the height of the isosceles triangle is actually the radius of the circle.\n\n2. **Find the area of the square and the circle:**\n\nThe area of the square with side length $s$ is:\n\n\\[ A_{\\text{square}} = s^2 = (2r)^2 = 4r^2 \\]\n\nThe area of the circle with radius $r$ is:\n\n\\[ A_{\\text{circle}} = \\pi r^2 \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle:**\n\nThe ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is given by:\n\n\\[ \\frac{A_{\\text{square}}}{A_{\\text{circle}}} = \\frac{4r^2}{\\pi r^2} \\]\n\nCancelling out the common $r^2$ term, we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{A_{\\text{square}}}{A_{\\text{circle}}} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is:\n\n$$\\boxed{\\frac{4}{\\pi}}$$",
    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of both the square and the circle, and then find their ratio.\n\nLet's consider the circle and call its radius 'r'. \n\nSince each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle, we can create a line segment from the center of the circle to the point where the chord intersects the side of the square. This line segment is also the radius of the circle.\n\nNow, consider the isosceles triangle formed by the center of the circle, and the two points where the circle intersects the square. The base of the triangle is the chord of the circle with a length equal to the radius of the circle, and it's also twice the length of the line segment that cuts the chord in half. Let's call the length of this line segment 'x'.\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, we have r\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (r/2)\u00b2, since the length of the line segment from the center of the circle to the end of the chord is half the length of the chord.\n\nNow, solve for 'x' using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nx\u00b2 = r\u00b2 - (r/2)\u00b2\nx\u00b2 = r\u00b2 - (r\u00b2 / 4)\nx\u00b2 = (4r\u00b2 / 4) - (r\u00b2 / 4)\nx\u00b2 = 3r\u00b2 / 4\nx = \u221a(3r\u00b2 / 4)\nx = (\u221a3)/2 r\n\nNow, we know the length of the line segment that cuts the chord in half is (\u221a3)/2 r. Therefore, the length of the chord is 2*(\u221a3)/2 r = (\u221a3) r.\n\nNow, since the chord is a part of the side of the square, the diagonal of the square (from one corner to the opposite corner) is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is 2r.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of one side of the square. If the length of the side of the square is 's', then the diagonal of the square is \u221a(s\u00b2 + s\u00b2) = s\u221a2.\n\nNow, set the length of the diagonal of the square equal to the diameter of the circle: s\u221a2 = 2r.\n\nNow, divide by \u221a2 to isolate 's', the side of the square:\ns = 2r / \u221a2\ns = 2r * (\u221a2 / \u221a2) \ns = (\u221a2) r\u221a2\ns = (\u221a2 * \u221a2)r\ns = 2r\n\nSo now that we have found 's' which is equal to 2r, we can find the area of the square, which is s\u00b2.\n\nArea of the square = s\u00b2\nArea of the square = (2r)\u00b2\nArea of the square = 4r\u00b2\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle. The area of the circle is \u03c0r\u00b2.\n\nNow we can find the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle.\n\nRatio = (Area of the square)/(Area of the circle)\nRatio = (4r\u00b2)/(\u03c0r\u00b2)\nRatio = 4/\u03c0\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is 4/\u03c0. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{\\pi}}$"

Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.",
