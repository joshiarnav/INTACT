  "problem": "Jimmy owns a cube-shaped container that measures $10$ inches on each side. He fills this container with water until it is half full. Then he throws ten giant ice cubes that measure $2$ inches on each side into the container. In inches cubed, how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water?",

    "To solve this, we first need to find the total volume of the container, the volume of water, the total volume of the ice cubes, and then subtract the total occupied volume from the container's volume.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total volume of the container.**\nSince the container is a cube and each side measures $10$ inches, the volume is given by $side^3 = 10^3 = 1000$ cubic inches.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the volume of water.**\nJimmy fills the container until it is half full. Therefore, the volume of water is half the total volume of the container: $\\frac{1000}{2} = 500$ cubic inches.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the volume of a single ice cube.**\nEach ice cube is a cube with $2$ inches on each side, so the volume of one ice cube is $2^3 = 8$ cubic inches.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total volume of the ten ice cubes.**\nThere are ten ice cubes, each with a volume of $8$ cubic inches, so the total volume of the ice cubes is $10 \\times 8 = 80$ cubic inches.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total occupied volume.**\nWe add the volume of water to the total volume of the ice cubes: $500 + 80 = 580$ cubic inches.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the occupied volume of the container.**\nTo find the unoccupied volume, we need to subtract the total occupied volume from the container's volume: $1000 - 580 = 420$ cubic inches.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{420}$ cubic inches of the container is unoccupied by ice or water.",

    "To find the unoccupied space in the container, we first need to calculate the total volume of the container and the volumes occupied by water and ice.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total volume of the container.\nThe container is cube-shaped with each side measuring 10 inches. \nVolume of container = side * side * side\nVolume of container = 10 * 10 * 10\nVolume of container = 1000 cubic inches\n\nStep 2: Calculate the volume occupied by water.\nThe container is half full of water. \nVolume of water = (1/2) * total volume of container\nVolume of water = (1/2) * 1000\nVolume of water = 500 cubic inches\n\nStep 3: Calculate the volume of one ice cube.\nEach ice cube is also cube-shaped with each side measuring 2 inches. \nVolume of ice cube = side * side * side\nVolume of ice cube = 2 * 2 * 2\nVolume of ice cube = 8 cubic inches\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total volume occupied by ice cubes.\nThere are ten giant ice cubes. \nTotal volume of ice = number of ice cubes * volume of one ice cube\nTotal volume of ice = 10 * 8\nTotal volume of ice = 80 cubic inches\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total occupied volume in the container (water + ice).\nTotal occupied volume = volume of water + total volume of ice\nTotal occupied volume = 500 + 80\nTotal occupied volume = 580 cubic inches\n\nStep 6: Calculate the unoccupied volume in the container.\nUnoccupied volume = total volume of container - total occupied volume\nUnoccupied volume = 1000 - 580\nUnoccupied volume = 420 cubic inches\n\nTherefore, the unoccupied volume in the container is 420 cubic inches.\n\n$\\boxed{420}$"

  "solution": "First let's compute the volume of the container. The container measures $10\\times10\\times10$ so its volume is  $$10\\cdot10\\cdot10=10^3=1000$$inches cubed. Since the container is only half full, there are $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10^3=500$$inches cubed of water in it. Additionally, there are ten ice cubes each with a volume of $2^3$. This means that the total volume of the ice cubes is $$10\\cdot2^3=10\\cdot8=80.$$Altogether, the water and the ice cubes occupy $500+80=580$ inches cubed. This means that there are $1000-580=\\boxed{420}$ inches cubed of space in the container unoccupied by water and ice.",
