    "To find the total surface area of the box, let's denote the length, width, and height of the box as $l$, $w$, and $h$. Given that the sum of the lengths of the twelve edges of the box is $140$, we can write an equation:\n\n$4l + 4w + 4h = 140$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$l + w + h = 35$\n\nNext, the distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner is given as $21$. Using the three-dimensional distance formula (or the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions), we can express this as:\n\n$\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = 21$\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation:\n\n$l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = 441$\n\nNow, let's square the equation $l + w + h = 35$:\n\n$(l + w + h)^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2 + 2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 1225$\n\nNow substitute $l^2 + w^2 + h^2$ with $441$:\n\n$441 + 2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 1225$\n\nSubtract $441$ from both sides:\n\n$2lw + 2lh + 2wh = 784$\n\nDividing both sides by $2$ gives:\n\n$lw + lh + wh = 392$\n\nSince the total surface area of the box is given by $2lw + 2lh + 2wh$, we have:\n\nTotal surface area $= 2(lw + lh + wh)$\n\nTotal surface area $= 2(392)$\n\nTotal surface area $= 784$\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the box is $\\boxed{784}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we'll start by using the given information and letting the dimensions of the rectangular box be $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n\nWe're given that the sum of the lengths of the twelve edges of the rectangular box is $140$. Since there are four edges of each length, we can write:\n\n$4a + 4b + 4c = 140$\n\nWe can simplify this by dividing both sides by 4:\n\n$a + b + c = 35$\n\nNext, we're given that the distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner is $21$. We know this distance can be calculated using the three-dimensional distance formula:\n\n$\\sqrt{(a - a')^2 + (b - b')^2 + (c - c')^2}$\n\nWe can set $a' = a$, $b' = b$, and $c' = c$ since we are finding the distance between the same points. Squaring both sides of the formula and replacing the distance with $21$:\n\n$(a - a)^2 + (b - b)^2 + (c - c)^2 = 21^2$\n\nSimplifying this expression gives us $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 441$.\n\nNow that we have a system of equations involving $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ and $a + b + c$, we'll make use of the identity $(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc)$.\n\nRearranging this identity to isolate $ab + ac + bc$ gives us:\n\n$ab + ac + bc = \\frac{(a + b + c)^2 - a^2 - b^2 - c^2}{2}$\n\nWe know $a + b + c = 35$ and we've determined $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 441$. Substituting this information in gives us:\n\n$ab + ac + bc = \\frac{35^2 - 441}{2}$\n\n$ab + ac + bc = \\frac{1225 - 441}{2}$\n\n$ab + ac + bc = \\frac{784}{2}$\n\n$ab + ac + bc = 392$\n\nWe're tasked with finding the total surface area of the box. This is equal to $2(ab + ac + bc)$. Plugging in the value we found for $ab + ac + bc$:\n\nTotal surface area $= 2(ab + ac + bc)$\n\nTotal surface area $= 2(392)$\n\nTotal surface area $= 784$\n\nSo the total surface area of the box is $\\boxed{784}$."
