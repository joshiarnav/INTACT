    "To find the perimeter of one of the congruent quadrilaterals, we need to find the lengths of its four sides.\n\nThe line $y = x/2$ intersects the square at two points: \n\n1. The point where it intersects the right side of the square: We have $x = a$, and plugging this into the equation for $y$, we get $y = a/2$.\n\n2. The point where it intersects the top side of the square: We have $y = a$, and plugging this into the equation for $x$, we get $x = 2a$.\n\nHowever, the line $y = x/2$ should intersect the line $y = a$ before it intersects the line $x = a$. So, the correct point of intersection between the top side and the line is actually where the line intersects the line $y = a$, and the intersection is $(2a, a)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the other two points of intersection. We already know that the line intersects the right side at $x = a$, so we have $y = a/2$ at that point. To find where the line intersects the left side (at $x = -a$), we plug $x = -a$ into the equation for $y$. This gives us $y = -a/2$.\n\nSo, we have the four vertices of the congruent quadrilateral as:\n\n1. $(-a, a)$\n2. $(a, a)$\n3. $(a, a/2)$\n4. $(-a, -a/2)$\n\nNow, let's find the lengths of the four sides.\n\nSide 1: The length of the vertical side from $y = a$ to $y = a/2$ is:\n$|a - a/2| = |a/2| = a/2$\n\nSide 2: The length of the horizontal side from $(-a, a)$ to $(a, a)$ is:\n$|a - (-a)| = |2a| = 2a$\n\nSide 3: The length of the horizontal side from $(a, a)$ to $(a, a/2)$ is:\n$|a - a| = |0| = 0$ (This side has zero length, since the vertices coincide.)\n\nHowever, this length should be calculated as  the horizontal distance from (a,a) to (a,a/2), which is the length $|a - a/2| = |a/2| = a/2.$\n\nSide 4: The length of the diagonal side from $(-a, -a/2)$ to $(a, a)$ is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length $a - (-a) = 2a$ and $a - (-a/2) = 3a/2.$ Applying the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\\begin{align*} \n&\\text{hypotenuse}^2  = (2a)^2 + (3a/2)^2 \\\\\n&= 4a^2 + 9a^2/4 \\\\\n&= (16 + 9)/4 \\cdot a^2 \\\\\n&= 25/4 \\cdot a^2 \\\\\n&\\text{hypotenuse} = \\sqrt{25/4} \\cdot a \\\\\n&= 5/2 \\cdot a.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo, the perimeter of one of the congruent quadrilaterals is the sum of the four side lengths:\n$2a + a/2 + a/2 + 5a/2  =  9a/2.$\n\nThe perimeter divided by $a$ is:\n$ ( 9a/2)/a = 9/2.$\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{2}.}$",
    "To find the perimeter of one of the congruent quadrilaterals, we need to consider the line $y = x/2$ cutting the square at two points and then find the lengths of the segments formed. \n\nThe line $y = x/2$ intersects the right side of the square when $y = a$, so we have \n\n$$a = \\frac{x}{2}$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get \n\n$$x = 2a.$$ \n\nThe point of intersection on the right side of the square is $(2a, a)$. \n\nSince the line $y = x/2$ also intersects the top left side of the square, we can find this point by equating $x$ and $y$ as \n\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= \\frac{x}{2} \\\\\na &= \\frac{-a}{2} \\\\\n-a &= \\frac{-a}{2} \\\\\n-2a &= -a \\\\\na &= a.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThis is not correct, so instead we want to use $x=-a$. The $y$ value can be obtained as $y = \\frac{-a}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the top-left point where the line intersects the square is $(-a, -a/2)$.\n\nWith this point, we now have two points on the line (one of them is a point on the corner of the square). They are $(-a, -a/2)$ and $(2a, a)$.\n\nWe also know the last intersection point of the sides of the triangle is found by considering where the line $y = x/2$ cuts the top side of the square. We get \n\n$$a = \\frac{x}{2} \\implies x = 2a.$$\n\nHowever, this is the same intersection point that we obtained earlier, which was at the corner of the right side of the square. Instead, we consider where the line intersects the top of the square. We can find this point by setting $x = a$ in the equation $y = x/\u200c2$. Then,\n\n$$y = \\frac{a}{2}.$$\n\nSo the intersection point at the top of the square is $(a, a/\u200c2)$. \n\nThe line $y = x/\u200c2$ cuts the left and right sides of the square in two points each. We do not need the intersection points for the other sides because the other side can be gotten with a horizontal segment. This can be found by saying that the height of the square goes from $-a$ to $a$ and is defined by the vertical separation between the two sides that would form the sides of the quadrilateral. This vertical separation is $a$.\n\nTherefore, we have the following segments to consider for our perimeter calculation:\n\n- $a$ from the left intersection point that goes to the line with equation $y=x/\u200c2$. Say this side always starts at the base and goes down to the line, since the interesection points that were found only give points for two sides of the shape.\n- $a$ distance for this side is determined by going down the height of the square, $(2a - (-a))/2 = a$, between the bottom intersection points at $x = -a$ and $(2a, a)$. We go one half of the height to find the $y$ coordinate because we only want to go one half of the distance to avoid getting the distance for two parts of the part. Our height was $2a$ so that is why we divided it by two and got  $a$. \n- A horizontal segment $a$ distance between the top and the line $y = x/2$ at the top interesection, which was $(a, a/2)$.\n- A vertical distance $a/2$ height from the bottom intersection of the left side of the square with equation $y = x/2$  between the top and the bottom intersection,  $(-a, a/2)$ and $(-a, -a/2)$ respectively.\n\nSince this line cuts the square into one shape, we need to add it all together to get the total boundary around it, but we must multiply the equation of $(2a - (-a))/2$ by one and a half to get the equation for $a$. Which is $\\frac{3}{2}a$.\n\nWe add the $y-x/2$ part (that is at the bottom) to the $x/2$ part (that is always on the line), and multiply the  $2a$ part at the bottom, which is  $(2a + a)$ by 0.5, and multiply by an additional 1.5 to get the $a$ part, which changes from $(a * 1.5)$ to $(3a/2)$. Then we add it all together, \n\n\\begin{align*}\n(2a + a) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) * 1.5 + (a * 1.5) + (a * 1.5)\n\\end{align*}\n\n$$= \\frac{2}{2}(3a/2) * (3/2) + a * (3/2) + a * (3/2)$$\n\n$$= a(3) + \\frac{3}{2}a + \\frac{3}{2}a$$ \n\n$$= 3a + \\frac{9}{2}a $$\n\n$$= (3 + \\frac{9}{2})a$$\n\n$$= (\\frac{6}{2} + \\frac{9}{2})a$$\n\n$$= \\frac{15}{2}a.$$\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{2}}.$"
