    "To find the sum of the lengths of the pyramid's eight edges, we can divide the problem into finding the sum of the four base edges and the four lateral edges.\n\n1. First, let's find the sum of the base edges: \nSince the base is a square with each side measuring 10 cm, the sum of the base edges is $10 \\times 4 = 40$ cm.\n\n2. Next, let's find the sum of the lateral edges: \nTo do this, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. We can view the triangular cross-section of the pyramid as a right triangle with one leg being half the diagonal of the base and the other leg being the height of the pyramid. We can find half the diagonal of the base using the base side length: half diagonal $= \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{200} = 5\\sqrt{2}$. \n\nNow we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of a lateral edge, considering the height of the pyramid as 12 cm: $lateral\\ edge = \\sqrt{12^2 + (5\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 100} = \\sqrt{244} \\approx 15.62$ cm.\n\nSince there are four lateral edges of the same length, the sum of the lateral edges is $4 \\times 15.62 \\approx 62.48$ cm.\n\n3. Finally, add the sum of the base edges and the sum of the lateral edges: \n$sum\\ of\\ edges = sum\\ of\\ base\\ edges + sum\\ of\\ lateral\\ edges \\approx 40 + 62.48 = 102.48$ \n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, the sum of the pyramid's eight edges is approximately $\\boxed{102}.$",
    "To find the sum of the lengths of the pyramid's eight edges, we can break it down into several steps.\n\n1. **Find the lengths of the base edges**:  The base is a square with each side measuring 10 cm. Since there are four such edges, their total length is 4*10 = 40 cm.\n\n2. **Understand the geometry of the pyramid**: The height of the pyramid is 12 cm, and its base is a square of side length 10 cm. This forms a right pyramid. We need to focus on finding the lengths of the four slant edges connecting the base to the apex.\n\n3. **Find the length of a slant edge (diagonal) of the base**: A diagonal of a square can be found using the formula $\\sqrt{2} \\times \\text{side length}$. In this case, the diagonal length is $\\sqrt{2} \\times 10$.\n\n4. **Find the length of a slant edge (hypotenuse) of the isosceles triangle**: An isosceles triangle is formed by the height of the pyramid, half the diagonal of the base, and the slant edge. This is a right triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the slant edge. The legs of this right triangle are 12 cm (height of the pyramid) and half the diagonal of the base ($\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times 10 = 5\\sqrt{2}$).\n\n5. **Calculate half the diagonal of the base (leg)**: Half of $\\sqrt{2} \\times 10$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times 10$\n\n6. **Calculate the length of the slant edge (hypotenuse) using the Pythagorean theorem**:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na^2 + b^2 & = c^2\\\\\n(5\\sqrt{2})^2 + 12^2 & = c ^ 2 \\\\\n(5\\sqrt{2})^2 & = (5\\sqrt{2}) \\times (5\\sqrt{2}) \\\\\n& = 50\\\\\n50 + 144 & = 194 \\\\\n194 & = c^2\\\\\n\\sqrt{194} & = c\\\\\nc & = \\sqrt{194} \\approx 13.928 \\text{  cm}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n7. **Multiply the length of a slant edge by 4**: Since there are four such slant edges, their total length is 4$\\times\\sqrt{194}$.\n\n8. **Find the sum of the lengths of all eight edges of the pyramid**: Add the total length of the base edges and the slant edges:\n   $$\n   \\text{sum\\_of\\_edges} = \\text{length\\_of\\_base\\_edges} + \\text{length\\_of\\_slant\\_edges} \n   $$ \n   $$ \n   \\begin{aligned}\n   \\text{sum\\_of\\_edges} &= 40 + 4 \\times \\sqrt{194}\\\\\n   &= 40 + 4 \\times 13.9283\\\\\n   &= 40 + 55.7132\\\\\n   &=95.7132\\\\\n   \\text{sum\\_of\\_edges\\_rounded} &= 96\n   \\end{aligned}\n   $$ \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{96}$",
    "To find the sum of the lengths of the pyramid's eight edges, let's break down the problem into steps.\n\nStep 1: \nWe can see that the pyramid has a square base with edges of length 10 cm each. This gives us four edges on the base with a total length of 4 * 10 = 40 cm.\n\nStep 2: \nNow, we need to find the lengths of the other four edges, which connect the base to the peak of the pyramid. To do this, we need to find the length of one of these edges, and then multiply it by 4 since all four edges are equal.\n\nStep 3: \nWe know the height of the pyramid (or the height of the slant edge) is 12 cm. This forms a right-angled triangle with the diagonal of the base.\n\nStep 4: \nTo find the length of the diagonal of the base, we can divide the base into two 45-45-90 triangles. Each leg of the base is 10 / sqrt(2) = 5 * sqrt(2) cm long.\n\nStep 5: \nTherefore, the length of the hypotenuse of each 45-45-90 triangle (which is the diagonal of the base) is 5 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 5 * 2 = 10 * sqrt(2) cm.\n\nStep 6: \nNow we have a right-angled triangle with the height of the pyramid as 12 cm and the hypotenuse of the base as 10 * sqrt(2) cm.\n\nStep 7: \nWe can apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other edge. \n\nStep 8: \nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nStep 9: \nLet's assign 12 as b and 10 * sqrt(2) as c. We need to find 'a'. So the equation becomes a^2 + 12^2 = (10 * sqrt(2))^2.\n\nStep 10: \nSimplifying this, we get a^2 + 144 = 200.\n\nStep 11: \nSubtracting 144 from both sides, we get a^2 = 56.\n\nStep 12: \nTaking the square root of both sides, we get a = sqrt(56) = 2 * sqrt(14) cm.\n\nStep 13: \nNow we have the length of one edge of the pyramid, which is approximately 7.48 cm.\n\nStep 14: \nSince there are four of these edges, the total length of all four edges is approximately 4 * 7.48 = 29.92 cm.\n\nStep 15: \nFinally, to find the sum of the lengths of all eight edges, we add the total length of the base edges (40 cm) and the total length of the other four edges (29.92 cm). The total length of the eight edges is approximately 69.92 cm.\n\nStep 16: \nRounding this to the nearest whole number gives us the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{70}$"
