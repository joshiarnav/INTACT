    "To find the volume of a right rectangular prism, we need to know its length, width, and height. \n\nLet's denote these dimensions as l (length), w (width), and h (height).\n\nWe know that the areas of the side, front, and bottom faces are:\n- Side face: lw = 15\n- Front face: lh = 10\n- Bottom face: wh = 6\n\nFrom the last equation (wh = 6), we can express the width (w) in terms of height (h):\nw = 6 / h\n\nNow, substitute the expression for w (6/h) into the first equation (lw = 15):\nl * (6 / h) = 15\nl * 6 = 15h\n2l = 5h\n\nNow, substitute the expression for l (2.5h) into the second equation (lh = 10):\n(2.5h) * h = 10\n2.5h^2 = 10\nh^2 = 4\nh = 2\n\nNow that we have found the height (h = 2), we can find the length and width. Substituting the value of h into the equation 2l = 5h, we get:\n2l = 10\nl = 5\n\nNext, substitute the value of h (2) into the equation w = 6 / h, we get:\nw = 6 / 2\nw = 3\n\nNow that we have the values of length (l = 5), width (w = 3), and height (h = 2), we can find the volume of the prism:\nVolume = l * w * h\n= 5 * 3 * 2\n= 30\n\nSo, the volume of the right rectangular prism is $\\boxed{30}$.",

    "To find the volume of the right rectangular prism, we need to find the length, width, and height of the prism. \n\nLet's say the length of the prism is L, the width is W, and the height is H.\n\nWe are given that the area of the side face is 15 square inches, so we can write an equation: \nL \u00d7 H = 15\n\nWe are also given that the area of the front face is 10 square inches, so we can write another equation: \nL \u00d7 W = 10\n\nThe area of the bottom face is 6 square inches, so we can write another equation: \nW \u00d7 H = 6\n\nNow, let's find a way to eliminate two variables and find the remaining one. We can start by multiplying the first two equations (L \u00d7 H = 15 and L \u00d7 W = 10). This will give us:\n\nL\u00b2 \u00d7 H \u00d7 W = 15 \u00d7 10\n\nSince L\u00b2 \u00d7 H \u00d7 W can be written as (L \u00d7 W) \u00d7 (L \u00d7 H), we can substitute (L \u00d7 W) = 10 and (L \u00d7 H) = 15 into the equation:\n\n(L \u00d7 W) \u00d7 (L \u00d7 H) = 150\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6 (from W \u00d7 H = 6) to get:\n\n(L \u00d7 H) = 25\n\nSince we already know (L \u00d7 H) = 15, but the result is 25 doesn't make sense for this calculation given that 15 square is less than 25 so the instant the multiply with 10 again and the sense will be 150 which results 25 from having 6 as common, results having 25 but common value in both equations don\u2019t results as 25 only gives error in solution having initial 150 which results to just one value after after being divided from bottom multiplication and then results this manually and as follow follow it as L \u00d7 H = 15, but  actually in definition of solution can L \u00d7 W = 10, divide by 6, our equation becomes L \u00d7 H will = 150/6.\n\n\nNow L \u00d7 W = 10, and to find W and H, we need to find L first. Since W \u00d7 H = 6, we can divide both sides of the equation by 15 (to find the value of W). The equation becomes W = 6/15 or (6/15)*H.\n\n\nL \u00d7 (6/15)H = 10, multiply both sides by 15/L we will get 6H = 150/L\n\n\nNow to find the value of H after being found we multiply it  to this equation and now H is 15/6 this gives only the two value in both sides the definition which can L is 10 in the multiplication as well our H value is represented in H = 25/L.\nGiven these two equation we multiply these to get this 6*(15/L)*H results to to equation  6*25/L  which became 150/L\nNow we multiply both sides by L (this won\u2019t change the result, just to get rid of the fraction) so it is 150 equals to 6*25 we have 6 results 150 as being 25 *6 we have L is our product in multiplication of both equation this manually and now multiply both equation results to 150 but common value in both equations don\u2019t results as 25 only gives error in solution will having initial 150 which results to just one value after being divided from bottom multiplication after after being found we multiply it to this H results this equation H is 150/6 we do division this gives us only the two value in both sides definition in which can L is 10 in the  multiplication as well our H value is H 25/L and we add these both value.\n\n\nNow we have equation, L \u00d7 H = 15 and L \u00d7 25/L = 150/L to live equation remember to see on know was cancel with 25 and only one equation left which is L = 10 to do length our now multiply the both the equation  we multiply results now has multiplication value of both value we get L = 10 our product multiplication of both and both value this manually and now as follow it we have found length our solve was our problem view later has multiplication this do now, H value is 15/L but since L is now 10, so H = 15/10  which  = H = 1.5\n\n\nNow we have length and height, we can use them to find the volume. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is V = L \u00d7 W \u00d7 H.\n\nWe know that L \u00d7 W = 10, and L = 10, so W = 1. Now that we have all three dimensions, we can find the volume:\n\nV = L \u00d7 W \u00d7 H\nV = 10 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1.5\nV = 15\n\nThe answer is  $\\boxed{15}$"

  "solution": "Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$.
