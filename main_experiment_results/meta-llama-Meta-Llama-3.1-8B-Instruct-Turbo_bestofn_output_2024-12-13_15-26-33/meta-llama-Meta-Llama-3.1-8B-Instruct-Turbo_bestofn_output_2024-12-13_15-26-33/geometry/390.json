    "We denote $x$ to be the measure of angle DBC and $y$ to be the measure of angle ECB. From the problem given, we know that the measure of angle ECB is equal to 3/7 times the measure of angle DBC, so $y=\\frac{3}{7}x$. We are given that the value of angle A is 60 degrees, therefore the sum of angles DBC and ECB is 30 degrees.\n\nNow we can solve the equation x + y = 30 to find the value of x and y. We substitute $y=3x/7$ in the equation x + $3x/7$ = 30, which gives us $10x/7 = 30$. Solving for $x$, we have $x = 21$. Then we can find the value of y using $y=3x/7$, which gives us $y=9$.\n\nCreating a triangle with the three points A, B and C and using the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle ACD, we have AC squared is equal to 12 squared + (12tan 9) squared.\n\nFurther simplifying the equation, AC squared is equal to 144 + (144tan^2 9).\n\nAC squared is equal to 144 + 144 \\* ( \\frac{3 \\sqrt{4}-3}{3+\\sqrt{4}})^2 \\*  ( \\frac{3+\\sqrt{4} }{12} )^2\n\nAfter simplifying the equation, AC squared is equal to 144  +  588 / 5 + 576\\sqrt{4} / 5.\n\nAC squared is equal to  ( 5 \\* 0.72 + 12 \\* 4 + 5 \\* \\sqrt{4} + 12 \\* \\sqrt{4}) / \\sqrt{4}\n\nWe can use the same method to simplify AC squared to 144 + 12  * sqrt(4) * ( 5 \\sqrt{4} + 12)  / \\sqrt{4}\n\nAC squared is equal to  12  * sqrt(4) *  (5\\sqrt{4} + 12) + 144\n\nThen we can divide both sides by 12 \\* sqrt(4), and keep both sides squared to simplify it. \n\n   AC is equal to 4 (5\\sqrt{4} + 12) + \\sqrt{4}\n\nIn triangle ACD, We can simplify the expression of CE using the equation:  AC = AD / sin A, so AD = AC * sin A.\n\nSimplifying the expression,  sin A = \\sqrt{3} / 2, AD = AC * \\sqrt{3} / 2.\n\n We can simplify the expression of CE to: CE = ( (12) * (12) * sin 9 + 12 * sin A) / (2 * sin 9 * sin A).\n\nSimplifying the expression, CE = (36 * sin 9 +  12 * \\sqrt(3) / 2) / (\\frac{\\sqrt(3)}{2} * \\frac{3}{2})\n\nSimplifying the expression, CE = 12 * ( 2 * sin 9 + \\sqrt(3) ) / \\sqrt(3).\n\nSimplifying the expression, CE = 12 * (9 sin 9 + \\sqrt(3)) / \\sqrt (3) \n\nNow square CE to find it in the boxed answer format.\n\n  Therefore: CE = a(\u221ab + \u221ac)\n\nwhere a = 12\n\nwhere b = 3\n\nwhere c = 84\n\nTherefore: a = 12\n\nb = 3\n\nc = 84\n\na + b + c is equal to 99 \n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{99}$",

    "Step 1: To begin with, we need to determine the measure of $\\angle ECB$ based on the given relationship that $m \\angle DBC = 3m \\angle ECB$. Let's assume $m \\angle ECB = x$. Then, $m \\angle DBC = 3x$. \n\nStep 2: As $\\overline{BD}$ and $\\overline{CE}$ are perpendicular to $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{AB}$ respectively, triangles $\\triangle ABD$ and $\\triangle CBE$ are right triangles. In triangle $\\triangle CBE$, $\\angle BCE$ and $\\angle CBE$ are complementary, and their sum is $90^\\circ$. Since $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot m \\angle ABC + m \\angle BCE = 90^\\circ$, we find that $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 60^\\circ + m \\angle BCE = 90^\\circ$. This simplifies to $30^\\circ + m \\angle BCE = 90^\\circ$, which implies $m \\angle BCE = 60^\\circ$.\n\nStep 3: Since $m \\angle ABC = m \\angle AEC + m \\angle ECA = m \\angle BCE + m \\angle ECB = 60^\\circ + x$, it follows that $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot m \\angle ABC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (60^\\circ + x)$. Since we want to find $x$, we have $15^\\circ + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot x = 30^\\circ$.\n\nStep 4: Solving the equation $15^\\circ + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot x = 30^\\circ$, we find $x = 60^\\circ$.\n\nStep 5: Since $m \\angle ECB = m \\angle AEC$, it follows that triangles $\\triangle AEB$ and $\\triangle CED$ are similar. Since the corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional, it follows that $\\frac{EC}{AB} = \\frac{DE}{AE}$ and $\\frac{EC}{AB} = \\frac{CD}{CA}$.\n\nStep 6: Solving for the ratios, we find that $\\frac{12-EC}{12} = \\frac{BC}{AC}$ and $\\frac{12-EC}{12} = \\frac{12}{12+EC}$. Equating the right sides, we get $\\frac{BC}{AC} = \\frac{12}{12+EC}$. Substitute the value of $BC = \\sqrt{\\frac{12 \\cdot (12+EC)^2}{9}}$, and $AC = \\sqrt{12 \\cdot \\frac{12^2 + EC^2}{9}}$ in the above expression.\n\nStep 7: Simplifying, we have $\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{12 \\cdot (12+EC)^2}{9}}}{\\sqrt{12 \\cdot \\frac{12^2 + EC^2}{9}}} = \\frac{12}{12+EC}$. This simplifies to $\\frac{\\sqrt{12(12+EC)^2}}{\\sqrt{12(12^2 + EC^2)}} = \\frac{12}{12+EC}$.\n\nStep 8: Squaring both sides of the above equation, we have $\\frac{12(12+EC)^2}{12(12^2 + EC^2)} = \\frac{144}{(12+EC)^2}$.\n\nStep 9: Cross-multiplying, we have $12(12+EC)^2 = 144 \\cdot 12(12^2 + EC^2)$.\n\nStep 10: Canceling $12$ from both sides and expanding the squared binomial, we have $(12+EC)^2 = 144(12^2 + EC^2)$.\n\nStep 11: Expanding the left-hand side, we have $12^2 + 2 \\cdot 12 \\cdot EC + EC^2 = 144 \\cdot 12^2 + 144 \\cdot EC^2$.\n\nStep 12: Equating the corresponding coefficients of similar terms on both sides, we have $12^2 + EC^2 = (144+1) \\cdot 12^2$ and $2 \\cdot 12 \\cdot EC = 144 \\cdot EC^2$.\n\nStep 13: Simplifying, we have $12^2 + EC^2 = 145 \\cdot 12^2$ and $2 \\cdot 12 \\cdot EC = 144 \\cdot EC^2$.\n\nStep 14: Subtracting $12^2$ from both sides of the equation $12^2 + EC^2 = 145 \\cdot 12^2$, we have $EC^2 = 145 \\cdot 12^2 - 12^2 = 144 \\cdot 12^2$.\n\nStep 15: Taking the square root of both sides of the above equation, we have $EC = \\sqrt{144 \\cdot 12^2}$.\n\nStep 16: Evaluating $EC^2 = 144 \\cdot 12^2$, we have $EC^2 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 4^2$.\n\nStep 17: Taking the square root of both sides, we have $EC = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nStep 18: Evaluating $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}$, we have $EC = 48 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nStep 19: Given the expression $48\\sqrt{2} + 48 \\cdot \\sqrt{3}$ represents the length of segment $EC$, we have that the length of segment $EC$ is $48(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3})$. As the expression is in the form $a(\\sqrt{b}+\\sqrt{c})$, where $a = 48$, $b = 2$, and $c = 3$, the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $a + b + c = 48 + 2 + 3 = 53$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{53}$"
