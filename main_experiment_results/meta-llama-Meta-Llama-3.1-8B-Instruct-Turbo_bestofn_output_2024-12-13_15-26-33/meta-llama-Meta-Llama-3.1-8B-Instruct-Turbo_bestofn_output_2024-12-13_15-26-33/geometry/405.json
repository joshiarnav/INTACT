    "To find the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$, we need to consider the properties of the triangle and the given conditions.\n\nGiven:\n- Perimeter of triangle $ABC = 2007$ units.\n- The sides $AB$, $BC$, and $AC$ have integer lengths with the condition that $AB< BC \\leq AC$.\n\nStep 1: Since $AB < BC \\leq AC$, the smallest possible value for $BC - AB$ occurs when $AB$ and $BC$ are as close as possible to each other.\n\nStep 2: As the perimeter of the triangle is 2007, we should look for a combination of side lengths that satisfies this condition, keeping in mind that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side (triangle inequality).\n\nStep 3: We can express the perimeter of the triangle as: $AB + BC + AC = 2007$.\n\nStep 4: Applying the triangle inequality, we have: $AB + BC > AC$, $AB + AC > BC$, and $BC + AC > AB$.\n\nStep 5: Considering the given inequalities and integer side lengths, the minimum possible value of $AB$ and $BC$ will be 668 and 669 respectively. This will ensure that that $AB + BC > AC$ is true, as long as $AC$ is the longest side.\n\nStep 6: We can test the possible values of $AB$ and $BC$ by plugging them into the equation from Step 3 and checking for valid values of $AC$ that satisfy the triangle inequality.\n\nStep 7: If we select $AB = 668$ and $BC = 669$, the equation becomes: $668 + 669 + AC = 2007$, which yields $AC = 670$.\n\nStep 8: Substituting the valid values for $AB$, $BC$, and $AC$ into the differences equation yields $BC - AB = 669 - 668 = 1$.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$ is 1.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "To find the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$, we need to consider the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for any triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, the following inequalities must hold:\n\n1. $a + b > c$\n2. $a + c > b$\n3. $b + c > a$\n\nGiven that the perimeter of the triangle is 2007 units, we can express the lengths of the sides as $x$, $x + k$, and $2007 - 2x - k$, where $x$ is the length of side $AB$, $x + k$ is the length of side $BC$, and $2007 - 2x - k$ is the length of side $AC$. Since $AB < BC \\leq AC$, we know that $x < x + k \\leq 2007 - 2x - k$.\n\nWe can simplify the inequalities as follows:\n\n1. $x + (x + k) > 2007 - 2x - k \\Rightarrow 2x + k > 2007 - 2x - k \\Rightarrow 4x > 2006 - 2k$\n2. $x + (2007 - 2x - k) > x + k \\Rightarrow 2007 - 2x - k > x + k \\Rightarrow 2007 - 3x > k$\n3. $(x + k) + (2007 - 2x - k) > x \\Rightarrow 2007 - x > x$\n\nNow we consider (3), which yields $2x < 2007$, so we can set an upper bound for x: $x < \\frac{2007}{2}$.\n\nTo find the smallest $k$ that satisfies the inequalities, we must satisfy the second inequality (simplified from 2): $2007 - 3x > k$. To ensure that $k$ approaches its smallest value and satisfies the first inequality (simplified from 1), $4x > 2006 - 2k$; this can be rewritten as $2x > 1003 - k$. Thus by setting $k=1002$ and $x=501$, we can obtain a valid (and small) result. However, we should verify that this setup follows the constraints that $0 < k$ and $0 < x < x+k$, which this does.\n\nTo check the third inequality $2x < 2007$:\n$\\quad$ Since it's already given, we know that our boundary has not been violated, whereas $\\quad k=1002$ does cause our first condition to be violated.
