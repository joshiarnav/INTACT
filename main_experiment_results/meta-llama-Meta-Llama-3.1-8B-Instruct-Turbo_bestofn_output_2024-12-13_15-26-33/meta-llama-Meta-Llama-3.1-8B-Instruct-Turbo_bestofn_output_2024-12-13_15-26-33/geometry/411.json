    "To solve the problem, let's follow the steps below:\n\n1.  We are given right triangle $AGD$ with a square inscribed in it, denoted as $BCFE$. This means the square's corners will touch the triangle. We can see that $BCFE$ is a square since all four sides are equal.\n2.  Looking at the diagram, we see that $\\angle CDF = \\angle AEB$ and $\\angle BAE = \\angle CFD$. This is because vertically opposite angles are equal, so $\\angle AEB = \\angle CDF$ and $\\angle BAE = \\angle CFD$. Since related angles are equal, this means $\\triangle AEB \\sim \\triangle FDC$.\n3.  We know the side lengths $AB = 28$ units and $CD = 58$ units. Now that we've related the triangles, we can use their side length ratio to find the side length of the square.\n4.  Let $x$ be the side length of the square. Since $\\triangle AEB \\sim \\triangle FDC$, we have the following ratio of side lengths: $\\frac{x}{58} = \\frac{28}{x}$. \n5.  Now we can solve for $x$ by solving the equation: $x^2 = 28 \\cdot 58$. This gives us $x^2 = 1624$, so $x = \\sqrt{1624}$.\n6.  The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. Therefore, the area of $BCFE$ is $x^2 = \\boxed{1624}$ square units.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{1624}$.",
    "To find the area of the square $BCFE$, we can use the properties of similar triangles and the given side lengths of the triangle and the square.\n\nStep 1:  Since $\\triangle ABG \\sim \\triangle FDC$, we can use the similarity ratio to find the length of a side of the square.\nStep 2:  We know that $\\frac{AB}{x} = \\frac{x}{CD}$, where $x$ is the side length of the square.\nStep 3:  Rearranging the equation, we get $x^2 = AB \\cdot CD$.\nStep 4:  Substituting the given values, we have $x^2 = 28 \\cdot 58 = 1624$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the area of square $BCFE$ is $x^2$, which is $\\boxed{1624}$.\n\nSo, the area of the square is 1624 square units.",
    "Step 1:  The problem involves a right triangle $AGD$ with a square $BCFE$ inscribed in it. To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of similar triangles and the relationships between their side lengths.\nStep 2:  We'll begin by noting that the points $B, C, F, E, A,$ and $G$ form different parts of the right triangle $AGD$.
