    "To solve this problem, we'll start by considering the properties of the given equilateral triangle and the perpendiculars from point P. \n\nSince $\\triangle ABC$ is equilateral, all sides have the same length, which we'll denote as 's'. \n\nGiven that $PQ=1$, $PR=2$, and $PS=3$, we know that the total height of the triangle is the sum of these three lengths. Because of the equilateral nature, the height of the triangle when drawn to each side from a common point is the same. Therefore, the total height is $h = PQ + PR + PS = 6$.\n\nFor any equilateral triangle, the height can also be determined by the formula $h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} * s$, where 's' is the length of any side of the triangle.\n\nSo we set the two expressions for 'h' equal to each other to find 's'. We have: \n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} * s = 6$.\n\nSolving for 's', we get:\n\n$s = \\frac{6 * 2}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}}$. \n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\\sqrt{3}$. This gives:\n\n$s = \\frac{12\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\n\nTherefore, the length of the sides of the equilateral triangle $\\triangle ABC$ is $4\\sqrt{3}$.",
    "To begin, let $s = AB = BC = CA$.
