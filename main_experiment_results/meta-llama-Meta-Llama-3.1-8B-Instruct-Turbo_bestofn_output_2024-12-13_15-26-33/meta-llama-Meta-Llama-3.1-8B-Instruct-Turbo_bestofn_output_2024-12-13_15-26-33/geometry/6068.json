    "To solve this problem, let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Visualizing the cube and the light path**:  We are dealing with a cube, which means all sides are equal (12 units in this case). Let's break it down visually. We have a beam of light coming out of one vertex of the cube (A), and it reflects off the adjacent face (BCFG). We need to find the path of this beam when it reflects off the faces of the cube until it reaches another vertex.\n\n2. **Solving for the point of reflection P**: We know that point P is 7 units from $\\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\\overline{BC}$. This forms a right-angled triangle with sides of lengths 5 and 7. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can calculate the distance from P to the point directly above A on face BCDG (let's call it point X). For face BCFG, point P forms a right triangle with sides of length 5 and 7, so the hypotenuse is the distance from P to point X on the adjacent face (BCDG), i.e., $\\sqrt{5^2+7^2}= \\sqrt{74}$ units.\n\n3. **Determining the path of the light beam**: Once the beam of light hits face BCFG at point P, it will reflect off the adjacent face of the cube. Because the beam continues to be reflected off the faces of the cube, the light path is essentially a path of segments that form a right triangle with the final segment being a diagonal of the cube (from the point where the light exits face BCFG to the opposite vertex of the cube). This can also be thought of as a 3D right triangle with legs of length 5 and 7 units.\n\n   This gives us a light travel distance of $5\\sqrt{2}+7\\sqrt{2}+12\\sqrt{2}$, then in the final diagonal the light hits a vertex. We therefore need to only include the diagonal distance. This gives us: \n   $5\\sqrt{2}+7\\sqrt{2}+12\\sqrt{2}=24\\sqrt{2}$\n\n   Now we can find $m+n$.\n\n4. **Finding m + n**: Given that the length of the light path until it next reaches a vertex of the cube is $24\\sqrt{2}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers, we can see that $m = 24$ and $n = 2$. Hence, the sum of $m + n = 24 + 2 = \\boxed{26}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{26}$",
    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the path of the light beam as it reflects off the faces of the cube.\n\nThe path starts at vertex $A$, then it reflects off face $BCFG$. \n\nSince the coordinates of the cube are considered to be integers and rotations/reflections, we need to define $A$ as the origin, $(0,0,0)$. Also, since the light must reflect off $BCFG$ at the given point $P$, and the side length is given as $AB=12$ which is a face diagonal of $BCFG$, Point $P$ can be positioned in a $3$x$3$ grid given by the $BCFG$ coordinates. Point $P$ is said to be at $(7,5,z).$ Now, $P$ must lie on the plane shown in the diagram that represents the far face from $A$. But in a cube, the planes are the diagonals of the faces. So, what's the equation of the diagonal of the given face?\n\nWe now need to determine the $z$ value of point $P$. To find this, we consider the face diagonal of the given plane $BCFG$. A face diagonal of a face is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of a side. We have the equation for this since the length of a side is 12 and a face diagonal of face $BCFG$ would be $\\sqrt{2}\\cdot12 = 12\\sqrt{2}$ units. So the $z$ value for vertex $C$ must be $5\\sqrt{2}$ and for point $P$ it is then $(5\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{2}) = 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSince point $P$ reflects off $BCFG$, vertex $A$ highlights the $x$-axis. It will then be reflected to the $y$-axis at point $Q$, since the light has to be $\\sqrt{2}$ times the distance to any vertex of a face of the cube since any vertex of a given plane would be the intersection of a perpendicular to the plane and the cube itself. This creates a $45-45-90$ triangle and that gives point $Q$ a position of (5,7,12) $\\sqrt{2}$ units away from point $P$.\n\nPoint $Q$ now reflects off face $CDAB$. It will go to point $R$, which will be 7 units from the $y$-axis, and 5 units from the $z$-axis, and then must be a point in a 3x3 grid. Now, the distance $\\overline{PQ}$ was found to be $\\sqrt{(5-7)^2 + (7-5)^2 + (12-4\\sqrt{2})^2} = 7\\sqrt{2+ 47} = 7\\sqrt{49} = 7 \\cdot 7.$ And the distance $\\overline{QR}$ is the hypotenuse of the triangle with legs 7 and 5. So the distance $\\overline{QR}$ is\n\\[\\sqrt{7^2 + 5^2} = \\sqrt{49 + 25} = \\sqrt{74}.\\]\nSince $PQ$ equals $QR$, then $PQ$ also equals $\\sqrt{74}$, in which the time it takes for the light beam to travel from $P$ to $Q$ is $\\sqrt{74}$ units. We also should have found $x$, $y$ units of point $R$ since point $R$ is on the plane, the equation is $(y-5)^2 + (x-7)^2 + z^2 = 74$ where all the coordinates must be integers. We can then take the square root of the corner values in order to obtain: $y - 5 = (3, 5, \\text{or\\ 7})$; $x - 7 = (4, 2, \\text{or\\-2})$ with $z$ giving integer solutions to satisfying any of these pairs of integers. This gives 3 possible pairs for (x, y): $(11, 8)$, $(3, 12)$ or $(5, 10)$ (since only the pair $(4,3)$\\  $y=-5$ for those of you who like listing squares). Since one side length is now 7 units, it then can be considered that point $R$ will fall at any of the three shown vertices. \n\nThe distance from the vertex at $(3, 12)$ to point $R$ (6, 7, 0) is \\[\\sqrt{(7 - 12)^2 + (7 - 6)^2 + 0^2} = 5\\sqrt{2}.\\]\n\nThe distance from the vertex at $(5, 10)$ to point $Q$ $(7,5,12)$ is \\[\\sqrt{(7 - 5)^2 + (5 - 10)^2 + 12^2} = 15\\sqrt{2}.\\]\n\nThe distance from the vertex at $(11, 8)$ to point $R$ (6,7,0) is \\[\\sqrt{(6 - 11)^2 + (7 - 8)^2 + 0^2} = 5\\sqrt{2}.\\]\n\nAll three pairs yield the same value of distance, which is $5\\sqrt{2}$ units.  Therefore, we have found that the value $m = 5.$ We can then solve for the value of $n$.\n\nSince $n = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 49$ and is not divisible by the square of any prime other than 2, we have $n = 98.$ Therefore, the final answer is $m + n = 5 + 98 = \\boxed{103}.$",
    "To find the length of the light path, we can visualize the path in 3D space. \n\nThe light beam starts at point $A$ and travels to point $P$. To get to point $P$, the light beam has to travel 5 units along one face and 7 units along a perpendicular face. Thus, the distance from $A$ to $P$ is the diagonal of a 5 by 7 rectangle, which can be calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem:\n \n$$\nAP = \\sqrt{5^2+7^2}=\\sqrt{74}\n$$\n\nNow that the light is at point $P$, it makes a sequence of reflections. The next step is to determine the series of reflections that occur as the light travels back to a vertex of the cube.\n\nUpon reflection with the adjacent face $EFCD$ (or face $ABCD$, respectively), the initial segment of the light having traveled along the face adjacent to $P$ is essentially starting a second diagonal that essentially halves the remaining path distance traveled by the light. \n\nFollowing the action above, it thus becomes clear that we essentially have two reflective paths that cut up the light path, proportional to the square root of the numbers, in essence their square roots scale down, but the collective totals involve that of a sum of the square root values, i.e  just involving  $\\sqrt{74}$ as initial and subsequent reflective total distances continue intermediated by reflection median dimensions and collecting up collectively to that of square root 74 total distances along with comparisons more like just involving the initial number that initiated such collecting total action.\n\nWhen it reflects in a $45^\\circ$ angle as from perspective $AC$, the reflection of a proportional scaled distance is:\n \n$$\nBCO=\\sqrt{(12^2)+12^2} = 12\\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nWhen the next segment reflects in the plane $AOB$ to hit the median point E $(\\frac{12 \\sqrt 2}{2} in x, \\frac{12 \\sqrt 2}{2} in y)$ in relation to each side of that with unlimited information on calculations corresponding e.g to the  length removal, totaling distances going into such expressions shows $\\sqrt{74}$ as minimally direct representation for such distances formula form which yet stays at a united path, already recognized mathematical or measurable continuous directions correctly obtained earlier to it as such corresponding types of shows involved glocal translations having respectively formation topology formally sourced here of decisions in profitable information deriving properties fully equipped according to the design goals in need.\n\nUpon reflection in the plane $AOC$ at a $45^\\circ$ angle, the total length of the path from $A$ until the light reaches the vertex of the cube is the sum of \\( AP \\), OQ, and QC.\n\nWe have calculated $AP = \\sqrt{74}$\nFor $OQ$, the distances between the vertices of the cube are the same as the length \\(AB \\).\nUpon reflection in the plane $AOC$, the light has traveled in \\(45^\\circ\\) angle from O to Q.\nTherefore $OQ$ can be calculated in this way:\n \n$$\nOQ= \\frac{\\sqrt{74}}{2}\n$$\n\nWhen in AC the reflective distance will then be noted by the collective comparisons sum of distances from $AP$ involving corresponding $\\sqrt{74}$ and subsequent OC under total expression when found intermediated by collecting $A$Q fractions.\n \n$$\nQC= \\sqrt{74} - \\frac{\\sqrt{74}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{74}}{2}\n$$\n\nSo, the total length is:\n$$\nAQ = AP + OQ +QC\n$$\n$$\nAQ = \\sqrt{74} + \\frac{\\sqrt{74}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{74}}{2}$$\n$$\nAQ = 2\\sqrt{74}\n$$\n\nAnd therefore the final answer is:\n\n$$\nm=2, n= 74\n$$\nand\n$$\nm+n = 76\n$$\n\n$\\boxed{76}$"

  "solution": "When a light beam reflects off a surface, the path is like that of a ball bouncing. Picture that, and also imagine X, Y, and Z coordinates for the cube vertices. The coordinates will all involve 0's and 12's only, so that means that the X, Y, and Z distance traveled by the light must all be divisible by 12. Since the light's Y changes by 5 and the X changes by 7 (the Z changes by 12, don't worry about that), and 5 and 7 are relatively prime to 12, the light must make 12 reflections onto the XY plane or the face parallel to the XY plane.\nIn each reflection, the distance traveled by the light is $\\sqrt{ (12^2) + (5^2) + (7^2) }$ = $\\sqrt{218}$. This happens 12 times, so the total distance is $12\\sqrt{218}$. $m=12$ and $n=218$, so therefore, the answer is $m+n=\\boxed{230}$.",
