    "Step 1:  To start, we are given eight circles packed in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane, and we need to find the equation of a line that divides the union of these circular regions into two equal areas.\nStep 2:  We can start by observing the symmetry of the packing. The line $l$ that divides the region $\\mathcal{R}$ into two equal areas must pass through the tangency points of the circles.\nStep 3:  The middle circle is circumscribed about a 1x1 square, which means it touches all four sides of the square. Therefore, the line $l$ must pass through the midpoints of the bottom side of the middle circle and the point $\\left(1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, which is the tangency of the bottom circle and the one to its right.\n\nStep 4:  We can now use the two-point form to find the equation of the line. Given two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the equation of the line passing through these points can be found using the formula $y - y_1 = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)$.\n\nStep 5:  Using this formula, we can substitute the given points, $\\left(1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\frac{3}{2},2\\right)$, to find the equation of the line $l$. This will give us the equation in the form $ax = by + c$.\n\nStep 6:  The equation of the line can be simplified to $6x = 2y + 5$, which is in the required form. Here, $a=6$, $b=2$, and $c=5$.\n\nStep 7:  Finally, we can calculate $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 6^2 + 2^2 + 5^2 = 36 + 4 + 25 = \\boxed{65}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{65}$",
    "To divide the region into two areas of equal area, the line must pass through the tangency point of the bottom left circle and the one to its right. Additionally, it must pass through the tangency of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it. This provides us with two points, and since the slope of the line is 3, we can determine the equation of the line as follows. \n\nFirst, let's name the points in the Cartesian coordinate system. The point for the bottom left circle and the one beneath it are both $(1,1)$ and $(1+2, 1+2)$ or $(3,3)$ respectively. The point for the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it are $(1+2, 5)$ or $(3,5)$. \n\nConsidering the given points and the slope of the line, we can calculate the slope-intercept form of the line, $y = mx + b$, as follows:\n\n- Using point $(1,1)$ and slope $m = 3$, we have $1 = 3 * 1 + b$, so we get $b = -2$.\n\nHowever, given point $(3,5)$ and the slope, we get:\n\n- $5 = 3 * 3 + b$, and $b$ does not equal $-2$.\n\nHowever, by re-examining the line in general form, we have $bx - ay = c$.\n\n\n\nHowever, by choosing point $(3,3)$ and given slope, we get:\n\n- Using our line equation format, $bx - ay = c$, with $(a, b) = (1, -3)$ and the point $(3,3)$, we have:\n\n$-3 * 3 + 1 * 3 = c$\n\n$c = -6$\n\nThen plugging our new value of $(a, b)$ and the point $(1,5)$, we get:\n\n$-3 * 3 + 1 * 5 = c$\n\n$c = -4$\n\n\nAs the given equation format is $ax = by + c$, we need to re-arrange it so the coefficients and constants line up:\n\n$(a, b) = (1, -3)$\n\n$c = 6$\n\n\nAnd now plugging these into the required style:\n\nOur final answer is: $\\boxed{1 + 9 + 36}$",
    "To find the line $l$ that divides the given set of circles into two regions of equal area, we need to analyze their geometrical properties first.\n\nStep 1: We observe that the points $(1,3)$, $(3,1)$, $\\left(1+\\frac{p}{2},1+\\frac{q}{2}\\right)$, $\\left\\{\\left(1+3p,1+3q\\right)\\,\\middle|\\,p,q\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}\\right\\}$ are provided by the rationale.\n\nStep 2: We calculate the center and distance of point $(1,3)$ and we get to be the center of the smallest circle. So is for points $(3,1)$.\n\nStep 3: We calculate the center and distance of point $\\left(1+\\frac{p}{2},1+\\frac{q}{2}\\right)$, we get to be the center of other circles.\n\nStep 4: Next, we assume that line $l$ is given by the equation $y = mx + c$, to be a line with slope 3.\n\nStep 5: Then we get the equation of the line $l$ with slope 3 which intersects point $(1,1)$. It is $y = 3x -2$. Also, this is useful to find distance from the origin to $l$ which equals 5, and the area of any of the circles that are not directly on $l$ and under another circle that is below $l$. \n\nStep 6:  Next, by considering the areas of the circles, the packing density of circles, and their strengths in region $\\mathcal{R}$ \u2014 to ensure the regions are of equal area on both sides, we need to use rational to decide the amount of some parts should take the size of positive integer ($x$).\n\nStep 7: Given the above in mind, we find the total area of eight circles equal to $8\\cdot\\frac{1^2\\pi}{4}=2\\pi$, and with circle centers in the first quadrant to be equidistant, the circle beneath point $(2,4)$ should have a  $\\frac{1}{2}$ size in region $\\mathcal{R}$.\n\nStep 8: Consider that we have to use a line that leaves an equal amount of area of circles to the left and the right of it on the plane. We find that to do this, the line must equal $l$.\n\nStep 9: Also to get $l$ which has slope 3,  and with point $(1,1)$, we use equation of the line $l$ with slope 3. \n\nSo the equation of a line with a slope of 3 through point (1,1) is\n$y=\\frac{y_1}{x_1}\\left(x-x_1\\right)+y_1$ is $y = \\frac{y_1}{x_1}\\left(x-x_1\\right)+y_1$ and to be a line with slope 3 and passing through point (1,1), we get the equation of $y = 3x-2$.\n\nStep 10: Get line equation of the problem using $y=3x-2$ in the context where the problem is to be answered the $y=\\frac11(ax=by+c)$ where $a,b,$ and $c$ are positive integers whose greatest common divisor is 1, we get .\n\n\nUsing $y=3x-2$ to be equal to the equation of  $y = \\frac11 (ax=by+c)$ where $a,b,$ and $c$ are positive integers whose greatest common divisor is 1, we get\n\n\n$ax=by+c \\Leftrightarrow x=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(8y+4\\right)$.\n\\\\(-4x-8y-4 = 0$.\n\n\n\nStep 11: We know that \\boxed{a^2+b^2+c^2=4^2+8^2+4^2}  and with $(a,b,c)=(4,8,4)$ we have\n\\begin{align*}\na^2+b^2+c^2&=(4)^2+(8)^2+(4)^2=16+64+16\\\\&=96\\\\&=\\boxed{96}. \n\\end {align*}\n\\\\ \\\\\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{96}$"
