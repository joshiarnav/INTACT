  "problem": "A right circular cone has base radius $r$ and height $h$. The cone lies on its side on a flat table. As the cone rolls on the surface of the table without slipping, the point where the cone's base meets the table traces a circular arc centered at the point where the vertex touches the table. The cone first returns to its original position on the table after making $17$ complete rotations. The value of $h/r$ can be written in the form $m\\sqrt {n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n$.\n",

    "To solve this problem, we need to relate the circumference of the circle that the cone rolls on (which is determined by the circumference of the cone's base and its height) with the distance the cone travels and its rotations.\n\nStep 1: \nThe circumference of the circular path can be calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem. This is derived from the fact that the radius of the circular path is the slant height of the cone, given by $\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$, which is the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle formed by the height and radius.\n\nStep 2: \nThe circumference of the circular path that the cone rolls on is $2\\pi\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$. This is equivalent to the distance the cone travels in one complete rotation.\n\nStep 3: \nSince the cone travels the circumference of this circular path 17 times and also rotates 17 times, the total distance traveled must be 17 times the circumference of the circular path. Therefore, the total distance traveled is $17 \\times 2\\pi\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$.\n\nStep 4: \nHowever, the total distance traveled by the cone is also equal to 17 times the circumference of its base (since it rotates 17 times). The circumference of the cone's base is $2\\pi r$. Therefore, the total distance traveled can be expressed as $17 \\times 2\\pi r$.\n\nStep 5: \nSince these two distances are equal, we can equate them to get the equation: $17 \\times 2\\pi\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2} = 17 \\times 2\\pi r$. We can now cancel out the common terms to obtain: $\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2} = r$.\n\nStep 6: \nSquaring both sides, we get: $r^2 + h^2 = r^2$.\n\nStep 7: \nRearranging the equation, we get: $h^2 = 0$.\n\nStep 8: \nHowever, the above equation can be an issue since we are trying to find the ratio of h to r, and the above gives up that answer with 0 as h. This problem requires the relationship between the circumference of the circular path and the circumference of the cone's base.\n\nStep 9: \nWhen the cone rolls 17 times, the base of the cone will have rolled 17 times on the flat table.  Thus, in one rotation, it will roll one-seventeenth of this distance.\n\nStep 10: \nSince the circumference of the circular path is equal to the distance the cone travels in one rotation, we can say that the circumference of the circular path is $\\frac{1}{17}$ of the circumference of the base. Hence, $2\\pi\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2} = \\frac{1}{17}(2\\pi r)$.\n\nStep 11: \nDivide both sides of the equation by $2\\pi$: $\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2} = \\frac{1}{17}r$.\n\nStep 12: \nNow, square both sides: $r^2 + h^2 = \\frac{1}{289}r^2$.\n\nStep 13: \nDelete $r^2$: $h^2 = \\frac{-1}{289}r^2$.\n\nStep 14: \nHence, $h = \\frac{-1}{17\\sqrt{289}}r = -\\frac{1}{17\\cdot17}r = -\\frac{1}{17\\cdot17}r = \\frac{-1}{289}r$.\n\nStep 15: \nIn order to satisfy this kind of case, use a relationship between the circumference of the circular path and the circumference of the cone's base.\n\nStep 16: \nWe must now take the absolute value of h, i.e.  $\\frac{\\lvert h \\rvert}{\\lvert r \\rvert}$.\n\nStep 17: \nThe ratio of h to r can then be written as $\\frac{1}{17\\sqrt{289}} = \\frac{1}{17\\cdot17} = \\frac{1}{289}$.\n\nStep 18: \nFinally, take the square root of both sides of the equation, and we get the required ratio of h to r as $\\frac{1}{17\\sqrt{289}}$.\n\nStep 19: \nThen extract the integer values from the expression and add them up to get the answer.\n\nStep 20: \nFrom the expression $h/r = \\frac{1}{17\\sqrt{289}}$, the integer part of $h/r$ is 1 and the square root of the integer part of  the denominator is 17, since there's a lack of a square root for this case.\n\n\nThus, the required ratio of h to r can be written as $1/\\sqrt{289}$, and the required form is $1*\\sqrt{289}$.\n\n\nThen add the values and obtain the answer.\n\n\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{310}$."

  "solution": "The path is a circle with radius equal to the slant height of the cone, which is $\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}}$.
