    "To find the area of square $ABCD$, let's first break down the given information.\n\nWe know that $BE = EF = FD = 30$. Since $E$ lies on side $AD$ and $F$ lies on side $BC$, $BE$, $EF$, and $FD$ form three equal segments on side $AB$ of the square $ABCD$. We also know that the length of each segment can be found by considering the entire length of the square as a side of a larger square, and then assuming it is divided into equal parts.\n\nLet the side length of square $ABCD$ be $x$.\n\nTriangle $BEC$ is a triangle where the lengths of the two shorter sides ($BE$ and $CE$) are known, with $CE = CD - BE = x - 30$ and $BE = 30$. \n\nAlso, we can determine that the hypotenuse $BC = CE + BE = x - 30 + 30 = x$.\n\nBy applying the Pythagorean theorem, we can now determine x as follows:\n\n$$(BE)^2 + (CE)^2 = (BC)^2$$ (a^2 + b^2 = c^2)\n\n$$30^2 + (x - 30)^2 = x^2$$ \n\n$$900 + x^2 - 60x + 900 = x^2$$\n\nNow let's solve the equation for x:\n\n$$-60x + 1800 = 0$$ \n\n$$x = \\frac{1800}{60}$$\n\n$$x = 30$$\n\nThe area of square $ABCD$ is found by squaring the length of its side.\n\n$$Area = x^2$$\n\n$$Area = (30)^2$$\n\n$$Area = \\boxed{900}$$",
    "To find the area of square $ABCD$, we can start by understanding the given information. Points $E$ and $F$ divide the sides $AD$ and $BC$ of square $ABCD$ into three equal parts each.\n\nSince $BE = EF = FD = 30$, we can infer that $BE$ and $EF$ are the bases of two equal isosceles trapezoids formed by $E$ and $F$, which in turn makes $ABCD$ composed of three isosceles trapezoids.\n\nNext, let's consider point $O$ as the center of the square $ABCD$. Now, we can draw the perpendiculars $OD$ and $OE$ to $BC$ and $AD$, respectively. Also, let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$. \n\nGiven this information, if we consider right-angled triangles OMD and OME, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the $AD$ side.\n\nHowever, there's a more straightforward way to solve this problem. \n\nWe know that $\\angle AED$ is a right angle. Since the lengths of two sides $AE$ and $DE$ are each 30, we can consider these lengths as the legs of a $45-45-90$ right triangle. In a $45-45-90$ triangle, the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of a leg.\n\nThis applies to triangle AED as well. Now, the hypotenuse, $AE=ED=AD$, will be $30\\cdot\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nBased on the properties of a square, all four sides have equal length. Hence, the side $AD = 30\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTo find the area $K$ of the square $ABCD$, we need to square the side length: $K = (30\\sqrt{2})^{2}$.\n\nBy squaring $30\\sqrt{2}$, we get $[30\\sqrt{2}]^{2}$ = $(30)^{2}(\\sqrt{2})^{2}$.\n\n$(30)^{2}=900$, which is the square of the side length.\n\nAlso, $(\\sqrt{2})^{2}$ is simply $2$.\n\nTherefore, the area $K$ of square $ABCD$ is $K = 900 \\times 2 = 1800$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{1800}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Pythagorean Theorem. Let's break down the solution into steps.\n\nStep 1:  Visualize the given square $ABCD$ and the points $E$ and $F$ as described in the problem.\n\nStep 2:  Draw the altitude from point $F$ to side $AD$, which intersects side $AD$ at point $G$. This helps us to create a right-angled triangle $\\triangle BGF$.\n\nStep 3:  From the given information, $BG = 30 + 30 = 60$ since point $E$ is $30$ units away from point $A$, and there's another $30$-unit segment from $E$ to the end of square $ABCD$.\n\nStep 4:  Since the sides of the square $ABCD$ are equal, the side length of the square is $x$, i.e., $AB = BC = CD = DA = x$.\n\nStep 5:  From the right-angled triangle $\\triangle BGF$, using the Pythagorean Theorem, we have:\n\n$$x^2 + (x+30)^2 = 90^2 + (60)^2.$$\n\nStep 6:  Simplifying the equation gives:\n$$x^2 + x^2 + 60x + 900 = 8100 + 3600.$$\nStep 7:  Combining like terms and simplifying further:\n$$2x^2 + 60x - 11500 = 0.$$\n\nStep 8:  We can solve this quadratic equation by using the quadratic formula.\n\n$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$\n\n$$a = 2, b = 60, c = -11500.$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{-60 \\pm \\sqrt{3600 + 92000}}{4}$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{-60 \\pm \\sqrt{96800}}{4}$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{-60 \\pm 312}{4}$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{-60 + 312}{4} \\text{ or } x = \\frac{-60 - 312}{4}$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{252}{4} \\text{ or } x = \\frac{-372}{4}$$\n\n$$x = 63 \\text{ or } x = -93$$\n\nSince length cannot be negative, we choose $x = 63$ as our solution.\n\nStep 9:  To find the area of the square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is the square of its side length.\n\nArea of square $ABCD = x^2$\n\n$= (63)^2$\n\n$= 3969$\n\n$= \\boxed{3969}$"
