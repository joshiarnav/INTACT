    "To find the minimum area of $\\triangle AI_1I_2$, we need to find the relationship between the side lengths of $\\triangle AI_1I_2$ and the variation of $X$ along $\\overline{BC}$.\n\nStep 1: Observe that $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the incenters of $\\triangle ABX$ and $\\triangle ACX$. The angle bisector of the angle at $A$ also bisects the side lengths $I_1A$ and $I_2A$. To denote this bisector, we use the angle bisector theorem to state $I_1A = I_2A$. \n\nStep 2: To determine the lengths $I_1D$ and $I_2C$, use the fact that the angle bisector of $\\angle BAC$ also bisects the length $AI_1$ and $AI_2$. After bisecting in both $I_1$ and $I_2$, we now use the fact that triangle $A$ is bisecting triangle $BC$. Here we state that XA/AC = $B X/ BC$. \n\nStep 3: Expressing $I_1D$ and $I_2C$ in terms of $X$ \nGiven that $I_2C$ = $B X/ BC$ * $I_2C$ is the half with right angle between the triangle $B$ and $C$ * After putting that in equation and simplifying, we would get I2C = BX/BC * 32/2 = BX/BC * 16. Similarly, after putting all values in $I_1D = XA/AC * 16$ which is = 30X/34 *16 and $I_1D$ is equal to $I_2C$. \n\nStep 4: To find the minimum area of the triangle $AI_1I_2$, we first need to compute its altitudes from $A$.  \nWe can express that height from $A$ by computing $I_1G$ and $I_2G$, which is a line formed with two right angle with a line through ${I_2}$ and perpendicular to line $I_1A$ and the other one perpendicular from line $I_1I_2$ and through $B$. \n\nThe formulas used to find the length of those heights will be Altitude A \n= sqrt((AI1^2 + AI2^2) - (I1I2)^2).  \n\nStep 5:\nGet $AI_1$ and $AI_2$ lengths and after putting these equations into the formulas, we get the following: $AI1 = (15X - 204*(16/34))/41*(30X/34 - 16) $ and,  $AI 2 = (17X - 192*(16/34))/41*(16 - 30X/34) $ \nThese are now substituted in the altitude equation for finding the altitude from AI2 and AI1 to triangle AI1I2. \n\nStep 6:\nAs $I_1D$, in Eq. (I_1D = BX/BC * 16),  is also equal to  $I_2C$, $X$ must be equal to 16. Consequently, the length of the base $I_1I_2$ is 8, at which altitude A of triangle AI1I2 is minimum. Therefore, the minimum area of the triangle $AI_1I_2$ is:\n\n Area = 1/2 * $I_1D * Altitude A = 1/2 * 8 * 104 * sqrt(2)/2 = 416 * sqrt(2) \n\nTherefore, \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{416\\sqrt{2}}$",
