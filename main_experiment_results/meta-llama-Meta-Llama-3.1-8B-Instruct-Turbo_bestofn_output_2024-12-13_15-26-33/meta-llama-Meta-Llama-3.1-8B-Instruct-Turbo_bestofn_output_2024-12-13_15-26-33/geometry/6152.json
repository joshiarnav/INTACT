    "To solve this problem, let's break down the given information and proceed step by step.\n\nStep 1: Determine the properties of triangle $ABC$ using its side lengths. \nGiven that $AB=4$, $BC=5$, and $CA=6$, we can use Heron's formula to calculate the area of $\\triangle ABC$ as \n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)},\n\\]\nwhere $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$ is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\nFor $\\triangle ABC$, we have $s = \\frac{4+5+6}{2} = 7.5$. Plugging this into Heron's formula, we can calculate the area:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Area} &= \\sqrt{7.5\\cdot3.5\\cdot2.5\\cdot1.5} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{168.75} \\\\\n&= 13.\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom the given area, we can determine the circumradius $R$ of $\\triangle ABC$ using the formula $\\text{Area}=\\frac{abc}{4R}$:\n\\[\nR = \\frac{abc}{4\\text{Area}} = \\frac{4\\cdot 5\\cdot 6}{4 \\cdot 13} = \\frac{60}{13}.\n\\]\n\nStep 2: Determine the relationship between the points and the circumcircles of $\\triangle ACD$ and $\\triangle EBC$.\n\nLet's denote the circumcenter of $\\triangle ACD$ as $O_1$ and the circumcenter of $\\triangle EBC$ as $O_2$.\n\nThe point of intersection of the two circumcircles is point $F$. The fact that $\\triangle ABC$ has a circumcircle passing through $F$ implies that the lengths $AF$, $BF$, and $CF$ are equal to the circumradius $R$.\n\nUsing the distance formula, we can establish that $FC=CA=6$, $BF=BA=4$, and $AF=FC=6$. And as $FD=2$, we have $FD$ is the difference between the two circles and as that is known it can be used for the final equation.\n\nStep 3: Establish the equation for finding $BE$.\n\nLet $x = BE$. Knowing that projections of $BF$ and $FE$ onto $BC$ are congruent to $CF$, we can apply the concept of perpendicular lines to the circumcenters. By Pythagoras, $BC^2 = CF^2 + BF^2$. Substituting for known values we have \n$25 = 36 + x^2$ \nSolving this equation gives us the length $BE$:\n$BE = \\sqrt{11}.$\n\nStep 4: Express the length $BE$ in the given format.\n\nThe length $BE$ can be expressed as $\\tfrac{a+b\\sqrt{c}}{d}$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are positive integers such that $a$ and $d$ are relatively prime, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.\n\nHence, the expression for $BE$ in the required format is \n\\[\n\\frac{a + b\\sqrt{c}}{d} = \\frac{4 + 3\\sqrt{11}}{1},\n\\]\nwhere $a = 4$, $b = 3$, $c = 11$, and $d = 1$.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the final answer, $a + b + c + d$.\n\nThe final answer can be obtained by adding the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$:\n\\[\na + b + c + d = 4 + 3 + 11 + 1 = 19.\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$",
    "To solve this problem, we will break it down into several steps.\n\nStep 1: \nFirst, note that $\\angle{ECF}$ is common to the two circles, and therefore it is the inscribed angle and subtends the same arc on both circles. Since the arcs are symmetric about $EC$, the line $CF$ must be perpendicular to $EC$. So we have a right-angled triangle $CEF$ with hypotenuse $EF = 7$ and leg $CF$.\n\nStep 2: \nAlso, $DF = 2$ implies that $DC = DF + FC = 2 + CF = DF + CF$, and also $AD = AF$. Using Pythagoras in right triangle $ACD$, we get\n$AC^2 = AD^2 + DC^2$, \nso:\n$AC^2 = AD^2 + DF^2 + CF^2$ and \n$AC^2 = AF^2 + FC^2 + DF^2$ since $AD=AF$. Therefore:\n$AC^2=AD^2+2\\cdot FC^2$ and \n$AC^2=AF^2+2\\cdot FC^2$, implying that $AD = AF = AC$.\n\nStep 3: \nSince $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle ACF$, we find that $AC/BC = AC/CF$, implying that $CF = BC$.\n\nStep 4: \nWe then have $\\triangle CEF \\sim \\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle ACF$, so $CF/BC = BC/CA$, and we can say that $CF = BC \\cdot (BC/CA)$, so $CF = BC^2 / CA$, or $CF = 25/6$, implying that $\\angle{FBC} = \\angle{FBC} = \\angle{ABC}$. Step 5: \nWe observe that $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle BEC$.  Therefore, since the triangles are similar, the lengths of the corresponding sides of the similar triangles are in proportion. Therefore, we get that $BC/BE = AC/AB$, and we can solve for $BE$: $$BE = AB * CA / BC$.  Therefore, $BE = 4*6 / 5 = 24/5$.\n\nStep 6: \nIt can be expressed as $\\tfrac{24}{5= a+b\\sqrt{c}}{d}$ to solve the problem problem with $a=24$, $b=0$, $c=0$, and $d=5$.\n\nStep 7: \nTherefore the final answer to the problem problem is: $\\boxed{24+0+0+5=29}$"
