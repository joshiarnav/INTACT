    "To find the area of the triangle, we need to use the extended law of sines, which states that for any triangle inscribed in a circle with radius $R$, and with the length of side $a$ opposite to the vertex $A$ and the length of the arc subtended by the side $a$ is $s_a$, then we have:\n\n$$\\frac{a}{\\sin(A)} = 2R.$$\n\nUsing this, we can find the length of the sides of the triangle, but it would be more efficient to use the formula:\n\n$$\\frac{K}{R^2} = \\frac{a}{2R}\\cdot \\frac{b}{2R}\\cdot \\frac{c}{2R}\\cdot \\frac{\\sin \\alpha}{a}\\cdot \\frac{\\sin\\beta}{b}\\cdot \\frac{\\sin\\gamma}{c}$$\n\nThen because $\\frac{a}{2R}\\cdot \\frac{b}{2R}\\cdot \\frac{c}{2R} = \\frac{1}{32R^3}$ and $\\frac{\\sin \\alpha}{a}\\cdot \\frac{\\sin\\beta}{b}\\cdot \\frac{\\sin\\gamma}{c} =\\frac{1}{2R^3}\\cdot \\frac{\\pi - A}{6}$ which then results in:\n\n$$\\frac{K}{R^2} = \\frac{1}{32R^3}\\cdot \\frac{\\pi - A}{6}$$\n\nBut we have to find an expression for the radius. To find an expression for $R$, we use the formula that relates the length of the sides of the triangle to the measure of its angles and the length of its semiperimeter.\n\n$$K = R^2\\cdot \\frac{a}{2R}\\cdot \\frac{b}{2R}\\cdot \\frac{c}{2R}\\cdot \\frac{\\pi - A}{6}$$\n\nUsing the fact that the circumadius is, $R =  \\frac{a}{2\\sin(\\frac{A}{2})}$ (because this was derived using the defination of sin where ($sin A / 2 = opposite / hypotenuse$ where the hypotenuse is the length of the radius, and the  we simply compute the area $K$).\n\nNow we must find the measure of angle A (a) from the lengths of the circular arc subtended by the angle A (i.e. s_a = arc A) orderly by  $\\frac{s_a}{2\\pi r}$ where we have $r = 1$ . Thus $s_a = \\frac{2\\pi A}{360}  \\implies A = \\frac{360s_a}{2\\pi}$\n\nSubstituting $s_a =3,4,5$, we get: $\\frac{\\pi A}{180} = (3,4,5)$.\n\n(we need to use colatitude $90-A$ as this gives us the angle in the inscribed triangle A. Since the points A  , B , C are symmetric to the points A'  , B', C', we can compute the area using the expression $K = R^2\\cdot 90 - A\\sin(90-A')$ )\n\nThus $90 - A = (180-90- \\pi ,180- 90- 4\\pi /5 ), 180 - 90 -5\\pi /6)$ respectively.\n\nUsing $K = R^2\\cdot 90 - A\\sin(90-A)$ yields $K = ( \\frac{27}{4}, \\frac{32}{5}, \\frac{45}{18}  )$\n\nSince  we have $ ( , 4, 5 ) = \\frac{  \\pi^2}{K}   $ Hence we can find $ K = \\frac{4^2+ 5^2-2\\cdot 4 - 5 \\cdot \\sin(90- \\frac{360 \\cdot (3 + 4 + 5)}{2\\pi}) }{2\\pi^2}   $ \n\nHence we find that $ K  =  \\frac{9}{\\pi^2} (\\sqrt{3}+3)$ thus the answer is  $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{\\pi^2} (\\sqrt{3}+3)}$.",
    "To find the area of the triangle, we'll start by finding the radius of the circle. The circumference of the circle is the sum of the lengths of the three arcs, which is $3 + 4 + 5 = 12$. The circumference of a circle is given by the formula $C = 2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n$2\\pi r = 12$\n\nTo find the radius, we'll divide both sides of the equation by $2\\pi$:\n\n$r = \\frac{12}{2\\pi}$\n\n$r = \\frac{6}{\\pi}$\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can use the Extended Law of Sines to find the area of the triangle. The Extended Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of its opposite angle is equal to the diameter of the circumscribed circle. Since we're given the lengths of the arcs, we know the measure of the central angles that subtend those arcs. The measure of the central angle is given by the formula:\n\n$\\theta = \\frac{s}{r}$\n\nwhere $s$ is the length of the arc and $r$ is the radius of the circle.\n\nFor the first arc, the central angle is:\n\n$\\angle AOB = \\frac{3}{\\frac{6}{\\pi}}$\n\n$\\angle AOB = \\frac{3\\pi}{6}$\n\n$\\angle AOB = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$\n\nFor the second arc, the central angle is:\n\n$\\angle BOC = \\frac{4}{\\frac{6}{\\pi}}$\n\n$\\angle BOC = \\frac{4\\pi}{6}$\n\n$\\angle BOC = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$\n\nFor the third arc, the central angle is:\n\n$\\angle COD = \\frac{5}{\\frac{6}{\\pi}}$\n\n$\\angle COD = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$\n\nNow, we can use the Extended Law of Sines to find the length of the sides of the triangle.

Heron's formula states that for a triangle with sides of length $a$, $b$, and $c$, the area is given by:\n\n$A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$\n\nwhere $s$ is the semiperimeter of the triangle, given by:\n\n$s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$\n\nThe semiperimeter of the triangle is:\n\n$s = \\frac{6 + 8 + 6}{2}$\n\n$s = 10$\n\nNow, we can plug in the values we found earlier:\n\n$A = \\sqrt{10(10-6)(10-8)(10-6)}$\n\n$A = \\sqrt{10(4)(2)(4)}$\n\n$A = \\sqrt{320}$\n\n$A = \\sqrt{64 \\cdot 5}$\n\n$A = \\sqrt{64} \\cdot \\sqrt{5}$\n\n$A = 8 \\sqrt{5}$\n\nHowever, that is not an answer option.

  "solution": "The three arcs make up the entire circle, so the circumference of the circle is $3+4+5=12$ and the radius is $\\frac{12}{2\\pi}=\\frac{6}{\\pi}$. Also, the lengths of the arcs are proportional to their corresponding central angles. Thus, we can write the values of the arcs as $3\\theta$, $4\\theta$, and $5\\theta$ for some $\\theta$. By Circle Angle Sum, we obtain $3\\theta+4\\theta+5\\theta=360$. Solving yields $\\theta=30$. Thus, the angles of the triangle are $90$, $120$, and $150$.
