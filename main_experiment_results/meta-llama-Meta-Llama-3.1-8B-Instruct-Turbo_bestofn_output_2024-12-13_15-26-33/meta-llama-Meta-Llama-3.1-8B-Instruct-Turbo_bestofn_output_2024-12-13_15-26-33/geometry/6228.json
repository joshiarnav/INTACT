    "To solve this problem, we can use the angle bisector theorem. \n\nFirst, we need to recall the angle bisector theorem, which states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments that are in proportion to the other two sides.  \n\nSince we have a ratio $AC:CB = 3:4$, we can let $AC = 3x$ and $CB = 4x$.\n\nNow, let $AB = c$ and $PA = y$, so $PB = PA + AB = y + c$.\n\nWe are given that the bisector of the exterior angle at $C$ intersects $BA$ extended at $P$.\n\nThe angle bisector theorem for the exterior angle can be more complicated, so we instead use the property that the exterior angle bisector is proportional to the adjacent sides. So, it is true that,\n\n$$\\frac{AC}{CB} = \\frac{AP}{BP}$$\n\nThus we get,\n\n$$\\frac{3x}{4x} = \\frac{AP}{BP}$$\n\nSimplifying the above equation, we get,\n\n$$\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{AP}{AP + AB}$$\n\nSubstituting $y$ for $AP$ and $c$ for $AB$, we get,\n\n$$\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{y}{y + c}$$\n\nCross multiplying the above equation, we get,\n\n$$3y + 3c = 4y$$\n\nSubtracting $3c$ from both sides of the equation, we get,\n\n$$3c = y$$\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by $3$, we get,\n\n$$c = \\frac{y}{3}$$\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by $c$, we get,\n\n$$1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{y}{c}$$\n\nSimplifying the above equation, we get,\n\n$$1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{y}{c}$$\n\nCross multiplying, we get,\n\n$$3 = \\frac{y}{c}$$\n\nSubstituting $c = \\frac{y}{3}$, we get,\n\n$$3 = \\frac{y}{y/3}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get,\n\n$$3 = 3$$\n\nBut we were asked to find the ratio $PA:AB$, so we need to divide both sides of the equation by $c$, but not only that we need to multiply $y$ by $3$ and divide by $c$ to get the final value for the ratio $PA:AB$.\n\nThus, \n\n$$\\frac{PA}{AB} = \\frac{y}{c} \\div c$$ \n\n$$\\frac{PA}{AB} = \\frac{y}{c} * \\frac{3}{c}$$\n\n$$\\frac{PA}{AB} = \\frac{3y}{c^2}$$\n\n$$\\frac{PA}{AB} = \\frac{3y}{(y/3)^2}$$\n\n$$\\frac{PA}{AB} = \\frac{3y}{y^2/9}$$\n\n$$\\frac{PA}{AB} = \\frac{27y}{y^2}$$\n\n$$\\frac{PA}{AB} = \\frac{27}{y}$$\n\n$$\\frac{PA}{AB} = \\frac{3}{y/9}$$\n\nThus, \n\n$$\\frac{PA}{AB} = 3:1$$\n\n\n Therefore, the answer is,\n\n$$\\boxed{3:1}$$",
