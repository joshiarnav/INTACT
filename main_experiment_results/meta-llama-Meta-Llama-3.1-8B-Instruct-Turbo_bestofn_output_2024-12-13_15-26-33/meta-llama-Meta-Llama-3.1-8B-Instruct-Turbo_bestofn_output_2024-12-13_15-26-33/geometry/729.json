    "To find the volumes of the two tubes, we first need to determine the radius of each cylinder. \n\nAmy tapes the two 8-inch sides together, so the height of her cylinder is 8 inches. The circumference of her cylinder is equal to the 6-inch width of the paper. We can use the formula $C=2\\pi r$ to find the radius, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n\nIn this case, we have $6=2\\pi r$. To find the value of r, we can rearrange the equation to get: \n\n$2\\pi r = 6$\n$r = 6/(2\\pi)$\n$r = 3/\\pi$\n\nNow that we know the radius of Amy's cylinder, we can find its volume using the formula $V=\\pi r^2h$, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height:\n\n$V_A = \\pi (3/\\pi)^2 (8)$\n$V_A = \\pi (9/\\pi^2) (8)$\n$V_A = 72/\\pi$\n\nNow let's find the volume of Belinda's cylinder.

To find the value of r, we can rearrange the equation to get:\n\n$2\\pi r = 8$\n$r = 8/(2\\pi)$\n$r = 4/\\pi$\n\nNow that we know the radius of Belinda's cylinder, we can find its volume using the same formula $V=\\pi r^2h$:\n\n$V_B = \\pi (4/\\pi)^2 (6)$\n$V_B = \\pi (16/\\pi^2) (6)$\n$V_B = 96/\\pi$\n\nThe positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes is $V_B-V_A$:\n\n$V_B-V_A = 96/\\pi-72/\\pi$\n$V_B-V_A = (96-72)/\\pi$\n$V_B-V_A = 24/\\pi$\n\nSince we need to find $\\pi$ times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes, we can multiply the difference by $\\pi$:\n\n$\\pi(V_B-V_A)=\\pi (24/\\pi)$\n$\\pi(V_B-V_A) = 24$\n\nThe answer should be in the format $\\boxed{answer}$, so we will present the result in this format: \n\n$\\boxed{24}$",
