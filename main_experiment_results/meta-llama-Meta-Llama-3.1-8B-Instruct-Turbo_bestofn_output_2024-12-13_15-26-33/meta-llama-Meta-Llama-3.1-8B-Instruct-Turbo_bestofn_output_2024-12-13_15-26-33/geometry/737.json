    "To find the volume of the sphere, we first need to find the radius. We're given the surface area of the sphere, which is $324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$. The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula:\n\n$A = 4\\pi r^2$\n\nwhere $A$ is the surface area and $r$ is the radius of the sphere. \n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\n$324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2$\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by $4\\pi$ to isolate $r^2$:\n\n$81 = r^2$\n\nNow, we can take the square root of both sides to find the radius:\n\n$r = \\sqrt{81}$\n$r = 9$\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula:\n\n$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$\n\nSubstitute $r = 9$ into the formula:\n\n$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (9)^3$\n$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (729)$\n$V = 972\\pi$\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is $972\\pi$ cubic centimeters.\n\n$\\boxed{972\\pi}$",

  "solution": "Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2.\\]  Solving for $r$ and keeping the positive value yields $r^2=81$, so $r = 9$.  Hence the volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=81\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\pi = \\boxed{972\\pi}.\\]",
