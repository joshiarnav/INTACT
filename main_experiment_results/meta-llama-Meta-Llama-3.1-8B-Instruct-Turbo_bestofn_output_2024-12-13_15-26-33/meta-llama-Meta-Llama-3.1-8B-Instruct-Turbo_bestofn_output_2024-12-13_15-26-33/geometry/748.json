    "To find the length of $\\widehat{BC}$, we need to first find the radius of the circle, since the length of an arc of a circle is given by the formula $L = \\frac{\\theta}{360}\\cdot 2\\pi r$, where $L$ is the length of the arc, $\\theta$ is the central angle subtended by the arc, and $r$ is the radius of the circle.\n\nGiven that the circumference of the circle is 60 feet, we know that $2\\pi r=60$. \n\nWe can solve for $r$:\n\\begin{align*}\n2\\pi r&=60\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad r&=\\frac{60}{2\\pi}=\\frac{30}{\\pi}\n\\end{align*}\n\nNext, we need to find the central angle subtended by the arc $\\widehat{BC}$.  We are given that this central angle is $60^{\\circ}$. Now, we can apply the formula for the length of an arc of a circle to find the length of $\\widehat{BC}$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nL&=\\frac{\\theta}{360}\\cdot 2\\pi r\\\\\n&=\\frac{60}{360}\\cdot 2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{30}{\\pi}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{6}\\cdot 60\\\\\n&=\\boxed{10}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "To find the length of $\\widehat{BC}$, we first need to find the radius or circumference of the circle and then calculate the fraction of the circumference covered by the arc $BC$.\n\nGiven that the circumference of the circle is 60 feet, we can use the formula for the circumference of a circle: $C = 2\\pi r$, where $C$ is the circumference and $r$ is the radius. Rearranging this formula to solve for the radius, we get:\n\n$r = \\frac{C}{2\\pi} = \\frac{60}{2\\pi}$.\n\nHowever, we do not actually need to calculate the radius. We can move directly to the next part of the problem.\n\nA full circle has a $360^\\circ$ measure. To find the fraction of the circumference covered by the arc $BC$, we divide the measure of the angle $BCA$ by $360^\\circ$. Since the angle $BCA$ is $60^\\circ$, the fraction of the circumference covered by the arc $BC$ is $\\frac{60^\\circ}{360^\\circ} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nSo, the length of $\\widehat{BC}$ is $\\frac{1}{6}$ of the circumference of the circle. To find this, we multiply the circumference of the circle by $\\frac{1}{6}$:\n\nLength of $\\widehat{BC}$ = $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 60 = 10$ feet.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",
    "To find the length of $\\widehat{BC}$, we need to understand that it's an arc on the circle, and its length is proportional to the angle it subtends at the center of the circle.\n\nStep 1: Recall that the circumference of a circle is given by the formula $C = 2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.\n\nStep 2: Given the circumference of circle $A$ is 60 feet, we can use the formula to find the radius:\n\\[ 60 = 2\\pi r \\]\nTo solve for $r$, we divide both sides by $2\\pi$:\n\\[ r = \\frac{60}{2\\pi} = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nStep 3: The angle at the center of the circle subtended by $\\widehat{BC}$ is $60^\\circ$. To find the fraction of the circumference that this arc represents, we need to convert this angle to radians. Recall that $1$ radian is equal to $\\frac{180}{\\pi}$ degrees. So $60^\\circ$ is equal to $\\frac{60}{180}\\pi = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi$ radians.\n\nStep 4: The length of $\\widehat{BC}$ can be calculated as the fraction of the circumference that this arc represents, multiplied by the actual circumference of the circle. This fraction is the ratio of the angle in radians to the total angle in radians (which is $2\\pi$ since the whole circle is $2\\pi$ radians):\n\\[ \\text{Length of } \\widehat{BC} = 60 \\times \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}\\pi}{2\\pi} = 10 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of $\\widehat{BC}$ is $\\boxed{10}$."
