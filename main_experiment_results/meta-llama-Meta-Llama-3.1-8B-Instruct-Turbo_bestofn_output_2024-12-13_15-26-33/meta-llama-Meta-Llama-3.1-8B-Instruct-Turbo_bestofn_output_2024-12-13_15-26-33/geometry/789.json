    "To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of an equilateral triangle.\n\nStep 1: Let the side length of equilateral triangle $ABC$ be $s$. \n\nStep 2: Consider right triangle $CBD$. In this triangle, $CBD$ has a length of $s$ since it is a side of equilateral triangle $BCD$, and $CD$ is the height of triangle $BCD$, so $CD = s \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nStep 3: Using the right triangle $CBD$, we can obtain that the altitude of triangle $ABC$ is the same as the altitude of triangle $BCD$, so $BD = s \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nStep 4: Now, we need to find the altitude of triangle $ABD$. We can obtain this altitude using right triangle $CBD$, where $AD$ is the hypotenuse, and then we get $AD = 2 \\cdot s \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + s = s(\\sqrt{3} + 1)$. Note that this is a horizontal distance so $AD = s(\\sqrt{3} + 1)$.\n\n\n\nStep 5: To find the value of $AD \\div BC$, we will divide $s(\\sqrt{3} + 1)$ by $s$, which gives us:\n\n$$\\frac{AD}{BC} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{3} + 1}$$",
    "To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.\n\nStep 1:  We are given two equilateral triangles, $ABC$ and $BCD$, and we need to find the value of $AD \\div BC$ when expressed in the simplest radical form.\n\nStep 2:  The first thing to do is to analyze the properties of equilateral triangles. These triangles have all three sides of equal length and all three angles measuring $60^\\circ$.\n\nStep 3:  Let's assume the length of each side of the equilateral triangles is $s$. This means the length of side $BC$ is $s$ and the length of side $AD$ is $2s$ because it is made up of two sides of the equilateral triangles combined.\n\nStep 4:  In the figure, if we draw the line from $A$ to $D$, we can see that $AD$ forms a diagonal of a rectangle. If the length of the side of an equilateral triangle is $s$, then the height of the triangle $ABC$ or $BCD$ is $s\\sqrt{3}/2$.\n\nStep 5:  If we draw the altitude from point $B$ to side $AD$, we get two congruent right-angled triangles with angles $45^\\circ$, $45^\\circ$, and $90^\\circ$.\n\nStep 6:  In the right triangle with hypotenuse $s\\sqrt{3}$ and one leg $s/2$, using the Pythagorean theorem we have: $\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^{2}=s^{2}.$\n\nStep 7:  After simplifying the equation $\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^{2}=s^{2},$ we arrive at $s^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4} +\\frac{3}{4}\\right)=s^{2},$ which can be simplified to $s^{2} = s^{2}$.\n\nStep 8:  Now, let's move on to the next part where we calculate AD. This is done by finding BD, which can be represented as $s\\sqrt{3}$, and adding the height of the equilateral triangle. This is $s\\sqrt{3}+s\\sqrt{3}/2$. Simplifying this, we get $ \\left( \\frac{3}{2} +1\\right)s \\sqrt{3},$ which equals $\\frac{5}{2}s\\sqrt{3}.$\n\nStep 9:  To find AD, we can multiply the length of BD by 2, to get $\\frac{5}{1}s\\sqrt{3}.$ \n\nStep 10:  Therefore, we obtain $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}s\\sqrt{3}}$ as the value of AD."
