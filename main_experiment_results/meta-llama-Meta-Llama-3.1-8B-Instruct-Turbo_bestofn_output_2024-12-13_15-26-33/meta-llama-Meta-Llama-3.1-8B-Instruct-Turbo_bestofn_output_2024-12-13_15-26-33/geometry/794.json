    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $ABC$. \n\nStep 1: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $ABC$: \nGiven that $AC=6$ and $BC=8$, we can use the theorem to find $AB$. \n$AB = \\sqrt{AC^2 + BC^2}$\n$AB = \\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2}$\n$AB = \\sqrt{36 + 64}$\n$AB = \\sqrt{100}$\n$AB = 10$\n\nStep 2: Analyze triangle $DBE$: \nWe know that $DE = 4$, and we have already found $AB = 10$. Notice that $\\triangle DBE$ is similar to $\\triangle ABC$. The similarity of these triangles can be established by using the corresponding angle theorem, as the two triangles share a $90^\\circ$ angle at point $B$ and have another angle in common at point $E$, while both have a right angle at point $C$. For similar triangles, the sides are proportional.\n\nStep 3: Use the similarity of the triangles to set up a proportion between the sides. We want to find the length of $BD$.\nSince we have the lengths $AB = 10$ and $DE = 4$, we can set up the following proportion using the ratios of corresponding sides:\n$\\frac{BD}{BA}$ = $\\frac{DE}{AC}$\nStep 4: We can then substitute the given lengths into the proportion and solve for $BD$.\n$\\frac{BD}{10}$ = $\\frac{4}{6}$\nCross multiply:\n$6(BD) = 10 \\times 4$\n$6(BD) = 40$\nNow, divide both sides by 6:\n$BD = \\frac{40}{6}$\nSimplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (gcd), which is 2.\n$BD = \\frac{20}{3}$\n\nTherefore, the length of $BD$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{20}{3}}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. We have a right-angled triangle, $ABC$, where $\\angle C = 90^\\circ$, and $AC=6$ and $BC=8$.

According to the Pythagorean Theorem, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
