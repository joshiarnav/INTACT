    "To find the distance of point A from its original position, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Given Information**:\n   - Area of the square sheet of paper: $6 \\text{ cm}^2$.\n   - The front (side A) is white, and the back (side B) is black.\n   - When the sheet is folded so that point A rests on the diagonal, the visible black area equals the visible white area.\n\n2. **Forming an Equation**:\n   - Let $x$ represent the length of a leg of the black isosceles triangle formed after folding the sheet.\n   - The area of the black triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, and the area of the white portion is given by $6 - x^2$.\n   - Since the visible black area is equal to the visible white area, we can form the equation: $\\frac{1}{2}x^2 = 6 - x^2$.\n\n3. **Solving for $x^2$**:\n   - Add $x^2$ to both sides of the equation: $\\frac{1}{2}x^2 + x^2 = 6$.\n   - Combine like terms: $\\frac{3}{2}x^2 = 6$.\n   - Multiply both sides by $\\frac{2}{3}$: $x^2 = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 6 = 4$.\n\n4. **Finding the Length of a Leg**:\n   - Since $x^2 = 4$, $x = 2$ (considering length, not the negative value).\n\n5. **Finding the Distance of Point A from its Original Position**:\n   - The distance of point A from its original position, $s$, forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with leg lengths $x$ and $x$. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find $s$: $s^2 = x^2 + x^2 = 2 \\cdot x^2$.\n   - Substituting the value of $x^2$, we have $s^2 = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n   - Taking the square root of both sides, we get $s = \\sqrt{8}$.\n\nSimplifying the square root of 8 using $\\sqrt{8} = \\sqrt{4\\cdot2}=\\sqrt{4}\\cdot\\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, the distance of point A from its original position is $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$.",
