    "To find the volume of one piece of the pizza, we need to find the total volume of the pizza and then divide by 12.\n\n1. First, we need to find the volume of the entire pizza. The pizza is a cylinder, with a diameter of 12 inches, so the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 6 inches. \n\nThe formula for the volume of a cylinder is $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height (or thickness) of the cylinder.\n\nIn this case, $r = 6$ inches and $h = \\frac13$ of an inch. The volume of the entire pizza is:\n\n$V = \\pi \\times 6^2 \\times \\frac13$\n\n$V = \\pi \\times 36 \\times \\frac13$\n\n$V = 12 \\pi$\n\nThis is the total volume of the entire pizza.\n\n2. Now, we need to find the volume of one piece of the pizza. We already know that the total volume of the pizza is $12 \\pi$ cubic inches, and it's cut into 12 congruent pieces. \n\nTo find the volume of one piece, we divide the total volume of the pizza by 12. \n\nThe volume of one piece is $\\frac{12 \\pi}{12}$\n\nThe volume of one piece is $\\pi$\n\nSo, the volume of one piece of the pizza is $\\boxed{\\pi}$.",
