    "To begin, let's understand the problem. We have a square piece of paper $ABCD$ with all sides of length 6 cm, and we fold the paper to make the corner $C$ coincide with the midpoint $E$ of $\\overline{AD}$. The crease line $\\overline{GF}$ from the fold intersects $\\overline{CD}$ at point $F$, and we are asked to find the length of $\\overline{FD}$.\n\nAfter folding, $\\overline{CF}$ becomes $\\overline{EF}$ since we are reflecting one end of $\\overline{CF}$ to the other. As $ABCD$ is a square, the angles and therefore lengths along the fold are preserved. Given that $\\overline{EF}$ is opposite to the 6 cm side of the square, we have $\\overline{EF} = 6 - x$, where $x$ is the length of $\\overline{FD}$.\n\nNext, we apply the Pythagorean theorem to find $x$. In $\\bigtriangleup FEG$, we know that $\\overline{EG} = 3$ (the length is half of the side length of the square) and $\\overline{EF} = 6 - x$. $\\overline{GF} = x$ since we have unfolded one side and looked at it.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 + 3^2 &=(6-x)^2\\\\\nx^2 + 9  & = 36-12x +x^2\\\\\n9       & =36-12x\\\\\n12x & = 27\\\\\nx      & = \\frac{27}{12}\\\\\nx      & = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{4}}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo the length of $\\overline{FD}$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{4}}$",
    "To find the length of $\\overline{FD}$, we'll approach this problem step by step.\n\n1. **Static relationship and stay same under reflection:** Recognize that since $ABCD$ is a square, $AB=BC=CD=DA=6$ cm. The length of $\\overline{CE}$ is also 6 cm because it is the same length as $\\overline{AC}$.\n\n2. **Unfold the crease and look for a symmetric shape:** After folding, we have a vertex $F$ on $\\overline{CD}$ and a line representing the crease $\\overline{GF}$.\n\n3. **Isosceles Triangle Conditions:** The vertex $F$ will create a line segment $FD$ with length to be determined and the vertex $C$ will create a segment $CF$ when $F$ meet the pre fold line. Since $ABCD$ is a square, vertex $E$ splits $AD$ into two segments of equal length because it is a midpoint. So, we have $AE=ED=3$ cm.\n\n4. **Similar Triangles and solving for the crease variable:** Since $AB=6$ cm, in the scenario $FED$ with length of $\\overline{FD}$ to be determined $x$, we can look at the sum $3+x+3=6$ and decompose the $\\overline{CDE}$ to the already known segment $DE$, $3$. We can find that if you construct the line from $A$ to $F$, both triangles will share the same angles. Recognize that $\\triangle{FED} \\sim \\triangle{CDE}$ by AA similarity.\n\n5. **Ratio of corresponding sides are equal:** Use similarity to find the length of $\\overline{FD}$. The paired sides of the two triangles are proportional.\n\n   Since $FD:EF=CE:DE$, we have:\n   $$\n   \\frac{x}{6-x} = \\frac{6}{3}\n   $$\n\n   We can simplify the above equation as $x^2 - 18x + 36=0$. Notice that the above equation can be transformed into a quadratic equation. By doing that, we have: \n   $$\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   x^2 - 18x + 36 &=0\\\\\n   \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\qquad x &=\\frac{18\\pm \\sqrt{(-18)^2-4(36)}}{2}\\\\\n   \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\qquad x &=\\frac{18\\pm \\sqrt{324-144}}{2}\\\\\n   \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\qquad x &= \\frac{18 \\pm \\sqrt{180}}{2}\\\\\n   \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\qquad x &= \\frac{18 \\pm 6\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\\\\n   \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\qquad x &= 9 \\pm 3\\sqrt{5}.\n   \\end{aligned}\n   $$\n\n6. **Just select x in the domain of stay same under reflection:** Recognizing that if you construct a line from A to F, both triangles will share the same angles.\n\n   Notice that if you had increased the paired sides to the new ones that compared the ratio pairs $\\overline{DF}$ and $\\overline{EF}$, you'll get the result $\\frac{x}{6-x}=\\frac{6}{3}$.\n\n\n\n   Since $FD\\cap EF$ results two shared angles which are the two inner and the two outer, if you construct  the line so both triangles share the same two angles.
