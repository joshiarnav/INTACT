    "Step 1: To find the area of the shaded region, we first need to analyze the given regular hexagon.\n\nStep 2: The side length of the regular hexagon is given as 10 cm. \n\nStep 3: The shaded region consists of 4 equilateral triangles with side length 10 cm.\n\nStep 4: To find the area of one equilateral triangle, we will use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle which is $\\frac{(\\text{side})^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$. \n\nStep 5: Therefore, substituting 10 for the side in the above formula, we can calculate the area of an equilateral triangle. This will be $\\frac{10^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n\nStep 6: Simplifying this further, we get $\\frac{100\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ or $\\frac{25\\sqrt{3}}{1}$ square centimeters as the area of each equilateral triangle.\n\nStep 7: Since the shaded region consists of 4 equilateral triangles, we will multiply the area of one equilateral triangle by 4 to get the total area of the shaded region.\n\nStep 8: Multiplying $\\frac{25\\sqrt{3}}{1}$ by 4, we get $100\\sqrt{3}$ square centimeters as the total area of the shaded region.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the number of square centimeters in the area of the shaded region is $\\boxed{100\\sqrt{3}}$.",
