    "Step 1:  At 8:15, the minute hand will be pointing at the 3, and the hour hand will be between the 8 and the 9 on the clock.\nStep 2:  The first step is to determine the angles made by the minute and hour hands from the 12 o'clock position.\nStep 3:  Since the minute hand is at the 3, it moves 3/12 of the total 360 degrees around the clock. Thus, the angle covered by the minute hand is $\\left(\\frac{3}{12}\\right)360 = 90$ degrees.\nStep 4:  Moving on to the hour hand, we note that it's between the 8 and the 9. Since the hour hand also moves as the minutes pass, it will have moved some portion of the distance between the 7 and the 8. \nStep 5:  The hour hand covers 360 degrees in 12 hours. Therefore, in one hour, it covers $\\frac{360}{12} = 30$ degrees.\nStep 6:  Over 15 minutes, the hour hand will cover $\\frac{15}{60}\\cdot 30 = 7.5$ degrees.\nStep 7:  So, the hour hand will be $8\\cdot30=240$ degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\nStep 8:  At 8:15, the hour hand has moved 7.5 degrees from its position at the 8, and since it's between the 8 and the 9, the position of the hour hand is at $240 + 7.5 = 247.5$ degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\nStep 9:  To find the smaller angle between the two hands, we can find the difference between the angles made by the hour and minute hands.\nStep 10:  The absolute difference between the angles made by the hour and minute hands is $|247.5 - 90| = 157.5$ degrees.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands at 8:15 is $157.5$ degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{157.5}$",
    "To determine the number of degrees in the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock at 8:15, we need to calculate the degrees moved by both hands.\n\nThe hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours. This means that the hour hand moves 30 degrees per hour or 0.5 degrees per minute. \n\nAt 8:15, the hour hand is 8 and a half hours ahead. This translates to 8 * 30 + 0.5 * 15 = 240 + 7.5 = 247.5 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nNext, we need to find out how far the minute hand has moved. The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes. This means that the minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute. \n\nAt 15 minutes past the hour, the minute hand is at 15 * 6 = 90 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nTo find the angle between the hour and minute hands, we need to find the absolute difference between their positions. The angle between the two hands is |247.5 - 90| = 157.5 degrees.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{157.5}$.",
    "To find the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of the clock at 8:15, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the angle moved by the hour hand:\n\nAt 8:00, the hour hand is at the 8 and has moved $\\frac{8}{12} \\times 360 = 240$ degrees from the top of the clock. \n\nBetween 8:00 and 8:15, the hour hand moves $\\frac{15}{60} \\times \\frac{360}{12} = 15 \\times \\frac{30}{1} = 45$ degrees.\n\nSo, the total angle moved by the hour hand is $240 + 45 = 285$ degrees.\n\n2. Calculate the angle moved by the minute hand:\n\nAt 8:00, the minute hand is at the top and has moved $0$ degrees. \n\nBetween 8:00 and 8:15, the minute hand moves $\\frac{15}{60} \\times 360 = 90$ degrees.\n\n3. Find the angle between the two hands:\n\nThe angle between the hour hand and the minute hand is the smaller angle between 360 and $285 - 90 = 195$ degrees, and the other angle between $0 and 195$ degrees, which is given by $360 - 195 = 165$ degrees.\n\nSince we are looking for the smaller angle, we'll choose 165 degrees as the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of the clock at 8:15.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n$\\boxed{165.0}$"

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 1 and Solution 2, as they both provide the correct answer of 157.5 degrees. However, since Solution 3 provides a different answer (165 degrees), we will consider Solution 1 and Solution 2 as the best solutions.\n\nSince both Solution 1 and Solution 2 are correct, and they are considered equally good, we will choose the smaller index number, which is 1.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "solution": "At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{2}{3}(360^\\circ)=240$ degrees.  Every minute, the minute hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}(360^\\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12} (360^\\circ)=0.5$ degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.  After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\\circ-5.5^\\circ\\cdot 15=\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees.",
