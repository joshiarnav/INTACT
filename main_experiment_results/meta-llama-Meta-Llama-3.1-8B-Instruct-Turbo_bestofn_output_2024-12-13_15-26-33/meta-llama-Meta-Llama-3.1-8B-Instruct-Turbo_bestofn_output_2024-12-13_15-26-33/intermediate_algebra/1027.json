    "To find the set of all possible values of $f(x,y,z)$, we need to analyze the given function and see if we can simplify or apply any inequalities.\n\nLet's start by simplifying the expression:\n\n\\[f(x,y,z) = \\frac{x}{x + y} + \\frac{y}{y + z} + \\frac{z}{z + x}.\\]\n\nNotice that each term is a fraction where the numerator is one of the variables and the denominator is the sum of two variables. \n\nWe can start by analyzing the numerator and denominator of each term. Since all three variables are positive, we can assume that each fraction is positive, since a fraction is positive if the numerator and the denominator have the same sign.\n\nTo find the maximum or minimum value of $f(x,y,z)$, we can apply the inequality relationships between the variables.\n\nSince all three variables are positive, we can apply the inequality relationships:\n\n1. The sum of two fractions is less than or equal to 1.\n\nConsider the following inequalities:\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{x + y} \\leq 1 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{y}{y + z} \\leq 1 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{z}{z + x} \\leq 1 \\]\n\nSince each fraction is less than or equal to 1, the sum of these fractions must be less than or equal to $3/2$. \n\nHowever, we must also consider the lower bound of the sum. \n\nLet's analyze the lower bound:\n\nThe difference between each term and $1$ is also non-negative.\n\nConsider the following inequalities:\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{x + y} - 1 \\geq 0 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{y}{y + z} - 1 \\geq 0 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{z}{z + x} - 1 \\geq 0 \\]\n\nBy solving these inequalities, we can get the following results:\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{x + y} \\geq \\frac{x}{x + y + z} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{y}{y + z} \\geq \\frac{y}{y + x + z} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{z}{z + x} \\geq \\frac{z}{x + y + z} \\]\n\nNow, we can sum these inequalities:\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{x + y} + \\frac{y}{y + z} + \\frac{z}{z + x} \\geq \\frac{x}{x + y + z} + \\frac{y}{x + y + z} + \\frac{z}{x + y + z} = \\frac{x + y + z}{x + y + z} = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n\\[ 1 \\leq \\frac{x}{x + y} + \\frac{y}{y + z} + \\frac{z}{z + x} \\]\n\nIn addition, as previously shown, the sum of the three fractions is less than or equal to $3/2$.\n\nCombining the inequalities, we get:\n\n\\[ 1 \\leq \\frac{x}{x + y} + \\frac{y}{y + z} + \\frac{z}{z + x} \\leq \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\nThis is the range of values for the function $f(x,y,z)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(1,3/2]}$",
