    "To find the positive value of $t$ that satisfies $ab = t-2i$, we'll first use the properties of complex numbers and absolute values.\n\nWe are given $|a|=2$ and $|b|=\\sqrt{26}$, and we know that the absolute value of the product of two complex numbers is equal to the product of their absolute values. In other words, $|ab|=|a|\\cdot |b|$.\n\nSince $ab = t-2i$, we have $|ab|= \\sqrt{t^2+4}$ (because the absolute value of $t-2i$ is $\\sqrt{t^2+4}$).\n\nNow, we can use the property $|ab|=|a|\\cdot |b|$:\n\n$$|ab|=|a|\\cdot |b|=\\sqrt{t^2+4}=2\\cdot\\sqrt{26}=\\sqrt{4\\cdot26}=\\sqrt{104}$$\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n$$t^2+4=104$$\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides:\n\n$$t^2=100$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$$t= \\pm10$$\n\nSince we are looking for the positive value of $t$, we take $t = \\boxed{10}$.",
