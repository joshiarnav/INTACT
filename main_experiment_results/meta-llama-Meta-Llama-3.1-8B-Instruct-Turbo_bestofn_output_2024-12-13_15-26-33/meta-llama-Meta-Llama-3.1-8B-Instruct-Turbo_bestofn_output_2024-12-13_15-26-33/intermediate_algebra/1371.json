    "To find $f(91) + f(-91)$, we need to first find $f(91)$ and $f(-91)$. \n\nGiven that $f(x) = ax^6 + bx^4 - cx^2 + 3$ and $f(91) = 1$, we can substitute $x = 91$ into the function.\n\n$f(91) = a(91)^6 + b(91)^4 - c(91)^2 + 3$\n\nSince, we know $f(91) = 1$,\n\n$1 = a(91)^6 + b(91)^4 - c(91)^2 + 3$\n\nLet's consider $f(-x)$. \n\n$f(-x) = a(-x)^6 + b(-x)^4 - c(-x)^2 + 3$\n\nSince the even powers will remain the same, we have,\n\n$f(-x) = a(x)^6 + b(x)^4 - c(x)^2 + 3$\n\nSo, $f(-x) = f(x)$.\n\n$f(-91)ginas  f(91)$\n\n$f(-91) = 1$\n\nNow we have $f(91) = f(-91) = 1$. Adding these two we get \n\n$f(91) + f(-91) = 1 + 1$\n\nThe answer to the question is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to find $f(-91)$ first and then add it to $f(91)$. \n\nSince $f(x) = ax^6 + bx^4 - cx^2 + 3$, we can substitute $-x$ for $x$ to find $f(-x)$:\n$f(-x) = a(-x)^6 + b(-x)^4 - c(-x)^2 + 3$\n$f(-x) = ax^6 + bx^4 - cx^2 + 3$\n\nAs you can see, $f(-x) = f(x)$. This is because even powers of $-x$ are equal to the corresponding powers of $x$. So $f(-91) = f(91)$.\n\nWe know that $f(91) = 1$, therefore:\n$f(-91) = f(91) = 1$\n\nNow we need to find $f(91) + f(-91)$:\n$f(91) + f(-91) = 1 + 1 = 2$\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{2}$."

  "critique": "Both solutions are correct and yield the same answer, $\\boxed{2}$. However, the best solution can be considered as the one that is more concise and easier to understand. \n\nBetween the two solutions, Solution 1 is more concise and directly addresses the problem, whereas Solution 2 provides a more detailed explanation of the process. However, both solutions are clear and easy to follow.\n\nTherefore, I would consider Solution 1 as the best solution.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
