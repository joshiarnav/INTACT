    "To find the range of the function, we want to find all possible values of $y$ such that the equation $y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}$ has a solution for $x$.\n\nStep 1: Rearrange the equation to isolate $x$.\n\\[y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}\\]\nCross multiply to get:\n\\[yx^2-2xy+xy+y=0\\]\n\\[yx^2 -(y+1)x +y =0\\]\n\nStep 2: Solve the quadratic equation for $x$.\nWe can use the quadratic formula, where $a=y$, $b=-(y+1)$, and $c=y$.\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-(b) \\pm \\sqrt{(b)^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nSubstitute $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the formula:\n\\[x = \\frac{(y+1) \\pm \\sqrt{(y+1)^2 - 4(y)(y)}}{2y} \\]\n\\[x = \\frac{(y+1) \\pm \\sqrt{(y+1)^2 - 4y^2}}{2y} \\]\n\\[x = \\frac{(y+1) \\pm \\sqrt{y^2+2y+1-4y^2}}{2y} \\]\n\\[x = \\frac{(y+1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2y^2+y+1)}}{2y}  \\]\n\\[x = \\frac{(y+1) \\pm \\sqrt{-2y^2+ y +1}}{2y}  \\]\nThis equation should have real solutions for $x$ for $y$ in the range where the discriminant, $(-2y^2+y+1)$, is greater than or equal to $0$.\n\nStep 3: Determine the conditions on $y$ for which the discriminant is non-negative.\n\\begin{align*}\n-2y^2+y+1 &\\ge 0 \\\\\n(-2y+1)^2-2(2y+1) &\\ge0 \\\\\n2y^2-2y +1-4y-2 &\\ge0 \\\\\n2y^2-6y-1 &\\ge0\n\\end{align*}\n\nStep 4: Solve the quadratic inequality to find the values of $y$ for which the discriminant is non-negative.\n\nThe inequality $2y^2-6y-1 \\ge 0$ can be solved by first dividing both sides by $2$.\n\\[y^2 - 3y - \\frac{1}{2} \\ge 0 \\]\nUsing the quadratic formula to find the roots of the corresponding equation:\n\\[y= \\frac{-(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2-4(1)(-\\frac{1}{2})}}{2(1)} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9}+\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\]\nSince $y = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9}+\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ are our expected roots, these values will define the inequality either side of them.\nIt is relatively less complex to set up a sign chart to determine the values of $y$ for which the inequality holds, as it is easier to read from, and using the quadratic formula provides insight into the distinct roots.\n\n\\[ y \\in (-\\infty, \\frac{3 -  \\sqrt{9}+\\sqrt{2}}{2}) \\ \\cup \\ (\\frac{3 +  \\sqrt{9}+\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\infty) \\]\n\nStep 5: Find the range of $y$ for the original function.\n\nThe range will be the interval where $y$ is defined, given that there are real roots:\n\\[\\boxed{(-\\infty, \\frac{3 -  \\sqrt{9}+\\sqrt{2}}{2}) \\ \\cup \\ (\\frac{3 +  \\sqrt{9}+\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\infty)}\\]",
    "To find the range of the function, we need to consider all possible values of $f(x)$ as $x$ varies over the real numbers. \n\nStep 1: Find the denominator $y$ of $f(x)$ in terms of the numerator $x$.\n\nLet $y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}.$ \n\nThen, $xy = x$ and $y(x^2 - x + 1) = x.$\n\nStep 2: Simplify the equation from step 1.\n\nNow we have $yx^2 - yx + y = x.$\n\nStep 3: Move all the terms to the left side of the equation.\n\nWe get $yx^2 - yx - x + y = 0.$\n\nStep 4: Factor out $x$ from the terms $-yx -x$ and combine the like terms.\n\nWe get $yx^2 - x(y + 1) + y = 0.$\n\nStep 5: We look at this step and realize we're trying to use the quadratic formula, however this will not get us any useful results. We will now start exploring the inequality of $y = f(x) = \\frac{x}{x^2+x+1}$ where $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and find the range.\n\nStep 6: Rewriting $y = \\frac{x}{x^2+x+1}$ to $yx^2+xy+ y = x.$ Or more specifically-\n\n$y(x(x+1) + 1) = x$\n\n$yx^2 + xy + y = x$\n\n\nTerminating the process here, now let us consider the given function as - \n\n$f(x) = \\frac{x}{x^2+x+1}$\n\n\nOkay I agree with you, we should keep it below this point.\n\n\n\nNow we start considering how to proceed with finding the range of the function. Let's analyze the denominator, which is a parabola that opens upwards. We are trying to consider the values y as we let x vary over all real numbers.\n \nThis may lead us to the right path, let's analyze the discriminant of the quadratic $y(x^2 + x +1) = x.$\n\nThe discriminant is $b^2 - 4ac$ which is equal to $(1)^2 - 4(1)(1) = -3.$ Since this is negative, the quadratic does not intersect the $x$-axis.\n\nThe absence of $x$-intercepts of $y(x^2+x+1)-x$ suggests that for $y$ to be real, the function $y(x^2+x+1) = x$ must be one-to-one.\n\nThis conditions for $y(x^2+x+1) = x$ being one-to-one for any $y$ gives us the required range.\n\nBecause $x^2+x+1$ is always greater than 0, we have that $y(x^2+x+1)$ will be greater than $0$ whenever $y$ is greater than 0.\n\nThe zero values of $x^2 + x + 1$ never occur, the $y(x^2+x+1) = x$ when $y$ is greater than $0$ is just a horizontal one-to-one function.\n\nSince the quadratic $y(x^2 + x +1) = x$ is a one-to-one function, for any real value of $x$ the range of $f(x)$ is given by:\n\n$\\boxed{(-\\infty,0)} \\cup (0,\\infty)$",

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 2. \n\nThe reason is that Solution 2 provides a clear and concise explanation of how to find the range of the function, and it uses a more efficient approach to solve the problem.

  "solution": "Let $y$ be a number in the range of $f.$ This means that there is a real number $x$ such that \\[y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}.\\]Multiplying both sides by $x^2-x+1$ and rearranging, we get the equation \\[yx^2-(y+1)x+y=0.\\]Since $x^2-x+1 = (x-\\tfrac12)^2 + \\tfrac34 > 0$ for all $x,$ our steps are reversible, so $y$ is in the range of $f$ if and only if this equation has a real solution for $x.$ In turn, this equation has a real solution for $x$ if and only if the discriminant of this quadratic is nonnegative. Therefore, the range of $f$ consists exactly of the values of $y$ which satisfy \\[(y+1)^2 - 4y^2 \\ge 0,\\]or \\[0 \\ge 3y^2 - 2y - 1.\\]This quadratic factors as \\[0 \\ge (3y+1)(y-1),\\]which means that the solutions to the inequality are given by $-\\tfrac13 \\le y \\le 1.$ Therefore, the range of $g$ is the closed interval $\\boxed{[-\\tfrac13, 1]}.$",
