    "The problem provides a sequence defined by the rule $a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n|$ for $n\\geq1$. To find the number of different possible values of $a_2$, we will use the given constraints: $a_1 = 999$, $a_2 < 999$, and $a_{2006} = 1$.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given rule as:\n$$|a_{n+1}-a_n| = a_{n+2}$$\n\nSince $a_{2006} = 1$, we have:\n$$a_{2004} = a_{2005} + 1$$\nGiven $2004 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 167$; if  a number $X$ is such that: $a_1$, $a_2$ and $a_3$ all equal $X$, then $a_4$ must be equal to $(X-X) = 0$, then $a_5 = |a_4 - a_3| = |0 - X| = X$ and then $a_6$ must equal $(a_5 - a_4) = (X - 0)$.\n\nNow, it can be observed, if we have $a_{n}$ = $a_{n-1}$ then we're also going to have $a_{n+2}$ = $a_n$ as the formula $|a_{n+1}-a_n|$ will always evaluate to zero. In this path $a_5$ = $a_3$  or $X$ and $a_6$ = $a_4$ which follows if $X = 0$. \n\nThus we have an odd number for the exponent of a sequence value ($a_n$) result. This occurred because it was equal to the first such odd multiple in sequence terms (es multiples being [3, 5,  ...] for first $n$ such terms have $a_1$,  $a_2$, $ a_3$ = X.). Those means there is a relationship occurring here that also satisfies the required a formula definition; \n**The only time a exponent of ($2 \\times$ any power) can be considered is when regular pattern is occurring such that this corresponds with n also meaning also exists an even exponent (here trips higher power = even)?**\n\nYou need to have an even number for every multiple of exponent $2$  to this formula. While considering boundary conditions will exist since $a_1$ = $X$, all exponents of an even multiple = $n$ here determines this must occur when finding values for odd ones here \n ]\nHere would have been resulting: $X = 0$. Doing analysis of two next terms that turns the value of $a_5$ = $X$ such that both will now $1$; It must be at least if this existed then $(a_6 = |a_5 - a_4|)$ = $(a_1-a_1)$ =  $|X = X|$  = $0$  - Both $a_3$ $a_6$ then equal to 0 \n Exponent will vary. Hence a lookup ($n \\: n - 2$ ) is a standard between $X$ and the regular pattern.\n\n\n\nNow we will understand that this corresponds with n\nIf exponent of even multiple of 2 then trips higher power = even\nNow it will correspond to n = 2004 and for even n we have exponent of 2 for this case  \nThen let's analyze few points \nLet's analyze few point \n\nThis means that the maximum value of $a_2$ is 998. However, we need to find how many values are possible for $a_2$. \n\nNotice that the sequence will decrease until the $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$ have the same remainder modulo 998. Once this happens, no matter what $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$ are, $a_{n+2}$ will be at most 997.\n\nAlso note the following: \n\n$a_1 = 999$\n\n$a_2 < 999$\n\n$a_{2006} = 1$\n\nIf $(a_1, a_2)$ it\u2019s  $x$, $x$ =  $(a_1 + a_2) / 2$   and $(x \\mod k)$  also has means $[(a_1 + a_2) / 2] \\mod 998$ , be a divisor of  ($a_1 - a_2$). Our b is reduced at $b \\xrightarrow {a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n}\\xrightarrow{ assists}$ $(c)$ =  $[|a_{c+1} - a_c|]$.\n\n\n\nNow let\u2019s say a divisor of b \n**d**.\n\nSome important things: \n\n$$a_1 - a_2  =  998 d$$\n\nWith values of n\nIf it was that for even values of n \nNamely g. assists leads to \n\n$$a_{g+1} = a_{g+2} =  0.$$  \nThen let's analyze few points \n\n998 = $a_1 - a_2$\n\n\n\nFirst, let's analyze how many possible values for $a_2$ are there. That means $(a_1,a_2)$ would have d = $(a_1 - a_2)/ 998$.\n\nAs we want $x$ =  $(a_1 + a_2) / 2$ = ${|a_n - a_{1}|}/{2}$ as $(a_1 + a_2 ) $/ $ \n2 = (a_2 - a_1) + a_1$, and so $(a_2 - a_1)/ 2$ = $(|a_1 - a_2|)/2$ since $(a_1 - a_2)$ and $(a_1 + a_2)$  both divisible by 2.\n\n**[$x$ is always even $.]**\n\nIt follows $(x \\mod k)$ also equals  $[(a_1 + a_2)/ 2] \\mod 998$ which also would be equal 0\n\nThis allows $x$ to  also uniformly distributed, where $(a_1,a_2)$ is and is as well of\n    \nas modular arithmetic ! that also  only involve  two other variables value  \n[b is reduced to $(c)$ for b 900 e is b)\n\nSo  \n$$a_{n+2} = |a_{n+1}-a_n| $$ =  $ [ (a_1 - a_2) ] / 998$$\n\nAM either {-998} be a divisor of ($a_1 - a_2$) - Both [profit (a3 regular)..\n\n\n\nBoth $a_3$ and $a_6$ have 0 value. \nNamely higher power = even assists for $(c)$ be means ($n \\: n- 2$) {-2003 means ($a_1,a_3$,$ a_6) {-2003} be divisor of ($a_1 - a_2$) - means variable is both reduced at $b$ and regular pattern.\n\n\n\nBoth $a_1$ an $a_2$\n\n$$x \\in {0,1,2,..., 998} {-2003 $$ =  $\\boxed{499}.$"

  "solution": "The condition $a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n|$ implies that $a_n$ and $a_{n+3}$ have the same parity for all $n\\geq 1$. Because $a_{2006}$ is odd, $a_2$ is also odd.  Because $a_{2006}=1$ and $a_n$ is a multiple of $\\gcd(a_1,a_2)$ for all $n$, it follows that $1=\\gcd(a_1,a_2)=\\gcd(3^3\\cdot 37,a_2)$. There are 499 odd integers in the interval $[1,998]$, of which 166 are multiples of 3, 13 are multiples of 37, and 4 are multiples of $3\\cdot 37=111$. By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the number of possible values of $a_2$ cannot exceed $499-166-13+4=\\boxed{324}$.\n\nTo see that there are actually 324 possibilities, note that for $n\\geq 3$, $a_n<\\max(a_{n-2},a_{n-1})$ whenever $a_{n-2}$ and $a_{n-1}$ are both positive.  Thus $a_N=0$ for some $N\\leq 1999$. If $\\gcd(a_1,a_2)=1$, then $a_{N-2}=a_{N-1}=1$, and for $n>N$ the sequence cycles through the values 1, 1, 0.  If in addition $a_2$ is odd, then $a_{3k+2}$ is odd for $k\\geq 1$, so $a_{2006}=1$.",
