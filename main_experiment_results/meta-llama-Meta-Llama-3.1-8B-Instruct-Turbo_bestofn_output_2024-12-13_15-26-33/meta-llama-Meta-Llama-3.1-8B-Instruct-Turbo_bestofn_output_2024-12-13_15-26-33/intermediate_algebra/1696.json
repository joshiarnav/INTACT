    "To find $|z|$, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. We're given that $z^2 = 24-32i$. First, we need to find the magnitude of $z^2$, denoted as $|z^2|$. We know that $|z^2| = |24-32i|$. \n\n2. The magnitude of a complex number is given by the formula $|a+bi| = \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the real and imaginary parts, respectively. Applying this to the complex number $24-32i$:\n\n   $|24-32i| = \\sqrt{24^2 + (-32)^2}$\n\n3. Simplify the expression inside the square root:\n\n   $|24-32i| = \\sqrt{576 + 1024}$\n\n   $|24-32i| = \\sqrt{1600}$\n\n4. Now, find the square root of 1600:\n\n   $|24-32i| = 40$\n\n5. Recall that $|z^2| = 40$. The magnitude of a complex number is always non-negative, and the magnitude of $z^2$ is the square of the magnitude of $z$. Hence, $|z^2| = |z|^2$.\n\n6. Equate the magnitudes:\n\n   $40 = |z|^2$\n\n7. To find $|z|$, take the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\n   $|z| = \\sqrt{40}$\n\n8. Simplify the square root of 40:\n\n   $|z| = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 10}$\n\n   $|z| = \\sqrt{4} \\cdot \\sqrt{10}$\n\n   $|z| = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{10}$\n\n9. Thus, we have found the magnitude of the complex number $z$: $|z| = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{10}.}$"
