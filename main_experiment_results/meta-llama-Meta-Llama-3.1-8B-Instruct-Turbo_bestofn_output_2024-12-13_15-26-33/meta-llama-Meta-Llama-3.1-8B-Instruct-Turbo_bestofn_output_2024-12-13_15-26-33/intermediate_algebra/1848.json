    "To find the value of $b$ given that $2 + \\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the equation, we'll follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Since $a$ and $b$ are rational numbers, if $2 + \\sqrt{3}$ is a root, then so is $2 - \\sqrt{3}$. This is because if a polynomial equation has rational coefficients, and $a + \\sqrt{b}$ is a root, then $a - \\sqrt{b}$ is also a root. This property comes from the conjugate root theorem.\n\nStep 2: Now that we know both $2 + \\sqrt{3}$ and $2 - \\sqrt{3}$ are roots of the equation, let's form the quadratic equation whose roots are these two numbers. This quadratic will be obtained from the form $(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are roots. Let's denote $2 + \\sqrt{3}$ as $r_1$ and $2 - \\sqrt{3}$ as $r_2$.\n\nSo, the quadratic will be: $(x - (2 + \\sqrt{3}))(x - (2 - \\sqrt{3})) = 0$. Notice that this simplifies to: $((x - 2) - \\sqrt{3})((x - 2) + \\sqrt{3})$.\n\nMultiplying the expression, we get: $(x - 2)^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 - 3 = x^2 - 4x + 1$.\n\nStep 3: This quadratic equation $x^2 - 4x + 1$ represents the quadratic polynomial with roots $2 + \\sqrt{3}$ and $2 - \\sqrt{3}$. Since this quadratic equation is a factor of the original cubic equation $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10$, let's use polynomial division to represent it.\n\nAfter dividing $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10$ by $x^2 - 4x + 1$, we should get the quotient $x + (a + 4)$. This quotient tells us the extent to which the first two monomials of the cubic polynomial $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10$ must be adjusted through the given roots. The cubic polynomial equation can then be written as: $(x^2 - 4x + 1)(x + (a + 4)) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10$.\n\nStep 4: Next, we expand the equation $(x^2 - 4x + 1)(x + (a + 4)) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10$ to relate the coefficients of the two polynomials and solve for the coefficient $b$. This expanded form is represented as: $x^3 + (a + 4 - 4)x^2 + (1 - 4a - 4)x + 1(a + 4) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10$.\n\nSimplifying and comparing the coefficients of like powers of the terms on both sides, we get: \n$b = - 4a - 7$\nWe also need the constant term, which is 1(a + 4) = 10 as well. Using this information, let's solve for $a$. \n\nWe have the following two equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n-4a-7 &= b\\\\\na + 4 &= 10\n\\end{align*}\nWe can solve for a from the second equation by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:\n$a = 6$\n\n\nStep 5: Now we can solve for $b$ using the equation we obtained from both sides, where $a$ is replaced with its value of 6 from the previous step. Substituting the value $a$ in the expression for $b$ yields $b = -4a-7$, which will give the value of b as $b = -4(6)-7$.\n\nSolving the expression, we get: $-24 - 7 = b$\nThus, $b = - 31$.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{-31}$.",
    "To find the value of $b,$ we can use the fact that if $2 + \\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the equation, then so is $2 - \\sqrt{3}.$ \n\nStep 1:  First, let's identify the roots and the equation. We know that one of the roots is a complex conjugate pair: $2+\\sqrt{3}$ and $2-\\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 2:  Given the equation \\[x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10 = 0\\], the sum of the roots is $-a$ and the product of the roots taken two at a time is $b.$\nStep 3:  We know the sum of the conjugate pair of roots  $(2+\\sqrt{3}) + (2-\\sqrt{3})=4.$ Since there is a third root, let's call it $r,$ the total sum of all 3 roots will be the coefficient of the $x^2$ term with a minus sign: $r + (2+\\sqrt{3}) + (2-\\sqrt{3}) = -a.$ From here, it can be deduced that $r + 4=-a$\nStep 4:  Since $r$ is  a root of the given equation, it must satisfy the equation. Thus we can substitute $r$, $(2+\\sqrt{3})$ and $(2-\\sqrt{3})$ into the equation.\nStep 5:  First, let's multiply the equation by necessary values so that 2, 3, and 10 will be the coefficients of the $x^3$ term, the $x$ term, and the constant term respectively. Once we've done that, we can substitute our root values into the equation.\nStep 6:  Knowing the sum and the product of the conjugate pair, we can deduce the coefficient of the $x^3$ term by realizing the third term will provide root $r$, thereby yielding an equation of the form $x^3-rx^2+\\big((2+\\sqrt{3})+(2-\\sqrt{3})\\big)x - (2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3})x^0=0$ \nStep 7:  On simplifying this equation we get $x^3-rx^2+4x-10=0$ \nStep 8:  So, equating the coefficients, we get the following equations:\nStep 9:  Equating $4$ of the $x^2$ term of the equation gives us the equation $r = -a$\nStep 10:  The constant term is $-10$, and it's equal to $-(2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3})$ which simplifies to $-10$. When it's multiplied by 1, it's just equal to $-10$ and because $10$ is given to be the constant term on the original equation, the constant term in this new equation is correct.\nStep 11:  Equating the coefficient of the $x$ term, we get $4 = b + (-r)(2 + \\sqrt{3}) + (-r)(2 - \\sqrt{3})$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, $b = 4 - 4(-a)$, and we know that $a=-r$. Thus, we can substitute $b = 4 + 4r$ and a=-r to find the value of b.\nStep 13:  Next, we want to determine the value of b.\nStep 14  To compute the value of $r$, we can  find the coefficient of the $x$ in a cubic equation with roots of 2, $\\sqrt{3}$, and $-\\sqrt{3}$. As the sum of the product taken two at a time can be computed using Vieta's formulas, it is written as $b=(2\\cdot \\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{3}\\cdot (-\\sqrt{3}) +(-\\sqrt{3})\\cdot 2)$.\nStep 15:  By simplifying the equation of the sum of the product taken two at a time, we can determine the value of b.\nStep 16  Now, substituting  $(2\\cdot \\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{3}\\cdot (-\\sqrt{3}) +(-\\sqrt{3})\\cdot 2)$ in  $b = 4 + 4r$, we can find the value of b.\nStep 17:  As the cubic equation is of the form $x^3-3x^2+4x-10$, it can be observed that \nStep 18:  Then, using the obtained value of $a=-(-4)$, the value of $r=4$, we can find the value of b as $4+4(-4) = 4 -16$\nStep 19:  Finally, simplifying $b=4-16=-12$ \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-12}$",
    "To find the value of b, we will use the properties of polynomial roots and the conjugate root theorem.\n\nStep 1: The conjugate root theorem states that if a polynomial equation has rational coefficients and $x = r + s\\sqrt{d}$ is a root, then $x = r - s\\sqrt{d}$ is also a root of the polynomial equation.\n\nStep 2: Given that $2+\\sqrt{3}$ is a root, the conjugate $2 - \\sqrt{3}$ must also be a root of the equation $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10 = 0$.\n\nStep 3: Since the coefficients a and b are rational, we can apply Vieta's formulas to find the product of roots of the cubic equation $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10 = 0$.\n\nStep 4: Vieta's formulas state that for a cubic equation $x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0$, the product of the roots is given by $-\\frac{r}{1} = -r$. In our case, the product of the roots is $-10$.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, $ (2+\\sqrt{3})(2 - \\sqrt{3})(r_3) = -10 $  where  $ r_3 $  is the third root of the polynomial equation.\n\nStep 6:  We can simplify $(2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3}) = 4-3 = 1$. So the product of the roots becomes $1 \\times r_3 = -10$. Thus  the third root is $r_3 = -10$.\n\nStep 7:  The sum of the roots of the cubic equation $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10 = 0$ can be computed using Vieta's formulas. The sum of the roots is given by $-\\frac{p}{1} = -p$. \n\nStep 8:  The sum of the roots $(2+\\sqrt{3}) + (2-\\sqrt{3}) + (-10) = -8$. This implies that  $-(a) = -8$.\n\nStep 9:  From step 8, we know that $a = 8$. Now let's calculate the value of b.\n\nStep 10:  Using Vieta's formulas, the sum of the pairwise products of the roots is given by $-\\frac{q}{1} = -q$. \n\nStep 11:  Therefore, $ (2+\\sqrt{3})(2 - \\sqrt{3}) + (2+\\sqrt{3})(-10) + (2-\\sqrt{3})(-10) = -b$.\n\nStep 12:  From Step 5, we know that $(2+\\sqrt{3})(2 - \\sqrt{3}) = 1$. \n\nStep 13:  So the equation from Step 11 reduces to $1 + (-20 -10\\sqrt{3}) + (-20+10\\sqrt{3}) = -b$\n\nStep 14:  Simplifying, we get $1 -20 - 20 = -b$, giving us  $b = 39$.\n\nStep 15: Therefore,  the value of b is $\\boxed{39}$."
