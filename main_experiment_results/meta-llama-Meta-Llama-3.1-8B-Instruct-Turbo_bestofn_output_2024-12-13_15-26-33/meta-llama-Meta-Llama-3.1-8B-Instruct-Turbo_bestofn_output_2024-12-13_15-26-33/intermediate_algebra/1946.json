    "Since the coefficients of the cubic polynomial are real numbers, the complex roots must appear in conjugate pairs.\n\nWe already know that one of the roots is $-2 - 3i.$ Therefore, the other complex root must be the conjugate of this root, which is $-2 + 3i.$\n\nLet's denote the real root of the cubic polynomial as $r.$ We can now write the cubic polynomial as\n\n\\[ax^3 + 3x^2 + bx - 65 = (x - (-2 - 3i))(x - (-2 + 3i))(x - r).\\]\n\nExpanding the product of the two quadratic expressions, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(x^2 + 4x + 13)(x - r) &= x^3 - rx^2 + 4x^2 - 4rx + 13x - 13r\\\\\n&=x^3 - rx^2 + (4 - r)x - 13r\n\\end{align*}\n\nEquate this to the given cubic polynomial expression:\n\n\\[ax^3 + 3x^2 + bx - 65 = x^3 - rx^2 + (4 - r)x - 13r\\]\n\nComparing the coefficients, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 1,\\\\\n-r &= 3,\\\\\n4 - r &= b,\\\\\n-13r &= -65.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can solve the first and last equations to get $a = 1$ and $r = 5.$\n\nThen using $r = 5$ in the equation $4 - r = b$ gives\n\n\\[b = 4 - (5) = -1.\\]\n\nTherefore, the real root of the cubic polynomial is $r = \\boxed{5}.$",
    "Since $-2 - 3i$ is a root, its complex conjugate $-2 + 3i$ must also be a root. \n\nLet $r$ be the real root of the cubic polynomial. By Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of all the roots equals $-\\frac{b}{a}$ which in this case is $-\\frac{3}{a}$, where the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is 3. However, in the Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots equals $-\\frac{b}{a}$. Here in the cubic polynomial, the coefficient of the $x^3$ term is $a$, so we can say that the sum of the roots of the polynomial is $-\\frac{3}{a}$.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\\[r + (-2 - 3i) + (-2 + 3i) = -\\frac{3}{a}\\]\n\nSince $-2 - 3i$ and $-2 + 3i$ are complex conjugates, their imaginary parts cancel out and we can simplify the equation as:\n\\[r -2 -2 = -\\frac{3}{a}\\]\n\nNow we can simplify this expression by adding $4$ to both sides of the equation:\n\\[r = -\\frac{3}{a} + 4\\]\n\nHowever, Vieta's formulas can also be used to find the product of all the roots. In this case, the product of the roots of the cubic equation is $-\\frac{65}{a}$.\n\nNow that we know two of the roots ($-2 - 3i$ and $-2 + 3i$), we can evaluate the product of these two complex roots.\n\n\\[(-2 - 3i)(-2 + 3i) = 4 + 9 = 13\\]\n\nNow, let's call this value $P$. This value represents the product of the two roots we already know. With this value of $P$, we can write the product of the roots of the cubic polynomial as:\n\\[r \\times P = -\\frac{65}{a}\\]\n\nNow, we can plug in $P = 13$ and the expression for $r$ that we found earlier to get:\n\\[(-\\frac{3}{a} + 4) \\times 13 = -\\frac{65}{a}\\]\n\nNow we can simplify this expression by multiplying $13$ by $-\\frac{3}{a}$ and $4$, giving:\n\\[-\\frac{39}{a} + 52 = -\\frac{65}{a}\\]\n\nNow, we can move all terms involving $a$ to the left side of the equation by subtracting $-\\frac{39}{a}$ from both sides, resulting in the equation:\n\\[52 = -\\frac{26}{a}\\]\n\nTo get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $a$, giving:\n\\[52a = -26\\]\n\nNow, we can solve for $a$ by dividing both sides of this equation by $52$, resulting in the equation:\n\\[a = \\frac{-26}{52} = \\frac{-1}{2}\\]\n\nSince we want the value of the real root $r$, let's go back to the equation we derived earlier, which is:\n\\[r = -\\frac{3}{a} + 4\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute $a = \\frac{-1}{2}$ into this equation to find $r$:\n\\[r = -\\frac{3}{\\frac{-1}{2}} + 4\\]\n\nWe can simplify this expression by taking the reciprocal of $\\frac{-1}{2}$ and multiplying $3$ by the result to obtain:\n\\[r = 3 \\times -2 + 4\\]\n\nNow we can simplify $r$ by evaluating the product of $3$ and $-2$, and then adding $4$ to the result:\n\\[r = -6 + 4 = -2\\]\n\nTherefore, the real root of the cubic polynomial is $\\boxed{-2}$."
