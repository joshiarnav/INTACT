    "To solve the given equation \\[\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + \\sqrt{x - 1} = 1\\], let's consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Define a variable substitution** to simplify the expressions:\n   Let $u = \\sqrt[3]{2 - x}$. This implies that $u^3 = 2 - x$.\n\n2. **Express x in terms of u**:\n   By the definition of u, we have $u^3 = 2 - x$. Thus, $x = 2 - u^3$.\n\n3. **Express the other square root in terms of u**:\n   The other square root in the equation is $\\sqrt{x - 1} = \\sqrt{(2 - u^3) - 1} = \\sqrt{1 - u^3}$.\n\n4. **Substitute into the original equation**:\n   Substituting into the original equation gives us:\n   \\[u + \\sqrt{1 - u^3} = 1.\\]\n\n5. **Solve for u:**\n   To solve the equation, we first isolate $\\sqrt{1 - u^3}$:\n   $\\sqrt{1 - u^3} = 1 - u$, by rearranging it, we get $(1 - u)^2 = 1 - u^3$, and it then simplifies to $0 = 1 - u^3 - 2u + u^2$. This can be rewritten as \\[u^2 - u^3 + u - 1 = 0\\], by rearranging it, it can be factored as \\[-(u-1)(u^2-u+1) = 0\\].\n\n   **Note: Since we have u = 1 \\[1 = \\sqrt[3]{2 - x}\\] from the initial problem, this would give -1; hence this value is not a solution.**\n\n  Hence, the other solutions are obtained from \\[u^2 - u^3 + u - 1 = 0\\]. This equation can also be written as\n  \\[u^2-u(1+3)+1=0,\\] \n  which is equivalent to\n  \\[u^2-4u+1=0\\], \n  or \\[(u-2)^2-9=0.\\]\n\nThus $u = 2 \\pm 3,$ so $u = 5$ or $u = -1$.\n\nWe cannot have $u = -1,$ because $\\sqrt[3]{2-x} \\ge -1$ for all $x.$ We cannot have $\\sqrt[3]{2-x} = 5,$ because $2 - x \\le 0$ for all $x$ except $2$. It is given that $\\sqrt[3]{2-x}$ is real, so we conclude that $u$ must be between $-1$ and $1$, but note that it cannot actually be $0$. \n\nFinally, \\[u = \\sqrt[3]{2 - x}\\] therefore, it is possible to write that \\[0 = \\sqrt[3]{2-x},\\] so that  \\[x = 2,\\] must be between $-1$ and $1$. This value of $u$ can only be valid if $x \\neq 2$. \n\nThese are all solutions to the original equation.\n\n$\\boxed{4,-2,2}$",
    "To solve the given equation, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Let's start by isolating one of the radical terms on one side of the equation: \n\n\\[\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} = 1 - \\sqrt{x - 1}.\\]\n\n2. Now, cube both sides of the equation to remove one of the radicals. We get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(1 - \\sqrt{x - 1})^3 & = 1.\n\\end{align*}\n\nExpanding this will help us move closer to isolating the square root term.\n\n3. Using the binomial expansion (or expanding manually), we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(1 - \\sqrt{x - 1})^3 & = 1 - 3\\sqrt{x - 1} + 3(x - 1) - (x - 1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nDiscarding the term involving the expression $- (x - 1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}$ as it will act as another radical that we can't remove yet (Plugging this term back into the expression could also result in the complete absorption of the term) and simplifying the remaining equation, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n1 - 3\\sqrt{x - 1} + 3(x - 1) & = 1 \\\\\n- 3\\sqrt{x - 1} + 3(x - 1) & = 0.\n\\end{align*}\n\n4. Rearranging the equation to isolate the square root term completely, we get:\n\n\\[\\sqrt{x - 1} = 3 - 3x.\\]\n\n5. We can square both sides of this equation to remove the square root. However, before squaring the equation, notice that squaring the equation will result in absorption of the -3x side of the equation with an additional complex of this side and an original side of the expression equating to a total multiple of three at the right side of the equation. Here was the equation we were considering for right before squaring it:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left(\\sqrt{x - 1}\\right)^2 & = \\left(3 - 3x\\right)^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad\\qquad x - 1  & =  9 - 18x + 9x^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad\\qquad 9x^2 - 18x - 8 & = 0.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it for x using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.\\]\n\nSubstituting a = 9, b = -18, and c = -8, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx & = \\frac{-(-18) \\pm \\sqrt{(-18)^2 - 4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot (-8)}}{2 \\cdot 9}\\\\\n& = \\frac{18 \\pm \\sqrt{324 + 288}}{18}\\\\\n& = \\frac{18 \\pm \\sqrt{612}}{18}\\\\\n& = \\frac{18 \\pm 24.68}{18}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow we have two solutions for x, but we need to make sure they are real and make sense in the context of the original equation. We can go back to the equation \\(\\sqrt{x - 1} = 3 - 3x\\) and square it, however, the equation \\(\\sqrt{x - 1}\\) must be at least greater than or equal to 0 because you may not take the square root of a negative number. Our equation of this has to be in the form of $a^2 = a^2$ where a is a value greater than, equal to or less than 0. Since \\(\\sqrt{x - 1} = 3-3x\\) must be greater than or equal to zero, then \\(-3x \\geq -3\\pm \\sqrt{ 612}\\), because 3-3x must be greater than, equal to or less than zero. We isolate x here to see if both the values of x we obtained give us valid solutions for the original equation:\n\n\\[ -x \\geq -1\u00b1 \\frac{\\sqrt{ 612 }}{3}\\\\/ \\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x \\leq  1\\pm  \\frac{\\sqrt{612}}{3}.\\]\n\nThe original equation also requires \\(\\sqrt[3]{2-x} \\geq 0\\) has a lower limit of -2 and an upper limit of infinity, whereas a overall lower limit of -2 and an upper limit of infinity adheres to the terms and this may, or may not make either the solutions -1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{612}}{3} and -1- \\frac{\\sqrt{612}}{3} be potential solutions.
