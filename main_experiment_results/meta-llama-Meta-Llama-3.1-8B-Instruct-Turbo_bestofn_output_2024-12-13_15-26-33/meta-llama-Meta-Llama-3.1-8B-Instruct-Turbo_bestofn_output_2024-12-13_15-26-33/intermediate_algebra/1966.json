    "To find the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$ given that $a_1 = 1$ and $a_1, a_2, a_3$ is a geometric sequence, we need to express $a_2$ and $a_3$ in terms of a common ratio and then work from there.\n\nSince the sequence is geometric, we have:\n\n$a_2 = a_1r$ \n\nand \n\n$a_3 = a_1r^2$\n\nwhere $r$ is the common ratio. Given that $a_1 = 1$, we can write:\n\n$a_2 = r$\n\nand\n\n$a_3 = r^2$\n\nThe expression $4a_2 + 5a_3$ becomes:\n\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2$\n\nNow we can consider this as a quadratic expression in $r$. To find its minimum, we need to find its vertex.\n\nLet's consider the expression in the form of $f(r) = 5r^2 + 4r$. We know that the vertex of a quadratic function in the form $f(r) = ar^2 + br + c$ is located at $r = -\\frac{b}{2a}$.\n\nApplying this formula to our function, we get:\n\n$-\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{4}{2(5)} = -\\frac{2}{5}$\n\nSo, the minimum of the quadratic expression will occur at $r = -\\frac{2}{5}$. We can substitute this value into the expression $4r + 5r^2$ to find its minimum value:\n\n$4 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right) + 5 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2$\n\n$= -\\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{4}{5}$\n\n$= -\\frac{4}{5}$\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}}$.",

To do this, we can take the derivative of this expression with respect to $r$ and set it equal to zero.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the expression as $f(r) = 5r^2 + 4r$.\n\nTaking the derivative of $f(r)$ with respect to $r$, we get:\n$f'(r) = d(5r^2 + 4r)/dr = 10r + 4$\n\nNow, setting $f'(r) = 0$ and solving for $r$, we have:\n$10r + 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow r = \\frac{-4}{10} = \\frac{-2}{5}$\n\nTo find the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$, we substitute this value of $r$ into the expression:\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2 = 4(\\frac{-2}{5}) + 5(\\frac{-2}{5})^2$ \n$ = \\frac{-8}{5} + 5(\\frac{4}{25}) = \\frac{-8}{5} + \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{-4}{5}$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}}$.",
    "To find the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3,$ we first note that the sequence is geometric. Let's denote the common ratio as $r$. This means that $a_2 = a_1r$ and $a_3 = a_1r^2.$\n\nWe are given that $a_1 = 1.$ Thus, we can rewrite the expression $4a_2 + 5a_3$ as:\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4(1)r + 5(1)r^2$\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2$\n\nTo find the minimum value of this expression, we can complete the square or find the vertex of the parabola represented by $4r + 5r^2$. \n\nThe standard form for a parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ has its vertex at $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. If we rearrange the equation $4r + 5r^2$ into the standard form, we have: \n$y = 5r^2 + 4r$\n\nUsing $r$ as the variable ($x$ in the equation), the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex becomes:\n$x = -\\frac{4}{2(5)}$\n$x = -\\frac{2}{5}$\n\nSince $x = -\\frac{2}{5}$, then $r = -\\frac{2}{5}$\n\nWe now substitute this value back into the equation:\n$4r + 5r^2 = 4(-\\frac{2}{5}) + 5(-\\frac{2}{5})^2$\n$4r + 5r^2 = -\\frac{8}{5} + 5(\\frac{4}{25})$\n$4r + 5r^2 = -\\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{4}{5}$\n$4r + 5r^2 = \\frac{-8 + 4}{5}$\n$4r + 5r^2 = -\\frac{4}{5}$\n\nThus, the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}}$."
