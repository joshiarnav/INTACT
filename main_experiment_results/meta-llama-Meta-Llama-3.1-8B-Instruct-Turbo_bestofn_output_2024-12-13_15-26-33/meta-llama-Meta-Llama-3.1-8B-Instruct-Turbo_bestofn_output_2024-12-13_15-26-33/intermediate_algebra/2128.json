    "Since the foci of the hyperbola have the same $x-$coordinate, it must be a horizontal hyperbola. The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the segment connecting the two foci. \n\nSince the foci have the same $x-$coordinate of $5,$ the center of the hyperbola must also have an $x-$coordinate of $5.$ \n\nThe asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at its center.  Since one of the asymptotes has equation $y=3x$, plugging in $x=5$ gives us that the center lies on the line $y=15.$\n\nNow we need to write the equation of the other asymptote.  The standard equation of a horizontal hyperbola is given by \n\n$$\\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2}-\\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2}=1$$\n\nwhere $(h,k)$ is the center. Here $h=5$ and $k=15.$ However, we don't have  $a$ and $b$. So let's find the slope of the other asymptote, and then we can find its equation.\n\nSince the given asymptote is $y=3x$, the other asymptote must be of the form $y=mx$, where $m=-3$.  To find the equation of the other asymptote, we need to find the value of $b$.\n\nSince the two asymptotes intersect at $(h,k)=(5,15)$, we can plug these values into the equation $y=mx+b$ to get \n\n$$15=5m+b$$Replacing $m=-3$ into the equation,  we get\n\n$$15=5(-3)+b\\rightarrow15=-15+b\\rightarrow b=30$$\n\nNow we need to write the equation of the other asymptote in the form \"$y = mx + b$\". We already found that $m=-3$ and $b=30$. \n\nSo the equation of the other asymptote is $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}$.",
    "Step 1: The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the line segment joining the two foci.

    "Step 1:  We are given that one of the asymptotes of the hyperbola has the equation $y = 3x.$ Since the foci of the hyperbola have the same $x-$coordinate, which is $5,$ the center of the hyperbola must also lie on this vertical line.\nStep 2:  As the center lies on the line $x=5$ and it is also on the line $y=3x$, plugging $x=5$ in $y=3x,$ gives us $y=3*5=15.$\nStep 3:  The asymptotes of the hyperbola make equal angles with the transverse axis. Since the given asymptote $y=3x$ makes an angle of $45^\\circ$ (or $\\tan^{-1}(3)$) with the transverse axis, the other asymptote will make a $135^\\circ$ angle with the transverse axis.\nStep 4:  The slopes of the other asymptote can be calculated using the tangent of the angle $135^\\circ$. The negative reciprocal of $3$ is $-\\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 5:  Using the point-slope formula, $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope of the line, we can write the equation of the other asymptote.\nStep 6:  Plugging in the slope $-\\frac{1}{3}$, and the point $(5, 15)$ into the point-slope formula, we get: \n\\[y - 15 = -\\frac{1}{3} (x - 5).\\]\nStep 7:  Multiplying both sides by $3$, we get $3y - 45 = -x + 5$, then, $3y +x = 50$. To find the correct answer in the format $y=mx+b,$ rearranging and setting it in formula format, we get $\\boxed{y=-\\frac{1}{3}x+\\frac{55}{3}}$"

  "solution": "Because the foci both lie on the line $x=5$ and the center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the segment connecting the foci, the center must also lie on the line $x=5.$ However, we also know that the asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at the center. Therefore, the center of the hyperbola lies on both the line $x=5$ and the line $y=3x,$ so its coordinates are $(5, 15).$\n\nBecause the hyperbola has a horizontal axis, the other asymptote must have slope $-3.$ Therefore, we can write a point-slope equation for the other asymptote: \\[y - 15 = -3(x - 5),\\]which is equivalent to $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}.$",
