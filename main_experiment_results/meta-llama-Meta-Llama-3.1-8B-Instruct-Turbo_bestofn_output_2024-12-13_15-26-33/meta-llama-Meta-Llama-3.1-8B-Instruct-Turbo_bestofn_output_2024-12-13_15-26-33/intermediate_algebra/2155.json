    "To find the distance between the foci of the given ellipse, we'll first need to convert the given equation into the standard form of an ellipse. \n\nThe given equation is: \n\\[\\begin{align*} \n16x^2 - 64x + y^2 + 4y + 4 &= 0 \\\\\n16(x^2 - 4x) + (y^2 + 4y) &= -4 \\\\\n16(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 + 4y + 4) &= -4 + 64 + 4 \\\\\n16(x - 2)^2 + (y + 2)^2 &= 64 \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nNow, let's rewrite the equation as:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{16(x-2)^2}{64} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{64} &= 1 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{(x-2)^2}{4} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{64} &= 1 \\ \\ \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nComparing this with the standard form of an ellipse $\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1,$ we have:\n\n$a^2 = 4$ and $b^2 = 64.$ \n\nSince $a^2 < b^2,$ the major axis lies along the y-axis. \n\nThe formula for the distance between the foci in an ellipse is $2\\sqrt{b^2 - a^2}.$ \n\nSo, substituting the values, we get:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n2\\sqrt{b^2 - a^2} &= 2\\sqrt{64 - 4} \\\\\n&= 2\\sqrt{60} \\\\\n&= 2\\sqrt{4 \\cdot 15} \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot 2 \\sqrt{15} \\\\\n&= \\boxed{4\\sqrt{15}} \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nSo, the distance between the foci is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{15}}$.",
    "To find the distance between the foci of the given ellipse, we need to complete the square for both x and y terms in the equation. \n\nFirst, rewrite the given equation:\n\n$16x^2 - 64x + y^2 + 4y + 4 = 0$\n\nNow, group the x and y terms:\n\n$16(x^2 - 4x) + (y^2 + 4y) = -4$\n\nTo complete the square, we add $(4/2)^2 = 4$ inside the parentheses with x and $(2/2)^2 = 1$ inside the parentheses with y:\n\n$16(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 + 4y + 4) = -4 + 64 + 4$\n\nThis simplifies to: \n\n$16(x - 2)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 64$\n\nDivide everything by 64:\n\n$\\frac{(y+2)^2}{64} + \\frac{(x-2)^2}{4} = 1$\n\nThis is the standard form of an ellipse.

    "To find the distance between the foci of the given ellipse, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Complete the square for both x and y**: \n   \\[16x^2 - 64x + y^2 + 4y + 4 = 0\\]\n   \\[16(x^2 - 4x) + (y^2 + 4y) = -4\\]\n   Let's complete the square for x and y separately: \n   \\[16((x - 2)^2 - 4) + (y^2 + 4y) = -4\\]\n   Since $16 \\cdot 4 = 64$ and we substitute $-4$ with $-4 \\cdot 16$:\n   \\[16((x - 2)^2 - \\frac{4}{16}) + (y^2 + 4y) = -4\\]\n   The squared constant of x is then $\\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}$, and we get:\n   \\[16((x - 2)^2 - \\frac{1}{4}) + (y^2 + 4y) = -4\\]\n   And now distribute the $16$ to $(x - 2)^2$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ in the equation given:\n   \\[16(x - 2)^2 - 4 + (y^2 + 4y) = -4\\]\n   This leads to, for both like terms, $-4$ on the left side getting eliminated by combining the constants:\n   \\[16(x - 2)^2 + (y^2 + 4y) = 0\\]\n   And the first step is to complete the square of $y$: \n   \\[y^2 + 4y = (y + \\frac{4}{2})^2 - (\\frac{4}{2})^2\\]\n   Which is equivalent to: \n   \\[y^2 + 4y = (y + 2)^2 - 4\\]\n   Substituting back the (y) equation, it would then become:\n   \\[16(x - 2)^2 + (y + 2)^2 - 4 = 0\\]\n   After rearranging the terms and adding $4$ to both sides, this leads to: \n   \\[16(x - 2)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 4\\]\n   Divide both sides by $4$ so that we are dividing by a number that can simplify $4$, giving: \n   \\[4(x - 2)^2 + (y + 2)^2/4 = 1\\]\n   Since The formula is squared for $(y + 2)^2/4$ then we should multiply $(y + 2)$ by $\\sqrt{4}$ which will result in\n   \\[\\frac{(y+2)^2}{4}=(\\frac{y+2}{\\sqrt{4}})^2\\]\n   And we have $\\frac{y+2}{\\sqrt{4}}=\\frac{y+2}{2}$, therefore $a=2$, $h = -2$ and $k = 2$.\n\n2. **Find $a^2$ and $b^2$**: \n   In the equation, $a^2 = 4$, $h = -2$ and $k = 2$.\n\n3. **Find $b^2$**:\n   In the given equation, $b^2 = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$.\n\n4. **Find $c^2$**:\n   Since we already know that $a^2 = 4$ and $b^2 = 1$, we can find $c^2$ using the formula: \n   \\[c^2 = a^2 - b^2\\]\n   which is equivalent to: \n   \\[c^2 = 4 - 1 = 3\\]\n   Therefore, $c = \\sqrt 3$.\n\n5. **Find the distance between the foci**:\n   The distance between the foci of an ellipse is given by: \n   \\[2c\\]\n   We already calculated that $c = \\sqrt 3$, so the distance between the foci is:\n   \\[2c = 2\\sqrt{3}\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{3}}$"
