    "To find the slant asymptote of the rational expression, we will divide the numerator by the denominator using polynomial long division or synthetic division. \n\nPolynomial long division:\n1. Divide the leading term of the numerator (2x^2) by the leading term of the denominator (x), which gives us 2x.\n2. Multiply the entire denominator by 2x, which gives us 2x^2 - 6x.\n3. Subtract the result (2x^2 - 6x) from the numerator (2x^2 + 3x - 7), which gives us 9x - 7.\n4. Now we divide the new leading term (9x) by the leading term of the denominator (x), which gives us 9.\n5. Multiply the entire denominator by 9, which gives us 9x - 27. \n6. Subtract the result (9x - 27) from the new numerator (9x - 7), which gives us 20.\n\nThe polynomial division is of the form:\n \n   2x\n   ___________________\n   2x^2 + 3x  - 7\n   - (2x^2 - 6x)\n   ___________________\n          9x - 7\n   -  (9x - 27)\n  ___________________\n           20\n\nCombining the results, we get:\ny = 2x + 9 + (20/(x - 3))\n\nHowever for slant asymptote we are only interested in terms of x.\n\nSo the slant asymptote of the given rational expression is y = 2x + 9.\nComparing this with the form y = mx + b, we can see that m = 2 and b = 9.\nTherefore, m + b = 2 + 9 = 11\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{11}$.",

    "To find the slant asymptote of the rational expression, we can divide the numerator by the denominator or find the limit as $x$ approaches infinity.\n\nFirst, we'll divide the numerator by the denominator. The numerator is $2x^2 + 3x - 7$ and the denominator is $x - 3$. We'll use polynomial long division to divide the numerator by the denominator.\n\nHere's the polynomial long division:\n```markdown\n  __________\nx - 3 | 2x^2 + 3x - 7\n  -2x^2 + 6x __________\n  -3x - 7\n  ____________________\n     -3x + 9 \n     __________________\n      -16\n```\nNow we have $2x^2 + 3x - 7 = (x-3)(2x+9) - 16$, but we need $2x^2 + 3x - 7 = (x-3)(2x+9) + (...)$. To make it $(x-3)(2x+9) + (...) = 2x^2 + 3x - 7$, we need to make $-16 = 16$. So the new remainder becomes 16 and the expression is:  $2x^2 + 3x - 7 = (x-3)(2x+9) + 16$.\n\nThe slant asymptote is the quotient of the polynomial long division. In this case, the quotient is $x + 9$.\n\nNow that we have the slant asymptote in the form $y = mx + b$, we can find $m + b$.\n\nWe have:\n$y = mx + b$\n$m = 1$ (coefficient of $x$)\n$b = 9$ (constant term)\n$m + b = 1 + 9 = 10$\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{10}$."
