    "We are given the function $f(x) = ax^3 - 6x^2 + bx - 5$ and two remainder theorems, each with a corresponding divisor. The remainder theorem states that for a polynomial $f(x)$ and a divisor $x-c$, the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $x-c$ is $f(c)$.\n\nFor the first divisor $x-1$, we know the remainder is $-5$, so we can write the equation:\n\n$$f(1) = -5$$\n\nLet's substitute $x=1$ into the equation for $f(x)$:\n$a(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + b(1) - 5 = -5$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n$a - 6 + b - 5 = -5$\n$a + b - 11 = -5$\n\nSolving for $a + b$, we get:\n$a + b = 6$\n\nFor the second divisor $x + 2$, we know the remainder is $-53$, so we can write the equation:\n\n$$f(-2) = -53$$\n\nLet's substitute $x=-2$ into the equation for $f(x)$:\n$a(-2)^3 - 6(-2)^2 + b(-2) - 5 = -53$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n$-8a - 24 - 2b - 5 = -53$\n$-8a - 2b - 29 = -53$\n\nAdding 29 to both sides of the equation:\n$-8a - 2b = -24$\n\nWe can multiply the first equation $a + b = 6$ by 2 to get:\n$2a + 2b = 12$\n\nNow we'll subtract the second new equation $-8a - 2b = -24$ from the first one:\n$(2a + 2b) - (-8a - 2b) = 12 - (-24)$\n$2a + 2b + 8a + 2b = 36$\n$10a + 4b = 36$\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n$a + b = 6$\n$10a + 4b = 36$\n\nMultiplying the first equation $a + b = 6$ by 4 to make the coefficients of $b$ match:\n$4a + 4b = 24$\n\nNow subtract the new equation from the second equation $10a + 4b = 36$:\n$(10a + 4b) - (4a + 4b) = 36 - 24$\n$10a + 4b - 4a - 4b = 12$\n$6a = 12$\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 6:\n$a = 2$\n\nNow substitute the value of $a=2$ into the equation $a+b=6$ to find $b$:\n$2 + b = 6$\n\nSolving for $b$, we get:\n$b = 4$\n\nSo, the ordered pair is $(a,b)=\\boxed{(2,4)}$.",
