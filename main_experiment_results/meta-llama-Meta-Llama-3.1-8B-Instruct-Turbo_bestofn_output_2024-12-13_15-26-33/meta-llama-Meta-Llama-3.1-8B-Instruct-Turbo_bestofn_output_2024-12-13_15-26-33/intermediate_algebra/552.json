    "To solve this problem, let's first rewrite the given equation as\n\n\\[a_{n + 1} = \\frac{a_n}{a_{n - 1}}.\\]\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that each term after the second term is a reciprocal of the product of its neighbors. We are given that\n\n\\[a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}\\] and \\[a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7}.\\]\n\nSince the given relation is cyclic, with $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $a_3$ being the head of the cycle, we can think of it as the cycle $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$ repeats every 3 integers. \n\nIn order to get $a_{2009}$, we need to first find the remainder when 2009 is divided by 3. To do that, let's calculate the quotient of 3 in 2009. So $2009 \\text{ ]}3 = 669$. The dividend $2009$ can be expressed as \\[2009 = (669)(3) + 1.\\]We see that the remainder is $1$.\n\nSince the remainder is 1, it follows that $a_{2009}$ will have the same value as \\[a_1.\\]\n\n\\[a_{2009} = \\boxed{1+\\sqrt{7}}.\\]",
    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given recursive formula for the sequence $a_n$. The formula is $a_n = a_{n - 1} a_{n + 1}$ for all $n \\ge 2.$\n\nWe will first rearrange the formula to solve for $a_{n + 1}$:\n\\[a_{n + 1} = \\frac{a_n}{a_{n - 1}}.\\]\n\nUsing this rearranged formula, we can simplify the expression for $a_n$ in terms of the preceding terms. In order to get to $a_{2009}$ from the initial term $a_1,$ we'll need to use this formula iteratively:\n\n- For $n = 2,$ $a_3 = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$.\n- For $n = 3,$ $a_4 = \\frac{a_3}{a_2}$.\n- For $n = 4,$ $a_5 = \\frac{a_4}{a_3}$.\n  \nIn this way, we see that $a_n$ is the ratio of two infinite products. We can also observe a pattern in the series of $a_n$'s, which may aid in determining $a_{2009}$: \n\\[a_3 = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = a_{-1}, \\ a_4 = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} = a_{-2}, \\ a_5 = \\frac{a_4}{a_3} = a_{-3}\\] \nBecause we have $a_n = \\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_{n-2}}$, if we substitute $n=3$, we get $a_3 = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ which results in a negative index that indicates $a_{-1}$ Subway. The relationship $a_n \\cdot a_{-n} = a_0$ then follows naturally. Because $a_n \\cdot a_{-n} = a_0$ for every n, $a_0$ becomes an index from which the pattern governing the values of $a_n$ can be derived. Because the pattern was determined by using $n = 2, 3, 4$ for the formula, the resulting formula clearly shows a infinite recursion; thus $a_{-1}, a_{-2}$ can be simplified to $a_2$ and $a_1$. The same applies to all other negative values of $n$. Therefore, for every $n,$ $a_n \\cdot a_{-n} = a_0$. Then, using the formula for $a_{n-1}$,$ $a_n$ in terms of the preceding term in the series $a_n = a_{n+1} a_{n-1}$ and, consequently, \n\\[a_n \\cdot a_{-n} = a_0.\\]  \n\nIf we use $a_{-3} = a_5$ (the same applies to -2 and -1) we get $a_0 = a_4 \\cdot a_5$. Bear in mind that an infinite sequence has terms that have non-negative indices, which are simply the terms $a_n$. Moreover, as the 3-rd index is a part of the sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3,...$ it is, by definition, a term that has a non-negative index. Similarly, as a $4$-th index is also a part of the sequence, $a_4$ is a term that corresponds to a non-negative index. The same applies to $a_5$. \n\nNow we want to find an expression for $a_{2009}$ using the pattern we have determined. To get from the 1rst index ($a_1$ ) to the 2009-th index ($a_{2009}$) we have to perform the following operations on the initial sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3$: \n1) perform $3$ operations on the initial terms $a_1, a_2, a_3$ \n2) get $a_4, a_5, a_6$ that are terms with non-negative indices. There are $3$ indexes/cells in $a_4, a_5, a_6$ that we have not used yet to calculate $a_0$. We then perform the operations corresponding to $a_5 \\cdot a_1 = a_0$ and $a_6 \\cdot a_2 = a_0$, leaving us with a gap of $(2009-3-3)/2 = 1001$ terms. Because $a_4 \\cdot a_5 = a_0$, we need to fill up the gaps $(3-3)/2 = 0$ before we can proceed with calculating the 1000 gaps. However, the value of the term $a_0$ that we obtained above does not have a non-negative index, but $a_0$ is the result of zero gaps: $a_0 = a_4 \\cdot a_5$. As we want to find $a_{2009}$, the resulting formula for $a_{2009}$ is in the sequence\n$a_{2009} = \\frac{a_{2009 - 1}}{a_{2008}}$. Then the we have the formula: $$\\boxed{a_{2009} = \\frac{a_{2010}}{a_{2009}} \\ \\cdot \\ a_{2008}}.$$\nIn order to calculate $a_{2010}$, $a_{2009}$ and $a_{2008}$, we have to perform operations that involve the terms of the initial sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3$. Since we want to get to the term in the index $2008$, we have to perform $(2008-3)/2 = 502$ steps. Then we have:\n$\\frac{a_{2009}}{a_{2008}} = \\frac{a_{2009}}{a_{2008}} = \\frac{\\frac{a_{2010}}{a_{2009}}}{\\frac{a_1}{a_2}} \\Rightarrow$"
