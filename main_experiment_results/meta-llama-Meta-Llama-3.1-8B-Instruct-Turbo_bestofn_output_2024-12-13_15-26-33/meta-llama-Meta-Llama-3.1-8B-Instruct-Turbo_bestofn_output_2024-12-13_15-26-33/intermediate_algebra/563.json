    "To find the number of real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation, we need to start by understanding the given equation.\n\nThe given equation is $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$. \n\nWe can rewrite this as the distance from the point $\\left(\\frac12, -c\\right)$ to the origin in the complex plane, which is equal to $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + (-c)^2}$. \n\nEquating this with $\\frac34$, we get $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + (-c)^2} = \\frac34$.\n\nSquaring both sides, we get $\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + (-c)^2 = \\left(\\frac34\\right)^2$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $\\frac14 + c^2 = \\frac9{16}$.\n\nSubtracting $\\frac14$ from both sides, we get $c^2 = \\frac9{16} - \\frac14$.\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side, we get $c^2 = \\frac9{16} - \\frac4{16}$.\n\nSimplifying further, we get $c^2 = \\frac5{16}$.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $c = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac5{16}}$.\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side, we get $c = \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt5}{4}$.\n\nSince $c$ can be either $\\frac{\\sqrt5}{4}$ or $-\\frac{\\sqrt5}{4}$, the number of real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "To find the number of real values of $c$ that satisfy the given equation, we'll start by using the absolute value definition.\n\nWe know that $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\left|\\frac12\\right| \\cdot \\left|1-i\\right|$. Using the property of absolute value, we can rewrite this as:\n\n$\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + c^2}$\n\nNow, given that $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:\n\n$\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + c^2} = \\frac34$\n\nTo get rid of the square root, we'll square both sides of the equation:\n\n$\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + c^2 = \\left(\\frac34\\right)^2$\n\nNow, we'll simplify both sides of the equation:\n\n$\\frac14 + c^2 = \\frac9{16}$\n\nNext, we'll isolate $c^2$ by subtracting $\\frac14$ from both sides of the equation:\n\n$c^2 = \\frac9{16} - \\frac14 = \\frac9{16} - \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac5{16}$\n\nTo find the number of real values of $c$, we'll take the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\n$c = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac5{16}} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt5}{4}$\n\nSince there are two possible values for $c$, we can conclude that the number of real values of $c$ that satisfy the given equation is $\\boxed{2}$.",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and reach the same conclusion, which is that there are 2 real values of c that satisfy the given equation. However, Solution 3 is the most concise and clearly explains the concept of magnitude of a complex number, making it the best solution.\n\nSo, the index of the best solution is: 3",
  "solution": "We have $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\sqrt{{\\frac12}^2 + (-c)^2} = \\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14}$, so $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ gives us $\\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14} = \\frac34$.  Squaring both sides gives $c^2 + \\frac14 = \\frac9{16}$, so $c^2=\\frac5{16}$.  Taking the square root of both sides gives $c = \\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ and $c=-\\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ as solutions, so there are $\\boxed{2}$ real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nWe also could have solved this equation by noting that $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ means that the complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is $\\frac34$ units from the origin in the complex plane.  Therefore, it is on the circle centered at the origin with radius $\\frac34$.  The complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is also on the vertical line that intersects the real axis at $\\frac12$, which is inside the aforementioned circle.  Since this line goes inside the circle, it must intersect the circle at $\\boxed{2}$ points, which correspond to the values of $c$ that satisfy the original equation.",
