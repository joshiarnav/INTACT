    "Given a polynomial $f(x)$ with real, nonnegative coefficients, we want to find the largest possible value of $f(12)$ given that $f(6) = 24$ and $f(24) = 1536.$\n\nFirst, we'll apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality for Integrals.

With that being said it can be stated that the function was solved for as if no ratios and or partial roots were used for any values that were given.\n\nIn that case, if the statement were to be held true of all instances, without any modifications in fact and that of in reason then it can be stated $f(12)$ would be $12^{n+1}$, since n is defined  as the degree of the polynomial in this problem.\n\nWith that information we can guess what the number for $n$ is.  We were given an answer of 24 when  $x$ was 6 and an answer of 1536 when  $x$ was 24.\n\nLet's try plugging in 24/6 as ratios in $f(x)$, which results in the ratio 4.\n\nBy using $4^{n+1}$, since this is $x$ raised to the power of $n$ and we know that is equal to $12^{n}$ $x$ value of 6 turned into 24 was turned into 1536 in $f(x)$.\n\nBy plugging in 3 instead of $n+1$, since $3^{n+1}$ equates to $3*4$, and $12^{3}$ was $12*12*12=12^{3}$, we can check if the $f(x)$ value turns into a value of 24.\n\nSince $12^{3}=1728$ when $n=3$, this contradicts the idea that n equals 3 and must be equal to 4.\n\nThus, the final answer can be solved as $f(12)=4^{4}=16^{2}=256$"
