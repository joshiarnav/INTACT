    "To find the smallest possible value of n, let's start by analyzing the given information. We are given that the sum of the nonnegative real numbers $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ is 1, and the sum of their squares is less than or equal to $\\frac{1}{100}$.\n\nWe can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to relate the sum of the squares of the $x_i$ to the sum of the $x_i$ themselves. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$,\n\\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \\dots + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \\dots + b_n^2) \\ge (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \\dots + a_nb_n)^2.\\]\nIn our case, we can let $a_i = x_i$ and $b_i = 1$ for all $i$, so the inequality becomes\n\\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_n^2)(1^2 + 1^2 + \\dots + 1^2) \\ge (x_1 \\cdot 1 + x_2 \\cdot 1 + \\dots + x_n \\cdot 1)^2 = (x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_n)^2 = 1^2 = 1.\\]\nIt follows that\n\\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_n^2 \\ge \\frac{1}{n},\\]\nsince the left-hand side is greater than or equal to 1 divided by the right-hand side.\n\nNow, we are given that\n\\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_n^2 \\le \\frac{1}{100}.\\]\nTherefore, we have \n$$\\frac{1}{n} \\le \\frac{1}{100}.$$\nMultiplying both sides by $n \\cdot 100$ to clear the fraction, we get \n$$100 \\le n \\cdot 100.$$\nDividing both sides by 100, we find that\n$$1 \\le n.$$\n\nHowever, $n$ must be a positive integer, since it is the number of nonnegative real numbers we are summing. Therefore, the smallest possible value of $n$ is at least 2. To show that 2 is indeed the smallest possible value of $n$, it suffices to find a sequence of nonnegative real numbers $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ such that $x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_n = 1$ and \n$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_n^2 \\le \\frac{1}{100}$$\nwhen $n = 2$.\n\nFor example, let $x_1 = 0.99, x_2 = 0.01$ (we could have let $x_1 = 0.01, x_2 = 0.99$ to avoid having to remember which number is largest, but we will proceed with the first example), so that\n$$0.99 + 0.01 = 1$$\nand\n$$(0.99)^2 + (0.01)^2 = 0.9801 + 0.0001 = 0.9802 \\le \\frac{1}{100}.$$\nThis example shows that it is possible to have a sequence of nonnegative real numbers $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ such that $x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_n = 1$ and \n$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_n^2 \\le \\frac{1}{100}$$\nwhen $n = 2$, so the smallest possible value of $n$ is indeed $\\boxed{2}.$",
