    "To find the mid-point of a line segment in the complex plane, we can use the midpoint formula, which is the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates. \n\nFirst, let's identify the coordinates of the two end-points: \n- The first point is $-11 + 3i$, so its x-coordinate is $-11$ and its y-coordinate is $3$.\n- The second point is $3 - 7i$, so its x-coordinate is $3$ and its y-coordinate is $-7$.\n\nNow, we find the average of these coordinates to get the coordinates of the mid-point: \n- The x-coordinate of the mid-point is the average of $-11$ and $3$, which is $\\frac{-11 + 3}{2} = -4$.\n- The y-coordinate of the mid-point is the average of $3$ and $-7$, which is $\\frac{3 + (-7)}{2} = -2$.\n\nThus, the coordinates of the mid-point are $-4 - 2i$. The complex number corresponding to this mid-point is $\\boxed{-4 - 2i}$.",

    "To find the complex number corresponding to the mid-point of the line segment, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the coordinates of the two end-points:\n   - The first end-point is $-11 + 3i$, where $-11$ is the real part (x-coordinate) and $3$ is the imaginary part (y-coordinate).\n   - The second end-point is $3 - 7i$, where $3$ is the real part (x-coordinate) and $-7$ is the imaginary part (y-coordinate).\n\n2. Calculate the average of the x-coordinates to find the x-coordinate of the mid-point:\n   - The average of the x-coordinates = $\\frac{-11 + 3}{2} = \\frac{-8}{2} = -4$\n\n3. Calculate the average of the y-coordinates to find the y-coordinate of the mid-point:\n   - The average of the y-coordinates = $\\frac{3 - 7}{2} = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2$\n\n4. Combine the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate to form the complex number corresponding to the mid-point:\n   - The complex number corresponding to the mid-point is $-4 - 2i$.\n\nThe complex number corresponding to the mid-point of the line segment is $\\boxed{-4 - 2i}$."
