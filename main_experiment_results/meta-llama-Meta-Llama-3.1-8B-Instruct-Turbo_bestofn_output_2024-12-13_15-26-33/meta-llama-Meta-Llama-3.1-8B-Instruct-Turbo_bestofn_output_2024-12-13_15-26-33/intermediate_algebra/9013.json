  "critique": "The solution that is the most efficient and easiest to understand is Solution 1. \n\nSolution 1 directly calculates the value of $25^2+72^2$ and then factorizes it to find its prime divisors. It then determines the largest prime divisor, which is 157.\n\nThe other two solutions involve more steps and are more time-consuming. Solution 2 uses modular arithmetic to quickly verify whether 5809 is divisible by specific prime numbers, but this process can be tedious and time-consuming.
