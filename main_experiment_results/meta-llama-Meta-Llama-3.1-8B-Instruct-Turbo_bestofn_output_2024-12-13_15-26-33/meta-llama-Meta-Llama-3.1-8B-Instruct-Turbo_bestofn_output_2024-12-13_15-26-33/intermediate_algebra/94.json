    "To solve this, let's start by looking at the given equation:\n\n\\[az^2 + bz + c = 0.\\]\n\nWe are asked to find the largest possible value of |z|, given the conditions |a| = |b| = |c| > 0. \n\nFirst, we note that the triangle inequality for complex numbers states that for any complex numbers u and v, |u + v| \u2264 |u| + |v|. This can be used to derive the inequality |uv| = |u| |v|.\n\nWe can rewrite the given equation as:\n\n\\[az^2 = -bz - c.\\]\n\nNow, applying the triangle inequality to both sides, we get:\n\n|az^2| \u2264 |-bz - c|.\n\nApplying the property of |uv|, we have:\n\n|a| * |z|^2 \u2264 |b| * |z| + |c|.\n\nSince |a| = |b| = |c|, we can replace these values with a constant, which we'll call k, since |a| = |b| = |c| > 0:\n\nk * |z|^2 \u2264 k * |z| + k.\n\nWe can rearrange this inequality to make it a quadratic inequality:\n\nk * |z|^2 - k * |z| - k \u2265 0.\n\nTo solve this inequality, we can first factor out k and divide by k to get:\n\n|z|^2 - |z| - 1 \u2265 0.\n\nNow, let's rearrange the inequality:\n\n|z|^2 - |z| \u2265 1.\n\nWe can rewrite the left-hand side of the inequality as a quadratic expression:\n\n|z|^2 - |z| = |z| * (|z| - 1) \u2265 1.\n\nSince the left-hand side is a product of |z| and (|z| - 1), and both |z| and (|z| - 1) are non-negative, to get a non-negative product, we need either |z| \u2265 1 or (|z| - 1) \u2265 1. \n\nThis can be rewritten as the following two inequalities:\n\n1 \u2264 |z|\n\nor\n\n|z| - 1 \u2265 1\n\nNow the second inequality is a little more complex to interpret. We can solve it by adding 1 to both sides of the inequality:\n\n|z| \u2265 1 + 1\n\nSimplifying, we get\n\n|z| \u2265 2\n\nHowever, the first inequality is a more direct interpretation of the problem, which directly translates to |z| \u2265 1.\n\nHowever, since a, b and c are of equal magnitude the expression |z|^2 - |z| \u2265 1 is not the best way to go about this problem. A better strategy would be to try and find the \"maximum\" value for which this can occur. \n\nUsing this strategy let's try to express this inequality in a different way. \n\nWe are trying to solve |az^2| \u2264 |b| |z| + |c|.\n\nSince |a| = |b| = |c| we can replace the individual values of |a|, |b| and |c| with |a| and obtain\n\n|a| |z|^2 \u2264  |a|  |z| + |a|\n\n|a| |z|^2 \u2264 |a| (|z| + 1).\n\nNow we can divide both sides by |a| to obtain\n\n|z|^2 \u2264 |z| + 1\n\nThis can be rewritten as a quadratic expression.\n\n|z|^2 - |z| - 1 \u2264 0.\n\nWe know from the original inequality that the inequality can never be less than 0. To find the \"maximum\" value we can rearrange the inequality as\n\n(|z| - 1/2)^2 - 5/16 \u2264 0.\n\nWe can now see the inequality in a clearer form.\n\nFirst, let's add 5/16 to both sides of the inequality to get\n\n(|z| - 1/2)^2 \u2264 5/16\n\nNow, we can see that both sides of the inequality are perfect squares and are non-negative. \n\nThe inequality holds true for\n\n(|z| - 1/2)^2 \u2264 5/16\n\nwhich implies\n\n|z| - 1/2 \u2264 \u221a(5/16)\n\nand \n\n|z| - 1/2 \u2265 -\u221a(5/16)\n\nThe first inequality implies that \n\n|z| \u2264 1/2 + \u221a(5/16)\n\nand \n\n|z| \u2265 1/2 - \u221a(5/16)\n\nThe second inequality is weaker than the first inequality since 1/2 - \u221a(5/16) \u2264 1/2 + \u221a(5/16)\n\nNow, we see that the inequality in the problem statement can never be less than 0. Thus, the maximum value of |z| occurs when the inequality is equal to 0. This can only hold true for a specific value of |z|, which is\n\n|z| = 1/2 + \u221a(5/16)\n\nTo simplify this, we can combine the square roots and simplify further.\n\n1/2 + \u221a(5/16) = 1/2 + \u221a(5)/4\n\nThe square root of 5 can be left as is because this will be in simplest radical form. \n\nTherefore, the maximum value of |z| in the given problem is:\n\n1/2 + \u221a(5)/4\n\nSince we want our solution in the format of a boxed answer, the solution to this problem is:\n\n$\\boxed{1/2 + \u221a(5)/4}$"
