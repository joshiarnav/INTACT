    "To find $|3-2i|\\cdot |3+2i|$, we need to first calculate the absolute value (or modulus) of each complex number. The absolute value of a complex number $a+bi$ is given by $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.\n\nFor $3-2i$, the absolute value is:\n\n$\\sqrt{3^2 + (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 4} = \\sqrt{13}$\n\nFor $3+2i$, the absolute value is:\n\n$\\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 4} = \\sqrt{13}$\n\nNow, we multiply the two absolute values together:\n\n$|3-2i| \\cdot |3+2i| = \\sqrt{13} \\cdot \\sqrt{13} = (\\sqrt{13})^2 = 13$\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{13}$",

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 1 and Solution 2.
