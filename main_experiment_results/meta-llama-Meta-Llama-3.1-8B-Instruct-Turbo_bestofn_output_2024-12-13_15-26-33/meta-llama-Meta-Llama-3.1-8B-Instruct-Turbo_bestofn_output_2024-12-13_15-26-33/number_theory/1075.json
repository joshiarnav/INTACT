    "To convert $199_{10}$ to base 2, we'll start by dividing the number by 2 and noting down the remainders in reverse order.\n\n1. Divide 199 by 2: \n   $199 \\div 2 = 99$ remainder 1\n\n2. Divide 99 by 2: \n   $99 \\div 2 = 49$ remainder 1\n\n3. Divide 49 by 2: \n   $49 \\div 2 = 24$ remainder 1\n\n4. Divide 24 by 2: \n   $24 \\div 2 = 12$ remainder 0\n\n5. Divide 12 by 2: \n   $12 \\div 2 = 6$ remainder 0\n\n6. Divide 6 by 2: \n   $6 \\div 2 = 3$ remainder 0\n\n7. Divide 3 by 2: \n   $3 \\div 2 = 1$ remainder 1\n\n8. Divide 1 by 2: \n   $1 \\div 2 = 0$ remainder 1\n\nNow, we write the remainders in reverse order to get the base 2 representation of $199_{10}$.\n$199_{10} = 11000111_2$\n\nThe number of zeros ($x$) is 3. \nThe number of ones ($y$) is 5.\n\nNow, let's find $y-x$: \n$y-x = 5-3$\n$y-x = 2$\n\nSo, $\\boxed{2}$ is the value of $y-x.$",
    "To convert $199_{10}$ to base 2, we need to find the sum of the powers of 2 that make up 199. \n\nFirst, we will divide 199 by 2 and note the remainder. \n\n199 \u00f7 2 = 99 remainder 1 \n\nNext, we will divide 99 by 2 and note the remainder. \n\n99 \u00f7 2 = 49 remainder 1 \n\nContinue this process. \n\n49 \u00f7 2 = 24 remainder 1 \n24 \u00f7 2 = 12 remainder 0 \n12 \u00f7 2 = 6 remainder 0 \n6 \u00f7 2 = 3 remainder 0 \n3 \u00f7 2 = 1 remainder 1 \n1 \u00f7 2 = 0 remainder 1 \n\nWe can now write down the base 2 representation of $199_{10}$ by reading the remainders from bottom to top.

    "To convert $199_{10}$ to base 2, we'll divide the number by 2 and record the remainders. \n\nFirst, divide 199 by 2: \n\n199 / 2 = 99 remainder 1 \n\nNow, divide 99 by 2: \n\n99 / 2 = 49 remainder 1 \n\nNext, divide 49 by 2: \n\n49 / 2 = 24 remainder 1 \n\nThen, divide 24 by 2: \n\n24 / 2 = 12 remainder 0 \n\nContinuing, divide 12 by 2: \n\n12 / 2 = 6 remainder 0 \n\nNext, divide 6 by 2: \n\n6 / 2 = 3 remainder 0 \n\nThen, divide 3 by 2: \n\n3 / 2 = 1 remainder 1 \n\nContinuing, divide 1 by 2: \n\n1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1 \n\nNow, we need to write down the remainders in reverse order (binary representation). \n\nThe binary representation of 199 is 11000111.\n\nThere are 3 zeros ($x=3$) and 5 ones ($y=5$) in the binary representation. \n\nThe value of $y-x$ is $5-3=2.$ \n\nSo, the answer is: $\\boxed{2}.$"

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and yield the same result. However, I will evaluate each solution based on its clarity, conciseness, and adherence to the problem-solving process.\n\nSolution 1 is clear and concise, but it uses an older method of converting a decimal number to binary by repeatedly dividing by 2 and noting the remainders. This method is still effective but not as efficient as other methods.\n\nSolution 2 is also clear and concise but uses a similar approach to Solution 1. It does not provide any significant improvement over Solution 1.\n\nSolution 3 is the most concise and clear among the three solutions. It uses a straightforward approach to convert the decimal number to binary by repeatedly dividing by 2 and noting the remainders. The solution also clearly states the number of zeros and ones in the binary representation, making it easy to understand.\n\nBased on the evaluation, I would say that Solution 3 is the best solution among the three. Therefore, the index number of the best solution is:\n\n1. Solution 3",
  "solution": "The largest power of 2 that divides $199$ is $2^7$, which equals 128. Since $(1\\cdot 2^7)=128<199<(2\\cdot 2^7)=256$, the digit in the $2^7$ place is $1$. We know that $199-128=71$, and that $71$ can be expressed as $64+4+2+1$, or $(1\\cdot 2^6)+(1\\cdot 2^2)+(1\\cdot 2^1)+(1\\cdot 2^0)$. This means that $199_{10}=11000111_2$. Therefore, $x=3$ and $y=5$; and $y-x=5-3=\\boxed{2}$.",
