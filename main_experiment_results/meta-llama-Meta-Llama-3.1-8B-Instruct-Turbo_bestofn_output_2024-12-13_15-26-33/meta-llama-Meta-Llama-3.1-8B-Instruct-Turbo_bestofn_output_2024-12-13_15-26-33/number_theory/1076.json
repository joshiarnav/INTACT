    "To solve this problem, we will first analyze the pattern of the last two digits of $7^n$ for positive integers $n$.\n\nWe can start listing out the values of $7^n \\pmod{100}$ for small values of $n$ and look for patterns.\n\n- $7^1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{100}$\n- $7^2 \\equiv 49 \\pmod{100}$\n- $7^3 \\equiv 7 \\cdot 49 \\equiv 343 \\equiv 43 \\pmod{100}$\n- $7^4 \\equiv 43 \\cdot 7 \\equiv 301 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$\n\nSince $7^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$, the cycle repeats every 4 powers.

    "To find the digit in the tens place of $7^{2005}$, we need to analyze its last two digits and find a pattern.\n\n1. **Find the last two digits of $7^n$ for small values of n:**\n\n   - For n = 1, $7^1$ = 7 (last two digits: 07)\n   - For n = 2, $7^2$ = 49 (last two digits: 49)\n   - For n = 3, $7^3$ = 343 (last two digits: 43)\n   - For n = 4, $7^4$ = 2401 (last two digits: 01)\n   - For n = 5, $7^5$ = 16807 (last two digits: 07)\n   - For n = 6, $7^6$ = 117649 (last two digits: 49)\n   - For n = 7, $7^7$ = 823543 (last two digits: 43)\n   - For n = 8, $7^8$ = 5764801 (last two digits: 01)\n   - For n = 9, $7^9$ = 40353607 (last two digits: 07)\n   - For n = 10, $7^{10}$ = 282475249 (last two digits: 49)\n\n2. **Identify the pattern and period of the last two digits of $7^n$:**\n\n   We see a repeating pattern for the last two digits of $7^n$: 07, 49, 43, 01, and then it repeats.

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 2. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the problem, and it uses a more efficient approach by utilizing Euler's Theorem to reduce the power of $7^{2005}$.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that Solution 1 and Solution 3 also provide correct solutions to the problem, but they may not be as efficient or elegant as Solution 2.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is 2.",
  "solution": "Let's find the cycle of the last two digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $07, 49, 43, 01, 07, 49, 43, 01,\\ldots$ . The cycle of the last two digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 numbers long: 07, 49, 43, 01. Thus, to find the tens digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=0$ or 1 corresponds to the tens digit 0, and $R=2$ or 3 corresponds to the units digit 4). Since $2005\\div4=501R1$, the tens digit of $7^{2005}$ is $ \\boxed{0}$.",
