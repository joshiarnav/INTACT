    "To solve this problem, we can start by understanding the relationship between the remainders when a number is divided by 15, 3, and 5.\n\nWhen an integer is divided by 15, the remainder is 7. This can be represented as:\n\nn = 15q + 7\n\nwhere n is the integer, and q is the quotient (a whole number).\n\nNow, let's find the remainders when n is divided by 3 and 5.\n\nFirst, let's find the remainder when n is divided by 3:\n\nn = 15q + 7\nn = 3(5q + 2) + 1\n\nIn this expression, we can see that the remainder when n is divided by 3 is 1. So, the remainder is 1.\n\nNext, let's find the remainder when n is divided by 5:\n\nn = 15q + 7\nn = 5(3q + 1) + 2\n\nIn this expression, we can see that the remainder when n is divided by is 2. So, the remainder is 2.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the remainders:\n\nSum = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we'll consider the properties of remainders and divisibility. \n\nGiven: When an integer is divided by 15, the remainder is 7. \n\nWe can represent this as:\nn = 15q + 7, where n is the integer and q is the quotient.\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when n is divided by 3 and by 5.\n\n1. When n is divided by 3:\nTo find the remainder, we'll consider the fact that n is 7 more than a multiple of 15. We need to consider the multiples of 3 and the remainders when divided by 15 (7 is already given).\nSince 15 is a multiple of 3, any multiple of 15 has a remainder of 0 when divided by 3. We can rewrite the original equation as:\nn = 3(5q) + 7\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that n leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 3 (in addition to the multiple of 15).\n\n2. When n is divided by 5:\nSimilarly, when n is divided by 5, it will have a remainder of 7 in addition to the multiple of 15.\n\nNow we can conclude that n leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5. \n\nThe sum of these remainders is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the remainders when the same integer is divided by 3 and by 5 is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's first understand the given information. \n\nWhen an integer is divided by 15, the remainder is 7. This can be written as:\n\nn = 15q + 7, \n\nwhere n is the integer and q is the quotient.\n\nNow, let's find the remainders when the same integer is divided by 3 and by 5.\n\nStep 1: Find the remainder when n is divided by 3.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation n = 15q + 7 as follows:\n\nn = 3(5q) + 7\n\nSince 15q is a multiple of 3 (because 15 is a multiple of 3), the remainder when 15q is divided by 3 is 0.\n\nNow, we can add 7 to the remainder when 15q is divided by 3.\n\nSo, the remainder when n is divided by 3 is:\n\n0 + 7 = 7\n\nThis means the remainder when the integer n is divided by 3 is 1. However we may be surprised by this answer as the 7 in 7 mod 15 seems like it will not divide evenly by 3, which is what the 7 remainder implies, hence in this mod to the 3,\n\n7 \u00f7 3 = 2 with a remainder of 1.\nStep 2: Find the remainder when n is divided by 5.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation n = 15q + 7 as follows:\n\nn = 5(3q) + 7\n\nSince 3q is a multiple of 5 (because we are making 3 and 5 work together as 15), the remainder when 3q is divided by 5 is 0.\n\nNow, we can add 7 to the remainder when 3q is divided by 5.\n\nSo, the remainder when n is divided by 5 is:\n\n0 + 7 = 7 \n\nThis means the remainder when the integer n is divided by 5 is 2.

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 1. \n\nSolution 1 is the most straightforward and efficient solution among the three options. It clearly explains the relationship between the remainders when a number is divided by 15, 3, and 5, and it directly calculates the remainders when the number is divided by 3 and 5. The steps are well-organized, and the calculations are accurate.\n\nSolution 2 is also a clear and concise solution, but it is slightly less efficient than Solution 1. It uses a similar approach, but it uses more words to explain the same concept.\n\nSolution 3 is the least efficient solution among the three options. It makes an incorrect assumption about the remainder when the number is divided by 3 and 5, and it uses incorrect calculations to arrive at the answer. \n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is 1.",
  "solution": "We let our integer be $n$.  the first sentence tells us that  \\[n\\equiv 7\\pmod {15}.\\] Since 3 and 5 are both factors of 15 we deduce \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv2\\pmod5.\n\\end{align*} Therefore the remainders in question are 1 and 2, and their sum is $\\boxed{3}$.",
