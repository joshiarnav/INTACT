    "To find the $100$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{3}{26}$ is expressed as a decimal, we first need to convert the fraction to a decimal. \n\nFirst, let's divide 3 by 26:\n\n   0.1 \n  26 | 3.000000 \n     26.0    \n     -25.99999\n     -0.00001\n\nWe see that 3 divided by 26 is a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$, where the block $153846$ repeats infinitely. This is because the fraction $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal by using long division.\n\nNow, we notice that the decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$ has a repeating block with 6 digits. \n\nTo find the $100$th digit, we first need to find how many times the block repeats, then find the position of the $100$th digit within the block.\n\nWe can find how many times the block repeats by dividing 100 by 6, which is the length of the block. \n\n100 \u00f7 6 = 16 remainder 4\n\nThis means that the block $153846$ repeats 16 times, and the $100$th digit is the fourth digit in the $17$th repetition of the block.\n\nThe first 6 digits of the decimal are $0.1\\overline{153846}$. So, the first few blocks would be:\n\n$0.115384, 615384, 153846, 153846, 153846, 153846, \\ldots$\n\nSo, the $17$th block is the same as the first block, but with $153846$ as the number in the example.\n\nNow, we need to find the $100$th digit. Since the $100$th digit is the fourth digit in the $17$th repetition of the block, we look at the fourth digit of the first block, which is $\\boxed{3}$.\n\nSo, the $100$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{3}{26}$ is expressed as a decimal is $\\boxed{3}$.",

  "critique": "Based on the two solutions provided, I would rate Solution 1 as the best solution. \n\nSolution 1 is more accurate, concise, and easier to understand. It directly identifies the repeating pattern in the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{26}$ and uses this pattern to find the 100th digit. The solution is also well-organized and easy to follow.\n\nSolution 2, on the other hand, is more complex and convoluted. It involves multiple steps and calculations, which can be confusing and prone to errors. Additionally, the solution does not clearly identify the repeating pattern in the decimal representation, which makes it more difficult to understand.\n\nTherefore, I would rate Solution 1 as the best solution, and the index number is 1.",
  "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block. We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$. Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{3}$.",
