    "To find the value of $b$, we need to convert each number from base $b$ to base 10 and then solve the equation.\n\nFirst, let's convert each number from base $b$ to base 10:\n\n- $161_b$ in base 10: $1 \\cdot b^2 + 6 \\cdot b^1 + 1 \\cdot b^0$\n  - $= b^2 + 6b + 1$\n\n- $134_b$ in base 10: $1 \\cdot b^2 + 3 \\cdot b^1 + 4 \\cdot b^0$\n  - $= b^2 + 3b + 4$\n\n- $315_b$ in base 10: $3 \\cdot b^2 + 1 \\cdot b^1 + 5 \\cdot b^0$\n  - $= 3b^2 + b + 5$\n\nNow, we can write the equation in base 10:\n\n$$(b^2 + 6b + 1) + (b^2 + 3b + 4) = (3b^2 + b + 5)$$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$$2b^2 + 9b + 5 = 3b^2 + b + 5$$\n\nSubtract $2b^2 + 9b + 5$ from both sides:\n\n$$0 = b^2 - 8b$$\n\nFactor out $b$:\n\n$$0 = b(b - 8)$$\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions: $b = 0$ or $b = 8$.\n\nHowever, since $b$ is the base, it cannot be 0. Therefore, the value of $b$ that satisfies the equation is:\n\n$\\boxed{8}$",
    "To find the value of $b$, we need to analyze the equation $161_b + 134_b = 315_b$. \n\nSince the equation is in base $b$, we should convert it into a decimal equation for a better understanding. However, we will directly compare the digits.\n\nWe have:\n- $161_b$ \n- $134_b$ \n- $315_b$\n\nLet's start by analyzing the rightmost column, which represents $b^0$, the ones place.\n\nIn the rightmost column, we add 1 + 4 + 5 in base $b$. Since it is greater than $b$, we apply the modulo operation.\n\nIn base $b$, $1 + 4 + 5$ will always result in $10_b$, not just for this specific base. This is because, in any base $b$, the sum of $1 + 4 + 5$ will always result in a number greater than or equal to $b$. Since the rightmost digit in $315_b$ is $5$, we can conclude that $b > 5$.\n\nMoving to the next digit, we consider the sum of $161_b$ and $134_b$ excluding the rightmost column, which results in $6+3$. Since this is greater than $b$, we apply the modulo operation.\n\nNow, looking at the second digit in $315_b$, which is $1$, we know that $b-1$ should be the result of $6+3$ in base $b$ as the modulo result when dividing by $b$.\n\nTherefore, we get $(6+3)/b = 1$ (mod $b$) since the second digit should be 1.\n\nHowever, since we are not obtaining an easy result for $b$, this may not lead us to a specific solution.\n\nInstead, taking another approach, we can rewrite the numbers as a sum of multiples of $b$: \n\n$161 = 1 \\cdot b^2 + 6b + 1$\n\n$134 = 1 \\cdot b^2 + 3b + 4$\n\n$315 = 3 \\cdot b^2 + 1 \\cdot b + 5$\n\nWe can rewrite the original equation as $(1 \\cdot b^2 + 6b + 1) + (1 \\cdot b^2 + 3b + 4) = (3 \\cdot b^2 + 1 \\cdot b + 5)$.\n\nCombine like terms:\n$2b^2 + 9b + 5 = 3b^2 + b + 5$\n\nSubtract $3b^2 + b + 5$ from both sides:\n$-b^2 + 8b = 0$\n\nNow we can simplify the equation by factoring $b$ out: \n$b(-b + 8) = 0$\n\nThe solutions are $b=0$ and $b=8$. However, the base $b$ cannot be $0$ because it is invalid for real-world bases. Therefore, $b$ must be $8$.\n\n$[boxed{8}]$"
