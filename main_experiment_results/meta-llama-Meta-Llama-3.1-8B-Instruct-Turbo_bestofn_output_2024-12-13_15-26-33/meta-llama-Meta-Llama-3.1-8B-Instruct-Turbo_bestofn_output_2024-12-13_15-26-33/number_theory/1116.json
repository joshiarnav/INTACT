    "To find the sum of all integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer, we need to consider the values of $2n - 1$ that divide 20. \n\nStep 1: List all the factors of 20: \nThe factors of 20 are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b14, \u00b15, \u00b110, \u00b120.\n\nStep 2: Since we are looking for the values of $2n - 1$, we consider only the odd factors of 20, which are \u00b11 and \u00b15.\n\nStep 3: Now, we need to find the value of $n$ for each odd factor of 20. \n\n- For $2n - 1 = 1$, we get $2n - 1 = 1 \\implies 2n = 2 \\implies n = 1$\n- For $2n - 1 = -1$, we get $2n - 1 = -1 \\implies 2n = 0 \\implies n = 0$\n- For $2n - 1 = 5$, we get $2n - 1 = 5 \\implies 2n = 6 \\implies n = 3$\n- For $2n - 1 = -5$, we get $2n - 1 = -5 \\implies 2n = -4 \\implies n = -2$\n\nStep 4: Now, we have the values of $n$: $n = 1, 0, 3, -2$. However, $n$ is defined as an integer, so we exclude $n = 0$ from the list.\n\nStep 5: The sum of the remaining values of $n$ is: \n$1 + 3 - 2 = 2$\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "To find the sum of all integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer, we need to consider the possible values of $2n-1$ that divide 20.\n\nStep 1: Find the divisors of 20.\n\nThe divisors of 20 are 1, -1, 2, -2, 4, -4, 5, -5, 10, -10, 20, and -20.\n\nStep 2: Express these divisors in the form of $2n - 1$.\n\nWe can write each divisor as $2n-1$, where $n$ is an integer. However, since $2n-1$ is odd, we can only use the odd divisors of 20.\n\nThe odd divisors are 1, -1, 5, and -5.\n\nStep 3: Solve for $n$ in each of these cases.\n\nFor $2n-1 = 1$, we have $n = 1$.\n\nFor $2n-1 = -1$, we have $n = 0$.\n\nFor $2n-1 = 5$, we have $n = 3$.\n\nFor $2n-1 = -5$, we have $n = -2$.\n\nStep 4: Find the sum of these $n$ values.\n\nWe found the values of $n$ to be 1, 0, 3, and -2. Now, we simply need to add them up.\n\n$1 + 0 + 3 + (-2) = 2$\n\nSo, the sum of all integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer is 2.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "To find the sum of all integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer, we need to identify all the values of $2n-1$ that divide 20. \n\nFirst, we factorize 20: $20=2^2 \\cdot 5$.\n\nSince the denominator of the fraction is $2n-1$, which is an odd number, the numerator 20 also needs to be divisible by $2n-1$. We know that any divisor of 20 will be either a divisor of $2^2$ and a divisor of $5$ or a combination of these.\n\nThe divisors of $2^2$ are 1, 2 and 4. The divisors of $5$ are 1 and 5.\n\nCombining the divisors of $2^2$ and 5, we have the possible divisors of 20 as 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\nHowever, since we're expressing $\\frac{20}{2n-1}$ as an integer, and since the $2n-1$ cannot be even (because it's an odd expression), $2n-1$ cannot equal 2 or 4. Leaving us with 1 and 5 as the only valid $2n-1$ expressions.\n\nSo, $2n-1 = 1$ or $2n-1 = 5$.\n\nFor $2n-1=1$, we have $n = 1$.\n\nFor $2n-1=5$, we have $n = 3$.\n\nTherefore, to find the sum of all integer values of $n$, we add $n=1$ and $n=3$. \n\nThe sum is $1 + 3 = 4$. The answer is $\\boxed{4}$."

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, we need to compare the results of the three solutions. \n\nSolution 1 gives a result of 2, \nSolution 2 also gives a result of 2, \nSolution 3 gives a result of 4.\n\nSince Solution 1 and Solution 2 have the same result, we can compare the steps and process of the two solutions. However, they are almost identical, so we can't strictly say that one is better than the other.\n\nBut when we compare Solution 3 with Solution 1 and Solution 2, we can see that Solution 3 has a different approach and a different result. However, in terms of getting the correct result, Solution 1 and Solution 2 are correct, and Solution 3 is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1 or Solution 2. However, the task is to return the index number (1 to 3) of the best solution, so we can arbitrarily choose one of the two correct solutions.\n\nThe best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is 1.",
  "solution": "The expression $2n-1$ is odd for every integer $n$, and conversely every odd integer takes the form $2n-1$ for some integer $n$.  Therefore, there is one solution $n$ for each (not necessarily positive) odd divisor of 20.  The positive odd divisors of 20 are 1 and 5, so we solve $2n-1=-5$, $2n-1=-1$, $2n-1=1$, and $2n-1=5$ to find the solutions $n=-2$, $n=0$, $n=1$, and $n=3$.  These values for $n$ sum to $\\boxed{2}$.",
