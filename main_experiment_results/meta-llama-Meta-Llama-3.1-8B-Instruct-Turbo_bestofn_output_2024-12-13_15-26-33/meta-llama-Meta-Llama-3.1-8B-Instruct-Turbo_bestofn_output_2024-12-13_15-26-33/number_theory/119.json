  "problem": "In a physical education class, students line up in four rows to do exercises. One particular class has over 30 students, with three rows having the same number of students and one row having one more student than the other three rows. What is the smallest possible class size for this physical education class?",

    "To find the smallest possible class size, let's start by considering the given information: three rows have the same number of students, and one row has one more student than the other three rows.\n\nLet's denote the number of students in each of the three rows with the same number of students as 'x'. Then, the number of students in the row with one more student would be 'x+1'.\n\nSince there are a total of four rows, the total number of students would be the sum of the number of students in each row: 3x + (x+1).\n\nCombining like terms, we get 4x + 1.\n\nNow, we are asked to find the smallest possible class size. We know that the total class size is greater than 30.\n\nTo find the smallest possible value for 'x', we need to find the smallest value of 'x' such that 4x + 1 is greater than 30.\n\nRearranging the inequality, we get:\n4x + 1 > 30\n4x > 29\nx > 7.25\n\nSince 'x' represents the number of students in each row, it must be an integer. Therefore, the smallest possible value for 'x' is 8.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total class size by substituting x=8 into the expression 4x + 1:\n\nTotal class size = 4(8) + 1\n= 32 + 1\n= 33\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible class size for this physical education class is $\\boxed{33}$.",
    "To find the smallest possible class size for the physical education class, we need to find the least number that can be divided into three equal groups and one group that is one student larger.\n\nLet's call the number of students in each of the three equal groups 'x'. Then the number of students in the group with one more student is 'x + 1'.\n\nSince the total number of students is more than 30, we want to find the smallest value of 'x' that satisfies the condition.\n\nThe total number of students in the class can be represented as: \n\n3x + (x + 1) > 30 \n\nCombine like terms: \n\n4x + 1 > 30 \n\nSubtract 1 from both sides: \n\n4x > 29 \n\nDivide both sides by 4: \n\nx > 7.25 \n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a student, the smallest possible value of 'x' is 8. \n\nNow, we can find the total number of students in the class: \n\n3(8) + (8 + 1) = 24 + 9 = 33 \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible class size for this physical education class is: \n\n$\\boxed{33}$"

  "critique": "Based on the two solution attempts provided, both solutions arrive at the same answer: 33. However, Solution 1 provides a more detailed explanation of the steps involved in solving the problem, which makes it easier to understand and follow.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1.",
  "solution": "If the first three rows have 1 student, the last row must have two students, so there are 5 students in total. This is not greater than 30, so we must add another student to each row. This gives 9, which is still not greater than 30. We have to keep adding 4 until we get to a number greater than 30. As a result, we reach 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33. 33 is the first integer greater than 30, so this class has $\\boxed{33}$ students.",
