    "To find the maximum possible value of the greatest common divisor of two consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n = n! + n$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Start by listing the first few terms of the sequence**: \n- For $n = 0$: $a_0 = 0! + 0 = 1$\n- For $n = 1$: $a_1 = 1! + 1 = 2$\n- For $n = 2$: $a_2 = 2! + 2 = 4$\n- For $n = 3$: $a_3 = 3! + 3 = 9$\n- For $n = 4$: $a_4 = 4! + 4 = 28$\n- For $n = 5$: $a_5 = 5! + 5 = 125$\n- For $n = 6$: $a_6 = 6! + 6 = 502$\n\n2. **Consider the formula for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD)**: Since both terms are consecutive, we need to consider the difference between the terms.\n\n3. **Observe the pattern of the GCD**: We observe that $gcd(a_n, a_{n+1})$ will be $gcd(n!+n, (n+1)!+(n+1))$. However, when we factor out the $n!$ we get $gcd(n!+n, n!*(n+1)+n+1)$.\n\nSince n! contains all the factors of n, when we compute the GCD, we're essentially looking for the common factors between n and (n+1)!+n+1. Given the structure of the factorial expansion, any factor in (n+1)n! is larger than any factor in n, except for 1.\n\n4. **Analyze the difference between consecutive terms**: $gcd(n! + n, (n+1)! + (n+1))$ can be simplified as $n+1$. Since any value (beyond 2) in (n+1)n! would be a perfect multiple of any value (including 2, where its the greatest common factor with n) in n.\n\nHowever, this is for checking GCD with consecutive terms, but we should still verify whether this value can actually be a greatest common divisor and instead verify if there's a maximum for the value n could be.\n\n5. **Verify existing results against actual values**: Once $n$ becomes equal to 3, $gcd(n!+n, n+2)$ becomes the $gcd(9,5)$ so from 3 onwards, any gcd computed won't be larger than the starting largest GCD available up to n = 2, n = 1 was the case prior to that.\n\n6. **Verify whether n = 1's case is possible to reach given the nature of the equation provided**: When we plug in 1 where n is 1: \n\nThe value of GCD(n!+n, n+1) which would be the GCD(2,2) (1+1) thus it's definitely the case that at the start, n equals 1 and its the best value possible.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of the greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{2}$",
    "To find the maximum possible value of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n = n! + n$, we can break down the problem into steps.\n\nStep 1: Understand the sequence. \nThe sequence is given by $a_n = n! + n$, where $n \\ge 0$.

  "critique": "Based on the given solutions, the correct maximum value of the greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\nHowever, the second solution incorrectly claims that the GCD cannot be greater than 1, which is not supported by the first solution.

  "solution": "We start by taking the first step in the Euclidean algorithm: subtract the initial two terms. Notice that\n\\begin{align*}a_{n+1} - (n+1)a_n &= (n+1)! + n + 1 - (n+1)(n! + n) \\\\ &= (n+1)! + n + 1 - (n+1)! - n(n+1) \\\\ &= -n^2 + 1 = -(n-1)(n+1).\n\\end{align*}It follows that by the Euclidean Algorithm, \\begin{align*}\\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, a_{n+1}) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, a_{n+1} - (n+1)a_n)\\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, (n-1)(n+1)),\\end{align*}since the minus sign is irrelevant for calculating the gcd.\n\nWe know that $n-1$ divides $n!$, so that $n-1$ is relatively prime to $a_n = n! + n$:\n$$\\text{gcd}\\,(n-1,n!+n) = \\text{gcd}\\,(n-1,n) = 1.$$Thus, we can ignore the factor of $n-1$ completely, and say that\n$$\\text{gcd}\\,(a_n,a_{n+1}) = \\text{gcd}\\,(n! + n, n+1).$$Now, we have several cases, depending on whether $n+1$ is prime or composite. We also have a few edge cases to consider. The basic idea is that when $n+1$ is composite and greater than $4$, $n+1$ is a factor of $n!$, whereas when $n+1$ is prime, we can apply Wilson's Theorem.\n\n$\\textit{Case 0:}$ For $n = 0$, we find that $a_0 = 1, a_1 = 2$, with greatest common divisor $1$.\n\n$\\textit{Case composite:}$\n\n$\\qquad \\textit{Subcase 1:}$ If $n+1$ is composite and can be written as the product of two distinct integers greater than $1$ (say $n+1 = a \\times b$, $a > b > 1$), then $n+1$ divides\n$$n! = 1 \\times \\cdots \\times b \\times \\cdots \\times a \\times \\cdots \\times n.$$By the same argument as before, since $n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime, then $n! + n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime, yielding a greatest common divisor of $1$.\n\n$\\qquad \\textit{Subcase 2:}$ If $n+1 = p^2$ for some prime $p$, then $n! + n = (p^2 - 1)! + p^2-1$. If $2p < p^2 - 1$, then $p$ and $2p$ are both factors that appear in the expansion of $n!$, so $n+1$ divides $n!$ and the previous argument applies. For $p = 2$, we can quickly check that $3! + 3 = 9$ is relatively prime with $4$.\n\n$\\textit{Case prime:}$ If $n + 1 = p$ for some prime $p$, then $n! + n \\equiv (p-1)! + (p-1) \\equiv -2 \\pmod{p}$ by Wilson's Theorem. Thus, $n! + n$ is relatively prime with $n+1$ unless $n = 1$, for which we obtain $a_1 = 2, a_2 = 4$, with greatest common divisor 2.\n\nSo, the largest the greatest common divisor of two consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n$ can be is $\\boxed{2}$, which is achieved when we take $n=1$.",
