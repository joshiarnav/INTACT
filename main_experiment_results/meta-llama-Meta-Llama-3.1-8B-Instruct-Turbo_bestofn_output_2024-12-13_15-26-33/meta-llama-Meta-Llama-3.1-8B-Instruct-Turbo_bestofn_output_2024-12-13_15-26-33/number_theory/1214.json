    "To solve this problem, we need to perform addition in base 6.\n\nFirst, we will line up the numbers according to their place values, making sure that the numbers are aligned in their corresponding places.\n\n   2343\n+ 15325\n\nWe will start adding from the rightmost digit (units place). \n\n units place: 3 + 5 = 8  (but we need to express the result in base 6, so we write 12)\n\nNext, we move one place to the left. \n\n tens place: 4 + 2 = 6\n\nNext, we move one place to the left. \n\n hundreds place: 3 + 5 = 8  (again, we write 12 in base 6)\n\nNext, we move one place to the left. \n\n thousands place: 2 + 1 = 3\n\nNext, we move one place to the left. \n\n ten thousands place: 2 + 0 = 2\n\nNow, we write the result, making sure to keep the correct place values.\n   2343\n+ 15325\n   33122\n\nTherefore, the result is $\\boxed{33122_6}$.",
    "To find the sum of $2343_6$ and $15325_6$, we'll perform the addition step by step, working from the rightmost digits.\n\n1. First, write down the numbers with the base: \n   $2343_6$\n   $15325_6$\n\n   We'll add these two numbers in base 6.\n\n2. Start with the rightmost digits (units place), \n   $3_6$ + $5_6$.\n   Since $3+5 = 8$ in decimal, then in base 6, we write the remainder of 8 when divided by 6 (which is 2) and 'carry the 1'.\n   So, $3_6 + 5_6 = 12_6 = 2_6$ (with a carryover of 1).\n\n3. Now, we add the next digits to the left (sixes place), including the carryover from the previous addition:\n   $4_6$ + $2_6$ (from the previous addition, plus the 1 carryover) = $8_6$.\n   We write $8_6$, because $4+2+1=7$ (in decimal) and when we divide 7 by 6, the remainder is 1.\n\n4. Next, we add the next digits to the left (thirty-sixes place):\n   $3_6$ + $3_6$ = $10_6$.\n   In base 6, $10_6$ is $4_6$ with a carryover of 1.\n\n5. Finally, we add the leftmost digits (two hundred sixteenes place):\n   $2_6$ + $1_6$ (from $1_6$ carryover) = $3_6$.\n   \nAdding all the parts together, we get the final result:\n   $\\boxed{21012_6}$",
    "To solve the problem, we need to follow the steps for adding two numbers in base 6.\n\nFirst, let's write the numbers with their place values:\n\n$2343_6 = (2 \\times 6^3) + (3 \\times 6^2) + (4 \\times 6^1) + (3 \\times 6^0)$\n$15325_6 = (1 \\times 6^4) + (5 \\times 6^3) + (3 \\times 6^2) + (2 \\times 6^1) + (5 \\times 6^0)$\n\nNext, we convert these into a way that's easier to work with. \n\nLet's convert to base 10 first.\n(remember that $x^0=1$) \nThen we can add the two numbers given:\n \n$2343_625=(2\\times 6^3)+(3\\times 6^2)+(4\\times6^1)+(3\\times 6^0)=2 \\times 216 + 3 \\times 36 + 4 \\times 6 + 3 \\times 1$ \n= $432 + 108 + 24 + 3 = 567$.\n\n$15325_625=(1\\times 6^4)+(5\\times 6^3)+(3\\times6^2)+(2\\times6^1)+(5\\times 6^0)$\n\n= $1 \\times 1296 + 5 \\times 216 + 3 \\times 36 + 2 \\times 6 + 5 \\times 1$\n= $1296 + 1080 + 108 + 12 + 5$\n= $2501$\n\nNow we add the two numbers in base 10: \n567 + 2501 = 3068\n\nWe need to express the answer in base 6. To do that, we need to convert 3068 to base 6 \n\nTo convert a number from base 10 to base 6, we keep dividing by 6 and recording the remainders. \n\n3068 \u00f7 6 = 511 with a remainder of 2\n511 \u00f7 6 = 84 with a remainder of 5\n84 \u00f7 6 = 14 with a remainder of 0\n14 \u00f7 6 = 2 with a remainder of 2\n2 \u00f7 6 = 0 with a remainder of 2\n\nNow we write the number in the reverse order of the remainders. \nThe final answer in base 6 is 220502.\n\n$\\boxed{220502}$"

  "critique": "The correct solution is Solution 2. \n\nThe steps in Solution 2 are clear and accurate, and it correctly performs the addition in base 6. \n\nSolution 1 has a small error in the hundreds place addition, where it incorrectly writes 12 as the result of 3 + 5. \n\nSolution 3 is also incorrect, as it first converts the numbers to base 10, adds them, and then converts the result back to base 6.

  "solution": "Adding the first digits, we get $8$, hence $2$ after carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, again with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $2$, with carrying. Finally, adding $1$ to one, we get $2$. Thus our final answer is $\\boxed{22112_6}$.",
