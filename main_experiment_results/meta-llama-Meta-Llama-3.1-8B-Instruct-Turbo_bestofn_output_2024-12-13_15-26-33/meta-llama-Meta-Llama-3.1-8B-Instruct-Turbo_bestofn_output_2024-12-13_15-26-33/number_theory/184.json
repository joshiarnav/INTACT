    "To find the sum of the digits of the decimal representation of $2^{2005} \\times 5^{2007} \\times 3$, let's simplify the expression first.\n\nThe given expression can be rewritten as:\n\n$2^{2005} \\times 5^{2007} \\times 3$\n= $(2 \\times 5)^{2005} \\times 5^2 \\times 3$\n= $10^{2005} \\times 75$\n\nSince $10^{2005}$ is a number consisting of 2005 zeros, when multiplying it by 75, the result will be a number with 2005 zeros followed by 75.\n\nTo find the sum of the digits of the resulting number, we can simply add the digits of 75:\n\n1 + 7 + 5 = 13\n\nTherefore, the sum of the digits of the decimal representation of $2^{2005} \\times 5^{2007} \\times 3$ is 13.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{13}$.",

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 2 and Solution 3. \n\nBoth Solution 2 and Solution 3 correctly simplify the expression to $10^{2005} \\times 75$ and then find the sum of the digits of the resulting number, which is $12$. \n\nHoweverStrictly speaking, Solution 3 is more clear by explaining the multiplication of a number with 75 that is made of 2005 zeros and only 2 digits.
