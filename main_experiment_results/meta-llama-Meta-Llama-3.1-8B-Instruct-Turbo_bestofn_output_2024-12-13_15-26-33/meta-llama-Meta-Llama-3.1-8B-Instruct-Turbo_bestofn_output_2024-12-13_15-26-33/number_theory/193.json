    "To solve this problem, we need to find a number that is a palindrome in both base 2 and base 4.\n\nStep 1: Convert palindromes in base 4 to base 10. \n\nLet's consider the first few palindromes in base 4:\n\n- $22_4$ (base 10: $2(4^1) + 2(4^0) = 10$), which is less than 5 (too low), \n- $33_4$ (base 10: $3(4^1) + 3(4^0) = 15$), which is greater than 5, \n- $44_4$ (base 10: $4(4^1) + 4(4^0) = 20$), which is greater than 15.\n\nStep 2: Convert these base 4 numbers to base 2 to determine if they are also palindromes.\n\n- $22_4$ is equivalent to $1010_2$ (base 2), which is not a palindrome.\n- $33_4$ is equivalent to $1111_2$ (base 2), which is a palindrome.\n- $44_4$ is equivalent to $10100_2$ (base 2), which is not a palindrome.\n\nSince $15$ is the first number greater than 5 that is a palindrome in both base 4 and base 2, we can conclude our answer.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{15}$.",
