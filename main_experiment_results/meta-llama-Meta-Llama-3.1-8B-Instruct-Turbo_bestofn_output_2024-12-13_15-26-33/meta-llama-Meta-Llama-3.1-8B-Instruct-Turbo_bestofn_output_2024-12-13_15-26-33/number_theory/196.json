    "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $1729$ and $1768$, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, a series of steps to find the GCD of two numbers.\n\nStep 1: Divide the larger number ($1768$) by the smaller number ($1729$). \n\n$1768 = 1729 \\times 1 + 39$.\n\nStep 2: Divide the previous divisor ($1729$) by the remainder ($39$) from the last step. \n\n$1729 = 39 \\times 44 + 13$.\n\nStep 3: Again, divide the previous divisor ($39$) by the remainder ($13$) from the last step. \n\n$39 = 13 \\times 3 + 0$.\n\nSince the remainder is now zero, the last non-zero remainder ($13$) is the greatest common divisor of $1729$ and $1768$. \n\n$\\boxed{13}$",
    "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1729 and 1768, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. \n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number, and find the remainder. \n   1768 divided by 1729 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 39.\n\n2. Now, divide the smaller number by the remainder from the previous step. \n   1729 divided by 39 gives a quotient of 44 and a remainder of 13.\n\n3. Again, divide the previous divisor by the remainder from the previous step. \n   39 divided by 13 gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 0.\n\n4.

    "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1729 and 1768, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. \n\n1. Start by dividing the larger number by the smaller number: \n1768 \u00f7 1729 = 1 remainder 39\n\n2. Then, we replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder from the previous division:\n1729 \u00f7 39 = 44 remainder 13\n\n3. Again, we replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder:\n39 \u00f7 13 = 3 remainder 0\n\n4. When the remainder becomes 0, the divisor is the GCD. \n\nTherefore, the GCD of 1729 and 1768 is 13. \n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{13}$."

  "solution": "By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768 - 1729) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 39).\n\\end{align*}Since the sum of the digits of $1729$ is $19$, which is not divisible by $3$, it suffices to check whether or not $1729$ is divisible by $13$. We can find that it is by long division or noting that $12+1 = \\boxed{13}$ divides into $1729 = 12^3 + 1^3$ using the sum of cubes factorization.",
