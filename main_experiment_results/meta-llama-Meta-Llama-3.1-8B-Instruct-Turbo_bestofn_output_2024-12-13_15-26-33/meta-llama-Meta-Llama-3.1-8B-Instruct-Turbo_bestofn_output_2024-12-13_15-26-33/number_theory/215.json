    "To find the units digit of $13^{2003}$, let's start by looking at the pattern of units digits for powers of 13.\n\n- $13^1 = 13$, so the units digit is 3.\n- $13^2 = 169$, so the units digit is 9.\n- $13^3 = 2197$, so the units digit is 7.\n- $13^4 = 28561$, so the units digit is 1.\n- $13^5 = 371293$, so the units digit is 3.\n\nWe can see that the units digits are repeating in a cycle: 3, 9, 7, 1, and then the cycle repeats.\n\nNow, let's find the position of $13^{2003}$ in this cycle. We can do this by finding the remainder when 2003 is divided by 4 (since the cycle has 4 elements).\n\n2003 \u00f7 4 = 500 remainder 3.\n\nSo, $13^{2003}$ is the same as the third element in the cycle. The third element is 7.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "To find the units digit of $13^{2003}$, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, let's look at the pattern of the units digit of powers of 13:\n- $13^1 = 13$ (units digit 3)\n- $13^2 = 169$ (units digit 9)\n- $13^3 = 2197$ (units digit 7)\n- $13^4 = 28561$ (units digit 1)\n- $13^5 = 371293$ (units digit 3)\n- $13^6 = 4811377$ (units digit 7)\n- $13^7 = 61917001$ (units digit 1)\n- ...\n\nWe can see that the units digit of powers of 13 follows a pattern of 4 digits: 3, 9, 7, 1, and then it repeats.\n\n2. Now, let's find the remainder when 2003 is divided by 4:\n$2003 \\div 4 = 500$ with a remainder of 3.\n\nThis means that when we raise 13 to the power of 2003, it's equivalent to raising 13 to the power of 3, since the remainder is 3 and the pattern repeats every 4 powers.\n\n3. Since we know that $13^3$ has a units digit of 7, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is also $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "To find the units digit of $13^{2003}$, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. We need to find a pattern in the units digit of powers of 13. \n\n   Let's calculate the first few powers of 13:\n   - $13^1$ = 13, units digit is 3\n   - $13^2$ = 169, units digit is 9\n   - $13^3$ = 2197, units digit is 7\n   - $13^4$ = 28561, units digit is 1\n\n   We can see a pattern in the units digits: 3, 9, 7, 1, and it repeats.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the remainder when 2003 is divided by 4, because the pattern repeats every 4 powers.\n\n   2003 divided by 4 is 500 with a remainder of 3. \n\n3. Since the remainder is 3, we need to find the units digit of $13^3$.\n\n   We already know the units digit of $13^3$ is 7.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is 7.\n\n$\\boxed{7}$"

  "solution": "Powers of 13 have the same units digit as the corresponding powers of 3; and $$\n3^1 = 3, \\quad 3^2 = 9, \\quad 3^3 = 27, \\quad 3^4 = 81, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 3^5 = 243.\n$$Since the units digit of $3^1$ is the same as the units digit of $3^5$, units digits of powers of 3 cycle through $3, 9, 7,$ and $1$. Hence the units digit of $3^{2000}$ is $1$, so the units digit of $3^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$. The same is true of the units digit of $13^{2003}$.",
