    "To solve the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 27.

    "To find the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the modular inverse of 4 modulo 27**: The modular inverse of an integer 'a' modulo 'm' is an integer 'b' such that $ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$. In this case, we want to find the modular inverse of 4 modulo 27. \n\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse.\n\n    To do this, let's compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4 and 27: \n\n    - 27 = 6 \u00d7 4 + 3\n    - 4 = 1 \u00d7 3 + 1\n\n    Since GCD(4, 27) = 1, the modular inverse exists. Now we'll backtrack to find the modular inverse.\n\n    - 1 = 4 - 1 \u00d7 3\n    - 1 = 4 - 1 \u00d7 (27 - 6 \u00d7 4)\n    - 1 = 7 \u00d7 4 - 1 \u00d7 27\n\n    Therefore, the modular inverse of 4 modulo 27 is 7, as $7 \\times 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}$.\n\n2. **Multiply both sides of the congruence by the modular inverse**: Multiply both sides of the congruence by the modular inverse (7) to isolate 'x':\n\n$7 \\times 4x \\equiv 7 \\times 13 \\pmod{27}$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$28x \\equiv 91 \\pmod{27}$\n\nSince $28 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}$ and $91 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{27}$, we can write:\n\n$x \\equiv 10 \\pmod{27}$\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$ is $\\boxed{10}$."
