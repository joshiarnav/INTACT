    "To find the remainder when the sum is divided by 8, we can first find the remainders of each number individually and then add them. \n\nWe know that a number divided by 8 will have the same remainder as the last three digits of the number. So, we can find the remainder for each of the given numbers:\n\n- For 7145, the remainder when divided by 8 is 5.\n- For 7146, the remainder when divided by 8 is 6.\n- For 7147, the remainder when divided by 8 is 7.\n- For 7148, the remainder when divided by 8 is 0.\n- For 7149, the remainder when divided by 8 is 1.\n\nNow, we add these remainders together: 5 + 6 + 7 + 0 + 1 = 19.\n\nThe remainder of 19 when divided by 8 is 3.\n\nSo, the answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

    "To find the remainder when the given expression is divided by 8, we can first calculate the remainders of the individual numbers when divided by 8.\n\n7145 divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 1 (because 7140 is divisible by 8 and 5 is the remainder when 5 is divided by 8).\n\n7146 divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 2 (because 7140 is divisible by 8 and 6 is the remainder when 6 is divided by 8).\n\n7147 divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 3 (because 7140 is divisible by 8 and 7 is the remainder when 7 is divided by 8).\n\n7148 divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 4 (because 7140 is divisible by 8 and 8 is the remainder when 8 is divided by 8, but since 8 is divisible by 8, we just say 0 remainder is added but since there was 0 left, a 0 is put in front, back to basics this  is like counting in base 8 now, all the prior based counting we based them on base 10 now for short base 8 numbering system  10 in base ten is 12 in base 8. However for 8 mod 8 only 0 remainder).\n\n7149 divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 5 (because 7140 is divisible by 8 and 9 is the remainder when 9 is divided by 8).\n\nNow, we add the remainders of these individual numbers and find the remainder of that sum when divided by 8.\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\n\nNow, we find the remainder of 15 when divided by 8.\n\nSince 8 x 1 = 8, 8 x 2 = 16, the remainder here is 7 (after 15 - 16 = -1 then I am left at this point with only 7, which is the last digit after writing -1 below the vigesimal based 8 + 2 based 8 + 0 + 0 + negative 1+7 more  at ones place so total now known is 7). \n\nTherefore, the remainder when $7145 + 7146 + 7147 + 7148 + 7149$ is divided by 8 is $\\boxed{7}.$"

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, we'll evaluate each solution for clarity, step-by-step logic, and accuracy.\n\nSolution 1 is the most straightforward and accurate. It correctly uses the property that a number's remainder when divided by 8 is the same as the remainder of its last three digits. It then adds the remainders correctly to get the final remainder.\n\nSolution 2 is also accurate but involves more steps, including performing actual division to find the remainders. This approach is more time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nSolution 3 is the least clear and involves incorrect reasoning. It incorrectly calculates the remainders for 7148 and 7149, and the explanation for the remainder of 15 when divided by 8 is confusing.\n\nBased on clarity, step-by-step logic, and accuracy, Solution 1 is the best solution.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
