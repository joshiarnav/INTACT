    "To find the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer, we can start by simplifying the given expression.\n\n$\\frac{n+18}{n} = \\frac{n}{n} + \\frac{18}{n} = 1 + \\frac{18}{n}$\n\nFor this expression to be an integer, $\\frac{18}{n}$ must also be an integer. \n\nNow, we need to find all the positive integer divisors of 18, since these are the possible values of $n$. \n\nThe divisors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer is:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 18 = 39\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{39}$.",

    "To find the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer, we first need to simplify the expression.\n\n$\\frac{n+18}{n}$ can be simplified to $\\frac{n}{n} + \\frac{18}{n}$, which is equal to $1 + \\frac{18}{n}$.\n\nFor $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ to be an integer, $1 + \\frac{18}{n}$ also needs to be an integer.

  "critique": "After reviewing the three solution attempts, I would say that Solution 1 is the most concise and straightforward. \n\nHere's a comparison of the solutions:\n\n- Solution 1 directly identifies the problem and simplifies the expression in one step, making it easy to understand.\n- Solution 2 breaks down the problem into multiple steps, which makes it a bit longer and more verbose.\n- Solution 3 also breaks down the problem into multiple steps, but it includes an unnecessary mention of the value $n=0$.\n\nConsidering the clarity and conciseness of the solutions, I would rate them as follows:\n\n1. Solution 1: Best solution (1)\n2. Solution 2: Good solution (2)\n3. Solution 3: Fair solution (3)\n\nSo, the index number of the best solution is 1.",
