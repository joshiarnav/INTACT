    "To find the sum of the tens digit and the units digit of $9^{2004}$, let's first look at some patterns in powers of 9.\n\nWhen we calculate $9^1$, the units digit is 9.\nWhen we calculate $9^2$, the units digit is 1.\nWhen we calculate $9^3$, the units digit is 9 again (since $9^3 = 9 \\cdot 9^2$).\nThis pattern repeats because $(10k + a)^n$ the end of a power sequence depends on the remainders for a, and n when n is divided by 4 as $((10k + a)^n is the same as ((10k) + (a^4) + a^3 *10k + a^2 *10^2 *k^2 + a *10^3 *k^3)$ for even values of n > 1)\n\nSo for even power n; the pattern cycles. \nUnits of $9^1$ is 9\nUnits of $9^2$ is 1\nUnits of $9^4$ is 1\nUnits of $9^6$ is 9\n\nSince powers of the units in the power cycle $9, 1, 1, 9$, and the power 2004 is even, for $9^{2004}$, the units digit is 1.\n\nFor $9^{2004}$, the tens digit is also 9 because one cycle earlier, the units digit of $9^{2004 -4 }$ which is  $9^{2000}$ is 9 and so when $9^{2000}$ is multiplied by $9^4 $ the product  $9^4 * 9^{2000}$  ending digit is $9^4 *(units digit of  $9^{2000}$)$ where  $9^4$ units digit is 1 hence $9^4*9 =9*1 = 9$ ending digit.\n\nNow the sum of the tens digit (9) and the units digit (1) is $9 + 1 = 10$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the tens digit and the units digit in the decimal representation of $9^{2004}$ is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "To find the sum of the tens digit and the units digit in the decimal representation of $9^{2004}$, we can try breaking down the problem into smaller parts.\n\nStep 1: Consider the units digit of $9^n$ for various values of $n$.\n- When $n=1$, the units digit is 9.\n- When $n=2$, the units digit is 1.\n- When $n=3$, the units digit is 9.\n- When $n=4$, the units digit is 1.\n- When $n=5$, the units digit is 9.\n- When $n=6$, the units digit is 1.\n- When $n=7$, the units digit is 9.\n- When $n=8$, the units digit is 1.\n- When $n=9$, the units digit is 9.\n- When $n\\ge10$, the pattern $9^n$ has a units digit of 1.\n\nStep 2: Determine the pattern of the units digit for any exponent $n$.\nThe pattern repeats every 2 exponents (e.g., 9, 1, 9, 1, ...). This pattern holds for any power of 9.\n\nStep 3: Use this pattern to determine the units digit of $9^{2004}$.\n- Divide 2004 by 2, since the pattern of $9^n$ repeats every 2 exponents.\n- 2004 \u00f7 2 = 1002.\n- The remainder (or the '2' from 2 from 2004 divided by 2) is congruent to 0 (2 even) modulo 2. This tells us that $9^{2004}$ will have  the same units digit as $9^{00}$ (which is 1). Thus the units digit will be $1$.\n\nStep 4: Find the tens digit of $9^{2004}$.\nSince $9^2=81$ (where $81$ has the units of 1), we can multiply $9^{2002}$ to get $9^{2004}$. The tens digit in this value will be the tens digit of $9^2$, which is 8.\nThen the number $9^{2004}$ equals to $9^{2002}\\cdot 9^2$ and  the number $9^{2002}$ has 8 tens digit. 9 squared equals to $9\\cdot 9$ equals to $81$ with unit digit being $1$. Multiply this to get, that $9^{2004}$ has 8 tens digit and 1 unit digit.\n\nStep 5:  Calculate the sum of the tens digit and the units digit.\n- Tens digit: 8\n- Units digit: 1\n- Sum: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nSo, the sum of the tens digit and the units digit in the decimal representation of $9^{2004}$ is 9.\n\n$\\boxed{9}$",
    "To find the sum of the tens and units digits of $9^{2004}$, we can use the concept of cyclicity, which states that the last two digits of a number in a certain base follow a repeating pattern. \n\nLet's examine the last two digits of powers of 9:\n- $9^1 = 09$\n- $9^2 = 81$\n- $9^3 = 29$\n- $9^4 = 61$\n- $9^5 = 49$\n- $9^6 = 41$\n- $9^7 = 69$\n- $9^8 = 21$\n- $9^9 = 89$\n- $9^{10} = 01$\n\nNotice that the pattern $09, 81, 29, 61, 49, 41, 69, 21, 89, 01$ repeats every 10 powers. \n\nSince $9^1$ has a tens digit of $0$ and a units digit of $9$, let's perform the initial calculation. \n\nWe have $2004 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}$.\n\nThus, we have the last two digits as $\\boxed{61}$ from the pattern. Therefore, the sum of the tens digit and the units digit in the decimal representation of $9^{2004}$ is:\n\nTens digit + units digit = $6 + 1 = 7$\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{7}$"

  "solution": "Write $9$ as $10-1$ and consider raising 9 to the 2004 power by multiplying out the expression \\[\n\\overbrace{(10-1)(10-1)(10-1)\\cdots(10-1)}^{2004\\text{ factors}}\n\\] There will be $2^{2004}$ terms in this expansion (one for each way to choose either 10 or $-1$ for each of the 2004 factors of $(10-1)$), but most of them will not affect the tens or units digit because they will have two or more factors of 10 and therefore will be divisible by 100.  Only the 2004 terms of $-10$ which come from choosing $-1$ in 2003 of the factors and 10 in the remaining one as well as the term $(-1)^{2004}=1$ remain.  Let $N$ represent the sum of all of the terms with more than 1 factor of 10.  We have \\begin{align*}\n(10-1)^{2004}&=N+2004(-10)+1\\\\\n&= N-20,\\!040+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-40+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-39.\n\\end{align*} So $9^{2004}$ is 39 less than a multiple of 100 and therefore ends in 61.  The sum of 6 and 1 is $\\boxed{7}$.",
