    "To convert $84_{10}$ to base 2, we need to repeatedly divide it by 2 and record the remainders. We start with 84, and divide it by 2:\n\n- $84 / 2 = 42$ remainder 0\n- $42 / 2 = 21$ remainder 0\n- $21 / 2 = 10$ remainder 1\n- $10 / 2 = 5$ remainder 0\n- $5 / 2 = 2$ remainder 1\n- $2 / 2 = 1$ remainder 0\n- $1 / 2 = 0$ remainder 1\n\nNow, we write the remainders in reverse order: 0 1 0 1 0 0 0\n\nSo, the base 2 representation of $84_{10}$ is $\\boxed{1010100}$",

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 3. It provides a clear and concise explanation of how to convert a decimal number to binary, and it uses a systematic approach to find the powers of 2 that sum up to 84. This approach is more efficient and easier to understand than the other two solutions.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is: 3",
  "solution": "We first find that the largest power of $2$ that is less than $84$ is $2^6 = 64$. Our next step is to find the largest power of $2$ that is less than $84 - 64 = 20$ which is $2^4=16$. This leaves us left with $20 - 16 = 4$, but $4 = 2 ^2$, so we have $$84 = 1 \\cdot 2^6 + 0 \\cdot 2^5 + 1 \\cdot 2^4 + 0 \\cdot 2^3 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 0 \\cdot 2^0.$$Thus, our base $2$ representation of $84_{10}$ is $\\boxed{1010100_2}$.",
