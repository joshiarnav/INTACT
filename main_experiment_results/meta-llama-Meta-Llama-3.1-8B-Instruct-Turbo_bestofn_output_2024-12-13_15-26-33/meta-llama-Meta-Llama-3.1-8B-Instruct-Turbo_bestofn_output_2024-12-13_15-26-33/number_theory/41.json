    "To find the smallest possible value for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$, we can use the fact that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm.\n\nGiven $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$, we can write the equation:\n\\[k\\cdot\\ell=\\gcd(k,\\ell)\\cdot\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]\\]\nSo,\n\\[k\\cdot\\ell=3\\cdot\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]\\]\nWe want to minimize the product $k\\cdot\\ell$, which will minimize the value of $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$.\n\nFor $k$ and $\\ell$ to be positive 4-digit integers, the smallest possible values are $1002$ and $1005$. Note that both $1002$ and $1005$ are divisible by $3$, but $1002$ is also divisible by $337$ and $1005$ is not divisible by this. However, $1002$ and $1005$ are not multiples of each other or any other common prime. \n\nSince $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$ and $1002$ and $1005$ are both multiples of 3, then their gcd must be $3.$\n\nUsing the above formula, we see that minimizing the product $k\\cdot\\ell$ to $3 \\times 1002$ gives us the smallest value of $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$ as\n\\[\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]=\\frac{k\\cdot\\ell}{\\gcd(k,\\ell)}=\\frac{3006}{3}=\\boxed{1002}\\]",
    "To find the smallest possible value for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$, we need to consider the relationship between the LCM and GCD of two numbers. \n\nAccording to the property of GCD and LCM, we have:\n\\[ \\gcd(k,\\ell) \\times \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = k\\ell \\]\n\nThis gives us:\n\\[ \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = k\\ell / \\gcd(k,\\ell) \\]\n\nSince $\\gcd(k,\\ell) = 3$, we get:\n\\[ \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = k\\ell / 3 \\]\n\nNow we need to find the smallest positive 4-digit integers $k$ and $\\ell$ such that $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$. We can use the fact that the smallest positive 4-digit integer is $1000$.\n\nTo get the smallest 4-digit numbers $k$ and $\\ell$ with a GCD of 3, we can consider the multiples of 3. However, we also need to ensure that the two numbers are relatively prime except for their GCD of 3.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by setting one number to the smallest 4-digit multiple of 3 that is relatively prime to another multiple of 3.\n\nSince the two numbers are relatively prime except for their GCD of 3, we can use 3 as one number, and the next smallest multiple of 3 that is also a 4-digit number is 1002.\n\nHowever, just taking 1002 doesn't work as $\\gcd(1002,1002)$ is 1002. One solution is for $\\ell$ to be 1002, so that $k$ must be 1005: \nThe smallest 4-digit number that is 3 more than a multiple of 3 and is greater than 1002 would be 1005. Given  $\\ell=1002$, we have $k=1005$.\n\nHowever, this might not be the smallest $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$ we can achieve with the given restrictions. We should look for another pair of numbers so we could minimize $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$. In the LCM, k * l / GCD, the smaller GCD we have, the smaller LCM.\n \nBut, given the restrictions $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$, we can generate one number and another 3 away from this number so the two numbers would be 3 away from each other. In sequence 1002 is three more than 999 but we passed 1002. So we can achieve the smallest possible k by taking the sequence 1005 which is three more than 1002, 1008 is three more than 1005, and the lowest of these is 1002 and the highest of these is 1005. One solution is for $\\ell$ to be 1002, so that $k$ must be 1005 but we passed 1002.\n\nSo the possible smallest 4 digit integers would be $\\ell=1002$ and $k=1005$.

Given $\\gcd(k,\\ell) = 3$ and $k=1005$, $l=1002$.\nWe can choose the product $k\\ell = 1005 \\times 1002 = 1013010$.

  "solution": "The identity $\\gcd(k,\\ell)\\cdot\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = k\\ell$ holds for all positive integers $k$ and $\\ell$.
