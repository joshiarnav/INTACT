    "To find the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$, we first need to solve for $x$ in both congruences.\n\nGiven $4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$, let's simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor of $4$ and $20$, which is $4$. We get $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$.\n\nGiven $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$, let's simplify the equation. Since $3$ and $20$ have no common factors, we can't simplify this equation using the greatest common divisor. However, we can multiply both sides by the modular multiplicative inverse of $3$ modulo $20$. The modular multiplicative inverse of $3$ modulo $20$ is $7$ because $3\\cdot7\\equiv1\\pmod{20}$. Now, we get $7\\cdot3x\\equiv7\\cdot16\\pmod{20}$, which simplifies to $x\\equiv112\\pmod{20}$, further simplifying to $x\\equiv12\\pmod{20}$.\n\nThe two congruences for $x$ are $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$ and $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$. Since $5$ is a divisor of $20$, we can combine these congruences into a single congruence using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which in this case simplifies to $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$.\n\nSince $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$, the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$ is the remainder when $12^2$ is divided by $20$. $12^2$ is equal to $144$. The remainder when $144$ is divided by $20$ is $4$. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to first find the value of $x$ that satisfies both congruences.\n\nThe given congruences are:\n\n1) $4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$\n\n2) $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$\n\nFirst, we can simplify the first congruence by dividing both sides by $4$ and keeping the modulus the same. However, we can also use the property that $4$ and $20$ are not coprime (they share $4$ as a factor), so we will have to adjust our modulus to $20/4 = 5$ to show that $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. However, that wouldn't have any value here, but we do note $x \\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$.\n\nFor the second congruence, we can multiply both sides by the modular multiplicative inverse of $3$ modulo $20$ to isolate $x$. The modular multiplicative inverse of $3$ modulo $20$ is $7$ since $(3*7) \\equiv 1\\pmod{20}$. \n\nSo we have:\n   \n$3x \\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$\n$(3x) * (7) \\equiv (16) * (7) \\pmod{20}$ \nTherefore:\n$21x\\equiv112\\pmod{20}$\nSince $x \\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$, from $21x \\equiv 112\\pmod{20}$, we then manipulate $x$ further by subtracting $12$ from both sides (since we know $x\\equiv12\\pmod{20}$). We now get:\n$x \\equiv 4\\pmod{20}$ \n\nNow that we have the value of $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{20}$, we can find the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$. \n\nLet us compute this:\n$x^2 \\equiv (4)^2 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{20}$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$ is $\\boxed{16}.$",
    "To find the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$, we need to first solve for $x$ in the given congruences.\n\nGiven:\n$4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$ and $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$\n\nWe can start by simplifying the first congruence to make it easier to solve. Since $4$ and $20$ have a common factor of $4$, we can divide both sides of the congruence by $4$ to get:\n\n$4x \\div 4 \\equiv 8 \\div 4 \\pmod{20 \\div 4}$\n$x\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$\n\nThis simplifies the first congruence to $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$. \n\nNow we need to solve the second congruence $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$. Since $3$ and $20$ are not relatively prime (they have a common factor of $1$ but $3$ is not a multiple of $20$), we will stick with the congruences' variables as is for now. \n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm or checking numbers divisible by $20$ which satisfy the equation in the question we can find the solutions and check $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$. Among numbers divisible by $20$ (including $-20$), one number we want to check is $20$. This number is not correct since it violates the initial condition of $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$. We should then check 40 then 60 then 80. Then finally 100 works, but 120 doesn't so... we know $x=100$.\n\nThus our solutions in the form that solve to both given equations may be $x=\\pmod{20}$ values of $100$ or $40$. Then the square of an integer which satisfies the congruence - $x^2$ - may only take multiples of $20$ which we can square to find. In these instances $x^2$ will be multiples of $20$. However since their difference in $x$ is $60$ you should be able to make an argument that every integer in the $0$ to $20$ range which is a multiple of $4$ will be satisfied.  The square in these instances we find is as follows: To evaluate which value amongst them could be a valid answer amongst these values in the last instance.  Then you can square $4$, $8$, $12$ and $16$, of them we will evaluate them as follows. Evaluating all these we get:\n$4^2=16$ \n$8^2=64$ \n$12^2=144$ \n$16^2=256$. Check each answer against $x=\\pmod{20}$ values of $100$ or $40$. The values in which the remainders coincide are in the list of values {16}.\n\nWe can find the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$ by finding the remainder of each square in the list when divided by $20$.\n\nThe remainder of $16\\div 20$ is $16$.\n\nThe remainder of $64\\div 20$ is $4$.\n\nThe remainder of $144\\div 20$ is $4$.\n\nThe remainder of $256\\div 20$ is $16$.\n\nNow, the solution that satisfies the congruences is the set of values $\\{16, 4\\}$.\n\nHowever, we know that the values of $x$ that satisfy both congruences are $100$, and a second lessened $x$ value that is less than 100 (i.e., values $x=40, x=20, x=0$), then we need to check their squares to see what the value is. In doing this we find that every value the equation results with will end up getting us the equation {4}. We are trying to determine the remainder when we take the value of $4^2$ the value of $16^2$.  Taking into consideration these results, then we may determine that $4$ is the value that has to satisfy the remainder condition for $20$, in this scenario.\n\nTherefore the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$ is $\\boxed{4}$."
