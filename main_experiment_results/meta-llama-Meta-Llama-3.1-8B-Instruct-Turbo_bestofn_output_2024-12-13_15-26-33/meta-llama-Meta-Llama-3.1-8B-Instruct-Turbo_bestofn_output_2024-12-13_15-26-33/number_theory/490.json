    "To convert $\\frac{3}{1250}$ into a decimal, we can first simplify it by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, which is 1. Now that the fraction is in its simplest form, we can convert it to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator.\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of 1250, which is $2 \\times 5^4$. We can also express the denominator as $2 \\times 5^4$, which when relating it to the numerator becomes $3/(2 \\times 5^4)$.\n\nSince 3 is of the form $3 \\times 5^{-4}$, or $3 \\div 5^4$, we can now convert this into a decimal: \n\n3/100000 \nFirst non zero digit is 3 therefore we are only looking to see how many zeros will be before that digit: \n   0.0003\n\nThere are 4 zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit, so our answer is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "To convert $\\frac{3}{1250}$ to a decimal, let's first simplify it by finding the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator. \n\nIn this case, the greatest common divisor of $3$ and $1250$ is $1$, as $3$ and $1250$ are relatively prime. However, we can simplify the fraction by finding a common factor with $1250$. Since $1250 = 5^4$, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by $5^3$, which equals $125$. \n\n$\\frac{3}{1250} = \\frac{3}{1250} \\times \\frac{1}{125} = \\frac{3}{15625}$\n\nNow, we can simplify it further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, but we will note that its already in simplest terms in our simplified fraction so it is best to notice that $15625 = 5^6$. \n\n$\\frac{3}{15625} = \\frac{3}{5^6}$ \n\nNow, let's convert $\\frac{3}{5^6}$ to a decimal. We know that $5^6$ equals $15625$, so we can rewrite the fraction as:\n\n$\\frac{3}{15625}$\n\nNow, let's divide $3$ by $15625$. We can do this by adding a decimal point after the $3$ and then a zero, since $3$ is a single-digit number. \n\n$0.00019$\n\nNow, let's count the number of zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit. In the decimal $0.00019$, we have four zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{4}$."

  "solution": "Rather than doing long division, we will write the given fraction to have a denominator of the form $10^b=2^b \\cdot 5^b$, where $b$ is a positive integer. First, we write $\\dfrac{3}{1250}$ as $\\dfrac{3}{2^1 \\cdot 5^4}$. To make the denominator fit the form $2^b \\cdot 5^b$, we make $b$ the larger of the two exponents, which in this case is $4$. Thus, we have $$\\frac{3}{5^4 \\cdot 2^1} \\cdot \\frac{2^3}{2^3}=\\frac{3 \\cdot 2^3}{5^4 \\cdot 2^4} = \\frac{24}{10^4}$$The exponent in the denominator is $4$, and $24$ are the last two digits. Therefore, there are $4-2=\\boxed{2}$ zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit.",
