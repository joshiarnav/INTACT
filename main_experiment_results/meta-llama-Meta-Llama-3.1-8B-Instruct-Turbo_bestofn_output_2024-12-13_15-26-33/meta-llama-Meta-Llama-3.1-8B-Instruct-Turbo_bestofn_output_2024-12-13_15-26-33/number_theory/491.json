    "We can represent the given information as equations:\n\n$a = 45q_1 + 37$ (where $q_1$ is an integer)\n$b = 30q_2 + 9$ (where $q_2$ is an integer)\n\nNow, let's find the expression for $a+b$:\n\n$a+b = (45q_1 + 37) + (30q_2 + 9)$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$a+b = 45q_1 + 30q_2 + 46$\n\nWe want to find the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15. To make it easier, let's break down 45 and 30 into multiples of 15. \n\n$a+b = 15(3q_1 + 2q_2) + 46$\n\nWe can break down 46 into 45 + 1, and we can further break down 45 into two times 15 and 5 is 15 + 15. Here, 15 is our divisor and $3q_1 + 2q_2$ is a multiple of 15. When a number that is a multiple of 15 is divided by 15, it is 0 and leaves no remainder. The term 3q1 + 2q2 is also always an integer. \n\nTherefore, when we divide $a+b$ by 15, the remainder will be 1 (from 45 + 1, where the 45 can be considered as a multiple of 15 plus 15, and when it is divided by 15 the multiple will contribute 0 remainder to the result).\n\nSo, the remainder he gets when he divides $a+b$ by 15 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Inspect the remainder of $a$ when divided by 45:\nWhen Marcus divides $a$ by 45, he gets a remainder of 37. We can represent $a$ as:\n$a = 45q_1 + 37$\nwhere $q_1$ is an integer (the quotient of the division).\n\n2. Simplify the expression for $a$ with respect to divisibility by 15:\nWe would like to represent $a$ as multiples of 15 plus a remainder. \nWe can write $45=3\\times 15$ and thus factor out $15$ in our expression for $a$, yielding: \n$a=15(3q_1)+37$. Now, we want to express 37 as a multiple of 15 plus some remainder. $37=2\\times15+7$. This implies $a$ can be written as: \n$a=\\text{multiple of 15} + 7$.\n\n3. Inspect the remainder of $b$ when divided by 30:\nWhen Marcus divides $b$ by 30, he gets a remainder of $9$. We can represent $b$ as:\n$b = 30q_2 + 9$\nwhere $q_2$ is an integer (the quotient of the division).\n\n4. Simplify the expression for $b$ with respect to divisibility by 15: \n$b=30(2q_2)+9$. Here we can rewrite $9$ as $15-6$. This means $b$ can be written as:\n$b = \\text{multiple of 15}+6$.\n\n5. Sum the expressions for $a$ and $b$:\n$a + b = (\\text{multiple of 15} + 7) + (\\text{multiple of 15}+6)$ \nWe remove the multiples of 15 from each number because they're multiples and don't affect the remainder when dividing by 15. Adding them results in: \n$a+b = (7+6)+(\\text{multiples of 15})=13+(\\text{multiple of 15})$.\n\n6. Express the sum as a multiple of 15 plus a remainder:\nAs we've already shown, the multiple of 15 can be removed because by Inspect number 5. we realized that we could ignore the multiples as we only concerned with the remainder as we're only interested in remainder when dividing by 15. The expression is already simplified. \nThe remainder of dividing into this is thus 13.\n\nThe remainder when dividing $a+b$ by 15 is $\\boxed{13}$.",
    "To find the remainder when Marcus divides $a+b$ by 15, we need to consider the information about the remainders when he divides $a$ and $b$ by 45 and 30, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the situation with $a$: when $a$ is divided by 45, the remainder is 37. This can be written as:\n\n$$a = 45q + 37$$\n\nwhere $q$ is the quotient (an integer). When we divide $a$ by 45, the remainder is 37.\n\nNext, let's analyze the situation with $b$: when $b$ is divided by 30, the remainder is 9. This can be written as:\n\n$$b = 30r + 9$$\n\nwhere $r$ is the quotient (an integer). When we divide $b$ by 30, the remainder is 9.\n\nTo find the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15, we need to add the equations for $a$ and $b$:\n\n$$a + b = (45q + 37) + (30r + 9)$$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$$a + b = 45q + 30r + 46$$\n\nNow, let's try to make this expression easier to work with. We can write 45 as 3 times 15, so we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n$$a + b = 3(15q) + 30r + 46$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite 30 as 2 times 15, so we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n$$a + b = 3(15q) + 2(15r) + 46$$\n\nNow, we can rewrite 46 as 33 (which is 3 times 11) plus 13, and since 13 is greater than 15, we must subtract 15 to be under 15 to make it easier. 13 is 1 less than 15.  Then let's take the expression and move that 46 to the other side. \n\n$$46-15=31$$\n\n$$31=3(10+1)+2(0)+1(15+1+1)+1(1)$$\n\n To shorten this,\n\n$$(46)\\mod{15}$$\n$$3(10)+2(0)+1(15)+1(1)=46-1$$\n$$46-1=45$$\n\nBut let's actually get the clean and original final in terms of (q,r). Claim that(r+3)(q) is actually q in final division.\n \n We subtract the 46 from both sides. So, \n$$a+b=15q+3(15q)+2(15r)+31$$\n$$a+b=3(15q)+2(15r)+15(q+r)+31$$\n$$a+b=15(q+r+3q)+31$$\n$$a+b=15(q+3q+r)+31$$ \n$$a+b=15(4q+r)+31$$\n $$a+b\\mod{15}=31\\mod{15}$$\n$$a+b\\mod{15}=16\\mod{15}$$\n$$a+b\\mod{15}=(15+1)\\mod{15}$$\n$$a+b\\mod{15}=1\\mod{15}$$\n$$a+b\\mod{15}=\\boxed{1}$$"
