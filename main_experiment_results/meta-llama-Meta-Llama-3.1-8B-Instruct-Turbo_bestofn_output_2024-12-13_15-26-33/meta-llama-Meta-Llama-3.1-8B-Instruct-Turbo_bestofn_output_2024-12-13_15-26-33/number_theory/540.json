    "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **First simplify the right side**: \n   We need to simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$. This means we find the remainder when $1234$ is divided by $7$. \n\n   We can see that  $1234 \\div 7$ leaves a remainder of $2$, since $7 \\cdot 176 = 1232$ and $1234 - 1232 = 2$. \n\n   Therefore, we have $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n2. **Simplify the left side**:\n   We need to simplify $17n \\pmod{7}$. This means we find the remainder when $17n$ is divided by $7$.\n\n   Since $17 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ (because $17 \\div 7$ leaves a remainder of $3$), we have $17n \\equiv 3n \\pmod{7}$.\n\n3. **Solve for $n$**:\n   Now we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n   To do this, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of $3 \\pmod{7}$. This is the integer $x$ such that $3x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n   We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the multiplicative inverse, but in this case, we can do it by inspection.\n\n   We see that $3 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$ (because $15 \\div 7$ leaves a remainder of $1$).\n\n   Therefore, the multiplicative inverse of $3 \\pmod{7}$ is $5$.\n\n4. **Use the multiplicative inverse to solve for $n$**:\n   Now that we have the multiplicative inverse of $3 \\pmod{7}$, we can multiply both sides of the congruence $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$ by $5$, which gives us $n \\equiv 5 \\cdot 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n5. **Simplify to find the value of $n$**:\n   We need to simplify $5 \\cdot 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n   We can see that $5 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 10 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ (because $10 \\div 7$ leaves a remainder of $3$).\n\n   Therefore, we have $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n6. **The smallest positive integer $n$**:\n   The smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ is simply $n = 3$.\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "To solve the congruence $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the right side**: \nFirst, let's simplify the right side of the congruence by finding the remainder of 1234 divided by 7.\n\n$1234 \\div 7 = 176$ with a remainder of $2$\n\nSo, we have $17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n2. **Simplify the left side**: \nNext, let's simplify the left side of the congruence by finding the remainder of 17 divided by 7.\n\n$17 \\div 7 = 2$ with a remainder of $3$\n\nSo, we can rewrite the congruence as $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n3. **Find the multiplicative inverse of 3**: \nTo solve for $n$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 7, which is an integer $x$ that satisfies $3x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nAfter checking possible values of $x$ from 1 to 6, we find that $3 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$, so the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 7 is $5$.\n\n4. **Multiply both sides by the multiplicative inverse**:\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the congruence $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$ by the multiplicative inverse $5$, which gives $n \\equiv 5 \\cdot 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nThus, $n \\equiv 10 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n5. **Simplify $n \\equiv 10 \\pmod{7}$**:\nFinally, we simplify the congruence by finding the remainder of $10$ divided by 7.\n\n$10 \\div 7 = 1$ with a remainder of $3$\n\nSo, $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nThe smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies this congruence is $n = \\boxed{3}$.",
    "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the modulus**: First, we need to simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$. The remainder when $1234$ is divided by $7$ is $2$, because $1234 = 176 \\times 7 + 2$.\n\n   So, we have: $17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n2. **Simplify the coefficient**: Next, we simplify the coefficient $17 \\pmod{7}$. Since $17 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$, we can rewrite the original congruence as: $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n3. **Find the modular inverse**: To solve for $n$, we need to find the modular multiplicative inverse of $3 \\pmod{7}$. A modular inverse of an integer $a$ modulo $m$ is an integer $x$ such that $ax \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$. In this case, we need to find the modular inverse of $3 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n   Using the Euclidean algorithm or trying numbers, we find that $5$ is the modular inverse of $3 \\pmod{7}$, because $3 \\times 5 \\equiv 15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n4. **Multiply both sides by the modular inverse**: We can now multiply both sides of the congruence equation by the modular inverse of $3$ modulo $7$, which is $5$. This gives: $5 \\times 3n \\equiv 5 \\times 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n   Simplifying, we get: $n \\equiv 10 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n5. **Find the smallest positive integer**: The congruence equation $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ means that $n$ can be any integer of the form $7k + 3$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer. To find the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies this congruence, we can choose $k = 0$.\n\n   So, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$ is: $\\boxed{3}$"

  "solution": "First, we simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$ to $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, we have $$17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$This means that $17n$ can be written in the form $7a+2$, where $a$ is an integer. So we have $17n=7a+2$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\\frac{7a+2}{17}=n$ is an integer. By trying values for $a$, we find that the smallest integer $a$ which satisfies the equation is $7$. Therefore, the least value for $n$ is $\\frac{51}{17}=\\boxed{3}$.",
