    "To find the possible quantities of cupcakes that Claire could have, let's define the quantity of cupcakes Claire has as 'x'.\n\nWhen Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 5, she has 3 remaining, so x \u2261 3 (mod 5).\n\nWhen Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 remaining, so x \u2261 4 (mod 7).\n\nWe can rewrite the first congruence as x = 5a + 3 and the second as x = 7b + 4, where a and b are integers.\n\nSince both equations are equal to x, we can set them equal to each other: \n5a + 3 = 7b + 4\n\nNow, we'll solve for the smaller equation and iteratively update the equations for smaller and smaller possible values of a and b that still make 5a + 3 = 7b + 4 true.\n\nLet's lowe left side by 3 and right side by 4:\n5a = 7b + 1\n\nNow let's list more numbers that fit 5a (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60)\n\nFor each of these numbers we calculate 7b + 1\n\nOut of the following 7b + 1 = (7 * a) + 1\n\n- 5 =  (1 * 7) + (-2) (-not possible)\n- 10 =  (1 * 7) + 3 (-not possible)\n- 15 =  (2 * 7) + 1 (works for a = 2 and b = 2)\n- 20 =  (3 * 7) + 3 (-not possible)\n- 25 =  (4 * 7) + 1 (works for a = 4 and b = 4)\n- 30 =  (6 * 7) + 3 (-not possible)\n- 35 =  (6 * 7) + 1 (works for a = 6 and b = 5)\n- 40 =  (8 * 7) + 3 (-not possible)\n- 45 =  (9 * 7) + 1 (works for a = 9 and b = 6)\n- 50 =  (11 * 7) + 3 (-not possible)\n- 55 =  (12 * 7) + 1 (works for a = 12 and b = 7)\n- 60 =  (15 * 7) + 3 (-not possible)\nSince 15 is the first value we can write the following:\nx = 5a + 3 = 5 * 2 + 3 = 13\nAs 13 fits the second condition too, 13 is possible.\nx = 5a + 3 = 5 * 4 + 3 = 23\nAs 23 fits the second condition too, 23 is possible.\nx = 5a + 3 = 5 * 6 + 3 = 33\nAs 33 fits the second condition too, 33 is possible.\nx = 5a + 3 = 5 * 9 + 3 = 48\nAs 48 fits the second condition too, 48 is possible.\nx = 5a + 3 = 5 * 12 + 3 = 63\nThis is over 60.\nAs we found possible values of 13, 23, 33, 48 we are done.\nSo the sum of all the quantities that Claire could have is \n13 + 23 + 33 + 48 = 117.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{117}$.",

  "solution": "If Claire has $N$ cupcakes, we know that $N = 5x+3$ and $N = 7y+4$ for some integers $x$ and $y$. Equating these two forms of $N$, we have $7y+1=5x$. We also know that $N<60$. We can write out all the sufficiently small possible values of $7y+1$: $$1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57.$$Of these, the numbers that are also of the form $5x$ are $15$ and $50$.
