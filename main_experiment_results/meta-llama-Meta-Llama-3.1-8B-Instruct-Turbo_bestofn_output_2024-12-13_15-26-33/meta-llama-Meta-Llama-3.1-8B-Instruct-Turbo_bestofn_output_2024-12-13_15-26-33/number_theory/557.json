    "To find the units digit of $5^4$, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. The units digit of $5^1$ is 5.\n2. The units digit of $5^2$ is 25, which has a units digit of 5.\n3. The units digit of $5^3$ is 125, which has a units digit of 5.\n4. The units digit of $5^4$ is 625, which has a units digit of 5.\n\nTherefore, the units digit when $5^4$ is multiplied out is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "To find the units digit of $5^4$, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to find the units digit of $5^1$. \n   - $5^1 = 5$, and the units digit is 5.\n\n2. Now, we need to find the units digit of $5^2$.\n   - $5^2 = 5 \\times 5 = 25$, and the units digit is 5.\n\n3.
