    "Let's denote the three integers as $a$, $b$, and $c$. \n\nGiven that when $a$, $b$, and $c$ are divided by $24$, they leave remainders of $10$, $4$, and $12$, respectively. \n\nThis can be written as equations:\n$a = 24p + 10$\n$b = 24q + 4$\n$c = 24r + 12$\n\nwhere $p$, $q$, and $r$ are integers.\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n\n$a + b + c = (24p + 10) + (24q + 4) + (24r + 12)$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$a + b + c = 24p + 24q + 24r + 26$\n\nSince $24p + 24q + 24r$ is a multiple of $24$, we can simplify it to $24k$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nSo, the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ becomes:\n\n$a + b + c = 24k + 26$\n\nWhen this sum is divided by $24$, it leaves the remainder of:\n\n$\\boxed{26 \\ mod 24 = 2}$",
    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Represent the three integers. \nLet the three integers be $a, b, c$. When these integers are divided by $24$, the remainders are $10, 4,$ and $12$ respectively. So we can write:\n\n$a = 24p + 10$  \n$b = 24q + 4$  \n$c = 24r + 12$  \n\nwhere $p, q,$ and $r$ are integers.\n\nStep 2: Find the sum of the three integers.\nThe sum of the three integers is $a + b + c$. We can substitute the expressions we found in Step 1:\n\n$a + b + c = (24p + 10) + (24q + 4) + (24r + 12)$  \n\nCombine like terms to get:\n\n$a + b + c = 24p + 24q + 24r + 26$  \n\nStep 3: Combine the multiples of 24 and find the remainder.\nWe can combine the multiples of 24 as follows:\n\n$24p + 24q + 24r = 24(p + q + r)$\n\nSo, \n\n$a + b + c = 24(p + q + r) + 26$  \n\nSince $24(p + q + r)$ is a multiple of 24, the remainder when $a + b + c$ is divided by 24 is the remainder when 26 is divided by 24.\n\nFinally, when 26 is divided by 24, the remainder is 2.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Let the three integers be $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$. \n\n2. We are given that when $x_1$ is divided by $24$, the remainder is $10$. So, we can write $x_1$ as $x_1 = 24a + 10$, where $a$ is a positive integer.\n\n3. Similarly, when $x_2$ is divided by $24$, the remainder is $4$. So, we can write $x_2$ as $x_2 = 24b + 4$, where $b$ is a positive integer.\n\n4. And, when $x_3$ is divided by $24$, the remainder is $12$. So, we can write $x_3$ as $x_3 = 24c + 12$, where $c$ is a positive integer.\n\n5. Now, let's find the sum of the three integers, which is $x_1 + x_2 + x_3$. Substituting the expressions for $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$, we get:\n\n$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = (24a + 10) + (24b + 4) + (24c + 12)$\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 24(a + b + c) + 26$\n\n6. Now, let's divide the sum by $24$ to find the remainder. We can write $26$ as $24 + 2$, so the sum becomes:\n\n$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 24(a + b + c) + 24 + 2$\n\nNow, we can factor out $24$ from the first two terms.\n\n$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 24(a + b + c + 1) + 2$\n\n7. When we divide $x_1 + x_2 + x_3$ by $24$, the first term is divisible by $24$ with a remainder of $0$, so it doesn't contribute to the remainder. The remainder comes from the second term, which is $2$.\n\nSo, the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$ is $\\boxed{2}$."
