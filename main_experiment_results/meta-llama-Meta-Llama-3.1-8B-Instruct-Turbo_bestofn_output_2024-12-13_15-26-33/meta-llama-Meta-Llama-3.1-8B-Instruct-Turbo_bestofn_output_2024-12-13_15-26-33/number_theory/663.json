    "To solve this problem, we need to consider the given equations in base-6. The first equation is ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$ and the second equation is ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$.\n\nFirst, let's focus on the first equation: ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$. \n\nTo add the numbers, we must remember that in base-6, the maximum digit value is $5$. When we add $B$ and $C$, the maximum value is $11$ in base-6, which equals $7$ in base-10. However, since we are in base-6, it is not possible for the sum of $B$ and $C$ to be both greater than $5$ without carrying. \n\nThe two possible sums in base-6 that meet these criteria are $B + C = 0$ or $B + C = 6$. However $B+C$ cannot be $0$ since we are told that all three numbers are non-zero. Therefore, $B + C = 6$.\n\nNow, let's consider the second equation: ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$.\n\nFor this equation, we need to keep in mind that $A$ and $B$ are distinct (different) digits, and the maximum value for either $A$ or $B$ is $5$. When adding two numbers with $A$ and $B$ in the units place, the sum will always be greater than $or equal to 7$. But the maximum value possible in base-6 is 13. So we need to consider that for the sum of these numbers to be ${CC_6}$ and we need the sum to be a two-digit number.\n\nSince we are trying to find ${ABC}$ and $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct, we know that $C > B$.\n\nNow, considering the equation $B + C = 6$, $C$ is $5$ and $B$ is $1$ is a combination that doesn't meet the requirement for $A$ and $B$ to be greater than $0$ and also when we plug it into the second equation, it also meets the requirements.\n\nSo we have C=5 and B=1.\n\nNow we plug in $B=1$ and $C=5$ into the second equation: ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$.\n\nIn this case, we have ${A1_6}+{1A_6}={55_6}$. We can add the ones place to get $1 + A = 5$ and the units place to get $A + 1 = 5$. We can solve for $A$ using either equation, and we get $A = 4$. \n\nTherefore, our three-digit number ${ABC}$ is $415$. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{415}$",
    "To solve this problem, we need to find the values of the digits $A$, $B$, and $C$. \n\nGiven that ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$, we can write this as:\n\n$6A + B + C = 6C + 0$\n\n$6A + B = 5C$\n\nSince $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct digits less than 6, let's analyze the possible values for $C$. \n\nWe can see that $C$ can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, since $6A + B = 5C$, we can see that $C$ must be even, because $6A$ will always be even, and $B$ (being less than 6) can be either even or odd. Therefore, the only possible options for $C$ are 2 and 4.\n\nLet's analyze the case when $C = 2$. Substituting $C = 2$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$6A + B = 10$\n\nSince $A$ and $B$ are less than 6, it's not possible for $6A + B$ to be equal to 10. Therefore, $C$ cannot be 2.\n\nNow, let's analyze the case when $C = 4$. Substituting $C = 4$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$6A + B = 20$\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n$6A + B = 6\\cdot4$\n\n$A + B/6 = 4$\n\nWe can see that $B$ must be 2, as it is the only option that will make $B/6$ an integer. \n\nSubstituting $B = 2$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$A + 2/6 = 4$\n\n$A + 1/3 = 4$\n\nMultiplying by 3 on both sides, we get:\n\n$3A + 1 = 12$\n\n$3A = 11$\n\n$A = 11/3$\n\nSince $A$ must be an integer, we can conclude that $C$ cannot be 4 when $A$ and $B$ are distinct digits less than 6.\n\nHowever, there was an initial mistake in considering how the numbers were being added. \n\nGiven that ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$ we can write this as:\n\n$6A+B+C=6C$\n\n$6A+B=5C$\n\nFrom the given information $C$ can be 2, 4, or 5. Since $A$ and $B$ are non-zero digits less than 6, we can conclude that $C$ cannot be 5.\n\nNow, let's analyze the case when $C = 2$. Substituting $C = 2$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$6A+B=10$\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n$6A+B=6\\cdot1+4$\n\n$A+B=1+4$\n\n$A+B=5$\n\nSince $A$ and $B$ are non-zero digits less than 6, we can conclude that the only possible option is $A = 4$ and $B = 1$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the case when $C = 4$. Substituting $C = 4$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$6A+B=20$\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n$6A+B=6\\cdot3+2$\n\n$A+B=3+2$\n\n$A+B=5$\n\nSince $A$ and $B$ are non-zero digits less than 6, we can conclude that the only possible option is $A = 2$ and $B = 3$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the case when $C = 5$. We can see that $6A+B=5C$ can be rewritten as:\n\n$6A+B=25$\n\n$A+B=25/6$\n\nHowever, $A+B$ will always be an integer, since both $A$ and $B$ are digits less than 6. Therefore, $C$ cannot be 5.\n\nHowever, if we analyze ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$ we can write this as:\n\n$(6A+B)+(6B+A)=6C+C$\n\n$7A+7B=7C$\n\n$A+B=C$\n\nSince $A+B=C$, we can conclude that the possible combination of $A$ and $B$ can be 2 and 3, 1 and 4 is not allowed as we already concluded that the only possible option is $C = 4$ when $A = 2$ and $B = 3$.\n\nHowever, we can analyze the equation $A+B=C$ to conclude that the possible combination of $A$ and $B$ can be 1 and 4 when $A+B=C$ can be rewritten as:\n\n$A+B=5$\n\nSince $C$ can be 1 and 5 when $A+B=C$, let's analyze the case when $C=5$, however, we've concluded that $C$ can't be 5 when analyzing $6A+B=5C$ which has been rewritten as $6A+B=25$ however, considering a different approach with $A+B=C$ and the given equation $since 1 and 5 cannot be a combination as 5 cannot be C. Therefore, the only possible combination is $A=1$ and $B=4$.\n\nWe can conclude that the only possible values for $A$, $B$, and $C$ are $A = 1$, $B = 4$, and $C = 5$.\n\nTherefore, the three-digit number ${ABC}$ is $\\boxed{145}$."
