    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of possible values for $r$ that are closest to $\\frac{2}{7}$.\n\nFirst, let's convert $\\frac{2}{7}$ to a decimal: \n\nWe can calculate the decimal expansion of $\\frac{2}{7}$ using long division. The result is: \n\n$0.\\overline{285714}$ \n\nNow, let's consider the possible four-place decimals $0.abcd$ that can approximate $r$. If the decimal expansion of $r$ starts with $0.0$, then the possible values of $r$ would be between $0.00256$ and $0.00285$. However, since $\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{28}\\approx 0.05069$ and $\\frac{1}{7}-\\frac{1}{28}\\approx 0.01786,$ all four-digit values $0.02cd$ with $c=0$ and $d\\geq3$ are farther from $\\frac{2}{7}$ than the closest fraction $\\frac12+\\frac{1}{28}$ or $\\frac{1}{7}-\\frac{1}{28}$. We also have to remove all possible four-digit values $0.02cd$ with $d\\geq3$, $c=0.$\n\nNext, we'll consider possible values of $r$ between $0.2800$ and $0.2850$. If the decimal expansion starts with $0.2$, then the closest fraction, $\\frac27$, would be the closest fraction to $r$ as long as $r$ is in the range $0.2800$ to $0.2850$. \n\nHowever, we must ensure that $r$ is closer to $\\frac{2}{7}$ than the fractions with numerators 1. The closest fractions with a numerator of 1 to $0.28$ are $\\frac{1}{4}$, where $0.25=0.25.$ Here, we'll only take the $d=0$ to $c\\leq 2$ since all values with $d > 2$ and $c \\le 2$ would, like our $d \\ge 3$ values, work for numerators 2 at higher values. We also note that $\\frac14$ is farther than $\\frac 2 7$ from values reached at $0.285.$\n\nApplying this procedure to the $0.28d$ case, we obtain the set: $[0.28333, 0.28385, 0.28350, 0.28354, 0.28359, 0.28363, 0.28367, 0.28371, 0.28375, 0.28379, 0.28125, 0.28129, 0.28133, 0.28137, 0.28141],.$ Here, $0.28125\\leq \\frac{1}{4}+\\frac12$ and $0.28375>\\frac12+\\frac{1}{28}.$ Values in square brackets satisfy the condition.\nWe further exclude any $d \\geq 4$ from our four-digit decimal $r$.\n\nAdding the above two cases gives $\\boxed{15}$",
    "To find the possible values of $r$, we need to consider the fractions that are closest to $\\frac{27}{8} = 3.375$ and have a numerator of 1 or 2 and a denominator of an integer. \n\nThe closest fractions are $\\frac{2}{7}$ and the figures immediately above and below it: $\\frac{2}{6}$ and $\\frac{3}{7}$\n\nTo find the range of values that make $\\frac{2}{7}$ closer to $r$ than the other fractions, we need to find the values of $r$ where $\\frac{2}{7} < r < \\frac{3}{7}$ or $\\frac{2}{6} < r < \\frac{2}{7}$\n\nFor the first case: to find the upper bound, we solve $\\frac{2}{7} < \\frac{27}{8} - \\delta$, and for the second case, we solve $\\frac{2}{6} < \\frac{27}{8} - \\delta$ for the lower bound.
