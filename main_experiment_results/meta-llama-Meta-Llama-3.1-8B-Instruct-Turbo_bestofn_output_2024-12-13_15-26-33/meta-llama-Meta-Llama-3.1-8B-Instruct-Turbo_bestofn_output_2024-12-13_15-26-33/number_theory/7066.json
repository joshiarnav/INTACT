    "To find the largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k$, we need to find the number of factors of $3$ in the product of the first $100$ positive odd integers. \n\nFirst, let's express $P$ in terms of factorials:\n\n$P = 1 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times ... \\times 199$\n\n$P = \\frac{1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times ... \\times 200}{2 \\times 4 \\times 6 \\times ... \\times 200}$\n\nSimplifying the above expression, we get:\n\n$P = \\frac{200!}{2^{100} \\times 100!}$\n\nNow, let's count the factors of $3$ in the product $P$. We can use the floor function $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ to count the number of multiples of $3$ in a given range.\n\nThere are $\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{200}{9} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{200}{27} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{200}{81} \\rfloor = 66 + 22 + 7 + 2 = 97$ multiples of $3$ in the range $1$ to $200$.\n\nSince each multiple of $3$ contributes a factor of $3$, the number of factors of $3$ contributed by the range $1$ to $200$ is $97$.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the factors of $3$ contributed by the range $201$ to $200$. As this range is empty, there are zero factors of $3$ contributed by it.\n\nNow, let's consider the factors of $3$ in the range $1$ to $100$. There are $\\lfloor \\frac{100}{3} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{100}{9} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{100}{27} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{100}{81} \\rfloor = 33 + 11 + 3 + 1 = 48$ multiples of $3$ in the range $1$ to $100$.\n\nSince each multiple of $3$ contributes a factor of $3$, the number of factors of $3$ contributed by the range $1$ to $100$ is $48$.\n\nHowever, we need to remove $100$ from the range $1$ to $100$, as we're considering the first $100$ positive odd integers, not the first $100$ positive integers. Since there is one number $100$ that has been counted twice, we need to subtract one.\n\nSo, the correct number of factors of $3$ contributed by the range $1$ to $100$ is $47$.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of factors of $3$ contributed by the range $1$ to $100$ from the number of factors of $3$ contributed by the range $1$ to $200$ to get the number of factors of $3$ in the product $P$:\n\n$97 - 47 = 50$\n\nThe largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k$ is therefore $\\boxed{50}$.",

The last group has only two integers, but 3 is still a factor of the product, so it contributes one more factor of 3.\n\nHowever, some of these groups will have additional factors of 3. For example, in the group $\\{9, 11, 13\\}$, 9 is a multiple of 3 with two factors of 3:\n\n$$9 = 3 \\cdot 3.$$\n\nThis means that this group contributes two factors of 3, rather than just one.\n\nTo count the total number of factors of 3, we need to count the number of factors of 3 contributed by each group and then sum them up.\n\nThere are 66 groups of three consecutive integers. Each of these groups contributes at least one factor of 3.\n\nIn addition to the groups that contribute a single factor of 3, there are some groups that contribute two or three factors of 3.\n\nThese groups occur whenever there is a multiple of 3 that has more than one factor of 3 (i.e., $3^2$, $3^3$, $3^4$, $3^5$, or $3^6$).\n\nThe multiples of $3^2$ that occur between 1 and 199 are:\n\n$9, 27, 45, 63, 81, 99, 117, 135, 153, 171, 189, 207$\n\nHowever, $207$ exceeds 199, so we consider only the first 11 multiples of 3^2.\n\nThe same occurs for other occurrences.\n\nCounting the number of factors of 3 contributed by each group, we get:\n\n- 66 groups contributing one factor of 3\n- 22 groups contributing two factors of 3 (corresponding to the 2 factors of 3 in the multiples of 9)\n- 7 groups contributing three factors of 3 (corresponding to the 3 factors of 3 in the multiples of 27)\n\nNow, summing up the contributions from all these groups, we get:\n\n$66 + 44 + 21 = 131$\n\nThis is the total number of factors of 3 in the product of the first 100 positive odd integers.\n\nTherefore, the largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k$ is $\\boxed{131}.$"
