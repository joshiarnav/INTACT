    "To find the integer $n$ such that $n \\equiv -3737 \\pmod{8}$, we need to find the remainder when -3737 is divided by 8. \n\nFirst, we can calculate the remainder of 3737 when divided by 8. \n\n3737 \u00f7 8 = 467 remainder 1 \n\nNow, since we are asked to find the remainder when -3737 is divided by 8, we can simply change the sign of the remainder. \n\n-3737 \u00f7 8 = -467 remainder -1 = 8-1 \n\nHowever, in modular arithmetic, the answer should be between 0 and 7 inclusive, so we need to add 8 to -1 to get the correct remainder. \n\n-1 + 8 = 7\n\nSo, the value of $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, let's analyze both solutions for correctness and clarity.\n\nSolution 1:\n- The solution starts by finding the remainder of 3737 when divided by 8, which is a good approach.\n- However, it incorrectly states that changing the sign of the remainder gives the correct remainder for -3737.\n- The solution then correctly adds 8 to -1 to get the remainder within the specified range.\n\nSolution 2:\n- The solution starts by directly finding the remainder of -3737 when divided by 8, which is a more straightforward approach.\n- The solution correctly calculates the remainder and adds 8 to -1 to get the remainder within the specified range.\n\nBoth solutions arrive at the same answer, but Solution 2 is more straightforward and easier to understand. Therefore, the best solution is Solution 2.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is 2.",
