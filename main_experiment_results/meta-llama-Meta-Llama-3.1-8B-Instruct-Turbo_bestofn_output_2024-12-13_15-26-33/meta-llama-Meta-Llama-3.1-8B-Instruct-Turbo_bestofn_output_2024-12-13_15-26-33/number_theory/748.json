    "To find the value of $a$, we can start by setting up an equation using the given information.\n\nThe fraction $\\frac{a}{a+27}$ equals $0.865$, which can be written as $\\frac{a}{a+27} = \\frac{865}{1000}$.\n\nWe can then cross multiply to get:\n\n$1000a = 865(a + 27)$\n\nNow, we can expand and solve for $a$:\n\n$1000a = 865a + 23355$\n\nSubtracting $865a$ from both sides:\n\n$135a = 23355$\n\nDividing both sides by 135:\n\n$a = \\frac{23355}{135}$\n\nNow, let's simplify the fraction:\n\n$a = 173$\n\nSo, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{173}.$",
    "To find the value of $a$, we can set up the equation $\\frac{a}{a+27} = 0.865$.\n\nStep 1: Convert the decimal 0.865 to a fraction. \n\nWe can write 0.865 as a fraction by writing it as $\\frac{0.865 \\times 1000}{1000} = \\frac{865}{1000}$.\n\nStep 2: Simplify the fraction $\\frac{865}{1000}$.\n\nThe fraction $\\frac{865}{1000}$ can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 865 and 1000 is 5. \n\nSo, $\\frac{865}{1000} = \\frac{865 \\div 5}{1000 \\div 5} = \\frac{173}{200}$.\n\nStep 3: Rewrite the equation with the simplified fraction.\n\n$\\frac{a}{a+27} = \\frac{173}{200}$.\n\nStep 4: Cross-multiply the fractions.\n\n$a \\times 200 = (a + 27) \\times 173$.\n\nStep 5: Expand the equation and combine like terms.\n\n$200a = 173a + 4661$.\n\nStep 6: Isolate the variable $a$.\n\n$200a - 173a = 4661$.\n\n$27a = 4661$.\n\nStep 7: Solve for $a$.\n\n$a = \\frac{4661}{27}$.\n\n$a \\approx 173.00$.\n\nSince $a$ must be a positive integer, we can see that the approximation is very close to the exact value.\n\nSo, the value of $a$ is approximately $\\boxed{173}$.",
    "To find the value of $a$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. We are given the equation $\\frac{a}{a+27} = 0.865$. To get rid of the decimal, we can convert it to a fraction. \n\nMultiply and divide 0.865 by 1000 (i.e., 10^3) to get a whole number in the denominator.\n$0.865 = \\frac{865}{1000}$\n\n2. Replace 0.865 with the equivalent fraction $\\frac{865}{1000}$ in the original equation:\n$\\frac{a}{a+27} = \\frac{865}{1000}$\n\n3. Cross-multiply the fractions:\n$1000a = 865a + 23355$\n\n4. Subtract $865a$ from both sides to get:\n$135a = 23355$\n\n5. Divide both sides by 135 to isolate $a$:\n$a = \\frac{23355}{135}$\n\n6. Calculate the value of a by dividing 23355 by 135:\n$a = 173$\n\nThe value of $a$ is $\\boxed{173}$."
