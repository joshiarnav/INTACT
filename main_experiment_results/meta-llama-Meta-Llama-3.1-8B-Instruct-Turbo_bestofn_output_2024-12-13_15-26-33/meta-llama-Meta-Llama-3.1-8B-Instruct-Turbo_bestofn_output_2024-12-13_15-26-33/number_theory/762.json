    "To find the units digit of $n$, we need to consider the units digit of the product $mn$. \n\n1. First, we need to determine the units digit of $21^6$.\nSince 21 ends with 1, we raise 1 to the power of 6:\n $1^6 = 1$ \nSo, the units digit of $21^6$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\n2. Now we know that $mn$ has a units digit of 1 and we know that $m$ has a units digit of 7. \nTo find the units digit of $n$, we need to find the number $k$ such that $7k$ ends with 1.\n\nWe can test the possible units digits of $k$ (which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) by multiplying them with 7:\n- $7 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n- $7 \\cdot 1 = 7$\n- $7 \\cdot 2 = 14$ \n- $7 \\cdot 3 = 21$\n- $7 \\cdot 4 = 28$\n- $7 \\cdot 5 = 35$\n- $7 \\cdot 6 = 42$\n- $7 \\cdot 7 = 49$\n- $7 \\cdot 8 = 56$\n- $7 \\cdot 9 = 63$\n\nWe see that $7 \\cdot 3 = 21$, so the units digit of $n$ is $3$. \n\nSo the final answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "To find the units digit of $n$, we need to first determine the units digit of $21^6$.\n\nThe units digit of $21$ is $1$, and the units digit of any number that is a power of $21$ will depend on the units digit of the power. Since $21$ ends in $1$, the units digit of $21$ raised to any power will also end in $1$.\n\nSo the units digit of $21^6$ is $1$.\n\nSince the units digit of $mn$ is $1$ and the units digit of $m$ is $7$, we can set up the following multiplication:\n\n$7 \\times 3 = 21$\n\n$7 \\times 7 = 49$\n\n$7 \\times 9 = 63$\n\nSince $7 \\times 3 = 21$, we can deduce that the units digit of $n$ must end in $3$.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $n$ is $\\boxed{3}$. \n\nThis is the solution to the problem.",
    "To find the units digit of n, we need to first find the units digit of $21^6$.\n\nStep 1: Find the units digit of $21^6$.\n\nThe units digit of $21^6$ is the same as the units digit of $1^6$, which is 1.\n\nStep 2: Since $m$ has a units digit of 7, and the product $mn$ has a units digit of 1, we can write the equation: 7 * n \u2261 1 (mod 10).\n\nStep 3: Solve the modular equation 7 * n \u2261 1 (mod 10).\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to find an integer n such that 7n has the same remainder as 1 when divided by 10. \n\nIn the modular arithmetic, the multiplication is closed under modulo 10, and the product of 7 with another number will be 7 times another number under modulo 10. In order to find we need to look at:\n\n7 x 1 = 7 (mod 10)\n7 x 2 = 14 \u2261 4 (mod 10)\n7 x 3 = 21 \u2261 1 (mod 10)\n\nBy analyzing this pattern, the product 7n \u2261 1 (mod 10) is satisfied when n \u2261 3 (mod 10), therefore the units digit of n is 3.\n\nSo, the units digit of n is $\\boxed{3}$."

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 3. \n\nHere's why: \n\nSolution 3 uses modular arithmetic to solve the problem in a straightforward and efficient way. It directly addresses the problem by setting up the modular equation 7 * n \u2261 1 (mod 10) and solving for n. \n\nSolution 1 and Solution 2 both involve trial and error to find the units digit of n. While they eventually arrive at the correct answer, they are less elegant and more time-consuming than Solution 3.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is 3.",
  "solution": "The units digit of $mn$ is $1^6 = 1$.  Searching for a units digit for $n$ (which is clearly odd), we find that $7 \\cdot 3 = 1$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit of $n$.",
