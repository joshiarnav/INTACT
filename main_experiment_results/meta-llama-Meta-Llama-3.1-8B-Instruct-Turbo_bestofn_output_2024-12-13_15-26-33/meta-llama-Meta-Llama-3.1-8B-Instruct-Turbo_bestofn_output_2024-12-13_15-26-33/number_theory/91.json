    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nGiven that when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6, we can write the equation: \n\n60 = $q \\cdot k^2$ + 6  \nwhere $q$ is the quotient.\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n54 = $q \\cdot k^2$\n\nSince 54 is a multiple of $k^2$, we need to find the factors of 54 that can be expressed as $k^2$. The prime factorization of 54 is:\n54 = 3 * 3 * 6\n\nPossible values for $k$ can be derived from these factors, but since we're looking for $k^2$, we consider the perfect squares:\n$k^2$ = 9 or $k^2$ = 36\n\nThus, the possible values of $k$ are:\n$k$ = 3 (since 3*3 = 9) or $k$ = 6 (since 6*6 = 36)\n\nNow, let's consider the remainders when 100 is divided by these possible values of $k$. \n\n1. If $k$ = 3:\n   100 / 3 = 33 with a remainder of 1\n\n2. If $k$ = 6:\n   100 / 6 = 16 with a remainder of 4\n\nTherefore, when 100 is divided by 3, the remainder is $\\boxed{1}$",
    "To find the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$, we need to find the value of $k$ first.\n\nWe are given that when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. This can be written as:\n\n$$60 = a \\times k^2 + 6$$\n\nwhere $a$ is a non-negative integer.\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides gives:\n\n$$54 = a \\times k^2$$\n\nSince $k^2$ divides 54, we know that $k^2$ must be a factor of 54.\n\nThe factors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54.\n\nHowever, $k$ is a positive integer, so $k^2$ must be a perfect square.\n\nThe perfect squares that are factors of 54 are: 1 and 9.\n\nThis means that $k^2$ can be either 1 or 9.\n\nIf $k^2 = 1$, then $k$ would be 1, but $k$ cannot be 1 because the remainder of 60 divided by 1 is not 6.\n\nTherefore, $k^2 = 9$, and $k$ is 3.\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$.\n\nWhen 100 is divided by 3, the quotient is 33 and the remainder is 1.\n\nSo, the answer is: $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "When 60 is divided by $k^2$ and the remainder is 6, we can represent this situation as an equation: \n\n$60 = qk^2 + 6$\n\nWhere $q$ is the quotient of the division.\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can subtract 6 from both sides:\n\n$54 = qk^2$\n\nNow, we notice that $54$ can be factored as $6 \\times 9$, and since $k^2$ is being multiplied by $q$ to get $54$, $k^2$ must be a factor of $54$.\n\nPossible factors of $54$ are $1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.$ Since $k^2$ cannot be $1$ (as $k = 1$ would not produce a remainder when dividing $60$ by $k^2$), we must consider the remaining factors as possible values for $k^2$.\n\nHowever, we should consider perfect squares among these factors because $k^2$ must be a perfect square.\n\nThe perfect squares in the list are $1, 9, 36, 81, 54.$ However $1$ is not valid and $54$ equals to $6 times 9.$ We can observe that both 9 and 36 are factors of 54.\n\nThus, the possible values for $k^2$ are $9$ and $36$. \n\nThus, the possible values of $k$ are $3$ and $6.$\n\nHowever, $k$ cannot be $6$ because 60 divided by 6 squared equals 2.5 and 2.5 is not an integer. As an integer quotient must be obtained, $k$ must be $3$. \n\nWith this, we can find the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$:\n\n $100$ $= $ q\\_k $+ r\\_k $ implies that $q\\_k $= $ integer\\_quotient $ and $r\\_k $=$ remainder $.\n\n To find the remainder $r_k$, we can represent 100 as a multiple of $k$ plus a remainder $r_k$, and then subtract the multiple of $k$ from 100:\n\n$ 100 - 3 \\cdot 33 = 100 - 99 = 1 $.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$ is $\\boxed{1}$."

  "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$.
