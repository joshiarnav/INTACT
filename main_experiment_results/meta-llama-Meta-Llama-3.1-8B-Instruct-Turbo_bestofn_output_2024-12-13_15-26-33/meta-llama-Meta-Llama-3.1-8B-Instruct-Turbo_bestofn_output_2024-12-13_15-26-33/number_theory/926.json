    "To find the integer $n$, we need to find the remainder when 7882 is divided by 5.\n\nStep 1: Divide 7882 by 5.\n\n7882 divided by 5 equals 1576 with a remainder of 2.\n\nStep 2: The integer $n$ is the number that is equivalent to 7882 modulo 5. We have found this to be 2.\n\nStep 3: The remainder of 2 that we found is an integer itself, it is between 4 and 8, inclusive. Therefore, we have found our integer n.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
    "First, we need to find the remainder when 7882 is divided by 5. \n\nTo do this, we can use the modulo operation: 7882 mod 5 = 2. \n\nSo, 7882 is congruent to 2 modulo 5, i.e., 7882 \u2261 2 (mod 5).\n\nNow, we are looking for an integer n such that n \u2261 7882 (mod 5).\n\nThis is equivalent to n \u2261 2 (mod 5) since 7882 \u2261 2 (mod 5).\n\nThe integers n that satisfy n \u2261 2 (mod 5) are of the form n = 5k + 2, where k is an integer.\n\nSince 4 \u2264 n \u2264 8, we need to find the value of k that gives us an integer n in this range.\n\nWe can set up the following inequalities:\n\n4 \u2264 5k + 2\n8 \u2265 5k + 2\n\nSimplifying these inequalities, we get:\n\n2 \u2264 5k\n5k \u2264 6\n\nSince 5k must be an integer, we need to find the integers k that satisfy these inequalities.\n\nFor 2 \u2264 5k, we can divide both sides by 5 to get k \u2265 2/5. However, since k is an integer, we can conclude that k \u2265 1.\n\nFor 5k \u2264 6, we can divide both sides by 5 to get k \u2264 6/5. However, since k is an integer, we can conclude that k \u2264 1.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value of k is k = 1, since k is an integer and 1 \u2264 k \u2264 1 is the only solution to the two inequalities above.\n\nNow, we can substitute k = 1 into n = 5k + 2 to get n = 5(1) + 2 = 7.\n\nSo, the solution is n = 7. \n\nThe answer is  $\\boxed{7}$.",
