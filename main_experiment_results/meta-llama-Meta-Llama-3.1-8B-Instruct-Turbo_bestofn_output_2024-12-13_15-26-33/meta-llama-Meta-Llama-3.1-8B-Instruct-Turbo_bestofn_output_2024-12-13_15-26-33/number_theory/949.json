    "To find the value of $a$ and $m$, we first need to solve the congruence equation $8x+1\\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nStep 1: Subtract 1 from both sides:\n$8x\\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides by 4:\n$2x\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$\n\nWe can simplify this further by multiplying both sides by the multiplicative inverse of $2$ modulo $3$, which is $2$ itself. \n\nStep 3: Multiply both sides by 2:\n$4x\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ reduces to $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$.\n\nSince we know that x is congruent to 2 modulo 3, we can determine that $a=2$ and $m=3$.\n\nStep 4: Add $a$ and $m$ together to get the final answer:\n$a+m = 2+3 = 5$\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",

To do this, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 8 modulo 12. Since 8 and 12 are not coprime (they have a common factor of 4), we cannot directly find the multiplicative inverse.

    "To solve the given congruence, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 1 from both sides of the congruence: \n   $8x+1 - 1 \\equiv 5 - 1 \\pmod{12}$\n   This simplifies to:\n   $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$\n\n2. We need to find the modular inverse of 8 modulo 12 to get x by itself on one side of the equation. However, first we must divide the left and right sides of the congruence by the greatest common divisor between 8 and 12. We find that gcd(8,12) is 4.\n\n3. Divide both sides by the gcd(8,12), 4, to get:\n   $(8x)/4 \\equiv 4/4 \\pmod{12/4}$\n   This simplifies to:\n   $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$\n\n4. Now we find the modular inverse of 2 modulo 3. The modular inverse is the number which, when multiplied by 2 and taken mod 3, gives 1. In this case, the modular inverse of 2 mod 3 is 2 since $(2\\times2)\\bmod{3} = 1$. Multiply both sides of the congruence by the modular inverse of 2, which is 2, to get:\n   $2x \\times 2 \\equiv 1 \\times 2 \\pmod{3}$\n   This simplifies to:\n   $4x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$\n\n5. Again, divide both sides of the congruence by gcd(4,3), 1, which we can ignore this time because the gcd is 1. Then simplify to get:\n   $x \\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$\n\nThe congruence is now in the desired form $x \\equiv a\\pmod{m}$ where $a = 2$ and $m = 3$. So, the sum of $a$ and $m$ is $a + m = 2 + 3 = \\boxed{5}$."

  "solution": "Subtract 1 from both sides to obtain $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$. Add 12 to the right-hand side to get $8x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{12}$.
