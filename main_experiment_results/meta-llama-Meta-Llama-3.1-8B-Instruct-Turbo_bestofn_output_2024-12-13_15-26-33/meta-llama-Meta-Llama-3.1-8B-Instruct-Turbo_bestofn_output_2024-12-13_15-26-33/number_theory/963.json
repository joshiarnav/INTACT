    "To find the values that the two arithmetic progressions have in common, we need to find the numbers that are present in both sequences. \n\nThe first sequence is given by $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$ with a common difference of $3$ ($5-2=3$). \n\nThe second sequence is given by $\\{3, 10, 17, 24, \\ldots\\}$ with a common difference of $7$ ($10-3=7$). \n\nAny value in the two sequences must be of the form $2 + 3n$ (for some integer $n$) and $3 + 7m$ (for some integer $m$).\n\nNow, let's express the $3+7m$ sequence in a form closer to $2+3n$, to see if we can apply them to a common set and easily remove common content: When $m = 1$, $3 + 7 \\cdot 1 = 10$, and then when $m = 2$, $3 + 7 \\cdot 2 = 17$. \n\nWe notice a pattern in $7m-3$: For any integer value of $m$, we can write: $$7m-3=3(2m+1)-3$$And when we expand the original expression for some values of $m$, we find that: $$7m-3 = 3 \\cdot (2m + 1) - 3.$$But now we get a new form that resembles the first term $2+3n$: $$3\\cdot(2m + 1)=3\\cdot(2(m+1)-1)=2\\cdot3(m+1)-3.$$  Then, using this form, we are able to express the second given sequence $\\{3+7m\\}$ in the same form of $2+3n$. \n\nWe've found that we can write the second arithmetic sequence in this form: \n$2(2m+1) + 3(-1) = 2\\cdot3m+3(-1)+3=3(2\\cdot m+1)-3$, using the substitution that $m$. $=m+1-1$, we now get this next expression $$3\\cdot(2\\cdot(m+1)-1)$$. \n\nExpress the second arithmetic progression, $\\{3, 10, 17, 24, \\ldots\\}$; in the form $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$ to find the common values: $$3+7m=3\\cdot(2\\cdot(m+1)-1).$$  The fact is that the set $\\{3,10,17,24,\\ldots \\}$ can be rewritten as: $$3+7m=3\\cdot(2m+^{}+1)-3 \\;\\text{and}\\;\\; 3\\cdot(2\\cdot(m-1)+1).$$\n\n$$\\text{Set 2, }\\text{values can be written in the form}\\;\\; 3\\cdot(2\\cdot(m+1)-1).$$ \n\nWe now have a set with two different forms to express values of the first set and the original second set. \n\nThese two sets form now into a single set that we can use to find common values between your two sequences. \n\nWe've expressed both arithmetic sequences in the form $2+3n$. So now we can combine the two sets into one set to find their common values:\n\nSet 1: $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$ (common difference of 3)\n\nSet 2: $\\{2^{}+3\\cdot(m+1-1),2^{}+3\\cdot(2\\cdot(m-1)+1)\\} = \\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$ (common difference of $3\\cdot(2\\cdot(m-1)+1)$)\n\nCombining the two sets, we get the set $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots^{}-1\\}$\n\nNow we understand that this can be represented as $2+3n$ for any $n$ value.\n\n\nYou have 2 arithmetic sequences with common difference of 3 \n\n$2+3n$\n\nand\n\n$2+3\\cdot(2\\cdot(m-1)+1)$ is the same as the second sequence, so \n\n$2+3(2\\cdot(m-1)+1)$ is the same as the form $2+3n$\n\nin the two sequences, the common values are \n\n$2, 5, 8, 11, 14,$ etc.\n\nOur goal now is to find the largest value less than 500 that they have in common. \n\nUsing the form $2 + 3n$, we can write the common values as $2 + 3(1), 2 + 3(2), 2 + 3(3), \\dots$. To find the largest value less than 500, we can find the largest value of $n$ such that $2 + 3n < 500$.\n\nSolve this inequality:\n\n$$2 + 3n < 500.$$\n\n$$3n<498\\; \\text{and}\\; n<\\frac{498}{3}=166$$\n\nSince we are looking for the largest integer value of $n$, we can find the largest integer less than 166, which is 165.\n\nNow we can plug this value of $n$ into the expression $2 + 3n$ to find the largest value less than 500 that the two sequences have in common:\n\n$$2 + 3(165) = 2 + 495 = 497$$\n\nTherefore, the largest value less than 500 that the two sequences have in common is $\\boxed{497}$",
