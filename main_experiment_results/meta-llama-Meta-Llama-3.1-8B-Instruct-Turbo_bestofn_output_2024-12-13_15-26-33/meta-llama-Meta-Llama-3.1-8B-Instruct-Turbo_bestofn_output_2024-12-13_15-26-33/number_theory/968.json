    "To start solving the problem, we need to understand that a number having exactly three natural-number factors means that it is a square of a prime number. This is because a prime number has two factors: 1 and itself, and when we square it, we get a new number with factors 1, the prime number itself, and the square of the prime number.\n\nSo, let's assume that $x=a^{2}$, $y=b^{2}$, and $z=c^{2}$ where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are distinct prime numbers.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$. We can write it as:\n$x^{2}y^{3}z^{4} = (a^{2})^{2}(b^{2})^{3}(c^{2})^{4}$\n$= a^{4}b^{6}c^{8}$\n\nA number of the form $a^{m}b^{n}c^{o}$ has $(m+1)(n+1)(o+1)$ factors. Therefore, the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ is:\n$(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)$\n$= 5 \\times 7 \\times 9$\n$= 315$\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{315}$.",

    "To find the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$, let's start by understanding what it means for a number to have exactly three natural-number factors. \n\nA natural number $n$ has exactly three factors if and only if it is the square of a prime number. This means that the only factors of $n$ are $1$, the prime number $p$ itself, and $p^2$. \n\nFor example, $2^2$ (which equals $4$) has exactly three factors: $1$, $2$, and $4$. \n\nNow, let's examine the prime factorization of $x$, $y$, and $z$. Let's say $x=p_1^a$, $y=p_2^b$, and $z=p_3^c$. We know that to get exactly three factors, we need to have each exponent equal to $2$ (i.e., $a=2$, $b=2$, and $c=2$).\n\nSo we can write $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$.\n\nNow, let's look at the prime factorization of $x^2y^3z^4$:\n\n$$x^2y^3z^4=p_1^{2 \\cdot 2}p_2^{3 \\cdot 2}p_3^{4 \\cdot 2}=p_1^{4}p_2^{6}p_3^{8}$$\n\nTo find the number of factors of $x^2y^3z^4$, we use the formula for the number of factors of a number: $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)(e_3+\\cdots)$ where $e_1,e_2,e_3,\\ldots$ are the exponents of the prime factors. \n\nIn this case, the number of factors of $x^2y^3z^4$ is $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=5\\cdot7\\cdot9=\\boxed{315}$."

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe reason is that Solution 1 presents the information in a clear and concise manner, and the steps are easy to follow. The solution also uses a clear and concise notation, which makes it easy to understand.\n\nSolution 2 and Solution 3 are very similar to Solution 1, and they present the same information in a slightly different way. However, Solution 1 is still the best solution because it is the most concise and easiest to follow.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is 1.",
  "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",
