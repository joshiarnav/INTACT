    "To find the units digit of $F_{1000} = 2^{2^{1000}} + 1$, let's analyze the pattern of units digits of powers of 2.\n\n1. $2^1 = 2$ \n2. $2^2 = 4$\n3. $2^3 = 8$\n4. $2^4 = 16$ which has a units digit of 6\n5. $2^5 = 32$ which has a units digit of 2\n6. $2^6 = 64$ which has a units digit of 4\n7. $2^7 = 128$ which has a units digit of 8\n8. $2^8 = 256$ which has a units digit of 6\n\nWe see the units digits of powers of 2 repeat in a pattern: 2, 4, 8, 6. Let's analyze this pattern:\n\n- The pattern repeats every 4 powers.\n- The first power in the pattern is 2, so we can say that the units digit of $2^n$ is determined by the remainder when $n$ is divided by 4.\n\nFor $2^{2^{1000}}$:\n- When $2^{1000}$ is divided by 4, it leaves a remainder of 0 (since $2^{1000}$ is an even number).\n- This means that the exponent $2^{1000}$ is a multiple of 4, and the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ will be the last number in the repeating pattern, which is 6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6.\n\nSince the units digit of $F_{1000} = 2^{2^{1000}} + 1$ will be 1 more than the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$, we get:\n\nThe units digit of $F_{1000} = 6 + 1 = \\boxed{7}$",
    "To find the units digit of $F_{1000}$, we first need to notice that we don't actually need to calculate the entire number.\n\nLet's consider the pattern of units digits of $2^n$.\n\n- For $n=1$, $2^n = 2$, so the units digit is $2$.\n- For $n=2$, $2^n = 4$, so the units digit is $4$.\n- For $n=3$, $2^n = 8$, so the units digit is $8$.\n- For $n=4$, $2^n = 16$, so the units digit is $6$.\n- For $n=5$, $2^n = 32$, so the units digit is $2$.\n\nWe see that the pattern of units digits repeats every $4$ powers:\n\n2, 4, 8, 6, ...\n\nNow, let's consider $2^n$ for n = 1000.  Since the pattern repeats every 4 powers, we can find the units digit by looking at the remainder when 1000 is divided by 4.\n\n1000 divided by 4 is 250 with a remainder of 0. This means the units digit of $2^{1000}$ corresponds to the 4th element in the pattern (remember we start counting from 0), which is 6.\n\nNow, looking at the original formula for $F_n$, we have $F_n=2^{2^n} + 1$. In this case, n = 1000.\n\nSo, $F_{1000} = 2^{2^{1000}} + 1$. Since $2^{2^{1000}}$ has a units digit of 6, the units digit of $F_{1000}$ will be $6+1 = 7$.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $F_{1000}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "To find the units digit of $F_{1000}$, we can look for a pattern in the units digits of powers of 2. \n\nWhen you calculate the powers of 2, you'll get the following patterns for the units digits:\n\n- $2^1$ = 2 (units digit: 2)\n- $2^2$ = 4 (units digit: 4)\n- $2^3$ = 8 (units digit: 8)\n- $2^4$ = 16 (units digit: 6)\n- $2^5$ = 32 (units digit: 2)\n- $2^6$ = 64 (units digit: 4)\n- $2^7$ = 128 (units digit: 8)\n- ...\n\nWe can observe a cycle of 4 in the units digits of powers of 2: 2, 4, 8, 6.\n\nSince the cycle repeats every 4 powers, we can find the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ by finding the remainder of $2^{1000}$ when divided by 4.\n\nTo do this, consider the last two digits of $2^n$.
