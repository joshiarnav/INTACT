    "To express $0.\\overline{3}+0.\\overline{2}$ as a common fraction, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Express $0.\\overline{3}$ and $0.\\overline{2}$ as fractions:\n- $0.\\overline{3}$ can be expressed as $0.\\overline{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$ because the repeating digit is 3 and it has one digit.\n- $0.\\overline{2}$ can be expressed as $0.\\overline{2} = \\frac{2}{9}$ because the repeating digit is 2 and it has one digit.\n\n2. Now, add the two fractions:\n$\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9}$. \n\nTo add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 9 in this case.\n\n3. Convert $\\frac{1}{3}$ to have a denominator of 9:\n$\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1 \\times 3}{3 \\times 3} = \\frac{3}{9}$.\n\n4. Now add the fractions:\n$\\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{3+2}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$.\n\nTherefore, $0.\\overline{3}+0.\\overline{2}$ expressed as a common fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$.",
    "To express $0.\\overline{3}+0.\\overline{2}$ as a common fraction, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. First, we need to convert $0.\\overline{3}$ and $0.\\overline{2}$ into fractions. \n\nWe can represent $0.\\overline{3}$ as a fraction by letting $x = 0.\\overline{3}$. Multiplying $x$ by $10$, we get $10x = 3.\\overline{3}$.\n\nSince the repeating part starts after the decimal point, we can subtract $x$ from $10x$ to remove the repeating part. This gives us $10x - x = 3.\\overline{3} - 0.\\overline{3}$.\n\nThe result is $9x = 3$, and solving for $x$ gives us $x = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSimilarly, we can represent $0.\\overline{2}$ as a fraction. Let $y = 0.\\overline{2}$. Multiplying $y$ by $10$, we get $10y = 2.\\overline{2}$.\n\nSubtracting $y$ from $10y$ to remove the repeating part, we get $10y - y = 2.\\overline{2} - 0.\\overline{2}$.\n\nThe result is $9y = 2$, and solving for $y$ gives us $y = \\frac{2}{9}$.\n\n2. Now that we have $0.\\overline{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$ and $0.\\overline{2} = \\frac{2}{9}$, we can add them together.\n\n$0.\\overline{3} + 0.\\overline{2} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9}$\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of $3$ and $9$ is $9$, so we can rewrite $\\frac{1}{3}$ as $\\frac{3}{9}$.\n\n$\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{3 + 2}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$.",
    "To express the given repeating decimals as a common fraction, we'll first convert $0.\\overline{3}$ and $0.\\overline{2}$ to fractions.\n\nStep 1: Converting $0.\\overline{3}$ to a fraction\nLet $x = 0.\\overline{3}$. Multiplying both sides by 10, we get $10x = 3.\\overline{3}$. Now, subtracting $x$ from $10x$, we have:\n$10x - x = 3.\\overline{3} - 0.\\overline{3}$\n$9x = 3$\n$x = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nStep 2: Converting $0.\\overline{2}$ to a fraction\nLet $y = 0.\\overline{2}$.

Now, subtracting $y$ from $10y$, we have:\n$10y - y = 2.\\overline{2} - 0.\\overline{2}$\n$9y = 2$\n$y = \\frac{2}{9}$\n\nStep 3: Finding the sum of $0.\\overline{3}$ and $0.\\overline{2}$\nWe have:\n$x = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$y = \\frac{2}{9}$\nThe sum is given by:\n$x + y = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9}$\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 9 in this case:\n$\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1 \\times 3}{3 \\times 3} = \\frac{3}{9}$\n$\\frac{2}{9}$ (already has the common denominator)\nThe sum is:\n$\\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n$\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$"
