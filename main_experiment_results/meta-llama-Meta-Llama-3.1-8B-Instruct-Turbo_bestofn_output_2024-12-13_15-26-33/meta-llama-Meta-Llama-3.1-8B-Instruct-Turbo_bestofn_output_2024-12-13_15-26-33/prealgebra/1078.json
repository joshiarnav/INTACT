    "To find the answer, we'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1.

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, we need to evaluate the clarity, simplicity, and adherence to the order of operations (PEMDAS) in each solution. \n\nSolution 1 is clear and concise, following the order of operations correctly.\n\nSolution 2 is also clear and concise, following the order of operations correctly.\n\nSolution 3 is somewhat repetitive, as it mentions \"Now\" before adding the results. However, it still follows the order of operations correctly.\n\nConsidering the clarity and simplicity of the solutions, I would rate Solution 1 as the best solution. It is the most concise and straightforward.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 1",
  "solution": "The order of operations says that we must do the multiplication before we do the addition.  We get \\begin{align*}3\\cdot 9&=27,\\end{align*}\\begin{align*}4\\cdot 10&=40,\\end{align*}\\begin{align*}11\\cdot 3=33,\\end{align*}and \\begin{align*}3\\cdot 8&=24.\\end{align*}Now, substituting back into the original equation and using the properties of addition we get \\begin{align*}3\\cdot 9+4\\cdot 10+11\\cdot 3+3\\cdot 8&=27+40+33+24 \\\\ &=27+33+40+24 \\\\ &=60+40+24 \\\\ &=100+24 \\\\ &=\\boxed{124}.\\end{align*}",
