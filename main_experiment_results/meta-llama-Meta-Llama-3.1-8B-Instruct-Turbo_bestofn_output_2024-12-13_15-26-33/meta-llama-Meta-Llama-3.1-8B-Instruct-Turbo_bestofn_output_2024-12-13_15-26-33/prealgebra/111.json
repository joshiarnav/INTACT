    "To find $(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5$, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: \n   - Start with the innermost parentheses: $6 + 1 - 4$\n   - Add 6 and 1: $6 + 1 = 7$\n   - Subtract 4 from 7: $7 - 4 = 3$\n\n   So the expression becomes: $(21 \\div 3) \\cdot 5$\n\n2. Evaluate the division:\n   - Divide 21 by 3: $21 \\div 3 = 7$\n\n   So the expression becomes: $7 \\cdot 5$\n\n3. Evaluate the multiplication:\n   - Multiply 7 by 5: $7 \\cdot 5 = 35$\n\nTherefore, the answer is: $\\boxed{35}$",

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 1. \n\nThe reason is that Solution 1 provides a clear and step-by-step explanation of the order of operations (PEMDAS) and how it applies to the given expression. It also breaks down the expression into smaller parts, making it easier to understand and follow along.",
  "solution": "Recall that expressions within parentheses should be done first. In the inner set of parentheses, we have $6+1-4=3.$ So, the outer set of parentheses can be rewritten as $21\\div3=7.$ Finally, \\[(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5=7\\cdot5=\\boxed{35}.\\]",
