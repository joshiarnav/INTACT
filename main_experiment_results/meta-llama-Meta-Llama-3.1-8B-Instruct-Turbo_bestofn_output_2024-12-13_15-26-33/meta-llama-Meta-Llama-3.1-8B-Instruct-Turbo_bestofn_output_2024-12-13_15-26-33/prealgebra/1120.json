    "To find the area of the shaded L-shaped region, we need to find the area of the large square minus the area of the two smaller squares inside it.\n\nThe side length of the large square is 4 units.\n\nThe area of the large square is $4^2 = 16$ square units.\n\nNow, let's find the area of the two smaller squares. \n- The first smaller square has a side length of 3 units. Its area is $3^2 = 9$ square units.\n- The second smaller square has a side length of 1 unit inside the large square but we only need the side that's also 1 unit next to the 3 unit square.  In other words we need it to be 3 units tall. So it's area is $3^2 = 9$ square units as well.\n\nHowever we only need the side that's 1 unit tall, This means the area we need is: $1 * 4 = 4$ square units.\n\nTherefore, the total area of the two smaller squares is $9 + 4 = 13$ square units.\n\nNow, to find the area of the shaded L-shaped region, we need to subtract the area of the two smaller squares from the area of the large square.\n\nThe area of the shaded L-shaped region is $16 - 13 = 3$ square units.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "To find the area of the shaded L-shaped region, we need to break it down into simpler shapes.\n\nFirst, we can see that the shaded region consists of two rectangles. One is formed by the larger square with side lengths of 4 units, and the other is formed by the smaller squares with side lengths of 1 unit and 3 units.\n\nLet's find the area of the first rectangle: \nIts length is 4 (side length of the larger square), and its width is 1 (side length of the smaller square). \nThe area of this rectangle is 4 * 1 = 4.\n\nNow, let's find the area of the second rectangle:\nIts length is 3 (side length of the smaller square), and its width is 4 (side length of the larger square). \nThe area of this rectangle is 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nHowever, this second rectangle includes an area we do not need (it is the square with a side of length 3 units). We can see the area of that square by multiplying the side length by itself: \nArea_of_square = 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nNow we need to subtract the area of the square with a side length of 3 (that we counted in the area of the second rectangle) from the sum of the two areas: \nArea = 4 (area of the first rectangle) + 12 (area of the second rectangle) - 9 (area of the square we need to remove) = 16 - 9 = 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
    "To find the area of the shaded L-shaped region, we can break it down into separate components.\n\nFirst, let's look at the large square $ABCD$. Its area can be found by multiplying the length of one side by itself. However, the length of the sides is not given, but we can see that the side lengths of the squares inside it are 1 and 3. Combining these lengths gives us two possible side lengths for the large square $ABCD$. We can easily see that the large square has a side length of 4 units because 1+1+3=4 and 3+1=4. We can also verify that if we add 1 to both 1 and 3 again and then add those 2 lengths together we get 5, and if we sum 1 and 3 we get 4. And sum 4 and 1 we also get 5 but 1+3 is 4 so the side lengths of the large square must be 4 units.\n\nNow let's break down the shaded L-shaped region into smaller components. We have a rectangle and two right triangles.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is given by $\\text{length}\\times\\text{width}$.\n\nTo calculate the area, of each of the two right triangles, we can use the formula $\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\text{base}\\times\\text{height}$.\n\nNow, let's look at the components of the shaded L-shaped region.\n\n- Rectangle area: $(3+1)\\times 1 = 4\\times 1 = 4$\n- Sum of triangle 1 area and triangle 2 area: $\\frac{1}{2}\\times 3\\times 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\times 1\\times 3 = \\frac{3}{2}\\times 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\times 1\\times 3 = \\frac{3}{2}+\\frac{3}{2}=3$\n- Total L-shaped region area: 4 - 3 = 1\n\nSo, the area of the L-shaped region is $\\boxed{1}$."
