  "problem": "Chloe wants to buy a hoodie that costs $\\$32.75$. She empties her wallet and finds she only has three $\\$10$ bills, eight quarters, and a pile of dimes. What is the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie?",

    "To find the minimum number of dimes that Chloe must have, let's first calculate how much money she already has from the three $\\$10$ bills and eight quarters, and then determine how much more money she needs to pay for the hoodie.\n\n- Chloe has three $\\$10$ bills: $3 \\times \\$10 = \\$30$\n- Chloe has eight quarters: $8 \\times \\$0.25 = \\$2$\n\nNow, let's combine the amount of money from the bills and quarters:\n$\\$30 + \\$2 = \\$32$\n\nChloe still needs to pay $\\$0.75$ to buy the hoodie.\n\nNow, let's consider the dimes: Each dime is worth $\\$0.10$. To find the minimum number of dimes she needs, we can divide the remaining amount by the value of each dime.\n\n$\\$0.75 \\div \\$0.10 = 7.5$\n\nSince Chloe cannot have a fraction of a dime, she must have at least 8 dimes to pay for the remaining $\\$0.75$.\n\nTherefore, Chloe must have at least $\\boxed{8}$ dimes in her pile to pay for the hoodie.",
    "First, let's find out how much money Chloe has in total without considering the dimes. \n\n- 3 $\\$10$ bills = $3 \\times \\$10 = \\$30$\n- 8 quarters = $8 \\times \\$0.25 = \\$2$\n\nTotal money Chloe has so far is $\\$32$.\n\nTo calculate how much more money she needs, we subtract the total money she has from the cost of the hoodie:\n\n$\\$32.75 - \\$32 = \\$0.75$\n\nSince a quarter is worth $\\$0.25$, Chloe would need:\n\n$\\$0.75 \\div \\$0.25 = 3$\n\nHowever, since she has 8 quarters, she can give the store the 8 quarters and only need $\\$0.75 - \\$0.25 \\times 8 = \\$0.75 - \\$2 = -\\$1.25$. This is incorrect, but of course, a negative amount is nonsensical, so we clearly cannot use all the existing dimes and quarters, so we must find how many dimes are required to cover the remaining value of $\\$0.75$. \n\nGiven that a dime is worth $\\$0.10$, Chloe would need:\n\n$\\$0.75 \\div \\$0.10 = 7.5$\n\nSince we can't have half of a dime, Chloe must have:\n\n$$\\boxed{8}$$dimes in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie.",
    "To find the minimum number of dimes needed, we first need to subtract the known amounts from the total cost of the hoodie.\n\nChloe has three $\\$10$ bills. So, the amount she has from these bills is $3 \\times 10 = 30.$\n\nShe also has eight quarters. Since a quarter is $\\$0.25$, the total value of these quarters is $8 \\times 0.25 = 2.$\n\nNow, let's calculate the remaining amount Chloe needs to pay for the hoodie. The hoodie costs $\\$32.75$. So, to find the remaining amount, we subtract the value of the known bills and quarters from the total cost:\n\nRemaining amount = Cost of hoodie - (Value of $\\$10$ bills + Value of quarters) \n\n= \\$32.75 - (30 + 2)\n\n= \\$32.75 - \\$32\n\n= \\$0.75\n\nSince each dime is worth $\\$0.10$, the minimum number of dimes required to cover the remaining amount of $\\$0.75$ can be found by dividing the remaining amount by the value of each dime:\n\nNumber of dimes = Remaining amount / Value of each dime\n\n= \\$0.75 / \\$0.10\n\n= 7.5\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a dime, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Chloe has enough dimes to pay for the hoodie. However, 7.5 can be represented as $\\frac{15}{2}$ whole dimes because she can give two half dimes but she wouldn't have those so we set it to 8 dimes which covers the remaining cost of the hoodie with extra having no value, leaving no need for further rounding.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of dimes Chloe needs is $\\boxed{8}$."

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 1 and Solution 2 and Solution 3 all give the same answer which is 8. However, Solution 1 is the most straightforward and easy to understand solution. \n\nSo, the index of the best solution is: 1.",
