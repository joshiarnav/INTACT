    "To find the percent of $x$ that is equal to $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$, let's solve it step by step:\n\n1. First, find $50\\%$ of $x$: \n   $50\\%$ of $x$ = $0.5x$\n\n2. Then, find $40\\%$ of $0.5x$:\n   $40\\%$ of $0.5x$ = $0.4(0.5x)$\n\n3. Multiply the numbers to simplify the expression:\n   $0.4(0.5x)$ = $0.2x$\n\nNow, we're looking for a percentage of $x$ equal to $0.2x$. To find the percentage, we'll divide by $x$ and multiply by $100$: \n\n   $\\frac{0.2x}{x}$ = $0.2$\n\n   Multiply by $100$ to convert $0.2$ to a percentage:\n   $0.2 \\times 100$ = $20\\%$\n\nSo, $\\boxed{20\\%}$ of $x$ is equal to $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$.",

    "To find the required percentage, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find 40% of 50% of x. \n\n50% of x can be calculated as 0.5x (since 50% is equivalent to 1/2 or 0.5).\n\n40% of 0.5x can be calculated as 0.4(0.5x) = 0.2x.\n\nNow, we need to find what percent of x is equal to 0.2x.\n\nLet's assume the required percentage is y%. \n\nSo, the required percentage of x is (y/100)x. \n\nThis should be equal to 0.2x (since we are looking for this value). \n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n(y/100)x = 0.2x.\n\nNow, we can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by x (since x is not equal to 0). \n\nWe get:\n\ny/100 = 0.2.\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by 100 to solve for y.\n\ny = 0.2(100)\ny = 20.\n\nSo, the required percentage is 20%.\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{20}$"
