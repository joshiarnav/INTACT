    "To find the distinct prime factors of 210, we will break it down step by step.\n\n1. Start by dividing 210 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. We get 210 \u00f7 2 = 105.\n2. Next, we divide 105 by 3, which is also a prime number. We get 105 \u00f7 3 = 35.\n3. The number 35 is not divisible by 2 or 3, so we move to the next prime number, which is 5. We get 35 \u00f7 5 = 7.\n4. Since 7 is a prime number, we cannot divide it further.\n5. So, the prime factorization of 210 is 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7.\n\nThe distinct prime factors of 210 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{4}$.",

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, I will evaluate each solution based on clarity, conciseness, and adherence to mathematical principles.\n\nSolution 1 is clear and concise, but it has a minor flaw in the explanation. It mentions that 35 is not divisible by 2 or 3, but then it divides it by 5, which is correct. However, it would be better to explain that 35 is divisible by 5, not by 2 or 3.\n\nSolution 2 is similar to Solution 1, but it has a more straightforward explanation. It directly states that 35 can be divided by 5, which is a clear and concise way to explain the step.\n\nSolution 3 is also clear and concise, but it has a minor flaw in the explanation. It mentions that 35 can be divided by 5, but then it only states that 7 is a prime number, without explaining why it cannot be divided further.\n\nBased on the evaluation, I would say that Solution 2 is the best solution, as it has the most straightforward and clear explanation. Therefore, the index number of the best solution is:\n\n$\\boxed{2}$",
  "solution": "We know that $210 = 10 \\cdot 21$. Breaking down these factors even further, we have that $10 = 2 \\cdot 5$ and $21 = 3 \\cdot 7$, so $210 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. Since these factors are all prime, $210$ has $\\boxed{4}$ distinct prime factors.",
