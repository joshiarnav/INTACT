    "To find the value of $x$, we need to find the value of $y$ first and then use the relationship between $x$ and $y$.\n\nGiven that $z$ is 60, and the value of $y$ is one-fifth the value of $z$.\n\nSo, the value of $y$ = $\\frac{1}{5}$ * $z$ = $\\frac{1}{5}$ * 60 = 12.\n\nNow, we know that the value of $x$ is one-half the value of $y$.\nSo, the value of $x$ = $\\frac{1}{2}$ * $y$ = $\\frac{1}{2}$ * 12 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{6}$.",
