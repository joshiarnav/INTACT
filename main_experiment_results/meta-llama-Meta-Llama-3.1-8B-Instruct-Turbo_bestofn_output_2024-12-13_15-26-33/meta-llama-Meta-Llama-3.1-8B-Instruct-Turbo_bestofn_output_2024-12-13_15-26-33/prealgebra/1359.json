    "To find the least positive integer divisible by each of the first eight positive integers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.\n\nFirst, we break down each number into its prime factors:\n\n1. 1 (no prime factors)\n2. 2 = 2\n3. 3 = 3\n4. 4 = 2^2\n5. 5 = 5\n6. 6 = 2 * 3\n7. 7 = 7\n8. 8 = 2^3\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime number from the factors above:\n\n- For 2, the highest power is 2^3 (from 8)\n- For 3, the power is 3 (from 3 and 6)\n- For 5, the power is 5 (from 5)\n- For 7, the power is 7 (from 7)\n\nThe LCM is the product of these highest powers:\nLCM = 2^3 * 3 * 5 * 7\n     = 8 * 3 * 5 * 7\n     = 840\n\nSo, the least positive integer divisible by each of the first eight positive integers is:\n$\\boxed{840}$",

  "critique": "All three solutions are correct and arrive at the same answer, which is 840. However, I will evaluate them based on clarity, conciseness, and adherence to mathematical principles.\n\nSolution 1 is clear and concise, but it briefly mentions \"the highest power of each prime number from the factors above\" without explicitly explaining this concept. This might cause confusion for readers unfamiliar with prime factorization.\n\nSolution 2 is more detailed and explicitly explains the concept of taking the highest power of each prime factor. It also provides a clear and step-by-step explanation.\n\nSolution 3 is concise but skips some details, such as explaining why LCM is used or the concept of taking the highest power of each prime factor.\n\nBased on these evaluations, I would say that Solution 2 is the best solution. It provides a clear and concise explanation while also being more detailed than Solution 1 and Solution 3.\n\nSo, the index number of the best solution is: 2",
