    "To find the product of $\\frac{1}{5}$ and $\\frac{3}{7}$, we multiply the two fractions together. \n\nFirst, we multiply the numerators (the numbers on top) which are 1 and 3. So, 1 * 3 = 3.\n\nNext, we multiply the denominators (the numbers on the bottom) which are 5 and 7. So, 5 * 7 = 35.\n\nTherefore, the product of $\\frac{1}{5}$ and $\\frac{3}{7}$ is $\\frac{3}{35}$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{35}}$.",

  "solution": "A product is what you get when you multiply things together. To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators together to get the new numerator. So, the numerator is $1\\times3=3$.\n\nThen, multiply the denominators together to get the new denominator. $5\\times7 = 35$. Therefore our answer is:  \\[\\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{35}}.\\]",
