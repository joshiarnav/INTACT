    "Step 1: The problem states that the average of the numbers 23 and $x$ is 27. This means that when $x$ and 23 are added together and then divided by 2, the result is 27.\n\nStep 2: Using the formula for the average, we can set up the following equation: $\\frac{23+x}{2} = 27$.\n\nStep 3: To solve for $x$, we need to isolate the variable $x$. We can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction. This gives us: $23 + x = 54$.\n\nStep 4: Next, we can subtract 23 from both sides of the equation to solve for $x$: $x = 54 - 23$.\n\nStep 5: Simplifying the equation, we get: $x = 31$.\n\nStep 6: Now that we have found the value of $x$, we can find the positive difference between 23 and $x$. This is simply the absolute value of the difference between the two numbers.\n\nStep 7: The positive difference between 23 and $x$ can be found by calculating $|23 - 31|$, which simplifies to: $| -8 | = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
    "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2. In this case, the two numbers are 23 and $x$. \n\n2. The equation for the average of 23 and $x$ is given as (23 + $x$)/2 = 27.\n\n3. Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: \n(23 + $x$)/2 = 27 \n23 + $x$ = 27 * 2 \n\n4.

Now that we have the value of $x$, let's find the positive difference between 23 and $x$. The positive difference between two numbers is their absolute difference (the difference with a positive sign).\n\n7. The absolute difference between 23 and $x$ is |23 - $x$| = |23 - 31| = | - 8 | = 8\n\nSo, the positive difference between 23 and $x$ is 8.\n\nAnd the final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
    "To find the positive difference between 23 and $x$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. The average of 23 and $x$ is given as 27. We know that the average is calculated by summing the numbers and dividing by 2. \n\n   So, we can write the equation: \n   $(23 + x)/2 = 27$\n\n2. To find $x$, we first multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n   $23 + x = 27 * 2$\n\n3. Now, we multiply 27 by 2:\n   $23 + x = 54$\n\n4. To find the value of $x$, we subtract 23 from both sides of the equation:\n   $x = 54 - 23$\n\n5. Calculate $x$:\n   $x = 31$\n\n6. Now that we have the value of $x$, we can calculate the difference between 23 and $x$:\n   Difference = $|23 - x|$\n   $|23 - 31|$\n\n7. Now, we calculate the absolute difference:\n   Difference = $|23 - 31|$\n   $| -8 |$ (The absolute value of -8 is 8)\n   \n   The difference is therefore 8.\n\nSo, the positive difference between 23 and $x$ is $\\boxed{8}$."
