    "To find the number of slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms, let's use a Venn diagram approach. \n\n1. Total slices with mushroom: 10 \n2. Total slices with pepperoni: 6 \n\nWe're trying to find the intersection of these two groups (slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms).\n\nSince every slice has at least one topping, we can use the formula for the total number of slices: \n\nTotal slices = (Total slices with pepperoni) + (Total slices with mushroom) - (Slices with both)\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for (Slices with both): \n\nSlices with both = (Total slices with pepperoni) + (Total slices with mushroom) - (Total slices)\n\nSubstituting the known values:\nNumber of slices = 12 \nTotal slices with pepperoni = 6 \nTotal slices with mushroom = 10 \n\nWe plug these values into the equation:\nSlices with both = 6 + 10 - 12 = 4 \n\nSo, there are $\\boxed{4}$ slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms.",
    "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. There are 12 slices of pizza in total.\n2. Every slice has at least one topping.\n3. Only six slices have pepperoni.\n4. Exactly ten slices have mushrooms.\n\nWe want to find out how many slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms. Let's use a Venn diagram to visualize the situation.\n\nWe can represent the slices with pepperoni as A, and the slices with mushrooms as B.\n\n- The total number of slices with pepperoni is 6 (A).\n- The total number of slices with mushrooms is 10 (B).\n- Since every slice has at least one topping, the slices that have neither pepperoni nor mushrooms are zero.\n\nFrom the above information, we can create the Venn diagram as follows:\n\n- A (pepperoni): 6\n- B (mushroom): 10\n- A \u2229 B (both): x (unknown)\n- A \u222a B (both or either): 10 (since there are only 12 slices in total)\n\nTo calculate the number of slices that have both pepperoni and mushrooms, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle states that the size of the union of two sets (A \u222a B) is equal to the sum of their sizes (A and B) minus the size of their intersection (A \u2229 B).\n\nA \u222a B = A + B - (A \u2229 B)\n\nWe know that A \u222a B = 10 (since there are only 12 slices in total, and the slices that have neither pepperoni nor mushrooms are zero). We also know A = 6, and B = 10.\n\nA \u222a B = |A| + |B| - (A \u2229 B)\n10 = 6 + 10 - (A \u2229 B)\n10 = 16 - (A \u2229 B)\n(A \u2229 B) = 6\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{6}$ slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms.",

  "solution": "There are 12 total slices, and 6 of them have pepperoni and 10 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number of the slices that have both toppings, so there are $6-n$ with just pepperoni and $10-n$ with just mushrooms.  Since every slice has at least one topping, and there are 12 slices, we must have $(6-n) + (10-n) + n = 12$, which gives $n=\\boxed{4}$.",
