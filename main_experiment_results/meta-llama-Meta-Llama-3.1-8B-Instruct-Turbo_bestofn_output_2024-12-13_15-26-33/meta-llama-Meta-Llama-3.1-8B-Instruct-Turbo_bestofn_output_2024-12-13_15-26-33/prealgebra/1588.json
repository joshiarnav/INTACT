    "To find the sum of the three different positive integers, we first need to find the prime factors of $7^3$. \n\nSince $7^3$ is already a power of a prime number (7), the only prime factor of $7^3$ is 7. \n\nNow, let's try to find three different positive integers, whose product is equal to $7^3$.\n\nWe have: \n$a \\times b \\times c = 7^3$\nSince a, b, and c are distinct positive integers, and their product is $7^3$, we can try different combinations of $7^0$, $7^1$, and $7^2$ as the exponents for a, b, and c.\n\nWe know that: \n$7^3 = 7 \\times 7^2$\nBut since a, b, and c are distinct positive integers, we cannot assign the same exponent to all the variables. \n\nLet's try a different combination.\n$7^3 = 7 \\times 7 \\times 7$\nIn the given expression, we can try:\n$a = 7^0 = 1$\n$b = 7^1 = 7$\n$c = 7^2 = 49$\nThen, we have:\n$a \\times b \\times c = 1 \\times 7 \\times 49 = 7^3$\nTherefore, the three integers are 1, 7, and 49.\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of these three integers:\n$1 + 7 + 49 = 57$\n\nSo, the sum of the three integers is 57.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57}$",
    "To find the sum of the three integers, we first need to find their values. The product of the integers is $7^3$, which is equal to $343$. \n\nNow, let's find the three different positive integers whose product is $343$. Since $343$ is a large number, we can start by finding its prime factors. \n\n$7^3$ can be expressed as $7 \\times 7 \\times 7$. This means that the three integers are $1$, $7$ and $49$ ($7 \\times 7$).\n\nNow, let's verify that their product is indeed $343$. \n$1 \\times 7 \\times 49 = 343$ ( verified)\n\nNow, we can find the sum of these integers. \nSum = $1$ + $7$ + $49$\nSum = $57$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the three integers is $\\boxed{57}$."

  "critique": "Based on the two solutions provided, I would recommend Solution 1 as the best solution. \n\nSolution 1 is more detailed and clearly explains the thought process behind finding the three integers. It also provides a clear and concise explanation for why the combination of $7^0$, $7^1$, and $7^2$ is chosen.\n\nIn contrast, Solution 2 is more concise but lacks the detailed explanation of Solution 1. It also assumes that the reader is familiar with the prime factorization of $343$, which may not be the case.\n\nTherefore, the index number of the best solution is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "solution": "All three integers must be divisors of $7^3$.  The only divisors of $7^3$ are $7^0$, $7^1$, $7^2$, $7^3$.  We have $7^3=7^0\\times7^1\\times7^2$. Thus our answer is $7^0+7^1+7^2=1+7+49=\\boxed{57}$.",
