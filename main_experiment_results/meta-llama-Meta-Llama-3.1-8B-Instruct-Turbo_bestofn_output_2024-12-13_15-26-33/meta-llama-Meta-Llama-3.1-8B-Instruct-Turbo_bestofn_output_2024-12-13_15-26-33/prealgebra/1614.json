    "Let's think step by step to find the value of $a$.\n\n1. Angela has $a$ marbles. \n2. Brian has twice as many marbles as Angela, so Brian has $2a$ marbles.\n3. Caden has three times as many marbles as Brian, so Caden has $3 \\times 2a = 6a$ marbles.\n4. Daryl has five times the number of marbles as Caden, so Daryl has $5 \\times 6a = 30a$ marbles.\n5. The total number of marbles is 78, which is the sum of the number of marbles each person has: $a + 2a + 6a + 30a = 39a$.\n6. Since $39a = 78$, we can solve for $a$ by dividing both sides of the equation by 39, giving $a = \\frac{78}{39} = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Brain has twice as many marbles as Angela: \n   Brian's marbles = 2 * Angela's marbles = 2a\n\n2. Caden has three times as many marbles as Brian: \n   Caden's marbles = 3 * Brian's marbles = 3 * (2a) = 6a\n\n3. Daryl has five times as many marbles as Caden: \n   Daryl's marbles = 5 * Caden's marbles = 5 * (6a) = 30a\n\n4. The total number of marbles Angela, Brian, Caden, and Daryl have is 78: \n   Angela's marbles + Brian's marbles + Caden's marbles + Daryl's marbles = a + 2a + 6a + 30a = 39a\n   So, 39a = 78\n\n5. Now, we need to solve for 'a' to find the value of Angela's marbles:\n   a = 78 / 39\n   a = 2\n\nSo, Angela has 2 marbles.\n\n$\\boxed{2}$",
    "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Brian has twice as many marbles as Angela, so the number of marbles Brian has is $2a$.\n\n2. Caden has three times as many marbles as Brian, so the number of marbles Caden has is $3(2a) = 6a$.\n\n3. Daryl has five times the number of marbles Caden has, so the number of marbles Daryl has is $5(6a) = 30a$.\n\n4. Since Angela, Brian, Caden and Daryl have a total of 78 marbles, we can set up an equation: \n\n$a + 2a + 6a + 30a = 78$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$39a = 78$\n\nDivide both sides by 39:\n\n$a = 2$\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{2}$."
