    "To find the average monthly balance, we need to first find the total sum of the balances over the four-month period and then divide by the number of months.\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that the balance for January (J) is 100 dollars, for February (F) is 200 dollars, for March (M) is 150 dollars, and for April (A) is 150 dollars.\n\nNow, let's find the sum: \n100 + 200 + 150 + 150 = 600\n\nSince the balances are for four months, the average balance would be the total sum divided by the number of months. \n\nAverage balance = Total sum / Number of months \n= 600 / 4 \n= 150\n\nSo, the average monthly balance in David's savings account during the four-month period shown is 150 dollars. \n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{150}$.",
