  "problem": "Given three members of a group -- Alice, Bob, and Carol -- in how many ways can these three be chosen to be the three officers (president, secretary, and treasurer) of the group, assuming no person holds more than one job?",
  "all_solutions": [
    "To find the number of ways to choose the three officers, we need to consider the positions (president, secretary, and treasurer) as distinct and individuals (Alice, Bob, and Carol) as distinct.\n\n1. **Step 1:** Choose the president. There are 3 individuals (Alice, Bob, and Carol) who can hold this position. This is because we have 3 choices for who the president will be.\n\n2. **Step 2:** After choosing the president, we have 2 individuals left to choose from for the position of secretary. Since the president's position is already filled, one of the remaining individuals can't be chosen for president. We are left with 2 choices for the secretary.\n\n3. **Step 3:** After choosing the president and the secretary, the remaining individual will be chosen for the position of treasurer. There is only 1 individual left for this position.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to choose the three officers, we multiply the number of choices at each step: 3 (for president) * 2 (for secretary) * 1 (for treasurer) = 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose the three officers is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "To determine the number of ways to choose the officers, we need to select one person for each position. \n\n1. Choosing the president: There are 3 people to choose from (Alice, Bob, or Carol). So, there are 3 options for the president position.\n\n2. Choosing the secretary: Since one person has already been chosen as the president, there are 2 people left to choose from for the secretary position. So, there are 2 options for the secretary position.\n\n3. Choosing the treasurer: After the president and secretary have been chosen, there is only 1 person left for the treasurer position.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose the officers is the product of the number of options for each position:\n3 (for the president) * 2 (for the secretary) * 1 (for the treasurer) = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 different ways to choose Alice, Bob, and Carol as the three officers of the group.\n\n$\\boxed{6}$",
    "To find the number of ways Alice, Bob, and Carol can be chosen to be the three officers, we can break down the process into steps.\n\nStep 1: Choose the President\nWe have three options to choose from (Alice, Bob, and Carol), so there are 3 ways to choose the President.\n\nStep 2: Choose the Secretary\nAfter choosing the President, we are left with two people to choose from (the chosen President can't hold both jobs). Therefore, there are 2 ways to choose the Secretary, given that one person has already been chosen as the President.\n\nStep 3: Choose the Treasurer\nAfter choosing the President and the Secretary, we are left with only one person to choose from (the remaining member of the group). Therefore, there is only 1 way to choose the Treasurer, given that the two other positions have been filled.\n\nUsing the multiplication principle, we multiply the number of choices at each step to find the total number of ways: 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 ways to choose Alice, Bob, and Carol to be the three officers of the group. \n\nSo, $\\boxed{6}$ is the answer."

  "critique": "1\n\nSolution 1 is the best solution. The other solutions (2 and 3) are similar in approach and do not provide any additional insights or clarity beyond Solution 1. Solution 1 clearly and concisely explains the steps involved in choosing the officers, making it the most effective solution.",
  "solution": "In this problem we are choosing a committee, so the order in which we choose the 3 people does not matter.  We could have chosen them in any of the following orders (where A is Alice, B is Bob, and C is Carol): ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.  So each possible committee corresponds to $3! = \\boxed{6}$ possible orderings.",
