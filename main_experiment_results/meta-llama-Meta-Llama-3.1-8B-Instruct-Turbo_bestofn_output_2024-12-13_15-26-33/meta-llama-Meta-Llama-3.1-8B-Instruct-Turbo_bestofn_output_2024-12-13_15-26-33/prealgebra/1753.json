    "To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the areas of the two squares $ABCD$ and $AEFG$.\n\nFirst, let's find the areas of the squares $ABCD$ and $AEFG$. \n\nThe area of a square is given by side^2. \n\nLet's draw a line segment from A to E, which will also be a perpendicular to BE and will help us break the problem. Because of the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that AB^2 + AE^2 = BE^2.\n\nNow, let's compute their values:\n\nBE = 9 units\nAB^2 + AE^2 = BE^2, which means AB^2 + AE^2 = 9^2\nAB^2 + AE^2 = 81\n\nWe now want to find the value of AB^2 + AE^2. Therefore, AB^2 + AE^2 = 81\n\nThe final answer is  $\\boxed{81}$.",
    "To find the sum of the areas of the two squares $ABCD$ and $AEFG$, we need to find the areas of each of them and then add them.\n\nThe area of a square is found by squaring the length of one of its sides. We're not directly given the lengths of the sides of either of these squares, but we are given a right-angled triangle $EAB$ and the length of $BE$, which is 9 units. This means that if we can express the lengths of the sides $AB$ and $AE$ in terms of $BE$, we can then find the area of each square.\n\nTo do this, we can use Pythagoras' Theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In triangle $EAB$, we know that $BE = 9$ units and that angle $EAB$ is a right angle. If we let the length of $AB$ be $x$ and the length of $AE$ be $y$, then we have:\n\n$$(x)^2 + (y)^2 = (9)^2$$\n\nWe know that the area of square $ABCD$ is $x^2$, and the area of square $AEFG$ is $y^2$. Let's find the value of $x^2 + y^2$.\n\n$$x^2 + y^2 = (9)^2 = 81$$ units squared.\n\nSo the number of square units in the sum of the areas of the two squares $ABCD$ and $AEFG$ is $\\boxed{81}$ units squared."
