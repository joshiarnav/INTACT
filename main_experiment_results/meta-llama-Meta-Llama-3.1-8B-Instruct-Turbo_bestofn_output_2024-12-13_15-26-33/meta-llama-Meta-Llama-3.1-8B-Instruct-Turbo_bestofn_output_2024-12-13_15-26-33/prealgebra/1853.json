    "To find the measure of $\\angle{AOD}$, we need step by step analysis.\n\nStep 1: Let's consider the sum of the angles formed by the vectors emanating from point O.

Then the measure of $\\angle{AOD}$ becomes 3.5$x$.\n\nStep 3: The measures of $\\angle{AOB}$ and $\\angle{COD}$ will be $90^\\circ$. Therefore, the sum of all four angles formed around the point O becomes:\n$\\angle{AOB} + \\angle{BOC} + \\angle{COD} + \\angle{AOD} =  90^\\circ + x + 90^\\circ + 3.5x = 360^\\circ$\n\nStep 4: To find the measure of $\\angle{AOD}$, we need to solve the equation formed from step 3.\n$90^\\circ + x + 90^\\circ + 3.5x = 360^\\circ$\nThis simplifies to:\n$180^\\circ + 4.5x = 360^\\circ$\n\nStep 5: Now we will isolate $x$ by subtracting $180^\\circ$ from both sides:\n$4.5x = 180^\\circ$\nThen we divide both sides by $4.5$:\n$x = 40^\\circ$\n\nStep 6: As the measure of $\\angle{BOC}$ is $x$, the measure of $\\angle{AOD}$ is $3.5x$, or $3.5 * 40^\\circ = 140^\\circ.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{140}$",

Furthermore, $\\overrightarrow{OC}$ and $\\overrightarrow{OD}$ are in the same direction as the $y$-axis, and $\\overrightarrow{OA}$ and $\\overrightarrow{OB}$ are in the same direction as the $x$-axis.
