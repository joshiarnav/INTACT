    "To find the largest possible percent error in Juan's computed area of the circle, we need to consider the maximum error in his measurement of the diameter. Given that the actual diameter is 20 cm and the measurement has an error of up to 20%, we can calculate the maximum and minimum measured diameters.\n\nThe maximum diameter measured by Juan would be $20 + 0.20 \\times 20 = 20 + 4 = 24$ cm, and the minimum would be $20 - 0.20 \\times 20 = 20 - 4 = 16$ cm.\n\nThe area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, we can express the radius as $r = \\frac{d}{2}$. \n\nFor a diameter of 20 cm, the actual area is $A_{actual} = \\pi \\times (10)^2 = 100\\pi$ square cm.\n\nNow, let's calculate the areas for the maximum and minimum measured diameters:\n- For the maximum diameter of 24 cm, the area is $A_{max} = \\pi \\times (12)^2 = 144\\pi$ square cm.\n- For the minimum diameter of 16 cm, the area is $A_{min} = \\pi \\times (8)^2 = 64\\pi$ square cm.\n\nThe percent error in the computed area is calculated as $\\frac{A_{calculated} - A_{actual}}{A_{actual}} \\times 100\\%$. \n\nTo find the largest possible percent error, we consider the percent error in the computed area when the measured diameter is at its maximum or minimum value.\n\nThe largest percent error is given by $\\frac{A_{max} - A_{actual}}{A_{actual}} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{144\\pi - 100\\pi}{100\\pi} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{44\\pi}{100\\pi} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{44}{100} \\times 100\\% = 44\\%$.\n\nSo, the largest possible percent error in Juan's computed area of the circle is $\\boxed{44}$.",
    "To find the largest possible percent error in Juan's computed area, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the true area of the circle**: The formula for the area of a circle is \\(A = \\pi r^2\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius. Given that the diameter is 20 cm, the radius is half of that, which is 10 cm. So, the true area of the circle is \\(A = \\pi (10\\,cm)^2 = 100\\pi\\,cm^2\\).\n\n2. **Determine the possible measurement errors**: The actual diameter is 20 cm, but Juan's measurement has an error of up to 20%. This means his measurement could be anywhere between 80% and 120% of the actual diameter. 80% of 20 cm is \\(0.8 \\cdot 20\\,cm = 16\\,cm\\) and 120% of 20 cm is \\(1.2 \\cdot 20\\,cm = 24\\,cm\\).\n\n3. **Compute the areas based on Juan's measurements**: For a diameter of 16 cm, the radius is 8 cm. The area is \\(A = \\pi (8\\,cm)^2 = 64\\pi\\,cm^2\\). For a diameter of 24 cm, the radius is 12 cm. The area is \\(A = \\pi (12\\,cm)^2 = 144\\pi\\,cm^2\\).\n\n4. **Compute the percent error**: The percent error is the absolute difference between the measured area and the true area, divided by the true area, multiplied by 100. The largest possible percent error is when the diameter is measured as 24 cm. So, the percent error is \\( \\left| \\frac{144\\pi - 100\\pi}{100\\pi} \\right| \\cdot 100 = \\left| \\frac{44\\pi}{100\\pi} \\right| \\cdot 100 = \\boxed{44} \\)."

  "solution": "Juan can measure the diameter as a length anywhere between $20 - 20\\cdot 0.2 = 16$ and $20 + 20\\cdot 0.2 = 24$  cm. The actual area of the circle is $\\pi (20/2)^2=100\\pi$ square cm, but Juan can compute the area anywhere in the range $\\pi (16/2)^2=64 \\pi$ square cm to $\\pi (24/2)^2=144 \\pi$ square cm. Using the lower bound of the range, Juan's error is $(100\\pi - 64\\pi)/(100\\pi)=36\\%$. Using the upper bound of the range, Juan's error is $(144\\pi - 100\\pi)/(100\\pi)=44\\%$.
