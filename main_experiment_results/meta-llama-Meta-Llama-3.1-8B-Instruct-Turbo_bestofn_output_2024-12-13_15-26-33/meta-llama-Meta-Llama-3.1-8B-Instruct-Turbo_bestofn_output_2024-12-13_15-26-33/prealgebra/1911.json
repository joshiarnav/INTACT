    "We are given a hexagonal lattice with 7 points. There are three types of equilateral triangles we can make in this lattice: those with side length one, those with side length $\\sqrt{3}$, and those with side length $\\sqrt{7}$.\n\n- For the triangles with side length one, we can start at any of the 7 points and draw an equilateral triangle. However, we have to remember that if a point is shared by multiple triangles, it is counted only once in our total. Therefore, we count each triangle once. The points in the lattice offering such an arrangement is limited to $\\text{(}6\\times1\\text{)}=6$  equilateral triangles. Here, a large chunk of overcounting is avoided, and the right value is achieved by this counting strategy.\n\n- For the triangles with side length $\\sqrt{3}$, we know there are two sets of two equilateral triangles and that the triangles must share the center point.\n\n- For the triangles with side length $\\sqrt{7}$, the only arrangement would be for the four corner points. This gives only one equilateral triangle with side length $\\sqrt{7}$.\n\nBy summing the three types of triangles, we get a total count of $6 + 2 + 1 = \\boxed{9}$.",
    "To find the number of equilateral triangles with all three vertices in the lattice, we need to consider the different possible configurations of the triangles.\n\nStep 1:  The first step is to understand the properties of equilateral triangles. An equilateral triangle has all sides of equal length and all angles are $60^\\circ$. \nStep 2:  Based on the given lattice, we can see that the distance between any two adjacent points is $1$. Therefore, the maximum side length for an equilateral triangle within the lattice is $2$. This implies that the vertices of an equilateral triangle cannot be more than $2$ units apart from each other.\nStep 3:  With this understanding, we can start looking at different configurations of equilateral triangles within the lattice. The first case is when the equilateral triangle is formed by $3$ consecutive points. We can observe that there are two such equilateral triangles in the given lattice.\nStep 4:  The second case is when the equilateral triangle is formed by points that are $3$ units apart from each other. By visualizing the lattice, we can find two such equilateral triangles. Both of these triangles are oriented at a $60^\\circ$ angle.\nStep 5:  Finally, there is an equilateral triangle with side length $2$, formed by four points. There are two such triangles in the given lattice, with one oriented at a $60^\\circ$ angle and the other at a $300^\\circ$ angle to the lowest vertex.\nStep 6:  By identifying the different configurations of equilateral triangles within the lattice and counting them, we can find the total number of such triangles.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- $2$ equilateral triangles formed by $3$ consecutive points.\n- $2$ equilateral triangles formed by points $3$ units apart from each other, both oriented at a $60^\\circ$ angle.\n- $2$ equilateral triangles formed by points with side length $2$, one oriented at a $60^\\circ$ angle and the other at a $300^\\circ$ angle to the lowest vertex.\n\nTherefore, the total number of equilateral triangles with all three vertices in the lattice is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "To find the equilateral triangles, we can consider each point as the potential center of a triangle. \n\nGiven points (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) for the hexagonal lattice labeled accordingly from (0, 0), to ( 0, $2\\pi$ ) and points labeled (A) to (H): \n\n1. A to B and back again with a 60-degree angle to get point C; however, to get the third point E ( used in one possible equilateral triangle - points A, C, E).\n2. Using point A (center), draw to points D, F; however, we get only one triangle when we do so: Points A, D, F.\n3. Next consider points B and C and point G. However we find that we have formed A point, B and C, G with three sides in three different ways using this method. \nIf we do the same using points D and F and G it is clear that we have thirteen different equilateral triangles, then do the same from point G. Then we will have a total of 13 different equilateral triangles from this method, since we'll see each points point twice. \n\n1. Since we used all points to create the triangle; thus there were no redundant triangles created by this method.\n\nWe've established that total number of equilateral triangles is 13 since we have everywhere accounted and no redundant triangles were created. Hence, the correct number of equilateral triangles is $\\boxed{13}.$"
