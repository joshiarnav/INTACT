    "To find the value of x, we need to first find the arithmetic mean of the given expressions. \n\nThe arithmetic mean of a set of numbers is their sum divided by the total count of numbers. In this case, we have five expressions, so we will add them up and divide by 5 (which is the count of expressions).\n\nFirst, let's add up the expressions:\n\n$(x + 8) + 15 + 2x + 13 + (2x + 4)$\n\nTo add these expressions, we need to combine like terms. \n\n$(x + 8) + 15 + 2x + 13 + (2x + 4)$\n$= x + 8 + 15 + 2x + 13 + 2x + 4$  ( distributing parentheses)\n$= x + 2x + 2x + 8 + 15 + 13 + 4$  (combining like terms)\n$= 5x + 40$\n\nWe then divide the sum by 5 (the total count of expressions):\n\n$(5x + 40) / 5$\n$= x + 8$\n\nWe're given that the mean of these expressions is 24; therefore, we set the expression for the mean equal to 24 and solve for x.\n\n$x + 8 = 24$\n\nWe isolate x by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:\n\n$x + 8 - 8 = 24 - 8$\n$x = 16$\n\nTherefore, the value of x is $\\boxed{16}$.",

    "To find the value of x, we first need to find the arithmetic mean of the given expressions, which is 24. \n\nThe arithmetic mean is calculated by summing up all the given values and then dividing by the number of values. \n\nHere are the steps to find the sum of these expressions:\n\n1.

  "solution": "Since the arithmetic mean of these expressions is 24, we can write the expression for the mean: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{(x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)}{5}&=24\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad (x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)&=5\\cdot 24\n\\end{align*}\n\nCombining like terms on the left, we find $5x+40=120$, so $5x=80$, from which we have $x=16$.
