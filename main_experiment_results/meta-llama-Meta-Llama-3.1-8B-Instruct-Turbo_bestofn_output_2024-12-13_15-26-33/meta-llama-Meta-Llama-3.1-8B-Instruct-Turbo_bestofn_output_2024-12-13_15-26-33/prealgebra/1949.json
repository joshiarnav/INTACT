    "To find the smallest positive number that is prime and $10$ less than a perfect square, we need to check each perfect square, subtract $10$ from it, and then verify if the resulting number is prime.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Start by checking perfect squares: The smallest perfect squares are $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, \\ldots$.\n\n2. Subtract $10$ from each perfect square and check for primality:\n- $1 - 10 = -9$ (not a positive number)\n- $4 - 10 = -6$ (not a positive number)\n- $9 - 10 = -1$ (not a positive number)\n- $16 - 10 = 6$ (not a prime number, as it is divisible by $2$ and $3$)\n- $25 - 10 = 15$ (not a prime number, as it is divisible by $3$ and $5$)\n- $36 - 10 = 26$ (not a prime number, as it is divisible by $2$)\n- $49 - 10 = 39$ (not a prime number, as it is divisible by $3$ and $13$)\n- $64 - 10 = 54$ (not a prime number, as it is divisible by $2$ and $3$ and $9$)\n- $81 - 10 = 71$ (is a prime number, as it is only divisible by $1$ and $71$)\n\n3. We have found the first perfect square that results in a prime number when $10$ is subtracted from it.\n\nSo, the smallest positive number that is prime and $10$ less than a perfect square is $71$.\n\n$\\boxed{71}$",
    "To find the smallest positive number that is prime and $10$ less than a perfect square, we can start by listing the perfect squares and then subtracting $10$ from each. \n\nFirst, we need to find the smallest perfect square that is larger than $10$. We can start with the square of integers greater than $3$: \n$4^2 = 16 > 10$ (but we should check if it is prime when we subtract 10)\n\nThen the next perfect squares are $5^2 = 25$,\n$6^2 = 36$,\n$7^2 = 49$,\n$8^2 = 64$,\n\nSubtracting $10$ from each perfect square:\n$16 - 10 = 6$.\n$25 - 10 = 15$.\n$36 - 10 = 26$.\n$49 - 10 = 39$.\n$64 - 10 = 54$.\n\nNow, we can check each resulting number to see if it is prime:\n$6$ is not prime (it has factors $2$ and $3$).\n$15$ is not prime (it has factors $3$ and $5$).\n$26$ is not prime (it has factors $2$ and $13$).\n$39$ is not prime (it has factors $3$ and $13$).\n$54$ is not prime (it has factors $2$, $3$, and $9$).\n\nSince none of the first few results from subtracting $10$ from a perfect square are prime, we need to continue checking with other perfect squares.\n$9^2 = 81 > 70$,\n$81 - 10 = 71$.\n\n$71$ is a prime number.

    "To find the smallest positive number that is prime and $10$ less than a perfect square, let's consider the following steps:\n\n1. Let $n$ be the perfect square. We are looking for a number of the form $n - 10$.\n\n2. For the number $n-10$ to be prime, it cannot be divisible by any integers except $1$ and itself. Therefore, $n - 10$ must be a prime number.\n\n3. Since $n$ is a perfect square, it is always positive and non-zero. Thus, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $1$, but since $1-10 = -9$, which is not a prime number, we need to consider the next perfect square.\n\n4. The smallest perfect square greater than $1$ is $4$. If $n=4$, then $n-10=-6$, which is not a positive number. So, let's increase $n$ by $1$ and consider $n=9$.\n\n5. For $n = 9$, we get $n-10=-1$, which is not a positive number either. Let's increase $n$ by $1$ again and consider $n=16$.\n\n6. For $n = 16$, we get $n-10=6$, which is not a prime number since it is divisible by $2$ and $3$. So let's consider the next perfect square $25$.\n\n7. For $n = 25$, we get $n-10=15$, which is not a prime number since it is divisible by $3$ and $5$. Let's consider the next perfect square $36$.\n\n8. For $n = 36$, we get $n-10=26$, which is not a prime number since it is divisible by $2$ and $13$. Let's consider the next perfect square $49$.\n\n9. For $n = 49$, we get $n-10=39$, which is not a prime number as it is a multiple of both $3$ and $13$. Let's consider the next perfect square which is $4^3=64$.\n\n10. For $n = 64$, we get $n-10 = 54$, which is not a prime as it has multiple divisors other than one and itself.\n\n11. For $n=81$ (next perfect square), we get $81 - 10 = 71$.\n\nNow, $71$ is indeed a prime number, which is the first instance of a number of the form $n-10$ being prime after checking a sufficient number of perfect squares.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive number that is prime and $10$ less than a perfect square is $\\boxed{71}$."
