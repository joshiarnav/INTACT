    "To find the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on, we'll break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Only one quarter of the earth's surface is not covered by bodies of water. This means 1/4 of the earth's surface is exposed land.\n2. Since only one half of that exposed land area is inhabitable for humans, we need to multiply 1/4 by 1/2.\n   To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators separately:\n   (1/4) * (1/2) = (1 * 1) / (4 * 2)\n   = 1/8\n\nSo, humans can live on $\\boxed{1/8}$ of the earth's surface.",

Only one half of that exposed land area, $\\frac{1}{2}$, is inhabitable for humans due to reasons like the poles and deserts.\n\nSo, to find the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on, we multiply the fraction of exposed land area by the fraction of that area that is inhabitable:\n\n$\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$.",
    "To find the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. One quarter of the earth's surface is not covered by bodies of water, which can be represented as 1/4.\n\n2. This represents 25% or 0.25 of the earth's surface that is not covered by water.\n\n3. Only one half of this exposed land area is inhabitable for humans. This means 50% or 0.5 of the 0.25 (exposed land area) is inhabitable for humans.\n\n4. To find the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on, multiply 0.25 (exposed land) by 0.5 (inhabitable land).\n\n0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125\n\nAs a fraction, 0.125 can be represented as 1/8.\n\nSo, the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on is $\\boxed{1/8}$."
