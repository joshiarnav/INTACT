    "To find the value of $y$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. We are given that $x = -5$.\n2. Substitute the value of $x$ into the equation $x^2 = y - 3$:\n   $(-5)^2 = y - 3$\n3. Expand the left side of the equation:\n   $25 = y - 3$\n4. To isolate $y$, add 3 to both sides of the equation:\n   $25 + 3 = y - 3 + 3$\n   This simplifies to:\n   $28 = y$\n5. Therefore, the value of $y$ is $\\boxed{28}$.\n\nIt's always a good idea to double-check your work, but in this case, the steps seem to be correct.",
