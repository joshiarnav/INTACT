  "problem": "A toy store manager received a large order of Mr. Slinkums just in time for the holidays. The manager places $20\\%$ of them on the shelves, leaving the other 120 Mr. Slinkums in storage. How many Mr. Slinkums were in this order?",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The manager places 20% of the Mr. Slinkums on the shelves. This means that 80% of the Mr. Slinkums are left in storage.\n\n2. We know that 80% of the Mr. Slinkums equal 120. So we can set up the equation:\n\n   0.8x = 120   , where x is the total number of Mr. Slinkums.\n\n3. To find the value of x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.8:\n\n   x = 120 / 0.8\n\n   x = 150\n\nTherefore, the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order was 150.\n\n$\\boxed{150}$",
    "Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The manager placed $20\\%$ of the Mr. Slinkums on the shelves. This means that the Mr. Slinkums on the shelves are $20\\%$ of the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order.\n2. If the number of Mr. Slinkums on the shelves is $20\\%$ of the total, then the number of Mr. Slinkums left in storage is $80\\%$ of the total (since $100\\% - 20\\% = 80\\%$).\n3. We are given that there are 120 Mr. Slinkums in storage, which is $80\\%$ of the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order.\n4. We can set up the equation: \n   \\[ 80\\% \\text{ of the total} = 120 \\]\n   \\[ 0.80 \\times \\text{ the total} = 120 \\]\n   \\[ \\text{ the total} = 120 / 0.80 \\]\n   \\[ \\text{ the total} = 150 \\]\n\nSo, the order was for $\\boxed{150}$ Mr. Slinkums.",
    "Let's denote the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order as $x$.\n\nSince $20\\%$ of the Mr. Slinkums were placed on the shelves, this is equal to $0.20 \\cdot x$.\n\nThe remaining Mr. Slinkums were put into storage, and we know there are 120 Mr. Slinkums in storage. This means that the number of Mr. Slinkums in storage is equal to $x - 0.20 \\cdot x = 0.80 \\cdot x$.\n\nSince the number of Mr. Slinkums in storage is 120, we can set up the equation $0.80 \\cdot x = 120$.\n\nTo solve this equation for $x$, we divide both sides by $0.80$:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{120}{0.80} = 150\n\\]\n\nSo the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order is $\\boxed{150}$."

  "solution": "If $20\\%$ of the toys were put on the shelves, the $80\\%$ of the toys were left in storage.  Therefore, we are given $80\\% T=120$, where $T$ is the number of toys in the order.  Rewriting $80\\%$ as $\\frac{4}{5}$ and multiplying both sides by $\\frac{5}{4}$, we find that $T=120\\cdot\\frac{5}{4}=30\\cdot 5=\\boxed{150}$.",
