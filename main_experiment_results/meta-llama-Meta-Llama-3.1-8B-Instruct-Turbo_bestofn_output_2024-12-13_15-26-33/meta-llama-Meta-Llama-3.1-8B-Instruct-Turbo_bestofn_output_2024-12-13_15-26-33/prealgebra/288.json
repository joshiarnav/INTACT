    "To solve this problem, let's first identify the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime.\n\nOne-digit primes are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves, and the one-digit numbers that meet this condition are 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\nThe two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7.\n\nNext, we need to find the largest two-digit prime. Two-digit numbers range from 10 to 99. We will look for the largest prime number within this range.\n\nTo do this, let's start by eliminating composite numbers (numbers that have more than two factors). We can start with multiples of the smallest prime numbers and eliminate them: multiples of 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nLet's eliminate the multiples of 2, 3, 5, and 7 in the two-digit range to find the largest prime number.\n\nStarting with the lower end:\n- Multiples of 2 (all even numbers)\n- Multiples of 3: 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96\n- Multiples of 5: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95\n- Multiples of 7: 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91\n\nThe leftover numbers that haven't been eliminated are candidates for being prime numbers.\n\nLooking at the leftover numbers:\n- 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97\n\nWe're looking for the largest number that's prime in the two-digit range, so we'll look for the largest one:\n\nThe largest two-digit prime is 97.\n\nNow, let's multiply the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime together:\n\n5 * 7 = 35\n35 * 97 = 3395\n\nSo, the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime is $\\boxed{3395}$.",
    "To find the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime:\n\n1. Finding the largest one-digit primes: One-digit primes are 2, 3, 5, 7. Among these, the two largest are 5 and 7.\n\n2. Finding the largest two-digit prime: Two-digit primes range from 11 to 97. The largest two-digit prime is 97.\n\nNow, we multiply the two largest one-digit primes (5 and 7) and the largest two-digit prime (97):\n\n5 * 7 = 35\n35 * 97 = 3395\n\nSo, the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime is $\\boxed{3395}$."
