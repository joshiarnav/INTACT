    "To solve the expression $6 \\div 3 - 2 - 8 + 2 \\cdot 8$, let's follow the order of operations (PEMDLAS):\n\n1. Divide 6 by 3: $6 \\div 3 = 2$\n2. Multiply 2 by 8: $2 \\cdot 8 = 16$\n3. Now, substitute the values back into the expression: $2 - 2 - 8 + 16$\n4. Subtract 2 and then 8: $2 - 2 = 0$, $0 - 8 = -8$\n5. Finally, add 16 to -8: $-8 + 16 = 8$\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{8}$.",

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 2. \n\nThe reason is that Solution 2 accurately follows the order of operations (PEMDAS) and breaks down the problem step by step, making it easy to understand and follow. \n\nSolution 1 and Solution 3 are similar, but Solution 2 is more concise and follows the order of operations more accurately. \n\nTherefore, the index of the best solution is 2.",
  "solution": "Recall that multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction. We get \\[\n6 \\div 3 - 2 - 8 + 2 \\cdot 8 = 2 - 2 - 8 + 16.\n\\]We rewrite the subtractions as additions of negations so we can rearrange:  \\begin{align*}\n2 - 2 - 8 + 16 &= 2 + (-2) + (-8) + 16 \\\\\n&= 16 + 2 + (-2) + (-8) \\\\\n&= 18 - (2+8) \\\\\n&= 18-10 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{8}.\n\\end{align*}",
