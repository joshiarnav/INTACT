    "To find the sum of the decimal equivalents of $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, we need to first convert these fractions into their decimal forms.\n\nFor $\\frac{1}{7}$, the decimal form is 0.142857142857... (this is a repeating decimal).\n\nFor $\\frac{1}{3}$, the decimal form is 0.3333333333... (this is also a repeating decimal).\n\nThe repeating pattern in $\\frac{1}{7}$ is 142857 and it repeats every 6 digits.\n\nThe repeating pattern in $\\frac{1}{3}$ is 3 and it repeats indefinitely.\n\nHowever, we can consider the repeating pattern in the sum as the sum of the repeating patterns in $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. To find the repeating pattern in the sum, we add the repeating patterns: 142857 + 333333 = 475890.\n\nThe repeating pattern in the sum is 475890 and it repeats every 6 digits (as the length of the repeating pattern in $\\frac{1}{7}$ is 6).\n\nNow we need to find the 20th digit after the decimal point of the sum. \n\nAs the repeating pattern has a length of 6, we can find the position of the 20th digit in the repeating pattern by taking the remainder when 20 is divided by 6 (this will tell us where in the repeating pattern the 20th digit is located).\n\n20 % 6 = 2, which means the 20th digit is the 2nd digit in the repeating pattern.\n\nThe 2nd digit in the repeating pattern is 7.\n\nTherefore, the 20th digit after the decimal point of the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",

  "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$, and that of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $0.\\overline{3}$. The first has a repeating block of 6 digits and the second has a repeating block of 1 digit, so we believe the repeating block of the sum will have 6 digits and try adding the first 6 digits of each decimal representation.  $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}& & &. &1 & 4 & \\stackrel{1}{2} & 8 & \\stackrel{1}{5} & 7\\\\& +& &. &3 &3 & 3 & 3& 3 & 3\\\\ \\cline{1-9} & & & .& 4 &7 & 6 & 1 & 9 & 0\\\\ \\end{array} $$ Notice that continuing the addition past the first six digits will result in repeating blocks of the same six digits ($.142857+.333333=.476190$), so the decimal representation of the sum is $0.\\overline{476190}$. Since 20 divided by 6 has a remainder of 2, the 20th digit following the decimal point is the same as the second digit following the decimal point, which is $\\boxed{7}$.",
