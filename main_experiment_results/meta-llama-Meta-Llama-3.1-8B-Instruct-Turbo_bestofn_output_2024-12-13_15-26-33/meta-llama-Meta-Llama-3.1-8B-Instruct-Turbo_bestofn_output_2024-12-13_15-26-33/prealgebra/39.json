    "To solve this problem, we'll start with the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 180(3) = 540$ degrees.\n\nGiven that $\\angle M \\cong \\angle T \\cong \\angle H$, we can let the measure of each of these angles be $x$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$\\angle M = \\angle T = \\angle H = x$\n\nSince $\\angle A$ and $\\angle S$ are supplementary (meaning they add up to $180^\\circ$), we can let $\\angle A = 180 - \\angle S$. We'll use $\\angle S$ as a variable as well, so we have:\n\n$\\angle A = 180 - \\angle S$\n\nNow we can write the equation for the sum of the angles in pentagon $MATHS$:\n\n$x + x + x + (180 - \\angle S) + \\angle S = 540$\n\nCombine like terms and simplify:\n\n$3x + 180 = 540$\n\nNow we solve for $x$. Subtract 180 from both sides:\n\n$3x = 360$\n\nDivide both sides by 3 to find the value of $x$:\n\n$x = 120$\n\nTherefore, the measure of $\\angle H$ is $x = \\boxed{120}$ degrees.",
    "To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the sum of interior angles in a pentagon is 540 degrees. \n\nStep 1: Since $\\angle M \\cong \\angle T \\cong \\angle H$, let's call all these angles x. We have 3 angles equal to x.\n\nStep 2: $\\angle A$ is supplementary to $\\angle S$. This means that the sum of $\\angle A$ and $\\angle S$ is 180 degrees. Let's call $\\angle A$ y and $\\angle S$ 180-y (since they are supplementary).\n\nStep 3: The sum of all interior angles in a pentagon is 540 degrees. We can write the equation as follows: \nx + x + x + y + (180 - y) = 540\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the equation, we get: \n3x + 180 = 540\n\nStep 5: Subtract 180 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x. \n3x = 360\n\nStep 6: Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x. \nx = 120\n\nTherefore, the measure of $\\angle H$ is 120 degrees.\n\n$\\boxed{120}$",
    "The sum of the interior angles in a pentagon is given by the formula (n-2)*180, where n is the number of sides. Since a pentagon has 5 sides, the sum of the interior angles is (5-2)*180 = 3*180 = 540 degrees.\n\nWe know that $\\angle M \\cong \\angle T \\cong \\angle H$, so let's call the measure of these angles \"x\". Now, we know that $\\angle A$ is supplementary to $\\angle S$, meaning their sum is 180 degrees. \n\nIn addition, we have $\\angle A + \\angle M + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle S = 540$. \n\nReplacing $\\angle A + \\angle S$ with 180, we can rewrite this as:\n180 + $\\angle M + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle S = 540$.\nSubtracting 180 from both sides, we have\n$\\angle M + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle S = 360$.\n\nWe know that $\\angle M \\cong \\angle T \\cong \\angle H$, so we can write\n3x + $\\angle S = 360$.\n\nNow, we also know that $\\angle A + \\angle S = 180$, but we don't know the value of $\\angle A$. However, we do know that $\\angle M + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle A + \\angle S = 540$. Replacing $\\angle A + \\angle S$ with 180, we have\n$\\angle M + \\angle T + \\angle H + 180 = 540$.\n\nSubtracting 180 from both sides, we have \n$\\angle M + \\angle T + \\angle H = 360$.\n\nWe know that $\\angle M \\cong \\angle T \\cong \\angle H$, so we can write\n3x = 360.\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we have\nx = 360 / 3 = 120.\n\nSo, $\\angle H$ is 120 degrees.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{120}$."

  "solution": "The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so we must have \\[\\angle M + \\angle A + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle S = 540^\\circ.\\] Since $\\angle A$ and $\\angle S$ are supplementary, we have $\\angle A +\\angle S = 180^\\circ$.  Combining this with $\\angle H = \\angle M = \\angle T$, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\angle M + \\angle A + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle S& =\n(\\angle M + \\angle T + \\angle H) \\\\\n&\\qquad+ (\\angle A +\\angle S) \\\\\n&= 3\\angle H + 180^\\circ,\\end{align*} so $3\\angle H + 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ$.
