    "To determine the distance Piravena travels for her complete trip, we need to find the individual distances for each leg of the trip and then add them together.\n\nFirst, we are given distances from A to C, which is 3000 km, and from A to B, which is 3250 km. We also have the right-angled triangle represented, and we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance from B to C.\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem states that for a right-angled triangle with legs of length a and b, and a hypotenuse of length c, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.\n\nIn this case, we have the legs of length 3000 and an unknown b. The hypotenuse is 3250.\n\nWe can apply the theorem by rearranging the formula to isolate the unknown b:\n\n$b^2 = c^2 - a^2$\n\n$b^2 = 3250^2 - 3000^2$\n\n$b^2 = 10562500 - 9000000$\n\n$b^2 = 1562500$\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find b:\n\n$b = \\sqrt{1562500}$\n\n$b = 1250$\n\nNow that we have the distances for each leg of the trip (AB, BC, CA), we can add them together to find the total distance Piravena travels.\n\nTotal distance = AB + BC + CA\nTotal distance = 3250 + 1250 + 3000\nTotal distance = 7500\n\nSo, Piravena travels 7500 km for her complete trip.\n\n$\\boxed{7500}$",

    "To find the distance Piravena travels, we need to calculate the total distance traveled for the complete trip from $A$ to $B$, then from $B$ to $C$, and finally from $C$ back to $A$. \n\n1. Distance from $A$ to $B$: \n   Given in the problem, the distance from $A$ to $B$ is $3250$ km.\n\n2. Distance from $B$ to $C$: \n   Since $A, B, C$ form a right-angled triangle with right angle at point $C,$ we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance from $B$ to $C$. The Pythagorean Theorem states that for any right triangle with legs of lengths $a$ and $b$ and a hypotenuse of length $c,$ \n   \\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2.\\] \n   Here, we have that the length of the hypotenuse ($c$) is $3250$ km and one of the legs ($a$) is $3000$ km. So, let's solve for the other leg ($b$), which is the distance from $B$ to $C$.\n   \\begin{align*}\n    a^2 + b^2 &= c^2\\\\\n    3000^2 + b^2 &= 3250^2\\\\\n    9000000 + b^2 &= 10562500\\\\\n    b^2 &= 10562500 - 9000000\\\\\n    b^2 &= 1562500\\\\\n    b &= \\sqrt{1562500}\\\\\n    b &= 1250\n    \\end{align*}\n   So, the distance from $B$ to $C$ is $1250$ km.\n\n3.
