    "To find the probability of a blue face facing up when the cube is rolled, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Count the total number of possible outcomes**: Since the cube has 6 faces, there are 6 possible outcomes when it is rolled.\n\n2. **Count the number of favorable outcomes**: We want to find the number of outcomes where a blue face is facing up. Since there are 4 blue faces, there are 4 favorable outcomes.\n\n3. **Calculate the total probability**: The probability of a blue face facing up is the number of favorable outcomes (4) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (6).\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\n4/6 = 2/3\n\nSince we are asked to provide the answer in the format of a box, the probability can be represented as:\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$",
    "To find the probability of a blue face facing up when the cube is rolled, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to determine the total number of faces on the cube. Since it's a cube, it has 6 faces in total.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the number of faces that are blue. We are given that there are 4 blue faces on the cube.\n\n3. To find the probability of a blue face facing up, we will divide the number of blue faces by the total number of faces on the cube.\n\nSo, the number of blue faces (B) is 4, and the total number of faces (T) is 6.\n\nProbability of a blue face facing up = B / T\n= 4 / 6\n= 2 / 3\n\nTherefore, the probability of a blue face facing up when the cube is rolled is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
    "To find the probability of a blue face facing up when the cube is rolled, we need to consider the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes (i.e., blue faces).\n\nSince the cube has 6 faces, there are 6 possible outcomes when it is rolled. \n\nOut of these 6 faces, 4 are blue. So, the number of favorable outcomes (blue faces) is 4.\n\nTo find the probability of a blue face facing up, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\n= 4 / 6\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:\n\n= (4 \u00f7 2) / (6 \u00f7 2)\n= 2 / 3\n\nSo, the probability of a blue face facing up when the cube is rolled is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$."

  "critique": "The best solution is Solution 1.",
  "solution": "We have 6 equally likely outcomes, corresponding to the 6 faces of the cube.  4 of those 6 outcomes are successful ones (meaning a blue face is facing up).  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
