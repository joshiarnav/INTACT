    "To find the sum of the prime factors of 91, we first need to find the prime factors themselves. \n\nStep 1: Check if 91 is divisible by the smallest prime numbers (2, 3, 5). We find that 91 is not divisible by these numbers.\n\nStep 2: The next prime number is 7. We can check if 7 divides 91:\n\n91 \u00f7 7 = 13\n\nSo, we have found two prime factors: 7 and 13.\n\nStep 3: Now, we need to find the sum of these prime factors:\n\nSum = 7 + 13 = 20\n\nTherefore, the sum of the prime factors of 91 is:\n\n$\\boxed{20}$",

    "To find the sum of the prime factors of 91, let's first find the prime factors themselves. \n\nWe can start by dividing 91 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. However, since 91 is not divisible by 2, we move on to the next prime number, which is 3. \n\n91 \u00f7 3 = 30.333..., which is not a whole number. So, we move on to the next prime number, which is 5. \n\n91 \u00f7 5 = 18.2, which is also not a whole number. So, we continue with the next prime number, which is 7.\n\n91 \u00f7 7 = 13. This is a whole number, so we have found one of the prime factors of 91, which is 7. \n\nNow, we need to find the other prime factor. To do this, we divide 13 (since 91 = 7 * 13) by the smallest prime number, which is 2, or we check if 13 is prime by dividing it by the next possible prime numbers which are 3, 5, etc. It turns out 13 is prime.\n\nSo, the prime factors of 91 are 7 and 13. \n\nThe sum of these prime factors is 7 + 13 = 20. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the prime factors of 91 is $\\boxed{20}$."

  "critique": "To determine the best solution, we need to evaluate the clarity, conciseness, and effectiveness of each solution.\n\nSolution 1 is clear and concise, and it directly finds the prime factors of 91.\n\nSolution 2 is also clear and concise, and it follows a similar approach to Solution 1.\n\nSolution 3 is a bit more verbose, and it tries to find the prime factors by dividing 91 by the smallest prime numbers, but it doesn't follow a straightforward approach.\n\nBased on the effectiveness and conciseness of the solutions, I would say that Solution 1 is the best solution. However, since you asked for the index number (1 to 3) of the best solution, I would return:\n\n1\n\nThis is the index number of Solution 1, which is the best solution.",
  "solution": "Since 91 is not divisible by the first three prime numbers, we try dividing $91\\div 7$.  We find a quotient of 13, so $91=7\\times 13$ and the sum of these prime factors is $7+13=\\boxed{20}$.",
