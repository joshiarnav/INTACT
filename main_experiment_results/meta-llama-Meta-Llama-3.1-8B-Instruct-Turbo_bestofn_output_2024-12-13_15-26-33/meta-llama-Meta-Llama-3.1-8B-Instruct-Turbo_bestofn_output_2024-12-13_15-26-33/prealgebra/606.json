    "First, let's find the side length of each triangle in the sequence.\n- First equilateral triangle has sides of length 2 units.\n- Second equilateral triangle has sides of length $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the first triangle, so each side is $150\\% \\times 2 = 1.5 \\times 2 = 3$ units.\n- Third equilateral triangle has sides of length $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the second triangle, so each side is $150\\% \\times 3 = 1.5 \\times 3 = 4.5$ units.\n- Fourth equilateral triangle has sides of length $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the third triangle, so each side is $150\\% \\times 4.5 = 1.5 \\times 4.5 = 6.75$ units.\n\nNow, let's find the perimeter of each triangle.\n- First equilateral triangle has a perimeter of $3 \\times 2 = 6$ units.\n- Second equilateral triangle has a perimeter of $3 \\times 3 = 9$ units.\n- Third equilateral triangle has a perimeter of $3 \\times 4.5 = 13.5$ units.\n- Fourth equilateral triangle has a perimeter of $3 \\times 6.75 = 20.25$ units.\n\nNow, we can calculate the percent increase in the perimeter from the first triangle to the fourth triangle.\nPercent increase in the perimeter is calculated as: $\\frac{(Final\\ perimeter - Initial\\ perimeter)}{Initial\\ perimeter}\\times100$.\nSubstituting the values, we get: $\\frac{(20.25 - 6)}{6}\\times100 = \\frac{14.25}{6}\\times100 \\approx 2.375\\times100 = 237.5\\%$.\n\nTo find the percent increase to the nearest tenth, round $237.5\\%$ to $\\boxed{237.5\\%}$",
    "To find the percent increase in the perimeter from the first triangle to the fourth triangle, we need to calculate the length of the sides of each triangle and then find the percent increase from the first to the fourth.\n\nThe length of the sides of the first equilateral triangle is 2 units.\n\nFor the second triangle, the length of the sides is 150% of the first, which can be calculated as:\n150% of 2 = (150/100) * 2 = 3 units.\n\nFor the third triangle, the length of the sides is 150% of the second, which can be calculated as:\n150% of 3 = (150/100) * 3 = 4.5 units.\n\nFor the fourth triangle, the length of the sides is 150% of the third, which can be calculated as:\n150% of 4.5 = (150/100) * 4.5 = 6.75 units.\n\nSince all triangles have the same side length, the perimeters will be three times the side length.\n\nPerimeter of the first triangle = 3 * 2 = 6 units.\nPerimeter of the fourth triangle = 3 * 6.75 = 20.25 units.\n\nThe percent increase from the first to the fourth triangle can be calculated as:\n((Perimeter of the fourth triangle - Perimeter of the first triangle) / Perimeter of the first triangle) * 100\n= ((20.25 - 6) / 6) * 100\n= (14.25 / 6) * 100\n= 2.375 * 100\n= 237.5%\n\nThe percent increase in the perimeter is approximately 237.5%. \n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{237.5}$",
    "To find the percent increase in the perimeter from the first triangle to the fourth triangle, we'll first determine the lengths of the sides of the fourth triangle, then find its perimeter, and finally calculate the percent increase.\n\nStep 1: The original triangle has sides of length 2 units.\n\nStep 2: The second equilateral triangle is formed with sides that are $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the first triangle.\nTo find the length of the sides of the second triangle, we multiply the original side length by $1.5$ (which is the same as $150\\%$).\nSo, the sides of the second triangle will be $2 \\cdot 1.5 = 3$ units.\n\nStep 3: The third equilateral triangle is formed with sides that are $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the second triangle.\nTo find the length of the sides of the third triangle, we multiply the side length of the second triangle by $1.5$.\nSo, the sides of the third triangle will be $3 \\cdot 1.5 = 4.5$ units.\n\nStep 4: The fourth equilateral triangle is formed with sides that are $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the third triangle.\nTo find the length of the sides of the fourth triangle, we multiply the side length of the third triangle by $1.5$.\nSo, the sides of the fourth triangle will be $4.5 \\cdot 1.5 = 6.75$ units.\n\nStep 5: Now, we can find the perimeters of the first and fourth triangles by multiplying their side lengths by 3 (since the number of sides of an equilateral triangle is 3).\nThe perimeter of the first triangle is $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ units.\nThe perimeter of the fourth triangle is $6.75 \\cdot 3 = 20.25$ units.\n\nStep 6: To find the percent increase from the first triangle to the fourth triangle, we'll use the following formula:\n$\\text{Percent Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\right) \\times 100 \\%$.\nPlugging in our values, we get:\n$\\text{Percent Increase} = \\left( \\frac{20.25 - 6}{6} \\right) \\times 100 \\% = \\left( \\frac{14.25}{6} \\right) \\times 100 \\% = 2.375 \\times 100 \\% \\approx \\boxed{237.5}\\%$."

  "solution": "If the side length of each successive equilateral triangle is $150\\%$ of the previous triangle, then we can multiply the previous side length by 1.5. We will need to do this three times to get to the fourth triangle, so its side length will be $$1.5^3 = 1.5 \\times 1.5 \\times 1.5 = 3.375$$ times the  original side length. This is the same as $337.5\\%$ of the original side length, which represents a $337.5 - 100 = 237.5\\%$ increase over the original side length. The perimeter is also a length, so it will be affected in the same way. The percent increase in the perimeter is $\\boxed{237.5\\%}$.",
