    "We can start by using the formula for the average, which is the sum of the numbers divided by the total count of numbers.\n\nThe average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ can be written as:\n\n$\\frac{(x+6) + (6x+2) + (2x+7)}{3}$\n\nWe know that this average equals $4x-7$. We can set up the equation as follows:\n\n$\\frac{(x+6) + (6x+2) + (2x+7)}{3} = 4x-7$\n\nTo simplify the left side, we can first find the common denominator for the terms inside the parentheses and add them together, then divide by 3:\n\n$\\frac{(x + 6x + 2x + 6 + 2 + 7)}{3} = 4x-7$\n\nCombine like terms to get:\n\n$\\frac{9x + 15}{3} = 4x-7$\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n$9x + 15 = 12x-21$\n\nNow we can isolate $x$ by moving all the terms involving $x$ to one side of the equation. Subtract $9x$ from both sides:\n\n$15 = 3x-21$\n\nAdd 21 to both sides of the equation:\n\n$36 = 3x$\n\nFinally, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find $x$:\n\n$x = 12$\n\nSo, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "To find the value of x, we need to use the given information about the average of the three expressions.\n\nThe average of three numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 3. In this case, we can write an equation:\n\n((x+6) + (6x+2) + (2x+7)) / 3 = 4x - 7\n\nFirst, we need to simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms:\n\n((x+6) + (6x+2) + (2x+7)) = (x + 6x + 2x) + (6 + 2 + 7)\n= (9x) + 15\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n((9x) + 15) / 3 = 4x - 7\n\nNext, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n(9x + 15) = 3(4x - 7)\n\nNow, let's simplify the right-hand side:\n\n3(4x - 7) = 12x - 21\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n9x + 15 = 12x - 21\n\nNext, let's isolate the variable x by subtracting 9x from both sides and adding 21 to both sides:\n\n15 + 21 = 12x - 9x\n\n36 = 3x\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\nx = 36 / 3\n\nx = 12\n\nTherefore, the value of x is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "To find the value of $x$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. The average of three numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 3. So, the equation becomes $\\frac{(x+6) + (6x+2) + (2x+7)}{3} = 4x-7$.\n\n2. Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction: $(x+6) + (6x+2) + (2x+7) = 3(4x-7)$.\n\n3. Simplify both sides of the equation: $x+6 + 6x+2 + 2x+7 = 12x-21$.\n\n4. Combine like terms on the left-hand side: $9x+15 = 12x-21$.\n\n5. Subtract $9x$ from both sides of the equation to isolate the variable $x$:  $15 = 3x-21$.\n\n6. Add 21 to both sides of the equation to get $15 + 21 = 3x - 21 + 21$: $36 = 3x$.\n\n7. Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for $x$: $x = 12$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{12}$."

  "solution": "The average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $\\dfrac{1}{3}((x+6)+(6x+2)+(2x+7))$. Simplifying this expression gives $\\dfrac{1}{3}(9x+15)=3x+5$. We know the average is also $4x-7$, so $3x+5=4x-7$. Subtracting $3x-7$ from both sides of this equation gives $x=\\boxed{12}$.",
