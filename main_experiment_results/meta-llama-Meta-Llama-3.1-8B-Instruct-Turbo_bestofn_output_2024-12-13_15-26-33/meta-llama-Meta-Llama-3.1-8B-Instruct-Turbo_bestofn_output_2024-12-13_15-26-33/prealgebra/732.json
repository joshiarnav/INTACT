    "To find the total amount of money shared, we first need to determine the portions of Ben and Carlos.\n\nGiven that the portions are in the ratio of 1:2:7 for Amanda, Ben, and Carlos, we can denote the portions as follows: \n- Amanda's portion = 1x\n- Ben's portion = 2x\n- Carlos's portion = 7x\n\nWe are given that Amanda's portion is $\\$$20. Therefore, we can write an equation to solve for x:\n1x = 20\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1, which gives us:\nx = 20\n\nNow that we know the value of x, we can determine Ben's and Carlos's portions:\n- Amanda's portion = 1x = 20\n- Ben's portion = 2x = 2 * 20 = 40\n- Carlos's portion = 7x = 7 * 20 = 140\n\nThe total amount of money shared will be the sum of Amanda's, Ben's, and Carlos's portions:\nTotal = 20 + 40 + 140\nTotal = 200\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money shared is $\\boxed{200}$.",
    "To find the total amount of money shared, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the ratio of Amanda, Ben, and Carlos's portions, which is 1:2:7.\n\n2. We know Amanda's portion is $\\$$20. Since her portion is represented by the number 1 in the ratio, we need to find what 1 unit of money is in this context. We can do this by dividing Amanda's portion by her ratio: \n\n   $1 = 20/1$\n   1 unit of money = $\\$$20.\n\n3. Now that we know 1 unit of money is $\\$$20, we can find Ben and Carlos's portions by multiplying 1 unit by their respective ratios.\n\n   Ben's portion = 2 units = 2 * $\\$$20 = $\\$$40.\n   Carlos's portion = 7 units = 7 * $\\$$20 = $\\$$140.\n\n4. Finally, to find the total amount of money shared, we add Amanda's, Ben's, and Carlos's portions together:\n\n   Total = Amanda's portion + Ben's portion + Carlos's portion\n   = $\\$$20 + $\\$$40 + $\\$$140\n   = $\\$$200.\n\nSo, the total amount of money shared is $\\boxed{\\200}$."

  "solution": "We multiply each part of the ratio $1:2:7$ by 20 to make Amanda's part equal 20, and we have \\[1:2:7 = 1\\cdot 20:2\\cdot 20 :7\\cdot 20 = 20:40:140.\\] This means that  Ben's share is $2\\times 20 = 40$ dollars and Carlos's share is $7\\times 20=140$ dollars.  Therefore, the total amount of money shared is $20+40+140=\\boxed{200}$ dollars.",
