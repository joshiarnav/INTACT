    "To find the area of the shaded region, we need to find the area of the square and subtract the area of the four quarter circles.\n\nStep 1: Find the area of the square.\nThe side length of the square is 10 cm. The area of a square is given by $side^2$. \nSo, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$ square cm.\n\nStep 2: Find the area of the four quarter circles.\nEach quarter circle has a radius of 5 cm (half of the side length of the square). The area of a quarter circle is given by $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi r^2$. \nSo, the area of each quarter circle is $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi (5)^2 = \\frac{25}{4}\\pi$ square cm.\nSince there are four quarter circles, their total area is $4 \\times \\frac{25}{4}\\pi = 25\\pi$ square cm.\n\nStep 3: Find the area of the shaded region.\nTo find the area of the shaded region, we subtract the area of the four quarter circles from the area of the square.\nThe area of the shaded region is $100 - 25\\pi$ square cm.\n\nSo, the area of the shaded region is $\\boxed{100 - 25\\pi}$ square cm.",
    "To find the area of the shaded region, we can first find the area of the entire square and then subtract the areas of the four quarter-circles.\n\nStep 1: Find the area of the square.\nThe area of a square can be found by squaring the length of one of its sides. Since each side of this square is 10cm, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100 \\text{cm}^2$.\n\nStep 2: Find the area of the four quarter-circles.\nTo find the area of the four quarter-circles, we need to find the area of one full circle and then multiply it by 4.\n\nThe radius of each quarter-circle is half the side of the square, which is 5cm. Therefore, the area of one full circle is $\\pi r^2 = \\pi (5)^2 = 25\\pi \\text{ cm}^2$. Since there are four of these circles, the area of the four quarter-circles is $4 \\cdot 25\\pi = 100\\pi \\text{ cm}^2$.\n\nStep 3: Subtract the areas of the four quarter-circles from the area of the square to find the area of the shaded region.\n\n$100\\text{ cm}^2 - 100\\pi\\text{ cm}^2 = \\boxed{100 - 100\\pi} \\text{ cm}^2.$",
    "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the shaded region.\n\nStep 1: Find the area of the square\nThe area of the square is the side length squared. The side length of the square is 10 cm. So the area of the square is:\n$10^2 = 100\\, \\text{cm}^2$\n\nStep 2: Find the area of a quarter circle\nThe area of a circle with radius $r$ is given by $\\pi r^2$. Since a quarter circle has a fourth of the area of a circle with radius $r$, the area of a quarter circle is $\\frac{\\pi r^2}{4}$. In this case, the radius of the quarter circle is half of the side length of the square, which is $\\frac{10}{2} = 5\\, \\text{cm}$. Therefore, the area of a quarter circle is:\n$\\frac{\\pi 5^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi (25)}{4} = \\frac{25\\pi}{4}\\, \\text{cm}^2$\n\nStep 3: Find the area of four quarter circles\nSince there are four quarter circles, the total area of the quarter circles is four times the area of one quarter circle:\n$4 \\cdot \\frac{25\\pi}{4} = 25\\pi\\, \\text{cm}^2$\n\nStep 4: Find the area of the shaded region\nThe area of the shaded region is the area of the square minus the area of the four quarter circles:\n$100 - 25\\pi = 100 - 25\\pi\\, \\text{cm}^2$\n\nSo, in the format $\\boxed{answer}$, the answer is:\n$\\boxed{100 - 25\\pi}$"

  "solution": "We first notice that the area of the shaded region is the area of the square minus the areas of the four quarter circles. Each quarter circle has a radius half the side length, so if we sum the areas of the four quarter circles, we have the area of one full circle with radius $5$ cm. Now, we know the area of a square is the square of its side length, so the square has an area of $100 \\text{ cm}^2$. A circle has an area of $\\pi$ times its radius squared, so the four quarter circles combined have an area of $\\pi(5)^2=25\\pi \\text{ cm}^2$. From this, we know that the area of the shaded region is $\\boxed{100-25\\pi} \\text{ cm}^2$.",
