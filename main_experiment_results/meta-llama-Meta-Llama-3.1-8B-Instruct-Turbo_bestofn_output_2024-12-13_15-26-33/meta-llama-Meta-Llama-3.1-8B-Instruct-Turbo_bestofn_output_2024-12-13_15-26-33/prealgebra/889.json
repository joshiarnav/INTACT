    "To find the area of $\\Delta ABC$, we need to find the length of sides $AB$ and $BC$. We are given that altitude $CD$ is $\\sqrt3$ centimeters.\n\nFirst, let's draw the altitude from $A$ to side $BC$ (denote as $CH$). Notice that since both $\\Delta ACD$ and $\\Delta ABC$ are 30-60-90 triangles, their sides are in the ratio $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$. Since we are given that $CD = \\sqrt{3}$, then we can find the other sides of $\\Delta ACD$ by multiplying by 2. Thus $AC = 2\\cdot2 = 4$.\n\nWe can then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of side $AB$. Since we can apply the 45-45-90 triangle theorem to triangle AHD, we have AH = CH = 2. Applying the 30-60-90 triangle theorem, we know that AB is twice the length of AH, so $AB = 4$.\n\nNow, we need to find the length of side $BC$. Using the same method, $BC = AC \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = 4\\cdot \\sqrt{3} = 4\\sqrt{3}$. \n\nNow that we have both the base and the height of the triangle, we can use the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$ to find the area of $\\Delta ABC$.\nIn this case, $b = 4\\sqrt{3}$ and $h = 4$. Therefore, the area of the triangle is\n$$\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4\\sqrt{3} \\cdot 4 = 8\\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{8\\sqrt{3}}$.",
    "To find the area of triangle ABC, we can use the properties of right triangles within the given triangle.\n\nGiven that altitude $CD$ is $\\sqrt{3}$ centimeters.

    "To find the area of $\\triangle ABC$, we first need to find its base and height. \n\nGiven that $CD$ is $\\sqrt{3}$ centimeters, we know that $\\angle A = 30^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle ACB = 90^{\\circ}$. Therefore, $\\triangle ACD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle.\n\nUsing the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle, we know that the ratio of the sides opposite to these angles is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$. \n\nSince $CD$ is the shorter leg of the triangle, we can set up a ratio to find the length of $AC$. \n\nLet $AC=x$ be the longer leg of the triangle, $CD=y$ be the shorter leg, and $AD=z$ be the hypotenuse. \n\nWe know that $y=x\\sqrt{3}/2$, so $y=\\sqrt{3}$, which gives us $x=2$. \n\nNow let's find the length of $BC$. Triangle $ABC$ is also a 30-60-90 triangle, with $BC$ being the shorter leg. \n\nWe already know the length of the longer leg ($AC=2$) so we can set up the ratio to find $BC$. \n\n$BC=y=(2\\sqrt{3}/2)=\\sqrt{3}$\n\nThe area of $\\triangle ABC$ can now be calculated using the formula $A = (1/2)\\times b \\times h$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height. \n\nHere, $AC$ will be the base and $BC$ will be the height. \n\nTherefore, $[ABC] = (1/2)\\times AC \\times BC = (1/2) \\times 2 \\times \\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}.$"
