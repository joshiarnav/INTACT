    "To find the point in the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$ that is closest to the point $(1,2,3),$ we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the normal vector of the plane**: The coefficients of $x$, $y$, and $z$ in the equation of the plane give the components of the normal vector, which is $\\vec{n} = <3, -4, 5>$.\n\n2. **Find the equation of the line passing through the point and perpendicular to the plane**: The direction vector of the line is the same as the normal vector, and the point it passes through is $(1, 2, 3)$.

    "To find the point in the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$ that is closest to the point $(1,2,3),$ we will use the following steps:\n\n## Step 1: Find the normal vector of the plane\nThe equation of the plane is $3x - 4y + 5z = 30.$ The coefficients of x, y, and z give the components of the normal vector to the plane. Therefore, the normal vector is $\\mathbf{n} = \\langle 3, -4, 5\\rangle.$\n\n## Step 2: Find a point on the plane\nTo find a point on the plane, we can set two of the variables to be arbitrary values and solve for the third variable. Let $x = 0.$ Then, the equation of the plane becomes $-4y + 5z = 30.$ Let $y = 0.$ Then, the equation becomes $z = 30/5 = 6.$ Therefore, the point $(0,0,6)$ lies on the plane.\n\n## Step 3: Find the equation of the line passing through the point (1,2,3) and perpendicular to the plane\nThe direction vector of this line is given by the normal vector of the plane, which is $\\mathbf{n} = \\langle 3, -4, 5\\rangle.$ The parametric equation of the line is $\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{r_0} + t\\mathbf{n} = \\langle 1,2,3\\rangle + t\\langle 3,-4,5\\rangle = \\langle 1 + 3t, 2 - 4t, 3 + 5t\\rangle.$\n\n## Step 4: Find the intersection of the line with the plane\nWe plug in the parametric equation of the line into the equation of the plane and solve for t:\n$3(1 + 3t) -  Hits - 30 + 5(3 + 5t) = 30$\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n$3 + 9t - 4t + 15 + 25t = 30$\nCombine like terms, we get:\n$30 + 30t = 30$\nSubtract 30 from both sides, we get:\n$30t = 0$\nDivide by 30, we get:\n$t = 0$\n\n## Step 5: Find the point of intersection of the line and the plane\nSubstitute t = 0 into the parametric equation of the line to find the point of intersection:\n$\\mathbf{r}(0) = \\langle 1 + 3(0), 2 - 4(0), 3 + 5(0)\\rangle = \\langle 1, 2, 3\\rangle.$ However, the closest point to (1,2,3) lies on the line and must satisfy the plane's equation. The closest point will be found at an intersection off of the original point so, t will be used in the next step.\n\n## Step 6: Since $t = 0$ does not provide an intersection off of the original point, this requires solving the equation for t using the equations found from the substitution of the plane equation into the parametric equation.\n$3(1 + 3t) - 4(2 - 4t) + 5(3 + 5t) = 30$\n$3 + 9t - 8 + 16t + 15 + 25t = 30$\nAdding 1 to both sides and combining like terms gives us:\n$50t = 22$\nDividing both sides by 50 provides:\n$t = \\frac{22}{50} = \\frac{11}{25}$\n\n## Step 7: Substitute t into the equation to find the closest point on the line\nSubstitute $t = \\frac{11}{25}$ into the parametric equation of the line:\n$\\mathbf{r} = \\langle 1 + 3\\left( \\frac{11}{25} \\right), 2 - 4\\left( \\frac{11}{25} \\right), 3 + 5\\left( \\frac{11}{25} \\right)\\rangle$\n$\\mathbf{r} = \\langle 1 + \\frac{33}{25}, 2 - \\frac{44}{25}, 3 + \\frac{55}{25}\\rangle$\n$\\mathbf{r} = \\langle \\frac{25}{25} + \\frac{33}{25}, \\frac{50}{25} - \\frac{44}{25}, \\frac{75}{25} + \\frac{55}{25}\\rangle$\n$\\mathbf{r} = \\langle \\frac{58}{25}, \\frac{6}{25}, \\frac{130}{25}\\rangle$\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the point to fit the required answer format\n$\\mathbf{r} = \\boxed{\\left(\\frac{58}{25}, \\frac{6}{25}, \\frac{130}{25}\\right)}$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{58}{25}, \\frac{6}{25}, \\frac{130}{25}\\right)}$"
