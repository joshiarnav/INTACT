    "To find the point in the $xz$-plane that is equidistant from the given points, we start by noting that any point in the $xz$-plane will have the form $(x,0,z)$. \n\nWe will now apply the formula for the distance between two points in 3D space: \n\\[D = \\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2}.\\]\n\nThe distance from the point $(x,0,z)$ to the first point $(1,-1,0)$ is\n\\[\\sqrt{(x-1)^2+(0-(-1))^2+(z-0)^2}.\\]\n\nThe distance from the point $(x,0,z)$ to the second point $(2,1,2)$ is\n\\[\\sqrt{(x-2)^2+(0-1)^2+(z-2)^2}.\\]\n\nThe distance from the point $(x,0,z)$ to the third point $(3,2,-1)$ is\n\\[\\sqrt{(x-3)^2+(0-2)^2+(z-(-1))^2}.\\]\n\nAs the point in the $xz$-plane is equidistant from the three given points, each of these distances must be equal. \n\nEquating the first two distances, we get\n\\[\\sqrt{(x-1)^2+(0-(-1))^2+(z-0)^2} = \\sqrt{(x-2)^2+(0-1)^2+(z-2)^2}.\\]\n\nSquaring both sides, we get\n\\[(x-1)^2+(0-(-1))^2+(z-0)^2 = (x-2)^2+(0-1)^2+(z-2)^2.\\]\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get\n\\[x^2-2x+1+1+z^2 = x^2 -4x+4 +1+z^2-4z+4.\\]\n\nCanceling like terms, we get\n\\[-2x+2 = -4x+3-4z+4.\\]\n\nCollecting like terms, we get\n\\[2x-2 = 4x-4z-1.\\]\n\nSubtracting $2x$ from both sides, we get\n\\[-2 = 2x-4z-1.\\]\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides, we get\n\\[-4 = 2x-4z-3.\\]\n\nAdding $4z+3$ to both sides, we get\n\\[4z+3-4 = 2x.\\]\n\nSimplifying the left-hand side, we get\n\\[4z-1 = 2x.\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get\n\\[2z-\\frac{1}{2} = x.\\]\n\nEquating the first and third distances, we get\n\\[\\sqrt{(x-1)^2+(0-(-1))^2+(z-0)^2} = \\sqrt{(x-3)^2+(0-2)^2+(z-(-1))^2}.\\]\n\nSquaring both sides, we get\n\\[(x-1)^2+(0-(-1))^2+(z-0)^2 = (x-3)^2+(0-2)^2+(z+1)^2.\\]\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get\n\\[x^2-2x+1+1+z^2 = x^2 -6x+9 +4+z^2+2z+1.\\]\n\nCanceling like terms, we get\n\\[x^2-2x+2 = x^2-6x+14+2z.\\]\n\nSubtracting $x^2$ from both sides, we get\n\\[-2x+2 = -6x+14+2z.\\]\n\nCollecting like terms, we get\n\\[4x-2 = 2z+12.\\]\n\nAdding 2 to both sides, we get\n\\[4x = 2z+14.\\]\n\nSubtracting 14 from both sides, we get\n\\[4x-14 = 2z.\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get\n\\[2x-7 = z.\\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for $z$ obtained in the first case into the equation obtained in the second case, we get\n\\[2(2z-\\frac{1}{2})-7 = z.\\]\n\nSimplifying the left-hand side, we get\n\\[4z-1-7 = z.\\]\n\nCombining the constants, we get\n\\[4z-8 = z.\\]\n\nSubtracting $z$ from both sides, we get\n\\[3z-8 = 0.\\]\n\nAdding 8 to both sides, we get\n\\[3z = 8.\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get\n\\[z = \\frac{8}{3}.\\]\n\nSubstituting this expression into the equation obtained in the first case, we get\n\\[x = 2z-\\frac{1}{2}.\\]\n\nSubstituting $z = \\frac{8}{3}$, we get\n\\[x = 2(\\frac{8}{3})-\\frac{1}{2}.\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficient and the first term, we get\n\\[x = \\frac{16}{3}-\\frac{1}{2}.\\]\n\nTo add or subtract fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 2 is 6. \n\nMultiplying the first fraction by $\\frac{2}{2}$, we get\n\\[x = \\frac{32}{6}-\\frac{3}{6}.\\]\n\nCombining the fractions, we get\n\\[x = \\frac{29}{6}.\\]\n\nTherefore, the point in the $xz$-plane that is equidistant from the points $(1,-1,0),$ $(2,1,2),$ and $(3,2,-1)$ is\n\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{29}{6},0,\\frac{8}{3}\\right)}.",
