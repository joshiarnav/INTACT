    "To solve for the sum of all possible values of $BC,$ we need to use the Law of Sines and the properties of right and oblique triangles.\n\nStep 1: Let's start by drawing triangle $ABC$ with given information.\n\nStep 2: The Law of Sines states that for any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant. \n\n$\\frac{AB}{\\sin C} = \\frac{AC}{\\sin B} = \\frac{BC}{\\sin A}.$\n\nStep 3: In our problem, we know $AB = 150$, $AC = 50 \\sqrt{3}$ and $\\angle B = 30^\\circ.$ To use the Law of Sines, we need angle $A.$ Since $\\angle B = 30^\\circ,$ we can apply the property of a 30-60-90 triangle to find angle $C$, which is $60^\\circ$. Knowing that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can solve for angle $A$ in two cases - either as $180 - 30 - 60 = 90$ or as $180 - 30 - 90 = 60.$\n\n- Case 1: $\\angle A = 90^\\circ.$ In this scenario, $AC = 50\\sqrt{3}$ which is the length of the side opposite to the $30^\\circ$ angle, hence we have another 30-60-90 triangle. Therefore, the length of side $BC$ is given by $AB = 150.$\n\n- Case 2: $\\angle A = 60^\\circ.$ However, this would make $BC$ both the hypotenuse and the side adjacent to the $30^\\circ$ angle in a triangle, so it must be the side opposite to the $60^\\circ$ angle, which would be a $30-60-90$ triangle. Therefore, the length of the side $BC$ is $2 \\cdot 50 \\sqrt{3} = 100 \\sqrt{3}.$\n\nStep 4: To get the sum of all possible values of $BC,$ we need to add the results of the two cases.\n\nSum = 150 + 100$\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{150 + 100\\sqrt{3}}$",
