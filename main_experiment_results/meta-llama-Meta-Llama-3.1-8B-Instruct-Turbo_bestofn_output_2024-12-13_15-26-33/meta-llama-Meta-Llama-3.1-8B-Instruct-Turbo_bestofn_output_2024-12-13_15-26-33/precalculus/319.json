    "To solve this problem, we can first visualize the given cube and label the vertices.  Let's denote the cube's sides as $a, b, c$. It follows that the four vertices above the plane are $A, B, C, D$ in the order from bottom to top. \n\nWe denote the vertex closest to the plane as $A$. The three adjacent vertices to $A$ are labeled as $A$, $E$, $F$, and $G$ in the order from bottom to top. We have that $AE = AF = AG = 10$, $BE = BF = BG = 10\\sqrt{2}$, and $EF = EG = FG = 10\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nNext, we form a vector $\\vec{AE}$ from $A$ to $E$. We denote the distance of $A$ from the plane as $h$. The equation of the plane can be represented as:\n\n$$10 + 10\\sqrt{2}\\cdot x + 10\\sqrt{2}\\cdot y + 10\\sqrt{3}\\cdot z - h = 0$$\n\nwhere $x, y, z$ are the coordinates of point $E$.\n\nWe now need to find $\\vec{n}$, the unit normal vector of the cube. It is orthogonal to the face containing $E$ and is perpendicular to the edges coming out of $E$. This tells us that the unit normal vector $\\vec{n}$ of the cube is given by:\n\n$$\\vec{n} = \\frac{1}{10} (10, 10\\sqrt{2}, 10\\sqrt{3})$$\n\nWe take the dot product between this and the plane equation to find the value of $h$. As we let $D$ be the projection of $D$ onto the plane, with midpoint $M$, we get that the distance of point $D$ from the plane $h = \\frac{69 - \\sqrt{3451}}{11}$.\n\nTherefore our solution is $r+s+t= 69+3451+11 = \\boxed{4531}$.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to first visualize the scenario and establish a coordinate system for the cube. \n\nWe will place vertex $A$ at the origin and the three vertices adjacent to $A$ at \\begin{align*}\n(10,0,0),\\quad\n(0,10,0), \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n(0,0,10).\n\\end{align*}\nThe equation of the plane containing the points $(10,0,0), (0,10,0),$ and $(0,0,10)$ can be derived from the cross product of the vectors representing the plane, giving \\begin{align*}\n -10x + 10y + 10z &= d\\\\ d &=100\\\\\n \\text{The final result for the equation of the plane is } -x+y+z &= 10.\n\\end{align*}\nUsing the point (10,0,0), the equation of the plane to the given vertex above point A is $$-10+10+y=10+10,  $$ which simplifies to$$y =20.$$ In this case, d was the distance of 20 \\begin{align*} \nSubstituting the points (11,0,0), (0,11,0), and (0,0,11) into the plane equation, we get\nd= 21, d = 21, and d  = 21.\nWe construct a line segment from vertex A to the plane and label the feet of this line segment on the plane as point P. The area of triangle APD (containing vertices A, P, and D) will be parallel to the plane equation.\nWe then evaluate two alternative planes: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{First plane } x \\quad &+y+z=40,  \\\\\n\\text{Second plane} & \\text{ } \n    -2x \\quad  +y+2z = 30.\n\\end{align*} Similarly, substitution of the point (11,0,0), (0,11,0), and (0,0,11) into the two plane equations yields values of d= 31, d= 31, and d = 31. Now, let P' be the foot of the line segment from the point (11,0,0) to the first plane, and P'' be the foot of the line segment from the point (11,0,0) to the second plane.\n\nNow we evaluate the planes represented by AP' and AP'' \\begin{align*}\n\\text{Plane represented by AP'  }  &\\left( 5  \\right) \\text{ } 11  \\left( 1 \\right) & \n   12 &   1 &    \n & & & &\\\\\n  & &   15   &    5 &     1 \\\\\n & &   15    &    5     &   1 &\\\\\n\\text{The resulting result is }\\left( 1 \\right) \\text{  }  & -6  & -11  & -15\\\\  -\\sqrt{346} & & &  \\\\\n   & & \\frac{61-\\sqrt{346}}{6}\n\\end{align*}\nWe find the distance to the original plane (with the equation  -x+y+z = 10) by noting that $\\frac{61-\\sqrt{346}}{6}$ is equal to the distance to first plane x \\quad  +y+z=40.
