However, I will evaluate them based on clarity, concision, and adherence to mathematical notation.\n\nSolution 1 is clear and concise, but it could benefit from using the dot product notation more explicitly.\n\nSolution 2 is very similar to Solution 1 and also clear and concise.\n\nSolution 3 is perhaps the most straightforward and easy to follow, as it explicitly states the components of the dot product and clearly sets up and solves the equation.\n\nBased on these criteria, I would say that Solution 3 is the best solution.\n\nThe index number of the best solution is: 3",
