    "To compute the product of two matrices, we need to multiply the elements of each row of the first matrix with the elements of each column of the second matrix.\n\nGiven two matrices:\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 5 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 8 & -2 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe'll compute the product in the following way:\n\nFirst, multiply each element in the first row of the first matrix with the corresponding elements in the first column of the second matrix, and add them up:\n\n$2 \\cdot 8 + 0 \\cdot 1 = 16 + 0 = 16$\n\nFor the element at position (1,2) of the resulting matrix, multiply each element in the first row of the first matrix with the corresponding elements in the second column of the second matrix, and add them up:\n\n$2 \\cdot -2 + 0 \\cdot 1 = -4 + 0 = -4$\n\nNow, multiply each element in the second row of the first matrix with the corresponding elements in the first column of the second matrix, and add them up:\n\n$5 \\cdot 8 + -3 \\cdot 1 = 40 - 3 = 37$\n\nFor the element at position (2,2) of the resulting matrix, multiply each element in the second row of the first matrix with the corresponding elements in the second column of the second matrix, and add them up:\n\n$5 \\cdot -2 + -3 \\cdot 1 = -10 - 3 = -13$\n\nTherefore, the product of the two matrices is:\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 16 & -4 \\\\ 37 & -13 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nIn the requested format, the answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 16 & -4 \\\\ 37 & -13 \\end{pmatrix}}$",
    "To compute the product of two matrices, we follow these steps:\n\n1. We need to have the same number of rows in the first matrix as the number of columns in the second matrix. In this case, the first matrix has 2 rows and 2 columns, and the second matrix also has 2 rows and 2 columns, so the product is possible.\n\n2. We take each element of the first row of the first matrix and multiply it by the corresponding element of the first column of the second matrix. We add these results together to get the element in the first row and first column of the resulting matrix.\n\n3. We repeat step 2 for the first row and second column of the second matrix.\n\n4. We then repeat steps 2 and 3 for the second row of the first matrix.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- For the first row and first column of the resulting matrix: \n  (2 * 8) + (0 * 1) = 16 + 0 = 16\n- For the first row and second column of the resulting matrix: \n  (2 * -2) + (0 * 1) = -4 + 0 = -4\n- For the second row and first column of the resulting matrix: \n  (5 * 8) + (-3 * 1) = 40 - 3 = 37\n- For the second row and second column of the resulting matrix: \n  (5 * -2) + (-3 * 1) = -10 - 3 = -13\n\nThe resulting matrix is then:\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 16 & -4 \\\\ 37 & -13 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSo our answer is: $\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 16 & -4 \\\\ 37 & -13 \\end{pmatrix}}$",
