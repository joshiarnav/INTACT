    "To find the complex number that $2i$ is mapped to under the given dilation, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the vector from the center of dilation to the original point:\nIn this case, the center of dilation is $-1 + 4i$, and the original point is $2i$. Subtracting the center from the point gives us the vector:\n\nVector = $(2i) - (-1 + 4i)$\n= $-1 + 6i$\n\n2. Multiply the vector by the scale factor:\nThe scale factor is $-2$, so multiplying the vector by this factor gives us:\n\n$(2i) - (-1 + 4i)$ * $(-2)$\n= $(-2)(-1) + (-2)(6i)$\n= $2 - 12i$\n\n3. Find the new point by adding the scaled vector to the center of dilation:\nFinally, we need to add the scaled vector to the center of dilation to find the new point:\n\nNew Point = Center of dilation + Scaled Vector\n= $-1 + 4i + 2 - 12i$\n= $1 - 8i$\n\nSo, the $2i$ under the given dilation is mapped to $\\boxed{1 - 8i}$.",
    "To find the complex number that $2i$ is mapped to under this dilation, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the center and scale factor**: The dilation is centered at $-1 + 4i$ with a scale factor of $-2$. This means that any complex number $z$ is mapped to $-2(z - (-1 + 4i))$.\n\n2. **Translate the complex number $2i$ to the center $-1 + 4i$**: We need to find the difference between $2i$ and $-1 + 4i$, which is $(-1 + 4i) - 2i = -1 + 2i$.\n\n3. **Multiply by the scale factor**: Now we multiply the translated difference by the scale factor: $-2 \\cdot (-1 + 2i) = 2 - 4i$.\n\n4. **Translate back to the original position**: To find the position of $2i$ after the dilation, we need to add the difference $-1 + 4i$ back to the center: $(2 - 4i) + (-1 + 4i) = \\boxed{1}$.\n\nSo the complex number that $2i$ is mapped to is $\\boxed{1}$.",
