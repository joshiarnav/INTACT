    "Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is equal to 0. The dot product of two vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix}$ is $ac + bd$. \n\nFor the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$, the dot product is $2x + (5)(-3)$. \n\nTo find the value of $x$ that makes these vectors orthogonal, we set the dot product equal to 0: \n\n$2x + (5)(-3) = 0$\n\nFirst, we multiply: \n$2x - 15 = 0$\n\nNext, we solve for $x$ by adding 15 to both sides: \n$2x = 15$\n\nFinally, we divide both sides by 2: \n$x = \\frac{15}{2}$\n\nSo, $x = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{2}}$.",
