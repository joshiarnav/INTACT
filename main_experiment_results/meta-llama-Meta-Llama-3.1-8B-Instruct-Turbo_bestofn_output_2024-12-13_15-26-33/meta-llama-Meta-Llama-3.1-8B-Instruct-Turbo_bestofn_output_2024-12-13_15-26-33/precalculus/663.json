    "To find the period of $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, we need to understand the properties of the cosine function. The period of a cosine function in the form $y = \\cos ax$ is given by $\\frac{2\\pi}{|a|}$, where $|a|$ is the absolute value of the coefficient of $x$.\n\nIn the given function $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, the coefficient of $x$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$. So, we can apply the formula to find the period.\n\nThe period is given by $\\frac{2\\pi}{|a|} = \\frac{2\\pi}{|\\frac{1}{2}|} = 2\\pi \\times 2 = 4\\pi$.\n\nTherefore, the period of the function $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$ is $\\boxed{4\\pi}$.",
    "To find the period of $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, we need to recall the general formula for the period of a cosine function, which is $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{|b|}$, where $b$ is the coefficient of $x$.\n\nIn the given function, the coefficient of $x$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nHowever, to fit it to the general formula, it would be better to write the function as $y = \\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)$ or $y = \\cos(x/2)$. In general the b value here is $1/2$ and there is no absolute value.\n\nSo, the period of the function is $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\nNow we can simplify the expression:\n\n$T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\frac{1}{2}}$\n\nMultiply both the numerator and denominator by 2 to get rid of the fraction in the denominator:\n\n$T = 2\\pi * 2$\n\nNow multiply:\n\n$T = 4\\pi$\n\nTherefore, the period of the function $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$ is $\\boxed{4\\pi}$.",
    "To find the period of $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, we need to recall the general form of the cosine function, which is $y = A \\cos (Bx + C)$. The period of this function is $\\frac{2\\pi}{|B|}$.\n\nIn the given function $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, we can identify that it is in the form $y = A \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, where $B = \\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nNow, we substitute the value of $B$ into the period formula: $\\frac{2\\pi}{\\left|\\frac{1}{2}\\right|} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\frac{1}{2}}$\n\nSimplifying the fraction by multiplying the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator, we get: $2\\pi \\times \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\\pi \\times \\frac{\\frac{2}{1}}{\\frac{1}{2}}$\n\nCancel out the common factors to simplify the multiplication: $2\\pi \\times \\frac{\\frac{2}{1}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\\pi \\times 4$\n\nNow, let's do the multiplication: $2\\pi \\times 4 = 8\\pi$\n\nTherefore, the period of the function $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$ is $\\boxed{8\\pi}$."
