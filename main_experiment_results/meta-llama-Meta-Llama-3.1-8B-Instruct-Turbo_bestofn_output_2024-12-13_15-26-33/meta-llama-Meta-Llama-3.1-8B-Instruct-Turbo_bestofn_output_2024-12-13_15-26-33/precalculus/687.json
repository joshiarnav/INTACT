    "To find the sum of the squares of the side lengths of triangle $ABC$ given the sum of the squares of the distances from the centroid $G$ to each vertex, we can use the relationship between centroid, medians, and side lengths of a triangle.\n\nGiven:\n- $GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = 58$\n\nWe know that the centroid $G$ divides the median in a $2:1$ ratio, with the longer part being from the vertex to the centroid.\n\n1. **From the property of the centroid:** We recall that the following equation applies: \n\n$$GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = \\frac{AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2}{3}.$$\n\n2. **Applying the formula:** To find the desired result, multiply both sides by 3:\n\n$$3(GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2) = AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2.$$\n\n3. **Solving for the desired expression:** Given that $GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = 58,$:\n\n$$3(58) = AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$$\n$$3 \\times 58 = 174$$\n\nTherefore:\n- The sum of the squares of the side lengths of triangle $ABC$ is:\n$\\boxed{174}$",
    "To solve this problem, we can use a well-known property of the centroid in a triangle.\n\nStep 1:  Recall that the centroid (G) of a triangle is the point of intersection of the three medians of the triangle. The medians are the line segments joining each vertex of the triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side.\nStep 2:  If we draw the three medians of triangle ABC and mark the centroid G, we can apply the following property:\n  Step 2.1: The centroid divides each median into two segments, with the segment connected to the vertex being twice as long as the segment connected to the midpoint of the opposite side.\nStep 3:  This means that, if we draw any median and mark its intersection with the opposite side as M, then the length of GM is 2/3 of the length of the median segment connected to the vertex.\nStep 4:  Recall that, according to the property of the centroid, we have the equation: $GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = \\frac{1}{3}(AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2).$\nStep 5:  We are given that $GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = 58.$\nStep 6:  Substituting this value into the equation above, we get: $\\frac{1}{3}(AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2) = 58.$\nStep 7:  To solve for $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in: $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2 = 3 \\cdot 58 = 174.$\nStep 8:  Therefore, $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2 = \\boxed{174}$",
    "To find the relationship between $GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2$ and $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2,$ let's consider the properties of the centroid in a triangle. \n\nThe centroid ($G$) divides the medians of a triangle into two segments, with the segment connected to the vertex being twice as long as the segment connected to the midpoint of the opposite side. Additionally, the centroid is equidistant from the vertices of a triangle, meaning it's the point where the triangle balances.\n\nRecall the relation: \n$GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = \\frac{1}{3}(AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2)$.\n\nThis relation is well known in geometry and can be derived from the fact that the centroid divides the medians into segments with a 2:1 ratio.\n\nGiven $GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 = 58$, we can substitute this into the equation above to solve for $AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$.\n\n$58 = \\frac{1}{3}(AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2)$\n \nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n$174 = AB^2 + AC^2 + BC^2$\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{174}$."
