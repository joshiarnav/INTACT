    "To find $|z|$, we can use the fact that $|wz| = |w| |z|$ for any complex numbers $w$ and $z$. \n\nGiven $wz = 12 - 8i$, and $|w| = \\sqrt{13}$, we can first find the absolute value of $wz$, which is $|wz| = \\sqrt{(12)^2 + (-8)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 64} = \\sqrt{208} = \\sqrt{4\\cdot 52} = 2 \\sqrt{52} = 4\\sqrt{13}$.\n\nNow we can use the formula $|wz| = |w| |z|$ and rearrange it to find $|z|$:\n$|z| = \\frac{|wz|}{|w|}$\n\nSubstitute the values we know:\n$|z| = \\frac{4\\sqrt{13}}{\\sqrt{13}}$\n\nSimplify the fraction by cancelling out the common factor:\n$|z| = \\boxed{4}$",
    "To find $|z|$, we'll start by using the given information. We have $wz = 12-8i$ and $|w| = \\sqrt{13}$. The magnitude of a complex number $a + bi$ is given by $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. \n\nSince $wz = 12-8i$, we can find $|wz|$ by $\\sqrt{12^2 + (-8)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 64} = \\sqrt{208} = \\sqrt{16\\cdot13} = 4\\sqrt{13}$.\n\nNow we use the property $|wz| = |w|\\cdot |z|$ for any complex numbers $w$ and $z$. So, we have $|wz| = 4\\sqrt{13}$ and $|w|\\cdot |z| = 4\\sqrt{13}$. \n\nSince we know $|w| = \\sqrt{13}$, we have $\\sqrt{13}\\cdot |z| = 4\\sqrt{13}$. To find $|z|$, we can divide both sides by $\\sqrt{13}$.\n\n$|z| = \\frac{4\\sqrt{13}}{\\sqrt{13}} = 4.$ \n\nSo, $|z| = \\boxed{4}$."
