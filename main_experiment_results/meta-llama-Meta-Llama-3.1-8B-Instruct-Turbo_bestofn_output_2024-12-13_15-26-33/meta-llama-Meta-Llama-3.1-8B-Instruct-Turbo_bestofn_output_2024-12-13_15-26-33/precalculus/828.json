    "To find the angle between the vectors $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1. **Original angle**: The original angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is $43^\\circ$.\n\n2. **Reflection and negative vectors**: When we reflect a vector (flip it over), its angle with another vector is mirrored. Since $-\\mathbf{a}$ is a reflection of $\\mathbf{a}$, the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ will be the same as the angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $-\\mathbf{b}$. However, we don't need this information here.\n\n3. **Direction of negative vectors**: For the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, note that $-\\mathbf{a}$ points in the opposite direction of $\\mathbf{a}$. \n\n4. **Final angle**: Given the original angle is 43 degrees and that $-\\mathbf{a}$ points the opposite way to $\\mathbf{a}$, the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is simply $180 - 43 = 137^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: $\\boxed{137}$",
    "To find the angle between the vectors $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, we can use the fact that the angle between two vectors is the same as the angle formed by reflecting one vector onto the other.\n\nSince the angle between the vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is $43^\\circ$, we can reflect vector $\\mathbf{a}$ to obtain $-\\mathbf{a}$. The angle between the reflected vector and the original vector is still the same.\n\nTherefore, the angle between the vectors $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is $\\boxed{180^\\circ - 43^\\circ}$, which simplifies to $\\boxed{137^\\circ}$.",
    "To find the angle between the vectors $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, we need to consider the relationship between the original angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ and the new angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$.\n\nWhen you multiply a vector by a negative scalar, you essentially reflect the vector across the origin. This reflection changes the direction of the vector, but not its magnitude.\n\nSince the angle between two vectors is determined by the dot product formula, $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = |\\mathbf{a}| |\\mathbf{b}| \\cos(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the vectors, we can rewrite the dot product formula for $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ as:\n\n$(-\\mathbf{a}) \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = |\\mathbf{a}| |\\mathbf{b}| \\cos(\\theta)$\n\nSince the magnitudes of $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{a}$ are the same, we can rewrite this as:\n\n$\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = |\\mathbf{a}| |\\mathbf{b}| \\cos(\\theta)$\n\nComparing this with the original dot product formula, we can see that the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the same as the angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$.\n\nTherefore, the angle between the vectors $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is also $43^\\circ$.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{43}$"
