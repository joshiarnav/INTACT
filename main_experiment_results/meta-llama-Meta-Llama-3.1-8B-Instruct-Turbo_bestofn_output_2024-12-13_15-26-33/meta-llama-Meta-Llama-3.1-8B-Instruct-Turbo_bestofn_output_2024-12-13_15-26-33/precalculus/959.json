    "To find the point where the line intersects the xy-plane, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the direction vector of the line by subtracting the coordinates of the first point from the coordinates of the second point:\n\nDirection vector = (5 - 3, 1 - 4, 6 - 1) = (2, -3, 5)\n\n2. The parametric equations of the line can be written as:\n\nx = 3 + 2t\ny = 4 - 3t\nz = 1 + 5t\n\nwhere t is a parameter.\n\n3. To find the point where the line intersects the xy-plane, we need to substitute z = 0 into the parametric equations:\n\n0 = 1 + 5t\n\n4. Solve for t:\n\nt = -1/5\n\n5. Substitute t into the parametric equations for x and y:\n\nx = 3 + 2(-1/5)\ny = 4 - 3(-1/5)\n\n6. Simplify the equations:\n\nx = 3 - 2/5\ny = 4 + 3/5\n\nx = (15 - 2)/5\ny = (20 + 3)/5\n\nx = 13/5\ny = 23/5\n\nSo, the point where the line intersects the xy-plane is ((13/5), (23/5), 0).\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{(13/5, 23/5, 0)}$",
