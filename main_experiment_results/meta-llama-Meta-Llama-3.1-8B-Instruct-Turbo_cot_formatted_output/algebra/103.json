    "solution": "We only need to worry about the terms that multiply to have a degree of $2$. This would be given by the product of the terms $3x^2$ and $-4$ as well as the product of the terms $-2x$ and $-7x$. Thus, $$(3x^2) \\times (-4) + (-2x) \\times (-7x) = -12x^2 + 14x^2 = 2x^2,$$and the coefficient is $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion of the product, we need to multiply the two polynomials and identify the terms with $x^2$. \n\nFirst, let's write down the two polynomials:\n\n$(ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)$\n$(bx^2 - 7x - 4)$\n\nNow, let's multiply each term of the first polynomial by each term of the second polynomial:\n\n$(ax^3)(bx^2) = abx^5$\n$(ax^3)(-7x) = -7ax^4$\n$(ax^3)(-4) = -4ax^3$\n$(3x^2)(bx^2) = 3bx^4$\n$(3x^2)(-7x) = -21x^3$\n$(3x^2)(-4) = -12x^2$\n$(-2x)(bx^2) = -2bx^3$\n$(-2x)(-7x) = 14x^2$\n$(-2x)(-4) = 8x$\n\nNow, let's identify the terms with $x^2$. We have $-12x^2$ and $14x^2$. The coefficient of the $x^2$ term is the sum of these two terms, which is $-12 + 14 = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is $\\boxed{2}$."
