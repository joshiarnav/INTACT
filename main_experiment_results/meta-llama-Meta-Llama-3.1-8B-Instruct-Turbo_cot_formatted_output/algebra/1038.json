    "problem": "What is the greatest integer $n$ such that $n^2 - 11n +24 \\leq 0$?",
    "solution": "We can factor $n^2-11n+24$ as $(n-3)(n-8)$. For this quantity to be less than or equal to 0, one of the factors must be less than or equal to 0 and the other factor must be greater than or equal to 0. Specifically, since $n-8<n-3$ for all $n$, we must have $$n-8 \\le 0 \\le n-3.$$ The first inequality, $n-8\\le 0$, tells us that $n\\le 8$. The second inequality, $0\\le n-3$, tells us that $n\\ge 3$. The solutions to the original inequality must satisfy both conditions, so they are given by $3\\le n\\le 8$. The largest integer in this interval is $n=\\boxed{8}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve the inequality $n^2 - 11n +24 \\leq 0$, we need to factorize the quadratic expression.\n\nThe expression can be factorized as $(n-8)(n-3) \\leq 0$.\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $n$ for which this inequality is true. \n\nTo do this, we can use a number line. We plot the points $n=3$ and $n=8$ on the number line.\n\nSince the inequality is of the form $(n-8)(n-3) \\leq 0$, we need to find the intervals where the expression is less than or equal to zero.\n\nFrom the number line, we can see that the expression is less than or equal to zero in the interval $3 \\leq n \\leq 8$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest integer $n$ such that $n^2 - 11n +24 \\leq 0$ is $\\boxed{8}$."
