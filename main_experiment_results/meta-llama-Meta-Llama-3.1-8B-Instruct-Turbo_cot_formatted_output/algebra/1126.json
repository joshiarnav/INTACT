    "solution": "There is a vertical asymptote where the denominator equals 0 and thus $y$ is undefined. For the denominator to equal 0, we have $5x-7=0\\Rightarrow x=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the vertical asymptote, we need to determine the value of $x$ that makes the denominator of the fraction equal to zero. \n\nThe denominator is $5x-7$. \n\nTo find the value of $x$ that makes the denominator equal to zero, we need to solve the equation:\n\n$5x-7=0$\n\nFirst, let's add 7 to both sides:\n\n$5x = 7$\n\nNow, let's divide both sides by 5:\n\n$x = 7/5$\n\nSo, the value of $x$ that makes the denominator equal to zero is $7/5$. This is where the vertical asymptote occurs.\n\nIn the format you requested:\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{7}{5}}$"
