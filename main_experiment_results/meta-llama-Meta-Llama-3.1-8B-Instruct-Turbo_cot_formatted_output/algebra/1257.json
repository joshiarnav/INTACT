    "problem": "Given that $f(x) = x^k$ where $k < 0$, what is the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$?",
    "solution": "We are looking at the range of $f(x)$ when $x$ is in the interval $[1,\\infty)$. Because $k < 0$, $f(x)$ is decreasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. We see that $f(1) = 1^k = 1$, and as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ approaches 0, but never reaches it.  Hence, on the interval $[1,\\infty)$, $f(x)$ takes on all values between 0 (exclusive) and 1 inclusive, which means the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{(0,1]}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$, we need to analyze the behavior of the function $f(x) = x^k$ where $k < 0$.\n\n1. **Identify the function type**: Since $k < 0$, $f(x)$ is a decreasing function. This is because as $x$ increases, $x^k$ decreases when $k$ is negative.\n\n2. **Determine the behavior at the lower bound**: At $x = 1$, $f(1) = 1^k = 1$. Since $k < 0$, $1^k = 1$.\n\n3. **Determine the behavior as $x$ approaches infinity**: As $x$ approaches infinity, $x^k$ approaches $0$ when $k < 0$. This is because a negative exponent causes the function to decrease towards zero as the base increases.\n\n4. **Determine the range**: Since the function is decreasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ and approaches $0$ as $x$ approaches infinity, the range of $f(x)$ is $(0, f(1)] = (0, 1]$.\n\nTherefore, the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ is $\\boxed{(0, 1]}$."
