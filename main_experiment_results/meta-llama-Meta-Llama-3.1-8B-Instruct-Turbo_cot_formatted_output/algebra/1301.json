    "problem": "Phoenix hiked the Rocky Path Trail last week. It took four days to complete the trip. The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles. The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day. The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles. The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles. How many miles long was the trail?",
    "solution": "Let the number of miles Phoenix hiked in each day be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=22\\\\\n(b+c)/2=13 \\Rightarrow b+c&=26\\\\\nc+d&=30\\\\\na+c&=26\n\\end{align*} Notice that we do not have to solve for any of the variables. We can add $a + b = 22$ to $c + d = 30$ and find that $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52.$ Therefore, the entire trail was $\\boxed{52}$ miles long.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. We'll let the distance hiked on the first day be x, the distance hiked on the second day be y, the distance hiked on the third day be z, and the distance hiked on the fourth day be w.\n\nFrom the information given, we have the following equations:\n\n1. x + y = 22 (The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles)\n2. (y + z) / 2 = 13 (The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day)\n3. z + w = 30 (The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles)\n4. x + z = 26 (The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles)\n\nWe can simplify equation 2 by multiplying both sides by 2:\n\n2. y + z = 26\n\nNow, we have four equations:\n\n1. x + y = 22\n2. y + z = 26\n3. z + w = 30\n4. x + z = 26\n\nWe can solve equation 1 for y and substitute it into equation 2:\n\n1. y = 22 - x\n2. y + z = 26\n(22 - x) + z = 26\n\nSimplifying equation 2:\n\nz - x = 4\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\nz - x = 4\nx + z = 26\n\nWe can add these two equations together to eliminate z:\n\n2x + 2z = 30\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\nx + z = 15\n\nNow we have:\n\nx + z = 15\nx + z = 26\n\nSince both equations are equal to x + z, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n15 = 26\n\nHowever, this is a contradiction, which means that the system of equations is inconsistent, and there is no solution.\n\nBut this is not what we expected. Let's try another approach.\n\nWe can solve equation 2 for y and substitute it into equation 1:\n\n1. y = 26 - z\n2. x + y = 22\nx + (26 - z) = 22\n\nSimplifying equation 2:\n\nx - z = -4\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\nx - z = -4\nx + z = 26\n\nWe can add these two equations together to eliminate z:\n\n2x = 22\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\nx = 11\n\nNow we have x = 11, and we can substitute it back into one of the original equations:\n\nx + y = 22\n11 + y = 22\n\nSimplifying equation:\n\ny = 11\n\nNow that we have x = 11 and y = 11, we can substitute these values back into equation 4:\n\nx + z = 26\n11 + z = 26\n\nSimplifying equation:\n\nz = 15\n\nNow that we have z = 15, we can substitute it back into equation 3:\n\nz + w = 30\n15 + w = 30\n\nSimplifying equation:\n\nw = 15\n\nNow we have x = 11, y = 11, z = 15, and w = 15. We can use this information to find the total distance of the trail:\n\nTotal distance = x + y + z + w\nTotal distance = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15\nTotal distance = 52\n\nTherefore, the total distance of the trail is:\n\n$\\boxed{52}$"
