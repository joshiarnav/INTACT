    "problem": "A ball travels on a parabolic path in which the height (in feet) is given by the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$, where $t$ is the time after launch. What is the maximum height of the ball, in feet?",
    "solution": "To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \\[-16t^2+80t+21=-16(t^2-5t)+21\\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-5/2)^2=6.25$ inside the parenthesis to get \\begin{align*}\n-16(t^2-5t)+21&=-16(t^2-5t+6.25-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16([t-2.5]^2-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16(t-2.5)^2+121\n\\end{align*}Since $-16(t-2.5)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-2.5)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+121=\\boxed{121}$ feet.",

    "model_solution": "To find the maximum height of the ball, we need to find the vertex of the parabola given by the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$. The x-coordinate (in this case, time $t$) of the vertex of a parabola $ax^2+bx+c$ can be found using the formula $t=-\\frac{b}{2a}$.\n\nIn the given expression, $a=-16$ and $b=80$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$t=-\\frac{80}{2(-16)}$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$t=-\\frac{80}{-32}$\n\n$t=\\frac{80}{32}$\n\n$t=\\frac{5}{2}$\n\nSo, the time at which the ball reaches its maximum height is $\\frac{5}{2}$ seconds.\n\nNow, we need to find the y-coordinate (maximum height) at this time. We plug $\\frac{5}{2}$ into the original expression:\n\n$-16(\\frac{5}{2})^2+80(\\frac{5}{2})+21$\n\nExpanding the expression, we get:\n\n$-16(\\frac{25}{4})+200+21$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$-100+200+21$\n\n$=121$\n\nSo, the maximum height of the ball is $\\boxed{121}$ feet."
