    "problem": "If $27^8=9^q$, what is $q$?",
    "solution": "We begin by expressing both sides of the equation in terms of the base 2: $(3^3)^8=(3^2)^q$, which simplifies to $3^{24}=3^{2q}$. Setting the exponents equal to each other, $24=2q$, or $q=\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of q, we need to express both sides of the equation with the same base.\n\nWe can rewrite $27^8$ and $9^q$ with the base 3, since both 27 and 9 can be expressed as powers of 3:\n\n$27 = 3^3$ and $9 = 3^2$\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation:\n\n$(3^3)^8 = (3^2)^q$\n\nUsing the rule of exponents that $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$, we can simplify the equation:\n\n$3^{3 \\times 8} = 3^{2 \\times q}$\n\n$3^{24} = 3^{2q}$\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n\n$24 = 2q$\n\nTo find q, we can divide both sides by 2:\n\n$q = \\frac{24}{2}$\n\n$q = 12$\n\nSo, the value of q is $\\boxed{12}$."
