    "model_solution": "To find the sum, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \n\nSum = (n * (a1 + an)) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\n\nIn this case, the first term (a1) is 1, the last term (an) is 49, and we need to find the number of terms (n). \n\nSince we are counting from 1 to 49, we can find n by subtracting the first term from the last term and adding 1: \n\nn = 49 - 1 + 1\nn = 49\n\nNow that we have the values for n, a1, and an, we can plug them into the formula:\n\nSum = (49 * (1 + 49)) / 2\nSum = (49 * 50) / 2\nSum = 2450 / 2\nSum = 1225\n\nSo, the sum is $\\boxed{1225}$."
