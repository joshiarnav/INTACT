    "problem": "A triangular region is bounded by the two coordinate axes and the line given by the equation $2x + y = 6$. What is the area of the region, in square units?",
    "solution": "To start, use the equation to solve for the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the line.  Letting $x$ equal 0, the $y$-intercept is 6.  Letting $y$ equal 0, we find that $2x=6$ so the $x$-intercept is 3.  Using the intercepts, we can graph the line as shown: [asy]size(100,0);\nfill((0,0)--(0,6)--(3,0)--cycle,gray(.7));\nadd(grid(5,8));\ndraw((0,0)--(5,0),linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,8),linewidth(2));\nlabel(\"\",(5,0),E);\nlabel(\"\",(0,8),N);\ndraw((0,6)--(3,0),blue,Arrows);[/asy] We wish to find the area of the shaded region.  This is a right triangle with one base of length 3, and one of length 6.  Therefore, the area is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3\\cdot 6=\\boxed{9}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the region, we need to determine the vertices of the triangle. \n\nFirst, let's find the points where the line intersects the x-axis. When y = 0, the equation becomes:\n\n2x + 0 = 6\n2x = 6\nx = 3\n\nSo, the line intersects the x-axis at (3, 0).\n\nNext, let's find the points where the line intersects the y-axis. When x = 0, the equation becomes:\n\n2(0) + y = 6\ny = 6\n\nSo, the line intersects the y-axis at (0, 6).\n\nNow that we have the vertices of the triangle (0, 0), (3, 0), and (0, 6), we can find the area of the triangle. The base of the triangle is 3 units (the distance from (0, 0) to (3, 0)) and the height of the triangle is 6 units (the distance from (0, 0) to (0, 6)).\n\nThe area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = (base * height) / 2\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nArea = (3 * 6) / 2\nArea = 18 / 2\nArea = 9\n\nSo, the area of the region is 9 square units.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{9}$."
