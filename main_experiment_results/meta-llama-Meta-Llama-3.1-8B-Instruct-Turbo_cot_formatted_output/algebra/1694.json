    "problem": "A puppy and two cats together weigh 24 pounds. The puppy and the larger cat together weigh exactly twice as much as the smaller cat, and the puppy and the smaller cat together weigh exactly the same as the larger cat. How many pounds does the puppy weigh?",
    "solution": "Let the weight of the puppy be $a$, the weight of the smaller cat be $b$, and the weight of the larger cat be $c$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c&=24\\\\\na+c&=2b\\\\\na+b&=c\n\\end{align*} From Equation (2), we have $a=2b-c$. Substituting that into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b+c=24 \\Rightarrow b=8\n\\end{align*} Substituting $a=2b-c$ into Equation (3) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b&=c \\Rightarrow 3b=2c\n\\end{align*} Since $b=8$, $c=\\frac{3}{2}b=12$. Finally, substituting the values of $b$ and $c$ into Equation (1) to solve for $a$, we have $a+8+12=24$, or $a=4$. Thus, the puppy weighs $\\boxed{4}$ pounds.",

    "model_solution": "Let's denote the weight of the puppy as P, the weight of the larger cat as L, and the weight of the smaller cat as S.\n\nFrom the given information, we have the following equations:\n\n1. P + L + S = 24\n2. P + L = 2S\n3. P + S = L\n\nWe can start by substituting the third equation into the first equation:\n\n(P + S) + L + S = 24\nL + 2S = 24\n\nNow, we have:\nP + L = 2S\nL + 2S = 24\n\nWe can solve these two equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:\n(L + 2S) - (P + L) = 24 - 2S\n(L - P) + 2S = 24 - 2S\nL - P = 24 - 4S\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for L from the third equation into the above equation:\n(P + S) - P = 24 - 4S\nS = 24 - 4S\n\nNow, we can solve for S:\n5S = 24\nS = 24 / 5\nS = 4.8\n\nNow that we have the value of S, we can find the value of L using the third equation:\nL = P + S\nL = P + 4.8\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for L and S into the first equation:\nP + (P + 4.8) + 4.8 = 24\n2P + 9.6 = 24\n\nNow, we can solve for P:\n2P = 24 - 9.6\n2P = 14.4\nP = 7.2\n\nTherefore, the puppy weighs $\\boxed{7.2}$ pounds."
