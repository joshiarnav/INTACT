    "model_solution": "To find the value of $b$, we need to determine the midpoint of the line segment from $(2,5)$ to $(4,9)$. The midpoint is given by the formula: \n\nMidpoint = $\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)$\n\nwhere $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the endpoints of the line segment.\n\nIn this case, the endpoints are $(2,5)$ and $(4,9)$, so the midpoint is:\n\nMidpoint = $\\left(\\frac{2 + 4}{2}, \\frac{5 + 9}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{6}{2}, \\frac{14}{2}\\right) = (3,7)$\n\nSince the graph of the line $x+y=b$ intersects the line segment at its midpoint, the midpoint $(3,7)$ must lie on the line. Therefore, we can substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ into the equation of the line:\n\n$3 + 7 = b$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$b = 10$\n\nSo, the value of $b$ is $\\boxed{10}$."
