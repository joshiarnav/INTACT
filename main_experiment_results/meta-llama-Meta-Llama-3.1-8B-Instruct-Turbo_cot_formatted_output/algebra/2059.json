    "solution": "We can have $\\log_{10}10=1$ and $\\log_{10}100=2$.  Since $\\log_{10}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\\log_{10}10<\\log_{10}17<\\log_{10}100$, meaning $1<\\log_{10}17<2$.  Thus, the desired sum is $1+2=\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $a$ and $b$, we need to determine the consecutive integers between which $\\log_{10}{17}$ lies.\n\nWe know that $\\log_{10}{10} = 1$ and $\\log_{10}{100} = 2$. This means that any number between 10 and 100 will have a logarithm base 10 between 1 and 2.\n\nSince 17 lies between 10 and 100, $\\log_{10}{17}$ will lie between 1 and 2.\n\nSo, $a=1$ and $b=2$. \n\nTherefore, $a+b = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{3}$."
