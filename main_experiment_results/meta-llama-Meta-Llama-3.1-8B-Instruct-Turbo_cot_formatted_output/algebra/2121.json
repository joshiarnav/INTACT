    "problem": "Four primes $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ form an increasing arithmetic sequence with $a > 5$ and common difference 6. What is the ones digit of $a$?",
    "solution": "Every prime number greater than 5 has a ones digit of 1, 3, 7, or 9.  For each of these digits, let's add 6, take the resulting ones digit, and repeat the process two more times. We get the following sequences of digits. \\begin{align*}\n1, 7, 3, 9 \\\\\n3, 9, 5, 1 \\\\\n7, 3, 9, 5 \\\\\n9, 5, 1, 7\n\\end{align*} Only the first of these sequences could be the sequence of ones digits of four prime numbers, since each of the other three sequences contains 5.  Therefore, the units digit of $a$ is $\\boxed{1}$. The example $a=11$ shows that there exists such a sequence of consecutive prime numbers.",

    "model_solution": "To find the ones digit of $a$, let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\nSince $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ form an increasing arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6, we can write:\n\n$a$, $a+6$, $a+12$, $a+18$\n\nGiven that $a > 5$ and all four numbers are primes, we need to find a sequence of four prime numbers with a common difference of 6.\n\nThe first few prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, etc.\n\nSince $a > 5$, we start from 7, which is the smallest prime number greater than 5.\n\nNow, let's try to find a sequence of four prime numbers with a common difference of 6:\n\nStarting from 7, adding 6 gives 13, which is a prime number. Then, adding 6 to 13 gives 19, which is also a prime number. Continuing, adding 6 to 19 gives 25, but 25 is not a prime number (it's a square of 5). So, we need to try another starting number.\n\nLet's try 11, which is the next prime number greater than 7. Adding 6 to 11 gives 17, which is a prime number. Then, adding 6 to 17 gives 23, which is also a prime number. Continuing, adding 6 to 23 gives 29, which is a prime number.\n\nWe have found a sequence of four prime numbers with a common difference of 6: 11, 17, 23, 29.\n\nLooking at this sequence, we can see that the ones digit of $a$ is 1.\n\nTherefore, the ones digit of $a$ is $\\boxed{1}$."
