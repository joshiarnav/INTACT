    "problem": "Find $A$ and $B$ such that\n\\[\\frac{5x+2}{x^2-7x-30}=\\frac{A}{x-10}+\\frac{B}{x+3}.\\]Write your answer in the form $(A,B)$.",
    "solution": "We factor the denominator in the left-hand side to get \\[\\frac{5x+2}{(x-10)(x+3)}= \\frac{A}{x - 10} + \\frac{B}{x + 3}.\\]We then multiply both sides by $(x - 10)(x + 3)$, to get \\[5x + 2 = A(x + 3) + B(x - 10).\\]We can solve for $A$ and $B$ by substituting suitable values of $x$.  For example, setting $x = 10$, the equation becomes $52 = 13A$, so $A = 4$.  Setting $x = -3$, the equation becomes $-13 = -13B$, so $B = 1$.  Therefore, $(A,B) = \\boxed{(4,1)}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve for $A$ and $B$, we can use the method of partial fraction decomposition. \n\nFirst, we want to express the given equation in terms of two separate fractions. Since the denominator on the left side has the form $(x-10)(x+3)$, we can split it into two fractions, each with one of the factors in the denominator.\n\nThe given equation is:\n\n\\[\\frac{5x+2}{x^2-7x-30}=\\frac{A}{x-10}+\\frac{B}{x+3}.\\]\n\nWe can rewrite the denominator of the left side as $(x-10)(x+3)$, and then multiply both sides by this expression to get rid of the fractions:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{5x+2}{(x-10)(x+3)}&=\\frac{A}{x-10}+\\frac{B}{x+3}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 5x+2 &= A(x+3) + B(x-10)\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow we can expand the right side and equate the coefficients of the $x$ terms and the constant terms on both sides:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n5x+2 &= A(x+3) + B(x-10)\\\\\n&= Ax + 3A + Bx - 10B\\\\\n&= (A+B)x + (3A - 10B)\n\\end{align*}\n\nEquating the coefficients of the $x$ terms, we get:\n\n\\[A+B=5\\]\n\nEquating the constant terms, we get:\n\n\\[3A - 10B = 2\\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations in two variables:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA+B&=5\\\\\n3A-10B&=2\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can solve this system by multiplying the first equation by $3$ and adding it to the second equation to eliminate $B$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n3(A+B)&=3(5)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 3A+3B&=15\n\\end{align*}\n\nAdding this to the second equation, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(3A+3B) + (3A-10B)&=15+2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6A-7B&=17\n\\end{align*}\n\nHowever, we can use a simpler method to find A and B.\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 3 and subtracting it from the second, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\n3A-10B&=2\\\\\n-3A-3B&=-15\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSubtracting gives $-13B = -13$. Solving for B gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\nB&=\\frac{-13}{-13}\\\\\nB&=1\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nPlugging this into the first equation gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\nA+1&=5\\\\\nA&=5-1\\\\\nA&=4\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, $(A, B) = (4, 1)$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{(4,1)}$."
