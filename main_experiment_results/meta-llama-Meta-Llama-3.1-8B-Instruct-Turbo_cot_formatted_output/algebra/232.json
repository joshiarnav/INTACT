    "problem": "A 1$\\%$ late charge was added to Jenna's bill on the $30^{\\text{th}}$ day past its due date. The resulting total was then increased by 1$\\%$ because she did not pay the bill in the next 30 days either. Her original bill was $\\$400$. Exactly how much is the bill now?",
    "solution": "The first late charge brings the bill to $400 \\cdot 1.01 = 400 + 4 = 404$. The second late charge brings the bill to $404 \\cdot 1.01 = 404 + 4.04 = \\boxed{408.04}$ dollars.\n\n-OR-\n\nEach increase multiples the bill by $1+1\\%=1.01$. Therefore, her final bill is $\\$400(1.01)^2=\\$408.04$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the final amount of Jenna's bill, we need to apply the 1% late charge twice.\n\n1. First late charge: \nThe original bill is $\\$400$. A 1% late charge is added to this amount. \n\nTo find 1% of $\\$400$, we multiply $\\$400$ by 0.01: \n\n$\\$400 \\cdot 0.01 = \\$4$\n\nThis $\\$4$ is added to the original bill: \n\n$\\$400 + \\$4 = \\$404$\n\nSo, after the first 30 days, Jenna's bill is $\\$404$.\n\n2. Second late charge: \nAnother 1% late charge is added to the $\\$404$ bill.\n\nTo find 1% of $\\$404$, we multiply $\\$404$ by 0.01:\n\n$\\$404 \\cdot 0.01 = \\$4.04$\n\nThis $\\$4.04$ is added to the $\\$404$ bill:\n\n$\\$404 + \\$4.04 = \\$408.04$\n\nSo, after the second 30 days, Jenna's bill is $\\$408.04$.\n\nTherefore, the final amount of Jenna's bill is $\\boxed{\\$408.04}$."
