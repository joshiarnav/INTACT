    "problem": "What is the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double?",
    "solution": "From the information given, we have $x^2 = 2x + 48$. Rearranging, we get $x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$, which we can factor as $(x+6)(x-8) = 0$. Therefore, $x = -6\\text{ or }8$.  Since we want the lesser, $\\boxed{-6}$ is our answer.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double, let's call the integer 'x'.\n\nThe square of 'x' is $x^2$, and its double is $2x$.\n\nWe are given that the square is 48 more than the double, so we can write the equation:\n\n$x^2 = 2x + 48$\n\nNow, let's rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\n$x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula or factorization. \n\nLet's try factorization:\n\nThe equation can be factored as:\n\n$(x - 8)(x + 6) = 0$\n\nNow, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for 'x':\n\n$x - 8 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 8$\n\n$x + 6 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -6$\n\nThe least integer 'x' whose square is 48 more than its double is $-6$, since $-6$ is smaller than $8$.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{-6}$"
