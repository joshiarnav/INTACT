    "problem": "I have a picture with dimensions $x$ and $y$ (in inches), such that $x$ and $y$ are both integers greater than one. I would like to place this picture in an elongated frame of dimensions $(2x + 3)$ and  $(y+2)$. If I measured the area of the frame to be $34$ square inches, what is the area of the picture in square inches? (Note that by \"the area of the frame,\" we mean the shaded region shown below).  [asy]\nsize(5cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\nreal eps=0.2;\nfilldraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,1)--(0,1)--cycle,gray);\nfilldraw((0,0)+(eps,eps)--(2,0)+(-eps,eps)--(2,1)+(-eps,-eps)--(0,1)+(eps,-eps)--cycle,white);\nlabel(\"picture\",(1,0.5));\nlabel(\"frame\",(1,1-eps/2));\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "The area of the frame is equal to  \\begin{align*}\n(2x + 3) \\cdot (y+2) - x \\cdot y &= 2xy + 4x + 3y + 6 - xy \\\\\n&= xy + 4x + 3y + 6 \\\\\n&= 34.\n\\end{align*}To apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we add $6$ to both sides of the equation: $$xy + 4x + 3y + 12 = 40,$$so $$(x + 3)(y+4) = 40.$$Considering the factor pairs of 40, we see that the ordered pair $(x+3, y+4)$ must be among $$(1,40),(2,20),(4,10),(5,8),(8,5),(10,4),(20,2),(40,1).$$Solving for $x$ and $y$ for each pair of factors, we find that $(x,y)$ must be among the pairs $$(-2,36), (-1,16), (1,6), (2,4), (5,1), (7,0), (17,-2), (37,-3).$$Of these, only $(x,y) = (2,4)$ satisfy the condition that both $x$ and $y$ are greater than $1$. The area of the picture is thus $x \\times y = \\boxed{8}$ square inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the picture, we first need to find the values of $x$ and $y$. \n\nThe area of the frame is given by the formula: \n\nArea of frame = (Area of whole picture including the frame) - (Area of the picture).\n\nWe know that the dimensions of the whole picture including the frame are $(2x + 3)$ and  $(y+2)$. Therefore, the area of the whole picture including the frame is $(2x + 3)(y+2)$. \n\nThe area of the picture is given by the dimensions of the picture, which are $x$ and $y$. Therefore, the area of the picture is $xy$.\n\nGiven that the area of the frame is $34$ square inches, we can write the equation: \n\n$(2x + 3)(y+2) - xy = 34$\n\nExpanding and simplifying the above equation, we get:\n\n$2xy + 4x + 3y + 6 - xy = 34$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$xy + 4x + 3y + 6 = 34$\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides of the equation:\n\n$xy + 4x + 3y = 28$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the above equation. \n\nNotice that the equation is a quadratic in terms of $x$ and $y$. However, since $x$ and $y$ are integers greater than one, we can try factoring the left-hand side of he equation.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$xy + 4x + 3y + 12 = 40$\n\n$(x + 3)(y + 4) = 40$\n\nLooking at the factors of $40$, we can write the following possibilities:\n\n- $(x+3, y+4)$ = $(1, 40)$ (not possible since $x$ and $y$ are integers greater than one)\n- $(x+3, y+4)$ = $(2, 20)$ (not possible since $x$ and $y$ are integers greater than one)\n- $(x+3, y+4)$ = $(4, 10)$ \n- $(x+3, y+4)$ = $(5, 8)$ \n\nFrom the above possibilities, we can see that $(x+3, y+4)$ = $(5, 8)$ is the only possibility.\n\nSolving for $x$ and $y$, we get:\n\n- $x + 3 = 5$\n- $x = 2$\n\n- $y + 4 = 8$\n- $y = 4$\n\nTherefore, the values of $x$ and $y$ are $2$ and $4$, respectively.\n\nThe area of the picture is given by $xy$, which is equal to $(2)(4) = 8$ square inches.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{8}$."
