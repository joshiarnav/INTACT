    "problem": "Joann rode her bike at an average speed of 12 miles per hour for three and a half hours. If her friend, Fran, rides for 3 hours, at what average speed, in miles per hour, would she have to ride her bike to travel the same distance that Joann traveled?",
    "solution": "In $3\\frac{1}{2}$ hours, Joann covers $\\left(3\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ hours}\\right)(12\\text{ mph})=42$ miles.  If Fran's average speed in miles per hour is $s$, then Fran covers $3s$ miles in $3$ hours.  Solving $3s=42$ we find $s=\\boxed{14}$ miles per hour.",

    "model_solution": "To find the distance Joann traveled, we can multiply her average speed by the time she rode her bike:\n\nDistance = average speed * time\nDistance = 12 miles/hour * 3.5 hours\nDistance = 42 miles\n\nNow, we need to find Fran's average speed so that she can travel the same distance (42 miles) in 3 hours. We can use the formula:\n\nAverage speed = distance / time\n\nSubstituting the values for Fran, we get:\n\nAverage speed = 42 miles / 3 hours\nAverage speed = 14 miles per hour\n\nSo, Fran would have to ride her bike at an average speed of 14 miles per hour to travel the same distance as Joann.\n\n$\\boxed{14}$"
