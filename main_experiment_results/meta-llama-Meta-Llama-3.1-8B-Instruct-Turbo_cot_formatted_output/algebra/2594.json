    "problem": "The third and fourth terms of a geometric sequence are 12 and 16, respectively. What is the first term of the sequence?",
    "solution": "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence. Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$. Solving, we have $a\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the first term of the geometric sequence, we need to use the given information about the third and fourth terms.\n\nLet's denote the first term of the sequence as 'a' and the common ratio as 'r'. \n\nThe nth term of a geometric sequence is given by: \nan = a * r^(n-1)\n\nWe know the third term (n=3) is 12 and the fourth term (n=4) is 16. \n\nSo we can set up the equations:\n\na * r^(3-1) = 12\na * r^2 = 12\n\na * r^(4-1) = 16\na * r^3 = 16\n\nNow we can divide the second equation by the first equation:\n\n(a * r^3) / (a * r^2) = 16 / 12\nr = 16 / 12\nr = 4/3\n\nNow that we know the common ratio 'r' is 4/3, we can substitute this back into one of the original equations to find the first term 'a'. We'll use the first equation:\na * (4/3)^2 = 12\n\nNow we can solve for 'a':\na * (16/9) = 12\na = 12 * (9/16)\na = 27/4\n\nTherefore, the first term of the sequence is $\\boxed{27/4}$."
