    "problem": "The letters of the alphabet are each assigned a random integer value, and $H=10$. The value of a word comes from the sum of its letters' values. If $MATH$ is 35 points, $TEAM$ is 42 points and $MEET$ is 38 points, what is the value of $A$?",
    "solution": "$MATH$ is 35 points, and $H$ is 10 points, so $MAT$ is 25 points. $TEAM = E + MAT$, so $E = 42 - 25 = 17$ points. $MEET$ is 38 points, and $E$ is 17 points, so $MT = 38 - 2 \\cdot 17 = 4$ points. Finally, because $TEAM = E + MT + A$, we can solve for $A$: $17 + 4 + A = 42$, so $A= 42 - 17 - 4 = \\boxed{21}$ points.",

    "model_solution": "Let's denote the value of the letter 'A' as $A$, the value of the letter 'T' as $T$, the value of the letter 'E' as $E$, and the value of the letter 'M' as $M$. \n\nWe are given that $H=10$ and we also know the value of the word $MATH$ ($M+A+T+H$), which is 35 points. \n\nSo we can write: $MATH = M + A + T + H = 35$\n\nSince we are given that $H = 10$, we can substitute $H$ with 10 in the above equation:\n\n$M + A + T + 10 = 35$\n\nNow we'll subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to isolate the sum of $M$, $A$, and $T$:\n\n$M + A + T = 25$  (equation 1)\n\nNow we'll use the word $TEAM$ to create another equation. The value of the word $TEAM$ ($T+E+A+M$) is 42 points. \n\nSo we can write: $TEAM = T + E + A + M = 42$\n\nSince the equation 1 states that $M + A + T = 25$, we can substitute $M + A + T$ with 25 in the above equation:\n\n$25 + E = 42$\n\nNow we'll subtract 25 from both sides of the equation to isolate the value of the letter $E$:\n\n$E = 42 - 25$\n\n$E = 17$\n\nNow we'll use the word $MEET$ to create another equation. The value of the word $MEET$ ($M+E+E+T$) is 38 points. \n\nSo we can write: $MEET = M + E + E + T = 38$\n\nSince we are given that $E = 17$ and we know that the equation 1 states that $M + A + T = 25$, we can substitute $M + A + T$ with 25 and $E$ with 17 in the above equation:\n\n$M + 17 + 17 + T = 38$\n\nNow we'll simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\n$M + T + 34 = 38$\n\nNow we'll subtract 34 from both sides of the equation to isolate the sum of $M$ and $T$:\n\n$M + T = 4$\n\nNow we'll use the equation 1 ($M + A + T = 25$) and the fact that $M + T = 4$ ($M + T = 4$) to solve for the value of the letter $A$. We'll substitute $M + T$ with 4 in the equation 1:\n\n$4 + A = 25$\n\nNow we'll subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to isolate the value of the letter $A$:\n\n$A = 25 - 4$\n\n$A = 21$\n\nSo, the value of the letter 'A' is 21.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{21}$."
