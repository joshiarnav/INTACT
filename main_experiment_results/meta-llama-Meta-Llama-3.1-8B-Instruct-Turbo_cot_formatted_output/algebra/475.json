    "problem": "What is the greatest integer $x$ such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime?",
    "solution": "We can factor the quadratic $6x^2-47x+15$ as $(2x-15)(3x-1)$. So we have $|6x^2-47x+15|=|(2x-15)(3x-1)|=|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|$. In order for $|6x^2-47x+15|$ to be prime, its only divisors must be $1$ and itself. Thus one of $|2x-15|$ or $|3x-1|$ must be equal to $1$.\n\nIf $|3x-1|=1$, then $3x-1=1$ or $3x-1=-1$. These equations yield $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $x=0$, respectively. We throw out $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ since it is not an integer, and keep $x=0$ as a candidate.\n\nIf $|2x-15|=1$, then $2x-15=1$, in which case $2x=16$ and $x=8$, or $2x-15=-1$, in which case $2x=14$ and $x=7$.\n\nThus our candidates for the greatest $x$ are $0, 7$, and $8$. It remains to check whether the other factor is prime. We first check $x=8$. Since $|2x-15|=1$, we know $|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|=|3x-1|=|24-1|=23$, which is prime. Thus $\\boxed{8}$ is the largest integer for which $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime.",

    "model_solution": "To find the greatest integer $x$ such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime, we need to factorize the given quadratic expression.\n\nStep 1: Factorize the given quadratic expression $6x^2-47x+15$.\n\nWe can factorize this expression as follows:\n\\[6x^2-47x+15 = (2x-15)(3x-1)\\]\n\nStep 2: Rewrite the expression using the factorized form.\n\nWe can rewrite $|6x^2-47x+15|$ as $|(2x-15)(3x-1)|$.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible cases for $|(2x-15)(3x-1)|$ to be prime.\n\n- If $|(2x-15)(3x-1)|$ is prime, then either $|2x-15|$ or $|3x-1|$ must be equal to $1$, because the product of two integers is prime if and only if one of the integers is $1$ and the other integer is a prime number.\n\nStep 4: Set up equations based on the cases from Step 3.\n\nWe get the following equations:\n- Case 1: $|2x-15| = 1$ and $|3x-1| \\neq 1$\n- Case 2: $|3x-1| = 1$ and $|2x-15| \\neq 1$\n\nStep 5: Solve the equations for both cases.\n\nFor Case 1:\n$|2x-15| = 1$ implies that $2x-15 = 1$ or $2x-15 = -1$, giving us $x = 8$ or $x = 7$.\nHowever, $|3x-1| \\neq 1$ for both values of $x$.\n\nFor Case 2:\n$|3x-1| = 1$ implies that $3x-1 = 1$ or $3x-1 = -1$, giving us $x = \\frac{2}{3}$ or $x = 0$.\nHowever, $|2x-15| \\neq 1$ for $x = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the solution for this case is $x = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nStep 6: Check for any other solutions.\n\nSince $x = 8$ and $x = 7$ don't satisfy the conditions in Case 1, we consider the other possible solutions.\n\nWe need to check if there are any integer solutions for $x$ such that $x$ satisfies the conditions of both $|2x-15|$ and $|3x-1|$ being equal to $1$.\n\nStep 7: We found that $x = 8$ does satisfy the original equations when the equation for $|3x-1|$ is $1$ on one side and we found a solution where $x = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nNow we have to ensure $\\boxed{8}$ is the greatest integer.\n\nTherefore, the greatest integer $x$ such that $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime is $\\boxed{8}$."
