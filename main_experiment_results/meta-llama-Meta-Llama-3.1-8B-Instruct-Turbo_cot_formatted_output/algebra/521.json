    "solution": "Simplifying, we have  $18(x+y)=xy$, so $xy - 18x - 18y = 0$ Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick by adding 324 to both sides, we get $xy-18x-18y +324=324$, so \\[(x-18)(y-18)=324.\\]Now we seek the minimal $x+y,$ which occurs when $x-18$ and $y-18$ are as close to each other in value as possible. The two best candidates are $(x-18,y-18)=(12,27)$ or $(9,36),$ of which $(x,y)=(30,45)$ attains the minimum sum of $\\boxed{75}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest possible value for $x + y$, we can start by simplifying the given equation:\n\n$\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{18}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $18xy$ to eliminate the fractions:\n\n$18y + 18x = xy$\n\nRearranging the terms to get a quadratic equation in terms of $x$ and $y$:\n\n$xy - 18x - 18y = 0$\n\nNow, let's add $18^2$ to both sides of the equation:\n\n$xy - 18x - 18y + 18^2 = 18^2$\n\nThis can be factored using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick:\n\n$(x - 18)(y - 18) = 18^2$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n$\\sqrt{(x - 18)(y - 18)} = \\sqrt{18^2}$\n\n$(x - 18)(y - 18) = 324$\n\nTo find the smallest possible value for $x + y$, we need to find two factors of $324$ that are as close as possible to each other. The factors of $324$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 27, 36, 54, 81, 108, 162,$ and $324$.\n\nThe two factors that are closest to each other are $18$ and $18$. However, since the problem statement says that $x \\neq y$, we need to choose the next closest pair of factors. \n\nThe next closest pair of factors is $12$ and $27$. Therefore, we can set $x - 18 = 12$ and $y - 18 = 27$.\n\nSolving for $x$ and $y$:\n\n$x = 12 + 18 = 30$\n$y = 27 + 18 = 45$\n\nNow, we can find the smallest possible value for $x + y$:\n\n$x + y = 30 + 45 = 75$\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value for $x + y$ is $\\boxed{75}$."
