    "problem": "What is the sum of all values of $k$ such that the equation $2x^2-kx+8=0$ has two distinct integer solutions?",
    "solution": "We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively. Let the two roots of the equation be $p$ and $q$. Then $p+q=k/2$. However the only other restriction on $p$ and $q$ is that $pq = 4$ and that $p$ and $q$ are distinct integers. For each such possibility $(p,q)$, we also have the possibility $(-p,-q)$ since $(-p)(-q) = pq = 4$. This gives two values of $k$: $k=2(p+q)$ and $k=2(-p-q)$. Since these occur in such pairs, the sum of all possible values of $k$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nAlternatively, one can note that the only way to factor 4 into 2 distinct integer factors is $4\\cdot1$ and $(-4)(-1)$, so that the two possible values of $k$ are $10$ and $-10$, given a sum of $0$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the sum of all values of $k$ such that the equation $2x^2-kx+8=0$ has two distinct integer solutions, we can use Vieta's formulas, which states that for a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$.\n\nIn this case, the sum of the roots is $k/2$, and the product of the roots is $8/2 = 4$. \n\nSince the roots are distinct integers, there are only a few possibilities for the roots: $(1, 4)$, $(-1, -4)$, $(2, 2)$, $(-2, -2)$, $(4, 1)$, or $(-4, -1)$. However, since the roots are not distinct in the cases $(2, 2)$ and $(-2, -2)$, we can disregard these. \n\nFor the case $(1, 4)$, the sum of the roots is $5$, and for the case $(-1, -4)$, the sum of the roots is $-5$, so $k/2=5$ or $k/2=-5$. For the case $(4, 1)$, the sum of the roots is also $5$, and for the case $(-4, -1)$, the sum of the roots is also $-5$, so $k/2=5$ or $k/2=-5$. Thus, the possible values of $k$ are $10$, $-10$, $10$, and $-10$.\n\nThe sum of all values of $k$ such that the equation $2x^2-kx+8=0$ has two distinct integer solutions is $\\boxed{0}$"
