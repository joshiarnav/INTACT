    "problem": "The vertex of the parabola described by the equation $y=-3x^2-30x-81$ is $(m,n)$. What is $n$?",
    "solution": "We will complete the square on the given quadratic expression to find the vertex. Factoring $-3$ from the first two terms, we have \\[y=-3(x^2+10x)-81\\]In order to make the expression inside the parentheses a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(10/2)^2=25$ inside the parentheses. Doing this, we get \\[y=-3(x^2+10x+25-25)-81 = -3(x+5)^2-6\\]The graph of an equation of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ is a parabola with vertex at $(h,k)$, so the vertex of our parabola is at $(-5,-6)$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{-6}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the vertex of the parabola described by the equation $y=-3x^2-30x-81$, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex: \n\n$x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$\n\nIn the given equation, $a = -3$ and $b = -30$. \n\nWe substitute these values into the formula to find the x-coordinate of the vertex:\n\n$x = -\\frac{-30}{2(-3)}$\n$x = -\\frac{-30}{-6}$\n$x = -5$\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the y-coordinate by substituting this value into the original equation:\n\n$y = -3(-5)^2 - 30(-5) - 81$\n$y = -3(25) + 150 - 81$\n$y = -75 + 150 - 81$\n$y = -6$\n\nTherefore, the y-coordinate of the vertex is $n=-6$. \n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{-6}$."
