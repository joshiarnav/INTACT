    "problem": "If a rectangular prism has a length of $l$, a width of $w$, and a height of $h$, then the length of its diagonal is equal to $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}$. Suppose $l = 3$ and $h = 12$; if the length of the diagonal is $13$, what is the width?",
    "solution": "We are given that $$\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + w^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{153 + w^2} = 13.$$Squaring both sides, it follows that $$153 + w^2 = 13^2 = 169 \\quad\\Longrightarrow \\quad w = \\pm 4.$$Since the width must be a positive quantity, the answer is $\\boxed{4}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the width, we need to use the given formula for the length of the diagonal: $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}$.\n\nWe are given the length of the diagonal as 13, the length $l$ as 3, and the height $h$ as 12. We can plug these values into the formula:\n\n$\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = 13$\n\nNow, substitute the given values:\n\n$\\sqrt{3^2 + w^2 + 12^2} = 13$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$\\sqrt{9 + w^2 + 144} = 13$\n\nCombine the constants:\n\n$\\sqrt{w^2 + 153} = 13$\n\nSquare both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:\n\n$w^2 + 153 = 169$\n\nSubtract 153 from both sides:\n\n$w^2 = 16$\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\n$w = \\pm \\sqrt{16}$\n\nSince the width cannot be negative, we only take the positive value:\n\n$w = \\sqrt{16}$\n\n$w = 4$\n\nSo, the width is 4. The answer is $\\boxed{4}$."
