    "solution": "Note that $f(x)$ is defined if and only if $x\\ge 3$.\n\nThus $f(f(x)) = f(\\sqrt{x-3})$ is defined if and only if $$\\sqrt{x-3}\\ge 3.$$ This is true if and only if $$x-3\\ge 3^2,$$ or equivalently, if $x\\ge 12$. So the smallest real number for which $f(f(x))$ is defined is $\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest real number $x$ in the domain of $f(f(x))$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. First, let's find the expression for $f(f(x))$ by substituting $f(x)$ into the function $f(x)$. \n\n   We have $f(x) = \\sqrt{x-3}$, so we substitute $f(x)$ into $f(x)$:\n   $f(f(x)) = \\sqrt{f(x) - 3}$\n   Now substitute $f(x)$ into the equation:\n   $f(f(x)) = \\sqrt{\\sqrt{x-3} - 3}$\n\n2. Now, we need to find the domain of $f(f(x))$. For $f(f(x))$ to be defined, the expression inside the square root must be non-negative. So, we need to solve the inequality:\n   $\\sqrt{x-3} - 3 \\geq 0$\n\n3. First, we add $3$ to both sides of the inequality to isolate the square root:\n   $\\sqrt{x-3} \\geq 3$\n\n4. To eliminate the square root, we square both sides of the inequality:\n   $(\\sqrt{x-3})^2 \\geq 3^2$\n\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n   $x - 3 \\geq 9$\n\n6. Add $3$ to both sides of the inequality to solve for $x$:\n   $x \\geq 12$\n\n7. Therefore, the smallest real number $x$ in the domain of $f(f(x))$ is $12$.\n\nSo, the answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
