    "solution": "The number of squares in the rectangles is an arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference 1. Thus, at Stage 6, there will be 6 squares. Since each square has an area of $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ square inches, the total area of the rectangle at Stage 6 is $6 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{54}$ square inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the rectangle at Stage 6, we need to understand how the rectangle grows at each stage.\n\nAt Stage 1, we have a single 3'' by 3'' square. The area of this square is $3 \\times 3 = 9$ square inches.\n\nAt Stage 2, we add a second 3'' by 3'' square to the right of the first 3'' by 3'' square. This creates a rectangle with a width of 6 meters and a height of 3 inches. The area of this rectangle is $6 \\times 3 = 18$ square inches.\n\nAt Stage 3, we add a third 3'' by 3'' square to the right of the second 3'' by 3'' square. This creates a rectangle with a width of 9 inches and a height of 3 inches. The area of this rectangle is $9 \\times 3 = 27$ square inches.\n\nNotice that at each stage, the width increases by 3 inches, and the height remains the same at 3 inches.\n\nAt Stage 6, we will have added 5 3'' by 3'' squares to the right of the first 3'' by 3'' square. The area of the rectangle at Stage 6 will be the width multiplied by the height. Since the width at Stage 6 will be $3 + 3 \\times 5 = 18$ inches, and the height remains at 3 inches, the area will be $18 \\times 3 = 54$ square inches.\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle at Stage 6 is $\\boxed{54}$ square inches."
