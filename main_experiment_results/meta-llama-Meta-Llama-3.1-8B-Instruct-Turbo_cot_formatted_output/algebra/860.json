    "problem": "The equation $x^2+ ax = -14$ has only integer solutions for $x$. If $a$ is a positive integer, what is the greatest possible value of $a$?",
    "solution": "The left-hand side factors into $x(x+a)=-14$, so $x$ and $x+a$ both divide $-14$. One of the two factors is negative and the other positive, since their product is negative. $x+a>x$, so $x+a>0$ and $x<0$. This leaves 4 possibilities for $x$, since it is negative and divides $-14$ evenly: $-1$, $-2$, $-7$, and $-14$. $x=-1$ gives $x+a=14$ and therefore $a=15$. Similarly, $x=-2$, $x=-7$, and $x=-14$ give $a=9$, $a=9$, and $a=15$, respectively. The largest value for $a$ is thus $\\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the greatest possible value of 'a', we can start by factoring the equation. \n\nGiven equation: $x^2 + ax = -14$\n\nRearranging the equation: $x^2 + ax + 14 = 0$\n\nNotice that if we factor the quadratic, we get two binomials of the form $(x + p)(x + q)$ where $p$ and $q$ are factors of $14$.\n\nSince the product of $p$ and $q$ must be $14$, we consider the following pairs of factors: $(1, 14)$, $(2, 7)$, $(-1, -14)$, and $(-2, -7)$.\n\nTo find the greatest possible value of $a$, we try each pair in the factored form $(x + p)(x + q)$.\n\nFor $(x + 1)(x + 14) = 0$, we get $x = -1$ or $x = -14$.\n\nFor $(x + 2)(x + 7) = 0$, we get $x = -2$ or $x = -7$.\n\nFor $(-x - 1)(-x - 14) = 0$, we get $x = 1$ or $x = 14$.\n\nFor $(-x - 2)(-x - 7) = 0$, we get $x = 2$ or $x = 7$.\n\nFrom the given equation, $x^2 + ax = -14$ has only integer solutions for $x$.
