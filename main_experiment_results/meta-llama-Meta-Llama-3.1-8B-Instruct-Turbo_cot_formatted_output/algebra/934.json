    "problem": "The graph of a certain quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertex $(-4,0)$ which passes through the point $(1,-75)$.  What is the value of $a$?",
    "solution": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic must be of the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$.  The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, which gives us the equation $-75 = 25a$.  Hence, $a = -75/25 = \\boxed{-3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve for the value of $a$, we can use the information given about the vertex and the point the parabola passes through.\n\nStep 1: The vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$. This means that the equation of the parabola can be written in the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$ since the vertex form of a parabola is $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$ where $(h,k)$ is the vertex.\n\nStep 2: The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$. We can substitute this point into the equation from Step 1 to solve for $a$. \n\nSubstituting $(1,-75)$ into the equation:\n$-75 = a(1 + 4)^2$\n\nStep 3: Now we solve for $a$.\n\nExpanding the equation:\n$-75 = a(5)^2$\n$-75 = a(25)$\n\nDividing both sides by 25:\n$a = \\frac{-75}{25}$\n\nSimplifying:\n$a = -3$\n\nSo, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{-3}$."
