    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the first six terms in a geometric sequence, we need to identify the first term (a) and the common ratio (r).\n\nIn the given sequence $\\frac12, \\frac14, \\frac18, \\dots$, the first term is $\\frac12$. To find the common ratio, we can divide any term by its previous term. \n\nFor example, $\\frac14 \\div \\frac12 = \\frac12$, or $\\frac18 \\div \\frac14 = \\frac12$. So, the common ratio is $\\frac12$.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence:\n\nS = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nwhere S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nIn this case, a = $\\frac12$, r = $\\frac12$, and n = 6.\n\nPlugging in these values, we get:\n\nS = $\\frac12$ * (1 - ($\\frac12)^6$) / (1 - $\\frac12$)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nS = $\\frac12$ * (1 - $\\frac{1}{64}$) / $\\frac12$\n\nS = (1 - $\\frac{1}{64}$) / 1\n\nS = (1 - $\\frac{1}{64}$)\n\nS = $\\frac{63}{64}$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the first six terms in the geometric sequence $\\frac12, \\frac14, \\frac18, \\dots$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{63}{64}}$."
