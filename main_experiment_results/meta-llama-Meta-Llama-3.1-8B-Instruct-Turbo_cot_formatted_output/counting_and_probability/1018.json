    "model_solution": "To find the probability of getting exactly 8 heads in 10 flips, we need to consider the number of ways this can happen and the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to get exactly 8 heads**\n\nWe can use the concept of combinations to find the number of ways to choose 8 heads out of 10 flips. The formula for combinations is:\n\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (total number of flips), and r = 8 (number of heads).\n\nSo, the number of ways to get exactly 8 heads is:\n\n10C8 = 10! / (8! * (10-8)!)\n= 10! / (8! * 2!)\n= (10 * 9) / 2\n= 45\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes**\n\nSince each flip has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails), the total number of possible outcomes for 10 flips is:\n\n2^10 = 1024\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probability**\n\nThe probability of getting exactly 8 heads is the number of ways to get 8 heads divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = Number of ways to get 8 heads / Total number of possible outcomes\n= 45 / 1024\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\n$\\boxed{45/1024}$"
