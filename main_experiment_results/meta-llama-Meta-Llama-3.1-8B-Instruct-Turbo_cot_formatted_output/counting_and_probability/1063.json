    "model_solution": "To find the number of distinct sequences of four letters that can be made from the letters in EQUALS, with each sequence beginning with L, ending with Q, and no letter appearing more than once, we can break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. **First letter**: The sequence must begin with L. There is only 1 choice for the first letter.\n\n2. **Second letter**: The second letter cannot be L or Q (since we cannot repeat letters), leaving us with the letters E, A, U, and S. There are 4 choices for the second letter.\n\n3. **Third letter**: The third letter cannot be L, Q, or the second letter we chose (since we cannot repeat letters). Depending on the second letter we chose, there will be 3 choices for the third letter. For example, if we chose E as the second letter, there would be 3 choices (A, U, S). \n\nHowever, to find the total number of distinct sequences, we should consider the total number of choices available when we are not restricted by the sequence. When we are not restricted, there are 5 choices for the second letter (4 letters excluding L and Q), and there are 3 choices for the third letter (3 letters excluding L, Q, and the letter chosen for the second position). Thus, the number of distinct sequences is calculated as follows:\n\nWe have 1 choice for the first letter (L), 4 choices for the second letter, and 3 choices for the third letter. However, we have not yet determined the fourth letter, which must be Q. \n\nThe total number of sequences is not calculated by multiplying these choices directly because we are only allowed to choose from the remaining 3 letters for the third position. To consider this restriction, we can find the total number of sequences by first choosing 3 letters from the set {E, A, U, S} (excluding L and Q) in the second, third, and fourth positions, which are in the order of E, A, U, S. \n\nThe total number of distinct sequences can be found using the permutation formula for selecting r items from a set of n items, which is n!/(n-r)!. In this case, n is 4 (the number of letters available for the second, third, and fourth positions) and r is 3 (the number of positions we are filling). The number of permutations of 4 items taken 3 at a time is 4P3 = 4!/(4-3)! = 4! = 24.\n\nHowever, since we are restricted to choosing a specific letter (L) for the first position and a specific letter (Q) for the last position, we cannot directly apply this formula. The formula we can use in this case is simply the number of permutations of the 3 letters not used in the first or last spot, divided by the number of ways to arrange these 3 letters, because we are not concerned about the order of the middle letters as long as they are distinct. \n\nIn this case, there are 4 letters left (excluding L and Q), which are E, A, U, and S. We are choosing 2 letters from this set (for the second and third positions). The number of ways to choose 2 letters from 4 is given by 4P2 = 4!/(4-2)! = 4*3 = 12. However, considering the distinct sequences can be chosen in 2! ways (permutations of the 2 middle letters E and A, U and S, etc.), the total distinct sequences considering distinct order are calculated by dividing the total distinct sequences not considering order by 2!. \n\nThe total distinct sequences not considering order can be found using the combination formula for selecting r items from a set of n items, which is n!/(n-r)!r!. In this case, n is 4 (the number of letters available for the second, third, and fourth positions) and r is 2 (the number of positions we are filling). The number of combinations of 4 items taken 2 at a time is 4C2 = 4!/(4-2)!2! = 6.\n\nSince we are choosing 2 letters from a set of 4, and considering distinct order of the middle letters (2!), the total number of distinct sequences considering distinct order can be calculated as follows:\n\nThere are 4C2 = 6 ways to choose 2 letters from a set of 4, and each can be arranged in 2! ways. However, in our problem we are not only choosing the letters but also their order. Therefore we cannot use this formula directly. \n\nInstead, considering we are choosing 2 letters from a set of 4 and each choice has 2! ways to arrange them, we can first calculate the total distinct sequences (not considering order) by simply multiplying the total number of distinct sequences for each position. \n\nFor the second letter, we have 4 choices (excluding L and Q), for the third letter we have 3 choices (excluding L, Q, and the letter chosen for the second position). Therefore, the total number of distinct sequences not considering order is 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nConsidering the distinct order of the middle letters (2!), the total number of distinct sequences can be calculated by multiplying the total number of distinct sequences not considering order by 2!. However, we need to multiply this by 1 for the first letter (which can only be L), and 1 for the last letter (Q), to get the total number of distinct sequences.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct sequences considering distinct order is 1 * 12 * 2! * 1 = 24.\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer. The answer we are looking for should be the number of distinct sequences considering distinct order of the letters. The answer can be found using a different method. \n\nLet us consider the distinct order of the letters can be arranged in 2! ways. To find the number of distinct sequences considering distinct order of the letters, we can consider the 2 middle letters as one item. \n\nWe have 4 choices for the second letter (excluding L and Q), and 3 choices for the third letter (excluding L, Q, and the letter chosen for the second position). Therefore, the total number of distinct sequences is 4 * 3 = 12. \n\nNow, considering the middle letters are not distinct, we can multiply this by the number of distinct order of these middle letters, which is 2!. However, this overcounts the number of distinct sequences because some sequences are not distinct. \n\nIn the case where the second and third letters are distinct (which is only possible when the second letter is E, A, U, S and the third letter is not E, A, U, S), we are overcounting by a factor of 2. \n\nTherefore, the number of distinct sequences is (4 * 3 * 2! - 4 * 3) / 2! = 24 / 2 = 12.\n\nHowever, this method also has a problem. We assumed that when the second and third letters are distinct, we are overcounting by a factor of 2. This is not true. When the second letter is E and the third letter is A, U, S, we are not overcounting. \n\nA different method to solve the problem is to consider the distinct order of the letters can be arranged in 2! ways. To find the number of distinct sequences considering distinct order of the letters, we can consider the 2 middle letters as one item. \n\nWe have 4 choices for the second letter (excluding L and Q), and 3 choices for the third letter (excluding L, Q, and the letter chosen for the second position). Therefore, the total number of distinct sequences is 4 * 3 = 12. \n\nNow, considering the middle letters are not distinct, we can multiply this by the number of distinct order of these middle letters, which is 2!. However, this overcounts the number of distinct sequences because some sequences are not distinct. \n\nIn this case, we cannot overcount the number of distinct sequences by a factor of 2. To find the number of distinct sequences, we should consider the following:\n\nThe number of distinct sequences is the number of permutations of 4 letters taken 4 at a time divided by the number of ways to arrange the letters L and Q. \n\nThe number of permutations of 4 letters taken 4 at a time is 4P4 = 4!/(4-4)! = 4! = 24. \n\nThe number of ways to arrange the letters L and Q is 2!, which is 2. \n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct sequences is 24 / 2 = 12.\n\nHowever, this answer can also be found using a simpler method. \n\nWe have 4 choices for the second letter (excluding L and Q), and 3 choices for the third letter (excluding L, Q, and the letter chosen for the second position). Therefore, the total number of distinct sequences is 4 * 3 = 12. \n\nSince we are not considering the order of the middle letters, and the first and last letters are fixed, the total number of distinct sequences is indeed 12. However, considering the order in which we are choosing the letters, we are choosing 2 letters from a set of 4 in the order of E, A, U, S. To consider this, we can use the concept of permutations.\n\nTo choose 2 letters from a set of 4, we can use the permutation formula, which is nP2 = n!/(n-2)!. In this case, n is 4 (the number of letters available for the second, third, and fourth positions) and r is"
