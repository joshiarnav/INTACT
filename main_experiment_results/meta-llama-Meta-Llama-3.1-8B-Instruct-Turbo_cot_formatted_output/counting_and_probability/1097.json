    "solution": "It is clear that the maximal positive difference is $6 - 1 = 5$. Moreover, we can use 6 to ensure that we can get all positive integer differences up to 5: $6 - 5 = 1$, $6 - 4 = 2$, $6 - 3 = 3$, $6 - 2 = 4$, $6 - 1 = 5$. So, there are $\\boxed{5}$ possible differences.",

    "model_solution": "To find the different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set, let's consider the differences that can be formed.\n\n- The largest difference will be when we subtract the smallest number from the largest number, which is $6 - 1 = 5$.\n- Next, we consider the difference between consecutive numbers: $6 - 2 = 4, 5 - 2 = 3, 4 - 2 = 2, 3 - 2 = 1, 2 - 1 = 1, 5 - 3 = 2, 4 - 3 = 1, 3 - 1 = 2, 2 - 1 = 1$.\n- Also, when we subtract the second-smallest number from the second-largest number: $5 - 2 = 3, 4 - 3 = 1$.\n- Lastly, when we subtract the third-smallest and third-largest number: $4 - 1 = 3$.\n\nConsidering all these differences, we can see that the set of different positive integers that can be represented is: $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n\nSo, the total number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set is $5$.\n\n$\\boxed{5}$"
