    "problem": "In how many ways can 8 people be seated in a row of chairs if three of the people, John, Wilma, and Paul, refuse to sit in three consecutive seats?",
    "solution": "The number of all seating arrangements is $8!$. The number of seating arrangements in which John, Wilma and Paul sit next to each other is $6!\\times 3!$. We can arrive at $6!\\times 3!$ by considering John, Wilma and Paul as one person, arranging the ``six'' people (the JWP super-person plus the 5 other people) first, then arranging John, Wilma and Paul.  Thus the number of acceptable arrangements is $$8!-6!\\times 3!=8\\times 7\\times 6! - 6!\\times 3! = (8\\times 7 - 3!)6! = (50)(720)=\\boxed{36000}.$$",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll consider the total number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row and then determine the number of ways with the restriction. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row without any restrictions. This is a permutation problem, and we have 8 people to be seated in 8 chairs. The number of ways is given by 8!. \n\n8! = 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 40,320\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row with John, Wilma, and Paul sitting in three consecutive seats. To do this, we can think of John, Wilma, and Paul as a single unit, and we have 6 units (the 5 other people + the John-Wilma-Paul unit) to be seated in 6 chairs. The number of ways to arrange these 6 units is given by 6!. However, within the John-Wilma-Paul unit, these three people can be arranged in 3! ways. Therefore, the total number of ways with John, Wilma, and Paul sitting in three consecutive seats is 6! \u00d7 3!.\n\nStep 3: Calculate 6! and 3!.\n\n6! = 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 720\n3! = 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6\n\nStep 4: Calculate 6! \u00d7 3!.\n\n6! \u00d7 3! = 720 \u00d7 6 = 4,320\n\nStep 5: To determine the number of ways 8 people can be seated in a row with John, Wilma, and Paul not sitting in three consecutive seats, we subtract the total number of ways they can be seated in three consecutive seats from the total number of ways without any restrictions.\n\nTotal number of ways without restrictions = 40,320\nTotal number of ways with John, Wilma, and Paul in three consecutive seats = 4,320\n\nNumber of ways with John, Wilma, and Paul not in three consecutive seats = 40,320 - 4,320 = 35,998\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{35,998}$."
