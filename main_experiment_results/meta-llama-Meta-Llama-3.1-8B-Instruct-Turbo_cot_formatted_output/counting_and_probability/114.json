    "problem": "Bob rolls a fair six-sided die each morning. If Bob rolls a composite number, he eats sweetened cereal. If he rolls a prime number, he eats unsweetened cereal. If he rolls a 1, then he rolls again. In a non-leap year, what is the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal?

    "solution": "Bob is equally likely to end up rolling a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Three of these numbers are prime and two are composite, so there is a $\\frac{3}{5}$ chance he will eat unsweetened cereal and a $\\frac{2}{5}$ chance that he will eat sweetened cereal. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, so the expected value of the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal is $\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot365=219$ and the expected value of the number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal is $\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot365=146$. The difference between 219 days and 146 days is $\\boxed{73}$ days.",

    "model_solution": "To find the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal, we need to first find the probability of Bob eating unsweetened and sweetened cereal.\n\nThere are 365 days in a non-leap year. \n\nBob will eat unsweetened cereal if he rolls a prime number (2, 3, or 5) which has a probability of 3/6 = 1/2. If he rolls a composite number (4, 6), he eats sweetened cereal which has a probability of 2/6. However, if he rolls a 1, he will roll again, so we need to subtract the probability of rolling a 1.\n\nThe probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6.\n\nSo, the probability of Bob eating unsweetened cereal is 1/2, and the probability of Bob eating sweetened cereal is 2/6 - 1/6 (because 1s are rolled over) = 1/6.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal.\n\nThe expected value of the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal is 365 * (probability of eating unsweetened cereal) = 365 * (1/2) = 182.5\n\nThe expected value of the number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal is 365 * (probability of eating sweetened cereal) = 365 * (1/6) = 60.83\n\nThe expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal is 182.5 - 60.83 = 121.67\n\nRounding this to two decimal places is not needed so it is 121.67.\n\nSo, the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal is $\\boxed{121.67}$."
