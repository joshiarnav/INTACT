    "problem": "Two standard dice are rolled. What is the expected number of 1's obtained? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability of rolling a number other than 1 on one die is $\\frac{5}{6}$, so the probability of rolling zero 1's on two dice is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{36}$. The probability of rolling a 1 on one die is $\\frac{1}{6}$, so the probability of rolling 1's on two dice (for a total of two 1's) is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{36}$. Since the only other possibility is rolling exactly one 1, the probability of rolling one 1 is $1-\\frac{25}{36}-\\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{10}{36}$. We find the expected number of 1's to be $E = \\frac{1}{36} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{10}{36} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{25}{36} \\cdot 0 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the expected number of 1's obtained when two standard dice are rolled, we need to consider the possible outcomes and their probabilities.\n\nWhen two dice are rolled, there are 36 possible outcomes in total, ranging from (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nWe can have the following scenarios:\n\n1. **No 1's**: This occurs when neither die shows a 1. The possible outcomes for this scenario are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), and (6,6). There are 25 possible outcomes for this scenario.\n\n2. **One 1**: This occurs when one die shows a 1 and the other die shows a number other than 1. The possible outcomes for this scenario are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), and (6,1). There are 10 possible outcomes for this scenario.\n\n3. **Two 1's**: This occurs when both dice show a 1. There is only 1 possible outcome for this scenario: (1,1).\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected number of 1's obtained.\n\nThe expected value (E) of the number of 1's obtained is given by:\n\nE = (P(no 1's) * 0) + (P(one 1) * 1) + (P(two 1's) * 2)\n\nFirst, we need to find the probabilities for each scenario:\n\nP(no 1's) = 25/36\nP(one 1) = 10/36\nP(two 1's) = 1/36\n\nNow, we can substitute these probabilities into the expected value formula:\n\nE = (25/36 * 0) + (10/36 * 1) + (1/36 * 2)\nE = 0 + 10/36 + 2/36\nE = 12/36\nE = 1/3\n\nSo, the expected number of 1's obtained when two standard dice are rolled is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
