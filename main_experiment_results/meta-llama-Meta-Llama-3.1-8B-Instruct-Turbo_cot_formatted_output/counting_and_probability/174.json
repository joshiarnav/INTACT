    "problem": "How many three-digit numbers are multiples of neither 5 nor 7?",
    "solution": "It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 5 or 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \\times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 that is a three-digit number is $142 \\times 7 = 994$.  Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7.  The smallest multiple of 5 that is a three-digit number is $20\\times 5 = 100$, and the largest multiple of 5 that is a three digit number is $199\\times 5 =995$. So there are $199-20+1=180$ multiples of 5.\n\nNow notice that we have counted some numbers twice: those multiples of $5\\times7=35$. The smallest multiple of 35 is $3\\times 35 = 105$, the largest multiple of 35 is $28\\times35 =980$. So there are $28-3+1=26$ multiples of 35.\n\nWe have 128 multiples of 7 and 180 multiples of 5, but we count 26 multiples twice.  So, there are a total of $128+180-26 = 282$ distinct three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 (or both).   There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-282=\\boxed{618}$ three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7 nor 5.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, we first need to find the total number of three-digit numbers and then subtract the numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7.\n\nThe smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999. \n\n1. Total number of three-digit numbers:\n   To find the total number of three-digit numbers, we subtract the smallest number from the largest and add 1.\n   Total = 999 - 100 + 1 = 900\n\n2. Number of multiples of 5:\n   The smallest multiple of 5 in the three-digit range is 100, and the largest is 995.\n   To find the number of multiples of 5, we need to find how many numbers are divisible by 5 in the range.\n   Number of multiples of 5 = (995 - 100) / 5 + 1 = 180\n\n3. Number of multiples of 7:\n   The smallest multiple of 7 in the three-digit range is 105, and the largest is 994.\n   To find the number of multiples of 7, we need to find how many numbers are divisible by 7 in the range.\n   Number of multiples of 7 = (994 - 105) / 7 + 1 = 128\n\n4. Number of multiples of both 5 and 7 (35):\n   The smallest multiple of 35 in the three-digit range is 105, and the largest is 980.\n   To find the number of multiples of 35, we need to find how many numbers are divisible by 35 in the range.\n   Number of multiples of 35 = (980 - 105) / 35 + 1 = 26\n\n5. Number of multiples of 5 or 7:\n   To find the number of multiples of 5 or 7, we need to add the numbers of multiples of 5 and 7 and then subtract the number of multiples of both 5 and 7 (to avoid double counting).\n   Number of multiples of 5 or 7 = Number of multiples of 5 + Number of multiples of 7 - Number of multiples of 35\n   Number of multiples of 5 or 7 = 180 + 128 - 26 = 282\n\n6. Number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7:\n   To find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, we subtract the number of multiples of 5 or 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers.\n   Number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7 = Total - Number of multiples of 5 or 7\n   Number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7 = 900 - 282 = 618\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{618}$."
