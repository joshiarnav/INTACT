    "problem": "An unfair coin lands on heads with probability $\\frac34$ and tails with probability $\\frac14$.  A heads flip gains $\\$3$, but a tails flip loses $\\$8$.  What is the expected worth of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "By definition, we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities, and add them up: $E = \\frac34(+\\$3) + \\frac14(-\\$8) = \\boxed{\\$0.25}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the expected worth of a coin flip, we need to calculate the average outcome of the possible results. \n\nStep 1: Determine the probabilities of the two possible outcomes.\n- The probability of landing on heads is $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n- The probability of landing on tails is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nStep 2: Assign the monetary values to each outcome.\n- A heads flip gains $\\$3$.\n- A tails flip loses $\\$8$.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected worth by multiplying the probability of each outcome by its corresponding monetary value and then summing these products.\n- Expected worth = (probability of heads) * (monetary value of heads) + (probability of tails) * (monetary value of tails)\n- Expected worth = $\\frac{3}{4} * \\$3 + \\frac{1}{4} * (-\\$8)$\n\nStep 4: Perform the arithmetic.\n- Expected worth = $\\$2.25 - \\$2.00$\n\nStep 5: Round the answer to the nearest hundredth.\n- Expected worth = $\\$0.25$\n\nSo, the expected worth of a coin flip is $\\boxed{0.25}$."
