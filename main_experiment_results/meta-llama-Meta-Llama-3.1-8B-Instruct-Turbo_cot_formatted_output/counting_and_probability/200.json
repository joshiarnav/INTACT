    "problem": "The probability that Kim has a math test today is $\\frac{4}{7}$. What is the probability that Kim does not have a math test today? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that Kim does not have a math test is equal to one minus the probability she does have a math test. So, the probability of not having a math test is $1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that Kim does not have a math test today, we can use the fact that the probability of an event happening plus the probability of the event not happening is equal to 1.\n\nLet's denote the probability of Kim having a math test as P(H) and the probability of Kim not having a math test as P(N).\n\nGiven that the probability of Kim having a math test is $\\frac{4}{7}$, we can write:\n\nP(H) = $\\frac{4}{7}$\n\nWe know that P(H) + P(N) = 1, so we can substitute P(H) with $\\frac{4}{7}$:\n\n$\\frac{4}{7}$ + P(N) = 1\n\nTo solve for P(N), we can subtract $\\frac{4}{7}$ from both sides:\n\nP(N) = 1 - $\\frac{4}{7}$\n\nTo subtract a fraction from 1, we can convert 1 to a fraction with the same denominator:\n\n1 = $\\frac{7}{7}$\n\nSo, P(N) = $\\frac{7}{7}$ - $\\frac{4}{7}$\n\nTo subtract fractions, we need to have the same denominator, which is 7 in this case. We can subtract the numerators while keeping the denominator the same:\n\nP(N) = $\\frac{7-4}{7}$\n\nP(N) = $\\frac{3}{7}$\n\nTherefore, the probability that Kim does not have a math test today is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$."
