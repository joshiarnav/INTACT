    "problem": "Suppose 5 different integers are randomly chosen from between 20 and 69, inclusive.  What is the probability that they each have a different tens digit?",
    "solution": "In this set of integers, there are 5 tens digits: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.  If 5 integers all have different tens digits, then there must be exactly one integer among the 5 with each tens digit.  Since there are 10 different integers for each tens digit, the number of ways to pick, without regard to order, 5 different integers with different tens digits is $10^5$.  The total number of combinations of 5 integers is $\\binom{50}{5}$.  So the probability that 5 integers drawn all have the different tens digits is $$ \\frac{10^5}{\\binom{50}{5}} = \\frac{100000}{2118760} = \\boxed{\\frac{2500}{52969}}. $$",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the 5 integers have different tens digits, we first need to understand how many possible tens digits there are in the given range. The tens digits in the range 20-69 inclusive are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nWe can select 5 integers with different tens digits in the following way: \n\n1. Choose 5 different tens digits from the 5 available (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), which can be done in $\\binom{5}{5}=1$ way, since we need all 5 digits.\n2. For each chosen tens digit, there are 10 possible ones digits (0-9), so there are $10^5=100,000$ possible combinations of ones digits for the 5 chosen tens digits.\n\nWithin the given range of 20-69 inclusive, there are 50 numbers that have each of the tens digits 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Hence, the total number of ways to choose 5 integers from the given range with different tens digits is $50^5=312,500,000$.\n\nNow we can calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 integers from the given range without any restrictions. There are 50 numbers in the range, so the total number of ways to choose 5 integers from the given range is $\\binom{50}{5}=2,118,760$.\n\nThe probability that the 5 integers have different tens digits is then $\\frac{312,500,000}{2,118,760} \\approx \\boxed{0.147}$"
