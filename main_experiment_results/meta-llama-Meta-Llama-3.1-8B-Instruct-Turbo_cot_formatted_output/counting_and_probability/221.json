    "solution": "Since $12! = 12 \\cdot 11!$, we can examine the sum better by factoring $11!$ out of both parts: $$ 11! + 12! = 11! + 12 \\cdot 11! = 11!(1 + 12) = 11! \\cdot 13. $$Since no prime greater than 11 divides $11!$, $\\boxed{13}$ is the largest prime factor of $11! + 12!$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest prime divisor of 11! + 12!, let's first analyze the expression 11! + 12!. \n\nSince 12! = 12 * 11!, we can rewrite the expression as 11! + 12! = 11! + 12 * 11!. \n\nFactoring out 11!, we get 11!(1 + 12) = 11! * 13.\n\nNow, we can see that 11! * 13 is the product of two numbers: 11! and 13. \n\nThe largest prime factor of 11! will be the largest prime number less than or equal to 11, which is 11 itself. However, we need to consider that 11 is a factor of 11!, and as a result, the largest prime factor of 11! actually is 7 (The largest prime less than 11, which 11! contains) but we actually need to ensure it's not 13 since 13 is a factor of 11! * 13 and 13 is a prime number, thus larger than 7. \n\nThe largest prime factor of 11! * 13 will be the larger of 11! and 13. In this case, it will be 13, since 13 is a prime number and larger than any prime number contained in 11!. \n\nTherefore, the largest prime divisor of 11! + 12! is 13.\n\n$\\boxed{13}$"
