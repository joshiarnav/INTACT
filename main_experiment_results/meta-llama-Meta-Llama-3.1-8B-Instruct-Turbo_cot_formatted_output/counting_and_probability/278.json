    "problem": "After a gymnastics meet, each gymnast shook hands once with every gymnast on every team (except herself). Afterwards, a coach came down and only shook hands with each gymnast from her own team. There were a total of 281 handshakes. What is the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in?",
    "solution": "The number of gymnasts is some integer $n$, so that the number of gymnast-gymnast handshakes is ${n \\choose 2}$ for some $n$. Also, the coach must participate in an integer $k<n$ number of handshakes. So, ${n \\choose 2} + k = 281$. If we want to minimize $k$, we need the maximal $n$ such that ${n \\choose 2} \\le 281$, which implies $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 281$ or $n^2 - n - 562 \\le 0 $. So, the maximal $n$ is 24. So, $k = 281 - {24 \\choose 2} = 281 - 12 \\cdot 23 = 281 - 276 = \\boxed{5}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in, we need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nLet's denote the total number of gymnasts as $n$. Each gymnast shook hands once with every gymnast on every team (except herself), so the number of handshakes between gymnasts is:\n\n$\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$\n\nThis is because each gymnast shakes hands with $n-1$ gymnasts, and there are $n$ gymnasts in total, so the total number of handshakes is $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\n\nHowever, this counts each handshake twice, so we need to divide by 2 to get the actual number of handshakes.\n\nNow, let's consider the coach. The coach only shook hands with each gymnast from her own team, so the number of handshakes the coach participated in is less than or equal to $n$.\n\nThe total number of handshakes is 281, so we can set up the equation:\n\n$\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + k = 281$\n\nwhere $k$ is the number of handshakes the coach participated in.\n\nWe want to find the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in, so we want to minimize $k$.\n\nSince $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ must be an integer, we can try to find a value of $n$ that makes this expression close to 281.\n\nNotice that $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ is always less than or equal to $\\frac{n^2}{2}$, and since $\\frac{n^2}{2}$ is an integer for even values of $n$, we can try even values of $n$.\n\nLet's try $n=24$, which gives:\n\n$\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \\frac{24(24-1)}{2} = 276$\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$276 + k = 281$\n\nSubtracting 276 from both sides gives:\n\n$k = 5$\n\nTherefore, the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in is $\\boxed{5}$."
