    "problem": "William is taking the 25-question, multiple choice American Mathematics Competition. Each question has five answer choices. William guesses random answers for the last four questions. What is the probability that he will get at least one of these final four questions right?",
    "solution": "We find the probability that William misses the last four questions, and subtract from 1. The probability of William missing a question is $\\frac{4}{5}$, so the probability that he misses all four is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = \\frac{256}{625}$. The probability that he gets at least one right is $1-\\frac{256}{625} =\\boxed{\\frac{369}{625}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that William will get at least one of the final four questions right, we can use the complement rule. This rule states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring.\n\nIn this case, let's find the probability that William gets none of the questions right.\n\nFor each question, there are 5 answer choices and only 1 is correct. So, the probability that William gets a question wrong is $\\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nSince William is guessing random answers for the last 4 questions, we can assume that the questions are independent. This means that the probability of getting a question wrong is the same for each question.\n\nTo find the probability that William gets all 4 questions wrong, we need to multiply the probabilities of getting each question wrong:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = \\frac{256}{625}$\n\nNow, we can use the complement rule to find the probability that William gets at least one question right:\n\n$1 - \\frac{256}{625} = \\frac{369}{625}$\n\nSo, the probability that William will get at least one of the final four questions right is $\\boxed{\\frac{369}{625}}$."
