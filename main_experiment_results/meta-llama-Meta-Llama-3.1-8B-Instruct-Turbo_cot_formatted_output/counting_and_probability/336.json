    "problem": "How many positive multiples of $7$ that are less than $1000$ end with the digit $3$?",
    "solution": "Listing the first 10 multiples of 7, which are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, we see that the only positive multiples of 7 that end in 3 are those that are the product of 7 and a number that ends in 9.  Therefore, the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3 are $7\\cdot 9 = 63$, $7\\cdot 19= 133$, $7\\cdot 29 = 203$, . . .  Notice that we can get from each to the next by adding $7\\cdot 10 = 70$, so our multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 are 63, 133, 203, . . ., 903, 973.  The last one is 910 more than the first. Since $910/70=13$, we see that we have taken 13 steps of 70 to get from the first number in the list to the last. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{14}$ numbers in the list.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the problem**: We need to find the number of positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3.\n\n2. **Identify the pattern**: Multiples of 7 have a repeating pattern of digits. To end with the digit 3, the multiples must follow the pattern 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147, 154, 161, 168, 175, 182, 189, 196, 203, 210, 217, 224, 231, 238, 245, 252, 259, 266, 273, 280, 287, 294, 301, 308, 315, 322, 329, 336, 343, 350, 357, 364, 371, 378, 385, 392, 399, 406, 413, 420, 427, 434, 441, 448, 455, 462, 469, 476, 483, 490, 497, 504, 511, 518, 525, 532, 539, 546, 553, 560, 567, 574, 581, 588, 595, 602, 609, 616, 623, 630, 637, 644, 651, 658, 665, 672, 679, 686, 693, 700, 707, 714, 721, 728, 735, 742, 749, 756, 763, 770, 777, 784, 791, 798, 805, 812, 819, 826, 833, 840, 847, 854, 861, 868, 875, 882, 889, 896, 903, 910, 917, 924, 931, 938, 945, 952, 959, 966, 973, 980, 987, 994, 1001. Since we're looking for the numbers that end with 3, we are looking for multiples ending with 3 that have a 7 in the ones place.\n\n3. **Find the pattern for multiples that end with 3**: By examining the pattern of multiples of 7, we notice that the numbers that end with the digit 3 follow the sequence 7, 63, 133, 203, 273, 343, 413, 483, 553, 623, 693, 763, 833, 903, 973. \n\n4. **Count the numbers in the pattern**: We have 15 numbers in the pattern.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{15}$."
