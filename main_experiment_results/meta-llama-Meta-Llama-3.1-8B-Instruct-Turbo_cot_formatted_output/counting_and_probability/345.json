    "problem": "If two distinct numbers are selected at random from the first seven prime numbers, what is the probability that their sum is an even number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2. There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum IS even is $1-\\frac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers is even, we need to first understand what makes a sum even.\n\nA sum is even if both numbers are even or both numbers are odd. \n\nNow, let's list the first seven prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\nThere is only 1 even prime number in this list, which is 2. The rest are odd. \n\nLet's consider the possible cases:\n\n1. We pick the even number 2 and another even number (which is not possible in this list since there is only 1 even number), or\n2. We pick two odd numbers.\n\nWe can ignore case 1 since it's not possible.\n\nFor case 2, we need to count the number of ways to pick two odd numbers from the remaining 6 odd numbers.\n\nWe can pick the first number in 6 ways (we can pick any of the 6 odd numbers) and the second number in 5 ways (we can pick any of the remaining 5 odd numbers). However, we need to divide this by 2 since we are counting each pair twice (e.g., we count (3,5) and (5,3) as two different pairs, but they are the same). \n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick two odd numbers is 6 * 5 / 2 = 15.\n\nThe total number of ways to pick two numbers from the 7 prime numbers is 7 * 6 / 2 = 21.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers is even by dividing the number of ways to pick two odd numbers by the total number of ways to pick two numbers:\n\nProbability = 15 / 21\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:\n\nProbability = 5 / 7\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers is even is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$."
