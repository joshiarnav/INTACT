    "problem": "If Anna flips 8 coins, what is the probability that she gets more heads than tails?",
    "solution": "We could solve this problem using casework, but using a little bit of symmetry and complementary probability gives us a more elegant solution. Since each coin flips heads and tails with equal probability, by the principle of symmetry the probability of getting more heads than tails is the equal to the probability of getting more tails than heads. Additionally, there are only three possible outcomes: getting more heads than tails, getting more tails than heads, or getting the same number of both. If we let $x$ represent the probability of the first outcome (which is the same as the probability of the second outcome) and $y$ represent the probability of the third outcome, we get the equation $2x + y = 1 \\Rightarrow x=\\dfrac{1-y}{2}$. So all we need to do is calculate the probability of getting the same number of heads and tails and we can then easily solve for what we want using the principle of complementary probability. Since there are two equally likely outcomes for each flip, there are a total of $2^8$ equally likely possible outcomes for flipping the 8 coins. We will have the same number of both heads and tails if we have exactly 4 of each, which we can count by selecting 4 out of the 8 flips to be heads which can occur in $\\binom{8}{4}=70$ ways. So $y=\\dfrac{70}{256}=\\dfrac{35}{128}$, and substituting that back into our first equation gives us the probability that we want: $x=\\boxed{\\dfrac{93}{256}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that Anna gets more heads than tails, we need to consider the total number of outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes.\n\n1. **Total number of outcomes**: Since each coin has 2 possible outcomes (head or tail), and there are 8 coins, the total number of outcomes is 2^8 = 256.\n\n2. **Favorable outcomes**: We want to find the number of outcomes where Anna gets more heads than tails. This can be broken down into three cases:\n\n   a. Anna gets 5 heads and 3 tails.\n   b. Anna gets 6 heads and 2 tails.\n   c. Anna gets 7 heads and 1 tail.\n   d. Anna gets 8 heads and 0 tails.\n\n   We can calculate the number of ways for each case using combinations (n choose k):\n\n   a. 8 choose 5 = 56 ways\n   b. 8 choose 6 = 28 ways\n   c. 8 choose 7 = 8 ways\n   d. 8 choose 8 = 1 way\n\n   The total number of favorable outcomes is 56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 93.\n\n3. **Probability**: To find the probability, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes:\n\n   Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)\n   = 93 / 256\n   \u2248 0.36328125\n\nHowever, this probability is not in the required format. To put it in the format $\\boxed{answer}$, we need to simplify the fraction:\n\n   Probability = 93 / 256\n   = (93/3) / (256/3)\n   = 31 / 85.333 (approximately)\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction in the box, we will have it in the decimal format and round it to the nearest four decimal places:\n\n   Probability \u2248 0.3633\n\nHowever, the exact fraction is not in the decimal format, so let's leave it in the fraction format and get the closest fraction where the denominator and the numerator are in the format of $\\boxed{answer}$."
