    "solution": "There are 8 Republicans and 3 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ ways to choose the Republicans.  There are 6 Democrats and 2 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose the Democrats.  So there are $56 \\times 15 = \\boxed{840}$ ways to choose the subcommittee.",

    "model_solution": "To form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats, we need to consider the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8 and 2 Democrats from 6.\n\nStep 1: Choose 3 Republicans from 8. This can be calculated using combinations (denoted as C(n, k), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose). So, we have:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * (8 - 3)!)\n= 8! / (3! * 5!)\n= (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n= (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n= 56\n\nStep 2: Choose 2 Democrats from 6.\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6 - 2)!)\n= 6! / (2! * 4!)\n= (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1) * (4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n= (6 * 5) / (2 * 1)\n= 15\n\nStep 3: Now, we need to find the total number of ways to form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats. This can be done by multiplying the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats.\n\nTotal ways = C(8, 3) * C(6, 2)\n= 56 * 15\n= 840\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{840}$."
