    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable but the boxes are?",
    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of balls in the different boxes.\n\nThere are $3$ ways to arrange the balls as $(5,0,0)$ (specifically, box 1 can have 5, box 2 can have 5, box 3 can have 5).\n\nThere are $3! = 6$ to arrange $(4,1,0)$ and $3! = 6$ ways to arrange $(3,2,0)$; in each case, we must choose one of the 3 boxes to have the largest number of balls, and also one of the remaining two boxes to be left empty.\n\nHowever, there are only $3$ ways to arrange $(3,1,1)$, and $3$ ways to arrange $(2,2,1)$; in each case, we must choose one box to have the `different' number of balls (3 in the $(3,1,1)$ case and 1 in the $(2,2,1)$ case).\n\nThis gives a total of $3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = \\boxed{21}$ arrangements.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of \"stars and bars.\" \n\nImagine we have 5 stars (representing the balls) and 2 bars (representing the divisions between the boxes). We can arrange these stars and bars in different ways to represent different distributions of balls in the boxes.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- Each group of stars between two bars represents a box.\n- The number of stars in each group represents the number of balls in that box.\n\nLet's consider the possible arrangements of the stars and bars:\n\n1. We can arrange the stars and bars in a single group, like this: `**|**|**` (3 balls in each box). This is one arrangement.\n2. We can have 0 balls in one box and 5 balls in the other box, like this: `*****|` or `|*****`. This is two arrangements.\n3. We can have 1 ball in one box and 4 balls in the other box, like this: `*|****` or `****|*`. This is two arrangements.\n4. We can have 2 balls in one box and 3 balls in the other box, like this: `**|***` or `***|**`. This is two arrangements.\n\nNow, let's count the number of arrangements:\n\n1. 1 arrangement (all 5 balls in one box)\n2. 2 arrangements (0 balls in one box, 5 balls in the other)\n3. 2 arrangements (1 ball in one box, 4 balls in the other)\n4. 2 arrangements (2 balls in one box, 3 balls in the other)\n\nIn total, we have 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 possible arrangements.\n\nHowever, we need to consider that we are only using 2 bars to divide the stars into 3 groups. This means that we need to multiply the number of arrangements by the number of ways to choose 2 positions for the bars out of 7 positions (5 stars + 2 bars). This is a combination calculation, which is 7 choose 2.\n\nSo, the correct number of arrangements is 7 choose 2, which is equal to 21.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{21}$"
