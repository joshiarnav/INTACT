    "problem": "How many distinct triangles can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube? (Two triangles are distinct if they have different locations in space.)",
    "solution": "There are eight vertices of a cube, and we choose three of these to form a triangle. Thus, the number of distinct triangles that can be formed is $\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8\\cdot7\\cdot6}{3\\cdot2} = \\boxed{56}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of distinct triangles that can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. A cube has 8 vertices. To form a triangle, we need to choose 3 different vertices.\n\n2. The number of ways to choose 3 vertices from 8 is given by the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\n   Here, n = 8 (total number of vertices) and r = 3 (number of vertices to choose).\n   C(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n   C(8, 3) = 8! / (3!5!)\n   C(8, 3) = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1)(5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n   C(8, 3) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n   C(8, 3) = 336 / 6\n   C(8, 3) = 56\n\n3. Therefore, there are 56 distinct triangles that can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{56}$."
