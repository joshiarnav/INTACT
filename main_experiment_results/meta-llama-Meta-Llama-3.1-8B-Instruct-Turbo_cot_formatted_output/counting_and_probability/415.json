    "problem": "The numbers from 1 to 150, inclusive, are placed in a bag and a number is randomly selected from the bag. What is the probability it is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "It is easier to count the number of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. We see there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150, namely $1^{2}, 2^{2}, \\ldots, 12^{2}$, and there are 5 perfect cubes, namely $1^{3}, \\ldots, 5^{3}$. Then notice there are two repetitions, $1^{6} =1^2 = 1^3 = 1$ and $2^{6} = 8^2 = 4^3 = 64$. So there is a total of $12+5-2=15$ integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Thus, we get $150-15=135$ integers from 1 to 150 that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes. So the probability that we select such a number is $\\frac{135}{150} = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that a randomly selected number from 1 to 150 is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube, we need to first count the numbers that are perfect squares or perfect cubes.\n\n**Perfect Squares:**\n\nWe need to find the perfect squares from 1 to 150. The perfect squares in this range are:\n\n1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, and 144.\n\nThere are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150.\n\n**Perfect Cubes:**\n\nWe need to find the perfect cubes from 1 to 150:\n\n1, 8, 27, 64, and 125.\n\nThere are 5 perfect cubes from 1 to 150. However, notice that 64 is both a perfect square and a perfect cube. So, we need to subtract 1 to avoid double-counting.\n\n**Numbers that are both Perfect Squares and Perfect Cubes:**\n\nWe have already counted 64 twice, once as a perfect square and once as a perfect cube. We need to subtract 1 to avoid double-counting.\n\n**Numbers that are Perfect Squares or Perfect Cubes:**\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of perfect squares or perfect cubes. We add the number of perfect squares (12) and the number of perfect cubes (5), and subtract 1 to avoid double-counting:\n\n12 + 5 - 1 = 16\n\n**Numbers that are not Perfect Squares or Perfect Cubes:**\n\nThere are 150 numbers in total, and 16 of them are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Therefore, the number of numbers that are not perfect squares or perfect cubes is:\n\n150 - 16 = 134\n\n**Probability:**\n\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes (numbers that are not perfect squares or perfect cubes) divided by the total number of outcomes:\n\nProbability = (134/150) = (67/75)\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected number from 1 to 150 is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube is:\n\n$\\boxed{ \\frac{67}{75} }$"
