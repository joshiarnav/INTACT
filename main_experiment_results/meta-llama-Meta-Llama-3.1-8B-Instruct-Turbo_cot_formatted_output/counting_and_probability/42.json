    "problem": "How many different positive, four-digit integers can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9 and 9?",
    "solution": "We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting. That is, if we had 4 distinct digits, there would be $4! = 24$ orderings. However, we must divide by 2! once for the repetition of the digit 2, and divide by 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digit were different we would have twice as many orderings). So, our answer is $\\frac{4!}{2!\\cdot 2!} = 2 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{6}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Total number of digits**: We have 4 digits to arrange: 2, 2, 9, and 9.\n\n2. **Repetition of digits**: Both the digits 2 and 9 repeat twice. This means we have to consider permutations with repetition.\n\n3. **Number of permutations with repetition**: For 4 digits with 2 repeated twice and one other repeated twice, we can use the formula for permutations of a set with repeated elements:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{n!}{a!b!}\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - $n$ is the total number of elements (4 in this case),\n   - $a$ is the number of times the first repeated element appears (2 for digit 2),\n   - $b$ is the number of times the second repeated element appears (2 for digit 9).\n\n   Substituting these values into the formula:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{4!}{2!2!}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the factorial values**:\n   \\[\n   4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substituting the factorial values into the formula**:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{24}{2 \\times 2} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total number of different positive, four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9 is $\\boxed{6}$."
