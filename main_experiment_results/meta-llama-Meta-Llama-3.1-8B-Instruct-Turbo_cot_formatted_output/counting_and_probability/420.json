    "problem": "In how many different ways can four students stand in a straight line if two of the students refuse to stand next to each other?",
    "solution": "We will count the number of ways in which the two students do stand next to each other and then subtract that from the total number of ways all four students can stand in a line without the restriction. If the two students stand next to each other, then we can treat them as a block. There are three blocks: two one-student blocks and one two-student block. We can arrange the blocks in $3!=6$ ways, and there are 2 ways to arrange the students within the two-student block, for a total of $6\\cdot2=12$ ways. The total number of ways to arrange all four students in a line without restrictions is $4!=24$ ways. Thus, the number of ways with the restriction is $24-12=\\boxed{12}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of ways four students can stand in a straight line, with two of the students refusing to stand next to each other, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Total number of arrangements without restrictions**: We first find the total number of ways the four students can stand in a line without any restrictions. This can be calculated using the factorial of 4 (4!), since there are four choices for the first position, three for the second, two for the third, and one for the fourth.\n\n   4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n\n   So, there are 24 ways the four students can stand in a line without any restrictions.\n\n2. **Total number of arrangements where the two students stand together**: Now, let's find the number of ways the two students who refuse to stand next to each other can be together. We can treat these two students as a single entity, or \"block.\" Along with the other two students, this makes three entities in total. The number of arrangements of these three entities (two students and one block) is 3! = 6.\n\n   Within the block of two students, there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange the students (either student can be on the left or right). Therefore, the total number of arrangements where the two students stand together is 6 * 2 = 12.\n\n3. **Number of arrangements where the two students do not stand together**: To find the number of arrangements where the two students do not stand next to each other, we subtract the number of arrangements where the two students stand together from the total number of arrangements without restrictions.\n\n   Number of arrangements where two students do not stand together = Total number of arrangements without restrictions - Total number of arrangements where the two students stand together\n   = 24 - 12\n   = 12\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{12}$ different ways the four students can stand in a straight line if two of the students refuse to stand next to each other."
