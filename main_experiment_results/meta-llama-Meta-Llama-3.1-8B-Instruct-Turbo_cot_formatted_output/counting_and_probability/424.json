    "problem": "How many three digit numbers are left if we exclude all three digit numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent?",
    "solution": "The only three digit numbers which are ruled out are numbers of the form $ABA$, where A and B are different digits. There are 9 ways to choose A, since it can't be 0, and once A has been chosen there are 9 ways to choose B. Since there are $9\\cdot10\\cdot10=900$ total three digit numbers, and $9\\cdot9=81$ numbers which aren't valid, there are $900-81=\\boxed{819}$ valid numbers.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of three-digit numbers left, let's first consider how many three-digit numbers there are in total. There are 9 choices for the first digit (1-9) and 10 choices for each of the second and third digits (0-9). So, the total number of three-digit numbers is 9 * 10 * 10 = 900.\n\nNow, let's consider the numbers we need to exclude. These are the three-digit numbers in which exactly two digits are the same, but these two digits are not adjacent. \n\nFor such a number, there are 9 choices for the repeated digit (1-9) and 9 choices for the position of the other digit (second or third position). This gives us 9 * 2 = 18 choices for the repeated digit and the position of the other digit.\n\nFor each of these 18 choices, there are 9 choices for the non-repeated digit (1-9 excluding the digit that is repeated). So, the total number of three-digit numbers we need to exclude is 18 * 9 = 162.\n\nTherefore, the number of three-digit numbers left is 900 - 162 = 738.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{738}$."
