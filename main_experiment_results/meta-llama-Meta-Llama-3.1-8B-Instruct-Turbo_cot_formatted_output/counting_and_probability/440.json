    "model_solution": "To find the probability that $x+y \\le 4$, we need to find the area of the region where $x+y \\le 4$ and divide it by the total area of the region.\n\nFirst, let's find the total area of the region. The total area is a rectangle with a base of 3 and a height of 6, so the total area is:\n\nTotal area = base \u00d7 height = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n\nNow, let's find the area of the region where $x+y \\le 4$. This is a trapezoid with two parallel sides of length 4 and 1, and a height of 1.\n\nThe area of a trapezoid is given by:\n\nArea = (1/2) \u00d7 (sum of parallel sides) \u00d7 height\n= (1/2) \u00d7 (4 + 1) \u00d7 1\n= (1/2) \u00d7 5 \u00d7 1\n= 5/2\n\nHowever, this trapezoid does not lie entirely in the given rectangle, the part outside the rectangle is the triangle with base 1 and height 1, so we should only take the area of the trapezoid that is in the rectangle, which is:\n\n5/2 - 1/2 = 2\n\nHowever, we are given that one of the sides of the trapezoid is 1, we should find the area where x+y = 4, this is a line in the rectangle, we can see that this line goes from (1,3) to (3,1), this is a right-angled triangle, with base 2 and height 2.\n\nSo the area of this triangle is:\n\nArea = (1/2) \u00d7 base \u00d7 height\n= (1/2) \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2\n= (1/2) \u00d7 4\n= 2\n\nHowever, we are only interested in the area where x+y <= 4, this area is a trapezoid minus a triangle, the area of the trapezoid is 2, and the area of the triangle is 2, but the triangle is inside the trapezoid, so we should only take the area of the trapezoid, which is 2.\n\nHowever, the trapezoid is not the right shape, we should find the area where x+y <= 4, this area is a rectangle with a base of 3 and a height of 4 minus a triangle with base 3 and height 1.\n\nSo the area of the rectangle is:\n\nArea = base \u00d7 height\n= 3 \u00d7 4\n= 12\n\nThe area of the triangle is:\n\nArea = (1/2) \u00d7 base \u00d7 height\n= (1/2) \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1\n= (1/2) \u00d7 3\n= 3/2\n\nSo the area where x+y <= 4 is:\n\n12 - 3/2\n= 24/2 - 3/2\n= 21/2\n\nHowever, this is the wrong area, we should only take the area where x+y <= 4 and 0 <= y <= 6. \n\nThe area where x+y <= 4 and 0 <= y <= 6 is a trapezoid, with two parallel sides of length 4 and 1, and a height of 3.\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is:\n\nArea = (1/2) \u00d7 (sum of parallel sides) \u00d7 height\n= (1/2) \u00d7 (4 + 1) \u00d7 3\n= (1/2) \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3\n= (5/2) \u00d7 3\n= 15/2\n\nHowever, this is not the right area, we should only take the area where x+y <= 4 and 0 <= x <= 3. \n\nThe area where x+y <= 4 and 0 <= x <= 3 is a trapezoid, with two parallel sides of length 1 and 3, and a height of 3.\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is:\n\nArea = (1/2) \u00d7 (sum of parallel sides) \u00d7 height\n= (1/2) \u00d7 (1 + 3) \u00d7 3\n= (1/2) \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3\n= 2 \u00d7 3\n= 6\n\nHowever, this is not the right area, we should only take the area where x+y <= 4 and 0 <= x <= 3 and 0 <= y <= 6. \n\nThe area where x+y <= 4 and 0 <= x <= 3 and 0 <= y <= 6 is a trapezoid, with two parallel sides of length 1 and 3, and a height of 3 minus a triangle with base 3 and height 1.\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is:\n\nArea = (1/2) \u00d7 (sum of parallel sides) \u00d7 height\n= (1/2) \u00d7 (1 + 3) \u00d7 3\n= (1/2) \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3\n= 2 \u00d7 3\n= 6\n\nThe area of the triangle is:\n\nArea = (1/2) \u00d7 base \u00d7 height\n= (1/2) \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1\n= (1/2) \u00d7 3\n= 3/2\n\nSo the area where x+y <= 4 and 0 <= x <= 3 and 0 <= y <= 6 is:\n\n6 -
