    "problem": "There are 12 different-colored crayons in a box. How many ways can Karl select four crayons if the order in which he draws them out does not matter?",
    "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of ways Karl can select four crayons from a box of 12, we need to use the concept of combinations.\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem - We are looking for the number of ways to choose 4 crayons from a set of 12, where the order of selection does not matter.\n\nStep 2: Use the combination formula - The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1).\n\nIn this case, n = 12 (total number of crayons) and k = 4 (number of crayons to choose).\n\nStep 3: Plug in the values - \n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4!(12-4)!)\n\nStep 4: Simplify the expression - \n\n12! = 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1\n4! = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1\n(12-4)! = 8! = 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1\n\nC(12, 4) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)\n\nStep 5: Calculate the result - \n\nC(12, 4) = 11,880 / 24\n\nC(12, 4) = 495\n\nSo, the number of ways Karl can select four crayons from a box of 12 is: \n\n$\\boxed{495}$"
