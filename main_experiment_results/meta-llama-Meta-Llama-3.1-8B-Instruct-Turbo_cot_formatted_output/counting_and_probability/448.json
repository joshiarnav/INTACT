    "solution": "Since $N!=(N-1)!(N)$, we can rewrite the given fraction as $\\frac{N!}{(N+1)!}$. We can rewrite the denominator as $(N+1)!=(N!)(N+1)$, so the fraction becomes $\\frac{N!}{(N!)(N+1)}$. Canceling an $N!$ from the numerator and denominator, we are left with $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{N+1}}$.",

We know that \\((N-1)! = (N-1)(N-2)(N-3)...(2)(1)\\) and \\((N+1)! = (N+1)(N)(N-1)(N-2)(N-3)...(2)(1)\\).\n\nStep 2: We can cancel out the common terms, \\((N-1)(N-2)(N-3)...(2)(1)\\), in the numerator and denominator.\n\nStep 3: The numerator becomes \\(N\\), and the denominator becomes \\((N+1)(N)\\).\n\nStep 4: We can simplify the expression further by canceling out one of the \\(N\\) terms in the numerator and denominator.\n\nStep 5: The final expression becomes \\(\\frac{N}{(N+1)(N)}\\).\n\nStep 6: Cancel out the \\(N\\) term in the numerator and denominator.\n\nStep 7: The final expression becomes \\(\\frac{1}{N+1}\\).\n\nSo, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{N+1}}\\)."
