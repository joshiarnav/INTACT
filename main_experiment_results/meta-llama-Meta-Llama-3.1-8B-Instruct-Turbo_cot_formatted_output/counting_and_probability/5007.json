    "problem": "What is the largest $2$-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$?\n",
    "solution": "Expanding the binomial coefficient, we get ${200 \\choose 100}=\\frac{200!}{100!100!}$. Let the required prime be $p$; then $10 \\le p < 100$. If $p > 50$, then the factor of $p$ appears twice in the denominator. Thus, we need $p$ to appear as a factor at least three times in the numerator, so $3p<200$. The largest such prime is $\\boxed{61}$, which is our answer.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest 2-digit prime factor of the integer ${200\\choose 100}$, we can start by calculating the value of ${200\\choose 100}$. However, this can be done more efficiently using the property of combinations:\n\n$${n\\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\n\nSo, let's substitute $n = 200$ and $k = 100$:\n\n$${200\\choose 100} = \\frac{200!}{100!100!}$$\n\nWe don't need to calculate the full value of this expression. Instead, we can focus on finding its prime factors.\n\nNotice that any factor of ${200\\choose 100}$ must be a factor of $200!$. The prime factors of a factorial can be found by multiplying the prime numbers up to the factorial's value. \n\nFor $200!$, the prime factors will be: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199$\n\nWe can use the property of combinations to eliminate some of the smaller prime factors on the other side of the equation, i.e. $100!100!$. The largest prime factor on this side will be: $97$\n\nSo removing all prime factors of $100!100!$ from the list, we are left with the following prime factors of ${200\\choose 100}$: $199, 197, 193, 191, 181, 179, 173, 167, 163, 157, 151, 149, 139, 137, 131, 127, 113, 109, 107, 103, 101, 97$\n\nNow we need to find the largest 2-digit prime factor of ${200\\choose 100}$. From the list of prime factors we have found, the largest 2-digit prime factor is $\\boxed{97}$."
