    "problem": "Let $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ be the vertices of a regular tetrahedron each of whose edges measures 1 meter. A bug, starting from vertex $A$, observes the following rule: at each vertex it chooses one of the three edges meeting at that vertex, each edge being equally likely to be chosen, and crawls along that edge to the vertex at its opposite end. Let $p = \\frac n{729}$ be the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ when it has crawled exactly 7 meters. Find the value of $n$.\n",
    "solution": "Let $P(n)$ denote the probability that the bug is at $A$ after it has crawled $n$ meters. Since the bug can only be at vertex $A$ if it just left a vertex which is not $A$, we have $P(n + 1) = \\frac13 (1 - P(n))$. We also know $P(0) = 1$, so we can quickly compute $P(1)=0$, $P(2) = \\frac 13$, $P(3) = \\frac29$, $P(4) = \\frac7{27}$, $P(5) = \\frac{20}{81}$, $P(6) = \\frac{61}{243}$ and $P(7) = \\frac{182}{729}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{182}$. One can solve this recursion fairly easily to determine a closed-form expression for $P(n)$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ when it has crawled exactly 7 meters, we can define a recursive function $P(n)$ as the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ after crawling $n$ meters.\n\nWe are given that $P(0) = 1$ since the bug starts at vertex $A$. Now, let's consider the function $P(n+1)$.\n\nFor the bug to be at vertex $A$ after crawling $n+1$ meters, it must have been at a different vertex after crawling $n$ meters. The probability of this happening is $\\frac{1}{3}$ since the bug will choose one of the three edges meeting at that vertex, each edge being equally likely to be chosen.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$$P(n+1) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(n))$$\n\nNow, we can use this recursive function to find $P(7)$.\n\nWe have:\n\n$P(1) = 0$ since the bug is not at vertex $A$ after crawling 1 meter.\n\n$P(2) = \\frac{1}{3}$ since the bug is at vertex $A$ if it crawls back to vertex $A$ after crawling 1 meter.\n\n$P(3) = \\frac{2}{9}$ since the bug is at vertex $A$ if it crawls back to vertex $A$ after crawling 2 meters.\n\n$P(4) = \\frac{7}{27}$ since the bug is at vertex $A$ if it crawls back to vertex $A$ after crawling 3 meters.\n\n$P(5) = \\frac{20}{81}$ since the bug is at vertex $A$ if it crawls back to vertex $A$ after crawling 4 meters.\n\n$P(6) = \\frac{61}{243}$ since the bug is at vertex $A$ if it crawls back to vertex $A$ after crawling 5 meters.\n\n$P(7) = \\frac{182}{729}$ since the bug is at vertex $A$ if it crawls back to vertex $A$ after crawling 6 meters.\n\nNow, we can combine all the equations:\n\n$P(1) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(0)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - 1) = 0$\n\n$P(2) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(1)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - 0) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n$P(3) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(2)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{2}{9}$\n\n$P(4) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(3)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - \\frac{2}{9}) = \\frac{7}{27}$\n\n$P(5) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(4)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - \\frac{7}{27}) = \\frac{20}{81}$\n\n$P(6) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(5)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - \\frac{20}{81}) = \\frac{61}{243}$\n\n$P(7) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(6)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - \\frac{61}{243}) = \\frac{182}{729}$\n\nNow, we can see that $\\frac{182}{729} = \\frac{n}{729}$ where $n = 182$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{182}$"
