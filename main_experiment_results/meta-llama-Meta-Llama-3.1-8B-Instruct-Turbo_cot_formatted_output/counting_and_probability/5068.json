    "problem": "Seven teams play a soccer tournament in which each team plays every other team exactly once. No ties occur, each team has a $50\\%$ chance of winning each game it plays, and the outcomes of the games are independent. In each game, the winner is awarded a point and the loser gets 0 points. The total points are accumilated to decide the ranks of the teams. In the first game of the tournament, team $A$ beats team $B.$ The probability that team $A$ finishes with more points than team $B$ is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$\n",
    "solution": "The results of the five remaining games are independent of the first game, so by symmetry, the probability that $A$ scores higher than $B$ in these five games is equal to the probability that $B$ scores higher than $A$. We let this probability be $p$; then the probability that $A$ and $B$ end with the same score in these five games is $1-2p$.\nOf these three cases ($|A| > |B|, |A| < |B|, |A|=|B|$), the last is the easiest to calculate (see solution 2 for a way to directly calculate the other cases).\nThere are ${5\\choose k}$ ways to $A$ to have $k$ victories, and ${5\\choose k}$ ways for $B$ to have $k$ victories. Summing for all values of $k$,\n$1-2p = \\frac{1}{2^{5} \\times 2^{5}}\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{5} {5\\choose k}^2\\right) = \\frac{1^2+5^2+10^2+10^2+5^2+1^2}{1024} = \\frac{126}{512}.$\nThus $p = \\frac 12 \\left(1-\\frac{126}{512}\\right) = \\frac{193}{512}$. The desired probability is the sum of the cases when $|A| \\ge |B|$, so the answer is $\\frac{126}{512} + \\frac{193}{512} = \\frac{319}{512}$, and $m+n = \\boxed{831}$.",

    "model_solution": "To start, we can simplify the problem by realizing that the results of the games including team $A$ are the same regardless of the results of the games including teams $C, D, E, F, G.$ We can also simplify the problem by considering the results of the five games involving $A.$\n\nWe can split into cases based off the number of wins $A$ has. \n\nCase 1: $A$ has $0$ or $1$ wins \nIn this case, we can calculate the probability of $B$ having more or equal wins and the probability of $B$ having less wins.\n\nCase 2: $A$ has $2$ wins \nIn this case, we can calculate the probability of $B$ having more or equal wins and the probability of $B$ having less wins.\n\nCase 3: $A$ has $3$ or more wins \nIn this case, we can calculate the probability of $B$ having more or equal wins and the probability of $B$ having less wins.\n\nHowever, we can also simplify the problem by calculating the probability of $B$ having more or equal wins and the probability of $B$ having less wins directly.\n\nTo calculate the probability of $B$ having more or equal wins, we can use a stars and bars approach. We can consider the number of possibilities of the number of wins that $B$ can have as a combination problem, and the number of possibilities of the number of games that $B$ can lose as a combination problem.\n\nTo calculate the probability of $B$ having less wins, we can use a complementary probability and the fact that there are $2^{5}$ total possibilities.\n\nAfter using these approaches, we can find the probability of $A$ having more wins than $B$ by subtracting the probability of $B$ having more wins from $1.$\n\nAfter finding this probability, we need to find the sum of the numerator and denominator of the probability in its simplest form.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n \n1. Let $n$ be the number of wins $A$ has. \n2. Let $k$ be the number of wins $B$ has. \n3. There are $2^{5}$ total possibilities of the five games involving $A.$ \n4. To calculate the probability of $B$ having more or equal wins, we can use the combination formula: $\\binom{n}{k}.$ \n5. To calculate the probability of $B$ having less wins, we can use a complementary probability: $1-\\dfrac{\\binom{n}{k}}{2^{5}}.$ \n6. We can calculate the probability of $A$ finishing with more points than $B$ by using the cases we defined earlier. \n7. To find the sum of the numerator and denominator of the probability in its simplest form, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{171}.$"
