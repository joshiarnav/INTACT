    "problem": "There are two distinguishable flagpoles, and there are $19$ flags, of which $10$ are identical blue flags, and $9$ are identical green flags. Let $N$ be the number of distinguishable arrangements using all of the flags in which each flagpole has at least one flag and no two green flags on either pole are adjacent. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n",
    "solution": "The well known problem of ordering $x$ elements of a string of $y$ elements such that none of the $x$ elements are next to each other has ${y-x+1\\choose x}$ solutions. (1)\nWe generalize for $a$ blues and $b$ greens. Consider a string of $a+b$ elements such that we want to choose the greens such that none of them are next to each other. We would also like to choose a place where we can divide this string into two strings such that the left one represents the first pole, and the right one represents the second pole, in order up the pole according to position on the string.\nHowever, this method does not account for the fact that the first pole could end with a green, and the second pole could start with a green, since the original string assumed that no greens could be consecutive. We solve this problem by introducing an extra blue, such that we choose our divider by choosing one of these $a+1$ blues, and not including that one as a flag on either pole.\nFrom (1), we now have ${a+2\\choose b}$ ways to order the string such that no greens are next to each other, and $a+1$ ways to choose the extra blue that will divide the string into the two poles: or $(a+1){a+2\\choose b}$ orderings in total.\nHowever, we have overcounted the solutions where either pole has no flags, we have to count these separately. This is the same as choosing our extra blue as one of the two ends, and ordering the other $a$ blues and $b$ greens such that no greens are next to each other: for a total of $2{a+1\\choose b}$ such orderings.\nThus, we have $(a+1){a+2\\choose b}-2{a+1\\choose b}$ orderings that satisfy the conditions in the problem: plugging in $a=10$ and $b=9$, we get $2310 \\equiv \\boxed{310} \\pmod{1000}$.",

    "model_solution": "To start solving this problem, let's first consider the total number of arrangements possible using all the flags. We can think of this as a string of 19 flags, where we have 10 identical blue flags and 9 identical green flags.\n\nSince we have identical flags, we can use the concept of combinations with repetition to find the total number of arrangements. However, we need to consider the fact that we have two distinguishable flagpoles and we want to ensure that each pole has at least one flag.\n\nThe first step is to place one blue flag on each pole. This will ensure that each pole has at least one flag. Now, we have 8 blue flags and 9 green flags left to arrange.\n\nWe can think of this as a string of 8 blue flags and 9 green flags, where we want to ensure that no two green flags are adjacent. We can use the concept of \"boxes\" to represent the blue flags and the green flags. The blue flags will serve as the boxes, and we can place the green flags in between the boxes or at the ends.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the green flags in between the boxes is given by the number of ways to choose 9 spots from 8 boxes and 1 \"box\" at the end, which is equivalent to ${10 \\choose 1} = 10$.\n\nNow, for each of these arrangements, we have 8! ways to arrange the blue flags and 9! ways to arrange the green flags.\n\nHowever, this is not correct, because we have double-counted the arrangements where the green flags are not adjacent. We need to subtract the number of arrangements where the green flags are adjacent.\n\nTo do this, we can think of the green flags as a single unit, and arrange the blue flags and the green unit together. We have 9 blue flags, 1 green unit, and 8 \"boxes\" to arrange.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange this is ${10 \\choose 1} = 10$. Now, we need to subtract the number of ways to arrange the green unit and the blue flags such that the green unit is adjacent to the blue flag, which is equivalent to ${9 \\choose 1} = 9$.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of arrangements where the green flags are not adjacent, which is $10 \\cdot 8! \\cdot 9! - 9 \\cdot 8! \\cdot 9! = 10 \\cdot 8! \\cdot 9!$.\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer, because we still need to account for the fact that we have two distinguishable flagpoles.\n\nTo do this, we can multiply the total number of arrangements by 2, which gives us $2 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 8! \\cdot 9! = 20 \\cdot 8! \\cdot 9!$.\n\nNow, we can find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000.\n\nThe remainder is $\\boxed{320}$"
