    "problem": "A mother purchases 5 blue plates, 2 red plates, 2 green plates, and 1 orange plate. How many ways are there for her to arrange these plates for dinner around her circular table if she doesn't want the 2 green plates to be adjacent?\n",
    "solution": "We apply the complement principle: we find the total number of cases in which the 2 green places are adjacent, and subtract from the total number of cases.\nThere are $\\frac{10!}{5!2!2!1!} = 7560$ ways to arrange the plates in a linear fashion. However, since the plates are arranged in a circle, there are $10$ ways to rotate the plates, and so there are $7560/10 = 756$ ways to arrange the plates in a circular fashion (consider, for example, fixing the orange plate at the top of the table).\nIf the two green plates are adjacent, we may think of them as a single entity, so that there are now $9$ objects to be placed around the table in a circular fashion. Using the same argument, there are $\\frac{9!}{5!2!1!1!} = 1512$ ways to arrange the objects in a linear fashion, and $1512/9 = 168$ ways in a circular fashion.\nThus, the answer is $756 - 168 = \\boxed{588}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total number of arrangements for the plates, we can use the formula for circular permutations with repeated items. \n\nFirst, let's find the total number of arrangements without the restriction that the 2 green plates cannot be adjacent. \n\nThe total number of plates is 5 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 10. \n\nThe formula for circular permutations with repeated items is (n-1)! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the number of repeated items.\n\nIn this case, we have 10 total plates, 5 blue plates, 2 red plates, 2 green plates, and 1 orange plate. \n\nSo, the number of arrangements without the restriction is (10-1)! / (5! * 2! * 2!)\n= 9! / (5! * 2! * 2!)\n= 362,880 / (120 * 2 * 2)\n= 362,880 / 480\n= 756\n\nNow, to find the number of arrangements where the 2 green plates are adjacent, we can consider the 2 green plates as a single item. \n\nThen, we have 9 total items: 5 blue plates, 2 red plates, 1 orange plate, and 1 \"green plate\".\n\nSo, the number of arrangements with the 2 green plates adjacent is (9-1)! / (5! * 2! * 1!)\n= 8! / (5! * 2!)\n= 40,320 / (120 * 2)\n= 40,320 / 240\n= 168\n\nNow, to find the number of arrangements where the 2 green plates are not adjacent, we subtract the number of arrangements where they are adjacent from the total number of arrangements.\n\nSo, the number of arrangements where the 2 green plates are not adjacent is 756 - 168\n= 588\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{588}$."
