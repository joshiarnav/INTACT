    "problem": "A paperboy delivers newspapers to 10 houses along Main Street. Wishing to save effort, he doesn't always deliver to every house, but to avoid being fired he never misses three consecutive houses. Compute the number of ways the paperboy could deliver papers in this manner.\n",
    "solution": "We can find a recursion. Let $D_n$ be the number of legal delivery sequences for $n$ houses. If a sequence ends with a delivery, we simply append one to $D_{n - 1}$. If it ends in $1$ nondelivery, we append a nondelivery and a delivery to $D_{n - 2}$. If it ends in $2$ nondeliveries, we append them and a delivery to $D_{n - 3}$. So\n$D_n = D_{n - 1} + D_{n - 2} + D_{n - 3}$.\nThus, since clearly $D_1 = 2$, $D_2 = 4$, $D_3 = 7$, we have $D_4 = 13$, $D_5 = 24$, $D_6 = 44$, $D_7 = 81$, $D_8 = 149$, $D_9 = 274$, $D_{10} = \\boxed{504}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step. \n\nLet $a_n$ be the number of ways to deliver papers to $n$ houses without missing three consecutive houses.\n\nWe can establish a recursive relation as follows:\n\n- If the paperboy delivers papers to the $n$th house, then he must have delivered papers to the $(n-1)$th house, so there are $a_{n-2}$ ways to deliver papers to the first $(n-1)$ houses.\n- If the paperboy doesn't deliver papers to the $n$th house, then he must have delivered papers to the $(n-1)$th house, so there are $a_{n-1}$ ways to deliver papers to the first $(n-1)$ houses.\n\nHowever, the above approach will overcount the cases where the paperboy doesn't deliver papers to both the $(n-1)$th and $n$th houses. To correct this, we need to subtract the cases where the paperboy doesn't deliver papers to both the $(n-1)$th and $n$th houses, and then delivers papers to the $(n-2)$th house. There are $a_{n-3}$ ways to deliver papers to the first $(n-3)$ houses.\n\nTherefore, the recursive relation is:\n\n$a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$\n\nNow, we need to find the initial conditions. \n\n- $a_1 = 2$ (deliver or not deliver)\n- $a_2 = 4$ (deliver-deliver, deliver-not deliver, not deliver-deliver, not deliver-not deliver)\n- $a_3 = 7$ (deliver-deliver-deliver, deliver-deliver-not deliver, deliver-not deliver-deliver, deliver-not deliver-not deliver, not deliver-deliver-deliver, not deliver-deliver-not deliver, not deliver-not deliver-deliver)\n\nNow, we can use the recursive relation to find $a_{10}$. \n\n$a_4 = a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = 7 + 4 + 2 = 13$\n$a_5 = a_4 + a_3 + a_2 = 13 + 7 + 4 = 24$\n$a_6 = a_5 + a_4 + a_3 = 24 + 13 + 7 = 44$\n$a_7 = a_6 + a_5 + a_4 = 44 + 24 + 13 = 81$\n$a_8 = a_7 + a_6 + a_5 = 81 + 44 + 24 = 149$\n$a_9 = a_8 + a_7 + a_6 = 149 + 81 + 44 = 274$\n$a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 + a_7 = 274 + 149 + 81 = \\boxed{504}$."
