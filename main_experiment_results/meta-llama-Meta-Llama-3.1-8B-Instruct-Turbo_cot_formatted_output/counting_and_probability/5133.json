    "problem": "How many 10-digit positive integers have all digits either 1 or 2, and have two consecutive 1's?\n",
    "solution": "We take as our universe the set of 10-digit integers whose digits are all either 1 or 2, of which there are $2^{10}$, and we count the complement. The complement is the set of 10-digit positive integers composed of the digits 1 and 2 with no two consecutive 1s. Counting such numbers is a popular combinatorial problem: we approach it via a recursion.\nThere are two \"good\" one-digit numbers (1 and 2) and three good two-digit numbers (12, 21 and 22). Each such $n$-digit number is formed either by gluing \"2\" on to the end of a good $(n - 1)$-digit number or by gluing \"21\" onto the end of a good $(n - 2)$-digit number. This is a bijection between the good $n$-digit numbers and the union of the good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. Thus, the number of good $n$-digit numbers is the sum of the number of good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. The resulting recursion is exactly that of the Fibonacci numbers with initial values $F_1 = 2$ and $F_2 = 3$.\nThus, our final answer is $2^{10} - F_{10} = 1024 - 144 = \\boxed{880}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2 and have two consecutive 1's, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Counting all possible 10-digit integers with digits 1 or 2:** Since each digit can be either 1 or 2, there are 2 possibilities for each digit. With 10 digits, the total number of 10-digit integers is $2^{10} = 1024$.\n\n2. **Finding the complement:** Instead of directly counting the 10-digit integers with two consecutive 1's, we can use the complement principle. This principle states that the number of desired outcomes (in this case, 10-digit integers with two consecutive 1's) is equal to the total number of outcomes (all 10-digit integers with digits 1 or 2) minus the number of undesired outcomes (10-digit integers without two consecutive 1's).\n\n3. **Counting 10-digit integers without two consecutive 1's:** To count the number of 10-digit integers without two consecutive 1's, we can use a recursive approach. Let $a_n$ be the number of $n$-digit integers without two consecutive 1's. We have two cases:\n    - The first digit can be 2, in which case there are $a_{n-1}$ possible $n$-digit integers.\n    - The first digit can be 1, in which case the second digit must be 2, and there are $a_{n-2}$ possible $n$-digit integers (since the remaining $n-2$ digits can have any combination of 1s and 2s).\n    Hence, we have the recurrence relation: \n    $$a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$$\n\n    We also have the initial conditions: $a_1 = 2$ (since a 1-digit integer can be either 1 or 2), and $a_2 = 3$ (since a 2-digit integer can be 22, 21, or 12).\n\n    Now, we can use this recurrence relation to find $a_{10}$.\n\n4. **Finding $a_{10}$ using the recurrence relation:**\n    - $a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 3 + 2 = 5$\n    - $a_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 5 + 3 = 8$\n    - $a_5 = a_4 + a_3 = 8 + 5 = 13$\n    - $a_6 = a_5 + a_4 = 13 + 8 = 21$\n    - $a_7 = a_6 + a_5 = 21 + 13 = 34$\n    - $a_8 = a_7 + a_6 = 34 + 21 = 55$\n    - $a_9 = a_8 + a_7 = 55 + 34 = 89$\n    - $a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 = 89 + 55 = 144$\n\n5. **Finding the number of 10-digit integers with two consecutive 1's:**\n    Now that we have $a_{10}$, the number of 10-digit integers without two consecutive 1's, we can find the number of 10-digit integers with two consecutive 1's by subtracting $a_{10}$ from the total number of 10-digit integers.\n\n    Hence, the number of 10-digit integers with two consecutive 1's is: \n    $2^{10} - a_{10} = 1024 - 144 = \\boxed{880}$"
