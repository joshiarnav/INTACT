    "problem": "License plates from different states follow different alpha-numeric formats, which dictate which characters of a plate must be letters and which must be numbers. Florida has license plates with an alpha-numeric format like the one pictured. North Dakota, on the other hand, has a different format, also pictured. Assuming all 10 digits are equally likely to appear in the numeric positions, and all 26 letters are equally likely to appear in the alpha positions, how many more license plates can Florida issue than North Dakota?

    "solution": "Florida issues license plates in which the first three and last slots are filled with letters, and the fourth and fifth are filled with digits. Thus, there are $26^4 \\cdot 10^2$ Florida license plates possible. North Dakota, however, issues license plates in which the first three slots are filled with letters and the last three slots are filled with digits. There are thus $26^3 \\cdot 10^3$ possible North Dakota license plates. Multiplying these out and taking the difference yields an answer of $\\boxed{28121600}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of license plates each state can issue, we need to calculate the number of possibilities for each character position.\n\nFor Florida, the format is three letters, followed by two numbers, and then a letter. There are 26 possibilities for each of the three letter positions, and 10 possibilities for each of the two number positions. There are 26 possibilities for the final letter position. Therefore, the total number of license plates Florida can issue is $26^4 \\times 10^2$.\n\nFor North Dakota, the format is three letters, followed by three numbers. There are 26 possibilities for each of the three letter positions, and 10 possibilities for each of the three number positions. Therefore, the total number of license plates North Dakota can issue is $26^3 \\times 10^3$.\n\nTo find the difference in the number of license plates the two states can issue, we subtract the number of license plates North Dakota can issue from the number of license plates Florida can issue:\n\n$26^4 \\times 10^2 - (26^3 \\times 10^3)$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$26^4 \\times 10^2 - 26^3 \\times 10^3 = 26^3 \\times 26 \\times 10^2 - 26^3 \\times 10^3$\n\n$= 26^3 \\times 10^2 \\times (26 - 10)$\n\n$= 26^3 \\times 10^2 \\times 16$\n\n$= 26^3 \\times 160 \\times 10^2$\n\n$= 26^3 \\times 160000$\n\n$= 17576000 \\times 160$\n\n$= 2812160000$\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{2812160000}$."
