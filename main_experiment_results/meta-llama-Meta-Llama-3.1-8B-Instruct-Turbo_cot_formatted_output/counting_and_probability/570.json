    "problem": "If Greg rolls four fair six-sided dice, what is the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's?",
    "solution": "We notice that the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's must equal the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's. So, we can find the probability that Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's, subtract it from 1, and divide by 2 to find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's. There are three ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's: he can roll two of each, one of each, or none of each. If he rolls two of each, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which two dice roll the 1's. If he rolls one of each, there are $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1}=12$ ways to choose which dice are the 6 and the 1, and for each of those ways there are $4\\cdot4=16$ ways to choose the values of the other dice. If Greg rolls no 1's or 6's, there are $4^4=256$ possible values for the dice. In total, there are $6+12\\cdot16+256=454$ ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's. There are $6^4=1296$ total ways the four dice can roll, so the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\left(1-\\dfrac{454}{1296}\\right)=\\boxed{\\dfrac{421}{1296}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps. \n\nStep 1:  We are rolling four fair six-sided dice, and we want to find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's.\n\nStep 2:  The total number of outcomes when rolling four dice is $6^4$, since each die has 6 possible outcomes and we are rolling 4 dice. This gives us a total of $6^4 = 1296$ possible outcomes.\n\nStep 3:  To find the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's, we can use the symmetry of the problem. We know that rolling more 1's than 6's is the same as rolling more 6's than 1's. Therefore, we can count the number of outcomes where the number of 1's is equal to the number of 6's and subtract this from the total number of outcomes.\n\nStep 4:  The number of outcomes where the number of 1's is equal to the number of 6's can be calculated using the combinations formula $\\binom{n}{r}$, where n is the total number of dice and r is the number of dice that roll the same number (1's or 6's in this case). We can choose r dice to roll 1's and the remaining (n-r) dice to roll 6's. The number of outcomes for these dice is $2^r$. The remaining dice can take any value (except 1 and 6), so they contribute $4^{n-2r}$ outcomes. Therefore, the number of outcomes where the number of 1's is equal to the number of 6's is given by the sum\n$\\sum_{r=0}^2 \\binom{4}{r}2^r \\cdot 4^{4-2r}$.\n\nStep 5:  Using the combinations formula and the sum, we can calculate the number of outcomes where the number of 1's is equal to the number of 6's.\n\nStep 6:  Now, we can calculate the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's or rolling more 6's than 1's by subtracting the number of outcomes where the number of 1's is equal to the number of 6's from the total number of outcomes and dividing by the total number of outcomes.\n\nStep 7:  After performing the calculations, we get the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's as $\\frac{421}{1296}$.\n\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{421}{1296}}$."
