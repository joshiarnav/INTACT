    "problem": "An integer greater than 9 and less than 100 is randomly chosen. What is the probability that its digits are different?",
    "solution": "We calculate the probability that the digits are the same, and subtract from 1. From the 90 integers to be chosen from, only 9 have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, ..., 99. Therefore, the probability that the digits are the same is $\\frac{9}{90} = \\frac{1}{10}$, so the probability that the digits are different is $1-\\frac{1}{10}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of integers between 9 and 100. \n\nThe smallest two-digit number is 10 and the largest two-digit number is 99. So, the total number of integers is 99 - 10 + 1 = 90.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of integers with the same digits (i.e., 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99). There are 9 such numbers.\n\nSo, the number of integers with different digits is 90 - 9 = 81.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that the digits of the chosen integer are different. Probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. \n\nProbability = (number of integers with different digits) / (total number of integers)\nProbability = 81 / 90\nProbability = 9 / 10\n\nSo, the probability that the digits of the chosen integer are different is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$."
