    "problem": "If I have a $4\\times 4$ chess board, in how many ways can I place four distinct pawns on the board such that each column and row of the board contains no more than one pawn?",
    "solution": "Because our chess board is $4 \\times 4$, there must be exactly one pawn in each column and each row. Consider the ways to place one pawn in each row. In the first row, there are four potential spots for a pawn. However, no matter where we place the pawn, it takes up one column. So, in the second row, there are only three potential spots for a pawn. Similarly, there are two spots in the third row and only one in the fourth. Thus, there are $4\\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 24$ ways in which we can place the pawns. Now, because each pawn is distinct, we have four possible pawns to place in the first slot, three in the second, two in the fourth, and one in the last. So there are $24$ possible orderings of the pawns. Our final answer is thus $24^2 = \\boxed{576}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's think step by step.\n\nStep 1: We have a 4x4 chessboard, and we need to place four distinct pawns on it. \n\nStep 2: To ensure that each column and row of the board contains no more than one pawn, we can start by placing the first pawn. There are 16 possible squares on the board where we can place the first pawn.\n\nStep 3: After placing the first pawn, we have 9 possible squares left for the second pawn. This is because we need to exclude the row and column of the first pawn, which leaves us with a 3x3 sub-grid. We can place the second pawn in any of the 9 remaining squares.\n\nStep 4: After placing the first two pawns, we have 4 possible squares left for the third pawn. This is because we need to exclude the rows and columns of the first two pawns, which leaves us with a 2x2 sub-grid. We can place the third pawn in any of the 4 remaining squares.\n\nStep 5: After placing the first three pawns, we have only one possible square left for the fourth pawn. This is because we need to exclude the rows and columns of the first three pawns, which leaves us with a 1x1 sub-grid.\n\nStep 6: Now, we can multiply the number of possibilities at each step to find the total number of ways to place the four distinct pawns on the board.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to place the four distinct pawns on the board is:\n\n16 (for the first pawn) \u00d7 9 (for the second pawn) \u00d7 4 (for the third pawn) \u00d7 1 (for the fourth pawn) = 576\n\nHowever, we must remember that each pawn has a distinct identity, and the order in which we place them matters. Therefore, we need to multiply the result by 4! (4 factorial) to account for the permutations of the four distinct pawns.\n\n4! = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24\n\nNow, we multiply the result by 24:\n\n576 \u00d7 24 = 13824\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{13824}$"
