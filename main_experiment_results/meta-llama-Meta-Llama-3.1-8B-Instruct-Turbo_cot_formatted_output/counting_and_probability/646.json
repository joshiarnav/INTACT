    "problem": "A Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans. Assuming all politicians are distinguishable, in how many ways can they sit around a circular table without restrictions?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "There are 10 people to place, so we can place them in $10!$ ways, but this counts each valid arrangement 10 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement).  So the number of ways to seat them is $\\dfrac{10!}{10} = 9! = \\boxed{362,\\!880}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total number of ways the 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans can sit around a circular table without restrictions, we can first consider arranging them in a line.\n\nThere are 10! (10 factorial) ways to arrange them in a line. This is because for the first seat, there are 10 choices, for the second seat, there are 9 choices left, and so on.\n\nNow, we need to account for the fact that the table is circular. In a circular table, if we rotate the arrangement, it is considered the same.\n\nFor example, if we have the arrangement ABCDEFGHIJ, rotating it by one person to get the arrangement BCDEFGHIJA is still considered the same arrangement.\n\nTo account for this, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of possible rotations. In a circular table with n people, there are 10 possible rotations (rotating by 1 person, 2 people, 3 people, ..., 10 people).\n\nHowever, in this case, since we have 10 people, we need to divide by 10. But we are actually dividing by the number of possible rotations that are distinct. So if we have the arrangement ABCDEFGHIJ, rotating it by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 people, these are all distinct.\n\nHowever, the number of rotations is actually equal to the number of people. And since the number of people is 10, this means we can divide the total number of linear arrangements by the number of possible rotations (10). \n\nBut we can also consider this in a different way. We can fix one person in one seat and arrange the other 9 people around the table. The number of ways to arrange the other 9 people is 9!. Now if we consider all 10 people, the number of arrangements is 10!.\n\nHowever, these arrangements are counted 10 times because the 10th person can be fixed in 10 different seats and the same arrangement is counted 10 times.\n\nSo, to get the actual number of distinct circular arrangements, we can divide the total number of linear arrangements by the number of rotations and also divide by 10 to get rid of the extra counting.\n\nBut, we can simply do 10! / 10 = 9!.\n\nHowever, dividing by 10 in the denominator gives us (10 - 1)! which is also equivalent to 9!.\n\nSo the correct answer is $\\boxed{3628800}$."
