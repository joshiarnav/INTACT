    "problem": "Crestview's school colors are purple and gold. The students are designing a flag using three solid-colored horizontal stripes, as shown. Using one or both of the school colors, how many different flags are possible if adjacent stripes may be the same color?\n\n[asy]\nsize(75);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,12));\ndot((0,12));\ndraw((0,12)--(8,12)--(8,11)--(0,11));\ndraw((8,11)--(8,9)--(0,9));\ndraw((8,9)--(8,6)--(0,6));\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "There are two possible colors for the first stripe, two possible colors for the second stripe, and two possible colors for the third stripe. Since the colors of each stripe are mutually exclusive, there are $2\\times 2 \\times 2 = \\boxed{8}$ ways to color the flag.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of possible different flags, we will analyze each stripe separately since they are all different. \n\nFor the top stripe, there are 2 options since it can be either purple or gold. \n\nFor the middle stripe, there are also 2 options since it can be either purple or gold. \n\nFor the bottom stripe, there are 2 options as well since it can be either purple or gold.\n\nSince the options for each stripe are independent of the others, we multiply the number of options for each stripe to find the total number of possible different flags. \n\nTherefore, the number of possible different flags is: \n$2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{8}$."
