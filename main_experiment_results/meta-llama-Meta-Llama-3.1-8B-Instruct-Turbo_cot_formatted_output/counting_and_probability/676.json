    "problem": "I have 10 distinguishable socks in my drawer: 4 white, 4 brown, and 2 blue.  In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of the same color?",
    "solution": "The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue.  If the socks are white, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are brown, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are blue, there is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ choice.  So the total number of choices for socks is $6 + 6 + 1 = \\boxed{13}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color, we need to consider each color separately and then add the results together.\n\n1. For the white socks: We have 4 white socks, and we need to choose 2 of them. This can be done in $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$ ways.\n\n2. For the brown socks: Similarly, we have 4 brown socks, and we need to choose 2 of them. This can be done in $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$ ways.\n\n3. For the blue socks: We have 2 blue socks, and we need to choose 2 of them. This can be done in $\\binom{2}{2} = \\frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1$ way.\n\nNow, let's add the results together: $6 + 6 + 1 = 13$ ways.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color is $\\boxed{13}$."
