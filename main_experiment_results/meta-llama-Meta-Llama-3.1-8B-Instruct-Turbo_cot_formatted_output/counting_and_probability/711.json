    "solution": "Since there are twelve steps between $(0,0)$ and $(5,7)$, $A$ and $B$ can meet only after they have each moved six steps. The possible meeting places are $P_{0} = (0,6)$, $P_{1} = (1,5)$, $P_{2} = (2,4)$, $P_{3}=(3,3)$, $P_{4} = (4,2)$, and $P_{5} =\n(5,1)$. Let $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ denote the number of paths to $P_{i}$ from $(0,0)$ and $(5,7)$, respectively. Since $A$ has to take $i$ steps to the right and $B$ has to take $i+1$ steps down, the number of ways in which $A$ and $B$ can meet at $P_{i}$ is $$a_{i}\\cdot b_{i} = \\binom{6}{i} \\binom{6}{i+1}. $$Since $A$ and $B$ can each take $2^{6}$ paths in six steps, the probability that they meet  is \\begin{align*}\n&\\sum_{i = 0}^{5}\\displaystyle\\left ( \\frac{a_{i}}{2^{6}}\\displaystyle\\right)\\displaystyle\\left( \\frac{b_{i}}{2^{6}} \\displaystyle\\right) \\\\\n& \\qquad = \\frac{\\binom{6}{0}\\binom{6}{1} + \\binom{6}{1}\\binom{6}{2} + \\binom{6}{2}\\binom{6}{3}\n+ \\binom{6}{3}\\binom{6}{4}+ \\binom{6}{4}\\binom{6}{5} + \\binom{6}{5}\\binom{6}{6}}{2^{12}}\\\\\n& \\qquad = \\frac{99}{512} \\\\\n& \\qquad \\approx \\boxed{0.20}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible paths that objects $A$ and $B$ can take to meet. Since each step is either right or up for object $A$ and left or down for object $B$, the total number of steps for both objects must be equal to the distance between their starting points, which is 12.\n\nLet's denote the number of steps object $A$ takes to the right as $x$ and the number of steps it takes upwards as $y$. Then, the number of steps object $B$ takes to the left is $5-x$ and the number of steps it takes downwards is $7-y$.\n\nSince the total number of steps for both objects must be 12, we have:\n\n$x + y = 12$\n\nAlso, the total number of steps for object $B$ must be 12, so we have:\n\n$(5-x) + (7-y) = 12$\n\nSimplifying the second equation, we get:\n\n$12 - x - y = 12$\n\n$-x - y = 0$\n\n$x + y = 12$ (which is the same as the first equation)\n\nSo, any combination of $x$ and $y$ that satisfies the first equation will result in object $A$ and object $B$ meeting.\n\nTo calculate the probability that the objects meet, we need to consider all possible paths that object $A$ can take to meet object $B$.\n\nEach path is a sequence of 12 steps for object $A$, where each step is either right or up. This is equivalent to choosing 12 steps out of the total 12 steps, where 2 of the steps are chosen as \"up\" or \"right\" (whichever is chosen first). The probability of each path is $(\\frac{1}{2})^{12}$, since each step is equally likely to be right or up.\n\nHowever, we are not counting all possible paths. We are only interested in the paths that result in object $A$ and object $B$ meeting.\n\nWe can count the number of paths by considering the possible values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation:\n\n$x + y = 12$\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are both non-negative integers, we have:\n\n$12 \\ge x \\ge 0$\n\n$12 \\ge y \\ge 0$\n\nAlso, since the objects must meet, the number of steps object $A$ takes to the right must be less than or equal to 5, and the number of steps object $A$ takes upwards must be less than or equal to 7.\n\nWe can count the number of paths by considering the lattice points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $x + y = 12$.\n\nWe can draw a lattice and count the number of lattice points that satisfy the equation. There are 13 lattice points that satisfy the equation:\n\n(0, 12), (1, 11), (2, 10), (3, 9), (4, 8), (5, 7), (6, 6), (7, 5), (8, 4), (9, 3), (10, 2), (11, 1), (12, 0)\n\nHowever, not all of these lattice points satisfy the condition that the objects meet. The objects will meet if and only if $x \\le 5$ and $y \\le 7$.\n\nThere are 6 lattice points that satisfy the condition:\n\n(0, 12), (1, 11), (2, 10), (3, 9), (4, 8), (5, 7)\n\nThe number of paths that result in object $A$ and object $B$ meeting is equal to the number of lattice points that satisfy the condition.\n\nEach path has a probability of $(\\frac{1}{2})^{12}$, since each step is equally likely to be right or up.\n\nSo, the probability that the objects meet is:\n\n$\\frac{6}{2^{12}} = \\frac{3}{2^{11}}$\n\n$\\frac{3}{2^{11}} = \\frac{3}{2048} \\approx 0.00146328125$\n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices. We need to multiply this probability by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n$0.00146328125 \\times 100 = 0.146328125%$\n\nHowever, we are asked for the answer choice that is closest to the probability. We need to round the probability to 2 decimal places.\n\n$0.146328125% \\approx 0.15%$\n\nSo, the answer choice that is closest to the probability is B.\n\n$\\boxed{B}$"
