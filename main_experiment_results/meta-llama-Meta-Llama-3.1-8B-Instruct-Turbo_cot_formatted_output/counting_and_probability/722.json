    "problem": "Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace?",
    "solution": "We have two cases because if the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$, it could be an ace or not be an ace.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{3}{51} = \\dfrac{1}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the three remaining aces, which gives a probability of $\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot \\dfrac{1}{17} = \\dfrac{1}{884}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{12}{52} = \\dfrac{3}{13}$ chance that a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the ace is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{4}{51}$ chance that an ace is drawn second, giving a $\\dfrac{3}{13}\\cdot \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{4}{221}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nSo the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\\dfrac{1}{884} + \\dfrac{4}{221} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}$.\n\nNotice that we can avoid some of the large denominators above by organizing this computation as follows: $$\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{3}{51}+\\dfrac{12}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{1\\cdot 3+12\\cdot 4}{52\\cdot 51} = \\dfrac{51}{52\\cdot 51}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}.$$",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace, we need to break it down into two steps.\n\n**Step 1:** Probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$.\n\nThere are 52 cards in total, and 13 of them are $\\diamondsuit$. So, the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ is $\\frac{13}{52}$ or $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n**Step 2:** Probability that the second card is an ace, given that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$.\n\nIf the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$, there are 51 cards left in the deck. There are 4 aces in the deck, but one of them has already been drawn. So, there are 3 aces left in the deck.\n\nThe probability that the second card is an ace is $\\frac{3}{51}$ or $\\frac{1}{17}$.\n\n**Combining the probabilities:**\n\nSince these are two dependent events (the second event depends on the outcome of the first event), we need to multiply the probabilities.\n\nProbability = $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{17} = \\frac{1}{68}$.\n\nSo, the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{68}}$."
