    "problem": "Seven people arrive to dinner, but the circular table only seats six.  If two seatings such that one is a rotation of the other are considered the same, then in how many different ways can we choose six people and seat them at the table?",
    "solution": "There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing.  To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person.  This suggests that there are $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people.  However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count.  Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table.  There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Choose 6 people out of 7. This can be done in $\\binom{7}{6}$ ways, which equals 7.\n\nStep 2: Arrange the chosen 6 people in a circular manner. Since the table is circular, we need to consider the rotational symmetries. \n\nIf we fix one person's position, then the remaining 5 people can be arranged in 5! ways around the table.\n\nHowever, since the table is circular, this arrangement is counted 6 times (once for each rotation of the table), so we need to divide by 6 to avoid overcounting.\n\nThis gives us a total of $\\frac{5!}{6} = \\frac{120}{6} = 20$ ways to arrange the people in a circular manner.\n\nStep 3: Combine the results from step 1 and step 2. Since there are 7 ways to choose 6 people and 20 ways to arrange them around the table, the total number of ways to choose 6 people and seat them at the table is $7 \\cdot 20 = 140$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{140}$."
