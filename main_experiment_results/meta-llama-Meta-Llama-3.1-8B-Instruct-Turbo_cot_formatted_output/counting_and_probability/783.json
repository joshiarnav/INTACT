    "problem": "Jane and her brother each spin this spinner once. The spinner has five congruent sectors. If the non-negative difference of their numbers is less than 3, Jane wins. Otherwise, her brother wins. What is the probability that Jane wins?

    "solution": "We consider the unordered pairs, or sets, of spins for which the difference of the numbers are greater than or equal to 3, or those games which Jane loses. These can only occur in the sets $\\{1, 4\\}$, $\\{1, 5 \\}$ or $\\{ 2, 5 \\}$. Each of these unordered pairs can occur in 2 orderings (depending on whether Jane or her brother spins each number). So, there are $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ losing combinations out of $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ for Jane. So, her winning probability is $1 - \\frac{6}{25} = \\boxed{\\frac{19}{25}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that Jane wins, we need to find the total number of outcomes and the number of outcomes where the non-negative difference of their numbers is less than 3.\n\nThere are 5 possible numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and each of them can be chosen by Jane and her brother. Therefore, there are $5 \\times 5 = 25$ total possible outcomes.\n\nFor Jane to win, the following conditions must be met:\n- If Jane and her brother get the same number, the difference is 0, so Jane wins.\n- If Jane gets a number that is 1 or 2 more than her brother's number, Jane wins.\n\nWe can list the winning outcomes as follows:\n\n- When Jane and her brother get the same number: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5). There are 5 winning outcomes in this case.\n- When Jane gets a number that is 1 more than her brother's number: (1,0) is not a valid outcome because 0 is not in the spinner; however (2,1), (3,2), (4,3), (5,4) are valid outcomes. There are 4 winning outcomes in this case.\n- When Jane gets a number that is 2 more than her brother's number: (2,0) is not a valid outcome because 0 is not in the spinner; however (3,1), (4,2), (5,3) are valid outcomes. There are 3 winning outcomes in this case.\n\nHowever, there are some cases that are counted twice. This includes (3,1), and (4,1), (5,1), (2,0) is not a valid outcome but (3,1) is valid so we will only count (3,1) once. And (4,2), (5,2), (3,1) are valid so we will only count (4,2) and (5,2) once. Therefore we only count these cases once. \n\nSo the total number of winning outcomes is 5 + 4 + 3 - 3 - 2 - 1 = 6.\n\nThe probability that Jane wins is the ratio of the number of winning outcomes to the total number of outcomes, which is $\\frac{6}{25}$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{6}{25}}$."
