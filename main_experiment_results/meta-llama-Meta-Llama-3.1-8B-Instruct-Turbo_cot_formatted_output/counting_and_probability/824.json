    "problem": "I have a drawer with 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives in it. If I reach in and randomly remove three pieces of silverware, what is the probability that I get one fork, one spoon, and one knife?",
    "solution": "First, we can find the denominator of our fraction.  There are a total of $\\dbinom{18}{3}=816$ ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware out of 18.  To find the numerator, we need to count the number of ways to choose one piece of each type of silverware.  There are 6 ways we could choose a fork, 6 ways to choose a spoon, and 6 ways to choose a knife, making a total of $6\\cdot 6 \\cdot 6=216$ ways to choose a fork, a knife, and a spoon so our final probability is $\\frac{216}{816}=\\boxed{\\frac{9}{34}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability of getting one fork, one spoon, and one knife, we'll use the concept of combinations. \n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware from the 18 (6 forks + 6 spoons + 6 knives). This is a combination problem, so we use the formula: \n\n\\[ \\text{Total combinations} = \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\n\nwhere $n$ is the total number of items and $k$ is the number of items chosen. In this case, $n = 18$ and $k = 3$. \n\n\\[ \\text{Total combinations} = \\binom{18}{3} = \\frac{18!}{3!(18-3)!} = \\frac{18!}{3!15!} = 816 \\]\n\nSo, there are 816 possible combinations of choosing 3 pieces of silverware.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife. We can choose one fork from 6 forks in $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways, one spoon from 6 spoons in $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways, and one knife from 6 knives in $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways. \n\nUsing the multiplication rule, the total number of ways to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife is: \n\n\\[ \\text{Number of favorable outcomes} = \\binom{6}{1} \\times \\binom{6}{1} \\times \\binom{6}{1} = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216 \\]\n\nFinally, the probability of getting one fork, one spoon, and one knife is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total combinations}} = \\frac{216}{816} = \\frac{27}{102} = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{34}} \\]"
