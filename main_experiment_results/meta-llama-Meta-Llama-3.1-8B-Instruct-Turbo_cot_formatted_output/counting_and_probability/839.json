    "problem": "Define a $\\it{good\\ word}$ as a sequence of letters that consists only of the letters $A$, $B$, and $C$ --- some of these letters may not appear in the sequence --- and in which $A$ is never immediately followed by $B$, $B$ is never immediately followed by $C$, and $C$ is never immediately followed by $A$. How many seven-letter good words are there?",
    "solution": "There are three choices for the first letter and two choices for each subsequent letter, so there are $3\\cdot2^{n-1}\\ n$-letter good words.  Substitute $n=7$ to find there are $3\\cdot2^6=\\boxed{192}$ seven-letter good words.",

    "model_solution": "To count the number of seven-letter good words, we can use a recursive approach.\n\nThe first letter can be any of A, B, or C, so there are 3 possibilities for the first letter.\n\nFor the second letter, we need to consider the case based on the first letter. If the first letter is A, then the second letter can be either A or C. If the first letter is B, then the second letter can be either A or B. If the first letter is C, then the second letter can be either B or C.\n\n- If the first letter is A, then there are 2 possibilities for the second letter.\n- If the first letter is B, then there are 2 possibilities for the second letter.\n- If the first letter is C, then there are 2 possibilities for the second letter.\n\nThe same logic applies to the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh letters. Each letter depends on the previous one.\n\nLet's denote the number of $n$-letter good words as $a_n$. \n\n- $a_1 = 3$ (3 possibilities for the first letter)\n- $a_2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7$ (for the first letter, we have 3 possibilities; for the second letter, we have 3 possibilities, but 1 of them is excluded for each of the first 3 possibilities)\n- $a_3 = 3 + 2 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 2 + 2 = 11$ (for the first letter, we have 3 possibilities; for the second letter, we have 2 possibilities for each of the first 2 possibilities; for the third letter, we have 2 possibilities for the first 2 possibilities)\n- $a_4 = 3 + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 2 = 15$ (for the first letter, we have 3 possibilities; for the second letter, we have 2 possibilities for each of the first 2 possibilities; for the third letter, we have 2 possibilities for each of the first 2 possibilities; for the fourth letter, we have 2 possibilities for the first 2 possibilities)\n- $a_5 = 3 + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 21$\n- $a_6 = 3 + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 29$\n- $a_7 = 3 + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 41$\n\nTherefore, the number of seven-letter good words is $a_7 = \\boxed{41}$."
