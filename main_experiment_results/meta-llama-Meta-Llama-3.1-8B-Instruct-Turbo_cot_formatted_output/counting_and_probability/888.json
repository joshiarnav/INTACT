    "solution": "Clearly one color isn't enough; $\\boxed{2}$ colors will work because the tessellation shown is topologically identical to a chessboard (that is, imagine straightening out the diagonal lines to form an array of squares. This process doesn't change which tiles share a side.).",

    "model_solution": "To find the least number of colors needed to shade the given tessellation, let's analyze the pattern and see if we can identify any repeating motifs or structures.\n\nThe given tessellation consists of hexagonal tiles arranged in a repeating pattern. Each tile shares sides with six neighboring tiles. The key observation here is that we can divide the tessellation into two interlocking sets of tiles, such that tiles in the same set do not share sides.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by alternating the orientation of the tiles, creating a chessboard-like pattern. When we do this, we can see that each tile is surrounded by six tiles in the other set.\n\nGiven this arrangement, we can color the tiles in one set with one color and the tiles in the other set with a different color. This way, no two tiles sharing a side will be the same color.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the least number of colors needed to shade the given tessellation is $\\boxed{2}$."
