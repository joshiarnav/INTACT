    "problem": "If I roll 5 standard 6-sided dice and multiply the number on the face of each die, what is the probability that the result is a composite number?",
    "solution": "While it is almost tempting to make this into the casework problem to end all casework problems, using complementary probability makes the problem a lot simpler, so we will find the probability that the product is not composite.\n\nIt's clear that if more than one die shows a roll greater than 1, the resulting product will have more than one factor that is greater than 1 and therefore be composite. Additionally, if any of the dice show a 4 or a 6, the product will obviously be composite. So in order for the product to not be composite, we need at least four dice to be a 1 and the fifth die to either be another 1 or a 2, a 3, or a 5.\n\nThere's exactly one way in which all the the dice can be 1's, and for each of the other three cases there are 5 ways since the die that isn't a 1 can appear in any of the 5 other positions, so there are a total of $3\\cdot5+1=16$ ways of rolling the dice that result in a product that isn't composite. Additionally, there are 6 options for the roll of each of the 5 dice for a total of $6^5=7776$ possible outcomes, which means that the probability of the product not being composite is $\\dfrac{16}{7776}$ and the probability that it is composite is $1-\\frac{16}{7776}=\\frac{7760}{7776}=\\boxed{\\frac{485}{486}}$.\n\nNote: Many students have tried to argue that 1 is not a prime number and should not be counted. As we are doing complementary probability, it is important to consider all numbers that are not composite, and 1 is definitely not composite.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the product is a composite number, it's easier to find the probability that it's not a composite number and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThere are a few ways the product can't be a composite number:\n\n1. At least 4 dice show a 1, and the remaining die shows a prime number (2, 3, or 5).\n\nLet's calculate the number of ways to get this:\n\n- There are 3 choices for the non-1 die (2, 3, or 5) and 5 choices for where it is (in 5 different positions).\n- There are $\\binom{5}{4} = 5$ ways to choose which 4 dice show a 1.\n\nSo, the number of ways to get this case is: $3 \\cdot 5 = 15$.\n\n2. At least 5 dice show a 1.\n\nThere are 5 ways to get this case, as all the dice must be 1.\n\nIn total, there are $15 + 5 = 20$ ways where the product is not a composite number.\n\nThere are $6^5 = 7776$ total ways to roll 5 dice.\n\nSo, the probability that the product is not a composite number is: $\\frac{20}{7776}$.\n\nThe probability that the product is a composite number is: $1 - \\frac{20}{7776}$.\n\nTo simplify this, we can find a common denominator, which is 7776. Then we get:\n\n$1 = \\frac{7776}{7776}$\n\n$\\frac{20}{7776} = \\frac{20}{7776}$\n\n$1 - \\frac{20}{7776} = \\frac{7776}{7776} - \\frac{20}{7776} = \\frac{7756}{7776}$\n\nSo, the probability that the product is a composite number is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7756}{7776}}$"
