    "problem": "When two fair 6-sided dice are tossed, the numbers $a$ and $b$ are obtained. What is the probability that the two digit number $ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) and $a$ and $b$ are all divisible by 3?",
    "solution": "$ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) is divisible by 3 only when $a+b$ is divisible by 3. Since 3 divides both $a$ and $a+b$, 3 must divide $b$. Therefore, $a$ and $b$ can equal 3 or 6. The probability that $a$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. The probability that $b$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. Therefore, The probability that both $a$ and $b$ equal 3 or 6 is $\\left(\\frac13\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac19}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the two-digit number $ab$ and $a$ and $b$ are all divisible by 3, we need to consider the possible combinations of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy this condition.\n\nSince each die has 6 possible outcomes, there are a total of $6 \\times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes when two dice are tossed.\n\nFor $a$ and $b$ to be divisible by 3, the possible values for each are 3 and 6. \n\nSo, we need to count the number of combinations where both $a$ and $b$ are either 3 or 6.\n\n- If $a=3$, then $b$ can be 3 or 6, which gives us 2 possibilities.\n- If $a=6$, then $b$ can be 3 or 6, which gives us 2 possibilities.\n- If $b=3$, then $a$ can be 3 or 6, which gives us 2 possibilities.\n- If $b=6$, then $a$ can be 3 or 6, which gives us 2 possibilities.\n\nHowever, we counted some of these possibilities twice. Specifically, we counted the possibilities $(a=3, b=3)$ and $(a=3, b=3)$ as two separate possibilities, when in fact they are the same.\n\nTherefore, we only need to count each possibility once. This gives us a total of $2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8$ possible combinations where both $a$ and $b$ are either 3 or 6.\n\nNow, we need to consider the two-digit number $ab$. For $ab$ to be divisible by 3, the sum of $a$ and $b$ must be divisible by 3.\n\nThe possible combinations of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy this condition are:\n\n- $(a=3, b=3)$, $(a=3, b=6)$, $(a=6, b=3)$, $(a=6, b=6)$\n\nThese four possibilities are the only ones that satisfy the condition that $ab$ is divisible by 3.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the two-digit number $ab$ and $a$ and $b$ are all divisible by 3 is $\\frac{4}{36} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$."
