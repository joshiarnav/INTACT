    "model_solution": "To find the number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set, we need to consider the largest possible difference and the smallest possible difference.\n\nThe largest difference occurs when we subtract the smallest number in the set (1) from the largest number in the set (16), which is 16 - 1 = 15.\n\nThe smallest difference occurs when we subtract two consecutive numbers in the set, such as 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nNow, let's consider all the possible differences. The largest possible difference is 15, and the smallest possible difference is 1. \n\nThe possible differences can be obtained by subtracting consecutive numbers: 1, 2, 3, ..., 14, 15. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1.\n\nTo find the number of terms in this arithmetic sequence, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term, n is the number of terms, and d is the common difference.\n\nWe know that the first term is 1, the last term is 15, and the common difference is 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n15 = 1 + (n-1)1\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n14 = n - 1\n\nAdding 1 to both sides, we get:\n\nn = 15\n\nTherefore, there are 15 possible differences in the set.\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the 0 difference, as the problem asks for positive integers. The 0 difference is obtained when we subtract a number from itself, which is not allowed in the problem.\n\nSo, the final answer is 14.\n\n$\\boxed{14}$"
