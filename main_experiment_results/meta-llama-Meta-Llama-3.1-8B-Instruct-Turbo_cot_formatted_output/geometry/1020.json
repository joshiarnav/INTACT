    "problem": "In a trapezoid $ABCD$ with $AB$ parallel to $CD$, the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$. If the area of triangle $ABE$ is 50 square units, and the area of triangle $ADE$ is 20 square units, what is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?",
    "solution": "[asy]\nsize(2.5inch);\npair A,B,C,D,E;\nA = (-3,4);\nB = (5,4);\nC = (4,0);\nD = (0,0);\nE = intersectionpoint(A--C, B--D);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle); draw(A--C); draw(B--D);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW); label(\"$B$\", B, NE); label(\"$C$\", C, SE); label(\"$D$\", D, SW); label(\"$E$\", E, N);\n[/asy] We will write the area of triangle $XYZ$ as $[XYZ].$  Since triangles $ADC$ and $BCD$ share a base and have the same altitude length to that base, they have the same area. Since $[BCD] = [ADC]$, we have $[BCE] + [CDE] = [ADE] + [CDE]$, so  $[BCE] = [ADE] = 20$.\n\nTo find the area of triangle $CDE$, we note that triangles $CDE$ and $ABE$ are similar, and the ratio of their sides is $DE/BE$. Triangles $ADE$ and $ABE$ share an altitude, so $DE/BE = [ADE]/[ABE] = 20/50 = 2/5$. Since the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their sides, $[CDE]/[ABE] = (DE/BE)^2 = 4/25$, and $[CDE] = (4/25)[ABE] = (4/25)(50) = 8$. Thus, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $[ABE] + [ADE] + [BCE] + [CDE] = 50+20+20+8 = \\boxed{98}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of trapezoid $ABCD$, we can use the fact that the ratio of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ is equal to the ratio of the bases $AB$ and $DC$. \n\nSince the height of both triangles is the same (the distance between the parallel bases), the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of their bases. Given that the area of triangle $ABE$ is 50 square units and the area of triangle $ADE$ is 20 square units, the ratio of their areas is $\\frac{50}{20} = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nLet's denote the length of base $AB$ as $x$ and the length of base $DC$ as $y$. The ratio $\\frac{x}{y}$ is equal to the ratio $\\frac{5}{2}$. Therefore, we have $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nWe can also use the fact that the area of triangle $ABC$ is equal to the sum of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$, which is $50 + 20 = 70$ square units. Since the height of both triangles $ABC$ and $ADE$ is the same, the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of their bases.\n\nLet's denote the area of triangle $ABC$ as $A_{ABC}$ and the area of triangle $DCB$ as $A_{DCB}$. The area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is equal to the sum of the areas of triangles $ABC$ and $DCB$, which is $A_{ABC} + A_{DCB}$.\n\nWe can express the area $A_{ABC}$ as $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot x \\cdot h$, where $h$ is the height of triangle $ABC$. Similarly, we can express the area $A_{DCB}$ as $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot y \\cdot h$.\n\nSince the area of triangle $ABC$ is equal to the sum of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$, we can write $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot x \\cdot h = 70$. Similarly, we can write $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot y \\cdot h = A_{DCB}$.\n\nNow, let's express the area $A_{DCB}$ in terms of the area of triangle $ADE$. Since the ratio $\\frac{x}{y}$ is equal to $\\frac{5}{2}$, we have $x = \\frac{5}{2} y$.\n\nUsing the fact that $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot x \\cdot h = 70$ and $x = \\frac{5}{2} y$, we can write:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} y \\cdot h = 70$\n\n$\\frac{5}{4} y \\cdot h = 70$\n\nNow, let's find the area $A_{DCB}$. We know that $A_{DCB} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot y \\cdot h$. Since $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} y \\cdot h = 70$, we have $\\frac{5}{4} y \\cdot h = 70$, so $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot y \\cdot h = \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot 70 = 56$.\n\nTherefore, the area of trapezoid $ABSD$ is $A_{ABC} + A_{DCB} = 70 + 56 = 126$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{126}$."
