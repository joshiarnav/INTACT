    "problem": "The area of an equilateral triangle is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides. What is the perimeter of the triangle, in units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
    "solution": "The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$. This must equal $s$. Setting the two equal and solving, we get \\begin{align*}\ns&=\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\\\\n4s&=s^2\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4 &= s\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4\\sqrt{3}&= 3s \\\\\n\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} &=s\n\\end{align*} Thus, the perimeter of the triangle is $3s=\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}} \\text{units}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the perimeter of an equilateral triangle, we need to first find the length of one of its sides.\n\nLet's denote the length of one side as s. We are given that the area of the triangle is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides. The area of an equilateral triangle with side length s is given by the formula:\n\nArea = (\u221a3/4) * s^2\n\nSince the area is numerically equal to the side length s, we can set up the equation:\n\ns = (\u221a3/4) * s^2\n\nTo find the value of s, we can divide both sides of the equation by s (since s \u2260 0):\n\n1 = (\u221a3/4) * s\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by 4/\u221a3 to isolate s:\n\ns = 4/\u221a3\n\nTo simplify the expression, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \u221a3:\n\ns = (4*\u221a3)/(\u221a3*\u221a3)\ns = (4*\u221a3)/3\n\nNow that we have found the length of one side, we can find the perimeter of the triangle. The perimeter is the sum of all three sides, which are equal in an equilateral triangle. Therefore, the perimeter is:\n\nPerimeter = 3s\nPerimeter = 3 * ((4*\u221a3)/3)\nPerimeter = 4*\u221a3\n\nThe perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 4*\u221a3 units.\n\nThe final answer is: \n$\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$"
