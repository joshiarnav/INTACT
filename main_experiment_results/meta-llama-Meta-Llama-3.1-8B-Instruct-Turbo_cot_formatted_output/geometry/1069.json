    "problem": "A triangle with side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5 is inscribed in a circle of radius 3.  What is the area of the triangle? Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $3x$, $4x$, and $5x$.  The triangle is a right triangle, so its hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle.  Thus $5x=2\\cdot 3=6$, so $x=6/5$.  The area of the triangle is \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3x\\cdot 4x =\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{18}{5}\\cdot \\frac{24}{5}\n=\\frac{216}{25}=\\boxed{8.64}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the triangle, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the side lengths of the triangle**: \nGiven that the side lengths are in the ratio 3:4:5, we can represent them as 3x, 4x, and 5x, where x is the common ratio.\n\n2. **Determine the value of x**: \nSince the triangle is inscribed in a circle with a radius of 3, the hypotenuse (5x) is equal to the diameter of the circle. Therefore, 5x = 2 * 3 (since the diameter is twice the radius), so 5x = 6.\n\n3. **Solve for x**: \nTo find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5. So, x = 6 / 5.\n\n4. **Calculate the side lengths of the triangle**: \nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into the expressions for the side lengths. The side lengths are 3x = 3(6/5), 4x = 4(6/5), and 5x = 6.\n\n5. **Find the area of the triangle**: \nTo find the area of a right-angled triangle, we can use the formula A = (1/2) * base * height. In this case, the base and height are the two shorter sides of the triangle, which are 3(6/5) and 4(6/5).\n\nFirst, we'll find the area:\nA = (1/2) * (3 * 6 / 5) * (4 * 6 / 5)\nA = (1/2) * 18/5 * 24/5\n\nMultiply the fractions and divide by 2:\nA = (18/5 * 24/5) / 2\nA = (432 / 25) / 2\nA =  432 / 50\nA =  216 / 25\n\nTo convert this to a decimal, we'll divide 216 by 25:\nA = 8.64\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 8.64.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: $\\boxed{8.64}$"
