    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ has vertices with coordinates $A(2,3),$ $B(7,8),$ and $C(-4,6)$. The triangle is reflected about line $L$. The image points are $A'(2,-5),$ $B'(7,-10),$ and $C'(-4,-8)$. What is the equation of line $L$?",
    "solution": "Since only the $y$ portions of the coordinates move, we know that the line of reflection must be a horizontal line. Now we just need to find the midpoint between an original point and its reflected image to pinpoint the location of the line. The $y$-coordinate of point $A$ is 3 and the $y$-coordinate of $A'$ is $-5$; therefore, the midpoint is at $(2, -1)$. The line of refection is $\\boxed{y = -1}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the equation of line L, we need to find the midpoint of the line segment connecting each point to its image. This is because line L is the perpendicular bisector of the line segments connecting the points to their images, and it passes through the midpoint of each segment.\n\nLet's find the midpoint of one of the line segments, for example, AA'.\n\nThe coordinates of A are (2, 3) and the coordinates of A' are (2, -5). \n\nThe midpoint formula is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n((2 + 2)/2, (3 + (-5))/2) = (2, -1).\n\nSo, the midpoint of AA' is (2, -1).\n\nNow, let's find the midpoint of BB'. \n\nThe coordinates of B are (7, 8) and the coordinates of B' are (7, -10).\n\nUsing the midpoint formula, we get:\n((7 + 7)/2, (8 + (-10))/2) = (7, -1).\n\nSo, the midpoint of BB' is also (7, -1).\n\nSince the midpoints of AA' and BB' are the same, we can conclude that line L passes through the point (2, -1).\n\nNow, let's find the slope of the line passing through the points (2, 3) and (2, -1). \n\nThe slope formula is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n(-1 - 3)/(2 - 2) = -4/-4 = 1 (undefined). Given that the line connecting (2,3) and (2,-1) is a vertical line the slope is undefined because it's undefined for any vertical line.\n\nThe slope of line L is 0 since it's a horizontal line.\n\nThe equation of a horizontal line is y = c, where c is a constant.\n\nSince line L passes through the point (2, -1), we can conclude that the equation of line L is:\n\ny = -1\n\nSo, the equation of line L is y = -1."
