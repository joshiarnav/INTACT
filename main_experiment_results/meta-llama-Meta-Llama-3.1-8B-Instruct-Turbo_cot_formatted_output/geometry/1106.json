    "problem": "Square $ABCD$ has side length $1$ unit.  Points $E$ and $F$ are on sides $AB$ and $CB$, respectively, with $AE = CF$.  When the square is folded along the lines $DE$ and $DF$, sides $AD$ and $CD$ coincide and lie on diagonal $BD$.  The length of segment $AE$ can be expressed in the form $\\sqrt{k}-m$ units. What is the integer value of $k+m$?",
    "solution": "We start by drawing a diagram.  When the paper is folded, sides $AD$ and $CD$ coincide on the longer dashed line, and points $A$ and $C$ meet at $G$, as you can see below.  [asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(1,.4)); draw((0,0)--(.4,1));\ndraw((1,.4)--(.4,1),dashed);\ndraw((0,0)--(.7,.7),dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,1), NW); label(\"$B$\",(1,1), NE); label(\"$C$\",(1,0), SE); label(\"$D$\",(0,0), SW);\nlabel(\"$F$\",(1,.4), E); label(\"$E$\",(.4,1), N);\nlabel(\"$G$\",(.7,.7), NE);\n[/asy] Now, we assign variables.  We are looking for the length of $AE$, so let $AE=x$.  Then, $BE=1-x$.  Because of the symmetry of the square and the fold, everything to the left of line $BD$ is a mirror image of everything to the right of $BD$.  Thus, $\\triangle BEF$ is an isosceles right triangle (45-45-90), so $EF=\\sqrt{2}EB = \\sqrt{2}(1-x)$.  Also, $\\triangle EGB$ and $\\triangle FGB$ are congruent 45-45-90 triangles, so $GB = \\frac{EB}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nAlso, notice that because the way the paper is folded (its original position versus its final position), we have more congruent triangles, $\\triangle AED \\cong \\triangle GED$.  This means that $AD=GD=1$.\n\nLastly, notice that since $G$ is on $BD$, we have $BD=BG+GD$. $BD$ is a diagonal of the square, so it has side length $\\sqrt{2}$, $GD=1$, and $GB = \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}$.  Thus, our equation becomes \\[\\sqrt{2} = 1 + \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}.\\] Multiplying both sides by $\\sqrt{2}$ yields $2=\\sqrt{2}+1-x$; solving for $x$ yields $x=\\sqrt{2}-1$.  Thus, $AE=\\sqrt{2}-1=\\sqrt{k}-m$, and we see that $k+m=2+1=\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the length of segment AE, we can use the given information and the properties of right triangles.\n\nFirst, let's consider the triangle AED. Since AD is a side of the square, its length is 1 unit. We can let the length of AE be x, so the length of DE is 1 - x.\n\nNow, let's consider the triangle CFD. Since CD is a side of the square, its length is 1 unit. We can let the length of CF be x, so the length of DF is 1 - x.\n\nWhen the square is folded along the lines DE and DF, the sides AD and CD coincide and lie on diagonal BD. This means that the length of AE must be equal to the length of CF, and the length of DE must be equal to the length of DF.\n\nSince the lengths of DE and DF are both 1 - x, we can set up an equation based on the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle BFD:\n\n(BD)^2 = (BF)^2 + (DF)^2\n1^2 = (1 - x)^2 + (1 - x)^2\n1 = 2(1 - x)^2\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2(1 - x)^2 = 1\n(1 - x)^2 = 1/2\n1 - x = sqrt(1/2) = 1/sqrt(2)\nx = 1 - 1/sqrt(2)\n\nWe can rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by sqrt(2):\n\nx = (sqrt(2) - 1)/sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by sqrt(2) to eliminate the square root in the denominator:\n\nx = (sqrt(2) - 1) * (sqrt(2)/sqrt(2))\nx = 2 - sqrt(2)\n\nNow we have the length of AE in the form sqrt(k) - m. We can see that k is 2 and m is 1.\n\nTherefore, k + m is 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
