    "model_solution": "To find the value of $BD$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem and the properties of right triangles in the given triangle $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nSince $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles with $AC=BC=7$, we can draw an altitude from $C$ to $AB$, which intersects $AB$ at point $E$. This makes $AE=BE$ and creates two right triangles $\\triangle ACE$ and $\\triangle BCE$. Because the altitude is perpendicular to the base, the triangles are right triangles.\n\nThe length of $CE$ can be found by applying the Pythagorean Theorem to either $\\triangle ACE$ or $\\triangle BCE$. Using $\\triangle BCE$:\n\n\\[CE^2 + BE^2 = BC^2\\]\nSince $BE=AE$, let's call the length of $AE$ (or $BE$) $x$. Then:\n\n\\[CE^2 + x^2 = 7^2\\]\n\n\\[CE^2 + x^2 = 49\\]\n\nWe know that $CE^2 + (AB/2)^2 = AC^2$ using the formula of the altitude to the hypotenuse of a right triangle. Since $AB=2$, $(AB/2)=1$.\n\n\\[CE^2 + 1^2 = 7^2\\]\n\n\\[CE^2 + 1 = 49\\]\n\n\\[CE^2 = 48\\]\n\n\\[CE = \\sqrt{48} = 4\\sqrt{3}\\]\n\nNow, we can find the length of $BD$ by applying the Pythagorean Theorem to the right triangle $\\triangle CDB$. Since $CD=8$ and $CE=4\\sqrt{3}$ (or $4\\sqrt{3}$ is the altitude from $C$ to $D$), we can apply the formula:\n\n\\[(BD-E)^2 + (CE)^2 = (CD)^2\\]\n\nLet's denote $BD-E$ as $y$. Then:\n\n\\[y^2 + (4\\sqrt{3})^2 = 8^2\\]\n\n\\[y^2 + 48 = 64\\]\n\n\\[y^2 = 16\\]\n\n\\[y = \\pm4\\]\n\nSince $BD$ is the length of a segment, it is positive, and $E$ is the point where the altitude intersects $AB$. So, $y$ has to be positive, and since $y=BD-E$, we have to consider the value of $E$ as well. We know that $AE=BE=1$ (half of the length of $AB$), and since $B$ lies between $A$ and $D$, we have $E$ as a point on the segment $AB$. Therefore, the value of $y$ must be less than or equal to the length of the segment $BD$. But we are given that the altitude from $C$ to $D$ intersects $AB$ at $E$. So, the value of $y$ has to be less than or equal to $BD$. Since we are looking for the value of $BD$, we have to exclude the point $E$ from the segment $BD$.\n\nWe know that $y$ has to be positive, and we have to consider the value of $BD-E$. Therefore, we have to add the value of $y$ to $E$ to get the value of $BD$. Since $E$ is 1, we have:\n\\[BD = 4 + 1\\]\n\\[BD = 5\\]\n\nSo, we have $\\boxed{5}$."
