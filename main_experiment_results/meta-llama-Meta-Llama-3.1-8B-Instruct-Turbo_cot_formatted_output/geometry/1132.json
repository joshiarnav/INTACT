    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ has vertices at $A(5,8)$, $B(3,-2)$, and $C(6,1)$. The point $D$ with coordinates $(m,n)$ is chosen inside the triangle so that the three small triangles $ABD$, $ACD$ and $BCD$ all have equal areas. What is the value of $10m + n$?",
    "solution": "If $D$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, then $ABD$, $ACD$, and $BCD$ would all have equal areas (to see this, remember that the medians of a triangle divide the triangle into 6 equal areas). There is only one point with this property (if we move around $D$, the area of one of the small triangles will increase and will no longer be $1/3$ of the total area). So $D$ must be the centroid of triangle $ABC$. The $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the centroid are found by averaging the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively, of the vertices, so $(m,n) = \\left( \\frac{5+3+6}{3}, \\frac{8+(-2)+1}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{14}{3}, \\frac{7}{3} \\right)$, and $10m + n = 10 \\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right) + \\frac{7}{3} = \\boxed{49}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the point $D$ inside the triangle $ABC$ such that the three small triangles $ABD$, $ACD$, and $BCD$ all have equal areas, we can use the concept of a centroid. The centroid of a triangle is the point where the medians intersect. The medians of a triangle are the lines from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. The centroid divides each median into two segments with a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.\n\nGiven the vertices $A(5,8)$, $B(3,-2)$, and $C(6,1)$, we can find the midpoint of each side and then find the centroid of the triangle. \n\nTo find the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, we use the formula $\\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right)$.\n\nThe midpoint of $AB$ is $\\left( \\frac{5 + 3}{2}, \\frac{8 - 2}{2} \\right) = (4,3)$.\n\nThe midpoint of $AC$ is $\\left( \\frac{5 + 6}{2}, \\frac{8 + 1}{2} \\right) = (5.5,4.5)$.\n\nThe midpoint of $BC$ is $\\left( \\frac{3 + 6}{2}, \\frac{-2 + 1}{2} \\right) = (4.5,-0.5)$.\n\nThe centroid of a triangle with vertices $(x_1,y_1)$, $(x_2,y_2)$, and $(x_3,y_3)$ is given by the formula $\\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3}{3} \\right)$.\n\nThe centroid of the triangle $ABC$ is $\\left( \\frac{5 + 3 + 6}{3}, \\frac{8 - 2 + 1}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{14}{3}, \\frac{7}{3} \\right)$.\n\nThe coordinates of the centroid are $(m,n) = \\left( \\frac{14}{3}, \\frac{7}{3} \\right)$. Therefore, the value of $10m + n$ is:\n\n$10m + n = 10\\left( \\frac{14}{3} \\right) + \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{140}{3} + \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{147}{3} = 49$.\n\nSo, the value of $10m + n$ is $\\boxed{49}$."
