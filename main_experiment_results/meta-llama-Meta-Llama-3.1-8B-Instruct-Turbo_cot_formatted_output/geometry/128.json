    "problem": "A hemisphere-shaped bowl with radius 1 foot is filled full with chocolate.  All of the chocolate is then evenly distributed between 27 congruent, smaller hemisphere-shaped molds.  What is the radius of each of the smaller molds, in feet?",
    "solution": "A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so a hemisphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$.  The large hemisphere-shaped bowl has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi(1^3) = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ cubic feet.\n\nLet each of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds have radius $r$.  Their total volume, in terms of $r$, is $27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$ cubic feet, so we have \\[27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi.\\]Dividing both sides by $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ yields $27r^3 =1$, so $r=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$ feet.",

    "model_solution": "To find the radius of each of the smaller molds, let's first calculate the volume of the larger hemisphere-shaped bowl. The formula for the volume of a hemisphere is (2/3)\u03c0r^3, where r is the radius.\n\nGiven that the radius of the larger bowl is 1 foot, the volume of the chocolate (and the bowl) is:\n\n(2/3)\u03c0(1)^3 = (2/3)\u03c0 cubic feet\n\nNow, we divide this volume by 27 to find the volume of each smaller mold:\n\n((2/3)\u03c0) / 27 = (2/3)\u03c0 / (3^3)\n= (2/3)\u03c0 / (27)\n= (2/3)\u03c0 / ((3^3))\n= (2/3)\u03c0 / (3^3) \n= (2/3)\u03c0 / (3 * 3 * 3) \n= (2/3) * (\u03c0/3^3)\n= (2/3) * (\u03c0/27) \n= (2 / 3) * (\u03c0/ (3^3))\n= (2 / 3) * (\u03c0/(3 * 3 * 3))\n= (2 * \u03c0) / (3^4)\n= (2 * \u03c0) / (81)\n\nThe volume of each smaller mold is (2 * \u03c0) / (81) cubic feet. Now, we set this equal to the volume of a hemisphere with radius r:\n\n(2/3)\u03c0r^3 = (2 * \u03c0) / (81)\n\nDividing both sides by (2/3)\u03c0, we get:\n\nr^3 = 1 / 27\n\nTaking the cube root of both sides, we get:\n\nr = \u221b(1/27)\n= 1/\u221b27\n= 1 / 3\n= 1/3\n\nTherefore, the radius of each of the smaller molds is 1/3 feet.\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$"
