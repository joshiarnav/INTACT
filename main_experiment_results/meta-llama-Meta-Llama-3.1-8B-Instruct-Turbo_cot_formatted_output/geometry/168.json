    "problem": "A square and a circle intersect so that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle. What is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "Drawing a diagram and adding $OM$ perpendicular to $AD$, we get\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-1,1);\nB=(1,1);\nC=(1,-1);\nD=(-1,-1);\nE=(-1,-.577);\nF=(-1,.577);\nM=(-1,0);\ndraw(circle(O,1.155));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--A);\ndraw(F--O);\ndraw(O--E);\ndraw(O--M);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"F\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, dir(0));\nlabel(\"M\", M, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (F+O)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (E+O)/2, SE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", M, W);\n[/asy] First note that $O$ is not only the center of the circle but also the center of the square since the diagram is symmetric. Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Draw a diagram**: Let's draw a diagram of the given situation. \n\n   - Draw a circle with center O and a square that intersects the circle in such a way that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle.\n\n   - Let's label the center of the circle as O, the midpoint of one of the sides of the square as M, and the point where a side of the square intersects the circle as P.\n\n2. **Find the side length of the square**: Let the radius of the circle be r. Draw a line from O to M. This line is the radius of the circle and also bisects the angle OMP.\n\n   - Since each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle, PM = r.\n\n   - Draw a perpendicular line from M to the side of the square. This line bisects the side of the square and intersects the side at point Q.\n\n   - The length of MQ is half the length of the side of the square. Since triangle OMP is isosceles and the length of OP is also r, the length of OM = r. Therefore, triangle OMQ is a right triangle with hypotenuse r and leg MQ.\n\n   - Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the length of MQ: $MQ^2 + OM^2 = OM^2$ is incorrect, as we're dealing with an isosceles triangle and should consider that the angle OMQ is the right angle and that MQ = (r/2)*sin(\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle between the chord and the side of the square. \n\n   - Given that triangle OMQ is a right triangle, we can also find MQ by using the fact that the chord of the circle (in this case, PM) has a length equal to the radius of the circle. Using this fact, the angle between the chord and the radius is 60\u00b0, which results in a 30-60-90 right triangle.\n\n   - Given that we have a 30-60-90 triangle, we can determine that MQ = r/2.\n\n   - The length of the side of the square is twice the length of MQ, so the length of the side of the square is $2 \\cdot (r/2) = r$ is incorrect. The actual value for it should be $2 \\cdot (r/2) = r$ is incorrect, since we know that an isosceles triangle has been created, with the base of the triangle being twice the value of its height (in this case, the height is the length of r/2). The base of an isosceles triangle is the side of the square. Since each of the four triangles (OQP, OPQ, OMP, and MPO) in the square is an isosceles triangle with a base of length r and height of r/2, each of the triangles should be a 30-60-90 right triangle, which has a base of r.\n\n   - The length of the side of the square is twice the length of the radius of the circle multiplied by sin(60\u00b0).\n\n   - The length of the side of the square is $2 \\cdot (r \\cdot \\sin(60\u00b0))$ =  $\\sqrt{3}r$.\n\n3. **Find the areas of the square and the circle**: Now that we have the side length of the square and the radius of the circle, we can find their areas.\n\n   - The area of the square is $(\\sqrt{3}r)^2 = 3r^2$.\n\n   - The area of the circle is $\\pi r^2$.\n\n\n4. **Find the ratio of the areas of the square and the circle**: The ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is the area of the square divided by the area of the circle.\n\n   - The ratio is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}$.\n\n   - Canceling out the r^2 terms, the ratio is $\\frac{3}{\\pi}$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$."
