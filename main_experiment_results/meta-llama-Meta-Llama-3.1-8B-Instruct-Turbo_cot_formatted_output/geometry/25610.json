It is given that \\[140=4a+4b+4c{\\qquad \\rm and\n\\qquad}21=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}\\] hence \\[35=a+b+c{\\qquad (1)\\qquad\n\\rm and\\qquad}441=a^2+b^2+c^2{\\qquad (2)}.\\]\n\nSquare both sides of $(1)$ and combine with $(2)$ to obtain \\begin{align*}\n1225 & = (a+b+c)^2 \\\\\n&= a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2bc+2ca \\\\\n&= 441+2ab+2bc+2ca.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus the surface area of the box is \\[ 2ab+2bc+2ca=1225-441=\\boxed{784}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To find the total surface area of the box, we need to determine the dimensions of the box and then calculate the surface area.\n\nLet's denote the length, width, and height of the box as $l$, $w$, and $h$ respectively.\n\nGiven that the sum of the lengths of the twelve edges of the box is $140$, we can write an equation:\n\n\\[4 \\times (l + w + h) = 140\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[l + w + h = 35\\]\n\nGiven that the distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner is $21$, we can use the three-dimensional formula for the distance between two points:\n\n\\[\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}\\]\n\nIn this case, the formula becomes:\n\n\\[\\sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (l - 0)^2 + (w - 0)^2 + (h - 0)^2}\\]\n\\[\\sqrt{(l - 0)^2 + (w - 0)^2 + (h - 0)^2}\\]\n\\[\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}\\]\n\nThis must be equal to $21$, so we can write:\n\n\\[\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = 21\\]\nSquaring both sides:\n\\[l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = 21^2\\]\n\\[l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = 441\\]\n\nNow, we can use the equation we found earlier ($l + w + h = 35$) to solve for $l^2 + w^2 + h^2$. Squaring this equation gives:\n\n\\[l^2 + w^2 + h^2 + 2lw + 2lh + 2hw = 1225\\]\n\nSubstituting $l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = 441$, we get:\n\n\\[441 + 2lw + 2lh + 2hw = 1225\\]\n\nSimplifying the equation gives:\n\n\\[2lw + 2lh + 2hw = 784\\]\n\nDividing both sides by $2$:\n\n\\[lw + lh + hw = 392\\]\n\nNow, we can use this formula to find the surface area of the box. The surface area of the box is equal to:\n\n\\[2lw + 2lh + 2hw\\]\n\nSimplifying this gives:\n\n\\[2(lw + lh + hw)\\]\n\nWe can substitute $lw + lh + hw = 392$ into the formula:\n\n\\[2(392) = 784\\]\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the box is:\n\n$\\boxed{784}$"
