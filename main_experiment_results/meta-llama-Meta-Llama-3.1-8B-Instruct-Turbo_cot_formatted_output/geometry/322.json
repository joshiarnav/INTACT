    "problem": "The radius of a cylinder is doubled and its height is tripled. If its original volume was 10 cubic feet, what is its volume now, in cubic feet?",
    "solution": "Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively.  The new cylinder has volume \\[\n\\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\\pi r^2 h,\n\\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume.  Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.",

    "model_solution": "To find the new volume of the cylinder, we need to understand how the changes in radius and height affect the volume. The original volume of the cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nV = \u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nwhere V is the volume, \u03c0 is a constant, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nGiven that the radius is doubled and the height is tripled, we can substitute these new values into the volume formula:\n\nNew radius (r') = 2r\nNew height (h') = 3h\n\nThe new volume (V') is then given by:\n\nV' = \u03c0(r')\u00b2(h')\n\nSubstituting the new values for radius and height:\n\nV' = \u03c0(2r)\u00b2(3h)\n= \u03c0(4r\u00b2)(3h)\n= 12\u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nNow, we need to find the relationship between the original volume (V) and the new volume (V'). We know that the original volume is given by:\n\nV = \u03c0r\u00b2h\n\nComparing the original volume formula with the new volume formula, we can see that the new volume (V') is 12 times the original volume (V):\n\nV' = 12V\n\nGiven that the original volume was 10 cubic feet, we can find the new volume:\n\nV' = 12(10 cubic feet)\n= 120 cubic feet\n\nTherefore, the new volume of the cylinder is 120 cubic feet."
