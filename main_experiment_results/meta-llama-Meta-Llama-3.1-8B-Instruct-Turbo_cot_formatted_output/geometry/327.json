    "problem": "The square with vertices $(-a, -a), (a, -a), (-a, a), (a, a)$ is cut by the line $y = x/2$ into congruent quadrilaterals.  The perimeter of one of these congruent quadrilaterals divided by $a$ equals what?  Express your answer in simplified radical form.",
    "solution": "The line $y=\\frac x2$ will intersect the two vertical sides of the square, as shown below:\n[asy]\nreal f(real x)\n{\n\nreturn x/2;\n}\n\nimport graph;\nsize(6cm);\nreal a = 8;\npair A=(-a,a), B=(a,a), C=(a,-a), D=(-a,-a);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\ndraw(graph(f,-11,11),Arrows);\naxes(Arrows(4));\ndot(\"$(-a,a)$\",A,N);\ndot(\"$(a,a)$\",B,N);\ndot(\"$(a,-a)$\",C,S);\ndot(\"$(-a,-a)$\",D,S);\nreal eps=0.2;\ndot((8,4)^^(-8,-4));\ndraw(shift((10,0))*\"$2a$\",(-a+eps,-a/2-.5)--(a-eps,-a/2-.5),Arrows);\ndraw(shift((0,10))*\"$a$\",(a+2*eps,-a/2)--(a+2*eps,a/2),Arrows);[/asy]\nThe equation of the right side of the square is $x=a,$ so we have $y= \\frac x2 = \\frac a2,$ which means that the intersection point with the right side of the square is $\\left(a, \\frac a2 \\right).$ Similarly, the equation of the left side of the square is $x=-a,$ so we have $y= \\frac x2 = -\\frac a2,$ which means that the intersection point with the left side of the square is $\\left(-a, -\\frac a2 \\right).$ It follows that the sides of each quadrilateral have lengths $\\frac a2,$ $2a,$ $\\frac{3a}2,$ and $\\sqrt{a^2 + (2a)^2} = a\\sqrt{5},$ by the Pythagorean theorem. Hence, the perimeter of the quadrilateral is \\[\\frac a2 + 2a + \\frac{3a}2 + a\\sqrt{5} = \\left(4+\\sqrt5\\right)a,\\]and when this is divided by $a,$ we get $\\boxed{4+\\sqrt{5}}.$",
