    "problem": "What is the volume in cubic inches of a right, rectangular prism with side, front and bottom faces having an area 15 square inches, 10 square inches and 6 square inches, respectively?",
    "solution": "Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of the right, rectangular prism, we need to find the length, width, and height of the prism. \n\nLet's denote the length as 'l', the width as 'w', and the height as 'h'. The volume 'V' of a rectangular prism is given by V = lwh.\n\nGiven the areas of the side, front, and bottom faces are 15, 10, and 6 square inches, respectively. We can set up the following equations:\n\nlw = 15  ... (1)\nlh = 10  ... (2)\nwh = 6   ... (3)\n\nMultiplying equations (1), (2), and (3) together, we get:\n(lw)(lh)(wh) = 15 * 10 * 6\nl^2w^2h^2 = 900\n\nNow, taking the square root of both sides, we get:\nlwh = \u221a900\nlwh = 30\n\nSince lwh is the volume 'V' of the rectangular prism, we have:\n\nV = 30 cubic inches\n\nTherefore, the volume in cubic inches of the right, rectangular prism is $\\boxed{30}$."
