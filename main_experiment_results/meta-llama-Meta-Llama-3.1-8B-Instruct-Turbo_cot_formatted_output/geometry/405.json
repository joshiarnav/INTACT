    "model_solution": "To find the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$, we should start by considering the properties of a triangle. \n\nGiven that the perimeter of triangle $ABC$ is 2007 units, we can express this as the sum of its side lengths: $AB + BC + AC = 2007$.\n\nSince the side lengths are integers and $AB < BC \\leq AC$, we need to find a combination that satisfies these conditions.\n\nOne of the most fundamental properties of a triangle is the Triangle Inequality Theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side.\n\nLet's consider the fact that the perimeter is odd (2007). For the perimeter to be odd, we must have an odd number of even numbers. Since the sum of two even numbers is even, and the sum of an even and an odd number is odd, we can deduce that there must be at least one odd side length and two even side lengths (or vice versa).\n\nAssuming $AB$ and $BC$ are even, $AC$ must be odd. However, this would not allow us to find the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$. \n\nTherefore, let's assume $AB$ and $AC$ are even, and $BC$ is odd. This allows us to find the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$. \n\nSince $AB < BC$, we know that $BC - AB > 0$. \n\nTo minimize $BC - AB$, we need to minimize $BC$ and maximize $AB$. Since $AB$ and $AC$ are even, let's express them as $2a$ and $2b$ respectively, where $a$ and $b$ are integers.\n\nWe have $2a + BC + 2b = 2007$. \n\nSince $BC$ is odd, let's express it as $2c + 1$, where $c$ is an integer.\n\nWe have $2a + (2c + 1) + 2b = 2007$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $2a + 2b + 2c + 1 = 2007$.\n\nRearranging, we get $2(a + b + c) = 2006$.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get $a + b + c = 1003$.\n\nSince $AB = 2a$, $BC = 2c + 1$, and $AC = 2b$, we have:\n\n$BC - AB = (2c + 1) - 2a$\n\nWe want to minimize $BC - AB$. This occurs when $a$ is maximized and $c$ is minimized.\n\nSince $a + b + c = 1003$, and $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers, $a$ is maximized when $b$ and $c$ are minimized. However, since $BC = 2c + 1$, $c$ cannot be zero. \n\nLet's minimize $c$ by setting $c = 1$. Then $BC = 3$.\n\nTo maximize $a$, we set $b = 0$.\n\nThen $a + 1 + 0 = 1003$, or $a = 1002$.\n\nWe have $AB = 2a = 2004$.\n\nSo, the smallest possible value of $BC - AB$ is $3 - 2004 = \\boxed{1}$."
