    "solution": "We first draw a diagram: [asy]\npair A, B, C, E, F;\nA = (0, 4);\nB = (-3, 0);\nC = (7, 0);\nE = 0.5 * A + 0.5 * C;\nF = 0.5 * A + 0.5 * B;\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--E--F--cycle);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\n[/asy] Since $F$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, the area of $\\triangle AFC$ is half of the area of $\\triangle ABC,$ or 12 square units. Following the same reasoning, we see that $E$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AC},$ so the area of $\\triangle CEF$ is half that of $\\triangle AFC,$ or $\\boxed{6}$ square units.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of $\\triangle CEF$, we can use the fact that it is similar to $\\triangle ABC$ and that the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.\n\nFirst, let's understand the relationship between $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle CEF$. Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of sides $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{AB}$, $\\triangle CEF$ is similar to $\\triangle ABC$ by the Midpoint Theorem. \n\nThe ratio of the corresponding side lengths of the two triangles is 1/2. This is because $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of the sides, so the length of $\\overline{EF}$ is half the length of $\\overline{AB}$, and the length of $\\overline{CE}$ is half the length of $\\overline{AC}$.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths. \n\nThe ratio of the area of $\\triangle CEF$ to the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $(1/2)^2 = 1/4$. This means that the area of $\\triangle CEF$ is 1/4 of the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nWe know that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is 24 square units. Therefore, the area of $\\triangle CEF$ is:\n\nArea of $\\triangle CEF$ = (1/4) \u00d7 Area of $\\triangle ABC$\n= (1/4) \u00d7 24\n= 6\n\nSo, the area of $\\triangle CEF$ is $\\boxed{6}$ square units."
