    "model_solution": "To find $\\cos \\angle AMB$, we need to consider the geometry of the regular tetrahedron $ABCD$ and the location of midpoint $M$ of $\\overline{CD}$.\n\n1. **Midpoint of CD**: The midpoint $M$ of $\\overline{CD}$ will divide the edge into two equal segments. Let the lengths of the sides of the tetrahedron be $s$.\n\n   So, $\\overline{CM} = \\overline{MD} = \\frac{s}{2}$.\n\n2. **Altitude of the Tetrahedron**: Since $ABCD$ is a regular tetrahedron, the altitude from any vertex to the opposite face is also the perpendicular bisector of that face. The altitude from $A$ to $BCD$ will also pass through $M$.\n\n   Let the altitude from $A$ to the base $BCD$ meet $BC$ at $N$. Then $AN$ is also the altitude of the regular triangle $BCD$. Since $BCD$ is equilateral, all its interior angles are $60^{\\circ}$.\n\n   Therefore, $AN$ bisects $\\angle BAC$ and $\\angle BCA$. Since $ABCD$ is a regular tetrahedron, these bisected angles are each $30^{\\circ}$. So, $\\triangle ANB$ is a $30-60-90^{\\circ}$ triangle.\n\n   In a $30-60-90^{\\circ}$ triangle, the sides are in the ratio $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$. Since $AN$ is the altitude of the equilateral triangle $BCD$, and the altitude of an equilateral triangle divides it into two $30-60-90^{\\circ}$ triangles, we have $AN = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s$.\n\n3. **Lengths of AM and BM**: To find $\\cos \\angle AMB$, we need to know the lengths of $AM$ and $BM$. These lengths can be found using the Pythagorean theorem on the right triangles $AMN$ and $BMN$.\n\n   We have $\\triangle AMN = \\triangle BMN$. $AN = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s$ and $MN = \\frac{s}{2}$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get $AM^2 = AN^2 + MN^2 = \\frac{3s^2}{4} + \\frac{s^2}{4} = s^2$ and $BM^2 = AN^2 + MN^2 = \\frac{3s^2}{4} + \\frac{s^2}{4} = s^2$.\n\n   Therefore, $AM = BM = s$.\n\n4. **Cosine of Angle AMB**: Since $\\triangle AMB$ is an isosceles triangle, the cosine of $\\angle AMB$ can be found using the formula: $\\cos \\angle AMB = \\frac{AB^2 - AM^2 - BM^2}{-2 \\cdot AM \\cdot BM}$.\n\n   Since $AB = s$, and we have $AM = BM = s$, we can substitute these values in the formula. We get $\\cos \\angle AMB = \\frac{s^2 - s^2 - s^2}{-2 \\cdot s \\cdot s} = \\frac{-s^2}{-2s^2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSo, the value of $\\cos \\angle AMB$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
