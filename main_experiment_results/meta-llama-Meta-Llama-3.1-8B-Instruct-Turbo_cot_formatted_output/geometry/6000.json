Now, we have a regular tetrahedron $EFGH$, which by symmetry has twice the volume of our original solid. This tetrahedron has side length $2s = 12\\sqrt{2}$. Using the formula for the volume of a regular tetrahedron, which is $V = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}S^3}{12}$, where S is the side length of the tetrahedron, the volume of our original solid is:\n$V = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot (12\\sqrt{2})^3}{12} = \\boxed{288}$.",

    "model_solution": "To calculate the volume of the solid, we need to find the area of the base and the height of the solid. \n\nThe base of the solid is a square with side length $s$. We are given that $s = 6\\sqrt{2}$. \n\nThe area of the base is $s^2 = (6\\sqrt{2})^2 = 72$.\n\nNow, we need to find the height of the solid. The solid can be divided into two congruent pyramids. We can use the lengths of the edges to find the height of one of the pyramids. \n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that triangle $\\triangle CEF$ is a right triangle, and $\\triangle CEB$ is a right triangle as well. \n\nSince all the edges have length $s$ and $s=6\\sqrt{2}$, we can find the lengths of the edges of the triangles.\n\nWe can find the height of the pyramid by finding the length of the altitude of triangle $\\triangle CEB$.\n\nThe altitude of $\\triangle CEB$ is equal to the altitude of $\\triangle CEF$. Let's call this length $h$.\n\nSince triangle $\\triangle CEF$ is a right triangle, we can apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the height:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nh^2 + (\\frac{s}{2})^2 &= s^2 \\\\\nh^2 + (\\frac{6\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 &= (6\\sqrt{2})^2 \\\\\nh^2 + 18 &= 72 \\\\\nh^2 &= 54 \\\\\nh &= \\sqrt{54} = 3\\sqrt{6}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince we have the height of one pyramid, the total height of the solid is $h = 3\\sqrt{6}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume of the solid:\n\nThe volume of the solid is equal to the area of the base multiplied by the height of one pyramid multiplied by 2:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV &= 2 \\cdot (\\text{area of base}) \\cdot (\\text{height of one pyramid}) \\\\\nV &= 2 \\cdot 72 \\cdot 3\\sqrt{6} \\\\\nV &= 432\\sqrt{6} \\\\\nV &= \\boxed{432\\sqrt{6}}\n\\end{align*}"
