By the Two Tangent Theorem, $AP = AQ = 23$, $BP = BR = 27$, and $CQ = CR = x$. Using $rs = A$, where $s = \\frac{27 \\cdot 2 + 23 \\cdot 2 + x \\cdot 2}{2} = 50 + x$, we get $(21)(50 + x) = A$. By Heron's formula, $A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{(50+x)(x)(23)(27)}$. Equating and squaring both sides,\n\\begin{eqnarray*}  [21(50+x)]^2 &=& (50+x)(x)(621)\\\\ 441(50+x) &=& 621x\\\\ 180x = 441 \\cdot 50 &\\Longrightarrow & x = \\frac{245}{2}   \\end{eqnarray*}\nWe want the perimeter, which is $2s = 2\\left(50 + \\frac{245}{2}\\right) = \\boxed{345}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Understanding the problem\nThe inscribed circle of triangle $ABC$ is tangent to $\\overline{AB}$ at $P,$ and its radius is $21$. We are given that $AP=23$ and $PB=27$. Our goal is to find the perimeter of the triangle.\n\nStep 2: Finding the length of the tangent line from the incenter to the side\nSince the inscribed circle is tangent to $\\overline{AB}$ at $P$, $AP$ and $PB$ are tangents from the vertices $A$ and $B$ to the inscribed circle. Therefore, $AP$ and $PB$ are equal to the radii of the circle minus the lengths of the segments from the vertices to the points of tangency. \n\nLet's denote the point of tangency between the inscribed circle and side $BC$ as $Q$, and the point of tangency between the inscribed circle and side $AC$ as $R$. Let's also denote the point of tangency between the inscribed circle and side $AB$ as $P$ (already given).\n\nNow, let's find the length of the tangent line from the incenter to side $BC$. Since the radius of the inscribed circle is $21$, we have $PQ=21$. \n\nStep 3: Finding the length of the tangent line from the incenter to side $AC$\nWe can find the length of $AR$ by noticing that $AR$ is equal to the radius of the inscribed circle plus the segment from the incenter to the point of tangency with side $AC$. Let's denote the incenter of the triangle as $O$. Therefore, $AR=AO+OR=21+AP=44$.\n\nStep 4: Finding the length of the tangent line from the incenter to side $AB$\nWe are already given that $PB=27$. Therefore, $AP=23$, and $AB=AP+PB=23+27=50$.\n\nStep 5: Finding the perimeter of the triangle\nWe can use the lengths of the sides of the triangle to find the perimeter of the triangle. Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $AB+BC+CA=50+2(AR+PQ)=50+2(44+21)=50+2(65)=130+130=260$."
