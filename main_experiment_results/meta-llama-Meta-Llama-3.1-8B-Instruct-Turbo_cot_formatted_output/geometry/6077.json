    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with $AC = 7,$ $BC = 24,$ and right angle at $C.$ Point $M$ is the midpoint of $AB,$ and $D$ is on the same side of line $AB$ as $C$ so that $AD = BD = 15.$ Given that the area of triangle $CDM$ may be expressed as $\\frac {m\\sqrt {n}}{p},$ where $m,$ $n,$ and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, find $m + n + p.$\n",
    "solution": "We use the Pythagorean Theorem on $ABC$ to determine that $AB=25.$\nLet $N$ be the orthogonal projection from $C$ to $AB.$ Thus, $[CDM]=\\frac{(DM)(MN)} {2}$, $MN=AM-AN$, and $[ABC]=\\frac{24 \\cdot 7} {2} =\\frac{25 \\cdot (CN)} {2}.$\nFrom the third equation, we get $CN=\\frac{168} {25}.$\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem in $\\Delta ACN,$ we have\n$AN=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{24 \\cdot 25} {25}\\right)^2-\\left(\\frac{24 \\cdot 7} {25}\\right)^2}=\\frac{24} {25}\\sqrt{25^2-7^2}=\\frac{576} {25}.$\nThus, $MN=\\frac{576} {25}-\\frac{25} {2}=\\frac{527} {50}.$\nIn $\\Delta ADM$, we use the Pythagorean Theorem to get $DM=\\sqrt{15^2-\\left(\\frac{25} {2}\\right)^2}=\\frac{5} {2} \\sqrt{11}.$\nThus, $[CDM]=\\frac{527 \\cdot 5\\sqrt{11}} {50 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2}= \\frac{527\\sqrt{11}} {40}.$\nHence, the answer is $527+11+40=\\boxed{578}.$",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will first use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of side $AB$ in triangle $ABC$.\n\nGiven: \n- $AC = 7$\n- $BC = 24$\n\nWe know that for a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse ($AB$ in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides ($AC$ and $BC$). \n\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem: \n$AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2$\n\n$AB^2 = 7^2 + 24^2$\n\n$AB^2 = 49 + 576$\n\n$AB^2 = 625$\n\n$AB = \\sqrt{625}$\n\n$AB = 25$\n\nNow that we have the length of side $AB$, we can find the length of $MN$ and $MD$ using the lengths of $AD$ and $AB$. To do this, we need to use the fact that point $M$ is the midpoint of side $AB$. This means that $AM = MB = \\frac{AB}{2} = \\frac{25}{2}$.\n\nSince $AD = 15$ and $AM = \\frac{25}{2}$, we have $AM^2 + DM^2 = AD^2$. Using this we can find $DM$:\n\n$DM^2 = 15^2 - \\left( \\frac{25}{2} \\right)^2$\n\n$DM^2 = 225 - \\frac{625}{4}$\n\n$DM^2 = 225 - 156.25$\n\n$DM^2 = 68.75$\n\n$DM = \\sqrt{68.75}$\n\n$DM = \\frac{\\sqrt{275}}{2}$\n\nNow we can find the area of triangle $CDM$. We need to find the length of $CM$, which is the altitude of triangle $CDM$. This can be found using the length of side $AC$ and the length of side $BC$. To find the altitude of a triangle, we can use the formula for the area of the triangle and solve for the altitude.\n\nGiven: \n- $AC = 7$\n- $BC = 24$\n\nThe area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(AC)(BC)$. \n\n$Area_{ABC} = \\frac{1}{2}(7)(24)$\n\n$Area_{ABC} = 84$\n\nThe area of triangle $CDM$ is also $Area_{CDM} = \\frac{1}{2}(CM)(CD)$. \n\nWe know that $CD = BD - AD = 15 - 15 = 0$. This would make $Area_{CDM} = 0$, which is not correct. To solve this, we will use the formula for the area of a triangle using its base and height. We will use the length of $CD$ as the base of the triangle. \n\n$Area_{CDM} = \\frac{1}{2}(CD)(DM)$\n\nHowever, we are given that $CD = 0$ is not a solution, so we will use the length of $CM$ as the height of the triangle. \n\n$Area_{CDM} = \\frac{1}{2}(DM)(CM)$\n\nWe can use the formula for the area of the triangle $ABC$ to find the length of the altitude $CM$. \n\n$Area_{ABC} = \\frac{1}{2}(AC)(BC)$\n\n$84 = \\frac{1}{2}(7)(24)$\n\nNow we will use the formula for the area of a triangle using its base and height. We will use the length of $AC$ as the base of the triangle and the height as the altitude $CM$. \n\n$Area_{ABC} = \\frac{1}{2}(AC)(CM)$\n\n$84 = \\frac{1}{2}(7)(CM)$\n\n$\\frac{84}{7} = \\frac{1}{2}(CM)$\n\n$12 = \\frac{1}{2}(CM)$\n\n$24 = CM$\n\nNow we can find the area of triangle $CDM$. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle using its base and height. We will use the length of $CD$ as the base of the triangle and the height as the altitude $CM$. However, we are given that $CD = 0$ is not a solution, so we will use the length of $DM$ as the base of the triangle and the height as the altitude $CM$. \n\n$Area_{CDM} = \\frac{1}{2}(DM)(CM)$\n\n$Area_{CDM} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{275}}{2} \\right)(24)$\n\n$Area_{CDM} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{24 \\sqrt{275}}{2} \\right)$\n\n$Area_{CDM} = \\frac{12 \\sqrt{275}}{1}$\n\n$Area_{CDM} = \\frac{12 \\sqrt{275}}{1}$\n\n$Area_{CDM} = \\frac{12\\sqrt{275}}{1}$\n\nThe area of triangle $CDM$ may be expressed as $\\frac {m\\sqrt {n}}{p}$. \n\nGiven: \n- $m = 12$\n- $n = 275$\n- $p = 1$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{288}$."
