    "problem": "Square $ABCD$ has sides of length 2. Set $S$ is the set of all line segments that have length 2 and whose endpoints are on adjacent sides of the square. The midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ enclose a region whose area to the nearest hundredth is $k$. Find $100k$.\n",
    "solution": "Without loss of generality, let $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, $(0,2)$, and $(2,2)$ be the vertices of the square. Suppose the endpoints of the segment lie on the two sides of the square determined by the vertex $(0,0)$. Let the two endpoints of the segment have coordinates $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$. Because the segment has length 2, $x^2+y^2=4$. Using the midpoint formula, we find that the midpoint of the segment has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Let $d$ be the distance from $(0,0)$ to $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Using the distance formula we see that $d=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2}= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}\\left(x^2+y^2\\right)}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}(4)}=1$. Thus the midpoints lying on the sides determined by vertex $(0,0)$ form a quarter-circle with radius 1.\n[asy] size(100); pointpen=black;pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); pair A=(0,0),B=(2,0),C=(2,2),D=(0,2); D(A--B--C--D--A);  picture p; draw(p,CR(A,1));draw(p,CR(B,1));draw(p,CR(C,1));draw(p,CR(D,1)); clip(p,A--B--C--D--cycle); add(p); [/asy]\nThe set of all midpoints forms a quarter circle at each corner of the square.

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Visualize the problem**: First, let's draw a square $ABCD$ with sides of length 2 and understand what set $S$ represents. Set $S$ is a collection of line segments with a length of 2, and their endpoints lie on adjacent sides of the square.\n\n2. **Identify the line segments in set $S$**: We can consider the line segments in set $S$ as the lines connecting the adjacent sides of the square.\n\n3. **Find the midpoints of the line segments in set $S$**: The midpoints of these line segments will be the points that are equidistant from the endpoints of the line segments.\n\n4. **Realize the pattern of the midpoints**: The midpoints form quarter circles at each corner of the square.\n\n5. **Calculate the area enclosed by the midpoints**: The area enclosed by the midpoints is the total area of the square minus the areas of the four quarter circles.\n\n6. **Calculate the area of the square**: The area of the square is given by the formula $side^2$, where the side length is 2. So, the area of the square is $2^2 = 4$.\n\n7. **Calculate the area of the quarter circles**: Each quarter circle has a radius of 1 (since the line segments in set $S$ have a length of 2). The area of a quarter circle is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius. So, the area of each quarter circle is $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi(1^2) = \\frac{1}{4}\\pi$. Since there are four quarter circles, the total area is $4 \\times \\frac{1}{4}\\pi = \\pi$.\n\n8. **Calculate the area enclosed by the midpoints**: The area enclosed by the midpoints is the area of the square minus the area of the four quarter circles. So, the area is $4 - \\pi$.\n\n9. **Round the area to the nearest hundredth**: We need to round the area to the nearest hundredth. The area is approximately $4 - 3.14 = 0.86$.\n\n10. **Find $100k$**: We need to find $100k$, where $k$ is the rounded area. So, $100k = 100 \\times 0.86 = 86$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{86}$."
