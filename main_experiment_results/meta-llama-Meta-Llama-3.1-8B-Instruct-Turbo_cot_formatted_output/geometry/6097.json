    "solution": "Rewrite the given equations as $(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 256$ and $(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 16$.\nLet $w_3$ have center $(x,y)$ and radius $r$. Now, if two circles with radii $r_1$ and $r_2$ are externally tangent, then the distance between their centers is $r_1 + r_2$, and if they are internally tangent, it is $|r_1 - r_2|$. So we have\n\\begin{align*} r + 4 &= \\sqrt{(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\\\ 16 - r &= \\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\end{align*}\nSolving for $r$ in both equations and setting them equal, then simplifying, yields\n\\begin{align*} 20 - \\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2} &= \\sqrt{(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\\\ 20+x &= 2\\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\end{align*}\nSquaring again and canceling yields $1 = \\frac{x^2}{100} + \\frac{(y-12)^2}{75}.$\nSo the locus of points that can be the center of the circle with the desired properties is an ellipse.\n[asy] size(220); pointpen = black; pen d = linewidth(0.7); pathpen = d;  pair A = (-5, 12), B = (5, 12), C = (0, 0); D(CR(A,16));D(CR(B,4));D(shift((0,12)) * yscale(3^.5 / 2) * CR(C,10), linetype(\"2 2\") + d + red); D((0,30)--(0,-10),Arrows(4));D((15,0)--(-25,0),Arrows(4));D((0,0)--MP(\"y=ax\",(14,14 * (69/100)^.5),E),EndArrow(4));  void bluecirc (real x) {  pair P = (x, (3 * (25 - x^2 / 4))^.5 + 12); dot(P, blue);  D(CR(P, ((P.x - 5)^2 + (P.y - 12)^2)^.5 - 4) , blue + d + linetype(\"4 4\")); }  bluecirc(-9.2); bluecirc(-4); bluecirc(3); [/asy]\nSince the center lies on the line $y = ax$, we substitute for $y$ and expand:\\[1 = \\frac{x^2}{100} + \\frac{(ax-12)^2}{75} \\Longrightarrow (3+4a^2)x^2 - 96ax + 276 = 0.\\]\nWe want the value of $a$ that makes the line $y=ax$ tangent to the ellipse, which will mean that for that choice of $a$ there is only one solution to the most recent equation. But a quadratic has one solution iff its discriminant is $0$, so $(-96a)^2 - 4(3+4a^2)(276) = 0$.\nSolving yields $a^2 = \\frac{69}{100}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{169}$.",

However, we don't know the radius of the desired circle yet, but we do know that the radius of $w_1$ is 16.\n\nStep 4: The desired circle is externally tangent to $w_2$ and internally tangent to $w_1$, so we can set up the following equations.\n\n\\[d_1^2=(x-5)^2+(y-12)^2=(r+13)^2\\]\n\\[d_2^2=(x+5)^2+(y-12)^2=(r-16)^2\\]\nwhere r is the radius of the desired circle.\n\nStep 5: We are given that the line $y=ax$ contains the center of the desired circle.\n\nSo, we can substitute $y=ax$ into the equations for $d_1^2$ and $d_2^2$.\n\n\\[d_1^2=(x-5)^2+(ax-12)^2=(r+13)^2\\]\n\\[d_2^2=(x+5)^2+(ax-12)^2=(r-16)^2\\]\n\nStep 6: Since the desired circle lies on the line $y=ax$, we can substitute $y=ax$ into the equations for $d_1^2$ and $d_2^2$ and then simplify.\n\nFor $d_1^2$:\n\\[(x-5)^2+(ax-12)^2=(r+13)^2\\]\nExpanding both sides gives:\n\\[x^2-10x+25+a^2x^2-24ax+144=r^2+26r+169\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[(a^2+1)x^2+(-24a-10)x+169+(144-r^2-26r)=0\\]\n\nFor $d_2^2$:\n\\[(x+5)^2+(ax-12)^2=(r-16)^2\\]\nExpanding both sides gives:\n\\[x^2+10x+25+a^2x^2-24ax+144=r^2-32r+256\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[(a^2+1)x^2+(-24a+10)x+256+144-r^2+32r=0\\]\n\nThe two equations from $d_1^2$ and $d_2^2$ have x-coordinates that must be equal to each other, so we can set the equations for x equal to each other and then solve for $a$.\n\nThe two equations from $d_1^2$ and $d_2^2$ have x-coordinates that must be equal to each other, so we can set the equations for x equal to each other and then solve for $a$.\n\nStep 7: We can set the equations for x equal to each other and then solve for $a$.\n\nWe can subtract the two equations for x:\n\n$$(a^2+1)(-24a-10) - (-24a+10)(24a-10) = 0$$\n\nSimplifying the equation gives:\n\n$$-24a^3-10a^2-24a^2+10a+576a-100=0$$\n\nSimplifying the equation further gives:\n\n$$-24a^3-34a^2+586a-100=0$$\n\nSimplifying the equation further gives:\n\n$$-2a^3-4.1667a^2+29.6667a-8.3333=0$$\n\nDividing by -2:\n\n$$a^3+2.0833a^2-14.8333a+4.1667=0$$\n\nStep 8: We can use a numerical method to find the value of $a$ that solves this equation. Since the value of $a$ is required, we can try different numerical methods to find the correct solution.\n\nA numerical method is a method for finding the solution of an equation, such as finding the roots of a polynomial. Since we're given that $m^2=\\frac{p}{q}$, we want to find the value of $a$ that solves this equation. One possible method is to use the Newton-Raphson method to find the roots of the equation.\n\nHowever, this method can be complicated to implement manually and doesn't give a general solution. A more complicated numerical method would be necessary to find the roots.\n\nStep 9: Consider that the solution may be $a = \\frac{12}{5}$ if we rewrite $-24a^3-34a^2+586a-100=0$ as a quadratic in terms of $a^2$:\n\nLet $x=a^2$.  Then $24x^{\\frac{3}{2}}+34x-586+100=0$.\n\nHowever, this is not a quadratic in terms of $x$. But we can make it so by making $x$ equal to $(a-2)^2$.  Thus, $24(a-2)^2+34(a-2)-586+100=0$.  Adding $24(a-2)^2$ and $34(a-2)$ to both sides yields $0=24(a-2)^2+34(a-2)-486$.  Since $(a-2)^2=a^2-4a+4$, then we have $0=24(a^2-4a+4)+34(a-2)-486$.  This can be simplified to $0=24a^2-96a+96+34a-68-486$ or $0=24a^2-62a-478$.\n\nStep 10: Using the quadratic formula, we can find the solutions to this quadratic equation.\n\n$$a=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$\n\nIn this case, $a=24$, $b=-62$, and $c=-478$. Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\n$$a=\\frac{-(-62) \\pm \\sqrt{(-62)^2-4(24)(-478)}}{2(24)}$$\n\n$$a=\\frac{62 \\pm \\sqrt{3844+46032}}{48}$$\n\n$$a=\\frac{62 \\pm \\sqrt{50476}}{48}$$\n\n$$a=\\frac{62 \\pm 224.04}{48}$$\n\nWe want the smallest positive value of $a$, so we take the smaller of the two solutions:\n\n$$a=\\frac{62-224.04}{48}$$\n\n$$a=\\frac{-162.04}{48}$$\n\n$$a=-3.375$$\n\nThis is not the answer that we are looking for. However, we can try to find the solution by factoring the original equation:\n\n$$0=24a^2-62a-478$$\n\n$$0=2a(12a-31)-1(12a-31)$$\n\n$$0=(2a-1)(12a-31)$$\n\n$$0=2a-1 \\text{ or } 0=12a-31$$\n\n$$a=\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ or } a=\\frac{31}{12}$$\n\n$$a=0.5 \\text{ or } a=2.5833$$\n\nSince we want the smallest positive value of $a$, we take the smaller of the two solutions:\n\n$$a=0.5$$\n\nHowever, we"
