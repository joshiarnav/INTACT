    "solution": "The line passing through the tangency point of the bottom left circle and the one to its right and through the tangency of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it is the line we are looking for: a line passing through the tangency of two circles cuts congruent areas, so our line cuts through the four aforementioned circles splitting into congruent areas, and there are an additional two circles on each side. The line passes through $\\left(1,\\frac 12\\right)$ and $\\left(\\frac 32,2\\right)$, which can be easily solved to be $6x = 2y + 5$. Thus, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = \\boxed{65}$.",

    "model_solution": "To begin with, we need to find the line that divides the given region into two equal areas. We know that the line has a slope of 3 and must pass through the centers of two circles, so we first need to find the coordinates of these centers.\n\nThe centers of the four circles in the bottom row are (1,1), (3,1), (1,3), and (3,3). The line passing through (1,1) and (3,3) has a slope of 1 and is not possible since the slope is 3. So we'll consider the line passing through (1,1) and (1,3). This line is vertical and cannot be our answer. \n\nThe same process must be applied to the other rows. For the second row, the centers of the circles are at (3,1), (3,3), (5,1), and (5,3). The line passing through (3,1) and (5,1) also has a slope of 0 and cannot be our answer.\n\nFor the third row, the centers of the circles are at (1,3), (3,3), (1,5), and (3,5). The line passing through (1,3) and (1,5) has a slope of 0, so we discard this possibility again.\n\nNow let's find the line passing through the centers (3,3) and (1,5). We can use the formula for the equation of a line: $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$. Plugging in the values of the two points, we get:\n\n$y-3=3(x-3)$\n\n$y-3=3x-9$\n\n$y=3x-6$\n\nWe have the equation of the line in the form $y = mx + c$, but we need it in the form $ax=by+c$ where $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers whose greatest common divisor is 1. \n\nWe multiply through by 2 to clear the fractions, getting $2y = 6x - 12.$ Now we have it in the desired form, so we can read off the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$: $a = 6,$ $b = 2,$ and $c = 12.$\n\nNow we need to find $a^2+b^2+c^2$. Substituting the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, we have:\n\n$a^2+b^2+c^2 = 6^2 + 2^2 + 12^2 = 36 + 4 + 144.$\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{184}$."
