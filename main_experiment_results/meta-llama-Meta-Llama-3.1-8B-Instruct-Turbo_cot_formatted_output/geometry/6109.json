    "problem": "A right circular cone has base radius $r$ and height $h$. The cone lies on its side on a flat table. As the cone rolls on the surface of the table without slipping, the point where the cone's base meets the table traces a circular arc centered at the point where the vertex touches the table. The cone first returns to its original position on the table after making $17$ complete rotations. The value of $h/r$ can be written in the form $m\\sqrt {n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n$.\n",
    "solution": "The path is a circle with radius equal to the slant height of the cone, which is $\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}}$. Thus, the length of the path is $2\\pi\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}}$.\nAlso, the length of the path is 17 times the circumference of the base, which is $34r\\pi$. Setting these equal gives $\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}} = 17r$, or $h^{2} = 288r^{2}$. Thus, $\\dfrac{h^{2}}{r^{2}} = 288$, and $\\dfrac{h}{r} = 12\\sqrt {2}$, giving an answer of $12 + 2 = \\boxed{14}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's consider the path traced by the point where the cone's base meets the table as it rolls on the surface of the table. This path forms a circle with a radius equal to the slant height of the cone, which can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem as $\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$.\n\nThe circumference of this circle is $2\\pi\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$. Since the cone returns to its original position after making 17 complete rotations, the circumference of the circle must be 17 times the circumference of the base of the cone.\n\nThe circumference of the base of the cone is $2\\pi r$. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n$2\\pi\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2} = 17(2\\pi r)$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2} = 17r$\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n$r^2 + h^2 = 289r^2$\n\nSubtracting $r^2$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$h^2 = 288r^2$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$h = 12\\sqrt{2}r$\n\nTherefore, the value of $h/r$ is $\\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{1} = 12\\sqrt{2}$. The answer is $12 + 2 = \\boxed{14}$."
