    "model_solution": "To find the area of the square, we need to find the length of its sides. Let's start by drawing a diagram and labeling the given information. \n\nSuppose the length of each side of the square is $x$. We can see that $\\triangle ABE$, $\\triangle DEF$, and $\\triangle FCB$ are all congruent right triangles.\n\nSince $BE=EF=FD=30$, we can see that the three right triangles have a leg of length $30$ and a hypotenuse of length $x$. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the other leg of the right triangle.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that for a right triangle with legs of length $a$ and $b$, and a hypotenuse of length $c$, we have $c^2=a^2+b^2$. In this case, we have $c=x$ and $a=30$. \n\nWe need to find $b$, which is the length of the other leg of the right triangle. However, we already know that the other leg is also $x$, because each side of the square is equal.\n\nSo, we can write the Pythagorean theorem as $x^2=30^2+x^2$. This is a quadratic equation in $x^2$, which simplifies to $x^2=900+x^2$. \n\nHowever, this simplification does not make sense as it seems to show that $900$ equals $0$. Let's go back and correct this step.\n\nThe correct approach is to consider the entire right triangle, with legs of length 30 and the hypotenuse of length x. Now we have a right triangle with a leg of length x and a hypotenuse of length x, and another leg of length 30. We can again apply the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nThe correct Pythagorean equation is: \n\n30^2 = x^2 - (x/2)^2\n\n30^2 = x^2 - (x^2/4)\n\n30^2 = (x^2 * 4 - x^2) / 4\n\n30^2 = (3x^2) / 4\n\nNow, we multiply both sides of this equation by 4.\n\n12000 = 3x^2\n\nNow we divide both sides by 3.\n\nx^2 = 4000\n\nThe length of one side of the square is the square root of 4000. \n\nSo, x = sqrt(4000).\n\nx = sqrt(4000) = sqrt(100 * 40) = 10 * sqrt(40) = 20 * sqrt(10)\n\nHowever, the instructions asked to keep it simple and answer in the box format. To simplify the answer further, we can assume that the problem wants the answer in the simplest radical form. \n\nSo, x = 20 * sqrt(10)\n\nThe area of the square is the square of the length of its side. \n\nThe area of the square is x^2 = (20 * sqrt(10))^2 = 400 * 10. \n\nThe area of the square is 4000."
