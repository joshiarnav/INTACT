    "problem": "A triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units. The length of the third side is $x$ units, where $x$ is an integer. What is the largest possible perimeter of the triangle?",
    "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to consider the triangle inequality theorem. According to this theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nLet's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, where a = 5 units, b = 6 units, and c = x units. \n\nWe know that:\n1. a + b > c\n2. a + c > b\n3. b + c > a\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of a and b into these inequalities:\n1. 5 + 6 > c\n2. 5 + c > 6\n3. 6 + c > 5\n\nWe can simplify these inequalities:\n1. 11 > c\n2. c > 1\n3. c > -1 (This inequality is always true for positive x, so we can ignore it.)\n\nFrom inequalities (1) and (2), we can conclude that 1 < c < 11.\n\nSince x is an integer, the possible values of x are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 units.\n\nTo maximize the perimeter, we need to find the largest possible value of x. Let's check the largest possible value of x, which is 10 units.\n\nNow, let's calculate the perimeter:\nPerimeter = a + b + c\n= 5 + 6 + 10\n= 21 units\n\nTherefore, the largest possible perimeter of the triangle is 21 units.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{21}$."
