The formula to find the area of a triangle given two sides $a$ and $b$ and the measure of the angle between them $\\theta$ is:\n\n$Area = \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin(\\theta)$\n\nHowever, we don't know $\\theta$. So, let's find the area using a different approach.\n\nConsider the line $OM$ that is drawn from $O$ to $C$. Since $C$ is on the circle, $OM$ is perpendicular to $CD$.\n\nNow, we can find the area of $\\triangle OMC$ and $\\triangle ABC$ using the formula:\n\n$Area = \\frac{1}{2}(base)(height)$\n\nLet's find the area of $\\triangle OMC$ first.\n\nSince $OM$ is perpendicular to $CD$ and $CD$ is the radius of the circle (because $AB$ is the diameter), $OM$ is the height of $\\triangle OMC$ and $CD=2$ is the base.\n\nSo, the area of $\\triangle OMC$ is:\n\n$Area_{OMC} = \\frac{1}{2}(2)(OC) = OC$\n\nNow, we can find the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nSince $OC$ is the height of $\\triangle ABC$ and $AB$ is the base, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is:\n\n$Area_{ABC} = \\frac{1}{2}(AB)(OC)$\n\nLet's find the area of $\\triangle OAD$ first to find the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nSince $OC$ is the height of $\\triangle OAD$ and $AD$ is the base, the area of $\\triangle OAD$ is:\n\n$Area_{OAD} = \\frac{1}{2}(AD)(OC)$\n\nUsing the formula for the area of a triangle and the given values:\n\n$Area_{OAD} = \\frac{1}{2}(AD)(OB)$\n\nSince $AB$ is the diameter, $AB=2r=4$.\n\n$OB=2$ (radius of the circle)\n\n$AD=5$\n\n$Area_{OAD} = \\frac{1}{2}(5)(2)=5$\n\nNow, we can find the area of $\\triangle OMC$:\n\n$Area_{OMC} = OC$\n\nSince $Area_{OMC} = OC$, we can find the value of $OC$ by using the similarity of $\\triangle OMC$ and $\\triangle OAD$.\n\n$\\frac{OC}{2} = \\frac{2}{5}$\n\n$OC = \\frac{4}{5}$\n\nNow, we can find the area of $\\triangle ABC$:\n\n$Area_{ABC} = \\frac{1}{2}(AB)(OC)$\n\n$Area_{ABC} = \\frac{1}{2}(4)(\\frac{4}{5})$\n\n$Area_{ABC} = \\frac{16}{5}$\n\nHowever, we need to use $OC$ in terms of the given values.\n\nWe can find the value of $OC$ by using the Pythagorean theorem in $\\triangle OCD$:\n\n$OC^2 + CD^2 = OD^2$\n\nSince $CD=2$ and $OD=5$, we can find the value of $OC$:\n\n$OC^2 + 4 = 25$\n\n$OC^2 = 21$\n\n$OC = \\sqrt{21}$\n\nNow, we can find the area of $\\triangle ABC$:\n\n$Area_{ABC} = \\frac{1}{2}(AB)(OC)$\n\n$Area_{ABC} = \\frac{1}{2}(4)(\\sqrt{21})$\n\n$Area_{ABC} = 2\\sqrt{21}$\n\nHowever, we still need to use the given values.\n\nWe can find the value of $OC$ by using the similarity of $\\triangle OMC$ and $\\triangle OAD$.\n\n$\\frac{OC}{2} = \\frac{2}{5}$\n\n$OC = \\frac{4}{5}$\n\nHowever, we need to find $OC$ in terms of the given values $AB=4$ and $ED=5$.\n\nWe can find the value of $OC$ by using the similarity of $\\triangle OMC$ and $\\triangle OAD$.\n\n$\\frac{OC}{2} = \\frac{2}{5}$\n\nHowever, this approach isn't helpful.\n\nWe can use the similar triangles $\\triangle AED$ and $\\triangle
