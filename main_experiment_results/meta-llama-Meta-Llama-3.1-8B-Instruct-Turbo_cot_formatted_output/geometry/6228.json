Draw $X$, where $X$ is on $BC$ and $AC \\parallel PX$. By AA Similarity, $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle PBX$, so $PX = 3an$, $BX = 4an$, and $CX = 4an - 4n$.\nAlso, let $\\angle ABC = a$ and $\\angle BAC = b$. Since the angles of a triangle add up to $180^{\\circ}$, $\\angle BCA = 180-a-b$. By Exterior Angle Theorem, $\\angle ACX = a+b$, and since $CP$ bisects $\\angle ACX$, $\\angle PCX = \\frac{a+b}{2}$. Because $AC \\parallel PX$, $\\angle BXP = 180 - a - b$. Thus, $\\angle CPX = \\frac{a+b}{2}$, making $\\triangle CPX$ an isosceles triangle.\nBecause $\\triangle CPX$ is isosceles, $PX = CX$, so $4an - 4n = 3an$. That means $a = 4$, so $PB = 4 \\cdot AB$. Thus, $PA = PB - AB = 3 \\cdot AB$, so $PA : AB = \\boxed{3:1}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Recall the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that if a line bisects the angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into two segments that are proportional to the other.\n\nStep 2: Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem to the given triangle. We know that the ratio $AC:CB$ is $3:4$. The bisector of the exterior angle at $C$ intersects $BA$ extended at $P$.\n\nStep 3: Let's label the intersection of the angle bisector with $AB$ as $D$. We can apply the Angle Bisector Theorem to triangle $ABC$, where $AD:DB = 3:4$.\n\nStep 4: The Angle Bisector Theorem also tells us that $PC: PB = 3:4$.\n\nStep 5: We can use the fact that $PC: PB = 3:4$ to find the ratio $PA:AB$. We can express $PA$ as $PC + PB$. So, we have $PA = 3x + 4x = 7x$ and $AB = DA = DB + AB = 4x + 3x = 7x$.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the ratio $PA:AB$ is $7x:7x$, which simplifies to $7:7$, and finally to $1:1$.\n\nHowever, our ratio is not listed and our answer doesn't match any of the options. We can try another approach, by using the Angle Bisector Theorem in a different way.\n\nStep 7: We know that $PA + PB = 4 \\times PC$.\n\nStep 8: Also, we know that $PA = PB + AB$.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, $PB + AB + PB = 4 \\times PC$. \n\nStep 10: Since $PB = PC - PB + PB$, the equation becomes $PB + AB + PB = 4 \\times PB + 3 PB$.\n\nStep 11: This simplifies to $2 PB + AB = 7 PB$.\n\nStep 12: The ratio $PA:AB$ can be written as $PB + AB : AB$, which simplifies to $7 PB : 3 PB$.\n\nStep 13: Therefore, the ratio $PA:AB$ is $\\boxed{7:3}$."
