    "problem": "Two points $A(x_1, y_1)$ and $B(x_2, y_2)$ are chosen on the graph of $f(x) = \\ln x$, with $0 < x_1 < x_2$. The points $C$ and $D$ trisect $\\overline{AB}$, with $AC < CB$. Through $C$ a horizontal line is drawn to cut the curve at $E(x_3, y_3)$. Find $x_3$ if $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 1000$.\n",
    "solution": "Since $C$ is the trisector of line segment $\\overline{AB}$ closer to $A$, the $y$-coordinate of $C$ is equal to two thirds the $y$-coordinate of $A$ plus one third the $y$-coordinate of $B$. Thus, point $C$ has coordinates $(x_0, \\frac{2}{3} \\ln 1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\ln 1000) = (x_0, \\ln 10)$ for some $x_0$. Then the horizontal line through $C$ has equation $y = \\ln 10$, and this intersects the curve $y = \\ln x$ at the point $(10, \\ln 10)$, so $x_3 = \\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find $x_3$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the coordinates of point C**: Since $C$ trisects $\\overline{AB}$, we can find its coordinates by taking two-thirds of the way from $A(1, 0)$ to $B(1000, \\ln 1000)$.\n\n   Let $C$ have coordinates $(x_c, y_c)$. Then we have:\n   \\[x_c = \\frac{2}{3}\\cdot 1000 + \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 1 = \\frac{2000}{3}\\]\n   \\[y_c = \\frac{2}{3}\\cdot \\ln 1000 + \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\ln 1\\]\n   \\[y_c = \\frac{2}{3}\\cdot \\ln 1000\\]\n\n2. **Find $y_c$ using logarithmic properties**: We know that $1000 = 10^3$, so $\\ln 1000 = \\ln (10^3) = 3 \\ln 10$. Plugging this back in, we get:\n   \\[y_c = \\frac{2}{3}\\cdot 3 \\ln 10\\]\n   \\[y_c = 2 \\ln 10\\]\n\n3. **Draw a horizontal line through C and find the intersection with the curve at E**: The horizontal line through $C$ will have the same $y$-coordinate as $C$, which is $y_c = 2 \\ln 10$. This line intersects the curve at point $E(x_3, y_3)$, where $y_3 = y_c = 2 \\ln 10$.\n\n4. **Solve for $x_3$ using the function**: Since $E$ lies on the curve of $f(x) = \\ln x$, we can write:\n   \\[\\ln x_3 = 2 \\ln 10\\]\n   Using the property of logarithms that $\\ln a^b = b \\ln a$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n   \\[\\ln x_3 = \\ln 10^2\\]\n   This implies that $x_3 = 10^2$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $x_3$ is: \n\n$\\boxed{100}$"
