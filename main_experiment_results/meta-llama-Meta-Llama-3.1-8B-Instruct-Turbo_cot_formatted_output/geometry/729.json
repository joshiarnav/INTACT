    "problem": "Amy and Belinda each roll a sheet of 6-inch by 8-inch paper to form a cylindrical tube. Amy tapes the two 8-inch sides together without overlap. Belinda tapes the two 6-inch sides together without overlap. What is $\\pi$ times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes?",
    "solution": "Amy's cylinder has a height of 8 and a base circumference of 6.  Let her cylinder have volume $V_A$ and radius $r_A$; we have $2\\pi r_A = 6$ so $r_A = 3/\\pi$ and $V_A = \\pi r_A ^2 h = \\pi (3/\\pi)^2 (8) = 72/\\pi$.\n\nBelinda's cylinder has a height of 6 and a base circumference of 8.  Similarly, let her cylinder have volume $V_B$ and radius $r_B$; we have $2\\pi r_B = 8$ so $r_B = 4/\\pi$ and $V_B = \\pi r_B^2 h = \\pi (4/\\pi)^2 (6) = 96/\\pi$.\n\nThe positive difference between the volume of the two tubes is $96/\\pi - 72/\\pi = 24/\\pi$ cubic inches; $\\pi$ times this difference is $\\boxed{24}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of each cylindrical tube, we need to calculate the radius of the cylinder first.\n\nFor Amy's tube, the 8-inch sides are taped together without overlap. So, when rolled, the diameter of the circular base will be 8 inches, making the radius 4 inches.\n\nFor Belinda's tube, the 6-inch sides are taped together without overlap. So, when rolled, the diameter of the circular base will be 6 inches, making the radius 3 inches.\n\nNow, let's find the volume of each tube. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nFor Amy's tube, the volume is V1 = \u03c0(4)\u00b2(6) = 96\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nFor Belinda's tube, the volume is V2 = \u03c0(3)\u00b2(8) = 72\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nThe positive difference between the two volumes is V1 - V2 = 96\u03c0 - 72\u03c0 = 24\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nFinally, we need to find \u03c0 times the positive difference of the two volumes, which is \u03c0 \u00d7 24\u03c0 = 24\u03c0\u00b2.\n\nHowever, the answer needs to be given in the box format."
