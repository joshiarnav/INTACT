    "problem": "The surface area of a particular sphere is $324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2.\\]  Solving for $r$ and keeping the positive value yields $r^2=81$, so $r = 9$.  Hence the volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=81\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\pi = \\boxed{972\\pi}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of the sphere, we first need to find its radius. \n\nThe surface area of a sphere is given by the formula $A = 4\\pi r^2$. \n\nGiven that the surface area is $324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$, we can set up an equation:\n\n$324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2$\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by $4\\pi$:\n\n$r^2 = \\frac{324\\pi}{4\\pi}$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$r^2 = 81$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n$r = 9$\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.\n\nSubstituting the value of $r$:\n\n$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (9)^3$\n\n$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (729)$\n\n$V = 972\\pi$\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is $972\\pi\\text{ cm}^3$."
