    "solution": "Let $BC = s$. We can see that $AD$ consists of the altitudes from $A$ and $D$ to $BC$, each of which has length $s\\sqrt{3}/2$. Thus, $AD = s\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, $AD\\div BC = s\\sqrt{3}/s = \\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve for $AD \\div BC$, let's consider the properties of the given equilateral triangles. \n\nIf the side length of an equilateral triangle is $s$, then the altitude of that equilateral triangle can be expressed as $\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. \n\nWe'll label the side length of triangle $ABC$ as $s$, and the side length of triangle $BCD$ will also be $s$ since both are equilateral triangles.\n\nWe can now calculate the altitude of triangle $ABC$ by expressing it as $\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nThe length $AD$, which is the sum of the altitudes of triangles $ABC$ and $BCD$, can be calculated as $s\\sqrt{3} + s\\sqrt{3} = 2s\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate $AD \\div BC$ by dividing the length $AD$ by the length $BC$, which is $s$. This can be expressed as: \n$\\frac{AD}{BC} = \\frac{2s\\sqrt{3}}{s} = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{3}}$"
