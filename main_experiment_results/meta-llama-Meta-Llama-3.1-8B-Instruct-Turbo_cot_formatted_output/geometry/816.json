    "problem": "A square sheet of paper has area $6 \\text{ cm}^2$. The front is white and the back is black. When the sheet is folded so that point $A$ rests on the diagonal as shown, the visible black area is equal to the visible white area. How many centimeters is $A$ from its original position? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the length of a leg of the black isosceles triangle.  Then the black area is $\\frac{1}{2}(x)(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x^2$.  The white area is $6-x^2$.  Solving $\\frac{1}{2}x^2=6-x^2$, we find $x^2=4$, so $x=2$.  The distance from A to its original position is the length of a hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs have length $x$.  Therefore, A is $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$ centimeters from its original position.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1:  Understand the given problem. We have a square sheet of paper with an area of $6 \\text{ cm}^2$. The front is white and the back is black. When the sheet is folded so that point $A$ rests on the diagonal, the visible black area is equal to the visible white area. Our goal is to find out how many centimeters $A$ is from its original position.\n\nStep 2:  Let's assume that the length of a leg of the black isosceles triangle formed after folding is $x$. The area of the black triangle is then given by $\\frac{1}{2}(x)(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x^2$. The area of the white portion is $6-x^2$.\n\nStep 3:  According to the problem, the visible black area is equal to the visible white area. This leads to the equation $\\frac{1}{2}x^2=6-x^2$.\n\nStep 4:  Solving the equation for $x^2$, we get $x^2=4$. This implies that $x=2$, which is the length of a leg of the black isosceles triangle.\n\nStep 5:  Since the total length of the diagonal is $x\\sqrt{2}$, the distance from $A$ to its original position is $x\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nStep 6:  Substituting the value of $x$ into the expression for the distance, we get $2\\sqrt{2}$ cm.\n\nTherefore, the distance from point $A$ to its original position is $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$ centimeters."
