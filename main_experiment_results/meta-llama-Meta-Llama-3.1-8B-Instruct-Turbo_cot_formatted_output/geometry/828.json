    "solution": "To make the $8$ triangles have the same area, the base must be divided into $8$ segments of length $1$ inch each.  Define points $A$, $B_0$, $B_1$, $B_2$, $B_3$, and $B_4$ as in the figure.  For $0\\leq k\\leq 3$, the perimeter $P(k)$ of triangle $A B_k B_{k+1}$ in inches is \\[\nP(k)=1+\\sqrt{10^2+k^2}+\\sqrt{10^2+(k+1)^2},\n\\]where each distance $A B_k$ is calculated by applying the Pythagorean theorem to right triangle $A B_0 B_k$.  Since $P(k)$ increases as $k$ increases, its largest value is $P(3)=1+\\sqrt{100+3^2}+\\sqrt{100+4^2}$, which to the nearest hundredth is $\\boxed{22.21}$ inches.

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to divide the triangle into 8 equal pieces and then find the greatest perimeter among the pieces.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the isosceles triangle. The area of a triangle is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. In this case, the base is 8 inches and the height is 10 inches.\n\nArea of the triangle $= \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times 10 = 40$ square inches.\n\nNow, we need to divide the triangle into 8 equal pieces. To do this, we will draw lines from the top vertex of the triangle to the base, dividing the triangle into 8 equal areas.\n\nSince there are 8 equal pieces, each piece will have an area of $\\frac{40}{8} = 5$ square inches.\n\nNow, we need to find the greatest perimeter among the 8 pieces. To do this, we need to consider each piece separately.\n\nLet's consider a piece with vertices $(0,0)$, $(x,0)$, $(4,10)$, and $(x,10-\\frac{5}{8})$. Here, $x$ represents the distance from the vertex $(0,0)$ to the point where the piece intersects the base.\n\nWe can find the perimeter of the piece by finding the lengths of its sides and adding them together. \n\nThe length of the base of the piece is $x$. The length of the side from $(x,0)$ to $(4,10)$ can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n$\\sqrt{(4-x)^2 + 10^2}$. The length of the side from $(x,10-\\frac{5}{8})$ to $(x,0)$ is $\\frac{5}{8}$.\n\nThe perimeter of the piece is $P = x + \\sqrt{(4-x)^2 + 100} + \\frac{5}{8}$.\n\nTo find the greatest perimeter, we need to maximize the perimeter with respect to $x$.\n\nWe can do this by taking the derivative of the perimeter with respect to $x$, setting it equal to zero, and solving for $x$.\n\nHowever, this approach is complex and time-consuming.\n\nInstead, we can use the fact that the triangle is isosceles and the base is 8 inches. This means that the pieces will be symmetrical and the piece with the greatest perimeter will be the piece in the middle.\n\nThis piece will have a base of 1 inch and a height of 10 inches. The other two sides of the piece will be equal to the side of the original triangle.\n\nThe length of the side from $(4,10)$ to $(4.5,0)$ can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n$\\sqrt{(4.5-4)^2 + 10^2} = \\sqrt{0.25 + 100} = \\sqrt{100.25}$.\n\nThe perimeter of the piece is $P = 1 + \\sqrt{100.25} + \\sqrt{100.25}$.\n\n$P \\approx 1 + 10.02 + 10.02$\n\n$P \\approx 21.04$ inches.\n\nTherefore, the greatest perimeter among the 8 pieces is approximately 21.04 inches. \n\nHowever, we want the answer rounded to the nearest hundredth of an inch. So, we round 21.04 to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThe greatest perimeter among the 8 pieces is $\\boxed{21.04}$ inches."
