    "model_solution": "To find the greatest and least possible integral values of $x$, we first need to apply the triangle inequality, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nIn this triangle, the two fixed sides are 5 and 6. Therefore, we can set up the following inequalities:\n\n- $5 + 6 > x$\n- $5 + x > 6$\n- $6 + x > 5$\n\nSimplifying the inequalities, we get:\n\n- $11 > x$\n- $x > 1$\n- $x > -1$\n\nSince $x$ must be a positive length, we can ignore the inequality $x > -1$ and consider only $x > 1$ and $11 > x$.\n\nThe greatest possible integral value of $x$ is 10 (the largest integer less than 11), and the least possible integral value of $x$ is 2 (the smallest integer greater than 1).\n\nThe positive difference between the greatest and least possible integral values of $x$ is $10 - 2 = 8.$ \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{8}$."
