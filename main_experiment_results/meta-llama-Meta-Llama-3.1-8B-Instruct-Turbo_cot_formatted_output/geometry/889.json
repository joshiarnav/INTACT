    "solution": "Because the figure has rotational symmetry, $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$. Consequently, the triangles $BZQ$ and $BWQ$ have the same area because they share a height and have bases that are the same length.

    "model_solution": "To find the area of triangle $BQW$, we need to find the area of trapezoid $BQWD$ and then subtract the area of triangle $BZQ$. \n\nTo find the area of trapezoid $BQWD$, we can use the given information that the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is 120 square units and the height of both trapezoids is the same since they share the same rectangle $ABCD$.\n\nLet's find the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ as the sum of the areas of two smaller trapezoids, $ZWCD$ and $ZQWD$. Since the two smaller trapezoids have the same height and $ZW=ZQ$, the difference of the areas between the two trapezoids is the area of rectangle $BQWD$.\n\nSince $AB=12$ units and $AZ=WC=6$ units, the height of the trapezoids is 14 units, and the height of triangle $BZQ$ is 14 units. Now we can find the lengths of the bases of trapezoids $ZWCD$ and $ZQWD$. Since $ZW=WC$, it follows that $ZW=WC=6$ units, and the length of the base of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is $14+6=20$ units. Since the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is 120 square units, and the height of the trapezoid is 14 units, the length of the other base of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is $120/14=60/7$ units.\n\nSince the length of $QD$ is the difference of the lengths of $ZW$ and $ZQ$, $QD=(60/7)-6$ units. The area of rectangle $BQWD$ is $12*(60/7-6)$ square units.\n\nNow we can find the area of triangle $BZQ$. The base of triangle $BZQ$ is $ZB=12$ units and the height of triangle $BZQ$ is 6 units. The area of triangle $BZQ$ is $(12*6)/2$ square units.\n\nThe area of triangle $BQW$ is the area of rectangle $BQWD$ minus the area of triangle $BZQ$. \n\nLet's now substitute the values we know and find the area of triangle $BQW$: \n\nThe area of rectangle $BQWD$ is $12*(60/7-6)$. \n\nThe area of triangle $BZQ$ is $(12*6)/2$.\n\nThe area of triangle $BQW$ is $12*(60/7-6)- (12*6)/2$ square units.\n\n$12*(60/7-6)- (12*6)/2=12*(60/7-6)- (12*6)/2=12*(60/7-42/7)- (12*6)/2=12*(18/7)- (12*6)/2=216/7-72/1=216/7-72*7/7=216/7-504/7=-288/7$."
