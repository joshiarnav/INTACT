    "problem": "A round pizza is $\\frac13$ of an inch thick and has a diameter of 12 inches. It is cut into 12 congruent pieces. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one piece? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "The entire pizza has radius 6 inches and volume $\\pi (6^2)(1/3) = 12\\pi$ cubic inches.  One slice has 1/12th this volume, or $\\boxed{\\pi}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of one piece of the pizza, we need to find the length of the radius, the height of the pizza, and then calculate the volume of the entire pizza and divide it by 12 to get the volume of one piece.\n\n1. **Diameter of the pizza**: Given as 12 inches. \n\n2. **Radius of the pizza**: Diameter is twice the radius. So, radius = diameter / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6 inches.\n\n3. **Height of the pizza**: Given as $\\frac13$ of an inch thick.\n\n4. **Volume of one piece**: To find the volume of one piece of the pizza, we first need to find the volume of the entire pizza. \n\n   - The formula to find the volume of a cylinder is: V = \u03c0r\u00b2h\n   - Here, r is the radius and h is the height.\n   - Substituting the values, we get V = \u03c0(6)\u00b2($\\frac13$) = \u03c0(36)($\\frac13$) = 12\u03c0\n\n5. **Volume of one piece of the pizza**: Since the pizza is cut into 12 congruent pieces, we need to divide the volume of the entire pizza by 12 to get the volume of one piece.\n   - Volume of one piece = Total volume / 12 = 12\u03c0 / 12 = \u03c0\n\nSo, the volume of one piece of the pizza is $\\boxed{\\pi}$."
