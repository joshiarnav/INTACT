    "model_solution": "To compute $\\cos 240^\\circ$, we can use the unit circle and the properties of cosine function.\n\nStep 1: Recall that the unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1 centered at the origin of the coordinate plane. The point on the unit circle corresponding to an angle of $\\theta$ has coordinates $(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$.\n\nStep 2: Since we are interested in $\\cos 240^\\circ$, we need to find the point on the unit circle corresponding to an angle of $240^\\circ$.\n\nStep 3: To find this point, we can use the following steps:\n- Start at the point (1,0) on the unit circle, which corresponds to an angle of $0^\\circ$.\n- Rotate the point counterclockwise by $90^\\circ$ to get a point with coordinates (-1,0). This point corresponds to an angle of $90^\\circ$.\n- Rotate the point counterclockwise by another $90^\\circ$ to get a point with coordinates (0,-1). This point corresponds to an angle of $180^\\circ$.\n- Rotate the point counterclockwise by another $90^\\circ$ to get a point with coordinates (-1,0). This point corresponds to an angle of $270^\\circ$.\n- Rotate the point counterclockwise by another $90^\\circ$ to get a point with coordinates (0,1). This point corresponds to an angle of $360^\\circ$.\n- However, we want an angle of $240^\\circ$, which is $60^\\circ$ more than $180^\\circ$ and $120^\\circ$ more than $120^\\circ$, or equivalently, $60^\\circ$ less than $300^\\circ$.\n- However, if we rotate the point (0,1) counterclockwise by $60^\\circ$, the point will be at $\\cos240^\\circ$.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Recall that a rotation of a point $(x,y)$ by an angle of $\\theta$ counterclockwise in the coordinate plane results in a point with coordinates $(x\\cos\\theta-y\\sin\\theta, x\\sin\\theta+y\\cos\\theta)$.\n\nStep 5: In our case, we need to rotate the point (0,1) counterclockwise by $60^\\circ$.\n- Since we are given the angle $60^\\circ$ we can then apply the formula\n$$(x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta, x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta)$$\nwhere the given angle $\\theta$ is $60^\\circ$ and the point $(x,y)$ is $(0,1)$.\n\n\nStep 6: We know that $\\cos60^\\circ=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\sin60^\\circ=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n- Now we can calculate the coordinates of the rotated point.\n- The x-coordinate of the rotated point is $(0\\cos60^\\circ - 1\\sin60^\\circ) = (0\\cdot\\frac{1}{2} - 1\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n- The y-coordinate of the rotated point is $(0\\sin60^\\circ + 1\\cos60^\\circ) = (0\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + 1\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n\n\nSo, the point with coordinates $\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ corresponds to an angle of $240^\\circ$ on the unit circle.\n\nTherefore, we have $\\cos 240^\\circ = \\boxed{-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$."
