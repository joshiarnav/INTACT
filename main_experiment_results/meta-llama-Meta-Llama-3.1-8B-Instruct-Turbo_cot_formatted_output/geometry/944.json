    "problem": "In trapezoid $ABCD$, the parallel sides $AB$ and $CD$ have lengths of 8 and 20 units, respectively, and the altitude is 12 units. Points $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of sides $AD$ and $BC$, respectively. What is the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ in square units?",
    "solution": "Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, quadrilateral $EFCD$ is a trapezoid with half the altitude of the original trapezoid (the altitude of trapezoid $EFCD$ is $12/2 = 6$). The length of base $CD$ is still $20$, but now we have to find the length of base $EF$. Since $EF$ connects the midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, its length is also the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$. Thus, $EF$ has length $\\frac{8+20}{2} = 14$. Finally, we can find the area of the trapezoid with the formula $\\text{Area} = a \\left(\\frac{b_1+b_2}{2}\\right)$ where $a$ is the altitude and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases. The area of trapezoid $EFCD $ is $6 \\left(\\frac{14+20}{2}\\right)=6 \\cdot 17 = \\boxed{102}$ square units.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$, we need to first find the lengths of its bases and altitude. \n\n1. **Length of base $CD$**: Given as 20 units.\n\n2. **Length of base $EF$**: The trapezoid is divided into two trapezoids by the midpoint line $EF$. The first trapezoid is $ABEF$ and the second one is $EFCD$. The trapezoid $ABEF$ is similar to the original trapezoid and the bases of the first trapezoid are $\\frac{AB + CD}{2} = \\frac{8 + 20}{2} = 14$ and the base of $EFCD$ is 20. Since the altitude of trapezoid $ABEF$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the original trapezoid, it is 6. \n\nNow we need to find the length of base $EF$ using the area of trapezoid $ABEF$: \n$Area = \\frac{1}{2} * (14+14) * 6$\nThis calculation is now incorrect. Area = $\\frac{1}{2} * (14+8) * 6$ is the correct formula. \nThis calculation is now correct and yields 102.\n\n3. **Area of trapezoid $ABEF$**: $\\frac{1}{2} * (14+8) * 6 = 102$\n\n4. **Area of trapezoid $EFCD$**: The total area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $\\frac{1}{2} * (8 + 20) * 12 = 168$. The area of trapezoid $EFCD$ is $168 - 102 = \\boxed{66}$."
