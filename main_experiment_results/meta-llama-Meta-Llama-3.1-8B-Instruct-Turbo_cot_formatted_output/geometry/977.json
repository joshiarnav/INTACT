    "problem": "The corner of a unit cube is chopped off such that the cut runs through the three vertices adjacent to the vertex of the chosen corner.  What is the height of the remaining cube when the freshly-cut face is placed on a table?",
    "solution": "The major diagonal has a length of $\\sqrt{3}$.  The volume of the pyramid is $1/6$, and so its height $h$ satisfies $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot h\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(\\sqrt{2})^2=1/6$ since  the freshly cut face is an equilateral triangle of side length $\\sqrt{2}$.  Thus $h=\\sqrt{3}/3$, and the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Visualize the Cube**: A unit cube has three dimensions: length (L), width (W), and height (H). All these dimensions are equal to 1 unit.\n\n2. **Identify the Corner**: Imagine a corner of the cube where the cut will be made. Let's call this corner the top-right-front corner (assuming the cube is oriented with its vertices at the origin of a 3D coordinate system). The three adjacent vertices are the top-right-back, bottom-right-front, and top-left-front vertices.\n\n3. **Determine the Cut**: The cut will run through the top-right-back, bottom-right-front, and top-left-front vertices. This means it will cut off a triangular pyramid from the cube.\n\n4. **Find the Volume of the Cut Pyramid**: The cut pyramid has vertices at the top-right-back, bottom-right-front, and top-left-front corners. These vertices form a right triangle. The cut pyramid is also similar to the original cube. The volume of a pyramid is given by V = 1/3 * base_area * height. The base area of the cut pyramid is a right triangle with legs of length 1/2 (since the cut is made through the vertices adjacent to the chosen corner) and 1/2. Therefore, the base area is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. The height of the cut pyramid is 1 (since it extends from the top to the bottom of the cube). However, because it was cut off, we first find its volume as 1/3*1/4*1=1/12. Knowing this, the volume of the cube is 1. Since 1 - 1/12 is 7/12, the volume of the remaining part is 7/12 of the cube.\n\n5. **Find the Height of the Remaining Cube**: The volume of the remaining cube (V) is 7/12 of the original cube. Since the volume of a cube is V = L^3, where L is the length of the side, we can set up a proportion: (V_remaining / V_original) = (L_remaining / L_original)^3. Since the volume is 7/12, we can write (7/12) = (L_remaining / 1)^3. To find the height of the remaining cube, we need to find L_remaining.\n\n6. **Solve for L_remaining**: To solve for L_remaining, we take the cube root of both sides of the equation. L_remaining = (7/12)^(1/3).\n\n7. **Calculate L_remaining**: Now, we need to calculate the cube root of (7/12). \n\nTo find the numerical value, I can calculate (7/12)^(1/3) \u2248 0.9083."
