    "solution": "At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{2}{3}(360^\\circ)=240$ degrees.  Every minute, the minute hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}(360^\\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12} (360^\\circ)=0.5$ degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.  After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\\circ-5.5^\\circ\\cdot 15=\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of degrees in the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock at 8:15, we need to calculate the position of both hands in terms of degrees.\n\n1. The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which is equivalent to 30 degrees per hour. Since it is 8:15, the hour hand will be between the 8 and the 9. To calculate its position, we first find the position at 8:00, which is $8 \\times 30 = 240$ degrees. Then, we add the additional movement for 15 minutes. Since the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees per minute, it moves $15 \\times 0.5 = 7.5$ degrees in 15 minutes. Therefore, the hour hand is at $240 + 7.5 = 247.5$ degrees.\n\n2. The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which is equivalent to 6 degrees per minute. At 8:15, it will be at $15 \\times 6 = 90$ degrees.\n\n3. Since the hour hand is at 247.5 degrees and the minute hand is at 90 degrees, we need to find the smaller angle between them. To do this, we find the larger angle first by subtracting the smaller angle from the larger angle: $247.5 - 90 = 157.5$ degrees.\n\nTherefore, the smaller angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at 8:15 is $\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees."
