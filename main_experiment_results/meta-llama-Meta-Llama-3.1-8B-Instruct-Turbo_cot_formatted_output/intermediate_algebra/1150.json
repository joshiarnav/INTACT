    "model_solution": "To find the monic quadratic polynomial with real coefficients, we need to consider the complex conjugate of the given root.\n\nStep 1: The complex conjugate of $-2 - i \\sqrt{5}$ is $-2 + i \\sqrt{5}$. This is because the complex conjugate of a number is obtained by changing the sign of its imaginary part.\n\nStep 2: A monic quadratic polynomial can be written in the form $(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the roots of the polynomial.\n\nStep 3: Plugging in the given root and its complex conjugate, we get the polynomial as $(x - (-2 - i\\sqrt{5}))(x - (-2 + i\\sqrt{5}))$.\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the polynomial, we get $(x + 2 + i\\sqrt{5})(x + 2 - i\\sqrt{5})$.\n\nStep 5: Using the difference of squares formula, we can expand this as $(x + 2)^2 - (i\\sqrt{5})^2$.\n\nStep 6: Simplifying further, we get $x^2 + 4x + 4 - (i^2)(\\sqrt{5})^2$.\n\nStep 7: Since $i^2 = -1$, we have $x^2 + 4x + 4 + 5$.\n\nStep 8: Combining like terms, we get the final polynomial $x^2 + 4x + 9$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{x^2 + 4x + 9}$"
