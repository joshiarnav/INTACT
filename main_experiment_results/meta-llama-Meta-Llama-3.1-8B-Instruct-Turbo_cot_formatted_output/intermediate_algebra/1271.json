    "model_solution": "To find the sum of all possible values of $f(30),$ we need to determine the possible values of $f(2)$ and $f(5)$ since $30 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5.$\n\nFrom (iii), we have $2^4 \\ne 4^2.$ However, we know from basic number theory that $2^4 = 16$ and $4^2 = 16.$ Since $2^4=4^2,$ the $f(2) =4$ or $f(4)=2.$ Either way, $f(2) =4$ and $f(4)=2.$\n\nNow, we consider $2^3=8$ and $3^2=9.$ From (ii), we know that $f(2^3) = f(2)^3$ and $f(3^2) = f(3)^2.$  Since we have already determined that $f(2)=4,$ we have that $f(8) = 4^3=64.$ Now we need to find $f(3).$\n\nNow let $n$ be a positive integer, and let $m$ be a positive integer greater than $n.$ We will now show that $f(m) > f(n).$ Since $f$ is increasing, we have $f(m) > f(n + 1) > \\dots > f(m).$ Because $f$ is increasing, we know $f(m) > f(n).$\n\nSince $f$ is increasing, we have $f(2)<f(3).$ Since $f(3) < f(4),$ we have that $f(3) \\ge 5.$ Because $f$ is increasing, we have that $f(4) > f(3).$ Because $f(4) = 2,$ we have that $f(3) < 2.$ Therefore, we know that $f(3) =5.$\n\nNow, we need to find the possible values of $f(2^2)$ and $f(2^3).$ Since we have already determined that $f(2)=4,$ we have that $f(2^2) = f(2)^2 = 4^2 = 16$ and $f(2^3) = f(2)^3 = 4^3 = 64.$\n\nNow, we have found that $f(2) =4$ and $f(3) =5.$ We need to find $f(5).$ We know from (i) that $f$ is increasing, so we have that $f(4) < f(5) < f(6).$ Because $f(4)=2$ and $f(6) \\ge 3^2 = 9,$ we have that $f(5) \\in \\{7,8,9\\}.$\n\nNow, we have found that $f(5) \\in \\{7,8,9\\}$ and $f(2) =4.$ We know from (ii) that $f(2 \\times 5) = f(2) \\times f(5),$ so we have that $f(10) \\in \\{28,32,36,40,45,56,64,72,80\\}.$\n\nNow, we will consider the different possible values of $f(10).$ We have the following cases:\n\nCase 1: $f(10) < 64.$\nIn this case, $f(10) \\in \\{28,32,36,40,45,56\\}.$ Because $f(2 \\times 5) = f(2) \\times f(5),$ we have that $f(2 \\times 5^2) = f(2) \\times f(5^2),$ so we have $f(10^2) \\in \\{196,256,324,400,450,784\\}.$ We also know that $f(10^2) = f(10)^2,$ so we have $f(10)^2 \\in \\{196,256,324,400,450,784\\}.$ Since $f(10)^2 \\ge f(10),$ we have $f(10)^2 \\in \\{784,256,324,400,450,784\\},$ but we are also given that $f(10) \\in \\{28,32,36,40,45,56\\},$ so $f(10)^2 \\in \\{784,256,324,400,450,784\\}$ and $f(10) \\in \\{28,32,36,40,45,56\\}.$ We can now try to find the possible values of $f(10^3).$ We know that $f(10^3) = f(10) \\times f(10^2) = f(10) \\times f(10)^2.$ We also know from (ii) that $f(10^3) = f(10^2 \\times 10) = f(10^2) \\times f(10),$ so we have $f(10)^2 \\times f(10) = f(10) \\times f(10)^2.$ We can now cancel out $f(10)^2$ from both sides to get $f(10) = f(10).$ This is a contradiction, so we can conclude that there is no solution in this case.\n\nCase 2: $f(10) = 64.$\nIn this case, we have $f(5) = 16$ and $f(2) = 4.$ We can now try to find $f(3).$ Since $f(3) < f(4),$ we have that $f(3) < 2.$ Since $f(3) > f(2),$ we have that $f(3) > 4,$ which is a contradiction. This means that there is no solution in this case.\n\nCase 3: $f(10) > 64.$\nIn this case, we have $f(10) \\in \\{72,80\\}.$ We know from (ii) that $f(10 \\times 3) = f(10) \\times f(3),$ so we have $f(30) \\in \\{216,240,240,320\\}.$ Since $f(3) = 5,$ we have that $f(30) \\in \\{216,240\\}.$\n\nNow, we have found the possible values of $f(30).$ We can now find the sum of all possible values of $f(30).$\n\nThe sum of all possible values of $f(30)$ is $216+240=\\boxed{456}.$"
