    "solution": "From the given information we know that $|a| |b| = |ab| = 2\\sqrt{26}$. We can also write $|ab| = |t-2i| = \\sqrt{t^2 + 4}$. Setting these equal, we have $$\\sqrt{t^2 + 4} = 2\\sqrt{26} \\Rightarrow\nt^2 + 4 = 104.$$The positive answer is $t = \\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can start by using the given information that $|a|=2$ and $|b|=\\sqrt{26}$. Recall that $|a|$ represents the magnitude of $a$.\n\nWe are given $ab = t-2i$. \n\nWe can use the fact that the magnitude of a product of complex numbers is the product of their magnitudes: \n$|ab| = |a||b|$\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get: \n$|ab| = 2\\sqrt{26}$\n\nNow, let's express $ab$ as a complex number: \n$ab = t - 2i$\n\nThe magnitude of $ab$ can be calculated using the formula:\n$|ab| = \\sqrt{t^2 + (-2)^2}$\n\nNow we can equate the two expressions for $|ab|$:\n$\\sqrt{t^2 + 4} = 2\\sqrt{26}$\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n$t^2 + 4 = 104$\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides:\n$t^2 = 100$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n$t = \\pm 10$\n\nWe are asked for the positive value of $t$, so:\n$t = \\boxed{10}$"
