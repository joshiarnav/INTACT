    "problem": "A sequence $a_1$, $a_2$, $\\ldots$ of non-negative integers is defined by the rule $a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n|$ for $n\\geq1$. If $a_1=999$, $a_2<999$, and $a_{2006}=1$, how many different values of $a_2$ are possible?",
    "solution": "The condition $a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n|$ implies that $a_n$ and $a_{n+3}$ have the same parity for all $n\\geq 1$. Because $a_{2006}$ is odd, $a_2$ is also odd.  Because $a_{2006}=1$ and $a_n$ is a multiple of $\\gcd(a_1,a_2)$ for all $n$, it follows that $1=\\gcd(a_1,a_2)=\\gcd(3^3\\cdot 37,a_2)$. There are 499 odd integers in the interval $[1,998]$, of which 166 are multiples of 3, 13 are multiples of 37, and 4 are multiples of $3\\cdot 37=111$. By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the number of possible values of $a_2$ cannot exceed $499-166-13+4=\\boxed{324}$.\n\nTo see that there are actually 324 possibilities, note that for $n\\geq 3$, $a_n<\\max(a_{n-2},a_{n-1})$ whenever $a_{n-2}$ and $a_{n-1}$ are both positive.  Thus $a_N=0$ for some $N\\leq 1999$. If $\\gcd(a_1,a_2)=1$, then $a_{N-2}=a_{N-1}=1$, and for $n>N$ the sequence cycles through the values 1, 1, 0.  If in addition $a_2$ is odd, then $a_{3k+2}$ is odd for $k\\geq 1$, so $a_{2006}=1$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's first understand the sequence definition: $a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n|$ for $n\\geq1$. \n\nWe are given that $a_1=999$, $a_2<999$, and $a_{2006}=1$. \n\nStep 1: Analyze the initial values of the sequence. We start with $a_1=999$ and $a_2<999$.\n\nStep 2: To find $a_3$, we apply the rule $a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n|$, which gives us $a_3 = |a_2 - a_1|$. \n\nSince $a_2 < 999$ and $a_1 = 999$, $a_2$ must be less than or equal to 998 to have a non-zero $a_3$ value.\n\nStep 3: Observe the pattern as we calculate more terms in the sequence. \n\nAssume $a_2 = x$. \n\nThen, the $a_3$ would be $|x - 999|$. \n\nGiven that $a_{2006} = 1$, we need to consider how this value can be achieved from the initial conditions $a_1$ and $a_2$ after 2005 steps.\n\nStep 4: To simplify the problem, let's consider the pattern of the sequence and how it relates to $a_{2006} = 1$.\n\nNotice that any term $a_n$ can be written as $a_n = |a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}|$. \n\nStep 5: We need to express the second to last term ($a_{2005}$) in terms of $a_1$ and $a_2$.\n\nWe can express $a_{2005}$ as $a_{2005} = |a_{2004} - a_{2003}|$.\n\nContinuing this pattern until we reach $a_{2004}$ and $a_{2005}$ in terms of $a_1$ and $a_2$, we will get a long expression.\n\nTo simplify this, we can observe the pattern of the sequence.\n\nFor any two consecutive terms ($a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$), if their absolute difference is less than 1, then their absolute differences will eventually decrease to 1 after some number of steps.\n\nStep 6: Since we need $a_{2006} = 1$, the absolute difference between $a_{2005}$ and $a_{2004}$ must be less than 1.\n\nThis implies that the absolute difference between $a_{2003}$ and $a_{2002}$ must be less than 1.\n\nContinuing this pattern, we eventually get that the absolute difference between $a_4$ and $a_3$ must be less than 1.\n\nStep 7: Given that $a_3$ can be at most 998 (as calculated earlier), and the absolute difference between $a_3$ and $a_4$ must be less than 1, $a_4$ can be at most 997.\n\nStep 8: Continuing this pattern, we can deduce that $a_4$ can be at most 997, $a_5$ can be at most 996, and so on.\n\nStep 9: From these observations, we can derive a general condition for $a_2$.\n\nStep 10: Since the value of $a_2$ must be less than or equal to 998 (as calculated earlier), and the conditions for the $a_i$ values imply that $a_2$ must be greater than or equal to 3 (as in the case of $a_4$), we can find the valid range for $a_2$.\n\nGiven these constraints and conditions, the valid values of $a_2$ are integers from 3 to 498.\n\nStep 11: Now, we can count the number of different possible values of $a_2$ within this valid range.\n\nAnswer:  $ \\boxed{496}$!"
