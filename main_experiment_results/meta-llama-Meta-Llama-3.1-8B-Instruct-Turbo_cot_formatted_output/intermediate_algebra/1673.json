    "problem": "If $a$ is a nonzero integer and $b$ is a positive number such that $ab^2=\\log_{10} b$, what is the median of the set $\\{0, 1, a, b,\n1/b\\}$?",
    "solution": "Because $b<10^b$ for all $b>0$, it follows that $\\log_{10}b<b$.  If $b\\geq 1$, then $0<\\left(\\log_{10}b\\right)/b^2<1$, so $a$ cannot be an integer. Therefore $0<b<1$, so $\\log_{10}b<0$ and $a =\n\\left(\\log_{10}b\\right)/b^2<0$.  Thus $a<0<b<1<1/b$, and the median of the set is $\\boxed{b}$.\n\nNote that the conditions of the problem can be met with $b = 0.1$ and $a = -100$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the median of the set $\\{0, 1, a, b, 1/b\\}$, we need to first understand the properties of the numbers involved and their relationships. \n\nGiven the equation $ab^2=\\log_{10} b$, we know that $b$ is a positive number, and since the logarithm of a number is only defined for positive numbers, this equation holds true for all $b > 0$. \n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of $b$.\n\nSince $b > 0$, $\\log_{10} b$ is also real, and because the logarithm function is increasing, $\\log_{10} b > \\log_{10} 1 = 0$. This implies that $ab^2 > 0$.\n\nWe can divide both sides of the equation by $b^2$ to get $a = \\frac{\\log_{10} b}{b^2}$. \n\nSince we want to find the median of the set $\\{0, 1, a, b, 1/b\\}$, let's consider the possible values of $a$.\n\nIf $b>1$, then $b^2 > b$, and $\\log_{10} b$ is positive. Therefore, $\\frac{\\log_{10} b}{b^2}$ is positive, and we have $a > 0$.\n\nIf $b<1$, then $b^2 < b$, and $\\log_{10} b$ is negative. Therefore, $\\frac{\\log_{10} b}{b^2}$ is negative, and we have $a < 0$.\n\nIn the case where $b=1$, we have $a=\\frac{\\log_{10} 1}{1^2}$. Since $\\log_{10} 1 = 0$, we get $a=0$.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that $a$ is a nonzero integer, which rules out the possibility of $a=0$. \n\nTherefore, the only possible values for $a$ are positive or negative integers, depending on whether $b>1$ or $b<1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the set $\\{0, 1, a, b, 1/b\\}$. \n\nSince $0$ is the smallest element in the set, we know that $0 \\le b \\le 1$. \n\nIf $b=1$, then we have $a=0$, which is not allowed since $a$ is nonzero. \n\nIf $b<1$, then we have $a<0$, and since $a$ is an integer, we must have $a=-1$.\n\nIf $b>1$, then we have $a>0$, and since $a$ is an integer, we must have $a=1$.\n\nIn both cases, we have $a$ being either $-1$ or $1$. \n\nTherefore, the possible values for the set are $\\{-1, 0, 1, b, 1/b\\}$ or $\\{1, 0, -1, b, 1/b\\}$.\n\nSince $b>0$, we know that $1/b$ is also positive.\n\nIf $b<1$, then we know that $b<1/b$, since $b>0$.\n\nIf $b>1$, then we know that $1/b<1/b$, since $b>0$.\n\nIn both cases, we know that $1/b$ is either less than or equal to $b$. \n\nHowever, if $b>1$, then $b<1/b$, and if $b<1$, then $b>1/b$. \n\nIn both cases, we can conclude that the order of the set is either $\\{-1, 0, 1, b, 1/b\\}$ or $\\{1, 0, -1, b, 1/b\\}$.\n\nIn both cases, the median of the set is $\\boxed{1}$."
