    "solution": "We can obtain the graph of $y = g(x)$ by taking the graph of $y = f(x)$ and stretching it horizontally by a factor of 2, then shifting it down by 4 units.

    "model_solution": "We need to find the ordered triple $(a,b,c)$ such that $g(x) = af(bx) + c$.\n\nLooking at the graph of $y = g(x)$, it appears to be a horizontal stretch of the graph of $y = f(x)$ by a factor of $2$.  Therefore, we must have $b = 1/2$.\n\nThe horizontal stretch also indicates that the function $g(x)$ is obtained from $f(x)$ by replacing $x$ with $2x$, or $x/2$.  Hence, $af(x/2)$ is obtained by stretching the graph of $f(x)$ horizontally by a factor of $2$.  However, since the graph of $f(x)$ is also shifted downward by $4$ units, we must have $c = -4$.\n\nTo find the value of $a$, we can note that the graph of $y = g(x)$ passes through the point $(0, -4)$.  Substituting this into the equation $g(x) = af(bx) + c$, we get $g(0) = a\\cdot f(0) + c$, or $-4 = a\\cdot f(0) - 4$.  Solving for $a$, we find that $a = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the ordered triple $(a, b, c)$ is $(1, 1/2, -4)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(1, 1/2, -4)}$."
