    "model_solution": "To find $|z|$, we can use the fact that $|z^2| = |z|^2$. \n\nGiven $z^2 = 24-32i$, we need to find the magnitude of this complex number.\n\nThe magnitude of a complex number $a+bi$ is given by $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. \n\nIn this case, $a = 24$ and $b = -32$.\n\nSo, $|z^2| = |24-32i| = \\sqrt{24^2 + (-32)^2} = \\sqrt{576 + 1024} = \\sqrt{1600} = 40$.\n\nSince $|z^2| = |z|^2$, we have $|z|^2 = 40$. \n\nTo find $|z|$, we take the square root of both sides: $|z| = \\sqrt{40} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{40}}$.\n\nHowever, $\\sqrt{40}$ simplifies to $2\\sqrt{10}$.\n\nBut if we should evaluate the numerical value of it, we get $2\\sqrt{10} \\approx 6.32456$. \n\nHowever, since the answer needs to be in box format and $\\sqrt{40}$ simplifies to $2\\sqrt{10}$, we'll put the simplified version in the box format. \n\n$\\boxed{2\\sqrt{10}}$"
