    "problem": "A parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is reflected about the $x$-axis. The parabola and its reflection are translated horizontally five units in opposite directions to become the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$, respectively. Which of the following describes the graph of $y=(f+g)(x)$?\n\n(A) a parabola tangent to the $x$-axis\n(B) a parabola not tangent to the $x$-axis\n(C) a horizontal line\n(D) a non-horizontal line\n(E) the graph of a cubic function",
    "solution": "Write the equation of the original parabola as $y = a(x - h)^2 + k,$ where $a \\neq 0.$  Then the equation of the reflected parabola is\n\\[y = -a(x - h)^2 - k.\\]When the parabolas are translated horizontally by 5 units, in opposite directions, their equations become\n\\[y = a(x - h \\pm 5)^2 + k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -a(x - h \\mp 5)^2 - k.\\]The sum of these expressions is\n\\[\\pm 20ax \\mp 20ah = \\pm 20a (x - h),\\]which is the equation of a non-horizontal line.  The answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(D)}}.$",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the given transformations affect the graph of the parabola.\n\nThe original parabola has equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$. When it is reflected about the x-axis, the equation becomes $y=-ax^2-bx-c$.\n\nNow, we translate the original parabola and its reflection horizontally five units in opposite directions. This means that the original parabola becomes $y=f(x)=a(x-5)^2+b(x-5)+c$ and the reflected parabola becomes $y=g(x)=-a(x+5)^2-b(x+5)-c$.\n\nThe sum of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is given by:\n\n$(f+g)(x) = a(x-5)^2+a(x+5)^2 + b(x-5) - b(x+5) + c - c$\n\nWe can simplify this expression by expanding the squares:\n\n$(f+g)(x) = a(x^2 - 10x + 25 + x^2 + 10x + 25) + b(x - 5 - x - 5)$\n\n$(f+g)(x) = a(2x^2 + 50) - 10b$\n\n$(f+g)(x) = 2ax^2 + 50a - 10b$\n\nThis equation represents a parabola with a leading coefficient of $2a$, which is not zero (since the original parabola had a non-zero leading coefficient). It does not intersect the x-axis at any point, since it is a quadratic function with a positive leading coefficient and no constant term. Therefore, the graph of $y=(f+g)(x)$ is a non-horizontal parabola.\n\nThe correct answer is $\\boxed{(D)}$."
