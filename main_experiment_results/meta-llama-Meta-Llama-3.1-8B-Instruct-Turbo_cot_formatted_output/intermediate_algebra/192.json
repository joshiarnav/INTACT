    "problem": "For which value of $x$ does the function $f(x) = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}$ cross its horizontal asymptote?",
    "solution": "The horizontal asymptote of $f$ is the horizontal line that $f$ approaches as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. When the leading terms of the numerator and denominator have the same degree, that line is at the value equal to the ratio of the leading coefficients, namely $y = 2/1 = 2$. Setting this equal to $f(x)$, $$f(x) = 2 = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}.$$Clearing the denominator, $$2(x^2 - 4x + 1) = 2x^2 - 8x + 2 = 2x^2 - 5x - 7 \\Longrightarrow 3x = 9 \\Longrightarrow x = \\boxed{3}.$$",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $x$ for which the function crosses its horizontal asymptote, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the horizontal asymptote**: The horizontal asymptote of a rational function in the form of $\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ is determined by the degree of the polynomials in the numerator and denominator.\n\n   - If the degrees of the numerator and denominator are the same, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n   - If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is $y = 0$.\n   - If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote.\n\n2. **Determine the leading coefficients**: In this problem, the numerator is $2x^2 - 5x - 7$, and the denominator is $x^2 - 4x + 1$.\n\n   - The leading coefficient of the numerator is $2$.\n   - The leading coefficient of the denominator is $1$.\n\n3. **Find the horizontal asymptote**: Since the degrees of the numerator and denominator are the same, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n   - The horizontal asymptote is $y = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$.\n\n4. **Set the function equal to its horizontal asymptote**: To find the value of $x$ for which the function crosses its horizontal asymptote, we need to set the function equal to its horizontal asymptote and solve for $x$.\n\n   - $\\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1} = 2$\n\n5. **Multiply both sides by the denominator**: To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by the denominator.\n\n   - $(2x^2 - 5x - 7) = 2(x^2 - 4x + 1)$\n\n6. **Expand the right side**: Distribute the $2$ on the right side.\n\n   - $(2x^2 - 5x - 7) = 2x^2 - 8x + 2$\n\n7. **Subtract the left side from both sides**: Subtract the left side from both sides to get a new equation.\n\n   - $0 = -8x + 9$\n\n8. **Subtract 9 from both sides**: Subtract $9$ from both sides.\n\n   - $-9 = -8x$\n\n9. **Divide both sides by -8**: Divide both sides by $-8$.\n\n   - $x = \\frac{-9}{-8} = \\frac{9}{8}$\n\nSo, the value of $x$ for which the function crosses its horizontal asymptote is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{8}}$."
