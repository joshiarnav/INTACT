    "problem": "One of the roots of\n\\[ax^3 + 3x^2 + bx - 65 = 0,\\]is $-2 - 3i,$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.  Find the real root of this cubic polynomial.",
    "solution": "Since $-2 - 3i$ is a root\n\\[a (-2 - 3i)^3 + 3 (-2 - 3i)^2 + b (-2 - 3i) - 65 = 0.\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[(-80 + 46a - 2b) + (36 - 9a - 3b)i = 0.\\]Then $-80 + 46a - 2b = 0$ and $36 - 9a - 3b = 0.$  Solving, we find $a = 2$ and $b = 6.$\n\nThe cubic polynomial is then $2x^3 + 3x^2 + 6x - 65 = 0,$ which factors as $(2x - 5)(x^2 + 4x + 13) = 0.$  Therefore, the real root is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the real root of the given cubic polynomial, we need to use the fact that it has a complex conjugate root.\n\nGiven root: $-2 - 3i$\n\nSince the coefficients of the polynomial are real numbers, complex roots must appear in conjugate pairs. Therefore, the other complex root is the conjugate of $-2 - 3i$, which is:\n\n$-2 + 3i$\n\nUsing Vieta's formulas for a cubic polynomial, we know that the sum of all three roots is:\n\n$- \\frac{b_2}{b_3}$\n\nwhere $b_2$ is the coefficient of the $x^2$ term and $b_3$ is the coefficient of the $x^3$ term.\n\nIn this case, $b_2 = 3$ and $b_3 = a$. Therefore, the sum of all three roots is:\n\n$- \\frac{3}{a}$\n\nWe also know that the sum of the complex conjugate roots is:\n\n$(-2 - 3i) + (-2 + 3i) = -4$\n\nSince the sum of all three roots is $- \\frac{3}{a}$, and the sum of the complex conjugate roots is $-4$, we can set up the following equation:\n\n$-4 + r = - \\frac{3}{a}$\n\nwhere $r$ is the real root we want to find.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$r = \\frac{3}{a} - 4$\n\nTo find the value of $r$, we need to find the value of $a$. \n\nWe can use the fact that the product of the roots of a cubic polynomial is:\n\n$- \\frac{b_0}{b_3}$\n\nwhere $b_0$ is the constant term and $b_3$ is the coefficient of the $x^3$ term.\n\nIn this case, $b_0 = -65$ and $b_3 = a$. Therefore, the product of the roots is:\n\n$- \\frac{-65}{a}$\n\nThe product of the roots is also equal to the product of the given complex root and its conjugate:\n\n$(-2 - 3i) \\times (-2 + 3i) = 13$\n\nSetting the two products equal to each other, we get:\n\n$- \\frac{-65}{a} = 13$\n\nSolving for $a$, we get:\n\n$a = \\frac{-65}{-13} = 5$\n\nNow that we have the value of $a$, we can substitute it into the equation for $r$:\n\n$r = \\frac{3}{5} - 4$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$r = \\frac{3}{5} - \\frac{20}{5}$\n\n$r = \\frac{-17}{5}$"
