    "solution": "We look for integers $a$ and $b$ such that \\[\\sqrt{37-20\\sqrt3} = a-b\\sqrt3.\\]Squaring both sides, we have $37-20\\sqrt3=(a-b\\sqrt3)^2 = (a^2+3b^2) - 2ab\\sqrt3.$ Therefore, we must have \\[\\begin{aligned} a^2+3b^2 &= 37, \\\\ -2ab &= -20. \\end{aligned}\\]The second equation gives $ab=10.$ Trying the factor pairs of $10,$ we find that $(a,b)=(5,2)$ satisfies $a^2+3b^2=37.$ Therefore, $(37-20\\sqrt3)=(5-2\\sqrt3)^2.$ Since $5-2\\sqrt3 \\ge 0,$ it follows that \\[\\sqrt{37-20\\sqrt3} = \\boxed{5-2\\sqrt3}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To simplify the expression, we'll use the identity $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$, and we'll also use the fact that if $x = a - b$ and $y = a + b$, then $x^2 + y^2 = 2a^2 + 2b^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy$.\n\nLet's begin by assuming that the given expression can be written in the form $x - y\\sqrt3$, where $x$ and $y$ are integers. This is because the expression contains both a rational part and an irrational part.\n\nTherefore, we have \\[\\sqrt{37-20\\sqrt3} = x-y\\sqrt3.\\]\n\nSquaring both sides, we get \\begin{align*}\n37-20\\sqrt3 &= (x-y\\sqrt3)^2\\\\\n&= x^2 - 2xy\\sqrt3 + 3y^2\\\\\n&= x^2 - 2xy\\sqrt3 + 3y^2\n\\end{align*}Equating the rational parts and the irrational parts, we get two equations: \\begin{align*}\n37 &= x^2 + 3y^2,\\\\\n-20\\sqrt3 &= -2xy\\sqrt3.\n\\end{align*}Dividing both sides of the second equation by $-2\\sqrt3$, we get \\[xy = 10.\\]Now, let's solve the first equation, which is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$ and $y$. We can rewrite the equation as \\[x^2 + 3y^2 = 37,\\]or equivalently as \\[x^2 = 37 - 3y^2.\\]Substituting $xy = 10$, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$ as \\[y = \\frac{10}{x}.\\]Substituting this expression into the equation above, we get \\begin{align*}\nx^2 &= 37 - 3y^2\\\\\n&= 37 - 3\\left(\\frac{10}{x}\\right)^2\\\\\n&= 37 - \\frac{300}{x^2}\\\\\nx^4 - 37x^2 + 300 &= 0.\n\\end{align*}This equation can be solved by factoring. We can rewrite the left-hand side as \\begin{align*}\nx^4 - 37x^2 + 300 &= (x^2-25)(x^2-12)\\\\\n&= (x^2-25)(x-\\sqrt{12})(x+\\sqrt{12})\n\\end{align*}Since $x^2-25$ is a factor of the equation, we know that either $x^2-25 = 0$ or $x-\\sqrt{12}$ and $x+\\sqrt{12}$ are factors of the equation. \n\nNow, we can solve the equation $x^2-25 = 0$ as follows: \\begin{align*}\nx^2-25 &= 0\\\\\nx^2 &= 25\\\\\nx &= \\pm 5\n\\end{align*}Substituting $x = \\pm 5$ into the equation $xy = 10$, we get \\begin{align*}\n(\\pm 5)y &= 10\\\\\ny &= \\mp 2\n\\end{align*}If $x = \\pm 5$ and $y = \\mp 2$, then $x^2 + 3y^2 = 25 + 12 = 37$, so the values of $x$ and $y$ satisfy the equation.\n\nSince we assumed that $x - y\\sqrt3$ was equal to the given expression, we know that \\[\\sqrt{37-20\\sqrt3} = x - y\\sqrt3 = \\boxed{\\pm 5 - \\mp2\\sqrt3}.\\]\n\nHowever, squaring both sides of the expression $\\pm 5 - \\mp2\\sqrt3$ results in $37-20\\sqrt3$, and the square root of this expression can only be $\\pm 5 - \\mp2\\sqrt3$.\n\nTherefore, \\[\\sqrt{37-20\\sqrt3} = \\boxed{5-2\\sqrt3}.\\]"
