    "solution": "Because the foci both lie on the line $x=5$ and the center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the segment connecting the foci, the center must also lie on the line $x=5.$ However, we also know that the asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at the center. Therefore, the center of the hyperbola lies on both the line $x=5$ and the line $y=3x,$ so its coordinates are $(5, 15).$\n\nBecause the hyperbola has a horizontal axis, the other asymptote must have slope $-3.$ Therefore, we can write a point-slope equation for the other asymptote: \\[y - 15 = -3(x - 5),\\]which is equivalent to $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the equation of the other asymptote of the hyperbola, we need to find the center and the slope of the other asymptote.\n\nGiven that the foci of the hyperbola have the same $x-$coordinate, which is $5,$ and that the asymptotes of a hyperbola intersect at its center. \n\nLet the center of the hyperbola be $(a, b).$\n\nSince the asymptotes intersect at the center, and one of the asymptotes is $y = 3x,$ the other asymptote must also pass through the point $(a, b).$\n\nThe slope of the asymptotes of a hyperbola is given by $\\pm \\frac{b}{a}$, where $a^2$ is the square of the distance from the center to a vertex and $b^2$ is the square of the distance from the center to a co-vertex.\n\nSince the slope of one of the asymptotes is $3$ (i.e., $m_1 = 3$), the slope of the other asymptote must be $-3$ (i.e., $m_2 = -3$).\n\nNow, let's find the center $(a, b)$. We know that the foci of the hyperbola have the same $x-$coordinate, which is $5.$\n\nSince the foci of the hyperbola have the same $x-$coordinate, the transverse axis of the hyperbola is horizontal.\n\nThe center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the line segment connecting the two foci.\n\nLet the distance between the foci be $2c$. Then the coordinates of the foci are $(5-c, b)$ and $(5+c, b).$\n\nThe center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the line segment connecting the two foci, so its coordinates are\n\n\\begin{align*}\na &= \\frac{5+c+5-c}{2} = 5,\\\\\nb &= \\frac{b+b}{2} = b.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the center are $(5, b).$\n\nSince the asymptotes intersect at the center, and one of the asymptotes is $y = 3x,$ we can substitute the expression for the center into the equation of the other asymptote:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= -3x + b\\\\\nb &= -3(5) + b\\\\\n-15 &= b\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo, the equation of the other asymptote is\n\n$$y = -3x - 15.$$"
