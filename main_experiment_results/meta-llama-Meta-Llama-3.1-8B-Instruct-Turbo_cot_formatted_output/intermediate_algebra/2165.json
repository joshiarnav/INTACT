    "model_solution": "To find the remainder when a polynomial is divided by another polynomial, we can use the Remainder Theorem. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of the division of a polynomial f(x) by a divisor of the form (x - c) is just f(c). \n\nHowever, our divisor isn't of the form (x - c). Instead, it's (2x - 6). To use the Remainder Theorem with this divisor, we can rewrite it as (x - 3), by dividing both sides of the equation 2x - 6 = 0 by 2. \n\nThis gives us x - 3 = 0, where c = 3. Now we can apply the Remainder Theorem by substituting c = 3 into the original polynomial:\n\nf(3) = 6(3)^4 - 14(3)^3 - 4(3)^2 + 2(3) - 26\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of f(3):\n\nf(3) = 6(81) - 14(27) - 4(9) + 6 - 26\nf(3) = 486 - 378 - 36 + 6 - 26\nf(3) = 52\n\nSo, the remainder when $6x^4-14x^3-4x^2+2x-26$ is divided by $2x - 6$ is $\\boxed{52}$."
