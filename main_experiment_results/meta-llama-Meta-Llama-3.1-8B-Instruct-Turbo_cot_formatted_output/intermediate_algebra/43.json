    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Express $z$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.\n\nStep 2: The complex conjugate of $z$ is given by $\\overline{z} = a - bi$. \n\nStep 3: Substitute $z = a + bi$ into the function $f(z) = i\\overline{z}$. We get $f(z) = i(a - bi) = ia + b$. \n\nStep 4: Since $f(z) = z$, we have $ia + b = a + bi$. \n\nStep 5: Equating the real and imaginary parts of both sides of the equation $ia + b = a + bi$, we get $a = -b$ and $a = b$.\n\nStep 6: The two equations $a = -b$ and $a = b$ seem to be contradictory. However, this is where the condition $|z| = 5$ comes into play.\n\nStep 7: The condition $|z| = 5$ means that $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 5$, or equivalently, $a^2 + b^2 = 25$.\n\nStep 8: Substitute $a = b$ into the equation $a^2 + b^2 = 25$. We get $2a^2 = 25$.\n\nStep 9: Solve for $a$ in the equation $2a^2 = 25$. We get $a^2 = 25/2$, or $a = \\sqrt{25/2} = \\sqrt{25} / \\sqrt{2} = 5/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nStep 10: Since $z = a + bi$, we can substitute $a = 5/\\sqrt{2}$ into $z = a + bi$. We get $z = 5/\\sqrt{2} + (5/\\sqrt{2})i$.\n\nStep 11: However, we also need to consider the other possible solution $a = -b$. \n\nStep 12: Substitute $a = -b$ into the equation $a^2 + b^2 = 25$. We get $2b^2 = 25$.\n\nStep 13: Solve for $b$ in the equation $2b^2 = 25$. We get $b^2 = 25/2$, or $b = \\sqrt{25/2} = \\sqrt{25} / \\sqrt{2} = 5/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nStep 14: Since $a = -b$, we can substitute $b = 5/\\sqrt{2}$ into $a = -b$. We get $a = -5/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nStep 15: Since $z = a + bi$, we can substitute $a = -5/\\sqrt{2}$ into $z = a + bi$. We get $z = -5/\\sqrt{2} + (5/\\sqrt{2})i$.\n\nStep 16: Since we have two solutions for $z$, namely $z_1 = 5/\\sqrt{2} + (5/\\sqrt{2})i$ and $z_2 = -5/\\sqrt{2} + (5/\\sqrt{2})i$, we can conclude that there are $\\boxed{2}$ values of $z$ that satisfy both $|z| = 5$ and $f(z) = z$."
