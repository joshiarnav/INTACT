The Remainder Theorem states that if a polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by $x - c$, then the remainder is $f(c)$.\n\nGiven that $f(x)$ is divided by $x - 1$ and the remainder is $-5$, we can use the Remainder Theorem to write:\n\n$$f(1) = -5$$\n\nSubstitute $x = 1$ into the equation $f(x) = ax^3 - 6x^2 + bx - 5$:\n\n$$a(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + b(1) - 5 = -5$$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$$a - 6 + b - 5 = -5$$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$$a + b - 11 = -5$$\n\nAdd 11 to both sides:\n\n$$a + b = 6$$\n\nNow, given that $f(x)$ is divided by $x + 2$ and the remainder is $-53$, we can use the Remainder Theorem to write:\n\n$$f(-2) = -53$$\n\nSubstitute $x = -2$ into the equation $f(x) = ax^3 - 6x^2 + bx - 5$:\n\n$$a(-2)^3 - 6(-2)^2 + b(-2) - 5 = -53$$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$$-8a - 24 - 2b - 5 = -53$$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$$-8a - 2b = -24$$\n\nDivide both sides by $-2$:\n\n$$4a + b = 12$$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n$$a + b = 6$$\n\n$$4a + b = 12$$\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n$$(4a + b) - (a + b) = 12 - 6$$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$$3a = 6$$\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n$$a = 2$$\n\nNow that we have found $a$, substitute $a = 2$ into one of the equations to find $b$. We will use the equation $a + b = 6$:\n\n$$2 + b = 6$$\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n$$b = 4$$\n\nSo, the ordered pair $(a, b)$ is:\n\n$$\\boxed{(2, 4)}$$"
