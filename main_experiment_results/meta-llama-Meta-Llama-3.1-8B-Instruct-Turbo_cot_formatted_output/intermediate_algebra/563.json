    "problem": "For how many real values of $c$ do we have $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$?",
    "solution": "We have $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\sqrt{{\\frac12}^2 + (-c)^2} = \\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14}$, so $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ gives us $\\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14} = \\frac34$.  Squaring both sides gives $c^2 + \\frac14 = \\frac9{16}$, so $c^2=\\frac5{16}$.  Taking the square root of both sides gives $c = \\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ and $c=-\\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ as solutions, so there are $\\boxed{2}$ real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nWe also could have solved this equation by noting that $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ means that the complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is $\\frac34$ units from the origin in the complex plane.  Therefore, it is on the circle centered at the origin with radius $\\frac34$.  The complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is also on the vertical line that intersects the real axis at $\\frac12$, which is inside the aforementioned circle.  Since this line goes inside the circle, it must intersect the circle at $\\boxed{2}$ points, which correspond to the values of $c$ that satisfy the original equation.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the values of $c$ that satisfy the equation $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$. \n\nStep 1: Recall that the absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number $z$ is given by $|z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$, where $z = a + bi$. \n\nStep 2: In our problem, we have $z = \\frac12 - ci$. So, the absolute value of $z$ is given by $|z| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + (-c)^2}$.\n\nStep 3: We know that $|z| = \\frac34$. So, we set up the equation: $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + (-c)^2} = \\frac34$.\n\nStep 4: Square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root. We get: $\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + (-c)^2 = \\frac{9}{16}$.\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation: $\\frac14 + c^2 = \\frac{9}{16}$.\n\nStep 6: Subtract $\\frac14$ from both sides of the equation to isolate $c^2$. We get: $c^2 = \\frac{9}{16} - \\frac14 = \\frac{9 - 4}{16} = \\frac{5}{16}$.\n\nStep 7: Take the square root of both sides of the equation to solve for $c$. We get: $c = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{16}} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}$.\n\nStep 8: Since there are two values of $c$ that satisfy the equation, the number of real values of $c$ is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
