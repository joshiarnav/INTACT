    "solution": "An example of a quadratic function with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ is $(x-2)(x-4)$. However, when $x=3$, this function takes the value $-1$. However, multiplying the entire quadratic by $-6$ does not change the location of the zeroes, and does give us the desired value at $x=3$.\n\nThus, $-6(x-2)(x-4)$ has all the desired properties. The expanded form of this expression is $\\boxed{-6x^2+36x-48}$.\n\nNote that this is the only such quadratic. Any quadratic must factor as $a(x-r)(x-s)$, where its zeroes are $r$ and $s$; thus a quadratic with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ must be of the form $a(x-2)(x-4)$, and the coefficient $a=-6$ is forced by the value at $x=3$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the quadratic function that satisfies the given conditions, we can start by writing the factored form of the quadratic function:\n\nf(x) = a(x - 2)(x - 4)\n\nSince the function has zeroes at x = 2 and x = 4, the factored form will have the corresponding factors. We can substitute x = 3 into this equation to solve for a:\n\nf(3) = a(3 - 2)(3 - 4)\n6 = a(1)(-1)\n6 = -a\n\nTo find the value of a, we multiply both sides by -1:\n\na = -6\n\nNow that we have the value of a, we can substitute it back into the factored form of the quadratic function:\n\nf(x) = -6(x - 2)(x - 4)\n\nTo expand this expression, we can distribute the -6 to both factors:\n\nf(x) = -6(x^2 - 4x - 2x + 8)\nf(x) = -6(x^2 - 6x + 8)\n\nTo fully expand the expression, we distribute the -6 to all terms inside the parentheses:\n\nf(x) = -6x^2 + 36x - 48\n\nSo, the quadratic function in expanded form is -6x^2 + 36x - 48."
