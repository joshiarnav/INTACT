    "problem": "You have a rectangular prism box with length $x+5$ units, width $x-5$ units, and height $x^{2}+25$ units. For how many positive integer values of $x$ is the volume of the box less than 700 units?",
    "solution": "To find the volume of the box, we multiply the three dimensions: $(x+5)(x-5)(x^{2}+25) = (x^{2}-25)(x^{2}+25) = x^{4}-625$. We want to find $x$ such that $x^{4}-625<700$, which simplifies to $x^{4}<1325$. Taking the fourth root shows us that $x$ is less than $\\sqrt[4]{1325}$, which is between 6 and 7 (since $6^4=1296$ while $7^4=2401$). So $x$ could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, we see that the width is $x-5$ units, and this must be a positive number, so the only value of $x$ which works is 6. Thus, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ possible value of $x$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of the box, we multiply its length, width, and height. \n\nVolume = (length) \u00d7 (width) \u00d7 (height)\n= (x + 5) \u00d7 (x - 5) \u00d7 (x^2 + 25)\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression for volume. \n\n(x + 5) \u00d7 (x - 5) = x^2 - 25 (difference of squares)\n\nSo, the volume expression becomes:\nVolume = (x^2 - 25) \u00d7 (x^2 + 25)\n\nNow, multiply the expressions:\nVolume = x^4 - 625\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which the volume is less than 700 units. \n\nx^4 - 625 < 700\n\nAdd 625 to both sides:\nx^4 < 1325\n\nNow, take the fourth root of both sides:\nx < \u221c(1325)\n\nCalculate the fourth root of 1325:\nx < 6.88 (approximately)\n\nSince x must be a positive integer and x - 5 > 0 (to ensure width is positive), we have:\n5 < x < 6.88\n\nThis means that x must be either 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{1}$."
