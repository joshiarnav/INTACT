    "model_solution": "To find the largest possible area of triangle $ABC,$ we first need to find the coordinates of point $C.$ We know that $C$ lies on the parabola $y = -x^2 + 6x - 5,$ so we can substitute the coordinates of $C,$ $(p,q),$ into this equation and solve for $p$ and $q.$\n\nWe have that $q = -p^2 + 6p - 5.$ Now, we want to maximize the area of triangle $ABC.$ We can do this by using the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices. However, we first need to determine the third vertex. We'll use the point $D(0, -5).$\n\nThe area of a triangle with vertices $(x_1, y_1),$ $(x_2, y_2),$ and $(x_3, y_3),$ is given by the formula\n\n$A = \\frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|.$\n\nUsing this formula, we can write the area of triangle $ABC$ as\n\n$A = \\frac{1}{2} |1(3 - q) + 4(q - 0) + p(0 - 3)|.$\n\nSubstituting the value of $q,$ we get\n\n$A = \\frac{1}{2} |3 - p^2 + 6p - 5 + 4p - 3p| = \\frac{1}{2} |(9p - p^2) - 5|.$\n\nWe want to maximize $A,$ so we want to maximize $9p^2 - 18p + 5.$ To do this, we can first find the critical points by taking the derivative of this expression with respect to $p$ and setting it equal to $0.$\n\nWe have that $\\frac{d}{dp} (9p^2 - 18p + 5) = 18p - 18.$ Setting this equal to $0$ and solving for $p,$ we get\n\n$18p - 18 = 0 \\Rightarrow 18p = 18 \\Rightarrow p = 1.$\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the endpoints of the interval, which are $p = 1$ and $p = 4.$\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the expression $9p^2 - 18p + 5$ at these three critical points. We have that\n\n$9(1)^2 - 18(1) + 5 = 9 - 18 + 5 = -4,$\n$9(2)^2 - 18(2) + 5 = 36 - 36 + 5 = 5,$ and\n$9(4)^2 - 18(4) + 5 = 144 - 72 + 5 = 77.$\n\nSince the largest value of $9p^2 - 18p + 5$ is $77,$ the largest possible area of triangle $ABC$ is\n\n$\\frac{1}{2} |(9p - p^2) - 5| = \\frac{1}{2} |(9(1) - (1)^2) - 5| = \\boxed{7}.$"
