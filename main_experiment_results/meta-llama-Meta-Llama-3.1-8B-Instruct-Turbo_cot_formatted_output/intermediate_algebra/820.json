    "problem": "Find the roots of $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$. Enter your answer as a list of numbers separated by commas.",
    "solution": "Since the polynomial has no constant term, we can immediately factor out an $x$ from every term\n$$x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20),$$and our first root $x=0$. Let $g(x) = 6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$. Then the remaining roots of our original polynomial are the roots of $g(x)$. By trying out simple values, we can see that $g(0) = 20 > 0$ and $g(1) = 6+19-51+20 = -6<0$. Thus, there must be a root of $g(x)$ between $0$ and $1$. From the Rational Root Theorem, we know that if $g(p/q) = 0$ then $p$ must divide $20$ and $q$ must divide $6$.\n\nChecking rational numbers of the form $p/q$, where $p$ divides $20$ and $q$ divides $6$, and $p/q$ is between $0$ and $1$, we find that\n$$\\begin{aligned} g\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) &= 6\\cdot\\frac{1}{8}+19\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}-51\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}+20 = 0.\n\\end{aligned}$$This means that $2x - 1$ is a factor of $g(x).$ Dividing by $2x-1$ gives us $g(x) = (2x-1)(3x^2+11x-20)$.\n\nThe quadratic $3x^2+11x-20$ factors as $(3x-4)(x+5),$ so our last two roots are $4/3$ and $-5$.\n\nThus, the roots of $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$ are $\\boxed{0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{4}{3}, -5}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the roots of the given polynomial $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$, we can start by factoring out a common factor. \n\nFirst, let's factor out $x$ from all the terms:\n\n$6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x = x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20)$\n\nNow we have a factored form of the polynomial. However, we still need to find the roots of the polynomial inside the parentheses.\n\nTo find the roots of $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$, we can try factoring it further. Unfortunately, this cubic polynomial does not factor easily. \n\nHowever, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots. The factors of the constant term $20$ are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 5, \\pm 10, \\pm 20$ and the factors of the leading coefficient $6$ are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6$. \n\nThe possible rational roots are the combinations of the factors of the constant term and the leading coefficient, i.e., $\\pm \\frac{1}{1}, \\pm \\frac{2}{1}, \\pm \\frac{4}{1}, \\pm \\frac{5}{1}, \\pm \\frac{10}{1}, \\pm \\frac{20}{1}, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{2}{2}, \\pm \\frac{4}{2}, \\pm \\frac{5}{2}, \\pm \\frac{10}{2}, \\pm \\frac{20}{2}, \\pm \\frac{1}{3}, \\pm \\frac{2}{3}, \\pm \\frac{4}{3}, \\pm \\frac{5}{3}, \\pm \\frac{10}{3}, \\pm \\frac{20}{3}, \\pm \\frac{1}{6}, \\pm \\frac{2}{6}, \\pm \\frac{4}{6}, \\pm \\frac{5}{6}, \\pm \\frac{10}{6}, \\pm \\frac{20}{6}$ \n\nSimplifying the list by removing duplicates, we get $\\pm 1, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm 2, \\pm \\frac{1}{3}, \\pm \\frac{2}{3}, \\pm 4, \\pm \\frac{1}{6}, \\pm \\frac{2}{6}, \\pm 5, \\pm \\frac{5}{2}, \\pm 10, \\pm \\frac{5}{3}, \\pm \\frac{10}{3}, \\pm 20, \\pm \\frac{20}{3}, \\pm \\frac{10}{6}, \\pm \\frac{20}{6}$ \n\nNow we can test each of these possible rational roots by plugging them into the polynomial and checking if the result is equal to zero. \n\nAfter testing, we find that $x=-\\frac{1}{2}$ is a root. \n\nUsing polynomial long division or synthetic division, we can divide the polynomial by $x+\\frac{1}{2}$ to get:\n\n$6x^3+19x^2-51x+20 = (2x+1)(3x^2+8x-20)$\n\nNow we need to find the roots of the quadratic polynomial $3x^2+8x-20$.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$\n\nwhere $a=3$, $b=8$, and $c=-20$.\n\nPlugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2-4(3)(-20)}}{2(3)}$\n$x = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64+240}}{6}$\n$x = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{304}}{6}$\n$x = \\frac{-8 \\pm 4\\sqrt{19}}{6}$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{19}}{3}$\n\nSo the roots of the quadratic polynomial are:\n\n$x = \\frac{-4 + 2\\sqrt{19}}{3}$ and $x = \\frac{-4 - 2\\sqrt{19}}{3}$\n\nGoing back to the original polynomial, we can now write the factored form as:\n\n$6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x = x(x+\\frac{1}{2})(2x+1)(3x^2+8x-20)$\n\nCombining the roots we've found, we get:\n\n$x=0, x=-\\frac{1}{2}, x=-\\frac{1}{2}, x=\\frac{-4+2\\sqrt{19}}{3}, x=\\frac{-4-2\\sqrt{19}}{3}$"
