    "problem": "Find the ordered pair $(a,b)$ of real numbers such that the cubic polynomials $x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6 = 0$ and $x^3 + bx^2 + 14x + 8 = 0$ have two distinct roots in common.",
    "solution": "Let $r$ and $s$ be the two common roots.  Then $r$ and $s$ are the roots of\n\\[(x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) - (x^3 + bx^2 + 14 + 8) = (a - b) x^2 - 3x - 2.\\]Note that $r$ and $s$ are also the roots of\n\\begin{align*}\n&4(x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) - 3(x^3 + bx^2 + 14x + 8) \\\\\n&= x^3 + (4a - 3b) x^2 + 2x \\\\\n&= x[x^2 + (4a - 3b) x + 2].\n\\end{align*}Since the constant coefficient of $x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6$ is nonzero, both $r$ and $s$ are non-zero.  Therefore, $r$ and $s$ are the roots of\n\\[x^2 + (4a - 3b) x + 2.\\]Hence, both $r$ and $s$ are the roots of $-x^2 + (3b - 4a) x - 2.$  But $r$ and $s$ are also the roots of $(a - b) x^2 - 3x - 2,$ so the coefficients must match.  This gives us $a - b = -1$ and $3b - 4a = -3.$  Solving, we find $(a,b) = \\boxed{(6,7)}.$\n\nFor these values, the given cubics become\n\\begin{align*}\nx^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6 &= (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3), \\\\\nx^3 + 7x^2 + 14x + 8 &= (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 4).\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "To find the ordered pair $(a,b)$ of real numbers, we can use the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Let's assume $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, and $\\delta$ are the roots of the given polynomials $x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6 = 0$ and $x^3 + bx^2 + 14x + 8 = 0$ respectively. \n\nStep 2: According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of a polynomial is given by $- \\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}$ where $a_n$ is the leading coefficient and $a_{n-1}$ is the coefficient of the second highest degree term. Using this information, we can write the following equations:\n\n$\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = -a$\n$\\alpha + \\beta + \\delta = -b$\n$\\gamma + \\delta = -11 + a$\n\nStep 3: We are given that the two cubic polynomials have two distinct roots in common, so $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are the roots of both polynomials. This means that $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = \\alpha + \\beta + \\delta$. \n\nStep 4: Using the equation $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = \\alpha + \\beta + \\delta$, we can substitute $\\gamma + \\delta = -11 + a$ to obtain:\n\n$\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = \\alpha + \\beta -(-11 + a)$\n$\\gamma = -11 + a$\n\n\nStep 5: Now, we can substitute the value of $\\gamma$ into the equation $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = -a$ to obtain $\\alpha + \\beta -11 + a = -a$. We can simplify this equation to $2a + \\alpha + \\beta = -11$. \n\nStep 6: In a similar way, we can substitute the value of $\\gamma$ into the equation $\\gamma + \\delta = -11 + a$ to obtain $-11 + a + \\delta = -11 + a$, which simplifies to $\\delta = 0$.\n\nStep 7: Since $\\delta = 0$, we can substitute this expression into the second equation in Step 2: $\\alpha + \\beta + 0 = -b$. We can simplify this to obtain $\\alpha + \\beta = -b$.\n\nStep 8: We can now substitute the expressions for $\\alpha + \\beta$ and $\\gamma$ into the third equation in Step 2: $\\gamma + \\delta = -11 + a$. We get: \n\n$(-11 + a) + 0 = -11 + a$\n\nStep 9: We can now substitute $\\gamma = -11 + a$ into the first equation in Step 2: $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = -a$. We get: \n\n$\\alpha + \\beta + (-11 + a) = -a$\n\nStep 10: We can now substitute $\\gamma = -11 + a$ into the first equation in Step 2: $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = -a$. We get: \n\n$\\alpha + \\beta + (-11 + a) = -a$\n\nStep 11: We can now use the expression for $\\alpha + \\beta$ obtained from the equation $\\alpha + \\beta = -b$ to substitute into the equation $2a + \\alpha + \\beta = -11$. We can simplify the equation to: \n\n$2a - b = -11$\n\nStep 12: Now we can use the expression for $\\alpha + \\beta$ obtained from the equation $\\alpha + \\beta = -b$ to substitute into the equation $2a + \\alpha + \\beta = -11$. We can simplify the equation to: \n\n$2a - b = -11$\n\nStep 13: We can also substitute $\\delta = 0$ into the second equation in Step 2: $\\alpha + \\beta + \\delta = -b$ to obtain $\\ Alpha + \\beta + 0 = -b$. Simplifying this, we get $\\alpha + \\beta = -b$.\n\nStep 14: Since we know that $\\alpha + \\beta = -b$ and $\\gamma = -11 + a$, we can use the fact that $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = -a$ to write the equation $\\alpha + \\beta + (-11 + a) = -a$.\n\nStep 15: We can simplify the equation $\\alpha + \\beta + (-11 + a) = -a$ to $2a + \\alpha + \\beta = -11$.\n\nStep 16: Since $\\alpha + \\beta = -b$, we can substitute this into the equation $2a + \\alpha + \\beta = -11$ to obtain $2a - b = -11$.\n\nStep 17: We can solve the system of equations:\n\n$\\begin{cases}\n2a - b = -11 \\\\\na - 3 = 0 \\\\\n\\end{cases}$\n\nStep 18: Using substitution or elimination, we can solve the system of equations to find $a = 3$ and $b = 17$.\n\n$\\boxed{(3,17)}$"
