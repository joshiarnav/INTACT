    "problem": "If the seven-digit number $854n526$ is divisible by $11$, what is $n$?",
    "solution": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$.",

    "model_solution": "To determine if a number is divisible by $11$, we can use the divisibility rule for $11$. This rule states that a number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the difference between the sum of its digits in the odd positions and the sum of its digits in the even positions is a multiple of $11$. \n\nLet's apply this rule to the given number $854n526$. We will separate the digits into two groups: one group consists of the digits in the odd positions (first, third, fifth, seventh) and the other group consists of the digits in the even positions (second, fourth, sixth).\n\nGroup 1 (odd positions): $8$, $4$, $n$, $6$\nGroup 2 (even positions): $5$, $5$, $2$\n\nNow, we will calculate the sum of the digits in each group:\n \nSum of Group 1: $8 + 4 + n + 6 = 18 + n$\nSum of Group 2: $5 + 5 + 2 = 12$\n\nNow we need to calculate the difference between the sum of Group 1 and the sum of Group 2:\n \n$(18 + n) - 12 = 6 + n$\n\nAccording to the rule, the number is divisible by $11$ if the difference between the sums of the digits in the odd and even positions is a multiple of $11$. So we need to find a value of $n$ such that $6 + n$ is a multiple of $11$. The possible values are $6 + n = 11k$, where $k$ is an integer. \n\nConsidering that $n$ is a digit and therefore an integer between $0$ and $9$, we will look for an integer $k$ such that $6 + n = 11k$. We can test each possible value of $n$ to find the solution.\n\nFor $n = 0$, $6 + n = 6$ and $6$ is not a multiple of $11$.\n\nFor $n = 1$, $6 + n = 7$ and $7$ is not a multiple of $11$.\n\nFor $n = 2$, $6 + n = 8$ and $8$ is not a multiple of $11$.\n\nFor $n = 3$, $6 + n = 9$ and $9$ is not a multiple of $11$.\n\nFor $n = 4$, $6 + n = 10$ and $10$ is not a multiple of $11$.\n\nFor $n = 5$, $6 + n = 11$ and $11$ is a multiple of $11$.\n\nSince $n=5$ satisfies the condition, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$."
