    "problem": "What is the digit in the tens place when $7^{2005}$ is expressed in decimal notation?",
    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of the last two digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $07, 49, 43, 01, 07, 49, 43, 01,\\ldots$ . The cycle of the last two digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 numbers long: 07, 49, 43, 01. Thus, to find the tens digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=0$ or 1 corresponds to the tens digit 0, and $R=2$ or 3 corresponds to the units digit 4). Since $2005\\div4=501R1$, the tens digit of $7^{2005}$ is $ \\boxed{0}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the digit in the tens place of $7^{2005}$, we need to find a pattern in the last two digits of powers of 7.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the last two digits of the first few powers of 7:\n\n- $7^1$ = 07\n- $7^2$ = 49\n- $7^3$ = 43 (because 7 * 49 = 343), and the last two digits are 43\n- $7^4$ = 01 (because 43 * 7 = 301, and 301 ends with 01)\n- $7^5$ = 07 (because 01 * 7 = 07)\n\nWe can see that the sequence of the last two digits repeats every 4 powers: 07, 49, 43, 01, 07, 49, 43, 01, ...\n\nNow, let's find the remainder when 2005 is divided by 4. \n\n2005 / 4 = 501 remainder 1\n\nSince the remainder is 1, the last two digits of $7^{2005}$ are the same as the last two digits of $7^1$, which are 07.\n\nTherefore, the digit in the tens place of $7^{2005}$ is $\\boxed{0}$."
