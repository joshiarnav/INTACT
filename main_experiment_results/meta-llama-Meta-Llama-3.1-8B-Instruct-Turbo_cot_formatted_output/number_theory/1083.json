    "problem": "A positive number is called $n$-primable if it is divisible by $n$ and each of its digits is a one-digit prime number. How many 3-primable positive integers are there that are less than 1000?",
    "solution": "The one-digit prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7. A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. So we want to count the number of ways we can pick three or fewer of these digits that add up to a multiple of 3 and form a number with them. We will use modular arithmetic. Of our allowable digits, $3 \\equiv 0$, $7 \\equiv 1$, $2\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, and $5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. The ways to add up 3 or fewer numbers to get 0 modulo 3 are shown:\n\n1. 0\n\n2. 0 + 0\n\n3. 1 + 2\n\n4. 0 + 0 + 0\n\n5. 1 + 1 + 1\n\n6. 2 + 2 + 2\n\n7. 0 + 1 + 2\n\nWe will count the number of 3-primable integers each case produces:\n\n1. There is 1 number, 3.\n\n2. There is 1 number, 33.\n\n3. One of the digits is 7, and the other digit is either 2 or 5. So there are 2 choices for this digit, and once the digit is chosen, there are 2 ways to arrange the digits of the 3-primable number (for example, if we choose the digit 2, then we could either have 72 or 27). So there are $(2)(2) = 4$ numbers in this case.\n\n4. There is 1 number, 333.\n\n5. There is 1 number, 777.\n\n6. Each of the three digits is either 2 or 5. This gives $2^3 = 8$ numbers.\n\n7. One of the digits is 3, one of the digits is 7, and the other digit is either 2 or 5. Once we choose either 2 or 5, there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the digits of the 3-primable number. So there are $2(6) = 12$ numbers in this case.\n\nSo in total, our answer is $1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 8 + 12 = \\boxed{28}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of 3-primable positive integers less than 1000, we need to consider numbers that are divisible by 3 and have digits consisting of one-digit prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\nSince a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, we need to consider the possible sums of the digits.\n\nThe sums of the digits can be 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18, because these are the only possible sums we can get using one-digit prime numbers that are divisible by 3.\n\nHowever, we can only use the digits 2, 3, 5, 7 to form the numbers. \n\n- For a sum of 3, the only possibility is 3.\n- For a sum of 6, the possibilities are 2+2+2 or 3+3.\n- For a sum of 9, the possibilities are 2+2+2+3, 2+3+3+1 (1 is not a one-digit prime so it is not included), 3+3+3, or 2+5+2 (not included because the digits are not distinct), 3+3+3, 2+2+5, 3+3+3, 3+5+1 (1 is not a one-digit prime so it is not included), 5+3+1 is not included, or 2+7+0 (0 is not a one-digit prime so it is not included). So the possibilities are 222, 33, 222, 333, 225, 222, 333, 235, 222, 333, 222, 335. However only the digits 222, 33, 225, 235, 333 are made of only prime digits.\n- For a sum of 12, the possibilities are 2+2+2+2+2+2 or 2+2+2+3+5 or 3+3+2+4 (4 is not a one digit prime so it is not included), 3+3+3+3 or 2+5+3+2, 3+3+3+3, 222222, 23522, 22533, 32255, 22533, 32522, 33522, 33333, 222235.
