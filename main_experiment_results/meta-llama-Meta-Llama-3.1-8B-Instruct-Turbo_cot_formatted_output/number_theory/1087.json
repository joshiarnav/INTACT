    "problem": "What is the $100$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{3}{26}$ is expressed as a decimal?",
    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block. We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$. Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To express $\\frac{3}{26}$ as a decimal, we can use long division. \n\nFirst, divide 3 by 26 using long division: \n\n   0.1\n26 |\n3.00\n-2.6\n-0.00\n------\n0.40\n\nThe result is that $\\frac{3}{26}$ expressed as a decimal is 0.1 recurring, or $0.\\overline{1}$. \n\nSince the decimal is recurring with a single digit (1), the pattern will repeat indefinitely. So, to find the $100$th digit after the decimal point, we can determine the position of the digit within the recurring pattern.\n\nSince the pattern is of a single digit, every digit is the $100$th digit. Thus, the $100$th digit after the decimal point is $\\boxed{1}$."
