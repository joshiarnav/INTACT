    "solution": "To find the least common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, we ignore 1 and prime factorize the rest to obtain $2, 3, 2^2, 5, 2\\cdot 3, 7, 2^3$, and $3^2$. Taking the maximum exponent for each prime, we find that the least common multiple is $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{2520}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest number divisible by integers 1 through 9, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. \n\nThe numbers 1 through 9 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\nBreaking each number down to its prime factors, we have:\n\n- 2\n- 3\n- 3\n- 2 * 2\n- 5\n- 2 * 3\n- 7\n- 2 * 2 * 2\n- 3 * 3\n\nNow, to find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:\n\n- 2 appears as 2, 2*2, 2*2*2, so we take 2*2*2 = 8\n- 3 appears as 3, 3, 3*3, so we take 3*3 = 9\n- 5 appears as 5, so we take 5\n- 7 appears as 7, so we take 7\n\nNow, we multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM:\n\nLCM = 8 * 9 * 5 * 7\n     = 2520\n\nSo, the smallest number divisible by integers 1 through 9 is $\\boxed{2520}$."
