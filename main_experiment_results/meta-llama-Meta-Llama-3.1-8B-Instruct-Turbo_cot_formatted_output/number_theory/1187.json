    "model_solution": "To find the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7, we first need to determine the range of numbers we are considering.\n\nThe smallest two-digit multiple of 7 is 14, and the largest two-digit multiple of 7 is 98.\n\nNow, we can list all the multiples of 7 in this range: 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98.\n\nThere are 14 numbers in this list.\n\nTo find the mean, we need to add up all the numbers and divide by the count of numbers.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: \nsum = (n/2)(a + l), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.\n\nIn this case, n = 14, a = 14, and l = 98.\n\nsum = (14/2)(14 + 98) \nsum = (7)(112) \nsum = 784\n\nNow, we divide the sum by the count of numbers to find the mean:\nmean = sum / n\nmean = 784 / 14\nmean = 56\n\nTherefore, the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7 is $\\boxed{56}$."
