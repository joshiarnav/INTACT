    "problem": "What is the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25?",
    "solution": "Every multiple of 25 ends in 00, 25, 50, or 75.  Since we want the product of the digits to be a positive multiple of 25, the final two digits must be either 25 or 75.\n\nA nonzero product of digits is a multiple of 25 exactly when two or more of the digits is are equal to 5. If a number ends in 75 and the product of its digits is a multiple of 25, then replacing 75 by 25 in that number will also give a smaller number whose product of digits is a multiple of 25.  Therefore we are looking for a number whose final two digits are 25 and for which 5 is one of the other digits.\n\nSince 525 is the smallest such number, the answer must be $\\boxed{525}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25, we need to consider the properties of multiples of 25 and the product of their digits.\n\nSince 25 is a multiple of 5^2, any multiple of 25 will have 25 or 00 as the last two digits.\n\nThe product of the digits will also be a multiple of 25 if it contains at least two factors of 5 (to be a multiple of 5^2).\n\nConsidering this, the smallest possible digits that satisfy this condition are 5 and 5 (since 5*5 = 25, which is a multiple of 25).\n\nHowever, for the product of digits to also be a multiple of 25, we need the digits to include 2 fives as a minimum."
