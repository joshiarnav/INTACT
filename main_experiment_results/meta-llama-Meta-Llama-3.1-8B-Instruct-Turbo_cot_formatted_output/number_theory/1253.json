    "problem": "What is the largest number, with its digits all different, whose digits add up to 16?",
    "solution": "For a number to be as large as possible, we want as many places (digits) as possible. To allow for as many digits as possible, we want the digits to be small so that there will be more digits that add up to $16$. We start with the smallest number, $0$ and keep adding the next number. $0+1+2+3+4=10$. However, we cannot add $5$, because then we are left with $16-10-5=1$, and we already have the number $1$. Therefore, the next number to be added would be $16-10=6$.\nNow, we have the numbers $0,1,2,3,4,6$ to form a number. We want the larger places to have larger numbers. Therefore, we order the numbers in decreasing order to form the number $\\boxed{643210}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest number with digits that add up to 16 and are all different, we can start by listing the possible combinations of single-digit numbers that add up to 16. \n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n- 0, 8, 7, 1 (8+7+1 = 16)\n- 0, 9, 6, 1 (9+6+1 = 16)\n- 0, 8, 5, 3 (8+5+3 = 16)\n- 0, 7, 7, 2 (7+7+2 = 16) \n  - However, the digits must all be different, so we exclude this combination.\n\n- 0, 9, 5, 2 (9+5+2 = 16)\n- 0, 7, 4, 5 (7+4+5 = 16)\n- 0, 8, 4, 4 (8+4+4 = 16)\n  - However, the digits must all be different, so we exclude this combination.\n\n- 0, 6, 6, 4 (6+6+4 = 16)\n  - However, the digits must all be different, so we exclude this combination.\n\n- 0, 5, 5, 6 (5+5+6 = 16)\n  - However, the digits must all be different, so we exclude this combination.\n\n- 1, 1, 7, 7 (1+1+7+7 = 16)\n  - However, the digits must all be different, so we exclude this combination.\n\n- 1, 6, 6, 3 (1+6+6+3 = 16)\n  - However, the digits must all be different, so we exclude this combination.\n\n- 1, 5, 5, 5 (1+5+5+5 = 16)\n  - However, the digits must all be different, so we exclude this combination.\n\nNow we have these combinations: (0, 8, 7, 1), (0, 9, 6, 1), (0, 8, 5, 3), (0, 9, 5, 2), and (0, 7, 4, 5). \n\nTo get the largest number, we choose the combination with the largest digits. Among the combinations, (0, 9, 6, 1) is the combination with the largest digits.\n\nSo the largest number with its digits all different and adding up to 16 is:\n$\\boxed{96180}$"
