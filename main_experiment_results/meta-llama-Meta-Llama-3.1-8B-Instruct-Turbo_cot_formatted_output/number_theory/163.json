    "problem": "What is the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 which has two even and two odd digits?",
    "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Smallest odd, four-digit number**: The smallest four-digit number is 10,000. However, we're looking for an odd number which is the smallest four-digit number that ends in an odd digit. So, the smallest four-digit number with an odd digit at the end is 1001.\n\n2. **Divisibility rule for 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. The smallest divisible number starts with 1, so we could try the smallest possible number, 1001. However, 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2, which is not a multiple of 9.\n\n3. **Finding the smallest multiple of 9**: To get to the nearest multiple of 9, we need to find a number that has a digit sum of 9. The smallest multiple of 9 greater than 2 (which is 9 itself), is 9.\n\n4. **Finding the smallest four-digit number with a sum of digits equal to 9**: To get the smallest four-digit number with a sum of digits equal to 9, we can look at combinations of two even and two odd digits that add up to 9.\n\n   The two even digits (0 and 2) would add up to 2, and two odd digits (1 and 7) would also add up to 8, which is 8 less than 9. We could add 1 to the 8, to get the sum of 9. However, having a 7 at the end would make our number, the smallest four-digit number larger than 1001.\n\n   Hence our final answer is 1089, which is our number with a sum of the digits equal to 9."
