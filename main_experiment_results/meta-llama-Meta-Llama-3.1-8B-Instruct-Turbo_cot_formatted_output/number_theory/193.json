    "solution": "We start by testing palindromic sequences in base 4. Since the positive integer must be greater than 5, we start by analyzing $22_4$, which is $1010_2$. We then test $33_4$, which is $1111_2$. Converting to base 10, we have $33_4 = 3(4) + 3 = \\boxed{15}$.",

(Not greater than 5)\n     - 2 in base 4 is 2 in base 10 and 10 in base 2. (Not greater than 5)\n     - 3 in base 4 is 3 in base 10 and 11 in base 2. (Not greater than 5)\n   - Since none of these single-digit numbers in base 4 are greater than 5, we move to two-digit numbers.\n\n2. **Two-digit numbers in base 4**: \n   - We start with the smallest two-digit number in base 4, which is 11 in base 4.\n   - Converting this to base 10: (1 * 4^1) + (1 * 4^0) = 4 + 1 = 5. (Not greater than 5)\n   - Next, we try the smallest two-digit number greater than 11 in base 4, which is 22 in base 4.\n   - Converting this to base 10: (2 * 4^1) + (2 * 4^0) = 8 + 2 = 10 in base 10.\n   - Converting this to base 2: 10 in base 10 is 1010 in base 2 (not a palindrome)\n   - Next, we try the smallest two-digit number greater than 22 in base 4, which is 33 in base 4.\n   - Converting this to base 10: (3 * 4^1) + (3 * 4^0) = 12 + 3 = 15 in base 10.\n   - Converting this to base 2: 15 in base 10 is 1111 in base 2 (palindrome).\n\nSince 1111 in base 2 is the smallest number greater than 5 that is a palindrome, we'll check the next smallest two-digit number in base 4.\n\n3. **Next two-digit number in base 4**: \n   - We try the smallest two-digit number greater than 33 in base 4, which is 44 in base 4.\n   - Converting this to base 10: (4 * 4^1) + (4 * 4^0) = 16 + 4 = 20 in base 10.\n   - Converting this to base 2: 20 in base 10 is 10100 in base 2 (not a palindrome)\n   - Next, we try the smallest two-digit number greater than 44 in base 4, which is 55 in base 4.\n   - Converting this to base 10: (5 * 4^1) + (5 * 4^0) = 20 + 5 = 25 in base 10.\n   - Converting this to base 2: 25 in base 10 is 11001 in base 2 (not a palindrome)\n   - Next, we try the smallest two-digit number greater than 55 in base 4, which is 66 in base 4.\n   - Converting this to base 10: (6 * 4^1) + (6 * 4^0) = 24 + 6 = 30 in base 10.\n   - Converting this to base 2: 30 in base 10 is 11110 in base 2 (not a palindrome)\n   - Next, we try the smallest two-digit number greater than 66 in base 4, which is 77 in base 4.\n   - Converting this to base 10: (7 * 4^1) + (7 * 4^0) = 28 + 7 = 35 in base 10.\n   - Converting this to base 2: 35 in base 10 is 100011 in base 2 (not a palindrome)\n   - Next, we try the smallest two-digit number greater than 77 in base 4, which is 88 in base 4.\n   - Converting this to base 10: (8 * 4^1) + (8 * 4^0) = 32 + 8 = 40 in base 10.\n   - Converting this to base 2: 40 in base 10 is 101000 in base 2 (not a palindrome)\n   - Next, we try the smallest two-digit number greater than 88 in base 4, which is 99 in base 4.\n   - Converting this to base 10: (9 * 4^1) + (9 * 4^0) = 36 + 9 = 45 in base 10.\n   - Converting this to base 2: 45 in base 10 is 101101 in base 2 (not a palindrome)\n\nSince none of these two-digit numbers in base 4 are palindromes in base 2, we move to three-digit numbers in base 4.\n\n4. **Three-digit numbers in base 4**: \n   - We start with the smallest three-digit number in base 4, which is 101 in base 4.\n   - Converting this to base 10: (1 * 4^2) + (0 * 4^1) + (1 * 4^0) = 16 + 0 + 1 = 17 in base 10.\n   - Converting this to base 2: 17 in base 10 is 10001 in base 2 (not a palindrome)\n   - Next, we try the smallest three-digit number greater than 101 in base 4, which is 111 in base 4.\n   - Converting this to base 10: (1 * 4^2) + (1 * 4^1) + (1 * 4^0) = 16 + 4 + 1 = 21 in base 10.\n   - Converting this to base 2: 21 in base 10 is 10101 in base 2 (not a palindrome)\n   - Next, we try the smallest three-digit number greater than 111 in base 4, which is 121 in base 4.\n   - Converting this to base 10: (1 * 4^2) + (2 * 4^1) + (1 * 4^0) = 16 + 8 + 1 = 25 in base 10.\n   - Converting this to base 2: 25 in base 10 is 11001 in base 2 (not a palindrome)\n   - Next, we try the smallest three-digit number greater than 121 in base 4, which is 131 in base 4.\n   - Converting this to base 10: (1 * 4^2) + (3 * 4^1) + (1 * 4^0) = 16 + 12 + 1 = 29 in base 10.\n   - Converting this to base 2: 29 in base 10 is 11101 in base 2 (not a palindrome)\n   - Next, we try the smallest three-digit number greater than 131 in base 4, which is 141 in base 4.\n   - Converting this to base 10: (1 * 4^2) + (4 * 4^1) + (1 * 4^0) = 16 + 16 + 1 = 33 in base 10.\n   - Converting this to base 2: 33 in base 10 is 100001 in base 2 (not a palindrome)\n   - Next, we try the smallest three-digit number greater than 141 in base 4, which is 151 in base 4.\n   - Converting this to base 10: (1 * 4^2) + (5 * 4^1) + (1 * 4^0) = 16 + 20 + 1 = 37 in base 10.\n   - Converting this to base 2: 37 in base 10 is 100101 in base 2 (not a palindrome)\n   - Next, we try the smallest three-digit number greater than 151 in base 4, which is 161 in base 4.\n   - Converting this to base 10: (1 * 4^2) + (6 * 4^1) + (1 * 4^0) = 16 + 24 + 1 = 41 in base 10.\n   - Converting this to base 2: 41 in base 10 is 101001 in base 2 (not a palindrome)\n   - Next, we try the smallest three-digit number greater than 161 in base 4, which is 171 in base 4.\n   - Converting this to base 10: (1 * 4^2) + (7 * 4^1) + (1 * 4^0) = 16 + 28 + 1 = 45 in base 10.\n   - Converting this to base 2: 45 in base 10 is 101101 in base 2 (not a palindrome)\n   - Next, we"
