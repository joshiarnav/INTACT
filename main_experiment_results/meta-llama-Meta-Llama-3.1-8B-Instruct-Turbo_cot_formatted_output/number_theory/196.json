    "solution": "By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768 - 1729) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 39).\n\\end{align*}Since the sum of the digits of $1729$ is $19$, which is not divisible by $3$, it suffices to check whether or not $1729$ is divisible by $13$. We can find that it is by long division or noting that $12+1 = \\boxed{13}$ divides into $1729 = 12^3 + 1^3$ using the sum of cubes factorization.",

    "model_solution": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1729 and 1768, we can use the Euclidean Algorithm. \n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Start with the two numbers: 1729 and 1768.\n\n2. We divide the larger number (1768) by the smaller number (1729), and then take the remainder. We will use this remainder as the new smaller number in the next step.\n\n1768 \u00f7 1729 = 1 with a remainder of 39.\n\n3. Now, we take the previous divisor (1729) and divide it by the remainder (39) from the previous step.\n\n1729 \u00f7 39 = 44 with a remainder of 13.\n\n4. Again, we take the previous divisor (39) and divide it by the remainder (13) from the previous step.\n\n39 \u00f7 13 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\n5. Since we have reached a remainder of 0, the divisor in this step (13) is the greatest common divisor of 1729 and 1768.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of 1729 and 1768 is $\\boxed{13}$."
