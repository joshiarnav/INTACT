    "problem": "What is the units digit of $13^{2003}$?",
    "solution": "Powers of 13 have the same units digit as the corresponding powers of 3; and $$\n3^1 = 3, \\quad 3^2 = 9, \\quad 3^3 = 27, \\quad 3^4 = 81, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 3^5 = 243.\n$$Since the units digit of $3^1$ is the same as the units digit of $3^5$, units digits of powers of 3 cycle through $3, 9, 7,$ and $1$. Hence the units digit of $3^{2000}$ is $1$, so the units digit of $3^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$. The same is true of the units digit of $13^{2003}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the units digit of $13^{2003}$, we can look for a pattern in the units digits of powers of 13. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the units digits of a few small powers of 13:\n\n- $13^1 = 13$, $13^2 = 169$, $13^3 = 2197$, $13^4 = 28561$, $13^5 = 371293$, $13^6 = 4801601$, $13^7 = 62270273$, $13^8 = 812536881$, $13^9 = 10561532813$, $13^{10} = 136763311681$, $13^{11} = 1770772850297$, $13^{12} = 22925483327081$\n\nThe units digits of powers of 13 follow the pattern: $3, 9, 7, 1$. This pattern repeats every 4 powers of 13. Since the units digit of powers of 13 repeat after every 4 powers, we can find the units digit of $13^{2003}$ by finding the remainder when 2003 is divided by 4.\n\n$2003 \\div 4 = 500$ with a remainder of $3$. Therefore, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is the same as the units digit of $13^3$, which is 7. So the answer is $\\boxed{7}$."
