    "model_solution": "To find the remainder when $7145 + 7146 + 7147 + 7148 + 7149$ is divided by 8, we can first calculate the remainder of each number individually when divided by 8.\n\n1. For 7145: \n   $7145 \\mod 8 = 1$ because $1 \\times 8 + 1 = 9$, which is greater than 7145.\n\n2. For 7146: \n   $7146 \\mod 8 = 2$ because $2 \\times 8 + 2 = 18$, which is greater than 7146.\n\n3. For 7147: \n   $7147 \\mod 8 = 3$ because $3 \\times 8 + 3 = 27$, which is greater than 7147.\n\n4. For 7148: \n   $7148 \\mod 8 = 4$ because $4 \\times 8 + 4 = 36$, which is greater than 7148.\n\n5. For 7149: \n   $7149 \\mod 8 = 5$ because $5 \\times 8 + 5 = 45$, which is greater than 7149.\n\nNow, let's find the remainder of the sum when divided by 8:\n$(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) \\mod 8$\n\nSum of the remainders: $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15$\n\n$15 \\mod 8 = 7$ because $1 \\times 8 + 7 = 15$. \n\nSo, the remainder when $7145 + 7146 + 7147 + 7148 + 7149$ is divided by 8 is $\\boxed{7}$."
