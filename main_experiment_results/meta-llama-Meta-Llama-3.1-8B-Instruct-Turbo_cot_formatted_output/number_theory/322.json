    "problem": "Find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.",
    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we need to consider the possible values for the hundreds, tens, and units digits.\n\n1. **Hundreds digit:** Since we want a three-digit number, the hundreds digit must be non-zero and at most 9. \n\n2. **Tens and units digits:** The tens and units digits must also be non-zero and distinct from each other and from the hundreds digit.\n\n3. **Divisibility:** The three-digit number formed by the hundreds, tens, and units digits must be divisible by each of them.\n\nLet's consider some possible cases and start with larger hundreds digits to find the largest possible number.\n\n**Case 1: Hundreds digit = 9**\nIn this case, the number must be divisible by 9, which means the sum of its digits must also be divisible by 9. However, if the sum of the digits is 18 (e.g., 9x, 9y, y), the resulting number will have a hundreds digit of 9, a tens digit of 9, and a units digit of y. This will not work since we want distinct digits.\n\nLet's try some combinations where the hundreds digit is 9 and the sum of the digits is 18.\n\n- 9 + 9 + 0 = 18 (Invalid, as 0 is not a valid digit)\n- 9 + 9 + 0 is invalid because 0 is not a distinct digit. Let's try different values for the tens digit.\n- 9 + 6 + 3 = 18 (valid)\n- 9 + 6 + 3 = 18 (valid)\n- 9 + 3 + 6 = 18 (valid)\n\nThe numbers corresponding to these cases are:\n- 936\n- 963\n- 693\n\nAll of these are divisible by their distinct digits.\n\n**Case 2: Hundreds digit = 8**\nIn this case, the number must be divisible by 8. This is not possible since a number divisible by 8 must have its last three digits divisible by 8.\n\n**Case 3: Hundreds digit = 7**\nIn this case, the number must be divisible by 7. This is not possible since a number divisible by 7 must have its last three digits divisible by 7.\n\n**Case 4: Hundreds digit = 6**\nIn this case, the number must be divisible by 6. This is possible if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n**Case 5: Hundreds digit = 5**\nIn this case, the number must be divisible by 5. This is possible if the number ends in either 0 or 5.\n\n**Case 6: Hundreds digit = 4**\nIn this case, the number must be divisible by 4. This is possible if the number's last two digits are divisible by 4.\n\n**Case 7: Hundreds digit = 3**\nIn this case, the number must be divisible by 3. This is possible if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n\n**Case 8: Hundreds digit = 2**\nIn this case, the number must be divisible by 2. This is possible if the number's last digit is even.\n\n**Case 9: Hundreds digit = 1**\nIn this case, the number must be divisible by 1. This is possible for any number.\n\nTo find the largest number, we should start with the largest hundreds digit and check if the number is divisible by its hundreds digit.\n\nSince we've found that when the hundreds digit is 9, we have the following numbers: \n\n- 936\n- 963\n- 693\n\nThe largest among them is 936.\n\nTherefore, the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits is $\\boxed{936}$."
