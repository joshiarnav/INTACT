    "problem": "A positive five-digit integer is in the form $AB,CBA$; where $A$, $B$ and $C$ are each distinct digits. What is the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven?",
    "solution": "We can test an integer for divisibility by $11$ by alternately adding and subtracting its digits.  For example, $8162$ is divisible by 11 because $8-1+6-2=11$ is divisible by 11.  In this case, $2A-2B+C$ must be divisible by 11.  If there are satisfactory values of $B$ and $C$ corresponding to $A=9$, then the resulting integer would be larger than any integer with $A<9$.  Therefore, we try $A=9$ first.  If $A=9$, then $C-2B+18$ must be divisible by $11$.  Equivalently, $C-2B$ equals $-7$ or $4$, which implies $C=2B-7$ or $C=2B+4$.  Wanting to make $B$ as large as possible, we try $B=9,8,7,\\ldots$. $B$ cannot be $9$ because $A$, $B$, and $C$ must be distinct.  If $B=8$, then $C=9$, so again the digits are not distinct.  If $B=7$, then $C=7$ and still the digits are not distinct.  If $B=6$, then $C=5$, and $AB,\\!CBA=\\boxed{96,\\!569}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven, we need to consider the properties of numbers that are divisible by eleven.\n\nA number is divisible by eleven if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by eleven. \n\nFor the number $AB,CBA$, the alternating sum of its digits is $A - B + C - B + A = 2A - 2B + C$.\n\nSince $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct digits, we want to maximize the value of $A$ and minimize the value of $B$.\n\nLet's assume $A$ is the largest possible digit, which is $9$. Then, we have $2(9) - 2B + C = 18 - 2B + C$.\n\nTo maximize the value of $AB,CBA$, we want to minimize the value of $B$, but still keep the value of $18 - 2B + C$ divisible by eleven.\n\nSince $B$ is a single digit, the minimum value of $B$ is $0$, but it cannot be zero since $A$ and $B$ are distinct digits. The next minimum value of $B$ is $1$.\n\nIf $B = 1$, then we have $18 - 2(1) + C = 16 + C$.\n\nTo make $16 + C$ divisible by eleven, we can try different values of $C$. Since $C$ is a single digit, the possible values of $C$ are $0, 1, 2, \\dots, 9$.\n\nThe largest possible value of $C$ that makes $16 + C$ divisible by eleven is $C = 4$, because $16 + 4 = 20$, which is not divisible by eleven, but $16 + 4 + 11 = 31$ is not divisible by eleven but $20 + 11 = 31$  is not divisible by eleven however 20 - 11 = 9 is not  divisible by eleven."
