This means that $n$ must be a factor of $18$.\n\nThe factors of $18$ are $1, 2, 3, 6, 9,$ and $18$. We need to check each of these factors to ensure that they make $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ an integer.\n\nFor $n=1$:\n$$\\frac{1+18}{1} = 19,$$ which is an integer.\n\nFor $n=2$:\n$$\\frac{2+18}{2} = 10,$$ which is an integer.\n\nFor $n=3$:\n$$\\frac{3+18}{3} = 7,$$ which is an integer.\n\nFor $n=6$:\n$$\\frac{6+18}{6} = 6,$$ which is an integer.\n\nFor $n=9$:\n$$\\frac{9+18}{9} = 5,$$ which is an integer.\n\nFor $n=18$:\n$$\\frac{18+18}{18} = 2,$$ which is an integer.\n\nAll the factors of $18$ make $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ an integer, so the sum of all these factors is:\n\n$$1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 18 = 39$$\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer is:\n\n$$\\boxed{39}$$"
