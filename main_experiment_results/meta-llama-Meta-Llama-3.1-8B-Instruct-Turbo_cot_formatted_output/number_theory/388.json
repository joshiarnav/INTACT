    "problem": "What is the sum of the tens digit and the units digit in the decimal representation of $9^{2004}$?",
    "solution": "Write $9$ as $10-1$ and consider raising 9 to the 2004 power by multiplying out the expression \\[\n\\overbrace{(10-1)(10-1)(10-1)\\cdots(10-1)}^{2004\\text{ factors}}\n\\] There will be $2^{2004}$ terms in this expansion (one for each way to choose either 10 or $-1$ for each of the 2004 factors of $(10-1)$), but most of them will not affect the tens or units digit because they will have two or more factors of 10 and therefore will be divisible by 100.  Only the 2004 terms of $-10$ which come from choosing $-1$ in 2003 of the factors and 10 in the remaining one as well as the term $(-1)^{2004}=1$ remain.  Let $N$ represent the sum of all of the terms with more than 1 factor of 10.  We have \\begin{align*}\n(10-1)^{2004}&=N+2004(-10)+1\\\\\n&= N-20,\\!040+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-40+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-39.\n\\end{align*} So $9^{2004}$ is 39 less than a multiple of 100 and therefore ends in 61.  The sum of 6 and 1 is $\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the tens and units digit of $9^{2004}$, we can first look for a pattern in the powers of 9.\n\nThe pattern starts with the first few powers of 9:\n\n- $9^1 = 9$\n- $9^2 = 81$\n- $9^3 = 729$\n- $9^4 = 6561$\n\nWe can observe that the units digit of the powers of 9 repeat in a cycle of 2: 9, 1. \n\nTo verify this pattern, let's consider $9^2$ and then multiply it by 9 to get the next power:\n\n- $9^2 = 81$\n- $9^3 = 9 \\times 81 = 729$\n\nThen, let's multiply 729 by 9 to get the next power:\n\n- $9^4 = 729 \\times 9 = 6561$\n\nAs we can see, the pattern holds true. The units digit of the powers of 9 is indeed cycling in a pattern of 2. \n\nWhen we take this pattern into consideration, we can find the units digit of $9^{2004}$. Since the units digit repeats every 2 powers, we can find the remainder of $2004$ when divided by $2$:\n\n- $2004 \\div 2 = 1002$ with no remainder.\n\nSince there is no remainder, the units digit of $9^{2004}$ is the same as the units digit of $9^2$, which is 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the tens digit of $9^{2004}$. For that, we'll look at the last two digits of the powers of 9:\n\n- $9^1 = 09$\n- $9^2 = 81$\n- $9^3 = 29$\n- $9^4 = 61$\n\nWe can observe that the tens digit of the powers of 9 repeat in a cycle of 4: 0, 8, 2, 6. \n\nTo verify this pattern, let's multiply the last two digits of each power by 9:\n\n- $09 \\times 9 = 81$\n- $81 \\times 9 = 29$\n- $29 \\times 9 = 61$\n- $61 \\times 9 = 49$\n\nAs we can see, the pattern holds true. The tens digit of the powers of 9 is indeed cycling in a pattern of 4.\n\nWhen we take this pattern into consideration, we can find the tens digit of $9^{2004}$. Since the tens digit repeats every 4 powers, we can find the remainder of $2004$ when divided by $4$:\n\n- $2004 \\div 4 = 501$ remainder 0.\n\nSince there is no remainder, the tens digit of $9^{2004}$ is the same as the tens digit of $9^4$, which is 6.\n\nNow that we have the tens and units digits of $9^{2004}$, we can find their sum:\n\n- Tens digit: 6\n- Units digit: 1\n\nThe sum of the tens and units digit of $9^{2004}$ is 7.\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
