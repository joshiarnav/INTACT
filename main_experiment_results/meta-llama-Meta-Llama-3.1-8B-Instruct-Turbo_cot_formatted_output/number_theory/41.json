    "problem": "If $k$ and $\\ell$ are positive 4-digit integers such that $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$, what is the smallest possible value for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]$?",
    "solution": "The identity $\\gcd(k,\\ell)\\cdot\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = k\\ell$ holds for all positive integers $k$ and $\\ell$. Thus, we have $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = \\frac{k\\ell}{3}.$$Also, $k$ and $\\ell$ must be 4-digit multiples of $3$, so our choices for each are $$1002,1005,1008,1011,1014,\\ldots,$$and by minimizing the product $k\\ell$, we minimize the least common multiple of $k$ and $\\ell$. However, $k$ and $\\ell$ cannot both be $1002$, since their greatest common divisor would then be $1002$ (not $3$). Setting $k=1002$ and $\\ell=1005$, we obtain $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$ as desired, and we obtain the smallest possible value for the least common multiple: \\begin{align*}\n\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[1002,1005] &= \\frac{1002\\cdot 1005}{3} \\\\\n&= 1002\\cdot 335 \\\\\n&= (1000\\cdot 335)+(2\\cdot 335)\\\\\n&= \\boxed{335{,}670}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest possible value for the least common multiple (LCM) of $k$ and $\\ell$, we need to consider the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM.\n\nGiven $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$, we know that $k$ and $\\ell$ share a common factor of 3. Also, $k$ and $\\ell$ are 4-digit integers.\n\nTo find the smallest possible value of LCM, we want to minimize the values of $k$ and $\\ell$ while still satisfying the condition $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$.\n\nOne way to achieve this is to consider the smallest 4-digit integers that are multiples of 3. These would be $1002$, $1005$, $1008$, etc. However, we need to ensure that the GCD of these numbers is 3.\n\nLet's consider the numbers $1002$ and $1005$. The GCD of $1002$ and $1005$ is indeed 3, because both numbers are multiples of 3 and share no other common factors.\n\nNow, we can find the LCM of $1002$ and $1005$ using the formula $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell]=\\frac{k\\ell}{\\gcd(k,\\ell)}$. \n\nSubstituting the values of $k$, $\\ell$, and $\\gcd(k,\\ell)$, we get:\n\n$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[1002,1005]=\\frac{1002\\cdot 1005}{3}$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[1002,1005]=\\frac{1007010}{3}$\n\n$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[1002,1005]=334670$\n\nSo, the smallest possible value for the LCM of $k$ and $\\ell$ is $\\boxed{334670}$."
