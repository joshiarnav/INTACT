    "model_solution": "To solve the problem, we first need to find the value of x that satisfies both congruences. \n\nGiven $4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$, we can simplify it by dividing both sides by 4. However, we must also divide the modulus 20 by 4. Since 4 is not a factor of 20, we can't simplify the modulus directly.\n\nHowever we can simplify by dividing both the left and right side by 4 (due to 4 being a factor of the left-hand side). \n\n$4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$ simplifies to $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$\n\nGiven $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$, we can try to find a solution by inspection or by using the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nWe can also try to find a solution by inspection.\n\nNow, to check the solution for both equations we can plug the value of x into both equations and see if it satisfies both of them.\n\nSince $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$ is the simplified congruence from the first equation, we can try to see if this value satisfies the second equation. \n\nSubstituting x = 2 into the second equation, we get:\n\n$3(2) \\equiv 6\\pmod{20}$ which does not satisfy the congruence $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$.\n\nHowever, to find the value of x that satisfies both equations, we can try to find an x that satisfies both congruences by inspection.\n\nFrom the simplified first congruence $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$, we can try values of x that are 2 more than a multiple of 5.\n\nFor the second equation, we need to find a value of x such that $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$.\n\nWe can try values of x that are 2 more than a multiple of 5 until we find a value that satisfies the second equation.\n\nAfter some trial and error, we find that x = 12 satisfies both congruences.\n\nNow, to find the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by 20, we can plug x = 12 into the equation:\n\n$x^2 = 12^2 = 144$\n\nTo find the remainder when 144 is divided by 20, we can divide 144 by 20:\n\n$144\\div20=7$ r 4\n\nSo, the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by 20 is $\\boxed{4}$."
