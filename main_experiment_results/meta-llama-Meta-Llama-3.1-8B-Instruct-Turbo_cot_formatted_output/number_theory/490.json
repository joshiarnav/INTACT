    "problem": "When $\\frac{3}{1250}$ is written as a decimal, how many zeros are there between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit?",
    "solution": "Rather than doing long division, we will write the given fraction to have a denominator of the form $10^b=2^b \\cdot 5^b$, where $b$ is a positive integer. First, we write $\\dfrac{3}{1250}$ as $\\dfrac{3}{2^1 \\cdot 5^4}$. To make the denominator fit the form $2^b \\cdot 5^b$, we make $b$ the larger of the two exponents, which in this case is $4$. Thus, we have $$\\frac{3}{5^4 \\cdot 2^1} \\cdot \\frac{2^3}{2^3}=\\frac{3 \\cdot 2^3}{5^4 \\cdot 2^4} = \\frac{24}{10^4}$$The exponent in the denominator is $4$, and $24$ are the last two digits. Therefore, there are $4-2=\\boxed{2}$ zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit.",

    "model_solution": "To convert $\\frac{3}{1250}$ to a decimal, we need to convert it to a fraction with a denominator of the form $10^b$ (where $b$ is a non-negative integer).\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of 1250: \n$1250 = 2 \\cdot 5^4$\n\nWe can rewrite $\\frac{3}{1250}$ as $\\frac{3 \\cdot 2^3}{2^3 \\cdot 5^4} = \\frac{24}{2^3 \\cdot 5^4} = \\frac{24}{10^3 \\cdot 5}$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the fraction with a denominator of the form $10^b$ by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by $5^3$:\n$\\frac{24}{10^3 \\cdot 5} \\cdot \\frac{5^3}{5^3} = \\frac{24 \\cdot 5^3}{10^3 \\cdot 5^4} = \\frac{1200}{10^7}$\n\nSo, we have $\\frac{3}{1250} = \\frac{1200}{10^7}$.\n\nNow, let's divide 1200 by $10^7$ to get the decimal form of $\\frac{3}{1250}$:\n$\\frac{1200}{10^7} = 0.00012$\n\nThere are 4 zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{4}$."
