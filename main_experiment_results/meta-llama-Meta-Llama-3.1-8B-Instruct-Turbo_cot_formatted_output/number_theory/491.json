    "solution": "Marcus has two equations: \\[a=45n+37\\]and \\[b=30m+9.\\]When he adds these he gets \\[a+b=45n+30m+37+9=15(3n+2m)+46=15(3n+2m+3)+1.\\]The remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15 is $\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15, we first need to express $a$ and $b$ in terms of 45 and 30, respectively, along with their remainders.\n\nGiven that when Marcus divides $a$ by 45 he gets a remainder of 37, we can express $a$ as:\n$a = 45k + 37$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nSimilarly, given that when Marcus divides $b$ by 30 he gets a remainder of 9, we can express $b$ as:\n$b = 30m + 9$, where $m$ is an integer.\n\nNow, let's add $a$ and $b$:\n$a+b = (45k + 37) + (30m + 9)$\n$a+b = 45k + 30m + 46$\n\nTo simplify this expression and make it easier to divide by 15, let's rewrite 46 in terms of 15:\n$46 = 15 \\times 3 + 1$\n\nSo, we can rewrite $a+b$ as:\n$a+b = 45k + 30m + 15 \\times 3 + 1$\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n$a+b = 15(3k + 2m) + 1$\n\nNow, when we divide $a+b$ by 15, the term $15(3k + 2m)$ will be perfectly divisible by 15 with a remainder of 0.\n\nThe remaining term, which is 1, will be the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is $\\boxed{1}$."
