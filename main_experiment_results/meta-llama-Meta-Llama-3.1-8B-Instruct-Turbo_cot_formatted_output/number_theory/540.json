    "problem": "What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}?$",
    "solution": "First, we simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$ to $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, we have $$17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$This means that $17n$ can be written in the form $7a+2$, where $a$ is an integer. So we have $17n=7a+2$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\\frac{7a+2}{17}=n$ is an integer. By trying values for $a$, we find that the smallest integer $a$ which satisfies the equation is $7$. Therefore, the least value for $n$ is $\\frac{51}{17}=\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$, we first need to simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$. \n\nWe can do this by finding the remainder when 1234 is divided by 7:\n\n$1234 \\div 7 = 176$ with a remainder of 2.\n\nSo, $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nNow, we have the equation $17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. \n\nTo solve for $n$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 17 modulo 7. \n\nHowever, we can simplify this by realizing that $17 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ because $17 \\div 7 = 2$ with a remainder of 3.\n\nNow, we have $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nTo find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 7, we can try the multiples of 3 until we find one that is congruent to 1 modulo 7.\n\nStarting with $n = 1$, we have $3n = 3 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nTrying $n = 2$, we have $3n = 6 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nTrying $n = 3$, we have $3n = 9 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, which is not the inverse we're looking for.\n\nTrying $n = 4$, we have $3n = 12 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nTrying $n = 5$, we have $3n = 15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nSo, the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 7 is 5.\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the equation $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$ by 5:\n\n$5 \\times 3n \\equiv 5 \\times 2 \\pmod{7}$\n\n$15n \\equiv 10 \\pmod{7}$\n\nSince $15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$ and $10 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$, we have:\n\n$n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nThe smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies this equation is $\\boxed{3}$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{3}$."
