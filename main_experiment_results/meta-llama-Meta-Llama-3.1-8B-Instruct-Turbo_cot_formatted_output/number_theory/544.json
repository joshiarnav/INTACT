    "problem": "When Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 5, she has 3 remaining, and when she divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 remaining. If Claire has fewer than 60 cupcakes, what is the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that she could have?",
    "solution": "If Claire has $N$ cupcakes, we know that $N = 5x+3$ and $N = 7y+4$ for some integers $x$ and $y$. Equating these two forms of $N$, we have $7y+1=5x$. We also know that $N<60$. We can write out all the sufficiently small possible values of $7y+1$: $$1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57.$$Of these, the numbers that are also of the form $5x$ are $15$ and $50$. These correspond to solutions $N=18,$ $N=53$. Thus, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes is $53+18 = \\boxed{71}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. When Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 5, she has 3 remaining. This means that the total number of cupcakes she has is 3 more than a multiple of 5. We can represent this as:\n   n = 5k + 3\n\n2. When Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 remaining. This means that the total number of cupcakes she has is 4 more than a multiple of 7. We can represent this as:\n   n = 7m + 4\n\n3. Since both equations represent the same situation (the number of cupcakes Claire has), we can set them equal to each other:\n   5k + 3 = 7m + 4\n\n4. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n   5k - 7m = 1\n\n5. This is a linear Diophantine equation, and we need to find the solutions where k and m are integers. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the solution.\n\n6. First, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5 and 7 using the Euclidean algorithm:\n   7 = 1(5) + 2\n   5 = 2(2) + 1\n   2 = 1(2) + 0\n   GCD(5, 7) = 1\n\n7. Now, we can rewrite the equation as:\n   5k - 7m = 1\n\n8. Since the GCD is 1, there is a unique solution modulo the GCD. We can find the solution using the Extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\n9. The solution to the linear Diophantine equation is:\n   k = 3 + 7t\n   m = 2 + 5t\n\n10. Substituting these values back into the equation n = 5k + 3, we get:\n    n = 5(3 + 7t) + 3\n    n = 18 + 35t\n\n11. Since Claire has fewer than 60 cupcakes, we need to find the possible values of n that satisfy this condition. We can do this by trying different values of t and checking if n is less than 60.\n\n12. Trying t = 0, we get n = 18 + 35(0) = 18, which is less than 60.\n   Trying t = 1, we get n = 18 + 35(1) = 53, which is less than 60.\n   Trying t = 2, we get n = 18 + 35(2) = 88, which is greater than 60.\n\n13. Therefore, the possible quantities of cupcakes that Claire could have are 18 and 53.\n\n14. To find the sum of all possible quantities, we add 18 and 53 together:\n   18 + 53 = 71\n\nSo, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that Claire could have is $\\boxed{71}$."
