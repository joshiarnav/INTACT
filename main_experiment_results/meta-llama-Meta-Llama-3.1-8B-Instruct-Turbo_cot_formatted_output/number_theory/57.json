    "problem": "When three positive integers are divided by $24$, the remainders are $10,$ $4,$ and $12,$ respectively.\n\nWhen the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, what is the remainder?",
    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 10\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 12\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 10+4+12 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $24$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24, we can start by representing the three integers based on the given remainders when divided by 24.\n\nLet's denote the three integers as $a, b,$ and $c$. We can write them as:\n\n- $a = 24p + 10$ (where $p$ is some integer)\n- $b = 24q + 4$ (where $q$ is some integer)\n- $c = 24r + 12$ (where $r$ is some integer)\n\nNow, we are interested in finding the sum of these integers, which is $a + b + c$. \n\nLet's add the expressions for $a, b,$ and $c$:\n\n$a + b + c = (24p + 10) + (24q + 4) + (24r + 12)$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$a + b + c = 24p + 24q + 24r + 26$\n\nNow, we can factor out the common factor of 24:\n\n$a + b + c = 24(p + q + r) + 26$\n\nTo find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24, we need to focus on the remainder of 26 when divided by 24. \n\nWhen 26 is divided by 24, the remainder is 2.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24 is $\\boxed{2}$."
