    "solution": "In order to find the product of the two, we first convert both values into base 10. We have that $1001_2=1(2^3)+0(2^2)+0(2^1)+1(2^0)=8+1=9$, and that $121_3=1(3^2)+2(3^1)+1(3^0)=9+6+1=16$. The product of the two is just $(9)(16)=\\boxed{144}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we first need to convert both numbers to base 10.\n\n**Step 1: Convert $1001_2$ to base 10**\n\nThe number $1001_2$ is in binary (base 2). To convert it to base 10, we need to multiply each digit by the corresponding power of 2 and add them up.\n\n- The rightmost digit (1) is multiplied by $2^0 = 1$.\n- The next digit to the left (0) is multiplied by $2^1 = 2$.\n- The next digit to the left (0) is multiplied by $2^2 = 4$.\n- The leftmost digit (1) is multiplied by $2^3 = 8$.\n\nSo, the conversion is:\n\n$1 \\times 2^0 + 0 \\times 2^1 + 0 \\times 2^2 + 1 \\times 2^3$\n$= 1 + 0 + 0 + 8$\n$= 9$\n\nTherefore, $1001_2 = 9$ in base 10.\n\n**Step 2: Convert $121_3$ to base 10**\n\nThe number $121_3$ is in ternary (base 3). To convert it to base 10, we need to multiply each digit by the corresponding power of 3 and add them up.\n\n- The rightmost digit (1) is multiplied by $3^0 = 1$.\n- The next digit to the left (2) is multiplied by $3^1 = 3$.\n- The leftmost digit (1) is multiplied by $3^2 = 9$.\n\nSo, the conversion is:\n\n$1 \\times 3^0 + 2 \\times 3^1 + 1 \\times 3^2$\n$= 1 + 6 + 9$\n$= 16$\n\nTherefore, $121_3 = 16$ in base 10.\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the two numbers**\n\nNow that we have both numbers in base 10, we can multiply them:\n\n$9 \\times 16 = 144$\n\nTherefore, the product of $1001_2$ and $121_3$ in base 10 is:\n\n$\\boxed{144}$"
