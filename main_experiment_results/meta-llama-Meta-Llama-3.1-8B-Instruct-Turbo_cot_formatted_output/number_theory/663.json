    "problem": "Suppose that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are non-zero distinct digits less than $6$, and suppose we have ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$ and ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$. Find the three-digit number ${ABC}$. (Interpret $AB_6$ as a base-6 number with digits $A$ and $B$, not as $A$ times $B$. The other expressions should be interpreted in this way as well).",
    "solution": "Dealing with the second condition, it is set up in the following manner. $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&&C_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&0_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$Because $B+C$ can not equal $0$, we must carry in this column. Therefore, we arrive at two equations. $B+C-6=0$ and $A+1=C$ Looking at the third condition: $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&B&A_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&C_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$We can determine that no carrying occurs. Therefore, $A+B=C$. We now have a system of equations for our three variables. \\[B+C-6=0\\]\\[A+1=C\\]\\[A+B=C\\]Subtracting the third equation from the second, $1-B=0$, or $B=1$. Plugging that into our first equation we can determine that $C=5$. $A$ must then equal $4$. Thus, $\\overline{ABC}$ is $\\boxed{415}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.\n\nFrom the given equations, we have:\n\n1. ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$\n2. ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$\n\nFirst, let's analyze the units digit in each equation.\n\nFor equation 1, we know that $B + C$ must end in $0$ in base 6. In base 6, the only number that ends in $0$ is $0$ itself or $6$. However, since $C$ is a non-zero digit and $B+C$ must end in $0$, we know that $B+C = 6$ (in base 10). Since $B$ and $C$ are distinct digits less than $6$, the only possible combinations are $(B, C) = (1, 5)$ or $(5, 1)$.\n\nNow, let's look at the tens digit in each equation.\n\nFor equation 1, we know that $A+C$ must be less than $6$ because the result in the tens place is $C$. However, we already know that $B+C=6$, so we have two equations:\n\n- $A+C < 6$\n- $B+C=6$\n\nSince $B+C=6$, we know that $A+C$ cannot be $5$ because that would leave no value for $A$ or $C$. Therefore, $A+C < 5$.\n\nFor equation 2, we know that $B+A = C$.\n\nLet's consider the possible combinations for $(A, B, C)$:\n\n1. $(1, 5, 6)$ is not possible because $A + B = 6$ cannot be true in base 6 for $A, B < 6$.\n2. $(5, 1, 6)$ is not possible for the same reason.\n3. $(1, 5, 5)$ is not possible because $1+5 \\neq 5$.\n4. $(5, 1, 1)$ is not possible for the same reason.\n5. $(5, 1, 6)$ and $(1, 5, 6)$ are possible because we had already found that $B+C=6$.\n6. Let's consider the case where $A = 1, B = 5$:\n   - From the second equation, we have $B+A = C$, so $1+5 = 6$.\n   - However, we already know that $B+C=6$ in base 10, which means that the $6$ we found in the previous step is actually $10$, not base 6.\n   \n   Let's consider the case where $A = 5, B = 1$:\n   - From the second equation, we have $B+A = C$, so $5+1 = 10$ in base 6, which is $6$ in base 10. \n   - However, in base 6, we found that $B+C=6$, which is $10$ in base 6, and we also have $A+C<5$, so $5+C<5$ which is impossible because $C$ is a non-zero digit.\n\nHowever, if we let $A = 5$ and $B = 1$, we can use the fact that $5+1 = 10$ in base 6 to get $C = 6$ in base 10, which is $10$ in base 6.\n\nHowever, we cannot have $C=10$ because we are working in base 6, and $C$ must be less than $6$.\n\nLet's consider the case where $A = 5, B = 5$:\n   - From the second equation, we have $B+A = C$, so $5+5 = 14$ in base 10, which is $22$ in base 6. \n   - However, we already know that $A+C<5$, so $5+C<5$ which is impossible because $C$ is a non-zero digit.\n\nHowever, if we let $A = 5, B = 4$ (not 5 because $A$ and $B$ must be distinct), we have:\n   - $A+B = 5+4 = 13$ in base 10, which is $21$ in base 6.\n   - From the second equation, we have $B+A = C$, so $5+4 = 21$ in base 6, which is $13$ in base 10.\n   - However, in the first equation, we know that $A+B+C = 10$ in base 6, so $A+B+C = 6$ in base 10.\n   - We already have $A+B = 13$ in base 10, and we have $C = 13 - (A+B) = 13 - 13 = 0$ in base 10, which is $0$ in base 6.\n   \n   However, we cannot have $C = 0$ because $C$ must be a non-zero digit.\n\nHowever, if we let $A = 4, B = 5$:\n   - From the second equation, we have $B+A = C$, so $5+4 = 13$ in base 10, which is $21$ in base 6.\n   - However, in the first equation, we know that $A+B+C = 10$ in base 6, so $A+B+C = 6$ in base 10.\n   - We already have $A+B = 13$ in base 10, and we have $C = 13 - (A+B) = 13 - 13 = 0$ in base 10, which is $0$ in base 6.\n   \n   However, we cannot have $C = 0$ because $C$ must be a non-zero digit.\n\nHowever, if we let $A = 4, B = 1$:\n   - $A+B = 4+1 = 5$ in base 10, which is $5$ in base 6.\n   - From the second equation, we have $B+A = C$, so $1+4 = 10$ in base 6, which is $5$ in base 10.\n   - In the first equation, we have $A+B+C = 10$ in base 6, so $A+B+C = 6$ in base 10.\n   - We already have $A+B = 5$ in base 10, and we have $C = 6 - (A+B) = 6 - 5 = 1$ in base 10, which is $1$ in base 6.\n\nNow that we have $A = 4, B = 1, C = 1$, we can form the three-digit number ${ABC}$.\n\nTherefore, the three-digit number ${ABC}$ is $\\boxed{411}$."
