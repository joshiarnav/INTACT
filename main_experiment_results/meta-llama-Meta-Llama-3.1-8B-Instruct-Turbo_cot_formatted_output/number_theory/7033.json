    "problem": "The number $r$ can be expressed as a four-place decimal $0.abcd,$ where $a, b, c,$ and $d$ represent digits, any of which could be zero. It is desired to approximate $r$ by a fraction whose numerator is 1 or 2 and whose denominator is an integer. The closest such fraction to $r$ is $\\frac 27.$ What is the number of possible values for $r$?\n",
    "solution": "The nearest fractions to $\\frac 27$ with numerator $1$ are $\\frac 13, \\frac 14$; and with numerator $2$ are $\\frac 26, \\frac 28 = \\frac 13, \\frac 14$ anyway. For $\\frac 27$ to be the best approximation for $r$, the decimal must be closer to $\\frac 27 \\approx .28571$ than to $\\frac 13 \\approx .33333$ or $\\frac 14 \\approx .25$.\nThus $r$ can range between $\\frac{\\frac 14 + \\frac{2}{7}}{2} \\approx .267857$ and $\\frac{\\frac 13 + \\frac{2}{7}}{2} \\approx .309523$. At $r = .2679, .3095$, it becomes closer to the other fractions, so $.2679 \\le r \\le .3095$ and the number of values of $r$ is $3095 - 2679 + 1 = \\boxed{417}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of possible values for $r$, we need to determine the range of $r$ that makes $\\frac{2}{7}$ the closest fraction of the form $\\frac{1}{n}$ or $\\frac{2}{n}$, where $n$ is an integer.\n\nFirst, let's consider the fractions $\\frac{1}{n}$ and $\\frac{2}{n}$. We want to find the range of values of $r$ such that $\\frac{2}{7}$ is closest to it compared to any other fraction of the form $\\frac{1}{n}$ or $\\frac{2}{n}$.\n\nWe start by comparing the fractions with the same denominator. For $\\frac{1}{n}$, the closest fractions to $\\frac{2}{7}$ are $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. Since $\\frac{2}{7}$ is between $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$, we can conclude that $n$ should be between $3$ and $4$. \n\nFor $\\frac{2}{n}$, the closest fractions to $\\frac{2}{7}$ are $\\frac{2}{6}$ and $\\frac{2}{8}$. Since $\\frac{2}{7}$ is between $\\frac{2}{6}$ and $\\frac{2}{8}$, we can conclude that $n$ should be between $6$ and $8$.\n\nCombining the two ranges, we find that $n$ should be between $3$ and $8$. \n\nNow, we need to determine the possible values of $r$ that make $\\frac{2}{7}$ the closest fraction to it. To do this, we calculate the decimal expansions of $\\frac{1}{n}$ and $\\frac{2}{n}$ for $n$ between $3$ and $8$.\n\n| $n$ | $\\frac{1}{n}$ | $\\frac{2}{n}$ |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 3   | 0.3333...     | 0.6666...     |\n| 4   | 0.25          | 0.5           |\n| 5   | 0.2           | 0.4           |\n| 6   | 0.1666...     | 0.3333...     |\n| 7   | 0.1428...     | 0.2857...     |\n| 8   | 0.125         | 0.25          |\n\nWe are looking for values of $r$ such that $\\frac{2}{7}$ is the closest fraction to it. \n\nThe distance between a fraction and $\\frac{2}{7}$ can be calculated using the absolute value of the difference between their decimal expansions. \n\n| $n$ | $\\left| \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{2}{7} \\right|$ | $\\left| \\frac{2}{n} - \\frac{2}{7} \\right|$ |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 3   | 0.0467 (larger)  | 0.0333 (smaller)  |\n| 4   | 0.0667 (larger)  | 0.0333 (smaller)  |\n| 5   | 0.0467 (smaller) | 0.0667 (larger)  |\n| 6   | 0.0667 (larger)  | 0.0467 (smaller)  |\n| 7   | 0.0445 (smaller) | 0.0657 (larger)  |\n| 8   | 0.0667 (larger)  | 0.0445 (smaller)  |\n\nBased on the distances, the closest fractions to $\\frac{2}{7}$ are $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{2}{8}$ for $r$ in $(0.2857, 0.3333)$, $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{2}{6}$ for $r$ in $(0.3333, 0.4)$, and $\\frac{2}{7}$ for $r$ in $(0.3333, 0.4)$.\n\nThe possible values of $r$ are in the ranges $(0.2857, 0.3333)$ and $(0.3333, 0.4)$.\n\nSince we are given that $r$ can be expressed as a four-place decimal $0.abcd$, the possible values are in the range $(0.2857, 0.3333)$ and $(0.3333, 0.4)$. We can convert these to the range of four-place decimals.\n\nWe get that the range of possible values for $r$ is $(0.2857, 0.3333)$ and $(0.3333, 0.4)$.\n\nSince we are looking for the number of possible values for $r$, we can determine the length of the range.\n\nThe length of the range $(0.2857, 0.3333)$ is $0.3333-0.2857=0.0476$.\n\nThe length of the range $(0.3333, 0.4)$ is $0.4-0.3333=0.0667$.\n\nThe total length of the range is $0.0476+0.0667=0.1143$.\n\nSince the decimal expansion of $r$ has four digits, we can divide $0.1143$ by $0.0001$ to find the number of possible values for $r$.\n\n$\\frac{0.1143}{0.0001} = 1143.$"
