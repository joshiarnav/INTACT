    "problem": "Call a positive integer $N$ a 7-10 double if the digits of the base-$7$ representation of $N$ form a base-$10$ number that is twice $N$. For example, $51$ is a 7-10 double because its base-$7$ representation is $102$. What is the largest 7-10 double?\n",
    "solution": "We let $N_7 = \\overline{a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0}_7$; we are given that\n\\[2(a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_7 = (a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_{10}\\](This is because the digits in $N$ ' s base 7 representation make a number with the same digits in base 10 when multiplied by 2)\nExpanding, we find that\n\\[2 \\cdot 7^n a_n + 2 \\cdot 7^{n-1} a_{n-1} + \\cdots + 2a_0 = 10^na_n + 10^{n-1}a_{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0\\]\nor re-arranging,\n\\[a_0 + 4a_1 = 2a_2 + 314a_3 + \\cdots + (10^n - 2 \\cdot 7^n)a_n\\]\nSince the $a_i$s are base-$7$ digits, it follows that $a_i < 7$, and the LHS is less than or equal to $30$. Hence our number can have at most $3$ digits in base-$7$. Letting $a_2 = 6$, we find that $630_7 = \\boxed{315}_{10}$ is our largest 7-10 double.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest 7-10 double, we need to find the largest number $N$ such that the digits of its base-7 representation form a base-10 number that is twice $N$.\n\nLet's denote the base-7 representation of $N$ as $d_nd_{n-1}...d_1d_0$, where each $d_i$ is a digit in base-7.\n\nIn base-10, the value of $N$ can be represented as:\n\n$$N = d_n(7^n) + d_{n-1}(7^{n-1}) + \\cdots + d_1(7) + d_0$$\n\nNow, let's consider the base-10 number formed by the digits of the base-7 representation of $N$. This number is:\n\n$$d_nd_{n-1}...d_1d_0$$\n\nSince this base-10 number is twice $N$, we can write:\n\n$$d_nd_{n-1}...d_1d_0 = 2N$$\n\nSubstituting the base-7 representation of $N$, we get:\n\n$$d_nd_{n-1}...d_1d_0 = 2(d_n(7^n) + d_{n-1}(7^{n-1}) + \\cdots + d_1(7) + d_0)$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$d_nd_{n-1}...d_1d_0 = 2d_n(7^n) + 2d_{n-1}(7^{n-1}) + \\cdots + 2d_1(7) + 2d_0$$\n\nNow, we need to find the largest value of $N$ that satisfies this equation.\n\nSince the base-7 representation of $N$ is $d_nd_{n-1}...d_1d_0$, we know that each $d_i$ is a digit in base-7, so $0 \\leq d_i \\leq 6$ for $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, n-1$.\n\nMoreover, since the base-10 number formed by the digits of the base-7 representation of $N$ is twice $N$, we know that $d_nd_{n-1}...d_1d_0 \\geq 2N$.\n\nLet's consider the possible digits for $d_n$. Since $d_n$ is a digit in base-7, we know that $d_n \\leq 6$.\n\nIf $d_n = 6$, then the base-10 number formed by the digits of the base-7 representation of $N$ is:\n\n$$d_nd_{n-1}...d_1d_0 = 6\\cdot 7^n + \\cdots + d_1(7) + d_0$$\n\nSince this base-10 number is twice $N$, we have:\n\n$$6\\cdot 7^n + \\cdots + d_1(7) + d_0 = 2(d_n(7^n) + d_{n-1}(7^{n-1}) + \\cdots + d_1(7) + d_0)$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$5\\cdot 7^n = 2d_{n-1}(7^{n-1}) + \\cdots + 2d_1(7) + 2d_0$$\n\nSince $5\\cdot 7^n$ is a multiple of $7^2$, we know that $2d_{n-1}(7^{n-1}) + \\cdots + 2d_1(7) + 2d_0$ is also a multiple of $7^2$.\n\nHowever, since $2d_i(7)$ is not a multiple of $7^2$ for any $d_i \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, 6\\}$, we know that $2d_{n-1}(7^{n-1}) + \\cdots + 2d_1(7) + 2d_0$ cannot be a multiple of $7^2$ unless $n-1 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, we must have $n = 1$, and the base-7 representation of $N$ is $d_1d_0$.\n\nSince $d_n = 6$, we know that $d_1 \\leq 6$.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values for $d_0$. Since $d_0 = 2d_0 + 2d_1(7)$, we have:\n\n$$d_0 = 2(d_1(7) + d_0)$$\n\nSolving for $d_0$, we get:\n\n$$d_0 = 2(d_1(7))$$\n\nSince $d_1 \\leq 6$, we have $d_1(7) \\leq 42$, so $d_0 \\leq 84$.\n\nHowever, since $d_0$ is a digit in base-7, we know that $d_0 \\leq 6$.\n\nTherefore, we must have $d_0 = 0$ or $d_0 = 7$, but this is impossible, since $d_0$ is a digit in base-7.\n\nTherefore, we have a contradiction, and there is no solution when $d_n = 6$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where $d_n = 5$. We can use the same argument as above to show that there is no solution.\n\nSimilarly, we can show that there is no solution when $d_n = 4$, $d_n = 3$, or $d_n = 2$.\n\nFinally, let's consider the case where $d_n = 1$. We have:\n\n$$d_nd_{n-1}...d_1d_0 = 2(d_n(7^n) + d_{n-1}(7^{n-1}) + \\cdots + d_1(7) + d_0)$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$d_n(7^n) + d_{n-1}(7^{n-1}) + \\cdots + d_1(7) + d_0 = 2d_n(7^n) + 2d_{n-1}(7^{n-1}) + \\cdots + 2d_1(7) + 2d_0$$\n\nSince $d_n = 1$, we have:\n\n$$d_{n-1}(7^{n-1}) + \\cdots + d_1(7) + d_0 = 2(d_{n-1}(7^{n-1}) + \\cdots + d_1(7) + d_0)$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$d_{n-1}(7^{n-1}) + \\cdots + d_1(7) + d_0 = 0$$\n\nTherefore, we must have $d_{n-1} = 0$, $d_{n-2} = 0$, $\\ldots$, $d_1 = 0$, and $d_0 = 0$.\n\nThis means that the base-7 representation of $N$ is $10$, and $N = 7^2 = \\boxed{49}$.\n\nTherefore, the largest 7-10 double is 49."
