    "solution": "Taking inspiration from $4^4 \\mid 10^{10}$ we are inspired to take $n$ to be $p^2$, the lowest prime not dividing $210$, or $11 \\implies n = 121$. Now, there are $242$ factors of $11$, so $11^{242} \\mid m^m$, and then $m = 11k$ for $k \\geq 22$. Now, $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = \\gcd(11+k,210) = 1$. Noting $k = 26$ is the minimal that satisfies this, we get $(n,m) = (121,286)$. Thus, it is easy to verify this is minimal and we get $\\boxed{407}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least possible value of $m+n$, we need to consider the given conditions and use them to our advantage.\n\n1. **gcd$(m+n, 210) = 1$**: This means that the sum of $m$ and $n$ should not be divisible by any prime factors of $210$. The prime factorization of $210$ is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. So, we should avoid combining $m$ and $n$ in such a way that their sum is divisible by $2$, $3$, $5$, or $7$.\n\n2. **$m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$**: This implies that $m^m \\ge n^n$. We can rearrange this inequality to get $\\left(\\frac{n}{m}\\right)^n \\le 1$. In general, if $a^n \\le 1$, then $|a| \\le 1$. In this case, since $n$ is a positive integer, $a = \\frac{n}{m}$. Therefore, we can conclude that $\\frac{n}{m} \\le 1$, or $m \\ge n$.\n\n3. **$m$ is not a multiple of $n$**: This condition is straightforward; $m$ and $n$ should not have a common factor greater than $1$.\n\nConsidering these conditions, we can now analyze the problem further. We want to minimize $m + n$, given that $m \\ge n$. Since $m$ is not a multiple of $n$, $m$ and $n$ must be relatively prime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is $1$).\n\nTo satisfy the condition $gcd(m+n, 210)=1$, we should try to find a suitable $n$ that has a factor from the prime factorization of $210$. Let's try $7$, as it is the largest prime factor of $210$. We can set $n = 7$. \n\nTo satisfy the condition $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$, we need $m^m \\ge 7^7$. We can find the smallest value of $m$ for which this is true by trial and error or by testing different values. We find that $m=14$ satisfies this condition.\n\nNow, we need to verify that $\\gcd(m+n, 210)=1$. We have $m = 14$ and $n = 7$. Therefore, $m + n = 21$. The prime factorization of $21$ is $3 \\cdot 7$. Since $21$ is not divisible by any of the prime factors of $210$ (i.e., $2$, $3$, $5$, or $7$), we can conclude that $\\gcd(21, 210) = 3 \\cdot 1 = 3$, which is not equal to $1$. This means that the values we found do not satisfy the conditions.\n\nTo satisfy the condition $\\gcd(m+n, 210)=1$, we need to try another value for $n$. Let's set $n=14$. In this case, we need to find the smallest value of $m$ for which $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$. We can see that $m = 2 \\cdot n = 2 \\cdot 14 = 28$ satisfies this condition.\n\nNow, we need to verify that $\\gcd(m+n, 210)=1$. We have $m = 28$ and $n = 14$. Therefore, $m + n = 42$. The prime factorization of $42$ is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$. Since $42$ is not divisible by any of the prime factors of $210$ (i.e., $2$, $3$, $5$, or $7$), we can conclude that $\\gcd(42, 210) = 1$, which satisfies the condition.\n\nWe also need to verify that $m$ is not a multiple of $n$. We have $m = 28$ and $n = 14$. Since $28$ is not a multiple of $14$, we can conclude that this condition is also satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the least possible value of $m+n$ is $\\boxed{42}$."
