    "problem": "For a positive integer $n$ and nonzero digits $a$, $b$, and $c$, let $A_n$ be the $n$-digit integer each of whose digits is equal to $a$; let $B_n$ be the $n$-digit integer each of whose digits is equal to $b$, and let $C_n$ be the $2n$-digit (not $n$-digit) integer each of whose digits is equal to $c$. What is the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$ for which there are at least two values of $n$ such that $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$?\n$\\textbf{(A)} \\text{ 12} \\qquad \\textbf{(B)} \\text{ 14} \\qquad \\textbf{(C)} \\text{ 16} \\qquad \\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 18} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)} \\text{ 20}$\n",
    "solution": "Observe $A_n = a(1 + 10 + \\dots + 10^{n - 1}) = a \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$; similarly $B_n = b \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ and $C_n = c \\cdot \\tfrac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}$. The relation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$ rewrites as\\[c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = a^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\right)^2.\\]Since $n > 0$, $10^n > 1$ and we may cancel out a factor of $\\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ to obtain\\[c \\cdot (10^n + 1) - b = a^2 \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}.\\]This is a linear equation in $10^n$. Thus, if two distinct values of $n$ satisfy it, then all values of $n$ will. Now we plug in $n=0$ and $n=1$ (or some other number), we get $2c - b = 0$ and $11c - b= a^2$ . Solving the equations for $c$ and $b$, we get\\[c = \\frac{a^2}{9} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c - b = -\\frac{a^2}{9} \\implies b = \\frac{2a^2}{9}.\\]To maximize $a + b + c = a + \\tfrac{a^2}{3}$, we need to maximize $a$. Since $b$ and $c$ must be integers, $a$ must be a multiple of $3$. If $a = 9$ then $b$ exceeds $9$. However, if $a = 6$ then $b = 8$ and $c = 4$ for an answer of $\\boxed{18}$.",

    "model_solution": "To start solving this problem, we need to understand how to represent $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$ in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$. The given expressions can be represented as follows:\n\n- $A_n = a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}$\n- $B_n = b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}$\n- $C_n = c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}$\n\nNow, we need to consider the equation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$. Substituting the expressions for $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$, we get:\n\n$$c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = \\left(a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\right)^2$$\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate the fractions. This gives us:\n\n$$c(10^{2n} - 1) - b(10^n - 1) = \\left(a(10^n - 1)\\right)^2$$\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation and the right side of the equation, we get a long expression in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get a condition that the equation must satisfy:\n$$(a^2 - ab - b)10^n + (ab - c) = 0$$\n\nFor the equation to be satisfied for at least two values of $n$, the coefficients of the powers of $10^n$ must be zero. This gives us two conditions:\n\n$$a^2 - ab - b = 0$$\n$$ab - c = 0$$\n\nWe need to solve these equations to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. To do this, we can rearrange the first equation to get $a^2 - ab = b$.\n\nRearranging the second equation, we get $ab = c$.\n\nNow, we need to consider all possible cases for the values of $a$ and $b$. We will analyze the possibilities one by one.\n\nCase 1: $a$ and $b$ are both 1\n\nIf $a$ and $b$ are both 1, we can substitute these values into the first equation and get $1 - 1 - 1 = 0$. This is a contradiction, so this case is not possible.\n\nCase 2: $a$ and $b$ are both 2\n\nIf $a$ and $b$ are both 2, we can substitute these values into the first equation and get $4 - 4 - 2 = 0$.

However, this leads to a contradiction when we try to find values of $n$ that satisfy the original equation, so this case is not possible.\n\nCase 4: $a$ and $b$ are both 4\n\nIf $a$ and $b$ are both 4, we can substitute these values into the first equation and get $16 - 16 - 4 = -4$, and the second condition $ab = c$ gives us $c = 16$. However, this leads to a contradiction when we try to find values of $n$ that satisfy the original  equation, so this case is not possible.\n\nCase 5: $a$ and $b$ are both 5\n\nIf $a$ and $b$ are both 5, we can substitute these values into the first equation and get $25 - 25 - 5 = -5$, and the second condition $ab = c$ gives us $c = 25$. This case works, so we have found a possible solution.\n\nCase 6: $a$ and $b$ are both 6\n\nIf $a$ and $b$ are both 6, we can substitute these values into the first equation and get $36 - 36 - 6 = -6$, and the second condition $ab = c$ gives us $c = 36$.

However, this leads to a contradiction when we try to find values of $n$ that satisfy the original equation, so this case is not possible.\n\nCase 8: $a$ and $b$ are both 8\n\nIf $a$ and $b$ are both 8, we can substitute these values into the first equation and get $64 - 64 - 8 = -8$, and the second condition $ab = c$ gives us $c = 64$. However, this leads to a contradiction when we try to find values of $n$ that satisfy the original equation, so this case is not possible.\n\nCase 9: $a$ and $b$ are both 9\n\nIf $a$ and $b$ are both 9, we can substitute these values into the first equation and get $81 - 81 - 9 = -9$, and the second condition $ab = c$ gives us $c = 81$.

However, this leads to a contradiction when we try to find values of $n$ that satisfy the original equation, so this case is not possible.\n\nCase 15: $a = 6$ and $b = 7$\n\nIf $a = 6$ and $b = 7$, we can substitute these values into the first equation and get $36 - 42 - 7 = -13 \\ne 0$, so this case is not possible.\n\nCase 16: $a = 6$ and $b = 8$\n\nIf $a = 6$ and $b = 8$, we can substitute these values into the first equation and get $36 - 48 - 8 = -20 \\ne 0$, so this case is not possible.\n\nCase 17: $a = 6$ and $b = 9$\n\nIf $a = 6$ and $b = 9$, we can substitute these values into the first equation and get $36 - 54 - 9 = -27 \\ne 0$, so this case is not possible.\n\nCase 18: $a = 7$ and $b = 5$\n\nIf $a = 7$ and $b = 5$, we can substitute these values into the first equation and get $49 - 35 - 5 = 9$, and the second condition $ab = c$ gives us $c = 35$.
