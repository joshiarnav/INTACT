This will be the same as the remainder when $-3737$ is divided by $8$, except we'll need to adjust our answer based on the sign.\n\nThe remainder when $3737$ is divided by $8$ is $1$. \n\nSince we're looking for $-3737 \\pmod{8}$, we can subtract $1$ from $8$, which is $7$, and then subtract $1$ again from that, since $-3737 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{8}$ and $-1$ is $1$ less than $0$ which is $8 - 1$."
