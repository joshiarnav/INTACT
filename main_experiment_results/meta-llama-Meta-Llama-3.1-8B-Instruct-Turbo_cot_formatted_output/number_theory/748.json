    "model_solution": "To find the value of $a$, we can start by setting up the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{a}{a+27} = 0.865$$\n\nSince $0.865$ is a decimal, we can convert it to a fraction to make the equation easier to work with. \n\nWe can multiply $0.865$ by $1000$ to get:\n\n$$\\frac{a}{a+27} = \\frac{865}{1000}$$\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply to get:\n\n$$a \\cdot 1000 = (a+27) \\cdot 865$$\n\nExpanding the right side of the equation gives:\n\n$$1000a = 865a + 23355$$\n\nSubtracting $865a$ from both sides gives:\n\n$$135a = 23355$$\n\nDividing both sides by $135$ gives:\n\n$$a = \\frac{23355}{135}$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $15$. \n\n$$a = \\frac{23355 \\div 15}{135 \\div 15}$$\n$$a = \\frac{1557}{9}$$\n\nNow that we have the value of $a$ in the form of a fraction, we can convert it to a decimal to see if it matches the original decimal of $0.865$. \n\n$$a = 173$$\n\nAs $a$ is a positive integer, we conclude that the value of $a$ is indeed $173$."
