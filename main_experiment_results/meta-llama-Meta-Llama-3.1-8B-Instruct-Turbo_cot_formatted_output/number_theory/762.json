    "model_solution": "To find the units digit of $n$, we first need to find the units digit of $21^6$. \n\nWhen a number is raised to a power, its units digit can be found by looking at the pattern of the units digits of its powers. The units digit of $21$ is $1$, and the units digit of powers of $1$ are always $1$. \n\nSo, the units digit of $21^6$ is $1$. \n\nNow, we know that $mn = 21^6$. The units digit of $mn$ is the product of the units digits of $m$ and $n$. \n\nThe units digit of $m$ is given as $7$. We need to find the units digit of $n$ such that when multiplied by $7$, the product is $1$. \n\nWe know that the units digit of the product of two numbers is $1$ if one of the units digits is $1$ and the other is $3$ (since $1 \\times 3 = 3$ and $3 \\times 1 = 3$, but $3$ has a units digit of $3$ and not $1$, so we'll ignore this case), $5$ (since $1 \\times 5 = 5$ and $5 \\times 1 = 5$), $9$ (since $1 \\times 9 = 9$ and $9 \\times 1 = 9$), or the unit digit of $n$ is $7$ and the other is $3$ (since $7 \\times 3 = 21$, which has a units digit of $1$). \n\nHowever, we cannot have the units digit of $n$ be $1$, since then $m$ would need to have a units digit of $1$ in order for the product $mn$ to have a units digit of $1$.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $n$ is the number that when multiplied by $7$ gives a product with a units digit of $1$. This is $3$, since $7 \\times 3 = 21$, which has a units digit of $1$.\n\nSo, the units digit of $n$ is $3$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{3}$."
