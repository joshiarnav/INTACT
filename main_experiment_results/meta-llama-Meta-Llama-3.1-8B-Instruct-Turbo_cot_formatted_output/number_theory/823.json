    "problem": "Kaleb defined a $\\emph{clever integer}$ as an even integer that is greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9. What fraction of all clever integers is divisible by 27? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "You can easily list out the numbers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add to 9: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.\n\nTo be a $\\emph{clever integer}$ the number must be even, which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, a total of 5 numbers.\n\nThe problem asks which fraction of these five clever integers are divisible by 27. Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the fraction of all clever integers that is divisible by 27, we need to find all the clever integers and then find which of those are divisible by 27.\n\nStep 1: Find the range of possible clever integers.\n\nThe clever integer must be greater than 20 and less than 120. It must be an even integer, so it is greater than 22 and less than 118. \n\nStep 2: Find all clever integers in the range.\n\nA clever integer must have a sum of digits equal to 9. We can list them down, starting with the smallest:\n\n- 27 is not even\n- 36 is even and works\n- 45 is not even\n- 54 is even and works\n- 63 is not even\n- 72 is even and works\n- 81 is not even\n- No more 2 digit combinations work\n- 108 is even, works\n- 117 is not even and also over 120\n\nNow we have all the clever integers in the range: 36, 54, 72, 108.\n\nStep 3: Find which clever integers are divisible by 27\n\nThe numbers that are divisible by 27 are 54 and 108.\n\nStep 4: Find the fraction of clever integers that is divisible by 27\n\nThere are 4 clever integers in total. None of them, except for 54 and 108, are divisible by 27, so 2 out of 4, are. So the fraction of clever integers that is divisible by 27 is $\\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$."
