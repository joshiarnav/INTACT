    "problem": "For some positive integer $k$, when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. What is the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$?",
    "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nGiven that when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6, we can write an equation:\n\n60 = $q$k^2 + 6\n\nwhere $q$ is the quotient of the division.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n\n60 - 6 = $q$k^2\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n54 = $q$k^2\n\nNow, we can factor 54 as:\n\n54 = 2 \u00d7 3^3\n\nSince $k^2$ divides 54, $k^2$ must be one of the factors of 54. \n\nThe factors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.\n\nWe know that $k^2$ cannot be 1, since $k$ is a positive integer. Also, $k^2$ cannot be 2, since 2 is not a square number.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $k^2$ are: 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.\n\nHowever, since the remainder is 6 when 60 is divided by $k^2$, $k^2$ must be greater than or equal to 9. \n\nThe possible values of $k^2$ are: 9, 18, 27, 54.\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$. We can try out the possible values of $k^2$ and find the corresponding value of $k$.\n\nIf $k^2$ = 9, then $k$ = 3.\n\n100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.\n\nIf $k^2$ = 18, then $k$ is not an integer.\n\nIf $k^2$ = 27, then $k$ is not an integer.\n\nIf $k^2$ = 54, then $k$ is not an integer.\n\nSo, the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$ is 1.\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
