    "model_solution": "To find the integer $n$, we first need to understand what $n \\equiv 7882 \\pmod{5}$ means. This is a modular arithmetic problem.\n\nThe expression $n \\equiv 7882 \\pmod{5}$ means that when 7882 is divided by 5, the remainder is the same as when $n$ is divided by 5.\n\nFirst, let's find the remainder when 7882 is divided by 5:\n\n7882 \u00f7 5 = 1576 with a remainder of 2\n\nSo, 7882 is congruent to 2 modulo 5.\n\nThis means we are looking for an integer $n$ such that $n$ is also congruent to 2 modulo 5, within the range $4 \\le n \\le 8$.\n\nTo find this integer, we can list the numbers in the given range and check which one is congruent to 2 modulo 5:\n\n- 4 modulo 5 is 4\n- 5 modulo 5 is 0\n- 6 modulo 5 is 1\n- 7 modulo 5 is 2\n- 8 modulo 5 is 3\n\nSo, the integer $n$ that satisfies the given condition is $n = 7$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
