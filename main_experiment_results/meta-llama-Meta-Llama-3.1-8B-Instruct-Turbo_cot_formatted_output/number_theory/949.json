    "problem": "The solution of $8x+1\\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$ is $x\\equiv a\\pmod{m}$ for some positive integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a<m$. Find $a+m$.",
    "solution": "Subtract 1 from both sides to obtain $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$. Add 12 to the right-hand side to get $8x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{12}$. Now divide both sides by 8, remembering to divide 12 by the greatest common factor of 12 and 8, thus obtaining $x \\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. This gives $a+m = 2 + 3 = \\boxed{5}$. Here we have used the fact that $ad \\equiv bd\\pmod{m}$ if and only if $a\\equiv b \\pmod{m/\\text{gcd}(m,d)}$, for integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a$, $b$, and $d$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve the given congruence, we need to isolate x. \n\nFirst, we need to subtract 1 from both sides of the equation: \n$8x + 1 - 1 \\equiv 5 - 1 \\pmod{12}$\n$8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$\n\nNow, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 8 modulo 12. In other words, we need to find a number x such that $8x\\equiv 1\\pmod{12}$. \n\nLet's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8 and 12. \nThe factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8 and the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. \nThe GCD of 8 and 12 is 4, so we need to divide both sides of the congruence by 4. \n\nHowever, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 8/4=2 modulo 12/4=3. We find the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 3 by testing numbers. Since 2*2=4 and 4 is 1 mod 3, the inverse is 2. \n\nNow, we multiply both sides of the congruence by the multiplicative inverse (which is 2): \n$8x\\equiv 4\\pmod{12}$\n$2*8x\\equiv 2*4\\pmod{12}$\n$16x\\equiv 8\\pmod{12}$ \n\n$16x\\equiv 8\\pmod{12}$ is equivalent to $4x\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. \n\nDividing both sides by 4 gives:\n$x\\equiv 1/2\\pmod{3}$\n\nHowever, we need to express this as x \u2261 a (mod m) for positive integers m \u2265 2 and a < m. \n\nSince 1/2 is equivalent to 2 mod 3, we have:\n$x\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$\n\nSo, a = 2 and m = 3. \n\nThe sum of a and m is a + m = 2 + 3 = 5. \n\nSo the final answer is:\n$\\boxed{5}$"
