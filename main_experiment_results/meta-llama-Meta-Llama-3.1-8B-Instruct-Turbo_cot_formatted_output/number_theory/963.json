    "problem": "The arithmetic progressions $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$ and $\\{3, 10, 17, 24, \\ldots \\}$ have some common values. What is the largest value less than 500 that they have in common?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be a common term. We know that \\begin{align*}\na&\\equiv 2\\pmod 3\\\\\na&\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer such that $a=2+3n$. Substituting this into $(2)$ yields \\[2+3n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 5\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $5$. Then $n\\ge 5\\implies a=2+3n\\ge 17$. $17$ satisfies the original congruences, so it is the smallest common term. Subtracting $17$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align*}\na-17&\\equiv -15\\equiv 0\\pmod 3\\nonumber\\\\\na-17&\\equiv -14\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\\nonumber\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,7)$, we get $a-17\\equiv 0\\pmod{3\\cdot 7}$, that is, $a\\equiv 17\\pmod{21}$.\n\nSo all common terms must be of the form $17+21m$ for some non-negative integer $m$. Note that any number of the form also satisfies the original congruences. The largest such number less than $500$ is $17+21\\cdot 22=\\boxed{479}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the common terms of the two arithmetic progressions, we first need to express the terms in terms of their respective first terms and common differences.\n\nFor the first arithmetic progression $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$, the first term $a_1 = 2$ and the common difference $d_1 = 3$. \n\nFor the second arithmetic progression $\\{3, 10, 17, 24, \\ldots \\}$, the first term $a_2 = 3$ and the common difference $d_2 = 7$.\n\nThe general formula to find the nth term of an arithmetic progression is $a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) d$.\n\nFor the first arithmetic progression, the nth term is $a_n = 2 + 3(n - 1)$, and for the second arithmetic progression, the nth term is $a_n = 3 + 7(n - 1)$.\n\nWe want to find common terms of the two sequences, so we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n\n$2 + 3(n - 1) = 3 + 7(n - 1)$\n\nExpanding both sides, we have:\n\n$2 + 3n - 3 = 3 + 7n - 7$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$3n - 1 = 7n - 4$\n\nSubtracting $3n$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$-1 = 4n - 4$\n\nAdding $4$ to both sides, we get:\n\n$3 = 4n$\n\nDividing both sides by $4$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{3}{4} = n$\n\nSince $n$ must be an integer, we know that $\\frac{3}{4}$ is not a valid solution.
