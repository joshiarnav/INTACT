    "problem": "Three different natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors. How many factors does $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ have?",
    "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$, we first need to understand what it means for a number to have exactly three natural-number factors. \n\nA natural number has exactly three factors if it is the square of a prime number. \n\nSo, let's assume that $x=p^2$, $y=q^2$, and $z=r^2$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are distinct prime numbers.\n\nNow, let's express $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ in terms of $p$, $q$, and $r$.\n$x^{2}y^{3}z^{4} = (p^2)^2(q^2)^3(r^2)^4$\n$x^{2}y^{3}z^{4} = p^4q^6r^8$\n\nThe number of factors of a number in the form $a^mb^n$, where $a$ and $b$ are prime numbers and $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, is $(m+1)(n+1)$.\n\nApplying this rule to $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4} = p^4q^6r^8$, we get:\n\nNumber of factors = $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)$\nNumber of factors = $5 \\times 7 \\times 9$\nNumber of factors = $315$\n\nSo, the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ is $\\boxed{315}$."
