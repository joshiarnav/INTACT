    "problem": "Natural numbers of the form $F_n=2^{2^n} + 1 $ are called Fermat numbers. In 1640, Fermat conjectured that all numbers $F_n$, where $n\\neq 0$, are prime. (The conjecture was later shown to be false.) What is the units digit of $F_{1000}$?",
    "solution": "Let's first try to find the cycle of units digits of $2^n$, starting with $n=1$: $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $2^n$ is 4 digits long: 2, 4, 8, 6. To find the units digit of $2^n$, for any positive integer $n$, we simply need to find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 2, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 4, etc.) Since $2^{1000}\\div4=2^{998}$ without remainder, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6. Therefore, the units digit of $F_n=2^{2^{1000}}+1$ is $6+1=\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the units digit of $F_{1000}$, we need to understand the pattern of units digits of powers of 2. \n\nLet's start by finding the units digits of $2^n$ for small values of $n$:\n\n- $2^1$ = 2 (units digit: 2)\n- $2^2$ = 4 (units digit: 4)\n- $2^3$ = 8 (units digit: 8)\n- $2^4$ = 16 (units digit: 6)\n- $2^5$ = 32 (units digit: 2)\n- $2^6$ = 64 (units digit: 4)\n- $2^7$ = 128 (units digit: 8)\n- $2^8$ = 256 (units digit: 6)\n- ...\n\nWe can see that the units digits of powers of 2 follow a repeating pattern: 2, 4, 8, 6.\n\nNow, we need to find the exponent of 2 in $F_{1000}$. The exponent is $2^{1000}$.\n\nTo find the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$, we need to find the remainder when the exponent is divided by 4, since the units digit of powers of 2 repeats every 4 powers.\n\n$2^{1000} \\mod 4 = 0$, because $2^{1000}$ is a multiple of 4.\n\nHowever, the pattern we observed earlier would not apply here because we are now dealing with a much larger number. \n\nWe know that we need to look at $2^{4n}$ for the last digit to be 6. Then for the pattern to continue, we need to look at the number of times 4 divides into $2^{1000}$.\n\nLet's look at $2^{1000}$ and find the remainder when divided by 4. \n\nSince $2^{1000}$ is an even number, it will be divisible by 2. Therefore, $2^{1000} \\mod 4 = 0$, as $2^2 \\mod 4 =0$. However, we need to look at a number which is $2^{4n}$ because the pattern of the last digit of powers of 2 will be 6.\n\nWe need to find the number of times 4 divides into $2^{1000}$.\n\nWe can write $2^{1000}$ as $(2^4)^{250}$.\n\nTherefore, the number of times 4 divides into $2^{1000}$ is 250.\n\nNow, we need to find the units digit of $(2^4)^{250}$.\n\nSince the units digit of $2^4$ is 6, the units digit of $(2^4)^{250}$ will be 6.\n\nFinally, we need to find the units digit of $F_{1000} = 2^{2^{1000}} + 1$.\n\nSince the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6, the units digit of $F_{1000}$ will be 7.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{7}$."
