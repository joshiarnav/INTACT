    "model_solution": "To express $0.\\overline{3}+0.\\overline{2}$ as a common fraction, let's start by converting the repeating decimals into fractions.\n\n1. For $0.\\overline{3}$, let $x = 0.\\overline{3}$. When we multiply $x$ by $10$, we get $10x = 3.\\overline{3}$.\n\n2. Subtracting $x$ from $10x$, we get $9x = 3$. \n\n3. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n4. Now, let's convert $0.\\overline{2}$ to a fraction. Let $y = 0.\\overline{2}$. When we multiply $y$ by $10$, we get $10y = 2.\\overline{2}$.\n\n5. Subtracting $y$ from $10y$, we get $9y = 2$.\n\n6. Solving for $y$, we get $y = \\frac{2}{9}$.\n\n7. Now that we have the fractions for both decimals, we can add them together: $\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9}$.\n\n8. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is $9$. So, we can rewrite $\\frac{1}{3}$ as $\\frac{3}{9}$.\n\n9. Now, we can add the fractions: $\\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$.\n\nTherefore, $0.\\overline{3}+0.\\overline{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$."
