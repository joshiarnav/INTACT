    "problem": "There is a committee composed of eight women and two men. When they meet, they sit in a row---the women in indistinguishable rocking chairs and the men on indistinguishable stools.  How many distinct ways are there for me to arrange the eight chairs and two stools for a meeting?",
    "solution": "Because the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from each other and the stools are indistinguishable from each other, we can think of first placing the two stools somewhere in the ten slots and then filling the rest with rocking chairs. The first stool has $10$ slots in which it can go, and the second has $9$. However, because they are indistinguishable from each other, we have overcounted the number of ways to place the stools by a factor of $2$, so we divide by $2$. Thus, there are $\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = \\boxed{45}$ distinct ways to arrange the ten chairs and stools for a meeting.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of distinct ways to arrange the chairs and stools, we can think of it as a combination problem. \n\nSince there are 8 women (indistinguishable rocking chairs) and 2 men (indistinguishable stools), we want to choose 2 out of 10 positions for the stools (or the chairs, it doesn't matter). The remaining 8 positions will be for the rocking chairs.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 10 is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k)  = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of positions (10), and k is the number of positions we want to choose for the stools (2).\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!)\n= 10! / (2! * 8!)\n= (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)\n= 45\n\nTherefore, there are 45 distinct ways to arrange the 8 indistinguishable rocking chairs and 2 indistinguishable stools for a meeting.\n\n$\\boxed{45}$"
