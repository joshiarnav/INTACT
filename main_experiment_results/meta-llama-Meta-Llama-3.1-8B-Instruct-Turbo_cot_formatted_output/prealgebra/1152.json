    "model_solution": "To find the cube of the square of the second smallest prime number, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the second smallest prime number. \nThe smallest prime number is 2, so the second smallest prime number is 3.\n\n2. Calculate the square of 3. \nThe square of 3 is $3^2 = 9$.\n\n3. Calculate the cube of 9. \nThe cube of 9 is $9^3 = 729$.\n\nTherefore, the cube of the square of the second smallest prime number is $\\boxed{729}$."
