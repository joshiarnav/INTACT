    "model_solution": "To find the percentage of x that is equal to 40% of 50% of x, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate 40% of 50% of x:\n\n1. 50% of x = 0.5x\n2. 40% of 0.5x = 0.4 * 0.5x = 0.2x\n\nNow, we want to find the percentage of x that is equal to 0.2x. Let's call this percentage 'p'. \n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\np% of x = 0.2x\n\nTo find the percentage, we'll divide both sides by x and multiply by 100:\n\n(p/100)x = 0.2x\n\nDivide both sides by x:\n\np/100 = 0.2\n\nMultiply both sides by 100:\n\np = 20\n\nSo, the percentage of x that is equal to 40% of 50% of x is 20%.\n\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{20}$"
