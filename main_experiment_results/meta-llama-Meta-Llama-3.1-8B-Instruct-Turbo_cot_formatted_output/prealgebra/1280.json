    "problem": "The number 74 can be factored as 2(37), so 74 is said to have two distinct prime factors. How many distinct prime factors does 210 have?",
    "solution": "We know that $210 = 10 \\cdot 21$. Breaking down these factors even further, we have that $10 = 2 \\cdot 5$ and $21 = 3 \\cdot 7$, so $210 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. Since these factors are all prime, $210$ has $\\boxed{4}$ distinct prime factors.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of distinct prime factors of 210, we need to factor 210 into its prime factors.\n\nFirst, let's break down 210 into simpler factors: \n210 = 10 * 21\n\nBreaking down these factors further:\n10 = 2 * 5\n21 = 3 * 7\n\nSo, 210 can be expressed as:\n210 = 2 * 5 * 3 * 7\n\nNow, we can see that the prime factors of 210 are 2, 5, 3, and 7. Since each of these is a distinct prime number, the number of distinct prime factors of 210 is 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{4}$."
