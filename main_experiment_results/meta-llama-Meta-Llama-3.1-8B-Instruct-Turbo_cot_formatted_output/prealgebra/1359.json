    "model_solution": "To find the least positive integer divisible by each of the first eight positive integers, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. \n\nLet's list the first eight positive integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\nWe know that LCM(a, b) = |ab| / gcd(a, b), where gcd is the greatest common divisor.\n\nFirst, let's factorize the numbers:\n- 2 = 2\n- 3 = 3\n- 4 = 2^2\n- 5 = 5\n- 6 = 2 * 3\n- 7 = 7\n- 8 = 2^3\n\nNow, let's find the LCM of these numbers. Since 1 is a unit, we can ignore it. \n\nWe need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in the factorization of any number:\n- 2 appears with the highest power of 3\n- 3 appears with the power of 1\n- 5 appears with the power of 1\n- 7 appears with the power of 1\n\nNow, we can calculate the LCM:\nLCM = 2^3 * 3 * 5 * 7\n     = 8 * 3 * 5 * 7\n     = 840\n\nSo, the least positive integer divisible by each of the first eight positive integers is $\\boxed{840}$."
