    "problem": "The average of the numbers 23 and $x$ is 27. What is the positive difference between 23 and $x$? (Recall that the average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2).",
    "solution": "To calculate the average of two numbers, we add them and divide the sum by $2$.  From the given information, we have the equation  \\[\\frac{23+x}{2}=27.\\]  Multiplying both sides by $2$ yields \\[23+x=54.\\]  Thus, $x=54-23=31$.  Finally, the positive difference between $31$ and $23$ is \\[31-23=\\boxed{8}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To find the positive difference between 23 and $x$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. The average of 23 and $x$ is 27. Recall that the average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2. So, we can write an equation:\n\n   (23 + x) / 2 = 27\n\n2. To solve for $x$, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n   23 + x = 27 * 2\n\n3. Simplify the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n   23 + x = 54\n\n4. Now, we need to isolate $x$ by subtracting 23 from both sides of the equation:\n\n   x = 54 - 23\n\n5. Evaluate the right-hand side of the equation to find the value of $x$:\n\n   x = 31\n\n6. Now that we have the value of $x$, we can find the positive difference between 23 and $x$ by subtracting the smaller number from the larger number:\n\n   Positive difference = x - 23\n                       = 31 - 23\n                       = 8\n\nSo, the positive difference between 23 and $x$ is $\\boxed{8}$."
