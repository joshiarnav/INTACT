    "problem": "How many integers between 1 and 200 are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7?",
    "solution": "Integers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 must be multiples of 15.  We can start by listing the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200: $$15,30,45,60,75,90,105,120,135,150,165,180,195$$ Checking only the even numbers, we can eliminate those that are multiples of 4, leaving us with: $$15,30,45,75,90,105,135,150,165,195$$ Finally, we need to eliminate any remaining multiples of 7.  The only multiples of 7 we need to be concerned with are those ending in 5 or 0.  The only number on the list that is a multiple of 7 is 105.  Our final list is: $$15,30,45,75,90,135,150,165,195$$ This leaves us with $\\boxed{9}$ integers.",

    "model_solution": "To find the integers between 1 and 200 that are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 3 and 5**: The LCM of 3 and 5 is 15, as 15 is the smallest number that both 3 and 5 can divide into evenly.\n\n2. **Find the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200**: \n   - To find the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200, we can divide 200 by 15 and round down to the nearest whole number.\n   - 200 / 15 = 13.333, so we have 13 multiples of 15 between 1 and 200.\n\n3. **Find the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200 that are also multiples of 4**:\n   - The LCM of 15 and 4 is 60, as 60 is the smallest number that both 15 and 4 can divide into evenly.\n   - 200 / 60 = 3.333, so we have 3 multiples of 60 between 1 and 200.\n\n4. **Find the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200 that are also multiples of 7**:\n   - The LCM of 15 and 7 is 105, as 105 is the smallest number that both 15 and 7 can divide into evenly.\n   - 200 / 105 = 1.904, so we have 1 multiple of 105 between 1 and 200.\n\n5. **Subtract the multiples of 60 and 105 from the multiples of 15**:\n   - We have 13 multiples of 15 between 1 and 200.\n   - Subtract 3 multiples of 60: 13 - 3 = 10.\n   - Subtract 1 multiple of 105: 10 - 1 = 9.\n\n6. **The final answer is 9**:\n   - Therefore, there are 9 integers between 1 and 200 that are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7.\n\n$\\boxed{9}$"
