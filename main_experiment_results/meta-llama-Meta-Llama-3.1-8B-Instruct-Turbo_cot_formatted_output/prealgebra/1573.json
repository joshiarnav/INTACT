    "problem": "A 12-slice pizza was made with only pepperoni and mushroom toppings, and every slice has at least one topping. Only six slices have pepperoni, and exactly ten slices have mushrooms. How many slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms?",
    "solution": "There are 12 total slices, and 6 of them have pepperoni and 10 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number of the slices that have both toppings, so there are $6-n$ with just pepperoni and $10-n$ with just mushrooms.  Since every slice has at least one topping, and there are 12 slices, we must have $(6-n) + (10-n) + n = 12$, which gives $n=\\boxed{4}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of slices that have both pepperoni and mushrooms, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n1. Let's denote:\n   - P: the set of slices with pepperoni\n   - M: the set of slices with mushrooms\n   - n(P): the number of slices in set P\n   - n(M): the number of slices in set M\n   - n(P \u2229 M): the number of slices in the intersection of sets P and M (slices with both toppings)\n\n2. Given information:\n   - n(P) = 6 (number of slices with pepperoni)\n   - n(M) = 10 (number of slices with mushrooms)\n   - Total number of slices = 12\n\n3. We know that every slice has at least one topping, so the total number of slices is the union of sets P and M.\n   - n(P \u222a M) = 12\n\n4. The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that:\n   - n(P \u222a M) = n(P) + n(M) - n(P \u2229 M)\n\n5. Substituting the values we know:\n   - 12 = 6 + 10 - n(P \u2229 M)\n   - 12 = 16 - n(P \u2229 M)\n   - n(P \u2229 M) = 16 - 12\n   - n(P \u2229 M) = 4\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{4}$ slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms."
