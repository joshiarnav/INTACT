    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the areas of the two squares $ABCD$ and $AEFG$, we need to find the areas of each square and then add them together.\n\nFirst, let's look at square $ABCD$. The side length of this square is the length of $AB$, which we can call $x$. The area of square $ABCD$ is then $x^2$.\n\nNext, let's look at square $AEFG$. The side length of this square is the length of $AE$, which we can call $y$. The area of square $AEFG$ is then $y^2$.\n\nSince angle $EAB$ is a right angle, we know that the two squares share a hypotenuse, which is the line segment $AE$. By the Pythagorean theorem, we know that $x^2 + y^2 = 81$, since the side length of the larger square is $BE=9$. We can then substitute $x^2 + y^2$ into our area equation: $x^2 + y^2 = 81 \\implies x^2 + y^2 = 81$. \n\nThis implies that the sum of the areas of the two squares is 81 square units.\n\nSo, the answer is: $\\boxed{81}$"
