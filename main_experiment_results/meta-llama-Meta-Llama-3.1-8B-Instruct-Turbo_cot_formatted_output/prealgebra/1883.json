    "problem": "In order to compute the area of a particular circle, Juan first measures the length of its diameter. The actual diameter is 20 cm, but Juan's measurement has an error of up to $20\\%$. What is the largest possible percent error, in percent, in Juan's computed area of the circle?",
    "solution": "Juan can measure the diameter as a length anywhere between $20 - 20\\cdot 0.2 = 16$ and $20 + 20\\cdot 0.2 = 24$  cm. The actual area of the circle is $\\pi (20/2)^2=100\\pi$ square cm, but Juan can compute the area anywhere in the range $\\pi (16/2)^2=64 \\pi$ square cm to $\\pi (24/2)^2=144 \\pi$ square cm. Using the lower bound of the range, Juan's error is $(100\\pi - 64\\pi)/(100\\pi)=36\\%$. Using the upper bound of the range, Juan's error is $(144\\pi - 100\\pi)/(100\\pi)=44\\%$. Thus, the largest possible percent error is $\\boxed{44}$ percent.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest possible percent error in Juan's computed area of the circle, we need to consider the maximum possible error in his measurement of the diameter.\n\nGiven diameter = 20 cm (actual)\nMaximum possible error in diameter measurement = 20% of 20 cm\n= 0.2 * 20 cm\n= 4 cm\n\nSo, the maximum possible diameter measured by Juan = 20 cm + 4 cm\n= 24 cm\n\nNow, let's calculate the area of the circle for both the actual and measured diameters.\n\nActual area = \u03c0 * (diameter/2)^2\n= \u03c0 * (20/2)^2\n= \u03c0 * 10^2\n= approximately 314.16 square centimeters\n\nMeasured area = \u03c0 * (measured diameter/2)^2\n= \u03c0 * (24/2)^2\n= \u03c0 * 12^2\n= approximately 452.39 square centimeters\n\nPercent error in measured area = ((measured area - actual area) / actual area) * 100\n= ((452.39 - 314.16) / 314.16) * 100\n= (138.23 / 314.16) * 100\n= approximately 43.98%\n\nTherefore, the largest possible percent error in Juan's computed area of the circle is approximately 44% (rounding off to the nearest whole number, as we're asked for a percent).\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{44}$"
