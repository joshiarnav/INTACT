    "file_name": "./MATH_subsample_uniform/prealgebra/1896.json",
    "model_solution": "To find the median salary, we first need to arrange the 59 salaries in order from lowest to highest. \n\n1. There are 37 Administrative Specialists with a salary of $\\$23{,}000$, which is the lowest salary.\n2. There are 6 Associate Directors with a salary of $\\$50{,}000$, which is higher than the Administrative Specialists.\n3. There are 10 Directors with a salary of $\\$75{,}000$, which is higher than the Associate Directors.\n4. There are 5 Vice-Presidents with a salary of $\\$90{,}000$, which is higher than the Directors.\n5. There is 1 President with a salary of $\\$130{,}000$, which is the highest salary.\n\nSo, the ordered list of salaries is:\n37 x $\\$23{,}000$ \n6 x $\\$50{,}000$ \n10 x $\\$75{,}000$ \n5 x $\\$90{,}000$ \n1 x $\\$130{,}000$\n\nTo find the median, we need to find the middle value in the ordered list. Since there are 59 salaries (an odd number), the middle value is the 30th value.\n\nThe first 29 values are the 37 Administrative Specialists, which have a salary of $\\$23{,}000$. The 30th value is the 30th employee, who is an Administrative Specialist and has a salary of $\\$23{,}000$.\n\nTherefore, the median value of the 59 salaries is $\\boxed{\\$23{,}000}$."
