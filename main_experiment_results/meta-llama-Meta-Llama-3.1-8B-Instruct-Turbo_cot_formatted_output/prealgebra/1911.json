    "model_solution": "To find the number of equilateral triangles with all three vertices in the lattice, we need to consider the possible side lengths of these triangles and the lattice's symmetry.\n\n1. **Possible side lengths:** Since each point in the lattice is one unit from its nearest neighbor, the possible side lengths of the equilateral triangles are 1, $\\sqrt{3}$, and 2 units.\n\n2. **Counting triangles with side length 1:** \n   - There are 6 equilateral triangles with side length 1. These triangles can be formed by choosing any point and its two nearest neighbors.\n\n   ```Python\n# Define variables\nnum_triangles_side_length_1 = 6\n```\n\n3. **Counting triangles with side length \u221a3:**\n   - There are 2 equilateral triangles with side length $\\sqrt{3}.$ These triangles can be formed by choosing a point and its two adjacent points.\n\n   ```Python\n# Define variables\nnum_triangles_side_length_sqrt3 = 2\n```\n\n4. **Counting triangles with side length 2:**\n   - There is 1 equilateral triangle with side length 2. This triangle can be formed by choosing a point and its two nearest points on the opposite side of the lattice.\n\n   ```Python\n# Define variables\nnum_triangles_side_length_2 = 1\n```\n\n5. **Summing the results:** The total number of equilateral triangles with all three vertices in the lattice is the sum of the number of triangles for each side length.\n\n   ```Python\n# Calculate the total number of triangles\ntotal_num_triangles = num_triangles_side_length_1 + num_triangles_side_length_sqrt3 + num_triangles_side_length_2\n```\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{9}$."
