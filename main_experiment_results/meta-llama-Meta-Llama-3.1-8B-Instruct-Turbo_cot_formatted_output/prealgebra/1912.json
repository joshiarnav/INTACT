    "solution": "Since the arithmetic mean of these expressions is 24, we can write the expression for the mean: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{(x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)}{5}&=24\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad (x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)&=5\\cdot 24\n\\end{align*}\n\nCombining like terms on the left, we find $5x+40=120$, so $5x=80$, from which we have $x=16$. Our final answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $x$, we first need to find the arithmetic mean of the given expressions. The arithmetic mean is the sum of all expressions divided by the number of expressions.\n\nThe arithmetic mean of the expressions is given as 24. Since there are 5 expressions, we can set up the following equation:\n\n$\\frac{(x + 8) + 15 + 2x + 13 + (2x + 4)}{5} = 24$\n\nNow, we can combine like terms to simplify the equation:\n\n$\\frac{5x + 40}{5} = 24$\n\nNext, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n$5x + 40 = 120$\n\nNow, we can subtract 40 from both sides:\n\n$5x = 80$\n\nFinally, we can divide both sides by 5 to solve for $x$:\n\n$x = \\frac{80}{5}$\n\n$x = 16$\n\nSo, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{16}$."
