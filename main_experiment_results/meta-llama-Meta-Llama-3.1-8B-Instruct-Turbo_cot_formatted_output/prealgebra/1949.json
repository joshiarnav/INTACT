    "problem": "What is the smallest positive number that is prime and $10$ less than a perfect square?",
    "solution": "A number 10 less than an even perfect square cannot be prime, so let's check odd perfect squares greater than 10:\n\n$\\bullet$ $5^2=25,$ $25-10=15,$ composite.\n\n$\\bullet$ $7^2=49,$ $49-10=39,$ composite.\n\n$\\bullet$ $9^2=81,$ $81-10=71.$\n\nChecking prime numbers up to $7$ $($the  largest prime less than $\\sqrt{71})$ as potential divisors, we  see that $71$ is prime. Thus, the smallest prime that is $10$ less  than a perfect square is $\\boxed{71}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest positive number that is prime and 10 less than a perfect square, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the smallest perfect squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, ...\n\n2. Subtract 10 from each perfect square to get a number that is 10 less than a perfect square: \n   - 1 - 10 = -9 (not positive, so we skip this)\n   - 4 - 10 = -6 (not positive, so we skip this)\n   - 9 - 10 = -1 (not positive, so we skip this)\n   - 16 - 10 = 6 (a positive number)\n   - 25 - 10 = 15 (not prime, so we skip this)\n   - 36 - 10 = 26 (not prime, so we skip this)\n   - 49 - 10 = 50 - 10 = 39 - 10 = 39 is not prime but 39-10 is not what we're looking for, so we skip it\n   - 64 - 10 = 54 (not prime, so we skip this)\n   - 81 - 10 = 71 (a prime number)\n\nWe found that 71 is a prime number and 10 less than a perfect square (81).\n\nSo, the smallest positive number that is prime and 10 less than a perfect square is $\\boxed{71}$."
