    "problem": "If only one quarter of the earth's surface is not covered by bodies of water, and only one half of that exposed land area is inhabitable for humans (because of poles, deserts, etc.), what fraction of the earth's surface can humans live on?",
    "solution": "One half of one quarter of the earth is $\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{4}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on, we'll break it down step by step.\n\n1. Only one quarter of the earth's surface is not covered by bodies of water. This can be represented as $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n2. Now, we need to consider that only half of the exposed land area is inhabitable for humans. Since this is half of the $\\frac{1}{4}$, we need to multiply $\\frac{1}{4}$ by $\\frac{1}{2}$ to get the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on.\n\nSo, we multiply $\\frac{1}{4}$ by $\\frac{1}{2}$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$."
