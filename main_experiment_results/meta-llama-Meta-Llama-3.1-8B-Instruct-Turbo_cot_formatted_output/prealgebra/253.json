    "problem": "If $x^2 = y - 3$ and $x = -5$, then what is the value of $y$?",
    "solution": "Substituting $-5$ for $x$ in the first equation, we have $(-5)^2 = y-3$.  So $25=y-3$. Adding $3$ to both sides, $y=\\boxed{28}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve for $y$, we need to substitute the value of $x$ into the equation $x^2 = y - 3$. Given that $x = -5$, we can substitute this value into the equation.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of $x^2$. \n\n$x^2 = (-5)^2 = 25$\n\nNow, we can substitute this value into the equation $x^2 = y - 3$.\n\n$25 = y - 3$\n\nTo solve for $y$, we need to isolate the variable $y$. We can do this by adding $3$ to both sides of the equation.\n\n$y = 25 + 3$\n$y = 28$\n\nTherefore, the value of $y$ is $\\boxed{28}$."
