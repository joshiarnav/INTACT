    "problem": "A toy store manager received a large order of Mr. Slinkums just in time for the holidays. The manager places $20\\%$ of them on the shelves, leaving the other 120 Mr. Slinkums in storage. How many Mr. Slinkums were in this order?",
    "solution": "If $20\\%$ of the toys were put on the shelves, the $80\\%$ of the toys were left in storage.  Therefore, we are given $80\\% T=120$, where $T$ is the number of toys in the order.  Rewriting $80\\%$ as $\\frac{4}{5}$ and multiplying both sides by $\\frac{5}{4}$, we find that $T=120\\cdot\\frac{5}{4}=30\\cdot 5=\\boxed{150}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's denote the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order as $x$. Since 20% of them are placed on the shelves, it means that 80% of them are left in storage. We are given that 120 Mr. Slinkums are left in storage, which is 80% of the total.\n\nWe can set up the following equation:\n\n80% of x = 120\n0.8x = 120\n\nTo solve for x, we need to divide both sides by 0.8:\n\nx = 120 / 0.8\nx = 150\n\nSo, there were 150 Mr. Slinkums in this order.\n\n$\\boxed{150}$"
