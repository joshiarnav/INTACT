    "problem": "What is the greatest common factor of 68 and 92?",
    "solution": "$68=2^2\\cdot17$ and $92=2^2\\cdot23$. The only prime number that these two prime factorizations have in common is the number 2. If a number's prime factorization has a 2 raised to a power greater than 2, it will not be a factor of either of these numbers, so their GCF is $2^2=\\boxed{4}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 68 and 92, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. List the factors of each number:\n   Factors of 68: 1, 2, 4, 17, 34, 68\n   Factors of 92: 1, 2, 4, 23, 46, 92\n\n2. Identify the common factors:\n   The common factors of 68 and 92 are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n3. Determine the greatest common factor:\n   The greatest common factor of 68 and 92 is the largest number among the common factors, which is 4.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common factor of 68 and 92 is $\\boxed{4}$."
