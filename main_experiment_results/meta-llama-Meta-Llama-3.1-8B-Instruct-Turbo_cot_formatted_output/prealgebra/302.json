    "problem": "What is $ 6 \\div 3 - 2 - 8 + 2 \\cdot 8$?",
    "solution": "Recall that multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction. We get \\[\n6 \\div 3 - 2 - 8 + 2 \\cdot 8 = 2 - 2 - 8 + 16.\n\\]We rewrite the subtractions as additions of negations so we can rearrange:  \\begin{align*}\n2 - 2 - 8 + 16 &= 2 + (-2) + (-8) + 16 \\\\\n&= 16 + 2 + (-2) + (-8) \\\\\n&= 18 - (2+8) \\\\\n&= 18-10 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{8}.\n\\end{align*}",

Multiplication and Division (from left to right): \n   - $6 \\div 3 = 2$\n   - $2 \\cdot 8 = 16$\n\nSo, the expression becomes $2 - 2 - 8 + 16$.\n\n4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):\n   - $2 - 2 = 0$\n   - $0 - 8 = -8$\n   - $-8 + 16 = 8$\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{8}$."
