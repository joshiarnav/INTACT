    "problem": "What is the 20th digit after the decimal point of the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$?",
    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$, and that of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $0.\\overline{3}$. The first has a repeating block of 6 digits and the second has a repeating block of 1 digit, so we believe the repeating block of the sum will have 6 digits and try adding the first 6 digits of each decimal representation.  $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}& & &. &1 & 4 & \\stackrel{1}{2} & 8 & \\stackrel{1}{5} & 7\\\\& +& &. &3 &3 & 3 & 3& 3 & 3\\\\ \\cline{1-9} & & & .& 4 &7 & 6 & 1 & 9 & 0\\\\ \\end{array} $$ Notice that continuing the addition past the first six digits will result in repeating blocks of the same six digits ($.142857+.333333=.476190$), so the decimal representation of the sum is $0.\\overline{476190}$. Since 20 divided by 6 has a remainder of 2, the 20th digit following the decimal point is the same as the second digit following the decimal point, which is $\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the 20th digit after the decimal point of the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, we first need to find the decimal equivalents.\n\nThe decimal equivalent of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$, which is a repeating decimal with a six-digit repeating block.\n\nThe decimal equivalent of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $0.\\overline{3}$, which is a repeating decimal with a single-digit repeating block.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of these two decimals.\n\nWhen adding repeating decimals, we can align the repeating blocks and add the non-repeating parts separately.\n\nTo add $0.\\overline{142857}$ and $0.\\overline{3}$, we can rewrite the decimals as follows:\n\n$\\frac{1}{7} = 0.\\overline{142857}$ and $\\frac{1}{3} = 0.\\overline{3} = 0.\\overline{333333}$ (to align with the repeating block of 1/7)\n\nNow, we add the decimals:\n\n$0.\\overline{142857} + 0.\\overline{333333} = 0.\\overline{476190}$ (combining the repeating blocks)\n\nSince 1/3 is a repeating decimal with only one digit, we can't get a 20th digit from just 1/3 by itself but we can get it from 1/7.\n\nThe repeating block of 1/7 is $142857$. \n\nTo find the 20th digit after the decimal point, we can divide 20 by the length of the repeating block, which is 6, to find the position of the digit within the block.\n\n$20 \\div 6 = 3$ with a remainder of 2, which means the 20th digit is the 2nd digit of the 4th repeating block.\n\nThe 2nd digit of the 4th repeating block is 8.\n\nTherefore, the 20th digit after the decimal point of the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ is 8.\n\n$\\boxed{8}$"
