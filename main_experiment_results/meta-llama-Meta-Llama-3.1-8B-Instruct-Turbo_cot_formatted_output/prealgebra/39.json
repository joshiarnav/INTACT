    "problem": "In pentagon $MATHS$, $\\angle M \\cong \\angle T \\cong \\angle H$ and $\\angle A$ is supplementary to $\\angle S$. How many degrees are in the measure of $\\angle H$?",
    "solution": "The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so we must have \\[\\angle M + \\angle A + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle S = 540^\\circ.\\] Since $\\angle A$ and $\\angle S$ are supplementary, we have $\\angle A +\\angle S = 180^\\circ$.  Combining this with $\\angle H = \\angle M = \\angle T$, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\angle M + \\angle A + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle S& =\n(\\angle M + \\angle T + \\angle H) \\\\\n&\\qquad+ (\\angle A +\\angle S) \\\\\n&= 3\\angle H + 180^\\circ,\\end{align*} so $3\\angle H + 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ$.  Therefore, $3\\angle H = 360^\\circ$ and $\\angle H = \\boxed{120^\\circ}$.",

Then, the sum of the measures of all five angles in the pentagon MATHS must be 540\u00b0, since the sum of the interior angles of any pentagon is 540\u00b0.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\nx + x + x + 180 = 540\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x + 180 = 540\n\nSubtract 180 from both sides:\n\n3x = 360\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 120\n\nSo, the measure of \u2220H is 120\u00b0.\n\nThe answer is: \n\n\\boxed{120}"
