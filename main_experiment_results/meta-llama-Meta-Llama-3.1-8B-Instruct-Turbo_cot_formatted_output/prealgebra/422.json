    "solution": "A circle's radius is half its diameter, so if the diameter of a circle is 4 meters, then its radius is 2 meters.  The area of the circle is $\\pi(\\text{radius})^2=\\pi(2\\text{ m})^2=\\boxed{4\\pi}$ square meters.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of a circle, we use the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where $A$ is the area and $r$ is the radius of the circle.\n\nGiven the diameter of the circle is 4 meters, we need to find the radius. The radius is half of the diameter, so:\n\n$radius = \\frac{diameter}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$ meters\n\nNow, we can plug the value of the radius into the formula for the area:\n\n$A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (2)^2 = \\pi \\times 4$\n\nSo, the area of the circle with a diameter of 4 meters is $\\boxed{4\\pi}$ square meters."
