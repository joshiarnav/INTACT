    "problem": "A teacher has a class with $24$ students in it. If she wants to split the students into equal groups of at most $10$ students each, what is the least number of groups that she needs?",
    "solution": "For the teacher to be able to split her students into $x$ groups of $y$ students each, $y$ must be a divisor of $24$. Since we want to create as few groups as possible, we need to maximize the number of students in each group. Thus, $y$ should be the greatest divisor of $24$ that is less than or equal to $10$. This means that $y=8$ and $x=3$. The teacher can create $\\boxed{3}$ groups of $8$ students each.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least number of groups, we need to divide the total number of students (24) by the maximum number of students allowed per group (10). \n\n1. Divide 24 by 10: 24 / 10 = 2.4\n\nSince the teacher cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This is because the groups must be equal, and having a fraction of a group would mean some groups have more students than others.\n\n2. Round up 2.4 to the nearest whole number: 3\n\nHowever, this would exceed the 10-student limit for the last group, making the previous groups have more than 10 students. Therefore, we must consider a different approach.\n\n3. Consider dividing the students into groups of 9, which is the largest multiple of 10 that is less than 24. \n\n- Divide 24 by 9: 24 / 9 = 2.67\n- Round up 2.67 to the nearest whole number: 3\n\nThis would result in 2 full groups of 9 students and 6 students in a third group (24 - 18 = 6). However, the problem states the groups must be \"at most\" 10 students. Thus, the original division by 10 is still the best approach.\n\n4. Reconsider the division with the correct rounding approach for the original division by 10: \n\n- Divide 24 by 10: 24 / 10 = 2.4\n- Round up 2.4 to the nearest whole number: 3\n\nTo ensure all groups have 10 students or less, we need to consider the remainder when 24 is divided by 10. The remainder is 4, indicating that we have 4 students left over.\n\n- Divide the remainder (4) by the maximum number of students allowed per group (1): 4 / 1 = 4\n\nSince the remainder is already a whole number, we do not need to round it up. This result is expected because the remainder represents the number of additional groups needed to accommodate the remaining students.\n\n5. To find the least number of groups, we add the quotient from the original division (2) to the remainder (4).\n\n- Total number of groups: 2 + 4 = 6\n\nTherefore, the least number of groups the teacher needs is $\\boxed{6}$."
