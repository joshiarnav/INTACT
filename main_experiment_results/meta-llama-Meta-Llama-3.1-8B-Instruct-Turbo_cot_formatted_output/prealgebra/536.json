    "problem": "A zoo has a menagerie containing four pairs of different animals, one male and one female for each. The zookeeper wishes to feed the animals in a specific pattern: each time he feeds a single animal, the next one he feeds must be a different gender. If he starts by feeding the male giraffe, how many ways can he feed all the animals?",
    "solution": "If the zookeeper starts with the male giraffe, there are 4 females which he can feed next. Once one is selected, there are 3 males he can feed next, then 3 females, 2 males, 2 females, 1 male, and 1 female.\n\nThe total number of possibilities is $4\\times3\\times3\\times2\\times2 = \\boxed{144}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\n1. The zookeeper starts by feeding the male giraffe. Now, he has 4 females to choose from.\n\n2. After feeding a female, he must feed a male. At this point, he has 3 males left (excluding the male giraffe he already fed).\n\n3. He feeds a female, and now he has 3 females left.\n\n4. He feeds a male, and now he has 2 males left.\n\n5. He feeds a female, and now he has 2 females left.\n\n6. He feeds a male, and now he has 1 male left.\n\n7. Finally, he feeds the last female.\n\nNow, let's count the number of ways to feed the animals.\n\n- The first female can be chosen in 4 ways.\n- The second male can be chosen in 3 ways.\n- The second female can be chosen in 3 ways.\n- The third male can be chosen in 2 ways.\n- The third female can be chosen in 2 ways.\n- The fourth male can be chosen in 1 way.\n- The last female can be chosen in 1 way.\n\nThe total number of ways to feed the animals is the product of the above choices:\n\n4 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 144\n\nSo, the zookeeper can feed all the animals in 144 different ways.\n\n$\\boxed{144}$"
