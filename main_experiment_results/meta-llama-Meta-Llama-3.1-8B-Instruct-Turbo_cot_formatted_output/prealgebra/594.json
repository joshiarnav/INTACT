    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the prime factors of 91, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to find the prime factors of 91. To do this, we can start by dividing 91 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. However, 91 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2.\n\n2. The next prime number is 3. Let's try dividing 91 by 3. \n\n   91 \u00f7 3 = 30.33\n\n   Since 91 is not divisible by 3, we move on to the next prime number.\n\n3. The next prime number is 5. Let's try dividing 91 by 5.\n\n   91 \u00f7 5 = 18.2\n\n   Since 91 is not divisible by 5, we move on to the next prime number.\n\n4. The next prime number is 7. Let's try dividing 91 by 7.\n\n   91 \u00f7 7 = 13\n\n   Since 91 is divisible by 7, we have found one of its prime factors.\n\n5. Now, we have 91 = 7 * 13. Both 7 and 13 are prime numbers.\n\n6. To find the sum of the prime factors of 91, we add 7 and 13.\n\n   7 + 13 = 20\n\n   Therefore, the sum of the prime factors of 91 is 20.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{20}$."
