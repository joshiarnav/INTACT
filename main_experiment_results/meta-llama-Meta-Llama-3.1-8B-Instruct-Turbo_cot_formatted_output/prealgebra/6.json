    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\n1. **Count the smallest triangles:** We start by counting the smallest triangles, which are the equilateral triangles formed by the lines in the figure. There are $11$ of these small triangles.\n\n2. **Count the larger triangles:** Next, we count the larger triangles formed by combining smaller triangles. There are $4$ triangles that consist of $4$ small triangles each.\n\n3. **Count the largest triangle:** Then, there is $1$ large triangle that consists of $9$ small triangles.\n\n4. **Check for any other triangles:** There are no other larger triangles formed by combining smaller triangles in the figure.\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of triangles:** Now, we add up the number of small triangles, the larger triangles, and the largest triangle to get the total number of triangles: $11 + 4 + 1 = \\boxed{16}.$"
