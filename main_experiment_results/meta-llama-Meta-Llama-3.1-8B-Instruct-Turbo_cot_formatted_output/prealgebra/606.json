    "problem": "An equilateral triangle has sides of length 2 units. A second equilateral triangle is formed having sides that are $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the first triangle. A third equilateral triangle is formed having sides that are $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the second triangle. The process is continued until four equilateral triangles exist. What will be the percent increase in the perimeter from the first triangle to the fourth triangle? Express your answer to the nearest tenth.",
    "solution": "If the side length of each successive equilateral triangle is $150\\%$ of the previous triangle, then we can multiply the previous side length by 1.5. We will need to do this three times to get to the fourth triangle, so its side length will be $$1.5^3 = 1.5 \\times 1.5 \\times 1.5 = 3.375$$ times the  original side length. This is the same as $337.5\\%$ of the original side length, which represents a $337.5 - 100 = 237.5\\%$ increase over the original side length. The perimeter is also a length, so it will be affected in the same way. The percent increase in the perimeter is $\\boxed{237.5\\%}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the percent increase in the perimeter of the triangles, we'll first calculate the perimeter of the first and fourth triangles, and then find the percent increase.\n\nThe perimeter of an equilateral triangle with side length s is 3s.\n\nThe first equilateral triangle has a side length of 2 units. So, its perimeter is:\n3 * 2 = 6 units\n\nNow, let's find the side length of the second equilateral triangle. It is 150% of the side length of the first triangle.\nThe second triangle's side length = 2 * 1.5 = 3 units\nThe second triangle's perimeter = 3 * 3 = 9 units\n\nNow, let's find the side length of the third equilateral triangle. It is 150% of the side length of the second triangle.\nThe third triangle's side length = 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 units\nThe third triangle's perimeter = 3 * 4.5 = 13.5 units\n\nNow, let's find the side length of the fourth equilateral triangle. It is 150% of the side length of the third triangle.\nThe fourth triangle's side length = 4.5 * 1.5 = 6.75 units\nThe fourth triangle's perimeter = 3 * 6.75 = 20.25 units\n\nNow, to find the percent increase in the perimeter from the first triangle to the fourth triangle, we'll use the formula:\n((Perimeter of fourth triangle - Perimeter of first triangle) / Perimeter of first triangle) * 100\n\n=((20.25 - 6) / 6) * 100\n=(14.25 / 6) * 100\n=2.375 * 100\n=237.5\n\nSo, the percent increase in the perimeter from the first triangle to the fourth triangle is 237.5%."
