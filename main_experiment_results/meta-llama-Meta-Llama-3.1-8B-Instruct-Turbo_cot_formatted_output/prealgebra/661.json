    "problem": "The figure shown represents a plot of land and is drawn using a scale in which 1 cm equals 2 miles. One square mile is 640 acres. How large is the actual plot of land, in acres?

    "solution": "First, let's calculate the area of the plot of land in cm. Then, we'll convert as the questions ask.\n\nRecall the formula for the area of a trapezoid is given by $\\mbox{Area} = (\\mbox{bottom} + \\mbox{ top})\\times \\mbox{height} \\times \\frac{1}{2}$, so the area of this trapezoid is $$(10 \\mbox{cm} + 15 \\mbox{cm}) \\times 10 \\mbox{cm} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 125 \\mbox{cm}^2.$$Now, we are given that $1 \\mbox{ cm } = 2 \\mbox{ miles }$. Squaring both sides, that means $$1 \\mbox{ cm}^2 = 4 \\mbox{ miles}^2.$$We are told that $1 \\mbox{ miles}^2 = 640 \\mbox{ acres}$, so the above equation is actually:\n\n$$1 \\mbox{ cm}^2 = 4 \\mbox{ miles}^2 \\times \\frac{ 640 \\mbox{ acres}}{1 \\mbox{ miles}^2} = 2560 \\mbox{ acres}.$$Finally, we can convert $$125 \\mbox{ cm}^2 \\times \\frac{ 2560 \\mbox{ acres}}{1 \\mbox{ cm}^2} = \\boxed{320000 \\mbox{ acres}}.$$",

    "model_solution": "To find the size of the actual plot of land in acres, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the dimensions of the plot of land from centimeters to miles using the given scale. The scale is 1 cm = 2 miles.\n\n- The length of the plot is 15 cm, so its length in miles is 15 * 2 = 30 miles.\n- The width of the plot (at the bottom) is 10 cm, so its width in miles is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.\n- The width of the plot (at the top) is 10 cm, so its width in miles is 10 * 2 = 20 miles.\n\n2. Calculate the area of the plot of land in square miles. \n\n- Since one side of the plot is a trapezoid (the top side), we need to calculate the area of the trapezoid. However, in this case, we can simply find the area of the rectangle formed by the bottom and the left side and add the area of the triangle on the right side.\n\n- The area of the rectangle is the product of the length and the width, which is 30 * 20 = 600 square miles.\n- The area of the triangle is half the product of its base and height, which is (1 * 10)/2 = 5 square miles.\n\n3. The total area of the plot of land is the area of the rectangle plus the area of the triangle, which is 600 + 5 = 605 square miles.\n\n4. Convert the area of the plot of land from square miles to acres.\n\n- Since 1 square mile is equal to 640 acres, the area of the plot of land in acres is 605 * 640 = 387200 acres.\n\nSo the actual plot of land is $\\boxed{387200}$ acres."
