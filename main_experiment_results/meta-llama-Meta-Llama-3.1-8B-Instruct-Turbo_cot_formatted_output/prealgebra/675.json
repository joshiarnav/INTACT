    "problem": "The average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $4x-7$. What is $x$?",
    "solution": "The average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $\\dfrac{1}{3}((x+6)+(6x+2)+(2x+7))$. Simplifying this expression gives $\\dfrac{1}{3}(9x+15)=3x+5$. We know the average is also $4x-7$, so $3x+5=4x-7$. Subtracting $3x-7$ from both sides of this equation gives $x=\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of x, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. The average of three numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 3. So, we can write the given information as:\n\n   ((x+6) + (6x+2) + (2x+7)) / 3 = 4x - 7\n\n2. Now, let's simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining like terms:\n\n   ((x+6x+2x) + (6+2+7)) / 3 = 4x - 7\n\n   (9x + 15) / 3 = 4x - 7\n\n3. Next, let's simplify the left-hand side by dividing the numerator by 3:\n\n   9x + 15 = 3(4x - 7)\n\n   9x + 15 = 12x - 21\n\n4. Now, let's isolate x by moving all terms with x to one side of the equation:\n\n   9x - 12x = -21 - 15\n\n   -3x = -36\n\n5. Finally, let's solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by -3:\n\n   x = -36 / -3\n\n   x = 12\n\nSo, the value of x is:\n\n$\\boxed{12}$"
