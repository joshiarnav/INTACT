    "problem": "If $\\frac{5}{33}$ is expressed in decimal form, what digit is in the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point?",
    "solution": "When we write $\\frac{5}{33}$ as a decimal using long division, we get $0.\\overline{15}=0.15151515\\ldots$. Notice the pattern we have here: if $n$ is odd, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal point is $1$; if $n$ is even, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal place is $5$. Since $92$ is an even number, the digit at the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point is $\\boxed{5}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the digit in the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point, we need to convert $\\frac{5emory}{33}$ to a decimal.\n\nFirst, let's perform long division. To divide 5 by 33, we can use an approximation. We know that $5 = 3 \\times 1 + 2$, and $33 = 10 \\times 3 + 3$. \n\nNow we need to do long division, and it is more efficient to do it mentally by using the above results. Divide 5 by 3 to get 1, and then divide 2 by 3, and we get 0 with a remainder of 2, but since we are dividing by 33, we need to multiply 1 by 33 and subtract 33 from 5, then divide 2 by 33. We get 0.1. Then we bring down a zero, multiply 2 by 10 and divide by 33, we get approximately 0.06. Now bring down another zero, multiply 26 by 10 and divide by 33. Multiply 26 by 10 to get 260, and divide 260 by 33, we get approximately 7.9.\n\nMultiply 79 by 33, and we get 2607. Subtract 2607 from 2599. We have 8 left. Multiply 8 by 10, we get 80. Divide 80 by 33, we get approximately 2.42. Multiply 24 by 33, we get 792. Subtract 792 from 793, we have 1 left. Multiply 1 by 10, we get 10. Divide 10 by 33, we get approximately 0.3.\n\nNow we multiply 3 by 33, we get 99. Subtract 99 from 80, we have 19 left. Multiply 19 by 10, we get 190. Divide 190 by 33, we get approximately 5.75. Multiply 57 by 33, we get 1881. Subtract 1881 from 190, we have 109 left. Multiply 109 by 10, we get 1090. Divide 1090 by 33, we get approximately 33.03. Multiply 330 by 33, we get 10890. Subtract 10890 from 1090, we have 200 left. Multiply 200 by 10, we get 2000. Divide 2000 by 33, we get approximately 60.6.\n\nNow we multiply 606 by 33, we get 19998. Subtract 19998 from 2000, we have 2 left. Multiply 2 by 10, we get 20. Divide 20 by 33, we get approximately 0.61. Multiply 61 by 33, we get 2013. Subtract 2013 from 20, we have -1993 left. Multiply -1993 by 10, we get -19930. Divide -19930 by 33, we get approximately -604.55. Multiply -604 by 33, we get -19932. Subtract 19932 from -19930, we have 2 left.\n\nMultiply 2 by 10, we get 20. Divide 20 by 33, we get approximately 0.61. Multiply 61 by 33, we get 2013. Subtract 2013 from 20, we have -1993 left. Multiply -1993 by 10, we get -19930. Divide -19930 by 33, we get approximately -604.55. Multiply -604 by 33, we get -19932. Subtract 19932 from -19930, we have 2 left.\n\nIt seems like we have a repeating decimal, 0.151515...., where 15 is the repeating digit. Since we have 92 in the place, 92 is even, and the repeating part of the decimal is 15, which has two digits, so in the 92nd place to the right of the decimal, the digit is $\\boxed{5}$."
