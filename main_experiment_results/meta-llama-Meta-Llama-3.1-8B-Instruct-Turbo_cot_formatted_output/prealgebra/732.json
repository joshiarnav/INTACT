    "problem": "Amanda, Ben, and Carlos share a sum of money. Their portions are in the ratio of 1:2:7, respectively. If Amanda's portion is $\\$$20, what is the total amount of money shared?",
    "solution": "We multiply each part of the ratio $1:2:7$ by 20 to make Amanda's part equal 20, and we have \\[1:2:7 = 1\\cdot 20:2\\cdot 20 :7\\cdot 20 = 20:40:140.\\] This means that  Ben's share is $2\\times 20 = 40$ dollars and Carlos's share is $7\\times 20=140$ dollars.  Therefore, the total amount of money shared is $20+40+140=\\boxed{200}$ dollars.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total amount of money shared, we first need to determine the parts of the ratio.\n\nGiven that the portions are in the ratio of 1:2:7 for Amanda, Ben, and Carlos respectively, we can write this as:\n1x + 2x + 7x = total amount\n\nWe also know that Amanda's portion is $\\$$20, which corresponds to the first part of the ratio (1x). Since the ratio is 1:2:7, we can write this as:\n1x = 20\n\nTo find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 1:\nx = 20 / 1\nx = 20\n\nNow that we know the value of x, we can find the portions of Ben and Carlos by multiplying their respective parts of the ratio by x:\nBen's portion: 2x = 2 * 20 = 40\nCarlos's portion: 7x = 7 * 20 = 140\n\nThe total amount of money shared is the sum of Amanda's, Ben's, and Carlos's portions:\nTotal amount = 20 + 40 + 140\nTotal amount = 200\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money shared is $\\boxed{200}$."
