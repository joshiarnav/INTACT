    "problem": "How many diagonals does a convex polygon with 23 sides have?",
    "solution": "If the polygon has 23 sides, then it has 23 vertices. A diagonal is created by choosing 2 non-adjacent vertices and connecting them. First we choose a vertex. There are 23 choices. Then we choose another vertex that is not adjacent to the one we already chose. There are 20 choices for this. However, we have double counted all the diagonals, so the number of diagonals is $\\frac{23 \\cdot 20}{2}=23 \\cdot 10=\\boxed{230} \\text{ diagonals}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of diagonals in a convex polygon with 23 sides, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of diagonals = n(n-3)/2\n\nwhere n is the number of sides.\n\nFirst, let's plug in the value of n:\nn = 23\n\nNow, substitute the value of n into the formula:\nNumber of diagonals = 23(23-3)/2\n\nTo calculate the value inside the parentheses first:\n23-3 = 20\n\nNow, multiply 23 by 20:\n23 * 20 = 460\n\nFinally, divide the product by 2:\n460/2 = 230\n\nSo, the number of diagonals in a convex polygon with 23 sides is:\n$\\boxed{230}$"
