    "problem": "A square 10cm on each side has four quarter circles drawn with centers at the four corners. How many square centimeters are in the area of the shaded region? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize (1.5 cm);\n\ndraw((-1,-1)--(1,-1)--(1,1)--(-1,1)--cycle);\nfilldraw(arc((1,1),1,270,180)--arc((-1,1),1,360,270)--arc((-1,-1),1,90,0)--arc((1,-1),1,180,90)--cycle,gray);\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "We first notice that the area of the shaded region is the area of the square minus the areas of the four quarter circles. Each quarter circle has a radius half the side length, so if we sum the areas of the four quarter circles, we have the area of one full circle with radius $5$ cm. Now, we know the area of a square is the square of its side length, so the square has an area of $100 \\text{ cm}^2$. A circle has an area of $\\pi$ times its radius squared, so the four quarter circles combined have an area of $\\pi(5)^2=25\\pi \\text{ cm}^2$. From this, we know that the area of the shaded region is $\\boxed{100-25\\pi} \\text{ cm}^2$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the shaded region, we need to find the area of the square and subtract the areas of the four quarter circles.\n\nThe area of the square is given by the formula $side \\times side$. In this case, the side length is 10 cm, so the area of the square is:\n\nArea of square = $10 \\times 10$\n$= 100$ square centimeters.\n\nNow, let's find the area of each quarter circle. The formula for the area of a quarter circle is $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius is half the side length of the square, which is $\\frac{10}{2} = 5$ cm. So, the area of each quarter circle is:\n\nArea of quarter circle = $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi (5)^2$\n$= \\frac{1}{4}\\pi \\times 25$\n$= \\frac{25}{4}\\pi$ square centimeters.\n\nSince there are four quarter circles, we multiply the area of one quarter circle by 4 to get the total area of the quarter circles:\n\nTotal area of quarter circles = $4 \\times \\frac{25}{4}\\pi$\n$= 25\\pi$ square centimeters.\n\nNow, we subtract the total area of the quarter circles from the area of the square to get the area of the shaded region:\n\nArea of shaded region = Area of square - Total area of quarter circles\n$= 100 - 25\\pi$\n$= \\boxed{100 - 25\\pi}$ square centimeters."
