    "problem": "Only nine out of the original thirteen colonies had to ratify the U.S. Constitution in order for it to take effect. What is this ratio, nine to thirteen, rounded to the nearest tenth?",
    "solution": "Note that $\\frac{7.8}{13} = 0.6$ and $\\frac{9.1}{13} = 0.7.$ Since $\\frac{9}{13}$ is closer to $\\frac{9.1}{13}$ than to $\\frac{7.8}{13},$ $\\frac{9}{13}$ rounds to $\\boxed{0.7}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the ratio of nine to thirteen rounded to the nearest tenth, we first need to divide 9 by 13.\n\n9 \u00f7 13 = 0.6923076923\n\nNow, we round 0.6923076923 to the nearest tenth. To do this, we look at the hundredths place, which is 9 in this case. Since 9 is greater than 5, we round up the tenths place.\n\n0.6923076923 rounded to the nearest tenth is 0.7.\n\nSo, the ratio rounded to the nearest tenth is $\\boxed{0.7}$."
