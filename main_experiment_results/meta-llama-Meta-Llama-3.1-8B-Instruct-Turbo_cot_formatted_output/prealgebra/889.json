    "model_solution": "To find the area of $\\Delta ABC$, we need to first find the lengths of its sides. Since we are given the altitude $CD$, let's start by analyzing $\\triangle ACD$. \n\nIn $\\triangle ACD$, we have a $30-60-90$ triangle because angle $CAD$ is $30^{\\circ}$. In a $30-60-90$ triangle, the sides are in the ratio $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$. Since $CD = \\sqrt{3}$, we can conclude that $AC = 2CD = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nNow, let's look at $\\triangle ABC$. We have the length of $AC$, and we need to find the length of $BC$. Since we have a $30-60-90$ triangle, the ratio of the sides is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$. So, if $AC = 2\\sqrt{3}$, then $BC = 2$.\n\nNow that we have the lengths of $AC$ and $BC$, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. In this case, the base is $BC$ and the height is $AC$. So, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2\\sqrt{3} = 2\\sqrt{3}$\n\nTherefore, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $2\\sqrt{3}$ square centimeters. \n\n$\\boxed{2\\sqrt{3}}$"
