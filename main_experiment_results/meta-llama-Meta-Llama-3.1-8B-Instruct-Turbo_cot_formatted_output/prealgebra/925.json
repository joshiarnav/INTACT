    "problem": "A number in the set $\\{50, 51, 52, 53, ... , 999\\}$ is randomly selected. What is the probability that it is a two-digit number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "To count the number of numbers in this set, we subtract 49 from all of the numbers, giving the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 950 \\}$, making it obvious that there are 950 numbers total. Furthermore, the set $\\{ 50, 51, 52, \\ldots, 98, 99 \\}$ corresponds to the more easily counted $\\{ 1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 49, 50 \\}$ by subtracting 49. So, the probability of selecting a two-digit number is $\\frac{50}{950} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the randomly selected number is a two-digit number, we need to first find the total number of two-digit numbers in the given set and then divide it by the total number of numbers in the set.\n\nThe set starts from 50 and ends at 999. So, the two-digit numbers in the set range from 50 to 99.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of two-digit numbers in the set. Since the two-digit numbers range from 50 to 99, the total count can be found by subtracting the starting number from the ending number and adding 1.\n\nHowever, since we're dealing with a range where both the start and end are inclusive, we should consider the count as (ending number - starting number) + 1.\n\nTherefore, the total count of two-digit numbers is (99 - 50) + 1 = 50.\n\nNext, let's find the total number of numbers in the set. The set ranges from 50 to 999, so the total count can be found by subtracting the starting number from the ending number and adding 1.\n\nTherefore, the total count of numbers in the set is (999 - 50) + 1 = 950.\n\nNow, let's find the probability that the randomly selected number is a two-digit number. The probability can be found by dividing the total count of two-digit numbers by the total count of numbers in the set.\n\nSo, the probability = (total count of two-digit numbers) / (total count of numbers in the set) = 50 / 950.\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50.\n\nSo, the simplified probability = (50 / 50) / (950 / 50) = 1 / 19.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the randomly selected number is a two-digit number is 1 / 19.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$."
