    "problem": "A certain regular tetrahedron has three of its vertices at the points $(0,1,2),$ $(4,2,1),$ and $(3,1,5).$  Find the coordinates of the fourth vertex, given that they are also all integers.",
    "solution": "The side length of the regular tetrahedron is the distance between $(0,1,2)$ and $(4,2,1),$ which is\n\\[\\sqrt{(0 - 4)^2 + (1 - 2)^2 + (2 - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{18} = 3 \\sqrt{2}.\\]So if $(x,y,z)$ is the fourth vertex, with integer coordinates, then\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 2)^2 &= 18, \\\\\n(x - 4)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + (z - 1)^2 &= 18, \\\\\n(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 5)^2 &= 18.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting the first and third equations, we get $6x + 6z - 30 = 0$, so $x + z = 5,$ which means $z = 5 - x.$  Subtracting the first and second equation, we get $8x + 2y - 2z - 16 = 0,$ so\n\\[y = z - 4x + 8 = (5 - x) - 4x + 8 = 13 - 5x.\\]Substituting into the first equation, we get\n\\[x^2 + (12 - 5x)^2 + (3 - x)^2 = 18.\\]This simplifies to $27x^2 - 126x + 135 = 0,$ which factors as $9(x - 3)(3x - 5) = 0.$  Since $x$ is an integer, $x = 3.$  Then $y = -2$ and $z = 2.$  Thus, the fourth vertex is $\\boxed{(3,-2,2)}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the regular tetrahedron, we first need to find the length of the edges of the tetrahedron. This is because a regular tetrahedron has all edges of the same length.\n\nThe distance between two points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ in 3D space is given by the formula:\n\n$$d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}$$\n\nLet's find the distance between the points $(0,1,2)$ and $(4,2,1)$:\n\n$$d_{12} = \\sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (2 - 1)^2 + (1 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{4^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 1 + 1} = \\sqrt{18}$$\n\nNow, let's find the distance between the points $(0,1,2)$ and $(3,1,5)$:\n\n$$d_{13} = \\sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (1 - 1)^2 + (5 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 0 + 9} = \\sqrt{18}$$\n\nAnd let's find the distance between the points $(4,2,1)$ and $(3,1,5)$:\n\n$$d_{23} = \\sqrt{(3 - 4)^2 + (1 - 2)^2 + (5 - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 1^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1 + 16} = \\sqrt{18}$$\n\nSince the distances between all pairs of points are equal, we can conclude that the distances between the fourth vertex and each of the other three vertices are also equal.\n\nLet the coordinates of the fourth vertex be $(x, y, z)$. Then, using the distance formula, we have:\n\n$$\\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(x - 4)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + (z - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{18}$$\n\nSquaring both sides of each equation, we get:\n\n$$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2y + 4 = x^2 - 8x + y^2 - 4y + z^2 - 2z + 20 = x^2 - 6x + y^2 - 2y + z^2 - 10z + 84 = 18$$\n\nSimplifying the equations, we get:\n\n$y^2 - 2y + 4 = -8x + 4y - 2z + 20 = -6x + 2y - 10z + 84 = 18$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n$y^2 - 2y - 8x + 4y - 2z + 16 = 0$\n\n$-8x + 4y - 2z + 18 = 0$\n\n$-6x + 2y - 10z + 66 = 0$\n\nWe can solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\n\n$y^2 + 2y - 8x + 2z - 16 = 0$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n$y^2 + 2y - 8x + 2z = 16$\n\nSubstituting this expression into the second equation, we get:\n\n$-8x + 4(y^2 + 2y - 8x + 2z) + 18 = 0$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$-8x + 4y^2 + 8y - 32x + 8z + 18 = 0$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n$4y^2 + 8y - 40x + 8z + 18 = 0$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$2y^2 + 4y - 20x + 4z + 9 = 0$\n\nSubstituting this expression into the third equation, we get:\n\n$-6x + 2(2y^2 + 4y - 20x + 4z + 9) - 10z + 66 = 0$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$-6x + 4y^2 + 8y - 40x + 8z + 18 - 10z + 66 = 0$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n$4y^2 + 8y - 46x - 2z + 84 = 0$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$2y^2 + 4y - 23x - z + 42 = 0$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n$2y^2 + 4y - 20x + 4z + 9 = 0$\n\n$2y^2 + 4y - 23x - z + 42 = 0$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\n$-3x - 5z + 33 = 0$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n$-3x - 5z = -33$\n\nDividing both sides by -3, we get:\n\n$x + \\frac{5}{3}z = 11$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n\n$3x + 5z = 33$\n\nNow we have a linear equation with two variables. However, we can express the third variable (y) in terms of the other two variables.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\n\n$2y^2 + 4y - 20x + 4z + 9 = 0$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n$2y^2 + 4y + 4z = 20x - 9$\n\nFactoring the left-hand side, we get:\n\n$2(y^2 + 2y + 2) = 20x - 9$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$y^2 + 2y + 2 = 10x - 4.5$\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides, we get:\n\n$y^2 + 2y = 10x - 6.5$\n\nSubstituting x + 5z/3 for 11, we get:\n\n$y^2 + 2y = 10(11 - 5z/3) - 6.5$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$y^2 + 2y = 110 - 50z/3 - 6.5$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n$y^2 + 2y + 50z/3 = 103.5$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n\n$3y^2 + 6y + 50z = 310.5$\n\nNow we have a system of three equations with three variables:\n\n$3x + 5z = 33$\n\n$3y^2 + 6y + 50z = 310.5$\n\nWe can solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\n\n$z = \\frac{33 - 3x}{5}$\n\nSubstituting this expression for z into the second equation, we get:\n\n$3y^2 + 6y + 50(\\frac{33 - 3x}{5}) = 310.5$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$3y^2 + 6y + 660 - 30x = 310.5$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n$3y^2 + 6y - 30x - 349.5 = 0$\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\n$y^2 + 2y - 10x - 116.5 = 0$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$2y^2 + 4y - 20x - 233 = 0$\n\nNow we have a quadratic equation in two variables. However, we can express one variable in terms of the other variable.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\n\n$z = \\frac{33 - 3x}{5}$\n\nSubstituting this expression for z into the equation 2y^2 + 4y - 20x - 233 = 0, we get:\n\n$2y^2 + 4y - 20x - 233 = 0$\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n$2y^2 + 4y - 20x = 233$\n\nSubstituting x + 5z/3 for 11, we get"
