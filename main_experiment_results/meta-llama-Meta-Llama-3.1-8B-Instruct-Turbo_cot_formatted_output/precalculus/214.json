    "model_solution": "To find the number of $x$-intercepts on the graph of $y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x}$ in the interval $(0.0001, 0.001)$, we need to find the values of $x$ for which $\\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0.$\n\nSince $\\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0$ when $\\frac{1}{x} = k \\pi$ where $k$ is a nonzero integer, we can rewrite this as $x = \\frac{1}{k \\pi}.$\n\nWe need to find the number of values of $k$ for which $\\frac{1}{k \\pi}$ falls within the interval $(0.0001, 0.001).$ \n\nWe can rewrite the interval as $(0.0001, 0.001) = (\\frac{1}{10000}, \\frac{1}{1000}).$\n\nNow, we need to solve the inequality $\\frac{1}{10000} < \\frac{1}{k \\pi} < \\frac{1}{1000}.$\n\nMultiplying the inequality by $k \\pi$ (note that $k \\pi > 0$ since $k$ is a nonzero integer), we get $\\frac{k \\pi}{10000} < 1 < \\frac{k \\pi}{1000}.$\n\nSince $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, we have $\\frac{k}{10000} < \\frac{1}{\\pi} < \\frac{k}{1000}.$\n\nSubstituting $\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\approx \\frac{1}{3.14159} \\approx 0.31831,$ we get $\\frac{k}{10000} < 0.31831 < \\frac{k}{1000}.$\n\nMultiplying the inequality by $1000,$ we get $\\frac{k}{10} < 318.31 < k.$\n\nMultiplying the inequality by $10,$ we get $k < 3183.1 < 10k.$\n\nDividing the inequality by $10,$ we get $\\frac{k}{10} < 318.31 < k.$\n\nMultiplying the inequality by $10,$ we get $k < 3183.1 < 10k.$\n\nNow, we can round $3183.1$ to the nearest integer. $3183.1$ is between $3183$ and $3184.$ Therefore, we can conclude that $k < 3184.$\n\nSince $k$ must be an integer, we have $k \\leq 3183.$\n\nWe know that $k > 3183$ when $k \\geq 3184.$ Thus, we need to find the number of integers between $3184$ and the largest integer less than $\\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.1.$ \n\nSince $\\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.1,$ the largest integer less than $\\frac{10000}{\\pi}$ is $3183.$ \n\nTherefore, the number of integers between $3184$ and $3183$ is $0.$ \n\nHowever, we need to find the number of integers between $3184$ and $0.$ \n\nThe largest integer less than $0$ is $-1,$ but since $3184 > -1,$ we need to find the number of integers between $3184$ and $-1.$ \n\nThere are no integers between $3184$ and $-1.$ \n\nHowever, we can count the number of integers between $-1$ and $3183.$ \n\nThere are $3183 - (-1) = 3184$ integers between $-1$ and $3183.$ \n\nSince there are no integers between $3184$ and $-1,$ the total number of integers between $3184$ and $-1$ is $0.$ \n\nHowever, we need to count the number of integers between $-1$ and $3183.$ \n\nThere are $3183 - (-1) = 3184$ integers between $-1$ and $3183.$ \n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3183}.$"
