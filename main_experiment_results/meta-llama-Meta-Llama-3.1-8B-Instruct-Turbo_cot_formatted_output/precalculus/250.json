Since $AB = BC = CD = DE = 4$ and $AE = 1,$ we can draw a line segment from point $A$ to point $E$ and see that the lengths of the line segments $AB, BC, CD,$ and $DE$ are equal to 4. This indicates that the line segments $AB, BC, CD,$ and $DE$ are all equal and form an isosceles quadrilateral.\n\n2. Let's denote the point of intersection of $AE$ with the circle as $F.$ We can draw radii from the center of the circle (point $O$) to points $A, B, E,$ and $F.$\n\n3. Since the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is isosceles, we know that the angles opposite to each other are equal. So, the angles $\\angle B$ and $\\angle D$ are equal.\n\n4. We can use the Law of Cosines on triangle $ACD$ to find the cosine of $\\angle ACE.$ \n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with side lengths $a, b,$ and $c,$ and the angle opposite side $c$ denoted by $\\theta,$ we have the following equation:\n\n$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos\\theta$\n\nIn our case, let's consider triangle $ACD.$ We have $AC = 5,$ $CD = 4,$ and $AD = 4.$ We can use these side lengths to find $\\cos \\angle ACE.$\n\nApplying the Law of Cosines, we get:\n\n$5^2 = 4^2 + 4^2 - 2(4)(4)\\cos\\theta$\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n$25 = 32 - 32\\cos\\theta$\n\n$-7 = -32\\cos\\theta$\n\n$\\cos \\theta = \\frac{7}{32}$\n\nThis is not the cosine of angle ACE but rather the cosine of angle D in triangle ACD.\n\n5. Since the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is isosceles, we know that the angles opposite to each other are equal. So, the angles $\\angle B$ and $\\angle D$ are equal. This implies that $\\cos \\angle B = \\cos \\angle D.$\n\n6. Let's denote $\\cos \\angle B = \\cos \\angle D = \\cos \\theta.$ Then, using the Law of Cosines on triangle $ABE,$ we can find an expression for $(1 - \\cos \\angle B)(1 - \\cos \\angle ACE).$\n\nApplying the Law of Cosines, we get:\n\n$5^2 = 4^2 + 1^2 -

\\cos \\angle B)(1 - \\cos \\angle ACE).$\n\nApplying the Law of Cosines, we get:\n\n$25 = 16 + 1 - 8\\cos\\theta$\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n$8 = -8\\cos\\theta$\n\n$\\cos \\theta = \\frac{-1}{1}$\n\nThis equation doesn't give a correct result.\n\nLet's try to solve it in another way.\n\nWe can draw a perpendicular line segment from point $E$ to line segment $AB.$ Let's denote the point of intersection of the perpendicular line segment with line segment $AB$ as $G.$ We can see that the line segment $EG$ is perpendicular to line segment $AB,$ and therefore $\\angle EGA$ is a right angle.\n\nUsing the fact that $\\triangle AEG$ is a right triangle, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $AG.$ The Pythagorean theorem states that for any right triangle with side lengths $a, b,$ and $c,$ we have the following equation:\n\n$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$\n\nIn our case, we have $AE = 1,$ $AG = x,$ and $EG = 4.$ We can use these side lengths to find the length of $AG.$\n\nApplying the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\n$x^2 = 1^2 + 4^2$\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n$x^2 = 1 + 16$\n\n$x^2 = 17$\n\n$x = \\sqrt{17}$\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is isosceles and the lengths of the line segments $AB, BC, CD,$ and $DE$ are equal to 4.\n\nWe can denote the point of intersection of line segment $AB$ with line segment $DE$ as $H.$ We can see that the line segments $AB$ and $DE$ are equal in length, and therefore the angles opposite to each other are equal.\n\nThis implies that the angles $\\angle B$ and $\\angle D$ are equal.\n\nWe can use the fact that $\\triangle ABH$ is a right triangle and apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $BH.$ We can also use the fact that the lengths of the line segments $AB$ and $DE$ are equal to 4.\n\nApplying the Pythagorean theorem, we get:\n\n$B^2 = A^2 + H^2$\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n$4^2 = (\\sqrt{17})^2 + H^2$\n\n$16 = 17 + H^2$\n\n$H^2 = -1$\n\nHowever, the length of line segment $H$ cannot be an imaginary number.\n\nLet's try to solve it in another way.\n\nWe can use the fact that the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is isosceles and the lengths of the line segments $AB, BC, CD,$ and $DE$ are equal to 4.\n\nWe can denote the point of intersection of line segment $AB$ with line segment $DE$ as $H.$ We can see that the line segments $AB$ and $DE$ are equal in length, and therefore the angles opposite to each other are equal.\n\nThis implies that the angles $\\angle B$ and $\\angle D$ are equal.\n\nWe can use the Law of Sines to find an expression for $\\cos \\angle B.$\n\nThe Law of Sines states that for any triangle with side lengths $a, b,$ and $c,$ and the sine of angle $A$ denoted by $\\sin A,$ we have the following equation:\n\n$\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}$\n\nWe can apply the Law of Sines to triangle $ABE$ to find an expression for $\\cos \\angle B.$\n\nApplying the Law of Sines, we get:\n\n$\\frac{4}{\\sin \\angle A} = \\frac{4}{\\sin \\angle B}$\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n$\\sin \\angle B = \\sin \\angle A$\n\nSince the sine function has a period of $2 \\pi,$ we can write:\n\n$\\sin \\angle B = \\sin (\\pi - \\angle A)$\n\nUsing the identity $\\sin (\\pi - \\theta) = \\sin \\theta,$ we can write:\n\n$\\sin \\angle B = \\sin \\angle A$\n\nUsing the fact that $\\triangle AEB$ is a right triangle, we can write:\n\n$\\sin \\angle A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{17}}$\n\nUsing the identity $\\sin \\theta = \\sin (\\pi -
