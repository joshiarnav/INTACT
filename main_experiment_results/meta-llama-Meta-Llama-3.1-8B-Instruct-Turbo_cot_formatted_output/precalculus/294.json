    "solution": "From the equation $a^3 b^5 = 1,$ $a^6 b^{10} = 1.$  From the equation $a^7 b^2 = 1,$ $a^{35} b^{10} = 1.$  Dividing these equations, we get\n\\[a^{29} = 1.\\]Therefore, $a$ must be a 29th root of unity.\n\nFrom the equation $a^7 b^2 = 1,$ $a^{14} b^4 = 1.$  Hence,\n\\[\\frac{a^3 b^5}{a^{14} b^4} = 1.\\]This leads to $b = a^{11}.$\n\nConversely, if $a$ is a 29th root of unity, and $b = a^{11},$ then\n\\begin{align*}\na^3 b^5 &= a^3 (a^{11})^5 = a^{58} = 1, \\\\\na^7 b^2 &= a^7 (a^{11})^2 = a^{29} = 1.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the solutions $(a,b)$ are of the form $(\\omega, \\omega^{11}),$ where $\\omega$ is a 29th root of unity, giving us $\\boxed{29}$ solutions.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of complex numbers such that $a^3 b^5 = a^7 b^2 = 1,$ we need to analyze the given equations and manipulate them to obtain a solution.\n\nStep 1: Rewrite the first equation as $a^3 b^5 = 1$ and the second equation as $a^7 b^2 = 1.$\n\nStep 2: From the second equation, we can express $b^2$ in terms of $a^7$: $b^2 = \\frac{1}{a^7}.$\n\nStep 3: Substituting this expression into the first equation, we have $a^3 b^5 = a^3 \\left( \\frac{1}{a^7} \\right)^{\\frac{5}{2}} = a^3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{a^{\\frac{35}{2}}} = \\frac{a^{\\frac{13}{2}}}{a^{\\frac{35}{2}}} = \\frac{1 }{a^{\\frac{22}{2}}} = \\frac{1}{a^{11}} = 1.$\n\nStep 4: Thus, $a^{11} = 1.$ This means that $a^{11}$ is a root of unity.\n\nStep 5: The eleventh roots of unity can be expressed as $e^{\\frac{2 \\pi ik}{11}}$ where $k = 0,1, \\ldots, 10$.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, there are 11 possible values for $a.$\n\nStep 7: Substituting these values into the expression for $b^2$ from Step 2, we get $b^2 = \\frac{1}{a^7} = \\frac{1}{\\left( e^{\\frac{2 \\pi ik}{11}} \\right)^7} = \\frac{1}{e^{\\frac{14 \\pi ik}{11}}} = e^{-\\frac{14 \\pi ik}{11}}.$\n\nStep 8: Taking the square root of both sides of the equation, we get $b = \\pm e^{-\\frac{7 \\pi ik}{11}}.$\n\nStep 9: Therefore, for each value of $a$ there are two corresponding values of $b$.\n\nStep 10: Combining the number of possible values for $a$ and $b$, we get the total number of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ as $11 \\cdot 2 = 22$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{22}$."
