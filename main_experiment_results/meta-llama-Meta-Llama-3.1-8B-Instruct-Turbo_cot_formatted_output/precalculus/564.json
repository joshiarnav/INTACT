    "model_solution": "To perform the dilation, we first need to translate the dilation center to the origin, then apply the scale factor, and finally translate the dilation center back.\n\nStep 1: Translate the dilation center to the origin\nLet's call the dilation center $c = -1 + 4i$. The complex number we want to map is $z = 2i$. The translation to move $c$ to the origin is $z' = z - c = (2i) - (-1 + 4i) = 2i + 1 - 4i = 1 - 2i$.\n\nStep 2: Apply the scale factor\nThe scale factor is $-2$. We multiply $z'$ by the scale factor: $z'' = -2(1 - 2i) = -2 + 4i$.\n\nStep 3: Translate the dilation center back\nWe need to translate $z''$ by the dilation center $c = -1 + 4i$ so that the dilation center is back at its original position. The translation is $z''' = z'' + c = (-2 + 4i) + (-1 + 4i) = -2 + 4i - 1 + 4i = -3 + 8i$.\n\nSo, the complex number that $2i$ is mapped to is $\\boxed{-3 + 8i}$."
