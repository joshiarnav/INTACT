    "solution": "The vector pointing from $(-1,1,1)$ to $(1,-1,1)$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$  Since the plane we are interested in is perpendicular to the plane $x + 2y + 3z = 5,$ its normal vector must be orthogonal to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}.$  But the normal vector of the plane is also orthogonal to $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$  So, to find the normal vector of the plane we are interested in, we take the cross product of these vectors:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -6 \\\\ -6 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Scaling, we take $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector.  Therefore, the equation of the plane is of the form\n\\[x + y - z + D = 0.\\]Substituting the coordinates of $(-1,1,1),$ we find that the equation of the plane is $\\boxed{x + y - z + 1 = 0}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the equation of the plane, we need to find its normal vector. \n\nStep 1: Find a normal vector to the plane x + 2y + 3z = 5.\nThe coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation of the plane give a normal vector to the plane. Therefore, a normal vector to the plane x + 2y + 3z = 5 is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nStep 2: Find another vector in the plane.\nWe can find another vector in the plane by finding the vector between the two given points, $(-1,1,1)$ and $(1,-1,1)$. \nThe vector between the points can be found by subtracting the coordinates of the first point from the coordinates of the second point: \n$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nStep 3: Find a normal vector to the desired plane.\nThe desired plane is perpendicular to the plane x + 2y + 3z = 5, so its normal vector must be orthogonal to the normal vector of the given plane. Therefore, the normal vector of the desired plane must be parallel to the given plane. \nWe can find a normal vector to the desired plane by taking the cross product of a normal vector to the given plane and a vector in the desired plane.\n\nStep 4: Find the cross product of the vectors.\nThe cross product of two vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ a_3 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ b_3 \\end{pmatrix}$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} a_2b_3-a_3b_2 \\\\ a_3b_1-a_1b_3 \\\\ a_1b_2-a_2b_1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nLet's find the cross product of $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (2)(0)-(3)(-2) \\\\ (3)(2)-(1)(0) \\\\ (1)(-2)-(2)(2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 6 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nStep 5: Simplify the normal vector.\nWe can simplify the normal vector by dividing it by 6. Therefore, the simplified normal vector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nStep 6: Find the equation of the plane.\nWe can use the point-normal form of the equation of a plane to find the equation of the plane. The point-normal form of the equation of a plane is $A(x-x_0)+B(y-y_0)+C(z-z_0)=0$, where $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is a point on the plane and $\\begin{pmatrix} A \\\\ B \\\\ C \\end{pmatrix}$ is a normal vector to the plane.\n\nLet's use the point $(-1,1,1)$ and the normal vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ to find the equation of the plane:\n$1(x+1)+1(y-1)-1(z-1)=0$.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the equation of the plane.\nWe can simplify the equation of the plane by combining like terms:\n$x+y-z+1=0$.\n\nHowever, the equation $x+y-z+1=0$ does not meet the required format of $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0$ where $A > 0$ and $\\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|) = 1$.\n\nTo meet the required format, we can multiply the equation by -1:\n$-1(x+y-z+1)=0$.\n\nThis gives the equation $-x-y+z-1=0$. To meet the required format of $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0$ where $A > 0$ and $\\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|) = 1$, we can multiply the equation by -1 again:\n$1(x+y-z-1)=0$.\n\nThis gives the equation $x+y-z-1=0$."
