    "model_solution": "To find the period of the function $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, we need to recall the general form of a cosine function, which is $y = A\\cos(B(x - C)) + D$. The period of this function is given by $\\frac{2\\pi}{B}$.\n\nIn our given function, $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$, we can see that it is already in the form $y = A\\cos(Bx + C)$. By comparing, we have $B = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of $B$ into the formula for the period: $\\frac{2\\pi}{B} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\\pi \\times 2 = 4\\pi$.\n\nTherefore, the period of $y = \\cos \\frac{x}{2}$ is $4\\pi$.\n\n$\\boxed{4\\pi}$"
