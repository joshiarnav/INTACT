    "model_solution": "To find the curve defined by the equation, we can start by manipulating the given equation. \n\nGiven equation: \n\\[r = \\frac{1}{1 - \\cos \\theta}.\\]\n\nWe can multiply both sides by the denominator to get rid of the fraction, but to simplify the equation, we can also multiply both sides by $r$ (since $r$ is not zero) to get rid of the fraction. \n\n\\[r^2 = \\frac{r}{1 - \\cos \\theta}\\]\n\nNow, we can replace $r$ with $x + yi$ (where $x$ and $y$ are the Cartesian coordinates) and $\\theta$ with $x$ and $y$ using the relations:\n\\[x = r\\cos \\theta, \\, y = r\\sin \\theta.\\]\n\nBut first, let's simplify the equation further. Multiply both sides by $1 - \\cos \\theta$ (which is not zero) to get rid of the fraction:\n\n\\[r^2(1 - \\cos \\theta) = r\\]\n\nReplace $r$ with $x + yi$ and $\\theta$ with $x$ and $y$:\n\\[(x + yi)^2(1 - \\cos x) = x + yi\\]\n\nNow we can expand the equation. However, remember that $i^2 = -1$ and also that $i^4 = 1$.\n\n\\[(x^2 - y^2 + 2xyi)(1 - \\cos x) = x + yi\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[x^2 - y^2 + 2xyi - x^2\\cos x + xy^2i = x + yi\\]\n\nGroup the real and imaginary parts:\n\\[-x^2\\cos x + x^2 + xy^2i - 2xyi - x = 0\\]\n\nThe imaginary parts should be equal:\n\\[xy^2 - 2xy = -y\\]\n\nWe can factor out $xy$:\n\\[y(xy - 2) = -y\\]\n\nSince $y \\neq 0$ (because $r \\neq 0$), we can divide by $y$ to get:\n\\[xy - 2 = -1\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[xy = 1\\]\n\nNow, let's look at the real part of the equation:\n\\[-x^2\\cos x + x^2 + x = 0\\]\n\nWe can combine the constants:\n\\[x^2(1 - \\cos x) + x = 0\\]\n\nThe equation can be written as:\n\\[x(x - \\cos x + 1) = 0\\]\n\nSince $x = 1$ is not a solution, $x - \\cos x + 1 = 0$.\n\nNow, let's find $x - \\cos x + 1 = 0$. Since we can't find a general solution, let's analyze it graphically.\n\nHowever, we have already found that $xy = 1$, which is the equation of a hyperbola.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{E}$"
