    "model_solution": "To find the angle between the vectors $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, we need to understand the relationship between the original vectors and the new vectors.\n\n1. The angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is given as $43^\\circ.$\n\n2. When we multiply a vector by a scalar, the direction of the vector changes. In this case, we have $-\\mathbf{a}$, which means the direction of $\\mathbf{a}$ is reversed.\n\n3. Reversing the direction of a vector is equivalent to rotating the vector by $180^\\circ$ around the origin.\n\n4. So, the angle between $\u2013\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ will be the supplementary angle of the angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$.\n\n5. The supplementary angle of an angle $\\theta$ is given by $180^\\circ - \\theta$.\n\n6. Therefore, the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is $180^\\circ - 43^\\circ = 137^\\circ.$\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{137}$."
