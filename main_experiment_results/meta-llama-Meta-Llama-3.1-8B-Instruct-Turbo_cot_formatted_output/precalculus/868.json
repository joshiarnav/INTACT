    "solution": "Two angles have the same tangent if and only if they differ by a multiple of $\\pi.$  This means $\\tan x - x$ is a multiple of $\\pi.$  Let\n\\[T(x) = \\tan x - x.\\]First, we prove that the function $T(x)$ is strictly increasing on the interval $\\left[ 0, \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right).$  Let $0 \\le x < y < \\frac{\\pi}{2}.$  Then\n\\[y - x < \\tan (y - x) = \\frac{\\tan y - \\tan x}{1 + \\tan x \\tan y} \\le \\tan y - \\tan x.\\]Re-arranging, we get $\\tan x - x < \\tan y - y,$ or $T(x) < T(y).$\n\nNote that as $x$ approaches $\\frac{\\pi}{2},$ $T(x)$ approaches infinity.  This means for every nonnegative integer $n,$ there exists a unique value of $x$ such that $T(x) = n \\pi.$\n\nWe have the estimate $300 \\pi \\approx 942.48.$  Hence,\n\\[T(\\tan^{-1} 942) = 942 - \\tan^{-1} 942 < 942 < 300 \\pi.\\]Also,\n\\[T(\\tan^{-1} 924) = 942 - \\tan^{-1} 942 > 942 - \\frac{\\pi}{2} > 299 \\pi.\\]Since $299 \\pi < T(\\tan^{-1} 942) < 300 \\pi,$ the equation $T(x) = n \\pi$ has a solution on the interval $[0, \\tan^{-1} 942]$ if and only if $0 \\le n < 300,$ so there are $\\boxed{300}$ solutions.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of solutions of the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$, we need to analyze the behavior of the functions involved. We can start by defining a function $f(x) = \\tan x - \\tan (\\tan x)$. \n\nThen, we consider the function $g(x) = x - \\tan x$. This function has a root at $x=0$, and its derivative is $g'(x) = 1 - \\sec^2 x$. \n\nFor $x \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, we have $\\sec^2 x > 0$. Since $\\sec^2 x$ is always positive, we can write $g'(x) = 1 - \\sec^2 x = \\frac{-\\cos^2 x}{\\cos^2 x} = -\\cot^2 x$. Thus, we can further analyze the behavior of $g(x)$ using this expression. \n\nBecause of the function $g(x)$, we know that $g(x)$ is decreasing in the interval $(0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$. Therefore, $g(x) < g(0)$ for $x \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\n\nNow, since $g(0) = 0$, we have $g(x) < 0$ for all $x \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$. This implies that for $x \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, we have $f(x) = \\tan x - \\tan (\\tan x) = -g(\\tan x) > 0$, because $g(\\tan x)$ is negative.\n\nThis tells us that $f(x)$ is positive for all $x \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$. Since the tangent function is periodic and $f(x)$ is positive on the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$, we can find the number of solutions of the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ by considering the number of roots of $f(x)$ in that interval.\n\nThe roots of $f(x)$ in this interval occur at those $x$ where the value of $\\tan x$ exceeds $x$. We are given that $\\tan \\theta > \\theta$ for $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Since $\\tan x$ is an increasing function on $[0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, we can find the number of roots of $f(x)$ by counting the number of times $\\tan x$ exceeds $x$ in the interval $[0, \\tan^{-1} 942]$.\n\nWe can rewrite $f(x)$ as $f(x) = \\tan x - \\tan (\\tan x) = -g(\\tan x)$. For $x \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, $g(x) = x - \\tan x$ is negative, so the roots of $f(x)$ occur when $\\tan x$ is greater than $x$. We know that there is exactly one root in the interval $(0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ because the function $f(x)$ is increasing on this interval.\n\nSince we are considering the interval $[0, \\tan^{-1} 942]$ and we know that the tangent function is periodic with a period of $\\pi$, we need to count the number of roots of $f(x)$ in this interval. \n\nNow let's analyze the behavior of the function $\\tan x$ on the interval $[0, \\tan^{-1} 942]$. We are given that $\\tan \\theta > \\theta$ for $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nWe can start by analyzing the behavior of the function $h(x) = x - \\tan x$. We know that $h(0) = 0$ and that $h(x) < 0$ for $x \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, because $g(x)$ is decreasing in this interval.\n\nBecause the tangent function is periodic with a period of $\\pi$, we can write $\\tan^{-1} 942 = n\\pi + \\theta$ for some integer $n$ and some number $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi)$.\n\nSince $\\tan \\theta > \\theta$ for $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we know that $\\tan \\theta > \\theta$ for $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi$, because the tangent function is periodic with a period of $\\pi$.\n\nNow, let's count the number of solutions of the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ by considering the number of times the value of $\\tan x$ exceeds $x$ in the interval $[0, \\tan^{-1} 942]$. \n\nSince $\\tan \\theta > \\theta$ for $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi$, we can find the number of solutions by counting the number of times $\\tan x$ exceeds $x$ in the interval $[0, \\tan^{-1} 942]$. \n\nWe can rewrite the interval $[0, \\tan^{-1} 942]$ as $[0, n\\pi + \\theta]$ for some integer $n$ and some number $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi)$.\n\nSince the function $\\tan x$ is increasing on the interval $[0, \\pi)$, we can find the number of solutions by counting the number of times the value of $\\tan x$ exceeds $x$ in each interval of the form $[n\\pi, (n + 1)\\pi]$. \n\nNow, we consider the interval $[n\\pi, (n + 1)\\pi]$. We know that the function $\\tan x$ is periodic with a period of $\\pi$, so the number of solutions in this interval is equal to the number of times the value of $\\tan x$ exceeds $x$ in the interval $[0, \\pi]$.\n\nSince $\\tan \\theta > \\theta$ for $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi$, we know that there is exactly one root in the interval $[0, \\pi]$ because the function $f(x)$ is increasing on this interval.\n\nSince the number of solutions in each interval of the form $[n\\pi, (n + 1)\\pi]$ is equal to the number of times the value of $\\tan x$ exceeds $x$ in the interval $[0, \\pi]$, and we know that there is exactly one root in the interval $[0, \\pi]$, we can conclude that there is exactly one solution in each interval of the form $[n\\pi, (n + 1)\\pi]$.\n\nSince the interval $[0, \\tan^{-1} 942]$ contains $n + 1$ intervals of the form $[n\\pi, (n + 1)\\pi]$, and there is exactly one solution in each of these intervals, the total number of solutions in the interval $[0, \\tan^{-1} 942]$ is $n + 1$.\n\nSince we are given that $\\tan \\theta > \\theta$ for $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we can find the value of $n$ by considering the inequality $n\\pi + \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nWe know that $\\tan^{-1} 942 = n\\pi + \\theta$, so we can write $n\\pi + \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ as $n\\pi + \\tan^{-1} 942 < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nNow, we can simplify the inequality $n\\pi + \\tan^{-1} 942 < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ by using the fact that the tangent function is periodic with a period of $\\pi$.\n\nWe know that $\\tan (\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\infty$, so we can write $n\\pi + \\tan^{-1} 942 < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ as $n\\pi + \\tan^{-1} 942 < \\pi + \\tan^{-1} 942 - \\pi$.\n\nSince the tangent function is periodic with a period of $\\pi$, we can simplify the inequality $n\\pi + \\tan^{-1} 942 < \\pi + \\tan^{-1} 942 - \\pi$ as $n\\pi + \\tan^{-1} 942 < \\tan^{-1} 942$.\n\nNow, we can simplify the inequality $n\\pi + \\tan^{-1} 942 < \\tan^{-1} 942$ by using the fact that the tangent function is periodic with a period of $\\pi$.\n\nWe know that the tangent function is periodic with a period of $\\pi$, so we can write $n\\pi + \\tan^{-1} 942 < \\tan^{-1} 942$ as $n\\pi < \\pi$.\n\nSince we know that the tangent function is periodic with a period of $\\pi$, we can conclude that the inequality $n\\pi < \\pi$ is satisfied for all integers $n$.\n\nNow, we can conclude that the number of solutions of the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ is $n + 1$, where $n$ is the largest integer such that $n\\pi + \\tan^{-1} 942 < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nWe know that $\\tan^{-1} 942 = n\\pi + \\theta$ for some integer $n$ and some number $\\"
