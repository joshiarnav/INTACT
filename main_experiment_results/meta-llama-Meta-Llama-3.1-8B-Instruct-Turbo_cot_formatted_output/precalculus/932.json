    "model_solution": "To find the range of the function $y=\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ for $-90^\\circ< x < 90^\\circ$, we'll consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Domain of $\\cos x$:**\n   The cosine function is defined for all real values of $x$.\n   However, since we're dealing with a specific range, we're interested in $-90^\\circ< x < 90^\\circ$.\n   In this range, $\\cos x$ is always non-negative, as the cosine function is positive in both the first and fourth quadrants.\n\n2. **Domain of $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$:**\n   Since $\\cos x$ is non-negative in the given range, the square root of $\\cos x$ is defined for all values in the range.\n\n3. **Domain of $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$:**\n   The logarithmic function $\\log_2 x$ is defined only for non-negative real values of $x$.\n   So, we need to ensure that $\\sqrt{\\cos x} \\geq 0$, which is true in the given range.\n\n4. **Range of $\\cos x$ in the given range:**\n   Since $-90^\\circ< x < 90^\\circ$, the cosine function ranges from 0 to 1 (inclusive).\n   So, $0 \\leq \\cos x \\leq 1$.\n\n5. **Range of $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$:**\n   Taking the square root of $\\cos x$ (which is in the range $0 \\leq \\cos x \\leq 1$) yields a range from 0 to 1 (inclusive).\n   So, $0 \\leq \\sqrt{\\cos x} \\leq 1$.\n\n6. **Range of $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$:**\n   Since $\\log_2 x$ is an increasing function (as $x$ increases, $\\log_2 x$ increases), the range of $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ is determined by the smallest and largest possible values of $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$.\n   The smallest possible value occurs when $\\sqrt{\\cos x} = 0$, which results in $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x}) = \\log_2 (0) = -\\infty$.\n   However, since we're dealing with a continuous function, this value is not included in the range.\n   The largest possible value occurs when $\\sqrt{\\cos x} = 1$, which results in $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x}) = \\log_2 (1) = 0$.\n   Therefore, the range of $y=\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ for $-90^\\circ< x < 90^\\circ$ is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,0]}$."
