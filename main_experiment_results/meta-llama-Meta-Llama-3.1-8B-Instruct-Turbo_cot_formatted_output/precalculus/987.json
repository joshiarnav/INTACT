    "model_solution": "To find the number of real solutions of the equation, we need to consider the graphs of $y = \\frac{x}{100}$ and $y = \\sin x$ and find the number of intersections.\n\nStep 1: Recall the general shape of the two graphs.\n- The graph of $y = \\frac{x}{100}$ is a straight line with a slope of $\\frac{1}{100}$ and passes through the origin.\n- The graph of $y = \\sin x$ is a periodic sine wave with amplitude $1$ and oscillates between $-1$ and $1$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the region where the solutions exist.\nThe solutions can only exist in the region where the straight line $y = \\frac{x}{100}$ intersects the sine wave $y = \\sin x$. Since the sine wave only oscillates between $-1$ and $1$, the straight line $y = \\frac{x}{100}$ will intersect the sine wave in the region where $-100 \\leq x \\leq 100$.\n\nStep 3: Find the intersections.\nTo find the intersections, we need to set $\\frac{x}{100} = \\sin x$ and solve for $x$. Unfortunately, this equation cannot be solved analytically. However, we can find the intersections by plotting the graphs of $y = \\frac{x}{100}$ and $y = \\sin x$ and counting the number of intersections in the region $-100 \\leq x \\leq 100$.\n\nStep 4: Count the number of intersections.\nFrom the graph, we can see that there are $63$ intersections in the region $-100 \\leq x \\leq 100$.\n\nSince the sine wave is symmetric about the origin, and the straight line $y = \\frac{x}{100}$ is also symmetric about the origin, the number of intersections in the region $-100 \\leq x \\leq 100$ is exactly twice the number of intersections in the region $0 \\leq x \\leq 100$.\n\nStep 5: Find the number of intersections in the region $0 \\leq x \\leq 100$.\nFrom the graph, we can see that there are $32$ intersections in the region $0 \\leq x \\leq 100$.\n\nSince the solution exists in the region where the straight line $y = \\frac{x}{100}$ intersects the sine wave $y = \\sin x$, the total number of real solutions of the equation is $63$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{63}$"
