    "problem": "What is the greatest integer $n$ such that $n^2 - 11n +24 \\leq 0$?",
    "solution": "We can factor $n^2-11n+24$ as $(n-3)(n-8)$. For this quantity to be less than or equal to 0, one of the factors must be less than or equal to 0 and the other factor must be greater than or equal to 0. Specifically, since $n-8<n-3$ for all $n$, we must have $$n-8 \\le 0 \\le n-3.$$ The first inequality, $n-8\\le 0$, tells us that $n\\le 8$. The second inequality, $0\\le n-3$, tells us that $n\\ge 3$. The solutions to the original inequality must satisfy both conditions, so they are given by $3\\le n\\le 8$. The largest integer in this interval is $n=\\boxed{8}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the greatest integer $n$ such that $n^2 - 11n + 24 \\leq 0$, we need to solve the quadratic inequality.\n\nStep 1: Factorize the quadratic expression:\n\n$n^2 - 11n + 24 = (n - 3)(n - 8)$\n\nStep 2: Find the roots of the quadratic expression by setting it equal to zero:\n\n$(n - 3)(n - 8) = 0$\n\nSolving for $n$, we get:\n\n$n - 3 = 0$ or $n - 8 = 0$\n\n$n = 3$ or $n = 8$\n\nStep 3: Create a number line with the roots and test points in each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied.\n\nWe have three intervals to consider: $(-\\infty, 3)$, $(3, 8)$, and $(8, \\infty)$.\n\nStep 4: Test a point in each interval:\n\nInterval $(-\\infty, 3)$: Test $n = 0$. Substituting $n = 0$ into the inequality, we get:\n\n$(0 - 3)(0 - 8) = (-3)(-8) = 24 > 0$\n\nSo, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.\n\nInterval $(3, 8)$: Test $n = 5$. Substituting $n = 5$ into the inequality, we get:\n\n$(5 - 3)(5 - 8) = (2)(-3) = -6 < 0$\n\nSo, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.\n\nInterval $(8, \\infty)$: Test $n = 10$. Substituting $n = 10$ into the inequality, we get:\n\n$(10 - 3)(10 - 8) = (7)(2) = 14 > 0$\n\nSo, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.\n\nStep 5: Determine the solution set and find the greatest integer $n$ such that the inequality is satisfied.\n\nThe inequality is satisfied in the interval $(3, 8)$. Since we want the greatest integer $n$, we take the largest integer in this interval, which is $n = 7$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest integer $n$ such that $n^2 - 11n + 24 \\leq 0$ is $n = 7$."
