    "model_solution": "To rationalize the denominator, we need to get rid of the square root in the denominator. \n\nThe given expression is: $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}-1}$\n\nOur goal is to multiply the numerator and the denominator by a value that will eliminate the square root in the denominator. \n\nTo do this, we can multiply by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of a binomial $a-b$ is $a+b$. \n\nIn this case, the conjugate of $\\sqrt{2}-1$ is $\\sqrt{2}+1$.\n\nSo, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\\sqrt{2}+1$: \n\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}-1} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{\\sqrt{2}+1}$\n\nThis gives us: $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{(\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}+1)}$\n\nNow, we can simplify the denominator using the difference of squares formula: $(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2$. \n\nIn this case, $a=\\sqrt{2}$ and $b=1$. \n\nSo, we have: $(\\sqrt{2})^2 - (1)^2$\n\nThis simplifies to: $2 - 1 = 1$\n\nSo, the expression becomes: $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{1}$\n\nThis simplifies to: $\\sqrt{2}+1$\n\nTherefore, the rationalized form of the given expression is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}+1}$"
