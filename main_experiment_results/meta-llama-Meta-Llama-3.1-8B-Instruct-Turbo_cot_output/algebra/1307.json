The part in the parentheses is a finite geometric series with a common ratio $\\frac{1}{3}$ and 4 terms. To find the sum of the series, we can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series, which is given by:\n   $$S_n = \\frac{a_1(1-r^n)}{1-r}$$\n   where $a_1$ is the first term of the series, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms.\n\n   In this case, $a_1 = 1$, $r = \\frac{1}{3}$, and $n = 4$.\n\n   Plugging in the values, we get:\n   $$S_4 = \\frac{1\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^4\\right)}{1-\\frac{1}{3}}$$\n   $$S_4 = \\frac{1\\left(1-\\frac{1}{81}\\right)}{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n\n   To simplify, we can find a common denominator for the fraction in the numerator:\n   $$S_4 = \\frac{\\frac{80}{81}}{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n\n   Now, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:\n   $$S_4 = \\frac{80}{81} \\frac{3}{2}$$\n\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   $$S_4 = \\frac{240}{162}$$\n\n   Now, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:\n   $$S_4 = \\frac{40}{27}$$\n\n   Now that we have the sum of the part in the parentheses, we can substitute this value back into the original equation:\n   \\[\\frac16\\left(1+\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{3^2}+\\frac{1}{3^3}\\right)=\\frac{40}{162}\\]\n   \\[\\frac16 \\cdot \\frac{40}{27} = \\frac{20}{81}\\]"
