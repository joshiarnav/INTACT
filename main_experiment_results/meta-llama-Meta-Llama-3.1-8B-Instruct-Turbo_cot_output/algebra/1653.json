    "problem": "A triangular region is bounded by the two coordinate axes and the line given by the equation $2x + y = 6$. What is the area of the region, in square units?",
    "solution": "To start, use the equation to solve for the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the line.  Letting $x$ equal 0, the $y$-intercept is 6.  Letting $y$ equal 0, we find that $2x=6$ so the $x$-intercept is 3.  Using the intercepts, we can graph the line as shown: [asy]size(100,0);\nfill((0,0)--(0,6)--(3,0)--cycle,gray(.7));\nadd(grid(5,8));\ndraw((0,0)--(5,0),linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,8),linewidth(2));\nlabel(\"\",(5,0),E);\nlabel(\"\",(0,8),N);\ndraw((0,6)--(3,0),blue,Arrows);[/asy] We wish to find the area of the shaded region.  This is a right triangle with one base of length 3, and one of length 6.  Therefore, the area is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3\\cdot 6=\\boxed{9}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the triangular region, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the x and y intercepts of the line**: The x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the x-axis. To find it, we set y = 0 in the equation 2x + y = 6. This gives us 2x + 0 = 6, which simplifies to 2x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 6/2 = 3. So, the x-intercept is (3, 0).\n\nSimilarly, the y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. To find it, we set x = 0 in the equation 2x + y = 6. This gives us 2(0) + y = 6, which simplifies to y = 6. So, the y-intercept is (0, 6).\n\n2. **Plot the intercepts and draw the line**: Plot the points (3, 0) and (0, 6) on a coordinate plane. Then, draw the line that passes through these two points, using the equation 2x + y = 6.\n\n3. **Find the base and height of the triangle**: The base of the triangle is the distance between the x-intercept and the y-axis, which is the x-coordinate of the x-intercept, or 3. The height of the triangle is the distance between the y-intercept and the x-axis, which is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept, or 6.\n\n4. **Calculate the area of the triangle**: The area of a triangle is given by the formula (base \u00d7 height) / 2. Plugging in the values we found, we get (3 \u00d7 6) / 2 = 18/2 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangular region is 9 square units."
