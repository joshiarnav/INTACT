    "problem": "A puppy and two cats together weigh 24 pounds. The puppy and the larger cat together weigh exactly twice as much as the smaller cat, and the puppy and the smaller cat together weigh exactly the same as the larger cat. How many pounds does the puppy weigh?",
    "solution": "Let the weight of the puppy be $a$, the weight of the smaller cat be $b$, and the weight of the larger cat be $c$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c&=24\\\\\na+c&=2b\\\\\na+b&=c\n\\end{align*} From Equation (2), we have $a=2b-c$. Substituting that into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b+c=24 \\Rightarrow b=8\n\\end{align*} Substituting $a=2b-c$ into Equation (3) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b&=c \\Rightarrow 3b=2c\n\\end{align*} Since $b=8$, $c=\\frac{3}{2}b=12$. Finally, substituting the values of $b$ and $c$ into Equation (1) to solve for $a$, we have $a+8+12=24$, or $a=4$. Thus, the puppy weighs $\\boxed{4}$ pounds.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the information step by step.\n\n1. Let's denote the weight of the puppy as P, the smaller cat as S, and the larger cat as L.\n\nFrom the first statement: \nP + S + L = 24\n\n2. The second statement tells us that the puppy and the larger cat together weigh exactly twice as much as the smaller cat:\nP + L = 2S\n\n3. The third statement says that the puppy and the smaller cat together weigh exactly the same as the larger cat:\nP + S = L\n\nNow, let's use these equations to solve for P (the weight of the puppy).\n\nFrom the third statement, we can express L in terms of P and S:\nL = P + S\n\nNow, substitute L in the first equation:\nP + S + (P + S) = 24\nCombine like terms:\n2P + 2S = 24\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\nP + S = 12\n\nNow, we need to use the second equation. But we have P + S = L from the third statement, and P + S = 12 from the previous step. So, we can substitute L in the second equation:\nP + (P + S) = 2S\nP + P + S = 2S\nCombine like terms:\n2P + S = 2S\n\nNow, subtract S from both sides:\n2P = S\n\nNow substitute S = 2P into the equation P + S = 12:\nP + 2P = 12\nCombine like terms:\n3P = 12\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\nP = 4\n\nSo, the puppy weighs 4 pounds."
