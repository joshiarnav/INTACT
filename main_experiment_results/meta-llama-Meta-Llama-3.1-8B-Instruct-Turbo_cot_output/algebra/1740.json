    "problem": "A box with a volume of 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold 50 paperclips. How many paperclips could a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ hold?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of paperclips that a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ could hold. Setting up the ratio $\\frac{50}{16}=\\frac{x}{48}$ and solving for $x$ gives $x=150$.  Hence, a 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ box could hold $\\boxed{150}$ paperclips.  We also could have noted that tripling the size of the box triples the number of paperclips we can hold, so the new box can hold $50\\cdot 3 = 150$ paperclips.",

    "model_solution": "To find out how many paperclips the larger box can hold, we first need to find out the ratio of the volume of the larger box to the smaller box.\n\nThe volume of the smaller box is 16 $\\text{cm}^3$, and the volume of the larger box is 48 $\\text{cm}^3$.\n\nThe ratio of the volumes is $\\frac{48 \\text{ cm}^3}{16 \\text{ cm}^3}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{3}{1}$ or 3.\n\nThis means that the larger box is 3 times as large as the smaller box.\n\nSince the smaller box can hold 50 paperclips, we need to multiply this number by 3 to find out how many paperclips the larger box can hold.\n\n$50 \\times 3 = 150$\n\nTherefore, the larger box can hold 150 paperclips."
