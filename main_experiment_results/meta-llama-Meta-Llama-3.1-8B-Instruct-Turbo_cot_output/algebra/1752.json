    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the coordinates of the midpoint of the line segment connecting (2,5) and (4,9).\n2. Use the equation of the line x + y = b to find the value of b at the midpoint.\n\n**Step 1: Find the midpoint of the line segment**\n\nThe midpoint formula is given by:\n\nM = ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n\nwhere M is the midpoint and (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the endpoints.\n\nIn this case, (x1, y1) = (2, 5) and (x2, y2) = (4, 9). Plugging these values into the midpoint formula, we get:\n\nM = ((2 + 4)/2, (5 + 9)/2)\n= ((6)/2, (14)/2)\n= (3, 7)\n\nSo, the midpoint of the line segment is (3, 7).\n\n**Step 2: Use the equation of the line to find the value of b**\n\nThe equation of the line is x + y = b. We know that the midpoint (3, 7) lies on this line, so we can substitute x = 3 and y = 7 into the equation to find the value of b.\n\nx + y = b\n3 + 7 = b\nb = 10\n\nTherefore, the value of b is 10."
