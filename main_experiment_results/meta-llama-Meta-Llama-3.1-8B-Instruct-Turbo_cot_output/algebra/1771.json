    "problem": "Two parabolas are the graphs of the equations $y=2x^2-7x+1$ and $y=8x^2+5x+1$. Give all points where they intersect.  List the points in order of increasing $x$-coordinate, separated by semicolons.",
    "solution": "First, set the two equations equal to each other to get $2x^2-7x+1=8x^2+5x+1$. Combine like terms to get $6x^2+12x=0$. Then, we can divide by $6$ to get $x^2+2x=0$. To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{2}\\right)^2=1$ to both sides, giving $(x+1)^2=1$.\n\nSo we have $x+1=\\pm1$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x=-2$ or $0$. Using these in our original parabolas, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-2, 23)}$ and $\\boxed{(0, 1)}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the points where the two parabolas intersect, we need to solve their equations simultaneously. This means we set the two equations equal to each other:\n\n$2x^2-7x+1 = 8x^2+5x+1$\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation by moving all the terms to one side:\n\n$2x^2-7x+1 - (8x^2+5x+1) = 0$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$2x^2-7x+1 - 8x^2-5x-1 = 0$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$-6x^2-12x = 0$\n\nNow, let's factor out the common term:\n\n$-6x(x+2) = 0$\n\nWe can see that this equation has two possible solutions:\n\n$-6x = 0$ or $x+2 = 0$\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n$x = 0$ or $x = -2$\n\nNow, let's find the corresponding y-values by plugging these x-values into one of the original equations. We'll use the first equation:\n\nFor x = 0, we have:\n\n$y = 2(0)^2-7(0)+1 = 1$\n\nFor x = -2, we have:\n\n$y = 2(-2)^2-7(-2)+1 = 23$\n\nSo, the points where the two parabolas intersect are:\n\n(0, 1); (-2, 23)"
