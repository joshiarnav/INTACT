    "problem": "If $\\log_9 (x-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$, find $\\log_{625} x$.",
    "solution": "In order to find $\\log_{625} x$, we must first find $x$. We begin by writing $\\log_9 (x-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$ in exponential form, which gives us $9^{\\frac12}=x-2$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=9^{\\frac12}+2=3+2=5$. After plugging this value of $x$ into the second expression, the final step is to find $\\log_{625} 5$. Since we know that $625=5^4$ or $625^{\\frac14}=5$, $\\log_{625} 5=\\boxed{\\frac14}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve the problem step by step, we'll start by solving the given logarithmic equation.\n\n1. **Given equation:** $\\log_9 (x-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$\n2. **Convert to exponential form:** $9^{\\frac{1}{2}} = x-2$ \n3. **Calculate $9^{\\frac{1}{2}}$:** Since $9$ is $3^2$, we have $3^1 = x-2$. This simplifies to $3 = x-2$.\n4. **Solve for $x$:** Add 2 to both sides: $x = 5$.\n\nNow that we have the value of $x$, we can find $\\log_{625} x$.\n\n1. **Given $x = 5$, we need to find $\\log_{625} 5$.**\n2. **We can rewrite 625 as a power of a number:** $625 = 5^4$. This means that $5^4 = 625$.\n3. **Now we have a base 5 logarithm:** $\\log_5 5^4$\n4. **The logarithm of a number to its own base is the exponent:** $\\log_5 5^4 = 4$\n\nSo, $\\log_{625} x = \\log_{5^4} 5 = 4$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{4}$."
