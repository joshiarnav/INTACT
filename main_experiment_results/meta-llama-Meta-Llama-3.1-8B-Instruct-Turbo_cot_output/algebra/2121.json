    "problem": "Four primes $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ form an increasing arithmetic sequence with $a > 5$ and common difference 6. What is the ones digit of $a$?",
    "solution": "Every prime number greater than 5 has a ones digit of 1, 3, 7, or 9.  For each of these digits, let's add 6, take the resulting ones digit, and repeat the process two more times. We get the following sequences of digits. \\begin{align*}\n1, 7, 3, 9 \\\\\n3, 9, 5, 1 \\\\\n7, 3, 9, 5 \\\\\n9, 5, 1, 7\n\\end{align*} Only the first of these sequences could be the sequence of ones digits of four prime numbers, since each of the other three sequences contains 5.  Therefore, the units digit of $a$ is $\\boxed{1}$. The example $a=11$ shows that there exists such a sequence of consecutive prime numbers.",

    "model_solution": "To find the ones digit of a, we first need to consider the properties of an arithmetic sequence and the characteristics of prime numbers.\n\nGiven a common difference of 6 and four primes in increasing order, we know that the sequence is: a, a + 6, a + 12, a + 18.\n\nSince a > 5, we can rule out 2, 3, and 5 as possible values for a. \n\nNow, we can start testing possible values for a that are greater than 5. \n\nIf a ends in 1, then a + 6 ends in 7. However, a prime number greater than 7 that ends in 7 is not a valid option since the only even prime is 2 and a + 6 must be an even number for the sequence to hold.\n\nIf a ends in 3, then a + 6 ends in 9, which is not a valid option because it is a multiple of 3 and therefore not a prime number.\n\nIf a ends in 5, then a + 6 ends in 1, which is a valid option. However, the sequence would be 5, 11, 17, 23 and the only even prime in the sequence is 2, but that is not a valid option since a is greater than 5.\n\nIf a ends in 7, then a + 6 ends in 3, which is a valid option. However, we must test the sequence: 7, 13, 19, 25. But 25 is not a prime number. This leaves us with one option: 7, 13, 19, 25 is not a valid option but the sequence 11, 17, 23, 29 is a valid option because it is a sequence of four primes with a common difference of 6.\n\nGiven this information, we see that the ones digit of a is 1."
