    "model_solution": "To find the inverse of the function $f(x) = 4 - 5x$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Write the function as y = f(x)**: \n    $y = 4 - 5x$\n\n2. **Swap x and y**: \n    $x = 4 - 5y$\n\n3. **Solve for y**: \n    To isolate $y$, we need to get rid of the $-5y$ term. First, subtract 4 from both sides:\n    $x - 4 = -5y$\n    Now, divide both sides by -5:\n    $y = \\frac{x-4}{-5}$\n\n4. **Simplify the expression for y**: \n    Since $\\frac{x-4}{-5}$ is equivalent to $-\\frac{x-4}{5}$, we can simplify the expression:\n    $y = -\\frac{x-4}{5}$\n\n5. **Rewrite the inverse function**: \n    Let's rewrite the inverse function by replacing $f^{-1}(x)$ with the expression for $y$:\n    $f^{-1}(x) = -\\frac{x-4}{5}$\n\nSo, the inverse of the function $f(x) = 4 - 5x$ is $f^{-1}(x) = -\\frac{x-4}{5}$."
