    "problem": "A 1$\\%$ late charge was added to Jenna's bill on the $30^{\\text{th}}$ day past its due date. The resulting total was then increased by 1$\\%$ because she did not pay the bill in the next 30 days either. Her original bill was $\\$400$. Exactly how much is the bill now?",
    "solution": "The first late charge brings the bill to $400 \\cdot 1.01 = 400 + 4 = 404$. The second late charge brings the bill to $404 \\cdot 1.01 = 404 + 4.04 = \\boxed{408.04}$ dollars.\n\n-OR-\n\nEach increase multiples the bill by $1+1\\%=1.01$. Therefore, her final bill is $\\$400(1.01)^2=\\$408.04$.",

To do this, we need to calculate 1$\\%$ of $\\$400$, which is:\n\\[ 1\\% \\text{ of } \\$400 = \\left( \\frac{1}{100} \\right) \\cdot \\$400 = \\$4 \\]\n\nThen, we add this amount to the original bill:\n\\[ \\$400 + \\$4 = \\$404 \\]\n\n2. Now, another 1$\\%$ late charge is added to the resulting total of $\\$404$. To do this, we need to calculate 1$\\%$ of $\\$404$, which is:\n\\[ 1\\% \\text{ of } \\$404 = \\left( \\frac{1}{100} \\right) \\cdot \\$404 = \\$4.04 \\]\n\nThen, we add this amount to the total:\n\\[ \\$404 + \\$4.04 = \\$408.04 \\]\n\nSo, the bill now is $\\$408.04$."
