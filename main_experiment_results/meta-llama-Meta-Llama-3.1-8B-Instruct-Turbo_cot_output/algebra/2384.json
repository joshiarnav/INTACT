    "problem": "What is the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double?",
    "solution": "From the information given, we have $x^2 = 2x + 48$. Rearranging, we get $x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$, which we can factor as $(x+6)(x-8) = 0$. Therefore, $x = -6\\text{ or }8$.  Since we want the lesser, $\\boxed{-6}$ is our answer.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information.\n\nIf we let 'x' be the integer we are looking for, then the problem statement can be translated into the equation:\n\nx^2 = 2x + 48\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to get:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 48 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -2, and c = -48.\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nSubstituting the values of a, b, and c, we get:\n\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a((-2)^2 - 4*1*(-48))) / 2*1\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a(4 + 192)) / 2\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a196) / 2\nx = (2 \u00b1 14) / 2\n\nSimplifying, we get two possible values for x:\n\nx = (2 + 14) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8\nx = (2 - 14) / 2 = -12 / 2 = -6\n\nSince we are looking for the least integer, we choose the smaller value between 8 and -6.\n\nTherefore, the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double is -6."
