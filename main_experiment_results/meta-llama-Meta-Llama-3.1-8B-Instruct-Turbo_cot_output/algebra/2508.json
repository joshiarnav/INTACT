    "problem": "I have a picture with dimensions $x$ and $y$ (in inches), such that $x$ and $y$ are both integers greater than one. I would like to place this picture in an elongated frame of dimensions $(2x + 3)$ and  $(y+2)$. If I measured the area of the frame to be $34$ square inches, what is the area of the picture in square inches? (Note that by \"the area of the frame,\" we mean the shaded region shown below).

    "solution": "The area of the frame is equal to  \\begin{align*}\n(2x + 3) \\cdot (y+2) - x \\cdot y &= 2xy + 4x + 3y + 6 - xy \\\\\n&= xy + 4x + 3y + 6 \\\\\n&= 34.\n\\end{align*}To apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we add $6$ to both sides of the equation: $$xy + 4x + 3y + 12 = 40,$$so $$(x + 3)(y+4) = 40.$$Considering the factor pairs of 40, we see that the ordered pair $(x+3, y+4)$ must be among $$(1,40),(2,20),(4,10),(5,8),(8,5),(10,4),(20,2),(40,1).$$Solving for $x$ and $y$ for each pair of factors, we find that $(x,y)$ must be among the pairs $$(-2,36), (-1,16), (1,6), (2,4), (5,1), (7,0), (17,-2), (37,-3).$$Of these, only $(x,y) = (2,4)$ satisfy the condition that both $x$ and $y$ are greater than $1$. The area of the picture is thus $x \\times y = \\boxed{8}$ square inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the picture, we first need to find the area of the frame. The area of the frame is the area of the entire picture plus the elongated frame minus the area of the picture itself.\n\nThe area of the elongated frame is $(2x + 3) \\cdot (y+2) = 2xy + 4x + 3y + 6$.\n\nThe area of the picture itself is $xy$.\n\nThe area of the entire picture plus the elongated frame is $(2x + 3) \\cdot (y+2) = 2xy + 4x + 3y + 6$.\n\nThe area of the frame is $\\text{area of entire picture plus the elongated frame} - \\text{area of the picture} = (2xy + 4x + 3y + 6) - xy = xy + 4x + 3y + 6$.\n\nWe are given that the area of the frame is $34$ square inches. So, the equation for the area of the frame is $xy + 4x + 3y + 6 = 34$.\n\nWe want to find the area of the picture, which is $xy$. To do this, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick to factorize the equation $xy + 4x + 3y + 6 = 34$.\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides of the equation, we get $xy + 4x + 3y = 28$.\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 1, we get $y(x + 3) + 4x = 28$.\n\nSubtracting 4x from both sides of the equation, we get $y(x + 3) = 28 - 4x$.\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by $(x + 3)$, we get $y = \\frac{28 - 4x}{x + 3}$.\n\nWe are told that both $x$ and $y$ are integers, and $x$ and $y$ are greater than one. Therefore, $x$ must be a factor of 28.\n\nWe can try out some factors of 28 to find the possible values of $x$. The factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28.\n\nSince $x$ is an integer greater than one, we can eliminate $x = 1$ as a possibility.\n\nTrying out different values of $x$, we get:\n\n- $x = 2 \\implies y = \\frac{28 - 8}{5} = \\frac{20}{5} = 4$\n- $x = 4 \\implies y = \\frac{28 - 16}{5} = \\frac{12}{5}$. This is not possible since $y$ is an integer.\n- $x = 7 \\implies y = \\frac{28 - 28}{10} = 0$. This is not possible since $y$ is an integer greater than 1.\n- $x = 14 \\implies y = \\frac{28 - 56}{17} = \\frac{-28}{17}$. This is not possible since $y$ is an integer.\n- $x = 28 \\implies y = \\frac{28 - 112}{31} = \\frac{-84}{31}$. This is not possible since $y$ is an integer.\n\nTherefore, $x = 2$ and $y = 4$. \n\nThe area of the picture is $xy = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$ square inches."
