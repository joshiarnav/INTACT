    "problem": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the two distinct solutions to the equation $$\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15}=x+2.$$If $p > q$, what is the value of $p - q$?",
    "solution": "First we try factoring the left side to simplify it: $$\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15}=\\frac{4(x-3)}{(x-3)(x+5)}=\\frac{4}{x+5}.$$Now we can multiply both sides by $(x+5)$ and solve for $x$: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{4}{x+5}&=x+2\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n4&=(x+5)(x+2)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=x^2+7x+10\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=x^2+7x+6\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=(x+6)(x+1).\n\\end{align*}So $p=-1$ and $q=-6$, making $p-q=\\boxed{5}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $p - q$, we first need to solve the equation $\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15}=x+2$. \n\nStep 1: Factor the denominator of the left-hand side of the equation. We have:\n\n$$\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15} = \\frac{4x-12}{(x+5)(x-3)}$$\n\nStep 2: Factor the numerator of the left-hand side of the equation. We have:\n\n$$\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15} = \\frac{4(x-3)}{(x+5)(x-3)}$$\n\nStep 3: Cancel common factors between the numerator and the denominator. We have:\n\n$$\\frac{4x-12}{x^2+2x-15} = \\frac{4}{x+5}$$\n\nStep 4: Multiply both sides of the equation by $x+5$ to get rid of the fraction. We have:\n\n$$(x+2)(x+5) = 4$$\n\nStep 5: Expand the left-hand side of the equation and simplify it. We have:\n\n$$x^2+7x+10=4$$\n\nStep 6: Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to isolate the quadratic term. We have:\n\n$$x^2+7x+6=0$$\n\nStep 7: Factor the quadratic equation. We have:\n\n$$(x+1)(x+6)=0$$\n\nStep 8: Solve for $x$ by setting each factor equal to 0. We have:\n\n$$x+1=0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x+6=0$$\n\nSolving for $x$ in both cases, we get:\n\n$$x=-1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x=-6$$\n\nSince $p > q$, we have $p=-1$ and $q=-6$. Therefore, $p-q = (-1) - (-6) = 5$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$."
