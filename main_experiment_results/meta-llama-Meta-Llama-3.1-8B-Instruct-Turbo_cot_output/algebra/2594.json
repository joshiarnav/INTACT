    "problem": "The third and fourth terms of a geometric sequence are 12 and 16, respectively. What is the first term of the sequence?",
    "solution": "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence. Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$. Solving, we have $a\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll need to use the properties of a geometric sequence. A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.\n\nLet's denote the first term of the sequence as 'a' and the common ratio as 'r'. We're given that the third term is 12 and the fourth term is 16.\n\nSince the fourth term is obtained from the third term by multiplying it by 'r', we can write:\n\n4th term = 3rd term * r\n16 = 12 * r\n\nNow, we need to find 'r'. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 12:\n\nr = 16 / 12\nr = 4 / 3\nr = 1.33 (approximately)\n\nNow that we have the common ratio 'r', we can use it to find the first term 'a'. Since the third term is obtained from the first term by multiplying it by 'r' twice, we can write:\n\n3rd term = 1st term * r^2\n12 = a * (4/3)^2\n\nTo find 'a', we'll divide both sides of the equation by (4/3)^2:\n\na = 12 / (4/3)^2\na = 12 / (16/9)\na = 12 * (9/16)\na = 108 / 16\na = 27 / 4\n\nSo, the first term of the sequence is 27/4."
