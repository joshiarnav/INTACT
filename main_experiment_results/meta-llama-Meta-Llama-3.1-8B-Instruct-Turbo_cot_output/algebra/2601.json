    "problem": "What is the value of $c$ if $x\\cdot(3x+1)<c$ if and only when $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$?",
    "solution": "When $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$, we have $x\\cdot(3x+1)-c<0$. This means that $x(3x+1)-c=0$ at $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x=2$. We now know that $x(3x+1)-c=0$ is a quadratic equation with roots at $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x=2$, and we want to use these roots to find a quadratic of the same form as the problem.  $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ gives us $(3x+7)=0$ and $x=2$ gives us $(x-2)=0$. \\begin{align*}\nx(3x+1)-c&=(3x+7)(x-2)\\\\\n&=3x^2+x-14\\\\\n&=x(3x+1)-14.\n\\end{align*} So, $c=\\boxed{14}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $c$, we need to consider the behavior of the quadratic function $x(3x+1)$ on the interval $\\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$. \n\nFirst, let's find the critical points of the quadratic function by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n$f(x) = x(3x+1) = 3x^2 + x$\n\n$f'(x) = 6x + 1$\n\nSetting $f'(x) = 0$:\n\n$6x + 1 = 0$\n\n$6x = -1$\n\n$x = -\\frac{1}{6}$\n\nHowever, we are interested in the interval $\\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$. Since $-\\frac{1}{6}$ is outside this interval, we can ignore it for now.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval:\n\n$x = -\\frac{7}{3}$\n\n$f(x) = (-\\frac{7}{3})(3(-\\frac{7}{3})+1) = (-\\frac{7}{3})(-\\frac{16}{3}) = \\frac{112}{9}$\n\n$x = 2$\n\n$f(x) = (2)(3(2)+1) = (2)(7) = 14$\n\nTo find the value of $c$, we need to consider the maximum value of the function on the interval. In this case, the maximum value occurs at $x = 2$, so $c$ must be greater than or equal to this value:\n\n$c \\geq 14$\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the behavior of the function at the endpoint $x = -\\frac{7}{3}$. Since the function is concave up (i.e., its second derivative is positive), its value at $x = -\\frac{7}{3}$ is the minimum value on the interval. Therefore, we can set the inequality:\n\n$x(3x+1) < c$\n\n$\\Leftrightarrow \\frac{112}{9} < c$\n\nWe can combine the two inequalities:\n\n$\\frac{112}{9} < c \\leq 14$\n\nSince $c$ is a constant, it must be equal to one of the values that satisfies both inequalities. In this case, $c = 14$ is the only possibility.\n\nTherefore, the value of $c$ is:\n\n$c = 14$"
