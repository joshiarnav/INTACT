    "problem": "The letters of the alphabet are each assigned a random integer value, and $H=10$. The value of a word comes from the sum of its letters' values. If $MATH$ is 35 points, $TEAM$ is 42 points and $MEET$ is 38 points, what is the value of $A$?",
    "solution": "$MATH$ is 35 points, and $H$ is 10 points, so $MAT$ is 25 points. $TEAM = E + MAT$, so $E = 42 - 25 = 17$ points. $MEET$ is 38 points, and $E$ is 17 points, so $MT = 38 - 2 \\cdot 17 = 4$ points. Finally, because $TEAM = E + MT + A$, we can solve for $A$: $17 + 4 + A = 42$, so $A= 42 - 17 - 4 = \\boxed{21}$ points.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. We are given that $H=10$.\n2. The value of a word comes from the sum of its letters' values. Let's denote the value of a word as the sum of its letters' values. For example, the value of $MATH$ is $M + A + T + H$.\n\nGiven that $MATH$ is 35 points, we can set up an equation:\n\n$M + A + T + H = 35$\n\nSince $H=10$, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n$M + A + T + 10 = 35$\n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides gives:\n\n$M + A + T = 25$\n\n3. We are also given that $TEAM$ is 42 points. We can set up an equation:\n\n$T + E + A + M = 42$\n\nSubtracting the equation $M + A + T = 25$ from this equation will eliminate $M$ and $A$ and $T$.\n\n$(T + E + A + M) - (M + A + T) = 42 - 25$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$E = 17$\n\n4. We are given that $MEET$ is 38 points. We can set up an equation:\n\n$M + E + E + T = 38$\n\nWe already know that $E = 17$. Substituting this value into the equation:\n\n$M + 17 + 17 + T = 38$\n\nCombining like terms gives:\n\n$M + T + 34 = 38$\n\nSubtracting 34 from both sides gives:\n\n$M + T = 4$\n\n5. Recall the equation we derived earlier: $M + A + T = 25$\n\nWe can substitute $M + T = 4$ into this equation:\n\n$4 + A = 25$\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides gives:\n\n$A = 21$\n\nTherefore, the value of $A$ is 21."
