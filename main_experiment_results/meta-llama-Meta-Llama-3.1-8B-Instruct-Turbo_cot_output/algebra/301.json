    "problem": "The Cookie Monster encounters a cookie whose boundary is the equation $x^2+y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3 y$ and is very confused. He wants to know if this cookie is a lunch-sized cookie or a snack-sized cookie. What is the radius of this cookie?",
    "solution": "The equation $x^2+y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3 y$ can be rewritten as $x^2-x+y^2-3y=6.5$. Completing the square and writing decimals as fractions, this can further be rewritten as $\\left( x - \\dfrac{1}{2} \\right)^2 - \\dfrac{1}{4} + \\left( y - \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)^2 - \\dfrac{9}{4}=\\dfrac{13}{2}$. Moving the constants to the right side of the equation, this is $\\left( x - \\dfrac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( y - \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)^2 = \\dfrac{10}{4}+\\dfrac{13}{2}=\\dfrac{18}{2}=9$, which is the equation of a circle with center $\\left( \\dfrac{1}{2}, \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)$ and radius $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step to find the radius of the cookie.\n\nGiven equation: $x^2+y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3y$\n\nStep 1: Rearrange the equation to put it in the standard form of a circle:\n$x^2 - x + y^2 - 3y - 6.5 = 0$\n\nStep 2: Complete the square for both the x and y terms to convert it into a perfect square trinomial. To do this, we'll add $(\\frac{-1}{2})^2$ to both sides for the x term and add $(\\frac{-3}{2})^2$ to both sides for the y term:\n$(x^2 - x + \\frac{1}{4}) + (y^2 - 3y + \\frac{9}{4}) - 6.5 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{9}{4}$\n$(x - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + (y - \\frac{3}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{9}{4} + 6.5$\n\nStep 3: Simplify the right-hand side of the equation:\n$(x - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + (y - \\frac{3}{2})^2 = \\frac{10}{4} + 6.5$\n$(x - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + (y - \\frac{3}{2})^2 = \\frac{10 + 26}{4}$\n$(x - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + (y - \\frac{3}{2})^2 = \\frac{36}{4}$\n$(x - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + (y - \\frac{3}{2})^2 = \\frac{9}{1}$\n\nStep 4: Since the equation is now in the standard form of a circle $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, we can identify the radius squared ($r^2$) as the right-hand side of the equation:\n$r^2 = \\frac{9}{1}$\n\nStep 5: To find the radius, we take the square root of both sides:\n$r = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{1}}$\n$r = \\sqrt{9}$\n$r = 3$\n\nSo, the radius of the cookie is 3 units. This means the cookie is a snack-sized cookie. The Cookie Monster might be disappointed, but he'll still enjoy his snack-sized cookie!"
