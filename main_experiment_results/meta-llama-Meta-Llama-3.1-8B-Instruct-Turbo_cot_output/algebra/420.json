    "model_solution": "To simplify the expression, we'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1. Distribute the numbers outside the parentheses to the terms inside.\n\n   First, we'll distribute 5 to both terms inside the first parentheses:\n   - $5(3)$ becomes $15$\n   - $5(-i)$ becomes $-5i$\n\n   Then, we'll distribute 3i to both terms inside the second parentheses:\n   - $3i(5)$ becomes $15i$\n   - $3i(-i)$ becomes $-3i^2$\n\n2. Since $i^2$ is equal to $-1$, we can replace $-3i^2$ with $3$.\n\n   We now have:\n   - $15$\n   - $-5i$\n   - $15i$\n   - $3$\n\n3. Combine like terms (terms with the same variable).\n\n   We have two terms with the variable $i$: $-5i$ and $15i$. If we add these two terms together, we get $10i$.\n\n   The expression can now be simplified as: \n   $15 + 10i + 3$\n\n4. Combine the constants (numbers without variables).\n   $15 + 3 = 18$\n\n   Our final expression is: \n   $18 + 10i$"
