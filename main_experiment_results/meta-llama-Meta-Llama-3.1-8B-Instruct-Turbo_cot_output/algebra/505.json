    "model_solution": "To find the value of $p(1.5)$, let's first consider the graph of the function $y=p(x)$. We can see that the graph has a piecewise nature, indicating that the function $p(x)$ is piecewise defined.\n\nGiven that the point $(1,4)$ lies on the graph of $p(x)$, it means that $p(1) = 4$. We also know that the function $p(x)$ is symmetric with respect to the origin. This means that if $(a,b)$ is a point on the graph of $p(x)$, then $(-a,-b)$ is also a point on the graph. \n\nUsing this symmetry property, we can find the value of $p(-1.5)$ by reflecting the point $(1.5, p(1.5))$ across the origin. This gives us the point $(-1.5,-p(1.5))$. Since we know that the point $(1,4)$ lies on the graph of $p(x)$, we can conclude that the point $(-1, -4)$ also lies on the graph. \n\nWe can also see that the point $(-1.5, p(-1.5))$ lies on the graph of $p(x)$, since it is an integer and is the reflection of the point $(1.5, p(1.5))$. We can find the value of $p(-1.5)$ by finding the reflection of the point $(1.5, p(1.5))$ across the y-axis. This gives us the point $(-1.5, p(1.5))$. \n\nSince we know that the point $(-1.5, p(-1.5))$ lies on the graph of $p(x)$ and it is equal to the point $(-1.5, p(1.5))$, we can conclude that $p(-1.5) = p(1.5)$. \n\nWe also know that the point $(2, p(2))$ lies on the graph of $p(x)$. Since the point $(-2, p(-2))$ is the reflection of the point $(2, p(2))$ across the origin, we can conclude that $p(-2) = p(2)$. \n\nUsing the points $(-1.5, p(-1.5))$ and $(-2, p(-2))$, we can see that $p(-1.5) = p(2)$. \n\nSince we know that $p(-1.5) = p(1.5)$ and $p(-1.5) = p(2)$, we can conclude that $p(1.5) = p(2)$. \n\nWe can also see that the point $(2, p(2))$ lies on the graph of $p(x)$, and that the point $(2, p(2))$ is the reflection of the point $(0, p(0))$ across the y-axis. This means that $p(2) = p(0)$. \n\nUsing the points $(1, p(1))$ and $(1.5, p(1.5))$, we can see that $p(0) < p(1.5) < p(2)$. \n\nWe can also see that the point $(1, p(1))$ lies on the graph of $p(x)$, and that the point $(1, p(1))$ is the reflection of the point $(0, p(0))$ across the y-axis. This means that $p(1) = p(0)$. \n\nSince we know that $p(1) = p(0)$, we can conclude that $p(1) = p(0) = p(1.5) = p(2)$. \n\nWe also know that the point $(2, p(2))$ lies on the graph of $p(x)$, and that $p(2) = 5$. \n\nUsing this information, we can conclude that $p(1.5) = p(2) = 5$."
