    "problem": "Two parabolas are the graphs of the equations $y=3x^2+4x-5$ and $y=x^2+11$. Give all points where they intersect. List the points in order of increasing $x$-coordinate, separated by semicolons.",
    "solution": "Setting the right-hand sides of the given equations equal gives $3x^2+4x-5=x^2+11$. Combining like terms gives $2x^2+4x=16$. Dividing by $2$ gives $x^2+2x=8$, and rearranging gives $x^2 +2x - 8=0$.  Factoring gives $(x+4)(x-2)=0$, so our solutions are $x=-4$ and $x=2$.  Substituting these into either of the original equations to find the corresponding values of $y$, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-4, 27);(2, 15)}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the points of intersection, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x.\n\nFirst, we have the equations:\n\n$y=3x^2+4x-5$\n$y=x^2+11$\n\nSince both equations are equal to y, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n$3x^2+4x-5=x^2+11$\n\nNext, we will move all terms to the left-hand side to get a quadratic equation in standard form:\n\n$3x^2-x^2+4x-5-11=0$\n$2x^2+4x-16=0$\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation for x. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$x=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn this case, a=2, b=4, and c=-16. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$x=\\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^2-4(2)(-16)}}{2(2)}$\n$x=\\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16+128}}{4}$\n$x=\\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{144}}{4}$\n$x=\\frac{-4 \\pm 12}{4}$\n\nNow, we have two possible values for x:\n\n$x_1=\\frac{-4+12}{4}$\n$x_1=\\frac{8}{4}$\n$x_1=2$\n\n$x_2=\\frac{-4-12}{4}$\n$x_2=\\frac{-16}{4}$\n$x_2=-4$\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinates of the points of intersection, we need to find the corresponding y-coordinates. We can plug the x-coordinates into either of the original equations to find the y-coordinates.\n\nFor x=2:\n\n$y=3(2)^2+4(2)-5$\n$y=12+8-5$\n$y=15$\n\nFor x=-4:\n\n$y=3(-4)^2+4(-4)-5$\n$y=48-16-5$\n$y=27$\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points of intersection, we can write the points as (x,y) pairs. In order of increasing x-coordinate, the points of intersection are (-4,27);(2,15)."
