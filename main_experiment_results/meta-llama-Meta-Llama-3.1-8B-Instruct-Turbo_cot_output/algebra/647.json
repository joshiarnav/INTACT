    "problem": "The vertex of the parabola described by the equation $y=-3x^2-30x-81$ is $(m,n)$. What is $n$?",
    "solution": "We will complete the square on the given quadratic expression to find the vertex. Factoring $-3$ from the first two terms, we have \\[y=-3(x^2+10x)-81\\]In order to make the expression inside the parentheses a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(10/2)^2=25$ inside the parentheses. Doing this, we get \\[y=-3(x^2+10x+25-25)-81 = -3(x+5)^2-6\\]The graph of an equation of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ is a parabola with vertex at $(h,k)$, so the vertex of our parabola is at $(-5,-6)$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{-6}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the vertex of the parabola given by $y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. The standard form of a parabola equation is $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola. We need to rewrite the given equation in this form.\n\n2. The equation $y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81$ is a quadratic equation in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a = -3$, $b = -30$, and $c = -81$.\n\n3. To find the x-coordinate of the vertex, we use the formula $h = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. Plugging in the values of $a = -3$ and $b = -30$, we get $h = -\\frac{-30}{2(-3)}$.\n\n4. Simplifying the expression, we get $h = -\\frac{-30}{-6} = -5$.\n\n5. Now that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the y-coordinate by plugging in $h$ into the original equation: $y = -3(-5)^2 - 30(-5) - 81$.\n\n6. Simplifying the expression, we get $y = -3(25) + 150 - 81 = -75 + 150 - 81$.\n\n7. Combining the terms, we get $y = -6$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $n$ is $-6$."
