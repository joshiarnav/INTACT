    "problem": "If a rectangular prism has a length of $l$, a width of $w$, and a height of $h$, then the length of its diagonal is equal to $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}$. Suppose $l = 3$ and $h = 12$; if the length of the diagonal is $13$, what is the width?",
    "solution": "We are given that $$\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + w^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{153 + w^2} = 13.$$Squaring both sides, it follows that $$153 + w^2 = 13^2 = 169 \\quad\\Longrightarrow \\quad w = \\pm 4.$$Since the width must be a positive quantity, the answer is $\\boxed{4}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the width, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Given the formula for the length of the diagonal: $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}$\n2. Given the length of the diagonal: 13\n3. Given the length and height of the prism: $l = 3$ and $h = 12$\n4. Substitute the given values into the formula: $\\sqrt{3^2 + w^2 + 12^2}$\n5. Simplify the equation: $\\sqrt{9 + w^2 + 144}$\n6. Combine the constants: $\\sqrt{w^2 + 153}$\n7. Since the length of the diagonal is 13, we can set up the equation: $\\sqrt{w^2 + 153} = 13$\n8. To solve for $w$, square both sides of the equation: $w^2 + 153 = 169$\n9. Subtract 153 from both sides: $w^2 = 16$\n10. Take the square root of both sides: $w = \\pm 4$\n11. Since the width cannot be negative, the width is 4.\n\nSo, the width of the rectangular prism is 4."
