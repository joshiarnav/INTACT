    "problem": "Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles. If it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles, using the same rates, how many minutes would it take Jordan to run 5 miles?",
    "solution": "Since Steve's 3-mile time is 24 minutes, Jordan ran 2 miles in $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot24=12$ minutes.  Therefore, each mile takes Jordan 6 minutes to run, so he would take $6\\cdot5=\\boxed{30}$ minutes to run five miles.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\nStep 1: Find the time it took Jordan to run 2 miles.\nSince it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles and Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles, \nwe need to first find the time it took Steve to run 3 miles. \n\nTime for Steve to run 3 miles = 24 minutes (given)\n\nNow, we know that the time for Jordan to run 2 miles is half the time for Steve to run 3 miles. \nTime for Jordan to run 2 miles = 24 minutes / 2 = 12 minutes.\n\nStep 2: Find Jordan's rate of running in miles per minute.\nSince Jordan ran 2 miles in 12 minutes, \nwe can find his rate as follows:\nRate = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 12 minutes = 1/6 miles per minute.\n\nStep 3: Find the time it would take Jordan to run 5 miles at the same rate.\nWe know Jordan's rate of running is 1/6 miles per minute. \nTo find the time it takes him to run 5 miles, we can multiply the distance by the rate:\nTime = Distance / Rate = 5 miles / (1/6 miles/minute) = 5 miles * 6 minutes/mile = 30 minutes.\n\nSo using the same rates, it would take Jordan 30 minutes to run 5 miles."
