    "problem": "Anton has two species of ants, Species A and Species B, in his ant farm. The two species are identical in appearance, but Anton knows that every day, there are twice as many ants of Species A than before, while there are three times as many ants of Species B. On Day 0, Anton counts that there are 30 ants in his ant farm. On Day 5, Anton counts that there are 3281 ants in his ant farm. How many of these are of Species A?",
    "solution": "Suppose that there are $a$ ants of Species A and $b$ ants of Species B on Day 0. We thus have that $a+b=30$. Notice that on Day 1, there will be $2a$ ants of Species A, on Day 2, there will be $2(2a) = 4a$ ants of Species A, and on Day 3, there will be $2(4a)=8a$ ants of Species A, etc. Following this line of reasoning, on Day 5, there will be $2^5a$ ants of Species A and $3^5b$ ants of Species B, meaning that $32a+243b=3281$. We now solve this system of linear equations. We have that $32a+32b=960$, so \\begin{align*}(32a+243b)-(32a+32b) &= 211b \\\\\n&= 3281-960 \\\\\n&= 2321.\\end{align*}We then have $b = \\frac{2321}{211} = 11$. This means that $a=30-11=19$, and there are $32\\cdot 19 = \\boxed{608}$ ants of Species A on Day 5.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the growth rates of Species A and Species B:**\n   - Species A doubles every day.\n   - Species B triples every day.\n\n2. **Represent the number of ants of each species on Day 0:**\n   Let's say the number of ants of Species A on Day 0 is A, and the number of ants of Species B on Day 0 is B.\n\n   We know that A + B = 30 (since the total number of ants on Day 0 is 30).\n\n3. **Find the number of ants of each species on Day 5:**\n   - Since Species A doubles every day, after 5 days, the number of ants will be 2^5 * A = 32A.\n   - Since Species B triples every day, after 5 days, the number of ants will be 3^5 * B = 243B.\n\n   We know that on Day 5, the total number of ants is 3281, so 32A + 243B = 3281.\n\n4. **Solve the system of equations:**\n   We have two equations:\n   1. A + B = 30\n   2. 32A + 243B = 3281\n\n   We can solve for A and B by using substitution or elimination.\n\n   Let's use substitution. From the first equation, we can write B = 30 - A.\n\n   Substituting B in the second equation, we get:\n   32A + 243(30 - A) = 3281\n\n   Expanding and solving for A:\n   32A + 7290 - 243A = 3281\n   -211A = -4009\n   A = 19\n\n   Now that we have A, we can find B:\n   B = 30 - A = 30 - 19 = 11\n\n5. **Find the number of ants of Species A on Day 5:**\n   Since we know that A = 19, and the number of ants of Species A on Day 5 is 32A, we can calculate:\n   32A = 32 * 19 = 608\n\nSo, on Day 5, there are 608 ants of Species A."
