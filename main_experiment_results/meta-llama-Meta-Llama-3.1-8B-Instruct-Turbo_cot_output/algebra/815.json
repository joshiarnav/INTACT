    "problem": "The product of two positive integers plus their sum is 103. The integers are relatively prime, and each is less than 20. What is the sum of the two integers?",
    "solution": "Let our numbers be $a$ and $b$ with $a>b.$ Then $ab+a+b=103$. With Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick in mind, we add $1$ to both sides and get $ab+a+b+1 = 104$, which factors as $(a+1)(b+1)=104$. We consider pairs $(a+1, b+1)$ of factors of $104$: $(104,1), (52,2), (26,4), (13,8)$. Since $a<20$, we can rule out the first 3 pairs, which gives $a=12$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\\boxed{19}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nWe are given that the product of two positive integers plus their sum is 103. We can write this as:\n\nxy + x + y = 103\n\nWe are also given that the integers are relatively prime and each is less than 20. \n\nFirst, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick to rewrite the equation:\n\nxy + x + y = 103\nxy + x + y + 1 = 104\n\nNow, we can factor the left-hand side:\n\n(x + 1)(y + 1) = 104\n\nSince x and y are relatively prime, x + 1 and y + 1 must also be relatively prime. \n\nNow, we need to find the pairs of factors of 104 that are relatively prime. \n\nThe factors of 104 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 26, 52, and 104.\n\nThe possible pairs of factors that are relatively prime are: (1, 104), (2, 52), (4, 26), and (8, 13).\n\nSince x + 1 and y + 1 are both less than 21 (because x and y are both less than 20), we can ignore the pairs (1, 104) and (2, 52).\n\nNow, we need to find the pairs (x + 1, y + 1) from the remaining pairs:\n\n- (4, 26) -> x + 1 = 4, y + 1 = 26 -> x = 3, y = 25 (not valid because 25 is not less than 20)\n- (8, 13) -> x + 1 = 8, y + 1 = 13 -> x = 7, y = 12 (valid)\n\nWe have found one valid solution: x = 7 and y = 12.\n\nNow, we can find the sum of x and y: 7 + 12 = 19.\n\nSo, the sum of the two integers is 19."
