    "solution": "The number of squares in the rectangles is an arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference 1. Thus, at Stage 6, there will be 6 squares. Since each square has an area of $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ square inches, the total area of the rectangle at Stage 6 is $6 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{54}$ square inches.",

    "model_solution": "At Stage 1, we have 1 square with an area of 9 square inches.\n\nAt Stage 2, we have 2 squares, so the total area is 2 * 9 = 18 square inches.\n\nAt Stage 3, we have 3 squares, so the total area is 3 * 9 = 27 square inches.\n\nAt Stage 4, we have 4 squares, so the total area is 4 * 9 = 36 square inches.\n\nAt Stage 5, we have 5 squares, so the total area is 5 * 9 = 45 square inches.\n\nAt Stage 6, we have 6 squares, so the total area is 6 * 9 = 54 square inches.\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle at Stage 6 is 54 square inches."
