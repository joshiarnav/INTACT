    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the first six terms in the given geometric sequence, we'll use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence: \n\nS_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nwhere:\n- S_n is the sum of the first n terms\n- a is the first term (in this case, a = 1/2)\n- r is the common ratio between consecutive terms (in this case, r = 1/2)\n- n is the number of terms (in this case, n = 6)\n\nNow, let's substitute the given values into the formula:\n\nS_6 = (1/2) * (1 - (1/2)^6) / (1 - 1/2)\n\nFirst, let's simplify the denominator and the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n(1/2)^6 = 1/64\n\nNow, let's substitute the simplified expressions back into the formula:\n\nS_6 = (1/2) * (1 - 1/64) / (1/2)\n\nTo simplify the expression 1 - 1/64, we can find a common denominator:\n\n1 = 64/64\n\nSo, 1 - 1/64 can be rewritten as:\n\n1 - 1/64 = 64/64 - 1/64 = 63/64\n\nNow, let's substitute the simplified expression back into the formula:\n\nS_6 = (1/2) * (63/64) / (1/2)\n\nTo simplify the expression, we can multiply the numerators and denominators:\n\nS_6 = (1/2) * (63/64) * (2/1)\n\nTo simplify the expression further, we can cancel out the common factors:\n\nS_6 = 63/64"
