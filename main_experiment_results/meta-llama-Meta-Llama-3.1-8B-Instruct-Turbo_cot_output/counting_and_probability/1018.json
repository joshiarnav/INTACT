    "model_solution": "To find the probability of getting heads exactly 8 times out of 10 flips, we'll break it down into steps.\n\n**Step 1: Choose the 8 successful flips**\nWe need to choose 8 out of 10 flips to be heads. This is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (total flips) and r = 8 (successful flips). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nnCr = 10! / (8!(10-8)!)\n= 10! / (8!2!)\n= (10 \u00d7 9) / (2 \u00d7 1)\n= 45\n\nThere are 45 ways to choose 8 successful flips out of 10.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the probability of each successful flip**\nThe probability of getting heads on a single flip is 1/2, since it's a fair coin.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probability of failure for the 2 unsuccessful flips**\nThe probability of getting tails on a single flip is also 1/2.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the probability of each of the 45 combinations**\nSince the probability of each successful flip is 1/2 and the probability of each failure is 1/2, the probability of each combination is:\n\n(1/2)^8 \u00d7 (1/2)^2\n= (1/2)^10\n= 1/1024\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total probability**\nSince there are 45 ways to choose 8 successful flips, we multiply the probability of each combination by 45:\n\n45 \u00d7 1/1024\n= 45/1024\n\nSo, the probability of getting heads exactly 8 times out of 10 flips is 45/1024, or approximately 0.0439."
