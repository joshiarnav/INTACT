    "problem": "Bob rolls a fair six-sided die each morning. If Bob rolls a composite number, he eats sweetened cereal. If he rolls a prime number, he eats unsweetened cereal. If he rolls a 1, then he rolls again. In a non-leap year, what is the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal?

    "solution": "Bob is equally likely to end up rolling a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Three of these numbers are prime and two are composite, so there is a $\\frac{3}{5}$ chance he will eat unsweetened cereal and a $\\frac{2}{5}$ chance that he will eat sweetened cereal. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, so the expected value of the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal is $\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot365=219$ and the expected value of the number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal is $\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot365=146$. The difference between 219 days and 146 days is $\\boxed{73}$ days.",

    "model_solution": "To find the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal in a non-leap year, we first need to determine the probability of each type of cereal Bob eats.\n\n1. **Probability of Eating Unsweetened Cereal:**\n   - Prime numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 3, and 5. \n   - The probability of rolling a prime number is 3/5.\n\n2. **Probability of Eating Sweetened Cereal:**\n   - Composite numbers on a six-sided die are 4 and 6. \n   - The probability of rolling a composite number is 2/5.\n\nNow, let's consider the total number of days in a non-leap year.\n\n- A non-leap year has 365 days.\n\nUsing the probabilities calculated above, we can find the expected number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the expected number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal.\n\n1. **Expected Number of Days Bob Eats Unsweetened Cereal:**\n   - Expected number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal = Total number of days * Probability of Eating Unsweetened Cereal\n   - Expected number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal = 365 * (3/5)\n   - Expected number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal = 219\n\n2. **Expected Number of Days Bob Eats Sweetened Cereal:**\n   - Expected number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal = Total number of days * Probability of Eating Sweetened Cereal\n   - Expected number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal = 365 * (2/5)\n   - Expected number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal = 146\n\nNow, to find the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal, we subtract the expected number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal from the expected number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal.\n\n- Expected value of the difference = Expected number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal - Expected number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal\n- Expected value of the difference = 219 - 146\n- Expected value of the difference = 73\n\nTherefore, the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal in a non-leap year is 73."
