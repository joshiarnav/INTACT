    "problem": "Two standard dice are rolled. What is the expected number of 1's obtained? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability of rolling a number other than 1 on one die is $\\frac{5}{6}$, so the probability of rolling zero 1's on two dice is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{36}$. The probability of rolling a 1 on one die is $\\frac{1}{6}$, so the probability of rolling 1's on two dice (for a total of two 1's) is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{36}$. Since the only other possibility is rolling exactly one 1, the probability of rolling one 1 is $1-\\frac{25}{36}-\\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{10}{36}$. We find the expected number of 1's to be $E = \\frac{1}{36} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{10}{36} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{25}{36} \\cdot 0 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the expected number of 1's obtained when two standard dice are rolled, we need to consider the probability of getting 1's on each die and then calculate the average number of 1's.\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n\n1. Rolling zero 1's: In this case, neither of the two dice shows a 1.\n2. Rolling one 1: This can occur in two ways: either the first die shows a 1 and the second die does not, or the first die does not show a 1 and the second die does.\n3. Rolling two 1's: In this case, both dice show a 1.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities and the expected number of 1's.\n\n1. Probability of rolling zero 1's:\n   - The first die can be any number from 2 to 6 (5 possibilities).\n   - Since the second die also has 5 possibilities (2 to 6), the total number of ways to get zero 1's is 5 \u00d7 5 = 25.\n   - The total number of possible outcomes is 6 \u00d7 6 = 36 (since each die has 6 possible outcomes).\n   - So, the probability of rolling zero 1's is 25/36.\n\n2. Probability of rolling one 1:\n   - The first die shows a 1 (1 possibility) and the second die does not (5 possibilities): 1 \u00d7 5 = 5 ways.\n   - The first die does not show a 1 (5 possibilities) and the second die shows a 1 (1 possibility): 5 \u00d7 1 = 5 ways.\n   - So, the total number of ways to roll one 1 is 5 + 5 = 10.\n   - The probability of rolling one 1 is 10/36, which simplifies to 5/18.\n\n3. Probability of rolling two 1's:\n   - Both dice show a 1 (1 possibility).\n   - The probability of rolling two 1's is 1/36.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected number of 1's.\n\nExpected number of 1's = (Probability of rolling zero 1's) \u00d7 (Number of 1's in this case) + (Probability of rolling one 1) \u00d7 (Number of 1's in this case) + (Probability of rolling two 1's) \u00d7 (Number of 1's in this case)\n= (25/36) \u00d7 0 + (5/18) \u00d7 1 + (1/36) \u00d7 2\n= 0 + 5/18 + 1/18\n= 6/18\n= 1/3\n\nSo, the expected number of 1's obtained when two standard dice are rolled is 1/3."
