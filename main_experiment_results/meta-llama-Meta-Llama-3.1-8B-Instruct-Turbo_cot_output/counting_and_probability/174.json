    "problem": "How many three-digit numbers are multiples of neither 5 nor 7?",
    "solution": "It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 5 or 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \\times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 that is a three-digit number is $142 \\times 7 = 994$.  Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7.  The smallest multiple of 5 that is a three-digit number is $20\\times 5 = 100$, and the largest multiple of 5 that is a three digit number is $199\\times 5 =995$. So there are $199-20+1=180$ multiples of 5.\n\nNow notice that we have counted some numbers twice: those multiples of $5\\times7=35$. The smallest multiple of 35 is $3\\times 35 = 105$, the largest multiple of 35 is $28\\times35 =980$. So there are $28-3+1=26$ multiples of 35.\n\nWe have 128 multiples of 7 and 180 multiples of 5, but we count 26 multiples twice.  So, there are a total of $128+180-26 = 282$ distinct three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 (or both).   There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-282=\\boxed{618}$ three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7 nor 5.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, we'll break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Find the total number of three-digit numbers.\nThe smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999. So, the total number of three-digit numbers is 999 - 100 + 1 = 900.\n\nStep 2: Find the number of three-digit multiples of 5.\nThe smallest three-digit multiple of 5 is 100, and the largest is 995. To find the number of multiples of 5, we'll divide the largest by 5 and add 1 (to include both ends). 995 / 5 = 199, so there are 199 multiples of 5.\n\nStep 3: Find the number of three-digit multiples of 7.\nThe smallest three-digit multiple of 7 is 105, and the largest is 994. To find the number of multiples of 7, we'll divide the largest by 7 and add 1. 994 / 7 = 142, so there are 142 multiples of 7.\n\nStep 4: Find the number of three-digit multiples of both 5 and 7 (35).\nThe smallest three-digit multiple of 35 is 105, and the largest is 980. To find the number of multiples of 35, we'll divide the largest by 35 and add 1. 980 / 35 = 28, so there are 28 multiples of 35.\n\nStep 5: Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\nThe total number of multiples of 5 or 7 (or both) is the sum of multiples of 5 and multiples of 7 minus the number of multiples of both (to avoid double counting). So, the total number is 199 + 142 - 28 = 313.\n\nStep 6: Subtract the total number of multiples of 5 or 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers.\nTo find the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, we'll subtract the total multiples of 5 or 7 from the total number of three-digit numbers. 900 - 313 = 587.\n\nSo, there are 587 three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7."
