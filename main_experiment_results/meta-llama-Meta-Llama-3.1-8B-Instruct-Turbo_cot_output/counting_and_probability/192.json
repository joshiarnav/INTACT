    "solution": "Let $\\ell$ be the perpendicular bisector of segment $AC$.  We note that the points that are closer to $A$ than they are to $C$ are the points that are on the same side of $\\ell$ as $A$.

Since it passes through the midpoint of $AC$, it also passes through the midpoint of $AB$, which we'll call $D$.\n\nLet $m$ be the perpendicular bisector of segment $BC$.

There are a few different ways to see that this ratio is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.  One way is to note that we can divide $ABC$ into 4 congruent triangles, 2 of which are shaded: [asy]\ndefaultpen(1);\n\npair C=(0,0), A=(0,3), B=(4,0);\n\npair D = (A+B)/2;\npair E = (C+A)/2;\npair F = (B+C)/2;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nfill(D--F--C--E--cycle,gray(.7));\n\ndraw(E--D--F);\ndraw(C--D);\n\nlabel(\"\\(A\\)\",A,N);\nlabel(\"\\(B\\)\",B,(1,0));\nlabel(\"\\(C\\)\",C,SW);\n\nlabel(\"\\(D\\)\",D,NE);\n[/asy] Another way is to notice that the rectangle's sides have length $\\frac{3}{2}$ and $\\frac{4}{2}$, so that the rectangle's area is $\\frac{3 \\cdot 4}{2 \\cdot 2}$.  Since triangle $ABC$'s area is $\\frac{3 \\cdot 4}{2}$, it follows that the probability we seek is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$, as before.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the points within triangle ABC that are closer to C than to either A or B.\n\nStep 1: First, let's understand the points that are closer to C than to A. These are the points on the side AC, because the perpendicular bisector of AC will split the triangle into two regions: one closer to A and one closer to C. \n\nStep 2: Next, we need to determine the points that are closer to C than to B. Similarly, the perpendicular bisector of BC will split the triangle into two regions: one closer to B and one closer to C.\n\nStep 3: When we draw the perpendicular bisectors of AC and BC, we can see that the points that are closer to C than to either A or B lie within the shaded region.\n\nStep 4: We can see that the perpendicular bisectors of AC and BC intersect at the midpoint of AB, and the shaded region is a rectangle with a base of 1.5 and a height of 1.5, since it is bounded by the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle.\n\nStep 5: The total area of the triangle ABC is 6 (found using Heron's formula). The area of the shaded region is (1.5)(1.5) = 2.25.\n\nStep 6: To find the probability that P is closer to C than it is to either A or B, we need to divide the area of the shaded region by the area of the triangle ABC.\n\nStep 7: The probability is then 2.25/6 = 3/8.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$"
