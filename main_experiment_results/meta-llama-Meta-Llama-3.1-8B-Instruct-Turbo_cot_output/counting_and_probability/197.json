    "problem": "A pirate is searching for buried treasure on 6 islands. On each island, there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that the island has buried treasure and no traps, a $\\frac{1}{12}$ chance that the island has traps but no treasure, and a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance that the island has neither traps nor treasure. What is the probability that while searching all 6 islands, the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure, and none with traps?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose 3 islands. For each of these choices, there is a probability of $\\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3$ that the chosen islands have treasure and the remaining ones have neither treasure nor traps. Therefore, the probability that the pirate encounters exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps is $20 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps, we need to consider the possible combinations of islands that meet this condition.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the probability of each island having the desired outcome:\n\n- The probability of an island having treasure and no traps is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n- The probability of an island having neither traps nor treasure is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nSince we want exactly 3 islands with treasure and 3 islands with neither traps nor treasure, we can use the binomial coefficient to calculate the number of possible combinations:\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 islands out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\n$C(6, 3) = \\frac{6!}{3! \\cdot 3!} = 20$\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of each combination:\n\n- The probability of 3 islands having treasure is $(\\frac{1}{4})^3$.\n- The probability of 3 islands having neither traps nor treasure is $(\\frac{2}{3})^3$.\n\nThe probability of each combination is:\n\n$(\\frac{1}{4})^3 \\cdot (\\frac{2}{3})^3 = \\frac{1}{64} \\cdot \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{1}{216}$\n\nSince there are 20 possible combinations, the total probability is:\n\n$20 \\cdot \\frac{1}{216} = \\frac{20}{216} = \\frac{5}{54}$\n\nSo, the probability that the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps is $\\frac{5}{54}$."
