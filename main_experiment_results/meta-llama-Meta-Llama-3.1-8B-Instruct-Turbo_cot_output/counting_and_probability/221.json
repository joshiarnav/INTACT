    "solution": "Since $12! = 12 \\cdot 11!$, we can examine the sum better by factoring $11!$ out of both parts: $$ 11! + 12! = 11! + 12 \\cdot 11! = 11!(1 + 12) = 11! \\cdot 13. $$Since no prime greater than 11 divides $11!$, $\\boxed{13}$ is the largest prime factor of $11! + 12!$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest prime divisor of 11! + 12!, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the expression:**\n   The expression 11! + 12! can be expanded as:\n\n   11! = 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1\n   12! = 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1\n\n2. **Factor out the common terms:**\n   We can rewrite 12! as 12 \u00d7 11! which includes all the terms of 11!.\n\n   11! + 12! = 11! + 12 \u00d7 11!\n\n   Now, we can factor out 11! from both terms:\n\n   11! + 12 \u00d7 11! = 11!(1 + 12)\n\n   This simplifies to:\n\n   11!(1 + 12) = 11! \u00d7 13\n\n3. **Determine the prime factorization:**\n   We now know that 11! + 12! can be factored as 11! \u00d7 13. \n\n   Since 11! is the product of all numbers from 1 to 11, and 13 is a prime number, the prime factorization of 11! + 12! will include all prime factors present in 11! and the prime number 13.\n\n   However, 13 will be the largest prime factor since it is greater than any of the prime factors present in 11!.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The largest prime divisor of 11! + 12! is 13."
