    "solution": "We note that the points for which $x+y<3$ are those that lie below the line $x+y = 3$, or $y= -x + 3$.  As the diagram below illustrates, these are all the points in the square except those in the triangle with vertices (2,1), (2,2), and (1,2).\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(.7);\n\ndraw((-.1,0)--(3,0),Arrow);\ndraw((0,-.1)--(0,4),Arrow);\n\ndraw((0,2)--(2,2)--(2,0));\ndraw((-.5,3.5)--(2.5,.5),dashed,Arrows);\n\nfill((0,0)--(0,2)--(1,2)--(2,1)--(2,0)--cycle,gray(.7));\n\nlabel(\"(1,2)\",(1,2),NE);\nlabel(\"(2,2)\",(2,2),NE);\nlabel(\"(2,1)\",(2,1),NE);\n[/asy]\n\nSince this is a right triangle whose sides both of length 1, its area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1^2 = 1/2$.

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that $x+y < 3$, we need to understand the geometry of the problem.\n\nThe given square has vertices at (0,0), (0,2), (2,2), and (2,0). This means the side length of the square is 2 units.\n\nThe line $x+y=3$ passes through the points (3,0) and (0,3). Since we're working within the square, we're only concerned with the portion of the line within the square. \n\nWithin the square, the line $x+y=3$ intersects the square at the points (1,2) and (2,1).\n\nNow, let's visualize the region where $x+y < 3$. This inequality represents the area below the line $x+y=3$. We can see that this area includes the entire square except the triangle formed by the points (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2).\n\nThe area of the square is $2^2 = 4$ square units. The area of the triangle can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height. \n\nIn this case, the base of the triangle is 1 unit (from (1,2) to (2,2)), and the height is 1 unit (from (2,1) to (2,2)). \n\nSo, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ square units.\n\nThe area where $x+y < 3$ is the area of the square minus the area of the triangle, which is $4 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}$ square units.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that $x+y < 3$ by dividing the area where $x+y < 3$ by the total area of the square:\n\nProbability = Area where $x+y < 3$ / Total area of the square\n= $\\frac{7}{2} / 4$\n= $\\frac{7}{8}$\n\nSo, the probability that $x+y < 3$ is $\\frac{7}{8}$."
