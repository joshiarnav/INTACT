    "problem": "William is taking the 25-question, multiple choice American Mathematics Competition. Each question has five answer choices. William guesses random answers for the last four questions. What is the probability that he will get at least one of these final four questions right?",
    "solution": "We find the probability that William misses the last four questions, and subtract from 1. The probability of William missing a question is $\\frac{4}{5}$, so the probability that he misses all four is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = \\frac{256}{625}$. The probability that he gets at least one right is $1-\\frac{256}{625} =\\boxed{\\frac{369}{625}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that William will get at least one of the final four questions right, let's first find the probability that he will get all of them wrong. \n\nFor each question, there are 5 answer choices and only 1 correct answer. So, the probability of getting a question wrong is 4/5.\n\nSince the questions are independent of each other, we can multiply the probabilities of getting each question wrong:\n\nProbability of getting the 1st question wrong = 4/5\nProbability of getting the 2nd question wrong = 4/5\nProbability of getting the 3rd question wrong = 4/5\nProbability of getting the 4th question wrong = 4/5\n\nThe probability of getting all 4 questions wrong is:\n\n(4/5) \u00d7 (4/5) \u00d7 (4/5) \u00d7 (4/5) = (4/5)^4\n\nNow, to find the probability that William will get at least one of these final four questions right, we subtract the probability that he will get all of them wrong from 1:\n\nProbability of getting at least one question right = 1 - (4/5)^4\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n(4/5)^4 = 256/625\n1 - (256/625) = 369/625\n\nSo, the probability that William will get at least one of the final four questions right is 369/625."
