    "problem": "How many positive multiples of $7$ that are less than $1000$ end with the digit $3$?",
    "solution": "Listing the first 10 multiples of 7, which are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, we see that the only positive multiples of 7 that end in 3 are those that are the product of 7 and a number that ends in 9.  Therefore, the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3 are $7\\cdot 9 = 63$, $7\\cdot 19= 133$, $7\\cdot 29 = 203$, . . .  Notice that we can get from each to the next by adding $7\\cdot 10 = 70$, so our multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 are 63, 133, 203, . . ., 903, 973.  The last one is 910 more than the first. Since $910/70=13$, we see that we have taken 13 steps of 70 to get from the first number in the list to the last. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{14}$ numbers in the list.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the positive multiples of 7 that end with the digit 3 and are less than 1000.\n\nStep 1: First, let's find the pattern for multiples of 7 that end with 3. Since 7 is not divisible by 10, we can't directly multiply 7 with 10 to get the number ending with 3. However, we can list the first few multiples of 7 that end with 3 to identify the pattern.\n\nStep 2: Multiples of 7 that end with the digit 3 are: 7, 21, 35, 49, 63, 77, 91, 105, 119, 133, 147, 161, 175, 189, 203, 217, 231, 245, 259, 273, 287, 301, 315, 329, 343, 357, 371, 385, 399, 413, 427, 441, 455, 469, 483, 497, 511, 525, 539, 553, 567, 581, 595, 609, 623, 637, 651, 665, 679, 693, 707, 721, 735, 749, 763, 777, 791, 805, 819, 833, 847, 861, 875, 889, 903, 917, 931, 945, 959, 973, 987.\n\nStep 3: We can observe that these numbers are obtained by adding 14 to the previous number and then appending 3. For example, 21 + 14 = 35 and 35 + 14 = 49. The first multiple of 7 that ends with the digit 3 is 7 itself.\n\nStep 4: Now let's find out how many multiples of 7 that end with the digit 3 are there less than 1000. We can observe that up to 987, we have 70 such numbers. Since 1000 is even and we are looking for less than 1000, we can say there are 70 numbers.\n\nHowever, we should be careful as 1000 is not included and we are only interested in the less than 1000.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the number of positive multiples of 7 that end with the digit 3 and are less than 1000 is 70."
