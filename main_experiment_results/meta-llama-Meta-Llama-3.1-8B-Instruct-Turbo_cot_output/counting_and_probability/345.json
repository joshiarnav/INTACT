    "problem": "If two distinct numbers are selected at random from the first seven prime numbers, what is the probability that their sum is an even number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2. There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum IS even is $1-\\frac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers is even, we need to consider the possible combinations and their total count.\n\nThe first seven prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\nTo have an even sum, we can either select two even numbers or two odd numbers. \n\nSince there is only one even prime number (2), we cannot select two distinct even numbers from the given prime numbers.\n\nHowever, we can select two distinct odd numbers. The other six prime numbers are odd: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\nTo find the number of ways to select two distinct odd numbers from the six available, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n\nHere, n = 6 (the number of odd prime numbers) and r = 2 (the number of selections).\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!)\n= (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1) * (4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n= (6 * 5) / (2 * 1)\n= 15\n\nThere are 15 ways to select two distinct odd numbers from the six available odd prime numbers.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of ways to select two distinct prime numbers from the seven available prime numbers:\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7-2)!)\n= (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n= (7 * 6) / (2 * 1)\n= 21\n\nThere are 21 ways to select two distinct prime numbers from the seven available prime numbers.\n\nThe probability that the sum of two distinct numbers is even is the number of ways to select two distinct odd numbers divided by the total number of ways to select two distinct prime numbers:\n\nProbability = Number of ways to select two distinct odd numbers / Total number of ways to select two distinct prime numbers\n= 15 / 21\n= 5 / 7\n\nSo, the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers is even is 5/7."
