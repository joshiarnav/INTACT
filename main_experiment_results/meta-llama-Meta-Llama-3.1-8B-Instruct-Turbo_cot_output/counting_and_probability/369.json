    "problem": "A Senate committee has 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats.  In how many ways can we form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats?",
    "solution": "There are 8 Republicans and 3 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ ways to choose the Republicans.  There are 6 Democrats and 2 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose the Democrats.  So there are $56 \\times 15 = \\boxed{840}$ ways to choose the subcommittee.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Choose 3 Republicans from 8 Republicans.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8 Republicans can be calculated using combinations, denoted as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\". This is calculated as:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nHere, n = 8 (total number of Republicans) and k = 3 (number of Republicans to choose).\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n= 8! / (3!5!)\n= (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n= 56\n\nSo, there are 56 ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8 Republicans.\n\nStep 2: Choose 2 Democrats from 6 Democrats.\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the number of ways to choose 2 Democrats from 6 Democrats using combinations:\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!)\n= 6! / (2!4!)\n= (6 * 5) / (2 * 1)\n= 15\n\nSo, there are 15 ways to choose 2 Democrats from 6 Democrats.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of ways to form the subcommittee.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to form the subcommittee, we multiply the number of ways to choose the Republicans by the number of ways to choose the Democrats:\n\nTotal number of ways = C(8, 3) * C(6, 2)\n= 56 * 15\n= 840\n\nTherefore, there are 840 ways to form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats from a Senate committee with 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats."
