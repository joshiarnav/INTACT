    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable but the boxes are?",
    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of balls in the different boxes.\n\nThere are $3$ ways to arrange the balls as $(5,0,0)$ (specifically, box 1 can have 5, box 2 can have 5, box 3 can have 5).\n\nThere are $3! = 6$ to arrange $(4,1,0)$ and $3! = 6$ ways to arrange $(3,2,0)$; in each case, we must choose one of the 3 boxes to have the largest number of balls, and also one of the remaining two boxes to be left empty.\n\nHowever, there are only $3$ ways to arrange $(3,1,1)$, and $3$ ways to arrange $(2,2,1)$; in each case, we must choose one box to have the `different' number of balls (3 in the $(3,1,1)$ case and 1 in the $(2,2,1)$ case).\n\nThis gives a total of $3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = \\boxed{21}$ arrangements.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of ways to put 5 indistinguishable balls in 3 distinguishable boxes, we can break down the problem into steps.\n\n1. **First Ball**: The first ball has 3 options - it can go in any of the 3 boxes. \n\n2. **Second Ball**: The second ball also has 3 options, it can go in any of the 3 boxes, regardless of where the first ball is.\n\n3. **Third Ball**: Similarly, the third ball has 3 options - it can go in any of the 3 boxes.\n\n4. **Fourth Ball**: The fourth ball again has 3 options.\n\n5. **Fifth Ball**: The fifth ball also has 3 options.\n\nHowever, we need to be careful here.  We can't simply multiply the options (3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3) because the balls are indistinguishable. We are essentially counting each arrangement multiple times - for example, the arrangement (1 ball in box 1, 2 balls in box 2, 2 balls in box 3) is the same as (2 balls in box 1, 1 ball in box 2, 2 balls in box 3), but these are both counted as different arrangements when we multiply the options.\n\nA better way to solve this problem is to use the concept of \"stars and bars\". We can represent the balls as stars and the boxes as bars. For example, if we have 5 stars and 2 bars, then the possible arrangements are:\n\n* 5 stars in a row (all 5 balls in box 1)\n* 4 stars in a row followed by 1 star (4 balls in box 1, 1 ball in box 2)\n* 3 stars in a row followed by 2 stars (3 balls in box 1, 2 balls in box 2)\n* 3 stars in a row followed by 1 star and 1 bar (3 balls in box 1, 1 ball in box 2, 1 ball in box 3)\n* and so on...\n\nWe can count the number of stars and bars as follows: We have 5 stars (the 5 balls) and 2 bars (to separate the 3 boxes). We can choose the positions of the bars in 5+2-1 = 6 ways (we subtract 1 because we can't have a bar at both ends). \n\nHowever, these 6 ways don't necessarily give us all the possible arrangements. For example, the arrangement (4 balls in box 1, 1 ball in box 2) is represented as 4 stars followed by 1 bar, but we can also represent it as 4 bars followed by 1 star (because the 4 stars are in box 1 and the 1 star is in box 2). \n\nTo count all the possible arrangements, we can use the concept of \"integer partitions\". We can represent each arrangement as a partition of the number 5. For example, the arrangement (4 balls in box 1, 1 ball in box 2) can be represented as the partition 4+1, and the arrangement (3 balls in box 1, 2 balls in box 2) can be represented as the partition 3+2.\n\nWe can count the number of partitions of the number 5 as follows:\n\n1. The number 5 itself (all 5 balls in box 1)\n2. 4+1 (4 balls in box 1, 1 ball in box 2)\n3. 3+2 (3 balls in box 1, 2 balls in box 2)\n4. 3+1+1 (3 balls in box 1, 1 ball in box 2, 1 ball in box 3)\n5. 2+2+1 (2 balls in box 1, 2 balls in box 2, 1 ball in box 3)\n6. 2+1+1+1 (2 balls in box 1, 1 ball in box 2, 1 ball in box 3, 1 ball in box 3)\n\nWe can see that there are 6 possible partitions of the number 5.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 ways to put 5 indistinguishable balls in 3 distinguishable boxes."
