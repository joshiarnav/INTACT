    "solution": "The number of pairs of neighbors for Cara actually has nothing to do with the shape of the table she is sitting at. That is, all that matters is that she has 5 friends and two of them will be her neighbors. There are ${5 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{10}$ pairs of friends that she can thus sit between.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of possible pairs of people that Cara could be sitting between, we need to consider the number of choices for the person on her left and the person on her right.\n\nStep 1: Choosing the person on the left\nThere are 5 friends that could be sitting to the left of Cara. \n\nStep 2: Choosing the person on the right\nOnce we choose the person on the left, there are 4 remaining friends that could be sitting to the right of Cara.\n\nStep 3: Calculating the number of pairs\nTo find the total number of possible pairs of people that Cara could be sitting between, we multiply the number of choices for the person on the left by the number of choices for the person on the right.\n\nTotal pairs = 5 (choices for the left) x 4 (choices for the right) = 20\n\nTherefore, Cara could be sitting between 20 different pairs of people."
