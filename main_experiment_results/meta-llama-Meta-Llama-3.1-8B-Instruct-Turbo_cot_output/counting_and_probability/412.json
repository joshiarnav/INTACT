    "problem": "How many distinct triangles can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube? (Two triangles are distinct if they have different locations in space.)",
    "solution": "There are eight vertices of a cube, and we choose three of these to form a triangle. Thus, the number of distinct triangles that can be formed is $\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8\\cdot7\\cdot6}{3\\cdot2} = \\boxed{56}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of distinct triangles that can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Count the total number of vertices in a cube**: A cube has 8 vertices, as it is a 3-dimensional object with 6 faces, each face being a square with 4 vertices.\n\n2. **Choose 3 vertices from the total**: To form a triangle, we need 3 vertices. We can use the concept of combinations to choose 3 vertices out of the 8 available vertices. The number of ways to choose 3 vertices from 8 is given by the combination formula: C(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!)\n\n   We calculate this using factorials: \n   8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40,320\n   3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n   (8-3)! = 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n\n   So, C(8, 3) = 40,320 / (6 * 120) = 40,320 / 720 = 56\n\nTherefore, there are 56 distinct triangles that can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube."
