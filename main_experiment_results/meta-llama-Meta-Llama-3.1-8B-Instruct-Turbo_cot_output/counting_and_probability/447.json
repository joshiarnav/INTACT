    "problem": "There are 12 different-colored crayons in a box. How many ways can Karl select four crayons if the order in which he draws them out does not matter?",
    "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations.\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem\nKarl has 12 different-colored crayons in a box, and he wants to select 4 of them. The order in which he selects the crayons does not matter.\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of problem\nThis is a combination problem, because the order of selection does not matter.\n\nStep 3: Use the formula for combinations\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of items (12 crayons)\n- r is the number of items to be selected (4 crayons)\n- ! denotes the factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the number of combinations\nUsing the formula, we get:\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4!(12-4)!)\n= 12! / (4!8!)\n= (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)\n= 495\n\nTherefore, Karl can select 4 crayons in 495 ways.\n\nAlternatively, this problem can be approached using the \"n choose r\" or \"n choose k\" formula which is part of a broader class of problems that can be solved using combinations."
