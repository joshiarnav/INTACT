    "problem": "A soccer team has $22$ available players. A fixed set of $11$ players starts the game, while the other $11$ are available as substitutes. During the game, the coach may make as many as $3$ substitutions, where any one of the $11$ players in the game is replaced by one of the substitutes. No player removed from the game may reenter the game, although a substitute entering the game may be replaced later. No two substitutions can happen at the same time. The players involved and the order of the substitutions matter. Let $n$ be the number of ways the coach can make substitutions during the game (including the possibility of making no substitutions). Find the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$.\n",
    "solution": "There are $0-3$ substitutions. The number of ways to sub any number of times must be multiplied by the previous number. This is defined recursively. The case for $0$ subs is $1$, and the ways to reorganize after $n$ subs is the product of the number of new subs ($12-n$) and the players that can be ejected ($11$). The formula for $n$ subs is then $a_n=11(12-n)a_{n-1}$ with $a_0=1$.\nSumming from $0$ to $3$ gives $1+11^2+11^{3}\\cdot 10+11^{4}\\cdot 10\\cdot 9$. Notice that $10+9\\cdot11\\cdot10=10+990=1000$. Then, rearrange it into $1+11^2+11^3\\cdot (10+11\\cdot10\\cdot9)= 1+11^2+11^3\\cdot (1000)$. When taking modulo $1000$, the last term goes away. What is left is $1+11^2=\\boxed{122}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps. \n\nStep 1: No substitutions are made. \nThere is only one way to do this, which is to do nothing.\n\nStep 2: One substitution is made. \nThe coach can choose any of the $11$ players on the field to be substituted, and for each of these players, there are $11$ possible substitutes. So, there are $11 \\times 11 = 121$ ways to make one substitution.\n\nStep 3: Two substitutions are made. \nFor each of the $121$ possible substitutions, the coach can then choose to substitute another player from the $10$ remaining players on the field, and for each of these players, there are $10$ possible substitutes. So, there are $121 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 12100$ ways to make two substitutions.\n\nStep 4: Three substitutions are made. \nFor each of the $12100$ possible substitutions, the coach can then choose to substitute another player from the $9$ remaining players on the field, and for each of these players, there are $9$ possible substitutes. So, there are $12100 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 1029000$ ways to make three substitutions.\n\nStep 5: Add up all the possible ways to make substitutions. \nThe total number of ways to make substitutions is $1 + 121 + 12100 + 1029000 = 1033022$.\n\nStep 6: Find the remainder when $1033022$ is divided by $1000$.\nThe remainder is $22$.\n\nSo, the answer is $22$."
