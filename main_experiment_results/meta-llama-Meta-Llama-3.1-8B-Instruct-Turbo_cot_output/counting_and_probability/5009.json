    "problem": "Let $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ be the vertices of a regular tetrahedron each of whose edges measures 1 meter. A bug, starting from vertex $A$, observes the following rule: at each vertex it chooses one of the three edges meeting at that vertex, each edge being equally likely to be chosen, and crawls along that edge to the vertex at its opposite end. Let $p = \\frac n{729}$ be the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ when it has crawled exactly 7 meters. Find the value of $n$.\n",
    "solution": "Let $P(n)$ denote the probability that the bug is at $A$ after it has crawled $n$ meters. Since the bug can only be at vertex $A$ if it just left a vertex which is not $A$, we have $P(n + 1) = \\frac13 (1 - P(n))$. We also know $P(0) = 1$, so we can quickly compute $P(1)=0$, $P(2) = \\frac 13$, $P(3) = \\frac29$, $P(4) = \\frac7{27}$, $P(5) = \\frac{20}{81}$, $P(6) = \\frac{61}{243}$ and $P(7) = \\frac{182}{729}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{182}$. One can solve this recursion fairly easily to determine a closed-form expression for $P(n)$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nLet $P(n)$ be the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ after crawling $n$ meters. We are given that the bug starts at vertex $A$.\n\nFor the bug to be at vertex $A$ after crawling $n$ meters, it must have just left a vertex which is not $A$.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible vertices that the bug can be at after crawling $n-1$ meters. Let $P(n-1, B)$ be the probability that the bug is at vertex $B$ after crawling $n-1$ meters. Similarly, let $P(n-1, C)$ and $P(n-1, D)$ be the probabilities that the bug is at vertex $C$ and $D$ after crawling $n-1$ meters.\n\nNow, since the bug can only be at one of the vertices after crawling $n-1$ meters, we can write:\n\n$$P(n-1) = P(n-1, B) + P(n-1, C) + P(n-1, D)$$\n\nSince the bug is equally likely to choose any of the three edges at each vertex, and the probability of it being at vertex $A$ after crawling $n-1$ meters is the probability of it being at any other vertex and then crawling to $A$ (which is $\\frac{1}{3}$), we have:\n\n$$P(n) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(n-1))$$\n\nWe can now use this recursive relation to find the values of $P(n)$.\n\nFor $n=1$, the bug can only be at vertex $A$, so $P(1) = 1$.\n\nFor $n=2$, the bug can be at vertex $A$ if it was at any of vertices $B, C$, or $D$ and crawled to $A$, so:\n\n$$P(2) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(1)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - 1) = 0$$\n\nFor $n=3$, the bug can be at vertex $A$ if it was at any of vertices $B, C$, or $D$ and crawled to $A$, so:\n\n$$P(3) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(2)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nFor $n=4$, the bug can be at vertex $A$ if it was at any of vertices $B, C$, or $D$ and crawled to $A$, so:\n\n$$P(4) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(3)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{2}{9}$$\n\nFor $n=5$, the bug can be at vertex $A$ if it was at any of vertices $B, C$, or $D$ and crawled to $A$, so:\n\n$$P(5) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(4)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{9}\\right) = \\frac{7}{27}$$\n\nFor $n=6$, the bug can be at vertex $A$ if it was at any of vertices $B, C$, or $D$ and crawled to $A$, so:\n\n$$P(6) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(5)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{7}{27}\\right) = \\frac{20}{81}$$\n\nFor $n=7$, the bug can be at vertex $A$ if it was at any of vertices $B, C$, or $D$ and crawled to $A$, so:\n\n$$P(7) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (1 - P(6)) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{20}{81}\\right) = \\frac{61}{243}$$\n\nSince $p = \\frac{n}{729}$, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{n}{729} = \\frac{61}{243}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 729, we get:\n\n$$n = \\frac{61}{243} \\cdot 729 = 61 \\cdot 3 = 183$$\n\nHowever, we need to find the number of terms to the right of the decimal point. Since $n = 61 \\cdot 3$, we can express $n$ as:\n\n$$n = 183 \\cdot \\frac{1}{1}$$ \n\nTherefore, we will round down to 183.\n\nThe answer is 183."
