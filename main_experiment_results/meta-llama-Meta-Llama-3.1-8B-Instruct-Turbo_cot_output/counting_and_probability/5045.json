    "problem": "Each of the $2001$ students at a high school studies either Spanish or French, and some study both. The number who study Spanish is between $80$ percent and $85$ percent of the school population, and the number who study French is between $30$ percent and $40$ percent. Let $m$ be the smallest number of students who could study both languages, and let $M$ be the largest number of students who could study both languages. Find $M-m$.\n",
    "solution": "Let $S$ be the percent of people who study Spanish, $F$ be the number of people who study French, and let $S \\cup F$ be the number of students who study both. Then $\\left\\lceil 80\\% \\cdot 2001 \\right\\rceil = 1601 \\le S \\le \\left\\lfloor 85\\% \\cdot 2001 \\right\\rfloor = 1700$, and $\\left\\lceil 30\\% \\cdot 2001 \\right\\rceil = 601 \\le F \\le \\left\\lfloor 40\\% \\cdot 2001 \\right\\rfloor = 800$. By the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion,\n\\[S+F- S \\cap F = S \\cup F = 2001\\]\nFor $m = S \\cap F$ to be smallest, $S$ and $F$ must be minimized.\n\\[1601 + 601 - m = 2001 \\Longrightarrow m = 201\\]\nFor $M = S \\cap F$ to be largest, $S$ and $F$ must be maximized.\n\\[1700 + 800 - M = 2001 \\Longrightarrow M = 499\\]\nTherefore, the answer is $M - m = 499 - 201 = \\boxed{298}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum and maximum number of students studying both Spanish and French. \n\nFirst, let's find the minimum and maximum number of students studying Spanish and French.\n\nThe number of students studying Spanish is between $80\\%$ and $85\\%$ of the school population, which is $2001$ students.\n\nMinimum number of students studying Spanish = $\\lceil 80\\% \\times 2001 \\rceil = \\lceil 1600.8 \\rceil = 1601$\nMaximum number of students studying Spanish = $\\lfloor 85\\% \\times 2001 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1700.85 \\rfloor = 1700$\n\nThe number of students studying French is between $30\\%$ and $40\\%$ of the school population, which is $2001$ students.\n\nMinimum number of students studying French = $\\lceil 30\\% \\times 2001 \\rceil = \\lceil 600.3 \\rceil = 601$\nMaximum number of students studying French = $\\lfloor 40\\% \\times 2001 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 800.4 \\rfloor = 800$\n\nNow, let's find the minimum and maximum number of students studying both languages. \n\nTo find the minimum number of students studying both languages, we need to find the least possible value of the number of students studying both languages. This happens when the number of students studying Spanish is at its minimum and the number of students studying French is at its minimum.\n\nMinimum number of students studying both languages = Minimum number of students studying Spanish + Minimum number of students studying French - Total number of students\n= 1601 + 601 - 2001\n= 201\n\nTo find the maximum number of students studying both languages, we need to find the greatest possible value of the number of students studying both languages. This happens when the number of students studying Spanish is at its maximum and the number of students studying French is at its maximum.\n\nMaximum number of students studying both languages = Maximum number of students studying Spanish + Maximum number of students studying French - Total number of students\n= 1700 + 800 - 2001\n= 499\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students studying both languages.\n\n$M-m = 499 - 201 = 298$\n\nSo, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students studying both languages is $298$."
