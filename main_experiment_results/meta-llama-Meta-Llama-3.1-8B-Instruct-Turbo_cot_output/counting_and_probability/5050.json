    "solution": "Let the two disjoint subsets be $A$ and $B$, and let $C = S-(A+B)$. For each $i \\in S$, either $i \\in A$, $i \\in B$, or $i \\in C$. So there are $3^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ into disjoint $A$, $B$, and $C$.\nHowever, there are $2^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ such that $A = \\emptyset$ and $S = B+C$, and there are $2^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ such that $B = \\emptyset$ and $S = A+C$. But, the combination such that $A = B = \\emptyset$ and $S = C$ is counted twice.\nThus, there are $3^{10}-2\\cdot2^{10}+1$ ordered pairs of sets $(A,B)$. But since the question asks for the number of unordered sets $\\{ A,B \\}$, $n = \\frac{1}{2}(3^{10}-2\\cdot2^{10}+1) = 28501 \\equiv \\boxed{501} \\pmod{1000}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can think of it in terms of choosing 3 disjoint subsets. Let the subsets be $A$, $B$, and $C$, where $A\\cup B \\cup C = \\mathcal{S}$ and $A\\cap B = A\\cap C = B\\cap C = \\emptyset$. \n\nWe can define $C$ as the complement of the union of $A$ and $B$, i.e., $C=\\mathcal{S}-(A\\cup B)$. We can then conclude that the number of unordered pairs of disjoint sets is the same as the number of ordered pairs $(A,B)$.\n\nFor each $i\\in\\mathcal{S}$, let $a_i$ and $b_i$ be the number of ordered triples of disjoint sets $(A,B,C)$ such that $i\\in A$ and $i\\not \\in B$, and let $c_i$ be the number of ordered triples of disjoint sets $(A,B,C)$ such that $i\\not \\in A$ and $i\\not \\in B$.\n\nThen, $a_i=4^9$ for $i\\in \\mathcal{S}$.\n\nNext, $c_i=3^9$ for $i\\not \\in\\mathcal{S}$. However, since $\\mathcal{S}$ does contain the elements 1, 2, ..., 10, we have $c_i=3^9$ for $i\\in \\mathcal{S}$.\n\nLet $|A|$ and $|B|$ denote the number of elements in sets $A$ and $B$, respectively. Then the total number of ordered pairs of disjoint sets is\n\n$n = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} a_i + \\sum_{j=1}^{10} c_j - \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\sum_{j=1}^{10} a_i c_j$\n\nWe can then calculate the total number of ordered pairs of disjoint sets:\n\n$n = 4^{10} + 3^{10} - \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\sum_{j=1}^{10} 4^9 3^9$\n\nFor the second summand, note that for any $i$ and $j$, we have\n\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\sum_{j=1}^{10} a_i c_j = (10)(4^9)(3^9)$, since there are 10 choices for $i$, 4 choices for whether $i$ is in $A$ or $B$, 3 choices for whether $i$ is in $C$ or not, and 9 choices for the other elements.\n\nTherefore,\n\n$n = 4^{10} + 3^{10} - (10)(4^9)(3^9)$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$.\n\n$n \\pmod{1000} = (4^{10} + 3^{10} - (10)(4^9)(3^9)) \\pmod{1000}$.\n\nSimplifying this, we get\n\n$n \\pmod{1000} = (4^{10} + 3^{10} - (10)(4^9)(3^9)) \\pmod{1000}$\n$ = (1048576 + 59049 - (10)(3486784401)) \\pmod{1000}$\n$ = (1048576 + 59049 - 34867844010) \\pmod{1000}$\n$ = (-34867271185) \\pmod{1000}$\n$ = 79 \\pmod{1000}$\n\nTherefore, the remainder obtained when $n$ is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{79}$."
