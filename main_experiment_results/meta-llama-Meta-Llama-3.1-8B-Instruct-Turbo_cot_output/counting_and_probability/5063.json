    "problem": "The cards in a stack of $2n$ cards are numbered consecutively from 1 through $2n$ from top to bottom. The top $n$ cards are removed, kept in order, and form pile $A.$ The remaining cards form pile $B.$ The cards are then restacked by taking cards alternately from the tops of pile $B$ and $A,$ respectively. In this process, card number $(n+1)$ becomes the bottom card of the new stack, card number 1 is on top of this card, and so on, until piles $A$ and $B$ are exhausted. If, after the restacking process, at least one card from each pile occupies the same position that it occupied in the original stack, the stack is named magical. For example, eight cards form a magical stack because cards number 3 and number 6 retain their original positions. Find the number of cards in the magical stack in which card number 131 retains its original position.\n",
    "solution": "Since a card from B is placed on the bottom of the new stack, notice that cards from pile B will be marked as an even number in the new pile, while cards from pile A will be marked as odd in the new pile. Since 131 is odd and retains its original position in the stack, it must be in pile A. Also to retain its original position, exactly $131 - 1 = 130$ numbers must be in front of it. There are $\\frac{130}{2} = 65$ cards from each of piles A, B in front of card 131. This suggests that $n = 131 + 65 = 196$; the total number of cards is $196 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{392}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. There are $2n$ cards in total, numbered from 1 to $2n$.\n2. The top $n$ cards are removed and form pile A, leaving the remaining $n$ cards in pile B.\n3. When restacking the cards, we alternate between piles A and B. This means that card 1 is on top of card $(n+1)$, card 2 is on top of card $(n+2)$, and so on.\n4. If a card from pile A ends up on top after restacking, it must have come from the bottom of pile A. Similarly, if a card from pile B ends up on top, it must have come from the bottom of pile B.\n5. Since there are $n$ cards in pile A, the bottom card of pile A must be card number $n+1$. This means that card number $(n+1)$ ends up on top of pile A after restacking.\n6. Similarly, the bottom card of pile B must be card number $2n$.\n7. When restacking the cards, card number $131$ from pile A must end up on top of card number $131$ from pile B after restacking. This means that card number $131$ from pile A must be the second card from the top of pile A, and card number $131$ from pile B must be the second card from the top of pile B.\n8. Since there are $n$ cards in pile A, the second card from the top of pile A must be card number $131-1=130$.\n9. Similarly, the second card from the top of pile B must be card number $2n-131+1=2n-130$.\n10. Since card number $130$ is the second card from the top of pile A, it means that card number $n+130$ ends up on top of card number $131$ after restacking.\n11. Similarly, since card number $2n-130$ is the second card from the top of pile B, it means that card number $131+130-1=n+131-1$ ends up on top of card number $131$ after restacking.\n12. Let's call the position of card number $131$ in the new stack $k$. Then, card number $n+130$ ends up on top of card number $k$, and card number $n+131-1$ ends up on top of card number $131$.\n13. Since card number $n+131-1$ ends up on top of card number $131$, it means that card number $n+131-1-k=n+131-1-(n+130)=131-k$ ends up on top of card number $k$.\n14. Since card number $n+130$ ends up on top of card number $k$, it means that card number $n+130-k=n+130-(131-k)=n-1+k$ ends up on top of card number $k$.\n15. Therefore, we have two equations: $131-k=n-1+k$ and $n-1+k=131-k$.\n16. Solving the first equation for $k$, we get $k=66$.\n17. Solving the second equation for $k$, we get $k=66$.\n18. Since card number $131$ ends up on top of card number $66$ after restacking, it means that there are at least two cards from each pile that retain their original positions.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of cards in the magical stack. Since card number $131$ ends up on top of card number $66$ after restacking, it means that card number $131$ is at position $66+1=67$ in the new stack. Similarly, card number $131$ is at position $131$ in the original stack.\n\nSince card number $131$ retains its original position, it must be at the same position in the new stack. This means that the total number of cards in the magical stack is $2n=2\\cdot 196=392$.\n\nTherefore, the number of cards in the magical stack in which card number $131$ retains its original position is $392$."
