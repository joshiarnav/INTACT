    "problem": "A paperboy delivers newspapers to 10 houses along Main Street. Wishing to save effort, he doesn't always deliver to every house, but to avoid being fired he never misses three consecutive houses. Compute the number of ways the paperboy could deliver papers in this manner.\n",
    "solution": "We can find a recursion. Let $D_n$ be the number of legal delivery sequences for $n$ houses. If a sequence ends with a delivery, we simply append one to $D_{n - 1}$. If it ends in $1$ nondelivery, we append a nondelivery and a delivery to $D_{n - 2}$. If it ends in $2$ nondeliveries, we append them and a delivery to $D_{n - 3}$. So\n$D_n = D_{n - 1} + D_{n - 2} + D_{n - 3}$.\nThus, since clearly $D_1 = 2$, $D_2 = 4$, $D_3 = 7$, we have $D_4 = 13$, $D_5 = 24$, $D_6 = 44$, $D_7 = 81$, $D_8 = 149$, $D_9 = 274$, $D_{10} = \\boxed{504}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of ways the paperboy could deliver papers, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Base Case:** \n   - If the paperboy never misses three consecutive houses, he can either deliver (D) or not deliver (N) to each house.\n   - For the first house, there are 2 possibilities: D or N.\n   - For the second house, there are also 2 possibilities: D or N, regardless of the first house.\n   - For the third house, there are 2 possibilities again: D or N. But, if the paperboy doesn't deliver to the second house, he must deliver to the third house, so the number of possibilities remains 2.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation:**\n   - For the first house, there are 2 possibilities.\n   - For the second house, there are 2 possibilities.\n   - For the third house, considering the previous two houses, we have the following cases:\n    - If the first two houses have a delivery (DD or DN), then the third house can be either D or N, resulting in 2 possibilities.\n    - If the first two houses have no delivery (ND or NN), then the third house must have a delivery (D) to avoid missing three consecutive houses, resulting in 1 possibility.\n   - The recurrence relation can be represented as:\n     - For the 3rd house: 2 (depending on the first two houses) + 1 (if the first two houses have no delivery) = 3 possibilities.\n     - For the 4th house: 2 (deliveries from the 1st and 2nd houses can be either D or N) + 2 (if the first two houses have a delivery, the third has no delivery) + 1 (if the first three houses have no delivery) = 5 possibilities.\n     - For the 5th house: 2 + 2*2 + 2*1 + 1 = 9 possibilities.\n     - For the nth house, the recurrence relation can be generalized as follows:\n        - If the (n-1)th and (n-2)th houses have a delivery, then the nth house has 2 possibilities.\n        - If the (n-2)th house has a delivery and the (n-1)th house has no delivery, then the nth house has 2 possibilities.\n        - If the (n-3)th house has a delivery, then the nth house has 1 possibility.\n        - If the (n-3)th house has no delivery, then the nth house has 1 possibility.\n        - Using these cases, we can derive a recurrence relation for the nth house.\n\n3. **Recurrence Relation Formula:**\n   - Let a_n be the number of ways to deliver papers to n houses.\n   - The recurrence relation can be written as: a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}.\n\n4. **Initial Conditions:**\n   - a_1 = 2 (for the first house, there are 2 possibilities).\n   - a_2 = 3 (for the second house, there are 2 possibilities).\n   - a_3 = 4 (for the third house, there are 3 possibilities).\n\n5. **Solving the Recurrence Relation:**\n   - To find a_10 (the number of ways to deliver papers to 10 houses), we can use the recurrence relation to compute the values of a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9, and a_10.\n\n6. **Equivalence to Fibonacci Sequence:**\n   - We can observe that the recurrence relation a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3} is equivalent to the Fibonacci sequence, but with different initial conditions.\n   - The Fibonacci sequence has the recurrence relation F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} with initial conditions F_1 = 1 and F_2 = 1.\n   - We can modify the recurrence relation to match the Fibonacci sequence by subtracting the two equations, which results in:\n     - a_n - a_{n-3} = a_{n-1} - a_{n-3} + a_{n-2} - a_{n-3}\n     - This simplifies to:\n     - a_n - a_{n-3} = (a_{n-1} - a_{n-3}) + (a_{n-2} - a_{n-3})\n\n7. **Derivation of a_n - a_{n-3}:**\n   - Let b_n = a_n - a_{n-3}.\n   - Then the recurrence relation becomes: b_n = b_{n-1} + b_{n-2}.\n   - We can use this recurrence relation to compute b_4, b_5, b_6, b_7, b_8, b_9, and b_10.\n\n8. **Initial Conditions for b_n:**\n   - b_1 = a_1 - a_{-2} = 2 - 0 = 2 (since a_{-2} doesn't exist).\n   - b_2 = a_2 - a_{-1} = 3 - 0 = 3 (since a_{-1} doesn't exist).\n   - b_3 = a_3 - a_0 = 4 - 0 = 4 (since a_0 doesn't exist).\n\n9. **Solving the Recurrence Relation for b_n:**\n   - We can compute the values of b_4, b_5, b_6, b_7, b_8, b_9, and b_10 using the recurrence relation b_n = b_{n-1} + b_{n-2}.\n\n10. **Finding a_10:**\n    - We can compute a_10 using the values of b_4, b_5, b_6, b_7, b_8, b_9, and b_10: a_10 = b_10 + a_7.\n\nUsing the recurrence relation and the initial conditions, we can compute the values of a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9, and a_10.\n\nHere's the computation:\n\n- a_4 = a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9\n- a_5 = a_4 + a_3 + a_2 = 9 + 4 + 3 = 16\n- a_6 = a_5 + a_4 + a_3 = 16 + 9 + 4 = 29\n- a_7 = a_6 + a_5 + a_4 = 29 + 16 + 9 = 54\n- a_8 = a_7 + a_6 + a_5 = 54 + 29 + 16 = 99\n- a_9 = a_8 + a_7 + a_6 = 99 + 54 + 29 = 182\n- a_10 = a_9 + a_8 + a_7 = 182 + 99 + 54 = 335\n\nTherefore, the number of ways the paperboy could deliver papers in this manner is 335."
