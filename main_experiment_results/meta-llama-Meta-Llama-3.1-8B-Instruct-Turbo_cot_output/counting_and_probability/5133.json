    "problem": "How many 10-digit positive integers have all digits either 1 or 2, and have two consecutive 1's?\n",
    "solution": "We take as our universe the set of 10-digit integers whose digits are all either 1 or 2, of which there are $2^{10}$, and we count the complement. The complement is the set of 10-digit positive integers composed of the digits 1 and 2 with no two consecutive 1s. Counting such numbers is a popular combinatorial problem: we approach it via a recursion.\nThere are two \"good\" one-digit numbers (1 and 2) and three good two-digit numbers (12, 21 and 22). Each such $n$-digit number is formed either by gluing \"2\" on to the end of a good $(n - 1)$-digit number or by gluing \"21\" onto the end of a good $(n - 2)$-digit number. This is a bijection between the good $n$-digit numbers and the union of the good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. Thus, the number of good $n$-digit numbers is the sum of the number of good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. The resulting recursion is exactly that of the Fibonacci numbers with initial values $F_1 = 2$ and $F_2 = 3$.\nThus, our final answer is $2^{10} - F_{10} = 1024 - 144 = \\boxed{880}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\n1. **Total number of 10-digit integers with digits 1 or 2**: \n   Each digit can be either 1 or 2, so there are 2 possibilities for each of the 10 digits.\n   The total number of such integers is 2^10 = 1024.\n\n2. **Number of 10-digit integers with no consecutive 1's**:\n   To calculate this, we can use a recursive approach or dynamic programming. Let's denote the number of n-digit integers with no consecutive 1's as a(n).\n   For a single-digit integer (n=1), there are 2 possibilities: 1 or 2. So, a(1) = 2.\n   For a two-digit integer (n=2), if the first digit is 2, the second digit can be either 1 or 2. If the first digit is 1, the second digit must be 2. So, a(2) = 3.\n   For a three-digit integer (n=3), if the first two digits are 22, the third digit can be 1 or 2. If the first two digits are 21, the third digit must be 2. If the first digit is 2, the second digit can be 1 or 2. If the first digit is 1, the second digit must be 2. So, a(3) = 5.\n   We can see a pattern here: a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2). This is because we can form an n-digit integer with no consecutive 1's by appending 2 to an (n-1)-digit integer (giving us a(n-1) such integers) or by appending 2 to an (n-2)-digit integer (giving us a(n-2) such integers).\n   Using this recurrence relation, we can calculate a(10) as follows:\n   a(4) = a(3) + a(2) = 5 + 3 = 8\n   a(5) = a(4) + a(3) = 8 + 5 = 13\n   a(6) = a(5) + a(4) = 13 + 8 = 21\n   a(7) = a(6) + a(5) = 21 + 13 = 34\n   a(8) = a(7) + a(6) = 34 + 21 = 55\n   a(9) = a(8) + a(7) = 55 + 34 = 89\n   a(10) = a(9) + a(8) = 89 + 55 = 144\n\n   So, there are 144 10-digit integers with no consecutive 1's.\n\n3. **Number of 10-digit integers with two consecutive 1's**:\n   This is equal to the total number of 10-digit integers with digits 1 or 2 minus the number of 10-digit integers with no consecutive 1's.\n   Therefore, there are 1024 - 144 = 880 10-digit integers with two consecutive 1's.\n\nThe final answer is 880."
