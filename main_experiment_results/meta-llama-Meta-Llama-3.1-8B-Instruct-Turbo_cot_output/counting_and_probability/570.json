    "problem": "If Greg rolls four fair six-sided dice, what is the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's?",
    "solution": "We notice that the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's must equal the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's. So, we can find the probability that Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's, subtract it from 1, and divide by 2 to find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's. There are three ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's: he can roll two of each, one of each, or none of each. If he rolls two of each, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which two dice roll the 1's. If he rolls one of each, there are $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1}=12$ ways to choose which dice are the 6 and the 1, and for each of those ways there are $4\\cdot4=16$ ways to choose the values of the other dice. If Greg rolls no 1's or 6's, there are $4^4=256$ possible values for the dice. In total, there are $6+12\\cdot16+256=454$ ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's. There are $6^4=1296$ total ways the four dice can roll, so the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\left(1-\\dfrac{454}{1296}\\right)=\\boxed{\\dfrac{421}{1296}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's, let's break the problem down into manageable steps.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\nWe are rolling four fair six-sided dice. Each die can result in a number from 1 to 6, inclusive. We want to find the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's.\n\n**Step 2: Define the outcomes**\n\nTo roll more 1's than 6's, we need to have either:\n\n* More 1's than 6's (i.e., more 1's than 6's and the same number of 6's as 1's is not allowed)\n* The same number of 1's and 6's, and more 1's than 6's in the remaining two dice.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of favorable outcomes**\n\nWe can use the complement principle to simplify the problem. We will count the number of outcomes where either there are more 6's than 1's or the number of 6's and 1's is the same.\n\nLet's count the outcomes where there are more 6's than 1's:\n\n* Rolling 1 six and 3 other numbers (not 1 or 6): There are 5 options for the first die (2, 3, 4, 5) and 4 options for each of the other two dice (2, 3, 4, 5). This gives 5 * 4 * 4 = 80 outcomes.\n* Rolling 2 sixes and 2 other numbers (not 1 or 6): There are 5 options for the first die (2, 3, 4, 5) and 4 options for the second die (2, 3, 4, 5). This gives 5 * 4 = 20 options for the first two dice. For the last two dice, there are 5 options for the first die (2, 3, 4, 5) and 4 options for the second die (2, 3, 4, 5). This gives 5 * 4 = 20 options for the last two dice. This gives 20 * 20 = 400 outcomes.\n* Rolling 3 sixes and 1 other number (not 1 or 6): There are 5 options for the last die (2, 3, 4, 5) and 4 options for each of the other three dice (2, 3, 4, 5). This gives 4 * 5 = 20 options for the last three dice. This gives 20 * 5 = 100 outcomes.\n* Rolling 4 sixes: There is only 1 outcome.\n\nIn total, there are 80 + 400 + 100 + 1 = 581 outcomes where there are more 6's than 1's.\n\nNow, let's count the outcomes where the number of 6's and 1's is the same:\n\n* Rolling 2 of each and 0 of the other two numbers: There are 4 options for the first die (2, 3, 4, 5) and 4 options for the second die (2, 3, 4, 5). This gives 4 * 4 = 16 options for the first two dice. For the last two dice, there are 4 options for the first die (2, 3, 4, 5). For the last die, there are 4 options (2, 3, 4, 5). This gives 16 * 4 = 64 outcomes.\n* Rolling 1 of each and 1 of the other two numbers (either 1 or 6): There are 4 options for the first die (2, 3, 4, 5). There are 4 options for the second die (2, 3, 4, 5). This gives 4 * 4 = 16 options for the first two dice. For the last die, there are 4 options (2, 3, 4, 5). This gives 16 * 4 = 64 outcomes.\n\nIn total, there are 64 + 64 = 128 outcomes where the number of 6's and 1's is the same.\n\nHowever, we need to subtract these outcomes from the total number of outcomes where there are more 6's than 1's. Since we know that the number of 6's and 1's is the same in these outcomes, we need to make sure that in these outcomes, more 1's than 6's are not rolled. This is already true in these outcomes. We also need to remove the outcomes where there are more 1's than 6's and the same number of 6's as 1's is not allowed, which we have already counted in the total number of outcomes where there are more 6's than 1's.\n\nWith this in mind, we will be counting the outcomes where the number of 6's and 1's is the same and more 1's than 6's are rolled, which we know are the outcomes where there are 2 of each and 2 of the other two numbers (either 1 or 6) and 1 of each and 1 of the other two numbers (either 1 or 6). But then we need to exclude the outcomes where the number of 6's and 1's is the same and more 1's than 6's are rolled, which we know are the outcomes where there are 1 of each and the other two dice are 1 and not 6 and the other two dice are 6 and not 1, which we did not count.\n\nTo count these outcomes, we need to count the outcomes where there are 1 of each and the other two dice are 1 and not 6 and the other two dice are 6 and not 1. For the first die, there are 4 options (3, 4, 5). For the second die, there are 4 options (3, 4, 5). For the last two dice, there are 4 options for the first die (3, 4, 5) and 4 options for the second die (3, 4, 5). This gives 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 256 outcomes.\n\nWith this in mind, we will subtract these outcomes from the total number of outcomes where there are more 6's than 1's.\n\nThe total number of outcomes where there are more 6's than 1's is 581.\n\nHowever, we need to remove the outcomes where there are more 1's than 6's and the same number of 6's as 1's is not allowed, which we have already counted in the total number of outcomes where there are more 6's than 1's.\n\nThe total number of outcomes where there are more 1's than 6's and the same number of 6's as 1's is not allowed is 128 - 256 = -128.\n\nSince we cannot have a negative number of outcomes, we need to use the complement principle.\n\nThe total number of outcomes where either there are more 6's than 1's or the number of 6's and 1's is the same is the total number of outcomes (6^4) minus the total number of outcomes where either there are more 1's than 6's or the number of 6's and 1's is the same.\n\nThe total number of outcomes is 6^4 = 1296.\n\nThe total number of outcomes where either there are more 1's than 6's or the number of 6's and 1's is the same is 581 + 128 = 709.\n\nThe total number of outcomes where either there are more 6's than 1's or the number of 6's and 1's is the same is 1296 - 709 = 587.\n\nHowever, we need to use the complement principle.\n\nThe total number of outcomes where either there are more 6's than 1's or the number of 6's and 1's is the same is the total number of outcomes minus the total number of outcomes where there are more 1's than 6's.\n\nThe total number of outcomes is 1296.\n\nThe total number of outcomes where there are more 1's than 6's is 587.\n\nWith this in mind, we can use the complement principle.\n\nThe probability of rolling more 1's than 6's is the total number of outcomes where there are more 1's than 6's divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\nThe total number of outcomes is 1296.\n\nThe total number of outcomes where there are more 1's than 6's is 587.\n\nThe probability of rolling more 1's than 6's is 587/1296.\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator.\n\nThe GCD of 587 and 1296 is 1.\n\nSince the GCD is 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nThe probability of rolling more 1's than 6's is 587/1296.\n\nTo convert the fraction to a decimal, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator.\n\nThe probability of rolling more 1's than 6's is 587/1296 \u2248 0.453."
