    "problem": "An integer greater than 9 and less than 100 is randomly chosen. What is the probability that its digits are different?",
    "solution": "We calculate the probability that the digits are the same, and subtract from 1. From the 90 integers to be chosen from, only 9 have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, ..., 99. Therefore, the probability that the digits are the same is $\\frac{9}{90} = \\frac{1}{10}$, so the probability that the digits are different is $1-\\frac{1}{10}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the digits of a randomly chosen two-digit number are different, we need to consider the total number of two-digit numbers and the number of two-digit numbers with different digits.\n\n1. **Total number of two-digit numbers**: \n   The smallest two-digit number is 10 and the largest is 99. So, the total number of two-digit numbers is 99 - 10 + 1 = 90.\n\n2. **Number of two-digit numbers with different digits**:\n   - For the tens digit (first digit), we have 9 choices (1-9) because we are excluding 0.\n   - For the units digit (second digit), we have 9 choices if the tens digit is 1, but we have 9-1=8 choices if the tens digit is not 1 (2 through 9) because we need to exclude the tens digit itself to ensure the digits are different. However, for every tens digit choice, we have 9 options for the units digit because we can exclude only one number (the tens number). To put it more simply, we have 9 choices for the first digit and then for every choice, 9 choices for the second digit.\n   We can just multiply these choices together: 9 * 9 = 81. \n   However, we should note that we are excluding any number that could have repeating digits, such as 11, 22, 33, and so on; these numbers are 9 in total (0 as a tens place is not excluded, but the result is still 9). \n\n3. **Final calculation**:\n   To find the number of two-digit numbers with different digits, we need to subtract the numbers with repeating digits (9) from the total number of two-digit numbers with different digits (81), but we will just use 81 as our number because that is the total count result:\n\n   Probability = (number of two-digit numbers with different digits) / (total number of two-digit numbers)\n   = 81 / 90\n\n   To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9:\n\n   Probability = (81 / 9) / (90 / 9)\n   = 9 / 10\n\n   So, the probability that the digits of a randomly chosen two-digit number are different is 9/10."
