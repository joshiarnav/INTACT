    "problem": "Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards (13 hearts, 13 clubs, 13 spades, and 13 diamonds).  What is the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen?",
    "solution": "The probability that the first card is a 6 is $\\dfrac{1}{13}$.  There are then 51 cards remaining, so the probability the second card is a Queen is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  The answer is then $\\dfrac{1}{13} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{663}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability of the first card being a 6 and the second card being a Queen, we need to consider the two events separately and then multiply the probabilities.\n\nStep 1: Probability of the first card being a 6\nThere are 4 sixes in a standard deck of 52 cards (one in each suit). So, the probability of drawing a 6 as the first card is:\nNumber of sixes / Total number of cards = 4 / 52 = 1 / 13.\n\nStep 2: Probability of the second card being a Queen\nAfter drawing the first card, there are 51 cards left in the deck. There are 4 Queens in the deck. So, the probability of drawing a Queen as the second card is:\nNumber of Queens / Total number of remaining cards = 4 / 51.\n\nStep 3: Probability of both events occurring\nTo find the probability that both events occur (first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen), we multiply the probabilities of the two events:\n(Probability of the first card being a 6) \u00d7 (Probability of the second card being a Queen)\n= (1 / 13) \u00d7 (4 / 51)\n= 4 / (13 \u00d7 51)\n= 4 / 663\n\nSo, the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen is 4 / 663."
