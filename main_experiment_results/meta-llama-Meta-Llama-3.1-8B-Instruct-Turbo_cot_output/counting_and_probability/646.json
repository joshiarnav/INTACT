    "problem": "A Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans. Assuming all politicians are distinguishable, in how many ways can they sit around a circular table without restrictions?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "There are 10 people to place, so we can place them in $10!$ ways, but this counts each valid arrangement 10 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement).  So the number of ways to seat them is $\\dfrac{10!}{10} = 9! = \\boxed{362,\\!880}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total number of ways the senators can sit around a circular table, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. First, consider arranging the 10 senators in a linear fashion. This can be done in 10! (factorial) ways since there are 10 choices for the first seat, 9 for the second, and so on.\n\n2. However, we need to account for the fact that the table is circular. This means that any rotation of a seating arrangement should be considered the same.\n\n3. To account for this, we can divide the total number of linear arrangements by the number of people at the table, which is 10. This is because each seating arrangement can be rotated 10 times and still be considered the same.\n\n4. Therefore, the total number of unique seating arrangements around the circular table is:\n\n10! / 10\n= 9! * 10 / 10\n= 9! * 1 * 10 / 10\n= 9!"
