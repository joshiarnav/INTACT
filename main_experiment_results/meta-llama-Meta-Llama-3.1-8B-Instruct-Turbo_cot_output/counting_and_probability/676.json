    "problem": "I have 10 distinguishable socks in my drawer: 4 white, 4 brown, and 2 blue.  In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of the same color?",
    "solution": "The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue.  If the socks are white, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are brown, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are blue, there is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ choice.  So the total number of choices for socks is $6 + 6 + 1 = \\boxed{13}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of ways to choose a pair of socks with the same color, we can break it down into three cases.\n\n**Case 1: Choosing 2 white socks**\nWe have 4 white socks, and we want to choose 2 of them. We can use the combination formula to find the number of ways: C(4, 2) = (4!)/(2!*(4-2)!) = (4*3)/(2) = 6.\n\n**Case 2: Choosing 2 brown socks**\nWe have 4 brown socks, and we want to choose 2 of them. Using the combination formula, we get: C(4, 2) = (4!)/(2!*(4-2)!) = (4*3)/(2) = 6.\n\n**Case 3: Choosing 2 blue socks**\nWe have 2 blue socks, and we want to choose 2 of them. Since there are only 2 blue socks, there is only one way to choose both: C(2, 2) = 1.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks with the same color, we add the number of ways from each case: 6 (white) + 6 (brown) + 1 (blue) = 13.\n\nTherefore, there are 13 ways to choose a pair of socks such that both socks are of the same color."
