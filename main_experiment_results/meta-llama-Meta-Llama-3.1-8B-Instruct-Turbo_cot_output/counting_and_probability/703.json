    "model_solution": "To find the number of ways George can choose two out of seven colors, we'll use the concept of combinations. \n\nStep 1: First, we need to calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 colors out of 7 without considering the order. This is a combination problem, where the order of selection does not matter.\n\nStep 2: The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 7 (total colors), and k = 2 (colors to choose).\n\nStep 3: Plug the values into the formula:\nC(7, 2) = 7! / [2!(7-2)!]\n\nStep 4: Calculate the factorials:\n7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040\n2! = 2 * 1 = 2\n(7-2)! = 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n\nStep 5: Substitute the factorial values into the formula:\nC(7, 2) = 5040 / (2 * 120)\nC(7, 2) = 5040 / 240\nC(7, 2) = 21\n\nTherefore, George can choose two out of seven colors in 21 different ways."
