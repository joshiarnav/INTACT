    "problem": "Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace?",
    "solution": "We have two cases because if the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$, it could be an ace or not be an ace.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{3}{51} = \\dfrac{1}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the three remaining aces, which gives a probability of $\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot \\dfrac{1}{17} = \\dfrac{1}{884}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{12}{52} = \\dfrac{3}{13}$ chance that a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the ace is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{4}{51}$ chance that an ace is drawn second, giving a $\\dfrac{3}{13}\\cdot \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{4}{221}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nSo the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\\dfrac{1}{884} + \\dfrac{4}{221} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}$.\n\nNotice that we can avoid some of the large denominators above by organizing this computation as follows: $$\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{3}{51}+\\dfrac{12}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{1\\cdot 3+12\\cdot 4}{52\\cdot 51} = \\dfrac{51}{52\\cdot 51}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}.$$",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace, we can break it down into two steps: \n\n1. First, we find the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$. In a standard deck of 52 cards, there are 13 $\\diamondsuit$ cards. So, the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ is $\\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n2. Now, we need to find the probability that the second card is an ace, given that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$. There are 4 aces in a deck of 52 cards. However, there are two cases to consider: \n   - If the first card is the ace of $\\diamondsuit$, then there are only 3 aces left in the deck. In this case, the probability that the second card is an ace is $\\frac{3}{51}$.\n   - If the first card is not the ace of $\\diamondsuit$, then there are 4 aces left in the deck. In this case, the probability that the second card is an ace is $\\frac{4}{51}$.\n\nTo find the overall probability, we need to consider the probability of both cases. The probability that the first card is the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is $\\frac{1}{52}$, and the probability that the first card is not the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is $\\frac{12}{52}$. \n\nSo, the overall probability is:\n$\\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51} + \\frac{12}{52} \\times \\frac{4}{51} = \\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51} + \\frac{3}{13} \\times \\frac{4}{51} = \\frac{3}{2652} + \\frac{12}{663} = \\frac{3 + 312}{2652} = \\frac{315}{2652} = \\frac{35}{292}$"
