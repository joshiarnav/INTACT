    "problem": "Seven people arrive to dinner, but the circular table only seats six.  If two seatings such that one is a rotation of the other are considered the same, then in how many different ways can we choose six people and seat them at the table?",
    "solution": "There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing.  To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person.  This suggests that there are $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people.  However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count.  Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table.  There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Choosing 6 people out of 7**: We need to select 6 people out of the 7 who arrived for dinner. This is a combination problem, since the order in which we choose the people doesn't matter.\n   The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!) where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1).\n\n   In this case, we have n = 7 (total people) and k = 6 (people to choose).\n   So, the number of ways to choose 6 people out of 7 is:\n   C(7, 6) = 7! / (6! * (7 - 6)!) = 7! / (6! * 1!) = 7\n\n2. **Seating the chosen 6 people**: Once we have chosen 6 people, we need to seat them at the table.\n   The table is circular, so rotations of the same seating arrangement are considered the same.\n   To account for this, we can fix one person's position at the table (e.g., at the top) and arrange the remaining 5 people around them.\n   This is a permutation problem, since the order in which we seat the people matters.\n\n   There are 5! ways to arrange 5 people in a linear sequence (e.g., 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1).\n   However, since the table is circular, we need to divide this number by the number of rotations that result in the same arrangement (i.e., 5! / 5 = 5! / (5 * 1) = 4).\n\n   So, for each set of 6 chosen people, there are 5! / 5 = 4! ways to seat them at the table.\n\n3. **Combining the choices**: To find the total number of different ways to seat 6 people at the table, we need to multiply the number of ways to choose 6 people by the number of ways to seat them.\n\n   The number of ways to choose 6 people is 7 (from step 1).\n   The number of ways to seat 6 people once chosen is 4! (from step 2).\n\n   Therefore, the total number of different ways to choose 6 people and seat them at the table is:\n   7 \u00d7 4! = 7 \u00d7 (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 7 \u00d7 24 = 168"
