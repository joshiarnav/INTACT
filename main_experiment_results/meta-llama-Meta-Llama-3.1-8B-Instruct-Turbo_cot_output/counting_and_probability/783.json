    "solution": "We consider the unordered pairs, or sets, of spins for which the difference of the numbers are greater than or equal to 3, or those games which Jane loses. These can only occur in the sets $\\{1, 4\\}$, $\\{1, 5 \\}$ or $\\{ 2, 5 \\}$. Each of these unordered pairs can occur in 2 orderings (depending on whether Jane or her brother spins each number). So, there are $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ losing combinations out of $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ for Jane. So, her winning probability is $1 - \\frac{6}{25} = \\boxed{\\frac{19}{25}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that Jane wins, we first need to list all possible pairs of numbers that Jane and her brother can spin. There are 5 possible numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and they each spin the spinner once, so there are a total of 5 x 5 = 25 possible pairs of numbers.\n\nNow, let's find the pairs where the non-negative difference is less than 3. \n\n1. If Jane spins a 1 and her brother spins a 1, the difference is 0, so Jane wins.\n2. If Jane spins a 1 and her brother spins a 2, the difference is 1, so Jane wins.\n3. If Jane spins a 1 and her brother spins a 3, the difference is 2, so Jane wins.\n4. If Jane spins a 1 and her brother spins a 4 or 5, the difference is more than 2, so Jane loses.\n5. If Jane spins a 2 and her brother spins a 1, the difference is 1, so Jane wins.\n6. If Jane spins a 2 and her brother spins a 2, the difference is 0, so Jane wins.\n7. If Jane spins a 2 and her brother spins a 3, the difference is 1, so Jane wins.\n8. If Jane spins a 2 and her brother spins a 4 or 5, the difference is more than 2, so Jane loses.\n9. If Jane spins a 3 and her brother spins a 1, the difference is 2, so Jane wins.\n10. If Jane spins a 3 and her brother spins a 2, the difference is 1, so Jane wins.\n11. If Jane spins a 3 and her brother spins a 3, the difference is 0, so Jane wins.\n12. If Jane spins a 3 and her brother spins a 4 or 5, the difference is more than 2, so Jane loses.\n13. If Jane spins a 4 and her brother spins a 1, the difference is 3, so Jane loses.\n14. If Jane spins a 4 and her brother spins a 2, the difference is 2, so Jane wins.\n15. If Jane spins a 4 and her brother spins a 3, the difference is 1, so Jane wins.\n16. If Jane spins a 4 and her brother spins a 4, the difference is 0, so Jane wins.\n17. If Jane spins a 4 and her brother spins a 5, the difference is 1, so Jane wins.\n18. If Jane spins a 5 and her brother spins a 1, the difference is 4, so Jane loses.\n19. If Jane spins a 5 and her brother spins a 2, the difference is 3, so Jane loses.\n20. If Jane spins a 5 and her brother spins a 3, the difference is 2, so Jane loses.\n21. If Jane spins a 5 and her brother spins a 4, the difference is 1, so Jane wins.\n22. If Jane spins a 5 and her brother spins a 5, the difference is 0, so Jane wins.\n\nNow, let's count how many times Jane wins: Jane wins 15 of the 25 possible pairs of numbers.\n\nThe probability that Jane wins is the number of times Jane wins divided by the total number of pairs, which is $\\frac{15}{25} = \\frac{3}{5}$."
