    "problem": "A math conference is presenting a lecture series with six different lecturers. If Dr. Smith's lecture depends on Dr. Jones's lecture, so that Dr. Smith must be scheduled at some time after Dr. Jones, in how many orders can the six lecturers be scheduled?",
    "solution": "There are a total of $6!$ ways to order the 6 lectures with no restriction. By symmetry, exactly half of these will have Dr. Jones's lecture before Dr. Smith's lecture. Thus there are $6!/2 = \\boxed{360}$ ways to schedule the conference.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Total possible orders without restrictions\nIf we had no restrictions on the order of lectures, there would be 6! (6 factorial) ways to schedule the 6 lecturers. \n\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720\n\nStep 2: Calculating the number of orders where Dr. Smith is scheduled before Dr. Jones\nNow, we need to find the number of orders where Dr. Smith is scheduled before Dr. Jones. In this case, we can treat Dr. Smith and Dr. Jones as a single unit (since their order is fixed), and we have 5 units (the Dr. Jones-Dr. Smith unit, plus the 4 other lecturers) to arrange. \n\nThere are 5! ways to arrange these 5 units.\n\n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n\nSince Dr. Smith and Dr. Jones can be arranged in 2! (2 factorial) ways (either Dr. Smith is scheduled before Dr. Jones, or Dr. Jones is scheduled before Dr. Smith), we need to multiply the number of arrangements of the 5 units by 2!.\n\n2! = 2 * 1 = 2\n\nNow, we have 120 * 2 = 240 orders where Dr. Smith is scheduled before Dr. Jones.\n\nStep 3: Total possible orders where Dr. Smith is scheduled after Dr. Jones\nSince there are a total of 720 possible orders (Step 1), and 240 of them are orders where Dr. Smith is scheduled before Dr. Jones (Step 2), we can find the total possible orders where Dr. Smith is scheduled after Dr. Jones by subtracting the number of orders where Dr. Smith is scheduled before Dr. Jones from the total possible orders.\n\n720 - 240 = 480\n\nTherefore, there are 480 possible orders where Dr. Smith is scheduled after Dr. Jones."
