    "problem": "Define a $\\it{good\\ word}$ as a sequence of letters that consists only of the letters $A$, $B$, and $C$ --- some of these letters may not appear in the sequence --- and in which $A$ is never immediately followed by $B$, $B$ is never immediately followed by $C$, and $C$ is never immediately followed by $A$. How many seven-letter good words are there?",
    "solution": "There are three choices for the first letter and two choices for each subsequent letter, so there are $3\\cdot2^{n-1}\\ n$-letter good words.  Substitute $n=7$ to find there are $3\\cdot2^6=\\boxed{192}$ seven-letter good words.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this, we can break down the process into steps. Let's consider the sequence of letters as a series of numbers, where $A=0$, $B=1$, and $C=2$. With this in mind, we can rephrase the problem: we want to count the number of sequences of seven numbers that do not satisfy the condition $i \\equiv i+1 \\pmod 3$, where the numbers are in $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n\nNow we can consider sequences of length $1$. In this case, there are $3$ options: $0$, $1$, or $2$. Now, let's consider sequences of length $2$. \n\nLet $a$ be the number of sequences of length $2$ in which no two consecutive numbers satisfy $i \\equiv i+1 \\pmod 3$. If the second number is $0$, then the first number can be any number in $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$. If the second number is $1$, then the first number can be any number in $\\{0, 2\\}$. If the second number is $2$, then the first number can be any number in $\\{1, 2\\}$.\n\nThis implies that the number of sequences of length $2$ in which no two consecutive numbers satisfy $i \\equiv i+1 \\pmod 3$ is $(3+2+2) = 7$.\n\nWe can extend this to sequences of length $3$ and beyond. If we have a sequence of length $2$, we can append any of the three numbers to the end to get a sequence of length $3$. However, we need to be careful not to append a number that would violate the condition $i \\equiv i+1 \\pmod 3$. So, we can only append a number if the two numbers before it do not satisfy $i \\equiv i+1 \\pmod 3$.\n\nThis means that the number of sequences of length $3$ is equal to the number of sequences of length $2$ in which no two consecutive numbers satisfy $i \\equiv i+1 \\pmod 3$, multiplied by the number of numbers that can be appended to such a sequence.\n\nSo, we have $a(3) = 7$, and similarly, the number of sequences of length $4$ is $a(3)$, and the number of sequences of length $5$ is $a(3)$, and so on.\n\nNow we can see that the number of sequences of length $n$ is $3a$, where $a$ is the number of sequences of length $n-1$. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of this recurrence relation is $r^1 - 3 = 0$, which has the solution $r = 3$. So, the general solution is $a_n = c \\cdot 3^n$, where $c$ is a constant.\n\nWe already know that $a_2 = 7$. So, we can write:\n\n$c \\cdot 3^2 = 7$\n\n$9c = 7$\n\n$c = 7/9$\n\nNow we can find the number of sequences of length $7$:\n\n$a_7 = c \\cdot 3^7$\n\n$a_7 = (7/9) \\cdot 3^7$\n\n$a_7 = 7 \\cdot (3^6)$\n\n$a_7 = 7 \\cdot 729$\n\n$a_7 = 5103$\n\nNote that we've simply used the 3rd step as an example to simply 3^6 = 729"
