Start with the leftmost tile. Color it red.\n2. Consider the tiles directly adjacent to the leftmost tile. These tiles share a side with the leftmost tile and must be colored differently. Color them blue.\n3. Now look at the tiles adjacent to the blue tiles. These tiles share a side with the blue tiles and must be colored differently. Color them red (since the blue tiles are red).\n4. Repeat step 3 with the red tiles from step 1. The tiles adjacent to these red tiles must be colored blue."
