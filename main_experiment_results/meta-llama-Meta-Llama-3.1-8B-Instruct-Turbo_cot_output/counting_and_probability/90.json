    "problem": "If I roll 5 standard 6-sided dice and multiply the number on the face of each die, what is the probability that the result is a composite number?",
    "solution": "While it is almost tempting to make this into the casework problem to end all casework problems, using complementary probability makes the problem a lot simpler, so we will find the probability that the product is not composite.\n\nIt's clear that if more than one die shows a roll greater than 1, the resulting product will have more than one factor that is greater than 1 and therefore be composite. Additionally, if any of the dice show a 4 or a 6, the product will obviously be composite. So in order for the product to not be composite, we need at least four dice to be a 1 and the fifth die to either be another 1 or a 2, a 3, or a 5.\n\nThere's exactly one way in which all the the dice can be 1's, and for each of the other three cases there are 5 ways since the die that isn't a 1 can appear in any of the 5 other positions, so there are a total of $3\\cdot5+1=16$ ways of rolling the dice that result in a product that isn't composite. Additionally, there are 6 options for the roll of each of the 5 dice for a total of $6^5=7776$ possible outcomes, which means that the probability of the product not being composite is $\\dfrac{16}{7776}$ and the probability that it is composite is $1-\\frac{16}{7776}=\\frac{7760}{7776}=\\boxed{\\frac{485}{486}}$.\n\nNote: Many students have tried to argue that 1 is not a prime number and should not be counted. As we are doing complementary probability, it is important to consider all numbers that are not composite, and 1 is definitely not composite.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the result is a composite number, it's easier to first find the probability that the result is not composite (i.e., it's either prime or 1, since the product of any number of 1s is 1, which is not composite) and then subtract that from 1.\n\n1. **The product can be 1:** This happens if at least four of the dice show a 1 and the remaining die shows a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. There are $\\binom{5}{4} + \\binom{5}{5} = 6$ ways to choose which four dice show a 1 and which die shows a 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n2. **The product is a prime number:** This happens if at least four of the dice show a 1 and the remaining die shows a 2, 3, or 5. There are $\\binom{5}{4} + \\binom{5}{5} = 6$ ways to choose which four dice show a 1 and which die shows a 2, 3, or 5.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of outcomes when rolling 5 dice. Each die has 6 possible outcomes, so there are $6^5$ total possible outcomes.\n\nThe number of ways to get a non-composite product is the sum of the two cases we found: $6 + 6 = 12$. Therefore, the probability that the product is not composite is $\\frac{12}{6^5}$.\n\nTo find the probability that the product is composite, we can subtract the probability that it's not composite from 1:\n\n$$\n1 - \\frac{12}{6^5} = 1 - \\frac{12}{7776} = 1 - \\frac{1}{648} = \\frac{647}{648}\n$$\n\nSo the probability that the result is a composite number is $\\frac{647}{648}$."
