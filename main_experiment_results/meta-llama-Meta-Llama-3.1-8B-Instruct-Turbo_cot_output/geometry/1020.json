    "problem": "In a trapezoid $ABCD$ with $AB$ parallel to $CD$, the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$. If the area of triangle $ABE$ is 50 square units, and the area of triangle $ADE$ is 20 square units, what is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?",
    "solution": "[asy]\nsize(2.5inch);\npair A,B,C,D,E;\nA = (-3,4);\nB = (5,4);\nC = (4,0);\nD = (0,0);\nE = intersectionpoint(A--C, B--D);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle); draw(A--C); draw(B--D);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW); label(\"$B$\", B, NE); label(\"$C$\", C, SE); label(\"$D$\", D, SW); label(\"$E$\", E, N);\n[/asy] We will write the area of triangle $XYZ$ as $[XYZ].$  Since triangles $ADC$ and $BCD$ share a base and have the same altitude length to that base, they have the same area. Since $[BCD] = [ADC]$, we have $[BCE] + [CDE] = [ADE] + [CDE]$, so  $[BCE] = [ADE] = 20$.\n\nTo find the area of triangle $CDE$, we note that triangles $CDE$ and $ABE$ are similar, and the ratio of their sides is $DE/BE$. Triangles $ADE$ and $ABE$ share an altitude, so $DE/BE = [ADE]/[ABE] = 20/50 = 2/5$. Since the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their sides, $[CDE]/[ABE] = (DE/BE)^2 = 4/25$, and $[CDE] = (4/25)[ABE] = (4/25)(50) = 8$. Thus, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $[ABE] + [ADE] + [BCE] + [CDE] = 50+20+20+8 = \\boxed{98}$.",

    "model_solution": "We can solve this problem by using the concept of similar triangles.\n\nFirst, we are given a trapezoid $ABCD$ with $AB$ parallel to $CD$. This means that the ratio of the area of triangle $ABE$ and triangle $ADE$ is equal to the ratio of the heights of triangle $ABE$ and triangle $ADE$.\n\nSince $AB$ is parallel to $CD$, we know that triangles $ADC$ and $ABC$ are similar. This also means that triangle $ADE$ and triangle $ABE$ are similar.\n\nWe can set up a proportion to find the ratio of the areas of triangle $ABE$ and triangle $ADE$.\n\n$\\frac{\\text{area of triangle } ABE}{\\text{area of triangle } ADE} = \\frac{\\text{base of triangle } ABE}{\\text{base of triangle } ADE}$\n\nLet the bases of triangle $ABE$ and triangle $ADE$ be $x$ and $y$ respectively. Then the ratio becomes:\n\n$\\frac{50}{20} = \\frac{x}{y}$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{x}{y}$\n\nNow, let's look at the trapezoid $ABCD$. We can see that triangle $ADE$ and triangle $ABC$ are similar. This means that the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their sides.\n\nLet the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ be $z$. Then the ratio of the areas of triangle $ABC$ and trapezoid $ABCD$ is:\n\n$\\frac{\\text{area of triangle } ABC}{\\text{area of trapezoid } ABCD} = \\frac{(x+y)^2}{2xy}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $x$ in terms of $y$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{5y^2+20y^2}{2(5y)(2y)} = \\frac{25y^2}{20y^2} = \\frac{5}{4}$\n\nNow, let's look at the ratio of the areas of triangle $ADE$ and trapezoid $ABCD$. We can see that:\n\n$\\frac{\\text{area of triangle } ADE}{\\text{area of trapezoid } ABCD} = \\frac{20}{z}$\n\nWe also know that the ratio of the areas of triangle $ADE$ and triangle $ABE$ is:\n\n$\\frac{\\text{area of triangle } ADE}{\\text{area of triangle } ABE} = \\frac{y^2}{x^2} = \\frac{4}{5}$\n\nEquating the two ratios, we get:\n\n$\\frac{20}{z} = \\frac{4}{5}$\n\nSolving for $z$, we get:\n\n$z = \\frac{100}{4} = 25$\n\nTherefore, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $25 \\times 2$ (since the formula for the area of a trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}h(b_1+b_2)$ and in our case $h$ is $2$, $b_1$ is $5y$ and $b_2$ is $20y$), which is $50$."
