    "problem": "A triangle with side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5 is inscribed in a circle of radius 3.  What is the area of the triangle? Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $3x$, $4x$, and $5x$.  The triangle is a right triangle, so its hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle.  Thus $5x=2\\cdot 3=6$, so $x=6/5$.  The area of the triangle is \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3x\\cdot 4x =\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{18}{5}\\cdot \\frac{24}{5}\n=\\frac{216}{25}=\\boxed{8.64}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the actual side lengths of the triangle**: Since the sides are in the ratio 3:4:5, we can think of the sides as 3x, 4x, and 5x. \n2. **Use the fact that the triangle is inscribed in a circle to find x**: The longest side of the triangle (5x) will be the diameter of the circle. Since the radius of the circle is 3, the diameter is 6 (twice the radius).\n\n3. **Solve for x**: Since the diameter of the circle is 6, we can set up the equation:\n   5x = 6\n   x = 6 / 5 = 1.2\n\n4. **Find the actual side lengths of the triangle**: Now that we have the value of x, we can find the side lengths:\n   - Side 1 (3x): 3 * 1.2 = 3.6\n   - Side 2 (4x): 4 * 1.2 = 4.8\n   - Side 3 (5x): 5 * 1.2 = 6 (which we already knew)\n\n5. **Calculate the area of the triangle**: Since this is a right-angled triangle (the sides are in the ratio 3:4:5), we can use the formula:\n   Area = (base * height) / 2\n   Here, the base and height are the two shorter sides (3.6 and 4.8).\n   Area = (3.6 * 4.8) / 2\n   Area = 17.28 / 2\n   Area = 8.64\n\nThe area of the triangle is approximately 8.64."
