    "problem": "A hemisphere-shaped bowl with radius 1 foot is filled full with chocolate.  All of the chocolate is then evenly distributed between 27 congruent, smaller hemisphere-shaped molds.  What is the radius of each of the smaller molds, in feet?",
    "solution": "A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so a hemisphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$.  The large hemisphere-shaped bowl has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi(1^3) = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ cubic feet.\n\nLet each of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds have radius $r$.  Their total volume, in terms of $r$, is $27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$ cubic feet, so we have \\[27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi.\\]Dividing both sides by $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ yields $27r^3 =1$, so $r=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$ feet.",

    "model_solution": "To find the radius of each smaller mold, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the volume of the original hemisphere-shaped bowl:**\n\nThe formula for the volume of a hemisphere is:\n\nV = (2/3)\u03c0r^3\n\nwhere V is the volume and r is the radius. \n\nGiven that the radius of the original bowl is 1 foot, we can plug in the value to find the volume:\n\nV = (2/3)\u03c0(1)^3\nV = (2/3)\u03c0\nV \u2248 2.0944 cubic feet\n\n2. **Find the volume of each smaller mold:**\n\nThe total volume of the original bowl is evenly distributed between 27 smaller molds. So, the volume of each smaller mold is:\n\nV_smaller = V_total / 27\nV_smaller = 2.0944 cubic feet / 27\nV_smaller \u2248 0.0774 cubic feet\n\n3. **Find the radius of each smaller mold:**\n\nNow we know the volume of each smaller mold, we can use the formula for the volume of a hemisphere to find the radius:\n\nV = (2/3)\u03c0r^3\n0.0774 \u2248 (2/3)\u03c0r^3\nr^3 = (0.0774 * 3) / (2 * \u03c0)\nr^3 \u2248 0.117\nr \u2248 \u221b0.117\nr \u2248 0.5 feet\n\nSo, the radius of each of the smaller molds is approximately 0.5 feet."
