    "problem": "A square and a circle intersect so that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle. What is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "Drawing a diagram and adding $OM$ perpendicular to $AD$, we get\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-1,1);\nB=(1,1);\nC=(1,-1);\nD=(-1,-1);\nE=(-1,-.577);\nF=(-1,.577);\nM=(-1,0);\ndraw(circle(O,1.155));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--A);\ndraw(F--O);\ndraw(O--E);\ndraw(O--M);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"F\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, dir(0));\nlabel(\"M\", M, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (F+O)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (E+O)/2, SE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", M, W);\n[/asy] First note that $O$ is not only the center of the circle but also the center of the square since the diagram is symmetric. Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Draw a diagram and label the relevant parts. \n\nLet's call the radius of the circle $r$. The square intersects the circle such that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle. We can draw a diagram and label the relevant parts.\n\nStep 2: Find the length of the side of the square.\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that the side of the square is equal to twice the altitude of one of the triangles formed by the square and the circle.\n\nLet's call the length of the side of the square $s$. \n\nConsider the triangle formed by the square and the circle. The base of this triangle is a side of the square, which is equal to $s$. The height of this triangle is the altitude of the triangle, which we'll call $h$.\n\nWe can see that the altitude $h$ forms a right-angled triangle with the radius of the circle $r$ and half the side of the square, which is $s/2$. This is because the line from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord is perpendicular to the chord.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can write:\n\n\\[ r^2 = h^2 + \\left( \\frac{s}{2} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nWe can simplify this to:\n\n\\[ r^2 = h^2 + \\frac{s^2}{4} \\]\n\nStep 3: Solve for the length of the side of the square.\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for $h$:\n\n\\[ h^2 = r^2 - \\frac{s^2}{4} \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ h = \\sqrt{r^2 - \\frac{s^2}{4}} \\]\n\nNow we can use the fact that the side of the square is equal to twice the altitude of one of the triangles formed by the square and the circle. \n\nSo we can write:\n\n\\[ s = 2h \\]\n\nSubstituting this into the equation above, we get:\n\n\\[ s = 2 \\sqrt{r^2 - \\frac{s^2}{4}} \\]\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ s^2 = 4 \\left( r^2 - \\frac{s^2}{4} \\right) \\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging, we get:\n\n\\[ s^2 = 4r^2 - s^2 \\]\n\nAdding $s^2$ to both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ 2s^2 = 4r^2 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n\\[ s^2 = 2r^2 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ s = \\sqrt{2}r \\]\n\nStep 4: Find the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle.\n\nThe area of the square is $s^2$, which is equal to $2r^2$. \n\nThe area of the circle is $\\pi r^2$.\n\nSo the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2r^2}{\\pi r^2} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$."
