    "problem": "A circle centered at $O$ is circumscribed about $\\triangle ABC$ as follows: [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pO;\npO = (0, 0);\npA = pO + dir(-20);\npB = pO + dir(90);\npC = pO + dir(190);\ndraw(pA--pB--pC--pA);\ndraw(pO--pA);\ndraw(pO--pB);\ndraw(pO--pC);\nlabel(\"$O$\", pO, S);\nlabel(\"$110^\\circ$\", pO, NE);\nlabel(\"$100^\\circ$\", pO, NW);\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, SE);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, N);\nlabel(\"$C$\", pC, SW);\ndraw(circle(pO, 1));\n[/asy] What is the measure of $\\angle BAC$, in degrees?",
    "solution": "We can see that $\\angle AOC = 360^\\circ - (110^\\circ + 100^\\circ) = 150^\\circ.$ Now, $\\triangle AOC$ and $\\triangle AOB$ are both isosceles triangles. That means that $\\angle OAC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (180^\\circ - 150^\\circ) = 15^\\circ$ and $\\angle OAB = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (180^\\circ - 110^\\circ) = 35^\\circ.$  Therefore, our answer is $\\angle BAC = \\angle OAB + \\angle OAC = 15^\\circ + 35^\\circ = \\boxed{50^\\circ}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the measure of $\\angle BAC$, we can use the fact that the angle subtended by an arc at the center of a circle is twice the angle subtended by the same arc at the circumference.\n\nLet's consider the arcs $AB$ and $BC$. The angle at the center of the circle, subtended by arc $AB$, is $110^\\circ$. The angle at the center of the circle, subtended by arc $BC$, is $100^\\circ$. \n\nSince the angle at the circumference is half the angle at the center, the angle subtended by arc $AB$ at the circumference is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 110^\\circ = 55^\\circ$. Similarly, the angle subtended by arc $BC$ at the circumference is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 100^\\circ = 50^\\circ$.\n\nSince $\\angle BAC$ is the angle formed by the intersection of the chords $AB$ and $BC$, it is equal to half the difference of the angles subtended by the arcs at the circumference. \n\nTherefore, $\\angle BAC = \\frac{1}{2} (55^\\circ - 50^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5^\\circ = 2.5^\\circ$."
