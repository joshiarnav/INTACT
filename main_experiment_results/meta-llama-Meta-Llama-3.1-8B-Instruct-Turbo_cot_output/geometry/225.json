    "problem": "Jimmy owns a cube-shaped container that measures $10$ inches on each side. He fills this container with water until it is half full. Then he throws ten giant ice cubes that measure $2$ inches on each side into the container. In inches cubed, how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water?",
    "solution": "First let's compute the volume of the container. The container measures $10\\times10\\times10$ so its volume is  $$10\\cdot10\\cdot10=10^3=1000$$inches cubed. Since the container is only half full, there are $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10^3=500$$inches cubed of water in it. Additionally, there are ten ice cubes each with a volume of $2^3$. This means that the total volume of the ice cubes is $$10\\cdot2^3=10\\cdot8=80.$$Altogether, the water and the ice cubes occupy $500+80=580$ inches cubed. This means that there are $1000-580=\\boxed{420}$ inches cubed of space in the container unoccupied by water and ice.",

    "model_solution": "To find out how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water, we need to first calculate the total volume of the container, the volume of the water, and the volume of the ice. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the total volume of the container.\nThe container is a cube with side length 10 inches. The formula to calculate the volume of a cube is side^3.\nTotal Volume = 10^3 = 1000 cubic inches.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the volume of the water in the container.\nThe container is filled with water until it is half full. So, the volume of the water will be half of the total volume of the container.\nVolume of Water = (1000 / 2) = 500 cubic inches.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the volume of a single giant ice cube.\nEach ice cube is a cube with a side length of 2 inches. \nVolume of a Single Ice Cube = 2^3 = 8 cubic inches.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total volume of the 10 giant ice cubes.\nSince there are 10 ice cubes, we need to multiply the volume of a single ice cube by 10.\nTotal Volume of Ice Cubes = 10 * 8 = 80 cubic inches.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total occupied volume in the container.\nThis includes both the water and the ice.\nTotal Occupied Volume = Volume of Water + Total Volume of Ice Cubes = 500 + 80 = 580 cubic inches.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the unoccupied volume in the container.\nThis is the total volume of the container minus the total occupied volume.\nUnoccupied Volume = Total Volume - Total Occupied Volume = 1000 - 580 = 420 cubic inches.\n\nTherefore, 420 cubic inches of the container is unoccupied by ice or water."
