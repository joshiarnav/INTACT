    "problem": "The radius of a cylinder is doubled and its height is tripled. If its original volume was 10 cubic feet, what is its volume now, in cubic feet?",
    "solution": "Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively.  The new cylinder has volume \\[\n\\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\\pi r^2 h,\n\\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume.  Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of the cylinder after the radius is doubled and the height is tripled, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The original volume of the cylinder is given by the formula V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Let's call the original radius r and the original height h.\n\n2. The original volume is given as 10 cubic feet, so we can write: \u03c0r\u00b2h = 10.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the changes. The radius is doubled, so the new radius is 2r. The height is tripled, so the new height is 3h.\n\n4. The new volume can be calculated using the same formula: V = \u03c0(2r)\u00b2(3h).\n\n5. Simplify the formula: V = \u03c0(4r\u00b2)(3h) = 12\u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\n6. Now, we can substitute the original volume equation into this new equation: V = 12\u03c0r\u00b2h = 12(\u03c0r\u00b2h).\n\n7. Since \u03c0r\u00b2h = 10 (from step 2), we can substitute this value in: V = 12(10) = 120.\n\nSo, the new volume of the cylinder is 120 cubic feet."
