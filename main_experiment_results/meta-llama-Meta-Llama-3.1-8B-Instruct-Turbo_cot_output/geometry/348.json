    "solution": "To start, we can draw in a line from where the altitude meets the base to one of the bottom corners as shown:\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(13,3)--(10,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(6.5,15)--(3,3),linewidth(1));\ndraw((13,3)--(6.5,15)--(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,15)--(6.5,1.5),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,1.5)--(10,0),linewidth(.7));\n[/asy]\n\nThe length of this segment will be half the length of the diagonal of the base.  The base has side $10$, so the diagonal will satisfy: $$d^2=10^2+10^2=200$$ $$d=10\\sqrt{2}$$ Half of this is $5\\sqrt{2}$.  Now we can look at the right triangle formed by the altitude from the vertex of the pyramid, the line just drawn in, and with hypotenuse as the edge we need to find the length of.  The length of this edge is: $$\\sqrt{12^2+(5\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{144+50}=\\sqrt{194}\\approx 13.928$$ The total length of all edges is: $$4(10)+4(13.928)\\approx \\boxed{ 96}$$",

    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the lengths of the pyramid's eight edges, we first need to find the lengths of the edges on the base and the lengths of the slant edges.\n\n1. The base of the pyramid is a square with 10 cm sides. To find the sum of the lengths of the base edges, we multiply the side length by 4 since there are 4 base edges.\n   The sum of the base edges = 4 * 10 cm = 40 cm.\n\n2. Now, we need to find the length of the slant edges. To do this, we can visualize a right-angled triangle formed by the slant edge, the height from the center of the base to the peak (12 cm), and the distance from the center of the base to one of its corners. Since the base is a square, the distance from the center to one of its corners is half the length of the diagonal of the base.\n\n   The diagonal of the base can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   Diagonal = sqrt(side^2 + side^2) = sqrt(10^2 + 10^2) = sqrt(200) cm\n\n   The distance from the center to one of its corners is half the diagonal:\n   Distance = sqrt(200) / 2 cm.\n\n   Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the slant edge (hypotenuse):\n   Length of slant edge = sqrt((sqrt(200) / 2)^2 + 12^2) \n   = sqrt(50 + 144) \n   = sqrt(194) cm\n   (This is approximately 13.928 cm)\n\n3. There are 4 slant edges in the pyramid, so we multiply the length of one slant edge by 4 to find the sum of the lengths of all 4 slant edges:\n   Sum of the lengths of the slant edges = 4 * sqrt(194) \n   (This is approximately 55.712 cm)\n\n4. To find the sum of the lengths of all 8 edges, we add the sum of the base edges and the sum of the slant edges:\n   Sum of the lengths of all 8 edges = Sum of the base edges + Sum of the slant edges \n   = 40 cm + 55.712 cm \n   = 95.712 cm\n\n   Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get:\n   Sum of the lengths of all 8 edges \u2248 96 cm."
