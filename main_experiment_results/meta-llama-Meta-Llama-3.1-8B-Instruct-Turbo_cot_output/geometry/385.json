    "problem": "What is the volume in cubic inches of a right, rectangular prism with side, front and bottom faces having an area 15 square inches, 10 square inches and 6 square inches, respectively?",
    "solution": "Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of the rectangular prism, we need to understand that the area of each face is related to the dimensions of the prism. \n\nLet's denote the length, width, and height of the prism as l, w, and h, respectively.\n\nThe area of the side face is lw = 15 square inches.\nThe area of the front face is lh = 10 square inches.\nThe area of the bottom face is wh = 6 square inches.\n\nWe can multiply all three equations together to get (lw)(lh)(wh) = 15 * 10 * 6.\nThis simplifies to (lwh)^2 = 900 square inches (since volume is lwh).\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get lwh = \u221a900 = 30 cubic inches.\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular prism is 30 cubic inches."
