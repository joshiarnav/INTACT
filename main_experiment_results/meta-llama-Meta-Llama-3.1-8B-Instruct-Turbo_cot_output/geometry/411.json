    "model_solution": "To find the area of the square $BCFE$, we can use the properties of right triangles and similar triangles.\n\nStep 1: \nThe problem involves a right triangle $AGD$ with a square $BCFE$ inscribed in it. We are given the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$ as $28$ units and $58$ units, respectively.\n\nStep 2: \nSince the square is inscribed in the triangle, we can see that the side length of the square is the same as the side length of the smaller triangle $\\triangle ABE$ and the larger triangle $\\triangle FCD$. Let's call the side length of the square $x$. Then, the area of the square is $x^2$.\n\nStep 3: \nTo find the side length of the square, we can look at the two similar triangles $\\triangle AEB$ and $\\triangle FDC$. Since they are similar, we can set up a proportion to relate their side lengths.\n\nStep 4: \nThe ratio of the side lengths of the two triangles is equal to the ratio of their corresponding sides. The ratio of $AB$ to $x$ is equal to the ratio of $x$ to $CD$.\n\nStep 5: \nWe can write the proportion as:\n\n$$\\frac{AB}{x} = \\frac{x}{CD}$$\n\nStep 6: \nTo solve for $x$, we can cross-multiply:\n\n$$AB \\cdot CD = x^2$$\n\nStep 7: \nNow, we can plug in the given values for $AB$ and $CD$ and solve for $x^2$, which is the area of the square.\n\n$$x^2 = AB \\cdot CD$$\n$$x^2 = 28 \\cdot 58$$\n$$x^2 = 1624$$\n\nStep 8: \nTherefore, the area of the square $BCFE$ is $1624$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1624}$"
