    "problem": "In triangle $ABC$, we have that $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of sides $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{AB}$, respectively. The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is 24 square units. How many square units are in the area of $\\triangle CEF$?",
    "solution": "We first draw a diagram: [asy]\npair A, B, C, E, F;\nA = (0, 4);\nB = (-3, 0);\nC = (7, 0);\nE = 0.5 * A + 0.5 * C;\nF = 0.5 * A + 0.5 * B;\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--E--F--cycle);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\n[/asy] Since $F$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, the area of $\\triangle AFC$ is half of the area of $\\triangle ABC,$ or 12 square units. Following the same reasoning, we see that $E$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AC},$ so the area of $\\triangle CEF$ is half that of $\\triangle AFC,$ or $\\boxed{6}$ square units.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of $\\triangle CEF$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Recall the property of midpoints**: When midpoints $E$ and $F$ are connected, they create a line segment that is parallel to the base of the original triangle and half its length.\n\n2. **Create a line segment connecting $E$ and $F$**: Let's call this line segment $EF$. By the midpoint theorem, $EF$ is parallel to $AB$ and half its length.\n\n3. **Determine the ratio of areas**: The area of a triangle formed by connecting midpoints is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the area of the original triangle. This is because the base of the smaller triangle is half the base of the larger triangle and the height of the smaller triangle is half the height of the larger triangle.\n\n4. **Calculate the area of $\\triangle CEF$**: Given that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is 24 square units, the area of $\\triangle CEF$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of 24 square units.\n\n5. **Find the area of $\\triangle CEF$**: \nArea of $\\triangle CEF$ = $\\frac{1}{4}$ $\\times$ Area of $\\triangle ABC$\n= $\\frac{1}{4}$ $\\times$ 24 square units\n= 6 square units\n\nTherefore, the area of $\\triangle CEF$ is 6 square units."
