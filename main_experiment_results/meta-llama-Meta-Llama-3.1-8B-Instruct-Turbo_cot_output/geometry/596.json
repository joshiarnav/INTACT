    "problem": "Point $P$ is inside equilateral $\\triangle ABC$.  Points $Q$, $R$, and $S$ are the feet of the perpendiculars from $P$ to $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{CA}$, respectively. Given that $PQ=1$, $PR=2$, and $PS=3$, what is $AB$ in terms of radicals?",
    "solution": "Let the side length of $\\triangle ABC$ be $s$. Then the areas of $\\triangle APB$, $\\triangle BPC$, and $\\triangle CPA$ are, respectively, $s/2$, $s$, and $3s/2$.  The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is the sum of these, which is $3s$.  The area of $\\triangle ABC$ may also be expressed as $(\\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$, so $3s = (\\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$. The unique positive solution for $s$ is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle and the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle.\n\nStep 1: Recall that in a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the lengths of the sides opposite the angles is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$. The length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle is 1, the length of the side opposite the 60-degree angle is $\\sqrt{3}$, and the length of the hypotenuse is 2.\n\nStep 2: Since $P$ is inside the equilateral triangle $\\triangle ABC$, the perpendiculars from $P$ to the sides of the triangle divide it into three smaller triangles, each of which is a 30-60-90 triangle.\n\nStep 3: The area of an equilateral triangle is given by the formula $Area = \\frac{s^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$, where $s$ is the length of a side.\n\nStep 4: We can also find the area of the equilateral triangle by summing the areas of the three smaller triangles. Each of these triangles has a base equal to the length of one of the sides of the equilateral triangle, and a height equal to the length of the altitude from $P$ to that side.\n\nStep 5: The area of the triangle with base $AB$ and height $PQ$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(AB)(PQ)$.\n\nStep 6: The area of the triangle with base $BC$ and height $PR$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(BC)(PR)$.\n\nStep 7: The area of the triangle with base $CA$ and height $PS$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(CA)(PS)$.\n\nStep 8: Since the three smaller triangles together make up the entire equilateral triangle, their areas add up to the area of the equilateral triangle.\n\nStep 9: We can set up an equation using the areas of the three smaller triangles and the area of the equilateral triangle.\n\nStep 10: The equation is $\\frac{1}{2}(AB)(PQ) + \\frac{1}{2}(BC)(PR) + \\frac{1}{2}(CA)(PS) = \\frac{AB^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n\nStep 11: We can simplify this equation by substituting the given values for $PQ$, $PR$, and $PS$, which are 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\nStep 12: Substituting these values, we obtain $\\frac{1}{2}(AB)(1) + \\frac{1}{2}(BC)(2) + \\frac{1}{2}(CA)(3) = \\frac{AB^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n\nStep 13: Since $\\triangle ABC$ is an equilateral triangle, all its sides are equal. We can substitute $AB$ for $BC$ and $CA$ in the equation.\n\nStep 14: The equation becomes $\\frac{1}{2}(AB)(1) + \\frac{1}{2}(AB)(2) + \\frac{1}{2}(AB)(3) = \\frac{AB^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n\nStep 15: Simplifying this equation, we obtain $\\frac{1}{2}(AB)(6) = \\frac{AB^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n\nStep 16: Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we obtain $6(AB) = \\frac{AB^2\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nStep 17: Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we obtain $12(AB) = AB^2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nStep 18: Dividing both sides by $AB$ to eliminate the variable from one side of the equation, we obtain $12 = AB\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nStep 19: To isolate $AB$, we need to divide both sides by $\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nStep 20: The equation is $AB = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nStep 21: To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nStep 22: The equation becomes $AB = \\frac{12\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nStep 23: Simplifying the denominator, we obtain $AB = \\frac{12\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\n\nStep 24: Simplifying the expression, we obtain $AB = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nThe final answer is 4\u221a3."
