Now, we have a regular tetrahedron $EFGH$, which by symmetry has twice the volume of our original solid. This tetrahedron has side length $2s = 12\\sqrt{2}$. Using the formula for the volume of a regular tetrahedron, which is $V = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}S^3}{12}$, where S is the side length of the tetrahedron, the volume of our original solid is:\n$V = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot (12\\sqrt{2})^3}{12} = \\boxed{288}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of the given solid, we need to break it down into simpler shapes. \n\n**Step 1: Identify the shape of the base**\nThe base of the solid is a square with side length $s$. \n\n**Step 2: Identify the shape of the upper edge**\nThe upper edge is parallel to the base and has length $2s$. It forms a square with the base when connected.\n\n**Step 3: Find the height of the solid**\nTo find the height, we need to consider the triangular faces of the solid. The triangular faces $ADE$ and $BDF$ are isosceles right triangles, as $AD = DE = s$ and $BD = DF = s$. Therefore, the height $h$ of the solid can be found by considering right triangle $ADE$. The legs of the triangle are both $s/2$, and the hypotenuse $AD = s$.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem: \n\n$h^2 + (s/2)^2 = s^2$\n$h^2 + s^2/4 = s^2$\n$h^2 = s^2 - s^2/4$\n$h^2 = 3s^2/4$\n$h = \\sqrt{3}s^2/2$\n\nHowever, the height can be more easily found by realizing that we are dealing with a square pyramid with base side length $s$ and slant height $\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}$, therefore the height of the pyramid is $\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}$. \n\nUsing this fact we can find $h$:\n$h = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n**Step 4: Find the area of the base**\nThe base of the solid is a square with side length $s$. The area of the base, $A_b$, is:\n\n$A_b = s^2$\n\n**Step 5: Find the volume of the solid**\nTo find the volume, we can use the formula for the volume of a pyramid:\n\n$V = \\frac{1}{3}bh$\n\nIn this case, the base area is $s^2$ and the height is $\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}$. \n\n$V = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot s^2 \\cdot \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the given value of $s$ and simplify**\nGiven that $s = 6\\sqrt{2}$, we can substitute this value into the expression for volume:\n\n$V = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (6\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot \\frac{6\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n$V = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 72 \\cdot 6$\n\n$V = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 432$\n\n$V = 144$\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid is $144$."
