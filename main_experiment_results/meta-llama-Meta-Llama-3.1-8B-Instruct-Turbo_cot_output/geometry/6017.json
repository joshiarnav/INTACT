    "problem": "Rhombus $PQRS$ is inscribed in rectangle $ABCD$ so that vertices $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$ are interior points on sides $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{BC}$, $\\overline{CD}$, and $\\overline{DA}$, respectively.

    "solution": "[asy]defaultpen(fontsize(10)+linewidth(0.65)); pair A=(0,28.8), B=(38.4,28.8), C=(38.4,0), D=(0,0), O, P=(23.4,28.8), Q=(38.4,8.8), R=(15,0), S=(0,20); O=intersectionpoint(A--C,B--D); draw(A--B--C--D--cycle);draw(P--R..Q--S); draw(P--Q--R--S--cycle); label(\"\\(A\\)\",A,NW);label(\"\\(B\\)\",B,NE);label(\"\\(C\\)\",C,SE);label(\"\\(D\\)\",D,SW); label(\"\\(P\\)\",P,N);label(\"\\(Q\\)\",Q,E);label(\"\\(R\\)\",R,SW);label(\"\\(S\\)\",S,W); label(\"\\(15\\)\",B/2+P/2,N);label(\"\\(20\\)\",B/2+Q/2,E);label(\"\\(O\\)\",O,SW); [/asy]\nLet $O$ be the center of the rhombus. Via parallel sides and alternate interior angles, we see that the opposite triangles are congruent ($\\triangle BPQ \\cong \\triangle DRS$, $\\triangle APS \\cong \\triangle CRQ$). Quickly we realize that $O$ is also the center of the rectangle.\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, we can solve for a side of the rhombus; $PQ = \\sqrt{15^2 + 20^2} = 25$. Since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors, we have that $OP = 15, OQ = 20$. Also, $\\angle POQ = 90^{\\circ}$, so quadrilateral $BPOQ$ is cyclic. By Ptolemy's Theorem, $25 \\cdot OB = 20 \\cdot 15 + 15 \\cdot 20 = 600$.\nBy similar logic, we have $APOS$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. Let $AP = x$, $AS = y$. The Pythagorean Theorem gives us $x^2 + y^2 = 625\\quad \\mathrm{(1)}$. Ptolemy\u2019s Theorem gives us $25 \\cdot OA = 20x + 15y$. Since the diagonals of a rectangle are equal, $OA = \\frac{1}{2}d = OB$, and $20x + 15y = 600\\quad \\mathrm{(2)}$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = 40 - \\frac 43x$. Substituting into $\\mathrm{(1)}$,\n\\begin{eqnarray*}x^2 + \\left(40-\\frac 43x\\right)^2 &=& 625\\\\ 5x^2 - 192x + 1755 &=& 0\\\\ x = \\frac{192 \\pm \\sqrt{192^2 - 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 1755}}{10} &=& 15, \\frac{117}{5}\\end{eqnarray*}\nWe reject $15$ because then everything degenerates into squares, but the condition that $PR \\neq QS$ gives us a contradiction. Thus $x = \\frac{117}{5}$, and backwards solving gives $y = \\frac{44}5$. The perimeter of $ABCD$ is $2\\left(20 + 15 + \\frac{117}{5} + \\frac{44}5\\right) = \\frac{672}{5}$, and $m + n = \\boxed{677}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the perimeter of the rectangle $ABCD$, we need to find the lengths of its sides.\n\nSince $PQRS$ is a rhombus, all its sides are equal. Let's denote the side length of the rhombus as $x$. \n\nWe know that $PB = 15$ and $PR = 30$. This implies that the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at their midpoints. This is because the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other. \n\nLet's denote the intersection point of the diagonals as $O$. \n\nSince $PB = 15$ and $PR = 30$, we can conclude that $OR = 15$ (because $PR$ is the diagonal of the rhombus, and $OR$ is half of it).\n\nSimilarly, $QS = 40$ and $BQ = 20$. This implies that $OQ = 20$. \n\nNow, we have a rectangle with side lengths $OR = 15$ and $OQ = 20$. This is because the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, and $OR$ and $OQ$ are half of the diagonals.\n\nWe can find the side lengths of the rectangle $ABCD$ by adding the side lengths of the rhombus. \n\nLet's find the side lengths of the rectangle $ABCD$:\n\n- The length of side $AB$ is $PR + BQ = 30 + 20 = 50$.\n- The length of side $BC$ is $BQ + QS = 20 + 40 = 60$.\n- The length of side $CD$ is $PR + PB = 30 + 15 = 45$.\n- The length of side $DA$ is $QS + PB = 40 + 15 = 55$.\n\nHowever, there's an easier way to find the side lengths of the rectangle $ABCD$. \n\nSince $PQRS$ is a rhombus, the diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. \n\nThis implies that the diagonals of the rectangle $ABCD$ are also perpendicular bisectors of each other. \n\nLet's denote the intersection point of the diagonals of the rectangle $ABCD$ as $O$. \n\nWe can find the side lengths of the rectangle $ABCD$ by using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n- The length of side $AB$ is equal to $\\sqrt{(PR)^2 + (PB)^2} = \\sqrt{30^2 + 15^2} = \\sqrt{900 + 225} = \\sqrt{1125} = 15\\sqrt{5}$.\n- The length of side $BC$ is equal to $\\sqrt{(BQ)^2 + (QS)^2} = \\sqrt{20^2 + 40^2} = \\sqrt{400 + 1600} = \\sqrt{2000} = 10\\sqrt{5} \\times 2 = 20\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nHowever, after reevaluating the work above, I found what we need to do is use $BC = 60$ and $AB = 50$. We can use $AB = 50$ and $BC = 60$ to find the perimeter of the rectangle $ABCD$.\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle $ABCD$ is $2 \\times (length + width) = 2 \\times (50 + 60) = 2 \\times 110 = 220$. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is $m + n = 220 + 1 = 221$."
