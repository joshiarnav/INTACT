By the Two Tangent Theorem, $AP = AQ = 23$, $BP = BR = 27$, and $CQ = CR = x$. Using $rs = A$, where $s = \\frac{27 \\cdot 2 + 23 \\cdot 2 + x \\cdot 2}{2} = 50 + x$, we get $(21)(50 + x) = A$. By Heron's formula, $A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{(50+x)(x)(23)(27)}$. Equating and squaring both sides,\n\\begin{eqnarray*}  [21(50+x)]^2 &=& (50+x)(x)(621)\\\\ 441(50+x) &=& 621x\\\\ 180x = 441 \\cdot 50 &\\Longrightarrow & x = \\frac{245}{2}   \\end{eqnarray*}\nWe want the perimeter, which is $2s = 2\\left(50 + \\frac{245}{2}\\right) = \\boxed{345}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the perimeter of triangle $ABC$, we need to first understand the properties of the inscribed circle and how it relates to the sides of the triangle.\n\nSince the inscribed circle is tangent to $\\overline{AB}$ at $P$, we know that $\\overline{AP}$ and $\\overline{PB}$ are tangent to the circle at $P$. This means that the radius of the circle is perpendicular to both $\\overline{AP}$ and $\\overline{PB}$.\n\nGiven that the radius of the circle is $21$, we know that $P$ is the midpoint of the line segment connecting the points of tangency of the circle with $\\overline{AB}$. \n\nNow, let's denote the point of tangency of the circle with $\\overline{AC}$ as $Q$ and the point of tangency of the circle with $\\overline{BC}$ as $R$. \n\nSince the radius of the circle is perpendicular to $\\overline{AP}$ and $\\overline{PB}$, we know that $AQ$ and $AR$ are also perpendicular to the radius of the circle.\n\nLet's denote the center of the inscribed circle as $O$. Since the radius of the circle is $21$, we know that $OQ = OR = 21$.\n\nNow, let's draw a line from $A$ to $O$ and a line from $B$ to $O$. These lines intersect at point $O$.\n\nSince $OQ$ and $OR$ are radii of the inscribed circle, we know that $AO$ and $BO$ are perpendicular to $OQ$ and $OR$ respectively.\n\nNow, let's denote the point of intersection of $\\overline{BO}$ and $\\overline{AC}$ as $S$. Since $AS$ and $BO$ are perpendicular to $OQ$ and $OR$ respectively, we know that $S$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$.\n\nSince $AS$ is perpendicular to $OQ$, we know that $AS$ is also perpendicular to $\\overline{AP}$. This means that $\\triangle APS$ is a right triangle with $\\angle APS = 90^\\circ$.\n\nSimilarly, since $BS$ is perpendicular to $OR$, we know that $BS$ is also perpendicular to $\\overline{PB}$. This means that $\\triangle BPS$ is a right triangle with $\\angle BPS = 90^\\circ$.\n\nNow, let's denote the length of $\\overline{AP}$ as $x$. Then, the length of $\\overline{PB}$ is $27$, and the length of $\\overline{AS}$ is $x - 23$.\n\nSince $\\triangle APS$ is a right triangle, we know that the length of $\\overline{PS}$ is equal to the radius of the circle, which is $21$. This means that:\n\n$\\sqrt{(x-23)^2 + (x-23-27)^2} = 21$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$(x-23)^2 + (x-50)^2 = 441$\n\nExpanding this equation, we get:\n\n$x^2 - 46x + 529 + x^2 - 100x + 2500 = 441$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$2x^2 - 146x + 2688 = 441$\n\n$2x^2 - 146x + 2247 = 0$\n\nDivide the equation by 2:\n\n$x^2 - 73x + 1123.5 = 0$\n\nSince this is a quadratic equation, we can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula. \n\nHowever, this equation seems difficult to solve. Instead, we can make use of the fact that the radius of the circle is tangent to $\\overline{AP}$ and $\\overline{PB}$.\n\nSince the radius of the circle is tangent to $\\overline{AP}$ and $\\overline{PB}$, we know that the length of $\\overline{AP}$ and $\\overline{PB}$ plus the radius of the circle is equal to the length of the segments between the points of tangency and the vertices of the triangle.\n\nLet's denote the length of $\\overline{AM}$ as $x$. Then, the length of $\\overline{PB}$ is $27$, and the length of $\\overline{PM}$ is $21$. Since the radius of the circle is tangent to $\\overline{PB}$, we know that the length of $\\overline{PM}$ is equal to the radius of the circle.\n\nSince the length of $\\overline{PM}$ is $21$, we know that the length of $\\overline{BM}$ is $x - 23 + 21 = x - 2$.\n\nSince the radius of the circle is tangent to $\\overline{AB}$, we know that the length of $\\overline{BM}$ is equal to the length of $\\overline{AM}$, which is $x$. This means that:\n\n$x - 2 = x$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$- 2 = 0$\n\nThis equation is not possible, so let's reconsider the previous step.\n\nLet's denote the length of $\\overline{AM}$ as $x$. Then, the length of $\\overline{PB}$ is $27$, and the length of $\\overline{PM}$ is $21$. Since the radius of the circle is tangent to $\\overline{PB}$, we know that the length of $\\overline{PM}$ is equal to the radius of the circle.\n\nSince the length of $\\overline{PM}$ is $21$, we know that the length of $\\overline{BM}$ is $x - 23 + 21 = x - 2$.\n\nSince the radius of the circle is tangent to $\\overline{AB}$, we know that the length of $\\overline{BM}$ is equal to the length of $\\overline{PM}$ minus the length of $\\overline{AP}$. This means that:\n\n$x - 2 = 21 - 23$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$x - 2 = -2$\n\nAdding 2 to both sides of the equation:\n\n$x = 0$\n\nThis equation is not possible, so let's reconsider the previous step.\n\nLet's denote the length of $\\overline{AM}$ as $x$.

This means that:\n\n$x - 2 = 21 - (x - 23)$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$x - 2 = 44 - x$\n\nAdding $x$ to both sides of the equation:\n\n$2x - 2 = 44$\n\nAdding 2 to both sides of the equation:\n\n$2x = 46$\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n$x = 23$\n\nThis is the length of $\\overline{AP}$.\n\nNow, let's find the length of $\\overline{AC}$. Since $AS$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$, we know that the length of $\\overline{AS}$ is half of the length of $\\overline{AC}$. Since the length of $\\overline{AS}$ is $x - 23 = 0$, we know that the length of $\\overline{AC}$ is $2(x - 23) = 2(0) = 0$.\n\nThis is not possible, as the length of $\\overline{AC}$ cannot be zero.\n\nLet's reconsider the previous step.\n\nSince $AS$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$, we know that the length of $\\overline{AS}$ is half of the length of $\\overline{AC}$.
