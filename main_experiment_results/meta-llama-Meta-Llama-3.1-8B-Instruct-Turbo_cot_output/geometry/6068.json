    "problem": "Let $ABCD$ and $BCFG$ be two faces of a cube with $AB=12$. A beam of light emanates from vertex $A$ and reflects off face $BCFG$ at point $P$, which is 7 units from $\\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\\overline{BC}$. The beam continues to be reflected off the faces of the cube. The length of the light path from the time it leaves point $A$ until it next reaches a vertex of the cube is given by $m\\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n$.\n",
    "solution": "When a light beam reflects off a surface, the path is like that of a ball bouncing. Picture that, and also imagine X, Y, and Z coordinates for the cube vertices. The coordinates will all involve 0's and 12's only, so that means that the X, Y, and Z distance traveled by the light must all be divisible by 12. Since the light's Y changes by 5 and the X changes by 7 (the Z changes by 12, don't worry about that), and 5 and 7 are relatively prime to 12, the light must make 12 reflections onto the XY plane or the face parallel to the XY plane.\nIn each reflection, the distance traveled by the light is $\\sqrt{ (12^2) + (5^2) + (7^2) }$ = $\\sqrt{218}$. This happens 12 times, so the total distance is $12\\sqrt{218}$. $m=12$ and $n=218$, so therefore, the answer is $m+n=\\boxed{230}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will first visualize the cube and the path of the light beam. We will then use geometry to find the distance traveled by the light beam until it reaches a vertex of the cube.\n\n1. **Visualizing the cube and the light beam's path:**\n\n   The cube has side length 12, and the light beam starts at vertex $A$. The beam reflects off face $BCFG$ at point $P$, which is 7 units from $\\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\\overline{BC}$. This means that point $P$ is located at $(7,5,0)$, since it is 7 units from $\\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\\overline{BC}$.\n\n   Since the beam is reflecting off a face, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. We can use this information to find the path of the light beam.\n\n2. **Finding the coordinates of point $Q$:**\n\n   The light beam reflects off face $BCFG$ at point $P(7,5,0)$ and continues to be reflected off the faces of the cube. The beam will next reflect off face $ADCB$ at point $Q(7,5,12)$. The coordinates of point $Q$ can be calculated by adding 12 to the z-coordinate of point $P$.\n\n3. **Finding the distance traveled by the light beam:**\n\n   To find the distance traveled by the light beam from point $A$ to point $Q$, we can use the distance formula in three dimensions:\n\n   \\begin{align*}\nd(AQ)&=\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2} \\\\\n&=\\sqrt{(7-0)^2+(5-0)^2+(12-0)^2} \\\\\n&=\\sqrt{49+25+144} \\\\\n&=\\sqrt{218}\n\\end{align*}\n\n   Therefore, the length of the light path from the time it leaves point $A$ until it next reaches a vertex of the cube is $\\sqrt{218}$.\n\n4. **Finding $m$ and $n$:**\n\n   We are given that the length of the light path is $m\\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Comparing this with our result, we have $m=1$ and $n=218$.\n\n5. **Finding $m+n$:**\n\n   Finally, we can find $m+n$ by adding the values of $m$ and $n$:\n\n   \\begin{align*}\nm+n&=1+218 \\\\\n&=219\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{219}$."
