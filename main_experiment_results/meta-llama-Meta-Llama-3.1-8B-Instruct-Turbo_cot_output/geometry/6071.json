    "problem": "Circles $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ intersect at two points, one of which is $(9,6)$, and the product of the radii is $68$. The x-axis and the line $y = mx$, where $m > 0$, are tangent to both circles. It is given that $m$ can be written in the form $a\\sqrt {b}/c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, and $a$ and $c$ are relatively prime. Find $a + b + c$.\n",
    "solution": "Let the smaller angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$ be $\\theta$. Note that the centers of the two circles lie on the angle bisector of the angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$. Also note that if $(x,y)$ is on said angle bisector, we have that $\\frac{y}{x}=\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}$. Let $\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=m_1$, for convenience. Therefore if $(x,y)$ is on the angle bisector, then $x=\\frac{y}{m_1}$. Now let the centers of the two relevant circles be $(a/m_1 , a)$ and $(b/m_1 , b)$ for some positive reals $a$ and $b$. These two circles are tangent to the $x$-axis, so the radii of the circles are $a$ and $b$ respectively. We know that the point $(9,6)$ is a point on both circles, so we have that\n\\[(9-\\frac{a}{m_1})^2+(6-a)^2=a^2\\]\n\\[(9-\\frac{b}{m_1})^2+(6-b)^2=b^2\\]\nExpanding these and manipulating terms gives\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}a^2-[(18/m_1)+12]a+117=0\\]\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}b^2-[(18/m_1)+12]b+117=0\\]\nIt follows that $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the quadratic\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}x^2-[(18/m_1)+12]x+117=0\\]\nIt follows from Vieta's Formulas that the product of the roots of this quadratic is $117m_1^2$, but we were also given that the product of the radii was 68. Therefore $68=117m_1^2$, or $m_1^2=\\frac{68}{117}$. Note that the half-angle formula for tangents is\n\\[\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\cos{\\theta}}{1+\\cos{\\theta}}}\\]\nTherefore\n\\[\\frac{68}{117}=\\frac{1-\\cos{\\theta}}{1+\\cos{\\theta}}\\]\nSolving for $\\cos{\\theta}$ gives that $\\cos{\\theta}=\\frac{49}{185}$. It then follows that $\\sin{\\theta}=\\sqrt{1-\\cos^2{\\theta}}=\\frac{12\\sqrt{221}}{185}$.\nIt then follows that $m=\\tan{\\theta}=\\frac{12\\sqrt{221}}{49}$. Therefore $a=12$, $b=221$, and $c=49$. The desired answer is then $12+221+49=\\boxed{282}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps:\n\nStep 1: Define the centers of the circles\nLet the center of circle $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ be $(x_{1},y_{1})$ and the center of circle $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ be $(x_{2},y_{2})$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the line $y = mx$ intersects the circles at points above the x-axis.\n\nStep 2: Determine the slopes of the tangent lines\nSince the x-axis and the line $y = mx$ are tangent to both circles, the lines connecting the centers of the circles to the points of tangency have the same slope as the tangent lines. The slope of the x-axis is 0, so the slope of the line connecting the center of $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ to the point of tangency with the x-axis is also 0. The slope of the line connecting the center of $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ to the point of tangency with the line $y = mx$ is $m$.\n\nStep 3: Write the equations of the tangent lines\nWe can write the equation of the tangent line to circle $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ with respect to the x-axis as $x = x_{1}$ and the equation of the tangent line to circle $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ with respect to the line $y = mx$ as $y = mx_{2}$.\n\nStep 4: Determine the distances between the centers and the points of tangency\nLet the distance between the center $(x_{1},y_{1})$ and the point $(9,6)$ be $r_{1}$ and the distance between the center $(x_{2},y_{2})$ and the point $(9,6)$ be $r_{2}$. Since the product of the radii is $68$, we have $r_{1}r_{2} = 68$.\n\nStep 5: Use the distance formula to find the distances\nUsing the distance formula, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(9-x_{1})^{2} + (6-y_{1})^{2}} &= r_{1}\\\\\n\\sqrt{(9-x_{2})^{2} + (6-y_{2})^{2}} &= r_{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nStep 6: Use the equations of the tangent lines to find the centers of the circles\nSince the line $y = mx$ intersects the circles, we can substitute it into the equations of the circles to find the centers. However, this is a bit complicated, so let's use a different approach.\n\nStep 7: Find the angle between the center of $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and the point $(9,6)$\nLet the angle between the center of $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and the point $(9,6)$ be $\\theta$. Then we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cos\\theta &= \\frac{9-x_{1}}{r_{1}}\\\\\n\\sin\\theta &= \\frac{6-y_{1}}{r_{1}}\n\\end{align*}\n\nStep 8: Find the angle between the center of $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ and the point $(9,6)$\nSimilarly, let the angle between the center of $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ and the point $(9,6)$ be $\\phi$. Then we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cos\\phi &= \\frac{9-x_{2}}{r_{2}}\\\\\n\\sin\\phi &= \\frac{6-y_{2}}{r_{2}}\n\\end{align*}\n\nStep 9: Use the law of cosines to find the relation between the radii\nUsing the law of cosines, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\nr_{1}^{2} + r_{2}^{2} - 2r_{1}r_{2}\\cos(\\theta-\\phi) &= (9-x_{1})^{2} + (9-x_{2})^{2} + (6-y_{1})^{2} + (6-y_{2})^{2} - 2(9-x_{1})(9-x_{2}) - 2(6-y_{1})(6-y_{2})\\\\\nr_{1}^{2} + r_{2}^{2} - 2r_{1}r_{2}\\cos(\\theta-\\phi) &= 81 + 81 + 36 + 36 - 2(9-x_{1})(9-x_{2}) - 2(6-y_{1})(6-y_{2})\\\\\nr_{1}^{2} + r_{2}^{2} - 2r_{1}r_{2}\\cos(\\theta-\\phi) &= 234 - 2(9-x_{1})(9-x_{2}) - 2(6-y_{1})(6-y_{2})\n\\end{align*}\n\nHowever, we can simplify this expression by noticing that the line $y = mx$ is tangent to both circles. This means that the line connecting the center of $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ to the point of tangency with the line $y = mx$ is perpendicular to the line $y = mx$. Therefore, we have\n\n$$\\tan\\theta = \\frac{1}{m}$$\n\nSimilarly, we have\n\n$$\\tan\\phi = m$$\n\nStep 10: Use the relation between the radii to find the value of $m$\nSince we have $r_{1}r_{2} = 68$, we can substitute this into the equation from Step 9 and use the relations between $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ to find the value of $m$.\n\nHowever, we can simplify this process by noticing that the point $(9,6)$ is on the line $y = mx$. Therefore, we have\n\n$$6 = 9m$$\n\nSolving for $m$, we get\n\n$$m = \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}$$\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $a + b + c = 2 + 3 + 3 = \\boxed{8}$."
