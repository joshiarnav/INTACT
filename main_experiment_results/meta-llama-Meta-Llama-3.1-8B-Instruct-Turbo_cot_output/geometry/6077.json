    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with $AC = 7,$ $BC = 24,$ and right angle at $C.$ Point $M$ is the midpoint of $AB,$ and $D$ is on the same side of line $AB$ as $C$ so that $AD = BD = 15.$ Given that the area of triangle $CDM$ may be expressed as $\\frac {m\\sqrt {n}}{p},$ where $m,$ $n,$ and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, find $m + n + p.$\n",
    "solution": "We use the Pythagorean Theorem on $ABC$ to determine that $AB=25.$\nLet $N$ be the orthogonal projection from $C$ to $AB.$ Thus, $[CDM]=\\frac{(DM)(MN)} {2}$, $MN=AM-AN$, and $[ABC]=\\frac{24 \\cdot 7} {2} =\\frac{25 \\cdot (CN)} {2}.$\nFrom the third equation, we get $CN=\\frac{168} {25}.$\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem in $\\Delta ACN,$ we have\n$AN=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{24 \\cdot 25} {25}\\right)^2-\\left(\\frac{24 \\cdot 7} {25}\\right)^2}=\\frac{24} {25}\\sqrt{25^2-7^2}=\\frac{576} {25}.$\nThus, $MN=\\frac{576} {25}-\\frac{25} {2}=\\frac{527} {50}.$\nIn $\\Delta ADM$, we use the Pythagorean Theorem to get $DM=\\sqrt{15^2-\\left(\\frac{25} {2}\\right)^2}=\\frac{5} {2} \\sqrt{11}.$\nThus, $[CDM]=\\frac{527 \\cdot 5\\sqrt{11}} {50 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2}= \\frac{527\\sqrt{11}} {40}.$\nHence, the answer is $527+11+40=\\boxed{578}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of triangle CDM, we need to find the lengths of its sides.\n\nStep 1: Find the length of side AB in triangle ABC.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nAC\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2\n\n7\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 = AB\u00b2\n49 + 576 = AB\u00b2\n625 = AB\u00b2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nAB = \u221a625 = 25\n\nStep 2: Find the length of side CM in triangle CDM.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of side AM in triangle ABC.\n\nSince M is the midpoint of AB, we can divide the length of AB by 2:\n\nAM = AB/2 = 25/2 = 12.5\n\nNow, we can use the similar triangles property to find the length of CM.\n\nTriangle ACD is similar to triangle CDM, and triangle ABC is similar to triangle ACD.\n\nUsing the similarity of triangles ABC and ACD, we can set up the following proportion:\n\nAC/CD = AC/AD\n\n7/CD = 7/15\n\nCD = 15\n\nNow, using the similarity of triangles ABC and CDM, we can set up the following proportion:\n\nAC/CD = AC/CM\n\n7/15 = 7/CM\n\nCM = 15\n\nStep 3: Find the length of side DM in triangle CDM.\n\nWe know that CD = 15 and CM = 15. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of DM:\n\nDM\u00b2 + CM\u00b2 = CD\u00b2\n\nDM\u00b2 + 15\u00b2 = 15\u00b2\n\nDM\u00b2 = 0\n\nDM = \u221a0 = 0\n\nThis is incorrect, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem on the sides of triangle ACD, to find the height of this triangle that is also the altitude of triangle ABC from vertex C, and thus the altitude of CDM and use that to find the area of triangle CDM.\n\nStep 4: Find the height of triangle ACD.\n\nUsing Heron's formula, we can find the area of triangle ABC:\n\nArea = \u221a(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))\n\nwhere s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, and a, b, c are the side lengths.\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2\ns = (7 + 24 + 25)/2\ns = 28\n\nArea = \u221a(28(28-7)(28-24)(28-25))\nArea = \u221a(28(21)(4)(3))\nArea = \u221a(7056)\n\nArea = \u221a(144\u00b2 * 4.875)\n\nArea = 144\u221a4.875\n\nThe area of triangle ABC is 144\u221a4.875.\n\nStep 5: Find the height of triangle ACD.\n\nWe can use the area of triangle ABC to find the height of triangle ACD:\n\nArea = (base * height)/2\n\n144\u221a4.875 = (25 * height)/2\n\nheight = (2 * 144\u221a4.875)/25\n\nheight = 2 * 144 * \u221a4.875 / 25\n\nheight = 288 * \u221a4.875 / 25\n\nNow that we have the height, we can use it to find the area of triangle CDM:\n\nStep 6: Find the area of triangle CDM.\n\nUsing the area formula for a triangle, we can find the area of triangle CDM:\n\nArea = (base * height)/2\n\nUsing the height we found earlier, we can set up the equation:\n\nArea = (15 * height)/2\n\nArea = (15 * 288 * \u221a4.875) / (2 * 25)\n\nArea = (15 * 288 * \u221a(3.90625 * 16)) / 50\n\nArea = (4320 * \u221a(3.90625 * 16)) / 50\n\nArea = (4320 * \u221a(62.5)) / 50\n\nArea = (4320 * \u221a(25 * 2.5)) / 50\n\nArea = (4320 * 5 * \u221a(2.5)) / 50\n\nArea = (21600 * \u221a(2.5)) / 50\n\nArea = (21600 * \u221a(5/2)) / 50\n\nArea = (21600 * \u221a(5) / \u221a(2)) / 50\n\nArea = (21600\u221a5) / (50 * \u221a(2))\n\nArea = (21600\u221a5) / (50\u221a(2))\n\nArea = (21600\u221a5) / (50 * \u221a(2))\n\nArea = (21600\u221a5) / (50 * \u221a(2))\n\nArea = (21600\u221a5) / (50 * \u221a(2))\n\nArea = (21600\u221a10) / 100\n\nArea = (10800\u221a10) / 50\n\nArea = (2160\u221a10) / 10\n\nArea = 216\u221a10\n\nStep 7: Find the final answer.\n\nWe are asked to find the sum of the numerator, denominator, and the number under the square root.\n\nm = numerator = 216\nn = number under the square root = 10\np = denominator = 1\n\nThe final answer is m + n + p = 216 + 10 + 1 = 227."
