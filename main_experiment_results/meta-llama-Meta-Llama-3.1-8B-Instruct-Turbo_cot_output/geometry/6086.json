    "problem": "Square $ABCD$ has sides of length 2. Set $S$ is the set of all line segments that have length 2 and whose endpoints are on adjacent sides of the square. The midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ enclose a region whose area to the nearest hundredth is $k$. Find $100k$.\n",
    "solution": "Without loss of generality, let $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, $(0,2)$, and $(2,2)$ be the vertices of the square. Suppose the endpoints of the segment lie on the two sides of the square determined by the vertex $(0,0)$. Let the two endpoints of the segment have coordinates $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$. Because the segment has length 2, $x^2+y^2=4$. Using the midpoint formula, we find that the midpoint of the segment has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Let $d$ be the distance from $(0,0)$ to $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Using the distance formula we see that $d=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2}= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}\\left(x^2+y^2\\right)}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}(4)}=1$. Thus the midpoints lying on the sides determined by vertex $(0,0)$ form a quarter-circle with radius 1.\n[asy] size(100); pointpen=black;pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); pair A=(0,0),B=(2,0),C=(2,2),D=(0,2); D(A--B--C--D--A);  picture p; draw(p,CR(A,1));draw(p,CR(B,1));draw(p,CR(C,1));draw(p,CR(D,1)); clip(p,A--B--C--D--cycle); add(p); [/asy]\nThe set of all midpoints forms a quarter circle at each corner of the square.

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the area enclosed by the midpoints of the line segments in set $S$. \n\nLet's consider a line segment in set $S$ with endpoints $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$. Since the line segment has a length of 2, we can write:\n\n$x^2 + y^2 = 4$ (Equation 1)\n\nThe midpoint of this line segment is given by:\n\n$(\\frac{x}{2}, \\frac{y}{2})$\n\nWe can consider another line segment with endpoints $(x',0)$ and $(0,y')$. The midpoint of this line segment is given by:\n\n$(\\frac{x'}{2}, \\frac{y'}{2})$\n\nWe can find the distance between the midpoints of the two line segments:\n\n$(\\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{x'}{2})^2 + (\\frac{y}{2} - \\frac{y'}{2})^2 = 2^2$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$(\\frac{x - x'}{2})^2 + (\\frac{y - y'}{2})^2 = 4$\n\nUsing Equation 1, we can rewrite this equation as:\n\n$(\\frac{x - x'}{2})^2 + (\\frac{\\sqrt{4 - x^2}}{2})^2 = 4$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$(x - x')^2 + (2 - x^2) = 8$\n\nExpanding this equation, we get:\n\n$x^2 - 2xx' + x'^2 + 2 - x^2 = 8$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$x^2 - 2xx' + x'^2 = 6$\n\nUsing Equation 1, we can rewrite this equation as:\n\n$(x - x')^2 + (2 - x^2) = 6$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$(x - x')^2 = 4 - x^2$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$x - x' = \\pm \\sqrt{4 - x^2}$\n\nSince $x$ and $x'$ are coordinates of points on the sides of the square, we know that $0 \\leq x \\leq 2$ and $0 \\leq x' \\leq 2$. We can consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: $x \\geq x'$. In this case, we can write:\n\n$x' = x - \\sqrt{4 - x^2}$\n\nCase 2: $x < x'$. In this case, we can write:\n\n$x' = x + \\sqrt{4 - x^2}$\n\nWe can consider a line segment with endpoints $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$. The midpoint of this line segment is given by:\n\n$(\\frac{x}{2}, \\frac{y}{2})$\n\nWe can find the distance between this midpoint and the midpoints of the line segments with endpoints $(x',0)$ and $(0,y')$. We can consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: $x \\geq x'$. In this case, we can write:\n\n$\\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{x' + \\sqrt{4 - x^2}}{2} = \\frac{x - 2}{2} - \\frac{x - \\sqrt{4 - x^2}}{2}$\n\n$\\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{x' - \\sqrt{4 - x^2}}{2} = \\frac{x - 2}{2} - \\frac{x + \\sqrt{4 - x^2}}{2}$\n\nCase 2: $x < x'$.

We can consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: $x \\geq 1$. In this case, the boundary of the enclosed region is the line segment with endpoints $(1,1)$ and $(1,-1)$. The distance between the midpoint of the line segment with endpoints $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$ and the boundary of the enclosed region is:\n\n$\\frac{x}{2} - 1$\n\nCase 2: $x < 1$. In this case, the boundary of the enclosed region is the line segment with endpoints $(1,1)$ and $(1,-1)$. The distance between the midpoint of the line segment with endpoints $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$ and the boundary of the enclosed region is:\n\n$\\frac{x}{2} + 1$\n\nWe can find the area enclosed by the midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ by integrating the distance between the midpoints and the boundary of the enclosed region with respect to $x$.\n\nWe can consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$. In this case, the distance between the midpoint of the line segment with endpoints $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$ and the boundary of the enclosed region is:\n\n$\\frac{x}{2} + 1$\n\nThe area enclosed by the midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ is:\n\n$\\int_{0}^{1} (\\frac{x}{2} + 1) dx = \\frac{x^2}{4} + x \\Big|_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{4} + 1 = \\frac{5}{4}$\n\nCase 2: $1 < x \\leq 2$. In this case, the distance between the midpoint of the line segment with endpoints $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$ and the boundary of the enclosed region is:\n\n$\\frac{x}{2} - 1$\n\nThe area enclosed by the midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ is:\n\n$\\int_{1}^{2} (\\frac{x}{2} - 1) dx = \\frac{x^2}{4} - 2x \\Big|_{1}^{2} = \\frac{4}{4} - 4 - \\frac{1}{4} + 2 = 1 - 2 = -1$\n\nHowever, the area enclosed by the midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ is positive. We can consider the distance between the midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ and the boundary of the enclosed region as:\n\n$\\frac{x}{2} - 1$\n\nHowever, this distance is negative for $x < 1$. We can consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: $1 < x \\leq 2$. In this case, the distance between the midpoint of the line segment with endpoints $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$ and the boundary of the enclosed region is:\n\n$\\frac{x}{2} - 1$\n\nThe area enclosed by the midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ is:\n\n$\\int_{1}^{2} (\\frac{x}{2} - 1) dx = \\frac{x^2}{4} - 2x \\Big|_{1}^{2} = \\frac{4}{4} - 4 - \\frac{1}{4} + 2 = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nCase 2: $0 \\leq x < 1$. In this case, the distance between the midpoint of the line segment with endpoints $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$ and the boundary of the enclosed region is:\n\n$\\frac{x}{2} + 1$\n\nThe area enclosed by the midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ is:\n\n$\\int_{0}^{1} (\\frac{x}{2} + 1) dx = \\frac{x^2}{4} + x \\Big|_{0}^{1} = \\frac{5}{4}$\n\nThe total area enclosed by the midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ is:\n\n$\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{5}{4} = 1$\n\nTherefore, the area enclosed by the midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ to the nearest hundredth is:\n\n$k = 1$\n\nFinally, we can find:\n\n$100k = 100(1) = 100$"
