    "problem": "A right circular cone has base radius $r$ and height $h$. The cone lies on its side on a flat table. As the cone rolls on the surface of the table without slipping, the point where the cone's base meets the table traces a circular arc centered at the point where the vertex touches the table. The cone first returns to its original position on the table after making $17$ complete rotations. The value of $h/r$ can be written in the form $m\\sqrt {n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n$.\n",
    "solution": "The path is a circle with radius equal to the slant height of the cone, which is $\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}}$. Thus, the length of the path is $2\\pi\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}}$.\nAlso, the length of the path is 17 times the circumference of the base, which is $34r\\pi$. Setting these equal gives $\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}} = 17r$, or $h^{2} = 288r^{2}$. Thus, $\\dfrac{h^{2}}{r^{2}} = 288$, and $\\dfrac{h}{r} = 12\\sqrt {2}$, giving an answer of $12 + 2 = \\boxed{14}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's consider the path traced by the point where the cone's base meets the table. This path is a circle with a radius equal to the slant height of the cone, which is given by $\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$.\n\nWhen the cone rolls on the table, the point where the base meets the table traces out this circular path. The cone makes 17 complete rotations, so the distance traveled by this point is equal to the circumference of the circular path. The circumference of the circular path is given by $2\\pi\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$.\n\nThe distance traveled by the point where the base meets the table is also equal to the circumference of the circle traced by the cone's vertex. Let's call the radius of this circle $R$. Then the circumference of this circle is $2\\pi R$.\n\nSince the cone makes 17 complete rotations, the circumference of the circle traced by the cone's vertex is 17 times the circumference of the circular path. This gives us the equation:\n\n$2\\pi R = 17 \\times 2\\pi\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between the radius of the circle traced by the cone's vertex and the radius of the cone's base. The radius of the circle traced by the cone's vertex is equal to the distance from the vertex to the point where the base meets the table. Let's call this distance $l$. Then we have:\n\n$l = \\sqrt{h^2 + r^2}$\n\nSince $R = l$, we have:\n\n$R = \\sqrt{h^2 + r^2}$\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for $R$ into the equation above:\n\n$2\\pi \\sqrt{h^2 + r^2} = 17 \\times 2\\pi\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$\n\nDividing both sides by $2\\pi$, we get:\n\n$\\sqrt{h^2 + r^2} = 17\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n$h^2 + r^2 = 289r^2 + 289h^2$\n\nSubtracting $289r^2$ and $h^2$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$288r^2 = 288h^2$\n\nDividing both sides by 288, we get:\n\n$r^2 = h^2$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$r = h$\n\nNow we can take the ratio of $h$ to $r$, which is given by:\n\n$h/r = h/h = 1$\n\nHowever, the problem states that the value of $h/r$ can be written in the form $m\\sqrt {n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. This means that we need to express $h/r$ in this form.\n\nTo do this, let's go back to the equation:\n\n$\\sqrt{h^2 + r^2} = 17\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n$h^2 + r^2 = 289r^2 + 289h^2$\n\nSubtracting $h^2$ and $r^2$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$0 = 288r^2 + 288h^2$\n\nDividing both sides by 288, we get:\n\n$0 = r^2 + h^2$\n\nSubtracting $h^2$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$-h^2 = r^2$\n\nDividing both sides by $-h^2$, we get:\n\n$-1 = (r/h)^2$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$-1 = r/h$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $-1$, we get:\n\n$1 = h/r$\n\nHowever, we need to express $h/r$ in the form $m\\sqrt {n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.\n\nTo do this, let's go back to the equation:\n\n$\\sqrt{h^2 + r^2} = 17\\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n$h^2 + r^2 = 289r^2 + 289h^2$\n\nSubtracting $h^2$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$r^2 = 288r^2 + 288h^2$\n\nSubtracting $288r^2$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$-287r^2 = 288h^2$\n\nDividing both sides by $-288h^2$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{287}{288} = \\frac{r^2}{h^2}$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{287}}{\\sqrt{288}} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{16} = 4$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{287/16}}{\\sqrt{72}} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{287/16}}{6\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{2}$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{287/32}}{6\\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{287/32}}{6} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\nDividing the numerator and denominator by 6 and multiplying the numerator by 6, we get:\n\n$\\frac{6\\sqrt{287/32}}{36} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{287/32}}{6} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{287}}{6} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{32}}{\\sqrt{32}} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{287 \\times 32}}{6} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{4\\sqrt{287 \\times 4}}{6} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{4\\sqrt{287 \\times 16}}{6} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{4\\sqrt{11584}}{6} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{4\\sqrt{288 \\times 40}}{6} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{4\\sqrt{576 \\times 40/576}}{6} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{4\\sqrt{576} \\times \\sqrt{40/576}}{6} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{4 \\times 24 \\times \\sqrt{40/576}}{6} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{96 \\times \\sqrt{40/576}}{6} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{24 \\times \\sqrt{40/576}}{6/4} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{24 \\times \\sqrt{40/576}}{3/2} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{24 \\times \\sqrt{40/576} \\times 2/3} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{16 \\times \\sqrt{40/576} \\times 2/3} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{32 \\times \\sqrt{40/576} \\times 1/3} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{32 \\times \\sqrt{5/144} \\times 1/3} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{32 \\times \\sqrt{5} \\times \\sqrt{1/144} \\times 1/3} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{32 \\times \\sqrt{5} \\times 1/\\sqrt{144} \\times 1/3} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{32 \\times \\sqrt{5} \\times 1/12 \\times 1/3} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{32 \\times \\sqrt{5} \\times 1/36} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{5} \\times 32/36} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{5} \\times 16/18} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{5} \\times 8/9} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{8\\sqrt{5}/9} = \\frac{r}{h}$\n\n$\\frac{8\\sqrt{5}}{9} = \\frac{h}{r}$\n\nSince $\\frac{h}{r} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{5}}{9}$, we have:\n\n$m = 8$\n\n$n = 5$\n\nTherefore, the value of $m + n$ is:\n\n$m + n = 8 + 5 = 13$"
