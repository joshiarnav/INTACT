    "problem": "A triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units. The length of the third side is $x$ units, where $x$ is an integer. What is the largest possible perimeter of the triangle?",
    "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest possible perimeter of the triangle, we need to determine the largest possible value of the third side, x.\n\nStep 1: According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nStep 2: Given sides of lengths 5 and 6, we can set up the following inequalities for the third side, x:\n   - x + 5 > 6\n   - x + 6 > 5\n   - 5 + 6 > x\n\nStep 3: Simplifying these inequalities, we get:\n   - x > 1\n   - x > -1\n   - 11 > x\n\nStep 4: The first and third inequalities restrict x to be less than 11, but greater than 1. Since x must be an integer, the possible values of x are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\n\nStep 5: To find the largest possible perimeter, we need to find the largest possible value of x that satisfies the inequalities. The largest value of x is 10, so the largest possible perimeter will be the sum of the lengths of the three sides, which is 5 + 6 + 10 = 21 units.\n\nThe final answer is 21."
