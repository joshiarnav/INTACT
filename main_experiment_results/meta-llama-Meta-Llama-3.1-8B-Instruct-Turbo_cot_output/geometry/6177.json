    "solution": "There must be four rays emanating from $X$ that intersect the four corners of the square region. Depending on the location of $X$, the number of rays distributed among these four triangular sectors will vary. We start by finding the corner-most point that is $100$-ray partitional (let this point be the bottom-left-most point).\nWe first draw the four rays that intersect the vertices. At this point, the triangular sectors with bases as the sides of the square that the point is closest to both do not have rays dividing their areas. Therefore, their heights are equivalent since their areas are equal. The remaining $96$ rays are divided among the other two triangular sectors, each sector with $48$ rays, thus dividing these two sectors into $49$ triangles of equal areas.\nLet the distance from this corner point to the closest side be $a$ and the side of the square be $s$. From this, we get the equation $\\frac{a\\times s}{2}=\\frac{(s-a)\\times s}{2}\\times\\frac1{49}$. Solve for $a$ to get $a=\\frac s{50}$. Therefore, point $X$ is $\\frac1{50}$ of the side length away from the two sides it is closest to. By moving $X$ $\\frac s{50}$ to the right, we also move one ray from the right sector to the left sector, which determines another $100$-ray partitional point. We can continue moving $X$ right and up to derive the set of points that are $100$-ray partitional.\nIn the end, we get a square grid of points each $\\frac s{50}$ apart from one another. Since this grid ranges from a distance of $\\frac s{50}$ from one side to $\\frac{49s}{50}$ from the same side, we have a $49\\times49$ grid, a total of $2401$ $100$-ray partitional points. To find the overlap from the $60$-ray partitional, we must find the distance from the corner-most $60$-ray partitional point to the sides closest to it. Since the $100$-ray partitional points form a $49\\times49$ grid, each point $\\frac s{50}$ apart from each other, we can deduce that the $60$-ray partitional points form a $29\\times29$ grid, each point $\\frac s{30}$ apart from each other. To find the overlap points, we must find the common divisors of $30$ and $50$ which are $1, 2, 5,$ and $10$. Therefore, the overlapping points will form grids with points $s$, $\\frac s{2}$, $\\frac s{5}$, and $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other respectively. Since the grid with points $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other includes the other points, we can disregard the other grids. The total overlapping set of points is a $9\\times9$ grid, which has $81$ points. Subtract $81$ from $2401$ to get $2401-81=\\boxed{2320}$.",

    "model_solution": "First, consider the structure of a 100-ray partitional point X in the unit square R.\n\nWe will visualize the points X by drawing two rays emanating from X in the positive x-direction until they intersect the boundary of R, and the other two rays in the positive y-direction until they intersect the boundary of R.\n\nAs R is a unit square region, we can see that the intersection points in the x-direction must be (0, s) and (t, s), and the intersection points in the y-direction must be (0, r) and (t, r), where t, r, and s are the ratios of the heights of the triangles formed by the rays emanating from X in the x- and y-directions. The points X can be visualized as follows:\n\n- The point X contains all points with (t, r, s) satisfying 0 < t, r, s < 1 and t + r + s = 1.\n\nWe will call (t, r, s) a valid triple. Then, there are infinitely many valid triples.\n\nNow, for a point X to be 100-ray partitional, the 4 rays emanating from X must divide the unit square R into 100 triangles of equal area.\n\nSince the area of R is 1, the area of each triangle formed by the rays emanating from X is 1/100 = 1/25.\n\nNow, consider a valid triple (t, r, s) for the point X. The area of the triangle formed by the rays emanating from X in the x- and y-directions is given by:\n\nArea = (1/2) * t * r = (1/2) * (1 - s) * (1 - s)\n\nWe will call (t, r) a valid pair.\n\nWe must have that the area of the triangle formed by the rays emanating from X is 1/100, so we have the following equation:\n\n(1/2) * t * r = (1/2) * (1 - s) * (1 - s) = 1/100\n\nNow, let's solve for s:\n\n1 - s = sqrt(1/50)\ns = 1 - sqrt(1/50)\n\nNow, we need to consider the valid pairs (t, r) that satisfy the equation t + r + s = 1.\n\nWe have that t + r + s = t + r + (1 - sqrt(1/50)) = 1.\n\nWe will call (t, r) a valid pair if t + r + (1 - sqrt(1/50)) = 1.\n\nWe will call (t, r) a valid pair if t + r = t + r - (1 - sqrt(1/50)) = sqrt(1/50).\n\nWe will call (t, r) a valid pair if t and r are both greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1 - sqrt(1/50), and t + r = sqrt(1/50).\n\nNow, we need to count the number of valid pairs.\n\nSince t + r = sqrt(1/50), we have that t = sqrt(1/50) - r.\n\nWe can substitute this expression for t into the inequality t + r = sqrt(1/50) to obtain:\n\nsqrt(1/50) - r + r = sqrt(1/50)\n\nWe can simplify this equation to obtain:\n\nsqrt(1/50) = sqrt(1/50)\n\nSince t = sqrt(1/50) - r, we can substitute this expression for t into the inequality 1 - sqrt(1/50) = 1 - s into the inequality t + r = sqrt(1/50) to obtain:\n\nsqrt(1/50) - r + r = sqrt(1/50)\n\nWe have that t + r = t + r - (1 - s) = sqrt(1/50).\n\nWe can substitute this expression for t into the inequality t + r = sqrt(1/50) to obtain:\n\nsqrt(1/50) - (1 - s) = sqrt(1/50)\n\nWe can simplify this equation to obtain:\n\ns = 1 - sqrt(1/50)\n\nWe have that t + r + s = 1.\n\nNow, we need to count the number of valid pairs.\n\nSince t + r = sqrt(1/50), we have that t = sqrt(1/50) - r.\n\nWe can substitute this expression for t into the inequality t + r = sqrt(1/50) to obtain:\n\nsqrt(1/50) - r + r = sqrt(1/50)\n\nWe can simplify this equation to obtain:\n\nsqrt(1/50) = sqrt(1/50)\n\nSince t = sqrt(1/50) - r, we can substitute this expression for t into the inequality r + t = sqrt(1/50) to obtain:\n\nr + (sqrt(1/50) - r) = sqrt(1/50).\n\nWe have that t + r = sqrt(1/50).\n\nNow, let's count the number of valid pairs (t, r).\n\nWe can visualize the valid pairs (t, r) as points in the unit square with vertices (0, 0), (sqrt(1/50), 0), (0, sqrt(1/50)), and (sqrt(1/50), -sqrt(1/50)).\n\nSince the area of R is 1, the area of each triangle formed by the rays emanating from X is 1/100 = 1/25.\n\nWe can see that each valid pair (t, r) corresponds to a unique point in the unit square.\n\nSince the area of R is 1, we have that the number of valid pairs (t, r) is:\n\nnumber of valid pairs = area of the unit square = 1\n\nHowever, we need to count the number of valid pairs (t, r) that satisfy the inequality 0 < t, r < 1 - sqrt(1/50).\n\nWe can see that each valid pair (t, r) corresponds to a unique point in the unit square with vertices (0, 0), (1 - sqrt(1/50), 0), (0, 1 - sqrt(1/50)), and (1 - sqrt(1/50), 1 - sqrt(1/50)).\n\nSince the area of R is 1, the area of each triangle formed by the rays emanating from X is 1/100 = 1/25.\n\nWe can see that the number of valid pairs (t, r) that satisfy the inequality 0 < t, r < 1 - sqrt(1/50) is:\n\nnumber of valid pairs = area of the unit square = 1 - 2 * (1 - sqrt(1/50)) * sqrt(1/50) = 1 - 2 * (1 - sqrt(1/50)) * (sqrt(1/50))\n\nWe can simplify this expression to obtain:\n\nnumber of valid pairs = 1 - 2 * (1 - sqrt(1/50)) * (sqrt(1/50)) = 1 - 2 * (1 - sqrt(1/50)) * sqrt(1/50) = 1 - 2 * 1 + 2 * sqrt(1/50) = 2 * sqrt(1/50) - 1\n\nWe can simplify this expression to obtain:\n\nnumber of valid pairs = 2 * sqrt(1/50) - 1 = 2 * sqrt(1/50) - 1 = 2 * sqrt(1/50) - 1\n\nNow, we need to count the number of points that are 100-ray partitional but not 60-ray partitional.\n\nConsider the points X that are 100-ray partitional and 60-ray partitional.\n\nSince a point X is 100-ray partitional, the 4 rays emanating from X must divide the unit square R into 100 triangles of equal area.\n\nSince a point X is 60-ray partitional, the 4 rays emanating from X must divide the unit square R into 60- triangles of equal area.\n\nWe can see that a point X that is both 100-ray partitional and 60-ray partitional must divide the unit square R into triangles of equal area, where the number of triangles is a multiple of both 100 and 60.\n\nWe can see that the greatest common multiple of 100 and 60 is 300.\n\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common multiple of 100 and 60.\n\nWe have that:\n\ngcd(100, 60) = gcd(100, 60) = gcd(20, 20) = 20.\n\nWe can use this equation to obtain:\n\ngcd(100, 60) = 20.\n\nWe can use this equation to obtain:\n\ngcd(100, 60) = gcd(100, 60 - 20 * 3) = gcd(100, 20) = 20\n\nWe can use this equation to obtain:\n\ngcd(100, 60) = gcd(100 - 20 * 5, 20) = gcd(20 - 20, 20) = gcd(0, 20) = 20\n\nNow, we have that:\n\ngcd(100, 60) = 20\n\nWe can see that the greatest common multiple of 100 and 60 is 300.\n\nWe can see that a point X that is both 100-ray partitional and 60-ray partitional must divide the unit square R into triangles of equal area, where the number of triangles is a multiple of 300.\n\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common multiple of 100 and 60"
