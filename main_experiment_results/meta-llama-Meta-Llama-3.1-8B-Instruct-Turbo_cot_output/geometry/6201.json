    "solution": "The three arcs make up the entire circle, so the circumference of the circle is $3+4+5=12$ and the radius is $\\frac{12}{2\\pi}=\\frac{6}{\\pi}$. Also, the lengths of the arcs are proportional to their corresponding central angles. Thus, we can write the values of the arcs as $3\\theta$, $4\\theta$, and $5\\theta$ for some $\\theta$. By Circle Angle Sum, we obtain $3\\theta+4\\theta+5\\theta=360$. Solving yields $\\theta=30$. Thus, the angles of the triangle are $90$, $120$, and $150$. Using $[ABC]=\\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin{C}$, we obtain $\\frac{r^2}{2}(\\sin{90}+\\sin{120}+\\sin{150})$. Substituting $\\frac{6}{\\pi}$ for $r$ and evaluating yields $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{\\pi^2}(\\sqrt{3}+3)}$.",
