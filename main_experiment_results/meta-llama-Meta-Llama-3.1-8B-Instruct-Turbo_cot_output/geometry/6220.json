    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. To simplify the problem, let's assume that the radius of the large semi-circle is $2$. Then, the diameter $\\overline{AB}$ has a length of $4$, and the radius of the small semi-circle on the right has a length of $1$. \n\n2. We can find the radius of the small semi-circle on the left by considering the Pythagorean theorem. Since the diameter of the semi-circle on the left is $4$ and the diameter of the small semi-circle on the right is $2$, the radius of the semi-circle on the left must be $3$.\n\n3. We can find the area of the shaded region by subtracting the areas of the two small semi-circles from the area of the large semi-circle. The area of the large semi-circle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\pi (2)^2 = 2 \\pi$. The area of the small semi-circle on the left is $\\frac{1}{2} \\pi (3)^2 = \\frac{9}{2} \\pi$, and the area of the small semi-circle on the right is $\\frac{1}{2} \\pi (1)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi$.\n\n4. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is $2 \\pi - \\frac{9}{2} \\pi - \\frac{1}{2} \\pi = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi$.\n\n5. The area of the circle with $\\overline{CD}$ as radius is $\\pi (3)^2 = 9 \\pi$.\n\n6. Therefore, the ratio of the shaded area to the area of the circle with $\\overline{CD}$ as radius is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\pi}{9 \\pi} = \\frac{1}{18}$.\n\nHowever, the answer choices are in a different format. Let's convert our ratio to the format of the answer choices.\n\n7. To convert the ratio $\\frac{1}{18}$ to the format of the answer choices, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $18$ to get $1:18$.\n\n8. However, this answer choice is not among the answer choices. We can simplify the ratio $1:18$ by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $1$. \n\n9. The simplified ratio is $1:18$.\n\nHowever, this is still not among the answer choices. Let's try to simplify the ratio in a different way. \n\n10. We can rewrite the ratio $\\frac{1}{18}$ as $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9}$.\n\n11. The ratio $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9}$ is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{2}: \\frac{9}{9}$.\n\n12. The ratio $\\frac{1}{2}: \\frac{9}{9}$ is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{2}: 1$.\n\n13. The ratio $\\frac{1}{2}: 1$ is equivalent to $1: 2$.\n\nHowever, the ratio $1:2$ is not correct either. Let's think about the problem again.\n\nThe area of the shaded region is equal to the area of the large semi-Circle minus the areas of the two small semi-circles. The area of the large semi-circle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\pi (4)^2 = 4 \\pi$, the area of the small semi-circle on the right is $\\frac{1}{2} \\pi (1)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi$, and the area of the small semi-circle on the left is $\\frac{1}{2} \\pi (2)^2 = 2 \\pi$. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is $4 \\pi - \\frac{1}{2} \\pi - 2 \\pi = \\frac{3}{2} \\pi$.\n\nThe area of the circle with $\\overline{CD}$ as radius is $\\pi (3)^2 = 9 \\pi$.\n\nThe ratio of the shaded area to the area of the circle with $\\overline{CD}$ as radius is $\\frac{\\frac{3}{2} \\pi}{9 \\pi} = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nHowever, the answer choices are not in the format of a ratio between two numbers. Let's convert our ratio to the format of the answer choices.\n\nThe ratio $\\frac{1}{6}$ is equivalent to $1:6$.\n\nThe final answer is not $1:6$."
