    "solution": "Let the coordinates of $A$ be $(a_1,a_2)$. Then since $A$ is on the graph of $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, we know that $a_2 = -\\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$. We can also use our knowledge of special right triangles to write $a_2$ in terms of $a_1$. Let $C$ be the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ and let $O$ be the origin. Then $OCA$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, so the ratio of the length of $OC$ to the length of $CA$ is $\\sqrt{3}:1$. Now the coordinates of C are $(0, a_2)$, so the length of $OC$ is just $-a_2$ (since $a_2$ is negative) and the length of $CA$ is $a_1$. This means $\\dfrac{-a_2}{a_1}=\\sqrt{3} \\Longrightarrow a_2=-\\sqrt{3}a_1$.\n\nWe can now set our two equations for $a_2$ equal to each other and get $-\\sqrt{3}a_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$. Multiplying both sides by $-\\frac{2}{a_1}$ immediately gives $a_1=2\\sqrt{3}$. From here we could solve for $a_2$ using one of our equations and then use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the side length of the equilateral triangle, but there's a better way. We remember that the hypotenuse of our special triangle is twice as long as the shortest side of it, which has length $a_1=2\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore our answer is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the length of one side of triangle $ABO$, let's start by finding the coordinates of $A$ and $B$.\n\nSince triangle $ABO$ is equilateral, and $O$ is the origin, $A$ and $B$ must be reflections of each other across the y-axis. \n\nThe equation of the graph is $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$. We can find the midpoint of $AB$, which is also the center of the parabola. Since the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, its vertex will also be on the y-axis. \n\nTherefore, the x-coordinate of the midpoint of $AB$ is 0, and the y-coordinate is $-\\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 = 0$. The midpoint of $AB$ is (0, 0).\n\nNow, let $A$ be at the point $(a, b)$. Since $A$ and $B$ are reflections of each other across the y-axis, point $B$ will be at $(-a, b)$.\n\nThe distance between $A$ and $O$ is equal to the distance between $B$ and $O$, which is equal to the distance between $A$ and $B$ because triangle $ABO$ is equilateral. Therefore, we can use the distance formula to set up an equation.\n\nThe distance between $A$ and $O$ is $\\sqrt{(a - 0)^2 + (b - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.\n\nThe distance between $B$ and $O$ is $\\sqrt{(-a - 0)^2 + (b - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.\n\nThe distance between $A$ and $B$ is $\\sqrt{(a - (-a))^2 + (b - b)^2} = \\sqrt{4a^2}$.\n\nSetting these distances equal to each other, we get $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{4a^2}$.\n\nSquaring both sides, we get $a^2 + b^2 = 4a^2$.\n\nNow, we also know that the point $A$ lies on the graph of $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$. Therefore, we can substitute $b$ with $-\\frac{1}{2}a^2$.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation $a^2 + b^2 = 4a^2$, we get $a^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}a^2\\right)^2 = 4a^2$.\n\nExpanding the left side, we get $a^2 + \\frac{1}{4}a^4 = 4a^2$.\n\nSubtracting $4a^2$ from both sides, we get $\\frac{1}{4}a^4 - 3a^2 = 0$.\n\nFactoring out an $a^2$, we get $a^2(\\frac{1}{4}a^2 - 3) = 0$.\n\nSetting each factor equal to 0, we get $a^2 = 0$ or $\\frac{1}{4}a^2 - 3 = 0$.\n\nSolving for the first equation, we get $a = 0$.\n\nSince we're looking for the x-coordinate of point $A$, we can ignore this solution.\n\nSolving for the second equation, we get $a^2 = 12$.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $a = \\pm\\sqrt{12} = \\pm2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nSince the x-coordinate of point $A$ must be positive, we choose $a = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of point $A$, we can find its y-coordinate using the equation of the parabola.\n\nThe y-coordinate of point $A$ is $b = -\\frac{1}{2}(2\\sqrt{3})^2 = -\\frac{1}{2}(12) = -6$.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of point $A$ are $(2\\sqrt{3}, -6)$.\n\nSince the coordinates of point $B$ are $(-2\\sqrt{3}, -6)$, we can find the length of one side of triangle $ABO$.\n\nThe length of one side is the distance between $A$ and $B$, which is $\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{3} - (-2\\sqrt{3}))^2 + (-6 - (-6))^2}$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $\\sqrt{4(3) + 0} = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the length of one side of triangle $ABO$ is $2\\sqrt{3}$."
