    "problem": "How many different triangles can be formed having a perimeter of 7 units if each side must have integral length?",
    "solution": "Let $a,b,$ and $c$ represent the three side lengths of the triangle. The perimeter is $a+b+c=7,$ so $b+c=7-a$. We know by the Triangle Inequality that the sum of two side lengths of a triangle must be greater than the third side length. If we focus on the variable $a$, we have\n\\[b+c>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 7-a>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 3.5>a.\\]We could easily replace $a$ with $b$ or $c$, so the maximum length of any of the three sides is $3$. If $a=3$, then $b+c=4$ and $b$ and $c$ could be $1$ and $3$ in some order or $2$ and $2$ in some order. If we let $a=2$ or $a=1$ and the maximum side length is $3$, we'll still end up with triangles of side lengths $(1,3,3)$ or $(2,2,3)$. There are $\\boxed{2}$ different triangles.",

    "model_solution": "To form a triangle with a perimeter of 7 units, we need to consider all the possible combinations of side lengths that add up to 7. Since each side must have integral length, we can start by listing all possible combinations.\n\n1. (1, 1, 5): This is not a valid combination because an angle less than 60 degrees would cause the sum of the two smaller sides to be greater than the largest side. Thus a triangle with angles like this would not be a triangle. \n\n2. (1, 2, 4): This is not a valid combination due to the same reasoning above. \n\n3. (1, 3, 3): This is a valid combination. \n\n4. (2, 2, 3): This is also a valid combination."
