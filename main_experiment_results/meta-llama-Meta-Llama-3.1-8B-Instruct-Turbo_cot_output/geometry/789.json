    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the figure step by step.\n\n1. First, let's consider the properties of an equilateral triangle. All three sides of an equilateral triangle are equal in length.\n\n2. Let's denote the length of each side of triangles $ABC$ and $BCD$ as $s$. \n\n3. In triangle $ABC$, we can see that $AB = s$, $BC = s$, and $AC = s$. \n\n4. Since triangle $ABC$ is equilateral, each angle measures $60^\\circ$. So, we can draw an altitude from point $C$ to side $AB$, which will bisect angle $C$ and create two $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangles.\n\n5. In a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ right triangle, the ratio of the length of the shorter leg to the length of the hypotenuse is $1:2$ and the ratio of the length of the longer leg to the length of the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{3}:2$.\n\n6. The altitude from point $C$ to side $AB$ creates a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ right triangle with $BC$ as the longer leg and $AC$ as the hypotenuse. Therefore, the length of the shorter leg is $\\frac{s}{2}$ and the length of the longer leg is $\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n7. Since the length of the longer leg is the altitude from point $C$ to side $AB$, let's denote the length of the altitude as $h = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n8. Now, let's focus on triangle $BCD$. Since $BC = s$ and $BD = s$, we can draw an altitude from point $D$ to side $BC$.\n\n9. The altitude from point $D$ to side $BC$ creates a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ right triangle with $BC$ as the longer leg and $BD$ as the hypotenuse. Therefore, the length of the shorter leg is $\\frac{s}{2}$ and the length of the longer leg is $\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n10. Since the length of the longer leg is the altitude from point $D$ to side $BC$, let's denote the length of the altitude as $h' = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\n11. Now, let's consider the length of $AD$. Since $AD$ is the sum of the altitudes from point $D$ to side $BC$ and from point $C$ to side $AB$, we can calculate the length of $AD$ as follows:\n\n$AD = h + h' = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} = s\\sqrt{3}$\n\n12. Finally, we can calculate the value of $AD \\div BC$ as follows:\n\n$AD \\div BC = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{s} = \\sqrt{3}$"
