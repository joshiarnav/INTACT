    "solution": "To make the $8$ triangles have the same area, the base must be divided into $8$ segments of length $1$ inch each.  Define points $A$, $B_0$, $B_1$, $B_2$, $B_3$, and $B_4$ as in the figure.  For $0\\leq k\\leq 3$, the perimeter $P(k)$ of triangle $A B_k B_{k+1}$ in inches is \\[\nP(k)=1+\\sqrt{10^2+k^2}+\\sqrt{10^2+(k+1)^2},\n\\]where each distance $A B_k$ is calculated by applying the Pythagorean theorem to right triangle $A B_0 B_k$.  Since $P(k)$ increases as $k$ increases, its largest value is $P(3)=1+\\sqrt{100+3^2}+\\sqrt{100+4^2}$, which to the nearest hundredth is $\\boxed{22.21}$ inches.

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  Find the area of the isosceles triangle and then divide it into eight pieces of equal area.\n2.  Identify the shapes of these eight pieces.\n3.  Compute the perimeters of all eight pieces.\n4.  Determine the piece with the greatest perimeter.\n\nStep 1: The area of an isosceles triangle can be found by the formula $\\frac{1}{2}bh$. Here, $b = 8$ inches and $h = 10$ inches.\n\nArea = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times 10$ = 40 square inches\n\nTo divide the area into 8 equal pieces, each piece would have an area of $\\frac{40}{8} = 5$ square inches.\n\nStep 2: Since we have an isosceles triangle with a base of 8 inches, cutting it into 8 equal pieces would result in 7 pieces having a base of 1 inch and a height of 10 inches, and the 8th piece would be a trapezoid with bases of 1 inch and 7 inches, and a height of 10 inches.\n\nStep 3: We can find the perimeter of each piece. For the 7 small triangles, it is just 10 + 1 + 10 = 21 inches. For the 8th piece, the perimeter would be 1 + 7 + 10 + 10 = 28 inches.\n\nStep 4: The greatest perimeter among the eight pieces is 28 inches.\n\nSo, to the nearest hundredth of an inch, the number of inches in the greatest perimeter among the eight pieces is 28."
