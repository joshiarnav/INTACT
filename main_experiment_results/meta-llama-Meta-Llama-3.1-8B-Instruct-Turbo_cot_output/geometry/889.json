    "model_solution": "To find the area of triangle $BQW$, we will first find the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ using the given information and then use it to find the area of triangle $WSQ$ and the area of triangle $BQW$.\n\nStep 1: \nSince the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is 120 square units, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid:\n\nArea of trapezoid $= \\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$\n\nwhere $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the parallel sides and $h$ is the height of the trapezoid.\n\nStep 2: \nIn this case, the parallel sides are $ZW$ and $CD$ and the height of the trapezoid is $AB$. However, we are not given the lengths of $ZW$ and $CD$ directly, but we know that $AZ=WC=6$ units and $AB=12$ units. We can use this information to find the lengths of $ZW$ and $CD$.\n\nStep 3: \nSince $ABCD$ is a rectangle, the length of $AD$ is equal to the length of $AB$, which is $12$ units. Therefore, the length of $CD$ is $12 - 6 = 6$ units. \n\nStep 4: \nSince $AZ$ is equal to $6$ units and $AB$ is equal to $12$ units, we can find the length of $ZW$ by adding the length of $AZ$ to the length of $CD$. However, as $AZ + DW = ZW$ and $DW + DC = CD$, it follows that in a rectangle with parallel sides $AB$ and $DC$, $AZ = WC$, $DW = WC$, and $ZW = AZ + DW$. Therefore, $ZW$ equals $12$ units.\n\nStep 5: \nNow we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid to find the area of trape\u0437oid $ZWCD$.\n\nArea of trapezoid $ZWCD = \\frac{1}{2}(ZW + CD) \\times AD$\nArea of trapezoid $ZWCD = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (12 + 6) \\times 12$\nArea of trapezoid $ZWCD = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 18 \\times 12$\nArea of trapezoid $ZWCD = 9 \\times 12 \\times 2$\nArea of trapezoid $ZWCD = 216$\n\nStep 6: \nHowever, this is not the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$, but the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ can be written as the area of triangle $ABZ$ plus the area of triangle $DWC$ plus the area of triangle $WSQ$ plus the area of triangle $BQZ$, which equal the sum of the area of triangle $DWS$ and the area of triangle $QSZ$. As the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is 120 square units, the area of triangle $DWS$ and the area of triangle $QSZ$ should be equal to the difference between the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ and the area of triangle $ABZ$ and the area of triangle $DWC$, which is 216 - 36 - 36 = 144 square units.\n\nStep 7: \nNow we can find the area of triangle $WSQ$ and the area of triangle $DWS$ by using the formula for the area of a triangle:\n\nArea of triangle $= \\frac{1}{2}bh$\n\nwhere $b$ is the length of the base and $h$ is the height of the triangle.\n\nStep 8: \nSince $ABCD$ is a rectangle, the area of triangle $ABZ$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{2} \\times AB \\times AZ = 36$ square units.\n\nStep 9: \nSince $ABCD$ is a rectangle, the area of triangle $DWC$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{2} \\times DC \\times WC = 36$ square units.\n\nStep 10: \nNow we can find the area of triangle $WSQ$ by subtracting the area of triangle $DWS$ from the area of triangle $QSZ$ and then subtract the result from the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$:\n\nArea of trapezoid $ZWCD = 120$ square units\nArea of triangle $ABZ = 36$ square units\nArea of triangle $DWC = 36$ square units\nArea of triangle $DWS$ and the area of triangle $QSZ$ = 144 square units\n\nArea of triangle $WSQ$ = Area of triangle $QSZ$ - Area of triangle $DWS$ = 144 square units - 144 square units / 2 = 144 square units / 2 = 72 square units\n\nStep 11: \nSince we know that the area of triangle $WSQ$ is 72 square units and the area of triangle $DWS$ is 72 square units, we can find the area of triangle $BQW$ by adding the area of triangle $WSQ$ to the area of triangle $DWS$:\n\nArea of triangle $BQW$ = Area of triangle $WSQ$ + Area of triangle $DWS$ = 72 square units + 72 square units = 144 square units."
