    "problem": "A round pizza is $\\frac13$ of an inch thick and has a diameter of 12 inches. It is cut into 12 congruent pieces. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one piece? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "The entire pizza has radius 6 inches and volume $\\pi (6^2)(1/3) = 12\\pi$ cubic inches.  One slice has 1/12th this volume, or $\\boxed{\\pi}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of one piece of the pizza, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the radius of the pizza**: The diameter of the pizza is given as 12 inches. The radius is half of the diameter, so the radius $r$ is $\\frac{12}{2} = 6$ inches.\n\n2. **Find the volume of the entire pizza**: The formula for the volume of a cylinder is $V = \\pi r^2h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height (or thickness in this case). Given that the thickness of the pizza is $\\frac13$ of an inch, we can plug in the values to get:\n\\[V = \\pi (6)^2 \\left(\\frac13\\right) = \\pi (36) \\left(\\frac13\\right) = 12 \\pi \\text{ cubic inches.}\\]\n\n3. **Find the volume of one piece of the pizza**: The pizza is cut into 12 congruent pieces, so to find the volume of one piece, we need to divide the total volume of the pizza by 12:\n\\[V_{\\text{one piece}} = \\frac{12 \\pi}{12} = \\pi \\text{ cubic inches.}\\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of one piece of the pizza is $\\pi$ cubic inches."
