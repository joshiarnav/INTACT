    "problem": "In trapezoid $ABCD$, the parallel sides $AB$ and $CD$ have lengths of 8 and 20 units, respectively, and the altitude is 12 units. Points $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of sides $AD$ and $BC$, respectively. What is the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ in square units?",
    "solution": "Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, quadrilateral $EFCD$ is a trapezoid with half the altitude of the original trapezoid (the altitude of trapezoid $EFCD$ is $12/2 = 6$). The length of base $CD$ is still $20$, but now we have to find the length of base $EF$. Since $EF$ connects the midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, its length is also the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$. Thus, $EF$ has length $\\frac{8+20}{2} = 14$. Finally, we can find the area of the trapezoid with the formula $\\text{Area} = a \\left(\\frac{b_1+b_2}{2}\\right)$ where $a$ is the altitude and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases. The area of trapezoid $EFCD $ is $6 \\left(\\frac{14+20}{2}\\right)=6 \\cdot 17 = \\boxed{102}$ square units.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$, we first need to understand the properties of midpoints in a trapezoid and how they divide the trapezoid into smaller shapes.\n\nSince $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of sides $AD$ and $BC$ respectively, we can infer that quadrilateral $EFCD$ is a trapezoid. Moreover, we know that $EF$ is parallel to both $AB$ and $CD$ because it connects the midpoints of the parallel sides of the trapezoid.\n\nNow, let's consider the altitude of quadrilateral $EFCD$, which is also 12 units since $EF$ is parallel to $AB$ and $CD$. The altitude is the height of the trapezoid. Also, the midsegment of a trapezoid is equal in length to the average of the lengths of the bases. Therefore, the length of $EF$ will be the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$.\n\nWe have that the length of $AB$ is 8 units and the length of $CD$ is 20 units. The average of the lengths of the bases is $\\frac{AB + CD}{2} = \\frac{8 + 20}{2} = 14$. Therefore, $EF$ has a length of 14 units.\n\nWe can now calculate the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$, which is a trapezoid with parallel sides $EF$ and $CD$. We have that the area of a trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}h(b_1 + b_2)$, where $h$ is the height, and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases.\n\nThe area of trapezoid $EFCD$ is:\n$\\frac{1}{2}h(b_1 + b_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(12)(14 + 20) = \\frac{1}{2}(12)(34) = 204$ square units.\n\nTherefore, the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ is 204 square units."
