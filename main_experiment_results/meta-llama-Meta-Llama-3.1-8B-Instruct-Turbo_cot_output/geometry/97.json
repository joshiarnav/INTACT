    "solution": "Label points $A$, $B$, $C$ as shown below, and let $H$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$. [asy]\n\nsize(120);\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA = dir(0); B = dir(60); C = dir(120); D = dir(180); E = dir(240); F = dir(300);\n\nfill(B--C--E--F--cycle,heavycyan); pair H=(E+C)/2; draw(D--H); draw(E--C); label(\"$A$\",C,NW);label(\"$B$\",D,W);label(\"$C$\",E,SW);label(\"$H$\",H,ESE);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\n[/asy] Since the hexagon is regular, $\\angle ABC = 120^\\circ$ and $\\angle ABH = \\angle CBH = 120^\\circ / 2 = 60^\\circ$.  Thus, $\\triangle ABH$ and $\\triangle CBH$ are congruent $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ triangles.  These triangles are each half an equilateral triangle, so their short leg is half as long as their hypotenuse.\n\nSince $AB=BC=10$, we have $BH = AB/2 = 5$ and $AH = CH = \\sqrt{10^2-5^2} = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}$.  (Notice that this value is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of $BH$, the short leg.  In general, the ratio of the sides in a $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, which can be shown by the Pythagorean Theorem.)  Then, $AC = 2\\cdot 5\\sqrt{3} = 10\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe shaded region is a rectangle with base length $10$ and height length $10\\sqrt{3}$; its area is $10\\cdot 10\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{100\\sqrt{3}}$ square cm.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the shaded region, we can start by identifying the shapes that make up the regular hexagon.\n\nThe regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles. Each of these triangles has a side length of 10 cm.\n\nThe shaded region is formed by 4 of these equilateral triangles, so we need to find the area of one of these triangles and multiply it by 4.\n\nThe formula for the area of an equilateral triangle with side length s is:\n\nArea = (s^2 * sqrt(3)) / 4\n\nIn this case, the side length s is 10 cm, so we can plug in the value:\n\nArea = (10^2 * sqrt(3)) / 4\nArea = (100 * sqrt(3)) / 4\nArea = 25 * sqrt(3)\n\nSince the shaded region is made up of 4 of these triangles, we can multiply the area of one triangle by 4:\n\nShaded Area = 4 * (25 * sqrt(3))\nShaded Area = 100 * sqrt(3)\n\nSo, the area of the shaded region is 100 * sqrt(3) square centimeters."
