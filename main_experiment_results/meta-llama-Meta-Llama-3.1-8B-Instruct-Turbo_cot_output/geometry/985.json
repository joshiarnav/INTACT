    "solution": "At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{2}{3}(360^\\circ)=240$ degrees.  Every minute, the minute hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}(360^\\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12} (360^\\circ)=0.5$ degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.  After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\\circ-5.5^\\circ\\cdot 15=\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock, we need to find the position of the hour and minute hands at 8:15.\n\n1. The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which means it moves 30 degrees per hour (360/12 = 30). Since the hour hand moves continuously, we also need to consider the minutes. The hour hand moves 30 degrees per hour, and 0.5 degrees per minute (30/60 = 0.5). At 8:15, the hour hand has moved 8 hours and 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 8 + (15/60) * 30 = 8 + 4.5 = 12.5 * 0.5 = 6.25 degrees.\n\nSo, the hour hand is at 8*30 + 15*0.5 = 247.5 degrees.\n\n2. The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which means it moves 6 degrees per minute. At 8:15, the minute hand has moved 15 * 6 = 90 degrees.\n\nNow, we need to find the smaller angle between the hour hand and the minute hand. To do this, we can find the absolute difference between their positions.\n\nThe absolute difference between the hour hand and the minute hand is |247.5 - 90| = 157.5 degrees.\n\nSo, the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock at 8:15 is approximately 157.5 degrees."
