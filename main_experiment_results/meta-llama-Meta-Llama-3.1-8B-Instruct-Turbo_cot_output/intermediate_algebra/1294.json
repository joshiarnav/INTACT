    "model_solution": "To find the positive value of $t$ that satisfies $ab = t-2i$, we can use the properties of complex numbers. We are given $|a|=2$ and $|b|=\\sqrt{26}$.\n\nFirst, recall that the absolute value of a product of two complex numbers is the product of their absolute values:\n\n$$|ab|=|a||b|.$$\n\nNow, we are given $ab = t-2i$. To find $|ab|$, we need to find the absolute value of $t-2i$. The absolute value of a complex number $z = a+bi$ is given by:\n\n$$|z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.$$\n\nIn this case, we have $a=t$ and $b=-2$. Therefore:\n\n$$|ab|=|t-2i| = \\sqrt{t^2 + (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{t^2 + 4}.$$\n\nNow we can equate the two expressions for $|ab|$:\n\n$$|a||b| = |ab|,$$\n\n$$2\\sqrt{26} = \\sqrt{t^2 + 4}.$$\n\nNow we can square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n$$4\\times 26 = t^2 + 4,$$\n\n$$104 = t^2 + 4,$$\n\n$$t^2 = 100.$$\n\nNow we can take the square root of both sides. We want the positive value of $t$, so we take the positive square root:\n\n$$t = \\sqrt{100} = 10.$$\n\nSo, the positive value of $t$ that satisfies $ab = t-2i$ is $t = 10$."
