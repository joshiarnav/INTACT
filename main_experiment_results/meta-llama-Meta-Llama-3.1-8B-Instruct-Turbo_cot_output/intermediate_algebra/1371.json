    "model_solution": "Given the function $f(x) = ax^6 + bx^4 - cx^2 + 3,$ we are tasked with finding $f(91) + f(-91)$ when $f(91) = 1$.\n\nFirst, let's consider the properties of even and odd functions. \n\nAn even function satisfies $f(x) = f(-x)$ for all $x$ in its domain. \n\nAn odd function satisfies $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.\n\nSince $f(x)$ contains only even powers of $x$, we can conclude that $f(x)$ is an even function.\n\nNow, let's find $f(-x)$ by substituting $-x$ into the original function:\n\n$f(-x) = a(-x)^6 + b(-x)^4 - c(-x)^2 + 3$\n\n$f(-x) = a(x)^6 + b(x)^4 - c(x)^2 + 3$\n\n$f(-x) = f(x)$\n\nThis confirms that $f(x)$ is indeed an even function.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is an even function, we can conclude that $f(-91) = f(91)$.\n\nGiven that $f(91) = 1$, we can write:\n\n$f(-91) = f(91) = 1$\n\nNow, let's find $f(91) + f(-91)$:\n\n$f(91) + f(-91) = 1 + 1 = 2$\n\nTherefore, $f(91) + f(-91) = 2$."
