    "problem": "Let $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c$ for all real numbers $x$, where $c$ is some real number.  For what values of $c$ does $f(f(x))$ have exactly $3$ distinct real roots?",
    "solution": "Suppose the function $f(x) = 0$ has only one distinct root.  If $x_1$ is a root of $f(f(x)) = 0,$ then we must have $f(x_1) = r_1.$  But the equation $f(x) = r_1$ has at most two roots.  Therefore, the equation $f(x) = 0$ must have two distinct roots.  Let them be $r_1$ and $r_2.$\n\nSince $f(f(x)) = 0$ has three distinct roots, one of the equations $f(x) = r_1$ or $f(x) = r_2$ has one distinct root.  Without loss generality, assume that $f(x) = r_1$ has one distinct root.  Then $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c = r_1$ has one root.  This means\n\\[x^2 + 6x + c - r_1\\]must be equal to $(x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9 = 0,$ so $c - r_1 = 9.$  Hence, $r_1 = c - 9.$\n\nSince $r_1$ is a root of $f(x) = 0,$\n\\[(c - 9)^2 + 6(c - 9) + c = 0.\\]Expanding, we get $c^2 - 11c + 27 = 0,$ so\n\\[c = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{2}.\\]If $c = \\frac{11 - \\sqrt{13}}{2},$ then $r_1 = c - 9 = -\\frac{7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}$ and $r_2 = -6 - r_1 = \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{13}}{2},$ so\n\\[f(x) = x^2 + 6x + \\frac{11 - \\sqrt{13}}{2} = \\left( x + \\frac{7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\right) \\left( x + \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\right) = (x + 3)^2 - \\frac{7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}.\\]The equation $f(x) = r_1$ has a double root of $x = -3,$ and the equation $f(x) = r_2$ has two roots, so $f(f(x)) = 0$ has exactly three roots.\n\nIf $c = \\frac{11 + \\sqrt{13}}{2},$ then $r_1 = c - 9 = \\frac{-7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}$ and $r_2 = -6 - r_1 = -\\frac{5 + \\sqrt{13}}{2},$ and\n\\[f(x) = x^2 + 6x + \\frac{11 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} = \\left( x + \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\right) \\left( x + \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\right) = (x + 3)^2 + \\frac{-7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}.\\]The equation $f(x) = r_1$ has a double root of $x = -3,$ but the equation $f(x) = r_2$ has no real roots, so $f(f(x)) = 0$ has exactly one root.\n\nTherefore, $c = \\boxed{\\frac{11 - \\sqrt{13}}{2}}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the values of $c$ for which $f(f(x))$ has exactly $3$ distinct real roots, let's proceed step by step.\n\n1. **First, find $f(f(x))$:**\n\nWe have $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c$. Now, we need to find $f(f(x))$.\n\n$f(f(x)) = f(x^2 + 6x + c)$\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n$f(f(x)) = (x^2 + 6x + c)^2 + 6(x^2 + 6x + c) + c$\n\nExpanding further, we get a very long expression, but we can simplify it by collecting like terms.\n\n$f(f(x)) = x^4 + 12x^3 + (c + 36 + 36)x^2 + (6c + 72 + 6c)x + (c^2 + 6c + c)$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$f(f(x)) = x^4 + 12x^3 + (c + 72)x^2 + (12c + 72)x + (c^2 + 7c)$\n\n2. **To find the roots, set $f(f(x)) = 0$ and solve for $x$:**\n\nThis is a quartic equation in $x$. In general, solving a quartic equation can be difficult, but in this case, we can try to factor it or use other methods to find the roots.\n\nTo find the roots, we need to set $f(f(x)) = 0$ and solve for $x$:\n\n$x^4 + 12x^3 + (c + 72)x^2 + (12c + 72)x + (c^2 + 7c) = 0$\n\n3. **For the quartic equation to have exactly $3$ distinct real roots, one root must be repeated:**\n\nWe know that a quartic equation can have at most $4$ real roots, so to have exactly $3$ distinct real roots, one of them must be repeated.\n\nIn this case, the repeated root corresponds to a double root of the quadratic factor of $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c$. \n\n4. **We can view $f(x)$ as a quadratic equation with a double root:**\n\nSince we're looking for a double root, the quadratic equation $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c$ should have a double root.\n\nA quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ has a double root if its discriminant is zero, i.e., if $b^2 - 4ac = 0$.\n\nFor the quadratic equation $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c$, we have:\n\n$a = 1, b = 6, c = c$\n\nThe discriminant is:\n\n$b^2 - 4ac = 6^2 - 4(1)(c) = 36 - 4c$\n\nFor the quadratic equation to have a double root, we need:\n\n$a^2 - 4ac = 0$\n\nSolving for $c$, we get:\n\n$36 - 4c = 0 \\Rightarrow 36 = 4c \\Rightarrow c = 9$\n\nTherefore, the quadratic equation $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c$ has a double root when $c = 9$.\n\n5. **Now we need to find the values of $c$ for which $f(f(x))$ has exactly $3$ distinct real roots:**\n\nTo do this, we can plug in the values of $c$ we found in the previous step and check if the resulting quartic equation has exactly $3$ distinct real roots.\n\nIf we plug in $c = 9$ into the quartic equation, we get:\n\n$x^4 + 12x^3 + (9 + 72)x^2 + (12(9) + 72)x + ((9)^2 + 7(9)) = 0$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$x^4 + 12x^3 + 81x^2 + 180x + 72 = 0$\n\nFactoring, we get:\n\n$(x + 3)^2 (x^2 + 12x + 24) = 0$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get two distinct real roots: $x = -3$ and $x = -2 \\pm 2 \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the values of $c$ for which $f(f(x))$ has exactly $3$ distinct real roots are $c = 9$.\n\nHowever, since a double root in $f(x)$ would also give an additional distinct real root for $f(f(x))$, we should check for values of $c$ that make $f(x)$ have a double root. These values of $c$ are $c = 9 + 6k$, where $k$ is an integer."
