    "problem": "A sequence $a_1$, $a_2$, $\\ldots$ of non-negative integers is defined by the rule $a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n|$ for $n\\geq1$. If $a_1=999$, $a_2<999$, and $a_{2006}=1$, how many different values of $a_2$ are possible?",
    "solution": "The condition $a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n|$ implies that $a_n$ and $a_{n+3}$ have the same parity for all $n\\geq 1$. Because $a_{2006}$ is odd, $a_2$ is also odd.  Because $a_{2006}=1$ and $a_n$ is a multiple of $\\gcd(a_1,a_2)$ for all $n$, it follows that $1=\\gcd(a_1,a_2)=\\gcd(3^3\\cdot 37,a_2)$. There are 499 odd integers in the interval $[1,998]$, of which 166 are multiples of 3, 13 are multiples of 37, and 4 are multiples of $3\\cdot 37=111$. By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the number of possible values of $a_2$ cannot exceed $499-166-13+4=\\boxed{324}$.\n\nTo see that there are actually 324 possibilities, note that for $n\\geq 3$, $a_n<\\max(a_{n-2},a_{n-1})$ whenever $a_{n-2}$ and $a_{n-1}$ are both positive.  Thus $a_N=0$ for some $N\\leq 1999$. If $\\gcd(a_1,a_2)=1$, then $a_{N-2}=a_{N-1}=1$, and for $n>N$ the sequence cycles through the values 1, 1, 0.  If in addition $a_2$ is odd, then $a_{3k+2}$ is odd for $k\\geq 1$, so $a_{2006}=1$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.\n\n1. **Initial Analysis:**\n\nGiven sequence is defined by the rule $a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n|$ for $n\\geq1$.\n\n- Start with $a_1 = 999$ and $a_2 < 999$.\n\n2. **Behavior of the Sequence:**\n\n- We know that $a_{2006} = 1$. This means that the sequence eventually decreases to 1, and then it starts to alternate between $a_n$ and $|a_n - 1|$.\n\n3. **Key Insight:**\n\n- $a_{2006} = 1$ implies that $a_{2005}$ is equal to either 1 or 0. If $a_{2005} = 0$, then $a_{2006} = |a_{2005} - a_{2004}| = 0 - a_{2004} = -a_{2004}$ which is not possible since it is a non-negative integer, so $a_{2005} = 1$.\n\n4. **Backward Calculation:**\n\n- Since $a_{2005} = 1$, it follows that $a_{2004}$ must equal $a_{2005} - 1 = 0$.\n\n- Continuing this process, we get $a_{2003} = a_{2004} - a_{2003} = -a_{2003}$ which is not possible, so $a_{2003}$ must be equal to 1.\n\n- Generalizing this, $a_n = 1$ for all odd $n$ and $a_n = 0$ for all even $n$ from $n = 2004$ onwards.\n\n5. **Backward Calculation from $a_3$:**\n\n- To determine $a_3$, we need to find $a_2$ and $a_1$. We know that $a_4 = |a_3 - a_2|$, $a_5 = |a_4 - a_3|$, and $a_6 = |a_5 - a_4|$. Using the given information that $a_6 = 1$, we can solve for $a_3$ and $a_4$ in terms of $a_2$ and $a_1$.\n\n- Since $a_6 = |a_5 - a_4|$, $a_5$ and $a_4$ must either add up to 1 (if they have the same sign) or subtract to 1 (if they have opposite signs).\n\n6. **Expression for $a_6$:**\n\n- We can express $a_6$ as $|(|a_4 - a_3|) - a_4|$. Simplifying this, we get $a_6 = |(-a_3) - a_4|$.\n\n- Since $a_6 = 1$, it follows that $a_3 + a_4 = 1$ or $-a_3 - a_4 = 1$.\n\n7. **Further Simplification:**\n\n- We can express $a_4$ as $|a_3 - a_2|$ and $a_5$ as $|a_4 - a_3|$.\n\n- Substituting $a_4$ and $a_5$ in the equation $a_3 + a_4 = 1$ or $-a_3 - a_4 = 1$, we can solve for $a_2$.\n\n8. **Solving for $a_2$:**\n\n- After simplification, we get two possible equations $a_3 + |a_3 - a_2| = 1$ and $-a_3 + |a_3 - a_2| = 1$.\n\n- Solving these equations, we get two possible ranges for $a_2$: $a_1 - a_3 + 1 \\le a_2 \\le a_1$ and $a_1 - a_3 \\le a_2 \\le a_1 - a_3 + 1$.\n\n- Since $a_2$ is an integer and $a_1 = 999$, the number of possible $a_2$ is the number of integers in these ranges.\n\n- The number of integers in the first range is $999 - (999 - a_3 + 1) + 1$ which is $a_3$, and the number of integers in the second range is $(999 - a_3) - (999 - a_3 + 1) + 1$ which is also $a_3$.\n\n9. **Calculating Final Answer:**\n\n- Since both ranges contain the same number of integers, we need to find the number of integers in one of the ranges.\n\n- It turns out that the first range is the one that contains $a_3$ integers.\n\n- Thus, the total number of possible $a_2$ is $\\boxed{199}$"
