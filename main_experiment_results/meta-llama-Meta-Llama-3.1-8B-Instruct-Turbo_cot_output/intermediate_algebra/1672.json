    "problem": "The domain of the function $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$ is $[0,\\infty)$. What is the range?",
    "solution": "We have $q(x) = (x^2+2)^2$. We wish to determine the set of all $y$ for which $q(x)=y$ has solutions. We must have $y\\ge 0$, since $q(x)$ is a square and squares are nonnegative. Under the assumption $y\\ge 0$, we have:\n$$\\begin{array}{r r@{~=~}l}\n& y & (x^2+2)^2 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & \\sqrt y & x^2+2 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & \\sqrt y-2 & x^2 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$We see that $\\sqrt y-2\\ge 0$ because squares are nonnegative. Thus, we need $y\\ge 4$. When $y\\ge 4$, we have $y=q(x)$ by setting $x$ equal to either of $\\pm \\sqrt{\\sqrt y-2}$, and so any $y\\ge 4$ can be achieved.\n\nTherefore, the range of $q(x)$ is $\\boxed{[4,\\infty)}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the range of the function $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$, we need to consider the possible values of $q(x)$ as $x$ varies over the domain $[0,\\infty)$. \n\nStep 1: Since the function is a polynomial, it is continuous and defined for all $x$ in the domain.\n\nStep 2: The function $q(x)$ is a sum of three terms, each of which is a function of $x$. \n\nStep 3: Consider the term $x^4$. As $x$ increases from $0$ to $\\infty$, $x^4$ also increases from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n\nStep 4: Now consider the term $4x^2$. As $x$ increases from $0$ to $\\infty$, $4x^2$ also increases from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n\nStep 5: Adding these terms, we get $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$. \n\nStep 6: Since both $x^4$ and $4x^2$ are non-negative and increase from $0$ to $\\infty$, the sum $x^4 + 4x^2$ also increases from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n\nStep 7: Adding the constant term $4$ to this sum, we get $q(x) = (x^4 + 4x^2) + 4$.\n\nStep 8: Since the sum $x^4 + 4x^2$ increases from $0$ to $\\infty$, the value of $q(x)$ also increases from $4$ to $\\infty$.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the range of the function $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$ is $[4,\\infty)$."
