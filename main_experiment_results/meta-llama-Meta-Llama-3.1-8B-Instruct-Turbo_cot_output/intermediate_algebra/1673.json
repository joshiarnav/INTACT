    "problem": "If $a$ is a nonzero integer and $b$ is a positive number such that $ab^2=\\log_{10} b$, what is the median of the set $\\{0, 1, a, b,\n1/b\\}$?",
    "solution": "Because $b<10^b$ for all $b>0$, it follows that $\\log_{10}b<b$.  If $b\\geq 1$, then $0<\\left(\\log_{10}b\\right)/b^2<1$, so $a$ cannot be an integer. Therefore $0<b<1$, so $\\log_{10}b<0$ and $a =\n\\left(\\log_{10}b\\right)/b^2<0$.  Thus $a<0<b<1<1/b$, and the median of the set is $\\boxed{b}$.\n\nNote that the conditions of the problem can be met with $b = 0.1$ and $a = -100$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the median of the set $\\{0, 1, a, b, 1/b\\}$, we first need to understand the properties of the given equation and its restrictions on the variables $a$ and $b$. \n\nThe given equation is $ab^2 = \\log_{10} b$. \n\nFirst, we note that $b$ must be positive and not 1 because $\\log_{10} 1 = 0$, and for the equation to hold, $ab^2$ must not be 0.\n\nNext, we consider the possible values of $b$. If $b < 1$, then $\\log_{10} b$ is negative. Since $b^2$ is positive, $ab^2$ would be negative, which is not possible for the value of $\\log_{10} b$. Therefore, we can conclude that $b > 1$.\n\nNow, we consider the possible values of $b$ in the range $1 < b < 10$. If $1 < b < 10$, then the value of $\\log_{10} b$ would be positive but less than 1. In this case, $ab^2$ could be positive, and the equation $ab^2 = \\log_{10} b$ could hold true.\n\nHowever, if $b \\geq 10$, then the value of $\\log_{10} b$ would be greater than or equal to 1. This would imply that $ab^2 \\geq 1$, which is not possible because $b^2$ is greater than 1, and the only way to make the product $ab^2$ less than 1 is if $a$ is negative.\n\nHowever, we are given that $b$ is positive, which would mean $a$ must be negative for the given equation to be satisfied when $b \\geq 10$. But, we are also given that $a$ is a nonzero integer, so $a$ cannot be 0, which contradicts our previous statement. This is a contradiction, which means our assumption of $b \\geq 10$ is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $1 < b < 10$.\n\nNow, we can order the given set $\\{0, 1, a, b, 1/b\\}$ as follows:\n\n* $0$ is the smallest element.\n* $1$ is the second smallest element.\n* $a$ can be either positive or negative, but since $b > 1$, we can conclude that $b > a$. Also, since $1 < b < 10$, we can conclude that $1/b < a$ and $1/b < 1$.\n* $b$ is the largest element because $b > 1$ and $1 < b < 10$.\n* $1/b$ is the second largest element because $1 < b < 10$, which implies $1/b < b$.\n\nNow, we can list the set in order from smallest to largest as follows:\n\n$\\{0, 1, 1/b, a, b\\}$\n\nSince there are an odd number of elements in the set, the median is the middle element. \n\nIn this case, the median is $\\boxed{1/b}$.\n\nNote: The median is 1/b when a is negative."
