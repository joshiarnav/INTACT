    "model_solution": "To find the ordered triple $(a,b,c)$, let's examine the graph of $y = g(x)$ and compare it to the graph of $y = f(x)$.\n\nFrom the graph of $y = g(x)$, we can see that it is a horizontally stretched version of the graph of $y = f(x)$ and has been shifted down by 4 units.\n\nSince the graph of $y = g(x)$ is a horizontally stretched version of the graph of $y = f(x)$, this implies that $b < 1$, as stretching a graph horizontally corresponds to a scaling factor less than 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the vertical shift. The graph of $y = g(x)$ has been shifted down by 4 units, so we have $c = -4$.\n\nTo find the value of $a$, let's consider the vertical scaling factor. Since the graph of $y = g(x)$ is a vertically scaled version of the graph of $y = f(x)$, the vertical distance between corresponding points on the two graphs is $a$ times the vertical distance between corresponding points on the graph of $y = f(x)$. \n\nFrom the graph of $y = g(x)$, we can see that the graph of $y = f(x)$ has been scaled vertically by a factor of $1$ (since it is not stretched or compressed vertically), and we can also see that the vertical distance between the top and bottom of the semi-circle is 4 units on the graph of $y = g(x)$. \n\nWe also know that on the graph of $y = f(x)$, the vertical distance between the top and bottom of the semi-circle is 4 units. Therefore, the vertical distance between the top and bottom of the semi-circle on the graph of $y = g(x)$ is equal to the vertical distance between the top and bottom of the semi-circle on the graph of $y = f(x)$.\n\nHowever, the vertical distance between the top and bottom of the semi-circle on the graph of $y = g(x)$ is 4 units, and the vertical distance between the top and bottom of the semi-circle on the graph of $y = f(x)$ is 4 units. Therefore, the vertical scaling factor $|a|$ is equal to $1$.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the case where $b$ is negative. In this case, the graph of $y = g(x)$ will be a reflection of the graph of $y = f(x)$ across the y-axis, followed by a horizontal stretch. The vertical distance between the top and bottom of the semi-circle on the graph of $y = g(x)$ is still 4 units, and the vertical distance between the top and bottom of the semi-circle on the graph of $y = f(x)$ is still 4 units. Therefore, the vertical scaling factor $|a|$ is still equal to $1$.\n\nSince the vertical distance between corresponding points on the graphs of $y = g(x)$ and $y = f(x)$ is $a$ times the vertical distance between corresponding points on the graph of $y = f(x)$, we have $a = 1$.\n\nNow, let's consider the horizontal scaling factor. We can see that the graph of $y = g(x)$ is a horizontally stretched version of the graph of $y = f(x)$. To find the horizontal scaling factor $b$, let's consider the x-coordinates of the points at which the graph of $y = f(x)$ intersects the x-axis.\n\nThe graph of $y = f(x)$ intersects the x-axis at the points $(-3,0)$ and $(3,0)$. The graph of $y = g(x)$ intersects the x-axis at the points $(-6,0)$ and $(6,0)$.\n\nWe can see that the x-coordinate of the leftmost point of intersection of the graph of $y = g(x)$ is $-6$, and the x-coordinate of the leftmost point of intersection of the graph of $y = f(x)$ is $-3$. Therefore, the horizontal scaling factor $b$ is equal to $\\frac{-3}{-6} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the ordered triple $(a,b,c)$ is $\\boxed{(1, \\frac{1}{2}, -4)}$."
