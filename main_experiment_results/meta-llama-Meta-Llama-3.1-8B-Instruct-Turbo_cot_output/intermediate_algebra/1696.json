    "solution": "Since $z^2 = 24-32i$, we must have $|z^2| = |24-32i| = |8(3-4i)| = 8|3-4i| = 8(5) = 40$.  We also have $|z|^2 = |z|\\cdot |z| = |(z)(z)| = |z^2|$, so $|z^2| = 40$ means that $|z|^2 = 40$, which gives us $|z| = \\sqrt{40} = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find $|z|$, we first need to find the magnitude of $z^2$. \n\nThe given equation is $z^2 = 24-32i$. \n\nThe magnitude of a complex number $a + bi$ is $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.\n\nSo, the magnitude of $z^2$ is $\\sqrt{24^2 + (-32)^2} = \\sqrt{576 + 1024} = \\sqrt{1600} = 40$.\n\nNow, we know that $|z^2| = |z|^2$, as the magnitude of a product is the product of the magnitudes. \n\nTherefore, $|z|^2 = 40$.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $|z| = \\sqrt{40} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10} = 2\\sqrt{10}$.\n\nSo, the magnitude of $z$ is $2\\sqrt{10}$."
