    "model_solution": "To find the value of the given expression, let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe expression is a product of terms in the form of (1 - 1/n), where n ranges from 2 to 100.\n\nLet's simplify each term:\n\n1. (1 - 1/2) = 1/2\n2. (1 - 1/3) = 2/3\n3. (1 - 1/4) = 3/4\n...\n(n - 1)/n\n\nNotice a pattern in the simplified terms. The numerator of each term is one less than the denominator. \n\nSo, the given expression can be rewritten as:\n\n(1/2) * (2/3) * (3/4) * ... * ((n-1)/n) * ... * ((99-1)/100)\n\nWe can cancel out the common terms in the numerator and denominator of consecutive fractions.\n\nFor example, the 2 in the numerator of (2/3) cancels out the 2 in the denominator of (1/2), and so on.\n\nAfter cancellation, the expression simplifies to:\n\n(1/100)\n\nSo, the value of the given expression is 1/100."
