    "problem": "A parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is reflected about the $x$-axis. The parabola and its reflection are translated horizontally five units in opposite directions to become the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$, respectively. Which of the following describes the graph of $y=(f+g)(x)$?\n\n(A) a parabola tangent to the $x$-axis\n(B) a parabola not tangent to the $x$-axis\n(C) a horizontal line\n(D) a non-horizontal line\n(E) the graph of a cubic function",
    "solution": "Write the equation of the original parabola as $y = a(x - h)^2 + k,$ where $a \\neq 0.$  Then the equation of the reflected parabola is\n\\[y = -a(x - h)^2 - k.\\]When the parabolas are translated horizontally by 5 units, in opposite directions, their equations become\n\\[y = a(x - h \\pm 5)^2 + k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -a(x - h \\mp 5)^2 - k.\\]The sum of these expressions is\n\\[\\pm 20ax \\mp 20ah = \\pm 20a (x - h),\\]which is the equation of a non-horizontal line.  The answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(D)}}.$",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's start by understanding the transformations applied to the original parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$.\n\n1. Reflection about the x-axis:\n   The new equation after reflection about the x-axis is $y=-ax^2-bx-c$.\n\n2. Translation of the original parabola five units to the right:\n   The equation of the translated parabola is $y=a(x-5)^2+b(x-5)+c$. This is equivalent to $y=a(x^2-10x+25)+bx-5b+c$, or $y=ax^2-(10a+b)x+(25a-b+5c)$.\n\n3. Translation of the reflected parabola five units to the left:\n   The equation of the translated parabola is $y=-a(x+5)^2-b(x+5)-c$. This is equivalent to $y=-a(x^2+10x+25)-bx-5b-c$, or $y=-ax^2-(10a+b)x-(25a+b+5c)$.\n\nNow, let's find the equation of $y=(f+g)(x)$, which is the sum of the equations of $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$.\n\n$(f+g)(x) = (ax^2-(10a+b)x+(25a-b+5c)) + (-ax^2-(10a+b)x-(25a+b+5c))$\n\n$= 2(-10a-b)x + (25a-b+5c - 25a-b-5c)$\n\n$= -20a-2b$\n\nThe resulting equation is linear, not quadratic, which means the graph of $y=(f+g)(x)$ is a non-horizontal line.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{(D)}$."
