    "model_solution": "To solve the equation, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate one of the radicals\nWe can isolate $\\sqrt{x - 1}$ by subtracting $\\sqrt[3]{2 - x}$ from both sides:\n$\\sqrt{x - 1} = 1 - \\sqrt[3]{2 - x}$\n\nStep 2: Square both sides to remove the radical\nTo remove the radical, we can square both sides of the equation:\n$(\\sqrt{x - 1})^2 = \\left(1 - \\sqrt[3]{2 - x}\\right)^2$\n\nStep 3: Simplify the squared equation\nExpanding the squared expressions gives us:\n$x - 1 = 1 - 2\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} + (2 - x)^{2/3}$\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation\nCombining like terms and rearranging the equation gives us:\n$2\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} = x + 2 - (2 - x)^{2/3}$\n\nStep 5: Cube both sides to remove the radical\nTo remove the radical, we can cube both sides of the equation:\n$\\left(2\\sqrt[3]{2 - x}\\right)^3 = \\left(x + 2 - (2 - x)^{2/3}\\right)^3$\n\nStep 6: Simplify the cubed equation\nExpanding the cubed expressions gives us:\n$8(2 - x) = \\left(x + 2 - (2 - x)^{2/3}\\right)^3$\n\nStep 7: Expand the equation\nExpanding the cubed expression gives us:\n$8(2 - x) = x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8 - 3x^2(2 - x)^{2/3} - 6x(2 - x)^{2/3} - 3(2 - x)^{4/3}$\n\nStep 8: Move all terms to one side to set the equation equal to 0\nSimplifying the equation and moving all terms to one side gives us:\n$x^3 + 3x^2 - 22x - 8 + 3x^2(2 - x)^{2/3} + 6x(2 - x)^{2/3} + 3(2 - x)^{4/3} = 0$\n\nStep 9: Solve the equation\nUnfortunately, this equation is complicated and difficult to solve. We can try to find an approximate solution.\n\nHowever, we can go back to Step 1 and try to find an exact solution by using a different method. Let's try to substitute $x = 1$ into the original equation:\n$\\sqrt[3]{2 - 1} + \\sqrt{1 - 1} = 1$\n$\\sqrt[3]{1} + \\sqrt{0} = 1$\n$1 + 0 = 1$\n\nSince $x = 1$ is a solution to the original equation, we can try to factor the equation.\n\nStep 10: Factor the equation\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n$\\sqrt[3]{2 - x} = 1 - \\sqrt{x - 1}$\n\nStep 11: Cube both sides to remove the radical\nCubing both sides of the equation gives us:\n$2 - x = (1 - \\sqrt{x - 1})^3$\n\nStep 12: Expand the equation\nExpanding the cubed expression gives us:\n$2 - x = 1 - 3\\sqrt{x - 1} + 3(x - 1) - (x - 1)^{3/2}$\n\nStep 13: Simplify the equation\nRearranging the equation gives us:\n$-x + 2 = -3\\sqrt{x - 1} + 2x - 2 - (x - 1)^{3/2}$\n\nStep 14: Move all terms to one side to set the equation equal to 0\nSimplifying the equation and moving all terms to one side gives us:\n$x + 3\\sqrt{x - 1} - 2x + (x - 1)^{3/2} = 0$\n\nStep 15: Factor the equation\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n$(x - 1)^{3/2} + 3\\sqrt{x - 1} - x = 0$\n\nStep 16: Let $y = \\sqrt{x - 1}$\nWe can let $y = \\sqrt{x - 1}$ and rewrite the equation as:\n$y^3 + 3y - x = 0$\n\nStep 17: Substitute $x = y^2 + 1$ into the equation\nSubstituting $x = y^2 + 1$ into the equation gives us:\n$y^3 + 3y - y^2 - 1 = 0$\n\nStep 18: Rearrange the equation\nRearranging the equation gives us:\n$y^3 + 2y - y^2 - 1 = 0$\n\nStep 19: Factor the equation\nWe can factor the equation as:\n$(y - 1)(y^2 + y + 1) = 0$\n\nStep 20: Find the solutions\nSince $(y - 1)(y^2 + y + 1) = 0$, either $y - 1 = 0$ or $y^2 + y + 1 = 0$.\n\nIf $y - 1 = 0$, then $y = 1$, and $x = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nIf $y^2 + y + 1 = 0$, then $y^2 + y + 1 = 0$, which has no real solution.\n\nTherefore, the only solution to the original equation is $x = 2$."
