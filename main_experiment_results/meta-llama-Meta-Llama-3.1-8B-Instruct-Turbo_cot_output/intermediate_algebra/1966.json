We can express the terms as follows:\n\n- $a_1 = 1$\n- $a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r = 1 \\cdot r = r$\n- $a_3 = a_2 \\cdot r = r \\cdot r = r^2$\n\nNow, let's find the expression for $4a_2 + 5a_3$ in terms of $r$:\n\n$4a_2 + 5a_3 = 4r + 5r^2$\n\nThis is a quadratic expression in terms of $r$. To find the smallest possible value of this expression, we can use the concept of completing the square or use calculus. However, since this is a quadratic expression, we can also use the vertex form to find the minimum value.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the expression as a quadratic in vertex form:\n\nLet $f(r) = 4r + 5r^2$. To find the vertex, we can use the formula $r = \\frac{-b}{2a}$, where $a = 5$ and $b = 4$.\n\n$r = \\frac{-4}{2 \\cdot 5} = -\\frac{4}{10} = -\\frac{2}{5}$\n\nNow, let's substitute this value back into the original expression to find the minimum value:\n\n$f(-\\frac{2}{5}) = 4(-\\frac{2}{5}) + 5(-\\frac{2}{5})^2$\n$f(-\\frac{2}{5}) = -\\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{20}{25}$\n$f(-\\frac{2}{5}) = -\\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{4}{5}$\n$f(-\\frac{2}{5}) = -\\frac{4}{5}$\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $4a_2 + 5a_3$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{4}{5}}$."
