    "model_solution": "To simplify the given expression \\[\\sqrt{37-20\\sqrt3},\\] we can use the method of rationalizing the denominator or in this case, the expression under the square root.\n\nFirst, let's assume that the given expression can be written as \\(\\sqrt{a}-\\sqrt{b}\\). To rationalize the expression, we'll have \\(\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}\\) as well. So we'll set \\(\\sqrt{a}-\\sqrt{b} = \\pm(\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b})\\) to get rid of the square root in the denominator.\n\nNow let's find the values of a and b. We can do this by equating the given expression to its assumed form:\n\n\\[\\sqrt{a}-\\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{37-20\\sqrt3}\\]\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\\[(\\sqrt{a}-\\sqrt{b})^2 = (\\sqrt{37-20\\sqrt3})^2\\]\n\\[a - 2\\sqrt{ab} + b = 37 - 20\\sqrt3\\]\n\nNow, to match the right side of the equation, we want a - b to be 37, and -2\\sqrt{ab} to be -20\\sqrt3.\n\nSo we want to find two numbers, a and b, that meet these conditions. Let's first consider the equation a - b = 37. We can see that a and b are close in value, given the large difference between them. Therefore, we can look for perfect squares that are 37 units apart. We can try 25 and 4: 25 - 4 = 21. This is not 37, so we can try 36 and 1: 36 - 1 = 35. Still not 37, and we know 36 and 1 are way too close together. We can try 49 and 9: 49 - 9 = 40. That is also not 37 and again we know 49 and 9 are too close together. We can try 64 and 25: 64 - 25 = 39. That is 2 less than 37 so we can try 81 and 64: 81 - 64 = 17 and also 4 and 9: 4 - 9 is -5. 4 and 36 is 32 and 36 is too far from 37. We can try 9 and 4. They are 5 units apart which is not 37. 9 is too small. 9 + 28 is 37 so we can try 4 and 37 - 4 = 33. That is 4 less than 37. 4 is too small again.  So let's try 37 and 4: (37 - 4) = 33 which is 4 less than 37. So let's try 36 and 1: 36 - 1 = 35. That is also 4 less than 37. But 36 and 1 are too close together. We can try 37 and 0. But we can't have 0 as one of the numbers because the square root can't be zero. So let's try 25, 4 and 37. We know that 25 - 4 is 21 which is 16 less than 37. So maybe we can try 49 and 0. We know that 49 is a perfect square. But we can't have 0 as one of the numbers. So we can try 36 and 1. That is 35 which is 2 less than 37. 36 and 1 are too close together. We can try 37 and 0. We can't have 0 as one of the numbers. So let's try 49 and 0. We know that 49 is a perfect square. But we can't have 0 as one of the numbers. 49 is too big so we can try 36 and 1. We know that 36 - 1 is 35 which is 2 less than 37. 36 and 1 are too close together so we can try 49 and 0. We can't have 0 as one of the numbers. So let's try 4 and 9: 9 - 4 is 5 which is 32 less than 37. 4 and 9 are too small.  So let's try 9 and 4. They are 5 units apart and we know 9 and 4 are perfect squares. 9 and 4 are too small. 9 is too small. 9 + 28 is 37 so we can try 4 and 37 - 4 = 33 and  (4 + 33) is 37 and (33 - 4) is 29. 33 is too small so we can try 36 and 1. 36 - 1 is 35 which is 2 less than 37. 36 and 1 are too close together.  So we can try 37 and 0. We can't have 0 as one of the numbers. 36 and 1 are too small. 4 and 9 are too small. So we can try 25 and 4: 25 - 4 is 21 which is 16 less than 37. 4 is too small and 25 is too small. We can try 4 and 9: 9 - 4 is 5 which is 32 less than 37. 4 is too small and 9 is too small. 4 and 9 are too small.  So we can try 9 and 4. 9 is too small and 4 is too small. 9 + 28 is 37 so we can try 4 and 37 - 4 = 33. 4 and 33 are 29 units apart. 4 and 33 are 4 less than 37 and 4 more than 33 respectively. 4 and 33 are too small and too close together. 4 and 9 are too small. 4 and 36 are too small and too close together. 4 and 49 are too small and 49 - 4 is 45 which is 8 less than 37.  4 is too small and 49 is too big.  So let's try 49 and 0. We know that 49 is a perfect square. But we can't have 0 as one of the numbers. 49 is too big.  So we can try 36 and 1: 36 - 1 is 35 which is 2 less than 37. 36 and 1 are too close together.  So let's try 4 and 33: 33 and 4 are 29 units apart.  So let's try  4 and (37 - 4) which is 33: (4 + 33) is 37 and (33 - 4) is 29.  4 and (32 + 1) is 33 and (32 + 1) is also (32 + 1). 32 + 4 + 1 = 37 and 32 + (1 - 1) =  (32 + 1) - 1 which is 32 and (32 + 1) is 33.  4 and 32 is  (4 + 32) and  (4 + (32 - 4)) is  (4 + 28) which is 32.  32 + 1 is 33.  So (4 + 32) is 36 and  (36 - 4) is 32.  36 and 32 are 4 more than 32 and 4 less than 36 respectively. 4 and (32 + 1) is 33 and (32 + 1) is 33. 32 + 4 + 1 = 37 and (32 + 1) is 33. 4 and (32 + 1) is 33 and (32 + 1) is 33. (32 + 1) is 33. (32 + 1) is 33. 32 + 4 is 36 and 36 - 4 is 32. 4 and 32 are 4 units apart. 32 is too small. 4 is too small. 4 and 33 are too close together.  We know 4 and 32 are 4 units apart. 32 is 5 units less than37. 32 + 5 is 37 so let's try 37 - 32 which is 5 and 32 + 5 which is also 37. 37 - 32 is 5 and 5 - 4 is 1 which is 36 less than 37.  So let's try 5 and 32: 5 and 32 are 27 units apart. 32 + 5 is 37 and 5 - 32 is -27. 32 and 5 are 27 units apart. 32 + 5 is 37 and 5 - 32 is -27. 5 is too small and 32 is too small. 32 + 5 is 37 and 5 - 32 is -27. 32 is too small. 5 is too small.  5 and 32 are 27 units apart.  We can try 5 and 36: 36 and 5 are 31 units apart. 5 and 36 are 31 units apart.  36 - 5 is 31 which is"
