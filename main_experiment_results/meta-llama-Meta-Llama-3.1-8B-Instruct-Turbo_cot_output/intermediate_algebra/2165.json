    "model_solution": "To find the remainder, we can use polynomial long division or the Remainder Theorem. \n\nThe Remainder Theorem states that if a polynomial f(x) is divided by (x - a), then the remainder is f(a). \n\nHowever, in this case, we have a divisor of the form (2x - 6), which can be rewritten as 2(x - 3). \n\nSo, we can apply the Remainder Theorem with a = 3.\n\nFirst, we need to rewrite the divisor as 2(x - 3). \n\nNow, we substitute x = 3 into the polynomial $6x^4-14x^3-4x^2+2x-26$ to find the remainder.\n\nSubstituting x = 3:\n\n$6(3)^4-14(3)^3-4(3)^2+2(3)-26$\n\nExpanding the terms:\n\n$6(81)-14(27)-4(9)+6-26$\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n$486-378-36+6-26$\n\nCombining the terms:\n\n$52$\n\nSo, the remainder when $6x^4-14x^3-4x^2+2x-26$ is divided by $2x - 6$ is 52."
