    "problem": "Let $f(x) = \\frac{x + 6}{x}.$  The sequence $(f_n)$ of functions is defined by $f_1 = f$ and\n\\[f_n = f \\circ f_{n - 1}\\]for all $n \\ge 2.$  For example,\n\\[f_2(x) = f(f(x)) = \\frac{\\frac{x + 6}{x} + 6}{\\frac{x + 6}{x}} = \\frac{7x + 6}{x + 6}\\]and\n\\[f_3(x) = f(f_2(x)) = \\frac{\\frac{7x + 6}{x + 6} + 6}{\\frac{7x + 6}{x + 6}} = \\frac{13x + 42}{7x + 6}.\\]Let $S$ be the set of all real numbers $x$ such that\n\\[f_n(x) = x\\]for some positive integer $n.$  Find the number of elements in $S.$",
    "solution": "First, we solve the equation $f(x) = x.$  This becomes\n\\[\\frac{x + 6}{x} = x,\\]so $x + 6 = x^2,$ or $x^2 - x - 6 = (x - 3)(x + 2) = 0.$  Thus, the solutions are $x = 3$ and $x = -2.$\n\nSince $f(x) = x$ for $x = 3$ and $x = -2,$ $f_n(x) = x$ for $x = 3$ and $x = -2,$ for any positive integer $n.$  Furthermore, it is clear that the function $f_n(x)$ will always be of the form\n\\[f_n(x) = \\frac{ax + b}{cx + d},\\]for some constants $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  The equation $f_n(x) = x$ then becomes\n\\[\\frac{ax + b}{cx + d} = x,\\]or $ax + b = x(cx + d).$  This equation is quadratic, and we know it has roots 3 and $-2,$ so there cannot be any more solutions to the equation $f_n(x) = x.$\n\nTherefore, $S = \\{3,-2\\},$ which contains $\\boxed{2}$ elements.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will first find the fixed points of the function $f(x)$. A fixed point of a function $f(x)$ is a value $x$ such that $f(x) = x$. \n\nWe can find the fixed points by setting the function $f(x) = \\frac{x + 6}{x}$ equal to $x$ and solving for $x$:\n\\[\\frac{x + 6}{x} = x\\]\nCross multiplying gives us:\n\\[x + 6 = x^2\\]\nRearranging terms, we get the quadratic equation:\n\\[x^2 - x - 6 = 0\\]\n\nWe can factor this equation as:\n\\[(x - 3)(x + 2) = 0\\]\n\nThis gives us the solutions $x = 3$ and $x = -2$. Therefore, the fixed points of the function $f(x)$ are $x = 3$ and $x = -2$.\n\nNext, we need to show that these fixed points are also fixed points of all the functions $f_n(x)$. We will prove this by induction.\n\nLet $P(n)$ be the statement that the fixed points of $f_n(x)$ are $x = 3$ and $x = -2$. We have already shown that $P(1)$ is true.\n\nAssume that $P(k)$ is true for some positive integer $k$. We want to show that $P(k + 1)$ is true.\n\nLet $f_k(x)$ be a function such that $x = f_k(x)$ for some real number $x$. This means that $f(f_k(x)) = f(x) = x$. \n\nSince $f_k(x)$ is a fixed point of $f_k(x)$, we can apply the function $f(x)$ to both sides to get:\n\\[f(f_k(x)) = f(x)\\]\nSince $f_k(x)$ is a fixed point of $f_k(x)$, we have $f(f_k(x)) = f(x)$. Therefore, we have:\n\\[f(x) = f_k(x)\\]\n\nNow, we can apply the function $f(x)$ to both sides to get:\n\\[f(f(x)) = f(f_k(x))\\]\nSince $f(f_k(x)) = x$, we have:\n\\[f(f(x)) = x\\]\n\nThis means that $x$ is a fixed point of the function $f_{k + 1}(x) = f(f_k(x))$. Therefore, if $x$ is a fixed point of $f_k(x)$, it is also a fixed point of $f_{k + 1}(x)$.\n\nSince $x = 3$ and $x = -2$ are fixed points of $f(x)$, they are also fixed points of $f_k(x)$ for all positive integers $k$. Therefore, $x = 3$ and $x = -2$ are fixed points of $f_{k + 1}(x)$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $P(k + 1)$ is true, given that $P(k)$ is true.\n\nBy mathematical induction, we have shown that $P(n)$ is true for all positive integers $n$.\n\nTherefore, the set $S$ of all real numbers $x$ such that $f_n(x) = x$ for some positive integer $n$ is equal to the set $\\{ -2, 3 \\}$.\n\nHence, the number of elements in $S$ is $\\boxed{2}$."
