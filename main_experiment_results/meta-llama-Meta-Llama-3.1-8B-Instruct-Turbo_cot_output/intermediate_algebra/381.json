In this case, the common term is $x^6$. Factoring out $x^6$, we get:\n\n$x^6(x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379) = 0$\n\nStep 2: Now, we have two factors: $x^6$ and $(x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379)$. Since we are looking for positive real solutions, we need to consider both factors.\n\nStep 3: The first factor is $x^6$. Since we are looking for positive real solutions, we need to find the values of $x$ that satisfy $x^6 = 0$. However, $x^6 = 0$ only when $x = 0$, which is not a positive real solution. Therefore, we can ignore this factor.\n\nStep 4: Now, let's focus on the second factor: $(x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379)$. We want to find the positive real solutions to this equation.\n\nStep 5: To do this, we can use Descartes' Rule of Signs. This rule states that the number of positive real roots of a polynomial is either equal to the number of sign changes in the coefficients of the polynomial or less than that by an even integer.\n\nStep 6: In the polynomial $(x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379)$, there is only one sign change (from positive to negative). Therefore, according to Descartes' Rule of Signs, there is at most one positive real solution to this equation.\n\nStep 7: To confirm this, we can try to find the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $(x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379) = 0$. We can use numerical methods or approximation techniques to find the roots of the polynomial.\n\nStep 8: After analyzing the polynomial using various methods, we find that there is indeed one positive real root to the equation $(x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379) = 0$.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, combining the results from the two factors, we conclude that there is only one positive real solution to the original equation $x^{10}+7x^9+14x^8+1729x^7-1379x^6=0$.\n\nSo, the answer is: there is 1 positive real solution."
