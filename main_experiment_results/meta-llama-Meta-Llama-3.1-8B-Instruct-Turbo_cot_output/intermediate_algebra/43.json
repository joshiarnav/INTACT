    "solution": "Let $z = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.  Then $|z| = 5$ becomes $x^2 + y^2 = 25,$ and $f(z) = z$ becomes\n\\[i(x - yi) = x + yi.\\]Then $ix + y = x + yi,$ so $x = y.$\n\nHence, $2x^2 = 25,$ which has two solutions.  Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ such values of $z.$",

    "model_solution": "We can start by writing the complex number $z$ in terms of its real and imaginary components:\n\n$z = a + bi$\n\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.\n\nThe complex conjugate of $z$ is $\\overline{z} = a - bi$.\n\nThe absolute value of $z$ is given by $|z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. We are given that $|z| = 5$, so we have:\n\n$\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 5$\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n$a^2 + b^2 = 25$\n\nNext, we need to find the values of $z$ that satisfy the equation $f(z) = z$. We are given that $f(z) = i\\overline{z}$, so we have:\n\n$i\\overline{z} = z$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\overline{z}$, we get:\n\n$i(a - bi) = a + bi$\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get:\n\n$ia - bij = a + bi$\n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get:\n\n$ia = a$\n\n$-bij = bi$\n\nSimplifying the first equation, we get:\n\n$a = -ai$\n\nSince $a$ is a real number, we must have $a = 0$ or $i = -1$.\n\nThe second equation is already true, since $b \\neq 0$.\n\nSo, we have $a = 0$ or $b \\neq 0$. However, since $b^2 = 25 - a^2$, we have $b^2 = 25$ if $a = 0$ and $b^2 < 25$ if $a \\neq 0$.\n\nThe only value of $a$ that satisfies the equation $a^2 + b^2 = 25$ is $a = 0$.\n\nTherefore, we have $a = 0$ and $b^2 = 25$, so $b = \\pm 5$.\n\nSo, there are two values of $z$ that satisfy both equations:\n\n$z = 0 + 5i$\n\n$z = 0 - 5i$\n\nTherefore, there are 2 values of $z$ that satisfy both $|z| = 5$ and $f(z) = z$."
