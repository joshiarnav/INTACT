    "model_solution": "To find the ordered pair $(a, b),$ we can use the Remainder Theorem, which states that if a polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by $x - c,$ then the remainder is $f(c).$\n\nGiven that when $f(x)$ is divided by $x - 1,$ the remainder is $-5,$ we can write:\n\n$f(1) = -5$\n\nSubstituting $x = 1$ into the polynomial:\n\n$a(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + b(1) - 5 = -5$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n$a - 6 + b - 5 = -5$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$a + b - 11 = -5$\n\nAdd 11 to both sides:\n\n$a + b = 6$\n\nNow, we will use the fact that when $f(x)$ is divided by $x + 2,$ the remainder is $-53.$ We can write:\n\n$f(-2) = -53$\n\nSubstituting $x = -2$ into the polynomial:\n\n$a(-2)^3 - 6(-2)^2 + b(-2) - 5 = -53$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n$-8a - 24 - 2b - 5 = -53$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$-8a - 2b = -24$\n\nDivide the entire equation by -2:\n\n$4a + b = 12$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\n$a + b = 6$\n$4a + b = 12$\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $b$:\n\n$(4a + b) - (a + b) = 12 - 6$\n\n$3a = 6$\n\nDivide by 3:\n\n$a = 2$\n\nNow that we have the value of $a$, substitute it into one of the equations to solve for $b$:\n\n$2 + b = 6$\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n$b = 4$\n\nSo, the ordered pair $(a, b)$ is $(2, 4)$."
