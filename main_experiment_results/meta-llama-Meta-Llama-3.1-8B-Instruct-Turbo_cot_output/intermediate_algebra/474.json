    "model_solution": "To find the minimum value of the expression $4x^5 + 5x^{-4}$, we can use the concept of calculus, specifically the derivative of the function.\n\nFirst, let's define the function as:\n\n$f(x) = 4x^5 + 5x^{-4}$\n\nNow, to find the critical points of the function, we need to take the derivative of the function with respect to $x$.\n\nWe'll use the power rule for differentiation, which states that if $f(x) = x^n$, then $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$.\n\nUsing this rule, we can find the derivative of the function $f(x)$:\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (4x^5 + 5x^{-4})$\n$f'(x) = 20x^4 - 20x^{-5}$\n\nTo find the critical points, we need to set the derivative equal to zero and solve for $x$:\n\n$20x^4 - 20x^{-5} = 0$\n\nWe can factor out $20x^{-5}$ from the equation:\n\n$20x^{-5}(x^9 - 1) = 0$\n\nSince we know that $x$ is a positive real number, we can divide both sides of the equation by $20x^{-5}$:\n\n$x^9 - 1 = 0$\n\nNow, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation:\n\n$x^9 = 1$\n\nTaking the ninth root of both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n$x = \\sqrt[9]{1}$\n\n$x = 1$\n\nNow that we have found the critical point, we need to verify if it corresponds to a minimum, maximum, or neither.\n\nTo do this, we can use the second derivative test. We'll find the second derivative of the function $f(x)$:\n\n$f''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (20x^4 - 20x^{-5})$\n$f''(x) = 80x^3 + 100x^{-6}$\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the second derivative at the critical point $x = 1$:\n\n$f''(1) = 80(1)^3 + 100(1)^{-6}$\n$f''(1) = 80 + 100$\n$f''(1) = 180$\n\nSince the second derivative is positive at the critical point $x = 1$, we can conclude that the function has a local minimum at this point.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the expression $4x^5 + 5x^{-4}$ occurs when $x = 1$.\n\nWe can substitute this value of $x$ into the original expression to find the minimum value:\n\n$f(1) = 4(1)^5 + 5(1)^{-4}$\n$f(1) = 4 + 5$\n$f(1) = 9$\n\nSo, the minimum value of the expression $4x^5 + 5x^{-4}$ is 9."
