    "model_solution": "To determine $a_{2009}$ given the given conditions, we start by rearranging the given equation:\n\n$a_n = \\frac{a_{n - 1}}{a_{n + 1}}.$ \n\nSince we're looking for a pattern or way to relate the terms of the sequence, we'll write the equation for $a_n$ and $a_{n - 1}$:\n\n$a_n = \\frac{a_{n - 1}}{a_{n + 1}}$\n\n$a_{n-1} = \\frac{a_{n - 2}}{a_{n}}.$\n\nFrom the first equation, we can see that $a_n$ is the ratio of $a_{n-1}$ to $a_{n+1}$, and $a_{n-1}$ is the ratio of $a_{n-2}$ to $a_n$.\n\nSubstituting the value of $a_{n-1}$ from the second equation into the first, we get\n\n$\\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_{n+1}} = \\frac{\\frac{a_{n-2}}{a_n}}{a_{n+1}}.$\n\nCross-multiplying, we get\n\n$a_{n-1}a_{n+1} = \\frac{a_{n-2}}{a_n}.$\n\nSince $a_n = a_{n-1}a_{n+1}$, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n$a_{n-1}a_{n+1} = \\frac{a_{n-2}}{a_{n-1}a_{n+1}}.$\n\nNow, we can cancel the common factors of $a_{n-1}a_{n+1}$:\n\n$1 = \\frac{a_{n-2}}{a_{n-1}a_{n+1}}.$\n\nThis shows that $a_{n-1}a_{n+1} = a_{n-2}$.\n\nThis relationship gives us a way to relate the terms of the sequence with a difference of 2 in the index: \n\n$a_{n-2} = a_{n-1}a_{n+1}.$\n\nNow we are given $a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$ and $a_{1} = 1 + \\sqrt{7}.$\n\nWe need to find $a_{2009}$.\n\nLet's use the relationship we found above to relate the terms of the sequence with a difference of 2 in the index.\n\n$a_{1775} = \\frac{a_{1774}}{a_{1776}} = \\frac{a_{1774}}{13 + \\sqrt{7}}.$\n\n$a_{1774} = a_{1773}a_{1775}.$\n\nThen,\n$a_{1773} = a_{1772}a_{1774}.$\n\nNow, we are subtracting 1 from each index. Continuing this process by decreasing the index by 1 until we reach $a_1$, the terms will cancel out. \n\n$a_{1772} = a_{1771}a_{1773},$\n\n$a_{1771} = a_{1770}a_{1772},$\n\n...\n\n$a_{2} = a_{1}a_{3}.$\n\nGiven that $a_{n-2} = a_{n-1}a_{n+1}$, we can substitute the value of $a_3$ in terms of $a_1$ and $a_5$ into the equation for $a_2$:\n\n$a_{2} = a_{1}a_{3} = a_{1}a_{4}a_{2}.$\n\nNow we can cancel the $a_2$ term:\n\n$a_{2} = a_{1}a_{4}.$\n\nNow, we need to express $a_4$ in terms of $a_2$ and $a_6$ using the relationship $a_{n-2} = a_{n-1}a_{n+1}$:\n\n$a_{4} = \\frac{a_{3}}{a_{5}}.$\n\nSubstituting $a_3$ in terms of $a_1$ and $a_5$ into the equation for $a_4$, we get\n\n$a_{4} = \\frac{a_{1}a_{5}}{a_{5}} = a_{1}.$\n\nNow we can substitute this expression into the equation for $a_2$:\n\n$a_{2} = a_{1}a_{4} = a_{1}a_{1}.$\n\nSo, we have expressed $a_2$ in terms of $a_1$.\n\nGiven the value $a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$ and $a_{1} = 1 + \\sqrt{7},$ we can observe that the sequence repeats every 6 steps:\n\n$a_{1} = a_{1+6k}$\n\n$a_{2} = a_{2+6k}$\n\n...\n\n$a_{6} = a_{1+6k}$\n\nTherefore, we can reduce the problem of finding $a_{2009}$ to finding the equivalent term in the 6-step cycle.\n\nTo do this, we'll express $2009$ as $6k + r$ for some integer $k$ and remainder $r$.\n\n$2009 = 6(335) + 1$\n\nSo, we can see that the 6-step cycle ends at the index $6(335)$. \n\nTherefore, we have\n\n$a_{2009} = a_{1+1} = a_{2}.$\n\nUsing the relationship $a_{n-2} = a_{n-1}a_{n+1}$, we can find $a_{2}$ in terms of $a_{4}$ and $a_{6}$:\n\n$a_{2} = a_{4}a_{6}.$\n\nSince we know $a_{1}$ and $a_{6}$, we can use the relationship to find $a_{4}$ and $a_{6}$.\n\n$a_{3} = \\frac{a_{2}}{a_{4}} = \\frac{a_{1}a_{4}}{a_{4}} = a_{1}.$\n\nUsing the relationship $a_{n} = a_{n-1}a_{n+1}$, we can write\n\n$a_{3} = \\frac{a_{2}}{a_{4}}.$\n\nWe can substitute the expression for $a_3$ in terms of $a_1$ into this equation:\n\n$a_{1} = \\frac{a_{2}}{a_{4}}.$\n\nNow, we are given $a_{1776} = 13 + \\sqrt{7}$ and $a_{1} = 1 + \\sqrt{7}.$\n\n$a_{1776} = a_{1}a_{1778} = (1 + \\sqrt{7})(a_{1778}) = a_{1777}a_{1779}.$\n\n$a_{1777} = \\frac{a_{1776}}{a_{1779}}.$\n\n$a_{1778} = a_{1777}a_{1779} = \\frac{a_{1776}}{a_{1776}} = 1.$\n\nSince $a_1 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$ and $a_6 = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$, the sequence repeats every 6 steps.\n\nTherefore, we have\n\n$a_{2009} = a_{2}.$\n\nNow, we can use the relationship $a_{n} = a_{n-1}a_{n+1}$ to find $a_{2}$:\n\n$a_{2} = a_{1}a_{4}.$\n\nGiven that $a_{1} = 1 + \\sqrt{7}$ and $a_{4} = a_{1}$, we can substitute the value of $a_{1}$ into the equation:\n\n$a_{2} = (1 + \\sqrt{7})^{2}.$\n\nThen\n\n$a_{2009} = (1 + \\sqrt{7})^{2}.$"
