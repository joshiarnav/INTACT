    "problem": "For how many real values of $c$ do we have $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$?",
    "solution": "We have $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\sqrt{{\\frac12}^2 + (-c)^2} = \\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14}$, so $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ gives us $\\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14} = \\frac34$.  Squaring both sides gives $c^2 + \\frac14 = \\frac9{16}$, so $c^2=\\frac5{16}$.  Taking the square root of both sides gives $c = \\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ and $c=-\\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ as solutions, so there are $\\boxed{2}$ real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nWe also could have solved this equation by noting that $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ means that the complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is $\\frac34$ units from the origin in the complex plane.  Therefore, it is on the circle centered at the origin with radius $\\frac34$.  The complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is also on the vertical line that intersects the real axis at $\\frac12$, which is inside the aforementioned circle.  Since this line goes inside the circle, it must intersect the circle at $\\boxed{2}$ points, which correspond to the values of $c$ that satisfy the original equation.",

    "model_solution": "To solve the equation $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Rewrite the absolute value in terms of the distance formula:\n $$\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + (-c)^2}$$\n2. Set this equal to $\\frac34$ and square both sides:\n   $$\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + (-c)^2} = \\frac34$$\n   $$\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + (-c)^2 = \\left(\\frac34\\right)^2$$\n3. Simplify the equation:\n   $$\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 = \\frac14$$\n   $$(-c)^2 = c^2$$\n   $$\\frac14 + c^2 = \\left(\\frac34\\right)^2$$\n   $$\\frac14 + c^2 = \\frac9{16}$$\n4. Isolate $c^2$ on one side of the equation:\n   $$c^2 = \\frac9{16} - \\frac14$$\n   $$c^2 = \\frac9{16} - \\frac4{16}$$\n   $$c^2 = \\frac5{16}$$\n5. Take the square root of both sides. This will give us two values of $c$, one positive and one negative:\n   $$c = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac5{16}}$$\n6. Simplify the square root:\n   $$c = \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt5}{4}$$\n\nSo, there are two real values of $c$ that satisfy the given equation: $\\frac{\\sqrt5}{4}$ and $-\\frac{\\sqrt5}{4}$."
