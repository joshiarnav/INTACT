    "solution": "An example of a quadratic function with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ is $(x-2)(x-4)$. However, when $x=3$, this function takes the value $-1$. However, multiplying the entire quadratic by $-6$ does not change the location of the zeroes, and does give us the desired value at $x=3$.\n\nThus, $-6(x-2)(x-4)$ has all the desired properties. The expanded form of this expression is $\\boxed{-6x^2+36x-48}$.\n\nNote that this is the only such quadratic. Any quadratic must factor as $a(x-r)(x-s)$, where its zeroes are $r$ and $s$; thus a quadratic with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ must be of the form $a(x-2)(x-4)$, and the coefficient $a=-6$ is forced by the value at $x=3$.",

    "model_solution": "To create a quadratic function with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$, we need to find the factors of the function. Since it has zeroes at these points, the factors will be $(x - 2)$ and $(x - 4)$.\n\nFirst, let's create a basic quadratic function with factors $(x - 2)$ and $(x - 4)$, \n$y = a(x - 2)(x - 4)$.\n\nTo determine the value of $a$, we can use the point $(3, 6)$. When $x = 3$, $y = 6$. So we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\n$6 = a(3 - 2)(3 - 4)$\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n$6 = a(1)(-1)$\n$6 = -a$\n\nMultiplying by $-1$ to isolate $a$, we get:\n\n$a = -6$\n\nNow that we know the value of $a$, we can substitute it back into the basic quadratic function:\n\n$y = -6(x - 2)(x - 4)$\n\nExpanding the function by multiplying out the factors, we get:\n\n$y = -6(x^2 - 6x + 8)$\n\nDistributing the $-6$, we get:\n\n$y = -6x^2 + 36x - 48$\n\nThis is the expanded form of the quadratic function with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$, and that takes the value $6$ when $x=3$."
