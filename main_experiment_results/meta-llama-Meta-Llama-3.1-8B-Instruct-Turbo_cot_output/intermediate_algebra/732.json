    "problem": "You have a rectangular prism box with length $x+5$ units, width $x-5$ units, and height $x^{2}+25$ units. For how many positive integer values of $x$ is the volume of the box less than 700 units?",
    "solution": "To find the volume of the box, we multiply the three dimensions: $(x+5)(x-5)(x^{2}+25) = (x^{2}-25)(x^{2}+25) = x^{4}-625$. We want to find $x$ such that $x^{4}-625<700$, which simplifies to $x^{4}<1325$. Taking the fourth root shows us that $x$ is less than $\\sqrt[4]{1325}$, which is between 6 and 7 (since $6^4=1296$ while $7^4=2401$). So $x$ could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, we see that the width is $x-5$ units, and this must be a positive number, so the only value of $x$ which works is 6. Thus, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ possible value of $x$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of the box, we multiply its length, width, and height:\n\nVolume = (length) * (width) * (height)\n= (x + 5) * (x - 5) * (x^2 + 25)\n\nWe can simplify this expression using the difference of squares formula (a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)):\n\nVolume = (x^2 - 25) * (x^2 + 25)\n= (x^2)^2 - (25)^2\n= x^4 - 625\n\nNow we want to find the values of x for which the volume is less than 700. So we set up the inequality:\n\nx^4 - 625 < 700\n\nAdd 625 to both sides to get:\n\nx^4 < 1325\n\nNow we take the fourth root of both sides to get:\n\nx < \u221c1325\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nx < 6.88\n\nSince x must be a positive integer, we need to find the positive integers less than 6.88. These are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nHowever, we also need to make sure that the width of the box (x - 5) is positive, since it cannot be negative. So we need to find the values of x for which x - 5 > 0. This gives us:\n\nx > 5\n\nSo we need to find the positive integers greater than 5 and less than 6.88. These are 6.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 positive integer value of x for which the volume of the box is less than 700 units."
