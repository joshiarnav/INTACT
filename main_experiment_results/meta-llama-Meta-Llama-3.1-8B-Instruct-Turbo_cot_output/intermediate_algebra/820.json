    "solution": "Since the polynomial has no constant term, we can immediately factor out an $x$ from every term\n$$x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20),$$and our first root $x=0$. Let $g(x) = 6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$. Then the remaining roots of our original polynomial are the roots of $g(x)$. By trying out simple values, we can see that $g(0) = 20 > 0$ and $g(1) = 6+19-51+20 = -6<0$. Thus, there must be a root of $g(x)$ between $0$ and $1$. From the Rational Root Theorem, we know that if $g(p/q) = 0$ then $p$ must divide $20$ and $q$ must divide $6$.\n\nChecking rational numbers of the form $p/q$, where $p$ divides $20$ and $q$ divides $6$, and $p/q$ is between $0$ and $1$, we find that\n$$\\begin{aligned} g\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) &= 6\\cdot\\frac{1}{8}+19\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}-51\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}+20 = 0.\n\\end{aligned}$$This means that $2x - 1$ is a factor of $g(x).$ Dividing by $2x-1$ gives us $g(x) = (2x-1)(3x^2+11x-20)$.\n\nThe quadratic $3x^2+11x-20$ factors as $(3x-4)(x+5),$ so our last two roots are $4/3$ and $-5$.\n\nThus, the roots of $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$ are $\\boxed{0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{4}{3}, -5}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the roots of the given polynomial $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$, we can factor out an $x$ from all the terms. This will give us $x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20)$. \n\nNow, we can see that $x=0$ is a root of the polynomial. However, we're left with the cubic polynomial $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$. \n\nTo find the remaining roots, let's try to factor this cubic polynomial. Unfortunately, it's not easy to factor it directly. So, we can try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem tells us that any rational root of the cubic polynomial must be of the form $p/q$, where $p$ is a factor of the constant term (20) and $q$ is a factor of the leading coefficient (6).\n\nThe factors of 20 are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm5, \\pm10, \\pm20$.\nThe factors of 6 are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm3, \\pm6$.\n\nNow, we can try to find the rational roots by dividing the factors of 20 by the factors of 6. This will give us a list of possible rational roots.\n\nAfter checking the possible rational roots, we find that $x=2/3$ is a root of the cubic polynomial.\n\nSo, we can factor the cubic polynomial as $(3x-2)(2x^2+13x-10)$.\n\nNow, we're left with the quadratic polynomial $2x^2+13x-10$. We can try to factor this quadratic polynomial or use the quadratic formula to find its roots.\n\nThe quadratic polynomial $2x^2+13x-10$ can be factored as $(2x-5)(x+2)$.\n\nSo, the roots of the quadratic polynomial are $x=5/2$ and $x=-2$.\n\nTherefore, the roots of the given polynomial $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$ are:\n\n$x=0, x=2/3, x=5/2, x=-2$\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n0, 2/3, 5/2, -2"
