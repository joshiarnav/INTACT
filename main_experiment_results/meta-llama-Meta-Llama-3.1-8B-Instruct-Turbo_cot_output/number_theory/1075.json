    "problem": "Convert $199_{10}$ to base 2. Let $x$ be the number of zeros and $y$ be the number of ones in base 2. What is the value of $y-x?$",
    "solution": "The largest power of 2 that divides $199$ is $2^7$, which equals 128. Since $(1\\cdot 2^7)=128<199<(2\\cdot 2^7)=256$, the digit in the $2^7$ place is $1$. We know that $199-128=71$, and that $71$ can be expressed as $64+4+2+1$, or $(1\\cdot 2^6)+(1\\cdot 2^2)+(1\\cdot 2^1)+(1\\cdot 2^0)$. This means that $199_{10}=11000111_2$. Therefore, $x=3$ and $y=5$; and $y-x=5-3=\\boxed{2}$.",
