    "problem": "What is the digit in the tens place when $7^{2005}$ is expressed in decimal notation?",
    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of the last two digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $07, 49, 43, 01, 07, 49, 43, 01,\\ldots$ . The cycle of the last two digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 numbers long: 07, 49, 43, 01. Thus, to find the tens digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=0$ or 1 corresponds to the tens digit 0, and $R=2$ or 3 corresponds to the units digit 4). Since $2005\\div4=501R1$, the tens digit of $7^{2005}$ is $ \\boxed{0}$.",

    "model_solution": "We'll break this down into manageable steps.\n\nStep 1: Since we want to find the digit in the tens place, we can start by looking at the pattern of the last two digits of the powers of 7.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the first few powers of 7 modulo 100, which will give us the last two digits:\n\n- $7^1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{100}$\n- $7^2 \\equiv 49 \\pmod{100}$\n- $7^3 \\equiv 343 \\equiv 43 \\pmod{100}$\n- $7^4 \\equiv 43 \\cdot 7 \\equiv 301 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$\n\nStep 3: Now, we've found a useful pattern: $7^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$. This means that the last two digits of powers of 7 are cyclic with a period of 4.\n\nStep 4: We need to find the remainder of $2005$ when divided by $4$. \n\n$2005 \\div 4 = 501$ with a remainder of $1$.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the power of 7 we're looking for is congruent to $7^1$ modulo 100, since $2005 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nStep 6: Then the last two digits of $7^{2005}$ are the same as the last two digits of $7^1$, which is 07. Therefore, the digit in the tens place of $7^{2005}$ is 0."
