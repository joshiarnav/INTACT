    "problem": "When an integer is divided by 15, the remainder is 7. Find the sum of the remainders when the same integer is divided by 3 and by 5.",
    "solution": "We let our integer be $n$.  the first sentence tells us that  \\[n\\equiv 7\\pmod {15}.\\] Since 3 and 5 are both factors of 15 we deduce \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv2\\pmod5.\n\\end{align*} Therefore the remainders in question are 1 and 2, and their sum is $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can start by finding an integer that when divided by 15, leaves a remainder of 7. \n\nSince 15 can be factored into 3 * 5, we can use this information to find the remainder when the integer is divided by 3 and 5.\n\nLet's say the integer we're looking for is 'n'. We know that n = 15k + 7, where 'k' is any integer.\n\nNow, when we divide 'n' by 3, it will leave a remainder. To find this remainder, we can divide 15k + 7 by 3.\n\n15k + 7 = 3(5k + 2) + 1\n\nSo, when 'n' is divided by 3, the remainder is 1.\n\nSimilarly, when we divide 'n' by 5, it will leave a remainder. To find this remainder, we can divide 15k + 7 by 5.\n\n15k + 7 = 5(3k + 1) + 2\n\nSo, when 'n' is divided by 5, the remainder is 2.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the remainders when the integer is divided by 3 and 5 is 1 + 2 = 3."
