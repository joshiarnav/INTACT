    "problem": "The American Mathematics College is holding its orientation for incoming freshmen. The incoming freshman class contains fewer than $500$ people. When the freshmen are told to line up in columns of $23$, $22$ people are in the last column. When the freshmen are told to line up in columns of $21$, $14$ people are in the last column. How many people are in the incoming freshman class?",
    "solution": "If $n$ is the number of people in the incoming class, then $n$ yields a remainder of $14$ when divided by $21$. Since both 21 and 14 are divisible by 7, this means that $n$ is divisible by $7$. Define $k=n/7$, and note that $7k \\equiv 14\\pmod{21}$. Dividing by 7, we get $k\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. Multiplying by 7 again, we get $n\\equiv 14\\pmod{3}$, which implies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. So we are looking for a solution to the following system of linear congruences: \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}, \\\\\nn&\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3},\\\\\nn&\\equiv 22 \\pmod{23}. \\\\\n\\end{align*} First, we look for a solution to the last two congruences. Checking numbers that are one less than a multiple of 23, we find that 68 satisfies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $n$ which satisfy both of the last two congruences are precisely those that differ from 68 by a multiple of $3\\cdot 23=69$. Checking $68+69$, $68+2\\cdot 69$, etc. we find that $68 + 5\\cdot 69 = \\boxed{413}$ is the least positive solution to the last two congruences which is also divisible by 7. Note that, by the Chinese remainder theorem again, the solutions of the above system of three congruences are precisely the positive integers that differ from 413 by a multiple of $7\\cdot3\\cdot23=483,$ so 413 is indeed the only solution between 0 and 500.",

    "model_solution": "Let's denote the total number of people in the incoming freshman class as $n$. \n\n1. When the freshmen line up in columns of 23, 22 people are left in the last column. This implies that the total number of people, $n$, leaves a remainder of 22 when divided by 23. In other words, $n = 23m + 22$ for some integer $m$.\n\n2. Similarly, when the freshmen line up in columns of 21, 14 people are left in the last column. This implies that the total number of people, $n$, leaves a remainder of 14 when divided by 21. In other words, $n = 21k + 14$ for some integer $k$.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. $n = 23m + 22$\n2. $n = 21k + 14$\n\nWe can equate the two expressions for $n$:\n\n$23m + 22 = 21k + 14$\n\nSubtracting 14 from both sides:\n\n$23m + 8 = 21k$\n\nSubtracting $8$ from both sides:\n\n$23m = 21k - 8$\n\nNow, we can rewrite this equation as:\n\n$23m + 8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{21}$ \n\nSince $23 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{21}$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$(2m) + 8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{21}$ \n\n$2m \\equiv -8 \\pmod{21}$ \n\n$2m \\equiv 13 \\pmod{21}$ \n\nTo solve for $m$, we need to find an inverse of $2 \\pmod{21}$. Since $2 \\cdot 11 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{21}$, the inverse of $2 \\pmod{21}$ is $11$. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 11:\n\n$m \\equiv 11 \\cdot 13 \\pmod{21}$ \n\n$m \\equiv 143 \\pmod{21}$ \n\nSince $143 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{21}$, we can rewrite this as:\n\n$m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{21}$ \n\nThis means $m = 21p + 1$ for some integer $p$.\n\nNow, substitute the expression for $m$ back into the equation $n = 23m + 22$:\n\n$n = 23(21p + 1) + 22$\n\n$n = 483p + 23 + 22$\n\n$n = 483p + 45$\n\nWe know that $n < 500$, so let's find the possible solutions for $p$:\n\nWe have $n = 483p + 45 < 500$ \n\nSubtracting 45 from both sides:\n\n$483p < 455$\n\nDividing both sides by 483:\n\n$p < \\frac{455}{483}$ \n\nSince $p$ must be an integer, the largest possible value of $p$ is $p = 0$.\n\nIf $p = 0$, then:\n\n$n = 483p + 45$\n\n$n = 483 \\cdot 0 + 45$\n\n$n = 45$\n\nHowever, this solution does not satisfy the second condition that when the freshmen are told to line up in columns of 21, 14 people are left in the last column.\n\nSubstituting $n = 45$ into the equation $n = 21k + 14$:\n\n$45 = 21k + 14$\n\nSubtracting 14 from both sides:\n\n$31 = 21k$\n\nSince 31 is not a multiple of 21, this solution is not valid.\n\nNow, let's try $p = 1$. \n\n$n = 483p + 45$\n\n$n = 483 \\cdot 1 + 45$\n\n$n = 528$\n\nSubstituting $n = 528$ into the equation $n = 21k + 14$:\n\n$528 = 21k + 14$\n\nSubtracting 14 from both sides:\n\n$514 = 21k$\n\nDividing both sides by 21:\n\n$k = 24 + \\frac{10}{21}$ \n\nSince $k$ must be an integer, this solution is also not valid.\n\nSince $p = 0$ and $p = 1$ do not work, let's test $p = 2$.\n\n$n = 483p + 45$\n\n$n = 483 \\cdot 2 + 45$\n\n$n = 951$\n\nSubstituting $n = 951$ into the equation $n = 21k + 14$:\n\n$951 = 21k + 14$\n\nSubtracting 14 from both sides:\n\n$937 = 21k$\n\nDividing both sides by 21:\n\n$k = 44 + \\frac{13}{21}$ \n\nSince $k$ must be an integer, this solution is also not valid.\n\nSince $p = 0$, $p = 1$, and $p = 2$ do not work, the only remaining option is $p = -1$. \n\n$n = 483p + 45$\n\n$n = 483(-1) + 45$\n\n$n = -483 + 45$\n\n$n = -438$\n\nSince $n$ cannot be negative, $p = -1$ is also not a valid solution.\n\nHowever, we can also try $p = -2$. \n\n$n = 483p + 45$\n\n$n = 483(-2) + 45$\n\n$n = -966 + 45$\n\n$n = -921$\n\nSince $n$ cannot be negative, $p = -2$ is also not a valid solution.\n\nSince we have exhausted all possibilities for $p$ and none of them work, we can try $p = -3$.\n\n$n = 483p + 45$\n\n$n = 483(-3) + 45$\n\n$n = -1449 + 45$\n\n$n = -1404$\n\nHowever, we still have one more option for $p$.
