    "solution": "We notice that in the units column, it's impossible for $\\triangle+2=1_6$. So, it must be the case that $\\triangle+2=11_6=7$. That would mean $\\triangle=7-2=\\boxed{5}$. We can check that our answer works by plugging our value for triangle into the original problem: $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & 3 & 2 & 1 & 5_6\\\\ & & & 5 & 4 & 0_6\\\\ &+ & & & 5 & 2_6\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & 4 & 2 & 5 & 1_6.\\\\ \\end{array} $$The addition problem still works, so our answer is correct.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this addition problem, let's consider the last column first. We have $\\triangle + 0 + 2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$. Since the sum of the two numbers must be a single digit, we can rewrite this as $\\triangle + 2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$. Then, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation, which gives us $\\triangle \\equiv -1 \\pmod 6$.\n\nHowever, this is a negative number, and we are working in base 6, so we can rewrite this as $\\triangle \\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$. This means that the possible value of $\\triangle$ is 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the second to last column. We have $\\triangle + 4 + \\triangle \\equiv \\triangle \\pmod 6$. Since we know that $\\triangle \\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$, we can substitute this into the equation: $5 + 4 + 5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$. Simplifying the left-hand side, we get $14 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$. This is true, because we can write 14 as $2\\times 6 + 2$, and $2\\times 6$ is divisible by 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the third to last column. We have $1 + \\triangle + \\triangle \\equiv \\triangle \\pmod 6$. Simplifying the left-hand side, we get $1 + 2\\triangle \\equiv \\triangle \\pmod 6$. Since we know that $\\triangle \\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$, we can substitute this into the equation: $1 + 2 \\times 5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$. Simplifying the left-hand side, we get $11 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$. This is true, because we can write 11 as $1\\times 6 + 5$, and $1\\times 6$ is divisible by 6.\n\nFinally, let's consider the first column. We have $3 + 0 + 0 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 6$. This is true, because we can write $4$ as $0\\times 6 + 4$, and $0\\times 6$ is divisible by 6.\n\nTherefore, the value of $\\triangle$ is $\\boxed{5}$."
