    "solution": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7. So the residue of the sum is  $$\n182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\equiv \\boxed{10} \\pmod{14}.\n$$",

    "model_solution": "To find the residue of the given expression modulo 14, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. First, we'll multiply 182 and 12:\n   $182 \\cdot 12 = 2184$\n\n2. Now, we'll find the residue of 2184 modulo 14:\n   To do this, we divide 2184 by 14 and find the remainder:\n   $2184 \\div 14 = 156$ with a remainder of $0$\n\n3. Next, we'll multiply 15 and 7:\n   $15 \\cdot 7 = 105$\n\n4. Now, we'll find the residue of 105 modulo 14:\n   To do this, we divide 105 by 14 and find the remainder:\n   $105 \\div 14 = 7$ with a remainder of $7$\n\n5. Finally, we'll add the residues we found and the number 3:\n   $0 - 7 + 3 = -4$\n\n6. Since we are working modulo 14, we need to find the residue of -4 modulo 14. To do this, we add 14 to -4 until we get a positive number less than 14:\n   $-4 + 14 = 10$\n\nSo, the residue of $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3$ modulo 14 is 10."
