    "problem": "What is the maximum possible value of the greatest common divisor of two consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n = n! + n$, where $n \\ge 0$?",
    "solution": "We start by taking the first step in the Euclidean algorithm: subtract the initial two terms. Notice that\n\\begin{align*}a_{n+1} - (n+1)a_n &= (n+1)! + n + 1 - (n+1)(n! + n) \\\\ &= (n+1)! + n + 1 - (n+1)! - n(n+1) \\\\ &= -n^2 + 1 = -(n-1)(n+1).\n\\end{align*}It follows that by the Euclidean Algorithm, \\begin{align*}\\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, a_{n+1}) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, a_{n+1} - (n+1)a_n)\\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, (n-1)(n+1)),\\end{align*}since the minus sign is irrelevant for calculating the gcd.\n\nWe know that $n-1$ divides $n!$, so that $n-1$ is relatively prime to $a_n = n! + n$:\n$$\\text{gcd}\\,(n-1,n!+n) = \\text{gcd}\\,(n-1,n) = 1.$$Thus, we can ignore the factor of $n-1$ completely, and say that\n$$\\text{gcd}\\,(a_n,a_{n+1}) = \\text{gcd}\\,(n! + n, n+1).$$Now, we have several cases, depending on whether $n+1$ is prime or composite. We also have a few edge cases to consider. The basic idea is that when $n+1$ is composite and greater than $4$, $n+1$ is a factor of $n!$, whereas when $n+1$ is prime, we can apply Wilson's Theorem.\n\n$\\textit{Case 0:}$ For $n = 0$, we find that $a_0 = 1, a_1 = 2$, with greatest common divisor $1$.\n\n$\\textit{Case composite:}$\n\n$\\qquad \\textit{Subcase 1:}$ If $n+1$ is composite and can be written as the product of two distinct integers greater than $1$ (say $n+1 = a \\times b$, $a > b > 1$), then $n+1$ divides\n$$n! = 1 \\times \\cdots \\times b \\times \\cdots \\times a \\times \\cdots \\times n.$$By the same argument as before, since $n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime, then $n! + n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime, yielding a greatest common divisor of $1$.\n\n$\\qquad \\textit{Subcase 2:}$ If $n+1 = p^2$ for some prime $p$, then $n! + n = (p^2 - 1)! + p^2-1$. If $2p < p^2 - 1$, then $p$ and $2p$ are both factors that appear in the expansion of $n!$, so $n+1$ divides $n!$ and the previous argument applies. For $p = 2$, we can quickly check that $3! + 3 = 9$ is relatively prime with $4$.\n\n$\\textit{Case prime:}$ If $n + 1 = p$ for some prime $p$, then $n! + n \\equiv (p-1)! + (p-1) \\equiv -2 \\pmod{p}$ by Wilson's Theorem. Thus, $n! + n$ is relatively prime with $n+1$ unless $n = 1$, for which we obtain $a_1 = 2, a_2 = 4$, with greatest common divisor 2.\n\nSo, the largest the greatest common divisor of two consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n$ can be is $\\boxed{2}$, which is achieved when we take $n=1$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the maximum possible value of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n = n! + n$, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the sequence**: The sequence is defined as $a_n = n! + n$, where $n \\ge 0$. This means that for each term in the sequence, we take the factorial of the term number (e.g., $n!$ for the $n^{th}$ term) and add the term number itself.\n\n2. **Find two consecutive terms**: To find the GCD of two consecutive terms, we need to look at two consecutive terms in the sequence. Let's call the $n^{th}$ term $a_n$ and the $(n+1)^{th}$ term $a_{n+1}$.\n\n3. **Express $a_{n+1}$ in terms of $a_n$**: We can express $a_{n+1}$ in terms of $a_n$ by substituting the definition of $a_n$ into the expression for $a_{n+1}$:\n   $a_{n+1} = (n+1)! + (n+1) = (n+1) \\cdot n! + (n+1)$\n   We can factor out $(n+1)$ from the first term:\n   $a_{n+1} = (n+1) \\cdot (n! + 1) + (n+1)$\n\n4. **Look for a relationship between $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$**: From the expression for $a_{n+1}$, we can see that the GCD of $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$ will be the same as the GCD of $a_n$ and $(n+1) \\cdot (n! + 1) + (n+1)$.\n\n5. **Determine the maximum possible value of the GCD**: Since $a_n = n! + n$ is already a large number, we don't want the GCD to be affected by the extra term $(n+1)$. Therefore, we can ignore the $(n+1)$ term and focus on finding the GCD of $a_n$ and $n! + 1$.\n\n6. **Consider the factor $n! + 1$**: The term $n! + 1$ is a special case because it is a sum of a factorial and $1$. We know that $n!$ is always even when $n \\ge 2$, so $n! + 1$ will always be odd.\n\n7. **Look for a pattern in the sequence**: When $n \\ge 2$, the first term of $a_n$ is always even and the second term of $a_{n+1}$ is always odd. This means that the GCD of two consecutive terms will always be $\\le 2$.\n\n8. **Consider the case when $n = 0$ or $n = 1$**: When $n = 0$, $a_0 = 0! + 0 = 1$ and $a_1 = 1! + 1 = 2$, so the GCD is $1$. When $n = 1$, $a_1 = 1! + 1 = 2$ and $a_2 = 2! + 2 = 4$, so the GCD is $2$.\n\n9. **Determine the maximum possible value of the GCD**: From the cases above, we can see that the maximum possible value of the GCD is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value of the greatest common divisor of two consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n = n! + n$ is $2$."
