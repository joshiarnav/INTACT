    "problem": "What is the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25?",
    "solution": "Every multiple of 25 ends in 00, 25, 50, or 75.  Since we want the product of the digits to be a positive multiple of 25, the final two digits must be either 25 or 75.\n\nA nonzero product of digits is a multiple of 25 exactly when two or more of the digits is are equal to 5. If a number ends in 75 and the product of its digits is a multiple of 25, then replacing 75 by 25 in that number will also give a smaller number whose product of digits is a multiple of 25.  Therefore we are looking for a number whose final two digits are 25 and for which 5 is one of the other digits.\n\nSince 525 is the smallest such number, the answer must be $\\boxed{525}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25, we should consider the properties of multiples of 25 and the conditions for the product of digits to be a multiple of 25.\n\n1. Multiples of 25 always end in 00, 25, 50, or 75.\n\n2. To be a multiple of 25, the number must have at least two factors of 5.\n\n3. For the product of digits to be a multiple of 25, the number must contain at least two factors of 5 in its digits.\n\nConsidering these points, the smallest number that meets the first condition is 25 itself. However, the product of its digits is 2 * 5 = 10, which is not a multiple of 25.\n\nThe next option is to add a 5 to 25, making it 125. The product of its digits is 1 * 2 * 5 = 10, which is still not a multiple of 25.\n\nTo make the product of digits a multiple of 25, we need at least two factors of 5 in the digits. The smallest number that meets this condition is 525.\n\nThe product of the digits of 525 is 5 * 2 * 5 = 50, which is a multiple of 25.\n\nTherefore, the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25 is 525."
