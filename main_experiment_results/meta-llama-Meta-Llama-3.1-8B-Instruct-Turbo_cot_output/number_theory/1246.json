    "problem": "A divisor of a number is a proper divisor if it is not equal to the number. What is the sum of the proper divisors of $432$?",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $432 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^3$. It follows that the sum of the divisors is equal to $(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4)(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3)$, as each factor of $432$ is represented when the product is expanded. We have to subtract $432$ so that we only count the proper divisors, so the answer is \\begin{align*}\n(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16)(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) - 432 &= (31)(40) - 432\\\\\n&= 1240 - 432\\\\\n&= \\boxed{808}.\\\\\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the proper divisors of 432, we can break it down into its prime factorization. \n\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of 432.\n\nWe know that 432 = 2 * 216. Then 216 = 2 * 108, 108 = 2 * 54, 54 = 2 * 27, and 27 = 3 * 9. 9 = 3 * 3, so 432 = 2^4 * 3^3.\n\nNow, the sum of the divisors of a number can be calculated if we know its prime factorization.\n\nLet's denote the prime factorization of a number as p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an. Then the sum of all the divisors of the number can be expressed as:\n(p1^0 + p1^1 + ... + p1^a1)(p2^0 + p2^1 + ... + p2^a2)...(pn^0 + pn^1 + ... + pn^an)\n\nIn our case, we have 432 = 2^4 * 3^3. So, the sum of all its divisors is:\n(2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4)(3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3)\n= (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16)(1 + 3 + 9 + 27)\n= 31 * 40\n= 1240\n\nHowever, this sum includes the number itself (432), and we need to find the sum of its proper divisors.\n\nTo find the sum of the proper divisors, we need to subtract the number itself from the sum of all divisors. So, the sum of the proper divisors of 432 is:\n1240 - 432 = 808\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of 432 is 808."
