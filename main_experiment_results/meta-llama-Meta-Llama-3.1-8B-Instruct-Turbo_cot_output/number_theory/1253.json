    "problem": "What is the largest number, with its digits all different, whose digits add up to 16?",
    "solution": "For a number to be as large as possible, we want as many places (digits) as possible. To allow for as many digits as possible, we want the digits to be small so that there will be more digits that add up to $16$. We start with the smallest number, $0$ and keep adding the next number. $0+1+2+3+4=10$. However, we cannot add $5$, because then we are left with $16-10-5=1$, and we already have the number $1$. Therefore, the next number to be added would be $16-10=6$.\nNow, we have the numbers $0,1,2,3,4,6$ to form a number. We want the larger places to have larger numbers. Therefore, we order the numbers in decreasing order to form the number $\\boxed{643210}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest number with its digits all different that add up to 16, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. We want the largest number, so we'll start with the largest digit, which is 9. We'll subtract 9 from 16 to see how much we have left to add up to 10 (the remaining digits).\n   16 - 9 = 7\n\n2. Now, we want to add two more digits that are as large as possible while keeping the total sum at 7. The next largest digits after 9 are 8 and 7. \n   8 + 7 = 15\n   Since we can't use 15, we should subtract 8 from 7, then add another number (which is 8), so that we can still have the highest value with the smallest sum. 8-7 + 1 = 2. Then, add 8 to get 10.\n   10 = 8 + 2 \n\n3. Now we have 8, 2, and we still need to add one more digit to make a 4-digit number. We should take the remaining number, which is 7 - 2 = 5, and subtract 5 from 2, then add another 5, so that we can still have the highest value with the smallest sum. We cannot do so. 10 = 8 + 2 = 5 + 5. Instead we can add the next largest number after 5, which is 4, to the 8, 2, and 5. 8 + 5 + 4 +2 = 19. We should remove 3,  to make a number whose digits add up to 16. 8 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 16. \n\n4. So, the largest number with its digits all different that add up to 16 is 8341."
