    "problem": "What is the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 which has two even and two odd digits?",
    "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Divisibility rule of 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. \n\n2. **Smallest four-digit number**: The smallest four-digit number is 1000.\n\n3. **Two even and two odd digits**: We need to choose digits such that two are even and two are odd. \n\n   - The smallest even digits are 0 and 2.\n   - The smallest odd digits are 1 and 3.\n\n4. **Try numbers starting with 1000**:\n\n   - We will try the smallest possible numbers by using the digits 0, 2, 1, and 3. We will first place the 0 in the thousands place, but since 0000 is not a four-digit number, we will place the 2 in the thousands place.\n\n   - 2000: Sum of digits = 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2 (not divisible by 9)\n\n   - Since 2000 is not divisible by 9, we will try the next possible smallest number, which is 2010. We place the 1 in the hundreds place, and the 0 in the tens and ones place.\n\n   - 2010: Sum of digits = 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3 (not divisible by 9)\n\n   - Next, we try the 2013, which places the 3 in the ones place.\n\n   - 2013: Sum of digits = 2 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 6 (not divisible by 9)\n\n   - Then, we try 2016, which places the 6 in the ones place.\n\n   - 2016: Sum of digits = 2 + 0 + 1 + 6 = 9 (divisible by 9)\n\n   - We have found our number: 2016.\n\nSo, the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits is **2016**."
