    "solution": "By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768 - 1729) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 39).\n\\end{align*}Since the sum of the digits of $1729$ is $19$, which is not divisible by $3$, it suffices to check whether or not $1729$ is divisible by $13$. We can find that it is by long division or noting that $12+1 = \\boxed{13}$ divides into $1729 = 12^3 + 1^3$ using the sum of cubes factorization.",

    "model_solution": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1729 and 1768, we'll use the Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm involves repeatedly applying the division algorithm.\n\n**Step 1:** Divide 1768 by 1729\n1768 \u00f7 1729 = 1 remainder 39\n\n**Step 2:** Now, divide 1729 by 39\n1729 \u00f7 39 = 44 remainder 13\n\n**Step 3:** Divide 39 by 13\n39 \u00f7 13 = 3 remainder 0\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, we can stop here. The divisor in this step, which is 13, is the greatest common divisor of 1729 and 1768.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of 1729 and 1768 is 13."
