    "problem": "What is the units digit of $13^{2003}$?",
    "solution": "Powers of 13 have the same units digit as the corresponding powers of 3; and $$\n3^1 = 3, \\quad 3^2 = 9, \\quad 3^3 = 27, \\quad 3^4 = 81, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 3^5 = 243.\n$$Since the units digit of $3^1$ is the same as the units digit of $3^5$, units digits of powers of 3 cycle through $3, 9, 7,$ and $1$. Hence the units digit of $3^{2000}$ is $1$, so the units digit of $3^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$. The same is true of the units digit of $13^{2003}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the units digit of $13^{2003}$, we can look for a pattern in the units digits of powers of 13.\n\nLet's start with some small powers of 13:\n- $13^1 = 13$, so the units digit is 3.\n- $13^2 = 169$, so the units digit is 9.\n- $13^3 = 2197$, so the units digit is 7.\n- $13^4 = 28561$, so the units digit is 1.\n\nWe can see that the units digit of powers of 13 follows a pattern: 3, 9, 7, 1, and then it repeats.\n\nSince we're dealing with $13^{2003}$, we need to find the remainder when 2003 is divided by 4 (the length of the pattern). \n\n2003 \u00f7 4 = 500 remainder 3.\n\nSince the remainder is 3, we look at the 3rd number in the pattern, which is 7.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is 7."
