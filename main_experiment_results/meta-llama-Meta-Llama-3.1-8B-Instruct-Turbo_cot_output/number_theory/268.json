    "solution": "Observing that $4 \\cdot 7 = 28 = 27 + 1,$ we multiply both sides of the given congruence by 7 to find $28x \\equiv 91 \\pmod{27}$. Since $28x\\equiv x\\pmod{27}$ and $91\\equiv10 \\pmod{27}$, we conclude that $x\\equiv 10\\pmod{27}$. Therefore, $\\boxed{10}$ is the smallest positive integer satisfying the given congruence.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the modular multiplicative inverse (MMI) of 4 mod 27**: The MMI of 4 mod 27 is an integer a such that $4a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}$. To find it, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\n\n2. **Apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: The algorithm states that for any two integers a and b, there exist integers x and y such that $ax + by = \\gcd(a, b)$. We can find the MMI using this algorithm.\n\n   - Start with the equation $27 = 4 \\times 6 + 3$.\n   - Then, $4 = 3 \\times 1 + 1$.\n\n   We see that the GCD of 4 and 27 is 1. To express 1 as a linear combination of 4 and 27, we can backtrack:\n\n   $1 = 4 - 3 \\times 1 = 4 - (27 - 4 \\times 6) \\times 1 = 4 \\times 7 - 27 \\times 1$.\n\n   Hence, the MMI of 4 mod 27 is 7.\n\n3. **Solve the congruence**: Multiply both sides of the given congruence by the MMI of 4 mod 27 (7):\n\n   $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27} \\Rightarrow 7 \\times 4x \\equiv 7 \\times 13 \\pmod{27} \\Rightarrow 28x \\equiv 91 \\pmod{27} \\Rightarrow x \\equiv 91 \\pmod{27}$.\n\n   Since $91 = 27 \\times 3 + 20$, the congruence can be rewritten as $x \\equiv 20 \\pmod{27}$.\n\n4. **Find the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence**: Since $x \\equiv 20 \\pmod{27}$, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence is 20.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$ is 20."
