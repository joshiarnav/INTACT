    "model_solution": "To find the remainder when the sum of $7145 + 7146 + 7147 + 7148 + 7149$ is divided by 8, we can first find the remainder of each individual number when divided by 8.\n\n1. $7145 \\mod 8$: Since $7144$ is divisible by 8 (it's 892 with 8*892=7088), we can subtract 8 from 7145. The result is $7145 - 8 = 7137$. 7137 is 893*8, so we can subtract 8 again, the result is $7137-8=7129$, $7129$ is 893*8-7, so we can subtract 8 again, the result is $7129-8=7121$, $7121$ is 892*8+1, so we can add 7, the result is $7121+7=7128$. Since $7128$ is divisible by 8 (it's 892 with 8*892=7088), we can subtract 8 from 7145. The result is $7145 - 8 = 7137$. Since 7137 is divisible by 8, $7145 \\mod 8$ is equal to 1.\n\n2. $7146 \\mod 8$: Since $7146$ is $7145 + 1$, we can add 1 to the remainder of $7145 \\mod 8$, which is 1. So $7146 \\mod 8$ is equal to 2.\n\n3. $7147 \\mod 8$: Since $7147$ is $7146 + 1$, we can add 1 to the remainder of $7146 \\mod 8$, which is 2. So $7147 \\mod 8$ is equal to 3.\n\n4. $7148 \\mod 8$: Since $7148$ is $7147 + 1$, we can add 1 to the remainder of $7147 \\mod 8$, which is 3. So $7148 \\mod 8$ is equal to 4.\n\n5. $7149 \\mod 8$: Since $7149$ is $7148 + 1$, we can add 1 to the remainder of $7148 \\mod 8$, which is 4. So $7149 \\mod 8$ is equal to 5.\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder of the sum of these numbers when divided by 8.\n\n$7145 \\mod 8$ + $7146 \\mod 8$ + $7147 \\mod 8$ + $7148 \\mod 8$ + $7149 \\mod 8$\n= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5\n= 15\n$15\\mod 8$ is equal to 7.\n\nThe remainder when the sum of $7145 + 7146 + 7147 + 7148 + 7149$ is divided by 8 is 7."
