    "problem": "When $555_{10}$ is expressed in this base, it has 4 digits, in the form ABAB, where A and B are two different digits.  What base is it?",
    "solution": "First, let us find which bases result in $555_{10}$ having four digits. We must find base b such that $b^{4}>555_{10}\\geq b^{3}$. We easily determine that b can range from 5 to 8, inclusive.  We can now try each of these four bases to see which yields a number in the form ABAB.  For base six, we find that $6^{3}=216$, which can go into 555 only two times at most, leaving $555-2\\cdot216 = 123$ for the next three digits. $6^{2}=36$ goes into 123 three times at most, leaving us with $123-3\\cdot36 = 15$. Then, $6^{1}=6$ goes into 15 two times at most, leaving $15-2\\cdot6 = 3$ for the ones digit. So, the base $\\boxed{6}$ equivalent of $555_{10}$ is $2323_{6}$, which satisfies all of the requirements stated.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break this down step by step.\n\nSince $555_{10}$ has 4 digits in the new base, we know that the new base must be such that $b^3 \\leq 555_{10} < b^4$, where $b$ is the base.\n\nWe can start by finding the cube root of 555, which is approximately 8.17. The fourth root of 555 is approximately 4.25.\n\nSo, we need to find a base $b$ that is greater than 4.25 and less than 8.17. This means that the base $b$ must be between 5 and 8 (inclusive).\n\nLet's try each of these bases:\n\n- For base 5, $555_{10} = 4200_{5}$ (4 digits, but not in the form ABAB).\n- For base 6, $555_{10} = 2323_{6}$ (4 digits and in the form ABAB).\n- For base 7, $555_{10} = 1453_{7}$ (4 digits, but not in the form ABAB).\n- For base 8, $555_{10} = 1033_{8}$ (4 digits, but not in the form ABAB).\n\nTherefore, the base that satisfies the given conditions is base 6.\n\nThe final answer is 6."
