    "problem": "How many even divisors does $7!$ have?",
    "solution": "By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, we may count the number of even divisors of $7!$ by counting the number of ways to form the prime factorization of an even divisor of $7!$.  Suppose that $7!$ is divisible by an even positive integer $r$.  Since the prime factorization of $7!$ is $7\\cdot(2\\cdot3)\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\cdot2)\\cdot3\\cdot2=2^4\\cdot3^2\\cdot5\\cdot7$, the prime factorization of $r$ does not include any primes other than $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$.  Express $r$ in terms of its prime factorization as $2^a3^b5^c7^d$.  Then $7!/r=2^{4-a}3^{2-b}5^{1-c}7^{1-d}$.  Since $7!/r$ is an integer, $d$ must equal $0$ or $1$, $c$ must equal $0$ or $1$, and $b$ must equal $0$, $1$ or $2$.  Finally, $a$ may be no larger than $4$, but it must be at least $1$ since $r$ is even.  Altogether there are $2\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=48$ total possibilities for the four exponents $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, and hence $\\boxed{48}$ even divisors.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total number of even divisors of $7!$, we'll break it down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Find the prime factorization of $7!$**\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of $7!$, which is the product of all positive integers up to 7.\n\n$7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$\n\n$7! = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1$\n\n**Step 2: Understand what makes an even divisor**\n\nFor a divisor to be even, it must have at least one factor of 2. Since $7!$ has a factor of $2^4$, any even divisor of $7!$ can have powers of 2 ranging from $2^1$ to $2^4$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of even divisors**\n\nNow, let's consider the other prime factors (3, 5, and 7) and how they can combine with the powers of 2 to form even divisors.\n\nFor each power of 2 ($2^1$, $2^2$, $2^3$, or $2^4$), the other prime factors (3, 5, and 7) can have various combinations. Let's count these combinations:\n\n- **Power of 3**: Since $3^2$ is the highest power of 3 in $7!$, each even divisor can have a power of 3 ranging from $3^0$ to $3^2$. That's 3 possibilities.\n- **Power of 5**: Since $5^1$ is the highest power of 5 in $7!$, each even divisor can have a power of 5 ranging from $5^0$ to $5^1$. That's 2 possibilities.\n- **Power of 7**: Since $7^1$ is the highest power of 7 in $7!$, each even divisor can have a power of 7 ranging from $7^0$ to $7^1$. That's 2 possibilities.\n\nTo find the total number of even divisors, we multiply the number of possibilities for each prime factor:\n\n3 (powers of 3) \u00d7 2 (powers of 5) \u00d7 2 (powers of 7) = 12\n\nHowever, we need to consider that we're only counting even divisors here, but we have counted $3^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1$ which is an odd divisor, so our count is off by one, because we included one odd number. To correct this we need to subtract 1.\n\nThe correct count is $12 - 1 = 11$\n\nTherefore, the number of even divisors of $7!$ is 11."
