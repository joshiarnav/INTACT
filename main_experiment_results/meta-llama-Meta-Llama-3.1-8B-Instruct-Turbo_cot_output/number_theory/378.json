    "model_solution": "To find the sum of all positive integer values of n such that $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the expression**: The expression $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ can be rewritten as $\\frac{n}{n} + \\frac{18}{n}$. This simplifies to $1 + \\frac{18}{n}$.\n\n2. **Condition for the expression to be an integer**: For the expression $1 + \\frac{18}{n}$ to be an integer, $\\frac{18}{n}$ must be an integer. This means n must be a factor of 18.\n\n3. **Finding the factors of 18**: The positive factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\n4. **Calculating the sum of the factors**: The sum of the factors of 18 is $1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 18 = 39$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integer values of n such that $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer is 39."
