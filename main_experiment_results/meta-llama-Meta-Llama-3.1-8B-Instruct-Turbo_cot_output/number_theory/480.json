    "problem": "Let $g(n)$ be the product of the proper positive integer divisors of $n$. (Recall that a proper divisor of $n$ is a divisor other than $n$.) For how many values of $n$ does $n$ not divide $g(n)$, given that $2 \\le n \\le 50$?",
    "solution": "If $n$ is prime, then $g(n) = 1$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. The primes less than or equal to $50$ are $$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.$$There are $15$ of these primes. Also, if $n$ is the square of a prime, then $g(n) = \\sqrt{n}$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. By looking at the list of primes we already generated, we see that there are four perfect squares of primes less than $50$. If $n$ is any other composite integer, then it can be decomposed into the product of integers $a$ and $b$ with both integers greater than $1$. We have that $ab$ divides $g(n)$ (since $g(n)$ is the product of a collection of integers including $a$ and $b$). Since $ab=n$, this implies that $n$ divides $g(n)$. As a result, there are $15 + 4 = \\boxed{19}$ values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the values of n for which n does not divide g(n), we'll analyze the possible cases of n and their corresponding g(n).\n\n1. **Prime numbers**: If n is a prime number, then g(n) = 1 because the only proper divisors of a prime number are 1, and the product of 1 is 1. Therefore, n does not divide g(n) for all prime numbers.\n\n   - Prime numbers between 2 and 50: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47. There are 15 prime numbers.\n\n2. **Perfect squares of prime numbers**: If n is a perfect square of a prime number, then g(n) = 1 because the only proper divisors of a perfect square of a prime number are 1, and the product of 1 is 1. Therefore, n does not divide g(n) for all perfect squares of prime numbers.\n\n   - Perfect squares of prime numbers between 2 and 50: 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2), 25 (5^2), 49 (7^2). There are 4 perfect squares of prime numbers.\n\n3. **Products of two distinct primes**: If n is the product of two distinct primes, then g(n) is also the product of the two primes. Therefore, n divides g(n) for all products of two distinct primes.\n\n   - Products of two distinct primes between 2 and 50: 6 (2 * 3), 10 (2 * 5), 14 (2 * 7), 15 (3 * 5), 21 (3 * 7), 22 (2 * 11), 26 (2 * 13), 33 (3 * 11), 34 (2 * 17), 35 (5 * 7), 38 (2 * 19), 39 (3 * 13), 42 (2 * 3 * 7, but this is not the product of two distinct primes, so we ignore it for now, we will treat it as a special case), 46 (2 * 23), 51 (3 * 17, but this is greater than 50, so we ignore it). However, we must combine this with the special case.  There are 14 products of two distinct primes.\n\n4. **Cubes of prime numbers**: If n is a cube of a prime number, then g(n) is the square of the prime. Therefore, n divides g(n) for all cubes of prime numbers.\n\n   - Cubes of prime numbers between 2 and 50: 8 (2^3), 27 (3^3). There are 2 cubes of prime numbers.\n\n5. **Special case: n = 2 * 3 * 7 = 42**: In this case, g(n) = 1 * 2 * 3 * 7 = 42. However, n divides g(n) in this case.\n\n6. **Special case: n = 2 * 3 * 5 = 30**: In this case, g(n) = 1 * 2 * 3 * 5 = 30. However, n divides g(n) in this case.\n\n7. **Other composite numbers**: If n is any other composite number, it can be expressed as a product of at least three distinct primes, and g(n) will also be a product of at least three distinct primes. Therefore, n divides g(n) for all other composite numbers.\n\nCombining all these cases, we find that n does not divide g(n) for the 15 prime numbers and the 4 perfect squares of prime numbers. Therefore, the total number of values of n for which n does not divide g(n) is 15 + 4 = 19."
