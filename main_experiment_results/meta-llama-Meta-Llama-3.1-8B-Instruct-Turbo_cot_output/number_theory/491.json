    "problem": "Marcus has two numbers, $a$ and $b$.  When he divides $a$ by 45 he gets a remainder of 37.  When he divides $b$ by 30 he gets a remainder of $9$.  What remainder does he get when he divides $a+b$ by 15?",
    "solution": "Marcus has two equations: \\[a=45n+37\\]and \\[b=30m+9.\\]When he adds these he gets \\[a+b=45n+30m+37+9=15(3n+2m)+46=15(3n+2m+3)+1.\\]The remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15 is $\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break it down step by step.\n\nGiven that when Marcus divides $a$ by 45, he gets a remainder of 37. This can be represented as:\n\n$a = 45k + 37$\n\nwhere $k$ is some integer.\n\nSimilarly, when he divides $b$ by 30, he gets a remainder of 9. This can be represented as:\n\n$b = 30m + 9$\n\nwhere $m$ is some integer.\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15. \n\nTo do this, let's first add the two expressions for $a$ and $b$:\n\n$a + b = (45k + 37) + (30m + 9)$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$a + b = 45k + 30m + 46$\n\nNow, we want to rewrite this expression in terms of multiples of 15. \n\nWe can substitute 45 as 3*15 and 30 as 2*15:\n\n$a + b = (3*15)k + (2*15)m + 46$\n\nWe can now factor out 15 from the first two terms:\n\n$a + b = 15(3k + 2m) + 46$\n\nSince we can't factor 15 out from 46, we need to deal with the remainder. \n\nThe remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15 will be the remainder when 46 is divided by 15. \n\nWe can rewrite 46 as 15*3 + 1.\n\nSo the remainder is 1.\n\nTherefore, when Marcus divides $a+b$ by 15, he gets a remainder of 1."
