    "problem": "What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}?$",
    "solution": "First, we simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$ to $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, we have $$17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$This means that $17n$ can be written in the form $7a+2$, where $a$ is an integer. So we have $17n=7a+2$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\\frac{7a+2}{17}=n$ is an integer. By trying values for $a$, we find that the smallest integer $a$ which satisfies the equation is $7$. Therefore, the least value for $n$ is $\\frac{51}{17}=\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve the congruence $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we need to simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$:\n   We find $1234 \\pmod{7}$ by dividing $1234$ by $7$ and taking the remainder.\n   $1234 \\div 7 = 176$ with a remainder of $2$.\n   So, $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n2. Now we have the congruence $17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n   The next step is to simplify $17 \\pmod{7}$.\n   $17 \\div 7 = 2$ with a remainder of $3$.\n   So, $17 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n3. The congruence now becomes $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n   To solve this, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of $3 \\pmod{7}$, which is an integer $x$ such that $3x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n   We can find this by trial and error or by using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\n   By trial and error, we find that $3 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n   So, the multiplicative inverse of $3 \\pmod{7}$ is $5$.\n\n4. Now that we have the multiplicative inverse of $3 \\pmod{7}$, we can multiply both sides of the congruence $3n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$ by $5$ to get $n \\equiv 5 \\cdot 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n   This simplifies to $n \\equiv 10 \\pmod{7}$.\n\n5. Finally, we simplify $10 \\pmod{7}$.\n   $10 \\div 7 = 1$ with a remainder of $3$.\n   So, $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$ is $\\boxed{3}$.\n\nTo make sure this is the answer, we can multiply $17$ by $3$ and check that the result is equivalent to $1234 \\pmod{7}$.\n$17 \\cdot 3 = 51$, and $51 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, which confirms our answer."
