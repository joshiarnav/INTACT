    "problem": "When Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 5, she has 3 remaining, and when she divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 remaining. If Claire has fewer than 60 cupcakes, what is the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that she could have?",
    "solution": "If Claire has $N$ cupcakes, we know that $N = 5x+3$ and $N = 7y+4$ for some integers $x$ and $y$. Equating these two forms of $N$, we have $7y+1=5x$. We also know that $N<60$. We can write out all the sufficiently small possible values of $7y+1$: $$1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57.$$Of these, the numbers that are also of the form $5x$ are $15$ and $50$. These correspond to solutions $N=18,$ $N=53$. Thus, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes is $53+18 = \\boxed{71}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. When Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 5, she has 3 remaining. This means the total number of cupcakes, n, can be represented as n = 5x + 3, where x is an integer.\n\n2. When Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 remaining. This means the total number of cupcakes, n, can also be represented as n = 7y + 4, where y is an integer.\n\n3. Since both expressions represent the total number of cupcakes, we can set them equal to each other: 5x + 3 = 7y + 4.\n\n4. Simplifying the equation, we get: 5x = 7y + 1.\n\n5. Now we need to find integer solutions for x and y. This is a linear Diophantine equation.\n\n6. To solve it, we can start by finding a particular solution. This can be done by trial and error or by using the Euclidean algorithm. \n\n7. After calculation, one particular solution is x = 4 and y = 3. Substituting this back into the equation 5x = 7y + 1, we find that it indeed holds true.\n\n8. Now we need to find the general solution for x and y. This can be done by using the formula for the general solution of a linear Diophantine equation:\n\n   x = x0 + 7t\n   y = y0 + 5t\n   where x0 = 4, y0 = 3, and t is an integer.\n\n9. Now we need to find all the values of x and y that satisfy the original equations and also give a total number of cupcakes less than 60.\n\n10. Plugging in values of t, we get the following possible values of x and y:\n    - For t = 0, x = 4 and y = 3.\n    - For t = 1, x = 11 and y = 8.\n    - For t = 2, x = 18 and y = 13.\n\n11. The corresponding possible quantities of cupcakes are:\n    - For t = 0, n = 5(4) + 3 = 23\n    - For t = 1, n = 5(11) + 3 = 58\n    - For t = 2, n = 5(18) + 3 = 93, which is greater than 60, so we exclude it.\n\n12. The sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes is 23 + 58 = 81.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that Claire could have is 81."
