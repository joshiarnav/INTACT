    "solution": "The units digit of any positive integer power of 5 is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\n(Note: this claim may be proved by induction, since the units digit of $5n$ is 5 whenever the units digit of $n$ is 5.)",

    "model_solution": "To find the units digit of $5^4$, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. We know that any power of 5 will end in 5 (5, 25, 125, 625, etc.). Since the pattern repeats every power, we can focus on finding the pattern.\n\n2. Since we know that $5^1 = 5$, $5^2 = 25$, $5^3 = 125$, we can assume that $5^4$ will end in 5 as well.\n\n3. To check, we can multiply 5 by itself 4 times: \n   $5 \\times 5 = 25$\n   $25 \\times 5 = 125$\n   $125 \\times 5 = 625$\n\n   So, $5^4$ equals 625. \n\n4. The units digit of 625 is 5.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $5^4$ is 5."
