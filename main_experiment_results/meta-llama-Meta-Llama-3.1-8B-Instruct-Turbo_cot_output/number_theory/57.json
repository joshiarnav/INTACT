    "problem": "When three positive integers are divided by $24$, the remainders are $10,$ $4,$ and $12,$ respectively.\n\nWhen the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, what is the remainder?",
    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 10\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 12\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 10+4+12 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $24$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24, we should start by understanding what each remainder means.\n\nWhen an integer is divided by 24 and the remainder is 10, it can be represented as $24a + 10$, where $a$ is an integer. This is because when you divide a number by 24, the remainder is the amount left over after you've divided as many times as you can by 24.\n\nSimilarly, when an integer is divided by 24 and the remainder is 4, it can be represented as $24b + 4$, where $b$ is an integer.\n\nLastly, when an integer is divided by 24 and the remainder is 12, it can be represented as $24c + 12$, where $c$ is an integer.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the three integers. \n\nSum = $(24a + 10) + (24b + 4) + (24c + 12)$\n\nCombine like terms.\n\nSum = $24a + 24b + 24c + 10 + 4 + 12$\n\nFactor out the 24.\n\nSum = $24(a + b + c) + 26$\n\nNow, let's rewrite 26 as $24 + 2$. \n\nSum = $24(a + b + c) + 24 + 2$\n\nNow, factor out 24.\n\nSum = $24(a + b + c + 1) + 2$\n\nIn this final expression, we can see that $24(a + b + c + 1)$ will be divisible by 24 and the remainder will be the amount left over, which is 2.\n\nTherefore, when the sum of the three integers is divided by 24, the remainder is 2."
