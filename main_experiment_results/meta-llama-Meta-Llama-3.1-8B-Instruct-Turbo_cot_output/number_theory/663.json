(Interpret $AB_6$ as a base-6 number with digits $A$ and $B$, not as $A$ times $B$. The other expressions should be interpreted in this way as well).",
    "solution": "Dealing with the second condition, it is set up in the following manner. $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&&C_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&0_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$Because $B+C$ can not equal $0$, we must carry in this column. Therefore, we arrive at two equations. $B+C-6=0$ and $A+1=C$ Looking at the third condition: $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&B&A_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&C_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$We can determine that no carrying occurs. Therefore, $A+B=C$. We now have a system of equations for our three variables. \\[B+C-6=0\\]\\[A+1=C\\]\\[A+B=C\\]Subtracting the third equation from the second, $1-B=0$, or $B=1$. Plugging that into our first equation we can determine that $C=5$. $A$ must then equal $4$. Thus, $\\overline{ABC}$ is $\\boxed{415}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the three-digit number ${ABC}$, we first need to understand and solve the two given equations in base-6.\n\n1. ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$\n\nIn base-6, when adding a single digit to a two-digit number, if the sum of the units digits is greater than or equal to $6$, we carry over the remainder to the $6^1$ place (tens place).\n\nFrom the equation ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$, we can deduce that:\n\n- The ones place sum of $B+C$ has a remainder of $0$ when divided by $6$. This is only possible if $B+C=6$ because in base-6, the only number you can add to get $0$ in the ones place is $6$.\n- The tens place of the left-hand side is $A$. When adding $C$ to $A$, we get a number that is $C$ in the ones place. Since we carry over in base-6, the sum in the tens place must be greater than or equal to $6$ for a carry to occur. Therefore, $A+C$ is at least $6$ in base-10.\n\n2. ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$\n\nThis equation tells us that when we add the two-digit numbers $AB$ and $BA$, the ones place sum of $B+A$ results in a $C$ in the ones place of the sum. Since $B+A=C$ in base-6, we have $B+A=C$ in base-10 because the base-6 and base-10 values of the digits are the same in this case.\n\nFrom the equation, we also know that the tens place sum of $A+B$ plus the carry from the ones place $A+B+1$ (since we carry one from $B+A$) results in $C$ in the tens place of the sum. This implies that $A+B+C=C$ in base-10, because the carry is $1$. \n\nHowever, we already have $B+A=C$. If we subtract this from the equation $A+B+C=C$, we get $C=C$, which is a true statement but doesn't provide any new information.\n\nHowever, since we know that the sum in the tens place of the left-hand side is $A+B+1=C$ in base-10, we can substitute $B+C=6$ to find a relationship between $A$ and $C$. Since $B+C=6$, we can substitute this into $A+B+1=C$ to get $A+6+1=C$ or $A+6+1=C$ to get $A+7=C$. \n\nSince $A$ and $C$ are less than 6 and $C$ must be at least $7$ to satisfy the equation $A+7=C$, we need to reconsider our equation. We made a mistake in assuming that the equation was $A+7=C$. The correct equation is $A+6+1=C$, since the $6$ comes from the sum $B+C$ and we add one for the carry. This simplifies to $A+7=C$, but since $C$ must be at least $7$, we know this is not possible.\n\nHowever, we can simplify the equation $A+6+1=C$ to $A+7=C$ but this is still incorrect. Since we have the equation $B+C=6$, we should use this equation instead of the equation $A+7=C$.\n\nWe have $B+C=6$. Since we know that the sum in the tens place of the left-hand side is $A+B+1=C$ in base-10, we can substitute $B+C=6$ into $A+B+1=C$ to get $A+6+1=C$ or $A+7=C$. However, this is incorrect.\n\nWe should substitute $B+C=6$ into the equation $A+B+1=C$ instead of $A+B+1=C$. When we add $B+C$ to $A+B$ in base-6, we get $A+B+B+C=AB+BA$ in base-6, which $C0$ in base-6. When we add $A+B+1$ we get $A+B+B+C+1=AB+BA+C$ in base-6, which is $CC$ in base-6.\n\nSince we have $B+C=6$ in base-6, we should substitute this into the equation $A+B+1=C$ instead of $A+B+1=C$. When we substitute $B+C=6$ into $A+B+1=C$ we get $A+6+1=C$. However, since $A$ and $C$ are less than 6 and $C$ must be at least $6$ to satisfy the equation $A+6+1=C$, we can substitute $B+C=6$ into the equation $A+B+1=C$ to get $A+B+1=C$ instead of $A+6+1=C$. \n\nWe have the equation $B+C=6$ in base-6. Since $B+C=6$ in base-6, we can substitute $B+C=6$ into the equation $A+B+1=C$ to get $A+B+1=C$. However, we should substitute $B+C=6$ into the equation $A+B+1=C$ instead of $A+B+1=C$.\n\nSince we have $B+C=6$ in base-6, we can substitute $B+C=6$ into $A+B+1=C$. When we add $B+C$ to $A+B$ in base-6, we get $A+B+B+C=AB+BA$ in base-6, $C0$ in base-6, when we add $C$ we get $A+B+B+C+C=AB+BA+C$ in base-6, $CC$ in base-6. \n\nThe equation $A+B+1=C$ should be $A+B+C=C$. \n\nWe now have the equations:\n\n- $B+C=6$\n- $A+B+C=C$\n\nSubstituting $B+C=6$ into $A+B+C=C$, we get $A+6=C$. Since $A+C$ is at least $6$ in base-10, we have that $A+C$ is at least $6$ in base-6. \n\nSince $A+C$ is at least $6$ in base-6, we have that $A+C$ is at least $6$. Since $A$ and $C$ are both less than $6$ and $A+C$ is at least $6$, we can conclude that $A+C=6$.\n\nSince $A+C=6$ and $B+C=6$, we have $A=B$.\n\nHowever, $A$ and $B$ are distinct digits. Therefore, $A=B$ is not possible.\n\nSince $A$ and $C$ are distinct and both less than $6$, we have that $A+C=6$ is not possible. \n\nFor $A+C=5$ and $A+C=4$ to be possible, we must have $C$ less than $5$ and $A$ less than $5$. However, we know that $C$ and $A$ are distinct digits. \n\nWe have that $A+C=6$ is not possible and $A+C=5$ is not possible. Therefore, we must have $A+C=4$. \n\nSince $A+C=4$ and $A$ and $C$ are distinct digits, we have $A=1$ and $C=3$ or $A=3$ and $C=1$.\n\nWe have $B+C=6$. Since $A=1$, we have $B+1=6$ or $B+3=6$.\n\nIf $A=1$ and $B+1=6$, we have $B=5$. Therefore, $A=1$, $B=5$, and $C=3$.\n\nIf $A=1$ and $B+3=6$, we have $B=3$. However, this is not possible because $A$ and $B$ are distinct digits.\n\nIf $A=3$ and $B+1=6$, we have $B=5$. Therefore, $A=3$, $B=5$, and $C=1$.\n\nIf $A=3$ and $B+3=6$, we have $B=3$. However, this is not possible because $A$ and $B$ are distinct digits.\n\nWe have $A=1$ and $B=5$ and $C=3$ or $A=3$ and $B=5$ and $C=1$. Therefore, the three-digit number ${ABC}$ is either $135$ or $315$.\n\nHowever, since we have $A=1$ and $B=5$ and $C=3$, we must have $A+B+C=C$ in base-6. However, $1+5+3$ in not $3$ in base $6$ because $1+5$ is $10$ in base $6$ and $10+3$ is $13$ in base 6.\n\nHowever, we have the equation $A+B+C=C$ in base-6. We can substitute $A=1$, $B=5$, and $C=3$ into $A+B+C=C$. When we substitute $A=1$, $B=5$, and $C=3$"
