    "problem": "The number $r$ can be expressed as a four-place decimal $0.abcd,$ where $a, b, c,$ and $d$ represent digits, any of which could be zero. It is desired to approximate $r$ by a fraction whose numerator is 1 or 2 and whose denominator is an integer. The closest such fraction to $r$ is $\\frac 27.$ What is the number of possible values for $r$?\n",
    "solution": "The nearest fractions to $\\frac 27$ with numerator $1$ are $\\frac 13, \\frac 14$; and with numerator $2$ are $\\frac 26, \\frac 28 = \\frac 13, \\frac 14$ anyway. For $\\frac 27$ to be the best approximation for $r$, the decimal must be closer to $\\frac 27 \\approx .28571$ than to $\\frac 13 \\approx .33333$ or $\\frac 14 \\approx .25$.\nThus $r$ can range between $\\frac{\\frac 14 + \\frac{2}{7}}{2} \\approx .267857$ and $\\frac{\\frac 13 + \\frac{2}{7}}{2} \\approx .309523$. At $r = .2679, .3095$, it becomes closer to the other fractions, so $.2679 \\le r \\le .3095$ and the number of values of $r$ is $3095 - 2679 + 1 = \\boxed{417}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the values of $r$ that are closest to $\\frac{2}{7} = 0.\\overline{285714}$.\n\nSince $r$ is a four-place decimal $0.abcd$, let's consider a number $r' = 0.abcd$ that lies between $0.0abcd$ and $0.1abcd$, i.e., $10^{-4} < r' < 10^{-3}$.\n\nWe want to find the values of $r'$ that are closest to $\\frac{2}{7}$. To do this, let's first find the values of $\\frac{2}{7}$ to the nearest four decimal places, which is $0.2857$.\n\nNow, let's assume that $r'$ is between $0.2855$ and $0.2858$, because these intervals are the closest to $0.2857$.\n\nWe know that the closest fraction to $r'$ is $\\frac{2}{7}$. Since the numerator is either 1 or 2 and the denominator is an integer, the closest fractions to $\\frac{2}{7}$ with these constraints are $\\frac{2}{7}$ itself and $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nHowever, $\\frac{1}{3}$ is farther away from $0.2857$ than $\\frac{2}{7}$, so we don't need to consider $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nNow, we need to consider when the closest fraction to $r'$ is $\\frac{2}{7}$. The midpoint of the interval $[0.2855, 0.2858]$ is $0.28565$, which is a little closer to $\\frac{2}{7}$ than $\\frac{2}{7}$ itself.\n\nThis means that any $r'$ in $[0.2854, 0.2856]$ will have $\\frac{2}{7}$ as the closest fraction.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the intervals $[0.2856, 0.2857)$ and $[0.2857, 0.2858]$. In the first interval, $\\frac{1}{3}$ is closer to the lower bound than $\\frac{2}{7}$, and in the second interval, $\\frac{1}{3}$ is closer to the upper bound than $\\frac{2}{7}$.\n\nThis means that in the intervals $[0.2856, 0.2857)$ and $[0.2857, 0.2858]$, the closest fraction to $r'$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$. \n\nHowever, we already determined that in the interval $[0.2854, 0.2856]$, the closest fraction to $r'$ is $\\frac{2}{7}$. \n\nThis means that any $r'$ in $[0.2854, 0.2856]$ will have $\\frac{2}{7}$ as the closest fraction, any $r'$ in $[0.2856, 0.2857)$ will have $\\frac{1}{3}$ as the closest fraction, any $r'$ in $[0.2857, 0.2858]$ will have $\\frac{2}{7}$ as the closest fraction, and any $r'$ in $[0.2858, 0.2859]$ will have $\\frac{1}{3}$ as the closest fraction.\n\nSince the length of the interval $[0.2854, 0.2856]$ is $0.0002$, the number of possible values of $r'$ in this interval is $\\boxed{21}$.\n\nSince the length of the interval $[0.2856, 0.2857)$ is $0.0001$, the number of possible values of $r'$ in this interval is $10$.\n\nSince the length of the interval $[0.2857, 0.2858]$ is $0.0001$, the number of possible values of $r'$ in this interval is $\\boxed{10}$.\n\nSince the length of the interval $[0.2858, 0.2859]$ is $0.0001$, the number of possible values of $r'$ in this interval is $\\boxed{10}$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible values of $r$ is $21 + 10 + 10 + 10 = \\boxed{51}.$"
