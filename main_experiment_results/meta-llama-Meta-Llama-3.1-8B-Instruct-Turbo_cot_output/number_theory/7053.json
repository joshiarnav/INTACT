    "problem": "A solid rectangular block is formed by gluing together $N$ congruent 1-cm cubes face to face. When the block is viewed so that three of its faces are visible, exactly $231$ of the 1-cm cubes cannot be seen. Find the smallest possible value of $N.$\n",
    "solution": "The $231$ cubes which are not visible must lie below exactly one layer of cubes. Thus, they form a rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension. If the original block has dimensions $l \\times m \\times n$, we must have $(l - 1)\\times(m-1) \\times(n - 1) = 231$. The prime factorization of $231 = 3\\cdot7\\cdot11$, so we have a variety of possibilities; for instance, $l - 1 = 1$ and $m - 1 = 11$ and $n - 1 = 3 \\cdot 7$, among others. However, it should be fairly clear that the way to minimize $l\\cdot m\\cdot n$ is to make $l$ and $m$ and $n$ as close together as possible, which occurs when the smaller block is $3 \\times 7 \\times 11$. Then the extra layer makes the entire block $4\\times8\\times12$, and $N= \\boxed{384}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest possible value of N, we need to understand how the solid rectangular block is formed and how the 231 invisible cubes are distributed within it.\n\nLet's denote the dimensions of the rectangular block as length (l), width (w), and height (h), where all dimensions are in centimeters. Since each cube has a volume of 1 cm^3, the total number of cubes, N, is equal to the product of the dimensions: N = l * w * h.\n\nThe 231 invisible cubes are located inside the block and cannot be seen when it is viewed from one side. This means they are not on the surface of the block.\n\nTo minimize N, we want to minimize the product l * w * h. Since there are 231 invisible cubes, we can think of them as being contained in a smaller cube with dimensions (l-1), (w-1), and (h-1). The volume of this smaller cube is (l-1) * (w-1) * (h-1) = 231.\n\nNow, we need to find the prime factorization of 231, which is 3 * 7 * 11. We want to find the smallest possible dimensions of the smaller cube that have these prime factors.\n\nAfter checking, we find that the smallest possible dimensions of the smaller cube that satisfy this condition are (l-1) = 3, (w-1) = 7, and (h-1) = 11.\n\nNow, we can find the dimensions of the original block by adding 1 to each of these dimensions:\n\nl = 3 + 1 = 4\nw = 7 + 1 = 8\nh = 11 + 1 = 12\n\nNow that we have the dimensions of the rectangular block, we can find the smallest possible value of N:\n\nN = l * w * h = 4 * 8 * 12 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of N is 384."
