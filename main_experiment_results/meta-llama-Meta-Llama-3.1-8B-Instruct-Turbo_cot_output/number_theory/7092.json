    "problem": "Find the least odd prime factor of $2019^8+1$.\n",
    "solution": "We know that $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ for some prime $p$. We want to find the smallest odd possible value of $p$. By squaring both sides of the congruence, we find $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is a positive divisor of $16$.\nHowever, if the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $1, 2, 4,$ or $8,$ then $2019^8$ will be equivalent to $1 \\pmod{p},$ which contradicts the given requirement that $2019^8\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$.\nTherefore, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $16$. Because all orders modulo $p$ divide $\\phi(p)$, we see that $\\phi(p)$ is a multiple of $16$. As $p$ is prime, $\\phi(p) = p\\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{p}\\right) = p - 1$. Therefore, $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$. The two smallest primes equivalent to $1 \\pmod{16}$ are $17$ and $97$. As $2019^8 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$ and $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{97}$, the smallest possible $p$ is thus $\\boxed{97}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least odd prime factor of $2019^8+1$, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic.\n\nStep 1: Observe that $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ for some prime $p$. \n\nStep 2: Since $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$, we can square both sides to get $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nStep 3: Now, we need to find the smallest prime $p$ that satisfies this congruence.\n\nStep 4:  We can use Fermat's Little Theorem (FLT), which states that if $p$ is a prime and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. \n\nStep 5: However, since  $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, then $a^{2(p-1)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nStep 6:  Now we have $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, so  $16$ should be a divisor of $p-1$.\n\nStep 7:  Since 16 has four positive divisors (1, 2, 4, and 16), we get four possible values for $p-1$ (16, 2, 4, 1)  which gives us  17, 3, 5, 2.\n\nStep 8:  However, we know that 2 is not a prime number.\n\nStep 9:  The smallest odd prime value for  $p-1$ is 3 which corresponds to $p=5$ and the next one is 5 which is $p=11$.\n\nStep 10:  To verify, we can use  $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{5}$ and $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{11}$, since $2019 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$ and $2019 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}$."
