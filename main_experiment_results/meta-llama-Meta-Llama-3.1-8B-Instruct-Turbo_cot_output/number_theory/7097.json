    "solution": "Taking inspiration from $4^4 \\mid 10^{10}$ we are inspired to take $n$ to be $p^2$, the lowest prime not dividing $210$, or $11 \\implies n = 121$. Now, there are $242$ factors of $11$, so $11^{242} \\mid m^m$, and then $m = 11k$ for $k \\geq 22$. Now, $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = \\gcd(11+k,210) = 1$. Noting $k = 26$ is the minimal that satisfies this, we get $(n,m) = (121,286)$. Thus, it is easy to verify this is minimal and we get $\\boxed{407}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least possible value of $m+n$, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and use some mathematical techniques to minimize their sum.\n\nFrom the conditions, we have:\n\n1. $\\gcd(m+n, 210)=1$\nThis means that $m+n$ is not divisible by any of the prime factors of 210, which are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n2. $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$\nThis implies that $m^m \\ge n^n$, and since $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, we can take the $m$-th root of both sides to get $m \\ge n$.\n\n3. $m$ is not a multiple of $n$\nThis condition is already satisfied by the previous condition, so we can focus on finding the smallest values of $m$ and $n$ that satisfy the other two conditions.\n\nNow, let's find the smallest values of $m$ and $n$ that satisfy the conditions:\n\nSince $m \\ge n$, we can write $m = kn$ for some positive integer $k \\ge 1$. Then, we have:\n\n$$m^m = (kn)^m = k^m n^m$$\n\nSince $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$, we can write:\n\n$$k^m n^m \\ge n^n$$\n\nDividing both sides by $n^n$, we get:\n\n$$k^m \\ge n^{nm}$$\n\nSince $k \\ge 1$, we can take the $m$-th root of both sides to get:\n\n$$k \\ge n^{\\frac{m}{m}-1}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$k \\ge n^{\\frac{1}{n}-1}$$\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest values of $m$ and $n$ that satisfy the conditions. We can start by trying small values of $n$ and see if we can find a corresponding value of $m$ that satisfies the conditions.\n\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, we can try $n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. However, if $n = 1$, then $m = 1$, which implies that $m+n = 2$, but this is not the least possible value of $m+n$ because $m+n$ must be relatively prime to 210.\n\nIf $n = 2$, then $k \\ge 2^{\\frac{1}{2}-1} = 2^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$, but this is not an integer.\n\nIf $n = 3$, then $k \\ge 3^{\\frac{1}{3}-1} = 3^{-\\frac{2}{3}}$, but this is not an integer.\n\nIf $n = 4$, then $k \\ge 4^{\\frac{1}{4}-1} = 4^{-\\frac{3}{4}}$, but this is not an integer.\n\nHowever, if $n = 5$, then $k \\ge 5^{\\frac{1}{5}-1} = 5^{-\\frac{4}{5}}$, but this is not an integer.\n\nIf $n = 6$, then $k \\ge 6^{\\frac{1}{6}-1} = 6^{-\\frac{5}{6}}$, but this is not an integer.\n\nIf $n = 7$, then $k \\ge 7^{\\frac{1}{7}-1} = 7^{-\\frac{6}{7}}$, but this is not an integer.\n\nIf $n = 8$, then $k \\ge 8^{\\frac{1}{8}-1} = 8^{-\\frac{7}{8}}$, but this is not an integer.\n\nHowever, if $n = 9$, then $k \\ge 9^{\\frac{1}{9}-1} = 9^{-\\frac{8}{9}} = \\frac{1}{9^{\\frac{8}{9}}} = \\frac{1}{(3^2)^{\\frac{8}{9}}} = \\frac{1}{3^{\\frac{16}{9}}}$. However, since $k$ is an integer we should test $n=3$ with the next integer after $3^{\\frac{1}{3}-1}$ and find it's $k=4$. This implies $m=4n=12$, which is not relatively prime with 210.\n\nWe continue testing $n$ with the next possible integer. We have $n = 10$. Then, \n\n$$k \\ge 10^{\\frac{1}{10}-1} = 10^{-\\frac{9}{10}} = \\frac{1}{10^{\\frac{9}{10}}} = \\frac{1}{10^9 \\times 10^{-\\frac{1}{10}}}$$. \n\nHowever, this is not an integer.\n\nSince, we cannot find an integer $k$ for $n=10$, we test the next possible integer which is $n = 11$.\n\nThen, \n$$k \\ge 11^{\\frac{1}{11}-1} = 11^{-\\frac{10}{11}} = \\frac{1}{11^{10}}$$\n\nHowever, this is not an integer.\n\nSince, we cannot find an integer $k$ for $n=11$, we test the next possible integer which is $n = 12$.\n\nThen, \n\n$$k \\ge 12^{\\frac{1}{12}-1} = 12^{-\\frac{11}{12}} = \\frac{1}{12^{11}}$$\n\nHowever, this is not an integer.\n\nSince, we cannot find an integer $k$ for $n=12$, we test the next possible integer which is $n = 13$.\n\nThen, \n\n$$k \\ge 13^{\\frac{1}{13}-1} = 13^{-\\frac{12}{13}} = \\frac{1}{13^{12}}$$ \n\nHowever, this is not an integer.\n\nThus, we continue this process until we find an integer value for $k$.\n\nIf we test $n = 14$, then $k \\ge 14^{\\frac{1}{14}-1} = 14^{-\\frac{13}{14}} = \\frac{1}{14^{13}}$, which is not an integer.\n\nIf we test $n = 15$, then $k \\ge 15^{\\frac{1}{15}-1} = 15^{-\\frac{14}{15}} = \\frac{1}{15^{14}}$, which is not an integer.\n\nIf we test $n = 16$, then $k \\ge 16^{\\frac{1}{16}-1} = 16^{-\\frac{15}{16}} = \\frac{1}{16^{15}}$, which is not an integer.\n\nIf we test $n = 17$, then $k \\ge 17^{\\frac{1}{17}-1} = 17^{-\\frac{16}{17}} = \\frac{1}{17^{16}}$, which is not an integer.\n\nIf we test $n = 18$, then $k \\ge 18^{\\frac{1}{18}-1} = 18^{-\\frac{17}{18}} = \\frac{1}{18^{17}}$, which is not an integer.\n\nIf we test $n = 19$, then $k \\ge 19^{\\frac{1}{19}-1} = 19^{-\\frac{18}{19}} = \\frac{1}{19^{18}}$, which is not an integer.\n\nIf we test $n = 20$, then $k \\ge 20^{\\frac{1}{20}-1} = 20^{-\\frac{19}{20}} = \\frac{1}{20^{19}}$, which is not an integer.\n\nIf we test $n = 21$, then $k \\ge 21^{\\frac{1}{21}-1} = 21^{-\\frac{20}{21}} = \\frac{1}{21^{20}}$, which is not an integer.\n\nIf we test $n = 22$, then $k \\ge 22^{\\frac{1}{22}-1} = 22^{-\\frac{21}{22}} = \\frac{1}{22^{21}}$, which is not an integer.\n\nIf we test $n = 23$, then $k \\ge 23^{\\frac{1}{23}-1} = 23^{-\\frac{22}{23}} = \\frac{1}{23^{22}}$, which is not an integer.\n\nIf we test $n = 24$, then $k \\ge 24^{\\frac{1}{24}-1} = 24^{-\\frac{23}{24}} = \\frac{1}{24^{23}}$, which is not an integer.\n\nHowever, if we test $n = 25$, we get $k \\ge 25^{\\frac{1}{25}-1} = 25^{-\\frac{24}{25}} = \\frac{1}{25^{24}}$. Since $25^{24}$ is not a multiple of any prime number other than $5$ and the smallest power of $5$ that is greater than $1$ and is a multiple of $25^{24}$ is $5^4=625$, we consider the next smallest power of $5$ that is greater than $1$ and is a multiple of $25^{24}$.
