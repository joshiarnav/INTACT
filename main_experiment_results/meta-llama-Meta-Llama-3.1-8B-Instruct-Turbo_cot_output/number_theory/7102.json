    "problem": "For a positive integer $n$ and nonzero digits $a$, $b$, and $c$, let $A_n$ be the $n$-digit integer each of whose digits is equal to $a$; let $B_n$ be the $n$-digit integer each of whose digits is equal to $b$, and let $C_n$ be the $2n$-digit (not $n$-digit) integer each of whose digits is equal to $c$. What is the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$ for which there are at least two values of $n$ such that $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$?\n$\\textbf{(A)} \\text{ 12} \\qquad \\textbf{(B)} \\text{ 14} \\qquad \\textbf{(C)} \\text{ 16} \\qquad \\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 18} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)} \\text{ 20}$\n",
    "solution": "Observe $A_n = a(1 + 10 + \\dots + 10^{n - 1}) = a \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$; similarly $B_n = b \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ and $C_n = c \\cdot \\tfrac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}$. The relation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$ rewrites as\\[c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = a^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\right)^2.\\]Since $n > 0$, $10^n > 1$ and we may cancel out a factor of $\\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ to obtain\\[c \\cdot (10^n + 1) - b = a^2 \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}.\\]This is a linear equation in $10^n$. Thus, if two distinct values of $n$ satisfy it, then all values of $n$ will. Now we plug in $n=0$ and $n=1$ (or some other number), we get $2c - b = 0$ and $11c - b= a^2$ . Solving the equations for $c$ and $b$, we get\\[c = \\frac{a^2}{9} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c - b = -\\frac{a^2}{9} \\implies b = \\frac{2a^2}{9}.\\]To maximize $a + b + c = a + \\tfrac{a^2}{3}$, we need to maximize $a$. Since $b$ and $c$ must be integers, $a$ must be a multiple of $3$. If $a = 9$ then $b$ exceeds $9$. However, if $a = 6$ then $b = 8$ and $c = 4$ for an answer of $\\boxed{18}$.",

    "model_solution": "We first need to understand that $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$ represent numbers composed of the digits $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively. Each of $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$ has $n$ digits, except $C_n$, which has $2n$ digits.\n\nTo begin, we find the values of $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$ as follows:\n\\[A_n = a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\]\n\\[B_n = b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\]\n\\[C_n = c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}\\]\n\nWe are given the equation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$. Substituting the expressions of $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$ into the equation, we get\n\\begin{align*}\nc \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} &= \\left(a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\right)^2 \\\\\nc \\cdot \\frac{100^n - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} &= a^2 \\cdot \\frac{(10^n - 1)^2}{81} \\\\\n\\frac{100^n - 1}{9} (c - b) &= \\frac{(10^n - 1)^2}{81} a^2 \\\\\n\\frac{10^n - 1}{9} (c - b) &= \\frac{(10^n - 1)(10^n + 1)}{81} a^2\n\\end{align*}\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits, we are looking for a maximum value of $a + b + c$. To maximize this, we want to maximize $a$, $b$, and $c$. Notice that the numbers on the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the equation are both positive. For the right-hand side to be larger than the left-hand side, $a^2$ must be greater than or equal to $(c-b)$. Notice that the numbers $a^2$, $b$, and $c$ are all single-digit numbers, which means they can only be $1,4,9,6$ or $5$.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the fact that $c - b$ could be negative, in which case it's possible that $(c-b)$ could be $-1$. However, if $(c-b) = -1$, then we have $a^2 \\geq 1$ so the only possible values of $a$ are $1$ and $2$. However, $a = 2$ is not a possible value for the same reason that $b = a$ is not a possible value. Therefore, the only possible values of $a$ are $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nNow, we can compute the value of $a^2$, and we can determine the range of values that $c-b$ can take. In order to do so, we compute the value of $a^2$:\n\\[a^2 = 1^2 = 1\\]\n\nWe have determined that the only possible value of $a$ is $1$. We now use this to compute the value of $a^2$ and to determine the range of values that $c-b$ can take. We have $a^2 = 1$, so the equation becomes:\n\\[\\frac{10^n - 1}{9} (c-b) = \\frac{(10^n - 1)(10^n + 1)}{81}.\\]\n\nTo find the range of possible values for $(c-b)$, we must solve for $(c-b)$. We can do so by multiplying both sides by $81$ and dividing both sides by $(10^n - 1)$:\n\\begin{align*}\n81 \\cdot \\frac{(10^n - 1)(10^n + 1)}{81} &= (c - b) \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\\\\n(10^n + 1)(10^n - 1) &= (c - b) \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} \\cdot 9 \\\\\n(c - b) &= \\frac{(10^n + 1)(10^n - 1)}{9} \\\\\n(c - b) &= \\frac{100^n - 1}{9} \\\\\n(c - b) &= \\frac{(10^n - 1)(10^n + 1)}{9} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTo find the range of possible values for $(c-b)$, we can use the fact that $0 \\leq (c-b) \\leq 9$ to solve for the minimum and maximum values of $n$. We will find the minimum and maximum values of $n$ in the following two steps:\n\nStep 1: Finding the minimum value of $n$\n\nTo find the minimum value of $n$, we need to consider all possible values of $(c-b)$.\n\nSince $c - b$ must be a nonnegative integer less than or equal to $9$, the largest possible value of $c$ is $9$ when $b$ is $0$.\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of $n$:\n\\begin{align*}\n(c - b) &= \\frac{(10^n - 1)(10^n + 1)}{9} \\\\\n0 &= (10^n - 1)(10^n + 1) \\\\\n0 &= 10^{2n} - 1 \\\\\n0 &= 10^{2n} - (10^n)^2 \\\\\n0 &= (10^n)^2 - 1 \\\\\n0 &= (10^n)^2 - 1^2 \\\\\n0 &= (10^n - 1)((10^n + 1)) \\\\\n0 &= 10^n - 1 \\\\\n1 &= 10^n \\\\\nn &= \\log_{10}1 \\\\\nn &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nTo find the largest possible value of $n$ such that $(c-b) \\geq 0$, we need to ensure that $(c-b)$ is a nonnegative integer. Since $(c-b)$ must be a nonnegative integer, we find that $n$ must be a nonnegative integer. Thus, the minimum value of $n$ is $0$.\n\nStep 2: Finding the maximum value of $n$\n\nWe find that $(c-b)$ can be $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, or $9$.\n\nTo determine the maximum value of $n$, we need to consider all possible values of $(c-b)$. Since $c-b$ must be a nonnegative integer less than or equal to $9$, we can use the following equation to solve for the maximum value of $n$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(c - b) &= \\frac{(10^n - 1)(10^n + 1)}{9} \\\\\n(c - b) &= \\frac{100^n - 1}{9} \\\\\n(c - b) &= \\frac{(10^n - 1)(10^n + 1)}{9}\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe find that $(c-b)$ must be a nonnegative integer less than or equal to $9$. To find the maximum value of $n$ such that $(c-b)$ is a nonnegative integer, we must ensure that $(c-b)$ is a nonnegative integer.\n\nSince $c-b$ must be a nonnegative integer, we find that $n$ can take any positive integer value. Thus, the maximum value of $n$ is infinite.\n\nHowever, we must find the maximum value of $n$ that satisfies the following equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(c - b) &= \\frac{(10^n - 1)(10^n + 1)}{9} \\\\\n(c - b) &= \\frac{(10^n)^2 - 1}{9} \\\\\n(c - b) &= \\frac{(10^n)^2 - 1}{9}\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow we need to find the maximum value of $n$ that satisfies the above equation. We can do so by considering the value of $(c-b)$. We find that $(c-b)$ can be $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, or $9$.\n\nSince $(c-b)$ must be a nonnegative integer less than or equal to $9$, we find that the maximum value of $n$ that satisfies the equation is $3$. Thus, the maximum value of $n$ is $\\boxed{3}$.\n\nNow, we can find the possible values of $c$, $b$, and $a$. We know that $a$ must be $1$ and that $(c-b)$ can be $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, or $9$.\n\nNow we can find the possible values of $c$, $b$, and $a$:\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 1 \\\\\n(c - b) &= 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, \\text{ or } 9\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $a$ must be $1$, we can substitute $a = 1$ into the equation and solve for $c$ and $b$:\n\\"
