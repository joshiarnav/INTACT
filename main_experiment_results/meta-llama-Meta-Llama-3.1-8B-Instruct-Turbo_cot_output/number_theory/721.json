    "solution": "The first odd multiple of 3 is 3. The next is 9, then 15, 21, adding 6 each time. The $n$th odd multiple of 3 is $6n-3$; the 10th odd multiple of 3 is therefore $60-3=\\boxed{57}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and! a multiple of 3, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the pattern for odd multiples of 3:\n   The odd multiples of 3 follow the pattern 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, ...\n\n2. Notice the sequence:\n   From the pattern, we can see that each number is 6 more than the previous one.\n\n3. Understand that we need the 10th number in this sequence:\n   Since the sequence starts with 3, we can use the formula for an arithmetic sequence to find the 10th term. The formula is: \n   a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, \n   where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference.\n\n4. Plug in the values:\n   a_1 (first term) = 3\n   n (term number) = 10\n   d (common difference) = 6\n\n5. Use the formula:\n   a_10 = 3 + (10 - 1)6\n   a_10 = 3 + 9(6)\n   a_10 = 3 + 54\n   a_10 = 57\n\nTherefore, the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is 57."
