However, in this case, we can simply take the integer part of the quotient (ignoring the decimal), multiply it by the divisor, and subtract that from the dividend.\n\n$-467 \\times 8 = -3744$\n\nNow, subtract $-3744$ from $-3737$.\n\n$-3737 - (-3744) = -3737 + 3744 = 7$\n\nStep 3: Find the value of $n$ that satisfies $n \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}$.\n\nSince $-3737 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}$, the integer $n$ that satisfies the equation $n \\equiv -3737 \\pmod{8}$ is $n = 7$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{7}$."
