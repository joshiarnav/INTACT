    "solution": "The units digit of $mn$ is $1^6 = 1$.  Searching for a units digit for $n$ (which is clearly odd), we find that $7 \\cdot 3 = 1$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit of $n$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the units digit of $n$, we first need to find the units digit of $21^6$. \n\nThe units digit of $21$ is $1$. \n\nNow, let's consider the pattern of units digits for powers of $1$. \n\nSince the units digit of any power of $1$ is always $1$, the units digit of $21^6$ is $1$.\n\nNow, we know that $mn = 21^6$. Therefore, the units digit of the product $mn$ is $1$.\n\nSince the units digit of $m$ is $7$, and the units digit of $mn$ is $1$, we need to find a number whose units digit, when multiplied by $7$, gives $1$.\n\nLet's consider the units digits of the product of $7$ with the digits $0$ through $9$.\n\n- $7 \\times 0 = 0$\n- $7 \\times 1 = 7$\n- $7 \\times 2 = 14$, so the units digit is $4$\n- $7 \\times 3 = 21$, so the units digit is $1$\n- $7 \\times 4 = 28$, so the units digit is $8$\n- $7 \\times 5 = 35$, so the units digit is $5$\n- $7 \\times 6 = 42$, so the units digit is $2$\n- $7 \\times 7 = 49$, so the units digit is $9$\n- $7 \\times 8 = 56$, so the units digit is $6$\n- $7 \\times 9 = 63$, so the units digit is $3$\n\nFrom the above list, we see that the units digit of $7$ multiplied by $3$ gives $1$.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $n$ is $\\boxed{3}$."
