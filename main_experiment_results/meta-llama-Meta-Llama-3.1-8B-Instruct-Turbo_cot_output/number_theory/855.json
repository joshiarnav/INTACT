    "problem": "What is $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\pmod{25}$? Express your answer as an integer from $0$ to $24$, inclusive.",
    "solution": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 3 and 9 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 13 + \\frac 19 \\equiv \\frac{9 + 3}{27} \\equiv \\frac{12}{2} \\equiv \\boxed{6} \\pmod{25}.$$We can justify this as follows: let $a \\equiv 3^{-1} \\pmod{25}$ and $b \\equiv 9^{-1} \\pmod{25}$. Then $27a \\equiv 9 \\pmod{25}$ and $27b \\equiv 3 \\pmod{25}$. Summing these congruences shows that $27(a+b) \\equiv 2(a+b) \\equiv 9 + 3 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{25}$, so $a+b \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}$, as desired.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:\n\n1. **Find the inverse of 3 mod 25**: \nWe need to find a number x such that $3x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nTo do this, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\n\nHowever, a simpler approach for small numbers is to try multiplying 3 by all numbers from 1 to 24 and see which one gives a product that is 1 more than a multiple of 25.\n\nAfter trying, we find that $3 \\cdot 17 \\equiv 51 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$, so the inverse of 3 mod 25 is 17.\n\n2. **Express $3^{-1}$ and $3^{-2}$ in terms of their inverses**:\n\nWe know that $3^{-1} \\equiv 17 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nUsing the property of exponents that $a^{-n} = (a^{-1})^n$, we have:\n\n$3^{-2} \\equiv (3^{-1})^2 \\equiv 17^2 \\equiv 289 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{25}$.\n\n3. **Add $3^{-1}$ and $3^{-2}$ modulo 25**:\n\nNow we add the two expressions:\n\n$3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\equiv 17 + 14 \\equiv 31 \\equiv \\boxed{6} \\pmod{25}$.\n\nSo the final answer is 6."
