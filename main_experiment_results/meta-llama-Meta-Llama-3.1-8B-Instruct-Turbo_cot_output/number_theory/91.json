    "problem": "For some positive integer $k$, when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. What is the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$?",
    "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "We are given that when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. \n\nThis can be expressed mathematically as: \n$$60 = a \\cdot k^2 + 6$$\nwhere $a$ is the quotient obtained when 60 is divided by $k^2$.\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides, we get:\n$$54 = a \\cdot k^2$$\n\nSince $54 = 2 \\cdot 3^3$, it can be factorized as:\n$$54 = 2 \\cdot 3^3 = (3^2) \\cdot 3$$\n\nHowever, we know that $k^2$ is a factor of 54. To find $k^2$, we can list the possible factors of 54:\n- $1 \\times 54$\n- $2 \\times 27$\n- $3 \\times 18$\n- $6 \\times 9$\n\nSince $k^2$ is a factor of 54, $k$ must be a factor of $\\sqrt{54}$.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $k$ are:\n- $1$\n- $3$\n- $\\sqrt{6}$\n- $\\sqrt{18}$\n\nHowever, since the remainder is 6, we can write $60 = a \\cdot k^2 + 6 = a \\cdot k^2 + 2 \\cdot 3$, so $k^2$ must be divisible by 3. Thus, $\\sqrt{6}$ and $\\sqrt{18}$ cannot be $k$, as they are not divisible by 3.\n\nSo, the possible values of $k$ are $1$ and $3$.\n\nHowever, since 60 divided by $k^2$ leaves a remainder of 6, and $k^2 = 9$, then k is 3.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$ can be found as follows:\n\n$$\\text{Remainder} = 100 \\mod k = 100 \\mod 3 = 1.$$"
