    "model_solution": "To find the integer $n$ that satisfies the given congruence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the congruence**: The given congruence is $n \\equiv 7882 \\pmod{5}$. This means that when $7882$ is divided by $5$, the remainder is equal to the remainder when $n$ is divided by $5$.\n\n2. **Find the remainder of $7882$ when divided by $5$**: To find the remainder, we can use the modulo operation or simply divide $7882$ by $5$. \n\n   $7882 \\div 5 = 1576$ with a remainder of $2$. So, $7882 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n\n3. **Since $n \\equiv 7882 \\pmod{5}$, we have $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$**: Since $7882 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$, we can replace $7882$ in the original congruence with $2$. This gives us $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n\n4. **Find the integer $n$ in the range $4 \\le n \\le 8$ that satisfies $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$**: We need to find an integer $n$ between $4$ and $8$ (inclusive) that leaves a remainder of $2$ when divided by $5$.\n\n   - $4$ leaves a remainder of $4$ when divided by $5$.\n   - $5$ leaves a remainder of $0$ when divided by $5$.\n   - $6$ leaves a remainder of $1$ when divided by $5$.\n   - $7$ leaves a remainder of $2$ when divided by $5$.\n   - $8$ leaves a remainder of $3$ when divided by $5$.\n\n   Therefore, the integer $n$ that satisfies the given congruence is $\\boxed{7}$."
