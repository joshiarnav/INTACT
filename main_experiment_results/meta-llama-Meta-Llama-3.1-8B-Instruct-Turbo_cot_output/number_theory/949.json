    "problem": "The solution of $8x+1\\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$ is $x\\equiv a\\pmod{m}$ for some positive integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a<m$. Find $a+m$.",
    "solution": "Subtract 1 from both sides to obtain $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$. Add 12 to the right-hand side to get $8x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{12}$. Now divide both sides by 8, remembering to divide 12 by the greatest common factor of 12 and 8, thus obtaining $x \\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. This gives $a+m = 2 + 3 = \\boxed{5}$. Here we have used the fact that $ad \\equiv bd\\pmod{m}$ if and only if $a\\equiv b \\pmod{m/\\text{gcd}(m,d)}$, for integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a$, $b$, and $d$.",

Divide both sides by 4 (since 4 and 12 are not coprime, we need to divide by their greatest common divisor, which is 4):\n   $\\frac{8x}{4} \\equiv \\frac{4}{4} \\pmod{\\frac{12}{4}}$\n   $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$\n\n3. Multiply both sides by 2 (to get rid of the coefficient 2):\n   $2(2x) \\equiv 2(1) \\pmod{3}$\n   $4x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$\n\n4. Subtract 3 from both sides (to make the coefficient 4 and 3 coprime):\n   Since 4 and 3 are coprime, we can subtract 3 from both sides:\n   $4x - 3x \\equiv 2 - 3 \\pmod{3}$\n   $x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{3}$\n\nNow we have $x\\equiv a\\pmod{m}$, where $a = -1$ and $m = 3$.\n\nThe problem asks for $a+m$, which is:\n   $a + m = -1 + 3 = 2$\n\nSo the answer is $a+m = 2$."
