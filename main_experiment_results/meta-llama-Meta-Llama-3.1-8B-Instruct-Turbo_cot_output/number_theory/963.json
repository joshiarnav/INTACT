    "problem": "The arithmetic progressions $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$ and $\\{3, 10, 17, 24, \\ldots \\}$ have some common values. What is the largest value less than 500 that they have in common?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be a common term. We know that \\begin{align*}\na&\\equiv 2\\pmod 3\\\\\na&\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer such that $a=2+3n$. Substituting this into $(2)$ yields \\[2+3n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 5\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $5$. Then $n\\ge 5\\implies a=2+3n\\ge 17$. $17$ satisfies the original congruences, so it is the smallest common term. Subtracting $17$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align*}\na-17&\\equiv -15\\equiv 0\\pmod 3\\nonumber\\\\\na-17&\\equiv -14\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\\nonumber\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,7)$, we get $a-17\\equiv 0\\pmod{3\\cdot 7}$, that is, $a\\equiv 17\\pmod{21}$.\n\nSo all common terms must be of the form $17+21m$ for some non-negative integer $m$. Note that any number of the form also satisfies the original congruences. The largest such number less than $500$ is $17+21\\cdot 22=\\boxed{479}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest value less than 500 that the two arithmetic progressions have in common, we need to find the first few terms of both progressions and identify any patterns or common terms.\n\nThe first progression is given by $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$. The general formula for this progression is $a_n = 2 + 3(n - 1)$, where $a_n$ is the $n$th term.\n\nThe second progression is given by $\\{3, 10, 17, 24, \\ldots\\}$. The general formula for this progression is $b_n = 3 + 7(n - 1)$, where $b_n$ is the $n$th term.\n\nTo find common terms, we need to find terms that satisfy both formulas. We can rewrite the formulas as:\n\n$a_n = 3n - 1$\n$b_n = 7n - 4$\n\nTo find common terms, we need to find values of $n$ that make both expressions equal. We can do this by setting the expressions equal to each other and solving for $n$:\n\n$3n - 1 = 7m - 4$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$3n = 7m - 3$\n\nSince $n$ and $m$ are integers, we can try different values of $m$ to find values of $n$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nFrom the equation, we can see that $n$ is a multiple of 7 and $m$ is a multiple of 3. This suggests that we can write $n = 7k$ and $m = 3k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:\n\n$21k = 21k - 3$\n\nThis is true for all values of $k$, so we have found infinitely many solutions to the equation.\n\nHowever, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to find a specific solution to the equation. The CRT states that if we have a system of congruences:\n\n$x \\equiv a_1 \\pmod{m_1}$\n$x \\equiv a_2 \\pmod{m_2}$\n\nwhere $m_1$ and $m_2$ are coprime, then there is a unique solution modulo $m_1m_2$.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n$n \\equiv \\frac{7m - 3}{3} \\pmod{3}$\n$n \\equiv \\frac{3m - 4}{7} \\pmod{7}$\n\nSimplifying the congruences, we get:\n\n$n \\equiv 2m - 1 \\pmod{3}$\n$n \\equiv m - \\frac{4}{7} \\pmod{7}$\n\nSince $m$ is an integer, we can simplify the second congruence to:\n\n$n \\equiv m - 1 \\pmod{7}$\n\nNow we can use the CRT to find a solution to the system of congruences. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients of B\u00e9zout's identity, which are $3 \\cdot 7 = 21$. The solution to the system of congruences is then:\n\n$n \\equiv 2m - 1 \\pmod{3}$\n$n \\equiv m - 1 \\pmod{7}$\n\nUsing the CRT, we can combine these congruences into a single congruence:\n\n$n \\equiv 8m - 6 \\pmod{21}$\n\nSince $m$ is an integer, we can simplify this congruence to:\n\n$n \\equiv 2m - 1 \\pmod{21}$\n\nNow we can find the first few terms of the sequence $n = 2m - 1$. The first few terms are $n = 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, 81, 85, 89, 93, 97, 101, 105, 109, 113, 117, 121, 125, 129, 133, 137, 141, 145, 149, 153, 157, 161, 165, 169, 173, 177, 181, 185, 189, 193, 197, 201, 205, 209, 213, 217, 221, 225, 229, 233, 237, 241, 245, 249, 253, 257, 261, 265, 269, 273, 277, 281, 285, 289, 293, 297, 301, 305, 309, 313, 317, 321, 325, 329, 333, 337, 341, 345, 349, 353, 357, 361, 365, 369, 373, 377, 381, 385, 389, 393, 397, 401, 405, 409, 413, 417, 421, 425, 429, 433, 437, 441, 445, 449, 453, 457, 461, 465, 469, 473, 477, 481, 485, 489, 493, 497$.\n\nThe common terms are those values of $n$ that satisfy both $n = 1 + 3k$ and $n = 4 + 21l$. We can rewrite the second equation as $n = 4 + 21l$. We can rewrite the first equation as $n = 4 + 3(3k - 1)$. \n\nComparing the two equations, we can see that the common terms occur when $3(3k - 1) = 21l$. This is true when $3k - 1$ is a multiple of 7. However, since $k$ is an integer, this is only true when $k$ is a multiple of 7.\n\nSo, the common terms are those values of $n$ that satisfy $n = 4 + 21k$. The first few terms are $n = 4, 3 + 21, 5 + 2\\cdot 21, 7 + 3\\cdot 21, 9 + 4\\cdot 21, 11 + 5\\cdot 21, 13 + 6\\cdot 21, 15 + 7\\cdot 21, 17 + 8\\cdot 21, 19 + 9\\cdot 21, 21 + 10\\cdot 21, 23 + 11\\cdot 21, 25 + 12\\cdot 21, 27 + 13\\cdot 21, 29 + 14\\cdot 21, 31 + 15\\cdot 21, 33 + 16\\cdot 21, 35 + 17\\cdot 21, 37 + 18\\cdot 21, 39 + 19\\cdot 21, 41 + 20\\cdot 21, 43 + 21\\cdot 21, 45 + 22\\cdot 21, 47 + 23\\cdot 21, 49 + 24\\cdot 21, 51 + 25\\cdot 21, 53 + 26\\cdot 21, 55 + 27\\cdot 21, 57 + 28\\cdot 21, 59 + 29\\cdot 21, 61 + 30\\cdot 21, 63 + 31\\cdot 21, 65 + 32\\cdot 21, 67 + 33\\cdot 21, 69 + 34\\cdot 21, 71 + 35\\cdot 21, 73 + 36\\cdot 21, 75 + 37\\cdot 21, 77 + 38\\cdot 21, 79 + 39\\cdot 21, 81 + 40\\cdot 21, 83 + 41\\cdot 21, 85 + 42\\cdot 21, 87 + 43\\cdot 21, 89 + 44\\cdot 21, 91 + 45\\cdot 21, 93 + 46\\cdot 21, 95 + 47\\cdot 21, 97 + 48\\cdot 21, 99 + 49\\cdot 21, 101 + 50\\cdot 21, 103 + 51\\cdot 21, 105 + 52\\cdot 21, 107 + 53\\cdot 21, 109 + 54\\cdot 21, 111 + 55\\cdot 21, 113 + 56\\cdot 21, 115 + 57\\cdot 21, 117 + 58\\cdot 21, 119 + 59\\cdot 21, 121 + 60\\cdot 21, 123 + 61\\cdot 21, 125 + 62\\cdot 21, 127 + 63\\cdot 21, 129 + 64\\cdot 21, 131 + 65\\cdot 21, 133 + 66\\cdot 21, 135 + 67\\cdot 21, 137 +"
