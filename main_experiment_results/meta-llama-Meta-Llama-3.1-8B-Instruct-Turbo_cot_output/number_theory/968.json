    "problem": "Three different natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors. How many factors does $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ have?",
    "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",

    "model_solution": "We know that $x$, $y$, and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors. Since the number of factors of a number is determined by its prime factorization, we can assume that each of $x$, $y$, and $z$ is a square of a prime number. \n\nLet's say $x=p^2$, $y=q^2$, and $z=r^2$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are distinct prime numbers. \n\nNow, we want to find the number of factors of $x^2y^3z^4$. \n\nFirst, we can express $x^2y^3z^4$ as $(p^2)^2(q^2)^3(r^2)^4$. \n\nUsing the laws of exponents, we have $x^2y^3z^4 = (p^2)^2(q^2)^3(r^2)^4 = p^4q^6r^8$.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that if a number $n$ has a prime factorization of $p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}...p_k^{a_k}$, then the number of factors of $n$ is given by $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)...(a_k + 1)$.\n\nApplying this to $x^2y^3z^4 = p^4q^6r^8$, we get that the number of factors of $x^2y^3z^4$ is given by $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)$. \n\nEvaluating this expression, we get $5 \\times 7 \\times 9 = 315$. \n\nTherefore, the number of factors of $x^2y^3z^4$ is $315$."
