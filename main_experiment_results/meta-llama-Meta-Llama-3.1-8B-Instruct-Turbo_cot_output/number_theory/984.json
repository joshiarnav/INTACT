    "problem": "Natural numbers of the form $F_n=2^{2^n} + 1 $ are called Fermat numbers. In 1640, Fermat conjectured that all numbers $F_n$, where $n\\neq 0$, are prime. (The conjecture was later shown to be false.) What is the units digit of $F_{1000}$?",
    "solution": "Let's first try to find the cycle of units digits of $2^n$, starting with $n=1$: $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $2^n$ is 4 digits long: 2, 4, 8, 6. To find the units digit of $2^n$, for any positive integer $n$, we simply need to find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 2, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 4, etc.) Since $2^{1000}\\div4=2^{998}$ without remainder, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6. Therefore, the units digit of $F_n=2^{2^{1000}}+1$ is $6+1=\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the units digit of $F_{1000}$, let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe Fermat number $F_n$ is given by $F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1$. We need to find the units digit of $F_{1000}$, which is equivalent to finding the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}} + 1$.\n\nNow, we can start by finding the pattern of the units digits of powers of 2.\n\nWe know that $2^1 = 2$ (units digit: 2), \n$2^2 = 4$ (units digit: 4), \n$2^3 = 8$ (units digit: 8), \n$2^4 = 16$ (units digit: 6), \n$2^5 = 32$ (units digit: 2), \nand so on.\n\nWe see that the units digits of powers of 2 form a repeating cycle of length 4: {2, 4, 8, 6}.\n\nNow, let's consider the exponent $2^{1000}$. Since the cycle has length 4, we need to find the remainder of $2^{1000}$ when divided by 4 to determine the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$.\n\nSince any power of 2 is always even, $2^{1000}$ is an even number. Therefore, when $2^{1000}$ is divided by 4, the remainder is 0 or 2. However, since $2^{1000}$ is a power of 2, it must be divisible by 4, so the remainder is 0.\n\nWhen the exponent is a multiple of 4, the units digit of the power of 2 is 6. Therefore, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6.\n\nFinally, we add 1 to get the units digit of $F_{1000}$, which is $6 + 1 = 7$.\n\nSo, the units digit of $F_{1000}$ is $\\boxed{7}$."
