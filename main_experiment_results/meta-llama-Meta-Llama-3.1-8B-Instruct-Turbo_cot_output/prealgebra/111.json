    "solution": "Recall that expressions within parentheses should be done first. In the inner set of parentheses, we have $6+1-4=3.$ So, the outer set of parentheses can be rewritten as $21\\div3=7.$ Finally, \\[(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5=7\\cdot5=\\boxed{35}.\\]",

Replace the expression with its value: \n   $(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) = (21 \\div 3)$\n\n3. Evaluate the division: \n   $21 \\div 3 = 7$\n\n4. Replace the division with its value: \n   $(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5 = 7 \\cdot 5$\n\n5. Multiply 7 by 5: \n   $7 \\cdot 5 = 35$\n\nThe final answer is 35."
