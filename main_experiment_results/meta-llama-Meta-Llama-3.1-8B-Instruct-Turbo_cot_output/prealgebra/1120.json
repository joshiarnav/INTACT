    "model_solution": "To find the area of the shaded L-shaped region, we need to break it down into smaller regions whose areas we can easily calculate.\n\nFirst, let's identify the regions. There's a large square with side length 4, two smaller squares with side lengths 1 and 3, and the shaded L-shaped region. We want to find the area of the shaded region.\n\nTo find the area of the shaded region, we'll subtract the areas of the two smaller squares from the area of the large square.\n\nThe area of the large square is $4^2 = 16$.\n\nThe area of one of the smaller squares with side length 1 is $1^2 = 1$.\n\nThe area of the other smaller square with side length 3 is $3^2 = 9$.\n\nHowever, the smaller squares overlap the large square, so we need to subtract the area of the overlap. The overlap consists of two smaller squares with side lengths 1 and 3. We've already calculated their areas: $1^2 = 1$ and $3^2 = 9$. But these are the areas of the squares as part of the original square, and so the overlap is just 1 + 3 = 4. \n\nHowever, the area of the overlap is actually 4 since the square with side length 4 has 1's and 3's as parts of the sides. So we should look at these parts differently.\n\nThe 3-3 part of the square we already have as 9 (for the 3*3 square), but the 1's are part of the 4*4 square, so we already counted them.\n\nHowever, we do need to look at the 1's differently as we do not need to count the 1's as part of the 4*4 square we are looking at as we have already counted them.\n\nSo when we subtract the areas of the smaller squares from the area of the large square, we get $16 - (1 + 3) = 16 - 4 = 12$.\n\nHowever, we should be looking at the problem differently. \n\nIf we draw a line from the bottom left corner of the smaller 3*3 square to the top right corner of the smaller 1*1 square, we will create a 2*2 square. We can see that the shaded region is a 3*2 rectangle minus the 2*2 square.\n\nThe area of the 3*2 rectangle is 3*2 = 6.\n\nThe area of the 2*2 square is 2^2 = 4.\n\nSo we need to subtract the area of the 2*2 square from the area of the 3*2 rectangle to get the area of the shaded region:\n\n6 - 4 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the area of the shaded L-shaped region is 2."
