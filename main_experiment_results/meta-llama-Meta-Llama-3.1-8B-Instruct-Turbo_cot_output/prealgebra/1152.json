    "model_solution": "To find the cube of the square of the second smallest prime number, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the prime numbers: The prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The first few prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.\n\n2. Identify the second smallest prime number: The first prime number is 2, and the second smallest prime number is 3.\n\n3. Find the square of the second smallest prime number: The square of 3 is 3 * 3 = 9.\n\n4. Find the cube of the square of the second smallest prime number: The cube of 9 is 9 * 9 * 9 = 729.\n\nTherefore, the cube of the square of the second smallest prime number is 729."
