    "problem": "Chloe wants to buy a hoodie that costs $\\$32.75$. She empties her wallet and finds she only has three $\\$10$ bills, eight quarters, and a pile of dimes. What is the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ represent the unknown number of dimes. Chloe's total amount of money is $$3(\\$10)+8(\\$.25)+n(\\$.10) \\ge \\$32.75.$$Simplifying gives  \\begin{align*}\n30+2+.10n &\\ge 32.75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\n.10n &\\ge .75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge \\frac{.75}{.10} \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge 7.5.\n\\end{align*}Chloe must have at least $\\boxed{8}$ dimes in her pile.",

    "model_solution": "To find the minimum number of dimes Chloe needs, we need to first calculate the total amount of money she has without the dimes. \n\n1. She has three $\\$10$ bills. That's a total of $3 \\times 10 = 30$ dollars.\n2. She has eight quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25$, so that's a total of $8 \\times 0.25 = 2$ dollars.\n3. Now, let's add the value of the $\\$10$ bills and the quarters to find the total amount of money she has without the dimes. That is $30 + 2 = 32$ dollars.\n\nThe hoodie costs $\\$32.75$. We already have $\\$32$ from the $\\$10$ bills and the quarters, but we still need $\\$0.75$ to pay for the hoodie. \n\nSince we are looking for the minimum number of dimes, we want to use the largest possible denomination of coin to make up the remaining amount. However, we already used quarters to make up the $\\$2$ value (from the 8 quarters). Therefore, we cannot add any more quarters but instead can use dimes.\n\nEach dime is worth $0.10$. To find the minimum number of dimes, we need to divide the remaining amount ($\\$0.75$) by the value of a dime ($\\$0.10$). \n\n$\\frac{0.75}{0.10} = 7.5$\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a coin, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Chloe needs at least 8 dimes.\n\nAnswer: The minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie is 8."
