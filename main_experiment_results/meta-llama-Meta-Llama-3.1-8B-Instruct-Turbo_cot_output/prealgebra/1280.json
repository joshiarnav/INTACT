    "problem": "The number 74 can be factored as 2(37), so 74 is said to have two distinct prime factors. How many distinct prime factors does 210 have?",
    "solution": "We know that $210 = 10 \\cdot 21$. Breaking down these factors even further, we have that $10 = 2 \\cdot 5$ and $21 = 3 \\cdot 7$, so $210 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. Since these factors are all prime, $210$ has $\\boxed{4}$ distinct prime factors.",

    "model_solution": "To find the distinct prime factors of 210, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start by finding the smallest prime factor of 210. We can do this by checking the divisibility by small prime numbers like 2, 3, 5, etc. \n   Since 210 is an even number, it is divisible by 2. So, the first step is to divide 210 by 2.\n\n2. Divide 210 by 2: 210 \u00f7 2 = 105\n\n3. Now we have 105, and we need to find its smallest prime factor. 105 is divisible by 3, so divide it by 3.\n\n4. Divide 105 by 3: 105 \u00f7 3 = 35\n\n5. Now we have 35, and we need to find its smallest prime factor. 35 is divisible by 5, so divide it by 5.\n\n6. Divide 35 by 5: 35 \u00f7 5 = 7\n\n7. Now we have 7, and we know that 7 is a prime number. Therefore, the distinct prime factors of 210 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nTherefore, 210 has four distinct prime factors."
