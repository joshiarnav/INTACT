    "model_solution": "To find the least positive integer divisible by each of the first eight positive integers, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\nStep 1: Start with the first integer, which is 1. Since 1 is a factor of every number, we can ignore it for now.\n\nStep 2: Next, consider the number 2. The LCM of 2 is 2 itself.\n\nStep 3: Now, consider the number 3. The LCM of 2 and 3 is 6, since 6 is the smallest number that both 2 and 3 can divide into evenly.\n\nStep 4: Next, consider the number 4. The LCM of 2, 3, and 4 is 12, since 12 is the smallest number that all three can divide into evenly.\n\nStep 5: Now, consider the number 5. The LCM of 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 60, since 60 is the smallest number that all four can divide into evenly.\n\nStep 6: Next, consider the number 6. However, since 6 = 2 * 3, the LCM of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is still 60, since 60 is already divisible by 6.\n\nStep 7: Now, consider the number 7. The LCM of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is 420, since 420 is the smallest number that all six can divide into evenly.\n\nStep 8: Finally, consider the number 8. However, since 8 = 2^3, and 2, 3, 5, and 7 are all relatively prime to 8, we need to multiply 420 by 8/2 = 4 to get 1680.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer divisible by each of the first eight positive integers is 1680."
