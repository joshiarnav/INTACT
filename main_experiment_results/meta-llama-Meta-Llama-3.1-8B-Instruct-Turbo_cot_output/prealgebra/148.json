    "problem": "The average of the numbers 23 and $x$ is 27. What is the positive difference between 23 and $x$? (Recall that the average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2).",
    "solution": "To calculate the average of two numbers, we add them and divide the sum by $2$.  From the given information, we have the equation  \\[\\frac{23+x}{2}=27.\\]  Multiplying both sides by $2$ yields \\[23+x=54.\\]  Thus, $x=54-23=31$.  Finally, the positive difference between $31$ and $23$ is \\[31-23=\\boxed{8}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To find the positive difference between 23 and x, we first need to find the value of x.\n\nStep 1: The average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2. We know the average of 23 and x is 27, so we can write the equation:\n\n(23 + x) / 2 = 27\n\nStep 2: Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n23 + x = 27 * 2\n\nStep 3: Multiply 27 by 2:\n\n23 + x = 54\n\nStep 4: Subtract 23 from both sides to isolate x:\n\nx = 54 - 23\n\nStep 5: Perform the subtraction:\n\nx = 31\n\nStep 6: Now that we know x is 31, we can find the positive difference between 23 and x by subtracting 23 from 31:\n\n31 - 23 = 8\n\nSo, the positive difference between 23 and x is 8."
