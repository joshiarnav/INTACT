    "problem": "The product of three different positive integers is equal to $7^3$. What is the sum of the three integers?",
    "solution": "All three integers must be divisors of $7^3$.  The only divisors of $7^3$ are $7^0$, $7^1$, $7^2$, $7^3$.  We have $7^3=7^0\\times7^1\\times7^2$. Thus our answer is $7^0+7^1+7^2=1+7+49=\\boxed{57}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the three different positive integers, we need to find three distinct factors of $7^3$.\n\nStep 1: Factorize $7^3$. \n$7^3 = 7 * 7 * 7$\n\nStep 2: Identify the distinct factors of $7^3$. \nSince $7^3 = 7 * 7 * 7$, the distinct factors are 1, 7, and $7^2 = 49$. \n\nStep 3: Now we have three distinct factors, 1, 7, and 49. \n\nStep 4: To find the sum of the three integers, we add them together. \nSum = 1 + 7 + 49 \nSum = 57\n\nTherefore, the sum of the three integers is 57."
