    "model_solution": "To find the average monthly balance of David's savings account, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the total amount of money David saved**: \n   - In January (J), the balance was $100.\n   - In February (F), the balance was $200.\n   - In March (M), the balance was $150.\n   - In April (A), the balance was $150.\n   - The total amount of money David saved is: $100 + $200 + $150 + $150 = $600.\n\n2. **Find the average monthly balance**: \n   - To find the average, we divide the total amount of money by the number of months.\n   - There are 4 months in the given period.\n   - Average monthly balance = Total amount / Number of months\n   - Average monthly balance = $600 / 4\n   - Average monthly balance = $150\n\nTherefore, the average monthly balance of David's savings account during the four-month period shown is $150."
