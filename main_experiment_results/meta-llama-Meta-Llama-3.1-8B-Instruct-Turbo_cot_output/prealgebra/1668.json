    "solution": "The chart shows the amounts of sales at the end of each year.  Therefore we're looking for a year on the chart that has the largest difference from the previous year.    Determining the sales that increased the most number of dollars is equivalent to finding the right endpoint of the segment with the steepest slope.  From observation, we can determine that that line corresponds to the year $\\boxed{1998}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the year after 1994 when sales increased the most number of dollars, we need to compare the differences in sales amounts from one year to the next.\n\nLooking at the graph, we can see that the steepest increase in sales is from 1998 to 2000. This is because the line connecting these two points is the steepest on the graph.\n\nWe can calculate the difference in sales amounts as follows:\n\n- From 1997 to 1998: The difference is approximately 0.4 units.\n- From 1998 to 2000: The difference is approximately 0.8 units.\n- From 1999 to 2000: The difference is approximately 0.3 units.\n\nBased on the graph, the largest increase in sales occurred from 1998 to 2000, with a difference of approximately 0.8 units. Therefore, the year after 1994 when sales increased the most number of dollars is 1998."
