    "problem": "Given three members of a group -- Alice, Bob, and Carol -- in how many ways can these three be chosen to be the three officers (president, secretary, and treasurer) of the group, assuming no person holds more than one job?",
    "solution": "In this problem we are choosing a committee, so the order in which we choose the 3 people does not matter.  We could have chosen them in any of the following orders (where A is Alice, B is Bob, and C is Carol): ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.  So each possible committee corresponds to $3! = \\boxed{6}$ possible orderings.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of ways to choose the three officers, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Choosing the President:** We have three options for the president: Alice, Bob, or Carol. So, there are 3 ways to choose the president.\n\n2. **Choosing the Secretary:** After choosing the president, we are left with only two members (Alice or Bob and Carol, or Carol and Bob and Alice) since no person holds more than one job. So, there are 2 ways to choose the secretary.\n\n3. **Choosing the Treasurer:** After choosing the president and the secretary, we are left with only one member (the remaining person not chosen yet). This person automatically becomes the treasurer. There's only 1 way to choose the treasurer.\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to choose the officers, we multiply the number of options for each position:\n\nTotal ways = Number of ways to choose the President \u00d7 Number of ways to choose the Secretary \u00d7 Number of ways to choose the Treasurer\nTotal ways = 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6\n\nTherefore, there are 6 different ways to choose the three officers (president, secretary, and treasurer) from the group consisting of Alice, Bob, and Carol."
