    "problem": "In order to compute the area of a particular circle, Juan first measures the length of its diameter. The actual diameter is 20 cm, but Juan's measurement has an error of up to $20\\%$. What is the largest possible percent error, in percent, in Juan's computed area of the circle?",
    "solution": "Juan can measure the diameter as a length anywhere between $20 - 20\\cdot 0.2 = 16$ and $20 + 20\\cdot 0.2 = 24$  cm. The actual area of the circle is $\\pi (20/2)^2=100\\pi$ square cm, but Juan can compute the area anywhere in the range $\\pi (16/2)^2=64 \\pi$ square cm to $\\pi (24/2)^2=144 \\pi$ square cm. Using the lower bound of the range, Juan's error is $(100\\pi - 64\\pi)/(100\\pi)=36\\%$. Using the upper bound of the range, Juan's error is $(144\\pi - 100\\pi)/(100\\pi)=44\\%$. Thus, the largest possible percent error is $\\boxed{44}$ percent.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest possible percent error, we need to consider the extreme cases of Juan's measurement. \n\nFirst, let's consider the true area of the circle. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is 20 cm, the radius is 10 cm. \n\nTrue Area = \u03c0(10)^2 = 100\u03c0 cm^2\n\nNow, let's consider the largest possible value Juan could have measured for the diameter, which is 20 cm + 20% of 20 cm = 20 + 0.2*20 = 24 cm. \n\nLargest possible measured radius = 12 cm\n\nLargest possible measured area = \u03c0(12)^2 = 144\u03c0 cm^2\n\nThe percent error is given by the formula: \n\nPercent Error = ((Measured value - True value) / True value) * 100\n= ((144\u03c0 - 100\u03c0) / 100\u03c0) * 100\n= (44\u03c0 / 100\u03c0) * 100\n= 44%\n\nSo, the largest possible percent error in Juan's computed area of the circle is 44%."
