    "problem": "According to the table below, how many dollars are in the median value of the 59 salaries paid to this company's employees?\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Position Title}&\\textbf{\\# with Title}&\\textbf{Salary}\\\\\\hline\nPresident&1&$\\$130{,}000$\\\\\\hline\nVice-President&5&$\\$90{,}000$\\\\\\hline\nDirector&10&$\\$75{,}000$\\\\\\hline\nAssociate Director&6&$\\$50{,}000$\\\\\\hline\nAdministrative Specialist&37&$\\$23{,}000$\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}",
    "solution": "Since more than half the employees are Administrative Specialists, the median salary will be an administrative specialist, thus, $\\boxed{\\$23{,}000}$.",
    "total_tokens": 425,
    "time_taken": 8.696710109710693,
    "file_name": "./MATH_subsample_uniform/prealgebra/1896.json",
    "model_solution": "To find the median value of the 59 salaries, we need to first arrange all the salaries in ascending order.\n\n1. The 37 Administrative Specialists have a salary of $23,000.\n2. The 6 Associate Directors have a salary of $50,000.\n3. The 10 Directors have a salary of $75,000.\n4. The 5 Vice-Presidents have a salary of $90,000.\n5. The 1 President has a salary of $130,000.\n\nNow, since there are 59 salaries, the median will be the salary at the 30th position (since 30 is the middle value when 59 is rounded down to the nearest whole number).\n\nLooking at the list, we see that the first 37 values are $23,000 (from the 37 Administrative Specialists), which covers the first 37 positions.\n\nThe 30th position will be one of these 37 positions, specifically the 30th value, which is still $23,000.\n\nSo, the median value of the 59 salaries is $23,000."
