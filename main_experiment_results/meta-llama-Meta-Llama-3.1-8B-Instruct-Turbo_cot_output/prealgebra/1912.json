    "solution": "Since the arithmetic mean of these expressions is 24, we can write the expression for the mean: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{(x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)}{5}&=24\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad (x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)&=5\\cdot 24\n\\end{align*}\n\nCombining like terms on the left, we find $5x+40=120$, so $5x=80$, from which we have $x=16$. Our final answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $x$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers is the sum of all the numbers divided by the total count of numbers. In this case, we have 5 expressions, and their arithmetic mean is 24.\n\n2. To find the total sum of these expressions, we multiply the arithmetic mean (24) by the total count of numbers (5): $24 \\times 5 = 120$.\n\n3. Now, we need to find the sum of the given expressions: $(x + 8) + 15 + (2x) + 13 + (2x + 4)$.\n\n4. Simplify the expression by combining like terms: \n   $(x + 8) + (2x + 4) + 15 + 13 = x + 2x + (8 + 4) + 15 + 13 = 3x + 40$.\n\n5. Now we have the simplified expression, which is equal to the total sum we calculated earlier (120): $3x + 40 = 120$.\n\n6. To find the value of $x$, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 40 from both sides:\n   $3x = 120 - 40$\n   $3x = 80$\n\n7. Finally, divide both sides by 3 to solve for $x$:\n   $x = 80 / 3$\n   $x = 26.\\overline{6}$"
