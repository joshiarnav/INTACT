    "model_solution": "To find the number of prime numbers between 30 and 50, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, list the numbers between 30 and 50: \n   31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50\n\n2. Next, identify the prime numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. Start with the smallest number in the list and check if it's prime. 31 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 (the prime numbers less than 31). Therefore, 31 is a prime number.\n\n4. Continue checking each number:\n   - 32 is divisible by 2, so it's not prime.\n   - 33 is divisible by 3, so it's not prime.\n   - 34 is divisible by 2, so it's not prime.\n   - 35 is divisible by 5, so it's not prime.\n   - 36 is divisible by 2 and 3, so it's not prime.\n   - 37 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. Therefore, 37 is a prime number.\n   - 38 is divisible by 2, so it's not prime.\n   - 39 is divisible by 3, so it's not prime.\n   - 40 is divisible by 2 and 5, so it's not prime.\n   - 41 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. Therefore, 41 is a prime number.\n   - 42 is divisible by 2 and 3, so it's not prime.\n   - 43 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. Therefore, 43 is a prime number.\n   - 44 is divisible by 2 and 11, so it's not prime.\n   - 45 is divisible by 3 and 5, so it's not prime.\n   - 46 is divisible by 2, so it's not prime.\n   - 47 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. Therefore, 47 is a prime number.\n   - 48 is divisible by 2 and 3, so it's not prime.\n   - 49 is divisible by 7, so it's not prime.\n   - 50 is divisible by 2 and 5, so it's not prime.\n\n5. From the numbers between 30 and 50, we found the following prime numbers:\n   - 31\n   - 37\n   - 41\n   - 43\n   - 47\n\nThere are 5 prime numbers between 30 and 50."
