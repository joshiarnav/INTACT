    "model_solution": "To find the smallest positive number that is prime and $10$ less than a perfect square, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Find perfect squares**: We need to start by listing perfect squares, as we're looking for numbers that are $10$ less than a perfect square. Let's begin with the first few perfect squares:\n   - $1^2 = 1$\n   - $2^2 = 4$\n   - $3^2 = 9$\n   - $4^2 = 16$\n   - $5^2 = 25$\n   - $6^2 = 36$\n   - $7^2 = 49$\n   - $8^2 = 64$\n\n2. **Subtract 10 from perfect squares**: Now, let's subtract $10$ from each of these perfect squares:\n   - $1 - 10 = -9$ (not a positive number, so we can skip this)\n   - $4 - 10 = -6$ (not a positive number, so we can skip this)\n   - $9 - 10 = -1$ (not a positive number, so we can skip this)\n   - $16 - 10 = 6$\n   - $25 - 10 = 15$\n   - $36 - 10 = 26$\n   - $49 - 10 = 39$\n   - $64 - 10 = 54$\n\n3. **Check for prime numbers**: Now, let's check if any of these numbers are prime:\n   - $6$ is not prime (it has divisors $2$ and $3$)\n   - $15$ is not prime (it has divisors $3$ and $5$)\n   - $26$ is not prime (it has divisors $2$ and $13$)\n   - $39$ is not prime (it has divisors $3$ and $13$)\n   - $54$ is not prime (it has divisors $2$, $3$, and $9$)\n\n4. **Find the smallest prime number**: We need to find the smallest prime number from the list. The next perfect square is $9$, and subtracting $10$ gives us $-1$. However, we can try the next perfect square, which is $16$. Subtracting $10$ from it gives us $6$. However, we can check the next one, which is $25$. Subtracting $10$ from it gives us $15$, which is not prime. However, we can check the next one, which is $36$. Subtracting $10$ from it gives us $26$, which is not prime. However, we can check the next one, which is $49$. Subtracting $10$ from it gives us $39$, which is not prime. However, we can check the next one, which is $64$. Subtracting $10$ from it gives us $54$, which is not prime. However, we can check the next one, which is $81$. Subtracting $10$ from it gives us $71$.\n\n5. **The final answer**: The smallest positive number that is prime and $10$ less than a perfect square is $\\boxed{71}$."
