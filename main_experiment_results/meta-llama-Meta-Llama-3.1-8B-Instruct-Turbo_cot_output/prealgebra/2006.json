    "model_solution": "To simplify $\\sqrt{245}$, we'll break it down step by step.\n\n**Step 1:** First, let's try to find perfect square factors of 245. We can start by dividing 245 by perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, etc.) to find any factors that are perfect squares.\n\n**Step 2:** We can start by dividing 245 by 25, but that doesn't work. Then we try dividing it by 16, that also doesn't work. \n\n**Step 3:** Let's try dividing 245 by 4. 245 \u00f7 4 is not a perfect square, but 4 \u00d7 61 = 244 is the closest we get to 245 without going over.\n\n**Step 4:** Let's try dividing 245 by 9. That doesn't work.\n\n**Step 5:** Let's try dividing 245 by 4 again and then try 61 and the square root of the remaining amount.\n\n**Step 6:** Since 245 \u00f7 4 is not a perfect square, let's rewrite 245 as a product of 4 and another number (61) as we tried earlier.\n\n**Step 7:** We can rewrite 245 as 4 * 61. \n\n**Step 8:** Now, let's look at the square root of 245 as the square root of 4 * 61.\n\n**Step 9:** Using a property of square roots (the square root of a product is the product of the square roots), we can rewrite the square root of 4 * 61 as the square root of 4 times the square root of 61.\n\n**Step 10:** The square root of 4 is 2 (because 2 * 2 = 4), and the square root of 61 is the square root of 61 (because it's not a perfect square).\n\n**Step 11:** Therefore, $\\sqrt{245} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 61} = 2\\sqrt{61}$.\n\nSo, the simplified form of $\\sqrt{245}$ is $2\\sqrt{61}$."
