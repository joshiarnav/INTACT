    "problem": "What is the greatest common multiple of 8 and 12 that is less than 90?",
    "solution": "Recall that the common multiples of a set of integers are precisely the multiples of the least common multiple of the set. In this case, the common multiples are integers of the form $24k$ (where $k$ is an integer), since 24 is the least common multiple of 8 and 12. Since $24(3)=72$ and $24(4)=96>90$, the greatest common multiple of 8 and 12 less than 90 is $\\boxed{72}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the greatest common multiple of 8 and 12 that is less than 90, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the multiples of 8 and 12**: \n   The multiples of 8 are: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, ...\n   The multiples of 12 are: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, ...\n\n2. **Identify the common multiples**: \n   The numbers that appear in both lists are the common multiples of 8 and 12. In this case, the common multiples are: 24, 48, 72.\n\n3. **Find the greatest common multiple that is less than 90**:\n   From the list of common multiples, we can see that the greatest number that is less than 90 is 72.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common multiple of 8 and 12 that is less than 90 is **72**."
