    "problem": "A toy store manager received a large order of Mr. Slinkums just in time for the holidays. The manager places $20\\%$ of them on the shelves, leaving the other 120 Mr. Slinkums in storage. How many Mr. Slinkums were in this order?",
    "solution": "If $20\\%$ of the toys were put on the shelves, the $80\\%$ of the toys were left in storage.  Therefore, we are given $80\\% T=120$, where $T$ is the number of toys in the order.  Rewriting $80\\%$ as $\\frac{4}{5}$ and multiplying both sides by $\\frac{5}{4}$, we find that $T=120\\cdot\\frac{5}{4}=30\\cdot 5=\\boxed{150}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1.  The manager places $20\\%$ of the Mr. Slinkums on the shelves, which means $80\\%$ of the Mr. Slinkums are left in storage.\n2.  We are told that the number of Mr. Slinkums in storage is $120$. This represents $80\\%$ of the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order.\n3.  To find the total number of Mr. Slinkums, we need to set up an equation based on the information above.\n4.  Let $x$ be the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order.\n5.  We know that $80\\%$ of $x$ is $120$. So, we can write the equation as $0.8x = 120$.\n6.  To solve for $x$, we can subtract $0.8x$ from both sides of the equation and then divide both sides by $0.8$.\n7.  This gives us $x = \\frac{120}{0.8}$.\n8.  Solving this, we get $x = 150$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order is $150$."
