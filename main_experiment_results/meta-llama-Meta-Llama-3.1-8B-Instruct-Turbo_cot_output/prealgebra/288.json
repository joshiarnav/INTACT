    "solution": "The two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7; the largest two-digit prime is 97 (98 and 99 are both composite).  The product of these three primes is $5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 97 = 35 \\cdot 97 = 35(100-3)=3500-105=\\boxed{3395}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to identify the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime.\n\n1. One-digit primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7.\n\n2. Now, we need to find the largest two-digit prime. Two-digit primes are numbers between 10 and 99 that are prime. We can start by listing some of them:\n   11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.\n\n3. The largest two-digit prime is 97.\n\n4. Now, we can find the product of 5, 7, and 97:\n   Product = 5 * 7 * 97\n   Product = 35 * 97\n   Product = 3395.\n\nTherefore, the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime is 3395."
