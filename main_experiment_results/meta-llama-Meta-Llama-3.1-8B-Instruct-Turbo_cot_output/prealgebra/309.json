    "problem": "In a history class, the probability of earning an A is .7 times the probability of earning a B, and the probability of earning a C is 1.4 times the probability of earning a B. Assuming that all grades are A, B, or C, how many B's will there be in a history class of 31 students?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of students who earn a B. Then we know that the number of students who get an A is $.7x$ and the number of students who earn a C is $1.4x$. Since every student in the class gets an A, B, or C and there are 31 students, this gives us the equation $.7x + x + 1.4x = 31 \\Rightarrow 3.1x = 31 \\Rightarrow x =\\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of B's in the class, we need to first determine the probability of each grade. Let's assume the probability of earning a B is x. \n\nGiven that the probability of earning an A is .7 times the probability of earning a B, \nthe probability of earning an A is 0.7x.\n\nGiven that the probability of earning a C is 1.4 times the probability of earning a B, \nthe probability of earning a C is 1.4x.\n\nSince all grades are A, B, or C, the sum of the probabilities of A, B, and C must equal 1.\nSo, we can set up the equation: \n0.7x + x + 1.4x = 1\n\nCombining like terms, we get: \n3.1x = 1\n\nDividing both sides by 3.1, we get: \nx = 1 / 3.1\nx = 0.3226\n\nThis means the probability of earning a B is approximately 0.3226 or 32.26%. \n\nTo find the expected number of B's in the class, we can multiply the probability of earning a B by the total number of students:\n0.3226 * 31 \u2248 10.0006\n\nSo, there will be approximately 10 B's in the class."
