    "model_solution": "To find the percentage of sales that were not pens or pencils, we first need to find the total percentage of sales that were pens and pencils.\n\nGiven:\n- Pens: 38\\% of sales\n- Pencils: 35\\% of sales\n\nThe total percentage of sales that were pens and pencils can be found by adding the individual percentages:\n38\\% + 35\\% = 73\\%\n\nThis means that 73\\% of the sales were pens and pencils. To find the percentage of sales that were not pens or pencils, we can subtract this value from 100\\%:\n100\\% - 73\\% = 27\\%\n\nTherefore, 27\\% of its sales were not pens or pencils."
