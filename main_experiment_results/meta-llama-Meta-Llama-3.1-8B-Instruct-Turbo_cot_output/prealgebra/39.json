    "problem": "In pentagon $MATHS$, $\\angle M \\cong \\angle T \\cong \\angle H$ and $\\angle A$ is supplementary to $\\angle S$. How many degrees are in the measure of $\\angle H$?",
    "solution": "The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so we must have \\[\\angle M + \\angle A + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle S = 540^\\circ.\\] Since $\\angle A$ and $\\angle S$ are supplementary, we have $\\angle A +\\angle S = 180^\\circ$.  Combining this with $\\angle H = \\angle M = \\angle T$, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\angle M + \\angle A + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle S& =\n(\\angle M + \\angle T + \\angle H) \\\\\n&\\qquad+ (\\angle A +\\angle S) \\\\\n&= 3\\angle H + 180^\\circ,\\end{align*} so $3\\angle H + 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ$.  Therefore, $3\\angle H = 360^\\circ$ and $\\angle H = \\boxed{120^\\circ}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the measure of angle H, let's first recall that the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula (n-2) * 180 degrees, where n is the number of sides of the polygon.\n\nFor a pentagon, n = 5, so the sum of the interior angles is (5-2) * 180 = 3 * 180 = 540 degrees.\n\nSince we are given that angles M, T, and H are congruent, we can let m = M = T = H. \n\nWe are also given that angle A is supplementary to angle S, which means that their sum is 180 degrees. Let's call the measure of angle A x. Then, the measure of angle S is (180 - x) degrees.\n\nNow, we can set up the equation: m + m + m + x + (180 - x) = 540.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get 3m + 180 = 540.\n\nSubtracting 180 from both sides gives us 3m = 360.\n\nDividing both sides by 3 gives us m = 120.\n\nTherefore, the measure of angle H is 120 degrees."
