    "solution": "A circle's radius is half its diameter, so if the diameter of a circle is 4 meters, then its radius is 2 meters.  The area of the circle is $\\pi(\\text{radius})^2=\\pi(2\\text{ m})^2=\\boxed{4\\pi}$ square meters.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the circle, we first need to find the radius of the circle. \n\nThe radius of a circle is half of its diameter. \nGiven diameter = 4 meters, \nradius = diameter / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 meters.\n\nNow, we can use the formula to find the area of the circle. \nThe formula for the area of a circle is given by: \nArea = \u03c0 * r^2 \nwhere r is the radius of the circle.\n\nSubstituting the value of radius (r = 2 meters) in the formula, \nArea = \u03c0 * 2^2\nArea = \u03c0 * 4\n\nSo, the area of the circle with diameter 4 meters is 4\u03c0 square meters."
