    "problem": "Piravena must make a trip from $A$ to $B$, then from $B$ to $C$, then from $C$ to $A$.  Each of these three parts of the trip is made entirely by bus or entirely by airplane.  The cities form a right-angled triangle as shown, with $C$ a distance of 3000 km from $A$ and with $B$ a distance of 3250 km from $A$. To take a bus, it costs Piravena $\\$0.15$ per kilometer. To take an airplane, it costs her a $\\$100$ booking fee, plus $\\$0.10$ per kilometer.

    "solution": "Since $\\triangle ABC$ is a right-angled triangle, then we may use the Pythagorean Theorem.\nThus, $AB^2=BC^2+CA^2$, and so  \\begin{align*}\nBC^2&=AB^2-CA^2\\\\\n&=3250^2-3000^2\\\\\n&=250^2(13^2-12^2)\\\\\n&=250^2(5^2)\\\\\n&=1250^2.\n\\end{align*} therefore $BC=1250$ km (since $BC>0$).\nPiravena travels a distance of $3250+1250+3000=\\boxed{7500}$ km for her complete trip.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total distance Piravena travels, we need to find the distance of each part of the trip and add them up.\n\n1. The distance from $A$ to $B$ is given as 3250 km.\n\n2. The distance from $B$ to $C$ can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\n   In this case, the distance from $A$ to $C$ is 3000 km, and the distance from $A$ to $B$ is 3250 km. Therefore, the distance from $B$ to $C$ can be found as follows:\n   \\begin{align*}\n   BC^2 &amp;= AB^2 - AC^2\\\\\n   &amp;= 3250^2 - 3000^2\\\\\n   &amp;= 10,562,500 - 9,000,000\\\\\n   &amp;= 1562,500\\\\\n   \\Rightarrow\\qquad BC &amp;= \\sqrt{1562,500}\\\\\n   &amp;= 1250 \\text{ km}\n   \\end{align*}\n\n3. The distance from $C$ to $A$ is given as 3000 km.\n\nNow, we can find the total distance Piravena travels by adding up the distances of each part of the trip:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Total distance} &amp;= AB + BC + CA\\\\\n&amp;= 3250 + 1250 + 3000\\\\\n&amp;= 7500 \\text{ km}\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, Piravena travels a total distance of 7500 km for her complete trip."
