Now, let's simplify the innermost expression: $1-x$\n   This is already simplified, so we move to the next step.\n\n3. Now, let's add 1 to the inner expression: $1+(1-x)$\n   This simplifies to: $2-x$\n\n4. Now, let's subtract the expression obtained in step 3 from 1: $1-(2-x)$\n   This simplifies to: $-1+x$ or $x-1$\n\n5. Now, let's add 1 to the expression obtained in step 4: $1+(x-1)$\n   This simplifies to: $x$\n\n6. Now, let's add 1 to the expression obtained in step 5: $1+(x)$\n   This simplifies to: $1+x$\n\n7. Now, let's subtract the expression obtained in step 6 from 1: $1-(1+x)$\n   This simplifies to: $-x$"
