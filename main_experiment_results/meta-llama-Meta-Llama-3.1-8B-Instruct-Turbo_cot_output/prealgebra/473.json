    "problem": "Round to the nearest hundredth: 18.4851",
    "solution": "To round $18.4851$ to the nearest hundredth, we must look at the hundreds and the thousands digits of the number in question. Since the thousands digit ($5$) is greater than or equal to $5$, the hundreds digit $8$ rounds up to $9$. Therefore, $18.4851$ rounded to the nearest hundredth is equal to $\\boxed{18.49}$.",

    "model_solution": "To round 18.4851 to the nearest hundredth, we'll look at the digit 5, which is in the thousandths place. \n\nStep 1: The digit in the hundredths place is 8. \nStep 2: The digit to the nearest hundredth is 4, which is in the thousandths place. Since 4 is less than 5, we'll round down. \n\nWhen rounding down, we look at the digit in the hundredths place (8) and keep it the same. The digit in the thousandths place (4) will become 0.\n\nSo, 18.4851 rounded to the nearest hundredth is 18.49."
