    "problem": "The circular region of the sign (below, left) has an area of 154 square inches. Vanessa would like to place a tiny ribbon (shaded) around the circle's edge. To be sure she has enough ribbon, she decides to buy 2 inches more of the ribbon than the original circle's circumference.

    "solution": "Say the radius of the circle is $r$. Then the area of the circle is $\\pi r^2,$ which we estimate to $154=\\frac{22}{7}r^2$. If we multiply both sides by $\\frac{7}{22}$, we get $r^2=49$ or $r=7$. The circle's circumference is $2\\pi r$, which we again estimate to $\\frac{44}{7}r=44$. Vanessa wants two extra inches of ribbon, so she needs to buy $44+2=\\boxed{46}$ inches of ribbon.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the original radius of the circle using the estimated value of pi.\n2. Find the original circumference of the circle using the radius found in step 1.\n3. Add 2 inches to the circumference found in step 2 to find the total inches of ribbon Vanessa needs.\n\nStep 1: Find the original radius of the circle. \nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = pi * r^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. We're given that A = 154 square inches and we'll use the estimated value of pi (22/7). \n\nTo find the radius, we'll rearrange the formula to solve for r:\n\nr^2 = A / (pi)\nr^2 = 154 / (22/7)\nr^2 = 154 * (7 / 22)\nr^2 = 49\nr = \u221a49\nr = 7\n\nStep 2: Find the original circumference of the circle using the radius found in step 1. \nThe formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2 * pi * r.\n\nUsing the radius found in step 1 (r = 7) and the estimated value of pi (22/7), we'll find the circumference:\n\nC = 2 * (22/7) * 7\nC = 2 * 22\nC = 44\n\nStep 3: Add 2 inches to the circumference found in step 2 to find the total inches of ribbon Vanessa needs.\nVanessa wants to buy 2 inches more of the ribbon than the original circle's circumference, so we'll add 2 inches to the circumference found in step 2:\n\nTotal inches = C + 2\nTotal inches = 44 + 2\nTotal inches = 46\n\nVanessa needs to buy 46 inches of ribbon."
