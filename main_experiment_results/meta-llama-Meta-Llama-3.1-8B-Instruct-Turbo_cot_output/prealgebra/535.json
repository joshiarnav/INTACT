    "problem": "We have a cube with 4 blue faces and 2 red faces.  What's the probability that when it is rolled, a blue face will be facing up?",
    "solution": "We have 6 equally likely outcomes, corresponding to the 6 faces of the cube.  4 of those 6 outcomes are successful ones (meaning a blue face is facing up).  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability of a blue face facing up when the cube is rolled, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of faces**: A cube has 6 faces.\n2. **Determine the number of blue faces**: You mentioned there are 4 blue faces.\n3. **Determine the number of red faces**: You mentioned there are 2 red faces.\n4. **Calculate the probability**: The probability of a blue face facing up is the number of blue faces divided by the total number of faces.\n\nUsing the information above:\n\n- Total number of faces: 6\n- Number of blue faces: 4\n- Number of red faces: 2\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of blue faces) / (Total number of faces)\n= 4 / 6\n= 2 / 3\n\nSo, the probability of a blue face facing up when the cube is rolled is 2/3 or approximately 66.67%."
