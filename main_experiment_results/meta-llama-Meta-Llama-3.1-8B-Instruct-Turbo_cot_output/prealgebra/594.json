    "problem": "What is the sum of the prime factors of 91?",
    "solution": "Since 91 is not divisible by the first three prime numbers, we try dividing $91\\div 7$.  We find a quotient of 13, so $91=7\\times 13$ and the sum of these prime factors is $7+13=\\boxed{20}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the prime factors of 91, we'll first need to find the prime factors.\n\nStep 1: Check if 91 is divisible by the smallest prime number, 2. \n91 is not divisible by 2 (91 \u00f7 2 = 45.5).\n\nStep 2: Check if 91 is divisible by 3. \n91 \u00f7 3 = 30.333 (it's not a whole number).\n\nStep 3: Check if 91 is divisible by 5. \n91 \u00f7 5 = 18.2 (it's not a whole number).\n\nStep 4: Check if 91 is divisible by 7. \n91 \u00f7 7 = 13 (it's a whole number).\n\nSo, 91 is divisible by 7, which is a prime number.\n\nStep 5: Check if 13 is divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. \n13 is a prime number itself and not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\nStep 6: The prime factors of 91 are 7 and 13.\n\nStep 7: Find the sum of the prime factors. \n7 + 13 = 20.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the prime factors of 91 is 20."
