    "solution": "First, let's calculate the area of the plot of land in cm. Then, we'll convert as the questions ask.\n\nRecall the formula for the area of a trapezoid is given by $\\mbox{Area} = (\\mbox{bottom} + \\mbox{ top})\\times \\mbox{height} \\times \\frac{1}{2}$, so the area of this trapezoid is $$(10 \\mbox{cm} + 15 \\mbox{cm}) \\times 10 \\mbox{cm} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 125 \\mbox{cm}^2.$$Now, we are given that $1 \\mbox{ cm } = 2 \\mbox{ miles }$. Squaring both sides, that means $$1 \\mbox{ cm}^2 = 4 \\mbox{ miles}^2.$$We are told that $1 \\mbox{ miles}^2 = 640 \\mbox{ acres}$, so the above equation is actually:\n\n$$1 \\mbox{ cm}^2 = 4 \\mbox{ miles}^2 \\times \\frac{ 640 \\mbox{ acres}}{1 \\mbox{ miles}^2} = 2560 \\mbox{ acres}.$$Finally, we can convert $$125 \\mbox{ cm}^2 \\times \\frac{ 2560 \\mbox{ acres}}{1 \\mbox{ cm}^2} = \\boxed{320000 \\mbox{ acres}}.$$",

    "model_solution": "To find the size of the actual plot of land in acres, we need to first find its area in square centimeters using the given scale, and then convert it to square miles, and finally acres.\n\nStep 1: Find the area of the plot in square centimeters.\nThe plot of land can be divided into two triangles and a rectangle. \n\n- The first triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 10 cm.\n- The second triangle has a base of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm.\n- The rectangle has a length of 15 cm and a width of 10 cm.\n\nNow, we can calculate their areas:\n- The area of the first triangle = (base \u00d7 height) / 2 = (10 \u00d7 10) / 2 = 50 square cm.\n- The area of the second triangle = (base \u00d7 height) / 2 = (5 \u00d7 10) / 2 = 25 square cm.\n- The area of the rectangle = base \u00d7 height = 15 \u00d7 10 = 150 square cm.\n\nAdding these areas together, we get the total area of the plot in square centimeters:\n50 + 25 + 150 = 225 square cm.\n\nStep 2: Convert the area of the plot from square centimeters to square miles.\nGiven that 1 cm equals 2 miles, 1 square centimeter equals 4 square miles (2 miles per side).\nSo, we can convert the area of the plot from square centimeters to square miles by multiplying the area in square centimeters by 4:\n225 square cm \u00d7 4 = 900 square miles.\n\nStep 3: Convert the area of the plot from square miles to acres.\nWe are given that one square mile is equal to 640 acres.\nTo find the area of the plot in acres, we can multiply the area of the plot in square miles by 640:\n900 square miles \u00d7 640 = 576,000 acres.\n\nTherefore, the actual plot of land is 576,000 acres."
