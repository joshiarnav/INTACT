    "problem": "The average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $4x-7$. What is $x$?",
    "solution": "The average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $\\dfrac{1}{3}((x+6)+(6x+2)+(2x+7))$. Simplifying this expression gives $\\dfrac{1}{3}(9x+15)=3x+5$. We know the average is also $4x-7$, so $3x+5=4x-7$. Subtracting $3x-7$ from both sides of this equation gives $x=\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $x$, we need to find the average of the three expressions $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ and then set it equal to $4x-7$.\n\nFirst, let's find the average of the three expressions:\n\nAverage = (($x+6$) + ($6x+2$) + ($2x+7$)) / 3\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\nAverage = (($x + 6x + 2x$) + ($6 + 2 + 7$)) / 3\nAverage = ($9x + 15$) / 3\n\nNext, we need to set the average equal to $4x-7$:\n\n($9x + 15$) / 3 = $4x - 7$\n\nNow, let's multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n$9x + 15 = 3(4x - 7)$\n\nNext, let's distribute the 3 to the terms inside the parentheses:\n\n$9x + 15 = 12x - 21$\n\nNow, let's isolate the variable $x$ by moving all the terms with $x$ to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side:\n\n$9x - 12x = -21 - 15$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$-3x = -36$\n\nNow, let's divide both sides of the equation by -3 to solve for $x$:\n\n$x = 36 / 3$\n\n$x = 12$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ is 12."
