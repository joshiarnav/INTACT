    "problem": "Amanda, Ben, and Carlos share a sum of money. Their portions are in the ratio of 1:2:7, respectively. If Amanda's portion is $\\$$20, what is the total amount of money shared?",
    "solution": "We multiply each part of the ratio $1:2:7$ by 20 to make Amanda's part equal 20, and we have \\[1:2:7 = 1\\cdot 20:2\\cdot 20 :7\\cdot 20 = 20:40:140.\\] This means that  Ben's share is $2\\times 20 = 40$ dollars and Carlos's share is $7\\times 20=140$ dollars.  Therefore, the total amount of money shared is $20+40+140=\\boxed{200}$ dollars.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total amount of money shared, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. We are given that the portions of Amanda, Ben, and Carlos are in the ratio 1:2:7. This means that if Amanda's portion is 1x, Ben's portion is 2x, and Carlos's portion is 7x.\n\n2. We are given that Amanda's portion is $\\$$20. Since Amanda's portion is represented as 1x, we can set up the equation 1x = $\\$$20. \n\n3. Solving the equation 1x = $\\$$20, we get x = $\\$$20.\n\n4. Now that we know x, we can find the portions of Ben and Carlos. Ben's portion is 2x, so Ben's portion is 2 * $\\$$20 = $\\$$40. Carlos's portion is 7x, so Carlos's portion is 7 * $\\$$20 = $\\$$140.\n\n5. To find the total amount of money shared, we need to add up the portions of Amanda, Ben, and Carlos. The total amount is $\\$$20 + $\\$$40 + $\\$$140.\n\n6. Adding the portions together, we get the total amount of money shared: $\\$$20 + $\\$$40 + $\\$$140 = $\\$$200.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money shared is $\\$$200."
