    "problem": "If $x$ is a positive multiple of 8 and $x^2>100$, but $x<20$, what is $x$?",
    "solution": "This question gives multiple clues on what $x$ could be. Because $x^2>100$, we know that $x$ must be greater than 10, but $x$ is also less than 20. So $x$ is a multiple of 8 that is between 10 and 20. The only value that fits this description is $\\boxed{16}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: We're given that $x^2>100$. This means $x$ must be greater than 10 or less than -10. However, we also know that $x$ is a positive multiple of 8, so we can ignore the negative solution.\n\nStep 2: Since $x$ is a positive multiple of 8, we can list the possible values of $x$: 8, 16, 24, 32, ...\n\nStep 3: We're also given that $x<20$. This means we can only consider the values of $x$ that are less than 20. From our list in step 2, we can see that 8, 16, and 24 are the only multiples of 8 less than 20.\n\nStep 4: Now we need to find the value of $x$ that satisfies $x^2>100$. We can test the values from step 3:\n\n- $8^2=64$, which is less than 100.\n- $16^2=256$, which is greater than 100.\n\nStep 5: From step 4, we can see that the only value of $x$ that satisfies both $x^2>100$ and $x<20$ is $x=16$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{16}$."
