    "problem": "A square 10cm on each side has four quarter circles drawn with centers at the four corners. How many square centimeters are in the area of the shaded region? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize (1.5 cm);\n\ndraw((-1,-1)--(1,-1)--(1,1)--(-1,1)--cycle);\nfilldraw(arc((1,1),1,270,180)--arc((-1,1),1,360,270)--arc((-1,-1),1,90,0)--arc((1,-1),1,180,90)--cycle,gray);\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "We first notice that the area of the shaded region is the area of the square minus the areas of the four quarter circles. Each quarter circle has a radius half the side length, so if we sum the areas of the four quarter circles, we have the area of one full circle with radius $5$ cm. Now, we know the area of a square is the square of its side length, so the square has an area of $100 \\text{ cm}^2$. A circle has an area of $\\pi$ times its radius squared, so the four quarter circles combined have an area of $\\pi(5)^2=25\\pi \\text{ cm}^2$. From this, we know that the area of the shaded region is $\\boxed{100-25\\pi} \\text{ cm}^2$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the shaded region, we need to find the total area of the square and subtract the areas of the four quarter circles from it.\n\nStep 1: Find the area of the square.\nThe area of the square is given by the formula $side^2$. Since the side length of the square is 10 cm, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$ square centimeters.\n\nStep 2: Find the area of the quarter circles.\nThe area of each quarter circle can be found by using the formula for the area of a circle, which is $\\pi r^2$, and then dividing by 4. Since the radius of each quarter circle is half the side length of the square (i.e., 5 cm), the area of each quarter circle is $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi 5^2 = \\frac{25}{4}\\pi$. \n\nStep 3: Find the total area of the four quarter circles.\nSince there are four quarter circles, the total area of the quarter circles is $4 \\cdot \\frac{25}{4}\\pi = 25\\pi$ square centimeters.\n\nStep 4: Find the area of the shaded region.\nNow, we can subtract the total area of the quarter circles from the area of the square to find the area of the shaded region: \n$100 - 25\\pi$."
