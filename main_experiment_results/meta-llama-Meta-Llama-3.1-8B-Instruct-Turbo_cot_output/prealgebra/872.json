    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the greatest common factor (GCF) of 3 and 6, and the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 6, we need to follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Find the factors of 3 and 6\n- Factors of 3: 1, 3\n- Factors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6\n\nStep 2: Identify the greatest common factor (GCF) of 3 and 6\n- The largest number that appears in both lists of factors is 3. So, the GCF is 3.\n\nStep 3: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 6\n- The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 3 and 6. Since 6 is a multiple of 3, the LCM is 6.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the sum of the GCF and LCM\n- GCF = 3\n- LCM = 6\n- Sum = GCF + LCM = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nTherefore, the sum of the greatest common factor of 3 and 6 and the least common multiple of 3 and 6 is 9."
