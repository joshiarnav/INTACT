Since $AC = 2\\sqrt{3}$, we have $BC = 2$.  Therefore, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is  \\[\\frac{(AC)(BC)}{2} = \\frac{(2\\sqrt{3})(2)}{2} = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{3}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of $\\Delta ABC$, we can first find the area of $\\Delta ACD$ and then add it to the area of $\\Delta BCD$ to get the total area of $\\Delta ABC$.\n\nStep 1: Find the area of $\\Delta ACD$. Since $CD = \\sqrt3$ and it's given that angle $ACD$ is a right angle, this makes $\\Delta ACD$ a 30-60-90 triangle. In such triangles, the ratio of side lengths is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$. Therefore, the length of $AC$ is $2CD = 2\\sqrt3$ and the length of $AD$ is $CD = \\sqrt3$.\n\nThe area of a triangle is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\times base \\times height$. Here, the height is $AD = \\sqrt3$ and the base is $CD = \\sqrt3$. So the area of $\\Delta ACD$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt3 \\times \\sqrt3 = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nStep 2: Find the area of $\\Delta BCD$. We already know that $BC = \\sqrt3$, and to find the area of $\\Delta BCD$, we need to find its base and height. Since $BC$ is the hypotenuse of $\\Delta BCD$, its length is $\\sqrt3$. From the above diagram, observe the properties of 45-45-90 triangles. Here, $BD = DC = \\sqrt3$. This gives the base of $\\Delta BCD$ as $BC = \\sqrt3$ and the height of $\\Delta BCD$ as $BD = \\sqrt3$. \n\nThus, the area of $\\Delta BCD$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt3 \\times \\sqrt3 = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nStep 3: Find the area of $\\Delta ABC$. The area of $\\Delta ABC$ is the sum of the areas of $\\Delta ACD$ and $\\Delta BCD$. Therefore, the area of $\\Delta ABC$ is $\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$ square centimeters.\n\nTherefore, the area of $\\Delta ABC$ is $3$ square centimeters."
