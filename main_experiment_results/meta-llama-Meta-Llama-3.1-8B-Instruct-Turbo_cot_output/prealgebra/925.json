    "problem": "A number in the set $\\{50, 51, 52, 53, ... , 999\\}$ is randomly selected. What is the probability that it is a two-digit number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "To count the number of numbers in this set, we subtract 49 from all of the numbers, giving the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 950 \\}$, making it obvious that there are 950 numbers total. Furthermore, the set $\\{ 50, 51, 52, \\ldots, 98, 99 \\}$ corresponds to the more easily counted $\\{ 1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 49, 50 \\}$ by subtracting 49. So, the probability of selecting a two-digit number is $\\frac{50}{950} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability of selecting a two-digit number from the given set, we first need to determine the total number of numbers in the set and the number of two-digit numbers within it.\n\n1. **Total number of numbers in the set**: The set starts from 50 and ends at 999. So, we need to find the count of numbers from 50 to 999.\n   There are 999 - 50 + 1 = 950 numbers in the set.\n\n2. **Number of two-digit numbers in the set**: Two-digit numbers in the set range from 50 to 99. So, we need to find the count of numbers from 50 to 99.\n   There are 99 - 50 + 1 = 50 numbers in the set that are two-digit numbers.\n\n3. **Probability of selecting a two-digit number**: To find the probability of selecting a two-digit number from the set, we divide the number of two-digit numbers by the total number of numbers in the set.\n   Probability = Number of two-digit numbers / Total number of numbers\n               = 50 / 950\n               = 1 / 19\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a two-digit number from the given set is 1/19."
