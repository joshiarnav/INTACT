    "problem": "A certain regular tetrahedron has three of its vertices at the points $(0,1,2),$ $(4,2,1),$ and $(3,1,5).$  Find the coordinates of the fourth vertex, given that they are also all integers.",
    "solution": "The side length of the regular tetrahedron is the distance between $(0,1,2)$ and $(4,2,1),$ which is\n\\[\\sqrt{(0 - 4)^2 + (1 - 2)^2 + (2 - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{18} = 3 \\sqrt{2}.\\]So if $(x,y,z)$ is the fourth vertex, with integer coordinates, then\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 2)^2 &= 18, \\\\\n(x - 4)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + (z - 1)^2 &= 18, \\\\\n(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 5)^2 &= 18.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting the first and third equations, we get $6x + 6z - 30 = 0$, so $x + z = 5,$ which means $z = 5 - x.$  Subtracting the first and second equation, we get $8x + 2y - 2z - 16 = 0,$ so\n\\[y = z - 4x + 8 = (5 - x) - 4x + 8 = 13 - 5x.\\]Substituting into the first equation, we get\n\\[x^2 + (12 - 5x)^2 + (3 - x)^2 = 18.\\]This simplifies to $27x^2 - 126x + 135 = 0,$ which factors as $9(x - 3)(3x - 5) = 0.$  Since $x$ is an integer, $x = 3.$  Then $y = -2$ and $z = 2.$  Thus, the fourth vertex is $\\boxed{(3,-2,2)}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex, we first need to find the equation of the plane that contains the three given vertices. The equation of a plane can be written in the form:\n\nax + by + cz + d = 0\n\nSince the three given vertices lie on the plane, we can plug in their coordinates to get three equations:\n\na(0) + b(1) + c(2) + d = 0\na(4) + b(2) + c(1) + d = 0\na(3) + b(1) + c(5) + d = 0\n\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\n\nb + 2c + d = 0\n4a + 2b + c + d = 0\n3a + b + 5c + d = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the values of a, b, c, and d that satisfy these equations. We can start by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate d. This gives us:\n\n3a + b + c = 0\n\nNext, we can subtract the first equation from the third equation to get:\n\n3a - b + 3c = 0\n\nNow, we have two equations with three variables. We can solve for b and c in terms of a:\n\nb = -3a - 3c\nc = -a + b\n\nSubstituting these expressions into one of the original equations, we can solve for a, b, and c. Let's use the first equation:\n\nb + 2c + d = 0\n\nSubstituting b = -3a - 3c and c = -a + b into this equation, we get:\n\n-3a - 3(-a + b) + 2(-a + b) + d = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n-3a + 3a - 3b - 2a + 2b + d = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-d + b = 0\n\nSubstituting b = -3a - 3c and c = -a + b into this equation again, we get:\n\n-d + (-3a - 3(-a + b)) = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n-d - 3a + 3b + 3a - 3b = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-d = 0\n\nd = 0\n\nNow, substitute d = 0 into one of the original equations, say b + 2c + d = 0. We get:\n\nb + 2c = 0\n\nb = -2c\n\nNow that we have b and c in terms of a single variable, we can substitute these expressions into one of the original equations to solve for a. Let's use the first equation:\n\nb + 2c + d = 0\n\nSubstituting b = -2c and d = 0 into this equation, we get:\n\n-2c + 2c + 0 = 0\n\nThis equation is true for any value of c, so we can choose any value of c that we like. Let's choose c = 1, for example. Then b = -2c = -2.\n\nNow, we can substitute b = -2 and c = 1 into one of the original equations to solve for a. Let's use the first equation:\n\nb + 2c + d = 0\n\nSubstituting b = -2, c = 1, and d = 0 into this equation, we get:\n\n-2 + 2 + 0 = 0\n\nThis equation is true, so we have found a solution for a, b, and c.\n\nNow that we have the values of a, b, and c, we can write the equation of the plane:\n\n0x - 2y + z + 0 = 0\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n-2y + z = 0\n\nz = 2y\n\nNow, we can plug in the coordinates of the three given vertices to find the corresponding values of y. Let's use the first vertex, for example:\n\n(0,1,2)\n\nSubstituting y = 1 into z = 2y, we get:\n\nz = 2(1) = 2\n\nSo the first vertex lies on the plane z = 2y.\n\nSimilarly, we can plug in the coordinates of the second and third vertices to find the corresponding values of y. Let's use the second vertex, for example:\n\n(4,2,1)\n\nSubstituting y = 2 into z = 2y, we get:\n\nz = 2(2) = 4\n\nSo the second vertex does not lie on the plane z = 2y.\n\nNow, let's use the third vertex, for example:\n\n(3,1,5)\n\nSubstituting y = 1 into z = 2y, we get:\n\nz = 2(1) = 2\n\nSo the third vertex lies on the plane z = 2y.\n\nSince the first and third vertices lie on the plane z = 2y, and the second vertex does not lie on the plane, we can conclude that the fourth vertex must lie on the plane z = 2y.\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates of the fourth vertex. Since the fourth vertex lies on the plane z = 2y, we can write the z-coordinate as z = 2y. Let's choose y = 1, for example, so that z = 2(1) = 2.\n\nThe distance between the first vertex (0,1,2) and the fourth vertex must equal the distance between the second vertex (4,2,1) and the fourth vertex. This means that the fourth vertex must be equidistant from the first and second vertices.\n\nUsing the distance formula, we can write the equation:\n\n\u221a((0 - x)^2 + (1 - y)^2 + (2 - z)^2) = \u221a((4 - x)^2 + (2 - y)^2 + (1 - z)^2)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx^2 + 0 - 2x + 1 + y^2 - 2y + 4 - z^2 + 4z - 4 = x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2 - 4y + 4 + z^2 - 2z + 1\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-2x + 1 + y^2 - 2y + 4 - z^2 + 4z - 4 = -8x + 16 + y^2 - 4y + 4 + z^2 - 2z + 1\n\n-2x + y^2 - 2y + 4 - z^2 + 4z - 4 = -8x + y^2 - 16 - 4y + 4 + z^2 - 2z + 1\n\n-2x - 8x + y^2 - y^2 + z^2 - z^2 - 4z + 4z - 4 + 4 = -16 - 16\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-10x + 0 + 0 + 0 - 4z + 0 = -32\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n-10x - 4z + 0 = -32\n\nSubtract 0 from both sides:\n\n-10x - 4z = -32\n\nAdd 4z to both sides:\n\n-10x = -4z - 32\n\nDivide both sides by -10:\n\nx = 4z + 32 / 10\n\nx = 4z + 32 / 10\n\nx = 2z + 16 / 5\n\nNow, substitute z = 2y into this equation:\n\nx = 2(2y) + 16 / 5\n\nx = 4y + 16 / 5\n\nNow, substitute y = 1 into this equation to find the x-coordinate of the fourth vertex:\n\nx = 4(1) + 16 / 5\n\nx = 4 + 16 / 5\n\nx = 20 / 5 + 16 / 5\n\nx = 36 / 5\n\nSo the x-coordinate of the fourth vertex is 36/5.\n\nNow, let's choose y = 2, for example, so that z = 2(2) = 4.\n\nSubstitute z = 4 into x = 2z + 16 / 5:\n\nx = 2(4) + 16 / 5\n\nx = 8 + 16 / 5\n\nx = 8 + 32 / 5\n\nx = 40 / 5 + 32 / 5\n\nx = 72 / 5\n\nSo the x-coordinate of the fourth vertex is 72/5.\n\nNow, let's check if the fourth vertex (72/5, 2, 4) lies on the plane z = 2y. Substituting y = 2 into z = 2y, we get:\n\nz = 2(2) = 4\n\nSo the fourth vertex (72/5, 2, 4) lies on the plane z = 2y.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for integer coordinates, we should look for integers that satisfy the distance requirement. We can check the coordinates (4, 2, 4), since they satisfy the equation z = 2y and have integer coordinates. \n\nThe distance between (4, 2, 1) and ("
