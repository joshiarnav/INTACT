    "model_solution": "To find the number of x-intercepts on the graph of $y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x}$ in the interval $(0.0001, 0.001)$, we first need to understand where x-intercepts occur.\n\nThe x-intercepts occur where $\\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0$. This is true if and only if $\\frac{1}{x} = k\\pi$ for some nonzero integer $k$.\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as $x = \\frac{1}{k\\pi}$.\n\nNow we need to find how many values of $k$ make $x$ fall within the interval $(0.0001, 0.001)$.\n\nWe can set up the inequality $\\frac{1}{k\\pi}$ to be within the interval $(0.0001, 0.001)$:\n\n$0.0001 < \\frac{1}{k\\pi} < 0.001$\n\nWe can take the reciprocal of all three sides of the inequality to get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{0.001} < k\\pi < \\frac{1}{0.0001}$\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\n$1000 < k\\pi < 10000$\n\nWe can divide all three sides of the inequality by $\\pi$ to get:\n\n$\\frac{1000}{\\pi} < k < \\frac{10000}{\\pi}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the approximate values of $\\frac{1000}{\\pi}$ and $\\frac{10000}{\\pi}$.\n\n$\\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx 318.31$\n\n$\\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx 3183.10$\n\nNow, we need to find how many integers $k$ fall within the interval $(318.31, 3183.10)$.\n\nSince the interval is open, we can find the number of integers by subtracting the lower bound from the upper bound and subtracting 1.\n\nThe number of integers $k$ is:\n\n3183.10 - 318.31 - 1\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\n2863.79\n\nSince $k$ must be an integer, the largest integer less than or equal to $k$ is 2863.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts on the graph of $y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x}$ in the interval $(0.0001, 0.001)$ is:\n\n2863\n\nHowever, we must note that this does not count $k = 0$ as an x-intercept since it is not in the interval we're looking at.\n\nSo the answer is 2863."
