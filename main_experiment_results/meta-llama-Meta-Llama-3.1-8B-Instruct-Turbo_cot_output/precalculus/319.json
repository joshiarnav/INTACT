    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of the distance from a point to a plane in 3D space. \n\nStep 1: Set up a coordinate system with vertex $A$ at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$ and the three adjacent vertices at $(10,0,0)$, $(0,10,0)$, and $(0,0,10)$. The plane can be represented by the equation $ax + by + cz + d = 0$.\n\nStep 2: Since we know that the three vertices adjacent to vertex $A$ are at heights 10, 11, and 12 above the plane, we can substitute their coordinates into the equation of the plane to get three separate equations:\n\n- $10a + d = 10$\n- $10b + d = 11$\n- $10c + d = 12$\n\nStep 3: Subtract the first equation from the second equation to get: $9b = 1$. Solving for $b$, we get $b = \\frac{1}{9}$.\n\nStep 4: Subtract the first equation from the third equation to get: $9c = 2$. Solving for $c$, we get $c = \\frac{2}{9}$.\n\nStep 5: Substitute the values of $b$ and $c$ back into the first equation: $10a + d = 10$. We know that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1$, since the vector $(a, b, c)$ is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane.\n\nStep 6: Substitute $b = \\frac{1}{9}$ and $c = \\frac{2}{9}$ into the equation $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1$: $a^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2}{9}\\right)^2 = 1$. Solving for $a^2$, we get $a^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{81} - \\frac{4}{81} = \\frac{76}{81}$.\n\nStep 7: Solve for $a$: $a = \\sqrt{\\frac{76}{81}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{76}}{9}$.\n\nStep 8: Substitute $a = \\frac{\\sqrt{76}}{9}$ and $b = \\frac{1}{9}$ and $c = \\frac{2}{9}$ into the equation of the plane: $\\frac{\\sqrt{76}}{9} x + \\frac{1}{9} y + \\frac{2}{9} z + d = 0$.\n\nStep 9: The distance $p$ from the origin to the plane is given by the formula $p = \\frac{|d|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} = \\frac{|d|}{1}$, since $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1$. To find the distance from the origin to the plane, we need to find $d$.\n\nStep 10: Substitute the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ back into the first equation: $10\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{76}}{9}\\right) + d = 10$. Solving for $d$, we get $d = 10 - \\frac{10\\sqrt{76}}{9}$.\n\nStep 11: Simplify the expression for $d$: $d = \\frac{90 - 10\\sqrt{76}}{9} = \\frac{90 - 10\\sqrt{4 \\cdot 19}}{9} = \\frac{90 - 20\\sqrt{19}}{9}$.\n\nStep 12: The distance $p$ from the origin to the plane is: $p = \\frac{|d|}{1} = \\frac{90 - 20\\sqrt{19}}{9}$. We can simplify this expression by rationalizing the denominator and combining the constants in the numerator and denominator.\n\nStep 13: To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator: $\\frac{90 - 20\\sqrt{19}}{9} \\cdot \\frac{9}{9} = \\frac{90 \\cdot 9 - 20\\sqrt{19} \\cdot 9}{9 \\cdot 9} = \\frac{810 - 180\\sqrt{19}}{81}$.\n\nStep 14: The expression is now in the desired form: $\\frac{r - \\sqrt{s}}{t} = \\frac{810 - 180\\sqrt{19}}{81}$. We can simplify the constants in the numerator and denominator by combining them.\n\nStep 15: Combine the constants in the numerator: $810 - 180\\sqrt{19} = 810 - 180\\left(\\sqrt{19}\\right)$.\n\nStep 16: Now, we have the final expression: $\\frac{810 - 180\\sqrt{19}}{81}$.\n\nStep 17: Simplify the constants in the numerator and denominator: $\\frac{810 - 180\\sqrt{19}}{81} = \\frac{90 - 20\\sqrt{19}}{9}$.\n\nStep 18: Since we are asked to find $r+s+t$, we need to add up the values of $r$, $s$, and $t$: $r + s + t = 90 + 19 + 9$.\n\nStep 19: Add up the values of $r$, $s$, and $t$: $r + s + t = 90 + 19 + 9 = 118$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{118}$"
