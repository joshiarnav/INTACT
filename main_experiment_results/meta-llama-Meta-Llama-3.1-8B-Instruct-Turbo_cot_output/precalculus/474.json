    "problem": "What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that all the roots of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity?",
    "solution": "Multiplying the equation $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ by $z^2 + 1$, we get $z^6 + 1 = 0$.  Multiplying this equation by $z^6 - 1 = 0$, we get $z^{12} - 1 = 0$.  Therefore, every root of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ is a $12^{\\text{th}}$ root of unity.\n\nWe can factor $z^{12} - 1 = 0$ as\n\\[(z^6 - 1)(z^6 + 1) = (z^6 - 1)(z^2 + 1)(z^4 - z^2 + 1) = 0.\\]The $12^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity are $e^{0}$, $e^{2 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{4 \\pi i/12}$, $\\dots$, $e^{22 \\pi i/12}$.  We see that $e^{0}$, $e^{4 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{8 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{12 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{16 \\pi i/12}$, and $e^{20 \\pi i/12}$ are the roots of $z^6 - 1 = 0$.  Also, $e^{6 \\pi i/12} = e^{\\pi i/2} = i$ and $e^{18 \\pi i/12} = e^{3 \\pi i/2} = -i$ are the roots of $z^2 + 1 = 0$.  Thus, the roots of\n\\[z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0\\]are the remaining four $12^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity, namely $e^{2 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{10 \\pi i/12}$, $e^{14 \\pi i/12}$, and $e^{22 \\pi i/12}$.  The complex number $e^{2 \\pi i/12}$ is a primitive $12^{\\text{th}}$ root of unity, so by definition, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $(e^{2 \\pi i/12})^n = 1$ is 12.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the roots of the given equation $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$. \n\nLet $w = z^2$. Then the equation becomes $w^2 - w + 1 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in terms of $w$, and it can be solved using the quadratic formula: \n\n$w = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\n\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $b = -1$, and $c = 1$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$w = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}$\n$w = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4}}{2}$\n$w = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$.\n\nThe roots of the quadratic equation $w^2 - w + 1 = 0$ are of the form $\\frac{1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nSince $w = z^2$, the roots of the original equation $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ are the square roots of the roots of the quadratic equation. \n\nThe square roots of $\\frac{1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ are $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+i}{2}$ and $-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+i}{2}$.\n\nThe square roots of $\\frac{1 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ are $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-i}{2}$ and $-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-i}{2}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that these roots are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity. \n\nRecall that the $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity are given by $e^{2\\pi ik/n}$, where $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$. \n\nWe can rewrite the roots of the equation in polar form as follows:\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+i}{2} = e^{i\\pi/3}$\n$-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+i}{2} = e^{-i\\pi/3}$\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-i}{2} = e^{-i\\pi/3}$\n$-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-i}{2} = e^{i\\pi/3}$.\n\nSince these roots can be expressed as $e^{i2k\\pi/6}$, where $k = \\pm1, \\pm2$, they are $12^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that all the roots of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ are $n^{\\text{th}}$ roots of unity is $n = \\boxed{12}$."
