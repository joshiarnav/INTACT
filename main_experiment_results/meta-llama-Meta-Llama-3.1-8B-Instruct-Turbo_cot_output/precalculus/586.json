    "model_solution": "To convert the point from rectangular coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, we need to find the values of $r$, $\\theta$, and $z$. \n\n1. The value of $z$ is the same in both rectangular and cylindrical coordinates, so we can find it by simply looking at the $z$-coordinate of the given point.\n   $z = -1$\n\n2. The value of $r$ is the distance from the point to the $z$-coordinate axis.  It can be calculated as follows:\n   $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$\n   $r = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-2\\sqrt{3})^2}$\n   $r = \\sqrt{4 + 12}$\n   $r = \\sqrt{16}$\n   $r = 4$\n\n3. The value of $\u03b8$ is the angle between the positive $x$-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point.  It can be calculated as follows:\n   $\u03b8 = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$\n   $\u03b8 = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{-2\\sqrt{3}}{-2}\\right)$\n   $\u03b8 = \\arctan(\\sqrt{3})$\n   $\u03b8 = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$\n\nHowever, the point $(-2,-2\\sqrt{3},-1)$ actually lies in the third quadrant where the arctangent function's range of $\\theta$ in the context of $\\arctan(\\frac{y}{x})$ yields an angle less than $\\pi$. However, we must consider in which quadrant the point is located in. Upon inspection we find that the point is in the third quadrant.\n\nTo find the correct angle, we must add $\\pi$ to $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$:\n   $\u03b8 = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\pi$\n   $\u03b8 = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{3\\pi}{3}$\n   $\u03b8 = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}$\n\nSo the point $(-2,-2\\sqrt{3},-1)$ in cylindrical coordinates is given by $\\left(4, \\frac{4\\pi}{3}, -1\\right)$."
