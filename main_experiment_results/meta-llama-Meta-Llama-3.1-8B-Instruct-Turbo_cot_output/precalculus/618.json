    "solution": "The vector pointing from $(-1,1,1)$ to $(1,-1,1)$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$  Since the plane we are interested in is perpendicular to the plane $x + 2y + 3z = 5,$ its normal vector must be orthogonal to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}.$  But the normal vector of the plane is also orthogonal to $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$  So, to find the normal vector of the plane we are interested in, we take the cross product of these vectors:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -6 \\\\ -6 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Scaling, we take $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector.  Therefore, the equation of the plane is of the form\n\\[x + y - z + D = 0.\\]Substituting the coordinates of $(-1,1,1),$ we find that the equation of the plane is $\\boxed{x + y - z + 1 = 0}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the equation of the plane passing through the points $(-1,1,1)$ and $(1,-1,1)$, we need to find a normal vector to the plane. Since we know that the plane is perpendicular to the plane $x + 2y + 3z = 5$, we can use the normal vector of the given plane as a direction vector for the line connecting the two points.\n\nThe normal vector of the given plane $x + 2y + 3z = 5$ is $\\mathbf{n} = \\langle 1, 2, 3 \\rangle$.\n\nWe can use the two points to find the direction vector of the line connecting them, which will be parallel to the plane we want to find:\n\n$\\mathbf{v} = \\langle 1 - (-1), -1 - 1, 1 - 1 \\rangle = \\langle 2, -2, 0 \\rangle$.\n\nSince the plane we want to find is perpendicular to the given plane, its normal vector will be perpendicular to $\\mathbf{n} = \\langle 1, 2, 3 \\rangle$. We can also see that $\\mathbf{v} = \\langle 2, -2, 0 \\rangle$ is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{n} = \\langle 1, 2, 3 \\rangle$, so $\\mathbf{v}$ is a normal vector to the plane we want to find.\n\nWe can use either point $(-1,1,1)$ or $(1,-1,1)$ to write the equation of the plane. Let's use $(-1,1,1)$. The equation of the plane is:\n\n$A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) = 0$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{n} = \\langle A, B, C \\rangle$ is the normal vector of the plane and $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is a point on the plane.\n\nWe can substitute $\\mathbf{n} = \\langle 2, -2, 0 \\rangle$ and $(x_0, y_0, z_0) = (-1, 1, 1)$ into the equation above:\n\n$2(x + 1) - 2(y - 1) + 0(z - 1) = 0$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n$2x + 2 - 2y + 2 = 0$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$2x - 2y + 4 = 0$\n\nDivide the equation by 2:\n\n$x - y + 2 = 0$\n\nTherefore, the equation of the plane is:\n\n$x - y + 2 = 0$"
