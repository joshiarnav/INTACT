    "model_solution": "To find the equation of the plane, we need to use the foot of the perpendicular from the origin to the plane. The foot of the perpendicular is given as (12, -4, 3).\n\nWhen a line is perpendicular to a plane, the direction of the line is the same as the normal (or perpendicular) vector to the plane. The perpendicular vector from the origin to the plane is given by the coordinates of the foot of the perpendicular, which is (12, -4, 3).\n\nThe coefficients A, B, and C in the equation of the plane correspond to the components of the normal vector. So, the equation of the plane can be written as:\n\nAx + By + Cz + D = 0\n\nwhere A = 12, B = -4, and C = 3.\n\nNow we need to find the value of D. We can use the coordinates of the foot of the perpendicular, (12, -4, 3), to find D. To do this, we substitute these values into the equation:\n\n12(12) + (-4)(-4) + 3(3) + D = 0\n\nExpanding the equation gives:\n\n144 + 16 + 9 + D = 0\n\nCombine the constants:\n\n169 + D = 0\n\nNow solve for D:\n\nD = -169\n\nNow we have all the coefficients, we can write the equation of the plane as:\n\n12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0"
