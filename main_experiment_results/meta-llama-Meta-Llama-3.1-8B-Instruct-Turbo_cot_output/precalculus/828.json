    "model_solution": "To find the angle between vectors $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, let's first consider the properties of the dot product, which is given by $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = |\\mathbf{a}| |\\mathbf{b}| \\cos(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nGiven that the angle between vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is $43^\\circ$, we can use the dot product to find the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$.\n\nThe dot product between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is given by $(-\\mathbf{a}) \\cdot \\mathbf{b}$. Since the dot product is linear, we can rewrite this as $-\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}$. \n\nThe magnitude of $-\\mathbf{a}$ is the same as the magnitude of $\\mathbf{a}$, since multiplying a vector by a scalar does not change its magnitude. Therefore, we can rewrite the dot product as $-\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = |\\mathbf{a}| |\\mathbf{b}| \\cos(\\theta)$.\n\nHowever, the negative sign in front of the dot product will reverse the sign of the cosine term. This is equivalent to subtracting the angle from $180^\\circ$, since the cosine function has a period of $360^\\circ$. \n\nThus, the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is $180^\\circ - 43^\\circ = 137^\\circ$."
