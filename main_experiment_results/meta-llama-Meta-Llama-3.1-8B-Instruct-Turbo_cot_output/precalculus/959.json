    "model_solution": "To find the point where the line passing through $(3,4,1)$ and $(5,1,6)$ intersects the $xy$-plane, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the direction vector** of the line. The direction vector is given by the difference between the two points. Let's call the points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$. Then, the direction vector is $(x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1, z_2 - z_1)$.\n\nIn this case, $(x_1, y_1, z_1) = (3, 4, 1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2) = (5, 1, 6)$. So, the direction vector is $(5 - 3, 1 - 4, 6 - 1) = (2, -3, 5)$.\n\n2. **Write the parametric equations** of the line. The parametric equations of the line passing through a point $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ with a direction vector $(a, b, c)$ are:\n\n$x = x_1 + at$\n$y = y_1 + bt$\n$z = z_1 + ct$\n\nIn this case, $(x_1, y_1, z_1) = (3, 4, 1)$ and the direction vector is $(2, -3, 5)$. So, the parametric equations of the line are:\n\n$x = 3 + 2t$\n$y = 4 - 3t$\n$z = 1 + 5t$\n\n3. **Find the point where the line intersects the xy-plane**. The $xy$-plane is defined by $z = 0$. To find the point where the line intersects the $xy$-plane, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $z = 0$. \n\nSubstituting $z = 0$ into the parametric equation $z = 1 + 5t$, we get:\n\n$0 = 1 + 5t$\n\nSolving for $t$, we get:\n\n$-1 = 5t$\n$t = \\frac{-1}{5}$\n\n4. **Find the point of intersection**. Now that we have the value of $t$, we can find the point of intersection by substituting $t = \\frac{-1}{5}$ into the parametric equations.\n\n$x = 3 + 2t = 3 + 2\\left(\\frac{-1}{5}\\right) = 3 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{13}{5}$\n$y = 4 - 3t = 4 - 3\\left(\\frac{-1}{5}\\right) = 4 + \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{23}{5}$\n$z = 1 + 5t = 1 + 5\\left(\\frac{-1}{5}\\right) = 1 - 1 = 0$\n\nSo, the point where the line intersects the $xy$-plane is $\\left(\\frac{13}{5}, \\frac{23}{5}, 0\\right)$."
