Within the interval [-100, 100], there are approximately 32 periods of the sine curve.\n\n4. **Intersection Points within One Period:** Within one period of the sine curve, the line \\(y = x/100\\) intersects the sine curve twice.\n\n5. **Total Number of Intersection Points:** Since there are approximately 32 periods of the sine curve within the interval [-100, 100], and each period contains two intersection points, we can estimate that there are approximately 64 intersection points.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the possibility of intersection points at the endpoints of the interval [-100, 100]. Since the line \\(y = x/100\\) intersects the sine curve at least twice within each period, and there are 32 periods, we can be sure that there are at least 64 intersection points.\n\n6. **Final Answer:** Based on our analysis, we can conclude that the equation \\(\\frac{x}{100} = \\sin x\\) has at least 64 real solutions within the interval [-100, 100]."
