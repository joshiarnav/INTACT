    "problem": "A 1$\\%$ late charge was added to Jenna's bill on the $30^{\\text{th}}$ day past its due date. The resulting total was then increased by 1$\\%$ because she did not pay the bill in the next 30 days either. Her original bill was $\\$400$. Exactly how much is the bill now?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The first late charge brings the bill to $400 \\cdot 1.01 = 400 + 4 = 404$. The second late charge brings the bill to $404 \\cdot 1.01 = 404 + 4.04 = \\boxed{408.04}$ dollars.\n\n-OR-\n\nEach increase multiples the bill by $1+1\\%=1.01$. Therefore, her final bill is $\\$400(1.01)^2=\\$408.04$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the amount added to Jenna's bill on the 30th day past its due date.\nTo find the amount added, we need to calculate 1% of the original bill. The original bill is $400, so the late charge is 1% of $400, which is 0.01 * $400 = $4.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the new total after the first late charge.\nThe new total after the first late charge is the original bill plus the late charge. So, the new total is $400 + $4 = $404.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the amount added to Jenna's bill after the next 30 days.\nAnother 1% late charge is added to the new total. This charge is 1% of $404, which is 0.01 * $404 = $4.04.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final total after the second late charge.\nThe final total after the second late charge is the new total plus the second late charge. So, the final total is $404 + $4.04 = $408.04.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{408.04}$",
