    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "From the information given, we have $x^2 = 2x + 48$. Rearranging, we get $x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$, which we can factor as $(x+6)(x-8) = 0$. Therefore, $x = -6\\text{ or }8$.  Since we want the lesser, $\\boxed{-6}$ is our answer.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double, let's start by defining the problem algebraically. \n\nLet x be the integer we're looking for. According to the problem, the square of x is 48 more than the double of x. This can be written as:\n\nx^2 = 2x + 48\n\nThis equation represents the relationship between the square of the integer and its double, with the added constant of 48.\nTo solve for x, we need to rearrange the equation into a quadratic equation format, which is:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 48 = 0\n\nThis equation is now in the standard form of a quadratic equation, ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -2, and c = -48. \n\nNext, we can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is given by:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nSubstituting the values of a, b, and c into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a((-2)^2 - 4(1)(-48))) / 2(1)\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a(4 + 192)) / 2\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a196) / 2\nx = (2 \u00b1 14) / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible values for x:\n\nx = (2 + 14) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8\nx = (2 - 14) / 2 = -\nTo find the least integer, we need to consider both possible values for x:\n\nx = (2 + 14) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8\nx = (2 - 14) / 2 = -12 / 2 = -6\n\nSince we're looking for the least integer, we compare the two values: 8 and -6. The least integer between these two is -6.\n\nTherefore, the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double is $\\boxed{-6}$.",
