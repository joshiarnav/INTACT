    "solution": "We first draw a diagram: [asy]\npair A, B, C, E, F;\nA = (0, 4);\nB = (-3, 0);\nC = (7, 0);\nE = 0.5 * A + 0.5 * C;\nF = 0.5 * A + 0.5 * B;\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--E--F--cycle);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\n[/asy] Since $F$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, the area of $\\triangle AFC$ is half of the area of $\\triangle ABC,$ or 12 square units. Following the same reasoning, we see that $E$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AC},$ so the area of $\\triangle CEF$ is half that of $\\triangle AFC,$ or $\\boxed{6}$ square units.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of $\\triangle CEF$, we need to understand the relationship between the areas of similar triangles. Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the sides of $\\triangle ABC$, $\\triangle CEF$ is similar to $\\triangle ABC$. The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths. \n\n## Step 1: Determine the ratio of the side lengths of $\\triangle CEF$ to $\\triangle ABC$.\nThe ratio of the side lengths of $\\triangle CEF$ to $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$ because $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the sides of $\\triangle ABC$. \n\nPlease let me proceed to the next step.\n## Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the areas of $\\triangle CEF$ to $\\triangle ABC$.\nThe ratio of the areas of $\\triangle CEF$ to $\\triangle ABC$ is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths, which is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.
