    "solution": "Let the smaller angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$ be $\\theta$. Note that the centers of the two circles lie on the angle bisector of the angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$. Also note that if $(x,y)$ is on said angle bisector, we have that $\\frac{y}{x}=\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}$. Let $\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=m_1$, for convenience. Therefore if $(x,y)$ is on the angle bisector, then $x=\\frac{y}{m_1}$. Now let the centers of the two relevant circles be $(a/m_1 , a)$ and $(b/m_1 , b)$ for some positive reals $a$ and $b$. These two circles are tangent to the $x$-axis, so the radii of the circles are $a$ and $b$ respectively. We know that the point $(9,6)$ is a point on both circles, so we have that\n\\[(9-\\frac{a}{m_1})^2+(6-a)^2=a^2\\]\n\\[(9-\\frac{b}{m_1})^2+(6-b)^2=b^2\\]\nExpanding these and manipulating terms gives\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}a^2-[(18/m_1)+12]a+117=0\\]\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}b^2-[(18/m_1)+12]b+117=0\\]\nIt follows that $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the quadratic\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}x^2-[(18/m_1)+12]x+117=0\\]\nIt follows from Vieta's Formulas that the product of the roots of this quadratic is $117m_1^2$, but we were also given that the product of the radii was 68. Therefore $68=117m_1^2$, or $m_1^2=\\frac{68}{117}$. Note that the half-angle formula for tangents is\n\\[\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\cos{\\theta}}{1+\\cos{\\theta}}}\\]\nTherefore\n\\[\\frac{68}{117}=\\frac{1-\\cos{\\theta}}{1+\\cos{\\theta}}\\]\nSolving for $\\cos{\\theta}$ gives that $\\cos{\\theta}=\\frac{49}{185}$. It then follows that $\\sin{\\theta}=\\sqrt{1-\\cos^2{\\theta}}=\\frac{12\\sqrt{221}}{185}$.\nIt then follows that $m=\\tan{\\theta}=\\frac{12\\sqrt{221}}{49}$. Therefore $a=12$, $b=221$, and $c=49$. The desired answer is then $12+221+49=\\boxed{282}$.",
