    "solution": "Without loss of generality, let $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, $(0,2)$, and $(2,2)$ be the vertices of the square. Suppose the endpoints of the segment lie on the two sides of the square determined by the vertex $(0,0)$. Let the two endpoints of the segment have coordinates $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$. Because the segment has length 2, $x^2+y^2=4$. Using the midpoint formula, we find that the midpoint of the segment has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Let $d$ be the distance from $(0,0)$ to $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Using the distance formula we see that $d=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2}= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}\\left(x^2+y^2\\right)}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}(4)}=1$. Thus the midpoints lying on the sides determined by vertex $(0,0)$ form a quarter-circle with radius 1.\n[asy] size(100); pointpen=black;pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); pair A=(0,0),B=(2,0),C=(2,2),D=(0,2); D(A--B--C--D--A);  picture p; draw(p,CR(A,1));draw(p,CR(B,1));draw(p,CR(C,1));draw(p,CR(D,1)); clip(p,A--B--C--D--cycle); add(p); [/asy]\nThe set of all midpoints forms a quarter circle at each corner of the square.

To see this, consider the segment's endpoints moving from $(0,0)$ to $(2,0)$ and from $(0,0)$ to $(0,2)$.
