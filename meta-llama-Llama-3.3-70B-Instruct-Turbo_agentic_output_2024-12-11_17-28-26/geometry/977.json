    "problem": "The corner of a unit cube is chopped off such that the cut runs through the three vertices adjacent to the vertex of the chosen corner.  What is the height of the remaining cube when the freshly-cut face is placed on a table?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The major diagonal has a length of $\\sqrt{3}$.  The volume of the pyramid is $1/6$, and so its height $h$ satisfies $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot h\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(\\sqrt{2})^2=1/6$ since  the freshly cut face is an equilateral triangle of side length $\\sqrt{2}$.  Thus $h=\\sqrt{3}/3$, and the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the geometry of the situation. When the corner of the cube is chopped off, it creates a new face that is a triangle. This triangle is formed by cutting through the three vertices adjacent to the chosen corner. Let's consider the properties of this cut and the resulting triangle.\n\nThe cut runs through the three vertices adjacent to the chosen corner, which means it forms an equilateral triangle, as all the edges of the cube are of equal length (since it's a unit cube). This equilateral triangle will be the base of the cut-off corner. \n\nNext, we can determine the side length of this equilateral triangle to better understand the geometry of the cut. Since the cube is a unit cube, each edge has a length of 1 unit. The distance from the chosen corner to the adjacent vertices (which form the equilateral triangle) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions, but given the cube's symmetry, we can reason that the side length of the equilateral triangle formed by the cut is the same as the distance between two adjacent vertices of the cube, which would be the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with both other sides being 1 (\nTo find the side length of the equilateral triangle, we consider the right-angled triangle formed by the edge of the cube and the face diagonal of one of its faces. The edge of the cube is 1 unit, and the face diagonal (which is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with both other sides being 1) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the two shorter sides, and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse. \n\nFor the face diagonal: $1^2 + 1^2 = c^2$, so $2 = c^2$, and therefore $c = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nHowever, the distance we're interested in for the side of the equilateral triangle is actually the space diagonal of the cube (from one corner of the cube to the opposite corner of the cube), because this line connects two vertices that are adjacent to the corner being cut off and passes through the third vertex adjacent to the corner being cut off. But what we actually need for our calculation is the height of the remaining cube when the freshly-cut face\nTo find the height of the remaining cube when the freshly!-cut face is placed on a table, we need to understand that the cut-off corner forms a tetrahedron, and the remaining part of the cube will have a height that is less than the original height of the cube.\n\nSince the cut runs through the three vertices adjacent to the chosen corner, the base of the cut-off tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle. The height of the tetrahedron (from the vertex of the cube that was chopped off to the center of the equilateral triangle base) can be related to the side length of the equilateral triangle.\n\nHowever, given the cube's symmetry and the geometry of the cut, a more straightforward approach to finding the height of the remaining cube is to consider the similar triangles formed by the original cube and the cut-off tetrahedron. \n\nWhen the cut face is placed on the table, the height of the remaining cube is the distance from the table to the opposite vertex of the cube. Since the cut face is an equilateral triangle and considering the properties of the tetrahedron formed by the cut, we can observe that the height of the remaining cube will be related to the altitude of the\nTo find the height of the remaining cube when the freshly-cut face is placed on a table, let's analyze the situation further.\n\nThe cut-off corner forms a tetrahedron with an equilateral triangle base.

When the cut face is placed on the table, we are essentially looking for the distance from the table (the equilateral triangle face) to the opposite vertex of the cube.\n\nGiven the symmetry of the cube and the properties of the tetrahedron, we can simplify our approach by considering the similar triangles formed within the cube and the tetrahedron.
