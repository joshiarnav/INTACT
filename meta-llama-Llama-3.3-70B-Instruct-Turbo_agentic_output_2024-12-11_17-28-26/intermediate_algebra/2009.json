This means that the function $f(x)$ is its own inverse.\n\n## Step 2: Finding the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$\nTo find $f^{-1}(x)$, we start with the given function $f(x) = \\frac{2x + 3}{kx - 2}$ and interchange $x$ and $y$ to get $x = \\frac{2y + 3}{ky - 2}$. Then we solve this equation for $y$.\n\n## Step 3: Solving for $y$\nWe have $x = \\frac{2y + 3}{ky - 2}$. Cross-multiplying gives $x(ky - 2) = 2y + 3$, which simplifies to $kxy - 2x = 2y + 3$. Rearranging terms yields $kxy - 2y = 2x + 3$. Factoring out\n## Step 4: Factoring out $y$ and solving for $y$\nWe factor out $y$ from the equation $kxy - 2y = 2x + 3$ to get $y(kx - 2) = 2x + 3$. Then, solving for $y$ gives $y = \\frac{2x + 3}{kx - 2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Setting $f(x) = f^{-1}(x)$\nSince we are given that $f^{-1}(x) = f(x)$, we set the expression for $f(x)$ equal to the expression for $f^{-1}(x)$. This gives $\\frac{2x + 3}{kx - 2} = \\frac{2x + 3}{kx - 2}$, which is always true for any $k$ where the function is defined, indicating that the condition $f^{-1}(x) = f(x)$ is satisfied by the nature of $f(x)$ being its own inverse.

This implies that $f(x)$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. To check this, we can find the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$.\n\n## Step 7: Finding the derivative of $f(x)$\nLet's find $f'(x)$.\n\\[f'(x) = \\frac{(kx - 2)(2) - (2x + 3)(k)}{(kx - 2)^2}\\]\n\\[f'(x) = \\frac{2kx - 4 - 2kx - 3k}{(kx - 2)^2}\\]\n\\[f'(x) = \\frac{-3k}{(kx - 2)^2}\\]\n\n## Step 8: Analyzing the derivative\nFor $f(x)$ to be strictly increasing or decreasing, $f'(x)$ must not change sign. The denominator $(kx - 2)^2$ is always positive for $kx\n## Step 9: Determining the condition for $k$\nThe sign of $f'(x)$ is determined by the numerator $-3k$. For $f(x)$ to be strictly increasing or decreasing, $-3k$ must be either strictly positive or strictly negative. This implies $k$ must be either strictly negative or strictly positive.
