    "solution": "Let $q(x) = x^2 p(x) - 1.$  Then $q(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5, and $q(n) = 0$ for $n = 1,$ 2, 3, and 4, so\n\\[q(x) = (ax + b)(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)\\]for some constants $a$ and $b.$\n\nWe know that $q(0) = 0^2 \\cdot p(0) - 1 = -1.$  But setting $x = 0$ in the equation above, we get\n\\[q(0) = 24b,\\]so $b = -\\frac{1}{24}.$\n\nWe also know that the coefficient of $x$ in $q(x) = x^2 p(x) - 1$ is 0.  The coefficient of $x$ in\n\\[q(x) = (ax + b)(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)\\]is\n\\begin{align*}\n&a(-1)(-2)(-3)(-4) + b(-2)(-3)(-4) \\\\\n&\\quad + b(-1)(-3)(-4) + b(-1)(-2)(-4) + b(-1)(-2)(-3) \\\\\n&= 24a - 50b,\n\\end{align*}so $a = \\frac{50b}{24} = -\\frac{25}{288}.$  Hence,\n\\[q(x) = \\left( -\\frac{25}{288} x - \\frac{1}{24} \\right) (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = -\\frac{(25x + 12)(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)}{288}.\\]Then\n\\[q(5) = -\\frac{137}{12},\\]so $p(x) = \\frac{q(5) + 1}{25} = \\boxed{-\\frac{5}{12}}.$",
