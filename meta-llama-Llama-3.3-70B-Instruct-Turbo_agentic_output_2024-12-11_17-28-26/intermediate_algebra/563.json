    "problem": "For how many real values of $c$ do we have $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We have $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\sqrt{{\\frac12}^2 + (-c)^2} = \\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14}$, so $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ gives us $\\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14} = \\frac34$.  Squaring both sides gives $c^2 + \\frac14 = \\frac9{16}$, so $c^2=\\frac5{16}$.  Taking the square root of both sides gives $c = \\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ and $c=-\\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ as solutions, so there are $\\boxed{2}$ real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nWe also could have solved this equation by noting that $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ means that the complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is $\\frac34$ units from the origin in the complex plane.  Therefore, it is on the circle centered at the origin with radius $\\frac34$.  The complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is also on the vertical line that intersects the real axis at $\\frac12$, which is inside the aforementioned circle.  Since this line goes inside the circle, it must intersect the circle at $\\boxed{2}$ points, which correspond to the values of $c$ that satisfy the original equation.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll start by using the definition of the absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number. The absolute value of a complex number $a+bi$ is given by $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. Here, we have $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$. \n\nSo, our first step is to rewrite the equation using this definition: $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac12\\right)^2 + (-c)^2} = \\frac34$. This simplifies to $\\sqrt{\\frac14 + c^2} = \\frac34$.\nTo solve for $c$, we'll start by squaring both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root. Squaring both sides gives us: $\\frac14 + c^2 = \\left(\\frac34\\right)^2$. \n\nThis simplifies to $\\frac14 + c^2 = \\frac{9}{16}$. \n\nNext, we'll isolate $c^2$ by subtracting $\\frac14$ from both sides. To do this, we need to get a common denominator, which is $16$. So, $\\frac14$ is equivalent to $\\frac{4}{16}$. \n\nSubtracting $\\frac{4}{16}$ from $\\frac{9}{16}$ gives us: $c^2 = \\frac{9}{16} - \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{5}{16}$.\n\nNow, to solve for $c$, we take the square root of both sides. Remembering that $c$ can be positive or negative, we get: $c = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{16}}$.\n\nSince $\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}$, we have\nWe have $c = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{16}} = \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}$. This means there are two real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation: $c = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}$ and $c = -\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}$. \n\nTherefore, the number of real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation is $\\boxed{2}$.",
