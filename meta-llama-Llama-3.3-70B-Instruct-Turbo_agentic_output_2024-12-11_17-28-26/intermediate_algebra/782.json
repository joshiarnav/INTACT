    "solution": "Squaring the equation $a + b + c = 0,$ we get\n\\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc) = 0.\\]Hence, $2(ab + ac + bc) = -(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \\le 0,$ so\n\\[ab + ac + bc \\le 0.\\]Equality occurs when $a = b = c = 0.$\n\nNow, set $c = 0,$ so $a + b = 0,$ or $b = -a.$  Then\n\\[ab + ac + bc = ab = -a^2\\]can take on all nonpositive values.  Therefore, the set of all possible values of $ab + ac + bc$ is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,0]}.$",

This implies that the sum of any two numbers is the negation of the third, i.e., $a + b = -c$, $a + c = -b$, and $b + c = -a$.\n\n## Step 2: Manipulate the given equation to find a relationship\nSince we need to find the set of all possible values of $ab + ac + bc$, let's manipulate the equation $a + b + c = 0$ to get closer to the form $ab + ac + bc$.
