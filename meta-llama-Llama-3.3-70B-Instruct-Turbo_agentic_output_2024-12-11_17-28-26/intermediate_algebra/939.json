    "solution": "Let $r$ and $s$ be the two common roots.  Then $r$ and $s$ are the roots of\n\\[(x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) - (x^3 + bx^2 + 14 + 8) = (a - b) x^2 - 3x - 2.\\]Note that $r$ and $s$ are also the roots of\n\\begin{align*}\n&4(x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) - 3(x^3 + bx^2 + 14x + 8) \\\\\n&= x^3 + (4a - 3b) x^2 + 2x \\\\\n&= x[x^2 + (4a - 3b) x + 2].\n\\end{align*}Since the constant coefficient of $x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6$ is nonzero, both $r$ and $s$ are non-zero.  Therefore, $r$ and $s$ are the roots of\n\\[x^2 + (4a - 3b) x + 2.\\]Hence, both $r$ and $s$ are the roots of $-x^2 + (3b - 4a) x - 2.$  But $r$ and $s$ are also the roots of $(a - b) x^2 - 3x - 2,$ so the coefficients must match.

Since both polynomials have $r$ and $s$ as common roots, we can express the polynomials in terms of their factors.\n\nBy Vieta's formulas for the first polynomial, we have:\n$r + s + t = -a$\n$rs + rt + st = 11$\n$rst = -6$\n\nAnd for the second polynomial:\n$r + s + u = -b$\n$rs + ru + su = 14$\n$rst = -8$ (note that $rst$ is the same for both polynomials since $r$ and $s$ are common roots)\n\nNow we have a system of equations to work with. We'll proceed from here in the next step.\n## Step 1: Express $t$ and $u$ in terms of $r$ and $s$\nFrom the equation $rst = -6$ for the first polynomial and $rst = -8$ for the second polynomial, we notice that $rst$ cannot be equal to both $-6$ and $-8$ if $r$, $s$, and $t$ are the same for both equations. This discrepancy suggests we should reconsider our approach to directly compare the two polynomials.\n\n## Step 2: Reconsider the relationship between the two polynomials\nGiven that $r$ and $s$ are common roots, we can express both polynomials as having a common factor $(x - r)(x - s)$. However, to simplify our approach, let's directly compare the coefficients and use the fact that the two polynomials share two roots.\n\n## Step 3: Direct comparison of polynomial coefficients\nSubtracting the first polynomial from the second gives us:\n$(x^3 + bx^2 + 14x + 8) - (x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) = 0$\nSimplifying yields:\n$(b - a)x^2 +\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation obtained from subtraction\n$(b - a)x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0$\n\nThis equation must have $r$ and $s$ as its roots since the subtraction eliminated the $x^3$ terms and the constant terms difference gives us a quadratic equation that shares the roots $r$ and $s$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Vieta's formulas to the quadratic equation\nFor the quadratic equation $(b - a)x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0$, Vieta's formulas give us:\n$r + s = -\\frac{3}{b-a}$\n$rs = \\frac{2}{b-a}$\n\n## Step 6: Use the original equations to relate $r$, $s$, and $t$ for the first polynomial\nFrom $rst = -6$, we know that $t = -\\frac{6}{rs}$.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute $t$ in the equation $r + s + t = -a$\nSubstituting $t = -\\frac{6}{rs}$ into $r + s + t = -a$ gives $r + s - \\frac\n## Step 1: Express the relationship between $r$, $s$, and $t$ using Vieta's formulas for the first polynomial.\nWe have $r + s + t = -a$, $rs + rt + st = 11$, and $rst = -6$.

However, since $rst = -6$ from the first polynomial, we cannot directly use $rst = -8$ without reconciling the discrepancy.\n\n##\n## Step 1: Reconcile the discrepancy in the product of the roots\nGiven that $rst = -6$ for the first polynomial and $rst = -8$ for the second polynomial, we recognize an inconsistency in directly applying these equations due to the shared roots $r$ and $s$.

            "## Step 1: Reconsider the relationship between the two polynomials and the implications of having two distinct common roots.\nGiven that the two cubic polynomials have two distinct roots in common, we should directly compare the coefficients and use the fact that the two polynomials share two roots. This implies that the difference between the two polynomials must be a quadratic equation that has these two roots.\n\n## Step 2: Subtract the two polynomials to find the quadratic equation that represents the difference.\nSubtracting the first polynomial from the second gives: $(x^3 + bx^2 + 14x + 8) - (x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) = 0$, which simplifies to $(b-a)x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Vieta's formulas to the quadratic equation obtained from subtracting the polynomials.\nThe sum of the roots $r + s = -\\frac{3}{b-a}$ and the product of the roots $rs = \\frac{2}{b-a}$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the Vieta's formulas for the first polynomial to relate $a$ with $r",
