    "solution": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$.",

    "model_solution": "To determine if the seven-digit number $854n526$ is divisible by $11$, we need to apply the divisibility rule for $11$. The rule states that the absolute difference between the sum of digits in the odd positions (units, hundreds, ten-thousands, etc.) and the sum of digits in the even positions (tens, thousands, hundred-thousands, etc.) must be either $0$ or a multiple of $11$. \n\nLet's identify the positions of the digits in the number $854n526$:\n- $8$ is in the first (odd) position,\n- $5$ is in the second (even) position,\n- $4$ is in the third (odd) position,\n- $n$ is in the fourth (even) position,\n- $5$ is in the fifth (odd) position,\n- $2$ is in the sixth (even) position,\n- $6$ is in the seventh (odd) position.\n\nNow, we will calculate the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions. \n\nSum of digits in odd positions $= 8 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 23$.\nTo find the value of $n$, we need to calculate the sum of the digits in the even positions and then apply the divisibility rule for $11$.\n\nSum of digits in even positions $= 5 + n + 2 = 7 + n$.\n\nAccording to the divisibility rule for $11$, the absolute difference between the sum of digits in the odd positions and the sum of digits in the even positions must be either $0$ or a multiple of $11$. \n\nSo, we set up the equation: $|23 - (7 + n)| = 0$ or a multiple of $11$.\n\nThis simplifies to $|16 - n| = 0$ or a multiple of $11$.\n\nTo satisfy this condition, $16 - n$ must be equal to $0$ or a multiple of $11$. \n\nThe possible values for $16 - n$ that are multiples of $11$ are $0$ and $11$. \n\nIf $16 - n = 0$, then $n = 16$, which is not a single-digit number and cannot be a digit in the number $854n526$.\n\nIf $16 - n = 11$, then $n\nTo find the value of $n$, we need to solve the equation $16 - n = 11$.\n\n$16 - n = 11$\n\nSubtracting $16$ from both sides:\n\n$-n = -5$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $-1$:\n\n$n = 5$\n\nTherefore, the value of $n$ that makes the seven-digit number $854n526$ divisible by $11$ is $5$.\n\n$\\boxed{5}$",
