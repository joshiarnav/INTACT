    "problem": "What is the largest number, with its digits all different, whose digits add up to 16?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "For a number to be as large as possible, we want as many places (digits) as possible. To allow for as many digits as possible, we want the digits to be small so that there will be more digits that add up to $16$. We start with the smallest number, $0$ and keep adding the next number. $0+1+2+3+4=10$. However, we cannot add $5$, because then we are left with $16-10-5=1$, and we already have the number $1$. Therefore, the next number to be added would be $16-10=6$.\nNow, we have the numbers $0,1,2,3,4,6$ to form a number. We want the larger places to have larger numbers. Therefore, we order the numbers in decreasing order to form the number $\\boxed{643210}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's start by listing the possible combinations of digits that add up to 16. Since we want the largest number with all different digits, we should start with the largest possible digit, which is 9.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if 9 can be one of the digits. If 9 is one of the digits, the remaining digits must add up to 16 - 9 = 7. \n\nWe will proceed from here in the next step.\nTo continue with the problem, let's consider the case where 9 is one of the digits. The remaining digits must add up to 7. Since we want all different digits, the next largest digit to consider is 7, but 7 is too large because it would leave no remaining sum for other digits (as 7 itself equals the total sum needed, leaving no room for additional digits).\n\nSo, let's consider the next largest digit after 9, which could be 8, but since we've established that 9 should be one of the digits to maximize the number, we look at combinations that include 9 and add up to 16. \n\nGiven that 9 is part of the number, we need digits that add up to 7. The possible combinations without repeating any digits are limited.
