    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since $9^{4000}$ has 3816 digits more than $9^1$, $4000 - 3816 = \\boxed{184}$ numbers have 9 as their leftmost digits.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the pattern for the leftmost digit as the power of 9 increases.\nSince we're raising 9 to various powers, the leftmost digit will follow a pattern in the number of times it repeats due to the cyclical nature of the first digit in powers of 9 (9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) before potentially repeating. However, because we are specifically interested in the number of elements of $T$ that have 9 as their leftmost digit, we need to consider how the number of digits in $9^{4000}$ and the first digit being 9 influences the count.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of powers of 9 that result in a number with the same number of digits as $9^{4000}$.\nGiven that $9^{4000}$ has 3817 digits, numbers in the set $T$ will start having 3817 digits at some power of 9 before $9^{4000}$.
