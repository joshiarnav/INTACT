    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To calculate the average of two numbers, we add them and divide the sum by $2$.  From the given information, we have the equation  \\[\\frac{23+x}{2}=27.\\]  Multiplying both sides by $2$ yields \\[23+x=54.\\]  Thus, $x=54-23=31$.  Finally, the positive difference between $31$ and $23$ is \\[31-23=\\boxed{8}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To find the average of 23 and x, we add them together and divide by 2. The problem states that this average is 27. So, the equation for this situation is:\n\n(23 + x) / 2 = 27\n\nThis will be the starting point for solving the problem.\nTo solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2, which will eliminate the fraction. This gives us:\n\n23 + x = 27 * 2\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\n23 + x = 54\n\nNext step:\nTo solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 23 from both sides of the equation. This gives us:\n\n23 + x - 23 = 54 - 23\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx = 31\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the positive difference between 23 and x. The positive difference between two numbers is the absolute value of their difference. So, we calculate:\n\n|23 - 31| = | -8 | = 8\n\nTherefore, the positive difference between 23 and x is 8.\n\n$\\boxed{8}$",
