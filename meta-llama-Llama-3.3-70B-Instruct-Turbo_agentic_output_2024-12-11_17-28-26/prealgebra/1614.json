    "solution": "First, quantify the number of marbles each person has:\n\n$\\bullet$ Angela has $a$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Brian has $2\\times a$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Caden has $3\\times(2\\times a)$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Daryl has $5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))$ marbles.\n\nIn total, the four people have $a+2\\times a+3\\times(2\\times a)+5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))$ marbles. And that expression equals 78, since in total the four people have 78 marbles. Now evaluate the resulting equation. \\begin{align*}\n78&=a+2\\times a+3\\times(2\\times a)+5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))\\\\\n&=a+2a+3(2a)+5(3(2a))\\\\\n&=a+2a+6a+5(6a)\\\\\n&=a+2a+6a+30a\\\\\n&=39a \\quad\\implies\\\\\na&=\\boxed{2}.\n\\end{align*}",
