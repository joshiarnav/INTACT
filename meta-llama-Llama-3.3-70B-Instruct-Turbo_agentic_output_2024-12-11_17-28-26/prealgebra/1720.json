    "problem": "Given three members of a group -- Alice, Bob, and Carol -- in how many ways can these three be chosen to be the three officers (president, secretary, and treasurer) of the group, assuming no person holds more than one job?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "In this problem we are choosing a committee, so the order in which we choose the 3 people does not matter.  We could have chosen them in any of the following orders (where A is Alice, B is Bob, and C is Carol): ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.  So each possible committee corresponds to $3! = \\boxed{6}$ possible orderings.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "To determine the number of ways to choose the three officers, we first need to identify the number of choices for each position. \n\nSince there are three people (Alice, Bob, and Carol) and three positions (president, secretary, and treasurer), we start by selecting the president. There are 3 possible choices for the president: Alice, Bob, or Carol.\nAfter selecting the president, we move on to the secretary position. Since one person has already been chosen as the president, there are only 2 remaining people to choose from for the secretary position.\n\nSo, for each of the 3 choices for president, there are 2 choices for secretary. This gives us a total of 3 * 2 = 6 possible combinations for president and secretary.\n\nNext, we need to select the treasurer. Since 2 people have already been chosen for the president and secretary positions, there is only 1 person left to choose from for the treasurer position.\n\nSo, for each of the 6 combinations for president and secretary, there is only 1 choice for treasurer. This gives us a total of 6 * 1 = 6 possible combinations for all three positions.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 possible ways to choose the three officers.\n\n$\\boxed{6}$",
