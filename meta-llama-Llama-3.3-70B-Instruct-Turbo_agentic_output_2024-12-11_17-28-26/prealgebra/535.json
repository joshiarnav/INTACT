    "problem": "We have a cube with 4 blue faces and 2 red faces.  What's the probability that when it is rolled, a blue face will be facing up?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We have 6 equally likely outcomes, corresponding to the 6 faces of the cube.  4 of those 6 outcomes are successful ones (meaning a blue face is facing up).  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability of a blue face facing up when the cube is rolled, the first step is to determine the total number of faces on the cube. A standard cube has 6 faces. \n\nSo, we have a total of 6 faces. Next, we'll consider the number of blue faces.\nTo find the probability of a blue face facing up when the cube is rolled, we have already determined that there are a total of 6 faces on the cube. Now, we need to consider the number of blue faces, which is given as 4.\n\nThe probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (in this case, blue faces) by the total number of possible outcomes (total faces). So, the probability of a blue face facing up can be calculated as the number of blue faces divided by the total number of faces.\n\nTherefore, the probability = number of blue faces / total number of faces = 4 / 6.\n\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. So, 4 / 6 simplifies to 2 / 3.\n\nThus, the probability that a blue face will be facing up when the cube is rolled is 2/3.\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$",
