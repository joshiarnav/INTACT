    "problem": "A zoo has a menagerie containing four pairs of different animals, one male and one female for each. The zookeeper wishes to feed the animals in a specific pattern: each time he feeds a single animal, the next one he feeds must be a different gender. If he starts by feeding the male giraffe, how many ways can he feed all the animals?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If the zookeeper starts with the male giraffe, there are 4 females which he can feed next. Once one is selected, there are 3 males he can feed next, then 3 females, 2 males, 2 females, 1 male, and 1 female.\n\nThe total number of possibilities is $4\\times3\\times3\\times2\\times2 = \\boxed{144}$ ways.",

Since he has to alternate genders, the next animal he feeds must be a! female. There are 4 female animals to choose from for the second feeding. \n\nSo, after feeding the male giraffe, there are 4 options for the female to be fed next.\n## Step 2: After feeding the female animal, the zookeeper must feed a male animal.\nSince one male animal (the male giraffe) has already been fed, there are 3 male animals left to choose from for the third feeding.\n\n## Step 3: The zookeeper must now feed another female animal.\nAt this point, one female animal has already been fed, so there are 3 female animals left to choose from for the fourth feeding.\n\n## Step 4: The zookeeper must now feed another male animal.\nAt this point, two male animals (including the male giraffe) have already been fed, so there are 2 male animals left to choose from for the fifth feeding.\n\n## Step 5: The zookeeper must now feed another female animal.\nAt this point, two female animals have already been fed, so there are 2 female animals left to choose from for the sixth feeding.\n\n## Step 6: The zookeeper must now feed the last male animal.\nThere is only 1 male animal left to choose from for the seventh feeding.\n\n## Step 7: The zookeeper must now feed the last female animal.\nThere is only 1 female animal left to choose from for the eighth feeding.\n## Step 8: Calculate the total number of ways to feed the animals.\nTo find the total number of ways, we multiply the number of choices at each step: $4 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 1$.\n\n$4 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 36$\n\n$36 \\times 2 = 72$\n\n$72 \\times 2 = 144$\n\n$144 \\times 1 = 144$\n\n$144 \\times 1 = 144$\n\nThe total number of ways is $144$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{144}$",
