    "problem": "Amanda, Ben, and Carlos share a sum of money. Their portions are in the ratio of 1:2:7, respectively. If Amanda's portion is $\\$$20, what is the total amount of money shared?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We multiply each part of the ratio $1:2:7$ by 20 to make Amanda's part equal 20, and we have \\[1:2:7 = 1\\cdot 20:2\\cdot 20 :7\\cdot 20 = 20:40:140.\\] This means that  Ben's share is $2\\times 20 = 40$ dollars and Carlos's share is $7\\times 20=140$ dollars.  Therefore, the total amount of money shared is $20+40+140=\\boxed{200}$ dollars.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total amount of money shared, we need to first determine the amounts received by Ben and Carlos. Since their portions are in the ratio of 1:2:7, and Amanda's portion is $\\$$20, we can start by finding the value of one part of the ratio. \n\nAmanda's portion is 1 part, and it is equal to $\\$$20. Therefore, 1 part = $\\$$20.\nTo find the total amount of money shared, we can use the ratio and the value of one part to calculate the amounts received by Ben and Carlos.\n\nSince the ratio is 1:2:7, Ben's portion is 2 parts, and Carlos' portion is 7 parts. We already know that 1 part is equal to $\\$$20. \n\nSo, Ben's portion is 2 parts = 2 x $\\$$20 = $\\$$40.\nAnd Carlos' portion is 7 parts = 7 x $\\$$20 = $\\$$140.\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of money shared by adding up the portions received by Amanda, Ben, and Carlos.\nTotal amount = Amanda's portion + Ben's portion + Carlos' portion\n= $\\$$20 + $\\$$40 + $\\$$140\n= $\\$$200.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money shared is $\\boxed{200}$.",
