The vector from the origin to this point is perpendicular to the plane.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the normal vector of the plane\nSince the foot of the perpendicular is given as $(12, -4, 3)$, the vector from the origin to this point, which is $\\vec{n} = <12, -4, 3>$, serves as a normal vector to the plane.\n\n## Step 4: Use the point-normal form of a plane equation\nThe point-normal form of a plane equation is $A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) = 0$, where $(\n## Step 5: Substitute the normal vector and the given point into the point-normal form\nGiven that the normal vector $\\vec{n} = <12, -4, 3>$ and the point $(x_0, y_0, z_0) = (12, -4, 3)$, we substitute these values into the point-normal form of the plane equation: $12(x - 12) - 4(y - (-4)) + 3(z - 3) = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the equation\nExpanding the equation gives $12x - 144 - 4y - 16 + 3z - 9 = 0$. Simplifying further yields $12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Ensure the equation meets the required conditions\nThe equation $12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0$ already has $A > 0$.
