    "problem": "Given that $f(x) = x^k$ where $k < 0$, what is the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$?",
    "solution": "We are looking at the range of $f(x)$ when $x$ is in the interval $[1,\\infty)$. Because $k < 0$, $f(x)$ is decreasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. We see that $f(1) = 1^k = 1$, and as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ approaches 0, but never reaches it.  Hence, on the interval $[1,\\infty)$, $f(x)$ takes on all values between 0 (exclusive) and 1 inclusive, which means the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{(0,1]}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given function\nThe given function is $f(x) = x^k$, where $k < 0$. This means $f(x)$ is a decreasing function as $x$ increases because when $k$ is negative, as $x$ increases, $x^k$ decreases.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the behavior of the function on the interval $[1, \\infty)$\nSince $k < 0$, $f(x)$ represents a function with a form of $1/x^n$ where $n > 0$. This type of function decreases as $x$ increases. On the interval $[1, \\infty)$, the function will decrease from $f(1) = 1^k = 1$ (since any non-zero number to the power of 0 is 1, and any number to the power of any exponent when the base is 1 is 1) towards 0 as $x$ approaches infinity.\n\n## Step 3: Find the range of $f(x)$ on the given interval\nGiven that $f(x)$ starts at 1 when $x = 1$ and decreases towards 0 as $x$ approaches infinity, the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ will be $(0, 1]$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(0, 1]}$"
