    "problem": "A ball travels on a parabolic path in which the height (in feet) is given by the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$, where $t$ is the time after launch. What is the maximum height of the ball, in feet?",
    "solution": "To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \\[-16t^2+80t+21=-16(t^2-5t)+21\\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-5/2)^2=6.25$ inside the parenthesis to get \\begin{align*}\n-16(t^2-5t)+21&=-16(t^2-5t+6.25-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16([t-2.5]^2-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16(t-2.5)^2+121\n\\end{align*}Since $-16(t-2.5)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-2.5)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+121=\\boxed{121}$ feet.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the equation given\nThe equation $-16t^2+80t+21$ represents the height of the ball at time $t$. To find the maximum height, we need to maximize this equation.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the method to maximize a quadratic equation\nThe maximum (or minimum) of a quadratic equation $at^2+bt+c$ occurs at $t = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. In our case, $a = -16$ and $b = 80$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the time $t$ at which the maximum height occurs\nSubstitute $a$ and $b$ into the formula $t = -\\frac{b}{2a}$ to find the time at which the maximum height occurs: $t = -\\frac{80}{2 \\cdot -16} = -\\frac{80}{-32} = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the maximum height by substituting $t$ into the equation\nSubstitute $t = \\frac{5}{2}$ into the equation $-16t^2+80t+21$ to find the maximum height: $-16(\\frac{5}{2})^2 + 80(\\frac{5}{2}) + 21$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the arithmetic to find the maximum height\nCalculate $-16(\\frac{5}{2})^2 = -16 \\cdot \\frac{25}{4} = -100$ and $80(\\frac{5}{2}) = 80 \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} = 200$. Then, $-100 + 200 + 21 = 121$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{121}$"
