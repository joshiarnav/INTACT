    "problem": "A triangular region is bounded by the two coordinate axes and the line given by the equation $2x + y = 6$. What is the area of the region, in square units?",
    "solution": "To start, use the equation to solve for the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the line.  Letting $x$ equal 0, the $y$-intercept is 6.  Letting $y$ equal 0, we find that $2x=6$ so the $x$-intercept is 3.  Using the intercepts, we can graph the line as shown: [asy]size(100,0);\nfill((0,0)--(0,6)--(3,0)--cycle,gray(.7));\nadd(grid(5,8));\ndraw((0,0)--(5,0),linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,8),linewidth(2));\nlabel(\"\",(5,0),E);\nlabel(\"\",(0,8),N);\ndraw((0,6)--(3,0),blue,Arrows);[/asy] We wish to find the area of the shaded region.  This is a right triangle with one base of length 3, and one of length 6.  Therefore, the area is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3\\cdot 6=\\boxed{9}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the area of the triangular region bounded by the two coordinate axes and the line $2x + y = 6$, we first need to determine the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle.\nThe line intersects the x-axis when $y = 0$, so substituting $y = 0$ into the equation $2x + y = 6$ gives $2x = 6$, which simplifies to $x = 3$. Thus, the x-coordinate of the vertex on the x-axis is $(3, 0)$.\n\n## Step 2: Next, we find the y-coordinate of the vertex on the y-axis by setting $x = 0$ in the equation $2x + y = 6$, which gives $y = 6$. So, the y-coordinate of the vertex on the y-axis is $(0, 6)$.\nThe third vertex is at the origin $(0, 0)$ since the region is also bounded by the two coordinate axes.\n\n## Step 3: With the vertices identified as $(0, 0)$, $(3, 0)$, and $(0, 6)$, we can calculate the area of the triangle using the formula for the area of a triangle: $A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height.\nThe base of the triangle is the distance from $(0, 0)$ to $(3, 0)$, which is $3$ units. The height of the triangle is the distance from $(0, 0)$ to $(0, 6)$, which is $6$ units.\n\n## Step 4: Substituting the base and height into the area formula gives $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 18 = 9$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$"
