    "problem": "A puppy and two cats together weigh 24 pounds. The puppy and the larger cat together weigh exactly twice as much as the smaller cat, and the puppy and the smaller cat together weigh exactly the same as the larger cat. How many pounds does the puppy weigh?",
    "solution": "Let the weight of the puppy be $a$, the weight of the smaller cat be $b$, and the weight of the larger cat be $c$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c&=24\\\\\na+c&=2b\\\\\na+b&=c\n\\end{align*} From Equation (2), we have $a=2b-c$. Substituting that into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b+c=24 \\Rightarrow b=8\n\\end{align*} Substituting $a=2b-c$ into Equation (3) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b&=c \\Rightarrow 3b=2c\n\\end{align*} Since $b=8$, $c=\\frac{3}{2}b=12$. Finally, substituting the values of $b$ and $c$ into Equation (1) to solve for $a$, we have $a+8+12=24$, or $a=4$. Thus, the puppy weighs $\\boxed{4}$ pounds.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the variables for the weights of the puppy, the larger cat, and the smaller cat.\nLet's denote the weight of the puppy as $p$, the weight of the larger cat as $L$, and the weight of the smaller cat as $S$.\n\n## Step 2: Set up the equation based on the total weight of the animals.\nWe know that the puppy and two cats together weigh 24 pounds, so we can write the equation: $p + L + S = 24$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the weight comparison between the puppy, the larger cat, and the smaller cat.\nThe puppy and the larger cat together weigh exactly twice as much as the smaller cat. This gives us the equation: $p + L = 2S$.\n\n## Step 4: Set up the equation based on the weight comparison between the puppy, the smaller cat, and the larger cat.\nThe puppy and the smaller cat together weigh exactly the same as the larger cat. This gives us the equation: $p + S = L$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the system of equations.\nFirst, we can express $L$ in terms of $p$ and $S$ from the equation in Step 4: $L = p + S$.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute $L$ from Step 5 into the equation from Step 3.\nSubstituting $L = p + S$ into $p + L = 2S$ gives $p + (p + S) = 2S$, which simplifies to $2p + S = 2S$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $p$ in the simplified equation from Step 6.\nRearranging $2p + S = 2S$ gives $2p = S$.\n\n## Step 8: Substitute $L$ from Step 5 and $S = 2p$ from Step 7 into the equation from Step 2.\nSubstituting $L = p + S$ and $S = 2p$ into $p + L + S = 24$ gives $p + (p + 2p) + 2p = 24$, which simplifies to $p + 3p + 2p = 24$ or $6p = 24$.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for $p$.\nDividing both sides of $6p = 24$ by 6 gives $p = 4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
