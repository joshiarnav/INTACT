    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the midpoint of the line segment from $(2,5)$ to $(4,9)$, we need to average the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates separately.\nThe formula for the midpoint $(x_m, y_m)$ of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $(x_m, y_m) = \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)$. Applying this formula, we get $(x_m, y_m) = \\left(\\frac{2 + 4}{2}, \\frac{5 + 9}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{6}{2}, \\frac{14}{2}\\right) = (3, 7)$.\n\n## Step 2: The line $x+y=b$ intersects the line segment at its midpoint, so we substitute the midpoint $(3, 7)$ into the equation of the line to find $b$.\nThe equation of the line is $x + y = b$. Substituting $x = 3$ and $y = 7$ into the equation gives $3 + 7 = b$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $b$.\n$3 + 7 = b$ simplifies to $10 = b$. Therefore, the value of $b$ is $10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
