    "problem": "Four primes $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ form an increasing arithmetic sequence with $a > 5$ and common difference 6. What is the ones digit of $a$?",
    "solution": "Every prime number greater than 5 has a ones digit of 1, 3, 7, or 9.  For each of these digits, let's add 6, take the resulting ones digit, and repeat the process two more times. We get the following sequences of digits. \\begin{align*}\n1, 7, 3, 9 \\\\\n3, 9, 5, 1 \\\\\n7, 3, 9, 5 \\\\\n9, 5, 1, 7\n\\end{align*} Only the first of these sequences could be the sequence of ones digits of four prime numbers, since each of the other three sequences contains 5.  Therefore, the units digit of $a$ is $\\boxed{1}$. The example $a=11$ shows that there exists such a sequence of consecutive prime numbers.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the conditions given for the primes\nWe are given four primes $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ that form an increasing arithmetic sequence. The common difference between these primes is 6, and $a$ is greater than 5.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the possible ones digits of prime numbers\nPrime numbers greater than 5 can have ones digits of 1, 3, 7, or 9. We need to consider which of these could be the ones digit of $a$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the effect of adding 6 to each possible ones digit\nSince the common difference is 6, we add 6 to each possible ones digit of $a$ and see if the resulting sequence could also be ones digits of prime numbers.\n\n- Starting with 1: $1 + 6 = 7$, $7 + 6 = 13$ (ones digit 3), $3 + 6 = 9$. This sequence is possible because 1, 7, 3, and 9 are all valid ones digits for primes.\n- Starting with 3: $3 + 6 = 9$, $9 + 6 = 15$ (ones digit 5), which is not valid since 5 is not a possible ones digit for a prime in this context (the next number would be 5 + 6 = 11, but the sequence is broken at the second step).\n- Starting with 7: $7 + 6 = 13$ (ones digit 3), $3 + 6 = 9$, $9 + 6 = 15$ (ones digit 5), which again breaks the sequence.\n- Starting with 9: $9 + 6 = 15$ (ones digit 5), which immediately breaks the sequence.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the valid sequence\nFrom step 3, the only valid sequence that maintains possible ones digits for prime numbers when adding 6 is starting with 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
