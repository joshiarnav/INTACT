    "problem": "I have a picture with dimensions $x$ and $y$ (in inches), such that $x$ and $y$ are both integers greater than one. I would like to place this picture in an elongated frame of dimensions $(2x + 3)$ and  $(y+2)$. If I measured the area of the frame to be $34$ square inches, what is the area of the picture in square inches? (Note that by \"the area of the frame,\" we mean the shaded region shown below).

    "solution": "The area of the frame is equal to  \\begin{align*}\n(2x + 3) \\cdot (y+2) - x \\cdot y &= 2xy + 4x + 3y + 6 - xy \\\\\n&= xy + 4x + 3y + 6 \\\\\n&= 34.\n\\end{align*}To apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we add $6$ to both sides of the equation: $$xy + 4x + 3y + 12 = 40,$$so $$(x + 3)(y+4) = 40.$$Considering the factor pairs of 40, we see that the ordered pair $(x+3, y+4)$ must be among $$(1,40),(2,20),(4,10),(5,8),(8,5),(10,4),(20,2),(40,1).$$Solving for $x$ and $y$ for each pair of factors, we find that $(x,y)$ must be among the pairs $$(-2,36), (-1,16), (1,6), (2,4), (5,1), (7,0), (17,-2), (37,-3).$$Of these, only $(x,y) = (2,4)$ satisfy the condition that both $x$ and $y$ are greater than $1$. The area of the picture is thus $x \\times y = \\boxed{8}$ square inches.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information\nThe problem describes a picture with integer dimensions $x$ and $y$ (both greater than 1) that is placed in a frame with dimensions $(2x + 3)$ and $(y+2)$. The area of the frame is given as $34$ square inches, and we need to find the area of the picture.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the area of the frame\nThe area of the frame can be calculated as the total area of the frame minus the area of the picture. This gives us the equation: $(2x + 3) \\cdot (y+2) - x \\cdot y = 34$.\n\n## Step 3: Expand and simplify the equation\nExpanding the equation, we get $2xy + 4x + 3y + 6 - xy = 34$, which simplifies to $xy + 4x + 3y + 6 = 34$.\n\n## Step 4: Rearrange the equation\nRearranging the equation, we get $xy + 4x + 3y = 28$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick\nTo make the equation factorable, we add $12$ to both sides, giving us $xy + 4x + 3y + 12 = 40$. This can be factored into $(x+3)(y+4) = 40$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the factor pairs of 40\nWe need to find the factor pairs of $40$ to determine the possible values of $(x+3)$ and $(y+4)$. The factor pairs of $40$ are $(1,40)$, $(2,20)$, $(4,10)$, and $(5,8)$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the possible values of x and y\nFrom the factor pairs, we can determine the possible values of $x$ and $y$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers greater than $1$, we consider the pairs $(x+3, y+4)$ as $(5,8)$, which gives us $x=2$ and $y=4$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the area of the picture\nUsing the values of $x$ and $y$, we can calculate the area of the picture as $x \\cdot y = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
