    "solution": "Looking at the graph, we can see the line intersects the y-axis at y=1.  This is the y-intercept, which is equal to the value of $b$.  Now, we need to find the slope of the line.  Looking carefully, we can see that for every one unit to the right the line travels, it goes up by two units.  For example, starting from the y-intercept at $(0,1)$, the line passes through a lattice point one unit over and two units up from there, at $(1,3)$.  The rise over run is then $\\frac{2}{1}$, so the slope is 2.  The equation of this line is $y=2x+1$.  Therefore, $mb=2(1)=\\boxed{2}$.",

We can use these points to calculate the slope.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the slope ($m$) of the line using the formula $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the two points.\nGiven points $(-3, -5)$ and $(2, 5)$, the slope $m = \\frac{5 - (-5)}{2 - (-3)} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2$.\n\n## Step 3: Now that we have the slope ($m = 2$), we can use one of the points to find the y-intercept ($b$).\nUsing the point $(-3, -5)$ and the slope-intercept form of the line equation $y = mx + b$, we substitute $m$, $x$, and $y$ to find $b$: $-5 = 2(-3) + b$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $b$.\n$-5 = -6 + b$ implies $b = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $mb$.\nNow that we have $m = 2$ and $b = 1$, we can find $mb = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
