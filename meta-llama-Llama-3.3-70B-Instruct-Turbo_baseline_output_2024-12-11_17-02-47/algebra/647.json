    "problem": "The vertex of the parabola described by the equation $y=-3x^2-30x-81$ is $(m,n)$. What is $n$?",
    "solution": "We will complete the square on the given quadratic expression to find the vertex. Factoring $-3$ from the first two terms, we have \\[y=-3(x^2+10x)-81\\]In order to make the expression inside the parentheses a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(10/2)^2=25$ inside the parentheses. Doing this, we get \\[y=-3(x^2+10x+25-25)-81 = -3(x+5)^2-6\\]The graph of an equation of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ is a parabola with vertex at $(h,k)$, so the vertex of our parabola is at $(-5,-6)$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{-6}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the coefficients in the given quadratic equation\nThe equation given is $y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81$. In the standard form of a quadratic equation, $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, $a = -3$, $b = -30$, and $c = -81$.\n\n## Step 2: Use the formula to find the x-coordinate of the vertex\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola given by $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ can be found using the formula $m = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. Plugging in the values from our equation, we get $m = -\\frac{-30}{2(-3)}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression to find the x-coordinate of the vertex\nSimplifying $m = -\\frac{-30}{2(-3)}$ gives $m = -\\frac{-30}{-6}$, which simplifies further to $m = -5$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the y-coordinate of the vertex\nTo find the y-coordinate of the vertex, $n$, we substitute $m = -5$ back into the original equation: $n = -3(-5)^2 - 30(-5) - 81$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression to find the y-coordinate of the vertex\nSimplifying $n = -3(-5)^2 - 30(-5) - 81$ gives $n = -3(25) + 150 - 81$. This simplifies further to $n = -75 + 150 - 81$.\n\n## Step 6: Continue simplifying to find the value of $n$\nContinuing to simplify, $n = -75 + 150 - 81$ becomes $n = 75 - 81$ after combining the positive and negative terms separately, which then simplifies to $n = -6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-6}$"
