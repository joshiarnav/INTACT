    "solution": "The number of squares in the rectangles is an arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference 1. Thus, at Stage 6, there will be 6 squares. Since each square has an area of $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ square inches, the total area of the rectangle at Stage 6 is $6 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{54}$ square inches.",
