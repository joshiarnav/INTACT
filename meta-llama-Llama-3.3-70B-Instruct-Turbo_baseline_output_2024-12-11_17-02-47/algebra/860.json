    "problem": "The equation $x^2+ ax = -14$ has only integer solutions for $x$. If $a$ is a positive integer, what is the greatest possible value of $a$?",
    "solution": "The left-hand side factors into $x(x+a)=-14$, so $x$ and $x+a$ both divide $-14$. One of the two factors is negative and the other positive, since their product is negative. $x+a>x$, so $x+a>0$ and $x<0$. This leaves 4 possibilities for $x$, since it is negative and divides $-14$ evenly: $-1$, $-2$, $-7$, and $-14$. $x=-1$ gives $x+a=14$ and therefore $a=15$. Similarly, $x=-2$, $x=-7$, and $x=-14$ give $a=9$, $a=9$, and $a=15$, respectively. The largest value for $a$ is thus $\\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Factor the given equation $x^2 + ax = -14$.\nThe equation can be factored as $x(x + a) = -14$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the factors of -14.\nThe factors of -14 are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14$. Since $x$ and $x + a$ must multiply to give -14, we look for pairs of factors of -14.\n\n## Step 3: List all possible pairs of factors of -14.\nThe pairs are: $(1, -14), (-1, 14), (2, -7), (-2, 7)$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $a$ in each pair of factors, considering $x(x + a) = -14$.\nFor $(1, -14)$, we have $x = 1$ and $x + a = -14$, so $a = -15$.\nFor $(-1, 14)$, we have $x = -1$ and $x + a = 14$, so $a = 15$.\nFor $(2, -7)$, we have $x = 2$ and $x + a = -7$, so $a = -9$.\nFor $(-2, 7)$, we have $x = -2$ and $x + a = 7$, so $a = 9$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the positive integer values of $a$.\nFrom the solutions in step 4, the positive integer values of $a$ are $15$ and $9$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the greatest possible value of $a$.\nThe greatest possible value of $a$ from step 5 is $15$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
