    "problem": "How many distinct sequences of four letters can be made from the letters in EQUALS if each sequence must begin with L, end with Q, and no letter can appear in a sequence more than once?",
    "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of letters and the specific conditions given.\nWe are working with the word EQUALS, which has 6 letters: E-Q-U-A-L-S. The conditions for creating sequences are that each sequence must start with L, end with Q, and no letter can be repeated within a sequence.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the letters available for the middle positions.\nSince the sequence must start with L and end with Q, these two letters are fixed in their positions. This leaves us with 4 letters (E, U, A, S) to fill the two middle positions in the sequence.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of distinct sequences for the middle positions.\nFor the first middle position, we have 4 choices (E, U, A, S) since no letter can appear more than once. After selecting one of these letters for the first middle position, we are left with 3 choices for the second middle position.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of distinct sequences.\nTo find the total number of distinct sequences, we multiply the number of choices for the first middle position by the number of choices for the second middle position. So, we have 4 choices for the first position and 3 choices for the second position, giving us 4 * 3 = 12 distinct sequences.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
