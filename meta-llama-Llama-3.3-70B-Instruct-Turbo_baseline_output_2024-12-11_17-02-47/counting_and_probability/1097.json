    "solution": "It is clear that the maximal positive difference is $6 - 1 = 5$. Moreover, we can use 6 to ensure that we can get all positive integer differences up to 5: $6 - 5 = 1$, $6 - 4 = 2$, $6 - 3 = 3$, $6 - 2 = 4$, $6 - 1 = 5$. So, there are $\\boxed{5}$ possible differences.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: List all the possible distinct pairs from the set\nTo find the different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\}$, we first need to list all possible distinct pairs. The pairs are: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the difference for each pair\nNow, we calculate the difference for each pair, considering the absolute difference since order does not matter (e.g., $|1-2| = |2-1|$). The differences are:\n- $|1-2| = 1$\n- $|1-3| = 2$\n- $|1-4| = 3$\n- $|1-5| = 4$\n- $|1-6| = 5$\n- $|2-3| = 1$\n- $|2-4| = 2$\n- $|2-5| = 3$\n- $|2-6| = 4$\n- $|3-4| = 1$\n- $|3-5| = 2$\n- $|3-6| = 3$\n- $|4-5| = 1$\n- $|4-6| = 2$\n- $|5-6| = 1$\n\n## Step 3: Identify the unique positive integers from the differences\nCollecting the unique positive integers from the differences calculated:\n- 1\n- 2\n- 3\n- 4\n- 5\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
