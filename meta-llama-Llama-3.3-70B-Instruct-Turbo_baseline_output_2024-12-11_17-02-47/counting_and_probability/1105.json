    "problem": "In how many ways can 8 people be seated in a row of chairs if three of the people, John, Wilma, and Paul, refuse to sit in three consecutive seats?",
    "solution": "The number of all seating arrangements is $8!$. The number of seating arrangements in which John, Wilma and Paul sit next to each other is $6!\\times 3!$. We can arrive at $6!\\times 3!$ by considering John, Wilma and Paul as one person, arranging the ``six'' people (the JWP super-person plus the 5 other people) first, then arranging John, Wilma and Paul.  Thus the number of acceptable arrangements is $$8!-6!\\times 3!=8\\times 7\\times 6! - 6!\\times 3! = (8\\times 7 - 3!)6! = (50)(720)=\\boxed{36000}.$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to seat 8 people without any restrictions\nThe total number of ways to arrange 8 people in a row is 8!. This is because there are 8 choices for the first seat, 7 choices for the second seat, 6 choices for the third seat, and so on.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to seat 8 people with John, Wilma, and Paul sitting consecutively\nTo calculate the number of ways John, Wilma, and Paul can sit consecutively, we can treat the three of them as a single unit. This means we now have 6 units (the 5 other people plus the unit of John, Wilma, and Paul) to arrange. The 6 units can be arranged in 6! ways. However, within the unit of John, Wilma, and Paul, they can be arranged in 3! ways. So, the total number of ways for John, Wilma, and Paul to sit consecutively is 6! * 3!.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways John, Wilma, and Paul will not sit consecutively\nTo find the number of ways John, Wilma, and Paul will not sit consecutively, we subtract the number of ways they can sit consecutively from the total number of ways to seat 8 people without any restrictions. This gives us 8! - (6! * 3!).\n\n## Step 4: Compute the values\n8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40320.\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\nSo, 6! * 3! = 720 * 6 = 4320.\nTherefore, 8! - (6! * 3!) = 40320 - 4320 = 36000.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36000}$"
