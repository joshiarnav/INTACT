    "problem": "Two standard dice are rolled. What is the expected number of 1's obtained? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability of rolling a number other than 1 on one die is $\\frac{5}{6}$, so the probability of rolling zero 1's on two dice is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{36}$. The probability of rolling a 1 on one die is $\\frac{1}{6}$, so the probability of rolling 1's on two dice (for a total of two 1's) is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{36}$. Since the only other possibility is rolling exactly one 1, the probability of rolling one 1 is $1-\\frac{25}{36}-\\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{10}{36}$. We find the expected number of 1's to be $E = \\frac{1}{36} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{10}{36} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{25}{36} \\cdot 0 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the possible outcomes for rolling two standard dice\nEach die has 6 faces, so when rolling two dice, there are a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of outcomes that result in zero 1's\nTo get zero 1's, neither of the dice can land on 1. So, each die has 5 faces that are not 1, resulting in 5 * 5 = 25 outcomes where no 1's are obtained.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of outcomes that result in one 1\nThere are two scenarios for getting exactly one 1: the first die lands on 1 and the second does not, or the second die lands on 1 and the first does not. For the first scenario, there is 1 face on the first die that is a 1 and 5 faces on the second die that are not 1, resulting in 1 * 5 = 5 outcomes. The same applies to the second scenario, resulting in another 5 outcomes. Thus, there are a total of 5 + 5 = 10 outcomes where exactly one 1 is obtained.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of outcomes that result in two 1's\nTo get two 1's, both dice must land on 1. There is only 1 face on each die that is a 1, resulting in 1 * 1 = 1 outcome where two 1's are obtained.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the expected number of 1's obtained\nThe expected number of 1's is calculated by multiplying the number of outcomes for each scenario by the number of 1's in that scenario and then summing these products, finally dividing by the total number of outcomes. The formula for expected value E is: E = (0 * number of outcomes with 0 1's + 1 * number of outcomes with 1 1 + 2 * number of outcomes with 2 1's) / total number of outcomes. Substituting the values: E = (0 * 25 + 1 * 10 + 2 * 1) / 36.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the calculation for the expected value\nE = (0 + 10 + 2) / 36 = 12 / 36 = 1 / 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$"
