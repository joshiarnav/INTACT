    "problem": "The probability that Kim has a math test today is $\\frac{4}{7}$. What is the probability that Kim does not have a math test today? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that Kim does not have a math test is equal to one minus the probability she does have a math test. So, the probability of not having a math test is $1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the given probability of Kim having a math test\nThe probability that Kim has a math test today is $\\frac{4}{7}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability of Kim not having a math test\nTo find the probability that Kim does not have a math test, we subtract the probability of her having a test from 1, since the sum of the probability of an event happening and not happening is 1.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the formula for the probability of an event not happening\nThe formula is $P(\\text{not having a test}) = 1 - P(\\text{having a test})$. Substituting the given probability: $P(\\text{not having a test}) = 1 - \\frac{4}{7}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator for 1, which is $\\frac{7}{7}$. So, $P(\\text{not having a test}) = \\frac{7}{7} - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{7-4}{7} = \\frac{3}{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$"
