As the diagram below illustrates, these are all the points in the square except those in the triangle with vertices (2,1), (2,2), and (1,2).\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(.7);\n\ndraw((-.1,0)--(3,0),Arrow);\ndraw((0,-.1)--(0,4),Arrow);\n\ndraw((0,2)--(2,2)--(2,0));\ndraw((-.5,3.5)--(2.5,.5),dashed,Arrows);\n\nfill((0,0)--(0,2)--(1,2)--(2,1)--(2,0)--cycle,gray(.7));\n\nlabel(\"(1,2)\",(1,2),NE);\nlabel(\"(2,2)\",(2,2),NE);\nlabel(\"(2,1)\",(2,1),NE);\n[/asy]\n\nSince this is a right triangle whose sides both of length 1, its area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1^2 = 1/2$.

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and constraints\nThe problem asks for the probability that a randomly chosen point $(x, y)$ inside a square with vertices $(0,0)$, $(0,2)$, $(2,2)$, and $(2,0)$ satisfies the condition $x + y < 3$. To solve this, we first need to visualize the square and the region where $x + y < 3$.\n\n## Step 2: Visualize the square and the condition $x + y < 3$\nThe square has side length 2, so it extends from 0 to 2 on both the x-axis and y-axis. The condition $x + y < 3$ describes a region in the plane. We can rewrite this inequality as $y < -x + 3$, which is the equation of a line with slope -1 and y-intercept 3. The region satisfying $x + y < 3$ is below this line.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the area where $x + y < 3$ within the square\nTo find the area where $x + y < 3$ within the square, we need to identify the points where the line $y = -x + 3$ intersects the square. This line intersects the x-axis at (3,0), which is outside our square, and intersects the y-axis at (0,3), also outside the square. However, it does intersect the top side of the square. To find this intersection, we set $y = 2$ (since the top side of the square is at $y = 2$) and solve for $x$: $2 = -x + 3 \\Rightarrow x = 1$. So, the line intersects the top side of the square at $(1, 2)$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the region where $x + y < 3$\nThe region where $x + y < 3$ within the square includes the entire square except for the triangle formed by the points $(1,2)$, $(2,2)$, and $(2,1)$. The area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$. The total area of the square is $2 \\times 2 = 4$. Therefore, the area where $x + y < 3$ is $4 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability\nThe probability that a randomly chosen point satisfies $x + y < 3$ is the ratio of the area where $x + y < 3$ to the total area of the square. So, the probability is $\\frac{\\frac{7}{2}}{4} = \\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$"
