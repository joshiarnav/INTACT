    "problem": "After a gymnastics meet, each gymnast shook hands once with every gymnast on every team (except herself). Afterwards, a coach came down and only shook hands with each gymnast from her own team. There were a total of 281 handshakes. What is the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in?",
    "solution": "The number of gymnasts is some integer $n$, so that the number of gymnast-gymnast handshakes is ${n \\choose 2}$ for some $n$. Also, the coach must participate in an integer $k<n$ number of handshakes. So, ${n \\choose 2} + k = 281$. If we want to minimize $k$, we need the maximal $n$ such that ${n \\choose 2} \\le 281$, which implies $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 281$ or $n^2 - n - 562 \\le 0 $. So, the maximal $n$ is 24. So, $k = 281 - {24 \\choose 2} = 281 - 12 \\cdot 23 = 281 - 276 = \\boxed{5}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the total number of handshakes\nThere were a total of 281 handshakes, including those between gymnasts and those between the coach and gymnasts.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of handshakes between gymnasts\nLet's denote the number of gymnasts as $n$. Each gymnast shook hands with every other gymnast once, resulting in $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ handshakes.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the coach's handshakes\nThe coach only shook hands with gymnasts from her own team. If the coach's team has $m$ gymnasts, the coach participated in $m$ handshakes.\n\n## Step 4: Set up an equation for the total handshakes\nThe sum of handshakes between gymnasts and handshakes involving the coach equals the total number of handshakes: $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + m = 281$.\n\n## Step 5: Minimize the coach's handshakes\nTo minimize $m$, we should maximize $n$ such that $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ is as close as possible to 281, but still less than 281, since $m$ must be a positive integer.\n\n## Step 6: Find the maximum value of $n$\nWe test values of $n$ to find when $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ approaches 281 but does not exceed it. For $n = 24$, $\\frac{24 \\cdot 23}{2} = 276$, which is the closest we can get to 281 without exceeding it.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the minimum number of handshakes for the coach\nGiven $n = 24$, we have $\\frac{24 \\cdot 23}{2} = 276$ handshakes between gymnasts. Thus, $276 + m = 281$, so $m = 281 - 276 = 5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
