    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the factorial of 7\nTo find the factorial of 7, we need to multiply all positive integers up to 7. This means $7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the factorial of 5\nTo find the factorial of 5, we need to multiply all positive integers up to 5. This means $5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the square of 5!\nTo find the square of $5!$, we need to multiply $5!$ by itself. This means $(5!)^2 = 120 \\times 120 = 14400$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the prime factorization of 7!\nThe prime factorization of $7!$ is $2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the prime factorization of (5!)^2\nThe prime factorization of $(5!)^2$ is $(2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5)^2 = 2^6 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the common prime factors\nThe common prime factors between $7!$ and $(5!)^2$ are $2$, $3$, and $5$. We take the minimum exponent for each common prime factor: $2^4$ (from $7!$), $3^2$ (common to both), and $5$ (from $7!$).\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD)\nThe GCD of $7!$ and $(5!)^2$ is the product of the common prime factors raised to their minimum exponents: $2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 = 16 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 720$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{720}$"
