    "problem": "How many positive multiples of $7$ that are less than $1000$ end with the digit $3$?",
    "solution": "Listing the first 10 multiples of 7, which are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, we see that the only positive multiples of 7 that end in 3 are those that are the product of 7 and a number that ends in 9.  Therefore, the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3 are $7\\cdot 9 = 63$, $7\\cdot 19= 133$, $7\\cdot 29 = 203$, . . .  Notice that we can get from each to the next by adding $7\\cdot 10 = 70$, so our multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 are 63, 133, 203, . . ., 903, 973.  The last one is 910 more than the first. Since $910/70=13$, we see that we have taken 13 steps of 70 to get from the first number in the list to the last. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{14}$ numbers in the list.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the pattern of multiples of 7 that end with the digit 3\nTo find the positive multiples of 7 that end with the digit 3, we first observe the pattern of multiples of 7 and identify which ones end in 3.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the first multiple of 7 that ends with the digit 3\nThe first multiple of 7 that ends in 3 is 63, because 7 * 9 = 63.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the sequence of multiples of 7 that end with the digit 3\nMultiples of 7 that end in 3 follow the sequence 63, 133, 203, 273, 343, 413, 483, 553, 623, 693, 763, 833, 903, 973, and so on, where each term increases by 70 (since 7 * 10 = 70).\n\n## Step 4: Find the number of multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3\nTo find how many of these multiples are less than 1000, we can set up an inequality to solve for n, where the nth term is less than 1000. The general term can be represented as 63 + 70(n-1) < 1000.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the inequality\n63 + 70(n-1) < 1000. Simplifying, we get 70n - 70 + 63 < 1000, which further simplifies to 70n - 7 < 1000. Adding 7 to both sides gives 70n < 1007. Dividing by 70 gives n < 1007 / 70.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the value of n\nn < 1007 / 70. Calculating 1007 / 70 gives approximately 14.38. Since n must be an integer (as it represents the number of terms), we consider n \u2264 14, because the 14th term is still less than 1000.\n\n## Step 7: Confirm the number of terms\nCounting from the first term (63) to the 14th term (which is 63 + 70*13 = 973), we confirm that there are indeed 14 terms that meet the criteria.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$"
