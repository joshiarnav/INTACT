    "problem": "A Senate committee has 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats.  In how many ways can we form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats?",
    "solution": "There are 8 Republicans and 3 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ ways to choose the Republicans.  There are 6 Democrats and 2 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose the Democrats.  So there are $56 \\times 15 = \\boxed{840}$ ways to choose the subcommittee.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8 Republicans.\nTo calculate the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8, we use the combination formula $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial. For the Republicans, this becomes $C(8, 3) = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8 Republicans using the combination formula.\nWe calculate $C(8, 3) = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3!5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{336}{6} = 56$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to choose 2 Democrats from 6 Democrats.\nUsing the same combination formula for the Democrats, we get $C(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 Democrats from 6 Democrats using the combination formula.\nWe calculate $C(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6!}{2!4!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats.\nTo find the total number of ways to form the subcommittee, we multiply the number of ways to choose the Republicans by the number of ways to choose the Democrats: $56 \\times 15 = 840$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{840}$"
