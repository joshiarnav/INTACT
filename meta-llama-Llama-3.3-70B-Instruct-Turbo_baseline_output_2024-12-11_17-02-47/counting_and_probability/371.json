    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable but the boxes are?",
    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of balls in the different boxes.\n\nThere are $3$ ways to arrange the balls as $(5,0,0)$ (specifically, box 1 can have 5, box 2 can have 5, box 3 can have 5).\n\nThere are $3! = 6$ to arrange $(4,1,0)$ and $3! = 6$ ways to arrange $(3,2,0)$; in each case, we must choose one of the 3 boxes to have the largest number of balls, and also one of the remaining two boxes to be left empty.\n\nHowever, there are only $3$ ways to arrange $(3,1,1)$, and $3$ ways to arrange $(2,2,1)$; in each case, we must choose one box to have the `different' number of balls (3 in the $(3,1,1)$ case and 1 in the $(2,2,1)$ case).\n\nThis gives a total of $3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = \\boxed{21}$ arrangements.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks for the number of ways to distribute 5 indistinguishable balls into 3 distinguishable boxes.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the method for solving\nSince the balls are indistinguishable, we can use a stars and bars approach to solve this problem. This method involves counting the number of ways to arrange stars (representing the balls) and bars (representing the divisions between the boxes).\n\n## Step 3: Apply the stars and bars method\nWe have 5 stars (for the 5 balls) and 2 bars (to divide the balls into 3 groups representing the boxes). The total number of arrangements can be found by considering the placement of the 2 bars among the 5 stars and the spaces between, before, and after them. This is equivalent to choosing 2 positions out of 7 (5 stars + 2 bars) to place the bars.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of arrangements\nThe number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 7 is given by the combination formula $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $k$ is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, the product of all positive integers up to that number. Here, $n = 7$ and $k = 2$, so the calculation is $C(7, 2) = \\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!}$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the calculation\n$C(7, 2) = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 5!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{42}{2} = 21$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$"
