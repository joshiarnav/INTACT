    "solution": "The number of pairs of neighbors for Cara actually has nothing to do with the shape of the table she is sitting at. That is, all that matters is that she has 5 friends and two of them will be her neighbors. There are ${5 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{10}$ pairs of friends that she can thus sit between.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  First, let's analyze the problem and understand what is being asked. We have Cara sitting at a circular table with her five friends.\n## Step 2:  The question asks for the number of different possible pairs of people that Cara could be sitting between.\n## Step 3:  To approach this, we need to consider the total number of ways Cara can be seated between two of her five friends.\n## Step 4:  Since the table is circular, the seating arrangement is considered the same if everyone shifts their position in the same direction, so the absolute positions of the individuals do not matter.\n## Step 5:  We are essentially choosing 2 friends out of the 5 to sit on either side of Cara.\n## Step 6:  This can be calculated using combinations, where the order of selection does not matter, denoted as $\\binom{n}{r}$, which represents the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items without regard to the order of selection.\n## Step 7:  Here, we want to choose 2 friends from the 5, so the number of possible pairs is given by $\\binom{5}{2}$.\n## Step 8:  The formula for combinations is $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n!$ denotes the factorial of n.\n## Step 9:  Substituting the values, we get $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, there are 10 different possible pairs of people that Cara could be sitting between.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
