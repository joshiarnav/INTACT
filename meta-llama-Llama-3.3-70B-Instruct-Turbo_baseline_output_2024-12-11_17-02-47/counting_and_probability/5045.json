    "problem": "Each of the $2001$ students at a high school studies either Spanish or French, and some study both. The number who study Spanish is between $80$ percent and $85$ percent of the school population, and the number who study French is between $30$ percent and $40$ percent. Let $m$ be the smallest number of students who could study both languages, and let $M$ be the largest number of students who could study both languages. Find $M-m$.\n",
    "solution": "Let $S$ be the percent of people who study Spanish, $F$ be the number of people who study French, and let $S \\cup F$ be the number of students who study both. Then $\\left\\lceil 80\\% \\cdot 2001 \\right\\rceil = 1601 \\le S \\le \\left\\lfloor 85\\% \\cdot 2001 \\right\\rfloor = 1700$, and $\\left\\lceil 30\\% \\cdot 2001 \\right\\rceil = 601 \\le F \\le \\left\\lfloor 40\\% \\cdot 2001 \\right\\rfloor = 800$. By the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion,\n\\[S+F- S \\cap F = S \\cup F = 2001\\]\nFor $m = S \\cap F$ to be smallest, $S$ and $F$ must be minimized.\n\\[1601 + 601 - m = 2001 \\Longrightarrow m = 201\\]\nFor $M = S \\cap F$ to be largest, $S$ and $F$ must be maximized.\n\\[1700 + 800 - M = 2001 \\Longrightarrow M = 499\\]\nTherefore, the answer is $M - m = 499 - 201 = \\boxed{298}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the minimum number of students studying Spanish\nTo find the minimum number of students studying Spanish, we need to calculate $80\\%$ of $2001$. This gives us $0.8 \\times 2001 = 1600.8$, but since the number of students must be an integer, the minimum number of students studying Spanish is $1601$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the maximum number of students studying Spanish\nTo find the maximum number of students studying Spanish, we calculate $85\\%$ of $2001$. This gives us $0.85 \\times 2001 = 1700.85$, but again, the number of students must be an integer. Therefore, the maximum number of students studying Spanish is $1700$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the minimum number of students studying French\nTo find the minimum number of students studying French, we calculate $30\\%$ of $2001$. This gives us $0.3 \\times 2001 = 600.3$, but the number of students must be an integer. So, the minimum number of students studying French is $601$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the maximum number of students studying French\nTo find the maximum number of students studying French, we calculate $40\\%$ of $2001$. This gives us $0.4 \\times 2001 = 800.4$, but the number of students must be an integer. Therefore, the maximum number of students studying French is $800$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the range for the number of students studying both languages\nLet $S$ be the number of students studying Spanish, $F$ be the number of students studying French, and $S \\cap F$ be the number of students studying both. We know that $S + F - S \\cap F = 2001$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the smallest number of students who could study both languages ($m$)\nThe smallest value of $S \\cap F$ occurs when $S$ is minimized and $F$ is minimized. So, $m = 1601 + 601 - 2001 = 201$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the largest number of students who could study both languages ($M$)\nThe largest value of $S \\cap F$ occurs when $S$ is maximized and $F$ is maximized. So, $M = 1700 + 800 - 2001 = 499$.\n\n## Step 8: Find $M - m$\nTo find the difference between the largest and smallest number of students who could study both languages, we calculate $M - m = 499 - 201$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{298}$"
