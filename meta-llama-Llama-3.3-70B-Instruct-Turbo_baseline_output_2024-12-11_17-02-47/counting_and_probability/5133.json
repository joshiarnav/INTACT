    "problem": "How many 10-digit positive integers have all digits either 1 or 2, and have two consecutive 1's?\n",
    "solution": "We take as our universe the set of 10-digit integers whose digits are all either 1 or 2, of which there are $2^{10}$, and we count the complement. The complement is the set of 10-digit positive integers composed of the digits 1 and 2 with no two consecutive 1s. Counting such numbers is a popular combinatorial problem: we approach it via a recursion.\nThere are two \"good\" one-digit numbers (1 and 2) and three good two-digit numbers (12, 21 and 22). Each such $n$-digit number is formed either by gluing \"2\" on to the end of a good $(n - 1)$-digit number or by gluing \"21\" onto the end of a good $(n - 2)$-digit number. This is a bijection between the good $n$-digit numbers and the union of the good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. Thus, the number of good $n$-digit numbers is the sum of the number of good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. The resulting recursion is exactly that of the Fibonacci numbers with initial values $F_1 = 2$ and $F_2 = 3$.\nThus, our final answer is $2^{10} - F_{10} = 1024 - 144 = \\boxed{880}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and what is being asked\nWe need to find the number of 10-digit positive integers that have all digits as either 1 or 2 and specifically have two consecutive 1's.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the total possible number of 10-digit integers with digits 1 or 2\nSince each digit can be either 1 or 2, for a 10-digit number, there are 2 possibilities for each digit, giving us a total of $2^{10}$ possible numbers.\n\n## Step 3: Find the number of 10-digit integers with no consecutive 1's\nTo solve the given problem, we can use the complement approach. Let's find the number of 10-digit integers with no consecutive 1's and then subtract this from the total number of possible 10-digit integers with digits 1 or 2.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the complement approach using recursion or dynamic programming\nLet $a_n$ be the number of n-digit integers with no consecutive 1's. We can derive a recursive relation for $a_n$ by considering how an n-digit number is formed from an (n-1)-digit number.\n\n## Step 5: Derive the recursive relation for $a_n$\nFor an n-digit number, if the last digit is 2, it can be appended to any (n-1)-digit number without creating consecutive 1's, giving us $a_{n-1}$ possibilities. If the last digit is 1, it must be appended to an (n-1)-digit number that ends in 2 to avoid consecutive 1's. The number of (n-1)-digit numbers that end in 2 is $a_{n-2}$ because we can append a 2 to any (n-2)-digit number. Thus, $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the initial conditions for $a_n$\nThe initial conditions are $a_1 = 2$ (since a 1-digit number can be either 1 or 2) and $a_2 = 3$ (since a 2-digit number can be 11, 12, or 22 to not have consecutive 1's, but we also include 21 as it doesn't have consecutive 1's, making it 3 possibilities).\n\n## Step 7: Calculate $a_{10}$ using the recursive relation or identify the sequence\nThe sequence defined by $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ with initial conditions $a_1 = 2$ and $a_2 = 3$ is a form of the Fibonacci sequence but with different starting values. We need to calculate $a_{10}$ using this relation.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the terms of the sequence up to $a_{10}$\nFollowing the recursive relation:\n- $a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 3 + 2 = 5$\n- $a_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 5 + 3 = 8$\n- $a_5 = a_4 + a_3 = 8 + 5 = 13$\n- $a_6 = a_5 + a_4 = 13 + 8 = 21$\n- $a_7 = a_6 + a_5 = 21 + 13 = 34$\n- $a_8 = a_7 + a_6 = 34 + 21 = 55$\n- $a_9 = a_8 + a_7 = 55 + 34 = 89$\n- $a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 = 89 + 55 = 144$\n\n## Step 9: Subtract $a_{10}$ from the total number of possible 10-digit integers to find the number of integers with two consecutive 1's\nThe total number of 10-digit integers with digits 1 or 2 is $2^{10} = 1024$. The number of 10-digit integers with no consecutive 1's is $a_{10} = 144$. Therefore, the number of 10-digit integers with two consecutive 1's is $1024 - 144 = 880$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{880}$"
