    "problem": "A Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans. Assuming all politicians are distinguishable, in how many ways can they sit around a circular table without restrictions?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "There are 10 people to place, so we can place them in $10!$ ways, but this counts each valid arrangement 10 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement).  So the number of ways to seat them is $\\dfrac{10!}{10} = 9! = \\boxed{362,\\!880}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to arrange 10 distinguishable politicians in a line.\nThe total number of ways to arrange 10 distinguishable politicians in a line is given by 10!, which is the factorial of 10.\n\n## Step 2: Account for the fact that the table is circular.\nSince the table is circular, we must divide the total number of linear arrangements by the number of rotations that result in the same seating arrangement. For a circular table, there are 10 possible rotations (each politician can be rotated to the top position).\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of distinct seating arrangements.\nThe number of distinct seating arrangements is given by the total number of linear arrangements divided by the number of rotations. This is calculated as 10! / 10.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the calculation.\n10! / 10 = 9! = 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the multiplication to find the final answer.\n9 * 8 = 72, 72 * 7 = 504, 504 * 6 = 3024, 3024 * 5 = 15120, 15120 * 4 = 60480, 60480 * 3 = 181440, 181440 * 2 = 362880, 362880 * 1 = 362880.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{362880}$"
