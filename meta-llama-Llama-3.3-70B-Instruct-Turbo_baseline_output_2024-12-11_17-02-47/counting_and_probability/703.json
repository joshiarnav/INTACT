    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the type of problem\nThis is a combination problem, because the order in which George chooses the colors does not matter.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the number of items to choose from and the number of items to choose\nGeorge has 7 colors to choose from, and he wants to choose 2 colors.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the combination formula\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items to choose from, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of combinations\nSubstitute the values into the formula: C(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!).\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the factorial expressions\n7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040, 2! = 2 * 1 = 2, and (7-2)! = 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n\n## Step 6: Plug the simplified factorials into the formula\nC(7, 2) = 5040 / (2 * 120).\n\n## Step 7: Perform the arithmetic\nC(7, 2) = 5040 / 240 = 21.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$"
