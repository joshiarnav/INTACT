    "solution": "Since there are twelve steps between $(0,0)$ and $(5,7)$, $A$ and $B$ can meet only after they have each moved six steps. The possible meeting places are $P_{0} = (0,6)$, $P_{1} = (1,5)$, $P_{2} = (2,4)$, $P_{3}=(3,3)$, $P_{4} = (4,2)$, and $P_{5} =\n(5,1)$. Let $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ denote the number of paths to $P_{i}$ from $(0,0)$ and $(5,7)$, respectively. Since $A$ has to take $i$ steps to the right and $B$ has to take $i+1$ steps down, the number of ways in which $A$ and $B$ can meet at $P_{i}$ is $$a_{i}\\cdot b_{i} = \\binom{6}{i} \\binom{6}{i+1}. $$Since $A$ and $B$ can each take $2^{6}$ paths in six steps, the probability that they meet  is \\begin{align*}\n&\\sum_{i = 0}^{5}\\displaystyle\\left ( \\frac{a_{i}}{2^{6}}\\displaystyle\\right)\\displaystyle\\left( \\frac{b_{i}}{2^{6}} \\displaystyle\\right) \\\\\n& \\qquad = \\frac{\\binom{6}{0}\\binom{6}{1} + \\binom{6}{1}\\binom{6}{2} + \\binom{6}{2}\\binom{6}{3}\n+ \\binom{6}{3}\\binom{6}{4}+ \\binom{6}{4}\\binom{6}{5} + \\binom{6}{5}\\binom{6}{6}}{2^{12}}\\\\\n& \\qquad = \\frac{99}{512} \\\\\n& \\qquad \\approx \\boxed{0.20}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the movement of objects A and B\nObject A starts at (0,0) and can move either right or up with equal probability. Object B starts at (5,7) and can move either left or down with equal probability.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the possible meeting points\nFor objects A and B to meet, they must be at the same point after the same number of steps. Since each step is of length one, the total number of steps for A and B to meet must be equal to the sum of the horizontal and vertical distances between their starting points. The starting points are (0,0) and (5,7), so the total distance is 5 (horizontal) + 7 (vertical) = 12 steps.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of paths for object A to reach a meeting point\nSince object A must move 5 steps to the right and 7 steps up to reach a potential meeting point (in any order), this can be represented by choosing 5 out of 12 steps to be \"right\" (and the rest will be \"up\"). The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient C(12, 5).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of paths for object B to reach a meeting point\nSimilarly, object B must move 5 steps to the left and 7 steps down. This is equivalent to choosing 5 out of 12 steps to be \"left\" (and the rest will be \"down\"). The number of ways to do this is also C(12, 5).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of possible paths for both objects\nEach object has 2 choices (right/up for A, left/down for B) for each of the 12 steps, resulting in 2^12 possible paths for each object.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of meeting at any point\nThe probability that A and B meet is the number of successful outcomes (where they meet) divided by the total number of outcomes. The successful outcomes are the product of the number of paths for A and B to reach a meeting point, which is C(12, 5) * C(12, 5). The total number of outcomes is 2^12 * 2^12.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate C(12, 5)\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5! * (12-5)!) = 792.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the probability\nThe probability = (C(12, 5) * C(12, 5)) / (2^12 * 2^12) = (792 * 792) / (2^24).\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the probability calculation\nCalculating the numerator: 792 * 792 = 627,264. The denominator is 2^24 = 16,777,216. Thus, the probability = 627,264 / 16,777,216.\n\n## Step 10: Perform the division to find the probability\nProbability \u2248 0.0374.\n\n## Step 11: Compare the calculated probability to the given options\nThe calculated probability (approximately 0.0374) is closest to option A (0.10) among the given choices, although it's actually lower. However, since the question asks for the closest and given the options provided, the closest higher option is 0.10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.2}$"
