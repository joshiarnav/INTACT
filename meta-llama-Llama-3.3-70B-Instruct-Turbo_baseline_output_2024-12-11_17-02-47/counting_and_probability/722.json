    "problem": "Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace?",
    "solution": "We have two cases because if the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$, it could be an ace or not be an ace.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{3}{51} = \\dfrac{1}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the three remaining aces, which gives a probability of $\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot \\dfrac{1}{17} = \\dfrac{1}{884}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{12}{52} = \\dfrac{3}{13}$ chance that a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the ace is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{4}{51}$ chance that an ace is drawn second, giving a $\\dfrac{3}{13}\\cdot \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{4}{221}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nSo the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\\dfrac{1}{884} + \\dfrac{4}{221} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}$.\n\nNotice that we can avoid some of the large denominators above by organizing this computation as follows: $$\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{3}{51}+\\dfrac{12}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{1\\cdot 3+12\\cdot 4}{52\\cdot 51} = \\dfrac{51}{52\\cdot 51}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}.$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to choose the first card\nThere are 52 cards in a standard deck, so there are 52 ways to choose the first card.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$\nSince there are 13 $\\diamondsuit$ cards in the deck, the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ is $\\frac{13}{52}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the total number of ways to choose the second card\nAfter the first card is chosen, there are 51 cards remaining in the deck, so there are 51 ways to choose the second card.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the probability that the second card is an ace\nThere are two scenarios to consider: the first card is the ace of $\\diamondsuit$, and the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ but not the ace.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of the first scenario\nThe probability that the first card is the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is $\\frac{1}{52}$. If this happens, there are 3 aces remaining in the deck, so the probability that the second card is an ace is $\\frac{3}{51}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of the second scenario\nThe probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ but not the ace is $\\frac{12}{52}$. If this happens, there are 4 aces remaining in the deck, so the probability that the second card is an ace is $\\frac{4}{51}$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the overall probability\nTo find the overall probability, we need to consider both scenarios: $\\left(\\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{12}{52} \\times \\frac{4}{51}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the expression\n$\\left(\\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{12}{52} \\times \\frac{4}{51}\\right) = \\frac{3}{2652} + \\frac{48}{2652} = \\frac{51}{2652}$.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the fraction\n$\\frac{51}{2652} = \\frac{1}{52}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{52}}$"
