    "problem": "Seven people arrive to dinner, but the circular table only seats six.  If two seatings such that one is a rotation of the other are considered the same, then in how many different ways can we choose six people and seat them at the table?",
    "solution": "There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing.  To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person.  This suggests that there are $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people.  However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count.  Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table.  There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the number of ways to choose 6 people out of 7.\nTo find the number of ways to choose 6 people out of 7, we use the combination formula, which is given by: $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Here, n = 7 (total people) and k = 6 (people to be chosen).\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of combinations for choosing 6 people out of 7.\nApplying the combination formula: $C(7, 6) = \\frac{7!}{6!(7-6)!} = \\frac{7!}{6!1!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6!}{6!} = 7$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of ways to arrange 6 people around a circular table.\nThe number of ways to arrange n distinct objects in a circle is (n-1)!. Here, we have 6 people, so the number of arrangements is (6-1)! = 5!.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of arrangements for 6 people around the circular table.\n5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of different ways to choose and seat the people.\nThe total number of ways is the product of the number of ways to choose 6 people and the number of ways to arrange them around the table: 7 \u00d7 120.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final product.\n7 \u00d7 120 = 840.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{840}$"
