    "solution": "We consider the unordered pairs, or sets, of spins for which the difference of the numbers are greater than or equal to 3, or those games which Jane loses. These can only occur in the sets $\\{1, 4\\}$, $\\{1, 5 \\}$ or $\\{ 2, 5 \\}$. Each of these unordered pairs can occur in 2 orderings (depending on whether Jane or her brother spins each number). So, there are $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ losing combinations out of $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ for Jane. So, her winning probability is $1 - \\frac{6}{25} = \\boxed{\\frac{19}{25}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes when Jane and her brother each spin the spinner once.\nSince each spinner has 5 congruent sectors, there are a total of $5 \\times 5 = 25$ possible outcomes when they both spin the spinner.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the winning conditions for Jane.\nJane wins if the non-negative difference of their numbers is less than 3. This means she will win in the following cases: (1) when the numbers are the same, (2) when the difference is 1, and (3) when the difference is 2.\n\n## Step 3: Enumerate the winning outcomes for Jane based on the conditions identified.\nFor the numbers being the same, the winning outcomes are (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), which gives us 5 outcomes.\nFor a difference of 1, the winning outcomes are (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,3), (4,5), (5,4), which gives us 8 outcomes.\nFor a difference of 2, the winning outcomes are (1,3), (3,1), (2,4), (4,2), (3,5), (5,3), which gives us 6 outcomes.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of winning outcomes for Jane.\nThe total number of winning outcomes for Jane is $5 + 8 + 6 = 19$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability that Jane wins.\nThe probability that Jane wins is the total number of winning outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability is $\\frac{19}{25}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{19}{25}}$"
