    "problem": "Define a $\\it{good\\ word}$ as a sequence of letters that consists only of the letters $A$, $B$, and $C$ --- some of these letters may not appear in the sequence --- and in which $A$ is never immediately followed by $B$, $B$ is never immediately followed by $C$, and $C$ is never immediately followed by $A$. How many seven-letter good words are there?",
    "solution": "There are three choices for the first letter and two choices for each subsequent letter, so there are $3\\cdot2^{n-1}\\ n$-letter good words.  Substitute $n=7$ to find there are $3\\cdot2^6=\\boxed{192}$ seven-letter good words.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem and understand the constraints\nWe need to find the number of seven-letter good words that consist only of the letters $A$, $B$, and $C$, with the constraints that $A$ is never immediately followed by $B$, $B$ is never immediately followed by $C$, and $C$ is never immediately followed by $A$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of possibilities for the first letter\nSince the first letter can be any of $A$, $B$, or $C$, there are 3 possibilities for the first letter.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of possibilities for the subsequent letters\nFor each subsequent letter, there are 2 possibilities because once a letter is chosen, there is only one letter that cannot immediately follow it. For example, if the current letter is $A$, then the next letter can be either $A$ or $C$, but not $B$. This pattern applies to all subsequent letters.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of seven-letter good words\nTo find the total number of seven-letter good words, we multiply the number of possibilities for the first letter by the number of possibilities for each subsequent letter. Since there are 6 subsequent letters, we raise 2 to the power of 6 to account for the possibilities of these letters.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the final answer\nThe total number of seven-letter good words is $3 \\times 2^6 = 3 \\times 64 = 192$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{192}$"
