    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Draw the altitude from point C to line AB and denote the foot of the altitude as E.\nDrawing the altitude from C to AB will help us apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangles CEB and CED.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize that triangle CEB and triangle CED are right triangles.\nSince CE is perpendicular to AB, triangles CEB and CED are right triangles, which allows us to use the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle CEB to find the length of BE.\nGiven that AC = BC = 7 and AB = 2, and knowing that CE bisects AB because triangle ABC is isosceles, we can determine the lengths of AE and BE. Since AB = 2, AE = BE = 1 because CE is the altitude and the triangle is isosceles.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the length of CE using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle CEB.\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem in triangle CEB, we have $CE^2 + BE^2 = BC^2$. Thus, $CE^2 + 1^2 = 7^2$. Therefore, $CE^2 = 48$ and $CE = \\sqrt{48}$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle CED to find the length of DE.\nGiven that CD = 8 and CE = $\\sqrt{48}$, and knowing that $DE = BD + BE$, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem: $CE^2 + DE^2 = CD^2$. Since we already know $CE^2 = 48$, we have $48 + DE^2 = 8^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for DE.\n$DE^2 = 64 - 48 = 16$, so $DE = \\sqrt{16} = 4$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate BD using the lengths of DE and BE.\nSince $DE = BD + BE$ and we know $DE = 4$ and $BE = 1$, we can solve for BD: $BD = DE - BE = 4 - 1 = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
