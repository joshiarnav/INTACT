    "problem": "A square and a circle intersect so that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle. What is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "Drawing a diagram and adding $OM$ perpendicular to $AD$, we get\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-1,1);\nB=(1,1);\nC=(1,-1);\nD=(-1,-1);\nE=(-1,-.577);\nF=(-1,.577);\nM=(-1,0);\ndraw(circle(O,1.155));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--A);\ndraw(F--O);\ndraw(O--E);\ndraw(O--M);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"F\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, dir(0));\nlabel(\"M\", M, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (F+O)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (E+O)/2, SE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", M, W);\n[/asy] First note that $O$ is not only the center of the circle but also the center of the square since the diagram is symmetric. Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the geometric setup\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric relationship between the square and the circle. The circle intersects the square such that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle.\n\n## Step 2: Draw the diagram and identify key properties\nBy drawing a diagram, we can visualize the problem. Let's denote the radius of the circle as $r$. Since each side of the square intersects the circle, forming a chord of length $r$, we can see that the distance from the center of the circle to any side of the square is $r/2$ because the chord is $r$ and it is bisected by the radius that is perpendicular to it.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the side length of the square\nThe side length of the square can be determined by considering the right triangle formed by the radius of the circle (which is also the hypotenuse of the triangle), the half chord (which is $r/2$), and the segment from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the side of the square. Using the Pythagorean theorem in this right triangle, we can find the length of the side of the square. The segment from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the side of the square is $\\sqrt{r^2 - (r/2)^2} = \\sqrt{r^2 - r^2/4} = \\sqrt{3r^2/4} = \\sqrt{3}r/2$. This length is half the side length of the square because it extends from the center of the circle to the midpoint of one of the square's sides. Thus, the full side length of the square is $2 \\times \\sqrt{3}r/2 = \\sqrt{3}r$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the square\nThe area of the square, $A_{square}$, is found by squaring the length of one of its sides: $A_{square} = (\\sqrt{3}r)^2 = 3r^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the area of the circle\nThe area of the circle, $A_{circle}$, is given by the formula $\\pi r^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle\nTo find the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle, we divide the area of the square by the area of the circle: $\\frac{A_{square}}{A_{circle}} = \\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}$. Simplifying this expression gives $\\frac{3}{\\pi}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$"
