The base has side $10$, so the diagonal will satisfy: $$d^2=10^2+10^2=200$$ $$d=10\\sqrt{2}$$ Half of this is $5\\sqrt{2}$.  Now we can look at the right triangle formed by the altitude from the vertex of the pyramid, the line just drawn in, and with hypotenuse as the edge we need to find the length of.  The length of this edge is: $$\\sqrt{12^2+(5\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{144+50}=\\sqrt{194}\\approx 13.928$$ The total length of all edges is: $$4(10)+4(13.928)\\approx \\boxed{ 96}$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the length of the base edges\nThe base of the pyramid is a square with sides of 10 cm. Since there are 4 edges on the base, the total length of the base edges is 4 * 10 = 40 cm.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the length of the slant edges\nTo find the length of the slant edges, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem. We can imagine a right triangle where the height of the pyramid (12 cm) is one leg, and half the diagonal of the base is the other leg. The diagonal of the base can be found using the Pythagorean theorem on the square base, where the diagonal is the hypotenuse. The diagonal of the base is sqrt(10^2 + 10^2) = sqrt(200) = 10 * sqrt(2) cm. Half of this diagonal is (10 * sqrt(2)) / 2 = 5 * sqrt(2) cm. Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the slant edge: sqrt((12)^2 + (5 * sqrt(2))^2) = sqrt(144 + 50) = sqrt(194) cm. Since there are 4 slant edges, the total length of the slant edges is 4 * sqrt(194) cm.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the numerical value of the total length of the slant edges\nUsing a calculator, we find that sqrt(194) is approximately 13.928 cm. So, the total length of the slant edges is 4 * 13.928 = 55.712 cm.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of the lengths of all the edges\nThe sum of the lengths of all the edges is the sum of the lengths of the base edges and the slant edges: 40 + 55.712 = 95.712 cm.\n\n## Step 5: Round the sum to the nearest whole number\nRounding 95.712 to the nearest whole number gives 96 cm.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{96}$"
