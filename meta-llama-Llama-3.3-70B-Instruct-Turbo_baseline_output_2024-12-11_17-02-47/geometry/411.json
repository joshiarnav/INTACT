    "solution": "$\\angle CDF = \\angle AEB$ and $\\angle BAE = \\angle CFD$, so we know that $\\bigtriangleup AEB \\sim \\bigtriangleup FDC$.  Thus, denoting the side length of $BEFC$ as $x$, we can create the ratios: $\\frac{28}{x} = \\frac{x}{58} \\Rightarrow x^2 = 1624$, and since $x^2$ is the area of square $BCFE$, $\\boxed{1624}$ is the answer.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the area of square $BCFE$ inscribed in right triangle $AGD$, given that $AB = 28$ units and $CD = 58$ units.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key properties of the figure\nThe square $BCFE$ is inscribed in the right triangle $AGD$, which means that its sides are parallel to the legs of the triangle and its vertices touch the sides of the triangle.\n\n## Step 3: Use the properties of similar triangles\n$\\triangle AEB \\sim \\triangle FDC$, because they share the same angle at $B$ and $C$, and their sides are parallel.\n\n## Step 4: Set up a proportion using similar triangles\nLet $x$ be the side length of the square. Then $\\frac{AB}{x} = \\frac{x}{CD}$, because corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional.\n\n## Step 5: Plug in the values and solve for $x$\n$\\frac{28}{x} = \\frac{x}{58}$, so $x^2 = 28 \\cdot 58 = 1624$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the area of the square\nThe area of the square is $x^2$, which we already found to be $1624$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1624}$"
