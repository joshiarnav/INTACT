Via parallel sides and alternate interior angles, we see that the opposite triangles are congruent ($\\triangle BPQ \\cong \\triangle DRS$, $\\triangle APS \\cong \\triangle CRQ$). Quickly we realize that $O$ is also the center of the rectangle.\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, we can solve for a side of the rhombus; $PQ = \\sqrt{15^2 + 20^2} = 25$. Since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors, we have that $OP = 15, OQ = 20$. Also, $\\angle POQ = 90^{\\circ}$, so quadrilateral $BPOQ$ is cyclic. By Ptolemy's Theorem, $25 \\cdot OB = 20 \\cdot 15 + 15 \\cdot 20 = 600$.\nBy similar logic, we have $APOS$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. Let $AP = x$, $AS = y$. The Pythagorean Theorem gives us $x^2 + y^2 = 625\\quad \\mathrm{(1)}$. Ptolemy\u2019s Theorem gives us $25 \\cdot OA = 20x + 15y$. Since the diagonals of a rectangle are equal, $OA = \\frac{1}{2}d = OB$, and $20x + 15y = 600\\quad \\mathrm{(2)}$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = 40 - \\frac 43x$. Substituting into $\\mathrm{(1)}$,\n\\begin{eqnarray*}x^2 + \\left(40-\\frac 43x\\right)^2 &=& 625\\\\ 5x^2 - 192x + 1755 &=& 0\\\\ x = \\frac{192 \\pm \\sqrt{192^2 - 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 1755}}{10} &=& 15, \\frac{117}{5}\\end{eqnarray*}\nWe reject $15$ because then everything degenerates into squares, but the condition that $PR \\neq QS$ gives us a contradiction. Thus $x = \\frac{117}{5}$, and backwards solving gives $y = \\frac{44}5$. The perimeter of $ABCD$ is $2\\left(20 + 15 + \\frac{117}{5} + \\frac{44}5\\right) = \\frac{672}{5}$, and $m + n = \\boxed{677}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a rectangle $ABCD$ with a rhombus $PQRS$ inscribed in it. The lengths of $PB$, $BQ$, $PR$, and $QS$ are provided as $15$, $20$, $30$, and $40$ respectively. We need to find the perimeter of the rectangle $ABCD$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key properties of the rhombus and rectangle\nSince $PQRS$ is a rhombus, all its sides are of equal length. Let's denote the length of each side of the rhombus as $x$. Also, the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.\n\n## Step 3: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the rhombus's side\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem on right triangles formed by the diagonals of the rhombus and the sides of the rectangle. For example, considering right triangle $PQB$, we have $x^2 = 15^2 + 20^2$. Solving this, $x^2 = 225 + 400$, so $x^2 = 625$ and $x = 25$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the lengths of the sides of the rectangle\nNow that we know the length of the rhombus's side is $25$, we can find the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. The length of side $AB$ is $PB + BQ = 15 + 20 = 35$. Similarly, the length of side $BC$ is $BQ + QC = 20 + 25 = 45$ (since $QC = x = 25$). The length of side $CD$ is $QS + SR = 40 + 25 = 65$ (since $SR = x = 25$). The length of side $DA$ is $PR + RP = 30 + 25 = 55$ (since $RP = x = 25$).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle\nThe perimeter of the rectangle $ABCD$ is $2(AB + BC) = 2(35 + 45) = 2 \\times 80 = 160$.\n\n## Step 6: Express the perimeter as a fraction in lowest terms\nThe perimeter is $160$, which can be expressed as a fraction $160/1$. So, $m = 160$ and $n = 1$.\n\n## Step 7: Find $m + n$\nNow, we just need to add $m$ and $n$ to get the final answer. $m + n = 160 + 1 = 161$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{161}$"
