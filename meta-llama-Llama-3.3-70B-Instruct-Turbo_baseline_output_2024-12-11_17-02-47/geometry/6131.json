    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and visualize the given information\nThe problem describes a square $ABCD$ and points $E$ and $F$ on sides $AD$ and $BC$ respectively, such that $BE = EF = FD = 30$. To start solving this problem, we need to understand the geometric configuration and how the given lengths divide the square.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the right triangles and apply the Pythagorean theorem\nThe segments $BE$, $EF$, and $FD$ divide the square into three equal horizontal sections. Let's denote the side length of the square as $x$. Considering the right triangle formed by $E$, $F$, and the vertex $B$, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the relationship between the lengths of the sides of the square and the given segments.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the length of the side of the square\nLet's denote $BE = EF = FD = 30$ as $y$. We have $y = 30$. From the given information, we know that the length of the side $AD$ or $BC$ is $x$. Considering right triangle $BEF$, we have $BF = x - y$ and $EF = y$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $BEF$\nTo the right triangle $BEF$, applying the Pythagorean theorem: $BE^2 + EF^2 = BF^2$. However, we must consider the entire length $BD$ which is equal to $x$ when calculating the lengths of the sides of the right triangle that involves points $B$, $E$, and $F$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the side length $x$ using the given information\nUsing the given information that $BE = EF = FD = 30$, we can consider the right triangle formed by the points $B$, $E$, and $D$. Let $x$ be the length! of the side of square $ABCD$. From the triangle $BED$, $BD = x$, $BE = 30$, and $ED = x - 30$ (since $FD = 30$ and $AD = x$). Applying the Pythagorean theorem to this triangle will help us find the value of $x$.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find $x$\nHowever, we need to correctly identify the sides of the triangle to apply the theorem. For triangle $BFD$, $BD = x$, $BF = x - 30$ (since $BE = EF = 30$), and $FD = 30$. Thus, we can write the equation as $x^2 = (x-30)^2 + 30^2$ for the triangle $BFD$ considering $BF$ as $x-30$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve the equation for $x$\nTo solve for $x$, expand the equation $x^2 = (x-30)^2 + 30^2$. This simplifies to $x^2 = x^2 - 60x + 900 + 900$. After simplification, we get $0 = -60x + 1800$, which further simplifies to $60x = 1800$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = 1800 / 60 = 30$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the area of the square $ABCD$\nThe area of a square is given by the formula $Area = side^2$. Since we've determined that the side length $x$ of the square is $30$, the area of the square $ABCD$ is $30^2 = 900$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{810}$"
