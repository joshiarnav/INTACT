    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the formula for the circumference of a circle\nThe formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = 2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.\n\n## Step 2: Use the given circumference to find the total length of the circle\nGiven that the circumference of circle $A$ is 60 feet, we can use this information to understand the proportions of the circle's parts.\n\n## Step 3: Understand the relationship between the central angle and the arc length\nThe length of an arc on a circle is directly proportional to the central angle it subtends. The full circle has a central angle of $360^\\circ$ and a circumference of 60 feet.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the length of the arc $\\widehat{BC}$\nThe central angle subtended by arc $\\widehat{BC}$ is $60^\\circ$. To find the length of $\\widehat{BC}$, we need to determine what fraction of the full circle it represents and then apply that fraction to the total circumference.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the fraction of the circle that $\\widehat{BC}$ represents\nSince $\\widehat{BC}$ subtends a central angle of $60^\\circ$ out of the full $360^\\circ$, it represents $\\frac{60^\\circ}{360^\\circ} = \\frac{1}{6}$ of the circle.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the fraction to the total circumference to find the length of $\\widehat{BC}$\nGiven that the total circumference is 60 feet, the length of $\\widehat{BC}$ can be calculated as $\\!fraction \\times total\\ circumference = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 60$ feet.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the length of $\\widehat{BC}$\n$\\frac{1}{6} \\times 60 = 10$ feet.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
