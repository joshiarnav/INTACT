    "solution": "Label points $A$, $B$, $C$ as shown below, and let $H$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$. [asy]\n\nsize(120);\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA = dir(0); B = dir(60); C = dir(120); D = dir(180); E = dir(240); F = dir(300);\n\nfill(B--C--E--F--cycle,heavycyan); pair H=(E+C)/2; draw(D--H); draw(E--C); label(\"$A$\",C,NW);label(\"$B$\",D,W);label(\"$C$\",E,SW);label(\"$H$\",H,ESE);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\n[/asy] Since the hexagon is regular, $\\angle ABC = 120^\\circ$ and $\\angle ABH = \\angle CBH = 120^\\circ / 2 = 60^\\circ$.  Thus, $\\triangle ABH$ and $\\triangle CBH$ are congruent $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ triangles.  These triangles are each half an equilateral triangle, so their short leg is half as long as their hypotenuse.\n\nSince $AB=BC=10$, we have $BH = AB/2 = 5$ and $AH = CH = \\sqrt{10^2-5^2} = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}$.  (Notice that this value is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of $BH$, the short leg.  In general, the ratio of the sides in a $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, which can be shown by the Pythagorean Theorem.)  Then, $AC = 2\\cdot 5\\sqrt{3} = 10\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe shaded region is a rectangle with base length $10$ and height length $10\\sqrt{3}$; its area is $10\\cdot 10\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{100\\sqrt{3}}$ square cm.",
