    "solution": "At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{2}{3}(360^\\circ)=240$ degrees.  Every minute, the minute hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}(360^\\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12} (360^\\circ)=0.5$ degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.  After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\\circ-5.5^\\circ\\cdot 15=\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand how to calculate the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock.\n## Step 2:  At 8:15, the minute hand will be at the 3 (since 15 minutes have passed) and the hour hand will be between the 8 and the 9.\n## Step 3:  The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which means it moves 30 degrees per hour. Additionally, it moves 0.5 degrees per minute because 30 degrees (per hour) divided by 60 minutes (in an hour) equals 0.5.\n## Step 4:  At 8:00, the hour hand is at the 8, which is 240 degrees from the 12 o'clock position (since each hour mark is 30 degrees apart).\n## Step 5:  By 8:15, the hour hand will have moved an additional 15 * 0.5 = 7.5 degrees.\n## Step 6:  So, the position of the hour hand at 8:15 is 240 + 7.5 = 247.5 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n## Step 7:  The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which means it moves 6 degrees per minute.\n## Step 8:  At 8:15, the minute hand will be at 15 * 6 = 90 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n## Step 9:  Now, we need to find the smaller angle between the hour and minute hands. This can be done by finding the absolute difference between their positions.\n## Step 10:  The absolute difference between 247.5 degrees and 90 degrees is |247.5 - 90| = 157.5 degrees.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of the clock at 8:15 is 157.5 degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{157.5}$"
