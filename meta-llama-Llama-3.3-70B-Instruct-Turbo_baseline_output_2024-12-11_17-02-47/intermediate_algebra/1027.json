    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the function\nWe are given the function $f(x,y,z) = \\frac{x}{x + y} + \\frac{y}{y + z} + \\frac{z}{z + x}$ and we need to find the set of all possible values of $f(x,y,z)$ for positive real numbers $x,$ $y,$ $z$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the given expression\nSince $x,$ $y,$ $z$ are positive real numbers, each term $\\frac{x}{x + y}$, $\\frac{y}{y + z}$, and $\\frac{z}{z + x}$ is positive and less than 1.\n\n## Step 3: Establishing bounds for the function\nWe notice that $\\frac{x}{x + y} < 1$, $\\frac{y}{y + z} < 1$, and $\\frac{z}{z + x} < 1$ because the denominators are always greater than the numerators. This implies that $f(x,y,z) < 3$.\n\n## Step 4: Exploring the lower bound\nTo find a lower bound, we can use the fact that for any positive real numbers $a$ and $b$, $\\frac{a}{a + b} > \\frac{a}{a + b + c}$ for any positive $c$. However, a more straightforward approach to establish a lower bound is to recognize that since each term is positive, the sum must be greater than 1, because if we had $x = y = z$, then $f(x,y,z) = \\frac{3}{2}$. But to prove it's always greater than 1, consider that if one term is very small, the others must sum to more than 1 to compensate, given their structure.\n\n## Step 5: Lower bound justification\nFor a rigorous lower bound, observe that $f(x,y,z) = \\frac{x}{x + y} + \\frac{y}{y + z} + \\frac{z}{z + x} > \\frac{x}{x + y + z} + \\frac{y}{x + y + z} + \\frac{z}{x + y + z} = 1$. This step ensures that $f(x,y,z)$ is indeed greater than 1.\n\n## Step 6: Upper bound justification\nFor the upper bound, we've already established that $f(x,y,z) < 3$ by noting each term is less than 1.\n\n## Step 7: Exploring the range of $f(x,y,z)$\nGiven that $f(x,y,z)$ must be greater than 1 and less than 3, and considering the nature of the function, which allows for $x$, $y$, and $z$ to vary widely, it seems plausible that $f(x,y,z)$ could approach 1 and 2 closely, depending on the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$.\n\n## Step 8: Conclusion on the range of $f(x,y,z)$\nWe conclude that the set of all possible values of $f(x,y,z)$ is the interval $(1, 2)$, considering the function's behavior as $x$, $y$, and $z$ vary. The function can get arbitrarily close to 1 and 2 but cannot reach or exceed these values due to the constraints on $x$, $y$, and $z$ being positive.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(1,2)}$"
