    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Review the properties of the function $f$.\nThe function $f$ has three main properties: (i) it is increasing, meaning $f(n + 1) > f(n)$ for all positive integers $n$; (ii) it is multiplicative, meaning $f(mn) = f(m) f(n)$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$; and (iii) for any two different positive integers $m$ and $n$ where $m^n = n^m$, either $f(m) = n$ or $f(n) = m$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply property (iii) to known cases.\nOne well-known case where $m^n = n^m$ is when $m = 2$ and $n = 4$, because $2^4 = 4^2$. According to property (iii), this means either $f(2) = 4$ or $f(4) = 2$. However, since $f$ is increasing, it cannot be that $f(4) = 2$ because $f(3)$ would have to be greater than $f(2)$ but less than $f(4)$, which is not possible if $f(4) = 2$. Therefore, $f(2) = 4$.\n\n## Step 3: Use property (ii) to find $f(4)$.\nSince $f(2) = 4$ and $f(mn) = f(m)f(n)$, we can find $f(4)$ by considering $4 = 2 \\times 2$. Thus, $f(4) = f(2 \\times 2) = f(2) \\times f(2) = 4 \\times 4 = 16$.\n\n## Step 4: Apply property (ii) to find $f(3)$.\nGiven that $f$ is increasing and $f(2) = 4$ and $f(4) = 16$, $f(3)$ must be greater than $f(2)$ but less than $f(4)$. The only value that satisfies the increasing property and the multiplicative property for $f(3)$, considering potential values for $f(3)$ and the need for $f(6)$ and $f(9)$ to be consistent with the properties, is $f(3) = 9$. This is because $f(6) = f(2) \\times f(3)$ and $f(9) = f(3) \\times f(3)$, and these need to fit the increasing pattern.\n\n## Step 5: Verify $f(3) = 9$ is consistent with all properties.\nIf $f(3) = 9$, then $f(6) = f(2) \\times f(3) = 4 \\times 9 = 36$ and $f(9) = f(3) \\times f(3) = 9 \\times 9 = 81$. This is consistent with the increasing property since $f(6) < f(9)$ and both are greater than $f(4)$, maintaining the increasing order.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $f(30)$ using property (ii).\nGiven $f(2) = 4$, $f(3) = 9$, and $f(5)$ needs to be determined in a way that's consistent with the properties. Since $f$ is increasing, $f(5)$ must be greater than $f(4) = 16$. Considering $f(5)$ and the need for $f(10)$, $f(15)$, and $f(30)$ to fit the pattern, we must determine $f(5)$ carefully. For $f(5)$, a potential candidate must be a square to fit the multiplicative property easily, but it also must be less than $f(6) = 36$ to maintain the increasing property. Thus, a reasonable guess for $f(5)$, considering it needs to be a number that when multiplied by itself gives a value consistent with the properties for $f(25)$, and knowing $f(10)$ and $f(15)$ should fit the increasing pattern, is necessary.\n\n## Step 7: Determine $f(5)$.\nSince $f(5)$ needs to be greater than $f(4) = 16$ but less than $f(6) = 36$, and considering the multiplicative property, a logical approach is to consider what $f(5)$ would need to be to satisfy the conditions for $f(10)$, $f(15)$, and $f(25)$, keeping in mind the properties. Given $f(2) = 4$ and $f(3) = 9$, and aiming for consistency, $f(5)$ could logically be $25$, as it fits well with potential values for $f(10)$ and $f(15)$, and it's consistent with the increasing property.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate $f(30)$.\nWith $f(2) = 4$, $f(3) = 9$, and $f(5) = 25$, we can calculate $f(30)$ as $f(30) = f(2) \\times f(3) \\times f(5) = 4 \\times 9 \\times 25 = 900$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{900}$"
