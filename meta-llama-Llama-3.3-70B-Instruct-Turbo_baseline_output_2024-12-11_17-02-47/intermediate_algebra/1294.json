    "solution": "From the given information we know that $|a| |b| = |ab| = 2\\sqrt{26}$. We can also write $|ab| = |t-2i| = \\sqrt{t^2 + 4}$. Setting these equal, we have $$\\sqrt{t^2 + 4} = 2\\sqrt{26} \\Rightarrow\nt^2 + 4 = 104.$$The positive answer is $t = \\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the relationship between the magnitude of complex numbers and their product.\nThe magnitude of the product of two complex numbers $a$ and $b$ is equal to the product of their magnitudes, i.e., $|ab| = |a||b|$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of the product $ab$ using the given information.\nGiven $|a|=2$ and $|b|=\\sqrt{26}$, we can find $|ab|$ as $|ab| = |a||b| = 2 \\times \\sqrt{26} = 2\\sqrt{26}$.\n\n## Step 3: Express the magnitude of $ab$ in terms of $t$.\nGiven $ab = t-2i$, the magnitude $|ab|$ can also be expressed as $\\sqrt{t^2 + (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{t^2 + 4}$.\n\n## Step 4: Equate the two expressions for $|ab|$ and solve for $t$.\nSetting the two expressions for $|ab|$ equal to each other gives $2\\sqrt{26} = \\sqrt{t^2 + 4}$. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root yields $(2\\sqrt{26})^2 = t^2 + 4$, which simplifies to $4 \\times 26 = t^2 + 4$ or $104 = t^2 + 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $t^2$.\nSubtract 4 from both sides to isolate $t^2$, resulting in $t^2 = 104 - 4 = 100$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $t$.\nTaking the square root of both sides gives $t = \\pm \\sqrt{100} = \\pm 10$. Since we are looking for the positive value of $t$, we select $t = 10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
