    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Rewrite the given equation of the ellipse in standard form\nTo find the distance between the foci of the ellipse, we first need to rewrite the given equation in standard form. Completing the square for both x and y terms, we get $16(x^2 - 4x) + (y^2 + 4y) = -4$. Completing the square gives $16(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 + 4y + 4) = -4 + 64 + 4$. Simplifying this expression yields $16(x - 2)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 64$.\n\n## Step 2: Divide the equation by 64 to get the standard form of the ellipse\nDividing the equation by 64, we obtain $\\frac{(x - 2)^2}{4} + \\frac{(y + 2)^2}{64} = 1$. This is the standard form of the equation of an ellipse, $\\frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} + \\frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} = 1$, where $h = 2$, $k = -2$, $a^2 = 64$, and $b^2 = 4$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the values of a and b\nFrom the standard form of the equation, we can determine that $a = \\sqrt{64} = 8$ and $b = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the value of c\nThe relationship between a, b, and c for an ellipse is given by $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$. Substituting the values of a and b, we get $c^2 = 8^2 - 2^2 = 64 - 4 = 60$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find $c = \\sqrt{60} = 2\\sqrt{15}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the distance between the foci\nThe distance between the foci of an ellipse is given by $2c$. Substituting the value of c, we get $2c = 2 \\times 2\\sqrt{15} = 4\\sqrt{15}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{15}}$"
