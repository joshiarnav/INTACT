    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Factor out the common term\nThe equation can be rewritten by factoring out $x^6$ from all terms: $x^6(x^4+7x^3+14x^2+1729x-1379)=0$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the solutions for the first factor\nFor the equation $x^6=0$, the only solution is $x=0$. However, since we are looking for positive real solutions, $x=0$ is not a valid solution in this context.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the second factor\nWe now consider the equation $x^4+7x^3+14x^2+1729x-1379=0$. To find the number of positive real solutions, we can apply Descartes' Rule of Signs.\n\n## Step 4: Apply Descartes' Rule of Signs\nAccording to Descartes' Rule of Signs, the number of positive real roots in a polynomial equation is either equal to the number of sign changes in the coefficients of the polynomial or less than that by a positive even number. In the polynomial $x^4+7x^3+14x^2+1729x-1379$, there is 1 sign change (from positive to negative), which means there is exactly 1 positive real root.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
