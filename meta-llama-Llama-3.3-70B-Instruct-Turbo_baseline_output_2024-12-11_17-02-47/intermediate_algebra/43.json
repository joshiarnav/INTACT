    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the function f(z) and the condition for f(z) = z\nThe function $f(z) = i\\overline{z}$ is given, and we need to find $z$ such that $f(z) = z$. So, we have $i\\overline{z} = z$.\n\n## Step 2: Express z in terms of its real and imaginary parts\nLet $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. Then the complex conjugate $\\overline{z} = a - bi$.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute z and its conjugate into the equation $i\\overline{z} = z$\nSubstituting $z = a + bi$ and $\\overline{z} = a - bi$ into $i\\overline{z} = z$, we get $i(a - bi) = a + bi$. Simplifying this gives $ia - i^2b = a + bi$. Since $i^2 = -1$, we have $ia + b = a + bi$.\n\n## Step 4: Separate the real and imaginary parts\nEquating the real parts and imaginary parts separately, we get $b = a$ and $ia = bi$. From $b = a$, we have $a = b$. The equation $ia = bi$ is always true given $a = b$.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the condition |z| = 5\nGiven $|z| = 5$, and $z = a + bi$, we have $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 5$. Since $a = b$ from the previous step, we substitute $b$ with $a$ to get $\\sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = 5$. Simplifying, $\\sqrt{2a^2} = 5$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for a\nSquaring both sides of $\\sqrt{2a^2} = 5$, we get $2a^2 = 25$. Dividing both sides by 2, we have $a^2 = \\frac{25}{2}$. Taking the square root of both sides, $a = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{25}{2}}$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the number of solutions for z\nSince $a = b$, and $a$ can be either $\\sqrt{\\frac{25}{2}}$ or $-\\sqrt{\\frac{25}{2}}$, there are two possible values for $z$: $z = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{2}} + i\\sqrt{\\frac{25}{2}}$ and $z = -\\sqrt{\\frac{25}{2}} - i\\sqrt{\\frac{25}{2}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
