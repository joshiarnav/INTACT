    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Use the Remainder Theorem for the division by $x - 1$\nAccording to the Remainder Theorem, if $f(x)$ is divided by $x - c$, the remainder is $f(c)$. Therefore, when $f(x)$ is divided by $x - 1$, we substitute $x = 1$ into $f(x)$ to find the remainder. So, $f(1) = a(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + b(1) - 5 = a - 6 + b - 5 = a + b - 11$. We are given that this remainder is $-5$, so we have $a + b - 11 = -5$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the equation from Step 1 for $a + b$\nRearrange the equation $a + b - 11 = -5$ to solve for $a + b$. Adding 11 to both sides gives $a + b = 6$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the Remainder Theorem for the division by $x + 2$\nSimilarly, for division by $x + 2$, we substitute $x = -2$ into $f(x)$ to find the remainder. So, $f(-2) = a(-2)^3 - 6(-2)^2 + b(-2) - 5 = -8a - 24 - 2b - 5 = -8a - 2b - 29$. We are given that this remainder is $-53$, so we have $-8a - 2b - 29 = -53$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation from Step 3 for $-8a - 2b$\nRearrange the equation $-8a - 2b - 29 = -53$ to solve for $-8a - 2b$. Adding 29 to both sides gives $-8a - 2b = -24$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the system of equations from Step 2 and Step 4\nWe have two equations: $a + b = 6$ (from Step 2) and $-8a - 2b = -24$ (from Step 4). First, simplify the second equation by dividing everything by -2, getting $4a + b = 12$. Now we have a system of equations:\n1. $a + b = 6$\n2. $4a + b = 12$\n\n## Step 6: Solve for $a$ using the system of equations\nSubtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $b$: $(4a + b) - (a + b) = 12 - 6$, which simplifies to $3a = 6$. Solving for $a$ gives $a = 2$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for $b$ using $a = 2$ in one of the original equations\nSubstitute $a = 2$ into $a + b = 6$ to find $b$. So, $2 + b = 6$, which simplifies to $b = 4$.\n\n## Step 8: Write down the ordered pair $(a, b)$\nFrom Steps 6 and 7, we have $a = 2$ and $b = 4$, so the ordered pair $(a, b)$ is $(2, 4)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(2, 4)}$"
