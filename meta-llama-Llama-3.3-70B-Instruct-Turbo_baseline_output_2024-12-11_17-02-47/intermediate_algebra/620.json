    "solution": "An example of a quadratic function with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ is $(x-2)(x-4)$. However, when $x=3$, this function takes the value $-1$. However, multiplying the entire quadratic by $-6$ does not change the location of the zeroes, and does give us the desired value at $x=3$.\n\nThus, $-6(x-2)(x-4)$ has all the desired properties. The expanded form of this expression is $\\boxed{-6x^2+36x-48}$.\n\nNote that this is the only such quadratic. Any quadratic must factor as $a(x-r)(x-s)$, where its zeroes are $r$ and $s$; thus a quadratic with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ must be of the form $a(x-2)(x-4)$, and the coefficient $a=-6$ is forced by the value at $x=3$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the form of the quadratic function\nGiven the zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$, the quadratic function can be written in the form $f(x) = a(x-2)(x-4)$, where $a$ is a constant coefficient we need to find.\n\n## Step 2: Use the given point to find the coefficient $a$\nWe are given that $f(3) = 6$. Substituting $x=3$ into our function gives us $6 = a(3-2)(3-4)$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $a$\nSimplifying the equation from Step 2, we get $6 = a(1)(-1)$, which simplifies to $6 = -a$. Solving for $a$ gives us $a = -6$.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute $a$ back into the function and expand\nSubstituting $a = -6$ into the function $f(x) = a(x-2)(x-4)$ gives us $f(x) = -6(x-2)(x-4)$. Expanding this gives $f(x) = -6(x^2 - 6x + 8)$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expanded form\nSimplifying $f(x) = -6(x^2 - 6x + 8)$ gives $f(x) = -6x^2 + 36x - 48$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-6x^2 + 36x - 48}$"
