    "solution": "Note that when multiplying quadratics, terms add up similar to the equations of a system, so let\\begin{align*} p(x) &= (x^2 + ax + c)(x^2 + bx + d) \\\\ &= x^4 + (a+b)x^3 + (ab+c+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + cd \\\\ &= x^4 + 15x^3 + 78x^2 + 160x + 96 \\end{align*}Factoring $p(x)$ with the Rational Root Theorem results in $(x+4)(x+4)(x+1)(x+6)$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, we know that $x+4, x+4, x+1, x+6$ are all the linear factors of the polynomial, so the quadratic factors can only be multiplied from these linear factors.\nThere are only two possible distinct groupings (not counting rearrangements) -- $(x^2 + 8x + 16)(x^2 + 7x + 6)$ and $(x^2 + 5x + 4)(x^2 + 10x + 24)$. In the first case, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 405$, and in the second case, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 717$. The largest of the two options is $\\boxed{717}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recognize the given system of equations as related to the coefficients of a polynomial when it is factored and when it is expanded.\nThe system of equations can be related to the expansion of a quadratic equation of the form $(x^2 + ax + c)(x^2 + bx + d)$.\n\n## Step 2: Write down the expansion of the polynomial to identify how coefficients relate to the equations given.\nExpanding $(x^2 + ax + c)(x^2 + bx + d)$ results in $x^4 + (a+b)x^3 + (ab+c+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + cd$. Matching coefficients of this expansion to the given system of equations provides insight into constructing a polynomial that represents the system.\n\n## Step 3: Construct a polynomial that corresponds to the system of equations.\nUsing the given equations, we can write the polynomial as $x^4 + 15x^3 + 78x^2 + 160x + 96$.\n\n## Step 4: Factor the polynomial to find possible values for a, b, c, and d.\nTo factor $x^4 + 15x^3 + 78x^2 + 160x + 96$, look for its roots or factor it by grouping. This step may require trial and error or the use of the Rational Root Theorem.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the Rational Root Theorem to find potential rational roots of the polynomial.\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational solution, in its most reduced form, is of the form $\\pm \\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ is a factor of the constant term (96) and $q$ is a factor of the leading coefficient (1). Thus, the potential rational roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 4, \\pm 6, \\pm 8, \\pm 12, \\pm 16, \\pm 24, \\pm 32, \\pm 48, \\pm 96$.\n\n## Step 6: Test potential rational roots or use synthetic division to find a root.\nUpon inspection or calculation, we find that $x = -4$ and $x = -4$ could be roots (though this step might involve trial and error or synthetic division, which is not detailed here due to format constraints), suggesting the polynomial could factor as $(x+4)^2(x^2 + 7x + 6)$.\n\n## Step 7: Further factor the quadratic part of the polynomial.\nThe quadratic part, $x^2 + 7x + 6$, factors into $(x+1)(x+6)$.\n\n## Step 8: Write down the complete factorization of the polynomial.\nThus, the polynomial factors as $(x+4)^2(x+1)(x+6)$.\n\n## Step 9: Group the factors to represent the original quadratic factors.\nTo match the form $(x^2 + ax + c)(x^2 + bx + d)$, we can group the factors as $((x+4)^2)(x+1)(x+6)$ or $((x+4)(x+1))((x+4)(x+6))$, which simplifies to $(x^2 + 8x + 16)(x^2 + 10x + 24)$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate a, b, c, and d from the factored form.\nFrom $(x^2 + 8x + 16)(x^2 + 10x + 24)$, we identify $a = 8$, $b = 10$, $c = 16$, and $d = 24$.\n\n## Step 11: Compute $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$.\nThen, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 8^2 + 10^2 + 16^2 + 24^2 = 64 + 100 + 256 + 576 = 996$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{996}$"
