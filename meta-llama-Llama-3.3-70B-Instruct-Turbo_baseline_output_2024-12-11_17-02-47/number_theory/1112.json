    "solution": "We notice that in the units column, it's impossible for $\\triangle+2=1_6$. So, it must be the case that $\\triangle+2=11_6=7$. That would mean $\\triangle=7-2=\\boxed{5}$. We can check that our answer works by plugging our value for triangle into the original problem: $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & 3 & 2 & 1 & 5_6\\\\ & & & 5 & 4 & 0_6\\\\ &+ & & & 5 & 2_6\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & 4 & 2 & 5 & 1_6.\\\\ \\end{array} $$The addition problem still works, so our answer is correct.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nWe are given an addition problem where one digit, represented by $\\triangle$, needs to be determined. The addition is performed in base 6.\n\n## Step 2: Start solving from the rightmost column\nLooking at the rightmost column, we have $\\triangle + 0 + 2 = 1_6$. However, since we are working in base 6, the result of $\\triangle + 2$ must be greater than or equal to 6 to carry over to the next column and result in a 1 in the units place.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the possible values for $\\triangle$\nGiven that $\\triangle + 2$ results in a carry in base 6, $\\triangle$ must be 5 because $5 + 2 = 7$, which is $11_6$. This means $\\triangle$ equals 5.\n\n## Step 4: Verify the solution by checking the other columns\nNow that we have $\\triangle = 5$, let's verify if this works for the entire problem:\n- The rightmost column: $5 + 0 + 2 = 7$, which is $11_6$, so we have a 1 in the units place and a carry of 1.\n- The second column from the right: $1 + 4 + 5 = 10$, which is $14_6$, so we have a 4 in the second column and a carry of 1.\n- The third column from the right: $1 + 2 + 1 = 4$, which matches our problem.\n- The leftmost column: $3 + 0 + 0 = 3$, but we have a carry from the previous step, so it becomes $3 + 1 = 4$, which matches the problem.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
