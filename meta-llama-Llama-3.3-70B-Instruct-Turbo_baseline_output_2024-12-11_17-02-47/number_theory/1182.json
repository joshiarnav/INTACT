    "problem": "Find the residue of $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$.",
    "solution": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7. So the residue of the sum is  $$\n182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\equiv \\boxed{10} \\pmod{14}.\n$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the first term of the expression\nThe first term is $182\\cdot 12$. To simplify this, we should first find the residue of 182 modulo 14. Since $182 = 14\\cdot 13$, the residue of 182 modulo 14 is 0.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the residue of the first term\nGiven that the residue of 182 modulo 14 is 0, the residue of $182\\cdot 12$ modulo 14 will also be 0, because any number multiplied by 0 is 0.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the second term of the expression\nThe second term is $15\\cdot 7$. To simplify this, we calculate $15\\cdot 7 = 105$. Now, we find the residue of 105 modulo 14. Since $105 = 14\\cdot 7 + 7$, the residue of 105 modulo 14 is 7.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the residue of the third term\nThe third term is 3. The residue of 3 modulo 14 is 3 itself, because 3 is less than 14.\n\n## Step 5: Combine the residues to find the overall residue\nNow we combine the residues: $0 - 7 + 3$. This simplifies to $-4$.\n\n## Step 6: Ensure the final residue is within the range of 0 to 13\nSince $-4$ is not within the range of 0 to 13, we need to find an equivalent residue within this range. Adding 14 to $-4$ gives us 10, which is within the desired range.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
