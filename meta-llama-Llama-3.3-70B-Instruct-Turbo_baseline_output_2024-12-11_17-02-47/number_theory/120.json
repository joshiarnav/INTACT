    "problem": "What is the maximum possible value of the greatest common divisor of two consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n = n! + n$, where $n \\ge 0$?",
    "solution": "We start by taking the first step in the Euclidean algorithm: subtract the initial two terms. Notice that\n\\begin{align*}a_{n+1} - (n+1)a_n &= (n+1)! + n + 1 - (n+1)(n! + n) \\\\ &= (n+1)! + n + 1 - (n+1)! - n(n+1) \\\\ &= -n^2 + 1 = -(n-1)(n+1).\n\\end{align*}It follows that by the Euclidean Algorithm, \\begin{align*}\\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, a_{n+1}) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, a_{n+1} - (n+1)a_n)\\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, (n-1)(n+1)),\\end{align*}since the minus sign is irrelevant for calculating the gcd.\n\nWe know that $n-1$ divides $n!$, so that $n-1$ is relatively prime to $a_n = n! + n$:\n$$\\text{gcd}\\,(n-1,n!+n) = \\text{gcd}\\,(n-1,n) = 1.$$Thus, we can ignore the factor of $n-1$ completely, and say that\n$$\\text{gcd}\\,(a_n,a_{n+1}) = \\text{gcd}\\,(n! + n, n+1).$$Now, we have several cases, depending on whether $n+1$ is prime or composite. We also have a few edge cases to consider. The basic idea is that when $n+1$ is composite and greater than $4$, $n+1$ is a factor of $n!$, whereas when $n+1$ is prime, we can apply Wilson's Theorem.\n\n$\\textit{Case 0:}$ For $n = 0$, we find that $a_0 = 1, a_1 = 2$, with greatest common divisor $1$.\n\n$\\textit{Case composite:}$\n\n$\\qquad \\textit{Subcase 1:}$ If $n+1$ is composite and can be written as the product of two distinct integers greater than $1$ (say $n+1 = a \\times b$, $a > b > 1$), then $n+1$ divides\n$$n! = 1 \\times \\cdots \\times b \\times \\cdots \\times a \\times \\cdots \\times n.$$By the same argument as before, since $n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime, then $n! + n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime, yielding a greatest common divisor of $1$.\n\n$\\qquad \\textit{Subcase 2:}$ If $n+1 = p^2$ for some prime $p$, then $n! + n = (p^2 - 1)! + p^2-1$. If $2p < p^2 - 1$, then $p$ and $2p$ are both factors that appear in the expansion of $n!$, so $n+1$ divides $n!$ and the previous argument applies. For $p = 2$, we can quickly check that $3! + 3 = 9$ is relatively prime with $4$.\n\n$\\textit{Case prime:}$ If $n + 1 = p$ for some prime $p$, then $n! + n \\equiv (p-1)! + (p-1) \\equiv -2 \\pmod{p}$ by Wilson's Theorem. Thus, $n! + n$ is relatively prime with $n+1$ unless $n = 1$, for which we obtain $a_1 = 2, a_2 = 4$, with greatest common divisor 2.\n\nSo, the largest the greatest common divisor of two consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n$ can be is $\\boxed{2}$, which is achieved when we take $n=1$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the sequence $a_n = n! + n$\nThe sequence $a_n$ is defined as $n! + n$, where $n$ starts from $0$ and goes to infinity. This means the first few terms of the sequence are $a_0 = 0! + 0 = 1$, $a_1 = 1! + 1 = 2$, $a_2 = 2! + 2 = 4$, $a_3 = 3! + 3 = 9$, and so on.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the definition of the greatest common divisor (GCD)\nThe greatest common divisor of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. For two consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n$, we are looking for the maximum possible value of their GCD.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the relationship between consecutive terms\nTo find the GCD of consecutive terms, let's examine $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$. $a_n = n! + n$ and $a_{n+1} = (n+1)! + (n+1)$. Notice that $(n+1)! = (n+1) \\times n!$, which means $a_{n+1}$ includes a factor of $n!$ in its factorial part.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the potential common factors\nSince $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$ both include $n!$ in their definitions (implicitly for $a_{n+1}$), any common factor they have must be related to the $n!$ part or the $n$ and $n+1$ parts. However, because $n$ and $n+1$ are consecutive integers, they share no common factors other than 1. Thus, we focus on the factorial part for potential common factors.\n\n## Step 5: Realize the limitation due to consecutive integers\nGiven that $n$ and $n+1$ are consecutive, they do not share any prime factors. The factorial part $(n+1)!$ includes all prime factors up to $n+1$, but when considering $n! + n$ and $(n+1)! + (n+1)$, the addition of $n$ and $n+1$ respectively introduces a complexity that doesn't straightforwardly lead to a common divisor greater than 1 due to the nature of consecutive integers.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the special case of $n=1$\nFor $n=1$, $a_1 = 1! + 1 = 2$ and $a_2 = 2! + 2 = 4$. Here, the GCD of $a_1$ and $a_2$ is 2, which is greater than 1. This is a simple and direct case where we can see the GCD of two consecutive terms is indeed greater than 1.\n\n## Step 7: Realize the GCD cannot exceed 2 for larger n\nFor $n > 1$, the factorial term dominates, and the addition of $n$ or $n+1$ does not contribute a common factor with the previous term due to the nature of factorials and consecutive integers. The largest possible GCD for consecutive terms after the initial terms is thus limited.\n\n## Step 8: Conclude the maximum possible GCD\nGiven the analysis, the maximum possible value of the GCD of two consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n = n! + n$ is achieved in the simplest case where $n=1$, yielding a GCD of 2. This is because for larger $n$, the factorial growth introduces unique factors in each term, making a GCD greater than 1 unlikely except in this initial case.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
