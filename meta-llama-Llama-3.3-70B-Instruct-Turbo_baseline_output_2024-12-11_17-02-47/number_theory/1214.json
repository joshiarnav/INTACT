    "solution": "Adding the first digits, we get $8$, hence $2$ after carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, again with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $2$, with carrying. Finally, adding $1$ to one, we get $2$. Thus our final answer is $\\boxed{22112_6}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Convert the first number, $2343_6$, to base 10 to make it easier to add.\nTo convert $2343_6$ to base 10, we need to multiply each digit by the corresponding power of 6 and then sum them up. So, $2343_6 = 2 \\cdot 6^3 + 3 \\cdot 6^2 + 4 \\cdot 6^1 + 3 \\cdot 6^0$.\n\n## Step 2: Perform the calculation for $2343_6$ in base 10.\n$2 \\cdot 6^3 = 2 \\cdot 216 = 432$, $3 \\cdot 6^2 = 3 \\cdot 36 = 108$, $4 \\cdot 6^1 = 4 \\cdot 6 = 24$, and $3 \\cdot 6^0 = 3 \\cdot 1 = 3$. Adding these up gives $432 + 108 + 24 + 3 = 567$.\n\n## Step 3: Convert the second number, $15325_6$, to base 10.\nTo convert $15325_6$ to base 10, we follow the same process: $15325_6 = 1 \\cdot 6^4 + 5 \\cdot 6^3 + 3 \\cdot 6^2 + 2 \\cdot 6^1 + 5 \\cdot 6^0$.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the calculation for $15325_6$ in base 10.\n$1 \\cdot 6^4 = 1 \\cdot 1296 = 1296$, $5 \\cdot 6^3 = 5 \\cdot 216 = 1080$, $3 \\cdot 6^2 = 3 \\cdot 36 = 108$, $2 \\cdot 6^1 = 2 \\cdot 6 = 12$, and $5 \\cdot 6^0 = 5 \\cdot 1 = 5$. Adding these up gives $1296 + 1080 + 108 + 12 + 5 = 2501$.\n\n## Step 5: Add the two base 10 numbers together.\n$567 + 2501 = 3068$.\n\n## Step 6: Convert the sum, $3068$, back to base 6.\nTo convert $3068$ to base 6, we divide by 6 and keep track of the remainders. $3068 \\div 6 = 511$ remainder $2$, $511 \\div 6 = 85$ remainder $1$, $85 \\div 6 = 14$ remainder $1$, $14 \\div 6 = 2$ remainder $2$, $2 \\div 6 = 0$ remainder $2$. So, in base 6, $3068$ is $22112_6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{221126}$"
