    "problem": "What is the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 which has two even and two odd digits?",
    "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the requirements for the number\nWe need to find the smallest four-digit number that is divisible by 9 and has two even and two odd digits.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the divisibility rule for 9\nA number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the smallest possible four-digit number\nThe smallest four-digit number is 1000, but it does not meet the criteria of having two even and two odd digits, nor is it divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 4: Find the smallest four-digit number with two even and two odd digits\nTo minimize the number, we should start with the smallest possible digits. The smallest even digits are 0 and 2, and the smallest odd digits are 1 and 3. However, we need to arrange these digits in such a way that the number is as small as possible and also meets the divisibility requirement for 9.\n\n## Step 5: Arrange the digits to meet the divisibility rule for 9\nThe sum of the digits 0, 2, 1, and 3 is 6, which is not divisible by 9. We need to increase the sum to the next multiple of 9, which is 9. The smallest possible arrangement that meets this requirement is by using the digits 0, 2, 3, and 4 (since 0+2+3+4 = 9), but this does not give us two odd and two even digits as required.\n\n## Step 6: Adjust the digits to meet both the divisibility and even/odd requirements\nConsidering the next possible combination that gives us two even and two odd digits and is divisible by 9, we could use 0, 8, 1, and 0 (but this uses two zeros, which might not be ideal for a four-digit number), or more realistically, 2, 8, 1, and 8 (but this uses two 8s, which again might not be ideal). However, a better approach would be to find a combination where the sum of the digits is 9 (the smallest multiple of 9) and then adjust from there, keeping in mind the need for two even and two odd digits.\n\n## Step 7: Identify a suitable combination of digits\nA suitable combination could involve adjusting from the lowest possible digits while ensuring divisibility by 9 and meeting the even/odd requirement. Considering the sum needs to be a multiple of 9, and we aim for the smallest possible number, let's consider using 0, 8 (for the even digits), and then find two odd digits that, when added to 0 + 8, give a sum divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the sum of 0 and 8, then find the odd digits\n0 + 8 = 8. To reach the next multiple of 9 (which is 18, since 9 itself cannot be made with two even and two odd digits), we need two odd digits that sum to 10 (since 18 - 8 = 10). The smallest odd digits that sum to 10 are 1 and 9.\n\n## Step 9: Arrange the digits to form the smallest possible number\nUsing 0, 8, 1, and 9, the smallest possible arrangement that meets all the criteria (four-digit number, divisible by 9, two even and two odd digits) would be 1089.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1089}$"
