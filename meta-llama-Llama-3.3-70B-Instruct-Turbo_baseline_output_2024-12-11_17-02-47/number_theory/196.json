    "problem": "What is the greatest common divisor of $1729$ and $1768$?",
    "solution": "By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768 - 1729) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 39).\n\\end{align*}Since the sum of the digits of $1729$ is $19$, which is not divisible by $3$, it suffices to check whether or not $1729$ is divisible by $13$. We can find that it is by long division or noting that $12+1 = \\boxed{13}$ divides into $1729 = 12^3 + 1^3$ using the sum of cubes factorization.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the concept of Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)\nThe Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which involves a series of steps to reduce the numbers until we find their GCD.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Euclidean algorithm\nWe start by dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then continue the process with the smaller number and the remainder of the division, repeating this until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder will be the GCD.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the Euclidean algorithm with the given numbers\nLet's calculate the GCD of 1729 and 1768 using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n- First step: Divide 1768 by 1729. The quotient is 1 and the remainder is 39.\n- Second step: Divide 1729 by 39. The quotient is 44 and the remainder is 13.\n- Third step: Divide 39 by 13. The quotient is 3 and the remainder is 0.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the GCD\nSince the last non-zero remainder is 13, the GCD of 1729 and 1768 is 13.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$"
