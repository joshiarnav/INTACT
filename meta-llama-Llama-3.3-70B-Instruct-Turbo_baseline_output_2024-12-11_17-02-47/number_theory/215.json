    "problem": "What is the units digit of $13^{2003}$?",
    "solution": "Powers of 13 have the same units digit as the corresponding powers of 3; and $$\n3^1 = 3, \\quad 3^2 = 9, \\quad 3^3 = 27, \\quad 3^4 = 81, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 3^5 = 243.\n$$Since the units digit of $3^1$ is the same as the units digit of $3^5$, units digits of powers of 3 cycle through $3, 9, 7,$ and $1$. Hence the units digit of $3^{2000}$ is $1$, so the units digit of $3^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$. The same is true of the units digit of $13^{2003}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the pattern for the units digit of powers of 13\nTo find the units digit of $13^{2003}$, we first look for a pattern in the units digits of powers of 13. We know that the units digit of $13^1$ is 3.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the units digits of higher powers of 13 to identify a repeating pattern\nLet's calculate the units digits of higher powers of 13:\n- $13^1$ = 13, so the units digit is 3.\n- $13^2$ = 169, so the units digit is 9.\n- $13^3$ = 2197, so the units digit is 7.\n- $13^4$ = 28561, so the units digit is 1.\n- $13^5$ = 371293, so the units digit is 3.\nWe notice that the units digits repeat every 4 powers: 3, 9, 7, 1, then cycle back to 3.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the position of $13^{2003}$ in the pattern\nSince the pattern repeats every 4 powers, we divide 2003 by 4 to find the remainder, which tells us where $13^{2003}$ falls in the pattern.\n2003 divided by 4 is 500 with a remainder of 3. This means $13^{2003}$ has the same units digit as $13^3$.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the units digit of $13^{2003}$\nGiven that $13^{2003}$ corresponds to $13^3$ in the pattern, and knowing the units digit of $13^3$ is 7, we conclude that the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is also 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
