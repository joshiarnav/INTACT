    "problem": "A positive five-digit integer is in the form $AB,CBA$; where $A$, $B$ and $C$ are each distinct digits. What is the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven?",
    "solution": "We can test an integer for divisibility by $11$ by alternately adding and subtracting its digits.  For example, $8162$ is divisible by 11 because $8-1+6-2=11$ is divisible by 11.  In this case, $2A-2B+C$ must be divisible by 11.  If there are satisfactory values of $B$ and $C$ corresponding to $A=9$, then the resulting integer would be larger than any integer with $A<9$.  Therefore, we try $A=9$ first.  If $A=9$, then $C-2B+18$ must be divisible by $11$.  Equivalently, $C-2B$ equals $-7$ or $4$, which implies $C=2B-7$ or $C=2B+4$.  Wanting to make $B$ as large as possible, we try $B=9,8,7,\\ldots$. $B$ cannot be $9$ because $A$, $B$, and $C$ must be distinct.  If $B=8$, then $C=9$, so again the digits are not distinct.  If $B=7$, then $C=7$ and still the digits are not distinct.  If $B=6$, then $C=5$, and $AB,\\!CBA=\\boxed{96,\\!569}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a positive five-digit integer in the form $AB,CBA$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct digits. Our goal is to find the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the divisibility rule for 11\nTo determine if a number is divisible by 11, we use the alternating sum of its digits. For the number $AB,CBA$, this means calculating $A - B + C - B + A$. If the result is divisible by 11, then the original number is also divisible by 11.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation based on the divisibility rule\nThe equation based on the divisibility rule for 11 is $A - B + C - B + A = 2A - 2B + C$. For $AB,CBA$ to be divisible by 11, $2A - 2B + C$ must be divisible by 11.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the possible values for A, B, and C\nSince $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct digits, they can range from 0 to 9. However, $A$ cannot be 0 because $AB,CBA$ is a five-digit number. We need to find the greatest possible value for $AB,CBA$, so we start with the highest possible value for $A$, which is 9.\n\n## Step 5: Find the greatest possible value for AB,CBA divisible by 11\nStarting with $A = 9$, we need to find values of $B$ and $C$ such that $2A - 2B + C$ is divisible by 11. Substituting $A = 9$ into the equation gives $18 - 2B + C$. We look for the largest possible $B$ that can satisfy the equation with a distinct $C$. Since we're aiming for the greatest possible number, we should start checking from the largest possible values for $B$ and see if we can find a suitable $C$ that makes $18 - 2B + C$ divisible by 11.\n\n## Step 6: Test values for B and C\nGiven $A = 9$, let's test a high value for $B$, such as $B = 8$. Substituting $B = 8$ into the equation gives $18 - 2(8) + C = 18 - 16 + C = 2 + C$. For this to be divisible by 11, $C$ would need to be 9, which is already taken by $A$. So, $B = 8$ is not a viable option. We continue this process, trying different values for $B$ and solving for $C$ until we find a combination that works.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for B and C\nLet's try $B = 6$. Substituting $B = 6$ into the equation gives $18 - 2(6) + C = 18 - 12 + C = 6 + C$. For $6 + C$ to be divisible by 11, $C$ needs to be 5, because $6 + 5 = 11$, which is divisible by 11. So, $A = 9$, $B = 6$, and $C = 5$ is a valid combination.\n\n## Step 8: Construct the greatest possible AB,CBA\nUsing $A = 9$, $B = 6$, and $C = 5$, the greatest possible value for $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven is $96569$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{96569}$"
