    "problem": "Let $g(n)$ be the product of the proper positive integer divisors of $n$. (Recall that a proper divisor of $n$ is a divisor other than $n$.) For how many values of $n$ does $n$ not divide $g(n)$, given that $2 \\le n \\le 50$?",
    "solution": "If $n$ is prime, then $g(n) = 1$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. The primes less than or equal to $50$ are $$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.$$There are $15$ of these primes. Also, if $n$ is the square of a prime, then $g(n) = \\sqrt{n}$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. By looking at the list of primes we already generated, we see that there are four perfect squares of primes less than $50$. If $n$ is any other composite integer, then it can be decomposed into the product of integers $a$ and $b$ with both integers greater than $1$. We have that $ab$ divides $g(n)$ (since $g(n)$ is the product of a collection of integers including $a$ and $b$). Since $ab=n$, this implies that $n$ divides $g(n)$. As a result, there are $15 + 4 = \\boxed{19}$ values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the function g(n) and understand the conditions for n to not divide g(n)\nThe function $g(n)$ is defined as the product of the proper positive integer divisors of $n$. For $n$ to not divide $g(n)$, it means that $n$ cannot be expressed as a product of its proper divisors.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the cases where n cannot be expressed as a product of its proper divisors\nThere are two main cases where $n$ cannot be expressed as a product of its proper divisors: (1) when $n$ is a prime number, and (2) when $n$ is the square of a prime number.\n\n## Step 3: Count the number of prime numbers between 2 and 50\nThe prime numbers between 2 and 50 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47. There are 15 prime numbers in this range.\n\n## Step 4: Count the number of perfect squares of prime numbers between 2 and 50\nThe perfect squares of prime numbers between 2 and 50 are: 4, 9, 25, and 49. There are 4 perfect squares of prime numbers in this range.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of values of n for which n does not divide g(n)\nTo find the total number of values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$, we add the number of prime numbers and the number of perfect squares of prime numbers: $15 + 4 = 19$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$"
