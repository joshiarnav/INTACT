    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, we need to solve the given system of congruences.\nTo find the value of $x$ that satisfies both $4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$ and $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$, we should start by simplifying or solving these congruences individually.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the first congruence $4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$.\nWe can simplify this by dividing both sides by 4, which is a common factor of 4 and 8, yielding $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$, since dividing the modulus 20 by the greatest common factor of 20 and 4 (which is 4) gives 5.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the second congruence $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$.\nTo simplify, we can try to find an $x$ that satisfies this equation by inspecting possible values or using the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse of 3 modulo 20. However, given that 3 and 20 are relatively prime, we can find the modular inverse of 3 mod 20, which is 7 (since $3*7 = 21 \\equiv 1\\pmod{20}$), and then multiply both sides by 7 to get $x\\equiv 7*16\\pmod{20}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $7*16\\pmod{20}$.\n$7*16 = 112$, and $112\\pmod{20}$ is 12, so $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine if there's a unique solution for $x$ that satisfies both congruences within the modulus 20.\nGiven $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$ from the first congruence and $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$ from the second, we notice that 12 also satisfies $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$ because $12\\pmod{5}$ equals 2. Thus, $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$ is a solution that satisfies both given congruences.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $x^2$ and find the remainder when divided by 20.\nGiven $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$, $x^2\\equiv 12^2\\pmod{20}$. So, $12^2 = 144$, and $144\\pmod{20}$ equals 4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
