    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nWe are given two numbers, $a$ and $b$. When $a$ is divided by 45, the remainder is 37. When $b$ is divided by 30, the remainder is 9. We need to find the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15.\n\n## Step 2: Express $a$ and $b$ in terms of their remainders\nWe can express $a$ as $a = 45q_1 + 37$, where $q_1$ is the quotient when $a$ is divided by 45. Similarly, we can express $b$ as $b = 30q_2 + 9$, where $q_2$ is the quotient when $b$ is divided by 30.\n\n## Step 3: Add $a$ and $b$ to find $a+b$\nNow, let's add $a$ and $b$ to find $a+b$. $a+b = (45q_1 + 37) + (30q_2 + 9)$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression for $a+b$\nSimplifying the expression, we get $a+b = 45q_1 + 30q_2 + 46$.\n\n## Step 5: Rewrite the expression to find the remainder when divided by 15\nWe can rewrite $45q_1$ as $15(3q_1)$ and $30q_2$ as $15(2q_2)$. So, $a+b = 15(3q_1 + 2q_2) + 46$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15\nNow, let's find the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15. Since $15(3q_1 + 2q_2)$ is divisible by 15, the remainder will be the remainder when 46 is divided by 15.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the remainder when 46 is divided by 15\nWhen 46 is divided by 15, the quotient is 3 and the remainder is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
