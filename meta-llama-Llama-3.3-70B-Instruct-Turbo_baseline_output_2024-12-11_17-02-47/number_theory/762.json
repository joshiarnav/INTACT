    "problem": "Find the units digit of $n$ given that $mn = 21^6$ and $m$ has a units digit of 7.",
    "solution": "The units digit of $mn$ is $1^6 = 1$.  Searching for a units digit for $n$ (which is clearly odd), we find that $7 \\cdot 3 = 1$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit of $n$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall that the units digit of powers of 1 is always 1.\nSince $21^6$ ends in $1^6$, the units digit of $21^6$ is 1.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the relationship between the units digits of $m$, $n$, and $mn$.\nThe units digit of the product $mn$ is the product of the units digits of $m$ and $n$. We are given that the units digit of $m$ is 7 and the units digit of $mn$ is 1.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the units digit of $n$.\nTo find the units digit of $n$, we need to find a number that when multiplied by 7 gives a units digit of 1. The multiplication table for 7 shows that $7 \\times 3 = 21$, which means the units digit of $n$ must be 3 because $7 \\times 3$ ends in 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
