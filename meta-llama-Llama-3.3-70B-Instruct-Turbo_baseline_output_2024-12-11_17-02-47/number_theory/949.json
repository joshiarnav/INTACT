    "problem": "The solution of $8x+1\\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$ is $x\\equiv a\\pmod{m}$ for some positive integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a<m$. Find $a+m$.",
    "solution": "Subtract 1 from both sides to obtain $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$. Add 12 to the right-hand side to get $8x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{12}$. Now divide both sides by 8, remembering to divide 12 by the greatest common factor of 12 and 8, thus obtaining $x \\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. This gives $a+m = 2 + 3 = \\boxed{5}$. Here we have used the fact that $ad \\equiv bd\\pmod{m}$ if and only if $a\\equiv b \\pmod{m/\\text{gcd}(m,d)}$, for integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a$, $b$, and $d$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given congruence equation\nThe given equation is $8x + 1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$. This means that $8x + 1$ and $5$ leave the same remainder when divided by $12$.\n\n## Step 2: Subtract 1 from both sides of the equation\nSubtracting 1 from both sides gives $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor of 8 and 12\nThe greatest common divisor of 8 and 12 is 4. Dividing both sides of the equation by 4 gives $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, since dividing the modulus 12 by the greatest common divisor 4 results in a new modulus of 3.\n\n## Step 4: Find the modular inverse of 2 modulo 3\nTo solve $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, we need to find the modular inverse of 2 modulo 3. The modular inverse of 2 modulo 3 is 2, since $2 \\times 2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n\n## Step 5: Multiply both sides of the equation by the modular inverse\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the values of $a$ and $m$\nFrom the equation $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, $a = 2$ and $m = 3$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate $a + m$\nAdding $a$ and $m$ gives $2 + 3 = 5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
