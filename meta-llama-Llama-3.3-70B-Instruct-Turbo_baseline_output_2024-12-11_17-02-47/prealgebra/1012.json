    "solution": "In general, to express the number $0.\\overline{n}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $10x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&10x &=& n&.nnnnn\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.nnnnn\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&9x &=& n &\n\\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\\overline{n} = \\frac{n}{9}$.\n\nHence, our original problem reduces to computing $\\frac 39 + \\frac 29 = \\boxed{\\frac 59}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Express the repeating decimals $0.\\overline{3}$ and $0.\\overline{2}$ as fractions.\n$0.\\overline{3}$ can be represented as $x = 0.333...$. Multiplying $x$ by $10$ gives $10x = 3.333...$. Subtracting $x$ from $10x$ results in $9x = 3$, so $x = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$. Similarly, $0.\\overline{2}$ can be represented as $y = 0.222...$. Multiplying $y$ by $10$ gives $10y = 2.222...$. Subtracting $y$ from $10y$ results in $9y = 2$, so $y = \\frac{2}{9}$.\n\n## Step 2: Add the two fractions together to get the sum.\nThe sum of $0.\\overline{3}$ and $0.\\overline{2}$ is $\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9}$. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is $9$. So, we convert $\\frac{1}{3}$ to $\\frac{3}{9}$.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the addition.\n$\\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$"
