    "problem": "What is the greatest common multiple of 8 and 12 that is less than 90?",
    "solution": "Recall that the common multiples of a set of integers are precisely the multiples of the least common multiple of the set. In this case, the common multiples are integers of the form $24k$ (where $k$ is an integer), since 24 is the least common multiple of 8 and 12. Since $24(3)=72$ and $24(4)=96>90$, the greatest common multiple of 8 and 12 less than 90 is $\\boxed{72}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Find the multiples of 8 less than 90\nFirst, we need to list out the multiples of 8 that are less than 90. These are 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, and 80.\n\n## Step 2: Find the multiples of 12 less than 90\nNext, we list out the multiples of 12 that are less than 90. These are 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the common multiples\nFrom the lists in steps 1 and 2, we identify the common multiples of 8 and 12 that are less than 90. These are 24, 48, and 72.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the greatest common multiple less than 90\nAmong the common multiples identified in step 3, we need to find the greatest one. The greatest common multiple of 8 and 12 that is less than 90 is 72.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{72}$"
