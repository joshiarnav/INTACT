    "problem": "What is the 20th digit after the decimal point of the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$?",
    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$, and that of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $0.\\overline{3}$. The first has a repeating block of 6 digits and the second has a repeating block of 1 digit, so we believe the repeating block of the sum will have 6 digits and try adding the first 6 digits of each decimal representation.  $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}& & &. &1 & 4 & \\stackrel{1}{2} & 8 & \\stackrel{1}{5} & 7\\\\& +& &. &3 &3 & 3 & 3& 3 & 3\\\\ \\cline{1-9} & & & .& 4 &7 & 6 & 1 & 9 & 0\\\\ \\end{array} $$ Notice that continuing the addition past the first six digits will result in repeating blocks of the same six digits ($.142857+.333333=.476190$), so the decimal representation of the sum is $0.\\overline{476190}$. Since 20 divided by 6 has a remainder of 2, the 20th digit following the decimal point is the same as the second digit following the decimal point, which is $\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Convert the fraction $\\frac{1}{7}$ to its decimal equivalent.\nTo convert $\\frac{1}{7}$ to a decimal, we perform long division to find that $\\frac{1}{7} = 0.\\overline{142857}$.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the fraction $\\frac{1}{3}$ to its decimal equivalent.\nTo convert $\\frac{1}{3}$ to a decimal, we perform long division to find that $\\frac{1}{3} = 0.\\overline{3}$.\n\n## Step 3: Sum the decimal equivalents of $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nThe sum of $0.\\overline{142857}$ and $0.\\overline{3}$ can be found by adding the repeating decimals. Since $0.\\overline{3}$ is equivalent to $0.333...$, we can add the decimals as follows:\n$0.142857142857...$\n$+0.333333333333...$\n$0.476190476190...$\n\n## Step 4: Identify the 20th digit after the decimal point in the sum.\nThe repeating pattern of the sum is $476190$. To find the 20th digit after the decimal point, we first determine the length of the repeating pattern, which is 6 digits. We then divide 20 by 6 to find how many complete cycles of the pattern occur before reaching the 20th digit. $20 \\div 6 = 3$ with a remainder of 2, indicating that the 20th digit is the 2nd digit in the repeating pattern.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the 2nd digit in the repeating pattern.\nThe repeating pattern is $476190$, and the 2nd digit in this pattern is $7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
