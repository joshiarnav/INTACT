    "problem": "Piravena must make a trip from $A$ to $B$, then from $B$ to $C$, then from $C$ to $A$.  Each of these three parts of the trip is made entirely by bus or entirely by airplane.  The cities form a right-angled triangle as shown, with $C$ a distance of 3000 km from $A$ and with $B$ a distance of 3250 km from $A$. To take a bus, it costs Piravena $\\$0.15$ per kilometer. To take an airplane, it costs her a $\\$100$ booking fee, plus $\\$0.10$ per kilometer.

    "solution": "Since $\\triangle ABC$ is a right-angled triangle, then we may use the Pythagorean Theorem.\nThus, $AB^2=BC^2+CA^2$, and so  \\begin{align*}\nBC^2&=AB^2-CA^2\\\\\n&=3250^2-3000^2\\\\\n&=250^2(13^2-12^2)\\\\\n&=250^2(5^2)\\\\\n&=1250^2.\n\\end{align*} therefore $BC=1250$ km (since $BC>0$).\nPiravena travels a distance of $3250+1250+3000=\\boxed{7500}$ km for her complete trip.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the distance Piravena travels for her complete trip, we first need to determine the distances between each pair of cities.\nThe distance from $A$ to $B$ is given as 3250 km, and the distance from $A$ to $C$ is given as 3000 km.\n\n## Step 2: We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance from $B$ to $C$, since the cities form a right-angled triangle.\nAccording to the Pythagorean Theorem, in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\n## Step 3: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $AB^2 = BC^2 + AC^2$, where $AB = 3250$ km and $AC = 3000$ km.\nRearranging the equation to solve for $BC$, we get $BC^2 = AB^2 - AC^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Plugging in the given values, we find $BC^2 = 3250^2 - 3000^2$.\nSimplifying this expression gives $BC^2 = 10562500 - 9000000$.\n\n## Step 5: Continuing the calculation, $BC^2 = 1562500$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $BC = \\sqrt{1562500}$.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluating the square root, $BC = 1250$ km.\nSo, the distance from $B$ to $C$ is 1250 km.\n\n## Step 7: Now, we can find the total distance Piravena travels by adding up the distances of each part of the trip.\nThe total distance is $AB + BC + AC = 3250 + 1250 + 3000$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculating the total distance, we get $3250 + 1250 + 3000 = 7500$ km.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7500}$"
