    "problem": "A teacher has a class with $24$ students in it. If she wants to split the students into equal groups of at most $10$ students each, what is the least number of groups that she needs?",
    "solution": "For the teacher to be able to split her students into $x$ groups of $y$ students each, $y$ must be a divisor of $24$. Since we want to create as few groups as possible, we need to maximize the number of students in each group. Thus, $y$ should be the greatest divisor of $24$ that is less than or equal to $10$. This means that $y=8$ and $x=3$. The teacher can create $\\boxed{3}$ groups of $8$ students each.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the total number of students in the class.\nThe total number of students in the class is given as 24.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the maximum number of students allowed per group.\nThe maximum number of students allowed per group is given as 10.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the least number of groups needed by dividing the total number of students by the maximum number of students per group.\nTo find the least number of groups, we divide the total number of students (24) by the maximum number of students per group (10). This gives us 24 / 10 = 2.4.\n\n## Step 4: Round up to the nearest whole number since we cannot have a fraction of a group.\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need to round up 2.4 to 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
