    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Translate the given problem into an equation\nThe problem states that one-half of one-seventh of $T$ equals one-third of one-fifth of 90. We can write this as an equation: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{7} \\times T = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{5} \\times 90$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation\nSimplifying the left side of the equation gives $\\frac{T}{14}$, and simplifying the right side gives $\\frac{90}{15}$, which further simplifies to $6$. So, the equation becomes $\\frac{T}{14} = 6$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $T$\nTo solve for $T$, we multiply both sides of the equation by $14$, resulting in $T = 6 \\times 14$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the value of $T$\nPerforming the multiplication gives $T = 84$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{84}$"
