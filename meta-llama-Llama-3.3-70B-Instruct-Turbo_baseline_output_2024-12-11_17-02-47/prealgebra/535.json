    "problem": "We have a cube with 4 blue faces and 2 red faces.  What's the probability that when it is rolled, a blue face will be facing up?",
    "solution": "We have 6 equally likely outcomes, corresponding to the 6 faces of the cube.  4 of those 6 outcomes are successful ones (meaning a blue face is facing up).  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of faces on the cube\nA cube has a total of 6 faces.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of blue faces on the cube\nThe cube has 4 blue faces.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the probability of a blue face facing up when the cube is rolled\nThe probability of a blue face facing up is calculated by dividing the number of blue faces by the total number of faces on the cube. So, the probability = number of blue faces / total number of faces = 4 / 6 = 2 / 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$"
