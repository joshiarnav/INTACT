    "problem": "A car travels 40 kph for 20 kilometers, 50 kph for 25 kilometers, 60 kph for 45 minutes and 48 kph for 15 minutes. What is the average speed of the car, in kph?",
    "solution": "To find the average speed for the entire trip, we need to divide the total distance by the total time.  Remembering that $d=r\\cdot t$, and looking at each of the four parts of the trip, these pieces can be determined.\n\nFirst, a car traveling at 40 kph for 20 km will be traveling for $20/40=.5$ hours.  Next, a car traveling at 50 kph for 25 km will be traveling for $25/50=.5$ hours.  Next, a car traveling at 60 kph for 45 minutes (.75 hours) will travel a total of $60\\times .75=45$ km during that time.  Finally, a car traveling 48 kph for 15 minutes (.25 hours) will travel a total of $48\\times .25=12$ km.\n\nThe total distance traveled was $20+25+45+12=102$ km.  The total time was $.5+.5+.75+.25=2$ hours.  Therefore, the average speed of the car was $102/2=\\boxed{51}$ kph.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the time taken for the first part of the journey\nTo find the time taken for the first part of the journey, we use the formula time = distance / speed. For the first part, the car travels 20 kilometers at 40 kph. So, time = 20 km / 40 kph = 0.5 hours.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the time taken for the second part of the journey\nFor the second part, the car travels 25 kilometers at 50 kph. Using the same formula, time = 25 km / 50 kph = 0.5 hours.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the distance and time taken for the third part of the journey\nFor the third part, the car travels at 60 kph for 45 minutes. First, convert the time to hours: 45 minutes = 45 / 60 = 0.75 hours. Then, find the distance traveled: distance = speed * time = 60 kph * 0.75 hours = 45 km.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the distance and time taken for the fourth part of the journey\nFor the fourth part, the car travels at 48 kph for 15 minutes. Convert the time to hours: 15 minutes = 15 / 60 = 0.25 hours. Then, find the distance traveled: distance = speed * time = 48 kph * 0.25 hours = 12 km.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total distance traveled\nAdd up the distances from all parts of the journey: total distance = 20 km + 25 km + 45 km + 12 km = 102 km.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total time taken\nAdd up the times from all parts of the journey: total time = 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours + 0.75 hours + 0.25 hours = 2 hours.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the average speed\nThe average speed is calculated using the formula average speed = total distance / total time. So, average speed = 102 km / 2 hours = 51 kph.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{51}$"
