    "problem": "The average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $4x-7$. What is $x$?",
    "solution": "The average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $\\dfrac{1}{3}((x+6)+(6x+2)+(2x+7))$. Simplifying this expression gives $\\dfrac{1}{3}(9x+15)=3x+5$. We know the average is also $4x-7$, so $3x+5=4x-7$. Subtracting $3x-7$ from both sides of this equation gives $x=\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Write down the given information\nThe average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $4x-7$.\n\n## Step 2: Express the average using a formula\nThe average of three numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ is given by $\\frac{a+b+c}{3}$. Applying this to the given numbers, we get $\\frac{(x+6) + (6x+2) + (2x+7)}{3} = 4x-7$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the equation\nCombine like terms in the numerator: $\\frac{x+6+6x+2+2x+7}{3} = 4x-7$. This simplifies to $\\frac{9x+15}{3} = 4x-7$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $x$\nDistribute the division by 3: $9x+15 = 3(4x-7)$. This simplifies to $9x+15 = 12x-21$.\n\n## Step 5: Rearrange the equation to isolate $x$\nSubtract $9x$ from both sides: $15 = 3x-21$. Add 21 to both sides: $36 = 3x$. Divide both sides by 3: $12 = x$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
