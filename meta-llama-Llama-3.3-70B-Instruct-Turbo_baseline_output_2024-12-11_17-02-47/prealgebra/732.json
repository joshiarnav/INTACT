    "problem": "Amanda, Ben, and Carlos share a sum of money. Their portions are in the ratio of 1:2:7, respectively. If Amanda's portion is $\\$$20, what is the total amount of money shared?",
    "solution": "We multiply each part of the ratio $1:2:7$ by 20 to make Amanda's part equal 20, and we have \\[1:2:7 = 1\\cdot 20:2\\cdot 20 :7\\cdot 20 = 20:40:140.\\] This means that  Ben's share is $2\\times 20 = 40$ dollars and Carlos's share is $7\\times 20=140$ dollars.  Therefore, the total amount of money shared is $20+40+140=\\boxed{200}$ dollars.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the ratio of the portions\nThe portions are in the ratio of 1:2:7 for Amanda, Ben, and Carlos, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Find the factor by which the ratio is multiplied to get the actual amounts\nSince Amanda's portion is $\\$$20 and her ratio is 1, we can find the factor by which the ratio is multiplied. This factor is 20.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the actual amounts received by each person\nAmanda's portion is 1 * 20 = $\\$$20. Ben's portion is 2 * 20 = $\\$$40. Carlos's portion is 7 * 20 = $\\$$140.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money shared\nThe total amount of money shared is the sum of the portions received by Amanda, Ben, and Carlos. Total amount = $\\$$20 + $\\$$40 + $\\$$140 = $\\$$200.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{200}$"
