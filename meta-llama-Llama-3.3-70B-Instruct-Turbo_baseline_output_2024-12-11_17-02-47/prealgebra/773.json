    "problem": "If $x$ is a positive multiple of 8 and $x^2>100$, but $x<20$, what is $x$?",
    "solution": "This question gives multiple clues on what $x$ could be. Because $x^2>100$, we know that $x$ must be greater than 10, but $x$ is also less than 20. So $x$ is a multiple of 8 that is between 10 and 20. The only value that fits this description is $\\boxed{16}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the conditions given for x\nWe are given that x is a positive multiple of 8, $x^2 > 100$, and $x < 20$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the inequality $x^2 > 100$\nTo solve $x^2 > 100$, we take the square root of both sides, remembering to consider both the positive and negative square roots due to the nature of inequalities involving squares. This gives us $x > 10$ or $x < -10$. Since x is stated to be a positive multiple of 8, we only consider $x > 10$.\n\n## Step 3: Combine the conditions to find possible values of x\nGiven that x is a positive multiple of 8 and $x > 10$, and also $x < 20$, we need to find the multiples of 8 within the range $10 < x < 20$. The multiples of 8 in this range are 16.\n\n## Step 4: Verify that the possible value of x satisfies all conditions\nWe verify that 16 is indeed a positive multiple of 8, $16^2 = 256 > 100$, and $16 < 20$. Thus, 16 satisfies all given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$"
