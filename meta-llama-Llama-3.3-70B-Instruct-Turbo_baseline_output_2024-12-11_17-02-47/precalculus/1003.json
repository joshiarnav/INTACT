    "model_solution": "## Step 1: The equation of the plane is given by $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$. We are looking for the point on this plane that is closest to the point $(1,2,3)$.\nTo find the closest point, we need to find the line perpendicular to the plane that passes through the given point.\n\n## Step 2: The direction vector of this line is the same as the normal vector of the plane, which is $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -4 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThis vector is used to parameterize the line that passes through the point $(1,2,3)$.\n\n## Step 3: The parametric equations of the line can be written as $x = 1 + 3t$, $y = 2 - 4t$, and $z = 3 + 5t$, where $t$ is a parameter.\nWe substitute these equations into the equation of the plane to find the point of intersection.\n\n## Step 4: Substituting $x = 1 + 3t$, $y = 2 - 4t$, and $z = 3 + 5t$ into $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$, we get $3(1 + 3t) - 4(2 - 4t) + 5(3 + 5t) = 30$.\nThis simplifies to $3 + 9t - 8 + 16t + 15 + 25t = 30$, which further simplifies to $50t + 10 = 30$.\n\n## Step 5: Solving the equation $50t + 10 = 30$ for $t$, we get $50t = 20$ and thus $t = \\frac{20}{50} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\nNow we substitute $t = \\frac{2}{5}$ back into the parametric equations of the line to find the coordinates of the point.\n\n## Step 6: Substituting $t = \\frac{2}{5}$ into $x = 1 + 3t$, $y = 2 - 4t$, and $z = 3 + 5t$, we get $x = 1 + 3(\\frac{2}{5}) = 1 + \\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{11}{5}$, $y = 2 - 4(\\frac{2}{5}) = 2 - \\frac{8}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}$, and $z = 3 + 5(\\frac{2}{5}) = 3 + 2 = 5$.\nSo, the point on the plane closest to $(1,2,3)$ is $\\left(\\frac{11}{5}, \\frac{2}{5}, 5\\right)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{11}{5}, \\frac{2}{5}, 5\\right)}$"
