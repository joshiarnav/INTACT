    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Start by analyzing the given equation\nWe have the equation $a^3 b^5 = a^7 b^2 = 1$. This equation implies that $a^3 b^5 = 1$ and $a^7 b^2 = 1$.\n\n## Step 2: Manipulate the given equations to simplify\nFrom $a^3 b^5 = 1$, we can raise both sides to the power of 2 to get $a^6 b^{10} = 1$. Similarly, from $a^7 b^2 = 1$, we can raise both sides to the power of 5 to get $a^{35} b^{10} = 1$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the results from step 2 to find a relationship between $a$ and $b$\nDividing the equation $a^{35} b^{10} = 1$ by $a^6 b^{10} = 1$, we obtain $a^{29} = 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the equation $a^{29} = 1$\nThis equation implies that $a$ must be a 29th root of unity.\n\n## Step 5: Use the equation $a^7 b^2 = 1$ to find $b$ in terms of $a$\nRearranging the equation $a^7 b^2 = 1$, we get $b^2 = a^{-7}$, or $b = a^{-7/2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the possible values for $a$ and $b$\nSince $a$ is a 29th root of unity, there are 29 possible values for $a$. For each $a$, $b$ is uniquely determined as $b = a^{-7/2}$.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the restrictions on $a$ and $b$ due to the original equation\nGiven $a^3 b^5 = 1$, substituting $b = a^{-7/2}$ yields $a^3 (a^{-7/2})^5 = 1$, which simplifies to $a^3 a^{-35/2} = 1$, or $a^{-23/2} = 1$. This implies $a^{23} = 1$, meaning $a$ must also be a 23rd root of unity.\n\n## Step 8: Find the common roots that satisfy both conditions for $a$\nThe values of $a$ that satisfy both $a^{29} = 1$ and $a^{23} = 1$ are the roots that are common to both, which means $a$ must be a root of unity for the least common multiple of 29 and 23.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of 29 and 23\nThe LCM of 29 and 23 is $29 \\times 23 = 667$.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the number of ordered pairs\nSince $a$ must be a 667th root of unity and $b = a^{-7/2}$, there are as many ordered pairs $(a, b)$ as there are 667th roots of unity.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{29}$"
