    "solution": "Two angles have the same tangent if and only if they differ by a multiple of $\\pi.$  This means $\\tan x - x$ is a multiple of $\\pi.$  Let\n\\[T(x) = \\tan x - x.\\]First, we prove that the function $T(x)$ is strictly increasing on the interval $\\left[ 0, \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right).$  Let $0 \\le x < y < \\frac{\\pi}{2}.$  Then\n\\[y - x < \\tan (y - x) = \\frac{\\tan y - \\tan x}{1 + \\tan x \\tan y} \\le \\tan y - \\tan x.\\]Re-arranging, we get $\\tan x - x < \\tan y - y,$ or $T(x) < T(y).$\n\nNote that as $x$ approaches $\\frac{\\pi}{2},$ $T(x)$ approaches infinity.  This means for every nonnegative integer $n,$ there exists a unique value of $x$ such that $T(x) = n \\pi.$\n\nWe have the estimate $300 \\pi \\approx 942.48.$  Hence,\n\\[T(\\tan^{-1} 942) = 942 - \\tan^{-1} 942 < 942 < 300 \\pi.\\]Also,\n\\[T(\\tan^{-1} 924) = 942 - \\tan^{-1} 942 > 942 - \\frac{\\pi}{2} > 299 \\pi.\\]Since $299 \\pi < T(\\tan^{-1} 942) < 300 \\pi,$ the equation $T(x) = n \\pi$ has a solution on the interval $[0, \\tan^{-1} 942]$ if and only if $0 \\le n < 300,$ so there are $\\boxed{300}$ solutions.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the equation\nThe equation given is $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$. This implies that either $x = \\tan x + k\\pi$ or $\\tan x = k\\pi$ for some integer $k$, because the tangent function has period $\\pi$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the range of $\\tan x$\nWe are looking for solutions on the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$. Since $\\tan x$ is strictly increasing on the interval $(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, $\\tan^{-1} 942$ is the unique value $x$ such that $\\tan x = 942$.\n\n## Step 3: Finding the bounds for $k$\nFrom the equation $x = \\tan x + k\\pi$, we know that $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$. For $k = 0$, we have $x = \\tan x$, which has a solution $x = 0$. For positive $k$, we need to find how many $k$ satisfy the inequality $0 \\le \\tan x - k\\pi \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$.\n\n## Step 4: Determining the maximum $k$\nWe know that $\\tan x > x$ for $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, the maximum value of $k$ can be found from $\\tan^{-1} 942 > k\\pi$, because $\\tan x$ must be greater than $x$ but less than $\\tan^{-1} 942$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the maximum $k$\nSince $\\tan^{-1} 942 < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we can calculate $k$ using $\\frac{\\tan^{-1} 942}{\\pi} > k$. However, because $\\tan x$ is not directly proportional to $x$, we should consider the inequality $\\tan^{-1} 942 > k\\pi$ to find the maximum $k$. We can approximate or compute the value of $\\tan^{-1} 942$ and divide it by $\\pi$ to get an estimate for $k$.\n\n## Step 6: Finding the number of solutions\nGiven the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$, we need to count how many times the graph of $y = \\tan x$ intersects the graph of $y = x + k\\pi$ for different values of $k$. Each intersection represents a solution to the equation.\n\n## Step 7: Calculating the final answer\nTo find the number of solutions, we calculate the maximum $k$ for which $k\\pi < \\tan^{-1} 942$. Given that $\\tan^{-1} 942 \\approx 1.5708$ (close to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$) and $942$ is the $\\tan x$ value, we find $k$ by $\\frac{\\tan^{-1} 942}{\\pi}$. However, this step is to understand the process; the real calculation involves recognizing that each $k$ adds a solution, and there's an initial solution at $x = 0$.\n\n## Step 8: Identifying the relationship between $\\tan x$ and $x$\nSince $\\tan x > x$ for $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the number of solutions is related to how many times $\\tan x$ intersects $x + k\\pi$ within the given interval. Essentially, each time $\\tan x$ exceeds $k\\pi$, there's a solution until $\\tan x$ reaches $942$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculating $k$\nThe value of $\\tan^{-1} 942$ is slightly less than $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. To find the maximum $k$, we use $\\frac{\\tan^{-1} 942}{\\pi} \\approx 0.5$. However, since $k$ must be an integer, and we're looking for how many $k\\pi$ fit into the range of $\\tan x$ from $0$ to $942$, we consider the integer part of $\\frac{942}{\\pi}$, recognizing that each $k$ represents a cycle of $\\tan x$ that intersects the line $y = x$.\n\n## Step 10: Finding the number of cycles\nSince $\\frac{942}{\\pi} \\approx 299.67$, and considering that each cycle of $\\tan x$ corresponds to a solution, we look at the integer part, which suggests approximately $299$ cycles. However, this is an approximation to understand the scale; the precise calculation directly relates to the unique solutions within the specified interval.\n\n## Step 11: Accounting for the initial solution\nIn addition to the solutions represented by the cycles of $\\tan x$, there's an initial solution at $x = 0$, which satisfies $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$.\n\n## Step 12: Final calculation\nConsidering the nature of $\\tan x$ and its periodicity, the number of solutions within the given interval, including the solution at $x = 0$, is directly related to the number of times $\\tan x$ intersects the lines $y = x + k\\pi$ within that interval. This involves recognizing that for each integer $k$, there's a corresponding intersection until $\\tan x$ reaches $942$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{300}$"
