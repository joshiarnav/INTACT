    "solution": "Since $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$, we have that $0 < \\cos x \\le 1$. Thus, $0 < \\sqrt{\\cos x} \\le 1$. Since the range of $\\log_2 x$ for $0<x\\le1$ is all non-positive numbers, the range of the entire function is all non-positive numbers, or $\\boxed{(-\\infty,0]}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the restrictions on the domain of the function due to the presence of the square root and the logarithm.\nThe expression inside the square root, $\\cos x$, must be non-negative, and the expression inside the logarithm, $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$, must be strictly greater than 0. Since $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$, $\\cos x$ is always positive, satisfying both conditions.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the range of $\\cos x$ for $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$.\nThe cosine function varies between 0 and 1 for the given interval, not including 0, because at $-90^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$, $\\cos x = 0$, but these endpoints are not included in the interval.\n\n## Step 3: Find the range of $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$.\nGiven that $\\cos x$ ranges between 0 (exclusive) and 1, $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$ will also range between 0 (exclusive) and 1, since the square root of a number between 0 and 1 is also between 0 and 1.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the range of $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$.\nThe logarithm function $\\log_2 x$ is defined for $x > 0$. Since $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$ ranges from 0 (exclusive) to 1, $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ will range from $-\\infty$ to 0, because $\\log_2 1 = 0$ and as $\\sqrt{\\cos x}$ approaches 0, $\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$ approaches $-\\infty$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(-\\infty,0]}$"
