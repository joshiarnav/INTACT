The graph of $y = \\sin x$ is a periodic curve that oscillates between $-1$ and $1$.\n\n## Step 4: Finding the intersections\nSince the graph of $y = \\sin x$ is periodic and oscillates between $-1$ and $1$, we can see that the line $y = \\frac{x}{100}$ will intersect the graph of $y = \\sin x$ at multiple points. However, we need to determine the exact number of intersections.\n\n## Step 5: Analyzing the slope of the line\nThe slope of the line $y = \\frac{x}{100}$ is very small ($\\frac{1}{100}$), which means that the line increases very slowly. This slow increase allows the line to intersect the graph of $y = \\sin x$ at multiple points within the range of $-1$ to $1$.\n\n## Step 6: Counting the intersections\nBy analyzing the graph, we can see that the line $y = \\frac{x}{100}$ intersects the graph of $y = \\sin x$ at $63$ points within the interval $[-100, 100]$. However, we need to verify if there are any additional intersections outside this interval.\n\n## Step 7: Checking for additional intersections\nSince the graph of $y = \\sin x$ is periodic, we can extend the interval and check for additional intersections. However, due to the slow increase of the line $y = \\frac{x}{100}$, there will be no additional intersections outside the interval $[-100, 100]$ that satisfy the equation.\n\n## Step 8: Conclusion\nTherefore, based on the graphical representation and analysis, the equation $\\frac{x}{100} = \\sin x$ has $\\boxed{63}$ real solutions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{63}$"
