    "solution": "We know that by definition, $i^2=-1$, so $i^4=(-1)^2=1.$ More generally, for all integers k, $i^{4k}=(i^4)^k=1^k=1$. This means that $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}= i^8(i^3)+i^{16}(1)+i^{20}(i)+i^{24}(i^2)+i^{28}(i^3)=i^3+1+i+i^2+i^3$. Since $i^3=-i$, we can simplify this to get our final result: $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}=-i+1+i-1-i=\\boxed{-i}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the properties of the imaginary unit i\nThe imaginary unit i has the property that $i^2 = -1$. This means that $i^3 = i^2 \\cdot i = -i$ and $i^4 = (i^2) \\cdot (i^2) = (-1) \\cdot (-1) = 1$. As a result, powers of i cycle every 4 steps: $i^1 = i$, $i^2 = -1$, $i^3 = -i$, $i^4 = 1$, $i^5 = i$, and so on.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify each power of i using the cycling pattern\nFor $i^{11}$, we divide the exponent by 4 and look at the remainder. $11 \\div 4 = 2$ with a remainder of 3. Since the remainder is 3, $i^{11} = i^3 = -i$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify $i^{16}$\nFor $i^{16}$, $16 \\div 4 = 4$ with a remainder of 0. Since the remainder is 0, $i^{16} = i^0 = 1$ (anything to the power of 0 is 1, and since $i^4 = 1$, any multiple of 4 as an exponent will also result in 1).\n\n## Step 4: Simplify $i^{21}$\nFor $i^{21}$, $21 \\div 4 = 5$ with a remainder of 1. Since the remainder is 1, $i^{21} = i^1 = i$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify $i^{26}$\nFor $i^{26}$, $26 \\div 4 = 6$ with a remainder of 2. Since the remainder is 2, $i^{26} = i^2 = -1$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify $i^{31}$\nFor $i^{31}$, $31 \\div 4 = 7$ with a remainder of 3. Since the remainder is 3, $i^{31} = i^3 = -i$.\n\n## Step 7: Add the simplified expressions together\nNow we add $-i + 1 + i - 1 - i$. The $i$ and $-i$ cancel each other out, as do the $1$ and $-1$, leaving us with $-i$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{- i}$"
