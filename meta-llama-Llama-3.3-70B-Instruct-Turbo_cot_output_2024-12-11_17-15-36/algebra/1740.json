    "problem": "A box with a volume of 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold 50 paperclips. How many paperclips could a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ hold?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of paperclips that a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ could hold. Setting up the ratio $\\frac{50}{16}=\\frac{x}{48}$ and solving for $x$ gives $x=150$.  Hence, a 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ box could hold $\\boxed{150}$ paperclips.  We also could have noted that tripling the size of the box triples the number of paperclips we can hold, so the new box can hold $50\\cdot 3 = 150$ paperclips.",

    "model_solution": "To find out how many paperclips a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold, we first need to establish the ratio of volume to the number of paperclips based on the information given for the 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ box.\n\n1. The given box has a volume of 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ and can hold 50 paperclips.\n2. We need to find out how many paperclips a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold.\n3. First, let's determine the ratio of paperclips to volume for the 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ box. This is calculated as the number of paperclips divided by the volume: 50 paperclips / 16 $\\text{cm}^3$.\n4. Calculate this ratio: 50 / 16 = 3.125 paperclips per $\\text{cm}^3$.\n5. Now, apply this ratio to the 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ box to find out how many paperclips it can hold: 3.125 paperclips per $\\text{cm}^3$ * 48 $\\text{cm}^3$.\n6. Calculate the number of paperclips: 3.125 * 48 = 150.\n\nTherefore, a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ could hold $\\boxed{150}$ paperclips."
