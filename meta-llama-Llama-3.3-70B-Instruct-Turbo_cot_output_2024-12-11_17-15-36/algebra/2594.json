    "problem": "The third and fourth terms of a geometric sequence are 12 and 16, respectively. What is the first term of the sequence?",
    "solution": "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence. Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$. Solving, we have $a\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the first term of the geometric sequence, let's denote the first term as \\(a\\) and the common ratio as \\(r\\).\n\nGiven:\n- The third term of the sequence is 12.\n- The fourth term of the sequence is 16.\n\nIn a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by the common ratio \\(r\\). The general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is \\(a_n = a \\cdot r^{n-1}\\), where \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\nSo, for the third and fourth terms, we have:\n1. \\(a_3 = a \\cdot r^{3-1} = a \\cdot r^2 = 12\\)\n2. \\(a_4 = a \\cdot r^{4-1} = a \\cdot r^3 = 16\\)\n\nFrom these equations, we can solve for \\(r\\) by dividing the equation for the fourth term by the equation for the third term:\n\\[\\frac{a \\cdot r^3}{a \\cdot r^2} = \\frac{16}{12}\\]\n\\[r = \\frac{16}{12}\\]\n\\[r = \\frac{4}{3}\\]\n\nNow that we have \\(r\\), we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for \\(a\\). Using \\(a \\cdot r^2 = 12\\):\n\\[a \\cdot \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12\\]\n\\[a \\cdot \\frac{16}{9} = 12\\]\n\\[a = 12 \\cdot \\frac{9}{16}\\]\n\\[a = \\frac{108}{16}\\]\n\\[a = \\frac{27}{4}\\]\n\nSo, the first term of the sequence is \\(\\frac{27}{4}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$"
