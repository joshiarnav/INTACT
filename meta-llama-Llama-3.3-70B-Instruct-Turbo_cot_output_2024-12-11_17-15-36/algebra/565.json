    "problem": "What is the sum of all values of $k$ such that the equation $2x^2-kx+8=0$ has two distinct integer solutions?",
    "solution": "We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively. Let the two roots of the equation be $p$ and $q$. Then $p+q=k/2$. However the only other restriction on $p$ and $q$ is that $pq = 4$ and that $p$ and $q$ are distinct integers. For each such possibility $(p,q)$, we also have the possibility $(-p,-q)$ since $(-p)(-q) = pq = 4$. This gives two values of $k$: $k=2(p+q)$ and $k=2(-p-q)$. Since these occur in such pairs, the sum of all possible values of $k$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nAlternatively, one can note that the only way to factor 4 into 2 distinct integer factors is $4\\cdot1$ and $(-4)(-1)$, so that the two possible values of $k$ are $10$ and $-10$, given a sum of $0$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Use Vieta's formulas to find the sum and product of the roots.\nFor a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ with roots $r_1$ and $r_2$, Vieta's formulas state that $r_1+r_2=-\\frac{b}{a}$ and $r_1 \\cdot r_2=\\frac{c}{a}$. Applying these formulas to the given equation $2x^2-kx+8=0$, we get $r_1+r_2=\\frac{k}{2}$ and $r_1 \\cdot r_2=\\frac{8}{2}=4$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the possible integer pairs for the roots.\nSince $r_1 \\cdot r_2=4$ and both $r_1$ and $r_2$ are integers, the possible pairs for $(r_1, r_2)$ are $(1, 4)$, $(-1, -4)$, $(2, 2)$, $(-2, -2)$, $(4, 1)$, $(-4, -1)$. However, since the equation has two distinct integer solutions, we exclude the pairs with repeated numbers, which are $(2, 2)$ and $(-2, -2)$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the sum of the roots for each pair.\nFor the pair $(1, 4)$, the sum is $1+4=5$. For $(-1, -4)$, the sum is $-1+(-4)=-5$. Since $(4, 1)$ gives the same sum as $(1, 4)$ and $(-4, -1)$ gives the same sum as $(-1, -4)$, we do not need to calculate those.\n\n## Step 4: Use the sum of the roots to find the corresponding values of $k$.\nFrom Step 1, we have $r_1+r_2=\\frac{k}{2}$. For the sum $5$, we have $5=\\frac{k}{2}$, which gives $k=10$. For the sum $-5$, we have $-5=\\frac{k}{2}$, which gives $k=-10$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the sum of all values of $k$.\nTo find the sum of all possible values of $k$, we add the values found in Step 4: $10 + (-10) = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"
