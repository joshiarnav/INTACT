    "problem": "If a rectangular prism has a length of $l$, a width of $w$, and a height of $h$, then the length of its diagonal is equal to $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}$. Suppose $l = 3$ and $h = 12$; if the length of the diagonal is $13$, what is the width?",
    "solution": "We are given that $$\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + w^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{153 + w^2} = 13.$$Squaring both sides, it follows that $$153 + w^2 = 13^2 = 169 \\quad\\Longrightarrow \\quad w = \\pm 4.$$Since the width must be a positive quantity, the answer is $\\boxed{4}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the formula for the diagonal of a rectangular prism\nThe formula for the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism is $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}$, where $l$ is the length, $w$ is the width, and $h$ is the height.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute the given values into the formula\nGiven that $l = 3$, $h = 12$, and the length of the diagonal is $13$, we can substitute these values into the formula: $\\sqrt{3^2 + w^2 + 12^2} = 13$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $w$\nSquaring both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root: $3^2 + w^2 + 12^2 = 13^2$. This simplifies to $9 + w^2 + 144 = 169$.\n\n## Step 4: Continue solving for $w$\nCombine like terms: $w^2 + 153 = 169$. Subtract 153 from both sides to isolate $w^2$: $w^2 = 169 - 153$.\n\n## Step 5: Final calculation for $w$\nCalculate the value of $w^2$: $w^2 = 16$. Taking the square root of both sides to solve for $w$: $w = \\sqrt{16}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify to find $w$\nSince $\\sqrt{16} = 4$, the width $w$ is $4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
