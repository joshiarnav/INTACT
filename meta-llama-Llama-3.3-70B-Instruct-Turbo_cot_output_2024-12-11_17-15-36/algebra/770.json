    "problem": "Alex has 12 friends and 63 coins. What is the minimum number of additional coins he needs so that he can give each friend at least one coin and no two friends receive the same number of coins?",
    "solution": "Alex wants to minimize the number of coins he gives to his friends without giving any two of them the same number of coins. The minimum number of coins he can give to a friend is 1. He then gives 2 coins to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 12. The total number of coins Alex has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+12 = \\frac{12 \\cdot 13}{2}=78$.  Thus, Alex needs $78-63=\\boxed{15}$ more coins.",

    "model_solution": "To ensure that each of Alex's 12 friends receives at least one coin and that no two friends receive the same number of coins, we can start by giving 1 coin to the first friend, 2 coins to the second friend, 3 coins to the third friend, and so on, until the 12th friend receives 12 coins.\n\nThe total number of coins given away can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 12 = (12 * 13) / 2 = 78\n\nSince Alex currently has 63 coins, we need to find the minimum number of additional coins he needs to achieve this distribution.\n\nAdditional coins needed = Total coins required - Coins Alex currently has\n= 78 - 63\n= 15\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of additional coins Alex needs is 15.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
