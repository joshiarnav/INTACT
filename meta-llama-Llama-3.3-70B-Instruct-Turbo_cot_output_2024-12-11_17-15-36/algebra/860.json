    "problem": "The equation $x^2+ ax = -14$ has only integer solutions for $x$. If $a$ is a positive integer, what is the greatest possible value of $a$?",
    "solution": "The left-hand side factors into $x(x+a)=-14$, so $x$ and $x+a$ both divide $-14$. One of the two factors is negative and the other positive, since their product is negative. $x+a>x$, so $x+a>0$ and $x<0$. This leaves 4 possibilities for $x$, since it is negative and divides $-14$ evenly: $-1$, $-2$, $-7$, and $-14$. $x=-1$ gives $x+a=14$ and therefore $a=15$. Similarly, $x=-2$, $x=-7$, and $x=-14$ give $a=9$, $a=9$, and $a=15$, respectively. The largest value for $a$ is thus $\\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Factor the given equation\nWe start by factoring the given equation $x^2 + ax = -14$. This can be rewritten as $x^2 + ax + 14 = 0$. Factoring this quadratic equation, we get $(x + p)(x + q) = 0$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers.\n\n## Step 2: Express the equation in terms of its factors\nFrom the factored form, we can express the equation as $x^2 + ax + 14 = (x + p)(x + q) = x^2 + (p + q)x + pq$. Therefore, we have $a = p + q$ and $pq = 14$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the pairs of integers whose product is 14\nWe need to find all pairs of integers $(p, q)$ whose product is $14$. The pairs of integers that satisfy this condition are $(1, 14)$, $(-1, -14)$, $(2, 7)$, and $(-2, -7)$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the possible values of $a$\nUsing the pairs of integers from the previous step, we can calculate the possible values of $a$. For $(1, 14)$, $a = 1 + 14 = 15$. For $(-1, -14)$, $a = -1 - 14 = -15$. For $(2, 7)$, $a = 2 + 7 = 9$. For $(-2, -7)$, $a = -2 - 7 = -9$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the greatest possible value of $a$\nSince $a$ must be a positive integer, we can disregard the negative values of $a$ obtained in the previous step. The greatest possible value of $a$ from the remaining options is $15$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
