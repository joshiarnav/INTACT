    "solution": "It is clear that the maximal positive difference is $6 - 1 = 5$. Moreover, we can use 6 to ensure that we can get all positive integer differences up to 5: $6 - 5 = 1$, $6 - 4 = 2$, $6 - 3 = 3$, $6 - 2 = 4$, $6 - 1 = 5$. So, there are $\\boxed{5}$ possible differences.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: List all the possible differences resulting from subtracting the elements of the given set.\nTo find the different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\}$, we first need to calculate all possible differences. The set contains the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the differences between all pairs of distinct numbers in the set.\nThe differences are as follows:\n- $2 - 1 = 1$\n- $3 - 1 = 2$\n- $3 - 2 = 1$\n- $4 - 1 = 3$\n- $4 - 2 = 2$\n- $4 - 3 = 1$\n- $5 - 1 = 4$\n- $5 - 2 = 3$\n- $5 - 3 = 2$\n- $5 - 4 = 1$\n- $6 - 1 = 5$\n- $6 - 2 = 4$\n- $6 - 3 = 3$\n- $6 - 4 = 2$\n- $6 - 5 = 1$\n\n## Step 3: Identify the unique positive integers from the calculated differences.\nLooking at the differences calculated, the unique positive integers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n## Step 4: Count the number of unique positive integers.\nThere are 5 unique positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
