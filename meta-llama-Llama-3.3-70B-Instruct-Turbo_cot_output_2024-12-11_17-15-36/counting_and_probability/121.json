    "problem": "Two standard dice are rolled. What is the expected number of 1's obtained? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability of rolling a number other than 1 on one die is $\\frac{5}{6}$, so the probability of rolling zero 1's on two dice is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{36}$. The probability of rolling a 1 on one die is $\\frac{1}{6}$, so the probability of rolling 1's on two dice (for a total of two 1's) is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{36}$. Since the only other possibility is rolling exactly one 1, the probability of rolling one 1 is $1-\\frac{25}{36}-\\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{10}{36}$. We find the expected number of 1's to be $E = \\frac{1}{36} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{10}{36} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{25}{36} \\cdot 0 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total possible outcomes when rolling two standard dice.\nWhen rolling two standard dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes. Since we are rolling two dice, the total number of outcomes is 6 * 6 = 36.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of outcomes that result in zero 1's.\nTo get zero 1's, we need to consider the outcomes where neither of the dice shows a 1. For each die, there are 5 outcomes (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) that are not a 1. So, the total number of outcomes where neither die shows a 1 is 5 * 5 = 25.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of outcomes that result in exactly one 1.\nTo get exactly one 1, we can have the 1 on the first die and any number other than 1 on the second die, or any number other than 1 on the first die and a 1 on the second die. The number of outcomes for the first scenario is 1 * 5 = 5 (since there's only 1 way to roll a 1 on the first die and 5 ways to roll a non-1 on the second die). The same goes for the second scenario, resulting in another 5 outcomes. So, the total number of outcomes with exactly one 1 is 5 + 5 = 10.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of outcomes that result in exactly two 1's.\nTo get exactly two 1's, we need both dice to show a 1. There is only 1 outcome for this scenario (1,1).\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of each scenario and then the expected number of 1's.\nThe probability of getting zero 1's is 25/36, the probability of getting exactly one 1 is 10/36, and the probability of getting exactly two 1's is 1/36. The expected number of 1's is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing these products: (0 * 25/36) + (1 * 10/36) + (2 * 1/36).\n\n## Step 6: Perform the calculation of the expected number of 1's.\nExpected number of 1's = (0 * 25/36) + (1 * 10/36) + (2 * 1/36) = 0 + 10/36 + 2/36 = 12/36 = 1/3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$"
