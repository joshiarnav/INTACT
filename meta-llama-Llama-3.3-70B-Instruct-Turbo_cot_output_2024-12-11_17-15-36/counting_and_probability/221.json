    "solution": "Since $12! = 12 \\cdot 11!$, we can examine the sum better by factoring $11!$ out of both parts: $$ 11! + 12! = 11! + 12 \\cdot 11! = 11!(1 + 12) = 11! \\cdot 13. $$Since no prime greater than 11 divides $11!$, $\\boxed{13}$ is the largest prime factor of $11! + 12!$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nWe are asked to find the largest prime divisor of the expression $11! + 12!$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the expression\nFirst, let's simplify the given expression. We know that $12! = 12 \\times 11!$, so we can factor out $11!$ from the expression: $11! + 12! = 11! + 12 \\times 11! = 11!(1 + 12) = 11! \\times 13$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the prime factors\nNow, let's consider the prime factors of $11!$ and $13$. $11!$ is the product of all integers from $1$ to $11$, which includes several prime numbers less than or equal to $11$, namely $2, 3, 5, 7, 11$. However, since we are looking for the largest prime divisor of $11! \\times 13$, we should note that $13$ is a prime number itself and is larger than any prime factor present within $11!$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the largest prime divisor\nGiven that $13$ is a prime number and is larger than any prime factor in $11!$, the largest prime divisor of $11! + 12! = 11! \\times 13$ will be $13$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$"
