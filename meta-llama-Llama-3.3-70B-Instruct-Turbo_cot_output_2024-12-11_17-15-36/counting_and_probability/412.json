    "problem": "How many distinct triangles can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube? (Two triangles are distinct if they have different locations in space.)",
    "solution": "There are eight vertices of a cube, and we choose three of these to form a triangle. Thus, the number of distinct triangles that can be formed is $\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8\\cdot7\\cdot6}{3\\cdot2} = \\boxed{56}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the total number of vertices in a cube\nA cube has 8 vertices.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of vertices needed to form a triangle\nTo form a triangle, we need to connect 3 different vertices.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of distinct triangles using combinations\nThe number of distinct triangles can be calculated using the combination formula, which is given by C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 8 (total vertices) and k = 3 (vertices needed to form a triangle).\n\n## Step 4: Apply the combination formula\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 8! / (3!5!) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1) = 56.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{56}$"
