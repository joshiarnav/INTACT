    "problem": "How many different positive, four-digit integers can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9 and 9?",
    "solution": "We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting. That is, if we had 4 distinct digits, there would be $4! = 24$ orderings. However, we must divide by 2! once for the repetition of the digit 2, and divide by 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digit were different we would have twice as many orderings). So, our answer is $\\frac{4!}{2!\\cdot 2!} = 2 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{6}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and requirements\nWe need to find the number of different positive, four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9. This involves considering the permutations of these digits, taking into account the repetition of the digits 2 and 9.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate total permutations without considering repetition\nIf all digits were unique, the total number of permutations for a four-digit number would be 4!. However, since we have repetitions of the digits 2 and 9, we need to adjust for this.\n\n## Step 3: Adjust for repetition\nTo adjust for the repetition, we divide the total permutations by the factorial of the number of times each digit is repeated. In this case, we divide by 2! twice because both the digit 2 and the digit 9 are each repeated twice.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final number of permutations\nThe formula to calculate the number of permutations with repetition is: total permutations = 4! / (2! * 2!). Calculating this gives: total permutations = 24 / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$"
