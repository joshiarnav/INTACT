    "problem": "In how many different ways can four students stand in a straight line if two of the students refuse to stand next to each other?",
    "solution": "We will count the number of ways in which the two students do stand next to each other and then subtract that from the total number of ways all four students can stand in a line without the restriction. If the two students stand next to each other, then we can treat them as a block. There are three blocks: two one-student blocks and one two-student block. We can arrange the blocks in $3!=6$ ways, and there are 2 ways to arrange the students within the two-student block, for a total of $6\\cdot2=12$ ways. The total number of ways to arrange all four students in a line without restrictions is $4!=24$ ways. Thus, the number of ways with the restriction is $24-12=\\boxed{12}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways four students can stand in a line without any restrictions.\nThe total number of ways to arrange four students in a line is given by 4!, which equals 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways the two students who refuse to stand next to each other are together.\nTo do this, we can think of the two students as a single unit. This gives us three units (the pair of students plus the two individual students) to arrange. The number of ways to arrange these three units is 3!, which equals 3 x 2 x 1 = 6. However, within the pair unit, the two students can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways (either student can be to the left of the other). So, the total number of ways with the two students together is 6 x 2 = 12.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways the four students can stand in a line with the restriction in place.\nTo find the number of ways the students can stand in a line with the two students not standing next to each other, we subtract the number of ways they can stand together from the total number of ways without restrictions. So, that's 24 - 12 = 12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"
