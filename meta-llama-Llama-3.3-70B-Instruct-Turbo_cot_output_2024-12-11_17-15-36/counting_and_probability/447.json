    "problem": "There are 12 different-colored crayons in a box. How many ways can Karl select four crayons if the order in which he draws them out does not matter?",
    "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nKarl has 12 different-colored crayons and wants to select 4 of them. The order in which he selects the crayons does not matter.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the type of problem\nThis is a combination problem because the order of selection does not matter.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the combination formula\nThe formula for combinations is given by: $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $k$ is the number of items to choose, and $!$ denotes factorial.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the combination\nSubstitute $n = 12$ (total crayons) and $k = 4$ (crayons to select) into the combination formula:\n$C(12, 4) = \\frac{12!}{4!(12-4)!} = \\frac{12!}{4!8!}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the factorial expressions\nCalculate the factorials and simplify:\n$12! = 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8!$,\n$4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$,\n$8! = 8!$ (this will cancel out with the $8!$ in the denominator).\n\n## Step 6: Perform the calculation\n$\\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}{(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1) \\times 8!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}$.\n\n## Step 7: Complete the calculation\n$= \\frac{11880}{24} = 495$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{495}$"
