    "problem": "A soccer team has $22$ available players. A fixed set of $11$ players starts the game, while the other $11$ are available as substitutes. During the game, the coach may make as many as $3$ substitutions, where any one of the $11$ players in the game is replaced by one of the substitutes. No player removed from the game may reenter the game, although a substitute entering the game may be replaced later. No two substitutions can happen at the same time. The players involved and the order of the substitutions matter. Let $n$ be the number of ways the coach can make substitutions during the game (including the possibility of making no substitutions). Find the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$.\n",
    "solution": "There are $0-3$ substitutions. The number of ways to sub any number of times must be multiplied by the previous number. This is defined recursively. The case for $0$ subs is $1$, and the ways to reorganize after $n$ subs is the product of the number of new subs ($12-n$) and the players that can be ejected ($11$). The formula for $n$ subs is then $a_n=11(12-n)a_{n-1}$ with $a_0=1$.\nSumming from $0$ to $3$ gives $1+11^2+11^{3}\\cdot 10+11^{4}\\cdot 10\\cdot 9$. Notice that $10+9\\cdot11\\cdot10=10+990=1000$. Then, rearrange it into $1+11^2+11^3\\cdot (10+11\\cdot10\\cdot9)= 1+11^2+11^3\\cdot (1000)$. When taking modulo $1000$, the last term goes away. What is left is $1+11^2=\\boxed{122}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the problem\nThe coach has the option to make 0, 1, 2, or 3 substitutions from a pool of 11 substitute players to replace any of the 11 starting players. The order and the players involved in the substitutions matter.\n\n## Step 2: Calculating the number of ways for 0 substitutions\nIf the coach makes 0 substitutions, there is only 1 way to do this, which is to make no changes to the starting lineup.\n\n## Step 3: Calculating the number of ways for 1 substitution\nFor 1 substitution, the coach can choose any of the 11 starting players to substitute out and any of the 11 substitutes to bring in. This can be calculated as 11 choices for the player to substitute out * 11 choices for the substitute to bring in = 11 * 11 = 121 ways.\n\n## Step 4: Calculating the number of ways for 2 substitutions\nFor 2 substitutions, the coach has 11 choices for the first player to substitute out and 11 choices for the first substitute to bring in. Then, the coach has 10 remaining starting players (since one has been substituted out) and 10 remaining substitutes (since one has been brought in) for the second substitution. This gives 11 * 11 * 10 * 10 = 12100 ways.\n\n## Step 5: Calculating the number of ways for 3 substitutions\nFor 3 substitutions, following the same logic as before, the coach has 11 choices for the first player to substitute out and 11 choices for the first substitute to bring in. Then, 10 choices for the second player and 10 choices for the second substitute. Finally, 9 choices for the third player and 9 choices for the third substitute. This gives 11 * 11 * 10 * 10 * 9 * 9 = 108900 ways.\n\n## Step 6: Summing up all the possibilities\nTo find the total number of ways the coach can make substitutions, we add the results from steps 2 through 5: 1 (for 0 substitutions) + 121 (for 1 substitution) + 12100 (for 2 substitutions) + 108900 (for 3 substitutions) = 1 + 121 + 12100 + 108900 = 120122.\n\n## Step 7: Finding the remainder when divided by 1000\nWe need to find the remainder when 120122 is divided by 1000 to get the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{122}$"
