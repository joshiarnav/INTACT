    "problem": "Let $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ be the vertices of a regular tetrahedron each of whose edges measures 1 meter. A bug, starting from vertex $A$, observes the following rule: at each vertex it chooses one of the three edges meeting at that vertex, each edge being equally likely to be chosen, and crawls along that edge to the vertex at its opposite end. Let $p = \\frac n{729}$ be the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ when it has crawled exactly 7 meters. Find the value of $n$.\n",
    "solution": "Let $P(n)$ denote the probability that the bug is at $A$ after it has crawled $n$ meters. Since the bug can only be at vertex $A$ if it just left a vertex which is not $A$, we have $P(n + 1) = \\frac13 (1 - P(n))$. We also know $P(0) = 1$, so we can quickly compute $P(1)=0$, $P(2) = \\frac 13$, $P(3) = \\frac29$, $P(4) = \\frac7{27}$, $P(5) = \\frac{20}{81}$, $P(6) = \\frac{61}{243}$ and $P(7) = \\frac{182}{729}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{182}$. One can solve this recursion fairly easily to determine a closed-form expression for $P(n)$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem and its components\nWe have a regular tetrahedron with vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, and a bug starting from vertex $A$. The bug moves along the edges of the tetrahedron, choosing each edge with equal probability, and we want to find the probability that the bug is back at vertex $A$ after crawling exactly 7 meters.\n\n## Step 2: Establish the recursive nature of the problem\nLet's denote $P(n)$ as the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ after crawling $n$ meters. We notice that if the bug is at vertex $A$ after crawling $n$ meters, then it must have just left a vertex that is not $A$. Thus, we have a recursive relationship to consider.\n\n## Step 3: Derive the recursive formula for $P(n)$\nGiven that the bug can only be at vertex $A$ if it just left a non-$A$ vertex, and considering the tetrahedron's symmetry and the bug's random movement, the probability of being at $A$ after $n$ meters depends on not being at $A$ after $(n-1)$ meters. Since the bug chooses an edge randomly and each vertex has three edges, the probability of moving to any particular adjacent vertex is $\\frac{1}{3}$. If the bug is at $A$ after $(n-1)$ meters, it has a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance of not being at $A$ after $n$ meters (since it must move to one of the other three vertices). Conversely, if the bug is not at $A$ after $(n-1)$ meters, it has a $\\frac{1}{3}$ chance of being at $A$ after $n$ meters. Therefore, we can express the recursive relationship as $P(n) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(n-1))$.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the initial conditions and calculate $P(1)$ to $P(7)$\nWe start with $P(0) = 1$ because the bug begins at vertex $A$. Then, using the recursive formula:\n- $P(1) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(0)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - 1) = 0$,\n- $P(2) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(1)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - 0) = \\frac{1}{3}$,\n- $P(3) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(2)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - \\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{2}{9}$,\n- $P(4) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(3)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - \\frac{2}{9}) = \\frac{7}{27}$,\n- $P(5) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(4)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - \\frac{7}{27}) = \\frac{20}{81}$,\n- $P(6) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(5)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - \\frac{20}{81}) = \\frac{61}{243}$,\n- $P(7) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - P(6)) = \\frac{1}{3}(1 - \\frac{61}{243}) = \\frac{1}{3}(\\frac{182}{243}) = \\frac{182}{729}$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify $n$ for $p = \\frac{n}{729}$\nFrom step 4, we found $P(7) = \\frac{182}{729}$, which means $n = 182$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{182}$"
