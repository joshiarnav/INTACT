So there are $3^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ into disjoint $A$, $B$, and $C$.\nHowever, there are $2^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ such that $A = \\emptyset$ and $S = B+C$, and there are $2^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ such that $B = \\emptyset$ and $S = A+C$. But, the combination such that $A = B = \\emptyset$ and $S = C$ is counted twice.\nThus, there are $3^{10}-2\\cdot2^{10}+1$ ordered pairs of sets $(A,B)$. But since the question asks for the number of unordered sets $\\{ A,B \\}$, $n = \\frac{1}{2}(3^{10}-2\\cdot2^{10}+1) = 28501 \\equiv \\boxed{501} \\pmod{1000}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem\nWe need to find the number of sets of two non-empty disjoint subsets of the set $\\mathcal{S} = \\lbrace1,2,3,\\ldots,10\\rbrace$, and then find the remainder when this number is divided by $1000$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the approach\nLet's consider two non-empty disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ of $\\mathcal{S}$. For each element $i \\in \\mathcal{S}$, there are $3$ choices: $i$ could be in $A$, in $B$, or in neither $A$ nor $B$. This can be represented as a $3^{10}$ total number of ways to organize the elements of $\\mathcal{S}$ into disjoint $A$ and $B$. However, there are cases where either $A$ or $B$ (or both) are empty, which need to be subtracted from the total count.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of ways to organize elements into disjoint A and B\nThere are $3^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $\\mathcal{S}$ into disjoint $A$ and $B$, considering all possible combinations including empty sets.\n\n## Step 4: Subtract the cases where A or B is empty\nWe must subtract the cases where $A$ is empty and $B$ is empty. If $A$ is empty, then all $10$ elements of $\\mathcal{S}$ can either be in $B$ or in neither $A$ nor $B$, giving $2^{10}$ possibilities. Similarly, if $B$ is empty, there are $2^{10}$ possibilities. However, we have subtracted the case where both $A$ and $B$ are empty twice, so we must add $1$ back to account for this.\n\n## Step 5: Account for the double counting of the case where both A and B are empty\nThe correct formula to find the number of ordered pairs of sets $(A,B)$ is $3^{10} - 2 \\cdot 2^{10} + 1$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of unordered sets {A,B}\nSince the question asks for the number of unordered sets $\\{A,B\\}$, we need to divide the number of ordered pairs $(A,B)$ by $2$ to account for the fact that $(A,B)$ and $(B,A)$ represent the same unordered set.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of unordered sets {A,B} considering the division by 2\nThe number of unordered sets $\\{A,B\\}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(3^{10}-2\\cdot2^{10}+1)$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the value\n$\\frac{1}{2}(3^{10}-2\\cdot2^{10}+1) = \\frac{1}{2}(59049 - 2\\cdot1024 + 1) = \\frac{1}{2}(59049 - 2048 + 1) = \\frac{1}{2}(57002) = 28501$.\n\n## Step 9: Find the remainder when n is divided by 1000\nThe remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$ is $28501 \\mod 1000 = 501$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{501}$"
