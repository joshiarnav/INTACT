    "problem": "If Greg rolls four fair six-sided dice, what is the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's?",
    "solution": "We notice that the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's must equal the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's. So, we can find the probability that Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's, subtract it from 1, and divide by 2 to find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's. There are three ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's: he can roll two of each, one of each, or none of each. If he rolls two of each, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which two dice roll the 1's. If he rolls one of each, there are $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1}=12$ ways to choose which dice are the 6 and the 1, and for each of those ways there are $4\\cdot4=16$ ways to choose the values of the other dice. If Greg rolls no 1's or 6's, there are $4^4=256$ possible values for the dice. In total, there are $6+12\\cdot16+256=454$ ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's. There are $6^4=1296$ total ways the four dice can roll, so the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\left(1-\\dfrac{454}{1296}\\right)=\\boxed{\\dfrac{421}{1296}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of outcomes when rolling four dice\nWhen rolling four six-sided dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the total number of outcomes for four dice is $6^4 = 1296$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to roll the same number of 1's and 6's\nTo find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's, it's helpful to first calculate the probability of rolling the same number of 1's and 6's, and then use the complement rule. The cases where he rolls the same number of 1's and 6's are: rolling two of each, rolling one of each, and rolling none of each.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to roll two 1's and two 6's\nThe number of ways to choose which two of the four dice show 1's (and thus the other two show 6's) is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$. For each of these combinations, the other two dice can be any of the four remaining numbers (2, 3, 4, 5), but since we are specifically looking at the scenario of two 1's and two 6's, these other dice are not relevant to this specific calculation. So, there are 6 ways to roll two 1's and two 6's.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to roll one 1 and one 6\nThe number of ways to choose which one of the four dice shows a 1 is $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$, and then there are $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways to choose which of the remaining dice shows a 6. The remaining two dice can each be any of the four numbers 2, 3, 4, or 5, so there are $4^2 = 16$ possibilities for these two dice. Thus, the total number of ways to roll one 1 and one 6 is $4 \\times 3 \\times 16 = 192$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to roll no 1's or 6's\nFor each die, there are 4 possibilities (2, 3, 4, 5) that are neither 1 nor 6. Since there are four dice, the total number of ways to roll no 1's or 6's is $4^4 = 256$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of ways to roll the same number of 1's and 6's\nAdding the results from steps 3, 4, and 5 gives us the total number of ways to roll the same number of 1's and 6's: $6 + 192 + 256 = 454$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's using the complement rule\nThe probability of rolling more 1's than 6's can be found by subtracting the probability of rolling the same number of 1's and 6's and the probability of rolling more 6's than 1's from 1. However, since the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's is equal to the probability of rolling more 6's than 1's due to symmetry, we can find the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's by calculating half of the probability of not rolling the same number of 1's and 6's.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the probability of not rolling the same number of 1's and 6's\nThe probability of not rolling the same number of 1's and 6's is $1 - \\frac{454}{1296}$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's\nSince the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's is half of the probability of not rolling the same number of 1's and 6's (due to symmetry with rolling more 6's than 1's), we have: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (1 - \\frac{454}{1296}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1296 - 454}{1296} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{842}{1296} = \\frac{421}{1296}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{421}{1296}}$"
