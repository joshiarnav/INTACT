    "problem": "If I have a $4\\times 4$ chess board, in how many ways can I place four distinct pawns on the board such that each column and row of the board contains no more than one pawn?",
    "solution": "Because our chess board is $4 \\times 4$, there must be exactly one pawn in each column and each row. Consider the ways to place one pawn in each row. In the first row, there are four potential spots for a pawn. However, no matter where we place the pawn, it takes up one column. So, in the second row, there are only three potential spots for a pawn. Similarly, there are two spots in the third row and only one in the fourth. Thus, there are $4\\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 24$ ways in which we can place the pawns. Now, because each pawn is distinct, we have four possible pawns to place in the first slot, three in the second, two in the fourth, and one in the last. So there are $24$ possible orderings of the pawns. Our final answer is thus $24^2 = \\boxed{576}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and constraints\nWe are given a $4\\times 4$ chess board and need to find the number of ways to place four distinct pawns on the board such that each column and row contains no more than one pawn. This means each pawn must be in a unique row and column.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of ways to place the first pawn\nFor the first pawn, we have $4 \\times 4 = 16$ possible positions to place it since the board is $4\\times 4$ and we can choose any empty square.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to place the second pawn\nAfter placing the first pawn, for the second pawn, we have $3 \\times 3 = 9$ possible positions. This is because one row and one column are already occupied by the first pawn, leaving 3 rows and 3 columns where we can place the second pawn.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the number of ways to place the third pawn\nWith the first two pawns placed, for the third pawn, we have $2 \\times 2 = 4$ possible positions. Two rows and two columns are now occupied, leaving 2 rows and 2 columns available for the third pawn.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to place the fourth pawn\nAfter placing the first three pawns, there is only $1 \\times 1 = 1$ possible position left for the fourth pawn, as three rows and three columns are occupied by the first three pawns.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the multiplication principle to find the total number of ways\nTo find the total number of ways to place the four distinct pawns on the board under the given conditions, we multiply the number of ways to place each pawn: $16 \\times 9 \\times 4 \\times 1 = 576$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{576}$"
