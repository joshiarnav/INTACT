    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nGeorge needs to choose 2 colors out of 7 to paint his room. This is a combination problem, because the order in which he chooses the colors does not matter.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the formula for combinations\nThe formula for combinations is given by C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the formula to the problem\nHere, n = 7 (total number of colors) and k = 2 (number of colors to choose). So, we need to calculate C(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!) = 7! / (2!5!).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the factorials\n7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040,\n2! = 2 * 1 = 2,\n5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n\n## Step 5: Plug the factorials into the formula\nC(7, 2) = 5040 / (2 * 120) = 5040 / 240.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final value\nC(7, 2) = 5040 / 240 = 21.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$"
