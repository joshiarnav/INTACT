    "problem": "If I roll 5 standard 6-sided dice and multiply the number on the face of each die, what is the probability that the result is a composite number?",
    "solution": "While it is almost tempting to make this into the casework problem to end all casework problems, using complementary probability makes the problem a lot simpler, so we will find the probability that the product is not composite.\n\nIt's clear that if more than one die shows a roll greater than 1, the resulting product will have more than one factor that is greater than 1 and therefore be composite. Additionally, if any of the dice show a 4 or a 6, the product will obviously be composite. So in order for the product to not be composite, we need at least four dice to be a 1 and the fifth die to either be another 1 or a 2, a 3, or a 5.\n\nThere's exactly one way in which all the the dice can be 1's, and for each of the other three cases there are 5 ways since the die that isn't a 1 can appear in any of the 5 other positions, so there are a total of $3\\cdot5+1=16$ ways of rolling the dice that result in a product that isn't composite. Additionally, there are 6 options for the roll of each of the 5 dice for a total of $6^5=7776$ possible outcomes, which means that the probability of the product not being composite is $\\dfrac{16}{7776}$ and the probability that it is composite is $1-\\frac{16}{7776}=\\frac{7760}{7776}=\\boxed{\\frac{485}{486}}$.\n\nNote: Many students have tried to argue that 1 is not a prime number and should not be counted. As we are doing complementary probability, it is important to consider all numbers that are not composite, and 1 is definitely not composite.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the total number of outcomes when rolling 5 dice\nWhen rolling 5 standard 6-sided dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the total number of outcomes for 5 dice is $6^5 = 7776$.\n\n## Step 2: Understand what a composite number is\nA composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. Conversely, a number is considered to be composite if it is not prime. For the product of the dice to be composite, at least one of the following conditions must be met: (a) at least two dice show a roll greater than 1, or (b) any die shows a 4 or a 6, since these are composite numbers themselves.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to get a non-composite product\nTo find the probability that the product is composite, it's easier to first calculate the probability that the product is not composite and then subtract that from 1. A product will not be composite if at least four dice show a 1 and the fifth die shows either a 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n## Step 4: Count the outcomes resulting in a non-composite product\n- All dice show 1: There's exactly 1 way this can happen.\n- Four dice show 1 and the remaining die shows 2, 3, or 5: There are 3 possibilities for the non-1 die (2, 3, or 5) and 5 ways to choose which die is not 1. So, there are $3 \\times 5 = 15$ ways this can happen.\nThus, the total number of outcomes resulting in a non-composite product is $1 + 15 = 16$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of getting a composite product\nThe probability of the product being composite is 1 minus the probability of the product not being composite. The probability of the product not being composite is the number of outcomes resulting in a non-composite product divided by the total number of outcomes. So, the probability of a non-composite product is $16 / 7776$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the probability of getting a composite product\nThe probability of getting a composite product is $1 - (16 / 7776)$. Simplifying, $1 - (16 / 7776) = (7776 - 16) / 7776 = 7760 / 7776$. This fraction can be simplified further.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction\nTo simplify $7760 / 7776$, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7760 and 7776. The GCD of 7760 and 7776 is 16. Dividing both numerator and denominator by 16 gives $(7760 / 16) / (7776 / 16) = 485 / 486$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{485}{486}}$"
