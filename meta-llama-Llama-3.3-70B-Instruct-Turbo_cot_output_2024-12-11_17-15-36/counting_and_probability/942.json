    "solution": "We can see that the maximum positive difference is $16 - 1 = 15.$ Some quick calculations show that we can get all values between $1$ and $15.$ \\begin{align*}\n16 - 1 &= 15 \\\\\n16 - 2 &= 14 \\\\\n16 - 3 &= 13 \\\\\n& \\ \\,\\vdots \\\\\n16-14&=2\\\\\n16-15&=1\n\\end{align*} Therefore there are $\\boxed{15}$ different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 14, 15, 16 \\}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the set given\nThe set provided is a sequence of consecutive integers from 1 to 16.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the differences range\nTo find the range of possible differences, we should consider the smallest and largest differences that can be achieved by subtracting two distinct members of the set.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the smallest possible difference\nThe smallest difference will always be 1, achieved by subtracting consecutive numbers (e.g., 2 - 1 = 1).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the largest possible difference\nThe largest difference will be achieved by subtracting the smallest number from the largest number in the set (16 - 1 = 15).\n\n## Step 5: Consider all possible differences\nAny integer from 1 to 15 can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set. For example, to achieve a difference of 2, we can do 3 - 1 = 2, for 3, we can do 4 - 1 = 3, and so on up to 15 - 1 = 14 for a difference of 14, and 16 - 1 = 15 for a difference of 15.\n\n## Step 6: Count the distinct differences\nSince we can achieve differences from 1 to 15, we count how many distinct positive integers are in this range.\n\n## Step 7: Conclusion\nThe range from 1 to 15 includes 15 distinct positive integers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$"
