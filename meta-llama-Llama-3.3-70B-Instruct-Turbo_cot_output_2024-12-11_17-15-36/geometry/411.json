    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and visualize the given figure\nThe problem provides a right triangle $AGD$ with a square $BCFE$ inscribed in it. The lengths of $AB$ and $CD$ are given as 28 units and 58 units, respectively. We need to find the area of the square $BCFE$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the relationship between the sides of the triangle and the square\nLet's denote the side length of the square as $x$. Since the square is inscribed in the triangle, $\\angle CDF = \\angle AEB$ and $\\angle BAE = \\angle CFD$. This implies that $\\triangle AEB \\sim \\triangle FDC$ due to Angle-Angle Similarity.\n\n## Step 3: Establish the proportion using similar triangles\nUsing the similarity of the triangles, we can set up the following proportion: $\\frac{AB}{x} = \\frac{x}{CD}$. Substituting the given values, we get $\\frac{28}{x} = \\frac{x}{58}$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for the side length of the square\nCross-multiplying the proportion, we obtain $28 \\cdot 58 = x^2$, which simplifies to $1624 = x^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the area of the square\nTo find the area of the square, we take the square root of $x^2$, which gives us $x = \\sqrt{1624}$. The area of the square is then $x^2 = 1624$ square units.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1624}$"
