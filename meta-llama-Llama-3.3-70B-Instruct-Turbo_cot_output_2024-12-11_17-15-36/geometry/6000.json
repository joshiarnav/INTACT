Now, we have a regular tetrahedron $EFGH$, which by symmetry has twice the volume of our original solid. This tetrahedron has side length $2s = 12\\sqrt{2}$. Using the formula for the volume of a regular tetrahedron, which is $V = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}S^3}{12}$, where S is the side length of the tetrahedron, the volume of our original solid is:\n$V = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot (12\\sqrt{2})^3}{12} = \\boxed{288}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the volume of the solid, we first need to understand its geometric configuration.\nThe solid shown has a square base with side length $s$, and the upper edge is parallel to the base with length $2s$. All other edges have length $s$.\n\n## Step 2: The given solid can be divided into two right triangular prisms.\nBy drawing a line from the top edge to the base, we can see that the solid can be divided into two right triangular prisms. This is because the line will act as the height for both prisms.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the dimensions of the right triangular prisms.\nGiven that $s=6\\sqrt{2}$, we know the base of each prism is a right triangle with legs of length $s$ and $s/2$ (half of the base of the solid), and the height of each prism is $s$ (since the upper edge is parallel to the base).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the base of one of the triangular prisms.\nThe area of the base of one triangular prism is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot s \\cdot \\frac{s}{2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the area of the base of one of the triangular prisms using the given value of $s$.\nSubstitute $s=6\\sqrt{2}$ into the area formula: $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\frac{6\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression for the area of the base of one triangular prism.\nArea $= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\frac{6\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 3\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 18 \\cdot 2 = 18$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the volume of one triangular prism.\nThe volume of one prism is the area of its base times its height: $18 \\cdot 6\\sqrt{2}$ is incorrect since the height should be the perpendicular distance from the base to the top, not $6\\sqrt{2}$. We need to find the actual height of the prism.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the height of the prism.\nTo find the height, consider the right triangle formed by the height, half the length of the upper edge ($s$), and the slant edge ($s$). This forms an isosceles right triangle since the slant edge and half the upper edge are both $s$ and the height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem or recognizing the $45-45-90$ triangle relationship.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the height of the prism using the Pythagorean theorem.\nHowever, recognizing the triangle's properties provides a simpler method: the height $h = s / \\sqrt{2}$ because in a $45-45-90$ triangle, the sides are in a $1 : 1 : \\sqrt{2}$ ratio.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the numerical value of the height using $s=6\\sqrt{2}$.\nSubstitute $s=6\\sqrt{2}$ into the formula for height: $h = \\frac{6\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = 6$.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the volume of one triangular prism using the correct height.\nThe volume of one prism is $18 \\cdot 6 = 108$.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the total volume of the solid.\nSince the solid can be divided into two such prisms, the total volume is $2 \\cdot 108 = 216$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{216}$"
