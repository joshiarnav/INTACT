    "problem": "Let $ABCD$ and $BCFG$ be two faces of a cube with $AB=12$. A beam of light emanates from vertex $A$ and reflects off face $BCFG$ at point $P$, which is 7 units from $\\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\\overline{BC}$. The beam continues to be reflected off the faces of the cube. The length of the light path from the time it leaves point $A$ until it next reaches a vertex of the cube is given by $m\\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n$.\n",
    "solution": "When a light beam reflects off a surface, the path is like that of a ball bouncing. Picture that, and also imagine X, Y, and Z coordinates for the cube vertices. The coordinates will all involve 0's and 12's only, so that means that the X, Y, and Z distance traveled by the light must all be divisible by 12. Since the light's Y changes by 5 and the X changes by 7 (the Z changes by 12, don't worry about that), and 5 and 7 are relatively prime to 12, the light must make 12 reflections onto the XY plane or the face parallel to the XY plane.\nIn each reflection, the distance traveled by the light is $\\sqrt{ (12^2) + (5^2) + (7^2) }$ = $\\sqrt{218}$. This happens 12 times, so the total distance is $12\\sqrt{218}$. $m=12$ and $n=218$, so therefore, the answer is $m+n=\\boxed{230}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Visualizing the Problem\nTo solve this problem, we first visualize the cube and the path of the light beam. Since the coordinates of the cube's vertices only involve 0's and 12's, the X, Y, and Z distances traveled by the light must all be divisible by 12. Given that the change in Y is 5 units and the change in X is 7 units, and that 5 and 7 are relatively prime to 12, the light must make 12 reflections onto the XY plane or the face parallel to the XY plane.\n\n## Step 2: Calculating the Distance Traveled\nFor each reflection, the distance traveled by the light can be calculated using the formula for the distance between two points in 3D space, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{ (12^2) + (5^2) + (7^2) } = \\sqrt{ 218 }$ due to the properties of the cube and the reflection points.\n\n## Step 3: Total Distance Calculation\nSince the light makes 12 reflections, the total distance traveled by the light from the time it leaves point A until it next reaches a vertex of the cube is $12\\sqrt{218}$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplifying the Answer\nWe need to simplify $\\sqrt{218}$ to ensure that the final answer is in the required format. $\\sqrt{218}$ can be simplified as $\\sqrt{2 \\cdot 109}$, which cannot be simplified further because 109 is a prime number.\n\n## Step 5: Final Calculation\nThe length of the light path is given by $12\\sqrt{218}$, which means $m = 12$ and $n = 218$. The sum of $m$ and $n$ is $12 + 218 = 230$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{230}$"
