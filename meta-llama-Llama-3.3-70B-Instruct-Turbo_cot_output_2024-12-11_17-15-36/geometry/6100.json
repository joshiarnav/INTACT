    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the given figure\nThe problem presents a packing of eight circles of diameter 1 in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane. The task is to find the equation of a line with a slope of 3 that divides the union of these circular regions into two equal areas.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the line that divides the region into two equal areas\nTo divide the region into two equal areas, the line must pass through the tangency point of the bottom left circle and the one to its right. Similarly, it must also pass through the tangency point of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it. This ensures that the line cuts congruent areas, allowing for the division of the region into two equal parts.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the coordinates of the tangency points\nThe tangency point of the bottom left circle and the one to its right is $\\left(1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, and the tangency point of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it is $\\left(\\frac{3}{2},2\\right)$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the coordinates to find the equation of the line\nUsing the coordinates of the tangency points, we can find the equation of the line with a slope of 3 that passes through these points.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the equation of the line\nThe line with a slope of 3 passing through $\\left(1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ is given by $y - \\frac{1}{2} = 3(x-1)$, which simplifies to $y = 3x - \\frac{5}{2}$. Rearranging this equation into the form $ax = by + c$, we get $3x = y + \\frac{5}{2}$, and then $6x = 2y + 5$.\n\n## Step 6: Express the equation in the required form\nThe equation $6x = 2y + 5$ is already in the form $ax = by + c$, where $a = 6$, $b = 2$, and $c = 5$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the sum of the squares of the coefficients\nTo find $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$, we simply calculate $6^2 + 2^2 + 5^2 = 36 + 4 + 25 = 65$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{65}$"
