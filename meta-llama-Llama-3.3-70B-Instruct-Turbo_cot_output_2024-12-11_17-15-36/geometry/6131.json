    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nThe problem describes a square $ABCD$ with points $E$ and $F$ on sides $AD$ and $BC$ respectively, such that $BE = EF = FD = 30$. The task is to find the area of the square $ABCD$.\n\n## Step 2: Visualize the problem\nTo approach this problem, it's helpful to visualize or sketch the situation. Given the equal lengths of $BE$, $EF$, and $FD$, we can imagine the square and these line segments to understand the geometry involved.\n\n## Step 3: Identify key geometric properties\nThe segments $BE$, $EF$, and $FD$ divide the square into three equal horizontal sections. Let's denote the side length of the square $ABCD$ as $x$. Since $BE = EF = FD = 30$, and these segments form the diagonals of smaller rectangles within the square, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the side length of the square to the length of these segments.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean theorem\nConsider the right triangle formed by $BE$ (or $FD$) and the sides of the square. Let $y$ be the length of the side of the square that is part of the smaller rectangle formed by $BE$ (or $FD$). Then, $y^2 + (x/3)^2 = 30^2$ because $BE$ (or $FD$) acts as the hypotenuse of this right triangle, and $x/3$ is the height of this smaller rectangle since $BE$, $EF$, and $FD$ divide the square into three equal parts vertically.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for x\nHowever, realizing that the segments divide the square into three equal parts both horizontally and vertically, and considering the right triangle that includes half of the square's side and one of the segments, we can directly apply the Pythagorean theorem to find $x$. The correct approach involves recognizing the segments create three equal parts, thus each part's length is $x/3$. But to directly solve for $x$ using the given information, we should consider the relationship of the segments to the square's sides and apply geometric principles correctly.\n\n## Step 6: Correct application of geometric principles\nGiven that $BE = EF = FD = 30$, and these are diagonals of rectangles formed within the square, we can see that each of these segments, along with the sides of the square, forms a right-angled triangle. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b), so $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$. For our case, considering the triangle formed by half the square (since $BE$ and $FD$ are equal and divide the square into thirds vertically), we have $30^2 = (x/3)^2 + x^2$ because $x/3$ is the length of one side (the height of the smaller rectangle) and $x$ is the length of the other side (half the square's diagonal or the base of the smaller rectangle).\n\n## Step 7: Solve the equation for x\nLet's solve $30^2 = (x/3)^2 + x^2$. This equation simplifies to $900 = x^2/9 + x^2$. Multiplying every term by 9 to get rid of the fraction, we get $8100 = x^2 + 9x^2$, which simplifies to $8100 = 10x^2$. Solving for $x^2$, we get $x^2 = 8100 / 10 = 810$.\n\n## Step 8: Find the area of the square\nThe area of a square is given by the formula $Area = side^2$. Since we've found $x^2 = 810$, this directly gives us the area of the square.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{810}$"
