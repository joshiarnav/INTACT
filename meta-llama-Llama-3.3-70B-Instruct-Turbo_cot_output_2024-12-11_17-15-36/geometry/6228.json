Draw $X$, where $X$ is on $BC$ and $AC \\parallel PX$. By AA Similarity, $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle PBX$, so $PX = 3an$, $BX = 4an$, and $CX = 4an - 4n$.\nAlso, let $\\angle ABC = a$ and $\\angle BAC = b$. Since the angles of a triangle add up to $180^{\\circ}$, $\\angle BCA = 180-a-b$. By Exterior Angle Theorem, $\\angle ACX = a+b$, and since $CP$ bisects $\\angle ACX$, $\\angle PCX = \\frac{a+b}{2}$. Because $AC \\parallel PX$, $\\angle BXP = 180 - a - b$. Thus, $\\angle CPX = \\frac{a+b}{2}$, making $\\triangle CPX$ an isosceles triangle.\nBecause $\\triangle CPX$ is isosceles, $PX = CX$, so $4an - 4n = 3an$. That means $a = 4$, so $PB = 4 \\cdot AB$. Thus, $PA = PB - AB = 3 \\cdot AB$, so $PA : AB = \\boxed{3:1}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the given triangle and its properties\nWe are given a triangle $\\triangle ABC$ where the ratio of $AC$ to $CB$ is $3:4$. This implies that the side lengths are in a ratio, but the actual lengths are not provided.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the Angle Bisector Theorem\nThe Angle Bisector Theorem states that in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle. However, in this case, we're dealing with the bisector of an exterior angle, which requires a different approach.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Exterior Angle Bisector Theorem\nFor an exterior angle bisector of a triangle, the theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments of the side opposite the exterior angle (formed by extending one of the sides) is equal to the ratio of the other two sides of the triangle. In this scenario, the bisector of the exterior angle at $C$ intersects $BA$ extended at $P$. Thus, we need to consider how $PA$ and $AB$ relate to $AC$ and $CB$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the ratio $PA:AB$\nGiven $AC:CB = 3:4$, and using the property that the exterior angle bisector theorem creates a ratio between the segments formed by intersecting an extended side and the ratio of the other two sides, we find that $PA:AB$ corresponds to the inverse ratio of the sides $AC$ and $CB$ because $P$ lies on the extension of $BA$. The exterior angle bisector theorem implies that $PA:AB = CB:AC$ when considering the exterior angle at $C$. Therefore, $PA:AB = 4:3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3:1}$"
