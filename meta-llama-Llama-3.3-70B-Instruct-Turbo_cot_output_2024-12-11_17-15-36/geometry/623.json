    "solution": "Let the coordinates of $A$ be $(a_1,a_2)$. Then since $A$ is on the graph of $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, we know that $a_2 = -\\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$. We can also use our knowledge of special right triangles to write $a_2$ in terms of $a_1$. Let $C$ be the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ and let $O$ be the origin. Then $OCA$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, so the ratio of the length of $OC$ to the length of $CA$ is $\\sqrt{3}:1$. Now the coordinates of C are $(0, a_2)$, so the length of $OC$ is just $-a_2$ (since $a_2$ is negative) and the length of $CA$ is $a_1$. This means $\\dfrac{-a_2}{a_1}=\\sqrt{3} \\Longrightarrow a_2=-\\sqrt{3}a_1$.\n\nWe can now set our two equations for $a_2$ equal to each other and get $-\\sqrt{3}a_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$. Multiplying both sides by $-\\frac{2}{a_1}$ immediately gives $a_1=2\\sqrt{3}$. From here we could solve for $a_2$ using one of our equations and then use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the side length of the equilateral triangle, but there's a better way. We remember that the hypotenuse of our special triangle is twice as long as the shortest side of it, which has length $a_1=2\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore our answer is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To solve this problem, we need to first understand the properties of an equilateral triangle and how it relates to the given graph of $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$.\nAn equilateral triangle has all sides of equal length and all angles are $60^\\circ$. Given that triangle $ABO$ is equilateral, we know that $AO = BO = AB$.\n\n## Step 2: Let's consider the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ on the graph of $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$.\nAssume the coordinates of point $A$ are $(a, -\\frac{1}{2}a^2)$ and the coordinates of point $B$ are $(-a, -\\frac{1}{2}a^2)$, as they are symmetric about the y-axis due to the nature of the graph.\n\n## Step 3: The distance between points $A$ and $O$ can be found using the distance formula $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.\nThe distance $AO = \\sqrt{(a - 0)^2 + (-\\frac{1}{2}a^2 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 + \\frac{1}{4}a^4}$.\n\n## Step 4: Similarly, the distance between points $B$ and $O$ can be found using the same distance formula.\nThe distance $BO = \\sqrt{(-a - 0)^2 + (-\\frac{1}{2}a^2 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 + \\frac{1}{4}a^4}$.\n\n## Step 5: Since triangle $ABO$ is equilateral, $AO = BO = AB$. We can use this information to find the length of one side of the triangle.\nThe distance $AB = \\sqrt{(a - (-a))^2 + (-\\frac{1}{2}a^2 - (-\\frac{1}{2}a^2))^2} = \\sqrt{(2a)^2 + 0} = 2a$.\n\n## Step 6: Equating $AO$ (or $BO$) to $AB$, we can solve for $a$.\n$\\sqrt{a^2 + \\frac{1}{4}a^4} = 2a$.\nSquaring both sides gives $a^2 + \\frac{1}{4}a^4 = 4a^2$.\nRearranging the equation results in $\\frac{1}{4}a^4 - 3a^2 = 0$.\nFactoring out $a^2$ gives $a^2(\\frac{1}{4}a^2 - 3) = 0$.\nTherefore, $a^2 = 0$ or $\\frac{1}{4}a^2 - 3 = 0$.\nSince $a$ cannot be $0$ (as it would result in points $A$ and $B$ coinciding with point $O$), we solve $\\frac{1}{4}a^2 - 3 = 0$ for $a^2$.\nThis gives $\\frac{1}{4}a^2 = 3$, and thus $a^2 = 12$.\nHence, $a = \\pm \\sqrt{12} = \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n## Step 7: Now, we can find the length of one side of triangle $ABO$ using the value of $a$.\nSince $AB = 2a$, we substitute $a = 2\\sqrt{3}$ to get $AB = 2 \\times 2\\sqrt{3} = 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$"
