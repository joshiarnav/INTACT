    "problem": "Two points $A(x_1, y_1)$ and $B(x_2, y_2)$ are chosen on the graph of $f(x) = \\ln x$, with $0 < x_1 < x_2$. The points $C$ and $D$ trisect $\\overline{AB}$, with $AC < CB$. Through $C$ a horizontal line is drawn to cut the curve at $E(x_3, y_3)$. Find $x_3$ if $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 1000$.\n",
    "solution": "Since $C$ is the trisector of line segment $\\overline{AB}$ closer to $A$, the $y$-coordinate of $C$ is equal to two thirds the $y$-coordinate of $A$ plus one third the $y$-coordinate of $B$. Thus, point $C$ has coordinates $(x_0, \\frac{2}{3} \\ln 1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\ln 1000) = (x_0, \\ln 10)$ for some $x_0$. Then the horizontal line through $C$ has equation $y = \\ln 10$, and this intersects the curve $y = \\ln x$ at the point $(10, \\ln 10)$, so $x_3 = \\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Find the coordinates of points A and B\nGiven that $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 1000$, we can find the corresponding $y$-coordinates using the function $f(x) = \\ln x$. So, $y_1 = \\ln(1) = 0$ and $y_2 = \\ln(1000)$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the value of $y_2$\n$y_2 = \\ln(1000) = \\ln(10^3) = 3\\ln(10)$, because of the logarithmic property $\\ln(a^b) = b\\ln(a)$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the coordinates of point C\nSince $C$ trisects $\\overline{AB}$ and $AC < CB$, point $C$ is located at $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the distance from $A$ to $B$. The $y$-coordinate of $C$ can be found by $y_C = y_1 + \\frac{1}{3}(y_2 - y_1) = 0 + \\frac{1}{3}(3\\ln(10) - 0) = \\ln(10)$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the value of $x_3$\nThe horizontal line through $C$ will have the equation $y = \\ln(10)$. Since this line intersects the curve $f(x) = \\ln x$ at point $E(x_3, y_3)$, we set $\\ln(x_3) = \\ln(10)$ to find $x_3$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $x_3$\nFrom $\\ln(x_3) = \\ln(10)$, it follows that $x_3 = 10$, because the natural logarithm function is one-to-one, meaning that if $\\ln(a) = \\ln(b)$, then $a = b$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
