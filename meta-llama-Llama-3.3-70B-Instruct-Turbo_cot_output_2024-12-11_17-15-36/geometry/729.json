    "problem": "Amy and Belinda each roll a sheet of 6-inch by 8-inch paper to form a cylindrical tube. Amy tapes the two 8-inch sides together without overlap. Belinda tapes the two 6-inch sides together without overlap. What is $\\pi$ times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes?",
    "solution": "Amy's cylinder has a height of 8 and a base circumference of 6.  Let her cylinder have volume $V_A$ and radius $r_A$; we have $2\\pi r_A = 6$ so $r_A = 3/\\pi$ and $V_A = \\pi r_A ^2 h = \\pi (3/\\pi)^2 (8) = 72/\\pi$.\n\nBelinda's cylinder has a height of 6 and a base circumference of 8.  Similarly, let her cylinder have volume $V_B$ and radius $r_B$; we have $2\\pi r_B = 8$ so $r_B = 4/\\pi$ and $V_B = \\pi r_B^2 h = \\pi (4/\\pi)^2 (6) = 96/\\pi$.\n\nThe positive difference between the volume of the two tubes is $96/\\pi - 72/\\pi = 24/\\pi$ cubic inches; $\\pi$ times this difference is $\\boxed{24}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Find the radius of the cylinder when 8-inch sides are taped together\nWhen the 8-inch sides are taped together, the circumference of the base of the cylinder is 8 inches. The formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = 2\\pi r$, where $C$ is the circumference and $r$ is the radius. Setting $C = 8$, we can solve for $r$: $8 = 2\\pi r \\implies r = \\frac{8}{2\\pi} = \\frac{4}{\\pi}$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the volume of the cylinder when 8-inch sides are taped together\nThe height of the cylinder is 6 inches (the other dimension of the paper), and the radius was found to be $\\frac{4}{\\pi}$. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $V$ is the volume, $r$ is the radius, and $h$ is the height. Substituting the values, we get $V_1 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^2 6 = \\pi \\frac{16}{\\pi^2} 6 = \\frac{96}{\\pi}$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the radius of the cylinder when 6-inch sides are taped together\nWhen the 6-inch sides are taped together, the circumference of the base of the cylinder is 6 inches. Using the circumference formula $C = 2\\pi r$ and setting $C = 6$, we can solve for $r$: $6 = 2\\pi r \\implies r = \\frac{6}{2\\pi} = \\frac{3}{\\pi}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the volume of the cylinder when 6-inch sides are taped together\nThe height of this cylinder is 8 inches (the other dimension of the paper), and the radius was found to be $\\frac{3}{\\pi}$. Using the volume formula $V = \\pi r^2 h$, we substitute the values to get $V_2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{3}{\\pi}\\right)^2 8 = \\pi \\frac{9}{\\pi^2} 8 = \\frac{72}{\\pi}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes\nThe positive difference between $V_1$ and $V_2$ is $|V_1 - V_2| = \\left|\\frac{96}{\\pi} - \\frac{72}{\\pi}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{24}{\\pi}\\right| = \\frac{24}{\\pi}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate $\\pi$ times the positive difference of the volumes\nFinally, we multiply the positive difference by $\\pi$: $\\pi \\times \\frac{24}{\\pi} = 24$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$"
