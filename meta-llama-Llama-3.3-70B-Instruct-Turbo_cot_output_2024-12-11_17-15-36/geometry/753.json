    "problem": "How many different triangles can be formed having a perimeter of 7 units if each side must have integral length?",
    "solution": "Let $a,b,$ and $c$ represent the three side lengths of the triangle. The perimeter is $a+b+c=7,$ so $b+c=7-a$. We know by the Triangle Inequality that the sum of two side lengths of a triangle must be greater than the third side length. If we focus on the variable $a$, we have\n\\[b+c>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 7-a>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 3.5>a.\\]We could easily replace $a$ with $b$ or $c$, so the maximum length of any of the three sides is $3$. If $a=3$, then $b+c=4$ and $b$ and $c$ could be $1$ and $3$ in some order or $2$ and $2$ in some order. If we let $a=2$ or $a=1$ and the maximum side length is $3$, we'll still end up with triangles of side lengths $(1,3,3)$ or $(2,2,3)$. There are $\\boxed{2}$ different triangles.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the problem and constraints\nWe need to find the number of different triangles that can be formed with a perimeter of 7 units. Each side of the triangle must have an integral length.\n\n## Step 2: Establish the triangle inequality rule\nFor a triangle to be valid, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. This is known as the triangle inequality.\n\n## Step 3: List all possible combinations of integral side lengths that sum to 7\nGiven that each side must be an integer, we list combinations that satisfy the perimeter condition: (1, 1, 5), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 3), and (2, 2, 3).\n\n## Step 4: Apply the triangle inequality to eliminate invalid combinations\n- For (1, 1, 5), the sum of the two shorter sides (1+1=2) is not greater than the longest side (5), so this combination is invalid.\n- For (1, 2, 4), the sum of the two shorter sides (1+2=3) is not greater than the longest side (4), so this combination is invalid.\n- For (1, 3, 3), the sum of any two sides is greater than the remaining side, so this combination is valid.\n- For (2, 2, 3), the sum of any two sides is greater than the remaining side, so this combination is valid.\n\n## Step 5: Count the valid combinations\nWe found 2 valid combinations: (1, 3, 3) and (2, 2, 3).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
