    "solution": "Let $BC = s$. We can see that $AD$ consists of the altitudes from $A$ and $D$ to $BC$, each of which has length $s\\sqrt{3}/2$. Thus, $AD = s\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, $AD\\div BC = s\\sqrt{3}/s = \\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Let's denote the length of the side of the equilateral triangle as $s$.\nIn an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal. Therefore, $AB = BC = CA = s$ and $BC = CD = DB = s$.\n\n## Step 2: We need to find the length of $AD$.\nTo find $AD$, we can use the fact that $AD$ consists of the altitudes from $A$ and $D$ to $BC$. In an equilateral triangle, the altitude is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ times the length of the side. Therefore, the length of $AD$ is $s\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + s\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = s\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n## Step 3: Now, we can find $AD \\div BC$.\n$AD \\div BC$ is equal to $\\frac{AD}{BC} = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{s} = \\sqrt{3}$.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}$"
