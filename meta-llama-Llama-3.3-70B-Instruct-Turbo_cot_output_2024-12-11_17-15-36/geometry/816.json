    "problem": "A square sheet of paper has area $6 \\text{ cm}^2$. The front is white and the back is black. When the sheet is folded so that point $A$ rests on the diagonal as shown, the visible black area is equal to the visible white area. How many centimeters is $A$ from its original position? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the length of a leg of the black isosceles triangle.  Then the black area is $\\frac{1}{2}(x)(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x^2$.  The white area is $6-x^2$.  Solving $\\frac{1}{2}x^2=6-x^2$, we find $x^2=4$, so $x=2$.  The distance from A to its original position is the length of a hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs have length $x$.  Therefore, A is $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$ centimeters from its original position.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a square sheet of paper with an area of $6 \\text{ cm}^2$, where the front side is white and the back side is black. When the sheet is folded so that point $A$ rests on the diagonal, the visible black area is equal to the visible white area. We need to find the distance of point $A$ from its original position after folding.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the area of the square\nThe area of the square is given as $6 \\text{ cm}^2$. Since the area of a square is calculated as the side length squared, we can find the side length of the square. Let's denote the side length as $s$. Then, $s^2 = 6$, which means $s = \\sqrt{6}$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the folded structure\nWhen the sheet is folded, the visible black area is equal to the visible white area. Let's denote the length of a leg of the black isosceles triangle formed after folding as $x$. The area of the black triangle is then given by $\\frac{1}{2}(x)(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, and the area of the white portion is $6-x^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Set up the equation for black and white areas\nWe are given that the black area is equal to the white area, so we can set up the equation: $\\frac{1}{2}x^2=6-x^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the equation for $x$\nSolving the equation $\\frac{1}{2}x^2=6-x^2$, we get: $\\frac{3}{2}x^2=6$, which simplifies to $x^2=4$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find $x=2$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the distance from $A$ to its original position\nThe distance from $A$ to its original position can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, as it forms a right-angled triangle. Let's denote this distance as $d$. Then, $d = \\sqrt{x^2 + x^2} = \\sqrt{2x^2}$.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute $x$ into the distance formula\nSubstituting $x = 2$ into the distance formula, we get: $d = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 2^2} = \\sqrt{8}$. Simplifying, $d = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 2} = \\sqrt{4} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$"
