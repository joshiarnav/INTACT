    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the greatest and least possible integral values of $x$, we should start by applying the triangle inequality to the given triangle.\nThe triangle inequality states that in a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. This means that for our triangle with sides $x$, 5, and 6, we have the following inequalities: $x + 5 > 6$, $x + 6 > 5$, and $5 + 6 > x$. These simplify to $x > 1$, $x > -1$, and $x < 11$.\n\n## Step 2: We need to determine the range of possible integral values for $x$ based on these inequalities.\nFrom $x > 1$ and $x < 11$, we find that $x$ can be any integer from 2 to 10, inclusive. This range satisfies all three inequalities.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the positive difference between the greatest and least possible integral values of $x$.\nThe greatest possible integral value of $x$ is 10, and the least possible integral value of $x$ is 2. The positive difference between these values is $10 - 2 = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"
