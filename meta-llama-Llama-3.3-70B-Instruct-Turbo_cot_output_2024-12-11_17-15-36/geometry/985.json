    "solution": "At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{2}{3}(360^\\circ)=240$ degrees.  Every minute, the minute hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}(360^\\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12} (360^\\circ)=0.5$ degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.  After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\\circ-5.5^\\circ\\cdot 15=\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the movement of the hour and minute hands\nAt 8:15, the minute hand will be exactly on the 3 (since 15 minutes have passed and each number on the clock represents 5 minutes) and the hour hand will be between the 8 and the 9.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the position of the hour hand\nThe hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which means it moves 30 degrees per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it moves 0.5 degrees per minute. At 8:00, the hour hand is at 240 degrees (since 8 * 30 = 240). After 15 minutes, it moves an additional 15 * 0.5 = 7.5 degrees. So, the hour hand is at 240 + 7.5 = 247.5 degrees.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the position of the minute hand\nThe minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which means it moves 6 degrees per minute. At 8:15, the minute hand is at 15 * 6 = 90 degrees.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the smaller angle between the hour and minute hands\nTo find the smaller angle, we need to find the absolute difference between the positions of the hour and minute hands. The difference is |247.5 - 90| = 157.5 degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{157.5}$"
