    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the given function\nThe function $f(x,y,z) = \\frac{x}{x + y} + \\frac{y}{y + z} + \\frac{z}{z + x}$ involves the variables $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ as positive real numbers.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the function's structure\nEach term in the function is a fraction where the numerator is one of the variables, and the denominator is the sum of that variable and another variable.\n\n## Step 3: Finding the lower bound\nSince $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are positive, we notice that each fraction is less than 1 because the numerator is always less than the denominator. Thus, $f(x,y,z) < 3$.\n\n## Step 4: Finding the upper bound\nBy observing that $\\frac{x}{x + y} > \\frac{x}{x + y + z}$, $\\frac{y}{y + z} > \\frac{y}{x + y + z}$, and $\\frac{z}{z + x} > \\frac{z}{x + y + z}$, we can sum these inequalities to get $f(x,y,z) > \\frac{x + y + z}{x + y + z} = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Examining the function's behavior\nGiven that $f(x,y,z) > 1$ and $f(x,y,z) < 3$, we now need to determine if there are specific values of $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ that allow $f(x,y,z)$ to approach 1 or 3, or if there are values in between that $f(x,y,z)$ cannot attain.\n\n## Step 6: Checking for the lower limit\nTo check if $f(x,y,z)$ can approach 1, consider the case where one of the variables is much larger than the others. For instance, let $z$ be much larger than $x$ and $y$. Then, $\\frac{x}{x + y}$ and $\\frac{y}{y + z}$ approach 1 and 0 respectively, while $\\frac{z}{z + x}$ approaches 1. This suggests that $f(x,y,z)$ can indeed approach values close to 1 but not exactly 1 due to the strict inequalities.\n\n## Step 7: Checking for the upper limit\nSimilarly, to check if $f(x,y,z)$ can approach 3, consider the scenario where $x = y = z$. In this case, each fraction becomes $\\frac{1}{2}$, and thus $f(x,y,z) = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\n## Step 8: Conclusion on the range of $f(x,y,z)$\nGiven the analysis, $f(x,y,z)$ can take on values between 1 and 2, but cannot be exactly 1 or 3. However, we need to consider all possible combinations and the behavior as variables approach certain values.\n\n## Step 9: Final consideration of the function's range\nSince we've established that $f(x,y,z)$ must be greater than 1 and less than 3, and we've found a specific case where $f(x,y,z) = \\frac{3}{2}$, we need to consider if there's a continuous range of values that $f(x,y,z)$ can take within these bounds.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(1,2)}$"
