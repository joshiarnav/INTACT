    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the Complex Conjugate Root Theorem\nThe Complex Conjugate Root Theorem states that if a polynomial equation with real coefficients has a complex root, then its complex conjugate is also a root of the polynomial. Therefore, if $-2 - i \\sqrt{5}$ is a root, then $-2 + i \\sqrt{5}$ must also be a root.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the Roots\nThe roots of the quadratic polynomial are $-2 - i \\sqrt{5}$ and $-2 + i \\sqrt{5}$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the Roots to Form the Quadratic Equation\nA monic quadratic polynomial can be written in factored form as $(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the roots. Substituting the given roots, we get $(x - (-2 - i \\sqrt{5}))(x - (-2 + i \\sqrt{5}))$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the Expression\nExpanding the expression gives $(x + 2 + i \\sqrt{5})(x + 2 - i \\sqrt{5})$. Using the difference of squares formula $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$, where $a = x + 2$ and $b = i \\sqrt{5}$, we simplify further to $(x + 2)^2 - (i \\sqrt{5})^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Continue Simplifying\nExpanding $(x + 2)^2$ gives $x^2 + 4x + 4$. Since $i^2 = -1$, then $(i \\sqrt{5})^2 = -5$. So, the expression simplifies to $x^2 + 4x + 4 - (-5)$.\n\n## Step 6: Final Simplification\nCombining like terms, $x^2 + 4x + 4 + 5 = x^2 + 4x + 9$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{x^2 + 4x + 9}$"
