    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recognize the function type\nThe given function $f(x) = ax^6 + bx^4 - cx^2 + 3$ is a polynomial of even powers of $x$, which means it is an even function.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the property of even functions\nAn even function has the property that $f(x) = f(-x)$ for all $x$ in its domain. This is because the function's graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the property to the given problem\nSince $f(x)$ is an even function, we can write $f(91) = f(-91)$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate $f(91) + f(-91)$\nGiven that $f(91) = 1$ and knowing $f(91) = f(-91)$, we can substitute to find $f(91) + f(-91) = 1 + 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Compute the sum\nPerforming the addition gives us $f(91) + f(-91) = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
