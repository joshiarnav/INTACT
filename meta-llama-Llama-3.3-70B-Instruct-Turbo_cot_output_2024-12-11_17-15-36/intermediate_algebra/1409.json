    "solution": "Let $y$ be a number in the range of $f.$ This means that there is a real number $x$ such that \\[y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}.\\]Multiplying both sides by $x^2-x+1$ and rearranging, we get the equation \\[yx^2-(y+1)x+y=0.\\]Since $x^2-x+1 = (x-\\tfrac12)^2 + \\tfrac34 > 0$ for all $x,$ our steps are reversible, so $y$ is in the range of $f$ if and only if this equation has a real solution for $x.$ In turn, this equation has a real solution for $x$ if and only if the discriminant of this quadratic is nonnegative. Therefore, the range of $f$ consists exactly of the values of $y$ which satisfy \\[(y+1)^2 - 4y^2 \\ge 0,\\]or \\[0 \\ge 3y^2 - 2y - 1.\\]This quadratic factors as \\[0 \\ge (3y+1)(y-1),\\]which means that the solutions to the inequality are given by $-\\tfrac13 \\le y \\le 1.$ Therefore, the range of $g$ is the closed interval $\\boxed{[-\\tfrac13, 1]}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the range of the function $f(x) = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}$, we need to determine all possible output values (y-values) that the function can produce for any real number input $x$.\nThe function is defined for all real numbers $x$ because the denominator $x^2 - x + 1$ is never equal to zero for any real $x$. This is due to the fact that the discriminant of the quadratic equation $x^2 - x + 1 = 0$ is $(-1)^2 - 4(1)(1) = -3$, which is negative, indicating that the quadratic equation has no real roots.\n\n## Step 2: Let $y = \\frac{x}{x^2-x+1}$. To find the range, we need to express $x$ in terms of $y$ and see what possible values $y$ can take.\nRearranging the equation gives us $y(x^2 - x + 1) = x$, which simplifies to $yx^2 - (y + 1)x + y = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$.\n\n## Step 3: For $y$ to be in the range of $f$, the quadratic equation $yx^2 - (y + 1)x + y = 0$ must have a real solution for $x$.\nThe discriminant $\\Delta$ of this quadratic equation is given by $\\Delta = (y + 1)^2 - 4(y)(y) = y^2 + 2y + 1 - 4y^2 = -3y^2 + 2y + 1$.\nFor the equation to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative: $\\Delta \\geq 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the inequality $-3y^2 + 2y + 1 \\geq 0$ to find the values of $y$ for which the quadratic has real solutions.\nFirst, we can find the roots of the equation $-3y^2 + 2y + 1 = 0$ by using the quadratic formula $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = -3$, $b = 2$, and $c = 1$.\nThe roots are given by $y = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(-3)(1)}}{2(-3)} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 12}}{-6} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{16}}{-6} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 4}{-6}$.\nThus, $y = \\frac{-2 + 4}{-6} = \\frac{2}{-6} = -\\frac{1}{3}$ or $y = \\frac{-2 - 4}{-6} = \\frac{-6}{-6} = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: The inequality $-3y^2 + 2y + 1 \\geq 0$ will be satisfied between the roots of the equation $-3y^2 + 2y + 1 = 0$ because the coefficient of $y^2$ (which is $-3$) is negative, meaning the parabola opens downwards.\nTherefore, the solution to the inequality is $-\\frac{1}{3} \\leq y \\leq 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[-\\frac{1}{3}, 1]}$"
