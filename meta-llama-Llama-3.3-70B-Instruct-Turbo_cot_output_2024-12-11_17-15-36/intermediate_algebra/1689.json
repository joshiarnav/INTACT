    "solution": "We can obtain the graph of $y = g(x)$ by taking the graph of $y = f(x)$ and stretching it horizontally by a factor of 2, then shifting it down by 4 units.  Therefore, $g(x) = f \\left( \\frac{x}{2} \\right) - 4.$  This means $(a,b,c) = \\boxed{\\left( 1, \\frac{1}{2}, -4 \\right)}.$\n\nMore generally, for $c > 1,$ the graph of $y = f \\left( \\frac{x}{c} \\right)$ is obtained by stretching the graph of $y = f(x)$ horizontally by factor of $c.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understanding the problem and the transformation of the function f(x) to g(x)\nThe problem involves understanding how the function f(x) is transformed into g(x) through the equation g(x) = af(bx) + c. We need to identify the constants a, b, and c that define this transformation.\n\n## Step 2: Identifying the transformation applied to f(x) to obtain g(x)\nBy comparing the graphs of y = f(x) and y = g(x), we can observe the transformations applied to f(x). The graph of g(x) appears to be a vertical shift and a horizontal stretch of the graph of f(x).\n\n## Step 3: Determining the value of b\nThe horizontal stretch can be determined by comparing the x-coordinates of corresponding points on the two graphs. It seems that the graph of g(x) is stretched horizontally by a factor of 2, as the same shape and features of f(x) are now spread over twice the horizontal distance. This indicates that b = 1/2, since the transformation involves bx and we observe a stretch by a factor of 2.\n\n## Step 4: Determining the value of c\nThe vertical shift can be identified by comparing the y-coordinates of corresponding points on the two graphs. The graph of g(x) appears to be shifted down by 4 units compared to the graph of f(x). This shift corresponds to the value of c in the transformation equation, so c = -4.\n\n## Step 5: Determining the value of a\nSince there is no apparent vertical stretch or compression in the transformation from f(x) to g(x), we can conclude that a = 1. This is because the vertical scale of the graph remains unchanged.\n\n## Step 6: Combining the values of a, b, and c\nWith the individual values of a, b, and c determined, we can now combine them into the ordered triple (a, b, c) that defines the transformation.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(1, \\frac{1}{2}, -4)}$"
