    "problem": "Given that $2+\\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the equation \\[x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10 = 0\\]and that $a$ and $b$ are rational numbers, compute $b.$",
    "solution": "Because the coefficients of the polynomial are rational, the radical conjugate $2-\\sqrt{3}$ must also be a root of the polynomial. By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of this polynomial is $-10,$ and the product of these two roots is $(2+\\sqrt3)(2-\\sqrt3) = 1,$ so the remaining root must be $\\frac{-10}{1} = -10.$ Then by Vieta's formulas again, we have \\[b = (-10)(2-\\sqrt3) + (-10)(2+\\sqrt3) + (2+\\sqrt3)(2-\\sqrt3) = \\boxed{-39}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recognize that if $2+\\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the given polynomial, then its conjugate, $2-\\sqrt{3}$, must also be a root because the coefficients of the polynomial are rational.\nThis is due to the Complex Conjugate Root Theorem, which states that if a polynomial equation has rational coefficients and $a+bi$ (where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $b \\neq 0$) is a root, then its complex conjugate, $a-bi$, is also a root.\n\n## Step 2: Use the fact that the product of the roots of a cubic equation $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-c$ (for our case, $-10$), and the sum of the roots is $-a$.\nSince we have two roots, $2+\\sqrt{3}$ and $2-\\sqrt{3}$, we can find their product, which will help us find the third root.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the product of the two known roots to find part of the factorization of the polynomial.\nThe product of $2+\\sqrt{3}$ and $2-\\sqrt{3}$ is $(2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3}) = 2^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Since the product of all roots must be $-10$ and the product of two roots is $1$, we can find the third root.\nLet $r$ be the third root. Then, $(2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3})r = -10$. Since $(2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3}) = 1$, we have $1 \\cdot r = -10$, which means $r = -10$.\n\n## Step 5: With all roots identified ($2+\\sqrt{3}$, $2-\\sqrt{3}$, and $-10$), use Vieta's formulas to calculate $b$.\nVieta's formulas tell us that for a cubic equation $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, $b$ is the sum of all distinct possible products of two roots at a time. Given roots $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$, $b = r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1$.\n\n## Step 6: Apply Vieta's formula for $b$ with our roots.\nWe already know that $(2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3}) = 1$. We need to calculate $(2+\\sqrt{3})(-10)$ and $(2-\\sqrt{3})(-10)$ and then sum these products.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate $(2+\\sqrt{3})(-10)$ and $(2-\\sqrt{3})(-10)$.\n$(2+\\sqrt{3})(-10) = -20 - 10\\sqrt{3}$ and $(2-\\sqrt{3})(-10) = -20 + 10\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n## Step 8: Sum the products from Step 7 with the product from Step 3 to find $b$.\n$b = 1 + (-20 - 10\\sqrt{3}) + (-20 + 10\\sqrt{3})$. Notice that the $10\\sqrt{3}$ terms cancel out.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the expression for $b$.\n$b = 1 - 20 - 20 = 1 - 40 = -39$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-39}$"
