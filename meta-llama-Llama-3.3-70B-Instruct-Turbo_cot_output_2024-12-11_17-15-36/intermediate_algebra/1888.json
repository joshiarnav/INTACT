    "problem": "A parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is reflected about the $x$-axis. The parabola and its reflection are translated horizontally five units in opposite directions to become the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$, respectively. Which of the following describes the graph of $y=(f+g)(x)$?\n\n(A) a parabola tangent to the $x$-axis\n(B) a parabola not tangent to the $x$-axis\n(C) a horizontal line\n(D) a non-horizontal line\n(E) the graph of a cubic function",
    "solution": "Write the equation of the original parabola as $y = a(x - h)^2 + k,$ where $a \\neq 0.$  Then the equation of the reflected parabola is\n\\[y = -a(x - h)^2 - k.\\]When the parabolas are translated horizontally by 5 units, in opposite directions, their equations become\n\\[y = a(x - h \\pm 5)^2 + k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -a(x - h \\mp 5)^2 - k.\\]The sum of these expressions is\n\\[\\pm 20ax \\mp 20ah = \\pm 20a (x - h),\\]which is the equation of a non-horizontal line.  The answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(D)}}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the initial transformation\nThe parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is reflected about the $x$-axis. This means its equation becomes $y = -ax^2 - bx - c$ after reflection.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the horizontal translation\nThe original parabola is translated 5 units to the right, so its equation becomes $y = a(x - 5)^2 + b(x - 5) + c$. The reflected parabola is translated 5 units to the left, so its equation becomes $y = -a(x + 5)^2 - b(x + 5) - c$.\n\n## Step 3: Expand the translated equations\nFor the original parabola translated to the right: $y = a(x^2 - 10x + 25) + b(x - 5) + c = ax^2 - 10ax + 25a + bx - 5b + c$.\nFor the reflected parabola translated to the left: $y = -a(x^2 + 10x + 25) - b(x + 5) - c = -ax^2 - 10ax - 25a - bx - 5b - c$.\n\n## Step 4: Combine the equations to find $(f+g)(x)$\nAdding the two equations: $(f+g)(x) = (ax^2 - 10ax + 25a + bx - 5b + c) + (-ax^2 - 10ax - 25a - bx - 5b - c)$.\nSimplifying, we get: $(f+g)(x) = -20ax - 10b$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the result\nThe equation $(f+g)(x) = -20ax - 10b$ represents a linear function because it is in the form $y = mx + b$, where $m = -20a$ and $b = -10b$. This means the graph of $y = (f+g)(x)$ is a non-horizontal line unless $a = 0$, but since $a$ is a coefficient of a parabola, assuming $a \\neq 0$ gives us a non-horizontal line.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(D)}$"
