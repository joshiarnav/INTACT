    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the remainder when a polynomial is divided by another polynomial, we can use polynomial long division or the remainder theorem.\nThe remainder theorem states that if we divide a polynomial f(x) by (x - a), the remainder is f(a). However, since we are dividing by 2x - 6, we need to rearrange it into the form (x - a) to apply the theorem directly.\n\n## Step 2: Rearrange the divisor 2x - 6 into the form (x - a).\n2x - 6 can be rewritten as 2(x - 3), which means a = 3.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the remainder theorem by substituting x = 3 into the polynomial $6x^4-14x^3-4x^2+2x-26$.\nSubstitute x = 3 into the polynomial: $6(3)^4-14(3)^3-4(3)^2+2(3)-26$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the value of the polynomial at x = 3.\n$6(3)^4 = 6 * 81 = 486$, $14(3)^3 = 14 * 27 = 378$, $4(3)^2 = 4 * 9 = 36$, $2(3) = 6$, and the constant term is -26.\nSo, $486 - 378 - 36 + 6 - 26$.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the arithmetic to find the remainder.\n$486 - 378 = 108$, $108 - 36 = 72$, $72 + 6 = 78$, and $78 - 26 = 52$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{52}$"
