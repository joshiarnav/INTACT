    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nThe problem asks us to find the maximum value of the expression $\\frac{x + 2y + 3}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + 1}}$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify a relevant inequality or principle\nTo find the maximum value of the given expression, we can utilize the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for all vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ in an inner product space, it holds that $(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b})^2 \\leq (\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{a})(\\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{b})$. This can be extended to real numbers as well.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz! inequality\nApplying Cauchy-Schwarz to the given expression, we treat $x$, $y$, and $1$ as the components of vector $\\mathbf{a}$ and $1$, $2$, and $3$ as the components of vector $\\mathbf{b}$. The inequality tells us that $(x \\cdot 1 + y \\cdot 2 + 1 \\cdot 3)^2 \\leq (x^2 + y^2 + 1)(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2)$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the inequality\nSimplifying, we get $(x + 2y + 3)^2 \\leq (x^2 + y^2 + 1)(1 + 4 + 9)$, which further simplifies to $(x + 2y + 3)^2 \\leq 14(x^2 + y^2 + 1)$.\n\n## Step 5: Relate the inequality to the original expression\nTaking the square root of both sides, we obtain $\\frac{x + 2y + 3}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + 1}} \\leq \\sqrt{14}$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the conditions for equality\nEquality in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality occurs when the two vectors are linearly dependent, i.e., one is a scalar multiple of the other. For our purposes, this means $x = k \\cdot 1$, $y = k \\cdot 2$, and $1 = k \\cdot 3$ for some scalar $k$. Solving these equations simultaneously will give us the values of $x$ and $y$ for which the maximum is achieved.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for the scalar and find x and y\nFrom $1 = k \\cdot 3$, we find $k = \\frac{1}{3}$. Then, $x = \\frac{1}{3}$ and $y = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n## Step 8: Conclude the maximum value\nSubstituting $x = \\frac{1}{3}$ and $y = \\frac{2}{3}$ into the original expression, we can verify that this indeed yields the maximum value. However, since we've established through Cauchy-Schwarz that $\\frac{x + 2y + 3}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + 1}} \\leq \\sqrt{14}$, and the equality condition is satisfied for specific $x$ and $y$, $\\sqrt{14}$ is the maximum value.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{14}}$"
