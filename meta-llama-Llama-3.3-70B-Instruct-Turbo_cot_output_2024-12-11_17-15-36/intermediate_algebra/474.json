    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the minimum value of the given expression, we can use calculus, specifically the concept of derivatives.\nWe have the function $f(x) = 4x^5 + 5x^{-4}$. To find its minimum, we'll first find its derivative with respect to $x$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$.\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get $f'(x) = 20x^4 - 20x^{-5}$.\n\n## Step 3: Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points.\nSetting $f'(x) = 0$, we have $20x^4 - 20x^{-5} = 0$. This simplifies to $x^4 = x^{-5}$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation from step 3 for $x$.\nMultiplying both sides by $x^5$ to clear the fraction gives $x^9 = 1$. Since $x$ is a positive real number, the solution is $x = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the nature of the critical point.\nTo confirm that $x = 1$ corresponds to a minimum, we can use the second derivative test. The second derivative of $f(x)$ is $f''(x) = 80x^3 + 100x^{-6}$.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the second derivative at the critical point.\nSubstituting $x = 1$ into $f''(x)$ gives $f''(1) = 80 + 100 = 180$. Since $f''(1) > 0$, $x = 1$ is indeed a minimum.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the minimum value of the original function.\nSubstitute $x = 1$ into the original function $f(x) = 4x^5 + 5x^{-4}$ to find the minimum value. This gives $f(1) = 4(1)^5 + 5(1)^{-4} = 4 + 5 = 9$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$"
