    "problem": "You have a rectangular prism box with length $x+5$ units, width $x-5$ units, and height $x^{2}+25$ units. For how many positive integer values of $x$ is the volume of the box less than 700 units?",
    "solution": "To find the volume of the box, we multiply the three dimensions: $(x+5)(x-5)(x^{2}+25) = (x^{2}-25)(x^{2}+25) = x^{4}-625$. We want to find $x$ such that $x^{4}-625<700$, which simplifies to $x^{4}<1325$. Taking the fourth root shows us that $x$ is less than $\\sqrt[4]{1325}$, which is between 6 and 7 (since $6^4=1296$ while $7^4=2401$). So $x$ could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, we see that the width is $x-5$ units, and this must be a positive number, so the only value of $x$ which works is 6. Thus, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ possible value of $x$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Determine the formula for the volume of the box\nThe volume \\(V\\) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula \\(V = length \\times width \\times height\\). In this problem, the length is \\(x + 5\\), the width is \\(x - 5\\), and the height is \\(x^2 + 25\\). So, the volume formula for this box is \\(V = (x + 5)(x - 5)(x^2 + 25)\\).\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the volume formula\nWe can simplify the volume formula by recognizing that \\((x + 5)(x - 5) = x^2 - 25\\). Thus, the volume formula simplifies to \\(V = (x^2 - 25)(x^2 + 25)\\).\n\n## Step 3: Further simplify the volume formula\nRecognizing that \\((x^2 - 25)(x^2 + 25) = x^4 - 625\\), the simplified volume formula is \\(V = x^4 - 625\\).\n\n## Step 4: Set up the inequality for the volume condition\nThe problem states that the volume of the box must be less than 700 units. So, we set up the inequality \\(x^4 - 625 < 700\\).\n\n## Step 5: Solve the inequality\nSolving the inequality \\(x^4 - 625 < 700\\), we first add 625 to both sides to get \\(x^4 < 1325\\).\n\n## Step 6: Find the fourth root of both sides\nTaking the fourth root of both sides of the inequality \\(x^4 < 1325\\), we get \\(x < \\sqrt[4]{1325}\\).\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the fourth root of 1325\nCalculating \\(\\sqrt[4]{1325}\\) gives us approximately \\(6.88\\).\n\n## Step 8: Consider the constraints on x\nSince the width of the box is \\(x - 5\\), and a dimension cannot be negative or zero, \\(x - 5 > 0\\), which means \\(x > 5\\). Also, since \\(x\\) must be a positive integer and \\(x < 6.88\\), we consider integers greater than 5 and less than 6.88.\n\n## Step 9: Identify the positive integer values of x satisfying the conditions\nGiven \\(x > 5\\) and \\(x < 6.88\\), the only positive integer value of \\(x\\) that satisfies these conditions is \\(6\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"
