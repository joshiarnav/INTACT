This is equal to $625+5184$.\n\n## Step 2: Perform the addition to find the value of $25^2+72^2$\nPerforming the addition, we get $625+5184 = 5809$.\n\n## Step 3: Factorize 5809 to find its prime divisors\nNow, we need to factorize 5809 to find its prime divisors. We start by checking divisibility by the smallest prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.) and move upwards.\n\n## Step 4: Determine if 5809 is a prime number or find its largest prime divisor\nAfter attempting to divide 5809 by several small prime numbers, we find that it is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, or 47. Checking further, we can see that $5809 = 37 \\times 157$, and both 37 and 157 are prime numbers.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the largest prime divisor of $25^2+72^2$\nFrom the factorization $5809 = 37 \\times 157$, we can see that the largest prime divisor of $25^2+72^2$ is 157.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{157}$"
