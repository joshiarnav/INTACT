    "solution": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7. So the residue of the sum is  $$\n182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\equiv \\boxed{10} \\pmod{14}.\n$$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Calculate the first term of the expression, $182\\cdot 12$, and find its residue modulo 14.\nTo find the residue of $182\\cdot 12 \\pmod{14}$, first calculate $182\\cdot 12 = 2184$. Since $2184 \\div 14 = 156$ with a remainder of $0$, the residue of $182\\cdot 12 \\pmod{14}$ is $0$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the second term of the expression, $15\\cdot 7$, and find its residue modulo 14.\nTo find the residue of $15\\cdot 7 \\pmod{14}$, first calculate $15\\cdot 7 = 105$. Since $105 \\div 14 = 7$ with a remainder of $7$, the residue of $15\\cdot 7 \\pmod{14}$ is $7$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the third term of the expression, $3$, and find its residue modulo 14.\nThe residue of $3 \\pmod{14}$ is simply $3$ since $3$ is less than $14$.\n\n## Step 4: Combine the residues from the previous steps to find the overall residue of the expression $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\pmod{14}$.\nNow, combine the residues: $0 - 7 + 3 = -4$. To ensure the answer is within the range of $0$ to $13$ (the possible residues modulo 14), add $14$ to $-4$ to get $10$. Thus, the residue of the entire expression modulo 14 is $10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
