    "problem": "What is the maximum possible value of the greatest common divisor of two consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n = n! + n$, where $n \\ge 0$?",
    "solution": "We start by taking the first step in the Euclidean algorithm: subtract the initial two terms. Notice that\n\\begin{align*}a_{n+1} - (n+1)a_n &= (n+1)! + n + 1 - (n+1)(n! + n) \\\\ &= (n+1)! + n + 1 - (n+1)! - n(n+1) \\\\ &= -n^2 + 1 = -(n-1)(n+1).\n\\end{align*}It follows that by the Euclidean Algorithm, \\begin{align*}\\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, a_{n+1}) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, a_{n+1} - (n+1)a_n)\\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, (n-1)(n+1)),\\end{align*}since the minus sign is irrelevant for calculating the gcd.\n\nWe know that $n-1$ divides $n!$, so that $n-1$ is relatively prime to $a_n = n! + n$:\n$$\\text{gcd}\\,(n-1,n!+n) = \\text{gcd}\\,(n-1,n) = 1.$$Thus, we can ignore the factor of $n-1$ completely, and say that\n$$\\text{gcd}\\,(a_n,a_{n+1}) = \\text{gcd}\\,(n! + n, n+1).$$Now, we have several cases, depending on whether $n+1$ is prime or composite. We also have a few edge cases to consider. The basic idea is that when $n+1$ is composite and greater than $4$, $n+1$ is a factor of $n!$, whereas when $n+1$ is prime, we can apply Wilson's Theorem.\n\n$\\textit{Case 0:}$ For $n = 0$, we find that $a_0 = 1, a_1 = 2$, with greatest common divisor $1$.\n\n$\\textit{Case composite:}$\n\n$\\qquad \\textit{Subcase 1:}$ If $n+1$ is composite and can be written as the product of two distinct integers greater than $1$ (say $n+1 = a \\times b$, $a > b > 1$), then $n+1$ divides\n$$n! = 1 \\times \\cdots \\times b \\times \\cdots \\times a \\times \\cdots \\times n.$$By the same argument as before, since $n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime, then $n! + n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime, yielding a greatest common divisor of $1$.\n\n$\\qquad \\textit{Subcase 2:}$ If $n+1 = p^2$ for some prime $p$, then $n! + n = (p^2 - 1)! + p^2-1$. If $2p < p^2 - 1$, then $p$ and $2p$ are both factors that appear in the expansion of $n!$, so $n+1$ divides $n!$ and the previous argument applies. For $p = 2$, we can quickly check that $3! + 3 = 9$ is relatively prime with $4$.\n\n$\\textit{Case prime:}$ If $n + 1 = p$ for some prime $p$, then $n! + n \\equiv (p-1)! + (p-1) \\equiv -2 \\pmod{p}$ by Wilson's Theorem. Thus, $n! + n$ is relatively prime with $n+1$ unless $n = 1$, for which we obtain $a_1 = 2, a_2 = 4$, with greatest common divisor 2.\n\nSo, the largest the greatest common divisor of two consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n$ can be is $\\boxed{2}$, which is achieved when we take $n=1$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the sequence $a_n = n! + n$\nThe sequence is defined as $a_n = n! + n$, where $n$ starts from $0$. This means the first few terms of the sequence are $a_0 = 0! + 0 = 1$, $a_1 = 1! + 1 = 2$, $a_2 = 2! + 2 = 4$, $a_3 = 3! + 3 = 9$, and so on.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the formula for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two consecutive terms\nTo find the GCD of two consecutive terms, we need to examine $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$. The GCD of these two terms can be found using the Euclidean algorithm or by analyzing the factors of the terms.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the factors of consecutive terms\nFor $n \\ge 2$, $a_n = n! + n$ and $a_{n+1} = (n+1)! + (n+1)$. Notice that $a_{n+1}$ includes $n!$ as a factor within $(n+1)! = (n+1) \\cdot n!$. This means that any common factor of $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$ must also be a factor of $n$ and $n+1$, since $n!$ is a multiple of all integers up to $n$.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the potential GCD for small values of $n$\nGiven that $n!$ grows very rapidly and includes all smaller integers as factors, for $n \\ge 2$, the only possible common factors between $n! + n$ and $(n+1)! + (n+1)$ would be factors that are common to $n$ and $n+1$, which are limited to $1$ since consecutive integers are coprime.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the GCD for the first few terms explicitly\n- For $n=0$, $a_0 = 1$ and $a_1 = 2$, GCD is $1$.\n- For $n=1$, $a_1 = 2$ and $a_2 = 4$, GCD is $2$.\n- For $n=2$, $a_2 = 4$ and $a_3 = 9$, GCD is $1$.\nGiven the rapid growth of $n!$, for $n > 1$, the GCD will generally be $1$ because $n!$ and $(n+1)!$ have all previous integers as factors, but adding $n$ or $n+1$ does not introduce a common factor due to the nature of consecutive integers being coprime.\n\n## Step 6: Conclusion on maximum possible GCD\nFrom the analysis, the maximum possible GCD of two consecutive terms in the sequence $a_n = n! + n$ is achieved when $n=1$, yielding a GCD of $2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
