    "problem": "What is the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25?",
    "solution": "Every multiple of 25 ends in 00, 25, 50, or 75.  Since we want the product of the digits to be a positive multiple of 25, the final two digits must be either 25 or 75.\n\nA nonzero product of digits is a multiple of 25 exactly when two or more of the digits is are equal to 5. If a number ends in 75 and the product of its digits is a multiple of 25, then replacing 75 by 25 in that number will also give a smaller number whose product of digits is a multiple of 25.  Therefore we are looking for a number whose final two digits are 25 and for which 5 is one of the other digits.\n\nSince 525 is the smallest such number, the answer must be $\\boxed{525}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem requirements\nTo find the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25, we need to consider the properties of multiples of 25 and how they relate to the product of their digits.\n\n## Step 2: Identify key properties of multiples of 25\nMultiples of 25 always end in 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since we are looking for the least positive multiple, we should start by examining the smallest possible multiples that meet the criteria.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the product of digits requirement\nFor the product of the digits of a number to be a multiple of 25, the number must contain at least one 5 (since 5 is a prime factor of 25) because any number multiplied by 5 gives a multiple of 5, and if another 5 is present, it would give a multiple of 25.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze possible numbers\nStarting with the smallest possible multiples of 25:\n- Numbers ending in 00 do not contribute any value to the product of digits (since 0 multiplied by any number is 0), so they cannot be part of the solution unless there's another digit that is 5.\n- Numbers ending in 25 have a product of digits that includes 2 and 5, which gives 10, not a multiple of 25.\n- Numbers ending in 50 have a product of digits that includes 5 and 0, resulting in 0, which is not a positive multiple of 25.\n- Numbers ending in 75 have a product of digits that includes 7 and 5, giving 35, not a multiple of 25.\n\n## Step 5: Explore larger multiples of 25 for the digit product requirement\nGiven the constraints from step 4, we need to look for larger multiples of 25 where the product of the digits could be a multiple of 25. A straightforward approach is to include more digits that are multiples of 5 or include a 5 twice to ensure the product of digits is a multiple of 25.\n\n## Step 6: Find the smallest number meeting the criteria\nSince we need at least two 5s in the number for the product of its digits to be a multiple of 25, the smallest such number would logically include \"525\" as part of it because \"5*5*2 = 50\", which is a multiple of 25. However, we also need to ensure the entire number is a multiple of 25.\n\n## Step 7: Construct the smallest number\nThe smallest multiple of 25 that can be constructed with \"525\" and still be a multiple of 25 is 525 itself. However, we must verify if 525 is indeed a multiple of 25.\n\n## Step 8: Verify if 525 is a multiple of 25\n525 divided by 25 equals 21, confirming that 525 is indeed a multiple of 25.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{525}$"
