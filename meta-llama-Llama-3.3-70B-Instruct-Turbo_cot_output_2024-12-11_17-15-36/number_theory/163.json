    "problem": "What is the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 which has two even and two odd digits?",
    "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the smallest positive four-digit number that is divisible by 9 and has two even and two odd digits, we need to remember the rules for divisibility by 9.\nA number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 2: The smallest four-digit number is 1000, but we need to ensure it has two even and two odd digits and is divisible by 9.\nLet's start with the smallest possible digits to form a four-digit number that meets the criteria of having two even and two odd digits. The smallest even digits we can use are 0 and 2, and the smallest odd digits are 1 and 3, or 1 and 5, or 1 and 7, etc.\n\n## Step 3: Considering the smallest digits that can form a number with two even and two odd digits, we start with 1000 as a base, but it doesn't fit our criteria since it doesn't have two odd digits.\nHowever, to minimize the number while ensuring it's a four-digit number and meets our criteria, we can start arranging from the smallest possible digits that fit the rule, such as 0, 2 (for even) and 1, 3 (for odd), but we need to ensure the sum of these digits is divisible by 9 for the entire number to be divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 4: The sum of the digits 0, 2, 1, and 3 is 6, which is not divisible by 9.\nWe need to increase these digits while keeping the number as small as possible and ensuring it remains a four-digit number with two even and two odd digits, and the sum of the digits must be divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 5: Let's try increasing the digits to achieve the smallest possible number that meets all the criteria.\nWe aim for the smallest sum of digits that is divisible by 9. The smallest possible sum divisible by 9 that is greater than 6 (from 0+2+1+3) and can be achieved with small digits is 9 itself. However, with the digits 0, 1, 2, and 3, we cannot achieve a sum of! 9 without repeating digits or using larger digits.\n\n## Step 6: To get a sum of digits divisible by 9, let's consider the next possible combination of small digits that can give us a sum of 9 or a multiple of 9.\nUsing 0, 2 (even) and 1, 7 (odd) gives us a sum of 10, which is still not divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 7: Considering the next smallest combination that could give us a sum divisible by 9, we look at other small digits.\nThe combination 0, 8 (even) and 1, 0 (but we can't use two zeros in a four-digit number without it being less than 1000), so we consider other combinations like 2, 8 (even) and 1, 7 (odd) which gives us a sum of 18.\n\n## Step 8: The sum of 18 is divisible by 9, which means the digits 2, 8, 1, and 7 can form a number that is divisible by 9.\nNow, we arrange these digits to form the smallest possible four-digit number: 1028, 1082, 1208, 1280, 1728, 1802, 1820, 2018, 2081, 2108, 2180, 2801, 2810, 2820, 8012, 8102, 8120, 8201, 8210, 8280, 8102, and 8120 are some possible combinations but we need the smallest.\n\n## Step 9: Among these combinations, the smallest number that meets all the criteria is 1089, no, we made a mistake, 1089 has three odd digits (1, 8 is even, 9 is odd) and doesn't fit our exact criteria of two even and two odd digits. Let's correct this by finding the right arrangement of 2, 8, 1, and 7.\nThe correct smallest arrangement with two even (2, 8) and two odd (1, 7) digits that also forms a number divisible by 9 is actually 1028, 1082, etc., but considering the mistake in step 8 about the sum and arrangement, let's focus on forming a correct number with the right digits that sum up to a multiple of 9.\n\n## Step 10: Correcting our approach, the smallest possible digits to achieve a sum divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits should directly lead us to the correct answer without trial and error.\nWe are looking for the smallest four-digit number with two even and two odd digits, and its digits must sum to a multiple of 9. The mistake was in not systematically finding the smallest combination that meets all criteria directly.\n\n## Step 11: Directly constructing the smallest number that fits all given conditions.\nTo achieve a sum of digits that is divisible by 9 with the smallest possible digits, we should reconsider the combination of digits more systematically.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1089}$"
