    "problem": "What is the greatest common divisor of $1729$ and $1768$?",
    "solution": "By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768 - 1729) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 39).\n\\end{align*}Since the sum of the digits of $1729$ is $19$, which is not divisible by $3$, it suffices to check whether or not $1729$ is divisible by $13$. We can find that it is by long division or noting that $12+1 = \\boxed{13}$ divides into $1729 = 12^3 + 1^3$ using the sum of cubes factorization.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Recall the definition of the greatest common divisor (GCD)\nThe greatest common divisor of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n## Step 2: Choose a method for finding the GCD\nWe will use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 1729 and 1768. The Euclidean algorithm is a systematic way of finding the GCD of two numbers.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Euclidean algorithm\nTo apply the algorithm, we divide the larger number by the smaller number and then replace the larger number with the remainder of the division. We repeat this process until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the first step of the Euclidean algorithm\nDivide 1768 by 1729 to get 1 with a remainder of 39.\n\n## Step 5: Continue the Euclidean algorithm\nNext, divide 1729 by 39 to get 44 with a remainder of 13.\n\n## Step 6: Continue the Euclidean algorithm further\nDivide 39 by 13 to get 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\n## Step 7: Identify the GCD\nSince the last non-zero remainder is 13, the greatest common divisor of 1729 and 1768 is 13.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$"
