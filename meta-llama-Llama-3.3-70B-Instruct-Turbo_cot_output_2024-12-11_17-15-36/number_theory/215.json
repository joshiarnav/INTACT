    "problem": "What is the units digit of $13^{2003}$?",
    "solution": "Powers of 13 have the same units digit as the corresponding powers of 3; and $$\n3^1 = 3, \\quad 3^2 = 9, \\quad 3^3 = 27, \\quad 3^4 = 81, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 3^5 = 243.\n$$Since the units digit of $3^1$ is the same as the units digit of $3^5$, units digits of powers of 3 cycle through $3, 9, 7,$ and $1$. Hence the units digit of $3^{2000}$ is $1$, so the units digit of $3^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$. The same is true of the units digit of $13^{2003}$.",

We calculate the first few powers of 13 and observe their units digits.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the units digits of the first few powers of 13\nCalculating the units digits of $13^1, 13^2, 13^3, 13^4$:\n- $13^1 = 13$, units digit is 3.\n- $13^2 = 169$, units digit is 9.\n- $13^3 = 2197$, units digit is 7.\n- $13^4 = 28561$, units digit is 1.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the repeating pattern\nWe observed that the units digits of powers of 13 repeat every 4 powers: 3, 9, 7, 1, and then the pattern repeats.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the position of $13^{2003}$ in the pattern\nSince the pattern repeats every 4 powers, we need to find the remainder when 2003 is divided by 4 to determine which part of the pattern $13^{2003}$ falls into.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the remainder of 2003 divided by 4\n2003 divided by 4 equals 500 with a remainder of 3.\n\n## Step 7: Match the remainder to the pattern\nA remainder of 3 means that $13^{2003}$ falls into the third position in the pattern of units digits, which is 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
