    "problem": "Find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.",
    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we need to consider the properties of such a number.\nThe number must be divisible by its largest digit, which could be 9, 8, or 7, since we're looking for the largest possible number and it has to be a three-digit integer.\n\n## Step 2: Considering the largest possible digit for the hundreds place, we start with 9.\nIf the number starts with 9, it must be divisible by 9, meaning the sum of its digits must also be divisible by 9.\n\n## Step 3: Next, we consider the tens and units digits, which must also divide the number and be distinct from 9 and each other.\nGiven that we're aiming for the largest possible number, the tens digit should be as large as possible while allowing for a units digit that meets the criteria.\n\n## Step 4: We examine potential combinations starting with 9, looking for the largest possible number that meets the divisibility criteria for all its distinct, non-zero digits.\nSince the number must be divisible by its largest digit and all other distinct digits, we systematically check combinations starting from the highest possible values.\n\n## Step 5: After evaluating possible combinations, we identify the largest three-digit number meeting these conditions.\nThis involves checking divisibility by each distinct digit and ensuring the number is as large as possible.\n\n## Step 6: Upon finding potential candidates, we verify that each digit is distinct and non-zero, and that the entire number is divisible by each of these digits.\nThis step ensures that our solution meets all the specified conditions.\n\n## Step 7: Having considered the constraints and systematically evaluated possibilities, we determine the largest three-digit integer that satisfies all conditions.\nThis integer is the solution to our problem.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{936}$"
