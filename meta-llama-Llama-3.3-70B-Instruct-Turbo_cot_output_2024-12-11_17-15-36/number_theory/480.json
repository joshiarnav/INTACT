    "problem": "Let $g(n)$ be the product of the proper positive integer divisors of $n$. (Recall that a proper divisor of $n$ is a divisor other than $n$.) For how many values of $n$ does $n$ not divide $g(n)$, given that $2 \\le n \\le 50$?",
    "solution": "If $n$ is prime, then $g(n) = 1$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. The primes less than or equal to $50$ are $$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.$$There are $15$ of these primes. Also, if $n$ is the square of a prime, then $g(n) = \\sqrt{n}$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. By looking at the list of primes we already generated, we see that there are four perfect squares of primes less than $50$. If $n$ is any other composite integer, then it can be decomposed into the product of integers $a$ and $b$ with both integers greater than $1$. We have that $ab$ divides $g(n)$ (since $g(n)$ is the product of a collection of integers including $a$ and $b$). Since $ab=n$, this implies that $n$ divides $g(n)$. As a result, there are $15 + 4 = \\boxed{19}$ values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the definition of g(n)\nThe function $g(n)$ is defined as the product of the proper positive integer divisors of $n$. A proper divisor of $n$ is any divisor of $n$ excluding $n$ itself.\n\n## Step 2: Determine conditions for n to not divide g(n)\nFor $n$ to not divide $g(n)$, $n$ must have a prime factorization such that the product of its proper divisors does not include $n$ itself. This typically occurs when $n$ is a prime number, since a prime number's only proper divisors are $1$, and the product of these divisors ($1$) cannot be divided by $n$. Another case is when $n$ is the square of a prime, because its proper divisors will be $1$ and the prime, and their product will be the prime, which cannot be divided by $n$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify prime numbers from 2 to 50\nList the prime numbers between 2 and 50: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47$. These are numbers that have only two distinct divisors: $1$ and themselves.\n\n## Step 4: Identify square of prime numbers from 2 to 50\nList the square of prime numbers between 2 and 50: $4, 9, 25, 49$. These numbers have three distinct divisors: $1$, the prime, and the square of the prime.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total number of values of n\nAdd the number of prime numbers to the number of squares of prime numbers to find the total number of values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.\n\n## Step 6: Count the numbers\nCount the prime numbers: there are 15 primes.\nCount the squares of primes: there are 4 squares of primes.\n\n## Step 7: Sum the counts\nSum the counts from step 6: $15 + 4 = 19$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$"
