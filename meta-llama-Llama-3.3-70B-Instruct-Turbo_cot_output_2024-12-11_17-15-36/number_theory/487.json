    "model_solution": "## Step 1: First, we need to solve the given congruences to find the value of x.\nWe start by solving $4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$. To do this, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor of $4$ and $20$, which is $4$. This simplification yields $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$.\n\n## Step 2: Next, we solve the second congruence $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$.\nTo solve $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$, we can try to find an inverse of $3$ modulo $20$. However, since $3$ and $20$ are not coprime, we simplify the equation. Observing that $16\\equiv -4\\pmod{20}$, we can rewrite the equation as $3x\\equiv -4\\pmod{20}$. Multiplying both sides by $7$ (the inverse of $3$ modulo $20$ is $7$ because $3*7=21\\equiv 1\\pmod{20}$), we get $x\\equiv -28\\pmod{20}$. Simplifying, $x\\equiv -8\\pmod{20}$ or $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$.\n\n## Step 3: Now, we need to find a common solution for x from both congruences.\nFrom Step 1, we have $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$, which means $x$ can be represented as $x = 5k + 2$ for some integer $k$. From Step 2, $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$.\n## Step 4: We check which of the solutions from Step 2 satisfy the condition from Step 1.\nSince $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$ also satisfies $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$ (because $12\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$), $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$ is a common solution.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$ using the common solution.\nGiven $x\\equiv 12\\pmod{20}$, we compute $x^2 \\pmod{20}$. So, $x^2 \\equiv 12^2 \\pmod{20}$.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the calculation of $12^2$ and find its remainder when divided by $20$.\n$12^2 = 144$. Now, we find $144 \\pmod{20}$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate $144 \\pmod{20}$.\n$144 \\div 20 = 7$ with a remainder of $4$. Thus, $144 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{20}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
