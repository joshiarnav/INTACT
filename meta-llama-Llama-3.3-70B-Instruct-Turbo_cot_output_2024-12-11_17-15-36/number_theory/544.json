    "problem": "When Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 5, she has 3 remaining, and when she divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 remaining. If Claire has fewer than 60 cupcakes, what is the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that she could have?",
    "solution": "If Claire has $N$ cupcakes, we know that $N = 5x+3$ and $N = 7y+4$ for some integers $x$ and $y$. Equating these two forms of $N$, we have $7y+1=5x$. We also know that $N<60$. We can write out all the sufficiently small possible values of $7y+1$: $$1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57.$$Of these, the numbers that are also of the form $5x$ are $15$ and $50$. These correspond to solutions $N=18,$ $N=53$. Thus, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes is $53+18 = \\boxed{71}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the conditions\nClaire has cupcakes that when divided by 5 leave a remainder of 3, and when divided by 7 leave a remainder of 4. We need to find all possible quantities of cupcakes she could have under 60.\n\n## Step 2: Establish the equations based on the conditions\nLet x be the total number of cupcakes Claire has. Then the conditions can be expressed as:\n- x \u2261 3 (mod 5)\n- x \u2261 4 (mod 7)\n\n## Step 3: Solve the first congruence\nFor x \u2261 3 (mod 5), the numbers that satisfy this condition are in the form of x = 5n + 3, where n is an integer.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the second congruence\nFor x \u2261 4 (mod 7), the numbers that satisfy this condition are in the form of x = 7m + 4, where m is an integer.\n\n## Step 5: Find the common solution for both conditions\nWe need to find values of n and m such that 5n + 3 = 7m + 4. Rearranging the equation gives us 5n - 7m = 1. This is a linear Diophantine equation.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the Diophantine equation\nTo solve 5n - 7m = 1, we can use the method of finding a particular solution and then the general solution. A particular solution can be found by inspection or trial and error. One particular solution is n = 3 and m = 2, because 5*3 - 7*2 = 15 - 14 = 1.\n\n## Step 7: General solution for n and m\nThe general solution for n and m, given a particular solution (n', m'), is n = n' + 7k and m = m' + 5k, where k is an integer. Substituting the particular solution (3, 2) gives n = 3 + 7k and m = 2 + 5k.\n\n## Step 8: Express x in terms of k\nSubstituting n = 3 + 7k into x = 5n + 3 gives x = 5(3 + 7k) + 3 = 15 + 35k + 3 = 18 + 35k.\n\n## Step 9: Find all possible values of x under 60\nWe need to find integer values of k that make x = 18 + 35k less than 60. Since 18 + 35k < 60, 35k < 42. This means k can only be 0 or 1 because when k = 2, 35*2 = 70 which is greater than 42.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate x for k = 0 and k = 1\nFor k = 0, x = 18 + 35*0 = 18.\nFor k = 1, x = 18 + 35*1 = 53.\n\n## Step 11: Sum all possible quantities of cupcakes\nThe sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes Claire could have is 18 + 53 = 71.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{71}$"
