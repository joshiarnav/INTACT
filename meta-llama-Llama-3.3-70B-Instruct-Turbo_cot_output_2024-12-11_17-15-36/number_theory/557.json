    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the pattern of units digits for powers of 5.\nTo find the units digit of $5^4$, we should first observe the pattern of units digits for powers of 5. The units digit of $5^1$ is 5.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the units digit for higher powers of 5 to identify a pattern.\nFor $5^2 = 25$, the units digit is 5. This pattern continues because when you multiply 5 by itself, the units digit remains 5 due to the multiplication properties (5 * 5 = 25, and the units digit of 25 is 5).\n\n## Step 3: Apply the observed pattern to $5^4$.\nSince the pattern shows that any power of 5 will have a units digit of 5, we can conclude that the units digit of $5^4$ will also be 5 without needing to calculate the full value of $5^4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
