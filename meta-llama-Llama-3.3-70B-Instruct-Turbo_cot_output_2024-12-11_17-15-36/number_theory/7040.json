    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nTo find the largest 7-10 double, we need to understand what a 7-10 double is. A positive integer $N$ is called a 7-10 double if, when $N$ is represented in base-7 and the digits of that representation are read as if they were in base-10, the resulting base-10 number is twice the value of $N$.\n\n## Step 2: Establish the base-7 to base-10 conversion process\nLet's denote $N$ in base-7 as $a_na_{n-1}...a_0$, where each $a_i$ is a digit in base-7. The value of $N$ in base-10 can be calculated as $N = a_0 \\cdot 7^0 + a_1 \\cdot 7^1 + ... + a_n \\cdot 7^n$. The same digits read in base-10 give us a number $M = a_0 \\cdot 10^0 + a_1 \\cdot 10^1 + ... + a_n \\cdot 10^n$. According to the problem, $M = 2N$.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate the equation based on the given condition\nSubstituting the expressions for $N$ and $M$ into the equation $M = 2N$, we get $a_0 \\cdot 10^0 + a_1 \\cdot 10^1 + ... + a_n \\cdot 10^n = 2(a_0 \\cdot 7^0 + a_1 \\cdot 7^1 + ... + a_n \\cdot 7^n)$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation\nThis equation can be simplified to $a_0 + 10a_1 + ... + 10^na_n = 2(a_0 + 7a_1 + ... + 7^na_n)$, which can be further rearranged to $a_0 + 10a_1 + ... + 10^na_n - 2a_0 - 14a_1 - ... - 2 \\cdot 7^na_n = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Rearrange and simplify the equation to find a pattern\nRearranging gives $-a_0 + (10-14)a_1 + ... + (10^n - 2 \\cdot 7^n)a_n = 0$, which simplifies to $-a_0 - 4a_1 + ... + (10^n - 2 \\cdot 7^n)a_n = 0$. This equation helps in understanding how the digits in base-7 contribute to the condition of being a 7-10 double.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the limitations and possible values for $a_i$\nEach $a_i$ is a digit in base-7, so $0 \\leq a_i \\leq 6$. The equation derived must be solved with these constraints in mind, looking for the largest possible $N$ that satisfies the condition.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the potential for large numbers\nGiven that $10^n - 2 \\cdot 7^n$ will eventually become negative as $n$ increases (because $7^2 = 49 > 10^2 = 100$ and the difference in growth rates between $10^n$ and $7^n$), there's a limit to how large $N$ can be.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for the largest possible $N$\nWe need to solve the equation $-a_0 - 4a_1 + ... + (10^n - 2 \\cdot 7^n)a_n = 0$ with the constraints on $a_i$ and considering the growth rates of $10^n$ and $7^n$. Given the complexity of directly solving this equation for all $n$, it's practical to consider small values of $n$ and manually check for larger values of $N$.\n\n## Step 9: Consider a strategic approach to finding $N$\nGiven the constraints and the nature of the problem, a strategic approach involves starting with the highest possible values for $a_i$ and working downwards, keeping in mind the base-7 to base-10 conversion and the doubling condition.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate potential candidates for the largest 7-10 double\nOne approach is to start with a high value of $n$ and systematically decrease it, evaluating potential candidates for $N$ based on the condition that the base-10 representation of its base-7 digits is twice $N$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{315}$"
