    "solution": "Observe $A_n = a(1 + 10 + \\dots + 10^{n - 1}) = a \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$; similarly $B_n = b \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ and $C_n = c \\cdot \\tfrac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}$. The relation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$ rewrites as\\[c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = a^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\right)^2.\\]Since $n > 0$, $10^n > 1$ and we may cancel out a factor of $\\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ to obtain\\[c \\cdot (10^n + 1) - b = a^2 \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}.\\]This is a linear equation in $10^n$. Thus, if two distinct values of $n$ satisfy it, then all values of $n$ will. Now we plug in $n=0$ and $n=1$ (or some other number), we get $2c - b = 0$ and $11c - b= a^2$ . Solving the equations for $c$ and $b$, we get\\[c = \\frac{a^2}{9} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c - b = -\\frac{a^2}{9} \\implies b = \\frac{2a^2}{9}.\\]To maximize $a + b + c = a + \\tfrac{a^2}{3}$, we need to maximize $a$. Since $b$ and $c$ must be integers, $a$ must be a multiple of $3$. If $a = 9$ then $b$ exceeds $9$. However, if $a = 6$ then $b = 8$ and $c = 4$ for an answer of $\\boxed{18}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nWe need to find the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$ for which there are at least two values of $n$ such that $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$, where $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$ are integers with $n$ digits (or $2n$ digits for $C_n$) composed entirely of digits $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Express $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$ in terms of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $n$\n$A_n$ can be expressed as $A_n = a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}$, $B_n$ can be expressed as $B_n = b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}$, and $C_n$ can be expressed as $C_n = c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}$.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute these expressions into the equation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$\nBy substituting, we get $c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = \\left(a \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\right)^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying yields $c \\cdot (10^{2n} - 1) - b \\cdot (10^n - 1) = a^2 \\cdot (10^n - 1)^2 / 9$.\n\n## Step 5: Rearrange the equation to make it easier to analyze\nThis can be rearranged into a form that highlights the relationship between the coefficients $a$, $b$, $c$, and the powers of $10$, but given the complexity, let's consider the relationship in a more conceptual manner.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the constraints on $a$, $b$, and $c$\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonzero digits, they range from 1 to 9. The greatest possible sum $a + b + c$ would be achieved by maximizing these values while still satisfying the equation for at least two values of $n$.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the equation for large $n$\nFor very large $n$, the terms with the highest powers of $10$ dominate. Thus, $c \\cdot 10^{2n}$ needs to be close to $a^2 \\cdot 10^{2n} / 9$ to satisfy the equation, suggesting $9c \\approx a^2$.\n\n## Step 8: Consider possible values for $a$ and $c$ that satisfy $9c \\approx a^2$\nThe largest possible $a$ that could satisfy this with $c$ also being a single digit is $a = 9$ (since $9^2 = 81$ and $9c$ cannot exceed $9 \\times 9 = 81$), which would imply $c = 9$.\n\n## Step 9: With $a = 9$ and $c = 9$, consider the implications for $b$\nSubstituting $a = 9$ and $c = 9$ back into the original equation or its simplified form to find a suitable $b$ that makes the equation hold for at least two values of $n$.\n\n## Step 10: Recognize the need for a systematic approach to solve for $b$\nGiven $a = 9$ and $c = 9$, we'd solve $9 \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = \\left(9 \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\right)^2$ for $b$.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify with $a = 9$ and $c = 9$\nThis simplifies to $10^{2n} - 1 - b(10^n - 1) = (10^n - 1)^2$, which further simplifies to $10^{2n} - 1 - b \\cdot 10^n + b = 10^{2n} - 2 \\cdot 10^n + 1$.\n\n## Step 12: Solve for $b$\nBy comparing coefficients, $-b \\cdot 10^n + b = -2 \\cdot 10^n + 2$, implying $b = 2$ for the equation to balance in terms of $10^n$.\n\n## Step 13: Verify the solution\nWith $a = 9$, $b = 2$, and $c = 9$, verify that there are indeed at least two values of $n$ for which the original equation holds true.\n\n## Step 14: Calculate the sum $a + b + c$\nFinally, calculate $a + b + c = 9 + 2 + 9$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$"
