    "solution": "The units digit of $mn$ is $1^6 = 1$.  Searching for a units digit for $n$ (which is clearly odd), we find that $7 \\cdot 3 = 1$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit of $n$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify what is given and what needs to be found.\nWe are given that the product of $m$ and $n$ equals $21^6$, and the units digit of $m$ is 7. We need to find the units digit of $n$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the units digit of $21^6$.\nTo find the units digit of $21^6$, we only need to consider the units digit of $1^6$ because the units digit of $21$ is $1$. Since $1$ raised to any power is $1$, the units digit of $21^6$ is $1$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the information about the units digit of $m$ to find the units digit of $n$.\nThe units digit of $m$ is given as 7. When multiplied by $n$, the product has a units digit of $1$ (from $21^6$). We need to find a number (units digit of $n$) that when multiplied by 7 gives a units digit of 1.\n\n## Step 4: Determine which number multiplied by 7 gives a units digit of 1.\nWe examine the possible units digits of $n$ (0 through 9) to see which one, when multiplied by 7, results in a units digit of 1. The multiplication of 7 by each possible digit is as follows:\n- $7 \\times 0 = 0$\n- $7 \\times 1 = 7$\n- $7 \\times 2 = 14$\n- $7 \\times 3 = 21$\n- $7 \\times 4 = 28$\n- $7 \\times 5 = 35$\n- $7 \\times 6 = 42$\n- $7 \\times 7 = 49$\n- $7 \\times 8 = 56$\n- $7 \\times 9 = 63$\nFrom these, $7 \\times 3 = 21$ has a units digit of 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"
