    "problem": "There is a committee composed of eight women and two men. When they meet, they sit in a row---the women in indistinguishable rocking chairs and the men on indistinguishable stools.  How many distinct ways are there for me to arrange the eight chairs and two stools for a meeting?",
    "solution": "Because the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from each other and the stools are indistinguishable from each other, we can think of first placing the two stools somewhere in the ten slots and then filling the rest with rocking chairs. The first stool has $10$ slots in which it can go, and the second has $9$. However, because they are indistinguishable from each other, we have overcounted the number of ways to place the stools by a factor of $2$, so we divide by $2$. Thus, there are $\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = \\boxed{45}$ distinct ways to arrange the ten chairs and stools for a meeting.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the type of problem\nThis is a combination problem, where we need to find the number of distinct ways to arrange the ten seats, with eight of them being indistinguishable rocking chairs and two being indistinguishable stools.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the formula for solving the problem\nThe formula to solve this type of problem is given by the combination formula for indistinguishable objects, which is: $\\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!...n_k!}$, where $n$ is the total number of objects, and $n_1, n_2,...,n_k$ are the numbers of each type of indistinguishable object.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the formula to the given problem\nIn this problem, we have $n = 10$ (total number of seats), $n_1 = 8$ (number of indistinguishable rocking chairs), and $n_2 = 2$ (number of indistinguishable stools). So, the formula becomes: $\\frac{10!}{8!2!}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the value\nNow, we calculate the value of $\\frac{10!}{8!2!}$. First, simplify the factorials: $\\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}{8! \\times 2 \\times 1}$. Cancel out the $8!$ in the numerator and denominator, resulting in: $\\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression\nSimplify the expression: $\\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{45}$"
