    "problem": "The number 74 can be factored as 2(37), so 74 is said to have two distinct prime factors. How many distinct prime factors does 210 have?",
    "solution": "We know that $210 = 10 \\cdot 21$. Breaking down these factors even further, we have that $10 = 2 \\cdot 5$ and $21 = 3 \\cdot 7$, so $210 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. Since these factors are all prime, $210$ has $\\boxed{4}$ distinct prime factors.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the concept of distinct prime factors\nTo find the number of distinct prime factors of a number, we first need to factorize the number into its prime factors and then count how many unique primes are present.\n\n## Step 2: Factorize 210 into its prime factors\nThe prime factorization of 210 is the process of finding the prime numbers that multiply together to make 210. Let's start by dividing 210 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n\n## Step 3: Begin the factorization\n210 divided by 2 equals 105. Now, we look at 105 and find the next prime number that can divide it. 105 can be divided by 3 (since 105 = 3 * 35), and then 35 can be further divided by 5 and 7, because 35 = 5 * 7.\n\n## Step 4: List the prime factors of 210\nFrom the factorization, we have 210 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7. These are all prime numbers.\n\n## Step 5: Count the distinct prime factors\nLooking at the prime factors of 210 (2, 3, 5, 7), we count how many distinct primes there are. Each number is unique, so we count them: 1 (for 2), 2 (for 3), 3 (for 5), and 4 (for 7).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
