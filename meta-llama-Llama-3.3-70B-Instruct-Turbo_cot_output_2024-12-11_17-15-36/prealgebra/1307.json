Given \\(z = 60\\), we can calculate \\(y\\) as follows:\n\\[y = \\frac{1}{5} \\times z = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 60 = 12\\]\n\n2. **Value of \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\):** We know that the value of \\(x\\) is one-half the value of \\(y\\). Now that we have \\(y = 12\\), we can calculate \\(x\\) as follows:\n\\[x = \\frac{1}{2} \\times y = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(x\\) is \\(6\\).\n\n\\boxed{6}"
