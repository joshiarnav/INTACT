    "problem": "How many integers between 1 and 200 are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7?",
    "solution": "Integers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 must be multiples of 15.  We can start by listing the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200: $$15,30,45,60,75,90,105,120,135,150,165,180,195$$ Checking only the even numbers, we can eliminate those that are multiples of 4, leaving us with: $$15,30,45,75,90,105,135,150,165,195$$ Finally, we need to eliminate any remaining multiples of 7.  The only multiples of 7 we need to be concerned with are those ending in 5 or 0.  The only number on the list that is a multiple of 7 is 105.  Our final list is: $$15,30,45,75,90,135,150,165,195$$ This leaves us with $\\boxed{9}$ integers.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5\nTo find the integers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, we first need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5. The LCM of 3 and 5 is 15.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of multiples of 15 between 1 and 200\nNext, we need to find how many multiples of 15 are there between 1 and 200. We can do this by dividing 200 by 15 and taking the floor of the result, which gives us the number of multiples of 15 in the range. 200 / 15 = 13.333, so the floor of this is 13.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 4\nNow, we need to identify the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 4, so we can exclude them. The LCM of 15 and 4 is 60. The multiples of 60 between 1 and 200 are 60, 120, and 180. There are 3 such multiples.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 7\nWe also need to identify the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 7, so we can exclude them. The LCM of 15 and 7 is 105. The only multiple of 105 between 1 and 200 is 105. There is 1 such multiple.\n\n## Step 5: Check for overlap between multiples of 60 and 105\nTo ensure we don't double-count exclusions, we need to check if there's any overlap between the multiples of 60 and 105. The LCM of 60 and 105 is 420, which is greater than 200. This means there are no numbers between 1 and 200 that are multiples of both 60 and 105, so there's no overlap.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the final count of integers that meet the criteria\nFinally, we subtract the number of multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 4 or 7 from the total number of multiples of 15. total_multiples = 13, multiples_of_4_or_7 = 3 + 1 = 4. So, the final count is total_multiples - multiples_of_4_or_7 = 13 - 4 = 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$"
