    "problem": "A 12-slice pizza was made with only pepperoni and mushroom toppings, and every slice has at least one topping. Only six slices have pepperoni, and exactly ten slices have mushrooms. How many slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms?",
    "solution": "There are 12 total slices, and 6 of them have pepperoni and 10 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number of the slices that have both toppings, so there are $6-n$ with just pepperoni and $10-n$ with just mushrooms.  Since every slice has at least one topping, and there are 12 slices, we must have $(6-n) + (10-n) + n = 12$, which gives $n=\\boxed{4}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Identify the total number of slices and the number of slices with each topping.\nThe pizza has 12 slices in total. There are 6 slices with pepperoni and 10 slices with mushrooms.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize that some slices must have! both toppings since the total number of slices with either pepperoni or mushroom exceeds the total number of slices.\nGiven that every slice has at least one topping, and there are more slices with mushrooms than without, we can infer that some slices must contain both pepperoni and mushrooms to account for the difference.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of slices with both toppings.\nThe principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for two sets A and B, the size of the union of the two sets is equal to the sum of their sizes minus the size of their intersection. In this context, let's denote P as the set of slices with pepperoni and M as the set of slices with mushrooms. We know that |P| = 6 and |M| = 10. Since every slice has at least one topping, the union of P and M is the total number of slices, which is 12. Thus, we can set up the equation: |P \u222a M| = |P| + |M| - |P \u2229 M|, where |P \u222a M| = 12 (since all slices have a topping), |P| = 6, and |M| = 10.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for the number of slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms.\nSubstitute the known values into the equation: 12 = 6 + 10 - |P \u2229 M|. Simplify the equation to find |P \u2229 M|: 12 = 16 - |P \u2229 M|, which rearranges to |P \u2229 M| = 16 - 12.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the final answer.\n|P \u2229 M| = 4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
