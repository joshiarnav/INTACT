    "problem": "Angela has $a$ marbles, Brian has twice as many marbles as Angela, Caden has three times as many marbles as Brian, and Daryl has five times the number of marbles Caden has. If in total Angela, Brian, Caden and Daryl have 78 marbles, what is the value of $a?$",
    "solution": "First, quantify the number of marbles each person has:\n\n$\\bullet$ Angela has $a$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Brian has $2\\times a$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Caden has $3\\times(2\\times a)$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Daryl has $5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))$ marbles.\n\nIn total, the four people have $a+2\\times a+3\\times(2\\times a)+5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))$ marbles. And that expression equals 78, since in total the four people have 78 marbles. Now evaluate the resulting equation. \\begin{align*}\n78&=a+2\\times a+3\\times(2\\times a)+5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))\\\\\n&=a+2a+3(2a)+5(3(2a))\\\\\n&=a+2a+6a+5(6a)\\\\\n&=a+2a+6a+30a\\\\\n&=39a \\quad\\implies\\\\\na&=\\boxed{2}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.\nAngela has $a$ marbles, Brian has $2a$ marbles, Caden has $3 \\times 2a = 6a$ marbles, and Daryl has $5 \\times 6a = 30a$ marbles.\n\n## Step 2: Express the total number of marbles in terms of $a$.\nThe total number of marbles Angela, Brian, Caden, and Daryl have is $a + 2a + 6a + 30a = 39a$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up an equation based on the given total number of marbles.\nSince the total number of marbles is 78, we have $39a = 78$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for $a$.\nDivide both sides of the equation by 39 to solve for $a$: $a = \\frac{78}{39}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the fraction to find the value of $a$.\nSimplifying the fraction gives $a = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"
