    "model_solution": "To find $\\frac{~\\frac{2}{5}~}{\\frac{3}{7}}$, we need to follow the division rule for fractions. The division of two fractions is equivalent to multiplying the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.\n\nSo, $\\frac{~\\frac{2}{5}~}{\\frac{3}{7}} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{7}{3}$.\n\nNow, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together: $\\frac{2 \\times 7}{5 \\times 3}$.\n\nThis simplifies to $\\frac{14}{15}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{14}{15}}$."
