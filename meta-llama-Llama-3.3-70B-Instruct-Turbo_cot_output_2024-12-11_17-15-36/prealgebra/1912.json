    "solution": "Since the arithmetic mean of these expressions is 24, we can write the expression for the mean: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{(x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)}{5}&=24\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad (x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)&=5\\cdot 24\n\\end{align*}\n\nCombining like terms on the left, we find $5x+40=120$, so $5x=80$, from which we have $x=16$. Our final answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: The arithmetic mean is calculated by summing all the values and then dividing by the number of values. In this case, we have five expressions, and their mean is given as 24.\nTo find the sum of these expressions, we multiply the mean by the number of expressions: $24 \\times 5 = 120$.\n\n## Step 2: Now, let's add up the given expressions and set them equal to the sum calculated from the mean.\nThe sum of the expressions is $(x + 8) + 15 + 2x + 13 + (2x + 4)$.\nCombining like terms, we get $x + 2x + 2x + 8 + 15 + 13 + 4 = 5x + 40$.\n\n## Step 3: Since the mean of these expressions is 24, their sum must equal 120 (as found in step 1).\nSo, we set the sum of the expressions equal to 120: $5x + 40 = 120$.\n\n## Step 4: Now, we solve for $x$.\nSubtract 40 from both sides: $5x = 80$.\nDivide both sides by 5: $x = 16$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$"
