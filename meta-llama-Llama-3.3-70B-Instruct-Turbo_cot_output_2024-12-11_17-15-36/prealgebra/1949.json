    "problem": "What is the smallest positive number that is prime and $10$ less than a perfect square?",
    "solution": "A number 10 less than an even perfect square cannot be prime, so let's check odd perfect squares greater than 10:\n\n$\\bullet$ $5^2=25,$ $25-10=15,$ composite.\n\n$\\bullet$ $7^2=49,$ $49-10=39,$ composite.\n\n$\\bullet$ $9^2=81,$ $81-10=71.$\n\nChecking prime numbers up to $7$ $($the  largest prime less than $\\sqrt{71})$ as potential divisors, we  see that $71$ is prime. Thus, the smallest prime that is $10$ less  than a perfect square is $\\boxed{71}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand what the problem is asking for\nWe need to find the smallest positive number that satisfies two conditions: it must be a prime number and it must be 10 less than a perfect square.\n\n## Step 2: Establish the conditions mathematically\nLet's denote the number as $n$. For $n$ to be 10 less than a perfect square, we can write it as $n = k^2 - 10$, where $k$ is an integer. Additionally, $n$ must be a prime number.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the properties of prime numbers and perfect squares\nPrime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Perfect squares are numbers that can be expressed as the square of an integer. We need to find a perfect square such that when we subtract 10 from it, the result is a prime number.\n\n## Step 4: Start testing with the smallest possible values for $k$\nWe start with $k = 1$, but $1^2 - 10 = -9$, which is not a positive number, so we move to larger values of $k$. For $k = 2$, $2^2 - 10 = -6$, still not positive. For $k = 3$, $3^2 - 10 = 9 - 10 = -1$, which is also not positive. For $k = 4$, $4^2 - 10 = 16 - 10 = 6$, which is positive but not a prime number.\n\n## Step 5: Continue testing with larger values of $k$\nFor $k = 5$, $5^2 - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15$, which is not a prime number. For $k = 6$, $6^2 - 10 = 36 - 10 = 26$, which is also not a prime number. For $k = 7$, $7^2 - 10 = 49 - 10 = 39$, still not a prime number. For $k = 8$, $8^2 - 10 = 64 - 10 = 54$, which is not a prime number.\n\n## Step 6: Test $k = 9$\nFor $k = 9$, $9^2 - 10 = 81 - 10 = 71$. Now, 71 is indeed a prime number.\n\n## Step 7: Confirm that 71 meets all the criteria\n71 is a positive number, it is prime, and it is 10 less than a perfect square ($9^2 = 81$).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{71}$"
