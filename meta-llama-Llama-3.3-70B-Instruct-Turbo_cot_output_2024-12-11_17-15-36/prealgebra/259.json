    "problem": "A toy store manager received a large order of Mr. Slinkums just in time for the holidays. The manager places $20\\%$ of them on the shelves, leaving the other 120 Mr. Slinkums in storage. How many Mr. Slinkums were in this order?",
    "solution": "If $20\\%$ of the toys were put on the shelves, the $80\\%$ of the toys were left in storage.  Therefore, we are given $80\\% T=120$, where $T$ is the number of toys in the order.  Rewriting $80\\%$ as $\\frac{4}{5}$ and multiplying both sides by $\\frac{5}{4}$, we find that $T=120\\cdot\\frac{5}{4}=30\\cdot 5=\\boxed{150}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Let's denote the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order as x.\nWe know that the manager places 20% of them on the shelves and leaves the other 120 Mr. Slinkums in storage.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the percentage of Mr. Slinkums left in storage.\nSince 20% were placed on the shelves, 100% - 20% = 80% of the Mr. Slinkums were left in storage.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation to find the total number of Mr. Slinkums.\n80% of x = 120, which can be written as 0.8x = 120.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for x.\nDivide both sides by 0.8 to find x: x = 120 / 0.8.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the value of x.\nx = 150.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{150}$"
