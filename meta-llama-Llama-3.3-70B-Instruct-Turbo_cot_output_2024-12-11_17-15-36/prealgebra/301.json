    "problem": "What is the greatest common factor of 68 and 92?",
    "solution": "$68=2^2\\cdot17$ and $92=2^2\\cdot23$. The only prime number that these two prime factorizations have in common is the number 2. If a number's prime factorization has a 2 raised to a power greater than 2, it will not be a factor of either of these numbers, so their GCF is $2^2=\\boxed{4}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: List the factors of 68\nTo find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 68 and 92, we first need to list all the factors of 68. The factors of 68 are: 1, 2, 4, 17, 34, and 68.\n\n## Step 2: List the factors of 92\nNext, we list all the factors of 92. The factors of 92 are: 1, 2, 4, 23, 46, and 92.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the common factors\nNow, we identify the factors that 68 and 92 have in common. From the lists, we can see that the common factors are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the greatest common factor\nThe greatest common factor (GCF) is the largest of the common factors identified. Among 1, 2, and 4, the largest is 4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
