    "problem": "What is the 20th digit after the decimal point of the sum of the decimal equivalents for the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$?",
    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$, and that of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $0.\\overline{3}$. The first has a repeating block of 6 digits and the second has a repeating block of 1 digit, so we believe the repeating block of the sum will have 6 digits and try adding the first 6 digits of each decimal representation.  $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}& & &. &1 & 4 & \\stackrel{1}{2} & 8 & \\stackrel{1}{5} & 7\\\\& +& &. &3 &3 & 3 & 3& 3 & 3\\\\ \\cline{1-9} & & & .& 4 &7 & 6 & 1 & 9 & 0\\\\ \\end{array} $$ Notice that continuing the addition past the first six digits will result in repeating blocks of the same six digits ($.142857+.333333=.476190$), so the decimal representation of the sum is $0.\\overline{476190}$. Since 20 divided by 6 has a remainder of 2, the 20th digit following the decimal point is the same as the second digit following the decimal point, which is $\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Convert the fractions to decimals\nTo find the decimal equivalents of the fractions $\\frac{1}{7}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, we perform long division. $\\frac{1}{7}$ as a decimal is $0.\\overline{142857}$, which has a repeating cycle of 6 digits. $\\frac{1}{3}$ as a decimal is $0.\\overline{3}$, which has a repeating cycle of 1 digit.\n\n## Step 2: Sum the decimals\nThe sum of $0.\\overline{142857}$ and $0.\\overline{3}$ can be found by adding the repeating parts together. Since $0.\\overline{3}$ can be considered as $0.\\overline{333333}$ to match the length of the repeating cycle of $\\frac{1}{7}$, the sum of the repeating parts is $142857 + 333333 = 476190$. Therefore, the sum of the decimals is $0.\\overline{476190}$.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the 20th digit after the decimal point\nGiven that the repeating cycle of the sum is 6 digits long (476190), to find the 20th digit after the decimal point, we need to see where the 20th digit falls within this cycle. Since 20 divided by 6 has a remainder of 2, the 20th digit will be the same as the 2nd digit in the repeating cycle.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the 2nd digit in the repeating cycle\nThe repeating cycle is 476190. The 2nd digit in this cycle is 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"
