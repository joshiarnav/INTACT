    "problem": "In a history class, the probability of earning an A is .7 times the probability of earning a B, and the probability of earning a C is 1.4 times the probability of earning a B. Assuming that all grades are A, B, or C, how many B's will there be in a history class of 31 students?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of students who earn a B. Then we know that the number of students who get an A is $.7x$ and the number of students who earn a C is $1.4x$. Since every student in the class gets an A, B, or C and there are 31 students, this gives us the equation $.7x + x + 1.4x = 31 \\Rightarrow 3.1x = 31 \\Rightarrow x =\\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the probabilities of earning grades A, B, and C.\nLet's denote the probability of earning an A as P(A), the probability of earning a B as P(B), and the probability of earning a C as P(C). We are given that P(A) = 0.7 * P(B) and P(C) = 1.4 * P(B).\n\n## Step 2: Establish the relationship between the probabilities of A, B, and C.\nSince all grades are A, B, or C, the sum of their probabilities must equal 1. Therefore, P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the given relationships into the equation from Step 2.\nSubstituting P(A) = 0.7 * P(B) and P(C) = 1.4 * P(B) into the equation P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1, we get 0.7 * P(B) + P(B) + 1.4 * P(B) = 1.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for P(B).\nCombining like terms in the equation 0.7 * P(B) + P(B) + 1.4 * P(B) = 1 gives us 3.1 * P(B) = 1. Solving for P(B), we find P(B) = 1 / 3.1.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate P(B) as a decimal.\nP(B) = 1 / 3.1 \u2248 0.3226.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the expected number of B's in a class of 31 students.\nTo find the expected number of B's, we multiply the total number of students by the probability of earning a B. So, the expected number of B's = 31 * P(B) = 31 * 0.3226.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the expected number of B's.\nPerforming the multiplication gives us the expected number of B's \u2248 31 * 0.3226 \u2248 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$"
