    "problem": "We have a cube with 4 blue faces and 2 red faces.  What's the probability that when it is rolled, a blue face will be facing up?",
    "solution": "We have 6 equally likely outcomes, corresponding to the 6 faces of the cube.  4 of those 6 outcomes are successful ones (meaning a blue face is facing up).  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability of a blue face facing up when the cube is rolled, we need to consider the total number of faces and the number of blue faces.\n\n1. **Total number of faces**: A cube has 6 faces in total.\n\n2. **Number of blue faces**: We are given that 4 faces of the cube are blue.\n\n3. **Probability of a blue face facing up**: The probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (blue faces) by the total number of possible outcomes (total faces). So, the probability = number of blue faces / total number of faces = 4 / 6.\n\n4. **Simplifying the fraction**: The fraction 4/6 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. So, 4 / 6 simplifies to 2 / 3.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a blue face will be facing up when the cube is rolled is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$."
