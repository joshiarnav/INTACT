    "problem": "What is the sum of the prime factors of 91?",
    "solution": "Since 91 is not divisible by the first three prime numbers, we try dividing $91\\div 7$.  We find a quotient of 13, so $91=7\\times 13$ and the sum of these prime factors is $7+13=\\boxed{20}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand what a prime factor is\nA prime factor of a number is a prime number that can divide the number without leaving a remainder. To find the sum of the prime factors of 91, we first need to identify all the prime factors.\n\n## Step 2: Find the prime factors of 91\nTo find the prime factors, we start by dividing 91 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. However, 91 is an odd number, so 2 won't be a factor. We then move to the next prime number, which is 3. Since 91 is not divisible by 3, we move to the next prime number, 5, then 7, and so on, until we find a prime number that can divide 91.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the prime factors of 91\n91 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5. When we try 7, we find that 91 divided by 7 equals 13. Both 7 and 13 are prime numbers. So, the prime factors of 91 are 7 and 13.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of the prime factors\nNow that we have identified the prime factors of 91 as 7 and 13, we calculate their sum. sum = 7 + 13 = 20.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$"
