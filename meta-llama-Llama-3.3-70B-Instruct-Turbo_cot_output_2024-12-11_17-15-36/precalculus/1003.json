    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the key elements\nWe need to find the point in the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$ that is closest to the point $(1,2,3)$. The key elements are the equation of the plane and the coordinates of the given point.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the formula for the distance between a point and a plane\nThe distance $D$ from a point $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ to a plane $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0$ is given by the formula $D = \\frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + Cz_1 + D|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}}$. However, in this case, we are looking for the point on the plane that is closest to the given point, not the distance itself.\n\n## Step 3: Recognize that the closest point lies on the line perpendicular to the plane through the given point\nThe closest point to $(1,2,3)$ on the plane $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$ lies on the line that passes through $(1,2,3)$ and is perpendicular to the plane. The direction vector of this line is the normal vector of the plane, which is $\\vec{n} = (3, -4, 5)$.\n\n## Step 4: Parametrize the line perpendicular to the plane through the given point\nThe parametric equations of the line passing through $(1,2,3)$ with direction vector $\\vec{n} = (3, -4, 5)$ can be written as $x = 1 + 3t$, $y = 2 - 4t$, and $z = 3 + 5t$, where $t$ is a parameter.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane to find the point of intersection\nSubstitute $x = 1 + 3t$, $y = 2 - 4t$, and $z = 3 + 5t$ into the equation $3x - 4y + 5z = 30$ to find the value of $t$ at the point of intersection.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the substitution and solve for $t$\n$3(1 + 3t) - 4(2 - 4t) + 5(3 + 5t) = 30$\n\nExpanding gives:\n$3 + 9t - 8 + 16t + 15 + 25t = 30$\n\nCombine like terms:\n$50t + 10 = 30$\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n$50t = 20$\n\nDivide by 50:\n$t = \\frac{20}{50} = \\frac{2}{5}$\n\n## Step 7: Use the value of $t$ to find the coordinates of the closest point\nSubstitute $t = \\frac{2}{5}$ into the parametric equations $x = 1 + 3t$, $y = 2 - 4t$, and $z = 3 + 5t$.\n\n$x = 1 + 3(\\frac{2}{5}) = 1 + \\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{5}{5} + \\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{11}{5}$\n\n$y = 2 - 4(\\frac{2}{5}) = 2 - \\frac{8}{5} = \\frac{10}{5} - \\frac{8}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}$\n\n$z = 3 + 5(\\frac{2}{5}) = 3 + 2 = 5$\n\nThe closest point is $(\\frac{11}{5}, \\frac{2}{5}, 5)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(\\frac{11}{5}, \\frac{2}{5}, 5)}$"
