    "solution": "Since the point lies in the $xz$-plane, it is of the form $(x,0,z).$  We want this point to be equidistant to the points $(1,-1,0),$ $(2,1,2),$ and $(3,2,-1),$ which gives us the equations\n\\begin{align*}\n(x - 1)^2 + 1^2 + z^2 &= (x - 2)^2 + 1^2 + (z - 2)^2, \\\\\n(x - 1)^2 + 1^2 + z^2 &= (x - 3)^2 + 2^2 + (z + 1)^2.\n\\end{align*}These equations simplify to $2x + 4z = 7$ and $4x - 2z = 12.$  Solving these equation, we find $x = \\frac{31}{10}$ and $z = \\frac{1}{5},$ so the point we seek is $\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{31}{10}, 0, \\frac{1}{5} \\right)}.$",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Define the point in the xz-plane\nLet the point in the $xz$-plane be $(x, 0, z)$ since any point in the $xz$-plane has a $y$-coordinate of 0.\n\n## Step 2: Set up the equations for equidistant points\nThe distance $d$ between two points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ in 3D space is given by the formula $d = \\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 + (z_2-z_1)^2}$. We will use this formula to set up equations for the distances between $(x, 0, z)$ and each of the given points.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the distance to the first point\nThe distance $d_1$ from $(x, 0, z)$ to $(1, -1, 0)$ is $d_1 = \\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (0-(-1))^2 + (z-0)^2} = \\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + 1 + z^2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the distance to the second point\nThe distance $d_2$ from $(x, 0, z)$ to $(2, 1, 2)$ is $d_2 = \\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + (0-1)^2 + (z-2)^2} = \\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + 1 + (z-2)^2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the distance to the third point\nThe distance $d_3$ from $(x, 0, z)$ to $(3, 2, -1)$ is $d_3 = \\sqrt{(x-3)^2 + (0-2)^2 + (z-(-1))^2} = \\sqrt{(x-3)^2 + 4 + (z+1)^2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Set up the equations for equidistance\nSince the point $(x, 0, z)$ is equidistant from the three given points, we have $d_1 = d_2$ and $d_1 = d_3$. Setting up the equations:\n1. $(x-1)^2 + 1 + z^2 = (x-2)^2 + 1 + (z-2)^2$\n2. $(x-1)^2 + 1 + z^2 = (x-3)^2 + 4 + (z+1)^2$\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the first equation\nExpanding the first equation:\n$x^2 - 2x + 1 + 1 + z^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 + 1 + z^2 - 4z + 4$\nSimplifying:\n$-2x + 2 = -4x + 9 - 4z$\nFurther simplification gives:\n$2x + 4z = 7$\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the second equation\nExpanding the second equation:\n$x^2 - 2x + 1 + 1 + z^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9 + 4 + z^2 + 2z + 1$\nSimplifying:\n$-2x + 2 = -6x + 14 + 2z$\nFurther simplification gives:\n$4x - 2z = 12$\n\n## Step 9: Solve the system of equations\nWe have two equations:\n1. $2x + 4z = 7$\n2. $4x - 2z = 12$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations for $x$ and $z$.\n\n## Step 10: Solve for x and z\nFirst, let's simplify equation 2 to make the coefficients more manageable:\n$4x - 2z = 12$ can be divided by 2 to get $2x - z = 6$.\n\nNow, we have:\n1. $2x + 4z = 7$\n2. $2x - z = 6$\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives:\n$5z = 1$\n\nSo, $z = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nSubstitute $z = \\frac{1}{5}$ into the second equation:\n$2x - \\frac{1}{5} = 6$\n$2x = 6 + \\frac{1}{5}$\n$2x = \\frac{30}{5} + \\frac{1}{5}$\n$2x = \\frac{31}{5}$\n$x = \\frac{31}{10}$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(\\frac{31}{10}, 0, \\frac{1}{5})}$"
