    "model_solution": "## Step 1: To find the point $P$ such that $AP = BP = CP = DP$, we first denote $P$ as $(x,y,z)$.\nWe are looking for a point $P$ that is equidistant from points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n\n## Step 2: The distance formula between two points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ in 3D space is given by $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2 + (z_2-z_1)^2}$.\nWe can use this formula to set up equations for the distances $AP$, $BP$, $CP$, and $DP$.\n\n## Step 3: The distance $AP$ from $A(8,0,0)$ to $P(x,y,z)$ is $\\sqrt{(x-8)^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.\nThe distance $BP$ from $B(0,-4,0)$ to $P(x,y,z)$ is $\\sqrt{x^2 + (y+4)^2 + z^2}$.\nThe distance $CP$ from $C(0,0,6)$ to $P(x,y,z)$ is $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-6)^2}$.\nThe distance $DP$ from $D(0,0,0)$ to $P(x,y,z)$ is $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Since $AP = BP = CP = DP$, we can set these distances equal to each other to find the coordinates of $P$.\nSetting $AP = DP$ gives $\\sqrt{(x-8)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.\nSetting $BP = DP$ gives $\\sqrt{x^2 + (y+4)^2 + z^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.\nSetting $CP = DP$ gives $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-6)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Squaring both sides of the equation $AP = DP$ to eliminate the square root yields $(x-8)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$.\nExpanding and simplifying gives $x^2 - 16x + 64 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$.\nThis simplifies further to $-16x + 64 = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Solving $-16x + 64 = 0$ for $x$ gives $-16x = -64$ or $x = 4$.\nSo, the $x$-coordinate of $P$ is $4$.\n\n## Step 7: Squaring both sides of the equation $BP = DP$ yields $x^2 + (y+4)^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$.\nExpanding and simplifying gives $x^2 + y^2 + 8y + 16 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$.\nThis simplifies further to $8y + 16 = 0$.\n\n## Step 8: Solving $8y + 16 = 0$ for $y$ gives $8y = -16$ or $y = -2$.\nSo, the $y$-coordinate of $P$ is $-2$.\n\n## Step 9: Squaring both sides of the equation $CP = DP$ yields $x^2 + y^2 + (z-6)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$.\nExpanding and simplifying gives $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 12z + 36 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$.\nThis simplifies further to $-12z + 36 = 0$.\n\n## Step 10: Solving $-12z + 36 = 0$ for $z$ gives $-12z = -36$ or $z = 3$.\nSo, the $z$-coordinate of $P$ is $3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(4, -2, 3)}$"
