    "model_solution": "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the operation to be performed\nTo compute the product of two matrices, we need to follow the rules of matrix multiplication. Given two matrices A and B, where A is a 2x2 matrix and B is a 2x2 matrix, the resulting matrix C will also be a 2x2 matrix. Each element of C is computed by taking the dot product of the rows of A with the columns of B.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the elements of the matrices\nMatrix A is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 5 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}$ and Matrix B is $\\begin{pmatrix} 8 & -2 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. We will multiply these two matrices to get the resulting matrix C.\n\n## Step 3: Compute the elements of the resulting matrix C\nTo find the element in the first row, first column of C (let's call it $c_{11}$), we multiply the first row of A by the first column of B: $(2)(8) + (0)(1) = 16 + 0 = 16$.\n\nTo find the element in the first row, second column of C (let's call it $c_{12}$), we multiply the first row of A by the second column of B: $(2)(-2) + (0)(1) = -4 + 0 = -4$.\n\nTo find the element in the second row, first column of C (let's call it $c_{21}$), we multiply the second row of A by the first column of B: $(5)(8) + (-3)(1) = 40 - 3 = 37$.\n\nTo find the element in the second row, second column of C (let's call it $c_{22}$), we multiply the second row of A by the second column of B: $(5)(-2) + (-3)(1) = -10 - 3 = -13$.\n\n## Step 4: Assemble the resulting matrix C\nAfter computing all the elements, the resulting matrix C is $\\begin{pmatrix} 16 & -4 \\\\ 37 & -13 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 16 & -4 \\\\ 37 & -13 \\end{pmatrix}}$"
