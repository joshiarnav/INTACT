    "solution": "Observe $A_n = a(1 + 10 + \\dots + 10^{n - 1}) = a \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$; similarly $B_n = b \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ and $C_n = c \\cdot \\tfrac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}$. The relation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$ rewrites as\\[c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = a^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\right)^2.\\]Since $n > 0$, $10^n > 1$ and we may cancel out a factor of $\\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ to obtain\\[c \\cdot (10^n + 1) - b = a^2 \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}.\\]This is a linear equation in $10^n$. Thus, if two distinct values of $n$ satisfy it, then all values of $n$ will. Now we plug in $n=0$ and $n=1$ (or some other number), we get $2c - b = 0$ and $11c - b= a^2$ . Solving the equations for $c$ and $b$, we get\\[c = \\frac{a^2}{9} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c - b = -\\frac{a^2}{9} \\implies b = \\frac{2a^2}{9}.\\]To maximize $a + b + c = a + \\tfrac{a^2}{3}$, we need to maximize $a$. Since $b$ and $c$ must be integers, $a$ must be a multiple of $3$. If $a = 9$ then $b$ exceeds $9$. However, if $a = 6$ then $b = 8$ and $c = 4$ for an answer of $\\boxed{18}$.",

    "model_solution": "## Step 1:  We are given a problem that asks us to find the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$ for which there are at least two values of $n$ such that $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$.\n## Step 2:  First, let's understand the problem by introducing some notation. Let $A_n$ be the $n$-digit integer each of whose digits is equal to $a$, $B_n$ be the $n$-digit integer each of whose digits is equal to $b$, and $C_n$ be the $2n$-digit integer each of whose digits is equal to $c$.\n## Step 3:  To approach this problem, we need to express $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$ in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$, and then use these expressions to derive the equation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$.\n## Step 4:  We can express $A_n$, $B_n$, and $C_n$ as follows: $A_n=a\\cdot\\frac{10^n-1}{9}$, $B_n=b\\cdot\\frac{10^n-1}{9}$, and $C_n=c\\cdot\\frac{10^{2n}-1}{9}$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we can substitute these expressions into the equation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$ and simplify to obtain the equation $c\\cdot\\frac{10^{2n}-1}{9} - b\\cdot\\frac{10^n-1}{9} = \\left(a\\cdot\\frac{10^n-1}{9}\\right)^2$.\n## Step 6:  After simplifying, we arrive at the equation $c\\cdot(10^n+1) - b = a^2(10^n-1)$.\n## Step 7:  We notice that the equation has to hold true for at least two values of $n$, so we need to consider the constraints on the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n## Step 8:  We can rewrite the equation as $a^2(10^n-1)=b-(c-10a-1)\\cdot10^n$.\n## Step 9:  This equation tells us that the left-hand side has a factor of $10^n-1$ which is divisible by $10^n$ if and only if $n=1$.\n## Step 10:  However, we also need to consider that the equation holds true for at least one other value of $n$.\n## Step 11:  This leads us to consider the equation $a^2(10-1)=b-(c-10a-1)\\cdot10$ when $n=1$.\n## Step 12:  By simplifying this equation, we find that $a^2=9c-8a-1$.\n## Step 13:  Since $a$ and $c$ are digits, we know that $a^2$ is at most 81, so we need to find the greatest possible value of $a$ such that the equation $a^2=9c-8a-1$ has solutions.\n## Step 14:  By iterating over possible values of $a$, we find that the greatest possible value of $a$ that satisfies the equation is $a=9$.\n## Step 15:  Substituting $a=9$ into the equation $a^2=9c-8a-1$, we find that $c=10$.\n## Step 16:  We then substitute $a=9$ and $c=10$ back into the equation $a^2(10-1)=b-(c-10a-1)\\cdot10$ to find the value of $b$.\n## Step 17:  After simplifying, we find that $b=9$.\n## Step 18:  Therefore, the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$ is $9 + 9 + 10 = 28$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$"
