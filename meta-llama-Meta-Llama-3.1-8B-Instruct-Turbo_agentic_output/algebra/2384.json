    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "From the information given, we have $x^2 = 2x + 48$. Rearranging, we get $x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$, which we can factor as $(x+6)(x-8) = 0$. Therefore, $x = -6\\text{ or }8$.  Since we want the lesser, $\\boxed{-6}$ is our answer.",

This is a quadratic equation that can be solved using factoring or the quadratic formula.\nTo solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a. In this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = -48. \n\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a((-2)^2 - 4(1)(-48))) / (2(1))\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a(4 + 192)) / 2\nx = (2 \u00b1 \u221a196) / 2\nx = (2 \u00b1 14) / 2\nNow, we have two possible solutions for 'x':\nx = (2 + 14) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8\nx = (2 - 14) / 2 = -12 / 2 = -6\nSince we are looking for the least integer, the solution is: $\\boxed{-6}$",
