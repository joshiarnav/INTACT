    "solution": "Substituting $f^{-1}(x)$ into our expression for $f$, we get \\[f(f^{-1}(x))=\\frac{16}{5+3f^{-1}(x)}.\\]Since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f^{-1}$, we have \\[x=\\frac{16}{5+3f^{-1}(x)}.\\]When $x=2$ this says \\[2=\\frac{16}{5+3f^{-1}(2)}.\\]Solving for $f^{-1}(2)$, we find $f^{-1}(2) = 1$.  Then $[f^{-1}(2)]^{-2} = 1^{-2} = \\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of $\\left[f^{-1}(2)\\right]^{-2}$, we need to find the inverse of the function $f(x)$ and then evaluate the inverse at $x=2$. \n\nStep 1: To find the inverse function, we will switch $x$ and $y$, and then solve for $y$ in the equation $x = \\frac{16}{5+3y}$.\nStep 2: Multiply both sides by $5+3y$ to get $x(5+3y)=16$. Then, expand the left side to get $5x+3xy=16$. Next, isolate the term with $y$ by subtracting $5x$ from both sides to get $3xy=16-5x$. Finally, solve for $y$ by dividing both sides by $3x$ to get $y=\\frac{16-5x}{3x}$.\nStep 3: Now that we have the inverse function $f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{16-5x}{3x}$, we can find $f^{-1}(2)$ by substituting $x=2$ into the inverse function, which gives $f^{-1}(2) = \\frac{16-5(2)}{3(2)}$.
