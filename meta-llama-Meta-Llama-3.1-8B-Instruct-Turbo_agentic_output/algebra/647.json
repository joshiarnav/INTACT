    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We will complete the square on the given quadratic expression to find the vertex. Factoring $-3$ from the first two terms, we have \\[y=-3(x^2+10x)-81\\]In order to make the expression inside the parentheses a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(10/2)^2=25$ inside the parentheses. Doing this, we get \\[y=-3(x^2+10x+25-25)-81 = -3(x+5)^2-6\\]The graph of an equation of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ is a parabola with vertex at $(h,k)$, so the vertex of our parabola is at $(-5,-6)$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{-6}$.",

First, we rewrite the equation by factoring out the coefficient of $x^2$: $y=-3(x^2+10x)-81$.\nNext, we add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of $x$ inside the parentheses, which is $(10/2)^2=25$: $y=-3(x^2+10x+25-25)-81$.\nNow, we simplify the expression: \n$y=-3(x^2+10x+25)-3\\cdot25-81$. \nThis simplifies to $y=-3(x+5)^2-108$. Since the vertex of the parabola is in the form $(h, k)$, we can see that the vertex of the parabola is $(-5, -108)$. Therefore, $n=\\boxed{-108}$.\nNow, we can directly read the value of $n$ from the vertex form of the equation, $y=-3(x+5)^2-108$, which is the value of $k$ in the vertex form $(h, k)$, confirming our previous conclusion that $n = -108$.\nSince we have already found the vertex of the parabola to be $(-5, -108)$, we can directly read the value of $n$ as $-108$.\nSince we have already found the vertex of the parabola to be $(-5, -108)$, the value of $n$ is directly $-108$.\nThe final step is to confirm that the value of $n$ is indeed $-108$ from the vertex form of the equation $(h, k)$.\nThe final step is to confirm that the value of $n$ is indeed $-108$ from the vertex form of the equation $(h, k)$.
