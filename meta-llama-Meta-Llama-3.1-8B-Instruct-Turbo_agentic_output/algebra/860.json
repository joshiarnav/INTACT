    "problem": "The equation $x^2+ ax = -14$ has only integer solutions for $x$. If $a$ is a positive integer, what is the greatest possible value of $a$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The left-hand side factors into $x(x+a)=-14$, so $x$ and $x+a$ both divide $-14$. One of the two factors is negative and the other positive, since their product is negative. $x+a>x$, so $x+a>0$ and $x<0$. This leaves 4 possibilities for $x$, since it is negative and divides $-14$ evenly: $-1$, $-2$, $-7$, and $-14$. $x=-1$ gives $x+a=14$ and therefore $a=15$. Similarly, $x=-2$, $x=-7$, and $x=-14$ give $a=9$, $a=9$, and $a=15$, respectively. The largest value for $a$ is thus $\\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "First step: \n\nWe can rewrite the given equation as $x^2 + ax + 14 = 0$. Since it has only integer solutions, we can apply the fact that the product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is equal to $c/a$. In this case, the product of the roots is $14$.\nSecond step: \n\nSince the product of the roots is $14$ and both roots are integers, the possible integer pairs $(r, s)$ that multiply to $14$ are $(1, 14)$, $(-1, -14)$, $(2, 7)$, $(-2, -7)$. We will use these pairs to find the corresponding values of $a$.\nThird step: \n\nSince $a$ is a positive integer and is equal to the sum of the roots in a quadratic equation $x^2 + bx + c = 0$, we will find the sum of each possible integer pair $(r, s)$ from the previous step. This will give us the possible values of $a$: \n\n- $1 + 14 = 15$\n- $-1 + (-14) = -15$\n- $2 + 7 = 9$\n- $-2 + (-7) = -9$\n\nSince $a$ is a positive integer, the only possible values of $a$ are $15$ and $9$.\nFourth step:\n\nSince we are looking for the greatest possible value of $a$ and we have found that $a$ can be either $15$ or $9$, the greatest possible value of $a$ is $\\boxed{15}$.",
