    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "In this set of integers, there are 5 tens digits: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.  If 5 integers all have different tens digits, then there must be exactly one integer among the 5 with each tens digit.  Since there are 10 different integers for each tens digit, the number of ways to pick, without regard to order, 5 different integers with different tens digits is $10^5$.  The total number of combinations of 5 integers is $\\binom{50}{5}$.  So the probability that 5 integers drawn all have the different tens digits is $$ \\frac{10^5}{\\binom{50}{5}} = \\frac{100000}{2118760} = \\boxed{\\frac{2500}{52969}}. $$",

    "model_solution": "To solve the problem, we first identify that the tens digits in the given range (20-69) are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. \n\nStep 1: Since there are 5 different tens digits and we are choosing 5 integers, we need to calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 integers from the given range. \n\nThe total number of integers in the range 20-69, inclusive, is 50. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose 5 integers from this range is given by the combination formula C(50, 5).\nStep 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 integers with different tens digits. This is equivalent to choosing one integer from each of the 5 tens digit groups (20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69). Within each group, there are 10 choices, so the total number of ways is $10^5 = 100,000$.\nStep 3: To find the probability that the 5 integers have different tens digits, we need to divide the number of favorable outcomes (calculated in Step 2) by the total number of outcomes (calculated in Step 1). The probability is then $\\frac{100,000}{C(50, 5)}$. To find the final probability, we need to calculate the value of C(50, 5). \n\nC(50, 5) is equal to $\\frac{50!}{5!(50-5)!} = \\frac{50!}{5!45!} = 2,118,760$. \n\nNow we can calculate the probability. The probability is then $\\frac{100,000}{2,118,760}$.\nStep 4: The probability of choosing 5 integers with different tens digits is $\\frac{100,000}{2,118,760}$. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 100. This gives us $\\frac{1000}{21,187.6}$. We can then further simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 1000, giving us $\\frac{1}{21.19}$.\nStep 5: The final probability of choosing 5 integers with different tens digits is $\\frac{1000}{21,187.6}$, or approximately $\\frac{1}{21.19}$.\nStep 6: Since the problem asks for the probability, we do not need to convert the fraction into a decimal, but instead, keep it as a simplified fraction. The greatest common divisor of 100000 and 2118760 is 100, and after simplifying, we get $\\frac{1000}{21188}$. We can then divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4, giving us $\\frac{250}{5297}$.\nStep 7: The simplified probability is $\\frac{250}{5297}$. To find the final answer, convert the fraction to a decimal. The decimal equivalent of $\\frac{250}{5297}$ is approximately $0.0472$.\nStep 8: Since the problem asks for the probability, the decimal form is not required. Therefore, the final probability of choosing 5 integers with different tens digits is $\\boxed{\\frac{250}{5297}}$.",
