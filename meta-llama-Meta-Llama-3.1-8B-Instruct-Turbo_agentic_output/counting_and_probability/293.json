    "problem": "William is taking the 25-question, multiple choice American Mathematics Competition. Each question has five answer choices. William guesses random answers for the last four questions. What is the probability that he will get at least one of these final four questions right?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We find the probability that William misses the last four questions, and subtract from 1. The probability of William missing a question is $\\frac{4}{5}$, so the probability that he misses all four is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = \\frac{256}{625}$. The probability that he gets at least one right is $1-\\frac{256}{625} =\\boxed{\\frac{369}{625}}$.",
    "is_solved": true,
    "model_solution": "Step 1: Determine the probability of getting each question wrong. Since each question has 5 answer choices and only one is correct, the probability of getting a question wrong is 4/5.\nStep 2: Since William is guessing random answers for the last four questions, we need to find the probability that he gets at least one question right. To do this, we'll first find the probability that he gets all four questions wrong (i.e., the complement event), and then subtract that from 1.\nStep 3: To find the probability that William gets all four questions wrong, we raise the probability of getting one question wrong (4/5) to the power of 4, since the questions are independent events. This gives us (4/5)^4 = 256/625.\nStep 4: To find the probability that William gets at least one question right, we subtract the probability that he gets all four questions wrong from 1. This gives us 1 - 256/625 = 369/625.\nStep 5: Since the probability of getting at least one question right has been found, the solution is complete. Therefore, the probability that William will get at least one of the final four questions right is $\\boxed{369/625}$.",
