    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We notice that the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's must equal the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's. So, we can find the probability that Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's, subtract it from 1, and divide by 2 to find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's. There are three ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's: he can roll two of each, one of each, or none of each. If he rolls two of each, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which two dice roll the 1's. If he rolls one of each, there are $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1}=12$ ways to choose which dice are the 6 and the 1, and for each of those ways there are $4\\cdot4=16$ ways to choose the values of the other dice. If Greg rolls no 1's or 6's, there are $4^4=256$ possible values for the dice. In total, there are $6+12\\cdot16+256=454$ ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's. There are $6^4=1296$ total ways the four dice can roll, so the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\left(1-\\dfrac{454}{1296}\\right)=\\boxed{\\dfrac{421}{1296}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's, we will use a complementary probability approach. This means we will first find the probability that Greg rolls an equal number of 1's and 6's and add the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's to get the total probability of the complement of our desired event. Then, we will subtract this result from 1 to find the desired probability.\nTo find the probability that Greg rolls an equal number of 1's and 6's, we will use the stars and bars method. The total number of ways to roll four dice is $6^4 = 1296$. The number of ways to roll two 1's and two 6's is $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$, and the number of ways to roll one 1 and one 6 with two other dice is $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 = 192$, considering that the two other dice can each be any of the 4 numbers other than 1 or 6. Therefore, the total number of ways to roll an equal number of 1's and 6's is $6+192=198$. The probability of rolling an equal number of 1's and 6's is $\\frac{198}{1296}$.\nNow, we need to find the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's. This can be achieved by considering the cases of three 6's and one 1, two 6's and two 1's, and one 6 and three 1's, and using the same method as above to find the total number of ways for each case, and then dividing by the total number of rolls, which is 1296. The total number of ways to roll three 6's and one 1 is $\\binom{4}{1} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5^3 = 1875$. The total number of ways to roll two 6's and two 1's is 198, found earlier. The total number of ways to roll one 6 and three 1's is $\\binom{4}{1} \\cdot 5^4 = 625$. Therefore, the total number of ways to roll more 6's than 1's is $1875 + 198 + 625 = 2698$, and the probability is $\\frac{2698}{1296} = \\frac{1349}{648}$. However, this\nTo find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's, we will use the complementary probability approach. We have found the probability that Greg rolls an equal number of 1's and 6's to be $\\frac{198}{1296}$ and the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's to be $\\frac{2698}{1296}$. The probability of the complement of our desired event is the sum of these two probabilities. We have that:\n\n$$P(\\text{complement}) = \\frac{198}{1296} + \\frac{2698}{1296} = \\frac{2896}{1296}$$\n\nSince the probability of an event and its complement must add up to 1, we can find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's by subtracting the probability of the complement from 1.\nTo find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's, we subtract the probability of the complement from 1:\n\n$$P(\\text{Greg rolls more 1's than 6's}) = 1 - P(\\text{complement}) = 1 - \\frac{2896}{1296}$$\nTo find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's, we need to simplify the expression $1 - \\frac{2896}{1296}$. \n\n$$1 - \\frac{2896}{1296} = \\frac{1296}{1296} - \\frac{2896}{1296} = \\frac{1296 - 2896}{1296} = \\frac{-1600}{1296}$$\n\nSince probability cannot be negative, we need to convert this fraction to a positive equivalent.
