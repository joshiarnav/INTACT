    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We calculate the probability that the digits are the same, and subtract from 1. From the 90 integers to be chosen from, only 9 have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, ..., 99. Therefore, the probability that the digits are the same is $\\frac{9}{90} = \\frac{1}{10}$, so the probability that the digits are different is $1-\\frac{1}{10}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the digits of a randomly chosen 2-digit integer are different, we first need to count the total number of 2-digit integers and the number of 2-digit integers with different digits.\n\nStep 1: Determine the total number of 2-digit integers greater than 9 and less than 100. \nThere are 90 2-digit integers in total: 10-99 (99 - 9).\nStep 2: Determine the number of 2-digit integers with different digits. To do this, consider the possible tens and ones digits separately. There are 9 choices for the tens digit (1-9) and for each choice, there are 9 choices for the ones digit (excluding the tens digit). However, this overcounts numbers where the tens and ones digit are swapped, which would be 9 numbers (11, 22, 33, ..., 99). Therefore, the total number of 2-digit integers with different digits is 9*9 - 9 = 72.\nStep 3: Calculate the probability that a randomly chosen 2-digit integer has different digits.\nTo find the probability, divide the number of 2-digit integers with different digits (72) by the total number of 2-digit integers (90). \nProbability = 72 / 90 = 0.8 = 4/5.\nStep 4: Interpret the probability.\nThe probability that a randomly chosen 2-digit integer has different digits is 4/5, which means that 4 out of every 5 2-digit integers have different digits.\nStep 5: Since the problem focuses on the probability that the digits are different, and we have already found that to be 4/5, we can conclude that the answer to the problem is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$",
