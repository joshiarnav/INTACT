    "problem": "If I have a $4\\times 4$ chess board, in how many ways can I place four distinct pawns on the board such that each column and row of the board contains no more than one pawn?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Because our chess board is $4 \\times 4$, there must be exactly one pawn in each column and each row. Consider the ways to place one pawn in each row. In the first row, there are four potential spots for a pawn. However, no matter where we place the pawn, it takes up one column. So, in the second row, there are only three potential spots for a pawn. Similarly, there are two spots in the third row and only one in the fourth. Thus, there are $4\\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 24$ ways in which we can place the pawns. Now, because each pawn is distinct, we have four possible pawns to place in the first slot, three in the second, two in the fourth, and one in the last. So there are $24$ possible orderings of the pawns. Our final answer is thus $24^2 = \\boxed{576}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can use a permutation with restrictions. \n\nStep 1: The first pawn has 16 possible positions to choose from (4 rows x 4 columns).\nStep 2: After placing the first pawn, we have 9 possible positions for the second pawn (3 rows and 3 columns not containing the first pawn).\nStep 3: After placing the first two pawns, we have 4 possible positions for the third pawn (2 rows and 2 columns not containing the first two pawns). Similarly, after placing the first three pawns, we have 1 possible position for the fourth pawn. Therefore, the total number of ways is 16 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1.\nStep 4: The total number of ways to place the four distinct pawns is 16 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1 = 576.\nThe total number of ways to place the four distinct pawns is 16 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1 = 576.\nStep 5: The total number of ways to place the four distinct pawns is the result from the previous step, which is 16 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1 = 576.\nStep 6: Therefore, the total number of ways to place four distinct pawns on the $4\\times 4$ chess board is 576.\nStep 7: This is the final step, and the solution is already calculated in Step 4.\nStep 5: Since we have calculated all possible positions for each pawn uniquely, the total number of ways to place the four distinct pawns on the $4\\times 4$ chess board is already determined.\nStep 8: This is the final step, and the solution is already calculated in Step 4.
