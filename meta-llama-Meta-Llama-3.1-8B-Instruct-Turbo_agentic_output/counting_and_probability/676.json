    "problem": "I have 10 distinguishable socks in my drawer: 4 white, 4 brown, and 2 blue.  In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of the same color?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue.  If the socks are white, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are brown, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are blue, there is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ choice.  So the total number of choices for socks is $6 + 6 + 1 = \\boxed{13}$.",

Both socks are blue\nSince the socks are distinguishable, the number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color is given by the number of combinations of selecting 2 socks from the available socks of each color. \n\nNext step: Compute the number of ways to choose a pair of socks for each case by using the combination formula: C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of socks of each color.\nFor each case, we compute the number of ways to choose a pair of socks using the combination formula:\n\n1.
