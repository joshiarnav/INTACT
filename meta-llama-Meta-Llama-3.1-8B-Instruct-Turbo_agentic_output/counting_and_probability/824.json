    "problem": "I have a drawer with 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives in it. If I reach in and randomly remove three pieces of silverware, what is the probability that I get one fork, one spoon, and one knife?",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "First, we can find the denominator of our fraction.  There are a total of $\\dbinom{18}{3}=816$ ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware out of 18.  To find the numerator, we need to count the number of ways to choose one piece of each type of silverware.  There are 6 ways we could choose a fork, 6 ways to choose a spoon, and 6 ways to choose a knife, making a total of $6\\cdot 6 \\cdot 6=216$ ways to choose a fork, a knife, and a spoon so our final probability is $\\frac{216}{816}=\\boxed{\\frac{9}{34}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability, we first need to determine the total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware from 18. This can be done using the combination formula: \n\nTotal number of ways = C(18, 3) = 18! / (3! * (18-3)!)\nThe next step is to calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware from 18, which is:\n\nTotal number of ways = C(18, 3) = 18! / (3! * (18-3)!)\n= (18 * 17 * 16) / (3 * 2 * 1) \n= 816\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife. There are 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives, so we can choose one of each in 6 * 6 * 6 ways.\n\nNumber of favorable outcomes = 6 * 6 * 6 = 216.\nTo find the probability, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of ways)\n= (216) / (816)\nNow, we can simplify the fraction to find the probability. \n\nProbability = (216) / (816)\n= 27 / 102\n= 9 / 34\nThe probability that you get one fork, one spoon, and one knife is $\\boxed{9/34}$.",
