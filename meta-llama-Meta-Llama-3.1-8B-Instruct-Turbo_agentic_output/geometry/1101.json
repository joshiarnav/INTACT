    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ has vertices with coordinates $A(2,3),$ $B(7,8),$ and $C(-4,6)$. The triangle is reflected about line $L$. The image points are $A'(2,-5),$ $B'(7,-10),$ and $C'(-4,-8)$. What is the equation of line $L$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Since only the $y$ portions of the coordinates move, we know that the line of reflection must be a horizontal line. Now we just need to find the midpoint between an original point and its reflected image to pinpoint the location of the line. The $y$-coordinate of point $A$ is 3 and the $y$-coordinate of $A'$ is $-5$; therefore, the midpoint is at $(2, -1)$. The line of refection is $\\boxed{y = -1}$.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Find the midpoint of the line segment joining each vertex to its image, as the line of reflection $L$ is the perpendicular bisector of these line segments. The midpoint formula is $\\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right)$.\nStep 2: Calculate the midpoints of the line segments joining each vertex to its image. For example, the midpoint of the line segment joining $A(2,3)$ to $A'(2,-5)$ is $\\left( \\frac{2+2}{2}, \\frac{3+(-5)}{2} \\right) = (2, -1)$. Repeat this process for the other two line segments.\nStep 3: Once the midpoints are calculated, find the equation of the line that passes through these midpoints, which is line $L$. Since the line is a vertical line for points A and A', and a horizontal line for points B and B', we can determine its equation directly. For points A and A', the x-coordinate is constant, so the equation is a vertical line. For points B and B', the y-coordinate is constant, so the equation is a horizontal line.\nStep 4: Determine the equation of line $L$. The midpoint of the line segment joining $A(2,3)$ to $A'(2,-5)$ is $(2,-1)$, and the midpoint of the line segment joining $B(7,8)$ to $B'(7,-10)$ is $(7,-1)$. The midpoints have the same x-coordinate, so line $L$ is a vertical line. Its equation is $x = k$, where $k$ is the x-coordinate of the midpoints.\nStep 5: The equation of a vertical line is in the form $x = k$, where $k$ is the x-coordinate of the midpoints, which are $(2, -1)$ and $(7, -1)$. Since the x-coordinates of both midpoints are the same, we can directly substitute that value to find the equation of line $L$, which is $x = -1$.\nStep 6: The equation of line $L$ is $x = k$, where $k$ is the x-coordinate of the midpoints. Since the x-coordinates of both midpoints are the same, we can directly substitute that value to find the equation of line $L$.\n\n$\\boxed{x = -1}$",
