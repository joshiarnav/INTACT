    "problem": "A hemisphere-shaped bowl with radius 1 foot is filled full with chocolate.  All of the chocolate is then evenly distributed between 27 congruent, smaller hemisphere-shaped molds.  What is the radius of each of the smaller molds, in feet?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so a hemisphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$.  The large hemisphere-shaped bowl has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi(1^3) = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ cubic feet.\n\nLet each of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds have radius $r$.  Their total volume, in terms of $r$, is $27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$ cubic feet, so we have \\[27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi.\\]Dividing both sides by $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ yields $27r^3 =1$, so $r=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$ feet.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: Calculate the volume of the chocolate in the large hemisphere-shaped bowl.\nThe volume of a hemisphere with radius r is given by V = (2/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. \nFor the large bowl, the volume V_large = (2/3)\u03c0(1)\u00b3.\nStep 2: The volume of each smaller hemisphere-shaped mold is given by V_small = (2/3)\u03c0r_small\u00b3, where r_small is the radius of the smaller mold. Since the total volume of chocolate is evenly distributed between 27 molds, we can set up the equation: V_large = 27 * V_small. Substituting the known values, we have (2/3)\u03c0(1)\u00b3 = 27 * (2/3)\u03c0r_small\u00b3. Simplifying the equation, we get 1 = 27r_small\u00b3. Solving for r_small, we find r_small\u00b3 = 1/27. Taking the cube root of both sides gives us r_small = \u221b(1/27).\nStep 3: To find the radius of each smaller mold, we take the cube root of 1/27. The cube root of 1/27 is 1/3, so the radius of each smaller mold is 1/3 feet.\nStep 4: We now have the radius of each smaller mold, which is r_small = 1/3 feet.\nStep 5: The radius of each smaller mold is 1/3 feet.\nStep 6: Therefore, the radius of each of the smaller molds is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$ feet.",
