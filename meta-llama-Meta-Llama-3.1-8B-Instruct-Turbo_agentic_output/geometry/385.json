    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of the right, rectangular prism, let's denote the length, width, and height as l, w, and h, respectively. \n\nFirst step: Recognize that the given areas are the products of the dimensions. Pair the given areas with their respective dimensions and set up the equations:\n\n- l * w = 15\n- l * h = 10\n- w * h = 6\nTo find the volume, multiply the three equations together to eliminate l, w, and h, resulting in (l * w * h)^2 = 15 * 10 * 6. Taking the square root of both sides, we get l * w * h = \u221a(15 * 10 * 6). \n\nWe will solve for l * w * h in the next step.\nSecond step: To find the volume of the prism, we calculate the product of the length, width, and height, which equals the square root of (15 * 10 * 6). The product of 15 and 10 is 150, and 150 * 6 is 900. Therefore, l * w * h = \u221a900 = 30.\nThird step: Since we've established that l * w * h = 30, we know that the volume of the right, rectangular prism is 30 cubic inches.\nFourth step: Since we know that the volume of the prism (l * w * h) is 30 cubic inches, this is our solution, and we can present our final answer.\nFourth step: Since we know that l * w * h = 30, this is our solution, and we can present our final answer.\nFourth step: Since we know that l * w * h = 30, this is our solution, and we can present our final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{30}$",
