By the Two Tangent Theorem, $AP = AQ = 23$, $BP = BR = 27$, and $CQ = CR = x$. Using $rs = A$, where $s = \\frac{27 \\cdot 2 + 23 \\cdot 2 + x \\cdot 2}{2} = 50 + x$, we get $(21)(50 + x) = A$. By Heron's formula, $A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{(50+x)(x)(23)(27)}$. Equating and squaring both sides,\n\\begin{eqnarray*}  [21(50+x)]^2 &=& (50+x)(x)(621)\\\\ 441(50+x) &=& 621x\\\\ 180x = 441 \\cdot 50 &\\Longrightarrow & x = \\frac{245}{2}   \\end{eqnarray*}\nWe want the perimeter, which is $2s = 2\\left(50 + \\frac{245}{2}\\right) = \\boxed{345}$.",
