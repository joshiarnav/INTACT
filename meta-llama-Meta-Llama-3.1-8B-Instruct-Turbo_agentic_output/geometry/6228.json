Draw $X$, where $X$ is on $BC$ and $AC \\parallel PX$. By AA Similarity, $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle PBX$, so $PX = 3an$, $BX = 4an$, and $CX = 4an - 4n$.\nAlso, let $\\angle ABC = a$ and $\\angle BAC = b$. Since the angles of a triangle add up to $180^{\\circ}$, $\\angle BCA = 180-a-b$. By Exterior Angle Theorem, $\\angle ACX = a+b$, and since $CP$ bisects $\\angle ACX$, $\\angle PCX = \\frac{a+b}{2}$. Because $AC \\parallel PX$, $\\angle BXP = 180 - a - b$. Thus, $\\angle CPX = \\frac{a+b}{2}$, making $\\triangle CPX$ an isosceles triangle.\nBecause $\\triangle CPX$ is isosceles, $PX = CX$, so $4an - 4n = 3an$. That means $a = 4$, so $PB = 4 \\cdot AB$. Thus, $PA = PB - AB = 3 \\cdot AB$, so $PA : AB = \\boxed{3:1}$.",
