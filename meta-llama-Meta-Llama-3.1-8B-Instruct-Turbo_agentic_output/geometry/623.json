    "solution": "Let the coordinates of $A$ be $(a_1,a_2)$. Then since $A$ is on the graph of $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, we know that $a_2 = -\\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$. We can also use our knowledge of special right triangles to write $a_2$ in terms of $a_1$. Let $C$ be the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ and let $O$ be the origin. Then $OCA$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, so the ratio of the length of $OC$ to the length of $CA$ is $\\sqrt{3}:1$. Now the coordinates of C are $(0, a_2)$, so the length of $OC$ is just $-a_2$ (since $a_2$ is negative) and the length of $CA$ is $a_1$. This means $\\dfrac{-a_2}{a_1}=\\sqrt{3} \\Longrightarrow a_2=-\\sqrt{3}a_1$.\n\nWe can now set our two equations for $a_2$ equal to each other and get $-\\sqrt{3}a_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$. Multiplying both sides by $-\\frac{2}{a_1}$ immediately gives $a_1=2\\sqrt{3}$. From here we could solve for $a_2$ using one of our equations and then use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the side length of the equilateral triangle, but there's a better way. We remember that the hypotenuse of our special triangle is twice as long as the shortest side of it, which has length $a_1=2\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore our answer is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$.",
