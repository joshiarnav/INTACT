    "model_solution": "Step 1:  To find $\\cos C$ in the given right triangle, we will use the definition of cosine in a right triangle, which is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. \n    We observe that side $AC$ is the side adjacent to angle $C$, and side $BC$ is the hypotenuse.\nStep 2:  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of side $AC$. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Therefore, $AC^2 = BC^2 - AB^2$.\nStep 3:  Substituting the given values into the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $AC^2 = BC^2 - AB^2 = 10^2 - 6^2 = 100 - 36 = 64$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $AC = \\sqrt{64} = 8$.\nStep 4:  Now that we have the lengths of the adjacent side and the hypotenuse, we can find $\\cos C$ by using the definition of cosine: $\\cos C = \\frac{AC}{BC} = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, $\\cos C = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$.\nStep 6:  Now that we have found the value of $\\cos C$ as $\\frac{4}{5}$, we can conclude that our final answer is indeed $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$.",
