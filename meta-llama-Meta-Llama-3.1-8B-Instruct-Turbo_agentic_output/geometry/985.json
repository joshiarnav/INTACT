    "solution": "At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{2}{3}(360^\\circ)=240$ degrees.  Every minute, the minute hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}(360^\\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12} (360^\\circ)=0.5$ degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.  After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\\circ-5.5^\\circ\\cdot 15=\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees.",

    "model_solution": "Step 1: At 8:15, the minute hand will be 15/60 = 1/4 of the way around the clock, and the hour hand will be 8 + 15/12 = 8 + 1.25 = 9.25 of the 12 equal sections around the clock.\nStep 2: The full circle is 360 degrees, and since the clock is divided into 12 equal sections, each section corresponds to 30 degrees. The distance between the 8 and 9 on the clock is 30 degrees, so the hour hand has moved 9.25 * 30 = 277.5 degrees from the 8 o'clock position. The minute hand has moved 15 * 6 = 90 degrees from the 12 o'clock position. Therefore, the angle between the two hands is 277.5 - 90 = 187.5 degrees.\nStep 3: Since 187.5 degrees is the larger angle between the two hands, we need to subtract it from 360 to find the smaller angle, which is $360 - 187.5 = 172.5$ degrees.\nStep 4: Since the smaller angle is 172.5 degrees, which is less than 180, it is the correct answer.\nStep 5: The problem asks for the angle to the nearest tenth, and since 172.5 degrees is already a precise decimal to the nearest tenth, this is the final step.\nStep 6: Therefore, the number of degrees in the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock at 8:15 is 172.5 degrees.\nStep 6: The problem asks for the angle to the nearest tenth, and since 172.5 degrees is already a precise decimal to the nearest tenth, this is the final step.\nStep 7: Since the smaller angle is 172.5 degrees, this is the final answer.\nStep 8: Since 172.5 degrees is already a precise decimal to the nearest tenth, this is the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{172.5}$",
