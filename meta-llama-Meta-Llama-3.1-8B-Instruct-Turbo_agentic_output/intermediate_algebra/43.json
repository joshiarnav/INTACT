    "problem": "A function $f$ is defined by $f(z) = i\\overline{z}$, where $i^2 = -1$ and $\\overline{z}$ is the complex conjugate of $z$. How many values of $z$ satisfy both $|z| = 5$ and $f(z) = z$?",

    "solution": "Let $z = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.  Then $|z| = 5$ becomes $x^2 + y^2 = 25,$ and $f(z) = z$ becomes\n\\[i(x - yi) = x + yi.\\]Then $ix + y = x + yi,$ so $x = y.$\n\nHence, $2x^2 = 25,$ which has two solutions.  Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ such values of $z.$",

Let $z = a + bi$, then $\\overline{z} = a - bi$. Substituting these into the equation, we get $i(a - bi) = a + bi$.\nMultiply both sides of the equation $i(a - bi) = a + bi$ by $-i$ to simplify. This gives $a + bi = -ia - b$, which can be rearranged into $(a + b) + i(-a + b) = 0$. \n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts to zero gives us two equations: $a + b = 0$ and $-a + b = 0$.\nWe now have two equations: $a + b = 0$ and $-a + b = 0$. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation yields $-2a = 0$, which gives $a = 0$. Substituting $a = 0$ back into the first equation, we get $b = 0$. However, we know that $a^2 + b^2 = 25$.\nSince we know that $a^2 + b^2 = 25$ and we found that $a = 0$ and $b = 0$, substituting these values into the equation yields $0^2 + 0^2 = 25$, which simplifies to $0 = 25$. This is a contradiction, so our initial conclusion that $a = 0$ and $b = 0$ is incorrect. \n\nWe must re-examine the equations $a + b = 0$ and $-a + b = 0$. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation yields $-2a = 0$, which gives $a = 0$. However, this is not necessarily true. Instead, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation and solve the resulting equation for $a$.\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation yields $-2a = 0$. However, instead of immediately concluding that $a = 0$, we notice that this equation is true for any value of $a$ because both sides are zero.\nSince $-2a = 0$, we notice that this equation is true for any value of $a$ because both sides are zero. We can then express $b$ in terms of $a$ using the equation $a + b = 0$, which gives $b = -a$. Substituting $b = -a$ into the equation $a^2 + b^2 = 25$ gives $a^2 + (-a)^2 = 25$, which simplifies to $2a^2 = 25$.\nWe now have the equation $2a^2 = 25$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives $a^2 = \\frac{25}{2}$. However, this is a contradiction because $a^2 \\geq 0$ for all real numbers $a$.\nWe now revisit the equation $a + b = 0$. Instead of using the equation $-a + b = 0$, let us first isolate $b$ from the equation $a + b = 0$, which gives $b = -a$. \n\nSubstituting $b = -a$ into the equation $a^2 + b^2 = 25$, we get $a^2 + (-a)^2 = 25$, which simplifies to $2a^2 = 25$.\nDividing both sides of the equation $2a^2 = 25$ by 2 gives $a^2 = \\frac{25}{2}$.
