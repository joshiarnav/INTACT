    "solution": "Let $r$ and $s$ be the two common roots.  Then $r$ and $s$ are the roots of\n\\[(x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) - (x^3 + bx^2 + 14 + 8) = (a - b) x^2 - 3x - 2.\\]Note that $r$ and $s$ are also the roots of\n\\begin{align*}\n&4(x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) - 3(x^3 + bx^2 + 14x + 8) \\\\\n&= x^3 + (4a - 3b) x^2 + 2x \\\\\n&= x[x^2 + (4a - 3b) x + 2].\n\\end{align*}Since the constant coefficient of $x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6$ is nonzero, both $r$ and $s$ are non-zero.  Therefore, $r$ and $s$ are the roots of\n\\[x^2 + (4a - 3b) x + 2.\\]Hence, both $r$ and $s$ are the roots of $-x^2 + (3b - 4a) x - 2.$  But $r$ and $s$ are also the roots of $(a - b) x^2 - 3x - 2,$ so the coefficients must match.  This gives us $a - b = -1$ and $3b - 4a = -3.$  Solving, we find $(a,b) = \\boxed{(6,7)}.$\n\nFor these values, the given cubics become\n\\begin{align*}\nx^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6 &= (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3), \\\\\nx^3 + 7x^2 + 14x + 8 &= (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 4).\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "Step 1:  Let $r$, $s$, and $t$ be the roots of the first cubic polynomial $x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6 = 0$. We also define $p$, $q$, and $r$ as the roots of the second cubic polynomial $x^3 + bx^2 + 14x + 8 = 0$.\n  The goal is to find the ordered pair $(a,b)$ such that these two cubic polynomials have two distinct roots in common.\n\nStep 2: We can apply Vieta's formulas to relate the coefficients of each polynomial to the sum and product of its roots.\nStep 3:  By Vieta's formulas for the first cubic polynomial, we have $r + s + t = -a$, $rs + rt + st = 11$, and $rst = -6$. For the second cubic polynomial, we have $p + q + r = -b$, $pq + qr + pr = 14$, and $pqr = -8$.\n\nNow, we need to establish the relationships between the two sets of roots to solve for $(a,b)$.\nStep 4: Since the two polynomials have two distinct roots in common, let's assume without loss of generality that $r =  p$ and $s = q$. Then, we can equate the expressions for the sum and product of the roots for both polynomials to establish relationships between $a$ and $b$. This gives us $r + s + t = p + q + r$ and $rs + rt + st = pq + qr + pr$. Simplifying these expressions will allow us to relate $a$ and $b$.\nStep 5:  From the equation $r + s + t = p + q + r$, we have $t = q$. Substituting $r = p$ and $s = q$ into the equation $rs + rt + st = pq + qr + pr$ gives $pq + p^2 + pq = 14$. This simplifies to $2pq + p^2 = 14$. We can substitute $p = r$ and $q = s$ into the equation $pq + qr + pr = 14$ to get $pq + ps + pr = 14$. Given $pq + p^2 + pq = 14$ and $pq + ps + pr = 14$, we can equate these equations to establish a relationship between the common roots and the coefficients.\nStep 6: Equating the two equations $2pq + p^2 = 14$ and $pq + ps + pr = 14$, we can solve for the relationship between $p$, $q$, and $s$. Since $pq + ps + pr = 14$, we can rewrite it as $pq + p(s + r) = 14$. Given $2pq + p^2 = 14$, we can substitute $p^2 = 2pq - 14$ into the equation $pq + ps + pr = 14$ to get $pq + p(s + r) = 14$. This simplifies to $pq + p(a - p) = 14$, where $a$ is derived from the relationship $r + s + t = p + q + r$. Using the equation $pq + p(a - p) = 14$, we can solve for the relationship between $p$, $a$, and $q$.\nStep 7:  Rearranging the equation $pq + p(a - p) = 14$ gives $pq + ap - p^2 = 14$. Since we have $pq + qr + pr = 14$, we can substitute $q = t$ and $r = p$ to get $pt + p^2 + pt = 14$. This simplifies to $2pt + p^2 = 14$. Comparing this with $pq + ap - p^2 = 14$, we can rewrite the second equation as $pq + at - p^2 = 14$. The difference between the two equations $2pt + p^2 = 14$ and $pq + at - p^2 = 14$ gives us $pt - at + q = 0$, or $p(t - a) = -q$.\nStep 8:  Since $p(t - a) = -q$, we also have $pq = -(t - a)q$. Substituting $pq = -(t - a)q$ into the equation $2pq + p^2 = 14$ gives $-2(t - a)q + p^2 = 14$. We also have $pq + ps + pr = 14$, which can be rewritten as $pq + p(a - p) = 14$. Substituting $pq = -(t - a)q$ into the equation $pq + p(a - p) = 14$ gives $-(t - a)q + p(a - p) = 14$. Equating the two expressions for $pq$, we can solve for $t$ in terms of $a$ and $p$.\nStep 9: Equating the two expressions $-2(t - a)q + p^2 = 14$ and $-(t - a)q + p(a - p) = 14$, we have $-2(t - a)q + p^2 = -(t - a)q + p(a - p)$. Simplifying this equation will allow us to solve for $t$ in terms of $a$ and $p$.\nStep 10: Rearranging the equation $-2(t - a)q + p^2 = -(t - a)q + p(a - p)$ gives $-2(t - a)q + (t - a)q = p^2 - p(a - p)$. This simplifies to $-(t - a)q = p^2 - p(a - p)$. Since $-(t - a)q = p^2 - p(a - p)$, we have $-(t - a)q = p^2 - pa + p^2$. This further simplifies to $-(t - a)q = -pa + 2p^2$.\nStep 11: Simplifying the equation $-(t - a)q = -pa + 2p^2$ gives $-(t - a)q = p(-a + 2p)$. Since $-(t - a)q = p(-a + 2p)$, we have $-(t - a) = (-a + 2p) \\cdot \\frac{q}{p} = (-a + 2p) \\cdot \\frac{t}{t} = (-a + 2p) \\cdot \\frac{t}{t}$, which can be rewritten as $t - a = a - 2p$. Rearranging this equation, we get $t + p = 2a$.",
