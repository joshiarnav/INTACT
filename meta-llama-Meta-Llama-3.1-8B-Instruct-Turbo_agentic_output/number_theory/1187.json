The arithmetic mean is the sum divided by the number of terms.\nArithmetic mean = 728 / 13\nArithmetic mean = 56.\nThe arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7 is 56.\nThe next step is to verify the solution by calculating the arithmetic mean using the numbers directly: \nArithmetic mean = (14 + 21 + 28 + 35 + 42 + 49 + 56 + 63 + 70 + 77 + 84 + 91 + 98) / 13.\nLet's calculate the sum directly and verify the solution:\nArithmetic mean = (14 + 21 + 28 + 35 + 42 + 49 + 56 + 63 + 70 + 77 + 84 + 91 + 98) / 13\nArithmetic mean = 628 / 13\nTo verify the solution, we need to calculate 628 divided by 13. \n\nArithmetic mean = 628 / 13\nArithmetic mean = 48.307692307692, rounding to the nearest whole number (since the numbers are integers), the arithmetic mean is 48.\nThis contradicts our initial result of 56. There seems to be a discrepancy in the calculation.\nTo find the discrepancy, let's re-examine the initial step where the sum was calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: Sum = (n/2)(a + l). We found the sum to be 728, which led to an initial arithmetic mean of 56. \n\nHowever, re-calculating the sum directly as (14 + 21 + 28 + 35 + 42 + 49 + 56 + 63 + 70 + 77 + 84 + 91 + 98) yielded a different result of 628. \n\nA closer look reveals that the correct sum should be found using the arithmetic series formula. The mistake seems to be in the simplification of the formula: Sum = (13/2)(14 + 98) = (13/2)(112) is correct, but let's break it down further to ensure accuracy.\n\n(13/2)(112) = 13 * 56 (since 112 is divisible by 2)\n= 728\n\nThis step seems correct; however, there might have been an error in evaluating (14 + 98) = 112.\nLet's re-evaluate the correct sum of the arithmetic series using the formula: Sum = (n/2)(a + l). \n\nThe correct calculation is: \n(13/2)(112) = 13 * 56 (since 112 is divisible by 2)\nHowever, this simplification is incorrect. \nThe correct simplification should be: \nSum = (13/2)(112)\nSum = (13/2)(14 + 80) \nSum = (13/2)(14 + (70 + 10))\nSum = (13/2)((14 + 70) + 10)\nSum = (13/2)(84 + 10)\nSum = (13/2)(94)\nSum = 6.5 * 94\nSum = 613\nNow that we have the correct sum of the arithmetic series, we can find the arithmetic mean by dividing the sum by the total number of terms.\n\nArithmetic mean = 613 / 13",
