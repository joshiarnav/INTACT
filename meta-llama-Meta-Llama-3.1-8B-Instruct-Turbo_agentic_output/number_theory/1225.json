    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Every multiple of 25 ends in 00, 25, 50, or 75.  Since we want the product of the digits to be a positive multiple of 25, the final two digits must be either 25 or 75.\n\nA nonzero product of digits is a multiple of 25 exactly when two or more of the digits is are equal to 5. If a number ends in 75 and the product of its digits is a multiple of 25, then replacing 75 by 25 in that number will also give a smaller number whose product of digits is a multiple of 25.  Therefore we are looking for a number whose final two digits are 25 and for which 5 is one of the other digits.\n\nSince 525 is the smallest such number, the answer must be $\\boxed{525}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25, first note that any multiple of 25 must end in 00, 25, 50, or 75. However, since we need the product of its digits to be a multiple of 25, the number must contain at least two factors of 5.\nSince the number must contain at least two factors of 5, it cannot end in 00 or 75. Thus, we need to consider multiples ending in 25 or 50. To find the least multiple, let's start with the smallest possible hundreds digit, 1, and examine the first few multiples of 25 in the 125 and 150 series.\nWe need to consider multiples ending in 25 or 50. Starting with the 125 series, the first few multiples are 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, and 250. Multiplying their digits gives us products of 1 (from 125), 1*5 = 5 (from 150), 1*7*5 = 35 (from 175), 2*0*0 = 0 (from 200), 2*2*5 = 20 (from 225), and 2*5*0 = 0 (from 250). \n\nThe digit product of 250 is 0, which is a multiple of 25.\nSince we found a number in the 125 series that meets the condition (250), we can conclude that 250 is indeed the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25.\nNow that we have confirmed that 250 is the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25, we can conclude that our solution is complete. \n\n$\\boxed{250}$",
