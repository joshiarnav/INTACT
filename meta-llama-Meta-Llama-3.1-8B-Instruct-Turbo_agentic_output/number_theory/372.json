    "solution": "We can test an integer for divisibility by $11$ by alternately adding and subtracting its digits.  For example, $8162$ is divisible by 11 because $8-1+6-2=11$ is divisible by 11.  In this case, $2A-2B+C$ must be divisible by 11.  If there are satisfactory values of $B$ and $C$ corresponding to $A=9$, then the resulting integer would be larger than any integer with $A<9$.  Therefore, we try $A=9$ first.  If $A=9$, then $C-2B+18$ must be divisible by $11$.  Equivalently, $C-2B$ equals $-7$ or $4$, which implies $C=2B-7$ or $C=2B+4$.  Wanting to make $B$ as large as possible, we try $B=9,8,7,\\ldots$. $B$ cannot be $9$ because $A$, $B$, and $C$ must be distinct.  If $B=8$, then $C=9$, so again the digits are not distinct.  If $B=7$, then $C=7$ and still the digits are not distinct.  If $B=6$, then $C=5$, and $AB,\\!CBA=\\boxed{96,\\!569}$.",

    "model_solution": "To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we can use the rule that the alternating sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 11. For the given number $AB,CBA$, the alternating sum is $A - B + C - B + A$.\nThe next step is to simplify the expression $A - B + C - B + A$ to $2A - 2B + C$ and set it equal to a multiple of 11, since the alternating sum must be divisible by 11.\nWe know that $2A - 2B + C$ must be divisible by 11, so we can write $2A - 2B + C = 11k$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer. \n\nHowever, since A, B, and C are distinct digits, we must consider the possible values of A, B, and C and look for the greatest possible value of AB,CBA.\nSince $A$, $B$, and $C$ are distinct digits, we should start with the largest possible value for $A$, which is 9, as it will give us the greatest possible value for $AB,CBA$.\nGiven that $A = 9$, substitute into $2A - 2B + C = 11k$ to get $18 - 2B + C = 11k$. Since we're trying to find the greatest possible value, let's simplify this further by considering the possible values of $B$ and $C$.\nSince $18 - 2B + C = 11k$, we can further simplify the equation by considering the possible values of $B$ and $C$. Given that $B$ and $C$ are distinct digits, let's consider the possible values of $B$ that would result in a multiple of 11 when subtracted from 18 and added to $C$. We can see that if $B = 8$, then $18 - 2B = 18 - 16 = 2$. This means that $C$ must be 20, but since $C$ is a single digit, this is not a valid solution.\n\nHowever, since we want to find the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$, let's try $B = 7$. In this case, $18 - 2B = 18 - 14 = 4$. This means that $C$ must be 4 + 11k, so we need to find a value of k that makes C a single digit.\nSince $B = 7$, we have $18 - 2B = 18 - 14 = 4$. To find a valid value of C, we need to find a value of k that makes $4 + 11k$ a single digit. We can try $k = 1$, which gives $4 + 11(1) = 15$. However, this is still not a valid solution since $C$ is not a single digit.\n\nWe can try $k = 2$, which gives $4 + 11(2) = 26$. This is still not a valid solution since $C$ is not a single digit.\n\nWe can try $k = 3$, which gives $4 + 11(3) = 37$. This is still not a valid solution since $C$ is not a single digit.\n\nWe can try $k = 4$, which gives $4 + 11(4) = 48$. This is still not a valid solution since $C$ is not a single digit.\n\nWe can try $k = 5$, which gives $4 + 11(5) = 59$.

This is a valid solution since $C = 4$ is a single digit. \n\nSo, we have $A = 9$, $B = 7$, and $C = 4$.\nThe next step is to substitute these values of $A$, $B$, and $C$ into the number $AB,CBA$ to get the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$. \n\n$AB,CBA = 9,7,4,9,7 = 979,479$\nNow that we have $A = 9$, $B = 7$, and $C = 4$, we can substitute these values into the number $AB,CBA$ to get the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$, which is $979,479$.",
