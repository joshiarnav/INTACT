    "solution": "Write $9$ as $10-1$ and consider raising 9 to the 2004 power by multiplying out the expression \\[\n\\overbrace{(10-1)(10-1)(10-1)\\cdots(10-1)}^{2004\\text{ factors}}\n\\] There will be $2^{2004}$ terms in this expansion (one for each way to choose either 10 or $-1$ for each of the 2004 factors of $(10-1)$), but most of them will not affect the tens or units digit because they will have two or more factors of 10 and therefore will be divisible by 100.  Only the 2004 terms of $-10$ which come from choosing $-1$ in 2003 of the factors and 10 in the remaining one as well as the term $(-1)^{2004}=1$ remain.  Let $N$ represent the sum of all of the terms with more than 1 factor of 10.  We have \\begin{align*}\n(10-1)^{2004}&=N+2004(-10)+1\\\\\n&= N-20,\\!040+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-40+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-39.\n\\end{align*} So $9^{2004}$ is 39 less than a multiple of 100 and therefore ends in 61.  The sum of 6 and 1 is $\\boxed{7}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the tens and units digit of $9^{2004}$, we first need to find the pattern of the last two digits of powers of 9. \n\nThe last two digits of $9^1$ are 09, and we can start calculating the last two digits of higher powers of 9.\nTo find the last two digits of higher powers of 9, we can start calculating the last two digits of $9^2$, $9^3$, and so on, until we find a repeating pattern. \n\nSince $9^2 = 81$, the last two digits of $9^2$ are 81. \n\nNow, we can continue with the next power: \n$9^3 = 9^2 \\times 9 = 729$, so the last two digits of $9^3$ are 29. \n$9^4 = 9^3 \\times 9 = 6561$, so the last two digits of $9^4$ are 61. \n$9^5 = 9^4 \\times 9 = 59049$, so the last two digits of $9^5$ are 49. \n$9^6 = 9^5 \\times 9 = 531441$, so the last two digits of $9^6$ are 41. \n$9^7 = 9^6 \\times 9 = 4782969$, so the last two digits of $9^7$ are 69. \n$\nNow, we need to find the last two digits of higher powers of 9 to see if there's a repeating pattern. \n\nContinuing the calculation:\n$9^8 = 9^7 \\times 9 = 43046721$, so the last two digits of $9^8$ are 21.\n$9^9 = 9^8 \\times 9 = 387420489$, so the last two digits of $9^9$ are 89.\n$9^{10} = 9^9 \\times 9 = 3486784401$, so the last two digits of $9^{10}$ are 01.\nSince the last two digits of $9^{10}$ are 01, which is the same as the last two digits of $9^1$, we can conclude that the sequence repeats every 10 powers of 9.\nSince the powers of 9 repeat every 10 powers, we can use this pattern to find the last two digits of $9^{2004}$. Since 2004 is a multiple of 10 (2004 = 10*200 + 4), the last two digits of $9^{2004}$ will be the same as the last two digits of $9^4$, which is 61.
