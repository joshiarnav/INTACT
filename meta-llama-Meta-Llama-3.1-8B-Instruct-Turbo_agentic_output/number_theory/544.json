    "problem": "When Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 5, she has 3 remaining, and when she divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 remaining. If Claire has fewer than 60 cupcakes, what is the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that she could have?",

    "solution": "If Claire has $N$ cupcakes, we know that $N = 5x+3$ and $N = 7y+4$ for some integers $x$ and $y$. Equating these two forms of $N$, we have $7y+1=5x$. We also know that $N<60$. We can write out all the sufficiently small possible values of $7y+1$: $$1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57.$$Of these, the numbers that are also of the form $5x$ are $15$ and $50$. These correspond to solutions $N=18,$ $N=53$. Thus, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes is $53+18 = \\boxed{71}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's first write down the given information in the form of equations:\n\n1. x \u2261 3 (mod 5)\n2. x \u2261 4 (mod 7)\n\nwhere x is the total number of cupcakes Claire has.\nTo solve for x, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) or list out the solutions for each congruence. We'll start by listing out the solutions for the first congruence: x \u2261 3 (mod 5). The solutions will be in the form of x = 5k + 3, where k is a non-negative integer.\nList out the solutions for the second congruence: x \u2261 4 (mod 7). The solutions will be in the form of x = 7m + 4, where m is a non-negative integer.\nNow, we will equate the two expressions from the congruences. Equating x = 5k + 3 and x = 7m + 4, we get 5k + 3 = 7m + 4. Rearranging this equation, we get 5k - 7m = 1. This is a linear Diophantine equation, and we can solve it using the method of substitution or by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5 and 7.\nTo solve the linear Diophantine equation 5k - 7m = 1, we can use the Euclidean algorithm or the method of substitution. First, let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5 and 7, which is 1 (since 5 and 7 are relatively prime). Then, we can find the particular solution by inspection or using the extended Euclidean algorithm. For example, we can see that k = 3 and m = 2 is a particular solution, since 5(3) - 7(2) = 15 - 14 = 1.\nNow, since we have a particular solution k = 3 and m = 2, we can find the general solution to the linear Diophantine equation. We know that k = 3 + 7n and m = 2 + 5n for any integer n. We can substitute these expressions into x = 5k + 3 and x = 7m + 4 to get a general solution to the original system of congruences.\nNow, substitute k = 3 + 7n and m = 2 + 5n into x = 5k + 3 and x = 7m + 4 to get a general solution to the original system of congruences. \n\nx = 5(3 + 7n) + 3 = 15 + 35n + 3 = 18 + 35n \n\nNow, find all possible values of x that are less than 60 by plugging in different values of n.\nSubstitute x = 18 + 35n into the condition that x < 60. \n\nSince 18 + 35n < 60, we have 35n < 42.\n\nDividing both sides by 35, we get n < 42/35. \n\nSimplifying, we get n < 1.1714.\n\nSince n is an integer, we find all possible values of n less than 1.1714, which are n = 0 and n = 1.\n\nThen, plug in these values of n into the equation x = 18 + 35n to find all possible values of x. \n\nFor n = 0, x = 18. For n = 1, x = 53.\nNow that we have found all possible values of x (18 and 53), we need to check if both values satisfy the two original congruences. We will plug in x = 18 and x = 53 into the congruences x \u2261 3 (mod 5) and x \u2261 4 (mod 7) to verify if they are indeed solutions.\nTo verify if x = 18 and x = 53 are solutions to the original congruences, plug them into x \u2261 3 (mod 5) and x \u2261 4 (mod 7). \n\nFor x = 18, we have 18 \u2261 3 (mod 5) and 18 \u2261 4 (mod 7), which are true. \n\nFor x = 53, we have 53 \u2261 3 (mod 5) and 53 \u2261 4 (mod 7), which are also true.\n\nTherefore, both x = 18 and x = 53 are valid solutions to the original system of congruences. \n\nNow, we need to find the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that Claire could have.",
