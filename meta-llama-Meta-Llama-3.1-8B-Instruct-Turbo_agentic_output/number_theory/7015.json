    "solution": "$n^3 \\equiv 888 \\pmod{1000} \\implies n^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ and $n^3 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125}$. $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$ due to the last digit of $n^3$. Let $n = 5a + 2$. By expanding, $125a^3 + 150a^2 + 60a + 8 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125} \\implies 5a^2 + 12a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$.\nBy looking at the last digit again, we see $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod5$, so we let $a = 5a_1 + 3$ where $a_1 \\in \\mathbb{Z^+}$. Plugging this in to $5a^2 + 12a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$ gives $10a_1 + 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$. Obviously, $a_1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$, so we let $a_1 = 5a_2 + 2$ where $a_2$ can be any non-negative integer.\nTherefore, $n = 2 + 5(3+ 5(2+5a_2)) = 125a_2 + 67$. $n^3$ must also be a multiple of $8$, so $n$ must be even. $125a_2 + 67 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2 \\implies a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Therefore, $a_2 = 2a_3 + 1$, where $a_3$ is any non-negative integer. The number $n$ has form $125(2a_3+1)+67 = 250a_3+192$. So the minimum $n = \\boxed{192}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll consider how the last three digits of a cube are affected by the last three digits of the original number. \n\nStep 1: Since we want the cube to end in $888$, we will focus on the last three digits, which is $888$. We'll consider a three-digit number $xyz$, where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are its hundreds, tens, and units digits, respectively. We'll examine the last three digits of the cube $x^3 + y^3 + z^3$.\nStep 2: We notice that $888 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$ and $888 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, implying that the original number must also be even, so $z$ is even. Furthermore, since $888 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$ and $x + y + z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$, we have $x + y + z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$.\nStep 3: Since $z$ is even, we can let $z=2$ or $z=4$ or $z=6$ or $z=8$. We'll check these cases to see which one will lead to the last three digits of a cube being $888$.\nStep 4: We continue with the case where $z=2$. In this case, we need $x^3 + y^3 + 8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$ and $x^3 + y^3 + 8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$. Since $x^3 + y^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$ (as we've already established that $x^3 + y^3$ ends in $0$), we can simplify this to $x^3 + y^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$, or equivalently, $x + y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$. We want to find all pairs of digits $(x,y)$ such that $x + y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$ and $x^3 + y^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$, which will allow us to narrow down the possible values for $x$ and $y$.\n\nNow to test which pair (x,y) such that $x + y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$ we will take x=4, and y\nGiven that we have chosen x=4, we need to find a value of y such that y + 4 \u2261 0 (mod 9) and x^3 + y^3 \u2261 0 (mod 8), which simplifies to 4^3 + y^3 \u2261 0 (mod 8). Since 4^3 = 64, we are looking for a number y^3 such that 64 + y^3 \u2261 0 (mod 8), or equivalently, y^3 \u2261 4 (mod 8). We can test different values of y to see if any satisfy this condition.\nStep 5: \nNow that we have chosen $x=4$, we need to find a value of $y$ such that $y + 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$ and $4^3 + y^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$, which simplifies to $y^3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$. We can test different values of $y$ to see if any satisfy this condition. By testing $y = 2, 4, 6, 8$, we find that $y = 6$ satisfies the condition $y^3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$, as $6^3 = 216 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$ is not correct, but y = 6 is the only other even digit left to test.\nStep 6: We have found that $x = 4$ and $y = 6$ satisfy the conditions. Now we need to determine the value of $z$, which we have already assumed to be $2$ (even). Thus, the smallest three-digit number whose cube ends in $888$ is $466$. However, we need to check if there are other possibilities. Since we're looking for the smallest positive integer whose cube ends in $888$, we need to consider all possible values of $x$, $y$, and $z$.\nSince we have found that $x = 4$ and $y = 6$ satisfy the conditions, we now need to check if this is the smallest possible solution. We need to consider all other possible combinations of $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy the conditions $x + y + z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$ and $z$ even.\n\nTo do this, we can try different values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy $x + y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$, and then check if the resulting value of $z$ is even and leads to a cube ending in $888$.\nStep 7: \nWe will test other pairs of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy $x + y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$. If we let $x=1$, then $y$ must be $8$ since $1+8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$. However, $1^3 + 8^3 = 1 + 512 = 513 \\pmod{1000}$, which does not end in $888$. If we let $x=7$, then $y$ must be $2$ since $7+2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$. However, $7^3 + 2^3 = 343 + 8 = 351 \\pmod{1000}$, which also does not end in $888$. If we let $x=5$, then $y$ must be $4$ since $5+4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$. However, $5^3 + 4^3 = 125 + 64 = 189 \\pmod{1000}$, which does not end in $888$. We continue this process to check for\nStep 8: \nWe will continue to test other pairs of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy $x + y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$. If we let $x=0$, then $y$ must be $9$ since $0+9 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$. However, $0^3 + 9^3 = 9 + 729 = 738 \\pmod{1000}$, which does not end in $888$. If we let $x=9$, then $y$ must be $0$ since $9+0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$. However, $9^3 + 0^3 = 729 \\pmod{1000}$, which does not end in $888$.",
