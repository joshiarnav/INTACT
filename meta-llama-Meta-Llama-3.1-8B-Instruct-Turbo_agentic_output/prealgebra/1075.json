    "problem": "There is a committee composed of eight women and two men. When they meet, they sit in a row---the women in indistinguishable rocking chairs and the men on indistinguishable stools.  How many distinct ways are there for me to arrange the eight chairs and two stools for a meeting?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Because the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from each other and the stools are indistinguishable from each other, we can think of first placing the two stools somewhere in the ten slots and then filling the rest with rocking chairs. The first stool has $10$ slots in which it can go, and the second has $9$. However, because they are indistinguishable from each other, we have overcounted the number of ways to place the stools by a factor of $2$, so we divide by $2$. Thus, there are $\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = \\boxed{45}$ distinct ways to arrange the ten chairs and stools for a meeting.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of combinations with repetitions. The first step is to:\n\n1. Determine the total number of objects to be arranged, which is the sum of the number of women and the number of men: \n   Total objects = 8 (women) + 2 (men) = 10\n2. Calculate the number of ways to arrange these objects, which is a combination problem. Since the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from one another, and the stools are indistinguishable from one another, we are essentially choosing 2 positions out of 10 to be the stools (or equivalently, choosing 8 positions for the rocking chairs). This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\n   C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) \n\n   In this case, n = 10 (total objects) and k = 2 (number of stools to place).\n3. Calculate the combination using the formula: C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!) = 10! / (2!8!) = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1) = 45\n4. Since we are arranging the objects in a row, the order of the women and men does not matter. Therefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the chairs and stools is equal to the number of ways to choose the positions for the stools, which is 45.\nSince the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from one another, and the stools are indistinguishable from one another, there is only one way to arrange the women and men in each distinct seating arrangement. Therefore, the total number of distinct ways to arrange the chairs and stools is equal to the number of ways to choose the positions for the stools, which is 45.\n\n$\\boxed{45}$",
