    "problem": "What is the number of square meters in the area of a circle with diameter 4 meters? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "A circle's radius is half its diameter, so if the diameter of a circle is 4 meters, then its radius is 2 meters.  The area of the circle is $\\pi(\\text{radius})^2=\\pi(2\\text{ m})^2=\\boxed{4\\pi}$ square meters.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the area of a circle. \n\nStep 1: Recall the formula for the area of a circle, which is $\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.\nStep 2: Since the diameter of the circle is given, we need to find the radius first. The radius is half of the diameter, so the radius $r$ is $\\frac{4}{2} = 2$ meters.\nStep 3: Substitute the radius into the formula for the area of a circle. The area is $\\pi r^2 = \\pi (2)^2 = 4\\pi$ square meters.\nStep 4: Therefore, the area of the circle with a diameter of 4 meters is $\\boxed{4\\pi}$ square meters.",
