    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "When we write $\\frac{5}{33}$ as a decimal using long division, we get $0.\\overline{15}=0.15151515\\ldots$. Notice the pattern we have here: if $n$ is odd, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal point is $1$; if $n$ is even, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal place is $5$. Since $92$ is an even number, the digit at the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point is $\\boxed{5}.$",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, first convert $\\frac{5}{33}$ to decimal form by performing long division.\nThe next step is to identify the repeating pattern of digits after the decimal point and determine the position of the 92nd place within that pattern.\nIdentify that $\\frac{5}{33}$ is equal to $0.151515...$. The repeating pattern is \"15\" and it has a length of 2 digits. To find the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point, divide 92 by 2, which gives a quotient of 46 with no remainder, indicating that the 92nd place is the last digit in the 46th repetition of the pattern \"15\".\nSince the 92nd place is the last digit in the 46th repetition of the pattern \"15\", we can conclude that it is the digit 5 in the 46th repetition of \"15\".\nSince the 92nd place is the last digit in the 46th repetition of the pattern \"15\", the digit in the 92nd place is the last digit of the repeating block, which is 5.\nThe final step is to conclude that the digit in the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point is 5. \n\n$\\boxed{5}$",
