Since $x = \\tan x + k\\pi$, we can first find the range of $\\tan x$ by subtracting $k\\pi$ from each part of the inequality, yielding $-k\\pi \\le \\tan x \\le 942 - k\\pi$.\nStep 3: \nWe need to find the range of $k$ that satisfies the inequality $-k\\pi \\le \\tan x \\le 942 - k\\pi$. Since $\\tan x > 0$ for $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and we know that $\\tan \\theta > \\theta$ for $0 < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have $x < \\tan x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ for $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. This implies that $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} < -x < 0$ and $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.
