    "problem": "What is the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "From the information given, we have $x^2 = 2x + 48$. Rearranging, we get $x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$, which we can factor as $(x+6)(x-8) = 0$. Therefore, $x = -6\\text{ or }8$.  Since we want the lesser, $\\boxed{-6}$ is our answer.",

    "model_solution": "Let's start by setting up an equation for the problem. \n\nLet x be the least integer. \n\nWe are given that the square of x is 48 more than its double, so we can write the equation as: \nx^2 = 2x + 48\n\nThis is the equation we will work with in the next step.\nTo solve the equation x^2 = 2x + 48, we need to rearrange it into a quadratic equation in standard form. \n\nFirst, let's move all the terms to one side of the equation: \nx^2 - 2x - 48 = 0\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -2, and c = -48.\n\nNext step is to solve this quadratic equation. We can do this by factoring the equation, using the quadratic formula, or completing the square. \n\nLet's use factoring to solve this quadratic equation. We need to find two numbers whose product is -48 (ac) and whose sum is -2 (b). These numbers are -8 and 6, because -8 * 6 = -48 and -8 + 6 = -2.\n\nSo, we can factor the quadratic equation as: \n(x - 8)(x + 6) = 0\n\nNow, we can use the zero-product property to solve for x: \nx - 8 = 0 or x + 6 = 0\n\nSolving for x\nNow that we have the factored form of the equation (x - 8)(x + 6) = 0 and the two possible solutions (x - 8 = 0 or x + 6 = 0), we can solve for x.\n\nLet's solve the first equation: \nx - 8 = 0\nAdding 8 to both sides gives us: \nx = 8\n\nNow, let's solve the second equation: \nx + 6 = 0\nSubtracting 6 from both sides gives us: \nx = -6\n\nSince we are looking for the least integer, we choose the smallest value of x, which is x = -6.\n\nTherefore, the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double is $\\boxed{-6}$.",
