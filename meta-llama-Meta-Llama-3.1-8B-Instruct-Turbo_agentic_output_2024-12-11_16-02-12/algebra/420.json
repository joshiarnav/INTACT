    "model_solution": "To simplify $5(3-i)+3i(5-i)$, we start by distributing the terms inside the parentheses. \n\nFirst step: Distribute 5 to the terms inside the first parentheses and distribute 3i to the terms inside the second parentheses. \n\nThis gives us: \n$15 - 5i + 15i - 3i^2$\nTo simplify the expression, we will combine like terms. \n\nFirst, let's simplify the term with i^2. We know that i^2 is equal to -1. \n\nSo, -3i^2 becomes -3(-1) which is 3.\n\nNow, our expression is: \n$15 - 5i + 15i + 3$\n\nNext, we will combine the like terms. The like terms in this case are the imaginary terms (-5i and 15i) and the real terms (15 and 3). \n\nThe sum of -5i and 15i is 10i.\n\nThe sum of 15 and 3 is 18.\n\nSo, the simplified expression is: \n$18 + 10i$\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n$\\boxed{18+10i}$",
