    "problem": "Alex has 12 friends and 63 coins. What is the minimum number of additional coins he needs so that he can give each friend at least one coin and no two friends receive the same number of coins?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Alex wants to minimize the number of coins he gives to his friends without giving any two of them the same number of coins. The minimum number of coins he can give to a friend is 1. He then gives 2 coins to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 12. The total number of coins Alex has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+12 = \\frac{12 \\cdot 13}{2}=78$.  Thus, Alex needs $78-63=\\boxed{15}$ more coins.",

    "model_solution": "To find the minimum number of additional coins Alex needs, we need to determine the minimum total coins required to distribute them uniquely among his 12 friends.\n\nStep 1: Find the minimum total coins required by summing up the unique number of coins given to each friend. \n\nSince we want to give each friend a unique number of coins, we can start with 1 coin for the first friend, 2 for the second, 3 for the third, and so on until the 12th friend. \n\nThis can be calculated as: \n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 78\n\nSince 78 is greater than 63, Alex will need at least 15 more coins to meet this condition.\nTo find the minimum number of additional coins Alex needs, we need to determine the difference between the minimum total coins required and the coins he already has.\n\nStep 2: Find the difference between the minimum total coins required and the coins Alex already has.\n\nMinimum total coins required = 78\nCoins Alex already has = 63\n\nMinimum additional coins required = Minimum total coins required - Coins Alex already has\nMinimum additional coins required = 78 - 63\nMinimum additional coins required = 15\n\n$\\boxed{15}$",
