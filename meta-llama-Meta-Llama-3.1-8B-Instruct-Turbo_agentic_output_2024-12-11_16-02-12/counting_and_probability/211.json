    "solution": "In this set of integers, there are 5 tens digits: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.  If 5 integers all have different tens digits, then there must be exactly one integer among the 5 with each tens digit.  Since there are 10 different integers for each tens digit, the number of ways to pick, without regard to order, 5 different integers with different tens digits is $10^5$.  The total number of combinations of 5 integers is $\\binom{50}{5}$.  So the probability that 5 integers drawn all have the different tens digits is $$ \\frac{10^5}{\\binom{50}{5}} = \\frac{100000}{2118760} = \\boxed{\\frac{2500}{52969}}. $$",

We need to choose 5 integers out of these 50.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 5 integers out of 50 without considering order (combinations) can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items being chosen.\n\nFor this problem:\nn = 50 (total number of integers)\nr = 5 (number of integers being chosen)\n\nSo, we need to calculate: \n50C5 = 50! / (5! * (50-5)!)\nTo find the number of ways to choose 5 integers out of 50 without considering order (combinations), we will calculate:\n\n50C5 = 50! / (5! * (50-5)!)\n\nFirst, we can simplify (50-5):\n50 - 5 = 45\n\nNow, we'll simplify the combination formula:\n\n50C5 = 50! / (5! * 45!)\n\nNext, we can simplify the factorials:\n- 50! can be written as 50 * 49 * 48 * 47 * 46 * 45!\n- 5! is already simplified (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n- 45! cancels out with part of 50! (leaving 50 * 49 * 48 * 47 * 46)\n\nNow we have:\n50C5 = (50 * 49 * 48 * 47 * 46) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n50 * 49 = 2450\n2450 * 48 = 117600\n117600 * 47 = 5539200\n553920\nTo continue with the calculation:\n\nNow we have:\n50C5 = 5539200 / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nNow we'll simplify the denominator:\n5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\n\nNow we have:\n50C5 = 5539200 / 120\n\nNow we'll calculate the value:\n5539200 / 120 = 46,080\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 5 integers out of 50 without considering order (combinations) is 46,080.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to choose 5 integers with different tens digits.\n\nThere are 5 possible tens digits: 20, 30, 40, 50, 60.\n\nWe need to choose 5 integers, each with a different tens digit. We can choose 1 integer from each tens digit group.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 1 integer from the 20s: 10 (20-29 inclusive)\nNumber of ways to choose 1 integer from the 30s: 10 (30-39 inclusive)\nNumber of ways to choose 1 integer from the 40s:\nTo find the number of ways to choose 1 integer from the 40s, we need to consider the numbers between 40 and 49 inclusive.
