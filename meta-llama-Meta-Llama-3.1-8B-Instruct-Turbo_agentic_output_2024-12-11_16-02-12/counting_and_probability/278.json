    "problem": "After a gymnastics meet, each gymnast shook hands once with every gymnast on every team (except herself). Afterwards, a coach came down and only shook hands with each gymnast from her own team. There were a total of 281 handshakes. What is the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in?",

    "solution": "The number of gymnasts is some integer $n$, so that the number of gymnast-gymnast handshakes is ${n \\choose 2}$ for some $n$. Also, the coach must participate in an integer $k<n$ number of handshakes. So, ${n \\choose 2} + k = 281$. If we want to minimize $k$, we need the maximal $n$ such that ${n \\choose 2} \\le 281$, which implies $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 281$ or $n^2 - n - 562 \\le 0 $. So, the maximal $n$ is 24. So, $k = 281 - {24 \\choose 2} = 281 - 12 \\cdot 23 = 281 - 276 = \\boxed{5}$.",

The total number of gymnasts is 'T * G'.\n\nThe total number of handshakes between gymnasts can be calculated using the combination formula since each gymnast shakes hands with every other gymnast.

In this case, 'T * G - 1' is odd. Since the product of an even number and an odd number is even, 'T * G * (T * G - 1)' is even.\nSince 'T * G * (T * G - 1)' is even, and it's divided by 2, the result is an integer.
