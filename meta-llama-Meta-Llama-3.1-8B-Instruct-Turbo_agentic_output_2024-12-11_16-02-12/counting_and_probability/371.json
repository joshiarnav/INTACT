    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of balls in the different boxes.\n\nThere are $3$ ways to arrange the balls as $(5,0,0)$ (specifically, box 1 can have 5, box 2 can have 5, box 3 can have 5).\n\nThere are $3! = 6$ to arrange $(4,1,0)$ and $3! = 6$ ways to arrange $(3,2,0)$; in each case, we must choose one of the 3 boxes to have the largest number of balls, and also one of the remaining two boxes to be left empty.\n\nHowever, there are only $3$ ways to arrange $(3,1,1)$, and $3$ ways to arrange $(2,2,1)$; in each case, we must choose one box to have the `different' number of balls (3 in the $(3,1,1)$ case and 1 in the $(2,2,1)$ case).\n\nThis gives a total of $3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = \\boxed{21}$ arrangements.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of \"stars and bars\" or \"combinations with repetition.\" The idea is to represent the 5 indistinguishable balls as stars and the 2 dividers between the 3 boxes as bars.\n\nThe first step is to understand the problem and determine the total number of objects (stars and bars). We have:\n\n- 5 indistinguishable balls (stars)\n- 2 dividers between 3 boxes (bars)\n\nSo, we have a total of 5 (stars) + 2 (bars) = 7 objects.\n\nThe next step would be to determine the number of ways to arrange these objects.\nTo find the number of ways to arrange these objects, we can use the concept of combinations with repetition. The formula for this is:\n\nn! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of objects (7 in this case, 5 stars + 2 bars)\n- k is the number of bars (2 in this case, representing the dividers between the boxes)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n7! / (2! * (7-2)!)\n= 7! / (2! * 5!)\n= (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n= (7 * 6) / (2 * 1)\n= 21\n\nHowever, the above formula is used when we have distinct objects. In our case, some of the objects are indistinguishable (the balls), so we need to adjust for overcounting.\n\nTo do this, we can think of the 5 stars as being indistinguishable from one another. The formula for combinations with repetition when some objects\nTo adjust for overcounting, we need to divide the result by the number of ways the 5 indistinguishable balls can be arranged among themselves.\n\nSince the balls are indistinguishable, we can think of them as being identical. The number of ways to arrange these 5 identical balls among themselves is simply 1, since they are all the same.\n\nHowever, we need to consider that the 3 boxes are also indistinguishable. The problem asks us to find the number of ways to put 5 balls in 3 boxes, not 3 specific boxes, but 3 boxes in general. This means we need to divide by the number of ways the boxes can be arranged, which is 3!.\n\nSo, the final formula should be:\n\nn! / (k! * (n-k)!) / (number of ways boxes can be arranged)\n\nWe already calculated the first part of the equation:\n\n7! / (2! * 5!) = 21\n\nNow, we need to divide by the number of ways the boxes can be arranged (3!), which is:\n\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n21 / 6 = 3\nNow that we've adjusted for overcounting by dividing by the number of ways the boxes can be arranged (3!), the final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{3}$",
