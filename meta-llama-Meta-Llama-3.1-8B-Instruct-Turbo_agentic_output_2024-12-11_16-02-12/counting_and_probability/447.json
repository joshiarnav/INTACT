    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",
