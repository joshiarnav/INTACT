    "problem": "Seven teams play a soccer tournament in which each team plays every other team exactly once. No ties occur, each team has a $50\\%$ chance of winning each game it plays, and the outcomes of the games are independent. In each game, the winner is awarded a point and the loser gets 0 points. The total points are accumilated to decide the ranks of the teams. In the first game of the tournament, team $A$ beats team $B.$ The probability that team $A$ finishes with more points than team $B$ is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$\n",

    "solution": "The results of the five remaining games are independent of the first game, so by symmetry, the probability that $A$ scores higher than $B$ in these five games is equal to the probability that $B$ scores higher than $A$. We let this probability be $p$; then the probability that $A$ and $B$ end with the same score in these five games is $1-2p$.\nOf these three cases ($|A| > |B|, |A| < |B|, |A|=|B|$), the last is the easiest to calculate (see solution 2 for a way to directly calculate the other cases).\nThere are ${5\\choose k}$ ways to $A$ to have $k$ victories, and ${5\\choose k}$ ways for $B$ to have $k$ victories. Summing for all values of $k$,\n$1-2p = \\frac{1}{2^{5} \\times 2^{5}}\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{5} {5\\choose k}^2\\right) = \\frac{1^2+5^2+10^2+10^2+5^2+1^2}{1024} = \\frac{126}{512}.$\nThus $p = \\frac 12 \\left(1-\\frac{126}{512}\\right) = \\frac{193}{512}$.
