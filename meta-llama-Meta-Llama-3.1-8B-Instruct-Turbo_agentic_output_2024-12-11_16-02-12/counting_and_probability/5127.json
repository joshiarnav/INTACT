    "problem": "A mother purchases 5 blue plates, 2 red plates, 2 green plates, and 1 orange plate. How many ways are there for her to arrange these plates for dinner around her circular table if she doesn't want the 2 green plates to be adjacent?\n",

    "solution": "We apply the complement principle: we find the total number of cases in which the 2 green places are adjacent, and subtract from the total number of cases.\nThere are $\\frac{10!}{5!2!2!1!} = 7560$ ways to arrange the plates in a linear fashion. However, since the plates are arranged in a circle, there are $10$ ways to rotate the plates, and so there are $7560/10 = 756$ ways to arrange the plates in a circular fashion (consider, for example, fixing the orange plate at the top of the table).\nIf the two green plates are adjacent, we may think of them as a single entity, so that there are now $9$ objects to be placed around the table in a circular fashion. Using the same argument, there are $\\frac{9!}{5!2!1!1!} = 1512$ ways to arrange the objects in a linear fashion, and $1512/9 = 168$ ways in a circular fashion.\nThus, the answer is $756 - 168 = \\boxed{588}$.",

This is because we have 5 identical blue plates, 2 identical red plates, 2 identical green plates, and 1 unique orange plate.\n\nHowever, since the plates are arranged in a circle, we divide the result by P (since a circular permutation has (P-1) rotations that are considered the same arrangement).\n\nSo, the total number of ways to arrange the plates in a circular manner is:\n(P-1)! * P! / (5! * 2! * 2! * 1!)\n= 9! * 10! / (5! * 2! * 2! * 1!)\n\nThis is our initial total, before considering the restriction about the green plates.\nTo solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.\n\nThe initial total number of ways to arrange the plates in a circular manner, without any restrictions, is:\n(P-1)! * P! / (5! * 2! * 2! * 1!)\n= 9! * 10! / (5! * 2! * 2! * 1!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of 9! * 10! / (5! * 2! * 2! * 1!):\n9! = 362,880\n10! = 3,628,800\n5! = 120\n2! = 2\n2! = 2\n1! = 1\n\nNow, let's substitute these values:\n(9! * 10!) / (5! * 2! * 2! * 1!)\n= (362,880 * 3,628,800) / (120 * 2 * 2 * 1)\n= (1,315,392,640,000) / (480)\n= 2,735,824,000\n\nSo, the initial total number of ways to arrange the plates\nTo find the total number of ways to arrange the plates with the restriction that the 2 green plates are not adjacent, we can use the concept of complementary counting. \n\nThis means we first find the total number of ways to arrange the plates with the 2 green plates adjacent, and then subtract this from the total number of ways to arrange the plates without any restrictions.\n\nWhen the 2 green plates are adjacent, we can treat them as a single unit.

Since the total number of ways to arrange the plates without any restrictions is the sum of the total number of ways to arrange the plates with the 2 green plates adjacent and the total number of ways to arrange the plates with the 2 green plates not adjacent, we can set up the following equation:\n\nTotal number of ways without any restrictions = Total number of ways with adjacent green plates + Total number of ways with the 2 green plates not adjacent\n\nWe know the total number of ways without any restrictions (2,735,824,000) and the total number of ways with adjacent green plates (which needs to be recalculated correctly).
