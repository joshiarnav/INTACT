    "solution": "Florida issues license plates in which the first three and last slots are filled with letters, and the fourth and fifth are filled with digits. Thus, there are $26^4 \\cdot 10^2$ Florida license plates possible. North Dakota, however, issues license plates in which the first three slots are filled with letters and the last three slots are filled with digits. There are thus $26^3 \\cdot 10^3$ possible North Dakota license plates. Multiplying these out and taking the difference yields an answer of $\\boxed{28121600}$.",

Then there are 10 possibilities for each of the 2 numbers, giving us $10^2$. Finally, there are 26 possibilities for the last letter, giving us $26$. \n\nSo the total number of possible license plates for Florida is: \n\n$26^3 * 10^2 * 26$\nTo find the total number of possible license plates for Florida, we multiply the number of possibilities for each position:\n\n$26^3 * 10^2 * 26$\n\nFirst, let's calculate $26^3$, which is $26 * 26 * 26 = 17576$.\n\nNext, we'll calculate $10^2$, which is $10 * 10 = 100$.\n\nNow, we'll multiply the results together: $17576 * 100 = 1757600$.\n\nFinally, we'll multiply the result by 26: $1757600 * 26 = 45689600$.\n\nSo the total number of possible license plates for Florida is 45,689,600.\n\nWe'll follow the same process for North Dakota, which has a format with 3 letters, then 3 numbers, and then 2 letters.\n\nThere are 26 possibilities for each of the 3 letters in the first part of the license plate, giving us $26^3$.
