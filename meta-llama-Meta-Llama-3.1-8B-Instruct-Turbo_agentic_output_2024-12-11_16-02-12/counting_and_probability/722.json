    "solution": "We have two cases because if the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$, it could be an ace or not be an ace.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{3}{51} = \\dfrac{1}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the three remaining aces, which gives a probability of $\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot \\dfrac{1}{17} = \\dfrac{1}{884}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{12}{52} = \\dfrac{3}{13}$ chance that a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the ace is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{4}{51}$ chance that an ace is drawn second, giving a $\\dfrac{3}{13}\\cdot \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{4}{221}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nSo the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\\dfrac{1}{884} + \\dfrac{4}{221} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}$.\n\nNotice that we can avoid some of the large denominators above by organizing this computation as follows: $$\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{3}{51}+\\dfrac{12}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{1\\cdot 3+12\\cdot 4}{52\\cdot 51} = \\dfrac{51}{52\\cdot 51}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}.$$",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace, we need to break down the problem into two parts.\n\nFirst, the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$.\n\nThere are 52 cards in a standard deck, and 13 of them are $\\diamondsuit$ cards (Ace of $\\diamondsuit$, 2 of $\\diamondsuit$, 3 of $\\diamondsuit$, 4 of $\\diamondsuit$, 5 of $\\diamondsuit$, 6 of $\\diamondsuit$, 7 of $\\diamondsuit$, 8 of $\\diamondsuit$, 9 of $\\diamondsuit$, 10 of $\\diamondsuit$, Jack of $\\diamondsuit$, Queen of $\\diamondsuit$, and King of $\\diamondsuit$). \n\nSo the probability of drawing a $\\diamondsuit$ card first is 13/52, which can be simplified to 1/4. \n\nNow, we need to consider two cases for the second card: \n\n1. The first card is the Ace of $\\diamondsuit$, and \n2. The first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the Ace of $\\diamondsuit$.\n\nWe will consider these cases separately.\nTo find the overall probability, we need to calculate the probability of each case and then sum them up.\n\n**Case 1: The first card is the Ace of $\\diamondsuit$**\n\nIn this case, there are 51 cards remaining in the deck and only 3 aces (one of which is already drawn as the first card). So, the probability of drawing an ace as the second card is 3/51, which can be simplified to 1/17.\n\nThe probability of the first card being the Ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is 1/52, since there is only one Ace of $\\diamondsuit$ in the deck.\n\nTherefore, the probability of this case is (1/52) * (1/17) = 1/884.\n\n**Case 2: The first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the Ace of $\\diamondsuit$**\n\nIn this case, there are 51 cards remaining in the deck and 4 aces (none of which have been drawn yet). So, the probability of drawing an ace as the second card is 4/51.\n\nThe probability of the first card being a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the Ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is 12\nTo find the probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace, we need to calculate the probability for both cases and sum them up.\n\nFor Case 1: The first card is the Ace of $\\diamondsuit$\nThe probability of the first card being the Ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is 1/52.\nThe probability of drawing an ace as the second card is 3/51.\nTherefore, the probability of this case is (1/52) * (3/51) = 3/2652.\n\nFor Case 2: The first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the Ace of $\\diamondsuit$\nThe probability of the first card being a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the Ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is 12/52.\nThe probability of drawing an ace as the second card is 4/51.\nTherefore, the probability of this case is (12/52) * (4/51) = 48/1368.\n\nNow, we sum up the probabilities of both cases to find the overall probability:\n(3/2652) + (48/1368) = (3/2652) + (96/2652) =\nTo sum up the probabilities of both cases, we need to have a common denominator, which is 2652.
