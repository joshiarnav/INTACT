    "solution": "The major diagonal has a length of $\\sqrt{3}$.  The volume of the pyramid is $1/6$, and so its height $h$ satisfies $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot h\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(\\sqrt{2})^2=1/6$ since  the freshly cut face is an equilateral triangle of side length $\\sqrt{2}$.

The unit cube has vertices at (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), and (1,1,1). \n\n2. When the corner is chopped off, we are essentially cutting through the three vertices (1,1,0), (1,0,1), and (0,1,1). \n\n3. This cut creates a triangular pyramid with one vertex at the cut corner (1,1,1), and three other vertices at (1,1,0), (1,0,1), and (0,1,1).\n\nThe freshly-cut face is a triangle, and we can find its area to proceed with the solution.\nTo find the area of the freshly-cut face, we first need to determine the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n\nThe vertices of the triangle are (1,1,0), (1,0,1), and (0,1,1). \n\nWe can find the lengths of the sides by calculating the distance between each pair of vertices.\n\nLet's calculate the distance between (1,1,0) and (1,0,1):\n\nDistance = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 + (z2-z1)^2)\n= sqrt((1-1)^2 + (0-1)^2 + (1-0)^2)\n= sqrt(0 + 1 + 1)\n= sqrt(2)\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance between (1,0,1) and (0,1,1):\n\nDistance = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 + (z2-z1)^2)\n= sqrt((0-1)^2 + (1-0)^2 + (1-1)^2)\n= sqrt(1 + 1 + 0)\n= sqrt(2)\n\nFinally, let\nWe have calculated the lengths of the sides of the triangle. Since all three sides are equal to sqrt(2), this is an equilateral triangle.\n\nNow, let's find the area of the triangle. The area of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (\u221a3)/4 \u00d7 side\u00b2\n\nSubstituting the value of the side, we get:\n\nArea = (\u221a3)/4 \u00d7 (\u221a2)\u00b2\n= (\u221a3)/4 \u00d7 2\n= (\u221a3)\n\nNow that we have the area of the freshly-cut face, we know that the volume of the triangular pyramid is one-third of the area of the base (the freshly-cut face) times the height of the pyramid.\n\nThe height of the pyramid can be calculated by finding the distance from the vertex (1,1,1) to the plane formed by the three vertices (1,1,0), (1,0,1), and (0,1,1).\n\nHowever, there's an easier way to approach this problem. We can consider the triangular pyramid as a tetrahedron with a base area of (\u221a3) and a height h, and a volume of (1/3) *\nWe can find the height of the remaining cube when the freshly-cut face is placed on a table by analyzing the problem in a different way.\n\nConsider the unit cube with a corner chopped off. The volume of the original cube is 1^3 = 1.\n\nThe volume of the chopped-off triangular pyramid (or tetrahedron) is given by the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base area * height\n\nWe know that the base area of the triangular pyramid is (\u221a3), and the volume of the pyramid is (1/3) * (\u221a3) * h. However, this is the volume of the pyramid removed from the cube, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n1 - (1/3) * (\u221a3) * h = 1 - (1/3) * (\u221a3) * (h/\u221a3) * \u221a3\n\nSince the volume removed from the cube is a pyramid, we can find the remaining volume by subtracting the volume of the pyramid from the original cube. \n\nSince the chopped-off corner is 1/3 of the cube's volume, the remaining cube's volume is 2/3 of the original cube's volume. \n\nSo\nNow that we have the volume of the remaining cube, we need to find the height of the remaining cube.\n\nWe know that the volume of the remaining cube is (2/3) * 1^3 = (2/3).\n\nSince the volume of a cube is given by V = s^3, where s is the side length, we can find the side length of the remaining cube by taking the cube root of the volume:\n\ns = \u221b(2/3)\n\nHowever, we are looking for the height of the remaining cube, not the side length. Since the freshly-cut face is placed on a table, the height of the remaining cube is the distance from the freshly-cut face to the opposite corner of the cube.\n\nTo find this distance, we can analyze the problem geometrically. The unit cube has a side length of 1, and the freshly-cut face is an equilateral triangle with side length \u221a2. \n\nSince the freshly-cut face is placed on a table, the distance from the freshly-cut face to the opposite corner of the cube is the distance from the center of the freshly-cut face to the opposite corner of the cube, minus the distance from the center of the freshly-cut face to its edge.\n\nThe\nTo find the height of the remaining cube, we need to find the distance from the center of the freshly-cut face to the opposite corner of the cube.\n\nThe center of the freshly-cut face can be found by averaging the coordinates of the three vertices of the face. Since the coordinates of the vertices are (1,1,0), (1,0,1), and (0,1,1), the center of the face is at (1, 1/2, 1/2).\n\nThe distance from the center of the face to the opposite corner of the cube can be found by subtracting the coordinates of the center of the face from the coordinates of the opposite corner of the cube, and then taking the magnitude of the resulting vector.\n\nHowever, since the freshly-cut face is an equilateral triangle, we can use a simpler method to find the distance. We can find the distance from the center of the face to the opposite corner of the cube by finding the height of the equilateral triangle and adding it to the distance from the center of the face to its edge.\n\nThe height of an equilateral triangle can be found by dividing the side length by \u221a3. Since the side length of the freshly-cut face is \u221a2\nTo find the distance from the center of the freshly-cut face to the opposite corner of the cube, we can use the fact that the center of the face is at (1, 1/2, 1/2). We can then find the distance from this point to the opposite corner of the cube by subtracting the coordinates of the center of the face from the coordinates of the opposite corner of the cube.\n\nThe coordinates of the opposite corner of the cube are (1,1,1), and the coordinates of the center of the face are (1, 1/2, 1/2). The distance from the center of the face to the opposite corner of the cube is then:\n\nDistance = \u221a((1-1)^2 + (1-1/2)^2 + (1-1/2)^2)\n= \u221a((0)^2 + (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2)\n= \u221a(0 + 1/4 + 1/4)\n= \u221a(1/2)\n\nHowever, we need to add the distance from the center of the face to its edge to find the height of the remaining cube. Since the distance from the center of the face to its\nSince the freshly-cut face is an equilateral triangle with side length \u221a2, and the height of an equilateral triangle can be found by dividing the side length by \u221a3, we can find the height of the triangle as:\n\nh = (\u221a2)/\u221a3\n\nHowever, this is the height of the equilateral triangle, and we need to add the distance from the center of the face to its edge to find the height of the remaining cube. \n\nSince the distance from the center of the face to its edge is half of the side length of the triangle, and the side length of the triangle is \u221a2, the distance from the center of the face to its edge is:\n\nd = (\u221a2)/2\n\nNow, we can add the height of the equilateral triangle and the distance from the center of the face to its edge to find the height of the remaining cube:\n\nHeight = h + d\n= (\u221a2)/\u221a3 + (\u221a2)/2\n\nTo add these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. Since the denominators are \u221a3 and 2, the least common multiple is 2\u221a3.\n\nHeight = (\u221a2)/\u221a3 \u00d7 (2\u221a3)/(2\nTo add these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 2\u221a3. \n\nFirst, we can rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:\n\n(\u221a2)/\u221a3 = (\u221a2)(2\u221a3)/\u221a3(2\u221a3)\n= 2\u221a6/2\u221a3\n= \u221a6/\u221a3\n\nAnd:\n(\u221a2)/2 = (\u221a2)(\u221a3)/(2)(\u221a3)\n= \u221a6/2\n\nNow, we can add the two fractions with the common denominator 2\u221a3:\n\nHeight = (\u221a6/\u221a3) + (\u221a6/2)\n= (\u221a6/\u221a3) + (\u221a6/2) \u00d7 (\u221a3/\u221a3)\n= (\u221a6/\u221a3) + (\u221a18)/(2\u221a3)\n= (\u221a6)(2\u221a3)/(\u221a3)(2\u221a3) + (\u221a18)/(2\u221a3)\n= 2\u221a18/6 + \u221a18/2\u221a3\n= 2\u221a18/6 + \u221a18/(2\u221a3) \u00d7 (3/3)\n= 2\u221a18/6 + 3\u221a18/(2\u221a3)(\nTo add these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 2\u221a3. \n\nFirst, we can rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:\n\n(\u221a2)/\u221a3 = (\u221a2)(2\u221a3)/\u221a3(2\u221a3)\n= 2\u221a6/2\u221a3\n= \u221a6/\u221a3\n\nAnd:\n(\u221a2)/2 = (\u221a2)(\u221a3)/(2)(\u221a3)\n= \u221a6/2\n\nNow, we can add the two fractions with the common denominator 2\u221a3:\n\nHeight = (\u221a6/\u221a3) + (\u221a6/2)\n= (\u221a6/\u221a3) + (\u221a6/2) \u00d7 (\u221a3/\u221a3)\n= (\u221a6/\u221a3) + (\u221a18)/(2\u221a3)\n= (\u221a6)(2\u221a3)/(\u221a3)(2\u221a3) + (\u221a18)/(2\u221a3)\n= 2\u221a18/6 + \u221a18/(2\u221a3)\n= 2\u221a18/6 + \u221a18/2\u221a3 \u00d7 (\u221a3/\u221a3)\n= 2\u221a18/6 + (\u221a18 \u00d7 \u221a3)/(2",

However, this is the volume of the pyramid removed from the cube, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n1 - (1/3) * (\u221a3) * h = 1 - (1/3) * (\u221a3) * (h/\u221a3) * \u221a3\n\nSince the volume removed from the cube is a pyramid, we can find the remaining volume by subtracting the volume of the pyramid from the original cube. \n\nSince the chopped-off corner is 1/3 of the cube's volume, the remaining cube's volume is 2/3 of the original cube's volume. \n\nSo",

Since the freshly-cut face is placed on a table, the height of the remaining cube is the distance from the freshly-cut face to the opposite corner of the cube.\n\nTo find this distance, we can analyze the problem geometrically.
