    "solution": "At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{2}{3}(360^\\circ)=240$ degrees.  Every minute, the minute hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}(360^\\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12} (360^\\circ)=0.5$ degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.  After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\\circ-5.5^\\circ\\cdot 15=\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of degrees in the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock at 8:15, we first need to understand the movement of the hour and minute hands. \n\nThe hour hand moves 360\u00b0 in 12 hours or 30\u00b0 in 1 hour. It also moves as the minutes pass, so its movement can be calculated as 0.5\u00b0 per minute.\n\nThe minute hand moves 360\u00b0 in 60 minutes, which is 6\u00b0 per minute.\n\nNow, let's calculate the position of the hour hand at 8:15.\nTo find the position of the hour hand at 8:15, we need to consider its movement over the hour and the additional movement due to the 15 minutes.\n\nFor the hour movement, the hour hand moves 30\u00b0 in 1 hour. Since it is 8:15, the hour hand has moved 8 * 30\u00b0 in 8 hours and an additional 15 * 0.5\u00b0 due to the 15 minutes.\n\nSo, the total movement of the hour hand due to the hour is 8 * 30\u00b0 = 240\u00b0.\n\nThe additional movement due to the 15 minutes is 15 * 0.5\u00b0 = 7.5\u00b0.\n\nThe total position of the hour hand is then 240\u00b0 + 7.5\u00b0 = 247.5\u00b0.\n\nNow, we need to convert this angle to a position within a 12-hour clock. Since the hour hand starts at 0\u00b0 at 12:00, a position of 247.5\u00b0 corresponds to 3.75 or 3 hours and 45 minutes into the 8-hour period.\n\nHowever, to find the smaller angle between the hour and minute hands, we need to consider the position of\nTo find the position of the minute hand, we can multiply the minutes by the movement per minute, which is 6\u00b0 per minute. \n\nSince it's 8:15, the minute hand has moved 15 * 6\u00b0 = 90\u00b0.\n\nHowever, we don't need to consider the hour movement for the minute hand, as it moves uniformly at 6\u00b0 per minute.\n\nNow, we need to find the smaller angle between the hour hand and the minute hand. \n\nThe hour hand is at 247.5\u00b0, and the minute hand is at 90\u00b0.\n\nTo find the smaller angle, we can subtract the smaller angle from the larger angle. \n\nHowever, we first need to consider which angle is smaller. \n\nIf we subtract 90\u00b0 from 247.5\u00b0, we get 157.5\u00b0. \n\nIf we subtract 247.5\u00b0 from 90\u00b0, we get -157.5\u00b0, which is equivalent to 202.5\u00b0 (360\u00b0 - 157.5\u00b0). \n\nBut since we want the smaller angle, we'll consider 157.5\u00b0 as the smaller angle.\n\nBut the question asks to express the answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth\nHowever, we need to consider the position of the hour hand within the 12-hour clock.

We can subtract 240\u00b0 (8 hours) from 247.5\u00b0, which results in 7.5\u00b0. This position is within the 8-hour period.\n\nWe also need to consider the position of the minute hand, which is at 90\u00b0. We previously calculated that the hour hand is at 247.5\u00b0, and we found that the smaller angle between the two hands is 157.5\u00b0. \n\nSince this is the correct answer, we can express it as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\n\n$\\boxed{157.5}$",
