We will subtract the second equation from the first to obtain the equation $(a+b)d - ac - c - d = 15d - 78$.\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we can factor out $d$ from the first two terms to get $d(a+b) - c(a + 1) = 15d - 78$. Factor the first term on the left side to get $d(a+b) - c(a+1) = d(15) - c(a+1)$ which reduces to $15d - c(a + 1) = 15d - 78$.\n\nWe can then cancel $15d$ from both sides to get $-c(a + 1) = -78$. This simplifies to $-c(a+1) = -78$ or $c(a+1) = 78$.\n\nTo find a relationship between $x$ and $y$, we'll start by multiplying the first equation by $d$ and the second equation by $c$.
