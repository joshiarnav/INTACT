    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "In the rightmost column there is no carrying, so our base must be greater than 5. However, in the next column we see that $6_{b}+3_{b}=11_{b}$. This tells us that $b$ divides into 9 once, with a remainder 1. Therefore, $b=\\boxed{8}$.",
