If $y$ is the percent we want to find, then we can write:\n\n$y\\% \\text{ of }x = 0.2x$\n\nNow convert the percent to a decimal by dividing it by $100$. We get:\n\n$\\frac{y}{100} \\times x = 0.2x$\n\nNow cancel $x$ from both sides of the equation:\nNow, cancel $x$ from both sides of the equation:\n\n$\\frac{y}{100} \\times x = 0.2x$\n\nDivide both sides by $x$:\n\n$\\frac{y}{100} = \\frac{0.2x}{x}$\n\nSince $\\frac{x}{x} = 1$, the equation simplifies to:\n\n$\\frac{y}{100} = 0.2$\n\nNow, multiply both sides by $100$ to isolate $y$:\n\n$y \\times 100 = 0.2 \\times 100$\n\n$y \\times 100 = 20$\n\nDivide both sides by $100$:\n\n$y = \\frac{20}{100}$\n\n$y = 0.2$\n\nTo convert $y$ to a percentage, multiply by $100$:\n\n$y = 0.2 \\times 100$\n\n$y = 20\\%$\n\nSo, $\\boxed{20\\%}$ of $x$ is equal to $40\\%$ of $50\\%$ of $x$.",
