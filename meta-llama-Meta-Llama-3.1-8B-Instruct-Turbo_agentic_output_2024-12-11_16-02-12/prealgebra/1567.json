    "problem": "How many integers between 1 and 200 are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Integers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 must be multiples of 15.  We can start by listing the multiples of 15 between 1 and 200: $$15,30,45,60,75,90,105,120,135,150,165,180,195$$ Checking only the even numbers, we can eliminate those that are multiples of 4, leaving us with: $$15,30,45,75,90,105,135,150,165,195$$ Finally, we need to eliminate any remaining multiples of 7.  The only multiples of 7 we need to be concerned with are those ending in 5 or 0.  The only number on the list that is a multiple of 7 is 105.  Our final list is: $$15,30,45,75,90,135,150,165,195$$ This leaves us with $\\boxed{9}$ integers.",

The LCM of 15 and 4 is 60. \n\nNow, we need to exclude the multiples of 60 from the list of multiples of 15 between 1 and 200.\n\nThe multiples of 60 between 1 and 200 are 60, 120, and 180.\n\nNext, let's exclude the multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 7.\n\nTo do this, we need to find the LCM of 15 and 7. The LCM of 15 and 7 is 105.\n\nNow, we need to exclude the multiples of 105 from the list of multiples of 15 between 1 and 200.\n\nThe multiple of 105 between 1 and 200 is 105.\n\nNow we need to exclude multiples of 15 that are multiples of both 4 and 7.

We have already excluded the multiples of 105 in Step 3.\n\nThe multiples of 105 that we previously excluded are 105.\n\nHowever, we need to check if there are any other multiples of 15 that are also multiples of 7 and are not multiples of 60.\n\nSince the LCM of 60 and 105 is 420, which is greater than 200, the only multiple of 15 that is also a multiple of 7 and is not a multiple of 60 is 105.\n\nTherefore, we have not excluded any additional multiples of 15 between\nSince we've already found that there are 9 multiples of 15 between 1 and 200 that are not multiples of 4 or 7, and we've verified that these 9 multiples are not multiples of 7, we can conclude that there are indeed 9 integers between 1 and 200 that are multiples of both 3 and 5 but not of either 4 or 7.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{9}$",
