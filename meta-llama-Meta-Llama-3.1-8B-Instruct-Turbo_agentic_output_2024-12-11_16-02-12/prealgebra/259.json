    "problem": "A toy store manager received a large order of Mr. Slinkums just in time for the holidays. The manager places $20\\%$ of them on the shelves, leaving the other 120 Mr. Slinkums in storage. How many Mr. Slinkums were in this order?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If $20\\%$ of the toys were put on the shelves, the $80\\%$ of the toys were left in storage.  Therefore, we are given $80\\% T=120$, where $T$ is the number of toys in the order.  Rewriting $80\\%$ as $\\frac{4}{5}$ and multiplying both sides by $\\frac{5}{4}$, we find that $T=120\\cdot\\frac{5}{4}=30\\cdot 5=\\boxed{150}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's denote the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order as x. \n\nStep 1: The manager places $20\\%$ of the Mr. Slinkums on the shelves, which means 80% of the Mr. Slinkums are left in storage. \n\nThe equation can be set up as follows: \n0.8x = 120\nTo find the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order, we need to solve the equation 0.8x = 120.\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 0.8 to isolate x.\n\n0.8x / 0.8 = 120 / 0.8\n\nx = 150\n\nSo, there were $\\boxed{150}$ Mr. Slinkums in the order.",
