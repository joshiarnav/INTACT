    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To round $18.4851$ to the nearest hundredth, we must look at the hundreds and the thousands digits of the number in question. Since the thousands digit ($5$) is greater than or equal to $5$, the hundreds digit $8$ rounds up to $9$. Therefore, $18.4851$ rounded to the nearest hundredth is equal to $\\boxed{18.49}$.",

    "model_solution": "To round to the nearest hundredth, we need to look at the thousandth place (the third digit after the decimal point) which is 5 in this case. \n\nSince the digit in the thousandth place is 5, we will look at the digit in the ten-thousandth place (the fourth digit after the decimal point) which is 1. \n\nBecause the digit in the ten-thousandth place is less than 5, we will round down.\nSince the digit in the ten-thousandth place is less than 5, we will round down. To round down, we will look at the digit in the thousandth place, which is 5. \n\nWe will simply truncate the digit in the thousandth place because it's 5, which is less than or equal to 5. Therefore, the digit in the thousandth place is dropped.\n\nSo, the number 18.4851 will be rounded down to 18.48. \n\n$\\boxed{18.48}$",
