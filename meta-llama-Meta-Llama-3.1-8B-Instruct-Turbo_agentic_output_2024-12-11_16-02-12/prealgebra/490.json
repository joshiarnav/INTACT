    "solution": "Say the radius of the circle is $r$. Then the area of the circle is $\\pi r^2,$ which we estimate to $154=\\frac{22}{7}r^2$. If we multiply both sides by $\\frac{7}{22}$, we get $r^2=49$ or $r=7$. The circle's circumference is $2\\pi r$, which we again estimate to $\\frac{44}{7}r=44$. Vanessa wants two extra inches of ribbon, so she needs to buy $44+2=\\boxed{46}$ inches of ribbon.",

We're given that the area of the circular region is 154 square inches and that she estimates \u03c0 = 22/7.\n\nStep 1: Recall the formula for the area of a circle, which is A = \u03c0r^2, where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle.
