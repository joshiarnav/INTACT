    "model_solution": "To find the vertical asymptote, we need to find the value of x that makes the denominator equal to zero. \n\nWe have the equation $y=\\frac{x+2}{5x-7}$. \n\nSetting the denominator equal to zero, we get:\n\n$5x - 7 = 0$\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n$5x = 7$\n\n$x = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\nTherefore, the vertical asymptote occurs at $x = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{5}}$."
