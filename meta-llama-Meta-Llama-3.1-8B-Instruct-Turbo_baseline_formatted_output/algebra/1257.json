    "problem": "Given that $f(x) = x^k$ where $k < 0$, what is the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$?",
    "solution": "We are looking at the range of $f(x)$ when $x$ is in the interval $[1,\\infty)$. Because $k < 0$, $f(x)$ is decreasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. We see that $f(1) = 1^k = 1$, and as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ approaches 0, but never reaches it.  Hence, on the interval $[1,\\infty)$, $f(x)$ takes on all values between 0 (exclusive) and 1 inclusive, which means the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{(0,1]}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$, we first need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = x^k$ where $k < 0$. \n\nSince $k < 0$, the function is a decreasing function for all $x > 0$, because as $x$ increases, the value of $x^k$ decreases.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval:\n\n$f(1) = 1^k = 1$ (for any $k$, $a^0 = 1$ or $a^b$ where b is a negative number with a positive number to a power of b is also 1) \n$f(\\infty)$ does not have a specific value because it approaches 0 as x increases, due to the properties of functions with negative exponents.\n\nSince the function is decreasing and $f(1) = 1$, we know that the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ will be $[0, 1)$, because $f(x)$ approaches 0 as $x$ approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ is $\\boxed{[0, 1)}$."
