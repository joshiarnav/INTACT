    "problem": "A 1$\\%$ late charge was added to Jenna's bill on the $30^{\\text{th}}$ day past its due date. The resulting total was then increased by 1$\\%$ because she did not pay the bill in the next 30 days either. Her original bill was $\\$400$. Exactly how much is the bill now?",
    "solution": "The first late charge brings the bill to $400 \\cdot 1.01 = 400 + 4 = 404$. The second late charge brings the bill to $404 \\cdot 1.01 = 404 + 4.04 = \\boxed{408.04}$ dollars.\n\n-OR-\n\nEach increase multiples the bill by $1+1\\%=1.01$. Therefore, her final bill is $\\$400(1.01)^2=\\$408.04$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the final bill amount, we'll first calculate the amount after the first late charge, then add the second late charge.\n\n1. The original bill is $\\$400$. \n2. A 1$\\%$ late charge is added to this amount: \n$\\$400 * 0.01 = \\$4$. \nSo the bill is now $\\$400 + \\$4 = \\$404$.\n3. Then another 1$\\%$ late charge is added to this new amount: \n$\\$404 * 0.01 = \\$4.04$.\nSo the final bill amount is $\\$404 + \\$4.04 = \\$408.04$.\n\nTherefore, the bill is now $\\boxed{\\$408.04}$."
