    "problem": "What is the smallest positive value of $m$ so that the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ has integral solutions?",
    "solution": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the solutions the the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$. We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively, so $p+q = m/10$ and $pq = 420/10 = 42$. Since $m = 10(p+q)$, we minimize $m$ by minimizing the sum $p+q$. Since $p$ and $q$ are integers and multiply to 42, the possible values of $(p,q)$ are $(1,42),(2,21),(3,14),(6,7),(7,6),(14,3),(21,2),(42,1)$. (Note that if $p$ and $q$ are both negative, then $p+q$ is negative, so $m$ would be negative, which is excluded by the problem.) The sum $p+q$ is minimized when $(p,q) = (6,7)$ or $(7,6)$. In either case, $m = 10(p+q) = 10(6+7) = \\boxed{130}.$",

The discriminant is:\n\n$b^2 - 4ac = (-m)^2 - 4(10)(420) = m^2 - 16800$\n\nFor the discriminant to be a perfect square, $m^2 - 16800$ must be equal to $n^2$ for some integer $n$. \n\nWe are asked to find the smallest positive value of $m$, so we are looking for the smallest value of $n$ such that $m^2 - 16800 = n^2$.\n\nLet's rewrite the equation as $m^2 = n^2 + 16800$. \n\nThe smallest value of $n$ that satisfies this equation is $n = 130$, since $130^2 = 16900$. However, this is not correct since we would be getting a negative m, so we should consider the positive root of 130.\n\nLet's try $n = 129$: $129^2 = 16641$.\n\nNow, $n = 130$ is not the correct choice, since we would have a negative $m$.\n\nHowever, let's try $n = 131$: $131^2 = 17241$.\n\nSince the equation $m^2 = n^2 + 16800$ is an increasing function, the correct value of $n$ must be between $129$ and $131$. \n\nLet's try $n = 130.5$, but this is not an integer.\n\nHowever, we can try $n = 130.25$, but this is also not an integer.\n\nLet's consider the identity $(n + 0.5)^2 - 0.25 = n^2 + n + 0.25$. \n\nThus $(n + 0.5)^2 = n^2 + n + 0.25$ would not be the best idea for this problem since we want an integer.\n\nLet's try $n = 130.5 - 0.25 = 130.25$. However, this idea was not useful since we want $n$ to be an integer.\n\nLet's consider the identity $n^2 + n + 0.25 = (n + 0.5)^2 - 0.25$. \n\nNow, let's try expanding the expression:\n\n$n^2 + n + 0.25 = (n + 0.5)^2 - 0.25$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$n^2 + n + 0.25 = n^2 + n + 0.25 - 0.25$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$n^2 + n + 0.25 = n^2 + n$\n\nHowever, we want $n^2 + n + 0.25$ to be equal to $m^2 - 16800$. \n\nLet's rewrite the expression as:\n\n$n^2 + n = m^2 - 16800$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$m^2 = n^2 + n + 16800$. \n\nHowever, we are given that $m^2 - 16800 = n^2$. \n\nThus, adding $16800$ to both sides of the equation:\n\n$m^2 = n^2 + n + 16800$\n\nSubtracting $n^2$ from both sides of the equation:\n\n$m^2 - n^2 = n + 16800$\n\nFactoring the left-hand side of the equation:\n\n$(m + n)(m - n) = n + 16800$\n\nHowever, this is still not the correct approach to solve this problem.\n\nLet's consider this problem again and try a different approach.\n\nTo find the smallest positive value of m, we need to recall that for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ to have integral solutions, the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac$ must be a perfect square.\n\nIn this case, we have $a = 10$, $b = -m$, and $c = 420$. The discriminant is:\n\n$b^2 - 4ac = (-m)^2 - 4(10)(420) = m^2 - 16800$\n\nFor the discriminant to be a perfect square, $m^2 - 16800$ must be equal to $n^2$ for some integer $n$. \n\nWe are asked to find the smallest positive value of $m$, so we are looking for the smallest value of $n$ such that $m^2 - 16800 = n^2$.\n\nNow, let's try the following:\n\nLet $m^2 - 16800 = n^2$.\n\nLet's rewrite the equation as:\n\n$m^2 = n^2 + 16800$. \n\nThe smallest value of $n$ that satisfies this equation is $n = 130$, but this is not the correct choice since we would have a negative m.\n\nHowever, we can try $n = 129$: $129^2 = 16641$.\n\nSince the equation $m^2 = n^2 + 16800$ is an increasing function, the correct value of $n$ must be between $129$ and $130$.\n\nLet's try $n = 129.5$: $129.5^2 = 16740.25$.\n\nLet's try $n = 129.9$: $129.9^2 = 16823.61$.\n\nLet's try $n = 129.99$: $129.99^2 = 16864.00$.\n\nSince we are looking for the smallest positive value of m, we are looking for the smallest value of n such that m^2 - 16800 = n^2.\n\nHowever, we can try n = 130 and m = 130.
