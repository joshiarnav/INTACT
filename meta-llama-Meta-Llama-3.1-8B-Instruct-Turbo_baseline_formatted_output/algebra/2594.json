    "problem": "The third and fourth terms of a geometric sequence are 12 and 16, respectively. What is the first term of the sequence?",
    "solution": "The common ratio of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is given by $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{n-1}$, where $a$ is the first term of the sequence. Since the third term is 12, we plug in $n=3$ to get $a\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 12$. Solving, we have $a\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 12\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{4}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the first term of the geometric sequence, we need to find the common ratio and the second term. \n\nLet's denote the first term as 'a' and the common ratio as 'r'. \n\nThe third term is given as 12, which can be represented as ar^2 = 12. \n\nThe fourth term is given as 16, which can be represented as ar^3 = 16.\n\nWe can divide the equation for the fourth term by the equation for the third term to eliminate 'a':\n\nar^3 / ar^2 = 16 / 12\nr = 16 / 12\nr = 4 / 3\n\nNow that we have the common ratio (r = 4/3), we can find the second term by multiplying the first term 'a' with 'r'. However, we'll find the first term using the second term's representation as ar = 12. \n\nWe can find the second term by substituting the value of 'r' into the equation:\n\nar = 12\na * (4/3) = 12\na = 12 * (3/4)\na = 9\n\nThe first term of the sequence is 9.\n\n$\\boxed{9}$"
