    "solution": "This is a geometric sequence with first term $\\frac{1}{4}$ and common ratio $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus the sum of the first $n$ terms is:\n\n$\\frac{63}{128}=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{1-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n}{1-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)=\\frac{2^n-1}{2^{n+1}}$.\n\nWe see that $\\frac{63}{128}=\\frac{2^6-1}{2^7}$, so $n=\\boxed{6}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we will use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence: \n\nS_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nwhere a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and S_n is the sum of the first n terms.\n\nIn this case, the first term a = 1/4 and the common ratio r = 1/2 (since the sequence goes from 1/4 to 1/8, which is half).\n\nWe are given that the sum of the first n terms S_n = 63/128.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n(1/4) * (1 - (1/2)^n) / (1 - 1/2) = 63/128\n\n(1/4) * (1 - (1/2)^n) / (1/2) = 63/128\n\n(1/4) * 2 * (1 - (1/2)^n) = 63/128\n\n(1/2) * (1 - (1/2)^n) = 63/128\n\nTo make it easier to solve, multiply both sides by 2:\n\n1 - (1/2)^n = 63/64\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n-(1/2)^n = -1/64\n\nDivide both sides by -1:\n\n(1/2)^n = 1/64\n\nSince 1/64 = (1/2)^6, we can solve for n:\n\n(1/2)^n = (1/2)^6\n\nThis means that n = 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{6}$"
