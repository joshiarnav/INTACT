    "problem": "Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles. If it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles, using the same rates, how many minutes would it take Jordan to run 5 miles?",
    "solution": "Since Steve's 3-mile time is 24 minutes, Jordan ran 2 miles in $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot24=12$ minutes.  Therefore, each mile takes Jordan 6 minutes to run, so he would take $6\\cdot5=\\boxed{30}$ minutes to run five miles.",

    "model_solution": "To find the time it took Jordan to run 2 miles, we first need to determine the time it took Steve to run 3 miles, which is given as 24 minutes. \n\nSince Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles, we can find the time it took Jordan to run 2 miles by dividing 24 minutes by 2.\n\n24 minutes / 2 = 12 minutes\n\nThis means it took Jordan 12 minutes to run 2 miles. \n\nTo find the time it would take Jordan to run 5 miles, we can use the same rate. Since Jordan ran 2 miles in 12 minutes, we can divide the distance by the rate to find the time it takes him to run 1 mile.\n\n12 minutes / 2 miles = 6 minutes per mile\n\nNow, we can multiply the time it takes Jordan to run 1 mile by the distance of 5 miles to find the total time it takes him to run 5 miles.\n\n6 minutes per mile * 5 miles = 30 minutes\n\nTherefore, it would take Jordan $\\boxed{30}$ minutes to run 5 miles."
