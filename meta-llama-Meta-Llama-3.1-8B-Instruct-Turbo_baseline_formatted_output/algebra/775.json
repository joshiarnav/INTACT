    "solution": "Note that $f(x)$ is defined if and only if $x\\ge 3$.\n\nThus $f(f(x)) = f(\\sqrt{x-3})$ is defined if and only if $$\\sqrt{x-3}\\ge 3.$$ This is true if and only if $$x-3\\ge 3^2,$$ or equivalently, if $x\\ge 12$. So the smallest real number for which $f(f(x))$ is defined is $\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest real number x in the domain of f(f(x)), we need to find the smallest x for which f(x) is defined and then plug that into f(x).\n\nGiven $f(x) = \\sqrt{x - 3}$, we know that the expression inside the square root must be non-negative.\n\nFor the inner function, $f(x)$, we have:\n\n$x - 3 \\geq 0$ \n$x \\geq 3$\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest x for which the outer function is defined. This means we need to find the smallest x for which $f(x) = \\sqrt{x - 3} \\geq 3$.\n\nSolving $\\sqrt{x - 3} \\geq 3$, we get:\n\n$\\sqrt{x - 3} = 3$\n$ x - 3 = 9$\n$x = 4$\n\nSo, the smallest x for which the outer function is defined is x = 4.\n\nHowever, we need to check if this x satisfies the inner function's condition as well. Since $4 - 3 = 1 \\geq 0$, it does satisfy the inner function's condition.\n\nTherefore, the smallest real number x in the domain of f(f(x)) is $\\boxed{4}.$"
