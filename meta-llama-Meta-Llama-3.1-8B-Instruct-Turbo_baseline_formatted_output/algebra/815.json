    "problem": "The product of two positive integers plus their sum is 103. The integers are relatively prime, and each is less than 20. What is the sum of the two integers?",
    "solution": "Let our numbers be $a$ and $b$ with $a>b.$ Then $ab+a+b=103$. With Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick in mind, we add $1$ to both sides and get $ab+a+b+1 = 104$, which factors as $(a+1)(b+1)=104$. We consider pairs $(a+1, b+1)$ of factors of $104$: $(104,1), (52,2), (26,4), (13,8)$. Since $a<20$, we can rule out the first 3 pairs, which gives $a=12$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\\boxed{19}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's denote the two integers as $a$ and $b$. We are given that the product of $a$ and $b$ plus their sum is 103, and that $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime. \n\nGiven the problem, we have:\n\n$a \\cdot b + a + b = 103$\n\n$(a + 1)(b + 1) = 104$\n\nWe can factorize 104 as $104 = 2^4 \\cdot 13$.\n\nWe have the following possible cases:\n\nCase 1: $(a + 1) = 104, (b + 1) = 1$\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, we have $a = 103$ and $b = 0$. However, as $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime and positive, this case is not valid.\n\nCase 2: $(a + 1) = 26, (b + 1) = 4$\n\nWe have $a = 25$ and $b = 3$. However, $25$ and $3$ are not relatively prime.\n\nCase 3: $(a + 1) = 13, (b + 1) = 8$\n\nWe have $a = 12$ and $b = 7$. Since $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime and both are less than 20, this case is valid.\n\nWe have found that $a = 12$ and $b = 7$ are the integers that satisfy the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{19}$."
