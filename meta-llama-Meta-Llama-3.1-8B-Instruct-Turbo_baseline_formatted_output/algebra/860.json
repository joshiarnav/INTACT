    "problem": "The equation $x^2+ ax = -14$ has only integer solutions for $x$. If $a$ is a positive integer, what is the greatest possible value of $a$?",
    "solution": "The left-hand side factors into $x(x+a)=-14$, so $x$ and $x+a$ both divide $-14$. One of the two factors is negative and the other positive, since their product is negative. $x+a>x$, so $x+a>0$ and $x<0$. This leaves 4 possibilities for $x$, since it is negative and divides $-14$ evenly: $-1$, $-2$, $-7$, and $-14$. $x=-1$ gives $x+a=14$ and therefore $a=15$. Similarly, $x=-2$, $x=-7$, and $x=-14$ give $a=9$, $a=9$, and $a=15$, respectively. The largest value for $a$ is thus $\\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "To factor the equation $x^2 + ax = -14$, we can rewrite it as $x^2 + ax + 14 = 0$. \n\nFor this equation to have integer solutions, we need to find two integers $p$ and $q$ such that $(x + p)(x + q) = x^2 + (p + q)x + pq$. \n\nComparing with the original equation, we get $p + q = a$ and $pq = 14$. \n\nSince $a$ is a positive integer, $p + q$ must be positive. \n\nWe need to find all the positive integer pairs $(p, q)$ whose product is 14. \n\nThe pairs are: \n\n(1, 14), (2, 7), (-1, -14), (-2, -7).\n\nSince $a$ is a positive integer, we can ignore the pairs with negative numbers. \n\nFor each pair, we calculate the sum and find the maximum value. \n\nFor (1, 14), the sum is 15. \n\nFor (2, 7), the sum is 9. \n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of $a$ is $\\boxed{15}$."
