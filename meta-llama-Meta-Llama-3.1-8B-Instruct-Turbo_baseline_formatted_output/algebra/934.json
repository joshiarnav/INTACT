    "problem": "The graph of a certain quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertex $(-4,0)$ which passes through the point $(1,-75)$.  What is the value of $a$?",
    "solution": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic must be of the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$.  The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, which gives us the equation $-75 = 25a$.  Hence, $a = -75/25 = \\boxed{-3}$.",

    "model_solution": "The vertex form of a quadratic function is given by $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex. \n\nGiven that the vertex is $(-4,0)$, we can write the equation as $y = a(x + 4)^2$. \n\nThe parabola passes through the point $(1, -75)$. Substituting $x = 1$ and $y = -75$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$-75 = a(1 + 4)^2$\n\n$-75 = a(5)^2$\n\n$-75 = 25a$\n\n$a = \\frac{-75}{25}$\n\n$a = -3$\n\nThe value of $a$ is $\\boxed{-3}$."
