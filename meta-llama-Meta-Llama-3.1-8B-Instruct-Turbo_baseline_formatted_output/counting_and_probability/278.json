    "problem": "After a gymnastics meet, each gymnast shook hands once with every gymnast on every team (except herself). Afterwards, a coach came down and only shook hands with each gymnast from her own team. There were a total of 281 handshakes. What is the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in?",
    "solution": "The number of gymnasts is some integer $n$, so that the number of gymnast-gymnast handshakes is ${n \\choose 2}$ for some $n$. Also, the coach must participate in an integer $k<n$ number of handshakes. So, ${n \\choose 2} + k = 281$. If we want to minimize $k$, we need the maximal $n$ such that ${n \\choose 2} \\le 281$, which implies $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 281$ or $n^2 - n - 562 \\le 0 $. So, the maximal $n$ is 24. So, $k = 281 - {24 \\choose 2} = 281 - 12 \\cdot 23 = 281 - 276 = \\boxed{5}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's first consider the total number of handshakes without the coach. If there are $n$ gymnasts in total, then each gymnast shook hands with $n-1$ people, but this would count each handshake twice, so the total number of handshakes is $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\n\nLet's denote the number of gymnasts on the coach's team as $x$. Since there are $n$ gymnasts in total, there are $n-x$ gymnasts outside the coach's team. The total number of handshakes is $281$, and we have:\n\n$$\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + x = 281$$\n\nSince we want to minimize $x$, we want to maximize $n$. Let's find the maximum value of $n$ such that $n(n-1) \\leq 2 \\cdot 281$:\n\n$$n^2 - n - 562 \\leq 0$$\n\nWe can solve this inequality by using the quadratic formula:\n\n$$n \\leq \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 + 4 \\cdot 562}}{2} \\approx 24.2$$\n\nSince $n$ must be an integer, the maximum value of $n$ is $24$.\n\nIf $n = 24$, then we have:\n\n$$\\frac{24 \\cdot 23}{2} = 276$$\n\nThe number of handshakes outside the coach's team is $276$, so the number of handshakes with the coach's team is $281 - 276 = 5$. Therefore, the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in is $\\boxed{5}$."
