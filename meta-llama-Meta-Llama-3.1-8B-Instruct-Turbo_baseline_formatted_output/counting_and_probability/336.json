    "problem": "How many positive multiples of $7$ that are less than $1000$ end with the digit $3$?",
    "solution": "Listing the first 10 multiples of 7, which are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, we see that the only positive multiples of 7 that end in 3 are those that are the product of 7 and a number that ends in 9.  Therefore, the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3 are $7\\cdot 9 = 63$, $7\\cdot 19= 133$, $7\\cdot 29 = 203$, . . .  Notice that we can get from each to the next by adding $7\\cdot 10 = 70$, so our multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 are 63, 133, 203, . . ., 903, 973.  The last one is 910 more than the first. Since $910/70=13$, we see that we have taken 13 steps of 70 to get from the first number in the list to the last. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{14}$ numbers in the list.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the positive multiples of 7 that end with the digit 3. \n\nThese multiples can be represented as 7n = 10a + 3, where 'a' is the quotient and 'n' is the multiple. Since the last digit is 3, the last digit of 7n must be 3. \n\nWhen 7 is multiplied by 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 0, the last digit of the product is 1, 2, 5, 6, 3, and 0 respectively. \n\nTo get a last digit of 3, the last digit of the number in the form 7n must be 0, 3, 6, or 9. Since 7 is multiplied by 3, 6, and 9 to get a last digit of 3, the last digit of 7n must be 3, 6, or 9.\n\nLet's represent 7n = 10a + 3 as 7n = 10a + (10b + 3), where 'b' is the number in the form 3, 6, or 9.\n\n7n = 10a + 10b + 3\n7n - 10b = 10a + 3\n7n - 10b = 10(a + b/10) + 3\n\nThe equation 7n must be 10(a + b/10) + 3 and the last digit of 7n must be 3.\n\nSince the last digit of 7n is 3, the last digit of 10(a + b/10) must be 0.\n\nThe last digit of a + b/10 must be 0.\n\nIf the last digit of 'b' is 3, the last digit of a + b/10 is 0.3, which is not 0.\n\nIf the last digit of 'b' is 6, the last digit of a + b/10 is 0.6, which is not 0.\n\nIf the last digit of 'b' is 9, the last digit of a + b/10 is 0.9, which is not 0.\n\nIf the last digit of 'b' is 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 8, the last digit of a + b/10 is 0.\n\nThe possible values of b are 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 8.\n\nBut we also know that the last digit of 7'7n'7 is 3.\n\nIf 'b' is 0, the last digit of 'b' = 7'7b'7 is 7'7'0'7 = 0.\n\nIf 'b' is 2, the last digit of 'b' = 7'7b'7 is 7'7'2'7 = 6.\n\nIf 'b' is 4, the last digit of 'b' = 7'7b'7 is 7'7'4'7 = 8.\n\nIf 'b' is 5, the last digit of 'b' = 7'7b'7 is 7'7'5'7 = 5.\n\nIf 'b' is 7, the last digit of 'b' = 7'7b'7 is 7'7'7'7 = 3.\n\nIf 'b' is 8, the last digit of 'b' = 7'7b'7 is 7'7'8'7 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value of 'b' is 7.\n\nNow, we can find all the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3.\n\nThe possible values of 7n are 7 * 7 = 49, 7 * 14 = 98, 7 * 21 = 147, 7 * 28 = 196, 7 * 35 = 245, 7 * 42 = 294, 7 * 49 = 343, 7 * 56 = 392, 7 * 63 = 441, 7 * 70 = 490, 7 * 77 = 539, 7 * 84 = 588, 7 * 91 = 637, 7 * 98 = 686, 7 * 105 = 735, 7 * 112 = 784, 7 * 119 = 833, 7 * 126 = 882, 7 * 133 = 931, 7 * 140 = 980.\n\nTherefore, there are 14 positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{14}$."
