    "solution": "As with solution $1$ we would like to note that given any quadrilateral we can change its angles to make a cyclic one.\nLet $a \\ge b \\ge c\\ge d$ be the sides of the quadrilateral.\nThere are $\\binom{31}{3}$ ways to partition $32$. However, some of these will not be quadrilaterals since they would have one side bigger than the sum of the other three. This occurs when $a \\ge 16$. For $a=16$, $b+c+d=16$. There are $\\binom{15}{2}$ ways to partition $16$. Since $a$ could be any of the four sides, we have counted $4\\binom{15}{2}$ degenerate quadrilaterals. Similarly, there are $4\\binom{14}{2}$, $4\\binom{13}{2} \\cdots 4\\binom{2}{2}$ for other values of $a$. Thus, there are $\\binom{31}{3} - 4\\left(\\binom{15}{2}+\\binom{14}{2}+\\cdots+\\binom{2}{2}\\right) = \\binom{31}{3} - 4\\binom{16}{3} = 2255$ non-degenerate partitions of $32$ by the hockey stick theorem. We then account for symmetry. If all sides are congruent (meaning the quadrilateral is a square), the quadrilateral will be counted once. If the quadrilateral is a rectangle (and not a square), it will be counted twice. In all other cases, it will be counted 4 times. Since there is $1$ square case, and $7$ rectangle cases, there are $2255-1-2\\cdot7=2240$ quadrilaterals counted 4 times. Thus there are $1+7+\\frac{2240}{4} = \\boxed{568}$ total quadrilaterals.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Brahmagupta's formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral. However, we will instead use the fact that for a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of the products of opposite sides is constant.\n\nNow, let's consider a cyclic quadrilateral. If we label the sides as $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, the sum of the products of opposite sides can be represented as $ac+bd$. Now, we will divide this into two cases.\n\nCase 1: $a \\ge b \\ge c \\ge d$. In this case, we have the constraint $ac+bd \\le ac+ad \\le ac+bc \\le ac+cd \\le ac+bd$, which implies $bd \\le ad \\le bc \\le cd \\le bd$. However, considering this would make it too complicated. So, let's simplify this by considering the constraints $a \\ge b$ and $c \\ge d$.\n\nCase 2: $a < b < c < d$. In this case, we have the constraint $ac+bd \\ge ac+ad \\ge ac+bc \\ge ac+cd \\ge ac+bd$, which implies $ad \\ge bc \\ge cd \\ge bd \\ge ad$. Considering this as well would make it too complicated. So, let's simplify this by considering the constraints $a < b$ and $c < d$.\n\nCombining the constraints from both cases, we can consider the following constraints: $a \\ge b \\ge c \\ge d$ and $a < b < c < d$. \n\nHowever, these are not the only two possibilities. Let's consider another possibility: $a \\ge b > c \\ge d$. However, we can see that this possibility reduces to the first case. Similarly, let's consider the case $a < b \\ge c > d$. However, this reduces to the second case. \n\nSo, the two cases are sufficient. However, we can make the problem easier by only considering the first case $a \\ge b \\ge c \\ge d$. This will reduce the number of combinations, but it will not affect the final result.\n\nNow, considering the constraints for the first case, we have the following inequalities: $a \\ge b \\ge c \\ge d > 0$, $a + b + c + d = 32$, and $bd \\le ad \\le bc \\le cd \\le bd$. However, we can simplify this to just $bd \\le ad \\le bc \\le cd$.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values for $a$. Since the perimeter is 32, we have the constraint $a \\le 16$. \n\nNow, let's consider the possible values for $a$. Since the perimeter is 32, we have the constraint $a \\le 16$. Similarly, we have the constraints $b \\le 16$, $c \\le 16$, and $d \\le 16$.\n\nNow, we can find the number of combinations for each possible value of $a$. Since $bd \\le ad \\le bc \\le cd$, we know that $a$ must be at least 5. This is because $a = 4$ would allow $bd$ to be greater than $ad$, which would contradict the constraint $bd \\le ad$.\n\nSo, let's consider the possible values for $a$. We have the following possibilities: $a = 5$, $a = 6$, $a = 7$, $a = 8$, $a = 9$, $a = 10$, $a = 11$, $a = 12$, $a = 13$, $a = 14$, and $a = 15$. \n\nNow, let's find the number of combinations for each possible value of $a$. We can do this by finding the number of combinations of $b$, $c$, and $d$ that satisfy the constraints $bd \\le ad \\le bc \\le cd$.\n\nFor $a = 5$, we have the constraints $5b + 5c + d = 27$, $bd \\le 5d \\le 5c \\le cd \\le bd$. Solving these inequalities, we get $1 \\le d \\le 5$, $5 \\le c \\le 11$, $5 \\le b \\le 10$. Since $b \\le c$, we know that $c \\ge 5$. Since $c \\le 11$, we know that $c = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11$. Since $b \\le c$, we know that $b \\ge 5$. However, since $b \\le 10$, we know that $b = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10$. Since $d \\le 5$, we know that $d = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$. So, we have the following combinations: $(5, 5, 5, 7)$, $(5, 6, 5, 6)$, $(5, 6, 6, 5)$, $(5, 7, 5, 5)$, $(5, 7, 6, 4)$, $(5, 8, 5, 4)$, $(5, 8, 6, 3)$, $(5, 9, 5, 3)$, $(5, 9, 6, 2)$, $(5, 10, 5, 2)$, $(5, 10, 6, 1)$, $(6, 6, 5, 5)$, $(6, 7, 5, 4)$, $(6, 7, 6, 3)$, $(6, 8, 5, 3)$, $(6, 8, 6, 2)$, $(6, 9, 5, 2)$, $(6, 9, 6, 1)$, $(7, 7, 5, 3)$, $(7, 8, 5, 2)$, $(7, 8, 6, 1)$.\n\nFor $a = 6$, we have the constraints $6b + 6c + d = 30$, $bd \\le 6d \\le 6c \\le cd \\le bd$. Solving these inequalities, we get $1 \\le d \\le 6$, $6 \\le c \\le 13$, $6 \\le b \\le 13$. Since $b \\le c$, we know that $c \\ge 6$. Since $c \\le 13$, we know that $c = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13$. Since $b \\le c$, we know that $b \\ge 6$. However, since $b \\le 13$, we know that $b = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13$. Since $d \\le 6$, we know that $d = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$. So, we have the following combinations: $(6, 6, 6, 4)$, $(6, 6, 7, 3)$, $(6, 7, 6, 3)$, $(6, 7, 7, 2)$, $(6, 8, 6, 2)$, $(6, 8, 7, 1)$, $(7, 7, 6, 2)$, $(7, 8, 6, 1)$.\n\nFor $a = 7$, we have the constraints $7b + 7c + d = 33$, $bd \\le 7d \\le 7c \\le cd \\le bd$. Solving these inequalities, we get $1 \\le d \\le 7$, $7 \\le c \\le 16$, $7 \\le b \\le 16$. Since $b \\le c$, we know that $c \\ge 7$. Since $c \\le 16$, we know that $c = 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16$. Since $b \\le c$, we know that $b \\ge 7$. However, since $b \\le 16$, we know that $b = 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16$. Since $d \\le 7$, we know that $d = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$. So, we have the following combinations: $(7, 7, 7, 1)$, $(7, 7, 8, 0)$, $(7, 8, 7, 0)$, $(7, 9, 7, -1)$, $(8, 8, 7, -1)$, $(8, 9, 7, -2)$, $(9, 9, 7, -2)$, $(9, 10, 7, -3)$, $(10, 10, 7, -3)$, $(10, 11, 7"
