    "problem": "If I have a $4\\times 4$ chess board, in how many ways can I place four distinct pawns on the board such that each column and row of the board contains no more than one pawn?",
    "solution": "Because our chess board is $4 \\times 4$, there must be exactly one pawn in each column and each row. Consider the ways to place one pawn in each row. In the first row, there are four potential spots for a pawn. However, no matter where we place the pawn, it takes up one column. So, in the second row, there are only three potential spots for a pawn. Similarly, there are two spots in the third row and only one in the fourth. Thus, there are $4\\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 24$ ways in which we can place the pawns. Now, because each pawn is distinct, we have four possible pawns to place in the first slot, three in the second, two in the fourth, and one in the last. So there are $24$ possible orderings of the pawns. Our final answer is thus $24^2 = \\boxed{576}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the restrictions given. For the first pawn, we can place it on any of the 16 squares on the board. This is because we can choose any row and column for the first pawn.\n\nFor the second pawn, we have 9 remaining squares to place it, because one row and one column are now occupied by the first pawn. \n\nFor the third pawn, we have 4 remaining squares to place it, because two rows and two columns are now occupied by the first two pawns.\n\nFor the fourth pawn, we have only 1 remaining square to place it, because three rows and three columns are now occupied by the first three pawns.\n\nSo the total number of ways to place the four distinct pawns on the board is: \n\n16 * 9 * 4 * 1 = 576.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{576}$."
