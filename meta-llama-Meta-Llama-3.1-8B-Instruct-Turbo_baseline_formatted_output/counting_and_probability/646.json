    "problem": "A Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans. Assuming all politicians are distinguishable, in how many ways can they sit around a circular table without restrictions?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "There are 10 people to place, so we can place them in $10!$ ways, but this counts each valid arrangement 10 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement).  So the number of ways to seat them is $\\dfrac{10!}{10} = 9! = \\boxed{362,\\!880}$.",

    "file_name": "./MATH_subsample_uniform/counting_and_probability/646.json",
    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can start by calculating the total number of ways to arrange 10 distinguishable politicians in a row, which is 10!. However, since the table is circular, we need to account for the fact that rotations of the same arrangement are considered equivalent.\n\nTo do this, we divide the total number of arrangements by the number of possible rotations, which is the number of politicians (10). This is because each arrangement has 10 identical rotations, so we need to divide by 10 to avoid overcounting.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the politicians around a circular table is therefore:\n\n10! / 10\n= (10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / 10\n= 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1\n= 362880\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{362880}$."
