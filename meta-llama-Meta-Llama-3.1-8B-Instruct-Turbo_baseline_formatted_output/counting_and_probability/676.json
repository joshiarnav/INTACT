    "problem": "I have 10 distinguishable socks in my drawer: 4 white, 4 brown, and 2 blue.  In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of the same color?",
    "solution": "The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue.  If the socks are white, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are brown, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are blue, there is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ choice.  So the total number of choices for socks is $6 + 6 + 1 = \\boxed{13}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color, we need to consider each color separately.\n\nFor white socks, we can choose a pair in $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.\nFor brown socks, we can choose a pair in $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.\nFor blue socks, we can choose a pair in $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ way.\n\nNow, we add up the number of ways for each color to get the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color:\n\n$6 + 6 + 1 = 13$\n\nSo, there are $\\boxed{13}$ ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color."
