    "model_solution": "To find the number of ways George can choose two colors out of seven to paint his room, we use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of colors (7), and k is the number of colors to choose (2).\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!)\n= 7! / (2! * 5!)\n= (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n= (7 * 6) / (2 * 1)\n= 21\n\nSo, there are 21 ways for George to choose two colors out of seven to paint his room.\n\n$\\boxed{21}$"
