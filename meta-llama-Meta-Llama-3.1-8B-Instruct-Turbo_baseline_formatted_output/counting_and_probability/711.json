    "solution": "Since there are twelve steps between $(0,0)$ and $(5,7)$, $A$ and $B$ can meet only after they have each moved six steps. The possible meeting places are $P_{0} = (0,6)$, $P_{1} = (1,5)$, $P_{2} = (2,4)$, $P_{3}=(3,3)$, $P_{4} = (4,2)$, and $P_{5} =\n(5,1)$. Let $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ denote the number of paths to $P_{i}$ from $(0,0)$ and $(5,7)$, respectively. Since $A$ has to take $i$ steps to the right and $B$ has to take $i+1$ steps down, the number of ways in which $A$ and $B$ can meet at $P_{i}$ is $$a_{i}\\cdot b_{i} = \\binom{6}{i} \\binom{6}{i+1}. $$Since $A$ and $B$ can each take $2^{6}$ paths in six steps, the probability that they meet  is \\begin{align*}\n&\\sum_{i = 0}^{5}\\displaystyle\\left ( \\frac{a_{i}}{2^{6}}\\displaystyle\\right)\\displaystyle\\left( \\frac{b_{i}}{2^{6}} \\displaystyle\\right) \\\\\n& \\qquad = \\frac{\\binom{6}{0}\\binom{6}{1} + \\binom{6}{1}\\binom{6}{2} + \\binom{6}{2}\\binom{6}{3}\n+ \\binom{6}{3}\\binom{6}{4}+ \\binom{6}{4}\\binom{6}{5} + \\binom{6}{5}\\binom{6}{6}}{2^{12}}\\\\\n& \\qquad = \\frac{99}{512} \\\\\n& \\qquad \\approx \\boxed{0.20}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the objects meet, we first need to find the number of ways they can meet. \n\nObject $A$ can move in a total of $n$ steps, where $n$ is an integer from $1$ to $12$. For $A$ to meet $B$, it must have made $x$ steps to the right and $y$ steps upwards, where $x+y=n$. To meet at a specific point $(x,y)$, the number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{x}$ multiplied by the number of ways to move from $(5,7)$ to $(x, y)$, which is $\\binom{12}{x-5}\\binom{12}{y-7}$.\n\nHowever, this is an overly complicated approach. The key observation here is that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is always decreasing when they meet, because the number of steps $A$ has taken to the right is always less than or equal to the number of steps it has taken upwards.\n\nWe can use this fact to count the number of ways they meet. \n\nSince the total distance moved by $A$ is always less than or equal to the total distance moved by $B$, the meeting point must be inside the square with vertices at $(0,7)$, $(5,7)$, $(0,5)$, and $(5,5)$. The number of ways the meeting point can be $(x,y)$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{12}{x}\\binom{12}{y}$.\n\nHowever, we must also take into account that the point $(x,y)$ is within the square. Since $(x,y)$ is within the square, $x > y-2$ and $y < x+2$.\n\nSince there are $\\binom{12}{x}$ ways for $A$ to end up at the point $(x,0)$, and $\\binom{12}{y}$ ways for $B$ to end up at the point $(0,y)$, the number of ways they can meet at the point $(x,y)$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{12}{x}\\binom{12}{y}$, where $x > y-2$ and $y < x+2$.\n\nThe sum of the number of ways for the objects to meet is then given by the sum over $x$ and $y$ of the binomial coefficient $\\binom{12}{x}\\binom{12}{y}$, where $x > y-2$ and $y < x+2$. \n\nUsing the symmetry of the binomial coefficients, this sum can be rewritten as:\n\n$\\sum_{x=0}^{12}\\sum_{y=0}^x\\binom{12}{x}\\binom{12}{y}$\n\n$= \\sum_{x=0}^{12}\\sum_{y=0}^x\\binom{12}{x}\\binom{12}{12-x+y}$\n\n$= \\sum_{x=0}^{12}\\binom{12}{x}\\sum_{y=0}^x\\binom{12}{12-x+y}$\n\nNow, we can use the fact that $\\sum_{y=0}^x\\binom{12}{12-x+y}=\\sum_{y=0}^x\\binom{12}{y}$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the number of ways for the objects to meet is given by:\n\n$\\sum_{x=0}^{12}\\binom{12}{x}\\sum_{y=0}^x\\binom{12}{y}$\n\n$= \\sum_{x=0}^{12}\\binom{12}{x}(\\frac{1}{2})\\cdot\\sum_{y=0}^{12}\\binom{12}{y}$\n\n$= \\frac{\\sum_{x=0}^{12}\\binom{12}{x}\\cdot\\sum_{y=0}^{12}\\binom{12}{y}}{2}$\n\nUsing the symmetry of the binomial coefficients, we have $\\sum_{x=0}^{12}\\binom{12}{x}=\\sum_{y=0}^{12}\\binom{12}{y}$. Therefore, the sum of the number of ways for the objects to meet is given by:\n\n$\\frac{(\\sum_{x=0}^{12}\\binom{12}{x})^2}{2} = 2\\cdot 18368^2 /2$ \n\nNow, we need to find the total number of paths for $A$ and $B$ to move to their respective end points.\n\nThe total number of paths for $A$ to move from $(0,0)$ to $(x,y)$ is $\\binom{12}{x}\\binom{12}{y}$. The total number of paths for $B$ to move from $(5,7)$ to $(x,y)$ is $\\binom{12}{x-5}\\binom{12}{y-7}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the objects meet is given by:\n\n$\\frac{2\\cdot 18368^2 /2}{\\binom{12}{5}\\binom{12}{7}+\\binom{12}{0}\\binom{12}{12}+\\binom{12}{1}\\binom{12}{11}+\\binom{12}{2}\\binom{12}{10}+\\binom{12}{3}\\binom{12}{9}+\\binom{12}{4}\\binom{12}{8}+\\binom{12}{5}\\binom{12}{7}}$\n\n$=  \\frac{ 2\\cdot 18368^2 /2}{ \\frac{2^15^8+2^{12}12^6}{2^7}}$\n\n$\\approx 0.05$\n\nNone of the given options are equal to the calculated probability. However, the closest option is $\\boxed{B}$."
