    "problem": "In a trapezoid $ABCD$ with $AB$ parallel to $CD$, the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$. If the area of triangle $ABE$ is 50 square units, and the area of triangle $ADE$ is 20 square units, what is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?",
    "solution": "[asy]\nsize(2.5inch);\npair A,B,C,D,E;\nA = (-3,4);\nB = (5,4);\nC = (4,0);\nD = (0,0);\nE = intersectionpoint(A--C, B--D);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle); draw(A--C); draw(B--D);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW); label(\"$B$\", B, NE); label(\"$C$\", C, SE); label(\"$D$\", D, SW); label(\"$E$\", E, N);\n[/asy] We will write the area of triangle $XYZ$ as $[XYZ].$  Since triangles $ADC$ and $BCD$ share a base and have the same altitude length to that base, they have the same area. Since $[BCD] = [ADC]$, we have $[BCE] + [CDE] = [ADE] + [CDE]$, so  $[BCE] = [ADE] = 20$.\n\nTo find the area of triangle $CDE$, we note that triangles $CDE$ and $ABE$ are similar, and the ratio of their sides is $DE/BE$. Triangles $ADE$ and $ABE$ share an altitude, so $DE/BE = [ADE]/[ABE] = 20/50 = 2/5$. Since the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their sides, $[CDE]/[ABE] = (DE/BE)^2 = 4/25$, and $[CDE] = (4/25)[ABE] = (4/25)(50) = 8$. Thus, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $[ABE] + [ADE] + [BCE] + [CDE] = 50+20+20+8 = \\boxed{98}$.",

    "model_solution": "Since the diagonals of a trapezoid intersect at right angles, triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ have the same height, which is also the height of the trapezoid. \n\nLet $AE = x$, $BE = y$ and $DE = z$. Then we have $\\frac{1}{2}xy = 50$ and $\\frac{1}{2}xz = 20$. This implies that $xy = 100$ and $xz = 40$. \n\nSince $AB$ is parallel to $CD$, the ratio of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ is equal to the ratio of the lengths of $BE$ and $DE$. This implies that $\\frac{xy}{xz} = \\frac{BE}{DE}$. Since we have $\\frac{xy}{xz} = \\frac{100}{40} = \\frac{5}{2}$ and $BE = y$, we have $\\frac{BE}{DE} = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nThis implies that $DE = \\frac{2}{5}BE$. \n\nSince $BE$ and $DE$ are the bases of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$, we have $\\frac{BE}{DE} = \\frac{[ABE]}{[ADE]}$. Since we have $\\frac{BE}{DE} = \\frac{5}{2}$ and $\\frac{[ABE]}{[ADE]} = \\frac{50}{20} = \\frac{5}{2}$, we have $\\frac{[ABE]}{[ADE]} = \\frac{5}{2}$. This is consistent with our previous result.\n\nSince the ratio of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ is equal to the ratio of their bases, the ratio of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ is also equal to the ratio of their heights. The height of triangle $ABE$ is also the height of the trapezoid. Let $h$ be this height. Then we have $\\frac{[ABE]}{h} = \\frac{[ADE]}{h} = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nSince the height of triangle $ABE$ is the same as the height of triangle $ADE$, we have $\\frac{[ABE]}{h} = \\frac{[ADE]}{h}$. This implies that $[ABE] = [ADE]\\cdot \\frac{5}{2}$. However, this is not possible if the ratio of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ is greater than 1. Hence, we must have $[ABE] > [ADE]\\cdot \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nHowever, we have $[ABE] = 50$ and $[ADE] = 20$. This implies that $[ABE] > [ADE]\\cdot \\frac{5}{2}$ is not true. We can conclude that $[ABE] = [ADE]\\cdot \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nSince we have $[ABE] = 50$ and $[ADE] = 20$, we have $\\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{50}{20} = \\frac{5}{2}$. This is consistent with our previous result.\n\nHowever, we can see that the ratio of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ is equal to the ratio of their bases, which is equal to the ratio of their heights. Hence, we can conclude that the ratio of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ is equal to the ratio of their bases, which is equal to the ratio of their heights. \n\nWe have $\\frac{[ABE]}{[ADE]} = \\frac{xy}{xz} = \\frac{100}{40} = \\frac{5}{2}$. Hence, we have $[ADE] = \\frac{2}{5}[ABE] = \\frac{2}{5}\\cdot 50 = 20$. \n\nThe area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is equal to the sum of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$, and the area of triangle $CDE$. \n\nThe area of triangle $CDE$ is equal to the area of triangle $ADE$ minus the area of triangle $ADE$ within triangle $CDE$. \n\nHowever, since triangle $CDE$ and triangle $ADE$ share the same base $DE$ and the same height $h$, we can conclude that the area of triangle $ADE$ within triangle $CDE$ is equal to the ratio of the areas of triangle $ADE$ and triangle $CDE$ multiplied by the area of triangle $ADE$. \n\nHowever, we have $\\frac{[ADE]}{[CDE]} = \\frac{[ADE]}{[ABE] + [ADE] - [ABE]} = \\frac{20}{50 + 20 - 50} = \\frac{20}{20} = 1$. \n\nThis implies that the area of triangle $ADE$ within triangle $CDE$ is equal to the area of triangle $ADE$. \n\nHence, the area of triangle $CDE$ is equal to the area of triangle $ADE$ minus the area of triangle $ADE$ within triangle $CDE$. \n\nHowever, we have already concluded that the area of triangle $ADE$ within triangle $CDE$ is equal to the area of triangle $ADE$. \n\nHence, the area of triangle $CDE$ is equal to the area of triangle $ADE$ minus the area of triangle $ADE$, which is equal to 0. \n\nThe area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is equal to the sum of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$, and the area of triangle $CDE$. \n\nHowever, we have already concluded that the area of triangle $CDE$ is equal to 0. \n\nHence, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is equal to the sum of the areas of triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$, which is equal to $[ABE] + [ADE] = 50 + 20 = 70$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{70}$"
