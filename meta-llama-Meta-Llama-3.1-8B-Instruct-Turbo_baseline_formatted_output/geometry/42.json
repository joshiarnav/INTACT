    "solution": "We first draw a diagram: [asy]\npair A, B, C, E, F;\nA = (0, 4);\nB = (-3, 0);\nC = (7, 0);\nE = 0.5 * A + 0.5 * C;\nF = 0.5 * A + 0.5 * B;\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--E--F--cycle);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\n[/asy] Since $F$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, the area of $\\triangle AFC$ is half of the area of $\\triangle ABC,$ or 12 square units. Following the same reasoning, we see that $E$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AC},$ so the area of $\\triangle CEF$ is half that of $\\triangle AFC,$ or $\\boxed{6}$ square units.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of triangle $\\triangle CEF$, we need to consider the relationship between the areas of similar triangles. Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of sides $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{AB}$, the triangle $\\triangle CEF$ is similar to $\\triangle ABC$. The ratio of the sides of $\\triangle CEF$ to $\\triangle ABC$ is $1:2$.\n\nWhen two similar triangles have a ratio of their sides $1:k$, the ratio of their areas is $\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\right)^2$. In this case, we have $k=2$, so the ratio of the areas of $\\triangle CEF$ to $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSince the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is 24 square units, the area of $\\triangle CEF$ can be calculated as:\n\nArea of $\\triangle CEF$ = $\\frac{1}{4}$ \u00d7 Area of $\\triangle ABC$\n= $\\frac{1}{4}$ \u00d7 24\n= 6 square units\n\nTherefore, the area of $\\triangle CEF$ is 6 square units.\n\n$\\boxed{6}$"
