    "problem": "A triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units. The length of the third side is $x$ units, where $x$ is an integer. What is the largest possible perimeter of the triangle?",
    "solution": "If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$",

    "model_solution": "According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. \n\nLet's apply the triangle inequality theorem to the given problem:\n\n1. The sum of the lengths of the two known sides (5 and 6) must be greater than the length of the unknown side: \n5 + 6 > x\n11 > x\n\n2. The length of the unknown side must be greater than the absolute difference between the lengths of the two known sides:\n|x - 5| > 6 - 5\n|x - 5| > 1\n\n3. The length of the unknown side must be less than the sum of the lengths of the two known sides:\nx < 5 + 6\nx < 11\n\nSo, we have a range of possible values for x: 1 < x < 11 and x is an integer.\n\nTo maximize the perimeter, we should choose the largest possible integer value for x, which is 10.\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is 5 + 6 + 10 = 21 units.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible perimeter of the triangle is $\\boxed{21}$."
