    "solution": "Let the coordinates of $A$ be $(a_1,a_2)$. Then since $A$ is on the graph of $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, we know that $a_2 = -\\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$. We can also use our knowledge of special right triangles to write $a_2$ in terms of $a_1$. Let $C$ be the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ and let $O$ be the origin. Then $OCA$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, so the ratio of the length of $OC$ to the length of $CA$ is $\\sqrt{3}:1$. Now the coordinates of C are $(0, a_2)$, so the length of $OC$ is just $-a_2$ (since $a_2$ is negative) and the length of $CA$ is $a_1$. This means $\\dfrac{-a_2}{a_1}=\\sqrt{3} \\Longrightarrow a_2=-\\sqrt{3}a_1$.\n\nWe can now set our two equations for $a_2$ equal to each other and get $-\\sqrt{3}a_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}a_1^2$. Multiplying both sides by $-\\frac{2}{a_1}$ immediately gives $a_1=2\\sqrt{3}$. From here we could solve for $a_2$ using one of our equations and then use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the side length of the equilateral triangle, but there's a better way. We remember that the hypotenuse of our special triangle is twice as long as the shortest side of it, which has length $a_1=2\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore our answer is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the length of one side of triangle $ABO$, we need to find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. We know that the triangle is equilateral, so the distance from $O$ to both $A$ and $B$ is the same. The distance from $O$ to $B$ is the horizontal distance, which is $3\\sqrt{3}$ units.\n\nLet's find the coordinates of $B$. We know that the distance from $O$ to $B$ is $3\\sqrt{3}$ units, which is horizontal. So, the $x$-coordinate of $B$ is $\\pm3\\sqrt{3}$. We also know that the $y$-coordinate of $B$ is the same as the $y$-coordinate of $A$. Since the distance from $O$ to $B$ is the same as the distance from $O$ to $A$, we can find the $y$-coordinate of $B$ by solving for the $y$-coordinate of $A$.\n\nSince we know that the points $A$ and $B$ are on the graph of $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2$, we can substitute the coordinates of $A$ into the equation and solve for the $y$-coordinate. Let the coordinates of $A$ be $(a, -\\frac{1}{2}a^2)$. Then, the coordinates of $B$ will be $(-a, -\\frac{1}{2}a^2)$.\n\nWe also know that the distance from $O$ to $B$ is $\\sqrt{3^2 + a^2}$, which is equal to $3\\sqrt{3}$. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n$\\sqrt{3^2 + a^2} = 3\\sqrt{3}$\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n$9 + a^2 = 27$\n\nSubtracting 9 from both sides, we get:\n\n$a^2 = 18$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$a = \\pm\\sqrt{18}$\n\n$a = \\pm3\\sqrt{2}$\n\nSince the distance from $O$ to $A$ is the same as the distance from $O$ to $B$, we can find the length of one side of the triangle by using the distance formula:\n\n$AB = \\sqrt{(3\\sqrt{2} - (-3\\sqrt{2}))^2 + ( -\\frac{1}{2}(3\\sqrt{2})^2 -(-\\frac{1}{2}(-3\\sqrt{2})^2))^2}$\n\n$AB = \\sqrt{(6\\sqrt{2})^2 + (-\\frac{1}{2}(18))^2}$\n\n$AB = \\sqrt{72 + 9}$\n\n$AB = \\sqrt{81}$\n\n$AB = \\boxed{9}$."
