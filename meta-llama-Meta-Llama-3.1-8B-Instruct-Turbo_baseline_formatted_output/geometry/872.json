    "solution": "Since $MC = 8$ and $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$, we have $MB=MC = 8$, so $BC=8+8=16$.  Since $B$ and $C$ trisect $\\overline{AD}$, we have $AB = CD = BC = 16$, so $AD =16+16+16=\\boxed{48}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem. \n\nWe know that $MC = 8$ and $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, so we can draw a line to connect $B$ and $M$. We also know that $B$ trisects $\\overline{AD}$, and since $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, we can see that $BM$ is half of $\\overline{BC}$. \n\nSince $B$ trisects $\\overline{AD}$, $\\overline{BC}$ is twice the length of $\\overline{BM}$, which is half of $\\overline{BC}$. Therefore, $\\overline{BC}$ is equal to $\\overline{BM}$. \n\nUsing this information, we can determine that $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{AC}$ are equal. \n\nSince $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, we can see that $\\overline{AM}$ is half of $\\overline{AD}$. We also know that $\\overline{BM}$ is half of $\\overline{BC}$, and since $\\overline{BC}$ is half of $\\overline{AC}$, we can see that $\\overline{BM}$ is one fourth of $\\overline{AD}$. \n\nSince $MC = 8$, and $\\overline{MC}$ is one fourth of $\\overline{AD}$, $\\overline{AD}$ is $4 \\times 8 = 32$ units.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{32}$ is the length of $\\overline{AD}$."
