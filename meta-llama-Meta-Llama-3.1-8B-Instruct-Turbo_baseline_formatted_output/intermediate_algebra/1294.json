    "solution": "From the given information we know that $|a| |b| = |ab| = 2\\sqrt{26}$. We can also write $|ab| = |t-2i| = \\sqrt{t^2 + 4}$. Setting these equal, we have $$\\sqrt{t^2 + 4} = 2\\sqrt{26} \\Rightarrow\nt^2 + 4 = 104.$$The positive answer is $t = \\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the positive value of $t$ that satisfies $ab = t-2i$, we can use the fact that the magnitude of the product of two complex numbers is the product of their magnitudes. \n\nSince $|a|=2$ and $|b|=\\sqrt{26}$, we have:\n\n$$|ab| = |a| |b| = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{26} = 2\\sqrt{26}$$\n\nThe magnitude of $ab$ is also equal to the magnitude of $t-2i$, which is $\\sqrt{t^2 + 4}$. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n$$\\sqrt{t^2 + 4} = 2\\sqrt{26}$$\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n$$t^2 + 4 = 4 \\cdot 26 = 104$$\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get:\n\n$$t^2 = 100$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$$t = \\pm 10$$\n\nSince we are asked to find the positive value of $t$, the answer is:\n\n$$\\boxed{10}$$"
