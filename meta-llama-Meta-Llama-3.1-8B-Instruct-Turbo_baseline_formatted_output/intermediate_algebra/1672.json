    "problem": "The domain of the function $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$ is $[0,\\infty)$. What is the range?",
    "solution": "We have $q(x) = (x^2+2)^2$. We wish to determine the set of all $y$ for which $q(x)=y$ has solutions. We must have $y\\ge 0$, since $q(x)$ is a square and squares are nonnegative. Under the assumption $y\\ge 0$, we have:\n$$\\begin{array}{r r@{~=~}l}\n& y & (x^2+2)^2 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & \\sqrt y & x^2+2 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & \\sqrt y-2 & x^2 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$We see that $\\sqrt y-2\\ge 0$ because squares are nonnegative. Thus, we need $y\\ge 4$. When $y\\ge 4$, we have $y=q(x)$ by setting $x$ equal to either of $\\pm \\sqrt{\\sqrt y-2}$, and so any $y\\ge 4$ can be achieved.\n\nTherefore, the range of $q(x)$ is $\\boxed{[4,\\infty)}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the range, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of the function. \n\nSince $x^4 \\geq 0$ and $4x^2 \\geq 0$ for all real numbers $x$, the function $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$ has a minimum value of 4.\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value. As $x$ approaches infinity, $x^4$ and $4x^2$ both approach infinity, so the function $q(x)$ also approaches infinity.\n\nTo find the range, we need to find the set of all values that $q(x)$ can take. Since the minimum value is 4 and there is no maximum value, the range is all values greater than or equal to 4.\n\nWe can write this as an interval: $[4, \\infty)$\n\nSo, the range of the function is $\\boxed{[4, \\infty)}$."
