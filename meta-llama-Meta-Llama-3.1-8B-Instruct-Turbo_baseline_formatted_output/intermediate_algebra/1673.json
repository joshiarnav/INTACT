    "problem": "If $a$ is a nonzero integer and $b$ is a positive number such that $ab^2=\\log_{10} b$, what is the median of the set $\\{0, 1, a, b,\n1/b\\}$?",
    "solution": "Because $b<10^b$ for all $b>0$, it follows that $\\log_{10}b<b$.  If $b\\geq 1$, then $0<\\left(\\log_{10}b\\right)/b^2<1$, so $a$ cannot be an integer. Therefore $0<b<1$, so $\\log_{10}b<0$ and $a =\n\\left(\\log_{10}b\\right)/b^2<0$.  Thus $a<0<b<1<1/b$, and the median of the set is $\\boxed{b}$.\n\nNote that the conditions of the problem can be met with $b = 0.1$ and $a = -100$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the median of the set, we need to first arrange the numbers in order. Since $0, 1,$ and $b$ are positive, $1/b$ will be a number between $1$ and $b$. Since $a$ can be either positive or negative, we are not sure where it will be in the order.\n\nHowever, we can use the given equation to get some information about $b$. The equation is $ab^2 = \\log_{10} b$. Since $\\log_{10} b$ is always positive, $ab^2$ must be positive. Since $a$ is nonzero, $b^2$ must be positive, so $b$ must be positive.\n\nSince $b$ is positive, we know that $1/b$ is positive and less than $1$. So the order of the numbers is $0, 1, 1/b, b, a$.\n\nSince there are an odd number of numbers in the set, the median is the middle number, which is $1/b$.\n\nTo find the value of $1/b$, we need more information. However, we can take a look at the original equation.\n\nSince we cannot solve for $b$ directly from the equation, we can try to find a restriction on $b$.\n\nWe know that $b^2 > 0$, so $b \\neq 0$.\n\nWe also divide both sides of the original equation by $b^2$ and we get \n$a=\\frac{\\log_{10} b}{b^2}$. This equation shows us that a=0 or b is not a solution to the equation."
