    "problem": "Given that $2+\\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the equation \\[x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10 = 0\\]and that $a$ and $b$ are rational numbers, compute $b.$",
    "solution": "Because the coefficients of the polynomial are rational, the radical conjugate $2-\\sqrt{3}$ must also be a root of the polynomial. By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of this polynomial is $-10,$ and the product of these two roots is $(2+\\sqrt3)(2-\\sqrt3) = 1,$ so the remaining root must be $\\frac{-10}{1} = -10.$ Then by Vieta's formulas again, we have \\[b = (-10)(2-\\sqrt3) + (-10)(2+\\sqrt3) + (2+\\sqrt3)(2-\\sqrt3) = \\boxed{-39}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "Since $2+\\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the polynomial, its conjugate $2-\\sqrt{3}$ must also be a root, as the coefficients of the polynomial are rational.\n\nThe product of these two roots is \\[ (2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3}) = 2^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1.\\] \n\nLet $r$ be the third root of the polynomial. By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of the polynomial is $-10.$ Therefore, \\[1 \\cdot r = -10 \\Rightarrow r = -10.\\]\n\nBy Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the polynomial is $-a.$ Hence, \\[(2+\\sqrt{3}) + (2-\\sqrt{3}) + (-10) = -a \\Rightarrow -8 = -a.\\]\n\nHence $a = 8.$\n\nNow, by Vieta's formulas, the sum of the pairwise products of the roots of the polynomial is $b.$ Hence, \\begin{align*}\nb &= (2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3}) + (2+\\sqrt{3})(-10) + (2-\\sqrt{3})(-10) \\\\\n&= 1 + (-20-\\sqrt{3}0) + (-20+\\sqrt{3}0) \\\\\n&= 1 - 40 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{-39}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, $b = \\boxed{-39}.$"
