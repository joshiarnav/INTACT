    "problem": "You have a rectangular prism box with length $x+5$ units, width $x-5$ units, and height $x^{2}+25$ units. For how many positive integer values of $x$ is the volume of the box less than 700 units?",
    "solution": "To find the volume of the box, we multiply the three dimensions: $(x+5)(x-5)(x^{2}+25) = (x^{2}-25)(x^{2}+25) = x^{4}-625$. We want to find $x$ such that $x^{4}-625<700$, which simplifies to $x^{4}<1325$. Taking the fourth root shows us that $x$ is less than $\\sqrt[4]{1325}$, which is between 6 and 7 (since $6^4=1296$ while $7^4=2401$). So $x$ could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, we see that the width is $x-5$ units, and this must be a positive number, so the only value of $x$ which works is 6. Thus, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ possible value of $x$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of the box, we need to multiply the length, width, and height together. \n\nVolume = (x+5)(x-5)(x^2+25)\n\nWe can simplify this by first multiplying (x+5) and (x-5) to get:\n\n(x+5)(x-5) = x^2 - 25\n\nSo, the volume becomes:\n\nVolume = (x^2 - 25)(x^2+25)\n\nWe can simplify this further by using the difference of squares identity:\n\n(x^2 - 25)(x^2+25) = x^4 - 625\n\nNow, we want to find the values of x for which the volume is less than 700. So, we set up the inequality:\n\nx^4 - 625 < 700\n\nWe can add 625 to both sides to get:\n\nx^4 < 1325\n\nNow, we need to find the positive integer values of x for which this inequality is true. \n\nWe know that x^4 < 1325, so x^4 must be less than a number that has 4 digits. This means x must be less than the cube root of 1325. \n\nThe cube root of 1325 is about 9.22, so x must be less than 9.22.\n\nSince x must be a positive integer, the possible values of x are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\nNow, we need to check if the width x-5 is positive for these values of x. \n\nx-5 > 0\nx > 5\n\nSo, the possible values of x are 6, 7, and 8.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ positive integer values of x for which the volume of the box is less than 700 units."
