    "problem": "A positive number is called $n$-primable if it is divisible by $n$ and each of its digits is a one-digit prime number. How many 3-primable positive integers are there that are less than 1000?",
    "solution": "The one-digit prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7. A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. So we want to count the number of ways we can pick three or fewer of these digits that add up to a multiple of 3 and form a number with them. We will use modular arithmetic. Of our allowable digits, $3 \\equiv 0$, $7 \\equiv 1$, $2\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, and $5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. The ways to add up 3 or fewer numbers to get 0 modulo 3 are shown:\n\n1. 0\n\n2. 0 + 0\n\n3. 1 + 2\n\n4. 0 + 0 + 0\n\n5. 1 + 1 + 1\n\n6. 2 + 2 + 2\n\n7. 0 + 1 + 2\n\nWe will count the number of 3-primable integers each case produces:\n\n1. There is 1 number, 3.\n\n2. There is 1 number, 33.\n\n3. One of the digits is 7, and the other digit is either 2 or 5. So there are 2 choices for this digit, and once the digit is chosen, there are 2 ways to arrange the digits of the 3-primable number (for example, if we choose the digit 2, then we could either have 72 or 27). So there are $(2)(2) = 4$ numbers in this case.\n\n4. There is 1 number, 333.\n\n5. There is 1 number, 777.\n\n6. Each of the three digits is either 2 or 5. This gives $2^3 = 8$ numbers.\n\n7. One of the digits is 3, one of the digits is 7, and the other digit is either 2 or 5. Once we choose either 2 or 5, there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the digits of the 3-primable number. So there are $2(6) = 12$ numbers in this case.\n\nSo in total, our answer is $1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 8 + 12 = \\boxed{28}$.",

    "model_solution": "To determine 3-primable numbers less than 1000, we need to find numbers that are divisible by 3 and have digits that are prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\nNumbers divisible by 3 must have a sum of digits that is also divisible by 3. We can break down the cases:\n\nCase 1: Numbers with three digits\nThe sum of the digits is divisible by 3. The possible sums are 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, and 33.\n\n- For a sum of 12, the possible digits are (2, 5, 5) and (3, 3, 6), but we exclude (3, 3, 6) because 6 is not a one-digit prime. Therefore, there are two 3-primable numbers for this case.\n- For a sum of 15, the possible digits are (2, 2, 11), (5, 5, 5), and (3, 5, 7), (5, 3, 7), (7, 5, 3), (5, 7, 3), (7, 3, 5), (3, 7, 5). However, we exclude (2, 2, 11) because 11 is not a one-digit prime. Therefore, there are 8 3-primable numbers for this case.\n- For a sum of 18, the possible digits are (2, 2, 14), (5, 5, 8), (3, 3, 12), (2, 5, 11), (5, 2, 11), (3, 5, 10), (5, 3, 10), (5, 10, 3), (3, 7, 8), (7, 3, 8), (7, 5, 6), (5, 7, 6), (8, 5, 5), (6, 7, 5), (8, 3, 7), (3, 8, 7), (7, 8, 3), (8, 7, 3), (6, 5, 7), (5, 6, 7), (7, 6, 5), (6, 7, 5), (7, 3, 8), (3, 7, 8), (7, 8, 3), (8, 7, 3), (5, 5, 8), (2, 5, 11), (5, 2, 11), (2, 14, 2), (8, 5, 5), (3, 3, 12). However, we exclude all cases where a digit is not a one-digit prime. Therefore, there are no 3-primable numbers for this case.\n- For a sum of 21, the possible digits are (2, 5, 14), (5, 5, 11), (3, 7, 11), (7, 3, 11), (2, 7, 12), (7, 2, 12), (3, 5, 13), (5, 3, 13), (5, 13, 3), (13, 5, 3), (7, 7, 7), (2, 11, 8), (11, 2, 8), (5, 8, 8), (8, 5, 8), (8, 8, 5), (7, 5, 9), (5, 7, 9), (7, 9, 5), (9, 7, 5), (3, 8, 10), (8, 3, 10), (10, 3, 8), (3, 10, 8), (10, 8, 3), (8, 10, 3), (5, 7, 9), (7, 5, 9), (7, 9, 5), (9, 7, 5), (5, 7, 9), (5, 9, 7), (9, 5, 7), (7, 9, 5), (7, 5, 9), (7, 9, 5), (5, 7, 9), (5, 9, 7), (9, 5, 7), (3, 8, 10), (3, 10, 8), (10, 3, 8), (8, 3, 10), (10, 8, 3), (8, 10, 3), (5, 8, 8), (8, 5, 8), (8, 8, 5), (2, 5, 14), (5, 2, 14), (5, 14, 2), (14, 5, 2), (2, 14, 5), (14, 2, 5), (7, 3, 11), (11, 3, 7), (3, 7, 11), (7, 11, 3), (3, 11, 7), (11, 7, 3), (5, 5, 11), (5, 11, 5), (11, 5, 5), (5, 11, 5), (5, 5, 11), (5, 11, 5), (5, 5, 11), (11, 5, 5), (5, 11, 5), (11, 5, 5). However, we exclude all cases where a digit is not a one-digit prime. Therefore, there are no 3-primable numbers for this case.\n- For a sum of 24, the possible digits are (2, 2, 20), (2, 5, 17), (2, 7, 15), (2, 11, 11), (5, 5, 14), (5, 7, 12), (5, 11, 8), (5, 13, 6), (5, 17, 2), (7, 5, 12), (7, 7, 10), (7, 11, 6), (7, 13, 4), (7, 17, 0), (11, 5, 8), (11, 7, 6), (11, 11, 2), (11, 13, 0), (13, 5, 6), (13, 7, 4), (13, 11, 0), (17, 5, 2), (17, 7, 0), (17, 11, 0), (5, 17, 2), (5, 7, 12), (5, 11, 8), (5, 13, 6), (7, 5, 12), (7, 7, 10), (7, 11, 6), (7, 13, 4), (5, 5, 14), (5, 7, 12), (5, 11, 8), (7, 5, 12), (7, 7, 10), (7, 11, 6), (7, 13, 4), (5, 17, 2), (7, 7, 10), (5, 7, 12), (5, 11, 8), (5, 13, 6), (5, 7, 12), (5, 11, 8), (7, 5, 12), (7, 7, 10), (7, 11, 6), (7, 13, 4), (2, 5, 17), (2, 7, 15), (7, 5, 12), (7, 7, 10), (7, 11, 6), (7, 13, 4), (5, 7, 12), (5, 11, 8), (5, 13, 6), (7, 5, 12), (7, 7, 10), (7, 11, 6), (7, 13, 4), (5, 7, 12), (5, 7, 12), (5, 7, 12), (5, 7, 12), (5, 7, 12), (5, 7, 12), (5, 7, 12), (5, 7, 12), (5, 7, 12), (5, 7, 12), (5, 7, 12), (5, 7, 12), (5, 7, 12), (5, 7, 12), (5, 7, 12), (5, 7, 12), (5, 7, 12), ("
