    "problem": "Find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.",
    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest three-digit number that is divisible by each of its distinct non-zero digits, we need to find a number that is divisible by all its digits.\n\nLet's consider the largest three-digit number, which is 999. We can try to find the largest number less than 999 that is divisible by each of its distinct non-zero digits.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. \n\nFor the number to be divisible by 8, the last three digits must be divisible by 8. \n\nFor the number to be divisible by 7, we can use the divisibility rule that the difference between twice the digit at the units place and the number formed by the remaining digits must be divisible by 7.\n\nLet's consider the largest possible digit for the hundreds place, which is 9. Then we consider the tens place and the units place.\n\nStarting from the largest possible number and working our way down, we can try to find a number that satisfies the conditions.\n\nLet's try 936. \n\nThe sum of the digits is 9 + 3 + 6 = 18, which is divisible by 9.\n\nThe last three digits are 936, which is divisible by 8.\n\nThe difference between twice the digit at the units place (6) and the number formed by the remaining digits (93) is 2 * 6 - 93 = -75, which is divisible by 7.\n\nTherefore, the largest three-digit number that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits is 936.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{936}$."
