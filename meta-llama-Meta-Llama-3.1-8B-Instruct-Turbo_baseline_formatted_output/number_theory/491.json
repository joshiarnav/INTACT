    "problem": "Marcus has two numbers, $a$ and $b$.  When he divides $a$ by 45 he gets a remainder of 37.  When he divides $b$ by 30 he gets a remainder of $9$.  What remainder does he get when he divides $a+b$ by 15?",
    "solution": "Marcus has two equations: \\[a=45n+37\\]and \\[b=30m+9.\\]When he adds these he gets \\[a+b=45n+30m+37+9=15(3n+2m)+46=15(3n+2m+3)+1.\\]The remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15 is $\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the remainder when Marcus divides $a$ by 45, we need to write $a$ in terms of 45 and a remainder. We can do this using the following equation:\n\n$$a = 45q_1 + r_1$$\n\nwhere $q_1$ is the quotient and $r_1$ is the remainder. Given that the remainder is 37, we have:\n\n$$a = 45q_1 + 37$$\n\nSimilarly, to find the remainder when Marcus divides $b$ by 30, we can write $b$ in terms of 30 and a remainder:\n\n$$b = 30q_2 + r_2$$\n\nwhere $q_2$ is the quotient and $r_2$ is the remainder. Given that the remainder is 9, we have:\n\n$$b = 30q_2 + 9$$\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when $a + b$ is divided by 15. To do this, we need to add $a$ and $b$:\n\n$$a + b = (45q_1 + 37) + (30q_2 + 9)$$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$$a + b = 45q_1 + 30q_2 + 46$$\n\nWe need to write 46 in terms of 15, since we are dividing by 15:\n\n$$46 = 15(3) + 1$$\n\nNow we can rewrite $a + b$ in terms of 15:\n\n$$a + b = 45q_1 + 30q_2 + 15(3) + 1$$\n\n$$a + b = 15(3q_1 + 2q_2) + 1$$\n\nIn this form, we can see that when $a + b$ is divided by 15, the remainder is 1.\n\n$\\boxed{1}$"
