    "problem": "Suppose that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are non-zero distinct digits less than $6$, and suppose we have ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$ and ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$. Find the three-digit number ${ABC}$. (Interpret $AB_6$ as a base-6 number with digits $A$ and $B$, not as $A$ times $B$. The other expressions should be interpreted in this way as well).",
    "solution": "Dealing with the second condition, it is set up in the following manner. $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&&C_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&0_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$Because $B+C$ can not equal $0$, we must carry in this column. Therefore, we arrive at two equations. $B+C-6=0$ and $A+1=C$ Looking at the third condition: $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&B&A_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&C_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$We can determine that no carrying occurs. Therefore, $A+B=C$. We now have a system of equations for our three variables. \\[B+C-6=0\\]\\[A+1=C\\]\\[A+B=C\\]Subtracting the third equation from the second, $1-B=0$, or $B=1$. Plugging that into our first equation we can determine that $C=5$. $A$ must then equal $4$. Thus, $\\overline{ABC}$ is $\\boxed{415}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve the problem, let's start with the equation: ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$. This can be rewritten as:\n\n$$6A+B+C = 6C+0_6$$\n\nSince $0_6$ is 0 in base 6, this simplifies to:\n\n$$6A+B+C=6C$$\n\nNow, let's look at the second equation: ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$. This can be rewritten as:\n\n$$(6A+B)+(6B+A)=(6C+C)$$\n\nCombine like terms and simplify:\n\n$$7A+7B=7C$$\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\n\n$$A+B=C$$\n\nNow we have two equations and three variables. We can use substitution to solve the system of equations.\n\nFrom the equation $A+B=C$, we can substitute $C$ with $A+B$ in the first equation:\n\n$$6A+B+A+B=6(A+B)$$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$$7A+2B=6A+6B$$\n\nSubtract $6A$ from both sides and subtract $2B$ from both sides:\n\n$$A=4B$$\n\nSince $A$ and $B$ are digits, the only possible values for $B$ are 1 and 2. If $B=1$, then $A=4$, which is not a valid digit. Therefore, $B=2$ and $A=4$.\n\nNow that we know the values of $A$ and $B$, we can find the value of $C$ using the equation $A+B=C$:\n\n$$4+2=6$$\n\nBut since this is base 6, the number $C$ can be up to 5, this means 6 wont be valid.\n\nLet's go back to the original problem and plug in the values we know:\n\n$${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$$\n\n$$4B+{C_6}={C}0_6$$\n\nSince $A=4$ and $B=2$, let's try $C=5$:\n\n$$42_6+5_6=50_6$$\n\nThis works, so the three-digit number ${ABC}$ is $425$."
