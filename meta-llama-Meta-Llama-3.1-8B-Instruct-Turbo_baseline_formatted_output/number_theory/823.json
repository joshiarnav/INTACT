    "problem": "Kaleb defined a $\\emph{clever integer}$ as an even integer that is greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9. What fraction of all clever integers is divisible by 27? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "You can easily list out the numbers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add to 9: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.\n\nTo be a $\\emph{clever integer}$ the number must be even, which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, a total of 5 numbers.\n\nThe problem asks which fraction of these five clever integers are divisible by 27. Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find clever integers that are divisible by 27, we need to find integers with a sum of digits 9 that are also multiples of 27. \n\nFirst, let's list all the multiples of 27 between 20 and 120: \n27, 54, 81, 108.\n\nNext, we'll check the sum of digits of each of these multiples:\n- 27: 2 + 7 = 9\n- 54: 5 + 4 = 9\n- 81: 8 + 1 = 9\n- 108: 1 + 0 + 8 = 9\n\nThese four numbers are all even and have a sum of digits equal to 9, so they are clever integers. \n\nTo determine the fraction of clever integers that are divisible by 27, we need to find the fraction of the given clever integers that are multiples of 27. Since all the clever integers (27, 54, 81, 108) are multiples of 27, the desired fraction is 4/4 = 1, or simply  $\\boxed{1}$"
