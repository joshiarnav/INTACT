    "problem": "For some positive integer $k$, when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. What is the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$?",
    "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$, we need to find the value of $k$ first. \n\nGiven that when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6, we can write it as: \n\n60 = $k^2$ * q + 6, where q is the quotient. \n\nWe know that $k^2$ * q is a multiple of $k^2$, so it can be written as $k^2$ * (a multiple of $k$). \n\n60 = $k^2$ * (a multiple of $k$) + 6\n\nSince 60 - 6 = 54 is a multiple of $k^2$, we can write: \n\n54 = $k^2$ * (a multiple of $k$)\n\nNow we need to find the factors of 54 that are perfect squares. \n\nThe factors of 54 are: \n1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54 \n\nAmong these factors, the perfect squares are: \n1, 9, 36, 54 \n\nHowever, since $k^2$ cannot be 1, 36, or 54, we have only one possible value for $k^2$, which is 9. \n\nTherefore, the possible value for $k$ is: \n$k = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nNow we need to find the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$. \n\n100 = 33 * 3 + 1 \n\nSo, the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$ is 1."
