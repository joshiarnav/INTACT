    "problem": "The arithmetic progressions $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$ and $\\{3, 10, 17, 24, \\ldots \\}$ have some common values. What is the largest value less than 500 that they have in common?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be a common term. We know that \\begin{align*}\na&\\equiv 2\\pmod 3\\\\\na&\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer such that $a=2+3n$. Substituting this into $(2)$ yields \\[2+3n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 5\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $5$. Then $n\\ge 5\\implies a=2+3n\\ge 17$. $17$ satisfies the original congruences, so it is the smallest common term. Subtracting $17$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align*}\na-17&\\equiv -15\\equiv 0\\pmod 3\\nonumber\\\\\na-17&\\equiv -14\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\\nonumber\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,7)$, we get $a-17\\equiv 0\\pmod{3\\cdot 7}$, that is, $a\\equiv 17\\pmod{21}$.\n\nSo all common terms must be of the form $17+21m$ for some non-negative integer $m$. Note that any number of the form also satisfies the original congruences. The largest such number less than $500$ is $17+21\\cdot 22=\\boxed{479}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the common terms in both arithmetic progressions, we need to find the first term where the two progressions intersect.\n\nFirst, we notice the general form of each arithmetic progression. The first progression follows the form $2 + 3n$, while the second follows the form $3 + 7n$. \n\nNow to find a common value, we can set the two expressions equal to each other and solve for $n$:\n\n$$2 + 3n = 3 + 7n$$\n\nSubtract $3n$ from both sides:\n\n$$2 = 3 + 4n$$\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n$$-1 = 4n$$\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n$$-\\frac{1}{4} = n$$\n\nSince $n$ must be an integer, there is no solution for $n$ in this case. However, we can solve for a common term by finding the smallest $n$ for which $2+3n$ is a multiple of $7$. This can be represented as the equation:\n\n$$2+3n = 7m$$\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n$$3n = 7m - 2$$\n\nTo find when $3n$ is a multiple of 7, we can also rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$3n = 7m - 2$$\n\nSince we are dealing with integers, we can solve this by trial and error.\n\nFor $m=2$, we get:\n\n$$n = \\frac{7m-2}{3} = \\frac{14-2}{3} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4.$$\n\nPlugging in $n=4$ into the first arithmetic progression, we get:\n\n$$2 + 3n = 2 + 3(4) = 2 + 12 = 14.$$\n\nHowever, to ensure that the common term follows the form of the second arithmetic progression, we need to check if $14$ is a term of the second progression. \n\nThe second progression has the form $3 + 7n$. Plugging in $n=1$, we get $3 + 7(1) = 10$, which is in the progression. \n\nNow, we can check if $n=1$ yields a term that is equal to a term of the first progression. Plugging $n=1$ into the first progression, we get $2 + 3(1) = 5$, which is in the progression.\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the common term that follows the form of both progressions and is less than 500, we can find a general solution for the common term. \n\nLet $n$ be the smallest integer such that $2+3n$ is a multiple of $7$. The common terms in both progressions will be given by $2+3n$, where $n$ is a multiple of $7$ minus $2$, and $n$ is an integer. \n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n$$n = \\frac{7m-2}{3}$$\n\nWe want $n$ to be an integer, so we need to find the smallest integer $m$ that makes $\\frac{7m-2}{3}$ an integer.\n\nWe can start checking for integer values of $n$ by plugging in different integer values of $m$. \n\nFor $m=2$ we get:\n\n$$n = \\frac{7m-2}{3} = \\frac{14-2}{3} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4$$\n\nHowever, we need to find a value of $m$ that is a multiple of 3. This is because when $m$ is a multiple of 3, $7m$ is also a multiple of 3, and when we divide a multiple of 3 by 3, we get an integer.\n\nLet's check for $m=6$. This is a multiple of 3. When we plug in $m=6$ into the equation:\n\n$$n = \\frac{7m-2}{3} = \\frac{7(6)-2}{3} = \\frac{42-2}{3} = \\frac{40}{3}$$\n\nThis is not an integer.\n\nHowever, we can try $m=9$. This is also a multiple of 3. When we plug in $m=9$ into the equation:\n\n$$n = \\frac{7m-2}{3} = \\frac{7(9)-2}{3} = \\frac{63-2}{3} = \\frac{61}{3}$$\n\nThis is not an integer.\n\nHowever, we can try $m=12$.

This is also a multiple of 3. When we plug in $m=33$ into the equation:\n\n$$n = \\frac{7m-2}{3} = \\frac{7(33)-2}{3} = \\frac{231-2}{3} = \\frac{229}{3}$$\n\nThis is not an integer.\n\nHowever, we can try $m=36$.
