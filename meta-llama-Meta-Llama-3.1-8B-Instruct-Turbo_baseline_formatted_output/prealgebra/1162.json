    "problem": "Chloe wants to buy a hoodie that costs $\\$32.75$. She empties her wallet and finds she only has three $\\$10$ bills, eight quarters, and a pile of dimes. What is the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ represent the unknown number of dimes. Chloe's total amount of money is $$3(\\$10)+8(\\$.25)+n(\\$.10) \\ge \\$32.75.$$Simplifying gives  \\begin{align*}\n30+2+.10n &\\ge 32.75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\n.10n &\\ge .75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge \\frac{.75}{.10} \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge 7.5.\n\\end{align*}Chloe must have at least $\\boxed{8}$ dimes in her pile.",
