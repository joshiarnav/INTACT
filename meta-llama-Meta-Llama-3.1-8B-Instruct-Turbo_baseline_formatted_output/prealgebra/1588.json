    "problem": "The product of three different positive integers is equal to $7^3$. What is the sum of the three integers?",
    "solution": "All three integers must be divisors of $7^3$.  The only divisors of $7^3$ are $7^0$, $7^1$, $7^2$, $7^3$.  We have $7^3=7^0\\times7^1\\times7^2$. Thus our answer is $7^0+7^1+7^2=1+7+49=\\boxed{57}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the three integers, we need to find the prime factorization of $7^3$. \n\nThe prime factorization of $7^3$ is $7 * 7 * 7$.\n\nSince we need three different positive integers, we can take $1, 7,$ and $49$ as the three integers. \n\nThe sum of the three integers is $1 + 7 + 49 = 57$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the three integers is $\\boxed{57}$."
