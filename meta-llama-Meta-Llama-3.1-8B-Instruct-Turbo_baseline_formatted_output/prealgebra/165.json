    "model_solution": "To find the average monthly balance, we first need to find the total balance. The graph shows that the account balance was $100 in January, $200 in February, $150 in March, and $150 in April. \n\nThe total balance is $100 + $200 + $150 + $150 = $600.\n\nWe are averaging this over a four-month period. The average can be calculated by dividing the total balance by the number of months. \n\nThe average monthly balance is $600 / 4 = $150.\n\nSo, the average monthly balance is $150."
