    "problem": "In order to compute the area of a particular circle, Juan first measures the length of its diameter. The actual diameter is 20 cm, but Juan's measurement has an error of up to $20\\%$. What is the largest possible percent error, in percent, in Juan's computed area of the circle?",
    "solution": "Juan can measure the diameter as a length anywhere between $20 - 20\\cdot 0.2 = 16$ and $20 + 20\\cdot 0.2 = 24$  cm. The actual area of the circle is $\\pi (20/2)^2=100\\pi$ square cm, but Juan can compute the area anywhere in the range $\\pi (16/2)^2=64 \\pi$ square cm to $\\pi (24/2)^2=144 \\pi$ square cm. Using the lower bound of the range, Juan's error is $(100\\pi - 64\\pi)/(100\\pi)=36\\%$. Using the upper bound of the range, Juan's error is $(144\\pi - 100\\pi)/(100\\pi)=44\\%$. Thus, the largest possible percent error is $\\boxed{44}$ percent.",

    "model_solution": "To find the largest possible percent error in Juan's computed area of the circle, we need to first find the true area of the circle and the largest possible area using Juan's measurement.\n\nThe true area of the circle is given by the formula:\n\nA_true = \u03c0r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter of the circle is 20 cm, the radius is 10 cm. \n\nA_true = \u03c0(10)^2\n= 100\u03c0\n\nNow, let's consider the largest possible measurement error of 20%. This means that Juan's measurement of the diameter can be up to 20% more than the actual diameter. \n\nThe largest possible diameter measured by Juan is:\n20 cm + (20% of 20 cm)\n= 20 cm + 0.2(20 cm)\n= 20 cm + 4 cm\n= 24 cm\n\nThe largest possible area computed by Juan is:\nA_juan = \u03c0r^2\nwhere r is the radius of the circle, which is half of the diameter measured by Juan.\nr = 24 cm / 2\n= 12 cm\n\nA_juan = \u03c0(12)^2\n= 144\u03c0\n\nTo find the percent error, we need to find the difference between the largest possible area computed by Juan and the true area, and divide it by the true area.\n\nPercent Error = ((A_juan - A_true) / A_true) * 100\n= ((144\u03c0 - 100\u03c0) / 100\u03c0) * 100\n= (44\u03c0 / 100\u03c0) * 100\n= 44%\n\nTherefore, the largest possible percent error in Juan's computed area of the circle is 44%.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{44}$."
