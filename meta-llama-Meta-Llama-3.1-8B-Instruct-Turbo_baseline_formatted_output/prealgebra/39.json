    "problem": "In pentagon $MATHS$, $\\angle M \\cong \\angle T \\cong \\angle H$ and $\\angle A$ is supplementary to $\\angle S$. How many degrees are in the measure of $\\angle H$?",
    "solution": "The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so we must have \\[\\angle M + \\angle A + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle S = 540^\\circ.\\] Since $\\angle A$ and $\\angle S$ are supplementary, we have $\\angle A +\\angle S = 180^\\circ$.  Combining this with $\\angle H = \\angle M = \\angle T$, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\angle M + \\angle A + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle S& =\n(\\angle M + \\angle T + \\angle H) \\\\\n&\\qquad+ (\\angle A +\\angle S) \\\\\n&= 3\\angle H + 180^\\circ,\\end{align*} so $3\\angle H + 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ$.  Therefore, $3\\angle H = 360^\\circ$ and $\\angle H = \\boxed{120^\\circ}$.",

    "model_solution": "In a pentagon, the sum of the interior angles is given by the formula (n-2)*180, where n is the number of sides. Since a pentagon has 5 sides, the sum of the interior angles is (5-2)*180 = 540 degrees.\n\nWe are given that $\\angle M \\cong \\angle T \\cong \\angle H$, so we can let the measure of each of these angles be x. We are also given that $\\angle A$ is supplementary to $\\angle S$, so the sum of $\\angle A$ and $\\angle S$ is 180 degrees. Let the measure of $\\angle A$ be y and the measure of $\\angle S$ be 180-y.\n\nThe sum of all the angles in the pentagon is 540 degrees, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx + x + x + y + (180-y) = 540\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x + 180 = 540\n\nSubtract 180 from both sides:\n\n3x = 360\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 120\n\nSince x is the measure of $\\angle H$, the measure of $\\angle H$ is 120 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{120}$."
