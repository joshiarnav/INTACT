    "problem": "What is the sum of the prime factors of 91?",
    "solution": "Since 91 is not divisible by the first three prime numbers, we try dividing $91\\div 7$.  We find a quotient of 13, so $91=7\\times 13$ and the sum of these prime factors is $7+13=\\boxed{20}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the sum of the prime factors of 91, we need to find its prime factors first. \n\n91 can be divided by 7 (a prime number), so 91 = 7 * 13 (another prime number). \n\nTherefore, the prime factors of 91 are 7 and 13. \n\nThe sum of the prime factors of 91 is 7 + 13 = 20.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{20}$."
