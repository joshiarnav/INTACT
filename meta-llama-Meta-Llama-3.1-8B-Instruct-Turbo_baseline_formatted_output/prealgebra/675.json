    "problem": "The average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $4x-7$. What is $x$?",
    "solution": "The average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ is $\\dfrac{1}{3}((x+6)+(6x+2)+(2x+7))$. Simplifying this expression gives $\\dfrac{1}{3}(9x+15)=3x+5$. We know the average is also $4x-7$, so $3x+5=4x-7$. Subtracting $3x-7$ from both sides of this equation gives $x=\\boxed{12}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the average of three numbers, we add them together and divide by 3. \n\nThe average of $x+6$, $6x+2$, and $2x+7$ can be represented as:\n$\\frac{(x+6) + (6x+2) + (2x+7)}{3}$\n\nWe are given that this average is equal to $4x-7$. So we can set up the equation:\n\n$\\frac{(x+6) + (6x+2) + (2x+7)}{3} = 4x-7$\n\nFirst, let's simplify the left side of the equation by combining like terms:\n\n$\\frac{x+6+6x+2+2x+7}{3} = 4x-7$\n\n$\\frac{9x+15}{3} = 4x-7$\n\nNow, let's simplify the left side of the equation by dividing the numerator by 3:\n\n$3x+5 = 4x-7$\n\nNext, let's isolate $x$ by subtracting $3x$ from both sides of the equation:\n\n$5 = x-7$\n\nNow, let's add 7 to both sides of the equation to solve for $x$:\n\n$12 = x$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{12}$."
