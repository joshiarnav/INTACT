    "solution": "Since the point lies in the $xz$-plane, it is of the form $(x,0,z).$  We want this point to be equidistant to the points $(1,-1,0),$ $(2,1,2),$ and $(3,2,-1),$ which gives us the equations\n\\begin{align*}\n(x - 1)^2 + 1^2 + z^2 &= (x - 2)^2 + 1^2 + (z - 2)^2, \\\\\n(x - 1)^2 + 1^2 + z^2 &= (x - 3)^2 + 2^2 + (z + 1)^2.\n\\end{align*}These equations simplify to $2x + 4z = 7$ and $4x - 2z = 12.$  Solving these equation, we find $x = \\frac{31}{10}$ and $z = \\frac{1}{5},$ so the point we seek is $\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{31}{10}, 0, \\frac{1}{5} \\right)}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the point in the $xz$-plane that is equidistant from the given points, we need to consider the distance between points in 3D space. \n\nLet the point in the $xz$-plane be $(x,0,z)$. \n\nThe distance between $(1,-1,0)$ and $(x,0,z)$ is $\\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + z^2}$.\n\nThe distance between $(2,1,2)$ and $(x,0,z)$ is $\\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + (z-2)^2}$.\n\nThe distance between $(3,2,-1)$ and $(x,0,z)$ is $\\sqrt{(x-3)^2 + (z+1)^2}$.\n\nSince the point $(x,0,z)$ is equidistant from these three points, we can set up the following equation:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + z^2} = \\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + (z-2)^2} = \\sqrt{(x-3)^2 + (z+1)^2}\n$$\n\nWe can square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n\n$$\n(x-1)^2 + z^2 = (x-2)^2 + (z-2)^2 = (x-3)^2 + (z+1)^2\n$$\n\nExpanding the left side of the first equation:\n\n$$\nx^2 - 2x + 1 + z^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 + z^2 - 4z + 4\n$$\n\nSimplifying the equation by canceling out the $x^2$ and $z^2$ terms:\n\n$$\n-2x + 1 = -4x + 8 - 4z\n$$\n\nMoving the $-4x$ term to the left side of the equation:\n\n$$\n2x - 4x + 1 = 8 - 4z\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\n-2x + 1 = 8 - 4z\n$$\n\nMoving the constant term to the right side of the equation:\n\n$$\n-2x = 7 - 4z\n$$\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by $-2$:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{4z - 7}{2}\n$$\n\nNow, let's consider the second and third equations.
