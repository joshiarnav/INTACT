    "model_solution": "To find the number of x-intercepts of the function $y = \\sen \\frac{1}{x}$ in the interval $(0.0001, 0.001)$, we need to find the values of $x$ such that $\\sin\\frac{1}{x} = 0$.\n\nThe function $\\sin \\frac{1}{x}$ will have x-intercepts whenever $\\frac{1}{x}$ is an integer multiple of $\\pi$, as those are the points where the sine function is equal to zero.\n\nSo, we need to find the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $\\frac{1}{x} = k\\pi$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as $x = \\frac{1}{k\\pi}$.\n\nWe are interested in the values of $k$ for which $x$ falls within the interval $(0.0001, 0.001)$.\n\nWe can write the inequality as $0.0001 < \\frac{1}{k\\pi} < 0.001$.\n\nMultiplying the inequality by $k\\pi$ (which is positive for positive $k$), we get $0.0001k\\pi < 1 < 0.001k\\pi$.\n\nDividing the inequality by $0.0001\\pi$ and $0.001\\pi$ respectively, we get $\\frac{1000}{\\pi} < k < \\frac{10,000}{\\pi}$.\n\nSolving the inequality, we find that $318.3 < k < 3183.1$.\n\nTherefore, the number of x-intercepts is the number of integers in the interval $(318, 3183)$.\n\nWe can find this number by subtracting the lower limit from the upper limit and adding 1.\n\nSo, the number of x-intercepts is $3183 - 318 + 1 = 2866$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{2866}$."
