    "model_solution": "To find the angle between the vectors $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, we need to understand the relationship between the original angle and the new angle.\n\nThe angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ will be the same as the angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $-\\mathbf{b}$ (due to symmetry). This new angle can be found using the relationship $\\theta' = 180^\\circ - \\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the original angle.\n\nHowever, we want to find the angle between $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$. This angle can also be found by subtracting the original angle from $180^\\circ$. This gives us:\n\n$\\theta' = 180^\\circ - 43^\\circ = 137^\\circ$\n\nSo, the angle between the vectors $-\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is $\\boxed{137}$ degrees."
