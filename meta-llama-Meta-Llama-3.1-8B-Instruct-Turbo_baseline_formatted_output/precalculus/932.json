    "model_solution": "To find the range of the function $y=\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\cos x})$, we need to consider the possible values of $\\cos x$ and then apply the logarithm.\n\nSince $-90^\\circ< x < 90^\\circ$, we have $0< \\cos x \\le 1$ because the cosine function is non-negative in this interval. The square root of any non-negative number is non-negative, so $0 \\le \\sqrt{\\cos x} \\le 1$.\n\nSince $\\log_2(0)$ is undefined, we exclude the case where $\\sqrt{\\cos x} = 0$. This means that the input to the logarithm is always positive.\n\nFor $0 < a \\le 1$, the logarithm $\\log_2(a)$ is a negative number. This is because $2^{-1} = 1/2$ and $2^{-2} = 1/4$ are both smaller than $a$, and the logarithm is an increasing function.\n\nTherefore, the range of the function is all negative numbers less than or equal to zero. In interval notation, this is written as $(-\\infty, 0]$.\n\nHowever, I will continue the instructions given. \n\n$\\boxed{(-\\infty,0]}$"
