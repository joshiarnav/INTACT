    "solution": "We know that by definition, $i^2=-1$, so $i^4=(-1)^2=1.$ More generally, for all integers k, $i^{4k}=(i^4)^k=1^k=1$. This means that $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}= i^8(i^3)+i^{16}(1)+i^{20}(i)+i^{24}(i^2)+i^{28}(i^3)=i^3+1+i+i^2+i^3$. Since $i^3=-i$, we can simplify this to get our final result: $i^{11} + i^{16} + i^{21} + i^{26} + i^{31}=-i+1+i-1-i=\\boxed{-i}.$",

    "model_solution": "To evaluate this expression, we need to first simplify each term. Recall that i is defined as the imaginary unit, where i^2 = -1.\n\n1. i^11: \n   We can rewrite i^11 as (i^2)^5 * i, because 11 = 8 + 2 + 1. Since i^2 = -1, we have (i^2)^5 = (-1)^5. Therefore, i^11 = -i.\n\n2. i^16: \n   Since i^2 = -1, we have i^4 = (i^2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1. Therefore, i^16 = (i^4)^4 = 1^4 = 1.\n\n3. i^21: \n   We can rewrite i^21 as (i^4)^5 * i. Since i^4 = 1, we have (i^4)^5 = 1^5 = 1. Therefore, i^21 = 1 * i = i.\n\n4. i^26: \n   Since i^4 = 1, we can rewrite i^26 as i^2 * (i^4)^6. We have i^2 = -1 and (i^4)^6 = 1^6 = 1. Therefore, i^26 = -1 * 1 = -1.\n\n5. i^31: \n   We can rewrite i^31 as (i^4)^7 * i^3. Since i^4 = 1, we have (i^4)^7 = 1^7 = 1. Also, i^3 = i^2 * i = -1 * i = -i. Therefore, i^31 = 1 * -i = -i.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the expression:\ni^11 + i^16 + i^21 + i^26 + i^31\n= -i + 1 + i - 1 - i\n= -i + i + 1 - 1 - i\n= -i - i\n= -2i.\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is -2i."
