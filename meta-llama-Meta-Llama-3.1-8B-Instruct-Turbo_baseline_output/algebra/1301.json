    "problem": "Phoenix hiked the Rocky Path Trail last week. It took four days to complete the trip. The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles. The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day. The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles. The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles. How many miles long was the trail?",
    "solution": "Let the number of miles Phoenix hiked in each day be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=22\\\\\n(b+c)/2=13 \\Rightarrow b+c&=26\\\\\nc+d&=30\\\\\na+c&=26\n\\end{align*} Notice that we do not have to solve for any of the variables. We can add $a + b = 22$ to $c + d = 30$ and find that $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52.$ Therefore, the entire trail was $\\boxed{52}$ miles long.",

    "model_solution": "To find the total length of the trail, we can use the following variables: \n- a = miles hiked on the first day\n- b = miles hiked on the second day\n- c = miles hiked on the third day\n- d = miles hiked on the fourth day\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following equations:\n1. a + b = 22\n2. b + c = 26 (since b and c are the average of 13 miles per day, then b + c = 26)\n3. c + d = 30\n4. a + c = 26\n\nFrom equation 2, we know that b + c = 26, but we can also use equation 1 to express b in terms of a: b = 22 - a.\nSubstituting this into equation 2, we get: 22 - a + c = 26, or c - a = 4.\n\nWe can solve the system of equations using the following steps:\n- From equations 1 and 4, we have: a + b = 22 and a + c = 26. By subtracting the first equation from the second, we get: c - b = 4.\n- We know that c - a = 4 and c - b = 4. Therefore, a = b.\n\nSubstituting a = b into the equation a + b = 22, we get: 2b = 22 or b = 11.\n\nSubstituting b = 11 into the equation c - b = 4, we get: c = 15.\n\nWe know that c - a = 4 and c = 15. Therefore, a = 11.\n\nWe know that c + d = 30 and c = 15. Therefore, d = 15.\n\nNow we have all the values: a = 11, b = 11, c = 15, and d = 15. The total length of the trail is a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52.\n\nThe total length of the trail is 52 miles."
