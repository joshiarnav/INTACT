    "solution": "First, we can factor out $1000=10^3$, so $\\sqrt[3]{2744000}=10\\sqrt[3]{2744}$.  To proceed, we can take out factors of two from 2744, to find that $2744=2\\cdot1372=2\\cdot2\\cdot686=2^3\\cdot343$.  With a little bit of guess and check, notice that $7^3=343$.  Therefore, $10\\sqrt[3]{2744}=10(14)=\\boxed{140}$.",
