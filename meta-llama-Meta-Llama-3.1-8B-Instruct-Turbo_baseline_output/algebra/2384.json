    "problem": "What is the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double?",
    "solution": "From the information given, we have $x^2 = 2x + 48$. Rearranging, we get $x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$, which we can factor as $(x+6)(x-8) = 0$. Therefore, $x = -6\\text{ or }8$.  Since we want the lesser, $\\boxed{-6}$ is our answer.",

    "model_solution": "Let's call the integer 'x'. The square of the integer is x^2 and its double is 2x. \n\nAccording to the problem, the square of the integer is 48 more than its double, which can be expressed as:\n\nx^2 = 2x + 48\n\nRearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 48 = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve this quadratic equation to find the value of 'x'. \n\nWe can factor the equation:\n\n(x - 8)(x + 6) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible values for 'x':\n\nx - 8 = 0\nx + 6 = 0\n\nSolving for 'x' in both cases:\n\nx = 8\nx = -6\n\nSince the problem asks for the least integer, we choose the smallest value, which is -6.\n\nTherefore, the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double is -6."
