    "problem": "What is the sum of all values of $k$ such that the equation $2x^2-kx+8=0$ has two distinct integer solutions?",
    "solution": "We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively. Let the two roots of the equation be $p$ and $q$. Then $p+q=k/2$. However the only other restriction on $p$ and $q$ is that $pq = 4$ and that $p$ and $q$ are distinct integers. For each such possibility $(p,q)$, we also have the possibility $(-p,-q)$ since $(-p)(-q) = pq = 4$. This gives two values of $k$: $k=2(p+q)$ and $k=2(-p-q)$. Since these occur in such pairs, the sum of all possible values of $k$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nAlternatively, one can note that the only way to factor 4 into 2 distinct integer factors is $4\\cdot1$ and $(-4)(-1)$, so that the two possible values of $k$ are $10$ and $-10$, given a sum of $0$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the sum of all values of k such that the equation 2x^2 - kx + 8 = 0 has two distinct integer solutions, we can use Vieta's formulas, which state that for a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 with roots x1 and x2, the following relationships hold:\n\nx1 + x2 = -b/a\nx1*x2 = c/a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -k, and c = 8. \n\nSince the solutions are distinct integers, we can express the solutions as m and n, where m \u2260 n and m, n \u2208 \u2124. Then, we have:\nm + n = -(-k)/2 = k/2\nmn = 8/2 = 4\n\nNow we need to find all pairs of distinct integers m and n whose product is 4. \n\nThe pairs (m, n) are (-4, -1), (-4, 1), (-1, -4), (-1, 4), (4, -1), (4, 1), (1, -4), (1, 4). \n\nEach pair gives a different value of k, which can be calculated as k = 2(m + n). \n\nThe values of k corresponding to each pair are: \n-2((-4) + (-1)) = 2(10) = 10\n-2((-4) + (1)) = -2(-3) = 6 \n-2((-1) + (-4)) = -2(-5) = 10 \n-2((-1) + (4)) = -2(3) = -6 \n2((4) + (-1)) = 2(3) = 6 \n2((4) + (1)) = 2(5) = 10 \n2((1) + (-4)) = 2(-3) = -6 \n2((1) + (4)) = 2(5) = 10\n\nIf we remove the duplicates from the set of values of k, we have {6, 10, -6}. \n\nThe sum of all values of k is 6 + 10 + (-6) = 10.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all values of k such that the equation 2x^2 - kx + 8 = 0 has two distinct integer solutions is 10."
