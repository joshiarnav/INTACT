    "problem": "The vertex of the parabola described by the equation $y=-3x^2-30x-81$ is $(m,n)$. What is $n$?",
    "solution": "We will complete the square on the given quadratic expression to find the vertex. Factoring $-3$ from the first two terms, we have \\[y=-3(x^2+10x)-81\\]In order to make the expression inside the parentheses a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(10/2)^2=25$ inside the parentheses. Doing this, we get \\[y=-3(x^2+10x+25-25)-81 = -3(x+5)^2-6\\]The graph of an equation of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ is a parabola with vertex at $(h,k)$, so the vertex of our parabola is at $(-5,-6)$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{-6}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the vertex of the parabola, we need to rewrite the equation in the form $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex.\n\nGiven equation: $y = -3x^2 - 30x - 81$\n\nFirst, we factor out the coefficient of $x^2$: \n$y = -3(x^2 + 10x) - 81$\n\nTo complete the square, we add $(10/2)^2 = 5^2 = 25$ inside the parentheses:\n$y = -3(x^2 + 10x + 25) - 81 + 3(25)$\n\nSimplifying:\n$y = -3(x + 5)^2 - 81 + 75$\n$y = -3(x + 5)^2 - 6$\n\nNow the equation is in the form $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex.\nComparing this with the given equation, we can see that the vertex is $(-5, -6)$.\n\nTherefore, $n = -6$."
