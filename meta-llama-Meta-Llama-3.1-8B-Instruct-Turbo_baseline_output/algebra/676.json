    "problem": "If a rectangular prism has a length of $l$, a width of $w$, and a height of $h$, then the length of its diagonal is equal to $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}$. Suppose $l = 3$ and $h = 12$; if the length of the diagonal is $13$, what is the width?",
    "solution": "We are given that $$\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + w^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{153 + w^2} = 13.$$Squaring both sides, it follows that $$153 + w^2 = 13^2 = 169 \\quad\\Longrightarrow \\quad w = \\pm 4.$$Since the width must be a positive quantity, the answer is $\\boxed{4}$.",
