    "problem": "Anton has two species of ants, Species A and Species B, in his ant farm. The two species are identical in appearance, but Anton knows that every day, there are twice as many ants of Species A than before, while there are three times as many ants of Species B. On Day 0, Anton counts that there are 30 ants in his ant farm. On Day 5, Anton counts that there are 3281 ants in his ant farm. How many of these are of Species A?",
    "solution": "Suppose that there are $a$ ants of Species A and $b$ ants of Species B on Day 0. We thus have that $a+b=30$. Notice that on Day 1, there will be $2a$ ants of Species A, on Day 2, there will be $2(2a) = 4a$ ants of Species A, and on Day 3, there will be $2(4a)=8a$ ants of Species A, etc. Following this line of reasoning, on Day 5, there will be $2^5a$ ants of Species A and $3^5b$ ants of Species B, meaning that $32a+243b=3281$. We now solve this system of linear equations. We have that $32a+32b=960$, so \\begin{align*}(32a+243b)-(32a+32b) &= 211b \\\\\n&= 3281-960 \\\\\n&= 2321.\\end{align*}We then have $b = \\frac{2321}{211} = 11$. This means that $a=30-11=19$, and there are $32\\cdot 19 = \\boxed{608}$ ants of Species A on Day 5.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's denote the initial number of ants of Species A as 'a' and the initial number of ants of Species B as 'b'. We know that a + b = 30.\n\nWe also know that the number of ants of Species A doubles every day, and the number of ants of Species B triples every day. \n\nOn Day 5, the number of ants of Species A is 2^5 * a = 32a, and the number of ants of Species B is 3^5 * b = 243b.\n\nWe are given that on Day 5, the total number of ants is 3281, so we can write the equation 32a + 243b = 3281.\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1. a + b = 30\n2. 32a + 243b = 3281\n\nWe can solve these equations using substitution or elimination. \n\nLet's use substitution:\n\nFrom equation 1, we get b = 30 - a.\n\nSubstituting this into equation 2, we get:\n32a + 243(30 - a) = 3281\n32a + 7290 - 243a = 3281\n-211a = -4009\na = 19\n\nNow we can find the initial number of ants of Species B:\nb = 30 - a = 30 - 19 = 11\n\nHowever, we want to find the number of ants of Species A on Day 5. We know that there are 32 times as many ants of Species A as on Day 0, so the number of ants of Species A on Day 5 is 32a = 32(19) = 608.\n\nTherefore, the number of ants of Species A on Day 5 is 608."
