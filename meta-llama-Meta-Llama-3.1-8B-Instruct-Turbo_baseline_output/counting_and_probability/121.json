    "problem": "Two standard dice are rolled. What is the expected number of 1's obtained? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability of rolling a number other than 1 on one die is $\\frac{5}{6}$, so the probability of rolling zero 1's on two dice is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{36}$. The probability of rolling a 1 on one die is $\\frac{1}{6}$, so the probability of rolling 1's on two dice (for a total of two 1's) is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{36}$. Since the only other possibility is rolling exactly one 1, the probability of rolling one 1 is $1-\\frac{25}{36}-\\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{10}{36}$. We find the expected number of 1's to be $E = \\frac{1}{36} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{10}{36} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{25}{36} \\cdot 0 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "When two dice are rolled, there are 6 possible outcomes for each die (1 through 6), giving a total of 36 possible outcomes for two dice.\n\nLet's consider each case:\n\n- There are 11 outcomes (11,1), (1,11) (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (3,1) (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) where exactly one die shows a 1.\n- There is 1 outcome (1,1) where both dice show a 1.\n\nTo find the expected number of 1's, we need to multiply each outcome by its probability and then add them up.\n\nFor exactly one 1:\n- (1/6) * 11 = 11/6\nFor two 1's:\n- (1/36)\n\nSo the expected number of 1's is the sum of these two cases:\n- (11/6) + (1/36)\n\nTo add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 36. We can rewrite 11/6 as 66/36.\n\n- (66/36) + (1/36) = (67/36)\n\nSo the expected number of 1's is 67/36."
