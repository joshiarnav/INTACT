    "solution": "There are 8 Republicans and 3 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ ways to choose the Republicans.  There are 6 Democrats and 2 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose the Democrats.  So there are $56 \\times 15 = \\boxed{840}$ ways to choose the subcommittee.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of ways to form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats, we can use the concept of combinations.\n\nFor the Republicans:\nThere are 8 Republicans, and we need to choose 3 of them. This can be done in 8C3 ways, where 8C3 represents the number of combinations of 8 items taken 3 at a time.\n\n8C3 = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n= 8! / (3!5!)\n= (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / ((3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)(5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1))\n= (8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)\n= 56\n\nFor the Democrats:\nThere are 6 Democrats, and we need to choose 2 of them. This can be done in 6C2 ways.\n\n6C2 = 6! / (2!(6-2)!)\n= 6! / (2!4!)\n= (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / ((2 \u00d7 1)(4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1))\n= (6 \u00d7 5) / (2 \u00d7 1)\n= 15\n\nThe total number of ways to form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats is the product of the number of ways to choose the Republicans and the number of ways to choose the Democrats.\n\nTotal ways = 8C3 \u00d7 6C2\n= 56 \u00d7 15\n= 840\n\nTherefore, there are 840 ways to form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats."
