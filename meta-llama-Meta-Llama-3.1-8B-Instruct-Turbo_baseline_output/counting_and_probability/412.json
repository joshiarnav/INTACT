    "problem": "How many distinct triangles can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube? (Two triangles are distinct if they have different locations in space.)",
    "solution": "There are eight vertices of a cube, and we choose three of these to form a triangle. Thus, the number of distinct triangles that can be formed is $\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8\\cdot7\\cdot6}{3\\cdot2} = \\boxed{56}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of distinct triangles that can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube, we need to use combinatorics. \n\nA cube has 8 vertices. To form a triangle, we need to choose 3 of these vertices. This can be done in 8 choose 3, or 8C3, ways. \n\nThe formula for n choose k is given by:\n\nnCk = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 8 and k = 3.\n\nSo,\n\n8C3 = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!)\n= 8! / (3! * 5!)\n= (8*7*6) / (3*2*1)\n= 56\n\nTherefore, there are 56 distinct triangles that can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube."
