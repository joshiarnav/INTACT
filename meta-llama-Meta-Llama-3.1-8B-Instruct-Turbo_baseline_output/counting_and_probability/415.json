    "problem": "The numbers from 1 to 150, inclusive, are placed in a bag and a number is randomly selected from the bag. What is the probability it is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "It is easier to count the number of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. We see there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150, namely $1^{2}, 2^{2}, \\ldots, 12^{2}$, and there are 5 perfect cubes, namely $1^{3}, \\ldots, 5^{3}$. Then notice there are two repetitions, $1^{6} =1^2 = 1^3 = 1$ and $2^{6} = 8^2 = 4^3 = 64$. So there is a total of $12+5-2=15$ integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Thus, we get $150-15=135$ integers from 1 to 150 that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes. So the probability that we select such a number is $\\frac{135}{150} = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that a number is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube, we first need to find the number of perfect squares and perfect cubes from 1 to 150.\n\nThe perfect squares are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, and 144. There are 12 perfect squares.\n\nThe perfect cubes are: 1, 8, 27, 64, and 125. There are 5 perfect cubes. However, we should note that 1 and 64 are both perfect squares and perfect cubes, so they should not be counted twice.\n\nThe total number of perfect squares or perfect cubes is 12 + 5 - 2 = 15.\n\nThe probability that a selected number is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube is 1 minus the probability that it is a perfect square or a perfect cube. There are 150 numbers in total. \n\nThe probability that it is a perfect square or a perfect cube is 15/150, which simplifies to 1/10.\n\nThe probability that it is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube is 1 - 1/10 = 9/10.\n\nSo, the probability that a selected number is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube is 9/10."
