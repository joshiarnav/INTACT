    "problem": "In how many different ways can four students stand in a straight line if two of the students refuse to stand next to each other?",
    "solution": "We will count the number of ways in which the two students do stand next to each other and then subtract that from the total number of ways all four students can stand in a line without the restriction. If the two students stand next to each other, then we can treat them as a block. There are three blocks: two one-student blocks and one two-student block. We can arrange the blocks in $3!=6$ ways, and there are 2 ways to arrange the students within the two-student block, for a total of $6\\cdot2=12$ ways. The total number of ways to arrange all four students in a line without restrictions is $4!=24$ ways. Thus, the number of ways with the restriction is $24-12=\\boxed{12}$ ways.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll first find the total number of ways four students can stand in a line without any restrictions. Then, we'll subtract the number of ways they can stand with the two students who refuse to stand next to each other being together.\n\nTotal number of ways four students can stand in a line: \nThere are 4 choices for the first position, 3 for the second, 2 for the third, and 1 for the fourth. So, the total number of ways is:\n4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n\nNow, let's consider the two students who refuse to stand next to each other as one unit. This means we now have 3 units in total: 2 students who can stand together and the 3rd student. These 3 units can stand in a line in 3! = 6 ways. \n\nHowever, the two students who are together can also switch places, so for each of the 6 ways, there are 2 ways for them to stand. Therefore, there are 6 * 2 = 12 ways for the two students who refuse to stand next to each other to be together.\n\nNow, we'll find the number of ways they can stand with these two students together: \nThere are 6 ways for the 3 units to stand, and for each of these ways, there are 2 ways for the two students to stand together. Therefore, there are 6 * 2 = 12 ways for the two students to be together.\n\nFinally, we'll subtract the number of ways they can stand with the two students together from the total number of ways: \n24 - 12 = 12\n\nSo, there are 12 different ways the four students can stand in a straight line if two of the students refuse to stand next to each other."
