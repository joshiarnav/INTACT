    "problem": "How many three digit numbers are left if we exclude all three digit numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent?",
    "solution": "The only three digit numbers which are ruled out are numbers of the form $ABA$, where A and B are different digits. There are 9 ways to choose A, since it can't be 0, and once A has been chosen there are 9 ways to choose B. Since there are $9\\cdot10\\cdot10=900$ total three digit numbers, and $9\\cdot9=81$ numbers which aren't valid, there are $900-81=\\boxed{819}$ valid numbers.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of three-digit numbers and then subtract the number of three-digit numbers with exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent.\n\nTotal number of three-digit numbers: \n- The first digit cannot be 0, so for the first digit, we have 9 choices (1-9).\n- For the second and third digits, we have 10 choices (0-9) each.\nSo, total three-digit numbers = 9 * 10 * 10 = 900.\n\nNow, let's find the number of three-digit numbers with exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent:\n- We can choose the non-adjacent digit in 9 ways (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n- For the other two digits, one is the same as the first digit and the other is the same as the second digit. The non-adjacent digit can be the first digit, so we have two ways to choose which digit is the same as the first digit and which is the same as the second digit.\n- The remaining digit can be any of the 9 digits (as it cannot be the same as the first two digits), so we have 9 choices for this digit.\nHowever we have 9 * 2 * 9 * (2 * 1) since the last digit has two options to be the same as the second digit or first digit which results in 162.\n\nNow, subtract the number of three-digit numbers with exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent, from the total number of three-digit numbers:\nTotal three-digit numbers - numbers with exactly two non-adjacent digits the same = 900 - 162 = 738. \n\nTherefore, 738 three-digit numbers are left if we exclude all three-digit numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent."
