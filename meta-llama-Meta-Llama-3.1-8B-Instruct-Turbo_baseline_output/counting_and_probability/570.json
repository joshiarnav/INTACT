    "problem": "If Greg rolls four fair six-sided dice, what is the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's?",
    "solution": "We notice that the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's must equal the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's. So, we can find the probability that Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's, subtract it from 1, and divide by 2 to find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's. There are three ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's: he can roll two of each, one of each, or none of each. If he rolls two of each, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which two dice roll the 1's. If he rolls one of each, there are $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1}=12$ ways to choose which dice are the 6 and the 1, and for each of those ways there are $4\\cdot4=16$ ways to choose the values of the other dice. If Greg rolls no 1's or 6's, there are $4^4=256$ possible values for the dice. In total, there are $6+12\\cdot16+256=454$ ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's. There are $6^4=1296$ total ways the four dice can roll, so the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\left(1-\\dfrac{454}{1296}\\right)=\\boxed{\\dfrac{421}{1296}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the probability of Greg rolling the same number of 1's and 6's, and the probability of Greg rolling more 1's than 6's when he rolls 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 1's and 6's.\n\nThe probability that Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's is when he rolls 0, 2, or 4 1's and 6's since he is rolling four dice.\n\nWhen rolling four dice, there are 6^4 = 1296 possible outcomes.\n\nThere are C(4, 0) * (5/6)^4 =  625/1296  ways to roll 0 1's and 6's, C(4, 2) * (5/6)^2 * (1/6)^2 = 900/1296  ways to roll 2 1's and 6's, and C(4, 4) * (5/6)^4 = 625/1296  ways to roll 4 1's and 6's.\n\nSo, the probability of Greg rolling the same number of 1's and 6's is 625/1296 + 900/1296 + 625/1296 = 2150/1296.\n\nTo find the probability of Greg rolling more 1's than 6's, we can subtract the probability of Greg rolling the same number of 1's and 6's from 1.\n\nThe probability of Greg rolling more 1's than 6's is 1 - 2150/1296 = 146/1296.\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.\n\nThe simplified probability of Greg rolling more 1's than 6's is 73/648."
