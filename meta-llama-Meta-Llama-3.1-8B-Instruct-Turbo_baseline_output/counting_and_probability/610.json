    "problem": "Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards (13 hearts, 13 clubs, 13 spades, and 13 diamonds).  What is the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen?",
    "solution": "The probability that the first card is a 6 is $\\dfrac{1}{13}$.  There are then 51 cards remaining, so the probability the second card is a Queen is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  The answer is then $\\dfrac{1}{13} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{663}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen, we need to consider two cases:\n\n1. The first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen.\n2. The first card is a 6, but the second card is not a Queen (we don't care about this case, just that the first card is a 6).\n\nHowever, the first case is what we want, and the second is just a distraction.  We want to pick a 6 first, and then a Queen, and we want to find the probability of those two events.\n\nThe probability of the first card being a 6 is 4/52 because there are 4 sixes in a deck of 52 cards.\n\nIf we draw a 6, we are now left with 51 cards from which we can draw the second card.  There are 4 Queens in the deck, so the probability of drawing a Queen second is 4/51.\n\nSo the probability of drawing a 6 first and a Queen second is (4/52) * (4/51).\n\nTo simplify this, multiply the numerators and the denominators:\n\n(4 * 4) / (52 * 51) = 16 / 2652\n\nDividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 4, gives the answer:\n\n4 / 663."
