    "problem": "A Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans. Assuming all politicians are distinguishable, in how many ways can they sit around a circular table without restrictions?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "There are 10 people to place, so we can place them in $10!$ ways, but this counts each valid arrangement 10 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement).  So the number of ways to seat them is $\\dfrac{10!}{10} = 9! = \\boxed{362,\\!880}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange 10 distinguishable people around a circular table without any restrictions. \n\nFirst, if we arrange them in a linear fashion, we have 10! ways to do this. However, because the table is circular, we need to divide by the number of rotations that result in the same seating. \n\nThere are 10 possible rotations for each seating (each person could be in any of the 10 seats), but we only want to count each unique seating once. Therefore, we divide the total number of linear arrangements by 10.\n\nSo, the number of unique circular arrangements is 10! / 10 = 9!.\n\nHowever, 9! equals 362880."
