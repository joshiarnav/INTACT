    "problem": "A math conference is presenting a lecture series with six different lecturers. If Dr. Smith's lecture depends on Dr. Jones's lecture, so that Dr. Smith must be scheduled at some time after Dr. Jones, in how many orders can the six lecturers be scheduled?",
    "solution": "There are a total of $6!$ ways to order the 6 lectures with no restriction. By symmetry, exactly half of these will have Dr. Jones's lecture before Dr. Smith's lecture. Thus there are $6!/2 = \\boxed{360}$ ways to schedule the conference.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of permutations with restrictions. \n\nFirst, let's consider the case where there are no restrictions. If we have 6 different lecturers, the number of ways to arrange them in order is 6! (6 factorial), which is equal to 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 720.\n\nHowever, we have a restriction that Dr. Smith's lecture must be scheduled after Dr. Jones's lecture. This means that for every valid schedule, we can \"undo\" the restriction by swapping Dr. Smith's and Dr. Jones's lectures, effectively reversing the order of the two lectures. \n\nIf we do this for all valid schedules, we will end up with the same set of schedules, but with the restriction undone. Therefore, for every valid schedule, we can \"undo\" the restriction by swapping Dr. Smith's and Dr. Jones's lectures, resulting in 1/2 of the original 720 valid schedules. \n\nHowever, doing this \"undoing\" once will still not account for all the cases. For example, Dr. Jones could be in the second or third position, and Dr. Smith could be in the third or fourth position. In order to account for this case, we can multiply this by the number of possible \"undoings\" that are possible. The number of possible \"undoings\" is equal to the number of possible positions Dr. Jones and Dr. Smith can be in. \n\nIn this case, Dr. Jones and Dr. Smith can be in the first and second positions, the first and third positions, the first and fourth positions, the first and fifth positions, or the first and sixth positions. This is equal to 5 possible \"undoings\".\n\nHowever, we need to account for the fact that there are actually 6 possible positions for Dr. Jones and Dr. Smith. As such, we can simply divide 6! by 2. The result of this calculation is (6!)/2 = 360."
