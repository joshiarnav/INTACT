    "problem": "A triangle with side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5 is inscribed in a circle of radius 3.  What is the area of the triangle? Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $3x$, $4x$, and $5x$.  The triangle is a right triangle, so its hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle.  Thus $5x=2\\cdot 3=6$, so $x=6/5$.  The area of the triangle is \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3x\\cdot 4x =\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{18}{5}\\cdot \\frac{24}{5}\n=\\frac{216}{25}=\\boxed{8.64}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "In a 3:4:5 triangle, the side lengths can be expressed as 3x, 4x, and 5x. The hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) of the triangle is 5x. Since this side is a diameter of the circle, we know that 5x = 2 * radius = 2 * 3 = 6. \n\nWe can now solve for x:\n5x = 6\nx = 6 / 5\n\nNow that we know the value of x, we can find the side lengths of the triangle:\n3x = 3 * 6 / 5 = 18 / 5\n4x = 4 * 6 / 5 = 24 / 5\n5x = 6 / 5 is not needed as we already know this is the length of one side\n\nUsing the formula for the area of a triangle (Area = (1/2) * base * height), we can find the area of the triangle. The base and height of the triangle can be taken as 3x and 4x, respectively:\nArea = (1/2) * (3x) * (4x)\nArea = (1/2) * (18/5) * (24/5)\nArea = (1/2) * (18 * 24) / 25\nArea = (1/2) * 432 / 25\nArea = 216 / 25\n\nNow we convert this into a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth:\nArea = 8.64\n\nThe area of the triangle is approximately 8.64."
