    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ has vertices with coordinates $A(2,3),$ $B(7,8),$ and $C(-4,6)$. The triangle is reflected about line $L$. The image points are $A'(2,-5),$ $B'(7,-10),$ and $C'(-4,-8)$. What is the equation of line $L$?",
    "solution": "Since only the $y$ portions of the coordinates move, we know that the line of reflection must be a horizontal line. Now we just need to find the midpoint between an original point and its reflected image to pinpoint the location of the line. The $y$-coordinate of point $A$ is 3 and the $y$-coordinate of $A'$ is $-5$; therefore, the midpoint is at $(2, -1)$. The line of refection is $\\boxed{y = -1}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the equation of line L, we need to determine its slope and a point it passes through.\n\nThe slope of line L can be found by examining the change in y-coordinates and x-coordinates of the original points and their reflections. The reflection of a point (x, y) across a line with slope m and y-intercept b is (x, 2b - y).\n\nLet's calculate the midpoint of the line segment joining each point to its image. The midpoint is equidistant from the original point and its image, so it lies on line L.\n\nMidpoint of AA': \n((2+2)/2, (3 + (-5))/2) = (2, -1)\n\nMidpoint of BB': \n((7+7)/2, (8 + (-10))/2) = (7, -1)\n\nMidpoint of CC': \n((-4 + (-4))/2, (6 + (-8))/2) = (-4, -1)\n\nSince all the midpoints have the same y-coordinate (-1), line L is a horizontal line. The equation of a horizontal line is given by y = b, where b is the y-coordinate of any point on the line.\n\nTherefore, the equation of line L is y = -1."
