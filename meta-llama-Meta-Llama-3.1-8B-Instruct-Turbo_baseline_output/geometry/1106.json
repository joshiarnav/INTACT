    "problem": "Square $ABCD$ has side length $1$ unit.  Points $E$ and $F$ are on sides $AB$ and $CB$, respectively, with $AE = CF$.  When the square is folded along the lines $DE$ and $DF$, sides $AD$ and $CD$ coincide and lie on diagonal $BD$.  The length of segment $AE$ can be expressed in the form $\\sqrt{k}-m$ units. What is the integer value of $k+m$?",
    "solution": "We start by drawing a diagram.  When the paper is folded, sides $AD$ and $CD$ coincide on the longer dashed line, and points $A$ and $C$ meet at $G$, as you can see below.  [asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(1,.4)); draw((0,0)--(.4,1));\ndraw((1,.4)--(.4,1),dashed);\ndraw((0,0)--(.7,.7),dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,1), NW); label(\"$B$\",(1,1), NE); label(\"$C$\",(1,0), SE); label(\"$D$\",(0,0), SW);\nlabel(\"$F$\",(1,.4), E); label(\"$E$\",(.4,1), N);\nlabel(\"$G$\",(.7,.7), NE);\n[/asy] Now, we assign variables.  We are looking for the length of $AE$, so let $AE=x$.  Then, $BE=1-x$.  Because of the symmetry of the square and the fold, everything to the left of line $BD$ is a mirror image of everything to the right of $BD$.  Thus, $\\triangle BEF$ is an isosceles right triangle (45-45-90), so $EF=\\sqrt{2}EB = \\sqrt{2}(1-x)$.  Also, $\\triangle EGB$ and $\\triangle FGB$ are congruent 45-45-90 triangles, so $GB = \\frac{EB}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nAlso, notice that because the way the paper is folded (its original position versus its final position), we have more congruent triangles, $\\triangle AED \\cong \\triangle GED$.  This means that $AD=GD=1$.\n\nLastly, notice that since $G$ is on $BD$, we have $BD=BG+GD$. $BD$ is a diagonal of the square, so it has side length $\\sqrt{2}$, $GD=1$, and $GB = \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}$.  Thus, our equation becomes \\[\\sqrt{2} = 1 + \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}.\\] Multiplying both sides by $\\sqrt{2}$ yields $2=\\sqrt{2}+1-x$; solving for $x$ yields $x=\\sqrt{2}-1$.  Thus, $AE=\\sqrt{2}-1=\\sqrt{k}-m$, and we see that $k+m=2+1=\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to use geometry and trigonometry. \n\nFirst, let's consider the 45-45-90 triangle $ADE$. Let $x = AE$ and $y = ED$. Since $AD = 1$, we have $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.\n\nNow, if we consider the triangle $CDE$, we know that $AD = CD = 1$, so $x + y = 1$ since they both are part of the diagonal BD after folding the square.\n\nWe can solve the system of equations as follows:\n\nWe can solve for $y = 1 - x$ and then substitute into the first equation $x^2 + (1-x)^2 = 1$.\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n$x^2 + 1 - 2x + x^2 = 1$\n\nCombine like terms: \n$2x^2 - 2x = 0$\n\nSolving for x we get:\n$x(2x - 2) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two solutions: $x = 0$ or $x = 1$.\nHowever, since $AE$ is part of the triangle $ABE$, $x$ must be less than 1, so we take $x = 1 - \\sqrt{2}/2$.\n\nNow if we solve for $1 - x = y$ we can find $y = \\sqrt{2}/2 - 1$.\n\nHowever, we know that triangles $BDE$ and $DFC$ are congruent by SSS, so $CF = y = DF$.\n\nSince $BD$ is the hypotenuse of right triangle $BDC$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $BD$. $BD^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2$. Since $BD$ is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length $1 + x$, we can solve for $1 + x = BD$.\n\nHowever, we know from the problem statement that the length of segment $AE$ can be expressed in the form $\\sqrt{k}-m$, and since we found that $x = 1 - \\sqrt{2}/2$, then k = 2 and m = 1, as $ 1 - \\sqrt{2}/2$ can be rewritten as $\\sqrt{2} - 1$.\n\nThus, $k+m = 2+1 = 3$"
