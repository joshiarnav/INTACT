    "problem": "A hemisphere-shaped bowl with radius 1 foot is filled full with chocolate.  All of the chocolate is then evenly distributed between 27 congruent, smaller hemisphere-shaped molds.  What is the radius of each of the smaller molds, in feet?",
    "solution": "A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so a hemisphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$.  The large hemisphere-shaped bowl has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi(1^3) = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ cubic feet.\n\nLet each of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds have radius $r$.  Their total volume, in terms of $r$, is $27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$ cubic feet, so we have \\[27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi.\\]Dividing both sides by $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ yields $27r^3 =1$, so $r=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$ feet.",

    "model_solution": "The volume of a hemisphere-shaped bowl (or mold) with radius r can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (2/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n\nThe volume of the chocolate is also equal to the volume of the hemisphere-shaped bowl.  Let's call the radius of the smaller molds \"r\".  The total volume of the smaller molds can be calculated as:\n\n27 * (2/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n\nThis is equal to the volume of the larger bowl, which is:\n\n(2/3)\u03c0(1)\u00b3\n\nSo we can set up an equation:\n\n27 * (2/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = (2/3)\u03c0(1)\u00b3\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n27r\u00b3 = 1\u00b3\n\nDividing both sides by 27, we get:\n\nr\u00b3 = 1/27\n\nTaking the cube root of both sides, we get:\n\nr = \u221b(1/27)\nr = 1/3"
