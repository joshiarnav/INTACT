    "problem": "What is the volume in cubic inches of a right, rectangular prism with side, front and bottom faces having an area 15 square inches, 10 square inches and 6 square inches, respectively?",
    "solution": "Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.",

    "model_solution": "To find the volume of a right rectangular prism, we need to know the length, width, and height. \n\nLet's denote the length, width, and height as l, w, and h, respectively. \n\nWe're given that the side, front, and bottom faces have areas of 15 square inches, 10 square inches, and 6 square inches, respectively. \n\nSo, we can write the following equations:\nlw = 15 \nlh = 10 \nwh = 6 \n\nMultiplying these three equations together, we get: \n(lw)(lh)(wh) = 15(10)(6)  \nl^2w^2h^2 = 900  \n\nTo find the volume, we need to find the product of l, w, and h. We can do this by taking the square root of l^2w^2h^2. \n\nSo, the volume V = sqrt(l^2w^2h^2) = sqrt(900) = 30."
