    "problem": "In triangle $ABC$, we have that $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of sides $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{AB}$, respectively. The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is 24 square units. How many square units are in the area of $\\triangle CEF$?",
    "solution": "We first draw a diagram: [asy]\npair A, B, C, E, F;\nA = (0, 4);\nB = (-3, 0);\nC = (7, 0);\nE = 0.5 * A + 0.5 * C;\nF = 0.5 * A + 0.5 * B;\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--E--F--cycle);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\n[/asy] Since $F$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, the area of $\\triangle AFC$ is half of the area of $\\triangle ABC,$ or 12 square units. Following the same reasoning, we see that $E$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AC},$ so the area of $\\triangle CEF$ is half that of $\\triangle AFC,$ or $\\boxed{6}$ square units.",

    "model_solution": "Since E and F are midpoints of sides AC and AB, triangle CEF is similar to triangle ABC. The ratio of the area of triangle CEF to the area of triangle ABC is the square of the ratio of the lengths of their sides. \n\nLet the length of the sides of triangle ABC be x. Then the length of the sides of triangle CEF is x/2. \n\nThe ratio of the areas of triangle CEF to triangle ABC is (x/2)^2/x^2 = 1/4.\n\nSo, the area of triangle CEF is 24 * 1/4 = 6 square units."
