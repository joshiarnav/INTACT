    "problem": "Let $ABCD$ and $BCFG$ be two faces of a cube with $AB=12$. A beam of light emanates from vertex $A$ and reflects off face $BCFG$ at point $P$, which is 7 units from $\\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\\overline{BC}$. The beam continues to be reflected off the faces of the cube. The length of the light path from the time it leaves point $A$ until it next reaches a vertex of the cube is given by $m\\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n$.\n",
    "solution": "When a light beam reflects off a surface, the path is like that of a ball bouncing. Picture that, and also imagine X, Y, and Z coordinates for the cube vertices. The coordinates will all involve 0's and 12's only, so that means that the X, Y, and Z distance traveled by the light must all be divisible by 12. Since the light's Y changes by 5 and the X changes by 7 (the Z changes by 12, don't worry about that), and 5 and 7 are relatively prime to 12, the light must make 12 reflections onto the XY plane or the face parallel to the XY plane.\nIn each reflection, the distance traveled by the light is $\\sqrt{ (12^2) + (5^2) + (7^2) }$ = $\\sqrt{218}$. This happens 12 times, so the total distance is $12\\sqrt{218}$. $m=12$ and $n=218$, so therefore, the answer is $m+n=\\boxed{230}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we first need to visualize the cube and the path of the light beam. We can then use the properties of the cube and the reflection of the light beam to find the length of the path.\n\nSince the light beam starts at vertex $A$ and reflects off face $BCFG$, we can create a 3D coordinate system with $A$ at the origin and $B$ on the $x$-axis. We can then place $P$ at the point $(5,7,0)$, since it is 7 units from $\\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\\overline{BC}$.\n\nThe light beam then reflects off the other faces of the cube, creating a path that can be described as a series of reflections and rotations. We can analyze the path of the light beam in 3D space and use the distance formula to find the length of the path.\n\nThe light beam travels from $A$ to $P$, then reflects off face $ADFE$, then reflects off face $BCFG$ at point $Q$, and finally reaches vertex $C$. We can use the distance formula to find the length of the path from $A$ to $P$, from $P$ to $Q$, and from $Q$ to $C$.\n\nThe distance from $A$ to $P$ is $\\sqrt{5^2+7^2+0^2} = 8\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe distance from $P$ to $Q$ is $\\sqrt{5^2+0^2+12^2} = 13$.\n\nThe distance from $Q$ to $C$ is $\\sqrt{0^2+12^2+0^2} = 12$.\n\nThe total length of the path is $8\\sqrt{2}+13+12=33+8\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nHowever, we are asked to find the length of the path in the form $m\\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. We can rewrite the total length of the path as $8\\sqrt{2}+33$.\n\nWe can then combine the terms and simplify the expression to get $8\\sqrt{2}+33$. The coefficient of the square root term is 8, and the number under the square root is 2.\n\nTherefore, $m=8$ and $n=2$. The sum of $m$ and $n$ is $8+2=10$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{58}$"
