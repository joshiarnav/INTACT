    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with $AC = 7,$ $BC = 24,$ and right angle at $C.$ Point $M$ is the midpoint of $AB,$ and $D$ is on the same side of line $AB$ as $C$ so that $AD = BD = 15.$ Given that the area of triangle $CDM$ may be expressed as $\\frac {m\\sqrt {n}}{p},$ where $m,$ $n,$ and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, find $m + n + p.$\n",

    "model_solution": "To begin, let's apply the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle $ABC$ since it is a right triangle. From $AC = 7$ and $BC = 24$, we can find the length of $AB$:\n\n\\[\nAB^2 = BC^2 + AC^2\n\\]\n\\[\nAB^2 = 24^2 + 7^2\n\\]\n\\[\nAB^2 = 576 + 49\n\\]\n\\[\nAB^2 = 625\n\\]\n\\[\nAB = 25\n\\]\n\nSince $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, we can use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of $M$. However, in this problem, we can directly proceed with solving for the height of triangle $CDM$ using the information provided and the concept of similar triangles.\n\nLet's use the concept of similar triangles to find the height of triangle $CDM$. We can create a line from point $C$ perpendicular to $AB$ and denote the intersection of this line with $AB$ as point $E$. This line divides triangle $ABC$ into two smaller right triangles $ACE$ and $BCE$. Also, this line divides triangle $CDM$ into two smaller right triangles $CEM$ and $DME$.\n\nSince $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, the length of $AE$ will be equal to the length of $BE$, which is half the length of $AB$. \n\n\\[\nAE = BE = \\frac{AB}{2} = \\frac{25}{2}\n\\]\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the height of triangle $CDM$, or rather the height of right triangle $CEM$ or $DME$. Let's consider triangle $DME$. Since $DE = 15 - \\frac{25}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}$, we can apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the height of triangle $CDM$.\n\nHowever, the key to solving this problem is to use the concept of similar triangles. Since $AC = 7$ and $BC = 24$, we can use the ratio of these two side lengths to find the height of triangle $CDM$.\n\nFirst, we need to find the height of triangle $ABC$. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle $ABC$, we can find the height of the triangle:\n\n\\[\nAC^2 = BC^2 - CE^2\n\\]\n\\[\n7^2 = 24^2 - CE^2\n\\]\n\\[\n49 = 576 - CE^2\n\\]\n\\[\nCE^2 = 576 - 49\n\\]\n\\[\nCE^2 = 527\n\\]\n\\[\nCE = \\sqrt{527}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can use the ratio of $AC$ and $AB$ to find the ratio of the height of triangle $ABC$ to the height of triangle $CDM$. The height of triangle $CDM$ can be represented as $x$. Therefore, the ratio of the height of triangle $ABC$ to the height of triangle $CDM$ is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{AC}{AB} = \\frac{\\sqrt{527}}{x}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{25} = \\frac{\\sqrt{527}}{x}\n\\]\n\nWe can solve this equation for $x$ by cross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n7x = 25\\sqrt{527}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{25\\sqrt{527}}{7}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle $CDM$ can be found using the formula $\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height. In this case, the base of triangle $CDM$ is $15$, and the height of triangle $CDM$ is $\\frac{25\\sqrt{527}}{7}$. Applying the formula, we can find the area of triangle $CDM$:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of triangle} \\ CDM = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot15\\cdot\\frac{25\\sqrt{527}}{7}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Area of triangle} \\ CDM = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{15\\cdot25\\cdot\\sqrt{527}}{7}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Area of triangle} \\ CDM = \\frac{15\\cdot25\\cdot\\sqrt{527}}{14}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Area of triangle} \\ CDM = \\frac{375\\sqrt{527}}{14}\n\\]\n\nConverting the area expression into the desired form, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of triangle} \\ CDM = \\frac{m\\sqrt{n}}{p}\n\\]\n\\[\nm = 375\n\\]\n\\[\nn = 527\n\\]\n\\[\np = 14\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of $m$, $n$, and $p$ is:\n\n\\[\nm + n + p = 375 + 527 + 14\n\\]\n\\[\nm + n + p = 916\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is 916."
