    "solution": "Rewrite the given equations as $(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 256$ and $(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 16$.\nLet $w_3$ have center $(x,y)$ and radius $r$. Now, if two circles with radii $r_1$ and $r_2$ are externally tangent, then the distance between their centers is $r_1 + r_2$, and if they are internally tangent, it is $|r_1 - r_2|$. So we have\n\\begin{align*} r + 4 &= \\sqrt{(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\\\ 16 - r &= \\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\end{align*}\nSolving for $r$ in both equations and setting them equal, then simplifying, yields\n\\begin{align*} 20 - \\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2} &= \\sqrt{(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\\\ 20+x &= 2\\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\end{align*}\nSquaring again and canceling yields $1 = \\frac{x^2}{100} + \\frac{(y-12)^2}{75}.$\nSo the locus of points that can be the center of the circle with the desired properties is an ellipse.\n[asy] size(220); pointpen = black; pen d = linewidth(0.7); pathpen = d;  pair A = (-5, 12), B = (5, 12), C = (0, 0); D(CR(A,16));D(CR(B,4));D(shift((0,12)) * yscale(3^.5 / 2) * CR(C,10), linetype(\"2 2\") + d + red); D((0,30)--(0,-10),Arrows(4));D((15,0)--(-25,0),Arrows(4));D((0,0)--MP(\"y=ax\",(14,14 * (69/100)^.5),E),EndArrow(4));  void bluecirc (real x) {  pair P = (x, (3 * (25 - x^2 / 4))^.5 + 12); dot(P, blue);  D(CR(P, ((P.x - 5)^2 + (P.y - 12)^2)^.5 - 4) , blue + d + linetype(\"4 4\")); }  bluecirc(-9.2); bluecirc(-4); bluecirc(3); [/asy]\nSince the center lies on the line $y = ax$, we substitute for $y$ and expand:\\[1 = \\frac{x^2}{100} + \\frac{(ax-12)^2}{75} \\Longrightarrow (3+4a^2)x^2 - 96ax + 276 = 0.\\]\nWe want the value of $a$ that makes the line $y=ax$ tangent to the ellipse, which will mean that for that choice of $a$ there is only one solution to the most recent equation. But a quadratic has one solution iff its discriminant is $0$, so $(-96a)^2 - 4(3+4a^2)(276) = 0$.\nSolving yields $a^2 = \\frac{69}{100}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{169}$.",

    "model_solution": "To start off, rewrite the given equations of the circles in standard form: \n\n\\[\n(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 256\n\\]\nand \n\\[\n(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 16\n\\]\n\nFrom these equations, we can tell that the centers of the two circles $w_1$ and $w_2$ are $(-5, 12)$ and $(5, 12)$, respectively.\n\nGiven that the center of the desired circle is $(x, ax)$, we need to find the smallest positive value of $a$ for which the desired circle is externally tangent to $w_2$ and internally tangent to $w_1$. This means that the distance between $(x, ax)$ and $(5, 12)$ is the sum of the radii of the desired circle and $w_2$, and the distance between $(x, ax)$ and $(-5, 12)$ is the difference of the radii of the desired circle and $w_1$.\n\nUsing the distance formula, we get the following equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(x-5)^2+(ax-12)^2} &= r+4 \\\\\n\\sqrt{(x+5)^2+(ax-12)^2} &= |r-16|\n\\end{align*}\n\nSquaring both sides of each equation, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(x-5)^2+(ax-12)^2 &= (r+4)^2 \\\\\n(x+5)^2+(ax-12)^2 &= (r-16)^2\n\\end{align*}\n\nExpanding the left-hand sides of the two equations, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2-10x+25+a^2x^2-24ax+144 &= r^2+8r+16 \\\\\nx^2+10x+25+a^2x^2-24ax+144 &= r^2-32r+256\n\\end{align*}\n\nMoving the terms involving $x$ to one side and the constants to the other side of each equation, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(a^2+1)x^2-(24a+10)x+169-8r+16 &= 0 \\\\\n(a^2+1)x^2-(24a-10)x+169+32r-256 &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince the desired circle is externally tangent to $w_2$ and internally tangent to $w_1$, the two equations must have a common solution $(x, ax)$. Therefore, the two equations must be equal to each other. Setting the right-hand sides of the two equations equal to each other, we get\n\n$$169-8r+16=169+32r-256$$\n\nSolving for $r$, we get $r=9$.\n\nSubstituting $r=9$ into the first equation, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(a^2+1)x^2-(24a+10)x+169-8\\cdot 9+16 &= 0 \\\\\n(a^2+1)x^2-(24a+10)x+169-72+16 &= 0 \\\\\n(a^2+1)x^2-(24a+10)x+113 &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nSubstituting $r=9$ into the second equation, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(a^2+1)x^2-(24a-10)x+169+32\\cdot 9-256 &= 0 \\\\\n(a^2+1)x^2-(24a-10)x+169+288-256 &= 0 \\\\\n(a^2+1)x^2-(24a-10)x+201 &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince the two equations must have a common solution $(x, ax)$, the two equations must be equal to each other. Setting the left-hand sides of the two equations equal to each other, we get\n\n$$(a^2+1)x^2-(24a+10)x+113 = (a^2+1)x^2-(24a-10)x+201$$\n\nSubtracting the two sides of the equation, we get\n\n$$-24a-10+24a-10=201-113$$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get\n\n$$-20=88$$\n\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, the two equations do not have a common solution $(x, ax)$.\n\nHowever, we know that the desired circle is externally tangent to $w_2$ and internally tangent to $w_1$. This means that the distance between $(x, ax)$ and $(5, 12)$ is the sum of the radii of the desired circle and $w_2$, and the distance between $(x, ax)$ and $(-5, 12)$ is the difference of the radii of the desired circle and $w_1$.\n\nUsing the distance formula, we get the following equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(x-5)^2+(ax-12)^2} &= r+4 \\\\\n\\sqrt{(x+5)^2+(ax-12)^2} &= |r-16|\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can rewrite these equations as\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(x-5)^2+(ax-12)^2 &= (r+4)^2 \\\\\n(x+5)^2+(ax-12)^2 &= (r-16)^2\n\\end{align*}\n\nSubtracting the two equations, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2-10x+25+a^2x^2-24ax+144 -(x^2+10x+25+a^2x^2-24ax+144) &= (r+4)^2-(r-16)^2 \\\\\n-20x &= 20r \\\\\nx &= -r\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, $x=-r$. Substituting $x=-r$ into the first equation, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(-r-5)^2+(a(-r)-12)^2 &= (r+4)^2 \\\\\n(r+5)^2+(ar-12)^2 &= r^2+8r+16\n\\end{align*}\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\nr^2+10r+25+ar^2-24r+144 &= r^2+8r+16 \\\\\nr^2+10r+25+ar^2-24r+144-r^2-8r-16 &= 0 \\\\\nr^2+2r+109+ar^2-16r+128 &= 0 \\\\\n(1+a)r^2-14r+237 &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince the desired circle is externally tangent to $w_2$ and internally tangent to $w_1$, we know that $r=9$.\n\nSubstituting $r=9$ into the equation, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(1+a)(9)^2-14\\cdot 9+237 &= 0 \\\\\n81+81a-126+237 &= 0 \\\\\n81a+192 &= 0 \\\\\n81a &= -192 \\\\\na &= \\frac{-192}{81} \\\\\na &= -\\frac{64}{27}\n\\end{align*}\n\nHowever, we are asked to find the smallest positive value of $a$ for which the desired circle is externally tangent to $w_2$ and internally tangent to $w_1$. Since $a=-\\frac{64}{27}$ is negative, we need to find the smallest positive value of $a$ for which the desired circle is externally tangent to $w_2$ and internally tangent to $w_1$.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation $(1+a)r^2-14r+237=0$ as\n\n$$(1+a)r^2-14r+237=0 \\Leftrightarrow (1+a)r^2-14r+16=0$$\n\nSolving for $r$, we get\n\n$$r = \\frac{14 \\pm \\sqrt{196-4(1+a)(16)}}{2(1+a)}$$\n\nSimplifying the expression under the square root, we get\n\n$$r = \\frac{14 \\pm \\sqrt{-4-64a}}{2(1+a)}$$\n\nSince $r$ is a real number, we need\n\n$$-4-64a \\ge 0 \\Leftrightarrow -64a \\ge -4 \\Leftrightarrow a \\le \\frac{1}{16}$$\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive value of $a$ for which the desired circle is externally tangent to $w_2$ and internally tangent to $w_1$ is $a=\\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get\n\n$$m^2 = \\frac{1}{256}$$\n\nTherefore, $p=1$ and $q=256$, so the answer is $p+q=\\boxed{257}$."
