    "solution": "The line passing through the tangency point of the bottom left circle and the one to its right and through the tangency of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it is the line we are looking for: a line passing through the tangency of two circles cuts congruent areas, so our line cuts through the four aforementioned circles splitting into congruent areas, and there are an additional two circles on each side. The line passes through $\\left(1,\\frac 12\\right)$ and $\\left(\\frac 32,2\\right)$, which can be easily solved to be $6x = 2y + 5$. Thus, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = \\boxed{65}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the equation of the line that divides the union of the eight circular regions into two regions of equal area.\n\nThe line passes through the tangency point of the bottom left circle and the one to its right and also through the tangency of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it. This means that the line also passes through the tangency of the bottom left circle and the one to its right and the tangency of the top circle in the middle column and the one beneath it.\n\nThe bottom left circle and the one to its right have centers at (1, 0) and (3, 0). The tangency point of these two circles is at (2, 1/2). Similarly, the tangency point of the top circle in the middle column (with center at (2, 2)) and the one beneath it (with center at (2, 4)) is at (2, 5/2).\n\nUsing the two points (2, 1/2) and (2, 5/2), we can find the equation of the line. The slope of the line is given as 3, so the equation of the line can be written as:\n\ny - 1/2 = 3(x - 2)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n2y - 1 = 6x - 12\n\nRearranging the equation to the desired form ax = by + c:\n\n6x = 2y + 11\n\nTherefore, the values of a, b, and c are 6, 2, and 11, respectively.\n\nFinally, we can find the value of a^2 + b^2 + c^2:\n\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 6^2 + 2^2 + 11^2\n= 36 + 4 + 121\n= 161"
