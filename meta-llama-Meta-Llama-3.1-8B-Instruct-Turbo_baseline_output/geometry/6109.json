    "problem": "A right circular cone has base radius $r$ and height $h$. The cone lies on its side on a flat table. As the cone rolls on the surface of the table without slipping, the point where the cone's base meets the table traces a circular arc centered at the point where the vertex touches the table. The cone first returns to its original position on the table after making $17$ complete rotations. The value of $h/r$ can be written in the form $m\\sqrt {n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n$.\n",
    "solution": "The path is a circle with radius equal to the slant height of the cone, which is $\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}}$. Thus, the length of the path is $2\\pi\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}}$.\nAlso, the length of the path is 17 times the circumference of the base, which is $34r\\pi$. Setting these equal gives $\\sqrt {r^{2} + h^{2}} = 17r$, or $h^{2} = 288r^{2}$. Thus, $\\dfrac{h^{2}}{r^{2}} = 288$, and $\\dfrac{h}{r} = 12\\sqrt {2}$, giving an answer of $12 + 2 = \\boxed{14}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the path traced by the point where the cone's base meets the table. \n\nWhen the cone rolls without slipping, the distance traveled by the point on the cone's base is equal to the circumference of the circle traced by that point. This distance is also equal to the circumference of the cone's base multiplied by the number of rotations made by the cone.\n\nLet's denote the radius of the cone's base as $r$ and the height of the cone as $h$. The distance traveled by the point on the cone's base is $17 \\cdot 2\\pi r$, where $17$ is the number of rotations made by the cone.\n\nThe circumference of the circle traced by the point on the cone's base is $2\\pi R$, where $R$ is the distance from the point where the cone's vertex touches the table to the center of the circle traced by the point on the cone's base.\n\nSince the cone rolls without slipping, we can relate the distance traveled by the point on the cone's base to the distance traveled by the cone's vertex. The distance traveled by the cone's vertex is equal to the circumference of the circle traced by the cone's vertex, which is $2\\pi r$.\n\nWe can set up an equation to relate the distance traveled by the point on the cone's base to the distance traveled by the cone's vertex:\n\n$17 \\cdot 2\\pi r = 2\\pi R$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$R = 17r$\n\nNow, let's consider the right triangle formed by the cone's height, the cone's radius, and the slant height of the cone. The slant height of the cone is the distance from the point where the cone's vertex touches the table to the center of the cone's base.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can relate the height of the cone, the radius of the cone, and the slant height of the cone:\n\n$h^2 + r^2 = R^2$\n\nSubstituting $R = 17r$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$h^2 + r^2 = (17r)^2$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$h^2 + r^2 = 289r^2$\n\nSubtracting $r^2$ from both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n$h^2 = 288r^2$\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by $r^2$, we get:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{h}{r}\\right)^2 = 288$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{h}{r} = 12\\sqrt{2}$\n\nTherefore, the value of $h/r$ is $12\\sqrt{2}$. The sum of the integers is $12 + 2 = 14$."
