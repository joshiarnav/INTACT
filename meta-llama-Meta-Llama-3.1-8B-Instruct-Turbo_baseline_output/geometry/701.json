    "solution": "$\\triangle ABC$ is a right isosceles ($45^\\circ - 45^\\circ - 90^\\circ$) triangle, so $AC=AB\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2}$.  Thus, the side length of the octagon is $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWe can compute the octagon's area by subtracting the area of the four right isosceles triangles from the area of square $BDEF$.\n\nThe four right isosceles triangles are congruent by symmetry and each has an area of $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 1 \\cdot 1$, so their total area is \\[4\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 2.\\]  Each side of square $BDEF$ is comprised of a leg of a right isosceles triangle, a side of the octagon, and another leg of a different right isosceles triangle.  Hence, the side length of $BDEF$ is $1+\\sqrt{2}+1=2+\\sqrt{2}$, and the area of $BDEF$ is \\[(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4+2+4\\sqrt{2}.\\] Finally, the area of the octagon is \\[4+2+4\\sqrt{2} - 2 = \\boxed{4+4\\sqrt{2}}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the regular octagon, we can use the information given about the square $BDEF$ and the lengths of $AB$ and $BC$. \n\nSince $AB = BC = 1$, triangle $ABC$ is an isosceles right triangle. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the hypotenuse $AC$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nAC^2 & = AB^2 + BC^2 \\\\\n& = 1^2 + 1^2 \\\\\n& = 2\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo, $AC = \\sqrt{2}.$ Now, let's consider triangle $ACD$, which is also an isosceles right triangle since $AC = CD = \\sqrt{2}.$\n\nSince the area of a square is equal to the square of the length of its side, we can find the area of the square $BDEF$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n[BDEF]^2 & = (AC)^2 + (CD)^2 \\\\\n& = (\\sqrt{2})^2 + (\\sqrt{2})^2 \\\\\n& = 2 + 2 \\\\\n& = 4\n\\end{align*}\n\nHowever, we need to find the area of the entire square that the octagon is inscribed within, not just the area of $BDEF$.  To find this area, we need to find the side length of this square, denoted $s.$ We know that $\\overline{DF}$ is a side length of the square and that it is equal to $\\sqrt{2} + 1 + 1$, which is the sum of the lengths of $\\overline{AC}$, $\\overline{BC}$ (or $\\overline{AB}$) and $\\overline{AD}$ (or the length of side $\\overline{BC}$ of the isosceles right triangle $ABC$). \n\nHowever, by using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find that $AD$ equals $\\sqrt{2}$. \n\nWe now know that $s = \\sqrt{2} + 2$. We can now find the area of the square that the octagon is inscribed within by squaring $s$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ns^2 & = (\\sqrt{2} + 2)^2 \\\\\n& = 2 + 4\\sqrt{2} + 4 \\\\\n& = 6 + 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe now need to find the area of the square that is not part of the octagon, which is the four isosceles right triangles that are formed by the intersection of the square and the octagon. The area of one of these triangles is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since there are 4 of these triangles, the total area of the four triangles is $4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 2.$\n\nWe can now find the area of the octagon by finding the difference between the area of the square and the area of the four triangles:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Area of Octagon} & = \\text{Area of Square} - \\text{Area of Triangles} \\\\\n& = s^2 - 2 \\\\\n& = (6 + 4\\sqrt{2}) - 2 \\\\\n& = 4 + 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo, the area of the regular octagon is $\\boxed{4 + 4\\sqrt{2}}$ square units."
