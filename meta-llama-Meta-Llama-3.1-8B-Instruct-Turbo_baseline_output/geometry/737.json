    "problem": "The surface area of a particular sphere is $324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "solution": "Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2.\\]  Solving for $r$ and keeping the positive value yields $r^2=81$, so $r = 9$.  Hence the volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=81\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\pi = \\boxed{972\\pi}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula $4\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere. We are given that the surface area is $324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$, so we can set up the equation:\n\n$$4\\pi r^2 = 324\\pi$$\n\nDivide both sides by $4\\pi$:\n\n$$r^2 = \\frac{324\\pi}{4\\pi}$$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$$r^2 = 81$$\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\n$$r = \\sqrt{81}$$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$$r = 9\\text{ cm}$$\n\nNow that we know the radius of the sphere, we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$:\n\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$$\n\nSubstitute $r = 9\\text{ cm}$:\n\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (9)^3$$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\cdot 729$$\n\nMultiply:\n\n$$V = 972\\pi\\text{ cm}^3$$"
