    "solution": "Since $MC = 8$ and $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$, we have $MB=MC = 8$, so $BC=8+8=16$.  Since $B$ and $C$ trisect $\\overline{AD}$, we have $AB = CD = BC = 16$, so $AD =16+16+16=\\boxed{48}$.",

    "model_solution": "Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, the length of $\\overline{AM}$ is equal to the length of $\\overline{MD}$ and is half the length of $\\overline{AD}$. \n\nLet's denote the length of $\\overline{AD}$ as $x$. Since $\\overline{B}$ and $\\overline{C}$ trisect $\\overline{AD}$, the length of each trisected segment is $x/3$.\n\nAlso, given that $MC = 8$. Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, we can say that $MB = MD/2 = (x/3)/2 = x/6$ and $MD = MC + MC = 8 + 8 = 16$. However, $MD = x/2$ because $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$. Therefore, $x/2 = 16$ and $x = 32$."
