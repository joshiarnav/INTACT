    "problem": "In trapezoid $ABCD$, the parallel sides $AB$ and $CD$ have lengths of 8 and 20 units, respectively, and the altitude is 12 units. Points $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of sides $AD$ and $BC$, respectively. What is the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ in square units?",
    "solution": "Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, quadrilateral $EFCD$ is a trapezoid with half the altitude of the original trapezoid (the altitude of trapezoid $EFCD$ is $12/2 = 6$). The length of base $CD$ is still $20$, but now we have to find the length of base $EF$. Since $EF$ connects the midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, its length is also the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$. Thus, $EF$ has length $\\frac{8+20}{2} = 14$. Finally, we can find the area of the trapezoid with the formula $\\text{Area} = a \\left(\\frac{b_1+b_2}{2}\\right)$ where $a$ is the altitude and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases. The area of trapezoid $EFCD $ is $6 \\left(\\frac{14+20}{2}\\right)=6 \\cdot 17 = \\boxed{102}$ square units.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$, we first need to find the length of $EF$. Since $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of $AD$ and $BC$, respectively, then we can find the midpoint of $AB$ and $CD$ which would give us $EF$. As $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of $AB$ and $CD$, we find $EF = (AB + CD)/2 = (8+20)/2$, which gives $EF = 14$. \n\nHowever, we must find the actual length of $EF$ because the statement given is not entirely correct. To find the length of $EF$, we need to first find the length of $AE$ and $FB$. Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of $AD$ and $BC$, then $AE$ is half the length of $AD$ and $FB$ is half the length of $BC$. \n\nFirst, we must notice that $EF$ is the diagonal of the rectangle $AEBF$ formed by the midpoints of the trapezoid, which we must also find the area of. As the formula for the area of a rectangle is $l \\times w = lw$, we can use this to find the length of $EF$ by using the formula for the area of the rectangle $AEBF$ with $AD = 8 + 20 = 28$ because it is the vertical line that intersects the line $AB$ perpendicularly, and this line must be the height of the rectangle $AEBF$. The height of $AB$ is $12$ units. Therefore, we get $28$, which is vertical line, and $AB = 8 + 20 = 28$. The length of $EF$, which is the line we are currently looking for, becomes the length of the line that we must divide the area of the rectangle $AEBF$ by. To find the length of $EF$, we must find the area of the rectangle $AEBF$ first, and then we must use this to find the length of $EF$. \n\nThe length of $AB$ is 12 units. The length of $AD$ is 28 units. Therefore, the area of the rectangle $AEBF$ becomes $l \\times w = lw$, which is $AB \\times AD$, and this is equal to $12 \\times 28$. This is $336$ square units. \n\nNow, we must use the length we found (12) to find the length of $EF$. We must first find the area of the rectangle $AEBF$, which we know is $336$. \n\nSince the area of the rectangle $AEBF$ is $336$, then we can replace this in the formula $l \\times w = lw$ to find the length of $EF$. We know that the length is $12$ units. Therefore, we get $lw$, which is $12 \\times w = 336$, and we get $w$, which is $336 \\div 12 = 28$. \n\nHowever, we must replace this in the correct formula, which is $lw = 28 \\times l = 336$, but we replace this to find $l$, which is $l = 336 \\div 28 = 12$. \n\nNow, we must find the length of $EF$. We must use the area of the rectangle $AEBF$ to do this, which we know is $336$ square units. We must use the length we found (12) to find the length of $EF$. The length of $AB$ is 12 units. The length of $AD$ is 28 units. Therefore, the area of the rectangle $AEBF$ becomes $l \\times w = lw$, which is $AB \\times EF$. This is equal to $12 \\times EF$. This is $12 \\times EF = 336$. Therefore, we get $EF = 336 \\div 12$, which gives $EF = 28$. \n\nSince $EF = 28$, and we have a trapezoid $ABCD$ with a parallel side $AB$ of length 8 units and a parallel side $CD$ of length 20 units, we can find the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ using the formula for the area of a trapezoid, which is $\\frac{1}{2}h(b_1+b_2)$, where $h$ is the height of the trapezoid, and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the parallel sides. \n\nIn our trapezoid $ABCD$, we know that the height is 12 units, the parallel side $AB$ is 8 units, and the parallel side $CD$ is 20 units. Therefore, we can use these to find the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$. We get $\\frac{1}{2}h(b_1+b_2)$, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 \\times (8+20)$, which gives us $12 \\times 28 / 2$, which is equal to 168."
