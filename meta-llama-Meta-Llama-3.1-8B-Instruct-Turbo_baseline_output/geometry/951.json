    "model_solution": "To find the length of $\\overline{FD}$, we need to use the properties of the folded square and the crease line.\n\nLet's consider the folded square $ABCD$. After folding, $C$ coincides with $E$, the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$.\n\nThe length of $\\overline{FD}$ can be determined by considering the right triangle $FED$. Since $ED$ is half the side length of the square, $ED$ is $3$ cm.\n\nTo find the length of $\\overline{FD}$, we should use the fact that $EF$ is perpendicular to $FD$. This is because $EF$ represents the crease created by the fold, and $F$ and $E$ are on the same line after folding.\n\nSince $EF$ is perpendicular to $FD$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $\\overline{FD}$:\n\n$$(FD)^2 + (EF)^2 = (ED)^2$$\n\nWe know that $ED=3$, and since the square is folded, $EF$ must be equal to $CF$, which is $6- FD$. Substituting $6-FD$ for $EF$ in the equation above, we get:\n\n$$(FD)^2 + (6-FD)^2 = (ED)^2$$\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation:\n\n$$(FD)^2 + (36 - 12FD + (FD)^2) = (3)^2$$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$$2(FD)^2 - 12FD + 36 = 9$$\n\nSubtract 36 from both sides:\n\n$$2(FD)^2 - 12FD + 27 = 0$$\n\nNow, we should divide the entire equation by $2$:\n\n$$(FD)^2 - 6FD + 13.5 = 0$$\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation for $FD$, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$$x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$$\n\nIn this case, $a=1$, $b=-6$, and $c=13.5$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$$FD = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36-54}}{2}$$\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression under the square root:\n\n$$FD = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{-18}}{2}$$\n\nThis is a complex number, which doesn't make sense in this context. The length of a segment must be a non-negative number.\n\nHowever, let's try to solve the original quadratic equation using a different approach.\n\n$$(FD)^2 - 6FD + 13.5 = 0$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a=1$, $b=-6$, and $c=13.5$.\n\nTo solve this equation, we can try to factor it or use the quadratic formula. Since factoring doesn't seem to work, let's try to use the quadratic formula:\n\n$$x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$$\n\nHowever, this time, let's plug in the correct values for $a$, $b$, and $c$. We should have $a=2$, $b=-6$, and $c=27$ (we multiplied all of the terms by $2$).\n\n$$FD = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36-216}}{4}$$\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression under the square root:\n\n$$FD = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{-180}}{4}$$\n\nThis is a complex number, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nHowever, let's go back to the original equation and try to solve it by factoring. The equation is in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. This time, let's try to factor it:\n\n$$(FD)^2 - 6FD + 13.5 = 0$$\n\nUnfortunately, this equation doesn't factor easily.\n\nHowever, we should try to solve this equation using the quadratic formula with the correct values for $a$, $b$, and $c$. We should have $a=1$, $b=-6$, and $c=27$.\n\n$$FD = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36-108}}{2}$$\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression under the square root:\n\n$$FD = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{-72}}{2}$$\n\nThis is a complex number, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nHowever, let's try to solve this equation using a different approach.\n\nSince we can't solve this equation using the quadratic formula with real numbers, let's try to solve it using a different approach. We know that $FD$ is a segment with a positive length.\n\nIn this case, it might be easier to find the length of $FD$ using the Pythagorean Theorem in the right triangle $FED$.\n\nWe know that $EF$ is perpendicular to $FD$. Since $EF$ represents the crease created by the fold, $EF$ is parallel to $CB$, and $FD$ is parallel to $AB$.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the fact that the length of $\\overline{FD}$ can be determined by considering the right triangle $FED$. This triangle is a right triangle because $EF$ is perpendicular to $FD$.\n\nSince $ED$ is half the side length of the square, $ED$ is $3$ cm.\n\nTo find the length of $\\overline{FD}$, we can try to use the Pythagorean Theorem in the right triangle $FED$.\n\nHowever, let's try to solve this problem using a different approach.\n\nIn this case, it might be easier to find the length of $FD$ by drawing a line from $F$ to $D$.\n\nTo do this, let's consider the fact that the length of $\\overline{FD}$ can be determined by considering the right triangle $FED$.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the fact that the length of $\\overline{FD}$ can be determined by considering the right triangle $BFD$.\n\nTo do this, let's consider the right triangle $BFD$. Since $BD$ is half the side length of the square, $BD$ is $3$ cm.\n\nTo find the length of $\\overline{FD}$, we can try to use the Pythagorean Theorem in the right triangle $BFD$.\n\nLet's use the Pythagorean Theorem:\n\n$$(FD)^2 + (BF)^2 = (BD)^2$$\n\nWe know that $BD$ is $3$ cm. Since $BF$ represents the remaining part of the side $CD$, $BF$ is $FC$.\n\nWe also know that $FC$ is the same as $EF$. Since $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$, $EF$ is half the side length of the square.\n\nSo, $EF$ is $3$ cm.\n\nNow, let's substitute $3$ for $EF$ and $3$ for $BD$ in the equation:\n\n$$(FD)^2 + (3)^2 = (3)^2$$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$$(FD)^2 + 9 = 9$$\n\nSubtract $9$ from both sides:\n\n$$(FD)^2 = 0$$\n\nNow, let's take the square root of both sides:\n\n$$FD = \\sqrt{0}$$\n\nSince the square root of $0$ is $0$, the length of $\\overline{FD}$ is $0$.\n\nHowever, this can't be correct. There must be a different solution to this problem.\n\nTo find the length of $\\overline{FD}$, we should try to use the fact that the length of $FD$ can be determined by considering the right triangle $FED$.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the fact that the length of $\\overline{FD}$ can be determined by considering the right triangle $BFD$.\n\nTo do this, let's consider the right triangle $BFD$. Since $BD$ is half the side length of the square, $BD$ is $3$ cm.\n\nTo find the length of $\\overline{FD}$, we can try to use the Pythagorean Theorem in the right triangle $BFD$.\n\nHowever, we should try to use the fact that the length of $FD$ is equal to $CF$ minus $EF$.\n\nWe know that $CF$ is the same as $BF$. Since $BF$ represents the remaining part of the side $CD$, $BF$ is $6$ minus the length of $FD$.\n\nWe also know that $EF$ is $3$ cm.\n\nNow, let's set up an equation using the fact that the length of $FD$ is equal to $CF$ minus $EF$:\n\n$$FD = CF - EF$$\n\nSubstitute $6 - FD$ for $CF$ and $3$ for $EF$:\n\n$$FD = 6 - FD - 3$$\n\nAdd $FD$ to both sides:\n\n$$2FD = 3$$\n\nNow, let's divide both sides by $2$:\n\n$$FD = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n\nSo, the length of $\\overline{FD}$ is $\\frac{3}{2}$ cm."
