    "solution": "From the given information we know that $|a| |b| = |ab| = 2\\sqrt{26}$. We can also write $|ab| = |t-2i| = \\sqrt{t^2 + 4}$. Setting these equal, we have $$\\sqrt{t^2 + 4} = 2\\sqrt{26} \\Rightarrow\nt^2 + 4 = 104.$$The positive answer is $t = \\boxed{10}$.",

Since $|ab| = |a||b| = 2\\sqrt{26}$ and $|t-2i| = \\sqrt{t^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{t^2 + 4}$, we obtain:\n\n$$2\\sqrt{26} = \\sqrt{t^2 + 4}$$\n\nSquaring both sides and solving for $t$, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n4(26) &= t^2 + 4\\\\\n104 &= t^2 + 4\\\\\nt^2 &= 104 - 4\\\\\nt^2 &= 100\\\\\nt &= \\pm 10\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe are asked to find the positive value of $t$, so we take the positive root:\n\n$$t = 10$$"
