    "problem": "Let $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c$ for all real numbers $x$, where $c$ is some real number.  For what values of $c$ does $f(f(x))$ have exactly $3$ distinct real roots?",
    "solution": "Suppose the function $f(x) = 0$ has only one distinct root.  If $x_1$ is a root of $f(f(x)) = 0,$ then we must have $f(x_1) = r_1.$  But the equation $f(x) = r_1$ has at most two roots.  Therefore, the equation $f(x) = 0$ must have two distinct roots.  Let them be $r_1$ and $r_2.$\n\nSince $f(f(x)) = 0$ has three distinct roots, one of the equations $f(x) = r_1$ or $f(x) = r_2$ has one distinct root.  Without loss generality, assume that $f(x) = r_1$ has one distinct root.  Then $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c = r_1$ has one root.  This means\n\\[x^2 + 6x + c - r_1\\]must be equal to $(x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9 = 0,$ so $c - r_1 = 9.$  Hence, $r_1 = c - 9.$\n\nSince $r_1$ is a root of $f(x) = 0,$\n\\[(c - 9)^2 + 6(c - 9) + c = 0.\\]Expanding, we get $c^2 - 11c + 27 = 0,$ so\n\\[c = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{2}.\\]If $c = \\frac{11 - \\sqrt{13}}{2},$ then $r_1 = c - 9 = -\\frac{7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}$ and $r_2 = -6 - r_1 = \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{13}}{2},$ so\n\\[f(x) = x^2 + 6x + \\frac{11 - \\sqrt{13}}{2} = \\left( x + \\frac{7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\right) \\left( x + \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\right) = (x + 3)^2 - \\frac{7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}.\\]The equation $f(x) = r_1$ has a double root of $x = -3,$ and the equation $f(x) = r_2$ has two roots, so $f(f(x)) = 0$ has exactly three roots.\n\nIf $c = \\frac{11 + \\sqrt{13}}{2},$ then $r_1 = c - 9 = \\frac{-7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}$ and $r_2 = -6 - r_1 = -\\frac{5 + \\sqrt{13}}{2},$ and\n\\[f(x) = x^2 + 6x + \\frac{11 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} = \\left( x + \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\right) \\left( x + \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\right) = (x + 3)^2 + \\frac{-7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}.\\]The equation $f(x) = r_1$ has a double root of $x = -3,$ but the equation $f(x) = r_2$ has no real roots, so $f(f(x)) = 0$ has exactly one root.\n\nTherefore, $c = \\boxed{\\frac{11 - \\sqrt{13}}{2}}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the values of $c$ for which $f(f(x))$ has exactly $3$ distinct real roots, we first need to find the expression for $f(f(x))$.\n\nWe have $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c$. Substituting this into $f(f(x))$, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(f(x)) &= (x^2 + 6x + c) ^2 + 6(x^2 + 6x + c) + c\\\\\n&= x^4 + 12x^3 + (2c + 36)x^2 + (6c + 36)x + c^2 + 6c + c\\\\\n&= x^4 + 12x^3 + (2c + 36)x^2 + (6c + 36)x + c^2 + 7c\n\\end{align*}\n\nFor $f(f(x))$ to have exactly $3$ distinct real roots, the expression $x^4 + 12x^3 + (2c + 36)x^2 + (6c + 36)x + c^2 + 7c$ must have $3 = 2 + 1$ real roots of multiplicity $2$, and one real root of multiplicity $1$. However, the only way for a fourth-degree polynomial to have real roots of multiplicity $4$ is for the polynomial to be of the form $k(x - r)^4$ for some $k,r$; since we are assuming that the polynomial has $3$ distinct real roots, the coefficient of the $x^3$ term is nonzero, and the polynomial cannot be of the form $k(x - r)^4$. \n\nA fourth-degree polynomial can have real roots of multiplicity $4$, real roots of multiplicity $3$, and real roots of multiplicity $2$ if and only if it can be factored into three linear factors and one quadratic factor. This means that the polynomial $x^4 + 12x^3 + (2c + 36)x^2 + (6c + 36)x + c^2 + 7c$ must be of the form $(x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3)(x^2 + mx + n)$. Since the $x^3$ term is nonzero, the polynomial cannot be of the form $(x - r)^4$, and it must be of the form $(x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3)(x^2 + mx + n)$. \n\nIn order for this to be true, we must have $12 = -(r_1 + r_2 + r_3) + m$ and $m^2 - 4n = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3)$. We must also have $c^2 + 7c = n(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3) - m(r_1r_2r_3)$ and $c^2 + 36c + 36 = -m(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3) + n(r_1r_2r_3)$. \n\nTo get real roots of multiplicity $2$, we need the quadratic factor $x^2 + mx + n$ to have a repeated root. This means that $m^2 - 4n$ must be equal to zero, so we must have $(r_1 + r_2 + r_3)^2 = 4(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3)$. \n\nLet $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = a$ and $r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = b$. Then we have $a^2 = 4b$. \n\nWe also have $12 = -a + m$ and $m^2 - 4n = a$. Then we have $m = a - 12$ and $m^2 - 4n = a$.\n\nWe also have $c = -n$ and $c^2 + 7c = n(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3) - m(r_1r_2r_3)$. \n\nFrom the first equation, we get $n = -c$. We can substitute this into the second equation, and we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\nc^2 + 7c &= -c(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3) + m(r_1r_2r_3)\\\\\nc^2 + 7c &= -c(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3) + (a - 12)(r_1r_2r_3)\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe also have $c^2 + 36c + 36 = -m(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3) + n(r_1r_2r_3)$. Substituting $n = -c$, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\nc^2 + 36c + 36 &= (a - 12)(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3) - c(r_1r_2r_3)\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe have $a^2 = 4b$, so we can substitute $b = \\frac{a}{2}$ into the first equation. We get\n\n\\begin{align*}\nc^2 + 7c &= -c\\frac{a}{2} + (a - 12)(r_1r_2r_3)\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe also have $12 = -a + m$ and $m = a - 12$. \n\nSubstituting $m = a - 12$ into the equation $12 = -a + m$, we get $12 = -a + a - 12$. This implies that $0 = 0$, which is true for all $a$. So we can substitute $0 = 0$ into the equation $12 = -a + m$, and we get $0 = 0$. \n\nWe also have $c^2 + 36c + 36 = (a - 12)(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3) - c(r_1r_2r_3)$. \n\nSubstituting $c^2 + 7c = -c\\frac{a}{2} + (a - 12)(r_1r_2r_3)$ into the equation $c^2 + 36c + 36 = (a - 12)(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3) - c(r_1r_2r_3)$, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\nc^2 + 36c + 36 &= -c\\frac{a}{2} + (a - 12)(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3) - c(r_1r_2r_3)\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe have $-c\\frac{a}{2} = -c\\frac{a}{2}$ and $-c(r_1r_2r_3) = -c(r_1r_2r_3)$. We also have $(a - 12)(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3) = (a - 12)(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3) + (a - 12)(r_2r_3)$. \n\nWe can substitute $(a - 12)(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3)$ into the equation $c^2 + 36c + 36 = -c\\frac{a}{2} + (a - 12)(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3) - c(r_1r_2r_3)$, and we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\nc^2 + 36c + 36 &= -c\\frac{a}{2} + (a - 12)(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3) + (a - 12)(r_2r_3) - c(r_1r_2r_3)\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe have $r_1r_2r_3 = (r_1r_2r_3)$ and $(r_2r_3)(r_1r_2r_3) = (r_1r_2r_3)^2$.\n\nSubstituting $r_1r_2r_3 = (r_1r_2r_3)$ into the equation $c^2 + 36c + 36 = -c\\frac{a}{2} + (a - 12)(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3) + (a - 12)("
