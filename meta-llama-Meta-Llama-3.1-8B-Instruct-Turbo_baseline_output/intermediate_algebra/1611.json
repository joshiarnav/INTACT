    "problem": "A sequence $a_1$, $a_2$, $\\ldots$ of non-negative integers is defined by the rule $a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n|$ for $n\\geq1$. If $a_1=999$, $a_2<999$, and $a_{2006}=1$, how many different values of $a_2$ are possible?",
    "solution": "The condition $a_{n+2}=|a_{n+1}-a_n|$ implies that $a_n$ and $a_{n+3}$ have the same parity for all $n\\geq 1$. Because $a_{2006}$ is odd, $a_2$ is also odd.  Because $a_{2006}=1$ and $a_n$ is a multiple of $\\gcd(a_1,a_2)$ for all $n$, it follows that $1=\\gcd(a_1,a_2)=\\gcd(3^3\\cdot 37,a_2)$. There are 499 odd integers in the interval $[1,998]$, of which 166 are multiples of 3, 13 are multiples of 37, and 4 are multiples of $3\\cdot 37=111$. By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, the number of possible values of $a_2$ cannot exceed $499-166-13+4=\\boxed{324}$.\n\nTo see that there are actually 324 possibilities, note that for $n\\geq 3$, $a_n<\\max(a_{n-2},a_{n-1})$ whenever $a_{n-2}$ and $a_{n-1}$ are both positive.  Thus $a_N=0$ for some $N\\leq 1999$. If $\\gcd(a_1,a_2)=1$, then $a_{N-2}=a_{N-1}=1$, and for $n>N$ the sequence cycles through the values 1, 1, 0.  If in addition $a_2$ is odd, then $a_{3k+2}$ is odd for $k\\geq 1$, so $a_{2006}=1$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can start by computing the first few terms of the sequence for $a_1=999$ and $a_2<999$. We're given that $a_{2006}=1$. \n\nSince $a_{2006}=1$, and all terms after $a_3$ are the absolute difference of the two terms before it, then it must be the case that $a_{2005}=1$ and $a_{2004}=0$. \n\nWe can continue this logic and see that $a_3=|a_2-999|$, $a_4=|a_3-1|=|a_2-999-1|=|a_2-1000|$, $a_5=|a_4-0|=|a_2-1000|$, $a_6=|a_5-a_4|=0$, $a_7=|a_6-a_5|=|a_2-1000|$, $a_8=|a_7-a_6|=|a_2-1000|$, $a_9=|a_8-a_7|=|1000-a_2|$, $a_{10}=|a_9-a_8|=|1000-a_2|$, $a_{11}=|a_{10}-a_9|=0$, $a_{12}=|a_{11}-a_{10}|=|1000-a_2|$, and so on.\n\nLooking at the sequence, we can see that $a_3$, $a_4$, $a_5$, $a_6$, $a_7$, $a_8$, $a_9$, $a_{10}$, $a_{11}$, $a_{12}$, etc., all repeat in a cycle of length $6$, where $a_{n+6}=a_n$. This is because $a_{n+6}=|a_{n+5}-a_{n+4}|=|a_{n+4}-a_{n+3}|=|a_{n+3}-a_{n+2}|=|a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}|=|a_{n+1}-a_n|=a_n$.\n\nNow that we have a repeating cycle of length $6$, we can analyze the possible values of $a_2$ by analyzing the possible values of $a_3$, $a_4$, $a_5$, and $a_6$. \n\nSince $a_6=0$, then we know that $|a_2-999|$ and $|a_2-1000|$ must both be divisible by $6$. We can denote $|a_2-999|$ as $6k$ and $|a_2-1000|$ as $6m$.\n\nSince $a_2<999$, then $a_2$ must be less than $999$. We can write $a_2=999-6k$.\n\nNow we can write the equation $|a_2-1000|=|999-6k-1000|=|-k-1|=6m$. \n\nSince $|-k-1|$ is always equal to $|k+1|$, we can split the equation into two cases: \n\nCase 1: $k+1=6m$. In this case, we can write $a_2=999-6k=999-6(k-6m)=999-6(6m-1)=1005-36m$. \n\nTo ensure that $a_2<999$, we must have $1005-36m<999$. Solving this inequality, we get $m>1/36$.\n\nSince $m$ must be an integer, we can see that $m\\geq 2$. This means that there are infinitely many solutions in this case.\n\nCase 2: $-(k+1)=6m$. In this case, we can write $a_2=999-6k=999-6(-k-1-6m)=999-6(-6m-1-k)=999+36m+6k$.\n\nWe can write $a_2=999+36m+6k=999+6(6m+k)$. \n\nTo ensure that $a_2<999$, we must have $999+6(6m+k)<999$, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, there are no solutions in this case.\n\nThus, the only possible solutions are the ones in Case 1, where $a_2=1005-36m$ and $m\\geq 2$. \n\nSince $m\\geq 2$ and $m$ is an integer, the smallest value of $m$ is $2$. \n\nThe largest value of $m$ can be found by solving the equation $a_2=999<1005-36m$. \n\nSolving this equation, we get $m>26.25$.\n\nSince $m$ must be an integer, the largest value of $m$ is $27$.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $a_2$ are $a_2=1005-36m$ for $m=2,3,4,\\ldots,27$.\n\nThe number of possible values of $a_2$ is equal to the number of possible values of $m$, which is $27-2+1=26$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{26}$."
