    "problem": "One of the asymptotes of a hyperbola has equation $y=3x.$ The foci of the hyperbola have the same $x-$coordinate, which is $5.$ Find the equation of the other asymptote of the hyperbola, giving your answer in the form \"$y = mx + b$\".",
    "solution": "Because the foci both lie on the line $x=5$ and the center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the segment connecting the foci, the center must also lie on the line $x=5.$ However, we also know that the asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at the center. Therefore, the center of the hyperbola lies on both the line $x=5$ and the line $y=3x,$ so its coordinates are $(5, 15).$\n\nBecause the hyperbola has a horizontal axis, the other asymptote must have slope $-3.$ Therefore, we can write a point-slope equation for the other asymptote: \\[y - 15 = -3(x - 5),\\]which is equivalent to $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}.$",

    "model_solution": "Since the foci have the same x-coordinate of 5, the center of the hyperbola must also have an x-coordinate of 5. \n\nThe asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at the center of the hyperbola.  Since we know the equation of one of the asymptotes is $y = 3x$, the equation of the other asymptote must be of the form $y = mx$. \n\nSince the center of the hyperbola lies on both asymptotes, we know that the point (5, 15) lies on the first asymptote, and the point (5, 5m) lies on the second asymptote. \n\nSince both points have the same x-coordinate of 5, we know that the y-coordinates of both points must be equal, giving us the equation 15 = 5m.\n\nSolving for m, we get m = 15/5 = 3.\n\nHowever, we know the equation for one of the asymptotes, and since it's given that the slopes of the asymptotes are negatives of each other, the slope of the second asymptote is -3. \n\nBut we also know that the asymptotes are symmetric with respect to the center of the hyperbola, which has an x-coordinate of 5. So the equation of the asymptote is of the form $y = -3x + b$.\n\nSince the asymptote passes through the point (5, 15), we know that the equation of the asymptote is:\n\n15 = -3(5) + b\n\n15 = -15 + b\n\nb = 15 + 15\n\nb = 30\n\nThe equation of the other asymptote is y = -3x + 30."
