    "problem": "For how many real values of $c$ do we have $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$?",
    "solution": "We have $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\sqrt{{\\frac12}^2 + (-c)^2} = \\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14}$, so $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ gives us $\\sqrt{c^2 + \\frac14} = \\frac34$.  Squaring both sides gives $c^2 + \\frac14 = \\frac9{16}$, so $c^2=\\frac5{16}$.  Taking the square root of both sides gives $c = \\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ and $c=-\\frac{\\sqrt5}4$ as solutions, so there are $\\boxed{2}$ real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nWe also could have solved this equation by noting that $\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\frac34$ means that the complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is $\\frac34$ units from the origin in the complex plane.  Therefore, it is on the circle centered at the origin with radius $\\frac34$.  The complex number $\\frac12-ci$ is also on the vertical line that intersects the real axis at $\\frac12$, which is inside the aforementioned circle.  Since this line goes inside the circle, it must intersect the circle at $\\boxed{2}$ points, which correspond to the values of $c$ that satisfy the original equation.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation, we first need to expand the absolute value and set it equal to $\\frac34$. The absolute value of a complex number is defined as:\n\n$\\left|a+bi\\right| = \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$\n\nApplying this definition to the given equation, we get:\n\n$\\left|\\frac12-ci\\right| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2+(-c)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}+c^2}$\n\nSetting this equal to $\\frac34$, we have:\n\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}+c^2} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nSquaring both sides gives:\n\n$\\frac{1}{4}+c^2 = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{4}+c^2 = \\frac{9}{16}$\n\nSubtracting $\\frac{1}{4}$ from both sides gives:\n\n$c^2 = \\frac{9}{16} - \\frac{4}{16}$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$c^2 = \\frac{5}{16}$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n\n$c = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{16}}$\n\nSince the square root of a number has two possible values, the number of real values of $c$ that satisfy the equation is 2."
