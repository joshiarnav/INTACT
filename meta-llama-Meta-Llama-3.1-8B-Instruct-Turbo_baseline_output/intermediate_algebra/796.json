    "model_solution": "To find the locus of the centers of all circles externally tangent to $C_1$ and internally tangent to $C_2$, we can use the distance from the center of the circle to the two given circles.\n\nLet's denote the center of the circle as $(a, b)$.  Since the circle is externally tangent to $C_1$, the distance from the center $(a, b)$ to $C_1$ is the sum of the two radii.  The radius of $C_1$ is 1, so the distance between $(a, b)$ and $C_1$ is $1 + r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle (externally tangent to $C_1$ and internally tangent to $C_2$).  The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ can be found using the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.  Therefore, we can find the equation of the circle externally tangent to $C_1$ as follows:\n\n$\\sqrt{(a - 0)^2 + (b - 0)^2} = 1 + r$\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation gives:\n\n$a^2 + b^2 = (1 + r)^2$\n\nSimplifying this equation gives:\n\n$a^2 + b^2 = r^2 + 2r + 1$\n\nSince the circle is also internally tangent to $C_2$, the distance between the center $(a, b)$ and $C_2$ is the difference between the two radii.  The radius of $C_2$ is $\\sqrt{16} = 4$, so the distance between $(a, b)$ and $C_2$ is $r - 4$.  Using the distance formula, we can find the equation of the circle internally tangent to $C_2$ as follows:\n\n$\\sqrt{(a - 2)^2 + (b - 0)^2} = r - 4$\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation gives:\n\n$(a - 2)^2 + b^2 = (r - 4)^2$\n\nSimplifying this equation gives:\n\n$a^2 - 4a + 4 + b^2 = r^2 - 8r + 16$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $r^2 + 2r + 1$ from the first equation into this equation, we get:\n\n$a^2 - 4a + 4 + b^2 = (a^2 + b^2 - 1 - 2r) - 8r + 16$\n\nSimplifying this equation gives:\n\n$a^2 - 4a + 4 + b^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 1 - 2r - 8r + 16$\n\nCombining like terms gives:\n\n$-4a + 4 = -1 - 10r + 16$\n\nSimplifying this equation gives:\n\n$-4a = -17 - 10r$\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by -4 gives:\n\n$a = \\frac{17 + 10r}{4}$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $a^2 + b^2$ from the first equation into the equation for $r^2 + 2r + 1$, we get:\n\n$r^2 + 2r + 1 = a^2 + b^2$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $a$ into this equation, we get:\n\n$r^2 + 2r + 1 = \\left(\\frac{17 + 10r}{4}\\right)^2 + b^2$\n\nSimplifying this equation gives:\n\n$r^2 + 2r + 1 = \\frac{289 + 340r + 100r^2}{16} + b^2$\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 16 gives:\n\n$16r^2 + 32r + 16 = 289 + 340r + 100r^2 + 16b^2$\n\nRearranging the terms gives:\n\n$16r^2 - 100r^2 + 32r - 340r + 16 - 289 + 16b^2 = 0$\n\nSimplifying this equation gives:\n\n$-84r^2 - 308r - 273 + 16b^2 = 0$\n\nRearranging the terms gives:\n\n$16b^2 + 84r^2 + 308r + 273 = 0$\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 4 gives:\n\n$4b^2 + 21r^2 + 77r + \\frac{273}{4} = 0$\n\nThis is the locus of the centers of all circles externally tangent to $C_1$ and internally tangent to $C_2$."
