5.$ Since $C$ lies on the parabola, we have $q = -p^2 + 6p - 5.$\n\nWe can find the slope of the line $AB$ using the formula $\\dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}:$ \n\n$ m = \\dfrac{3 - 0}{4 - 1} = \\dfrac{3}{3} = 1$\n\nThe equation of line $AB$ can be written as\n\n$ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$\n\n$ y - 0 = 1(x - 1)$\n\n$ y = x - 1$\n\nNext, we will find the equation of line $AC$ using the formula for slope with the point $A$ and the unknown point $C$: \n\n$ m_{AC} = \\dfrac{q - 0}{p - 1}$\n\nSince $q = -p^2 + 6p - 5,$\n\n$ m_{AC} = \\dfrac{-p^2 + 6p - 5}{p - 1}$\n\nWe can use the point $B$ and the slope $m_{AC}$ to find the equation of the line $AC:$\n\n$ y - 3 = \\dfrac{-p^2 + 6p - 5}{p - 1}(x - 4)$\n\nWe can find the area of $\\triangle ABC$ by using the formula for the area of a triangle given the base and the height:\n\nThe base of $\\triangle ABC$ is the length of $AB,$ which is $3.$ \n\nIf the line $AC$ is parallel to the line $AB$, then the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is maximized.\n\nThe line $AB$ is $y = x - 1.$\n\nThe line $AC$ is $y = \\dfrac{-p^2 + 6p - 5}{p - 1}(x - 4) + 3$\n\nFor these two lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal:\n\n$ m_{AB} = m_{AC}$\n\n$ 1 = \\dfrac{-p^2 + 6p - 5}{p - 1}$\n\n$ p - 1 = -p^2 + 6p - 5$\n\n$ -p^2 + 6p - 5 = p - 1$\n\n$ -p^2 + 5p - 4 = 0$\n\n$ -(p^2 - 5p + 4) = 0$\n\n$ p^2 - 5p + 4 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and it can be factored as:\n\n$ (p - 1)(p - 4) = 0$\n\nThis equation has two possible solutions: $p = 1$ and $p = 4$.\n\nSince $p$ is between $1$ and $4,$ the only possible value for $p$ is $p = 4.$\n\nHowever, this value does not maximize the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nTo maximize the area of $\\triangle ABC,$ we will find the line that is perpendicular to $AB$ and passes through the midpoint of $AB.$ \n\nThe coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(1,0)$ and $(4,3),$ respectively.\n\nThe midpoint of $AB$ is $\\left(\\dfrac{1 + 4}{2}, \\dfrac{0 + 3}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\dfrac{5}{2}, \\dfrac{3}{2}\\right)$\n\nThe slope of line $AB$ is $1.$\n\nThe slope of a line perpendicular to line $AB$ is $-1.$\n\nThe equation of a line perpendicular to $AB$ and passing through the midpoint of $AB$ is\n\n$ y - \\dfrac{3}{2} = -1\\left(x - \\dfrac{5}{2}\\right)$\n\n$ y - \\dfrac{3}{2} = -x + \\dfrac{5}{2}$\n\n$ y = -x + 4$\n\nTo maximize the area of $\\triangle ABC,$ the line $AC$ must be perpendicular to the line $AB$ and pass through point $C.$\n\nThe slope of line $AC$ is $1$ (since it is perpendicular to the line $AB$ with slope $-1$), and the line passes through the point $(p,q).$\n\nThe equation of the line $AC$ is\n\n$ y - q = 1(x - p)$\n\n$ y - q = x - p$\n\n$ y = x - p + q$\n\nWe can substitute the equation of the parabola, $y = -x^2 + 6x - 5,$ into the equation for the line $AC$:\n\n$ -x^2 + 6x - 5 = x - p + q$\n\n$ -x^2 + 5x - (p - q - 5) = 0$\n\nTo find the largest possible area of $\\triangle ABC,$ we will find the value of $p$ that maximizes the height of $\\triangle ABC,$ which is the perpendicular distance between the line $AB$ and the line $AC$.\n\nThe line $AB$ is $y = x - 1,$ and the line $AC$ is $y = x - p + q.$\n\nThe perpendicular distance between two lines can be calculated using the formula\n\n$ D = \\dfrac{|Ax + By + C|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}$\n\nFor the lines $y = x - 1$ and $y = x - p + q,$ we have\n\n$ A = 1, B = -1, C = p - q - 5$\n\nThe distance is\n\n$ D = \\dfrac{|(1)(x) - (1)(x) + (p - q - 5)|}{\\sqrt{(1)^2 + (-1)^2}}$\n\n$ D = \\dfrac{|p - q - 5|}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe height of $\\triangle ABC$ is $h = \\dfrac{|p - q - 5|}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nWe can substitute the equation of the parabola into this expression:\n\n$ h = \\dfrac{|p - (-p^2 + 6p - 5) - 5|}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n$ h = \\dfrac{|p^2 - 5p + 5|}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nSince $p^2 - 5p + 5$ is a quadratic function, to maximize the area of $\\triangle ABC,$ we need to maximize $p^2 - 5p + 5.$ \n\nTo find the maximum of $p^2 - 5p + 5,$ we will find the vertex of the parabola $y = p^2 - 5p + 5.$ \n\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex is given by the formula\n\n$ p = \\dfrac{-b}{2a}$\n\n$ p = \\dfrac{-(-5)}{2(1)}$\n\n$ p = \\dfrac{5}{2}$\n\nTo maximize the area of $\\triangle ABC,$ the value of $p$ must be at the vertex of the parabola $y = p^2 - 5p + 5,$ which is $p = \\dfrac{5}{2}.$ \n\nSince $p$ must be between $1$ and $4,$ the value of $p$ that maximizes the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $p = \\dfrac{5}{2}.$ \n\nHowever, this value is outside the given range of $p.$ \n\nTo maximize the area of $\\triangle ABC$ within the given range of $p,$ we will find the value of $p$ that maximizes the height of $\\triangle ABC.$ \n\nSince the height of $\\triangle ABC$ is $h = \\dfrac{|p^2 - 5p + 5|}{\\sqrt{2}},$ we can find the value of $p$ that maximizes this function within the given range.\n\nTo find this value, we can use the second derivative test.\n\nThe first derivative of $h$ is\n\n$ \\dfrac{dh}{dp} = \\dfrac{2p - 5}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe second derivative of $h$ is\n\n$ \\dfrac{d^2h}{dp^2} = \\dfrac{2}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nWe can evaluate the second derivative of $h$ at the endpoints of the interval to determine whether the maximum value of $h$ occurs at one of the endpoints.\n\nSince the second derivative of $h$ is positive, the function $h$ is concave up.\n\nTo find the maximum value of $h$ within the given range, we will evaluate the function $h$ at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nThe endpoints of the interval are $p = 1$ and $p = 4.$\n\nWe can evaluate the function $h$ at these points to find the maximum value of $h$ within the given range.\n\nThe value of $h$ at $p = 1$ is\n\n$ h(1) = \\dfrac{|(1)^2 - 5(1) + 5|}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n$ h(1"
