    "problem": "Find the roots of $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$. Enter your answer as a list of numbers separated by commas.",
    "solution": "Since the polynomial has no constant term, we can immediately factor out an $x$ from every term\n$$x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20),$$and our first root $x=0$. Let $g(x) = 6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$. Then the remaining roots of our original polynomial are the roots of $g(x)$. By trying out simple values, we can see that $g(0) = 20 > 0$ and $g(1) = 6+19-51+20 = -6<0$. Thus, there must be a root of $g(x)$ between $0$ and $1$. From the Rational Root Theorem, we know that if $g(p/q) = 0$ then $p$ must divide $20$ and $q$ must divide $6$.\n\nChecking rational numbers of the form $p/q$, where $p$ divides $20$ and $q$ divides $6$, and $p/q$ is between $0$ and $1$, we find that\n$$\\begin{aligned} g\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) &= 6\\cdot\\frac{1}{8}+19\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}-51\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}+20 = 0.\n\\end{aligned}$$This means that $2x - 1$ is a factor of $g(x).$ Dividing by $2x-1$ gives us $g(x) = (2x-1)(3x^2+11x-20)$.\n\nThe quadratic $3x^2+11x-20$ factors as $(3x-4)(x+5),$ so our last two roots are $4/3$ and $-5$.\n\nThus, the roots of $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$ are $\\boxed{0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{4}{3}, -5}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the roots of the polynomial $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$, we can try to factor out an $x$ from the polynomial:\n\n$$6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x = x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20)$$\n\nWe can then try to factor the remaining cubic polynomial using various techniques, but none seem to work easily. However, let's try to use the Rational Root Theorem, which states that if a rational number $p/q$ is a root of the polynomial $a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_0$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers, then $p$ must be a factor of the constant term $a_0$ and $q$ must be a factor of the leading coefficient $a_n$. \n\nFor the polynomial $6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$, the factors of the constant term 20 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 5, \\pm 10, \\pm 20$, and the factors of the leading coefficient 6 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6$. \n\nWe can use these possible roots to test for rational roots. \n\nUsing synthetic division or the remainder theorem, we find that x=0 is a root, so we can factor out an $x$:\n\n$$6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x = x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20)$$\n\nWe also find that x=4/3 is a root of the cubic polynomial, so we can factor out $(x-4/3)$:\n\n$$6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x = x(x-4/3)(6x^2+25x-15)$$\n\nNow, we can try to factor the quadratic polynomial $6x^2+25x-15$. \n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find that the roots of the quadratic polynomial are $\\frac{-25 \\pm \\sqrt{625+360}}{12} = \\frac{-25 \\pm \\sqrt{985}}{12} = \\frac{-25 \\pm 7\\sqrt{35}}{12}$. \n\nHowever, since we are looking for a list of numbers separated by commas, and the answer should be in simplest form, we leave the irrational roots in this form.\n\nTherefore, the roots of the polynomial $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$ are:\n\n$0, \\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{-25 + 7\\sqrt{35}}{12}, \\frac{-25 - 7\\sqrt{35}}{12}$"
