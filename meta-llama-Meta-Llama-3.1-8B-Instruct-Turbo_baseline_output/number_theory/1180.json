    "solution": "To find the least common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, we ignore 1 and prime factorize the rest to obtain $2, 3, 2^2, 5, 2\\cdot 3, 7, 2^3$, and $3^2$. Taking the maximum exponent for each prime, we find that the least common multiple is $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{2520}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest number divisible by integers 1 through 9, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two-digit numbers. \n\nThe prime factorization of the numbers 1 through 9 is as follows:\n- 1: 1 (no prime factor)\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 3\n- 4: 2^2\n- 5: 5\n- 6: 2 * 3\n- 7: 7\n- 8: 2^3\n- 9: 9 (3^2)\n\nTo find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor:\n\n- 2 appears with the highest power of 3 (from 8)\n- 3 appears with the highest power of 2 (from 9)\n- 5, 7 are prime numbers, so they appear with a power of 1\n\nThe LCM is therefore: 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 = 2520\n\nSo, the smallest number divisible by integers 1 through 9 is 2520."
