    "problem": "In a physical education class, students line up in four rows to do exercises. One particular class has over 30 students, with three rows having the same number of students and one row having one more student than the other three rows. What is the smallest possible class size for this physical education class?",
    "solution": "If the first three rows have 1 student, the last row must have two students, so there are 5 students in total. This is not greater than 30, so we must add another student to each row. This gives 9, which is still not greater than 30. We have to keep adding 4 until we get to a number greater than 30. As a result, we reach 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33. 33 is the first integer greater than 30, so this class has $\\boxed{33}$ students.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem. We have three rows with the same number of students, and one row with one more student. Let's call the number of students in each of the three rows 'x', and the number of students in the fourth row 'x + 1'.\n\nSince there are three rows with 'x' students each, the total number of students in these three rows is 3x. The total number of students in the fourth row is x + 1. \n\nThe total number of students in the class is the sum of the students in all four rows, which is 3x + (x + 1). To find the smallest possible class size, we want to find the smallest value of x that satisfies the condition that the total number of students is greater than 30.\n\nWe can write an inequality to represent this:\n\n3x + (x + 1) > 30\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4x + 1 > 30\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n4x > 29\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nx > 7.25\n\nSince x must be an integer (we can't have a fraction of a student), the smallest possible value of x is 8. \n\nNow, let's find the total number of students in the class:\n\n3x + (x + 1) = 3(8) + (8 + 1)\n= 24 + 9\n= 33\n\nThe smallest possible class size for this physical education class is 33 students."
