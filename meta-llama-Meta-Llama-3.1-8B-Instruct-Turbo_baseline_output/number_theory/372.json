    "problem": "A positive five-digit integer is in the form $AB,CBA$; where $A$, $B$ and $C$ are each distinct digits. What is the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven?",
    "solution": "We can test an integer for divisibility by $11$ by alternately adding and subtracting its digits.  For example, $8162$ is divisible by 11 because $8-1+6-2=11$ is divisible by 11.  In this case, $2A-2B+C$ must be divisible by 11.  If there are satisfactory values of $B$ and $C$ corresponding to $A=9$, then the resulting integer would be larger than any integer with $A<9$.  Therefore, we try $A=9$ first.  If $A=9$, then $C-2B+18$ must be divisible by $11$.  Equivalently, $C-2B$ equals $-7$ or $4$, which implies $C=2B-7$ or $C=2B+4$.  Wanting to make $B$ as large as possible, we try $B=9,8,7,\\ldots$. $B$ cannot be $9$ because $A$, $B$, and $C$ must be distinct.  If $B=8$, then $C=9$, so again the digits are not distinct.  If $B=7$, then $C=7$ and still the digits are not distinct.  If $B=6$, then $C=5$, and $AB,\\!CBA=\\boxed{96,\\!569}$.",

    "model_solution": "A number is divisible by 11 if and only if the alternating sum of its digits is a multiple of 11. \n\nThe given number is in the form $AB,CBA$ so it can be expressed as $10000A + 1000B + 100C + 10B + A = 10001A + 1010B + 100C$.\n\nThe alternating sum of its digits is $A - B + C - B + A = 2A - 2B + C$.\n\nWe need $2A - 2B + C$ to be a multiple of 11. \n\nTo find the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$, we start by choosing a large value for $A$. The greatest single digit multiple of 11 is 9, but $9 - B + C$ may be too small if $B$ and $C$ are large. \n\nIf $A = 9$, we have $18 - 2B + C = 11k$ for some integer $k$. Since $18 - 2B + C$ is even, we know $k$ is even.\n\nSince $18 - 2B + C$ is between 0 and 22 inclusive, the only values of $k$ possible are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. \n\nHowever, the only even values in that list are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. \n\nWe can try each of $B = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$ to see if we obtain an integer solution for $C$. \n\n$B = 0$: Then $18 + C = 11k$ which is not possible for any $k$.\n\n$B = 1$: Then $16 + C = 11k$ which is not possible for any $k$.\n\n$B = 2$: Then $14 + C = 11k$ which is not possible for any $k$.\n\n$B = 3$: Then $12 + C = 11k$ which is not possible for any $k$.\n\n$B = 4$: Then $10 + C = 11k$ which is not possible for any $k$.\n\n$B = 5$: Then $8 + C = 11k$ which is not possible for any $k$.\n\n$B = 6$: Then $6 + C = 11k$ which is not possible for any $k$.\n\n$B = 7$: Then $4 + C = 11k$ which is not possible for any $k$.\n\n$B = 8$: Then $2 + C = 11k$ which is not possible for any $k$.\n\n$B = 9$: Then $C = 11k$ which is not possible for any $k$ as $C$ cannot equal 0.\n\nHowever, if $A = 9$ and $B = 8$ then we have $18 - 16 + C = 2 + C$ which must be a multiple of 11.
