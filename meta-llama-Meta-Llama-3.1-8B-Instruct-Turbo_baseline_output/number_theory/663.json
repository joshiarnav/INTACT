(Interpret $AB_6$ as a base-6 number with digits $A$ and $B$, not as $A$ times $B$. The other expressions should be interpreted in this way as well).",
    "solution": "Dealing with the second condition, it is set up in the following manner. $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&&C_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&0_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$Because $B+C$ can not equal $0$, we must carry in this column. Therefore, we arrive at two equations. $B+C-6=0$ and $A+1=C$ Looking at the third condition: $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&B&A_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&C_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$We can determine that no carrying occurs. Therefore, $A+B=C$. We now have a system of equations for our three variables. \\[B+C-6=0\\]\\[A+1=C\\]\\[A+B=C\\]Subtracting the third equation from the second, $1-B=0$, or $B=1$. Plugging that into our first equation we can determine that $C=5$. $A$ must then equal $4$. Thus, $\\overline{ABC}$ is $\\boxed{415}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.\n\nGiven the first equation: ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$.\n\nIn base-6, when we add a single digit $C$ to a two-digit number $AB$, the result ends with $0$. This can only happen if the units digit $B$ plus $C$ equals $0$ (in base-10), and the carry from that addition equals $6$. \n\nSo, we have the following possibilities for $B$ and $C$:\n1. $B + C = 6$, and there's a carry of $1$.\n2. $B + C = 12$ (in base-6), which equals $8$ (in base-10), and there's a carry of $2$.\n\nSince $B$ and $C$ are distinct digits less than $6$, the only valid combination for the first case is $B = 2$ and $C = 4$.\n\nFor the second case, $B + C = 12$ in base-6, which means $B + C = 8$ in base-10. Considering the given constraints, the pair $B = 4$ and $C = 4$ is invalid since $B$ and $C$ should be distinct. The only valid combination for the second case is $B = 2$ and $C = 6$, but this is also invalid because $C$ must be less than $6$. \n\nSo, we are left with the pair $B = 2$ and $C = 4$ from the first case.\n\nNow, let's consider the second equation: ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$.\n\nSubstituting $B = 2$ and $C = 4$ into the equation, we get: ${A2_6}+{2A_6}={44_6}$.\n\nIn base-6, when we add two two-digit numbers $A2$ and $2A$, the result is $44$. Since the sum of the units digits $2 + 2 = 4$ (in base-6), we don't need a carry here.\n\nThe only possibility for the tens digits is $A + 2 + A = 2 + 4$, considering the carry from the units digit addition. This implies $A + A + 2 = 6$, or $2A + 2 = 6$.\n\nSolving for $A$, we get $2A = 4$, which implies $A = 2$.\n\nHowever, we already know that $A$ must be distinct from $B$, so $A$ cannot equal $2$. \n\nLet's reconsider the first equation: ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$.\n\nIn base-6, when we add a single digit $C$ to a two-digit number $AB$, the result ends with $0$. This can only happen if the units digit $B$ plus $C$ equals $0$ (in base-10), and the carry from that addition equals $6$.\n\nHowever, there is another possibility for the carry and sum of units digits. In base-6, the carry can be $2$ if $B + C = 8$ (in base-10), and in this case, the sum of the units digits is $0$ (since there's a carry of $2$).\n\nConsidering this case, we have $B + C = 8$, and the only valid combination of distinct digits less than $6$ is $B = 5$ and $C = 3$.\n\nNow, let's consider the second equation: ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$.\n\nSubstituting $B = 5$ and $C = 3$ into the equation, we get: ${A5_6}+{5A_6}={33_6}$.\n\nIn base-6, when we add two two-digit numbers $A5$ and $5A$, the result is $33$. Since the sum of the units digits $5 + A$ equals $3$ (in base-6), we have the only possibility of $A + 3 = 3$, or $A = 0$. However, we know that $A$ cannot equal $0$ since it's a non-zero digit.\n\nHowever, we already know that the only valid combination for the units digit $B + C$ is $B + C = 8$ (in base-10), and in this case, the sum of the units digits $5 + A$ could also equal $3$ and $5$ as $A = 4$ in base-10.\n\nLet's substitute $A = 4$ and check if the equation holds.\n\nSubstituting $A = 4$ into the equation, we get: ${45_6}+{54_6}={33_6}$.\n\nConverting these numbers to base-10 for verification: \n$45_6 = (4*6) + 5 = 24 + 5 = 29$, \n$54_6 = (5*6) + 4 = 30 + 4 = 34$, \n$33_6 = (3*6) + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21$.\n\nSo, $45_6+54_6 = 29 + 34 = 63$ in base-10, which is equal to $33_6$ in base-6. Therefore, $A = 4$ is a valid solution.\n\nNow that we have the values of $A$, $B$, and $C$, we can form the three-digit number ${ABC}$.\n\nSubstituting the values of $A = 4$, $B = 5$, and $C = 3$, we get the three-digit number ${435}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{435}$."
