    "solution": "$n^3 \\equiv 888 \\pmod{1000} \\implies n^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ and $n^3 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125}$. $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$ due to the last digit of $n^3$. Let $n = 5a + 2$. By expanding, $125a^3 + 150a^2 + 60a + 8 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125} \\implies 5a^2 + 12a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$.\nBy looking at the last digit again, we see $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod5$, so we let $a = 5a_1 + 3$ where $a_1 \\in \\mathbb{Z^+}$. Plugging this in to $5a^2 + 12a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$ gives $10a_1 + 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$. Obviously, $a_1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$, so we let $a_1 = 5a_2 + 2$ where $a_2$ can be any non-negative integer.\nTherefore, $n = 2 + 5(3+ 5(2+5a_2)) = 125a_2 + 67$. $n^3$ must also be a multiple of $8$, so $n$ must be even. $125a_2 + 67 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2 \\implies a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Therefore, $a_2 = 2a_3 + 1$, where $a_3$ is any non-negative integer. The number $n$ has form $125(2a_3+1)+67 = 250a_3+192$. So the minimum $n = \\boxed{192}$.",

    "model_solution": "We can start by looking at the last three digits of the cube. We are given that the cube ends in $888$. \n\nWe can consider the last digit of the cube:\n\n$$(n^3) \\mod 10$$\n\nThis will only be possible if the last digit of $n$ is $2$, as $2^3 = 8$. \n\nNext, we consider the last two digits of the cube:\n\n$$(n^3) \\mod 100$$\n\nFor the cube to end in $88$, we can use the fact that $n^2 \\mod 25$ is divisible by $2$ but not $4$, which will give us:\n\n$$n^2 \\equiv 2,6,7,12,17,22 \\mod 25$$\n\nHowever, since we know $n^2 \\mod 25$ is divisible by $2$ but not $4$, the only possibilities are $n^2 \\equiv 2,6,7,12,17 \\mod 25$. This implies that $n^2 \\equiv 2,7 \\mod 25$. \n\nTherefore, the possible values for $n$ are the numbers $n \\equiv 7,12,17,22 \\mod 25$ and $n \\equiv 2,7,12,17,22,27,32,37,42,47,52,57,62,67,72,77,82,87,92,97 \\mod 25$. We also need to check for the last three digits of $n^3$ as:\n\n$$n^3 \\equiv n \\cdot n^2 \\equiv n \\cdot 2,7 \\mod 25$$\n\nCombining the two, we get the following possibilities:\n\n$$n \\equiv 7,12,17,22,27,57 \\mod 25$$\n\nSince we are looking for the smallest positive integer, we test the first number in this list, which is $n \\equiv 2 \\mod 5$ and $n \\equiv 7 \\mod 25$, and find the smallest solution to be:\n\n$$n = 192$$\n\nSo the smallest positive integer whose cube ends in $888$ is $\\boxed{192}$."
