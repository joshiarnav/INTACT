    "problem": "Chloe wants to buy a hoodie that costs $\\$32.75$. She empties her wallet and finds she only has three $\\$10$ bills, eight quarters, and a pile of dimes. What is the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ represent the unknown number of dimes. Chloe's total amount of money is $$3(\\$10)+8(\\$.25)+n(\\$.10) \\ge \\$32.75.$$Simplifying gives  \\begin{align*}\n30+2+.10n &\\ge 32.75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\n.10n &\\ge .75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge \\frac{.75}{.10} \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge 7.5.\n\\end{align*}Chloe must have at least $\\boxed{8}$ dimes in her pile.",

    "model_solution": "To find the minimum number of dimes, we first need to calculate the total amount Chloe has from her $\\$10$ bills and quarters. \n\nThree $\\$10$ bills will give her $3 \\times 10 = 30$ dollars. Eight quarters will give her $8 \\times 0.25 = 2$ dollars. So, the total amount from the bills and quarters is $30 + 2 = 32$ dollars.\n\nShe is short $\\$0.75$ for the hoodie. The remaining amount is in dimes, which are $\\$0.10$ each. To find the minimum number of dimes, we divide the remaining amount by the value of a dime:\n\n$\\$0.75 / \\$0.10 = 7.5$\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a dime, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, Chloe needs at least 8 dimes to have enough money to buy the hoodie."
