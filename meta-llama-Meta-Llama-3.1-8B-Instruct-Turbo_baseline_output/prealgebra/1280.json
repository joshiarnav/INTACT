    "problem": "The number 74 can be factored as 2(37), so 74 is said to have two distinct prime factors. How many distinct prime factors does 210 have?",
    "solution": "We know that $210 = 10 \\cdot 21$. Breaking down these factors even further, we have that $10 = 2 \\cdot 5$ and $21 = 3 \\cdot 7$, so $210 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. Since these factors are all prime, $210$ has $\\boxed{4}$ distinct prime factors.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of distinct prime factors of 210, we first need to factorize 210. \n\n210 can be factorized as follows: \n210 = 2 * 105 \n= 2 * 3 * 35 \n= 2 * 3 * 5 * 7\n\nSo the distinct prime factors of 210 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. \n\nTherefore, 210 has 4 distinct prime factors."
