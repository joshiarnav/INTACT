    "model_solution": "To compute $0.18\\dev0.003$, we can use the fact that dividing by a number with a decimal point less than 1 can be done by moving the decimal point in the numerator to the right by the number of places that the denominator's decimal point is less than 1.\n\nIn this case, 0.003 has 3 places less than 1 (all places less than 1), so we move the decimal point in 0.18 to the right by 3 places, which gives us 180.\n\nSo, $0.18\\div0.003 = 180\\div3 = 60$."
