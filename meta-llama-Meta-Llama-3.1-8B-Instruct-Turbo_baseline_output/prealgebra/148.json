    "problem": "The average of the numbers 23 and $x$ is 27. What is the positive difference between 23 and $x$? (Recall that the average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2).",
    "solution": "To calculate the average of two numbers, we add them and divide the sum by $2$.  From the given information, we have the equation  \\[\\frac{23+x}{2}=27.\\]  Multiplying both sides by $2$ yields \\[23+x=54.\\]  Thus, $x=54-23=31$.  Finally, the positive difference between $31$ and $23$ is \\[31-23=\\boxed{8}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To find the average of 23 and x, we need to add them together and divide by 2. \n\nWe are given that the average of 23 and x is 27. So, we can write:\n\n(23 + x) / 2 = 27\n\nTo find x, we can multiply both sides by 2:\n\n23 + x = 54\n\nThen, we can subtract 23 from both sides:\n\nx = 54 - 23\nx = 33\n\nNow, we need to find the positive difference between 23 and x. The positive difference between two numbers is the absolute value of their difference.\n\ndifference = |23 - x| = |23 - 33| = |-10| = 10\n\nTherefore, the positive difference between 23 and x is 10."
