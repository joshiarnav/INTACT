    "problem": "The product of three different positive integers is equal to $7^3$. What is the sum of the three integers?",
    "solution": "All three integers must be divisors of $7^3$.  The only divisors of $7^3$ are $7^0$, $7^1$, $7^2$, $7^3$.  We have $7^3=7^0\\times7^1\\times7^2$. Thus our answer is $7^0+7^1+7^2=1+7+49=\\boxed{57}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the three different positive integers, we need to find the prime factorization of $7^3$. The prime factorization of $7^3$ is $7 \\times 7 \\times 7$.\n\nHowever, we need three different integers. To find three different positive integers that multiply to $7^3$, we need to find three different prime factors of $7^3$. \n\nOne possible combination of three different positive integers is $1, 7, 49$ (since $1 \\times 7 \\times 49 = 7^3$). \n\nThe sum of these three integers is $1 + 7 + 49 = 57$."
