    "problem": "Angela has $a$ marbles, Brian has twice as many marbles as Angela, Caden has three times as many marbles as Brian, and Daryl has five times the number of marbles Caden has. If in total Angela, Brian, Caden and Daryl have 78 marbles, what is the value of $a?$",
    "solution": "First, quantify the number of marbles each person has:\n\n$\\bullet$ Angela has $a$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Brian has $2\\times a$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Caden has $3\\times(2\\times a)$ marbles.\n\n$\\bullet$ Daryl has $5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))$ marbles.\n\nIn total, the four people have $a+2\\times a+3\\times(2\\times a)+5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))$ marbles. And that expression equals 78, since in total the four people have 78 marbles. Now evaluate the resulting equation. \\begin{align*}\n78&=a+2\\times a+3\\times(2\\times a)+5\\times(3\\times(2\\times a))\\\\\n&=a+2a+3(2a)+5(3(2a))\\\\\n&=a+2a+6a+5(6a)\\\\\n&=a+2a+6a+30a\\\\\n&=39a \\quad\\implies\\\\\na&=\\boxed{2}.\n\\end{align*}",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to express the number of marbles each person has in terms of $a$ (the number of marbles Angela has). \n\nBrian has twice as many marbles as Angela, so he has 2$a$ marbles. \nCaden has three times as many marbles as Brian, so he has 3 * 2$a$ = 6$a$ marbles. \nDaryl has five times the number of marbles Caden has, so he has 5 * 6$a$ = 30$a$ marbles.\n\nNow, we can write an equation to represent the total number of marbles: \n$a$ (Angela's marbles) + 2$a$ (Brian's marbles) + 6$a$ (Caden's marbles) + 30$a$ (Daryl's marbles) = 78\n\nCombining like terms, we get: \n39$a$ = 78\n\nTo solve for $a$, we divide both sides by 39:\n$a$ = 78 / 39\n$a$ = 2\n\nSo, Angela has 2 marbles."
