    "file_name": "./MATH_subsample_uniform/prealgebra/1896.json",
    "model_solution": "To find the median value of the 59 salaries, we need to arrange the salaries in order from lowest to highest. \n\nSince 37 of the employees are Administrative Specialists with a salary of $\\$23{,}000$, the middle value will be the 30th salary (because 59 is an odd number, the middle value is the 30th value). \n\nThe first 37 values are $\\$23{,}000$, so we don't need to look at the salaries of the lower-paying titles. \n\nThe next 10 values are $\\$50{,}000$, and the 30th value would be the 7th $\\$50{,}000$ (since we've already counted the first 37 salaries).\n\nTherefore, the median value is $\\$50{,}000$, which is the salary for an Associate Director."
