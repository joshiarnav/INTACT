    "problem": "What is the smallest positive number that is prime and $10$ less than a perfect square?",
    "solution": "A number 10 less than an even perfect square cannot be prime, so let's check odd perfect squares greater than 10:\n\n$\\bullet$ $5^2=25,$ $25-10=15,$ composite.\n\n$\\bullet$ $7^2=49,$ $49-10=39,$ composite.\n\n$\\bullet$ $9^2=81,$ $81-10=71.$\n\nChecking prime numbers up to $7$ $($the  largest prime less than $\\sqrt{71})$ as potential divisors, we  see that $71$ is prime. Thus, the smallest prime that is $10$ less  than a perfect square is $\\boxed{71}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest positive number that is prime and 10 less than a perfect square, let's first consider the properties of perfect squares and prime numbers.\n\nA perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer, i.e., $n^2$, where $n$ is an integer.\n\nA prime number is a number that is divisible by only 1 and itself.\n\nSince we are looking for a number that is 10 less than a perfect square, let's consider the first few perfect squares and subtract 10 from them:\n\n1. $1^2 - 10 = -9$ (not positive)\n2. $2^2 - 10 = -6$ (not positive)\n3. $3^2 - 10 = -1$ (not positive)\n4. $4^2 - 10 = 6$ (not prime)\n5. $5^2 - 10 = 15$ (not prime)\n6. $6^2 - 10 = 26$ (not prime)\n7. $7^2 - 10 = 39$ (not prime)\n8. $8^2 - 10 = 54$ (not prime)\n9. $9^2 - 10 = 71$ (prime)\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive number that is prime and 10 less than a perfect square is 71."
