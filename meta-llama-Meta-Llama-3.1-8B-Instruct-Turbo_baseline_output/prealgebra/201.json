    "problem": "If only one quarter of the earth's surface is not covered by bodies of water, and only one half of that exposed land area is inhabitable for humans (because of poles, deserts, etc.), what fraction of the earth's surface can humans live on?",
    "solution": "One half of one quarter of the earth is $\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{4}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$.",

    "model_solution": "If one quarter of the earth's surface is not covered by bodies of water, then the fraction of the earth's surface not covered by bodies of water is 1/4.\n\nSince only one half of that exposed land area is inhabitable for humans, the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on is (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8.\n\nSo, the fraction of the earth's surface that humans can live on is 1/8."
