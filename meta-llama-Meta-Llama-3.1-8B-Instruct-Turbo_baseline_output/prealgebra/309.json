    "problem": "In a history class, the probability of earning an A is .7 times the probability of earning a B, and the probability of earning a C is 1.4 times the probability of earning a B. Assuming that all grades are A, B, or C, how many B's will there be in a history class of 31 students?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of students who earn a B. Then we know that the number of students who get an A is $.7x$ and the number of students who earn a C is $1.4x$. Since every student in the class gets an A, B, or C and there are 31 students, this gives us the equation $.7x + x + 1.4x = 31 \\Rightarrow 3.1x = 31 \\Rightarrow x =\\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's define the probability of earning a B as p(B). \n\nGiven that the probability of earning an A is .7 times the probability of earning a B:\np(A) = .7 * p(B)\n\nGiven that the probability of earning a C is 1.4 times the probability of earning a B:\np(C) = 1.4 * p(B)\n\nSince the only possible grades are A, B, or C, the sum of their probabilities should be 1:\np(A) + p(B) + p(C) = 1\n\nSubstituting the expressions for p(A) and p(C) in terms of p(B) into the equation above:\n.7 * p(B) + p(B) + 1.4 * p(B) = 1\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n3.1 * p(B) = 1\n\nDividing both sides by 3.1 to solve for p(B):\np(B) = 1 / 3.1\np(B) \u2248 0.3226\n\nSince the probability of earning a B is approximately 0.3226, the expected number of B's in a class of 31 students is:\nNumber of B's \u2248 p(B) * 31\n\u2248 0.3226 * 31\n\u2248 10\n\nSo, in a history class of 31 students, there will be approximately 10 B's."
