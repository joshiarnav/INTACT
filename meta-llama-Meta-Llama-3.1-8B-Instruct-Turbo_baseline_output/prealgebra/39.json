    "solution": "The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so we must have \\[\\angle M + \\angle A + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle S = 540^\\circ.\\] Since $\\angle A$ and $\\angle S$ are supplementary, we have $\\angle A +\\angle S = 180^\\circ$.  Combining this with $\\angle H = \\angle M = \\angle T$, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\angle M + \\angle A + \\angle T + \\angle H + \\angle S& =\n(\\angle M + \\angle T + \\angle H) \\\\\n&\\qquad+ (\\angle A +\\angle S) \\\\\n&= 3\\angle H + 180^\\circ,\\end{align*} so $3\\angle H + 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ$.  Therefore, $3\\angle H = 360^\\circ$ and $\\angle H = \\boxed{120^\\circ}$.",

    "model_solution": "In a pentagon, the sum of all interior angles is 540 degrees. \n\nSince $\\angle M \\cong \\angle T \\cong \\angle H$, let's call the measure of these three angles x. Therefore, we have:\n\nx + x + x + $\\angle A$ + $\\angle S$ = 540\n\nIt is given that $\\angle A$ is supplementary to $\\angle S$. Therefore, $\\angle A$ + $\\angle S$ = 180.\n\nNow we can substitute this into our equation:\n\nx + x + x + 180 = 540\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x + 180 = 540\n\nSubtract 180 from both sides:\n\n3x = 360\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 120\n\nSince x is the measure of $\\angle H$, we have:\n\nThe measure of $\\angle H$ is 120 degrees."
