    "problem": "We have a cube with 4 blue faces and 2 red faces.  What's the probability that when it is rolled, a blue face will be facing up?",
    "solution": "We have 6 equally likely outcomes, corresponding to the 6 faces of the cube.  4 of those 6 outcomes are successful ones (meaning a blue face is facing up).  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability of a blue face facing up when the cube is rolled, we need to divide the number of blue faces by the total number of faces.\n\nThere are 4 blue faces and a total of 6 faces on the cube.\n\nSo, the probability of a blue face facing up is 4/6, which can be simplified to 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a blue face will be facing up when the cube is rolled is 2/3 or approximately 66.67%."
