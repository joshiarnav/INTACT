    "problem": "If $\\frac{5}{33}$ is expressed in decimal form, what digit is in the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point?",
    "solution": "When we write $\\frac{5}{33}$ as a decimal using long division, we get $0.\\overline{15}=0.15151515\\ldots$. Notice the pattern we have here: if $n$ is odd, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal point is $1$; if $n$ is even, then the digit at the $n$th place to the right of the decimal place is $5$. Since $92$ is an even number, the digit at the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point is $\\boxed{5}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point, we can first convert $\\frac{5}{33}$ into decimal form. \n\nTo do this, we can use long division. We divide 5 by 33 to get the decimal representation:\n\n0.151515151...\n\nThe decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{33}$ has a repeating block of 6 digits: 151515. This block repeats indefinitely.\n\nSince 92 is 6 times 15, with a remainder of 2, the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point will be the second digit in the repeating block, which is 5.\n\nTherefore, the digit in the 92nd place to the right of the decimal point is 5."
