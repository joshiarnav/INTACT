    "problem": "A number in the set $\\{50, 51, 52, 53, ... , 999\\}$ is randomly selected. What is the probability that it is a two-digit number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "To count the number of numbers in this set, we subtract 49 from all of the numbers, giving the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 950 \\}$, making it obvious that there are 950 numbers total. Furthermore, the set $\\{ 50, 51, 52, \\ldots, 98, 99 \\}$ corresponds to the more easily counted $\\{ 1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 49, 50 \\}$ by subtracting 49. So, the probability of selecting a two-digit number is $\\frac{50}{950} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that a randomly selected number from the set $\\{50, 51, 52, 53, ... , 999\\}$ is a two-digit number, we need to find the total number of two-digit numbers in the set and the total number of numbers in the set.\n\nThe set starts from 50 and ends at 999. So, the total number of numbers in the set is $999 - 50 + 1 = 950$.\n\nThe two-digit numbers in the set start from 50 and end at 99. So, the total number of two-digit numbers in the set is $99 - 50 + 1 = 50$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected number is a two-digit number is $\\frac{50}{950} = \\frac{1}{19}$."
