    "solution": "Note that\n\\[\\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ 7 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(7) = 11,\\]so the matrix scales the area of any region by a factor of 11.  In particular, the area of $S'$ is $11 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{44}.$",

The determinant of the matrix is\n\n\\[\\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ 7 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(7) = 4 + 7 = 11.\\]\n\nSo, the area of $S'$ is equal to the area of $S$ multiplied by 11, which is $4 \\cdot 11 = 44.$ Therefore, the area of $S'$ is 44."
