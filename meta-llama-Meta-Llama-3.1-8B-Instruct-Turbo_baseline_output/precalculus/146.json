    "problem": "A certain regular tetrahedron has three of its vertices at the points $(0,1,2),$ $(4,2,1),$ and $(3,1,5).$  Find the coordinates of the fourth vertex, given that they are also all integers.",
    "solution": "The side length of the regular tetrahedron is the distance between $(0,1,2)$ and $(4,2,1),$ which is\n\\[\\sqrt{(0 - 4)^2 + (1 - 2)^2 + (2 - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{18} = 3 \\sqrt{2}.\\]So if $(x,y,z)$ is the fourth vertex, with integer coordinates, then\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 2)^2 &= 18, \\\\\n(x - 4)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + (z - 1)^2 &= 18, \\\\\n(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 5)^2 &= 18.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting the first and third equations, we get $6x + 6z - 30 = 0$, so $x + z = 5,$ which means $z = 5 - x.$  Subtracting the first and second equation, we get $8x + 2y - 2z - 16 = 0,$ so\n\\[y = z - 4x + 8 = (5 - x) - 4x + 8 = 13 - 5x.\\]Substituting into the first equation, we get\n\\[x^2 + (12 - 5x)^2 + (3 - x)^2 = 18.\\]This simplifies to $27x^2 - 126x + 135 = 0,$ which factors as $9(x - 3)(3x - 5) = 0.$  Since $x$ is an integer, $x = 3.$  Then $y = -2$ and $z = 2.$  Thus, the fourth vertex is $\\boxed{(3,-2,2)}.$",

    "model_solution": "Given the points A(0, 1, 2), B(4, 2, 1) and C(3, 1, 5), we need to find a fourth point D(x, y, z) that also lies on the regular tetrahedron.\n\nTo do this, let's first find the side length of the tetrahedron, which is the distance between points A and B:\n\nAB = sqrt((4 - 0)^2 + (2 - 1)^2 + (1 - 2)^2)\n= sqrt(16 + 1 + 1)\n= sqrt(18)\n= 3*sqrt(2)\n\nThe centroid of the regular tetrahedron is the average of its vertices. Since we know the points A, B, and C, we can find the centroid of the triangle ABC, and then use it to find the fourth point D.\n\nThe centroid of a triangle is (x1+x2+x3)/3, (y1+y2+y3)/3, (z1+z2+z3)/3.\n\nThe centroid of triangle ABC = ((0+4+3)/3, (1+2+1)/3, (2+1+5)/3)\n= (7/3, 4/3, 8/3)\n\nSince the centroid of the tetrahedron is also the centroid of triangle ABC, we can use it to find the fourth point D. The centroid of the tetrahedron is (x_avg, y_avg, z_avg) = ((0 + 4 + 3 + x_avg)/4, (1 + 2 + 1 + y_avg)/4, (2 + 1 + 5 + z_avg)/4)\n\nSince the centroid (7/3, 4/3, 8/3) = ((0 + 4 + 3 + x_avg)/4, (1 + 2 + 1 + y_avg)/4, (2 + 1 + 5 + z_avg)/4), we get the following equations:\n\nx_avg + 7 = 4 * 7/3\nx_avg = 28/3 - 7\nx_avg = 7/3\n\ny_avg + 4 = 4 * 4/3\ny_avg = 16/3 - 4\ny_avg = 4/3\n\nz_avg + 8 = 4 * 8/3\nz_avg = 32/3 - 8\nz_avg = 8/3\n\nHowever, we have to make sure x_avg, y_avg and z_avg are integers, so we must consider the fact that the coordinates of D(x, y, z) also lie on the regular tetrahedron and the equation of the plane that contains points A, B and C is a * x + b * y + c * z + d = 0.\n\nThe equation of the plane that contains points A, B, and C is a * x + b * y + c * z + d = 0. We can find the equation of the plane using the points A, B, and C.\n\nUsing the cross product to find the normal vector to the plane:\n    | i  j  k |\n    | 0  1  2 |\n  x | 4  2  1 |\n  y | 3  1  5 |\n\nThe cross product of vectors AX and AY is the vector AN, whose components are found as follows:\n\nn_x = (1*5 - 2*1) = 3\nn_y = (2*3 - 1*4) = 2\nn_z = (1*4 - 3*2) = -2\n\nThe equation of the plane is then 3 * x + 2 * y -2 * z + d = 0. We can substitute the coordinates of points A, B, or C to find d.\n\nSubstituting point A(0, 1, 2) into the equation of the plane:\n3 * 0 + 2 * 1 -2 * 2 + d = 0\n-2 + d = 0\nd = 2\n\nThe equation of the plane is 3 * x + 2 * y -2 * z + 2 = 0.\n\nSubstituting the coordinates of the centroid (7/3, 4/3, 8/3) into the equation of the plane:\n3 * (7/3) + 2 * (4/3) - 2 * (8/3) + 2 = 0\n7 + 8/3 - 16/3 + 2 = 0\n7 + 2 - 8/3 = 0\n(21 + 6 - 8)/3 = 0\n19/3 = 0\n\nHowever, this does not hold true. We cannot use this centroid.\n\nNow, considering the distance between points A and D is the side length of the tetrahedron, we can find the coordinates of the fourth point D(x, y, z).\n\nAD = AB = sqrt((4 - 0)^2 + (2 - 1)^2 + (1 - 2)^2)\n= sqrt(16 + 1 + 1)\n= sqrt(18)\n= 3*sqrt(2)\n\nUsing the distance formula, AD^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2\n\nWe also know that AD^2 = (x - 0)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 2)^2\n\nSetting AD^2 equal to (3*sqrt(2))^2, we get:\n\n18 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2\n18 = (x - 0)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 2)^2\n\nUsing the equation of the plane that contains points A, B, and C, we can eliminate x, y, and z from the equation:\n\n3 * x + 2 * y -2 * z + 2 = 0\n\nWe can substitute x from the equation 3 * x + 2 * y -2 * z + 2 = 0 into the equation 18 = (x - 0)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 2)^2.\n\nFirst, we square both sides of the equation 18 = (x - 0)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 2)^2\nThen we get: 324 =  x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2*(x*y + x*z + y*z) - 4*(x + y + z) + 5\nSince we know x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 18, we get:\n324 = 18 + 2*(x*y + x*z + y*z) - 4*(x + y + z) + 5\nSubtracting 23 from both sides, we get:\n301 = 2*(x*y + x*z + y*z) - 4*(x + y + z)\n\nNow, we use the equation 3 * x + 2 * y -2 * z + 2 = 0 to express x + y + z in terms of x, y, and z:\n\nx + y + z = -2/(-2) = 1\n\nSubstituting x + y + z = 1 into the equation 301 = 2*(x*y + x*z + y*z) - 4*(x + y + z), we get:\n\n301 = 2*(x*y + x*z + y*z) - 4*(1)\n301 = 2*(x*y + x*z + y*z) - 4\nSubtracting 301 from both sides, we get:\n0 = 2*(x*y + x*z + y*z) - 305\nAdding 305 to both sides, we get:\n305 = 2*(x*y + x*z + y*z)\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n152.5 = x*y + x*z + y*z\n\nNow, we can use the fact that x + y + z = 1 to express x*y + x*z + y*z in terms of x, y, and z:\n\nx*y + x*z + y*z = (x + y + z)^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2\nx*y + x*z + y*z = (1)^2 - 18\nx*y + x*z + y*z = 1 - 18\nx*y + x*z + y*z = -17\n\nSubstituting x*y + x*z + y*z = -17 into the equation 152.5 = x*y + x*z + y*z, we get:\n\n152.5 = -17\nHowever, 152.5 is not equal to -17. We must have made an error somewhere.\n\nSince points A, B, and C are the vertices of the regular tetrahedron, they must be equidistant from point D.\n\nThe distances between points A and D, B and D, and C and D must be equal. \n\nLet's use the distance formula to find the distances between points A and D, B and D, and C and D.\n\nAD = sqrt((x - 0)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 2)^2)\n= sqrt(x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + (z - 2)^2)\n\nBD = sqrt((x - 4)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + (z - 1)^2)"
