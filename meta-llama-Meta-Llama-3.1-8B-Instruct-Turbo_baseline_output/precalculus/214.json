    "model_solution": "To find the number of $x$-intercepts of the graph of $y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x}$ in the interval $(0.0001, 0.001),$ we need to find the values of $x$ for which $\\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0.$ \n\nThe sine function has zeros at integer multiples of $\\pi,$ so we need to solve the equation $\\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi$ for positive integers $n.$ This gives $x = \\frac{1}{n\\pi}.$\n\nWe want to find the number of $x$-intercepts in the interval $(0.0001, 0.001),$ so we need to find the number of positive integers $n$ for which $\\frac{1}{n\\pi}$ is in this interval. \n\nWe can rewrite the interval as $\\frac{1}{1000} < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < \\frac{1}{100}.$ Taking the reciprocal of the inequality, we get $1000\\pi < n\\pi < 100\\pi.$ Dividing the inequality by $\\pi,$ we get $1000 < n < 100\\pi.$ Since $n$ must be an integer, the number of possible values of $n$ is the number of integers between $1000$ and $100\\pi.$ \n\nTo find this, we can divide $100\\pi$ by $1000$ to get an approximate number of integers. We have $\\frac{100\\pi}{1000} \\approx 3.18,$ so the number of integers between $1000$ and $100\\pi$ is $3.$ \n\nHowever, we must also account for the lower bound of the interval. The smallest possible value of $n$ is $1001$ since $n$ is at least $1000.$ Therefore, the number of $x$-intercepts in the interval $(0.0001, 0.001)$ is $3.$\n\nThus the final answer is $\\boxed{3}.$"
