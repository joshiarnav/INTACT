    "solution": "From the equation $a^3 b^5 = 1,$ $a^6 b^{10} = 1.$  From the equation $a^7 b^2 = 1,$ $a^{35} b^{10} = 1.$  Dividing these equations, we get\n\\[a^{29} = 1.\\]Therefore, $a$ must be a 29th root of unity.\n\nFrom the equation $a^7 b^2 = 1,$ $a^{14} b^4 = 1.$  Hence,\n\\[\\frac{a^3 b^5}{a^{14} b^4} = 1.\\]This leads to $b = a^{11}.$\n\nConversely, if $a$ is a 29th root of unity, and $b = a^{11},$ then\n\\begin{align*}\na^3 b^5 &= a^3 (a^{11})^5 = a^{58} = 1, \\\\\na^7 b^2 &= a^7 (a^{11})^2 = a^{29} = 1.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the solutions $(a,b)$ are of the form $(\\omega, \\omega^{11}),$ where $\\omega$ is a 29th root of unity, giving us $\\boxed{29}$ solutions.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of complex numbers such that \n$a^3 b^5 = a^7 b^2 = 1.$\n\nWe start by raising both sides of the first equation to the power of 2, and raise both sides of the second equation to the power of 5. We have \n\\[(a^3 b^5)^2 = 1^2 \\qquad (a^7 b^2)^5 = 1^5\\]\nThis simplifies to \n\\[a^6 b^{10} = 1 \\qquad a^{35} b^{10} = 1\\]\n\nNow, we can divide the second equation by the first equation to get \n\\[\\frac{a^{35} b^{10}}{a^6 b^{10}} = \\frac{1}{1}.\\]\nThis simplifies to \n\\[a^{29} = 1\\]\n\nSince we have $a^{29} = 1$, we can write $a$ as $a = e^{\\frac{2\\pi i k}{29}}$, where $0 \\le k \\le 28.$ \n\nSubstituting this into the equation $a^3 b^5 = 1$ gives us\n\\[(e^{\\frac{2\\pi i k}{29}})^3 b^5 = 1.\\]\n\nThis simplifies to\n\\[e^{\\frac{6\\pi i k}{29}} b^5 = 1.\\]\n\nWe can then raise both sides to the power of 2 and then take the fifth root of both sides to get\n\\[b = e^{\\frac{-10\\pi i k}{29}}.\\]\n\nSubstituting this back into our earlier equation $a^3 b^5 = 1$ gives us\n\\[e^{\\frac{6\\pi i k}{29}} e^{\\frac{-50\\pi i k}{29}} = 1.\\]\n\nThis simplifies to\n\\[e^{\\frac{-44\\pi i k}{29}} = 1.\\]\n\nWe can raise both sides to the power of $\\frac{29}{2}$ to get\n\\[e^{\\frac{-29\\cdot 2\\pi i k}{29}} = 1.\\]\n\nThis simplifies to\n\\[e^{-2\\pi i k} = 1.\\]\n\nThis is true for any integer $k$, but we are only interested in values for $k$ that are between 0 and 28.\n\nSince we are looking for ordered pairs of complex numbers, for each $k$ that makes $a = e^{\\frac{2\\pi i k}{29}}$ a complex number, we get one corresponding complex number for $b = e^{\\frac{-10\\pi i k}{29}}$.\n\nThe values for $k$ that make $a = e^{\\frac{2\\pi i k}{29}}$ a complex number are 0, 1, 2, ..., 28.\n\nHowever, when $k = 0$, $b = 1$ and there are no other solutions for $b$ when $k = 0$.\n\nTherefore, we have 28 complex values for $a$ that correspond to 28 complex values for $b$.\n\nSo the final answer is $\\boxed{29}$"
