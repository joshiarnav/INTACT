    "model_solution": "To perform a dilation centered at a point, we need to translate the point to the origin, perform the dilation, and then translate it back.\n\nFirst, translate the point $2i$ and the center $-1 + 4i$ to the origin by subtracting the center from both points. The vector from the center to $2i$ is $(2i) - (-1 + 4i) = 1 - 2i.$\n\nNow, we need to perform the dilation with scale factor $-2$. Multiply the vector $1 - 2i$ by $-2$ to get $-2(1 - 2i) = -2 + 4i.$\n\nFinally, translate the point back by adding the center to the result. The point is $(-2 + 4i) + (-1 + 4i) = -3 + 8i.$"
