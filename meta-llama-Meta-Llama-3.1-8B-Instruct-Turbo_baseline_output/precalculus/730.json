    "model_solution": "To find $|z|$, we can start by using the fact that $|wz| = |w|\\cdot|z|$. \n\nWe have that $|w| = \\sqrt{13}$.  To find $|wz|$, we can use the fact that if $z = a + bi$, then $|z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ and if $c + di$ is a complex number, then $|c + di| = \\sqrt{c^2 + d^2}$. \n\nGiven that $wz = 12 - 8i$, we have that $|wz| = \\sqrt{12^2 + (-8)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 64} = \\sqrt{208} = 4\\sqrt{13}$.\n\nNow we can use the equation $|wz| = |w|\\cdot|z|$. We have that $|wz| = 4\\sqrt{13}$ and $|w| = \\sqrt{13}$, so $4\\sqrt{13} = \\sqrt{13} \\cdot |z|$. \n\nDividing both sides by $\\sqrt{13}$, we have that $|z| = \\frac{4\\sqrt{13}}{\\sqrt{13}} = 4$."
