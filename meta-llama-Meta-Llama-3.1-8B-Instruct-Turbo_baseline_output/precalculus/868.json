    "solution": "Two angles have the same tangent if and only if they differ by a multiple of $\\pi.$  This means $\\tan x - x$ is a multiple of $\\pi.$  Let\n\\[T(x) = \\tan x - x.\\]First, we prove that the function $T(x)$ is strictly increasing on the interval $\\left[ 0, \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right).$  Let $0 \\le x < y < \\frac{\\pi}{2}.$  Then\n\\[y - x < \\tan (y - x) = \\frac{\\tan y - \\tan x}{1 + \\tan x \\tan y} \\le \\tan y - \\tan x.\\]Re-arranging, we get $\\tan x - x < \\tan y - y,$ or $T(x) < T(y).$\n\nNote that as $x$ approaches $\\frac{\\pi}{2},$ $T(x)$ approaches infinity.  This means for every nonnegative integer $n,$ there exists a unique value of $x$ such that $T(x) = n \\pi.$\n\nWe have the estimate $300 \\pi \\approx 942.48.$  Hence,\n\\[T(\\tan^{-1} 942) = 942 - \\tan^{-1} 942 < 942 < 300 \\pi.\\]Also,\n\\[T(\\tan^{-1} 924) = 942 - \\tan^{-1} 942 > 942 - \\frac{\\pi}{2} > 299 \\pi.\\]Since $299 \\pi < T(\\tan^{-1} 942) < 300 \\pi,$ the equation $T(x) = n \\pi$ has a solution on the interval $[0, \\tan^{-1} 942]$ if and only if $0 \\le n < 300,$ so there are $\\boxed{300}$ solutions.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of solutions of the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$, we need to analyze the behavior of the functions involved.\n\nSince we are given the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$, we will assume $x$ is within the domain of the inverse tangent function. \n\nLet $y = \\tan x$ and $z = \\tan (\\tan x)$. We want to find the solutions to the equation $y = z$.\n\nConsider the function $f(y) = \\tan^{-1} y$. Then we want to find the solutions to the equation $x = f(y) = \\tan^{-1} y$, which is equivalent to $\\tan x = y$.\n\nSince $x = f(y) = \\tan^{-1} y$, we have that $\\tan (\\tan^{-1} y) = y$.\n\nTherefore, we have that $\\tan x = y$ if and only if $\\tan (\\tan x) = y$.\n\nSince $y = \\tan x$, we have that $\\tan (\\tan x) = \\tan y = \\tan (\\tan^{-1} y) = y$.\n\nTherefore, the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ has a solution if and only if $\\tan^{-1} y = x$.\n\nNow, consider the function $g(x) = \\tan x$. This function is increasing on the interval $\\left( -\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right)$. \n\nNote that $x$ and $g(x)$ are both defined on the interval $\\left( -\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right)$.\n\nTherefore, $g(x)$ is one-to-one on the interval $\\left( -\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right)$.\n\nSince the function $g(x) = \\tan x$ is one-to-one on the interval $\\left( -\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right)$, we have that $g(x) = g(y)$ if and only if $x = y$.\n\nTherefore, the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ has a solution if and only if $x = y$, which is equivalent to $\\tan x = x$.\n\nWe need to find the number of solutions of the equation $\\tan x = x$ on the interval $0 \\le x \\le 942$.\n\nSince $x$ and $\\tan x$ are both increasing functions on the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the graph of the function $y = \\tan x$ intersects the line $y = x$ twice on this interval, at the points $(0,0)$ and $(\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{4})$.\n\nSince the line $y = x$ is steeper than the graph of the function $y = \\tan x$ on the interval $(\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, there are no solutions to the equation $\\tan x = x$ on this interval.\n\nTherefore, the equation $\\tan x = x$ has exactly two solutions on the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nNow, consider the interval $x \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Since $x \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have that $\\tan x \\ge \\tan (\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\infty$, which is not in the domain of the function $f(x) = \\tan^{-1} x$.\n\nTherefore, the equation $\\tan x = x$ has no solutions on the interval $x \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nSince the equation $\\tan x = x$ has exactly two solutions on the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we need to check if the equation $\\tan x = x$ has any solutions on the interval $\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$.\n\nWe have that $\\tan^{-1} 942 \\approx 1.4714$, which is greater than $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nSince the function $f(x) = \\tan^{-1} x$ is increasing and continuous on the interval $(0, \\infty)$, we have that the equation $\\tan x = x$ has a solution if and only if $\\tan x = \\tan^{-1} x$.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the number of solutions of the equation $\\tan x = \\tan^{-1} x$ on the interval $\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$.\n\nSince the equation $\\tan x = x$ has exactly two solutions on the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we need to find the number of solutions of the equation $\\tan x = x$ on the interval $\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$.\n\nSince the function $f(x) = \\tan^{-1} x$ is increasing and continuous on the interval $(0, \\infty)$, we have that the equation $\\tan x = x$ has a solution if and only if $\\tan x = \\tan^{-1} x$.\n\nThe equation $\\tan x = \\tan^{-1} x$ can be rewritten as $\\tan x = \\ln \\left(\\frac{1+x}{1-x}\\right)$.\n\nSince the function $\\ln \\left(\\frac{1+x}{1-x}\\right)$ is increasing and continuous on the interval $(-1,1)$, we have that the equation $\\tan x = \\ln \\left(\\frac{1+x}{1-x}\\right)$ has a solution if and only if $\\tan x = \\ln \\left(\\frac{1+x}{1-x}\\right)$.\n\nSince the function $\\tan x$ is increasing and continuous on the interval $(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, we have that the equation $\\tan x = \\ln \\left(\\frac{1+x}{1-x}\\right)$ has a solution if and only if $x = \\ln \\left(\\frac{1+x}{1-x}\\right)$.\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as $x = \\ln \\left(\\frac{1+x}{1-x}\\right)$, which can be rewritten as $e^x = \\frac{1+x}{1-x}$.\n\nSince the function $f(x) = e^x$ is increasing and continuous on the interval $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, we have that the equation $e^x = \\frac{1+x}{1-x}$ has a solution if and only if $e^x \\ge \\frac{1+x}{1-x}$.\n\nSince the function $f(x) = \\frac{1+x}{1-x}$ is increasing and continuous on the interval $(-1,1)$, we have that the inequality $e^x \\ge \\frac{1+x}{1-x}$ holds for all $x \\in (-1,1)$.\n\nSince the function $e^x$ is increasing and continuous on the interval $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, we have that the inequality $e^x \\ge \\frac{1+x}{1-x}$ holds for all $x \\ge 1$.\n\nSince the function $e^x$ is increasing and continuous on the interval $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, we have that the inequality $e^x \\ge \\frac{1+x}{1-x}$ holds for all $x \\ge 1$.\n\nSince the function $\\frac{1+x}{1-x}$ is increasing and continuous on the interval $(-1,1)$, we have that the inequality $e^x \\ge \\frac{1+x}{1-x}$ holds for all $x \\in (-1,1)$.\n\nTherefore, the equation $\\tan x = x$ has exactly three solutions on the interval $\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$.\n\nSince the equation $\\tan x = x$ has exactly two solutions on the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have that the equation $\\tan x = x$ has exactly five solutions on the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$.\n\nTherefore, the equation $\\tan x = \\tan (\\tan x)$ has exactly five solutions on the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\tan^{-1} 942$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"
