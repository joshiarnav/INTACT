    "solution": "First, we can factor out $1000=10^3$, so $\\sqrt[3]{2744000}=10\\sqrt[3]{2744}$.  To proceed, we can take out factors of two from 2744, to find that $2744=2\\cdot1372=2\\cdot2\\cdot686=2^3\\cdot343$.  With a little bit of guess and check, notice that $7^3=343$.  Therefore, $10\\sqrt[3]{2744}=10(14)=\\boxed{140}$.",

    "model_solution": "To simplify $\\sqrt[3]{2744000}$, we can factor out the perfect cubes.\n\nFirst, we look for a perfect cube that is a factor of 2744000. \n\nWe can start by trying to find a perfect cube that is close to 2744000. We know that $30^3 = 27000$ and $40^3 = 64000$, which are both less than 2744000.\n\nHowever, we can try to find the cube root of 2744000 by breaking it down into smaller parts. \n\nWe can write 2744000 as $2744 * 1000$.\n\nNow, we look for perfect cubes in 2744 and 1000. \n\nFor 2744, we can write it as $14^3 * 7^3 * 2^3 * 2^3$.\n\nFor 1000, we can write it as $10^3$.\n\nNow, let's simplify. We can take out $14^3 * 7^3 * 10^3$, which will give us:\n\n$\\sqrt[3]{2744000} = \\sqrt[3]{14^3 * 7^3 * 2^3 * 2^3 * 10^3}$\n\nNow, we can simplify the cube root of each factor:\n\n$\\sqrt[3]{14^3 * 7^3 * 2^3 * 2^3 * 10^3} = 14 * 7 * 2 * 2 * 10$\n\nNow, let's simplify the multiplication:\n\n$14 * 7 * 2 * 2 * 10 = 1960$\n\nNow, our answer is in the format $\\boxed{answer}$."
