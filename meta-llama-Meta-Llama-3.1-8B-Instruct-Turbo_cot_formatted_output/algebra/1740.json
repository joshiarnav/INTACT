    "problem": "A box with a volume of 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold 50 paperclips. How many paperclips could a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ hold?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of paperclips that a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ could hold. Setting up the ratio $\\frac{50}{16}=\\frac{x}{48}$ and solving for $x$ gives $x=150$.  Hence, a 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ box could hold $\\boxed{150}$ paperclips.  We also could have noted that tripling the size of the box triples the number of paperclips we can hold, so the new box can hold $50\\cdot 3 = 150$ paperclips.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of paperclips that a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold, we need to determine the ratio of the volumes of the two boxes.\n\nThe volume of the first box is 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ and it can hold 50 paperclips. \n\nThe volume of the second box is 48 $\\text{cm}^3$.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the ratio of the two volumes. To do this, we divide the volume of the second box by the volume of the first box.\n \n48 $\\text{cm}^3$ / 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ = 3\n\nThis means the second box is 3 times larger than the first box.\n\nNow, we can use this ratio to find the number of paperclips that the second box can hold. Since the second box is 3 times larger than the first box, it can hold 3 times more paperclips.\n\nNumber of paperclips in the second box = Number of paperclips in the first box * 3\n= 50 * 3\n= 150\n\nTherefore, the box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold $\\boxed{150}$ paperclips."
