    "problem": "The Cookie Monster encounters a cookie whose boundary is the equation $x^2+y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3 y$ and is very confused. He wants to know if this cookie is a lunch-sized cookie or a snack-sized cookie. What is the radius of this cookie?",
    "solution": "The equation $x^2+y^2 - 6.5 = x + 3 y$ can be rewritten as $x^2-x+y^2-3y=6.5$. Completing the square and writing decimals as fractions, this can further be rewritten as $\\left( x - \\dfrac{1}{2} \\right)^2 - \\dfrac{1}{4} + \\left( y - \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)^2 - \\dfrac{9}{4}=\\dfrac{13}{2}$. Moving the constants to the right side of the equation, this is $\\left( x - \\dfrac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( y - \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)^2 = \\dfrac{10}{4}+\\dfrac{13}{2}=\\dfrac{18}{2}=9$, which is the equation of a circle with center $\\left( \\dfrac{1}{2}, \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right)$ and radius $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To determine the radius of the cookie, we need to rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$. \n\nFirst, let's rearrange the given equation: \n$x^2+y^2 - x - 3y = 6.5$\n\nNext, we need to group the x-terms and y-terms together:\n\n$(x^2 - x) + (y^2 - 3y) = 6.5$\n\nNow, let's complete the square for both x and y:\n$(x^2 - x + \\frac{1}{4}) + (y^2 - 3y + \\frac{9}{4}) = 6.5 + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{9}{4}$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n$(x - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + (y - \\frac{3}{2})^2 = 6.5 + \\frac{10}{4}$\n\nNow, let's simplify the right side of the equation:\n$(x - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + (y - \\frac{3}{2})^2 = 6.5 + 2.5$\n\nCombine the numbers on the right side of the equation:\n$(x - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + (y - \\frac{3}{2})^2 = 9$\n\nNow that the equation is in standard form, we can identify the radius. In the equation, $r^2 = 9$, and to find the radius, we need to take the square root of both sides of the equation. Therefore, \n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3.$\n\n$\\boxed{3}$"
