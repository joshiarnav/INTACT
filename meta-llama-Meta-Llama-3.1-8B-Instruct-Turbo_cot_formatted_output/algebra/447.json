    "solution": "Factoring the right side, we can see that $(x-3)(x+3) = 21(x-3)$. Simplifying, we have $(x-3)(x+3) - 21(x-3) = (x-3)(x-18),$ and therefore our $p$ and $q$ are 18 and 3. Therefore, $p - q = \\boxed{15}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the solutions to the equation, we'll start by simplifying and rearranging the given equation.\n\nGiven equation: $(x-3)(x+3) = 21x - 63$\n\nExpanding the left side: $x^2 - 9 = 21x - 63$\n\nNow, let's rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\n$x^2 - 21x + 54 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form of $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a = 1$, $b = -21$, and $c = 54$.\n\nTo find the solutions to this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nSubstituting the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n\n$x = \\frac{-(-21) \\pm \\sqrt{(-21)^2 - 4(1)(54)}}{2(1)}$\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n$x = \\frac{21 \\pm \\sqrt{441 - 216}}{2}$\n\n$x = \\frac{21 \\pm \\sqrt{225}}{2}$\n\n$x = \\frac{21 \\pm 15}{2}$\n\nNow, we'll consider the two possible solutions for $x$.\n\nSolution 1: $x = \\frac{21 + 15}{2} = \\frac{36}{2} = 18$\n\nSolution 2: $x = \\frac{21 - 15}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$\n\nSince $p$ and $q$ are the two distinct solutions, we have $p = 18$ and $q = 3$.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $p - q$.\n\n$p - q = 18 - 3 = 15$\n\nTherefore, the value of $p - q$ is $\\boxed{15}$."
