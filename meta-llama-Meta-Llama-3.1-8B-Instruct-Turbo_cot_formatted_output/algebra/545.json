    "solution": "Looking at the graph, we can see the line intersects the y-axis at y=1.  This is the y-intercept, which is equal to the value of $b$.  Now, we need to find the slope of the line.  Looking carefully, we can see that for every one unit to the right the line travels, it goes up by two units.  For example, starting from the y-intercept at $(0,1)$, the line passes through a lattice point one unit over and two units up from there, at $(1,3)$.  The rise over run is then $\\frac{2}{1}$, so the slope is 2.  The equation of this line is $y=2x+1$.  Therefore, $mb=2(1)=\\boxed{2}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the equation of the line, we need to find the slope $m$ and the y-intercept $b$.\n\nStep 1: Find the y-intercept $b$.  \nThe y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. From the graph, we can see that the line crosses the y-axis at $y=1$. So, the y-intercept $b$ is $1$.\n\nStep 2: Find the slope $m$.  \nThe slope of a line is the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change. We can find the vertical change by finding the difference between the y-coordinates of two points on the line. We can find the horizontal change by finding the difference between the x-coordinates of the same two points.\n\nLet's find the vertical change. We can see that the line passes through the points $(2,5)$ and $(-3,-5)$. The vertical change is $5-(-5)=10$.\n\nNow, let's find the horizontal change. The horizontal change is $2-(-3)=5$.\n\nThe slope $m$ is the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change, which is $\\frac{10}{5}=2$.\n\nStep 3: Find $mb$.  \nNow that we have found the values of $m$ and $b$, we can find the value of $mb$.\n\n$mb = 2(1)$\n$mb = 2$\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{2}$."
