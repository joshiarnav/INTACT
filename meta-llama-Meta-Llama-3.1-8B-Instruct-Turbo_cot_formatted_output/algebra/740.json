    "problem": "Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles. If it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles, using the same rates, how many minutes would it take Jordan to run 5 miles?",
    "solution": "Since Steve's 3-mile time is 24 minutes, Jordan ran 2 miles in $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot24=12$ minutes.  Therefore, each mile takes Jordan 6 minutes to run, so he would take $6\\cdot5=\\boxed{30}$ minutes to run five miles.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. First, let's determine how long it took Jordan to run 2 miles. We know it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles. Since Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles, we can calculate the time it took Jordan to run 2 miles as follows:\n\nTime taken by Steve to run 3 miles = 24 minutes\nTime taken by Jordan to run 2 miles = 24 / 2 = 12 minutes\n\n2. Now that we have the time taken by Jordan to run 2 miles, we can calculate his speed (in miles per minute) by dividing the distance he ran (2 miles) by the time taken (12 minutes):\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 12 minutes = 1/6 miles per minute\n\n3. Now that we know Jordan's speed, we can calculate the time it would take him to run 5 miles using the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 5 miles / (1/6 miles per minute)\nTime = 5 * 6 minutes\nTime = 30 minutes\n\nTherefore, it would take Jordan 30 minutes to run 5 miles.\n\n$\\boxed{30}$"
