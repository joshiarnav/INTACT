    "problem": "The product of two positive integers plus their sum is 103. The integers are relatively prime, and each is less than 20. What is the sum of the two integers?",
    "solution": "Let our numbers be $a$ and $b$ with $a>b.$ Then $ab+a+b=103$. With Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick in mind, we add $1$ to both sides and get $ab+a+b+1 = 104$, which factors as $(a+1)(b+1)=104$. We consider pairs $(a+1, b+1)$ of factors of $104$: $(104,1), (52,2), (26,4), (13,8)$. Since $a<20$, we can rule out the first 3 pairs, which gives $a=12$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\\boxed{19}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nGiven that the product of two positive integers plus their sum is 103, we can write the equation as:\n\nab + a + b = 103\n\nWe are also given that the integers are relatively prime, which means they have no common factors other than 1 and that any two integers are coprime.\n\nNow, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick to rewrite the equation:\n\nab + a + b + 1 = 103 + 1\n(ab + a + b + 1) = (a + 1)(b + 1) = 104\n(ab + a + b + 1) = (a + 1)(b + 1) = 2^4 * 13\n\nSince a and b are both positive integers, a + 1 and b + 1 are also positive integers.\n\nTherefore, we can list the factor pairs of 104 + 1 (which is 105), which are:\n\n1 x 105 + 1 x 1\n3 x 35 + 1 x 1\n7 x 15 + 1 x 1\n5 x 21 + 1 x 1\n21 x 5 + 1 x 1\n15 x 7 + 1 x 1\n35 x 3 + 1 x 1\n105 x 1 + 1 x 1\n1 x 1 + 105 x 1\n\nSo, the possible values of (a + 1, b + 1) are (1, 105), (3, 35), (7, 15), and (5, 21).\n\nSince a and b are each less than 20, we can rule out the cases where a + 1 is greater than 20. This leaves us with the possible values of (a, b) as (2, 14), (4, 34), (6, 14), and (4, 20).\n\nHowever, since a and b are relatively prime, (4, 34) is not a valid solution since 4 and 34 share a common factor of 2.\n\nTherefore, the remaining possible values of (a, b) are (2, 14) and (4, 34), but we must eliminate (4, 34) because 4 and 34 share a common factor of 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct value of (a, b) is (2, 14) and (6, 14), and the sum of (a, b) for each pair is 16. \n\nSo, the sum of the two integers is $\\boxed{16}$."
