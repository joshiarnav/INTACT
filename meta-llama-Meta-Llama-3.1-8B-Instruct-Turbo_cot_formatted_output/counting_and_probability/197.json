    "problem": "A pirate is searching for buried treasure on 6 islands. On each island, there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that the island has buried treasure and no traps, a $\\frac{1}{12}$ chance that the island has traps but no treasure, and a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance that the island has neither traps nor treasure. What is the probability that while searching all 6 islands, the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure, and none with traps?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose 3 islands. For each of these choices, there is a probability of $\\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3$ that the chosen islands have treasure and the remaining ones have neither treasure nor traps. Therefore, the probability that the pirate encounters exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps is $20 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps while searching all 6 islands, we need to consider the probability of each island having treasure and none with traps, and then calculate the probability of this happening 3 times and the remaining 3 times having neither traps nor treasure.\n\nThe probability that an island has treasure and no traps is $\\frac{1}{4}$, and the probability that an island has neither traps nor treasure is $\\frac{2}{3}$. \n\nWe want to choose 3 islands out of 6 that have treasure (and no traps) and the remaining 3 islands out of 6 that have neither traps nor treasure. The number of ways to choose 3 islands out of 6 is given by the combination formula $\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3! \\times 3!} = 20$.\n\nThe probability of 3 islands having treasure and no traps is $(\\frac{1}{4})^3$, and the probability of the remaining 3 islands having neither traps nor treasure is $(\\frac{2}{3})^3$.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is $\\binom{6}{3} \\times (\\frac{1}{4})^3 \\times (\\frac{2}{3})^3 = 20 \\times \\frac{1}{64} \\times \\frac{8}{27} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$."
