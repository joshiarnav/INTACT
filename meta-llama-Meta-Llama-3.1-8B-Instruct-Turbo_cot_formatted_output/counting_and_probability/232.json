    "solution": "We note that the points for which $x+y<3$ are those that lie below the line $x+y = 3$, or $y= -x + 3$.  As the diagram below illustrates, these are all the points in the square except those in the triangle with vertices (2,1), (2,2), and (1,2).\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(.7);\n\ndraw((-.1,0)--(3,0),Arrow);\ndraw((0,-.1)--(0,4),Arrow);\n\ndraw((0,2)--(2,2)--(2,0));\ndraw((-.5,3.5)--(2.5,.5),dashed,Arrows);\n\nfill((0,0)--(0,2)--(1,2)--(2,1)--(2,0)--cycle,gray(.7));\n\nlabel(\"(1,2)\",(1,2),NE);\nlabel(\"(2,2)\",(2,2),NE);\nlabel(\"(2,1)\",(2,1),NE);\n[/asy]\n\nSince this is a right triangle whose sides both of length 1, its area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1^2 = 1/2$.

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that $x+y < 3$, we first need to understand the region where this condition is satisfied. \n\nThe inequality $x+y < 3$ can be rewritten as $y < -x + 3$. This represents a line with slope -1 and y-intercept 3.\n\nThe square with vertices (0,0), (0,2), (2,2), and (2,0) forms a 2x2 square.\n\nTo visualize the region where $x+y < 3$, we can plot the line $y = -x + 3$ and the square. The region where $x+y < 3$ is satisfied is the area below this line inside the square.\n\nTo find this area, we can first find the area of the square, which is $2^2 = 4$.\n\nThe line $y = -x + 3$ intersects the square at $x=1$, which corresponds to $y=2$. At $x=2$, the line is above the square, so we don't need to consider this point.\n\nSince the line intersects the square at $x=1$, we can see that the region where $x+y < 3$ is satisfied is a triangle with vertices (0,0), (2,1), and (1,2).\n\nThe area of this triangle can be found by using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height.\n\nThe base of this triangle is 2 (from (0,0) to (2,1)), and the height is 1 (from (1,2) to (2,1)). \n\nSo, the area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(2)(1) = 1$.\n\nThe area of the square where $x+y < 3$ is not satisfied is a triangle with vertices (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2).\n\nThis is a right triangle with base 1 and height 1, so its area is $\\frac{1}{2}(1)(1) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSince the area where $x+y < 3$ is satisfied is the area of the square minus the area of this triangle, the area where $x+y < 3$ is satisfied is $4 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}$.\n\nThe probability that $x+y < 3$ is the area where $x+y < 3$ is satisfied divided by the area of the square.\n\nSo, the probability is $\\frac{\\frac{7}{2}}{4} = \\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$."
