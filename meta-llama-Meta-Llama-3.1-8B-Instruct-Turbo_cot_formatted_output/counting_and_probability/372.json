    "solution": "The number of pairs of neighbors for Cara actually has nothing to do with the shape of the table she is sitting at. That is, all that matters is that she has 5 friends and two of them will be her neighbors. There are ${5 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{10}$ pairs of friends that she can thus sit between.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Since the table is circular and there are 5 friends, there are 5 friends to the left of Cara and 4 friends to her right (since she's already in the middle).\n\n2. To find the number of pairs of people Cara can be sitting between, we need to choose 2 people from either the 5 to the left or the 4 to the right. \n\n3. The number of ways to choose 2 people from 5 is given by the combination formula: $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items and $k$ is the number of items to choose. \n\n4. So for the 5 friends to the left, we have $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\n5. Similarly, for the 4 friends to the right, we have $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$.\n\n6. Since these are mutually exclusive events (Cara can't be sitting between two of her friends from the left and two of her friends from the right at the same time), we can add the number of pairs from both sides to find the total number of possible pairs.\n\n7. So the total number of possible pairs is $10 + 6 = 16$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between is $\\boxed{16}$."
