    "problem": "A soccer team has $22$ available players. A fixed set of $11$ players starts the game, while the other $11$ are available as substitutes. During the game, the coach may make as many as $3$ substitutions, where any one of the $11$ players in the game is replaced by one of the substitutes. No player removed from the game may reenter the game, although a substitute entering the game may be replaced later. No two substitutions can happen at the same time. The players involved and the order of the substitutions matter. Let $n$ be the number of ways the coach can make substitutions during the game (including the possibility of making no substitutions). Find the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$.\n",
    "solution": "There are $0-3$ substitutions. The number of ways to sub any number of times must be multiplied by the previous number. This is defined recursively. The case for $0$ subs is $1$, and the ways to reorganize after $n$ subs is the product of the number of new subs ($12-n$) and the players that can be ejected ($11$). The formula for $n$ subs is then $a_n=11(12-n)a_{n-1}$ with $a_0=1$.\nSumming from $0$ to $3$ gives $1+11^2+11^{3}\\cdot 10+11^{4}\\cdot 10\\cdot 9$. Notice that $10+9\\cdot11\\cdot10=10+990=1000$. Then, rearrange it into $1+11^2+11^3\\cdot (10+11\\cdot10\\cdot9)= 1+11^2+11^3\\cdot (1000)$. When taking modulo $1000$, the last term goes away. What is left is $1+11^2=\\boxed{122}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of ways the coach can make substitutions during the game, we can consider the different possible scenarios for the number of substitutions made.\n\n1. **No substitutions**: In this case, the coach makes no substitutions, so there is only $1$ way to do this.\n\n2. **One substitution**: The coach can choose one of the $11$ starting players to be replaced and one of the $11$ substitutes to replace them, so there are $11 \\times 11 = 121$ ways to make one substitution.\n\n3. **Two substitutions**: The coach can choose one of the $11$ starting players to be replaced in $11$ ways, and then choose one of the $11$ substitutes to replace them in $11$ ways.  Then, the coach can choose one of the remaining $10$ starting players to be replaced in $10$ ways, and then choose one of the remaining $10$ substitutes to replace them in $10$ ways, so there are $11 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 12100$ ways to make two substitutions.\n\n4. **Three substitutions**: The coach can choose one of the $11$ starting players to be replaced in $11$ ways, and then choose one of the $11$ substitutes to replace them in $11$ ways.  Then, the coach can choose one of the remaining $10$ starting players to be replaced in $10$ ways, and then choose one of the remaining $10$ substitutes to replace them in $10$ ways.  Finally, the coach can choose one of the remaining $9$ starting players to be replaced in $9$ ways, and then choose one of the remaining $9$ substitutes to replace them in $9$ ways, so there are $11 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 108900$ ways to make three substitutions.\n\nAdding up the number of ways to make the different numbers of substitutions, we get a total of $n = 1 + 121 + 12100 + 108900 = 120122$ ways the coach can make substitutions during the game.\n\nThe remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{122}$"
