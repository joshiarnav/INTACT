    "solution": "Let the two disjoint subsets be $A$ and $B$, and let $C = S-(A+B)$. For each $i \\in S$, either $i \\in A$, $i \\in B$, or $i \\in C$. So there are $3^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ into disjoint $A$, $B$, and $C$.\nHowever, there are $2^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ such that $A = \\emptyset$ and $S = B+C$, and there are $2^{10}$ ways to organize the elements of $S$ such that $B = \\emptyset$ and $S = A+C$. But, the combination such that $A = B = \\emptyset$ and $S = C$ is counted twice.\nThus, there are $3^{10}-2\\cdot2^{10}+1$ ordered pairs of sets $(A,B)$. But since the question asks for the number of unordered sets $\\{ A,B \\}$, $n = \\frac{1}{2}(3^{10}-2\\cdot2^{10}+1) = 28501 \\equiv \\boxed{501} \\pmod{1000}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.\n\nFirst, let's consider the three disjoint subsets we are working with: $A$, $B$, and $S$. $S$ is the original set $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nWe can think of the problem as counting the number of ways to assign elements of $S$ to $A$ or $B$, with the constraint that both $A$ and $B$ must be non-empty.\n\nFor each element $i$ in $S$, there are three possibilities:\n\n- $i$ is in $A$ and not in $B$\n- $i$ is in $B$ and not in $A$\n- $i$ is not in either $A$ or $B$ (this is the case where we choose to leave $i$ out)\n\nHowever, we know that both $A$ and $B$ must be non-empty, so the third case cannot be the only possibility for all elements of $S$. But we can use this as a starting point.\n\nLet's count the number of ways to assign elements of $S$ to $A$, $B$, and the \"neither\" category, with the constraint that both $A$ and $B$ must be non-empty.\n\nFor each element $i$ in $S$, there are three possibilities:\n\n- $i$ is in $A$ and not in $B$\n- $i$ is in $B$ and not in $A$\n- $i$ is not in either $A$ or $B$\n\nSince there are 10 elements in $S$, the total number of ways to assign elements to $A$, $B$, and the \"neither\" category is $3^{10}$.\n\nHowever, this includes cases where either $A$ or $B$ (or both) are empty. We need to subtract these cases.\n\nWe can count the number of ways to assign elements to $A$ and the \"neither\" category, with the constraint that $A$ is non-empty. This is equivalent to choosing a non-empty subset of $S$ and assigning each element to either $A$ or the \"neither\" category. There are $2^{10} - 1$ ways to do this (subtracting 1 because we exclude the case where $A$ is empty).\n\nSimilarly, we can count the number of ways to assign elements to $B$ and the \"neither\" category, with the constraint that $B$ is non-empty. This is equivalent to choosing a non-empty subset of $S$ and assigning each element to either $B$ or the \"neither\" category. There are $2^{10} - 1$ ways to do this.\n\nWe also need to exclude the case where both $A$ and $B$ are empty, which is equivalent to the case where all elements are in the \"neither\" category. There is 1 way to do this.\n\nNow, we need to consider the number of ways to assign elements to $A$ and $B$ once we have chosen the non-empty subsets of $S$ for $A$ and $B$. For each element $i$ in the non-empty subset of $S$ chosen for $A$, there are two possibilities:\n\n- $i$ is in $A$ and not in $B$\n- $i$ is not in $A$ but in $B$\n\nSimilarly, for each element $i$ in the non-empty subset of $S$ chosen for $B$, there are two possibilities:\n\n- $i$ is in $B$ and not in $A$\n- $i$ is not in $B$ but in $A$\n\nSince there are $2^{10} - 1$ ways to choose the non-empty subsets of $S$ for $A$ and $B$, and for each of these choices there are $2^{10-1}$ ways to assign elements to $A$ and $B$, the total number of ways to assign elements to $A$, $B$, and the \"neither\" category, with the constraint that both $A$ and $B$ must be non-empty, is\n\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{9} (2^k)(2^{10-k}) = \\sum_{k=1}^{9} 2^{10} = 9(2^{10}) = 9 \\cdot 1024 = 9216$$\n\nWe also need to add the case where $A$ and $B$ are non-empty but the \"neither\" category is empty, which we counted in the $2^{10} - 1$ ways to choose the non-empty subsets of $S$ for $A$ and $B$, and for each of these choices there are $2^{10-1}$ ways to assign elements to $A$ and $B$. However, we have counted this case twice, so we need to subtract it once.\n\nSince there are $2^{10} - 1$ ways to choose the non-empty subsets of $S$ for $A$ and $B$, and for each of these choices there are $2^{10-1}$ ways to assign elements to $A$ and $B$, the total number of ways to assign elements to $A$, $B$, and the \"neither\" category, with the constraint that both $A$ and $B$ must be non-empty, is\n\n$$ 9(2^{10}) - (2^{10} - 1)(2^{10-1}) = 9(2^{10}) - (2^{10} - 1)(2^9) = 9(2^{10}) - (2^{19} - 2^9) = 9(2^{10}) - 2^{19} + 2^9 = 9(2^{10}) - 2^{19} + 2^9 = 9216 - 524288 + 512 = 9216 - 524288 + 512 =  -513440 + 9216 + 512 = -513440 + 9728 = - 513440 + 9728 =  - 503712$$\n$$ n =  503712$$\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{712}$"
