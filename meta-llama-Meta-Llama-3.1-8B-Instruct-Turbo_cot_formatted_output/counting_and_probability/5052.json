They fall into three categories: there are those which are entirely contained within a single face of the cube (whose sides are two edges and one face diagonal), those which lie in a plane perpendicular to one face of the cube (whose sides are one edge, one face diagonal and one space diagonal of the cube) and those which lie in a plane oblique to the edges of the cube, whose sides are three face diagonals of the cube.\nEach face of the cube contains ${4\\choose 3} = 4$ triangles of the first type, and there are $6$ faces, so there are $24$ triangles of the first type. Each of these is a right triangle with legs of length $1$, so each triangle of the first type has area $\\frac 12$.\nEach edge of the cube is a side of exactly $2$ of the triangles of the second type, and there are $12$ edges, so there are $24$ triangles of the second type. Each of these is a right triangle with legs of length $1$ and $\\sqrt 2$, so each triangle of the second type has area $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nEach vertex of the cube is associated with exactly one triangle of the third type (whose vertices are its three neighbors), and there are $8$ vertices of the cube, so there are $8$ triangles of the third type. Each of the these is an equilateral triangle with sides of length $\\sqrt 2$, so each triangle of the third type has area $\\frac{\\sqrt 3}2$.\nThus the total area of all these triangles is $24 \\cdot \\frac12 + 24\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt2}2 + 8\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt3}2 = 12 + 12\\sqrt2 + 4\\sqrt3 = 12 + \\sqrt{288} + \\sqrt{48}$ and the answer is $12 + 288 + 48 = \\boxed{348}$.",

Each of these triangles has an area of $\\frac12$.\n\nSo, the total area contributed by these triangles is $24 \\cdot 4 \\cdot \\frac12 = 48$.\n\n2. **Triangles lying in a plane perpendicular to one face of the cube:** There are $24$ faces on the cube, and for each face, there are ${4\\choose 3} = 4$ edges, and for each edge, there are ${2\\choose 2} = 1$ triangles of the second type. Each of these triangles has an area of $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, but there are $\\frac{4}{2}=2$ pairs of these triangles that make up a rectangle of area $1$, so they together contribute $\\sqrt{2}$ to the area.\n\nSo, the total area contributed by these triangles is $24 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - 24\\cdot 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 24\\sqrt{2}(1-\\frac{1}{2}) = 12\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n3. **Triangles lying in a plane oblique to the edges of the cube:** There are ${8\\choose 3} = 56$ triangles of the third type, and each of them has an area of $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nSo, the total area contributed by these triangles is $56 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 28\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the total area is $48 + 12\\sqrt{2} + 28\\sqrt{3}$, which implies that the sum of the areas of all triangles whose vertices are also vertices of a $1$ by $1$ by $1$ cube is $m + \\sqrt{n} + \\sqrt{p} = 48 + 12\\sqrt{2} + 28\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThen, $m + n + p = 48 + 2\\cdot 12 + 3\\cdot 28 = \\boxed{144}$."
