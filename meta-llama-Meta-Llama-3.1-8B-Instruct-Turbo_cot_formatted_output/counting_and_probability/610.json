    "problem": "Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards (13 hearts, 13 clubs, 13 spades, and 13 diamonds).  What is the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen?",
    "solution": "The probability that the first card is a 6 is $\\dfrac{1}{13}$.  There are then 51 cards remaining, so the probability the second card is a Queen is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  The answer is then $\\dfrac{1}{13} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{663}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen, we need to break it down into two steps:\n\n1. **First card is a 6**: There are 4 sixes in a standard deck of 52 cards (one in each suit). So, the probability of drawing a 6 as the first card is:\n\nNumber of 6s / Total number of cards = 4/52 = 1/13\n\n2. **Second card is a Queen**: Assuming the first card is a 6, there are now 51 cards left in the deck (since one card has been removed). There are 4 Queens in the deck. So, the probability of drawing a Queen as the second card is:\n\nNumber of Queens / Total number of remaining cards = 4/51\n\nSince the two events are dependent (drawing the second card depends on the first card being a 6), we multiply the probabilities of each event to get the overall probability:\n\n(Probability of first card being a 6) * (Probability of second card being a Queen) = (1/13) * (1/51) = 1/663\n\nTherefore, the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{663}}$"
