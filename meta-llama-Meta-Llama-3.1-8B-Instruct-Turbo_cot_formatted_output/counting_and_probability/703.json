    "model_solution": "To find the number of ways George can choose two out of seven colors to paint his room, we need to use the concept of combinations.\n\nCombinations are used when the order of selection doesn't matter. In this case, it doesn't matter which color George chooses first or second.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nnCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nWhere:\n- n is the total number of items (in this case, colors)\n- r is the number of items to choose (in this case, 2 colors)\n- n! is the factorial of n (the product of all positive integers up to n)\n- r! is the factorial of r (the product of all positive integers up to r)\n- (n-r)! is the factorial of the difference between n and r\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n7C2 = 7! / (2!(7-2)!)\n= 7! / (2!5!)\n= (7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / ((2 \u00d7 1)(5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1))\n= (7 \u00d7 6) / (2 \u00d7 1)\n= 21\n\nSo, the number of ways George can choose two out of seven colors to paint his room is $\\boxed{21}$."
