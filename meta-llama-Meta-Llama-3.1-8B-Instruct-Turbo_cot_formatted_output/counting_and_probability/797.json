    "problem": "A math conference is presenting a lecture series with six different lecturers. If Dr. Smith's lecture depends on Dr. Jones's lecture, so that Dr. Smith must be scheduled at some time after Dr. Jones, in how many orders can the six lecturers be scheduled?",
    "solution": "There are a total of $6!$ ways to order the 6 lectures with no restriction. By symmetry, exactly half of these will have Dr. Jones's lecture before Dr. Smith's lecture. Thus there are $6!/2 = \\boxed{360}$ ways to schedule the conference.",

    "file_name": "./MATH_subsample_uniform/counting_and_probability/797.json",
    "model_solution": "To find the total number of ways to schedule the six lecturers, we will first find the total number of permutations and then divide by 2, since Dr. Smith must be scheduled at some time after Dr. Jones.\n\nStep 1: Total number of permutations\nThere are 6 lecturers, and they can be scheduled in 6! = 720 ways.\n\nStep 2: Divide by 2, since Dr. Smith must be scheduled at some time after Dr. Jones\nFor every permutation where Dr. Smith is scheduled before Dr. Jones, there is a corresponding permutation where Dr. Jones is scheduled before Dr. Smith. So, we divide the total number of permutations by 2.\n\nTotal number of ways to schedule the 6 lecturers = 720 / 2 = 360\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{360}$."
