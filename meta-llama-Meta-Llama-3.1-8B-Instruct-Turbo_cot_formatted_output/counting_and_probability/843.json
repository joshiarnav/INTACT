    "problem": "A bag contains 3 tan, 2 pink and 4 violet chips. If the 9 chips are randomly drawn from the bag, one at a time and without replacement, what is the probability that the chips are drawn in such a way that the 3 tan chips are drawn consecutively, the 2 pink chips are drawn consecutively, and the 4 violet chips are drawn consecutively, but not necessarily in the tan-pink-violet order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We count the number of ways to draw the tan chips consecutively, the pink chips consecutively, and the violet chips consecutively (although not necessarily in that order).  First of all, we can draw the tan chips in $3!$ ways, the pink chips in $2!$ ways, and the violet chips in $4!$ ways.  We can choose our drawing order (e.g pink-tan-violet) in $3!$ ways.  Thus we have $3!2!4!3!$ satisfying arrangements and $9!$ total ways of drawing the chips.  So our answer is $\\frac{3!2!4!3!}{9!} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{210}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability that the chips are drawn in such a way that the 3 tan chips are drawn consecutively, the 2 pink chips are drawn consecutively, and the 4 violet chips are drawn consecutively, we can consider the total number of ways to draw the chips and the number of ways to draw them in the desired manner.\n\nThere are 3 groups of consecutive chips (tan, pink, and violet) and these can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. \n\nFor each arrangement of the groups, the tan chips can be arranged in 3! ways, the pink chips in 2! ways, and the violet chips in 4! ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to draw the chips in the desired manner is 6 * 3! * 2! * 4!.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw the 9 chips without replacement is 9!.\n\nSo, the probability is given by:\n\n(6 * 3! * 2! * 4!) / 9!\n\n= (6 * 6 * 2 * 24) / (362,880)\n\n= (1728) / (362,880)\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 144.\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\n(1728 / 144) / (362,880 / 144)\n\n= 12 / 2520\n\nWe can simplify this further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12.\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\n(12 / 12) / (2520 / 12)\n\n= 1 / 210\n\nTherefore, the probability that the chips are drawn in such a way that the 3 tan chips are drawn consecutively, the 2 pink chips are drawn consecutively, and the 4 violet chips are drawn consecutively is 1/210.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{210}}$."
