    "solution": "The hexagons in the second column to the left must be yellow and green, but either color can be on top: 2 possibilities. With either possibility, the rest of the figure is easily colored in, with the color of every other hexagon being forced.  (ex. In the third column, the middle hexagon must be red, and the top and bottom must be the opposite of the top and bottom in the second column)  Thus, there are only $\\boxed{2}$ possibilities.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we can work our way from left to right and top to bottom, determining the color of each hexagon based on the colors of the hexagons surrounding it. \n\nSince the hexagon with the R is colored red, the two hexagons adjacent to it on the left (at the top and bottom) must be colored yellow and green, in either order. \n\nNow let's consider the next hexagon to the right of the top yellow hexagon.  If we color this hexagon red, then the hexagon below it must be green (since the hexagon above it is yellow).  But this would mean that the hexagon below the red hexagon is the same color as the hexagon to its left, so this would not be a valid coloring. \n\nOn the other hand, if we color this hexagon yellow, then the hexagon below it must be red.  But this would mean that the hexagon below the red hexagon is the same color as the hexagon to its right, so this would not be a valid coloring either.\n\nSo we must color this hexagon green.  Then the hexagon to its left must be red, and the hexagon to its right must be yellow.  This determines the colors of the next few hexagons to the right.\n\nNow we can continue this process, determining the color of each hexagon based on the colors of the hexagons surrounding it. \n\nAfter working our way to the right, we can then work our way down, determining the color of the remaining hexagons.\n\nBased on this process, we find that there are only two possible ways to color the figure:\n\n$\\boxed{2}$"
