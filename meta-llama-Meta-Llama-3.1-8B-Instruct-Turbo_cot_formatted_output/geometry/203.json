    "problem": "A circle centered at $O$ is circumscribed about $\\triangle ABC$ as follows: [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pO;\npO = (0, 0);\npA = pO + dir(-20);\npB = pO + dir(90);\npC = pO + dir(190);\ndraw(pA--pB--pC--pA);\ndraw(pO--pA);\ndraw(pO--pB);\ndraw(pO--pC);\nlabel(\"$O$\", pO, S);\nlabel(\"$110^\\circ$\", pO, NE);\nlabel(\"$100^\\circ$\", pO, NW);\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, SE);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, N);\nlabel(\"$C$\", pC, SW);\ndraw(circle(pO, 1));\n[/asy] What is the measure of $\\angle BAC$, in degrees?",
    "solution": "We can see that $\\angle AOC = 360^\\circ - (110^\\circ + 100^\\circ) = 150^\\circ.$ Now, $\\triangle AOC$ and $\\triangle AOB$ are both isosceles triangles. That means that $\\angle OAC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (180^\\circ - 150^\\circ) = 15^\\circ$ and $\\angle OAB = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (180^\\circ - 110^\\circ) = 35^\\circ.$  Therefore, our answer is $\\angle BAC = \\angle OAB + \\angle OAC = 15^\\circ + 35^\\circ = \\boxed{50^\\circ}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the measure of angle BAC, we can use the properties of the circle and angles. \n\nStep 1:  We are given that a circle is circumscribed about triangle ABC, and we need to find the measure of \u2220BAC.\nStep 2:  The angles at the center of the circle, \u2220AOB, \u2220BOC, and \u2220COA, are related to the angles at the circumference by the inscribed angle theorem.\nStep 3:  According to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of an angle inscribed in a circle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\nStep 4:  In this case, \u2220BAC is inscribed in the circle and intercepts the arc AC. So, we have \u2220BAC = 1/2 (arc AC).\nStep 5:  Now, we know that the measure of arc AC is the difference between the measures of \u2220AOB and \u2220BOC. \nStep 6:  We are given that \u2220AOB = 110\u00b0 and \u2220BOC = 100\u00b0. \nStep 7:  So, the measure of arc AC = \u2220AOB - \u2220BOC = 110\u00b0 - 100\u00b0 = 10\u00b0.\nStep 8:  Since \u2220BAC is half the measure of arc AC, we have \u2220BAC = 1/2 (arc AC) = 1/2 (10\u00b0) = 5\u00b0.\nStep 9:  However, it seems that we may have made an error in our assumption that arc AC = 10\u00b0 because the sum of angles AOB and BOC does not have to be the arc AC. The arc AC = 360 - angle AOC which is 360 - 100 = 260. \nStep 10:  Since the measure of arc AC = 260\u00b0, we have \u2220BAC = 1/2 (arc AC) = 1/2 (260\u00b0) = 130\u00b0.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the measure of \u2220BAC is 130\u00b0.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{130}$"
