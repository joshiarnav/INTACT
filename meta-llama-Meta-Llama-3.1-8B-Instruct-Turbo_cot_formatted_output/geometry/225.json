    "problem": "Jimmy owns a cube-shaped container that measures $10$ inches on each side. He fills this container with water until it is half full. Then he throws ten giant ice cubes that measure $2$ inches on each side into the container. In inches cubed, how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water?",
    "solution": "First let's compute the volume of the container. The container measures $10\\times10\\times10$ so its volume is  $$10\\cdot10\\cdot10=10^3=1000$$inches cubed. Since the container is only half full, there are $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10^3=500$$inches cubed of water in it. Additionally, there are ten ice cubes each with a volume of $2^3$. This means that the total volume of the ice cubes is $$10\\cdot2^3=10\\cdot8=80.$$Altogether, the water and the ice cubes occupy $500+80=580$ inches cubed. This means that there are $1000-580=\\boxed{420}$ inches cubed of space in the container unoccupied by water and ice.",

    "model_solution": "To find out how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water, we first need to calculate the volume of the container, the volume of water, and the volume of ice.\n\n1. **Volume of the container**: The container is a cube with a side length of $10$ inches. The volume of a cube is given as $side^3$. So, the volume of the container is $10^3 = 1000$ cubic inches.\n\n2. **Volume of water**: The container is half full of water, so the volume of water is half the volume of the container. Volume of water = $\\frac{1}{2} * 1000$ cubic inches = $500$ cubic inches.\n\n3. **Volume of ice**: Each ice cube is a cube with a side length of $2$ inches. The volume of one ice cube is $2^3 = 8$ cubic inches. Since there are ten ice cubes, the total volume of ice is $10 * 8$ cubic inches = $80$ cubic inches.\n\n4. **Total occupied volume**: The total occupied volume is the sum of the volume of water and the volume of ice. Total occupied volume = $500 + 80$ cubic inches = $580$ cubic inches.\n\n5. **Unoccupied volume**: To find the unoccupied volume, we subtract the total occupied volume from the volume of the container. Unoccupied volume = $1000 - 580$ cubic inches = $420$ cubic inches.\n\nTherefore, the amount of the container unoccupied by ice or water is $\\boxed{420}$ cubic inches."
