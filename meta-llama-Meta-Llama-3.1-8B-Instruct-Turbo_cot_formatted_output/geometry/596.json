    "problem": "Point $P$ is inside equilateral $\\triangle ABC$.  Points $Q$, $R$, and $S$ are the feet of the perpendiculars from $P$ to $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{CA}$, respectively. Given that $PQ=1$, $PR=2$, and $PS=3$, what is $AB$ in terms of radicals?",
    "solution": "Let the side length of $\\triangle ABC$ be $s$. Then the areas of $\\triangle APB$, $\\triangle BPC$, and $\\triangle CPA$ are, respectively, $s/2$, $s$, and $3s/2$.  The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is the sum of these, which is $3s$.  The area of $\\triangle ABC$ may also be expressed as $(\\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$, so $3s = (\\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$. The unique positive solution for $s$ is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's start by considering the properties of an equilateral triangle and the perpendiculars drawn from point P.\n\nSince $\\triangle ABC$ is an equilateral triangle, all of its sides are equal. Let's denote the length of each side as $s$. \n\nNow, let's consider the area of $\\triangle ABC$. The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: \n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nSince the height of each triangle $\\triangle ABP$, $\\triangle BCP$, and $\\triangle CAP$ is the perpendicular dropped from point P to each side (PQ, PR, and PS, respectively), we can calculate the area of $\\triangle ABC$ using the heights and the base of each of these smaller triangles.\n\nThe area of $\\triangle ABC$ can also be calculated as the sum of the areas of the three smaller triangles:\n\nArea of $\\triangle ABC$ = Area of $\\triangle ABP$ + Area of $\\triangle BCP$ + Area of $\\triangle CAP$\n\nNow, let's calculate the area of each smaller triangle:\n\nArea of $\\triangle ABP$ = (PQ * AB) / 2\n= ($s$ * 1) / 2\n= $s$ / 2\n\nArea of $\\triangle BCP$ = (PR * BC) / 2\n= ($s$ * 2) / 2\n= $s$\n\nArea of $\\triangle CAP$ = (PS * CA) / 2\n= ($s$ * 3) / 2\n= (3 * $s$) / 2\n\nNow, let's equate the two expressions for the area of $\\triangle ABC$:\n\n$s$ / 2 + $s$ + (3 * $s$) / 2 = (1/2) * $s$ * $s$ * sin(60\u00b0)\n\nSimplifying the left-hand side of the equation:\n\n(5 * $s$) / 2 = (1/2) * $s$ * $s$ * sin(60\u00b0)\n\nNow, let's simplify the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n(5 * $s$) / 2 = (1/2) * $s$ * $s$ * (\u221a3 / 2)\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fractions:\n\n5 * $s$ = $s$ * $s$ * (\u221a3 / 2)\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n10 * $s$ = $s$ * $s$ * \u221a3\n\nNow, dividing both sides of the equation by $s$:\n\n10 = $s$ * \u221a3\n\nNow, dividing both sides of the equation by \u221a3:\n\n$s$ = 10 / \u221a3\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply both the numerator and denominator by \u221a3:\n\n$s$ = (10 * \u221a3) / (\u221a3 * \u221a3)\n= (10 * \u221a3) / 3\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{10\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$."
