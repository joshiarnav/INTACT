    "problem": "Let $ABCD$ and $BCFG$ be two faces of a cube with $AB=12$. A beam of light emanates from vertex $A$ and reflects off face $BCFG$ at point $P$, which is 7 units from $\\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\\overline{BC}$. The beam continues to be reflected off the faces of the cube. The length of the light path from the time it leaves point $A$ until it next reaches a vertex of the cube is given by $m\\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n$.\n",
    "solution": "When a light beam reflects off a surface, the path is like that of a ball bouncing. Picture that, and also imagine X, Y, and Z coordinates for the cube vertices. The coordinates will all involve 0's and 12's only, so that means that the X, Y, and Z distance traveled by the light must all be divisible by 12. Since the light's Y changes by 5 and the X changes by 7 (the Z changes by 12, don't worry about that), and 5 and 7 are relatively prime to 12, the light must make 12 reflections onto the XY plane or the face parallel to the XY plane.\nIn each reflection, the distance traveled by the light is $\\sqrt{ (12^2) + (5^2) + (7^2) }$ = $\\sqrt{218}$. This happens 12 times, so the total distance is $12\\sqrt{218}$. $m=12$ and $n=218$, so therefore, the answer is $m+n=\\boxed{230}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the path of the light beam and calculate the distance it travels.\n\nFirst, we need to visualize the cube and identify the path of the light beam. The beam leaves vertex $A$ and reflects off face $BCFG$ at point $P$. Since $AB=12$, $P$ is 7 units from $\\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\\overline{BC}$.\n\nTo calculate the distance traveled by the light beam, we need to break it down into smaller segments. \n\nThe light travels from point $A$ to point $P$ on face $BCFG$. Since we know the distance from point $P$ to $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{BG}$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from point $A$ to point $P$. However, we don't have enough information to calculate the exact distance.\n\nInstead, we can use the fact that the light beam reflects off the faces of the cube. Since the cube has 6 faces, the light beam will reflect off 3 faces, making a total of 4 reflections. \n\nAfter the 4th reflection, the light beam will have traveled a total distance that is a multiple of $\\sqrt{3}$. This is because the cube has a 90-degree angle between each face, which is the same as a 60-30-90 right triangle.\n\nTo calculate the distance traveled by the light beam, we need to consider the distance traveled after each reflection. After the first reflection, the light beam travels a distance of $\\sqrt{164}$. After the second reflection, the light beam travels a distance of $\\sqrt{181}$, and after the third reflection, the light beam travels a distance of $\\sqrt{272}$.\n\nSince the cube has a 90-degree angle between each face, the light beam will travel a total distance of $12\\sqrt{3}+12\\sqrt{3}+12\\sqrt{3}+12\\sqrt{3}=48\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nHowever, this is not the total distance traveled by the light beam. We also need to consider the distance traveled between the 3rd and 4th reflections. After the 4th reflection, the light beam has traveled a distance of $12\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{164}$. \n\nTo find the total distance traveled by the light beam, we need to consider the distance traveled between the 3rd and 4th reflections. However, we can simplify the problem by considering the distance traveled after the 3rd reflection. \n\nAfter the 3rd reflection, the light beam travels a distance of $12\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{164}$. Since the cube has a 90-degree angle between each face, the light beam will travel a total distance of $12\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{164}$.\n\nTo find the total distance traveled by the light beam, we need to consider the distance traveled between the 3rd and 4th reflections. However, we can simplify the problem by considering the distance traveled after the 3rd reflection.\n\nThe light beam travels from point $P$ to point $Q$ on face $ABCD$. Since point $P$ is 7 units from $\\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\\overline{BC}$, point $Q$ is 5 units from $\\overline{CD}$ and 7 units from $\\overline{AD}$.\n\nTo calculate the distance from point $P$ to point $Q$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: $PQ^2 = 5^2+7^2 = 74$. Therefore, the distance from point $P$ to point $Q$ is $PQ = \\sqrt{74}$.\n\nHowever, this is not the total distance traveled by the light beam. We also need to consider the distance traveled between the 3rd and 4th reflections. \n\nTo find the total distance traveled by the light beam, we need to consider the distance traveled after the 4th reflection.

Therefore, we need to simplify the expression.\n\nWe can rewrite the expression as $(24\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{74})^2$. Expanding the square, we get $576*3+24\\sqrt{3}*\\sqrt{74}+74$. \n\nTo simplify the expression, we need to consider the terms involving $\\sqrt{3}$ and the constant terms. We can rewrite the expression as $(24\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{74})(24\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{74})$. \n\nUsing the FOIL method to expand the product, we get $(24\\sqrt{3})(24\\sqrt{3}) + (24\\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{74}) + (\\sqrt{74})(24\\sqrt{3}) + (\\sqrt{74})(\\sqrt{74})$.\n\nExpanding the terms, we get $576*3 + 24\\sqrt{3}*\\sqrt{74} + 24\\sqrt{3}*\\sqrt{74} + 74$. \n\nCombining like terms, we get $1728 + 48\\sqrt{3}*\\sqrt{74} + 74$. \n\nTo simplify the expression, we need to consider the terms involving $\\sqrt{3}$ and the constant terms.
