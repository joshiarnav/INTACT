    "problem": "Convex pentagon $ABCDE$ has side lengths $AB=5$, $BC=CD=DE=6$, and $EA=7$. Moreover, the pentagon has an inscribed circle (a circle tangent to each side of the pentagon). Find the area of $ABCDE$.\n",
    "solution": "Assume the incircle touches $AB$, $BC$, $CD$, $DE$, $EA$ at $P,Q,R,S,T$ respectively. Then let $PB=x=BQ=RD=SD$, $ET=y=ES=CR=CQ$, $AP=AT=z$. So we have $x+y=6$, $x+z=5$ and $y+z$=7, solve it we have $x=2$, $z=3$, $y=4$. Let the center of the incircle be $I$, by SAS we can proof triangle $BIQ$ is congruent to triangle $DIS$, and triangle $CIR$ is congruent to triangle $SIE$. Then we have $\\angle AED=\\angle BCD$, $\\angle ABC=\\angle CDE$. Extend $CD$, cross ray $AB$ at $M$, ray $AE$ at $N$, then by AAS we have triangle $END$ is congruent to triangle $BMC$. Thus $\\angle M=\\angle N$. Let $EN=MC=a$, then $BM=DN=a+2$. So by law of cosine in triangle $END$ and triangle $ANM$ we can obtain\\[\\frac{2a+8}{2(a+7)}=\\cos N=\\frac{a^2+(a+2)^2-36}{2a(a+2)}\\], solved it gives us $a=8$, which yield triangle $ANM$ to be a triangle with side length 15, 15, 24, draw a height from $A$ to $NM$ divides it into two triangles with side lengths 9, 12, 15, so the area of triangle $ANM$ is 108. Triangle $END$ is a triangle with side lengths 6, 8, 10, so the area of two of them is 48, so the area of pentagon is $108-48=\\boxed{60}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the convex pentagon $ABCDE$, we can use the formula for the area of a polygon given its side lengths and the radius of its inscribed circle.\n\nStep 1: We need to find the radius $r$ of the inscribed circle.\n\nFor a convex pentagon with side lengths $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, and $e$, and semiperimeter $s$, the radius $r$ of the inscribed circle can be found using the formula:\n\n$$r=\\frac{A}{s}$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the area of the pentagon. However, we don't know the area yet, so we'll have to find another way to find the radius.\n\nStep 2: Let's use the fact that the pentagon has an inscribed circle. This means that the distance from the center of the circle to each side of the pentagon is equal to the radius of the circle.\n\nWe can use the fact that the area of the pentagon is equal to the sum of the areas of five triangles formed by the sides of the pentagon and the radii of the inscribed circle.\n\nStep 3: The area of each triangle can be expressed as $\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base of the triangle and $h$ is the height of the triangle. In this case, the base of each triangle is a side of the pentagon, and the height is the radius of the inscribed circle.\n\nThe area of the first triangle (with base $AB=5$) is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 5 \\cdot r = \\frac{5}{2}r$.\n\nThe area of the second triangle (with base $BC=6$) is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot r = 3r$.\n\nThe area of the third triangle (with base $CD=6$) is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot r = 3r$.\n\nThe area of the fourth triangle (with base $DE=6$) is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot r = 3r$.\n\nThe area of the fifth triangle (with base $EA=7$) is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 7 \\cdot r = \\frac{7}{2}r$.\n\nStep 4: The area of the pentagon is the sum of the areas of these five triangles:\n\n$$A=\\frac{5}{2}r+3r+3r+3r+\\frac{7}{2}r=\\frac{5}{2}r+12r+\\frac{7}{2}r$$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$$A=\\frac{5}{2}r+\\frac{7}{2}r+12r$$\n\n$$A=\\frac{12}{2}r+\\frac{14}{2}r+\\frac{24}{2}r$$\n\n$$A=\\frac{50}{2}r$$\n\n$$A=25r$$\n\nStep 5: Now we can use the semiperimeter $s$ of the pentagon to find the radius $r$. The semiperimeter is half the perimeter of the pentagon.\n\nThe perimeter of the pentagon is the sum of its side lengths:\n\n$$P=AB+BC+CD+DE+EA=5+6+6+6+7$$\n\n$$P=30$$\n\nThe semiperimeter is half the perimeter:\n\n$$s=\\frac{P}{2}=\\frac{30}{2}=15$$\n\nNow we can use the formula $r=\\frac{A}{s}$ to find the radius $r$:\n\n$$r=\\frac{A}{s}=\\frac{25r}{15}$$\n\n$$r=\\frac{5}{3}r$$\n\nDivide both sides by $\\frac{5}{3}$:\n\n$$r=\\frac{3}{5}r \\times \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{5}}$$\n\n$$r=\\frac{3}{5}r \\times \\frac{5}{3}$$\n\n$$r=r$$\n\nThis means that we can use the formula $r=\\frac{A}{s}$ to find the radius $r$ if we can find the area $A$ of the pentagon.\n\nStep 6: However, we still need to find the area $A$ of the pentagon. We can use the fact that the area of the pentagon is equal to the sum of the areas of five triangles formed by the sides of the pentagon and the radii of the inscribed circle.\n\nThe area of each triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base of the triangle and $h$ is the height of the triangle. In this case, the base of each triangle is a side of the pentagon, and the height is the radius of the inscribed circle.\n\nThe area of the first triangle (with base $AB=5$) is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 5 \\cdot r = \\frac{5}{2}r$.\n\nThe area of the second triangle (with base $BC=6$) is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot r = 3r$.\n\nThe area of the third triangle (with base $CD=6$) is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot r = 3r$.\n\nThe area of the fourth triangle (with base $DE=6$) is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot r = 3r$.\n\nThe area of the fifth triangle (with base $EA=7$) is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 7 \\cdot r = \\frac{7}{2}r$.\n\nThe area of the pentagon is the sum of the areas of these five triangles:\n\n$$A=\\frac{5}{2}r+3r+3r+3r+\\frac{7}{2}r$$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$$A=\\frac{5}{2}r+\\frac{7}{2}r+12r$$\n\n$$A=\\frac{12}{2}r+\\frac{14}{2}r+\\frac{24}{2}r$$\n\n$$A=\\frac{50}{2}r$$\n\n$$A=25r$$\n\nHowever, we still need to find the value of $r$.\n\nStep 7: To find the value of $r$, let's use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the radii of the inscribed circle to the sides of the pentagon is equal to the semiperimeter of the pentagon.\n\nThe sum of the lengths of the radii is equal to the semiperimeter:\n\n$$r+r+r+r+r=15$$\n\n$$5r=15$$\n\nDivide both sides by $5$:\n\n$$r=3$$\n\nNow we can use the formula $A=25r$ to find the area of the pentagon:\n\n$$A=25r=25(3)=75$$\n\nSo the area of the convex pentagon $ABCDE$ is $\\boxed{75}$."
