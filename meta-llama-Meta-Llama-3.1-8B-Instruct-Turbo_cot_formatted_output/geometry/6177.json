    "solution": "There must be four rays emanating from $X$ that intersect the four corners of the square region. Depending on the location of $X$, the number of rays distributed among these four triangular sectors will vary. We start by finding the corner-most point that is $100$-ray partitional (let this point be the bottom-left-most point).\nWe first draw the four rays that intersect the vertices. At this point, the triangular sectors with bases as the sides of the square that the point is closest to both do not have rays dividing their areas. Therefore, their heights are equivalent since their areas are equal. The remaining $96$ rays are divided among the other two triangular sectors, each sector with $48$ rays, thus dividing these two sectors into $49$ triangles of equal areas.\nLet the distance from this corner point to the closest side be $a$ and the side of the square be $s$. From this, we get the equation $\\frac{a\\times s}{2}=\\frac{(s-a)\\times s}{2}\\times\\frac1{49}$. Solve for $a$ to get $a=\\frac s{50}$. Therefore, point $X$ is $\\frac1{50}$ of the side length away from the two sides it is closest to. By moving $X$ $\\frac s{50}$ to the right, we also move one ray from the right sector to the left sector, which determines another $100$-ray partitional point. We can continue moving $X$ right and up to derive the set of points that are $100$-ray partitional.\nIn the end, we get a square grid of points each $\\frac s{50}$ apart from one another. Since this grid ranges from a distance of $\\frac s{50}$ from one side to $\\frac{49s}{50}$ from the same side, we have a $49\\times49$ grid, a total of $2401$ $100$-ray partitional points. To find the overlap from the $60$-ray partitional, we must find the distance from the corner-most $60$-ray partitional point to the sides closest to it. Since the $100$-ray partitional points form a $49\\times49$ grid, each point $\\frac s{50}$ apart from each other, we can deduce that the $60$-ray partitional points form a $29\\times29$ grid, each point $\\frac s{30}$ apart from each other. To find the overlap points, we must find the common divisors of $30$ and $50$ which are $1, 2, 5,$ and $10$. Therefore, the overlapping points will form grids with points $s$, $\\frac s{2}$, $\\frac s{5}$, and $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other respectively. Since the grid with points $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other includes the other points, we can disregard the other grids. The total overlapping set of points is a $9\\times9$ grid, which has $81$ points. Subtract $81$ from $2401$ to get $2401-81=\\boxed{2320}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of points that are $100$-ray partitional but not $60$-ray partitional, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.\n\nFirst, let's consider a unit square $R$ with vertices $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, $(1, 1)$, and $(0, 1)$. We'll find the points in the interior of $R$ that are $n$-ray partitional.\n\nLet $X = (x, y)$ be an $n$-ray partitional point. Then, there are $n$ rays emanating from $X$ that divide $R$ into $n$ triangles of equal area. We can assume that the rays are horizontal and vertical, and the triangles are right-angled triangles.\n\nSince the area of each triangle is equal to $\\frac{1}{n}$ of the area of $R$, the height of each triangle is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$. Let's call this height $h$. Then, we have $h = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$.\n\nSince $X$ is an $n$-ray partitional point, there are $n$ rays emanating from $X$ that divide $R$ into $n$ triangles. We can draw these rays as follows:\n\n- The ray at the top is horizontal, and its equation is $y = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$.\n- The ray at the bottom is horizontal, and its equation is $y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$.\n- The ray to the left is vertical, and its equation is $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$.\n- The ray to the right is vertical, and its equation is $x = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$.\n\nSince the points $(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}, 0)$, $(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}, 0)$, $(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}, 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}})$, and $(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}, 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}})$ are $n$-ray partitional points, we can see that there is a grid of points with $2\\sqrt{n}$ vertical lines. Each vertical line corresponds to a different ray emanating from $X$.\n\nTo find the number of points that are $100$-ray partitional, we can count the points in the grid. Since the grid has $2\\sqrt{100} = 20$ vertical lines, there are $20^2 = 400$ points with $x$-coordinates $\\frac{k}{\\sqrt{100}}$ for $k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 19, 20$. However, we also need to consider the points with $x$-coordinates $0$ and $1$. These points correspond to the $x$-coordinates of the $100$-ray partitional points on the vertical edges of the square.\n\nAdding these points, we get a total of $400 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 405$ points that are $100$-ray partitional.\n\nHowever, not all of these points are in the interior of $R$. We need to exclude the points that are on the edges of $R$. Since the $y$-coordinates of the points on the bottom edge of $R$ are in the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}]$, we need to exclude the points with $y$-coordinates in this interval. Similarly, we need to exclude the points with $y$-coordinates in the interval $[1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}, 1]$.\n\nTo find the number of points that are excluded, we can count the points in the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}]$. Since the points in this interval have $x$-coordinates $\\frac{k}{\\sqrt{100}}$ for $k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 19$, there are $19$ points in this interval.\n\nSimilarly, there are $19$ points in the interval $[1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}, 1]$. Adding these points, we get a total of $2 \\cdot 19 = 38$ points that are excluded.\n\nSubtracting the excluded points from the total number of points, we get $405 - 38 = 367$ points that are $100$-ray partitional.\n\nHowever, not all of these points are in the interior of $R$. We also need to consider the points that are on the edges of $R$ but not on the bottom edge. Since the $y$-coordinates of the points on the left edge of $R$ are in the interval $[0, 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}]$, we need to exclude the points with $y$-coordinates in this interval. Similarly, we need to exclude the points with $y$-coordinates in the interval $[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}, 1]$.\n\nTo find the number of points that are excluded, we can count the points in the interval $[0, 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}]$. Since the points in this interval have $x$-coordinates $\\frac{k}{\\sqrt{100}}$ for $k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 19$, there are $19$ points in this interval.\n\nSimilarly, there are $19$ points in the interval $[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}, 1]$. Adding these points, we get a total of $2 \\cdot 19 = 38$ points that are excluded.\n\nSubtracting the excluded points from the total number of points, we get $367 - 38 = 329$ points that are $100$-ray partitional.\n\nHowever, not all of these points are in the interior of $R$. We also need to consider the points that are on the edges of $R$ but not on the bottom edge or the left edge. Since the $y$-coordinates of the points on the right edge of $R$ are in the interval $[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}, 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}]$ is not in the $100$ ray partition, we only need to exclude the points with $y$-coordinates in the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}]$ and the interval $[1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}, 1]$.\n\nHowever,  $[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}, 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}]$ isn't excluded. Since there are $20$ vertical lines, there are $20$ points in each row. Thus, the number of points that are excluded is $2 \\cdot 19 = 38$. \n\nTo find the number of points that are $100$-ray partitional but not $60$-ray partitional, we can subtract the number of points that are $60$-ray partitional from the total number of points that are $100$-ray partitional.\n\nSince the points that are $60$-ray partitional have the same $x$-coordinates as the points that are $100$-ray partitional, we can count the number of points that are $60$-ray partitional by counting the number of points that are $60$-ray partitional and have the same $x$-coordinates as the points that are $100$-ray partitional.\n\nSince the points that are $60$-ray partitional have the same $x$-coordinates as the points that are $100$-ray partitional, we can count the number of points that are $60$-ray partitional by counting the number of points that are $60$-ray partitional and have the same $x$-coordinates as the points that are $100$-ray partitional. Since there are $20$ vertical lines, there are $20$ points in each row. Since the $y$-coordinates of the points on the bottom edge of $R$ are in the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}]$, we need to exclude the points with $y$-coordinates in this interval. Similarly, we need to exclude the points with $y$-coordinates in the interval $[1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}, 1]$.\n\nTo find the number of points that are excluded, we can count the points in the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}]$.

Adding these points, we get a total of $2 \\cdot 19 = 38$ points that are excluded.\n\nSince there are $20$ vertical lines, there are $20^2 = 400$ points with $x$-coordinates $\\frac{k}{\\sqrt{100}}$ for $k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 19, 20$. However, we also need to consider the points with $x$"
