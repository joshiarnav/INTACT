    "solution": "The three arcs make up the entire circle, so the circumference of the circle is $3+4+5=12$ and the radius is $\\frac{12}{2\\pi}=\\frac{6}{\\pi}$. Also, the lengths of the arcs are proportional to their corresponding central angles. Thus, we can write the values of the arcs as $3\\theta$, $4\\theta$, and $5\\theta$ for some $\\theta$. By Circle Angle Sum, we obtain $3\\theta+4\\theta+5\\theta=360$. Solving yields $\\theta=30$. Thus, the angles of the triangle are $90$, $120$, and $150$. Using $[ABC]=\\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin{C}$, we obtain $\\frac{r^2}{2}(\\sin{90}+\\sin{120}+\\sin{150})$. Substituting $\\frac{6}{\\pi}$ for $r$ and evaluating yields $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{\\pi^2}(\\sqrt{3}+3)}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the area of the inscribed triangle, we can use the Extended Law of Sines, which relates the side lengths of a triangle to the sines of its angles and the radius of the circumscribed circle.\n\nLet's denote the radius of the circle as r. Then, we can find the angles of the triangle using the formula:\n\n Angle = (Arc Length / Circumference of the circle) * 180 / \u03c0\n\nWe are given the arc lengths as 3, 4, and 5. Let the circumference of the circle be C = 5d (d is the diameter, 2r for the circle). We can write the angles as:\n\n A = (3/5d) * 180 / \u03c0\n B = (4/5d) * 180 / \u03c0\n C = (2/5d) * 180 / \u03c0\n\nHowever, we need to find the radius in terms of a single value. We can use the Extended Law of Sines for a triangle ABC with circumradius R, to relate the side lengths to the sines of the opposite angles. But we'll have to find the side lengths by using the formula of the sine of an angle, given a couple of relevant angles. \n\nWe are given the relevant arc lengths, thus the angles, but not the circumradius or the side lengths. To avoid that, we can use the sine rule. \n\nFirst, the relevant sine rule relevant is given by \n a / sin(A) = 2R \n\nWe are given the circumference, relevant to the diameter. \n C = 5d \n\nThe sine rule gives 2R = C, so the relevant circumradius, 2R = C, is therefore, relevantly, 2R = 5d.\n\nNow we can take the expression A = (3/5d) * 180 / \u03c0, to give us the area of triangle ABC. We now need an expression for the sine of angle A, in terms of the relevant arc lengths. \n\nSince, \n A = (3/5d) * 180 / \u03c0\n\nWe can rearrange it to get\n\nsin(A)/5d = (3/5d) * 180 / (\u03c0 * 5d)\n\nsin(A) = (3/5d) * 180 / (\u03c0 * 5d)\nsin(A) =  (3/5d) * (180 / (\u03c0 * 5d))\n\nsin(A) =  (3/5d) * (180 / (\u03c0 * 5d))\nsin(A) = 18 / (5*\u03c0*d)\n\nNow we can express the area of the triangle ABC using the sine rule. \n\nArea of triangle ABC = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C)\n\nFirst we need to find side a. \n\nFirst we can express a as a relevant side, since \n\na / sin(A) = 2R \n\nSo we can rearrange this to get relevant side a = (2R * sin(A))\n\nSubstituting the value of 2R, gives\n\na = (2 * (5d/2) * sin(A))\na = 5d * sin(A)\n\nSubstituting sin(A) = 18 / (5*\u03c0*d), gives\n\na = 5d * (18/(5*\u03c0*d))\na = 18/(\u03c0*d)\n\nNow we can find the area of triangle ABC using the expression for side 'a'. \n\nArea of triangle ABC = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C)\n\nFirst we need to find relevant side b. \n\nFirst we can express b as b relevant side, since \nb / sin(B) = 2R \n\nSo we can rearrange this to get relevant side b = (2R * sin(B))\n\nSubstituting the value of 2R, gives\n\nb = (2 * (5d/2) * sin(B))\nb = 5d * sin(B)\n\nSubstituting the value of B = (4/5d) * 180 / \u03c0, gives\n\nsin(B) = sin( (4/5d) * 180 / \u03c0)\n\nsin(B) = sin( (4/5d) * 180 / \u03c0)\nsin(B) = 4 / (5d) * sin( (180 / \u03c0))\n\nsin(B) = 4 / (5d) * sin( (180 / \u03c0))\nsin(B) = 4 / (5d) * (\u03c0 / 180)\n\nsin(B) = (4 * \u03c0) / (5 * 180 * d)\n\nsin(B) = (4 * \u03c0) / (5 * 180 * d)\n\nNow we can substitute sin(B) = (4 * \u03c0) / (5 * 180 * d) into b = 5d * sin(B)\n\nb = 5d * (4 * \u03c0) / (5 * 180 * d)\nb = 4 * \u03c0 / (5 * 180 * d)\nb =  (4 * \u03c0) / (900 * d)\n\nNow we can find the area of triangle ABC, using the expression for relevant side b \n\nArea of triangle ABC = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C)\n\nFirst we need to find relevant side c. \n\nFirst we can express c as c relevant side, since \nc / sin(C) = 2R \n\nSo we can rearrange this to get relevant side c = (2R * sin(C))\n\nSubstituting the value of 2R, gives\n\nc = (2 * (5d/2) * sin(C))\nc = 5d * sin(C)\n\nSubstituting the value of C = (2/5d) * 180 / \u03c0, gives\n\nsin(C) = sin( (2/5d) * 180 / \u03c0)\n\nsin(C) =  sin( (2/5d) * 180 / \u03c0)\nsin(C) =  (2/5d) * sin( (180 / \u03c0))\n\nsin(C) = (2/5d) * sin( (180 / \u03c0))\nsin(C) =  (2/5d) * (\u03c0 / 180)\n\nsin(C) = (2 * \u03c0) / (5 * 180 * d)\n\nsin(C) = (2 * \u03c0) / (5 * 180 * d)\n\nNow we can substitute sin(C) = (2 * \u03c0) / (5 * 180 * d) into c = 5d * sin(C)\n\nc = 5d * (2 * \u03c0) / (5 * 180 * d)\nc =  2 * \u03c0 / (180 * d)\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for a = 18/(\u03c0*d), the expression for b = 4 * \u03c0 / (900 * d), and c =  2 * \u03c0 / (180 * d) into the area of the triangle ABC, to give relevant area \n\nArea of triangle ABC = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C)\nArea of triangle ABC = (1/2) * (18/(\u03c0*d)) * (4 * \u03c0 / (900 * d)) * sin(C)\nArea of triangle ABC = (1/2) * (18/(\u03c0*d)) * (4 * \u03c0 / (900 * d)) * (2 * \u03c0 / (180 * d))\nArea of triangle ABC = (1/2) * (18 * 4 * 2 * \u03c0^2) / (\u03c0 * d * 900 * d * 180 * d)\n\nArea of triangle ABC =  (1/2) * (18 * 4 * 2 * \u03c0^2) / (\u03c0 * d^3 * 900 * 180)\nArea of triangle ABC = (18 * 4 * 2 * \u03c0^2) / (2 * \u03c0 * d^3 * 162000)\n\nArea of triangle ABC = (18 * 4 * 2 * \u03c0^2) / (2 * \u03c0 * d^3 * 162000)\nArea of triangle ABC = (144 * 4 * \u03c0^2) / ( \u03c0 * 324000 * d^3)\nArea of triangle ABC = (144 * \u03c0^2 * 4) / (324000 * \u03c0 * d^3)\n\nArea of triangle ABC = (144 * \u03c0^2 * 4) / (324000 * \u03c0 * d^3)\n\nThe area of the triangle is (144 * \u03c0^2) / (324000 * d^3).\n\nNow, to find the area in terms of \u03c0, we need to find d = 2r, using the circumference. \n\n5d = C\n5d = 5/2 * 2\u03c0r\n5d = 5\u03c0r\n\nd = 5\u03c0r / 5\nd = \u03c0r\n\nNow we can substitute d = \u03c0r into the expression for the area of the triangle. \n\nArea of triangle ABC = (144 * \u03c0^2) / (324000 * (\u03c0r)^3)\nArea of triangle ABC = (144 * 1 / \u03c0) / (324000 * r^3)\n\nArea of triangle ABC = (144 / \u03c0) / (324000 * r^3)\n\nArea of triangle ABC = ( 144 / (324000 * r^3 * \u03c0))\n\nArea of triangle ABC =  ( 144 / (324000 * r^3 * \u03c0))\n\nArea of triangle ABC =  (144 / (5 * 32400 * \u03c0 * r^3))\n\nArea of triangle ABC =  (144 / (5 * 32400 * \u03c0^3 * \u03c0 * r^3))\n\nArea of triangle ABC =  (144 / (162000000 * \u03c0^2 * r^3))\n\nArea of triangle ABC =  ("
