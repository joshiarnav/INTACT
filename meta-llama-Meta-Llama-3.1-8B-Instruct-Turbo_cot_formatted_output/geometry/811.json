    "model_solution": "To find the measure of $\\angle RPQ$, we first recall that $QP$ bisects $\\angle SQR$, meaning that $x^\\circ$ is equal on each of the two sides of the bisector. This results in the measure of $\\angle PQS$ also being $x^\\circ$. \n\nNow, we know that $\\angle RPQ=3y^\\circ$, and we want to find the measure of this angle. The first step is to determine the value of $x^\\circ$. \n\nWe start by drawing a line from $R$ to $S$ and labeling it $RS$. The angle between $RS$ and $PQ$ is $\\angle RQS$, and we know that $\\angle RSQ=2y^\\circ$. Since $RP=PQ$, we can infer that $\\angle RQS=\\angle QRP=2x^\\circ$.\n\nNow, we can use the sum of the angles in a triangle. The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$. Here, we know that $\\angle RQS=2x^\\circ$, $\\angle QRP=2x^\\circ$, and $\\angle RPQ=3y^\\circ$. Also, since $RPS$ is not a straight line, we can infer that $\\angle SPQ=180^\\circ-3y^\\circ-x^\\circ$.\n\nUsing the fact that $\\angle PQS=x^\\circ$ and $\\angle RPS=2x^\\circ$, we can set up the following equation: $x^\\circ+2x^\\circ+3y^\\circ=180^\\circ$. Simplifying this, we get $3x^\\circ+3y^\\circ=180^\\circ$, or $x^\\circ+y^\\circ=60^\\circ$.\n\nNow, we recall that $\\angle RSQ=2y^\\circ$. Since $RPS$ is not a straight line, we can infer that $180^\\circ-2y^\\circ=2x^\\circ + x^\\circ$. Simplifying this, we get $180^\\circ-2y^\\circ=3x^\\circ$.\n\nSince we know that $x^\\circ+y^\\circ=60^\\circ$, we can substitute for $x^\\circ$ to get $60^\\circ-y^\\circ=3x^\\circ$. Now, we can set up the following equation: $3x^\\circ=180^\\circ-2y^\\circ$. \n\nNow, we can substitute $60^\\circ-y^\\circ$ for $x^\\circ$ in the equation $3x^\\circ=180^\\circ-2y^\\circ$. This gives us $3(60^\\circ-y^\\circ)=180^\\circ-2y^\\circ$, which simplifies to $180^\\circ-3y^\\circ=180^\\circ-2y^\\circ$. \n\nWe can subtract $180^\\circ$ from both sides to get $-3y^\\circ=-2y^\\circ$. Now, we can divide both sides by $-1$ to get $3y^\\circ=2y^\\circ$.\n\nNow, we can subtract $2y^\\circ$ from both sides to get $y^\\circ=0$. However, this is not the correct solution. We can see this by plugging in $y^\\circ=0$ into the equation $x^\\circ+y^\\circ=60^\\circ$. This gives us $x^\\circ=60^\\circ$, which is not possible since $RPS$ is not a straight line.\n\nThe problem with our previous solution is that we assumed that $RPS$ is a straight line. However, this is not true. Instead, we know that $\\angle RPS=180^\\circ - (2x^\\circ + x^\\circ + 3y^\\circ) = 180^\\circ-5x^\\circ-3y^\\circ$.\n\nNow, we recall that $\\angle RSQ=2y^\\circ$. Since $RPS$ is not a straight line, we can infer that $180^\\circ-2y^\\circ=2x^\\circ+x^\\circ+3y^\\circ$. Simplifying this, we get $180^\\circ-2y^\\circ=3x^\\circ+3y^\\circ$.\n\nNow, we recall that $x^\\circ+y^\\circ=60^\\circ$. We can rewrite this as $x^\\circ=60^\\circ-y^\\circ$.\n\nNow, we can substitute $60^\\circ-y^\\circ$ for $x^\\circ$ in the equation $180^\\circ-2y^\\circ=3x^\\circ+3y^\\circ$. This gives us $180^\\circ-2y^\\circ=3(60^\\circ-y^\\circ)+3y^\\circ$, which simplifies to $180^\\circ-2y^\\circ=180^\\circ-3y^\\circ$. \n\nWe can add $2y^\\circ$ to both sides to get $180^\\circ=180^\\circ-y^\\circ$. Now, we can subtract $180^\\circ$ from both sides to get $0=-y^\\circ$.\n\nWe can see that this is not possible. This is because $y^\\circ$ cannot be equal to $0$, as this would make $\\angle RSQ$ equal to $0^\\circ$, which is not possible since $RPS$ is not a straight line.\n\nHowever, we can recall that $\\angle RPS=180^\\circ-(2x^\\circ+3y^\\circ)$. Now, we can substitute $x^\\circ=60^\\circ-y^\\circ$ into this equation. This gives us $\\angle RPS=180^\\circ-(2(60^\\circ-y^\\circ)+3y^\\circ)$. Simplifying this, we get $\\angle RPS=180^\\circ-120^\\circ+2y^\\circ-3y^\\circ$.\n\nThis simplifies to $\\angle RPS=60^\\circ-y^\\circ$.\n\nWe can recall that $\\angle RPS$ is adjacent to $\\angle RPQ$, and we know that $\\angle RPQ=3y^\\circ$. This means that $\\angle RPS$ and $\\angle RPQ$ are supplementary angles.\n\nTherefore, we can write the equation $\\angle RPS+\\angle RPQ=180^\\circ$. Plugging in what we know, we get $(60^\\circ-y^\\circ)+3y^\\circ=180^\\circ$.\n\nNow, we can add $y^\\circ$ to both sides to get $60^\\circ+2y^\\circ=180^\\circ$. Now, we can subtract $60^\\circ$ from both sides to get $2y^\\circ=120^\\circ$.\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by $2$ to get $y^\\circ=60^\\circ$.\n\nNow, we can substitute $y^\\circ=60^\\circ$ into the equation $x^\\circ+y^\\circ=60^\\circ$. This gives us $x^\\circ+60^\\circ=60^\\circ$, which simplifies to $x^\\circ=0$. However, this is not the correct solution. We can recall that $x^\\circ$ cannot be $0$ since $\\angle RQS$ and $\\angle QRP$ are not supplementary angles.\n\nHowever, we can recall that $x^\\circ$ is the measure of two angles. This means that $x^\\circ$ must be equal to $2y^\\circ$ and $2x^\\circ$.\n\nWe recall that $\\angle RQS$ is equal to $2x^\\circ$ and $\\angle QRP$ is equal to $2x^\\circ$. This means that $\\angle RQS=\\angle QRP$. This also means that $\\angle RSQ=\\angle RPQ$, since they are vertical angles.\n\nWe know that $\\angle RSQ=2y^\\circ$ and $\\angle RPQ=3y^\\circ$. However, this is a contradiction, since $\\angle RSQ$ and $\\angle RPQ$ cannot be equal.\n\nHowever, we can recall that $2y^\\circ=2x^\\circ+3y^\\circ$. This simplifies to $2x^\\circ-2y^\\circ=0$. This gives us $x^\\circ=y^\\circ$.\n\nNow, we can substitute $x^\\circ=y^\\circ$ into the equation $x^\\circ+y^\\circ=60^\\circ$. This gives us $y^\\circ+y^\\circ=60^\\circ$, which simplifies to $2y^\\circ=60^\\circ$.\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by $2$ to get $y^\\circ=30^\\circ$. \n\nSince $x^\\circ=y^\\circ$, we can substitute $y^\\circ=30^\\circ$ into this equation. This gives us $x^\\circ=30^\\circ$.\n\nWe can recall that $\\angle RPQ=3y^\\circ$. Now, we can substitute $y^\\circ=30^\\circ$ into this equation. This gives us $\\angle RPQ=3(30^\\circ)$.\n\nThis simplifies to $\\angle RPQ=90^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the measure of $\\angle RPQ$ is $\\boxed{90}$."
