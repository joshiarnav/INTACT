    "model_solution": "We are given a problem with a trisected line segment $\\overline{AD}$, along with a midpoint $M$. To find the length of $\\overline{AD}$, we will break it down step by step.\n\n1. We know that $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, so the length of $\\overline{AM}$ and $\\overline{MD}$ is equal. Let's call this length $x$. \n\n   So, we have:\n   - $AM = x$\n   - $MD = x$\n\n2. Since $B$ and $C$ trisect $\\overline{AD}$, we know that the line segment is divided into three equal parts. This means that:\n   - $AB = BD = CD = \\frac{x}{3}$\n\n3. We are given that $MC = 8$. To find the length of $\\overline{AD}$, we need to find the length of $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$, which are equal to $\\frac{x}{3}$. \n\n   Since $C$ is the trisection point and $M$ is the midpoint, we can say that:\n   - $MC = CD$\n\n   We are given that $MC = 8$, so:\n   - $CD = 8$\n\n4. Now, we can express the length of $\\overline{AB}$ in terms of $x$. Since $AB = CD$, we have:\n   - $AB = CD = 8$\n\n   But, we also know that:\n   - $AB = \\frac{x}{3}$\n\n   Equating the two expressions, we get:\n   - $\\frac{x}{3} = 8$\n\n5. To find the value of $x$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $3$. This gives us:\n   - $x = 8 \\times 3$\n   - $x = 24$\n\n   So, the length of $\\overline{AM}$ and $\\overline{MD}$ is $24$ units.\n\n6. Since the length of $\\overline{AD}$ is twice the length of $\\overline{AM}$ or $\\overline{MD}$, we can find the length of $\\overline{AD}$ by doubling the length of $\\overline{AM}$ or $\\overline{MD}$:\n   - $AD = 2x$\n   - $AD = 2 \\times 24$\n   - $AD = 48$\n\nTherefore, the length of $\\overline{AD}$ is $\\boxed{48}$."
