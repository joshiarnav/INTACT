    "model_solution": "To find the quotient when $8x^3+16x^2-7x+4$ is divided by $2x+5$, we will use polynomial long division. This process involves dividing the highest degree term of the dividend by the highest degree term of the divisor, then multiplying the entire divisor by the result, and subtracting that from the dividend.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Divide the leading term of the dividend, $8x^3$, by the leading term of the divisor, $2x$, to get $4x^2$.\n\n2. Multiply the entire divisor, $2x+5$, by the result, $4x^2$. This gives $8x^3+20x^2$.\n\n3. Subtract $8x^3+20x^2$ from the dividend, $8x^3+16x^2-7x+4$. This leaves us with a new dividend of $-4x^2-7x+4$.\n\n4. Repeat the process by dividing the leading term of the new dividend, $-4x^2$, by the leading term of the divisor, $2x$, to get $-2x$.\n\n5. Multiply the entire divisor, $2x+5$, by the result, $-2x$. This gives $-4x^2-10x$.\n\n6. Subtract $-4x^2-10x$ from the new dividend, $-4x^2-7x+4$. This leaves us with a new dividend of $3x+4$.\n\n7. Repeat the process by dividing the leading term of the new dividend, $3x$, by the leading term of the divisor, $2x$, to get $\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\n8. Multiply the entire divisor, $2x+5$, by the result, $\\frac{3}{2}$. This gives $3x+\\frac{15}{2}$.\n\n9. Subtract $3x+\\frac{15}{2}$ from the new dividend, $3x+4$. This leaves us with a new dividend of $-\\frac{7}{2}$.\n\nHowever, since the degree of $-\\frac{7}{2}$ (a constant) is less than the degree of $2x+5$, we cannot continue this process further.\n\nOur quotient is $4x^2-2x+\\frac{3}{2}$, but we must also include the remainder. The remainder is $-\\frac{7}{2}$. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{4x^2-2x+\\frac{3}{2} -\\frac{7}{2(2x+5)}}$"
