    "problem": "Let $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c$ for all real numbers $x$, where $c$ is some real number.  For what values of $c$ does $f(f(x))$ have exactly $3$ distinct real roots?",
    "solution": "Suppose the function $f(x) = 0$ has only one distinct root.  If $x_1$ is a root of $f(f(x)) = 0,$ then we must have $f(x_1) = r_1.$  But the equation $f(x) = r_1$ has at most two roots.  Therefore, the equation $f(x) = 0$ must have two distinct roots.  Let them be $r_1$ and $r_2.$\n\nSince $f(f(x)) = 0$ has three distinct roots, one of the equations $f(x) = r_1$ or $f(x) = r_2$ has one distinct root.  Without loss generality, assume that $f(x) = r_1$ has one distinct root.  Then $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c = r_1$ has one root.  This means\n\\[x^2 + 6x + c - r_1\\]must be equal to $(x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9 = 0,$ so $c - r_1 = 9.$  Hence, $r_1 = c - 9.$\n\nSince $r_1$ is a root of $f(x) = 0,$\n\\[(c - 9)^2 + 6(c - 9) + c = 0.\\]Expanding, we get $c^2 - 11c + 27 = 0,$ so\n\\[c = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{2}.\\]If $c = \\frac{11 - \\sqrt{13}}{2},$ then $r_1 = c - 9 = -\\frac{7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}$ and $r_2 = -6 - r_1 = \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{13}}{2},$ so\n\\[f(x) = x^2 + 6x + \\frac{11 - \\sqrt{13}}{2} = \\left( x + \\frac{7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\right) \\left( x + \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\right) = (x + 3)^2 - \\frac{7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}.\\]The equation $f(x) = r_1$ has a double root of $x = -3,$ and the equation $f(x) = r_2$ has two roots, so $f(f(x)) = 0$ has exactly three roots.\n\nIf $c = \\frac{11 + \\sqrt{13}}{2},$ then $r_1 = c - 9 = \\frac{-7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}$ and $r_2 = -6 - r_1 = -\\frac{5 + \\sqrt{13}}{2},$ and\n\\[f(x) = x^2 + 6x + \\frac{11 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} = \\left( x + \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\right) \\left( x + \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\right) = (x + 3)^2 + \\frac{-7 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}.\\]The equation $f(x) = r_1$ has a double root of $x = -3,$ but the equation $f(x) = r_2$ has no real roots, so $f(f(x)) = 0$ has exactly one root.\n\nTherefore, $c = \\boxed{\\frac{11 - \\sqrt{13}}{2}}.$",

    "model_solution": "To find the values of $c$ for which $f(f(x))$ has exactly 3 distinct real roots, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Compute $f(f(x))$**:\n   First, we need to find an expression for $f(f(x))$. We have $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c$.\n   \\[\n   f(f(x)) = (f(x))^2 + 6(f(x)) + c\n   \\]\n   Substituting $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c$ into this equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   f(f(x)) = (x^2 + 6x + c)^2 + 6(x^2 + 6x + c) + c\n   \\]\n   Expanding this equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   f(f(x)) = x^4 + 12x^3 + (6 + c^2 + 36 + 6c)x^2 + (72 + 6c + 6c^2)x + c^2 + 6c + c\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this expression, we get:\n   \\[\n   f(f(x)) = x^4 + 12x^3 + (42 + c^2 + 6c)x^2 + (72 + 12c)x + c^2 + 7c\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the discriminant of $f(f(x ))$**:\n   To determine the number of roots, we need to look at the discriminant of $f(f(x))$. The discriminant of a quadratic function $ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$. In this case, the quadratic is $f(f(x)) = x^4 + 12x^3 + (42 + c^2 + 6c)x^2 + (72 + 12c)x + c^2 + 7c$. The coefficients are: $a = 1$, $b = 72 + 12c$, and $c = c^2 + 7c$.\n   Therefore, the discriminant of $f(f(x))$ is:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = (72 + 12c)^2 - 4(1)(c^2 + 7c)\n   \\]\n   Expanding this equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = 5184 + 1440c + 144c^2 - 4c^2 - 28c\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this expression, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = 5184 + 1412c + 140c^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for $c$**:\n   To find the values of $c$ for which $f(f(x))$ has exactly 3 distinct real roots, we need to solve the equation $\\Delta = 0$.\n   \\[\n   5184 + 1412c + 140c^2 = 0\n   \\]\n   Dividing this equation by 4, we get:\n   \\[\n   1296 + 353c + 35c^2 = 0\n   \\]\n   This is a quadratic equation in $c$. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for $c$:\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   In this case, $a = 35$, $b = 353$, and $c = -1296$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{-353 \\pm \\sqrt{353^2 - 4(35)(-1296)}}{2(35)}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this expression, we get:\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{-353 \\pm \\sqrt{124201 + 180480}}{70}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{-353 \\pm \\sqrt{304681}}{70}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{-353 \\pm 551}{70}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, we have two possible solutions for $c$:\n   \\[\n   c_1 = \\frac{-353 + 551}{70} = \\frac{198}{70} = \\frac{99}{35}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   c_2 = \\frac{-353 - 551}{70} = \\frac{-904}{70} = \\frac{-452}{35}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the solutions**:\n   We need to verify that these solutions give exactly 3 distinct real roots for $f(f(x))$.\n\n   We know that a quadratic function has exactly 2 distinct real roots if its discriminant is positive. A quadratic function has exactly 1 distinct real root if its discriminant is zero. A quadratic function has no real roots if its discriminant is negative.\n   Let's find the discriminant of $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c$, which is:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta_f = 6^2 - 4(1)(c)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta_f = 36 - 4c\n   \\]\n   The discriminant of $f(x)$ is positive if $36 - 4c > 0$. This is true for $c < 9$. The discriminant of $f(x)$ is zero if $36 - 4c = 0$. This is true for $c = 9$. The discriminant of $f(x)$ is negative if $36 - 4c < 0$. This is true for $c > 9$.\n\n   If $c < 9$, then $f(x)$ has exactly 2 distinct real roots. In this case, $f(f(x))$ has exactly 4 distinct real roots. If $c > 9$, then $f(x)$ has no real roots. In this case, $f(f(x))$ has exactly 2 distinct real roots.\n\n   If $c = 9$, then $f(x)$ has exactly 1 distinct real root. In this case, $f(f(x))$ has exactly 3 distinct real roots.\n\n   Therefore, the value of $c$ for which $f(f(x))$ has exactly 3 distinct real roots is $\\boxed{9}$."
