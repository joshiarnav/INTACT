    "problem": "The domain of the function $q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$ is $[0,\\infty)$. What is the range?",
    "solution": "We have $q(x) = (x^2+2)^2$. We wish to determine the set of all $y$ for which $q(x)=y$ has solutions. We must have $y\\ge 0$, since $q(x)$ is a square and squares are nonnegative. Under the assumption $y\\ge 0$, we have:\n$$\\begin{array}{r r@{~=~}l}\n& y & (x^2+2)^2 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & \\sqrt y & x^2+2 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & \\sqrt y-2 & x^2 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$We see that $\\sqrt y-2\\ge 0$ because squares are nonnegative. Thus, we need $y\\ge 4$. When $y\\ge 4$, we have $y=q(x)$ by setting $x$ equal to either of $\\pm \\sqrt{\\sqrt y-2}$, and so any $y\\ge 4$ can be achieved.\n\nTherefore, the range of $q(x)$ is $\\boxed{[4,\\infty)}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the range of the function q(x), we need to determine the set of all possible output values (y-values) that q(x) can produce for the given input values (x-values).\n\nSince the function is q(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4, we can analyze its behavior by looking at its individual terms.\n\n1. The term x^4 is always non-negative (or zero) because it is raised to an even power. This means that x^4 \u2265 0 for all real numbers x.\n\n2. The term 4x^2 is also always non-negative (or zero) for the same reason. Since it is a multiple of x^2, it is non-negative for all real numbers x.\n\n3. The constant term 4 is a positive number.\n\nSince all the terms are non-negative, the sum of these terms (q(x)) will be non-negative as well. This means that q(x) \u2265 0 for all x in its domain [0, \u221e).\n\nNow, let's analyze the behavior of q xsi (x) as x approaches infinity. As x becomes larger and larger, the term x^4 dominates the expression. Since x^4 grows faster than any linear function, the value of q(x) will increase without bound as x approaches infinity.\n\nIn other words, the function q(x) approaches infinity as x becomes larger and larger.\n\nNow, to find the range of q(x), we need to find the set of all non-negative values that q(x) can produce. This includes the value 0, which is the minimum value of q(x) in its domain. As x approaches infinity, q(x) approaches infinity, which means that there is no maximum value for q(x) in its domain.\n\nTherefore, the range of q(x) is [0, \u221e).\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{[0, \\infty)}$."
