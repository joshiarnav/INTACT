    "problem": "Given that $2+\\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the equation \\[x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 10 = 0\\]and that $a$ and $b$ are rational numbers, compute $b.$",
    "solution": "Because the coefficients of the polynomial are rational, the radical conjugate $2-\\sqrt{3}$ must also be a root of the polynomial. By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of this polynomial is $-10,$ and the product of these two roots is $(2+\\sqrt3)(2-\\sqrt3) = 1,$ so the remaining root must be $\\frac{-10}{1} = -10.$ Then by Vieta's formulas again, we have \\[b = (-10)(2-\\sqrt3) + (-10)(2+\\sqrt3) + (2+\\sqrt3)(2-\\sqrt3) = \\boxed{-39}.\\]",

    "model_solution": "To find the value of b, we will first find the other roots of the cubic equation. \n\nGiven that $2+\\sqrt{3}$ is a root of the equation, we can also say that $2-\\sqrt{3}$ is also a root of the equation, since the coefficients of the equation are rational numbers.\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation with roots $2+\\sqrt{3}$ and $2-\\sqrt{3}$:\n\n$(x-(2+\\sqrt{3}))(x-(2-\\sqrt{3})) = 0$\n\nExpanding the quadratic equation:\n\n$(x-2-\\sqrt{3})(x-2+\\sqrt{3}) = 0$\n\n$(x-2)^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 0$\n\n$x^2 - 4x + 4 - 3 = 0$\n\n$x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0$\n\nWe know that this quadratic has the same roots as the cubic equation, and the product of the roots of a quadratic equation is equal to the constant term divided by the leading coefficient. \n\nAlso, since the product of the roots of the cubic equation is equal to the constant term of the cubic equation (-10), and the product of the roots of the quadratic equation is 1, the product of the third root and 1 is -10. Therefore, the third root is -10.\n\nNow, we can write the cubic equation as:\n\n$(x-(2+\\sqrt{3}))(x-(2-\\sqrt{3}))(x+10) = 0$\n\nExpanding the cubic equation:\n\n$(x^2-4x+1)(x+10) = 0$\n\nExpanding the cubic equation:\n\n$x^3 + 10x^2 -4x^2 - 40x + x + 10 = 0$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$x^3 + 6x^2 - 39x + 10 = 0$\n\nThe coefficients of the cubic equation are a = 6 and b = -39.\n\nThe value of b is $\\boxed{-39}$."
