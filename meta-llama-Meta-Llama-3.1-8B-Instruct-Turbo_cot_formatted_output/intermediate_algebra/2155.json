    "model_solution": "To find the distance between the foci of the given ellipse, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert to standard form**: Complete the square to convert the given equation to the standard form of an ellipse.\n\nThe given equation is: $16x^2 - 64x + y^2 + 4y + 4 = 0$\n\nFirst, group the x terms and y terms and move the constant to the other side:\n\n$16(x^2 - 4x) + (y^2 + 4y) = -4$\n\nNow, complete the square for both x and y terms:\n\n$16(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 + 4y + 4) = -4 + 64 + 4$\n\n$16(x - 2)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 64$\n\nNow, divide both sides by 64 to get the standard form:\n\n$\\frac{(x - 2)^2}{4} + \\frac{(y + 2)^2}{64} = 1$\n\n2. **Identify a, b, and c**: From the standard form, we can identify a, b, and c as follows:\n\n$a^2 = 4$ and $b^2 = 64$\n\nNow, take the square root to get a and b:\n\n$a = 2$ and $b = 8$\n\nSince it's an ellipse, we know that $a^2 < b^2$, so we can conclude that this is a vertical ellipse.\n\n3. **Find c**: For an ellipse, the relationship between a, b, and c is given by:\n\n$c^2 = b^2 - a^2$\n\nSubstitute the values of a and b:\n\n$c^2 = 64 - 4$\n$c^2 = 60$\n$c = \\sqrt{60} = 2\\sqrt{15}$\n\n4. **Find the distance between the foci**: The distance between the foci is given by:\n\n$2c = 2(2\\sqrt{15}) = 4\\sqrt{15}$"
