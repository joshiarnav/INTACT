    "solution": "We can factor the equation as\n\\[x^6 (x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379) = 0.\\]Since we are looking for positive real solutions, this reduces to\n\\[x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379.\\]Consider the function $f(x) = x^4 + 7x^3 + 14x^2 + 1729x - 1379.$  This is increasing for $x > 0.$  Also, $f(0) < 0$ and $f(1) > 0,$ so there is exactly $\\boxed{1}$ positive real solution, which lies in the interval $(0,1).$",

    "model_solution": "To find the number of positive real solutions to the given equation, we need to analyze the function and apply Descartes' rule of signs.\n\nStep 1: Write down the equation in the form of $f(x) = 0$. \n\\[ x^{10}+7x^9+14x^8+1729x^7-1379x^6 = 0 \\]\n\nStep 2: Replace $x$ with $-x$ and count the number of sign changes in the resulting expression. \n\\[ (-x)^{10}+7(-x)^9+14(-x)^8+1729(-x)^7-1379(-x)^6 \\]\n\\[ = x^{10}-7x^9+14x^8-1729x^7-1379x^6 \\]\n\nStep 3: Count the number of sign changes in the modified expression. There are 3 sign changes (from positive to negative, then from negative to positive, then from positive to negative), so the number of negative real roots is less than or equal to 3.\n\nStep 4: Now, let's count the number of sign changes in the original expression (from Step 1). There is 1 sign change (from positive to negative), so the number of positive real roots is less than or equal to 1.\n\nSince we are looking for the number of positive real solutions, we need to find the number of positive real roots."
