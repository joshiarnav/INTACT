We calculate this as:\n\n   $(-11 + 3i)_{\\text{real}} + (3 - 7i)_{\\text{real}} = -11 + 3$\n\n   $= -8$\n\n3. **Find the imaginary part of the mid-point**: The imaginary part of the mid-point is the average of the imaginary parts of the two end-points. We calculate this as:\n\n   $(-11 + 3i)_{\\text{imaginary}} + (3 - 7i)_{\\text{imaginary}} = 3 - 7$\n\n   $= -4$\n\n4. **Combine the real and imaginary parts to form the complex number**: The complex number corresponding to the mid-point is:\n\n   $-8 + (-4)i$\n\n   This can be simplified to:\n\n   $\\boxed{-8 - 4i}$."
