    "problem": "When an integer is divided by 15, the remainder is 7. Find the sum of the remainders when the same integer is divided by 3 and by 5.",
    "solution": "We let our integer be $n$.  the first sentence tells us that  \\[n\\equiv 7\\pmod {15}.\\] Since 3 and 5 are both factors of 15 we deduce \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv2\\pmod5.\n\\end{align*} Therefore the remainders in question are 1 and 2, and their sum is $\\boxed{3}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nGiven: When an integer is divided by 15, the remainder is 7. \n\nThis can be represented as:\n\nn = 15q + 7\n\nwhere n is the integer and q is the quotient.\n\nNow, let's consider the given divisions:\n- Division by 3:\n- Division by 5:\n\nWe can start by rewriting the equation n = 15q + 7 as n = 3*5q + 7.\n\nSince the remainders we are asked to find are for division by 3 and 5, we can analyze the given equation n = 3*5q + 7.\n\nWhen n is divided by 3, the remainder will be the remainder when 7 is divided by 3. \n\n7 divided by 3 gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when n is divided by 3 is 1.\n\nNow, let's find the remainder when n is divided by 5.\n\n7 divided by 5 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 2.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when n is divided by 5 is 2.\n\nThe sum of the remainders when the same integer is divided by 3 and by 5 is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{3}$."
