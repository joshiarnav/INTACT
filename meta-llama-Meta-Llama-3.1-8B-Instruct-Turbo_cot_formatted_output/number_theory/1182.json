    "solution": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7. So the residue of the sum is  $$\n182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\equiv \\boxed{10} \\pmod{14}.\n$$",

    "model_solution": "To find the residue of the expression $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. First, we'll find the residue of $182\\pmod{14}$. \nThe largest multiple of $14$ less than or equal to $182$ is $14\\cdot 13 = 182$. So, \n$182\\equiv 0\\pmod{14}$.\n\n2. Next, we'll find the residue of $12\\pmod{14}$.\nThe largest multiple of $14$ less than or equal to $12$ is $14\\cdot 0 = 0$. The next multiple of $14$ greater than $12$ is $14\\cdot 1 = 14$. Therefore, the residue of $12$ mod $14$ is $12 - 0 = 12$, but we actually do not need to find the residue; we just need the number itself because we are multiplying by the whole number $12$, and that whole number is $12$.\n\n3. Then, we'll find the residue of $15\\pmod{14}$.\nThe largest multiple of $14$ less than or equal to $15$ is $14\\cdot 1 = 14$. The next multiple of $14$ greater than $15$ is $14\\cdot 1 + 1 = 15$. Therefore, the residue of $15$ mod $14$ is $15 - 14 = 1$.\n\n4. Now, we'll find the residue of $3\\pmod{14}$.\nThe largest multiple of $14$ less than or equal to $3$ is $14\\cdot 0 = 0$. The next multiple of $14$ greater than $3$ is $14\\cdot 0 + 1 = 1$. Therefore, the residue of $3$ mod $14$ is $3 - 0 = 3$, but we actually do not need to find the residue; we just need the number itself because we are adding $3$, and that whole number is $3$.\n\n5. Now, we can rewrite the original expression using the residues we found: \n$182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3\\pmod{14} \\equiv 0\\cdot 12 - 1\\cdot 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$.\n\n6. Next, we can simplify the expression:\n$0\\cdot 12 - 1\\cdot 7 + 3\\pmod{14} \\equiv -7 + 3\\pmod{14}$.\n\n7. Next, we can simplify the expression further by combining the constants:\n$-7 + 3\\pmod{14} \\equiv -4\\pmod{14}$.\n\n8. To make the residue positive, we can add $14$ to $-4$, because $-4 \\equiv -4 + 14 \\pmod{14}$:\n$-4 + 14 \\pmod{14} \\equiv 10 \\pmod{14}$.\n\nTherefore, the residue of the expression $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$ is $\\boxed{10}$."
