    "problem": "In a physical education class, students line up in four rows to do exercises. One particular class has over 30 students, with three rows having the same number of students and one row having one more student than the other three rows. What is the smallest possible class size for this physical education class?",
    "solution": "If the first three rows have 1 student, the last row must have two students, so there are 5 students in total. This is not greater than 30, so we must add another student to each row. This gives 9, which is still not greater than 30. We have to keep adding 4 until we get to a number greater than 30. As a result, we reach 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33. 33 is the first integer greater than 30, so this class has $\\boxed{33}$ students.",

    "model_solution": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. There are four rows, and three of them have the same number of students. Let's call this number 'x'. The fourth row has one more student than the other three rows, so it has 'x + 1' students.\n\n2. The total number of students in the class is the sum of the students in each row. Since there are four rows, the total number of students is '3x + (x + 1)'.\n\n3. Simplify the equation: \n   - '3x + x + 1' can be combined as '4x + 1'.\n\n4. We know that the class has over 30 students. So, the smallest possible class size must be at least 31.\n\n5. To find the smallest possible class size, we need to find the smallest value of 'x' for which '4x + 1' is greater than or equal to 31.\n\n6. Set up the inequality: \n   - 4x + 1 \u2265 31\n\n7. Subtract 1 from both sides of the inequality: \n   - 4x \u2265 30\n\n8. Divide both sides of the inequality by 4: \n   - x \u2265 7.5\n\n9. Since the number of students in a row must be an integer, the smallest value of 'x' is 8.\n\n10. Substitute 'x = 8' into the equation '4x + 1' to find the smallest possible class size: \n    - 4(8) + 1 = 33\n\nSo, the smallest possible class size for this physical education class is $\\boxed{33}$."
