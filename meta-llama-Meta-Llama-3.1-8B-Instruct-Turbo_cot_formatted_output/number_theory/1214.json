    "problem": "What is $2343_6+15325_6$? Express your answer in base $6$.",
    "solution": "Adding the first digits, we get $8$, hence $2$ after carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, again with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $2$, with carrying. Finally, adding $1$ to one, we get $2$. Thus our final answer is $\\boxed{22112_6}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to add two numbers in base 6. First, we align the numbers vertically with the same place values in the same column.\n\n$2343_6$\n$15325_6$\n\nNow, we perform addition step by step from right to left.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits (3 and 5).\n   3 + 5 = 8. \n   Since 2343 is in base 6, we write 2 in the rightmost digit and carry over 1 to the next digit (the ones place).\n\n  $2343_6$\n  $15325_6$\n  $-1$\n  $-$\n\n2. Add the carried over 1 to the ones place (4 and 1).\n   1 + 4 + 1 = 6. \n   We write 0 in the ones place and carry over 1 to the next digit (the sixes place).\n\n  $2343_6$\n  $15325_6$\n  $-11$\n  $-$\n\n3. Add the carried over 1 to the sixes place (3 and 1).\n   3 + 1 + 1 = 5. \n   We write 5 in the sixes place.\n\n  $2343_6$\n  $15325_6$\n  $-112$\n  $-$\n\n4. Add the next digits (4 and 2).\n   4 + 2 = 6. \n   We write 0 in the sixty-fives place and carry over 1 to the next digit (the three-sixties place).\n\n  $2343_6$\n  $15325_6$\n  $-1124$\n  $-$\n\n5. Add the carried over 1 to the three-sixties place (2 and 1).\n   2 + 1 + 1 = 4. \n   We write 4 in the three-sixties place.\n\n  $2343_6$\n  $15325_6$\n  $-11245$\n  $-$\n\n6. Add the next digit (1 and 5).\n   1 + 5 = 6. \n   We write 0 in the nine-sixties place and carry over 1 to the next digit (the hundred-forties place).\n\n  $2343_6$\n  $15325_6$\n  $-112456$\n  $-$\n\n7. Add the carried over 1 to the hundred-forties place (1 and 1).\n   1 + 1 + 1 = 3. \n   We write 3 in the hundred-forties place.\n\n  $2343_6$\n  $15325_6$\n  $-1124563$\n  $-$\n\n8. Add the next digit (5 and 3).\n   5 + 3 = 8. \n   We write 2 in the six-hundred-forties place and carry over 1 to the next digit (the two-thousands place).\n\n  $2343_6$\n  $15325_6$\n  $-11245623$\n  $-$\n\n9. The final step is to add the next digits (0 and 1). We write 1 in the thirty-two-thousands place.\n\n  $2343_6$\n  $15325_6$\n  $-112456123$\n  $-$\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{1231453_6}$."
