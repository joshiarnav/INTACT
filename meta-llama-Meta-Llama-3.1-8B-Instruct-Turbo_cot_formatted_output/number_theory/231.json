    "problem": "Find the number of odd digits in the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$.",
    "solution": "We begin by converting $233_{10}$ into base-4. Since $4^3=64$ is the largest power of 4 that is less than 233, and $3\\cdot64=192$ is the largest multiple of 64 that is less than 233, the coefficient of the $4^3$ term will be 3. From here, we are left with a remainder of $233-192=41$. The largest power of 4 that is less than this number is $4^2=16$, and the largest multiple of 16 that is less than 41 is $2\\cdot16=32$. This leaves us with $41-32=9$, which we can express as $2\\cdot4^1+1\\cdot4^0$. So, we find that $233_{10}=3\\cdot4^3+2\\cdot4^2+2\\cdot{4^1}+1\\cdot4^0=3221_4$, which has $\\boxed{2}$ odd digits.",

    "model_solution": "To find the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$, we need to divide it by 4 repeatedly and keep track of the remainders.\n\n1. $233 \\div 4 = 58$ remainder 1\n2. $58 \\div 4 = 14$ remainder 2\n3. $14 \\div 4 = 3$ remainder 2\n4. $3 \\div 4 = 0$ remainder 3\n\nNow, we write down the remainders in reverse order to get the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$, which is $3221_4 = 3 \\cdot 4^3 + 2 \\cdot 4^2 + 2 \\cdot 4^1 + 1 \\cdot 4^0$.\n\nNow that we have the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$, we can see that it contains 3 odd digits (1, 3) and 2 even digits (2).\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the number of odd digits. Counting the number of odd digits, we find that there are $\\boxed{2}$ odd digits in the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$."
