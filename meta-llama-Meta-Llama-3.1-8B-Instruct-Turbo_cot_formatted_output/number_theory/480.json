    "problem": "Let $g(n)$ be the product of the proper positive integer divisors of $n$. (Recall that a proper divisor of $n$ is a divisor other than $n$.) For how many values of $n$ does $n$ not divide $g(n)$, given that $2 \\le n \\le 50$?",
    "solution": "If $n$ is prime, then $g(n) = 1$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. The primes less than or equal to $50$ are $$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.$$There are $15$ of these primes. Also, if $n$ is the square of a prime, then $g(n) = \\sqrt{n}$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. By looking at the list of primes we already generated, we see that there are four perfect squares of primes less than $50$. If $n$ is any other composite integer, then it can be decomposed into the product of integers $a$ and $b$ with both integers greater than $1$. We have that $ab$ divides $g(n)$ (since $g(n)$ is the product of a collection of integers including $a$ and $b$). Since $ab=n$, this implies that $n$ divides $g(n)$. As a result, there are $15 + 4 = \\boxed{19}$ values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$, given that $2 \\le n \\le 50$.\n\nStep 1: Identify the prime numbers in the given range $2 \\le n \\le 50$. Prime numbers are numbers that have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. For prime numbers, the product of their proper positive integer divisors is always 1, since the only proper divisor of a prime number is 1. Therefore, the prime numbers will be the values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$. The prime numbers between 2 and 50 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47.\n\nStep 2: Identify the perfect squares of prime numbers in the given range $2 \\le n \\le 50$. Perfect squares of prime numbers are numbers that have only one prime factor. For perfect squares of prime numbers, the product of their proper positive integer divisors is equal to the prime number itself. Therefore, the perfect squares of prime numbers will also be the values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$. The perfect squares of prime numbers between 2 and 50 are: 4, 9, 25, and 49.\n\nStep 3: Identify the composite numbers in the given range $2 \\le n \\le 50$ that are not perfect squares of prime numbers. Composite numbers are numbers that have more than two distinct positive divisors. For composite numbers that are not perfect squares of prime numbers, the product of their proper positive integer divisors will be greater than 1 and will not be equal to $n$. Therefore, these composite numbers will be the values of $n$ for which $n$ does divide $g(n)$. However, we are interested in the values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$. So we should exclude these composite numbers from our count.\n\nStep 4: Combine the results from step 1 and step 2 to find the total number of values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$. \n\nThe prime numbers and the perfect squares of prime numbers in the range $2 \\le n \\le 50$ are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 4, 9, 25, and 49.\n\nTherefore, the total number of values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$ is 16 + 4 = 20.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{15}$."
