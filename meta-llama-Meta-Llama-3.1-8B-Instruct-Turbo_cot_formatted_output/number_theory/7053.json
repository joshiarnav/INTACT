    "solution": "The $231$ cubes which are not visible must lie below exactly one layer of cubes. Thus, they form a rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension. If the original block has dimensions $l \\times m \\times n$, we must have $(l - 1)\\times(m-1) \\times(n - 1) = 231$. The prime factorization of $231 = 3\\cdot7\\cdot11$, so we have a variety of possibilities; for instance, $l - 1 = 1$ and $m - 1 = 11$ and $n - 1 = 3 \\cdot 7$, among others. However, it should be fairly clear that the way to minimize $l\\cdot m\\cdot n$ is to make $l$ and $m$ and $n$ as close together as possible, which occurs when the smaller block is $3 \\times 7 \\times 11$. Then the extra layer makes the entire block $4\\times8\\times12$, and $N= \\boxed{384}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the smallest possible value of N, we need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** We have N congruent 1-cm cubes glued together to form a solid rectangular block. When viewed from the side, exactly 231 of the cubes are not visible. This means that these 231 cubes are either inside the block or on the edges.\n\n2. **Identifying the Non-Visible Cubes:** The non-visible cubes are either on the edges, corners, or in the interior of the block.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Edge Cubes:** Each edge of the block consists of a certain number of cubes, and we are given that there are 231 non-visible cubes.\n\n4. **Breaking Down the Problem:** Let's consider the block as a rectangular solid with dimensions l (length), w (width), and h (height), where l \u2264 w \u2264 h. \n\n5. **Edge Cubes:** The number of cubes on the edges of the block is given by (l - 1) + (w - 1) + (h - 1) - 2, which accounts for the shared edges between the three faces of the block. This is because the number of non-visible cubes on the edges of the block is the sum of the cubes on each edge minus the shared edges between the faces.\n\n6. **Interiors and Corners:** The number of non-visible cubes in the interior of the block is given by (l - 1)(w - 1)(h - 1) - (l - 1) - (w - 1) - (h - 1) + 1, which accounts for the cubes in the 3D space excluding the edges and corners.\n\n7. **Equation for Non-Visible Cubes:** We can set up an equation to represent the total number of non-visible cubes as the sum of edge cubes and interior/corner cubes.\n\n8. **Simplifying the Equation:** The equation can be simplified to (l - 1) + (w - 1) + (h - 1) - 2 + (l - 1)(w - 1)(h - 1) - (l - 1) - (w - 1) - (h - 1) + 1 = 231.\n\n9. **Further Simplification:** This equation can be rewritten as (l - 1) + (w - 1) + (h - 1) - 2 + (l - 1)(w - 1)(h - 1) - (l + w + h - 3) + 1 = 231.\n\n10. **Final Simplification:** Simplify the equation and get (l - 1)(w - 1)(h - 1) + l + w + h - 3 = 231 + 2 + 1, which becomes (l - 1)(w - 1)(h - 1) + l + w + h - 3 = 234.\n\n11. **Rewriting the Final Equation:** This can be rewritten as (l - 1)(w - 1)(h - 1) + (l + w + h) - 3 = 234.\n\n12. **Final Equation:** This can be rewritten as (l - 1)(w - 1)(h - 1) + (l + w + h) = 237.\n\n13. **Solving for N:** N = lwh = (l)w(h) = (l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1). \n\n14. **Finding the Smallest Value:** We need to find the smallest possible value of N, given the number of non-visible cubes is 231.\n\n15. **Solution:** The minimal solution for (l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1) is when (l + 1) = 6, (w + 1) = 6, (h + 1) = 8.\n\n16. **Answer:** N = (l)w(h) = (5)(5)(7) = 175 + 6 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 6 + 8 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 6 = 228 does not equal N = 192 which has l = 5, w = 6, h = 8 (6*6*8) + 6 + 5 + 7 - 3 = (384) + 18 = 402 which exceeds 231 when we add the non-visible cubes and N = 192 which equals (5)(6)(8) which equals 240 + 6 + 5 + 7 - 3 = (264) + 15 = 279 which also exceeds 231 when we add the non-visible cubes, we find that we must decrease the dimensions of the box to obtain the smallest N possible.\n\n17. **Solution:** The minimal solution for (l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1) is when (l + 1) = 5, (w + 1) = 6, (h + 1) = 8 and N = 5 * 6 * 7 = 210 + 8 + 5 + 6 - 3 = 226, which still exceeds 231, so we need to decrease the dimensions of the box.\n\n18. **Solution:** The minimal solution for (l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1) is when (l + 1) = 5, (w + 1) = 5, (h + 1) = 8 and N = 5 * 5 * 7 = 175 + 8 + 5 + 5 - 3 = 190, which still exceeds 231, so we need to decrease the dimensions of the box.\n\n19. **Solution:** The minimal solution for (l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1) is when (l + 1) = 5, (w + 1) = 6, (h + 1) = 7 and N = 5 * 6 * 7 = 210 + 7 + 5 + 6 - 3 = 225, which still exceeds 231, so we need to decrease the dimensions of the box.\n\n20. **Solution:** The minimal solution for (l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1) is when (l + 1) = 6, (w + 1) = 5, (h + 1) = 7 and N = 6 * 5 * 7 = 210 + 7 + 6 + 5 - 3 = 225, which still exceeds 231, so we need to decrease the dimensions of the box.\n\n21. **Solution:** The minimal solution for (l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1) is when (l + 1) = 5, (w + 1) = 8, (h + 1) = 7 and N = 5 * 8 * 7 = 280 + 7 + 5 + 8 - 3 = 301, which exceeds 231, so we need to decrease the dimensions of the box.\n\n22. **Solution:** The minimal solution for (l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1) is when (l + 1) = 6, (w + 1) = 5, (h + 1) = 8 and N = 6 * 5 * 8 = 240 + 8 + 6 + 5 - 3 = 256, which exceeds 231, so we need to decrease the dimensions of the box.\n\n23. **Solution:** The minimal solution for (l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1) is when (l + 1) = 5, (w + 1) = 6, (h + 1) = 6 and N = 5 * 6 * 6 = 180 + 6 + 5 + 6 - 3 = 194, which still exceeds 231, so we need to decrease the dimensions of the box.\n\n24. **Solution:** The minimal solution for (l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1) is when (l + 1) = 6, (w + 1) = 6, (h + 1) = 6 and N = 6 * 6 * 6 = 216 + 6 + 6 + 6 - 3 = 231 which equals 6 * 6 * 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 - 3 = 231 which equals 6 * 6 * 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 - 3 which equals 6 * 6 * 6 + 15 which equals 6 * 6 * 6 + 15, however we must determine if the values given for the dimensions produce 231 non-visible cubes by testing them with the original equation (l - 1)(w - 1)(h - 1) + l + w + h - 3 = 231 (l - 1)(w - 1)(h - 1) + (l + w + h) = 234 (6 - 1)(6 - 1)(6 - 1) + (6 + 6 + 6) = (5)(5)(5) + (18) = 125 + 18 = 143, which is too low.\n\n25. **Solution:** The minimal"
