    "solution": "The first odd multiple of 3 is 3. The next is 9, then 15, 21, adding 6 each time. The $n$th odd multiple of 3 is $6n-3$; the 10th odd multiple of 3 is therefore $60-3=\\boxed{57}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3, we need to consider the properties of odd numbers and multiples of 3.\n\nFirst, let's list the first few odd multiples of 3: \n- 3 (1st odd multiple of 3)\n- 9 (2nd odd multiple of 3)\n- 15 (3rd odd multiple of 3)\n- 21 (4th odd multiple of 3)\n- 27 (5th odd multiple of 3)\n- 33 (6th odd multiple of 3)\n- 39 (7th odd multiple of 3)\n- 45 (8th odd multiple of 3)\n- 51 (9th odd multiple of 3)\n- 57 (10th odd multiple of 3)\n\nTherefore, the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is $\\boxed{57}$."
