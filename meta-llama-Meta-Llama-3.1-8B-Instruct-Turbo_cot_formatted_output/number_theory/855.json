    "problem": "What is $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\pmod{25}$? Express your answer as an integer from $0$ to $24$, inclusive.",
    "solution": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 3 and 9 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 13 + \\frac 19 \\equiv \\frac{9 + 3}{27} \\equiv \\frac{12}{2} \\equiv \\boxed{6} \\pmod{25}.$$We can justify this as follows: let $a \\equiv 3^{-1} \\pmod{25}$ and $b \\equiv 9^{-1} \\pmod{25}$. Then $27a \\equiv 9 \\pmod{25}$ and $27b \\equiv 3 \\pmod{25}$. Summing these congruences shows that $27(a+b) \\equiv 2(a+b) \\equiv 9 + 3 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{25}$, so $a+b \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}$, as desired.",

    "model_solution": "To find $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\pmod{25}$, we first need to find the modular inverses of $3 \\pmod{25}$ and $3^2 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nThe modular inverse of $a \\pmod{n}$ is the number $b$ such that $ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$. To find the modular inverse, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm or simply check numbers of the form $kn+1$.\n\nFor $3 \\pmod{25}$, we need to find a number $b$ such that $3b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$. We can try numbers of the form $25k+1$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nWe can also observe that $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$ and $3 \\cdot 17 = 51$, which leaves a remainder of $26$ when divided by $25$, or a remainder of $1$, which is what we want. So, $3 \\cdot 17 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$. Therefore, $3^{-1} \\equiv 17 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nNow, we need to find $3^{-2} \\pmod{25}$. We know that $3^{-2} = (3^{-1})^2$, so $(3^{-1})^2 \\equiv (17)^2 \\equiv 289 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nHowever, we can simplify $289 \\pmod{25}$ by subtracting multiples of $25$ from it. $289 = 11 \\cdot 25 + 14$, therefore $289 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nNow, we need to find $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\pmod{25}$. We know that $3^{-1} \\equiv 17 \\pmod{25}$ and $3^{-2} \\equiv 14 \\pmod{25}$, so $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\equiv 17 + 14 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nWe can simplify $17 + 14 \\pmod{25}$ by subtracting multiples of $25$ from it. $17 + 14 = 31$, which is congruent to $6 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{6}$ is the answer."
