    "problem": "Chloe wants to buy a hoodie that costs $\\$32.75$. She empties her wallet and finds she only has three $\\$10$ bills, eight quarters, and a pile of dimes. What is the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ represent the unknown number of dimes. Chloe's total amount of money is $$3(\\$10)+8(\\$.25)+n(\\$.10) \\ge \\$32.75.$$Simplifying gives  \\begin{align*}\n30+2+.10n &\\ge 32.75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\n.10n &\\ge .75 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge \\frac{.75}{.10} \\quad \\implies \\\\\nn &\\ge 7.5.\n\\end{align*}Chloe must have at least $\\boxed{8}$ dimes in her pile.",

    "model_solution": "To find the minimum number of dimes Chloe needs, we'll first calculate the total amount of money she has excluding dimes. \n\nShe has 3 $\\$10$ bills, which is $3 \\times 10 = \\$30$.\nShe has 8 quarters, which is $8 \\times 0.25 = \\$2$.\nSo, in total, she has $\\$30 + \\$2 = \\$32$.\n\nShe wants to buy a $\\$32.75$ hoodie. Since she has $\\$32$, she still needs to make up the difference of $\\$32.75 - \\$32 = \\$0.75$.\n\nSince a dime is worth $\\$0.10$, to find the minimum number of dimes she needs, we divide the difference by the value of a dime. \n$\\$0.75$ \u00f7 $\\$0.10$ = 7.5\n\nSince Chloe can't have a fraction of a dime, she needs to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Chloe needs at least 8 dimes to make up the remaining amount. \n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{8}$."
