    "problem": "In a right triangle with integer length sides, the hypotenuse has length 39 units. How many units is the length of the shorter leg?",
    "solution": "Since they only ask for one length, you can assume that there's only one possible triangle.  Then, quickly note that $39 = 3\\cdot 13$, and that 5 - 12 - 13 is a Pythagorean triple.  Therefore, the shorter leg has length $\\boxed{15}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the length of the shorter leg in the right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b). \n\nGiven that the hypotenuse has a length of 39 units, we can express this as:\n\nc\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n39\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nNow, let's find the square of 39:\n39\u00b2 = 1521\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n1521 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nSince the sides have integer lengths, we need to find two perfect squares that add up to 1521. To simplify the problem, we can start by finding perfect squares that are less than 1521 and then try to find pairs that add up to 1521.\n\nOne of the perfect squares less than 1521 is 36\u00b2 = 1296. Now, we need to find another perfect square that, when added to 1296, equals 1521. \n\nLet's calculate the difference between 1521 and 1296:\n1521 - 1296 = 225\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 225:\n\u221a225 = 15\n\nThis means that 225 is 15\u00b2, which is a perfect square that adds up to 1296 when 1521 is subtracted by it. Thus, our a\u00b2 or b\u00b2 would be 15\u00b2 = 225 and the other would be 1296.\n\nTherefore, the lengths of the sides would be:\na = 15 (shorter leg)\nb = \u221a1296 = 36 (longer leg)\n\nSo, the length of the shorter leg is 15 units.\n\n$\\boxed{15}$"
