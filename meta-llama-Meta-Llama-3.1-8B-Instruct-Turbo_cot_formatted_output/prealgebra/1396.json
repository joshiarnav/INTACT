    "model_solution": "To compute $0.18\\div0.003$, let's think step by step:\n\n1. Move the decimal point of both numbers to the right until the divisor has a whole number. In this case, we need to move the decimal point 3 places to the right for both numbers.\n   - $0.18$ becomes $180$\n   - $0.003$ becomes $3$\n\n2. Now we can rewrite the division as a regular division of whole numbers: $180\\div3$.\n\n3. Perform the division: $180\\div3 = 60$\n\nTherefore, the result of $0.18\\div0.003$ is $\\boxed{60}$."
