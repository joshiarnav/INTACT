    "problem": "Given three members of a group -- Alice, Bob, and Carol -- in how many ways can these three be chosen to be the three officers (president, secretary, and treasurer) of the group, assuming no person holds more than one job?",
    "solution": "In this problem we are choosing a committee, so the order in which we choose the 3 people does not matter.  We could have chosen them in any of the following orders (where A is Alice, B is Bob, and C is Carol): ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.  So each possible committee corresponds to $3! = \\boxed{6}$ possible orderings.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of ways to choose the president, secretary, and treasurer. \n\nStep 1: Choose the president. There are 3 people to choose from (Alice, Bob, and Carol), so there are 3 ways to choose the president.\n\nStep 2: Choose the secretary. Since one person has already been chosen as president, there are only 2 people left to choose from. So, there are 2 ways to choose the secretary.\n\nStep 3: Choose the treasurer. Now, two people have been chosen as president and secretary, leaving only 1 person to choose from. So, there is only 1 way to choose the treasurer.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to choose the three officers, we multiply the number of ways to choose each officer: 3 (president) \u00d7 2 (secretary) \u00d7 1 (treasurer) = 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{6}.$"
