    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to divide the fraction $\\frac{2}{5}$ by the fraction $\\frac{3}{7}$. \n\nWhen we divide one fraction by another, we can multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by swapping its numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, the reciprocal of $\\frac{3}{7}$ is $\\frac{7}{3}$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the division as a multiplication:\n\n$\\frac{~\\frac{2}{5}~}{\\frac{3}{7}} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{7}{3}$\n\nTo multiply two fractions, we multiply their numerators together and multiply their denominators together:\n\n$\\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{(2 \\times 7)}{(5 \\times 3)}$\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction:\n\n$\\frac{(2 \\times 7)}{(5 \\times 3)} = \\frac{14}{15}$\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{14}{15}}$."
