    "model_solution": "To find the number of prime numbers between 30 and 50, we need to identify all the prime numbers in that range. \n\n1. First, we'll list the numbers in the range: 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.\n\n2. We'll then eliminate the composite numbers (numbers that are not prime) in the range. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself.\n\n   - 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, and 50 are all composite numbers because they are divisible by other numbers besides 1 and themselves.\n\n3. Now, let's check the remaining numbers (31, 37, 41, 43, and 47) for primality. We do this by trying to divide each of them by all the prime numbers less than the square root of the number.\n\n   - 31 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. Thus, it's prime.\n   - 37 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. Thus, it's prime.\n   - 41 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11. Thus, it's prime.\n   - 43 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13. Thus, it's prime.\n   - 47 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13. Thus, it's prime.\n\n4. All the remaining numbers in the range are prime. Therefore, the number of prime numbers between 30 and 50 is the number of prime numbers identified in step 3.\n\nSo, the number of prime numbers between 30 and 50 is $\\boxed{5}$."
