    "problem": "In a history class, the probability of earning an A is .7 times the probability of earning a B, and the probability of earning a C is 1.4 times the probability of earning a B. Assuming that all grades are A, B, or C, how many B's will there be in a history class of 31 students?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of students who earn a B. Then we know that the number of students who get an A is $.7x$ and the number of students who earn a C is $1.4x$. Since every student in the class gets an A, B, or C and there are 31 students, this gives us the equation $.7x + x + 1.4x = 31 \\Rightarrow 3.1x = 31 \\Rightarrow x =\\boxed{10}$.",

    "model_solution": "Let's denote the number of B's as B, the number of A's as A, and the number of C's as C. Since all grades are A, B, or C, the total number of students in the history class is the sum of A, B, and C, which is 31.\n\nGiven the probability of earning an A is .7 times the probability of earning a B, and the probability of earning a C is 1.4 times the probability of earning a B, we can set up the following equations:\n\nA = 0.7B\nC = 1.4B\nA + B + C = 31\n\nSubstituting the expressions for A and C in the third equation, we get:\n\n0.7B + B + 1.4B = 31\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3.1B = 31\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\nB = 31 / 3.1\nB = 10\n\nTherefore, there will be $\\boxed{10}$ B's in a history class of 31 students."
