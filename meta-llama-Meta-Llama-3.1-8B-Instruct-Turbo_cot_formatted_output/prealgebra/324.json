    "model_solution": "To find the percentage of sales that were not pens or pencils, we first need to find the percentage of sales that were pens or pencils. \n\nThe percentage of sales that were pens is 38%, and the percentage of sales that were pencils is 35%. \n\nWe can find the percentage of sales that were pens or pencils by adding the two percentages together, but we need to make sure to account for the fact that these two percentages overlap (i.e., some sales were both pens and pencils). \n\nTo account for the overlap, we need to add the two percentages together and then divide by 100 to get the decimal, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. \n\nHowever, the problem states that we should only find the percentage of sales that were not pens or pencils, so we need to subtract the sum of the percentages of sales that were pens and pencils from 100.\n\nFirst, we convert the percentages to decimals by dividing by 100:\n- Pens: 38/100 = 0.38\n- Pencils: 35/100 = 0.35\n\nThen we add the percentages together:\n0.38 + 0.35 = 0.73\n\nNow we subtract this sum from 1 to find the percentage of sales that were not pens or pencils:\n1 - 0.73 = 0.27\n\nFinally, we convert this back to a percentage by multiplying by 100:\n0.27 x 100 = 27%\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{27}$"
