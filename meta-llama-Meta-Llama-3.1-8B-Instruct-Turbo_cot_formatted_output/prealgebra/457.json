    "model_solution": "To simplify the given expression, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. $1-(1+(1-(1+(1-x))))$\n2. Start from the innermost parentheses: $1+(1-x)$\n3. This simplifies to: $2-x$\n4. Now, the expression becomes: $1-(1+(1-(2-x)))$\n5. Next, simplify the innermost parentheses: $1-(2-x)$\n6. This simplifies to: $-1+x$\n7. Now, the expression becomes: $1-(-1+x)$\n8. Simplify the expression: $1+1-x$\n9. This simplifies to: $2-x$\n\nSo, the simplified expression is: $\\boxed{2-x}$"
