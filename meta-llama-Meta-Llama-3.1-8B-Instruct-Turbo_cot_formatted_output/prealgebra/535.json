    "problem": "We have a cube with 4 blue faces and 2 red faces.  What's the probability that when it is rolled, a blue face will be facing up?",
    "solution": "We have 6 equally likely outcomes, corresponding to the 6 faces of the cube.  4 of those 6 outcomes are successful ones (meaning a blue face is facing up).  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",

    "model_solution": "To find the probability of a blue face facing up, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Total number of faces**: A cube has 6 faces.\n2. **Number of blue faces**: The cube has 4 blue faces.\n3. **Number of red faces**: The cube has 2 red faces.\n4. **Probability of a blue face facing up**: This is the number of blue faces divided by the total number of faces.\n\nSo, the probability of a blue face facing up is:\n\n4 (blue faces) / 6 (total faces) = 2/3\n\nTherefore, the probability that a blue face will be facing up when the cube is rolled is $\\boxed{2/3}$."
