    "problem": "A car travels 40 kph for 20 kilometers, 50 kph for 25 kilometers, 60 kph for 45 minutes and 48 kph for 15 minutes. What is the average speed of the car, in kph?",
    "solution": "To find the average speed for the entire trip, we need to divide the total distance by the total time.  Remembering that $d=r\\cdot t$, and looking at each of the four parts of the trip, these pieces can be determined.\n\nFirst, a car traveling at 40 kph for 20 km will be traveling for $20/40=.5$ hours.  Next, a car traveling at 50 kph for 25 km will be traveling for $25/50=.5$ hours.  Next, a car traveling at 60 kph for 45 minutes (.75 hours) will travel a total of $60\\times .75=45$ km during that time.  Finally, a car traveling 48 kph for 15 minutes (.25 hours) will travel a total of $48\\times .25=12$ km.\n\nThe total distance traveled was $20+25+45+12=102$ km.  The total time was $.5+.5+.75+.25=2$ hours.  Therefore, the average speed of the car was $102/2=\\boxed{51}$ kph.",

    "model_solution": "To find the average speed of the car, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.\n\n**Step 1: Find the distance and time for each segment**\n\n1. For the first segment, the car travels at 40 kph for 20 kilometers. We can find the time taken by dividing the distance by the speed:\n   Time = Distance / Speed = 20 km / 40 kph = 0.5 hours\n\n2. For the second segment, the car travels at 50 kph for 25 kilometers. We can find the time taken by dividing the distance by the speed:\n   Time = Distance / Speed = 25 km / 50 kph = 0.5 hours\n\n3. For the third segment, the car travels at 60 kph for 45 minutes. We need to convert the time from minutes to hours:\n   Time (in hours) = 45 minutes / 60 = 0.75 hours\n\n   Now, we can find the distance traveled by multiplying the speed by the time:\n   Distance = Speed x Time = 60 kph x 0.75 hours = 45 km\n\n4. For the fourth segment, the car travels at 48 kph for 15 minutes. We need to convert the time from minutes to hours:\n   Time (in hours) = 15 minutes / 60 = 0.25 hours\n\n   Now, we can find the distance traveled by multiplying the speed by the time:\n   Distance = Speed x Time = 48 kph x 0.25 hours = 12 km\n\n**Step 2: Find the total distance traveled and the total time taken**\n\nTotal Distance = 20 km + 25 km + 45 km + 12 km\n= 102 km\n\nTotal Time = 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours + 0.75 hours + 0.25 hours\n= 2 hours\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the average speed**\n\nAverage Speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n= 102 km / 2 hours\n= 51 kph\n\nTherefore, the average speed of the car is $\\boxed{51}$ kph."
