    "problem": "If $x$ is a positive multiple of 8 and $x^2>100$, but $x<20$, what is $x$?",
    "solution": "This question gives multiple clues on what $x$ could be. Because $x^2>100$, we know that $x$ must be greater than 10, but $x$ is also less than 20. So $x$ is a multiple of 8 that is between 10 and 20. The only value that fits this description is $\\boxed{16}$.",

    "model_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find a positive multiple of 8 that is greater than 10 (since $x^2>100$ implies $x>10$) and less than 20.\n\nFirst, we find the multiples of 8 that are less than 20: \n\n8, 16.\n\nNext, we check if any of these numbers satisfy the condition $x^2>100$. \n\nFor $x=8$, $x^2=64$, which is less than 100.\n\nFor $x=16$, $x^2=256$, which is greater than 100.\n\nHowever, we also need to ensure that $x$ is a multiple of 8, and from the given options, 16 is the only number that satisfies this condition.\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies all the conditions is $x=16$. \n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{16}$."
