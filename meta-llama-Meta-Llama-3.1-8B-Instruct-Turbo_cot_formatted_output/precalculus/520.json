    "model_solution": "To find the shape described by the equation \\(\\rho = c\\) in spherical coordinates, let's break down what each variable represents in spherical coordinates:\n\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the radial distance from the origin to the point in space.\n- \\(\\theta\\) is the azimuthal angle, measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis in the xy-plane.\n- \\(\\phi\\) is the polar angle, measured from the positive z-axis.\n\nGiven \\(\\rho = c\\), this means that every point described by this equation has the same radial distance \\(c\\) from the origin, regardless of the values of \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\phi\\).\n\nNow, let's compare this with the given options:\n\n(A) Line: A line would have a specific direction in space and not be a fixed distance from the origin in all directions.\n\n(B) Circle: A circle is the set of all points in a plane at a fixed distance from a given center point, but it doesn't account for all directions in 3D space.\n\n(C) Plane: A plane doesn't have a fixed distance from any point in space.\n\n(D) Sphere: This option fits the description of \\(\\rho = c\\) perfectly, as it is the set of all points in space at a fixed distance \\(c\\) from the origin.\n\n(E) Cylinder: A cylinder is a 3D shape that extends infinitely in the direction of its axis, so its shape is different from a fixed distance in all directions.\n\n(F) Cone: A cone also has a specific shape that doesn't match the description of \\(\\rho = c\\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{(D)}\\)."
