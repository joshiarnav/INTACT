    "model_solution": "To find $|z|$, we can use the given information and the property of complex numbers that $|wz| = |w||z|$.\n\nGiven that $wz = 12-8i$ and $|w| = \\sqrt{13}$, we can first find the magnitude of $wz$, denoted as $|wz|$.\n\nTo find $|wz|$, we can use the formula $|a+bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.\n\nApplying this formula to $wz = 12-8i$, we get:\n\\[\n|wz| = \\sqrt{(12)^2 + (-8)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 64} = \\sqrt{208} = \\sqrt{16 \\cdot 13} = 4\\sqrt{13}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can use the property $|wz| = |w||z|$. We have $|wz| = 4\\sqrt{13}$ and $|w| = \\sqrt{13}$, so we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\\[\n4\\sqrt{13} = \\sqrt{13} |z|\n\\]\n\nTo find $|z|$, we can divide both sides of the equation by $\\sqrt{13}$:\n\\[\n|z| = \\frac{4\\sqrt{13}}{\\sqrt{13}} = 4\n\\]\n\nTherefore, $|z| = \\boxed{4}$."
