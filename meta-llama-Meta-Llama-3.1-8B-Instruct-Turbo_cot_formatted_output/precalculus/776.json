    "model_solution": "To find the equation of the plane, we can use the normal vector to the plane and a point on the plane. \n\nThe foot of the perpendicular from the origin to the plane is given as (12,-4,3). This point is the intersection of the plane and the line from the origin to the plane. The direction from the origin to this point is the normal vector to the plane. \n\nSo, the normal vector is (12,-4,3).\n\nThe equation of the plane can be written in the form Ax + By + Cz + D = 0, where (A,B,C) is the normal vector and D is a constant.\n\nTo find D, we substitute the point (12,-4,3) into the equation of the plane and solve for D.\n\nLet's use the point (12,-4,3) in the equation of the plane:\n\nA(12) + B(-4) + C(3) + D = 0\n\nSubstitute (A,B,C) = (12,-4,3):\n\n12(12) - 4(-4) + 3(3) + D = 0\n\n144 + 16 + 9 + D = 0\n\n169 + D = 0\n\nD = -169\n\nNow we have the normal vector (A,B,C) = (12,-4,3) and the constant D = -169. \n\nThe equation of the plane is:\n\n12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0\n\nTo ensure that A > 0 and gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|) = 1, we don't need to make any changes to the equation.\n\nThe final equation of the plane is:\n\n12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0\n\nThis is in the required format, so our answer is:\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0}$"
